1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,310
- Ryan, why don't you introduce yourself?

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,420
Let's go right into the
origin story, I think,

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,130
obviously, given that this
is the real estate track.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,990
By show of hands, how
many people know who this

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,960
extremely handsome man is?
(audience cheering)

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,790
Okay so, obviously, I
think a lot of people

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,850
know who you are, but is there
anything that you wanna cover

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,470
or stuff that hasn't
been covered by the show

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,350
or in the mainstream media from a nuance,

10
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,680
something that you think brings value?

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,420
Obviously, you got to
hear the opening keynote,

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,710
so maybe there's some build on that.

13
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,780
As just setting this up before we go into

14
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,240
a little bit of a chat here.

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,160
Is there anything you
think they should know?

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,160
- Sure, I am the original anti-salesmen.

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,350
Like, by far.

18
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,500
I never wanted to be a real
estate broker in my entire life.

19
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,355
I think if you had told
me when I was 10 years old

20
00:00:49,355 --> 00:00:50,920
that I was gonna grow up
to be a real estate broker,

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,000
let alone a real estate broker on TV,

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,107
I would have said that
you're fucking crazy.

23
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:55,940
(audience laughing)

24
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,260
One, because I never
wanted a real job, right?

25
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,110
That was the one thing I ran
away from as hard as possible.

26
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,290
And two, like, real estate, really?

27
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,960
Especially when I was a little kid.

28
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,610
I saw the real estate agents
that my parent worked with,

29
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,430
and I was like, I don't wanna
do that, I wanna be awesome.

30
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,880
I don't wanna be a
broker, that's terrible.

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,130
And then I grew up,

32
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,190
and I went to New York
City to try to be an actor,

33
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,453
and that was way harder than
Brad Pitt makes it seem.

34
00:01:21,453 --> 00:01:22,320
(audience laughing)

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,430
And that was a wake-up call.

36
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,510
And I grew up outside Boston
and then went to college.

37
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,326
Yeah, and then I went to
college in upstate New York.

38
00:01:31,326 --> 00:01:32,340
(audience laughing)

39
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,180
- Just realized there's a
lot more Patriot fans here

40
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,013
than I wanted.

41
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:37,390
- Wait, could I break
from the origin story

42
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,580
for one second to tell a funny story?

43
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,413
- Great.

44
00:01:40,413 --> 00:01:41,870
- So I meet Gary for the first time,

45
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,703
well, I met him before,

46
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,890
but we actually had
breakfast on Monday morning,

47
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,690
and we sit there, and we sit down,

48
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,410
and one of the first
things he says to me is,

49
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,360
you know what, I'm gonna
talk about the Patriots,

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,580
because the Patriots had just
won the AFC Championship,

51
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,080
right, on Sunday, so there's nothing--

52
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,345
- Ryan, this was three days ago.

53
00:01:57,345 --> 00:02:00,251
Everybody's following along, keep going.

54
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:02,320
(audience cheering)

55
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,970
- And he's such a
die-hard awesome Jets fan,

56
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,240
which I think is great,
right, to have love

57
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,940
and everything for his sport that way.

58
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,490
And he said, there's nothing I hate more

59
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,238
than a 33-year-old Patriots fan.

60
00:02:13,238 --> 00:02:14,640
(audience laughing)

61
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,733
So, I'm 33.

62
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:17,680
(laughing)

63
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,630
And I grew up outside Boston.

64
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,330
And I'm a proud Patriots fan,
and it's okay, all right?

65
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,740
- You know what's interesting?

66
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,590
Actually just to build
on something earlier.

67
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,650
My theory on 33, I can't believe that.

68
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,200
I did say that, I said, I was
talking about the Patriots

69
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,120
and I was talking about, if you're 33

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,710
and you've been a Patriot
fan or you're a Boston fan,

71
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,410
you suck, similar to the point
that I was making out there

72
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,780
about if you weren't
punched in the mouth yet,

73
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,750
because you've been in
business since 2009,

74
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,920
if you're 33 and a Boston sports fan,

75
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,040
you've won all four championships,

76
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,460
you win all the time,
and so in a weird way,

77
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,166
I think that slightly makes you a loser.

78
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,040
(audience laughing and applauding)

79
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,380
I do, I do.

80
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,213
- Yes.

81
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,500
- So anyway, go ahead, Ryan.

82
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,950
- So that happened on Monday.

83
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,250
- Tell these two ladies who you are,

84
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,520
'cause they were whispering
to each other, who is that?

85
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,820
- Right, for people who
don't know who I am.

86
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,100
Is this on, right, you can hear?

87
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,540
- Yeah, you're on.

88
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,660
- My name is Ryan Serhant

89
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,540
and I do a TV show on Bravo called,

90
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,130
Million Dollar Listing New York

91
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,680
and I've been on since the beginning.

92
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,670
We started taping that show in 2010,

93
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,600
it didn't come out 'til 2012,

94
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,570
and right now we're taping Season 7,

95
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,680
and I actually have my
own show on Bravo now

96
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,920
called Sell it Like Serhant
that will premiere this spring

97
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,470
I'm not allowed to tell you
when yet because it's a big date

98
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,600
and it'll come out this
spring and it's just me.

99
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,940
So you better watch it,
all these people in here.

100
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,400
It's the first kind of business show

101
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,730
that Bravo has done like this

102
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,970
and so it's gonna be pretty cool.

103
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,310
- Set up your fucking DVR.

104
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,690
Do we still have those,
do they still exist?

105
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,520
No, right, like it's
un-fuckin'-believable.

106
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,860
These technologies come in and out.

107
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,826
All right, so Ryan--
- Yeah.

108
00:03:52,826 --> 00:03:55,620
- You didn't want to do that, but you did,

109
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,820
you know, you were
telling your origin story,

110
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,320
you said a real estate
broker, but one on TV,

111
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,520
that caught my attention
because you did come,

112
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,480
you did want to be a TV,
you wanted to be an actor.

113
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,780
- Yeah, I--

114
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,070
- When did that happen?

115
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,000
- When I was like four, I think.

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,190
I made my little brother do
little home movies with me.

117
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,340
My mom was the videographer and I made,

118
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,290
I had this whole trove of
home movies that I made

119
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,010
where I kill my little
brother, I don't know why.

120
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,279
Every single movie, he
just happens to die.

121
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,690
- Is his name Kenny?

122
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,511
- Yeah, my little brother's name is Jack.

123
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:27,320
And no matter what, though,

124
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,750
I knew that I wanted to
grow up and be successful.

125
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,930
No matter what I did, I
thought it was gonna be acting,

126
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,070
I thought I was gonna
be on Broadway, right,

127
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,700
that was my thing, and it
didn't work out for me.

128
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,180
And I thought that that was devastating.

129
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,700
I did a soap opera for a
little short period of time

130
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,780
when I first came to New York

131
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,290
and then they killed me off, karma, right?

132
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,190
And they killed me off--

133
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,500
- What show, what show?

134
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,990
- As The World Turns.

135
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,580
I took a, Evan Walsh IV, that's who I was,

136
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,220
and I took a syringe to the heart

137
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,890
while I was on top of a hospital

138
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,300
awaiting my helicopter to
take me to the Caribbean

139
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,480
where I could do my research in peace.

140
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,430
And then I thought my life was over.

141
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,810
And I had no money and
I lived in Koreatown

142
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,780
and it was, go home to Colorado

143
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,830
where my parents then moved to

144
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,336
and paint fence for the
rest of my life, or it was--

145
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:12,410
- Hold on, hold on, oh, your
parents lived in Colorado?

146
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,243
- Yeah.

147
00:05:13,243 --> 00:05:14,076
- How long?

148
00:05:14,076 --> 00:05:15,650
- They moved to Colorado
when I graduated high school

149
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,483
in 2002.

150
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,900
- I was gonna make a point
about the Patriots thing,

151
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,733
but keep going.

152
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,223
(audience laughing)

153
00:05:21,223 --> 00:05:22,570
- So, I didn't want to go home and I said,

154
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,700
you know what, I'll stay in New
York, I gotta make this work

155
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,550
because from when I was a little
kid, I chose success first.

156
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,000
Whatever I was gonna do to be successful,

157
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,570
I would figure out later.

158
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,290
And I mean a lot of people who say,

159
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,150
I want to be a successful
real estate agent,

160
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,470
but they choose real estate first,

161
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,000
so they choose something else first.

162
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,440
And I think that's where a lot of people

163
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,860
that make the mistake because if they have

164
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,620
a small little hiccup or a
small little bump in the road,

165
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,610
it's like world over for them.

166
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,070
Oh, I lost that deal, world over.

167
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,240
What am I gonna do, oh, my life is over.

168
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,720
But if you choose success
first, that's what I did.

169
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,014
So I had no money, I lived in Koreatown,

170
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:56,600
I didn't want to go home,

171
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,290
and so I got my real estate license.

172
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,680
It was like 300 bucks at the
time and I rented apartments

173
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,800
for 1,000, 2,000 bucks a
month on 31st and 32nd Street.

174
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,820
And I did shares, I found three people,

175
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,940
put them in a one-bedroom,
put up fake walls,

176
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,270
I ran all over the place.

177
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,110
I didn't have a suit,
and that's what I did.

178
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,760
And then there was an open
casting call in the Real Deal

179
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,700
curbed for a show called
Million Dollar Listing New York,

180
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,260
which is gonna be the New
York franchise of the LA show,

181
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,460
and I went to an open casting call

182
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,770
at the Hudson Hotel with 3,000 agents.

183
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,230
And they took everyone
30 seconds at a time,

184
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,580
with 3,000 of us, and they said,

185
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,780
why should you be on the show?

186
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,420
And I said, why the fuck do you think

187
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,989
I should be on this show?

188
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:36,660
- You showed 'em your face?

189
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,520
- No, I just said, all I
said was, I'm the greatest.

190
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,222
And they bought it.

191
00:06:41,222 --> 00:06:43,318
(audience laughing)

192
00:06:43,318 --> 00:06:45,000
And then I had to figure it out

193
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,850
after six months of casting and they said,

194
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,950
okay, we're gonna put you on the show

195
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,783
and there were four of us.

196
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,830
- Ryan, on a serious note,

197
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,480
the greatest, definitely
came out of your mouth

198
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,620
but were you able to say,

199
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,050
like on a very, very tangible
note, were you able to say,

200
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,080
hey look, I was on the
fucking As The World Turns,

201
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,340
obviously, I'm in the game.

202
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,300
Did that like, on a very serious kick?

203
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,930
- Not really, because they
were really pushing to find

204
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,180
the best real estate
agents in New York City.

205
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,380
- Which you weren't.

206
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,800
- No, they started casting
at the beginning 2010.

207
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,120
My first day in real
estate brokerage at all

208
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,680
with September 15, 2008.

209
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,900
That was the day Lehman
Brothers filed for bankruptcy,

210
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,980
which is the only reason I know that date.

211
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,910
Because that was my first
day in the conference room.

212
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,900
Like, dude, I'm gonna be a broker now.

213
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,270
It's gonna be awesome.

214
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,880
And everyone's staring at the TV

215
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,770
as the world comes crashing down

216
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,460
and for a lot of people,
right, it was awful.

217
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,710
For me, I had no money.

218
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,360
- For everybody to,
because I think I'm gonna

219
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,160
bounce a little bit from the talk earlier.

220
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,800
It's interesting, I almost feel weird

221
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,920
because I feel like we're
about to predict like a crash,

222
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,210
like we keep referencing
this day back in 2008.

223
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,920
Just for, again, for people
that are early in their career

224
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,620
or were in different businesses.

225
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,500
On that day, within 24
hours, Wine Library,

226
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,080
when you sell wine, you can pre-sell it

227
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,460
and you can sell futures,
so we get to take the money

228
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,570
and the customer gets to
save a lot of money on a wine

229
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,780
that comes out 18 months
later, and you can only do that

230
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,410
with the most sought-after wine, right?

231
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,750
No different than the most sought-after

232
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,530
anything that you do, right?

233
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,560
Literally, within 24 hours of that day,

234
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,500
we had 1.7 million dollars

235
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,420
of 2.4 million dollars
of Bordeaux that was sold

236
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,710
have to be refunded because
that many people knew

237
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:29,120
the world had just crashed or
worked at a Wall Street firm.

238
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,450
Literally, that's how
much it melted, literally.

239
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,380
And don't forget, we're
playing on that float

240
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,370
so we're using those
dollars for other things

241
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,570
'cause it's in, and you
know up until that point,

242
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,500
for nine years, we had 1% cancellations.

243
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,100
So it was a significant, I
mean, like you're not joking.

244
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,110
If you walked in like, you
know, wide-eyed and excited,

245
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,070
like literally the veterans
in that office were like,

246
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,850
fuck, we're about to go through

247
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,220
a three to five year
window of straight shit.

248
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,870
- Yeah, and so, hindsight's 20/20.

249
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,130
So it was the worst time
to get started in business,

250
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,400
but at the same time, it
was the absolute best time

251
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,570
because a lot of brokers were
getting out of the business,

252
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,910
right, the guy who got
me into the business,

253
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,450
a friend of mine from college,

254
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,490
he was selling apartments on Craigslist,

255
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,430
that's all he needed to do.

256
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,490
Put ads on Craigslist,

257
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,920
would meet people on the street corner,

258
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,040
take them a few buildings
in New York City.

259
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,310
They'd buy one, contracts
were signed on the spot,

260
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,100
10% deposit stated income
loans all day, that was it.

261
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,690
The day I started, all
of that disappeared.

262
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,480
So with the reason I
got into the business--

263
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,860
- Hey, bro, it's just Craigslist.

264
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,440
we're gonna fucking kill it.

265
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,560
- And people were starting
up brokerages everywhere,

266
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,190
right, when times are great
everyone can do anything.

267
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,200
And so I said, okay, I'll
do this to pay my rent,

268
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,750
pay for food, and that
way I can go to auditions

269
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,640
and do things, you know,
that I want to do on my own.

270
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,880
And then the minute I did my
first deal and I made $1,000

271
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,420
because I rented a
$2,000-a-month apartment

272
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,690
and commissions, you know,
in New York City anyway,

273
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,030
are one month's rent,
let's say, on a rental,

274
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,120
and a brand new broker, you
take 50-50 with the house.

275
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,970
And that was a one day showing,
I got $1,000 and I was rich.

276
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,265
And I remember that day, it
was models and bottles all day.

277
00:10:07,265 --> 00:10:11,037
(audience laughing)

278
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:13,260
- So you flew back to Boston
because you definitely

279
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,610
couldn't have afforded that in New York,

280
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,200
which is a first-rate City.

281
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,090
- Well, exactly, my rent where I was,

282
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:24,090
was $1167 at the time,
so that was towards rent.

283
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,800
And then I just wanted to make sure

284
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,260
that I did as many deals as possible.

285
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,110
Then all of a sudden I
was like, wait a minute,

286
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,950
there's only so much time in the day.

287
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,160
Why am i spending so much time

288
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,320
going to Actors Equity
auditions and sitting here

289
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,270
and being told no to my face
and no about my gray hair

290
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,070
and no about this and no
about that, it's so personal,

291
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,820
when I can meet people on the street,

292
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,470
I could show them
apartments that aren't mine,

293
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,090
I don't have to do anything else

294
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,220
other than make personal connections,

295
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,760
and then if they like a
space, I get paid for it.

296
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,880
Like, I didn't create anything,

297
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,790
especially when I was a brand new agent.

298
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,430
I was like, this is a job?

299
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,070
And anybody can do it.

300
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:03,660
You can get off a boat in
New York City with under $500

301
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,493
and that is it,

302
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:07,040
you can make millions
and millions of dollars

303
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,360
and all you have to do
is meet human beings?

304
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,800
And that was my ah ha moment, right?

305
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,290
And there was a guy in my office--

306
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,650
- If you have the
serendipity of your parents

307
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:19,320
having sex at the exact moment
that gave you the charisma

308
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,060
and people skills to be
able to do that, right?

309
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,840
I mean, I think the thing
that's super-interesting for me

310
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,310
from afar about this industry is that--

311
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,547
- I'll respond.

312
00:11:27,547 --> 00:11:30,177
(audience laughing)

313
00:11:30,177 --> 00:11:33,300
- The game is extremely lucrative

314
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,700
for a certain personality trait.

315
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,220
To me, what's so attractive
about this industry is,

316
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,220
it is the greatest ROI, if you
have a certain human skill,

317
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,300
because there's a ton of people
who can never sell anything

318
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,680
because their personal skills suck, right?

319
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,830
Like, the emotional intelligence,

320
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,130
which is emerging in society, period,

321
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,700
has always been a huge
arbitrage in real estate.

322
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,380
No, I'm asking?

323
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,213
- I disagree.

324
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:02,046
- Go ahead.

325
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,950
- When I first got into real estate,

326
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,600
that was my one deal, I got addicted.

327
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,560
And then like most people
who get into real estate,

328
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,220
I did no deals and then
I couldn't figure it out.

329
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,000
I was like, this sucks, this sucks.

330
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,880
But there was a guy in my office,

331
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,490
his name was Ben, and he
was from Bed-Stuy Brooklyn,

332
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,160
get his first kit when he was 17.

333
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,330
- Ben from Bed-Stuy.

334
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,163
- Yeah.

335
00:12:23,163 --> 00:12:24,134
- Okay, keep going.

336
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:26,330
- Right, gets his first kit
when he was 17, he sold drugs,

337
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,600
and he got into real estate
to help pay the bills.

338
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,470
And he did deals every single day.

339
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,520
- 'Cause he was a drug dealer.

340
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,420
That's the best fucking
training in the game.

341
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,735
- Maybe, maybe.

342
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:36,710
(audience laughing and applauding)

343
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,220
- I only want a higher drug, but--

344
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,060
- He was completely quiet, you should.

345
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,660
- Guys drug-dealing, listen,
I make a lot of content

346
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,690
for 15 to 17 year-olds on
Instagram and I hit up,

347
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,440
I talk to them on DM all the time

348
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,360
and these kids are fucking
selling a lot of weed

349
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,380
and I'm like dick-face, do you understand

350
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,600
that you all you have to do
is just take that same skill

351
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,790
and make that about Yeezys and Supremes

352
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,490
and you'll make 10X the
money and you'll be legit.

353
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,370
I mean, drug dealing
is the training ground

354
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,446
for gangsters and sales.

355
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:07,890
(audience laughing and applauding)

356
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,210
Because not only do you have to sell,

357
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,290
you have to fucking navigate the law.

358
00:13:14,304 --> 00:13:15,530
And your parents...

359
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,090
I'm a big fan of drug dealers.

360
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,360
- No one who works for me
sells drugs, by the way.

361
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,080
But I don't think it's just charisma.

362
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,720
I think anybody can sell,
anybody can be taught to sell.

363
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,190
Obviously, there are people
with natural-born talent,

364
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,000
who have charisma, who
have great personalities

365
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,170
and they're people-people.

366
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,510
But then there are other people
that don't like that like.

367
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,240
That's why I started this
conversation by saying

368
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,680
that I was the anti-salesman.

369
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,850
Dude, I was overweight, chubby,

370
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,410
face riddled with acne
when I was in high school.

371
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,750
I didn't want to talk to anybody,

372
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,400
my Saturday nights were snick, right?

373
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,470
There's guys in here that
I went to high school with.

374
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,500
I didn't have that many friends,

375
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,350
I didn't want to talk
to anybody, I was shy,

376
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,160
totally ruined my self-confidence.

377
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,430
The last thing I ever wanted to do

378
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,580
was go into Starbucks in Manhattan

379
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,810
and try to talk to people
about renting apartments.

380
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,670
Are you kidding me, I don't
know what talking about.

381
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,930
But my back was up against the wall

382
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,780
because I had no money
so I had to figure out,

383
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,950
okay, if I'm gonna stay here,

384
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,330
I've got my real estate license,

385
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,250
I might as well figure out how to do this.

386
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,540
I'm gonna leave my self-consciousness

387
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,860
and my ego at the door,
whatever that might be,

388
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,290
and I'm just gonna start
hawking real estate.

389
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,490
I'm gonna talk about it like
I know what I'm talking about.

390
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,570
I'm just gonna figure it out.

391
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,600
And then I worked every single day.

392
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,460
And that's what the new
show on Bravo is about.

393
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,560
It's called Sell it Like Serhant

394
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,910
and it's working with people

395
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,820
who are the worst salespeople
in the history of the world.

396
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,070
And you will see, it is ridiculous.

397
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,530
And helping them through
what their hurdles are,

398
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,150
figuring out what their wall is,

399
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,240
figuring out what their
what is, what their who is,

400
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,920
what their win is, right?

401
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,680
But your win is just
to make a lot of money,

402
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,040
it's gonna be hard for you,

403
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,260
is how do you work towards that every day?

404
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,580
I'm gonna make a lot of
money today, okay, great.

405
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,290
Okay go do it.

406
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,230
But if you figure out what your
win is and what your wall is

407
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,110
like, what's the worst thing
that could happen to you

408
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,640
if you don't sell something today?

409
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,960
That's your motivation for
tomorrow, and I think that

410
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,010
anybody who doesn't
have a great personality

411
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,610
or great charisma right now

412
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,860
can become a great salesperson,
if they work at it.

413
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,930
But everybody has different
hurdles they gotta get over.

414
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,520
- So let's talk about this,
to make it about the audience.

415
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,190
Obviously, as your profile grew

416
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,070
with the success of the show,

417
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,470
what is the majority of
questions you're being asked

418
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,770
via DMs on Instagram, via email,

419
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,550
when somebody stops you in the street,

420
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,210
what is the current state of questions

421
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,450
in the sector that are coming to you

422
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,920
based on where you're
positioned in the market?

423
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,220
- Everybody asks how to get started.

424
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,090
I mean, everybody asks
me, how do I get started,

425
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,750
or they've been in the
business for a year or two,

426
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,090
and they don't know how to get started.

427
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,500
That's what everybody wants to know.

428
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,810
Even downstairs, we were
on the field with you

429
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,700
and people asking, what do I do?

430
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,840
Like, how do I get over
that kind of like first hump

431
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,180
in the business, I don't know anybody,

432
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,710
I don't have connections, I don't have,

433
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,350
I don't even know, you
know, with the paperwork,

434
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,490
what do I do, and I tell everybody,

435
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,670
there's two things you need to do.

436
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,860
No matter what, you meet five
new people every single day

437
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,880
because you have to add
to your social currency.

438
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,410
We talked about that, right?

439
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:07,060
You got to add to your data book, right?

440
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,880
Your Rolodex, your Excel
sheet, whatever you use.

441
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,540
And you have to work with somebody else.

442
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,650
You cannot do it by yourself.

443
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,510
That was the biggest mistake that I made,

444
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,230
that a lot of people think
they can get into real estate,

445
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,063
they got their license,

446
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:21,080
boom I'm gonna be the best broker ever.

447
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,130
Work with someone who's been
in the business forever,

448
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,910
work for them for free, just
listen to the conversation,

449
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,580
listen to how they talk to people.

450
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,390
Look at how they write their emails,

451
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,820
meet the brokers that they know,

452
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,280
meet the clients that they
know, learn from them.

453
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,020
Take the best, leave the
rest, and do it on your own.

454
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,570
That's what I tell people.

455
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,250
That's it.
(audience applauding)

456
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,250
- It's interesting to
me, obviously, you know,

457
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,890
you've gotten passionate
about teaching sales,

458
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,600
you're reverse-engineering yourself,

459
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,460
because it didn't come naturally.

460
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,080
You just told your high
school story, which was fun.

461
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,040
Do you think it's better for people to,

462
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,880
you know, so I think you think about sales

463
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,730
the way I think about any
skill and I agree with you,

464
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,760
which is, everybody here
can be better at everything.

465
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,730
You could be a better singer
than you are right now.

466
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,960
My biggest question always is,

467
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,240
you could be better at basketball,

468
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,490
you could be better at
playing American football,

469
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,890
but I have a good feeling
that you weren't built

470
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,819
to be on the field here every Sunday.

471
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:25,439
I'm very fascinated by the Mendoza line

472
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,700
of somebody trying to
become a salesperson,

473
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,000
get better at sales,

474
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,040
what's their upside,
because I agree with you,

475
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,630
they can go from here to here,
but does it close the delta

476
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,890
that they should do that
versus spending a lot of time

477
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,620
trying a lot of different
things and becoming self-aware

478
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,840
and figuring out the thing
that has their biggest upside?

479
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,890
When you think about this,
and as you're going through

480
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,580
probably a process that
happened similar to me,

481
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,630
it was my first decade in business,

482
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,710
it was about me
establishing what I wanted,

483
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,060
then you start reverse, you
start asking yourselves like,

484
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,740
how the fuck did this happen,
why is this happening?

485
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,190
Start thinking about
how you were parented,

486
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,510
where you come from, a lot of, you know,

487
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,230
I talk about a lot of this stuff.

488
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,890
I was just curious for myself

489
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,210
and I thought it'd be interesting here,

490
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:13,210
do you think that sales is such
an incredibly core skill set

491
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,070
that everybody should
try to get better at that

492
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,170
or do you think that some people

493
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,800
just have this little upside with that

494
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,810
and the real game is self-awareness

495
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,420
and trying to figure themselves out

496
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,120
because maybe they're an operator,

497
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,900
maybe they're a back-office person,

498
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,680
maybe owning 3% of a company,

499
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,240
where somebody else is
doing all that magic

500
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,610
because they're just
organized and meticulous

501
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,640
and they've got huge upside and that,

502
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,870
they'll never drop any ball

503
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,590
but really their sales will only go up.

504
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,300
So where do you put sales
as a skill and it's upside

505
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,047
versus self-awareness?

506
00:18:44,047 --> 00:18:46,900
- For one, I think that
everybody's a salesperson,

507
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,280
whether you think you are or not, right?

508
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,710
I mean, when I was a little
kid, like I said, right,

509
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,760
I had a little bit of a weight problem.

510
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,670
I was selling my mom on
giving me more pudding.

511
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,980
Like, I really liked
those Jello Snack Packs

512
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,550
with whipped cream on top and
I liked to have three of them.

513
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,210
I don't know why that was a problem.

514
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:05,960
And so my mom, my parents,
didn't want me to eat that much.

515
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,630
And I had to negotiate with them,

516
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,850
I had to sell them on why
I should have an extra one.

517
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,700
I balanced out time,
instead of having them all

518
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,240
right at four o'clock,
said, you know what,

519
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,670
I do one four, one at seven,

520
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,290
and then if I do this one thing for you,

521
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,110
I'll get one before I go to bed.

522
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,170
And that's where I really
learned how to sell.

523
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:23,030
All of us sell something,
even if you're back office,

524
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,180
even if you're IT, you
are selling a program,

525
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,770
you are selling your system
of how to manage email,

526
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,400
you're selling the fact that
you need to come in at 5:00

527
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,480
because that's better for your schedule

528
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,440
than coming in at 9:00

529
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,230
when it's better for
your client's schedule.

530
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,540
So we're all salespeople

531
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,280
and we can all become better salespeople,

532
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,490
which will help us do better
at whatever it is our job is.

533
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,730
But I agree with you in a little bit

534
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,320
that I don't think everybody
should be a real estate agent.

535
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,430
I don't feel that everybody should be

536
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,880
selling body lotion on the street, right?

537
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,660
I worked with someone on
the show who did that.

538
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,340
That's the only reason I mentioned that.

539
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,700
But I think that you have
to find what you love

540
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,500
and that you can actually
make money doing, right?

541
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,120
I kind of hate it when
people say, do what you love

542
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,530
and you'll never work a day in your life.

543
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,530
That's great, if you fucking have money.

544
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,320
- Do you think that, right?

545
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,680
So honestly, I'm very fascinated
by this subject matter.

546
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,010
I know I live a very interesting life.

547
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,080
I was such a terrible student
that a lot of my high school

548
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,160
and specifically my college friends,

549
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,920
and even less so my college friends,

550
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,310
my college acquaintances,

551
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,330
I mean, a stunning percentage
of the people that I knew

552
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:29,330
between six and 22 make
under $75,000 a year.

553
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,180
And a stunning percentage of the people

554
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,710
that I've been doing
business with from 2007

555
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,890
to 2012

556
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,220
make over or have net worth

557
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,260
over five million dollars a year.

558
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,500
And I'm kind of like, I
live almost in this Bizarro,

559
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,340
two different world world.

560
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,930
And I am fascinated by
how many of my friends

561
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,380
that make $67,000 a year

562
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,908
and have hit their zone are
truly truly truly happy.

563
00:20:58,908 --> 00:20:59,741
- That's right.

564
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:02,800
- And how many are at 17
million dollars net worth

565
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,979
and are miserable as fuck.

566
00:21:04,979 --> 00:21:08,920
You know, to me, I
genuinely do believe that

567
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,860
rich is a very funny kind of vague,

568
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,320
self kind of inside game.

569
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,840
So for example, this is just my truth.

570
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,150
When I made $100,000
a year, that was like,

571
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,700
I've never felt the same way since.

572
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,810
I've never felt as at peace.

573
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,830
That was a number for me like,

574
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,490
I was comfortable living my
lifestyle under that monarchy.

575
00:21:32,964 --> 00:21:35,390
I'm fascinated by this conversation.

576
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,120
I really think a lot more,

577
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,940
this is why I talk a lot about
doing, like going very niche.

578
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,130
So for me, I'm a big believer
that a lot of people here

579
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:48,060
who make 236 a year should make 147

580
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:52,470
putting out content around
Alf the sitcom from the 80s.

581
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,660
What I'm fascinated by

582
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,030
is the extreme long tail of the internet

583
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,950
and the monetization of crazy niches.

584
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,080
How many people here are
familiar with the fact

585
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,990
that eight to 10 year-old,
six to 10 year-old girls

586
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:08,500
in America are making slime
at home like in a big way?

587
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,620
So good, do you know
about this phenomenon?

588
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,453
- No.

589
00:22:11,453 --> 00:22:14,940
- Okay, so homemade
slime, right, it's huge.

590
00:22:16,496 --> 00:22:17,840
I know a couple people

591
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,950
who were in love with arts and crafts,

592
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,380
loved making this stuff
and have been doing this,

593
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,640
and making little videos about
slime making for six years.

594
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,800
Literally, that was their
lives and then you know,

595
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,350
the market comes to them.

596
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,560
They were making $13,000 a year
in Adsense three years ago.

597
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,560
Now they're making a million
to two million dollars a year

598
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,660
in branded content and ads

599
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,610
and things of that nature and higher.

600
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,270
I think this is the beginning.

601
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,340
I'm fascinated by the,

602
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,970
do you think the wealth thing
and I think you're right,

603
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,240
and let me tell you where on the subtlety,

604
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,670
rich or what-have-you,

605
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,680
I think it's a lot
easier when your income,

606
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,690
how much you take home, is
controlled by what you spend.

607
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,430
People get stressed
when their balance sheet

608
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,860
and P&L is broken.

609
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,780
So some people know how
to live under 100,000

610
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,890
and there's people in here
making half a million,

611
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,400
but they're buying so much shit
that they're so vulnerable,

612
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,400
and deep down, deep down they are stressed

613
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,260
because they know if shit
hits the fan, they're fucked.

614
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,560
Where do you actually sit
on this happiness of work

615
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,200
dollar kind of conversation?

616
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,290
Like, nuanced, I heard
you, but next level?

617
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,720
- I live and I tell people to live

618
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,680
probably 10% over comfortable, right?

619
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,000
Whatever your comfort level is,

620
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,010
don't go 100% over because
we've all read in the news,

621
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,700
you've seen the articles, you've
seen somebody on the street

622
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,010
who went 100% over comfortable
and that was stupid, right?

623
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,560
So I never tell people to
live outside their means

624
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,010
or to live at their means, either.

625
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,100
Because then how are
you gonna push yourself?

626
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,470
The only way that I got over
$100,000 a year was by saying,

627
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,130
this is great, I'm not broke,

628
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,250
but it's still not enough, right?

629
00:23:57,447 --> 00:23:58,550
- Are you are you at enough now?

630
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,400
- No.

631
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,890
- Do you think you'll ever be at enough?

632
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,370
- No.

633
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,516
No.

634
00:24:03,516 --> 00:24:05,725
- That means you love the process.

635
00:24:05,725 --> 00:24:07,360
That means it's not the money.

636
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,193
- Yeah.

637
00:24:08,193 --> 00:24:09,175
- What's that?

638
00:24:09,175 --> 00:24:11,830
Sure, trust it, but like, he loves it.

639
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:15,070
Trusting it is different
than loving it, right?

640
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,230
I don't trust that if I
work hard, it'll be okay.

641
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,970
I love working hard.

642
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:20,803
- Yeah.

643
00:24:20,803 --> 00:24:24,115
- I love fucking being the working dog--

644
00:24:24,115 --> 00:24:25,715
- And I love working for myself.

645
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,650
- Because, well, he just loves
he just loves the process.

646
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,700
- What's up, Ruben?

647
00:24:33,535 --> 00:24:37,100
- So you think you love the process.

648
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,590
- I love the work, right?
- Right.

649
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,060
- I love the process and I love,

650
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,630
I love doing whatever I
want to do every single day

651
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,830
and not having to punch in or punch out.

652
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,280
I just didn't want to do it.

653
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,270
I was like, I'm gonna live a short life

654
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,830
and then I will die, and that will be it.

655
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,330
And the worst thing in the
world for me is to say,

656
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,300
good thing I went to my job.

657
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,670
Like, that sucks, and that
terrified me when I was 10.

658
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,260
I remember like crying in the bathtub.

659
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,444
I was a weird little kid, but
I was crying in the bathtub

660
00:25:05,444 --> 00:25:08,990
about growing up doing
nothing and then dying.

661
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,300
And so I said to myself--

662
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,770
- Do you have any clue why that happened?

663
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,870
Was there like a grandparent, a parent?

664
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,520
Did you watch some weird soap opera?

665
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,100
Do you have any clue
why that was happening?

666
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,470
- I think a lot of it came
from my parents, for sure.

667
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,560
A lot of it came from my parents.

668
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,480
I was raised very, very strict,

669
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,240
and they always had me
work incredibly hard

670
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,640
to understand the value of
the dollar, the value of work,

671
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,620
and the value of making
something of yourself

672
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,620
because no one else is going to do it.

673
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,810
And that's what was hard
for me about acting,

674
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,050
that I could do the best
audition ever, right--

675
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,190
- But somebody else had control.

676
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,580
- Yeah, someone else had control.

677
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,460
Or someone else looked a different way,

678
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,293
or someone else did that.

679
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:45,500
- Do you, knowing that you're vlogging now

680
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,520
and building your profile,

681
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,280
do you view the way I'm producing media

682
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,230
as potentially a better way than the way

683
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,830
that you're doing it through television?

684
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,580
Because you have even more control?

685
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,413
- Uh oh.

686
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,810
- Because listening to you carefully,

687
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,740
what must be massively frustrating

688
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,640
is the way they post-edit the show

689
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,710
when you knew that you put magic,

690
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,280
but they're trying to create
a narrative on that episode.

691
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,130
- Sort of, I mean, listen, TV is TV.

692
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,930
Maybe it will eventually change,

693
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,630
but networks have been
pretty good recently

694
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,600
about adapting different forms of media.

695
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,510
And I would not be here
today if it weren't--

696
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:24,070
- Right, ultimately the
ROI is so extraordinary

697
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,903
in the direction,

698
00:26:24,903 --> 00:26:26,480
you can deal with some
of the shortcomings.

699
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,720
- I mean, of course, and
whatever I put on on TV,

700
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,910
it's not like CGI, it was me doing it.

701
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,570
And if things get cut for
time, they get cut for time.

702
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:36,850
But listen, Million Dollar Listing airs

703
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,570
to 25 million people around the world.

704
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,730
I can't do that, even on social media.

705
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,804
I mean, not right now.

706
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:45,000
- Well, you could.

707
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,360
- Yeah, maybe, eventually,

708
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,377
but not when I'm a 33 Patriots fan, right?

709
00:26:49,377 --> 00:26:50,210
- I get it.
- Right?

710
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,043
- I get it.

711
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,090
- So especially when
you're starting, right?

712
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,296
That was a huge layup for me.

713
00:26:54,296 --> 00:26:55,870
Oh, it's the catalyst.

714
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,530
- But I think that
what's great now is that

715
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:02,530
you don't have to wait for a
3,000-person open casting call.

716
00:27:02,703 --> 00:27:04,170
You could do what we're talking about.

717
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,370
- How many people watch the show?

718
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,610
Okay, great, quite a bit, so
let's get into some of that.

719
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:12,810
Who is your favorite cast member?

720
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,920
Who are you actually like friendly with,

721
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,840
or like let's get into some of these shit.

722
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,673
- My wife.

723
00:27:16,673 --> 00:27:17,640
- I know that.

724
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,290
- She's right there, by the way.

725
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,260
- I know that.

726
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,700
- I keep looking at her out
of a corner of my right eye.

727
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,755
- Is she the radar?

728
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:25,849
- Yes, she gives me this--

729
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:27,620
- Besides your lovely wife,

730
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,210
who is your favorite, and
there's been different people

731
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,430
that have come in and out, honestly,

732
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,910
you know, there's a positive,
this isn't who do you hate,

733
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:38,240
who of the crew have,
you know, the characters

734
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,420
have you liked the most or
have a relationship with

735
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,253
or maybe you don't,

736
00:27:41,253 --> 00:27:42,490
it's all professional.
- Who of the three of us?

737
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,720
- Well, there's been what,
six of you through the years?

738
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,680
How many have there
been through the years?

739
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,158
- New York, not so many, there
was Michael Lorber, Season 1.

740
00:27:48,158 --> 00:27:49,549
- The dude from the first year, yeah.

741
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:50,382
- And then there was--
- There's a new dude

742
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:51,943
who's a model, Luis.

743
00:27:51,943 --> 00:27:53,020
- And there's Steve.

744
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,350
- So that's it, six.

745
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,610
- Yeah.
- Okay.

746
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,570
- I mean, I've always
had the best camaraderie,

747
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,210
even though we've had some
ups and downs with Fred

748
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,610
because we've been in it
together from the beginning.

749
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,270
He's also 10 years older than I am

750
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,230
and so we were never like contemporaries,

751
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,740
we weren't peers.

752
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,573
- Right.

753
00:28:08,573 --> 00:28:10,070
- I was young and he was doing, you know,

754
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,640
he'd been in the business for 10 years.

755
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,160
I still haven't, to this day,

756
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,880
been in this business for 10 years.

757
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,370
My 10-year anniversary is this September,

758
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,500
and so he had already
been doing real estate.

759
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,440
So I got into it trying to figure out

760
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,940
how the hell am I gonna find listings

761
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,650
to put on a Million Dollar Listing show?

762
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,810
I'm renting apartments in
the financial district.

763
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,230
I told them I was the greatest broker

764
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,320
in the history of the world, holy shit.

765
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,560
I gotta figure this out,
and that's what I did.

766
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,760
It was the best thing
that the show did for me,

767
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,010
was it was a metaphorical
shotgun to my head

768
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,300
to not stop working because
the last thing I needed

769
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,450
was a show to millions of
people telling everyone

770
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,610
that I sucked at real estate.

771
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,390
That would be no good for business,

772
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,730
so I made sure that,

773
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,045
and I always think about
future Ryan, right,

774
00:28:53,045 --> 00:28:54,810
myself five years from now,

775
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,640
because I don't care about
myself yesterday, he's dead.

776
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,770
I care about myself tomorrow,

777
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,330
I care about myself in five years.

778
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,480
So I think every day about future Ryan,

779
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,640
what should I pitch today
that will help future Ryan.

780
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,460
And the same thing with the show, right?

781
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,750
We film a year in advance sometimes.

782
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,080
- I have a good idea for you, real quick.

783
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,159
- Yeah.

784
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,810
- Where's your team,
like your content team?

785
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,601
- They're there, that's Adam,
that's Alice, that's Joe.

786
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:20,870
- You guys have to get
somebody to draw a future Adam,

787
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,750
a future Ryan, excuse
me, you have to create

788
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,890
a future Ryan cartoon character
and when you reference it

789
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,710
you need to edit it in, cool.

790
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,711
- Do that.

791
00:29:29,711 --> 00:29:30,800
(laughing)

792
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,893
Dude, I'll talk to you, I got
you, it'll be a stick figure.

793
00:29:33,893 --> 00:29:35,872
- I think it's an
interesting thought, right?

794
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,850
I think it's super-important to,

795
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,160
not project like, I'm gonna be successful,

796
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,270
it's just being, it's
about being thoughtful

797
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,520
about the chess moves and
creating your strategy

798
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,490
of where you want to be,
you know, from a happy zone,

799
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,320
from a financial zone,
from a professional zone.

800
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,153
- Yeah.

801
00:29:51,153 --> 00:29:53,121
Because everyone talks
about living in the now.

802
00:29:53,121 --> 00:29:57,390
That's great, but the now is
whoever you prepared to be

803
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,940
for the last five years, right?

804
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,830
So, I know I came to New
York City to be an actor,

805
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,760
but it's a bit serendipitous
that I quit acting,

806
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,560
well, I was fired, but quit,

807
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,530
got out of it, didn't like
it, hated that business.

808
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,950
No one in college teaches
you the business of acting.

809
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,990
They teach you how to
be a clock and a frog

810
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,410
and that's your craft, and
then you go to New York,

811
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,430
and they're like, we don't
want you to be a frog,

812
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,150
we want you to look like
this and dance like this.

813
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,870
No, okay, no money for you.

814
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:26,180
And that by getting out of it
and getting into real estate,

815
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,330
I then get back in front of a camera

816
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:31,680
to do what I wanted to do
in the first place anyway

817
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,010
because I set up those building
blocks from the beginning.

818
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,340
So that was my story, those
are my building blocks.

819
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,090
You have to figure out what your own are.

820
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:41,480
Like what is it, maybe
it's real estate and food.

821
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,310
There are agents I know who
are so obsessed with food,

822
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,880
that's their passion, real
estate to them is a job,

823
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,780
and so they mix them both.

824
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,090
Every week, they have weekly
dinners with their clients.

825
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,720
They cook, they figure out new recipes,

826
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,060
every listing they do,

827
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,080
they take listing photos with food in it

828
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,870
because that's what they
love, that's what gets them up

829
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,490
every single day, that's their thing.

830
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:03,060
If your thing is cats, cat it up, right?

831
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,690
Want cats everywhere, if
that's what makes you happy

832
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,960
because progress is happiness.

833
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,490
And if you're doing a
little bit more tomorrow

834
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,420
than you were doing today,
that's gonna set you up

835
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,730
for future you.

836
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,160
And if you don't think that
way, then I don't know.

837
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,820
That's my stress, my stress
isn't financial stress.

838
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,670
Even if I buy something,
even if I do something,

839
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,110
I know I'm gonna work my ass off,

840
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,660
everything's gonna be okay,
I don't let that affect me.

841
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,950
What I let affect me is
that I'm not planning

842
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,660
and that I'm not using
enough of my potential

843
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,230
because one day I will be dead, right?

844
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,830
And then you know, you talk
about this a lot, as well,

845
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,160
that one day we will be dead,

846
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,350
and did you milk your potential

847
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,970
as much as you possibly could?

848
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,580
- I think that's why--
- Five people a day.

849
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,000
- I think it's hard to quantify
how ridiculously rare it is

850
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,100
to become a human being, it's
just not what we think about,

851
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,230
and then how quickly
it all happens, right?

852
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:48,270
Like I mean, it just goes so fast, right?

853
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,370
You know, it's the same
old thing in life, right?

854
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,480
It takes forever, but
it seems like yesterday.

855
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,600
But yeah, to me the bigger issue at hand

856
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,930
is the practical things.

857
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:00,420
There were humans like us who
lived during the Black Plague.

858
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,950
That was in the world and a
stunning amount of us died.

859
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,640
People that lived during
the great, you know,

860
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,730
the greatest generation.

861
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,730
We talk a lot about in the U.S. were like,

862
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,170
for a lot of people that
were born in the late 1800s,

863
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:16,240
like you know, early 1900s,
the prime of their lives

864
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,360
were during real conflict in the world,

865
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,690
wars and things of that nature.

866
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:23,920
We, all of us, everyone
from the oldest person here

867
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,830
to the youngest, have lived
in unbelievable prosperity.

868
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,350
It has been so.

869
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,183
I don't know.

870
00:32:33,183 --> 00:32:37,420
I like looking at history
to, things wrap around data.

871
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,690
It is very impossible
for me to get excited

872
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,300
about complaining about dumb shit,

873
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,430
like the line was too
long, or I got the wrong,

874
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,350
I got skim milk instead of almond milk.

875
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,510
Stuff that I hear people talk about,

876
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,990
when we, us humans, are living through

877
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,050
the greatest era that humans
have ever lived through,

878
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:00,640
of prosperity and wealth
and happiness and health.

879
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,480
This is ridiculous,
and now on top of that,

880
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,610
you layer this thing called the Internet,

881
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,930
which is a new invention
on the consumer side

882
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,380
and scales the living shit

883
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,880
out of all of our ambitions and wants

884
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,330
and eliminates the middleman
that you hate so much.

885
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,290
Winners hate the middleman because

886
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:24,660
that's somebody that can stop merit.

887
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,680
What bothered you was merit.

888
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,940
What I am blown away by, by the Internet

889
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,010
and where all your opportunities
sit is the merit of it all.

890
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,620
If you're not doing well,
it's 'cause you suck.

891
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,560
The market is telling you, you suck.

892
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,820
I love how people are like,

893
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:42,580
how the fuck is that person got
87,000 followers, she sucks.

894
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,860
I'm like, well, you suck
more, because you have 1300,

895
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,510
and you've decided to
make that your judgment.

896
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,630
And not that you should
trade on followers,

897
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,810
but like the day of judging,
you know, back in the day,

898
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:55,760
Rick the casting guy decided
you weren't cute enough,

899
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,200
smiley enough, funny enough,
so Rick could have been flawed.

900
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,200
We are now living in a platform
that is exposing the truths.

901
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:08,100
If you're not doing well, it
means you're not good at it.

902
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,500
And so many people are spending time

903
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,810
trying to tear down
other people's buildings

904
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,759
instead of focusing on how to
getting their shit together.

905
00:34:14,759 --> 00:34:15,983
What up.
- Yeah.

906
00:34:15,983 --> 00:34:17,620
- I got an interesting question here

907
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,850
that I've been thinking about.

908
00:34:20,779 --> 00:34:24,699
What happens to future Ryan in five years?

909
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:26,159
Where are you, like right this second,

910
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,059
you're thinking about him.

911
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,270
I'm dying to hear your
current bullet points on him.

912
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,489
- Someone just asked me that on the field.

913
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,089
They thought, where is everything
gonna be in five years?

914
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:40,460
And I think more than just me, I think,

915
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,610
I mean, how many people in
here are real estate agents

916
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,650
or real estate brokers?

917
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,050
- All of them, this is
the real estate track.

918
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:45,983
- Oh thanks.

919
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:46,815
(audience laughing)

920
00:34:46,815 --> 00:34:48,399
Just wanna make sure.

921
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,219
I do these things, and I ask that,

922
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:51,179
and like four people raise their hands.

923
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,694
I'm like, oh, I went to the wrong one.

924
00:34:52,695 --> 00:34:55,050
(laughing)

925
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:59,040
So, I honestly think
within the next five years

926
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,010
the brokerage model as we
know it in the United States

927
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:03,870
will be over, that is my prediction.

928
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,920
- So let's go, that's
a hyperbole statement.

929
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,130
It's a short period of time.

930
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,150
Give me the nuances underneath that.

931
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,680
I'm naive, I don't even know
what the brokerage model is.

932
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,090
Explain in detail what you mean by that.

933
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:17,050
- It's extrapolating on what
you're talking about right now.

934
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,220
It's that anybody can market themselves

935
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,350
in any other way they want,

936
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,160
they can cut out the middle person.

937
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,610
Why do I have to go to a brokerage
that takes 20%, 10%, 30%,

938
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:29,900
50% for me to go and meet
somebody to make money

939
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,570
when I showed them an apartment
or sell them an apartment?

940
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,540
What's the brokerage for?

941
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,540
I understand that there's
a legal need for it now.

942
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,420
But I do think that
that's going to change.

943
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,670
Maybe it's not five years,
maybe it's a little more.

944
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,160
- Are you gonna start your own brokerage?

945
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,800
- I don't think it's gonna be a brokerage.

946
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,100
I don't like the idea
of having a brokerage.

947
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,790
I don't want people to feel
like I own them in some way.

948
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:53,150
Right, like if anyone here
leaves their brokerage today,

949
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,870
any of your contracts that you have signed

950
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,130
that you haven't been paid on,

951
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,570
that brokerage is like, ha ha ha ha ha!

952
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:02,520
I did nothing for this and
I will take a massive cut,

953
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,330
and you can't go do what you want to do.

954
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,770
Some of you might have great agreements,

955
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,650
some of you might be able to cut and run,

956
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,430
I don't know what your situation is.

957
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,220
But most people, they're
tied into that brokerage

958
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,280
and that's a thing.

959
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,870
But does a brokerage
gives you leads every day?

960
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,950
Do they supply anything else other than

961
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,950
maybe some admin work you can
do with a TaskRabbit, right?

962
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,850
Like they say, there is an app for that.

963
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,660
It's an app, it's an app,
you should look it up.

964
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,360
Yeah, you can do things on your own now.

965
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,270
You don't need that brokerage
to pay for that person

966
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,580
to do that thing because
everything is automated.

967
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,880
Everything is automated.

968
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,713
- Oh wait--
- Everything's on YouTube,

969
00:36:34,713 --> 00:36:36,220
everything's out there, you
don't need to do it anymore.

970
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,480
- Guys, wait 'til we get
to AI and machine learning.

971
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,600
TaskRabbit's gonna seem archaic.

972
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,320
It's just gonna automatically happen.

973
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,220
- And I think that instead of having

974
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,880
some powerhouse brokerages,
you're just gonna have a lot

975
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,150
of awesome brokers who
work for themselves,

976
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,610
or work in individual teams

977
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,370
and that's all that needs to happen.

978
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,420
And that's what I want to work towards.

979
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,880
You can tell anybody that I
said that, I just don't care.

980
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,910
- So right.
(audience applauding)

981
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,730
Well, good news, it's
being filmed at scale.

982
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,250
So this is not about telling anybody,

983
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,960
the data is there, it'll
be on the web in a second.

984
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,510
I think what's interesting
to me is it's how

985
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:14,300
AJ and I view the sports
representation business, right?

986
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,460
We started Vayner Sports because
when we look at the agents

987
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,010
that are taking commissions
for doing what has in the past

988
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,520
been important or had a value

989
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,700
but now has become completely different,

990
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,630
and so for me as you're talking,

991
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,620
I'm like, oh I see what he's saying.

992
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,900
It's the same as every business, you know.

993
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,270
What brokerages are gonna have to do

994
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,130
is they're gonna have to evolve.

995
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,760
For example, Vayner has
a much better chance

996
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,868
to start a brokerage because instead of--

997
00:37:39,868 --> 00:37:40,760
- You want to do it?

998
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,690
- Maybe, I think, you know.

999
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,030
Because what I'm realizing is like,

1000
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,780
oh I see, we can take
those fat commissions

1001
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,060
and those healthy commissions,
but what we'll do is,

1002
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,470
we'll create a model where it's not about

1003
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,770
back-office or history,
we're gonna build out

1004
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,810
people's personal brands at scale,

1005
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:59,610
which is actually gonna
lead them into real revenue.

1006
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,470
I'm gonna Vince McMahon you, right?

1007
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,340
I'm gonna make you the Ultimate Warrior,

1008
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,040
I'm gonna make you Hillbilly Jim,

1009
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,920
that's where the money really is,

1010
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,270
it's in actually doing something
that's tangible in reality.

1011
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,120
So even though everybody
could be a badass broker,

1012
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,790
a lot of people, what they
really need is brand equity

1013
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,550
so that the funnel comes in.

1014
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,710
And that's the only thing
the Vayner machine is,

1015
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:23,480
is it's a communication,
you know, Deathstar.

1016
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,313
- 100%.

1017
00:38:24,313 --> 00:38:25,260
- And so that's what it's gonna turn into.

1018
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,160
- Yeah, I mean, look at,
in New York anyway, right,

1019
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,690
we have--
- Got another business.

1020
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,460
- We have designer gyms, right?

1021
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,190
There's designer gyms all
the time, there's everywhere.

1022
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,550
There's Barry's Bootcamp, there's Rumble,

1023
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:37,430
there's Soul Cycle, there's
all these designer gyms.

1024
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,870
I remember when you used to go to the gym

1025
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,260
to lift weights or get on the treadmill.

1026
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,340
Now, especially in New
York and other urban areas,

1027
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,370
you go to work out because of a person.

1028
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:48,070
You go to work out at, not at 9:00 a.m.

1029
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,580
because that's when it's good for you.

1030
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,300
You go at 10:00 a.m., you
work your schedule around,

1031
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,430
because you're going with that trainer,

1032
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,980
and that trainer's gonna
work out the best, right?

1033
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,730
And we're addicted to it now,
I know in New York we are.

1034
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,070
People are addicted to their trainers

1035
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,350
and we wrap our lives around those people

1036
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:04,900
and the gym space, right,
the equinoxes of the world,

1037
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,510
have embraced that and
they're changing that model.

1038
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,440
Same thing as brokerage.

1039
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,430
You don't go to a Douglas Elliman, right,

1040
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,500
because you're gonna
work with that chairman

1041
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,740
or that brand, right, you're
going to that specific agent.

1042
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,900
And so then what's the brand for?

1043
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,800
What's it really do anymore?

1044
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,620
And now I understand that right now,

1045
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,000
still does a little bit, right,

1046
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,790
because the our generation, my generation,

1047
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,850
needs to get a little bit
older to phase things out.

1048
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,690
And we will enact that change

1049
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:34,410
and I will be at the front
of it, I swear to you.

1050
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,557
- That sounds like a good admission.

1051
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:38,960
I mean, look, what you know,

1052
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,771
listening to the scattering of claps

1053
00:39:41,771 --> 00:39:44,270
when you talk about change,

1054
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,970
everybody just listened to
that from their perspective.

1055
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,470
So everybody just consumed

1056
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,070
your four-minute rant on this issue

1057
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,210
of squeezing out the middle, right?

1058
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,250
This is all I think about,

1059
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,830
and I think a lot of
what you're talking about

1060
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,800
is a good subject to
spend the rest of time

1061
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,730
because when I was listening to the claps,

1062
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,010
and the energy of the room,

1063
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,950
everybody just consumed
from their perspective.

1064
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:06,180
If you're new, right, if
you're early in your career,

1065
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,260
you're like, yeah, that's exactly right.

1066
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,570
Like what the fuck, if
you're actually a brokerage,

1067
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:14,180
you're like, fuck this dude,
this is how I make my dollars.

1068
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,890
But this is super important
for everybody to understand.

1069
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:20,360
I spent a lot of time with
companies that look like toys,

1070
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,590
I spent, I loved Toys R Us growing up.

1071
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,730
It was the kingdom, like
when my sister and I

1072
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:26,980
got to go to Toys R Us,

1073
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,813
that was like--
- Great, great, yeah.

1074
00:40:27,813 --> 00:40:29,941
- That was like everything, right?

1075
00:40:29,941 --> 00:40:33,060
And Toys R Us is based in New Jersey,

1076
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,710
and so for the last four years,

1077
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:37,380
I've taken four to six different meetings,

1078
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,670
different restarts and resets

1079
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,820
with the CEO or the CMO of Toys R Us

1080
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,480
over the last six years
because it was emotionally,

1081
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,930
you know, back to being able to do

1082
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:46,860
anything you wanted every time,

1083
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,310
it wasn't gonna be the biggest scope

1084
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,661
or the best use of my time,
it was just fun for me

1085
00:40:50,661 --> 00:40:52,450
because it brought back great memories

1086
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,290
and I wanted Toys R Us as a client.

1087
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,130
And I would go in there and every time,

1088
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:59,450
I would tell them, you
are in deep fucking shit.

1089
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,810
There's basic data here.

1090
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:03,030
Walmart is getting way too
much of the toy business,

1091
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,797
that looks like you, right?

1092
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:07,310
And Amazon's coming for your lunch.

1093
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,890
And influencers are gonna
start selling this stuff

1094
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:13,340
on YouTube Kids directly,
and where are you going?

1095
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,320
And because they didn't
like what they were hearing,

1096
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,300
they didn't hire me,

1097
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,720
and a lot of times people don't hire me,

1098
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,530
they'll just change, they
don't want to pay our premium,

1099
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,630
they go for the second-rate
thing or the third-rate thing,

1100
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:27,900
or try to do it internally
and do it themselves.

1101
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,260
But Toys R Us did neither,
Toys R Us is out of business.

1102
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,720
Toys R Us has no reason
for being out of business.

1103
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,070
They could have made exclusive deals,

1104
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,510
they could have sold directly.

1105
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,380
All the Toys R Us in the country

1106
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,270
could have turned into
entertainment systems and centers.

1107
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,580
You don't want to spend
time with your kids,

1108
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,510
you're gonna drop them off there

1109
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,060
for fucking three hours and left,

1110
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,620
they could have fucking dominated.

1111
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:49,420
But because they were emotional
about how they got there,

1112
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,850
so for everybody who was
just listening to Ryan

1113
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:54,230
and didn't like what was
coming out of his mouth,

1114
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:58,600
what I tell you to do is,
realize, take your money,

1115
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,080
decide if you think he's right,

1116
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,540
I'll give you the preview, he's right.

1117
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,540
It's the Internet, my friends,
it's the fucking Internet.

1118
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:08,650
It's not him or me, it's the Internet.

1119
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:12,090
It eliminates everything
that is commodity.

1120
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:16,220
So listen very carefully,
and adjust your model to be,

1121
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,200
you know, it doesn't have
to, the term brokerage,

1122
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,920
I'm a agency, Vaynermedia is an agency,

1123
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,320
no different than fucking,

1124
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,980
in your world the Elliman and
Remax or Weikart or whatever,

1125
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,210
all that's in that world.

1126
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,970
We have it, too, Ogilvy
and fucking, you know,

1127
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:32,740
WPP and all this, we're the
same but we're different,

1128
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,880
and I think for everybody who cares to be,

1129
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,740
who's on the other side of
the conversation right now,

1130
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,930
who's a brokerage, or building
one, or about to build one,

1131
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:42,290
or cares about one, you can still do that.

1132
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:45,220
What you provide has to change.

1133
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,660
You could build a huge toy store today,

1134
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,970
the biggest one in the world.

1135
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:51,640
What you provide has to change.

1136
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:55,400
A big box in a mall or a solid location

1137
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,400
in a town where you walk in and
you buy it at a decent price

1138
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,860
isn't good enough anymore.

1139
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,470
The same way as in 1954
being in the downtown

1140
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,730
and being a five-and-dime with toys

1141
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:11,340
at a good healthy markup
became vulnerable to Toys R Us.

1142
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,050
This is the thing that pisses me off.

1143
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,800
I know nothing about
the brokerage industry,

1144
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,800
I promise you, the brokerage
thing disrupted something else

1145
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,970
that existed in real estate
30, 60, 90 years ago.

1146
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,400
It's the same game.

1147
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,860
Netflix is gonna get Punk'd one day too.

1148
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,030
Because what happens is
people become complacent

1149
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,770
and so, when you hear that rant,

1150
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:33,670
I just highly recommend that
you're thoughtful about,

1151
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:36,820
instead of saying fuck that,
putting your head in the sand

1152
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:39,920
and thinking it's about a
successful guy's opinion,

1153
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,270
this is about the fucking Internet

1154
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,940
and it's gonna fucking break your face

1155
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,690
unless you ride the wave
because too many of you

1156
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,290
are looking at the wave coming at you

1157
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,630
and you think you're somebody

1158
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:49,880
because you've had some success,

1159
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,820
this thing is gonna fucking kill you.

1160
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,878
- Amen.

1161
00:43:54,878 --> 00:43:57,460
(audience applauding)

1162
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:00,300
- And here's why I'm passionate about it.

1163
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,810
It shouldn't kill you, all you have to do

1164
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:06,410
is have the humility and
patience and work ethic

1165
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,460
to grab that little
surfboard that's right here

1166
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,160
and jump on it and ride this
thing to the fucking moon.

1167
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,976
And my entire rant this morning was,

1168
00:44:15,976 --> 00:44:18,630
you're way ahead of 98%
of the people because

1169
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,770
you wouldn't have spent the
money on the ticket to be here

1170
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:22,540
if you weren't, you have to understand,

1171
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,960
actions louder than words.

1172
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,110
The fact that you know my content, right,

1173
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:27,760
the fact that you even were in a funnel,

1174
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,580
the fact that so many of you traveled,

1175
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,520
how many people here flew
to be at this conference?

1176
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,074
That's fucking ridiculous.

1177
00:44:35,074 --> 00:44:35,907
- Great.

1178
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:38,750
- That's ridiculous, the
fact that you're there,

1179
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,470
the fact that you're
there, you're so close.

1180
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,090
Now the only thing that's holding you back

1181
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:47,460
is the money and how you're making it now

1182
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,440
and the complacency in that.

1183
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:51,990
What do you want to leave everybody with?

1184
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:55,720
What's a good general tone
for what you're seeing

1185
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,180
from your day-to-day life

1186
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,600
as an actual executor of this craft,

1187
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,920
as a personal brand that's
using a different medium,

1188
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,720
as you're getting the tone of
the last talk and this talk,

1189
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,700
what's a good way to close out
these last couple of minutes?

1190
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:09,830
What do you think is a
nuance or a thought starter

1191
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,400
that's a little less theoretical?

1192
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,520
Because I think you've established
a great overall strategy.

1193
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,620
Is there anything that we
haven't touched on in my talk

1194
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,320
or here right now that you
think may bring them value?

1195
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,250
- Oh, I think that,

1196
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,090
listen, I think that a lot of people

1197
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,190
get nervous about the idea of control,

1198
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:28,650
which you talk about a lot,

1199
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:30,870
and if I'm gonna leave
this group with anything,

1200
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,350
and I have one thing to
show everybody, right,

1201
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:34,150
I want to make sure that we do that.

1202
00:45:35,314 --> 00:45:37,300
- This is why I never am like the host

1203
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,970
or the person to ask questions.

1204
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:41,800
I black out when I do talks.

1205
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,120
Literally, there was only
one thing I had to do here,

1206
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,448
and I fucked it up.

1207
00:45:45,448 --> 00:45:47,290
(audience laughing)

1208
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:49,700
Thank you, Ryan for saving me.
- It's all right, don't worry.

1209
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,960
- But obviously, you're
so good at what you do.

1210
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,110
We're about to show you
something pretty rad.

1211
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:55,170
We're approved still, right?

1212
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:56,580
I know at some point it was kind of like,

1213
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,630
can we do it can we not?

1214
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,750
- We still can't do it, but
we're gonna do it anyway.

1215
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,120
- That's really true, right?
- Yeah.

1216
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,350
- So you're breaking
the rules a little bit?

1217
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:04,790
- Yeah but, so control, fuck control.

1218
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:06,508
Right, take control of your own life.

1219
00:46:06,508 --> 00:46:08,457
(audience laughing and applauding)

1220
00:46:08,457 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat orchestral music)
