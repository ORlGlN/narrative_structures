1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
- I get it.

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:02,413
- [Man] Even thought the
department keeps growing,

3
00:00:02,413 --> 00:00:04,169
- Biggie said it right bro,

4
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:05,853
mo money, mo problems.

5
00:00:05,853 --> 00:00:08,853
â™« We're unstoppable

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,993
what up vlog.

7
00:00:17,993 --> 00:00:20,642
About to do a call, just
want to show you Babbin.

8
00:00:20,642 --> 00:00:23,164
You know, just want to show
everybody the man behind

9
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:25,412
D Rock's success.

10
00:00:25,412 --> 00:00:27,642
If the categories looked
at a different way,

11
00:00:27,642 --> 00:00:29,688
they're gonna get
disproportionate opportunity.

12
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:33,719
There is some insane data
that is in their favor

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,438
because of (bleep) who
actually has (bleep)

14
00:00:36,438 --> 00:00:39,131
and because I've been spending
the last year and a half

15
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:41,253
with the CEO, that's leading
to our big opportunity

16
00:00:41,253 --> 00:00:44,156
over here, I disproportionately
know about the fact

17
00:00:44,156 --> 00:00:47,666
that (bleep) a lot of ways
are really, really good

18
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:51,334
when you start figuring
out the impact of how much

19
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:53,649
(bleep) wasted and it's
impact on the environment.

20
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:57,232
Like it's, it's stunning
how good (bleep) is for the

21
00:00:57,232 --> 00:01:00,453
world, but there's no
millennial mom that would

22
00:01:00,453 --> 00:01:01,796
believe that.

23
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:04,141
I think Eric will probably
bring a little more detail

24
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:07,173
and nuance to this, but
that's the task at hand and

25
00:01:07,173 --> 00:01:09,793
we have a big appetite
and a big opportunity and

26
00:01:09,793 --> 00:01:13,118
I think they'll call my
bluff after we come with it

27
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:17,389
to let us execute the
influencer and Facebook video

28
00:01:17,389 --> 00:01:20,068
work that I think can
actually achieve the success,

29
00:01:20,068 --> 00:01:23,650
that's why I'm excited,
that's why we're on this call.

30
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,062
Got it?

31
00:01:25,062 --> 00:01:26,728
- What's going on Gary?

32
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:28,281
Morning, morning.

33
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:29,698
- How's it going?

34
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,023
- [Lev] This came in yesterday.

35
00:01:39,596 --> 00:01:41,660
- This came in yesterday, perfect.

36
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,211
D Lee.

37
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:47,138
Uh, I have really,
really, really bad news.

38
00:01:47,138 --> 00:01:49,478
You bought the wrong jersey.

39
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:50,821
- [Lev] What do you mean?

40
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:52,564
- That's not his number anymore.

41
00:01:52,564 --> 00:01:53,397
- Seriously?

42
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:56,410
- I'm being dead fucking serious.

43
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,743
- [Man] He's 58.

44
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:02,901
(inaudible Russian accent)

45
00:02:03,945 --> 00:02:05,456
- You know what's funny?

46
00:02:05,456 --> 00:02:07,443
Your Russian accent got heavier just now,

47
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:09,781
when the stress came
out, does that happen?

48
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:11,649
- I don't know.
- That was so fucking cool,

49
00:02:11,649 --> 00:02:12,989
I just heard your Russian accent.

50
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:14,815
We need to get a new one,
fast, now, now you've got

51
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:17,004
real work to do, it's Friday,

52
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:18,928
start hustling, start hustling.

53
00:02:18,928 --> 00:02:20,241
- We'll get this done.

54
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:22,045
- Yo, kids at home, when
you get me a jersey,

55
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:25,036
and your name is Lev,
you've got to really hustle

56
00:02:25,036 --> 00:02:26,993
when the number's wrong, my man D Lee is

57
00:02:26,993 --> 00:02:28,905
now number 58, this is last year's jersey.

58
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:31,335
You've got 48 hours my man, fix it.

59
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:33,591
(laughing)

60
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:36,009
- Okay, so I so fucked up.

61
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:38,661
Gary asked me to order him a Jet's jersey,

62
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:42,025
Darron Lee, so what I did, I went online,

63
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:45,041
saw the first jersey
that was Darron Lee's,

64
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:49,862
ordered it, it comes in,
but it's the wrong number.

65
00:02:49,862 --> 00:02:51,866
What do I do now?

66
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:55,269
It's currently 2:16 PM
right now on Friday,

67
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:59,186
the game is on Sunday at
1 PM, I have 47 hours.

68
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,563
I need to find this jersey.

69
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:06,830
- Hello.

70
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,663
- Hi Gary.
- Hi, how are you?

71
00:03:07,663 --> 00:03:08,830
- Good.
- Good.

72
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:11,751
How you guys doing?

73
00:03:11,751 --> 00:03:12,584
- [Group] Great.

74
00:03:12,584 --> 00:03:15,101
- Good, awesome, how's it going so far?

75
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:16,391
Good?

76
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:17,224
- [Group] Yeah.

77
00:03:17,224 --> 00:03:18,359
- You guys awake?

78
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:20,228
We good here, ha ha?

79
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:23,610
Google itself is a toll
booth for all of us,

80
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,240
and then the smart people
built companies on top of

81
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,092
Google to be another toll
booth on top of the Google

82
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:32,495
toll booth, so like the
reason I use that is,

83
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:34,744
I don't think people, a
lot of people if they don't

84
00:03:34,744 --> 00:03:36,527
understand it, or even if
you're in it and been doing

85
00:03:36,527 --> 00:03:38,173
it for years, I think
sometimes we don't think of

86
00:03:38,173 --> 00:03:39,356
it enough as toll booths.

87
00:03:39,356 --> 00:03:42,033
Like, these are, Google's a toll booth,

88
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:44,217
then all the leaders in your
businesses that are referral

89
00:03:44,217 --> 00:03:46,085
sites and affiliate sites
are the next toll booth

90
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:48,065
and they were just better
at getting in front of

91
00:03:48,065 --> 00:03:50,383
somebody before you and
the reason I believe in

92
00:03:50,383 --> 00:03:53,058
brand so much, stuff that
most people in this room

93
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:56,300
hate because it's not quant,
it's not black and white,

94
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,622
it's not I spend four dollars
and I got three dollars

95
00:03:58,622 --> 00:04:01,183
back, okay let me fuck with
it, okay I spend one dollar,

96
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:03,208
I get 13 dollars back, holy
fuck let me spend as much

97
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,391
on it as I can, the
reason everybody hates it,

98
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:07,303
is it's not measurable.

99
00:04:07,303 --> 00:04:10,430
But it's the reason everybody's
here and I'm sitting here.

100
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,818
It's brand, and so the risks
you should all be taking,

101
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:17,248
we'll get to it one by one,
on brand, is extraordinary.

102
00:04:17,248 --> 00:04:20,331
Because it fixes everything else out.

103
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,867
- Okay, so I'm in the car,
this is my last chance,

104
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:29,242
my only hope to find
this jersey I have 40,

105
00:04:29,242 --> 00:04:32,201
about 46 hours remaining until game time,

106
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:35,712
if not today, hopefully tomorrow,

107
00:04:35,712 --> 00:04:38,220
and then if not, then I
just have one last thing

108
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,776
to do and that's go to the
game, buy the jersey there,

109
00:04:41,776 --> 00:04:45,526
and hopefully it'll be
good, if they have it.

110
00:04:47,731 --> 00:04:50,594
- Bo, there's only one way
to win a family business,

111
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:52,282
radical candor.

112
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:56,360
And you know how easy that
is in a family business?

113
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,908
Almost impossible.

114
00:04:57,908 --> 00:05:00,878
So I'm giving you advice
that's hard, radical candor,

115
00:05:00,878 --> 00:05:03,532
and you're just gonna lose,
it's gonna eat you inside.

116
00:05:03,532 --> 00:05:05,850
And I have good news for
you, this is the only chance

117
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,968
to have a good relationship with them,

118
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:09,540
not the other way around.

119
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,472
You think you're doing the
right thing to have a good

120
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:13,577
relationship with them,
you're leading to the things

121
00:05:13,577 --> 00:05:16,681
that's gonna make you have
regrets and real issues

122
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:18,775
with them and you're gonna
snap and you guys are

123
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:19,894
gonna have a bad relationship.

124
00:05:19,894 --> 00:05:21,464
- [Bo] Yeah, that's what I
feel like it's getting to

125
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:24,187
- Oh and you're fucking five
seconds in, second/third

126
00:05:24,187 --> 00:05:27,336
generation family business
people pay the biggest tax

127
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:30,196
in the world, and when
they're fucking talented,

128
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,422
they really are fucked.

129
00:05:32,422 --> 00:05:35,122
You know what family business
dynamics are good for?

130
00:05:35,122 --> 00:05:36,343
Losers.

131
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:40,050
That's when you're lucky,
when you suck shit,

132
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,670
you're the one benefiting.

133
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,139
You know when family businesses suck?

134
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,880
When you're a winner.

135
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,841
And you're paying a tax
nobody's ever paid in life.

136
00:05:47,841 --> 00:05:50,700
Guys I've built a business from
three to 60 million dollars

137
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,198
and left at 34 years
old with $100,000 in my

138
00:05:53,198 --> 00:05:56,191
bank account, because I was
making myself $40-50,000

139
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:59,637
and zero equity on paper to
buy mortgage for me and my wife

140
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:01,681
because I owned zero
percent of my library.

141
00:06:01,681 --> 00:06:04,370
How fucking lucky am I trolls on YouTube?

142
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,373
- The latest update,
it's almost four o'clock,

143
00:06:07,373 --> 00:06:11,340
I'm in the car, driving
there's a little bit of traffic

144
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,427
- So you know what's happening
with all the ad agencies,

145
00:06:14,427 --> 00:06:15,561
creative shops, why they're dead?

146
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:18,531
They started with art
and they hate numbers.

147
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:22,698
'cause art's a lot more fun,
because nobody can keep score.

148
00:06:24,406 --> 00:06:27,075
So you just will yourself to
victory through headlines,

149
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:29,309
awards and being louder.

150
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:33,383
You're in a great spot,
when you bring Artie,

151
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:37,526
you know Rick or Sally,
you're gonna hold them

152
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:40,193
somewhat more accountable while,

153
00:06:41,056 --> 00:06:43,062
let me give you good
piece of advice, do it,

154
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:45,132
bring in somebody who's above the line,

155
00:06:45,132 --> 00:06:48,554
mean creative, whatever,
give them a budget

156
00:06:48,554 --> 00:06:49,922
and don't scrutinize them.

157
00:06:49,922 --> 00:06:52,291
What the three uncle's
fucked up with him is,

158
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,961
they should have just given him it,

159
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:55,417
and gotten the fuck out.

160
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:56,927
If you're gonna bring in
somebody to do creative

161
00:06:56,927 --> 00:06:59,874
or be an editor in chief,
depending on how extreme you go,

162
00:06:59,874 --> 00:07:02,661
this is for a lot of
you, just let, just say,

163
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:04,578
Sally $800,000, do you.

164
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:09,525
Make one KPI, the subjective
call of the two of you

165
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:12,943
that had actually brought
value at the end of one year.

166
00:07:12,943 --> 00:07:15,734
Kim will tell you, the
way I manage, I'm like,

167
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:18,457
I'm not in it, but I'll
look at it at the macro,

168
00:07:18,457 --> 00:07:21,026
because that's how I won, I've always won

169
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:23,521
'cause I do shit that makes no
mathematical sense up front.

170
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:26,021
Until it does, got it?
- yeah.

171
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,936
- So, and by the way, I can
give you another good piece

172
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:32,909
of advice, give that person
the amount of money that

173
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:35,245
you're most comfortable
with going to zero.

174
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:38,055
And then I've got the best part for you,

175
00:07:38,055 --> 00:07:40,456
get 20 percent better at what you do,

176
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:42,534
so that it's a net equal.

177
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:44,535
If you're gonna give this person $100,000

178
00:07:44,535 --> 00:07:48,315
make your $500,000 work
like $600,000 in 2018.

179
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:51,386
'cause you guys can get better
- for sure

180
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:53,694
- That's how you're gonna win, got it?

181
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:55,471
It's fun, you'll get better at your part,

182
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:57,294
which is just smart,

183
00:07:57,294 --> 00:08:00,560
that frees up the 100,
'cause now 500,000 is being

184
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,301
is working as if it's 600,
'cause you're trying harder,

185
00:08:03,301 --> 00:08:05,468
and you get to taste shit.

186
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:11,194
That's the way you build a business.

187
00:08:11,194 --> 00:08:12,058
Guys, thank you so much.

188
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,856
Awesome, thank you,
- thanks.

189
00:08:13,856 --> 00:08:15,401
- Thanks for coming, thanks for coming.

190
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:16,908
- Thank you so much.

191
00:08:16,908 --> 00:08:19,541
- Uh, couple of meetings
now, can't film them,

192
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,679
then wrapping up and heading home,

193
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:24,066
for some family time.

194
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:26,680
Hope Babbin finds something funny,

195
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,568
let's see if Lev can get me
the jersey I'm looking for.

196
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:31,017
- So it's Saturday morning, just woke up,

197
00:08:31,017 --> 00:08:35,640
about to go pick up this
jersey in a couple of hours.

198
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,557
It's time to get ready.

199
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,855
- And I'll see you next
week, a lot of hustle,

200
00:08:40,855 --> 00:00:00,000
a lot of New York time, see ya.
