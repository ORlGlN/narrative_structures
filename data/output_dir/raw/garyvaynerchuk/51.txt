1
00:00:00,279 --> 00:00:01,808
- We're back.

2
00:00:01,808 --> 00:00:02,873
Babin, we back?

3
00:00:02,873 --> 00:00:04,002
- I'll see you back.

4
00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:04,894
- We're back.

5
00:00:04,894 --> 00:00:07,477
(hip-hop beat)

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,157
(hip-hop music)

7
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,526
Big shout out to everybody.

8
00:00:47,526 --> 00:00:48,481
Here with AJ Vee.

9
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,314
(AJ talking on phone)

10
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:51,287
Going to a super,

11
00:00:51,287 --> 00:00:54,086
secret VaynerSports meeting.

12
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:57,447
Obviously if you've been paying
any attention to my social.

13
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,728
VaynerSports, hot time this season.

14
00:00:58,728 --> 00:01:01,851
Building out our draft class,
getting very excited about it.

15
00:01:01,851 --> 00:01:03,690
All the business development with brands.

16
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,965
So we're headed to this meeting.

17
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:05,953
Super excited, had a great holiday.

18
00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:08,135
Hope you guys are well aware
of my Eric Decker t-shirt.

19
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,841
He's on the Titans now but what he did

20
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:11,475
yesterday in the playoff game,

21
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:12,495
everybody was shitting on him.

22
00:01:12,495 --> 00:01:14,806
He was down, he had a big
drop and then he came back

23
00:01:14,806 --> 00:01:16,033
with the perseverance,

24
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:17,654
had the big touchdown to win the game.

25
00:01:17,654 --> 00:01:19,238
Big shout out E.D.

26
00:01:19,238 --> 00:01:20,558
You know I don't like
anybody but the Jets.

27
00:01:20,558 --> 00:01:22,584
But former Jets still
hold a piece of my heart.

28
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:23,447
Anyway, big meeting.

29
00:01:23,447 --> 00:01:24,747
Excited to be here in LA.

30
00:01:24,747 --> 00:01:26,844
CES this week, back on the grind.

31
00:01:26,844 --> 00:01:29,066
Great family time,
great to be checked out.

32
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:30,242
Great to be spending time with AJ.

33
00:01:30,242 --> 00:01:32,256
Great to be spending time
with a lot of you brands.

34
00:01:32,256 --> 00:01:34,968
Making these biz dev
deals with VaynerSports.

35
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:37,784
This will be a fun episode.

36
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:39,576
And I'm ready to go.

37
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:42,243
(hip-hop music)

38
00:01:51,054 --> 00:01:52,824
Had a great break.

39
00:01:52,824 --> 00:01:55,210
Had a lot of time to think about 2018.

40
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,463
Feel very focused.

41
00:01:56,463 --> 00:01:57,858
Nothing too crazy.

42
00:01:57,858 --> 00:01:59,955
Just good solid grinding and

43
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:02,737
focus on the VaynerX world and

44
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:06,070
obviously, K-Swiss, my book,

45
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,991
those kind of things but

46
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:10,101
it's just gonna be a,

47
00:02:10,102 --> 00:02:11,536
it's gonna be a putting your head down,

48
00:02:11,536 --> 00:02:12,762
bring your lunch pale to work,

49
00:02:12,762 --> 00:02:14,852
grinding 15 hours a day kinda thing

50
00:02:14,852 --> 00:02:16,987
and just focused as fuck.

51
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:19,820
Like really fuckin' focused Babin.

52
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:23,762
- Was it good?

53
00:02:23,762 --> 00:02:25,591
- It was actually good.

54
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:26,946
Not gonna lie.

55
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:27,785
- Bro.

56
00:02:27,785 --> 00:02:28,785
- [AJ] Yeah?

57
00:02:30,713 --> 00:02:34,087
- [Gary] It's just a lot to
handle 'cause it's so exciting.

58
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,283
It's just so real.

59
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:37,878
- [AJ] Yup

60
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:39,289
- [Gary] Think about what I talk about.

61
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:40,783
Positivity and Mogul life.

62
00:02:40,783 --> 00:02:43,105
Like it's so good.

63
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:45,620
- [AJ] And legitimate.

64
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,287
It's not like some
fraudster running around.

65
00:02:50,664 --> 00:02:52,199
- Actually let me give you
the meat of this episode

66
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,848
'cause I know a lot of it's
not gonna be able to be seen.

67
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,132
I've come to realize and
it's happening right now

68
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:57,443
with VaynerSports,
obviously it's super fun

69
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,353
to do a second go around
with my favorite man,

70
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:01,020
AJ Vee over here.

71
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:03,765
There's just nothing like the beginning

72
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:05,667
of building a fucking monster.

73
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:06,702
(chuckling)

74
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:08,222
There's nothing like it.

75
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:09,180
- Build.

76
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,626
- I love the underestimated, I love the,

77
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,363
every single thing I've done, people tell,

78
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:17,821
actually the second and
third big thing I did.

79
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:19,445
Why VaynerMedia and why VaynerSports.

80
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:20,466
There's an article on VaynerSports.

81
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,004
There's an article on VaynerMedia.

82
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:24,607
If you dig on the web enough, it says,

83
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:27,655
"He doesn't know what he's
getting into. This is different."

84
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:30,204
Let me just promise all
you fuck faces forever,

85
00:03:30,204 --> 00:03:31,569
none of it's gonna be different.

86
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:34,458
Whatever fuckin' industry I
choose, they're in trouble

87
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:35,743
if we decide to actually do it.

88
00:03:35,743 --> 00:03:37,020
There's gonna be a lot that I flirt with

89
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,853
that I'm gonna talk a little big game

90
00:03:37,853 --> 00:03:39,201
but I'll never go deep.

91
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:42,078
But if we go deep, it's a fuckin' wrap.

92
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:45,015
Curtains on the industry and I just,

93
00:03:45,015 --> 00:03:45,879
this is the most fun.

94
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,682
Like I love the hard
part, I love the X work,

95
00:03:48,682 --> 00:03:50,117
I love getting on the
phone with a bunch of you

96
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:51,935
that are filling out the
Google form for biz dev

97
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:55,655
and negotiating, if you
wanna give 15 thousand,

98
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:57,683
I wanna get it to 25 and like,

99
00:03:57,683 --> 00:03:59,953
you know like, the
commission on that's $1500

100
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:02,284
and it's so not worth my 15 minutes.

101
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,843
But it's like trading a baseball card,

102
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,073
it's the game, the journey, the ride,

103
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:07,759
doing it with somebody
you respect and love

104
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,685
always makes it so much better.

105
00:04:09,685 --> 00:04:12,802
But to be very frank, like I'm
sure it's the same for you,

106
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:17,067
even without that part, I
think I like the part of

107
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:19,203
the unknown, knowing it's gonna happen

108
00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:21,452
but you never know until you know.

109
00:04:21,452 --> 00:04:23,518
The descending voices motivate me.

110
00:04:23,518 --> 00:04:25,801
You know, I don't know if it's a flaw,

111
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:28,527
I don't know if it's strength
but I definitely love it,

112
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:30,114
and then the moments.

113
00:04:30,114 --> 00:04:30,947
- Yeah.

114
00:04:30,947 --> 00:04:33,626
- Like all of you on Twitter, going crazy

115
00:04:33,626 --> 00:04:36,974
when you see in the green room
at the NFL Draft, you know?

116
00:04:36,974 --> 00:04:38,317
That's just funny, like Gary Vee.

117
00:04:38,317 --> 00:04:39,398
And I then I go on like Live and I'm like,

118
00:04:39,398 --> 00:04:40,656
"Ahh, I don't know if
I'm allowed to do this."

119
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:43,108
I get banned, like I'm crazy
like that. I like that shit.

120
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:43,941
Anyway,

121
00:04:45,073 --> 00:04:47,159
if you don't have the high
that I have right now,

122
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,318
see this is a key moment.

123
00:04:48,318 --> 00:04:50,455
This is why, that's all fun
and I give you some context

124
00:04:50,455 --> 00:04:52,363
but here's the real punchline.

125
00:04:52,363 --> 00:04:55,563
If you don't love it, for the loving it,

126
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:57,965
and it's about the money, you've lost.

127
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,418
- Yeah, the highs have to be high.

128
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:01,251
Period.

129
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:02,084
- Like you know?

130
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:05,505
Like, like, none of this is
smart for me financially.

131
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,168
- Not for me either.

132
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:09,054
- It's just not.

133
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:09,887
But,

134
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:15,188
it's just the game man.

135
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:16,173
And you know what else?

136
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:17,006
Providing value.

137
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:18,880
Like, what was really
interesting with WineLibrary,

138
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,879
VaynerMedia and now VaynerSports,

139
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,227
is I know that I'm making
the customer happier.

140
00:05:25,227 --> 00:05:26,964
It's like that Amazon effect, right?

141
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:29,029
Jeff, I'm sure, knew he
was gonna build a monster

142
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,881
but he also knew he was making
it better for the customer.

143
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:35,221
Like I changed the premium
price points of wine in America.

144
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:36,934
Like they all came down.

145
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:39,694
Like, we put pressure on people

146
00:05:39,694 --> 00:05:41,830
doing better digital marketing

147
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,693
if they didn't want to
lose their business.

148
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:46,487
And now in sports, we're
gonna force agencies

149
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:48,848
to do a lot more for
their athletes because

150
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,930
when they can point to VaynerSports,

151
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,418
they're gonna be like,

152
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,456
- Yup.

153
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:55,761
It's not where it was,
it's where it's going

154
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:56,731
and it's changing.

155
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,691
- Everybody's trading on the past.

156
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:00,524
- Yup.

157
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:02,132
And they don't wanna let go either.

158
00:06:02,132 --> 00:06:02,965
- Why?

159
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:03,798
You're winning.

160
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:05,798
- They're gonna have to.

161
00:06:07,425 --> 00:06:08,842
- Love this part.

162
00:06:10,616 --> 00:06:12,106
Best part is I'm documenting this time.

163
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:14,372
Wish I had this the last two times.

164
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:15,539
- Imagine VaynerMedia's early days.

165
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,849
- Imagine our ghetto ass
piece of shit first office

166
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:19,996
in Buddy Media's conference
room, our sun shined suites

167
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:21,903
and we're just like, "We're gonna do it."

168
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:22,736
- Yup.

169
00:06:22,736 --> 00:06:23,569
- You guys don't know.

170
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:28,357
Our bathroom at VaynerMedia's
better than our first office.

171
00:06:28,357 --> 00:06:29,647
- That's true.

172
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:31,388
(laughing)

173
00:06:31,388 --> 00:06:32,971
Bigger and cleaner.

174
00:06:34,856 --> 00:06:38,206
- So in wrapping it up, you gotta love it.

175
00:06:38,206 --> 00:06:39,866
And most of you don't.

176
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:40,949
You're trying to figure out the money,

177
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:42,187
you're chasing the most current thing.

178
00:06:42,187 --> 00:06:45,479
Do you love cryptocurrency or
do you think it's a goldmine?

179
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,843
And that's great, I mean if
you're about it but like,

180
00:06:47,843 --> 00:06:48,989
to really go all time.

181
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:51,357
Not to become rich.

182
00:06:51,357 --> 00:06:53,595
Do you like love it or do you think like,

183
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:55,049
you gotta love it.

184
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:56,322
It's so much better.

185
00:06:56,322 --> 00:06:57,172
It's such a better way.

186
00:06:57,172 --> 00:06:59,187
Not that crypto, cryptocurrency's
gonna win but like,

187
00:06:59,187 --> 00:07:01,463
you know like, it's so
much better to love it.

188
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,992
- And some people love cryptocurrency.

189
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:03,825
- Yeah love it.

190
00:07:03,825 --> 00:07:04,951
They love math, they love it.

191
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:05,784
You know like I get it.

192
00:07:05,784 --> 00:07:06,617
I get it.

193
00:07:06,617 --> 00:07:07,450
I get it.

194
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,283
100%.

195
00:07:08,283 --> 00:07:10,311
- Just thinking about putting
pressure on industries.

196
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:11,734
- 100%.

197
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:12,567
Just love it though.

198
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:15,558
Love it for like, love it
like you can't wait to wake up

199
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:16,777
and do it.

200
00:07:16,777 --> 00:07:20,006
It's so fuckin' cliche but
because I'm in the moment

201
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,526
right this second and
you guys have seen it

202
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:23,540
on my social over the last seven days,

203
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,612
when I'm hot like that, I've
talked about VaynerSports

204
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,555
more in the last seven days
on social I did 'em first.

205
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:30,246
I'm also a funny guy that way.

206
00:07:30,246 --> 00:07:31,637
I don't, you know like--

207
00:07:31,637 --> 00:07:32,696
- You wanna get to a certain point.

208
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:33,689
- Yeah, you know how you have a kid

209
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:35,881
and you're like that not
that into it the first year

210
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:38,131
because it's cute but like,

211
00:07:39,454 --> 00:07:41,713
but then it gets really
good, you know like,

212
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:42,676
I'm a little bit like that

213
00:07:42,676 --> 00:07:45,452
with the first year of a company too.

214
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:48,058
I'm also like a shark.

215
00:07:48,058 --> 00:07:50,451
Oh wait a minute, is that a
drop of blood in the water?

216
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:52,671
I can see it and now
everybody's in trouble.

217
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:53,504
Like at first you know--

218
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:56,145
- You need context, figuring it out.

219
00:07:56,145 --> 00:07:57,727
- Now there's fuckin' blood.

220
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,963
Now there's fuckin' blood baby.

221
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:01,380
I feel bad.

222
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,683
I feel fucking bad.

223
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:09,789
Can't wait to recall this
fuckin' clip in four years.

224
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:17,863
It's game time.

225
00:08:18,983 --> 00:08:21,060
It's game time.

226
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,062
This is where Babin stops filming.

227
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:24,895
Well, you could film a little bit.

228
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:37,195
So look, I'm on?

229
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:38,028
- Yeah.

230
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:39,443
- So look, it was unbelievable.

231
00:08:39,443 --> 00:08:41,940
Like we couldn't share
anything with you but, Babin,

232
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,054
actually I'm gonna interview you.

233
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:45,168
Like, the talk you just heard.

234
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:46,600
Like what's running through your mind?

235
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,850
You know it's funny, even my own brother,

236
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,670
they're not in a room
with me a lot these days.

237
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,835
- Yeah.

238
00:08:50,835 --> 00:08:52,991
What are you taking away
from the way we postgamed

239
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,482
off this big meeting?

240
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:55,947
- Pretty unbelievable.

241
00:08:55,947 --> 00:08:59,404
Just seeing how quickly
you put in place just,

242
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:03,774
for VaynerSports to be the
most insane thing in the world.

243
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:05,965
- And if it doesn't happen
tonight, I like it even,

244
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:07,284
you guys don't understand.

245
00:09:07,284 --> 00:09:08,414
You do not understand.

246
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:11,554
If I lose tonight, it's even better.

247
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:15,137
How do you fuckin' beat
somebody like that?

248
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:20,910
How do you beat somebody like me?

249
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,006
How do you beat somebody like me?

250
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:24,269
You don't.

251
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:28,080
I created framework that
doesn't let you beat me.

252
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,163
If I win, I win and if I lose, I win.

253
00:09:32,012 --> 00:09:33,373
Actually you're filming right now right?

254
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,206
- Yeah it's still recording.

255
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,123
- Let's please, please,

256
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:38,884
- Thank you brother.

257
00:09:38,884 --> 00:09:39,717
- Nice to meet you man.

258
00:09:39,717 --> 00:09:40,550
- Nice to meet you.

259
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,383
Yes sir.

260
00:09:41,383 --> 00:09:42,216
- So crazy.

261
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:43,049
- Nice to meet you man, what's your name?

262
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:43,882
- Herman.

263
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:44,715
- Herman, thanks for saying wassup man.

264
00:09:44,715 --> 00:09:45,872
- Nice to meet you man.

265
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:46,705
- I was just like,

266
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:47,538
- You were just driving?

267
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:48,605
And just jumped out?

268
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:49,438
- Yeah.

269
00:09:49,438 --> 00:09:50,271
- I love the hustle man.

270
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:51,104
Do your thing, good luck.

271
00:09:51,104 --> 00:09:51,941
- Thank you.

272
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:53,102
- Thanks for saying wassup.

273
00:09:53,102 --> 00:09:54,852
How do you beat this?

274
00:09:59,084 --> 00:09:59,990
Justin.

275
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,073
For the vlog.

276
00:10:03,198 --> 00:10:05,223
That pizza dude knows who I am.

277
00:10:05,223 --> 00:10:06,170
(chuckling)

278
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,003
For the vlog.

279
00:10:07,003 --> 00:10:07,836
- Yeah.

280
00:10:08,756 --> 00:10:10,594
- This was the first
time you really saw me

281
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:12,483
in an environment like that.

282
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:13,716
What do you have to say
to the Vayner Nation

283
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:14,566
about what you saw?

284
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:16,116
Don't stroke it.

285
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,306
Just like shoot it straight
as if I wasn't here.

286
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:20,960
Which I know isn't possible but still try.

287
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,234
- It was like a whirlwind, literally.

288
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:24,139
Like you were in a vortex.

289
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:25,097
We talked about it.

290
00:10:25,097 --> 00:10:26,316
It was the Gary Show.

291
00:10:26,316 --> 00:10:28,146
It was full Gary Show.

292
00:10:28,146 --> 00:10:29,547
And it was like time lapsed.

293
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:31,373
When we left the meeting,
people were like,

294
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:33,429
"Shit, that was like a
movie I was just in."

295
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:34,762
And it was wild.

296
00:10:35,838 --> 00:10:37,633
Win, lose or draw, it was bomb as hell.

297
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:39,001
- Now I weirdly wanna lose
'cause I wanna be able

298
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:41,028
to recall this moment and just be like,

299
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:42,328
'cause that's the game.

300
00:10:42,328 --> 00:10:45,312
If you don't love, if
you do not love losing,

301
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,729
you fuckin' lost.

302
00:10:50,677 --> 00:10:54,405
By the way, loving
losing is hating to lose.

303
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:56,627
Let me clarify this 'cause
everyone's confused by this.

304
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:59,258
Loving to love is hating to lose

305
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,283
but respecting the game you play

306
00:11:01,283 --> 00:11:05,931
and understanding that's
part of the fuckin' equation.

307
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,920
You're doing things differently.

308
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,849
And so it's like, you know?

309
00:11:09,849 --> 00:11:12,607
I'm empathetic, and
what makes me palpable,

310
00:11:12,607 --> 00:11:13,908
is I get it.

311
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:17,202
Like I understand, but I
knew what had to be done.

312
00:11:17,202 --> 00:11:19,634
Listen, what do you think I'm good at?

313
00:11:19,634 --> 00:11:21,226
Why do you think this is
such a good business for me?

314
00:11:21,226 --> 00:11:23,091
This is the people business.

315
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:23,924
- Exactly.

316
00:11:23,924 --> 00:11:26,150
- You know who's the
all time people person?

317
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,252
Me, period.

318
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:29,083
That's what I will go down as.

319
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,911
I like people, I'm a good guy.

320
00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:32,815
- It's the people business.

321
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:35,040
- I'm a fuckin', I'm the biggest shark

322
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,171
and the biggest fuckin'
like good guy, period.

323
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:39,591
And that's facts.

324
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:40,424
- That's not wrong.

325
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:41,402
It's a people business.

326
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:42,235
- You understand?

327
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,753
- Yeah.

328
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:47,610
- People don't believe that
I'm this nice of a guy.

329
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,927
You know what I mean?

330
00:11:48,927 --> 00:11:51,044
People don't know who I am.

331
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,897
Babin, nobody knows you better than me.

332
00:11:53,897 --> 00:11:56,448
Even better in a weird way than like,

333
00:11:56,448 --> 00:12:00,284
I'm so much better of a
guy than anybody could,

334
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:03,269
even my biggest fan thinks, right?

335
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:04,905
'Cause he sees the secrets.

336
00:12:04,905 --> 00:12:07,793
He sees the way I fire people,
how I take care of people,

337
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,126
what I do.

338
00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:12,636
- [Babin] That, the like firing someone,

339
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:14,921
and then doing everything
you can to help that person

340
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:17,421
was the biggest unlock for me.

341
00:12:18,386 --> 00:12:21,138
Like the way I saw you
treat a handful of people.

342
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:25,221
- Or the way I treat The
Rock versus The Schmock.

343
00:12:26,271 --> 00:12:29,104
("Ballin" by 3VM)

344
00:12:34,035 --> 00:12:37,135
- [Gary] Everybody's
got different journeys.

345
00:12:37,135 --> 00:12:39,543
Kurt Warner's going in the Hall of Fame.

346
00:12:39,543 --> 00:12:42,710
The guy was bagging fuckin' groceries.

347
00:12:45,117 --> 00:12:47,645
That piece of shit in New
England who I hate more than life

348
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:50,312
went in the sixth fuckin' round.

349
00:12:51,308 --> 00:12:53,242
New England's not special, they got lucky.

350
00:12:53,242 --> 00:12:54,242
That's luck.

351
00:12:55,203 --> 00:12:57,658
Like don't tell me, if you knew something,

352
00:12:57,658 --> 00:13:00,666
you woulda taken him a lot earlier.

353
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,469
- [Man] Taken in the sixth round.

354
00:13:03,469 --> 00:13:05,178
- [Gary] You know?

355
00:13:05,178 --> 00:13:06,901
Just never know.

356
00:13:06,901 --> 00:13:08,973
Kurt Warner would've never had his career

357
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:11,282
if Trent Green didn't get
hurt in the preseason.

358
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:14,044
Just woulda never happened.

359
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,880
There's just too much.

360
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,371
There's just too much.

361
00:13:17,371 --> 00:13:19,024
That was tremendous.

362
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:19,962
Just like an early moment,

363
00:13:19,962 --> 00:13:22,245
getting four of our
guys together for dinner

364
00:13:22,245 --> 00:13:24,208
who happen to be out here training.

365
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,380
Just enjoyed it, been an incredible day.

366
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,318
VaynerSports is off and rockin'.

367
00:13:27,318 --> 00:13:29,652
This is the VaynerSports episode.

368
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:31,895
I've said my piece.

369
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,672
I wish these videos
existed for VaynerMedia.

370
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:37,594
I wish even more they
existed for WineLibrary.

371
00:13:37,594 --> 00:13:39,035
But here's the good part Babin.

372
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:41,895
They exist for VaynerSports.

373
00:13:41,895 --> 00:13:43,422
Actually.

374
00:13:43,422 --> 00:00:00,000
(hip-hop music)
