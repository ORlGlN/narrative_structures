mentality winner's mentality is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adam who</font>

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,079
is completely over indexed on asking

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,420
over and over and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get on the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">show big props to you brother they</font>

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,039
answer your question life is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

24
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,530
whether it's for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter showing you ads</font>

25
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,809
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook which is set this up for</font>

26
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">Twitter because they're following that</font>

27
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,850
notion of discovery whether it's dating

28
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,100
the most attractive<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy or girl you've</font>

29
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,229
ever dated before but they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

30
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:06,360
aren't that nice of a person and you

31
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,860
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't like them that much</font>

32
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,570
this is more of a guy thing from<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I</font>

33
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,310
can tell for my girlfriends but like

34
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,010
that notion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that same psychology plays</font>

35
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,930
out on this answer which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the world is</font>

36
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,540
predicated on the value<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's providing</font>

37
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,030
you versus what it's doing to otherwise

38
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,100
meaning what without a dog if you're

39
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,189
listening that was not a dog<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah from</font>

40
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,960
what we could tell my friends it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,600
simple it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the value proposition it's a</font>

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,570
seesaw does it kill Twitter it kills

43
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,979
Twitter for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that don't value</font>

44
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything else that Twitter does and</font>

45
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,640
find seven to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 more tweets in their</font>

46
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,600
stream not valuable enough right when

47
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,159
when you're a young guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you get that</font>

48
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,509
hottest girl that you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever dated</font>

49
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,000
she's so pretty you don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">that she's like hurting your feelings</font>

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,869
and mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your friends and not letting</font>

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:56,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">you hang out with your friends and all</font>

53
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:58,200
you let<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all go because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you value</font>

54
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,560
the beauty over that and as you evolve

55
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,680
eventually if she's the worst you can

56
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally after the beauty subsides and</font>

57
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,449
you've calibrated the beauty you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go the</font>

58
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,889
other way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's just the way it is</font>

59
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,640
about life you love<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

60
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,650
family so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much that you let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them get</font>

61
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,780
away with so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much that's the bottom line</font>

62
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook has enough value in keeping up</font>

63
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,160
with your friends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a lot of data</font>

64
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,630
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> show you the stuff that you actually</font>

65
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,190
want to see and that's why we're

66
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,600
tolerating it and you can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> me the</font>

67
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,160
kids are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going off of it and they're on</font>

68
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,569
snapchat Instagram and so are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

69
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:30,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's fine that makes sense but</font>

70
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,920
Facebook's data shows the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world it's</font>

71
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">true there were still on it at enough</font>

72
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,910
scale if Twitter's unable to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

73
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,890
any other product in the world tumblr

74
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,930
was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> valuable to high school kids it</font>

75
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,340
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different creative place they</font>

76
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,050
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the shift to mobile fast</font>

77
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,090
enough and good enough and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost her</font>

78
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,560
value proposition when something else

79
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,510
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> along what happens when the pretty</font>

80
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,489
girl with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome attitude comes</font>

81
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:53,320
along and so the answer to this question

82
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you can see I've used human kind of</font>

83
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,040
like what we all grew up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with kind of</font>

84
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,739
psychology is very simple which is it's

85
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:01,810
all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the value prop right the</font>

86
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,550
second this show doesn't bring you

87
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough value you stop watching period</font>

88
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,739
end of story and that's what it's all

89
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:10,360
about and so twitter has a challenge of

90
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,070
making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> its product brings enough</font>

91
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,200
value that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> little things that maybe</font>

92
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,720
don't bring you value still don't offset

93
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,049
the value oh crap wait subscribe I need

94
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:25,630
subscriptions because I can't push this

95
00:03:25,630 --> 00:00:00,000
many right hooks in social so subscribe
