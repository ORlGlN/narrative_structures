00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,430
engaging with them responding<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them</font>

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,820
disproportionate advantage to be an

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,920
early influence or personality on one of

46
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,680
these platforms that you can miss eight

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,500
times in a row<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that ninth one will</font>
