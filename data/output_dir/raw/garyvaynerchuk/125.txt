1
00:00:00,225 --> 00:00:01,604
- This shit's binary,
either you're a good person

2
00:00:01,604 --> 00:00:03,116
or you're a bad person,
either you got talent

3
00:00:03,116 --> 00:00:04,203
or you don't.

4
00:00:04,203 --> 00:00:05,246
If you're a good person and you got talent

5
00:00:05,246 --> 00:00:06,819
you win.

6
00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:09,157
If you're the other part, you lost.

7
00:00:09,157 --> 00:00:11,824
(intense music)

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,826
I'm in L.A. making some shit happen today.

9
00:00:18,826 --> 00:00:21,336
Headed to the airport in a little bit.

10
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:23,459
And headed to Australia,
I'm giving four talks

11
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:27,001
in three days and, being
back in New York by Friday.

12
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:30,853
So, fucking, I'm grinding
man, fucking working out here.

13
00:00:30,853 --> 00:00:34,353
(gentle piano music)
Bye.

14
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,303
Dude, I'm like a totally
different man right now.

15
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,679
Vlog, morning, I don't know,

16
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,204
you know what actually,
dude please chop up

17
00:00:42,204 --> 00:00:43,991
like the three or four highlights in here.

18
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:45,008
What's going on my phone?

19
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:46,628
Faster. Maybe the cloud.

20
00:00:46,628 --> 00:00:48,324
Dude it's running totally different.

21
00:00:48,324 --> 00:00:49,519
I'm pumped.
(deep breath)

22
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:51,772
There's nothing like your
phone working properly.

23
00:00:51,772 --> 00:00:53,946
I thought the X was like a piece of shit.

24
00:00:53,946 --> 00:00:54,871
- [Filmer] Dude.

25
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:56,147
- Can you throw that phone on the ground.

26
00:00:56,147 --> 00:00:58,334
But something got fucked up with my,

27
00:00:58,334 --> 00:01:02,367
my iCloud backup and like,
playing with it right now,

28
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:04,477
compared to the last 24 hours is like,

29
00:01:04,477 --> 00:01:05,892
or 36 hours is incredible.

30
00:01:05,892 --> 00:01:08,059
I just feel so happy. Yay.

31
00:01:09,842 --> 00:01:11,768
Ten minutes late for a
meeting. I hate that feeling.

32
00:01:11,768 --> 00:01:12,601
Fuck.

33
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:17,338
(hip hop music)

34
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:28,522
Hey Babin, you didn't
pick a winner for the,

35
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:32,688
- I went through some people
but I didn't find anyone.

36
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:33,521
Yeah.

37
00:01:36,798 --> 00:01:39,905
- Vlog, you just witnessed a
very exciting moment for me.

38
00:01:39,905 --> 00:01:42,723
Babin's been getting the huge benefit of

39
00:01:42,723 --> 00:01:45,297
you know, the anti D-Rock propaganda

40
00:01:45,297 --> 00:01:46,979
that I'm so passionate about.

41
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,173
But we just witnessed
the first moment where

42
00:01:49,173 --> 00:01:50,915
he's substantially dropped the ball,

43
00:01:50,915 --> 00:01:52,194
and came up with an excuse.

44
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:54,293
Tyler's struggled with this at times,

45
00:01:54,293 --> 00:01:55,492
but he's been a lot better now.

46
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:57,029
He just owns it.

47
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:58,958
But we just watched Babin try to

48
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,351
come up with some horse shit excuse.

49
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:03,107
And I'm, I'm enjoying this because

50
00:02:03,107 --> 00:02:03,940
it was a really fun moment.

51
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,121
I hope he edits this and
shows the whole thing

52
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:08,810
from where I ask him,
I hope he recalls it,

53
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,862
I don't know if he was filming yesterday

54
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:11,680
when I asked him to actually do it.

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,822
As some of you know I
did a caption contest

56
00:02:13,822 --> 00:02:14,655
to pick a winner.

57
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:16,151
I asked Babin 'cause he
had, oh I don't know,

58
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:18,667
ungodly amounts of down time yesterday,

59
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,969
to help me scale the execution.

60
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:23,739
He did not. Dropped
the ball. Solid fumble.

61
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:25,338
When I asked him about it right now,

62
00:02:25,338 --> 00:02:26,860
he had a funny little face.

63
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,190
I wish I had a camera on him,

64
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,701
thought for a second
of where he should go.

65
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:32,979
He went down the excuse tunnel,

66
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:35,125
which is the tunnel for losers.

67
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,210
So, we're gonna make this
little video right now,

68
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,489
and this is gonna help a lot of you

69
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,186
and it's gonna help Babin.

70
00:02:40,186 --> 00:02:42,085
We're not gonna let that fly.

71
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:45,197
We're gonna call him out on
it publicly, to all of you.

72
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:46,331
We're gonna move on our merry way

73
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:48,891
and you know, it's been addressed,

74
00:02:48,891 --> 00:02:51,898
and, it's an L, it's a micro loss,

75
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:53,252
but on a macro he's a great kid

76
00:02:53,252 --> 00:02:54,085
and he's doing great work.

77
00:02:54,085 --> 00:02:56,253
And having fun if we can address it today,

78
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:59,252
and we'll move on and
next time he might just,

79
00:02:59,252 --> 00:03:00,332
you know Tyler I've watched now

80
00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:01,597
and be like, no that's on me.

81
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:03,954
At first you liked to do
the excuses too Tyler.

82
00:03:03,954 --> 00:03:06,109
That shit probably played
with AJ a little bit.

83
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:09,407
But, you know, we've now kind of gotten,

84
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:12,403
you're good now at being
like that's my L, right?

85
00:03:12,403 --> 00:03:14,207
- Yep. And I've learned.

86
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:17,195
- And, and maybe you can encourage
Babin a little bit later.

87
00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:20,012
- He, picked it up pretty quick.

88
00:03:20,012 --> 00:03:21,415
- Well he still hasn't picked it up, like,

89
00:03:21,415 --> 00:03:22,902
- But,
- We're forcing him

90
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:27,069
into it right now, we'll,
we'll see if he picks it up.

91
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:32,739
(laughter)

92
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:36,560
Yo, it's a midday update.

93
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,524
Babin hasn't done much,
but I on the other hand

94
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:41,572
has completely crushed a bunch
of inner sports meetings,

95
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:43,484
bunch of client meetings for Vayner Media,

96
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:44,619
been focused as fuck.

97
00:03:44,619 --> 00:03:46,824
Nothing super glamorous. No keynotes.

98
00:03:46,824 --> 00:03:48,534
No fucking selfies on the street.

99
00:03:48,534 --> 00:03:51,489
Just fucking CEO life, trying to get it.

100
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:54,262
(groovy music)

101
00:03:54,262 --> 00:03:55,749
I've left money on the
table my whole life.

102
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:56,968
- Yeah.

103
00:03:56,968 --> 00:03:59,551
(groovy music)

104
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:05,649
- Just heading into another
meeting here in Hollywood.

105
00:04:05,649 --> 00:04:07,649
Hollywood keeps calling.

106
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,126
And I'm not answering.

107
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,243
(laughter)
So good right?

108
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:17,494
(groovy music)

109
00:04:17,494 --> 00:04:19,149
Just had a meeting with Jimmy Iovine.

110
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,510
And here's what he had to say.

111
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,117
I'm sorry I have to do it to you.

112
00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:23,468
- The only reason why
I'm doing this is because

113
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:25,045
I may be able to do
this with my headphones.

114
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:26,286
- I love it.

115
00:04:26,286 --> 00:04:27,720
Just one, I mean look,
- Yes.

116
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,200
- You're a fucking legend to every

117
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,033
single fucking kid watching this.

118
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:30,866
- Mhm.

119
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:33,187
- What core belief of what allows them

120
00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:34,856
to get to where they wanna be?

121
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:38,203
- Be willing to work
harder than the next guy.

122
00:04:38,203 --> 00:04:40,405
Take a next person.

123
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,437
Take more pain than the next
person and just don't stop.

124
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:45,724
- Eat shit.
- And don't quit.

125
00:04:45,724 --> 00:04:47,715
That's it, and if you're not doing that,

126
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:50,036
you're gonna finish second or third.

127
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:51,373
- Legend life.

128
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:53,262
- Picture?
- Yes of course.

129
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:55,908
- I'm from the Philippines
and I saw your Vlog with Will.

130
00:04:55,908 --> 00:04:56,948
- Renee, nice to meet you.

131
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:58,168
- Thank you.
- Let's take a picture. Yeah.

132
00:04:58,168 --> 00:05:00,588
- She is so excited.
- Thank you so much.

133
00:05:00,588 --> 00:05:01,670
- You're welcome, nice to meet you.

134
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,647
- Oh my god, I'm so happy.

135
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:04,384
(laughter)
- Bye, nice to meet you.

136
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:08,894
- Nice to meet you.
- Take care, have fun bye bye.

137
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:10,749
- Doing a Gary, I'm taking
all the photos out here.

138
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:12,387
Nice to meet you man.
- Pleasure man.

139
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:14,150
Thanks for having me.
- Yeah, no doubt.

140
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,097
- I'm excited.
- Come on in.

141
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:17,930
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

142
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:20,510
- This is my laptop.

143
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,343
- Gary.
- Chris.

144
00:05:21,343 --> 00:05:22,176
- Big fan,
- Thank you brother.

145
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:24,044
- Nice to meet you.
- Thanks for the love.

146
00:05:24,044 --> 00:05:25,073
- What's up man? Chris. Nice to meet you.

147
00:05:25,073 --> 00:05:26,320
- The lighting, the lighting is serious.

148
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,591
You guys did it right.

149
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:30,028
Like I know what my comfort zone is,

150
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:31,146
and I'm comfortable with that.

151
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:34,295
But I also really understand
why people need to go their way

152
00:05:34,295 --> 00:05:35,928
and that's the, that's
the fucking thing man.

153
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:37,082
Like don't do it the way I'm doing it,

154
00:05:37,082 --> 00:05:39,330
but just do it your way
and don't fucking judge

155
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,536
other people's way.

156
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:41,574
- Interesting.

157
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:42,983
See I feel like I'm kind of at

158
00:05:42,983 --> 00:05:44,649
a strange crossroads in my life

159
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:45,482
where I feel like my life,

160
00:05:45,482 --> 00:05:46,981
- Because you know
you're about to explode.

161
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:49,907
- I'm, I'm, kind of.
- Long, long, long.

162
00:05:49,907 --> 00:05:53,200
Thank you, like, like I, he, listen.

163
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,927
The man's about to explode, some are gonna

164
00:05:54,927 --> 00:05:56,510
be upset about it, others gonna be pumped

165
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,875
'cause you've been there from the get.

166
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:58,956
You're about to explode.

167
00:05:58,956 --> 00:06:02,170
The singular reason I'm here,
- Here we go.

168
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,913
- Is because I'm collecting people that

169
00:06:04,913 --> 00:06:06,636
understand what the fuck is going on.

170
00:06:06,636 --> 00:06:08,668
And the list is short.
- Hmm.

171
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,788
- You understand what's, that's it.

172
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:11,740
Like I don't know what else to say,

173
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,573
that's the fucking punch line,

174
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:13,633
see ya, goodnight.

175
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:14,755
Like that's the fucking thing.

176
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:16,364
So yeah, you're at an
interesting crossroads

177
00:06:16,364 --> 00:06:18,223
'cause you're about
fucking 15 seconds away

178
00:06:18,223 --> 00:06:20,005
from shit getting really ridiculous,

179
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,138
and you're gonna be fucking
crippled by options,

180
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:23,305
and you and Mr. Long over here

181
00:06:23,305 --> 00:06:24,394
are gonna have to make some decisions,

182
00:06:24,394 --> 00:06:25,621
and the fucking variables
are gonna fucking go

183
00:06:25,621 --> 00:06:27,555
in a hundred different directions.

184
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:29,134
And you got some fucking
decisions to make.

185
00:06:29,134 --> 00:06:30,131

223
00:07:22,813 --> 00:07:23,886

00:07:23,886 --> 00:07:24,719

Which is gonna mean 0 for 2
for my film crew to Australia.

00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:47,017
There's some sort of weird jinx on that,

00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:51,480
That's his nickname.

00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,678
Great day, huge, huge,
huge, execution in L.A.
