00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,833
Going live on Facebook

00:00:01,833 --> 00:00:03,896

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,223
I feel like

8
00:00:31,223 --> 00:00:33,150
sometimes I go so macro
I don't take advantage

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:33,983
of the opportunity

10
00:00:33,983 --> 00:00:34,960
in front of me.

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,720
and kind of what we
talked about breakfast.

13
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:40,498
In the meantime,

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,590
I've now heard seven versions of your name

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,423
and I wanna

16
00:00:44,423 --> 00:00:45,780
really own this right.

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,720
- [Man] I was gonna ask the same question.

18
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:49,592
- It's Andrea.

19
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:50,425
- I'm right.

20
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,258
Told you dick.

21
00:00:51,258 --> 00:00:52,091
- [Drock] Andrea, yeah.

22
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:53,553
- You, no I said Andrea.

23
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,386
- [Drock] When?

24
00:00:54,386 --> 00:00:56,430
- This morning you said
it, you said it differently

25
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,430
and it threw me off.

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,790
You're the one that actually scared me.

27
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,320
Yup, that's exactly what we did.

28
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,100
- [Drock] He likes Andrea.

29
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,110
- But it's Andrea.

30
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,750
It's like, was Andrea the 90210 character?

31
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,620
Yes, I knew it.

32
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,156
- [Drock] Is Andrea like,
what you wanna be called?

33
00:01:17,156 --> 00:01:19,680
- Nope, stop saying it because
it's gonna get in my head.

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,513
Andrea.

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,540
I've been on point then.

36
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,850
I've been consistently,
thank you, thank you.

37
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:26,860
But you fucked me up this morning.

38
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,790
I was like, Drock's a
sensitive type of cat.

39
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,420
He might actually be right.

40
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,570
He might've like went
right to her face and said,

41
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,722
you know, so I was scared.

- [Employee] Yeah.

59
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:28,144
- How?

60
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,670
- [Justin] Also I've been
really thinking about

61
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,580
a business idea.

62
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,423
- Okay.

63
00:02:40,423 --> 00:02:43,220
- [Justin] So basically it's like,

64
00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:47,272
a type of gym environment.

65
00:02:47,272 --> 00:02:50,020
(bleep) have that environment.

66
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,320
So like a space, a space--

67
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,070
- Capital intensive.

68
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,220
The reason this is a tough business,

69
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,230
whatever comes out of your next mouth,

70
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,010
is it costs a million
dollars to even start.

71
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:01,843
- [Justin] Okay.

72
00:03:01,843 --> 00:03:03,830
- Like not really, you could do it ghetto.

73
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,370
- [Justin] What if I started ghetto?

74
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,200
- Kinda like that.

75
00:03:10,972 --> 00:03:12,060
- [Justin] This is 10 year and--

76
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,280
- Gym rats have gym equipment.

77
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,970
- [Justin] Right, I want
there to be (bleep) in it too.

78
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:17,803
- That's what I mean.

79
00:03:17,803 --> 00:03:20,140
So you know like, you can do it though.

80
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,800
You just need to know
you're on a real long path.

81
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,840
- [Justin] For sure.

82
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,673
- Which is cool.

83
00:03:24,673 --> 00:03:25,506
Like honestly, I know you.

84
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,130
Like, we're almost weirdly like that.

85
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,380
- [Justin] I'm trying
to play like, the game.

86
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,960
In so many ways like
I'm very similar to you.

87
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,950
And like, I was just thinking like,

88
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,710
and especially this past
week that I've been off,

89
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,270
I'm like, what do I really like?

90
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,250
I like music and I like doing
it the way I was doing it

91
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,210
because I was going
like the Christian route

92
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,620
which I'm Christian so like I wanted to

93
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,600
in some way be impactful.

94
00:03:50,548 --> 00:03:51,540
And so (bleep)

95
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,690
- Probably why you like my stuff right?

96
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,200
Like I'm not necessarily religious

97
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,040
but I'm like very religious.

98
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,950
- [Justin] Right, exactly.

99
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,390
Like you're helping.

100
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,223
- Yeah exactly.

101
00:03:59,223 --> 00:04:03,170
- [Justin] I like that,
that that's who you are.

102
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,200
So like, the reason why
I wanna do this (bleep),

103
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,140
I know it's like, it's gonna cost a lot

104
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,320
but like, I'd start ghetto as fuck.

105
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,400
I just wanted like advice on how to like--

106
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,750
- Where do you wanna do it?

107
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,040
- [Justin] It'd probably
be too expensive like

108
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,240
to start in Manhattan but
like, Queens, Brooklyn,

109
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
something like that.

110
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:25,080
- Dude, I'm super into it.

111
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,760
- [Justin] A franchise kind of thing.

112
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,110
Like place I have in Houston.

113
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,960
- So let me give you a great example.

114
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,290
You'd heard a lot of my advice

115
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,810
so you're gonna understand this.

116
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,490
When I hear that, I almost feel like

117
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,090
I want you to go intern for
(bleep) who start (bleep)

118
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:40,940
and runs (bleep).

119
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,753
- [Justin] Okay.

120
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:44,280
- I almost feel like I wanna pitch him

121
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,610
on the idea of doing like,

122
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,400
you doing for him what I
do, what VaynerTalent does.

123
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,920
So you could actually learn
the franchise business.

124
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,472
If you really wanna do that.

125
00:04:55,472 --> 00:04:56,305
- [Justin] Yeah.

126
00:04:56,305 --> 00:04:58,930
- If you really wanna do
that, you know how I say

127
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,350
go work for Puff Daddy or
Howard Schultz from Starbucks?

128
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,900
Well fuckin' one of the
gangster fuckin' people

129
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,740
in the game (bleep).

130
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:09,330
- [Justin] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

131
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,670
- Like one of the top
franchisee people in the game

132
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,650
is my homie.

133
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,560
- [Justin] And you think that's the best--

134
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,000
- Always I think that.

135
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,390
Brother, do you how much smarter you are

136
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,570
by just sitting in the epicenter?

137
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,825
- [Justin] Yeah, you're right.

138
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,750
I get it.

139
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,390
- Dude that's the game always.

140
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,800
You got too much time.

141
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,000
You know how hard the
franchise business is?

142
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,350
99.9% fail.

143
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,260
You don't anything about
building franchise business.

144
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,810
You know what you wanna do.

145
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,050
But you've no idea of
how to have a business.

146
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,760
If you're really talking
about Atlanta and New Orleans,

147
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,870
you make the trade.

148
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,230
Like if you followed me every day,

149
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,650
you would understand how to
run an agency much better.

150
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,230
- [Justin] Right, but I'm
thinking something different.

151
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,063
- Go ahead.

152
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:58,925
- [Justin] No I mean like,
I'm different than this.

153
00:05:58,925 --> 00:05:59,758
- Correct.

154
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:02,210
You wanna run a franchisee business.

155
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,260
Like you wanna build the
soul cycle of your thing?

156
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,240
Well then go work for
somebody who's built it

157
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,580
in a different way.

158
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,250
- [Justin] But my thing, my only concern,

159
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,627
- Go ahead.

160
00:06:14,627 --> 00:06:18,200
- [Justin] If somebody
comes up with that before me

161
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,330
'cause even if somebody
does, I can make it better

162
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,930
and it just eats that out.

163
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,100
Does that sound like cheese?

164
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,933
- Never.

165
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:26,470
It's a young concern in the same way

166
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,040
that people wanna patent things

167
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,097
but it's not what the
world is really played on.

168
00:06:31,097 --> 00:06:34,080
- [Justin] Okay (bleep)

169
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,180
- They exist already.

170
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,030
- [Justin] Right.

171
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,420
But I was meaning for like
everything like (bleep)

172
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,411
Yeah.

173
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:43,567
- You know?

174
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:45,440
That I'm not worried about at all.

175
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,490
The fact that you're
even thinking that way

176
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,630
is interesting than to get
you in front of somebody

177
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,630
who's built a business that way.

178
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,810
- [Justin] Okay.

179
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,880
- Like being a creator, this
is a master's class in it.

180
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,760
Building a brand, this
was fuckin' like Harvard.

181
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,300
Like it's happened in front of your eyes.

182
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,830
Even in the time you've been here.

183
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,680
- [Justin] Right.

184
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,560
- You don't anything about building

185
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,400
a location based business.

186
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,110
It's cool when you break it down right?

187
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,340
But you have the advantage of my cosign

188
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,290
and your craft that you
can bring to somebody

189
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,550
and again, Drock and Babin are smarter

190
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,440
about running the agency than Andy is.

191
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,740
'Cause they're in it watching.

192
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,470
So imagine watching (bleep),
you might be like fuck that

193
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,470
I'm not doing that, so we
have to go to the next person.

194
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,540
But that's always the
right move at this time.

195
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,750
You have it better than anybody

196
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,510
'cause I tell people go get
a job with P. Diddy but how?

197
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,890
You have my ability to
put you in the spot.

198
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,720
If that's what you wanna do.

199
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,449
You have to decide how, but
I could also see you lead

200
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:51,860
and I could see you leaving
here and being like (bleep),

201
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,693
know what I mean?

202
00:07:52,693 --> 00:07:53,810
- [Justin] Also it's like
your energy is different

203
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,960
than those other.

204
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,650
I don't know if I would
click as well as I know you.

205
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,160
- Yeah, yeah that's a vulnerability.

206
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,900
- [Justin] And I don't know
if you feel that same energy

207
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,056
that we click.

208
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:04,059
- I feel like we click,
I feel like we click.

209
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:05,330
- [Justin] And I don't know
if it would be the same way

210
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,370
with another person.

211
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,203
- I get it.

212
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,370
- [Justin] That's one like worry.

213
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,430
- Because you're lucky
that you got the experience

214
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,580
with the comedy thing.

215
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,470
We haven't talked about it.

216
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,130
But like, right.

217
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,037
When you get under the
hood, everybody's different.

218
00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:21,400
- [Justin] That was a positive experience.

219
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,840
- Good, the peeps.

220
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,570
- [Justin] Yeah, real good peeps.

221
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,790
- The first move is are
you willing to really

222
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,240
make this your next seven,
theoretically if it goes well,

223
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,429
are you willing to make this your next

224
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,293
three, five, seven, eight years?

225
00:08:35,294 --> 00:08:36,860
- [Justin] I'm thinking life.

226
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,693
- Great.

227
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:40,280
So if that's true, then yes
I think you should go work

228
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,159
for somebody's who built
a franchise business.

229
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,740
I think it would be
unbelievably ROI positive.

230
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,760
I would even say if you
think the guy's a douche

231
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,060
and you don't click, eat
shit and just listen.

232
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,980
- [Justin] Okay, got it, cool.

233
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,052
- You know?

234
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:55,885
Like.

235
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,310
- [Justin] Yeah you're right.

236
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,336
- If that's really what you're--

237
00:09:02,336 --> 00:09:04,170
- [Justin] I wasn't thinking
that that the was next move.

238
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,030
- I know, that's what mentors are for.

239
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,580
I know what you were looking at

240
00:09:07,619 --> 00:09:09,810
and this is what, I wish I was smarter

241
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,010
and had mentors right.

242
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,840
Mentors will help you.

243
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,390
- [Justin] I was thinking
hella short term.

244
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,600
That mind was short term
thank you, but that is like--

245
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,433
- True long term.

246
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,950
- [Justin] How you would, right.

247
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,458
- You're trading your crub.

248
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,380
You're trading, you're
cashing in on the equity

249
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,680
that I always promise
which is get in with me,

250
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,790
you trade on your skill, go and do that,

251
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,730
but you're fuckin' sitting
there and fuckin' listening.

252
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,020
Remember how much you
learned just in one day?

253
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,090
- [Justin] Yeah, you're right.

254
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,600
- You hear him talking
about square footage

255
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,920
or why that location won't
work or like demographics.

256
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,070
You'll come out of it knowing shit.

257
00:09:48,057 --> 00:09:49,800
- [Justin] Right.

258
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,620
And plus like the branding
social media side of all that,

259
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,220
like I've absorbed so much here, yeah.

260
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,070
- Way more, you don't
even realize how much.

261
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,170
Because when you get to the real world

262
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,170
and you're not playing in the majors,

263
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,580
it's like a basketball player.

264
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,560
Who only plays in the NBA.

265
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,820
And then they go play at the park

266
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,870
and they're like right, I'm really great.

267
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,880
- [Justin] Right.

268
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:13,600
- You know?

269
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,620
Just happens every time.

270
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:22,200
("The Effect" by F. Mills)

271
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:40,936
Please tell me you got that.

272
00:11:22,210 --> 00:00:00,000
- Let's go.
