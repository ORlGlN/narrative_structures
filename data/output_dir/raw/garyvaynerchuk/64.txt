1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,533
- One a.m.

2
00:00:01,533 --> 00:00:02,488
Greatest night ever.

3
00:00:02,488 --> 00:00:05,071
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:11,437
- Check, check, one, two.

5
00:00:11,437 --> 00:00:13,270
Scoo-dee-be-deep-beep.

6
00:00:14,488 --> 00:00:17,013
♪ Me and Mike Boyd in
the back seat, woo. ♪

7
00:00:17,013 --> 00:00:19,596
(upbeat music)

8
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:31,139
- Have a good day.

9
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:32,281
- Real good.

10
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:33,766
A lot of client stuff, a lot of stuff,

11
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:34,849
just fucking,

12
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:37,200
we're so busy.

13
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:40,370
Like it's just like a hyper.

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,397
You know like in a video game
where you're going real fast,

15
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:44,678
but then you have the boost
button and your like ah.

16
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:45,511
- Sonic the Hedgehog?

17
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:47,366
- That's the shit where we're on.

18
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:48,240
How are you, man?

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,073
- I'm good, man.

20
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:51,606
- What's been going on?
- Ah, chillin.

21
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:53,722
Got the Habu video,

22
00:00:53,722 --> 00:00:54,805
I don't know if you've seen it yet.

23
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:55,638
- I did, man.

24
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:56,659
I promised you I'd look at it.

25
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:58,220
I really liked it, man.

26
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,053
I thought it was fresh.

27
00:00:59,053 --> 00:01:00,863
You saw we put some joints on our,

28
00:01:00,863 --> 00:01:02,353
our playlist this week?

29
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,186
- No.

30
00:01:03,186 --> 00:01:04,888
- Do you listen to our playlist?

31
00:01:04,888 --> 00:01:05,830
- He might not know...

32
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:06,663
You know what's funny?

33
00:01:06,663 --> 00:01:09,192
We haven't really hit
it that hard just yet.

34
00:01:09,192 --> 00:01:11,536
We started something pretty cool.

35
00:01:11,536 --> 00:01:13,039
- Ah, man, that's fire.

36
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,182
- And you know what's funny?
- Hm?

37
00:01:14,182 --> 00:01:15,015
- I asked a couple people in the office

38
00:01:15,015 --> 00:01:16,259
what their favorite songs were,

39
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,367
your fucking songs.
- Ah, shit, man.

40
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:19,217
- So I start this,

41
00:01:19,217 --> 00:01:20,814
I start this playlist.
- Uh huh.

42
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,980
♪ Honestly I think that
24/7 an understatement ♪

43
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,029
♪ To my day to day ♪

44
00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:24,862
♪ If ain't no way ♪

45
00:01:24,862 --> 00:01:26,506
- This notion of--
- Thank you.

46
00:01:26,506 --> 00:01:27,339
- Thank you.

47
00:01:27,339 --> 00:01:29,819
This notion of, like, my concern

48
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:33,118
that you have a little bit
too much perfection in you.

49
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:34,047
- Yeah.

50
00:01:34,047 --> 00:01:34,880
- What do you think?

51
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,207
Like on some friend shit,
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

52
00:01:37,207 --> 00:01:39,447
- I really think it's a big deal, man.

53
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:41,803
I really wish I could convince you

54
00:01:41,803 --> 00:01:43,106
but, like, look you're an artist.

55
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:45,030
So, like, I'm not trying to convince,

56
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,021
but I think it's a healthy conversation.

57
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:49,062
Like I think I'll
probably drill it into you

58
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:51,968
every time we know each other
for the rest of our lives.

59
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:54,385
I don't think artists reali--

60
00:01:55,924 --> 00:01:58,473
Like, I'm so good at one thing.

61
00:01:58,473 --> 00:02:00,327
Which is like the reality of attention

62
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:03,206
and how shit happens, that's all I got.

63
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,177
It's disproportionately--

64
00:02:05,177 --> 00:02:08,844
like, the shit that I
believe on this issue.

65
00:02:09,821 --> 00:02:10,996
Fuck, man.

66
00:02:10,996 --> 00:02:12,884
- I mean, I be learning something

67
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:16,294
just through like watching
everything you've been doing

68
00:02:16,294 --> 00:02:18,928
since, you know, we--
- Since we connected.

69
00:02:18,928 --> 00:02:19,761
- And stuff like that.

70
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:21,379
And, like, I'm definitely like--

71
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:22,729
- If you're more open-minded to it

72
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:23,562
than you were before.

73
00:02:23,562 --> 00:02:25,099
Yeah, and it's a process.

74
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:27,631
Do you consume music?
- Yeah.

75
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:28,504
And you're like,

76
00:02:28,504 --> 00:02:30,209
like who do you listen to right now?

77
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:32,233
- Like a lot of alternative
and borrowed stuff.

78
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:33,998
So like Hiatus Coyote and--

79
00:02:33,998 --> 00:02:34,934
- You need to collab--

80
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:37,068
you need to literally DM them

81
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:38,863
and be like, yo we should work together.

82
00:02:38,863 --> 00:02:39,908
- Yeah.
- No, no,

83
00:02:39,908 --> 00:02:44,234
I mean every time anybody
puts out a joint that you like

84
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:47,554
because my theory is that is
some like fucking country star

85
00:02:47,554 --> 00:02:49,659
or some up and coming
rapper that Boyd puts you on

86
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:51,892
or some, whatever, alternative.

87
00:02:51,892 --> 00:02:53,403
Or some fucking Bangladeshi kid

88
00:02:53,403 --> 00:02:56,213
that you think did some fly shit.

89
00:02:56,213 --> 00:02:57,728
The reason I say that is my hope

90
00:02:57,728 --> 00:02:59,159
is that like one out of every ten's like,

91
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,132
yo what's up, let's do
it, I'm coming through.

92
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:02,939
Let's go in studio.

93
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:04,838
People need to put out music, man.

94
00:03:04,838 --> 00:03:07,509
So, Boyd, what's going on?

95
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:09,730
- What's going on?

96
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,777
He was saying he'd like to go to Atlanta

97
00:03:11,777 --> 00:03:14,276
and see the studio culture there.

98
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:15,813
He told me that he only records

99
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:17,641
when it's time for an album.

100
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:19,009
I was like I've never even,

101
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:19,917
I've never seen that, man.

102
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:21,123
(laughs)

103
00:03:21,123 --> 00:03:22,914
Cause in Atlanta you know everyone.

104
00:03:22,914 --> 00:03:24,843
Here's Atlanta:

105
00:03:24,843 --> 00:03:27,604
Monday through Sunday, studio.

106
00:03:27,604 --> 00:03:28,994
Doesn't matter, you know what I mean?

107
00:03:28,994 --> 00:03:29,862
It doesn't matter if your album...

108
00:03:29,862 --> 00:03:31,208
Like Jeezy, his album drops Friday.

109
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,084
You know what he's doing
when he gets back to Atlanta?

110
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:33,917
Studio.

111
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,653
That's just like a way of life, you know?

112
00:03:36,653 --> 00:03:37,486
- Mmhmm.

113
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:40,014
- And you know what
Richie's doing right now?

114
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:42,198
He's with Future in the studio.

115
00:03:42,198 --> 00:03:43,072
Every day.
- For years, like,

116
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:43,982
I think I'm doing a lot more.

117
00:03:43,982 --> 00:03:46,621
Like, there's like shit that I wanna do

118
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:48,449
when I finish--
- You're an interesting guy

119
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:50,889
cause you're like, you're
also a little bit of like--

120
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:51,794
You just beat me to it.

121
00:03:51,794 --> 00:03:53,822
You're a little bit of
like a holistic artist.

122
00:03:53,822 --> 00:03:55,483
- Yeah, like, I think
I'm gonna do FoodCon.

123
00:03:55,483 --> 00:03:56,741
I think that they almost set that up

124
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:59,134
cause they're doing it in
Queens before our sales

125
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:00,975
and, like, I get to curate all the food

126
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:02,411
that is coming from Queens.

127
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:03,419
To, me, like--
- I think you're--

128
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:05,481
- It doesn't have to always be an EP--

129
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:06,314
- I also think.

130
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:08,555
I also think your food joint is real.

131
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:12,083
I'm sorry, your merchandise is real.

132
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,440
- Thank you.

133
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,490
- I think you got a good eye for that.

134
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,204
- Thank you, man.

135
00:04:17,204 --> 00:04:19,658
- Yeah, man, I think
about it the same way.

136
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:20,516
I put out a fuck...

137
00:04:20,516 --> 00:04:23,096
I put out a mix tape this week.

138
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,202
The Airplane Project.

139
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:26,785
(upbeat music)

140
00:04:28,495 --> 00:04:29,844
Man, you're a real tar--

141
00:04:29,844 --> 00:04:31,238
you're a real talented artist, man.

142
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:33,488
You need to put out music.

143
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:34,321
- I feel you.

144
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:36,428
- But you need to figure out

145
00:04:36,428 --> 00:04:39,266
the key is the normal format

146
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:41,744
isn't gonna work for you this minute

147
00:04:41,744 --> 00:04:43,514
because of the way you think about it.

148
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:44,347
- Right.

149
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:47,445
- Like, I'll give you a good example.

150
00:04:47,445 --> 00:04:50,454
- Okay.
- In business, there's shit

151
00:04:50,454 --> 00:04:54,621
that I spend months on thinking
about, putting together.

152
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:59,987
I pop it out and it
doesn't click in 24 hours

153
00:04:59,987 --> 00:05:02,366
and I know it's not gonna
be what I want it to be

154
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:04,390
and I'm literally onto the next shit.

155
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,407
And that's a whole different like mindset

156
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,728
where you're just completely deploy

157
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:12,084
the obnoxious humility of the market

158
00:05:12,084 --> 00:05:14,421
is the market is the market.
- Yeah.

159
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:16,117
- Game over.

160
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:18,419
All I know is that like
I'm very interested in

161
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,733
the collaborations of
people that you admire

162
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:21,939
or you're into it.
- Mmhmm.

163
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:23,596
- Cause I think there's something there.

164
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:27,618
What you need to do is create a system...

165
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,721
Hold this.

166
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:31,494
You need to create a system

167
00:05:31,494 --> 00:05:34,254
where you get the leverage
with the end consumer

168
00:05:34,254 --> 00:05:37,201
so those fucking guys come to you

169
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:39,765
instead of you worrying about or debating

170
00:05:39,765 --> 00:05:42,077
or being curious of what would happen if.

171
00:05:42,077 --> 00:05:43,061
Let me tell you something else

172
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:45,253
that I'm gonna really fucking
unleash you right now.

173
00:05:45,253 --> 00:05:47,157
Cause it's gonna really matter.

174
00:05:47,157 --> 00:05:48,589
Let me tell you the biggest
mistake you're making

175
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:51,128
in your mind from afar on kites.

176
00:05:51,128 --> 00:05:52,275
- Okay.

177
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:54,535
- You put it on wax.

178
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:57,305
You put real shit that
you know means something

179
00:05:57,305 --> 00:05:59,574
to your culture on wax.

180
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:02,504
What you don't realize yet

181
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:04,718
is you could say the same shit 79 times

182
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:07,521
over the next nine years in
different contexts and ways

183
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:09,354
and still pull it off.

184
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:12,393
There's nothing in the Airplane Project

185
00:06:12,393 --> 00:06:14,435
I haven't said before.

186
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:16,488
That's why DRock didn't understand it.

187
00:06:16,488 --> 00:06:18,096
Cause he's like, I know this.

188
00:06:18,096 --> 00:06:19,433
It's just a less polished version

189
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:21,728
of great shit you've said before.

190
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:23,553
That's why I understood his reaction.

191
00:06:23,553 --> 00:06:27,493
The difference was the way
I packaged the thoughts

192
00:06:27,493 --> 00:06:29,410
I knew would penetrate.

193
00:06:31,026 --> 00:06:31,859
- Absolutely.

194
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,165
- The fact that you could basically make

195
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:35,165
Cleopatra all over again

196
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,918
and call it Brown Princess in 18 months

197
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:43,598
on some, whatever the
emerging EDM fucking joint is,

198
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:45,468
that, my man, is liberating.

199
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:46,538
- I guess for me it's--

200
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:47,900
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

201
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,177
- Because I think that
fucked with me a lot.

202
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,860
Which is like, but I already talked

203
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,190
about patience in a video two years ago.

204
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,561
Until I realized, yeah
but if nobody heard it,

205
00:06:56,561 --> 00:06:57,433
nobody heard it.

206
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:58,793
Sometimes it's the fourth project

207
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,710
of the same exact shit.

208
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,728
There's so much you could do, man.

209
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:07,448
- Nah, man, I--
- You could do so much.

210
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:08,281
- Yeah.
- You could do

211
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:09,706
so much powerful shit.

212
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:11,334
Look what happened yesterday.

213
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:12,983
You could social commentate on that.

214
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:14,858
- Yeah.
- From a different perspective

215
00:07:14,858 --> 00:07:17,253
that might just be the moment.
- Mmhmm.

216
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:19,435
- You could or you may
decide to let it pass.

217
00:07:19,435 --> 00:07:20,377
That's all cool.

218
00:07:20,377 --> 00:07:22,022
Tomorrow you may fall in love, like,

219
00:07:22,022 --> 00:07:23,567
there's just so much.

220
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:24,483
I don't know.

221
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:27,503
- Yeah, there's so many
ideas I have that are like--

222
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:28,336
- That's what...

223
00:07:28,336 --> 00:07:30,361
Honestly, when I hear that.

224
00:07:30,361 --> 00:07:32,671
That's where the shit
stops and ends for me.

225
00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:34,232
- Yeah.
- Of course.

226
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:37,241
If you have ideas, you need
to figure out a process

227
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:40,817
to get em to fucking
see the world otherwise.

228
00:07:40,817 --> 00:07:42,318
I literally think the
hundred greatest songs

229
00:07:42,318 --> 00:07:45,134
of all time never happened.

230
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:47,757
They just passed from John Lennon's head.

231
00:07:47,757 --> 00:07:48,637
Like, right?

232
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:51,057
Michael Jackson just didn't put it on wax.

233
00:07:51,057 --> 00:07:52,557
Dude, the biz dev?

234
00:07:53,464 --> 00:07:57,014
The distribution is more
or equally important

235
00:07:57,014 --> 00:07:58,989
to the actual song when people think...

236
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:00,542
People think they're
gonna make a hot joint

237
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:03,074
and somehow miraculously
RapCaviar is gonna pick it up,

238
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:05,672
everybody's gonna see it and away it goes.

239
00:08:05,672 --> 00:08:06,913
What is your...

240
00:08:06,913 --> 00:08:09,139
Step back now that we got a few minutes,

241
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:11,795
how do you think about songs?

242
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:13,996
What are your seven or
80, like how do you...?

243
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:15,022
What's your process?

244
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:17,144
- I'm not like a rapper's rapper, right?

245
00:08:17,144 --> 00:08:19,734
So it's not a two track
and just get in the studio

246
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:22,057
and make a new song like Atlanta does.

247
00:08:22,057 --> 00:08:24,705
They knock out like four,
five, six songs like that.

248
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:27,402
And also, that doesn't
necessarily interest me.

249
00:08:27,402 --> 00:08:28,235
- Good.

250
00:08:28,235 --> 00:08:30,187
- And I don't like doing shit
that doesn't interest me.

251
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:31,344
- You shouldn't.

252
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,549
- Cause I'm good at it, right?

253
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,382
Like I could do a...

254
00:08:33,383 --> 00:08:36,726
I could make a blues
song tomorrow if I wanted

255
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:39,553
and I could make a power song another day,

256
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,453
which is the (hums).

257
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:43,329
The next day, if I wanted to.

258
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,089
But it doesn't necessarily mean I should.

259
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:48,288
I'm talented enough to do
all of that shit, right?

260
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:50,268
But I don't necessarily like making

261
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:53,351
like straight rap music
or things like that.

262
00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:56,048
My whole MO is making interesting music

263
00:08:56,048 --> 00:08:57,572
like using the artists that I'm into

264
00:08:57,572 --> 00:08:59,218
like Hiatus Coyote and people that I

265
00:08:59,218 --> 00:09:01,122
really, really am fond of.
- Yep.

266
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:03,281
- And for me, that takes time, right.

267
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:06,535
That's the process, that's the
ideas that I start creating

268
00:09:06,535 --> 00:09:09,681
like, you know, Tides or Cleopatra,

269
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:11,074
one of your favorite songs.

270
00:09:11,074 --> 00:09:12,399
That took time in my head.

271
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,720
I needed to produce that in my head.

272
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,692
I was like how the fuck do
I make a dance hall rhythm

273
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:18,645
and put an Indian sample on it

274
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:20,314
but it not be the lead?

275
00:09:20,314 --> 00:09:22,583
How do I do that without like...

276
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,082
If you took the sample out,
is it still a good song?

277
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:25,915
How do you do that?

278
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:28,294
Because in history of anybody
sampling Indian music,

279
00:09:28,294 --> 00:09:29,943
Indian flute, Timbaland, whatever...

280
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:31,236
You take the sample out, the song's dumb

281
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:32,488
it's just a fucking bass drum.

282
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,569
That's what it is.

283
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:36,020
And because I think
about music that deeply,

284
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,319
you know it's just not like a simple like,

285
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:40,254
oh I can make a song about cake cannoli

286
00:09:40,254 --> 00:09:41,366
cause that's what I wanna do.

287
00:09:41,366 --> 00:09:42,199
You know what I'm saying?

288
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:43,305
Because I don't think
about music like that

289
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:45,346
and it's layered--
- I understand.

290
00:09:45,346 --> 00:09:47,220
- It takes me a longer time to make.

291
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,347
Like I was listening to
Coldplay's Parachutes

292
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:51,159
this entire week and I was like,

293
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,557
oh I'm taking shit from this.

294
00:09:52,557 --> 00:09:54,054
I'm about to take like alternative shit

295
00:09:54,054 --> 00:09:55,414
and mix it with like trap drums

296
00:09:55,414 --> 00:09:59,462
and then sprinkle in like
the foreign shit that I do.

297
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:02,075
Just because for me,
that's more interesting.

298
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:04,057
I could wake up tomorrow and do a...

299
00:10:04,057 --> 00:10:04,890
- What about?

300
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,125
What about, what about...

301
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,556
What about the second
you're done hearing that

302
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:09,905
and you've decided that,

303
00:10:09,905 --> 00:10:13,217
what about whipping out your phone,

304
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:15,538
hitting the memos app

305
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:17,374
and just talking about what's
going on through your mind

306
00:10:17,374 --> 00:10:20,124
and put it out?
- Oh, that's cool.

307
00:10:21,318 --> 00:10:25,123
- What about fucking sharing the process?

308
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:27,189
- That's cool, yeah.
- Right?

309
00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:29,999
Like what about that?
- Yeah.

310
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:30,832
- That's unique.

311
00:10:30,832 --> 00:10:32,474
Like what I think...

312
00:10:32,474 --> 00:10:34,020
You know one thing
that's interesting about

313
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,747
that I'm starting to try
to understand about myself

314
00:10:35,747 --> 00:10:40,225
is like I started a longform
YouTube show in 2006.

315
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:41,058
- Yeah.

316
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,880
- Like.

317
00:10:44,105 --> 00:10:46,611
Like Google flew me out in 2006

318
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:49,000
and was like what are you doing?

319
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,833
Like I don't...

320
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,791
Like obviously I'm thinking about it a lot

321
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,791
because of the Airplane Project like

322
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:57,844
I make different shit, man.

323
00:10:57,844 --> 00:10:59,176
DailyVee's different.

324
00:10:59,176 --> 00:11:02,007
DailyVee's the start of a genre.

325
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:04,907
Like everybody vlogged
before like first person.

326
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:07,250
People didn't have a dude
fucking following them.

327
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,813
Do you know what's interesting to me?

328
00:11:09,813 --> 00:11:11,857
Is about how I think about things

329
00:11:11,857 --> 00:11:14,693
meaning, so I hear something like that.

330
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:17,381
I'm like that's so
creative, that's so right

331
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:19,118
and then I think about leverage.

332
00:11:19,118 --> 00:11:20,110
Thank you.

333
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:20,943
Right?

334
00:11:20,943 --> 00:11:22,196
I think about leverage.

335
00:11:22,196 --> 00:11:24,310
I think so much of what I do

336
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,558
is to have so much leverage

337
00:11:25,558 --> 00:11:29,918
that when I cash it in
something good happens, right?

338
00:11:29,918 --> 00:11:34,369
Like to me you're a foregone
conclusion success wise.

339
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:35,272
- To you I'm what?

340
00:11:35,272 --> 00:11:36,635
- Foregone conclusion.

341
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:38,172
You will be successful.

342
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:40,157
It's a foregone conclusion.

343
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,832
Who makes a bigger impact?

344
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:45,165
The artist that stays true the whole way

345
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:49,819
and then gets put on later in their career

346
00:11:51,032 --> 00:11:52,615
or the artist that,

347
00:11:54,273 --> 00:11:56,844
not deviates or sells out but--

348
00:11:56,844 --> 00:11:58,434
- The first one.
- Breaks out.

349
00:11:58,434 --> 00:12:00,066
- I'll cut you off right
now, the first one.

350
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:00,947
- Go ahead.
- Every single time.

351
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:03,402
When you said legacy over--

352
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:05,651
- Yeah, currency.
- Currency, that's it.

353
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:07,368
- Well, listen, here's
something interesting though.

354
00:12:07,368 --> 00:12:10,339
Let me tell you something, though.

355
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:11,749
The Beatles.
- Yeah.

356
00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:13,110
- Right?
- Yeah.

357
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,085
- Like to me, I'm fascinated
by do you gather the attention

358
00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:18,950
and then deploy it?

359
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,508
So it's funny, I--
- I feel like

360
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:22,084
only you're doing it, right?

361
00:12:22,084 --> 00:12:22,917
(background noises drown out conversation)

362
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:23,750
- Well, it's interesting.

363
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,850
I'm actually going to a weird place maybe

364
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,752
because I was at a charity
event a couple of hours ago.

365
00:12:27,752 --> 00:12:30,040
I used to think, like, ten years ago

366
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,108
that I would make a lot of money one day

367
00:12:32,108 --> 00:12:33,326
and I'd be a really good guy

368
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:36,005
and be one of those old
guys giving out money.

369
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,672
And now I just give out
money along the way.

370
00:12:41,985 --> 00:12:44,445
And then there's something about like,

371
00:12:44,445 --> 00:12:48,206
the thought of like making an impact

372
00:12:48,206 --> 00:12:50,065
that I wonder if like...

373
00:12:50,065 --> 00:12:53,483
You think about Gaga or Eminem
or things of that nature.

374
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:55,376
Look at what Eminem's doing right now.

375
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:56,209
He's making a real...

376
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,243
He has a real chance
to make a real impact.

377
00:12:58,243 --> 00:13:00,958
He's going at it right now.

378
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,994
In like a real smart way.

379
00:13:02,994 --> 00:13:03,827
And like...

380
00:13:03,827 --> 00:13:05,477
I don't know.

381
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:07,101
There's something so incredible

382
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:08,900
when you have people listening.

383
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,043
Actually, oh shit.

384
00:13:10,043 --> 00:13:11,693
- There he comes.

385
00:13:11,693 --> 00:13:13,437
- Hello.
- Hello, Hasan.

386
00:13:13,437 --> 00:13:15,297
- How's life?

387
00:13:15,297 --> 00:13:16,885
- It's good, man.

388
00:13:16,885 --> 00:13:18,092
- Loved having you on, man.

389
00:13:18,092 --> 00:13:18,925
- Dude, it was so fun.

390
00:13:18,925 --> 00:13:22,238
- People are loving it so much.

391
00:13:22,238 --> 00:13:23,571
We're getting such good feedback.

392
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:24,583
- Really?

393
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,753
I feel like the internet
is just exposing people.

394
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:30,758
- People don't wanna fucking face facts.

395
00:13:30,758 --> 00:13:32,792
People don't want to face facts, man.

396
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:35,448
We're getting exposed at scale.

397
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,498
People blaming social
media, it's laughable.

398
00:13:37,498 --> 00:13:39,147
- Dude, I think this is bad, though.

399
00:13:39,147 --> 00:13:39,980
I mean, this is ...

400
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,525
A lot of this is not.

401
00:13:41,525 --> 00:13:43,205
- So what's better?

402
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:45,849
- I would say the same--
- Hiding?

403
00:13:45,849 --> 00:13:47,317
- No, I would just...

404
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:48,997
No, no, no, no.
- I know we're talking.

405
00:13:48,997 --> 00:13:50,073
- I would just say let's like,

406
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:50,906
let's strike the balance.

407
00:13:50,906 --> 00:13:51,739
I'll say for me.
- I don't know,

408
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:54,167
you're the only one that felt that way.

409
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,553
- I'll give you a prime
example right here.

410
00:13:55,553 --> 00:13:59,091
We're having, we're all
chopping it up having dinner.

411
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:03,005
Like the biggest thing
for me and just like you,

412
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:05,672
you have to make really,
really big important decisions

413
00:14:05,672 --> 00:14:06,836
and all that stuff.

414
00:14:06,836 --> 00:14:09,501
And so one of the things that I try to do

415
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:11,861
you know, is just be
logged out of my accounts

416
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:13,861
until it's time to post.

417
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,088
You know what I mean?

418
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:18,090
Like that, that...

419
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,604
- By the way, I think that's phenomenal.

420
00:14:19,604 --> 00:14:21,205
- Yeah.
- Here's my thing,

421
00:14:21,205 --> 00:14:22,248
everybody needs to do....

422
00:14:22,248 --> 00:14:24,784
Everybody needs to do their own thing.

423
00:14:24,784 --> 00:14:27,292
Like I just don't understand
what the difference is

424
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:30,537
between fucking reading
a stream on the bus

425
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,370
where amongst people

426
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,492
or like the person who's
reading the newspaper.

427
00:14:33,492 --> 00:14:35,099
We consume content.

428
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:36,154
- That is a huge difference, bro.

429
00:14:36,154 --> 00:14:37,986
When we would watch

430
00:14:37,986 --> 00:14:41,449
fucking the NBA on NBC (hums).

431
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:42,451
- Yeah.
- You wouldn't also--

432
00:14:42,451 --> 00:14:43,764
- I was gonna steal it.
- You wouldn't also be looking

433
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:44,597
at booty photos,

434
00:14:44,597 --> 00:14:46,441
you wouldn't also be
listening to the radio,

435
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:48,194
you wouldn't also be
doing all those things.

436
00:14:48,194 --> 00:14:50,329
You just wouldn't do it.

437
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:51,868
Bro, I'm saying for myself.
- I'm listening.

438
00:14:51,868 --> 00:14:53,276
No, I'm listening.
- I felt that thing.

439
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:55,566
I felt that ADD anxiety.
- And?

440
00:14:55,566 --> 00:14:56,834
- You know and I've been like,

441
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:58,058
alright you gotta...

442
00:14:58,058 --> 00:15:00,774
Look, it's a push platform, log out.

443
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,332
You gotta be about your jokes right now.

444
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:05,759
You gotta be about your pitches
and your show right now.

445
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,218
Don't, don't be going go down that rab...

446
00:15:09,218 --> 00:15:11,498
Rabbit hole is a real rabbit hole.

447
00:15:11,498 --> 00:15:13,746
- That rabbit hole was consumed

448
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,812
by something else in the past.

449
00:15:16,812 --> 00:15:21,519
This notion that we were
miraculously more productive

450
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,519
in 1964 is a huge farce.

451
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:26,696
The end.

452
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,780
We just did different things.

453
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,197
We romanticize reading a book

454
00:15:34,072 --> 00:15:36,293
or like watching The Cosby Show.

455
00:15:36,293 --> 00:15:38,262
Like I fucking sat on my fat ass

456
00:15:38,262 --> 00:15:40,365
and played fucking Mike Tyson's Punch Out

457
00:15:40,365 --> 00:15:41,198
for an hour and a half,

458
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:43,201
then watched fucking The Facts of Life,

459
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:45,085
Three's Company, like it's just--

460
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:47,581
- You wasted time, but you're
doing one thing at a time.

461
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:49,123
Which is why I think anxiety was less.

462
00:15:49,123 --> 00:15:50,503
You were still wasting time, bro

463
00:15:50,503 --> 00:15:52,343
and getting Ds and Fs.
- That's fine.

464
00:15:52,343 --> 00:15:54,381
(chuckles)
- It's true.

465
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:55,839
- But you're doing one thing,

466
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,578
you know what I mean?

467
00:15:57,578 --> 00:16:00,960
- Anxiety is not an all time high.

468
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,372
We're just having a proper
conversation around anxiety.

469
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:06,026
People have always had anxiety.

470
00:16:06,026 --> 00:16:06,995
- How do you feel about this, man?

471
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:07,828
You're in your bed,

472
00:16:07,828 --> 00:16:09,765
the first thing you do is
you don't look at your girl

473
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:12,085
or whoever, you look at this.

474
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:13,313
- Yeah, no--
- Come on, bro.

475
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:15,944
- No, no, no, I'm with--

476
00:16:15,944 --> 00:16:17,238
- You're selling, you're selling.

477
00:16:17,238 --> 00:16:18,644
Let him answer, you're like,

478
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,995
you're leading the witness, bro.

479
00:16:19,995 --> 00:16:21,741
- Typically before every
time before I go to sleep,

480
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:22,785
I find myself saying

481
00:16:22,785 --> 00:16:24,700
why the fuck can't I stop
scrolling down Twitter

482
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,944
and just go to bed.

483
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:28,901
I think as a habitual,
I'm fascinated by...

484
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:31,949
Habitual, like, habitual acts and

485
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,105
so basically plugging
your phone in 30 seconds

486
00:16:34,105 --> 00:16:37,278
before I consciously am
realizing what I'm doing.

487
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:38,951
So from a habitual aspect,

488
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:40,389
but I also agree that

489
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:42,430
the habit would just be somewhere else.

490
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,453
- A yellow pad?

491
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:46,416
When I see yellow pads, I
think smart shit's happening.

492
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,999
- Bro, this is why.

493
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:51,838
This is my two cents,

494
00:16:51,838 --> 00:16:55,749
if you're an artist and
you're doing this...

495
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,000
No, it's, your life has to be this.

496
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,100
- Me as an artist,

497
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,754
thinks that the fact that my man here

498
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:03,587
put a medium at a pedestal is sad.

499
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,298
The difference between
this and that is zero,

500
00:17:08,298 --> 00:17:09,996
it's what's on it.

501
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:11,978
- Is it weird that I'm doing this?

502
00:17:11,978 --> 00:17:14,278
- No, you're like a comic
that works out onstage.

503
00:17:14,278 --> 00:17:15,111
- No, no!

504
00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:17,200
You're better than this in his language.

505
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,258
- Oh. (laughs)

506
00:17:18,258 --> 00:17:21,583
- In his language, yours
is more pure and historic.

507
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,672
To me it's all the same shit.

508
00:17:24,672 --> 00:17:25,505
- You write in your head?

509
00:17:25,505 --> 00:17:26,741
- I'm gonna start writing in my head

510
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:28,310
cause I think it's fucking cool.

511
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,099
- But then you read like Eminem's book

512
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:32,589
and that shit was like to the bri...

513
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:35,425
I'm saying whatever your style
is, is your style, right?

514
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:36,258
That's fine.

515
00:17:36,258 --> 00:17:37,964
I'm saying this new, this...

516
00:17:37,964 --> 00:17:39,732
Bro, like, by the way

517
00:17:39,732 --> 00:17:43,649
I'm not gonna front as if I'm not in 2017.

518
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:46,108
I mean, let's be real like
I'm not fucking around.

519
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:48,342
- It's Google Docs for days.

520
00:17:48,342 --> 00:17:49,175
- I mean come on, man.

521
00:17:49,175 --> 00:17:51,115
We got new takes, we got old takes.

522
00:17:51,115 --> 00:17:52,157
I mean this just...

523
00:17:52,157 --> 00:17:53,466
This is forced.

524
00:17:53,466 --> 00:17:55,485
I mean it really is just nerd

525
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:57,197
(background noises
drowns out conversation)

526
00:17:57,197 --> 00:17:59,728
- Yo, I think we should go to that tree

527
00:17:59,728 --> 00:18:01,217
and carve some of our thoughts into it.

528
00:18:01,217 --> 00:18:02,655
(laughs)
- Come on, man.

529
00:18:02,655 --> 00:18:04,825
- Engrave them in a--
- Yeah, that's how,

530
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:06,714
that's the more.

531
00:18:06,714 --> 00:18:08,964
We put mediums on pedestals

532
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:13,611
instead of what's actually
being put on those mediums.

533
00:18:13,611 --> 00:18:18,180
- You have been able to
use social media for...

534
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,844
You wield it very--
- My love for

535
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:22,101
social media is zero.

536
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,434
- I, a lot of times, am like

537
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,472
fuck, I'm inside too
much using too much tech

538
00:18:28,472 --> 00:18:29,305
blah blah blah.

539
00:18:29,305 --> 00:18:30,646
I'm on it, fucking it catches me in it,

540
00:18:30,646 --> 00:18:32,108
I'm in a loop, why am I doing this?

541
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:34,338
I just wanna be outside in
the park, da da da da da.

542
00:18:34,338 --> 00:18:36,136
But then I'm like,

543
00:18:36,136 --> 00:18:39,295
well then I can just go
fucking do that if I want.

544
00:18:39,295 --> 00:18:41,784
So that's always my go back to it.

545
00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:42,951
But there's...

546
00:18:44,003 --> 00:18:46,892
Majority of the days, I find myself saying

547
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,224
I'm fucking sitting here
in front of this computer.

548
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:50,591
- Yeah, and by the way--
- I don't know what the true

549
00:18:50,591 --> 00:18:52,196
(mumbles) I wanna be outside.

550
00:18:52,196 --> 00:18:53,110
I wanna be camping,
- Yeah.

551
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,032
- I wanna be fucking at the grand--

552
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,238
- We can evolve and
present healthier choices.

553
00:18:56,238 --> 00:18:59,273
- Anti-technology propaganda.

554
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:01,945
- Dude, this was our shit
our whole life growing up

555
00:19:01,945 --> 00:19:03,143
and now people are like this is,

556
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,894
refined sugar's bad.
- My man, my man, my man.

557
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:05,772
- There's a healthier alternative.

558
00:19:05,772 --> 00:19:07,449
- You can--
- Y'all sound like

559
00:19:07,449 --> 00:19:08,983
y'all talking about each, either or.

560
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:10,983
- You guys, you can have both.

561
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,303
Here's my thing, you're in control.

562
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,536
Do you.

563
00:19:15,536 --> 00:19:17,451
But don't shit on the
other person's thing.

564
00:19:17,451 --> 00:19:19,012
Like I'm not judging anybody else's.

565
00:19:19,012 --> 00:19:20,484
Like my whole thing for a lot of people

566
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:22,617
is like people keep
throwing things at me like,

567
00:19:22,617 --> 00:19:23,515
yo this, this, this.

568
00:19:23,515 --> 00:19:27,011
I'm like cool, but I'm never like yo.

569
00:19:27,011 --> 00:19:28,930
Like I'll never start like

570
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,615
yo, why you putting the paper

571
00:19:30,615 --> 00:19:32,629
and the envelope on a pedestal?

572
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,736
I'm just responding,

573
00:19:33,736 --> 00:19:35,445
I'm counter punching on this issue.

574
00:19:35,445 --> 00:19:38,066
Like to me, life's about choices.

575
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:39,728
I think the thing super interesting about

576
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:41,823
social or digital what have you is

577
00:19:41,823 --> 00:19:44,601
first of all, I bet you
everybody at this table

578
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,506
agrees that ten years from now,

579
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:48,005
we're deeper into the tech.

580
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:50,754
We're not further away.
- Yeah.

581
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:53,267
- Now do I think they'll
be some cool hipster

582
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:56,947
counter-cultural like yo,
I'm on a 500 day detox

583
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,737
I haven't been on, of course.

584
00:19:58,737 --> 00:20:00,512
Because anything that swings,

585
00:20:00,512 --> 00:20:02,364
it's like social itself.

586
00:20:02,364 --> 00:20:04,210
Facebook and Twitter were open,

587
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,194
Snapchat came along and
people are like yeah.

588
00:20:06,194 --> 00:20:07,501
You know, it just swings.

589
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:09,168
But the punchline is

590
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,125
this entire conversation for me

591
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,392
is the continuation of the
gross underestimisation

592
00:20:15,392 --> 00:20:17,111
of the human being.

593
00:20:17,111 --> 00:20:20,079
We are so much more capable,

594
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,072
like anxiety hasn't
happened because technology.

595
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:25,738
Anxiety's happening because

596
00:20:25,738 --> 00:20:28,045
we're evolving in the conversations.

597
00:20:28,045 --> 00:20:30,685
The conversation around alcoholism

598
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:32,888
40 years ago was a disaster.

599
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:34,956
Like, we're finally
having good conversations

600
00:20:34,956 --> 00:20:36,084
around mental health.

601
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:39,641
Like I'm thrilled we talk about it more.

602
00:20:39,641 --> 00:20:40,857
Like there was, guys,

603
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:42,942
you know how many people?

604
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,755
Guys, bullying isn't a
phenomenon on social media.

605
00:20:45,755 --> 00:20:48,337
Bullying's a phenomenon of parents

606
00:20:48,337 --> 00:20:51,905
creating fake realities for children.

607
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:54,128
There's a lot of variables
that go into this,

608
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,249
it's not just one thing.

609
00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:58,202
I mean, when I was kid.

610
00:20:58,202 --> 00:21:02,474
Bullying, like, your parents
are getting so involved now

611
00:21:02,474 --> 00:21:04,850
that you feel they need
to help you out of it,

612
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,223
not you work yourself out of it.

613
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,417
Now kids have diseases
and bullying's extreme,

614
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:12,812
I got it but like this
thought that like...

615
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:16,144
that like, we're not looking
at the counter angle to this.

616
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:19,203
So for example, the amount
of kids that are happy today

617
00:21:19,203 --> 00:21:22,337
at 14 because they got
their friends on Twitch

618
00:21:22,337 --> 00:21:25,142
that literally 20 years
ago would've been miserable

619
00:21:25,142 --> 00:21:27,189
and would've been sick and
would've been depressed

620
00:21:27,189 --> 00:21:29,099
cause everybody at school fucked with them

621
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:31,703
and they didn't have
somewhere to go like Twitch

622
00:21:31,703 --> 00:21:32,992
to find their own.

623
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:34,562
We're just looking at the negative,

624
00:21:34,562 --> 00:21:35,654
we're not looking at the pro.

625
00:21:35,654 --> 00:21:36,565
Here's what I think,

626
00:21:36,565 --> 00:21:40,084
on the biggest macro and then
everything else is secondary.

627
00:21:40,084 --> 00:21:41,956
We were full of shit

628
00:21:41,956 --> 00:21:44,097
and it's time for the
fucking day of reckoning

629
00:21:44,097 --> 00:21:46,497
and, by the way, we're in the beginning.

630
00:21:46,497 --> 00:21:49,505
Shit's about to get way worse.

631
00:21:49,505 --> 00:21:50,338
- Be specific.

632
00:21:50,338 --> 00:21:51,642
I don't understand what you're saying.

633
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:53,499
- Shit's about to hit
the fan for everybody.

634
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:55,861
Shit's, we're getting naked.

635
00:21:55,861 --> 00:21:57,615
This is the beginning of us getting naked.

636
00:21:57,615 --> 00:22:00,700
We're systematically
over the next two decades

637
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,907
gonna face our fucking truths

638
00:22:02,907 --> 00:22:04,646
that we don't want to fucking face.

639
00:22:04,646 --> 00:22:06,893
Like, lots and lots and lots of things.

640
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:08,848
Like, every single issue.

641
00:22:08,848 --> 00:22:10,316
There's nowhere to hide, the media...

642
00:22:10,316 --> 00:22:13,506
The media, whether
controlled by a dictator

643
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:17,451
or by rich tycoons, was
the filter of our thoughts.

644
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:19,044
Now everybody's getting exposed,

645
00:22:19,044 --> 00:22:22,145
so like first we have to
face some real truths.

646
00:22:22,145 --> 00:22:24,395
Like, I don't think like...

647
00:22:25,723 --> 00:22:28,408
We're gonna have to face
some real truths, man.

648
00:22:28,408 --> 00:22:32,170
Like we need some real
corrections across the board

649
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,987
and we're just gonna
go through that cycle,

650
00:22:33,987 --> 00:22:36,616
like everything bad is
gonna get out in the open.

651
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:38,862
- I think misinformation's
happening in scale, though.

652
00:22:38,862 --> 00:22:41,135
We're not having enough
correct correction, yeah.

653
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:43,105
- So misinformation was
always happening, though.

654
00:22:43,105 --> 00:22:44,712
Like let's take that back.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

655
00:22:44,712 --> 00:22:47,610
- Here's the most different
thing that's happening,

656
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:51,071
if you have power, you're not safe.

657
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:54,164
The biggest shift today from 30 years ago

658
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,254
is if you have leverage,

659
00:22:56,254 --> 00:22:59,621
you can't use it to control the narrative.

660
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:02,713
All we are is the serendipity
of like moments in time.

661
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:05,537
I think everybody's got a really...

662
00:23:05,537 --> 00:23:07,973
Is gonna struggle because
it's a chemical thing.

663
00:23:07,973 --> 00:23:09,789
Here's what's always been historic,

664
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:12,600
when you're in the middle of real change,

665
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,626
you're always like what the fuck.

666
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,697
Because you don't have the backdrop to--

667
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:18,747
- Right.
- Right?

668
00:23:18,747 --> 00:23:19,920
- So we're in the midst of--

669
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,999
- We're in the midst of real change.

670
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:21,971
The internet's a real...

671
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:23,947
Like this has been my
whole point the whole time

672
00:23:23,947 --> 00:23:26,348
and you as like the great
historian of my content,

673
00:23:26,348 --> 00:23:27,452
which I appreciate.

674
00:23:27,452 --> 00:23:28,754
Like, I believe in this shit, man.

675
00:23:28,754 --> 00:23:29,843
- (laughs) The great historian...

676
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:30,676
- Dude, this dude.

677
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:33,057
Honestly, dude, like I don't know

678
00:23:33,057 --> 00:23:34,973
if I've ever been more humbled.

679
00:23:34,973 --> 00:23:36,818
I'm being dead serious
and like I get flattered,

680
00:23:36,818 --> 00:23:40,683
I'm always pretty happy and surprised.

681
00:23:40,683 --> 00:23:43,673
Whoo, it's fucking, you
know, the 30th you're in it.

682
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:44,506
- I love it, dude.

683
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,391
- It's so impressive.

684
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:47,452
(conversations overlap and
background noise drowns them out)

685
00:23:47,452 --> 00:23:48,634
- It makes me think he's super smart

686
00:23:48,634 --> 00:23:49,757
that he's so deep into my content.

687
00:23:49,757 --> 00:23:50,590
- One of the things that I love

688
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,949
like when I was super, when I was like

689
00:23:52,949 --> 00:23:55,365
ah this is great, is
when you do Airport Gary.

690
00:23:55,365 --> 00:23:56,198
(laughs)

691
00:23:56,198 --> 00:23:57,131
Cause you get out on the streets,

692
00:23:57,131 --> 00:23:58,204
you just fucking...

693
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:00,832
His pants are down, shit
doesn't fit properly,

694
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:03,376
sometimes the shirt is too short.

695
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:04,882
- Oh yeah.
- Like that hat.

696
00:24:04,882 --> 00:24:06,467
- And then this is all paste,

697
00:24:06,467 --> 00:24:08,727
but he's fucking hustling.

698
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:11,227
No excuse and he doesn't care!

699
00:24:12,214 --> 00:24:13,943
And by the way, this
goes back to my point,

700
00:24:13,943 --> 00:24:15,593
in you know our industry...

701
00:24:15,593 --> 00:24:16,769
- Like, everybody's doing dumb shit.

702
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:19,731
- Everything--
(laughs)

703
00:24:19,731 --> 00:24:21,259
- But everything's set
up for Getty Images.

704
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,122
Bro, everything I know about Future

705
00:24:23,122 --> 00:24:25,566
is his shit is perfect,
his jewels are perf...

706
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:27,250
Everything's perfect.
- That's true.

707
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,827
- And what I think he's leveraging,

708
00:24:28,827 --> 00:24:30,983
which I think makes him unique,

709
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:33,193
is that it's like no, it's not like that.

710
00:24:33,193 --> 00:24:34,612
- Here's the best part.

711
00:24:34,612 --> 00:24:36,230
I don't even know it's broken.

712
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,772
I'm, like when I hear these stories,

713
00:24:38,772 --> 00:24:40,164
I get really excited

714
00:24:40,164 --> 00:24:41,488
because it speaks to a real aud--

715
00:24:41,488 --> 00:24:42,391
- Oh, how crazy you look?

716
00:24:42,391 --> 00:24:43,224
I put it on wax.

717
00:24:43,224 --> 00:24:44,057
I'm like you're crazy

718
00:24:44,057 --> 00:24:45,018
but I think you're doing
a lot of good things.

719
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:47,132
But, yeah, you look kind of
insane in those moments, yeah.

720
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:49,945
- It's when you don't
understand the actual...

721
00:24:49,945 --> 00:24:52,983
Like it's funny, I hear
stuff and sometimes I'm like

722
00:24:52,983 --> 00:24:54,706
I'm real smart and I really do...

723
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:57,841
I run the extreme of
being really, really smart

724
00:24:57,841 --> 00:24:59,249
and really knowing it

725
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:02,798
and then being completely
oblivious to certain shit

726
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:04,575
and then I'm so on.

727
00:25:04,575 --> 00:25:05,893
And in those two extremes

728
00:25:05,893 --> 00:25:07,912
comes what I think you've sniffed out,

729
00:25:07,912 --> 00:25:09,123
uniquely by the way,

730
00:25:09,123 --> 00:25:09,956
that's what it is.

731
00:25:09,956 --> 00:25:12,385
I don't even know when
I'm doing shit sometimes

732
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,062
and other times I really know.

733
00:25:14,062 --> 00:25:15,433
- What's the macro number, you think?

734
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:18,091
So is a fundamental good versus evil.

735
00:25:18,091 --> 00:25:21,241
I fundamentally present this issue:

736
00:25:21,241 --> 00:25:23,119
What is bigger, love or fear?

737
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,917
Unfortunately and I'm just
gonna be real with you guys

738
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:29,125
at the table, is that like, I
feel like fear is like sugar.

739
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:32,734
It's easier to tap into and
you can scale it faster.

740
00:25:32,734 --> 00:25:34,973
And love is a little bit tougher,

741
00:25:34,973 --> 00:25:37,245
to execute and scale.

742
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:38,823
- Yeah, but that's how I think.

743
00:25:38,823 --> 00:25:40,728
I agree, I think that's
generally human nature.

744
00:25:40,728 --> 00:25:43,323
- I think Voldemort is slightly
more powerful than Harry.

745
00:25:43,323 --> 00:25:46,605
52 to 48 or 60 to 40.
- I think human nature is

746
00:25:46,605 --> 00:25:48,334
- What app did I just lose?
- Be with the fear

747
00:25:48,334 --> 00:25:51,766
and then give the love
to kind of suppress it.

748
00:25:51,766 --> 00:25:52,600
- So what's the number?

749
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,251
Cause here's the thing,
it's a gray zone, right?

750
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:55,750
And I think that all that keeps happening

751
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,200
that it's either one or the other.

752
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,417
- I think evil--
- I think it's either all evil

753
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:00,254
or all love.

754
00:26:00,254 --> 00:26:01,563
I actually think it's the,

755
00:26:01,563 --> 00:26:02,718
what's the series at?

756
00:26:02,718 --> 00:26:04,260
Is it 70/30?
- I think where you had it.

757
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,778
- 60/40? 52/48?

758
00:26:05,778 --> 00:26:08,657
- Yeah, 52/48.
- One thing I posted about

759
00:26:08,657 --> 00:26:10,711
a couple of hours ago.
- Resist, respond and react

760
00:26:10,711 --> 00:26:13,359
to fear, you've lost. (laughs)

761
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:15,687
- I think, I think ...

762
00:26:15,687 --> 00:26:18,735
I think, I think fear wins in the micro

763
00:26:18,735 --> 00:26:21,334
and love wins in the macro.

764
00:26:21,334 --> 00:26:22,795
- Yeah.
- And I think when

765
00:26:22,795 --> 00:26:24,659
we're in moments of fear,

766
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:26,391
it feels so not close.

767
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:28,465
- How bout, how bout...
- And that's what we're in.

768
00:26:28,465 --> 00:26:29,485
What's super interesting to me

769
00:26:29,485 --> 00:26:31,532
is this whole notion that

770
00:26:31,532 --> 00:26:34,481
I really think everybody's famous.

771
00:26:34,481 --> 00:26:37,780
Or the notion of like how
many people you're famous to,

772
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,821
micro fame, like it's just...

773
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:41,253
The whole thing is being redefined.

774
00:26:41,253 --> 00:26:43,322
Like I think we might've
said in our podcast

775
00:26:43,322 --> 00:26:45,415
like the fact that I genuinely think

776
00:26:45,415 --> 00:26:47,865
the 30 most famous people on Instagram

777
00:26:47,865 --> 00:26:49,868
are unbelievably more famous than

778
00:26:49,868 --> 00:26:53,331
the 30 most famous
people not on Instagram.

779
00:26:53,331 --> 00:26:55,501
Like shit is getting so interesting.

780
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:59,983
I'm fascinated by how
famous you really need to be

781
00:26:59,983 --> 00:27:00,816
to, like, go somewhere

782
00:27:00,816 --> 00:27:03,009
where a lot of people know who you are.

783
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:04,538
Like a lot, a lot.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

784
00:27:04,538 --> 00:27:05,446
Who's like that?

785
00:27:05,446 --> 00:27:07,221
Like, uh...
- Drake.

786
00:27:07,221 --> 00:27:08,530
- Yeah, Drake, exactly.

787
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,399
Like if Rihanna walks down, Rihanna.

788
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:11,232
Like you gotta be--

789
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,711
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

790
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:13,544
- So.

791
00:27:15,698 --> 00:27:18,005
I think you hang out with
a lot of young people.

792
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:19,711
- Yes.
- Why is that?

793
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:22,320
- Um, cause I really think that

794
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,642
this is a very disproportionate time

795
00:27:25,642 --> 00:27:28,725
where the young people of our society

796
00:27:29,601 --> 00:27:32,176
are impacting from the ground up

797
00:27:32,176 --> 00:27:33,393
instead of top down.

798
00:27:33,393 --> 00:27:34,226
- But can I say something?

799
00:27:34,226 --> 00:27:35,268
The reason why I like to hang out with

800
00:27:35,268 --> 00:27:36,593
people who are older than me

801
00:27:36,593 --> 00:27:38,484
is a thing that I don't have, is wisdom.

802
00:27:38,484 --> 00:27:40,402
- I'm the same way.
- Wisdom is like,

803
00:27:40,402 --> 00:27:41,235
bro, wisdom is valuable.
- Yeah, I just like.

804
00:27:41,235 --> 00:27:42,068
I have a lot of wis...

805
00:27:42,068 --> 00:27:43,206
I have a lot of natural wisdom.

806
00:27:43,206 --> 00:27:44,648
(laughs)
- No, no, no, no, no.

807
00:27:44,648 --> 00:27:46,501
- I'm being serious a little bit.

808
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:47,357
So what's interesting...

809
00:27:47,357 --> 00:27:48,695
You might find this interesting.

810
00:27:48,695 --> 00:27:49,885
This is super interesting,

811
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:51,587
back to being hardcore about my content,

812
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,050
I don't say it that often.

813
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,688
I spent an unbelievable
amount of time as a kid

814
00:27:55,688 --> 00:27:57,509
with very old people.

815
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,951
Here's what I know

816
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:02,618
is that we are really,
really bad as a being

817
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:10,106
of like thinking things
through in a 360 way

818
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:15,125
when we either like the way
it turned out or we don't.

819
00:28:16,232 --> 00:28:17,065
You know what's funny?

820
00:28:17,065 --> 00:28:18,368
This has been the theme
of our conversation

821
00:28:18,368 --> 00:28:19,430
a little bit tonight,

822
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,990
my favorite thing.

823
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,731
My favorite thing about how
I go through all of this

824
00:28:24,731 --> 00:28:28,529
is I feel when I lose or
things don't go my way

825
00:28:28,529 --> 00:28:31,501
that I truly deserve
it in such a deep way.

826
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,246
When you just talked
about me losing it all,

827
00:28:33,246 --> 00:28:35,505
the only thing when I
talk about that shit,

828
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,545
here's my punchline on that:

829
00:28:37,545 --> 00:28:40,479
if it happens, it should've happened.

830
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:42,326
I deserved it to happen.

831
00:28:42,326 --> 00:28:44,843
And, like, to me that
I spend a lot of time

832
00:28:44,843 --> 00:28:45,676
thinking about that,

833
00:28:45,676 --> 00:28:47,363
I like when bad things happen cause

834
00:28:47,363 --> 00:28:50,921
I think if I'm gonna enjoy
the fruits of the victories,

835
00:28:50,921 --> 00:28:54,042
I have to learn from the
things that I fucked up on.

836
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:57,109
You have to respect the game
more than you respect yourself.

837
00:28:57,109 --> 00:28:59,419
Like in a weird way, you
have to respect the game more

838
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:01,455
than what you want out of the game.

839
00:29:01,455 --> 00:29:03,078
- That was an Omar line.
- What?

840
00:29:03,078 --> 00:29:04,900
- That was an Omar line from The Wire.

841
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,460
- Did you read a lot of
Buddhism books or something?

842
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,179
- No, but I'm sup--
- How did you center your--?

843
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,339
- No, because--
- That takes a lot

844
00:29:09,339 --> 00:29:10,172
of centering.
- Honestly, I'm telling you

845
00:29:10,172 --> 00:29:11,720
right now, it's so interesting

846
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,099
and I've never thought about this.

847
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:13,932
About the young thing.

848
00:29:13,932 --> 00:29:14,765
I'm like, oh fuck.

849
00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:16,952
While we were talking, the
other part of my brain is like

850
00:29:16,952 --> 00:29:18,644
oh fuck, that's gonna be the punchline.

851
00:29:18,644 --> 00:29:21,199
I spent my first twenty years
with fucking 80 year olds

852
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:22,631
and when I'm 80, I'm
gonna spend all my time

853
00:29:22,631 --> 00:29:24,250
with 20 year olds, it's gonna get worse.

854
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,712
What I'm doing right
now is gonna get worse.

855
00:29:25,712 --> 00:29:26,545
- Yeah, please don't do that.

856
00:29:26,545 --> 00:29:27,594
It's gonna be creepy.

857
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:29,561
Wait until you see me at 63 being like,

858
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:31,735
hey, 14 year old girl, come over here.

859
00:29:31,735 --> 00:29:33,517
(laughter drowns out conversation)

860
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:35,571
Like that's my, you know.
- No, I know.

861
00:29:35,571 --> 00:29:38,000
(laughter drowns out conversation)

862
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,386
Airport Gary's crazy enough to do that.

863
00:29:39,386 --> 00:29:40,848
He'll be like on his
knees in front of a bag

864
00:29:40,848 --> 00:29:41,765
and be like, you're 13?

865
00:29:41,765 --> 00:29:42,842
What are you watching?

866
00:29:42,842 --> 00:29:44,594
- By the way, by the way, by the way,

867
00:29:44,594 --> 00:29:47,753
it happened even before
I was filming, thank God.

868
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,712
It was when Snapchat was popping.

869
00:29:49,712 --> 00:29:52,517
Snapchat was popping and I couldn't tell,

870
00:29:52,517 --> 00:29:54,454
couldn't see, I didn't know what it was

871
00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:57,033
but I saw, literally, exactly

872
00:29:57,033 --> 00:29:59,198
in the corner of my eye
a couple of times like,

873
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:02,027
there's some yellow app
that these kids are...

874
00:30:02,027 --> 00:30:03,987
Like that's how I first
knew about Snapchat.

875
00:30:03,987 --> 00:30:06,302
And I went to the app store
and looked for a yellow app.

876
00:30:06,302 --> 00:30:07,805
Nothing.

877
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:10,067
And I'm like some shit's
going down, that I...

878
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:10,900
You know what I mean?

879
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,180
You know there's like a party, why am I...

880
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,247
Like you're in dorm and you're like

881
00:30:14,247 --> 00:30:15,601
there's a party I'm not in...

882
00:30:15,601 --> 00:30:17,235
I was like there's something wrong.

883
00:30:17,235 --> 00:30:19,316
So finally, like I caught it.

884
00:30:19,316 --> 00:30:22,200
Like I saw somebody again
and I went in her shit,

885
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,756
she was like 14 and I'm like all in it

886
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,118
and then I look and the dad's like

887
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:28,451
what the fuck are you doing?

888
00:30:29,782 --> 00:30:30,767
I was like yo.

889
00:30:30,767 --> 00:30:32,414
(laughs)

890
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:33,247
Sorry.

891
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:37,771
The first thing that
has always worked for me

892
00:30:37,771 --> 00:30:41,521
is never allowing somebody
to have leverage on you.

893
00:30:41,521 --> 00:30:42,603
- And this shit,

894
00:30:42,603 --> 00:30:44,584
because I didn't want to
fuck with that person.

895
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:45,901
- That's, me too.
- Cause that was like.

896
00:30:45,901 --> 00:30:47,650
- Good, me too.
- That was like...

897
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,960
- Like, that's great but I don't even...

898
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,076
The key is to like,
I've gotten to the point

899
00:30:52,076 --> 00:30:55,484
where I don't even realize
I'm missing it anymore.

900
00:30:55,484 --> 00:30:58,283
Because it becomes practice.

901
00:30:58,283 --> 00:31:00,347
Honestly, I'll give you a good example.

902
00:31:00,347 --> 00:31:02,683
Look at our table right now.

903
00:31:02,683 --> 00:31:04,796
Do you know how serious
amount of food this is

904
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,423
for so many people around the world?

905
00:31:06,423 --> 00:31:07,256
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I know.

906
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:09,248
I was, yes.
(laughs)

907
00:31:09,248 --> 00:31:11,042
I'm like my parents would be revolted.

908
00:31:11,042 --> 00:31:11,875
- Right?

909
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:13,297
So I look at this, right?

910
00:31:13,297 --> 00:31:15,182
This is how I look at your question.

911
00:31:15,182 --> 00:31:17,926
There's so much to eat,

912
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:20,022
you don't need.
- Oh, right right.

913
00:31:20,022 --> 00:31:22,461
- So I don't think like
oh, I better go like...

914
00:31:22,461 --> 00:31:23,330
For you, right?

915
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,104
It's like, oh shit I hate that person

916
00:31:25,104 --> 00:31:28,055
but that person is the
person that plays the record

917
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:29,775
or that person picks the playlist

918
00:31:29,775 --> 00:31:34,432
for the 84 million person
playlist on Spotify or SoundCloud.

919
00:31:34,432 --> 00:31:37,487
I'm kind of just like, mrr.

920
00:31:37,487 --> 00:31:39,895
I don't even like, I'm like...

921
00:31:39,895 --> 00:31:43,312
To me this is why if you really break down

922
00:31:43,312 --> 00:31:44,724
what I'm always saying,

923
00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:47,897
I'm just like bring so much
value to the end person

924
00:31:47,897 --> 00:31:50,132
so that you have the most leverage.

925
00:31:50,132 --> 00:31:53,133
Amazon gives us the best thing.

926
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:56,300
We all love Amazon cause it's the best

927
00:31:57,389 --> 00:32:01,781
buying experience, thus Amazon
will kill everybody else

928
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:03,624
cause they're the best to the consumer.

929
00:32:03,624 --> 00:32:08,420
I want your control of the
thing that most people see

930
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,729
because if you bring the most value,

931
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:12,219
then you have the leverage.

932
00:32:12,219 --> 00:32:16,386
Everybody comes to me because
I'm giving value at scale

933
00:32:17,573 --> 00:32:19,784
with no expectation of anything else.

934
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:20,729
Can I tell you something?

935
00:32:20,729 --> 00:32:22,436
Can I tell you something?

936
00:32:22,436 --> 00:32:24,513
Can I tell you something?

937
00:32:24,513 --> 00:32:25,405
I'm gonna give you a real...

938
00:32:25,405 --> 00:32:27,623
Like, something really just hit me.

939
00:32:27,623 --> 00:32:29,545
I think you should shut everything out.

940
00:32:29,545 --> 00:32:30,378
- Do what?

941
00:32:30,378 --> 00:32:31,495
- You should shut everything out.

942
00:32:31,495 --> 00:32:33,194
- I think maybe you could take actually

943
00:32:33,194 --> 00:32:36,338
the passwords off your social and

944
00:32:36,338 --> 00:32:38,445
you know maybe follow
my take on the issue.

945
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:40,793
- I think you should
keep your passwords on

946
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:43,142
and just go reply to every single person.

947
00:32:43,142 --> 00:32:45,067
You need to go insular for a year.

948
00:32:45,067 --> 00:32:49,271
You, your shit and your
fans and nothing else.

949
00:32:49,271 --> 00:32:50,763
Truth always wins.

950
00:32:50,763 --> 00:32:52,891
I don't, it's unbelievable how

951
00:32:52,891 --> 00:32:56,503
like I've never had scrutiny at this level

952
00:32:56,503 --> 00:32:58,166
from people I respect

953
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:01,202
or bigger people than
right this minute going on.

954
00:33:01,202 --> 00:33:04,340
And I've never felt more calm about it.

955
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,106
It's interesting like how momentum--

956
00:33:06,106 --> 00:33:07,786
- You didn't answer my
question about how--

957
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:08,619
- I apologize.

958
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:09,612
- How'd you get that attention?

959
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,480
- Because I know what the fuck I'm up to.

960
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,801
Because I know what I'm up to.

961
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:15,638
Like how I am has a lot to do
with the way I was parented,

962
00:33:15,638 --> 00:33:18,497
how I grew up, a million
different variables.

963
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,894
But in it's current state of the union,

964
00:33:20,894 --> 00:33:24,375
like this second, I just
know how it's gonna play out.

965
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:26,697
- But I also think he'd be
this confident if he was broke.

966
00:33:26,697 --> 00:33:27,530
He's truly crazy.

967
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,765
- That's what I'm saying.
- Sorry, dude.

968
00:33:28,765 --> 00:33:30,670
He's crazy.
- That's the centered part!

969
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,101
Like I just realized even with good shit,

970
00:33:33,101 --> 00:33:35,145
certain good things happening to me now,

971
00:33:35,145 --> 00:33:36,486
I felt like that shit was gonna fix

972
00:33:36,486 --> 00:33:38,846
some of the problems
or make me feel better.

973
00:33:38,846 --> 00:33:40,863
But, you know, everybody
tells you that shit

974
00:33:40,863 --> 00:33:41,956
but you don't fucking take it in--

975
00:33:41,956 --> 00:33:43,305
- You know what's crazy?

976
00:33:43,305 --> 00:33:44,737
You're lucky you didn't get, pop out

977
00:33:44,737 --> 00:33:45,768
cause that shit would've exposed

978
00:33:45,768 --> 00:33:48,099
and accelerated the negative.

979
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:51,589
Exposure, like wealth
and people's eyes on you

980
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:53,922
exposes your truths.
- Mmhmm.

981
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,852
- Money and fame expose who you are,

982
00:33:57,852 --> 00:33:58,685
they don't change...

983
00:33:58,685 --> 00:33:59,518
People are like, oh he changed.

984
00:33:59,518 --> 00:34:00,418
He didn't change.

985
00:34:00,418 --> 00:34:03,023
He was fucked the fuck up, you
just weren't paying attention

986
00:34:03,023 --> 00:34:04,651
cause you didn't give a fuck.

987
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:05,795
It's also patient.

988
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:06,928
You know how much I love it, man.

989
00:34:06,928 --> 00:34:10,253
Especially when I'm talking,
when you're talking 24.

990
00:34:10,253 --> 00:34:12,757
Ooh, you have such an advantage, man.

991
00:34:12,757 --> 00:34:14,273
I think people don't believe me, I guess.

992
00:34:14,274 --> 00:34:15,969
- I'm not 24, though.
- How old are you, 27?

993
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:17,494
- I'm about to be 29.
- But patience, Gary,

994
00:34:17,494 --> 00:34:18,942
- Really? You look great, man.

995
00:34:18,942 --> 00:34:21,607
- Patience is a thing
that comes with wisdom.

996
00:34:21,607 --> 00:34:22,585
(laughs)
- I understand.

997
00:34:22,585 --> 00:34:23,913
- I'm telling you, wisdom
is really important.

998
00:34:23,913 --> 00:34:25,150
- Patience comes with being broke.

999
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,545
- I think a lot of people who are broke

1000
00:34:26,545 --> 00:34:27,734
struggle with patience cause they just

1001
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:29,786
want to get the fuck out.

1002
00:34:29,786 --> 00:34:30,619
- I agree with you on that.

1003
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,732
- I think broke actually creates (sighs)--

1004
00:34:33,732 --> 00:34:34,565
- I think it's two ways.

1005
00:34:34,565 --> 00:34:36,353
I think you can either take it that way

1006
00:34:36,353 --> 00:34:37,411
or you take it as a person--

1007
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:38,244
- And, honestly, man.

1008
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:39,077
Honestly--
- I'm always gonna be with

1009
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,204
like this broke shit
- Honestly.

1010
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:44,449
Honestly, this is why I'm
obsessed with positivity

1011
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,634
and mindset and parenting.

1012
00:34:46,635 --> 00:34:49,442
Like we could debate
this all the way through,

1013
00:34:49,442 --> 00:34:51,442
if you're good, you're good.

1014
00:34:51,442 --> 00:34:56,165
This shit is so basic, if
you're good you're just good.

1015
00:34:56,165 --> 00:34:59,492
Just trying to get people
to be good, you know?

1016
00:34:59,492 --> 00:35:00,992
Like, perspective.

1017
00:35:01,876 --> 00:35:05,965
- Now I think the big
thing that Super Duper Kyle

1018
00:35:05,965 --> 00:35:07,925
and Russ and all these
guys are gonna deal with,

1019
00:35:07,925 --> 00:35:09,873
is the same thing Yung
Joc and all those guys

1020
00:35:09,873 --> 00:35:13,405
are facing going on is, what
is the thing that you do

1021
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:15,700
to then once you have that moment

1022
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,318
to have longevity in that career?

1023
00:35:18,318 --> 00:35:19,365
What's your opinion?

1024
00:35:19,365 --> 00:35:21,906
- The answer's very simple to me on this.

1025
00:35:21,906 --> 00:35:23,906
The truth is undefeated.

1026
00:35:25,005 --> 00:35:28,059
Meaning there have been one hit wonders

1027
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,392
long before Yung Joc, right?

1028
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:33,225
So--
(laughs)

1029
00:35:33,225 --> 00:35:34,392
So my thought,

1030
00:35:36,383 --> 00:35:39,688
my thought on this is very
simple, the following:

1031
00:35:39,688 --> 00:35:40,618
- Remember that crazy interview,

1032
00:35:40,618 --> 00:35:41,824
you talk about I stood in that window

1033
00:35:41,824 --> 00:35:43,181
as long as I possibly could?
- Stretch.

1034
00:35:43,181 --> 00:35:45,949
- Yeah, he's the longest.
- Yeah.

1035
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:47,821
- Everybody else is--
- We talked about this earlier

1036
00:35:47,821 --> 00:35:49,739
when you weren't here, but
let him finish real fast.

1037
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:51,537
- My thought on this is very simple,

1038
00:35:51,537 --> 00:35:54,238
perfection scares the fuck out of me.

1039
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:55,655
- You're perfection scared.
- Yeah.

1040
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:57,385
- Okay.
- I see so many of my homies,

1041
00:35:57,385 --> 00:35:59,356
that's what I'm worried about with you.

1042
00:35:59,356 --> 00:36:00,538
And perfection scares the piss...

1043
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:01,717
And I don't know, right?

1044
00:36:01,717 --> 00:36:04,448
It just, quick read, I hope it's not that

1045
00:36:04,448 --> 00:36:06,253
cause if it's that,

1046
00:36:06,253 --> 00:36:08,988
that's real hard to break through.

1047
00:36:08,988 --> 00:36:11,250
But yeah, I mean, I think
the truth plays out.

1048
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,243
You know, like for
example, Trinidad James.

1049
00:36:14,243 --> 00:36:17,136
I'm super intrigued by him right now

1050
00:36:17,136 --> 00:36:21,030
because I think he is
like right on the pedestal

1051
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,837
of the last decade of
hip hop one hit wonders.

1052
00:36:24,837 --> 00:36:26,919
And, like, I'm watching
what he's doing right now

1053
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:29,015
and I'm like interacting
a little bit with him,

1054
00:36:29,015 --> 00:36:32,522
I'm like fuck, man, it'll
be really interesting to see

1055
00:36:32,522 --> 00:36:34,107
if he's got anything else in the can.

1056
00:36:34,107 --> 00:36:35,889
But my big thing is that

1057
00:36:35,889 --> 00:36:40,151
being a one hit wonder is better
than being a no hit wonder.

1058
00:36:40,151 --> 00:36:41,750
I really do believe that.

1059
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,858
Meaning, meaning, it all
comes down to the psyche.

1060
00:36:44,858 --> 00:36:46,471
There's people back to being grounded,

1061
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:47,304
back to you saying,

1062
00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:50,508
"Gary, you could do
that, but the 99 can't"

1063
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,061
with the whole like, right?

1064
00:36:52,061 --> 00:36:55,082
Here's my thing, there's people
who've been one hit wonders

1065
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:58,372
or child stars, we focus on all the people

1066
00:36:58,372 --> 00:36:59,550
that got fucked up,

1067
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,091
we don't look at the macro math.

1068
00:37:01,091 --> 00:37:03,492
We focus on the 13%
that couldn't handle it

1069
00:37:03,492 --> 00:37:05,642
and exploded in front of our faces

1070
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:08,108
without understanding the 87%.

1071
00:37:08,108 --> 00:37:10,204
There was plenty of
stars of Punky Brewster

1072
00:37:10,204 --> 00:37:13,100
and Growing Pains that
live nice fucking lives

1073
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,019
and like make funny jokes with ea--

1074
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:16,249
- But we focus on Macaulay Culkin.

1075
00:37:16,249 --> 00:37:17,477
- Correct, correct.

1076
00:37:17,477 --> 00:37:19,562
Like to me, it's like when I talked about

1077
00:37:19,562 --> 00:37:21,918
the Sneaker Project, I really meant it.

1078
00:37:21,918 --> 00:37:22,844
I don't know if people...

1079
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:25,523
Like, I'm always confused
what people are thinking.

1080
00:37:25,523 --> 00:37:27,785
I would've thought it was phenomenal

1081
00:37:27,785 --> 00:37:29,201
if we were sitting here in 15 years

1082
00:37:29,201 --> 00:37:30,939
and be like, Mm you fucking
thought you could have this...

1083
00:37:30,939 --> 00:37:32,760
Like there's nothing more fun

1084
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,755
than having your buddies make fun of you

1085
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:37,738
of audacious shit that you've failed on.

1086
00:37:37,738 --> 00:37:38,910
Like somebody, like you!

1087
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,942
You said something about
planet of the apps,

1088
00:37:40,942 --> 00:37:44,485
I was so, I was dying
because what I was like

1089
00:37:44,485 --> 00:37:45,769
was like, okay, motherfucker,

1090
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:48,101
I'm literally gonna have
a Netflix fucking special

1091
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:49,271
that's gonna be downloaded more than you,

1092
00:37:49,271 --> 00:37:50,349
you fucking comedian.

1093
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:51,407
Like you either have that, right?

1094
00:37:51,407 --> 00:37:55,260
(laughs)
- Like you either have--

1095
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,093
But this is the truth.

1096
00:37:56,093 --> 00:37:57,226
I'm giving you my truth.

1097
00:37:57,226 --> 00:38:01,016
You either have that gear
or you're like (hums).

1098
00:38:01,016 --> 00:38:02,360
- No, there's no way I'm doing that.

1099
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,485
- Right?

1100
00:38:03,485 --> 00:38:05,763
There's a prelogue to
the Airplane Project.

1101
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:07,638
- Prologue.
- Prologue, thank you.

1102
00:38:07,638 --> 00:38:09,971
There's a prologue where Drock says,

1103
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:12,649
it's not gonna work, but the good stuff--

1104
00:38:12,649 --> 00:38:13,771
- Is the verdict out?

1105
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:15,529
- The verdict's out, I won.

1106
00:38:15,529 --> 00:38:16,960
Fucking it dominated.

1107
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,699
(background noises muffle conversation)

1108
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,510
(laughs)
- It's all there!

1109
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,841
- The energy that you're
deploying right now

1110
00:38:25,841 --> 00:38:28,062
versus the reality of your energy,

1111
00:38:28,062 --> 00:38:30,800
which was like audacious post-production

1112
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,021
like this isn't gonna work,
nobody wants to hear your

1113
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:35,589
ums and oohs and I'm gonna clean it up

1114
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:38,486
and I'm like, you're not
gonna clean anything.

1115
00:38:38,486 --> 00:38:41,241
- I'm with DRock on this.
- Of course you do.

1116
00:38:41,241 --> 00:38:43,715
- I think you could still--
- You two Hollywood fuckers.

1117
00:38:43,715 --> 00:38:45,798
(laughs)

1118
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:50,018
Do you know what I think
your career would be at

1119
00:38:50,018 --> 00:38:53,527
if you threw more non
polished stuff at scale?

1120
00:38:53,527 --> 00:38:56,694
You'd be in outer space.
- Okay, okay.

1121
00:38:58,101 --> 00:39:00,718
Something I'm considering.
- You're gonna kill that.

1122
00:39:00,718 --> 00:39:02,505
No, no, you're not considering it.

1123
00:39:02,505 --> 00:39:04,243
You're gonna do it and you're gonna

1124
00:39:04,243 --> 00:39:06,993
destroy, fucking destroy it.
- So.

1125
00:39:12,244 --> 00:39:16,108
- It's less about that, it's
just about the thought of.

1126
00:39:16,108 --> 00:39:18,391
You better start fucking recording memos

1127
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:21,259
when you think about shit about
the process of making songs

1128
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:22,092
and put that shit out.

1129
00:39:22,092 --> 00:39:22,975
Just tweet it.

1130
00:39:22,975 --> 00:39:24,775
Listening to you like walking
down the street right now

1131
00:39:24,775 --> 00:39:27,013
and be like, Cleopatra but
then I'm gonna take the drums

1132
00:39:27,013 --> 00:39:29,479
and I was fucking listening
to Coldplay last night

1133
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:31,921
and that new fucking joint
and Mike Boyd said it's on,

1134
00:39:31,921 --> 00:39:33,742
there's Rap Caviar, oh shit that remind...

1135
00:39:33,742 --> 00:39:35,411
Just (makes exploding noises).

1136
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:36,514
Eight minutes and 13 seconds

1137
00:39:36,514 --> 00:39:38,950
of what's going through your dome out.

1138
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,539
(exhales)

1139
00:39:40,539 --> 00:39:42,719
By the time the song comes out?

1140
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,431
Everyone's gonna (makes
buzzing noises), you know?

1141
00:39:44,431 --> 00:39:47,472
You're gonna get them on
it before it came out.

1142
00:39:47,472 --> 00:39:48,748
My turn, my turn, ready?

1143
00:39:48,748 --> 00:39:49,933
For the culture.

1144
00:39:49,933 --> 00:39:53,782
For your culture, just put some shit out.

1145
00:39:53,782 --> 00:39:56,468
Here's my biggest problem,

1146
00:39:56,468 --> 00:39:58,823
stuff has to come out.

1147
00:39:58,823 --> 00:40:00,660
Like so many people--
- Why are we debating?

1148
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,844
- Yes!
- I mean he's mad right--

1149
00:40:02,844 --> 00:40:04,648
- I know I'm right, you know why?

1150
00:40:04,648 --> 00:40:05,992
Let's do something for
the culture right now!

1151
00:40:05,992 --> 00:40:06,825
You guys ready?

1152
00:40:06,825 --> 00:40:07,658
Like, let's fucking go!

1153
00:40:07,658 --> 00:40:09,276
Like two brown guys and a white guy.

1154
00:40:09,276 --> 00:40:11,591
(laughs)

1155
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:13,487
- Bro, he's ready to go to
Caroline's like right now.

1156
00:40:13,487 --> 00:40:14,912
- Like, right now.

1157
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,686
Like right now.

1158
00:40:16,686 --> 00:40:18,434
Like tonight I was...

1159
00:40:18,434 --> 00:40:20,188
You know, but I had the sweet chicken

1160
00:40:20,188 --> 00:40:23,170
and you know, here's what I know.

1161
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:27,103
There's so much good that
never sees the day of life.

1162
00:40:27,103 --> 00:40:27,936
The end.

1163
00:40:28,888 --> 00:40:31,796
- You what the little asterisk
I want to put on Gary's thing

1164
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:34,266
is that like do the grinding shit

1165
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:36,281
and put out your studio shit.

1166
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:37,637
- A hun, by the way,
- That's the--

1167
00:40:37,637 --> 00:40:38,845
- You know what I call high-low?

1168
00:40:38,845 --> 00:40:39,843
- But that's what we do.
- Oh.

1169
00:40:39,843 --> 00:40:41,691
- High-low.
- I missed that track.

1170
00:40:41,691 --> 00:40:43,052
I missed that track, aw man.

1171
00:40:43,052 --> 00:40:44,401
- High low.
- High low, yeah.

1172
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:46,212
- Don't do shit in the middle.

1173
00:40:46,212 --> 00:40:47,547
Do your Netflix special,

1174
00:40:47,547 --> 00:40:49,088
but you should be putting out fucking

1175
00:40:49,088 --> 00:40:51,211
a one minute video straight
to your fucking face

1176
00:40:51,211 --> 00:40:52,892
social commentating on Instagram

1177
00:40:52,892 --> 00:40:54,575
called On The Way to Work.

1178
00:40:54,575 --> 00:40:55,518
Every day.

1179
00:40:55,518 --> 00:40:56,351
I wanna hear...

1180
00:40:56,351 --> 00:40:59,286
That would be the only
thing I would consume.

1181
00:40:59,286 --> 00:41:00,954
Your hot take on the day.

1182
00:41:00,954 --> 00:41:03,501
- More about what I (mumbles).

1183
00:41:03,501 --> 00:41:04,786
- I love you, Bama.

1184
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:07,594
That's it, three second video.

1185
00:41:07,594 --> 00:41:09,426
There's just, guys, we are so lucky

1186
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:10,992
we have production companies.

1187
00:41:10,992 --> 00:41:13,326
We have production
companies and distribution

1188
00:41:13,326 --> 00:41:14,985
in our hand for free.

1189
00:41:14,985 --> 00:41:16,301
This food.

1190
00:41:16,301 --> 00:41:17,704
Do you know what fucking Prince would do

1191
00:41:17,704 --> 00:41:19,136
if this fucking existed?

1192
00:41:19,136 --> 00:41:20,886
Like are you kidding?

1193
00:41:23,545 --> 00:41:25,878
That man, that man fucking--

1194
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:30,573
- Yeah, nah, the memo shit
he said, that was wild.

1195
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:31,452
- Do you know how mad I was

1196
00:41:31,452 --> 00:41:34,193
when they found all those songs
in Prince's fucking vault?

1197
00:41:34,193 --> 00:41:35,776
Like genuinely mad?

1198
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:40,966
Those things should've
seen the light of day.

1199
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:42,457
- Yeah.

1200
00:41:42,457 --> 00:41:44,196
- Imagine, I mean, you
know how much more fun

1201
00:41:44,196 --> 00:41:46,515
it would be if we had
57 more Biggie songs?

1202
00:41:46,515 --> 00:41:47,348
- Yeah.

1203
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:51,443
- The just the biggest
thing is just like, man,

1204
00:41:51,443 --> 00:41:52,303
I don't know.

1205
00:41:52,303 --> 00:41:55,238
It's never been a better
time to be an artist

1206
00:41:55,238 --> 00:41:57,727
and, like, I still think you're buying--

1207
00:41:57,727 --> 00:41:58,869
- Bro, he's just saying

1208
00:41:58,869 --> 00:42:02,645
and I'm taking this to heart
as a comedian, max out.

1209
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,510
He's our personal trainer,
he's gonna max out.

1210
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:06,234
So I gotta max out this year.

1211
00:42:06,234 --> 00:42:10,007
So usually I can write a
new half hour, 45 minutes,

1212
00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:11,876
can I do 70?
- Yeah.

1213
00:42:11,876 --> 00:42:15,727
- Or, or, or, with the tools of the day...

1214
00:42:15,727 --> 00:42:16,880
Ready? Real quick.

1215
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,873
- Max out, bro, put some 45s on that shit.

1216
00:42:18,873 --> 00:42:20,093
- Let me just say something real quick,

1217
00:42:20,093 --> 00:42:21,867
or if the tools of the day...

1218
00:42:21,867 --> 00:42:26,200
How many hooks run through
your head in a week?

1219
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,700
Okay, cool, great.

1220
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:30,029
- Just being honest.
- No, listen,

1221
00:42:30,029 --> 00:42:32,285
I love you for that,
like this is the point.

1222
00:42:32,285 --> 00:42:35,877
My big thing is I think
we need to let people

1223
00:42:35,877 --> 00:42:37,517
into our process more

1224
00:42:37,517 --> 00:42:39,481
because if we do and we put it out

1225
00:42:39,481 --> 00:42:42,249
it may lead to the
thing we're looking for.

1226
00:42:42,249 --> 00:42:46,202
So for example, I've been
talking about Perfectly Parented,

1227
00:42:46,202 --> 00:42:49,105
the book that I've been wanting
to write for like five years

1228
00:42:49,105 --> 00:42:50,654
a rare thing for me to be...

1229
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:52,899
I believe in it so much, I'm hyping it,

1230
00:42:52,899 --> 00:42:54,718
like this fucking guy
you just told me about.

1231
00:42:54,718 --> 00:42:56,751
I feel like I'm hyping
this mystical thing,

1232
00:42:56,751 --> 00:42:58,238
I feel like by the time that
I write Perfectly Parented

1233
00:42:58,238 --> 00:43:00,050
every parent on earth is gonna buy it.

1234
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:02,581
Yet, the biggest progress I've ever made

1235
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:04,819
in Perfectly Parented was track six.

1236
00:43:04,819 --> 00:43:05,986
Was track six.

1237
00:43:07,741 --> 00:43:10,675
Was track six the fucking,
the Airplane Project.

1238
00:43:10,675 --> 00:43:12,207
Like, it's the first time I really got,

1239
00:43:12,207 --> 00:43:15,394
like I started putting some
of the parent stuff on wax.

1240
00:43:15,394 --> 00:43:16,937
I'm out.
- Alright, bro.

1241
00:43:16,937 --> 00:43:18,021
- Love you.
- Oh my god, so fast.

1242
00:43:18,021 --> 00:43:19,069
- So glad we did it.

1243
00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:20,603
So glad we did it.

1244
00:43:20,603 --> 00:43:21,789
- Yeah, I'm really glad this happened.

1245
00:43:21,789 --> 00:43:24,643
You guys got on my (mumbles).

1246
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,631
- Oh, we know how to edit this.

1247
00:43:26,631 --> 00:43:29,456
DRock knows exactly how to do it.

1248
00:43:29,456 --> 00:43:32,149
- One of these days,
I'm pulling him onstage.

1249
00:43:32,149 --> 00:43:33,834
(laughs)
It's gonna happen.

1250
00:43:33,834 --> 00:43:35,600
- And I'm saying it right now,

1251
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,460
I'm gonna fucking make people cry.

1252
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,320
They're gonna laugh so hard.

1253
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,820
One a.m., greatest night ever.

1254
00:43:43,454 --> 00:00:00,000
(chill music)
