1
00:00:00,401 --> 00:00:03,568
- Just got back to London and about to

2
00:00:05,553 --> 00:00:09,720
go into a meeting and they've
got my billboard here.

3
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:12,778
(laughs)

4
00:00:12,778 --> 00:00:14,611
- [D-Rock] Make money.

5
00:00:16,796 --> 00:00:18,063
â™« We're unstoppable

6
00:00:18,063 --> 00:00:21,063
â™« We're unstoppable

7
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:24,451
What's up vlog?

8
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:26,640
I like calling you vlog by the way.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,021
What's up vlog?

10
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:30,933
About to do an all hands
on meeting with the team

11
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:33,401
here in London, should be a lot of fun.

12
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:35,516
Give 'em a little update
on where my mind's at.

13
00:00:35,516 --> 00:00:37,127
Every time I go to the satellite offices,

14
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:38,969
it's good to get peeps together.

15
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,886
I think we've been more
disciplined here in London

16
00:00:41,886 --> 00:00:43,871
with all hands on than we've been in,

17
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:48,038
hey guys, in Chattanooga and
L.A. and I wanna fix that,

18
00:00:49,686 --> 00:00:51,012
and so let's go do that.

19
00:00:51,012 --> 00:00:54,679
(indistinguishable chatter)

20
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,596
Hey guys.

21
00:00:56,596 --> 00:00:58,231
Hi.

22
00:00:58,231 --> 00:00:59,064
Hello.

23
00:00:59,064 --> 00:01:00,075
Hey Ry.

24
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:01,826
I have a really cool
thing about selling guys,

25
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:02,949
It's what I'm good at.

26
00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:05,116
I sell things people want.

27
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:08,093
And I mean on an individual basis.

28
00:01:08,093 --> 00:01:10,984
I mean, I don't care
what Meghan or Rysa want,

29
00:01:10,984 --> 00:01:14,080
I just wanna know what it
is, and then it's my job

30
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,421
to work for all of you to
build the infrastructure

31
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:18,315
to what you want.

32
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:21,438
I don't care if you like,
if you wanna be like me,

33
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:23,762
great, work here, build leverage with me,

34
00:01:23,762 --> 00:01:26,297
and then I'll help you go do your thing.

35
00:01:26,297 --> 00:01:30,464
You wanna see every one of
your child's sporting events?

36
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:34,342
Great, make sure I know that,
and then we'll make sure

37
00:01:34,342 --> 00:01:35,950
you end up in the right
place where you have

38
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,717
enough flexibility to do that

39
00:01:37,717 --> 00:01:40,128
while making enough to
appease you financially.

40
00:01:40,128 --> 00:01:42,843
I really have no horse in the race

41
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:46,312
of what anybody wants, you or a client.

42
00:01:46,312 --> 00:01:47,314
The answer to your question is,

43
00:01:47,314 --> 00:01:48,309
what do they want?

44
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:53,028
Now, what do they want
slash what do we believe in

45
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:54,817
is the far more interesting part right?

46
00:01:54,817 --> 00:01:58,012
So they want a lot of
shit we don't believe in,

47
00:01:58,012 --> 00:02:02,225
so the question becomes we
need to stay really passionate

48
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:04,121
about what we believe in.

49
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:06,552
So for example, we could
probably be spending

50
00:02:06,552 --> 00:02:08,318
another 500 million dollars in media

51
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,123
if I was willing to waver on things

52
00:02:11,123 --> 00:02:15,156
that they want us to do
that I just don't wanna do.

53
00:02:15,156 --> 00:02:17,261
We could hire three people by print

54
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:20,461
from Group M and MediaCon, we could,

55
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:21,568
I just don't want to.

56
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,596
I think it's finding
our niche of what we do

57
00:02:24,596 --> 00:02:26,713
while deploying and executing things

58
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,866
that we're passionate
about and capable of,

59
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:31,336
whether its influencer
or marketplace social,

60
00:02:31,336 --> 00:02:33,629
things of that nature, but it starts

61
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:34,914
with knowing the reality.

62
00:02:34,914 --> 00:02:37,325
Spending 17 hours on trying to convince

63
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,966
(beep), (beep), or anybody else

64
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:43,459
to do something with us when
we could've already known

65
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:45,764
that's not gonna happen no matter what

66
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:48,094
because it's already locked
in is what I wanna do.

67
00:02:48,094 --> 00:02:51,881
We spend so many hours on
ideological points of view

68
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,356
instead of selling to the reality.

69
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:56,444
I spend no time on things
that are not sellable.

70
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:58,124
So I understand they're
your current clients

71
00:02:58,124 --> 00:02:59,462
and it's what we have to work with,

72
00:02:59,462 --> 00:03:01,942
but it's up to the account team

73
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:05,002
and to the leadership, to me, to make sure

74
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:07,061
it's even a feasible conversation,

75
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,598
'cause they'll take the meeting,

76
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:10,880
and they'll yes me to death,
and then they'll resign

77
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,713
with fuck (beep).

78
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:14,244
(indistinguishable conversation)

79
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:15,796
- Got about 10 minutes to get there.

80
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,013
- Yeah, okay.

81
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:21,180
What's your views on emerging
tech and say AR space

82
00:03:22,398 --> 00:03:23,302
at the minute?

83
00:03:23,302 --> 00:03:24,825
- Goin' into a client meeting,

84
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:26,052
but just had a really
interesting conversation.

85
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:27,433
I love people that take the initiative

86
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:30,403
to spark conversations
that are on the offense.

87
00:03:30,403 --> 00:03:31,808
I'm an offensive player.

88
00:03:31,808 --> 00:03:32,846
Fuck defense.

89
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,372
Don't worry about what
you think I care about,

90
00:03:34,372 --> 00:03:37,052
tell me what you care about
and let me react to it.

91
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:39,394
- [D-Rock] Alright now
they're going in the meeting,

92
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:41,844
I am going for a coffee shop.

93
00:03:41,844 --> 00:03:42,761
Here we go.

94
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:48,310
- Boy I wish that was filmed.

95
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,477
Big shout out to Burno Mars,
big, big, big fan Burno.

96
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,563
(crew laughs)

97
00:03:55,563 --> 00:03:56,715
Love your stuff.

98
00:03:56,715 --> 00:03:58,611
Your spam is incredible.

99
00:03:58,611 --> 00:04:02,778
Headed to a helicopter to
go do a networking speaking

100
00:04:03,856 --> 00:04:05,356
event at Facebook.

101
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:07,949
Is it at Facebook?

102
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:08,983
- [Assistant] No, it's offsite.

103
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:11,242
- Not at Facebook, but a Facebook event,

104
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:15,005
and meet some agencies,
partners and brands,

105
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,491
and so that should be good.

106
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:18,741
Then we'll helicopter back.

107
00:04:23,315 --> 00:04:24,722
This one's going there D-Rock,

108
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,679
this one was coming back.

109
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:26,738
- [D-Rock] Yeah.

110
00:04:26,738 --> 00:04:30,071
- So I get sad when peppers get crushed.

111
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:33,761
But I love peppers.

112
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:35,813
Just when they get crushed D-Rock,

113
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:37,554
I get super sad.

114
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:40,253
I try to get here once
every other month or so,

115
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:44,170
do client meetings, do
meetings with the staff.

116
00:04:45,295 --> 00:04:47,801
About to go on a helicopter,
we got a conference

117
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:49,939
with Facebook that I'm speaking at

118
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:51,366
and meeting other business partners

119
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:54,757
and other agency partners
and potential clients

120
00:04:54,757 --> 00:04:57,344
and shake a couple hands
with current clients.

121
00:04:57,344 --> 00:05:01,094
So it's usually a 24-48
hour blitz of as much

122
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:03,940
VaynerMedia stuff as possible.

123
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,591
When I get to London, it's VaynerMedia

124
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:07,375
all the way through and through.

125
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,671
- [D-Rock] In the old days we would've

126
00:05:08,671 --> 00:05:09,529
made a feature outta that.

127
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:10,660
- Yeah, not right now.

128
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,848
Too tough out there.

129
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:17,015
("She Makes me Comfortable"
by Maxwell Young)

130
00:05:31,777 --> 00:05:33,540
- [Female Interviewer] How was the flight?

131
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,641
- Flight was great.

132
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:35,961
- [Female Interviewer] Yeah, short right?

133
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,643
25 minutes?
- Awesome.

134
00:05:37,643 --> 00:05:40,392
Great flight, countryside here.

135
00:05:40,392 --> 00:05:44,228
D-Rock keepin' tabs on me, some horses,

136
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:48,365
some helicopters,
beautiful, great landing,

137
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:50,688
bunch of people with
cameras which is interesting

138
00:05:50,688 --> 00:05:51,786
in the background.

139
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:55,574
Not quite sure what's
going on, but let's go.

140
00:05:55,574 --> 00:05:59,741
("She Makes me Comfortable"
by Maxwell Young)

141
00:06:04,049 --> 00:06:06,752
About to give this talk
here at a Facebook offsite

142
00:06:06,752 --> 00:06:08,156
with a bunch of people in the industry

143
00:06:08,156 --> 00:06:10,470
and clients and potential clients,

144
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,483
and you know how I do it.

145
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:16,477
State of the union, whether
it's in a hotel in Amsterdam

146
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:18,573
or a conference center in Anaheim

147
00:06:18,573 --> 00:06:21,664
or some barn here in the
countryside of London,

148
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:24,440
wherever I need to do it, I will spin it.

149
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,916
There's a reason Woolworth's
went outta business.

150
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:30,928
There's a reason IBM is not
the consumer technology leader,

151
00:06:30,928 --> 00:06:32,222
it's all the stuff we're living through.

152
00:06:32,222 --> 00:06:34,835
I just don't think we've
grappled with how fast

153
00:06:34,835 --> 00:06:36,952
it's happening in the next 10 years.

154
00:06:36,952 --> 00:06:40,248
Listen, we always talk about,
you brought up millennials,

155
00:06:40,248 --> 00:06:41,639
it's not about millennials.

156
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,342
65 year old men sitting
next to me on flights,

157
00:06:44,342 --> 00:06:47,468
watching Star Wars on their mobile device.

158
00:06:47,468 --> 00:06:50,129
We like to say this is
our teenage children,

159
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:51,684
this is us.

160
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:52,972
There are 50 year olds in here who sent

161
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:54,430
a poop emoji last night.

162
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,623
(audience laughs)

163
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,037
This is us.

164
00:06:57,037 --> 00:06:59,368
There's not, I don't know
a single 42 year old female

165
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:02,535
that doesn't have a six
figure income in her home

166
00:07:02,535 --> 00:07:04,339
that isn't living on Instagram.

167
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:05,869
What are we talking about?

168
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:07,406
What's this future we talk about?

169
00:07:07,406 --> 00:07:10,901
You act one way when
you live your real life,

170
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:12,149
and then you have different points of view

171
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:15,649
when you put on your jersey for your firm.

172
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:18,271
That's just real.

173
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:24,777
Yeah so, vlog, I like
calling 'em vlog D-Rock,

174
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,813
vlog, I hope D-Rock caught that snippet,

175
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:30,042
and I don't know how high quality

176
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:31,658
or low quality you got it D-Rock.

177
00:07:31,658 --> 00:07:32,555
- [D-Rock] Mm-hmm.

178
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:33,618
- It's just the consumer.

179
00:07:33,618 --> 00:07:34,842
If you understand the consumer bet,

180
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:37,057
it's amazing to me that
me, with no connections,

181
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,640
no education, nothing, no money

182
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:43,237
am able to always win on the same game,

183
00:07:43,237 --> 00:07:45,539
which is complete and utter
religion of the consumer

184
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:47,722
of what I do, and then
everything works out.

185
00:07:47,722 --> 00:07:48,754
It's unbelievable.

186
00:07:48,754 --> 00:07:50,317
We have a complete disconnect.

187
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:53,464
So I would say your biggest
advantage is fresh eyes.

188
00:07:53,464 --> 00:07:55,003
If you understand the consumer,

189
00:07:55,003 --> 00:07:58,465
not the EBITDA, not who
you're gonna emanate,

190
00:07:58,465 --> 00:07:59,601
you know, you're an entrepreneur,

191
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:01,005
who you're gonna emanate to.

192
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:04,490
Three years of the actual customer

193
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,021
and that's why social is so big for me

194
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:08,598
was consumer insights that scale for free.

195
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:10,512
It just took all my time.

196
00:08:10,512 --> 00:08:13,863
15 hours a day on Twitter
and Facebook in 2006,

197
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:15,600
seven, eight, nine, just
reading every single comment

198
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,616
about every single piece of content

199
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:19,662
about every single genre,
and then you get an insight.

200
00:08:19,662 --> 00:08:21,357
And there's no quant and qual data

201
00:08:21,357 --> 00:08:23,159
that beats really putting in the work

202
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:25,794
for a considerable piece
of time in a narrow field.

203
00:08:25,794 --> 00:08:28,714
So I would just spend every waking moment

204
00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:32,350
that you can, and listen, I like the dirt.

205
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,154
So I'm empathetic to
there's different styles

206
00:08:34,154 --> 00:08:36,778
of entrepreneurship, whether it's you,

207
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:39,711
or somebody very important
that doesn't go anywhere,

208
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:41,859
a deep understanding
of the consumer insight

209
00:08:41,859 --> 00:08:42,942
that is free.

210
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:47,474
Not a company in the middle
of the fire hoses of the APIs

211
00:08:47,474 --> 00:08:49,642
analyzing it so they can make margin,

212
00:08:49,642 --> 00:08:52,594
you with them, and that's
where I think you can win.

213
00:08:52,594 --> 00:08:54,281
That's what I would do,
and that's why I always say

214
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:57,745
naive eyes, I mean I
didn't even know anything

215
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,483
about the agency world
the first four years.

216
00:08:59,483 --> 00:09:00,316
Nothing.

217
00:09:00,316 --> 00:09:02,294
I couldn't name the CEO
of Omnicom right now.

218
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:03,231
Couldn't name him.

219
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,895
- [Crew Member] Who?
- Who?

220
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:07,318
Yeah, right, so you know what I mean.

221
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:09,679
But I sure know that eight
year old girls make slime.

222
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,186
You know, all of you
give me so much credit

223
00:09:11,186 --> 00:09:12,542
for engaging and listening
and being with you,

224
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:15,527
but you've given me so much
more than I'm giving you

225
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:17,149
because you're the punch line.

226
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:18,530
It's all consumer focus.

227
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,015
The reason I don't pay
attention to my competition

228
00:09:20,015 --> 00:09:21,911
is not 'cause I'm brash or cool,

229
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:23,507
'cause it doesn't fuckin'
matter when you're

230
00:09:23,507 --> 00:09:24,804
obsessed with the end consumer.

231
00:09:24,804 --> 00:09:26,883
Bring them you, why do
you think I'm asking you

232
00:09:26,883 --> 00:09:28,198
if two channels works?

233
00:09:28,198 --> 00:09:30,055
Because I need to give you what you want.

234
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:31,545
Everybody talks about well, if you listen

235
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:32,979
to the consumer this, yes of course.

236
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:34,996
You can't only be about
what the consumer is.

237
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:36,529
You have to go through your lens,

238
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:38,408
but it starts and it ends with you guys,

239
00:09:38,408 --> 00:09:40,915
and I will always do actions
that bring you the most value

240
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:43,656
because then I get value in return.

241
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:47,406
51, 49, that's the
fuckin' game 'til the end.

242
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:50,485
Biggest companies in the world,

243
00:09:50,485 --> 00:09:52,182
and for us little entrepreneurs.

("She Makes me Comfortable"

245
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,914
Just got back to London and about to

246
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:23,879
go into a meeting, and
they've got my billboard here.

247
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:27,536

("She Makes me Comfortable"

It's goin' really well.

251
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,801
It's goin' really well.

252
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:43,513
I mean look, I'm trying
to build a platform

253
00:10:43,513 --> 00:10:45,081
for my future business behavior.

254
00:10:45,081 --> 00:10:48,338
The key is building ninjas
who don't get romantic

255
00:10:48,338 --> 00:10:52,017
about anything other
than consumer attention.

256
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:54,816
And the contextual creative
that makes them do something.

257
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:56,797
- [Interviewer] That is the dream.

258
00:10:56,797 --> 00:10:58,576
- So what's interesting is we're building,

259
00:10:58,576 --> 00:11:01,775
but by the time we buy Peroni,
it might be Alexa voice,

260
00:11:01,775 --> 00:11:04,094
it might be AR, it might be some device

261
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:06,554
that two girls in Chelsea are inventing

262
00:11:06,554 --> 00:11:07,723
right now in their basement.

263
00:11:07,723 --> 00:11:11,438
So where my challenge is
for the people at Vayner

264
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,109
is for them to understand
that if I started

265
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:16,359
Vayner today, we would be a voice shop.

266
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:18,624
- [Interviewer] I heard you say that.

267
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:21,122
- You know, and so, that's
the interesting thing

268
00:11:21,122 --> 00:11:21,991
to navigate the company.

269
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:22,974
I think I've done a much better job

270
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:26,002
in the last year, I think
compared to 18 months ago,

271
00:11:26,002 --> 00:11:27,317
I think everybody
understands, okay we're not

272
00:11:27,317 --> 00:11:28,873
a social media shop.

273
00:11:28,873 --> 00:11:30,409
Then there's plenty of
people that think we are,

274
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:32,021
but 18 months ago I
think everybody thought

275
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:33,599
that's what we were,
and now I think people

276
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:34,747
are like, oh okay.

277
00:11:34,747 --> 00:11:36,367
- [Interviewer] No, I
think people at least...

00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:40,534
("She Makes me Comfortable"
by Maxwell Young)

279
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,871
- Just got off a call, gave some real

280
00:11:57,871 --> 00:11:59,943
hardcore feedback to the team

281
00:11:59,943 --> 00:12:02,796
on my insights and how we
pitch and position VaynerMedia.

282
00:12:02,796 --> 00:12:04,106
At some level that's my responsibility

283
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:06,254
of structuring and positioning our shop

284
00:12:06,254 --> 00:12:10,264
in the right way, and
so that was super good.

285
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:11,544
Felt good about it.

286
00:12:11,544 --> 00:12:12,636
I had a bunch of leaders on the call

287
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:14,530
that I thought got what I was saying,

288
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,529
and I think it's gonna
be disproportionately

289
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,233
fruitful for Vayner going forward.

290
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:22,370
So really productive 20 minute call here

291
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,629
in the middle of the
street at 11 p.m. in London

292
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:26,790
is a call that is gonna move the business.

293
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,790
And I think more leaders
need to get into the dirt

294
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,060
to have these impact moments
to build their businesses,

295
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,833
especially when you're
running a big company.

296
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:35,964

this journey as a talent

00:12:56,528 --> 00:13:00,390
is the bubble was this
big of what I could do,

doin' this, I'm doin' this.

even thought about that.
