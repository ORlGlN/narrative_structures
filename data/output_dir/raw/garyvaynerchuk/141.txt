1
00:00:00,114 --> 00:00:01,118
- If I did what most people did,

2
00:00:01,118 --> 00:00:02,748
I wouldn't have had the money,

3
00:00:02,748 --> 00:00:03,886
because I didn't make that much money,

4
00:00:03,886 --> 00:00:05,373
to invest in Twitter and Facebook.

5
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:07,881
I wouldn't have had it.

6
00:00:07,881 --> 00:00:11,485
I would have had 25 pairs
of Nikes and a Mercedes.

7
00:00:11,485 --> 00:00:15,152
(lighthearted guitar music)

8
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:26,703
- Fantastic. It's so nice to meet you.

9
00:00:26,703 --> 00:00:28,762
- Nice to meet you. Hello. How are you?

10
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,777
- Hi, I'm fine.
- She's my wife, Aicha.

11
00:00:30,777 --> 00:00:31,877
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

12
00:00:31,877 --> 00:00:33,276
- Good. How's your day?

13
00:00:33,276 --> 00:00:34,234
- It's good.
- Good.

14
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:37,990
- Twelve o'clock, midnight, I
believe I messaged, mailed you

15
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,823
on all the new ideas that I've got

16
00:00:43,306 --> 00:00:46,577
And I thought this is the
best time to meet you,

17
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:49,955
and discuss the challenges,
which I feel gets

18
00:00:49,955 --> 00:00:52,455
your peace of mind in terms of

19
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,640
how you see sales.

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,640
I know by how your sales guy, right?

21
00:00:59,244 --> 00:01:03,302
And there is so much going
on in the market right now.

22
00:01:03,302 --> 00:01:06,882
And to be relevant in the next five years,

23
00:01:06,882 --> 00:01:11,504
and I'm selling technology,
which basically means that

24
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:14,303
it's gonna be an
interesting journey for me.

25
00:01:14,303 --> 00:01:16,288
Especially with the AI
coming into the picture

26
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,297
and machine learning and everything.

27
00:01:17,297 --> 00:01:18,130
- Yes.

28
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:21,053
- So, I don't know--

29
00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:22,317
- Well first off, let's start backwards.

30
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:23,848
The machine learning and
AI thing's very important

31
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:26,215
because anytime there's new technologies

32
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:29,194
that people think are
going to replace humans,

33
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:33,293
it always takes so much
longer than people think.

34
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,534
Like the thought that

35
00:01:34,534 --> 00:01:38,106
machines are gonna replace sales people

36
00:01:38,106 --> 00:01:40,114
in the next decade,

37
00:01:40,114 --> 00:01:41,966
is virtually impossible.

38
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:42,966
- Certainly.

39
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:45,966
- Do you know how much has to happen

40
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:47,735
for that to be a reality?

41
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:50,235
Including, the social aspects,

42
00:01:51,975 --> 00:01:52,900
like human,

43
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,792
where technologists get confused

44
00:01:55,792 --> 00:01:59,855
is the technology is there,
but the adoption isn't.

45
00:01:59,855 --> 00:02:00,688
- Sure.

46
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:02,411
- Because the adoption's emotional.

47
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:03,244
- Right.

48
00:02:03,244 --> 00:02:06,901
- Taking the risk to fire
half your sales staff

49
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:08,142
to let machines

50
00:02:08,142 --> 00:02:10,413
Here's what doesn't work.

51
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:13,440
Being a salesperson who
spends their entire day

52
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,609
cold-emailing people on LinkedIn

53
00:02:16,609 --> 00:02:18,947
is probably a vulnerable skill.

54
00:02:18,947 --> 00:02:19,920
- Too easy.

55
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,019
- Because a machine can do that.

56
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:22,916
- Absolutely.

57
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,045
- Going and golfing, or
having a glass of wine

58
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,596
or building relationships as a salesperson

59
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:29,704
is not something a
machine's replacing anytime,

60
00:02:29,704 --> 00:02:33,085
and that is where most
of the magic is in sales.

61
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:35,065
Having good product, knowing your product,

62
00:02:35,065 --> 00:02:37,422
and then building an actual relationship

63
00:02:37,422 --> 00:02:41,713
where people trade on
humanity, not on data.

64
00:02:41,713 --> 00:02:44,089
So I think sales is going to be

65
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:47,284
a very, very down the long line thing

66
00:02:47,284 --> 00:02:50,700
that's disrupted by technology itself.

67
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,390
Now selling technology's interesting

68
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,540
because sometimes your
product becomes irrelevant,

69
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,629
and you're selling something
you don't believe in.

70
00:02:58,629 --> 00:02:59,462
- True.

71
00:02:59,462 --> 00:03:00,295
- That, to me, is the biggest fear.

72
00:03:00,295 --> 00:03:01,128
That's why, if you've noticed,

73
00:03:01,128 --> 00:03:03,153
because it sounds like
you're into my content,

74
00:03:03,153 --> 00:03:04,866
I've been spending more time talking about

75
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:07,073
selling stuff you believe in.
- True.

76
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:09,248
- I have sales people selling me stuff,

77
00:03:09,248 --> 00:03:12,037
I ask one question, and they break.

78
00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:14,799
And they break because they
already know they're in trouble

79
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:17,484
because they think I'm
smart, or know I'm smart.

80
00:03:17,484 --> 00:03:19,454
And two, they get exposed for selling

81
00:03:19,454 --> 00:03:20,772
something they don't believe in.

82
00:03:20,772 --> 00:03:21,605
- True.

83
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:23,366
- But they've been
doing it for nine years,

84
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:26,122
and they know the product,
but the market moved.

85
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,945
I don't sell social media at VaynerMedia.

86
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:31,107
I sell attention.

87
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:32,760
- So I'm not pushing Twitter and Facebook,

88
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,840
I'm pushing whatever I
believe has the attention

89
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,089
at an under-priced level.

90
00:03:37,089 --> 00:03:40,101
So, for me, it's always gonna
be easy to sell VaynerMedia

91
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:43,268
because I'm not tied down to anything.

92
00:03:44,618 --> 00:03:46,638
And so that's where it gets tough.

93
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:48,699
I have the luxury of driving the company

94
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:52,326
toward products and
features and things to sell

95
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:54,120
that are relevant.

96
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,528
When you work somewhere,

97
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:58,856
if you're company doesn't
do that, you're stuck.

98
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:01,255
If you're selling desktop computers,

99
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:03,201
if you're competing with Amazon Cloud,

100
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,811
if there's been a SAS
product that's been released,

101
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:08,805
and you're building enterprise websites,

102
00:04:08,805 --> 00:04:10,190
and you're competing against Squarespace

103
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,402
or WordPress or Shopify,
or Magento, that's tough.

104
00:04:14,402 --> 00:04:15,235
- True.

105
00:04:15,235 --> 00:04:17,308
- So I think the biggest
thing that I would say is

106
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:18,666
make sure you're never in a position

107
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,863
where you're not selling
something you believe in.

108
00:04:21,863 --> 00:04:23,584
That's what's tough.
- Right.

109
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:26,672
- And so what that requires
is having your feet

110
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:30,293
in the business that you
do but your head in...

111
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:33,841
So I think of it as feet, head, and heart.

112
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:36,389
My head is always looking
at where I'm going,

113
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:39,004
my feet are always where I have to be,

114
00:04:39,004 --> 00:04:41,465
and I try to hope that I can have my heart

115
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:43,478
match with my head.

116
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:44,919
- Because if you're heart
and head are matched,

117
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:45,752
you have a big chance of winning.

118
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,956
If you love it, and you know it's smart--

119
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,788
- Automatically you're passionate
about what you're selling.

120
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:52,038
- Hundred percent.

121
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:54,821
All of a sudden, when you're
heart is leading your head

122
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:56,920
instead of your head to your heart,

123
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,236
you are putting your, you know..

124
00:04:58,236 --> 00:05:01,403
This is why I always try to
get people to change jobs.

125
00:05:01,403 --> 00:05:03,461
Because I tell them,
"Start with your heart,

126
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:05,581
"take a little less money"

127
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:09,497
But if you love East sports,
if you love video games,

128
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:11,570
well that's heart.
- Right.

129
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,697
- If you use your head, you're like,

130
00:05:12,697 --> 00:05:14,587
"East sports is growing."
- Right.

131
00:05:14,587 --> 00:05:15,858
- That's great.

132
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,525
If your heart is in typewriting,

133
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:21,979
your head is gonna say, "No, that's not

134
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:25,526
"where the world's going., Now
you have to make a decision.

135
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:26,359
- True.

136
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,242
- Right? But I'm much
happier with the person

137
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:30,373
that goes with their
heart and does typewriting

138
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:31,632
and lives a more humble life,

139
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,538
than what I think most people do,

140
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:35,540
which is they go with their heart, head,

141
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,147
which is a lot of times is
attached to their pocket.

142
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:40,077
But their heart's not in it.

143
00:05:40,077 --> 00:05:40,910
- Sure.

144
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,551
- And then they live that
life that so many people live

145
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,551
that is the worst life,
which is you're stuck

146
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:48,461
paying your mortgage and your bills

147
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:51,245
and taking care of your
family, but you're miserable

148
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:53,995
40 to 70 hours a week, minimally.

149
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:59,556
And then in your head, you're
miserable 144 hours a week.

150
00:05:59,556 --> 00:06:01,949
- True. Can I--
- Yes.

151
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:04,633
- I was watching on a few videos and,

152
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:05,848
I think I saw you in Mumbai.

153
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:06,681
- Yes.

154
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:08,181
- Nine years back?

155
00:06:09,476 --> 00:06:12,405
And I was just seeing the
number of views on that.

156
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,780
There were around 700 views.

157
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,417
At that time, probably
it was around 200 views.

158
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:20,751
Probably 500 views added in
the last three, four years.

159
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:21,918
- Makes sense.

160
00:06:23,152 --> 00:06:25,720
- It must have been a
difficult journey for you.

161
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,784
- Not really because I love the journey

162
00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:29,902
more than the results.

163
00:06:29,902 --> 00:06:32,086
My friend, I like it better
when I have 200 views.

164
00:06:32,086 --> 00:06:34,919
I don't like what's happening now.

165
00:06:37,057 --> 00:06:39,340
- That's the fundamental difference.

166
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,286
You want to know what the difference is?

167
00:06:41,286 --> 00:06:44,274
That question and that answer.

168
00:06:44,274 --> 00:06:46,769
My favorite times is when
nobody knows who I am

169
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:50,852
and when I'm struggling
because I love that part.

170
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,141
- True.

171
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:53,974
- If you notice,

172
00:06:53,974 --> 00:06:55,409
when I started winning
in the wine business,

173
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:56,634
I went into this business.

174
00:06:56,634 --> 00:06:59,335
My friend, listen, I think
I'm about 36 months away

175
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,343
from doing something drastic

176
00:07:00,343 --> 00:07:01,876
and doing something completely different

177
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:03,212
that people are gonna tell me...

178
00:07:03,212 --> 00:07:06,279
The problem is this
chapter elevated me so much

179
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,735
that I'm worried that the next
thing, I'm already gonna...

180
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:10,560
People are just gonna
say, "He's gonna win."

181
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,998
I prefer the negative.

182
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:15,431
I might move to Mumbai
where nobody knows me

183
00:07:15,431 --> 00:07:17,765
just to have that feeling.

184
00:07:17,765 --> 00:07:20,763
It wasn't difficult, it
wasn't difficult at all.

185
00:07:20,763 --> 00:07:22,333
And that's what I'm
trying to push people for.

186
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,093
When you love it, when it's
your heart driving you,

187
00:07:25,093 --> 00:07:26,334
it's the most fun.

188
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:27,167
It's liberating.

189
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:28,164
- True.

190
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:31,606
- Like as long as you're paying
for your family's existence,

191
00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:35,919
and to me, that could be
as simple as roof and food,

192
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,942
people get too fancy.

193
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:40,531
They buy an expensive
car and a second home

194
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:43,450
and now they're stuck
because they have a mortgage

195
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,796
and they have to pay for those things.

196
00:07:45,796 --> 00:07:48,046
No, I'm glad you asked that question next

197
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:50,462
because it allowed me to
really make you understand.

198
00:07:50,462 --> 00:07:51,295
- Right.

199
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,691
- The only part I like is the struggle.

200
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:55,357
I don't like the admiration.

201
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:57,155
I mean, look, this feels
incredible for people

202
00:07:57,155 --> 00:07:58,520
to feel like you're helping them,

203
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,367
but the reason I want admiration and fame

204
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:03,867
is because I think I can help.

205
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:07,560
It's a sense of
responsibility, it is not a...

206
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,532
To me, it is... I'm not doing
what I'm doing right now

207
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,382
out of the narcissistic vanity reasons.

208
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:15,593
I'm doing it out of a
sense of responsibility,

209
00:08:15,593 --> 00:08:18,944
which is I have an ability
to connect with people,

210
00:08:18,944 --> 00:08:20,055
and if they connect with me,

211
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:23,307
I'm gonna teach them very good values.

212
00:08:23,307 --> 00:08:25,457
And for me, especially,
it skews young male,

213
00:08:25,457 --> 00:08:30,209
and young males can go down
a very bad path very quickly.

214
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,860
And so if I can get them, I
still have that star power

215
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,917
to get them attracted and they like it,

216
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:37,417
and it's macho and it's alpha,

217
00:08:38,254 --> 00:08:40,765
but underneath my facade is a purity

218
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:43,418
that most of my competitors
don't play with.

219
00:08:43,418 --> 00:08:46,521
And I feel like that is my
greatest impact on society.

220
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:49,839
Like if I can do this
for the next 40-50 years,

221
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,808
if I can impact a generation of young men

222
00:08:52,808 --> 00:08:56,735
to do good things, I
could have a real impact.

223
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:57,568
- So true.

224
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:01,010
I'm leaving on 26th.

225
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,810
I wish I could get a chance
to visit the Synergy Global.

226
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,497
- Next weekend. It's a big event.

227
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:09,735
- Big event.

228
00:09:09,735 --> 00:09:11,854
- Big games, yeah.

229
00:09:11,854 --> 00:09:14,362
- So long back my brother
gifted me this book

230
00:09:14,362 --> 00:09:17,276
for disciplines of execution.

231
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:18,235
I'm big on execution.

232
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:20,318
I'm very bad at strategy.

233
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,390
That's unfamiliar.

234
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:25,947
What I feel is

235
00:09:25,947 --> 00:09:30,125
I can work towards things,
and that the reason--

236
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,250
- By the way, I apologize to cut you off.

237
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,208
- Sure.

238
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,922
- Self-awareness is the ultimate strategy.

239
00:09:36,922 --> 00:09:39,628
It's funny to hear you
say, "I'm bad at strategy,"

240
00:09:39,628 --> 00:09:41,237
and I'm bad at plenty of things.

241
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:42,729
You're bad at micro-strategy.

242
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:44,188
The fact that you even know that

243
00:09:44,188 --> 00:09:46,063
means that you're winning
the most important

244
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:47,980
strategy game there is.

245
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:51,467
Strategy is an insight,

246
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:54,254
if we don't have insights
on ourself and who we are,

247
00:09:54,254 --> 00:09:57,146
we can't put ourselves
in a position to succeed.

248
00:09:57,146 --> 00:10:00,392
So you might be bad at
some micro-strategy,

249
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,236
but the fact that you even understand that

250
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:04,876
means that you're winning
the macro-strategy game.

251
00:10:04,876 --> 00:10:06,793
And that's the unlocks.

252
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:10,355
- I'm taking up an
interesting assignment now,

253
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:12,377
it's gonna be in Australia,

254
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:16,544
so it's a different world
altogether for me for my wife.

255
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:18,681
- You guys are gonna move?
- Yep!

256
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:20,070
- Congratulations!

257
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,189
- Yeah, so that's gonna be--

258
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:22,629
- What city?
- I'm sorry?

259
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:23,754
- What city?
- Sydney.

260
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:24,864
- Sydney. You've been before?

261
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:25,697
- No

262
00:10:25,697 --> 00:10:28,329
- It's amazing, it's an amazing city.

263
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:29,860
How long you gonna be there?

264
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,052
- I don't know, probably
three, four years.

265
00:10:33,052 --> 00:10:34,305
- You excited or you gonna miss home?

266
00:10:34,305 --> 00:10:37,857
- Yeah, I'm excited
- Good. Good. Awesome.

267
00:10:37,857 --> 00:10:39,324
I'm gonna be in Sydney in a week or two.

268
00:10:39,324 --> 00:10:41,516
- Oh, nice.
- Yep.

269
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:42,349
- So I have to be there--

270
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:44,231
- So what are you gonna sell?

271
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:46,771
- I'm responsible for Orko Technologies,

272
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:50,665
database, software--
- Yep, I know it.

273
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:54,832
- Orko itself is transforming
right now, it's huge company,

274
00:10:56,918 --> 00:10:59,083
and they now entered advertisement,

275
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:02,666
now they have a social
presence themselves.

276
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:06,903
So for me it's gonna be very interesting

277
00:11:06,903 --> 00:11:11,624
because we are getting into a
different market altogether--

278
00:11:11,624 --> 00:11:13,917
- You are going down.

279
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:16,195
- We were always working with
the Fortune 500 companies,

280
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:20,677
and now we are talking to
startups, getting them on board,

281
00:11:20,677 --> 00:11:23,631
and having them understand
all the technology.

282
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:25,714
And all this is exciting,

283
00:11:27,735 --> 00:11:30,364
but one question which I had in my mind,

284
00:11:30,364 --> 00:11:32,289
which I really wanted to ask you is,

285
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:34,956
see, I'm very high on ambition--

286
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,280
- Okay, how is your patience?

287
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:41,098
- I'm patient--

288
00:11:41,098 --> 00:11:42,722
- That's good, how old are you?

289
00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:44,728
- I'm 29--
- Baby.

290
00:11:44,728 --> 00:11:47,568
- I'm turning 30 in December
- Okay.

291
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:50,009
- But what I feel is that,

292
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:54,176
at the same time I wanna be
switched with myself, in 40s.

293
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,553
I don't know why do I have this fantasy

294
00:11:57,553 --> 00:12:01,325
of not working full time
job, or a business--

295
00:12:01,325 --> 00:12:02,408
- It's great.

296
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,160
You guys gonna start, you have a family

297
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,993
or you gonna start a family?

298
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:07,013
- We wanna start a family.

299
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:09,660
- I mean, maybe that's why,
there's a million reasons why.

300
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,493
Why not?

301
00:12:13,872 --> 00:12:15,882
So what's the question?

302
00:12:15,882 --> 00:12:18,934
- I don't know if I should
go all into my ambitions--

303
00:12:18,934 --> 00:12:20,259
- Of course you should,

304
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:24,092
but it doesn't mean you
need to quit your job.

305
00:12:25,385 --> 00:12:27,600
All into your ambitions
may look like this,

306
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,277
I'm gonna work really great
at Orko for the next 10 years,

307
00:12:30,277 --> 00:12:31,590
and you gonna look at your wife and say,

308
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,680
"Okay, and we are gonna be smart,

309
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,411
"and we are gonna save
even more than normal,

310
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:38,618
"we are gonna live even more humbly,

311
00:12:38,618 --> 00:12:41,215
"because what do we need?"

312
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:45,295
and that's gonna allow us
to save 5,000 10,000 50,000.

313
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:46,246
I don't know your business,

314
00:12:46,246 --> 00:12:47,923
I don't need to know your business,

315
00:12:47,923 --> 00:12:51,756
but if you save even
$10,000 for over 10 years

316
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:55,852
that you would've just spent on dumb shit,

317
00:12:55,852 --> 00:12:57,688
that's a $100,000.

318
00:12:57,688 --> 00:13:00,996
That's enough to start a small business.

319
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:04,496
People don't get caught up in the numbers,

320
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:08,275
get caught up in the game.

321
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:11,700
You know, just back to that
last answer I gave you,

322
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,958
if your ambition is to work for yourself,

323
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,967
there is a very big difference
between working for yourself

324
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:18,434
and working for yourself and
making $40 million a year.

325
00:13:18,434 --> 00:13:19,517
- Right

326
00:13:19,517 --> 00:13:23,117
- You can work for yourself,
they can work for themselves,

327
00:13:23,117 --> 00:13:25,307
at a very low number.

328
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:26,140
You could.

329
00:13:27,512 --> 00:13:30,012
It's keeping things in budget.

330
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,986
You need to decide what you guys need.

331
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:33,819
- True

332
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:37,993
Now listen, I would
argue a lot of families

333
00:13:37,993 --> 00:13:42,756
need two very nice
vacations, I understand that.

334
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:45,618
Somebody may need a fancy
car because they are insecure

335
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:48,927
and that makes them feel
good, I'm okay with anything.

336
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:52,520
I just think you don't need
everything you think you need.

337
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,804
To me it's now about being,
making $400,000 a year

338
00:13:55,804 --> 00:13:58,709
and living in a studio like you are poor.

339
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:01,455
But it is looking at
what, $220,000 a year,

340
00:14:01,455 --> 00:14:05,622
and making salary like that,
and living like it's 150.

341
00:14:06,587 --> 00:14:09,670
Or making 87 and living like it's 62.

342
00:14:11,213 --> 00:14:13,112
Do you know what most people do?

343
00:14:13,112 --> 00:14:15,631
They make a 115 and live like it's 200,

344
00:14:15,631 --> 00:14:17,553
and then debt them whole way through.

345
00:14:17,553 --> 00:14:19,074
For what?

346
00:14:19,074 --> 00:14:21,470
To look cool with everybody else?

347
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,387
- You know what's happening inside?

348
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:30,423
- And that's not even factoring
in if economy gets bad.

349
00:14:30,423 --> 00:14:31,674
Do you know what happens to people

350
00:14:31,674 --> 00:14:35,053
when they make $125,000 a year
and live like it's $200,000

351
00:14:35,053 --> 00:14:36,868
when the economy goes bad?

352
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:37,967
- It's truly bad.

353
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:39,857
- Yeah, we've been living
a very long time now

354
00:14:39,857 --> 00:14:41,745
and you guys haven't even
felt the bad economy.

355
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:42,763
Globally.

356
00:14:42,763 --> 00:14:43,596
- 2008

357
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:46,338
- Right, you were a baby.

358
00:14:46,338 --> 00:14:48,388
- I started working at 18
- Right

359
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,108
- Which is very rare in India.

360
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:52,763
- So, I don't know,

361
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:55,360
and just even looking at
your body language like,

362
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,868
I just don't don't
think you need anything.

363
00:14:56,868 --> 00:14:59,785
I wish I documented my 20s and 30s,

364
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,229
I was 36 years old, renting,

365
00:15:07,229 --> 00:15:09,896
renting a two bedroom apartment.

366
00:15:11,816 --> 00:15:13,233
- At 36?
- At 36.

367
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:17,121
- And I believe that was--

368
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:19,556
- If I did what most people
did, I wouldn't have the money,

369
00:15:19,556 --> 00:15:20,750
because I didn't make that much money,

370
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,832
to invest in Twitter and
Facebook, I wouldn't have had it.

371
00:15:24,832 --> 00:15:28,999
- I would've had 25 pairs
of Nikes and a Mercedes.

372
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:32,294
- And that changed your life as well.

373
00:15:32,294 --> 00:15:35,027
- And that changed my life at some level,

374
00:15:35,027 --> 00:15:36,609
but really never, it didn't.

375
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:38,355
You know what's funny,
if I'm being serious,

376
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,416
it didn't change my life,

377
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:43,271
I'm still sitting with all the equity.

378
00:15:43,271 --> 00:15:45,733
I mean I sold Twitter, but..

379
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:47,076
I gotta go I know, I gotta catch a flight,

380
00:15:47,076 --> 00:15:48,876
I gotta go to Singapore,

381
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:50,462
but I wanted to sneak in this meeting.

382
00:15:50,462 --> 00:15:51,295
- Thank you so much--

383
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,249
- It's such a pleasure,

384
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:53,712
I hope you got some value out of it.

385
00:15:53,712 --> 00:15:55,708
- Oh I did, definitely.

386
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:56,887
- Good, awesome!

387
00:15:56,887 --> 00:15:59,327
- I really really really
really really really

388
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:01,745
hope you listen to every
work of that meeting.

389
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:04,520
I could tell by Derox's reaction

390
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,772
there was some good stuff going on,

391
00:16:05,772 --> 00:16:08,033
so advice I'm giving this lovely couple

392
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,171
is probably the advice
that 95% of you needed,

393
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:12,106
so I hope you enjoy it.

394
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:14,689
- Thank you so much.
- Bye guys.

395
00:16:17,282 --> 00:16:21,115
(dramatic instrumental music)

396
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:38,516
- Quick words of wisdom, self-awareness,

397
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:42,693
empathy, gratitude, these
very tried and true attributes

398
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:45,326
that are absolutely the drive of success

399
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:48,667
in today's environment, straight up.

400
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:52,584
- Alright vlog, heading
to Hong Kong right now,

401
00:16:54,227 --> 00:16:56,694
then connecting going to Singapore.

402
00:16:56,694 --> 00:16:57,919
Just did a live stream

403
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,523
cut some from that, just super
excited, lots of good stuff.

404
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:05,597
VaynerMedia, just rolling last month,

405
00:17:05,597 --> 00:17:07,872
Vayner staff selling content,

406
00:17:07,872 --> 00:17:10,121
we are still not there,
but we will get there.

407
00:17:10,121 --> 00:17:11,613
We will get there.

408
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,479
See ya.

409
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:15,062
(upbeat music)

410
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,468
- I gotta bounce.

411
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:24,744
I love you guys, I hope
you have the best day

412
00:17:24,744 --> 00:00:00,000
of your fucking life.
