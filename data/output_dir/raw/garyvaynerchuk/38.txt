1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,030
- Hey vlog, did you capture that footage?

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,230
Whenever you cut capture, just run it.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,157
Vlog, I just tore my ACL I think.

4
00:00:07,157 --> 00:00:09,324
(hip hop)

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,340
So, but yeah it's the fifth book.

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,330
I'm excited about it.

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,430
Crush It was the biggest book I wrote.

8
00:00:30,472 --> 00:00:32,450
The first one, so this
is the follow up to it.

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,840
- After the wine book.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,710
- Yeah, exactly.

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,926
This is the follow up to it,

12
00:00:35,926 --> 00:00:38,077
and it's just super relvant,

13
00:00:38,077 --> 00:00:41,002
it's basically like the first several,

14
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:43,820
the first kind of part of it,

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,420
part one is like, just complete mindset,

16
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,121
like fuck man, like do you understand

17
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:52,428
that if you have $413,000 in college debt,

18
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:55,550
come from alcoholic parents,

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,630
and work at Saks Fifth Avenue,

20
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,320
that's still, at 7:30 when
you get home from your

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,950
fuckin' hour and a half commute,

22
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,427
still you can take your fuckin' phone out

23
00:01:04,427 --> 00:01:06,600
and do damage for five hours,

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,879
and over the course of six years,

25
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:11,430
turn around that ridiculously
impossible narrative

26
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,670
that you're stuck in,

27
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,850
the fact that that's
true is batshit crazy.

28
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:15,850
- Yeah.

29
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:16,840
- When I wrote the first one,

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,660
people were like, what? Go on YouTube?

31
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,550
Make a living? Wait, what?
Be the king of honey?

32
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,640
And make 90,000 a year
instead of making 72?

33
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,000
I think you and I are anomalies.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,190
I do not think that somebody
in Cincinnati right now

35
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,760
who makes 47k, working retail,

36
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,474
can't make 51 being the
biggest expert on Star Trek.

37
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,780
I don't think people
understand the long tail.

38
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,613
- Sure.

39
00:01:42,613 --> 00:01:44,190
- That's a big fuckin' deal.

40
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,429
The variable difference of happiness of

41
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:49,900
making 81k in upper
management and something

42
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,000
that makes you miserable,

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,840
versus making 64, talking
about whiffle ball all day,

44
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,470
is a big deal.

45
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,030
To me, it's just about happiness.

46
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,377
And I just think that a lot of people

47
00:01:59,377 --> 00:02:02,730
don't realize how much they
know about a very narrow niche

48
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,650
that also has a ton of other
people that are into it,

49
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,050
and if they understand
how to use Instagram,

50
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,411
YouTube, Facebook and podcasting,

51
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:11,670
they just can't understand
how much money there is.

52
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:38,170
Heading upstairs to a meeting,

53
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,810
it's always fun when you have a client or

54
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,228
potential client within your own building.

55
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:44,909
- I think I need to kind of figure out --

56
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:45,750
- What?

57
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,770
- That the world I wanna
go into is so huge,

58
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,890
and it's getting really cluttered,

59
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,263
and it's getting really inauthentic.

60
00:02:51,263 --> 00:02:54,060
- Can I give you a quick piece of advice?

61
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,893
- Please.

62
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:55,727
- Every world is like that.

63
00:02:55,727 --> 00:02:56,570
- Yeah.

64
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,600
- Don't let that cripple you.

65
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,433
- Yeah.

66
00:02:58,433 --> 00:03:00,150
- And go narrow to what makes you pop.

67
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,030
- Right.

68
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,260
- Motivational speakers
are my most hated people.

69
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,410
- You mean by other people?

70
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,243
- I hate them.

71
00:03:06,243 --> 00:03:09,010
Yet, I get categorized in
that world all the time.

72
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:09,843
- Right.

73
00:03:09,843 --> 00:03:11,620
- But I'm not crippled
because I know that I'm not

74
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,670
trying to do the wrong thing.

75
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,760
- Right. Or you're not
trying to do whatever --

76
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,593
- The wrong thing.

77
00:03:16,593 --> 00:03:18,329
Forget about that.

78
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:19,162
- Yeah.

79
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:23,010
- Don't ever look for the
white space that doesn't exist.

80
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,180
- Mm hmm, yeah. Just like make it --

81
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,820
- Do what the fuck you know --

82
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,860
if you know yoga, yoga's
plenty fuckin', ya know?

83
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,693
- Yeah.

84
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:34,430
- Be in "the cream rises
to the top" business,

85
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,310
not in the "I'm gonna see
something nobody else sees"

86
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,143
business.

87
00:03:38,143 --> 00:03:40,340
So all the people that
are doing the wrong thing,

88
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,230
crowded, not authentic, it just
has nothing to do with you.

89
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,604
I'm not crippled by
other agencies sucking at

90
00:03:45,604 --> 00:03:47,660
giving a fuck about people.

91
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,440
- Yeah, if you were, you
wouldn't be where you are.

92
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,260
- That's the thing you need to do.

93
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,010
- A lot of people are like,
"You know, what you're doing

94
00:03:57,336 --> 00:03:58,380
it's kind of risky," and like --

95
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,213
- Risky for what?

96
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:01,060
- I dunno, I just don't
believe in this whole notion of

97
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,851
like, okay you graduate, then you work --

98
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:06,710
- You can come back and
work here, the same spot.

99
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,050
- Yeah, I also just don't --

100
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,031
- I actually think the other way is risky.

101
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:12,310
- Me too because I think it's really easy

102
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,360
to become complacent.

103
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,453
- 100%.

104
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:17,620
- And I don't, I dunno.

105
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,529
I don't think it's deviating from a path,

106
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,339
because I don't think
that there is a path.

107
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,093
- There's way too much respect for

108
00:04:23,093 --> 00:04:25,500
anybody who thinks what
you're doing is risky.

109
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,630
- Yeah, I mean I've literally
gotten that response from

110
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,953
one person, but my family is like,

111
00:04:28,953 --> 00:04:31,717
yes, 100%, go, they're so --

112
00:04:31,717 --> 00:04:34,798
- And the person that's saying that

113
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:38,300
respects a certain narrative
and that's awesome too.

114
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,810
- Right, and that's great for them.

115
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,055
- It may be great for
them forever. Yeah, maybe.

116
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:45,470
Going with Ryan Harwood
right here, CEO of PureWow.

117
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,117
Very smart and handsome.

118
00:04:47,117 --> 00:04:49,709
Going to see a potential
client for PureWow.

119
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:50,760
VaynerX baby.

120
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,593
- Let's rock it.

121
00:04:51,593 --> 00:04:54,460
- Alex, I'm sending an
email to the company asking

122
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,650
who's an Eagles fan.

123
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,650
And they're gonna email you
that they're an Eagle's fan,

124
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,053
put it in a folder, okay?

125
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:04,203
- [Woman] Maggie Huggins
is an Eagle's fan.

126
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:07,080
- That's the best email.

127
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,180
If you're a real Philadelphia Eagle's fan,

128
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,004
and work at VaynerMedia,
please email Alexandria

129
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:12,470
that you are.

130
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,350
Please email Alexandria ASAP.

131
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,546
She's CC'd here, in the body, don't lie.

132
00:05:19,546 --> 00:05:21,629
(laughs)

133
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:23,598
Sent.

134
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:24,490
- [Woman] Sent.

135
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,980
- I love everbody be like
"What about Patriot fans?"

136
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,860
I'm not sending any fucking
Patriot fans to Superbowl.

137
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,210
But four Eagle fans from
VaynerMedia are going.

138
00:05:33,657 --> 00:05:35,980
Andy, are you placing some ads?

139
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,080
Gettin' back to your
roots and doing somethin'?

140
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:47,418
- Get me a copy, an IG copy for the

141
00:05:47,418 --> 00:05:49,280
Crushing It video?

142
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,143
Signing.

143
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,990
- I don't even know what I'm doing,

144
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,925
I'm like "what is this machine?"

145
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:02,758
(laughs)

146
00:06:02,758 --> 00:06:03,820
Known as the computer.

147
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,573
My guy.

148
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,900
How you doin' man?

149
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,090
I've been lookin' forward to this man.

150
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,170
I've been lookin' forward to it.

151
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,003
What's up man.

152
00:06:31,003 --> 00:06:32,010
- Number one in LA --

153
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,360
- I fuck with you heavy as fuck.

154
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,910
I think you guys know,
I'm putting you on blast.

155
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,040
I'm on the record of who I
think is next, and it's you.

156
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,090
Because I have that like, I know my ear,

157
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,980
which is like, I don't think I'm anything,

158
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,050
I don't even like to talk
to music people about music,

159
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,050
but I know me, and I
know like, I just know.

160
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,450
Honestly, on a very serious note man,

161
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,710
I really, really, really
think you've got the

162
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,568
absolute exact right thing
for what's about to happen.

163
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:03,610
I just think you need to,

164
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,790
you know my big thing is
collaborations and volume.

165
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,990
You guys do you, that's always my thing.

166
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,550
To me, I just want you to do more shit,

167
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,450
it's always tricky with
my advice to artists,

168
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,410
'cause I want more volume,

169
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,520
and artists can run like,
they don't wanna dilute it,

170
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,353
they want it to be like per --

171
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:23,330
I have empathy.

172
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,970
But I know it's right,

173
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,450
here's what people don't
understand with volume.

174
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,250
They remember the hits,

175
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,760
they forget the other shit.

176
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,610
You don't have the potential to suck.

177
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,480
You understand that, right?

178
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,370
If I was like --

179
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,360
but, do you understand what I mean?

180
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,870
If I was like, yo, you have
to put out a hundred songs

181
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,030
in a row, your weakest
one of those hundred,

182
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,660
in my opinion, isn't gonna be
weak enough to fuck you up.

183
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,150
And the upside of a
hundred fuckin' at bats,

184
00:07:55,136 --> 00:07:57,580
I believe in that shit.

185
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,370
And then collaborations like,

186
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,620
fuck, I think I was just listening
to one of yours just now,

187
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,550
let me see.

188
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,550
This would be great.

189
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,600
Yup, this is literally
what I'm listening to.

190
00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:12,343
(♪ "Monday to Monday" by SABA)

191
00:08:12,343 --> 00:08:16,720
Like this, as many of those as possible.

192
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,186
I can't say it enough man,

193
00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:22,350
you guys are in it, and
you know it better than me,

194
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,020
I just know what humans do.

195
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,870
That's why I'm gonna do my thing,

196
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,550
it's just at bats.

197
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,230
People don't get it.

198
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,910
It's just tomorrow's song,

199
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,240
that changes everything.

200
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,090
- I think people would wanna know,

201
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,740
all this music is so personal
and it's so motivational,

202
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,700
- That's why I like it.

203
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,809
- That's why you like it.

204
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,642
Everyone likes it.

205
00:08:39,643 --> 00:08:40,476
- I like Russ because

206
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:42,150
he's competitive and chip on the shoulder.

207
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,980
It's all based on versions
of my own personality.

208
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,470
- It's so smooth and then it's like,

209
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,020
you perform that to a live
ass crowd and it's a smash.

210
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,940
- You're talkin' truth.

211
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,050
- He's real.

212
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,040
- And you're not scared to
go into territories that

213
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,909
don't look the part.

214
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,350
That's it.

215
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,840
- I be speakin' like third person,

216
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,173
I got a song called "Money Don't Change"

217
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,086
on CD three,

218
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:10,528
"I hope the money don't change you,"

219
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:13,182
and I ain't talkin' to like,
nobody else but myself.

220
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:15,174
- You know what's funny about that?

221
00:09:15,174 --> 00:09:18,193
One of my favorite things I say ever,

222
00:09:18,193 --> 00:09:19,859
I say a lotta shit,

223
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:24,399
is "money doesn't change
you, it just exposes you."

224
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,482
I'm not a real music guy,

225
00:09:28,391 --> 00:09:31,079
the reason I fuck with
you is what you're saying.

226
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:33,246
I like the story, ya know?

227
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:36,636
I like that you're going
to places that I think

228
00:09:36,636 --> 00:09:38,594
are vulnerable and truth,

229
00:09:38,594 --> 00:09:41,425
'cause that guy and that
girl will always win.

230
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:43,693
That's what people don't
understand about Pac and Biggie,

231
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:47,526
actually go back and
listen to Pac and Biggie.

232
00:09:49,176 --> 00:09:50,752
- Real life stuff.

233
00:09:50,752 --> 00:09:53,880
- You guys are youngsters,
you don't understand,

234
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,840
Brenda's got a baby, that was ridiculous.

235
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,896
That was shit like, like Biggie --

236
00:09:59,896 --> 00:10:01,550
- [Gunna] It made people cry,

237
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,500
it brought tears to people's eyes.

238
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,046
- And just like story telling, right?

239
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:08,735
Biggie's funny, like I got a
story to tell you, it's funny.

240
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:10,060
That was different.

241
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,990
This was when hip hop was like,

242
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,250
I'm hardcore, I'm tough
and you're not, simple.

243
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,590
Binary. There was no other story.

244
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,850
They broke out for a million reasons,

245
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,021
I mean I watch every documentary,

246
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:26,430
I read everything,

247
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,720
and I'm waiting for somebody to say,

248
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,730
those guys broke out.

249
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,280
They say storytellers,

250
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,089
they'll compare them to KRS
One and things, that's fine.

251
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:35,600
It's the vulnerability.

252
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,980
My advice, go in a cocoon.

253
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,260
Meaning go out, but
like mentally, a cocoon.

254
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,400
Anything that veers you from
completely dominating, be out.

255
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,210
You can go out every night,

256
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,780
but don't get caught up in anything,

257
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,490
like you need to be obsessed.

258
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,100
'Cause gifts are fuckin' rare, man.

259
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,930
My guy.

260
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:00,763
- Thanks.

261
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:02,560
- Yeah, man, I'm really rootin' for you.

262
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,649
Good to see you.

263
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:04,482
(laughs)

264
00:11:04,482 --> 00:11:05,315
Real pleasure man.

265
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:06,148
Good to see you, bro.

266
00:11:06,148 --> 00:11:07,379
Don't ever wear that jersey in here again.

267
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:08,383
(laughs)

268
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:11,900
Come on, let's go.

269
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,183
I love it.

270
00:11:14,183 --> 00:11:15,016
Thank you.

271
00:11:17,773 --> 00:11:18,606
See ya.

272
00:11:19,607 --> 00:11:20,440
- [Woman] Are you okay?

273
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,273
- [Gary] Yeah.

274
00:11:21,273 --> 00:11:22,106
- [Woman] You sure?

275
00:11:22,106 --> 00:11:22,939
- [Gary] Yeah.

276
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:23,772
- [Woman] Going? Oh my god. I feel so --

277
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:25,940
- Hey vlog, didn't capture that footage?

278
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,836
Whenever you cut capture, just run it.

279
00:11:27,836 --> 00:11:30,420
Vlog, I just tore my ACL I think.

280
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,130
The elevator just destroyed my knee.

281
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,200
But that's what you have to
do when you fuckin' hustle.

282
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,540
Stick your leg in the elevator

283
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,665
to save that 28 seconds in my count.

284
00:11:38,665 --> 00:00:00,000
(techno music)
