1
00:00:00,296 --> 00:00:01,716
- Okay.

2
00:00:01,716 --> 00:00:02,604
What episode is it?

3
00:00:02,604 --> 00:00:04,447
(hip hop music)

4
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:05,570
♫ Me and Gary V up in the office

5
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,788
♫ Do rap zapping wanting do corporate

6
00:00:07,788 --> 00:00:10,272
♫ Talks about all the shipping leverage

7
00:00:10,272 --> 00:00:14,439
♫ 1,800 checks, check out the average.

8
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:17,401
Life's about alternatives like,

9
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:19,096
like everybody who watches this like

10
00:00:19,096 --> 00:00:21,382
when they leave comments,
like when you leave

11
00:00:21,382 --> 00:00:23,130
fuckin' comments like, blah, blah, blah,

12
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,570
okay cool, what's the alternative?

13
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,934
Don't tell me blah, blah, blah,

14
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:27,695
tell me what the fuck
else is the other option.

15
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,690
Like don't be optimistic, be pessimistic.

16
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,842
You know, don't think it's true, great,

17
00:00:32,842 --> 00:00:34,601
be cynical, don't wanna work hard,

18
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,562
great, don't work hard.

19
00:00:36,562 --> 00:00:39,102
Like don't tell me I'm wrong,

20
00:00:39,102 --> 00:00:43,375
don't judge, like what's the alternatives?

21
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,631
Like for me what's fun is I'm documenting,

22
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:47,048
I'm not creating.

23
00:00:48,146 --> 00:00:49,864
Like I don't do Daily Vee.

24
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:51,734
My job is not Gary V.

25
00:00:51,734 --> 00:00:53,026
I fuckin' work.

26
00:00:53,026 --> 00:00:56,465
Like I'm moving, I'm doing,
I'm letting my actions speak.

27
00:00:56,465 --> 00:00:59,132
(hip hop music)

28
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,448
- How would you tell somebody to find

29
00:01:07,448 --> 00:01:08,865
their main focus?

30
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:11,106
'Cause sometimes it seems
like there's so much.

31
00:01:11,106 --> 00:01:13,873
- There's nothing, think
about this question.

32
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:14,873
I tell them.

33
00:01:16,282 --> 00:01:17,985
Right, it's like how do you
tell somebody to be in shape

34
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:19,251
like this dude?

35
00:01:19,251 --> 00:01:20,964
You put in the work, right?

36
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:22,512
Like, hey, do sit ups, eat well,

37
00:01:22,512 --> 00:01:24,486
like it's so crazy.

38
00:01:24,486 --> 00:01:26,486
Everything's very basic.

39
00:01:28,674 --> 00:01:30,387
It just comes down to
do you do it, or not.

40
00:01:30,387 --> 00:01:32,609
I think the reason my content resonates is

41
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:34,359
I never waver, right?

42
00:01:36,105 --> 00:01:38,300
Like I think a lot of you know,

43
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,240
after a little while,

44
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,966
you get the gist of what I'm about.

45
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:44,250
And then only the reason I think

46
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,826
I'm worth listening to after
you figured that part out,

47
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:48,827
is I'm good at trend spotting,

48
00:01:48,827 --> 00:01:50,746
and if you listen to me and watch me,

49
00:01:50,746 --> 00:01:52,323
you can pick up things you can do

50
00:01:52,323 --> 00:01:53,764
that will make your life better.

51
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:56,257
But it only takes you
about, if you're smart,

52
00:01:56,257 --> 00:01:57,921
it takes you about 30 days to realize,

53
00:01:57,921 --> 00:01:59,689
I'm gonna say the same, I'm literally

54
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:02,685
gonna say the same shit
for the next 50 years.

55
00:02:02,685 --> 00:02:05,079
I mean, the motivational thing is real,

56
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,391
but I think you can get
that at other places.

57
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:10,189
There's plenty of Instagram
accounts that say, "Go do it".

58
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:13,115
I think the fact that
I'm actually doing it,

59
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:14,948
and I don't want anything from you

60
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:16,885
is a powerful relationship point,

61
00:02:16,885 --> 00:02:18,777
but then I think the longevity comes

62
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:21,217
in that I'm gonna do this around AR,

63
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:23,529
NVR, and 10 other things that I don't

64
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:25,280
even know are coming.

65
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,002
And I think, I didn't, Alexa's skills

66
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:30,629
and podcasts were around a year ago.

67
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:31,982
They were around.

68
00:02:31,982 --> 00:02:34,102
I wasn't interested 'cause I didn't feel

69
00:02:34,102 --> 00:02:35,998
the movement in the market.

70
00:02:35,998 --> 00:02:37,492
Now I do.

71
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:40,507
And I think if I leave you with anything,

72
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:42,134
like whatever you wanna do in your life,

73
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:44,256
it's super important to
watch what I'm doing.

74
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:46,227
I have like a really long track record

75
00:02:46,227 --> 00:02:48,827
of being successful on
land-grabbing early,

76
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:51,638
and getting disproportionate value of it.

77
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,753
And so you can apply that to yourselves.

78
00:02:53,753 --> 00:02:55,798
(pop music)

79
00:02:55,798 --> 00:02:57,804
♫ Acting on your best behavior

80
00:02:57,804 --> 00:03:01,971
♫ Turn your back on mother nature

81
00:03:02,941 --> 00:03:06,774
♫ Everybody wants to rule the

82
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:12,588
Which is why I don't like

83
00:03:12,588 --> 00:03:17,010
the current state of
entrepreneurship in the world.

84
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,569
Because it seems very
party and popular and cool,

85
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:24,945
and it is literally everything but.

86
00:03:24,945 --> 00:03:26,896
I started my daily vlog,

87
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:29,007
yes, I like attention and I want selfies,

88
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:31,203
but much more because I want people

89
00:03:31,203 --> 00:03:33,569
to see how hard it really is.

90
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:35,766
How long every day is.

91
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:37,803
If you really wanna be successful.

92
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:38,636
And so,

93
00:03:40,085 --> 00:03:42,289
I'm scared of everything,

94
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:45,521
which actually ironically
means I'm scared of nothing.

95
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:47,354
- Right, that is--

96
00:03:47,354 --> 00:03:48,333
- Do you understand?

97
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,353
- Yeah, I get it.

98
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:50,507
- It's like, got it?

99
00:03:50,507 --> 00:03:51,371
I know it's a funny little statement,

100
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:54,247
but by accepting fear of everything,

101
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:55,721
it kind of makes me numb

102
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,752
and makes me not fear anything.

103
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:00,102
- Anything, yeah.

104
00:04:00,102 --> 00:04:01,770
That's awesome, more questions, guys.

105
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,749
(audience applauds)

106
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:04,043
See you off stage.

107
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,113
- [Gary] Thank you.

108
00:04:05,113 --> 00:04:06,158
- [Interviewer] Thank you.

109
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:06,991
- [Cameraman] Go here Gary.

110
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:09,324
(pop music)

111
00:04:18,557 --> 00:04:21,308
- Here are the things
I've learned at Rise 2017.

112
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:22,770
Gary V likes air quoting,

113
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,292
and the word, "Arbitrage".

114
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:26,875
(group laughs)

115
00:04:39,816 --> 00:04:41,736
(audience applauds)

116
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:43,280
- [Host] Before I introduce Gary V.

117
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,530
(mumbles).

118
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:52,201
He needs no introduction,

119
00:04:52,201 --> 00:04:56,228
please welcome the social
juggernaut himself,

120
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:57,297
Mr Gary Vaynerchuck.

121
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,496
(audience cheers)

122
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:01,606
- First of all, thank you
guys so much for coming.

123
00:05:01,606 --> 00:05:03,606
It's awesome to be here.

124
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,923
I think everybody here

125
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:15,931
if I told them "everything
is gonna be okay,

126
00:05:15,931 --> 00:05:17,828
"You can have everything you want,

127
00:05:17,828 --> 00:05:20,130
"now, what are you
gonna do with your day?"

128
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,873
I think a lot of people know.

129
00:05:22,873 --> 00:05:24,346
It could be anything.

130
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:27,763
If you were to then watch movies all day,

131
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,717
like if we played this game,

132
00:05:29,717 --> 00:05:31,661
and you're like, okay, everything?

133
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:34,135
Well fuck, I don't wanna do
shit, I just wanna watch movies.

134
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:37,260
Cool, I think you should
build a business around that.

135
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,132
(interviewer laughs)

136
00:05:38,132 --> 00:05:39,558
Right, like to me, great.

137
00:05:39,558 --> 00:05:41,975
So I think people are scared.

138
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:46,023
I think people are scared.

139
00:05:46,023 --> 00:05:48,160
I think people are scared
what people will think,

140
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,542
and I think they're scared
that they can't survive

141
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:51,931
living the life that they wanna live

142
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:54,637
from a materialistic standpoint.

143
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:56,931
What makes me so dangerous

144
00:05:56,931 --> 00:05:59,287
is that I don't need anything.

145
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:01,397
I don't need anything,
I don't need anybody,

146
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:04,180
and that's it, and so I'm good.

147
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,111
And I wish that on everybody.

148
00:06:07,111 --> 00:06:08,295
You know how nice it is to not

149
00:06:08,295 --> 00:06:11,116
rely on anybody for anything at all, ever?

150
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:12,664
Not emotionally, not financially,

151
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,414
it's just a zen zone.

152
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:19,647
But purpose is to make yourself happy.

153
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,174
No regrets.

154
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:23,928
You're welcome, good bye

155
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:24,919
- Hi, Gary!

156
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:25,935
- Hey, good to see you, yes, we're coming.

157
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:27,318
- Hey Gary.

158
00:06:27,318 --> 00:06:29,162
- Thanks again, Patrick.

159
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:30,342
This guy is here.

160
00:06:30,342 --> 00:06:31,438
Pleasure.

161
00:06:31,438 --> 00:06:32,271
- [Man] Let's go.

162
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:35,572
- You know what, I got the
budget to hire someone,

163
00:06:35,572 --> 00:06:39,016
and I'm struggling if I
hire someone for ecommerce,

164
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:42,099
or someone like a guy, a guy with me.

165
00:06:43,942 --> 00:06:46,417
- I would hire somebody
for sales or ecommerce.

166
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:48,692
Because that will get bigger return,

167
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:50,585
that will get more return quickly,

168
00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:52,812
which will then allow you
to afford the next thing.

169
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,940
If you go with D-Rock and go branding,

170
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,912
you're gonna have to wait.

171
00:06:55,912 --> 00:06:56,745
- Correct.

172
00:06:56,745 --> 00:06:57,578
- Got it?

173
00:06:57,578 --> 00:06:59,654
- And you know I'm for sales actually,

174
00:06:59,654 --> 00:07:01,006
I'm good for product design.

175
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:02,348
Is that true I need to focus on something

176
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:04,279
I'm bad at, and try to improve?

177
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,458
- [Gary] No, nope.

178
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,898
- Because I hate Photoshop,
I hate this stuff.

179
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:08,047
- [Gary] No.

180
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:09,031
- Okay cool.

181
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:09,864
- Hire somebody for that.

182
00:07:09,864 --> 00:07:10,697
- Right, all right man.

183
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:11,530
Welcome to Hong Kong.

184
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,336
- [Gary] Thank you, my friend.

185
00:07:14,336 --> 00:07:16,064
- Gary, I will see you in like one hour.

186
00:07:16,064 --> 00:07:17,188
- [Gary] See you soon.

187
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:18,177
- Thank you for everything.

188
00:07:18,177 --> 00:07:20,888
- [Gary] Bye thank you, bye.

189
00:07:20,888 --> 00:07:21,721
- See you guys.

190
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:23,721
- Bye everyone, bye bye.

191
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:29,897
(pop music)

192
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:38,998
The obstacle right now that I'm pissed

193
00:07:38,998 --> 00:07:41,716
that nobody takes me up
on my open door policy.

194
00:07:41,716 --> 00:07:43,414
So I'm gonna react to it,

195
00:07:43,414 --> 00:07:44,623
and I'm gonna force every employee

196
00:07:44,623 --> 00:07:46,721
to see me every six months,
period, end of story.

197
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:47,777
I will see them all.

198
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:48,610
- [Interviewer] Every employee?

199
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,443
- That's right.

200
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:50,276
- [Interviewer] That's New York, London?

201
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:51,109
- Whatever it takes.

202
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:52,195
I will give up all the time,
I'm gonna give up five minutes,

203
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:56,261
five minutes, times 800, lots of minutes.

204
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:57,470
- [Interviewer] Why do you think it is?

205
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,619
You think, you mentioned people are--

206
00:07:58,619 --> 00:08:00,494
- I think they have empathy for me,

207
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:01,624
and they think I have better things to do

208
00:08:01,624 --> 00:08:03,408
than hear their five minutes of headaches.

209
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:04,664
I don't think they realize that

210
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:07,276
I wanna fix every problem.

211
00:08:07,276 --> 00:08:08,537
I think they think I'm like every other

212
00:08:08,537 --> 00:08:10,289
one of their managers in the building

213
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,755
that can't fix every problem,

214
00:08:11,755 --> 00:08:13,231
so they don't wanna hear it.

215
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:14,834
I can fix them all.

216
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:16,579
And then other, and then I think cynicism

217
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,439
and fear and lack of self-esteem,

218
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,541
and they think I care
more about being Gary V

219
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,366
than Gary Vaynerchuck to see you,

220
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:23,593
there's a million reasons.

221
00:08:23,593 --> 00:08:24,926
I don't care what the reasons are.

222
00:08:24,926 --> 00:08:26,677
I need to fix my concept.

223
00:08:26,677 --> 00:08:29,738
That's the adversity,
that will make me better,

224
00:08:29,738 --> 00:08:31,305
and that happens every single day.

225
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:32,725
Awesome.

226
00:08:32,725 --> 00:08:34,121
Thank you, good luck to you.

227
00:08:34,121 --> 00:08:35,721
- [Interviewer] Thank you
so much, I appreciate it.

228
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:36,845
- We're gonna go that way, okay?

229
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:37,678
- When, now?

230
00:08:37,678 --> 00:08:38,510
- That way?

231
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,343
- [Cameraman] Yeah.

232
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:40,177
- Okay, go.

233
00:08:40,177 --> 00:08:41,010
- Awesome, nice meeting you.

234
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,789
- Can I have a picture
as well, oops, sorry.

235
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,149
- I can really relate to
what you say, it's amazing.

236
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:48,482
(pop music)

237
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:27,687
- It's true.

238
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:30,116
Okay.

239
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:31,335
What episode is it?

240
00:09:31,335 --> 00:09:33,542
Do you wanna pick up the camera now

241
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:35,070
and show two of our three or four homies

242
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,973
that help us, say hello guys.

243
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:37,994
- Hello, how are you, everyone?

244
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:38,901
- Hello.

245
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:39,734
- Vaynur-Nation, what's up?

246
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:40,840
(laughs)

247
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,007
- These are our two amazing teammates.

248
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:46,089
You keep asking questions,

249
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:48,162
I'll keep answering them.

250
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:48,995
Cool.

251
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,524
- [Cameraman] Do you wanna do a

252
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,376
thanks for watching, subscribe?

253
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:54,644
- No, not really.

254
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:56,807
Sorry, thank you for asking.

255
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:58,881
Daniello, I'm very upset

256
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:00,557
because you're not with us,

257
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:02,414
and I fully expected you to be here.

258
00:10:02,414 --> 00:10:04,222
First of all I hear you're
a badass entrepreneur,

259
00:10:04,222 --> 00:10:05,706
so I can't wait to meet you.

260
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,669
Look how smiley your partner is.

261
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:08,962
(laughs)

262
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:10,808
Can't wait to meet, keep grinding,

263
00:10:10,808 --> 00:10:12,466
keep hustling, but most importantly,

264
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:15,660
recognize how hardcore
of a winner you are,

265
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,519
and deploy that confidence from a day

266
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,280
in and day out standpoint.

267
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,113
See ya.

268
00:10:23,218 --> 00:10:25,147
(pop music)

269
00:10:25,147 --> 00:10:27,785
♫ I can see you hiding all the scars

270
00:10:27,785 --> 00:10:31,187
♫ Wearing a facade

271
00:10:31,187 --> 00:10:34,520
♫ Not meaning to offend

272
00:10:35,653 --> 00:10:38,936
♫ But girl you can't pretend

273
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:41,395
♫ No, no

274
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:44,216
♫ I never see you

275
00:10:44,216 --> 00:10:48,900
♫ Trying to reach out
connecting with your heart

276
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,233
♫ Not meaning to lament

277
00:10:53,364 --> 00:10:56,776
♫ But girl you can't pretend

278
00:10:56,776 --> 00:10:59,355
♫ No, no

279
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:01,081
♫ I ain't gonna tell you lies

280
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:03,598
♫ Feed you porkie pies

281
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:07,245
♫ I can tell you once I can tell you twice

282
00:11:07,245 --> 00:11:10,078
♫ You never learn

283
00:11:11,143 --> 00:11:13,612
♫ When will you ever learn

284
00:11:13,612 --> 00:11:14,629
Thank you so much.

285
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:15,462
(laughs)

286
00:11:15,462 --> 00:11:16,295
Thank you.

287
00:11:16,295 --> 00:11:17,128
- You're awesome, I loved it.

288
00:11:17,128 --> 00:11:17,961
- Thank you brother.

289
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:18,794
- Your line is fucking amazing.

290
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:20,057
- Thank you, brother, thank you.

291
00:11:20,057 --> 00:11:21,138
- No, it's really good.

292
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,300
- Thank you.

293
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,024
- Inviting others, I know
you stopped them for a while.

294
00:11:24,024 --> 00:11:26,092
- Then I started investing,

295
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:27,985
and then what happened was I invested

296
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:29,404
in Twitter and Facebook and a lot of

297
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:31,044
crazy things started happening,

298
00:11:31,044 --> 00:11:34,282
and now I run a very
large social media agency,

299
00:11:34,282 --> 00:11:35,367
800 people.

300
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:38,394
But the family still owns the business.

301
00:11:38,394 --> 00:11:40,462
- Okay, why you don't do any more videos?

302
00:11:40,462 --> 00:11:41,448
- I haven't done videos.

303
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:42,960
You know, five years every day.

304
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,050
- (laughs) It's a lot.

305
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,128
- It was a run.

306
00:11:47,128 --> 00:11:48,473
- Awesome, nice to meet you buddy.

307
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:49,484
- Thank you.

308
00:11:49,484 --> 00:11:51,676
Thank you for recognizing
me and thanks for watching.

309
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:53,787
- That's awesome, it's a great show.

310
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:54,620
- Thank you.

311
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,453
- This one over here.

312
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:56,286
- Thank you.

313
00:11:56,286 --> 00:11:57,119
Hello.

314
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:57,952
- [Table] Hello!

315
00:11:57,952 --> 00:11:58,785
- [Gordon] I'm Gordon.

316
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,178
- [Gary] Gordon, how are you, Gary.

317
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,171
- [Gordon] Nice to meet you.

318
00:12:01,171 --> 00:12:02,295
- Hey, nice to meet you, Jason.

319
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:03,292
- Jason, such a pleasure.

320
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,312
- [Lady In Black] Gary, it's not your

321
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:05,145
first time in Hong Kong?

322
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:05,978
- It's my first time.

323
00:12:05,978 --> 00:12:08,569
No, it's even better, it's
my first time in Asia.

324
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:09,720
- [Table] Oh!

325
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
- Oh, is it?

326
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,168
- [Blonde Lady] And not the last one, no?

327
00:12:12,168 --> 00:12:13,146
- No, not at all.

328
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:16,402
Yeah, you know, a mix of serendipity

329
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,754
and just focusing on the proper timing

330
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:22,320
and making every second count,

331
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,840
I've been really looking forward to it,

332
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,011
and it's been, it's been so pent up

333
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:30,731
that when we landed, in baggage claim,

334
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:32,452
we weren't even out of baggage claim

335
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,485
and I looked at D Rock, this is,

336
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:36,030
I'm gonna like this place.

337
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,446
(group laughs)

338
00:12:37,446 --> 00:12:40,253
It's been such a remarkable
two and a half days,

339
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:42,305
like I can't wait to come back.

340
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:44,831
The level of gratitude
for entrepreneurship

341
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,648
and what it's done for me and my family,

342
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:49,231
the energy in this marketplace,

343
00:12:51,185 --> 00:12:53,039
and in this region in general

344
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,344
I think I associate more
a little bit even more

345
00:12:56,344 --> 00:12:59,604
than I would say than I
would associate with the US,

346
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:02,237
and definitely Europe's version of it.

347
00:13:02,237 --> 00:13:03,487
So, that, yeah.

348
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,484
I mean, I grew up in the wine business,

349
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:08,876
I've spent a lot of time in Europe.

350
00:13:08,876 --> 00:13:12,293
The rawness to the entrepreneurial spirit

351
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,845
is intoxicating for me.

352
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,593
And so,

353
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:22,254
I would say that's probably a thing

354
00:13:22,254 --> 00:13:24,831
that stood out the most.

355
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:26,282
And I'll tell you another thing,

356
00:13:26,282 --> 00:13:29,032
and, I am quite passionate around

357
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:34,311
having really important conversations

358
00:13:34,311 --> 00:13:38,419
with young entrepreneurs
around family dynamics.

359
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:41,237
And I think one of the things I'm

360
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,395
most excited about, obviously so much

361
00:13:43,395 --> 00:13:45,044
of my strategy in coming to Asia

362
00:13:45,044 --> 00:13:47,265
is leading with my content first.

363
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:48,514
I think I'm gonna be able to help

364
00:13:48,514 --> 00:13:50,927
a lot of kids have difficult conversations

365
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:53,205
with their parents that in a 50 year macro

366
00:13:53,205 --> 00:13:55,826
will be enormously beneficial,

367
00:13:55,826 --> 00:13:58,047
but because there's a lot of pressure

368
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:02,098
in the Asian ecosystem around education

369
00:14:02,098 --> 00:14:03,675
or doing the right thing,

370
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:06,568
and I'm very empathetic to that.

371
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:08,818
My great moment of my life,

372
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:12,171
I would actually argue is

373
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:14,329
the fact that even
though I was an immigrant

374
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:16,365
in the US my mom had enough self-esteem

375
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:19,198
to support me being a bad student,

376
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:24,449
which became the foundation of my success.

377
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:25,992
- [Blonde Lady] Unconditional love.

378
00:14:25,992 --> 00:14:27,019
- Unconditional love,

379
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:30,150
and really predicated on
enormous self-confidence

380
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,334
in my mom that she knew what
she was doing parenting,

381
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:36,077
and didn't need to follow the blueprint.

382
00:14:36,077 --> 00:14:38,448
'Cause a lot of this has
to do with insecurities

383
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:39,698
of the parents.

384
00:14:41,858 --> 00:14:46,348
So yeah, some interesting
things I picked up on already.

385
00:14:46,348 --> 00:14:49,448
- When you say the rawness,
what do you mean by that?

386
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:52,095
- I think a little bit of a level of

387
00:14:52,095 --> 00:14:54,095
a chip on your shoulder,

388
00:14:58,335 --> 00:15:01,774
great wild wild west
slam grab opportunity,

389
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:04,524
maybe even an inch or two of like

390
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,483
doing it at all costs.

391
00:15:09,557 --> 00:15:13,224
A little less polish,
a little less process.

392
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:15,939
Results-oriented.

393
00:15:17,218 --> 00:15:19,435
One of the things that was fearful

394
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:22,826
is an admiration of
Silicon Valley culture,

395
00:15:22,826 --> 00:15:26,511
which I think over time is
a negative for the region.

396
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:28,654
Because then you start building financial

397
00:15:28,654 --> 00:15:31,738
arbitrage machines, not actual businesses.

398
00:15:31,738 --> 00:15:34,821
So yeah, just a little bit more of a,

399
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:37,783
like just generally a little bit more

400
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:39,450
of a go-to attitude.

401
00:15:42,587 --> 00:15:46,479
Yeah, like the questions, the tonality,

402
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,094
even the way I'm being pitched.

403
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:49,732
And you know what's interesting?

404
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:52,152
What I'm trying to figure out is

405
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,735
is there a chip on the shoulder

406
00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:58,730
to a US Silicon Valley-centric thing,

407
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,854
which I think there should be

408
00:16:00,854 --> 00:16:03,794
in a place where, especially when you look

409
00:16:03,794 --> 00:16:06,397
at mainland China, you
know, those companies,

410
00:16:06,397 --> 00:16:09,902
they're so much further
ahead in a lot of ways

411
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:13,071
because of their full integration.

412
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:14,581
I don't know, there's just,

413
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:16,762
there's a clearly different tone,

414
00:16:16,762 --> 00:16:19,717
which my early intuition leads to

415
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:22,884
good, with my other intuition which is

416
00:16:24,756 --> 00:16:27,783
there's too much looking at other places,

417
00:16:27,783 --> 00:16:30,152
and it should get, I think Asia should

418
00:16:30,152 --> 00:16:32,720
get more insular, 'cause
I think the natural

419
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,759
behaviors are better.

420
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,820
- Right, right.

421
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,790
(pop music)

422
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,529
♫ Think back through your life

423
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:41,695
♫ Think of all those guys

424
00:16:41,695 --> 00:16:45,410
♫ Ready did they try to commit their time

425
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,334
♫ 'Cause you never learn

426
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:52,614
♫ Girl I wish you learned

427
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:55,031
♫ But no, no

428
00:16:56,828 --> 00:17:00,328
♫ Girl I wish you learned

429
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:17,828
♫ Girl I wish you learned

430
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,195
- It used to be, still is actually,

431
00:17:33,195 --> 00:17:35,511
a very influential wine bottle.

432
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:36,344
- Wow.

433
00:17:36,344 --> 00:17:37,274
- [Lady] Oh wow.

434
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:39,791
- It's a small technical mouthful,

435
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:44,084
because most people love the (mumbles).

436
00:17:44,084 --> 00:17:44,917
- Thank you.

437
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:46,183
- [Man] This is so good.

438
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:47,185
- Thank you.

439
00:17:47,185 --> 00:17:49,323
(table applauds)

440
00:17:49,323 --> 00:17:51,656
(pop music)

441
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:08,562
♫ I know it's hard to

442
00:18:08,562 --> 00:18:10,356
♫ Face up to the facts

443
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:13,916
♫ But you must react

444
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:18,239
♫ Just 'cause you've learned to wait

445
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,478
♫ That doesn't mean you changed

446
00:18:21,478 --> 00:00:00,000
♫ No, no.
