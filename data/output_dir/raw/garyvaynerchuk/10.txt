1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,010
- Andy's part of this call?

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,030
- I don't have to be.

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,090
- [Iris] You're leaving and
then this is like the end.

4
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,050
- Okay cool.

5
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:07,883
Really?

6
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,301
Okay vlog, weird episode.

7
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:12,362
I don't even know if we have
a fucking blog, vlog today.

8
00:00:12,362 --> 00:00:14,945
(hip-hop beat)

9
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:19,982
- Hey.

10
00:00:19,982 --> 00:00:20,815
- How are you?

11
00:00:20,815 --> 00:00:21,648
- Feels good.

12
00:00:21,648 --> 00:00:22,481
- Nice to meet you.

13
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:23,372
- Nice to see you.

14
00:00:23,372 --> 00:00:24,602
- Here you go, put this on.

15
00:00:24,602 --> 00:00:25,435
- What's cooking?

16
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:27,237
- So well I'm a resident here.

17
00:00:27,237 --> 00:00:29,474
It really feels good to be here.

18
00:00:29,474 --> 00:00:30,307
- How long you been here?

19
00:00:30,307 --> 00:00:31,660
- Three months.

20
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,493
- What team are you on?

21
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:34,470
- So I'm on the influencer team.

22
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,810
Under Kristina and Esmeralda.

23
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,259
Yeah, so I just wanted to basically--

24
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:41,210
- Stuff and all that?

25
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,043
- Yup.

26
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:43,470
- How's it going?

27
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,303
- It's going well.

28
00:00:44,303 --> 00:00:45,136
- Where you from?

29
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:47,320
- Funny story I'm from
Middletown, New York upstate.

30
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,208
It's an like an hour away.

31
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,041
- Yup.

32
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,660
- Yeah so I come here
everyday, wake up at five,

33
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,530
get up, get on a bus, get here at 8:30,

34
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,330
stay here til about 6:00.

35
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,410
- Wanting to be here.

36
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,793
- Yes, 100%.

37
00:00:58,793 --> 00:00:59,710
- How come?

38
00:01:01,236 --> 00:01:02,198
- It's VaynerMedia man.

39
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:03,031
(laughing)

40
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:04,652
This is where it's at.

41
00:01:04,652 --> 00:01:07,510
I love the hustle, I love the drive,

42
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,880
this is the future, you know?

43
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,549
Digital content is everything to me.

44
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:12,382
- Yup.

45
00:01:12,382 --> 00:01:15,260
- I wanna be able to be where--

46
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,250
- The game's gonna be.

47
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,110
- Yes, exactly.

48
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,680
So I wanna be in, eventually
I wanna be able to be like

49
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,810
a creative director or
be like the next you know

50
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,400
Spielberg or something like that.

51
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,496
- Good for you.

52
00:01:25,496 --> 00:01:26,329
You're a creator.

53
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:27,162
- Yes, I create content.

54
00:01:27,162 --> 00:01:27,995
- Video?

55
00:01:27,995 --> 00:01:28,828
- Yup.

56
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:29,661
Content, video.

57
00:01:29,661 --> 00:01:32,180
I started doing photography,
funny story, recently

58
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,170
because it's a lot easier
to be able to push content

59
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,160
that is photography.

60
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,490
I'm really busy and trying to hustle,

61
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,550
it's hard for me to mitigate.

62
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,383
- Makes sense, makes sense.

63
00:01:40,383 --> 00:01:42,100
- And I don't wanna put
out low quality stuff

64
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,414
on my Instagram--

65
00:01:43,414 --> 00:01:44,402
- But you know how I think about that?

66
00:01:44,402 --> 00:01:45,235
You gotta be thoughtful.

67
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:46,068
- Just put everything and document it.

68
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:47,290
- Just be smart.

69
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,840
Don't overthink it too much.

70
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,150
'Cause that'll hurt you.

71
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,020
If you start thinking
everything's gotta be Spielberg,

72
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,988
you're gonna lose 'cause
that's the next game.

73
00:01:54,988 --> 00:01:56,740
- Right, that's true.

74
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,930
- You're using an old game as a barometer

75
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,380
while you know you wanna
be part of the new game.

76
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:04,478
- Very true.

77
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:05,311
- Understand?

78
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:06,970
- Yeah.

79
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,190
- Keep that in mind.

80
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,780
'Cause that is absolutely
creators' death blow.

81
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,891
You know my content.

82
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:13,724
- Oh yeah.

83
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:14,870
- It's what I tell hip-hop kids.

84
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,470
They wanna put out one
song a fuckin' year,

85
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,860
it's not gonna work.

86
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,730
It's what I tell creators like,

87
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,680
the lighting and the sound
doesn't have to be perfect.

88
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,513
- That's true.

89
00:02:23,513 --> 00:02:24,346
- It doesn't.

90
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:27,580
It did when you have to make
a $500 million dollar movie.

91
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,160
But not a fuckin' Instagram post.

92
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,180
Not one vlog.

93
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,573
- That's true.

94
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:35,647
- Real pleasure man, I wish you well.

95
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:36,480
- Thank you.

96
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,313
- Have a great day.

97
00:02:37,313 --> 00:02:38,146
- You too.

98
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:38,979
- Okay, let me bounce.

99
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:39,920
Love you, see you, bye.

100
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,240
- Did you wanna go downstairs?

101
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,760
- Yeah I got a call like
what, eight minutes ago?

102
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,690
- Three.

103
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,523
- Cool.

104
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,857
Andy's part of this call?

105
00:02:52,857 --> 00:02:53,970
- I don't have to be.

106
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,388
- [Iris] You're leaving and
then this is like the end.

107
00:02:56,388 --> 00:02:57,221
- Okay, cool.

108
00:02:57,221 --> 00:02:58,054
Really?

109
00:02:58,054 --> 00:02:58,890
Okay vlog, weird episode.

110
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,270
I don't even know, I don't even know if

111
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,020
we have a fuckin' blog, vlog today.

112
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,390
I don't know what to call it.

113
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,223
(laughing)

114
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:06,310
It's such a shit vlog
that I called it a blog.

115
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,000
Here's what I give a fuck about.

116
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,030
This'll be a nice little short video

117
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,720
that's about to probably
turn into a three minute rant

118
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,010
so stick with me here.

119
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,550
I'm getting weirdly in
tuned to my kindness

120
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,530
and being a good person and caring,

121
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,440
you've seen it on Instagram,

122
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,230
I talked about it in view yesterday.

123
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,360
I'm starting to try to
understand where the new alpha

124
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,840
business leader is gonna
have to really, really settle

125
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,010
into like how nice of a
person are they because

126
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,510
I think it's becoming, and
it's always been weirdly,

127
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,350
but becoming even more
essential to success

128
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,480
which excites the fuck out of me.

129
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,460
Number two, I'm obsessed
with Instagram Stories.

130
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,660
Number three, and the
ads within them, so--

131
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,944
- Search @garyvee on
gifs on Instagram Stories

132
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:45,777

133
00:03:45,777 --> 00:03:48,480

- A lot.

137
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,260

138
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,380

two days has 300,000 views.

139
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,181
- Okay, big right hook, actually let's let

140
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:01,980
the whole right hook fuck it up.

141
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,813
What do I care about?

142
00:04:02,813 --> 00:04:03,646
I got 4Ds in London.

143
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:06,861
Motherfuckers 4Ds in London

00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,130
We got a sneaker coming,
that's gonna go hard.

147
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,970
We're gonna fuckin' try

148
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,329

149
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,649

- London, Toronto, how
cool how you're doing--

151
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,170
- Oh yeah, I'm doing pop ups
for the Crushing It sneaker.

152
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,831
We only made 600 pairs of these.

153
00:04:27,831 --> 00:04:30,570
They're gonna be fuckin'
$1000 on eBay and StockX,

154
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,668
mark my words.

155
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:34,970
London, Toronto, London.

156
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,610
So those are gonna be three pop ups.

157
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,810

Yes, so that's going on.

A lot of people used it.

This is how I'm gonna give
away stuff all day long.

165
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,283
You're gonna be seeing me
in Wine Country next week.

166
00:04:56,283 --> 00:04:57,894
There's that.

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,660
- Okay, Saturday 24th there

171
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,020
so order it on Amazon.

172
00:05:13,844 --> 00:05:15,390
So let's buy more.

00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,320
Okay, we're at 300?

00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,120
What do you think it should be, 700?

175
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,080
A lot of people already bought the book.

176
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,530
Wine Library's sitting

177

500, okay so we'll do that.

179
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,360
Make that happen.

180
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,270
What else is happening?

181
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:37,545
- VaynerSports.

182
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,180
- Yeah, I mean small
businesses that wanna do stuff

183
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,013
with VaynerSports.

184
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:42,920
We're gonna put up all these URLs like,

185
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,010
Andy you'll help Iris, like
all these different URLs?

186
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,460
'Cause at the forum for VaynerSports,

187
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,160
people that wanna jam.

188
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,260
4Ds man, that's really changing the game.

189
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,146
Businesses are spending $10,000 dollars.

190
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:55,597
- I think it's crazy that we talked to

191
00:05:55,597 --> 00:05:57,770
in the old company, it's insane.

192
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,790
He doesn't have a Facebook
page on his website

193
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,350
but he is doing everything else.

194
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,530
- If you're doing over a
million dollars a year,

195
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,560
you should come to New York

196
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,240
and or London on March 8th and do a 4Ds.

197
00:06:10,185 --> 00:06:12,080
I'm gonna talk a lot more about selling

198
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,490
and selling is about selling
something you believe in.

199
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,840
I've been very quiet about
VaynerMedia's 4Ds program

200
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,990
'cause it's $10,000
dollars, it's not cheap

201
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,800
for a consulting session day
for me 'cause I come from zero,

202
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,970
but fuckin' watching all
these people make money.

203
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,180
Like the people that went to 4Ds

204
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,900
in fuckin' October,
November, every fuckin' place

205
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,030
I go now like, in Tampa
you saw the guys like,

206
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,760
they're fuckin' making money.

207
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,760
So I don't know, fuck it.

208
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,686
So 4Ds motherfuckers.

209
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,900
And if you are on YouTube
or Facebook watching this,

210
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,210
if you're not following me on Instagram,

211
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,950
that is the fundamental craziest
decision of your career.

212
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,816
It's a massive mistake, it is the funnel.

213
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:47,400
And by the way, Twitter
is exploding pretty too.

214
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,860
Twitter's getting important.

215
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,520
Like I'm weirdly way
more into Twitter lately.

216
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,012
I'm engaging my, I've
always been smart on Twitter

217
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:56,100
but like I feel like I'm really in it.

218
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,940
I feel like a lot of
people, you know what it is?

219
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,540
Actually, can we throw some right hook?

220
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,040
- You've always been in
it but it's more content,

221
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,873
I would say.

222
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:05,410
- Seth, where's your audio content?

223
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,990
Like I want these audio videos
that you and fuckin' Calvin

224
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,380
and Caesar and all you fuckin'
characters promised me.

225
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,760
Fuck Caesar, like let's go,

226
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,460
let's make 'em everyday, let's go.

227
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,310
So I'm excited about that,
very excited about the podcast.

228
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,340
If you're not following my podcast,

229
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,190
it's like you're not
subscribed to my podcast,

230
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,500
that is a fundamental
crazy thing in your life.

231
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
First In Line, First In
Line's gonna be the big one.

232
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,920
Like if you don't know
what First In Line is,

233
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,140
it's my messenger, just
message me on Facebook

234
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,140
and it automatically replies.

235
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,050
If you just message me
on Facebook right now,

236
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,560
it automatically replies.

237
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,098
Anyway, lots going on.

238
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:43,720
Just call this the fuckin'
biz dev episode, perfect.

239
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,640
What else do we fuckin' want people to do?

240
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,000
Buy the book, if don't you have the book,

241
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,390
it's fundamentally the craziest thing

242
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,690
you're doing in your life.

243
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:52,660
- Would you do first IG?

244
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,890
- What about, what about, Seth,

245
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,320
are we being serious
about, I don't feel like

246
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,830
we're being serious enough
about my Alexa skill.

247
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,368
Are we?

248
00:08:00,368 --> 00:08:01,630
- Probably not serious enough.

249
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,420
- We're not promoting it.

250
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,790
And we're not producing original content,

251
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,050
we're using other content.

252
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,140
So let's make that fix, okay.

253
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:10,660
If you're not following me on Snapchat,

254
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,130
it's a huge mistake 'cause I'm
getting more serious again.

255
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,270
What are you feeling?

256
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,110
- Team GaryVee Instagram,
Spotify playlist.

257
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,450
- Ooh, the Monday to
Monday Spotify playlist.

258
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,850
If you have Spotify and
you've not subscribed

259
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,180
to the Monday to Monday playlist,

260
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,850
it's one of the craziest
fundamental things

261
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,010
you're making a mistake on in your life.

262
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,440
Oh the Wine Club, I haven't thrown--

263
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,640
- I've been enjoying the Wine Club.

264
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,559
- Wait til you fuckin' see.

265
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,769
Everyone's getting February right now.

266
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:44,020
March is fuckin', if you
just want to one off,

267
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,230
if you wanna sign up for
the Wine Club for one month,

268
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,040
make it for March.

269
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,940
By the way, Iris, I want

00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,248
- $55.

275
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:03,494
- $55 delivered, no shipping?

276
00:09:03,494 --> 00:09:04,720
- No shipping.

277
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,080
- I'm gonna put my dad out of business.

278
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,110
Literally, we're getting hammered.

279
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,325
Anyway, love you guys, see ya.

280
00:09:11,325 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat ambient music)
