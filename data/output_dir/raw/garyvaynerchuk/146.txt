1
00:00:01,037 --> 00:00:03,454
(rock music)

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,403
- Good morning, guys.

3
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:08,961
What up, Vlog?

4
00:00:08,961 --> 00:00:11,942
Monday morning, Jets game devastating.

5
00:00:11,942 --> 00:00:13,413
Emotions running high.

6
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,418
Never wanted to care this year.

7
00:00:15,418 --> 00:00:16,515
Don't know how I got suckered in.

8
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:17,348
Classic Jets.

9
00:00:17,348 --> 00:00:20,083
The year that I was thrilled
to go O in 16 and be passive,

10
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:24,156
they suckered me in to break
my fuckin' heart yesterday.

11
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:27,140
That's a little energy
this Monday morning.

12
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,406
Bunch of business reviews,

13
00:00:28,406 --> 00:00:29,895
going out to Long Island, doing a talk,

14
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:31,879
coming back and doing a wine
dinner with a bunch of people.

15
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:32,961
Think we should film a lot of that.

16
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:33,991
Did we get the approval on that?

17
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:34,875
That's gonna be really rad.

18
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,509
I'm sure you're about to watch that,

19
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:38,171
but the 90 day business reviews

20
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:39,938
with all the offices
and divisions of Vayner.

21
00:00:39,938 --> 00:00:41,783
So really, heads down, grinding work.

22
00:00:41,783 --> 00:00:43,357
We'll show you some B roll on that.

23
00:00:43,357 --> 00:00:45,959
Working on a lot of the sneaker stuff,

24
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:49,492
the Gary V001 and 002's are coming.

25
00:00:49,492 --> 00:00:51,909
I'm super excited about that.

26
00:00:53,217 --> 00:00:54,238
Let's go.

27
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:55,071
What's up, guys?

28
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:57,627
Happy Monday, hope everybody's super well.

29
00:00:57,627 --> 00:01:00,866
Fun news, putting a new
sign on the wine library.

30
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:03,137
Big ass sign one the building.

31
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:03,983
You've seen it before,

32
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:04,910
we've got it updated,

33
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,789
and so I'm looking for sign purveyors.

34
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:08,440
If you are a company that sells signage

35
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,711
that goes on buildings,

36
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:11,544
I'd like to hear from you.

37
00:01:11,544 --> 00:01:13,974
Gary@vaynermedia.com, I would like

38
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:15,283
to give you some business.

39
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,712
Looking for the best
service and the best deals.

40
00:01:17,712 --> 00:01:19,706
Keeping it simple, let's do this.

41
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:22,744
Good luck, pass it on to
your sign buddies. See ya.

42
00:01:22,744 --> 00:01:24,820
The number one skill to
have in communication

43
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,805
is the ability to listen.

44
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:29,185
Once you deploy empathy
and listening skills,

45
00:01:29,185 --> 00:01:30,627
you know what to say.

46
00:01:30,627 --> 00:01:35,020
This is the biggest miss
by 99.9% of the market.

47
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,520
(upbeat electronic music)

48
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:06,776
Two hardcore reviews,

49
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:09,899
I'm sure Iris did some cool
time lapse and some rad music.

50
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,704
Now headed to Long Island for an event.

51
00:02:12,704 --> 00:02:14,080
Gonna catch up on phone calls,

52
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,769
bunch of stuff going on there.

53
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:16,611
Good day so far.

54
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:19,263
Solid. Solid amount of work done

55
00:02:19,263 --> 00:02:21,879
in the first couple hours of the day.

56
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,712
- [Man In Suit] Hey, Gary.

57
00:02:22,712 --> 00:02:23,553
That hot wings interview.

58
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:24,386
- [Gary] Thank you, brother.

59
00:02:24,386 --> 00:02:25,382
- [Man In Suit] All those wings, man.

60
00:02:25,382 --> 00:02:26,399
- Thank you, brother.

61
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:27,232
Appreciate it.

62
00:02:27,232 --> 00:02:31,399
Spicy as fuck, but I'm too
mentally strong to waiver.

63
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:36,586
(gentle piano music)

64
00:03:12,997 --> 00:03:14,724
All right, we're getting here,

65
00:03:14,724 --> 00:03:15,688
let's get in here.

66
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:16,757
Let's see what's going on here.

67
00:03:16,757 --> 00:03:17,590
Let's go.

68
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,579
Way back when, I did a
talk for Daymond John,

69
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:23,914
and one of his buddies asked me

70
00:03:23,914 --> 00:03:27,043
to do a talk at his conference.

71
00:03:27,043 --> 00:03:29,515
I said yes, so we're gonna go give a talk

72
00:03:29,515 --> 00:03:30,670
at this conference now.

73
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,665
We'll see what this is all about.

74
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:33,498
Looking forward to it.

75
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:41,134
(applause and cheering)

76
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:44,915
- [Bryce] My name's Bryce.

77
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:46,151
- Bryce.

78
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:49,198
- [Bryce] You kind of touched
on this a little bit already,

79
00:03:49,198 --> 00:03:52,858
but what do you believe holds people back

80
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,971
from just taking action?

81
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:56,594
- Other people's opinions.

82
00:03:56,594 --> 00:03:57,925
- [Bryce] And how do you overcome that?

83
00:03:57,925 --> 00:04:00,022
- By telling your mom
to go fuck themselves.

84
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:02,855
(audience laughs)

85
00:04:04,902 --> 00:04:07,693
(Gary chuckles)

86
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:10,561
Bryce, I'm so hot on this, man.

87
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:14,728
I am so sad that the reason
you get a reaction like that,

88
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:18,870
is a mix between it's
funny to use the word mom

89
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,371
and fuck in the same sentence, right?

90
00:04:21,372 --> 00:04:23,289
But it's way more true.

91
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:27,569
If you listen to the tone
of the laughs in here,

92
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:29,607
and saw what I just saw,

93
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:32,601
the truth in what I just
said is so powerful.

94
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:33,768
I am so sorry.

95
00:04:34,906 --> 00:04:36,688
I am driven by gratitude.

96
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:40,565
I am grateful that my
parents were so awesome.

97
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:44,418
They never made me feel inferior. Right?

98
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,746
And so many of you,

99
00:04:45,746 --> 00:04:48,183
whether through a sibling or a parent,

100
00:04:48,183 --> 00:04:52,063
had a miserable, sad, negative parent,

101
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:54,956
who tried to impose
their negativity on you,

102
00:04:54,956 --> 00:04:56,966
and misery loves company,

103
00:04:56,966 --> 00:05:00,242
and it's greatest execution
is parents on kids.

104
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:01,821
That's something we never talk about.

105
00:05:01,821 --> 00:05:03,716
It's not talked about enough,

106
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:05,757
and so if my legacy,

107
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:07,412
when I die, when I take me last breath,

108
00:05:07,412 --> 00:05:11,185
if you asked me what I
really think I'm gonna think,

109
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,915
I think I'm gonna think
that I was the human being

110
00:05:12,915 --> 00:05:14,727
that came along and brought

111
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:17,228
the most awareness to this conversation.

112
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:19,456
It is my absolute passion

113
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:21,896
because I've seen what
my grandma did to my dad,

114
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:24,339
and I know what my mom did to me,

115
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:26,325
and it's a big fuckin' difference, bro.

116
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:28,028
It's called happiness.

117
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:31,427
So, why do I think a lot
of you don't do shit?

118
00:05:31,427 --> 00:05:35,095
Because you value other
people's opinions of you.

119
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:36,515
Why do I think you have that?

120
00:05:36,515 --> 00:05:39,373
Because you weren't given
self esteem as a kid,

121
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,045
and you're gone the other way,

122
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:42,185
and if there's anything,

123
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:45,288
one of the biggest reasons
I act like a big shot

124
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:47,762
is because I want kids
to become fans of me,

125
00:05:47,762 --> 00:05:50,402
so that I can then become
the shield for them

126
00:05:50,402 --> 00:05:54,159
to have confidence to do
good things, not bad things.

127
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,818
Because if I'm cool,

128
00:05:55,818 --> 00:05:57,299
then they're not talking about Ferrari's

129
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:58,563
and fuckin' gold watches.

130
00:05:58,563 --> 00:06:00,169
They're talkin' about hard work, humility,

131
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:02,083
empathy, and kindness.

132
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,333
(applause)

133
00:06:07,222 --> 00:06:08,055
Did you enjoy it?

134
00:06:08,055 --> 00:06:08,888
- (laughs) Yeah.

135
00:06:08,888 --> 00:06:09,721
- [Gary] Thank you.

136
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:12,409
- [Man In Red] That was a touchdown, dude.

137
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:13,568
- [Gary] It's insane that
they took that from us.

138
00:06:13,568 --> 00:06:16,258
- [Man In Red] I can't believe it.

139
00:06:16,258 --> 00:06:17,984
- Your 60 seconds on why people

140
00:06:17,984 --> 00:06:20,169
can't really get past their fears.

141
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:22,353
- My big thing is that people's fears

142
00:06:22,353 --> 00:06:24,537
are predicated on other people, right?

143
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:27,659
So they are allowing
other people's opinions,

144
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:29,468
you're allowing other people's opinions

145
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:30,850
to dictate your life.

146
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,052
The fear is being judged, right?

147
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:35,430
It's just classic high
school peer pressure.

148
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,228
You actually care about what your dad,

149
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:38,436
or mom, or grandma,

150
00:06:38,436 --> 00:06:39,870
or husband, or wife,

151
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,616
or daughter, or son is gonna say about you

152
00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:43,742
if you do this thing,

153
00:06:43,742 --> 00:06:44,755
which I'm very empathetic.

154
00:06:44,755 --> 00:06:46,887
I care so much about
those people in my life,

155
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:49,440
but I will not allow them
to dictate my behavior,

156
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,309
because ultimately I don't
want to be mad at them,

157
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:55,501
or really have this pent up resentment.

158
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:58,303
So many of you are going to be resentful,

159
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,094
and blame somebody else besides yourself.

160
00:07:00,094 --> 00:07:03,016
It's your fault that you're
not doing your thing,

161
00:07:03,016 --> 00:07:05,175
and so the reason I think it's happening

162
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,945
is the judgment of others.

163
00:07:06,945 --> 00:07:08,013
It's the same shit from fourth

164
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:09,709
and fifth grade that we develop,

165
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,073
and a lot of it has to do
with the parents that you had,

166
00:07:12,073 --> 00:07:14,528
and so I implore everybody to understand,

167
00:07:14,528 --> 00:07:16,743
you only have one life,

168
00:07:16,743 --> 00:07:18,204
and it's much better to live it

169
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,626
for yourself than somebody else.

170
00:07:20,626 --> 00:07:21,694
- Four hundred trillion to one.

171
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:22,593
- That's it, baby.

172
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:23,533
- Appreciate it.

173
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:24,711
- Take care. Buh bye.

174
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,889
Talk is done, we got some
good content in there.

175
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:29,472
Super excited about it. See ya.

176
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:32,816
Hey guys, some breaking
news out of the tech world,

177
00:07:32,816 --> 00:07:35,983
looks like Facebook just acquired TBH,

178
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,206
which has been an app that is
a positive focused polling app

179
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,642
that I've been noticing ranking
very high on the app store.

180
00:07:47,642 --> 00:07:48,636
Here in a TechCrunch article,

181
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:50,977
they're saying TBH has
scored five million downloads

182
00:07:50,977 --> 00:07:55,585
and 2.5 million daily active
users in the past nine weeks,

183
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:57,905
and it's an app that
allows people to answer

184
00:07:57,905 --> 00:08:01,153
kind hearted multiple choice
questions about friends.

185
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:02,983
Positivity on the offense,

186
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,944
kind of the reverse of
what we saw from Secret,

187
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:06,865
and Wisper, and anonymous negative,

188
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:07,890
which is what you normally get,

189
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,670
they created restrictions that
made it anonymous positive,

190
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,301
but the biggest reason
I'm jumping in here,

191
00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:15,562
and I've said it, I have great ambition

192
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:20,115
to be known as an all time
great day trader of attention,

193
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:23,483
right, but nobody in the
corporate world today does

194
00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:26,258
a better job on paying
attention to attention better

195
00:08:26,258 --> 00:08:28,645
than Mark Zuckerberg and
the team at Facebook.

196
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:31,055
Whether it was their
acquisition of Instagram,

197
00:08:31,055 --> 00:08:34,116
and even going back to Friend Finder?

198
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:36,418
Uh, no, what was it that they bought?

199
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,443
Not Friend Finder, maybe Friend Find?

200
00:08:39,443 --> 00:08:40,356
Oh geez, I can't remember,

201
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:42,725
but going back to all their acquisitions,

202
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:46,586
obviously Instagram, obviously
their bid on Snapchat,

203
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:47,930
FriendFeed (snaps fingers),

204
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,214
FriendFeed, remember that?

205
00:08:49,214 --> 00:08:50,657
I think it's FriendFeed,

206
00:08:50,657 --> 00:08:52,594
but nonetheless, thanks Iris.

207
00:08:52,594 --> 00:08:53,753
(Iris laughs)

208
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:55,442
It's so much more fun to
have Iris here than D-Rock,

209
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:56,275
ah but I love,

210
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:57,279
anyway nonetheless,

211
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,163
FriendFeed is right actually,

212
00:09:00,163 --> 00:09:01,509
which is more talent and infrastructure,

213
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:03,934
but attention whether it's been Instagram,

214
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:06,017
or Snapchat, or WhatsApp,

215
00:09:06,869 --> 00:09:10,535
or the way they think about VR and Oculus,

216
00:09:10,535 --> 00:09:12,547
I'm just obsessed with
their ability to do so,

217
00:09:12,547 --> 00:09:16,300
and now another purchase
from the Facebook family over

218
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,008
at Menlo Park, TBH.

219
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:19,424
They're gonna let it run by
itself, the article says.

220
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:20,544
I haven't even read the article,

221
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:22,341
just wanna give my first quick take.

222
00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:24,637
I wanna definitely do some
more breaking news quick takes.

223
00:09:24,637 --> 00:09:26,189
What does this mean?

224
00:09:26,189 --> 00:09:27,282
It means one thing,

225
00:09:27,282 --> 00:09:28,269
that Zucks, and Cheryl,

226
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:30,668
and the rest of Facebook mafia
does it better than anybody

227
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:32,607
in arbitrage and attention.

228
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:34,596
Sometimes they'll miss,
sometimes they'll win,

229
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:36,893
but they're always gonna play

230
00:09:36,893 --> 00:09:39,830
in buying up attention as a platform.

231
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,277
I try to trade it as a creative,

232
00:09:41,277 --> 00:09:42,818
and as a media planner,

233
00:09:42,818 --> 00:09:44,806
and as a personality.

234
00:09:44,806 --> 00:09:46,669
I see what they're doing, and I like it.

235
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,502
(laid back music)

236
00:10:33,873 --> 00:10:36,070
It's unbelievable.

237
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,737
Let me set my piece.

238
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,124
So we're shooting my new K-Swiss sneakers,

239
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:43,138
and Babin literally forgot the sneakers

240
00:10:43,138 --> 00:10:44,679
at the office this morning.

241
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,532
I don't know if we caught it, Iris,

242
00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:46,455
I don't think so.

243
00:10:46,455 --> 00:10:49,339
So before you started filming,

244
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:53,506
I told Tyler literally for
you to give them to Avy,

245
00:10:54,702 --> 00:10:55,564
and be like, we got it,

246
00:10:55,564 --> 00:10:57,152
we got it, and literally right now,

247
00:10:57,152 --> 00:10:58,318
when I was like, "where
is the other pair?"

248
00:10:58,318 --> 00:10:59,701
he's like, "I forgot them at the office,"

249
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,425
I was literally like, "I fuckin' knew it,"

250
00:11:02,425 --> 00:11:03,258
and let me tell you why,

251
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:04,802
VaynerNation, I knew it,

252
00:11:04,802 --> 00:11:06,663
because we are unbelievable,

253
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:08,746
unbelievable at all the hard shit, right?

254
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:10,248
Like everyone's so stunned by our ability

255
00:11:10,248 --> 00:11:12,606
to do so much shit that we do,

256
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:16,679
but we suck shit at the most basic shit,

257
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,825
like bringing the fucking sneakers

258
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:23,796
to the shoot for the shoot
of the fucking sneakers.

259
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:24,651
- Yeah.

260
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,574
- You're shooting my sneakers,

261
00:11:26,574 --> 00:11:28,155
and you forgot the sneakers?

262
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,213
- Basically.

263
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:30,569
(Iris laughs)

264
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:31,504
- Thank you, Iris,

265
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:33,504
for the proper reaction.

266
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,055
- The four people that like me more

267
00:11:37,055 --> 00:11:38,960
than D-Rock just flipped.

268
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,793
(laughing)

269
00:11:39,793 --> 00:11:42,041
- Yeah, like I've literally
been working the last month

270
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,992
to get you six fans,

271
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:46,240
and now back to fuckin' zero.

272
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,073
- Yeah.

273
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,573
- I'm not shooting with these.

274
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,177
I'm upset.

275
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:53,612
I'm not doing it.

276
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,638
We'll have to figure it out tomorrow.

277
00:11:55,638 --> 00:11:56,638
- All right.

278
00:11:59,608 --> 00:12:01,353
- You ever hear of the term cut your nose

279
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,060
to spite your face?

280
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,108
That was the example.

281
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:05,066
(Iris laughs)

282
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:06,728
Babin.

283
00:12:06,728 --> 00:12:07,561
- [Babin] He told me,

284
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:08,510
and I was like getting shit together,

285
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,343
and I just walked out.

286
00:12:17,646 --> 00:12:18,479
- [Gary] That was cool.

287
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:20,729
(laughing)

288
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:24,133
Now Tyler's not picking it up.

289
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,735
- Say what's up to my friend Chris.

290
00:12:33,735 --> 00:12:35,389
- [Gary] Okay, is that
why you're hanging out?

291
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:36,828
- Hey, it's nice to meet
you. Very nice to meet you.

292
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:37,994
- [Gary] Nice to meet you. How are you?

293
00:12:37,994 --> 00:12:38,827
- Very good.

294
00:12:38,827 --> 00:12:39,660
- [Gary] Good, real pleasure.

295
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,493
Hi.
- Hi, Logan.

296
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,326
- [Gary] Logan?

297
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:42,159
- Yeah.

298
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:42,992
- [Gary] Gary.

299
00:12:42,992 --> 00:12:43,825
- [Gary And Logan] Nice to meet you.

300
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:44,658
- [Babin] He's jumped in on
a lot of Vayner Sports stuff,

301
00:12:44,658 --> 00:12:46,139
done a lot of video
stuff for the athletes.

302
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,580
- Thank you, real pleasure.

303
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,579
Oh, you're the Florida dude?

304
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:50,241
Oh, I know exactly who you are.

305
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:51,507
Yeah, that's awesome, man.

306
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:52,642
It's really nice to meet you.

307
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:53,475
- I appreciate that.

308
00:12:53,475 --> 00:12:54,308
- [Gary] Awesome, real pleasure.

309
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:55,141
How are things?

310
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:55,974
- Good. First time in the city,

311
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:56,807
so it's been really cool.

312
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:57,879
- So what, the plan was like...

313
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:58,712
- No, I was like,

314
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:01,170
we're doing a photo shoot.

315
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,258
- I love it.

316
00:13:02,258 --> 00:13:03,316
- [Babin] Because I fucked up, so.

317
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,217
- Guys, Babin has totally fucked up

318
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,565
this entire episode of DailyVEE.

319
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:07,398
- [Babin] Yeah.

320
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:08,231
- But at least we got to meet.

321
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:09,064
- Absolutely.

322
00:13:09,064 --> 00:13:09,897
- Do you want a job?

323
00:13:09,897 --> 00:13:11,100
I've got one short on my video crew.

324
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,933
- Yeah, I'll replace him.

325
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:12,766
I got it.

326
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:13,632
- I gotta do a call.

327
00:13:13,632 --> 00:13:16,104
Nice meeting you, man.

328
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:17,057
It would have been good if you figured

329
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:19,140
it out 19 minutes ago, instead of,

330
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,288
Iris, please make sure
you're filming all this.

331
00:13:21,288 --> 00:13:22,211
Like don't get caught,

332
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:23,794
yeah, you gotta be.

333
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,233
- [Man On Phone] Gary?

334
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:29,650
- [Gary] Yes, good afternoon.

335
00:13:31,054 --> 00:13:32,137
How ya doin'?

336
00:13:34,384 --> 00:13:36,967
(gentle music)

337
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:02,638
Hey, Vlog.

338
00:14:02,638 --> 00:14:04,020
I'm doing my one anti-social move.

339
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,853
Usually before events,

340
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:06,742
I just try to get my
last minute work into it,

341
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:09,159
and so that's what I'm doing.

342
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:23,200
- [Man In Hat] I'm sorry,
but I was just reading

343
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,625
a book called Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook.

344
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,458
(Gary laughs)

345
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,396
So sorry I'm a few minutes late, man.

346
00:14:28,396 --> 00:14:30,096
- [Gary] How are ya?

347
00:14:30,096 --> 00:14:30,929
- [Man In Hat] I love your books.

348
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:31,777
- Thank you, brother.

349
00:14:31,777 --> 00:14:32,959
Thank you so much, brother.

350
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,792
So happy you're here.

351
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:34,625
- [Man In Glasses] Hey,

352
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,458
they're all doing all this other shit,

353
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,291
and I'm like, damn,

354
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,374
when I was a kid and
looking at these guys,

355
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:39,613
none of those guys were
fuckin' hip, but now.

356
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,687
- No 42 year old,

357
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:45,449
you know, I have a
signature shoe come out.

358
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:46,282
- Congrats, by the way.

359
00:14:46,282 --> 00:14:47,115
- Thank you.

360
00:14:47,115 --> 00:14:48,073
Like, that's not how we grew up.

361
00:14:48,073 --> 00:14:50,231
A businessman was a suit, you know.

362
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:51,064
It's crazy.

363
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:51,897
- You are like totally hilarious.

364
00:14:51,897 --> 00:14:53,944
- I'm cooler at 42 than I was at 24,

365
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:55,562
and it's not even fucking close.

366
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,395
- You know, I feel the same way.

367
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,228
I'm 39. I feel the exact same way.

368
00:14:58,228 --> 00:14:59,977
It's such an interesting time for all us.

369
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:02,060
- It's crazy. It's crazy.

370
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,527
It speaks to truth.

371
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:08,358
- But I feel like that truth
didn't even exsist before.

372
00:15:08,358 --> 00:15:10,993
- It didn't, because
it wasn't a truth yet,

373
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:15,321
because the seed of hip
hop didn't scale yet.

374
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,243
It was a baby.

375
00:15:16,243 --> 00:15:18,156
- Yeah, because I feel
like I wouldn't even be,

376
00:15:18,156 --> 00:15:19,234
if it didn't scale,

377
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:20,587
I wouldn't even be still doing it.

378
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,575
- You know what it would be?

379
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:22,408
You know what it is?

380
00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:24,228
It's you and I, probably,

381
00:15:24,228 --> 00:15:25,869
if we were 20 years older,

382
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:27,283
would have been rock and roll kids,

383
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:28,585
because that's what it represented.

384
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:29,451
- [Man In Glasses] Right.

385
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:30,284
- That's all.

386
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:31,352
- Now we're just like...

387
00:15:31,352 --> 00:15:32,426
- I just like our thing better.

388
00:15:32,426 --> 00:15:34,150
I'm really glad that it's that inclusive,

389
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,658
and that authentic, and it's cool.

390
00:15:36,658 --> 00:15:38,132
Yeah, I totally agree with you.

391
00:15:38,132 --> 00:15:39,508
It's wild to watch.

392
00:15:39,508 --> 00:15:40,565
- When you go on stage though,

393
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,711
I feel like you have almost like a,

394
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:43,753
actually to use this as an example,

395
00:15:43,753 --> 00:15:44,586
talking about two people,

396
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:45,742
I feel like it's like watching

397
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:47,466
like DMC at the Gardon in like '86.

398
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:48,603
When you come on stage,

399
00:15:48,603 --> 00:15:50,265
you don't come on like to talk,

400
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:51,472
you come on to kill it.

401
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:55,665
- Kill. I'm completely
affected by those acts,

402
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:57,915
and Richard Pryor, and Eddie Murphy.

403
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,692
Like I'm completely affected by,

404
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:03,409
you know, early hip
hop acts fucked with me

405
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:05,688
because it wasn't that entertaining.

406
00:16:05,688 --> 00:16:07,484
Like rap was funny that way.

407
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:08,317
- Yeah.

408
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:12,439
- Like I was always more about like,

409
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:15,122
they fuckin' deer point, and they kill it,

410
00:16:15,122 --> 00:16:17,020
and there's words, what they meant.

411
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,855
- Right.

412
00:16:17,855 --> 00:16:20,214
- The entertainment value
is a little more difficult.

413
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:22,077
Like the guy in the
back is like, yeah yeah.

414
00:16:22,077 --> 00:16:24,669
Like it's a funny little thing.

415
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:26,212
I think you're right.

416
00:16:26,212 --> 00:16:27,045
- Do you think,

417
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:27,878
one thing I'm working on,

418
00:16:27,878 --> 00:16:29,039
actually I'm curious
what you think about it,

419
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,970
is I'm creating this content series

420
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,294
where I'm actually going
to talking to CEOs,

421
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:36,106
and CMOs about how hip hop inspired them

422
00:16:36,106 --> 00:16:38,821
to create their successful businesses.

423
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:39,913
- Listen, you probably heard it,

424
00:16:39,913 --> 00:16:41,064
because I know you've
seen some of my stuff,

425
00:16:41,064 --> 00:16:44,530
I think hip hop is the foundation of our,

426
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,363
you should 100% explain that.

427
00:16:45,363 --> 00:16:46,196
- [Man In Glasses] I think I'm like

428
00:16:46,196 --> 00:16:47,125
the perfect guy to do that,

429
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,514
because I'm kind of like straddling both.

430
00:16:48,514 --> 00:16:49,489
- [Gary] You'll own that.

431
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:50,448
- [Man In Glasses] Nice.

432
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:51,281
- When you're done with it,

433
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:52,154
come and see me.

434
00:16:52,154 --> 00:16:52,987
We haven't hung out in awhile,

435
00:16:52,987 --> 00:16:54,932
let me look at it and give you some sense.

436
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:55,765
- [Man In Glasses] Cool.

437
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:56,598
Would you be down to talk for it?

438
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,431
Like to do an interview for it?

439
00:16:57,431 --> 00:16:58,264
- For real.

440
00:16:58,264 --> 00:17:00,699
- [Man In Glasses] We just
talk about rap lyrics.

441
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:01,532
I think it'd be fun.

442
00:17:01,532 --> 00:17:02,436
- We should spend more time together.

443
00:17:02,436 --> 00:17:04,682
- You have a great team of
people working with you now.

444
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:05,617
- Thank you, brother.

445
00:17:05,617 --> 00:17:06,999
- [Wine Connoisseur] So
basically here's what I did.

446
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:09,365
I've decanted four of each of these.

447
00:17:09,365 --> 00:17:10,237
- [Gary] Okay.

448
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,285
- At 11:00.

449
00:17:11,285 --> 00:17:12,117
- Love it.

450
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:13,734
- I decanted this one at 11:00,

451
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:15,749
but I brought extras of these

452
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,027
that were not decanted at 11:00

453
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:17,859
so they could pop these,

454
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,504
because what'll happen is
you get all the minerality.

455
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,338
- Of course.

456
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:22,385
- And all the very complex way they

457
00:17:22,385 --> 00:17:25,372
have four different spots
in the armitage for that.

458
00:17:25,372 --> 00:17:26,919
So anyways, you get just a crack here.

459
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:27,752
This is Keller,

460
00:17:27,752 --> 00:17:31,085
and this softens things up a little bit.

461
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:33,954
So basically what I did

462
00:17:33,954 --> 00:17:36,871
was I brought stuff decanted at 11,

463
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,438
and I brought stuff that
hasn't been opened yet.

464
00:17:40,438 --> 00:17:41,560
So I figured we'd do
a little side by side.

465
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,393
- [Gary] Mix it up.

466
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:43,226
Be fun. Be fun.

467
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:44,059
- Just give them a little experience.

468
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:44,892
- Learn.

469
00:17:44,892 --> 00:17:45,725
- What do you think?

470
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:46,711
- Great, I'm a huge fuckin' fan

471
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:48,941
of their wines for a long time.

472
00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:49,774
- [Wine Connoisseur] There you go.

473
00:17:49,774 --> 00:17:51,734
Now this is Jolee.

474
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:53,362
- I had him on Wine Library TV.

475
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:54,195
- Oh you did?

476
00:17:54,195 --> 00:17:55,028
- [Gary] It was the best
interview I ever had.

477
00:17:55,028 --> 00:17:55,861
- No way.

478
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:56,694
- [Gary] I love him.

479
00:17:56,694 --> 00:17:57,527
- I hear he's a whack
job, I've never met him.

480
00:17:57,527 --> 00:17:58,672
- Whack fuckin' job.

481
00:17:58,672 --> 00:18:01,205
It was suppose to be 15, 20 minutes.

482
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,544
It was an hour and 13 minutes.

483
00:18:02,544 --> 00:18:03,377
- Whoa.

484
00:18:03,377 --> 00:18:04,210
- I'll never forget, I missed my,

485
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,043
I didn't even go to the
city for a tasting I

486
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,355
was supposed to go to,

487
00:18:06,355 --> 00:18:07,274
because we had such a great time.

488
00:18:07,274 --> 00:18:10,857
I mean, I'm obsessed
with this guy's stuff.

489
00:18:13,324 --> 00:18:14,339
It's gonna be interesting.

490
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:15,172
- It's gonna be very interesting.

491
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:17,129
- [Gary] To see how they react to it.

492
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:17,962
How are you?

493
00:18:17,962 --> 00:18:18,795
- [Danny] Hi, I'm Danny.

494
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:19,628
- [Gary] Gary.

495
00:18:19,628 --> 00:18:20,461
- [Danny] Nice to meet you.

496
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:21,294
- Nice to meet you, Danny.

497
00:18:21,294 --> 00:18:22,192
Cool stuff.

498
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:23,359
- So this guy.

499
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,927
- Cool ex motor oil.

500
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:26,929
- I did decant them at 11,

501
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:29,588
because I did need to get
rid of some of that girostal.

502
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:30,421
- That stuff.

503
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:31,254
- I knew there was gonna
be a little too much.

504
00:18:31,254 --> 00:18:33,087
- For everybody, yeah.

505
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:36,168
This is fuckin' gangster.

506
00:18:37,138 --> 00:18:40,388
What's crazy about this, it's so crazy.

507
00:18:42,813 --> 00:18:44,877
So fun to get back into the wine kick.

508
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:46,320
Brother, I'm glad we did this.

509
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,153
- Let's rock and roll, man.

510
00:18:47,153 --> 00:18:48,495
- The two gentlemen on the bookend.

511
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,384
In the big high chairs,

512
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:51,018
in the arm chairs, I'm sorry.

513
00:18:51,018 --> 00:18:53,431
Matt and Dave said, let's talk about wine,

514
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:54,503
because that was organic,

515
00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:56,951
and then Gary said, "Souza."

516
00:18:56,951 --> 00:18:57,784
Well, actually Souz.

517
00:18:57,784 --> 00:18:58,617
They call me Souz.

518
00:18:58,617 --> 00:18:59,450
"Come over here.

519
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,583
"Let's do a wine dinner."

520
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:01,915
So, I've been working on this,

521
00:19:01,915 --> 00:19:03,659
obviously with two ridiculous schedules,

522
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:04,710
and all of yours,

523
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,410
and we're here today to do that, so enjoy.

524
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,707
- I mean, what's going on
on Instagram right now is,

525
00:19:10,707 --> 00:19:13,445
I would argue, grossly underestimated

526
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:14,579
by the majority of us,

527
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:16,398
maybe including me, who spends eight hours

528
00:19:16,398 --> 00:19:18,381
a day trying to figure it out.

529
00:19:18,381 --> 00:19:21,645
We've got culture living
through this platform

530
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:24,593
at a scale that I think makes people,

531
00:19:24,593 --> 00:19:25,612
I just don't think people understand

532
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:26,515
what's actually happening,

533
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:30,726
which is the amount of
actual net attention

534
00:19:30,726 --> 00:19:33,159
on this platform speaks to a time where,

535
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:34,084
looking around the room,

536
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:35,145
a lot of us grew up,

537
00:19:35,145 --> 00:19:38,154
when there was less channels, you know.

538
00:19:38,154 --> 00:19:40,568
You know, yo MTV raps.

539
00:19:40,568 --> 00:19:41,401
Looking around the room,

540
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:42,356
knowing a lot of people around the room,

541
00:19:42,356 --> 00:19:44,068
so impactful, right?

542
00:19:44,068 --> 00:19:45,913
White kid in medicine, New Jersey,

543
00:19:45,913 --> 00:19:48,480
that was the propaganda I
needed to get into the culture.

544
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,333
I just think Instagram is
stunningly underestimated.

545
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,208
Did you see what he did today?

546
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,291
The guy trades attention.

547
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,620
He bought TBH today.

548
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,183
Like every behavior out of his actions

549
00:20:03,183 --> 00:20:05,850
is buying and trading attention.

550
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:07,725
That's all he does.

551
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:09,604
I met him in 2008.

552
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:10,605
- [Diner] What's TBH?

553
00:20:10,605 --> 00:20:11,547
- It's this kids app.

554
00:20:11,547 --> 00:20:14,048
Do you remember Secret and Wisper?

555
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:14,881
- [Diner] Yeah.

556
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,353
- Yik Yak, all these viral apps,

557
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:20,315
the reason they all failed
is when you were anonymous,

558
00:20:20,315 --> 00:20:23,816
the lowest common denominator
of human behavior kicks in,

559
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:25,548
and it's really fun to
say something anonymous

560
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:26,702
about your neighbor,

561
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:28,482
until somebody says something about you,

562
00:20:28,482 --> 00:20:30,333
and then everybody leaves.

563
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,828
TBH went the other way.

564
00:20:31,828 --> 00:20:33,043
It was anonymous,

565
00:20:33,043 --> 00:20:35,961
but it was forced positivity.

566
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:39,183
So you would do a poll and
little things about people,

567
00:20:39,183 --> 00:20:40,897
but you had to say something good,

568
00:20:40,897 --> 00:20:42,397
which created virality,

569
00:20:42,397 --> 00:20:44,865
because people liked hearing
nice things about themselves

570
00:20:44,865 --> 00:20:46,367
from anonymous sources.

571
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:47,841
It became huge with teenagers.

572
00:20:47,841 --> 00:20:50,020
It's the number six app in
the app store right now.

573
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,603
- Gary, he's a brother
from another mother,

574
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:58,043
super amazing dude, love him so much,

575
00:20:58,043 --> 00:21:00,916
responsible for me being here today,

576
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,316
and I really appreciate him,

577
00:21:02,316 --> 00:21:04,251
and being here tonight.

578
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:05,203
Thank you, Gary.

579
00:21:05,203 --> 00:21:06,036
- [Gary] Thanks, brother.

580
00:21:06,036 --> 00:21:06,999
I gotta run.

581
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:07,832
- [Diner] I have to give you something.

582
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:09,643
- Please, next.

583
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,480
Reach out.

584
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,290
Robert and I are now heading to Harlem,

585
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,178
because that's how we do.

586
00:21:16,178 --> 00:21:17,573
We're gonna do a little bit of chef,

587
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:19,447
little Marcus Samuelsson,

588
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:20,806
little Harlem action, Robert?

589
00:21:20,806 --> 00:21:22,701
- Yeah, Marcus Samuelsson,

590
00:21:22,701 --> 00:21:24,260
we've been involved with
food and wine all week.

591
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,630
Listen, he's like can't
come to your amazing dinner,

592
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,463
but you gotta come to mine.

593
00:21:28,463 --> 00:21:29,296
I've never invited anybody,

594
00:21:29,296 --> 00:21:30,487
but I wanted you and Gary to come.

595
00:21:30,487 --> 00:21:31,320
- Harlem.

596
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,462
- Like love you.

597
00:21:32,462 --> 00:21:34,840
- [Gary] We know a lot of connectors.

598
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,970
Like we're all living life.

599
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,045
The amount of connectors who
don't have intent to trade

600
00:21:41,045 --> 00:21:45,136
on the connection in the
short term barely exist,

601
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:47,886
and that's why I appreciate Souz.

602
00:21:55,886 --> 00:21:56,856
Hey guys, wrapping up,

603
00:21:56,856 --> 00:21:58,618
gonna send Iris home,

604
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:00,791
because it's late already,

605
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:04,249
it's 10:00, and we've got two
hours here at the Red Rooster.

606
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:05,815
Bunch of people from Food and Wine,

607
00:22:05,815 --> 00:22:07,049
gonna see some old friends,

608
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:08,283
gonna do some networking.

609
00:22:08,283 --> 00:22:11,897
You know, no matter where you get to,

610
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,099
you've always gotta do a little hunting,

611
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,398
a little farming, a little networking,

612
00:22:15,398 --> 00:22:16,281
a little shaking hands,

613
00:22:16,281 --> 00:22:18,281
a little kissing babies.

614
00:22:19,265 --> 00:22:21,788
Just very grateful for
the life I'm living,

615
00:22:21,788 --> 00:22:23,055
and more importantly for the attention

616
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:24,019
that you guys give me,

617
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:25,818
and so I hope you have a wonderful day.

618
00:22:25,818 --> 00:22:26,899
Iris did a great job today,

619
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:27,754
it was a great day.

620
00:22:27,754 --> 00:00:00,000
See you guys later.
