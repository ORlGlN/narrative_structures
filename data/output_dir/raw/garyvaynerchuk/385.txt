1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,461
- Wrapping up with a long day.

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:03,253
Oh my god!

3
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,966
(yelling and exclaiming)

4
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:08,800
Holy shit!

5
00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:12,086
Definitely a 
different kind of DailyVee.

6
00:00:12,086 --> 00:00:14,826
("Monday to Monday" by Saba)

7
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:24,974
Saba, I've been telling you.

8
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,871
- [Man] Can I help you guys?

9
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,415
- [Gary] It's the way 
to collect a lot of data.

10
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,501
- [Woman] Just be careful.
- [Gary] No worries.

11
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:43,335
- [Woman] It's 
not like I expect you

12
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,628
to, like, cut through the walls.

13
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:48,799
- [Gary] Yeah, 
I wasn't gonna. (laughs)

14
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,846
Hey guys, first of 
all thank you so much

15
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,516
for listening to my podcast,
it means the world to me.

16
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,142
That little buzzing sound 
you hear in the background

17
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,812
is I'm in some sort of 
weird utility closet right now

18
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,022
about to go live 
stream at Salesforce,

19
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,315
but I wanted to 
set up this clip.

20
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,484
This is maybe the 
single most important clip

21
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,319
I've ever put out on my podcast.

22
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,239
So, I hope you enjoy it. 
Pay very close attention.

23
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,450
And I love you.
(laughs)

24
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,576
Yeah, I love you.

25
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,661
Sure, DRock.

26
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,163
I'm about to do a live stream,

27
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,167
you know, live cast

28
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,630
with Salesforce 
for sales executive

29
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,050
and startup and large
companies and I'm excited.

30
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,219
I'm also reading the 
Dont'a Hightower resigned

31
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,799
with the Patriots 
instead of the Jets

32
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,681
which actually makes me happy.

33
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,851
I didn't want to overpay for him
and I've enjoyed hating him.

34
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,512
It would have been a 
tough transition to loving him.

35
00:01:43,512 --> 00:01:47,190
Good morning, good afternoon,
good whatever you call it

36
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,330
wherever you are. 
Good to see you.

37
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,838
Big ups Rich.

38
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:53,905
Snyder Mike, my man, 
Snyder Mike,

39
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:57,826
congrats on Dont'a Hightower
resigning with the Patriots.

40
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:01,830
Ooh, yeah, that's right. 
Macho Man Randy Savage.

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,710
Savage, baby. So, I'm 
here at Salesforce.

42
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,839
And I am about to do a live...

43
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,885
Why can't I figure 
out what it's called?

44
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:17,429
Live stream? It's a live stream.

45
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,764
Anyway, I'm 
looking forward to it.

46
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,849
DRock's here, as always.

47
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,477
What do you guys call this?

48
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,187
Like, what is it 
officially called?

49
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:28,065
A live stream?
- [Man] A web cast?

50
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,817
- A web cast. 
I think it is a web cast.

51
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,860
- [Host] So, Gary,
- [Gary] Yes?

52
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,737
- [Host] You have a 
really interesting background.

53
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:37,324
Obviously, moving into 
the U.S., the baseball cards,

54
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,326
the Wine Library, perhaps 
for some of the people who

55
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,538
are not familiar with yourself, 
can get an intro.

56
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:42,829
- [Gary] You know, it's fun.

57
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,790
Right now I'm very much 
known as a marketing guy,

58
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,666
a social media 
guy but the truth is,

59
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,168
at the end of the day, 
and it's why I really wanted

60
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,962
to do this today is 
I'm a sales guy, right?

61
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,673
I mean, from the age 
of five with lemonade,

62
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,260
and I mean a five 
lemonade stand franchise.

63

("Understand" by 
Bazanji Ft. Eve Devonport)

65
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:32,087

Put the logo up as it is.

This is amazing.

68
00:03:57,962 --> 00:04:00,493
My man, I have some fun news.

69
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,531
- [DRock] Is there a reason

70
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:43,130
that the bracket's 
so important to you?

71
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,994
- I've just have 
always liked it.

72
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,083
In the eight grade I got really
into the NCAA tournament.

73
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,941
Oh, actually, yeah 
there is a reason.

74
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:57,047
My freshman year of 
high school I predicted that

75
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,967
the Richmond Spiders 
were gonna beat Syracuse

76
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,692
and it was a fifteen 
to two seed game

77
00:05:03,692 --> 00:05:06,139
and it was one of the 
first time it ever happened

78
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,850
and I went all around 
my high school the day of

79
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,185
and I would get into class early

80
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,437
and write "Richmond 
Spiders," because we were

81
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,482
a northeast school, 
Jersey, Syracuse was big,

82
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,275
it was a monster 
upset and, like,

83
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,570
the whole school knew 
who I was the next day.

84
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,949
They were like "Some 
short freshman predicted it."

85
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,451
And, like, teachers 
would pull me outta class

86
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,787
for, like, betting 
and it became my signature

87
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,914
moment of my freshman 
year and so I think

88
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,123
that's probably what...

89
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:36,294
Oh, and I also ran the pool in
school junior and senior year

90
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:40,674
Here's a good racket: 
I had a crazy game.

91
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:46,471
Junior year it was a 
bag with 32 pieces in it,

92
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,224
which were the first round
game and you get both teams,

93
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:52,477
10 bucks to enter and 
the winner got 200 bucks

94
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,487
and I got $120.

95
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,858
Senior year I upped 
it up and I made one team

96
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:03,738
on the cards, 64, and the
winner got $400 and I got $240.

97
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,491
(DRock laughs)
So, freshman year

98
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,995
I shocked the 
school with my prediction,

99
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,746
sophomore year I can't 
remember anything,

100
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:16,167
junior year I ran the pool,
senior year I ran the pool.

101
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,919
Yeah, the tournament's 
always been big.

102
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,715
- [DRock] So that's 
a staple in your life?

103
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,968
- The first Thursday 
was actually one of the only

104
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,803
weird days I would 
actually take off.

105
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,263
If I was talking 
about missing no days,

106
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,807
I would leave at noon 
and watch the first games.

107
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,475
I haven't done that in about
seven or eight years, though.

108
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,686
It's gotten crazy 
but I used to do that.

109
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,187
- Hey, is it okay 
if I Snapchat with you?

110
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,022
- Of course.

111
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,232
- I'm coming to 
your thing tomorrow.

112
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,066
- How are you?
- Doing well.

113
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,985
How are you?
- Good. Oh!

114
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:44,779
Awesome.
- Awesome.

115
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,614
- [Gary] A real pleasure.

116
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:46,448
- I can't wait 
to see you tomorrow.

117
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,199
- [Gary] Thank you, 
talk to you soon.

118
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,242
(laughs)

119
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,036
- This is your sign, 
but we're like...

120
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,121
- [Gary] That's a big ass 
sign. What's up, buddy?

121
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,372
(whoops)
Good to see ya.

122
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,749
- You ready to party?
- I'm ready.

123
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,042
- Nice to meet you.
- Real pleasure, man.

124
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,209
How are you?
- Good.

125
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,044
- [Gary] Good, man.

126
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,671
- [Shonduras] This is 
the DRock, DRock's the man.

127
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,672
- [DRock] Good to meet you.

128
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,548
- [Shonduras] 
Figure out our situation,

129
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,885
change all our flights, came
back, dude, just hustlin'

130
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,845
We went to, like, 
four different skate parks

131
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,305
in a giant Greyhound 
bus with my whole

132
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:13,224
space station crew, got 
home, dropped everyone off,

133
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,976
immediately got in my car and
then came and picked you up.

134
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,311
That's why I'm 
running a bit late.

135
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:20,065
- [Gary] I love it, man.
- This is us right here.

136
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,483
- Find some room.

137
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,361
Package acquired.

138
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,943
- DRock, GaryVee.

139
00:07:26,943 --> 00:07:29,199
- [Gary] Here, present.

140
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,076
- Gary, you realize 
that we're not going

141
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,285
to Hustle &amp; Grind right now,

142
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,287
we're going to a 
Giant Wave to Surf.

143
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,205
- That's what I heard.

144
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,500
You guys know that I've never
surfed in my entire life?

145
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,834
- [Shonduras] That's why 
we're doing it, dude.

146
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:40,710
- Like anything even remotely--

147
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,671
- [Tanner] And it's so much 
different than real surfing.

148
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,255
- [Shonduras] Any time
I've ever hung out with you,

149
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,423
you were just 
like, getting work done,

150
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,758
we're having good conversations,

151
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:47,592
like, I want none of that.

152
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,177
I just want to see you surfing.

153
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,970
- I want to see myself surfing,

154
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,349
like, I've never 
done anything of balance,

155
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,018
like, no skate boarding, 
no surfing.

156
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,520
- [Shonduras] This is 
gonna be great.

157
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,479
- This is gonna be 
really interesting.

158
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,313
- [Shonduras] So I 
was like, I need some really

159
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,231
good clickbait 
with GaryVee I bet if

160
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,065
I put him on a surf board

161
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:02,941
I'd be like 
"Gary breaks his leg"

162
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,317
or something, like, viral video.

163
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,151
- I'm really hoping.

164
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,444
- Yeah, that's 
what I'm going for.

165
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,278
- I'm looking for content.

166
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,113
- That's business right there.

167
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:08,947
- Content.

168
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,699
- His name is also 
Sean, so it gets weird,

169
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:11,866
so we just call him Holiday.

170
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,701
- [Gary] Got it.

171
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,077
- I met him in 
Honduras, so technically,

172
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,412
Shonduras as well.

173
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,246
- [Gary] Wow.

174
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,080
- I know, right?

175
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,914
- [Holiday] Like, I didn't know...

176
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,332
- [Gary] You guys 
made up Holiday? Or...

177
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,166
- No, that's his last name,

178
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,000
- Last name.

179
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,918
- Yeah, it's his last name.

180
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,753
Then he's like my Alex, dude.

181
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,547
Like, my life would 
not exist without him,

182
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,590
he's got me like, when 
we got snowed in and stuff,

183
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,967
he's like "You're going here!
Now you're going in here!"

184
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:29,801
- [Gary] I remember.

185
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,261
- We had to jump out of 
our Uber on the freeway,

186
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,679
change Ubers, go to 
a different airport.

187
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,514
- [Tanner] Like, 
straight up an island

188
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,347
in the middle of the freeway.

189
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:36,182
- [Shonduras] Like, 
New York City was nuts.

190
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,015
- I love it.

191
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:38,433
- Yeah, it was, dude, the past
two days have been insane.

192
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:40,728
My buddies What's Inside
they live in Utah,

193
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:41,938
we're all hanging out.

194
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,598
It's gonna be 
like, ultimate party.

195
00:08:44,598 --> 00:08:45,775
- [Gary] And Tanner, 
what about you, man,

196
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,653
like, what was your story?

197
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,613
I know you crush YouTube, 
but like, how did it start?

198
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,907
- Originally, I was a 
professional scooter rider,

199
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,284
so I like, went to 
the skate park every day

200
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,535
for the last five years.

201
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,203
Just doing that, and I traveled,

202
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,788
like, all around for contests,

203
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,248
and then from there--

204
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,416
- Scooter, you said?

205
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,250
- Yeah.

206
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,293
- What does that mean?
I want to make sure.

207
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,502
- Like, a Razor scooter.

208
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,378
- Like Razor scooters.

209
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,546
- Yeah, but like, more pro.

210
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,464
- Yeah, okay, got it, 
yeah, I've seen that.

211
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,298
- It's the same thing as BMX.

212
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,340
Yeah, so I did that.

213
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,467
- That's cool.

214
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,801
- Yeah, I did that for
five years, and then--

215
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,886
- How old are you now?

216
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,555
- 17. From there, I started
vlogging, and then--

217
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,389
- When was that?

218
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,474
- I just started for fun,

219
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,225
but that was a 
year and a half ago.

220
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,060
- Go ahead.

221
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,936
- So I had a little bit 
of a following from scootering.

222
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:22,729
- Yep.

223
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,954
- And then I just 
kept vlogging for fun

224
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:25,440
and then I had a video 
that went kind of viral.

225
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,142
- Yep.

226
00:09:26,142 --> 00:09:27,317
- So then I got a bunch 
of subscribers really fast

227
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,151
and then from there--

228
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:28,985
- What was the video about?

229
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,195
- Hoverboards.

230
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,446
So then from there, I like,

231
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,198
I made it more about me,

232
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,742
and then I slowly transitioned 
away from scootering

233
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,659
and then more just about me

234
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,244
so that I could like, 
keep the same fan base.

235
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,078
- Yep.

236
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,498
- And then just grew 
it and kept doing it,

237
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,833
and now I've been doing it
daily for the past eight months.

238
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,293
But before that, 
I did every other day.

239
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,127
- Understood.

240
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,295
- Real talk about 
this, though, like,

241
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,255
I mean, skateboarding's
rough, cement, all that stuff.

242
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,590
Like, this is fun, 
like you can do it,

243
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,800
it doesn't hurt to 
fall or anything like that,

244
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,301
the body surfing's super fun.

245
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,761
- [Gary] I like pain.

246
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,012
(laughing)

247
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:56,971
I like losing, man.

248
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,432
Like, I like that shit.

249
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,434
Meaning, I don't 
like all that stuff

250
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,852
because I don't have time.

251
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,521
Like, the same 
reason I don't golf,

252
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,773
I just don't 
have time for anything

253
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,316
because I just love what I do,

254
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,609
but, like, as 
soon as we get there,

255
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,236
I'm going to be focused as fuck.

256
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,738
(group laughter)

257
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,240
I'm not gonna be 
like, "Oh, this is lame."

258
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,491
You know what I mean?

259
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,409
DRock, you need Wifi 
to post today's episode?

260
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,244
- [DRock] Yeah.

261
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,788
- [Shonduras] We got good 
Wifi at the space station.

262
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,789
Space Wifi.

263
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,332
- But we're first going 
to that other place, right?

264
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,959
Does that place have Wifi?

265
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:26,835
- [DRock] I can upload them--

266
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,002
- 'Cause what, it's already 11?

267
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,003
- [DRock] I'll do 
it on my phone.

268
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:29,921
- What time is it?

269
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,632
- [Tanner] It'll be 11, yeah.

270
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,217
- [Shonduras] Oh.

271
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,344
- Somebody from the company
just asked me why the draft,

272
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,888
why the March Madness 
thing is mandatory.

273
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,723
I said it'll be in 
tomorrow's DailyVee.

274
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,559
DRock just asked 
me the same question.

275
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,394
I make the whole 
company fill out a bracket

276
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,228
for the tournament.

277
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,062
- What's the March,

278
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,772
so I got a couple 
tweets, like Casey Neistat,

279
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,691
GaryVee, March Madness, 
is there an actual thing

280
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:50,525
with influencers, or like

281
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,609
that's just 
something in the company?

282
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,861
- Maybe there's 
something, but for me,

283
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,070
I'm not in any of that.

284
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,947
It's a VaynerMedia 
thing, that's been like,

285
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,199
like the winner, 
like I sent to Australia,

286
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,409
like, I make it a whole...

287
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,339
- [Shonduras] Just have fun.
- Yeah.

288
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:03,050
- [Shonduras] Yeah.
- It's a big deal.

289
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,123
I like that I'm 
tagging Layton, Utah,

290
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:08,209
this is when you get 
people like "What the fuck!"

291
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,107
- [Shonduras] Yeah, exactly.
- They're in Layton, Utah.

292
00:11:10,107 --> 00:11:11,683
What's that, brother?

293
00:11:11,683 --> 00:11:12,797
- Are you into cars?

294
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,560
- No.
- No?

295
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,061
- Nah, I'm super like,
not cool that way, like--

296
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:16,634
- [Shonduras] No, me too, man.

297
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,802
It's so hard 'cause 
all these people talk cars.

298
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,636
- You love cars?

299
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,470
- Yeah.

300
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,680
- Yeah, I don't give a 
fuck about cars at all.

301
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,349
- [Shonduras] I know, 
like, good cars have NOS.

302
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,183
- He goes, "You like cars?

303
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,435
"Yeah, I don't give 
a fuck about cars."

304
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,061
- [Shonduras] That's like, 
my attitude exactly,

305
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,521
except for I edit it.

306
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,856
- Like, people are like "Yo!"

307
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:30,690
- [Shonduras] I don't 
give a rat's about cars.

308
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,859
- "This fucking car can 
do this," I'm like, yeah.

309
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:33,776
Like, yeah, but I get it.

310
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,987
Like, that's the 
best part of the world.

311
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,364
But I love people 
that are into shit.

312
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,824
Like I love when 
my friends are like

313
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,784
"Look under the hood," 
or know how fast it is

314
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,203
or give a fuck 
about tires and shit.

315
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,830
(group laughter)

316
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,664
I think that's awesome,

317
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,498
because I get it, like,

318
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,543
I'm into like, I'm 
into, fucking, like,

319
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,503
going to garage sales 
and like, finding like,

320
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,130
toys from the '80s and being like

321
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,257
"Yo I bought this for 50 cents
and I sold it for six bucks"

322
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,134
and that fucking gives me

323
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,969
the greatest, 
like, fucking rush ever.

324
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,304
It's 7:57.

325
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,056
- [Shonduras] 7:57, 
we've got 30 minutes.

326
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,641
This is the best place 
to eat in the entire world.

327
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,975
- [Gary] So let's eat it.

328
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:06,809
- [DRock] Right now?

329
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,770
- I'll do it here.

330
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,146
- [Shonduras] Tanner 
doing a back flip.

331
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:10,980
- Ready?

332
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,566
- [Shonduras] Yeah!

333
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,400
- [DRock] Yes!

334
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,235
- [Gary] Jesus!

335
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,321
How does that feel?

336
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,155
Okay?

337
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,033
How about there?

338
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:22,867
How about there?

339
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:23,701
- More!

340
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,535
- That hurts, right?

341
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,370
- Yeah.

342
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,204
- Dude.

343
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,205
- Dude, Gary could drop you!

344
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,040
- No, seriously, 
it's crazy, right?

345
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,667
- The best part is I 
had no idea about anything.

346
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,627
Today I was like, 
"What am I doing?"

347
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,964
Literally, like 
when I got off the plane.

348
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,131
Off the plane!

349
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:38,925
- When you were like 
"I don't have a swim suit"

350
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,677
I was like "Wait, does 
Gary know what we're doing?"

351
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:41,844
- 45 minutes ago I was 
like "What am I doing?"

352
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,262
What are you gonna do?

353
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,097
- Try a front flip.

354
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,056
- I don't know 
how to front flip.

355
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:45,890
- I can teach you.

356
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,724
- I'm gonna 
break my fucking neck.

357
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,767
- Don't jump too high

358
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,851
because you don't 
know how to do it yet.

359
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,228
But you just kind of jump.

360
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,312
- This is like, the 
end of me, right now.

361
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,146
- Tuck your head in.

362
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,607
- Go ahead, alright, go ahead.

363
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,651
- That's you, dog!

364
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:57,485
- I want to see you do it.

365
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,903
Let me just, I...

366
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,950
One more time, you 
and then I'm ready to go.

367
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,784
(cheering)

368
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,618
- Holy shit!

369
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,452
- [Shonduras] One with no hands!

370
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,204
You got this, one more no hands.

371
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,330
- I don't, that's 
literally the first time

372
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,623
I've ever did that in my life.

373
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,457
- Gary's getting 
extreme in here.

374
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,667
- Ever. Ever in my life.

375
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,336
I don't even know what happened.

376
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,213
- Good hands, a little better,

377
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,008
go a little bit under the back.

378
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,551
(cheering)

379
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,385
- Holy shit!

380
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:25,847
Oh my god.

381
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,640
- Gary just goes off in Utah!

382
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,516
- I'm pumped. That was good?

383
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,642
- [Shonduras] Alright, 
let's go indoor surf.

384
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,852
- Is that good?
- [DRock] Great.

385
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:34,076
- That was the most extreme
thing I've ever done in my life.

386
00:13:40,474 --> 00:13:42,613
Not our normal thing, DRock.

387
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,866
(cheering)

388
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,866
("Waves" by Shallou)

389
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,338
- [DRock] You're welcome.

390
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,844
- GaryVee versus wave.

391
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,345
- [Gary] I've now learned that

392
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,805
the front foot is the back foot

393
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,057
and the back 
foot is the front foot

394
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,642
and I'm making slight progress.

395
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,436
Love that footage.

396
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,688
- [David] That looks great.

397
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,198
(cheering)

398
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,055
- Oh my God! What is life!

399
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:54,185
- Guys, I'm an 
extreme sports superstar.

400
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,478
- Yes.

401
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,271
(laughing)

402
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,815
- Learning to 
fall's super important.

403
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,441
- Yeah, definitely.

404
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,193
- Yeah, I mean I should...
(laughs)

405
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,153
You guys should 
have told me that before.

406
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,448
The first, literally 
the first fucking time

407
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,493
my elbow exploded 
all over my fucking body.

408
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,328
I feel like I'm a 
cross between Kelly Slater

409
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,123
and Tony Hawk at this point.

410
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,249
- [Shonduras] Alright, 
this is the part

411
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,126
where we take you 
guys to the space station.

412
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,544
You ready for some 
space station, Gary?

413
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,087
- He gets to ride the drift car.

414
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,965
- The drift cars. Professional
fun-haver training camp.

415
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,925
- [Gary] I think my stomach's 
more like Vin Diesel.

416
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,593
(group laughter)

417
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,179
God, yeah, you know what? 
I'm really in the mood now.

418
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,849
I'm trying to, like, 
will it into the universe.

419
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,184
I'm, like, trying to 
will my vibes right now

420
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,895
towards two kids in 
Kansas to invent some sort

421
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,023
of crazy-ass...
I hope they call it Shmuga.

422
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,859
Since that's what 
I always say. Yeah.

423
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,111
Follow me on Shmuga!
- What do you do on the Shmuga

424
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,112
(Gary laughs)

425
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,698
- I'm a huge shmuger.
(group laughter)

426
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,324
- I used to run my 
business out of my basement.

427
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,993
I upgraded to here, 
brought the basement with me,

428
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:52,994
brought 
everything from the basement,

429
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,453
brought it here, made it better.

430
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,289
This is just, like, 
random property to play with.

431
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,874
Green screen.
We' re really into VR,

432
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,000
mixed reality, right now.
- Yep.

433
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,946
- So, playing a video game,
we film it, layer in the game

434
00:16:00,946 --> 00:16:03,045
so it looks like 
you're inside the video game.

435
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,840
Gaming, the VR 
computer, this is Brandon.

436
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,674
(high-five)

437
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,676
Brandon works on brand 
deals, special projects,

438
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,344
- [Gary] A pleasure.
- VR stuff.

439
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,512
This is where Holiday sits.

440
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,764
Holiday runs my entire 
life, he's my schedule,

441
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,184
call, calendars, everything.

442
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:20,021
This is Pookie, he runs 
my second You Tube channel.

443
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,439
- Nice to meet you.
- [Gary] Nice to meet you.

444
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,648
- Sorry, everybody's 
got their own, weird name.

445
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,691
Like this is Pookie, 
that's what his mom

446
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,776
used to call him 
so I just adopted it.

447
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,612
He runs the second 
channel with challenger stuff.

448
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,031
This is me, this is Tall 
Chicken, he's been with me

editing the best day ever vlogs.

- That's the team.

452
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:41,834
Outgoing, dude, we write
back almost every single fan.

453
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,045
Look at that, 
that's outgoing, dawg.

454
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,214
- I'm proud of ya on that..
- There it is.

455
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,798
Charging table, cereal wall.

456
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,842
In case you didn't know 
I really, really like cereal.

457
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,761
And then fans send us cereal
so these are all from fans.

458
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:55,097
They write on them, 
they draw their own cereals.

459
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,058
- How do I go backwards?

460
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,060
- This is not like a real 
car where you're yanking it

461
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,228
and turning it. 
That's, like, backwards.

462
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,896
It's just little 
turns like this, okay?

463
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:02,813
- [Gary] Little turns.

464
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,396
- So turn it this 
way, there's your gas.

465
00:17:04,396 --> 00:17:05,201
- Alright.

466
00:17:05,202 --> 00:17:07,108
- [Shonduras] I'm 
gonna get ya set up.

467
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:09,278
(engine starts)
- Holy shit.

468
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,405
It's got juice.
- Okay, see where you are?

469
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,990
It's not there, it's right here.

470
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,531
Kinda just go into 
the corner real quick

471
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:16,826

- Alright.

little control there.

Nice drift cart test. Good job.

00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,386
(crashes)
- Oh!

513
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,721
- Yes! That's 
Gary's mark! (clapping)

514
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,348
Yes, Gary left 
his mark right here.

515
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,391
(laughing)

516
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:47,228
- [Tanner] Now just 
go backwards and pull it.

517
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,896
- That was pretty good.

518
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,064
- [Tanner] Did 
you get it, DRock?

519
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:50,898
- [DRock] Yeah, I got it.

520
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,150
- DRock, that was a solid shot.

521
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,154
- I need you to sign 
that mark right there.

522
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:57,988
- [Tanner] There 
it is, right there.

523
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,615
- Bam.

524
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,033
- [DRock] That's 
GaryVee's mark.

525
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,326
- [Tanner] Not bad, huh?
- [Shonduras] Forever.

526
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:06,497
- [Tanner] Not 
bad at all. (laughing)

527
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,961
(laughing)

528
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,049
- [Gary] DRock, can 
you upload the episode?

529
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,676
Hey, man, how 
are ya? (boy giggles)

530
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:19,510
- Good, man, I'm Dan.

531
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,886
- Dan, such a 
pleasure. How are you?

532
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:21,846
- Doin' great.

533
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,848
- I love how I'm 
wearing the Macho Man shirt.

534
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,308
- [Dan] Dude, Macho Man. Yeah.

535
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,270
- [Gary] Yeah, 
fast forward a little.

536
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,148
Yep, this is it. He did it.

537
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,274
I'm the best at this.

538
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,109
See, you go like this.

539
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,027
- Like you're flipping them?

540
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:37,862
- Yeah.

541
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,029
- And you try to take 
the other person's pencil?

542
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,950
- Yeah. Like, you 
go: (pencil snaps)

543
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,743
- Alright.
- Oh my god!

544
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,911
- [Shonduras] Brandon's 
got the goods.

545
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,745
- My god.

546
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,123
- [Brandon] Okay, Gary.

547
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,958
- [DRock] Hold on, 
what are we doing?

548
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,377
- Pencil fighting.
- I have no idea what this is.

549
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,587
I didn't do this, 
Gary's teaching here.

550
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,838
- [Gary] Lower.
- [Shonduras] Lower.

551
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,673
Oh, I see you're 
going for that metal too.

552
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,301
Oh, that hurt me. That hurt me.

553
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:03,971
Oh, wait, I 
can't move it. (sighs)

554
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,264
Ooh. What about the firmness?

555
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,140
Like, do you 
have to hold it firm?

556
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,475
- Yep.
(all laugh)

557
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:08,309
- [Shonduras] Oh, pencil lost.

558
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,894
- [Gary] He was 
broken on the inside.

559
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,229
(exclaiming)
I lost my eraser.

560
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,191
When you lose your eraser
that's when you're in trouble.

561
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,151
- [DRock] Once that 
inside's broken you're done for.

562
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,987
- [Tanner] How are 
you doing that?

563
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,573
(pencil snaps)

564
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,452
- You're in trouble, 
I cracked you. Yep.

565
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:27,286
(laughing and exclaiming)

566
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,370
- [Shonduras] Nobody 
has it, nobody has it.

567
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,956
- Let me have it. Oh, 
how did that stay alive?

568
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,959
(laughing)
- There's the lead!

569
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,669
- Alright, who's next?

570
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,546
- [DRock] Why you 
scaring the kid, Gary?

571
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,631
- I will destroy 
this kid. (gasps)

572
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,383
- [Shonduras] This is next 
level strategy here.

573
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,760
- Oh, I am 
worried it's gonna break.

574
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,221
Like, I keep feeling it 
more and more.

575
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,055
- [Shonduras] Where 
did it come from?

576
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,640
Like, how old were you 
when you were doing this?

577
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,768
- Mid '80's. Like, this 
was the mid '80's big thing.

578
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,603
Ready?
- [Tall Chicken] Let's go.

579
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,772
- [Shonduras] Wait, 
we're just warming up?

580
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,107
- [Gary] Oh my god! 
That was a huge shot.

581
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,109
I'm in trouble.

582
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,904
I lost my eraser I should 
be finished by now.

583
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,240
Ow!
(laughs)

584
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:09,787
(exclaiming)
Oh, I'm in trouble.

585
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,789
I feel the internal bleeding.

586
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:12,790
(laughing)

587
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,877
- You better be ready 
for a victory lap, DRock.

588
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,088
- Ooh, I don't know about this.

589
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,548
(sighs)

590
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,758
(pencil snaps)
Oh!

591
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:26,095
- This is where boys 
become men right here.

592
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:30,224
(pencil breaks)
(exclaiming)

593
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:31,809
- What you gonna do?

594
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,186
Bret "The Hitman" Hart 
is considered

595
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,230
the excellence of execution.

596
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,982
He's one of the all 
time great wrestlers.

597
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,150
He comes from a big 
time wrestling family.

598
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,694
I was an '80's baby.

599
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,071
In the '80's he was 
part of a tag team called,

600
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,197
The Hart Foundation,

601
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,241
with Jim "The Anvil" Neidhart.

602
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:50,119
And then he eventually 
became a solo wrestler.

603
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,036
- [Shonduras] Right now.

604
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,079
Who is this guy?

605
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,747
- [Gary] And became a 
big time solo wrestler

606
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,542
and when he left 
WWF to go to WCW,

607
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,253
he was supposed to 
gracefully kind of leave,

608
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,589
but Vince McMahon screwed him
- [Shonduras] Duh.

609
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,173
- And he made Shawn Michaels

610
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,759
beat him--
- I remember Vince McMahon.

611
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,469
and it made it seem 
like Shawn Michaels,

612
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,846
the way it was choreographed,

613
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,540
Bret the Hitman Hart was 
supposed to kick out

614
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,809
of the move, 
which was the Sharpshooter,

615
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,477
which was his own move,

616
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,854
Shawn Michaels had him in it,

617
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:19,940
but McMahon made the 
ref call it making it seem

618
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,443
like Bret submitted 
to his own move.

619
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,111
Bret like spit on him,

620
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,112
it was a whole to do.

621
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,113
- [Shonduras] Wow.

622
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,990
- But he's one of the 
great wrestlers of all time.

623
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,368
And it's really awesome 
that he's on this signature.

624
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,579
I'm pretty hard core about saying

625
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,456
that nobody is 
really my business idol,

626
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,374
but when I'm forced into it,

627
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,209
I do say that Vince McMahon

628
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,170
and Walt Disney are two 
people I think a lot about

629
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,713
because they're storytellers.

630
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,548
I mean I you really think
about what's happening here,

631
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,759
the cereal like 
if you even look at,

632
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,179
even the new age 
stars of social media,

633
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,889
actually are much more grounded

634
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,183
in the old storytelling of like

635
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,392
you're creating pillars,

636
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,602
pencil fighting,

637
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:57,728
cereal,

638
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,688
you're just 
creating these genres

639
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,732
these worlds you live in.

640
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,859
What Vince did extremely well,

641
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,653
WWF as I call it,

642
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:06,528
now WWE.

643
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,365
Is he owned the naming rights
to all these characters.

644
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,283
He invented these characters.

645
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,743
Him and his inner crew.

646
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:13,786
They invented,

647
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,162
you know, Mr. Perfect.

648
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,081
They invented Demolition,

649
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,958
they invented The Undertaker.

650
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,502
And then they owned the IP,

651
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,420
so there's a human being who's

652
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,298
Brutus the Barber 
Beefcake or Hillbilly Jim

653
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,634
or Junkyard Dog or Iron Sheik.

654
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:31,387
But they don't 
own the IP, he does.

655
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,806
And that IP goes on to 
be worth a lot of money,

656
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,973
and so, he's an 
extremely strong storyteller.

657
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:37,267
And what he did,

658
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,102
which I loved,

659
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,812
was he took a regional business,

660
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,397
wrestling in the early '80's

661
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,607
going all the way 
back to the '40's and '50's,

662
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,692
was regional.

663
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:45,818
So there was like,

664
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,236
the northeast league,

665
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,487
and the south league,

666
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,863
and wrestlers 
like Andre the Giant

667
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,408
would go and travel 
in different places.

668
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:55,160
What he did was turned 
WWF into a national player

669
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,067
by being smart

670
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:59,206
and understanding cable 
television distribution,

671
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,166
Saturday morning distribution,

672
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,127
MTV distribution,

673
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,421
and Saturday Night Live,

674
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:06,797
there used to 
be something called

675
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,257
Saturday Night's Main Event,

676
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,092
which would run 
once every eight weeks

677
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,093
instead of SNL.

678
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,594
And he just built a whole world.

679
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,847
Wrestlemania, 
his invention really,

680
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,473
besides boxing,

681
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,559
created the 
Pay-Per-View industry.

682
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,227
He's a real pioneer.

683
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,895
- [Shonduras] I thought it 
was just a bunch of dudes

684
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,439
going hard in the ring.

685
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,481
I had no idea.

686
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,566
- You know what's so funny?

687
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:26,734
So much of what we do today

688
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,944
even when you're 
like, "Hey Snapchat crew,

689
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,780
"I'm about to unveil 
my video on YouTube."

690
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,906
I just watched 
some of your content.

691
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:33,741
- Yeah.

692
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,492
- Well that's what 
Vince literally invented

693
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,494
before big wrestlers 
that he would sign

694
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,830
would come to the WWF.

695
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,749
He would do these 
little monologues like

696
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:42,958
Razor Ramon's like

697
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,752
"I'm coming for you Macho Man."

698
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,378
And for like 
weeks every Saturday,

699
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,172
you're like, "Wait a 
minute this guys coming!"

700
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:49,798
And then by the 
time he finally shows up,

701
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,633
in like week nine,

702
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,719
you already thought 
he was the coolest.

703
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:57,306
So he would play that 
build up better than anybody.

704
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:00,726
And now you see a lot of those
behaviors in social media.

705
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,145
Which is like, "Tomorrow I'm
going to drop this thing,"

706
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,583
or every 10th of 
the month one of your

707
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:06,940
pieces of clothes, right?

708
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,358
One of the greatest 
matches of all time.

709
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,693
If you Google it right now,

710
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,654
every top 10 list is 
Macho Man Randy Savage

711
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,281
versus Ricky The 
Dragon Steamboat,

712
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:17,910
Intercontinental Championship,
Wrestlemania 3 I think?

713
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,787
- It was definitely three.

714
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:23,957
- And it was like a 40 
minute match because they were

715
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:27,586
both so great at improv, 
like they just had a cadence

716
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,670
with each other.

717
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,672
It's kind of like 
a dancing partner.

718
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,800
- [Shonduras] They went 
for 40 minutes just?

719
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,052
- I like boxing a lot as well,

720
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,595
and there's this 
saying in boxing, like,

721
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,805
styles make fights, right?

722
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,890
So like you can 
have two great fighters,

723
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,059
best in the world, and 
all of us would fall asleep

724
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,781
by the eighth round, 
and you could have two guys

725
00:26:43,781 --> 00:26:46,030
that are okay but 
they just matched.

726
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,857
Macho Man and Ricky The Dragon
Steamboat, their styles,

727
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,527
just, there was something, 
I mean, look at this,

728
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:52,736
this is real, you see it?

729
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,154
- [Man] Oh my gosh!

730
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,281
- Like literally, just 
talking about it gives me,

731
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,200
look at this, like literally.

732
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,118
Like literally 
goosebumps, literally.

733
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,330
- [Shonduras] He's got 
real goosebumps. (laughs)

734
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,874
- I'm telling you 
like I'm sure you're like,

735
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:10,958
it's almost worth 
signing up for WWE Channel

736
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:13,215
just to have access 
to watch that match,

737
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,466
it's that all-time.

738
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,802
- All right we have the 
power team assembled here,

739
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,220
with the wrestling belt.

740
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,722
This is Bret The 
Hitman Hart, The Undertaker,

741
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:24,560
and Howard Finkle, he's the
longest tenured employee of WWE.

742
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,311
- This is what we do.
- This is what we do.

743
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,855
- That's so funny.

744
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:29,898
We cut stuff open.
- That's amazing.

745
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,358
- Okay guys.

746
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:35,529
(saw whirring)
Hold her tight!

747
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:36,363
Oh!

748
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,914
- Completely normal!

749
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:48,208
(cheering)

750
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,626
- Oh!
- Yeah!

751
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,836
- Smells awesome.

752
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:53,046
(laughing) Smells 
like that big dude's hair.

753
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,298
- [Shonduras] That's 
just creepy.

754
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:56,182
- Smells good too.
Did you smell it?

755
00:27:56,182 --> 00:27:57,843
Dude smell it.

756
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,052
- [Man] Like it smells good.

757
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,763
(laughing)

758
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,307
- I can never cut this hair.

759
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:04,433
- It's really good hair,

760
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,018
if I had that 
hair I'd be dominating.

761
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,477
(laughing)

762
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,313
- Yeah, I got your 
half, there you go.

763
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:10,397
- Oh you do, 
thank you very much.

764
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,523
- Lincoln, your half.

765
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,275
Successful cut!

766
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:14,318
- Yes!

767
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:15,777
- [Shonduras] Don't remove 
the gold, I want it forever.

768
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:16,862
- Seeing the inside 
of a wrestling belt,

769
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:17,905
was that fun, Lincoln?

770
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:21,867
- What you gonna do when Lincoln
comes to run wild on you?

771
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,286
(laughing)

772
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,829
- [Shonduras] Are you sure you 
don't wanna go there's like

773
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,290
skydiving, like 
anything, you good?

774
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,541
- Finished.
- You done?

775
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,043
- Finished.
- No VR rollercoaster?

776
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:34,004
- This is the creepy room.
- This is super creepy.

777
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:35,923
- Don't worry about it.

778
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:40,135
- Hello? (laughing)

779
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,470
- Cool, cool.
- Awesome.

780
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,221
- Thanks.
- Such a pleasure.

781
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,431
- Nice to meet you.

782
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,517
- Let me get one, 
right here, hometown.

783
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,311
- Gary, space station, 
how was it?

784
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,729
- The best.

785
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,314
- The best, 
check out my boy Gary.

786
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,690
- I love you guys.
- Instagram, YouTube,

787
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,858
everything, the best.

788
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:55,817
- Best.

789
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,487
- Oh my gosh it 
worked, we got it.

790
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,447
- Amazing hospitality 
from this man.

791
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,199
- Space station high five guys.

792
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,533
- High five guys.

793
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,785
- Nice meeting you.
- Dude, yeah.

794
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:05,702
Anything I can help, reach out.

795
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:06,620
- Thank you, I appreciate that.

796
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,663
- Seriously.
- You too.

797
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,498
If you ever want, need 
help growing your whatever.

798
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:10,457
(laughing)
- come on!

799
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,708
- Sorry, sorry!

800
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:13,502
I didn't know that was his.

801
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:14,503
- Later man.

802
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:15,837
- [Gary] Nice to meet you.

803
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:16,672
- [Shonduras] Call me.

804
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,093
- [Gary] Real pleasure.
- Thank you, take care.

805
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,845
- [Shonduras] This is the end.
- [Gary] Such a pleasure.

806
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,111
- Can I hug you?
- [Gary] Of course, brother.

807
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:27,140
- Good, I appreciate it.
- Of course.

808
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,225
- We appreciate it.

809
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,059
- Hi!
- How's it going?

810
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:29,893
- How are you?
- Good, good, good.

811
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:30,727
- Such a pleasure, 
what's your name?

812
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,164
- I'm Christina.
- Christina, such a pleasure.

813
00:29:32,164 --> 00:29:34,815
- We live in Salt Lake City, 
so we decided that we

814
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,943
would drive 35 minute 
for like the 17% chance

815
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,403
of possibly meeting you.

816
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,905
- Yeah, it was super 
saw it on like 17--

817
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,865
- It was super weird 
'cause we were like hiding

818
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,575
over there in the woods.
- [Gary] Are you kidding?

819
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,786
Not at all don't 
worry, such a pleasure.

820
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,162
- I wanna give you a hug.
- [Gary] Please.

821
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,249
Thank you so much.

822
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:52,916
- [Man] This is ultimate combo. 
We gotta get down there.

823
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,251
- That's good.
- That's awesome.

824
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,627
- Can you do the whole 
like, you're gonna die thing?

825
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,628
- Heck yeah, this is for you.
- Wait, what?

826
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,838
I don't even know 
what this thing is.

827
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:58,839
You're gonna die thing?

828
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,757
- Somebody asked me like,

829
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,634
somebody asked me like, hello.

830
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,636
- Hey, he's gonna die, one sec.

831
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:08,265
- Driving 35 minutes is 
like what you do, right?

832
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,475
It's like you get one
shot, this could deal--

833
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,852
- [Christina] Just wanna say
we appreciate you for sure.

834
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:12,894
- Very sweet.

835
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:17,024
Yeah I mean listen, I don't
know how to play this game

836
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:20,610
without recognizing 
that we get one shot,

837
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,488
you get these one experiences,
this is like the one time

838
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,408
all of us, this dude, 
what's your name?

839
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,284
- Alex, nice to meet you.

840
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:28,785
- Alex, really nice to meet you.

841
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,204
This is it, this 
like the, this is 100%,

842
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,998
I'm gonna say, 
looking at the mix of people,

843
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,624
our one time being all together.

844
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,752
- [Shonduras] We nailed it!
- We crushed it!

845
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:44,926
Wrapping up a long day.

846
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,639
Defininitely a 
different kind of DailyVee.
