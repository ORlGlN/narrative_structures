far in L.A., big day.

Big promotion day 
for Planet of the Apps

4

later with a 
little bit of a party.

And you're gonna get 
some real footage there, huh?

6
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,946
Did you get 
clearance to be there?

7
00:00:48,946 --> 00:00:49,897
That'll be interesting.

energy around creating new IP?

13
00:01:06,643 --> 00:01:07,788
Is it 'cause the studios don't

14
00:01:07,788 --> 00:01:10,370

more fun with guaranteed--

that we could exploit,

17
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:16,550

spot for them to work.

18

And...

00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,913

just rebooting right?

20
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,282

fucking excuse for not doing.

So many of you are using 
it as a high-brow excuse.

really fucking pisses me off.

'Cause people think they're
being clever and hiding it.

Oh, I'm a perfectionist, 
I do it right.

You don't do it right, Dick.

You're not doing it at all.

That's the problem, you're
doing it right theoretically

38
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,234

never put anything out.

Not subjective.

What was subjective 
was should it been 86

54

or should it been 82?

55

That's where you 
had to make a call.

56
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,510
People are crippled 
to not make calls.

57
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,745
So, they don't 
end up doing anything.

58

And then all you fuckers who
use perfection as a disguise,

you think you're 
smarter than everybody.

tricking the losing players,

my business partners,

I see it with my start,

67
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,701
no, no, no, 
it's gotta be perfect.

68
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,736
I'm so close to 
having it perfect.

69
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:27,207
No you're not, you just 
don't want to get it done.

I like low-brow excuses.

that dude the other day

That's honest.

like, "Oh you know,

to get it exactly right

right it will win."

it" like "I'm an artist.

to you real quick,

you posted my song man

Every time I see 
you you on a plane.

- I live at the airport.

95
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:26,566
So what's been going 
on man, how's it going?

96
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,935
- Honestly, I've 
just been grinding.

97
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,203
You know, like 
really smashing it.

98

Just drop, 
after drop, after drop.

And each time I drop something,

100
00:04:32,743 --> 00:04:34,174
I mean I can see 
the numbers go up.

101
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,776
So, you know, the consistency
it kinda feeds my--

102

- How often, once a week, 
once every two weeks?

103
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:40,580
- Last week 
I dropped three songs.

- Last week?

105
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,883
- Yeah, last week 
I dropped three songs.

106
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,985
A week before that 
I dropped two songs.

107
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,887
And it's usually 
one a week, but I just,

108
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:47,958
I'm just really 
trying to pump 'em.

109

sure that something--

- Is your mind in the 
place where I'm at which is,

111
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,023
it's just a matter of time.

It's literally just once--
- 100 percent.

want to drop two or three is

114
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:57,888
it gives you more 
chance for have that song

115
00:04:57,888 --> 00:04:59,850
that changes everything.
- Exactly. Exactly, it's--

116
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,635
- It's a numbers game.

117
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,503
- Yo it really is, it 
really is a numbers game.

118

- I believe that man.

119

one what was that?

- Yes, dude, yo and 
this isn't to take any shots

124
00:05:13,587 --> 00:05:16,356
because it's a bunch of 
amazing factual information.

125
00:05:16,356 --> 00:05:18,292
The biggest thing 
I took out of that book

126
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:22,663
is pinpointing why I have been
so confident and successful

127
00:05:22,663 --> 00:05:24,398
and it is because of 
how my mom raised me.

128
00:05:24,398 --> 00:05:26,400
And I was never able 
to put my finger on that

129
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,202
until I saw you 
say it in that book.

130
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,303
I was just like you know.

131
00:05:29,303 --> 00:05:31,173
- That makes sense.
- It literally, thanks to my mom

132
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:32,408
I feel like I can do anything.

133
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:33,342
- It's the best.

134
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:34,277
- I feel like she pumped 
me full of this confidence.

135
00:05:34,277 --> 00:05:35,875
And I never pinpointed it--

136
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,446
- Did you call 
her and say thanks?

137
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:38,781
- Yes I really did.

138
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:40,582
She's my reason for everything.

could be for my

Forever.

("Doo Wop" by J.I.D)

201
00:08:53,543 --> 00:08:55,401
So our commercial just aired.

202
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,538
My phone's blowing 
up, so that's cool.

203
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,106
And let's see what,

204
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,178
let's see what the buzz is.

205
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,647
Jason, I will 
never be big time, baby.

206
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,016
I'll always be a 
boy from Belarus.

207
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,561
Appreciate the love.

208
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:15,422
I could swear I just heard
your voice in the NBA game.

209
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,458
You know, it's funny.

210
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,603
This is a really 
interesting scene

211
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,896
because the 
event's going on inside.

212
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,032
Everybody's 
drinking a vodka martini

213
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,135
and I'm on Twitter 
engaging with everybody

214
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:33,406
who just saw the commercial 
during the NBA Finals.

215
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,542
It's just so fucking,

216
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,710
this right here is 
the difference moment.

217
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,646
I'm not in it for 
the glitz and the glamor.

218
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:40,480
I'm in it for the fucking,

219
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,224
the blood and the dirt.

220
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:45,004
Everybody can go party it up.

221
00:09:45,004 --> 00:09:46,753
I'm fuckin' here workin'.

222
00:09:49,642 --> 00:09:51,002
Okay.

223
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,594
It's still just a commercial.

224
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,463
Not that much chatter.

225
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:57,297
- [DRock] Really?
- Yep.

226
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:00,767
People don't get it, man

227
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,570
but let's not for this party.

228
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,104
- Who's that?

229
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,973
- It's me, it's GaryVee.
- Who's that?

230
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,007
- What?

231
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,076
- I've heard of this guy.

232
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:12,545
- I'll teach you, Jess.

233
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,147
That's what I'm here for.

234
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,749
(upbeat music)

235
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,254
- [Woman] Terrible.

236
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:24,357
- [Man] Look handsome together.

237
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,226
- [Gwyneth] Alright, photos.

238
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,560
- Come here for a selfie.

239
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,931
Keavis, Get out of the photo.
- I didn't know.

240
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,367
- Alright.
- Is this a Snapchat?

241
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,969
- [Man] I kinda 
wanna be in that picture.

242
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:36,970
- [Jessica] I'm the greatest.

243
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,571
- Jess, why are 
you the greatest?

244
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,939
- 'Cause I was born that way.

245
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:40,773
- Born that way.

246
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:41,733
