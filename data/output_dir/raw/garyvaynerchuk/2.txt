1
00:00:03,122 --> 00:00:05,705
(baaing sheep)

2
00:00:07,871 --> 00:00:10,720
- They're all calling you dad.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,720
(classical guitar and keyboard)

4
00:00:27,845 --> 00:00:28,865
- Gentlemen, would you like to start

5
00:00:28,865 --> 00:00:30,805
with some onion rings as an appetizer.

6
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:32,210
Or maybe our bacon sampler,

7
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,660
which is five pieces of bacon

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,026
from all over the United States.

9
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:36,884
- Yes please, two bacon samplers, please.

10
00:00:36,884 --> 00:00:38,634
- Two bacon samplers?

11
00:00:40,803 --> 00:00:45,720
(classical guitar and keyboard with beats)

12
00:00:53,912 --> 00:00:55,400
- '94 Dickerson.

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,233
- Ya.

14
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:57,133
- You know anything about.

15
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:00,031
- Ya, they're great, they're a
little bit on the green side.

16
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:00,864
- Which is fine.

17
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:01,697
- It's a cool vintage.

18
00:01:01,697 --> 00:01:02,530
- Ya, I remember.

19
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,829
- But it's still Joel
Peterson that made it.

20
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:05,649
It's great stuff.

21
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,139
- Do you think we need to decant it?

22
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:07,972
- You can.

23
00:01:07,972 --> 00:01:09,082
- Or do you think pop and pour's better.

24
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:11,357
- Um, we taste every bottle,

25
00:01:11,357 --> 00:01:13,760
so I initially make a decision
and then we can consult.

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,669
- Okay cool.

27
00:01:14,669 --> 00:01:16,567
- So let's grab it, I'll pop
it, and we'll talk about it.

28
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:18,234
- Thank you so much.

29
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:21,234
- I mean, there's so much old wine

30
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:25,164
that I'm just like, like this
'94 Ravenswood Zin Dickerson

31
00:01:25,164 --> 00:01:29,920
was like, a wine a remember
selling when I was a kid.

32
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,657
You know, I was like,

33
00:01:31,657 --> 00:01:35,254
this is gonna be really good wine one day.

34
00:01:35,254 --> 00:01:37,609
Let's find out if I was right.

35
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:39,476
Hey guys, so these
couple vlogs are gonna be

36
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:41,873
a little bit different,
a little more vague,

37
00:01:41,873 --> 00:01:43,982
because we're working
on a very secret project

38
00:01:43,982 --> 00:01:45,134
that I'm super excited about.

39
00:01:45,134 --> 00:01:46,872
I mean, look at Trouty's face,

40
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:48,872
look how secret this is.

41
00:01:51,337 --> 00:01:52,911
But as you can imagine, if
you've seen some of the photos

42
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:55,724
on Instagram, put that up,

43
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:56,801
I think it's gonna be a very big deal,

44
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:58,787
I think you're gonna be
super excited about it.

45
00:01:58,787 --> 00:02:00,647
I can't wait to announce it to all of you,

46
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:03,086
and so these two episodes I think

47
00:02:03,086 --> 00:02:04,287
are going to really stand out

48
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:08,176
as a little different
side of me and my life,

49
00:02:08,176 --> 00:02:10,376
and the world I play in.

50
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:11,411
And I think we're challenging ourselves

51
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:12,403
to show a little bit more of that.

52
00:02:12,403 --> 00:02:15,088
We're so focused on giving value,

53
00:02:15,088 --> 00:02:17,977
and it's really about
a motivational mindset

54
00:02:17,977 --> 00:02:22,554
or a tactic, or giving you an
insight in to what I'm doing.

55
00:02:22,554 --> 00:02:25,154
I've been seeing a lot more
of you tweeting things like,

56
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:26,720
you know, watch what
Gary's doing, whether it's

57
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,956
a Monday to Monday playlist or things.

58
00:02:27,956 --> 00:02:29,690
Don't be scared Clay, get in here.

59
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,266
You can fix the meat while I'm ranting.

60
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:32,760
I'm almost done,

61
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,796
- Ya, I'm just.

62
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:36,521
- You do meat, I'll do this.

63
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:39,370
And so, that's what these
two episodes are about,

64
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,688
and I hope you enjoy them,

65
00:02:40,688 --> 00:02:43,002
and I think value in the
vlog can come in the form

66
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:45,684
that 99% of the vlogs on YouTube have,

67
00:02:45,684 --> 00:02:47,129
which is just entertainment,

68
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:49,962
and escapism, lightweight
just getting to know people,

69
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:53,474
and hopefully DRock and Bobby Babin

70
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:56,445
can do a good job editing these episodes,

71
00:02:56,445 --> 00:02:58,265
and show you a little bit of those angles

72
00:02:58,265 --> 00:02:59,098
that I don't think,

73
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:02,402
I think we agree we don't show enough of.

74
00:03:02,402 --> 00:03:06,235
I'm way more funny than
you guys post edit me.

75
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:09,965
- [DRock] Well, you have more time now.

76
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:11,286
- Be funny right?

77
00:03:11,286 --> 00:03:13,599
You know what, that's an
interesting insight, DRock.

78
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,456
Colin, write an article.

79
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:17,191
Monday morning, a lot of you checked out,

80
00:03:17,191 --> 00:03:20,826
and enjoying President's Day, not me,

81
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,243
I'm up to some secrets, shhh.

82
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:37,968
(laughing)

83
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,912
- [Clay] They give them to you

84
00:03:39,912 --> 00:03:40,771
as a season ticket holder.

85
00:03:40,771 --> 00:03:42,958
So, what can I do, I don't
have small kids anymore,

86
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,541
nobody wanted them.

87
00:03:45,873 --> 00:03:48,048
You hate the Warriors?

88
00:03:48,048 --> 00:03:49,205
- I just like the Knicks.

89
00:03:49,205 --> 00:03:50,535
(laughing)

90
00:03:50,535 --> 00:03:51,368
How much money.

91
00:03:51,368 --> 00:03:52,201
- Who said you L L C?

92
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:53,179
- I'm just a very big investor.

93
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:55,121
I always play for the long haul,

94
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:58,546
so early on, most of my
companies make no money.

95
00:03:58,546 --> 00:04:01,233
And in one meeting, I was like,
look you don't understand,

96
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:04,400
we're making goose egg, nothing, zero.

97
00:04:05,815 --> 00:04:06,648
- I lost.

98
00:04:06,648 --> 00:04:08,831
- It was a very formal meeting with like,

99
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,235
billion dollar executives in ties,

100
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:13,485
I'm like fuckin' goose egg.

101
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:18,426
I was into it by summer I was like,

102
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:20,093
that wasn't too bad.

103
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:23,583
It feels so weird to have a lot of time,

104
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,833
I was antsy in the meeting.

105
00:04:36,054 --> 00:04:37,869
- You're gonna have so
much fun with that story,

106
00:04:37,869 --> 00:04:40,233
about explaining, like in
three minutes you explain,

107
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:42,340
or two minutes, explaining how fucked up

108
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,779
the wine business is,
you know how many people

109
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:45,612
don't understand that.

110
00:04:45,612 --> 00:04:48,332
- When that clip plays in 40 years.

111
00:04:48,332 --> 00:04:50,237
When this whole cycle goes down,

112
00:04:50,237 --> 00:04:51,758
I'll enjoy that so much.

113
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,572
- Ya, that'd be cool.

114
00:04:53,572 --> 00:04:55,472
So many people don't understand
what you were saying.

115
00:04:55,472 --> 00:04:56,507
- I know.

116
00:04:56,507 --> 00:05:00,545
- The rule, some bullshit
law from prohibition in 1930

117
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:04,800
has caused a dysfunctional
liquor and alcohol business

118
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,699
in this country.

119
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,146
- What time's our meeting?

120
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:11,771
- Well 3:30, so we're
supposed to be there now.

121
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:12,802
- So let's get there.

122
00:05:12,802 --> 00:05:13,832
How far away are we?

123
00:05:13,832 --> 00:05:15,442
- 10 minutes, eight minutes.

124
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:16,775
- Ya, no coffee.

125
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,516
If there's an archery
store, we'll stop by,

126
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:22,876
other than that.

127
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:24,115
(laughing)

128
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,532
- I love archery.

129
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:29,293
(laughing)

130
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:35,103
- He didn't see it, he didn't see it.

131
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,633
How good was that?

132
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:39,524
- I didn't know Gary was into archery.

133
00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:41,667
- That was amazing.

134
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:43,688
- Last time he was here I
don't think he had a beer.

135
00:05:43,688 --> 00:05:44,594
- Oh, I probably did, what's up?

136
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,427
- How are you, man.

137
00:05:45,427 --> 00:05:46,260
John, good to see you again.

138
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,093
- You too.

139
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:47,926
- Hey man, Gary.

140
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:48,759
- Gary, Adam.

141
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,592
- How are you, Adam.

142
00:05:49,592 --> 00:05:50,425
- Nathan.

143
00:05:50,425 --> 00:05:51,258
- Nathan.

144
00:05:51,258 --> 00:05:52,091
- Or Nate, whatever you wanna call me.

145
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:52,924
- Nice to meet you.

146
00:05:52,924 --> 00:05:53,853
- Daven.

147
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,686
- What's the name?

148
00:05:54,686 --> 00:05:56,250
- Daven.

149
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,775
- Thanks for seeing us.

150
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:58,767
- This is Duke,

151
00:05:58,767 --> 00:05:59,677
- Hey, Duke.

152
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:01,094
How are ya buddy?

153
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:05,554
- They're running a business here, John.

154
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:08,402
(laughing)

155
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,342
That's back to my thesis,

156
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:12,119
which is we're talking about Merlot.

157
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:14,057
We're talking about the
right bank of Bordeaux.

158
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:16,659
This is historic, this
is high quality wine.

159
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:18,275
One fuckin' movie.

160
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:19,108
In?

161
00:06:20,635 --> 00:06:21,468
- [Male Off-Screen] Ya.

162
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:22,301
- Two.

163
00:06:22,301 --> 00:06:23,134
- [Male Off-Screen] Year and a half.

164
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:25,217
- Just two really, right?

165
00:06:27,675 --> 00:06:28,508
What up?

166
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:29,341
Ya, two.

167
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:33,604
That's when he came in?

168
00:06:33,604 --> 00:06:34,594
- [Male Off-Screen] That
was the first one I did.

169
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,200
- [Gary] That's good man, that's early.

170
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,524
- The Rock just texted me.

171
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:40,551
(laughing)

172
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:42,416
- [Male Off-Screen] Are we
getting coffee around here guys?

173
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,768
- Guys, we'll get coffee when Avi says

174
00:06:44,768 --> 00:06:45,601
we're gonna get coffee.

175
00:06:45,601 --> 00:06:46,793
- [Male Off-sScreen] I'm in, I'm buyin'.

176
00:06:46,793 --> 00:06:49,769
- When Avi has a Burger King on his side.

177
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:51,503
(laughing)

178
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:52,533
- Is he a Burger King guy?

179
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:53,655
- No, there's one right there.

180
00:06:53,655 --> 00:06:56,426
I often reference what's in front of us.

181
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:58,531
- Archery and Burger King.

182
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:01,781
- Guys Bennett Realtors was the reason.

183
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:04,556
- Trouty's goin' deep.

184
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:05,919
- Trouty's diggin'.

185
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:06,752
Now we're seein'.

186
00:07:06,752 --> 00:07:10,379
Here we go, want coffee,
but I want it from something

187
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:13,879
that's on our side, that doesn't veer off.

188
00:07:15,287 --> 00:07:17,287
I don't like the U-turn.

189
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:21,536
And if we don't have anything,
we don't have anything.

190
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:23,152
If he dies, he dies.

191
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:24,225
Starbucks!

192
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:25,301
There it is.

193
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:26,134
- Yay.

194
00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:27,301
- On our line.

195
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,233
- What.

196
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:31,647
- We gotta make a right, and then.

197
00:07:31,647 --> 00:07:34,371
- No, it's a huge shopping center.

198
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:37,011
I feel like Avi missed
it, let's keep going.

199
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:37,844
Look I think the biggest thing,

200
00:07:37,844 --> 00:07:40,559
first of all, I'm glad we
were able to make this happen.

201
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:42,382
I'm glad you texted me Victor.

202
00:07:42,382 --> 00:07:43,952
And it's good to see
you, brother, I miss you.

203
00:07:43,952 --> 00:07:46,844
Ah, class, listen, the opportunity,

204
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:48,832
you know, the biggest strength

205
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:50,945
and the biggest weakness is
the same thing for you guys,

206
00:07:50,945 --> 00:07:54,387
which is, all of this is so
native and normal to you,

207
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:56,869
old guys like Victor and I, we realize

208
00:07:56,869 --> 00:08:00,627
how fucking crazy this opportunity is.

209
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:02,527
The fact that it doesn't cost anything

210
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:06,705
to get out there, just
time and having talent

211
00:08:06,705 --> 00:08:08,273
in a certain genre.

212
00:08:08,273 --> 00:08:09,879
So the biggest thing I can tell you is,

213
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:12,577
please don't underestimate
how special this time is.

214
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:14,190
The internet is now at scale,

215
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,585
but it's still early, and
eventually it's gonna get

216
00:08:16,585 --> 00:08:19,437
harder and harder and harder,
once everybody understands

217
00:08:19,437 --> 00:08:20,924
this truth.

218
00:08:20,924 --> 00:08:23,035
And so, what I'm doing is I'm going hard.

219
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,296
It's Instagram, it's
YouTube, it's Podcasting.

220
00:08:26,296 --> 00:08:27,539
I'm just going all-in,

221
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,519
because I realize this is a moment in time

222
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,892
in the same way that Google AdWords

223
00:08:30,892 --> 00:08:33,249
were a moment in time for
my dad's liquor store,

224
00:08:33,249 --> 00:08:34,240
and how I grew that business.

225
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,052
So, I would say my biggest thing is,

226
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:39,447
hey, please take advantage of this.

227
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:42,628
Like the days of building
a million followers

228
00:08:42,628 --> 00:08:45,896
on Instagram organic are going to go away,

229
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:47,301
and it's going to get harder.

230
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:49,410
And the fact that a lot of
this comes natural to you,

231
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,270
you know, obviously
you're taking this class,

232
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,300
you're thinking about your world,

233
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,484
but if you gotta passion
around a subject matter,

234
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:56,479
and you think you have something to say,

235
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:59,456
go hard, don't worry about
what other people think.

236
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:03,206
(music playing on cellphone)

237
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:08,246
That's how, a little patience.

238
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:14,586
- What'd I walk in to?

239
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:16,350
- Nothing, just, we were in town,

240
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,581
and we had the night, and
just emailed some people

241
00:09:19,581 --> 00:09:22,271
we are fond of, and here we are.

242
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,173
Those people couldn't make it, so.

243
00:09:24,173 --> 00:09:26,158
(laughing)

244
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:29,824
- [Male Off-Screen] Second string.

245
00:09:29,824 --> 00:09:33,241
- We panicked and just sent a bulk email,

246
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:35,826
you guys replied.

247
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:38,466
Like, I wouldn't even
call them comparable,

248
00:09:38,466 --> 00:09:41,893
so I just think it's the
way we take a lot of things

249
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:44,370
from Hollywood, and other
things of that nature.

250
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,683
But the advances, we've made.

251
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:49,033
- Are you saying the moon-landing
was Hollywood derived.

252
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:50,437
- No no no, not that.

253
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:53,116
Though it's amazing how
many people believe it.

254
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:56,744
I had this one guy tweeting me everyday.

255
00:09:56,744 --> 00:09:59,022
That half bottle of Maiden, Trouty,

256
00:09:59,022 --> 00:10:01,216
you sure you're willing to let that go?

257
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:02,832
Might wanna just pound it,

258
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:04,665
before we go to sleep.

259
00:10:16,346 --> 00:10:18,445
I threw up all over my face.

260
00:10:18,445 --> 00:10:19,945
Hey this is great.

261
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,049
(laughing)

262
00:10:30,304 --> 00:10:32,211
Alright, you two, you two, you two.

263
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:33,656
- [Male Off-Screen] Do
you guys know each other

264
00:10:33,656 --> 00:10:34,603
from previous lives?

265
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:35,969
- Ya.

266
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,165
- [Male Off-Screen] I mean,

267
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:37,998
all these guys know each other here?

268
00:10:37,998 --> 00:10:38,831
- Ya, they found each other.

269
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:41,301
- You'll have some fun with this, right?

270
00:10:41,301 --> 00:10:42,134
- Ya.

271
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:45,141
- John Deere, John Deere.

272
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:46,089
- I go John Deere?

273
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:47,043
- Fuckin' John Deere.

274
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:50,210
- 'Cause that's the, green, like Jeff.

275
00:10:58,835 --> 00:11:01,017
Guys, you don't understand.

276
00:11:01,017 --> 00:11:03,788
You'll love this, Clay,
my high school years,

277
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,695
my dad moved to a 28 acre farm

278
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:07,103
in Huntington County New Jersey, like,

279
00:11:07,103 --> 00:11:09,056
this is like the city
compared to where I grew up

280
00:11:09,056 --> 00:11:10,962
in my high school years.

281
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:11,795
- [Male Off-Screen] Really?

282
00:11:11,795 --> 00:11:13,115
- Ya, so, you know, Jersey's funny,

283
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:16,579
like there's pockets of
Jersey that are super rural.

284
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:19,226
I grew up in Iowa, not, even
though it was in Jersey.

285
00:11:19,226 --> 00:11:20,506
And even I live in Manhattan, like,

286
00:11:20,506 --> 00:11:22,779
this is normal shit for me.

287
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:24,779
Our cow was like my pet.

288
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:31,922
So like, I'm being dead-fuckin' serious.

289
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:34,938
We're a far way away from me selling it

290
00:11:34,938 --> 00:11:36,188
for 633 retail.

291
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:41,560
Clay why'd fuck me up.

292
00:11:47,361 --> 00:11:48,944
Ah-ha, there it is.

293
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:53,166
Well, I'm only as good as.

294
00:11:55,994 --> 00:11:57,494
I'm a Brooke 2013.

295
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,539
- That's his daughter.

296
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:01,862
- Me and Brooke, 2013.

297
00:12:01,862 --> 00:12:03,884
I swear to God, look.

298
00:12:03,884 --> 00:12:04,880
- Oh man.

299
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,750
- Ya, I'm in there.

300
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,667
- Not even.

301
00:12:11,986 --> 00:12:13,653
- Oh, over six foot.

302
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:17,595
What's that.

303
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:20,816
- [Male Off-Screen] We need to adjourn.

304
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:23,504
- Guys, you see that renovation,

305
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:24,659
you see that renovation?

306
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:26,437
That's going to be a boot room.

307
00:12:26,437 --> 00:12:27,883
You're gonna walk in there
and it's gonna be all boots.

308
00:12:27,883 --> 00:12:28,716
Really?

309
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:31,207
- He's already got one.

310
00:12:31,207 --> 00:12:32,208
I'm coming up Clay.

311
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,022
(laughing)

312
00:12:34,022 --> 00:12:35,474
Clay, I'm coming up.

313
00:12:35,474 --> 00:12:37,833
I wanna see the boot room.

314
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,444
Show me the boot room.

315
00:12:39,444 --> 00:12:42,667
- [Clay] This is the partial boot room.

316
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:45,187
These are work boots.

317
00:12:45,187 --> 00:12:46,589
- They really are, huh?

318
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:47,952
Why are they so expensive,

319
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:49,444
'cause this is like
crocodile or somethin'?

320
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:50,527
- Lucchese's.

321
00:12:52,842 --> 00:12:53,675
- For boots?

322
00:12:53,675 --> 00:12:55,796
- Ya, they're fuckin' nice too.

323
00:12:55,796 --> 00:12:57,035
- You like wearing boots?

324
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:58,848
- I think I seen these
things for like three bucks

325
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:01,683
at garage sales, it's incredible.

326
00:13:01,683 --> 00:13:04,291
- (laughing) These,
see these are all worn.

327
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,969
- You have any Jets' jerseys?

328
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:06,802
- Very good at it.

329
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:07,635
- Ya.

330
00:13:07,635 --> 00:13:09,498
- I don't know, I have
no fear, so you know,

331
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,204
how people, oh if I can make this.

332
00:13:11,204 --> 00:13:14,010
Fuck you, I'm pretty sure
I'm not going to make this,

333
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,002
drop here, I'm not gonna do this,

334
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,118
I'm not gonna make this placement,

335
00:13:17,118 --> 00:13:21,686
so if I have no fear,
everything else is a bonus.

336
00:13:21,686 --> 00:13:23,299
- I totally agree with you.

337
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:25,656
- And everybody goes in there
thinkin', I want I want,

338
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:28,218
I'm like, I don't really want this.

339
00:13:28,218 --> 00:13:29,582
I have a different way of farming,

340
00:13:29,582 --> 00:13:30,820
and a different way of thinking.

341
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,653
- Me too.

342
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:33,103
- I focus on the negatives.

343
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:33,936
- Me too.

344
00:13:33,936 --> 00:13:34,878
- And I fix the negatives.

345
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:35,711
- Me too.

346
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:36,990
- You wanna manage the positives?

347
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:37,823
- Me too.

348
00:13:37,823 --> 00:13:39,098
- No, I wanna fix the bottom line.

349
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:40,047
I wanna fix the issues.

350
00:13:40,047 --> 00:13:41,079
- Same fuckin' thing.

351
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:42,813
That's all I do, right?

352
00:13:42,813 --> 00:13:45,166
That's all I spend my time on.

353
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,994
Do you know I say I'm a firefighter?

354
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,267
When I go in to, when I write occupation,

355
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:51,086
when I come back in to America,

356
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:53,198
I put firefighter.

357
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:54,105
- I said that this morning.

358
00:13:54,105 --> 00:13:57,056
My daughter walks in, she
goes, I need five minutes

359
00:13:57,056 --> 00:13:58,088
of your time for you to
look at this newsletter.

360
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,156
I said, I'm puttin' out fuckin' fires,

361
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:01,932
it's what I do every fuckin' morning.

362
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:04,533
I don't worry about the good.

363
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:05,813
- Have no time to smell roses.

364
00:14:05,813 --> 00:14:06,646
- Fuck it.

365
00:14:09,134 --> 00:14:11,466
- I just didn't want her to bite anybody.

366
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:12,299
- She bites?

367
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:14,124
- Well, no, but I'm always worried

368
00:14:14,124 --> 00:14:16,193
'cause she's so fuckin' protective.

369
00:14:16,193 --> 00:14:17,802
- Oh, right, so I kiss on the cheek,

370
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:19,002
and she bites my face off.

371
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:22,026
- Nah, she hasn't but I'm
just, fuck, always worried.

372
00:14:22,026 --> 00:14:24,065
- Hey, I think it's
gonna be sunny tomorrow,

373
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:25,398
what's the data?

374
00:14:27,272 --> 00:14:30,422
It'd be a great SNL skit, Data Dan,

375
00:14:30,422 --> 00:14:33,020
no matter what you say,
he just plugs in data

376
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,838
on the spot, and if you don't have it.

377
00:14:35,838 --> 00:14:39,634
For the last 30 years, I think
the best thing we can do,

378
00:14:39,634 --> 00:14:41,371
I mean I think we're having
a tactical discussion

379
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:42,936
in the short term, and I'm thrilled,

380
00:14:42,936 --> 00:14:46,657
and I think I'm head-nodding
on a lot of this stuff.

381
00:14:46,657 --> 00:14:48,569
But I don't want to deviate from the thing

382
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:50,472
that I think is the most powerful,

383
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,756
and I'd love to get people's thoughts,

384
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:54,607
which is, we need to ammo and flood

385
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:59,278
15 to 25 year olds in the
channels that they consume

386
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,042
with messages like (silence),

387
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:06,260
some sort of rallying cry,
that gives them the ammo,

388
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,083
because they're the new energy,

389
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,056
and they, I absolutely believe,

390
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:13,696
the drunk driving, smoking thing

391
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:15,637
that was brought up 15 minutes ago,

392
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:17,410
was the most important insight,

393
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,062
because it wasn't the establishment

394
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:20,717
or the people that were in it,

395
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:24,889
it was the people underneath
that changed the movement.

396
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:29,471
Our greatest ammo is
persuading and informing,

397
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,905
but I think selling to the un-sellable

398
00:15:31,905 --> 00:15:35,245
is a wrong play, and I
think on both sides of this.

399
00:15:35,245 --> 00:15:37,227
We are too numb and normalized,

400
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:40,077
and I think this seed of 18 year olds

401
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:43,258
and 16 year olds being
pissed off and having ammo,

402
00:15:43,258 --> 00:15:45,251
just like them starting
the biggest companies

403
00:15:45,251 --> 00:15:48,265
in the world, is exactly
where we should go,

404
00:15:48,265 --> 00:15:50,410
with a punch of different messages,

405
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:53,390
and let them grab on to something, and go.

406
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,916
And I think that they could absolutely

407
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,312
affect the outcome.

408
00:15:57,312 --> 00:16:00,993
(classical guitar and keyboard)

409
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,528
- It's really rad.

410
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,528
Got a use for this vine.

411
00:16:10,257 --> 00:16:11,090
Bang.

412
00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:14,758
- [Male Off-Screen] All
like the ca-ryn-yons gone

413
00:16:14,758 --> 00:16:15,705
before people realize they like it,

414
00:16:15,705 --> 00:16:16,538
and start replanting it again.

415
00:16:16,538 --> 00:16:17,371
- [Gary] Same old thing.

416
00:16:17,371 --> 00:16:18,204
- [Male Off-Screen] Ya, always.

417
00:16:18,204 --> 00:16:22,204
(classical guitar and keyboard)

418
00:16:31,474 --> 00:00:00,000
(classical guitar with keyboard and beats)
