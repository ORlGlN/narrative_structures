i read an article about uber or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook</font>

198
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,300

00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:59,680
there's 70,000 a week that died and so I

201
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we're in a very</font>

202

205
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:10,340
will be and here's why because at the

206
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,069
same token there will be hundreds of

207
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:15,560
businesses built this year that will be

208
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,639
worth hundreds of millions of dollars

209
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,979
because this is the Second Industrial

210
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:21,740
Revolution there is a land grab every

211
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,479
business<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be disrupted so</font>

00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:24,860
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really difficult game I</font>

213
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,659

carnage and buy things<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a nipple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

217
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,078

what's happening there's real shit<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

219
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,219
built real opportunity so you're

220
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:38,269
navigating through a very difficult

221
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:42,440

222
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,720
times but it was a certain of times for

223
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,600
for you as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a non oriC absolutely for me</font>

entire business was<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wall Street and wine</font>

229
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,230
so like I navigated through that I

230
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,029
started vaynermedia right after the

231
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:03,620
financial crisis and I was selling

232
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,570

Chattanooga<font color="#CCCCCC"> first yes is that I think</font>

246
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,970
that agencies are broken in their

247
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,160
strategies because most of their clients

248
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,910
sell in an American market to America

249
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,209
right and and all their offices are in

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,250
you're a niche product that sells to the

257
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,290

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,410

benefit of doing a book tour<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font>

276
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,490
psychology of somebody who literally is

saving every dollar and every penny

278
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,130

four and a half roommates and they're

286
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,750
buying $11 cold coffee every day and I'm

game their minds in a different place

295
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,920

children and equality food and the

302
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,340

00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,790
have the empathy to deploy himself to

312
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,480
the 36 year old mom in Arkansas yeah you

313
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,770
know though it's actually by that's

314
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,150
interesting way you put it like to me

315
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,620
it's all kind of been the same which is

316
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,110
reverse engineer how to bring the most

317
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,000
disproportioned value to whoever's

318
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,620
paying attention to you around the

319
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,720
subject matter so it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thesis</font>

320
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,880
for wine library it was wines bro

321
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,340
in America nobody cares<font color="#E5E5E5"> about wine</font>

322
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,840
because everybody talks down to people

323
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,570
about wine I know a crapload about wine

324
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,940
I'm a Jersey boy I'm not gonna talk down

325
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,340
to anybody let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> start this and talk to</font>

326
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">people about wine and maybe we'll</font>

327
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,610
convert some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> young dudes that</font>

328
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,500
may now think wines cooler than just

329
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,940
drinking a beer<font color="#E5E5E5"> or liquor and that's</font>

330
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,440
basically what happened let me use

331
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube when it just was invented and</font>

332
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,390
let me do that that worked social crush

333
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,550
it when I wrote it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was hey there's a</font>

334
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,470
real way now with YouTube and Twitter

335
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,970
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook to build a business on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

336
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,980
terms I wrote that and now with

337
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,230
vaynermedia it's like hey big businesses

338
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,090
mid-sized businesses there's a real way

339
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,340
to not waste money on all the marketing

340
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,130
behavior so I'm and even<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we talked</font>

341
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,810
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you know back to our</font>

342
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,250
conversation before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> came here you</font>

343
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,960
said hey there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> London there's this I</font>

344
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,550
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's not talk about that let's</font>

345
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,440
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to bring them value if</font>

346
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,450
you default into bringing value to your

347
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,040
audience regardless of what your subject

348
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">matter is you will always win</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

349
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,700
you've won the leverage game of

350
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,620
providing value<font color="#E5E5E5"> first what is your</font>

351
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,540
strategy for creating content you've got

352
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,450
a sort of a virtuous<font color="#E5E5E5"> cycle of this right</font>

353
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,540
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> always producing we came up with a</font>

354
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,370
pretty good concept obviously a lot of

355
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,680
you watch the show<font color="#CCCCCC"> and node Iraq and</font>

356
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,390
India and they're part of a team that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

357
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,850
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a production team for my brand</font>

358
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,670
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we needed something to be a starting</font>

359
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,870
point in the reason I started the

360
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,330
askgaryvee show was I knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

361
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,830
the best way for me to start producing

362
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,440
content that wasn't naturally bubbling

363
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,450
up in my own<font color="#E5E5E5"> head when you get to ask</font>

364
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,370
the questions you're asking me different

365
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,530
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that aren't on my mind I put out</font>

366
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,720
the show that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a piece of content but</font>

367
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,660
then those five answers are starting

368
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,090
points to other content in India or

369
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,890
Steve will come to me and say hey that

370
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,600
second answer you haven't talked a lot

371
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,430
about parenting they'll ask me five or

372
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,020
six other questions that becomes the

373
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,330
framework of a medium post or LinkedIn

374
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,080
post or Facebook long-form posts so by

375
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,260
doing the show every day it's my seed to

376
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,360
create the level of content on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

377
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,160
listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's been interesting all my</font>

378
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,530
successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people that</font>

379
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,970
are paying<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention I've especially</font>

380
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">last 3-4 months so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many people coming up</font>

381
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,110
to me like man the level and the amount

382
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,910
of content<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're putting out just</font>

383
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,470
seems insane it's because there was a

384
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,120
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart strategy 15 months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

385
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,980
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> start a show that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forces me to</font>

386
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,930
consistent put out content let's then

387
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,510
use those seeds to grow out more pieces

388
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">of content and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've literally are you</font>

389
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,620
know d rocks filming now yes we may show

390
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,170
this in its entirety or I might have

391
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,670
just said something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that will turn</font>

392
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,620
into three different articles we're just

393
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,080
always on collecting and using those as

394
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">the gateway drugs to longer form content</font>

395
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,880
so daily is a model you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to force</font>

396
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,040
yourself to in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to keep creating</font>

397
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,850
I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very hard to create</font>

398
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,620
compelling content on a daily basis and

399
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,780
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that everybody here knows that</font>

400
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not easy and so I think Q&A is a</font>

401
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,520
very intriguing way to get there because

402
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,470
you're using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> incredible skills of</font>

403
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:27,280
others what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find is the is there</font>

404
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,410
a is a most valuable platform for you

405
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,780
right now comes the distributor<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook</font>

406
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,150
above ah yes facebook facebook is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

407
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">beast facebook is the foundation</font>

408
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,720
facebook is grossly underestimated by

409
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,089
the the most intense tech people because

410
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:42,550
they want to be on to the next thing but

411
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,290
the scale of<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook the ability to</font>

412
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,730
spend a little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money and target</font>

413

if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to target i'm getting a lot of</font>

419
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,290
of a test to see if I started running

420
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,060
this show against employees of

421
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,650
production companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I start</font>

422
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,810

446
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,970
self-awareness is something that needs

447
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,638
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start being talked about a little bit</font>

448
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:10,529

old entrepreneur to think i'm the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy</font>

460
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:37,590
news the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internets had it's saying like</font>

MTV they're so wrong snapchat to a 14 to

22 year old is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire cable industry</font>

465
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,480
I mean every 15 year old girl America if

466
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,590
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just curious about what they do</font>

467
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,330
they go home whenever they're done if

468
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,260
they have after-school activities

469
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,100
whatever but when I'm gonna get home

470
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,419
whether it's four or seven or whatever

471
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,159
the second they get home they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

472
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:00,840
room close the door they jump on their

473
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,370
bed they grab their phone and they stay

474
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,770
on snapchat until they go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sleep</font>

475
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">for hours and so people are grossly</font>

476
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,720
under estimating 125 million daily

477
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,360
active users that are spending hours on

478
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,400
the platform looks like and so there's a

479
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,960
gross underestimation of what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

480
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,340
happening there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes I'm desperately</font>

481
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,770
trying to impose my will into that

482
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,930
platform because I will have a

483
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,610
disproportionate lead as the

484
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,500
entrepreneur to that generation when

485
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,210
they start hitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the market five six</font>

486
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,530
years from now let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to question to</font>

487
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,300
the audience of my last<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh snap that is</font>

488
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,740
what's the whole story about how they

489
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,160
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this point to some older people</font>

490
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,560
it's as if<font color="#E5E5E5"> snapchat snuck right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up on us</font>

491
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">uh here's a memo that's I'm really glad</font>

492
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,470
you asked this question everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

493
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,820
you're about to watch for next 30 years

494
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,350
with humans is pendulum swings social

495
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">media everybody tell everybody about</font>

496
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,590
everything right momentum went this way

497
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,910
happened for a couple years all the

498
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,560
momentum all the conversation everybody

499
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,420
bet on it every app tried to do it and

500
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,220
then all of a sudden snapchat came along

501
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,040
and said no wait a minute in real<font color="#CCCCCC"> life</font>

502
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,510
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk those things disappear</font>

503
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,030
privacy has value let's push the other

504
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,430
way and so they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> their white space</font>

505
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">I actually am already starting to figure</font>

506
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,590
out what's the swing back to open in a

507
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,610
post snapchat world five years from now

508
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:25,870
on that note because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience</font>

509
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,260
sorry occur yes a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

510
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,450
inspirational amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> 18 hour days you</font>

511
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,890
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you fight you</font>

512
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,050
looking well thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so how do you</font>

513
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,760
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for health and wellness in</font>

514
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,070
action well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't doing health and</font>

515
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,170
wellness as a you know June of last year

516
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,900
and finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about it</font>

517
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,850
for a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I finally figured out</font>

518
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,050
what was happening which is I believe

519
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,520
with health and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wellness and probably</font>

520
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,050
most probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything you're either</font>

521
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,270
accountable to yourself or you're not

522
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,120
bless you and so in every other part of

523
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">my life I'm accountable I feel</font>

524
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,180
accountable especially with my

525
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,000
businesses like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rigor the the sense</font>

526
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,590
of responsibility I have for the other

527
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,290
550 employees is greater than my own

528
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,060
well-being and when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said that notice</font>

529
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,740
even how I said the sentence I just said

530
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,570
I'm accountable myself but I explained

531
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,130
it as I was accountable to other people

532
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,320
and I what I just did with you by

533
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,750
accident is how I figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> this out</font>

534
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,250
was like what's the matter with me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

535
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,590
gonna die like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna lose like the</font>

536
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,910
last like or I'm not gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do</font>

537
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,320
as many cool things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not</font>

538
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,150
gonna work this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is black and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> white</font>

539
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,680
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna treat my body like a business</font>

540
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,810
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> audited I'm gonna lose I've lost</font>

541
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,230
and so then i said why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that I'm so</font>

542
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,600
good at every things and I realize holy

543
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,140
crap the things I'm best at our when I'm

544
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,290
accountable to somebody but not myself

545
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,150
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I realized i'm going to introduce a</font>

546
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,520
person<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm gonna hire a full-time health</font>

547
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,130
person and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm more accountable to Mike</font>

548
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,500
than I am to myself the reason I work

549
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,300
out every single day is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to</font>

550
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,520
let Mike down I have to be down at 5 45

551
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,410
because Mike's gonna be upset and so i

552
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,140
hacked myself and so where do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I find</font>

553
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,030
health I just I found it like I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

554
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">it every day there's an hour</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every day</font>

555
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,770
scheduled like period<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of story I</font>

556
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,600
work out every day of my life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

557
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,610
changed my eating behavior because of it

558
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,020
because fuck if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna do the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

559
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,410
you know and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how I hacked it</font>

560
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,270
i reverse-engineered what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was doing I</font>

561
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,920
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think everybody here is either</font>

562
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,660
accountable to themselves or accountable

563
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,850
to others and you need to self audit

564
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,470
yourself and figure out if you're not

565
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,610
doing well in business maybe you need to

566
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,930
hire a couple of employees because maybe

567
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,220
you'll feel a sense of responsibility to

568
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,260
them maybe that's the motivation you're

569
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for vegas marwari you will work</font>

570

571
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,010
a mic isn't going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fly and usually</font>

572
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes she travels with me the whole nine</font>

573
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,220
but there's a quick in and out right but

574
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I will have to face time with him while</font>

575
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,220
I do cardio because I truly if I don't

576
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,920
won't do it as well nice touch next

577
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,650
question let's go here so we're all here

578
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very huge influence our to us who</font>

579
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:57,010
influenced you my parents and that's it

580
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,170
and I know it's like I get mad at this

581
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,760
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's either</font>

582
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,580
cliche or maybe I always ask myself am I

583
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,440
too egotistical to give it to somebody

584
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,020
else it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the truth like I don't</font>

585
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,820
look at Elon Musk or sucks or Cuban or

586
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,640
the President or III I don't do that

587
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,920
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not real it's just not true I</font>

588
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,890
look at my parents I know their truths I

589
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,360
know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> came this country with nothing</font>

590
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,670
you know I know I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> my dad</font>

591
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,530
worked every minute I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know him</font>

592
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,200
till I was 14 I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> my mom is the</font>

593
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,300
foundation of my self-esteem which is

594
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,260
the driving fuel of my success I'm

595
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,890
there's just there's not even a close

596
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,900
second to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> parents and I</font>

597
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,940
don't know these other people another

598
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,470
public persona in the same way that a

599
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,640
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know me as I'm affect</font>

600
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,800
the thing I probably happiest about in

601
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world is the people that come into</font>

602
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,610
vaynermedia that have some sense of me I

603
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,860
think like me a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more two or three</font>

604
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,090
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> later when they get to look under</font>

605
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,090
the hood um but I'm too scared maybe to

606
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,830
even give that away to somebody else

607
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,300
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

608
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">time to look under the hood there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

609
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,470
hand right next to the visa so I'm a j1

610
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,690
middle-aged guy like you yes I deal with

611
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,240
