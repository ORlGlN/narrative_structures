00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,270
nasir asks sometimes my passion is seen

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,790
as aggression how do I walk the line do

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">I change to someone more passive this</font>

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,690
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monsieur first of all don't change</font>

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:19,470
for anybody now finding that balance of

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,080
grace and having that tack to be

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,680
consumable is a process I somewhere

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,910
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> eighth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grade into sophomore year</font>

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,500
didn't hit the right tone anymore I was

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,890
too intense for my classmates and I

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,149
literally I could taste it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

12
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,530
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> empathy in kind of self-awareness</font>

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,590
and it's an ongoing process like you

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,570
know for example mighty notes are

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,129
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just referenced them I'm</font>

16
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:45,930
actually evolving that cadence

17
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,789
throughout the conversation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tone</font>

18
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,379
because I'm reacting to the body

19
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,690
language of everybody else it's not

20
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how do you become more passive</font>

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,199
because I'd hate that suck the passion

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,719
out of you which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a huge variable to</font>

23
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,420
success controlling it and people saying

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,430
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a little too much I have a</font>

25
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,369
feeling<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's predicated on you</font>

26
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,350
caring too much for it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be valuable</font>

27
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,020
for you and let us say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that again for</font>

28
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody the only reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

29
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,509
I'm able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off this is because</font>

30
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,270
there's a healthy balance of caring

31
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">about you when you care more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about your</font>

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,220
audience than what you have to say you

33
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,770
start winning right when you when you

34
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,960
care more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about your global audience</font>

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,170
listening or watching and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

36
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,490
the 15 minutes and what am I going to

37
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of it and sure in a right hook</font>

38
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,420
world it's always there let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me let me</font>

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,829
actually use this question to find

40
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:41,970
something that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think I talked</font>

41
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,579
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the book</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I live in a world of</font>

42
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,979
Jab Jab Jab right hook let me tell you

43
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,960
two interesting things of that I don't

44
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,610
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel that I ever have to</font>

45
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,320
throw a right hook and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> expect</font>

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,640
the need to throw a right hook based on

47
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,860
my jabs in micro levels at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the holistic</font>

48
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,799
level I do also there's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

49
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,090
that we never<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about is there</font>

50
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,070
which is what happens when the right

51
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,409
hook doesn't land I'm actually not

52
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:06,270
disappointed what happens when I do all

53
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">awesome stuff for these guys or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font>

54
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,730
else I don't have any expectation that

55
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,629
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something awesome</font>

56
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,850
for me and

57
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,110
eliminating that lack of expectation

58
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,270
opens up a world of where you can

59
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,790
provide so based on your question based

60
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,680
on my intuition my vibe on this question

61
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,350
it has a whole lot to do with you caring

62
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,260
more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

63
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,400
judging you that are telling you to

64
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">chill out there telling you that because</font>

65
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,170
not about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your passion because take it</font>

66
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and many other people people</font>

67
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,450
