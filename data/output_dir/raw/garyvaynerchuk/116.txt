00:00:00,122 --> 00:00:01,652
- Hey guys, here at Wine Library,

2
00:00:01,652 --> 00:00:03,817
just filming some wine
videos for the store.

3
00:00:03,817 --> 00:00:05,777
But real quick, before
you go into today's vlog,

4
00:00:05,777 --> 00:00:08,749
it is time to subscribe to my channel.

5
00:00:08,749 --> 00:00:10,458
So many of you are not doing it.

6
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:13,509
Let me pull my, let me just
roll up for a solid right hook.

7
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:14,456
This is the opportunity.

8
00:00:14,456 --> 00:00:16,574
Please, please, please subscribe.

9
00:00:16,574 --> 00:00:18,074
Not sure exactly the UI.

10
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:19,380
It would mean the world to me.

11
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,817
Hope you enjoy today's vlog.

12
00:00:20,817 --> 00:00:23,650
(energetic music)

13
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,766
(soft music)

14
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:53,779
- I need to run.

15
00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:54,779
- Please, Gary.

16
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:57,384
- It was great to see you.
- Always great to see you.

17
00:00:57,384 --> 00:00:58,747
- [Man] Hey, Gary.

18
00:00:58,747 --> 00:01:00,313
Archie got you something
for your birthday.

19
00:01:00,313 --> 00:01:02,656
- Thank you, Cesar!

20
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:04,775
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

21
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:05,609
I'm kidding!

22
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:06,609
I'm kidding.

23
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:08,612
- It's a t-shirt.

24
00:01:08,612 --> 00:01:10,439
- I love it, man.
- Nothing fancy, but.

25
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,380
- Scooby-Doo.

26
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,213
Dude.

27
00:01:12,213 --> 00:01:13,290
Nice job.

28
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,607
This is a very meaningful gift

29
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,115
because it's a very, very, very,

30
00:01:17,115 --> 00:01:19,362
you have to be hardcore
fan, you have to know

31
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:21,132
a lot about me to know this.

32
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:23,899
My favorite cartoon is the Laugh Olympics

33
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:25,822
which is a cartoon that
like nobody knows existed.

34
00:01:25,822 --> 00:01:28,290
First of all, it was a '70s cartoon.

35
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,436
I only saw it because
they replayed it on USA

36
00:01:31,436 --> 00:01:34,727
and one of the, it's groups of cartoons

37
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,786
competing against each
other and one of the teams

38
00:01:36,786 --> 00:01:40,478
was called the Scooby-Doobies
and this is what that is.

39
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:41,311
I love this.

40
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:42,144
Thank you, man.

41
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,050
I'm gonna definitely rock this.

42
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,883
Hey, vlog.

43
00:01:43,883 --> 00:01:47,388
Going to a new partnership
meeting opportunity for PureWow

44
00:01:47,388 --> 00:01:49,147
and Iris is breaking things.

45
00:01:49,147 --> 00:01:49,980
We'll see you later.

46
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,397
(soft music)

47
00:01:56,923 --> 00:01:59,252
What I think is when I
care about something,

48
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,462
I think I know how to hack culture

49
00:02:02,462 --> 00:02:06,206
to make something relevant
that people actually start--

50
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:10,033
Has the disproportionate
ROI in my opinion for--

51
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:12,123
Where I feel passionate
about it from a standpoint

52
00:02:12,123 --> 00:02:15,525
is actual business and I
think this is the engine

53
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:19,539
and the framework to
create a world where--

54
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,372
You know me.

55
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:22,842
I'm a disrupter that's practical.

56
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,842
I know for fact that I--

57
00:02:25,985 --> 00:02:26,966
I just know that for fact.

58
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:28,882
Just had a crazy call with a client.

59
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,132
Big time stuff.

60
00:02:31,197 --> 00:02:34,145
Iris, you'll figure out how
to beep 98 percent of it.

61
00:02:34,145 --> 00:02:35,567
Use some things that meant nothing

62
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:37,840
but giving you guys context,
just trying to close

63
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,429
a multimillion dollar deal.

64
00:02:40,429 --> 00:02:42,808
We don't show this part of me
but show from the beginning,

65
00:02:42,808 --> 00:02:44,301
timestamp it, would you?

66
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:45,384
- [Iris] Okay.

67
00:02:45,384 --> 00:02:47,262
- I'll give you guys the preview.

68
00:02:47,262 --> 00:02:49,145
Actually, may not even need the timestamp.

69
00:02:49,145 --> 00:02:51,209
It was a 30 minute call exactly.

70
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:52,632
These are things I want to show more of.

71
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:53,892
I just spent 30 minutes trying to tell

72
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:55,337
one of the biggest brains in the world

73
00:02:55,337 --> 00:02:58,328
to do a sponsorship thing in
the gallery, the PureWow world.

74
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:00,607
It would be millions
of dollars in revenue.

75
00:03:00,607 --> 00:03:04,434
This is what I do when you don't see me.

76
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,999
You don't build 150
million dollar businesses--

77
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:09,566
- Yeah, work it.
- Selling sneakers.

78
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:11,370
So, building businesses.

79
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,787
(soft music)

80
00:03:17,557 --> 00:03:19,747
Your card meant a lot to me.

81
00:03:19,747 --> 00:03:20,580
- [Iris] Of course.

82
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,890
- I'm so happy the way it all worked out.

83
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,935
What a missed opportunity
it would have been

84
00:03:25,935 --> 00:03:28,135
for both of us if you'd left.

85
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:30,635
I'm so glad you came to that realization.

86
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:33,822
You're such a special girl,
we're gonna do so well together.

87
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:35,030
I'm gonna help you so much.

88
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,657
It's like the best decision you ever made.

89
00:03:36,657 --> 00:03:37,490
- [Iris] Yeah.

90
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,513
It really came from the heart.

91
00:03:38,513 --> 00:03:42,680
Before I came here, you really
really helped me a lot, so.

92
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,461
Before I came here, when I was back home.

93
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:48,294
- Yep.

94
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,624
- My mom and everything.
- Yep.

95
00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:51,951
- [Iris] During that time,
it was really difficult

96
00:03:51,951 --> 00:03:54,855
but I would, seriously,
I would watch your stuff

97
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:58,208
and listen to everything,
like wow, it was really hard.

98
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,041
- Yeah.

99
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,741
- [Iris] But for some
reason, my listening to you,

100
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,597
it really, really helped
me get through it.

101
00:04:02,597 --> 00:04:03,526
- I know.

102
00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:05,076
Listen, anybody who picks up--

103
00:04:05,076 --> 00:04:05,909
- [Iris] And that's one of the reasons

104
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:07,458
why I really believe in you.

105
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,291
(Gary laughs)

106
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,124
Because, you know--

107
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:09,957
- You lived it.

108
00:04:09,957 --> 00:04:10,790
- [Iris] Yeah, and so--

109
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,687
- But then to be able
to come in the inside--

110
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:13,520
- [Iris] I know.

111
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,591
- And actually see how real it is,

112
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:15,943
to know it's even more real.

113
00:04:15,943 --> 00:04:17,103
- [Iris] Yeah.

114
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:17,935
Yeah.

115
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:20,110
And how deep it is.

116
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:22,828
That's why I feel such a
passion here and for you,

117
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:26,152
it's 'cause I get to do
that, like help you--

118
00:04:26,152 --> 00:04:28,128
- Reach more, I know what you're,

119
00:04:28,128 --> 00:04:30,067
of course I know why you're excited.

120
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:31,251
- [Iris] Yeah, so.

121
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:32,697
Thank you, Gary.

122
00:04:32,697 --> 00:04:35,114
(soft music)

123
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:43,488
- Vlog.

124
00:04:43,488 --> 00:04:45,665
Iris and I just had a very
important conversation

125
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:48,567
and I'm gonna force her to share it.

126
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:49,400
(she laughs)

127
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,233
Sorry, Iris.

128
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:52,078
So, here it is.

129
00:04:52,078 --> 00:04:54,493
We just did it ten minutes
ago or she just played it

130
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:56,433
and now I'm doing this part,
it's funny and I'll continue,

131
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:58,204
which was what I'm gonna say next,

132
00:04:58,204 --> 00:05:00,012
356, rolling into Wine Library.

133
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:03,701
Once a year I take VaynerMedia New York

134
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:05,633
to Wine Library since it's close

135
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:08,101
and people do their holiday
Thanksgiving shopping.

136
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:09,204
It's a fun day.

137
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:12,790
It's kinda meshing my
two worlds so 90 or so,

138
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,833
almost 100 of the employees
are either here now,

139
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:15,666
are they here yet?

140
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:16,499
Do you know?

141
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:17,469
- Oh, yeah!
- They're here?

142
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:18,474
Oh, they came a while ago?

143
00:05:18,474 --> 00:05:19,307
- [Iris] Yeah.

144
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:20,948
- Oh, awesome.

145
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:22,481
Anyway, nonetheless, bunch
of Wine Library people

146
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:23,774
here right now.

147
00:05:23,774 --> 00:05:27,659
VaynerMedia people are here
right now at Wine Library.

148
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:28,687
Here are some of the highlights.

149
00:05:28,687 --> 00:05:31,104
(soft music)

150
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:36,475
Here we have the man,
the myth, the legend,

151
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,397
guys this is Sasha Vaynerchuk.

152
00:05:41,397 --> 00:05:43,980
He's the owner, founder, proprietor, CEO,

153
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,615
chairman of the board of Wine Library.

154
00:05:46,615 --> 00:05:47,590
- Nice sneakers.

155
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,423
- [Iris] Thank you!

156
00:05:48,423 --> 00:05:49,256
I love 'em.

157
00:05:49,256 --> 00:05:50,089
- Yeah.
- Where are yours?

158
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:51,858
(Iris laughs)
(smooching)

159
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:53,856
What do you have to say to all
the young entrepreneurs, Dad?

160
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:56,428
What's a good piece of advice from you,

161
00:05:56,428 --> 00:05:58,493
all the years of wisdom, being
a successful entrepreneur,

162
00:05:58,493 --> 00:06:00,504
truly coming from nothing and building,

163
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:02,014
what's a good piece of advice?

164
00:06:02,014 --> 00:06:02,847
- Good piece of advice?

165
00:06:02,847 --> 00:06:03,680
- Yeah.

166
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,847
- Work hard and just keep
investing in what you believe

167
00:06:14,768 --> 00:06:18,851
and have a lot of respect
for your fellow workers

168
00:06:21,104 --> 00:06:22,779
who work with you because that's what

169
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:25,151
makes you more successful.

170
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,651
- But why were you successful?

171
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:29,949
- I had nothing to lose.

172
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:31,387
(he laughs)

173
00:06:31,387 --> 00:06:33,171
Let's start with that, really.

174
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:34,053
I had nothing to lose--

175
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:35,055
- Fine.

176
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:36,062
What about tenacity?

177
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,749
Do you think you just
willed it to success?

178
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:41,916
- No, I was determined to make it big.

179
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:47,866
- Tenacity.

180
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:48,699
- Not as big as you are.

181
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,425
- Well, I mean, nobody's gonna
end up being able to say that

182
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:53,590
when I'm done with this.

183
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,821
- (laughing) I know.

184
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:56,238
- [Iris] Awesome.

185
00:06:58,492 --> 00:06:59,577
- [Gary] 'Sup, gang?

186
00:06:59,577 --> 00:07:00,410
(chorus of "hi"s)

187
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,243
- Hey, hey!

188
00:07:01,243 --> 00:07:02,290
Hey, hi!

189
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,872
Hey, how are you guys?

190
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:04,858
Hi!

191
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,171
You guys havin' fun?
- Yeah.

192
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:07,749
- This is my dad, Sasha.

193
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:08,582
- Hello.

194
00:07:08,582 --> 00:07:09,415
- Hi.
- Hi.

195
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:10,748
- How are you?

196
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:11,581
Pleasure.

197
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:12,414
'Sup man?

198
00:07:12,414 --> 00:07:13,247
How you doin'?

199
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:15,357
Chaser, how are you, brother?
- Everybody's of age?

200
00:07:15,357 --> 00:07:16,190
- Yes.

201
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,023
- You sure?

202
00:07:17,023 --> 00:07:19,828
(he laughs)

203
00:07:19,828 --> 00:07:20,885
Hello!

204
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:21,718
- [Man] Hello.

205
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:23,409
I'll be right there.

206
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,242
(hands clapping)

207
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:25,218
(patting backs)

208
00:07:25,218 --> 00:07:26,502
- You're doing a great job, brother.

209
00:07:26,502 --> 00:07:27,335
- Thanks so much.

210
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:28,168
- I'm so proud of you.

211
00:07:28,168 --> 00:07:29,001
- Thank you so much.

212
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:32,279
- Literally, for the
first person of my thesis

213
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:35,041
to be working out this
well, it's a big deal.

214
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,933
Because if it didn't work, and you quit

215
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:38,944
or he was like suck it
or I was like fuck this,

216
00:07:38,944 --> 00:07:40,202
it would be different.

217
00:07:40,202 --> 00:07:42,056
It's so important for
the first one to work.

218
00:07:42,056 --> 00:07:43,974
(energetic music playing in background)

219
00:07:43,974 --> 00:07:45,719
I'm gonna hire six more of
you in like six minutes.

220
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:46,552
(laughing)

221
00:07:46,552 --> 00:07:47,575
That's the plan.

222
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:50,415
Seriously, I mean, look, I
think you're a special dude

223
00:07:50,415 --> 00:07:53,416
but I think I get six
emails like that a year

224
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,711
and I'm gonna try.

225
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:56,235
People that are smart.

226
00:07:56,235 --> 00:07:58,244
For you to be this smart
to take one step backwards

227
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,817
for 54 steps forward,
that's just fucking smart.

228
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:02,147
And it's so obvious, right?

229
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:04,163
It's obvious to you 'cause
that's why you're doing it

230
00:08:04,163 --> 00:08:05,902
but it's obvious to me.

231
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,324
Do you know that Iris quit?

232
00:08:07,324 --> 00:08:08,157
- [Sinan] Yeah--

233
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:09,610
- And then re, unquit?
- We talked about it.

234
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,443
(laughing)

235
00:08:10,443 --> 00:08:11,276
- That's amazing.

236
00:08:11,276 --> 00:08:12,651
But that's what it is, what?

237
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:13,484
Iris!

238
00:08:13,484 --> 00:08:14,340
She quit.
- Oh.

239
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,173
- [Iris] Hey, Ray.

240
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:17,797
- And then she was like, but
then she was like, mm-mm.

241
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,318
- [Woman Over Speaker] Grant call 208.

242
00:08:19,318 --> 00:08:20,151
Grant 208.

243
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:21,437
- Check eBay, let's see what's going on.

244
00:08:21,437 --> 00:08:22,494
You gotta see this.

245
00:08:22,494 --> 00:08:26,127
'Kay now go to, scroll down, completed.

246
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:26,960
- [Man] I remember.

247
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,117
- [Gary] And sold, okay.

248
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:30,975
Look what's going on there.

249
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,959
Okay, this is today.

250
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:32,792
This is today.

251
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:34,441
- I mean--
- 200 bucks.

252
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:36,024
This is 85 dollars.

253
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,260
200, 169, 210--

254
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:40,461
- Look, by now.

255
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:42,211
- Yeah.
- Right, like.

256
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:44,699
That's 13.

257
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:45,800
- This is just ridiculous.

258
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,689
- I should have bought more.

259
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:48,052
- Brandon, you made a huge mistake.

260
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:48,885
- I did.

261
00:08:48,885 --> 00:08:51,106
- This is the best eBay
arbitrage we've ever seen

262
00:08:51,106 --> 00:08:54,289
and it's my sneaker and we did it.

263
00:08:54,289 --> 00:08:55,811
Type in, get rid of sold.

264
00:08:55,811 --> 00:08:57,459
- You should put on this white--

265
00:08:57,459 --> 00:08:59,401
- Type solder.

266
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:00,935
- How surreal is this.

267
00:09:00,935 --> 00:09:05,102
Just, this literally looks
like some upper deck promotion.

268
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:07,562
Alright.

269
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:10,118
Brandon, give me
something to taste out of.

270
00:09:10,118 --> 00:09:11,536
(bottle sliding)

271
00:09:11,536 --> 00:09:13,953
(soft music)

272
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:19,024
My dad's default face is
my favorite thing on Earth.

273
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:20,064
- What is it?
- Who's it for?

274
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:21,555
(Iris laughing)

275
00:09:21,555 --> 00:09:23,593
- Hey Wine Library email
list, this is Gary Vaynerchuk,

276
00:09:23,593 --> 00:09:25,816
former host of Wine Library TV

277
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:28,660
that I used to film in
this office on this table

278
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,827
and today's mega offer is the
Conn Valley 2015 Chardonnay.

279
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:36,974
Kyle's here?

280
00:09:37,821 --> 00:09:38,654
What the hell is--

281
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:39,487
- [Iris] Elle and Anthony are here.

282
00:09:39,487 --> 00:09:40,320
- And Lev?

283
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,153
What the hell are they doing here?

284
00:09:41,153 --> 00:09:42,980
- [Iris] They brought boxes for the wine.

285
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,485
- [Man] For your wine club.

286
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,163
- That's awesome.

287
00:09:47,163 --> 00:09:47,996
Alright.

288
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:52,564
I love how integrated
Vayner and Wine Library are.

289
00:09:52,564 --> 00:09:54,403
- [Man] Gary, this is my grandma.

290
00:09:54,403 --> 00:09:55,236
- Hello, Grandma!

291
00:09:55,236 --> 00:09:56,069
- Grandma Z.

292
00:09:56,069 --> 00:09:57,044
- Hi Grandma Z!

293
00:09:57,044 --> 00:09:57,877
- [Grandma] Hi there.

294
00:09:57,877 --> 00:09:58,710
- How are you?

295
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,543
- [Grandma] How are you?

296
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:00,376
- Good.

297
00:10:00,376 --> 00:10:01,209
Happy holidays.

298
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:02,860
- [Grandma] Good, thank
you and to you too.

299
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,693
- Thank you.

300
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:06,633
- [Grandma] I hope you all
get some rest out there.

301
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:07,493
- We'll figure it out.

302
00:10:07,493 --> 00:10:08,347
(laughing)

303
00:10:08,347 --> 00:10:09,643
One day.

304
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:10,476
- Yeah.
- Have a great day.

305
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:11,309
Take care.

306
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:13,726
(soft music)

307
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,794
I mean, it's been an incredible ride

308
00:10:18,794 --> 00:10:20,975
for the pedestal that the entrepreneur

309
00:10:20,975 --> 00:10:25,156
has been given in culture,
in the modern culture

310
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:29,156
and I think what's cool
for me is I really think

311
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,757
I'm a real, pure-bred
entrepreneur, at the ultimate core.

312
00:10:36,757 --> 00:10:39,741
There's, I've got the steak and the sizzle

313
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:41,384
and I think that's what
makes a great entrepreneur

314
00:10:41,384 --> 00:10:43,625
and I just think it's really cool.

315
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:47,630
I'm so humbled to be
able to represent a thing

316
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,797
and a type of man and woman
and I take that responsibility,

317
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,235
a new, emerging feeling for
me is how good I have to be

318
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:01,249
because I've been given the opportunity

319
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:05,452
to be an entrepreneur that
a lot of people look at

320
00:11:05,452 --> 00:11:08,836
and I think I am, a lot of
people are impressionable

321
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,427
when it comes to entrepreneurship.

322
00:11:10,427 --> 00:11:12,172
And I think there's an enormous
amount of responsibility

323
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:16,296
I have to do it the right way
and so all these decisions,

324
00:11:16,296 --> 00:11:18,279
all these marketing concepts,
things like the sneaker,

325
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:22,762
I take them very seriously,
never looking at the short term

326
00:11:22,762 --> 00:11:23,595
and this was a good one.

327
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:25,306
I'm very happy about it.

328
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:29,051
I just, I have more humility than people

329
00:11:29,051 --> 00:11:31,484
that should have it, you know?

330
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:32,619
It's just my gear, man.

331
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:35,036
Look, again, it's fun to do this with you

332
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:38,119
because you worked at and closely to,

333
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:40,075
obviously we're on separate offices,

334
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,815
but you know, you have a very
clear feeling of what I am.

335
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:43,755
I'm not fancy, man.

336
00:11:43,755 --> 00:11:46,284
I listen, I think I'm great
in all those good things

337
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:48,803
but I also think I'm shit and who am I

338
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:51,081
to not engage with everybody on Twitter

339
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:53,681
at 1:30 in the morning if
the website's not working.

340
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:56,577
I want to, I respect and am humbled

341
00:11:56,577 --> 00:11:58,691
by their attention and
admiration and interest

342
00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:00,722
in buying something, and I'm
there to help and apologize

343
00:12:00,722 --> 00:12:02,775
and I'm willing to do customer service

344
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:04,803
and I'm willing to be the CEO.

345
00:12:04,803 --> 00:12:06,521
I'm willing to make 500
million dollar deals

346
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:09,688
and I'm willing to carry cases to the,

347
00:12:10,717 --> 00:12:13,290
I mean I grabbed a shopping
cart today for somebody.

348
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,687
Like, it'll never go,
I came from zero, man.

349
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:18,437
I came from not a whole lot, man.

350
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,136
I was a 14 year-old stock
boy, you know what I mean?

351
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:24,491
Like I had to work my
summers, I've got work in me.

352
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:26,624
I'm not scared of work, I'm not fancy.

353
00:12:26,624 --> 00:12:28,394
There is never graduating.

354
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:30,809
There is no graduating to the next level.

355
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:32,557
You release a sneaker,
the website's not working,

356
00:12:32,557 --> 00:12:34,798
you go on Twitter and fucking
answer people's headaches.

357
00:12:34,798 --> 00:12:35,631
The end.

358
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,016
I don't know if there's
anybody getting more

359
00:12:39,016 --> 00:12:40,846
out of what they've got than me,

360
00:12:40,846 --> 00:12:43,513
and it comes out of my humility.

361
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:46,246
Got it?

362
00:12:46,246 --> 00:12:48,932
And so you won't get as
much as you've been gifted

363
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:52,465
with charisma and talent
and all that you have,

364
00:12:52,465 --> 00:12:56,728
because you think you're
special before you are.

365
00:12:56,728 --> 00:12:58,145
Alright, brother.

366
00:12:59,026 --> 00:12:59,859
Take care.

367
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:01,000
Talk to you, buh bye.

368
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,001
Vlog, if Iris decides to use this,

369
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:04,470

371
00:13:06,972 --> 00:13:08,226

Rootin' for him.

373
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:10,761
Hope he wins.

374
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:12,045

375
00:13:12,045 --> 00:13:13,079

376
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:13,912

Heading into mid-November.

Shoe is launched and sold out.

384
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,832
Crazy what's going on on the Bay.

385
00:13:44,832 --> 00:13:46,752
Anyway, that's done.

Good to see my pops.

Sure that's gonna be good content.

391
00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:58,260
And now going to the Knicks
game with my brother AJ.

00:14:28,664 --> 00:14:29,759
But it's not like Jekyll and Hyde,

407

00:14:34,731 --> 00:14:36,276
