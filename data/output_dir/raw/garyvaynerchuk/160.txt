1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,666
- Yeah, I just finished a
Harvard Business case study,

2
00:00:02,666 --> 00:00:03,625
which is gonna be exciting,

3
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:06,379
and now I'm walking into the 4Ds.

4
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:08,908
I'm not wearing any
shoes, 'cuz fucking Tyler

5
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:11,270
told me I had sneakers, and then I didn't.

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,103
Hey

7
00:00:12,103 --> 00:00:13,590
- (group responds)
- Hello!

8
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,672
Hello, hello, hello!

9
00:00:14,672 --> 00:00:16,435
♫ Still dreaming like this
world ain't against me

10
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:17,888
♫ Like my skin tone different

11
00:00:17,888 --> 00:00:18,968
♫ Like Pops was always around,

12
00:00:18,968 --> 00:00:20,055
♫ Like wasn't nothing missing

13
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:22,322
♫ I ain't tripping, I know
some people had it worse

14
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:25,066
♫ But just 'cuz it's common,
that don't lessen my curse

15
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,315
♫ And for my dawg behind
the wheel as we speak

16
00:00:27,315 --> 00:00:28,349
♫ With bread set aside,

17
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,458
♫ But you be working like you can't eat

18
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,341
♫ Keep dreaming, dawg, keep dreaming

19
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:34,839
♫ I know some days you wanna
go from planning to scheming

20
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:37,089
♫ Ya, yeah

21
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:41,651
- Going to speak to the peeps right now.

22
00:00:41,651 --> 00:00:43,731
I just had a cool job interview.

23
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:44,564
Forget about everything else,

24
00:00:44,564 --> 00:00:45,950
do you know why we're gonna win?

25
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,494
Because I don't care
about making any money.

26
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:50,639
(elevator dings)

27
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:52,748
- (Man) Poor April, that one guy.

28
00:00:52,748 --> 00:00:53,607
- This is a no-brainer.

29
00:00:53,607 --> 00:00:55,223
You know, I forgot about this model,

30
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:57,429
'cuz this was stuff I learned
about, like years ago.

31
00:00:57,429 --> 00:00:58,814
Dude, you're, this is good.

32
00:00:58,814 --> 00:00:59,882
I'm fucking pumped.

33
00:00:59,882 --> 00:01:01,933
Do it fucking every
day, in your underpants

34
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:03,330
in your fucking living room.

35
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,973
Have more people own the
fucking data, have the data.

36
00:01:06,973 --> 00:01:09,269
They become your leads, not
some fucking random numbers

37
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,448
that called in to some ...

38
00:01:10,448 --> 00:01:13,034
Like, it's crazy better.

39
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:15,039
I have to exploit this, this is insane.

40
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,077
That was nuts.

41
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:17,427
- (Man) That was nuts.

42
00:01:17,427 --> 00:01:20,130
- 4Ds has, like, been
such an incredible ...

43
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,066
I wish I could, you know, sometimes in my,

44
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:24,303
like, darkest moments of Vayner,

45
00:01:24,303 --> 00:01:26,963
I'm like, I'm gonna sell
Vayner and just do 4Ds,

46
00:01:26,963 --> 00:01:29,904
just, like, spend 18 hours
a day with businesses,

47
00:01:29,904 --> 00:01:30,924
and just fucking jam.

48
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,757
It'd be so, so f ...

49
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:32,590
I mean, I love it.

50
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,423
Yeah, man.

51
00:01:33,423 --> 00:01:34,536
I love how, I love,

52
00:01:34,536 --> 00:01:35,388
you know what I like?

53
00:01:35,388 --> 00:01:38,388
I like the historical impact, right?

54
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:40,700
Because I'm always
looking for those trends.

55
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,962
I think, such a young
group, every one of us

56
00:01:42,962 --> 00:01:45,252
will see two sports that don't even exist,

57
00:01:45,252 --> 00:01:47,839
or, are, like, in some
weird sub-culture right now

58
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:49,826
that are gonna be mainstream, right?

59
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:51,441
I mean, when you think
about where eSports,

60
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:53,731
soccer, and UFC is today,

61
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:54,893
compared to where they were

62
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:58,060
when I was 21 years old, 20 years ago?

63
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:02,177
Either non-existent, couldn't
even think about it existent,

64
00:02:02,177 --> 00:02:05,381
or it's never gonna happen here, right?

65
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:07,918
UFC was banned, soccer will
never happen in America,

66
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:12,010
and eSports fundamentally did not exist.

67
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:12,853
I'll talk to you later.

68
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:13,761
- (Man) Gary!
- Yes.

69
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:14,594
- (Woman) I'll send you an email.

70
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:15,562
- What's that?

71
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:17,043
Of course!

72
00:02:17,043 --> 00:02:18,267
Adrian, you want to get in?
- (Adrian) Yes

73
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:19,100
- Awesome
- Thanks, man!

74
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,524
- Such a pleasure, nice
meeting you, what's your name?

75
00:02:20,524 --> 00:02:21,414
- (Sanjay) Sanjay
- Sanjay?

76
00:02:21,414 --> 00:02:22,247
- (Sanjay) Pleasure, let's meet up.

77
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:24,169
- Yes, love it, see ya!

78
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:25,209
Really good, great talk.

79
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:26,042
I felt really good about that.

80
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:26,875
- (Man) Yeah, man.

81
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:27,708
- You know, obviously I love,

82
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,010
as you guys know on
YouTube, I love sports.

83
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,084
Fun to come, sorry,
D-Rock, let me get here.

84
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:34,359
Fun to come to the NBA,

85
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:37,997
great, great business executives,
sports, like Fan Dual.

86
00:02:37,997 --> 00:02:40,458
You know, just great
setting, a lot of fun.

87
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,988
I got going, there,
there's some good stuff.

88
00:02:41,988 --> 00:02:44,094
♫ What the hell, what
the hell, what the hell

89
00:02:44,094 --> 00:02:46,355
♫ Ooh, what happened to
ambition in some older place

90
00:02:46,355 --> 00:02:48,807
♫ And education for a
graduation not a stay

91
00:02:48,807 --> 00:02:51,147
♫ Stop the blaming, you were
lame and you should be ashamed

92
00:02:51,147 --> 00:02:52,608
♫ Well, you played the
game that ain't for fame

93
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:54,456
♫ So I'll put you back where you came

94
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:56,748
♫ It's Omid, that's my first namesake name

95
00:02:56,748 --> 00:03:00,915
♫ So move over, I am coming
for my place in the mainframe

96
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,322
- D Rock, turn around.

97
00:03:03,322 --> 00:03:06,357
YouTube, a little learning moment,

98
00:03:06,357 --> 00:03:08,071
talking to Tyler about some strategy.

99
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:11,519
I say something about experience,
D-Rock starts laughing,

100
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,115
and it's just funny to watch both of them.

101
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:16,505
It's unbelievable what seems hard today

102
00:03:16,505 --> 00:03:18,928
becomes so easy when you actually do it.

103
00:03:18,928 --> 00:03:20,961
It's unbelievable, it's
like working out, actually.

104
00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:22,791
It's like, 80 pushups?

105
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,374
Reps, fucking reps.

106
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,749
- (Tyler) Fucking reps.

107
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:27,582
- Like, just watching you

108
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,507
be able to handle way more, easier.

109
00:03:30,507 --> 00:03:32,776
And, you know, you, too.

110
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:35,995
It's just probably how
I got here, right, like,

111
00:03:35,995 --> 00:03:39,412
20 fucking years of reps, you know, reps.

112
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:45,642
20 years of fucking the
responsibility on my neck.

113
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,975
It's how I eat shit all day.

114
00:03:49,231 --> 00:03:53,266
Better start eating shit,
it's how you get paid.

115
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,653
Okay.

116
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:55,486
So-
- (D Rock) So-

117
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:56,721
- (Justin) Welcome to the
block, you're the fucking man,

118
00:03:56,721 --> 00:03:57,554
and a local hero.

119
00:03:57,554 --> 00:03:58,506
- Thank you, Justin.

120
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:00,157
Real pleasure, man,
thanks for setting us up.

121
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,530
- My dad, from The Wine Library-

122
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,363
- (Gary) Yes

123
00:04:02,363 --> 00:04:03,552
- Also thinks you're the fucking man.

124
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:04,385
- Thank you, Brother.

125
00:04:04,385 --> 00:04:05,306
Tell him I said, what's up.
- (Justin) Good job, man.

126
00:04:05,306 --> 00:04:06,353
- Thank you, man.

127
00:04:06,353 --> 00:04:09,017
(audience laughs)

128
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:09,850
Oops.

129
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,289
My man, you did a great
job, that was a lot of fun.

130
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:12,376
- Appreciate it-
- Thank you.

131
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:13,209
- Appreciate it, yeah.
- I appreciate your work.

132
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:14,042
- (Man) You're gonna
be hyped for this one.

133
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:14,875
- Yeah, I think this'll be a good one.

134
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:15,708
When do you guys air it?

135
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,755
What up, YouTube?

136
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:17,588
Say hello.

137
00:04:17,588 --> 00:04:18,700
- Hey, what's going, YouTube?

138
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,757
GaryV-
- Tell them, tell 'em.

139
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:20,590
How'd it go?

140
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:21,423
- He killed it.

141
00:04:21,423 --> 00:04:23,118
- How many guests have
you had on this show?

142
00:04:23,118 --> 00:04:24,641
- Uh, like a hundred.

143
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:27,045
- And am I the best
guest of all time, now?

144
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:27,954
I mean, is it pretty obvious?

145
00:04:27,954 --> 00:04:29,885
- In a-
- What do you think?

146
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:31,196
- Stratosphere all your own, here.

147
00:04:31,196 --> 00:04:32,262
- Like, seriously, on a very serious note,

148
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:33,095
what do you think?

149
00:04:33,095 --> 00:04:34,292
Like, rank me all-time on this show.

150
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:35,259
- Top three.

151
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:36,254
- Who are the other two?

152
00:04:36,254 --> 00:04:39,114
- Uh, TJ Miller, I really liked.

153
00:04:39,114 --> 00:04:40,333
- Okay, and?

154
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,347
- I don't know, there's always-

155
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:42,999
- Top two, top two, fuck you, TJ!

156
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:46,311
(audience laughs)

157
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:47,611
Thanks, man, take care.
- Alright, bye, Dude.

158
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:48,444
Yeah, you, too, man.

159
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:49,553
- See ya.

160
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:51,610
Oh, sorry, Hawaiian
shirt, what's your name?

161
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,443
- Bill.
- Bill.

162
00:04:52,443 --> 00:04:53,647
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you, man.

163
00:04:53,647 --> 00:04:54,696
What's up, Sis?

164
00:04:54,696 --> 00:04:56,096
The Sis is in the house!

165
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,087
- (Woman) What department are you in?

166
00:04:57,087 --> 00:04:58,447
- I'm in Ad Ops.

167
00:04:58,447 --> 00:04:59,280
- (Woman) Oh, that's right.

168
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,205
- She's just hiding, she's not doing shit.

169
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:02,636
She, like, hides in the
corner, makes pretend,

170
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,522
just gets paid.

171
00:05:03,522 --> 00:05:05,079
That was good, what do you think, D Rock?

172
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:05,960
All right, let's go.

173
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,832
I know it's a nice family reunion,

174
00:05:06,832 --> 00:05:08,371
but let's get the fuck out of here.

175
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:10,248
You can see I'm getting better
with the vloggy stuff, right?

176
00:05:10,248 --> 00:05:12,063
That's why you've been
down on the last two,

177
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,945
because I've been so busy

178
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:13,986
I haven't been able to do anything.

179
00:05:13,986 --> 00:05:15,815
Two, see it?

180
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,628
Some people see "network," I see "two."

181
00:05:19,628 --> 00:05:23,007
This is why I win: I see
different things than people see.

182
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:25,784
Seriously, it's a real insight.

183
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,356
- (D Rock) I see "joy," not "enjoy."

184
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:31,718
- D Rock, don't rip off my, ah, this guy.

185
00:05:31,718 --> 00:05:32,829
I see, I see a rat!

186
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:34,912
(laughs)

187
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,189
Can you get me '94 Madden?

188
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:39,106
Who's this?

189
00:05:40,497 --> 00:05:42,607
Nobody's supposed to be
calling me right now, right?

190
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:43,931
- Uh, yes.
- Who?

191
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:46,248
- It's a podcast, Brams, sport network.

192
00:05:46,248 --> 00:05:48,748
- Yo, this is Gary Vaynerchuk.

193
00:05:53,632 --> 00:05:54,873
How are you?

194
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:58,623
This feels like a pretty
safe place to do it.

195
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:02,869
I've been very disappointed
by media companies

196
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:04,340
who were always trying to figure out

197
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,695
what am I going to do for
you when I put out this show,

198
00:06:06,695 --> 00:06:09,292
or this article, or this radio show,

199
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:11,666
and then when it came to
social, to your point,

200
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,287
follow me, follow me,
follow me, follow me.

201
00:06:14,287 --> 00:06:16,509
I get why, it was the
first time we put numbers

202
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,201
as a public domain, it's a badge, right?

203
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:19,454
How many followers you got?

204
00:06:19,454 --> 00:06:22,210
How many, I get why it happened.

205
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,776
It's why I'm so glad it happened,

206
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:25,882
because I was able to see through that,

207
00:06:25,882 --> 00:06:28,784
and I was hacking the game
that actually mattered,

208
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:31,020
which was depth, not width.

209
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,165
I mean, it's even this,
what the hell am I doing

210
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:34,571
on your show right now?

211
00:06:34,571 --> 00:06:35,869
Like, everybody in my world is like,

212
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:38,054
this is not a good
allocation of your time.

213
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:39,720
We've got businesses to run,

214
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,936
you've got bigger shows that are,

215
00:06:40,936 --> 00:06:43,648
you know, I'm saying no to
CNBS and ESPN every day,

216
00:06:43,648 --> 00:06:44,942
and I'm here with you right now,

217
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:46,937
because I like serendipity,

218
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:49,457
I like building depth with
people on the come up.

219
00:06:49,457 --> 00:06:50,816
I like that you're going to be able

220
00:06:50,816 --> 00:06:54,096
to use my name to book
bigger guests in the future.

221
00:06:54,096 --> 00:06:57,179
I like Karma, I think it's practical.

222
00:06:59,317 --> 00:07:00,790
I think audio's gonna explode,

223
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,701
so I think podcasts are
gonna explode even more so.

224
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:05,251
Alexa's skills, I think Amazon

225
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:07,092
is going to become a major player.

226
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:09,502
I think Amazon is the one
that could probably create,

227
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:12,402
if I heard today Amazon A has launched,

228
00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:14,775
and it's a new social network called A,

229
00:07:14,775 --> 00:07:16,709
I would be, like, hey, this has a shot,

230
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:20,474
just 'cuz I believe in the people, right?

231
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:23,255
So, I think there'll be one or two things

232
00:07:23,255 --> 00:07:25,668
five years form now that everybody is on.

233
00:07:25,668 --> 00:07:27,244
And definitely in the youth.

234
00:07:27,244 --> 00:07:29,461
I think that somebody who's
eight years old right now

235
00:07:29,461 --> 00:07:31,363
in five years, will be on an app every day

236
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,030
that does not exist.

237
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:36,619
I never eat lunch or
breakfast, and here's why.

238
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:37,452
- You're tired.

239
00:07:37,452 --> 00:07:40,184
- I'm, like, tired, I'm
like fuck this food.

240
00:07:40,184 --> 00:07:42,131
Like, no wonder all of
you don't work that much;

241
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:43,298
you eat lunch.

242
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,752
What's up?

243
00:07:46,752 --> 00:07:47,585
- Doing well?

244
00:07:47,585 --> 00:07:48,418
- Doing well.

245
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:51,480
City bikes, they're bikes, D Rock.

246
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,801
I'm just gonna run around New York City,

247
00:07:52,801 --> 00:07:54,060
"Guys, we have an alert!

248
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,643
"Found some real pinot grigio!"

249
00:07:57,926 --> 00:08:00,052
She loved it, she loved it.

250
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:02,179
Guys, we did it, we
found real pinot grigio!

251
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:03,916
Anybody looking for
some real pinot grigio?

252
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:08,765
Hey, you looking for that
real pinot grigio? (laughs)

253
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:09,820
- (Man) Gary, what's up, bro?

254
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,966
- (Gary) Hey, brother, how are ya?

255
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:12,254
- Everything good?

256
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:13,087
- Everything's good, you?

257
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:14,095
- Good to see you, keep it up, man.

258
00:08:14,095 --> 00:08:16,333
- From yelling about pinot
grigio in the streets of New York

259
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,578
to going to one of the largest,

260
00:08:18,578 --> 00:08:20,747
most conservative companies in the world.

261
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:22,876
♫ Get back, it's so
bad, I'm about to hijack

262
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:25,566
♫ Yo, for jack, don't be
mad, you a tad late to be-

263
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:27,146
- I certainly can't walk, and think,

264
00:08:27,146 --> 00:08:29,122
and talk, and sign
something at the same time.

265
00:08:29,122 --> 00:08:30,088
- (Woman) And smile.

266
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:30,921
- And smile.

267
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:32,751
- (Woman 2) And smile, and now.

268
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:34,129
- How come you have two mics?

269
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:35,594
- Because I do a daily vlog.

270
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:36,511
- Oh, okay.

271
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,038
- I am double-mic'd often.

272
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,701
- (Tyler) Very often.

273
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:45,008
- D Rock, get in here, let
me get a photo with you.

274
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:45,841
Good to see ya.

275
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:46,674
- I'm a huge fan.
- Thank you, brother.

276
00:08:46,674 --> 00:08:47,765
- It's so cool to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

277
00:08:47,765 --> 00:08:48,773
- Dude, I watched all your videos,

278
00:08:48,773 --> 00:08:49,606
and it really inspired me.

279
00:08:49,606 --> 00:08:50,439
- Thank you, brother.

280
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:51,272
- We're gonna get started

281
00:08:51,272 --> 00:08:52,174
- Might as well, right?

282
00:08:52,174 --> 00:08:53,412
- You winked at me, and everything.

283
00:08:53,412 --> 00:08:55,019
I feel like we're old friends.
- I know, right?

284
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:55,955
- So far, so good.

285
00:08:55,955 --> 00:08:57,126
- So far, good start.

286
00:08:57,126 --> 00:08:58,480
Awesome, man, thanks for coming.

287
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,679
I'm about to go do this talk

288
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,763
for Cornell Tech, and Bloomberg.

289
00:09:01,763 --> 00:09:05,543
Super excited, great vibes, good crowd.

290
00:09:05,543 --> 00:09:07,759
Old friends, life is good.
- Old friends.

291
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:11,302
(audience claps)

292
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:12,390
- Thanks for having me.

293
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,336
(audience laughs)

294
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:14,906
- Have you thought about
monetizing your voice?

295
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:16,025
That's incredible.

296
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:18,204
- (Man) If you can give
me two power moves,

297
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:20,036
to consumer attention, because you have

298
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:23,357
basically mastered the art of video.

299
00:09:23,357 --> 00:09:25,915
Everybody and their mother watches you.

300
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:28,029
So, if you give me two power moves

301
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:31,012
that you can use in the next 24 hours

302
00:09:31,012 --> 00:09:35,179
to getting consumer
attention, what would they be?

303
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,870
- I would become
disproportionally educated,

304
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,696
or start practicing very aggressively

305
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:46,584
in understanding how Facebook ads work.

306
00:09:46,584 --> 00:09:49,017
Facebook ads are so good.

307
00:09:49,017 --> 00:09:52,250
You can create long-tail clusters,

308
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,436
42-year-old Latino women that
like the New York Jets, okay?

309
00:09:56,436 --> 00:09:58,186
Now, go make a video.

310
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:02,695
Go make a Spanglish video about the Jets,

311
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:06,862
like, the ability for the
micro target at scale, right?

312
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:11,185
Like, I have a video that went berserko,

313
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:13,019
which was, it was
basically, I was getting mad

314
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:16,724
that no 44-year-old thought
themselves as an entre ...

315
00:10:16,724 --> 00:10:18,868
Like, I was watching all
the 19 and 20 year-olds

316
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,066
with all these
opportunities, and I'm like,

317
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:22,366
Jesus, where are all the
40, 50, 60 year-olds?

318
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:24,105
Have you heard, you're going to be living

319
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:25,120
longer than you think.

320
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,838
Like, let's go get ours, right?

321
00:10:26,838 --> 00:10:29,282
So I made that video, and it went crazy,

322
00:10:29,282 --> 00:10:31,973
because I targeted 40 to 60 year-olds

323
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:33,671
that watch Shark Tank.

324
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:34,521
(audience laughs)

325
00:10:34,521 --> 00:10:37,094
There's so much capability in that.

326
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:40,772
I'd also, you know, look,
I've got gift for gab,

327
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:42,364
you've got crazy voice.

328
00:10:42,364 --> 00:10:44,915
Like, you've gotta be smart about that.

329
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:47,179
The first three seconds really matter,

330
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:50,517
the copy really matters, the
thumbnail really matters.

331
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:51,563
Everything matters.

332
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:52,785
I love how people think these people

333
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,326
who have amassed millions of followers

334
00:10:54,326 --> 00:10:57,076
because they got lucky, you know?

335
00:10:58,436 --> 00:11:01,657
There's so much thought
that goes into what we do.

336
00:11:01,657 --> 00:11:04,664
A lot of testing and
learning, but Facebook video.

337
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,283
YouTube is hard to break out, very,

338
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:08,848
Facebook video, less hard,

339
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:10,524
especially if you have a
couple hundred bucks per video

340
00:11:10,524 --> 00:11:12,063
to try to get it to go.

341
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:14,273
(camera clicks)

342
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:17,751
Heading to see Ben Leventhal, CEO of Resy.

343
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:20,093
His babysitter just canceled, so,

344
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:23,211
instead of the restaurant,
we're going to his apartment.

345
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:25,653
So, great day, super enjoyed today.

346
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:27,469
Lot of good content for you, D Rock.

347
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:29,363
Big day for D Rock.

348
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:32,106
And YouTube, big love,
love all of you guys.

349
00:11:32,106 --> 00:11:33,754
Keep grinding, keep hustling.

350
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:35,953
You know all the cliche
shit, but most of all,

351
00:11:35,953 --> 00:11:37,582
figure yourself out.

352
00:11:37,582 --> 00:11:39,495
♫ Yeah, my focus, eyes closed

353
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:40,775
♫ This has set the tone

354
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:42,895
♫ No limit that used the
sky is the stepping stone

355
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:45,003
♫ Lately I've been
thinking more speaking less

356
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:48,271
♫ My lungs empty, but I still
feel less stress I'm blessed

357
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:51,529
I don't give a fuck if fucking
Randy, the Macho Man, Savage

358
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:55,136
came from the death, went on my sock,

359
00:11:55,136 --> 00:11:57,672
and then came back to
life and did two channels.

360
00:11:57,672 --> 00:11:58,733
As my favorite person of all time,

361
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:00,161
rest in peace, Randy Savage

362
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:01,078
- (Man) Yeah.

363
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:02,065
- I wouldn't give a fuck.

364
00:12:02,065 --> 00:12:04,532
Please, never, I mean
that was such a ridiculous

365
00:12:04,532 --> 00:12:05,827
thing to say to me.

366
00:12:05,827 --> 00:12:07,937
You know me so well, what the
fuck's the matter with you?

367
00:12:07,937 --> 00:12:10,593
I'm not even gonna do anything, I'm done.

368
00:12:10,593 --> 00:12:12,008
I'm not even gonna expand on it.

369
00:12:12,008 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just disappointed in you.
