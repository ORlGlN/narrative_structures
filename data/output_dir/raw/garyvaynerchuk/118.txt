1
00:00:00,523 --> 00:00:01,709
- Hey, guys.

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,100
I hope you're having a great
weekend or the start to one.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,551
Curiosity 180 created
this video on YouTube.

4
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:08,533
One of the things I want
to do is start using

5
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:09,937
my YouTube channel a little bit more

6
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:11,840
to put on people that
are doing creative work

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,007
around content that is involving of me

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,846
and this was an incredible
effort you're about to see.

9
00:00:17,846 --> 00:00:19,551
Tremendous work.

10
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:22,167
Based on how many followers
they have and views,

11
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:24,638
they're getting their
hustle, getting going,

12
00:00:24,638 --> 00:00:26,616
and so hopefully a bunch
of you can reach out

13
00:00:26,616 --> 00:00:28,744
and do stuff with each other

14
00:00:28,744 --> 00:00:31,564
and so it's a little bit
of that old Biz Dev Sunday

15
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:36,482
kind of thing where just a
lot of fun to put somebody on

16
00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:37,880
who made something amazing.

17
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,145
Guys, gals, I love the video.

18
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:41,191
It's super rad.

19
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:42,583
Here it is.

20
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:45,166
(upbeat music)

21
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:53,746
- [Narrator] Gary,
Gary, Viner, Vinerchuck?

22
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:54,616
Vay-- What?

23
00:00:54,616 --> 00:00:56,571
(static)

24
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:58,262
Vaynerchuck, okay.

25
00:00:58,262 --> 00:01:00,845
(upbeat music)

26
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,666
Gary Vaynerchuck is undoubtedly the symbol

27
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:09,275
for hustle, execution,
and digital advertising.

28
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:11,626
He is the CEO and
co-founder of Vayner Media,

29
00:01:11,626 --> 00:01:13,654
and an early investor of great ideas,

30
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:16,625
such as Tumblr, SnapChat, and Twitter.

31
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:19,364
He is a four-time New York
Times best-selling author

32
00:01:19,364 --> 00:01:21,714
and inspires millions
with his YouTube show,

33
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:23,031
The Daily Vee.

34
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:25,860
To find out how he
achieved his grand status,

35
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,062
we have to dive into the origin
story of a young Gary Vee.

36
00:01:30,062 --> 00:01:32,421
Gary was born in the former Soviet Union,

37
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:34,425
and witnessed his older
relatives being imprisoned

38
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:37,416
and ostracized for being Jewish.

39
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,435
In hopes for a better
life, Gary and his parents

40
00:01:39,435 --> 00:01:42,165
immigrated to the United States.

41
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:44,308
With very little money,
Gary's dad made ends meet

42
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:47,052
by working as a stock
boy in a liquor store.

43
00:01:47,052 --> 00:01:50,590
Gary experienced difficulty
adapting to the American culture

44
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,329
and was notorious for
being a terrible student.

45
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:55,333
Even though education wasn't his calling,

46
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:59,366
he quickly found he had a
different special ability.

47
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:02,170
Gary was keen on observing human behavior.

48
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,425
He had an intuitive
feeling on what factors

49
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:07,610
motivated people to buy, sell, and trade.

50
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,461
His introduction to
entrepreneurship started

51
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:11,564
when he was only six years old.

52
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,299
He would run to his neighbor's property,

53
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,485
pull flowers out of their garden,

54
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:17,574
ring their front doorbell,
and then sell it back to them.

55
00:02:17,574 --> 00:02:20,338
He also had eight lemonade
stands around New Jersey

56
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:22,219
and had his friends working for him

57
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:24,143
at each of the locations.

58
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:27,264
His major breakthrough
came when he turned 13

59
00:02:27,264 --> 00:02:29,304
and started selling baseball cards,

60
00:02:29,304 --> 00:02:31,088
making thousands of dollars every weekend

61
00:02:31,088 --> 00:02:32,606
with the developing understanding

62
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:35,143
of the concept of supply and demand.

63
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:37,004
By the time Gary was a young adult,

64
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:40,143
his dad saved up enough money
to buy his own liquor store.

65
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:42,233
He made Gary quit all his other ventures

66
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:45,162
to work for him for minimum wage.

67
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:47,248
Gary worked every day
and observed how his dad

68
00:02:47,248 --> 00:02:49,418
interacted with his customers.

69
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:52,363
He quickly realized his expertise
in selling baseball cards

70
00:02:52,363 --> 00:02:54,507
can transfer to selling wine.

71
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:58,674
He soon became an oenophile,
or a lover and expert of wines.

72
00:02:59,877 --> 00:03:02,785
When Gary was in college, he
was introduced to the internet,

73
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:06,316
which was then known as the
information superhighway.

74
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:09,038
Gary saw this as an opportunity
to increase wine sales,

75
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:12,213
and thus, winelibrary.com was born.

76
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:14,478
Armed with a vast amount
of emotional intelligence

77
00:03:14,478 --> 00:03:16,451
and experience with
early internet projects

78
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:20,275
like winelibrary.com and Wine Library TV,

79
00:03:20,275 --> 00:03:23,703
Gary decided to create his
own digital marketing agency.

80
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,080
Gary is now the CEO of Vayner Media,

81
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,220
an agency that is filled
with digital ninjas

82
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,335
who excel in story telling,
branding, and marketing.

83
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:34,870
However, despite all of his success,

84
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,841
Gary takes the time to
produce motivational content

85
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:41,252
for anyone who needs push
in the right direction.

86
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:43,926
If you haven't yet, we
highly encourage you

87
00:03:43,926 --> 00:03:45,803
to check out his channel
where you can find

88
00:03:45,803 --> 00:03:47,986
some inspiration for your journey,

89
00:03:47,986 --> 00:03:50,410
and hopefully, you too can mold yourself

90
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,695
into a legendary entrepreneur.

91
00:03:53,695 --> 00:03:55,787
This video focused on Gary Vaynerchuck,

92
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:57,740
in hopes that his hustle and hard work

93
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,615
motivates and inspires our viewers

94
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,165
to go after what they want and to focus

95
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:03,024
on being happy.

96
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:05,465
Today, November 14th, is also his birthday

97
00:04:05,465 --> 00:04:07,089
and the launch of his sneakers,

98
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:10,412
Gary V 001 and 001 by K-Swiss.

99
00:04:10,412 --> 00:04:13,320
Congratulations, and great hustle.

100
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,737
(soft music)

101
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:20,394
- Hey, guys.

102
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:21,241
Hope you enjoyed it.

103
00:04:21,242 --> 00:04:23,000
Lot of fun, pretty good, right?

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,299
So this weekend, the Jets have a buy,

105
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:26,715
so nothing on Sunday.

106
00:04:26,715 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you like to do
on your team's buy week?
