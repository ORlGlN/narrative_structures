00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,203
- [Charlie] I really 
actually believe

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:06,740
your take on the 
business of music.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,842
The B2C and B2B--

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:09,863
- Correct.

("Legendary" by Welshly Arms)

6
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:33,526
- What if I told you this was

7
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:35,914
the last Monday 
morning of your life?

8
00:00:41,134 --> 00:00:45,064
("Riot" by Jon Waltz)

9
00:01:02,923 --> 00:01:04,917
- [Gary] Hey Dad, just calling 
you to tell you I love you.

10
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:08,155
Hope you're having a 
good day, hit me back.

11
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:18,442
Yeah. Yep.

12
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:30,084
Morning guys, 
going up to North Jersey.

13
00:01:30,084 --> 00:01:31,719
Heading to see a client.

14
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:35,889
It's been a hectic week ending
days at like 12, one o'clock.

15
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:38,182
Glad this week's over.

16
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:39,450
Get a little rest this weekend.

17
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,319
My nephew Max's 
seventh birthday, laser tag.

18
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,387
Should be fun.

19
00:01:43,387 --> 00:01:46,290
About to go on Instagram Live

20
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,594
to promote this "50 Seconds 
To Every 50 Year Old."

21
00:01:50,594 --> 00:01:53,931
I am on a mission for 
every 50 year old in the world

22
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:56,166
to see this, so if you 
got a 50 year old aunt,

23
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,669
uncle, brother, sister, child.

24
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:01,185
Please, please send it on.

25
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:02,252
Link it up here Babin.

26
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:03,787
Give me a little edit here.

27
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:04,855
Like give me something.

28
00:02:04,855 --> 00:02:05,723
A little clip of it.

29
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:07,024
I mean crap, you could 
play the whole damn thing.

30
00:02:07,024 --> 00:02:08,726
It's only 50 seconds.

31
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:11,161
I need you to 
understand something.

32
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:12,996
You have so much time.

33
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,371
I am flabbergasted 
by how many people

34
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,624
think that at 50 it's over.

35
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:21,758
Avi, how old are you?

36
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:23,385
- [Avi] 44.
- 44.

37
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:27,681
Like, remember how old you
thought 44 was, 20 years ago.

38
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:28,582
- [Avi] (laughs) Yes.

39
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,117
- Like finished, right?

40
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:30,951
- [Avi] Correct.

41
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,986
- And doesn't it feel crazy
how young you feel right now?

42
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,348
- [Avi] I feel energized.
- Yeah, I feel like.

43
00:02:34,348 --> 00:02:35,922
Well especially 
now with this new job.

44
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,991
The energy's just 
bolting in your fuckin' face.

45
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,960
24/7.

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,512
There's a fuckload 
of 50-year-olds

47
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:42,973
that think their life is over.

48
00:02:42,973 --> 00:02:44,041
That think it's over.

49
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,176
'Cause they've been playing
for 30 years professionally,

50
00:02:46,176 --> 00:02:47,077
they're tired.

51
00:02:47,077 --> 00:02:49,112
They've been an accountant
for 30 years, they hate it.

52
00:02:49,112 --> 00:02:50,380
But they don't see any way out.

53
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,249
Because they don't realize
that there's Instagram Live.

54
00:02:52,249 --> 00:02:54,218
'Cause they don't realize
that there's Facebook groups.

55
00:02:54,218 --> 00:02:55,886
'Cause they don't 
realize that they can do a blog.

56
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:57,621
'Cause they don't 
realize they're a great writer.

57
00:02:57,621 --> 00:03:00,324
And if they did 14 Medium 
posts, they can blow up.

58
00:03:00,324 --> 00:03:03,293
And so I'm on a mission 
to get them to understand

59
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:05,596
that there's still 30, 
40 years of amazing things.

60
00:03:05,596 --> 00:03:06,964
Modern health,

61
00:03:06,964 --> 00:03:09,900
these people are gonna be
healthy for another 30 years.

62
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,068
30.

63
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:13,303
You know how much shit you
can get done in 30 years Avi?

64
00:03:13,303 --> 00:03:15,873
You were 14, 30 years ago Av?

65
00:03:15,873 --> 00:03:16,707
- [Avi] That's correct.

66
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:18,074
- How old are you?
- [Other Tyler] 23.

67
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:19,914
- You were fuckin' 
negative seven, mother fucker.

68
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:20,801
(group laughter)

69
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:24,604
This motherfucker 
was negative seven.

70
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,207
I just, I want this one.

71
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,421
You know?

72
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,044
How old are your parents?

73
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,102
- [Other Tyler] 45.
- So, what the fuck?

74
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:34,614
Did you send it 
to your parents yet?

75
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:35,449
- [Other Tyler] I will.

76
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,617
- No, give me the camera. 
Let's do it right now.

77
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,386
Bam, you like that Avi?

78
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,321
That's the gangster 
shit I do, you did it?

79
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,679
- [Other Tyler] Mom's got it.
- [Gary] Mom's got it.

80
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:44,631
Can't wait 'til she sees it.

81
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:45,726
India, I love you back.

82
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,527
You think mom's gonna be 
mad at you that you said,

83
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:51,264
hey mom watch this, but it's
for 50 year olds and she's 45?

84
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,599
- [Other Tyler] Yeah, you
might've gotten me in trouble.

85
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,667
- Yeah
(laughing)

86
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:54,998
- I love it.

87
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,113
You know this 50 
for 50 video I made?

88
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,547
- [Woman] Yeah.
- Five seconds ago.

89
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:08,648
- [Woman] Yeah.

90
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:13,120
- The head of (censored) wants 
me to give a keynote now.

91
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,509
How fucking cool is that?

92
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:17,611
Av, it's amazing how 
like that works, right?

93
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:48,488
How are you?

94
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,191
- That meeting, on 
the 31st that we had?

95
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,025
- Which one?

96
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,997
- James, Alex, Sophie.

97
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:55,815
Linda, Dan.

98
00:04:56,657 --> 00:04:59,773
Content and theory would stem
from the direction we get out

99
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:00,967
of this meeting.

100
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,426
- Okay, all good, 
all good stuff.

101
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:04,838
- [Woman 2] Okay. Cool.

102
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,067
(camera shutter clicking)

103
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,879
- Right then and there.

104
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,159
That they were completely lost
in the reality of the world.

105
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,129
I think the funniest part of
that statement is actually,

106
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:22,132
take the word music out 
and put in any other word

107
00:05:22,132 --> 00:05:23,867
and it's the same thing.

108
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:27,270
People are just 
completely not quantifying

109
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,940
the communication 
shifts of our society.

110
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,508
Can I give you a 
great piece of advice?

111
00:05:31,508 --> 00:05:33,610
Are you off the label now?

112
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:37,414
Put out as much 
music as possible,

113
00:05:37,414 --> 00:05:39,783
as often as possible.

114
00:05:39,783 --> 00:05:42,185
And mix it between 
covers and original.

115
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:43,353
The end.

116
00:05:43,353 --> 00:05:45,022
And if you're good 
enough, you will win.

117
00:05:45,022 --> 00:05:46,923
Andy, how many 
video interns do you want?

118
00:05:46,923 --> 00:05:49,059
What do you say video, like.
- [Andy] 500.

119
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:52,362
No seriously, but 
like chopping like editing?

120
00:05:52,362 --> 00:05:55,565
- [Andy] Chopping, editing, 
formatting for Facebook.

121
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:56,967
- Okay. Interns?

122
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:57,934
- [Andy] Interns.

123
00:05:57,934 --> 00:05:59,369
- I'm gonna have them DM you.

124
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:00,203
- Okay.

125
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:02,616
- [Andy] Can I speak 
with you because I--

126
00:06:02,616 --> 00:06:03,992
- I want full time interns.

127
00:06:03,992 --> 00:06:05,599
I want Babins.

128
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,602
If you're coming to intern,
you're not going back anywhere.

129
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:10,103
For at least a year.

130
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:10,934
Like why?

131
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:12,973
We lose all our value.

132
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:15,642
And the other thing is like,

133
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,177
no matter what,

134
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,852
I'm talking to you 
'cause you're so recent.

135
00:06:18,852 --> 00:06:21,548
No matter what the 
person comes in with.

136
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,659
If you're good.

137
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:24,251
If you're good, I mean 
you went through,

138
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:25,685
I mean, if you're good.

139
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,644
You come in, if you're like
I'm gonna do this for a year,

140
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:29,422
I'm gonna fuckin' 
blow up my brand.

141
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,824
That's I mean, 
what did you, actually,

142
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:31,758
fuckin' let's go right to it.

143
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,127
What did you 
think was gonna happen?

144
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,329
- [Other Tyler] I mean, all 
I ever do was like work

145
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,099
for you for a year, and 
then go do my own thing.

146
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,333
- Right and now?

147
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,167
Same?

148
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,129
- [Other Tyler] But now I'm 
gonna be here for a while.

149
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:46,373
- Yeah so like because 
what happens is that,

150
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,141
that's amazing, 
because that's exactly.

151
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,276
Were you just filming that?

152
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:50,110
- [Other Tyler] Yeah.

153
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,999
- Yeah, we need, 
that is in the episode.

154
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:53,680
Because that's the punchline.

155
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,016
Dopey Phil, he interned too.

156
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,151
We are, we all understand
what's about to happen, right?

157
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,356
- How do you divide your time,
if you don't mind me asking?

158
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,209
How much is running this

159
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:24,914
and your other business
enterprises separately, your--

160
00:07:24,914 --> 00:07:26,279
- GaryVee stuff?

161
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,781
- [Matthew] Inspirational,
motivational--

162
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,349
- I would say,

163
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:30,984
it is

164
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,961
90% VaynerMedia.

165
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:34,807
Why the inspirational,

166
00:07:34,807 --> 00:07:36,500
motivational GaryVee 
thing works,

167
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,150
is 'cause there's 11 
people right there doing it.

168
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,151
- [Matthew] So little time 
gets magnified like that.

169
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:43,063
- He's recording everything.

170
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:43,897
And so,

171
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:46,503
when there's a quote card,

172
00:07:46,503 --> 00:07:50,136
when there's a 
inspirational quote on Instagram

173
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,438
that's getting viral,

174
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,139
it was just something 
I said in a meeting.

175
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,765
Especially when I hang 
out with a character like you,

176
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,366
where we take 
it to such a macro,

177
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:58,595
you might have a fuckin'
weeks worth of quote content.

178
00:07:58,595 --> 00:08:00,013
Right, you know.

179
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,385
So you have some of that stuff.

180
00:08:01,385 --> 00:08:02,355
- [Matthew] What do you mean?

181
00:08:02,355 --> 00:08:04,728
- Those, now what 
I do as an entrepreneur

182
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:06,646
'cause I don't have to do it
in a corporate environment,

183
00:08:06,646 --> 00:08:10,457
is I actually see every 
one of those things through.

184
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:11,624
When I, here's a good example.

185
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,728
Tyler, yesterday, when I was
like hey I've got an idea.

186
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,931
I make a video, 50 
seconds for a 50 year old.

187
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,766
I make it, 
I put money behind it.

188
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,901
And it's gone 
completely batshit today.

189
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,937
- Limiting the 
space between idea,

190
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,939
inspiration, and 
creation and action.

191
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,035
- And then I do tons 
of things that are bombs,

192
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:29,976
but it's easy and as long,

193
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,978
and the net 
score's always positive,

194
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,472
and it's from a yes attitude.

195
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:35,814
If you have a no attitude, 
you do none of them.

196
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:39,690
You know, like anyway, 
so this is all of this.

197
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,154
Where am I going?

198
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:44,818
(background chatter)

199
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:47,060
Hey, this is actually perfect.

200
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,144
Meet my friend Matthew.
- [Matthew] I'm Matthew.

201
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:49,469
- Ben Soffer.

202
00:08:49,469 --> 00:08:50,463
- [Matthew] Hi Ben.

203
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,297
- [Ben] Nice to meet you.
- I'm Mike.

204
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,165
- Hey Mike, Matthew.

205
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,032
- We're gonna 
have a conversation.

206
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,467
(camera shutter clicking)

207
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,736
Every brand has what you have.

208
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:58,031
Everybody's got 
somebody who's big,

209
00:08:58,031 --> 00:09:01,808
who believes and then if 
you can find the right combo

210
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:04,110
or connective tissue and 
I appreciate the chance thing

211
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,779
because I haven't 
been saying it that way,

212
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,385
that maybe the person not
only does the sponsored thing,

213
00:09:08,385 --> 00:09:10,447
but is the executive 
producer of something

214
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:12,659
that we're really 
hacking for success,

215
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:13,774
but they have their say.

216
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:15,455
Creatively, you can have--

217
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,757
- All our (mumbles).

218
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,959
- 3rd and 4th, 5th space.

219
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,868
- Sure, essentially the--

220
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:24,164
- [Gary] What's it called?

221
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,498
- I've just been 
finding whatever.

222
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,332
- No, no phone.

223
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,333
- No phone, 
just do it in person?

224
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,502
- Tell him, tell 
him no, I want it,

225
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,911
tell him I tried 
to push Gary to it.

226
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:33,373
He said this is too 
important and I hate--

227
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,375
- Got it, that 
bullshit, yeah I get it.

228
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,577
- And then like, 
call him real quick

229
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,180
and be like yo this is good.

230
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,612
When he really likes something,
when it's super important,

231
00:09:42,612 --> 00:09:44,384
he doesn't even 
wanna do phone, yeah.

232
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,552
(camera shutter clicking)

233
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,047
So, uh.

234
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:49,419
Just like that it's 3:41 P.M.,

235
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:52,696
it literally 
feels like it's 9:30.

236
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,994
I don't know man, 
being busy is amazing,

237
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,663
because you get 
so much shit done.

238
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,599
Especially the way I do it,
fives and tens and fifteens,

239
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,235
maybe there's a good 
chance, we should be doing

240
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:03,303
some new kind of editing.

241
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,438
So here's a good chance
for maybe all the B-roll

242
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,674
you caught up like 
one second, it's like..

243
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:10,610
"Out Out" is doing 
better than a TV Commercial,

244
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,045
I would actually really 
like to talk to you about

245
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,813
possibly joining the board.

246
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,815
And straight up, 
if you just wanna like

247
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,317
really fuck with the system.

248
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:20,186
- Which, six months 
ago I was more protective.

249
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,222
- It would be amazing if 
we could actually show that.

250
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,900
- [Other Tyler] Trying to think
of how I can edit it together.

251
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,559
- You can't, you can't.

252
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,596
You probably learned more about
business in the last hour,

253
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,321
than you've learned 
in your whole life.

254
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:34,443
And that's the game. 
If you wanna be an anomaly,

255
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:36,626
if you wanna be great, 
you gotta do different things.

256
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:38,628
And so I think people 
waste time all the time,

257
00:10:38,628 --> 00:10:41,364
schedule all time, 
just waste time.

258
00:10:41,364 --> 00:10:44,305
Make decisions, do 
it fast, get a lot done.

259
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:47,345
And this is 
what people tell you,

260
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:48,679
when they get 
context from my world.

261
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,682
I'm getting a weeks 
worth of work in, in a day.

262
00:10:51,682 --> 00:10:54,852
Which is why I'm 
getting so much done.

263
00:10:55,592 --> 00:10:57,261
And I think it's 
because I understand that

264
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:59,229
most things don't matter.

265
00:10:59,229 --> 00:11:00,564
And that if you 
move fast, of course

266
00:11:00,564 --> 00:11:03,443
certain plates 
will hit the ground.

267
00:11:03,443 --> 00:11:06,984
But, a lot of plates won't.
And it's a hell of a lot better

268
00:11:06,984 --> 00:11:08,819
than thinking about 
how your gonna keep

269
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:12,367
four plates up in the air. 
And never doing it.

270
00:11:13,198 --> 00:11:14,609
- [Charlie] The way 
you beat everybody,

271
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:17,601
I think, is you only get data

272
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:22,138
if somehow gut was put 
in to the atmosphere, right?

273
00:11:22,138 --> 00:11:25,763
So then people can 
make a decision on that.

274
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:28,532
Film, that song, that artist,

275
00:11:28,532 --> 00:11:30,134
but someone has 
to make a decision,

276
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:34,719
the artist's gut, the 
executive, the talent manager,

277
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:39,324
the platform. Someone has 
to put something out there,

278
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,809
for there to be data.

279
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:43,832
So the part of 
gut for data to me,

280
00:11:43,832 --> 00:11:46,420
is absolutely the most
interesting. That's why I would

281
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,011
say the next biggest talent,

282
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:49,178
is already out 
there playing somewhere.

283
00:11:49,178 --> 00:11:50,706
- [Gary] Talk to a girl today--

284
00:11:50,706 --> 00:11:55,480
- It's the process 
of finding that talent

285
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,418
and also making a bet on what
you see and what you feel.

286
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:01,713
- And what people 
have been doing

287
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:05,183
that look like you and I, 
is they curtail themselves.

288
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:08,520
Drake would have two 
albums right now if it was 1984.

289
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,155
Maybe three.

290
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:10,989
- Your right.

291
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:11,989
- [Gary] I know. I don't know

292
00:12:11,989 --> 00:12:13,040
anything about 
the music business.

293
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,613
But that part I know.

294
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:18,160
And you know, 
fucking Russ, in Atlanta

295
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,729
is only famous 'cause he 
puts out a song every week.

296
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:22,101
- Right.
- More is more man.

297
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:23,627
- Mikey actually said that
you need to be the chairman.

298
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:24,861
- And that person's right.

299
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:26,482
- [Charlie] More is more.
- More is more.

300
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:30,434
Ready? If you're good 
enough? I'm good enough!

301
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:31,260
- [Charlie] How about this,

302
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,132
we put out an album, 
it gets old by a week.

303
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:35,724
Isn't that interesting?

304
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:38,564
If you put an album 
out of 10 or 12 songs,

305
00:12:38,564 --> 00:12:41,266
what the streaming 
guys were telling us,

306
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:43,669
is the album 
becomes old very quick.

307
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:45,671
What does that mean?

308
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:47,169
Feed the beast, more is more.

309
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:48,473
- [Gary] More is more.

310
00:12:48,473 --> 00:12:49,705
- [Charlie] You made a 
hit yesterday right?

311
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:51,143
- Yes. Today.

312
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:53,900
- [Charlie] How many 
times do you put hits out

313
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,403
and how many times did you 
hit singles and doubles, right?

314
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:57,238
- Correct.

315
00:12:57,238 --> 00:12:59,373
- Right so, from a 
competitive point of view

316
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:01,105
you wanna always put,

317
00:13:01,105 --> 00:13:03,191
I always say good 
is the evil of great.

318
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:05,460
- If Drake put 
out 365 days of songs

319
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,128
for the rest of his life, he
would win. If he's capable.

320
00:13:10,128 --> 00:13:11,799
- [Charlie] Is good 
the evil of great?

321
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:14,702
- No. Good is 
the gateway to great.

322
00:13:15,772 --> 00:13:18,975
(laughing)

323
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,681
- You guys gotta follow me,
you guys gotta follow me here.

324
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:22,507
I want you to look at my shit.

325
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,733
Gary V.

326
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:27,835
- You remember me from LA right?

327
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:28,835
- [Charlie] Yeah, man. Charlie.

328
00:13:28,835 --> 00:13:31,168
- From the Ritz, this is 
the president of Republic.

329
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:32,253
- [Charlie] Hi, Charlie.
- Oh it's nice to meet you.

330
00:13:32,253 --> 00:13:35,115
- GaryVee! 
I gotta get a picture.

331
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,554
- [Gary] Let's do it man.
- There's no way.

332
00:13:36,554 --> 00:13:39,396
I got GaryVee--
- I'm here.

333
00:13:39,396 --> 00:13:41,790
- and the president of 
freaking Republic right here.

334
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,950
You kidding me.
- [Charlie] My brother.

335
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,846
- [Gary] Good guy.

336
00:13:43,846 --> 00:13:45,793
- [Julian] What kind 
of day is this?

337
00:13:46,646 --> 00:13:48,087
- [Gary] What's your name?
- Julian Bow.

338
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:50,109
I'm a huge fan, I got 
all three of your books.

339
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:51,779
- Thank you so 
much, brother. Thank you.

340
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:52,746
- Nice to meet you man.

341
00:13:52,746 --> 00:13:53,940
- [Julian] He's gonna 
own the Jets one day!

342
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,103
- That's true! That's true!

343
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,923
Remember when hip hop 
artists wanted to be athletes?

344
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,436
And athletes wanted 
to be hip hop artists?

345
00:14:01,436 --> 00:14:02,553
- They say rock 
starts wanna be musicians

346
00:14:02,553 --> 00:14:03,524
and musicians wanna 
be rock starts, yeah.

347
00:14:03,524 --> 00:14:05,815
- Right. They both 
wanna be entrepreneurs.

348
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:06,940
- Now they wanna 
be entrepreneurs?

349
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,790
- And there's only 
one entrepreneur for them.

350
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,212
(clicks tongue)

351
00:14:10,212 --> 00:14:12,219
And that's why you 
just saw what you just saw.

352
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,120
If you were confused.

353
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,205
- Shit's about to go down.

("Riot" by Jon Waltz)

355
00:14:31,323 --> 00:14:34,852
I'm feeling really 
good about what's going on.

356
00:14:34,852 --> 00:14:37,742
And you see it right, 
you see the chirping, right?

357
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,693
Doing the right thing is 
always the right thing, Tyler.

358
00:14:43,693 --> 00:14:45,509
Just is man.

359
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,195
I was so pumped you 
were in that meeting Linds.

360
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:50,136
- [Lindsay] I know.

361
00:14:50,136 --> 00:14:51,237
- You know 'cause 
I love you so much

362
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:54,607
and I know a lot about you.

363
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:57,540
And I know a lot about like, 
I just I know a lot about you.

364
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,320
And I love that that meeting, 
you're there just because

365
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,989
that's the action and the 
game and the heights

366
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:03,457
that you wanna be playing at.

369
00:15:08,028 --> 00:15:09,963
We have to have those 
meetings to make all the

370
00:15:09,963 --> 00:15:11,863
other shit 
palpable in the short term.

371

372
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,984
Yeah!

(laughing)

374
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,327
- [Man] So what we did was, 
we have a ritual in the office,

375
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,529
started seven years back
when we started this company.

376
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,732
9:30 in the morning 
they have a 15 minute ritual,

377
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:33,867
2:30 in the afternoon 
they have a 15 minute ritual.

378
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:36,069
We start with some 
kind of chanting and praying

379
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:39,239
and everybody 
embraces the energy.

380
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:42,075
You know they don't think of
the negative stuff as much.

381
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,378
Then there's a 
motivational video from GaryVee

382
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:46,580
and in the afternoon.

383
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,082
- [Gary] Wow, I'm very flattered.

384
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,517
- [Man] So I'm thinking 
does Gary even know that?

385
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:52,262
I think he's 
counting it as one view.

386
00:15:52,262 --> 00:15:54,254
And there's 120 of 
us watching two videos,

387
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:55,555
every single day for the last,

388
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,290
you know how every many years
that you've putting out on,

389
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,509
every single day.

390
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:01,418
We can not be missed 
by one person in the office.

391
00:16:02,747 --> 00:16:05,953
So these are the three 
trajectories that happen.

392
00:16:05,953 --> 00:16:08,968
(video playing on phone)

393
00:16:11,111 --> 00:16:13,780
- What up Internet Moguls? 
It's me GaryVee.

394
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,609
You may know that, I think 
you see me a whole bunch,

395
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,747
because of this dude!

396
00:16:18,747 --> 00:16:20,783
Had a great meeting, 
I just wanna send my love.

397
00:16:20,783 --> 00:16:23,419
Thank you so much for the
love that you gave me first,

398
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:26,455
and I can't wait to 
actually meet you guys.

399
00:16:26,455 --> 00:16:27,623
- [Man] Thanks, Gary.

("Riot" by Jon Waltz)

401
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,520
- Good to see you. All well?
- [Man 2] Yeah.

402
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,842
- [ASAP] Hey, 
how are you doing buddy?

403
00:16:38,842 --> 00:16:40,798
- It's a real pleasure, 
my man, how are you?

404
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:42,869
It's all good man!
- I appreciate it.

405
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,453
- What's up man?
- [Man 3] How are you, sir?

406
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:45,409
- How are you?
- [Man 3] Good!

407
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:48,188
- [Gary] It's so funny right, 
when people meet people,

408
00:16:48,188 --> 00:16:50,073
everybody thinks you are,

409
00:16:50,073 --> 00:16:52,962
like America loves 
to put you in one part.

410
00:16:52,962 --> 00:16:55,331
- [ASAP] Yeah, being a 
rapper is one part of me,

411
00:16:55,331 --> 00:16:57,437
and I went to 
college for marketing so.

412
00:16:57,437 --> 00:17:01,217
- I totally get it. 
Same thing with my crossover,

413
00:17:01,217 --> 00:17:03,453
when I started 
dropping references like

414
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:04,455
"Oh, you love hip hop?"

415
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:06,623
I'm like, "Why wouldn't I?"

416
00:17:08,468 --> 00:17:11,637
That's just America, 
America's obsessed with like,

417
00:17:11,637 --> 00:17:14,207
you're a basketball 
player, you're a painter,

418
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:15,335
you're an entrepreneur.

419
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,099
- [ASAP] This is music to my 
ear, this is just letting me know

420
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,727
everything I'm 
thinking is right.

421
00:17:18,728 --> 00:17:21,847
- [Gary] It's more 
right than you think.

422
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:23,130
(group laughter)

423
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,605
It's more right than you think.

424
00:17:25,605 --> 00:17:27,137
It's don't hedge anymore.

425
00:17:27,137 --> 00:17:27,859
- Yeah.

426
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:29,835
- [Gary] Forget everything 
you grew up with and

427
00:17:29,835 --> 00:17:31,429
you think is real. 
- [ASAP] Yeah.

428
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:34,315
- And turn it from color to
black and white, start over

429
00:17:34,315 --> 00:17:35,570
and go with that gut.

430
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,373
- [ASAP] What's going on 
in your head right now?

431
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:41,585
Are you who you wanted 
to be? In your head, already?

432
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,847
- [Gary] I always knew 
I was gonna be the biggest.

433
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:46,265
- That's what 
I'm saying so you are

434
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,666
who you wanted 
to be in your head?

435
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,667
- [Gary] Yeah.

436
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,850
- That's crazy 'cause I 
didn't think it would stop,

437
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,651
so good, it's a point 
where you get to stop.

438
00:17:53,651 --> 00:17:55,219
- [Gary] No no! No no!

439
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:56,429
- No no I'm not 
talking about stop working,

440
00:17:56,429 --> 00:17:57,973
what I'm saying--
- [Gary] No no, no no,

441
00:17:57,973 --> 00:17:59,347
you're already there too.

442
00:17:59,347 --> 00:18:00,293
- [ASAP] No.

443
00:18:00,293 --> 00:18:01,450
- No, you are let 
me explain what I mean

444
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,335
- [ASAP] Alright.

445
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:04,050
- It is and it isn't.

446
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,387
"I'm the best and 
I don't mean shit."

447
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:10,010
"I did it and 
I haven't even started."

448
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:14,981
Once you learn how to pull
from both sides, you're set.

449
00:18:14,981 --> 00:18:16,139
Let's get to know each other.

450
00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:18,852
- [ASAP] Yeah, I can't wait.

It's very close.

This? I fucking, 
I'll fit it easy.

454
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:38,819
- [Man 4] Ah, from 
the same guy. Full zip.

455
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:43,585
- Holy shit! I'm fucking
wearing this shit all the time!

Holy shit.

457
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,340
I might change. 
Holy, of course.

I'm 100%!

like an amazing package.

- You know what?

461
00:18:53,473 --> 00:18:55,819
When you decide 
somebody did it real proper?

462
00:18:55,819 --> 00:18:57,618
Come in with your 
phone, tell me who it is,

463
00:18:57,618 --> 00:18:59,132
I'll make a video 
and give 'em real love

464
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:01,109
and we gotta send it back.
- Alright, we'll do that.

465
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:04,588
- Yeah. Holy shit!

466
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:10,307
This is so swagged out.

467
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,211
It's the compound 
of the momentum.

468
00:19:17,143 --> 00:19:20,303
By the way, what about 
when I have my one video

469
00:19:20,303 --> 00:19:23,283
or one moment 
off the big famous,

470
00:19:23,283 --> 00:19:26,920
I was zero and made videos
that would get a lot of things,

471
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,455
when you got base like this,

472
00:19:28,455 --> 00:19:32,225
what I know that I'm 
gonna do, is not change.

473
00:19:34,247 --> 00:19:36,226
You evolve but I'm 
pumping out content,

474
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:37,995
like I don't give a 
fuck what's going on

475
00:19:37,995 --> 00:19:39,530
and I'm gonna say something

476
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,332
and that video's 
gonna get 47 million views.

react to the market and wait

478
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:45,769
and like you counter puncture?

00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:46,603
- Yeah

going on the offense in 2017.

happening this month,

we're doing it 
and then doing it.

483
00:19:54,578 --> 00:19:57,314
So, yeah, I'm making progress.

484
00:19:57,314 --> 00:20:00,000
- [Gary] I think I'm 
gonna do the call-in show.

485
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,167
- [Emily] Oh yeah?
- [Gary] Yeah.

486

couple of hip hop dudes

492

and they all just DM'd you.

493

Yesterday they were like,

494
00:20:22,036 --> 00:20:23,233
"Yo, what's going on with Saba?"

495
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:25,402
"Why are they
meeting with Gary?"

496
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:27,736
"Does he listen to my music?"
