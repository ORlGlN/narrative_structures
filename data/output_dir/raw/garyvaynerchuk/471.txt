1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,540
- Let's do this. 
(audience cheers)

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,860
- Okay, Gary, first question.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,818
Gonna keep it real easy, you
have 1.2 million followers on

4
00:00:07,818 --> 00:00:11,115
Twitter, well done there, your
channel's all over the place.

5
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:13,911
Stitcher, Snapchat, 
Facebook, YouTube,

6
00:00:13,911 --> 00:00:17,969
iTunes, Soundcloud, 
what's your favorite?

7
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:23,023
- My favorite, I think this is
similar to what a lot of people

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,392
asked me what my 
favorite wine is, you know?

9
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,301
I don't necessarily 
have a favorite.

10
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:29,296
I think we go through momentum.

11
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:32,098
I would think Twitter has
historically been my favorite

12
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,302
platform 'cause it's the easiest
one natively from a UI/UX

13
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:38,438
standpoint for me to engage
with all of you which is really

14
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:39,573
valuable to me.

15
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:43,577
Snapchat right now is you
know and obviously a lot of the

16
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:46,380
people in here who are either
watching or in the room know if

17
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,586
they follow me I'm very fond
of and what I really love about

18
00:00:49,586 --> 00:00:52,986
that is when I have the chance
to reply one-on-one in that

19
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,155
environment, I get 
even more of a lift.

20
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:59,293
To me, what I love social media
for is a little bit different

21
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,193
than I think most people.

22
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:04,998
I truly believe that most people
are way to over focused on the

23
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:10,037
distribution of their content in
that environment and for me I'm

24
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:13,280
very much focused on that 
but I do believe that it is a

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,743
platform that allows for 
scaling the unscalable,

26
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,478
the one-to-one engagements.

27
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,348
I know a lot more about the
people in this room they could

28
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:25,819
ever imagine and I think that's
how you build actual community

29
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:30,257
and depth and so for me the
tools that allow that the most

30
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,359
are the ones that are 
most interesting to me.

31
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,328
And so, you know 
I'll be honest with you,

32
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:37,698
even the change on Twitter to
the heart where I'm now instead

33
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:40,767
of like which felt weird like
some he says something nice.

34
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,469
It's amazing a 
little subtle things work.

35
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,770
If somebody here said something

36
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,240
I never liked 
anything on or starred.

37
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,544
I never favored anything on
Twitter that one here would say

38
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:53,413
about me but the heart because
of the way that works in the

39
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:57,184
other platforms is more of a
appreciation for you giving me

40
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:00,153
love and then it's a scalable
way for me to create context

41
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:03,190
with you to let you know 
that I'm paying attention.

42
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,659
Tools that allow me 
to prove that it's me.

43
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,361
I'm always 
stunned how many people,

44
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:10,697
even after a decade, are still
questioning if I'm doing it.

45
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,734
So Twitter video, 
Snapchat's incredible for that.

46
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,536
It's a place where I get to
prove I'm actually reading it.

47
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:17,804
I'm actually engaging with it

48
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,873
and so I think 
that's super important.

49
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:24,244
So, my favorite ebbs and flows

50
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:27,414
but always my favorite thing is

51
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:31,184
the one that allows me to create
depth on a one-to-one basis

52
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:35,355
which then allows me to build
actual relationship with people

53
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,824
who then amplify organically the

54
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,260
stuff that 
I'm actually pushing out.

55
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,530
I believe the work that I put
into actually have relationships

56
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,365
with the people I've known a
long time and things of that

57
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:50,037
nature create a scenario that
allows when I put out something

58
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,974
the threshold for them to share
it because it came for me is

59
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,910
probably little bit lower
because I have equity that I've

60
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,647
gained through not my words but
through my actions and so those

61
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:01,715
are the kind of like checks

62
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,817
and balances that 
I'm trying to figure out.

63
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:04,484
- Okay.

64
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,443
In your opinion is 
social media a marketing tool?

65
00:03:07,443 --> 00:03:08,762
- 100%.

66
00:03:08,762 --> 00:03:10,323
Anything the world that

67
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,683
has people's attention 
is a marketing tool.

68
00:03:13,683 --> 00:03:17,397
Like football jerseys 
are a marketing tool because

69
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,799
you're looking at them.

70
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,301
Social media is a slang term
for the current state of the

71
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,971
internet and I think the
internet is a marketing tool.

72
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,406
- You say about 
marketing tools and

73
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,874
social media 
being a marketing tool.

74
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,544
I have like, I was thinking
of questions earlier today.

75
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,478
I've been going through other

76
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:33,046
questions of 
people that asked you.

77
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,333
Through all the Q&amp;A's.

78
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,117
I was like, I want 
to talk to you about VR

79
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,318
but in a different way.
- Okay.

80
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:43,270
- Facebook bought Oculus back
in 2014 and apart from doing a

81
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,593
little thing with Samsung and
obviously the 360Â° videos that

82
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,928
they're now 
starting to roll out.

83
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,329
I want to know 
your thoughts on this.

84
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,498
What do you think and 
how do you think Facebook

85
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,900
are going to use that purchase?

86
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,536
What are they going do with
VR in a social media context?

87
00:03:56,536 --> 00:04:00,314
- I personally believe that 
Mark Zuckerberg is the single

88
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:04,606
best day trader of 
attention in the world.

89
00:04:04,606 --> 00:04:05,836
If you think about it

90
00:04:05,836 --> 00:04:09,753
when he bought Instagram 
for $1 billion couple years ago

91
00:04:09,753 --> 00:04:12,252
I think you guys all might 
remember everybody freaked out.

92
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,154
It was only 550 
days old, the company.

93
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:16,690
A lot of people haven't even
created their Instagram account

94
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,759
yet and here's a billion dollar
exit several years ago when

95
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,563
a billion was more 
than it is today, right?

96
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:24,998
Just to remind everybody,

97
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,701
I get a lot of credit 
for being early on Snapchat.

98
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,199
18 months ago Mark tried to

99
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,988
buy Snapchat for 
$3 billion, right?

100
00:04:32,988 --> 00:04:37,477
$3 billion for Snapchat
where only now in the last 60,

101
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:40,149
90 days have 
people said wait a minute.

102
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:43,950
He bought Oculus 
because I believe,

103
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,485
and I don't 
know this for a fact,

104
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:49,456
Mark understands that the only
arbitrage to the internet itself

105
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,158
is going to be VR.

106
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:55,562
So VR is not gonna arbitrage
social or how is it going to

107
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:59,633
work together, VR arbs 
out the internet itself.

108
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,470
VR becomes the next 
platform where our attention is.

109
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,473
You put on those contact lenses
and the reason for all of you

110
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,676
that follow me I keep saying
contact lenses it's an ode to

111
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,812
what I think is gonna happen
which is I don't think VR on a

112
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,816
consumer level is going to grow
as fast as a lot of people do

113
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,185
and by the time they do,

114
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:21,188
I don't think it's going 
to be some conky headset.

115
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,823
I think we'll be into 
contact mode in a decade when

116
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,125
I think it actually hits scale.

117
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:29,496
I think VR right now is far
more similar to internet 1992,

118
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:33,833
'93 then like tomorrow all of
you are gonna be watching your

119
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,036
movies and playing 
video games on headsets.

120
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,271
That's too big of a jump.

121
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,508
You know, we're slow.
- Yeah.

122
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,943
- Like we're 
slower than we think.

123
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,911
Like think about how
much you buy on e-com.

124
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,646
This is, by the way, 
we're in the U.K.

125
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,910
This is a mature e-commerce
market and still think about how

126
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,852
much shit you buy 
at the store. Right?

127
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:56,590
So we don't do things as
fast as people think at scale.

128
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,258
Obviously, 
there's early adopters.

129
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,594
There's plenty of nerds in
Silicon Valley that are gonna

130
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:05,365
put headsets on and VR it out
but at scale I mean people in

131
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,167
this country side, right?

132
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,637
I mean middle America, that's
gonna take a much longer time

133
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,505
but the reason he 
bought it is because

134
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,975
Zucks is playing for keeps.

135
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,409
Like Mark Zuckerberg's gonna run

136
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,678
Facebook until 
he dies in his mind.

137
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,441
He's a young man and I think
he's more similar to a

138
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:25,389
Jeff Bezos like CEO where he 
doesn't care if Wall Street looks

139
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:27,838
at the line item 
of $2 billion and goes,

140
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:30,891
"You suck because there's not 
as much profit this quarter."

141
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,693
He'll be thrilled for the stock
to go to 20 because he knows in

142
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,129
24 months a stock 
will be at a buck, 20.

143
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:36,830
- Yeah.

144
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,400
- And when will we be 
interacting with you on VR?

145
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,137
- You know, for me, I'll be 
there as early as I think

146
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,054
there's enough meaningful
scale to get learnings from.

147
00:06:47,054 --> 00:06:47,818
- Mhmmm.

148
00:06:47,818 --> 00:06:50,744
- So you know a lot of 
people are like you're so,

149
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,078
you predicted a 
lot of things right.

150
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,280
You're so disruptor 
or whatever, you know?

151
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,182
I think I'm practical.

152
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,718
I actually just wait like 
I haven't predicted anything.

153
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:03,456
I've just moved very quickly
when Facebook or Twitter or

154
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:08,128
Tumblr or YouTube or email or
Google AdWords was at some scale

155
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:11,264
that was more meaningful
then the rest of you thought.

156
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,266
- That's like with 
the Snapchat things.

157
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:17,370
Supposedly, it's not supposedly 
you were looking at it in 2013

158
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,872
and people would always say 
oh, he's only on it now.

159
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,141
It's like, you look at it, 
you analyze the product.

160
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,443
You think do I do it, yet?

161
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,147
- The best thing that's going
on for me right now is with

162
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:29,883
Snapchat and with 
DailyVee I'm document,

163
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:32,185
and The #AskGaryVee, I'm
documenting so much more of my

164
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,620
thoughts in depth.

165
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,710
So a lot of things that are 
I know are gonna play out in

166
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,394
24, 36 months, I'm gonna have a
lot more video around then I did

167
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,030
with like one or two talks where
I talked about Snapchat three

168
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,665
years ago so I'm excited.

169
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,469
I'm excited that also a lot of
you can make fun of me in two or

170
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,171
three years on things 
that I was wrong about.

171
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,673
I like the meritocracy of 
having those conversations.

172
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:57,110
The reason I'm not scared though
is I don't really bet that hard.

173
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,479
For example, think 
of it as real estate.

174
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,182
I'm not gonna go in the middle
of absolutely nowhere and see an

175
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:05,218
amazing beach and 
there's no infrastructure,

176
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,920
there's no roads, 
there's no airport,

177
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,154
there's no people but it's the

178
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,223
most gorgeous 
beachfront I've ever seen.

179
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,958
I'm not gonna buy that property.

180
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,260
That's 20 years away but

181
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,796
where I would go is 
that is that infrastructure.

182
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:20,367
I wasn't the first guy or gal
that bought there but I'm buying

183
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:24,904
it 36 months, 60 months 
before it really pops.

184
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,706
That's how I play 
in these platforms.

185
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,408
I'm not the first user.

186
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,743
I'm not the second user.

187
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:34,246
I'm on Peach right now, I'm
paying attention but I only have

188
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:36,249
to check it every 30, 60 days.

189
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,585
I'm not there 
checking it every hour, right?

190
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,755
I'm paying 
attention to Kik, right?

191
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:44,491
I'm paying 
attention to these platforms.

192
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,092
I'm paying attention to Anchor.

193
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,505
You guys know this, 
I've been throwing it out there

194
00:08:48,505 --> 00:08:49,529
but I'm not there everyday.

195
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,297
I'm not 
producing for it every day.

196
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,632
It's kind of over there.

197
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,134
I know about it.

198
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,436
I know why I'm paying 
attention whether the founder,

199
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:59,880
whether the thesis, whether
consumer behavior but

200
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,942
I don't talk about shit 
I don't believe in.

201
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:06,880
And so, I'm actually quite
boring for periods of time.

202
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,851
If some of you, met a really
tall young man back there he

203
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:12,652
said I've been watching since

204
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,487
episode 10 of 
The #AskGaryVee Show.

205
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,855
#AskGaryVee Show is funny to me.

206
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,057
If you watch the 
first hundred episodes

207
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,160
all I talk about is Facebook.

208
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,629
Like it's so underpriced so and
then all of a sudden you know

209
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:27,333
episode 175 to episode 300 I'll
just talk a lot about Snapchat

210
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,241
and influencers on Instagram.

211
00:09:29,241 --> 00:09:34,007
I don't need and then if you
talk to me about my pillars like

212
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,276
work ethic, 
you know, self-awareness,

213
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,678
all this stuff, 
I'm never gonna change.

214
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,414
Like I just want to, you know,
the lucky thing for me is the

215
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,385
world changes and I deploy my
thesis on the new thing but at

216
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:49,022
it's essence you can 
get bored of me real quick.

217
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,724
- So if you were 
starting out now,

218
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,293
where would you begin?

219
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:56,029
- Well, I would 
reverse engineer myself first.

220
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,764
So, if you're sitting 
out here and starting it now,

221
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,867
like A, you have to understand
that creating content is the

222
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,203
cost of entry to 
being relevant in society.

223
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:09,008
Whether you're a person or a
business the creation of content

224
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:12,946
on these platforms is the 
cost of entry to relevancy.

225
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:13,847
So the first thing I would do

226
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:17,350
is say what can 
I do to create content.

227
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,985
Am I good at writing?

228
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,120
Am I good at video production?

229
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,355
Should I audio it?

230
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,657
I think everybody here is the
reverse engineer themselves.

231
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,393
For me, video is the 
most powerful platform.

232
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,061
It's been proven.

233
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,563
Movie and TV stars are more
famous like this is just the way

234
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,532
it is. So I got lucky.

235
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,667
I light up when 
the camera comes.

236
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:39,472
I get going. 
I can't write a sentence.

237
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,675
I can't even imagine the jokes
my team makes at VaynerMedia,

238
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,177
I don't think I've even written

239
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:47,013
in the body of an 
email in three years.

240
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:47,914
(audience laughter)

241
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,883
Everything I have to say 
is gonna come in the title,

242
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:50,817
and that's
gonna be it and.

243
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,819
I don't even use
commas, I go dot-dot,

244
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,320
it takes me 
longer to do what I do.

245
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,221
That's how bad my grammar is.

246
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,424
I'll go dot-dot-dot-dot, it
takes me longer than the comma.

247
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,060
I can't even get myself 
to use commas because I don't

248
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,631
understand grammar and 
so, so that's a bad idea.

249
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,766
So I think the first thing I
would do is I would sit here and

250
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:10,870
say how do I communicate and if
the answer is none of the above,

251
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,305
you should team 
up with somebody.

252
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:12,972
- [Stephen] Yeah.

253
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,807
- Because you 
have to communicate.

254
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,944
You have to 
communicate and create but

255
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,145
it has to be authentic.

256
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,713
I often talk about
the 23-year-old,

257
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,950
24-year-old business coach
that's never built a business.

258
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,785
Like that pisses me off.

259
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:29,122
And so, I'd much rather a
24-year-old that wants to make

260
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:32,058
money off of people talk
about the journey of becoming a

261
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,167
business person 'cause that's
actually what they're going

262
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:37,830
through versus faking it.

263
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,366
I also think it's massively
important to put out content

264
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,036
around what you actually do.

265
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,972
In 2006, when YouTube was super
young and I'm about to start a

266
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,308
show this is early internet,

267
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:51,311
web 2.0 if you think 
about where were talking about,

268
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,713
everything that people 
watched was about tech.

269
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,416
It was Tech TV, it was Scoble, 
it was Kevin Rose,

270
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,986
Diggnation and I'm like, "Shit,
I'm gonna do a wine show."

271
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:04,390
Wine show is not, 
wine's not mainstream ever

272
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,058
and never will be.

273
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,859
I remember everybody after
it was successful was like,

274
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,194
"Oh, but you had a 
great subject matter."

275
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,196
I'm like, "Do you know how many
fucking people care about wine?"

276
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,001
(audience laughter) 
Like 11.

277
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,803
But I knew that I had a talk
about something authentic.

278
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:17,837
- Right.
- Yeah.

279
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,340
- In the same way that 
I knew as things were evolving,

280
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,342
that in my heart is like 
you know I don't want to be

281
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,276
America's wine guy.

282
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:26,846
There's a lot of people that
could be a better wine critic

283
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,649
and wine personality than me
but what I am good at is this

284
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:30,483
business marketing thing.

285
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,486
I better start producing content
from that 'cause that is coming

286
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,320
from an authentic place.

287
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,090
It's how I built all this.
- Yeah.

288
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,958
If you're like passionate
about something then it also

289
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,060
tells in the content 
you create and you were and

290
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,462
you are extremely passionate.
- Yes.

291
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:46,733
But a lot of people confuse
my first story of Crush It!

292
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:49,930
You know, it's not like just
'cause you love football or

293
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,539
hip hop or roses that 
you're entitled to build

294
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,842
a million dollar 
business around that.

295
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,444
Passion is massively 
important, I'll tell you why.

296
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:03,716
Work ethic is an absolute pillar
of variable to being successful.

297
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,184
And if you're 
passion about something,

298
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,719
it doesn't feel like work.

299
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,388
And that's a big deal.

300
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:11,891
If you feel like if you're
working on your side hustle from

301
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,193
6 to 2 in the morning, 
6 P.M., 7 P.M.,

302
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:17,563
right, and you're not up for
it like you're forcing yourself

303
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,699
because you need 
the money or the dream.

304
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:20,933
You've fucked up.

305
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,802
You picked the wrong thing.

306
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,639
To punt all your leisure and all
your friends and family and to

307
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,509
work on something and to be
tired the next day 'cause you

308
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,511
have to get up for work which
you really don't want to do

309
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,579
which is why you're 
building your side hustle.

310
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,549
That has to be about your
passion because it's just too

311
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,817
hard if it's not.

312
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,895
It can't be about 
where you think you can

313
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:40,553
make the most money.

314
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,156
What I don't think people
understand is you can make a lot

315
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,692
more, like there's a lot, 
so I wrote Crush It!

316
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:46,926
a long time ago.

317
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:50,830
The emails that I get, I get way
more people that are making 50

318
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,733
to 200,000 a year 
talking at the craziest,

319
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:56,202
like the emails 
I get are so bananas.

320
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,539
Like, well bananas is in my
Snapchat so I won't use that.

321
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:03,374
Like, "Hey, GaryVee, 
you know, I read Crush It!

322
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:08,064
"in 2009 and 
I'm making $74,000 a year

323
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:12,051
"in ads and selling T-shirts
around raspberry jam only."

324
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,653
(audience laughter)

325
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:16,756
I've had a lot more 
people make money deep,

326
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,658
deep, deep in the 
longest tail niche

327
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,193
that you could 
have ever thought of.

328
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,362
Hip hop stars from 1986 to 1989.

329
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,430
This is a real one.

330
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,834
There's a guy who only talks
about hip hop from '86 to '89

331
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,770
'cause he was in high school
during those years and now he's

332
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:35,174
like now he gets paid like five
to $10,000 a month retainer to

333
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:38,711
do hip hop consulting for
companies that came from the

334
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,246
content he was putting out.

335
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:40,913
- That's so amazing.

336
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,849
- He stopped 
being an accountant.

337
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:46,085
(audience laughter) 
Right?

338
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,721
But the people 
that are losing are,

339
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,890
I tried to build an 
affiliate marketing company.

340
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,392
I tried to do $500 e-books.

341
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,662
They went for the money, 
they had no patience.

342
00:14:56,662 --> 00:15:00,433
The hip hop guy and the
raspberry jam girl and this guy

343
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,970
had years of nobody 
giving a shit before we popped.

344
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,640
I did Wine Library TV for two
years with not with crickets.

345
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,307
Crickets.

346
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,642
- What kept you 
going during that time?

347
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,286
- 'Cause I knew I was right.

348
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,079
- (laughs) That's 
what kept him going.

349
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,914
He was right.
- That's exactly right.

350
00:15:16,976 --> 00:15:19,465
I know and don't forget and
there was something else

351
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:22,789
that's a little, that's a little
bravado what I also had the

352
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,158
history of how 
I built Wine Library.

353
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,093
Everybody said I was wrong
to do an e-commerce site.

354
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:30,630
My dad got scolded by his liquor
buddies saying you should open a

355
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:35,034
second store not 
this internet fad, right?

356
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,436
When I didn't do a catalog like
everybody did catalogs 'cause

357
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,806
I was doing 
email that was stupid.

358
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,574
'Cause catalogs were 
the establishment of

359
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:44,210
how wine store sold product.

360
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,853
When I was buying Google AdWords
instead of doing more

361
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:49,515
direct mail and took 
direct mail dollars out of that,

362
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:53,019
that was stupid 'cause
direct mail is what got us here.

363
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,720
What gets you somewhere is never

364
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,690
the thing that gets 
you to the next spot.

365
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,091
- Yeah.

366
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:01,327
We good in the audience to

367
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,762
grab some questions 
from you guys now?

368
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,530
- Oh, they'll roll.
- Microphone up.

369
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,766
- Yeah, let's give 
those who got tickets first.

370
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:10,536
- Okay, raise your hand if you
want to ask Gary a question.

371
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,112
Louise, can you get to 
the man in the blue there?

372
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:15,541
We'll come to the 
front in a sec as well.

373
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,243
Introduce yourself, 
your name and where you work

374
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,345
and what you do.

375
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,514
- [Warren] Hey, I'm Warren.
- Stand up, we can't see you.

376
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,482
Please.
- Oof, you work them hard.

377
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,953
- I'm not, what stand up?

378
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,121
- [Warren] What advice would
you give to one of the world's

379
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:32,859
biggest brands that has just
started selling products online?

380
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:34,927
- One of the world's 
biggest brands that's selling

381
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:35,995
now direct to consumer.

382
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,297
- No, that is just starting to
sell our products direct online.

383
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,262
- Just starting.
- [Warren] Yeah.

384
00:16:39,262 --> 00:16:42,034
- But before has been 
selling it through retailers.

385
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,470
- In the wholesale market.

386
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,807
- So, first thing I would say is
make sure your channel conflicts

387
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,076
are all set and 
you have no issues.

388
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:53,613
So one of the biggest issue in
the game right now is a lot of

389
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,015
big brands want to go direct
to consumer as infrastructure's

390
00:16:56,015 --> 00:17:01,087
getting built up but if you
create a little bit of friction

391
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:03,256
between the people that actually
sell your products 'cause you're

392
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:05,999
arb'ing around them so first 
I would say politically make

393
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:09,301
sure that what you're doing, 
you don't try to like cut your

394
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:10,795
nose despite your 
face because you have

395
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:11,564
to have those relationships.

396
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,217
Number two, I would say to make
sure that the people that have

397
00:17:14,217 --> 00:17:17,336
been involved in the wholesale
business are not involved in the

398
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,771
DTC business.

399
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,272
That you need to create a
completely autonomous division

400
00:17:21,272 --> 00:17:23,475
that understands that 
because they are very,

401
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:26,444
B-to-B and B-to-C are very
different businesses and

402
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:28,079
require very different skills.

403
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,584
The other thing I would say is
please understand there's a very

404
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:35,354
big difference between being a
salesman and a transactor and

405
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,623
being a brander and a marketer.

406
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,593
One of biggest mistakes is
big brands go from into this

407
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:43,996
environment and then they're
taught that this is a quant play

408
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,899
and it's all math conversion and
all the things that helped them

409
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,234
build the biggest 
brand in the world,

410
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:53,172
branding they punt and they just
care about last attribution,

411
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,407
you know, conversion based.

412
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,274
You know how many people in this
room did not jump on Snapchat

413
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:59,168
because they didn't understand
the ROI and how to convert the

414
00:17:59,168 --> 00:18:02,014
ROI or understand what the ROI
was of the video 'cause there

415
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,784
was no direct attribution 
in a digital environment.

416
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,218
'Cause they're salespeople.

417
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,853
Because they're transactors.

418
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,656
They're not branding 
and marketing people, right?

419
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,225
Like these mother 
fuckers right here,

420
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,329
they didn't cookie me no the
internet and follow me around

421
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,165
with banner ads and I gave up
and I bought this pair of shoes.

422
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,133
(audience laughter) 
Right?

423
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,783
I bought these because I blindly
was fed it somewhere over the

424
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:26,472
last 30 years that this 
is what I'm doing, right?

425
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:30,076
So big brands I think make
the mistake of going way too

426
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:33,279
transactional because they'll
bring in a separate team that

427
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,649
are digital marketers, that are
quant based and it's like last

428
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:39,719
touch on Google, last touch
on Facebook and they lose the

429
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,821
essence of branding and
marketing which would force them

430
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:45,257
then to make three and four
minute videos on Facebook where

431
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,026
they could do much 
better commercials.

432
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,327
They could do content.

433
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,562
Where they would do Instagram

434
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,530
and Snapchat as 
emerging platforms.

435
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,400
Where they would do content deal
so those are some of the pillars

436
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,036
I would top line, religious
things I would think about.

437
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,323
- Thank you.

438
00:18:59,323 --> 00:19:02,659
Tall man at the back 
who was referenced earlier.

439
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:05,701
Good luck, Louise 
getting over there.

440
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:06,591
- [Man] Gary,--
- Yes?

441
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:08,429
- [Man] I'm the tall guy.
- Yes, I'm aware.

442
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:11,484
- [Man] What advice would you
give to a VP of marketing in a

443
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,286
brand new startup when it seems
like there's everything to do?

444
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,922
Where should your focus 
be in the first six months?

445
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,725
- I think 
startup marketing people,

446
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,294
first of all, this 
is a weird thing to say.

447
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,864
I would tell you probably
as, and this is a generalized

448
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:28,200
statement, but I would tell
you that the marketing people at

449
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,303
startups that have less than
20 employees are probably the

450
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,740
weakest group of marketing 
people I know right now.

451
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,302
I've been really 
grossly disappointed

452
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:40,012
with the talent at that level.

453
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,082
Mainly 'cause startups have
not dragged down people with

454
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:46,952
experience, they'd given people
upstarts an opportunity which is

455
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:50,823
great and I love that but it
sure leaves a lot to be desired.

456
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,059
I would tell you the first thing
that I tell them and I speak to

457
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:56,896
a lot of them hence the thing
I'm concerned about is there's

458
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:59,899
just complete misunderstanding
of what marketing is about.

459
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,802
Marketing is a function 
to create an action that

460
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:05,971
a company wants to happen.

461
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,340
So I would tell 
them to reverse engineer,

462
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,577
like I would ask, like I asked
marketers like what you want.

463
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,080
I literally had conversations
where I asked a marketer in a

464
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,182
startup like what 
you want to happen and

465
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,500
they can't answer it for real.

466
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,053
And the answer needs to be
whatever the fucking business

467
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,321
needs to happen tomorrow.

468
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,255
(audience laughter) 
Right?

469
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:26,859
'Cause when you're a startup,
so the carnage that is about to

470
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:30,377
happen in startup land that 
I can't wait for once we have

471
00:20:30,377 --> 00:20:33,636
our next economic slowdown is 
gonna be really gratifying for

472
00:20:33,636 --> 00:20:38,358
me because I have become 
stunningly disgusted with

473
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:40,139
what's really 
happening in startup land.

474
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:42,808
Which is nobody's 
building companies anymore,

475
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,411
everybody's just building
machines that are built for the

476
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,446
next round of funding.

477
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,648
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

478
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,017
So I would tell the marketer 
to do their fucking job.

479
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:55,421
I would tell her or him to say
you know what is your business

480
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,356
trying to do and how do you make

481
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:00,059
that happen for the 
least amount of money?

482
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,093
- Good.

483
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,528
Before we go 
back out to audience,

484
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:05,164
I've got a few questions
from the Facebook live stream.

485
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:08,667
Thank you guys for joining 
us there around the world.

486
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:09,869
- Worldwide.

487
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:13,506
- Worldwide, 
global all in one place.

488
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,559
But the two questions we've got,
well we've actually got quite a

489
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:18,444
few but they're along the line
of how would your personal style

490
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,380
work in a more 
conservative U.K. market?

491
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,915
And then another 
one to follow up with,

492
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:26,285
how does Gary see the difference
with U.K. and U.S.A. marketing?

493
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,095
- So I haven't played hard, like
one of the things I pride myself

494
00:21:29,095 --> 00:21:31,390
in is not talk 
about shit I don't know.

495
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,859
I haven't been, and we haven't
marketed here long enough for me

496
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:37,062
to feel comfortable on answering
the second part of the question.

497
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,230
I see the data.

498
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,466
Facebook arbitrage is 
better in the U.K. market

499
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,433
than the U.S. market.

500
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,836
Every one of you should be
running Facebook ads if you want

501
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,971
to do business in 
this market tomorrow.

502
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:46,639
Figure it out.

503
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,942
One test that didn't work
doesn't mean it doesn't work.

504
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:54,046
So number one, I know that from
data but still there's creative

505
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,481
variables that impact that.

506
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,250
This is a more
mature e-com market.

507
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,899
Everybody has their own things,

508
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:04,089
so the data supports enormous

509
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,992
opportunity in the U.K. market
for U.K. consumer because

510
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,362
there's a lot more traditional
execution going on here by the

511
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:13,899
company's yet a lot of you are
just far more advanced actually

512
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,367
than the American counterparts

513
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,670
on the way you buy 
stuff through the internet.

514
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,606
That's a huge opportunity 
as you can imagine.

515
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,808
On the first part,
you know listen,

516
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,977
I rub people wrong.

517
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,712
I'm too American for Americans.

518
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,515
(audience laughter) 
So I think, you know,

519
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:33,755
on common sense there'll clearly
be some people that won't love

520
00:22:33,755 --> 00:22:37,936
what I'm gonna do but 
I'm not worried about that.

521
00:22:37,936 --> 00:22:41,160
I have nothing but 
respect for everybody.

522
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,463
I'm just really comfortable in
communicating with passion and

523
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,631
my point of views.

524
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:47,099
I want only good.

525
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,501
Here's what I'm grounded in
I want to build the biggest

526
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:53,505
building in town and my plan
on doing that is to build the

527
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,074
biggest building in town.

528
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:57,486
And I think what most people
do is tear down all the other

529
00:22:57,486 --> 00:22:58,788
buildings around them.

530
00:22:58,788 --> 00:23:00,980
And I think once people get
a real read on me and they

531
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,984
understand that's how I roll, 
all the bravado and the,

532
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:08,053
you know, hustle and all that
stuff starts to become more

533
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:12,524
palpable because I'm not trying
to do it at anybody's expense.

534
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,794
I'm trying to when 
I say, "Hey, dick face,

535
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,497
"you need to get serious about
this," it's because you haven't

536
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:21,700
listened to people say it nicely
for two years and that's what

537
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,169
I think you need to actually
maybe think about it for

538
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,505
30 seconds because you're 
clearly not doing the right

539
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:29,875
thing so let's figure out what
communication style needs to be

540
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,678
deployed right now to actually 
make you do something because

541
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:35,381
here's the 
biggest problem I have.

542
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:39,943
My biggest competitor in 
the world is your success.

543
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,891
The biggest problem I have is
when companies are doing good.

544
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,493
Good scares the shit out of me.

545
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:50,029
We're up 9%.

546
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,431
You know, that's scary to me
'cause that means you're not

547
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,769
going to do anything to change
and usually what happens after

548
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:00,874
being up 9% is not being up 9%

549
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:02,474
and it predicated on do you want

550
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,744
to change and be 
up 15 or 19 or 22% or

551
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,713
do you want to be down 1%?

552
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:10,232
And so, yeah, listen,

553
00:24:10,232 --> 00:24:13,852
I will pull every lever 
of anything I have to do

554
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:17,323
to communicate not because 
I want to be funny or 'cause

555
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:21,126
I think it's cool because I'm
desperate to help the other

556
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,563
person on the communication to
do something that I think is

557
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,332
meaningful towards 
what they want to do.

558
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:28,734
- Yeah, your one-on-one
communication with like the

559
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:30,369
whole community is unparalleled.

560
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:33,539
I've not seen anybody else put
so much time in to it and it's

561
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,107
because it's something 
you're passionate about.

562
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:38,477
- I totally agree and I'm
stunned by people's inability as

563
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,346
a whole to recognize it.
- Yeah.

564
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:43,782
- I'm so pissed when I get
thrown into the conversation

565
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:47,252
with huckster marketers or
other social media experts.

566
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,750
They don't look like me.

567
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,323
Like go look at them.

568
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,726
For huckster marketers, 
I've nothing to sell you.

569
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:54,860
I got no fucking course.

570
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,261
There's is no mastermind.

571
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,230
I'm not inviting you 
to my fucking island.

572
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,531
Like I got nothing.

573
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:02,034
I got nothing, like, nothing.

574
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:05,170
And then other social media
experts if every other social

575
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,640
media expert was good as me why
do I sell 100,000 copies of my

576
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,943
book the week it 
releases on my strategies and

577
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:13,912
why do they sell a 1,000?

578
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,614
Like real quick on that.

579
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,983
All the other people that
are supposed to be experts and

580
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:21,019
social media experts, go
look at their Bookscan numbers.

581
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,622
If they're so fucking good and
they have such great advice,

582
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,095
then why can't they 
sell their own fucking book?

583
00:25:26,095 --> 00:25:27,036
(audience laughter)

584
00:25:27,036 --> 00:25:28,039
- Why do you think then they're

585
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:29,335
not doing what you're
doing because--

586
00:25:29,335 --> 00:25:32,097
- Because they're not as good
and they're not working as hard.

587
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,466
I am more talented 
and I outwork them.

588
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:37,418
(audience laughter and applause)

589
00:25:37,418 --> 00:25:40,739
That's just the real truth.

590
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,008
Why is the best soccer player

591
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,343
in the world the 
best soccer player?

592
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:46,278
Because they have 
the most talent and

593
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,680
they outworked everybody.

594
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,882
Because talent's not enough.

595
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,316
We see it all the time.

596
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,786
The number one pick doesn't 
always be the best player

597
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:56,789
because talent's not enough
and hard work's not enough.

598
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,924
I could try to be the greatest
soccer player of all time,

599
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,626
it wasn't gonna happen.

600
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:03,328
Right, so like they 
both matter and so why?

601
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:03,996
Why?

602
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:06,732
Because I like to remind 
everybody that unlike every

603
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:10,636
other social media expert, 
I built a $65 million business

604
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:12,404
before I came out 
to the world and said,

605
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,339
"Hey, I'm here. 
Let's talk about business."

606
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,975
- Where do you think 
this is gonna take you?

607
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:17,910
- Me?
- Yeah.

608
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,411
Where is this all gonna go?

609
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,679
- To winning Super Bowls.

610
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,266
(audience laughter)
- Yeah, buying the Jets.

611
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:24,383
He's all about 
buying the Jets, Stephen.

612
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:28,787
- I think realistically my dream
I love to always talk about

613
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:33,220
buying the Jets, what my real
dream is in parallel 'cause

614
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:37,496
that is my real dream is I want
to prove to the world that you

615
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:42,267
can build a financial 
empire on being a good person.

616
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,174
I think I can change the 
business landscape forever.

617
00:26:45,174 --> 00:26:46,171
- Right.

618
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:50,548
- I was very affected by 
Steve Jobs' run as the guy.

619
00:26:50,548 --> 00:26:53,275
A lot of my tech friend
started becoming mean to their

620
00:26:53,275 --> 00:26:56,246
employees because 
that's what Steve did.

621
00:26:56,246 --> 00:26:58,233
And it affected me a lot.

622
00:26:58,233 --> 00:27:02,031
And I said, huh, I 
wonder if I go and build a

623
00:27:02,031 --> 00:27:05,643
multibillion-dollar thing
on being the best with the

624
00:27:05,643 --> 00:27:07,959
community, the 
best with my employees,

625
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,208
would then people 
wake up and be like,

626
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:10,955
"Oh, I want to be like GaryVee
and that's what he did

627
00:27:10,955 --> 00:27:12,512
"and I'm gonna do 
that," and the answer is yes,

628
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,346
that's what people do.

629
00:27:13,346 --> 00:27:16,798
And so, I'm on a 
very interesting crusade.

630
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,706
I think, you know, I think
capitalism and meritocracy are

631
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:22,474
the greatest 
truths in our society,

632
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:27,513
I do believe that and so for me
I'd like to show the world that

633
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:30,849
there is absolutely ways to be
aggressive and competitive and

634
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:35,330
want to beat your competitors
faces in the ground but be a

635
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:39,191
great guy to your team in and to
the people that surround it and

636
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:41,026
build something very meaningful

637
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,661
and I think I'm in 
the process of doing it.

638
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,796
And I think what's really
intriguing about what I'm doing

639
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:47,900
is I'm documenting 
it the whole way.

640
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,802
So, you know, it's one thing to
see my content now just project

641
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:53,463
that every day, every day,

642
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,774
every day 30 years from today.

643
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,479
You know I made a 
search engine for #AskGaryVee.

644
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:01,813
I don't know if 
you guys saw this.

645
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,315
Where which is really 
incredible if you go to

646
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:06,218
ask.garyvaynerchuk.com,
I'm really proud of it.

647
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:09,777
Every word I've ever uttered
on that show is now searchable.

648
00:28:09,777 --> 00:28:12,324
And the value that I'm getting
from emails and I've been,

649
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:13,659
I've been 
promoting it a little bit

650
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:15,427
but I haven't 
really gone in yet.

651
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,229
People are really 
getting real value.

652
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:18,263
- Mhmmm.

653
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,365
- It's super cool like they're
just getting the answers to

654
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,468
their questions and I'm
like, wow imagine that at scale.

655
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:26,805
Imagine that, imagine all of the
words that every came out of my

656
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,908
mouth, this, this interview
being completely searchable

657
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:32,202
which is really cool.

658
00:28:32,202 --> 00:28:36,848
I'm really excited about, I know
my intent is and I think that

659
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,784
for people that have known me a
long time and I see some of the

660
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,909
faces around here, 
I know what people thought

661
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:44,039
I was 10 years ago,

662
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:46,692
seven years ago, 
five years ago.

663
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:50,028
I'm only winning every day that
goes by while a lot of other

664
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,564
people get 
exposed over that time.

665
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,933
- Got a question from online.

666
00:28:56,679 --> 00:28:58,337
We'd like to know which

667
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:01,206
early stage 
startups are doing it right?

668
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:04,543
- I don't know.

669
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:09,247
I would tell you that it depends
on how you define early stage.

670
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,017
Right? You know, 
I think Snapchat did it really,

671
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:15,787
really, really right but 
the truth is I'm not sure.

672
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,690
I mean which early stage 
startups are doing right?

673
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,861
The ones that are clearly going
to be profitable with their

674
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:26,264
actual business in the next 6
to 12 months because if capital

675
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:31,062
dries up and you're living
on the next round of funding.

676
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:35,207
Guys, very big startups that we
all look up to will be out of

677
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:38,043
business 36 months from today.

678
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:39,444
They'll be out of business.

679
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,341
Just watch very carefully for
the following term that you're

680
00:29:42,341 --> 00:29:46,618
gonna hear a lot about over 
the next year: down round.

681
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,522
Get used to down round 
which means XYZ startup,

682
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,814
unicorn,

683
00:29:52,814 --> 00:29:56,094
got valued at $800 million 
in their last round and

684
00:29:56,094 --> 00:30:00,132
you just heard that they
raised new money at $325 million.

685
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:00,866
Why?

686
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:03,635
'Cause nobody was going to give
them money at a higher range and

687
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:08,640
the options work go directly out
of business or heavily lower the

688
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,708
valuation of your company and

689
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:12,444
get some new 
money in to stay alive.

690
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:16,281
Down round will be a word you
hear over and over and over the

691
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,016
next 18 months because we went

692
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,719
way too crazy on 
early stage companies.

693
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:23,155
Companies were getting A and
B funding before they had any

694
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,724
business which is 
nothing like we've seen before.

695
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:28,326
It's completely broken 
and there's gonna be enormous

696
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,345
opportunity and a lot of.

697
00:30:31,345 --> 00:30:35,300
We also lived through a time
where the way one was deemed an

698
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,602
entrepreneur was predicated

699
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,705
on them saying they 
were an entrepreneur.

700
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:41,006
(audience laughter)

701
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,941
which is great but 
there's you know if

702
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,077
you said that you were a singer

703
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:48,180
or an athlete in 
our society today,

704
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,047
they would come back and

705
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,850
ask you are you a 
professional athlete?

706
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,720
Like do you get 
paid to be an athlete?

707
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,457
But in entrepreneur land every
kid in here who's got an idea

708
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:00,025
goes, "I'm an entrepreneur."

709
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:04,229
That's nice. Are you a 
professional entrepreneur?

710
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:04,896
(audience laughter)

711
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,798
Like do you make 
money and so I think that's

712
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,567
about to hit its head.

713
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:12,237
At the same token, we're about
to go through the golden years

714
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:13,138
of the internet.

715
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:14,573
Internet's starting to get, 
you know?

716
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:15,857
Internet's 20.

717
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:17,442
Remember when you hit 20?

718
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,183
Shit was starting to get cool.

719
00:31:19,183 --> 00:31:22,587
20 and 30 was fun for
everybody who went through that.

720
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:26,818
You're in, I don't know if
it's your prime but fuck you are

721
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,787
solid and I think the internet

722
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:30,922
is about to go 
through that as well.

723
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:34,226
Really the consumer web 
is only 20 years old, right?

724
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:38,263
Windows 95 is kind of what
really started the version of

725
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,731
what were seeing now.

726
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:43,835
It's young like just rewind
like everybody this room is old

727
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:47,372
enough to just rewind just 10
years ago, most of the shit we're

728
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:51,087
talking about 
right now didn't exist.

729
00:31:51,087 --> 00:31:55,932
Didn't exist or was six months
in or nine months I mean like,

730
00:31:56,658 --> 00:31:59,636
are you kidding me?
Like everything.

731
00:31:59,636 --> 00:32:02,621
We didn't have 
smart phones 10 years ago.

732
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,990
Now it's the only thing 
that matters in our lives.

733
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:08,226
(audience laughter) 
So we're just starting.

734
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,595
- I've got another 
question from here.

735
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,958
- We had the Ngage 10 years ago.

736
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:13,829
- Yes.
- Remember that?

737
00:32:13,829 --> 00:32:14,597
- Yes.

738
00:32:14,597 --> 00:32:16,768
We had stuff and 
you guys had texts,

739
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,537
you guys had 
texting before we did,

740
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:19,938
right, in the U.S.

741
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,275
We had stuff but what do you
think the world's gonna look

742
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,677
like 10 years from today?

743
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:26,912
Have you looked at how a

744
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:29,674
14-year-old lives 
her or his life?

745
00:32:29,674 --> 00:32:32,676
What do you think 
they're gonna be doing at 24?

746
00:32:32,676 --> 00:32:34,119
You think they're going 
to be clicking banner ads?

747
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,487
(audience laughter)

748
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:37,656
You think they're even 
gonna know what a laptop is?

749
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:40,875
'Cause they're not.

750
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:41,810
- [Woman] Hi Gary.

751
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,929
- Hi.
- [Woman] Hi!

752
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,534
I think most 
people in this room,

753
00:32:45,534 --> 00:32:47,279
most people you talk to are

754
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,368
trying to build an 
obsessive audience.

755
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:51,036
- Okay.

756
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:52,804
- [Woman] We actually 
have the reverse problem.

757
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,557
So we have 400 million visits

758
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:59,077
to our shopping 
centers in a year

759
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:02,013
so we're probably the 
biggest media in the country.

760
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:02,681
- Intersting.

761
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:06,518
- Now, what we want to do is
build content and everybody's

762
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:08,119
trying to grab our audience.

763
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,888
Google are trying 
to grab our audience,

764
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:13,358
everybody is and we want to make
sure that we get the right angle

765
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,396
so we can--
- Beat them.

766
00:33:15,396 --> 00:33:17,863
- [Woman] have that audience and
have a relationship with them.

767
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:19,164
What's your advice on that?

768
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,432
- Okay, so I want to make sure.

769
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:22,400
So you guys, go a 
little bit deeper.

770
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,569
You guys are in the retail,

771
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,071
bricks and mortar world, malls?

772
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:27,405
Like what are we talking about?
- [Woman] Yeah.

773
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:31,309
So we own 15 shopping malls.
- [Gary] Yes.

774
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,706
- Throughout the U.K.
- [Gary] Yes.

775
00:33:32,706 --> 00:33:36,294
- intu, by the way, everybody 
(laughs), quick plug.

776
00:33:36,294 --> 00:33:39,254
And actually the 
team here everyone wave.

777
00:33:39,254 --> 00:33:43,421
We run the digital 
side of the business.

778
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:47,459
So we're integrating digital
content with our audience and

779
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,263
2/3rds of the British 
population shop with us.

780
00:33:50,263 --> 00:33:50,925
- [Gary] Yep.

781
00:33:50,925 --> 00:33:53,896
- So we see that as an
absolutely massive opportunity.

782
00:33:53,896 --> 00:33:54,770
- Of course.

783
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,242
Because what's gonna happen over
the next 20 to 30 years is that

784
00:33:57,242 --> 00:33:59,139
number is not gonna 
go in that direction.

785
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:01,246
You'll start losing that
audience over time,

786
00:34:01,246 --> 00:34:03,536
and by the way,
I said two to three decades.

787
00:34:03,536 --> 00:34:05,895
20, 30 years 
but it will windle.

788
00:34:05,895 --> 00:34:09,273
Like the 20% of e-com business
that happens in the U.S.,

789
00:34:09,273 --> 00:34:11,389
30% here, that 
came from somewhere.

790
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:13,041
Right, it came from physical.

791
00:34:13,042 --> 00:34:14,219
It keeps getting chipped away.

792
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,688
It doesn't happen as fast as
Silicon Valley thinks it's gonna

793
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:18,822
happen which is why 
you're still not outta business.

794
00:34:18,822 --> 00:34:22,527
Whereas if this was 1996 and you
asked me in 20 years would malls

795
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:23,295
be in business I'd be like,

796
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:24,629
"Uh, they're gonna 
be in real trouble."

797
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:27,299
So I think things take 
longer than they think.

798
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:28,500
But I think you guys 
are smart enough

799
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,135
to realize you're a platform.

800
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:32,003
You're a 
physical platform, right?

801
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:36,541
So, first, this is a data war.

802
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,710
For you to have all those people
walking through your malls and

803
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,746
for you to not have all the data
of every one of those people,

804
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:46,784
phone, address, age, 
sex is a huge problem.

805
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:47,819
And you don't have it.

806
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,454
So, the first thing I would do

807
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,255
and I'm a big 
content believer, right?

808
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,792
Like, I think you guys 
should make a reality show,

809
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,694
play it on Facebook 'cause 
I think Facebook's the over the

810
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:57,862
top network that 
Netflix doesn't want to battle.

811
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:58,663
Like I think you could do

812
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,596
some incredible 
stuff in video production.

813
00:35:01,596 --> 00:35:05,503
But before you even go there,
anybody who is being arbitraged

814
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:09,341
by the internet, 
right, in the physical world,

815
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:12,477
needs to be in full 
scale data collection.

816
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:13,912
Physically.

817
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:17,849
Shit, I would incentivize 
every one of those 2/3rds,

818
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:22,454
3/4ths, 400 million, every one
of those people like tomorrow as

819
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:23,822
leaders in the 
company from a digital side,

820
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:24,889
you need to have conversations

821
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:27,959
with leaders in 
the whole organization.

822
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:28,960
You should absolutely

823
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,896
incentivize data 
collection at scale.

824
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:35,867
Fucking every food court item
should be cheaper if they have

825
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:40,136
your card so you get 
the data or the app or what.

826
00:35:40,136 --> 00:35:43,575
I should be able to park in a
better spot if I have the app.

827
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:48,313
Let me unlock with my app and 
I will trade you data for time.

828
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:52,083
Right? You have to.

829
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,418
It's super 
great that you have 3,

830
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:54,919
400 million 
people walking through.

831
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,921
They're not yours.

832
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,523
And you can make them yours.

833
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:01,359
Ironically, they're the 
shops in your malls people,

834
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,928
not yours but you can 
actually arbitrage that,

835
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:07,165
have that, own that data and
then build the next version of

836
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:11,559
yourself when and if we 
stop going to those places.

837
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:14,939
And by the way, and I think you
guys are smart enough to know

838
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,674
this, there are a lot of markets

839
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,210
where malls are 
in very big trouble.

840
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,646
If you go look at the 
Australian market with malls,

841
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,148
parts of middle 
America right now,

842
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:27,685
it's already starting to happen
and so I always think people are

843
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:31,723
gonna go to physical places, 
I just think that every day that

844
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:35,894
goes by a mall's model is
vulnerable and you should siphon

845
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:37,996
the data starting tomorrow.

846
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:41,733
- [Woman] Can I push back?
- Of course.

847
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:45,103
- [Woman] So the way we 
see malls going is leisure,

848
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:47,138
dining, experience--
- Agreed. Agreed.

849
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,407
- [Woman] so what we're
seeing with our stores and our

850
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:52,610
retailers that are there, 
so Nike perfect example,

851
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:56,781
they're creating brand
experiences within the malls--

852
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:57,716
- You're 100% right.

853
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,051
- [Woman] that are totally
immersive and the thing is--

854
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:00,819
- You and I agree.

855
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:03,855
- [Woman] people love a free day
out and a coffee at Starbucks.

856
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:05,623
- 100%.
- [Woman] And go into Nike.

857
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:08,026
So we don't think 
malls are going anywhere.

858
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:09,561
We haven't seen 
our footfall move.

859
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,762
- Yep.

860
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:13,029
- [Woman] But actually,
personally I think the big,

861
00:37:13,029 --> 00:37:16,734
massive, huge opportunity 
is not VR but AR.

862
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,402
- Yep.

863
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,851
- [Woman] So contact 
lenses, walk into the store.

864
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:20,562
- 100%.

865
00:37:20,562 --> 00:37:24,075
- [Woman] Try it on, order my
size there and then and you

866
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,444
know, could we be that 
platform for everybody?

867
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,413
- So let's play this out. 
Let's talk this out.

868
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,564
Because this is fun now.
(audience laughter)

869
00:37:31,564 --> 00:37:33,485
I agree with you 
because we both agree the

870
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:36,387
way mall today is as a 
transactional center is not

871
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:37,589
gonna work and it will evolve

872
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,158
and retail has evolved 
through all time. Right?

873
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:41,993
It's all different things.

874
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,963
The thing that I'm most
fascinated by is how top-heavy

875
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:46,564
do the experiences become?

876
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:50,381
So Nike, I know for a fact, 
is not super interested

877
00:37:50,381 --> 00:37:53,338
in driving your 
overall experience.

878
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:55,373
They're starting to 
look at locations in U.S.,

879
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,508
they're entire U.S.

880
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,943
retail strategy 
is no more malls,

881
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,771
standalone Nike.
We're fucking Nike.

882
00:38:00,771 --> 00:38:03,381
People are coming to 
the mall because of us.

883
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,316
It's part of their 
strategy, that just 100%.

884
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,652
That's not my 
opinion. That's 100%.

885
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:10,054
Now the question 
becomes how does that play out?

886
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,524
Over time how does that play out
because what you're saying is,

887
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:13,925
you're 100% right.

888
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:16,261
We are all gonna 
experience, right?

889
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:19,864
The question will become will
the top 50 brands in the world

890
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:23,201
that will have 80% of the
leverage want to keep paying

891
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:25,403
you in arbitrage when they

892
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,939
are the absolute 
driver of that experience?

893
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:31,242
That, to me, is a far more
interesting question. Right?

894
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,111
Because when it
becomes too top-heavy,

895
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,046
which it will, 
the question will

896
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,482
become what is it 
actually look like?

897
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:41,452
Because malls are great but
there's a lot of land out there

898
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:44,355
and to pay you a vig for 
something that I'm actually

899
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:48,026
driving and then I'm arb'ing to
other competitive products as

900
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:51,196
people start competing with each
other in multiple categories

901
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:52,764
becomes very fascinating.

902
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:56,067
Because not only does Nike have
this but it's very intriguing

903
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,202
that Starbucks has opened it's

904
00:38:57,202 --> 00:39:00,205
first 10 standalone 
stores this year.

905
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:03,741
This is an arb game always and
so I understand why you would

906
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,910
like it to be that way 'cause
that's the business you're in.

907
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,579
The same way I want 
things to be the way

908
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,514
I want them to 
be for my business.

909
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,483
I think the fun debate if we're
really having this battle is

910
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:16,821
when it tips to a small 
group of having the leverage,

911
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:17,789
it's no different than why

912
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,625
Amazon is now private 
labeling every category.

913
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,627
It got big enough in the U.S.

914
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:25,663
market to have enough data
to now compete with their own

915
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:30,468
partners and so malls are
not competing with e-commerce,

916
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:33,805
malls are competing with the
seven players that represent 80%

917
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:37,575
of the experiences in 15 years 
saying themselves I'm not

918
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,578
overpaying you guys for that
so I can support the other 10

919
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:42,580
cockamamie 
characters in this room when

920
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,216
everybody's coming for me.

921
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,485
- Should malls become 
content creators as well then?

922
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,888
- Yeah, I think when you're at
that big of a scale and you have

923
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,522
that big of a 
company I think everybody

924
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:52,957
should be in the media business.

925
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:53,625
- Mhmmm.

926
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:56,427
- And so, I literally
think you should do a sit-com.

927
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,129
- I would watch it. 
I would watch it.

928
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:58,997
- I really do and I think

929
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:01,933
you should 
distribute it on Facebook.

930
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:04,702
How many people 
here watch DailyVee?

931
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:08,906
It's a TV show being distributed
on Facebook and YouTube.

932
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:12,277
And now, how many of you 
watch it on a television?

933
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:14,556
So this is interesting, 
so this is interesting.

934
00:40:14,556 --> 00:40:16,848
Very small number.
One, one and a half, two, maybe

935
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:20,218
three but in 
three years all of you.

936
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:22,620
Like we're so close, right?

937
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,923
What happens when Facebook 
makes a TV where you just in

938
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:29,116
your stream hit a button and
it shows up on your TV? Right?

939
00:40:29,116 --> 00:40:30,595
We're very, very, very close.

940
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:34,332
My new Samsung TV, which Lizzie
bought against my will, 'cause I

941
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:36,668
have my Samsung joke 
that some of you have heard,

942
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:39,793
I was, I didn't 
know we got a new TV.

943
00:40:39,793 --> 00:40:43,363
I'm laying in bed, looking, I'm
approving the new DailyVee and

944
00:40:43,363 --> 00:40:45,643
it's so amazing what your eye,
it's amazing when you get used

945
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:48,413
to something UI/UX-wise that if
something changes you're like

946
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:49,314
what was that?

947
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:50,948
And you don't even, 
it's subconscious right?

948
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,317
You're so used to it.

949
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:54,519
I'm in the app, 
it's not launched yet.

950
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:55,853
I have to approve it, 
make sure, you know,

951
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:58,389
DailyVee's super scary for me by
the way for all we make 'cause

952
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,491
I'm in real business 
meetings and one word slip,

953
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:02,093
one name slip, so I have 
to actually watch these

954
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:03,227
before they come out.

955
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,696
First time I've ever 
watched my own content,

956
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:06,083
it's kind of weird.

957
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:07,398
And I'm like, 
"What the fuck is that?"

958
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:11,636
There's like this weird icon,
I click it and then fucking

959
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,471
DailyVee's playing on my TV.

960
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,173
Zero friction.

961
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:18,309
And I said holy shit 
this would work for my mom.

962
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,311
And that's when 
I know we're close.

963
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,213
- Yeah.
- Right?

964
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,215
- Did you see, did you test LBI?

965
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,617
They're now doing I think it's
three times a week they're doing

966
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,986
a morning show live on Facebook.
- 100%.

967
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,755
- It's going there.
Do a sit-com.

968
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:34,134
I'm 100% behind that idea
for this sit-com as well.

969
00:41:34,134 --> 00:41:35,760
- Down in the front here. 
Good luck, Louise.

970
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,495
(audience laughter)

971
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,932
- Pass the mic on.

972
00:41:42,723 --> 00:41:44,479
- [Gabrielle] Hi Gary.
- How are you?

973
00:41:44,479 --> 00:41:45,678
- [Gabrielle] Hello.

974
00:41:45,678 --> 00:41:50,575
I'm Gabrielle Baker and I am
probably alone here in that I'm

975
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:53,244
in the creative 
space as a voice actor.

976
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:56,533
I don't think there's 
any voice actors here.

977
00:41:56,533 --> 00:41:59,083
But, I'm slightly 
techie as well.

978
00:41:59,083 --> 00:41:59,751
- Mhmmm.

979
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:00,712
- [Gabrielle] And I'm very
into social media and I've been

980
00:42:00,712 --> 00:42:03,588
following Gary 
for few years now.

981
00:42:04,664 --> 00:42:08,475
And I really enjoyed your Fiverr

982
00:42:08,475 --> 00:42:10,395
#AskGaryVee the other day.

983
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:13,297
Mainly because the guy had such
a gorgeous voice and I loved

984
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,633
listening to it on my podcast.

985
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:18,715
But in my community there's

986
00:42:18,715 --> 00:42:20,915
so much hatred for Fiverr and

987
00:42:20,915 --> 00:42:22,105
I've stopped talking about it

988
00:42:22,105 --> 00:42:24,776
because I get these disgusted looks.

989
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:27,712
- Are you kidding? I have 
literally death mail from

990
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:31,835
designers in my inbox 
from the Fiverr episode.

991
00:42:31,835 --> 00:42:34,285
- [Gabrielle] Because we 
don't like to work cheap.

992
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,154
- Because they're losers.
- [Gabrielle] Yeah.

993
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:38,456
- And let me explain why I say
that and I'm thrilled and

994
00:42:38,456 --> 00:42:40,425
I know everybody's watching.

995
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:44,429
Any time you're mad that there's
a marketplace that drives down

996
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:47,298
the cost of your craft and you
don't realize that if you're the

997
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:50,668
best at your craft 
that has no impact on you,

998
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,670
you're a losing romantic.

999
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:56,340
There's people that--

1000
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,659
- But we're accused of damaging

1001
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,379
the industry if we market

1002
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:02,413
ourselves on Fiverr.

1003
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,549
You're bringing us all down.

1004
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:06,150
You're bringing the rate down.

1005
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,485
You're killing the industry.

1006
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:09,684
- A lot of 
people like Communism.

1007
00:43:09,684 --> 00:43:12,623
(audience nervous laughter)

1008
00:43:13,948 --> 00:43:15,467
- Feel free to tweet that.

1009
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,936
- Guys, guys, guys like

1010
00:43:17,936 --> 00:43:21,766
I get paid $80,000 
to give a speech

1011
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,801
and do shit like this.

1012
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,603
I did this for free.

1013
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,212
I get to decide what I do.

1014
00:43:29,712 --> 00:43:31,509
You don't get to decide.

1015
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:35,480
Like the speaking coaches, the
speaking bureaus of the world

1016
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,815
don't get to tell me to 
do this for free or not.

1017
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:40,952
- You decide.
- I decide.

1018
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,271
- So should I use a 
pseudonym for a 5 buck gig?

1019
00:43:43,271 --> 00:43:45,756
- [Gary] No, I think everybody

1020
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,625
should do what 
they have to do but--

1021
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,538
- Just as a platform 
to sort of advertising.

1022
00:43:49,538 --> 00:43:53,531
- [Gary] It's elitist at 
best. It's elitist at best.

1023
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:56,968
I have a huge community 
that makes no money.

1024
00:43:58,381 --> 00:44:00,302
Maybe you've been seeing this
and it's been weird it's this

1025
00:44:00,302 --> 00:44:01,706
little niche 
thing I've been doing,

1026
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:03,259
I've been pushing 
this eBay thing, right?

1027
00:44:03,259 --> 00:44:04,446
You know why?

1028
00:44:04,446 --> 00:44:07,187
Because I'm getting a thousand
fucking emails a week from

1029
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:10,248
people like, "Gary 
this $200 I made this week,

1030
00:44:10,248 --> 00:44:12,350
"like I'm feeding my kids."

1031
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,318
Like, "I bought a nice 
shirt for the first time."

1032
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,589
Like who are you 
designer to tell people that

1033
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,591
they can't make a $5 design?

1034
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:23,494
Just 'cause you have it 
good and you can get $500?

1035
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,805
They don't have any money 
and they have no awareness.

1036
00:44:26,805 --> 00:44:29,800
And they don't know how to get
people to buy their $5 logo.

1037
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,068
So here's a platform.

1038
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:32,203
You gonna be made at eBay?

1039
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:34,238
You gonna be 
mad at the internet?

1040
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:35,706
You gonna be mad that the car

1041
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:37,341
was invented 
when you had horses?

1042
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,129
(audience laughter)

1043
00:44:39,129 --> 00:44:40,811
You gonna be mad 
when VR comes along and

1044
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:42,680
wipes out all the 
internet businesses?

1045
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,617
Should we feel bad for News Corp
that the internet came along and

1046
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:48,352
Facebook and 
Snapchat came along?

1047
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,556
Should I cry for MTV 
'cause Snapchat came along?

1048
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:54,825
We're thrilled to laugh at big
companies that get arbitraged

1049
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:56,093
'cause it's in our benefit but

1050
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:59,630
when it hits home, oh.

1051
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,265
And so, that's Nazi Germany.

1052
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,200
Oh, it's just the 
Gypsies, who gives a shit?

1053
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,268
I'm not a Gypsy.

1054
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:05,369
Oh, it's just the Jews?

1055
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,637
I'm not a Jew, who cares?

1056
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:09,273
- [Gabrielle] And 
it's not $5 anymore. Is it?

1057
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:11,842
Because you can--
- If it's one cent.

1058
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:14,045
Fucking if they keep yelling
at me I'm gonna start a website

1059
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,952
where people do shit for free.

1060
00:45:15,952 --> 00:45:17,715
(audience laughter)

1061
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,850
Because I do shit 
for free now and I'm rich

1062
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:23,387
as fuck and I don't have to
because I think it's in my

1063
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:27,391
vested interest for the exposure
or the context or I'm trying to

1064
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,961
build relationships 
in a new market.

1065
00:45:29,961 --> 00:45:34,228
I get to decide not your
fucking elitist fucking opinion.

1066
00:45:34,228 --> 00:45:36,601
Get the fuck out of here. 
(audience laughter)

1067
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:38,002
Fucking pisses me off.

1068
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:38,669
- [Gabrielle] Thank you.

1069
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:40,004
- So Adam, we're 
sitting here next to GaryVee,

1070
00:45:40,004 --> 00:45:41,672
he just did the rant, 
how cool with that?

1071
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:43,241
- It was a good rant.
- That was great.

1072
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,609
- [Gabrielle] By the
way, Gary, I've got--

1073
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:46,010
- By the way, let me 
say something real quick.

1074
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:49,580
And I respect people's 
opinions on the other side.

1075
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,582
I respect it, I respect it.

1076
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:55,386
I do, like everybody has, 
they're more than entitled.

1077
00:45:55,386 --> 00:45:57,221
I don't think I'm right.

1078
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:59,824
I think I'm right for me.

1079
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:01,258
And I just don't 
want somebody to tell me

1080
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,694
what I can and can not do.

1081
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:06,697
But like, we have to 
recognize market behaviors.

1082
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:09,000
They're real.

1083
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,734
There's people 
that get paid

1084
00:46:09,734 --> 00:46:12,726
$100,000 a day to 
shoot photography.

1085
00:46:12,726 --> 00:46:14,138
And then there's 
people that do it for free.

1086
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:15,973
That's just the game.

1087
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:18,009
And I think what people don't
understand is there's a lot of

1088
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:19,510
people that are at zero.

1089
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:23,381
They're at zero and like some of
these platforms can help and by

1090
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:24,715
the way, I don't, 
I'm not standing up.

1091
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:26,817
I don't give a 
fuck about Fiverr.

1092
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:28,302
Fuck Fiverr.

1093
00:46:28,302 --> 00:46:29,887
This isn't about Fiverr.

1094
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:33,523
This is about 
marketplace dynamics.

1095
00:46:33,523 --> 00:46:35,058
This is about capitalism.

1096
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:36,394
This is about who am I as a

1097
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:38,095
human being to 
tell you what to do?

1098
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:39,063
You do you.

1099
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:41,565
You guys have been seeing this
from me more and more lately.

1100
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:43,567
I'm not telling you 
to work 18 hours a day.

1101
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,336
You might get divorced.

1102
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:46,737
Like I don't want that.

1103
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:48,472
I don't want an 
email in 20 years saying,

1104
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,096
"I listened to you.
I made a million bucks

1105
00:46:50,096 --> 00:46:52,076
"but my kids hate you, hate me."

1106
00:46:52,076 --> 00:46:53,563
Like I don't want that.

1107
00:46:53,563 --> 00:46:55,232
I'm telling you what I do.

1108
00:46:55,232 --> 00:46:57,748
You can use it as a context
point and figure out what you

1109
00:46:57,748 --> 00:47:00,251
think but let me 
just say one thing,

1110
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:03,220
hard work always 
is gonna matter.

1111
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,756
I just want to make sure 
that part doesn't get lost.

1112
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,692
I'm sorry but it's true.

1113
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:09,896
Like it's just forever.

1114
00:47:09,896 --> 00:47:12,430
Forever like there is nobody,

1115
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:16,267
there's nobody who 
did it on no hard work.

1116
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:18,069
It just hasn't happened.

1117
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:21,252
Show me, show me.

1118
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:23,304
You know, I made that video
the other day I guess it was a

1119
00:47:23,304 --> 00:47:24,978
DailyVee and it 
opened with BeyoncÃ©,

1120
00:47:24,978 --> 00:47:27,116
people love, 
BeyoncÃ©'s got it so great.

1121
00:47:27,116 --> 00:47:29,017
BeyoncÃ© worked her 
fucking face off since she was,

1122
00:47:29,017 --> 00:47:30,626
her fucking dad made her dance

1123
00:47:30,626 --> 00:47:33,416
since she was four 
every day of her life.

1124
00:47:33,416 --> 00:47:36,286
Like everybody sees 
what it's at when it's good.

1125
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:38,051
You guys see this now.

1126
00:47:38,051 --> 00:47:39,924
I didn't have a 
fuckin' childhood.

1127
00:47:39,924 --> 00:47:42,526
I worked every 
minute from 14 to 30,

1128
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,694
all of them.

1129
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,663
Like, you know and so like

1130
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,598
I think that we have 
to factor in these things.

1131
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:48,299
- Yeah.

1132
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:50,968
I have a question that's come
in from Twitter from one our

1133
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:53,904
bloggers here, from one of
our actual writers Dom Burch.

1134
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:56,474
He recently wrote an 
article about is it time to call

1135
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:58,075
bullshit on 
influencer marketing.

1136
00:47:58,075 --> 00:47:58,743
- Right.

1137
00:47:58,743 --> 00:48:00,044
- He wants to know 
your thoughts on it.

1138
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:00,711
- I think influencer marketing

1139
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,153
is one of the best 
deals in the world.

1140
00:48:03,153 --> 00:48:04,435
- There it is.

1141
00:48:04,435 --> 00:48:07,387
- So I guess, now, 
now, now to that point,

1142
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:08,986
to that point we have to get

1143
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:11,122
into details a lot of 
this is headline reading.

1144
00:48:11,122 --> 00:48:13,958
I think there's a ton of
influencers that are overpaid.

1145
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:17,161
I'm obsessed with the long
tail of influencer marketing.

1146
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:21,465
There are so many people
with 300 to 3,000 followers on

1147
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:24,468
Instagram that will do so much
good for your business you would

1148
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:28,906
not believe and there's people
that have 100,000 followers and

1149
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,876
good engagement too by the way,
it's not just the bought 'em,

1150
00:48:31,876 --> 00:48:34,512
good engagement but they've
pimped every fucking thing under

1151
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:36,680
the sun so the depth of their

1152
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,850
promotion or 
sponsorship is not real.

1153
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,819
I've never pimped 
anything so when I do it,

1154
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:45,222
it would mean something and then
somebody will posts some sort of

1155
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:48,993
fucking waist thing and fucking
tea shit and fucking all that

1156
00:48:48,993 --> 00:48:52,797
shit that you see 24/7 you
know after you see them pimp

1157
00:48:52,797 --> 00:48:55,132
something 98 days in a row
you just might not take their

1158
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:58,235
opinion for as much 
value as somebody else, right?

1159
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:02,039
And so, I think that I'm very
hot on influencer marketing.

1160
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:05,442
I think it's, 
I just attention arbitrage.

1161
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,512
Show me a human being that's got
a big audience in a niche that

1162
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:11,582
I'm trying to reach and she or
he doesn't know how to price the

1163
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:14,852
value of their distribution and
I'll show you a very happy kid

1164
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:18,055
that loves those 
kind of scenarios.

1165
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:19,623
- I've got gentleman second row.

1166
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,159
Been waiting patiently.

1167
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:25,023
- [Man] Hey Gary.
- Hey brother.

1168
00:49:26,601 --> 00:49:29,440
- [Man] '97, '98 I had a 
Frank Zappa quote on the front

1169
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,169
of my master's dissertation 
on the future of publishing.

1170
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:33,871
And I'm gonna tell you 
that Frank Zappa quote and

1171
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:36,440
then I have a question for you.
- Please.

1172
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,943
- The algorithm can tell you a
story but can't tell you the

1173
00:49:38,943 --> 00:49:41,502
whole story, it just 
doesn't have the eyebrows.

1174
00:49:41,502 --> 00:49:42,280
- [Gary] Interesting.

1175
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,549
- Who do you think 
today has the eyebrows?

1176
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:47,885
- I think that's a 
really cool, that's really cool.

1177
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:51,722
So I think the people that have
the eyebrows are the ones that

1178
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:55,392
are not romantic around the
subjectiveness of the art and

1179
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:59,263
realizes there is a process to
create a lot of the art to get

1180
00:49:59,263 --> 00:50:02,299
context on what the 
consumer actually wants.

1181
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:07,004
So what he's referring to I
think and help me here I believe

1182
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,273
that the art of 
marketing, right,

1183
00:50:09,273 --> 00:50:10,875
the creative is the magic.

1184
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:13,944
It's the variable.
It 100% is.

1185
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:15,479
It's not the math, right?

1186
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:19,450
However, I believe that there is
now the opportunity to create a

1187
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:23,487
lot of the art, 
bubble it up at scale,

1188
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:26,870
not be romantic that you're the
only human being that knows

1189
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:30,327
the voice or the brand 
or the right song.

1190
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,379
Put it out and let the audience,

1191
00:50:32,379 --> 00:50:34,164
do you know how 
much more successful,

1192
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:38,502
Drake the artist.

1193
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:41,671
This mother fucker's put out
like 80 songs this year already.

1194
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:42,873
Do you know how smart that is?

1195
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,008
Do you know what he's doing?

1196
00:50:44,008 --> 00:50:45,342
Why it's so smart?

1197
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:48,279
Every artist that we know, 
all those Prince songs,

1198
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:49,780
right, that are in the vault.

1199
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,383
In 2016, Prince would 
have put them all out.

1200
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:55,386
What you're gonna see from all
your artists is if they believe

1201
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:56,350
in it, they're gonna put it out.

1202
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:59,089
They're not gonna be stuck to
the you need 12 songs in the

1203
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:03,661
album or some fucking partner
at Sony music saying what's this

1204
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:06,956
album, what story 
is this album telling?

1205
00:51:06,956 --> 00:51:10,200
I mean so the people that have
the eyebrows that are the ones

1206
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,638
that realize that the art is the
magic but let's cut some of the

1207
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:17,775
bullshit out of the the
human bullshit out of the art.

1208
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:22,212
- Okay, we've not got a lot of
time left so we're gonna take

1209
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:23,013
one more from the floor.

1210
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:24,748
We'll take one more from online.
- Yeah.

1211
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,655
- And then we'll 
finish up. Louise, you choose.

1212
00:51:27,655 --> 00:51:28,652
- I'm feeling good.

1213
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:29,987
I'm willing to be 
10 or 15 minutes late.

1214
00:51:29,987 --> 00:51:32,823
- Okay.
- Yeah, I would do this all day.

1215
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:36,593
- Okay, Louise would you just
happily pass the mic along.

1216
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,315
There we go.
- Oh, new system, the pass.

1217
00:51:39,315 --> 00:51:42,299
I was literally when she's gonna
figure out the pass is the game.

1218
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:43,233
- We're gonna learn.

1219
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:44,868
- [Kevani] Hi Gary.
- That was a good pass.

1220
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:45,736
- [Kevani] My name's Kevani.

1221
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:48,172
I'm 18, I'd left 
secondary school,

1222
00:51:48,172 --> 00:51:50,607
high school 
around 10 months ago.

1223
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:55,045
Since then I've co-founded an
app that basically allows guys

1224
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:56,513
to pre-book any barber

1225
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:59,452
whilst being 
rewarded for their loyalty.

1226
00:51:59,452 --> 00:52:03,554
We are, a majority of our
team is black from the African,

1227
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:04,922
Caribbean community.
- [Gary] Love it.

1228
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:06,457
- Understand you 
grew up in Jersey,

1229
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,162
around the hip hop 
renaissance 80s.

1230
00:52:08,162 --> 00:52:09,059
- [Gary] I did.

1231
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:13,263
- I want to know how you suggest
we represent our culture without

1232
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:15,948
exclusivising ourselves.

1233
00:52:15,948 --> 00:52:17,081
- I want to make sure 
I caught the last part.

1234
00:52:17,081 --> 00:52:18,844
How we represent 
our culture with what?

1235
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:19,954
- Without 
exclusivising ourselves.

1236
00:52:19,954 --> 00:52:22,467
'Cause if you look 
at companies like FUBU.

1237
00:52:22,467 --> 00:52:23,147
- [Gary] Yep.

1238
00:52:23,147 --> 00:52:25,242
- They were very black.
- [Gary] Yes.

1239
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:26,842
- Their consumers 
were very black.

1240
00:52:26,842 --> 00:52:27,447
- [Gary] Yes.

1241
00:52:27,447 --> 00:52:30,494
- But hip hop was used 
to grow brands like Adidas,

1242
00:52:30,494 --> 00:52:33,283
Puma, not really stuff that
belonged to our community.

1243
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:33,951
- [Gary] Yes, yes.

1244
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:35,519
- So how would you 
suggest we do that?

1245
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:38,222
- I think it really comes
down to what you guys and gals,

1246
00:52:38,222 --> 00:52:41,158
I don't know your team but
what do you want to accomplish?

1247
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,360
- We want to revolutionize 
the barber industry.

1248
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,295
We want every barber 
to be booked through our.

1249
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:47,398
- Well then, I think you need
to think about every culture and

1250
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:49,366
every person because 
you're trying to boil the ocean.

1251
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:53,537
So I think there's a 
lot of ways to do that.

1252
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:57,274
Look, I think, and this has
obviously become a little bit

1253
00:52:57,274 --> 00:53:00,110
more of a topic because I've
been doing more stuff in the

1254
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,346
hip hop, you know, 
I did the Breakfast Club and

1255
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:03,380
that got ridiculous.

1256
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,882
And so that brought 
people awareness and

1257
00:53:04,882 --> 00:53:05,582
they're like wait a minute.

1258
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:09,153
And then people scoured my
Instagram and are like why is

1259
00:53:09,153 --> 00:53:10,687
Gary have all these 
college friends that are black?

1260
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:11,992
(audience laughter)
All this stuff.

1261
00:53:11,992 --> 00:53:15,134
So this conversation 
has bubbled up a little bit.

1262
00:53:15,134 --> 00:53:18,489
I truly believe what 
I'm about to say which is,

1263
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:23,166
one, I think entrepreneurship
is rugged and is very raw.

1264
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:26,131
And I actually believe the more
disadvantages you had growing

1265
00:53:26,131 --> 00:53:29,273
up, it's a better 
proxy for success.

1266
00:53:29,273 --> 00:53:32,643
So I've made more money on
female entrepreneur-backed

1267
00:53:32,643 --> 00:53:35,248
companies than any 
thing else I've ever done.

1268
00:53:35,248 --> 00:53:38,440
I just want to win 
so I could care less--

1269
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,213
(audience member applauds)

1270
00:53:40,213 --> 00:53:41,924
You like that one? 
(audience laughter)

1271
00:53:41,924 --> 00:53:44,705
I'll tell you that 
I'm far quicker to not

1272
00:53:44,705 --> 00:53:47,514
want to do business with a 
New England Patriots founder

1273
00:53:47,514 --> 00:53:51,150
than black or a girl or an alien

1274
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:53,493
or anything, you know,
so I think that,

1275
00:53:53,493 --> 00:53:54,825
I think there's 
a couple things about.

1276
00:53:54,825 --> 00:53:59,214
Number one, I think that you
have to bet on strengths which

1277
00:53:59,214 --> 00:54:00,432
is where I'm going.

1278
00:54:00,432 --> 00:54:03,182
So I think one when you're a
minority or when you have the

1279
00:54:03,182 --> 00:54:06,577
fight harder than a white dude,
I think you need the first of

1280
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,036
all channel that chip.

1281
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,759
I think I'm successful and
I think a lot of people are

1282
00:54:09,759 --> 00:54:11,693
successful in 
channeling adversity.

1283
00:54:11,693 --> 00:54:14,920
Number two, if your goal is

1284
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,325
to revolutionize 
the barber industry,

1285
00:54:17,325 --> 00:54:19,042
I think what you 
do is you win on

1286
00:54:19,042 --> 00:54:21,657
your actions and nothing else.

1287
00:54:21,657 --> 00:54:25,049
Meaning just building a
successful business is the best

1288
00:54:25,049 --> 00:54:28,230
thing you can do for the 
question that you just asked

1289
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:31,684
because I think spending any
time or energy on the narrative

1290
00:54:31,684 --> 00:54:33,647
is not going to 
accomplish anything

1291
00:54:33,647 --> 00:54:35,443
in revolutionizing 
the barber industry.

1292
00:54:35,443 --> 00:54:38,254
There's one amazing 
thing about the market,

1293
00:54:38,254 --> 00:54:41,349
the market, the market the one
I love so much based on your

1294
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:44,340
question, the 
one I love so much,

1295
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,693
they don't care who invented it.

1296
00:54:46,693 --> 00:54:48,949
If it's good for 
them they want it.

1297
00:54:48,949 --> 00:54:50,028
They're just real like that.

1298
00:54:50,028 --> 00:54:51,430
That's what I love 
about the market.

1299
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:54,376
The market is the only 
thing that's not prejudice.

1300
00:54:54,376 --> 00:54:58,058
It's the market like they just
want what's good for them and

1301
00:54:58,058 --> 00:54:59,531
they don't care 
who the founder was.

1302
00:54:59,531 --> 00:55:02,542
You don't know who the
founder is of anything you got.

1303
00:55:02,542 --> 00:55:05,036
Like you don't know the 
back story of anything you're

1304
00:55:05,036 --> 00:55:06,370
wearing, using, buying.

1305
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,372
You just want what you want.

1306
00:55:08,372 --> 00:55:10,807
And so, I would tell you the
best thing you could do is

1307
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:13,777
actually just 
build a big business.

1308
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:17,114
And not worry about that
narrative because I think if

1309
00:55:17,114 --> 00:55:20,217
I cared about doing something
right for the Russian Jewish

1310
00:55:20,217 --> 00:55:23,053
immigrant community, being
successful is the best thing

1311
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:24,354
I could've done. Right?

1312
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:26,089
So I would tell you that.

1313
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:29,560
Now on the same token, I'll tell
you them probably gonna leave a

1314
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,729
lot of money on the table in
my life because I much more

1315
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:37,534
passionate about having a legacy
of helping entrepreneurs than

1316
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:40,971
I do in maximizing a couple
hundred more million dollars.

1317
00:55:40,971 --> 00:55:43,674
If you have passion around the
narrative of what you can do,

1318
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,409
rise up others 
in your community,

1319
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:47,711
then you start spending some
of that time and energy on it.

1320
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:51,114
Two things, one, first build the
business 'cause it'll give you

1321
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:52,950
leverage to do 
that later and two,

1322
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,985
once you feel like you got a
foundation where all of you have

1323
00:55:54,985 --> 00:55:57,354
got a little something 
and you're feeling good,

1324
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,322
then you can start trickling

1325
00:55:58,322 --> 00:56:00,524
some of that stuff 
'cause it all takes energy.

1326
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:02,492
It's all opportunity costs.

1327
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:05,662
Like this right here tonight is
at the expense of something else

1328
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:07,898
I could be doing and there's
millions of things I could be

1329
00:56:07,898 --> 00:56:10,567
doing that would be making
me more short-term money.

1330
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,217
There's millions of things 
I could be doing that could

1331
00:56:12,217 --> 00:56:13,971
build my brand bigger.

1332
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:17,933
To me, this market, these guys,

1333
00:56:17,933 --> 00:56:19,343
was the right vibe when we met

1334
00:56:19,343 --> 00:56:21,478
for drinks of the founder.

1335
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:22,946
This community, 
like so you know,

1336
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:25,972
you make your decisions but 
I would tell you I asked you a

1337
00:56:25,972 --> 00:56:27,784
very specific question 
'cause it's the right question.

1338
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:29,753
If you want to 
revolutionize that industry.

1339
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:31,855
That's for everybody and

1340
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:33,590
that needs to be 
what you focus on first.

1341
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:35,792
You can get back to doing the
right thing for your community

1342
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,629
three, four, five, six years
from today not doing anything

1343
00:56:38,629 --> 00:56:41,098
except building the business
'cause you'll use that leverage

1344
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:42,479
to actually do it.

1345
00:56:42,479 --> 00:56:43,986
I have a second 
question for you, sorry.

1346
00:56:43,986 --> 00:56:45,002
- [Gary] Okay.

1347
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:47,170
- At this age you 
were probably quite

1348
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,772
similar minded 
to someone like me.

1349
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:52,109
Quite entrepreneurial, 
trying to set up a business.

1350
00:56:52,109 --> 00:56:53,844
How do you balance the patience

1351
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:55,545
and the 
impatience at this point?

1352
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:56,713
- You know I,

1353
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:59,983
and I'm glad you asked that 
and tall dude referenced it.

1354
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:02,653
One of the best things that
I think I've done for young

1355
00:57:02,653 --> 00:57:06,472
entrepreneurs is tell them
that my addiction is patience.

1356
00:57:06,472 --> 00:57:08,897
How'd I balance it?
'Cause I knew it mattered.

1357
00:57:08,897 --> 00:57:12,585
Like all you kids are fucking
up because you want shit now.

1358
00:57:12,585 --> 00:57:13,430
- Yeah.

1359
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,866
- And you will lose every time.

1360
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:17,567
You lack practicality.

1361
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,402
You want shit now.

1362
00:57:18,402 --> 00:57:20,059
You're 18.

1363
00:57:20,059 --> 00:57:22,706
If you get nothing 
for the next 12 years,

1364
00:57:22,706 --> 00:57:25,609
just fucking eat shit, 
grind, hustle, do it.

1365
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:26,543
Nothing.

1366
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:30,399
You'll be 30.
(audience laughter)

1367
00:57:30,399 --> 00:57:31,360
- [Stephen] And?

1368
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:35,230
- I mean I would 
rip my arm off to be 30.

1369
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:37,507
I'll give you my 
arm for 10 years.

1370
00:57:37,507 --> 00:57:40,624
For 10 years, 
I'll give you my arm.

1371
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,036
- [Adam] Take me back.

1372
00:57:42,036 --> 00:57:45,195
- So, I would tell 
you how did I balance it?

1373
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,097
Because I'm a winning player.

1374
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:49,966
Because I know how to 
build million dollar things.

1375
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:52,576
And million dollar things
don't happen with shortcuts.

1376
00:57:52,576 --> 00:57:54,338
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

1377
00:57:54,338 --> 00:57:55,306
That sounds like a business.

1378
00:57:55,306 --> 00:57:56,436
- Perfect answer.

1379
00:57:56,436 --> 00:57:58,528
Before you put 
the microphone down,

1380
00:57:58,528 --> 00:58:00,143
do you want to be on one of
these shows 'cause you seem

1381
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,245
like an interesting individual
and what you're doing seems

1382
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:04,381
amazing as well.
- Wow.

1383
00:58:04,381 --> 00:58:07,078
- Sweet, we'll talk afterwards. 
(audience applause)

1384
00:58:07,078 --> 00:58:08,839
- Okay.

1385
00:58:08,839 --> 00:58:12,989
- Secondly, you do business
with somebody from outer space

1386
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,292
instead of a 
New England Patriots fan?

1387
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:18,362
- Yeah, I mean there's 
nothing worse on Earth than

1388
00:58:18,362 --> 00:58:21,673
a New England Patriots fan.
(audience laughter)

1389
00:58:21,673 --> 00:58:24,010
- I'm a Dolphins 
fan so it's fine.

1390
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:26,330
(crosstalk)

1391
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:28,020
- Let's keep going 
unless you guys are stuck.

1392
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,378
- Can I come to you 
after going to the internet?

1393
00:58:30,378 --> 00:58:33,009
- Yeah.
- Just dive through.

1394
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,181
We've had loads 
and loads of questions

1395
00:58:34,181 --> 00:58:36,179
coming in since we last got one.

1396
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,881
Somebody asking 
would you rehire them.

1397
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:39,087
I was like I'll 
go past that one.

1398
00:58:39,087 --> 00:58:41,818
- Is that true?

1399
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:43,720
Oh my God, I'm love Jeremy.
- Yes, yes, yes.

1400
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,789
- Jeremy send me an 
email. Send me an email.

1401
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:48,291
That's amazing.
- There we go.

1402
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:49,693
That's fantastic.

1403
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:52,174
Jobs!

1404
00:58:52,174 --> 00:58:52,996
- That's awesome Jeremy.

1405
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:56,933
- We got loads of 
questions, I'm gonna pick,

1406
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:57,953
where do you the e-commerce

1407
00:58:57,953 --> 00:59:00,172
will be heading 
in the next five years

1408
00:59:00,172 --> 00:59:04,241
or what advice would you
give recruiters looking to grow

1409
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:07,244
their social presence 
to engage with candidates?

1410
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:09,646
- I think recruiters 
need to prove to us

1411
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:11,448
what value do they bring.

1412
00:59:11,448 --> 00:59:13,183
And so I think recruiters

1413
00:59:13,183 --> 00:59:15,861
would be very 
smart to put out content.

1414
00:59:15,861 --> 00:59:18,955
And content they 
would normally, so,

1415
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:22,426
the number one advice I have for
people that sell their services

1416
00:59:22,426 --> 00:59:25,195
is to give it away 
for free on the internet.

1417
00:59:25,195 --> 00:59:26,522
Let me explain.

1418
00:59:26,522 --> 00:59:31,448
I give all of you all my best
marketing advice every day.

1419
00:59:31,448 --> 00:59:35,472
I have agency competitors, 
I have other people that take my

1420
00:59:35,472 --> 00:59:37,937
content repackage it,

1421
00:59:37,937 --> 00:59:40,677
market against 
GaryVee fans on Facebook

1422
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:41,845
and sell it back to them for

1423
00:59:41,845 --> 00:59:44,681
$400 e-books and 
my fucking fans buy it.

1424
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:45,949
(audience laughter)

1425
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:50,287
Yeah. You know 
how much that hurts?

1426
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:51,626
But, I don't care.

1427
00:59:51,626 --> 00:59:55,288
It's the right 
strategy and here's why.

1428
00:59:55,288 --> 00:59:57,294
A, and this is 
gonna blow your mind,

1429
00:59:57,294 --> 01:00:01,164
98% of people aren't gonna
do anything about it anyway.

1430
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:02,882
That's the crazy one.

1431
01:00:02,882 --> 01:00:07,070
B, if you keep doing it, if you
keep doing it something innately

1432
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,406
human takes over and 
people start understanding the

1433
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:11,708
difference between the people
that provide value and people

1434
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,319
that are trying to take value.

1435
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:14,658
And I'm winning on that.
- [Adam] Yeah.

1436
01:00:14,658 --> 01:00:17,981
- Because the one thing that
people haven't really figured

1437
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:19,811
out of what I'm actually doing

1438
01:00:19,811 --> 01:00:23,453
is my behavior is one big case

1439
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,365
study in the difference between

1440
01:00:25,365 --> 01:00:28,585
branding and 
marketing versus sales.

1441
01:00:29,387 --> 01:00:31,672
If you look at what I've done
over the last five to seven

1442
01:00:31,672 --> 01:00:33,096
years versus what a lot of

1443
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:35,065
people that look 
like me have done,

1444
01:00:35,065 --> 01:00:38,969
they've tried to 
transact you and monetize you

1445
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,136
and I haven't.

1446
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,173
I've tried to 
build a brand on you.

1447
01:00:43,173 --> 01:00:46,540
And what ends up happening is 
I end up winning that race in

1448
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:48,645
the long term because 
your word of mouth,

1449
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:52,582
your appreciation, your support,
trumps the short term returns

1450
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:53,750
that other people do.

1451
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,853
So if I was a recruiter, 
I'd be putting out advice.

1452
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:58,989
You may think you've got three
little things that you tell a

1453
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:02,325
candidate about your resume,
about something that that's the

1454
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:05,161
secret sauce and 
you've converted well.

1455
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:07,998
That shit needs to go in public
and get shared and then bring

1456
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,200
more people to you, not less.

1457
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,112
Because what people haven't

1458
01:01:12,112 --> 01:01:15,572
understood is advice, 
in general,

1459
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:19,776
the way I'm doing it 
right now, can only be so good.

1460
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:23,113
Right, like that's why I do Q&amp;A
because I can add three or four

1461
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:25,479
more context levers where you
may not agree with me or

1462
01:01:25,479 --> 01:01:27,450
where we need to 
finish the thought and

1463
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,619
we end up being in 
a more similar place,

1464
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:30,854
we're in a 
different place or

1465
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:33,189
something that 
I can round value around.

1466
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:36,526
Every recruiter can give their
best advice but then when they

1467
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:39,329
meet you are gonna listen to
you and have to give me three or

1468
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:41,197
four other data pieces of advice

1469
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,066
that they could never 
do with their content.

1470
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:44,274
But they haven't 
figured that out.

1471
01:01:44,274 --> 01:01:45,869
They think they're 
in the advice business

1472
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:47,070
so why would I give it away?

1473
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:50,179
Back to Fiverr, 
I give everything away.

1474
01:01:50,179 --> 01:01:51,174
Fiverr haters.

1475
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:54,911
You know and so 
that's what I would do.

1476
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:56,546
As far as were
e-commerce is going,

1477
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,248
I think they're gonna 
put malls out of business.

1478
01:01:58,248 --> 01:02:01,047
I'm kidding. Kidding.
(audience laughter)

1479
01:02:01,047 --> 01:02:03,102
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1480
01:02:04,712 --> 01:02:07,490
How many people in e-com or
flirt with it or play with it?

1481
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:08,925
Not a lot of 
people here, a couple?

1482
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:11,027
Yeah, it's true, right.

1483
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:14,798
I couldn't imagine not making
every decision today around

1484
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:18,501
e-com based on a mobile only
environment and

1485
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:21,710
I don't mean iPad, 
I mean your cell phone.

1486
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:24,207
So that would be the 
number one thing I would say.

1487
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:29,273
For you to be in e-com and not
every behavior you're doing is

1488
01:02:29,273 --> 01:02:34,217
okay, 84% of our business is 
desktop and 16 is mobile,

1489
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:37,020
but let's do everything in our
business right now with it being

1490
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,609
about mobile and all the
business we get from desktop is

1491
01:02:39,609 --> 01:02:43,102
gravy until the shift.

1492
01:02:43,102 --> 01:02:44,628
- Do we have 
any recruiters here?

1493
01:02:47,664 --> 01:02:48,331
- Nope.

1494
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:49,332
- 'Cause that's basically all

1495
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:51,334
I get from recruiters 
is stuff like that.

1496
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:52,068
(audience laughter)

1497
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:54,437
And if you just stop 
doing that and listen to you.

1498
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:55,305
- What does it say?

1499
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:57,374
- Oh, it's I'd like to add
you to my network on LinkedIn.

1500
01:02:57,374 --> 01:02:58,742
It's just Batman and Bane.
- Okay.

1501
01:02:58,742 --> 01:03:02,045
- Yeah, I mean look, I mean
spamming people on LinkedIn is

1502
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:04,607
not a marketing strategy.

1503
01:03:04,607 --> 01:03:06,349
- There's so many 
recruiters still do it.

1504
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:07,884
- 'Cause it works.

1505
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:09,285
Because people 
hate their fucking jobs.

1506
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,654
They're like, "Oh, 
hope this guy can help me."

1507
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:13,938
(audience laughter)

1508
01:03:13,938 --> 01:03:16,409
But pay attention 
to what I'm saying

1509
01:03:16,409 --> 01:03:19,129
'cause those were 
two contradictions.

1510
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,997
So that's a recruiter

1511
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:23,933
that's gonna win on 
sales and transactions.

1512
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:27,370
The one that listens to 
my advice wins on brand.

1513
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:31,274
Right, the reason I sell 100,000
copies of my book the first week

1514
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:34,544
and not 1,000 like all the other
people is they're transacting

1515
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:38,098
and I'm marketing.
- Cool. Stephen.

1516
01:03:38,098 --> 01:03:42,592
- Gentleman here.
- That t-shirt is amazing.

1517
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:46,948
But not at the same time.
- I love it.

1518
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:47,680
- [Rafal] Hi.

1519
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,191
Thanks for being here, thanks
for doing what you're doing over

1520
01:03:49,191 --> 01:03:50,806
the last couple of years online.

1521
01:03:50,806 --> 01:03:54,706
I've got three things 
that will try to be very fast.

1522
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:55,354
- [Gary] No problem.

1523
01:03:55,354 --> 01:03:57,569
- First of all my name is Rafal.

1524
01:03:57,569 --> 01:03:58,835
I came to the U.K. 
around 10 years ago.

1525
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,151
I'm from Poland.

1526
01:04:00,151 --> 01:04:01,151
So it's kind of like you,

1527
01:04:01,151 --> 01:04:03,339
I was born in 
Communistic Poland.

1528
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:06,764
- [Gary] Yes.
- In mid-80s.

1529
01:04:06,764 --> 01:04:09,813
For the first five years, I was
doing different kind of day jobs

1530
01:04:09,813 --> 01:04:12,649
here and over the last five
years I do my own business.

1531
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:14,150
I started as a photographer,

1532
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:16,352
then I went into 
video and I'm doing okay.

1533
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:18,555
That's my project 
that supports me,

1534
01:04:18,555 --> 01:04:23,293
my wife and our 
family so that's good.

1535
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:25,095
Over the last year and 
especially the last couple of

1536
01:04:25,095 --> 01:04:29,070
months, I started 
doing much more

1537
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,977
200, 300, 500% more than 
I was doing last year and

1538
01:04:33,977 --> 01:04:35,822
suddenly there was 
no much time to sleep.

1539
01:04:35,822 --> 01:04:38,040
(laughs)

1540
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,849
I've got my passion
which is video and I have

1541
01:04:39,849 --> 01:04:42,263
another source of income
which I'm starting which is in

1542
01:04:42,263 --> 01:04:44,299
financial market and

1543
01:04:44,299 --> 01:04:47,851
that would bring me

1544
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:50,665
much more money 
than my passion.

1545
01:04:50,665 --> 01:04:52,989
How to find a 
balance between--

1546
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:55,959
- Family, passion, income.
- [Rafal] 22 hours of work.

1547
01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:56,626
- Yep.

1548
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:58,628
- [Rafal] Between what I like
to do between what I know would

1549
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:01,364
bring me much more money.
- Yep.

1550
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:05,401
Yeah, it's a great question.
- [Rafal] Keeping it growing.

1551
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,070
- First and foremost it starts

1552
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,838
with you communicating 
with your wife.

1553
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:10,039
First and foremost.

1554
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:12,102
That is the 
most important thing.

1555
01:05:12,102 --> 01:05:13,929
- [Rafal] She's 
on board, she's fine.

1556
01:05:13,929 --> 01:05:16,970
- (laughs) So she's benefiting.

1557
01:05:17,825 --> 01:05:20,416
- But it's super important.

1558
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:23,086
Like, first of all you have to
make sure that you're creating

1559
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:25,221
the environment for 
her to tell you the truth.

1560
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:29,459
Right, because she may be in a
position where sure but maybe

1561
01:05:29,459 --> 01:05:32,562
it'd be nice to have date night
or more time with the kids or,

1562
01:05:32,562 --> 01:05:33,610
and this is 
something that

1563
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:34,564
Lizzie and I go 
through every day.

1564
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:36,733
I'm always trying to 
create more protection.

1565
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:38,701
I did it very 
aggressively this weekend.

1566
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:43,206
Where I'm like, this last six
months has been really like,

1567
01:05:43,206 --> 01:05:46,709
like I'm even scared that I'm
so on this high that I've been

1568
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:48,945
thinking about how 
am I gonna stop this.

1569
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,100
Like 'cause this 
is not sustainable.

1570
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:51,304
I don't even 
want this for myself.

1571
01:05:51,304 --> 01:05:53,449
Like the way 
I'm going right now,

1572
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,910
over the last six months, 
I don't even want it.

1573
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,248
I don't even want it.

1574
01:05:57,248 --> 01:05:59,555
But what's crazy is like 
it's fucking like, right?

1575
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:02,716
Like the high is so 
intense I'm like fuck,

1576
01:06:02,716 --> 01:06:06,611
the coming off that 
high is gonna be hard.

1577
01:06:06,611 --> 01:06:08,681
- [Rafal] I know what you 
mean. Sometimes it's 2 A.M.

1578
01:06:08,681 --> 01:06:11,201
I don't want to go to
sleep but I know I need to.

1579
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:13,236
- So I will say one thing, this
is a good opportunity for me.

1580
01:06:13,236 --> 01:06:14,637
Let's make sure we get this on

1581
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:15,972
my Snapchat 'cause 
I want to get this.

1582
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,274
This is my next 
thing I'm gonna pound.

1583
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:20,877
I'm a huge fan of sleep.

1584
01:06:20,877 --> 01:06:22,212
I'm a big believer in sleep and

1585
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:23,980
I think everybody 
should sleep a lot.

1586
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:24,647
I mean it.

1587
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,016
I'm actually trying to sleep
six or seven hours every day.

1588
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:30,253
It's not happening for me all
the time but I'll sleep 10 hours

1589
01:06:30,253 --> 01:06:32,488
if I can from a 
Friday to a Saturday.

1590
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,090
Sleeps massively important.

1591
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:37,026
I'm more worried what 
you're doing while your awake.

1592
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:37,694
Right?

1593
01:06:37,694 --> 01:06:39,963
I'm worried about people lolly
gagging and bullshitting and

1594
01:06:39,963 --> 01:06:41,464
playing "Candy 
Crush" and fucking,

1595
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:43,032
you know, that.

1596
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:44,667
But sleep I'm all in on.

1597
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,769
I think it's 
communication. Right?

1598
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,338
I think it's balance.

1599
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,807
And I think the other thing that
you guys have to figure out and

1600
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:51,741
it's for everybody.

1601
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:52,909
Everybody has their own thing.

1602
01:06:52,909 --> 01:06:55,445
You can't worry about what other
people's relationships are.

1603
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:58,214
You've got you guys, you've got
your feelings towards what you

1604
01:06:58,214 --> 01:06:59,515
want to do professionally.

1605
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:00,950
Your kids, money.

1606
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:03,887
And you have to understand 
the most important part,

1607
01:07:03,887 --> 01:07:06,723
it changes every day.

1608
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:08,000
There's no rule.

1609
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,792
There's no, 
in those three things,

1610
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:13,196
more money, 
passion, family, right?

1611
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:14,697
33, 33, 33.

1612
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,170
Tomorrow 40, 7,

1613
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:20,132
like, you can't figure this out.

1614
01:07:20,132 --> 01:07:23,106
This is, there is no
work-life balance.

1615
01:07:23,106 --> 01:07:25,441
There is no
happiness-money balance.

1616
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:28,378
There's all of us just 
trying to do the best we can.

1617
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:31,514
What won for me and what I'm
trying to push harder and try to

1618
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:32,482
figure out how to communicate

1619
01:07:32,482 --> 01:07:37,453
this to you is do 
you know yourself.

1620
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:38,655
That's when you start winning.

1621
01:07:38,655 --> 01:07:43,226
I know who I am and then that's
why I'm able to do what I do

1622
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:46,863
because I'm always picking the
thing that makes me the happiest

1623
01:07:46,863 --> 01:07:49,149
and then I'm just making sure
that everybody around me

1624
01:07:49,149 --> 01:07:51,330
that's affected by that,

1625
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:54,210
where do they sit 
on that pendulum of

1626
01:07:54,210 --> 01:07:55,605
being okay with it.

1627
01:07:55,605 --> 01:07:58,207
Because if I'm not 
doing what's best for me,

1628
01:07:58,207 --> 01:08:00,507
well then I can't support
everything else and,

1629
01:08:00,507 --> 01:08:03,446
as you can imagine in my life, 
I support a lot of things.

1630
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:05,982
And so I'm, 
you know, it's just constant,

1631
01:08:05,982 --> 01:08:08,851
it's a living and 
breathing thing and

1632
01:08:08,851 --> 01:08:10,420
it will never be solved.

1633
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:13,423
It just once you make that
decision and you realize it can

1634
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:16,899
ebb and flow and you have to
know how to concede at times,

1635
01:08:16,899 --> 01:08:19,495
you have to patient.
You know?

1636
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:22,332
I love calling patience but
then I'm in my own like momentum

1637
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:25,167
moment I'm like okay to be
patient and so you just fight

1638
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,203
but there's, I'm not gonna be
able to answer that for you.

1639
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:28,871
Nobody is.

1640
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:30,238
You gotta 
answer it for yourself.

1641
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:33,209
And I would say the other thing
is every time you're not feeling

1642
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:35,478
good, tweak the numbers.

1643
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:37,814
Every time, that's what I do.

1644
01:08:37,814 --> 01:08:40,850
You haven't heard from me maybe
ever for the people that watch

1645
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,464
me hard-core saying

1646
01:08:42,464 --> 01:08:44,854
I don't want to go at this pace.

1647
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:46,456
It's because in the 
last week or two I'm like

1648
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:48,124
I don't want to go at this pace.

1649
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:52,095
Like 20 hours, I need to figure
out like this fall I'd really

1650
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:54,263
like to pick one day a week
where I go home at 6 o'clock

1651
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:55,665
just stay home.

1652
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:58,067
Like I'm really 
trying to figure it out.

1653
01:08:58,067 --> 01:08:59,202
We'll see.
- [Rafal] I agree.

1654
01:08:59,202 --> 01:09:03,054
It is a choice and we try to
have at least once a week date

1655
01:09:03,054 --> 01:09:04,818
night and stuff like that to
make sure that's happening.

1656
01:09:04,818 --> 01:09:06,207
- [Gary] That's huge.

1657
01:09:06,207 --> 01:09:08,944
By the way, by the way.
- [Stephen] Hold him to it.

1658
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:09,912
- And by the way,

1659
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:12,314
I've gone months 
without having that with Lizzie.

1660
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,250
- [Rafal] We're trying. Not 
every time we made it happen.

1661
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,305
- It is what it is. 
It is what it is.

1662
01:09:16,305 --> 01:09:18,586
- And another one, quick one.

1663
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:20,723
- [Stephen] Double bubble.
- Very quick.

1664
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:25,161
I would like to be and do what 
I can to help you if you need me

1665
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:28,798
to be your DRock in 
the U.K. or in Europe.

1666
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:29,465
- [Gary] Okay.

1667
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:32,502
- I do video, 
yeah, and I can do it.

1668
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:33,169
- [Gary] Great.

1669
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,090
- I'm more than.

1670
01:09:34,090 --> 01:09:35,805
- [Gary] Gary@VaynerMedia.com
say you're the guy with the

1671
01:09:35,805 --> 01:09:39,075
"Ideas Are Shit" shirt and I'll
get you connected with DRock and

1672
01:09:39,075 --> 01:09:40,219
we'll figure it out.
- [Rafal] Okay.

1673
01:09:40,219 --> 01:09:41,673
Let's speak.

1674
01:09:41,673 --> 01:09:44,040
- So I'm well aware that our
three bosses have been standing

1675
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,042
for an hour and 
15 minutes to make sure

1676
01:09:46,042 --> 01:09:48,251
everyone else got seats.
Thank you bosses.

1677
01:09:48,251 --> 01:09:50,486
- Thank you bosses.
- Thank you bosses.

1678
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:51,319
- Stay standing.

1679
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:54,424
- So we are going to 
close with one final question.

1680
01:09:54,424 --> 01:09:56,592
- Okay.
- What's next for you?

1681
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:58,861
(audience laughter) 
Other than sleep?

1682
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,830
Other than sleep, what's 
next for Gary Vaynerchuk?

1683
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:03,199
- I'm a counterpuncher.

1684
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:06,035
I'm a counterpuncher and when
you're a counterpuncher you have

1685
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,438
no fucking idea 
what's coming at you.

1686
01:10:08,438 --> 01:10:09,743
You know?
And that's who I am

1687
01:10:09,743 --> 01:10:12,442
and so what will be 
next is what's always

1688
01:10:12,442 --> 01:10:15,445
been which is I'm really good

1689
01:10:15,445 --> 01:10:19,482
at understanding white 
spaces in consumer behavior.

1690
01:10:19,482 --> 01:10:21,451
The stuff that you 
guys are not thinking about,

1691
01:10:21,451 --> 01:10:24,620
don't realize or don't realize
you're gonna do and I like to

1692
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,456
pay attention to 
that human behavior.

1693
01:10:26,456 --> 01:10:28,458
I like to figure out how to
story tell whatever I want to

1694
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:30,493
tell in that platform and

1695
01:10:30,493 --> 01:10:33,529
then I become a 
practitioner when I see it.

1696
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:35,698
And then I test and 
learn, I test and learn.

1697
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:38,568
The stuff I'm learning about
Musical.ly right now may work

1698
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:41,838
for me if Musical.ly becomes the
next Snapchat or may work for me

1699
01:10:41,838 --> 01:10:45,208
in three years when something
similar-ish to it and the things

1700
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:47,009
I learned from 
Musical.ly in the way that

1701
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:48,745
I learned a lot from SocialCam.

1702
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:51,347
You remember that 
five minutes? You know?

1703
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:54,550
That app was very hot for
literally five minutes but it

1704
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:57,080
became the foundation of what
Snapchat and Instagram video and

1705
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,388
Vine and I learned.

1706
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:00,511
And so,

1707
01:11:00,511 --> 01:11:04,393
what's next is enormous
amounts of listening while

1708
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:07,897
everybody thinks all 
I'm doing is talking.

1709
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:10,166
- Well, we've all been listening
and it's been fascinating.

1710
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:13,503
Before we finish just would like
to say a quick congratulations.

1711
01:11:13,503 --> 01:11:15,104
Adam's just been 
promoted this month

1712
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,305
to Head of Social for The Drum.

1713
01:11:16,305 --> 01:11:17,899
Well done him.

1714
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:18,908
(audience applause 
and cheers)

1715
01:11:18,908 --> 01:11:20,643
Well deserved. 
- Thank you.

1716
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:22,411
You shouldn't have.
Oh you.

1717
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:24,713
- I'll let you finish up.
- Yeah.

1718
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:26,382
Because this was 
a live recording,

1719
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:28,551
I'm gonna finish it 
off like it is a TV show.

1720
01:11:28,551 --> 01:11:31,295
- You got it.

1721
01:11:31,295 --> 01:11:33,589
- Shit! What do I do?
(audience laughter)

1722
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:35,324
Thank you very much 
for Gary Vaynerchuk.

1723
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:36,025
- Thank you.

1724
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:37,033
- Thank you for 
coming along and

1725
01:11:37,033 --> 01:11:38,194
Stephen Lepitak, my guest.

1726
01:11:38,194 --> 01:11:40,763
- Oh thank you.
- Take that.

1727
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:44,054
This has been another edition,
a special one of SM Buzz Chat.

1728
01:11:44,054 --> 01:11:48,673
- Let's be honest, the best. 
(audience laughter)

1729
01:11:48,673 --> 01:11:52,180
- This has been the second
best edition of SM Buzz Chat.

1730
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:53,142
- Can I ask a quick question?

1731
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,678
You were recently 
interviewed by Larry King,

1732
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:58,181
what was a better 
experience this or Larry King?

1733
01:11:58,181 --> 01:11:59,715
- This was better.
- Yeah.

1734
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:01,638
(audience applause)

1735
01:12:01,638 --> 01:12:04,187
- Because there 
was humans in here.

1736
01:12:04,187 --> 01:12:06,355
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1737
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:09,692
Who, what did you 
think was the best one?

1738
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:10,744
- No, you are the best one.

1739
01:12:10,744 --> 01:12:12,028
It's fine.
- Okay.

1740
01:12:12,028 --> 01:12:13,212
- It's fine.
It's fine.

1741
01:12:13,212 --> 01:12:14,594
Ooh, fuck. Jesus.

1742
01:12:14,594 --> 01:12:15,464
- Right, close up, close up.

1743
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:17,800
- So, thank you very much for
Gary Vaynerchuk joining me for

1744
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,136
the best SM Buzz 
Chat we've ever had.

1745
01:12:20,136 --> 01:12:21,410
Wink.

1746
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:24,340
We'll be back, we have 
another episode very soon.

1747
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,999
- Not as good as this one.
- What? Won't be as good--

1748
01:12:27,999 --> 01:12:29,453
- This is not just the best,

1749
01:12:29,453 --> 01:12:31,079
this is the best 
one you'll ever have.

1750
01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:31,942
(audience laughter)

1751
01:12:31,942 --> 01:12:33,608
- It's the worst 
ending to one ever.

1752
01:12:33,608 --> 01:12:34,797
- Should we do it again?
- No, keep it.

1753
01:12:34,797 --> 01:12:36,586
- Thank you very much for 
Gary Vaynerchuk for joining me

1754
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:39,322
this has been the best episode
and is the last episode we're

1755
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:41,740
gonna do 'cause it's 
never gonna get any better.

1756
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:42,610
- Never gonna get better.

1757
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:43,984
- Bye everyone.
- But if you liked this we

1758
01:12:43,984 --> 01:12:45,595
could probably 
start doing stuff again.

1759
01:12:45,595 --> 01:12:49,732
Follow us @TheDrum, 
@BuzzAwards on Twitter.

1760
01:12:49,732 --> 01:12:53,522
I've been Adam Libonatti-Roche, 
@baconchin,

1761
01:12:53,522 --> 01:12:54,937
go on explain.

1762
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:57,106
Say who you are on Twitter
or Snapchat or Instagram and

1763
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:59,408
Pinterest and Vine.
- Don't need it.

1764
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:02,164
(audience laughter)

1765
01:13:02,164 --> 01:13:04,589
- I don't need it either.

1766
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:05,835
- Thank you to our 
live studio audience.

1767
01:13:05,835 --> 01:13:07,462
- Thank you guys.
- And it's been lovely.

1768
01:13:07,462 --> 00:00:00,000
(audience applause)
