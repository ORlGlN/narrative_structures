1
00:00:00,795 --> 00:00:01,890
- Morning vlog.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,473
(hip hop beat)

3
00:00:08,871 --> 00:00:12,450
Last night I was recruiting
a guy for VaynerSports

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,273
so I had to set an alarm
'cause I was in an event

5
00:00:14,273 --> 00:00:17,424
in Chattanooga and then I didn't realize

6
00:00:17,424 --> 00:00:19,192
it was still on PM so I set my alarm.

7
00:00:19,192 --> 00:00:22,349
So this morning I woke up just randomly.

8
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:25,709
I actually think it was a
skip in my sound machine

9
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:28,488
from a call potentially that I like,

10
00:00:28,488 --> 00:00:31,081
woke up and I looked at my phone,

11
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:33,568
I knew I was in trouble
'cause the alarm didn't go off

12
00:00:33,568 --> 00:00:35,339
- Yeah.
and I grabbed my phone

13
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:39,006
and it was 5:09 and I
have a 6:00 AM flight.

14
00:00:40,938 --> 00:00:43,855
And I made it, Chattanooga Airport.

15
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:46,348
Perfect.
- Did you have to

16
00:00:46,348 --> 00:00:47,642
like cruise through or was it pretty...

17
00:00:47,642 --> 00:00:48,475
- You know what's crazy?

18
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:50,975
I was in the car by like 5:15.

19
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:54,112
- Yep.
And it's 15 minutes, 5:30

20
00:00:54,112 --> 00:00:56,422
and I was like, okay I can
get through it in four minutes

21
00:00:56,422 --> 00:00:57,901
and I'll be good 'cause
as long as you're there

22
00:00:57,901 --> 00:00:58,876
10 minutes before...

23
00:00:58,876 --> 00:00:59,769
- [Man] Uh-huh.

24
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:02,044
- I got there and the line was massive

25
00:01:02,044 --> 00:01:03,665
and like literally four people were like

26
00:01:03,665 --> 00:01:04,819
this is the longest I've ever seen it

27
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,503
in the history of the Chattanooga Airport.

28
00:01:06,503 --> 00:01:07,461
And I was like.

29
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:08,433
So I cut people.

30
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:09,384
It was very nice of people.

31
00:01:09,384 --> 00:01:11,949
I was like, please, and
still it took forever

32
00:01:11,949 --> 00:01:15,214
but then I got there and it was like 5:50

33
00:01:15,214 --> 00:01:17,658
and they still hadn't boarded the plane.

34
00:01:17,658 --> 00:01:19,173
It was good.
- Good stuff.

35
00:01:19,173 --> 00:01:20,551
We made it!

36
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:21,621
Alex?

37
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:23,877
How do we... We may need to
create a separate situation

38
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:25,680
where it's hotter.

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,764
I don't know what to do, maybe in here,

40
00:01:27,764 --> 00:01:29,604
you know, something to think about.

41
00:01:29,604 --> 00:01:31,271
Can you investigate?

42
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:34,289
(inaudible)

43
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:35,122
Yeah.

44
00:01:35,122 --> 00:01:36,064
- You sat that up?

45
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:39,072
- Yeah, I'm also potentionally
getting sick, so...

46
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,296
(fake sneezes)

47
00:01:40,296 --> 00:01:41,129
I'm kidding, of course.

48
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:41,962
It's all mental.

49
00:01:41,962 --> 00:01:43,192
By the way, I was 100%...

50
00:01:43,192 --> 00:01:44,509
I should be super sick right now.

51
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:46,866
My mental break through, I haven't slept.

52
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:48,228
I've slept like six hours in two days.

53
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:50,686
I'm a mess right now.

54
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:52,957
I woke up and like should have been dead.

55
00:01:52,957 --> 00:01:54,319
I can't even believe how I feel right now.

56
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,322
The brain is so underrated Marcus.

57
00:01:56,322 --> 00:01:57,442
- There's also something around,

58
00:01:57,442 --> 00:01:59,877
like a lot of corporations
are moving to like this

59
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:02,541
entrepreneur type of like mentality.

60
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,283
Like, trying to get there
teams to think more small

61
00:02:04,283 --> 00:02:07,125
and start products on their own,

62
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,466
so I think there would be
value in like meeting...

63
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:11,742
- [Man] Almost like org
structured meetings.

64
00:02:11,742 --> 00:02:12,978
- Yes, exactly.

65
00:02:12,978 --> 00:02:16,407
- I want to make a video
rant today about this

66
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:20,119
entrepreneur subject and I
want it to start with Kim

67
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:22,556
just saying that naturally
and I'm going to Segway into

68
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:24,408
my rant I've been wanting
to talk about this

69
00:02:24,408 --> 00:02:26,202
and that will be cool and it's just time.

70
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:28,188
Because I'll just make my
rant right now which is

71
00:02:28,188 --> 00:02:30,833
there is no fucking
entrepreneurs in these companies.

72
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,308
They don't create the framework

73
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:34,381
- Right
for an entrepreneur.

74
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:36,652
It's like being a CFO at VaynerMedia.

75
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:38,320
(laughter)

76
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,217
There's no framework for it.

77
00:02:40,217 --> 00:02:41,050
Like...
- Yeah.

78
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:41,883
It sucks.

79
00:02:41,883 --> 00:02:43,144
They're like be an entrepreneur
but then all your bonuses

80
00:02:43,144 --> 00:02:45,154
are provocative on the internal MMM,

81
00:02:45,154 --> 00:02:48,389
and hitting the $4 CPM on programmatic.

82
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:49,535
Anyway, cool.

83
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:51,868
(rap music)

84
00:02:58,406 --> 00:03:02,602
- Episode 262, Ryan Holiday,
you guys were talking about

85
00:03:02,602 --> 00:03:06,054
marketing, talking about all
that stuff in my new apartment,

86
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:09,162
painting my new apartment
and you said something about

87
00:03:09,162 --> 00:03:12,509
documenting versus creating.
- Creating.

88
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:14,243
That was like bam!

89
00:03:14,243 --> 00:03:15,679
I was like, this guys onto something.

90
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:19,313
So on confidence, just as an
encouragement to when you talk,

91
00:03:19,313 --> 00:03:21,686
like how people react, and
what they listen and what they

92
00:03:21,686 --> 00:03:25,045
do about it, I was like,
I'm going to work there

93
00:03:25,045 --> 00:03:28,661
for whatever time is going to
be, I'm going to work there.

94
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:30,386
And that was August 10th.

95
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:34,550
August 22nd, I was on
the phone with Cecilla.

96
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,841
It was one of those things, I was like...

97
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:36,876
- Good for you, brother.

98
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:37,709
(inaudible)

99
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,886
- If this guys talking about
lets do something about it,

100
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,305
let's really do something about it.

101
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,179
So you know, encouragement
to you that people

102
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:44,438
- Thank you.
are listening.

103
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:46,642
The other thing I wanted
to talk about is parenting.

104
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:47,556
- Yes.

105
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:49,553
- I think I am onto
something when it comes to

106
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:50,971
dads and fitness.

107
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:51,936
- Interesting.

108
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,314
- I have an idea that I
want to start pretty soon.

109
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:57,169
From you perspective, I
know the tools that I need,

110
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:58,949
I know the information
that I want to put it out,

111
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:03,283
how do you choose the
best platform to start,

112
00:04:03,283 --> 00:04:05,345
because obviously...
- Can you do a podcast?

113
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,259
- That's funny you say that.

114
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:07,097
Yes, I can.

115
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:08,636
- The answer is 100% that.

116
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:09,763
- That's funny.

117
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:11,078
I'm going to write it down in big letters.

118
00:04:11,078 --> 00:04:13,188
Yeah, it's funny that
you said that because...

119
00:04:13,188 --> 00:04:14,525
- There's noting else to say, brother.

120
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:15,498
- Yeah, I'm going...

121
00:04:15,498 --> 00:04:16,406
- Can I tell you why?

122
00:04:16,406 --> 00:04:17,238
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

123
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:18,964
- It's passive consumption.
- Yeah.

124
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:19,876
- And it's still...

125
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:22,870
Do you know how I think of all
this stuff, like Real Estate.

126
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,789
- Sure.

127
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:27,551
- Podcast is on the third
street off the beach right now.

128
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:28,586
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

129
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:32,386
- Social media is on the other
side, like 29 streets in.

130
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:33,219
- Yeah, yeah.

131
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:34,291
- Right?
- Yep, yep, yep.

132
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:37,884
- And AR or Crypto are
on the beach right now.

133
00:04:37,884 --> 00:04:38,717
Do you understand?

134
00:04:38,717 --> 00:04:39,550
- Yeah.

135
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,342
- I like the third
because the problem with

136
00:04:41,342 --> 00:04:44,256
being on the beach is you're
pumped when it's Malibu

137
00:04:44,256 --> 00:04:47,775
but you lose a fuck load
of money when it's Smalibu.

138
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:48,608
Got it?

139
00:04:48,608 --> 00:04:49,441
- Yeah.

140
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:50,406
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

141
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:51,239
- Podcasting.

142
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:52,072
- Yeah.

143
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:52,905
It was great meeting you, man.

144
00:04:52,905 --> 00:04:53,738
- Such a pleasure.

145
00:04:53,738 --> 00:04:58,198
Vlog, I'm going to do
something fun right now.

146
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,654
You can get in here, Justin.

147
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:00,487
To vlog...

148
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,382
Leave a comment and say I want the book

149
00:05:07,382 --> 00:05:09,761
and you will get one of the proof copies.

150
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:13,540
I'm going to put it here until
we send it and that's that.

151
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,986
Get out.

152
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:17,319
(rap music)

153
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:29,881
Quick take, I'm going to
leave my quick opinions

154
00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:31,365
on things on the vlog right now.

155
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,240
Just coming through "The
Wire", Facebook adds a

156
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,981
snooze button which lets you,
I guess, snooze people out.

157
00:05:36,981 --> 00:05:39,559
Facebook adds a snooze but
for muting people, groups,

158
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:40,921
and pages for 30 days.

159
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:42,856
Today's launch is a new feature designed

160
00:05:42,856 --> 00:05:44,279
to give users more control.

161
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,323
I've been saying it forever,
everyone's like Facebook

162
00:05:46,323 --> 00:05:48,756
makes me do this, Facebook
screws me, dah, dah,

163
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:51,980
Facebook's only value is your
attention and they will always

164
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,761
make the best product for
you and they will continue

165
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:55,982
to do things for you,

166
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:58,307
for you to stay inside of
Facebook and Instagram.

167
00:05:58,307 --> 00:06:02,020
Your attention is Facebook's
product that they sell.

168
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,097
They're very smart, and
don't take it for granted

169
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:08,353
and actually give a shit
about you from a macro

170
00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:10,828
because it's in it for
them and that's why that

171
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,286
product will continue to be awesome.

172
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:14,834
Facebook and Amazon do things for you

173
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,067
that are then for them.

174
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:18,999
That's kind of the way I
think about it, nonetheless,

175
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:21,980
a very interesting feature
that once again proves

176
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,738
it's for Facebook to do
the things that you want

177
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:29,894
and that's how they'll win
and that is the always,

178
00:06:29,894 --> 00:06:31,901
that is always the best strategy,

179
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:34,680
which is be consumer centric
and you will have the leverage.

180
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,210
Good job, Facebook.

181
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,491
Another little micro headline,
little feature that may not

182
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:43,658
be understood in the macro,
which is do it for the consumer

183
00:06:44,622 --> 00:06:49,266
and the consumer's
admiration, spend attention,

184
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:51,607
will give you the leverage for what

185
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:54,769
you're trying to accomplish.

186
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:56,948
You want some real advice, like real?

187
00:06:56,948 --> 00:06:57,939
- [Man] Yeah.

188
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:01,058
- If you guys understood that
you could accomplish nothing

189
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:02,462
for the next eight years and I mean zero,

190
00:07:02,462 --> 00:07:06,124
and still be young as fuck
and like dominate life,

191
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:08,518
you would get on a plane
and spend the next two years

192
00:07:08,518 --> 00:07:11,043
going everywhere because
there's no downside

193
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:12,699
and there's nothing but upside.

194
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,912
- [Man] Yep.

195
00:07:13,912 --> 00:07:15,069
So do it.

196
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:19,343
- Yeah, I mean, everybody's
playing there 20's backwards.

197
00:07:19,343 --> 00:07:21,844
Everybody's got such a chip
on their shoulder between

198
00:07:21,844 --> 00:07:24,988
debt or to prove to somebody
that they've got something,

199
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:27,931
that they go right into
dumb shit to start getting

200
00:07:27,931 --> 00:07:32,473
short money and like do the
right thing or prove something,

201
00:07:32,473 --> 00:07:33,369
they need to punt...

202
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,347
Everybody should fucking...

203
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:37,597
The 22 to 30 year old play,

204
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:42,345
should be even more
ridiculous than the 18 to 22.

205
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:44,206
And one day, I think it will be.

206
00:07:44,206 --> 00:07:46,427
I think 22 to 30 is going
to get real fucking fun.

207
00:07:46,427 --> 00:07:48,070
I'm pissed that I'm going to miss it.

208
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,131
I think you people should fucking punt it.

209
00:07:50,131 --> 00:07:52,614
I think you guys should
fucking go around the world

210
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:56,421
as a horde, live in shitty
places, like learn, taste,

211
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:58,904
- Yeah, absolutely.
play 100%.

212
00:07:58,904 --> 00:08:00,380
- I just wanted to show
you something really cool.

213
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,349
Do you like magic?

214
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:03,556
- Yeah, I mean, I've been
getting magicked on like by all

215
00:08:03,556 --> 00:08:05,262
these Instagram and YouTube...

216
00:08:05,262 --> 00:08:06,278
You know what's funny?

217
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,428
You know what's funny?

218
00:08:07,428 --> 00:08:08,902
I really like magic.

219
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:11,308
I now really understand what
the fuck people are doing.

220
00:08:11,308 --> 00:08:13,130
It's actually what I do, which is...

221
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,646
What I like about magic is
it's manipulation of attention.

222
00:08:17,646 --> 00:08:19,205
Like, I did not know how you...

223
00:08:19,205 --> 00:08:20,916
What you're about to do,

224
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,801
I did not know how you did it a year ago.

225
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:25,679
I know exactly what you're about to do.

226
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:28,656
And now what's happening,
when people do magic on me,

227
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:30,813
I'm looking at nothing that
they want me to look at

228
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:33,785
and I'm trying to guess
what they're actually doing

229
00:08:33,785 --> 00:08:35,571
and the last time dude did magic on me,

230
00:08:35,572 --> 00:08:36,825
that's like this big Instagrammer,

231
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:38,591
it was shit for me because I could see

232
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:39,624
everything he was doing,

233
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:42,615
though a year ago I would
have been like what the fuck.

234
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:43,448
(laughter)

235
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:44,502
- [Man] Who was the one doing magic?

236
00:08:44,502 --> 00:08:45,335
- I don't know.

237
00:08:45,335 --> 00:08:46,168
- [Justin] The crazy as fuck...

238
00:08:46,168 --> 00:08:47,608
The first guy, you're talking about?

239
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:49,116
- Not Juliene.

240
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:50,762
I mean, David Blaine's a
good friend of mine, right?

241
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:51,595
- [Man] Uh-huh.

242
00:08:51,595 --> 00:08:53,278
- And so, like, that shit was like...

243
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:54,981
When I didn't know what
the magicians were doing

244
00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:58,755
and he's so good, it was
like, fuck me, right?

245
00:08:58,755 --> 00:08:59,588
- [Man] Right.

246
00:08:59,588 --> 00:09:00,421
- But now I actually...

247
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:02,210
I'm actually going to get
drinks with him soon because

248
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,398
now I'm excited to see how
good he is with his craft.

249
00:09:04,398 --> 00:09:07,626
It's so crazy, you're
probably the first guys that's

250
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:10,085
tried to do this to me since
I've completely cemented.

251
00:09:10,085 --> 00:09:11,702
The last time dude did magic on me...

252
00:09:11,702 --> 00:09:12,535
(mumble)

253
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:13,681
Oh, at the soccer thing.

254
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:15,250
- [Justin] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

255
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,470
It was the craziest thing, now.

256
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,974
This guy is really considered
good because I looked into it

257
00:09:19,974 --> 00:09:24,486
and I could see what he was
doing and it's interesting

258
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:26,865
because it's what I
think I do as a person.

259
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:29,765
I live my life the way magicians
run their world, which is,

260
00:09:29,765 --> 00:09:32,980
it seems like I'm doing something to you

261
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,227
but I'm doing something
else and I'm trying to teach

262
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:38,256
everybody that's what I'm doing,
so you guys can do it too.

263
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:39,209
Wish you could see the...

264
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:40,170
I'm getting goosebumps right now.

265
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,083
The last time, the time
before that, it clicked.

266
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,666
So when he came, dude in London

267
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:49,187
or where was I, Amsterdam?

268
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:50,847
Sweden.
- Sweden, yeah.

269
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,101
- I was like ready and the
reason I'm telling you is

270
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:54,510
now I'm so ready.

271
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,746
It was crazy.

272
00:09:55,746 --> 00:09:59,000
I could have really blew up
dude's spot and I held off

273
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,086
because I'm like, I wanted
to respect the game.

274
00:10:01,086 --> 00:10:03,289
Now it's going to be a funny game,

275
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:05,170
when magicians try to do shit to me,

276
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,854
of how fast and good are they
at that thing because I'm not

277
00:10:09,854 --> 00:10:13,971
looking at the thing that they
want me to look at anymore.

278
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:14,804
- [Magician] You ready?

279
00:10:14,804 --> 00:10:15,637
- I'm ready.

280
00:10:15,637 --> 00:10:16,470
- Okay let's do it.

281
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,335
- With all that said.

282
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:20,401
- [Justin] All right, no pressure.

283
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:21,234
- It's fine.

284
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:22,223
We're just going to have fun.

285
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:24,019
- He's one of the top
guys at the magic castle.

286
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:25,042
- I believe you.

287
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,231
I just really wanted to tell him that

288
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:29,111
because it blew my mind.

289
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:30,249
It's interesting, right?

290
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:31,579
It's an interesting way
to articulate it, right?

291
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:32,539
- [Magician] It's true.

292
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:34,688
- It was really interesting
and now I'm, like, into it.

293
00:10:34,688 --> 00:10:35,521
All right, go ahead.

294
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:36,354
- So am I.

295
00:10:36,354 --> 00:10:37,187
I love it.

296
00:10:37,187 --> 00:10:38,457
(laughter)

297
00:10:38,457 --> 00:10:39,903
All right, deck of cards.

298
00:10:39,903 --> 00:10:40,736
- Yes.

299
00:10:42,315 --> 00:10:44,756
- YOu're going to stop
me at any card you like

300
00:10:44,756 --> 00:10:45,589
- I understand.
and whatever card you say

301
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:47,046
stop at, is the card you take.

302
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,319
Okay, go for it.

303
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:49,152
- Stop.

304
00:10:49,152 --> 00:10:49,985
- Yeah, good.

305
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:51,645
We're going to put that card,
let's put it right there.

306
00:10:51,645 --> 00:10:52,965
You're not going to look at it,
I'm not going to look at it.

307
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:55,041
We're going to put this
bottle right on top of it.

308
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,799
All right, my job is to find every card

309
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,354
that's related to that card.

310
00:10:58,354 --> 00:11:00,156
- Okay.
For example, if you had like

311
00:11:00,156 --> 00:11:02,090
a three of diamonds, three
of hearts, clubs, and spades

312
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,489
is my job to get out without
you knowing the card.

313
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:06,155
- Okay.

314
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:07,955
- This is what we're going to do.

315
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:08,872
Let's do...

316
00:11:10,363 --> 00:11:13,066
(mumbles)

317
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:14,913
I don't think any of those are your card.

318
00:11:14,913 --> 00:11:18,455
Actually, the first one that
comes to the top, like that.

319
00:11:18,455 --> 00:11:19,288
You see that?

320
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:21,286
And I know you saw that,
it kind of popped up.

321
00:11:21,286 --> 00:11:22,119
- Mm-hmm.

322
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:23,407
- The ace of hearts which is interesting.

323
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:24,466
We'll put that down right there.

324
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:25,299
Can you hold your hands out

325
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:27,513
because the magics going to
happen in your hands right here.

326
00:11:27,513 --> 00:11:29,180
And to go like that.

327
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:32,276
Right there.

328
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,109
Now let's take a look.

329
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:40,404
The next card goes on top.

330
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:43,396
Now, take a look at it.

331
00:11:43,396 --> 00:11:44,495
Is that another ace?

332
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,328
- It sure is.

333
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:47,330
- Okay, so it's not that one.

334
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,206
It's...

335
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:49,514
What was the first one,
was it a heart or the...

336
00:11:49,514 --> 00:11:50,347
- A heart.

337
00:11:50,347 --> 00:11:51,180
- It was the heart.

338
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,087
Okay, we'll put that one down there.

339
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,339
Hold you hands out.

340
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,833
Okay, we'll go, one, two, three.

341
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:57,666
Let's see.

342
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,106
So, now I have to kind of
look and assess the situation,

343
00:12:00,106 --> 00:12:01,015
see what I've got here.

344
00:12:01,015 --> 00:12:02,594
We'll just give it a
few shuffles, like that.

345
00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:04,069
Remember how you said
stop at the beginning?

346
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,902
- Yeah.

347
00:12:04,902 --> 00:12:06,757
- You're going to say stop
again whenever you like.

348
00:12:06,757 --> 00:12:07,590
- Stop.

349
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,423
- Right there.

350
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:09,256
Take a look.

351
00:12:09,256 --> 00:12:10,605
That card right there, the ace of clubs.

352
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:11,438
- I love it.

353
00:12:11,438 --> 00:12:12,340
- You're the magician, not me.

354
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,430
- What's interesting is, first of all,

355
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,398
90% of what's happened so
far, I have no fucking idea.

356
00:12:17,398 --> 00:12:18,814
That one I understood.

357
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:19,647
- Huh.

358
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:21,289
- I never would have before.

359
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:23,684
Because I was looking at
something, it's super cool.

360
00:12:23,684 --> 00:12:25,005
It's super cool.

361
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:26,516
It actually...

362
00:12:26,516 --> 00:12:27,573
You'll find this interesting.

363
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:29,838
I actually now want to have this talent,

364
00:12:29,838 --> 00:12:31,561
where before I didn't even think about it

365
00:12:31,561 --> 00:12:33,186
because it's a real skill.

366
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,421
There's two different things going on.

367
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,706
The skill of like being
able to maneuver shit

368
00:12:38,706 --> 00:12:41,270
and then the skill of story
telling and all the other stuff.

369
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,975
Yeah.
- And still keep...

370
00:12:42,975 --> 00:12:44,966
- Like, I know exactly
what that is, you know?

371
00:12:44,966 --> 00:12:46,005
And like to me...

372
00:12:46,005 --> 00:12:46,888
- What's that card?

373
00:12:46,888 --> 00:12:48,007
- That's the ace of spades.

374
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:49,795
- Okay, that's the card isn't it.

375
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:50,675
- You know, like...

376
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:51,689
Oh, oh.

377
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:52,522
- Oh, shit.

378
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,355
- Shit.

379
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,540
- I'm sorry, those are the...

380
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,741
(screaming)

381
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:58,298
- That's what's up, man.

382
00:12:58,298 --> 00:12:59,679
That's what's up.

383
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,179
That is what's up.

384
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,695
To me, that will forever...

385
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:07,413
Honestly, that is so fucking gangster.

386
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:11,580
I have so much respect for
that and I'm so grateful that

387
00:13:12,798 --> 00:13:15,398
that is what I'm actually
doing in life, with my life.

388
00:13:15,398 --> 00:13:16,231
- That's amazing.

389
00:13:16,231 --> 00:13:17,718
That's a gift for you.

390
00:13:17,718 --> 00:13:18,551
Thank you.

391
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:19,866
- Dude, that was so badass.

392
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:20,705
- Thank you, thank you.

393
00:13:20,705 --> 00:13:21,982
- That was so good, so good.

394
00:13:21,982 --> 00:13:25,048
And I made it so much better
by talking and stuff, right?

395
00:13:25,048 --> 00:13:26,456
I made it so much better.

396
00:13:26,456 --> 00:13:27,289
I gotta go.

397
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:28,122
See ya.
- No problem.

398
00:13:28,122 --> 00:13:28,955
- All right, guys, take care of yourself.

399
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:29,788
- Take it easy, Gary, thank you.

400
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:32,400
- Hello, New York, and welcome
to the very first episode

401
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,831
of New York City Pulse.

402
00:13:33,831 --> 00:13:36,641
A brand new show that
dives deep into the mindset

403
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:38,185
of New Yorkers with the relentless drive,

404
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:40,016
in pursuit of their ambition

405
00:13:40,016 --> 00:13:41,557
and our very first guest today

406
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:43,653
absolutely exemplifies this description.

407
00:13:43,653 --> 00:13:45,986
The man sitting next to me here is

408
00:13:45,986 --> 00:13:48,415
the one and only, Gary Vanyerchuk.

409
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,560
I know you have siblings.

410
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,686
- Yes.
You have two younger siblings

411
00:13:50,686 --> 00:13:51,526
is that right?
- Yes.

412
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:54,775
- So, with your father's
absence for most of the time

413
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:56,300
did that force you to step up at home into

414
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,104
- 100%.
more of a leadership role.

415
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:58,937
- 100%.

416
00:13:58,937 --> 00:14:00,262
I think it's a good observation
that people don't...

417
00:14:00,262 --> 00:14:01,826
I'm already optimistic for your show

418
00:14:01,826 --> 00:14:04,007
because I think it's a good observation

419
00:14:04,007 --> 00:14:07,213
that I don't remember a
lot of people asking me.

420
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,112
That's exactly right.

421
00:14:09,112 --> 00:14:12,925
I mean, me and my mom
are only 20 years apart.

422
00:14:12,925 --> 00:14:13,758
- Mmm.

423
00:14:13,758 --> 00:14:16,263
- So when I was 14, she was 34.

424
00:14:16,263 --> 00:14:17,762
Like, Justin, how old are you?

425
00:14:17,762 --> 00:14:18,595
- [Justin] 21.

426
00:14:18,595 --> 00:14:20,055
- Justin's 21, I'm 42.

427
00:14:20,055 --> 00:14:20,888
My mom...

428
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:23,288
I'm older than my mom,

429
00:14:23,288 --> 00:14:25,981
like, our gap is bigger
than me and my mom.

430
00:14:25,981 --> 00:14:28,274
And I feel like we are contemporaries.

431
00:14:28,274 --> 00:14:29,504
He doesn't feel like we're contemporaries,

432
00:14:29,504 --> 00:14:32,783
but he doesn't think I'm
as old as I actually am

433
00:14:32,783 --> 00:14:33,888
compared to him, given like my vibe,

434
00:14:33,888 --> 00:14:35,619
but that's how my mom was, right?

435
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:38,138
Like, duh, she was my
mom, but we were like...

436
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:39,767
Yeah, she was 34, I was
14 and we were like...

437
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:43,319
My dad wasn't around so like,
you know, I babysat the kids,

438
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:44,630
and I like, set the tone

439
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,952
and I was a leader in my
house from the get, for sure.

440
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,705
- And that definitely paved the road

441
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:50,581
for you to be an effective
leader, leading VaynerMedia?

442
00:14:50,581 --> 00:14:51,414
- 100%.

443
00:14:51,414 --> 00:14:52,954
100,000%.

444
00:14:52,954 --> 00:14:56,028
I think that's a very astute observation

445
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,668
that a lot of people have not made.

446
00:14:57,668 --> 00:14:59,707
I listen by watching what people do.

447
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:02,833
Like I already know what
sneakers he's wearing, right?

448
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,978
I'm paying attention to how
you're wearing your hair.

449
00:15:04,978 --> 00:15:05,811
- [Host] Really?

450
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:06,644
- Yeah.

451
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:07,477
- [Host] What do you think?

452
00:15:07,477 --> 00:15:08,310
- I think it's different.

453
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,143
- [Host] Okay.

454
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:11,832
- I think it's kind of like
Fez from "That 70's Show".

455
00:15:11,832 --> 00:15:12,855
I think it's a throwback.

456
00:15:12,855 --> 00:15:13,688
- Okay.

457
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:16,178
- And honestly, I took note of that.

458
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:18,595
I'm like what does that mean?

459
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:20,912
I like that shit.

460
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:24,633
So, I've learned how to
listen without talking.

461
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:27,087
Excuse me, I've learned how to listen

462
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:29,735
without the other person
talking, my whole life.

463
00:15:29,735 --> 00:15:30,963
That's how you do sales.

464
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,521
You know, I used to do
baseball card shows.

465
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:33,811
I would stand by a table.

466
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:35,585
He would walk table to table to table,

467
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:36,733
and he would look at my cards.

468
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:38,348
He would not say anything
because he's a shopper.

469
00:15:38,348 --> 00:15:40,980
I'd say, can I help you and he'd say, no.

470
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,297
Well, I could have checked out
and been lazy, but I wasn't.

471
00:15:44,297 --> 00:15:46,578
I would then spend my time looking at him,

472
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:47,673
without being creepy.

473
00:15:47,673 --> 00:15:49,348
I'd like kind of like look and be like,

474
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,625
let me know if I can
help you with anything.

475
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:51,607
I would watch.

476
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:53,101
I would watch what he would look at.

477
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:55,236
What made him buy, why, who?

478
00:15:55,236 --> 00:15:56,734
Then I'd watch him at the table

479
00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:59,321
if he went to the left and
right, see what he did there.

480
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:00,154
I learned how to...

481
00:16:00,154 --> 00:16:00,987
Then I did retail.

482
00:16:00,987 --> 00:16:01,985
I stood behind a register all day

483
00:16:01,985 --> 00:16:03,236
and just would watch people.

484
00:16:03,236 --> 00:16:04,824
So, I watch.

485
00:16:04,824 --> 00:16:07,016
- Right, but that's in person sales,

486
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:09,002
but now you're leading a much
bigger company and you don't

487
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:12,312
have that ability to watch
other people as much now, so...

488
00:16:12,312 --> 00:16:13,392
- Yeah, but guess what?

489
00:16:13,392 --> 00:16:15,762
Once you have that seed, you
understand how to scale it.

490
00:16:15,762 --> 00:16:16,595
- Got it.

491
00:16:16,595 --> 00:16:18,896
- Here's the part, that I
have that I figured out,

492
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:19,729
as of magic.

493
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:20,603
Magic.

494
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:22,923
No expectations of others.

495
00:16:22,923 --> 00:16:25,489
I do great by him, I do great
by him, I do great by him.

496
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:26,322
I eat his shit.

497
00:16:26,322 --> 00:16:28,826
I do great, I do great, I do great.

498
00:16:28,826 --> 00:16:30,427
Then he goes does something,
something good happens,

499
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:31,864
he can help me, and he doesn't?

500
00:16:31,864 --> 00:16:34,687
For some weird reason,
I don't give a fuck.

501
00:16:34,687 --> 00:16:37,640
And so many people get crippled.

502
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,511
So many people do very
little and expect...

503
00:16:40,511 --> 00:16:43,305
Do you know most people
give with expectation.

504
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:44,432
- Yes.

505
00:16:44,432 --> 00:16:45,854
- What the fuck am I getting out of this?

506
00:16:45,854 --> 00:16:47,422
- Nothing.

507
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:48,611
Thank you for doing this.

508
00:16:48,611 --> 00:16:50,351
- I mean, this is your first fucking show.

509
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:51,424
Nine people are going to watch.

510
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:52,257
- That's right.

511
00:16:52,257 --> 00:16:54,101
Maybe less.
- But now,

512
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:55,079
you're going to have...

513
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,646
Do you know what your guests
are going to look at now?

514
00:16:57,646 --> 00:16:59,496
You're going to go and
fucking say, Gary Vaynerchuk

515
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:00,619
was my first fucking guest.

516
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,160
You're going to get 10
times the quality guests

517
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,993
you would have gotten.

518
00:17:03,993 --> 00:17:04,826
You're going to get...

519
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:08,031
Guest number four of this show
is the quality of the guest

520
00:17:08,031 --> 00:17:09,990
you would have been guest 147,

521
00:17:09,991 --> 00:17:13,577
just by me allocating this 15 minutes.

522
00:17:13,577 --> 00:17:15,451
- And that's again, an example of giving

523
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,566
without expecting in return.

524
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:19,691
- That's right, and if you
go on to become Larry King,

525
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:23,464
and I need to promote
some shit in 21 years.

526
00:17:23,464 --> 00:17:24,834
- Well you know who has you.

527
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:26,759
- Or not and this is the key.

528
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,560
That would be great and I hope so

529
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,091
and surely I think about
that, but if you said no,

530
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:35,924
through your booker, I
would say to my ad man,

531
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:39,662
I would say that's some shit.

532
00:17:39,662 --> 00:17:41,690
Ad man would be like fucking,
motherfucker, you know?

533
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,780
But I would never be...

534
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,801
The extent of it would
be like that fucking kid,

535
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:48,206
that fucking kid would
be nowhere if I didn't do

536
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:49,844
the first fucking episode,
which I wouldn't believe,

537
00:17:49,844 --> 00:17:51,316
by the way, because if
somebody gets somewhere,

538
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:52,926
you might have been part of
their path but I don't...

539
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:53,759
You know?

540
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:54,592
- Right, right, right.

541
00:17:54,592 --> 00:17:56,134
- Maybe I accelerated it, but
we all accelerate each other.

542
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:57,368
Maybe I wouldn't be where I was if

543
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:58,450
Justin didn't make a video.

544
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,504
Like, there's a million what ifs.

545
00:17:59,504 --> 00:18:02,031
Here's what I would say for some reason,

546
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:04,575
after about a minute of
being like, fuck that kid,

547
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:06,680
I hope his show gets canceled, you know,

548
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,783
like competitive shit,

549
00:18:07,783 --> 00:18:09,887
I'd be like, maybe he's in a bad place,

550
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:11,262
maybe he's going through a
divorce, maybe he forgot,

551
00:18:11,262 --> 00:18:14,338
maybe he thinks about it
differently than I did.

552
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:15,712
I have empathy, man.

553
00:18:15,712 --> 00:18:17,962
Empathy is a powerful drug.

554
00:18:19,026 --> 00:18:20,717
- So at 19, you probably
had some vision of

555
00:18:20,717 --> 00:18:23,132
what your life would
look like at 42, right?

556
00:18:23,132 --> 00:18:24,006
- Yeah.

557
00:18:24,006 --> 00:18:26,431
- So how does what has actually happened

558
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,820
compare to that vision that
you had when you were 19?

559
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,926
Are you there, did you meet it?

560
00:18:29,926 --> 00:18:31,660
- I don't live in the suburbs.

561
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,910
I thought that.

562
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:38,328
I can't see anything else.

563
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:41,013
I knew I'd be successful,
like really successful.

564
00:18:41,013 --> 00:18:42,438
- What told you that?

565
00:18:42,438 --> 00:18:44,389
- The fact that I was
already successful at 19,

566
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,849
selling toys and baseball
cards and like, I was, dude,

567
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:49,873
I wish I was documenting my whole life.

568
00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:52,787
You know, like people
don't know my true story.

569
00:18:52,787 --> 00:18:54,674
Meaning, people hear this story,

570
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:56,488
I went into my dad's
business and did $3 million.

571
00:18:56,488 --> 00:18:58,425
Immediately, when you hear
that statement, you're like,

572
00:18:58,425 --> 00:18:59,760
Dad put him on.

573
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,934
People don't know that I built
my dad's business for him

574
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:06,344
and left Wine Library at 34 with nothing

575
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:07,898
in equity in that company, right?

576
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:10,066
People don't know that
like, I never paid myself

577
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,779
that much money, so I
had not that much money.

578
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:15,275
People don't know what it
looks like to have no money

579
00:19:15,275 --> 00:19:16,909
and make $3,000 a weekend,

580
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:20,242
pre-internet, as a 15 year old, in 1990.

581
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:24,288
That's what I did with no
fucking money, motherfuckers.

582
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,101
I went traded with kids, made good trades,

583
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:28,939
went to a baseball card show, sold some,

584
00:19:28,939 --> 00:19:31,756
saved my $80, bought more stuff.

585
00:19:31,756 --> 00:19:34,238
It takes talent to make $3,000.

586
00:19:34,238 --> 00:19:38,537
99% of you audience doesn't
know how to make $3,000 a week.

587
00:19:38,537 --> 00:19:40,951
I did it at 15 with no fucking money.

588
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:43,868
So, I knew I was fucking, all time.

589
00:19:44,994 --> 00:19:45,978
- From the get?

590
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:47,031
- From the fucking get.

591
00:19:47,031 --> 00:19:48,027
You know what I was doing at 19?

592
00:19:48,027 --> 00:19:50,389
I was calling my mom at college, crying,

593
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,087
saying I don't want to go
into the family business

594
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:54,233
even though I want to
help because one day,

595
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:55,729
everybody will hold that over me

596
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:58,235
and say that I was given something.

597
00:19:58,235 --> 00:20:00,432
That's why I don't own
anything in Wine Library.

598
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,580
Ultimately, I never
wanted anything because

599
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,391
I don't want anybody to
have any excuse not to chase

600
00:20:04,391 --> 00:20:05,514
their dream and work fucking hard

601
00:20:05,514 --> 00:20:08,337
because I knew I'd be the
greatest example of it of all time

602
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:11,802
and I didn't want them
to have something on me.

603
00:20:11,802 --> 00:20:15,080
I want people to understand,
if you're good enough,

604
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,913
you will win.

605
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:19,694
You have to be patient and
you have to put in the work.

606
00:20:19,694 --> 00:20:22,440
If this show is going to
be big, it will be big.

607
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,969
You just got to put in the
work and deploy the patience.

608
00:20:25,969 --> 00:20:27,454
Let's go rapid fire round.

609
00:20:27,454 --> 00:20:28,455
- Rapid fire round.

610
00:20:28,455 --> 00:20:29,705
- I'll go fast.

611
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,226
- Let's talk legacy.

612
00:20:32,226 --> 00:20:33,059
- Yes.

613
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:34,247
- Okay, death is a...

614
00:20:34,247 --> 00:20:35,611
- Scares the shit out of me.

615
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:36,444
- Scares the shit out of you.

616
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:37,277
- Yes, I hate it, don't want to die.

617
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,110
- You don't want to talk about it?

618
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:38,943
- I'll talk about it.

619
00:20:38,943 --> 00:20:39,908
I definitely don't want to die.

620
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:41,598
- So, look, you seem
like the type of person

621
00:20:41,598 --> 00:20:42,811
who wants to be in control of everything.

622
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:43,644
- Yes.

623
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:45,245
- So now, if you had the luxury of

624
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,415
being able to control when you go...

625
00:20:47,415 --> 00:20:48,248
- Yes.

626
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,356
- In a perfect world, when would that be?

627
00:20:50,356 --> 00:20:52,169
- Nine...
After you accomplish

628
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:54,226
something, when you're ripe old age?

629
00:20:54,226 --> 00:20:55,059
- I can go tomorrow from a...

630
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:56,620
No, no, no, no, no.

631
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,588
It's not about putting
points on the board.

632
00:20:58,588 --> 00:21:00,402
That's already done.

633
00:21:00,402 --> 00:21:02,309
When I made $100,000 a year,

634
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:04,023
that was my only weird thing on the board.

635
00:21:04,023 --> 00:21:05,901
Yes, I want to buy the Jets.

636
00:21:05,901 --> 00:21:06,734
- Cha-ching, I won.

637
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:08,166
- Yes, I want to buy the Jets,

638
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,319
but I want to try to buy the
Jets more than getting to.

639
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:15,836
You know, the thrill of the
chase more than the, right?

640
00:21:15,836 --> 00:21:17,440
I just want to live forever.

641
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,273
It's fun.

642
00:21:19,556 --> 00:21:21,527
What the fuck do I want to die for?

643
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:22,775
- You want to be immortal?

644
00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:24,514
- Yeah, hell yeah, but if you
had to but a number on it,

645
00:21:24,514 --> 00:21:25,979
I don't know, $9 billion, fine.

646
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:27,351
Maybe I'll get mad when I get up there

647
00:21:27,351 --> 00:21:28,977
and instead wish I did
$80 billion, but like,

648
00:21:28,977 --> 00:21:30,277
$9 billion's fine.

649
00:21:30,277 --> 00:21:33,860
- Final question, Gary,
fill in this blank,

650
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,756
Gary Vanyerchuk is...

651
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:38,238
- The greatest.

652
00:21:38,238 --> 00:21:41,020
- The greatest, and
with that we wrap up...

653
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,003
- I have to preface it
because Muhammad Ali actually

654
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,250
took it, and he deserves it,
and it should stay there.

655
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,167
Gary Vanyerchuk was the

656
00:21:50,387 --> 00:21:53,220
disproportionate best entrepreneur

657
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:58,709
of a generation in, in helping
the other entrepreneurs,

658
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,588
while he was getting his.

659
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:03,770
Got it?

660
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,801
Gary Vanyerchuk
- I can agree to that.

661
00:22:05,801 --> 00:22:09,968
was the best entrepreneur in
helping other entrepreneurs

662
00:22:10,924 --> 00:22:13,256
while getting his.

663
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:15,040
So it doesn't mean that I'm
going to make the most money.

664
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,066
It doesn't mean that I'm
going to be Elon Musk or,

665
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:20,752
you know, bazucs or
bazos, the most, right,

666
00:22:20,752 --> 00:22:23,473
or the most iconic and
change the game, Elon,

667
00:22:23,473 --> 00:22:25,222
and things like that.

668
00:22:25,222 --> 00:22:28,754
It doesn't mean that I
was just like an author

669
00:22:28,754 --> 00:22:33,368
that helped a lot of people or
Oprah or Tony Robbins, right?

670
00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:36,575
I was the best at
building the biggest thing

671
00:22:36,575 --> 00:22:40,038
and trying to drag everybody with me,

672
00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:42,422
because I didn't think
any of their success

673
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:44,005
came at my expense.

674
00:22:45,928 --> 00:22:49,836
This, nobody that will look like me ever,

675
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:51,784
would ever do this interview, ever.

676
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:53,916
- Right.
- Ever.

677
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,408
- It's the legacy that you're after.

678
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:56,652
- Ever, ever, ever, ever.

679
00:22:56,652 --> 00:22:57,485
You understand?

680
00:22:57,485 --> 00:22:58,318
- Yes.

681
00:22:58,318 --> 00:23:01,210
- Nobody who's going to end up
as big of a winner, as I am,

682
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,472
would have ever done this
interview and that is my legacy.

683
00:23:04,472 --> 00:23:05,824
So, what's cooking?

684
00:23:05,824 --> 00:23:08,236
- Same old, you know?

685
00:23:08,236 --> 00:23:09,620
Some good stuff.

686
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,211
I think I was here maybe nine months ago.

687
00:23:11,211 --> 00:23:12,044
- Yep.

688
00:23:12,044 --> 00:23:15,390
- And I got tired, and Josh
is really starting to...

689
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,334
He's been following me forever,

690
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:19,034
but we're doing to play list.

691
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:21,385
And I've got to tell you this,
- It matters.

692
00:23:21,385 --> 00:23:22,796
this shit is working.

693
00:23:22,796 --> 00:23:23,629
- No shit.

694
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:24,462
- And...

695
00:23:24,462 --> 00:23:28,681
- And when you're smart
enough to hire somebody who is

696
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:31,595
following my stuff, it
speeds up the learning curve.

697
00:23:31,595 --> 00:23:32,428
- Oh, yes.
- A lot of people

698
00:23:32,428 --> 00:23:33,326
are going to go out, right,

699
00:23:33,326 --> 00:23:36,580
who are watching right now
and go hire just a video kid

700
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,407
and they're going to say go watch Gary V.

701
00:23:38,407 --> 00:23:39,889
- I gave him every book...

702
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:43,181
- How long did you
consume my stuff before?

703
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:44,311
- [Justin] I think like nine months.

704
00:23:44,311 --> 00:23:45,144
- Right, it was big.

705
00:23:45,144 --> 00:23:46,275
Like, Justin was like further...

706
00:23:46,275 --> 00:23:49,001
Because there's nuances in my shit

707
00:23:49,001 --> 00:23:50,669
and it's way more nuance
than you could dig.

708
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:54,442
You can ask him, it's even
crazier, its crazier good in...

709
00:23:54,442 --> 00:23:56,323
- We're not at the level of your...

710
00:23:56,323 --> 00:23:57,466
- No, it's not that.

711
00:23:57,466 --> 00:24:01,194
It's not about, like,
success or skills or scale,

712
00:24:01,194 --> 00:24:04,142
it's about doing the right thing.

713
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:07,559
My whole thing is so fundamentally strong

714
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,106
because it's not selfish.

715
00:24:10,106 --> 00:24:11,656
- Yeah.

716
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:12,489
Good to see you,

717
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:13,322
- Good to see you.
as always.

718
00:24:13,322 --> 00:24:14,375
- Great to meet you.

719
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,208
- [Man With Hat] Thank you, sir.

720
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,041
- So nice to meet you.

721
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:16,874
- [Woman] You too.
- Take care.

722
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:17,707
- [Gary On Recording]
Because that's the only way

723
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:18,540
they're going to get it.
- Right.

724
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,373
- [Gary On Recording] Period.

725
00:24:19,373 --> 00:24:20,776
(hip hop music)

726
00:24:20,776 --> 00:24:21,609
- That's fucking awesome.

727
00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:22,456
- [Man] Good, right?

728
00:24:22,456 --> 00:24:23,576
- I think you've got something.

729
00:24:23,576 --> 00:24:24,409
- [Man] Cool.

730
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:26,021
- Somebody has to step up in this company

731
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:29,962
or we have to hire somebody
to do that shit 24/7.

732
00:24:29,962 --> 00:24:31,272
I'm so fired up.

733
00:24:31,272 --> 00:24:32,105
I'm now starting...

734
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:33,203
What we're doing doesn't work.

735
00:24:33,203 --> 00:24:36,368
What we're going to do is,
whether Justin decides he wants

736
00:24:36,368 --> 00:24:38,967
to do this or Seth or we
hire somebody, the context is

737
00:24:38,967 --> 00:24:41,756
very simple, your fucking
life for next year

738
00:24:41,756 --> 00:24:44,332
is to be great at that.

739
00:24:44,332 --> 00:24:45,165
Prove it to...

740
00:24:45,165 --> 00:24:46,432
Like we actually just did it.

741
00:24:46,432 --> 00:24:47,975
Fuck it, chop this up I want to tweet it.

742
00:24:47,975 --> 00:24:50,228
You guys see this shit, like fucking...

743
00:24:50,228 --> 00:24:51,595
I want you to edit it

744
00:24:51,595 --> 00:24:53,091
because you understand what I'm saying.

745
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,694
If you can make these things,

746
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:56,509
show the six or seven that work.

747
00:24:56,509 --> 00:24:59,876
If you have the fucking
discipline to fucking eat shit

748
00:24:59,876 --> 00:25:02,328
for two years on my
team for dick shit money

749
00:25:02,328 --> 00:25:04,172
and look through all of
my fucking content over

750
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:05,762
the last two years,
especially the last year,

751
00:25:05,762 --> 00:25:07,774
because there's nothing
but fucking jewels and

752
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:10,065
fucking facts everywhere
that you've never seen

753
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:12,468
because we can't fucking find them.

754
00:25:12,468 --> 00:25:13,903
We fucking let them go.

755
00:25:13,903 --> 00:25:16,620
Like, fuck, like, now we've
got something from no jumper.

756
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,114
No, when we come back,
people working on daily

757
00:25:19,114 --> 00:25:20,798
be in the set, but you
fucking think it's great

758
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:23,773
to watch 18 fucking hours of
footage, 7 hours of footage.

759
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:26,410
You live for, you live
for watching that content

760
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:29,923
and finding the seven
little fucking minutes

761
00:25:29,923 --> 00:25:32,962
and making this micro
fucking content for Snapchat

762
00:25:32,962 --> 00:25:34,742
and Twitter and Facebook and Instagram.

763
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,835
These one minute fucking
memes that fucking

764
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,834
are straight fire, that are so magic.

765
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:40,508
If you want to eat shit

766
00:25:40,508 --> 00:25:43,326
and you think that you're
great at it, submit right here.

767
00:25:43,326 --> 00:25:44,907
I have no idea what
we're going to call it.

768
00:25:44,907 --> 00:25:46,376
You're going to make a Google form.

769
00:25:46,376 --> 00:25:47,944
It's going to be linked in all the things.

770
00:25:47,944 --> 00:25:48,977
There's the url.

771
00:25:48,977 --> 00:25:51,586
Garyvee.com/ICanDoIt

772
00:25:51,586 --> 00:25:52,656
That's what it is.

773
00:25:52,656 --> 00:25:55,230
Garyvee.com/ICanDoIt.

774
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,000
Go make the Google form now.

775
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,340
Submit your version of it.

776
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,430
Fucking strip the videos off
the fucking Youtubes and shit,

777
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,082
go to VideoLer if you're
a gangster, do your thing,

778
00:26:05,082 --> 00:26:08,078
make the fucking video, and submit it.

779
00:26:08,078 --> 00:26:09,393
Don't waste your time if you're dog shit

780
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:10,858
because D-rocks going to throw up on it.

781
00:26:10,858 --> 00:26:14,255
If you've got this fucking
skill, go fucking make one

782
00:26:14,255 --> 00:26:17,143
and I'll see you February
1st at VanyerMedia.

783
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:18,729
And I'm going to hire two
or three of you fuckers,

784
00:26:18,729 --> 00:26:20,199
if you can actually do it.

785
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:21,782
No question for me.

786
00:26:23,368 --> 00:26:26,281
The thought of entering
the Chinese market,

787
00:26:26,281 --> 00:26:29,269
in a meaningful way around
my thoughts, my dreams,

788
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:32,114
my aspirations, the content,
obviously, you're aware of it,

789
00:26:32,114 --> 00:26:36,281
but I agree 99.999999% of
people don't, in China.

790
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,875
And obviously for me, you know,
China is such a big part of

791
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:46,009
my future over the next 50
years and so as you know,

792
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:49,328
about a year and a half ago,
I started converting some

793
00:26:49,328 --> 00:26:51,446
of my content into Mandarin
and things of that nature.

794
00:26:51,446 --> 00:26:55,130
I produced profiles on some
of the bigger platforms Weibo,

795
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,860
and things of that nature.

796
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:01,290
Obviously, I've spent no
time in Asia prior to 2017.

797
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,960
I've been in Singapore and Hong Kong.

798
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,553
Next year, I'll be in
mainland China, twice.

799
00:27:05,553 --> 00:27:09,720
I think 2019, 2020, I think
I'm going to come very hard

800
00:27:10,615 --> 00:27:12,911
and so this is part of that.

801
00:27:12,911 --> 00:27:14,507
And so I'm very excited
and I can't wait to meet

802
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:17,944
so many of you, whether
in New York or London

803
00:27:17,944 --> 00:27:20,167
or China or Beijing, so I can't wait.

804
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:22,979
- Who are some of the
greatest communicators

805
00:27:22,979 --> 00:27:24,678
that you ever met?

806
00:27:24,678 --> 00:27:27,884
I know, perhaps, singling
someone is hard for you

807
00:27:27,884 --> 00:27:30,700
but I'd love to know who
you think about is best.

808
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,604
- That's a great question.

809
00:27:31,604 --> 00:27:33,210
Larry King.

810
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,922
Larry King interviewed me.

811
00:27:34,922 --> 00:27:37,593
He's 80 something years old.

812
00:27:37,593 --> 00:27:41,593
I was blown away by how
good he was, blown away.

813
00:27:44,602 --> 00:27:47,435
Larry King is very high up for me.

814
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:53,518
Who I've met, Nipsey Hussle, the rapper.

815
00:27:55,366 --> 00:27:59,374
He's so thoughtful about the
way he produces his songs

816
00:27:59,374 --> 00:28:04,107
and he paints such a clear
picture of his truth.

817
00:28:04,107 --> 00:28:05,857
He stands out for me.

818
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,994
I think Tim Ferriss is an
incredibly strong communicator.

819
00:28:12,994 --> 00:28:17,117
I think he's very self aware
about what he's good at,

820
00:28:17,117 --> 00:28:19,431
and I think he does a very good job

821
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,302
of communicating in his way.

822
00:28:21,302 --> 00:28:22,695
Joe Rogan.

823
00:28:22,695 --> 00:28:25,643
I think Joe Rogan's
podcast is very successful

824
00:28:25,643 --> 00:28:27,539
because he's such a good communicator.

825
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:31,100
The mix between the way
he interviews and talks,

826
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,208
I'm not as good at that
because I talk over my guests.

827
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:36,952
He has the right balance
of letting them breath

828
00:28:36,952 --> 00:28:39,636
but also getting in his.

829
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,352
So, those are some people that stand out.

830
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,644
Listen, here's my advice for men, women,

831
00:28:43,644 --> 00:28:46,677
and everything in between,
the truth is undefeated.

832
00:28:46,677 --> 00:28:49,193
I've been saying it for a very long time.

833
00:28:49,193 --> 00:28:50,673
There's no hiding.

834
00:28:50,673 --> 00:28:51,840
The gig is up.

835
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:57,754
And that's my advice for
everybody, for everything, forever.

836
00:28:57,754 --> 00:29:00,218
So that's my advice for a
dirty old man in America.

837
00:29:00,218 --> 00:29:04,406
That's my advice for China
around Tiananmen Square.

838
00:29:04,406 --> 00:29:06,032
That's my advice about everything.

839
00:29:06,032 --> 00:29:09,615
The truth, in the long
term, is undefeated.

840
00:29:10,683 --> 00:29:13,523
If you do the wrong thing, you will lose.

841
00:29:13,523 --> 00:29:17,521
You know, I know I'm American
but it's the same way I think

842
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:20,882
about an African American or
a female or a Latino girl.

843
00:29:20,882 --> 00:29:24,618
I just think its
meritocracy and capitalism

844
00:29:24,618 --> 00:29:25,823
and playing the game.

845
00:29:25,823 --> 00:29:29,505
Of course I think that
woman are going to be

846
00:29:29,505 --> 00:29:30,978
a bigger impact.

847
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,476
It's because the old rules didn't let them

848
00:29:33,476 --> 00:29:35,090
get the fair amount of impact.

849
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:37,090
They're 100% equal.

850
00:29:38,438 --> 00:29:39,271
They have different dynamics.

851
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:41,875
You know, men don't
give birth to children,

852
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:43,704
so they don't have that variable,

853
00:29:43,704 --> 00:29:47,886
so we are different but
we're the same, do you know?

854
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:48,719
- [Woman] Mm-hmm.

855
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:51,401
- So, yeah, I don't even
think of it that way.

856
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:55,137
I'm excited that the world
is getting transparent.

857
00:29:55,137 --> 00:29:58,054
I think a lot of people are not and

858
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,057
I think a lot of people are
scared of a transparent world,

859
00:30:01,057 --> 00:30:04,924
including America,
including China and Russia.

860
00:30:04,924 --> 00:30:06,334
Like, China, Russia, and America

861
00:30:06,334 --> 00:30:08,050
are not going to let
block chain get too big.

862
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,260
- [Woman] You it grass.

863
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,130
- Patience.

864
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,674
Everybody is so impatient,
especially in the Asian markets.

865
00:30:14,674 --> 00:30:17,060
You have to prove something
to your parents so much,

866
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,560
that you go so fast and so
hard just to get that chip

867
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,088
off your shoulder, either to pay them back

868
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:25,463
and you want to do good
for them or because

869
00:30:25,463 --> 00:30:26,905
you're actually mad at them
and you want to stick it

870
00:30:26,905 --> 00:30:29,885
to them, and so you start making
fast, short-term decisions

871
00:30:29,885 --> 00:30:32,480
in your 20s of what you're supposed to do

872
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,392
and it screws you up for long term.

873
00:30:34,392 --> 00:30:35,383
Thank you so much.

874
00:30:35,383 --> 00:30:36,242
You did a great job.

875
00:30:36,242 --> 00:30:37,075
(inaudible)

876
00:30:37,075 --> 00:30:37,937
Of course, you did a great job.

877
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:41,134
Heading out, voice is shot, good day.

878
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:42,268
- [Woman] Thank you, Carter.

879
00:30:42,268 --> 00:30:44,045
Thanks, Gary.

00:30:44,045 --> 00:00:00,000
