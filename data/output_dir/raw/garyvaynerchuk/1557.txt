what people are saying about you

35

thinking or caring about is what is the

most imperative factor in building a

37
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,450
business whether it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a personal</font>

listening is the key now why are a lot

42
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:02,030
of companies not doing it because it's

43
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,400

reviewing whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it comes down</font>

51
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,260
to caring people and way too many people

52
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">just don't care or it's just too hard</font>

53
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,630
you know why it's hard

54
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,090
because it takes a lot of this it takes

55
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,550
a crap load of time and people don't

paying attention to what people are

60
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,520
