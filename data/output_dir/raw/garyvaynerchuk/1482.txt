24
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,270
passion for you to really create

25
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,489
something when you were a trivet money

26
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,469

28
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,080
slide plenty of other things as well but

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,560
you know it's crazy like it goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,299
being five or six years old and trying

31
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,310
to sell<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff you know at some level you</font>

32
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,530
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNA is one powerful thin and it's</font>

33
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,880
just something that has always been

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,430
there I've never filtered the world

35
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,830
without thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about business that's</font>

36
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,840
just been in my brain you know I've

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">always thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about how can i sell this</font>

38
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,920
or how come and do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just it's</font>

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,470
there and so to me it didn't seem weird

40
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,680
to me like when it started snowing I did

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,750
not think about building<font color="#CCCCCC"> a snowman I was</font>

42
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,700
like looked you know oh I should make a

43
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,149
quick note my sister<font color="#CCCCCC"> is literally in</font>

44
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,790
labor right this second so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want</font>

45
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,950
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all know how much I'm committed</font>

46
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,390
to commitments because family is my

47
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,009
thing and I'm getting the hell out

48
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,930
usually as I told you the phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

49
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,729
going to stay a little longer shake some

50
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:59,430

53
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,010
minute but speaking of thank you

54
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,649
speaking of that my sister like it

55
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:10,060
started snowing and then I would just

56
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,680
look at my sister's face you know as a

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,720
team is<font color="#CCCCCC"> bored I was like get your</font>

58
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,910
 shovel I you know that's like I

59
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,650
just pump when it would snow because I

60
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,240
knew that I was going to shovel

61
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,820
driveways and make cash and you know a

62
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of people around me know that I i</font>

63
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,950
don't i'm not obsessed about scale I

64
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,010
like putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the work I like the dirt</font>

65
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,440
under my fingernails I'm proud of it I

66
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,300
think it matters more than I think we

67
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,860
think I think we're living through a

68
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,360
culture of a lot of smart people right

69
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,420
now especially nurse in our space here

70
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,790
that are very predicated on the math and

71
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">the analytics and the efficiencies I</font>

72
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,080
take the bonus prior to caring about

73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,790
that stuff but I think you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font>

74
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,650
in the work and putting in the work has

75
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,030
been something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's always just come</font>

76
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,880
very naturally I mean we've seen it

77
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,320
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> were eager like right after</font>

78
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,959
college<font color="#E5E5E5"> she decided to really get your</font>

79
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,610
hands dirty with your parents business

00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:07,630

84
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:13,780
would rate these wines and have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

85
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,680
unique way of getting even the least

86
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,660
common denominator wine connoisseurs

87
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,670
myself included to sort of understand

88
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,620
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see here from Istanbul</font>

89
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,500

00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,050
did that this is a great<font color="#CCCCCC"> show we all</font>

94
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,240
looked it but you at one point in his

95
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,830
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I may be her biggest</font>

96
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,330
little bit later than that you decided

97
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:51,590
to stop and stopping almost anything is

98
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,420
really tough you know mental<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you</font>

99
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,400
come to that as an entrepreneur well I

100
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,520
mean it was 2011 I did a thousand

101
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,700
episodes of wine library TV and a month

102
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,250
before I decided I decided three or four

103
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,130
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier than five years of five</font>

104
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,070
days a week putting out a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 25 minute show</font>

105
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,800
was a good run right they were you know

106
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,780
it's not and I decided that I was gonna

107
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,779
retire and at the last minute maybe

108
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,670
three months you know two months right

109
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,190
before I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to retire i bought i</font>

110
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,840
started feeling like I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let</font>

111
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,910
people down I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to let my but</font>

112
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,530
you know I started reading every comment

113
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,950
started 3 years comments 20 40 comments

114
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,080
per episode saying don't ever stop

115
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,120
people knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was like you know</font>

116
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,370
that I was grinding and all of a sudden

117
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">when I knew I was going to stop every</font>

118
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">time I saw that in the comments section</font>

119
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,070
in her and they like started building

120
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,200
and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of panic and I decided to</font>

121
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,030
start something called daily great for

122
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,260
the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hear that most thought</font>

123
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,540
let me remember and I decided okay if

124
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,010
I'm gonna stop let me do something new a

125
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,930
shorter form because I was into this

126
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,550
whole micro content thing that

127
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,850
vaynermedia is involved into mobile so

128
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,040
his mobile driven subscription to buy

129
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,990
the great show I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make it work</font>

130
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">for me it just the decision was done at</font>

131
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,000
that point so I did do 89 episodes of

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,700
that as well you know I decided it was

133
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,410
time you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know just woke up one morning</font>

134
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,640
in early 2011 I was like said you know I

135
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,090
didn't I'm at this point now where I

136
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,640
feel complete about this part of my

137
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,740
career and journey and there's other

138
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,150
things that we're starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull up my</font>

139
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,770
heartstrings and other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I was</font>

140
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,870

141
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">knew that it was going to be a chapter I</font>

142
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,229

was fascinating to me that I was happy

158
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,080
that I made that decision because i was

159
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,390
i was getting ridiculous offers to do a

160
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,760

162
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,820
very attractive they would have allowed

163
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,280
me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> become really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> famous I would have</font>

164
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,340

165
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">eleventh hour on these deals mainly</font>

166
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,300
because I knew that I would become

167
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,250
America's blind guy if I made that play

168
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,690
and I just do there was other things I

169
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,520
want to talk about and I didn't want to

170
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,310
pigeonhole myself and heck if a fairly

171
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,740

172
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,090

<font color="#CCCCCC">Lane what would have a hit TV show them</font>

174
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,530

175
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,210
right like it happens that there's like

176
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,190

250
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,060
am both of them a little bit more

251
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,330
introverted differently wired so I spent

252
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,830
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of time understanding what makes</font>

253
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,600

bring that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the table and then you</font>

255
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:53,990

256
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to allow me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do what I came</font>

257
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,750
to do it's changed in the fact that you

258
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,210
know a generator running of a company

259
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,690
vaynermedia has gone from 25 to 250

260

<font color="#CCCCCC">moving very fast them there's a lot of</font>

264
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,570
Boehner employees in here and they know

265
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,000
they know that like we're running a very

266
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,190
fast entrepreneurial here can we have

267
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,630
our ups and downs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and left's and rights</font>

268
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,640
and the unfortunate thing that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

269
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,320
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to take time to</font>

270
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,940
step out of your business line because

271
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,360
the aging and i only<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about bad</font>

272
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,600
stuff AJ and I only talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about bad stuff</font>

273
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,610
that's what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're a leader</font>

274
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,260
that's what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're running</font>

275
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,330
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ship you're talking about the</font>

276
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,860
problems because you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

277
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">address them and we actively try to</font>

278
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,880
figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to celebrate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the wins</font>

279
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,520
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not in our DNA climbers so</font>

280
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're worried about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rocks the head</font>

281
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,760
of us the rocks were dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

282
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,460
now we didn't never celebrate enough and

283
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,220
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what's what's changed is where all</font>

284
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,080
our conversations used to be predicated

285
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,210
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> lightly you know we stress about the</font>

286
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,070
jet but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the most part it</font>

287
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,960
was pretty lightweight stuff now talking

288
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,970
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> very intense stuff very like very</font>

289
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,610
rained into it and it's it's been an

290
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,310
interesting journey with him because I'm

291
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,290
mentoring him before I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of the</font>

292
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,030
son of a father<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I'm in a</font>

293
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,340
different place I think it's working

294
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,770
extremely well the thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Jedi</font>

295
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,730

00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,630
is time and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> given time to so many</font>

332
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,720
things that on paper are difficult to

333
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,060
understand life and in retrospect are

334
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,389
difficult to understand why that's why

335
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:13,529
you know like I you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really you</font>

337
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,010
success is predicated on it so I could

338
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,480
never hate on it and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would talk about</font>

339

me a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here know why am I</font>

340
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,920
will talk a lot about negatives

341
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,910
everybody's got problems I'm

342
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,050
uncomfortable share

343
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,810
line but it's you know as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

344
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,370
getting more known you know what am I

345
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,839
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about crushing it every 40</font>

346
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,730
seconds so you try to evolve you know

347
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,130
your conversation and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

348
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,440
talking you know I'm a minority I'm an

349
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,510
edge case so after<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about things</font>

350
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,860
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think other people aren't seeing</font>

351
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,350
and it built up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fortunate up in a</font>

352
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,579
place where this many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,980
come and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see me speak then I started</font>

355
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,190
start talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> one or two percent or</font>

356
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,690
three percent that actually do look like

357
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:54,269
me that you know and and that's been

358
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:55,560
where some of those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> have come out</font>

359

<font color="#CCCCCC">and I actually appreciate your doing</font>

tough time staying<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I have a very</font>

363
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,640
tough time not trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to over-deliver</font>

364
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,399
even it's for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect stranger let</font>

365
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,680
alone<font color="#E5E5E5"> an entry level employee I've</font>

366
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">employed on his first day or so many</font>

00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,570
that's in my world you know hi Evan I /

368
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,000
index the things that I / index on like

369

empathy are why I'm successful but

370
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,140
they're also very difficult to manage

371
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,329
and it's exhausting like you know just

372
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:26,610
I'm consuming and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pressure</font>

373
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,980
from every direction from my two

374
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,250
businesses from my personal brand from

375
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">the people that are cynical and have</font>

376
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,240
paid out there for it for for the

377
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,560
concerns I have for everybody my

378
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,770
organization let it not be confused and

379
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,880
there's plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of vaynor people in here</font>

380
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">and they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's true I'm the head of</font>

381
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,850

I'm Michael managing everybody's

384
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:53,940
emotions to the best of my ability I

385
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,550
forgot that I've gotten older and I've

386
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,020
had a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> success of my career so I</font>

387
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">think some of the entry-level employees</font>

388
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,170
don't believe it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're scared to</font>

389
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,180
engage with me but once they do they're

390
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,329
surprised and so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I consume</font>

391
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:10,380
emotion at scale and and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be</font>

392
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,110
daunting<font color="#CCCCCC"> at times you clearly worked on</font>

393
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,480
many many things and one that sort of

394

things run<font color="#E5E5E5"> through my mind one should I</font>

434
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,980
ever consider getting a little deeper in
