1
00:00:00,395 --> 00:00:01,628
- Hey everybody, it's Gary Vaynerchuck

2
00:00:01,628 --> 00:00:03,381
and this is Pod Sessions number three

3
00:00:03,381 --> 00:00:05,182
if you're just joining.

4
00:00:05,182 --> 00:00:07,924
I've always wanted to bring
interesting people together

5
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:10,350
and talk about current events.

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,511
I think that that dude from Swingers

7
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:13,344
Fav?

8
00:00:13,344 --> 00:00:14,327
I always get his last name wrong.

9
00:00:14,327 --> 00:00:15,160
Favrieau?

10
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,993
- Favreau.
- Favreau.

11
00:00:15,993 --> 00:00:17,778
Jon Favreau had that dinner party

12
00:00:17,778 --> 00:00:20,408
of dinner thing that caught
my attention on cable

13
00:00:20,408 --> 00:00:24,079
like 17 years ago when I
used to consume content

14
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:26,194
as my three guests will say in a minute,

15
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:28,485
they consume an obnoxious
amount of content.

16
00:00:28,485 --> 00:00:31,154
We'll speak to that issue in a minute.

17
00:00:31,154 --> 00:00:33,299
But, finally we're doing it.

18
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,273
Obviously, I referenced
before, my career change

19
00:00:36,273 --> 00:00:39,045
when I started doing these jam sessions

20
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:40,548
at South by Southwest and other places

21
00:00:40,548 --> 00:00:42,064
with people that went on to

22
00:00:42,064 --> 00:00:44,198
become the biggest investors and makers

23
00:00:44,198 --> 00:00:45,772
of the greatest apps,

24
00:00:45,772 --> 00:00:47,739
and I think we're living
through a culture shift

25
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:49,836
right now around.

26
00:00:49,836 --> 00:00:52,024
It's why row crushing it.

27
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:54,184
I just think there's more room,

28
00:00:54,184 --> 00:00:56,437
way more room, for us to do our thing

29
00:00:56,437 --> 00:00:58,838
in this internet thing than we realize

30
00:00:58,838 --> 00:01:01,067
and even I didn't realize how much,

31
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:03,010
and that's all I focused on for a decade.

32
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,257
So I realized wow,
there's a lot more to go.

33
00:01:05,257 --> 00:01:08,174
I've quadruple downed
over the last 24 months.

34
00:01:08,174 --> 00:01:10,367
It's changed a lot for me

35
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:12,058
and I try to bring on people

36
00:01:12,058 --> 00:01:15,490
who I think are interesting
entrepreneurs doing fun stuff

37
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,437
and also have a point
of view on that world.

38
00:01:19,437 --> 00:01:20,832
And so that's what we're doing here.

39
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:23,115
So I'm super excited for these three.

40
00:01:23,115 --> 00:01:24,561
One I know pretty darn well.

41
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:26,174
The other two I'm getting to know,

42
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:28,843
and actually had meetings with
as recently as this morning

43
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:29,676
for the first time.

44
00:01:29,676 --> 00:01:30,509
Even though Jerry's played

45
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:31,342
a bunch of basketball

46
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:32,175
with my crew.
- Yes.

47
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,329
And we'll get into that.

48
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:35,328
And I'm excited about this show,

49
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:36,506
I think it's gonna be a good one.

50
00:01:36,506 --> 00:01:38,276
So why don't we do the introduction part.

51
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:40,236
Or, I'd like you to introduce yourself,

52
00:01:40,236 --> 00:01:41,303
what you do.

53
00:01:41,303 --> 00:01:43,311
And maybe like a quick, one minute recap,

54
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:46,493
four to six bullets on yourself.

55
00:01:46,493 --> 00:01:48,459
Why don't you go?
- I knew I was gonna have to.

56
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:49,292
- [Gary] Yes, ladies first.

57
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:50,417
- It's always the worst.

58
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:51,250
Alright, so.

59
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,416
- You think going first is worse?

60
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,874
Let's talk about that first.

61
00:01:53,874 --> 00:01:55,217
Before we go into intros.
- Going first is worst.

62
00:01:55,217 --> 00:01:57,379
- You were about to say
it's always the worst.

63
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:59,674
- [Danielle] Well because
they have time to think about

64
00:01:59,674 --> 00:02:00,674
what they're going to say.

65
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:02,130
- I promise I won't think.

66
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,862
- Alright, then just
focus on what I'm saying.

67
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:04,695
(laughing)

68
00:02:04,695 --> 00:02:06,872
Liz will think, I know Liz
well enough to know that.

69
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:08,614
- [Gary] You know everybody at this table.

70
00:02:08,614 --> 00:02:11,218
- We've known each other for
like five years now, I think.

71
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:12,466
- [Danielle] And Gary, you're my people.

72
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,340
I tell everyone that I'm the third--

73
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,938
- [Gary] Do you know everybody?

74
00:02:14,938 --> 00:02:16,944
Do you tell everybody
you're the fourth amigo?

75
00:02:16,944 --> 00:02:19,306
- No I was just going
to say I tell everyone

76
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,577
that I'm the three something
female version of you.

77
00:02:21,577 --> 00:02:22,410
I'm really flattering myself.

78
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,643
- The amount of people that tell me

79
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,332
they're the female Gary V is absurd.

80
00:02:25,332 --> 00:02:27,364
- [Danielle] But I think
I'm going to go with that.

81
00:02:27,364 --> 00:02:28,668
- [Gary] I respect that.

82
00:02:28,668 --> 00:02:30,153
- And My dad is in PR
so it works, anyways.

83
00:02:30,153 --> 00:02:31,690
Other than my dad's name being Gary,

84
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,424
my name's Danielle Snyder.

85
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:35,617
I have a label called Danny
Jo with my sister Jodie.

86
00:02:35,617 --> 00:02:37,442
- Who's here by the way for
moral support and to answer

87
00:02:37,442 --> 00:02:38,608
all real questions.

88
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:40,523
- [Danielle] She's my other
half we share a brain.

89
00:02:40,523 --> 00:02:41,481
She's here as my life line

90
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:42,711
in case you guys want to talk sports.

91
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:44,486
- If you guys share a
brain what percentage

92
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:45,850
is you and what percentage is her?

93
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,750
- 50/50 it's even Steven.

94
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,633
- [Garry] Cause I always
thought she was like 87 percent.

95
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:49,716
Okay keep going.

96
00:02:49,716 --> 00:02:52,541
- If anyone is going
to be 80 it's me, but;

97
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,832
no I'm kidding, she's the better half.

98
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:55,271
- [Gary] Yeah she does have the micro fan.

99
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:57,008
- So we have a label.

100
00:02:57,008 --> 00:02:59,092
We're going on our tenth year anniversary.

101
00:02:59,092 --> 00:02:59,925
- Wow congrats.

102
00:02:59,925 --> 00:03:00,941
- [Danielle] Which is
pretty phenominal, right?

103
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:02,861
- Can you make a limited
edition piece of jewelry

104
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:04,528
with a ten on it and just give it to me

105
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:05,976
so I can flip it on ebay in 14 years?

106
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:07,445
- I'm actually glad this is being filmed

107
00:03:07,445 --> 00:03:09,341
because I wanted to talk
about a collaboration

108
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:10,904
during the show with Gary Vaynerchuck.

109
00:03:10,904 --> 00:03:11,866
So absolutely, we will.

110
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:12,699
- [Gary] Okay.

111
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:13,657
(laughter)

112
00:03:13,657 --> 00:03:14,807
- This is announced.

113
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:15,998
Announced a collab.

114
00:03:15,998 --> 00:03:17,933
- Tyler; he can push
it on all his channels.

115
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:18,941
- Right, got it.

116
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:19,774
- So we've had--

117
00:03:19,774 --> 00:03:21,564
- [Gary] And you'll keep how
much percentage of the action?

118
00:03:21,564 --> 00:03:22,397
- [Danielle] 100%.
- Understood.

119
00:03:22,397 --> 00:03:23,230
Keep going.

120
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,063
(laughter)

121
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:24,896
- [Gary] Sounds like a non profit event.

122
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:26,592
Let's keep it going

123
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,140
- So, we've had a label for 10 years.

124
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,619
A lifestyle brand.

125
00:03:29,619 --> 00:03:31,139
It's built on our sisterhood.

126
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:32,628
Our community.

127
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:34,793
We're known for our statement jewelry

128
00:03:34,793 --> 00:03:37,459
and having made our collection,

129
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:40,585
the large majority of it
here in New York City.

130
00:03:40,585 --> 00:03:43,864
And within the last year
we've expanded into fitness,

131
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:45,367
health and wellness,

132
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:46,645
travel,

133
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:48,034
and story telling.

134
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:49,590
- By executing it yourself

135
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,802
or by licensing the brand

136
00:03:50,802 --> 00:03:52,716
to people making products in those worlds.

137
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:53,982
- Executing it to ourselves

138
00:03:53,982 --> 00:03:56,423
with the intention of--
- Possibly, go it.

139
00:03:56,423 --> 00:03:57,256
Understood.

140
00:03:57,256 --> 00:04:01,653
- So, we most recently
launched a fitness movement

141
00:04:01,653 --> 00:04:05,129
called boxerina that's a
hybrid of boxing and ballet.

142
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:07,104
And we're using that as a
tool to build the community.

143
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:08,271
- That's cool.

144
00:04:09,924 --> 00:04:11,515
- And sweat with the people that we love

145
00:04:11,515 --> 00:04:14,810
and travel to our
favorite places with them

146
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,579
under the Dannijo Travels retreat series.

147
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,155
So, a lot to talk about.

148
00:04:18,156 --> 00:04:20,195
But I want you guys to fill me in

149
00:04:20,195 --> 00:04:21,291
so I can think about
what I want to say next.

150
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,614
- She's passing us the baton now.

151
00:04:22,614 --> 00:04:23,969
- [Gary] Go ahead.

152
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:25,533
- My name is Liz Eswein.

153
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,655
I have worked in the influencer space

154
00:04:27,655 --> 00:04:29,905
for probably six years now.

155
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:33,098
- You started when you were three.

156
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:34,898
- [Liz] I started when
I was three, exactly.

157
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:36,167
(laughter)

158
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,361
I was actually in college.

159
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,181
I went to NYU.

160
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:41,416
And, I had read an article that Instagram

161
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,610
had just raised to series
A of seven million dollars

162
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,993
and they had a million users.

163
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:47,147
But back story.

164
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:52,147
I had gotten really sick
with chronic lime disease.

165
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,524
My junior year so,

166
00:04:53,524 --> 00:04:55,899
So, I had always said I was gonna go work

167
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:58,733
in publishing and advertising
with a background,

168
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,295
I had an internship at Condé Nast.

169
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:01,428
- [Gary] Yup.

170
00:05:01,428 --> 00:05:04,845
And, I was barely getting through school.

171
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:07,268
And so, yeah.

172
00:05:07,268 --> 00:05:08,101
- [Gary] Because of the disease.

173
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:08,934
- [Liz] Yeah.

174
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:09,981
- Not like me, who's a
hardcore D and F student

175
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:10,814
- [Liz] No.

176
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:11,647
Totally.

177
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:12,480
- By the way, Tyler.

178
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,321
When is my report card getting here?

179
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:16,097
- [Tyler] It's public schools.

180
00:05:16,097 --> 00:05:16,972
It takes a little bit.

181
00:05:16,972 --> 00:05:17,805
- It takes a little bit.

182
00:05:17,805 --> 00:05:18,638
- [Gary] I can't get too mad at you

183
00:05:18,638 --> 00:05:20,037
because I already got it once.

184
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:21,611
Flashed it, posted an instagram photo,

185
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:22,753
but then lost it.

186
00:05:22,753 --> 00:05:23,962
Which probably speaks to why

187
00:05:23,962 --> 00:05:24,795
there was so many D's and F's on it.

188
00:05:24,795 --> 00:05:25,628
(laughter)

189
00:05:25,628 --> 00:05:26,694
But this time I'm gonna get it.

190
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:28,276
I'm gonna frame it somewhere massive.

191
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:29,109
- [Liz] Put it up on the wall.

192
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:30,005
Probably right there.

193
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:31,678
I'm gonna move Macho Man down

194
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:32,549
and I'm gonna put it right there.

195
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:33,758
So as soon as you walk in,

196
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:35,078
it sets the tone of what
you're dealing with.

197
00:05:35,078 --> 00:05:35,911
I'm sorry, keep going.

198
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:37,028
- Cool, yeah.

199
00:05:37,028 --> 00:05:39,732
So, I was just in bed one
day and read the article.

200
00:05:39,732 --> 00:05:41,419
Tried to make a few names.

201
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:42,880
They were taken.

202
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,001
And I was, well I live in New York

203
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:46,005
so here we are.

204
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:47,120
And New York City was available.

205
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,236
And it registered.

206
00:05:48,236 --> 00:05:49,427
- [Gary] So funny.

207
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:50,901
- And I kind of forgot about it.

208
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:52,769
And I didn't tell anyone because

209
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,399
when you sign up for myspace or something

210
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,665
I'm not saying;

211
00:05:55,665 --> 00:05:57,049
hey Dani, I signed up for myspace.

212
00:05:57,049 --> 00:05:59,113
- [Gary] It was a different time.

213
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:00,463
And then

214
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:02,770
that took off rather slowly.

215
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,803
The photos on there were atrocious.

216
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:05,636
They're still there.

217
00:06:05,636 --> 00:06:06,469
You can take a look.

218
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:07,639
I won't delete them.
- 'Cause you took'em.

219
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,780
- [Liz] Yeah, they were iPhone photos.

220
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,989
- So you're smart, but not creative.

221
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:12,869
(laughter)

222
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:13,702
- [Gary] No, no!

223
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:14,676
That was a question.

224
00:06:14,676 --> 00:06:15,735
That wasn't a statement.

225
00:06:15,735 --> 00:06:17,361
- [Liz] I would say a hybrid of the two.

226
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:18,194
- [Gary] Respect.

227
00:06:18,194 --> 00:06:21,746
- But there are people far
more creative than I am.

228
00:06:21,746 --> 00:06:23,027
Both my parents are entrepreneurs

229
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:25,751
and I have loved watching them
start their own businesses

230
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:29,003
and I always wanted to do that.

231
00:06:29,003 --> 00:06:32,254
Then I graduated and
started to see a shift

232
00:06:32,254 --> 00:06:35,882
and why wouldn't a brand pay 40 grand

233
00:06:35,882 --> 00:06:36,715
for a

234
00:06:37,591 --> 00:06:39,666
someone with 100 thousand followers

235
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,500
as opposed to 40 grand for a print page

236
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,434
or a print magazine that had
100 thousand in circulation.

237
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:46,267
So yeah,

238
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:48,361
I met

239
00:06:49,453 --> 00:06:50,286
two of...

240
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:53,348
Should I go into it, briefly?

241
00:06:53,348 --> 00:06:54,880
Okay, cool.

242
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,713
- Everything.

243
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:56,800
That's what we're here for.

244
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,233
- [Liz] So yeah.

245
00:06:58,233 --> 00:06:59,610
I met my first two co-founders.

246
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,465
And we started what was
really the first influencer

247
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,464
Instagram marketing agency at that time.

248
00:07:05,464 --> 00:07:06,733
Nike was our first client.

249
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:08,961
They paid us 50 dollars in cash.

250
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,457
And I remember telling my mom.

251
00:07:10,457 --> 00:07:11,290
- [Danielle] We made it.

252
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,123
Mom, I can make money!

253
00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:12,956
(laughter)

254
00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:13,789
It was awesome.

255
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:16,462
And she was like, oh Jesus.

256
00:07:16,462 --> 00:07:18,027
And I was there for two years

257
00:07:18,027 --> 00:07:21,127
and then left to start
an agency called cycle

258
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:23,923
which was part of a
larger full service agency

259
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:25,031
called laundry service.

260
00:07:25,031 --> 00:07:25,864
- [Gary] Yup.

261
00:07:25,864 --> 00:07:29,326
- And we represented a roster of talent

262
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:30,776
and really,

263
00:07:30,776 --> 00:07:33,593
I think provided a
backbone to their careers

264
00:07:33,593 --> 00:07:35,240
that were launching in this space.

265
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,247
And then we were acquired.

266
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:38,080
So long story short on how this all--

267
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,622
- [Gary] And that was good for you.

268
00:07:39,622 --> 00:07:40,455
So, you're rich.

269
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:41,288
(laughter)

270
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:42,121
- [Liz] Jesus.

271
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:42,954
- [Danielle] Great.

272
00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:45,779
- [Gary] That was a question again.

273
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:46,612
Do you want to answer it?

274
00:07:46,612 --> 00:07:47,445
- No.

275
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:48,686
- [Gary] Okay, cool; Jared?

276
00:07:48,686 --> 00:07:50,084
Thank you, I'm glad; I'm pumped to hear.

277
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:52,394
- [Danielle] She's passing
on the baton to Jared.

278
00:07:52,394 --> 00:07:54,126
- So you still own @newyorkcity.

279
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:54,959
- Yeah.

280
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,792
But I wanted to parlay.

281
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:56,924
- [Gary] And you want
to sell that to D Rock?

282
00:07:56,924 --> 00:07:57,757
- No!

283
00:07:57,757 --> 00:07:58,600
- [Danielle] Ask her the
most important question.

284
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,433
Is she gonna instagram all of us?

285
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:00,266
- [Liz] Absolutely.

286
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:02,165
- [Gary] DJ, you need to calm it down.

287
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:03,195
- [Danielle] What?

288
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:04,456
Diaz, you need to calm it down.

289
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:05,371
- [Danielle] No, but it wasn't that.

290
00:08:05,371 --> 00:08:06,204
- [Liz] Yeah, we're good.

291
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:07,037
- She's my people.

292
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:07,870
- [Liz] But yeah, I wanted to parlay--

293
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,080
- [Gary] So far, I'm you're people.

294
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,913
She's you're people.

295
00:08:09,913 --> 00:08:10,746
Jerry?

296
00:08:10,746 --> 00:08:11,579
- Jerry is my new people.

297
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:12,412
We just met, actually.

298
00:08:12,412 --> 00:08:13,402
- [Gary] You never met Jerry before?

299
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:14,468
- His wife is gorgeous.

300
00:08:14,468 --> 00:08:16,184
I know everything about his life.

301
00:08:16,184 --> 00:08:17,043
- We did.

302
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:18,639
We basically did a podcast out there.

303
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,472
- How'd it go?

304
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:21,017
- [Jerry] It went well.

305
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:22,707
I will be up later at six o'clock.

306
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:24,581
- [Gary] Did you guys film it?

307
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:25,414
- [Liz] No.

308
00:08:25,414 --> 00:08:26,247
- No, we didn't see.

309
00:08:26,247 --> 00:08:27,188
That's why we need you,
because you're a big thinker.

310
00:08:27,188 --> 00:08:28,056
- [Gary] And remind team,

311
00:08:28,056 --> 00:08:30,838
we put out our podcast at 5:59 PM.

312
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:31,921
Alright, Jer.

313
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,145
- [Jerry] And by the way,

314
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:35,761
going last is not it's
all it's cracked up to be

315
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:37,803
'cause now I gotta
follow those two stories.

316
00:08:37,804 --> 00:08:38,645
- You're gonna be great, Jerry.

317
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:39,477
(laughter)

318
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,310
- Now you're gonna hear about

319
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:44,111
the chubby Italian kid
from Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.

320
00:08:44,111 --> 00:08:44,944
- [Gary] That's fine.

321
00:08:44,944 --> 00:08:46,743
But now, you look so phenomenal.

322
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:50,348
You're on the right side
of this conversation.

323
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:51,819
It's the worst when it's the reverse.

324
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:52,759
- [Jerry] I know, right?

325
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,592
- [Gary] You've got it.

326
00:08:53,592 --> 00:08:54,425
You've figured it out.

327
00:08:54,425 --> 00:08:55,520
- I've been there, too.

328
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,536
I guess, I am Jerry Ferrara.

329
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:58,790
I am an actor.

330
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,437
Which, growing up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn

331
00:09:01,437 --> 00:09:03,909
was not the easiest trade, I would say.

332
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:06,085
There's not a lot of other
actors where I was growing up.

333
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:07,178
So I was kind of little bit of the--

334
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:09,788
- [Gary] But you were right from the get.

335
00:09:09,788 --> 00:09:11,021
- Teenage years.

336
00:09:11,021 --> 00:09:13,215
About 15, 16 years old.

337
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,475
It was really of a love of movies

338
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:18,437
and television that I just
wanted to find a way in.

339
00:09:18,437 --> 00:09:20,228
I could have easily have been

340
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:22,084
a camera operator, or an editor.

341
00:09:22,084 --> 00:09:23,655
I just wanted to be in that world.

342
00:09:23,655 --> 00:09:25,403
- [Gary] But you started with
actor and then you set it?

343
00:09:25,403 --> 00:09:26,739
- [Jerry] I stumbled into acting

344
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:29,832
'cause I was failing out
of a community college.

345
00:09:29,832 --> 00:09:30,665
- [Gary] Yes.

346
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:31,498
- Yes.

347
00:09:31,498 --> 00:09:32,331
Doing it right.

348
00:09:32,331 --> 00:09:33,447
- Our kind of people.

349
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,979
- You were my kind of people, Jerry.

350
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:36,522
- [Jerry] I took an acting class

351
00:09:36,522 --> 00:09:39,703
'cause I was told the
professor will give us an A

352
00:09:39,703 --> 00:09:40,677
if you just show up.

353
00:09:40,677 --> 00:09:41,969
So I took this acting class.

354
00:09:41,969 --> 00:09:44,163
Alright, I'm gonna finally
prove to my mom I can.

355
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:44,996
- [Gary] This is like golf or swimming.

356
00:09:44,996 --> 00:09:45,829
- Yeah.

357
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:48,294
I'm gonna prove it to
my mom I can get an A.

358
00:09:48,294 --> 00:09:49,503
(laughter)

359
00:09:49,503 --> 00:09:50,644
I went into this acting class

360
00:09:50,644 --> 00:09:53,930
and it was totally terrifying.

361
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:54,912
I remember walking in

362
00:09:54,912 --> 00:09:55,988
and being like I don't know

363
00:09:55,988 --> 00:09:58,108
if this is what I'm supposed to do

364
00:09:58,108 --> 00:09:59,740
but I think this is what I want to do.

365
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,892
- It felt weird and right.

366
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:01,897
- [Jerry] It just, yeah.

367
00:10:01,897 --> 00:10:03,605
I just wanted to do it again.

368
00:10:03,605 --> 00:10:04,921
And I never stopped from that moment on.

369
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:06,271
I started doing extra work.

370
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:08,336
I was an extra in Oz on HBO.

371
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:11,177
I was an extra in the
pilot of Sex and the City.

372
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,010
- [Gary] What?

373
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:12,843
- Yes.

374
00:10:12,843 --> 00:10:15,360
Shot a club scene at Limelight in 1998.

375
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,193
I was in that scene.

376
00:10:16,193 --> 00:10:17,126
- Were you killing it in the background?

377
00:10:17,126 --> 00:10:18,200
You could barely see me.

378
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,179
I've never revealed what frame it is.

379
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:23,122
- [Gary] Fans, please find this

380
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,524
and tweet me with the screenshot.

381
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,357
Please find this.

382
00:10:26,357 --> 00:10:27,190
- [Jerry] Good luck.

383
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,023
It's really hidden, I
looked way different.

384
00:10:28,023 --> 00:10:29,462
But, I'll wrap it up quickly.

385
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,554
Right around there I knew I needed

386
00:10:31,554 --> 00:10:33,045
to venture out west.

387
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:35,303
'Cause at the time was
where the business was.

388
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:36,586
It's where the action was.

389
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:38,628
Moved out to LA.

390
00:10:38,628 --> 00:10:39,635
About four or five years into it

391
00:10:39,635 --> 00:10:41,743
I got cast in Entourage which--

392
00:10:41,743 --> 00:10:42,726
- [Gary] Worked out.

393
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:43,559
- It worked out.

394
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,706
(laughter)
Lasted eight seasons.

395
00:10:44,706 --> 00:10:47,191
And then, bounced around in movies

396
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:49,729
after that for a little
while trying to reinvent

397
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:52,274
because, you become that character.

398
00:10:52,274 --> 00:10:53,107
- I mean, let's get to the punchline.

399
00:10:53,107 --> 00:10:53,940
- [Jerry] I talked about
that at some point.

400
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,589
- I mean, let's talk
about for four seconds.

401
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,302
I mean, you do look different enough,

402
00:10:57,302 --> 00:10:58,751
that maybe you have a prayer

403
00:10:58,751 --> 00:10:59,924
of it not being as bad as it could be.

404
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:00,757
- [Jerry] Right.

405
00:11:00,757 --> 00:11:02,125
- But it must happen a lot

406
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,661
that people reference you as turtle.

407
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:06,665
- [Jerry] It certainly, in the moment.

408
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:07,556
- [Gary] At the time.

409
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:09,626
- In, say, season three of the show.

410
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:11,250
- [Gary] That's the only way
you were referenced in life.

411
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,083
- It was it.

412
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:12,916
- [Gary] Yeah.

413
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,077
- [Jerry] I do poke holes in
the whole typecasting theory

414
00:11:15,077 --> 00:11:16,660
because where I was going,

415
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,435
now I've been working on this
show power for five years.

416
00:11:19,435 --> 00:11:20,268
- [Gary] Yup.

417
00:11:20,268 --> 00:11:21,884
- I'm kind of typecast again.

418
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:23,169
Now, it's outside.

419
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:24,370
I just met a few people here.

420
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,878
We were like, Proctor, oh my God!

421
00:11:25,878 --> 00:11:26,711
That's my character.
- [Gary] Really?

422
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:27,544
- Yeah.

423
00:11:27,544 --> 00:11:28,856
So, it almost disproves
the theory, if typecast--

424
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,020
- [Gary] Bring those people to me.

425
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,853
Guys, fire those fuck-faces.

426
00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:33,686
(laughter)
- [Jerry] No.

427
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:34,519
- [Gary] Who?

428
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,427
- [Jerry] Don't tell!

429
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:37,260
- Anthony?

430
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,093
Bring him.

431
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:38,926
(laughter)

432
00:11:38,926 --> 00:11:40,908
I just inadvertently dimed someone out.

433
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:41,741
- [Gary] Yeah, go get Anthony right now.

434
00:11:41,741 --> 00:11:42,574
- No, no, no.

435
00:11:42,574 --> 00:11:43,407
Don't!

436
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:45,364
- [Gary] No, I'm firing him
right in his fucking face.

437
00:11:45,364 --> 00:11:46,730
Right now.

438
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,563
- Oh, guys.

439
00:11:47,563 --> 00:11:48,396
Someone's really going
to get this poor guy.

440
00:11:48,396 --> 00:11:49,229
- [Liz] She's actually getting him.

441
00:11:49,229 --> 00:11:50,506
- [Gary] This is real life.

442
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:52,122
This is what we do on the pod sessions.

443
00:11:52,122 --> 00:11:53,167
Episode three.

444
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:54,733
- [Jerry] He didn't say like.

445
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:55,923
He said Power more than Proctor.

446
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,256
- [Liz] Don't make him cry.

447
00:11:57,256 --> 00:11:58,514
- Dude.

448
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:01,055
- [Gary] You referenced
him as his new character?

449
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:01,888
- [Jerry] We talked about Power.

450
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:05,478
- [Gary] Do you know
about his OG character?

451
00:12:05,478 --> 00:12:06,311
- Of course.

452
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:08,311
- Okay, get out of here.

453
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,477
- [Jerry] I didn't mean that.

454
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:12,310
- It's okay.

455
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,701
He'll see what happens when
he watches the podcast.

456
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:15,094
- Where I was going with that

457
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:16,193
was in a way,

458
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,226
it kind of disproves typecasting as whole.

459
00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:19,059
Because if I was--

460
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:19,892
- [Gary] Yeah, if you can execute it.

461
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:20,725
- And only was turtle.

462
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:21,558
- [Gary] That's exactly right.

463
00:12:21,558 --> 00:12:23,243
- How do I get typecast again.

464
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,214
There's people who don't
know anything about Entourage

465
00:12:25,214 --> 00:12:26,375
and only know me from Power.

466
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,175
- [Gary] And so your goal is
to be typecast seven times.

467
00:12:28,175 --> 00:12:29,008
- [Jerry] As many times as possible.

468
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:29,841
- Good for you, buddy.

469
00:12:29,841 --> 00:12:30,674
- 'Cause all that means
is that I worked a lot.

470
00:12:30,674 --> 00:12:32,010
- [Gary] That's exactly right.

471
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,145
- And here I am.

472
00:12:33,145 --> 00:12:34,562
Back in New York.

473
00:12:35,776 --> 00:12:37,092
Still working and grinding.

474
00:12:37,092 --> 00:12:38,584
- [Gary] So what are you gonna do next?

475
00:12:38,584 --> 00:12:39,417
eSports.

476
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:40,250
You're doing a bunch of stuff,
we'll get all into that.

477
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,255
- You want some cool eSports stuff.

478
00:12:41,255 --> 00:12:42,088
- [Liz] He got married recently.

479
00:12:42,088 --> 00:12:43,047
- [Jerry] Just got married.

480
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:44,163
- Thank you @newyork.

481
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,544
- [Danielle] I was gonna
say that, too though.

482
00:12:45,544 --> 00:12:46,943
- [Gary] You referenced it earlier.

483
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:49,080
- Someone actually
decided to stay with this

484
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,502
for the rest of their life.

485
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:52,586
That did happen, shockingly enough.

486
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:54,002
- So life is good.

487
00:12:54,002 --> 00:12:56,127
- [Jerry] Life is good.

488
00:12:56,127 --> 00:12:57,596
- This is my favorite part of the show.

489
00:12:57,596 --> 00:12:58,829
I go right to it.

490
00:12:58,829 --> 00:12:59,712
- [Liz] I just have to say this.

491
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,253
This is a good group.

492
00:13:01,253 --> 00:13:02,086
- [Gary] Is this, Liz?

493
00:13:02,086 --> 00:13:03,671
- Yeah, this is a great group.

494
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:05,102
- [Gary] Why'd you dodge my question?

495
00:13:05,102 --> 00:13:06,035
- What question?

496
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:06,868
- [Gary] Yeah.
(laughter)

497
00:13:06,868 --> 00:13:08,234
- You're gonna ask him that question?

498
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:10,252
- [Gary] We know that answer.

499
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:11,496
I'm trying to teach the kids

500
00:13:11,496 --> 00:13:12,510
that you can actually make money

501
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,343
in influencer marketing.

502
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,250
- [Liz] Oh, totally.

503
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,364
- Alright.

504
00:13:16,364 --> 00:13:19,013
I want to know what you're
currently obsessed with.

505
00:13:19,013 --> 00:13:21,196
What is happening in culture

506
00:13:21,196 --> 00:13:22,029
or in your life

507
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:23,716
that you're obsessed with.

508
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:24,882
Now the last show,

509
00:13:24,882 --> 00:13:26,549
all three people went around

510
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:27,382
and made fucking

511
00:13:27,382 --> 00:13:28,215
- [Danielle] Bullshit answers.

512
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:30,310
Martin Luther King, Gandhi manifestos.

513
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,143
- [Danielle] Tyler summed it up.

514
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:31,976
- It was literally

515
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:33,143
peace, health,

516
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,774
world love.

517
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,316
I mean

518
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,744
you bought some weird pillow

519
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:39,577
at bed, bath and beyond,

520
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:42,101
'cause you slobber at night

521
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:44,141
and this pillow absorbs it

522
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:46,978
and now you're obsessed with this pillow.

523
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:48,911
Or you follow this new
weird instagram account.

524
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,404
Back to your world, Liz.

525
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:51,237
In my world.

526
00:13:51,237 --> 00:13:52,446
That has 600 followers,

527
00:13:52,446 --> 00:13:53,663
but you believe it's
gonna have four million.

528
00:13:53,663 --> 00:13:55,062
Or Jerry, you and I had this
meeting earlier and I said

529
00:13:55,062 --> 00:13:56,453
the hip hop artists, maybe.

530
00:13:56,453 --> 00:13:57,620
- [Jerry] Yes.

531
00:13:58,877 --> 00:14:01,533
What are you currently obsessed with.

532
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:03,473
Jerry you go first, we're
going the other way around.

533
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:04,565
- I was expecting it.

534
00:14:04,565 --> 00:14:05,398
You know what?

535
00:14:05,398 --> 00:14:07,189
I'm ready for it.
- [Gary] Go ahead.

536
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:08,614
- I promise this is not a plug.

537
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:09,932
I am obsessed with gaming.

538
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,290
- [Gary] But that's okay
'cause D has been plugging

539
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,123
all day.

540
00:14:12,123 --> 00:14:15,795
- With gaming and
eSports and I'm currently

541
00:14:15,795 --> 00:14:18,688
a scout and a consultant for the Knicks

542
00:14:18,688 --> 00:14:20,779
on their gaming squad.

543
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:23,387
And that requires me
being on Twitch, day in,

544
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:24,346
day night,

545
00:14:24,346 --> 00:14:25,630
scouting these players.

546
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,017
It's like the closest I can come

547
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:27,850
to being a part of a
real sports franchise.

548
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,132
- [Gary] So, you're
literally looking at Twitch.

549
00:14:29,132 --> 00:14:30,020
- [Jerry] I'm scouting.

550
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,853
- And you're scouting.

551
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:31,686
- [Jerry] Yes.

552
00:14:31,686 --> 00:14:32,861
You're like, I think Ricky in Minnesota,

553
00:14:32,861 --> 00:14:34,284
we should sign him.

554
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:35,194
He's a good player.

555
00:14:35,194 --> 00:14:36,027
- [Jerry] Well, draft him.

556
00:14:36,027 --> 00:14:38,379
That's what the cool thing
is about the 2K leagues.

557
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:39,323
I call them kids.

558
00:14:39,323 --> 00:14:40,809
- [Gary] Oh, this is for the 2K league.

559
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:42,402
- This is for the MBA 2K league.

560
00:14:42,402 --> 00:14:43,878
- [Gary] How good are you at 2K?

561
00:14:43,878 --> 00:14:45,194
- [Jerry] I'm pretty good.

562
00:14:45,194 --> 00:14:47,000
But I can't touch

563
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,841
some of these guys who have
been playing professionally.

564
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:52,545
- How good are you at Bubble Hockey?

565
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:54,300
- I could be taken in Bubble Hockey.

566
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,807
- [Gary] Okay, we'll do that

567
00:14:55,807 --> 00:14:57,349
- I could be taken in Bubble Hockey.

568
00:14:57,349 --> 00:14:58,665
Only 'cause it's been a while.

569
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,290
- [Gary] Liz, Dani.

570
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,148
Dani, you don't know what--

571
00:15:01,148 --> 00:15:02,280
- [Danielle] I don't know what
you guys are talking about.

572
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,113
- You've never seen the
hockey game with the big.

573
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:03,946
- [Danielle] Jodie, do you?

574
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:04,779
- [Jodie] I don't know.

575
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,833
I am obsessed with sports.

576
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:06,930
I don't know what bubble hockey is.

577
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,948
- Okay, Bubble Hockey is the
machine that's in a bubble

578
00:15:08,948 --> 00:15:10,530
and you see it in the Arcade
and people play hockey.

579
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,421
- Oh, that's what it's called?

580
00:15:11,421 --> 00:15:12,254
Yes, I know what that is.

581
00:15:12,254 --> 00:15:13,087
- Of course.

582
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:13,920
- [Danielle] Oh, you guys
are that obsessed with that?

583
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,896
- 87% of the brain comes through.

584
00:15:15,896 --> 00:15:16,729
Alright, Jerry.

585
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:17,562
Hold on.

586
00:15:17,562 --> 00:15:19,276
He's obsessed with Twitch, eSports.

587
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:20,559
But actually, in specific.

588
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,392
- [Jerry] Scouting

589
00:15:21,392 --> 00:15:22,225
- [Gary] Scouting for 2K.

590
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:23,299
- [Jerry] Yes.

591
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:24,925
- Who the best player you've seen?

592
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,147
Or have you not been
able to draft them yet?

593
00:15:26,147 --> 00:15:27,213
- No.

594
00:15:27,213 --> 00:15:29,124
So what will happen
similar to the real MBA

595
00:15:29,124 --> 00:15:31,305
is they will announce a lottery order.

596
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,702
And then we will all sit in the war room

597
00:15:32,702 --> 00:15:34,064
and draft these guys.

598
00:15:34,064 --> 00:15:35,562
And they will move to the city

599
00:15:35,562 --> 00:15:36,395
and get paid to be a pro gamer.

600
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,596
- [Gary] When somebody is great at 2K

601
00:15:38,596 --> 00:15:40,681
is there an advantage for them to use

602
00:15:40,681 --> 00:15:42,050
the Warriors or the Cavs?

603
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,241
- [Jerry] See, here's the thing.

604
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:44,666
They use their own created player.

605
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,792
That's why the game has changed.

606
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:46,735
- [Gary] I see.

607
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:48,018
- So it's no longer like,

608
00:15:48,018 --> 00:15:49,359
I'm gonna play you.

609
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:50,732
To answer you're question, though.

610
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:51,798
Yes, if you do it that way.

611
00:15:51,798 --> 00:15:52,631
The Warriors are
obviously, major advantage.

612
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:53,605
- [Gary] Sure, of course; but.

613
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:55,310
But these guys are creating
their own player squatting up.

614
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,668
- [Gary] All of them?

615
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:58,803
- And they're playing five versus five.

616
00:15:58,803 --> 00:15:59,636
- [Gary] Actual guys.

617
00:15:59,636 --> 00:16:01,294
And do they have to be themselves?

618
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,421
Or can they create a seven foot nine XXXX.

619
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,254
- [Jerry] They can absolutely do that.

620
00:16:05,254 --> 00:16:06,087
- But then they become
vulnerable in other ways.

621
00:16:06,087 --> 00:16:06,920
- [Jerry] Exactly.

622
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,753
I love where we're going.

623
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:08,586
Liz.

624
00:16:08,586 --> 00:16:09,419
Sorry, Jerry.

625
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:10,252
You're done.

626
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:11,127
- Scouting.

627
00:16:11,127 --> 00:16:12,810
- [Liz] Do you want more surface answers?

628
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,568
- [Gary] You've been overthinking.

629
00:16:14,568 --> 00:16:15,559
- I know.

630
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,584
- Did you talk to a PR
person before you came here?

631
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:18,417
- [Liz] No.

632
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:20,217
- [Gary] You're hedging.

633
00:16:20,217 --> 00:16:21,967
You're name is hedge.

634
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:24,381
No.

635
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,170
My literal example

636
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,003
was literally a fucking pillow.

637
00:16:28,003 --> 00:16:28,836
- Alright, well.

638
00:16:28,836 --> 00:16:29,669
- [Gary] Liz.

639
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:31,374
- I don't want to get to
the whole Gandhi thing.

640
00:16:31,374 --> 00:16:32,554
But, I'm really interested
in learning more

641
00:16:32,554 --> 00:16:34,949
about the psychology of marketing.

642
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:36,531
- [Gary] Okay, keep going.

643
00:16:36,531 --> 00:16:39,864
- And, I just think we're
so inundated with brands

644
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:40,963
on a daily basis.

645
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:41,796
And the consumption of media.

646
00:16:41,796 --> 00:16:42,905
- [Gary] And just overall information.

647
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:44,484
- Consumption of media, information.

648
00:16:44,484 --> 00:16:45,317
What have you.

649
00:16:45,317 --> 00:16:47,251
And so, learning how brands
can break through it.

650
00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:48,479
Not even brands, but people.

651
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:49,312
Influencers.

652
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:50,145
- [Gary] Anyone.

653
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:50,978
- Anyone.

654
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:52,384
- [Gary] Do you think
that you're intuitive?

655
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:53,217
- I believe so.

656
00:16:53,217 --> 00:16:54,370
- [Gary] I think so too.

657
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,969
- Just in our one meeting.

658
00:16:55,969 --> 00:16:56,973
And now, just some of the things.

659
00:16:56,973 --> 00:16:58,488
I think that's a good space for you to go.

660
00:16:58,488 --> 00:16:59,684
I think that's my space.

661
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:01,140
I know nothing about--

662
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,000
- [Liz] It's fascinating, though.

663
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,708
- What are you laughing at?

664
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:05,540
Okay.

665
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,148
(laughter)

666
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:11,065
- [Gary] No more siblings
on this kind of show.

667
00:17:12,182 --> 00:17:14,190
No, but I think it's a good space for you.

668
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,772
Because thinking about...

669
00:17:15,772 --> 00:17:17,973
A lot of people read that
Instagram raised money.

670
00:17:17,973 --> 00:17:18,806
- [Liz] Totally.

671
00:17:18,807 --> 00:17:20,380
- That didn't take them
to the place of, hey

672
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,012
I can make the parallel

673
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:23,057
of once there's attention here

674
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:24,122
that translates to print.

675
00:17:24,122 --> 00:17:24,954
- [Liz] Right.

676
00:17:24,954 --> 00:17:26,429
I think that's the only thing I had.

677
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,912
Using the sports reference.

678
00:17:27,912 --> 00:17:29,445
I think I'm Mariano Rivera.

679
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:31,589
All I think I have is
intuitive understanding

680
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:32,540
of people's behaviors

681
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,321
and then I play that
playbook over and over.

682
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:37,404
Then I learn the context of Twitch.

683
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:39,489
I'm gonna have a huge Twitch channel

684
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:40,572
in 14 months.

685
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:43,495
Because once I put in the time

686
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,454
to understand the context, it's game over.

687
00:17:45,454 --> 00:17:46,426
- [Liz] Totally.

688
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:47,401
- That's gonna be dope.

689
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,112
- [Danielle] Don't you want
to hang out with him everyday.

690
00:17:49,112 --> 00:17:49,945
- Yeah.

691
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:50,778
- [Gary] Does that go through your mind?

692
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,611
- Brain suck his ideas.

693
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:52,869
- I better be on that Twitch channel.

694
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:53,702
- Yeah, at a different level.

695
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:54,535
- [Gary] Which level?

696
00:17:54,535 --> 00:17:55,535
(laughter)

697
00:17:55,535 --> 00:17:57,289
I'm the female version.

698
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:58,587
- [Gary] As a tag team?

699
00:17:58,587 --> 00:17:59,420
- Yeah.

700
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,253
- [Gary] You're like champions.

701
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:01,766
Alright, so that is what
you're thinking about.

702
00:18:01,766 --> 00:18:02,599
So are you--

703
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:03,432
- [Liz] Yeah, I think
it's very interesting.

704
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:04,394
- Obviously, I know we got to talk

705
00:18:04,394 --> 00:18:06,245
I'll sum up the audience.

706
00:18:06,245 --> 00:18:07,601
You have this incredible situation

707
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:09,183
where you're smart and hard work

708
00:18:09,183 --> 00:18:11,111
put you in this incredible spot.

709
00:18:11,111 --> 00:18:11,944
- [Liz] I also had a great team.

710
00:18:11,944 --> 00:18:12,976
- As a young entrepreneur.

711
00:18:12,976 --> 00:18:13,809
- [Gary] Right?

712
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:14,642
Absolutely.

713
00:18:14,642 --> 00:18:15,475
But, you're now in a place

714
00:18:15,475 --> 00:18:16,642
where you can be thoughtful

715
00:18:16,642 --> 00:18:17,758
about you're next step or two or three.

716
00:18:17,758 --> 00:18:18,733
- [Liz] Absolutely.

717
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:20,017
- And so that's where
you're putting your energy

718
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,779
in trying to understand
where that translates.

719
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:23,248
Have you started thinking about voice?

720
00:18:23,248 --> 00:18:25,882
Like Alexa and all that?

721
00:18:25,882 --> 00:18:26,715
- I have.

722
00:18:26,715 --> 00:18:27,729
I just need to understand a bit more.

723
00:18:27,729 --> 00:18:28,562
- [Danielle] You're obsessed.

724
00:18:28,562 --> 00:18:29,395
Careful.

725
00:18:29,395 --> 00:18:30,745
- I'm really obsessed.

726
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:31,578
- [Liz] Crazy.

727
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:32,411
- I just know it.

728
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,244
It's all about friction.

729
00:18:33,244 --> 00:18:34,077
- [Danielle] Right.

730
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:35,160
- Here's what I think.

731
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,144
All three of you and everybody listening.

732
00:18:36,144 --> 00:18:39,242
Put an Alexa or a google
home in your bathroom

733
00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:41,227
and learn that you can use it.

734
00:18:41,227 --> 00:18:42,060
- Jerry.

735
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,832
- I just got it for Christmas
and I had it returned.

736
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,933
Yeah.
- [Liz] You don't like it.

737
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:46,908
- It's not that I don't like it!

738
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:47,783
I just...

739
00:18:47,783 --> 00:18:49,449
(moaning)

740
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:50,982
- Do it with voice.

741
00:18:50,982 --> 00:18:51,815
- Why did you need the 30 dollars so bad?

742
00:18:51,815 --> 00:18:53,098
- [Danielle] Let's talk about it.

743
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:53,931
- [Jerry] No, no.

744
00:18:53,931 --> 00:18:56,706
Meaning, I'm never gonna use this.

745
00:18:56,706 --> 00:18:57,539
I don't want it.

746
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:58,516
- [Gary] You know who
you sound like right now.

747
00:18:58,516 --> 00:18:59,349
- Like an idiot.

748
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:00,182
- [Gary] Yes.

749
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,015
- Yes, I truly agree.

750
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,291
- [Gary] We can literally
recall this clip,

751
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,599
we're filming it right now.

752
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,840
In six years, we're gonna
show this exact clip

753
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,148
and it's gonna be great

754
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:08,532
because you're gonna be starring

755
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:10,482
in Apple's home pod's commercial.

756
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,164
And we're gonna be, this fucking guy.

757
00:19:12,164 --> 00:19:12,997
(laughter)

758
00:19:12,997 --> 00:19:14,093
- Hi, I'm Jerry Ferrara.

759
00:19:14,093 --> 00:19:15,542
Do you know what you need in your home?

760
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:16,992
- [Gary] An Apple home pod.

761
00:19:16,992 --> 00:19:17,975
'Cause it's the bet.

762
00:19:17,975 --> 00:19:18,999
No, here's why.

763
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:21,716
When people first got the iPhone

764
00:19:21,716 --> 00:19:23,882
they didn't understand the power.

765
00:19:23,882 --> 00:19:25,384
You don't realize the apps

766
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:27,524
that are gonna be built
on top of these products

767
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:29,338
that are gonna completely
change your life.

768
00:19:29,338 --> 00:19:30,417
And more importantly,

769
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:32,583
the reason I like the bathroom move

770
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,880
is I do think a lot of
people think about their day

771
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,713
early on.

772
00:19:35,713 --> 00:19:37,674
A lot runs through your
mind in the bathroom.

773
00:19:37,674 --> 00:19:38,507
And so, hey what's my calendar today.

774
00:19:38,507 --> 00:19:40,757
Hey, remind me to buy this.

775
00:19:43,991 --> 00:19:45,932
I think about 700.

776
00:19:45,932 --> 00:19:47,991
By thinking about my upcoming day.

777
00:19:47,991 --> 00:19:50,289
Without even looking at my
calendar, in the shower.

778
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,841
I think about people I
need to connect with.

779
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:53,088
Things that I need to get done.

780
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:54,943
The amount of things that
run through people's minds

781
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:55,776
of to do.

782
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:56,609
- [Liz] In the bathroom.

783
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:58,208
- You have to understand
how the Alexa works.

784
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,253
Alexa, make sure I see D Rock later.

785
00:20:00,253 --> 00:20:01,086
You know?

786
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:02,335
Stuff like that is intense.

787
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,335
Right Alexa?

788
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:06,142
- I think she passed out.

789
00:20:06,142 --> 00:20:07,534
- [Gary] She's just not there yet.

790
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:09,617
- Alexa, are you alright?

791
00:20:10,454 --> 00:20:11,287
- [Alexa] I came down

792
00:20:11,287 --> 00:20:13,195
with the case of the acting bug.

793
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:14,329
(laughter)

794
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:17,191
- [Alexa] Close system, for now.

795
00:20:17,191 --> 00:20:18,024
- What?

796
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:18,943
- [Gary] I'll tell you what happened.

797
00:20:18,943 --> 00:20:20,260
I feel she just said
something to me right there.

798
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,093
- [Gary] She did.

799
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:21,926
She did, Jer.

800
00:20:21,926 --> 00:20:22,759
This is what's happening.

801
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:23,592
Alexa is actually is listening.

802
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:24,425
- [Jerry] I'm scared.

803
00:20:24,425 --> 00:20:29,234
And referenced your acting
career in her answer just now.

804
00:20:29,234 --> 00:20:30,067
I'm joking.

805
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:31,150
- [Liz] What?

806
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:33,740
- Alexa, before I go

807
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,072
I want to know what you're obsessed with.

808
00:20:37,072 --> 00:20:37,905
- [Alexa] Sorry.

809
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,005
I don't know that.

810
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:39,838
- [Gary] See?

811
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:40,671
But soon.

812
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:41,654
- This is the problem with Alexa.

813
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:42,537
- This is the current

814
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:43,919
short-term problem with Alexa.

815
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,532
And if you don't get
used to talking to her

816
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:47,655
by the time she's got it all figured out

817
00:20:47,655 --> 00:20:49,116
you are all going to be behind.

818
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:52,024
- [Liz] But even voice authentication

819
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:54,601
will be more powerful
than image recognition.

820
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:56,727
- [Gary] Guys, voice is the fucking jam.

821
00:20:56,727 --> 00:20:58,672
- [Danielle] Can we leave with Alexas.

822
00:20:58,672 --> 00:21:00,052
Can we get little to-go bags?

823
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:01,360
- [Gary] We might have some.

824
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,501
- [Jerry] I'm gonna sell it on the street.

825
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:03,534
- Jerry you like that?

826
00:21:03,534 --> 00:21:04,367
- [Gary] Jerry sold his for six bucks.

827
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:05,200
- You'll see me downtown.

828
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,033
I got Alexas.

829
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:07,424
- [Gary] Jerry sold his for six bucks.

830
00:21:07,424 --> 00:21:09,373
(laughter)

831
00:21:09,373 --> 00:21:11,094
Why did you need?

832
00:21:11,094 --> 00:21:12,882
Alright; what are you
currently obsessed with?

833
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:13,960
- [Liz] Oh also,

834
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,312
I'm obsessed with those Instagram accounts

835
00:21:15,312 --> 00:21:17,479
where they're icing cakes.

836
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:19,745
Have you ever seen those accounts?

837
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:20,994
They're mesmerizing.

838
00:21:20,994 --> 00:21:21,827
- [Gary] Which is you're favorite?

839
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:22,660
Do you know?

840
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,493
- [Liz] I don't know.

841
00:21:23,493 --> 00:21:24,326
Or you know image-based?

842
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:25,159
- [Liz] They're all weird.

843
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:25,992
- So none of them did a good job

844
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:27,959
branding enough to make you a member.

845
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,099
- [Tyler] With a squishy?

846
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:32,045
- Yeah, and they cut things.

847
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:32,878
Just look.

848
00:21:34,816 --> 00:21:36,363
- You're talking about
something different, Ty.

849
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:38,376
- [Danielle] I'm obsessed
with a few things.

850
00:21:38,376 --> 00:21:39,829
The short answer, Shazam.

851
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:43,104
And it kind of ties into the voice

852
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:44,271
and digital...

853
00:21:45,865 --> 00:21:46,972
- [Gary] You love Shazam.

854
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,197
- I love Shazam.

855
00:21:48,197 --> 00:21:49,863
- [Gary] Because you want
to know what song that is.

856
00:21:49,863 --> 00:21:53,438
- Any time I walk into
a restaurant bathroom,

857
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:57,285
or a dinner, or a gas
station, or a showroom.

858
00:21:57,285 --> 00:21:58,576
- [Gary] Let's talk about the last time

859
00:21:58,576 --> 00:22:00,610
you walked into a gas station.

860
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,467
No, let's focus on this part.

861
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:03,401
Can we?

862
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:07,117
Tell us that story real quick, please.

863
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,100
- [Liz] Here we go.

864
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,232
- Let me think when I
went into a gas station.

865
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:11,189
(laughter)

866
00:22:11,189 --> 00:22:12,522
- Alright, let's segue.

867
00:22:12,522 --> 00:22:13,780
- [Danielle] But, anyways.

868
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,613
I'm obsessed with Shazam.

869
00:22:14,613 --> 00:22:15,988
It's how I discovered
some of my favorite songs

870
00:22:15,988 --> 00:22:16,846
in the entire world.

871
00:22:16,846 --> 00:22:18,689
- What is your favorite
song you ever discovered

872
00:22:18,689 --> 00:22:19,522
from Shazam.

873
00:22:19,522 --> 00:22:20,355
- [Danielle] Well, right now

874
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:23,516
I'm obsessed with, I'm
gonna botch his name,

875
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:24,349
Ludovico Einaudi.

876
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:25,182
- [Gary] Okay.

877
00:22:25,182 --> 00:22:26,689
- Obsessed.

878
00:22:26,689 --> 00:22:27,522
Memories?

879
00:22:27,522 --> 00:22:28,355
- [Gary] Yes, I got it.

880
00:22:28,355 --> 00:22:29,188
- Okay.

881
00:22:29,188 --> 00:22:30,021
- [Gary] Yeah, we're all there.

882
00:22:30,021 --> 00:22:30,854
(laughter)

883
00:22:30,854 --> 00:22:31,954
We're just waiting for the next part.

884
00:22:31,954 --> 00:22:33,719
- There's a song called Luhya.

885
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,612
L-U-H-Y-A

886
00:22:35,612 --> 00:22:37,219
- [Gary] Okay.

887
00:22:37,219 --> 00:22:39,046
- I forget who it is.

888
00:22:39,046 --> 00:22:40,689
I actually Instagramed the other day

889
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:41,655
in my insta story,

890
00:22:41,655 --> 00:22:43,150
and they only have three
thousand Instagram followers.

891
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,524
I think they're going to be massive.

892
00:22:44,524 --> 00:22:45,730
I'm also obsessed Jain.

893
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:46,702
- What's their handle?

894
00:22:46,702 --> 00:22:47,984
I want to put this down.

895
00:22:47,984 --> 00:22:49,496
'Cause I think you're
gonna with this game.

896
00:22:49,496 --> 00:22:50,858
And we will also clip this,

897
00:22:50,858 --> 00:22:51,691
recall it for you,

898
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:52,524
send it to you.

899
00:22:52,524 --> 00:22:53,357
You can post it.

900
00:22:53,357 --> 00:22:54,323
And you'll be amazing.

901
00:22:54,323 --> 00:22:57,068
And Jerry will be a hypocrite.

902
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:58,744
- And there's a song called Porto.

903
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,542
I'm gonna send you guys a playlist

904
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:01,633
just for this crew.

905
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:03,686
- Why don't you start a
Spotify playlist right now,

906
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:05,036
around the brand.

907
00:23:05,036 --> 00:23:07,686
Which I think is a huge
marketing strategy.

908
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:11,634
My Monday to Monday playlist
is killing it for me.

909
00:23:11,634 --> 00:23:13,068
- [Danielle] Why don't you feature it?

910
00:23:13,068 --> 00:23:13,901
Gary, Gary.

911
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:15,042
Why don't you feature it?

912
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:16,250
- [Gary] Why don't you
feature you're song on it?

913
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,831
- Yeah, 'cause you have a
way bigger reach than me.

914
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:18,664
- [Gary] No, no.

915
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:19,497
But look.

916
00:23:19,497 --> 00:23:20,963
We're gonna use this audience,

917
00:23:20,963 --> 00:23:21,796
and now you're gonna start one.

918
00:23:21,796 --> 00:23:22,629
- [Danielle] You guys hear this?

919
00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:23,604
- [Jerry] I would like a playlist.

920
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:24,437
- Alright, I'm gonna make you one day.

921
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:25,270
- Send me a playlist.

922
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,103
- [Gary] Can you make a commitment?

923
00:23:26,103 --> 00:23:27,361
You're both in here.

924
00:23:27,361 --> 00:23:28,323
Right?

925
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,938
You guys make the decisions.

926
00:23:29,938 --> 00:23:31,331
- [Danielle] Yeah, you're looking at us.

927
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:34,087
- Can you guys confirm that by tonight

928
00:23:34,087 --> 00:23:35,112
your brand

929
00:23:35,112 --> 00:23:36,603
will have a Spotify playlist?

930
00:23:36,603 --> 00:23:37,520
- [Jodie] It'll be by tomorrow.

931
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,580
We have a big dinner tonight.

932
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,891
We have a lot to do after.

933
00:23:39,891 --> 00:23:40,931
- Your company is going out of business.

934
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:41,764
- [Danielle] Which, by the way,

935
00:23:41,764 --> 00:23:42,597
you are invited to.

936
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:43,660
She's coming, too.

937
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,962
And you and your wife are welcome to come.

938
00:23:44,962 --> 00:23:45,795
- [Gary] Tyler.

939
00:23:45,795 --> 00:23:47,192
Do you know this part about my life?

940
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,523
I get invited to so much awesome shit.

941
00:23:48,523 --> 00:23:49,356
- [Danielle] I know.

942
00:23:49,356 --> 00:23:50,240
- Tyler deletes it.

943
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,073
- [Tyler] That's not true.

944
00:23:51,073 --> 00:23:51,906
- [Danielle] Tyler.

945
00:23:51,906 --> 00:23:53,347
I specifically said, can Gary come.

946
00:23:53,347 --> 00:23:54,774
- Why can't I never go to anything?

947
00:23:54,774 --> 00:23:56,635
- [Tyler] 'Cause you got other shit to do.

948
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:57,949
- [Danielle] Can Gary come?

949
00:23:57,949 --> 00:23:58,969
- [Jerry] Fair enough.

950
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:01,219
(laughter)

951
00:24:02,338 --> 00:24:03,963
- [Danielle] The other
thing that I'm obsessed with

952
00:24:03,963 --> 00:24:04,796
besides Shazam.

953
00:24:04,796 --> 00:24:05,629
I'm gonna do the playlist

954
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:07,912
by tomorrow.
- Go ahead

955
00:24:07,912 --> 00:24:08,745
- Vintage.

956
00:24:08,745 --> 00:24:09,578
All things vintage

957
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:10,577
and getting back to our roots

958
00:24:10,577 --> 00:24:11,718
and old world, and story telling.

959
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:13,834
- [Gary] Our roots of the 1990's.

960
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:14,667
- Yeah, like in 1900's.

961
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:15,659
- [Gary] 'Cause you're so fucking young.

962
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:16,492
We oughta get back to our roots.

963
00:24:16,492 --> 00:24:17,325
- [Liz] Dani find some cool stuff.

964
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:18,567
- [Gary] 1989.

965
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:19,700
- [Jerry] The late 1900's.

966
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,608
- [Gary] Oh, Victorian.

967
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:21,649
- The twenties, the thirties.

968
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:22,482
- Yeah.

969
00:24:22,482 --> 00:24:23,473
- When things were much simpler

970
00:24:23,473 --> 00:24:24,756
and women were wearing
corsets, and their hair.

971
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:27,073
- [Gary] So are you gonna
start rocking corsets.

972
00:24:27,073 --> 00:24:28,124
- [Danielle] Yeah, actually.

973
00:24:28,124 --> 00:24:29,124
- [Liz] We already do it.

974
00:24:29,124 --> 00:24:30,805
- [Gary] But, I mean for real.

975
00:24:30,805 --> 00:24:34,746
Not in like a
pseudo-interpreted 2018 world.

976
00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:37,086
I mean some straight 1920's gangster shit.

977
00:24:37,086 --> 00:24:38,500
- I reinterpret.

978
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,673
- [Gary] I knew that you reinterpret.

979
00:24:39,673 --> 00:24:43,126
- But what I'm really excited
about is the usage of vintage

980
00:24:43,126 --> 00:24:47,189
and things of the past
as a means to story-tell.

981
00:24:47,189 --> 00:24:48,884
- [Gary] I agree.

982
00:24:48,884 --> 00:24:50,191
In fashion, I'm sick of everything.

983
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:51,090
I'm sick of Instagram or fast fashion.

984
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,090
- [Gary] But it's 'cause your cool.

985
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:52,923
- Thank you.

986
00:24:52,923 --> 00:24:55,481
- [Gary] You're biggest problem
is you're absurdly cool.

987
00:24:55,481 --> 00:24:56,314
- [Danielle] Say it louder.

988
00:24:56,314 --> 00:24:57,147
- Yeah.

989
00:24:57,147 --> 00:25:00,017
You're biggest issue is that
you're outrageously cool.

990
00:25:00,017 --> 00:25:01,181
- [Danielle] Thank you, Gary.

991
00:25:01,181 --> 00:25:04,530
- Actually, on a very complementary kick,

992
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,799
you might be the coolest person I know.

993
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,632
- Jerry.

994
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:09,897
Should I walk out now.

995
00:25:09,897 --> 00:25:11,657
- [Jerry] Alright, Gary.

996
00:25:11,657 --> 00:25:13,171
- Alexa, did you hear that.

997
00:25:13,171 --> 00:25:15,483
- I know we met 48
minutes ago, but alright.

998
00:25:15,483 --> 00:25:16,537
- Alexa did you hear that?

999
00:25:16,537 --> 00:25:20,212
- [Gary] Alexa, who's the coolest person?

1000
00:25:20,212 --> 00:25:22,879
Alexa, who's the coolest person?

1001
00:25:24,318 --> 00:25:26,885
- [Alexa] I like whomever
is talking to me.

1002
00:25:26,885 --> 00:25:27,718
- [Gary] I was talking to her.

1003
00:25:27,718 --> 00:25:28,551
- That was me.

1004
00:25:28,551 --> 00:25:29,384
- [Gary] Alexa is very smart.

1005
00:25:29,384 --> 00:25:30,217
- That was me, Alexa.

1006
00:25:30,217 --> 00:25:31,050
- [Gary] I think it was me.

1007
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,033
- It's Danielle Snyder from Dannijo.

1008
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:34,036
Thank you so much sweetheart.

1009
00:25:34,036 --> 00:25:35,053
I love you, too.

1010
00:25:35,053 --> 00:25:36,661
- Are you gonna become
best friends with Alexa?

1011
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:37,494
- [Danielle] Yeah.

1012
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,327
If you think she's that great.

1013
00:25:38,327 --> 00:25:40,170
- [Gary] I think you should
start an Instagram account

1014
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,478
called your name and Alexa.

1015
00:25:42,478 --> 00:25:43,311
- [Danielle] Danielle and Alexa?

1016
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:44,144
- Yes.

1017
00:25:44,144 --> 00:25:45,516
And you should post three times a day

1018
00:25:45,516 --> 00:25:47,741
of you and your adventures with Alexa.

1019
00:25:47,741 --> 00:25:48,585
(laughter)

1020
00:25:48,585 --> 00:25:49,516
- [Jerry] I don't know if Alexa likes it.

1021
00:25:49,516 --> 00:25:50,657
- [Danielle] Alexa we're
gonna make it this afternoon.

1022
00:25:50,657 --> 00:25:51,490
Gary's team is gonna help me.

1023
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,323
- [Gary] Can you commit?

1024
00:25:52,323 --> 00:25:53,905
No, no.

1025
00:25:53,905 --> 00:25:55,379
You've gotta learn how
to do this yourself.

1026
00:25:55,379 --> 00:25:56,336
- [Danielle] I know, but Gary.

1027
00:25:56,336 --> 00:25:58,219
- We'll give you the playbook.

1028
00:25:58,219 --> 00:26:00,102
I actually think one of the
biggest Instagram accounts

1029
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:02,937
sitting and waiting is somebody's
person's name and Alexa,

1030
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:04,629
like these joint accounts.

1031
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:06,926
There is something incredibly
creative that can be done.

1032
00:26:06,926 --> 00:26:07,759
- [Danielle] Conversations.

1033
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:09,368
- [Liz] Scoop that up the second.

1034
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:10,504
- [Gary] Well, that's
why putting out there.

1035
00:26:10,504 --> 00:26:12,451
And here's where often times.

1036
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:13,701
Alexa, shut up.

1037
00:26:15,294 --> 00:26:16,931
I say it because in a lot of my talks

1038
00:26:16,931 --> 00:26:18,639
I always say that 99%.

1039
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:19,978
The reason I give away all my best advice

1040
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,727
is 'cause 99% of you
are not gonna take it.

1041
00:26:22,727 --> 00:26:24,810
The reason I just did
this last little skit

1042
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,960
was in a week I'm gonna go
look how many people did it

1043
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,816
and the reality is 1% of
this listening audience.

1044
00:26:29,816 --> 00:26:32,054
- [Danielle] Tyler is making
Danielle and Alexa right now.

1045
00:26:32,054 --> 00:26:32,894
That's what he's doing.

1046
00:26:32,894 --> 00:26:33,727
Thank you.

1047
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:34,560
- [Gary] Does Tyler work for you?

1048
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,410
I've always had this
secretly weird concern

1049
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,292
this has been going on.

1050
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:39,125
- [Danielle] Tyler and I.

1051
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:39,958
- [Jerry] He's a double agent.

1052
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:40,791
- [Danielle] We're like family.

1053
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:42,646
- [Gary] I feel like
this has been going on.

1054
00:26:42,646 --> 00:26:43,524
- [Danielle] We're a family.

1055
00:26:43,524 --> 00:26:45,428
- By the way, all your people.

1056
00:26:45,428 --> 00:26:47,697
Ever since the first day I came here.

1057
00:26:47,697 --> 00:26:48,530
Jerry.

1058
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,976
- [Jerry] You hired me outside.

1059
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:50,876
She just hired me before we were in here.

1060
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:52,041
- [Gary] It's a start.

1061
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:53,508
- I told her I want to pivot out of acting

1062
00:26:53,508 --> 00:26:54,341
and she hired me.

1063
00:26:54,341 --> 00:26:55,394
- Liz and I are working together.

1064
00:26:55,394 --> 00:26:56,386
Jerry.

1065
00:26:56,386 --> 00:26:57,869
- [Gary] Liz.

1066
00:26:57,869 --> 00:26:59,402
Let's talk about the Super Bowl.

1067
00:26:59,402 --> 00:27:00,235
It just happened.

1068
00:27:00,235 --> 00:27:02,743
Tell me about your Super Bowl experience.

1069
00:27:02,743 --> 00:27:03,991
- I went on a plane.

1070
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:05,088
So I didn't even watch it.

1071
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,921
- [Gary] Okay, so let's talk.

1072
00:27:05,921 --> 00:27:07,412
- I missed the half-time show.

1073
00:27:07,412 --> 00:27:08,245
- [Gary] The Justin Timberlake thing.

1074
00:27:08,245 --> 00:27:09,078
- Yeah.

1075
00:27:09,078 --> 00:27:10,844
- Okay, so let's talk about this.

1076
00:27:10,844 --> 00:27:12,153
The Super Bowl.

1077
00:27:12,153 --> 00:27:13,451
You were on the plane the whole time.

1078
00:27:13,451 --> 00:27:14,643
- A majority of it.

1079
00:27:14,643 --> 00:27:15,699
- Where were you before you landed?

1080
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:16,902
- [Liz] I was in Los Angeles.

1081
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:17,797
- [Gary] And you came to New York.

1082
00:27:17,797 --> 00:27:18,970
- And I came to San Francisco.

1083
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:19,803
- [Gary] Oh interesting.

1084
00:27:19,803 --> 00:27:22,410
Now, that was a five second flight.

1085
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,243
- Oh man.

1086
00:27:23,243 --> 00:27:24,076
(laughter)
- [Gary] It's a short flight.

1087
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:24,909
- There was.

1088
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:25,742
- [Gary] Right?

1089
00:27:25,742 --> 00:27:26,575
- But it was right at when it was.

1090
00:27:26,575 --> 00:27:27,408
- [Gary] So tell me about this.

1091
00:27:27,408 --> 00:27:28,241
Who else was on the plane?

1092
00:27:28,241 --> 00:27:29,266
And was it weird?

1093
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:31,295
Because you knew the whole
country was doing one thing

1094
00:27:31,295 --> 00:27:33,210
and you and these 200 weird
people were in the air.

1095
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,460
(laughter)

1096
00:27:36,477 --> 00:27:37,570
But I also couldn't watch it
on You Tube TV on my phone.

1097
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,862
- [Gary] So, you know how the pilots

1098
00:27:39,862 --> 00:27:41,712
with big sporting events
do this stuff where they

1099
00:27:41,712 --> 00:27:42,927
update, Eagles seven.

1100
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:43,760
- [Liz] Yes.

1101
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,593
- Were they doing that?

1102
00:27:44,593 --> 00:27:45,692
- And with half the plane be like yay

1103
00:27:45,692 --> 00:27:46,759
and the other half be bleh.

1104
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:48,317
- I'm not sure I had my
headphones in the whole time.

1105
00:27:48,317 --> 00:27:50,567
What were you listening to?

1106
00:27:52,033 --> 00:27:54,308
Probably John Mayer.

1107
00:27:54,308 --> 00:27:56,997
(laughter)

1108
00:27:56,997 --> 00:27:57,924
- We have a secret story about that.

1109
00:27:57,924 --> 00:27:59,742
- [Liz] All my friends are
gonna be laughing at that.

1110
00:27:59,742 --> 00:28:00,929
- John's the best.

1111
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,102
I don't know if you know this.

1112
00:28:02,102 --> 00:28:03,587
Danielle, would you grab
crushing it, please?

1113
00:28:03,587 --> 00:28:05,157
- [Danielle] Yes, I would love to.

1114
00:28:05,157 --> 00:28:06,545
- And can you go to the back.

1115
00:28:06,545 --> 00:28:08,971
And can you read what
John Mayer said about--

1116
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:09,804
- John Mayer.

1117
00:28:09,804 --> 00:28:10,637
Quote.

1118
00:28:10,637 --> 00:28:12,197
"Gary is helping to calibrate the desires

1119
00:28:12,197 --> 00:28:13,782
"And expectations of a new generation

1120
00:28:13,782 --> 00:28:15,640
"Searching for a way
break through the noise.

1121
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,941
"He's loud, he's high energy,

1122
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:18,774
"And he's exactly right".

1123
00:28:18,774 --> 00:28:19,607
- Right.

1124
00:28:20,462 --> 00:28:21,378
- [Liz] How many times have you read that?

1125
00:28:21,378 --> 00:28:22,294
- [Danielle] Anything else?

1126
00:28:22,294 --> 00:28:24,372
- [Jerry] You can plan
that whole exchange out.

1127
00:28:24,372 --> 00:28:25,388
- [Gary] You know, actually,
you did that so well.

1128
00:28:25,388 --> 00:28:26,638
And I always like your voice.

1129
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,854
- [Danielle] Should I do the rock?

1130
00:28:27,854 --> 00:28:29,177
- You should do whatever
which one you think is cool.

1131
00:28:29,177 --> 00:28:31,135
- I hope you're listening, the Rock.

1132
00:28:31,135 --> 00:28:32,734
- [Gary] Do you like the Rock?

1133
00:28:32,734 --> 00:28:33,567
- Now I do.

1134
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:35,559
- [Jerry] You say it like
the Rock would say it.

1135
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,392
No don't do that, I was kidding.

1136
00:28:36,392 --> 00:28:37,225
- [Gary] Can you?

1137
00:28:37,225 --> 00:28:38,058
- Maybe, wait.
Hang on.

1138
00:28:38,058 --> 00:28:38,891
I'm passing it off to Jerry.

1139
00:28:38,891 --> 00:28:39,724
- No, no.

1140
00:28:40,777 --> 00:28:41,743
I don't have a Rock impersonation.

1141
00:28:41,743 --> 00:28:42,576
- Let's see.

1142
00:28:42,576 --> 00:28:43,409
- [Gary] Alright; enough of Crushing It.

1143
00:28:43,409 --> 00:28:44,474
The best book ever written.

1144
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:45,924
Let's move on.

1145
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:46,757
- Dani.

1146
00:28:46,757 --> 00:28:49,641
What was your Super Bowl experience?

1147
00:28:49,641 --> 00:28:51,155
- So, I watched the Super Bowl.

1148
00:28:51,155 --> 00:28:52,755
I changed my parents flight.

1149
00:28:52,755 --> 00:28:54,384
I don't know.

1150
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:56,638
There's a lot of things about
me that a lot of people know

1151
00:28:56,638 --> 00:28:57,604
'cause I'm an open book.

1152
00:28:57,604 --> 00:28:58,437
I'm Jewish.

1153
00:28:58,437 --> 00:28:59,502
The thing that everybody knows

1154
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:00,335
is that I'm obsessed with my family

1155
00:29:00,335 --> 00:29:01,402
and I would do anything for them.

1156
00:29:01,402 --> 00:29:03,477
I need them near me all the time.

1157
00:29:03,477 --> 00:29:05,418
- [Gary] That's right

1158
00:29:05,418 --> 00:29:06,856
So my parents were here

1159
00:29:06,856 --> 00:29:08,080
and they were meant to fly over here

1160
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,938
for niece's third birthday.

1161
00:29:08,938 --> 00:29:10,096
They were meant to fly home

1162
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:12,263
during the Super Bowl to Jacksonville.

1163
00:29:12,263 --> 00:29:14,079
- [Gary] And you're like
Gary, what's your problem?

1164
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:15,366
- [Jondie] You'll piss the Jaguars.

1165
00:29:15,366 --> 00:29:18,224
- [Danielle] My Dad is so
really beat up about it.

1166
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:19,865
- [Gary] But you're bigger Gater fans.

1167
00:29:19,865 --> 00:29:21,591
- Bigger Jaguar fans.

1168
00:29:21,591 --> 00:29:22,424
- [Gary] Wow.

1169
00:29:22,424 --> 00:29:25,098
- I don't know if I've
ever met a Jaguar fan.

1170
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:27,629
- [Jodie] We've had season tickets.

1171
00:29:27,629 --> 00:29:28,462
- [Danielle] We're from Jacksonville.

1172
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:30,149
- You love David Garrard?

1173
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:31,929
- [Danielle] Jodie should really.

1174
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:33,487
I don't really give a shit
to be completely honest.

1175
00:29:33,487 --> 00:29:34,320
- Clearly.

1176
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,153
You don't know even to who.

1177
00:29:35,153 --> 00:29:37,749
Do you even know who
Maurice Jones-Drew is?

1178
00:29:37,749 --> 00:29:39,547
- Yeah, he's...

1179
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:41,096
- [Jerry] yeah.

1180
00:29:41,096 --> 00:29:42,389
- No, it's amazing.

1181
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:46,138
I used to like to say, Joel Shmangy!

1182
00:29:46,138 --> 00:29:46,971
- [Gary] You remember
that from some years ago.

1183
00:29:46,971 --> 00:29:47,804
- It was ten years ago.

1184
00:29:47,804 --> 00:29:48,637
- [Gary] Okay.

1185
00:29:48,637 --> 00:29:49,470
Go ahead.

1186
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,303
- [Danielle] Anyways.

1187
00:29:50,303 --> 00:29:51,136
- Dad's pissed; Gary's pissed.

1188
00:29:51,136 --> 00:29:51,969
- [Danielle] He's supposed
to get off his flight.

1189
00:29:51,969 --> 00:29:53,190
- This is actually why we became friends.

1190
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,206
We were a Pencil of Promise dinner.

1191
00:29:55,206 --> 00:29:57,423
Well, actually we met during the naming

1192
00:29:57,423 --> 00:29:58,256
at South by South West, yes.

1193
00:29:58,256 --> 00:29:59,089
- [Danielle] South by South West.

1194
00:29:59,089 --> 00:29:59,922
That weird blah, blah, blah.

1195
00:29:59,922 --> 00:30:01,546
But the dinner at Pencils
of Promise was really.

1196
00:30:01,546 --> 00:30:02,379
And what we realized.

1197
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:03,212
- [Danielle] Ah, we just.

1198
00:30:03,212 --> 00:30:04,045
The Gary thing was huge.

1199
00:30:04,045 --> 00:30:04,878
- [Danielle] Huge.

1200
00:30:04,878 --> 00:30:05,711
- There's like seven Gary's.

1201
00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:06,544
- [Danielle] We started
leaving voicemails.

1202
00:30:06,544 --> 00:30:07,377
- Do you know how many Gary's there are?

1203
00:30:07,377 --> 00:30:08,210
- [Jerry] There's a lot.

1204
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,043
- [Gary] There's none.

1205
00:30:09,043 --> 00:30:09,876
No, no.

1206
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:10,709
Jerry, there's none.

1207
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:11,542
Jerry, ready?

1208
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:12,600
Name Gary's that you know.

1209
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,433
- [Danielle] We play the name game.

1210
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:14,568
For real, go.

1211
00:30:14,568 --> 00:30:16,225
- [Gary] Not even know of.

1212
00:30:16,225 --> 00:30:17,058
You know.

1213
00:30:17,058 --> 00:30:17,891
- [Jerry] Personally.

1214
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:18,724
- [Danielle] Gary Vaynerchuck.

1215
00:30:18,724 --> 00:30:20,242
- Gary Owen, good comedian.

1216
00:30:20,242 --> 00:30:21,075
Buddy of mine.

1217
00:30:21,075 --> 00:30:22,298
- [Gary] Yup.

1218
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:24,632
- I've met Gary Shandling once.

1219
00:30:24,632 --> 00:30:25,465
- [Gary] Okay.

1220
00:30:25,465 --> 00:30:26,298
(laughter)

1221
00:30:26,298 --> 00:30:27,131
- He's not even a real person.

1222
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:27,964
- [Gary] He's real.

1223
00:30:27,964 --> 00:30:29,965
- Yeah, I know.

1224
00:30:29,965 --> 00:30:30,921
- I think you have a point.

1225
00:30:30,921 --> 00:30:32,250
- Gary Snyder and Gary Vaynerchuck.

1226
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,572
That's it.
- It's hard.

1227
00:30:34,572 --> 00:30:35,405
It's crazy hard, bro.

1228
00:30:35,405 --> 00:30:36,706
- [Danielle] We bonded over my Dad's name.

1229
00:30:36,706 --> 00:30:37,703
- I don't know if you know this.

1230
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:38,744
This was the best.

1231
00:30:38,744 --> 00:30:39,577
18 months ago,

1232
00:30:39,577 --> 00:30:41,543
there was an article
that came out that said

1233
00:30:41,543 --> 00:30:43,445
the name Gary is about to go extinct.

1234
00:30:43,445 --> 00:30:44,278
That's it.

1235
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:45,111
It's over.

1236
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:46,245
- [Jerry] People are stopping.

1237
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:47,078
- I knew that there was this.

1238
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:47,911
I'm being dead serious.

1239
00:30:47,911 --> 00:30:48,744
- [Danielle] I might name my son Gary.

1240
00:30:48,744 --> 00:30:49,577
- Well, I know that.

1241
00:30:49,577 --> 00:30:50,410
I'm single-handedly;

1242
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,642
I actually met somebody in Minnesota

1243
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:55,714
at an IHOP that almost
named their kid Vayner.

1244
00:30:55,714 --> 00:30:56,547
- No.

1245
00:30:56,547 --> 00:30:57,380
- [Gary] Yeah.

1246
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,213
- [Danielle] That's actually a dope name.

1247
00:30:58,213 --> 00:30:59,957
- [Gary] And the wife was
holding the little guy.

1248
00:30:59,957 --> 00:31:00,790
And was like;

1249
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,141
honestly, our third one;

1250
00:31:02,141 --> 00:31:02,974
locked in.

1251
00:31:02,974 --> 00:31:03,807
(laughter)

1252
00:31:03,807 --> 00:31:04,640
- [Gary] Anyway.

1253
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,881
Nonetheless.

1254
00:31:05,881 --> 00:31:07,436
Gary is about to become extinct.

1255
00:31:07,436 --> 00:31:08,354
- We can't let that happen.

1256
00:31:08,354 --> 00:31:09,885
- [Gary] I know that
there's a Facebook add

1257
00:31:09,885 --> 00:31:10,988
that you can run.

1258
00:31:10,988 --> 00:31:13,150
Excuse me, a Twitter add that you can run

1259
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,545
based on first names.

1260
00:31:14,545 --> 00:31:17,272
So I run adds on Twitter.

1261
00:31:17,272 --> 00:31:18,296
- Oh, targets to Gary.

1262
00:31:18,296 --> 00:31:19,629
To every Gary.

1263
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:20,629
And it's me.

1264
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:22,766
I'm like, hey Gary.

1265
00:31:22,766 --> 00:31:23,599
It's Gary.

1266
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:24,963
(laughter)

1267
00:31:24,963 --> 00:31:26,604
I'm sure you probably heard by now

1268
00:31:26,604 --> 00:31:27,462
we're finished.

1269
00:31:27,462 --> 00:31:30,170
- [Jerry] That is freaking unbelievable.

1270
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,407
- But I won't fucking stand for this.

1271
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:32,548
Let's rally.

1272
00:31:32,548 --> 00:31:33,848
And it was great.

1273
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:34,681
All these Gary's.

1274
00:31:34,681 --> 00:31:35,793
- [Danielle] Can we pull that up.

1275
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:36,892
- We could probably find.

1276
00:31:36,892 --> 00:31:37,725
I don't know if it was a dark add.

1277
00:31:37,725 --> 00:31:38,558
- [Jerry] You should
there's supposed to be

1278
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:39,391
a Gary convention.

1279
00:31:39,391 --> 00:31:40,224
- See if you can find it.

1280
00:31:40,224 --> 00:31:41,057
It's like a Gary virtual convention.

1281
00:31:41,057 --> 00:31:41,890
- [Gary] So anyway, that's it.

1282
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,940
Literally, you named one dead Gary

1283
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,139
and one living Gary besides me.

1284
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:47,289
That's it.

1285
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:48,130
So you're dad, Gary.

1286
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:48,963
- [Danielle] So basically,

1287
00:31:48,963 --> 00:31:50,271
I changed my Mom and Dad's flight.

1288
00:31:50,271 --> 00:31:51,279
- [Gary] Yes.

1289
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,594
- They stayed, so they had
to leave the next morning

1290
00:31:53,594 --> 00:31:54,635
and their flight was at 8:00AM.

1291
00:31:54,635 --> 00:31:56,251
My Dad wanted to wake up at 3:45.

1292
00:31:56,251 --> 00:31:57,451
- [Liz] Make sure he got there.

1293
00:31:57,451 --> 00:31:58,809
- Everything was packed.

1294
00:31:58,809 --> 00:31:59,642
Whatever.

1295
00:31:59,642 --> 00:32:00,942
We got a huge fight about it.

1296
00:32:00,942 --> 00:32:01,987
I said this is ridiculous.

1297
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:03,021
He says I'm anxious.

1298
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,019
What do you want from me.

1299
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:05,018
I stayed here for the Super Bowl.

1300
00:32:05,018 --> 00:32:05,856
I'm like, Dad.

1301
00:32:05,856 --> 00:32:07,247
- [Gary] You're dad is
stupid handsome, by the way.

1302
00:32:07,247 --> 00:32:08,257
- [Danielle] He's a adorable.

1303
00:32:08,257 --> 00:32:09,290
- [Gary] How old is he?

1304
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,416
- 72, 73?

1305
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:11,640
- [Gary] He looks 70.

1306
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,883
- He says what do you want from me?

1307
00:32:12,883 --> 00:32:13,716
He says.

1308
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:14,549
I said, Dad.

1309
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:15,390
(laughter)

1310
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,336
I said, first of all,

1311
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:18,194
staying with your entire
family for the Super Bowl

1312
00:32:18,194 --> 00:32:19,861
is not a punishment.

1313
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:22,550
- [Gary] Who watched the game?

1314
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,833
- My dad, Greg, Jodi, me,

1315
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,808
my mom, Margot and baby Lee.

1316
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:27,792
- [Gary] So no random invite?

1317
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:29,191
This is a very tight-knit community.

1318
00:32:29,191 --> 00:32:30,358
- Favorite term ever.

1319
00:32:30,358 --> 00:32:31,549
What do you want from me?

1320
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,140
That's when you know
someone's exasperated.

1321
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,973
What do you want from me?

1322
00:32:33,973 --> 00:32:34,806
- He's the man.

1323
00:32:34,806 --> 00:32:37,194
By the way, watch my insta
story on Danielle Snyder.

1324
00:32:37,194 --> 00:32:38,435
- [Gary] Who were you rooting for?

1325
00:32:38,435 --> 00:32:39,268
- I was rooting for the Eagles.

1326
00:32:39,268 --> 00:32:40,101
I'm so sick of the Patriots.

1327
00:32:40,101 --> 00:32:41,275
- [Liz] Yeah, agreed.

1328
00:32:41,275 --> 00:32:42,108
I caught the fourth quarter.

1329
00:32:42,108 --> 00:32:43,266
- [Danielle] For someone who's
not a big football whatever.

1330
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:44,099
- [Gary] Yeah, fuck them.

1331
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:44,932
- Eagles.

1332
00:32:44,932 --> 00:32:46,049
- [Gary] Is Tom Brady good looking?

1333
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:47,857
Yeah, but I'm sick of looking at him.

1334
00:32:47,857 --> 00:32:48,690
- I agree.

1335
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:51,173
- [Danielle] I like a
little bit of character.

1336
00:32:51,173 --> 00:32:52,264
He looks like an android.

1337
00:32:52,264 --> 00:32:53,097
He's good looking.

1338
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:54,930
- [Danielle] Giselle is lovely by the way.

1339
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,346
- [Gary] You think he's good looking, Liz?

1340
00:32:56,346 --> 00:32:58,216
- I mean, I just don't
even like him, whatever.

1341
00:32:58,216 --> 00:32:59,049
- [Danielle] I just
like a little more rough

1342
00:32:59,049 --> 00:32:59,882
around the edges.

1343
00:32:59,882 --> 00:33:01,598
- But, did you see his
outfit walking into the game?

1344
00:33:01,598 --> 00:33:02,904
- [Gary] No, I don't look at anything.

1345
00:33:02,904 --> 00:33:03,943
- [Jerry] Would you feel
differently about it

1346
00:33:03,943 --> 00:33:04,776
if you were Gary Brady?

1347
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:05,609
- You know what's crazy, actually,

1348
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:06,442
you know what?

1349
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,122
The single reason I
love you is that scene.

1350
00:33:08,122 --> 00:33:09,116
The single reason.

1351
00:33:09,116 --> 00:33:10,424
- Oh, the To Brady sucks balls scene.

1352
00:33:10,424 --> 00:33:12,484
- [Gary] Except when you switch.

1353
00:33:12,484 --> 00:33:14,106
And that kind of made me scared.

1354
00:33:14,106 --> 00:33:15,305
And I was fuck.

1355
00:33:15,305 --> 00:33:16,928
One day, he's gonna retire.

1356
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,185
I'm gonna rule the world,

1357
00:33:18,185 --> 00:33:19,689
which means I'm gonna
have to stumble on him

1358
00:33:19,689 --> 00:33:20,910
somewhere in my 50's.

1359
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,413
And then he's gonna be this great.

1360
00:33:22,413 --> 00:33:23,246
See, Jordan's easy.

1361
00:33:23,246 --> 00:33:24,527
I hate Jordan, and it's easy.

1362
00:33:24,527 --> 00:33:25,360
- [Jerry] He's very easy.

1363
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,769
He's a bad fucking dude.

1364
00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:27,602
- [Gary] He is.

1365
00:33:27,602 --> 00:33:28,435
Just so everybody knows.

1366
00:33:28,435 --> 00:33:30,073
Listen, you can be mad at me.

1367
00:33:30,073 --> 00:33:31,231
He's not the best guy on earth.

1368
00:33:31,231 --> 00:33:32,064
(laughter)

1369
00:33:32,064 --> 00:33:33,633
Brady, on the other hand.

1370
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:35,441
seems like he might be.

1371
00:33:35,441 --> 00:33:37,463
- [Danielle] Did you watch
that Facebook live thing.

1372
00:33:37,463 --> 00:33:38,296
- [Gary] No, no.

1373
00:33:38,296 --> 00:33:39,321
Fuck that.

1374
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:40,521
I've gone way further than that, Dani.

1375
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:42,447
You don't understand who I am.

1376
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:45,371
I've paid people to find shit.

1377
00:33:45,371 --> 00:33:46,462
- [Danielle] What you find on me?

1378
00:33:46,462 --> 00:33:47,295
- Not you.

1379
00:33:47,295 --> 00:33:48,128
I give a fuck.

1380
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:48,961
I mean Brady

1381
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:50,210
who I need to tear down.

1382
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,043
- [Danielle] You don't
think I'm important enough?

1383
00:33:51,043 --> 00:33:51,876
No, you're very important.

1384
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:52,874
I just blindly believe in you.

1385
00:33:52,874 --> 00:33:54,090
- [Danielle] I know, I know.

1386
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:57,105
- You're the coolest person I know.

1387
00:33:57,105 --> 00:33:57,938
By the way,

1388
00:33:57,938 --> 00:34:01,605
if you're Instagram
doesn't have that quote.

1389
00:34:02,965 --> 00:34:03,914
- [Danielle] It's gonna be.

1390
00:34:03,914 --> 00:34:04,747
- And make your URL link to me.

1391
00:34:04,747 --> 00:34:06,605
- [Danielle] I'm running ads
for Danielle people on Twitter.

1392
00:34:06,605 --> 00:34:08,053
- [Gary] It's fans of Gary.

1393
00:34:08,053 --> 00:34:09,737
It works every time.

1394
00:34:09,737 --> 00:34:10,570
- [Gary] That scene.

1395
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:11,545
That was like the best

1396
00:34:11,545 --> 00:34:12,703
but then you broke my heart at the end

1397
00:34:12,703 --> 00:34:14,594
when you switched over and said fuck,

1398
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,427
he's a good dude.

1399
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,802
- Do you want a two minute
story about that scene?

1400
00:34:16,802 --> 00:34:17,717
- [Gary] Unbelievable.

1401
00:34:17,717 --> 00:34:18,988
- And listen, I...

1402
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:21,971
Not that Tom Brady needs to
get put up on any further

1403
00:34:21,971 --> 00:34:22,804
more of a pedestal.

1404
00:34:22,804 --> 00:34:23,637
- [Gary] I know.

1405
00:34:23,637 --> 00:34:24,469
But that was along time ago.

1406
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:25,302
- That initially.

1407
00:34:25,303 --> 00:34:27,734
So, the context is in the show,

1408
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:29,536
there's a charity gold tournament

1409
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:31,205
and we get paired up.

1410
00:34:31,205 --> 00:34:32,623
And the Vince character
and the Johnny character

1411
00:34:32,623 --> 00:34:34,170
get paired up with Tom Brady.

1412
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,844
And he's the nicest guy in the world.

1413
00:34:35,844 --> 00:34:36,746
I hate him

1414
00:34:36,746 --> 00:34:38,069
'cause I'm a Giants fan.

1415
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:38,902
And he wins me over in the end.

1416
00:34:38,902 --> 00:34:39,735
- [Gary] And just for everybody

1417
00:34:39,735 --> 00:34:40,568
who doesn't know thing about sports.

1418
00:34:40,569 --> 00:34:42,045
- And I get a man crush on Brady

1419
00:34:42,045 --> 00:34:43,077
in the end of the episode.

1420
00:34:43,077 --> 00:34:46,244
But, that was initially supposed to be

1421
00:34:47,235 --> 00:34:49,109
the Vince and Johnny character

1422
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:50,891
versus the Manning brothers.

1423
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:54,023
And about a week and a half
before something happened.

1424
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:55,150
They pulled out of the episode.

1425
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,087
The whole episode was written for them.

1426
00:34:57,087 --> 00:34:59,114
And, we still had to shoot the episode

1427
00:34:59,114 --> 00:35:00,769
so I think it was Wahlberg

1428
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:03,396
who suggested, listen.

1429
00:35:03,396 --> 00:35:05,968
And this is off the Brady
knee surgery season.

1430
00:35:05,968 --> 00:35:07,292
So he was just ready to come back.

1431
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:08,971
I think I can get Brady to do it.

1432
00:35:08,971 --> 00:35:10,533
It'll be me and Brady in the episode

1433
00:35:10,533 --> 00:35:12,016
replacing the Manning brothers.

1434
00:35:12,016 --> 00:35:14,766
So he steps in, fills those shoes

1435
00:35:15,621 --> 00:35:16,454
and kills us.

1436
00:35:16,454 --> 00:35:18,044
Now we're re-writing the episode,

1437
00:35:18,044 --> 00:35:19,601
and Doug Ellen, the show creator

1438
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:21,576
is like, what would your character

1439
00:35:21,576 --> 00:35:22,586
say to Brady.

1440
00:35:22,586 --> 00:35:24,156
Like, a Giant fan who hates Brady.

1441
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:26,911
I said let's really get
the heart of New York.

1442
00:35:26,911 --> 00:35:28,419
I called my buddy Paul I grew up with.

1443
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:30,136
Brooklyn as it gets.

1444
00:35:30,136 --> 00:35:30,969
I'm, hey Paul.

1445
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:32,693
He's on speaker.

1446
00:35:32,693 --> 00:35:35,297
If you saw Tom Brady in the street

1447
00:35:35,297 --> 00:35:36,443
a week before the Super Bowl

1448
00:35:36,443 --> 00:35:37,276
what would you say to him?

1449
00:35:37,276 --> 00:35:38,109
He's like:

1450
00:35:38,109 --> 00:35:39,592
"I'd fucking say Tom Brady

1451
00:35:39,592 --> 00:35:40,975
"Fucking sucks fucking balls".

1452
00:35:40,975 --> 00:35:41,808
(laughter)

1453
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:42,641
Doug went,

1454
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:43,628
done, thank you.

1455
00:35:43,628 --> 00:35:44,735
Hung up the phone.

1456
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:46,726
Went right into the episode.

1457
00:35:46,726 --> 00:35:47,559
You want to talk about things

1458
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:48,840
that get quoted to me.

1459
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,109
That is one of the quotes

1460
00:35:50,109 --> 00:35:52,494
that gets hit on me all the time.

1461
00:35:52,494 --> 00:35:53,867
- But you love him

1462
00:35:53,867 --> 00:35:55,194
is what you were gonna say.

1463
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,918
- Listen, he bailed us out of a jam.

1464
00:35:56,918 --> 00:35:57,751
- Yeah.

1465
00:35:57,751 --> 00:35:58,773
- For sure.

1466
00:35:58,773 --> 00:36:01,974
'Cause we would've had a serious problem.

1467
00:36:01,974 --> 00:36:05,766
- I like Hitler more than Tom Brady.

1468
00:36:05,766 --> 00:36:07,590
Yeah, that's where I went.

1469
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,673
I just want everybody to understand.

1470
00:36:08,673 --> 00:36:09,582
That's my truth.

1471
00:36:09,582 --> 00:36:12,381
- [Gary] I hate Tom Brady.

1472
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:14,714
I, Gary Vaynerchuck, hate...

1473
00:36:15,797 --> 00:36:17,065
You have to understand.

1474
00:36:17,065 --> 00:36:19,548
There's real life, and
then there's the Jets.

1475
00:36:19,548 --> 00:36:20,516
- [Jerry] I knew that was gonna come.

1476
00:36:20,516 --> 00:36:22,224
To me, it's very simple.

1477
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:24,224
Everything in real life,

1478
00:36:25,098 --> 00:36:26,464
99% of my life,

1479
00:36:26,464 --> 00:36:27,355
is very good.

1480
00:36:27,355 --> 00:36:28,188
I'm a good guy,

1481
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:29,021
I do the right thing.

1482
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:30,805
I don't say ludicrous
things like I just said.

1483
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:31,979
I'm a good guy.

1484
00:36:31,979 --> 00:36:33,487
In Jets life,

1485
00:36:33,487 --> 00:36:35,087
let me give you a good one.

1486
00:36:35,087 --> 00:36:36,002
In Jets life.

1487
00:36:36,002 --> 00:36:37,252
'Cause you have the letter D.

1488
00:36:37,252 --> 00:36:38,561
- [Danielle] This is great.

1489
00:36:38,561 --> 00:36:40,010
In Jets life,

1490
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,193
let me give you a great story.

1491
00:36:41,193 --> 00:36:42,026
I don't know.

1492
00:36:42,026 --> 00:36:43,249
Seven years ago at the Meadowlands,

1493
00:36:43,249 --> 00:36:44,082
just walking,

1494
00:36:44,082 --> 00:36:44,915
11-year old boy,

1495
00:36:44,915 --> 00:36:45,839
maybe nine,

1496
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,262
walking by with a Brady jersey;

1497
00:36:47,262 --> 00:36:48,598
I checked him.

1498
00:36:48,598 --> 00:36:49,823
(laughter)

1499
00:36:49,823 --> 00:36:51,386
And I just want everybody to know.

1500
00:36:51,386 --> 00:36:52,948
This is literally child abuse.

1501
00:36:52,948 --> 00:36:54,605
I check a kid.

1502
00:36:54,605 --> 00:36:55,440
I check him.

1503
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,507
I bump into him.

1504
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:58,424
He goes into the fence.

1505
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:01,357
His dad looks at me,

1506
00:37:01,357 --> 00:37:02,382
ready.

1507
00:37:02,382 --> 00:37:04,931
I go, what the fuck are
you gonna do about it?

1508
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,306
Guys, you don't understand.

1509
00:37:06,306 --> 00:37:07,947
- [Jerry] I get it.

1510
00:37:07,947 --> 00:37:10,855
- [Gary] Jake, were you there
when I punched the Dolphins.

1511
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:13,718
- [Tyler] Yeah, the game in Pittsburgh.

1512
00:37:13,718 --> 00:37:14,726
Oh, ready?

1513
00:37:14,726 --> 00:37:15,559
Pittsburgh game.

1514
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:18,361
Jets were playing Pittsburgh.

1515
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,475
The Jets miraculously in this season

1516
00:37:20,475 --> 00:37:21,660
win four or five games.

1517
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,363
Miraculously beat a very
good Pittsburgh team at home.

1518
00:37:24,363 --> 00:37:26,313
So Pittsburgh, for
anybody who knows the NFL,

1519
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:27,146
they travel.

1520
00:37:27,146 --> 00:37:28,587
Half the stadium is Steelers fans.

1521
00:37:28,587 --> 00:37:30,795
I don't like when people come to my house

1522
00:37:30,795 --> 00:37:32,407
and disrespect me.

1523
00:37:32,407 --> 00:37:34,042
This 87-year old man

1524
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:35,531
is walking up the stairs.

1525
00:37:35,531 --> 00:37:36,364
- No.

1526
00:37:36,364 --> 00:37:38,993
- [Gary] Stick with me.

1527
00:37:38,993 --> 00:37:40,201
He's 87.

1528
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:41,118
Tyler is...

1529
00:37:43,408 --> 00:37:45,124
He's walking up the stairs

1530
00:37:45,124 --> 00:37:45,957
slowly.

1531
00:37:45,957 --> 00:37:47,058
Right?

1532
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:48,191
The Jets have clearly won.

1533
00:37:48,191 --> 00:37:49,116
It's late fourth quarter,

1534
00:37:49,116 --> 00:37:50,199
23-6.

1535
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,956
I stand up and I go.

1536
00:37:51,956 --> 00:37:53,492
Hey old man!

1537
00:37:53,492 --> 00:37:54,750
- [Liz] No.

1538
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,301
- You're finished!

1539
00:37:56,301 --> 00:37:57,299
Right?

1540
00:37:57,299 --> 00:37:58,415
Everybody hears me.

1541
00:37:58,415 --> 00:37:59,248
Hey old man!

1542
00:37:59,248 --> 00:38:00,407
You're fucking finished.

1543
00:38:00,407 --> 00:38:02,073
- [Jerry] Are you referring
to the Steelers or him?

1544
00:38:02,073 --> 00:38:02,906
And then I go.

1545
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,019
And I don't mean the game!

1546
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:05,344
(laughter)

1547
00:38:05,344 --> 00:38:06,610
That literally happened.

1548
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,443
So look--

1549
00:38:07,443 --> 00:38:09,052
- [Liz] So you're an abusive Jets fan.

1550
00:38:09,052 --> 00:38:10,851
I'm a very bad person.

1551
00:38:10,851 --> 00:38:12,065
- [Jodie] Do you want to own the Jets?

1552
00:38:12,065 --> 00:38:13,288
- I do want to own the Jets.

1553
00:38:13,288 --> 00:38:14,830
- Sorry I jet felt like I had to.

1554
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:15,663
- I do.

1555
00:38:15,663 --> 00:38:17,056
Let's move on before I lose all my fans.

1556
00:38:17,056 --> 00:38:19,255
(laughter)

1557
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,469
You're Super Bowl experience, Jer.

1558
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:23,318
- We hosted some friends.

1559
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:24,151
- [Gary] You and your wife .

1560
00:38:24,151 --> 00:38:24,984
- Me and my wife,

1561
00:38:24,984 --> 00:38:25,817
Hosting friends.

1562
00:38:25,817 --> 00:38:29,050
And I think I consumed
about 4,500 calories.

1563
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,517
- [Gary] Like what?

1564
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:32,838
- Oh, there was like a Chili situation

1565
00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:34,282
and a homemade guacamole,

1566
00:38:34,282 --> 00:38:35,550
and buffalo cauliflower.

1567
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,687
And then we got ice cream form this place

1568
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:38,926
and that's where it all
went terribly wrong.

1569
00:38:38,926 --> 00:38:40,322
- [Gary] What place?

1570
00:38:40,322 --> 00:38:41,155
Do you want to--

1571
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:42,455
- OddFellows in Williamsburg.

1572
00:38:42,455 --> 00:38:43,463
Great place.

1573
00:38:43,463 --> 00:38:44,296
- [Gary] You know of this?

1574
00:38:44,296 --> 00:38:45,417
Ample Hills is pretty good, too.

1575
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:47,514
- [Jerry] They got a flavor
called Santa's cookies.

1576
00:38:47,514 --> 00:38:48,530
Let me tell you.

1577
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,825
(laughter)

1578
00:38:50,825 --> 00:38:54,453
- I have an interesting
relationship with food.

1579
00:38:54,453 --> 00:38:56,871
- That's when we figured
out what he's obsessed with.

1580
00:38:56,871 --> 00:38:57,865
- And I made a promise to myself.

1581
00:38:57,865 --> 00:38:59,274
Okay, I'm gonna have all this.

1582
00:38:59,274 --> 00:39:01,030
And then, when everyone leaves,

1583
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,121
I even said to my wife,

1584
00:39:02,121 --> 00:39:03,638
we're throwing this
freaking ice cream away.

1585
00:39:03,638 --> 00:39:04,904
- [Liz] And it didn't get thrown out.

1586
00:39:04,904 --> 00:39:06,135
- And then when I was
getting ready to do it

1587
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,641
I'm like, we should give it one more day.

1588
00:39:08,641 --> 00:39:09,980
So, one more day.

1589
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,410
- [Gary] So yesterday you ate a ton.

1590
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,568
- Yesterday, bled into the Monday.

1591
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:14,751
- Why didn't you bring any?

1592
00:39:14,751 --> 00:39:15,668
- And it's still there

1593
00:39:15,668 --> 00:39:16,567
by the way guys.

1594
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:17,425
It's still.

1595
00:39:17,425 --> 00:39:18,792
- Should we go over after this?

1596
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:20,124
- And here's how sick I am.

1597
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:22,174
I walk around this day,

1598
00:39:22,174 --> 00:39:23,757
three times since I've
been to your offices

1599
00:39:23,757 --> 00:39:24,718
I've thought about,

1600
00:39:24,718 --> 00:39:26,009
Oh I got that fucking
ice cream when I go home.

1601
00:39:26,009 --> 00:39:26,842
(laughter)

1602
00:39:26,842 --> 00:39:27,675
- No.

1603
00:39:27,675 --> 00:39:28,717
- [Jerry] Three separate times

1604
00:39:28,717 --> 00:39:30,041
since I've been in your office

1605
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:31,649
I've thought about that ice cream.

1606
00:39:31,649 --> 00:39:33,289
- You're hired, your hired, your hired.

1607
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:35,131
- So, that's really what I made.

1608
00:39:35,131 --> 00:39:36,955
Being that I wasn't that
interested in the game

1609
00:39:36,955 --> 00:39:37,997
and I love football.

1610
00:39:37,997 --> 00:39:38,938
But the game didn't interest me.

1611
00:39:38,938 --> 00:39:40,075
I made it about the food.

1612
00:39:40,075 --> 00:39:41,466
- [Gary] D, what is your favorite

1613
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:44,099
current App on your phone?

1614
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:44,932
Like new.

1615
00:39:44,932 --> 00:39:46,033
New favorite app.

1616
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:46,866
Or do you not have one?

1617
00:39:46,866 --> 00:39:48,707
'Cause this is actually an
interesting debate for me.

1618
00:39:48,707 --> 00:39:50,140
And I'll let you guys use that.

1619
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,865
Because one of the things
that's interesting to me

1620
00:39:51,865 --> 00:39:53,356
is how difficult it is.

1621
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:54,686
Actually, how about this?

1622
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:56,301
When's the last time you downloaded

1623
00:39:56,301 --> 00:39:57,479
a new app for your phone?

1624
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:58,892
D?

1625
00:39:58,892 --> 00:40:01,154
- Probably something related to filter.

1626
00:40:01,154 --> 00:40:01,987
- [Gary] That's fine.

1627
00:40:01,987 --> 00:40:02,820
But when?

1628
00:40:04,207 --> 00:40:05,040
- Maybe a month ago.

1629
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,873
- [Gary] Okay.

1630
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:06,814
Liz?

1631
00:40:06,814 --> 00:40:08,955
- I downloaded the Sephora app yesterday.

1632
00:40:08,955 --> 00:40:11,049
- [Gary] Respect.

1633
00:40:11,049 --> 00:40:11,882
Jer?

1634
00:40:11,882 --> 00:40:13,405
- I don't want to say.

1635
00:40:13,405 --> 00:40:14,521
- [Gary] Please do.

1636
00:40:14,521 --> 00:40:15,578
This, I won't make fun of.

1637
00:40:15,578 --> 00:40:16,694
'Cause I don't think I've
downloaded an app in months.

1638
00:40:16,694 --> 00:40:18,628
- [Jerry] No, you can make fun of it

1639
00:40:18,628 --> 00:40:20,852
because I downloaded Venmo.

1640
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,702
Because I didn't really
understand how it works.

1641
00:40:22,702 --> 00:40:23,887
- [Gary] Let me tell you
something about Venmo.

1642
00:40:23,887 --> 00:40:26,845
I was one of the first three
investors in Venmo in 2009.

1643
00:40:26,845 --> 00:40:28,298
And it's the best investment I ever made.

1644
00:40:28,298 --> 00:40:29,131
- [Jodie] Really?

1645
00:40:29,131 --> 00:40:30,163
- Yeah, but guess what.

1646
00:40:30,163 --> 00:40:31,179
- You're so smart.

1647
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,012
- Yes, I am.

1648
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:32,845
(laughter)

1649
00:40:32,845 --> 00:40:33,678
But

1650
00:40:33,678 --> 00:40:35,469
- [Danielle] I love the--

1651
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:36,561
- It's the best investment I made,

1652
00:40:36,561 --> 00:40:37,986
and the worst.

1653
00:40:37,986 --> 00:40:39,011
It was the best

1654
00:40:39,011 --> 00:40:42,695
'cause there's not much
I've been more right about.

1655
00:40:42,695 --> 00:40:44,734
It was the worst because
they sold so early,

1656
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,399
the economics to being right

1657
00:40:46,399 --> 00:40:48,083
weren't even remotely close.

1658
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:51,013
I made way more money on being wrong

1659
00:40:51,013 --> 00:40:53,696
and that is probably one
of the most right things.

1660
00:40:53,696 --> 00:40:54,629
So, you're right though.

1661
00:40:54,629 --> 00:40:55,737
You just fucking downloaded Venmo.

1662
00:40:55,737 --> 00:40:57,003
- [Jerry] I know.

1663
00:40:57,003 --> 00:40:57,836
You want to know how it happened?

1664
00:40:57,836 --> 00:40:58,669
(laughter)

1665
00:40:58,669 --> 00:40:59,502
You want to know why it happened?

1666
00:40:59,502 --> 00:41:00,335
- [Gary] Yes.

1667
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:01,884
It's because I won my fantasy league,

1668
00:41:01,884 --> 00:41:03,317
and they're like, we gotta pay you.

1669
00:41:03,317 --> 00:41:04,480
And I'm like, cash?

1670
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,313
- [Gary] I love the humble brag

1671
00:41:05,313 --> 00:41:06,987
of the fantasy league.

1672
00:41:06,987 --> 00:41:07,820
Did you dominate?

1673
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,653
Who did you crush?

1674
00:41:08,653 --> 00:41:09,486
Name one of your buddies right now,

1675
00:41:09,486 --> 00:41:11,938
and be eat shit, Rick.

1676
00:41:11,938 --> 00:41:13,804
- Taylor is his name.

1677
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:14,901
I got you, sorry it happened.

1678
00:41:14,901 --> 00:41:17,235
And he had tall girl
who you put up 48 points

1679
00:41:17,235 --> 00:41:18,071
and I still managed to win.

1680
00:41:18,071 --> 00:41:19,476
- [Gary] Jake, last time
you downloaded an app.

1681
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:20,845
- [Jake] Last night.

1682
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:21,678
- Jesus Christ.

1683
00:41:21,678 --> 00:41:23,806
- [Danielle] What'd you download?

1684
00:41:23,806 --> 00:41:25,049
- Last time?

1685
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,074
- It was probably six months ago.

1686
00:41:26,074 --> 00:41:27,007
- Tyler?

1687
00:41:27,007 --> 00:41:28,241
- [Tyler] Three weeks ago.

1688
00:41:28,241 --> 00:41:29,261
- Three weeks ago. What was it?

1689
00:41:29,261 --> 00:41:30,484
- [Tyler] Water Minder.

1690
00:41:30,484 --> 00:41:31,317
- Water Minder?

1691
00:41:31,317 --> 00:41:33,241
- [Tyler] It sends me
notifications to drink more water.

1692
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,249
- Interesting.

1693
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:35,082
- [Danielle] I need to do that.

1694
00:41:35,082 --> 00:41:35,915
- Has it been working?

1695
00:41:35,915 --> 00:41:36,748
No.

1696
00:41:36,748 --> 00:41:37,581
- [Tyler] Yeah.

1697
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:38,414
- Okay, respect.

1698
00:41:38,414 --> 00:41:39,247
- [Jerry] You need an app for that?

1699
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,080
- [Danielle] Tyler can you text me that

1700
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,913
- A month?

1701
00:41:40,913 --> 00:41:41,746
What was it?

1702
00:41:41,746 --> 00:41:43,046
Biscoot.

1703
00:41:43,046 --> 00:41:44,698
- Probably about a month.

1704
00:41:44,698 --> 00:41:46,503
- What do you think it was?

1705
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:48,426
- The seconds app for stair master.

1706
00:41:48,426 --> 00:41:49,259
- Okay.

1707
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:50,092
- D Rock?

1708
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:51,659
- [D Rock] Map my run.

1709
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:52,558
- What's that?

1710
00:41:52,558 --> 00:41:53,554
- [D Rock] Map my run.

1711
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:54,387
- Map my run.

1712
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:55,220
- [D Rock] For running.

1713
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,053
- Yeah.

1714
00:41:56,053 --> 00:41:56,886
I've heard of it.

1715
00:41:56,886 --> 00:41:57,719
- [Danielle] You want to know why

1716
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:59,193
I don't download more apps.

1717
00:41:59,193 --> 00:42:00,026
Two reasons.

1718
00:42:00,026 --> 00:42:01,723
In case you were wondering.

1719
00:42:01,723 --> 00:42:04,954
One: I'm at capacity on my iPhone.

1720
00:42:04,954 --> 00:42:06,342
- [Gary] What iPhone do you have?

1721
00:42:06,342 --> 00:42:07,175
- [Danielle] Jay, what am I?

1722
00:42:07,175 --> 00:42:08,290
Eight?

1723
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:09,198
- [Jodie] Yeah.

1724
00:42:09,198 --> 00:42:10,031
- It's good.

1725
00:42:10,031 --> 00:42:11,748
I take better photos
than all my ten friends.

1726
00:42:11,748 --> 00:42:13,939
But, the problem is,

1727
00:42:13,939 --> 00:42:16,304
in addition to being at capacity,

1728
00:42:16,304 --> 00:42:18,330
it slows your thing down,

1729
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:19,718
it so overwhelming to have another thing

1730
00:42:19,718 --> 00:42:21,551
to look at in the day.

1731
00:42:22,477 --> 00:42:24,393
- [Gary] Your only seven of'em.

1732
00:42:24,393 --> 00:42:25,226
- Exactly.

1733
00:42:25,226 --> 00:42:26,059
I should wipe out the whole phone.

1734
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:26,892
- You know?

1735
00:42:26,892 --> 00:42:27,725
Alright.

1736
00:42:27,725 --> 00:42:29,008
What do you want to yap about, Liz?

1737
00:42:29,008 --> 00:42:30,058
Open forum.

1738
00:42:30,058 --> 00:42:31,324
What's interesting?

1739
00:42:31,324 --> 00:42:32,432
- You're putting me on the spot now.

1740
00:42:32,432 --> 00:42:33,265
- [Gary] I am.

1741
00:42:33,265 --> 00:42:34,524
You could also talk to the community

1742
00:42:34,524 --> 00:42:35,789
and maybe ask them a question.

1743
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:39,734
You could ask us a question if you want.

1744
00:42:39,734 --> 00:42:40,942
You can take this anywhere.

1745
00:42:40,942 --> 00:42:41,775
Open forum.

1746
00:42:41,775 --> 00:42:43,058
As if we were not even in the room.

1747
00:42:43,058 --> 00:42:44,341
- Can Dani go first?

1748
00:42:44,341 --> 00:42:45,366
- Nope.

1749
00:42:45,366 --> 00:42:47,449
She sure can't.

1750
00:42:47,449 --> 00:42:48,678
- [Gary] Jerry can, but he's not going to.

1751
00:42:48,678 --> 00:42:50,065
- [Jerry] I'm not gonna let you off.

1752
00:42:50,065 --> 00:42:51,807
- So we're all gonna look
at you awkwardly, Liz.

1753
00:42:51,807 --> 00:42:52,848
- [Liz] Okay.

1754
00:42:52,848 --> 00:42:53,681
Cool.

1755
00:42:53,681 --> 00:42:55,199
I don't know.

1756
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:56,482
I think it's just the evolution

1757
00:42:56,482 --> 00:42:58,398
of ourselves and

1758
00:42:58,398 --> 00:43:00,222
how we portray ourselves digitally.

1759
00:43:00,222 --> 00:43:01,097
- [Gary] Okay.

1760
00:43:01,097 --> 00:43:03,591
- So, what are you
thinking is next for you?

1761
00:43:03,591 --> 00:43:04,583
What are you thinking is next for you?

1762
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:05,985
- And do you mean from the perspective

1763
00:43:05,985 --> 00:43:08,806
of what frontiers do you want to attack?

1764
00:43:08,806 --> 00:43:10,232
Or are you talking about,

1765
00:43:10,232 --> 00:43:13,523
are we living PR'd versions
of ourselves online.

1766
00:43:13,523 --> 00:43:14,573
- [Liz] Yeah.

1767
00:43:14,573 --> 00:43:18,089
- Like, one of the reasons
I think Dani is so cool

1768
00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:19,564
is if you see her Instagram, she's cool.

1769
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:20,978
- [Liz] Okay, you've
said this five times now.

1770
00:43:20,978 --> 00:43:21,920
- I'm trying to gas her up.

1771
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,778
- Thank you.

1772
00:43:22,778 --> 00:43:23,611
I love you, Gary.

1773
00:43:23,611 --> 00:43:24,444
- Do you feel like you're living

1774
00:43:24,444 --> 00:43:25,594
a totally different life online,

1775
00:43:25,594 --> 00:43:27,669
or do you think that's your life?

1776
00:43:27,669 --> 00:43:28,502
- I think two things.

1777
00:43:28,502 --> 00:43:29,335
- [Gary] Please.

1778
00:43:29,335 --> 00:43:31,424
- I think we're living in an age

1779
00:43:31,424 --> 00:43:34,066
where we have to be two versions.

1780
00:43:34,066 --> 00:43:35,709
The real version and the digital version.

1781
00:43:35,709 --> 00:43:37,330
- Can I ask you a question?

1782
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,317
And all of you.

1783
00:43:38,317 --> 00:43:39,689
'Cause I think this is
far more interesting

1784
00:43:39,689 --> 00:43:40,522
than this conversation

1785
00:43:40,522 --> 00:43:42,742
'cause I think we all know
this is in the zeitgeist.

1786
00:43:42,742 --> 00:43:45,178
I just think that's just
what always happened.

1787
00:43:45,178 --> 00:43:47,719
I think we always lived a life outside.

1788
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:48,552
- [Jerry] Public and private.

1789
00:43:48,552 --> 00:43:49,385
- That's right.

1790
00:43:49,385 --> 00:43:50,218
And for a lot of us,

1791
00:43:50,218 --> 00:43:52,592
you come from a family,

1792
00:43:52,592 --> 00:43:54,531
especially my immigrant family,

1793
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:56,649
nothing left the house.

1794
00:43:56,649 --> 00:43:57,696
Everything that happened

1795
00:43:57,696 --> 00:43:58,529
in those four walls.

1796
00:43:58,529 --> 00:43:59,362
Nothing.

1797
00:43:59,362 --> 00:44:00,454
We would fucking be

1798
00:44:00,454 --> 00:44:01,287
no teeth.

1799
00:44:01,287 --> 00:44:02,899
And everybody would walk out and be ding

1800
00:44:02,899 --> 00:44:03,732
- [Jerry] We're fine.

1801
00:44:03,732 --> 00:44:07,089
- [Gary] No dirty
laundry ever, ever, ever.

1802
00:44:07,089 --> 00:44:10,709
And so, using the 40-year old moms.

1803
00:44:10,709 --> 00:44:11,542
Cool.

1804
00:44:11,542 --> 00:44:13,120
So now you're doing at an Instagram,

1805
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,880
but that used to be meeting up for tea

1806
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,897
and never talking about the real shit.

1807
00:44:16,897 --> 00:44:18,480
So I think that

1808
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,313
everybody wants to fear monger technology.

1809
00:44:19,313 --> 00:44:20,146
- [Danielle] Totally.

1810
00:44:20,146 --> 00:44:20,979
- Oh.

1811
00:44:20,979 --> 00:44:22,931
Social media made us do this.

1812
00:44:22,931 --> 00:44:23,764
No.

1813
00:44:23,764 --> 00:44:25,772
This just scales what we've always done.

1814
00:44:25,772 --> 00:44:27,604
- We were talking about
it outside, weren't we?

1815
00:44:27,604 --> 00:44:28,437
About other people.

1816
00:44:28,437 --> 00:44:29,530
- [Gary] On your other podcast.

1817
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:30,363
- Right, yeah.

1818
00:44:30,363 --> 00:44:31,879
- That comes out at 6:00PM, right?

1819
00:44:31,879 --> 00:44:32,712
6:00PM

1820
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:34,905
- [Danielle] Push it out.

1821
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:35,738
No, we were.

1822
00:44:35,738 --> 00:44:36,988
I think it's...

1823
00:44:38,523 --> 00:44:40,463
I think what you're
saying is 100% accurate.

1824
00:44:40,463 --> 00:44:42,974
I think we're just more aware of it

1825
00:44:42,974 --> 00:44:44,074
because we can physically see it.

1826
00:44:44,074 --> 00:44:45,098
- [Gary] It's at scale.

1827
00:44:45,098 --> 00:44:46,206
- Yeah, but what about Gen Z.

1828
00:44:46,206 --> 00:44:47,714
I don't think they realize it.

1829
00:44:47,714 --> 00:44:50,300
I think they are living their true life,

1830
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,391
digitally.

1831
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:54,365
- Because their less
worried about circumstances.

1832
00:44:54,365 --> 00:44:55,198
In classic teenage form.

1833
00:44:55,198 --> 00:44:56,031
- [Liz] Because I think their less

1834
00:44:56,031 --> 00:44:57,773
aware of all of this.

1835
00:44:57,773 --> 00:44:58,606
- [Gary] Or,

1836
00:44:58,606 --> 00:44:59,889
they're smarter and realize
none of it actually matters.

1837
00:44:59,889 --> 00:45:00,722
- Maybe.

1838
00:45:00,722 --> 00:45:01,688
- [Gary] Because I remember

1839
00:45:01,688 --> 00:45:02,796
being in early social
media and I was like,

1840
00:45:02,796 --> 00:45:05,128
kids, don't put up your beer pong pictures

1841
00:45:05,128 --> 00:45:06,954
'cause college won't let you in.

1842
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,092
Like USC didn't fucking know.

1843
00:45:09,092 --> 00:45:10,858
- [Danielle] Yeah.

1844
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:11,691
- Jer.

1845
00:45:13,608 --> 00:45:14,900
- You got me hooked on,

1846
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,683
so we're talking about your family.

1847
00:45:16,683 --> 00:45:18,320
I think you can go one of two ways.

1848
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,811
You obviously embraced it,

1849
00:45:19,811 --> 00:45:21,185
but also on a business perspective,

1850
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:24,077
but also seeing the way
the world was going.

1851
00:45:24,077 --> 00:45:25,427
At what point did you make that choice.

1852
00:45:25,427 --> 00:45:26,410
'Cause you were raised

1853
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:28,126
to not let the private out

1854
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:29,995
and you've matured and grown.

1855
00:45:29,995 --> 00:45:31,329
- [Gary] I've lost
everything you just said

1856
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:33,003
'cause something weird just happened.

1857
00:45:33,003 --> 00:45:34,745
Please for the love of God

1858
00:45:34,745 --> 00:45:36,974
tell me your socks are not Lakers socks

1859
00:45:36,974 --> 00:45:37,815
when your a Knicks fan.

1860
00:45:37,815 --> 00:45:38,648
- No, no.

1861
00:45:38,648 --> 00:45:39,481
Come on.

1862
00:45:39,481 --> 00:45:40,448
Pistol Pete Maravich ladies and gentlemen.

1863
00:45:40,448 --> 00:45:41,556
- [Gary] Okay, at least
that's a little bit better.

1864
00:45:41,556 --> 00:45:42,389
- A little bit?

1865
00:45:42,389 --> 00:45:43,222
Oh, come on.

1866
00:45:43,222 --> 00:45:44,055
You don't have love for Pistol Pete?

1867
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:45,429
- [Gary] I love Pistol Pete.

1868
00:45:45,429 --> 00:45:46,846
But I don't like wearing any other team

1869
00:45:46,846 --> 00:45:47,696
but my team shit.

1870
00:45:47,696 --> 00:45:49,647
- [Jerry] I won't wear anything that's

1871
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:50,588
of my generation, you know?

1872
00:45:50,588 --> 00:45:51,421
- Even when your socks are dirty.

1873
00:45:51,421 --> 00:45:52,254
- [Gary] Yeah, okay.

1874
00:45:52,254 --> 00:45:53,087
- If it's pre-my generation.

1875
00:45:53,087 --> 00:45:53,920
- [Gary] I literally, you were talking

1876
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,753
and I loved where you were going.

1877
00:45:54,753 --> 00:45:55,586
Literally,

1878
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,089
it was like the best thing
you said this whole podcast.

1879
00:45:57,089 --> 00:45:57,931
Then I looked out.

1880
00:45:57,931 --> 00:45:59,621
And I'm like, if he's wearing Kobe socks,

1881
00:45:59,621 --> 00:46:01,010
who by the way I love in a lot of ways.

1882
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:02,780
- [Jerry] But I wouldn't wear Kobe socks.

1883
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:03,772
I love Kobe, but yes.

1884
00:46:03,772 --> 00:46:05,378
Let the record show, I
would not wear Kobe socks.

1885
00:46:05,378 --> 00:46:06,810
- [Gary] Are you and Kobe best friends?

1886
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:07,643
- No.

1887
00:46:07,643 --> 00:46:08,476
- [Gary] Have you me Kobe?

1888
00:46:08,476 --> 00:46:09,309
- I've met him, yes.

1889
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:10,142
But no, we're not best friends.

1890
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,431
- Who's your best sports friend?

1891
00:46:12,431 --> 00:46:13,705
- [Jerry] Oh, man.

1892
00:46:13,705 --> 00:46:14,538
- This is a fun game.

1893
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:15,546
- [Liz] Yeah.

1894
00:46:15,546 --> 00:46:16,379
- I love this game.

1895
00:46:16,379 --> 00:46:17,212
- [Gary] You have an answer?

1896
00:46:17,212 --> 00:46:18,045
- Yeah.

1897
00:46:18,045 --> 00:46:20,842
- [Gary] I can't wait to hear that.

1898
00:46:20,842 --> 00:46:22,133
- Describe best friend.

1899
00:46:22,133 --> 00:46:24,439
- Who, who's a professional athlete

1900
00:46:24,439 --> 00:46:27,255
which you deem you have
the best relationship with.

1901
00:46:27,255 --> 00:46:28,113
(laughter)

1902
00:46:28,113 --> 00:46:30,204
- If you texted them
right now, they reply.

1903
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,613
If you were like, hey
come over for dinner,

1904
00:46:31,613 --> 00:46:32,894
they'd be cool.

1905
00:46:32,894 --> 00:46:34,576
- Oh, I have an answer.

1906
00:46:34,576 --> 00:46:35,409
- [Gary] Who,

1907
00:46:35,409 --> 00:46:36,628
that is a professional athlete,

1908
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:37,819
tell the truth.

1909
00:46:37,819 --> 00:46:39,478
- Can I look through my phone?

1910
00:46:39,478 --> 00:46:41,094
- [Gary] You can while Dani goes.

1911
00:46:41,094 --> 00:46:42,440
Yeah, that's fine, go ahead.

1912
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,342
Mr. I've got so many sports friends.

1913
00:46:44,342 --> 00:46:45,324
- [Danielle] By the way,
I didn't say so many.

1914
00:46:45,324 --> 00:46:46,157
I was just more secure
with Jerry what gonna say.

1915
00:46:46,157 --> 00:46:46,990
- [Gary] No, no.

1916
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:47,823
Not you.

1917
00:46:47,823 --> 00:46:49,102
I was talking about Jerry.

1918
00:46:49,102 --> 00:46:52,134
He makes sense that he has a lot.

1919
00:46:52,134 --> 00:46:53,384
- [Danielle] Misty Copeland, for sure.

1920
00:46:53,384 --> 00:46:54,325
But that's a,

1921
00:46:54,325 --> 00:46:55,158
she's a ballerina.

1922
00:46:55,158 --> 00:46:56,225
It's a little different.

1923
00:46:56,225 --> 00:46:57,824
I'm not gonna be, bring over all of the--

1924
00:46:57,824 --> 00:46:59,299
- [Gary] Actually, and I'm not joking.

1925
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:01,397
This is not like a I'm
gonna get razzed on.

1926
00:47:01,397 --> 00:47:05,063
I think a lot of things
sports that people don't.

1927
00:47:05,063 --> 00:47:06,150
I'm asking you.

1928
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:07,299
Do ballerinas consider

1929
00:47:07,299 --> 00:47:08,966
being a ballerina a sport?

1930
00:47:08,966 --> 00:47:09,799
- 100%

1931
00:47:09,799 --> 00:47:10,632
- [Gary] Cool.

1932
00:47:10,632 --> 00:47:11,465
I believe that.

1933
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:12,710
- [Danielle] Should we
call Misty right now?

1934
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:13,568
- No.

1935
00:47:13,568 --> 00:47:14,486
I fully believe that.

1936
00:47:14,486 --> 00:47:16,018
That wasn't a leading question in any way.

1937
00:47:16,018 --> 00:47:17,345
I actually didn't know

1938
00:47:17,345 --> 00:47:18,178
how it was positioned.

1939
00:47:18,178 --> 00:47:20,541
And Andy Roddick is dope.

1940
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:21,516
I like Andy.

1941
00:47:21,516 --> 00:47:23,300
- Andy is your second
closest sports friend.

1942
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,623
- [Danielle] But, okay.

1943
00:47:24,623 --> 00:47:25,456
Close is not.

1944
00:47:25,456 --> 00:47:26,289
- [Gary] Right.

1945
00:47:26,289 --> 00:47:27,686
- Brooklyn is a really
good friend of mine.

1946
00:47:27,686 --> 00:47:28,862
- [Gary] She's crushing
on that show, right?

1947
00:47:28,862 --> 00:47:30,384
- She's amazing.

1948
00:47:30,384 --> 00:47:32,437
Andy is a stand up guy.

1949
00:47:32,437 --> 00:47:33,270
I really like Andy.

1950
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:34,103
- [Gary] Respect.

1951
00:47:34,103 --> 00:47:34,936
Liz?

1952
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:35,904
- I think you know him.

1953
00:47:35,904 --> 00:47:37,245
Mr. Nigel Sylvester.

1954
00:47:37,245 --> 00:47:38,078
- [Gary] Yes.

1955
00:47:38,078 --> 00:47:38,959
He's fucking awesome.

1956
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:39,792
- [Liz] He is amazing.

1957
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:40,912
- He just hit me up, am I seeing him?

1958
00:47:40,912 --> 00:47:41,745
Did you talk to him?

1959
00:47:41,745 --> 00:47:43,785
- [Danielle] Gary, what about you?

1960
00:47:43,785 --> 00:47:44,776
- That's a good fucking question.

1961
00:47:44,776 --> 00:47:45,609
Top ten, baby.

1962
00:47:45,609 --> 00:47:46,942
- [Jerry] Right?

1963
00:47:48,641 --> 00:47:49,923
- No, what I mean is,

1964
00:47:49,923 --> 00:47:50,756
I don't want to be like

1965
00:47:50,756 --> 00:47:52,126
yeah me and this person are friends

1966
00:47:52,126 --> 00:47:52,976
and they hear this podcast
and they're like, oh.

1967
00:47:52,976 --> 00:47:54,934
- By the way, I disclaimer.

1968
00:47:54,934 --> 00:47:56,601
Jerry, I disclaimer.

1969
00:47:57,509 --> 00:47:59,700
I'm a friend with the wife.

1970
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,358
- Instagram has changed my whole world.

1971
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:02,946
Because, every time an athlete.

1972
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:05,101
- [Danielle] I want to hear all of them.

1973
00:48:05,101 --> 00:48:06,829
I'm a hardcore fan of baseball players,

1974
00:48:06,829 --> 00:48:08,394
so I'm in love with Devon Travis.

1975
00:48:08,394 --> 00:48:09,698
He's been hurt his two years

1976
00:48:09,698 --> 00:48:11,228
at the Blue Jays.

1977
00:48:11,228 --> 00:48:12,129
But when he followed me, I'm like

1978
00:48:12,129 --> 00:48:13,960
fucking yes.

1979
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,028
And nobody outside of a Blue
Jays fan should be pumped

1980
00:48:16,028 --> 00:48:17,619
- That's who you were
the most excited about?

1981
00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:18,452
- No.

1982
00:48:18,452 --> 00:48:19,285
Probably the most excited.

1983
00:48:19,285 --> 00:48:20,226
- [Danielle] How about the Rock.

1984
00:48:20,226 --> 00:48:21,542
The Rock we lost our shit.

1985
00:48:21,542 --> 00:48:23,399
When the Rock followed me on Instagram.

1986
00:48:23,399 --> 00:48:24,232
'Cause he doesn't follow anybody.

1987
00:48:24,232 --> 00:48:25,065
- [Danielle] Did you ask him to follow me?

1988
00:48:25,065 --> 00:48:26,973
- We all shut down and were like,

1989
00:48:26,973 --> 00:48:27,806
alright, what does this mean?

1990
00:48:27,806 --> 00:48:28,639
(laughter)

1991
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:29,472
The craziest part about that.

1992
00:48:29,472 --> 00:48:30,305
- [Jerry] How will we do?

1993
00:48:30,305 --> 00:48:31,872
- That happened in a three week period

1994
00:48:31,872 --> 00:48:34,527
where the Rock, Kevin
Hart and Metro Boomin

1995
00:48:34,527 --> 00:48:36,420
all followed me, and I was like,

1996
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,253
okay, something's happened.

1997
00:48:37,253 --> 00:48:38,086
- [Jerry] A billion people right there.

1998
00:48:38,086 --> 00:48:39,469
- [Danielle] What happened?

1999
00:48:39,469 --> 00:48:40,386
Explain it.

2000
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:43,030
- I was penetrating the attention graph.

2001
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,405
- [Danielle] How'd you penetrate?

2002
00:48:44,405 --> 00:48:46,554
- I penetrated by putting
out the best fucking content

2003
00:48:46,554 --> 00:48:48,012
contextual to Instagram.

2004
00:48:48,012 --> 00:48:50,737
- [Danielle] Should you
do a takeover for me?

2005
00:48:50,737 --> 00:48:51,570
- No.
(laughter)

2006
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:52,452
Jerry, what's your answer?

2007
00:48:52,452 --> 00:48:54,310
- Well, and the reason why I
said let me look at my phone

2008
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:56,018
is not 'cause oh there's so many.

2009
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:57,059
It's I don't want to say,

2010
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,358
oh me and this person are cool

2011
00:48:58,358 --> 00:48:59,386
and then they hear this podcast and like,

2012
00:48:59,386 --> 00:49:00,646
we're not that freaking cool.

2013
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,290
- [Gary] No, that's exactly right.

2014
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:03,123
- I don't want to be presumptuous.

2015
00:49:03,123 --> 00:49:03,956
- [Gary] And by the way, for me too.

2016
00:49:03,956 --> 00:49:04,789
Like Curtis Martin.

2017
00:49:04,789 --> 00:49:05,622
I'm thinking about the people like

2018
00:49:05,622 --> 00:49:06,455
Draymond Green.

2019
00:49:06,455 --> 00:49:07,529
These are people I have really
great relationships with.

2020
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:08,362
- [Jerry] Yeah.

2021
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,924
I don't think anybody of them

2022
00:49:09,924 --> 00:49:11,528
would consider me one of their
five or six best friends.

2023
00:49:11,528 --> 00:49:12,361
- [Danielle] Me neither.

2024
00:49:12,361 --> 00:49:13,887
- I haven't gotten to
that place with them.

2025
00:49:13,887 --> 00:49:14,973
I expect it to happen.

2026
00:49:14,973 --> 00:49:16,617
- [Danielle] But you're cool.

2027
00:49:16,617 --> 00:49:18,132
Brandon Marshall is probably closest.

2028
00:49:18,132 --> 00:49:19,463
- Me and Wes Matthews are pretty cool.

2029
00:49:19,463 --> 00:49:20,296
- [Gary] Who?

2030
00:49:20,296 --> 00:49:21,129
- Wes Matthews.

2031
00:49:21,129 --> 00:49:21,962
- [Gary] Yup.

2032
00:49:21,962 --> 00:49:23,611
I've met Frank Kaminsky.

2033
00:49:23,611 --> 00:49:24,793
A lot of NBA guys.

2034
00:49:24,793 --> 00:49:25,684
- [Gary] Yup.

2035
00:49:25,684 --> 00:49:30,139
'Cause they know how big
of a fan I am of the NBA.

2036
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:32,014
He's not an athlete, but he's a coach.

2037
00:49:32,014 --> 00:49:32,847
- Should I call Tom Brady.

2038
00:49:32,847 --> 00:49:33,680
- This guy I could maybe get.

2039
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,537
- [Gary] Shhh.

2040
00:49:35,537 --> 00:49:37,310
- I might be able to get
him to show up for me

2041
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:38,327
if I ever need

2042
00:49:38,327 --> 00:49:39,377
Coach Calipari.

2043
00:49:39,377 --> 00:49:40,210
- [Gary] Really?

2044
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,246
- He coached me at a
fantasy camp one time.

2045
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:43,720
He was my coach of my team.

2046
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,605
- [Gary] And you guys really went crazy.

2047
00:49:44,605 --> 00:49:45,541
- And we, let me tell you.

2048
00:49:45,541 --> 00:49:46,691
- Did you guys make out?

2049
00:49:46,691 --> 00:49:47,649
- No, no.

2050
00:49:47,649 --> 00:49:48,482
- [Gary] But close.

2051
00:49:48,482 --> 00:49:49,315
- But how I like to describe him

2052
00:49:49,315 --> 00:49:50,631
is almost like if Frank
Sinatra was a coach.

2053
00:49:50,631 --> 00:49:51,565
That's how cool he is.

2054
00:49:51,565 --> 00:49:52,647
- [Danielle] That's pretty cool.

2055
00:49:52,647 --> 00:49:53,588
- It just makes you feel,

2056
00:49:53,588 --> 00:49:56,104
he really does make you feel special.

2057
00:49:56,104 --> 00:49:57,788
And that dude is unbelievable.

2058
00:49:57,788 --> 00:49:58,754
Coach Cal.

2059
00:49:58,754 --> 00:49:59,587
- I was just saying if you wanted.

2060
00:49:59,587 --> 00:50:01,436
- [Gary] Open forum, go D.

2061
00:50:01,436 --> 00:50:03,446
- I just think we're living
in a really interesting time.

2062
00:50:03,446 --> 00:50:06,876
And I personally coming from
the vantage point of fashion,

2063
00:50:06,876 --> 00:50:09,300
and being our tenth year anniversary,

2064
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,524
I'm having a hard time grappling with

2065
00:50:11,524 --> 00:50:12,906
the way that the world is moving.

2066
00:50:12,906 --> 00:50:14,847
Especially now that I have a niece

2067
00:50:14,847 --> 00:50:16,322
and nephew in my life

2068
00:50:16,322 --> 00:50:18,155
and I'm watching the interactions,

2069
00:50:18,155 --> 00:50:20,171
and the way that digital
is affecting them.

2070
00:50:20,171 --> 00:50:21,004
- [Gary] I see.

2071
00:50:21,004 --> 00:50:21,837
- Mommy and Daddy, and Aunt.

2072
00:50:21,837 --> 00:50:22,670
- [Gary] You feel bad about that?

2073
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:23,503
- Everyone's on their phone.

2074
00:50:23,503 --> 00:50:24,336
I do.

2075
00:50:24,336 --> 00:50:25,169
- I think your niece and nephew

2076
00:50:25,169 --> 00:50:28,353
should spend more time
on technology, not less.

2077
00:50:28,353 --> 00:50:29,186
I really do.

2078
00:50:29,186 --> 00:50:30,019
I understand.

2079
00:50:30,019 --> 00:50:31,926
But, I'm saying things here today.

2080
00:50:31,926 --> 00:50:33,230
I mean, the Hitler thing
I'm gonna have to deal with.

2081
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,734
By the way, real quick.

2082
00:50:34,734 --> 00:50:36,251
I didn't mean it, everyone.

2083
00:50:36,251 --> 00:50:38,401
My great, great grandparents got killed.

2084
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:39,392
Buried themselves.

2085
00:50:39,392 --> 00:50:40,225
So, please.

2086
00:50:40,225 --> 00:50:41,275
Before I have to spend an hour and a half

2087
00:50:41,275 --> 00:50:42,658
on Twitter apologizing,

2088
00:50:42,658 --> 00:50:43,974
I hope I understood the
tongue and cheek of that.

2089
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:46,057
But I do hate Tom Brady at a level

2090
00:50:46,057 --> 00:50:47,005
that is ridiculously uncomfortable.

2091
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:48,435
- [Danielle] That's why I didn't tell you

2092
00:50:48,435 --> 00:50:49,528
he was my best friend of
all my sports friends.

2093
00:50:49,528 --> 00:50:51,105
- [Gary] The niece and nephew thing.

2094
00:50:51,105 --> 00:50:53,614
This is what parents
do of every generation.

2095
00:50:53,614 --> 00:50:57,539
Your parents' parents' made
them not want to watch Elvis.

2096
00:50:57,539 --> 00:50:58,372
Right?

2097
00:50:58,372 --> 00:51:01,196
Madonna was scary for kids of my age.

2098
00:51:01,196 --> 00:51:02,145
- [Danielle] He's right.

2099
00:51:02,145 --> 00:51:05,106
Miley Cyrus twerking a couple minutes ago.

2100
00:51:05,106 --> 00:51:08,793
Six years, seven years
ago is lame on Instagram.

2101
00:51:08,793 --> 00:51:10,440
What world do you think
your niece and nephew

2102
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,273
are gonna work and live in?

2103
00:51:11,273 --> 00:51:12,106
- [Danielle] Do you want me to explain?

2104
00:51:12,106 --> 00:51:12,939
- What world do you think
they're gonna live in?

2105
00:51:12,939 --> 00:51:13,772
- [Danielle] Do you want me to really

2106
00:51:13,772 --> 00:51:14,605
get to meat of the issue?

2107
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:15,438
Do you want me to really dig deep

2108
00:51:15,438 --> 00:51:16,371
and tell you what I'm
really trying to say?

2109
00:51:16,371 --> 00:51:17,396
- [Gary] Sure.

2110
00:51:17,396 --> 00:51:18,653
- It's not that I'm worried that

2111
00:51:18,653 --> 00:51:21,187
they're gonna be privy to whatever

2112
00:51:21,187 --> 00:51:22,020
on Instagram.

2113
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,067
It's not some sort of censorship.

2114
00:51:24,067 --> 00:51:28,734
What I'm worried about is the
way that social media has,

2115
00:51:30,871 --> 00:51:31,704
the psychology of it.

2116
00:51:31,704 --> 00:51:33,782
How it's affected human relationships.

2117
00:51:33,782 --> 00:51:35,234
- [Gary] Can I throw a curve ball at you?

2118
00:51:35,234 --> 00:51:36,067
- Sure.

2119
00:51:36,067 --> 00:51:37,081
What we owe each other as people.

2120
00:51:37,081 --> 00:51:37,937
And what friendship really means now.

2121
00:51:37,937 --> 00:51:40,071
- [Gary] Let's talk about it for a minute.

2122
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:41,036
A lot of people want to blame

2123
00:51:41,036 --> 00:51:43,669
a lot of kids troubles
on social media, right?

2124
00:51:43,669 --> 00:51:45,054
- [Danielle] Cyber-bullying.

2125
00:51:45,054 --> 00:51:47,053
I want to blame it on the fact

2126
00:51:47,053 --> 00:51:48,939
that parents are teaching
kids in their first 15 years

2127
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,096
that they won everything
and their the best

2128
00:51:51,096 --> 00:51:53,741
and teaching no reality of confrontation.

2129
00:51:53,741 --> 00:51:56,549
When you give eighth place
trophies to a seven-year old

2130
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:59,594
they hae no understanding
how to deal with anything.

2131
00:51:59,594 --> 00:52:01,892
So I think one of the
things we do all the time

2132
00:52:01,892 --> 00:52:04,338
is we blame other forces, not ourselves.

2133
00:52:04,338 --> 00:52:05,805
When you have a country that goes

2134
00:52:05,805 --> 00:52:09,167
through 70 years of
prosperity pretty consistently

2135
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,338
We get into third generation dynamics

2136
00:52:11,338 --> 00:52:14,126
where people worry what
milk is in their Starbucks

2137
00:52:14,126 --> 00:52:15,942
and they think that's a bad thing.

2138
00:52:15,942 --> 00:52:19,117
We just have no context of real life,

2139
00:52:19,117 --> 00:52:21,610
So, I think what we've done.

2140
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:22,748
Liz?

2141
00:52:22,748 --> 00:52:23,759
- I agree with you.

2142
00:52:23,759 --> 00:52:25,567
- [Gary] This is the world
you're interested in.

2143
00:52:25,567 --> 00:52:27,617
We want to blame things like that.

2144
00:52:27,617 --> 00:52:29,200
We all got bullied.

2145
00:52:30,043 --> 00:52:32,016
A lot of us who are over 35

2146
00:52:32,016 --> 00:52:33,407
lived in a world where,

2147
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,746
when you came in second place,

2148
00:52:34,746 --> 00:52:37,178
you cried because you lost.

2149
00:52:37,178 --> 00:52:40,319
I think we have to
really be very thoughtful

2150
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,994
about the way we're parenting.

2151
00:52:41,994 --> 00:52:44,284
Your sister, no matter what

2152
00:52:44,284 --> 00:52:46,301
is parenting in a
fundamentally different way

2153
00:52:46,301 --> 00:52:47,134
than your mother did,

2154
00:52:47,134 --> 00:52:48,973
and a fundamentally different
way that her mother did.

2155
00:52:48,973 --> 00:52:52,061
And like anything, you can over-correct

2156
00:52:52,061 --> 00:52:53,860
in one way or the other.

2157
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,317
The micro-analyzation.

2158
00:52:56,317 --> 00:52:57,150
My parents didn't know anything

2159
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:59,428
that was going on in my life.

2160
00:52:59,428 --> 00:53:01,253
And you take the generation above me,

2161
00:53:01,253 --> 00:53:02,627
they literally knew nothing.

2162
00:53:02,627 --> 00:53:04,610
'Cause they threw them
outside and they went.

2163
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,668
Here's where my point is.

2164
00:53:06,668 --> 00:53:10,767
Facebook didn't make
you vote for somebody.

2165
00:53:10,767 --> 00:53:11,983
- [Danielle] Russia maybe did.

2166
00:53:11,983 --> 00:53:13,250
You know what I mean?

2167
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:14,083
It sure didn't.

2168
00:53:14,083 --> 00:53:15,366
'Cause you clicked things

2169
00:53:15,366 --> 00:53:17,082
that made those ads
show up in front of you.

2170
00:53:17,082 --> 00:53:19,565
We have to take way more responsibility

2171
00:53:19,565 --> 00:53:23,156
before we blame social
media and technology.

2172
00:53:23,156 --> 00:53:25,115
And until we start taking accountability

2173
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:27,606
which we have fundamentally avoided

2174
00:53:27,606 --> 00:53:28,655
for the last 50 years,

2175
00:53:28,655 --> 00:53:32,080
we will lose a lot of these micro-battles.

2176
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,313
So, cool.

2177
00:53:33,313 --> 00:53:36,066
You want to blame technology
or something else,

2178
00:53:36,066 --> 00:53:37,521
but maybe if you taught your kid

2179
00:53:37,521 --> 00:53:39,337
how to take a fucking an L

2180
00:53:39,337 --> 00:53:40,804
in the first ten years of their life,

2181
00:53:40,804 --> 00:53:42,520
maybe they'd know how to take an L.

2182
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,361
- [Danielle] Right.

2183
00:53:43,361 --> 00:53:45,894
What are your thoughts of
parenting in New York City?

2184
00:53:45,894 --> 00:53:47,685
I think that there's a lot of insanity.

2185
00:53:47,685 --> 00:53:49,393
But I want to teach my
kids how to take an L.

2186
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:50,867
- [Danielle] But, besides that.

2187
00:53:50,867 --> 00:53:52,876
Do you think growing
up at a LA or New York.

2188
00:53:52,876 --> 00:53:53,709
We talked about this a little bit outside.

2189
00:53:53,709 --> 00:53:54,542
- [Gary] Of course.

2190
00:53:54,542 --> 00:53:55,489
You're a product of your environment

2191
00:53:55,489 --> 00:53:56,322
and of your parents, and of your DNA.

2192
00:53:56,322 --> 00:53:57,155
- I'm from Jacksonville, Florida.

2193
00:53:57,155 --> 00:53:58,556
You love me, I'm cool.

2194
00:53:58,556 --> 00:53:59,462
I think we should all
move to Jacksonville.

2195
00:53:59,462 --> 00:54:00,295
- [Gary] Oh, wait.

2196
00:54:00,295 --> 00:54:01,238
You're from Jacksonville?

2197
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,369
I take back everything I said.

2198
00:54:03,369 --> 00:54:04,804
- You know what I'm saying?

2199
00:54:04,804 --> 00:54:06,793
My dad's from Brooklyn and he's dope.

2200
00:54:06,793 --> 00:54:08,051
His name is Gary.

2201
00:54:08,051 --> 00:54:09,921
(laughter)

2202
00:54:09,921 --> 00:54:10,946
It was a different time.

2203
00:54:10,946 --> 00:54:12,229
- [Gary] I think parenting

2204
00:54:12,229 --> 00:54:15,371
is an unbelievably important job

2205
00:54:15,371 --> 00:54:18,288
and I think that the gravitas of it

2206
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,058
for this latest generation

2207
00:54:21,058 --> 00:54:22,935
made them over-correct

2208
00:54:22,935 --> 00:54:25,098
in a way that is creating vulnerability.

2209
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:26,496
I really believe that.

2210
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:28,045
- Yeah but I don't even think it's kids.

2211
00:54:28,045 --> 00:54:29,822
I think it's us, too.

2212
00:54:29,822 --> 00:54:31,489
We're insecure, too.

2213
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,456
- [Danielle] We're a bunch of big babies.

2214
00:54:33,456 --> 00:54:34,289
- Yeah.

2215
00:54:34,289 --> 00:54:35,382
- Meanwhile,

2216
00:54:35,382 --> 00:54:38,632
me and everybody I know that
had my circumstances or DNA

2217
00:54:38,632 --> 00:54:40,224
are cruising along

2218
00:54:40,224 --> 00:54:44,190
because we got shit on all
the time when we were kids.

2219
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:45,023
I'm being serious, D.

2220
00:54:45,023 --> 00:54:45,856
- [Danielle] That's
why I love you so much.

2221
00:54:45,856 --> 00:54:46,924
Yeah, getting D's and F's,

2222
00:54:46,924 --> 00:54:49,487
and not being the best at sports.

2223
00:54:49,487 --> 00:54:52,760
I learned how to love to lose early on.

2224
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,968
We do not teach that anymore.

2225
00:54:54,968 --> 00:54:57,575
There's this great fear.

2226
00:54:57,575 --> 00:54:59,942
Playing basketball with my little guy

2227
00:54:59,942 --> 00:55:01,433
and beating him and him crying.

2228
00:55:01,433 --> 00:55:02,893
Yeah motherfucker, grow.

2229
00:55:02,893 --> 00:55:04,067
- [Jerry] That's what I wanted to ask

2230
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,276
in the open forum.

2231
00:55:05,276 --> 00:55:07,300
I don't ever let my nephew win.

2232
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,807
- [Gary] 'Cause you're smart.

2233
00:55:08,807 --> 00:55:11,461
- But I actually thought of this recently.

2234
00:55:11,461 --> 00:55:14,226
We played a little pick
up hoops in his basement.

2235
00:55:14,226 --> 00:55:15,059
- [Gary] Dunk on his fucking face.

2236
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:18,584
- I let him score every now and then.

2237
00:55:18,584 --> 00:55:19,815
I even said to my wife,

2238
00:55:19,815 --> 00:55:20,863
I gotta let him win a little it, right?

2239
00:55:20,863 --> 00:55:21,998
- [Gary] My brother AJ out there.

2240
00:55:21,998 --> 00:55:23,697
- [Jerry] It's not in me to let him win.

2241
00:55:23,697 --> 00:55:24,838
- I gotta wrap up?

2242
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:26,613
He's giving the looks.

2243
00:55:26,613 --> 00:55:27,587
He's a killer

2244
00:55:27,587 --> 00:55:28,787
because

2245
00:55:28,787 --> 00:55:29,720
he didn't beat me in basketball

2246
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,620
until he was 17 years old.

2247
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,036
And when he did.

2248
00:55:33,036 --> 00:55:34,553
It fucking tasted amazing.

2249
00:55:34,553 --> 00:55:36,536
Because when you fucking let your kids win

2250
00:55:36,536 --> 00:55:37,708
on dumb shit.

2251
00:55:37,708 --> 00:55:39,478
They don't understand that gratitude

2252
00:55:39,478 --> 00:55:40,311
or the process.

2253
00:55:40,311 --> 00:55:42,672
And they definitely don't know
how to deal with adversity.

2254
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:46,865
And so when Sally pants 49
says you're ugly on Instagram

2255
00:55:46,865 --> 00:55:49,871
they fucking fold like
cheap fucking chair.

2256
00:55:49,871 --> 00:55:51,054
Motherfuckers.

2257
00:55:51,054 --> 00:55:52,053
That's the show.

2258
00:55:52,053 --> 00:55:52,886
See ya.

2259
00:55:54,362 --> 00:55:56,483
- [Danielle] Oh you guys.

2260
00:55:56,483 --> 00:00:00,000
(soft music)
