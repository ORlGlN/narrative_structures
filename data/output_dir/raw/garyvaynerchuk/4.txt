00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,460
The answer to every
question is more content.

7
00:00:11,243 --> 00:00:13,793

He's such a good dude.

29
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:09,173

31
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,453

- What you up to, what are you guys doing?

35
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,710
- I just came in, chopped
it up with some people,

36
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,950
bouncing now and go to San
Francisco in a couple hours.

37
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,010
- Oh dope, dope, dope.

38
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,730
What are you doing in San Fran?

39
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,880
- Starting to trying to
win a Super Bowl baby.

40
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,150
Buy the Jets, win a Super Bowl.

41
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,630
- Yeah I love it, I love it.

42
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,340
- You hit me any time
like I said, any time.

43
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,173
- Thank you brother.

44
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:29,006
- Anything.

45
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:29,839
'Cause it's crazy.

46
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,672
- I agree.

47
00:01:30,672 --> 00:01:31,651
- Because I think you
should be more activations

48
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:33,480
for the content capturing.

49
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:37,100
- I don't care about
what's happening in here.

50
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,070
- It's what people are
seeing about it digitally.

51
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,620
- Is there a new flavor here
for me to try at Kickstart?

52
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,790
- There's two flavors.

53
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,130
- Here we go.

54
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,370
As you guys know, the old wine world,

55
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,040
I know how to analyze beverages.

56
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,000
Very Mountain Dewy in its flavor.

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
This Kickstart Mountain Dew,

58
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,500
original Dew flavor so
the dewiness makes sense.

59
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,400
I can do some Dew.

60
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,460
Feel like I'm in a fuckin' commercial.

61
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,300
When you make it, pick the 39
that you're most excited about

62
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,350
and literally go like, you know set it up

63
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,510
for like a minute or
first 10 seconds of like

64
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,240
we fuckin' crushed it, it was amazing

65
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,570
and then one, two, three,
four, you know like

66
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,680
even as you're showing
them, number three like

67
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,050
so that they can really
understand like yet exactly.

68
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,600
Like I want them to
understand the level of assets

69
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,080
and then maybe even like a box of like

70
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,377
recommended segmentation.

71
00:02:30,377 --> 00:02:32,212
- Yeah exactly.

72
00:02:32,212 --> 00:02:33,795

You're dwelling not regretting.

179
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,030
It seizes your moment.

180
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,460
Johnny I did, the book's coming.

181
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,754
If you're the face of the
business, put out content.

182
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:25,900
I put out content,
VaynerMedia puts out content,

183
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,780
we both put out content.

184
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,240
Content, content, content, content.

185
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,380
The answer to every
question is more content.

186
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,160
More content.

187
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:36,320
There's too much bad content.

188
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,090
There's never too much good content.

189
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,920
Like content and you don't
know if you have good content

190
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,590
and you gotta let the market decide.

191
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,630
So the answer for right
while there's a land grab

192
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,180
is just more fuckin' content.

193
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,750
More content, more content because

194
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,380
99% of people are just not
putting out enough content.

195
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,550
So I'm not worried about the 1% that are.

196
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,267
So the answer is fuckin' more content.

197
00:06:57,267 --> 00:00:00,000
