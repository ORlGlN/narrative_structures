1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,427
- About to do this podcast,

2
00:00:02,427 --> 00:00:03,729
so what's the name of the podcast?

3
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:05,065
- Analyze Asia.

4
00:00:05,065 --> 00:00:06,010
- I'm ready.

5
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,510
(upbeat rock music)

6
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,057
I'm obsessed with the notion of all of us

7
00:00:12,057 --> 00:00:14,830
who are listening right now
want to achieve something,

8
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,861
whether we wanna sell something,

9
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:17,994
whether we wanna run for government,

10
00:00:17,994 --> 00:00:19,978
whether we want somebody to know about

11
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,920
our daughter's music skills.

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,104
And the way you do that is by
getting somebody's attention,

13
00:00:25,104 --> 00:00:26,642
and then telling them something.

14
00:00:26,642 --> 00:00:31,029
I am fascinated by
podcasts, by Facebook ads,

15
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:34,119
by KOLs, by all the different
things happening in the world

16
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:36,302
in all the regions, and
I think some things are

17
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,643
very overpriced, you know, direct mail,

18
00:00:38,643 --> 00:00:40,935
billboards, television commercials,

19
00:00:40,935 --> 00:00:43,675
and I think some things are under priced,

20
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:45,209
aforementioned KOLs.

21
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:48,490
So, that's what I do, and along the way

22
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,457
I've build my brand quite a bit.

23
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:52,273
I've written four New York
Times best selling books,

24
00:00:52,273 --> 00:00:54,077
and I give keynote
speeches all of the world,

25
00:00:54,077 --> 00:00:56,116
including one here today in Singapore.

26
00:00:56,116 --> 00:00:59,345
- I thought it was very
interesting that you mentioned KOL

27
00:00:59,345 --> 00:01:01,710
because key opinion leader,
that is a term that's used

28
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,113
in China, so you're understanding of China

29
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:04,777
is probably pretty interesting.

30
00:01:04,777 --> 00:01:07,552
- Yeah, I mean, look, I,
you know, as you know,

31
00:01:07,552 --> 00:01:08,568
and now to update all of you,

32
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,227
I've been very thoughtful
of entering the Asian market

33
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:13,584
mainly in China, we were talking earlier,

34
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:15,239
I, like many Americans, do think of it as

35
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:19,189
mainland China, then I put
Japan and Korea into a bucket,

36
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:20,616
and then I think about the rest,

37
00:01:20,616 --> 00:01:23,503
but I'm very aware of Singapore
and Malaysia, Jakarta,

38
00:01:23,503 --> 00:01:24,336
things like that.

39
00:01:24,336 --> 00:01:26,010
I think about it thoughtfully,

40
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,145
You know, I pride myself
in being open minded and

41
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:31,491
thoughtful. I think American
business men and women

42
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:34,304
tend to be closed minded;
we're very insular.

43
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:36,998
It's something people don't
understand about Americans.

44
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:38,836
So, I've been very thoughtful
over the last four or five

45
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:39,818
years, paying close attention.

46
00:01:39,818 --> 00:01:41,581
I was an angel investor in path,

47
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:44,400
so obviously I knew a lot
of what was going on here.

48
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,474
And, again, I think that there is

49
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,229
so much real, pure-bread
entrepreneurial spirit

50
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,887
in the overall Asian market

51
00:01:51,887 --> 00:01:53,205
that I've been watching from afar.

52
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:56,032
Early this year, I took my
first trip to Hong Kong.

53
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:59,027
Now, I'm here in Singapore.
VaynerMedia has real ambition

54
00:01:59,027 --> 00:02:00,438
to open an office here.

55
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:03,975
I have ambition to be in
mainland China twice next year.

56
00:02:03,975 --> 00:02:06,991
Japan, Korea, Malaysia.

57
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:09,463
So, yes, I do have an understanding.

58
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,600
And there's obviously many things

59
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,940
that the mainland China companies

60
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,243
are further ahead than the U.S. markets,

61
00:02:15,243 --> 00:02:19,076
and there's also uniqueness
in Southeast Asia,

62
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:22,642
platforms and execution that
I'm always paying attention to

63
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,076
because I try to figure out,

64
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:25,737
do they make sense in
an American environment?

65
00:02:25,737 --> 00:02:27,786
How are our citizens different?

66
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:30,259
What are the infrastructure differences?

67
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:31,889
But yeah, I really wanna win,

68
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:34,409
and I think you can't
win in the next 40 years,

69
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:36,922
without being thoughtful
in every part of the world,

70
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:38,838
including Africa and South America,

71
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:39,870
and things of that nature.

72
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,214
- I've enjoy your books because
you always talk about social

73
00:02:42,214 --> 00:02:44,586
media as a way to grab attention.

74
00:02:44,586 --> 00:02:45,419
- Yes.

75
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:47,094
- And the way you think
about how to get customers

76
00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:49,333
to come towards you, you're
very customer-centric.

77
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,166
- Yes.

78
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,463
- So, I only have two questions.

79
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,296
- Please.
- But I'm gonna move to that,

80
00:02:52,296 --> 00:02:53,931
to the rest of the more interesting stuff.

81
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:55,079
Can you share about how you think of

82
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,947
social media that has evolved
from the past to today

83
00:02:57,947 --> 00:03:00,775
and what are your favorite
social media tools?

84
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:04,141
- So, I think the only thing
that's evolved, and if you read

85
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:08,149
Crush It, which I wrote
in 2008, came out in 2009.

86
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:11,695
I'm as big of buyer on
this revolution as anybody,

87
00:03:11,695 --> 00:03:14,393
and I'm glad I put it on paper, right?

88
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:16,679
So, I think the only
that's really changed is

89
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:19,271
nobody doubts it anymore.

90
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:22,631
This is change in
governments, and society,

91
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:25,300
and propaganda in a way that now it's,

92
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,232
I laugh when people,

93
00:03:27,232 --> 00:03:30,467
I have business meetings where
people literally spend the

94
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:33,545
first 20 minutes talking
about Russia invading America

95
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:35,260
through it's Facebooks and this

96
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,074
da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da,

97
00:03:37,074 --> 00:03:38,556
and then all of a sudden,
we get to marketing

98
00:03:38,556 --> 00:03:40,316
and they tell me Facebook's not that big,

99
00:03:40,316 --> 00:03:41,392
they should still do television.

100
00:03:41,392 --> 00:03:42,749
I'm like, wait a minute, what
about the first 20 minutes

101
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:44,399
when you said our entire
government is being

102
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:46,292
overthrown by social media?

103
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,563
But now to sell your blouses or your soda,

104
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:50,235
it's not important?

105
00:03:50,235 --> 00:03:51,653
So, I think the only thing that's changed

106
00:03:51,653 --> 00:03:54,766
is people's acceptance
of it and its scale.

107
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:57,339
My favorite right now
is definitely Instagram

108
00:03:57,339 --> 00:04:00,103
because of its flexibility
and because of its

109
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:03,266
overwhelming attention and because

110
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:05,180
if you're trying to sell
something to somebody

111
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,195
20 to 45, it is the platform,
along with Facebook,

112
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:12,039
but a little bit more because under 27,

113
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:15,132
it's got so much more juice than Facebook.

114
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:17,539
And that is, you know,
obviously in all the markets

115
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:20,060
that Instagram is and some
of the people listening here,

116
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,487
it has not penetrated that
market, but that is my favorite

117
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:24,445
right now.

118
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:25,977
- I enjoy your books.

119
00:04:25,977 --> 00:04:28,772
One of the things is,
the way you think about

120
00:04:28,772 --> 00:04:30,611
business pragmatism, and of course,

121
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:32,333
the story of your family business,

122
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,424
so I wanted to talk about your two books,

123
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:36,996
Crush It and Ask Gary Vee,
and since you are here.

124
00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:41,131
So in Ask Gary Vee, I know in
the first chapter, you talk

125
00:04:41,131 --> 00:04:43,681
about the closet as a
metaphor, looking at high-level

126
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:46,551
principles, such as bring
value to the customer,

127
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:49,318
always play the long
game of lifetime value.

128
00:04:49,318 --> 00:04:51,534
Can you talk about how do they guide you,

129
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:53,468
in terms of how you
think and how you execute

130
00:04:53,468 --> 00:04:56,065
because you seem to be able to bridge it

131
00:04:56,065 --> 00:04:58,147
pretty quickly and you feel that execution

132
00:04:58,147 --> 00:05:00,248
is really the key to everything.

133
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:01,243
- So it's super interesting.

134
00:05:01,243 --> 00:05:05,195
This is such a great way to start my trip.

135
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:06,028
I just want everybody to know,

136
00:05:06,028 --> 00:05:08,285
I'm about to pay your host
here a huge compliment.

137
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:09,132
We don't know each other,

138
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:10,245
but I have a funny feeling we're gonna

139
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:12,062
know each other for a very long time.

140
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,277
I meet a lot of people.

141
00:05:14,277 --> 00:05:17,264
I have the film, so if any of you guys,

142
00:05:17,264 --> 00:05:18,814
maybe we'll send it to you,

143
00:05:18,814 --> 00:05:21,026
and we'll use it for another podcast.

144
00:05:21,026 --> 00:05:23,643
You said something now in your question,

145
00:05:23,643 --> 00:05:25,691
I'm listening to the way
you're asking questions

146
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:28,351
and then obviously you have
the benefit of the last hour

147
00:05:28,351 --> 00:05:32,026
and realizing how thoughtful you are,

148
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:35,110
something that I'm becoming
more in tune with is,

149
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,027
I'm the most consumer-centric thing

150
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:41,161
that I know of.

151
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:43,792
Other people, other businesses,

152
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:46,975
I'm watching how two of
my partners Acrim Ryson,

153
00:05:46,975 --> 00:05:49,079
David D. Rock, just reacted,

154
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:52,649
I'm unbelievably consumer centric.

155
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:56,128
So, clouds and dirt, my thesis is,

156
00:05:56,128 --> 00:05:58,353
if you care more about
the end consumer than

157
00:05:58,353 --> 00:06:01,936
you care about your
own self, you will win.

158
00:06:02,835 --> 00:06:04,799
So I talk a lot about 51-49,

159
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,309
for people that really follow my content.

160
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:08,864
I really live it, I
really genuinely live it.

161
00:06:08,864 --> 00:06:12,055
I never make short-term
financial decisions.

162
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:15,841
I'm always trying to bring
more value to the other party.

163
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:17,304
I do that for a couple reasons.

164
00:06:17,304 --> 00:06:20,050
Number one, I think I'm
talented enough to get

165
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,480
quite a bit in my 49.

166
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,222
I also think it's unbelievable leverage.

167
00:06:25,222 --> 00:06:26,982
I also think it's a nice legacy,

168
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:30,321
I think it's nice to do, I think
it's a nice legacy to have,

169
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:32,426
and I do that with my
interpersonal relationships,

170
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:33,996
and I definitely do
that with my businesses.

171
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:36,193
So, my principles guide everything.

172
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:38,116
You're right execution's
everything and I think what's

173
00:06:38,116 --> 00:06:40,289
interesting about the
clouds and dirt metaphor,

174
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:42,195
is it helps people paint a picture of

175
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:44,231
what I'm most worried
about; which is, I believe,

176
00:06:44,231 --> 00:06:47,136
99% of the people listening to
this podcast spend an ungodly

177
00:06:47,136 --> 00:06:50,136
amount of time in the middle.

178
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:51,641
I'll give you an example of something

179
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:53,861
in the middle, process.

180
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:57,634
Process is held on such a
pedestal in modern business

181
00:06:57,634 --> 00:07:00,725
society and I find that be in the middle.

182
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:04,014
I understand its value, but I
do feel that if you push hard

183
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:07,786
on the clouds, your religion
and you push hard in the dirt,

184
00:07:07,786 --> 00:07:11,806
the actual doing, that the
process gets commoditized

185
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,625
and you go faster.

186
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,022
And so yes I have principles
of bringing more value,

187
00:07:16,022 --> 00:07:19,780
the lifetime value, attention,
arbitrage, as I mentioned

188
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,887
earlier and then I'm
never too fancy to do.

189
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:25,344
I mean, I will be honest with you,

190
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:28,343
I think even this 30 minutes
is a good example of that.

191
00:07:28,343 --> 00:07:31,477
I didn't over ask Risa, I
have no clue how many people

192
00:07:31,477 --> 00:07:32,990
listen to your podcast.

193
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,065
I'm never in a place where I
think I'm too fancy to do the

194
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:40,297
work and I take a lot of
pride that I'm a practitioner.

195
00:07:40,297 --> 00:07:42,339
I understand Facebook and
Snapchat and Instagram,

196
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:44,987
these platforms better than
most because I use them

197
00:07:44,987 --> 00:07:48,323
multiple times every day 365 days a year.

198
00:07:48,323 --> 00:07:50,447
I think it's a huge competitive advantage,

199
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:53,847
and I think, obviously
you mentioned earlier,

200
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:56,680
HBS and Harvard, I think the thing

201
00:07:58,306 --> 00:07:59,170
that I've learned as

202
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,390
not a good student and as an executor,

203
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:05,157
now that I'm 41 on the verge
of being 42 years old is,

204
00:08:05,157 --> 00:08:09,171
man a lot of things breakdown
between theory and execution,

205
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:12,616
and I am absolutely
obsessed with execution

206
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:15,601
and I do think that theory
at a lot of times sits in the

207
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:18,856
middle, I think you have to
push yourself to the clouds.

208
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:21,726
To a bigger calling and I
think there's no better calling

209
00:08:21,726 --> 00:08:22,750
than the end consumer,

210
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,613
if you're building a consumer product.

211
00:08:24,613 --> 00:08:26,364
- There's a lot of startups
out there dreaming about

212
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:28,953
becoming unicorns and you have
been a investor of unicorns,

213
00:08:28,953 --> 00:08:31,204
but I also understand you have
a very different perspective

214
00:08:31,204 --> 00:08:33,530
to business, because I've
heard a couple of interviews

215
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,733
particularly the recent one on recoup.

216
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:37,895
So, can you share a little
bit about your philosophies

217
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:39,705
particularly in becoming sustainable,

218
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:44,110
focusing on top-line revenue
and optimizing for profit?

219
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,659
- Yeah I think it's a great
question and we got to speak

220
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,661
to it a little bit before as well.

221
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,673
I'm just trying make all of
you, who are listening jealous

222
00:08:50,673 --> 00:08:53,405
that you missed out on so much
good stuff before we started

223
00:08:53,405 --> 00:08:54,306
the podcast.

224
00:08:54,306 --> 00:08:55,371
So, I'll try to fill you in.

225
00:08:55,371 --> 00:08:58,097
Yeah I think again and I'm
gonna give you a compliment,

226
00:08:58,097 --> 00:09:00,561
the fact that you use
consumer-centric and you used

227
00:09:00,561 --> 00:09:04,011
practicality, I feel like a lot
of people are confused by me

228
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:07,025
I think I do a very good job
building a persona that makes

229
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:08,498
it a little bit of enigma.

230
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:11,659
The fact that you've been
able to synthesize me

231
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:15,132
makes me think you're
smart, which is interesting

232
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:17,170
and I guess this is what it comes down to.

233
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,513
My friends, we are living
through the greatest era of

234
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:21,909
financial arbitrage machines.

235
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:25,662
When I hear unicorn, yes
there's the companies that have

236
00:09:25,662 --> 00:09:28,437
been successful, but to me I'm
worried, because I think most

237
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:30,724
of the people that are deemed
unicorns today are just

238
00:09:30,724 --> 00:09:33,926
rhinoceroses wearing outfits
that look like a unicorn,

239
00:09:33,926 --> 00:09:37,803
because a lot of the current
unicorns are not sustainable

240
00:09:37,803 --> 00:09:40,295
with a macro economic slowdown.

241
00:09:40,295 --> 00:09:43,931
And so, you brought up a great point,

242
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:47,036
which is, it may not be the
way we manipulate economies.

243
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:50,063
It maybe something like a war
or something else that creates

244
00:09:50,063 --> 00:09:53,669
a need for liquid, that
will force a correction.

245
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:57,004
I think that's exactly astute
observation and to me the

246
00:09:57,004 --> 00:09:58,489
question is very simple.

247
00:09:58,489 --> 00:09:59,845
So for example, the business I run today,

248
00:09:59,845 --> 00:10:01,637
it's 150 million a year revenue business.

249
00:10:01,637 --> 00:10:03,503
It makes some level of profit.

250
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,685
This year the least that
it ever has, however;

251
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:09,901
if shit got difficult
next year, even during

252
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,946
The Great Depression,
brands advertised, right?

253
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,928
Not everybody goes out of business.

254
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:17,875
If shit hits the fan tomorrow
every brand in the world is

255
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,498
gonna start scrutinizing how it spends

256
00:10:19,498 --> 00:10:21,019
its marketing dollars.

257
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:24,346
I believe if every brand lost
half of its marketing budget

258
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:28,179
next year, everyone, that my
company would grow 10X because

259
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:30,647
they would have to scrutinize
where they spend their money

260
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:34,814
and spending it with us is far
better than spending it with

261
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:39,298
WPP agencies that want to sell
highly profitable television

262
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:40,471
and programmatic banners.

263
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:43,438
So for me, I'm thinking about that.

264
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:47,197
I think a lot of the unicorns
are not profitable and they

265
00:10:47,197 --> 00:10:51,367
need the next round of capital,
and if that goes away their

266
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:55,248
businesses break. And so I'm
yelling because it's too late

267
00:10:55,248 --> 00:10:59,162
for Spotify or Ubers or

268
00:10:59,162 --> 00:11:00,667
all these big companies.

269
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,109
They're on their way.

270
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:05,351
They're on their way but there's
a lot of young kids who are

271
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:08,464
in the middle, who are
raising their A or their B,

272
00:11:08,464 --> 00:11:10,631
who have no thought, none,

273
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:13,070
of actually building a business.

274
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,019
What their trying to do is
build a big enough valuation,

275
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,279
so that on their third fundraising round,

276
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,093
they can take money off the table.

277
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:24,380
The fact that their kids who
are able to get to a C&D round

278
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,706
and are able to take tens
and hundreds of millions of

279
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:29,508
dollars off the table, without
ever building a successful

280
00:11:29,508 --> 00:11:32,695
business is clearly attractive.

281
00:11:32,695 --> 00:11:35,965
That's fine for a founder or
two, but when the shit hits the

282
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:38,252
fan, that's not gonna be good
for the investors and more

283
00:11:38,252 --> 00:11:40,608
importantly, in my opinion, the employees

284
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:43,489
and I have a problem with that.

285
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:46,577
- Suppose today you can
tell your 20- year old self

286
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:49,498
something on business, what
would be the advice you give him

287
00:11:49,498 --> 00:11:51,149
that you should not do?
- That's a good question.

288
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,910
I would say that your intuition is right.

289
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,570
That as long as you don't
die, this is a marathon

290
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,250
and it's a hell of a lot
better to train for a marathon,

291
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,848
than a sprint and that's it.

292
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:06,681
I can't, I'm so grateful
for where I'm sitting today.

293
00:12:06,681 --> 00:12:09,717
Heading into the prime of my
business career with really

294
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:13,163
deep fundamental skill sets,
that will help me navigate

295
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:14,909
through no matter what
happens, going forward.

296
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:18,540
Both emotionally and in business and so,

297
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,119
I was a very unique kid.

298
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:22,158
I built a very build
big business in my 20s

299
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,469
and was still paying
myself $60,000 a year.

300
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:28,973
And didn't need stuff because
I wanted to be all-time great

301
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:31,719
and I kept reinvesting in
my businesses and instead of

302
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:34,927
buying watches and sneakers and cars,

303
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:37,767
and I wouldn't really want to
say too much because I would

304
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:40,870
be scared if I said something,
that kid would do something

305
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,703
differently than he did.

306
00:12:42,703 --> 00:12:45,087
- Since we are in Asia, that
most businesses are actually

307
00:12:45,087 --> 00:12:47,855
driven by family and one of the
things I actually identified

308
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:50,610
when I read Oscar reviews,
that you're also working in

309
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,073
family business too and I think
that's probably one of the

310
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:56,979
most interesting and very
under-talked in most of your

311
00:12:56,979 --> 00:12:58,665
interviews. So, I want to ask you,

312
00:12:58,665 --> 00:13:01,363
what is the experience like
and how do you navigate the

313
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,384
dynamics and working

314
00:13:02,384 --> 00:13:03,834
with family?
- That's good.

315
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:06,232
- So, I've been getting into
with this a little bit more

316
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:08,071
now that AJ has left VaynerMedia.

317
00:13:08,071 --> 00:13:09,991
This is probably the first time
I've really operated in some

318
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:12,761
pseudo-capacity of not
having family with me,

319
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:14,823
in my entire career.

320
00:13:14,823 --> 00:13:17,561
Even though AJ's still on the
cap table and things of that

321
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:20,027
nature and I still talk to him about it.

322
00:13:20,027 --> 00:13:24,194
Though to his credit, he never
asks and lets me do my thing.

323
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:27,835
It's probably the thing I'm most proud of.

324
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:29,503
I think when people look back at my career

325
00:13:29,503 --> 00:13:33,804
and dig under the hood,
which even me saying that

326
00:13:33,804 --> 00:13:36,524
speaks to the audacity that
I have and I want to be an

327
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,495
all-time entrepreneur.

328
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:39,473
I really do, but not because I say it,

329
00:13:39,473 --> 00:13:40,976
because I execute.

330
00:13:40,976 --> 00:13:44,806
I'm very proud that from 22 to
34, I built my dad's business

331
00:13:44,806 --> 00:13:45,639
for him.

332
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,454
To give you the answer for
everybody who's listening,

333
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:50,886
because it's very hard, the
reason I've been able to make

334
00:13:50,886 --> 00:13:53,125
family businesses work is
because I love my dad and brother

335
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,453
more than I like money.

336
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:57,218
It's just really not complicated.

337
00:13:57,218 --> 00:13:59,434
Family businesses are difficult
because you're choosing

338
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:00,966
between family and money.

339
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,425
Let's make it very binary.

340
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,810
You can pull over on the
side of the road right now.

341
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,353
You can turn off your treadmill.

342
00:14:06,353 --> 00:14:07,871
You can stop walking your dog.

343
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,302
I promise you that's all that's happening.

344
00:14:10,302 --> 00:14:14,469
It's the love of your family
member, versus the money

345
00:14:15,344 --> 00:14:19,511
and what's overlaid and
the hardest part is pride,

346
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:22,864
or the score, as I call it.

347
00:14:22,864 --> 00:14:25,043
My biggest problem hasn't been the money,

348
00:14:25,043 --> 00:14:28,824
it's been the competitive
nature of trying to figure out

349
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:31,634
who's better. Me and my
dad. Me and my brother.

350
00:14:31,634 --> 00:14:33,019
The thing that has the most difficult,

351
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:35,939
is the narrative on
who's driving the ship.

352
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:39,508
Who's the best player on the
team and getting the respect

353
00:14:39,508 --> 00:14:42,260
back and forth and I would
say, it was easier with my

354
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,808
brother than it was with my dad.

355
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:48,474
As that would make sense but,
I think the reason, I've been

356
00:14:48,474 --> 00:14:52,776
able to be successful is a
little bit of 51-49, as I talked

357
00:14:52,776 --> 00:14:56,389
about earlier, I do that
with my two family members.

358
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:58,857
But I would say this, it is
easily the most difficult thing

359
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:01,449
that I think most people have
to go through, because there's

360
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:04,173
first of all, it's hard
enough to build a business.

361
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:07,756
When you overlay the
emotional bag baggage of

362
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:10,256
family dynamics, insecurities,

363
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,083
fairness and I also

364
00:15:15,195 --> 00:15:16,176
only worked with my brother,

365
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:17,019
who's 11 years younger,

366
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:19,342
if my sister had joined the business,

367
00:15:19,342 --> 00:15:20,756
and she was 3 1/2 years younger than me.

368
00:15:20,756 --> 00:15:22,339
If she joined the wine
business that would've

369
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,607
been another dynamic.

370
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:27,665
It is very difficult and
I would tell everybody the

371
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:29,584
following line:

372
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:32,804
you've got to try your best
to take a step back and think

373
00:15:32,804 --> 00:15:36,870
about the funeral of
the other individuals,

374
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,251
and take that into account.

375
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:41,117
The thing that always
allowed me to navigate was,

376
00:15:41,117 --> 00:15:45,120
I didn't want to be at my
dad's funeral and have regret

377
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,297
and I felt that it was better
to leave a lot of money

378
00:15:48,297 --> 00:15:50,861
on the table and bet on
myself in the long term

379
00:15:50,861 --> 00:15:52,807
that I would be able to close the gap,

380
00:15:52,807 --> 00:15:55,773
than to have a no
relationship with my father.

381
00:15:55,773 --> 00:15:58,273
And I think for a lot of Asian

382
00:15:59,443 --> 00:16:02,335
youngsters, I feel like the Russian and

383
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:04,542
the Asian family dynamics

384
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:05,835
are far more similar than,

385
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:08,290
let's say a Russian or Asian
dynamic to an American family,

386
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,804
and so, I think a lot of you
are gonna understand that.

387
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,766
I, but I will say this as well,

388
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:18,071
I don't over react either.

389
00:16:18,071 --> 00:16:22,152
I know your parents, like
mine, expected respect.

390
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:25,845
My dad wants respect
just because he's my dad.

391
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:29,280
I think that only goes so
far and so, if you want to do

392
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,944
something that is good for you legacy-wise

393
00:16:31,944 --> 00:16:35,513
and you feel good about when
your parents are no longer in

394
00:16:35,513 --> 00:16:37,538
the picture, I recommend that.

395
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,923
But I think you also have to
draw lines in the sand for your

396
00:16:40,923 --> 00:16:44,621
own pride and your own life
and you have to be okay with

397
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:47,689
making tough decisions and
so I have a lot of empathy

398
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:49,413
on this subject matter.

399
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:51,485
- So, I want to come to VaynerMedia,

400
00:16:51,485 --> 00:16:52,318
because
- Yes.

401
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:53,334
- you are coming to Asia with VaynerMedia,

402
00:16:53,334 --> 00:16:54,167
- Yes.

403
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:56,556
- What inspired you to start
VaynerMedia and what is the

404
00:16:56,556 --> 00:16:58,973
mission and vision of your company?

405
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:00,913
- I want to build the
greatest marketing machine

406
00:17:00,913 --> 00:17:01,746
of all time.

407
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:03,339
I call it the DeathStar of marketing.

408
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:05,700
It's why I created a holding
company and why you'll hear me

409
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,791
start seeing VaynerX
more than VaynerMedia,

410
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,369
because of VaynerMedia is the agency part,

411
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:11,385
but I'm gonna be bubbling
out the publishing part with

412
00:17:11,386 --> 00:17:12,219
VaynerX.

413
00:17:15,344 --> 00:17:16,449
The visual is very simple.

414
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:18,752
I thought I was a unique,
once in a generation,

415
00:17:18,752 --> 00:17:23,300
marketer, I know how ridiculous
of a statement that is,

416
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,223
but I needed to prove it to myself,

417
00:17:25,223 --> 00:17:26,738
whether I was right or not.

418
00:17:26,739 --> 00:17:28,573
And I thought the best way
to do that was to build an

419
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:31,263
infrastructure and a
company around my skill set,

420
00:17:31,263 --> 00:17:33,292
and then what I wanted
to do was buy brands

421
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:35,213
and run it through them.

422
00:17:35,213 --> 00:17:38,455
The Asian aspect of our
expansion and very much this trip

423
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:40,944
is a little bit about getting
acclimated to Singapore

424
00:17:40,944 --> 00:17:43,922
with an ambition to open an office here,

425
00:17:43,922 --> 00:17:45,876
is I just couldn't imagine.

426
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:49,718
Very tough to have a world
domination and not have a play in

427
00:17:49,718 --> 00:17:53,486
Asia. So, as I see the next
30 or 40 years working out

428
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:54,569
in my career,

429
00:17:56,305 --> 00:18:00,627
I was invigorated with
my trip to Hong Kong,

430
00:18:00,627 --> 00:18:04,106
recently and I'm so
excited about this trip.

431
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:06,394
This is the beginning of a two-day trip.

432
00:18:06,394 --> 00:18:11,393
There is just clearly a different
energy in entrepreneurship

433
00:18:11,393 --> 00:18:15,489
and business that is a little
bit more in tune with me.

434
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:18,621
There's a reason why I think
I can only live in New York

435
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:20,658
and even that, and this is
a ridiculous thing to say,

436
00:18:20,658 --> 00:18:25,286
and even at times New York
feels a little slow to me.

437
00:18:25,286 --> 00:18:27,686
So, I'm looking for that energy.

438
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:31,269
That drug of high-intensity,
high-pressure,

439
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:36,407
winner attitude and I feel like
Asia, intuitively I felt it

440
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,260
and it's been confirmed and
I'm excited to see how I feel

441
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,817
in 48 hours but I'm excited about it.

442
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:45,157
- So, I know some of your
customers because I went to the

443
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,622
website. I know Budweiser,
Unilever, Toyota,

444
00:18:47,622 --> 00:18:50,924
young Asia customers but in
specifically in US or Asia

445
00:18:50,924 --> 00:18:53,438
globally, who are your customers?

446
00:18:53,438 --> 00:18:55,464
Yeah, so we have Fortune 500 companies,

447
00:18:55,464 --> 00:18:57,114
Johnson & Johnson,

448
00:18:57,114 --> 00:19:00,158
global Fortune 500 companies
Johnson & Johnson's and Chase

449
00:19:00,158 --> 00:19:02,741
and Budweiser, ABI and Unilever

450
00:19:05,662 --> 00:19:06,542
and on and on and on

451
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:09,924
and so Turner Broadcasting,
a lot of the TV clients out

452
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:11,118
there in the US,

453
00:19:11,118 --> 00:19:14,005
GE, these are major companies
with offices all around the

454
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:17,183
world and a lot of our expansion
is to do with a little bit

455
00:19:17,183 --> 00:19:20,763
of the pressure I feel that we
have to become more global or

456
00:19:20,763 --> 00:19:22,871
we'll become too one-dimensional.

457
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,331
For a lot of these companies,
as you can imagine,

458
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:29,167
America is a huge market but
every day becomes less of the

459
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,928
percentage of the overall business

460
00:19:31,928 --> 00:19:34,594
and so we work with very big brands.

461
00:19:34,594 --> 00:19:37,036
We've built a division
called the Vayner Beta,

462
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:39,029
we've built a division
called VaynerTalent.

463
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:40,935
So, we want to work
with smaller businesses,

464
00:19:40,935 --> 00:19:43,540
because I don't want to lose those roots,

465
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,749
but when we come to Asia
it will be focus first

466
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:47,332
on the Fortune 1000

467
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:53,053
and then call it 2022, 2023,
I can start thinking about how

468
00:19:53,053 --> 00:19:56,637
to service small and medium-size
businesses in the region.

469
00:19:56,637 --> 00:19:59,198
- And the business problems
that your company is trying to

470
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,216
solve for the customers.

471
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:01,712
What are they?

472
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:04,486
- Every company in the world
is overspending on marketing.

473
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:05,334
Everyone of them.

474
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:06,409
- That's a good mission statement.

475
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:10,435
- And so, we would like,
I just want to historical,

476
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:12,363
I just want to be historically
correct that I'm right about

477
00:20:12,363 --> 00:20:13,408
that statement.

478
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:16,497
I know I am and I think in
hindsight I'll win a lot of

479
00:20:16,497 --> 00:20:18,817
points in history.

480
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:21,319
So, we are trying to get our
brands to reallocate their

481
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:24,810
dollars and every market is different

482
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,743
and so the way a Johnson
& Johnson or a Unilever

483
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:30,735
or a Budweiser or a Chase
or Toyota markets in America

484
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:34,435
is gonna be different than the
way they market in Malaysia,

485
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:37,756
or in South Korea and I want
to be great at telling them

486
00:20:37,756 --> 00:20:40,054
what to do with their money
and then produce the pictures,

487
00:20:40,054 --> 00:20:42,557
videos and words that help them achieve

488
00:20:42,557 --> 00:20:43,958
their business goals.

489
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,910
- Cool. So you've just
launched a pair of sneakers

490
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,919
what's that that about?

491
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:52,456
- So, this is a super fun thing
for everybody who's in their

492
00:20:52,456 --> 00:20:53,766
early 40s, like I am.

493
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:57,630
Specially if you had a luxury
of growing up in America,

494
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,262
sneaker culture is very big globally now.

495
00:21:00,262 --> 00:21:03,604
But, I was a child of the 80s
when the Jordan's and Hewings

496
00:21:03,604 --> 00:21:06,452
and the Barkleys and the Larry
Birds and Magic Johnsons,

497
00:21:06,452 --> 00:21:08,980
when sport sneakers became a thing.

498
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,020
I was reached out to by K. Swiss,

499
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,173
about a year and a half ago,

500
00:21:13,173 --> 00:21:16,896
and they said "Look, Adidas
has one by aligning itself with

501
00:21:16,896 --> 00:21:19,979
Kanye, and they've won urban culture.

502
00:21:21,295 --> 00:21:22,795
Obviously Nike and

503
00:21:23,813 --> 00:21:26,507
Under Armor playing in sports culture.

504
00:21:26,507 --> 00:21:30,674
We think of entrepreneurship
is a new pillar of fame,

505
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:33,297
and we think you're the face for it.

506
00:21:33,297 --> 00:21:34,768
Would you consider doing a sneaker?"

507
00:21:34,768 --> 00:21:38,053
Before he finished, Barney, the
president of K. Swiss before

508
00:21:38,053 --> 00:21:40,421
he finished the statement, I said yes.

509
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:41,254
Because it was a win,

510
00:21:41,254 --> 00:21:44,252
I only say yes fast when it's win-win.

511
00:21:44,252 --> 00:21:47,460
The way I saw it is, I also
agree that entrepreneurship

512
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,869
is now on a cultural pedestal
and I don't think it's going

513
00:21:49,869 --> 00:21:52,824
away anytime soon. So, I expect
other entrepreneurs to have

514
00:21:52,824 --> 00:21:56,991
sneakers and for me, being the
first, is always interesting.

515
00:21:57,976 --> 00:22:00,972
So, that was number one and
the number two, if it didn't

516
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:04,737
work, it would be a fun kind
of side-note for me and my

517
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:08,331
buddies to make fun of my
audacity, that I thought I was

518
00:22:08,331 --> 00:22:11,246
cool enough to have a sneaker
and it flopped and I have 5000

519
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,418
pairs sitting in my garage.

520
00:22:13,418 --> 00:22:15,711
- That's interesting.
So, you're in Asia now.

521
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:16,544
- Yes.

522
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:20,292
- I mean, I definitely get the
motivation why you came from

523
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:21,301
the US to Asia.

524
00:22:21,301 --> 00:22:22,134
- Yes.

525
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:23,340
- Since you are in Singapore
and you've also been to

526
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,238
Hong Kong
- Yes.

527
00:22:24,238 --> 00:22:26,441
What are your first
impressions of Asia with these

528
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:27,964
two cities?

529
00:22:27,964 --> 00:22:30,649
- So, my biggest impression
and I've spent a lot of time

530
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,140
also watching from afar.

531
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,044
And when I say watching afar,

532
00:22:33,044 --> 00:22:35,044
signing into wechats and

533
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,660
Q and all these things and so,

534
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:43,370
it's just just a
different level of rawness

535
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,234
that I appreciate.

536
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:49,663
And I don't, I hate when
Americans or Europeans speak to

537
00:22:49,663 --> 00:22:51,856
"Oh the ethics are not as good."

538
00:22:51,856 --> 00:22:54,005
It's all loser talk.

539
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,471
They're coming up with excuses,
I think there is a level of

540
00:22:57,471 --> 00:23:01,763
ambition. A level of perseverance,

541
00:23:01,763 --> 00:23:06,198
and a level of can-do attitude that is

542
00:23:06,198 --> 00:23:08,784
intoxicating for real entrepreneurs

543
00:23:08,784 --> 00:23:11,794
and so that is my first impression.

544
00:23:11,794 --> 00:23:13,803
That people are people are hungry

545
00:23:13,803 --> 00:23:16,804
and now look, I think China

546
00:23:16,804 --> 00:23:20,716
is an incredibly intriguing cloud

547
00:23:20,716 --> 00:23:22,747
and I don't use cloud as a bad thing.

548
00:23:22,747 --> 00:23:25,733
But it is a thing, that I think the

549
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:29,875
Asian market always thinks
about what are they up to.

550
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:33,545
It's a thing and I
think that's intriguing.

551
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:36,656
So, I think it's a little early
for me to make a thoughtful

552
00:23:36,656 --> 00:23:40,758
statement. I bought crypto
currency in 2013 and 14

553
00:23:40,758 --> 00:23:43,257
and I'm still not on the
record on my thoughts on it.

554
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:46,831
So it's tough for me to think
about making my official Asian

555
00:23:46,831 --> 00:23:49,498
POV but, the people have been so

556
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:54,354
disproportionately interesting to me.

557
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:57,469
It's the ambition, the ambition's real.

558
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:00,911
- Yep, I totally agree. So
it comes to the closing.

559
00:24:00,911 --> 00:24:02,813
So I want to ask you two things.

560
00:24:02,813 --> 00:24:05,728
One is, can you recommend
something that has profound

561
00:24:05,728 --> 00:24:08,273
influence in your life in
the form of a book, podcast

562
00:24:08,273 --> 00:24:09,106
or media?

563
00:24:10,346 --> 00:24:12,332
- So, this is a tough question for me.

564
00:24:12,332 --> 00:24:13,574
I'm a very unique guy.

565
00:24:13,574 --> 00:24:16,189
The answer is sure but it's
gonna be a uniquely interesting

566
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:18,976
answer, which is my audience.

567
00:24:18,976 --> 00:24:21,704
So for example, I just
connected from Hong Kong to

568
00:24:21,704 --> 00:24:23,821
Singapore, four hour flight.

569
00:24:23,821 --> 00:24:26,601
I slept, so even though it was
nighttime and I was trying to

570
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:27,723
get tired, what did I do?

571
00:24:27,723 --> 00:24:30,214
The guy next to me is watching a movie.

572
00:24:30,214 --> 00:24:32,329
Other people are doing all
sorts of different things on

573
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:33,492
their electronic devices.

574
00:24:33,492 --> 00:24:37,551
I spent four straight hours
reading comments from people on

575
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:38,552
my content.

576
00:24:38,552 --> 00:24:39,385
- Wow.

577
00:24:39,385 --> 00:24:42,394
- So, I think the reason
that I'm a good culture

578
00:24:42,394 --> 00:24:46,545
consumer-centric strategist
is because I probably spend

579
00:24:46,545 --> 00:24:48,712
more time reading comments

580
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:52,546
than anybody I've ever heard of.

581
00:24:52,546 --> 00:24:54,556
So when I used to talk
about in Thank You Economy

582
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:56,866
and gage, when I talk
about reply to everybody

583
00:24:56,866 --> 00:25:00,486
and things of that nature,
what I didn't realize in 2011

584
00:25:00,486 --> 00:25:04,863
that I now do 2017 was, I
was already reading everyone.

585
00:25:04,863 --> 00:25:08,806
So, the addition of replying,
seemed like a very lightweight

586
00:25:08,806 --> 00:25:12,148
task and that has been
unbelievably effective for me.

587
00:25:12,148 --> 00:25:15,236
So, that has been my
greatest impact on me,

588
00:25:15,236 --> 00:25:17,203
which has been the audience itself.

589
00:25:17,203 --> 00:25:19,564
- So, I will definitely
check up all the comments and

590
00:25:19,564 --> 00:25:20,578
(Gary laughs)

591
00:25:20,578 --> 00:25:22,336
gift drop you a note.

592
00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:23,169
- Please.

593
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:25,692
- So, my last question
is and I think this is

594
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:26,752
from me to you is a dumb question,

595
00:25:26,752 --> 00:25:28,243
how can my audience find you?

596
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:29,643
They can find you almost
everywhere, right?

597
00:25:29,643 --> 00:25:31,318
- Yes, I mean they can.

598
00:25:31,318 --> 00:25:32,235
(interviewer laughs)

599
00:25:32,235 --> 00:25:36,208
ironically one of our big
strategies is also to build out my

600
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:40,066
mainland China profiles
as well, but I would say

601
00:25:40,066 --> 00:25:44,352
Facebook.com/Gary or the podcast is

602
00:25:44,352 --> 00:25:47,693
being consumed unbelievably globally.

603
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:51,004
So, the Gary Vee Audio
Experience and a lot of iTunes or

604
00:25:51,004 --> 00:25:54,581
Google play or Stitcher or
Spotify or things of that nature.

605
00:25:54,581 --> 00:25:57,941
So, or you can Google
or search Gary V-E-E,

606
00:25:57,941 --> 00:26:00,319
usually something will pop up.

607
00:26:00,319 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat rock music)
