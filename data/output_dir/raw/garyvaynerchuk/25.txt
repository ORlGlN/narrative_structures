1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,521
- Over your fears, nobody's
fucking opinion named

2
00:00:02,521 --> 00:00:05,530
Johnnypants49 who says
"you're ugly", should stop

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,148
you from fucking winning your life.

4
00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:10,565
(applauding)

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,129
It's funny, Vayner Media
is super interesting to me.

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,730
I'm building Vayner Media the way I was

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,520
raised and the way, which I
think I really believe this,

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,340
I think you over coddle and

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,490
over love up front.

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,070
You just establish it.

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,330
It's just love.

12
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,730
And you're good, almost
like delirium like blind

13
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:33,467
like you're the best.

14
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:37,340
And then around six, seven,
eight, you start chipping away

15
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,457
at it and start saying
like, "No you're not the

16
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:41,500
"best basketball player," like you're not

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,700
like, and start creating
some realistic part.

18
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,566
But when you establish
like a foundation of

19
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:51,108
who you are, and what my
mom did was, she over-spent

20
00:00:51,108 --> 00:00:53,430
her time conversating about what I

21
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,493
was great at, she made
me have consequences for

22
00:00:56,493 --> 00:00:59,315
what I didn't, and away we went.

23
00:00:59,315 --> 00:01:02,590
- Hello, how are you?
- Whattup vlog?

24
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,212
Good morning Houston, Texas.

25
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:06,670
H-Town mother fuckers!

26
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,150
Uh, got a speech here.

27
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,151
- [Announcer] Gary Vaynerchuk!

28
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:12,568
(applauding)

29
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,890
- I came here today, to inspire you to go

30
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,940
spend 50 hours learning through reading

31
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,910
books, watching videos, downloading

32
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,468
PDF's; I don't know how you learn.

33
00:01:24,468 --> 00:01:26,970
I came here today to inspire all of you to

34
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,240
spend 50 more hours, whether you know this

35
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,211
like Steve, but he should know more.

36
00:01:31,211 --> 00:01:33,946
If I needed to know more,
he needs to know more.

37
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:36,760
Or you've completely dismissed this,

38
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,370
because you're fucking
Summer and you think

39
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,480
you can beat this, this
is a fucking tidal wave!

40
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,116
Do you know what happens when you stand

41
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:45,548
up to a tidal wave?

42
00:01:45,548 --> 00:01:49,970
I'm finding a surfboard and
riding it to the sunset,

43
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,440
you think your tough

44
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,420
and you're gonna get fucking annihilated.

45
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,130
Please go put in the 50
hours of work of learning,

46
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,150
please download every
fucking one of these apps,

47
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,796
start tasting them and learning it.

48
00:02:00,796 --> 00:02:02,610
Get over your fears.

49
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,943
Nobody's fucking opinion named

50
00:02:03,943 --> 00:02:06,790
Johnnypants49 who says
"you're ugly", should stop

51
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,520
you from fucking winning your life.

52
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,770
(cheering)

53
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,370
I have a bunch of business calls and then

54
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,805
off to Super Bowl.

55
00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:19,280
Tonight, we have our,
our party which is the

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,370
Entrepreneur Magazine
and Vayner Sports party

57
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,070
of the top entrepreneurial athletes.

58
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,682
For a lot of people here, you've willed

59
00:02:24,682 --> 00:02:27,980
this into success; like a lot more than

60
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,030
you'd ever really imagine.

61
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,700
Like, hard work is an
unbelievable variable.

62
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,510
You know I get, I'm getting shit on quite

63
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,350
a bit right-and I've been very careful

64
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,470
in clarifying over the
last 24 months, depending

65
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,940
on how long you've been
following me of like

66
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,520
no, no I sleep six, seven
hours, but I'm more focused on

67
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,910
the other 18, because it's true!

68
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,103
Like I sleep, it's just that
I'm on fire because I'm happy.

69
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:51,853
(dramatic music)

70
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,050
I'm from fucking Belarus, baby!

71
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:04,878
Whattup Target?

72
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:06,128
Whattup Target?

73
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,062
So we're going into the
party here, in Minnesota.

74
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:14,060
Vayner Sports party with
Entrepreneur Magazine.

75
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,170
Uh, really, really excited
about it, it should

76
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,080
be really great.

77
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,559
We're very focused on the
best entrepreneurial athletes;

78
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:20,930
we're giving away some awards, doing

79
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,258
a fireside chat, looking forward to it.

80
00:03:23,258 --> 00:03:25,376
- [Man] Are you excited about
your first Super Bowl party?

81
00:03:25,376 --> 00:03:29,446
- Yeah, this is like super
interesting, right, like

82
00:03:29,446 --> 00:03:32,814
passion uh, I've fallen
in love with the industry.

83
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:35,846
I mean, when I see the
Entrepreneur logo and you know,

84
00:03:35,846 --> 00:03:37,160
it's one of those things when you

85
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,770
grow up from humble
beginnings and you have

86
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,200
passions; if you would
have shown me this picture

87
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,665
of us two, those two
logos, you know I would

88
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:45,435
have been like, "What?"

89
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:50,020
You know, and so it's super,
uh, it's super humbling.

90
00:03:51,626 --> 00:03:54,376
(dramatic music)

91
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:09,882
You know, I think it's a
million variables, but most

92
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,770
of all, I respect where the attention is.

93
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,930
- So you need to tell me, how you as

94
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,892
entrepreneurs, are going to elevate the

95
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:21,120
vibration of the collector
of your community?

96
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,790
- For me, uh, I've penetrated
youth culture because

97
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,860
I understand Snapchat,
and Instagram, and YouTube

98
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,090
and all those things way
better than any person

99
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,250
in this room.

100
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,083
(laughs)

101
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:34,933
- Or in the world.

102
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:38,274
- And what I've done, is
I've gotten in very early

103
00:04:38,274 --> 00:04:41,892
and I'm pushing very tried and true

104
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:46,307
work ethic, kindness, gratitude, patience.

105
00:04:46,307 --> 00:04:49,430
And watching 15, you know
getting DM's from kids

106
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,250
who are like, "Yo just
6 months ago I'm just

107
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,165
"laying in my bed doing
drugs all day listen to

108
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:57,257
"this, that, and the other
thing and you've, you

109
00:04:57,257 --> 00:04:59,610
"got into my stream, you got me looking at

110
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,210
"different shit and this
is where my life's at."

111
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,150
The way I'm looking to
elevate is I'm looking

112
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,000
into getting in real early
and I'm trying to, through

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,809
sheer force, build
popularity so that kindness

114
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:15,223
and gratitude and empathy
become cool things, instead

115
00:05:15,223 --> 00:05:18,362
of putting cash to your
fucking ear or having

116
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:20,630
ice on your fucking wrist.

117
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:24,395
(applauding)

118
00:05:28,855 --> 00:05:31,960
Yo, whattup Batman asked
me to close it out.

119
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,380
This is my favorite meme!

120
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,996
Vader Sports party went
well, we're going to Tao, um,

121
00:05:35,996 --> 00:05:40,350
we can't show that, and so
uh we're wrapping it up.

122
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,367
Big day tomorrow, reading
the audio, I came to

123
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:44,901
Super Bowl weekend to read
my fucking audio book so

124
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:47,270
I can get it out sooner for you fuckers.

125
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,310
So, I got you!

126
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,143
I got you!

127
00:05:49,143 --> 00:05:53,450
And special guest in the back,
Patrick show em, show 'em!

128
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,380
There he is!

129
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,966
There's no fucking light, who's got light?

130
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:57,099
Show this man!

131
00:05:57,099 --> 00:05:58,390
Tell him he's got it!

132
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,990
Uh, uh, uh!

133
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,980
The team baby let's go,
K-Swiss for life baby!

134
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,814
K-Swiss for life!

135
00:06:04,814 --> 00:00:00,000
(dramatic music)
