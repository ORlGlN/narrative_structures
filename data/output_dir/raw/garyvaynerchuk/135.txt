00:00:01,961 --> 00:00:03,071
- You recording?

3
00:00:03,071 --> 00:00:04,767
(whistling)

4
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:05,958
Something's about to happen.

5
00:00:05,958 --> 00:00:07,440
(radio static)

6
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,032
Madison Square Garden, New York City.

7
00:00:10,032 --> 00:00:13,611
Feeling the vibes for real,
like for fuckin' real.

8
00:00:13,611 --> 00:00:14,707
Gonna be a good one.

9
00:00:14,707 --> 00:00:15,708
Real good.

10
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,375
(hip hop beat)

11
00:00:22,372 --> 00:00:25,179
- [Host] In addition to running
digital agency VaynerMedia,

12
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:29,091
Gary also serves as CEO of
holding company VaynerX,

13
00:00:29,091 --> 00:00:31,155
which houses VaynerMedia and The Gallery,

14
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:33,499
a new publishing company that he started

15
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:37,523
after acquiring leading women's
lifestyle property PureWow.

16
00:00:37,523 --> 00:00:39,219
Mister Gary Vaynerchuk!

17
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:42,386
(audience applauding)

18
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:44,649
- [Gary] New York!

19
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:46,065
Madison Square Garden!

20
00:00:46,065 --> 00:00:47,273
(robotic noises)

21
00:00:47,273 --> 00:00:48,561
And so I implore all of you to

22
00:00:48,561 --> 00:00:49,947
take a step back.

23
00:00:49,947 --> 00:00:53,090
And realize that whatever
excuse you're gonna tell me,

24
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,025
that your parents were alcoholics,

25
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:56,952
that you were molested as a child,

26
00:00:56,952 --> 00:00:59,090
that you grew up in a shit country,

27
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,617
that you didn't have a
mentor when you were a kid,

28
00:01:01,617 --> 00:01:03,377
I respect the piss out of that,

29
00:01:03,377 --> 00:01:04,828
and I believe it.

30
00:01:04,828 --> 00:01:06,057
Do I believe that there are

31
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:07,418
advantages for being white males?

32
00:01:07,418 --> 00:01:08,778
Of course I do.

33
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:09,977
It's black and white.

34
00:01:09,977 --> 00:01:12,625
But do I also recognize that

35
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:15,841
if anybody that looks
like you ever made it,

36
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:18,002
that that needs to be an important debate.

37
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:20,481
And do I realize, even more importantly,

38
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:22,657
that every one of you can be practical

39
00:01:22,657 --> 00:01:24,889
and pay your dues

40
00:01:24,889 --> 00:01:27,123
being a single mom
taking care of three kids

41
00:01:27,123 --> 00:01:28,507
but still,

42
00:01:28,507 --> 00:01:29,889
the fact,

43
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:33,242
the fact that you can lay in bed at 10 PM

44
00:01:33,242 --> 00:01:34,441
to one in the morning,

45
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:36,225
and do shit on this

46
00:01:36,225 --> 00:01:39,105
is so fucking mind-boggling

47
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:42,817
and is so fundamentally
disrespected as a collective

48
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:44,369
in this room,

49
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,041
that I implore you to
take one big step back

50
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:50,698
and realize that grammy
didn't have it this good.

51
00:01:50,698 --> 00:01:51,641
You have to do the right things,

52
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:53,297
and you have to eat shit!

53
00:01:53,297 --> 00:01:55,047
You have to eat shit.

54
00:01:55,964 --> 00:01:57,913
Guys, get into eating shit!

55
00:01:57,913 --> 00:01:59,002
(audience laughs)

56
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:00,419
I mean it though, I mean it!

57
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:01,252
I mean it!

58
00:02:01,252 --> 00:02:03,593
I worked all of my 20's and early 30's.

59
00:02:03,593 --> 00:02:05,593
Like, I didn't buy stuff,
I worked every hour,

60
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:06,777
I didn't do anything cool,

61
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:08,858
and I was building my
dad's business for him!

62
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:10,408
I ate shit!

63
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:11,745
Real shit!

64
00:02:11,745 --> 00:02:13,225
Stinky-ass shit!

65
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:14,058
You know?

66
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:16,250
And I see everybody trying
to get there so fast.

67
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,806
You wanna have a great
mentor as a youngster?

68
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,141
Find somebody you admire,

69
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:21,599
and bring them 100 percent of value for

70
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,273
six and a half years and
then see how it plays out.

71
00:02:24,273 --> 00:02:26,086
Six and a half years.

72
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:27,537
Because when you're 28 and a half,

73
00:02:27,537 --> 00:02:29,307
you're still young as fuck!

74
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:30,580
- The next question is

75
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,106
how do you stay motivated
after a setback or failure?

76
00:02:34,106 --> 00:02:36,773
- 'Cause what's the alternative?

77
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:41,915
(audience applauding)

78
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:43,377
The fuck's the alternative?

79
00:02:43,377 --> 00:02:44,210
How do I feel motivated?

80
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,080
'Cause 400 trillion to one!

81
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,112
Gratitude,

82
00:02:47,112 --> 00:02:48,859
I'm thankful for what I have

83
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:50,121
whenever I had something.

84
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:51,058
I love when people are like,

85
00:02:51,058 --> 00:02:51,891
easy for you now.

86
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:53,076
No!

87
00:02:53,076 --> 00:02:54,570
From the get!

88
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,232
I cried when I got two Star Wars figures

89
00:02:56,232 --> 00:02:57,520
instead of one when I was six

90
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,680
because I couldn't
believe my parents could

91
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,906
afford to do that!

92
00:02:59,906 --> 00:03:02,114
I'm grateful, I'm grateful!

93
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:02,947
Gratitude!

94
00:03:02,947 --> 00:03:03,896
Gratitude!

95
00:03:03,896 --> 00:03:06,479
Somebody's always got it worse.

96
00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:09,139
And as long as that's the case,

97
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:09,972
then I'm good.

98
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:11,122
And don't forget,

99
00:03:11,122 --> 00:03:12,997
I like setbacks!

100
00:03:12,997 --> 00:03:14,329
I want them to judge me!

101
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:16,516
I'm actually weirdly
kind of romantic about

102
00:03:16,516 --> 00:03:17,934
having a pretty big setback.

103
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:18,780
I don't play that way.

104
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,990
I'm far less risky than people realize,

105
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,476
the way I work but

106
00:03:22,476 --> 00:03:24,764
I'd be excited in a weird way

107
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:25,940
if I had a big setback

108
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,604
because then everybody would
starting writing shit like,

109
00:03:27,604 --> 00:03:28,687
oh I knew it.

110
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:30,855
See?

111
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:31,688
See?

112
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:33,486
That would so motivate me!

113
00:03:33,486 --> 00:03:35,525
Because rising back up like a phoenix,

114
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:37,651
and then sticking it
to their fucking mouth

115
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,054
would be phenomenal.

116
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:42,721
(audience laughs, applauds)

117
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:44,832
- When you have a setback,

118
00:03:44,832 --> 00:03:45,752
is there

119
00:03:45,752 --> 00:03:46,652
a process to go through?

120
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:47,644
- 100 percent!

121
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,700
- What is your process of trying--

122
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,116
- I think about what
the fuck just happened,

123
00:03:51,116 --> 00:03:52,764
I try to understand what happened,

124
00:03:52,764 --> 00:03:54,612
and I try not to do it again!

125
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:57,069
(audience laughs)

126
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,164
- Seems easy enough.

127
00:03:58,164 --> 00:03:58,997
- Yeah!

128
00:03:58,997 --> 00:04:01,809
Guys, all of you are in
meetings and PowerPoints

129
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:05,392
and making structure
for excuses to not do.

130
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:08,117
I have five minute meetings because

131
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:10,684
most meetings take five minutes.

132
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,423
I don't need to bullshit for seven,

133
00:04:12,423 --> 00:04:14,237
eat some celery for three,

134
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:16,866
make a joke about Karen for five

135
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:20,284
and dick around for another eight.

136
00:04:20,284 --> 00:04:21,451
Get shit done!

137
00:04:22,516 --> 00:04:25,638
This is all about what's
going on in your own head.

138
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:27,581
This is all about how you play.

139
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:28,581
I'm insular.

140
00:04:29,484 --> 00:04:32,458
My level of zero give-a-fucks

141
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,547
about your opinion

142
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:34,715
is extraordinary.

143
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:35,566
Wow,

144
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,864
I wanna do the behavior that really maps

145
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:41,171
to you saying nice things about me.

146
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:42,251
You know?

147
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:43,387
Like everybody's just

148
00:04:43,387 --> 00:04:47,666
Just, not in control 'cause
they're not in their own head.

149
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:48,747
I'm insular.

150
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,404
And so, when I make a mistake, I own it.

151
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:52,627
And I really own it.

152
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:53,699
I'm not pointing fingers.

153
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,476
If somebody on my team made the mistake

154
00:04:55,476 --> 00:04:56,507
which happens every day,

155
00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:58,174
I hired that person!

156
00:04:59,196 --> 00:05:02,363
I empowered that person
to make a decision!

157
00:05:02,363 --> 00:05:04,108
And so, I own my shit.

158
00:05:04,108 --> 00:05:04,941
Period.

159
00:05:04,941 --> 00:05:06,466
Scarlet letter for fuckin' days

160
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:07,475
and I wear it proudly.

161
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:08,308
What?!

162
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,636
What's your fuckin' opinion about it?

163
00:05:09,636 --> 00:05:10,469
Fuck you!

164
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:12,523
(audience laughs)

165
00:05:12,523 --> 00:05:13,586
Let's do one more.

166
00:05:13,586 --> 00:05:14,419
- Okay.

167
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:15,914
(audience laughs)

168
00:05:15,914 --> 00:05:18,354
When do you quit your job, and go all in?

169
00:05:18,354 --> 00:05:20,212
- When do you quit your job and go in?

170
00:05:20,212 --> 00:05:21,898
When you can afford it!

171
00:05:21,898 --> 00:05:22,731
Happiness

172
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:26,330
is so unbelievably addictive.

173
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,170
And it makes me so sad

174
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,259
that so many of you created
golden handcuffs for yourself

175
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,594
that aren't letting you leave your job,

176
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:36,370
because you need to make
130 thousand a year now

177
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,219
'cause you wanted 700 more
square feet in your apartment,

178
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:42,474
or you wanted a BMW instead of a Toyota.

179
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:44,314
And so you're not happy

180
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:46,538
because you wanted two or three things

181
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:48,955
that mean absolutely nothing.

182
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,539
I promise you when you've tasted both,

183
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:55,234
when you meet people
that have tasted both,

184
00:05:55,234 --> 00:05:58,576
I make 180 thousand a
year and I have stuff,

185
00:05:58,576 --> 00:05:59,724
but I'm not happy,

186
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:02,410
and then I went making 94 thousand a year

187
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,530
but I'm doing what I love,

188
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,405
and I'm super happy and I
have a little less stuff,

189
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:10,178
it is not even close to a debate.

190
00:06:10,178 --> 00:06:11,693
So I implore all of you

191
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:14,339
to really dig deep inside of yourselves,

192
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:16,619
and try to figure out
why you need that stuff.

193
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm gonna save you time.

194
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,659
You're trying to close an insecurity gap.

195
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:22,610
Let me give you another huge hint.

196
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,506
Everybody else sucks shit too,

197
00:06:24,506 --> 00:06:25,339
so do you.

198
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:28,994
Hey guys, just gave my first talk ever at

199
00:06:28,994 --> 00:06:30,386
Madison Square Garden in the theater.

200
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:33,266
Next up, the whole fucking Garden.

201
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:35,090
Anyway, it went really well.

202
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,236
I'm super happy with it.

203
00:06:36,236 --> 00:06:37,962
I'm sure you guys will
see it at some point

204
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:39,295
in its entirety.

205
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:41,803
Talked about some other stuff,

206
00:06:41,803 --> 00:06:43,526
had a little different cadence.

207
00:06:43,526 --> 00:06:46,212
Same old shit, but a little bit different

208
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:47,870
which kinda makes it fun, so

209
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,667
D-Rock was solidly into it.

210
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,243
Baban liked it more.

211
00:06:52,243 --> 00:06:55,912
That's mainly why I like
Baban more than D-Rock.

212
00:06:55,912 --> 00:06:56,745
Right?

213
00:06:56,745 --> 00:06:59,108
You like Baban more
than D-Rock too, right?

214
00:06:59,108 --> 00:07:00,062
(laughs)

215
00:07:00,062 --> 00:07:00,895
You know what it is?

216
00:07:00,895 --> 00:07:01,728
D-Rock's got a big head.

217
00:07:01,728 --> 00:07:02,686
Let's call it what it is.

218
00:07:02,686 --> 00:07:04,230
- [D-Rock] I don't
- Zack, you agree, right?

219
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,255
No, D-Rock, you do, you do!

220
00:07:05,255 --> 00:07:08,315
This is real, some people say it!

221
00:07:08,315 --> 00:07:09,637
- [D-Rock] You don't
listen to people though.

222
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,643
- No no, but they're right.

223
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:11,723
- [D-Rock] You block it out.

224
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:12,883
- No, I say it

225
00:07:12,883 --> 00:07:15,523
(group laughs)

226
00:07:15,523 --> 00:07:17,419
[Gary] I'm speaking here in a little bit.

227
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:18,252
Hey brother.

228
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:19,085
- Hi.
- How are you?

229
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:20,269
- I'm good, how are you?
- Good to see you.

230
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:21,102
Vlog,

231
00:07:21,102 --> 00:07:22,381
this man right here,

232
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:24,568
literally one of my favorites.

233
00:07:24,568 --> 00:07:26,254
Obviously there's been
a ton of influencers,

234
00:07:26,254 --> 00:07:27,879
thought leaders, personalities that I've

235
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,118
interacted with in the last decade,

236
00:07:29,118 --> 00:07:30,958
but we don't get to spend
a ton of time together

237
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,026
because we're both doin' our thing.

238
00:07:33,026 --> 00:07:35,097
But hey, he looks great.

239
00:07:35,097 --> 00:07:36,175
Seriously, dude!

240
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:37,230
You look a lot better,

241
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,254
you always kinda looked good.
- I look better?

242
00:07:39,254 --> 00:07:40,087
- No no!

243
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:41,485
You always looked good
but you've tightened it up

244
00:07:41,485 --> 00:07:42,677
a little here, a little here

245
00:07:42,677 --> 00:07:43,605
(laughs)
a little here,

246
00:07:43,605 --> 00:07:44,438
I mean, pretty good, man!

247
00:07:44,438 --> 00:07:45,271
He's looking great!

248
00:07:45,271 --> 00:07:46,994
Listen I gotta

249
00:07:46,994 --> 00:07:48,159
I gotta say the truth.

250
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,289
Anyway, nonetheless

251
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:51,380
really one of my favorite guys.

252
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,291
As a matter of fact,

253
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,123
has an incredible show

254
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:55,323
but I was on it

255
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:56,700
on Chase Jarvis Live

256
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,331
four years ago, maybe?

257
00:07:58,331 --> 00:08:00,173
And it's very difficult to listen.

258
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:01,781
It's why Facebook created EdgeRank

259
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,725
and doesn't allow you to
see everything, right?

260
00:08:03,725 --> 00:08:05,797
That was fat Gary.

261
00:08:05,797 --> 00:08:06,727
(laughs)

262
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:08,704
And I'm just a fan.

263
00:08:08,704 --> 00:08:10,375
And so if you don't know what he's doing,

264
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,208
make sure you follow him up.

265
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,302
Baban, let's make sure
we link all his stuff up.

266
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:14,142
(kisses)

267
00:08:14,142 --> 00:08:16,398
(audience applauding)

268
00:08:16,398 --> 00:08:17,412
[Gary] Thank you.

269
00:08:17,412 --> 00:08:18,245
And I think that,

270
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:19,332
in the creative field,

271
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,936
the thing that has hurt so
many people I care about

272
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:24,710
is they want to rest on experience

273
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,639
or awards that are arbitrary, by the way.

274
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,556
Or, degrees or something
other than the market.

275
00:08:32,452 --> 00:08:33,966
You may not like it,

276
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:36,466
but the market always chooses.

277
00:08:37,427 --> 00:08:39,034
- So,

278
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:40,556
if I'm going to pick up on
that direct for a second,

279
00:08:40,557 --> 00:08:41,534
I think

280
00:08:41,534 --> 00:08:44,396
that's part of what I meant in

281
00:08:44,396 --> 00:08:45,701
when I was beat,

282
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:47,531
what would be absorbed?

283
00:08:47,531 --> 00:08:48,987
And I think there's also this

284
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,859
dramatic hesitation that

285
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:52,895
a lot of people say,

286
00:08:52,895 --> 00:08:54,427
I can't do this, I'm not this,

287
00:08:54,427 --> 00:08:57,006
there's some punk who's 17 years old

288
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:59,356
with a camera and she's gonna kick my ass.

289
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:02,276
And you're giving away trade secrets and

290
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,064
it's unfair.

291
00:09:04,064 --> 00:09:05,188
(Gary chuckles)

292
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:07,477
And I think as photographers,

293
00:09:07,477 --> 00:09:09,470
when I came into the
industry a long time ago,

294
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,757
it was very much closed.

295
00:09:10,757 --> 00:09:11,972
It was about secrets.

296
00:09:11,972 --> 00:09:13,428
And I'm not gonna bring in

297
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:17,556
an assistant, because
they're gonna learn from me.

298
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:19,447
And they're gonna learn
my special lighting stuff

299
00:09:19,447 --> 00:09:20,795
and then they're gonna go out and then

300
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:22,099
they're gonna use that against me

301
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:23,180
to take money.

302
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,403
I've literally had

303
00:09:24,403 --> 00:09:25,570
death threats.

304
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:30,621
I'm not trying to over-dramatize it, but

305
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:31,837
- Well you're a pretty bad guy.

306
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,030
(audience laughs)

307
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,863
I'm just kidding.

308
00:09:33,863 --> 00:09:37,191
- From people who've said
that I'm taking money by

309
00:09:37,191 --> 00:09:38,736
CreativeLive even giving away

310
00:09:38,736 --> 00:09:41,260
three or four billion
minutes of free education.

311
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,253
And

312
00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:44,132
- The internet has given away way more.

313
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:45,957
- Yes, for sure.
- This is like

314
00:09:45,957 --> 00:09:49,013
I don't understand what
people are debating.

315
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:51,133
Information has been commoditized.

316
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,358
You have to wrap your head around it.

317
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,191
- Yeah.

318
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:54,024
- That's just what,

319
00:09:54,024 --> 00:09:56,421
you're more than welcome
to live in your own head,

320
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:57,733
and create excuses.

321
00:09:57,733 --> 00:09:59,621
The problem is, nobody gives a fuck.

322
00:09:59,621 --> 00:10:03,144
Let me say something that
might be a huge unlock.

323
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,591
99 percent of people don't do anything

324
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:08,451
about the free information.

325
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:10,439
The reason I give away all my best stuff

326
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:12,212
is 'cause nobody does anything about it

327
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:14,564
which leaves plenty for me to still do.

328
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:15,718
(audience laughs)
- And for the one percent

329
00:10:15,718 --> 00:10:17,620
that do, those become your new friends.

330
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,292
Those are your peers, the people you love!

331
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:21,500
- Let me tell you one other
thing about those one percent.

332
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,799
They were gonna win anyway.

333
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:26,676
You can't stop winners
from winning, my friends.

334
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:29,002
And then you can educate
the other 99 percent,

335
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:30,591
and get all the admiration

336
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:32,277
and leave a wonderful legacy,

337
00:10:32,277 --> 00:10:34,036
and live a fulfilled life.

338
00:10:34,036 --> 00:10:35,356
That's the model.

339
00:10:35,356 --> 00:10:38,084
Be in the yes business.

340
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:39,356
Instagram, yes.

341
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:40,613
Filters, yes.

342
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:41,860
Going live, yes.

343
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,162
Snapchat, yes.

344
00:10:43,162 --> 00:10:44,372
TBH, yes.

345
00:10:44,372 --> 00:10:46,162
Yes, yes, yes.

346
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:49,162
Why are you so fancy with your time?

347
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,020
Really, you don't have time for this

348
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,843
but yet, you have the ambition to get the

349
00:10:53,843 --> 00:10:57,091
luxuries that come along
with being independent?

350
00:10:57,091 --> 00:11:00,267
We do not map our actions to our mouths.

351
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:02,075
If you have aspirations to win,

352
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:04,988
to crush it, to do it the
way you want to do it,

353
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:06,684
you need to be in the yes business.

354
00:11:06,684 --> 00:11:08,067
I at this point have

355
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,371
achieved enormous things,

356
00:11:10,371 --> 00:11:12,949
and every day I deploy
humility to download a new app

357
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:14,020
and taste it.

358
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,225
Yet, I see creatives always saying no.

359
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:17,877
And they come up with
some arbitrary bullshit

360
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,457
of why it's not pure.

361
00:11:19,457 --> 00:11:22,495
And then they get run over.

362
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,788
(audience applauding)
Thank you guys.

363
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:28,212
(hip hop beat)

364
00:11:28,212 --> 00:11:29,045
- [Man] You guys all peace-in'?

365
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:29,878
- [Gary] Peace-in'.

366
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:30,711
Let's go.

367
00:11:30,711 --> 00:11:31,544
You want to take a quick photo?

369
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:33,310

Phenomenal day.

Great, great day.

387
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:02,827
D-Rock liked the second one better.

388
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:03,747
But he had the weird angle.

389
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:05,195
You weren't even like, looking at me!

390
00:12:05,195 --> 00:12:06,028
Baban, where were you?

391
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:06,861
The other angle?

392
00:12:06,861 --> 00:12:07,694
- Yeah.

393
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:08,527
- Thank God.

394
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:09,662
Anyway, great day.
