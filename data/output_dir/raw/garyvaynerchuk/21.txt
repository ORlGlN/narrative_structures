1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:01,332
- She's special.

2
00:00:01,332 --> 00:00:02,602
She really is, man.

3
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,030
She's like gonna win.

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,030
Let me help.

5
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,280
Like, you're gonna win.

6
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,250
Like, for real, like honestly.

7
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,620
You know what's running
through my mind right now?

8
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,690
Straight up?

9
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,220
I'm like, I am so happy
I have that on film,

10
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,200
'cause one day, you're
gonna be the biggest star

11
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,510
in the world and I'm just
gonna keep putting out the clip

12
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,019
where you're like, "Wow, he's the best."

13
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,080
(laughing)

14
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,020
- [Tierra] Hi, I'm
really glad to meet you.

15
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,842
- Hi. I am so excited right now.

16
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:25,785
- [Tierra] Yes.

17
00:00:25,785 --> 00:00:27,758
- My man, I'm Johnny.
- This is Johnny, manager.

18
00:00:27,758 --> 00:00:29,505
- Johnny, how are you?
- Kineet, manager.

19
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:30,580
- Kineet, how are you?
- Hi.

20
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,850
- Tatiana, make-up artist.
- Hi, Tatiana.

21
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,860
- We're all fans, I'm sorry.

22
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,750
And then Nick, my photographer.

23
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,485
- Nick, how are you?

24
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:36,318
No worries, I'm super flattered.

25
00:00:36,318 --> 00:00:37,151
Get in here.

26
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:38,360
I'm so excited for this meeting.

27
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,546
- Yup, me too.

28
00:00:39,546 --> 00:00:40,748
Can I sit right here?

29
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:42,930
- Yeah, sit, sit, sit anywhere.

30
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,778
There's plenty of seats for everybody.

31
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,262
I'm glad you came up.

32
00:00:46,262 --> 00:00:48,401
Were you coming up anyway today, or?

33
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:50,775
- Yeah, I have like a press run tomorrow.

34
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:53,150
All the blogs have been
posted, mumbo jumbo,

35
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,570
just like, we wanna meet so yeah.

36
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,585
- You are going to be a
ridiculously big star.

37
00:00:57,585 --> 00:00:58,418
It's super weird.

38
00:00:58,418 --> 00:01:00,639
Like, you know what's crazy for me?

39
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:03,477
This is now happening
to me mainly in hip hop.

40
00:01:03,477 --> 00:01:07,003
Like that Uber email you
see over there, right?

41
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:11,500
These stocks, Twitter, Tumblr,
like what I wrote about

42
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,580
in my first book about like social media.

43
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,120
It's so crazy, I didn't know that I--

44
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,610
I feel like now I have one
core talent which is like

45
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,756
I can see it and like it
used to be about like trends,

46
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:29,766
or like companies and now
I've been really focused

47
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:34,230
for about a year hard on like hip hop.

48
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,600
And like, it's really interesting.

49
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,530
Honestly, Mike really helps
me but not everything,

50
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,120
like there's a lot of things
that I see that I'll be wrong.

51
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,510
Or like I won't fuck with
something that becomes enormous.

52
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,976
But some stuff is just black
and white obvious to me.

53
00:01:50,976 --> 00:01:54,391
Man, I really think you're--
I'm really excited for you.

54
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:55,224
- That makes me feel really good.

55
00:01:55,224 --> 00:01:56,070
- And what's interesting is I haven't--

56
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,530
I've lived like nobody being on Twitter.

57
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,170
Like I was on YouTube when nobody was--

58
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,010
like there was not one video
that had a million views

59
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,460
on YouTube when I started.

60
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,510
Like, and so I've watched people
like never saying the word

61
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,060
social media or YouTube or Twitter.

62
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,860
So that's been cool, right?

63
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,010
And I did it with wine
which is way less cool,

64
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,980
like with like New Zealand
wine and South African wine,

65
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,840
but I'd never done it with people.

66
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,650
And now I'm doing it with people.

67
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,230
So now I'm like, "Man,
what would it be like

68
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,120
"if I was doing this six years ago

69
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,580
"and like The Weeknd
was just sitting here?"

70
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,413
(laughing)

71
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:28,320
Right?

72
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,370
I'm like, "That's gonna be
a weird feeling, right?"

73
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,319
Anyway, nonetheless, I am
so intrigued by your talent.

74
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,583
- Thank you so much.

75
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,416
Thank you, I can't.

76
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,720
- I was so pumped when you hit me back

77
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,750
and were like, "We're
fans", I was like, "Yes!"

78
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,425
(laughing)

79
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:47,140
- [Nick] We were pretty excited.

80
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,650
- We were so surprised when you told us.

81
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,850
I was like, "Oh my God,
I can't believe this."

82
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,760
Like we just, we was looking
at each other like shocked.

83
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,560
Like, "What the fuck? Oh my gosh."

84
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,890
- It's so crazy, right?

85
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,230
Like I know it's happening,

86
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,360
like I don't get ahead of myself,

87
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,069
but I'm like wow, if you
would have ever told me--

88
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:02,430
I mean, you have to understand, I'm 42.

89
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,559
Like, if you would've
told me 13, 15 months ago

90
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:09,482
18 months ago, that my
co-sign would mean anything

91
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:10,888
in any shape or form...

92
00:03:10,888 --> 00:03:13,500
(group laughing)
...it's just so funny for me.

93
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,300
It's like an out of
body experience, really.

94
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,418
So what's going on? What's going on?

95
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:21,190
- Really, I'm just working
on this new project.

96
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,230
I don't know, I've been
working on it for a while.

97
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,567
Just like me in general,
like I'm just kinda like,

98
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,400
I'm just like, I'm scatterbrained.

99
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,060
Like I have like, I think of ideas

100
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,480
like every second of the
day and like these two

101
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,580
like they help me really
to just kinda like

102
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,430
just balance it and you
know just like give me

103
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,806
like some type of direction and of course,

104
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:40,902
just organizing like
the things in my head.

105
00:03:40,902 --> 00:03:43,340
So like it was our idea to just like

106
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,752
put together like, well to
try to put the way I feel

107
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:49,410
into music of course,
'cause that's what I do.

108
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,740
- Tell me more about yourself.

109
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,652
Where were you born?

110
00:03:51,652 --> 00:03:53,315
- Myself? I was born in Philadelphia.

111
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:54,148
- What part?

112
00:03:54,148 --> 00:03:55,410
- North. North Philly.

113
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,885
Yeah, so this kinda like,

114
00:03:56,885 --> 00:03:58,870
they're trying to make it good now.

115
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,750
They had like-- Temple
has taken over everything.

116
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,850
- I know, I know.

117
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,460
- The things that I
saw when I was younger,

118
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,293
it's not there anymore.

119
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:06,019
It's just like a nice ass
building now, so but yeah so.

120
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:08,704
- It was not as nice of a
building when you were growing up.

121
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:12,050
- Yeah, yeah, like so, yeah
so it changed and whatever.

122
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,060
But single parent, my mom,
just she took care of me.

123
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,269
- You have siblings?

124
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,079
- Yes, I have a younger
brother and younger sister.

125
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,329
We're all five years apart,

126
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,759
so I'm kinda like setting like the tone,

127
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,335
like I'm doing good and they
have to follow right along.

128
00:04:24,335 --> 00:04:25,168
You know what I mean?

129
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:26,878
I'm setting the standard, so yeah.

130
00:04:26,878 --> 00:04:29,377
- And when did you know
you were music-ed out?

131
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:32,282
- Well, really, like I
kinda always just loved.

132
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:35,464
Like at first I wanted to
be a dancer then I was like,

133
00:04:35,464 --> 00:04:38,440
I was singing a little bit
then my aunt got me in church,

134
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,370
so I was like, "Okay, I really like this."

135
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,280
But then I got in school,
I forgot what grade it was,

136
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,300
but we got introduced to
poetry and it was like we had

137
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,430
to get up in front of the class.

138
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,340
This was like the first time
we had to get up and present

139
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,460
and all of my friends, we
were so-- I was nervous

140
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,600
you know it was like, "Oh
my God, we gotta like--".

141
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,880
And it was just, I think it
was called freestyle poem

142
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,160
or like spoken word or
something like that.

143
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,370
That was like the specific
thing that we had to do.

144
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,570
And she was like, you know,

145
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,900
"You just get up here and
just express yourself."

146
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,340
It has to be a page long or
whatever and everybody did it.

147
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,040
I was the last to go
up, 'cause my last name

148
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,836
was always on the roster
'cause it's Whack.

149
00:05:09,836 --> 00:05:10,669
- I got V.

150
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:13,097
- Yeah, V, yeah, so you
understand what I mean.

151
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:13,930
- I know how it is.

152
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,588
- Yeah, you understand what I mean.

153
00:05:15,588 --> 00:05:16,790
- This is literally my exact story.

154
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,500
In sixth grade, I had to
give a speech in class.

155
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,780
And I went last so I had
to fuckin' be nervous

156
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,921
the whole time and I wasn't
the public speaker I am today,

157
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:27,270
'cause I had to like talk
about shit I didn't care about.

158
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,103
- Right, yeah.

159
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:29,180
- It wasn't as cool as what you did.

160
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,650
I had to like, you know, like nonetheless.

161
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,483
So I know. Keep going.

162
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:36,040
- Yeah, so, like I went last
or whatever and like the poems

163
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,840
were so like, I didn't
really like poetry at first.

164
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,610
I liked the fact like my mom had me--

165
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,999
Like I had The Cat in the Hat, Dr. Seuss,

166
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:44,131
One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, you know.

167
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:45,983
But like I just like certain poems,

168
00:05:45,983 --> 00:05:48,054
they just don't make any sense to me.

169
00:05:48,054 --> 00:05:50,175
But I just love the fact of just like

170
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:52,170
that you can rhyme any word that you--

171
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,930
Of course it has to rhyme but
we just put words together.

172
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,763
I just love that.

173
00:05:55,763 --> 00:05:56,596
I'm so fascinated by that.

174
00:05:56,596 --> 00:05:57,429
- [Gary] Right from the beginning?

175
00:05:57,429 --> 00:05:58,356
- Yeah, from the beginning.

176
00:05:58,356 --> 00:06:00,663
- [Gary] So you did your thing.

177
00:06:00,663 --> 00:06:02,630
And it went over really well?

178
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,500
Like right out the gate?

179
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,180
- Like the kids in class were just like,

180
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,500
"Yo, you gotta like turn it into rap.

181
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,590
"Do rap, do rap, do rap."

182
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,423
And I'm just like, "What?"

183
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:10,730
I just you know, but I like the attention,

184
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,691
because for awhile I
just went through a thing

185
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:15,890
where I was getting teased and everything,

186
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,540
like just, I never got any attention.

187
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,650
- [Gary] It was the
first time you got love.

188
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,320
- Yeah so I was like, "Oh,
this is what they like?"

189
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,800
And then I was like, "Mom, get ready."

190
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,048
Yeah so I got two composition
books and by month two,

191
00:06:25,048 --> 00:06:28,040
I just had like every day I was
coming to school with lunch,

192
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,680
and I was controlling everything
like everybody get ready,

193
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,234
get their lunch, sit at the table,

194
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:34,744
and I'm just spitting these raps.

195
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:37,290
Just like poems, but they
were turning into raps

196
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,560
and it just went crazy and
you know like neighborhood--

197
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,393
- [Gary] How long ago was that?

198
00:06:41,393 --> 00:06:42,902
- That was like, it was like,

199
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,240
- [Gary] Were you in high school?

200
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,230
- No, no, no, middle
school, middle school.

201
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,440
Yeah, middle school so--

202
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,920
- [Gary] Okay, nonetheless,
now I got the picture.

203
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,900
So, and then what happened?

204
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,030
- So then after that, I just kinda like--

205
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,117
the composition books
really just helped me,

206
00:06:55,117 --> 00:06:57,400
'cause I had to make my mom
go out and get the books.

207
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,680
She's like what do you
want these books for?

208
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,513
You already have school books.

209
00:06:59,513 --> 00:07:00,870
And I'm like, "No, I want to write poems."

210
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,450
And then she started seeing
how thick they were getting

211
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,100
and how I kept going
back to the Dollar Store

212
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,510
to get new books and she was like,

213
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,610
"Oh okay, you're on to something."

214
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,300
So then I had an uncle, you know he--

215
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,570
I guess she told him or something like,

216
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,830
"Yeah, she's been doing
poetry or whatever."

217
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,702
'Cause you know you meet your family,

218
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:15,832
and they're like "Well,
what are you doing?"

219
00:07:15,832 --> 00:07:17,160
and she's like, "Oh, she writes."

220
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,310
And so then he was like, "Oh
you should try it over a beat.

221
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,860
"And you gotta talk about stuff that--

222
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,710
"you know, like the streets."

223
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,220
So I went up and I looked at like the most

224
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,725
gangsterest rappers and I
started talking about stuff like

225
00:07:27,725 --> 00:07:30,604
fucking pilling your
scout back and shooting,

226
00:07:30,604 --> 00:07:33,810
stabbing your mom and like
you know but I feel like it--

227
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,730
I still say some of that stuff
but I feel like the way--

228
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,260
'cause that's literally what
my mind think, you know.

229
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,490
But like you know, I was just,
I went through that phase

230
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,140
of just trying to figure
out like I want to be cool

231
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,710
to like the hood 'cause that's
where I was in the hood.

232
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,270
You know, like that's
what I want to talk about.

233
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,627
But really I wanted to
talk about dinosaurs.

234
00:07:48,627 --> 00:07:49,621
Yeah, right yeah.

235
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:52,040
But then it's like so I went
through that whole thing

236
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,820
with just trynna like you know--

237
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,500
- Conform?
- Yes! Yes.

238
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,510
And it was so difficult but
I just had to accept it.

239
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,870
I was like, people would
literally call me weird

240
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,742
and I hated it.

241
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:02,862
- Yeah but you know what?

242
00:08:02,862 --> 00:08:04,550
You got so lucky because
if you were coming up

243
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,130
on a different era, that
would've been the only option.

244
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,290
This is the best time
to be in hip-hop ever,

245
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:13,440
'cause it's a mature state
like you know what's funny?

246
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,300
I've seen the exchange
between you and Yotti

247
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,820
and I always use him as an
example of this exact point,

248
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,260
which is that if Yotti
came out like that when

249
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,411
I was growing up, he
would've got his ass kicked.

250
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:24,782
(laughing)

251
00:08:24,782 --> 00:08:26,869
I always say that it's
crazy to me that like

252
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:31,364
Ice Cube and Urkel had sex
and made the new age rapper.

253
00:08:31,364 --> 00:08:35,090
Right like if you would've
told me that's what would've

254
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,610
happened 20 years ago, I
would've never believed it.

255
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,280
But it's so amazing that you
can be your authentic self.

256
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,951
A female with your angle on
things and it's like hot.

257
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:50,117
Uh, it's why I wish people
understood hip-hop better.

258
00:08:50,117 --> 00:08:55,000
It's gone from really not accepting,

259
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,020
like in a lot of ways in my opinion,

260
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,920
to unbelievably accepting
in its current form.

261
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:02,780
- [Mike] One thing you said recently,

262
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,196
so the next part of her story is--

263
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:07,520
I don't know how long you were in Atlanta,

264
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,998
but at some point, she was like

265
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:11,870
"I'm not just rapping to
rap, I want to be an artist."

266
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,537
- Yeah, so that happened.

267
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:16,190
That was like, so middle school happened.

268
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,070
It was just poetry, poetry.

269
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,271
And then I went to high
school and then I started

270
00:09:20,271 --> 00:09:23,220
this random thing, like
just going into high school

271
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,010
like my first year, 9th grade.

272
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,736
Me and my mom were just driving,

273
00:09:26,736 --> 00:09:28,040
we were going to visit my grandma,

274
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,260
my grandma's in heaven now, rest in peace.

275
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,670
We were driving down like
North Philly same thing

276
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,650
and she was like, "Look."
and then I looked up

277
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,020
'cause I'm kinda like,
my chair was always back.

278
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,930
I didn't wanna like be out.

279
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,760
I had homework, projects,
I was stressed out.

280
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,410
It was just like 9th grade year.

281
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,989
I'm just like, "What the fuck?"

282
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:44,597
- The first year of high school sucks.

283
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:46,670
- Yeah, so what happened?

284
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,563
Oh so I looked to my right
and I see a big group of guys

285
00:09:49,563 --> 00:09:52,195
just on the corner just random
and I see like a nice camera.

286
00:09:52,195 --> 00:09:54,308
Like that looks like
a beautiful like yeah.

287
00:09:54,308 --> 00:09:57,190
No but it looked Canon, you know yeah.

288
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,470
So I'm like, "Okay, this
kinda looks like official."

289
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,725
You know but I'm still
kinda like in my mood.

290
00:10:02,725 --> 00:10:04,172
Like I don't, you know--

291
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:05,270
'cause my chair was
literally back like this.

292
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,867
And then she was like, "You
should get out and rap."

293
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:09,416
I'm like, "What? I can't just do that.

294
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,400
"Like what do you mean?"

295
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,567
And she's like, "No, get out and rap."

296
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:15,920
So she knows me so she can
tell that I'm thinking.

297
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,970
And I'm just like--

298
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,260
And she's like, "Alright,
I wanna circle the block."

299
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,100
So she circles the block and
I'm thinking of all the raps

300
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,779
I have in my head and then I get out.

301
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:25,698
I was like, "Aye yo, can I rap for y'all?"

302
00:10:25,698 --> 00:10:27,100
(laughing)

303
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,316
They was like, "Yeah."

304
00:10:28,316 --> 00:10:29,810
And then I was just like, "Hi."

305
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,840
They like, "What's your name?"

306
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,340
"Well they call me T-Dizzle."

307
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,030
'Cause they just called me
T-Dizzle and it was like

308
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,110
just neighborhood stuff
like whatever so that's just

309
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,870
the first thing in my
head that I thought of.

310
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,360
So they're like, "Alright,
go ahead shorty."

311
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,935
So I'm like, "Hey, yo."

312
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:43,970
And then I just was rapping and they like,

313
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,000
they were looking like, "I'm
not really feeling this."

314
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,070
And then this one guy, he's
not here, rest in peace.

315
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,460
He just put his arm
around me, he was like,

316
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,980
"No, like she's hot.
Like y'all gotta listen."

317
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,790
So I guess he ran that whole block.

318
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,000
So once they like--

319
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,870
'Cause they were kinda like
backing away a little bit like,

320
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,610
"She kinda weird, she's
talking about dukies

321
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,354
"and booties and just weird, whatever."

322
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:04,930
Yeah and he saw it and
once he put, he literally--

323
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,763
You can see the video.

324
00:11:05,763 --> 00:11:06,840
You can still find the video on YouTube,

325
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,673
- Oh yeah?

326
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,678
Yeah, he put his arm around me.

327
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:12,068
- Oh that's cool.

328
00:11:12,068 --> 00:11:13,457
Yeah, I wanna see that bad now.

329
00:11:13,457 --> 00:11:14,983
Actually pull it, go get it.

330
00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:16,330
(laughing)

331
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,367
- No, not while I'm still here.

332
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,210
Yeah, oh you were on Hot Ones?

333
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,043
Did you go?

334
00:11:21,043 --> 00:11:22,730
- I did and dominated by the way.

335
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,880
- Oh wow, I love spicy food.

336
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,713
- Go watch it.

337
00:11:24,713 --> 00:11:26,220
I completely annihilated that show.

338
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,600
- Okay, yeah we gotta watch it.

339
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,670
Okay so he's like, "I'm
rocking, I'm rocking with her."

340
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,056
And then that's when I found out like,

341
00:11:34,056 --> 00:11:36,970
'cause I got the information from the dude

342
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,360
who was holding the camera
and he had done like a popular

343
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,950
like blog and you know
he had a good webpage,

344
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,050
it's called "We Run The Streets",
that's what it's called.

345
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,070
So like the rappers like Meek
Mill coming up, Three Dollars,

346
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,220
like all the battle
rappers were coming up,

347
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,740
you know on his platform or whatever

348
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,521
so I was like, "Oh my
God, I can't believe it."

349
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:56,680
It was just so good and then he's like,

350
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,310
"Yeah shorty, I wanna put it up tonight.

351
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,310
Receive the feedback."

352
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,200
And then it was like one night 6,000 views

353
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,440
then like a week it was like 12,000,

354
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,760
it just kept jumping like so
good and then he was like,

355
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,420
"Yo, you didn't have any buzz
and like this is going crazy."

356
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,520
And of course it was like,
"15-year-old jumps out

357
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,510
"and blesses the camera
with her mom in the car",

358
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,030
or something like that, like
that was the whole thing.

359
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,590
So after that, Meek tweeted
me, like Cosmic Dirty,

360
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,720
all the big people, all
the big heads from Philly

361
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,140
just like were tweeting
me and I'm just like,

362
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,980
"Yo, this is not happening."

363
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,060
Like I just couldn't believe it.

364
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,602
- And then everybody in school was like--

365
00:12:27,602 --> 00:12:29,930
that must've been crazy.

366
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,630
- Yeah but see the
thing was like you know,

367
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,090
that was just so random, you know,

368
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,570
me just not even wanting
to be outside and you know,

369
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,529
be in that car like,
and then it just was--

370
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:39,200
And then in school, I was a problem.

371
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,243
My principal, she hated
me, I know she did.

372
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:43,910
I just controlled everything
like whatever I said,

373
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,238
like it just went like you
know like just whatever.

374
00:12:46,238 --> 00:12:48,074
- You had too much juice?

375
00:12:48,074 --> 00:12:50,539
- Yeah, I did, no literally I did.

376
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:53,834
And so then like you
know, I just was going

377
00:12:53,834 --> 00:12:56,270
on the radio shows
freestyling, freestyling.

378
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,040
But I just got tired of
that like I was going

379
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,019
into the stuio sessions and
just rapping over a beat

380
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:05,250
that you know, weren't
original just like killing it.

381
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,820
But I mean of course, I'm
just trying to get a buzz

382
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,640
so I'm doing what I got to--

383
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,420
- You're honing your craft,
you're getting exposure,

384
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,530
you're going through the process.

385
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,460
- Exactly so but it just like--

386
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,260
I told you I have a
short-ass attention span,

387
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,640
so it just got boring really
fast, you know what I mean?

388
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,510
So I just was like, I wasn't feeling it,

389
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,430
like people were calling
like they were signing

390
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,186
and all this stuff and whatever.

391
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:25,790
Meek was trying to figure
something out and I'm just like,

392
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,770
"Eh, I'm not really feeling it."

393
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,957
I had been in sessions and everything

394
00:13:28,957 --> 00:13:30,118
but I'm just like, "I don't know.

395
00:13:30,118 --> 00:13:31,240
"I don't wanna just freestyle
like my whole life."

396
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,780
You know what I mean?

397
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,430
'Cause every time I would
try to even just dibble,

398
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,960
you know into like something
original, everyone's like,

399
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,700
"No, just kill some beats, just
kill some old school beats."

400
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,910
And I'm like, "That's cool but I don't--"

401
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,390
Like I just started to get stressed out.

402
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,280
And you know the only person that really

403
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,870
understood me was like my mom.

404
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,930
Like I was telling my
friends, they're like,

405
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,303
"What do you mean?

406
00:13:49,303 --> 00:13:50,136
"You have the hottest people calling you

407
00:13:50,136 --> 00:13:51,400
"and just do what they want you to do."

408
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,850
Once somebody said that
to me, I was just like,

409
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,050
"Nah, I can't do this."

410
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,119
So me going through that,

411
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:59,090
and then this was like 11th grade year.

412
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,979
Yeah this was like all
happening 9th, 10th, 11th,

413
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:03,800
when like everything was
like happening for me.

414
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,322
And so my mom was like,

415
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:07,360
"You know, I'm thinking about moving.

416
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,330
"I want something new or whatever."

417
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,800
And I was like, "I need something new."

418
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,269
And that's when we moved to Georgia.

419
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:15,667
- You moved to Georgia
for your senior year?

420
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:16,780
- For my senior year, yeah.

421
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,863
I finished my last year of high school.

422
00:14:18,863 --> 00:14:23,845
So I stayed there with her for
about two and a half years,

423
00:14:23,845 --> 00:14:26,470
like almost three years and I just kinda,

424
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,750
I deleted social media,
this is when I was going

425
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,510
by a different name, T-Dizzle,
Dizzle-Dizz, whatever.

426
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,500
And deleted social media, I
just was trying to find myself.

427
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,280
You know what I mean, like I'm
just trying to figure it out.

428
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,600
And what happened?

429
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:40,750
Well when I went, this is
funny 'cause when I went down

430
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,100
to Georgia, people already
knew who I was in school

431
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,130
like so that's how I knew
that it was like serious.

432
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,280
Of course I'm in Philly and
like everybody knows who I am.

433
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,210
But when I went to Georgia and seen like,

434
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,664
"Oh that's the girl, I think."

435
00:14:50,664 --> 00:14:52,290
Every time I'm walking in a hallway,

436
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,123
"That's the girl. That's the girl."

437
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:54,896
And I'm just like, "Oh my God."

438
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:56,366
I thought I was gonna get away from it,

439
00:14:56,366 --> 00:14:58,450
but I'm still in it and so but eventually,

440
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,080
I got my first job, it was a car wash.

441
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,970
I worked in a car wash, Mister Hot Shine.

442
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,780
And I was making so much money.

443
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,700
So like tips were fucking crazy.

444
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,500
I didn't even care about
my check like just like,

445
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,340
my tips were so crazy
and I was the only girl,

446
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,810
like everybody else was like
they had just got out of jail,

447
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,730
I was working with all guys, killer like--

448
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,926
fucking everybody was crazy
there but I was the only girl

449
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:19,140
and I was just getting tips so good.

450
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,990
I loved that job but my
goal was I wanted to save up

451
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,651
for my first laptop and a mic,
that's what I wanted to do.

452
00:15:25,651 --> 00:15:29,674
So yeah, I worked that job,
got my laptop and a mic.

453
00:15:29,674 --> 00:15:32,780
I just start recording myself
and I was finding little beats

454
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,700
and everything 'cause I could
use my buzz a little bit

455
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,690
to like you know, reach out to
certain people like you know,

456
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,694
we producing this stuff and
yeah, we just started like

457
00:15:39,694 --> 00:15:43,330
start doing some original
stuff and like I just kept it

458
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:46,030
to myself on that laptop
and then when I felt like

459
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,390
I was starting to get
it, 'cause I was like,

460
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,223
"I gotta change my name.

461
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,760
"I wanna use my real name, Tierra Whack."

462
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,900
Like I was making a master plan,

463
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,059
just trying to reinvent myself.

464
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:55,950
- Being patient?

465
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,357
- Yes, but it was so much like pressure

466
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,448
because everybody in my
corner was telling me

467
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:04,490
like they didn't want me to do what I did.

468
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,272
They didn't want me to take that break.

469
00:16:06,272 --> 00:16:07,811
- That's when you know it's right.

470
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:09,387
- Yeah, you know and so yeah.

471
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:12,826
And so like a year and a
half, almost two years.

472
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:16,610
'Cause yeah it went by
whatever and I was still just

473
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,070
recording on the laptop and I
started to just feel confident

474
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,130
but I didn't show anybody any of my music,

475
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,770
so that's kinda crazy to just you know,

476
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,470
like I had to just keep
this like to myself.

477
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,860
- You were the case of the other version.

478
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,050
- Yeah, exactly.

479
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,880
- You didn't have the impatience
that everybody else had.

480
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,500
You were already in a
place where everybody

481
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,030
heard everything you were
doing so it was easier for you

482
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,980
in a lot of ways to keep it to yourself

483
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,733
'cause you knew what the alternative was.

484
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:43,697
You've gotten the digital exposure,

485
00:16:43,697 --> 00:16:46,250
you got radio station exposure.

486
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,440
So okay, so keep going.

487
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,910
- So that's when I
called this guy, Kineet.

488
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,735
So when I was T-Dizzle,
(laughing) I used to hop around

489
00:16:55,735 --> 00:16:59,160
studio sessions all over
Philly, just trying to just find

490
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,443
that right engineer you
know, until it feels right.

491
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,579
This guy is really, he's like really hard

492
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:07,829
to like get connects
with, he's like a caveman.

493
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,019
You have to really be
like good or like just

494
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,720
something special about
you so that's why I know

495
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,945
that I'm special like he reminds me.

496
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:16,469
Like I called, I got in touch with him

497
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,900
because I remember I had so many sessions,

498
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,000
I had this one session and
it was of course with him

499
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,500
and I got one really
good original song done.

500
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,180
Out of all the fucking sessions I did,

501
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,920
it was so fucking many, I always
did freestyles, freestlyes.

502
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,150
I went in the studio
with him and he was like,

503
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,650
"Yo, you could do original if you want."

504
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,720
I was like, "What?"

505
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,410
Like that was like the first
engineer that said anything

506
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,290
like that in Philly for
me and I'm just like,

507
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,203
"So you don't mind if I like, you know,

508
00:17:39,203 --> 00:17:40,620
I could work on original stuff?"

509
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,480
He's like, "Yeah, you can
do whatever you want to do."

510
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,507
So I always remembered that and I said--

511
00:17:44,507 --> 00:17:46,859
Keep in mind I was still
in Georgia thinking this,

512
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,040
like the whole plan right.

513
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,700
So I connected with him on Instagram like,

514
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,580
"Yo, I got some new stuff.

515
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,570
"I really need you know
an ear or whatever."

516
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,850
And like I said, I kept in mind.

517
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,210
I'm sorry, I'm like backtracking,

518
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,070
trying to make sure I'm saying everything.

519
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,782
- [Gary] You're not losing
me at all, just so you know.

520
00:17:59,782 --> 00:18:00,870
(laughing)

521
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,838
New York has become slow for me.

522
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:04,482
(laughing)

523
00:18:04,482 --> 00:18:08,158
This shit feels in slow
motion, just so you know.

524
00:18:08,158 --> 00:18:10,049
- That's good, that's good.

525
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:11,581
- [Gary] Know where you're sittin'.

526
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:13,261
This is slow motion, go ahead.

527
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:14,910
- So I always kept him in mind
but I knew he was hard to get

528
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,440
in contact with so I had to
make sure before I physically

529
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,390
moved back to Philly that I had
him on lock like I have him.

530
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,180
"You're the first person I
wanna see when I get to Philly."

531
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,460
So he hit me right back and
he's like, "Yo, where you been?"

532
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,860
Like what everybody's been asking.

533
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,416
"Where have you been?"

534
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,068
It's been two years
since I put anything out.

535
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:29,272
I was a leader and everything.

536
00:18:29,272 --> 00:18:30,343
He's like, "Where have you been?

537
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:31,412
Yeah, come through man.

538
00:18:31,412 --> 00:18:32,657
"You know we could work something out."

539
00:18:32,657 --> 00:18:33,490
So I'm like, "Yes, this is all I need."

540
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,070
Like as an artist, if you have
an engineer in the studio,

541
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,940
you can do anything, you know what I mean?

542
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,973
So I got back with him, played my stuff

543
00:18:39,973 --> 00:18:41,311
and I was so fucking happy.

544
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:42,420
- [Gary] You came up to Philly?

545
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,253
- Yeah, I came back to Philly.

546
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:44,717
I moved back to Philly with my grandma.

547
00:18:44,717 --> 00:18:45,760
- [Gary] Oh, you moved back?

548
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,880
- Yeah I moved back, I was back so--

549
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,830
- [Gary] Your grandma who's passed?

550
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,000
- No, not that one.

551
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,250
This is Wilma Whack.

552
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,737
Wilma Whack is still
alive, she's fucking crazy.

553
00:18:51,737 --> 00:18:53,554
- [Gary] Okay, so go
grandma Wilma Whack okay.

554
00:18:53,554 --> 00:18:55,351
(laughing)

555
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:58,300
And you go play to him, you're nervous,

556
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,966
you're hoping it goes
well and what happens?

557
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:02,160
- He loves it, he loves it like--

558
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,384
- [Gary] And when was this?

559
00:19:03,384 --> 00:19:08,222
- This was about three,
three or four years ago?

560
00:19:08,222 --> 00:19:11,576
It was about three or
four years ago and she--

561
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:13,806
I like cued who she was at
that point 'cause I'm like,

562
00:19:13,806 --> 00:19:16,871
I started calling her Dizzle
and she had changed her name

563
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:20,000
to Tierra Whack already so she
would check me immediately.

564
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,833
- [Gary] She's like, "I'm Whack."

565
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,320
- Yeah, don't call me that.

566
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,590
And I'd slip up 'cause I'm
so used to calling her Dizzle

567
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,480
but she don't, but she sent it to me

568
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,740
and she's like, "Whatchu think?"

569
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,946
I'm like, "This is crazy."

570
00:19:29,946 --> 00:19:33,877
It was like way different from
what you were doing before.

571
00:19:33,877 --> 00:19:36,869
And you know--

572
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:41,119
(laughing and overlapping chatter)

573
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:46,095
- [Gary] So he's blown
away and what happens next?

574
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:47,930
- And then I mean, I don't
wanna say it gets dry,

575
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,140
but it's just like we just
started working and he's like,

576
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,990
"Yeah, you can record
here whenever you want."

577
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,870
Like he literally like
moved his sessions over

578
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,150
and like just let me--

579
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,705
- So you created a project?
- Yes.

580
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:59,170
- And what happened? When did you drop it?

581
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,003
- No, no, no.

582
00:20:00,003 --> 00:20:02,550
There still is no project
after all these years.

583
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,140
He just, like he's like,
"Yo, you can come in."

584
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,436
And he even showed me--

585
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:06,808
- He started teaching you?

586
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:08,060
- Yeah, he started
teaching me how to record

587
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,800
on a better pro tone and
logic and everything.

588
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,490
He was like, "Yo, I'll lock out a time.

589
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,340
You can just go ahead."

590
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,974
And he would literally
leave me in the studio,

591
00:20:15,974 --> 00:20:16,807
just let me just clock out.

592
00:20:16,807 --> 00:20:19,123
Yeah, 'cause that's what
I was doing on my laptop

593
00:20:19,123 --> 00:20:19,956
so I guess he wanted to ease me into it,

594
00:20:19,956 --> 00:20:22,441
which was the best plan
ever and then you know,

595
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:25,580
we just like, I've just
touched in so many genres,

596
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,290
because he just gave me
that like the playing field.

597
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,123
Yeah, the freedom.

598
00:20:29,123 --> 00:20:30,590
- Do what you want.
- Yeah.

599
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,463
- That's what you do with
talent, you don't box 'em in.

600
00:20:34,463 --> 00:20:35,892
- Yeah, it wasn't like,

601
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:38,435
"Nah, you gotta do this or make this.

602
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:39,802
It was like, "She's seen a lot."

603
00:20:39,802 --> 00:20:40,760
- You're like, "You know."

604
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,320
- Yeah, like yeah.

605
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,677
- So and then like, I don't know.

606
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:48,650
That's really like the yeah.

607
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,378
- Yes, that's sort of the gist of it.

608
00:20:51,378 --> 00:20:53,780
And then what happened was I know myself,

609
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:58,185
I don't like, I'm not that
good at being in the forefront

610
00:20:58,185 --> 00:21:00,840
and I know that like
sometimes it can mess up

611
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,176
somebody else's situation
by not acknowledging

612
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:05,480
who it is that you are.

613
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,940
- Self-awareness is a leverage, baby.

614
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,620
- Right so I'm like, "She might
need, she want management."

615
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,770
I'm like, "Yeah, I could."

616
00:21:15,995 --> 00:21:18,640
So I had him, who I've been
working with for awhile.

617
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,955
- I knew him too already.

618
00:21:19,955 --> 00:21:21,970
- That's why I'm like,
"Johnny's good with business."

619
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,793
I'm not good with any--
of course, I'm tech-savvy.

620
00:21:24,793 --> 00:21:28,146
But yeah, yeah so it
became all three of us.

621
00:21:28,146 --> 00:21:31,230
- And when was that,
around that same time?

622
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,130
- Yeah, around the same exact time.

623
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:35,872
- And what's been happening
for the last three years then?

624
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,187
- Just everything.

625
00:21:37,187 --> 00:21:40,113
So many people calling and just like--

626
00:21:40,113 --> 00:21:42,168
- [Johnny] We've been being patient

627
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:44,841
for the last three years,
that's exactly what.

628
00:21:44,841 --> 00:21:46,095
- Yeah, that's really what it is.

629
00:21:46,095 --> 00:21:47,910
Like just like knowing the
right time to just like,

630
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,650
you know like drop here
and there and just like--

631
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,974
- When you have the talent,
you have the leverage,

632
00:21:52,974 --> 00:21:56,470
your moment doesn't pass when you're good.

633
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,278
Like people are so confused.

634
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:02,466
- [Mike] When did everyone
start like Bibi Bourelly

635
00:22:02,466 --> 00:22:05,818
who we really mess with
and liking her pictures?

636
00:22:05,818 --> 00:22:08,657
You know what I mean, like
when did all this stuff?

637
00:22:08,657 --> 00:22:10,555
- I don't know who that is, why?

638
00:22:10,555 --> 00:22:12,487
- You don't know who that is?

639
00:22:12,487 --> 00:22:13,700
She wrote, "Bitch Better
Have My Money" for Rihanna.

640
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,138
- Oh that's who, okay, it
sounded by I wasn't sure.

641
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:19,765
- And she liked your photo and Kei.

642
00:22:19,765 --> 00:22:22,028
You know Kei, 21 Savage's manager?

643
00:22:22,028 --> 00:22:23,300
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

644
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,822
She hit me up, yeah, yeah.

645
00:22:24,822 --> 00:22:27,212
- Coach K likes everything she does.

646
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:31,436
(laughing and overlapping chatter)

647
00:22:31,436 --> 00:22:34,058
But you know what I mean?

648
00:22:34,058 --> 00:22:37,110
- As he should, Coach K's doing his thing.

649
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,346
- Everyone's watching you.
- Yeah.

650
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:41,516
- I think now is the time right?

651
00:22:41,516 --> 00:22:42,378
- Yeah, yeah.

652
00:22:42,378 --> 00:22:44,622
- Like what do you feel about--

653
00:22:44,622 --> 00:22:48,380
- You know what's crazy
about "Now is the time."

654
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,405
Like for what?

655
00:22:49,405 --> 00:22:52,488
So now is the time. Cool.

656
00:22:52,488 --> 00:22:55,240
Like this is my whole
point, like this what--

657
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,070
I ever heard for the past
10 years of my life is

658
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,470
"Now is the time."

659
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,720
I wrote this, "Now is the time."

660
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,250
This now, "Now is the time."

661
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,220
You get the better question to your point

662
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,080
in the way you're looking
at it, that's right.

663
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,240
But I think the much more
interesting question is

664
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,452
"Do you at this moment have a sense

665
00:23:09,452 --> 00:23:11,680
"of what you want to happen?"

666
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,303
And if you don't, then it's
just to continue to create."

667
00:23:15,303 --> 00:23:18,560
Right, so like to me,
TV was always the time.

668
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,798
TV, I was like, everybody was like,

669
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:23,490
"Time is the time. This is the time."

670
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:26,580
And I didn't know what I
wanted and then when Apple

671
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,794
came along with a show where
it had three big celebrities

672
00:23:29,794 --> 00:23:33,434
and then me, I knew that it
wasn't gonna be a big show

673
00:23:33,434 --> 00:23:36,230
'cause I knew nobody
had Apple TV like that.

674
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,850
I just knew me positioned
with those three incredible

675
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,010
celebrities that were A-list for the group

676
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,880
that wouldn't know about it
'cause I knew I could make

677
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,660
people know about it, wasn't
even like about like you know,

678
00:23:48,686 --> 00:23:51,840
I just wanted like just being
with Jessica, Will.I.Am,

679
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,821
and Gwyneth Paltrow for Hollywood,

680
00:23:53,821 --> 00:23:55,760
put me on a different sphere.

681
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,660
It didn't matter what happened next.

682
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,753
That was the right time.

683
00:23:59,753 --> 00:24:02,757
And so for me was a huge win even though

684
00:24:02,757 --> 00:24:05,609
it didn't become Shark
Tank or American Idol.

685
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:09,480
It was a beat of beat, it was an industry.

686
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,810
It was the people that--

687
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:13,480
like I'm in a different
mindset for a lot of people,

688
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,770
on a different level for different people,

689
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,100
not that I need that
'cause I'd much rather have

690
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,410
three million followers on
Instagram than be on a TV show.

691
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,070
I needed it for the leverage
of other shit I may want to do.

692
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,580
- Right, okay, yeah.

693
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,413
- Got it?

694
00:24:27,413 --> 00:24:29,770
So you're in it already when people

695
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,363
that matter are liking your content.

696
00:24:32,363 --> 00:24:34,500
Here you come along, you discover it,

697
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,300
or we're looking at it
from a different way,

698
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,164
you know and you go and look.

699
00:24:38,164 --> 00:24:41,098
Well then she's already
won that narrative.

700
00:24:41,098 --> 00:24:44,770
Like when people go online
and see The Rock liked it,

701
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,603
they're like, "What?"

702
00:24:45,603 --> 00:24:47,300
You know like right?

703
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,398
So for me, there's a
different thing which is

704
00:24:50,398 --> 00:24:53,201
the different and right question for me is

705
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:55,379
"What do you want to happen next?"

706
00:24:55,379 --> 00:25:00,379
- Can I tell you like the
process kind of or just like--?

707
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,280
- [Gary] You can tell
me anything you want.

708
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,697
- (laughing) No, you
didn't hear what I said.

709
00:25:04,697 --> 00:25:05,960
Okay, I said I was
pregnant but I was playing.

710
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,010
- [Gary] I heard you.

711
00:25:07,885 --> 00:25:09,338
(laughing)

712
00:25:09,338 --> 00:25:10,210
If you were pregnant,
that's some real weird shit.

713
00:25:11,516 --> 00:25:12,349
(laughing)

714
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:14,930
- Okay, so like it's funny

715
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,590
'cause we touched on this awhile ago.

716
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:22,510
I'm just kind of in a space
where like I don't give a fuck

717
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,500
like I just don't, like I just can't,

718
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,180
like I can't afford to care
because sometimes of course,

719
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,130
when you care, you overthink
and you think too much,

720
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,285
and it's just like something
driving you so crazy.

721
00:25:32,285 --> 00:25:33,959
- [Gary] You know what's crazy?

722
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:35,110
You don't give a fuck and you don't care

723
00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:38,350
because you've hit full maximum caring.

724
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,514
- Oh, that's perfect, that's perfect!

725
00:25:40,514 --> 00:25:43,284
Yeah, that's exactly what
it is and it's just like,

726
00:25:43,284 --> 00:25:46,640
I'm just kinda just whatever
comes to my table and like

727
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,120
to my plate, I'm just kinda
like, "Let's figure this out."

728
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,370
- [Gary] I'm listening
to you very carefully

729
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,620
and I've been really
listening to you carefully

730
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,050
in a different way and
now listening to you here.

731
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:58,430
I think the only thing you
need to decide is the--

732
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:03,080
so your stuff is so right, it's scary,

733
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,823
which is why all this is
happening, your stuff.

734
00:26:05,823 --> 00:26:08,960
The only conversations the
three, four, five of you

735
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,919
should be having is, in the short-term,

736
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,937
"Where do we put that stuff?"

737
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:18,615
So when I hear what you're up
to like what you wanna do next

738
00:26:18,615 --> 00:26:21,007
I'm like, "That's exactly right."

739
00:26:21,007 --> 00:26:24,400
Because that's where you
want to put your stuff.

740
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,200
- Okay, okay.

741
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,580
- Got it? Like that's how I feel.

742
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,549
Everything I do is gonna be right.

743
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,890
I just have to decide
where I want to put it

744
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,120
and sometimes I wanna
put it in a paper cup

745
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,070
but sometimes I wanna put
it filling an entire room.

746
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,068
You're gonna always be right creatively,

747
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:45,342
you just need to think about
the context of the distribution

748
00:26:45,342 --> 00:26:47,291
and what you want to happen.

749
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:48,124
- Right.

750
00:26:48,124 --> 00:26:50,077
- I feel like also like Tierra,

751
00:26:50,077 --> 00:26:52,770
one of the reasons why she
like doesn't give a fuck about

752
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,690
anything anymore and like what
you were just saying before

753
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:57,960
is 'cause like she doesn't
notice all these outside things.

754
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,710
Public victory is about accomplished.

755
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,890
She just had so much a
personal victory like she's had

756
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,000
so many like wins on the
inside and everything,

757
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,384
she's just like isn't ever
thinking about anything else

758
00:27:05,384 --> 00:27:06,870
and now she just needs to get in--

759
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,520
- My man, I don't know
anything that anybody's doing.

760
00:27:10,492 --> 00:27:13,527
(laughing)

761
00:27:13,527 --> 00:27:15,130
People ask me shit all the--

762
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:18,169
I know what's going on
through other people's eyes.

763
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,650
I know what's going on in the streets

764
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,260
'cause I can see it through scale,

765
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,157
through his eyes and
through the feedback I get.

766
00:27:24,157 --> 00:27:27,040
Like I spend time with you
guys 'cause I can almost

767
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,620
like weirdly like it's so
weird like I don't even

768
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,735
like talking about how I
learn, like I feel like

769
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:35,250
on some like weird superhero movie shit.

770
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,720
You guys come in here and I like take it.

771
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,589
Like it's so weird how I do it,

772
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:44,720
which just means I don't
know what anybody's doing.

773
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,250
I don't know about anything.

774
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,758
I know what it feels like to
be in your own little cocoon.

775
00:27:49,758 --> 00:27:52,048
What I do think you need to do,

776
00:27:52,048 --> 00:27:55,220
what I do think the
vulnerability to our system is,

777
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,760
is where you put it and why.

778
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:04,340
Like you can't get over-- so
couple things that are cliche

779
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,190
for people that are artists like you.

780
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,202
You need to be careful
to become too romantic

781
00:28:09,202 --> 00:28:12,523
about your truth, let me explain.

782
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:15,460
What starts happening after
awhile is you manifest

783
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,890
into realizing how pure it
is and then the only thing

784
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,870
you care about is the
purity of the purity,

785
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,120
become a caricature of yourself.

786
00:28:23,486 --> 00:28:26,610
Your biggest vulnerability
is you becoming a caricature

787
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,952
of your truth because you're
so right and what happens after

788
00:28:30,952 --> 00:28:34,500
like after awhile is you're almost

789
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,460
subconsciously biased
becoming too artistic.

790
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,860
- Wow, we talked about that.

791
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,729
- [Kineet] That was crazy.

792
00:28:41,729 --> 00:28:42,728
(laughing)

793
00:28:42,728 --> 00:28:44,060
- We talked, that's crazy.

794
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,344
- So what you need to do is--

795
00:28:46,344 --> 00:28:48,216
- It's like you're reading my palms.

796
00:28:48,216 --> 00:28:49,808
(laughing)

797
00:28:49,808 --> 00:28:51,922
- I'm serious, it's super
obvious to me right.

798
00:28:51,922 --> 00:28:54,590
That's your only vulnerability.

799
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,568
Otherwise, you'll win.

800
00:28:57,568 --> 00:29:01,468
Which leads me to why micro things matter.

801
00:29:01,468 --> 00:29:05,220
This book matters to me
because it's a micro thing.

802
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,397
Like here's how it works for me.

803
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:09,173
This isn't about the money.

804
00:29:09,173 --> 00:29:12,325
This is about a lot of
people learn from books,

805
00:29:12,325 --> 00:29:14,390
like people could watch every video,

806
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:17,290
listen to every podcast, but
for some fucking reason--

807
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,820
Books, I guess it's all
gathered in one place,

808
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,670
I don't learn from reading
so I don't understand it

809
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,680
but other people really
learn from reading,

810
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,300
taking all the notes right.

811
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,640
Like the amount of people that
can take this book and circle

812
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,180
and highlight and put post-its
and that's how they learn.

813
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,971
And for me, I'm obsessed
with the legacy of changing

814
00:29:34,971 --> 00:29:39,217
the game for people and so I'll
manifest this but is this--?

815
00:29:39,217 --> 00:29:42,120
Does this represent me? Is this my--?

816
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,764
No, this is a micro thing.

817
00:29:43,764 --> 00:29:46,250
And where it can get confusing,

818
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,800
especially at this young of an age,

819
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,890
is everything starts feeling macro

820
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,960
and you don't understand
what macro and micro is.

821
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,050
And all of a sudden, you
never put anything out.

822
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,655
And you become Dr. Dre in all those years,

823
00:29:57,655 --> 00:29:58,510
promising albums coming.

824
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,330
You get too macro-ed out.

825
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,036
That's what happened here in that moment.

826
00:30:03,036 --> 00:30:06,520
But he won and just by Dre
and he's an icon and there's--

827
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,398
because truth always wins.

828
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,970
If you're great, there's
nothing you can do to stop it.

829
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,220
(laughing)

830
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:20,458
But the key is you
start getting into that.

831
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:23,860
But you should put out a project.

832
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,310
And if it doesn't do well,
it's not gonna matter.

833
00:30:28,137 --> 00:30:30,369
(laughing)

834
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:32,770
Like all the equity, you get
into a place where everything

835
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,390
that you've done that's been
so right for the last seven,

836
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:40,301
eight years, you think
that output determines

837
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:43,410
like it has a lot of pressure behind it

838
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:47,820
because you haven't done it,
like it gets overthought.

839
00:30:49,945 --> 00:30:53,410
And it gets too precious and
then the timing's never right.

840
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,600
And it just becomes this thing.

841
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,780
And that's how special people lose.

842
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,110
Why do special people that
deserve to win bigger lose?

843
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,433
It's 'cause of everything I just described

844
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:05,100
for the last six minutes.

845
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,030
You gotta be comfortable
with micro and macro.

846
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:12,003
It's not selling out, it's not
putting it all on the line.

847
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:15,555
It's getting into that habit
of I do a lot of micro things,

848
00:31:15,555 --> 00:31:19,360
like my sneaker, that was a micro thing.

849
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,320
I did a collaboration with
K-Swiss, I thought it was cool,

850
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,013
it was doing good, it
could've been a disaster.

851
00:31:25,013 --> 00:31:28,081
And I think when you come
from the right place,

852
00:31:28,081 --> 00:31:30,010
you can't fuck it up.

853
00:31:31,553 --> 00:31:33,630
You have to think about that.

854
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,790
- That means a lot.

855
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:35,900
- I figured it would.

856
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,326
That's why I wanted to listen
way longer than normal,

857
00:31:39,326 --> 00:31:43,314
because I felt there was a
whole lot in you and like,

858
00:31:43,314 --> 00:31:47,844
I was right, you need
to embrace the micro.

859
00:31:47,844 --> 00:31:50,302
'Cause you're so macro-ed out right,

860
00:31:50,302 --> 00:31:53,090
that micro gets scary.

861
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:00,244
- Wow.

862
00:32:00,244 --> 00:32:02,070
- There's so many things that so many

863
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,000
all-time greats did that were wrong

864
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,851
but nobody remembers what
The Beatles did wrong.

865
00:32:07,851 --> 00:32:09,808
- That's true, very true.

866
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:13,612
- There's a lot of whack fucking
songs out of Jay-Z's now.

867
00:32:13,612 --> 00:32:15,600
(laughing)

868
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,980
- I can't look at the camera.

869
00:32:20,469 --> 00:32:23,830
- What people don't understand
is the wins outweigh

870
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:27,100
the losses and if you're
meant and you've got it

871
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,180
like that, it's like-- with who?

872
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:45,750
It's how it works, right?

873
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,790
When I say Lauryn Hill,

874
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,664
you're not thinking about the
900 things that are wrong,

875
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:52,160
you're thinking about the
fucking greatest album

876
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,756
that maybe ever was made.

877
00:32:53,756 --> 00:32:54,845
- Yes, you're right.

878
00:32:54,845 --> 00:32:58,340
- That's what you have
to figure out, got it?

879
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,860
- Yes, I appreciate you so much.

880
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,720
- And you know where it comes from?

881
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,970
And you'll love this,
it comes from humility.

882
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,670
I think what makes you
special is you have it.

883
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,550
I don't think-- I think it might--

884
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,606
I don't know, I'm going
on some good intuition.

885
00:33:11,606 --> 00:33:15,160
I think you need to harness
it because when you harness

886
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,257
your humility, it is your
strength, but when you harness it,

887
00:33:18,257 --> 00:33:21,355
it makes you realize
that the reason I'm right

888
00:33:21,355 --> 00:33:25,040
is 'cause nobody gives
a fuck enough about you.

889
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,310
- That's crazy. This is crazy.

890
00:33:35,523 --> 00:33:38,030
You're giving me chills, yeah it's crazy.

891
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,332
Wow, I got my pony for everything.

892
00:33:40,332 --> 00:33:41,856
(laughing)

893
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:42,689
- It's right.

894
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:45,610
It's what it feels
like, it makes so much--

895
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,740
I can just see it, it's
as clear as day for me

896
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,990
what's going on with you.

897
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:53,734
Doesn't mean you need to sign,

898
00:33:53,734 --> 00:33:57,520
but you should put out,
you know I always say

899
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,192
put out more stuff,
everybody's got their reasons

900
00:34:01,192 --> 00:34:02,850
and versions but it's
always the right answer.

901
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:09,910
You just have too much in
you to like no put it out and

902
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,080
you're just putting too much
romance around the narrative

903
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,500
and you've been so good at
being the architect behind it,

904
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,249
but your pride sits within it.

905
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,210
- We need to hear this, like
we really needed to hear this.

906
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,876
(overlapped chattering)

907
00:34:29,876 --> 00:34:31,990
Like you said everything.

908
00:34:33,074 --> 00:34:35,369
This was crazy.

909
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,239
- It makes sense to me.

910
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,613
- Wow, I'm afraid of him, like I am.

911
00:34:39,614 --> 00:34:41,215
- You're welcome.

912
00:34:41,215 --> 00:34:42,589
- Thank you.

913
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:44,510
- Yeah, this is what I'm
good at, like it's really--

914
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,010
and by the way, this is what you'll have,

915
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:50,350
because this is the experiences
version of the talent I had.

916
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,070
I was sitting right there.

917
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:55,130
At 22, I was working at
my dad's liquor store,

918
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,750
getting shit on my all
my friends, parents,

919
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,170
and the whole world, like you
fucking suck so much that your

920
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,420
job outta college is you
working your dad's liquor store.

921
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,244
And I was like, "Keep talking."

922
00:35:05,244 --> 00:35:06,270
You understand?

923
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,790
It was all here, I understood right.

924
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,723
I was patient, I did what I had to do.

925
00:35:10,723 --> 00:35:14,611
But what I didn't have was 20
fucking years of experience.

926
00:35:14,611 --> 00:35:17,941
You'll be talking just
like this in 20 years.

927
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:22,484
Experience matters, I now
understand 'cause I've tasted it,

928
00:35:22,484 --> 00:35:25,578
'cause I had to go through
my own kind feeling

929
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:27,210
to be able to get it.

930
00:35:29,973 --> 00:35:32,156
You know?

931
00:35:32,156 --> 00:35:33,737
- This means so much.

932
00:35:33,737 --> 00:35:34,570
I really appreciate it.

933
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,880
- Especially 'cause you
can help so many people.

934
00:35:37,894 --> 00:35:39,800
Your music is so powerful, right.

935
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,210
Like all those stories and thoughts,

936
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,250
they need to see the world.

937
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,640
You're being selfish.

938
00:35:48,557 --> 00:35:51,400
- You're right, you're right.
- I know.

939
00:35:52,475 --> 00:35:54,300
- He's so right. Wow.

940
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,370
- So that's it.

941
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,100
You know, take this and
listen, let's be friends.

942
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,434
I really wanna be friends.

943
00:35:58,434 --> 00:35:59,959
- I do too.
- Okay, good.

944
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:01,642
(laughing)

945
00:36:01,642 --> 00:36:03,480
- I was gonna ask you,
can we buy a book today?

946
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,074
- You can get a book.

947
00:36:05,074 --> 00:36:06,411
- No, I wanna buy it.

948
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:07,575
We can't buy a book?

949
00:36:07,575 --> 00:36:08,814
- You can't buy it, but
I'm gonna give it you.

950
00:36:08,814 --> 00:36:10,927
Alright, get me a pen, I'm counting.

951
00:36:10,927 --> 00:36:12,698
- Mind if I take a few photos?

952
00:36:12,698 --> 00:36:13,531
- That'd be amazing.

953
00:36:13,531 --> 00:36:16,290
- No, the thing is like
the team wants a book.

954
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,690
Like we want to buy our books.

955
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:18,993
- You want multiple?

956
00:36:18,993 --> 00:36:20,820
- [Kineet] Yeah, we wanna buy it though.

957
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,080
- I can't have you buy it.

958
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,955
That's just not gonna happen.

959
00:36:23,955 --> 00:36:25,652
(laughing)

960
00:36:25,652 --> 00:36:28,402
(pen scribbling)

961
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,038
- Yeah, go get me some.
- Thank you so much.

962
00:36:35,038 --> 00:36:36,000
- You're welcome.

963
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,833
Let's take a quick photo.

964
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:37,666
I gotta take a call.

965
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:39,256
I'll give you guys books.

966
00:36:39,256 --> 00:36:40,440
You got it?
- Yup.

967
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:46,392
(camera clicking)

968
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,389
- For me, without the book
'cause I want it just me and you.

969
00:36:52,389 --> 00:36:53,780
Get in here.

970
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,355
- [Nick] Alright, ready?

971
00:36:55,355 --> 00:36:58,920
(camera clicking)

972
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,061
- Give me a hug.

973
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:01,731
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

974
00:37:01,731 --> 00:37:03,570
- You're welcome, you're welcome.

975
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,920
She's special, she really is man.

976
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,210
She's like gonna win.

977
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:10,810
Let me help, like you're
gonna win like for real.

978
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,590
Honestly, you know what's running
through my mind right now?

979
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,670
Straight up?

980
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,200
I'm like, "I am so happy
I have that on film."

981
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,780
'Cause one day you're gonna be
the biggest star in the world

982
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,470
and I'm just gonna keep
putting out the clip

983
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,123
where you're like, "Wow he's the best."

984
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:24,900
Like just imagine on a very serious cake,

985
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,930
imagine you like film of
like you acting that way

986
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,290
but you were a 20-year-old Beyonce,

987
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,826
like that's what I think is gonna happen.

988
00:37:32,826 --> 00:37:34,776
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

989
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:38,730
That was incredible.

990
00:37:40,571 --> 00:37:44,101
She was incred-- I really
liked that meeting.

991
00:37:44,101 --> 00:00:00,000
(ringing)
