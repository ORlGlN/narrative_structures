1
00:00:00,197 --> 00:00:01,030
- What's up, vlog?

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,655
As you guys know, if you're
really paying attention.

3
00:00:03,655 --> 00:00:05,831
I haven't been investing a whole
bunch in the last 18 months

4
00:00:05,831 --> 00:00:09,513
because I think consumer web
app, mobile app, you know,

5
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:11,322
next Twitter this, or the Uber that,

6
00:00:11,322 --> 00:00:13,547
or the Air BnB of this,
or the Uber of that,

7
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,978
like, just boring, lot
of fake entrepreneurship.

8
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:17,564
But one place where I
see huge white space,

9
00:00:17,564 --> 00:00:18,782
as you guys know, is voice,
and so I took this trip

10
00:00:18,782 --> 00:00:22,449
to Seattle, to the
Techstars voice, kind of,

11
00:00:23,304 --> 00:00:26,521
Amazon Alexa incubator, people
that are building on top of

12
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:29,854
the Alexa scale platform, and obviously,

13
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:32,873
they'll be building on top
of Google Home and Apple,

14
00:00:32,873 --> 00:00:35,793
Home Pod as well, that to
me, is the white space.

15
00:00:35,793 --> 00:00:37,296
And so, this talk is intriguing,
a little different look,

16
00:00:37,296 --> 00:00:39,561
gives you a little bit
of my different mindset,

17
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:41,121
of, kind of, how I'm thinking
about entrepreneurship

18
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:45,572
and the white space of
complete platform shifts,

19
00:00:45,572 --> 00:00:47,177
not the white space of the nuances

20
00:00:47,177 --> 00:00:49,561
within a platform like social media.

21
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:51,006
So, really excited about it,

22
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:53,729
hope you enjoy it, and I'll see you soon.

23
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:56,229
(funky music)

24
00:01:00,955 --> 00:01:02,523
- Obviously, Gary was at the forefront

25
00:01:02,523 --> 00:01:06,023
of social, you watched all of that happen,

26
00:01:06,952 --> 00:01:08,068
now, you're seeing similarities

27
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,038
in what's happening with voice,

28
00:01:09,038 --> 00:01:10,790
we'd love to kick it off
about why you're here,

29
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,623
why you're excited,

30
00:01:11,623 --> 00:01:12,545
what you're seeing
- Can I sit?

31
00:01:12,545 --> 00:01:13,543
Can I sit?
- I would rather,

32
00:01:13,543 --> 00:01:14,539
yeah, go sit there, I would rather

33
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:17,477
you guys be asking
questions rather than me,

34
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:22,258
if you don't, I will take up
all the time with my questions.

35
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:23,286
So, let's kick it off.

36
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:25,597
- Real pleasure to be
here, thanks for having me.

37
00:01:25,597 --> 00:01:27,547
And even long before social,

38
00:01:27,547 --> 00:01:31,681
I launched an e-commerce
wine business in 1996, right,

39
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:33,323
so, basically, the story
of my life has been,

40
00:01:33,323 --> 00:01:36,625
pretty much, more
intuitive of what I think

41
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:39,045
people are gonna do,
not super data'ed out,

42
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:41,947
not super scientific
about it, just, kind of,

43
00:01:41,947 --> 00:01:44,962
on my gut intuition,
actually taking it way back,

44
00:01:44,962 --> 00:01:47,679
as a kid, I made a lot of
money selling baseball cards,

45
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:50,884
and the first time I really
remember this happening

46
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:52,759
was, I was at a baseball card show,

47
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,440
a normal thing that I would do

48
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,166
in my junior year of high school,

49
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:59,114
and for some reason, I just didn't like

50
00:01:59,114 --> 00:02:01,425
the way the room felt, like, just,

51
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:03,222
it wasn't that I was calculating

52
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:04,398
how many people were showing up

53
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:06,000
or how much money people were spending,

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,799
I just didn't like the way it felt,

55
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,959
and literally, within a month,

56
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,031
I sold my entire collection
and poured all that money

57
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:14,149
into comic books and
toys, and that was right.

58
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:16,093
And, basically, intuition
in the wine business

59
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:18,840
that I grew up with,
you know, around Oregon,

60
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,605
and, you know, South American
and South African wines,

61
00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:24,451
and so, that's always been my place,

62
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:29,356
and those spidey senses are
completely off the charts

63
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:32,138
in this space, and to
be very honest with you,

64
00:02:32,138 --> 00:02:35,123
I'm not Nostrodamus, these spidey senses

65
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:37,253
are off to the races for you.

66
00:02:37,253 --> 00:02:39,349
There's people that have
been doing this much longer.

67
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:43,516
It just, to me, I like to
get into a very specific time

68
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,409
in the lineage of a space.

69
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:51,818
I'm never smart enough
or scientific enough

70
00:02:51,818 --> 00:02:54,895
to get in super early, thank you so much,

71
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:59,557
as entrepreneurs, as you guys
are, I think there's times

72
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:02,115
to get in super too early, for example,

73
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,147
in parallel, in our world,
there's a lot of people

74
00:03:05,147 --> 00:03:07,886
tackling consumer VR, and think, like,

75
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:09,663
that's going to be super remarkable,

76
00:03:09,663 --> 00:03:13,878
and for me, that's still
too early to be at scale,

77
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:16,455
and I think a lot of people
are gonna be not practical,

78
00:03:16,455 --> 00:03:17,868
and waste a lot of money and time,

79
00:03:17,868 --> 00:03:19,416
and I just think it's further away

80
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,589
before everybody's doing it.

81
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:24,891
And so, the things that
I'm seeing in this space,

82
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:27,816
is it feels that, I just
can't wrap my head around

83
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:32,173
a world, in America for sure,
and other parts of the world,

84
00:03:32,173 --> 00:03:36,325
where, in 48 months, not
everybody's doing this.

85
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:37,957
And so, that's when it gets good.

86
00:03:37,957 --> 00:03:39,501
That's when it gets practical.

87
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:40,973
And I'm also intrigued because I think

88
00:03:40,973 --> 00:03:42,485
I've, personally, learned, and I'm sure

89
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:44,871
you as entrepreneurs and
innovators have learned,

90
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:47,498
we've learned a lot about
building on top of systems,

91
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:49,777
whether the Apple ecosystem,
things of that nature,

92
00:03:49,777 --> 00:03:52,545
so it's going to be interesting
how this all transpires.

93
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:55,179
But for me, it's just, it's time,

94
00:03:55,179 --> 00:03:56,439
it's time for me to get educated,

95
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,072
it's time for me to make bets, it's time

96
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:02,374
for me to make things,
it's time for me to come

97
00:04:02,374 --> 00:04:06,275
and spend, in a world where
I'm hacking every five minutes,

98
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:08,069
you know, I wanted to schlep here,

99
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:10,436
and I'm thankful for the opportunity

100
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:12,120
to hang with you guys and gals, and so,

101
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,287
it just, in the Gary, in one
human being's personal radar,

102
00:04:17,403 --> 00:04:19,156
it's now just a matter of time,

103
00:04:19,156 --> 00:04:21,420
and if, the biggest thing in this room,

104
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:23,899
especially if I get the
luxury to spend some time

105
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:25,972
with you guys individually, to me,

106
00:04:25,972 --> 00:04:28,851
it's just about staying
alive until it gets good.

107
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,203
The biggest thing that, I think,

108
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,011
you will get caught with,
and I've seen over and over,

109
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:35,829
is, are you running it practically?

110
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:37,355
Are you at the mercy of VC,

111
00:04:37,355 --> 00:04:39,442
or this incubator, or anything else?

112
00:04:39,442 --> 00:04:43,207
Are you at the mercy of anything
over the next 36 months?

113
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:45,945
Are you capable of
understanding what it takes

114
00:04:45,945 --> 00:04:48,406
to do over the next 36 months?

115
00:04:48,406 --> 00:04:50,138
Because you're right.

116
00:04:50,138 --> 00:04:54,340
Like, your brain is
100%, you're 100% right.

117
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,577
Now there's just two variables.

118
00:04:55,577 --> 00:04:58,698
Can you be there when it happens,
and is there somebody else

119
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,220
that can do the same
thing better than you?

120
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,240
That's it.

121
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,472
And so, I think that's
great, because I don't think

122
00:05:03,472 --> 00:05:05,620
there's a lot of spaces in
the world that look like that.

123
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,601
So I think you've won the
better part of the bet,

124
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:10,303
which is the global strategy
of what you're gonna do

125
00:05:10,303 --> 00:05:11,627
with your time in your life.

126
00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:13,228
Now it's about those two variables.

127
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:15,261
That's what I would be
spending all my time on,

128
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:17,270
that's what I do spend all my time on.

129
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,354
- [Facilitator] Are there
any specific moments

130
00:05:19,354 --> 00:05:23,726
that you either had with
a voice-assisted device

131
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:25,001
or you watched someone else have,

132
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:26,467
that kind of clicked in your head

133
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:30,106
in terms of, whoa, this
is gonna become something.

134
00:05:30,106 --> 00:05:31,638
- No.

135
00:05:31,638 --> 00:05:33,457
Nope, nothing like that.

136
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:36,732
You know, I kind of was
watching and knowing

137
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:39,938
and seeing, and got a device,

138
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:41,599
and saw other people had a device,

139
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:44,599
you know, there was no magic moment.

140
00:05:46,983 --> 00:05:48,971
To me, I only believe that

141
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:51,809
there are only a couple of
things that matter to people.

142
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,299
Health and money and
religion, and I think time

143
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:55,632
is way up there.

144
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,316
And anybody who can't
put the pieces together

145
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:00,686
to understand why voice and time

146
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:03,036
are a really interesting variable,

147
00:06:03,036 --> 00:06:04,981
are just missing this whole point.

148
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:07,405
So it's inconceivable, to me, anything,

149
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:10,908
Uber, I passed on Uber
twice in the angel round.

150
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:14,047
You know, if you go, if
you open my first book,

151
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:16,184
the only person I thank besides my family

152
00:06:16,184 --> 00:06:18,645
is Travis, we were really
good friends long before Uber.

153
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,373
You know, I didn't invest in it,

154
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:23,967
and, that, I did have a moment.

155
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,236
When he came to New York
to ask for some help

156
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:29,519
to think about how to launch
New York as a second market,

157
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,602
my brother AJ and I were meeting with him,

158
00:06:31,602 --> 00:06:33,668
and he's like, "Hey,
we've got, like, a test

159
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:36,961
alpha car in the market, can you try it?"

160
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:39,229
And AJ ordered the Uber while we were,

161
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:42,331
there was something, I
don't know why that hit me,

162
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:43,997
but there was something
that didn't happen to me

163
00:06:43,997 --> 00:06:45,957
in San Francisco, that
AJ being in a high rise

164
00:06:45,957 --> 00:06:47,949
in New York, hitting a
button, and it, like,

165
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,802
saving that time, made me realize that day

166
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:56,157
that Uber was selling time,
not selling transportation.

167
00:06:56,157 --> 00:07:00,324
So, that's when I started
getting really crazy about time.

168
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:03,442
I'd always been about lack of friction

169
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:05,899
and things of that nature, but because

170
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:08,203
all the way back in 2010-11,

171
00:07:08,203 --> 00:07:10,903
time got crazy important to me,

172
00:07:10,903 --> 00:07:14,790
when the voice thing started
becoming more on my radar,

173
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,739
I mean, it's just such an incredible play,

174
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,292
and so, there was no one thing,

175
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:24,851
but it was just the complete passion

176
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:27,174
of, how do we save people time?

177
00:07:27,174 --> 00:07:30,645
People always pay for
time, time will always win.

178
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:32,097
- [Facilitator] Yeah, and
I think that's one thing

179
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:33,171
that all the companies in here

180
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:35,022
have been looking for, right, is that,

181
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:37,118
what is that magic moment
with these platforms

182
00:07:37,118 --> 00:07:39,202
that gets people to actually, you know,

183
00:07:39,202 --> 00:07:41,051
have those, that click.

184
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:43,351
That, like, "This is
the new way to do this."

185
00:07:43,351 --> 00:07:45,384
- So I would go about it a
little bit different way,

186
00:07:45,384 --> 00:07:48,075
you know, if that's a
conversation you're having,

187
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:50,759
I think the people in
here that will succeed

188
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,041
are the ones who spend no time on that.

189
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,595
I think you just need to basically, like,

190
00:07:55,595 --> 00:08:00,464
that sounds like debating
things that mean nothing to me.

191
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:02,932
Meaning, do you believe that
every single fucking person

192
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:06,100
is gonna have a device in
their home in 48 months?

193
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,956
And I think that answer is yes.

194
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:12,114
And so, then, who gives
a shit what moment,

195
00:08:12,114 --> 00:08:15,220
what commercial, what app, does that?

196
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,982
To me, it's cool, I've
assumed that to be true,

197
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:23,215
how do I create what I want
to create in that truth,

198
00:08:23,215 --> 00:08:26,977
and how do I make sure that I'm there?

199
00:08:26,977 --> 00:08:27,810
- [Facilitator] And as you, kind of,

200
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,286
look at the parallels of that happening,

201
00:08:29,286 --> 00:08:33,043
and a lot of times, people
try and drop to, like,

202
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:34,198
when the iPhone first
came out, and suddenly,

203
00:08:34,198 --> 00:08:37,344
people have these devices,
you know, in their pockets,

204
00:08:37,345 --> 00:08:39,306
and the first things that happen there

205
00:08:39,306 --> 00:08:40,903
tend to be games, entertainment,

206
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:43,527
as you think about these
cases in the future

207
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:45,953
that you get excited
about, what are those?

208
00:08:45,953 --> 00:08:47,542
- That's a good question.

209
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:50,042
I mean, I'm very, very excited

210
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,429
on a couple of things
that are personal, I just,

211
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:56,339
how many people here know

212
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,192
somebody that's really
into wine, raise your hand.

213
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:00,535
Perfect.

214
00:09:00,535 --> 00:09:03,868
So, when somebody gets just a
little bit of wine knowledge,

215
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:05,725
they become a straight douchebag.

216
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:07,332
(audience laughs)

217
00:09:07,332 --> 00:09:09,312
So, I've been on a decade journey

218
00:09:09,312 --> 00:09:10,793
to, like, demystify wine.

219
00:09:10,793 --> 00:09:13,317
I'm really excited about, you know,

220
00:09:13,317 --> 00:09:16,383
the idea of people
being able to be at home

221
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:18,449
and tasting wine along with me,

222
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:19,866
and being educated and learning,

223
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:21,211
I think there's a lot
of that kind of stuff,

224
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:23,460
I love the idea of people learning

225
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,654
how to fix their car motor, because

226
00:09:25,654 --> 00:09:28,295
there's an expert right next to them.

227
00:09:28,295 --> 00:09:30,559
So, the expert space excites me a lot.

228
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,496
Like, when you really play it out,

229
00:09:32,496 --> 00:09:34,942
the chess moves, when it
gets that sophisticated,

230
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,751
we're gonna be able to
have that communication,

231
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:38,191
I think that's super fascinating,

232
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:40,049
I think you guys are
thinking about that right,

233
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:41,574
if that's the conversation, I think,

234
00:09:41,574 --> 00:09:43,449
there's complete pattern recognition

235
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,503
into what things play first,

236
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:47,291
and I do think what you're
talking about is called,

237
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,544
in my mind, escapism, right,

238
00:09:49,544 --> 00:09:51,373
something that, like,
takes me away from the fact

239
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:52,522
that the world is difficult,

240
00:09:52,522 --> 00:09:54,778
or my personal world is difficult,

241
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:56,464
and that's entertainment and gaming,

242
00:09:56,464 --> 00:09:58,745
things that just take
me out of my real life,

243
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:02,675
those are always very
fruitful first places to play,

244
00:10:02,675 --> 00:10:04,579
because, A, you have a creative set

245
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:06,411
of people who are usually playing,

246
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:08,846
so yeah, I can see that.

247
00:10:08,846 --> 00:10:11,603
But I do think the expert
space is intriguing.

248
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:14,121
The person that makes the first app

249
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:17,702
that is really, you know, advanced,

250
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:20,077
and can really help somebody either

251
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,462
really learn something, cooking, you know,

252
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:25,239
that's why I love IP,
like, I'd love to be owning

253
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:27,520
Julia Child's IP right now, right?

254
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,308
You could do something really remarkable

255
00:10:29,308 --> 00:10:32,396
and I'm sure her family
never thought, years ago,

256
00:10:32,396 --> 00:10:34,734
that it'd be deployed against
a voice infrastructure

257
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:38,097
and she'd be helping the world
learn how to make souffle.

258
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:40,042
- [Facilitator] So, last one from me,

259
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:41,654
so get your questions ready,

260
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:45,376
there is no one from Amazon
in the room currently,

261
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:48,081
but when you look at the
different platforms of Amazon,

262
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,020
Google...
- Yep.

263
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,534
- [Facilitator] Who do you
think has the advantage here,

264
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:53,742
why, have you thought about that?

265
00:10:53,742 --> 00:10:54,636
- Yeah, so this is the great part

266
00:10:54,636 --> 00:10:56,422
about filming everything you fucking do,

267
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:00,589
I, I've only been really
aggressively booed onstage,

268
00:11:01,908 --> 00:11:05,822
and I curse, and I'm crass,
and I'm a lot of things

269
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:08,184
that people don't like, at times, onstage,

270
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:11,370
but the only time I was
really aggressively booed

271
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,907
was at South by Southwest when I said

272
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:16,369
that Jeff Bezos was
better than Steve Jobs,

273
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:19,119
back in, like, 2010-11, like bad.

274
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,621
Yeah, I think, I'm a very
big, big, big, big Amazon fan.

275
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:27,608
I just think, you know,
only the government

276
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:28,908
can really stop him.

277
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:30,804
(audience laughs)

278
00:11:30,804 --> 00:11:33,919
So, I think they're gonna really play,

279
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:36,655
I'm less confident that Google and Apple

280
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,837
are gonna be great at it, I really am.

281
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:40,473
And then, it'd be cool, you know,

282
00:11:40,473 --> 00:11:44,392
for me, it'd be really cool if there was

283
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:47,725
somebody who emerged that doesn't exist.

284
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,991
Or, we, or, you know what'd
be really cool for me,

285
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:54,707
I like that Nintendo started
as a playing card company.

286
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:56,595
Wouldn't it be neat if one
of these big conglomerate,

287
00:11:56,595 --> 00:11:58,276
big companies, finally realized

288
00:11:58,276 --> 00:12:00,084
that they should be putting
themselves out of business

289
00:12:00,084 --> 00:12:02,034
instead of letting somebody else do it,

290
00:12:02,034 --> 00:12:03,399
and took all those dollars they had

291
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,697
and bet it on where the world's going?

292
00:12:05,697 --> 00:12:09,616
So, like, why couldn't BMW be a player?

293
00:12:09,616 --> 00:12:10,449
They could.

294
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:12,053
THey're just not built to do that,

295
00:12:12,053 --> 00:12:15,477
but that would be rad,
if somebody got smart.

296
00:12:15,477 --> 00:12:17,406
- [Facilitator] Turning it over.

297
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:19,656
Who wants to dive in first?

298
00:12:21,511 --> 00:12:22,344
- Yes, sir.

299
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:23,177
What's your name?

300
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:24,010
- [Brian] Brian (mumbles).

301
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,927
- Brian, real pleasure.

302
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,426
And by the way, Brian, I apologize,

303
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:30,099
but for the whole group, also, like,

304
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:32,250
I've done a lot of investing, like,

305
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,057
if you want to go on the business side,

306
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:35,509
not just on the creative
side of what you're doing,

307
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:36,703
feel free to raise your hand.

308
00:12:36,703 --> 00:12:37,657
Go ahead, Brian.

309
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:40,373
- [Brian] So, topic is
surviving that 36 months.

310
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:41,206
- Yeah.

311
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:43,433
- And um...
- You like that thesis?

312
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:44,385
- [Brian] What's that?

313
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:47,490
- Is that a good thought,
like, do you see that?

314
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,086
- [Brian] Well, as a topic,
and one of the things

315
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:50,428
we've been doing here in the cohort

316
00:12:50,428 --> 00:12:53,577
is really sharpening
our measurement skills.

317
00:12:53,577 --> 00:12:54,867
- Okay.
- Right now,

318
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:56,592
like over a five day period, you know,

319
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:57,892
what are those, kind of, three categories

320
00:12:57,892 --> 00:12:59,527
of things that you're
gonna measure yourself,

321
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:01,878
week over week, you know, leading towards

322
00:13:01,878 --> 00:13:03,883
the demo day coming up.

323
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:04,716
- Yes.

324
00:13:04,716 --> 00:13:07,040
- And we pushed out a little further,

325
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,497
and surviving to those 36 months...

326
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,330
- It gets harder.

327
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,528
- It gets harder, right?

328
00:13:11,528 --> 00:13:13,942
- There's only a couple
things I think I understand,

329
00:13:13,942 --> 00:13:14,965
and this is one of them.

330
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:19,667
I am stunned by the fact
that most people build

331
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:23,249
financial arbitrage
machines, not companies.

332
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:24,931
Just spending all their fucking time

333
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:26,186
thinking about how to do things

334
00:13:26,186 --> 00:13:28,732
to make the next fundraising event happen

335
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:30,387
so they can stay alive.

336
00:13:30,387 --> 00:13:33,796
I think, I think start-ups
in today's environment,

337
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:38,318
10 years of good times since
the bad era of the economy,

338
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,890
are way too fucking fancy.

339
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,024
Like, why can't you
have a service business?

340
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,729
Like, why couldn't you hire two people

341
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:48,390
instead of two less
developers, which will take you

342
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,094
nine months longer to
achieve your tech goals,

343
00:13:51,094 --> 00:13:54,241
but you could hire two people
who could do client work

344
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:55,696
or consulting for companies

345
00:13:55,696 --> 00:13:57,200
so you have cash coming in.

346
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,370
There's a binary decision in
advanced technology companies

347
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,650
that are start-ups
that, the way it's done,

348
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,915
is you raise capital, you burn through it,

349
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:06,917
you raise capital, you burn through it,

350
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:07,877
and you have your event, right,

351
00:14:07,877 --> 00:14:10,771
you either become a profitable
company or you sell.

352
00:14:10,771 --> 00:14:13,873
The fact that there's
no practical parallel

353
00:14:13,873 --> 00:14:15,428
of, "Well, what else could we be doing,"

354
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:17,861
like, what if there was no venture money?

355
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:20,910
Like, what do you think happens
when the markets collapse?

356
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,680
These companies figure it out.

357
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,204
When you're as lucky,
you guys aren't mobile

358
00:14:25,204 --> 00:14:28,357
or social companies, you're
playing in a new field.

359
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:30,063
Nobody knows anything about it.

360
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:31,839
Which means that there's enormous appetite

361
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,351
for the leaders to pay
for a knowledge transfer.

362
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:39,825
And so, my biggest thing is, first of all,

363
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:43,189
forget about the people you
surround yourself, you guys.

364
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:44,765
Everything's your fault.

365
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:45,848
You're the founders.

366
00:14:45,848 --> 00:14:46,690
You need to be in charge

367
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,219
of having a real, structured strategy

368
00:14:50,219 --> 00:14:53,351
to how to stay alive,
and everybody's rushing

369
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:56,132
to make the product, or to do this thing,

370
00:14:56,132 --> 00:14:58,356
and, to me, it's like,
give up six months of that,

371
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,722
to do something that's making you

372
00:14:59,722 --> 00:15:01,840
practical dollars along the way.

373
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,866
It's just something nobody
ever wants to talk about,

374
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:06,465
because everyone's so
fucking fancy, Brian.

375
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:07,419
You know?

376
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:08,661
Everyone's fancy.

377
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:10,182
Like, and I just think that's stupid.

378
00:15:10,182 --> 00:15:12,179
I also think it's compoundly stupid

379
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:15,053
after nine years of
good economy, you know,

380
00:15:15,053 --> 00:15:18,516
I mean, the only thing that I think

381
00:15:18,516 --> 00:15:22,181
makes me not think that
the markets would collapse

382
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:24,073
in the next three years during this era,

383
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:25,999
is that, I think, we have a
president who would do anything

384
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:30,511
to manipulate the economy
not to fall during his time.

385
00:15:30,511 --> 00:15:34,331
Other than that, I mean, this
is a long run of prosperity.

386
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:38,550
And, nobody's running businesses
like they're businesses

387
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,360
because there's artificial
dollars in the system.

388
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,193
There's incubators.

389
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:43,933
There's all this shit.

390
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:47,947
So, I would think about
how to not waste money,

391
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,720
and how to make money along the way,

392
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,424
while achieving your business goals.

393
00:15:53,424 --> 00:15:55,206
And I know that that's
just not the kind of talk

394
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:57,623
that's going on in our world.

395
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:02,373
- [Audience Member] That's awesome.

396
00:16:03,737 --> 00:16:05,469
- Yes, sir, what's your name?

397
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:06,322
- [Alex] Alex.

398
00:16:06,322 --> 00:16:07,155
- Alex.

399
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:07,988
- [Alex] From (mumbles).

400
00:16:07,988 --> 00:16:11,438
Do you see, so, speakers, smart speakers,

401
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:14,249
going into homes real quick, the voices

402
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:17,372
across a bunch of other
platforms, you know,

403
00:16:17,372 --> 00:16:18,670
you could get it for your TV.
- Yes.

404
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,618
I agree.

405
00:16:19,618 --> 00:16:23,118
- Do you have a view on whether the, like,

406
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:26,680
propagation of smart
speakers is gonna peter out,

407
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,965
and where it's gonna (mumbles),

408
00:16:27,965 --> 00:16:28,798
sweep into something else?

409
00:16:28,798 --> 00:16:30,103
Like, where do you see voice,

410
00:16:30,103 --> 00:16:31,415
fitting in.
- Yeah.

411
00:16:31,415 --> 00:16:33,255
With the speakers, from
a speaker standpoint.

412
00:16:33,255 --> 00:16:34,912
So, for example, do you know who I think

413
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:37,314
should be making the single
biggest bet in this space?

414
00:16:37,314 --> 00:16:40,564
The Toll Brothers construction company.

415
00:16:41,454 --> 00:16:43,483
I mean, every home built going forward

416
00:16:43,483 --> 00:16:47,270
should have an upcharge,
huge profit margin for them,

417
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,764
where they're like, "You
don't need those speakers,

418
00:16:48,764 --> 00:16:49,931
it's just in!"

419
00:16:51,293 --> 00:16:52,126
Right?

420
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:53,573
Security systems, right?

421
00:16:53,573 --> 00:16:56,410
The people that secure your
homes, things of that nature.

422
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,705
So, yeah, I'm not, I'm sure there's,

423
00:16:58,705 --> 00:17:00,380
I haven't done the homework on this,

424
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:04,161
I'm sure there's clearly
an intriguing window

425
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:07,000
for the hardware in that form,

426
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,864
but I think that's commoditized,

427
00:17:08,864 --> 00:17:10,837
and there's a lot of things
that can deliver that,

428
00:17:10,837 --> 00:17:13,800
and I do think that that's dangerous,

429
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,956
other than if you have great tech

430
00:17:15,957 --> 00:17:18,719
that can then be put into a wall

431
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:20,356
or a bottled water, or what-have-you,

432
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:23,997
but, like, as a
consumer-facing speaker play,

433
00:17:23,997 --> 00:17:25,521
I think there'll be a window,

434
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:26,904
but over time, that gets commoditized,

435
00:17:26,905 --> 00:17:28,871
so you have to, I don't
love when you have to,

436
00:17:28,871 --> 00:17:31,328
not only all the things
we just talked about,

437
00:17:31,328 --> 00:17:35,750
but then the macro consumer
behavior moment, as well,

438
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,992
that adds another layer of timing

439
00:17:37,992 --> 00:17:40,901
which usually forces
you to be less patient,

440
00:17:40,901 --> 00:17:42,335
which is what I was talking
about, right, Brian?

441
00:17:42,335 --> 00:17:44,483
Like, now you're forcing
it because you know,

442
00:17:44,483 --> 00:17:46,584
"Shit, we've got 24 months before," right?

443
00:17:46,584 --> 00:17:49,742
So, yeah, I would, I'm far more bullish

444
00:17:49,742 --> 00:17:51,994
on the people who have got
the tech or the infrastructure

445
00:17:51,994 --> 00:17:54,634
around what's making it sound great,

446
00:17:54,634 --> 00:17:56,957
more so than the physical
product, you know,

447
00:17:56,957 --> 00:18:00,683
I think that just plays
out, you know, right?

448
00:18:00,683 --> 00:18:02,304
I mean, Amazon's,

449
00:18:02,304 --> 00:18:04,446
Amazon and everybody else should be making

450
00:18:04,446 --> 00:18:07,242
a smart refrigerator that
has speakers built into it

451
00:18:07,242 --> 00:18:10,760
so that, not only is it fully
penetrating your kitchen,

452
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,319
but it's reordering every product for you

453
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:15,682
once you've used up a
percentage of that product

454
00:18:15,682 --> 00:18:18,190
inside the refrigerator.

455
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,219
- [Male Entrepreneur] So, you mentioned

456
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:20,675
at the start of these spaces,

457
00:18:20,675 --> 00:18:22,479
there's a, you know, an opportunity

458
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:24,106
for start-ups like the ones we have here

459
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:25,638
to work with a knowledge transfer

460
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,331
to some of those larger organizations.

461
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:28,164
- Yeah.

462
00:18:28,164 --> 00:18:29,348
- [Male Entrepreneur] But,
there's also a another thing,

463
00:18:29,348 --> 00:18:30,263
which some of these companies are

464
00:18:30,263 --> 00:18:31,274
starting to experience too,

465
00:18:31,274 --> 00:18:32,671
is that these larger companies

466
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:34,642
who don't understand
the space are thinking,

467
00:18:34,642 --> 00:18:36,290
"Are you acquisition targets?"

468
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,477
And, you know, how would you, kind of,

469
00:18:38,477 --> 00:18:40,046
advise me to think about,

470
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:42,095
sticking it out for the long run,

471
00:18:42,095 --> 00:18:44,213
you take a quick win,
what does that look like?

472
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:46,037
- Yeah, I mean, I think the
cool answer to that question

473
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:47,823
is that that's very
specific to you, right,

474
00:18:47,823 --> 00:18:49,647
there's no right answer to that.

475
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:51,701
What I love, as you were
talking, like, "Fuck,

476
00:18:51,701 --> 00:18:53,694
I should have brought up that point too,"

477
00:18:53,694 --> 00:18:55,178
because that doubles up the reason

478
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:58,732
why to be practical and have
a parallel service business

479
00:18:58,732 --> 00:19:00,043
that's bringing you revenue in,

480
00:19:00,043 --> 00:19:01,116
because it's probably the gateway

481
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:03,765
to a more significant
acquisition opportunity

482
00:19:03,765 --> 00:19:05,408
because they get to lease before they buy

483
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:08,013
and understand that you're
smart and you get it.

484
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,234
And we've seen through the history,

485
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:12,709
if you're here to make,
make that financial nut,

486
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:14,962
you know, the amount of ACU hires,

487
00:19:14,962 --> 00:19:17,048
we've seen some ungodly, we saw on social,

488
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:20,994
ungodly exits, where the guy
or the gal was getting bought.

489
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,538
I think that actually doubles up

490
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,114
why I think you should go in,

491
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:26,417
but, like, it's up to you if you,

492
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:28,112
if Coca-Cola, you're
doing a project for them

493
00:19:28,112 --> 00:19:29,853
in parallel while you build your thing,

494
00:19:29,853 --> 00:19:32,506
and they want to offer
you seven million dollars,

495
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:36,146
I mean, that's just, or
70, or seven billion,

496
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:37,758
I mean, I think that's,
I think at seven billion,

497
00:19:37,758 --> 00:19:39,175
a lot more people here would go for it,

498
00:19:39,175 --> 00:19:40,539
(audience laughs)

499
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:42,172
um, I think, I think the
punchline there being,

500
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:44,221
everybody here has their own circumstance.

501
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:48,433
You know, for me, I had, a
long, long, long time ago,

502
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:49,841
far less money than I have now,

503
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:52,041
that was the money I wanted to make.

504
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,719
Then it became about legacy, like,

505
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:58,519
playing the game, and a lot
of different things, right?

506
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:01,608
Not, some people want to amass
dollars their whole life,

507
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:04,579
some people want, don't wanna
have, don't like the idea

508
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,716
of earning out for three years

509
00:20:06,716 --> 00:20:07,976
because they think, I
would be very empathetic

510
00:20:07,976 --> 00:20:09,770
if I became best friends
with everybody here,

511
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,760
and a year from now,
everybody gets an offer,

512
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,187
I could really see that tough decision

513
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:16,200
of like, fuck, this is
life-changing money,

514
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,220
and this is my, you know,
this would be helpful for me,

515
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,984
but I'm locked up for
three years, and fuck,

516
00:20:20,984 --> 00:20:23,435
these next three years in this space?

517
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:25,188
They're so fruitful.

518
00:20:25,188 --> 00:20:28,259
So, I don't think there's
a one-size-fits-all,

519
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:29,540
and some people have student loans

520
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,756
and sick parents, and you
get into a million variables.

521
00:20:32,756 --> 00:20:34,006
They both work.

522
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:36,490
The amount of people that said no,

523
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,740
in the 1.0, Web 2.0, and social bubble,

524
00:20:40,877 --> 00:20:42,705
and ended up with dickshit,

525
00:20:42,705 --> 00:20:44,344
is a lot.

526
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:46,904
The amount of people that said yes,

527
00:20:46,904 --> 00:20:49,133
Instagram and others,

528
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:51,426
could have gotten a lot more.

529
00:20:51,426 --> 00:20:52,962
Bebo's super happy they sold for

530
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:54,689
850 million dollars to AOL.

531
00:20:54,689 --> 00:20:55,598
(audience laughs)

532
00:20:55,598 --> 00:20:56,631
You know?

533
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:59,412
You know, so, you know, I, I think

534
00:20:59,412 --> 00:21:00,830
there's a lot of ways that goes.

535
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,967
I think that's where you
go, that's where you,

536
00:21:02,967 --> 00:21:05,984
I get really worried that mentorship is,

537
00:21:05,984 --> 00:21:07,900
mentorship is so important, but it can be

538
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,381
substantially overrated, because mentors

539
00:21:09,381 --> 00:21:13,653
tend to love to give the
advice that they lived through,

540
00:21:13,653 --> 00:21:16,839
or they don't contextualize
all these human variables

541
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:19,793
that I just brought up, so, the
answer would be all of them.

542
00:21:19,793 --> 00:21:22,167
However, I'm a big fan of options.

543
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:26,475
So, I sure love the idea of
you making money along the way,

544
00:21:26,475 --> 00:21:28,815
that also led to an MNA opportunity,

545
00:21:28,815 --> 00:21:32,565
it's a lot more fun to
have options than not.

546
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:36,464
- [Male Entrepreneur]
I'll take this one, then.

547
00:21:36,464 --> 00:21:37,297
- Okay.

548
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,845
- [Male Entrepreneur]
So, you know, a lot of

549
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:41,559
what you've done over the past, you know,

550
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:44,578
decade or so, social, recognizing
how this was gonna change

551
00:21:44,578 --> 00:21:48,270
customer service, customer
experience, and, you know,

552
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,563
require more authenticity, you know,

553
00:21:50,563 --> 00:21:52,692
we're not necessarily just
talking about it with voice,

554
00:21:52,692 --> 00:21:54,664
I'm just curious how you, kind of,

555
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:57,067
came to a lot of those conclusions

556
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:58,653
and navigated those
and built your business

557
00:21:58,653 --> 00:21:59,981
is really where I'm at.
- You know,

558
00:21:59,981 --> 00:22:01,138
it's funny, I think we all, right,

559
00:22:01,138 --> 00:22:03,640
like, your experiences lead to everything.

560
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,515
I grew up in a retail liquor store.

561
00:22:05,515 --> 00:22:06,669
And I would tell you that voice,

562
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:09,654
I can already make the pieces
all the way backwards to it.

563
00:22:09,654 --> 00:22:11,628
Like, customers don't
like waiting in line.

564
00:22:11,628 --> 00:22:13,913
Nobody likes friction.

565
00:22:13,913 --> 00:22:15,662
And, retail's a real good place,

566
00:22:15,662 --> 00:22:18,164
because it's one thing if
you're a UI/UX data nerd,

567
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:19,358
and you're just looking at it.

568
00:22:19,358 --> 00:22:20,191
It's a whole 'nother thing when

569
00:22:20,191 --> 00:22:22,599
you see the person's venom in their eyes.

570
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:25,716
And it, it got ingrained
in me so early on.

571
00:22:25,716 --> 00:22:28,089
And I'm a depth versus width guy,

572
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:29,484
even though I love width and it's why I do

573
00:22:29,484 --> 00:22:30,988
so much of my schtick,

574
00:22:30,988 --> 00:22:33,575
it's still the depth,
it's always the depth.

575
00:22:33,575 --> 00:22:36,518
So, you know, what I knew about social

576
00:22:36,518 --> 00:22:38,076
was what I knew about email.

577
00:22:38,076 --> 00:22:41,510
I, early, it's just experience,
pattern recognition,

578
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:45,677
early email, I bought a ad on
luxury.com's email newsletter,

579
00:22:47,188 --> 00:22:49,306
they had a million emails newsletter,

580
00:22:49,306 --> 00:22:50,365
and, like, they print their,

581
00:22:50,365 --> 00:22:51,664
you know, this is what's
fun about being old,

582
00:22:51,664 --> 00:22:53,225
this stuff used to be wild.

583
00:22:53,225 --> 00:22:55,080
Like, "You have a million emails?"

584
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,913
It was like (imitates explosion).

585
00:22:55,913 --> 00:22:57,822
You know, like, it was
crazy, I paid a fortune.

586
00:22:57,822 --> 00:22:58,806
Like, we were such a small company,

587
00:22:58,806 --> 00:23:00,231
I think it was like five
or 10 thousand dollars,

588
00:23:00,231 --> 00:23:02,148
which was, like, a lot.

589
00:23:03,128 --> 00:23:07,404
And I called my high school
friends to come into the store,

590
00:23:07,404 --> 00:23:09,032
because they were sending
the email, on their email,

591
00:23:09,032 --> 00:23:11,005
the banner ad, which,
you know, at the point,

592
00:23:11,005 --> 00:23:13,031
at that point, there was some banner stuff

593
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:14,440
I was running on the web in '96

594
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,884
that was getting 14% click-through.

595
00:23:16,884 --> 00:23:19,144
Not .00, you know, like,
it was a different world,

596
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:20,334
as it always will.

597
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:22,830
As will the next three
years of consumer-voice be

598
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,987
compared to 10 years from now.

599
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,748
You guys are all gonna
convert in a way that,

600
00:23:26,748 --> 00:23:28,448
people be, like, one day, like,

601
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,641
"When I had five thousand
Twitter followers,

602
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:33,204
I'd get more retweets than
when I had a million."

603
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:35,128
It's just how it works a lot, right?

604
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:39,241
Anyway, nonetheless, I had
hired four extra people,

605
00:23:39,241 --> 00:23:40,829
brought like seven
friends, I thought we'd be

606
00:23:40,829 --> 00:23:43,536
packing and shipping all day,
we were such a small shop,

607
00:23:43,536 --> 00:23:45,754
and 12 o'clock is when
it was gonna go out,

608
00:23:45,754 --> 00:23:49,928
and it's 12:13, and we
have, like, one order.

609
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,909
And I'm like, like, devastated,

610
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:54,372
trying to figure out, and then, I,

611
00:23:54,372 --> 00:23:56,464
I'll never forget this moment,

612
00:23:56,464 --> 00:23:58,773
I'm like, "Oh, I'm such an idiot!

613
00:23:58,773 --> 00:24:02,490
It's nine o'clock in the
morning on the West Coast!

614
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,371
It's, you know, not twelve!"

615
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:05,454
You know, so.

616
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:08,962
So, I feel better for about 45 minutes

617
00:24:08,962 --> 00:24:11,097
until I get an email from
this guy who's sold me the ad,

618
00:24:11,097 --> 00:24:13,060
and he's like, "How's it going?"

619
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,537
Because they did send it
at 9:00am, twelve my time,

620
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,176
and I'm like, like, you
know when you have those,

621
00:24:17,176 --> 00:24:18,452
you know when blood rushes to your head

622
00:24:18,452 --> 00:24:20,352
and you can almost faint (laughs),

623
00:24:20,352 --> 00:24:23,045
you know, like, I was like,
"Oh, shit, I'm in trouble,"

624
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,767
it was when I realized, huh, open rates,

625
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:27,811
and, you know, I didn't call it that, but,

626
00:24:27,811 --> 00:24:30,563
open rates and click-through
ratios were gonna matter, too,

627
00:24:30,563 --> 00:24:32,344
not just how many you had.

628
00:24:32,344 --> 00:24:37,157
And, basically since then, and
why I did so well in social,

629
00:24:37,157 --> 00:24:38,471
was that was my second rodeo.

630
00:24:38,471 --> 00:24:40,067
I know that's when people got to know me,

631
00:24:40,067 --> 00:24:41,580
but that was my second rodeo.

632
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,668
I learned a lot about
shopping cart optimization

633
00:24:44,668 --> 00:24:48,443
and email, and so, I
think about the depth,

634
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:50,667
not just the width, you know,

635
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:53,320
you're not gonna care
how many people have it,

636
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,456
you're gonna care about how many people

637
00:24:54,456 --> 00:24:56,065
do the right thing with it,

638
00:24:56,065 --> 00:24:58,711
and so, I think a lot about that stuff,

639
00:24:58,711 --> 00:25:00,303
that's how I think about,

640
00:25:00,303 --> 00:25:02,463
why do I care about customer service?

641
00:25:02,463 --> 00:25:04,111
Because it's depth.

642
00:25:04,111 --> 00:25:06,631
Basically, I think about
things very simply.

643
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:09,731
I'm a really great marketer,
that's what I'll be known for,

644
00:25:09,731 --> 00:25:11,617
but if your product blows,

645
00:25:11,617 --> 00:25:14,125
all my great marketing is gonna do

646
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:16,462
is expose it quicker.

647
00:25:16,462 --> 00:25:18,253
The product is the product is the product.

648
00:25:18,253 --> 00:25:19,094
It matters.

649
00:25:19,094 --> 00:25:20,162
You know?

650
00:25:20,162 --> 00:25:21,643
And we do all these things around it

651
00:25:21,643 --> 00:25:23,883
to make it seem like it
doesn't, but it does,

652
00:25:23,883 --> 00:25:25,710
and to me, depth and customer service,

653
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:28,914
you could have ten
thousand followers, and?

654
00:25:28,914 --> 00:25:29,967
Right?
- Yep.

655
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:33,775
- Nobody's paying their mortgage on likes.

656
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:37,009
So you've gotta figure out
what metrics matter, right?

657
00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:39,322
Watch what happens in the podcast space

658
00:25:39,322 --> 00:25:42,957
once all the data comes out now, right?

659
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:44,694
Because, you know, cool, you got in early

660
00:25:44,694 --> 00:25:45,809
and got a lot of subscriptions,

661
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:48,579
and they haven't unsubscribed.

662
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:49,412
Right?

663
00:25:49,412 --> 00:25:51,421
So a lot of people are
about to be exposed.

664
00:25:51,421 --> 00:25:52,254
- [Male Entrepreneur] As you think about

665
00:25:52,254 --> 00:25:53,892
how you built up your career, which,

666
00:25:53,892 --> 00:25:55,438
it sounds like, I mean, it
was pattern recognition,

667
00:25:55,438 --> 00:25:57,905
you saw this work there, and again,

668
00:25:57,905 --> 00:25:59,433
now you've reached a point where

669
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:00,813
you're not just doing
that for your own career,

670
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:03,218
you're investing across
different companies.

671
00:26:03,218 --> 00:26:04,135
- Yep.

672
00:26:04,135 --> 00:26:05,000
- [Male Entrepreneur] If
you could talk a bit about,

673
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,520
you know, how you, how you
kind of evaluate companies,

674
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,531
what you've learned, now,
as an investor (mumbles).

675
00:26:11,531 --> 00:26:12,883
- The first three things
I put my money into

676
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:15,129
were Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr.

677
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:16,731
That's when I was not an investor.

678
00:26:16,731 --> 00:26:19,809
So, I don't like talking
about myself as an investor

679
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:22,351
because I got progressively stupider.

680
00:26:22,351 --> 00:26:24,068
Which is why I gave you
the advice that I gave you.

681
00:26:24,068 --> 00:26:25,391
What I've learned the last six years is,

682
00:26:25,391 --> 00:26:27,969
first of all, it's about
the jockey, not the horse.

683
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:29,640
I'm far more interested about knowing you

684
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,564
and what you're about and how you roll,

685
00:26:31,564 --> 00:26:33,066
because you've gotta pivot and change,

686
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:34,199
and you know this,

687
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:38,291
like, listen, if your
idea's stupid, like, right?

688
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:41,313
If your horse is, like, you know, a horse,

689
00:26:41,313 --> 00:26:43,153
those machines you put the quarter in,

690
00:26:43,153 --> 00:26:44,825
and you've gotta actually run
a race, you're gonna lose.

691
00:26:44,825 --> 00:26:45,806
Like, you know.

692
00:26:45,806 --> 00:26:49,914
But, but it's stunning
how important the CEO is.

693
00:26:49,914 --> 00:26:51,530
How important she and he is.

694
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:55,123
It's stunning for me,
six, seven years later.

695
00:26:55,123 --> 00:26:56,725
Especially in this time,

696
00:26:56,725 --> 00:26:58,461
because you're gonna have to change.

697
00:26:58,461 --> 00:26:59,864
Like, this, you know what's funny

698
00:26:59,864 --> 00:27:01,218
about a new space like this?

699
00:27:01,218 --> 00:27:02,948
Some of the biggest wins are the ones

700
00:27:02,948 --> 00:27:05,785
that go from b to b, to
b to c, and vice versa.

701
00:27:05,785 --> 00:27:08,050
Like, literally just change
your fucking business.

702
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,111
And you, as a CEO, have
to be the kind of person

703
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:12,260
that can react to reality, versus,

704
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:16,229
you're obsessed with the
romance of your vision.

705
00:27:16,229 --> 00:27:18,034
So, I'm spending a lot of time

706
00:27:18,034 --> 00:27:20,909
trying to get to know the person,

707
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:22,691
Phil and I, Phil, Toronto, here,

708
00:27:22,691 --> 00:27:24,370
who's done, who started as my assistant,

709
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,588
does a lot of investing, and helped me

710
00:27:25,588 --> 00:27:28,625
run my last fund, not even invest,

711
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,262
we haven't even invested in the last year,

712
00:27:30,262 --> 00:27:32,706
poor Phil was like, wants
to punch me in the face.

713
00:27:32,706 --> 00:27:34,250
(audience laughs)

714
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,657
You know, like, because we
think things are overinflated,

715
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:37,819
everybody's a fucking entrepreneur,

716
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:39,838
everything's an idea, I mean, guys,

717
00:27:39,838 --> 00:27:41,405
let me just break it down for you,

718
00:27:41,405 --> 00:27:44,522
and I know you're in it,
and I'm in it too, like,

719
00:27:44,522 --> 00:27:46,667
like, if you knew nothing,
it is kind of interesting

720
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,802
that an idea is worth four
to five million dollars.

721
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:52,303
That is what we're talking about.

722
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,864
So it's very interesting times,

723
00:27:53,864 --> 00:27:56,894
and I think, I'm glad, Brian's question,

724
00:27:56,894 --> 00:28:00,128
we started with that, what
I'm looking for especially,

725
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,683
because I want to invest in this space,

726
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:04,853
who can get there in 36 months.

727
00:28:04,853 --> 00:28:06,747
Who can survive.

728
00:28:06,747 --> 00:28:08,221
Who can survive.

729
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:10,761
And that's it, because it's too early

730
00:28:10,761 --> 00:28:13,445
for it to hit too much.

731
00:28:13,445 --> 00:28:15,958
And there's too much that's unknown still,

732
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:18,409
and you're still, I, you know, obviously,

733
00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:20,016
I've got the advantage of sitting with you

734
00:28:20,016 --> 00:28:21,747
for a few seconds, I'm
super pumped to hear

735
00:28:21,747 --> 00:28:23,872
how many people are diverse,
you know, and smart,

736
00:28:23,872 --> 00:28:25,015
and I figured that, I mean, I didn't think

737
00:28:25,015 --> 00:28:27,428
this was gonna be about just
building skills and briefings,

738
00:28:27,428 --> 00:28:30,559
but I'm excited to get, and by the way,

739
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,278
I'm excited to get educated,
myself, about, like,

740
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:34,333
the layers of, like, thinking against,

741
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:37,245
not being at the mercy of the platforms

742
00:28:37,245 --> 00:28:39,295
or how do you go around it.

743
00:28:39,295 --> 00:28:40,834
And then there's just,
like, the things I remember,

744
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:43,150
like, you know, you just thought

745
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,815
Yahoo was gonna be the browser.

746
00:28:45,815 --> 00:28:47,167
You know, when I was, like,

747
00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:49,704
there was no thought that
there was really even a chance

748
00:28:49,704 --> 00:28:51,938
of a Google coming along, you know?

749
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,103
So it's cool.

750
00:28:53,103 --> 00:28:55,225
One of the things that I'm
very fascinated about is,

751
00:28:55,225 --> 00:28:57,789
it seems so clear who's gonna win this,

752
00:28:57,789 --> 00:29:00,027
or who's gonna be the platforms,

753
00:29:00,027 --> 00:29:01,943
I've an enormous amount of curiosity of,

754
00:29:01,943 --> 00:29:04,245
is there somebody that
we're not thinking about

755
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:05,995
jumping in, you know?

756
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:11,898
So, I'm looking for people
that are aligned with me,

757
00:29:11,898 --> 00:29:15,357
specifically in this
space, of like, yeah, like,

758
00:29:15,357 --> 00:29:18,301
I really have to be thinking
about 36 months from now,

759
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:19,826
there's just not gonna be enough users,

760
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:23,588
enough discoverability, enough adoption,

761
00:29:23,588 --> 00:29:25,203
and so, what am I gonna do about it?

762
00:29:25,203 --> 00:29:27,589
And anybody who's just
gonna rely on, you know,

763
00:29:27,589 --> 00:29:30,960
the demo day, or the
introductions you guys make,

764
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,091
or they're gonna raise some capital,

765
00:29:33,091 --> 00:29:35,774
is fine, and I'll probably
miss some good ones,

766
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,173
because that is an absolute
blueprint to success,

767
00:29:39,173 --> 00:29:41,347
I guess I'm just looking
for a little more ghetto.

768
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:43,495
A little more scrappiness, you know?

769
00:29:43,495 --> 00:29:46,931
Somebody who's so obsessed
with this being their lives.

770
00:29:46,931 --> 00:29:48,992
Do you know how many people
are gonna be happily,

771
00:29:48,992 --> 00:29:50,819
you know what bugs me the most?

772
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:53,850
Is if, tomorrow, it all melted,

773
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:58,371
I have millions of dollars
sitting in the system in limbo,

774
00:29:58,371 --> 00:29:59,789
I'm just gonna get emails that are like,

775
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:01,513
"Hey, Gary, as you know,
the world collapsed,

776
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:04,763
you know, super sad it didn't work out,

777
00:30:06,023 --> 00:30:08,085
fucking sucks, Trump, what a dick, huh?

778
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:10,597
And, yeah, I'm going to business school,

779
00:30:10,597 --> 00:30:12,383
so we'll be shutting down next week.

780
00:30:12,383 --> 00:30:13,603
Need you to sign these."
- I learned a lot.

781
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,436
- What?

782
00:30:14,436 --> 00:30:15,269
- [Phil] I learned a lot.

783
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:16,194
- Well, Phil's bringing
up a story that I will,

784
00:30:16,194 --> 00:30:17,988
I wasn't even gonna go
there, because honestly,

785
00:30:17,988 --> 00:30:19,561
like, you just said.
- Go there, go there.

786
00:30:19,561 --> 00:30:21,111
- Dude, my fucking, he just said it,

787
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,992
and the insides of my stomach went hot.

788
00:30:22,992 --> 00:30:24,217
This dude sat in front of me,

789
00:30:24,217 --> 00:30:26,754
I'm, listen, I get that I've done it,

790
00:30:26,754 --> 00:30:29,441
but I lived in a studio apartment
with eight family members

791
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:31,231
when we came to America.

792
00:30:31,231 --> 00:30:34,593
Like, I had zero vacation
days in my life in my 20s.

793
00:30:34,593 --> 00:30:36,629
I worked so hard to where I am now.

794
00:30:36,629 --> 00:30:37,709
This dude sits in front of me,

795
00:30:37,709 --> 00:30:40,553
I wrote him a $150,000 check, personal,

796
00:30:40,553 --> 00:30:43,989
and goes, "Look, we're gonna
be shutting down the company."

797
00:30:43,989 --> 00:30:47,492
Meanwhile, you have to
understand, complete left field,

798
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:49,820
like, literally a week earlier,

799
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,699
dude's taking photos at Coachella.

800
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:55,593
And he goes, "Look, we're
gonna be shutting it down,

801
00:30:55,593 --> 00:30:56,913
just wanted to thank you, you know,

802
00:30:56,913 --> 00:30:58,356
like, just need you to sign some docs."

803
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,460
He goes, so I'm like, kinda sitting there,

804
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,922
I'm like, you know,
I'm, like, disappointed,

805
00:31:01,922 --> 00:31:04,011
but not, like, dead, I
mean, I've lost a lot,

806
00:31:04,011 --> 00:31:05,423
it wasn't that,

807
00:31:05,423 --> 00:31:07,507
but then it got crazy.

808
00:31:07,507 --> 00:31:09,664
He goes, before I said anything, he goes,

809
00:31:09,664 --> 00:31:11,435
"No, no, no, don't worry.

810
00:31:11,435 --> 00:31:12,963
I learned a lot."

811
00:31:12,963 --> 00:31:15,796
(audience laughs)

812
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,459
I was just like,

813
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:22,048
you know, so, so I think,

814
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,801
I don't, I'm not looking for that anymore.

815
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,421
He learned a lot.

816
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:30,404
- [Brit] (mumbles) after he said that.

817
00:31:30,404 --> 00:31:31,678
(audience laughs)

818
00:31:31,678 --> 00:31:33,755
- You know what, he didn't, because,

819
00:31:33,755 --> 00:31:36,580
I avert, if I had my dad's
personality, he would have.

820
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,068
I'm more, like, kind of like, silent,

821
00:31:38,068 --> 00:31:39,483
but, I, like, ate it,

822
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:41,690
you're right, he lost, because,

823
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,496
and he lost with all the investors,

824
00:31:43,496 --> 00:31:44,483
and these were, like, important,

825
00:31:44,483 --> 00:31:45,359
you know, he was lucky, you know,

826
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:47,227
he was charismatic, he
was, it was that schtick.

827
00:31:47,227 --> 00:31:49,162
He had a lot of the good angels on it,

828
00:31:49,162 --> 00:31:52,759
and, losing your name is so crazy.

829
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:54,160
But, and that's what's about to happen.

830
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,087
Whatever happens, there's so much,

831
00:31:56,087 --> 00:31:58,438
there's ungodly amounts of non-businesses

832
00:31:58,438 --> 00:32:01,471
in our world of start-up,
across all sectors,

833
00:32:01,471 --> 00:32:04,359
people are gonna go back to McKinsey

834
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:07,169
and go back to Harvard Business School.

835
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:08,231
- [Male Entrepreneur] So,
I wanna add onto that.

836
00:32:08,231 --> 00:32:10,036
I had a experience a week ago

837
00:32:10,036 --> 00:32:13,032
with a founder, who just had the idea,

838
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:15,719
was raising two million on a knee,

839
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:18,886
but only wanted to work with investors

840
00:32:19,818 --> 00:32:21,617
who invested in founders.

841
00:32:21,617 --> 00:32:23,335
And after that one hour coffee meeting,

842
00:32:23,335 --> 00:32:25,390
I had to decide whether or
not I was gonna invest in him

843
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,793
because there was so much interest in him.

844
00:32:26,793 --> 00:32:27,776
- Right.

845
00:32:27,776 --> 00:32:28,871
- [Male Entrepreneur] How
do you kind of reconcile

846
00:32:28,871 --> 00:32:30,596
the, you know, investing in people,

847
00:32:30,596 --> 00:32:32,727
and kind of the timeline (mumbles),

848
00:32:32,727 --> 00:32:35,850
like, how do you get to
know founders, how do you?

849
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:36,989
- I run the gamut.

850
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:39,027
My team will tell you that I pick

851
00:32:39,027 --> 00:32:41,106
too intuitively and too quick.

852
00:32:41,106 --> 00:32:42,836
Sometimes I can make a
decision in one second.

853
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:45,218
I basically married my wife
eight seconds into knowing her,

854
00:32:45,218 --> 00:32:48,202
you know, so I can be
pretty intuitive that way.

855
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:50,646
However, I look for cues.

856
00:32:50,646 --> 00:32:52,045
Anybody that would tell me that

857
00:32:52,045 --> 00:32:53,445
that was the rules of the engagement,

858
00:32:53,445 --> 00:32:55,169
I would tell them to go fuck themselves.

859
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:57,033
You know, like, you're not
gonna put a time limit on it,

860
00:32:57,033 --> 00:32:57,866
you know what I mean?

861
00:32:57,866 --> 00:32:59,006
Like, you could have
told me after the fact,

862
00:32:59,006 --> 00:33:00,771
or after we had a nice meal,

863
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,435
you could have emailed
me kindly and been like,

864
00:33:02,435 --> 00:33:05,583
"Hey, I'm, I've got pressure,
and I'm gonna move,"

865
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,108
but, like, that's just his psychology move

866
00:33:08,108 --> 00:33:10,824
to get people to make
irrational decisions,

867
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:12,773
which means I don't like you.

868
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:13,606
You know what I mean?

869
00:33:13,606 --> 00:33:16,095
So, but, yeah, I can run the gamut.

870
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:18,186
Sometimes it's people you've
known for a very long time,

871
00:33:18,186 --> 00:33:21,519
other times, it's just, you know, right?

872
00:33:22,453 --> 00:33:23,892
The reason you like a song
the first time you hear it,

873
00:33:23,892 --> 00:33:26,917
or fell in love, or
found your partner here.

874
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:28,786
It doesn't have to be that complicated.

875
00:33:28,786 --> 00:33:32,397
I'm overly intuitive
and not analytical, so,

876
00:33:32,397 --> 00:33:35,357
you know, mine tend to be quick,

877
00:33:35,357 --> 00:33:37,969
or intuitive, and I'm okay
with that, as long, you know,

878
00:33:37,969 --> 00:33:41,341
I'm sure for the people that
have been successful like me

879
00:33:41,341 --> 00:33:44,881
with that style, your wins
so outweigh your losses,

880
00:33:44,881 --> 00:33:46,305
so you win in a macro.

881
00:33:46,305 --> 00:33:49,260
I like, you know, one
thing I would tell you,

882
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,077
whether you're like me or
completely the other way

883
00:33:51,077 --> 00:33:52,864
and everything's gotta be about the math,

884
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,029
or, anything in between,
it's just so much more fun

885
00:33:56,029 --> 00:33:58,693
to die on your sword
than on somebody else's.

886
00:33:58,693 --> 00:34:01,988
So, regardless of what, I think I'm

887
00:34:01,988 --> 00:34:04,577
a pretty compelling communicator,

888
00:34:04,577 --> 00:34:07,474
if this is not intuitively
what you believe, like,

889
00:34:07,474 --> 00:34:08,542
let it be.

890
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:09,766
You know, like, there's gonna be plenty

891
00:34:09,766 --> 00:34:12,546
of voices coming through
here, plenty of opinions,

892
00:34:12,547 --> 00:34:14,895
if I could leave you with anything,

893
00:34:14,895 --> 00:34:18,248
just die on your own sword, it's better.

894
00:34:18,248 --> 00:34:20,224
Because then you don't have regret,

895
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,974
and regret is poison.

896
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:28,522
- [Male Entrepreneur] I wanna
ask a bunch more questions.

897
00:34:28,522 --> 00:34:31,355
Did you have to get,
- What's that?

898
00:34:34,547 --> 00:34:35,966
- [Male Entrepreneur] This
is kind of, a little fanboy.

899
00:34:35,967 --> 00:34:36,876
- Please, go anywhere.

900
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:38,190
- I was wondering if you could apply

901
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,569
some of what you're saying to, like,

902
00:34:39,569 --> 00:34:42,606
the Wine Library TV days, because for me,

903
00:34:42,606 --> 00:34:43,911
like, that was life-changing.

904
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:46,595
Not only because I'd had a wine snob dad,

905
00:34:46,596 --> 00:34:48,424
I was willing to talk
different about wine,

906
00:34:48,424 --> 00:34:49,928
but also, I think it's,
like, a good, for me,

907
00:34:49,928 --> 00:34:51,715
in my mind, to get practical (mumbles)

908
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,068
of applying some of this to survival,

909
00:34:53,068 --> 00:34:55,210
- Hundred percent.
- it's a great example I know.

910
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,501
So if you could talk about
- Of course, man.

911
00:34:57,501 --> 00:34:58,995
- A funny anecdote to that.
- First of all, anybody else

912
00:34:58,995 --> 00:35:00,999
that wants to recall those things,

913
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:03,049
it makes me feel amazing, so thank you.

914
00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:04,622
Look, that was a perfect example.

915
00:35:04,622 --> 00:35:06,914
I saw YouTube, it was four months old,

916
00:35:06,914 --> 00:35:08,704
nobody knew what the hell it was,

917
00:35:08,704 --> 00:35:10,949
and, in one second of looking at it,

918
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:12,626
I'm like, "This is gonna
fucking change the world."

919
00:35:12,626 --> 00:35:15,408
And, I, you know, I
had never given a talk,

920
00:35:15,408 --> 00:35:16,894
you know, now this seems insane,

921
00:35:16,894 --> 00:35:20,697
but I'm 30 years old and I've
never given a public talk,

922
00:35:20,697 --> 00:35:22,020
I never was in front of a camera,

923
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,622
I was a businessman.

924
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,073
Like, I didn't, you know?

925
00:35:25,073 --> 00:35:26,275
I was a good salesman, that's,

926
00:35:26,275 --> 00:35:28,237
that's where this schtick
came from, but, like,

927
00:35:28,237 --> 00:35:31,860
so, why, I thought it was a good idea

928
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,449
to send one of my stock guys to Best Buy

929
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:36,329
and get a camera and start a wine show,

930
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:39,219
and the truth is, I immediately, you know,

931
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:42,254
I am who I am, I thought
I was gonna do QVC.

932
00:35:42,254 --> 00:35:43,516
I thought he was gonna come back,

933
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,136
I was gonna pick three wines
that we were sitting on

934
00:35:45,136 --> 00:35:47,069
that weren't moving or
whatever the fuck, right,

935
00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:49,501
put them in a camera and go.

936
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:53,492
And literally, from day
one, he's setting up,

937
00:35:53,492 --> 00:35:55,515
we're setting up the table,
I switch out the wines,

938
00:35:55,515 --> 00:35:58,075
I go with some premium, I know
what they are, Vérité Wines,

939
00:35:58,075 --> 00:35:59,590
some real high-end wines,

940
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,551
and the light goes on in the camera,

941
00:36:01,551 --> 00:36:03,559
and I'm like, "Fuck, man.

942
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:06,354
If I go to a party in a
year," this is all going,

943
00:36:06,354 --> 00:36:07,803
you know how fast, you could
think of a million things

944
00:36:07,803 --> 00:36:10,818
really fast sometimes, "If
I go to a party in a year,

945
00:36:10,818 --> 00:36:12,401
and somebody hands me a glass of wine

946
00:36:12,401 --> 00:36:14,340
and says, 'Hey, try this, do you like it,'

947
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,257
I have to, basically, not be wrong.

948
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,344
It can't be something that
I told them was phenomenal

949
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,667
and I'm like, this is shit."

950
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:23,548
So, basically, as I'm going, like,

951
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,095
as I'm in the first minute, you know,

952
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:27,106
it's funny, if I watch
Wine Library episode one,

953
00:36:27,106 --> 00:36:30,363
and I made a thousand of them,
to give you guys context,

954
00:36:30,363 --> 00:36:33,594
I know exactly the moment
in the first five minutes

955
00:36:33,594 --> 00:36:37,357
where I made the decision,
"Fuck, no selling."

956
00:36:37,357 --> 00:36:39,301
Every episode for the rest of my life,

957
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:42,153
and it caused me so much headaches,

958
00:36:42,153 --> 00:36:44,739
talk about the long game,
I lost relationships,

959
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:48,417
you know, there's people you
do business with for 11 years,

960
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,250
and you saw it, you know
how I did that show.

961
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,126
- Yeah.
- I'm like, this wine

962
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,578
tastes like a cow shit in your face.

963
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:54,400
You know, like, they don't like that.

964
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,483
You know, like, and so,
it was super interesting,

965
00:36:59,638 --> 00:37:03,330
and nobody watched it
for the first 17 months

966
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,460
that I did it, nobody watched it.

967
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,671
Just, nobody watched it.

968
00:37:07,671 --> 00:37:10,148
And, for the first eight years that I,

969
00:37:10,148 --> 00:37:12,554
2006, 1998, for the first eight years

970
00:37:12,554 --> 00:37:14,270
that I ran my dad's wine business,

971
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,725
every month, the revenue
grew more than 20%

972
00:37:16,725 --> 00:37:19,595
from the year prior's monthly revenue.

973
00:37:19,595 --> 00:37:20,428
Every month.

974
00:37:20,428 --> 00:37:23,740
And 50, 70, 100, but never
a month that wasn't 20.

975
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:27,351
The first month that I did
Wine Library TV, it was flat.

976
00:37:27,351 --> 00:37:28,552
And then it started declining

977
00:37:28,552 --> 00:37:30,663
because all of my energy was going.

978
00:37:30,663 --> 00:37:33,951
And so, you know, I was, you know,

979
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,240
that was a different level of survival

980
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,719
than what you're dealing with, that was,

981
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:40,418
the thought of declining or
flattening versus growing,

982
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:43,115
was I using, the best use of my time?

983
00:37:43,115 --> 00:37:44,607
But intuitively, I knew

984
00:37:44,607 --> 00:37:47,185
that everybody would watch YouTube videos.

985
00:37:47,185 --> 00:37:51,186
Where I made a huge mistake
was I made a financial one.

986
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,786
If you remember this, there
was a start-up called Vidler

987
00:37:53,786 --> 00:37:57,177
that let you tag, so, everybody was making

988
00:37:57,177 --> 00:38:00,350
30 second videos, I was
making 20 minute videos,

989
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:03,159
and I was tasting wines
every seven minutes,

990
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:05,191
so I, this start-up came
to me and offered me

991
00:38:05,191 --> 00:38:07,008
seven percent of their company,

992
00:38:07,008 --> 00:38:09,528
because I was, like, the
breakout YouTube star,

993
00:38:09,528 --> 00:38:12,380
to move over and exclusively go on Vidler,

994
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,429
and they had this tech
that was IP protected,

995
00:38:14,429 --> 00:38:15,782
so you could just click the third wine

996
00:38:15,782 --> 00:38:18,137
and just start watching,
YouTube didn't have that yet,

997
00:38:18,137 --> 00:38:21,232
still, you know, so,
it was a huge mistake.

998
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:25,377
It was the one time in my career
I made a financial mistake,

999
00:38:25,377 --> 00:38:28,152
I picked finances over where I thought

1000
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:30,869
the market would spend their time.

1001
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:33,619
You know, and so, I just, I knew,

1002
00:38:36,632 --> 00:38:39,632
guys, you know this is gonna happen.

1003
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:43,193
Like, it's super cool,
like, this is fun for me,

1004
00:38:43,193 --> 00:38:46,136
like, this is why I love innovation.

1005
00:38:46,136 --> 00:38:47,076
You get that thrill again.

1006
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:49,247
I'm sure you have this feeling right now.

1007
00:38:49,247 --> 00:38:50,559
Because I have it with this space.

1008
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:52,439
It's that same feeling.

1009
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:55,335
You know, it's probably why
discovering bands is fun, right?

1010
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:57,525
Like, I'm sure the people
that are great at it are like,

1011
00:38:57,525 --> 00:38:59,754
when they see it, they see it, like,

1012
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,197
do you know how cool it
is that every one of you,

1013
00:39:02,197 --> 00:39:04,606
right now, are either
gonna have your thing win,

1014
00:39:04,606 --> 00:39:06,883
or in 10 years, the thing
you're working on right now

1015
00:39:06,883 --> 00:39:10,050
in a different iteration is gonna win?

1016
00:39:12,201 --> 00:39:13,947
Like, either in 10 years,
you're gonna be like,

1017
00:39:13,947 --> 00:39:15,577
"Let me tell you how I did it,"

1018
00:39:15,577 --> 00:39:17,278
or you're gonna be like,
"Hey, you know this thing

1019
00:39:17,278 --> 00:39:18,111
that we're all doing, yeah, I did that

1020
00:39:18,111 --> 00:39:21,267
back in 2017.
(audience laughs)

1021
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:23,988
we fucked it up, but, you know."

1022
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:28,155
That's cool, you don't have
