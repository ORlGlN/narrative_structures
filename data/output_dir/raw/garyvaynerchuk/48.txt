1
00:00:00,272 --> 00:00:02,719
- And then we'll see everybody
else who says "Entrepreneur"

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:05,110
in their Instagram profile right now

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,489
when they're working in
Bank of America in 24 months

4
00:00:08,489 --> 00:00:10,500
and so that's what I'm waiting for.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,382
I'm most excited for

6
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:13,382
and waiting for

7
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:14,656
and hoping for

8
00:00:14,656 --> 00:00:18,086
complete global economic carnage

9
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:22,139
so that we can weed out
the B and C and D players.

10
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:25,056
(electronic music)

11
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:32,528
("It's All Love" by Hi-Rez)

12
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:43,641
Hey Vlog.

13
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:45,342
CES, working, busy.

14
00:00:45,342 --> 00:00:46,356
Babin wanted something,

15
00:00:46,356 --> 00:00:47,934
but I don't have much to say,

16
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:49,736
I've been in fucking meetings all day.

17
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:51,907
That's it, see ya.

18
00:00:51,907 --> 00:00:52,740
Nice view!

19
00:00:56,702 --> 00:00:57,535
Amazing.

20
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:02,301
("It's All Love" by Hi-Rez)

21
00:01:11,924 --> 00:01:12,841
Understood!

22
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,754
How ya doin', Em?

23
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:22,723
- Good, this is the busiest
conference I've ever been to.

24
00:01:22,723 --> 00:01:24,306
- Where am I going?

25
00:01:27,163 --> 00:01:28,080
Right here?

26
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:32,162
Let's set this scene up!

27
00:01:32,162 --> 00:01:34,142
Babin, stop crying!

28
00:01:34,142 --> 00:01:35,909
It's just fuckin CES, I'm busy!

29
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,365
I mean, I can't always

30
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:39,073
- [Em] Any content for the vlog?

31
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:41,047
- It's up to you, Alesksa Mara!

32
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:42,005
(Em giggles)

33
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:43,797
It's up to you, Aleska Mara, to fix this!

34
00:01:43,797 --> 00:01:45,124
- [Em] We all have name tags, I got Jamal!

35
00:01:45,124 --> 00:01:46,651
- Aleska, it's me!

36
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:47,818
It's me, Luis!

37
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:50,766
I'm about to give a talk here with Samsung

38
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:52,751
and Entrepreneur Magazine and

39
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:53,884
Hi!
- This is Idira from Samsung

40
00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:55,055
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

41
00:01:55,055 --> 00:01:56,013
Good to see you.
- Thanks for having me.

42
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:56,846
- Yeah, of course!

43
00:01:56,846 --> 00:01:59,062
- And so, only event I'm doing here at CES

44
00:01:59,062 --> 00:02:01,420
a small little group, should be good.

45
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,772
Not exactly sure what I'm gonna talk about

46
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:04,446
but I'll figure it the fuck out

47
00:02:04,446 --> 00:02:06,344
it'll be the meat of this episode,

48
00:02:06,344 --> 00:02:08,677
I've just been busy as fuck!

49
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:12,571
Fuck.

50
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:13,653
- Very nice.

51
00:02:13,653 --> 00:02:14,486
- Student of the University of Florida

52
00:02:14,486 --> 00:02:15,603
- Very nice there

53
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:16,444
- For you
- Great.

54
00:02:16,444 --> 00:02:18,013
- It's sitting in your chair.
- Awesome.

55
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,670
- I am going to introduce the moderator

56
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,692
- Right.
- He will introduce you.

57
00:02:20,692 --> 00:02:21,525
- Yeah, yeah, you?

58
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:23,341
- Good week?
- Thanks for doin this!

59
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:26,044
- No problem, man, super happy to be here!

60
00:02:26,044 --> 00:02:27,127
- 'member that?
- That's a really great part

61
00:02:27,127 --> 00:02:28,423
of that talk, that two hour talk in LA!

62
00:02:28,423 --> 00:02:29,825
- Yup, that was it, man.
- Startup Grind.

63
00:02:29,825 --> 00:02:30,658
I remember it.

64
00:02:30,658 --> 00:02:31,541
- I follow you all the time, man

65
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:32,374
- Thank you, brother.
- To this day,

66
00:02:32,374 --> 00:02:34,934
you've been just like,
a big guiding factor.

67
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:36,085
- Thank you brother.
- In motivating me

68
00:02:36,085 --> 00:02:37,559
and keeping me on track

69
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,439
- Thank you brother

70
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,272
- [Man] We're about to start

71
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:40,105
- Thank you.

72
00:02:40,105 --> 00:02:43,972
- Thank you so much, I'm
excited to be here and see you!

73
00:02:43,972 --> 00:02:45,254
- [Jason] Just start this thing!

74
00:02:45,254 --> 00:02:47,245
So Gary, come on up, thank you!

75
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:48,955
What kinda conversations
are you having here?

76
00:02:48,955 --> 00:02:49,788
What are you seeing,

77
00:02:49,788 --> 00:02:50,746
or who are you meeting with

78
00:02:50,746 --> 00:02:51,731
and you're really excited about?

79
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:52,629
What kinda technologies do you see

80
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:53,811
that you're really excited about?

81
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:56,041
- I think what's very unique about CES

82
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:59,980
is that people get very
excited about what's coming

83
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,397
so I'm always a big fan of...

84
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,498
Some of you here follow my content.

85
00:03:06,498 --> 00:03:08,904
I'm very big on "Day Trading Attention."

86
00:03:08,904 --> 00:03:10,261
What that really means is

87
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:12,302
I like being practical.

88
00:03:12,302 --> 00:03:15,214
I don't like when people
think I'm a futurist

89
00:03:15,214 --> 00:03:16,464
or a disruptor.

90
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:18,480
I don't think I am.

91
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,078
I actually think all I am
is just very practical.

92
00:03:21,078 --> 00:03:21,969
I try to pay attention

93
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:25,058
to what you're paying attention
to at scale right now,

94
00:03:25,058 --> 00:03:28,244
and how do I bring you
value in those environments.

95
00:03:28,244 --> 00:03:30,192
So the thing that's
interesting to me here is

96
00:03:30,192 --> 00:03:32,955
everyone's talkin' 'bout voice, and IoT,

97
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:35,575
and connected this and connected that,

98
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:37,680
which is absolutely gonna happen.

99
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,497
I'm super excited about it.

100
00:03:39,497 --> 00:03:42,155
I can't wait to never
leave my fuckin' room

101
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,997
It's all gonna be great

102
00:03:43,997 --> 00:03:46,717
but for me, I think it clouds a lot

103
00:03:46,717 --> 00:03:48,153
which is...

104
00:03:48,153 --> 00:03:50,888
I would say the far
majority of companies here

105
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:52,723
will go out of business

106
00:03:52,723 --> 00:03:55,423
before the promise of what
they're trying to deliver on

107
00:03:55,423 --> 00:03:57,663
becomes consumer at scale

108
00:03:57,663 --> 00:04:01,154
and so for me, I'm excited but tempered

109
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:05,321
in trying to help people stay
alive for the holy grail.

110
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:08,728
There's a lot of people in 2007

111
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:11,528
that thought "Social
Media" was gonna be big.

112
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:13,823
The difference between
me and a lot of them

113
00:04:13,823 --> 00:04:16,031
was I knew how to stay alive

114
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:20,198
from 2007 to 2013, before
it became really really.

115
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:25,037
And for me, that's what CES
always reminds me which is:

116
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:28,478
great, I can't wait to have my robot

117
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:30,016
wipe my ass,

118
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:31,621
but before that happens,

119
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:35,790
make sure that you're
still in business in 2027

120
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,957
and so there's a little bit
too much 2027 talk for me

121
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:42,689
but at the flip side,

122
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:45,797
I love that people are inspired, excited,

123
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:48,355
meeting new people, bouncing ideas,

124
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,101
thinking about things differently.

125
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:52,536
And I would argue for everybody
I'm looking at right now,

126
00:04:52,536 --> 00:04:56,332
if you see something that
allows you to then use that

127
00:04:56,332 --> 00:04:59,916
as a proxy to be practical
over the next 24 months,

128
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,166
that, to me, is interesting

129
00:05:03,432 --> 00:05:05,250
in the way I think about CES.

130
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,621
I used to come to events like this

131
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:07,904
and nobody knew who the hell I was

132
00:05:07,904 --> 00:05:09,543
and I was in the wine business

133
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,845
and it made no sense for me to be here.

134
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:12,744
I'm an extrovert.

135
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:15,625
It's comfortable for me to do
what I recommend these people,

136
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,432
which is: if you literally
don't know each other,

137
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:21,085
it's probably a good idea to say "Hello."

138
00:05:21,085 --> 00:05:23,929
You've got a common point of
view of where the world's going

139
00:05:23,929 --> 00:05:26,387
as many as people as there are here,

140
00:05:26,387 --> 00:05:30,025
it's still a very tiny
percentage of the net score.

141
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:31,733
And so for me, it was comfortable

142
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:33,374
to come to something like this,

143
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,479
listen to people, and say "hello,"

144
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:37,272
grab a business card, send an e-mail,

145
00:05:37,272 --> 00:05:38,919
try to build a relationship.

146
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:40,834
I'm a big believer in serendipity.

147
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:43,776
I didn't chase the people on stage.

148
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,269
I knew equally that the person
sitting right next to me

149
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:50,306
in the 13 year macro
might be valuable to me

150
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:53,577
and so my advice to everybody
who's "not being chased down"

151
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:55,079
and cameras and all this

152
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,915
is to say "hello" to
the person next to them

153
00:05:57,915 --> 00:06:00,278
because that's how life actually works.

154
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:04,061
Now, there's a lot of
people here that are shy.

155
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:06,280
I grew up with parents that had an accent

156
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,921
this is an international show.

157
00:06:08,921 --> 00:06:10,801
There's a million things that
I can run through my mind

158
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:11,798
from the Psychology of

159
00:06:11,798 --> 00:06:14,494
why every person here now
won't look to the person

160
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:16,531
to the left and right and say "hello,"

161
00:06:16,531 --> 00:06:18,413
it still doesn't make the advice wrong.

162
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:19,664
That is the ROI.

163
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:21,272
The ROI, my friends,

164
00:06:21,272 --> 00:06:22,895
everything you've seen here,

165
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:25,489
you could watch on the
fuckin' internet next week.

166
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:26,958
(audience laughing)

167
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,535
The ROI of coming to this thing

168
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:33,202
is to engage with the people
next to you right this second.

169
00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:34,423
There's nothing I'm gonna say right now

170
00:06:34,423 --> 00:06:37,074
that you haven't heard me
say in some other version

171
00:06:37,074 --> 00:06:38,785
for the last fuckin' decade.

172
00:06:38,785 --> 00:06:39,735
- And you gotta remember

173
00:06:39,735 --> 00:06:41,753
that everybody's here to meet people.

174
00:06:41,753 --> 00:06:42,586
That's the funny thing,

175
00:06:42,586 --> 00:06:44,421
is like, you're great at
- Yes, but

176
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:45,254
Go ahead, please.

177
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:48,542
- No, you're afraid of reaching out

178
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,058
but if you wanna connect

179
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:51,011
and you have to remember

180
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,190
that the other people are
thinking the exact same thing.

181
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,344
Then, when people come,

182
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:55,177
When you ask people,

183
00:06:55,177 --> 00:06:56,526
"Why did you come to something like this?"

184
00:06:56,526 --> 00:06:57,674
"Why do you go to some conference?"

185
00:06:57,674 --> 00:06:59,060
the answer is always
"To meet other people."

186
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,299
That's always, always
the number one thing.

187
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:02,135
It's not for like,
watching people on stage.

188
00:07:02,135 --> 00:07:02,968
Unless it's you.

189
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:06,482
But otherwise, it's to meet
the people who are there!

190
00:07:06,482 --> 00:07:09,482
- Yeah, in South by Southwest 2007,

191
00:07:09,482 --> 00:07:13,408
Mark Zuckerberg asked me to
introduce him to Kevin Rose,

192
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:15,075
the founder of Digg.

193
00:07:16,663 --> 00:07:18,848
The world changes.

194
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:20,287
And so...

195
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:22,383
the people that get to
sit on the big stage,

196
00:07:22,383 --> 00:07:23,875
things like this, that, the other,

197
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:24,875
they change.

198
00:07:26,316 --> 00:07:28,786
But you have access to everybody

199
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:31,519
there's fuckin' hundreds of
thousands of people here.

200
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,686
I'm just a very big fan of
saying "hello" versus pitching.

201
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:39,935
I wrote a book called
"Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook"

202
00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:42,339
because I really wanted to
establish the way I think of it

203
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:44,103
which is: I just think

204
00:07:44,103 --> 00:07:46,119
that Herb and Greg should know each other.

205
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:49,191
I don't think that Greg should
pitch Herb his business.

206
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:51,993
I think they should just say
"hello" and create context

207
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:54,797
and then something may come from that.

208
00:07:54,797 --> 00:07:56,316
And I just believe in that.

209
00:07:56,316 --> 00:07:57,557
I don't know what else to tell you

210
00:07:57,557 --> 00:08:00,200
I think it's very practical.

211
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,861
- Let's talk as to technology
- Greg, say hi to Herb.

212
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:05,210
(audience laughing)

213
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,610
- Greg and Marco

214
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,943
Marco and guy's....tag is...

215
00:08:09,904 --> 00:08:12,563
Robert, now you know each other.

216
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:13,619
They already know each other!

217
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:14,794
Alright, well, whatever.

218
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:19,069
So, Gary, VaynerMedia's got
a division called VaynerSmart

219
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:19,953
- Yes.

220
00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:23,671
- Where you are using new technologies,

221
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,228
AR, VR, the internet of things

222
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:28,012
to connect more ends with consumers

223
00:08:28,012 --> 00:08:30,088
talk to me about being
on that cutting edge,

224
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:31,718
how you stay on it.

225
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:34,968
- I got very focused on IoT products...

226
00:08:35,977 --> 00:08:38,616
like, literally your beer
re-ordering itself for you

227
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:41,504
smart refrigerator being
more important than anything

228
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:42,364
but the reality is,

229
00:08:42,364 --> 00:08:45,773
VaynerSmart was named three
years ago when I started it

230
00:08:45,773 --> 00:08:47,999
and the promise didn't come true,

231
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:51,709
meaning, it's not moving
as fast as I want it to,

232
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:53,413
thought it might,

233
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:55,560
so now what VaynerSmart does, really,

234
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,324
is an obnoxious amount of Alexa skills

235
00:08:58,324 --> 00:08:59,848
and Google Home skills

236
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:01,903
and even podcast marketing

237
00:09:01,903 --> 00:09:04,840
which is very basic, that can be in media

238
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,275
because voice has become very real.

239
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:11,470
I'm spending an enormous amount
of time thinking about that

240
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,925
and so, VaynerSmart itself is
probably gonna get rebranded

241
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:18,642
because it's encompassing
with AR and machine learning.

242
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,231
I'm starting to realize: okay,

243
00:09:20,231 --> 00:09:22,907
the things that I know are
gonna happen in a 10 year macro,

244
00:09:22,907 --> 00:09:26,610
but I don't know exactly when
and how it's going to pop

245
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,099
I need to create a division

246
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:30,582
where it's highly not profitable

247
00:09:30,582 --> 00:09:33,026
because I'm just investing

248
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:35,851
and so VaynerSmart and some of the ML,

249
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:38,925
and AI, and AR stuff is there

250
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:41,326
and then stuff that's even further out,

251
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:43,172
like VR consumer

252
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:45,817
or some of the connected
stuff we're seeing here

253
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:48,257
that will just sit in my investing world

254
00:09:48,257 --> 00:09:51,993
and networking world not
as an official department.

255
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:52,826
- Time is the problem.

256
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,315
Was it because it's hard
to move an organization

257
00:09:55,315 --> 00:09:57,485
at a speed that technology's changing?

258
00:09:57,485 --> 00:09:59,687
- No, the technology hasn't delivered

259
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:02,488
on the promise of its speed.

260
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:04,064
I don't know one fucking consumer product

261
00:10:04,064 --> 00:10:05,374
that's reordered itself

262
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:08,719
or itself for anybody in this hall

263
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:09,937
It's always about...

264
00:10:09,937 --> 00:10:13,520
My mistakes in my career
are always timing.

265
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,513
Always.

266
00:10:17,513 --> 00:10:20,384
I understand consumer behavior so well

267
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:22,038
that it's been my calling card.

268
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:26,711
I really know that everybody's
gonna do a lot of things here

269
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:29,324
online dating was obvious.

270
00:10:29,324 --> 00:10:31,649
I didn't think it was weird
dudes in their basements.

271
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:33,283
I thought it was gonna be Tinder

272
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:36,730
and I invested in Yobongo,
and One, and Highlight,

273
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,916
and everything,

274
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:42,634
I got unlucky that Tinder
was incubated inside of IAC.

275
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:43,944
I knew that was gonna happen.

276
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,527
Everybody here

277
00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:49,457
is going to be very deep in IoT and voice

278
00:10:49,457 --> 00:10:51,891
and order their toothpaste
while they're...

279
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:53,393
it's all happening

280
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:55,447
it's not the tech, the technology...

281
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:58,258
so much of the promise here

282
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:01,504
is going to be four to six
years later than they said

283
00:11:01,504 --> 00:11:03,942
when they talked to you at the booth.

284
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:08,156
So we move fast as fuck, 'cause
I'm willin' to lose money.

285
00:11:08,156 --> 00:11:10,406
The technology wasn't fast.

286
00:11:12,974 --> 00:11:15,123
- How do you stay...

287
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:19,502
are you trying to plan out
to the four to six years

288
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:21,866
when something that is talked about now

289
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:24,529
is actually going to
- Always.

290
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:29,112
Yeah, I lost a fortune last
year on voice strategists

291
00:11:29,112 --> 00:11:32,241
'cause I could taste that
it was gonna be now, right?

292
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:34,523
And whether it was 2018 scopes

293
00:11:34,523 --> 00:11:36,465
which I've signed with clients,

294
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:39,583
or 2019, I knew it wasn't gonna be 2020.

295
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:43,879
I can't say that for a lot
of the technology we see here

296
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:45,181
so for me, I'm not scared

297
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:49,191
if I think it's really close
within a year, year and a half.

298
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:52,285
Look, I bought cryptocurrency in 2014

299
00:11:52,285 --> 00:11:53,452
but it wasn't because

300
00:11:53,452 --> 00:11:54,778
I didn't know "when" or "how"

301
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:56,029
and I didn't even know "if."

302
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:57,822
I really didn't.

303
00:11:57,822 --> 00:11:58,942
I just knew "maybe".

304
00:11:58,942 --> 00:12:00,460
Or "kinda", or "probably".

305
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,960
Or "why it could".

306
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,548
I think the fundamental
separation that I have

307
00:12:08,548 --> 00:12:10,362
is really predicated on two things.

308
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,467
I have empathy, so I'm thinking about

309
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:13,861
what you're thinking about

310
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:18,100
and number two, I don't care
about money in the short term.

311
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,611
If you really actually
understand what I just said

312
00:12:20,611 --> 00:12:21,830
on those two things,

313
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,604
if you're actually consumer-centric

314
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:27,593
and you don't need money in the short term

315
00:12:27,593 --> 00:12:30,676
you always look like a fuckin' genius

316
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,528
- I don't like people

317
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:35,080
and I don't like companies and businesses

318
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,830
that are ideological.

319
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,868
There's way too many enthusiasts here

320
00:12:39,868 --> 00:12:43,178
that would like to see this shit happen.

321
00:12:43,178 --> 00:12:45,544
I don't like to anything to happen

322
00:12:45,544 --> 00:12:46,925
I just wanna try to figure out

323
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:49,059
what I think is going to happen

324
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,837
and a lot of times,
that's put me in a place

325
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,225
where people judged me and made fun of me

326
00:12:54,225 --> 00:12:55,891
until they did it.

327
00:12:55,891 --> 00:12:57,072
All my friends made fun of me

328
00:12:57,072 --> 00:12:59,390
that I signed a K-Swiss sneaker deal

329
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,875
'cause I had the "audacity"
to think it would work

330
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,359
until it all sold out in four hours

331
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:07,518
and then they stopped laughing.

332
00:13:07,518 --> 00:13:08,653
And the reason it worked

333
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:12,871
was 'cause I "understood"
where attention sat, right?

334
00:13:12,871 --> 00:13:14,808
And that's how I think about the world.

335
00:13:14,808 --> 00:13:15,793
- When something works, you're a genius

336
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:17,203
and when it doesn't work, you're a fool.

337
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:18,764
- Success has unlimited fathers.

338
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,781
Now everybody thinks they were involved

339
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:22,409
like Babin thinks he's the reason

340
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,381
the K-Swiss sneakers sold, right?

341
00:13:24,381 --> 00:13:27,354
But failure has none, right?

342
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:28,729
But that's what makes it fun.

343
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:30,880
If you're in a place
where you're comfortable

344
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,512
with accepting your losses,

345
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:36,071
I'm proud to say up here that
I've had to pivot VaynerSmart

346
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:38,634
'cause the timing of IoT hasn't worked

347
00:13:38,634 --> 00:13:40,286
in the way that I thought it would.

348
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,187
That's comfortable to me.

349
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,334
- It means you're watching your market.

350
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:44,117
- Yeah, to me, that's comfortable

351
00:13:44,117 --> 00:13:46,852
I'm so sad that so many
of you don't do things

352
00:13:46,852 --> 00:13:49,147
because you're worried about being judged.

353
00:13:49,147 --> 00:13:50,476
It makes me sad.

354
00:13:50,476 --> 00:13:51,309
That sucks!

355
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:52,988
Fuck, you know?

356
00:13:52,988 --> 00:13:54,821
To me, that's my loss.

357
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:57,159
What's that got to do with you?

358
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:00,540
I don't give a shit what you think, Marco!

359
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,417
I'm doin' my thing!

360
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:03,567
And so when you start getting comfortable

361
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:06,097
with losing in the micro

362
00:14:06,097 --> 00:14:08,021
well, then, you can
really start doing things

363
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:10,419
and so for me, that's why
it's comfortable to day trade.

364
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:13,248
If you day trade, you're gonna miss a lot

365
00:14:13,248 --> 00:14:15,315
you just have to make more than you miss.

366
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:18,883
And for me, I just am
comfortable in that mentality.

367
00:14:18,883 --> 00:14:20,244
- When brands come to you,

368
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:22,729
how comfortable are they with this drive?

369
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:26,858
In our story, we put this
guy on the cover in June.

370
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:28,661
The story about us and about you

371
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:29,806
focused quite a lot, actually,

372
00:14:29,806 --> 00:14:32,799
on that division between
the personal brand

373
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,654
and the brand and it was interesting to me

374
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:35,862
I didn't realize the degree

375
00:14:35,862 --> 00:14:39,003
to which you've wanted
those to feel separate.

376
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:39,961
- Yeah, I mean, look,

377
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:44,128
I don't want to be a charlatan
or a motivational speaker

378
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:46,902
those aren't interesting to me.

379
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:48,705
But I'm also willing to people

380
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:51,066
to judge me and misunderstand me

381
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:54,035
because I know how this
all plays out at the end.

382
00:14:54,035 --> 00:14:56,669
So you can boo me in the second quarter;

383
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:59,336
I'll talk to you after the game.

384
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:02,124
- And I like the way that
you think of yourself

385
00:15:02,124 --> 00:15:03,291
as an R&D lab.

386
00:15:05,173 --> 00:15:06,656
You're testing things on
yourself that you think

387
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,782
are going to pay out.

388
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,645
- Yeah!

389
00:15:09,645 --> 00:15:12,428
I didn't invest in Facebook and Twitter,

390
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,145
and Uber and Snapchat,

391
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:16,562
and buy cryptocurrency in 2014

392
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:20,729
and launch an e-commerce
site in 1996 by accident.

393
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:23,481
I didn't create a brand that allowed me

394
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:24,504
to sign a sneaker deal

395
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:28,456
bigger than 99% of athletes by accident.

396
00:15:28,456 --> 00:15:30,366
None of this is fuckin' accident.

397
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:32,816
This is me being willing to eat shit

398
00:15:32,816 --> 00:15:35,666
and have humility and
take negative feedback

399
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,409
while I try to figure shit out.

400
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:38,242
I work.

401
00:15:38,242 --> 00:15:39,719
I do shit.

402
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:42,676
While everybody's debating, I'm doing it.

403
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:46,179
And I'm willing to take
micro losses for macro wins

404
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,514
and most people aren't

405
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,607
because they want short term money

406
00:15:49,607 --> 00:15:52,502
or they actually value
other people's opinions

407
00:15:52,502 --> 00:15:53,799
over their own.

408
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,940
I realized that I mean nothing

409
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,825
which then doesn't allow
me to have the audacity

410
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,075
to be cynical or skeptical.

411
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:06,622
I'm empathetic

412
00:16:06,622 --> 00:16:08,937
and by the way, "parents
having sex at the right moment

413
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:11,068
giving me DNA", like, this is not me

414
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:12,833
but I'm like, "Why am I not skeptical?"

415
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,339
"Why am I not cynical?"

416
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:18,089
Oh, because, the fuck
does my opinion mean...

417
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,181
The amount of people
dropping their two cents

418
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,494
on social media to shit on somebody

419
00:16:23,494 --> 00:16:25,577
like they mean something?

420
00:16:26,888 --> 00:16:29,984
People try to build the
biggest building in town

421
00:16:29,984 --> 00:16:33,626
by tearing everybody else's building down.

422
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:34,531
When you have enough talent

423
00:16:34,531 --> 00:16:36,137
to just build the biggest building,

424
00:16:36,137 --> 00:16:37,740
you just build the biggest building.

425
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,776
I could give a fuck about anybody else.

426
00:16:39,776 --> 00:16:40,629
I'm doin' me.

427
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:42,812
And honestly, I wish all of you the best

428
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:44,740
and I even really hope you beat me

429
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,246
'cause that will keep me hungry

430
00:16:46,246 --> 00:16:50,413
but the truth is, I'm not worried
about other people's shit.

431
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:54,799
We're counting everybody
else's points too much.

432
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,508
Worry about your own shit.

433
00:16:56,508 --> 00:16:59,456
Now, that bubble will burst

434
00:16:59,456 --> 00:17:02,271
and then we'll get to
see who's still around

435
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,808
and then we'll see everybody
else who says "Entrepreneur"

436
00:17:04,808 --> 00:17:07,176
in their Instagram profile right now

437
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:10,373
when they're working in
Bank of America in 24 months

438
00:17:10,374 --> 00:17:12,633
and so that's what I'm waiting for.

439
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:14,439
I'm most excited for

440
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,498
and waiting for

441
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:16,492
and hoping for

442
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:19,159
complete global economic carnage

443
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:24,129
so that we can weed out
the B and C and D players.

444
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,772
- Well, Jesus, if you had
stopped talking a minute ago,

445
00:17:25,772 --> 00:17:26,993
we would've ended on a high note

446
00:17:26,993 --> 00:17:28,827
but instead, we ended on a bad!

447
00:17:28,827 --> 00:17:30,198
(audience laughing)
- I don't think, by the way

448
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:32,056
that's where I think this is so fun.

449
00:17:32,056 --> 00:17:34,235
I think that is a high note.

450
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:36,492
It's the same way I'm looking
at what's happening now:

451
00:17:36,492 --> 00:17:38,306
the truth should win.

452
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:41,718
If you're a piece of
shit: you should lose.

453
00:17:41,718 --> 00:17:45,481
If you're not a good entrepreneur:
you should have a job.

454
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,940
Merit and the truth area always
the winners in the macro.

455
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,609
We're just in a micro right now

456
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:54,297
and people are confused.

457
00:17:54,297 --> 00:17:55,130
- This is Jennifer Clark, she's brilliant.

458
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,088
- Hi, Gary
- Hi, how are you doing?

459
00:17:56,088 --> 00:17:59,595
- Alright, let's go find somewhere to sit!

460
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:00,610
- [Man] Back in the day

461
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,180
- I love it
- We work in the music sector

462
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,066
now doin like, downloads
- That's awesome.

463
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,507
- Dude, your stuff is so motivational!

464
00:18:05,507 --> 00:18:06,340
- Thank you, brother, nice meeting you.

465
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,417
- And we've been workin for a while,

466
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:08,617
are you here for CES or somethin?

467
00:18:08,617 --> 00:18:10,388
- Yeah, just meetings

468
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:11,221
Take care.
- Good meeting you, man!

469
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:12,054
- Thank you, thank you so much!

470
00:18:12,054 --> 00:18:12,887
- Thanks again, Gary!

471
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:13,720
- Thank you, man, take care!

472
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,092
- Alright, you too

473
00:18:15,092 --> 00:18:16,646
- What's happening Babin?

474
00:18:16,646 --> 00:18:20,313
("It's All Love" by Hi-Rez)

475
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:26,854
Babin, I guess this is our thing.

476
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:28,609
It's how you close it out

477
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:29,766
Alright, good day,

478
00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:31,626
just a bunch of fuckin' meetings.

479
00:18:31,626 --> 00:18:33,592
Obviously Babin got his

480
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:34,887
the meat of the episode in that talk

481
00:18:34,887 --> 00:18:35,808
that was a good talk!

482
00:18:35,808 --> 00:18:37,796
- It was a really good talk.
- Entrepreneur, Samsung

483
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:39,855
- What was your highlight of CES

484
00:18:39,855 --> 00:18:41,319
and what are you kinda
taking away from it?

485
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,198
- The quality time with you, Babin.

486
00:18:43,198 --> 00:18:45,630
- That wasn't the greatest part.

487
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,354
- Just got a lot of fuckin' meetings done.

488
00:18:47,354 --> 00:18:49,654
It's always smart to go somewhere

489
00:18:49,654 --> 00:18:52,139
where you can save time by being there.

490
00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:56,852
Three days in Vegas saved me
four fuckin' weeks of travel.

491
00:18:56,852 --> 00:18:59,831
So I'm pumped, I'm in a good mood.

492
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:00,669
Efficiency at scale

493
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:02,032
Hi Linda!

494
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:02,865
- [Linda] You goin' to dinner?

495
00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:04,501
- I am!

496
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:05,678
I am, alright, I gotta go.

497
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:07,119
Bye.
