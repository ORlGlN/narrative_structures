2017 Flip Challenge.

3
00:00:03,877 --> 00:00:06,104
There is a real arb here.

4
00:00:06,104 --> 00:00:07,867
I can smell the arbitrage.

00:00:07,867 --> 00:00:12,262
(upbeat music)

6
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,447
- Our big boss. 
Our big boss, Gary.

(woman cheers) 
Gary, Gary!

8
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:42,764
Gary's the guy.
- Thank you, my friend.

9
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,073
Think it's in the roof?

10
00:00:58,073 --> 00:00:59,069
- [Man] Yeah.

11
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:00,803
- [Gary] The roof?
- [Man] The roof.

12
00:01:00,803 --> 00:01:02,487
- [Gary] But you can't 
just replace the roof.

13
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:05,063
- [Man] The roof is weak.

14
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:05,846
- The whole building?

15
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:08,424
- Yeah, we initially got because
we wanted to change the roof.

16
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:10,323
but when the engineers came--
- But then they realized.

17
00:01:10,323 --> 00:01:11,492
They said forget it.

18
00:01:11,492 --> 00:01:12,912
Okay.

Let's go, DRock.

21
00:02:27,312 --> 00:02:28,950
- [India] DRock!
- [Gary] DRock, film me.

22
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,537
I'm confused.
- Let's go, come on over here.

23
00:02:30,537 --> 00:02:32,791
- I'm confused.

- Thank you.

25
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,026
- [Gary] Thank you very much.

26
00:02:38,228 --> 00:02:40,070
Thank you.

27
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,162
Thank you.

Thank you for your hospitality.

Thank you so much.

30
00:02:44,924 --> 00:02:46,421
- We are also grateful to you.

31
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:47,886
Yeah, so grateful.

32
00:02:47,886 --> 00:02:49,821
- [Gary] Pleasure.
Thank you for having me.

00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:51,235
Thank you.

Thank you.

Say something out loud that you

(group laughter), yeah.

45
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:58,232
You love being a contrarian.

46
00:03:58,232 --> 00:03:59,840
This is a great 
game for contrarians.

47
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,730
By the way, I actually 
know that about you.

48
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,385
And actually, I know that about
you because the number one thing

49
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:10,386
that I look for with employees
is the ones who push against me

50
00:04:10,386 --> 00:04:13,641
because they think, like 
India for example, right?

51
00:04:13,641 --> 00:04:17,958
You know push for 
the sake of pushing and

52
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,245
actually don't believe it.

53
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:21,053
I do believe what you just said.

54
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:24,723
I think the current state of
parenting is fundamentally

55
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,845
broken and will be looked upon
as a bad place because I don't

56
00:04:27,845 --> 00:04:29,378
believe in two 
cooks in the kitchen.

57
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:33,789
The blending on it 
is hurting parenting.

58
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:37,661
That divide and conquer of the
'50s and '60s actually is more

59
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:38,842
ROI positive.

60
00:04:38,842 --> 00:04:41,813
Kind of like higher thought
of two cooks in the kitchen.

61
00:04:41,813 --> 00:04:45,361
That there's a struggle, people
agreeing on these things is a

62
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:46,406
very difficult thing.

63
00:04:46,406 --> 00:04:51,854
I think we all and I think it
creates an un-united front.

64
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:52,932
I think so.

65
00:04:52,932 --> 00:04:54,812
Guys, you have to put 
teeth around it otherwise,

66
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:56,517
it's not gonna work.

67
00:04:56,517 --> 00:04:57,443
No, really.

68
00:04:57,443 --> 00:04:58,851
It's got to be 
things like parenting,

69
00:04:58,851 --> 00:05:00,229
it's got to be the taboo shit.

00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:02,740
- Well here's a 
related on to yours.

71
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,168
I think that there 
should be flights offered

72
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:07,313
with no children on them.

73
00:05:07,313 --> 00:05:09,330
- Oh, that's interesting.

74
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,732
That's just a good idea.

75
00:05:10,732 --> 00:05:13,009
(group laughter)

76
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:16,275
- [Man 2] A whole airline.

77
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,679
- Do you believe that or 
is that just a random idea?

78
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:20,789
- No I don't 
like flying with kids.

79
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:23,048
- Yeah, I've always 
known you were a bad person.

Guys, with the technology 
around headphones and

things of that nature, 
it's become a non-factor.

83
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:33,496
- No.

84
00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:35,883
- [Man 3] No way.
