1
00:00:00,345 --> 00:00:02,685
- [Cameraman] You gonna
put on your light, pal?

2
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:03,588
That was nice.

3
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:05,254
- It was nice, really good.

4
00:00:05,254 --> 00:00:08,671
(alternative rock music)

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,990
Vlog, I think it's a good episode actually

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,940
because it's a good
episode that speaks to, ah,

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,860
not everything always working out, right?

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,730
Tonight I was planning to do three,

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,940
four, five hours of live,
selling a shitload of books,

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,200
but then between some
family stuff and the team,

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,245
we decided I was gonna go
to the office and I didn't.

12
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:29,780
Logistics didn't work out.

13
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,650
We met at a pizza shop where
I thought I could do it,

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,870
but then wifi didn't
work, I couldn't go live.

15
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,350
So we just had a little
impromptu kinda one-hour meeting,

16
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,810
Irish Alex, Tyler, Tyler,

17
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,186
Andy, and D-Rock and I.

18
00:00:41,186 --> 00:00:42,019
(camera shutter snaps)

19
00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:44,164
Like it's so black and white obvious!

20
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:45,040
- [Man] I mean, YouTube.

21
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,873
- Like look at me, we're gonna cry,

22
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,530
we're gonna sit here in three years

23
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,810
when there's nothing like it,

24
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,000
and we're gonna be like,
"Dude, what the fuck."

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,490
And then we came out here,

26
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,010
we drew the brunch out of
a bucket on the street.

27
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,370
The person that's joining us, for brunch,

28
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,070
on Monday 26th is.

29
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,940
And that's it, mission not accomplished.

30
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,410
Which is okay.

31
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,920
Just gotta get punched in the
mouth and move on to tomorrow.

32
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,580
Just did not accomplish what I wanted,

33
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,547
but I'm unfazed by it
and I think, you know,

34
00:01:14,547 --> 00:01:17,320
about such a role we
haven't had an opportunity

35
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,760
to share those kind of moments,

36
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,530
And I think it will help a lot of you,

37
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,110
'cause a lot of viewers like to,

38
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,170
when doesn't it work out,
what didn't work out?

39
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,450
Today did not work out,
tonight did not work out.

40
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,500
Tomorrow's tomorrow.

41
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,333
I'm good.

42
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,807
- [Cameraman] But, we did find a dumpster.

43
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:32,120
- We did find another dumpster!

44
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,680
They fucking suck, they're
straight fucking trash,

45
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,580
that's why I fucking found a dumpster.

46
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,250
We did find another dumpster,

47
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,106
keep that high school
trash back in high school!

48
00:01:41,106 --> 00:00:00,000
