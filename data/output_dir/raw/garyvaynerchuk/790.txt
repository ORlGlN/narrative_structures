1
00:00:00,061 --> 00:00:03,928
00- The fire I see in the eyes 
of the 19, 20, 25-year-old

2
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:06,518
that feels that 
they're entitled to this

3
00:00:06,518 --> 00:00:07,642
and then the flip side

4
00:00:07,642 --> 00:00:10,147
the diminishing just 
a little bit of ashes

5
00:00:10,147 --> 00:00:12,452
with a little smoke left 
of that same entrepreneur

6
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:16,327
when they were 22 at 46
when practicality and

7
00:00:16,327 --> 00:00:20,168
family dynamics and the history 
and the market tearing down

8
00:00:20,168 --> 00:00:22,893
and the lack of that same 
opportunity has just

9
00:00:22,893 --> 00:00:27,254
dwindled down to a moment 
where they don't believe that

10
00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:29,418
they've got that shot and 
I'm here to tell you

11
00:00:29,418 --> 00:00:30,701
you absolutely do.

12
00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:33,171
There are absolutely a ton 
of entrepreneurs that started

13
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:35,770
their companies in 
their 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s

14
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,426
when it was difficult 
to do such a thing.

15
00:00:38,426 --> 00:00:39,985
Sidney Frank 
who created Grey Goose

16
00:00:39,985 --> 00:00:42,834
didn't invent his big thing 
until he was in his 70s.

17
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,423
And so, I'm desperate.

18
00:00:45,423 --> 00:00:49,233
I'm desperate to give 
you the springboard to say

19
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:50,764
"You know what? 
Instead of watching

20
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:53,012
"'House of Cards' seasons,

21
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:56,200
"instead of trying to 
go to ball games

22
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,263
"or things of that nature,

23
00:00:57,263 --> 00:01:00,388
"yeah, I do have 7 P.M. 
'til 2 in the morning

24
00:01:00,388 --> 00:01:01,293
"Monday through Friday."

25
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:04,224
Heck, for a lot of you the 
kids are out of the house.

26
00:01:04,224 --> 00:01:06,400
Let's get into the 
practicality for the

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,700
late 40s, 50s, 60-year-olds 
that are watching this right now.

28
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,107
The kids are out of the house.

29
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:12,481
Yeah, you could pick up golf

30
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:15,670
or you could finally 
start that candle company

31
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,136
because you put pretty pictures

32
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:19,358
of candles on Instagram 
and it happens.

33
00:01:19,358 --> 00:01:20,890
Learn the craft.

34
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,201
Figure out the 
opportunity at hand.

35
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:24,449
Go attack it.

36
00:01:24,449 --> 00:01:26,012
You only live once.

37
00:01:26,012 --> 00:01:27,859
When you're 90 to 
100-years-old and

38
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:29,890
you're regretting that you 
never built this business

39
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,262
and you let this era pass,
this moment where there's

40
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:35,296
so much entrepreneurial upside,

41
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:38,360
you'll regret it and 
regret is the worst.

42
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,635
I mean that's what it is.

43
00:01:41,635 --> 00:00:00,000
