1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,871
- Super excited to be here.
This is my tenth year

2
00:00:01,871 --> 00:00:06,667
at South-By, which is
insane and I'm glad to go

3
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:08,875
back to the form, at two
years ago or three years ago

4
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,959
I decided to do a full Q&amp;A,
and it was a lot of fun

5
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:14,125
and really set the
tone for what I did

6
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,500
with my last book and
things of that nature.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,208
There's a mic right up here,
I'm gonna probably talk

8
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,875
for only two or three or
four minutes, so if you've ever

9
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,125
wanted to ask a question,
I think it's a really good time

10
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,959
to actually get up
from your seat right now

11
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:29,291
and start getting
into line, so do that.

12
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,166
As you're debating
your questions, let me talk

13
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,959
to you about what's on my mind.

14
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:37,250
I know there's a
good mix of people here

15
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,333
who know quite a bit
about me, and I'm sure there's

16
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,792
a good mix of people who don't.

17
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,917
For my whole life I called
myself a businessman.

18
00:00:43,917 --> 00:00:46,041
We now call
that an entrepreneur.

19
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:49,750
I've always been selling stuff,
and what it synthesized to

20
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,875
for the people that are
paying attention to me closest

21
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:55,542
is I'm really,
really focused on attention.

22
00:00:55,542 --> 00:00:57,750
All the happiness that
I've had professionally

23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,834
has been my ability to
understand where the consumer

24
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:04,208
attention is while the
world underestimates it.

25
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:08,291
This conference, the
people in this room, are

26
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,000
easily aware of
where things are going.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,375
You wouldn't be
at this conference.

28
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,041
You wouldn't be
coming to these kind of talks

29
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,250
if you didn't understand where

30
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,125
the attention is
either or about to be.

31
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:22,125
I think this space,
our space, tends to think

32
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,708
attention is gonna be in
places a little bit too quickly.

33
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,417
For example, the
last two or three years

34
00:01:26,417 --> 00:01:28,750
I've been debating
very aggressively with a lot

35
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,959
of my Silicon Valley
friends that VR

36
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,000
on the consumer level is much
further away than we think.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,333
The technology's there, but it

38
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,500
kinda reminds
me of internet '92.

39
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,250
It's gonna take time
for normal people to,

40
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,583
how many people,
by show of hands,

41
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,375
outside of people
that are in the business,

42
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:45,542
know of a human
being who actually spends

43
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:49,250
two hours a day,
or an hour a day, in VR?

44
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,667
A human being
not in the business?

45
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:55,458
Three, so we got
a long way to go.

46
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:58,041
And I think that's the things
we need to think about, right?

47
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:02,291
But to me, I'm unemotional,
like Twitter,

48
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,959
email marketing,
YouTube, these are the platforms

49
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,208
that through the
years really helped me grow

50
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:10,458
my wine business,
my brand, my agency,

51
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,041
but the truth is I'm unemotional

52
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,125
about whether
they're here tomorrow.

53
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,125
I'm sad that
Twitter's ad product

54
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,583
isn't as good as
I'd like it to be,

55
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,166
but I would
never waste my money,

56
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,625
tell you to waste your
money, or guide my startups

57
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,083
or companies to waste
their money in that platform.

58
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:27,959
To me, I'm obsessed with
the underpriced nature

59
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,708
of Facebook's ads
Marketplace right now.

60
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,667
But the day it becomes
overpriced, I won't cry.

61
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:36,125
I'll just move on to
wherever our attention,

62
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:39,625
there's an unemotional attention
grab that I'm focused on.

63
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,291
Then I think a lot of the
other things that may happen

64
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:46,041
here is
I'm pretty undereducated,

65
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,250
in hindsight, right?

66
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,208
I was an
extraordinarily poor student.

67
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:53,583
And as I continue
to hear things, like,

68
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:54,917
there's some amazing
thing I saw on social,

69
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:58,750
my feed the other day,
a graffiti artist saying,

70
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,792
the creative people that
are winning, are the kids

71
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:05,291
that got through adulthood
without being tainted, right?

72
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,500
And I actually
think that so much

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,792
of what I think about
just comes from a pure audit.

74
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:12,583
I don't have a
preconceived notion

75
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,917
when I look at most things,
and I think that blindness.

76
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:17,208
When I went into
the agency world,

77
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,166
right now I'm
running an 800 person agency.

78
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,917
We've gone from zero to
$130 million in revenue.

79
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:25,000
When I started it,
people made fun of me, and said,

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,583
just 'cause I had a
lot of Twitter followers,

81
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,083
how was I gonna compete
with real Madison Avenue.

82
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,750
For me, the reason we've
been so grossly successful

83
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,375
is I didn't have any of the
baggage of the agency world.

84
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,417
I knew nothing about the
agency world in the same way

85
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,125
I didn't know anything
about the wine business

86
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,542
when I went into
my dad's business.

87
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:42,542
And whatever I operate for
the next two or three things

88
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:45,625
until I buy the
Jets and win Super Bowls,

89
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,625
I'm gonna be very blind to it.

90
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,125
I implore people to
make things more simple.

91
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,792
I think things
are extremely simple

92
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:55,875
if you allow
them to be that way.

93
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,667
I think we make
them very complicated,

94
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:00,083
and I think a
lot of people here,

95
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,125
how many people
are running or work

96
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,875
at a startup, 
early stage startup?

97
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,417
Raise your hands high,
I just wanna get a sense.

98
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:10,250
A lot, so to me one of the
things that's very devastating

99
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,375
and the difference of being
here today versus 10 years ago

100
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,750
is the people that
were here 10 years ago

101
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,041
were building products and
were trying to build products

102
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,291
and, or businesses,
one or the other.

103
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:24,458
The far majority of
startups in our ecosystem today

104
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,583
are building
financial arbitrage machines.

105
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,834
All they're doing is
trying to hit certain metrics

106
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:32,542
to raise the next round
of capital to keep going

107
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:35,083
until some sort
of imaginary exit.

108
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,625
And that's scary to me
because for anybody else here

109
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,041
who's following
the business world,

110
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,041
we've now lived through eight or

111
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:43,083
nine very good
years in our economy.

112
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,708
That plays
itself out eventually.

113
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,125
And when there is no more money

114
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,000
and you actually
have to run a business,

115
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,625
all those things you
cared about, like CAC and LTV

116
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,041
and all these other
lovely, important things

117
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,959
become far less important than

118
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,208
do you make more money
than you lose each month?

119
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,083
Let me just remind
everybody, you're not a

120
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:02,792
superstar entrepreneur when
you're losing money each month.

121
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:04,375
(audience laughter)

122
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,041
There's a lot of
interesting themes

123
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,250
that are in play
right now, and so

124
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,375
those are the things that
I like to pay attention to.

125
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,500
I reverse engineer
human behavior, and I deploy

126
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,750
my actions into places where
I think there's opportunity.

127
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,500
That's my thesis,
that's what I roll on,

128
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,834
and most of it's
very tried and true.

129
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:24,875
I love HR, I love people.

130
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,041
I love people's behavior,

131
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,834
and I love consumer trends.

132
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:31,250
This is the place
to be for that stuff.

133
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,708
Thanks for having me
and I'm ready

134
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,166
to answer questions,
whether very tactical of, like,

135
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:38,333
how to run a Snapchat
filter ad or philosophical

136
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,083
of, like, how do you tell your

137
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,333
mom that she's
ruining your life?

138
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,083
(audience laughter)

139
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,667
Cool, name and question.

140
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:50,417
- Steven Rosenberg.
My question is, so I watch you

141
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,000
go all over the country
and all over the world

142
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,458
and people ask
you the same questions--

143
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:54,875
- Yes.

144
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,000
- [Steven] over and
over and over,

145
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,625
I wanna add value and ask you,

146
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,166
what kind of questions
do you want people to ask?

147
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:03,375
You don't have to answer the
same question over and over.

148
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,458
- So Steve, this is literally
the question I hate the most.

149
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,417
(audience laughter)

150
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:09,417
- [Steven] Okay, really?

151
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:11,500
- I'm not even kidding.
- [Steven] Really?

152
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,041
- I'll explain in a minute.
- [Steven] Okay, yeah.

153
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,458
- Literally,
I would've preferred

154
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,542
you ask me the
same cliche question.

155
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,542
- [Steven]Really?
- Yes, I'll tell you why.

156
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:21,166
- When you're answering
people's questions,

157
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,792
you need to provide them
value, not yourself value.

158
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:24,625
- [Steven] Correct.

159
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,583
- Do you know why 98%
of the South-By keynotes

160
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,333
this year are gonna suck shit?

161
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,291
- [Steven] Because they're not--

162
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:32,333
- No, because they're
doing press releases for their

163
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,166
- [Steve] Right.
- best behavior,

164
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,083
not for the audiences.

165
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,625
The reason I'm doing a keynote,

166
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,667
a Q&amp;A session is I
wanna give you something.

167
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,625
I'm plenty
comfortable self-promoting

168
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,166
plenty of other times,

169
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,417
and so I don't have
any question.

170
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:46,917
Listen, there's nothing
I want to be asked.

171
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:49,083
All I want to do is give
people what their question is.

172
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't mind answering
the same question

173
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,166
over and over, you know why?

174
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:55,959
We have seven to 11 basic
themes that are fucking us up.

175
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:58,375
- [Steven] Right, so,
alright let me ask you this.

176
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,291
- Fine.
- [Steven] What do you think

177
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,000
of eco-capitalism
moving forward in 2017?

178
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,083
- I'm sorry one more time?

179
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,583
- [Steven] Eco-capitalism.

180
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,208
- Like, break it down for me.

181
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,583
Another great thing about Q&amp;A
is I try not to answer shit

182
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,375
I don't understand
- [Steven] Yeah so basically,

183
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,959
(audience laughter)
corporations being able

184
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,166
to profit from
their waste stream,

185
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,875
though its really wasteful,
and you have to pay for waste.

186
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,458
And they're using
social to change that.

187
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,250
- So, in that vein,
I don't know all the details,

188
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,625
but I'll go
thematically with you.

189
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,625
- [Steven] Please.
- Companies are very basic.

190
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,291
- [Steven] Okay.

191
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,458
- They never do good things

192
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,834
unless it's
good for the company.

193
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:29,667
- [Steven] Right.

194
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:32,000
- So, if there's a
way to incentivize,

195
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,834
it's like when people
are CEO's and they're mad

196
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:36,041
at their sales team
for selling the wrong shit,

197
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:39,291
but meanwhile the CEO's bonusing
them on that shit behavior,

198
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,458
I'm like, you're a shithead.

199
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,667
Change the
bonuses and they'll adapt.

200
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,834
You wanna fix the environment?

201
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:47,667
Make and incentivize
every company to do that,

202
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,333
they will do it
every single time.

203
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,458
- [Steven] Correct,
but it's hard for them

204
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,959
to get on board initially,

205
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:57,250
even though it
capitalistically makes sense,

206
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,708
for them to listen to
that, because they hear

207
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,792
environment and they go oh.

208
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:03,000
- Yeah, I would tell you
that I don't believe that,

209
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,458
and let me explain why.

210
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,542
I'm not sure who's
feeding them that information,

211
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:10,667
but I promise you every CFO
of every Fortune 5,000 company

212
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,250
in the world, unless they decide

213
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,542
to make it a political issue,
which I'm very empathetic to,

214
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:18,417
is going to always make
the dollar and cent decision.

215
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:19,708
- [Steven] Right, I mean doesn't

216
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,542
VaynerMedia
spend money on waste?

217
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:24,708
- Of course.
- [Steven] A lot.

218
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,041
- I don't know, to be frank.

219
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,000
- [Steven] I'm sure,
yeah, okay, thank you.

220
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,417
- You're welcome.

221
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:33,291
Me?

222
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,332
Seriously?

223
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:35,707
(audience laughter)

224
00:08:35,707 --> 00:08:36,832
That is literally the first time

225
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:38,541
I've ever fucking
heard that in my life.

226
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:39,707
Can you guys pump me up?

227
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:41,041
Got it, I'll go harder.

228
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,125
(audience laughter)

229
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,125
What's up my man?

230
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,458
- [Trevor] How are you Gary?

231
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,542
- What's your name?

232
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:48,291
- [Trevor] Trevor Williams, 
Austin, Texas.

233
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,125
- Love it.

234
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,333
- [Trevor] First off,
real quick, huge fan.

235
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,166
- Thank you.

236
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,083
- [Trevor] I'm limiting
myself on my goals,

237
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,083
and you kinda helped
me blast through those.

238
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:54,917
- Thank you.

239
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:56,542
- [Trevor] We have a
local company, IoVitamine,

240
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:59,250
we do IV hydration therapy,
great for hangovers by the way.

241
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,583
South-By a good time here.
- So the kind of shit where

242
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,041
you get drunk and
you go into a place

243
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:02,875
and they put an IV in you?

244
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,708
- [Trevor] Exactly.
- Okay.

245
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,166
- [Trevor] It's not just that
though, it's overall health,

246
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,500
fatigue, it's overall wellness.

247
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,333
- Okay.

248
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,917
- [Trevor] Great response,
new category,

249
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,250
the only one here in Austin.

250
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,083
There's only about a handful

251
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,458
of them across
the United States.

252
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,917
We're trying to raise awareness
of how it makes you feel,

253
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:18,583
how it helps you,
and we're overwhelmed.

254
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,500
We have four partners
that are working full-time,

255
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,750
we're trying to
scale it pretty quickly,

256
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,291
so we're doing all of the
standing operating procedures.

257
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,083
So how do we--
- You're trying to scale

258
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,208
quickly because
you feel like you

259
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,041
could be commoditized if
people open up other shops?

260
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,291
- [Trevor] Yeah, we
just want to be first.

261
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,792
It's a first to market play,
it's not really controllable.

262
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:35,291
- Not always, right?

263
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,667
It's first to market
play a lot of times on brand,

264
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:39,625
but not on locations, and
this is where a lot of people

265
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,125
get fucked up, they
overexpand and they lose,

266
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,542
Krispy Kreme, things of
that nature, it's iconic.

267
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,792
It's 80 years in the making.

268
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:47,041
People wanna move fast,

269
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,625
and they think their
advantage is locations.

270
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:52,333
It's actually brand,
and what a lot of people

271
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,625
end up doing is they go
tactical and try to open up

272
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,417
those locations instead
of worrying about the things

273
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:58,000
that will give them a marathon.

274
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,667
Because you're not running a
sprint, unless you're looking

275
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:02,625
to exit in the next 24 months
and sell off the company.

276
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,000
So your behavior
needs to map that.

277
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,667
It's just one thing to
keep in mind, but keep going.

278
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,000
- [Trevor] So
what's the best way,

279
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,583
we're overwhelmed
as it is, like...

280
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,875
- Hire people.

281
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,333
- [Trevor] Hiring people, okay.

282
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,667
So getting out there,
getting on social media--

283
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,041
- No, no, no.

284
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,792
Before you worry about
the tactics of marketing,

285
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:19,667
if you're truly overwhelmed,
then you started with that,

286
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:21,834
four of us were
running a mile a minute,

287
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,708
have you guys
thought about hiring people?

288
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:24,792
Like more people.

289
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,834
- [Trevor] We've started,
we hired a marketing person,

290
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:32,083
20-30 hours a week, gonna
help us reach out a little.

291
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,750
- Are you guys profitable?

292
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,792
- [Trevor] Yes.

293
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:36,834
- What are you
doing with the profit?

294
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:38,667
- [Trevor] Uh, paying bills.

295
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:39,500
- Right so--

296
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,708
- [Trevor] Catching up on debt.

297
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,125
- Got it, okay, understood.

298
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,834
Yeah I mean, look,
so are you looking

299
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:46,291
for a tactic or a thesis?

300
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,208
- [Trevor] I want a
tactic as far as how to deploy

301
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,750
the most to get out message
out there and create the brand.

302
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,917
- Well, there's three ways
to communicate to the world.

303
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:58,250
You can write content,
you can do audio content,

304
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,041
or you can do
video content, right?

305
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,500
Video content
historically is over indexed it,

306
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,417
and so you can make video
content and run it on Facebook,

307
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:10,583
and run ads for people
within the Austin zip code,

308
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,125
and build awareness that way.

309
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,083
The underpriced tactic in
the market for everybody here,

310
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,875
B2B, B2C,
startup, Fortune 50,

311
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:22,250
the underpriced
attention to the target

312
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,417
that you're looking for,
as we stand here today,

313
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,125
is Facebook video.

314
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,750
So you need to
figure out how to make that.

315
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,625
At first it could
be on your phone,

316
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,500
if you don't have the dollars.

317
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,083
Later it can get fancy
like DRock, but the reality is

318
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:37,959
that's not even really that
fancy, and so I think that,

319
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:41,291
sorry DRock and so,
(audience laughter

320
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,083
I think Facebook video

321
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,625
targeting people
of certain wealth

322
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,125
and interests that would
make sense for them to come

323
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:50,375
to you, is probably the tactic
you're most looking for,

324
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,208
and I would say
influencer marketing.

325
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:56,083
Instagram peeps with
300, 3,000, 30,000, 300,000,

326
00:11:56,083 --> 00:12:00,041
if they're, you know, exchanging
your service for them,

327
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,208
you know you give
it to them for free,

328
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,291
they're giving you
shout-outs, that's a really

329
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,375
grossly underpriced
awareness right now,

330
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,500
is influencer marketing
on an Instagram world.

331
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,291
And those would be the
two places I would focus on.

332
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,250
- [Trevor] Perfect, perfect.
A real quick jab,

333
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,333
it's gonna be a right hook
'cause of all the people here,

334
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,250
but we are mobile, if
any of you or your staff

335
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,792
want us to come to
you while you're in town,

336
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:18,917
we'll come hook you up.

337
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:20,542
Complete jab. And ah--

338
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:22,875
- That's a right hook,
it's not a jab.

339
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,208
- [Trevor] Of course, of course.

340
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,750
But I've been
DMing you as a jab only,

341
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,041
but since I'm
here it's a right hook.

342
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,291
- Dude, everybody's
fucking DMing me.

343
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,834
(audience laughter)

344
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:31,875
- [Trevor] Anyway,
thanks for everything you do,

345
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,375
I appreciate it man.
- Cool.

346
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,708
(audience applause)

347
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:36,834
Hey man.

348
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:39,792
- [Tony] Hey, Tony Bova
from Knoxville, Tennessee.

349
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:40,625
- Love it.

350
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,500
- [Tony] Two things I--
- Who's from Tennessee?

351
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,333
- [Tony] Ya, go Vols.
- Alright, there's three of you.

352
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,500
- [Tony] Well, maybe
next year there will be more.

353
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
- Better than zero.

354
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,333
- [Tony] Quick
comment to the first guy.

355
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,375
I think he's a little bit wrong.

356
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,375
We actually have a startup

357
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,542
where we're taking a waste
product from the paper industry

358
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,417
and making
biodegradable plastic out of it.

359
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:58,917
- Do you think you
two should fight?

360
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:00,208
- [Tony] Yeah, I do.
(audience laughter)

361
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,333
- Alright, flagpole 3 P.M.

362
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,917
- [Tony] They're super happy

363
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,166
because they don't have
anything to do with this--

364
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,792
- So you guys can work yourself
out on other people's time.

365
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:08,792
Let's move on.

366
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:10,792
- [Tony] So my
question is for you,

367
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,792
we're competing in
a commodity market--,

368
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,291
- Yes.

369
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,542
- [Tony] but we're
really interested in--

370
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:18,166
- By the way, real quick,
99.999% of businesses,

371
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,166
are competing in
a commodity market.

372
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,959
That's why I'm
obsessed with brand.

373
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,166
It's a differentiator.
Go ahead.

374
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,000
- [Tony] That's my question.

375
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,083
So how do we
competing against like

376
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,834
the DOW and BASF of
the world with plastic,

377
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:30,834
how do you build a brand--

378
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:31,959
- Who are you trying to reach?

379
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:33,750
The B2B decision maker?

380
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,917
- [Tony] Both, I want--
- And consumer?

381
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:37,417
- [Tony] I want the
B2B decision maker

382
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,458
and I want the
consumer to go to them

383
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,125
and say I want
this instead of that.

384
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,375
- And create the pressure
kind of like Intel inside.

385
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,667
Ya man, I mean it's
called fucking marketing, right?

386
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:46,750
Like, it's gonna
be very basic here.

387
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,625
I think that, you know one thing

388
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,166
I think a lot of
you should be doing,

389
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,834
especially if you're
in a B2B environment,

390
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,708
is starting a monthly podcast
where you become the experts,

391
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,000
as a media company in
your space and really.

392
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,250
I mean look this is
10 years ago, Wine Library TV.

393
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,291
I thought I was gonna
be QVC and just sell wine.

394
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,458
That's what I thought
I was gonna do.

395
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,959
The second the camera
went on I was like, shit,

396
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,333
this is recorded forever.
I need to rethink this.

397
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,458
And I just became America's
wine guy in that world.

398
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,458
I think that you should
start a monthly podcast,

399
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,667
or a weekly podcast
if you wanna hustle,

400
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:18,959
have really interesting guests,

401
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,625
and that small
little niche of people

402
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,083
that are interested in your
world will find yourself there.

403
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,083
The more you can act
like a media company,

404
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,500
and less like an advertiser,
you will always win.

405
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,458
'Cause nobody in here wants ads.

406
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,750
People want
content and the truth is

407
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,959
we actually don't give a shit
where the content comes from.

408
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,291
Whether it's a network, or a
producer, or an individual,

409
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,291
or a company, as
long as it's great.

410
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,917
The problem is, 99% of companies

411
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:42,333
want them to be
commercials not content.

412
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,625
So you could do that.

413
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,125
Or, you could take
the advice I said before,

414
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,125
the two underpriced
for early stage.

415
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:50,250
Like, when you're David and
you're playing against Goliath,

416
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,000
you have to do David tactics.

417
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,458
And our little slingshot
with a rock right now,

418
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,041
is Facebook ads.

419
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,166
You know, I know I'm
boring the shit out of the ones

420
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:01,041
that follow me, it's
just that when I stand up here

421
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,417
and say I built my dad's store
from three to 60 million,

422
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:06,041
I always feel that it
should have been 250 million,

423
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,291
because what I didn't
do was spend all my money

424
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,208
on Google AdWords in
2000, 2001, '02 and '03

425
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,250
when I had it
and I figured it out

426
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,041
and it was five
and ten cents a click,

427
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,625
but it was so
early and I was so young,

428
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,750
I didn't realize how

429
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,667
historically amazing
this would be.

430
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:24,291
We are paying 6 to 13 dollar
CPMs on Facebook right now

431
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,500
that are gonna be 50 to 80
dollars in 36 and 48 months,

432
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,834
and everybody that's
not here is gonna be sad

433
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:30,917
that they didn't jump on it.

434
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:32,000
And they're gonna
look back to this talk

435
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,750
and be like, fuck,
I shoulda listened to Gary.

436
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,500
(audience laughter)
- [Tony] Awesome.

437
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,834
- So those are the
two things I would do.

438
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:39,542
- [Tony] Thank you so much.
- Media company,

439
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:41,458
and become the
voice of the market,

440
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,250
and become the platform

441
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,208
that people talk
about the market on.

442
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,375
That brings
interest to decision makers

443
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,875
or market in the
place where people are

444
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,500
that's underpriced right now.

445
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,959
- [Tony] So just own it
as we're the experts--

446
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,417
- If you are.

447
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:56,375
Like one of the sad things
about the world we live in now,

448
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,041
is people are
claiming to be experts

449
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,875
when they're 21-years-old
out of school,

450
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,208
and they just want to be an
influence or an Instagram.

451
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,291
- [Tony] Right, awesome.

452
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,166
Thank you very much.
- Thank you, yeah.

453
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,542
(audience applause)

454
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:08,792
- [Russell] 'Sup Gary?
- How are you man?

455
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:09,708
- [Russell] My name's Russell.

456
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,208
- I'm aware. We played
basketball for two hours,

457
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,333
two hours ago.

458
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,417
- [Russell] Yeah,
so that was awesome.

459
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:16,208
Shoutout to Tyler, thanks Ty.

460
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,333
So my question today
is just, for the people,

461
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,041
like you get to hang
around cool ass people,

462
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,917
like Tony Robbins
and Adam Gerard,

463
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,250
and all those awesome people.

464
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,708
Is there anything that you
notice that they have in common

465
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,250
and that you really think that
makes them uberly successful?

466
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,041
And on the other
flip side of that,

467
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,750
is there anything
that you notice among,

468
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,333
not necessarily
failures in life,

469
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,667
but people who just fucked up,

470
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,708
excuse my language, but uh--

471
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,250
- Don't worry.

472
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,083
(loud audience laughter)

473
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,542
- [Russell] That really make
them kind of mess up in life.

474
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:47,250
- Yeah, I think, you know
it's a really great question.

475
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,708
It's really hard, and the
truth is we're all individual.

476
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:53,750
But I will say that I do believe
that people that care less

477
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,250
about what other
people think about them

478
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,750
tend to have a better life.

479
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,000
It's just liberating,
and the truth is,

480
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,291
you think it's the people
that troll you in comments,

481
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,500
I'm actually
talking about your parents.

482
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,750
And like, I genuinely
believe that self-esteem

483
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,040
is the ultimate drug in life.

484
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,000
That I'm obsessed with driving
self-esteem into my children,

485
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,750
my mom did that
for me, and listen,

486
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,290
there's a very fine line between
self-esteem and delusion.

487
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,000
Right, there's a very fine line.

488
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,415
But the reality is,
there are just so many people

489
00:17:26,415 --> 00:17:29,708
sitting here
that are broken inside

490
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,750
because they care
what their older brother

491
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,417
thinks about their behavior.

492
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:36,000
Or what their husband
thinks about their behavior.

493
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,750
Or what their mom
said to them growing up.

494
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,959
And I don't really
know how to break that.

495
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:44,333
What I'm trying to do
with my life is in parallel,

496
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,375
achieve what I want for me.

497
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,041
But the reason
I document so much,

498
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:52,291
is that I'm trying to become
the injection of audacity

499
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,583
into the people that watch me,

500
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,667
that gives them the
courage to take the jump

501
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:58,583
into the pool that
they're scared to swim in.

502
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,667
And so, people are
just being held back

503
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:02,291
by other people's opinions,

504
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,458
and that's deep stuff
that you can't really hack at.

505
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,500
I'm trying to play
my tiny little part.

506
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,542
But I would say
that's the differentiation.

507
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:12,625
Like, it's unbelievable
to me, I tweeted something

508
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:17,000
which was an inside tweet
without context for my company.

509
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,125
Which was,
"insecurity leads to politics".

510
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,500
The people at VaynerMedia 
that are so talented,

511
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,708
that are so about to
win, that I'm about to fire

512
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,959
because they're insecure

513
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:29,875
and that leads them
to terrible behavior.

514
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,875
It breaks my heart,
and we try hard.

515
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,208
My crews there,
they know, we try hard.

516
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,500
We pound at them, we
try to make them feel safe.

517
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,542
We have a Chief Heart Officer,
I do my thing.

518
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:40,542
We have a good culture, I try.

519
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:44,917
But insecurity is a killer.
It leads to all the bad shit.

520
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,291
And so it's the
difference between

521
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,041
self-confidence and insecurity,
it's the difference of like.

522
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,875
Listen being self-emotional
and putting yourself out there,

523
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,583
there's so many people
that have opinions about me.

524
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,834
As long as the
people that actually know me

525
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:58,291
have the opinions they have,

526
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,625
versus the people
that have never met me,

527
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,500
but they heard me
say fuck on stage.

528
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,125
Like, as long as
I'm good with the people

529
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,875
that actually can look under
the hood, then I'll always win.

530
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,417
So if you feel good
about who you actually are,

531
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:09,792
you need to get loud.

532
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:12,667
And if you don't, fix your shit.

533
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:13,667
- [Russell] Thanks Gary.
- You got it Russell.

534
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:15,875
(audience applause)

535
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,542
- [Justin] Hey Gary.
- How are you?

536
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:20,583
- I'm good man,
my name's Justin.

537
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,542
I really appreciate you
and the content you put out.

538
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:23,375
- Thank you.

539
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,667
- Now, you talk about hacking
culture. I'm really curious,--

540
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:27,834
- By the way the entire line
is a bunch of fucking dudes,

541
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,250
can I get some ladies up here?

542
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,083
(women in audience
cheer and applaud)

543
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,750
I see you darlin',
you're welcome.

544
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,333
Go ahead bro, sorry. Just a
fucking sausage fest, fuck.

545
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,875
(audience laughter)

546
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,458
- Sorry I'm adding to that.
How do you think about like,--

547
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,083
- Ladies, let's go.
Go ahead.

548
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,125
- How do you think about
tapping into the Zeitgeist,

549
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,375
specifically around
like content creation?

550
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,375
- Like, like hacking culture.

551
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,333
- Like hacking culture, ideas
that are going to spread now,

552
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,667
when is the right timing,
to make content around that?

553
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,417
- That's the magic,
let me tell you one thing,

554
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:54,542
all creatives in the room?
The creative is still

555
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:57,166
the variable of success.
With all the math

556
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,041
that has come into
our world and tech,

557
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,000
the creative is still
the variable of success.

558
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,083
(audience cheering)

559
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,667
Now, before we
get pumped creatives,

560
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:09,542
most creatives are dick
faces because they think

561
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,750
their opinion's better
than everybody else's because

562
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,583
AdAge one said they
said made something nice.

563
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:19,083
So it's this very
hardcore mix of actual humility

564
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,875
balanced with ego but
the underlining reason

565
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,917
that I've been able to do it
pretty consistently for myself

566
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:25,417
and the things I'm involved with

567
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:28,458
is it's all about listening.

568
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,750
It's all listening.
Like I talk so much

569
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,834
that people don't get it,

570
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:33,458
the only thing I'm
actually doing is listening.

571
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,041
The reason I'm so good with
my community to engage with

572
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,375
is because first I'm
listening to what you're saying,

573
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,250
and shit, I'm there, so
I might as well say what's up?

574
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,208
Right?

575
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,708
The reason I took
their selfie picture

576
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,291
and put it in my Instagram story
was, first, I was listening

577
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,500
and then I gave them daps,
like, I'm constantly listening

578
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,792
and for the people
that follow my vlog,

579
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,417
I don't do anything by accident.

580
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:58,041
I'm not spending all my
time with 30, 40 different

581
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:02,667
emerging Atlanta 19-year-old
hip-hop artists for my health.

582
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:05,417
I'm doing it because I believe
there's about to be a run

583
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:08,125
in that scene of
the Russes and the Nebus

584
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,375
and the things like
that, Skip and Flip,

585
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,625
like I think they'll be culture,

586
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,166
and I wanna have that
association. I wanna taste it.

587
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:17,041
Same reason I came here,
back in 2006, '07, and '08.

588
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,542
I thought that this
"Twitter", "Instagram" thing,

589
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:22,166
these people, were
gonna build the future.

590
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,000
I didn't give a
shit about technology.

591
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,208
I was like a very
weird guy here 10 years ago.

592
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,208
Everybody was like,
"We're gonna save the world,

593
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,083
"and we're gonna,

594
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,166
"we're gonna build products to
make people's lives better,"

595
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,458
and I'm like "yeah yeah yeah,"

596
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,959
but in my head I'm
like, "I'm gonna sell shit."

597
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:36,250
(audience laughter)

598
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,667
You know? And so,

599
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:41,291
what I do is just listen.

600
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:45,291
Even in politics, no matter
where I sit on issues,

601
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,834
I listen, nothing confuses
me of what's going on

602
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:50,667
because I listen. I know
the difference about what's

603
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:52,333
going on in my
Chattanooga, Tennessee office

604
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,708
versus my L.A. office.

605
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,041
I go into those forums.
I pay attention

606
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,166
to what's going on
on 4chan and Reddit

607
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,750
and other places that
people don't pay attention to.

608
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,208
I look, me and A.J.
started a sports agency

609
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,542
'cause I wanna know the
up-and-coming athletes

610
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:08,208
of the next generation
that are 16, 17 and 18.

611
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,708
I'm patient,
and I pay attention,

612
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,250
and I'm not scared to fail.

613
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,834
For every "Snapchat" and
"Instagram" that I've won on,

614
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,917
I lost on Socialcam, right?

615
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:18,333
I lost on Plurk.

616
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,208
Remember Plurk, 2009 here?

617
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,083
But I'm not
scared to do two things:

618
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,125
one, spend it on godly time,

619
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:28,083
listening versus thinking
I can manifest it myself,

620
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,917
and number two,
once I have a thought,

621
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,500
try things.

622
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,208
So for everything I get
credit for that I did well,

623
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:37,041
there's 18 things I didn't
do well that are forgotten

624
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:39,166
'cause it doesn't matter.

625
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,000
- [Justin] Yeah. Cool.

626
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,333
(audience laughter)

627
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,417
That was a good answer.
Thanks man.

628
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:46,959
- You're welcome.

629
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:50,750
- [Jared] Hey Gary, I'm super
pumped to be here.

630
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,625
- Thank you man.
- [Jared] Shout out to DRock.

631
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:54,750
I love all your stuff.

632
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,708
- What's your name?
- Jared, from Austin.

633
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,875
My wife is here and
she gets super pissed

634
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:02,208
when I go into my YouTube
shell and watch you and Casey

635
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,792
and all that.
- Understood.

636
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:05,792
My voice is annoying,
I know, sorry about that.

637
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:06,875
(audience laughter)

638
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,417
- I love it all, I just have,

639
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:12,041
I don't know the context of
this whole video but I saw it,

640
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:15,917
you were comparing TV
as dying just as radio has

641
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:17,250
already died.

642
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:17,917
- Right.

643
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:20,208
- [Jared] Working in radio
I can't believe that, right?

644
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:23,208
- So dying is a
very dangerous word.

645
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:25,333
Nothing dies, right?
Like radio's around,

646
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,250
newspapers are still here.

647
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,291
When I say dying
it's a slang term for,

648
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,375
I think the
advertising on that platform

649
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:34,291
is grossly overpriced
versus the alternative.

650
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:38,333
Meanwhile, I'm right
now spending a ton of time

651
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,625
on iHeartRadio Drive Time radio,

652
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,667
live reads by the disc jockey,

653
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:44,750
just because
I think that's underpriced.

654
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,291
So to me, I'm not a digitalist.

655
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,792
I'm just an attentionist.

656
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:49,625
So I just look at prices, right?

657
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:53,917
Outdoor media should not be up
12 to 15% in the last decade

658
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:56,000
in a world where everybody
here when they're a passenger

659
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,667
in the car is
looking at their phone

660
00:23:57,667 --> 00:23:59,458
versus out the window, so like,

661
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,959
that's just bad common sense.
The price is overpriced,

662
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:03,458
that's why I'm down on it,

663
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:06,917
but it's not like billboards
are being torn down, so,

664
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:08,500
a lot of times
especially with the way I roll,

665
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,000
things seem up, you know,
absolute, it's the nuances

666
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,125
underneath the
absolute statements that matter,

667
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:14,959
but keep going.

668
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,834
- [Jared] And so, from the
consumer standpoint,

669
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:18,875
filling that funnel,
are you a believer that

670
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:22,458
TV, radio still play a
role in filling from the top

671
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:23,792
and then obviously
Facebook ads--

672
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:25,125
- But I think
Facebook's much better

673
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:27,000
as a top of the funnel platform.

674
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,083
Because it's
massively underpriced.

675
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:31,667
Meanwhile, I think
a Super Bowl commercial

676
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:33,708
is the best deal in marketing.

677
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,208
Like, not even close.

678
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:38,250
At $6 million a pop, a steal.

679
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,166
On the Gary radar of pricing?

680
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:42,959
Worth $20, $30, $40 million.

681
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:46,625
Meanwhile, I think programmatic
digital banner buying

682
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:49,500
and preroll is the
worst shit on Earth.

683
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,375
Nobody gives a
fuck about your banner

684
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:52,583
and definitely not the pop-up

685
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:55,417
that's stopping you from
doing what you want. And yet,

686
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:58,208
the market of advertising,
Madison Avenue, loves it,

687
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:00,500
because they're
justifying the $5 CPM.

688
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,083
There's never been a time
when the value of something

689
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:05,417
was predicated on its price.

690
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:09,000
- [Jared] Alright, thank you.
- You got it.

691
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,667
(audience applause)

692
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:11,708
- [Julia] Alright.

693
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:13,875
- Alright, let's do this.
What's your name?

694
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:16,792
- [Julia] My name is
Julia and ten years ago,

695
00:25:16,792 --> 00:25:21,250
this man sent me my
wine for my wedding for free.

696
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,250
Seriously, he did.
- Don't tell them my secrets.

697
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,708
- [Julia] I know right? (laughs)

698
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:26,166
So, thank you.
- You're welcome.

699
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:28,792
- [Julia] I'm really glad I
get to say that in person.

700
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:30,959
So, ten years ago,

701
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:33,291
entrepreneurship was
not even on my radar.

702
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:34,500
And now I own a company.

703
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,834
Both my husband and I
run a financial planning firm

704
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:40,125
that we started to
help creative people

705
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:42,959
'cause lord knows we
need some help with our money.

706
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:45,333
And that being said,

707
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,166
we're using video a lot--
- Good.

708
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:49,125
- [Julia] Because
we're actually both actors.

709
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:49,959
- Yes.
- [Julia] Right?

710
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:53,959
And I'm hitting
this point of overwhelm

711
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:58,041
because my question is
how do you own a business

712
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:01,583
that uses video and social
media and keep your sanity?

713
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:05,542
I'm really an empathic person
and I feel all this pain

714
00:26:05,542 --> 00:26:08,667
and need around me
and it overwhelms me.

715
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:09,875
- Pain from the
people that are sending

716
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:11,000
these crazy emails?

717
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,500
- [Julia] Well, yes, sometimes,

718
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,125
like directly from the client.

719
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:17,500
It's just from the
social media world at large.

720
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,708
- Oh, you mean how
all of social right now

721
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,500
is just negative as fuck.

722
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,333
- [Julia] Yes!

723
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:25,041
I feel it's like
emotional dodge ball

724
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,834
and opinion dodge ball.

725
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:27,667
- Yes.

726
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:28,708
- [Julia] All these ideas.

727
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:31,083
How can I get in there
and try and help people?

728
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:34,375
- You stay on the offense of
positivity if you believe it.

729
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:37,250
You manage the amount
of time you spend looking

730
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,834
and rubbernecking at negativity.

731
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:39,667
- [Julia] How do you do that?

732
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:41,625
Do you have like time blocks?
- I don't give a fuck.

733
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,917
- [Julia] Okay, all right.
- I see all the negativity,

734
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:46,458
I just know that
life is like this.

735
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:50,166
I expect things to be difficult.

736
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:51,500
I want to remind everybody,

737
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,875
no matter where
you stand on politics

738
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:54,542
and things of
that nature, just data.

739
00:26:54,542 --> 00:26:56,959
This is the
greatest era to be alive.

740
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:59,208
As sad as you are
about certain things,

741
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:01,500
I promise you,
it'd be worse right now

742
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,875
if the Black Plague
was doing it's thing.

743
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:05,500
(audience laughter)

744
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,041
And so, I think we
get crippled, right?

745
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:08,500
You know, I think
a lot of people here

746
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,750
need to go an spend more
time with 80 and 90-year-olds

747
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,041
and ask them what
they lived through.

748
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:14,208
Nothing's perfect.

749
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:15,708
We're always gonna have it bad.

750
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:17,875
It's always
going to be something.

751
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:20,375
We've always picked on each
other for being different.

752
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,375
It sucks.

753
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:24,500
So if you're lucky, and
you don't have that in you,

754
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,834
I think you do
what I'm trying to do

755
00:27:25,834 --> 00:27:28,875
which is be completely,
utterly on the offense

756
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:30,875
of positivity
because if you're positive,

757
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:31,750
and you're happy,

758
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,750
and you're optimistic,
you owe it to each other

759
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,750
right now to get louder
because the only people

760
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,875
that are loud are the
people that are upset.

761
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:42,041
Right? Negativity is on
fire and happy people

762
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:44,417
are clamming up and
staying away from it.

763
00:27:44,417 --> 00:27:45,583
That's how we stay happy.

764
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:46,500
I went the other way.

765
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,792
I'm going right at it,

766
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,917
putting it out every single day.

767
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:52,708
That's number one,
but we're all wired different.

768
00:27:52,708 --> 00:27:55,542
I'm able to eat shit at scale
for the rest of my life.

769
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:56,583
That's why I'm a leader,

770
00:27:56,583 --> 00:27:57,417
that's why my company,

771
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:58,583
it's why I put myself out there.

772
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:01,083
If you get fatigued you need
to take yourself out there.

773
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:03,917
It's okay to not be there
every day, read every comment.

774
00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:06,375
- [Julia] I feel like if I'm
not out there all the time,

775
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:09,333
that I'm losing people
and undercutting myself.

776
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:11,041
- Yes, you are, but
what's more interesting?

777
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:13,083
Making $11 million a
year and being miserable or

778
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:15,291
makin $6 million a
year and being decently happy?

779
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:16,291
- [Julia] Thanks.
- You're welcome.

780
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:17,917
- That's it.

781
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:18,875
- [Julia] Alright, thank you.

782
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:20,291
- Well good, good to see you.

783
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:22,041
- [Julia] Get some
ladies up in here.

784
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:24,959
- They're coming.
They're mixed in.

785
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:28,583
- [Mark] 'Sup?
- Sup.

786
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:29,458
(audience laughter)

787
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,708
(Mark pops lips)
(Gary laughs)

788
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,834
(pops lips)

789
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:34,625
That was my question.

790
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:35,834
- Yeah what's your name?

791
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:36,667
- [Mark] Mark.

792
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:37,500
- Mark.

793
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,250
- [Mark] I saw you last
year, I was really inspired.

794
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,458
Told you about a
company that I started

795
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:43,375
one year ago called Wanderbrief.

796
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:45,458
We're a platform
where we connect freelancers

797
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:47,417
with companies
all over the world.

798
00:28:47,417 --> 00:28:50,041
People trade their
skills for experiences abroad.

799
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:50,792
- Understood.

800
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:52,542
- [Mark] And we've got a
lot of interest from people

801
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:53,959
and then not a lot of companies.

802
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:55,083
- Not a lot or a lot?

803
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,291
- [Mark] Not a lot of companies.

804
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:58,500
And then you said you
have to focus on the companies

805
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,583
like it's a
strip club and you need

806
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:02,041
to have the girls and
the guys will come, right?

807
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,083
- That's right.
- [Mark] This is the opposite.

808
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:05,583
We need girls here on the line.

809
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:07,542
But that strategy
actually worked really well

810
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:10,291
so we're now working for
a Adobe, Vodafone, Heineken

811
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:13,500
and Porsche, but I actually
have a question for you.

812
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,208
So if you could
work anywhere in the world,

813
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:17,792
where would you go?

814
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:18,792
- Nowhere.

815
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,625
- [Mark] Thank you.

816
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:23,542
- And the dude laughing
back there is clearly like,

817
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:25,708
it's never even crossed my mind.

818
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:26,917
It's never been there.

819
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:28,375
It's never gonna be there.

820
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:31,208
I don't want to work anywhere.

821
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:33,792
I just don't have
that ability in me to think

822
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:35,542
that somebody else is
going to steer my ship.

823
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:36,917
I'm just not interested.

824
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:39,250
And by the way,
I don't think that's cool.

825
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,500
I don't think I'm cool for that.

826
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,583
To be very frank,
I wish I didn't even have it.

827
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:47,166
You know how awesome it is to
be the number two or three?

828
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:48,750
You get almost all the benefits

829
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,458
and you get to blame somebody.

830
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:51,917
(audience laughter)

831
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:53,708
So the answer is I don't,

832
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,250
but I don't think
that's a badge of honor.

833
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,333
I don't think everybody,

834
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:57,250
right now everybody
thinks they need to be

835
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,875
an entrepreneur and a founder.

836
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:01,250
Meanwhile, I promise
you the following.

837
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:05,166
The number 11 at Facebook,
she made a lot more money

838
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:07,208
than everybody in
this room combined.

839
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,708
Right, we're not thinking smart.

840
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:10,208
This is back
to self-awareness.

841
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,375
You need to know who you are.

842
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:12,417
I know who I am.

843
00:30:12,417 --> 00:30:16,041
I am a leading CEO
entrepreneur, that's who I am.

844
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:17,250
It's always who I've been.

845
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,875
At 14, I was telling my dad

846
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:21,166
what we're supposed to
do in the liquor store.

847
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:24,083
So, my answer
to that is nowhere,

848
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:26,458
but I want to make sure
that everybody hears me loud

849
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,458
and clear, that
doesn't make it cool.

850
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:29,959
That just makes it my truth.

851
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:32,750
You just need to
figure out your truth.

852
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,917
- [Mark] Cool, so then
maybe you can give your spot

853
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,250
to number 11 of
VayenrMedia and I will take him

854
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,333
or her on a trip.

855
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:39,750
- Thanks for the right hook.

856
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,500
I'll look into it.

857
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,750
(audience laughter and applause)

858
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,792
- [Henry] Hey, what's up Gary?
How you doing?

859
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:45,792
- Super well man.

860
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:48,333
- [Henry] Good. I'm
Henry from Los Angeles.

861
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:51,333
I work for a company
called The Herbal Chef.

862
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:51,875
- Okay.

863
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:54,208
We do cannabis
infused fine dining.

864
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,208
- Awesome.
(audience laughter)

865
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:58,000
- [Henry] I do all
the social media stuff

866
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,875
with them and all that.

867
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:00,708
And I was wondering if
you see any similarities

868
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:03,041
in the cannabis
space and the wine space?

869
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:04,125
- Of course.

870
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:06,041
Wine was
illegal in this country.

871
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:08,875
Some of you saw my
South-By speech last year.

872
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:11,291
I hate this fucking state
because I can't ship wine here.

873
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:12,333
Right?

874
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,083
It's state by state regulated.

875
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:15,792
There's taboo.

876
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:19,667
80 years ago it was super
taboo to drink in this country.

877
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:21,834
20 years ago it was
super taboo to smoke weed.

878
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:24,625
It's getting chipped away at.

879
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:26,250
You know, obviously
the new administration's

880
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,458
got its agenda so it
may slow down the curve

881
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:30,125
of what we've got going on.

882
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:31,417
It will be
interesting to watch that

883
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:32,834
from an
entrepreneurial standpoint,

884
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:35,625
but I think we are now fully
on the other side of the hill

885
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:38,083
as a social issue
on that product

886
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,041
and I think it's really cool.

887
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:41,500
I'm excited to learn
about all the benefits

888
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,458
that have been
suppressed because people

889
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:45,041
have not wanted it to succeeded.

890
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:47,000
And so, sure, I will say this.

891
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,333
Like VR, I think
cannabis on the consumer level

892
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:53,083
at big scale is going to
be slower than people think.

893
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:53,667
- [Henry] Right.

894
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:55,708
- And I think it's also
going to be very competitive.

895
00:31:55,708 --> 00:31:57,000
I love looking at history.

896
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,291
The reason I know I'm right,

897
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,875
that we've gone to
a primary mobile world

898
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:03,959
and now the television
is the secondary device

899
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:05,875
just like we went through
with radio and television.

900
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:08,333
I think if you look
back at all the startups

901
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:10,875
that happen in
alcohol post prohibition,

902
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:13,041
99% of them failed.
- [Henry] Yeah.

903
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:15,166
- And so everybody's
gold rushing on this.

904
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,750
They don't realize how
slow it's going to take

905
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,500
and they're
building shitty businesses.

906
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,375
They just put the
word cannabis in it

907
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:22,208
and they think they're going
to succeed because it's coming.

908
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:23,417
- [Henry] Yeah.

909
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:27,917
Cool, do you see any mistakes
that you made with Wine Library?

910
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:29,875
- There's no parallels to
what I did with Wine Library

911
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:33,041
because it was a long, you know,

912
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:35,750
alcohol was legal
and for a long time.

913
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,959
I think the mistakes I made
with Wine Library are tried

914
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:41,291
and true to what I'm
talking about which is in 1996,

915
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:44,208
when I launched WineLibrary.com,
I thought in four years

916
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:46,792
everybody would be
buying wine on the internet.

917
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:49,166
Right, and it took the
internet much slower

918
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:51,333
to be an e-com platform.

919
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:53,041
Even now it's still
a smaller percentage

920
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:55,250
than most people realize,
so I would tell you

921
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,708
that innovators in this room,

922
00:32:57,708 --> 00:33:00,708
it tends to happen
slower than they think and

923
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:01,959
tends to happen faster than

924
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:03,667
all the people that
aren't here think.

925
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:05,375
It's finding that timing.

926
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:08,250
- [Henry] Great, thank you.
- Cool.

927
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,708
Hey, darlin'.

928
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:10,625
- [Connie] How you be?

929
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:11,834
- What up?
- [Connie] How are ya?

930
00:33:11,834 --> 00:33:12,667
- Super.

931
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:14,000
- [Connie] Good, good, good.
- What's your name?

932
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,375
- [Connie] So I
am Connie S. Falls.

933
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:16,959
I live in Atlanta,
so I probably see

934
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:18,750
all the great trap
rappers you're probably

935
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,583
dealing with these days.
- Yep.

936
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:22,917
- [Connie] So for me, for my
business, I have a government

937
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,917
contracting company
that deals primarily with the

938
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:26,792
Federal Government
doing construction.

939
00:33:26,792 --> 00:33:27,625
- Okay.

940
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:30,375
- [Connie] I have a podcast
that I do for entrepreneurs

941
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,250
where I do the interviews
and have those kind of

942
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,083
conversations that
are very transparent.

943
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,291
- Okay.
- [Connie] I have a T-shirt line

944
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:36,250
that deals primarily

945
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,500
with entrepreneurs.
- Okay.

946
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,417
- [Connie] Entrepreneurial Life
Is So Awesome.

947
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:42,583
And I have a
nonprofit that's in Nigeria

948
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:44,125
called We Are Global Champion.
- You're doing a lot of shit.

949
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:45,625
- [Connie] I'm
doing a lot of shit.

950
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:48,834
So my question is,
you do a lot of shit, too.

951
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:49,667
- Be careful.

952
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:52,834
- [Connie] How do you balance
your work and your life?

953
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:54,458
- Oh, we're talking
about work-life balance?

954
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:57,083
- [Connie] Yeah.
- Communication, the end.

955
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:58,750
Like, you just gotta
figure out who's in.

956
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,417
You know, again,
back to not giving a crap.

957
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:02,792
I'm not worried about
what everybody here thinks

958
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:05,917
about my work-life balance
or the way I parent my kids.

959
00:34:05,917 --> 00:34:08,083
I worry about what
my wife thinks and,

960
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:09,208
you know, and the inner circle.

961
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:10,333
The kids are
getting a little older,

962
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:13,458
I'm gonna start hearing
their feedback pretty soon.

963
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:17,166
And so I think that we
are crippling ourselves on

964
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:20,291
parenting and work-life balance
and we're judging ourselves

965
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,917
and we're all just trying to
do the best we can, right?

966
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:26,417
Like, this gold
standard is ridiculous

967
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:27,958
'cause it doesn't exist.

968
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:30,750
There's just whatever the
current politically correct

969
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,208
point of view is which
has historically been wrong

970
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:36,875
on almost every
social issue of all time.

971
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:39,250
So for me, by looking at that,

972
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,500
I'm just worried about
what's happening in my house,

973
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,000
so I don't give people whole
lot of advice on this issue

974
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,291
because your
relationship is different.

975
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,291
You know what
your relationships are.

976
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:52,125
And so I just try and
over-communicate, the end.

977
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:53,792
And some days it's
rolling for six months

978
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:54,708
and then it gets tough.

979
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:56,458
And like, we just try,

980
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:58,834
but it's hard to
suppress who you are.

981
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:01,333
Like, if you're hungry
and you're climbing,

982
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,250
it's tough to not
climb and be hungry.

983
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,375
And so you need to be
more selfish than you realize

984
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:09,417
'cause your happiness
is the starting point of

985
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:11,792
how it's going to
impact everybody around you.

986
00:35:11,792 --> 00:35:13,708
So you just talk
these things through.

987
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:15,917
- [Connie] Awesome. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

988
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:18,959
(audience applause)

989
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:20,542
- [Shawn] Gary, my name's Shawn.

990
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:21,917
- Shawn.
- [Shawn] It's a pleasure.

991
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:22,750
- Real pleasure.

992
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,667
- [Shawn] So let's say you're
the Jets owner right now.

993
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:26,417
- Okay.
- [Shawn] What would you do to

994
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:28,792
outbid the Broncos and
Texans to get Tony Romo?

995
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:29,834
- Nothing.

996
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:30,959
- [Shawn] Ugh!
(audience laughing)

997
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:31,875
- He's finished.

998
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:33,041
- [Shawn] The best
thing y'all got going is

999
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:34,458
Fireman Ed, the fan.

1000
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:35,792
- He's not doing
his thing anymore.

1001
00:35:35,792 --> 00:35:36,625
We lost him, too.

1002
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:38,291
- [Shawn] RIP.
(audience laughing)

1003
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:40,625
What role can we
expect virtual reality to play

1004
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:43,208
in our ability to enjoy
football when you're an owner?

1005
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:44,917
- Back to what
I was saying earlier,

1006
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:48,000
I think, ironically, it
probably will match up more when

1007
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,125
around the timing where
I have a shot to pull this off,

1008
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:54,375
so I think in 20 years it
could get really interesting.

1009
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:55,959
But I'll be honest with you.

1010
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:58,792
I'm spending very
little time, mental time,

1011
00:35:58,792 --> 00:36:01,917
in a world where
time is the asset on

1012
00:36:01,917 --> 00:36:04,250
consumer VR
because I just don't think

1013
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,750
it's as close as people think.

1014
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,875
I'm spending time
meeting a lot of people in it.

1015
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:10,834
I am looking at B2B VR
because I think a lot of money

1016
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:13,500
will be made in that as
Google and Apple and Amazon

1017
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,792
and those companies
buy up the talent

1018
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:17,792
and the platforms
and the apps that

1019
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,500
maybe can help
them build their play,

1020
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,917
but you know, yes, one day

1021
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:24,417
you can put on
your contact lenses

1022
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:25,708
and feel like
you're there, right?

1023
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:28,417
Like, it's really cool
to play Madden Football with

1024
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:30,250
contact lenses where
you're the quarterback

1025
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,291
and you see everything,

1026
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:33,959
but I just think it's much
further away than people think.

1027
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:36,000
If you said you're a
genie from the future

1028
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,500
and you said it's
six years from now,

1029
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,458
there's some traction.

1030
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:39,500
Yeah, okay, that
kind of makes sense.

1031
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,041
But like, just not next year,

1032
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:42,000
it's not the next year.

1033
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,166
And there's a lot
of shit to do between

1034
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:46,834
now and six years from
now that needs a lot of focus.

1035
00:36:46,834 --> 00:36:48,542
A lot of people
here are worried about VR

1036
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:50,000
while they haven't
figured out how to do a

1037
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,959
proper Facebook ad spend.

1038
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,750
(audience laughter)

1039
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,583
You like that one?

1040
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:55,667
That was good, right?

1041
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:57,208
So...

1042
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:59,583
Yeah, I just don't
get ahead of myself, man.

1043
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,875
One foot in front of the other.

1044
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:03,542
- [Shawn] Is that the Cap'n
Crunch dude on your shirt?

1045
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:04,708
- That's the Cap'n Crunch dude.

1046
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:06,208
- [Shawn] I dig it,
man, thank you.

1047
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:07,792
- It tears the
roof of your mouth.

1048
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:08,959
- [Shawn] It does, you
gotta be careful that...

1049
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:09,792
(audience laughing)

1050
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:14,166
It's the ultimate life
lessons in modern or...

1051
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:15,125
I went blank.

1052
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:16,083
- That's okay.

1053
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:16,959
We got your back, go ahead.

1054
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:17,792
We're sittin' here.

1055
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:18,625
- Thank you.
- It's the ultimate

1056
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:19,458
life lesson in?

1057
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:20,375
- [Shawn] Not overindulging!

1058
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:21,208
One goal at a time, man.
- Good one.

1059
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:22,792
Told you, it's support.

1060
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:23,625
All right, thanks, man.
- Thank you, Gary.

1061
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:25,375
- Let's move it.

1062
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:27,000
- [David] First off
I have to thank you.

1063
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,208
When I first
started following you

1064
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:29,375
I was a biochemistry major

1065
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:32,208
about to be in
academic probation,

1066
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,917
and that was 18
months ago. (chuckling)

1067
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:37,208
I have since
been going to the MSU

1068
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:39,708
Entrepreneurship Program
and have rebounded

1069
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:42,542
(mumbles)
have made a complete 180.

1070
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:44,291
- That makes me happy.

1071
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:45,166
- [David] My
question to you is--

1072
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:46,834
- What's your name?
- [David] David Well.

1073
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:47,917
- David, go ahead.

1074
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:50,375
- [David] Feel like I'm
about to pass out here.

1075
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:51,208
- No worries.

1076
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:53,834
DRock will catch ya.

1077
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:55,417
- [David] My question to you
is how do you feel about the

1078
00:37:55,417 --> 00:37:58,000
rise of entrepreneurship
programs in universities?

1079
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,250
- Concern.

1080
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,750
- [David] I came down here
with Michigan State University

1081
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,583
(audio cutting out)

1082
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:03,417
- Yep.

1083
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:06,000
- [David] Actually,
there's a whole lot.

1084
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,417
- Yep.

1085
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:08,417
- [David] Anyway,
how do you feel about

1086
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:10,041
the rise of seed funding for

1087
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:12,583
college entrepreneurs
at their university?

1088
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:15,291
- I'm concerned because
I think entrepreneurship

1089
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:19,125
has become a
rockstar status thing, right?

1090
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:22,417
If you told me 15 years
ago that a great young dude

1091
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:23,583
would stand in front of you
and say he's about to pass out

1092
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:25,125
just because
he's talking to you,

1093
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:27,041
I'd be like what the
fuck are you talking about?

1094
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:30,083
Right? Entrepreneurship has been
put on the current pedestal

1095
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:32,750
of rockstar status,
which is great for me

1096
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,333
and I'm pumped about it.

1097
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:35,875
But what it's doing
is it's making a lot

1098
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:38,959
of 15 to 22-year-old
impressionable kids

1099
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:40,542
think that
that's the only way out.

1100
00:38:40,542 --> 00:38:42,333
I'm gonna remind everybody
and this is a good segue

1101
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:43,667
David, and I
appreciate you bringing this up

1102
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:45,166
'cause it opened up the mind.

1103
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:48,000
My friends, we have lost.

1104
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,834
We have lost people that
have come to this conference

1105
00:38:50,834 --> 00:38:54,041
a decade ago, nine years ago,
eight years ago,

1106
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:56,375
to suicide,
because of the pressures

1107
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,000
of being
successful in our space.

1108
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,583
The hardcore startup
Silicon Valley pressure thing

1109
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,083
that doesn't hit everybody here.

1110
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:06,542
But we've created this
world where everybody wins

1111
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:10,625
and the truth is
barely anybody's winning.

1112
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:11,542
Everybody
thinks they're building

1113
00:39:11,542 --> 00:39:14,083
the next Snapchat, or Instagram.

1114
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:16,875
Those are one,
two, three companies

1115
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,291
that have made it happen.

1116
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:19,667
So I'm scared.

1117
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:21,458
I love it, because
I'm an entrepreneur

1118
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:22,792
and I live the
reverse of your life.

1119
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:25,583
I got D's and F's, was
emotionally sound as shit,

1120
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:28,166
making $4,000 a
weekend, was a good kid,

1121
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:29,542
and everybody
told me I was a loser

1122
00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:31,583
'cause I wasn't
gonna be good at academics.

1123
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:33,333
So I'm thrilled that
we're not just black and white

1124
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:36,291
from the 80's and 90's, where
school's the only way out,

1125
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:39,041
and shit, I wish I was
growing up in this era

1126
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:41,291
because I'd be
really doing my thing.

1127
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:44,792
At the same token I think the
pendulum has swung too far.

1128
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:46,959
Entrepreneurship is very lonely.

1129
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:48,542
It's all on your back.

1130
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:49,792
It's a ton of pressure.

1131
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:52,333
It's all on you,
there's nobody to point to.

1132
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:55,375
If you fail everybody you
know knows that you failed.

1133
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:56,667
That's a tough scarlet letter

1134
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:58,500
for the majority
of people in it.

1135
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,166
Especially if
they're not pure and bred.

1136
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:02,166
Do you know how
much I love failing?

1137
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,000
- [David] No.

1138
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,250
- I fucking love it.

1139
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,625
I love scarlet letters.

1140
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:08,166
I want not only the A,
I want fucking to Z.

1141
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:10,500
Because I'm a
purebred entrepreneur

1142
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,834
and losing is attractive
to purebred entrepreneurs.

1143
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:14,875
- [David] It's the
only way you learn.

1144
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:16,166
- Hundred percent.

1145
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:20,291
And it's the cost of
entry to the game.

1146
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:22,208
But now you have a
ton of people who aren't,

1147
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:23,583
and they were
good A and B students,

1148
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:26,083
or they'd be a great number
four or a great number 13,

1149
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:27,208
or a great project manager.

1150
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:28,041
Great!

1151
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:29,458
But they wanna be a number one.

1152
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:30,917
That's just a
totally different game.

1153
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:31,792
It's gray.

1154
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:33,291
Shit's gray.

1155
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:35,500
So I'm concerned
because we're funneling

1156
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,041
too many kids into it and
there will be a lot of pain

1157
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:40,875
that comes along with
that because right now

1158
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:43,333
I know a ton of 26 year
olds with their startup.

1159
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:45,208
They've never failed,
their grandfather

1160
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:47,875
was the naming rights
of the fucking library

1161
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:49,166
that they went to college with.

1162
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:50,625
They're like cruising

1163
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:52,750
but the market, the
funny thing about the market.

1164
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:57,417
In school, even in college,
even in a lot of jobs?

1165
00:40:57,417 --> 00:41:00,291
Your last name?
The family you came from?

1166
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,291
Money, can protect you.

1167
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:03,125
The market?

1168
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:06,625
You launch a product, the market
doesn't give a fuck, David.

1169
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:09,000
The market doesn't give a fuck
what your grandfather did.

1170
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,500
That's where
people are getting hurt

1171
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,000
and there's
gonna be a lot of pain

1172
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,208
in the next two, three, four
years whenever this melts.

1173
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:19,250
So I'm passionate to
make sure that we talk

1174
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,375
about self-awareness
and getting to know yourself

1175
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:22,208
and what you're good at.

1176
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:25,834
Not that entrepreneur
is the key to success.

1177
00:41:25,834 --> 00:41:27,375
Thanks.

1178
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:30,250
(audience applauding)

1179
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,458
- [Belky] Hey GaryVee.
- Hey.

1180
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:32,750
- [Belky] I'm Belky,
Austin, Texas.

1181
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,875
Between Snapchat
and Instagram stories,

1182
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:36,708
where are you
seeing more engagement?

1183
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:39,166
- I'm growing on
Instagram stories,

1184
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:41,375
but I think the
opportunity is in Snapchat

1185
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:44,625
because everybody got lazy
and is only doing Instagram.

1186
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:48,708
- [Belky] That's
all I really wanna know.

1187
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:52,458
- Yeah, I think
when you trade attention,

1188
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:54,917
my man, when
you trade attention,

1189
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:56,875
you love moments like this.

1190
00:41:56,875 --> 00:41:57,834
People are lazy.

1191
00:41:57,834 --> 00:42:00,417
They're like, "Oh! Instagram's
now got all the features.

1192
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:01,917
"I have more
followers on Instagram.

1193
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:03,458
"It's hard to build
followers on Snapchat.

1194
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:06,250
"I'll just chill here
and grow, this is better."

1195
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,083
Not realizing
that tomorrow Snapchat

1196
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:10,750
can drop a feature
that changes the game.

1197
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,500
They could. They may not.

1198
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,792
But I've been growing
quite a bit on Snapchat.

1199
00:42:15,792 --> 00:42:17,000
I'm growing faster on Instagram

1200
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,125
just because I became
somewhat viral in December

1201
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:21,625
on Instagram and my
worlds' changed there

1202
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:24,291
but I would tell you the
majority of the people here

1203
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,083
need to take a step
back and the answer is,

1204
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:30,041
if you're ambitious, and
you want things to happen,

1205
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:32,333
the answer is do both.

1206
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:35,667
Cool.
- [Belky] Thank you.

1207
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:38,083
- You got it.

1208
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:39,542
- [Daniel] What's up Gary?
Daniel from Houston.

1209
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:40,291
- Hey, Daniel.

1210
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,834
- [Daniel] Saw
you at the Super Bowl.

1211
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:42,667
- Appreciate it.

1212
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:43,500
- [Daniel] Crazy
that they kicked you out.

1213
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,625
- (laughing)
Yeah, that was crazy.

1214
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:46,166
- [Daniel] So I had a question.

1215
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:48,750
Going back to the David and
Goliath that you talked about.

1216
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,667
- Yeah.

1217
00:42:50,667 --> 00:42:52,959
- [Daniel] (inaudible)

1218
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:53,667
- Yep.

1219
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:56,667
- [Daniel] How do we
compete for creatives

1220
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:59,291
to bigger
companies when everyone wants

1221
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:01,458
to be freelance and
have their own business?

1222
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:03,333
And I'm asking this
question because I know

1223
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,083
that you truly care
about your employees

1224
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:05,834
and bringing value to them.

1225
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:06,417
- Yep.

1226
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,708
- [Daniel] But how do
we do that at a small scale

1227
00:43:07,708 --> 00:43:09,792
when we're very conscious
of our staff.

1228
00:43:09,792 --> 00:43:12,333
- Well, first, my creatives
are kids directly out of school

1229
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:14,750
that weren't getting
paid that much but I realized

1230
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,750
that creative talent
isn't based on how old you are.

1231
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,667
I don't
underestimate experience,

1232
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:22,417
but that would be like
thinking every NBA player

1233
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:24,375
at 35 is great
because of experience.

1234
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:25,583
There's pure talent.

1235
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:29,333
I think you should
focus on young, young people

1236
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:32,375
who do great creative work
because you can afford them

1237
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:35,834
and for them the
experience is worthwhile.

1238
00:43:35,834 --> 00:43:37,000
I think you get unemotional.

1239
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,708
I didn't give a shit
about who the cool creative.

1240
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:41,792
I can't name one
cool, creative director

1241
00:43:41,792 --> 00:43:46,083
in the agency world right now
let alone seven years ago.

1242
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:48,208
You're not competing for
fucking creative directors

1243
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:51,041
that are going to Droga5
and fucking Crispin Porter.

1244
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:51,750
- [Daniel] Right.

1245
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,375
- You're competing for
the kids that have the talent

1246
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:55,875
to one day do that, that
are growing up in H town.

1247
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:57,834
Go fucking find them.

1248
00:43:57,834 --> 00:43:58,959
- [Daniel] Alright, I'm
gonna go fuckin' find them.

1249
00:43:58,959 --> 00:44:02,250
- Good.(audience laughter)

1250
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:06,875
- [Joshua] Gary, good
to fucking be here finally.

1251
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:07,792
- Thank you brother.

1252
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:10,375
- [Joshua] Joshua,
long time fan,

1253
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:12,625
not here to read you
a fuckin' resume.

1254
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:13,625
- No worries.

1255
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:16,375
- [Joshua] Got a true
jab, jab, jab, maybe even

1256
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:18,542
fourth jab but maybe
with a right hook at the end.

1257
00:44:18,542 --> 00:44:19,792
- It always is.

1258
00:44:19,792 --> 00:44:22,959
- [Joshua] First off, 
hats off to the ladies,

1259
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:24,959
got a little girl at
home who I ditched out

1260
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,667
on to be here so.

1261
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:27,708
(audience laughter)

1262
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:31,291
- So you're clapping up for the
ladies while dissing a lady?

1263
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:32,458
- [Joshua] She's only two.

1264
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:33,542
(audience laughter)

1265
00:44:33,542 --> 00:44:34,291
- Go ahead, go ahead.

1266
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:35,458
- [Joshua] Hopefully,
I can keep grinding.

1267
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:38,834
So, first off was gonna
bring a painting for you,

1268
00:44:38,834 --> 00:44:41,083
I hit you up on
social earlier, no response.

1269
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:41,750
- Sorry.

1270
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,792
- [Joshua] No big deal but
didn't want to get

1271
00:44:42,792 --> 00:44:44,291
a canvas in here.
- Yep.

1272
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:46,750
- [Joshua] Second
off, if you, DRock, Tyler,

1273
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,250
anybody else wants to
get the best fucking workout

1274
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,959
you can get in
while you're here,

1275
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:53,458
full on MMA-style thing going on

1276
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:55,291
first thing tomorrow morning,

1277
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:56,458
not sure if you're
leaving tonight or not.

1278
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:58,125
- Leaving.

1279
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:01,708
- [Joshua] Last thing, another
venture we got going on,

1280
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:04,000
the best fucking cold brew
you'll have in your entire life,

1281
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,959
So you can give that
a little taste later.

1282
00:45:04,959 --> 00:45:07,125
- That'd be interesting, okay.

1283
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:10,125
- [Joshua] But I guess to
get to the real hook would be

1284
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:12,125
with all these
different things going on,

1285
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:13,542
and you kind of
already answered another

1286
00:45:13,542 --> 00:45:15,959
question earlier
with over-communicate,

1287
00:45:15,959 --> 00:45:17,959
really taking a lot
from what you're doing

1288
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:20,834
and employing a
Chief Heart Officer.

1289
00:45:20,834 --> 00:45:22,625
As you can tell, with
all these different little

1290
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:24,208
entrepreneurial
endeavors going on,

1291
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:26,500
really trying to
find that balance.

1292
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,208
- Sure.

1293
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:31,708
- [Joshua] And so what I'm
seeing is that there's less

1294
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:34,041
sales with all the
different endeavors,

1295
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:36,500
less money coming
in but more profits.

1296
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,125
- Okay.

1297
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:38,125
- [Joshua] So the
margins are increasing.

1298
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:38,917
- Yep.

1299
00:45:38,917 --> 00:45:41,208
- [Joshua] Right, so I think
it really becomes a question

1300
00:45:41,208 --> 00:45:45,208
of you know when you talk
about bringing on more people,

1301
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:47,917
that's an ideal but I don't
have the cash for that.

1302
00:45:47,917 --> 00:45:48,583
- Okay.

1303
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:51,333
- [Joshua] So it becomes this
sort of imbalance of is it

1304
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:54,834
cutting labor or is it
putting everybody onto sales?

1305
00:45:54,834 --> 00:45:58,166
- Listen, no business succeeds
long-term without driving

1306
00:45:58,166 --> 00:46:00,125
top line revenue.

1307
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:03,000
You can maximize your
margin for only so long.

1308
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,792
So, sales is the
oxygen of businesses.

1309
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:09,291
I'd also tell you that when
you're doing three businesses

1310
00:46:09,291 --> 00:46:11,041
equally you're
doing no businesses.

1311
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:12,458
When people say
I do a lot of things,

1312
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:13,708
I said be careful.

1313
00:46:13,708 --> 00:46:17,667
I run VaynerMedia, like
I'm the CEO of VaynerMedia,

1314
00:46:17,667 --> 00:46:18,875
that's what I do for a living.

1315
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:22,667
I have figured out through
DRock and a creative team to

1316
00:46:22,667 --> 00:46:24,708
create an
enormous amount of content.

1317
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:27,041
By the way, I want to remind
everybody I've been running

1318
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:30,417
VaynerMedia for six years,
it's been around for eight.

1319
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:33,000
I only started doing the content
two years ago and change

1320
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,458
when DRock
on spec did creative for me,

1321
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:38,417
I wasn't even
going out spend on it.

1322
00:46:38,417 --> 00:46:40,917
I've figured
out how to you know,

1323
00:46:40,917 --> 00:46:44,458
They GaryVee stuff is my
side hustle that I have very

1324
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:47,125
little to do with other
than just living my life and

1325
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:50,875
then it's produced for me.
So I've run two businesses in my

1326
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:54,041
life every day
of my life continuously

1327
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:56,458
since I was 22-years-old
the first day out of college.

1328
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:58,083
So when I say be careful,

1329
00:46:58,083 --> 00:47:00,125
it may seem like I'm
doing a lot of stuff,

1330
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:03,291
mainly 'cause I'm working 18
hours a day and because

1331
00:47:03,291 --> 00:47:05,041
I'm efficient as fuck
and I'm doing a lot of

1332
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:06,583
eight-minute meetings,
13-minute meetings,

1333
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:08,792
19-minute meetings while you
make them an hour and a half

1334
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:13,250
lunch but I'm not
running three businesses.

1335
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:15,834
- [Joshua] Right, so that
really is that working 20 hours

1336
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:16,667
instead of being--

1337
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,208
- No, that's not,
that's not for everybody.

1338
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:20,708
- [Joshua] But I'm
saying, so if you have somebody

1339
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:22,041
such as myself
saying that is for me.

1340
00:47:22,041 --> 00:47:24,667
- You can't run three
businesses at the same time.

1341
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:25,917
- [Joshua] Right.
That's what I'm telling you.

1342
00:47:25,917 --> 00:47:28,083
- [Joshua] Right.
- Cool.

1343
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:30,750
Period.
(audience laughter)

1344
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,041
- [Joshua] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1345
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:33,417
- [Joshua] Do I give
my card to you or to

1346
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:34,250
DRock standing here?

1347
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,291
- DRock's right behind you.

1348
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:35,959
- [Joshua] Alright,
get you some cold brew.

1349
00:47:35,959 --> 00:47:38,166
- Thank you man, next.

1350
00:47:39,917 --> 00:47:41,208
- [Shahim] Hey Gary, what's up?

1351
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:42,667
- 'Sup?

1352
00:47:42,667 --> 00:47:43,834
- [Shahim] Shahim from Austin.

1353
00:47:43,834 --> 00:47:46,375
- Pleasure.
- [Shahim] Good to see you.

1354
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:50,333
For those of us who are getting
ready to start our monthly

1355
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:53,583
podcast but are
feeling resistant about it,--

1356
00:47:53,583 --> 00:47:54,708
- Because?

1357
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:56,458
They're worried about what
other people think about it?

1358
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:57,542
- [Shahim] I think
that's part of it.

1359
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:58,959
- What's the other part?

1360
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,291
- [Shahim] I don't know, I'm
curious on how else we can

1361
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:03,792
bust through other than wanting
the pain and wanting the

1362
00:48:03,792 --> 00:48:06,708
scarlet letters you know?

1363
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:09,291
- Dude it's
only scarlet letters.

1364
00:48:09,291 --> 00:48:11,625
Like, you don't
bust through on day one.

1365
00:48:13,959 --> 00:48:16,208
If you do not love the
process of what you're up to,

1366
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:18,500
you've already lost.

1367
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,625
It's true.

1368
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:21,083
This shit's hard.

1369
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:22,083
Like, what you do want?

1370
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:23,375
You want your first
fucking podcast to be number

1371
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:25,041
one on fucking iTunes?

1372
00:48:25,041 --> 00:48:27,291
Who the fuck are you?
(audience laughter)

1373
00:48:27,291 --> 00:48:29,291
I mean that's the part,
you have to love it.

1374
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:31,291
I love when people shit on me.

1375
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:33,250
I love when I showed up to
the tech world they're like,

1376
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,708
the wine guy thinks
he's gonna win this thing?

1377
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:37,875
Yep, you know I love
going to Madison Avenue

1378
00:48:37,875 --> 00:48:39,500
and being like, this Twitter,

1379
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:43,166
Business Week said Twitter
boy tries to start an agency.

1380
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:45,250
I said fuck yes.

1381
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:48,375
I'm about to do this
TV show right, on Apple.

1382
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:49,500
Planet of the Apps.

1383
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,041
Re/code rights,

1384
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:53,458
Planet of the Apps has
four celebrity mentors.

1385
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:58,875
Gwyneth Paltrow, will.i.am.,
Jessica Alba, and others.

1386
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:02,166
(audience laughter)

1387
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:06,333
When I tell you that article
made me so fucking happy,

1388
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:08,500
you've gotta
love the process man.

1389
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,166
Like, you're gonna break
through if you're good enough,

1390
00:49:10,166 --> 00:49:12,792
and you won't break
through if your show is shit.

1391
00:49:12,792 --> 00:49:14,208
But you've gotta
try to figure out

1392
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:16,583
if you're shit or awesome.

1393
00:49:16,583 --> 00:49:17,583
- [Shahim] Do you
feel like you have to be

1394
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:19,417
an entertainer or personality?

1395
00:49:19,417 --> 00:49:21,333
- I think people
have to listen to it.

1396
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,500
You either have to be massively
entertaining or really

1397
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:27,375
know what the fuck
you're talking about.

1398
00:49:27,375 --> 00:49:29,041
And when you have both.

1399
00:49:29,041 --> 00:49:32,291
(audience laughter)

1400
00:49:35,959 --> 00:49:36,834
You know what I mean?

1401
00:49:36,834 --> 00:49:40,208
But there's plenty not massively
charismatic over-the-top

1402
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:42,917
assassins in what they do
because they fucking know their

1403
00:49:42,917 --> 00:49:45,500
craft and they say it
their way and by the way,

1404
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,000
maybe they are better off in,

1405
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I'm obsessed with
getting everybody to understand,

1406
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,667
you have to find your medium.

1407
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:51,834
Maybe you're a great writer,

1408
00:49:51,834 --> 00:49:53,375
maybe you're
great at podcasting,

1409
00:49:53,375 --> 00:49:54,500
maybe you're in video.

1410
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,208
Maybe you cartoon it up like
Hugh McCloud who dominated this

1411
00:49:57,208 --> 00:49:59,125
scene of the early
days of South-By.

1412
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:00,792
You've gotta find a way you
communicate if you want to

1413
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:02,125
communicate to the world.

1414
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:05,250
Don't do podcasting
just 'cause its trendy.

1415
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:06,166
Got it?
- [Shahim] Got it.

1416
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:08,500
- Good luck man.

1417
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,000
- My man?

1418
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:11,917
- [Thomas] Hey Gary.
- Hey.

1419
00:50:11,917 --> 00:50:14,208
- [Thomas] So, I flew in
from Norway to say hi,

1420
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:15,208
I'm Thomas from
United Influencers

1421
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:16,625
- Awesome

1422
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:18,583
- [Thomas] First
international guy, I think.

1423
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:19,875
- Yep

1424
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:21,834
- Two part question.

1425
00:50:21,834 --> 00:50:23,583
Why do you think
influencer marketing has

1426
00:50:23,583 --> 00:50:26,333
grown so fast the last years?

1427
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:28,500
And what was the tipping point?

1428
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,500
- I mean influencer marketing
has always been around.

1429
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,041
Right?
- [Thomas] Yes, I agree.

1430
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:33,125
- It's been product placement.

1431
00:50:33,125 --> 00:50:36,375
I mean John Wayne
smoked Lucky Strikes, right?

1432
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:38,166
This has been around forever.

1433
00:50:38,166 --> 00:50:39,792
I think the
reason it's exploded is

1434
00:50:39,792 --> 00:50:42,542
because we've become
a primary mobile world

1435
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:44,583
and instead of
watching Seinfeld,

1436
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,875
we're fucking watching
Logan Paul on Instagram.

1437
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:48,125
It's not super complicated.

1438
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:49,625
It's just where
the attention is.

1439
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:51,041
What's cool though is

1440
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:53,750
that the platforms
are the full distribution

1441
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:57,083
and the individuals
don't need middle men and women

1442
00:50:57,083 --> 00:50:58,583
to get them direct to consumers.

1443
00:50:58,583 --> 00:51:02,875
So the dollars that used to
go for interrupting a TV show

1444
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:05,417
and go to the platform is
now going to the individual

1445
00:51:05,417 --> 00:51:09,959
because they are the absolute
content and the distribution.

1446
00:51:09,959 --> 00:51:11,000
- [Thomas] Cool.

1447
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,917
And then the second part is

1448
00:51:12,917 --> 00:51:15,041
have Vayner
started experimenting with

1449
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:19,083
amplifying influencer
content with paid Facebook Ads

1450
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:21,542
and what's your
experience with that?

1451
00:51:21,542 --> 00:51:25,250
- Yes, we will
always amplify anything.

1452
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,792
Even if I get the
greatest celebrity of all time

1453
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:29,291
to promote this cupcake,

1454
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:32,083
if I think Facebook Ads
are grossly underpriced

1455
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:34,500
I will try to convince
my client to amplify it

1456
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,125
because we're trading
underpriced attention.

1457
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:38,792
- [Thomas] Cool.
- You know what blows my mind?

1458
00:51:38,792 --> 00:51:40,917
We do a piece of video content,
it explodes on Facebook,

1459
00:51:40,917 --> 00:51:42,417
and then my client
wants us to cut it down

1460
00:51:42,417 --> 00:51:44,542
to a 30 second spot
and make it a TV spot

1461
00:51:44,542 --> 00:51:46,959
and then overpay
for distribution.

1462
00:51:46,959 --> 00:51:48,500
Everybody's in a TV mentality,

1463
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,166
they think you graduate to TV.

1464
00:51:50,166 --> 00:51:52,083
I shit on TV commercials.

1465
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:53,583
(audience laughter)
- [Thomas] Cool, thanks Gary.

1466
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:54,667
- You got it.

1467
00:51:54,667 --> 00:51:56,625
(audience laughter and applause)

1468
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:57,708
- [Raja] What's up Gary?

1469
00:51:57,708 --> 00:51:58,708
- Life is good my man.

1470
00:51:58,708 --> 00:51:59,542
- [Raja] My name is Raja.

1471
00:51:59,542 --> 00:52:01,417
I'm a firm
believer in opportunities.

1472
00:52:01,417 --> 00:52:03,583
I just drove from Dallas,
three hours away,

1473
00:52:03,583 --> 00:52:05,708
so I really
wanna shake your hand.

1474
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:06,542
- Sure.

1475
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:15,208
Okay.

1476
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:18,834
- [Raja] So Gary, when do
you know the transition

1477
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:21,875
from going from
defense to offense?

1478
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:24,792
- I don't know.
I try not to be on defense.

1479
00:52:24,792 --> 00:52:28,000
Look, I think you
should always be on offense.

1480
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,500
Offense is always
the best defense, right?

1481
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,250
Like, I always say to people
I mentor or my companies

1482
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:38,208
I'd rather win a
basketball game 157 to 152.

1483
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:39,542
Right like offense always,

1484
00:52:39,542 --> 00:52:41,041
back to the top line revenue

1485
00:52:41,041 --> 00:52:42,333
for the guy who
had three businesses.

1486
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:44,291
Offense always solves problems

1487
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:47,250
as long as your defense
is not a complete disaster.

1488
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:50,333
So I just think offense
is a very good mentality

1489
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:54,250
and obviously it's a very
clouds question, very up here.

1490
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,917
We've all got very
different issues and that

1491
00:52:55,917 --> 00:52:57,542
but there is a trigger mindset,

1492
00:52:57,542 --> 00:52:59,458
I'm always trying
to stay on offense.

1493
00:52:59,458 --> 00:53:00,500
- [Raja] Beautiful man.
Thank you so much

1494
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,583
- You got it.

1495
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:03,708
- [Jeremy] Hey, what's up?

1496
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:05,750
I'm Jeremy from
Salt Lake City, Utah.

1497
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:06,583
- How are you?

1498
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:07,917
- [Jeremy] Doing good.

1499
00:53:07,917 --> 00:53:10,125
So I started a small
social agency in college

1500
00:53:10,125 --> 00:53:12,583
so I know the power
of Facebook ads in

1501
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:13,500
social listening and 
influencer marketing.

1502
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,166
- Okay.

1503
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:15,917
- [Jeremy] And I'm now
at a global agency

1504
00:53:15,917 --> 00:53:18,000
and I have a startup
on the side in retail.

1505
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,625
- Okay.

1506
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:19,208
- [Jeremy] I just wanted to get

1507
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:21,250
your opinion on
the space of what,

1508
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:24,208
number one, what's the
most disruptive piece of work

1509
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:26,708
you've seen in the last year?

1510
00:53:26,708 --> 00:53:28,667
- What does disruptive mean?

1511
00:53:28,667 --> 00:53:30,083
- [Jeremy] Stands out,
caught your attention,

1512
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:33,250
was extremely successful,
really broke the norm.

1513
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:37,417
- Yeah, I don't really,
you know I don't really know.

1514
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:39,208
I'm jumping in 'cause
I really can't answer you

1515
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:42,458
because I don't
think in advertising lingo.

1516
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:44,959
Like, there was no video on...

1517
00:53:44,959 --> 00:53:48,250
You know there was that
PSA about gun control right,

1518
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,959
where you couldn't see
the guy in the background

1519
00:53:50,959 --> 00:53:52,417
and it was him the whole time.

1520
00:53:52,417 --> 00:53:55,125
That was neat and interesting
and well thought through.

1521
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:58,375
There's work but I spend zero
time looking at creative work

1522
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:00,667
I spend all my time
on what people are doing

1523
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:02,583
so I never know how
to answer that question

1524
00:54:02,583 --> 00:54:05,542
because I'm not consuming shit.

1525
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:06,458
- [Jeremy] So the next question

1526
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:08,333
and flipping that
on it's head I guess.

1527
00:54:08,333 --> 00:54:10,000
What's the most
disruptive thing you see coming

1528
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,291
for the advertising industry?

1529
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:12,458
You already mentioned Facebook

1530
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:13,583
and influencers and what not

1531
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,708
but besides that?
- You know bro

1532
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:15,625
What's your name
again? I apologize.

1533
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:16,458
- [Jeremy] Jeremy.

1534
00:54:16,458 --> 00:54:19,458
- Jeremy, truth is man.
I'm not Nostradamus right?

1535
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:21,583
I don't know.

1536
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:24,708
What I'm really good at is
reacting when I see something

1537
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:26,667
so I don't know what
the next disruptive thing is

1538
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:29,458
but I know that I'm spending
a lot of time on Marco Polo,

1539
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:33,792
and After School and
Anchor and House Party

1540
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:36,166
and trying to figure
out are these the next

1541
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:38,250
Snapchats and Instagrams.

1542
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:41,583
So it's not about me knowing
it's me doing the behavior

1543
00:54:41,583 --> 00:54:43,500
and downloading
and playing with things

1544
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,792
when they have even the hint
of the potential to be it.

1545
00:54:46,792 --> 00:54:48,083
- [Jeremy] So how do you
see that potential

1546
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:50,083
or the hint of the potential?
Just user base?

1547
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:53,333
- Yeah, is there a lot of
attention gonna be somewhere,

1548
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:55,792
where then I have to figure out
the context of that platform

1549
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,500
so I can be a creative on it,

1550
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,834
to drive
whatever the hell I want,

1551
00:54:58,834 --> 00:55:00,417
whether that's
getting donations for a cause

1552
00:55:00,417 --> 00:55:02,542
or selling sneakers.

1553
00:55:02,542 --> 00:55:04,166
- [Jeremy] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1554
00:55:06,917 --> 00:55:08,250
- [Korom] This so weird.

1555
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:10,625
This is so weird.

1556
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:11,458
What's going on Gary?

1557
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:12,458
My name is Korom Julio,

1558
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:16,041
I'ma get a little bit
personal right now with myself.

1559
00:55:16,041 --> 00:55:17,500
At the age of 12 years old,

1560
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,458
I began selling iPads and
electronics left and right.

1561
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:22,083
I slowly moved up from there.

1562
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:24,208
I used to come home at 3:00,
4:00 AM telling my dad,

1563
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:25,291
"Take me to QuikTrip."

1564
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:27,250
Would come home
with 20 sealed iPads,

1565
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:29,166
and flip them the next day.

1566
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:30,667
I gradually went up to cars,

1567
00:55:30,667 --> 00:55:32,375
and then now I'm
doing real estate.

1568
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:33,834
And my birthday
was two days ago,

1569
00:55:33,834 --> 00:55:35,083
so I just turned 20.

1570
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:37,333
And why I'm
telling you all of this

1571
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:40,959
is because I am extremely,
extremely confused in life.

1572
00:55:40,959 --> 00:55:41,750
- [Gary] Okay.

1573
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,291
- [Korom] I do public
speaking here and there,

1574
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:44,500
people invite me to speak.

1575
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,834
I'm in school full
time taking 19 hours.

1576
00:55:46,834 --> 00:55:49,166
I do real estate,
and I am making money.

1577
00:55:49,166 --> 00:55:51,708
But I don't see any
business coming to me,

1578
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:53,125
I don't see
something that I love,

1579
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:54,625
and I'm trying everything,

1580
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:55,875
but just nothing
is clicking with me.

1581
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:56,834
- [Gary] So let's
take a step back.

1582
00:55:56,834 --> 00:55:58,000
First and foremost bro.

1583
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,291
You're a salesman, right?

1584
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:02,083
Like, it was in you.
Just like it was in me.

1585
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:03,959
Good thing about
being a salesperson,

1586
00:56:03,959 --> 00:56:07,333
is it's a skill that
always plays out, right?

1587
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:11,166
The other thing is, you're 20,
and you're lacking patience.

1588
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:14,000
You don't need it to
come right this second.

1589
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,750
If I give you a
good piece of advice,

1590
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:17,208
and you know this if
you're follow my stuff.

1591
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:18,583
I'm obsessed with patience.

1592
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:19,208
- [Korom] Yeah.

1593
00:56:19,208 --> 00:56:21,917
- You don't have to have
your eureka moment right now.

1594
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:24,959
You need to realize,
you're a salesperson.

1595
00:56:24,959 --> 00:56:26,583
That's clearly
what you are based

1596
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:27,959
on the narrative
you just painted.

1597
00:56:27,959 --> 00:56:30,000
And, what you should be doing,

1598
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,291
is tasting a lot
of different things.

1599
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:34,417
Putting yourself
in different rooms,

1600
00:56:34,417 --> 00:56:37,375
different networks,
consuming different content.

1601
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,333
You need to figure
out what floats your boat,

1602
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:42,959
but by the way, it may
just be the game of sales.

1603
00:56:42,959 --> 00:56:45,041
And it may not
matter what the product is.

1604
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:46,375
And that would be okay as well.

1605
00:56:46,375 --> 00:56:48,500
But you don't have to
"figure out" what your monster

1606
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,041
business is right this second.

1607
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:52,750
And you have to be thankful,

1608
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:55,542
for having, clearly,
really strong sales skills.

1609
00:56:55,542 --> 00:56:57,000
Because it is a survival tactic

1610
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,708
that will always work for you.

1611
00:56:58,708 --> 00:56:59,708
- [Korom] Gotcha. 
So you're saying

1612
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,000
just keep doing what I'm doing

1613
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,583
and hopefully
something comes up?

1614
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:04,125
- Keep doing what you're doing
and be on the offensive.

1615
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:06,667
Try and learn new
things in the world:

1616
00:57:06,667 --> 00:57:09,500
cooking, fucking tires,
like I'm serious.

1617
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,333
Yoga, meditation, like
just keep putting yourself

1618
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:15,500
out there, because
something might grab your heart.

1619
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,208
- [Korom] Gotcha. I kind
of got jealous of him,

1620
00:57:17,208 --> 00:57:19,083
can I get a hug as well?

1621
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:22,959
- Sure.
(audience laughter)

1622
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:28,125
All right.

1623
00:57:28,125 --> 00:57:29,875
Dude is that a flip cam?

1624
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:31,667
Oh no, it was your
phone, okay. I got scared.

1625
00:57:31,667 --> 00:57:33,417
I got excited, it's like retro.

1626
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:34,208
All right.

1627
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:36,041
- [Man 3] Good afternoon Gary.
- How are you?

1628
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:36,834
- [Man 3] I'm doing great,
and yourself?

1629
00:57:36,834 --> 00:57:37,667
- Good.

1630
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:39,708
- I'm here on behalf of
Marine Corps Recruiting.

1631
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:40,708
- Amazing.

1632
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:42,208
DRock's interested.
(audience laughter)

1633
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,917
I'm kidding 
I'm kidding, go ahead.

1634
00:57:44,917 --> 00:57:46,875
- [Man 3] I have a friend,
Staff Sergeant Jeremy Reese.

1635
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:50,166
He's out recruiting out in
Seattle, Washington right now.

1636
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:53,166
He is a protege of mine,
he is a disciple of yours.

1637
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:54,375
He follows everything you do.

1638
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:55,208
- Okay.

1639
00:57:55,208 --> 00:57:56,041
- He asked me to
ask you this question.

1640
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:58,708
He started his own vlog,
video blog, on fitness,

1641
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:00,000
and empowering people.

1642
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,708
What's one piece of advice,
if any, that you could give him?

1643
00:58:03,708 --> 00:58:04,667
- I mean there's so many,

1644
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:07,083
but I would tell him
that too many people think

1645
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:09,583
they're influencers
before they actually are.

1646
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:10,959
And I would tell
him to put his head down

1647
00:58:10,959 --> 00:58:12,917
and put out good content.

1648
00:58:12,917 --> 00:58:14,875
And just be patient.

1649
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:16,250
That's it.

1650
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:17,083
- [Man 3] Okay.
- Cool.

1651
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:17,750
- [Man 3] Thank you,
I appreciate it Gary.

1652
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:18,792
- You're welcome.

1653
00:58:18,792 --> 00:58:20,625
We may be able
to sneak one or two more,

1654
00:58:20,625 --> 00:58:21,792
I think they're
pretty hardcore here.

1655
00:58:21,792 --> 00:58:23,792
So, I apologize
for anyone in line.

1656
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:25,250
Let's go quickly.

1657
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:28,500
Hi.

1658
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,166
- [Nat] Hi, sorry.
- No worries.

1659
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:31,708
- Hi, my name is Nat.

1660
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,875
I'm from Sydney, Australia.

1661
00:58:36,291 --> 00:58:37,708
I have so many
questions for you,

1662
00:58:37,708 --> 00:58:42,375
but I guess I wanna
ask how do you quantify

1663
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:44,583
your values or your
strengths as a person,

1664
00:58:44,583 --> 00:58:46,583
in order to stand out?

1665
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:48,917
For example, when
there's so much competition,

1666
00:58:48,917 --> 00:58:52,000
and so many people that
are brilliant at everything,

1667
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,500
and it seems to be
whoever shouts the loudest,

1668
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,750
or whoever has the best
relationships, how do you--

1669
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:57,917
- That's just not true.

1670
00:58:57,917 --> 00:58:58,500
- [Nat] Okay.

1671
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,333
- The loudest, and best
relationships never win.

1672
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:04,041
It's just what people
that aren't winning think.

1673
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:06,708
It's the people that
are the best that win.

1674
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:09,041
- [Nat] How do you prove--

1675
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:12,375
- The market proves it
for you, so lets go in detail.

1676
00:59:12,375 --> 00:59:15,834
Like TechCrunch doesn't
pick the winners, right?

1677
00:59:15,834 --> 00:59:19,792
Like, The Wall Street Journal
doesn't pick the winners.

1678
00:59:19,792 --> 00:59:22,417
The three cool kids in the
crowd don't pick the winners.

1679
00:59:22,417 --> 00:59:24,667
The problem is
everybody wants to be anointed

1680
00:59:24,667 --> 00:59:26,500
a winner, or
best at what they do,

1681
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,041
before they've actually done it.

1682
00:59:28,041 --> 00:59:30,750
Let me just remind you,
and everybody else here.

1683
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:34,542
I built a business for
18 hours a day, every day,

1684
00:59:34,542 --> 00:59:38,959
running a wine liquor
store for 13 years every day.

1685
00:59:38,959 --> 00:59:40,917
Before I ever had
the audacity to come

1686
00:59:40,917 --> 00:59:43,583
to something like this and talk.

1687
00:59:44,458 --> 00:59:48,208
So, let me tell
you something amazing.

1688
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:51,125
If you're good enough,
you will win.

1689
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:54,250
But if you are upset that
somebody else's grandpappy

1690
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:57,750
got them ahead of you,
then you're gonna lose.

1691
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:59,959
Everybody started ahead of me.

1692
00:59:59,959 --> 01:00:03,000
I'm just catching up.

1693
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,625
- [Nat] And then, so just,
how would you then balance

1694
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:08,166
being ambitious
to being patient?

1695
01:00:08,166 --> 01:00:08,792
How do you--

1696
01:00:08,792 --> 01:00:11,917
- By recognizing
you have no choice.

1697
01:00:11,917 --> 01:00:14,041
(audience laughter)
- [Nat] Okay, good.

1698
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:15,333
- Do you understand?
- [Nat] Yes--

1699
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:17,250
- I'm the most
fucking ambitious,

1700
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,083
and most patient
person you've ever met.

1701
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:21,375
Which is why I'm gonna
win real, real, real big.

1702
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,458
Find your version
of that, You know?

1703
01:00:23,458 --> 01:00:25,875
Like, you have no choice.

1704
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:28,583
Who's gonna cry for you?

1705
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,000
Like, what's the choice?

1706
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,500
Are you ambitious?
- [Nat] Yeah.

1707
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,875
Awesome.

1708
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:35,750
I don't think you're as patient.

1709
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,083
- [Nat] Yeah,
that's the problem.

1710
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:38,041
- No shit.

1711
01:00:38,041 --> 01:00:40,208
(audience laughter)

1712
01:00:40,208 --> 01:00:41,375
And the problem right now,

1713
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:42,917
is that we're all
living public lives,

1714
01:00:42,917 --> 01:00:43,875
and all this horse shit.

1715
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:45,875
This is what entrepreneurship
and success looks like.

1716
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:49,041
Fucking, going to fucking
Bali, and fucking watches,

1717
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:51,250
and private jets,
it's all horse shit.

1718
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,792
Horse shit.

1719
01:00:52,792 --> 01:00:54,417
But it's fucking
with people's minds,

1720
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:55,875
and they're getting impatient.

1721
01:00:55,875 --> 01:00:58,583
I don't give a fuck
what anybody else has.

1722
01:00:58,583 --> 01:01:00,291
I'm focused on my shit.

1723
01:01:00,291 --> 01:01:01,583
Start focusing on your shit.

1724
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:03,500
You're a young woman.

1725
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,041
How old are you?

1726
01:01:05,041 --> 01:01:05,875
- [Nat] 27.

1727
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:07,250
- I'm going to
punch you in the face.

1728
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:09,375
(audience laughter)

1729
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:11,625
You have your whole
life in front of you!

1730
01:01:11,625 --> 01:01:13,000
You know what I mean?

1731
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,583
Put your head down,
and do whatever this thing

1732
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:17,458
that you wanna prove that
you're the best at, hardcore.

1733
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:20,125
If you actually
spent all your time doing,

1734
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:23,792
instead of dwelling,
you'd be much further along.

1735
01:01:23,792 --> 01:01:24,917
(audience applause)

1736
01:01:24,917 --> 01:01:25,875
Awesome.

1737
01:01:25,875 --> 01:01:27,166
I think with that I gotta go.

1738
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:28,083
I love you guys!

1739
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:30,000
(audience cheers and applause)

1740
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,667
Have a great South-By, enjoy it!

1741
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:36,625
Say hello to somebody,
that you don't know.

1742
01:01:36,625 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna shake some hands
for a few seconds right now.
