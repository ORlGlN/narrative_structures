1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,947
- It has never been

2
00:00:01,947 --> 00:00:04,859
more beneficial to be a good person

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,200
than it is right now,

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,886
because the shadows of our society

5
00:00:07,886 --> 00:00:09,078
are being exposed

6
00:00:09,078 --> 00:00:11,157
by the distribution of communication.

7
00:00:11,157 --> 00:00:13,824
(hip hop music)

8
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:20,709
What am I doing right now?

9
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:21,649
Is she here?

10
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:22,482
I want to stay on track,

11
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:23,315
I got a lot going on.

12
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:24,648
What's up, Vlog?

13
00:00:25,521 --> 00:00:27,098
What's up W.T. Clark High School

14
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:29,586
big shout out to Samir.

15
00:00:29,586 --> 00:00:32,073
Hope you're representing
Vayner proper, my man.

16
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:35,402
Two seconds for all the
high school kids, listen.

17
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,226
You're young, and that's your
strength and your weakness.

18
00:00:38,226 --> 00:00:39,059
Right?

19
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,586
First and foremost, the weakness.

20
00:00:40,586 --> 00:00:42,307
Like, you haven't accomplished shit.

21
00:00:42,307 --> 00:00:43,642
I don't know, you better beep that.

22
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:44,660
'Cause I'm sure they're
not gonna let it play

23
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,034
in a high school, but,

24
00:00:46,034 --> 00:00:47,058
edit it, beep it.

25
00:00:47,058 --> 00:00:48,590
You haven't accomplished shit!

26
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,530
And you've got the audacity like you have.

27
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,076
On the flip side that's your strength,

28
00:00:53,076 --> 00:00:53,962
you're young.

29
00:00:53,962 --> 00:00:55,394
And you've got your whole
life in front of you.

30
00:00:55,394 --> 00:00:57,380
And all of you are trying
to prove yourselves,

31
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,100
put yourself on, have stuff.

32
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,514
And that's gonna make you impatient.

33
00:01:01,514 --> 00:01:03,594
Please recognize how young you are,

34
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:05,570
and get real, real, real patient.

35
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,860
And last of all, find that thing,

36
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,901
whether it's eSports and video games

37
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:11,226
whether it's basketball,

38
00:01:11,226 --> 00:01:12,875
whether it's painting or writing,

39
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,186
people are gonna tell
you it's not practical.

40
00:01:15,186 --> 00:01:16,494
But it is.

41
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:17,938
Find your passion and go deep,

42
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:19,538
put in 18 hours of work.

43
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:20,914
Don't lay on the couch and go through your

44
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,002
Instagram feed.

45
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:24,118
Put in the work, find your passion,

46
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:26,698
know that you're young,
which means you're impatient,

47
00:01:26,698 --> 00:01:29,252
but you've got nothing but time.

48
00:01:29,252 --> 00:01:31,210
(reflective music)

49
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,538
- [Female] What advice
do you have for women

50
00:01:32,538 --> 00:01:34,210
who just kind of carry around that baggage

51
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,444
that they can't make it
as a female entrepreneur?

52
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:38,370
- You know, I think
that's a great question.

53
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,811
I think there's a couple things
that run through my mind.

54
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:40,882
Number one,

55
00:01:40,882 --> 00:01:44,266
I love that the internet
has eliminated the

56
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:46,214
truth behind a man's world.

57
00:01:46,214 --> 00:01:47,442
You know, now,

58
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:50,026
I'm not naive and I don't
want to come across tone-deaf.

59
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,450
I am the first and have been for

60
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,962
long before it was popular,

61
00:01:53,962 --> 00:01:55,650
like it sure seems now,

62
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,050
like everybody's different.

63
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,026
There are clearly advantages
for being a white male

64
00:01:59,026 --> 00:02:00,025
in America,

65
00:02:00,025 --> 00:02:01,850
versus a female, versus a minority,

66
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,946
versus being born in Iran,

67
00:02:03,946 --> 00:02:05,671
that's just real life.

68
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:06,939
I think the bigger part,

69
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:09,201
and I was an early investor in Birchbox

70
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:10,995
and Micmac and brit.co

71
00:02:10,995 --> 00:02:11,828
and

72
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:13,576
I've, to be very frank

73
00:02:13,576 --> 00:02:14,805
have done quite well with my

74
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:16,253
female entrepreneurial ventures

75
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:18,861
because they have been underpriced in cost

76
00:02:18,861 --> 00:02:21,671
because it has been a
'man's world' in VC Land.

77
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:24,141
And there has been a disrespect
of the female entrepreneur.

78
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:27,374
And I'm not Mother Teresa
or this amazing human being,

79
00:02:27,374 --> 00:02:28,957
I'm just a businessman and I'm like,

80
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:31,501
it would never cross my mind to think that

81
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:34,261
a woman or an alien or a Latino

82
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:36,189
couldn't do it as well.

83
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,229
And so,

84
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:39,485
in a weird way I think
I took advantage of the

85
00:02:39,485 --> 00:02:42,161
shortcomings of a lot of white males

86
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:43,951
and it was mainly on
the back of knowing that

87
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:45,957
the internet doesn't
give a shit who you are.

88
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,781
My thesis that I wrote in Crush It,

89
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:49,302
and The Thank You Economy

90
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,949
has played out, which is,

91
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:52,278
the internet doesn't care.

92
00:02:52,278 --> 00:02:54,021
Everybody's got a shot.

93
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:57,063
You're more than welcome
to go on Twitter and CNN

94
00:02:57,063 --> 00:02:59,936
and dwell from 7pm to 11pm

95
00:02:59,936 --> 00:03:02,948
and shit on everybody, and call people out

96
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:06,482
and be upset and say this
one's bad and this one's good.

97
00:03:06,482 --> 00:03:08,961
How about instead of those
four hours dwelling in the muck

98
00:03:08,961 --> 00:03:12,255
of all this, realizing that
what it means is this is the

99
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:15,199
greatest opportunity ever
for anybody and everybody.

100
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,639
Because as long as you have this

101
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,343
and I get emails from
people that are homeless

102
00:03:18,343 --> 00:03:19,880
every single day of my life,

103
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,009
who have this.

104
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:22,848
This is an unlock.

105
00:03:22,848 --> 00:03:25,135
We need perspective.

106
00:03:25,135 --> 00:03:26,687
Like everybody's on
their fuckin' high horse

107
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:27,895
and judging.

108
00:03:27,895 --> 00:03:30,608
For every entrepreneur
that's listening right now,

109
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:32,431
go on the offense!

110
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:33,991
What do I say?

111
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:37,343
Make that woman chip on
your shoulder get real big

112
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:39,943
and use it as a driver of positivity

113
00:03:39,943 --> 00:03:42,831
and opportunity, not looking backwards.

114
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:44,159
Whatever you are,

115
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,623
being the best version of what you are is

116
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:47,336
always going to be the right strategy and

117
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:50,113
I think we need to talk
more about self awareness.

118
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:52,369
The secret sauce is don't
overcomplicate stuff.

119
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:53,831
You have to work hard

120
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:55,527
you have to work smart,
you have to be empathetic

121
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,375
and grateful, you have to
be positive and optimistic

122
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:01,017
and every time you're not,

123
00:04:01,017 --> 00:04:03,063
you're giving points off the board.

124
00:04:03,063 --> 00:04:04,280
You don't have to be optimistic,

125
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,617
maybe you were born pessimistic.

126
00:04:05,617 --> 00:04:09,233
But please understand that
will detrimentally hurt you

127
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:10,900
in your ambitions of

128
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,576
if you want to be an entrepreneur

129
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:15,480
because it takes blind optimism,

130
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,856
because everything in
your face every day is

131
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:17,976
telling you no.

132
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:21,152
And you're completely,
completely committed to yes.

133
00:04:21,152 --> 00:04:22,272
- [Ray Dalio] Hello, Gary!

134
00:04:22,272 --> 00:04:23,402
- It's good to see you, Ray.

135
00:04:23,402 --> 00:04:24,408
- Now I get to do to you

136
00:04:24,408 --> 00:04:25,477
what you did to me!
(laughs)

137
00:04:25,477 --> 00:04:27,128
- The tide is turning.

138
00:04:27,128 --> 00:04:28,523
- I'm in control.

139
00:04:28,523 --> 00:04:29,432
- I'm worried about this!

140
00:04:29,432 --> 00:04:30,515
- I know!

141
00:04:30,515 --> 00:04:31,904
- This is real energy coming from you.

142
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:32,936
- Okay!
- I'm excited.

143
00:04:32,936 --> 00:04:34,200
- Okay and I'm in control.

144
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,033
Gary!

145
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:35,866
- Yes, sir.

146
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:36,920
- Okay, we're gonna do this.

147
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,184
I'm gonna do it to you, man.

148
00:04:38,184 --> 00:04:39,017
- I'm listening.

149
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:39,850
- Okay.

150
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,683
So

151
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:41,516
what I'm trying to do is to

152
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:42,516
help you all

153
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:46,658
understand what the best
principles of winners are.

154
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:49,954
They're winning because
they're doing things.

155
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:52,421
They're operating by recipes, essentially.

156
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:54,239
They're doing those things over and over

157
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:55,653
that makes them winners.

158
00:04:55,653 --> 00:04:57,933
Okay so Gary is a winner.

159
00:04:57,933 --> 00:04:59,773
And now we're gonna get into

160
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:01,287
Gary's principles.

161
00:05:01,287 --> 00:05:02,120
- [Gary] Here we go.

162
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,032
- Here we go!

163
00:05:03,032 --> 00:05:04,356
What do you think you're going after

164
00:05:04,356 --> 00:05:06,533
and where did it come from?

165
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:08,050
- My intuition on this

166
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,047
and I do think I spend a lot of time on it

167
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:10,887
is,

168
00:05:10,887 --> 00:05:13,727
I feel like I'm going after

169
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:15,060
all-time legacy.

170
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:20,564
I think that it comes from a mix of

171
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:26,028
guilt, gratitude, insecurity and optimism.

172
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:31,247
Because I was such a poor
student at such a young age

173
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,090
- [Ray] Me too.

174
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,287
- And because I wasn't a good athlete,

175
00:05:34,287 --> 00:05:35,402
in any shape or form,

176
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:38,951
it eliminated the two things
that boys were judged on

177
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:39,839
when I grew up.

178
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,711
Either you were a good
student and going to Harvard,

179
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:44,679
or you were a tremendous
athlete and going to USC.

180
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,376
I was neither.

181
00:05:46,376 --> 00:05:48,159
Entrepreneurship was surely not cool

182
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,826
in 1984, 5, 6 and 7.

183
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,744
So what I was doing off the field

184
00:05:52,744 --> 00:05:53,791
or out of school

185
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,177
was making money,

186
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:57,671
but that wasn't deemed as a merit

187
00:05:57,671 --> 00:05:58,975
or a remarkable act.

188
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:00,159
- I hear you.

189
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,543
And so that void of the intellectual

190
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:04,708
is then also what

191
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,168
you're demonstrating.
- 100 percent.

192
00:06:06,168 --> 00:06:07,001
- Great!

193
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:09,880
- I am completely driven
by a chip on my shoulder.

194
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,297
On my upbringing,

195
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,327
except that I am empathetic
to everybody else

196
00:06:15,327 --> 00:06:17,687
so it's not manifesting as a negative.

197
00:06:17,687 --> 00:06:19,120
It's manifesting as a positive.

198
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,511
- Boy, you're doing a good job, man.

199
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,184
Okay, this is going good.

200
00:06:22,184 --> 00:06:25,235
Tell me about those principles
that you think would be

201
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:26,561
helpful, that have helped you.

202
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:27,728
- No question.

203
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,089
I am an unbelievable buyer,

204
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:34,756
and I think the grossly
underestimated trait

205
00:06:36,424 --> 00:06:38,424
in the capitalistic game

206
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:40,585
is empathy.

207
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:42,321
Empathy will give you leverage

208
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:43,451
with the other party.

209
00:06:43,451 --> 00:06:44,284
- Boom!

210
00:06:44,284 --> 00:06:45,169
There's a principle!

211
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:46,313
- But because of empathy

212
00:06:46,313 --> 00:06:48,633
and it is my binary north star,

213
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:52,992
I temper my expectations
of others on my team

214
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:55,492
and try to be realistic
to their realities.

215
00:06:55,492 --> 00:06:58,304
Watching others with a lot of freedom

216
00:06:58,304 --> 00:07:00,352
gives me context of how to put them in the

217
00:07:00,352 --> 00:07:02,107
best position to succeed.

218
00:07:02,107 --> 00:07:04,452
- Insecurity will lead

219
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:06,285
to undermining actions

220
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,773
that hurt the merit of your organization.

221
00:07:09,773 --> 00:07:13,211
I am dumbfounded by people
positioning themselves

222
00:07:13,211 --> 00:07:16,772
and their businesses
as if life is a sprint

223
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:18,747
when it is clearly a marathon.

224
00:07:18,747 --> 00:07:20,484
I am devastated

225
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:22,733
that people make short
term financial decisions

226
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,539
to buy something that
closes the short term gap

227
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:26,857
in their insecurity,

228
00:07:26,857 --> 00:07:28,275
and at the undermining of

229
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:29,810
their long-term wealth and happiness.

230
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,643
- Okay.

231
00:07:30,643 --> 00:07:34,492
- Having humility to carry
two opposing points of view

232
00:07:34,492 --> 00:07:35,814
and making them rub up against each other

233
00:07:35,814 --> 00:07:36,829
- Okay, that's another one!

234
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:37,662
(laughs)

235
00:07:37,662 --> 00:07:38,495
So let's,

236
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,545
we're gonna split that, okay?

237
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:41,027
- I've got principle for days, kids!

238
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:41,860
- Okay.

239
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,693
- You know,
- Okay

240
00:07:42,693 --> 00:07:44,092
- Having the humility to be able to

241
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:44,972
- Have humility

242
00:07:44,972 --> 00:07:48,476
- Have humility in being
able to carry opposing views

243
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:51,213
on an issue, and then creating friction

244
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:53,757
and making a judgment in
the context of the moment.

245
00:07:53,757 --> 00:07:54,590
- Failure.

246
00:07:55,444 --> 00:07:56,777
- Is tremendous.

247
00:07:58,621 --> 00:08:00,508
I'm wearing a New York
Jets Christmas sweater,

248
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:02,998
not a New York Yankees Christmas sweater.

249
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:06,446
And at six years old, I
passionately cared about both.

250
00:08:06,446 --> 00:08:08,996
There's deep insight into my love affair

251
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:10,487
with the Jets and the Knicks.

252
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:11,320
They have

253
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,232
- Tell me in the failure

254
00:08:12,232 --> 00:08:13,231
how, follow that through,

255
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:14,064
what you do like

256
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:15,055
about failure?
- I prefer

257
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:17,391
I prefer the journey over the riches.

258
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:21,169
My personal wealth is disproportionately

259
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:23,649
being sabotaged by myself

260
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:26,880
because I enjoy the
process of gathering it.

261
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,844
I literally think I

262
00:08:27,844 --> 00:08:29,286
- That's smart.

263
00:08:29,286 --> 00:08:30,973
It's smart because you're not

264
00:08:30,973 --> 00:08:32,749
you're out, look.

265
00:08:32,749 --> 00:08:34,597
What you're doing is you're realizing

266
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,102
what really has value.

267
00:08:37,102 --> 00:08:38,114
Okay?
- You're right.

268
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:40,472
- Money, one of the challenges of money is

269
00:08:40,472 --> 00:08:42,414
it's easy to count.

270
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:43,870
And because it's easy to count,

271
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:45,431
then people sort of say, I count it up

272
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:46,503
but I got more of that

273
00:08:46,503 --> 00:08:47,929
and that's the thing of success.

274
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:50,983
If you can have happiness points,

275
00:08:50,983 --> 00:08:52,271
if you can count happiness

276
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:53,104
- [Gary] I'm winning

277
00:08:53,104 --> 00:08:54,591
- We would optimize for happiness

278
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:58,568
so what you're doing is
optimizing for happiness,

279
00:08:58,568 --> 00:09:00,258
you're not optimizing for money.

280
00:09:00,258 --> 00:09:01,639
That's a lot smarter.

281
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,210
- There's so much more upside on both

282
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,521
legacy and wealth

283
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:06,647
when you make it about legacy.

284
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,816
Especially compounded in,

285
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:10,639
what people do very poorly,

286
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,472
here is a principle.

287
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:14,847
People are very bad at understanding

288
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,991
the new context of communication

289
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:19,095
and they're deploying old principles

290
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:20,400
on new playing fields.

291
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,495
It has never been

292
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,087
more beneficial

293
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:26,695
to be a good person than it is right now,

294
00:09:26,695 --> 00:09:28,703
because the shadows of
our society are being

295
00:09:28,703 --> 00:09:31,970
exposed by the distribution
of communication.

296
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,751
Owning your shortcomings

297
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:36,679
and bringing awareness to them

298
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:39,399
is disproportionate strength and leverage

299
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,327
in the long term.

300
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:41,160
- Boom!

301
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,820
- Which is exposing your own shortcomings,

302
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,580
morally, intellectually,

303
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,413
everything!

304
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:50,805
Exposing your own shortcomings
is disproportionate

305
00:09:50,805 --> 00:09:53,531
strength and leverage in our society.

306
00:09:53,531 --> 00:09:55,468
Did you see 8 Mile, the Eminem movie?

307
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:56,301
- No.

308
00:09:56,301 --> 00:09:57,134
- I want you to.

309
00:09:57,134 --> 00:09:57,967
And I mean it.

310
00:09:57,967 --> 00:09:58,800
- I will!

311
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,633
- But only because I want you to see the

312
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:00,883
last battle rap.

313
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:02,796
Because in the last battle rap,

314
00:10:02,796 --> 00:10:04,275
Eminem's rap,

315
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:05,675
instead of making fun of the other guy

316
00:10:05,675 --> 00:10:07,630
which is the framework
of the game of battle rap

317
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,924
- Yeah I have a son who battles.

318
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:09,757
- Love it!

319
00:10:09,757 --> 00:10:10,840
He,

320
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,459
he made fun of himself the entire time,

321
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:14,879
leaving the other person

322
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:15,916
nothing.

323
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,008
- Relationships

324
00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:18,783
- 51/49.

325
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:21,665
Give 51 percent of the
value of the relationship

326
00:10:21,665 --> 00:10:23,057
to the other person,

327
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:25,392
and figure out how to maximize the 49.

328
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:26,271
- This was good!

329
00:10:26,271 --> 00:10:27,104
- Thank you.

330
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:27,937
- Great!
- Thank you so much.

331
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:28,895
Thank you everyone.

332
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:31,812
(reflective music)

333
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:48,677
The person that can make
America or the world

334
00:10:48,677 --> 00:10:50,047
give a shit about things that they

335
00:10:50,047 --> 00:10:51,461
don't give a shit about

336
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:52,414
yet

337
00:10:52,414 --> 00:10:54,550
is going to win this new world.

338
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,467
We need to make people in the world

339
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,397
care about the human
beings behind these sports,

340
00:11:01,397 --> 00:11:05,021
not hoping pickleball
gets popular somewhat,

341
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:08,585
but looking at the current
state of pickleball,

342
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,241
and saying, holy shit!

343
00:11:10,241 --> 00:11:12,521
There's this LeBron or holy shit,

344
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:15,666
there's the Andre Agassi of pickleball!

345
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,999
And we're gonna turn him into a Vine 2.0

346
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:22,137
Snapchat, Instagram star

347
00:11:22,137 --> 00:11:24,251
because that's where the leverage sits.

348
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:27,585
I think that's the
machine you need to build.

349
00:11:27,585 --> 00:11:29,993
The propaganda human machine compliment

350
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:33,474
to the stars of the 47 sub-sports

351
00:11:33,474 --> 00:11:35,442
that you're gonna try to create,

352
00:11:35,442 --> 00:11:37,049
now we've got something.

353
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:41,049
(hip hop music from smartphone)

354
00:11:50,065 --> 00:11:53,148
(light, happy music)

355
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:02,799
(bell ding)

356
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,287
(texting)

357
00:12:20,984 --> 00:12:21,817
Hey are you filming?

358
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:22,979
- Yeah.

359
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:24,250
- Vlog, real quick

360
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,544
just a great moment just happened.

361
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:26,632
Literally,

362
00:12:26,632 --> 00:12:28,736
Kyle's been dressed up ridiculously

363
00:12:28,736 --> 00:12:30,560
been filming all day, dumb shit

364
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,928
stuff that had no shot.

365
00:12:31,928 --> 00:12:33,888
We just had the moment of the episode,

366
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:35,064
and he's got the camera like,

367
00:12:35,064 --> 00:12:36,784
sticking into his, like, thigh.

368
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:38,536
(laughs)

369
00:12:38,536 --> 00:12:42,136
Kyle the whole purpose
of filming everything is

370
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,521
knowing that at any moment,

371
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:45,480
I can throw out the haymaker that

372
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,230
changes the course of one's life!

373
00:12:50,876 --> 00:12:54,750
- So, are you talking about the same day?

374
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,502
- Alright, what's going on here?!

375
00:12:56,502 --> 00:12:57,335
What's this meeting about?

376
00:12:57,335 --> 00:12:58,168
How are you?

377
00:12:58,168 --> 00:12:59,001
- Good, how are you?

378
00:12:59,001 --> 00:12:59,834
(bell ding)
- Heading to the airport.

379
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:00,667
- Yeah.

380
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:01,500
- Good, man, good.

381
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,333
- What's up, I'm Jake, nice to meet you.

382
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,166
- Such a pleasure, man.

383
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,125
- You were just talking to Elliott?

384
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,756
He's the only artist we ever met with

385
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:06,979
(bell ding)
who was like actually

386
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:09,225
social hacking on Instagram.

387
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:10,623
And then he's doing cool
things with the fans

388
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,111
that Quinn put me onto

389
00:13:12,111 --> 00:13:13,207
where he's like,

390
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:14,257
he told all the kids,

391
00:13:14,257 --> 00:13:17,184
yo, play my new song over
the intercom in your school,

392
00:13:17,184 --> 00:13:18,400
and I'll feature you.

393
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,911
- Haaaaa!
- Kids are getting suspended!

394
00:13:19,911 --> 00:13:21,320
They're getting suspended from school!

395
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,399
- That's what's up!

396
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,031
- So we actually had to like, stop!

397
00:13:24,031 --> 00:13:25,519
- So if he did that,

398
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,304
and he's doing hacking like

399
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:28,865
what you were talking about with Dunk

400
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:30,311
then you're gonna win because

401
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:32,211
you have actual music down

402
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,615
that I already know.

403
00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:36,575
And then the only other part
that matters is distribution.

404
00:13:36,575 --> 00:13:38,664
And you are naturally,

405
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:40,463
it comes natural to you

406
00:13:40,463 --> 00:13:42,271
to hack distribution.

407
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,536
I always talk about the example of P Diddy

408
00:13:43,536 --> 00:13:45,288
going on TRL.

409
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:47,639
Or when I wear Christmas
sweaters courtside

410
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,350
at basketball games,

411
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:54,338
it's just understanding
what's gonna get you heard!

412
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:55,376
The end.

413
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,209
The end!

414
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:57,145
It's only two things.

415
00:13:57,145 --> 00:13:58,617
Is it good enough?

416
00:13:58,617 --> 00:14:01,671
And will people fuckin' hear it?

417
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:02,822
Straight up!

418
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:04,410
You know what's amazing
about you youngsters?

419
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,295
You guys are coming with so
much more entrepreneurial savvy

420
00:14:07,295 --> 00:14:09,167
than the crew that came before you.

421
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:10,910
Everybody's trying to be a mogul out here.

422
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,743
It's cool!

423
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:12,576
It's good, man,

424
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:14,495
that's how you really win.

425
00:14:14,495 --> 00:14:17,062
Dollars are more interesting than cents.

426
00:14:17,062 --> 00:14:18,991
And everybody was settling for cents.

427
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:19,824
(laughs)
You know?

428
00:14:19,824 --> 00:14:23,208
Everybody was settling for cents and

429
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,217
Puff and Jay-Z and Birdman, those guys

430
00:14:25,217 --> 00:14:26,478
deserve a lot of credit,

431
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:29,767
they started to create a framework.

432
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:30,960
So good.

433
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,793
Makes me happy, man.

434
00:14:31,793 --> 00:14:32,670
Good for you, how old are you?

435
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,503
- 18.

436
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:34,449
(laughs)

437
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:35,454
- That's what's up, man.

438
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:36,574
- So young, man.

439
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:37,407
- Yeah man.

440
00:14:37,407 --> 00:14:38,240
Is there anything I can help you with?

441
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,410
Let me know.

442
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,763
Music in the vlog,

443
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:41,946
like if you want to

444
00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:44,698
my number one recommendation,

445
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:46,586
the same thing you're
doing with kids in school,

446
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:49,190
go hard after YouTube vloggers

447
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,766
and get your music in their fuckin' vlogs.

448
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,854
It's the number one.

449
00:14:53,854 --> 00:14:55,957
You get Jake and Paul to put

450
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:58,247
using your song or Casey or

451
00:14:58,247 --> 00:14:59,080
and by the way,

452
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,913
those are the ones just

453
00:14:59,913 --> 00:15:00,916
I know them and they're big,

454
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,583
there's fuckin' a hundred
thousand vloggers!

455
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,655
Collaborations in your music too.

456
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:06,572
Not, not up

457
00:15:07,663 --> 00:15:08,599
but wide.

458
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:09,432
Let me explain.

459
00:15:09,432 --> 00:15:10,391
Not sitting here and be like,

460
00:15:10,391 --> 00:15:12,071
oh shit we gotta do
something with Gucci Mane

461
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:13,959
or 21 Savage or something like that.

462
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:14,792
Post Malone

463
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:16,103
No.

464
00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:17,471
Can

465
00:15:17,471 --> 00:15:18,417
well that's where I'm going.

466
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,327
Are there people in Country or Pop or Jazz

467
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:22,911
that are comin' up like you too,

468
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:24,743
that you just like their flavor?

469
00:15:24,743 --> 00:15:27,367
Or, I thought Logic did it right.

470
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:29,099
Or just in culture?

471
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:31,537
With fuckin' auto-tune,
even Void could sound good!

472
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:33,479
What if somebody's just winning in life?

473
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:36,799
Baby Ariel just put out music.

474
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:37,777
I don't know it just feels like

475
00:15:37,777 --> 00:15:40,039
almost anybody can get in
the game in certain ways

476
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,760
with the technology advances
and post-production.

477
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,319
So just being smart, you know?

478
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:45,152
- Yeah.

479
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:45,985
- Like,

480
00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:48,010
Russell Westbrook to

481
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,730
some girl that's got 19
million followers on Snap.

482
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,426
Can I give you a good piece of advice?

483
00:15:53,426 --> 00:15:54,601
- Yeah.

484
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:56,233
- Be patient.

485
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:57,641
That's the only thing that,

486
00:15:57,641 --> 00:15:59,138
that's your kryptonite right now.

487
00:15:59,138 --> 00:15:59,971
You got,

488
00:15:59,971 --> 00:16:01,641
you clearly have your shit together.

489
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:04,161
The only thing that's gonna fuck you up

490
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:05,833
is, 'cause you know what's gonna happen,

491
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,129
you can feel it.

492
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:08,403
And sometimes youngsters are just like,

493
00:16:08,403 --> 00:16:10,689
fuck, why hasn't it happened?

494
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:11,825
Like 13 months from now.

495
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:16,537
Happen like that song that
completely changed shit.

496
00:16:16,537 --> 00:16:18,524
And then they start doing shortcuts.

497
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:20,305
Signing with somebody dumb,

498
00:16:20,305 --> 00:16:22,225
doing a collab with somebody dumb,

499
00:16:22,225 --> 00:16:23,833
talking about something
they don't believe in,

500
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,753
just 'cause they think it
will make a song popular.

501
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:27,233
They deviate.

502
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:29,649
This next chapter is
the most important one.

503
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:32,158
This is the one that decides everything.

504
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,085
It's easy to stay down

505
00:16:34,085 --> 00:16:36,912
when there's nothing to go up to.

506
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,968
But when you're on the cusp,

507
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:40,392
that's,

508
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:41,340
it's what I do.

509
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,440
It's hard, like I'm fuck

510
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,346
I won.

511
00:16:43,346 --> 00:16:45,344
But I'm trying to win
the whole fuckin' thing,

512
00:16:45,344 --> 00:16:47,273
so I'm just eatin' shit, still.

513
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:48,106
- One love.

514
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:48,977
Take a picture, man.

515
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:49,977
- A hundred.

516
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:52,552
- I appreciate you.

517
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:55,075
- I wish you nothing but the best.

518
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:57,408
(bell ding)

519
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:01,873
I might steal your hoodie.

520
00:17:01,873 --> 00:17:03,033
Your beanie.

521
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:03,866
- You can't.

522
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:04,699
- I don't think I have

523
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:05,866
do I have one?

524
00:17:07,705 --> 00:17:09,112
- Oh shit.

525
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:11,049
- Was this mine or was
it yours originally?

526
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:11,955
- It was mine.

527
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:13,473
- Tyler.

528
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:14,886
- Now it's mine.

529
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:15,895
But you're disappointed

530
00:17:15,895 --> 00:17:17,343
'cause he was just kind
of weirdly borrowing it

531
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:18,499
and then you were gonna have it?

532
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:19,696
- Nah.
- No!

533
00:17:19,696 --> 00:17:21,318
No

534
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,791
- I need more beanies.

535
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,208
Guys, this is the

536
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:26,009
You don't want me to do that,

537
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,625
you want me to make a
beanie situation, right?

538
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,187
But in totally of the beanie situation,

539
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:32,765
let me put all the aspiring entrepreneurs

540
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:33,598
that are trying to build

541
00:17:33,598 --> 00:17:34,431
look at Baller!

542
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:35,264
Look at Yeast!

543
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:36,559
What do you think we're doing here?

544
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,527
We're putting people on!

545
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:38,360
Fuckin' hustle!

546
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,762
Send me some fuckin'
beanies and I'll wear 'em.

547
00:17:39,762 --> 00:17:41,766
'Cause Tyler's not my fuckin' boss!

548
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:43,704
And when I come out with
a beanie collaboration

549
00:17:43,704 --> 00:17:45,593
with a huge brand, like K-Swiss

550
00:17:45,593 --> 00:17:47,286
huge meaning, I can refurbish it

551
00:17:47,286 --> 00:17:48,706
or it's fuckin' huge,

552
00:17:48,706 --> 00:17:50,519
call me, fuckin' Adidas.

553
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,559
Until I have a fuckin' beanie deal,

554
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,760
or start my own Vee fuckin' beanie,

555
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,502
which we've tried to start a year ago

556
00:17:56,502 --> 00:17:57,510
and didn't,

557
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,494
I'm gonna give to my community

558
00:17:59,494 --> 00:18:00,551
and put people on,

559
00:18:00,551 --> 00:18:01,526
and get exposure for them,

560
00:18:01,526 --> 00:18:02,742
is that okay with you, Tyler?

561
00:18:02,742 --> 00:18:03,686
- More than okay!

562
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:04,735
- Alright.

563
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:06,646
To sell something they're passionate about

564
00:18:06,646 --> 00:18:08,473
so it feels like a hobby
and not a business.

565
00:18:08,473 --> 00:18:10,343
Do not run after the money,

566
00:18:10,343 --> 00:18:11,176
right?

567
00:18:11,176 --> 00:18:14,093
Don't go after sneakers or slime or

568
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,472
iPhone cases 'cause
that's where the money is.

569
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,800
Sell something around

570
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,217
an elf costume or

571
00:18:23,873 --> 00:18:26,684
Smurfs or Captain Crunch cereal

572
00:18:26,684 --> 00:18:28,332
because you love it.

573
00:18:28,332 --> 00:18:29,388
Big side hustles,

574
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:32,156
side hustles require passion.

575
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:34,356
Because you're already
tired from your real job

576
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:35,308
and so if you're gonna do something from

577
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:37,564
8pm to 4 in the morning,

578
00:18:37,564 --> 00:18:39,516
well it might as well be the
same thing that you would have

579
00:18:39,516 --> 00:18:41,492
watched the movie of or played

580
00:18:41,492 --> 00:18:43,845
whether it's soccer or video games or

581
00:18:43,845 --> 00:18:44,678
just

582
00:18:44,678 --> 00:18:46,748
your side hustle has to be completely,

583
00:18:46,748 --> 00:18:48,028
completely tied to your passion

584
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:50,165
otherwise you won't have
the energy to succeed.

585
00:18:50,165 --> 00:18:51,748
Definitely not, I'm not
doing the behavior yet

586
00:18:51,748 --> 00:18:53,452
to buy the Jets, but

587
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:54,785
2038 feels good.

588
00:18:58,965 --> 00:19:00,141
If you're working on the fuckin' project,

589
00:19:00,141 --> 00:19:01,151
the Plane Project.

590
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:01,984
(bell ding)

591
00:19:01,984 --> 00:19:02,817
- Not yet
- Did you guys watch

592
00:19:02,817 --> 00:19:03,650
the videos yet?
(bell ding)

593
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,483
- Not yet.

594
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:05,316
- Did you?

595
00:19:05,316 --> 00:19:06,149
- It's on the list.

596
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:06,982
- Did you, Kyle?

597
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:07,815
Don't lie.
- I'm gonna watch this weekend

598
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:09,944
- [Kyle] I watched the
opening one in the email.

599
00:19:09,944 --> 00:19:10,777
Colin did

600
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,103
- Hello.

601
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:14,936
Has,

602
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:15,769
hey team,

603
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:17,386
have you guys watched the videos?

604
00:19:17,386 --> 00:19:19,241
Because three people haven't.

605
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,455
Have you watched them?

606
00:19:20,455 --> 00:19:21,288
Have you?

607
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:22,121
- No.

608
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:26,292
- Don't lie.

609
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:27,323
(laughs)

610
00:19:27,323 --> 00:19:28,333
- [Female] Lying is the devil.

611
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,416
(laughs)

612
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:33,006
- Can you guys watch them, please?

613
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:33,862
- Yeah.
- Sure.

614
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:34,862
- Thank you.

615
00:19:39,123 --> 00:19:39,956
Such a pleasure.

616
00:19:39,956 --> 00:19:40,789
- Nice to meet you.

617
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:41,622
- How are you?

618
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:42,455
- Hi.
- Hi.

619
00:19:47,996 --> 00:19:49,552
What up, man?

620
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:51,018
- Got the kicks.

621
00:19:51,018 --> 00:19:52,408
- I love it man.

622
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:53,241
Want me to sign 'em?

623
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:54,330
- Yeah.

624
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,544
- You tryin' to make
that side hustle money

625
00:19:55,544 --> 00:19:56,713
or you gonna wear 'em?

626
00:19:56,713 --> 00:19:57,936
- Nah I'm putting these in a box,

627
00:19:57,936 --> 00:19:58,769
I'm saving them!

628
00:19:58,769 --> 00:19:59,602
- Smart.

629
00:19:59,602 --> 00:20:01,899
That long-term investment.

630
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:04,469
(bell ding)

631
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:05,302
Hello, sir.

632
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:06,135
- How are you?

633
00:20:06,135 --> 00:20:07,552
- I am very well.

634
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,980
Thought you might want to
put this in your office.

635
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,220
(laughs)

636
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,426
- I mean, if it was

637
00:20:22,426 --> 00:20:23,581
- Is that Larry Bird?

638
00:20:23,581 --> 00:20:25,084
It doesn't really look
like Larry, you know?

639
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:25,967
- Slapping me?

640
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:26,996
- Trippin' you off in your office!

641
00:20:26,996 --> 00:20:27,929
- Do what you do

642
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:28,765
- I love it!

643
00:20:28,765 --> 00:20:32,306
(slowed down audio)
I love it, I love it!

644
00:20:32,306 --> 00:20:33,154
Go!

645
00:20:33,154 --> 00:20:34,633
(slowed down audio)
- Okay!

646
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,521
- Am I gonna have to fight Ray Dalio now?

647
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:37,354
Yo!

648
00:20:37,354 --> 00:20:39,266
Ray Dalio, 3pm at the flag pole!

649
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:40,099
Fuck this!

650
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,865
Hello.

651
00:20:42,865 --> 00:20:44,198
- Hello.
- Hello.

652
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,286
- Hello.

653
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,560
So,

654
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,768
a couple great things happened
with me not having wi-fi

655
00:20:49,768 --> 00:20:50,754
yesterday on my flight home.

656
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:51,994
Number one,

657
00:20:51,994 --> 00:20:53,114
I created a new

658
00:20:53,114 --> 00:20:55,410
a new version of making an album

659
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,315
it's called,

660
00:20:56,315 --> 00:20:57,525
13 rants in a row.

661
00:20:57,525 --> 00:20:59,329
I'll be launching that on Tuesday.

662
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:00,938
I'm not joking, I'm
super excited about it.

663
00:21:00,938 --> 00:21:02,802
I think it's not gonna work.

664
00:21:02,802 --> 00:21:04,065
But,

665
00:21:04,065 --> 00:21:05,508
I'm excited that I'm doing it.

666
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:06,691
(laughs)

667
00:21:06,691 --> 00:21:07,862
And then I finished that in time.

668
00:21:07,862 --> 00:21:09,028
By the way this is
literally what happened.

669
00:21:09,028 --> 00:21:10,550
Note, the wi-fi was broken,

670
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:13,022
I went to sleep right away
'cause I hadn't slept in like

671
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,110
48 hours.

672
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,446
But was so

673
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:16,766
knew that I had to do work

674
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:18,071
and get some answers for everybody,

675
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:20,870
that I spooked myself
after an hour and woke up.

676
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,199
Then tried to get on wi-fi for 30 minutes,

677
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,830
looked at the map and when you're

678
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,917
close to the North Pole,

679
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,750
sometimes it doesn't work.

680
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,863
Then they told me it was broken.

681
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:29,381
I got pissed!

682
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:31,086
Then I crushed my email

683
00:21:31,086 --> 00:21:32,126
that it was in there

684
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:32,959
as you guys

685
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,502
some of you got that.

686
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,054
Then I still had four hours,

687
00:21:37,054 --> 00:21:38,030
so I decided, you know what?

688
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:38,950
Fuck it, I deserve it,

689
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:39,783
let me watch a movie.

690
00:21:39,783 --> 00:21:41,254
I watched the Tupac movie, right?

691
00:21:41,254 --> 00:21:42,136
(laughs)

692
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:43,070
I watched the Tupac movie,

693
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,757
and got so inspired

694
00:21:44,757 --> 00:21:46,582
(laughs)
that I decide to literally

695
00:21:46,582 --> 00:21:48,938
and like, I cried in one video.

696
00:21:48,938 --> 00:21:50,350
D-Rock, you saw the
parenting one is crazy.

697
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,519
Did you cry a little?

698
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,574
- [D-Rock] Which one was that?

699
00:21:52,574 --> 00:21:53,654
- There's a video that can get

700
00:21:53,654 --> 00:21:55,494
50 million on Facebook if it hits right.

701
00:21:55,494 --> 00:21:57,724
About just asking parents to stop

702
00:21:57,724 --> 00:21:59,405
imposing their insecurity on their kids.

703
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:01,046
Like, just really good shit,

704
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:02,110
like four or five minutes.

705
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,405
Not my normal minute rants.

706
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,014
They're long

707
00:22:05,014 --> 00:22:06,334
and like, anyway.

708
00:22:06,334 --> 00:22:09,251
(reflective music)

709
00:22:13,622 --> 00:22:14,455
(laughs)

710
00:22:14,455 --> 00:22:15,326
Is this a private

711
00:22:15,326 --> 00:22:16,592
event?
- [Group] Heyyy!

712
00:22:16,592 --> 00:22:17,934
- [Gary] Is like a private pre-party?

713
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:18,767
- [Man] Yeah.

714
00:22:18,767 --> 00:22:20,038
- [Gary] You guys are pre-gaming?

715
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:23,168
- [Woman] We're waiting
for the crowd to thin out!

716
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:24,900
- [Gary] I like you guys' arbitrage.

717
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,733
- [Woman] We're the media team!

718
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:26,836
- [Gary] You guys are quanting out.

719
00:22:26,836 --> 00:22:27,669
How'd it go?

720
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:28,884
- Winding down.

721
00:22:28,884 --> 00:22:30,352
- Wait, question.

722
00:22:30,352 --> 00:22:31,900
You know Tabby?

723
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,733
- Tabby?

724
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:33,652
Of course, the artist?

725
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:34,665
- Yeah.
- Yes.

726
00:22:34,665 --> 00:22:35,972
- So I was supposed to
email you about this

727
00:22:35,972 --> 00:22:37,524
but I didn't 'cause I started a month ago

728
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:38,357
and I was nervous.

729
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,190
(laughs)

730
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,568
I've had like, two glasses of wine.

731
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:41,401
So,

732
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,234
- You're all warmed up.

733
00:22:42,234 --> 00:22:43,380
- I went to high school with her.

734
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,213
- Get the fuck out of here.

735
00:22:44,213 --> 00:22:45,046
- Yeah.

736
00:22:45,046 --> 00:22:45,879
She's a year

737
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:46,712
younger than me.
- She's super sweet.

738
00:22:46,712 --> 00:22:47,545
- So sweet.

739
00:22:47,545 --> 00:22:48,378
In the office the other day,

740
00:22:48,378 --> 00:22:49,211
I don't think you were here

741
00:22:49,211 --> 00:22:50,162
- I,

742
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:52,018
I think she's gonna be a star.

743
00:22:52,018 --> 00:22:52,851
- Yeah.

744
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:53,684
She's awesome.

745
00:22:53,684 --> 00:22:55,010
(bell ding)

746
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,498
Always been like,

747
00:22:56,498 --> 00:22:58,005
really like, go-get-'er,

748
00:22:58,005 --> 00:22:59,147
entrepreneur.

749
00:22:59,147 --> 00:23:01,026
- Lindsay Bernstein

750
00:23:01,026 --> 00:23:01,943
- Hi Linds.

751
00:23:03,284 --> 00:23:04,504
- [Group] Wooo!

752
00:23:04,504 --> 00:23:06,478
(clapping)

753
00:23:06,478 --> 00:23:07,342
- She's

754
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:08,222
I really like her.

755
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:09,055
- She's awesome.

756
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:09,926
- I think she's got a real shot.

757
00:23:09,926 --> 00:23:10,759
- Yeah.

758
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:11,638
- Cool.

759
00:23:11,638 --> 00:23:12,526
I'll see you guys there.

760
00:23:12,526 --> 00:23:13,742
- Yeah.
- Yes.

761
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:14,575
- If I don't see you,

762
00:23:14,575 --> 00:23:15,408
have a great holiday.

763
00:23:15,408 --> 00:23:16,241
- We will see you, Gary!

764
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:17,574
- Alright, cool.

765
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:22,516
- [Man] Okay, so I have a question.

766
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:24,967
The Airplane

767
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:28,187
it's good because I understand what you're

768
00:23:28,187 --> 00:23:29,349
trying to do,

769
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:30,599
meaning, I love

770
00:23:31,867 --> 00:23:35,459
love how you're formulating
your thoughts throughout.

771
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:36,883
And

772
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,466
I'm trying to like,

773
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,218
it's very raw

774
00:23:41,218 --> 00:23:43,554
and I know you like that.

775
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:45,304
I know you like that.

776
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:47,039
- Go ahead.

777
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:47,872
Listen,

778
00:23:47,872 --> 00:23:49,402
moldable dictatorship.

779
00:23:49,402 --> 00:23:50,738
It's very raw.

780
00:23:50,738 --> 00:23:52,187
So raw that you don't think it can do

781
00:23:52,187 --> 00:23:53,462
as well as it can

782
00:23:53,462 --> 00:23:54,482
if we do something else.

783
00:23:54,482 --> 00:23:55,667
- You know what I love?

784
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,657
When you go on keynote,

785
00:23:57,657 --> 00:23:59,770
and exchanging your thoughts,

786
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:02,649
you have already thought about them.

787
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,673
And you're trying them out onto me.

788
00:24:04,673 --> 00:24:07,660
And you're testing them out.

789
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,409
This is that step where you're

790
00:24:09,409 --> 00:24:10,369
formulating them

791
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:11,242
- [Gary] Correct.

792
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,159
- [Man] And

793
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:14,690
I know the energy that you had on them,

794
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,874
I know it.

795
00:24:15,874 --> 00:24:17,157
I know you had the energy of like,

796
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:19,042
you need to get this to them

797
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,226
but you were just
formulating your thoughts.

798
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,059
- Great!

799
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:23,330
- And I love that!

800
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,290
But I don't think we
need 45 minutes of it.

801
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,467
- I think you're wrong!

802
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:27,300
- Okay.

803
00:24:28,452 --> 00:24:32,178
- We do what you're saying all the time.

804
00:24:32,178 --> 00:24:34,522
You have to have an off-speed pitch

805
00:24:34,522 --> 00:24:36,554
to set up your fast ball.

806
00:24:36,554 --> 00:24:39,272
Even if the project doesn't succeed,

807
00:24:39,272 --> 00:24:40,739
it's a success.

808
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:41,572
- Okay.

809
00:24:42,722 --> 00:24:44,754
You want me to cut it down at all?

810
00:24:44,754 --> 00:24:47,915
- (laughs) No!

811
00:24:47,915 --> 00:24:48,748
I understand, listen

812
00:24:48,748 --> 00:24:49,621
I remember
- I love you, man

813
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:50,835
I love

814
00:24:50,835 --> 00:24:52,023
- Listen!
- The creative process

815
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:52,856
I love it.

816
00:24:52,856 --> 00:24:53,689
- Guys!

817
00:24:53,689 --> 00:24:54,522
This is amazing.

818
00:24:54,522 --> 00:24:55,355
You have to understand,

819
00:24:55,355 --> 00:24:57,675
I for sure don't think
it's gonna go viral.

820
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:58,559
- No no no

821
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,579
- No no, I'm just talking,

822
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:00,461
I can't wait to hear what Andy says.

823
00:25:00,461 --> 00:25:01,961
I want it this way

824
00:25:04,227 --> 00:25:06,751
because I think of things
as a holistic thing,

825
00:25:06,751 --> 00:25:08,732
not in the silo.

826
00:25:08,732 --> 00:25:09,565
- [Andy] Yeah

827
00:25:09,565 --> 00:25:10,739
and I just want,

828
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:12,515
we need to package that.

829
00:25:12,515 --> 00:25:14,899
- That energy
- Your words,

830
00:25:14,899 --> 00:25:17,507
when it's released on the dot com.

831
00:25:17,507 --> 00:25:19,339
- Meaning
- Great!

832
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:20,172
Guess what?

833
00:25:20,172 --> 00:25:21,005
You just fuckin' recorded it!

834
00:25:21,005 --> 00:25:22,320
- Yeah, nah I know.

835
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,952
- So dear fuckin' fans

836
00:25:23,952 --> 00:25:26,564
- Do you want these 11 tracks?

837
00:25:26,564 --> 00:25:28,829
Do we definitely want them to be videos?

838
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:29,912
Versus audio?

839
00:25:30,793 --> 00:25:32,177
- Yes.

840
00:25:32,177 --> 00:25:33,538
- We definitely want them videos, okay.

841
00:25:33,538 --> 00:25:36,498
- We want video, audio
and the written word.

842
00:25:36,498 --> 00:25:37,331
I, listen,

843
00:25:37,331 --> 00:25:38,905
I totally get it.

844
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:41,505
If you think of it in the micro.

845
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:43,009
I think the macro of it

846
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:44,549
is what helps the overall thing.

847
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:46,585
- When D-Rock and I were talking,

848
00:25:46,585 --> 00:25:48,001
basically it's like,

849
00:25:48,001 --> 00:25:50,540
some of it's hard to watch.

850
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,373
And I was like

851
00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:52,206
- That's interesting,

852
00:25:52,206 --> 00:25:53,234
nobody's ever seen that from me!

853
00:25:53,234 --> 00:25:54,842
- It was like, yeah

854
00:25:54,842 --> 00:25:55,956
- That, that's how

855
00:25:55,956 --> 00:25:59,487
- That's his whole
theory about everything.

856
00:25:59,487 --> 00:26:00,651
- Like, this is to document

857
00:26:00,651 --> 00:26:03,251
- Great news, great news.

858
00:26:03,251 --> 00:26:04,084
Literally,

859
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,451
hey everybody,

860
00:26:06,451 --> 00:26:08,299
that's how we thought about
launching this project.

861
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:10,187
Here's your into to the
fuckin' Plane Project.

862
00:26:10,187 --> 00:26:11,854
I hope you enjoy it.

863
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,027
(hip hop music)

864
00:26:22,384 --> 00:26:24,717
(bell ding)

865
00:26:25,712 --> 00:26:26,720
- [Man] Do you have your company ID cards?

866
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,864
- Do you guys have your company ID's?

867
00:26:27,864 --> 00:26:29,361
- Well you're not getting
in because of the shirt.

868
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:30,464
- [Gary] I'm out?

869
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:31,297
(laughs)

870
00:26:31,297 --> 00:26:32,130
- [Bouncer] Yeah, you're out!

871
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:32,963
- I'm out?

872
00:26:33,838 --> 00:26:35,510
- Shit is un-fuckin'

873
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,654
(laughs)

874
00:26:36,654 --> 00:26:37,712
- You can't be mad at this!

875
00:26:37,712 --> 00:26:38,545
(laughs)

876
00:26:38,545 --> 00:26:39,918
The Jets don't bother anybody!

877
00:26:39,918 --> 00:26:40,751
- You're good.

878
00:26:40,751 --> 00:26:41,584
- Thank you, brother.

879
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:42,417
What up, brother?

880
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:43,870
- You got the wristbands?

881
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,478
- Nah.

882
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,254
- [Gary] Do not let this
guy in the red hat in.

883
00:26:47,254 --> 00:26:48,823
(laughs)
Thank you.

884
00:26:48,823 --> 00:26:51,990
(music and audience talking)

885
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,823
Thank you.

886
00:26:52,823 --> 00:26:53,656
- Would you like some drink?

887
00:26:53,656 --> 00:26:54,906
- No thank you.

888
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,558
Is this where the VIP's hang out?

889
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:00,391
