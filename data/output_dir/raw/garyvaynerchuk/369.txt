1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,035
- [Man] Can you sign my,--

2
00:00:01,035 --> 00:00:03,250
- Yes, hold on, I promise I will
get to every single person.

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,500
You'll send me an
email, DRock, no?

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,208
All right, good, I'm
just gonna put this here,

5
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:09,166
nobody break my
wine, it's a nice gift.

6
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:12,166
All right,
you'll take this picture

7
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,166
and you'll
email Gary@VaynerMedia

8
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:16,458
and then you'll put
French subtitles in the title,

9
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:17,417
subject line, and
I'll get it organized.

10
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:18,417
- All right, no problem.

11
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:19,667
- How is everybody, good?

12
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:21,625
- [All] Yeah!

13
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,083
- Let's do it.

14
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:25,166
- [Man] How was the food?

15
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,041
- Food was
fuckin' ridiculously good.

16
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,375
(group laughter)
And I'm a snobby,

17
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,667
- [Man] How was the wine though?

18
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:32,040
- The wine was really good
too, I'm a snobby New Yorker

19
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,750
and that was really good.
- Yeah.

20
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,708
- Really good, has
anybody ever eaten here?

21
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,041
- Yeah.

22
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,834
- [Gary] It's
fancy though, right?

23
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:40,583
You're a fancy dude huh?

24
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,166
- No, I live here.

25
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,333
- Just kidding, awesome.

26
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:46,000
- [Man] It takes four
months before you can eat.

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,375
- All right here's
my concept for this

28
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:51,208
so I can get through this,
let's just first do selfies

29
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,750
and sign books, and
then we can do questions,

30
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,458
because otherwise
people would have to wait

31
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,834
like four, five hours,
and I've done this before.

32
00:00:57,834 --> 00:00:59,000
So let's first do
the photos and things

33
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,250
of that nature and then
I'll try to answer questions

34
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,083
if I can after.

35
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,750
(upbeat music)

36
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,542
Real pleasure.

37
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:07,625
- [Man 2] Who is the
best NBA player ever?

38
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,000
- [Gary] Who is the
best NBA player ever?

39
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,083
- [Man 2] Yeah.
- Patrick Ewing.

40
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,667
You're not recording.

41
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:16,417
(all laughing)
Best NBA player

42
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:18,208
is Patrick Ewing,
'cause I'm a Knicks fan,

43
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:21,166
and that's who I say.

44
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,417
Real pleasure
man, thanks for coming.

45
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:24,875
- [Man 3] Something to
tell to businesspeople?

46
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,792
- Reverse engineer yourself,
don't try to be somebody else,

47
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:31,041
not for your parents, not for
me, not for him, for yourself.

48
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,375
- [Man 3] Thanks Gary.
- You got it.

49
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:33,125
Where were you before?

50
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,166
- In Curacao, in the Caribbean.

51
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:38,125
My dad lives there,
but I want to sell stuff

52
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:42,125
and make money, but my
market lives in the U.S.

53
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:42,792
- [Gary] Okay.

54
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,875
- [Man 4] How can
I do that best?

55
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,250
- [Gary] Well what
do you want to sell?

56
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,375
- [Man] T-shirts, and it's
gonna be fishing T-shirts,

57
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,750
and so it needs to
be higher performance,

58
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,083
and they're not gonna
find 'em here, only in the U.S.

59
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,667
- [Gary] Okay, so
why can't you set up,--

60
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:55,959
- [Man 4] 'Cause I don't
have a friend or a cousin

61
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:59,208
or brother in the U.S.
that can hold 1,000 T-shirts

62
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,208
in his room for me,
- [Gary] You shouldn't do that,

63
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,333
you should sell them on spec.

64
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,041
- [Man 5] You're the
one who made me shift

65
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,834
towards gratitude
in my business.

66
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:09,125
- Funny thing happens
when you make that move.

67
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,959
- [Man 5] True right?

68
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,000
- All these things are
switches, everybody wants

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,959
these little things,
they're binary,

70
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,375
you're either on or you're
off. There is no half-pregnant.

71
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,708
- [Man 5] The process.
- It's a process.

72
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,917
- [Man 6] So my question is
actually this, I have an idea

73
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:25,708
and I'm really into it, I
really want to work for it.

74
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,792
But my question is, the
only thing that I'm missing

75
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:29,834
is actually a
good financial base,

76
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:32,792
I know how to get it,
but how can I work it

77
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:35,458
in that way that I still
have something to say

78
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,959
in my own idea,
the best possible way?

79
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,125
- Well if you
don't have the money,

80
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,583
and if you raise the money,
you don't have the say,

81
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:43,708
then you have to
wait until you have

82
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,917
the money to have the say.
- [Man 6] That's the best

83
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:47,083
and only way.
- It's the only way,

84
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,542
if you want to have say,
unless you decide this idea

85
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:51,500
is worth you learning from.

86
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,417
The biggest problem
everybody here is gonna make

87
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:56,583
is they think their current
idea is the end-all, be-all,

88
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:59,750
a lot of your businesses and
ideas are stepping stones.

89
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,083
so maybe it's better
for you to not have say,

90
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,667
learn what's good, learn
what's bad, you're a young man.

91
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:05,959
- [Man 6] I'll tell you what,
- You know what's great

92
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,917
about being a businessman,
is you don't retire at 31

93
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:10,959
like an athlete,
you play forever.

94
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,000
So instead of waiting
until you make the money

95
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,750
to have control, maybe it's
better to not have control,

96
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,375
you learn, it sucks
'cause you don't have control,

97
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,792
but you learn, maybe
you'll make some money

98
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:23,000
and then you can take the money
and go do your next thing.

99
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,375
You're always gonna have ideas,
this isn't your first idea.

100
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,208
- [Man 6] That's true.
- Got it?

101
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,417
Don't fall in love with an idea.

102
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,208
- [Man 6] Okay exactly.

103
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,166
Thank you man.
- You're welcome.

104
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,792
- [Man 7] I want to say to you
that if today I stand there,

105
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:36,708
it's because of one guy,
who is behind you,

106
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,500
who gut trusted what you said,

107
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,917
that you have to cut
friends from your inner circle

108
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:42,750
to succeed,
- Yes, yes.

109
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,000
- And today I know
that I'll achieve greatness

110
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,667
because I will show
him that you have not

111
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:50,083
to cut friends to make it.
- I love it man,

112
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,875
well good, like too many
people try to make a narrative.

113
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,625
The only narrative that
works is your true narrative.

114
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,583
So many people here fronting
as experts or as coaches

115
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,583
and making stuff
happen, you're aspiring,

116
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,417
you're through the process,
document your best story

117
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:06,041
that will get people to buy
more jewelry than anything

118
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,708
is that you guys
come out and say,

119
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,542
we're just starting,
we don't know shit,

120
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:11,500
we just know that we want to
put this out in the world.

121
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,792
People will relate to that more

122
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:14,583
than you saying,
we're this, we're that.

123
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,708
Got it?
- [Woman] Yes.

124
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,666
- The truth always wins.

125
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,333
- [Women] Okay.

126
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,166
- It might not be
winning this moment, this month,

127
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,750
this year, but it
always wins at the end.

128
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,458
- I'm a radio host at one

129
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,792
of the national
radio studio Brussels.

130
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:27,500
- Okay.

131
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,000
- And I'm a
high school drop out.

132
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,708
- Vlog.

133
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,291
- I quit high
school when I was 17.

134
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:33,959
- Yep.

135
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,375
- Now I'm just
chasing my career,

136
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,417
trying to do
some shit, you know.

137
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:37,041
- Yep.

138
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,834
- [Man 9] But I see a lot
of kids right now.

139
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:39,792
- I'm listening to you.

140
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:42,000
- [Man 9] What you see right
now is maybe zero point zero

141
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,959
one percent of people
that chase their dreams.

142
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,959
- Right. 
- What I want to

143
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,792
do is I wanna start 
like a sort of YouTube show.

144
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:48,458
- Okay.

145
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,083
- To interviewing
like celebrities.

146
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:50,917
- Okay.

147
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:52,083
- About following their dreams.

148
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:52,917
- Okay.

149
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,542
- Inspire a lot of
people here, youngsters.

150
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:55,375
- Okay.

151
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,208
- Like me.

152
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,458
But how do I brand
something like this.

153
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,417
I know through
YouTube, but how do I

154
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:03,166
use Twitter, Instagram, Facebook
up to its full potential

155
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,750
to just grow it as,

156
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,458
you know what I mean.

157
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,041
- Of course I know.

158
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,458
It's the
quality of your content.

159
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,959
- Is it only the content?

160
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,542
- And it's the tactics.

161
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:15,250
So the tactics are free.

162
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,291
You can by Jab Jab Jab
Gray Hook for 12 bucks.

163
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,125
- Okay.

164
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,792
- And fuckin', I
told you the tactics.

165
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:23,000
The number one thing
everybody should do here

166
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,583
is not listen
to what I'm saying,

167
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,208
they should watch what I do.

168
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,000
You wanna be big on
all these platforms,

169
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,208
just look at my behavior.

170
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,083
The problem is everybody
wants it to happen too fast.

171
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,250
- Yeah.

172
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,125
- The question
isn't how do you do it.

173
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,417
The question that
people really mean

174
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:38,208
is how do I do it faster?

175
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,041
The answer is you don't.

176
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:39,875
- Yeah.

177
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,792
- Your upside is
gonna be predicated

178
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:43,375
on how good you actually are.

179
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,500
- Okay.
- The end.

180
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,333
- Okay.

181
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,291
- Like what do you
do, you put it out.

182
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,125
Use hashtags.

183
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,708
You do, everybody
does the same shit.

184
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:52,000
- Yeah well these small
things like hashtags and stuff

185
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,375
that I don't know anything
about, I'm trying to learn.

186
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,458
- It's called Google.

187
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,500
(group laughter) 
I'm being serious with you.

188
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,542
- Or a code here right now.

189
00:05:58,542 --> 00:05:59,417
- It's called Google man.

190
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:00,250
Just go to Google and be like

191
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,375
how do I use hashtags
to grow my Instagram?

192
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,750
And there's 4,000 articles.

193
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,750
- Yeah, but the thing is hashtag
is just an example for you.

194
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,750
- No, no, no.
That's one of the examples.

195
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,041
- Yeah, exactly
one of the examples.

196
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,125
- The real question everybody
asks is how to do it faster

197
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,708
and the answer is
there's no faster.

198
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,500
You'll get there
based on your talent.

199
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,875
If you're
ridiculously fuckin' hot,

200
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,708
all these fuckin'
dudes will follow you.

201
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:19,542
- You think?

202
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:21,291
- Sure. Hot chicks
win on Instagram.

203
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,792
(group laughter)

204
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:25,500
If you're ridiculously
smart and you're great

205
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,667
and motivational and understand
what the fuck you're saying,

206
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:28,750
all these dudes will watch it.

207
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,750
That's what happens with me.

208
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,583
- Okay.
(group laughter)

209
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,333
- Like you've gotta have it.

210
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,625
- The thing is like
the only thing that I have,

211
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,834
the only doubt is the States.

212
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:38,458
I know the mindset of the states

213
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,000
is really different
as the mindset here.

214
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,959
People here are afraid
to take risks, to go out it.

215
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,750
- YouTube isn't Belgium only.

216
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,000
- [Man 10] True, but--
- But what?

217
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,166
- I wanna try to tackle
people from Belgium first.

218
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,625
- [Gary] Great, well
then you can't be mad

219
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,834
at Belgium's mindset if
you want to sell to Belgium.

220
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,500
- Do you believe that
I can change a mindset?

221
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,750
- I believe you
can change a mindset

222
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,291
over a course of a lifetime.

223
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,792
But not in two years.

224
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:03,625
And not in five years -

225
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,458
- [Man 10] Of course,
no I have patience.

226
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,083
I have to.
- So sure.

227
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,959
But European DNA is structured.

228
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,834
Europe's where it's at.

229
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:12,208
If you're the
greatest of all time.

230
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,917
If you're Mohammad Ali
or Martin Luther King,

231
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:14,750
I think you're gonna change it.

232
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,834
If not you can't.
- I believe I can be that.

233
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:16,792
- Well then do it.
- Okay.

234
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:18,083
- Martin Luther King 
and Mohammad Ali

235
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,333
didn't come and ask me to do it.

236
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,041
- [Man 11] What are the three
most important business

237
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,125
for you to start a business?

238
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:26,792
- I mean, you
have to have skill.

239
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:28,083
You have to be patient.

240
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,125
You have to have a
product that people want.

241
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,375
You have to be
good at marketing.

242
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,041
You have to be good at people.

243
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:37,417
My man, 99% of everybody's
businesses here will fail.

244
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:38,917
We're living in
fake entrepreneur land

245
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:39,959
and everybody
thinks it's so easy.

246
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,792
It's hard.

247
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:42,083
Everybody can
be an entrepreneur.

248
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,208
You can have a business.

249
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,708
Can you live on it
for the rest of your life?

250
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,208
That's a whole different game.

251
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,417
So I mean the
thought of even asking,

252
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:54,917
like even the question speaks
to like raw young, you know?

253
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:56,792
Like there's a
million ways to win.

254
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:59,583
You're the smartest,
you're the hardest working.

255
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,083
You saw white space
that nobody else saw.

256
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,250
There's no right answer there's

257
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,333
just a million ways to do it.

258
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,959
You need to figure
out what works for you.

259
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,834
- [Man 12] I'm basically
being bullshitting

260
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:08,166
the last two years,
and I just wanna know

261
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,750
of some pep talks, some
great motivational things

262
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,000
to just get me started tomorrow.

263
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,166
'Cause I just had
been not doing anything

264
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,542
that I should have been doing,

265
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:17,417
'cause I just
have so many doubts,

266
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,583
and I just think too much
of what other people feel,

267
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,458
will think of my thing.

268
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,417
'Cause I know
the thing I wanna do.

269
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:25,166
I already started
my YouTube channel up,

270
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,875
I already know
what I have to do,

271
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:30,875
I know your ethos
of document and create,

272
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:31,708
so I know what I have to do.

273
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,041
- [Gary] You're not there yet.

274
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:33,875
- Yeah, I'm not there.

275
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:34,707
- [Gary] You're not there yet.

276
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:35,542
- I just need that last push--

277
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:38,417
- You know, you're here
because you know I'm right.

278
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,457
- Yeah, of course, yeah.

279
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:41,291
- I can say it, like
maybe tonight's the night

280
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,457
where I'm like, just do it,

281
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:43,500
fuck them.
- Yeah, yeah.

282
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,583
- But the truth is, even if
you feel the high from me,

283
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,041
like, if I miraculously
came up with an amazing thing

284
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,125
to say to you right now,

285
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,875
the truth is, next Thursday
happens and I'm not here.

286
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,250
- I see.
- So what I would say is,

287
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,959
the fact that you
even know I'm right,

288
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,000
so you have to understand,

289
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,166
the reason people leave
negative comments on me,

290
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,417
or they don't like me,

291
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:04,125
some people here
didn't like me at first,

292
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:07,708
is because I'm not letting you
get away with your bullshit.

293
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,208
- Okay.
- I'm getting the point of it,

294
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,083
and the people
that don't like me

295
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,625
are the ones that
wanna pay other people,

296
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,959
or want other people
that show them Lamborghinis

297
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:16,708
or watches, they
wanna trick them.

298
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,917
They wanna trick them
into feeling good.

299
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:21,125
There's only work.

300
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,750
There's only not caring
about everybody else.

301
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,125
You know what to do,
you grew up in a way,

302
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,125
environment, parents, DNA,

303
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,458
that hasn't let
you get there yet.

304
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,750
But the fact
that you're even here,

305
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,792
and you basically said
what you have to do to me.

306
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:34,667
- Yeah.
- I didn't say anything.

307
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:35,458
- No, I know, yeah.

308
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,708
- It's just a
matter of time now.

309
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:37,542
- Yeah.
- What you need to do

310
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:39,291
is keep pressure on it.

311
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,000
The reason I never
change my tune,

312
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,834
is the reason I'm
getting so many people

313
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:45,875
to do things, is
'cause I don't waver.

314
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,333
It's constant offense.

315
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,834
I'm gonna pound you everyday,

316
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:51,500
everyday, multiple times a day,

317
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,250
with the same fucking
thing, it never changes,

318
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,917
it's the same thing.

319
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:57,000
Luckily for me,
there's new platforms,

320
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,625
so it feels like
I'm saying something new

321
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,041
'cause shit's changing.

322
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,417
But it's the same thing.

323
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,875
It's the same thing, and you'll
just eventually get there.

324
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,542
What you need to do is you
need to keep paying attention

325
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:08,750
to people like me, or
others that sound like me,

326
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,750
so that it becomes your norm.

327
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,875
It becomes your oxygen.

328
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:12,875
There is no other voices,

329
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,792
and eventually, just
like when you jumped off

330
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:18,208
a diving board to a pool,

331
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,041
just like when you kiss
somebody for the first time,

332
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,708
just like anything
else you ever did in life,

333
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,250
eventually you get
there and you do it,

334
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,834
and you never look back.
- Okay.

335
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,375
- You understand?
- Yeah, okay, thank you.

336
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,542
- So the key is
to suffocate yourself

337
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:33,792
into pressuring yourself
to have no other options.

338
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:34,458
- 'Kay.

339
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,667
- The reason I'm
worth listening to,

340
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,375
is 'cause I'll do that for you,

341
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,750
and then you
don't need me anymore.

342
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,708
- Okay, thank you.

343
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:40,542
Thank you very much, yeah.
- Yeah.

344
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:41,333
I don't need to
sell you anything.

345
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,000
- No.

346
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,166
Can you do just one?
- I don't want you

347
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,083
to stay around.

348
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,041
- I just want
one favor from you,

349
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,458
- Yeah?
- Can you just scream

350
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,542
in my face, just fucking do it?

351
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:49,583
- I don't even wanna do that,

352
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,417
'cause--

353
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,250
- Please, I just want that boost

354
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,125
to just do it, yeah.
- I'll tell you what.

355
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:52,875
I'll tell you what.
I don't want to,

356
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:53,708
Cause I don't feel it's right,

357
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:54,667
you know why?
- Why not?

358
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,333
- 'Cause it's tactical.

359
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,500
- But it's just a
mental thing, I think.

360
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,291
I just--
- No.

361
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,125
- I just wanna get that trigger.
- You want me

362
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,250
to fix the sink?
I want you to fix your well.

363
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,792
- [Man 12] Damn.

364
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:03,375
- You understand?
- Yeah.

365
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,708
- You just want me to
fix your sink right now.

366
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:05,667
- Yeah.
- I don't want to do that.

367
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:06,875
You already know the answer.

368
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,208
My screaming in your
face will be a fun moment,

369
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,041
- Yeah.
- It'll be cool

370
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:10,959
to think back to.
- Yeah.

371
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,375
- It's not what
you need right now.

372
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,959
What you need is
constant pressure

373
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,041
on any voice
that's penetrating you

374
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,750
that isn't allowing
you to make that jump.

375
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,417
Whether that's your
mom, or older brother,

376
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,625
or your aunt, or your
best friend, or you girlfriend,

377
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,959
or your boyfriend, I don't
know who the fuck that is,

378
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:25,083
but you need to eliminate it.

379
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,291
- Okay.
- You don't have to cut them

380
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,917
out like that.

381
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:29,500
When I say cut friendship out,

382
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,083
I mean, I have
friends that I don't listen

383
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,208
to a fuckin' word they say.

384
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,333
They're my friends,

385
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,875
but I don't take
their words as my gospel.

386
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,834
You know what
to do, I heard you.

387
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:40,875
That's why I'm not
gonna give it to you.

388
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:41,583
I heard you,
- Yeah.

389
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,083
- I know you're ready.
- Yeah.

390
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,291
- You know what you are?

391
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,625
(tapping)
Just a matter of time.

392
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,333
- [Man 13] How, how
do you meet investors?

393
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,792
- How do you meet investors?
- Yes.

394
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,041
- You go to angellist.com, you
get a list of all the people,

395
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,625
and you message them.

396
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,041
And 99% of them
will say no, and four,

397
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,708
four of them will say yes.

398
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,333
And you'll learn
from those experiences.

399
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,166
- [Man 13] Thank you so much.

400
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,125
- You just keep asking.

401
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,875
- We have a platform.

402
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,625
It's like the mini
Google of online shopping.

403
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,333
- Okay.

404
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,458
So Google makes money
when you buy something,

405
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,792
they get a commission,
but they don't share it.

406
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:13,417
You understand it, but, in
Belgium, people don't get it,

407
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:15,417
in Europe, no one gets it.

408
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:18,208
So, when you log
onto this, you register,

409
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,834
you just buy our shit,
then you get a commission.

410
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:22,917
But we share the
commission with users.

411
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:25,875
- Yeah, but Google
brings them value otherwise.

412
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,500
- Yes, but,
- Google does other things

413
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,792
besides just sell them things.

414
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:31,834
- Of course, but our problem
is that people don't understand

415
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,250
that they can get a
percentage back of their--

416
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,917
- Earnings, of their buying,
- their earnings,

417
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:41,041
so how do we promote,
how do we market the platform?

418
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,542
- You get in front of them.

419
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:44,708
- But,--
- But how do you do that, right?

420
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,667
- So now we
start with influencers?

421
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:47,834
- Yep, that's good.
- And then we make

422
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,792
a personal landing page,
- Yep.

423
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:51,000
- They put it in
their instagram bio,

424
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,250
- That's a good start.

425
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,834
- We make a picture,
from that, they say,--

426
00:12:53,834 --> 00:12:55,917
- That's a good start.

427
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:57,959
- Then, the force
of the influencers,

428
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,291
they get 10 Euro as a bonus,
- I get it.

429
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,583
- It's all great,
but how should we do it,

430
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,917
- At scale?
- How do we sell our story?

431
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,166
Because no one gets it,
that's the problem, man.

432
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,208
- You should make a
video and explain it.

433
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:14,000
- But we already
tried it, and, in Belgium,

434
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,125
if I ask here, maybe, how often

435
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,708
did people know that
Google earn via commission?

436
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,792
- Well Google
earns commission through,

437
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:23,166
what are you talking
about, Google Shopping?

438
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,000
- Also yeah, but what
we do is, so you log in,

439
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,208
you go to your Amazon,
you buy, and then you get

440
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,166
a percentage back.
- I know what he's doing,

441
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,583
okay.
- But here in Belgium

442
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,000
and in Europe it's,

443
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,041
- Who in the U.S. is
doing it successfully?

444
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,041
- The platform
that we built, no one.

445
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,959
- Think about that for a minute.

446
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:43,875
- You have cash backs.
- Think about that

447
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,750
for a minute, give that thought.

448
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,000
You know what I mean?

449
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,917
To me, incentivize back,--
- I am the marketer, so,

450
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:51,166
- Respect.
- We are the agency,

451
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,792
- I get it, they're the client.

452
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,875
- And he drove me
with the cab on his cost,

453
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,000
just to ask you his question.

454
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,208
- The problem is,
when you do incentivized,

455
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,583
commission-based affiliate
cash back buying,

456
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,333
it's never worked,
'cause it's not enough

457
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,875
of a value prop to them,

458
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:09,125
they can get that
from American Express.

459
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,000
It's just not a
valuable enough product.

460
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,667
The reason I asked
you who in the U.S. does it,

461
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:16,041
you're blaming it on
Belgium, how about the U.S.?

462
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,250
The most
progressive market in the world,

463
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,083
where is it happening,
China, the most progressive,

464
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,041
the model doesn't work.
- Your advice to your

465
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,458
21-year-old self is,
date more chicks,

466
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,834
have more fun, how do
you balance it with hustle?

467
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:32,667
- I didn't balance it,
I worked every minute.

468
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,208
- How would you
balance it though?

469
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,542
- In hindsight?
- Yes.

470
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,708
- How would you do it?
- Maybe one,

471
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,792
maybe two weekends a
year, it wouldn't be that much.

472
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,208
I'm pretty happy
with the way it is.

473
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:46,333
Look, people's mouths
are way ahead and ambitions

474
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,708
are way ahead of their actions,
everybody is talking shit,

475
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,667
but people aren't
putting in the work.

476
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:54,125
By the way, by the way--
- But if that's your goal,

477
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,333
- Exactly, do you know
how great it is to make

478
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,959
$100,000 a year and be
happy and go on vacation

479
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,458
and love your life, it's
great, everybody now thinks

480
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,708
they have to build
Facebook, it's stupid.

481
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:04,417
- Exactly.

482
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:05,125
- You just need
to know yourself,

483
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,208
you don't need to be me,
- I'm getting started

484
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,417
at 28--
- You could start at 58.

485
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:10,458
- And building
million dollar businesses?

486
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,917
- Of course,
Kentucky Fried Chicken,

487
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:13,583
the guy was 75
years old when he started.

488
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,834
Do whatever the
fuck you want, I dunno,

489
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:16,333
what do you wanna do?

490
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:16,959
- [Man 14] I, I,
like you, like you.

491
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:17,625
- You're not sure?

492
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,125
You wanna be like me,
then you need to start

493
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,500
putting in work

494
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,291
and start selling stuff,
you know, like, you should--

495
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,000
- And how, how do you do that?

496
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,625
- Well I, the way
I did it at your age

497
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,959
was I didn't give a shit about
school, I got bad grades,

498
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,667
I spent all my time
on building a business

499
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:30,750
I didn't go out with my friends,

500
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,250
I didn't play video games,
I didn't hook up with girls,

501
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,125
I fucking worked.

502
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,291
- [Man 14] But that, what do you
mean by building a business?

503
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,583
- My plan back then was
everybody was collecting

504
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,083
baseball cards and comic books,

505
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,625
so I was buying
baseball cards and comic books

506
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,667
and selling it back to them.

507
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:44,500
- Okay, that's work.

508
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,333
- [Man 15] Hm-mm, should be
fine now.

509
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,542
- [Gary] You know, you're doing
exactly like, oh fuck, guys,

510
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:50,333
if you think I did
well (laughing) now,

511
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,667
if I grew up in the era,
that you're growing up in,

512
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:54,834
this shit would have
been over a long time ago.

513
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:55,959
(group laughter)

514
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:58,166
If I had eBay and
Shopify and Google

515
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,041
and fucking the
internet, I didn't have shit,

516
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,417
there was no computers.

517
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:04,291
Fucking went to the
store, or bought shit. Love it.

518
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,333
Bought shit, went to
the flea market on Saturday

519
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,542
and sold it like, shit like,
you guys have it so good,

520
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:10,375
so easy.

521
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,208
- [Man 16] You should come to--

522
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,291
- You have it so good, so easy,

523
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,583
that it tricks
you that it's easy.

524
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,959
- [Man 15] That's the problem.

525
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,000
- It's so good and so easy,
that you're getting tricked--

526
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,875
- [Man 15] Mhmmm.
- that it's easy, it's not easy.

527
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:24,166
- [Woman 2] What do your
wife do to make you possible

528
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,667
to do what you do?

529
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,458
- She supports
me unconditionally

530
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,417
at her own expense.

531
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:31,583
- [Woman 2] Yeah,
because my husband is the better

532
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,708
entrepreneur of the two of us,
- Yes.

533
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:34,959
- [Woman 2] And I want to
support him all the way,

534
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,041
but what do I have
to do to make him--

535
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,000
- You have to become
independent and selfless.

536
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,667
- [Woman 2] Okay.
- But that's very hard.

537
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,500
- Yeah.

538
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,333
- That's easy
for me to say to you.

539
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,166
- Yeah.

540
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,000
- It's hard to actually do it.
- [Woman 2] Mhmmm.

541
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,291
- You know, my wife
is a special person.

542
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,500
You know, it's,
she's a special person.

543
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,959
- [Woman 2] Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

544
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,917
- To be in a place where
- [Woman 2] I do.

545
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:54,708
- Where she supports the
insanity, that I execute.

546
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:55,542
- [Woman 2] Yeah.

547
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:57,291
- That takes
enormous confidence.

548
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,041
It takes enormous,
enormous humility,

549
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,917
selfishness and, and, and...

550
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:06,000
it takes a lot of independence.

551
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,125
She doesn't need me at all
- [Woman 2] Okay.

552
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,208
- for her happiness.
- [Woman 2] Yeah, yeah.

553
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,165
- That's hard when you're
sharing a life with somebody.

554
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:12,000
- [Woman 2] Yeah.

555
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,500
- So, and what that
does is it guilts me

556
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,708
into spending more
time, you know, it's,

557
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:15,540
- [Woman 2] Mhmmm..

558
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,833
- You give you get, right?
- [Woman 2] Yeah.

559
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:19,540
- I'm almost graduating as an
electrical engineer this year

560
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,665
and I realized I
actually hate it.

561
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,874
- Yes.
(laughs)

562
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,290
- It's very common.
- Yes.

563
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,959
- So I actually want to get
into the cosmetic industry.

564
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:26,790
- Awesome.

565
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,749
- And developing products
- Yes.

566
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,583
- And making
- Amazing.

567
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,542
- But it's more in the
chemical engineering--

568
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:31,375
- Yes.

569
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,875
- industry, so now I'm
wondering what should I do

570
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,291
to emerge that industry?

571
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:37,041
- I would email
every single Head of R&amp;D

572
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:40,500
of every cosmetic
business in the world

573
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,333
- Yes.

574
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,041
- and tell them your story.

575
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,041
- Alright, and see what
they answer and--

576
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,875
- If you email
1700 people on Linkedin

577
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,959
and tell them
your story, (laughs)

578
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:51,083
- all you need is one to say,--
- One to say yes.

579
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,000
- "You know what, I like
the way you emailed me."

580
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,834
- Okay.

581
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:54,959
- You understand?
- Yes, I do.

582
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:55,917
- It's practical.
- Yeah.

583
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:56,875
- You know what's the problem?

584
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,291
Everybody's debating.
- Yeah.

585
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,333
- People don't understand
there's value in doing.

586
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,583
You can
change two years later.

587
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,458
- Yeah, I did.

588
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,542
- There's no losing.

589
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:04,542
- [Gary] Every, yeah, now...

590
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,041
The only form of losing
is sitting and debating.

591
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:07,875
- Yeah, yeah.

592
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,375
- [Gary] It means you're
not doing anything.

593
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,208
- Sure.

594
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,458
Yeah, just working--

595
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,500
- [Gary] What do you like?

596
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,959
- I do like repairing,
- Good, good.

597
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,500
- like trains, for example.
- Good. (crowd laughing)

598
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,500
- Okay, thank you, man.

599
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,333
- You got it. (group laughter)

600
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,083
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

601
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,291
- [Man 16] How do you choose,
if you have different

602
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,667
passions,
you're always saying--

603
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:23,500
- You pick one.

604
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,166
- [Man 16] Only one? 
- Right.

605
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,291
- Focus in on one, not ten?
- Yes.

606
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,166
You can focus on ten.
It's hard.

607
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,250
- [Man 16] Okay.

608
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,083
- You might be talented enough.

609
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,041
(group laughter)

610
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,000
- [Gary] I don't know.

611
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,542
- Okay, but you
say focus on one,

612
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:36,000
- [Gary] It's only,
it's only doing.

613
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,166
Doing is the,
I got it, doing is the,

614
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,291
doing is the only thing.

615
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,792
- [Man 17] The cover,
the cover.

616
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:41,625
- Cover.
- [Man 17] Yeah.

617
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,333
- [Gary] Doing is
the only thing.

618
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,208
It's the only
thing that matters.

619
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,792
It's the only, like,
everybody's pondering.

620
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:49,417
By the way, guys,
you've been living

621
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:52,834
under very good economic times.

622
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:56,750
The economy's been good over
the last seven to ten years,

623
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,291
like six, seven, eight years.

624
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,875
What do you think's going to
happen to all your businesses,

625
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,208
when the economy goes bad?

626
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,959
And there's no funding,
and there's no customers?

627
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:06,291
Go ask all the retailers what
happened to their business

628
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,083
here, after the
bombing at your airport?

629
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,875
Like, what do you think, like,
you guys have had it good.

630
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,417
You're young, you
haven't had it bad.

631
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:16,583
Everybody's
pondering and creating CEO

632
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,166
in their Instagram title.

633
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,375
(group laughter)

634
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:23,208
- Like, like,
wait till shit is hard.

635
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,875
Wait 'til shit is
hard and there's no money.

636
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,250
You're gonna go get a job.

637
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,667
So, while it's good right now,

638
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,625
it's a really bad
strategy to just debate,

639
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,542
because by the
time you figure it out,

640
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:34,583
the market's gonna suck

641
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,959
and there's gonna be
no customers to be had

642
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:38,208
and it doesn't matter
that you figured it out.

643
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,542
- [Man 17] So currently, I'm,
I'm discussing

644
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:42,125
with a startup to
help them with their growth.

645
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:42,959
- Okay.

646
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,792
- [Man 17] We set some--
- Sorry, man.

647
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,083
- [Man 17] Yeah,
some really good growth goals.

648
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,750
- Yep.

649
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,250
- [Man 17] So they
really want some leads,

650
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,041
some conversions,
it's really clear to them.

651
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:51,708
- Okay.

652
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:52,959
- [Man 17] But I'm
really scared

653
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,792
that I can't experiment,

654
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,333
because I would like
to do content marketing,

655
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,458
experiment with
things, like Musical.ly.

656
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,291
- Yep.

657
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,083
- [Man 17] Because
it's really each group is--

658
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:01,917
- Pictures.

659
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:02,750
- [Man 17]
between 12 and 16,

660
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,583
- Fine.

661
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,834
- [Man 17] but the group
goals are too tight.

662
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:07,542
- So don't do it.

663
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:09,583
- [Man 17] But I have to
earn some money.

664
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,083
- So go find somebody
else to do something with.

665
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,542
- [Man 17] Okay,
and would you discuss--

666
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:13,792
- Or tell them the truth.

667
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:15,208
- [Man 17] Yeah, would you
discuss with them?

668
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,417
- The one thing
I would never do in life

669
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:20,041
is do something that is
already a losing proposition

670
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,375
before you started.
- [Man 17] Yeah.

671
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,542
- That's what
you're coming to me?

672
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:24,708
- [Man 17] Yeah, I told
them you have the brand,

673
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,291
and you have like,
leads and the sales marketing.

674
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,750
- Yeah, I understand
what you're saying.

675
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,917
- [Man 17] And they
were like, okay, but--

676
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:31,125
- You want, you
want to do branding

677
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,083
and they want to do conversion?

678
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,792
You wanna do a mix of
branding and conversion?

679
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:35,625
- Yeah, yeah.
- Picture?

680
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,708
- Yeah, video picture.

681
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,542
- Yep.

682
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:38,375
- [Man 17] But what if you do

683
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,917
only the leads
and the conversions,

684
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:41,375
you don't have a brand.

685
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,250
- That's right.

686
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,959
So, you either tell them
- [Man 17] Yeah.

687
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,834
I told them and they were like,

688
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:47,500
"Yeah, we can build a brand

689
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,583
"while doing the
leads and the conversions,"

690
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,417
and I told them--

691
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,792
- Sounds, sounds like you
need to find somebody else

692
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,625
to do business with.

693
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:53,458
- [Man 17] Okay.

694
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,875
- What, are these the only
fucking people in the world

695
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:55,708
you can do business with?

696
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:56,542
- [Man 17] No, no, no, no.

697
00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:57,417
- Well so, go find fucking
people to do business with.

698
00:20:57,417 --> 00:20:59,959
- [Man 17] Alright, okay.

699
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,792
- [Gary] You either
compromise, or you don't.

700
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:02,875
- [Man 17] Yeah.

701
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,375
- I've won on not compromising,

702
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,542
'cause I'm good enough.

703
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:07,250
My man, you're
walking into dog shit.

704
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:07,917
- [Man 17] Okay.

705
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:09,250
- You're walking
into a straight loss.

706
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,792
- [Man 17] Okay.
- Get the fuck outta there.

707
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:13,375
- [Man 17] Get another,
another startup to help?

708
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,208
- Yeah.

709
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,000
- I just need three words
for there being a good CEO.

710
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,917
- Okay.
- And I wanted to take--

711
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:18,917
- You got it.

712
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:20,542
- Give me three words.

713
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:21,583
- You

714
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:22,500
work

715
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,583
for them.

716
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,583
(group laughter)

717
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,417
- Sure.
- [Gary] That's leadership.

718
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:27,250
- Yeah, I know.

719
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,750
- [Gary] Everybody wants to
be the CEO and they think

720
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,500
that people work for them.

721
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,166
A CEO works for the people.

722
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,500
- Yeah, I know, it's true.

723
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,667
- [Gary] That's got
people confused.

724
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:35,500
- Really?

725
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,959
- Yes, all the
pressure's on you.

726
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:39,041
It's your fault, it's on you.

727
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,625
- Do you believe in what you do?

728
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,500
Like 100%?

729
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,333
- 100%.

730
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,333
- Okay, I really wanted to--
- Like 100%.

731
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,959
- Nice man,
I really appreciate it.

732
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:46,792
- Awesome.

733
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:48,500
- [Man 18] Should I built
my business on the side.

734
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,417
or take a gap year
and try to launch it.

735
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:51,250
- Both work.

736
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,917
- [Man 18] Both?
- Both work.

737
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:53,750
- [Man 18] Which one is best?

738
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,417
- I don't know you
well enough, you know.

739
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:57,375
You know what I mean?
- [Man 18] Yeah.

740
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,834
- They both work.
- [Man 18] Yes.

741
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:00,000
- Which one do you wanna do?

742
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,834
- [Man 18] I would like
to try to take a gap year--

743
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:02,667
- So take a gap year.

744
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:05,000
- [Man 18] I'm scared.
- Well that's why you're asking.

745
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,083
- [Man 18] Yes.

746
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,667
Which one would you do?

747
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:09,959
- I wouldn't take either.

748
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:11,458
- [Man 18] What would
you do then?

749
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,083
- I can't answer that for you.

750
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,166
Fear is holding you back,
you know what you wanna do.

751
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,667
The only reason
you're not doing it

752
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:17,834
is 'cause you're scared of doing

753
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:19,458
what you actually wanna do.

754
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:20,792
Right?
- [Man 18] Yes, yes.

755
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:21,708
- Are you scared to do it,

756
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,375
'cause your
parents won't like it?

757
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,667
- [Man 18] No, my
parents actually support me.

758
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:27,875
- Okay, so what are
you scared of? Failing?

759
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,250
- [Man 18] Not failing but

760
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,875
still being at the same place,

761
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,750
when my friends
are at the next level.

762
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,458
- Huge mistake.

763
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:37,625
You don't want the same
thing your friends want.

764
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:38,458
- [Man 18] No.

765
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,125
- So why the fuck do
you care what they have?

766
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,250
Number one mistake
so many people make

767
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,417
is they care about
what other people have.

768
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:45,834
I don't give a
fuck what anybody has.

769
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:47,875
If I have more, if I
have less, it doesn't matter.

770
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,834
I worry about myself.

771
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:50,959
The fact that
you're worrying about

772
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:53,250
other people's accomplishments
is already a losing formula.

773
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,417
You need to get
rid of that first,

774
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:56,375
then you can focus on yourself.
- [Man 18] Thank you.

775
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,667
- You understand?
- [Man 18] Yes, I do.

776
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:58,875
- You just have to
talk these things through

777
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:00,250
and then when you
get to the right answer,

778
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,458
you answer to which I love.
- [Man 18] Yes.

779
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,083
- So the fact that you
care that one year later,

780
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,166
you do your thing,
which you love

781
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:07,500
that you decided
what you wanna do,

782
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,667
but you weren't successful,

783
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:10,250
your friend got a
job and now he's got

784
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,917
a little bit more money,

785
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:13,000
but that bothers you.

786
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,667
I pulled a $45 million
business in four years

787
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:18,041
and was still paying
myself $40,000.

788
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:22,208
No fancy car, no fucking watch,
no fucking bling bling,

789
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,917
because I knew
what I was doing it for.

790
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:27,542
I believed fully, she's still
here, in what I was doing.

791
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:31,083
Right, you're worried about
way too many short term goals,

792
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,375
when you have,
when your mouth says

793
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,417
that you want big time goals.

794
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:34,625
- [Man 18] Yeah.

795
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:39,375
- [Man 19] I launched my
company last summer in Belfast.

796
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:43,000
We have now
1,000 paying customers

797
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,041
and shipping 2,000
devices next month.

798
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:49,250
And we have two
options to choose from.

799
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,667
Option One is that we grow to--

800
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:52,000
- Let's keep moving pictures.

801
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,542
- [Man 19] 10,000 customers
in two years

802
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:57,333
and break even with
the funding we have.

803
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:00,875
Or, do we start up
another funding rounds,

804
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,583
and we know there's
interest from investment firms.

805
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,083
- [Gary] I would take the money.

806
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,166
- [Man 20] (laughs) Of course.
- [Man 19] Yeah?

807
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:07,959
- I'll tell you why.
Thank you, my friend.

808
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:09,917
Because I think the
money's gonna dry up.

809
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:11,166
- [Man 19] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

810
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:15,542
- And so, I think if you
feel like you're getting money

811
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,792
at the value that you feel
good about, I would take it.

812
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:18,750
- [Man 19] Yeah?

813
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,250
- [Man 21] Another photo, 
another photo.

814
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,041
- And I know that
you hear me say a lot,

815
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:25,125
don't take the
money if you can do it.

816
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,250
The only thing I would say is

817
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,875
if you've got funding interest

818
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:32,417
and you're getting
the money at the terms

819
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:36,041
that you want,
well then take it.

820
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,375
- [Man 19] Yeah, yeah.

821
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:40,875
So, you would say
better grow faster.

822
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:42,125
- [Man 22] Photos, you want photos?

823
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,166
- If you're capable.

824
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,667
- [Man 23] I started
a business with my father

825
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:46,000
like six months
ago in Persian Rugs.

826
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,834
- [Gary] Okay.

827
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:47,583
- But it's difficult for us

828
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:48,291
to really find
the right consumers.

829
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:48,875
- [Gary] Pictures.

830
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:49,708
Big try.
Thank you, man.

831
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:52,291
- [Man 23] We think
they are like 40 plus,

832
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,875
their age about 40 plus.

833
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:56,667
We have social
media but it's very hard

834
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:57,917
for us to target them.

835
00:24:57,917 --> 00:25:00,625
Which kind of
content do you prefer us

836
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,583
to use in social media?

837
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:03,917
- Facebook.

838
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:07,417
- What kind of content
should we use on social media?

839
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:09,917
- Pictures and
videos of your products.

840
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:12,458
- Yeah, but I mean in what
way because we make pictures.

841
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:13,166
- I don't know.

842
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:15,834
I don't know your business
well enough to know exactly.

843
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:19,917
But the creative is
the variable of success.

844
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:24,125
So, the bottom line is that
I don't really have a read

845
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:28,875
on exactly what
you're doing with your biz.

846
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,542
A lot of people I can give
advice to 'cause of the general.

847
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:36,417
Yours is very
specific, so, I don't know.

848
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:39,000
What I know is, clearly, what
you're doing isn't working.

849
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,500
- [Man 23] Yeah but
social media ads

850
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,667
would you prefer?

851
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:42,625
- Facebook.

852
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,583
'Cause you can
target 40 years and older,

853
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:46,708
and $100,000 income and higher.

854
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:47,625
Are you targeting like that?

855
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:50,083
- Yes.
- And so, it's not converting?

856
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:53,083
- Not really, but I really
have to work on my content.

857
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:55,250
- How much are you spending?

858
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,583
- About like 20 euros a day.

859
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:59,000
- 20 euros a day?
- [Man 23] Yes.

860
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,375
- Well, that's a
very small number.

861
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:03,959
You're not sure if
it's working or not.

862
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:05,375
How many days have you done it?

863
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:06,625
- Like a month.

864
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:08,083
- Yeah, you
haven't even started.

865
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,708
- So I'm under her
and I'm working under her

866
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:13,542
and I'm building a business,
but I'm finding a hard time

867
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:16,208
keeping my attitude up
when I'm controlling people

868
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,583
because I lose my attitude

869
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:20,333
when I lose
control over the situation.

870
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:23,583
- Okay.
- How do I handle that?

871
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:26,291
- I mean, I'm not sure.

872
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:29,291
I don't know you well enough

873
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:31,291
but if you're managing people,

874
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:32,959
composure is the
only thing that matters.

875
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,834
Being the bigger
woman in every situation

876
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:35,834
is the only thing that matters.

877
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:38,208
- So, when I lose control,
how do I--

878
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,583
- Well, why are losing control?

879
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:40,959
What's bothering you so much?

880
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:42,834
- Because I'll lose
control of their situation,

881
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,959
it's something I can
not have control over.

882
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:46,959
- You shouldn't be a
manager until you figure out

883
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:49,291
how to fix that inside of you.

884
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:50,834
So, whether that's
therapy, or reading,

885
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:53,625
or meditation, or
rethinking the situation.

886
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:55,750
If you're too emotional
when you lose control,

887
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,041
you'll never manage.

888
00:26:57,041 --> 00:27:00,500
- Then how do 
I keep my attitude up?

889
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,000
- By reframing your
brain to valuing what matters.

890
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,208
- Okay.

891
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:09,458
- 99% of things don't matter.
- Right.

892
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:10,750
- And if you're
getting upset, that means

893
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,750
you think everything matters.

894
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,792
I'm never upset.

895
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,542
- How do I keep
my head cool, then?

896
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:16,834
- I don't know,
there might be something

897
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:19,041
deeper inside of you in
the way that you were raised

898
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:21,333
or the way you're wired,
you need to figure that out.

899
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:22,959
For now, I would tell you

900
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:24,875
if that's where you're
coming with your question,

901
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,208
and that's your thing,

902
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:27,917
you need to take
a big step backwards

903
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:30,333
and not want to manage.
- Okay.

904
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,375
- The only people I let
manage are the coolest,

905
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:34,792
calmest, most grounded.

906
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:36,708
- So, I just have to be calm.

907
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:39,125
- Yes, but that's, yeah,
great, that's not so easy.

908
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,583
I've said that
to a million people.

909
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:41,583
You're not gonna be calm.

910
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:43,000
You need to take
a big step backwards

911
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,458
and figure out
why you're not calm.

912
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:46,041
Well look, first of all,
good news, you're in Italy,

913
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,250
which is an amazing country.

914
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,125
- Yeah.

915
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,667
- You know, you've
gotta take a step back

916
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:50,834
and be honest with yourself.

917
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:52,625
If you're
struggling in your business,

918
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:55,083
it means you're
lying to yourself.

919
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:55,875
- Okay.

920
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:58,458
- And so, either your product
isn't as good as you think,

921
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:01,417
you're overpriced, it's not
as good as you think it is.

922
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:04,917
You gotta go and ask
customers that said yes and no,

923
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:05,750
and ask them what they think.

924
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,208
Same advice I just
gave to that young man.

925
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:09,667
The customer's right,
not a marketing genius,

926
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:11,083
not the people that created it.

927
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:13,166
Ask the customers,
the ones that said yes,

928
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:15,208
and the ones that said
no, and take your emotion

929
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:17,500
out of the equation, and
then see what the truth is.

930
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,250
Watch what I do,
so listen, do shit.

931
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,917
- [Man 24] Just 
starting doing shit.

932
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:22,500
Like, when I thought
of the 60 Second Club,

933
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,583
I did it an hour later.

934
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:27,625
And I have a big
audience, I have a lot to lose.

935
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:30,917
- [Man 24] Mhmmm.
- Right? I have a lot to lose.

936
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,708
And then, again, I just said it,

937
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:36,291
well it's been fuckin'
three months, I switched back.

938
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:38,125
I'm not scared to change.

939
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:39,834
- [Man 24] Just do shit.
- Do shit.

940
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:42,792
I knew that I was a businessman.

941
00:28:42,792 --> 00:28:44,417
You guys, most of
you didn't see this,

942
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:48,792
that big man that I
hugged out, I was the wine guy.

943
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:50,667
- [Man 25] Yeah.
- I was the wine guy.

944
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:52,291
So I started
makin' business videos,

945
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:54,625
and everybody's
comment were, stick to wine,

946
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:57,708
do what you do, what the fuck
do you know about business?

947
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:58,750
I'd already built the business,

948
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,875
people didn't
even know me for that.

949
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:02,166
Just do shit.

950
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:05,667
I decided I'm gonna
start a beanie company,

951
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:08,542
I may or may not,
but I'm tryin' to do it.

952
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:09,500
Right?

953
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,583
Remember the honey comp,
where's the honey company?

954
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:14,667
Remember, for some of
you that watch #AskGaryVee.

955
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:15,959
- [Man 26] VaynerToys.
- There is no honey company.

956
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:18,208
VaynerToys failed.
Like, there's no honey company.

957
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,208
I didn't get to it.

958
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:22,458
I tried to, I got a lot
of samples, I got a lot of data.

959
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:23,959
I'm just doing all the time.

960
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:25,708
We're ideating every day,
making shit on the spot.

961
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:26,792
- [Man 26] Playing around,
testing.

962
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:29,125
- Play doing,
doing, doing, doing, doing.

963
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:31,625
If one out of
30 things succeeds,

964
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,041
it's better than
all of the things

965
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,458
that you guys haven't started.

966
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:37,500
- One, the biggest value you
can just share with my viewers.

967
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,000
- Well, what kind
of viewers are they?

968
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,708
Youngsters?

969
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:41,667
- Youngsters like me, people
wanting to start a business,

970
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:42,750
people who need
personal development.

971
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,208
- You know, it's patience.
It's fuckin' patience.

972
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:46,458
- Patience, okay.
- It's patience.

973
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:48,291
Like, all of you
want it too fast.

974
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:51,166
I'm 41 years old, and
I feel like I'm seven.

975
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:52,792
(group laughter)

976
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:57,333
When I was 15, or 17, or
22, I thought 41-year-olds

977
00:29:57,333 --> 00:30:00,708
were so fuckin' old,
they felt so old.

978
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:03,542
I wish all of you 13,
16, 19, and 24-year-olds

979
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:05,834
could feel how young
I am in my soul right now.

980
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:07,583
It would change
everything you do.

981
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:09,375
You would become
dramatically more patient,

982
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,083
which would mean that
you would make a lot more

983
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:13,041
of the successes
that you want to happen.

984
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,667
Most of you will
lose because you're

985
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:15,875
trying to take shortcuts.

986
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:18,417
The problem is, right now,
everybody's building apps,

987
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:21,333
and they're not
building businesses.

988
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:21,917
- Yeah, that's true.

989
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:23,250
- [Gary] I know.

990
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,208
Like, you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

991
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:25,708
- [Gary] That is what
you need to think about.

992
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:26,834
- Thank you.

993
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:28,625
- [Gary] It's
the business of apps,

994
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,333
not apps that are businesses.

995
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:32,083
Everybody's thinkin' about apps.

996
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:35,041
Your app might be right, do you
have a sustainable business?

997
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,708
The economics of the
scale of what you're building

998
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:37,667
is very difficult.

999
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:40,083
- One thing you would have
done different in VaynerMedia?

1000
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:40,917
(clicks tongue)

1001
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:42,583
Zero.
(group laughter)

1002
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:45,083
- [Man 27] No regrets.
- [Gary] No regrets. None.

1003
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:49,750
I appreciate you asking that.

1004
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,792
What value in the world does
it have to look backwards

1005
00:30:53,792 --> 00:30:55,625
in a world where you're gonna
make a ton more mistakes?

1006
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,417
Do you know what I mean?

1007
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:59,959
Reconciling mistakes
you've made in the past

1008
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:02,250
in a world where you're
gonna be making a bunch more,

1009
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,250
seems like a
waste of energy to me.

1010
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,625
You know?

1011
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:06,792
You learn from your mistakes,

1012
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:09,834
but who knows if
I didn't do that.

1013
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,625
Everything's wired together.

1014
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:14,000
If I didn't make that mistake,

1015
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,583
but would of that
lead me to that meeting,

1016
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,291
which became my ultimate upside?

1017
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,625
You can't unwind them.

1018
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:22,291
Everybody wants to
unwind shit to tactics.

1019
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:24,667
That's why I
stay so macro, got it?
