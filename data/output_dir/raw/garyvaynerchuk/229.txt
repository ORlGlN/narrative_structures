1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,273
(mellow music)

2
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:16,056
- [Phone Recording] DailyVee
and AskGaryVee Show.

3
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:17,473
- Fantastic city.

4
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:35,332
To the citizens of Asia as a whole,

5
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:39,703
I'm excited about our
relationship over the next decade.

6
00:00:39,703 --> 00:00:43,036
(calm electronic music)

7
00:01:07,116 --> 00:01:09,292
- I want to really, really focus on Asia.

8
00:01:09,292 --> 00:01:12,125
So we have to have a conversation.

9
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:26,857
Basically what I want to
get through the system

10
00:01:26,857 --> 00:01:28,608
is either you believe in me or you don't.

11
00:01:28,608 --> 00:01:29,769
Because that's how we win.

12
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:31,602
That's how we go fast.

13
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:34,784
You know, like, I'm just
gonna do whatever is right,

14
00:01:34,784 --> 00:01:36,731
and I'm so confident in what my energy is.

15
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:39,280
I know how I look at it, you know?

16
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,595
So just positivity.

17
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:42,822
That's, that's, that's,

18
00:01:42,822 --> 00:01:44,384
positivity and optimism.

19
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:45,962
That's the currency.

20
00:01:45,962 --> 00:01:47,335
- I just wanted to come say "thank you".

21
00:01:47,335 --> 00:01:49,335
And I'm ultimately like,

22
00:01:50,885 --> 00:01:53,402
You are great at wine.

23
00:01:53,402 --> 00:01:54,388
I believe it was just yesterday,

24
00:01:54,388 --> 00:01:55,221
we were sitting there,

25
00:01:55,221 --> 00:01:56,765
opening up like 50 bottles
at a steakhouse somewhere

26
00:01:56,765 --> 00:01:58,371
I'm going, "we're wine-o-viniacs,""

27
00:01:58,371 --> 00:02:01,959
and you're getting just better at this,

28
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,100
and it's just priceless.

29
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,266
And it's been priceless to me.

30
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:06,213
I actually think you underestimate

31
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:07,130
your value.

32
00:02:08,114 --> 00:02:10,247
You're out there talking to entrepreneurs,

33
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:11,080
but for me,

34
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,505
I get to speak personally
on a daily basis,

35
00:02:13,505 --> 00:02:15,086
especially in the last two years,

36
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:17,691
the inspiration and the assertion,

37
00:02:17,691 --> 00:02:19,640
affirmation that I get from you,

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,513
you know Michael Phelps will

39
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:22,294
put on his headphones before he goes in,

40
00:02:22,294 --> 00:02:23,761
I'm queuing up, scrubbing through,

41
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:25,080
finding DailyVees quotes

42
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,446
before I'm walking down the
street to go into the office

43
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,323
or before I'm headed into a meeting.

44
00:02:28,323 --> 00:02:29,528
It's been powerful for me

45
00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:31,199
and it's really made a difference in

46
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,772
the way I manage my day-to-day.

47
00:02:32,772 --> 00:02:33,605
- I appreciate that.

48
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:35,323
To your point,

49
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:36,919
I think people,

50
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,848
I'm scared to say,

51
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:43,305
to actually articulate how
much I don't underestimate it.

52
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:45,972
I know exactly what's happening.

53
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:49,777
I think I haven't even started.

54
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,887
Is this the next meeting?
- Yeah.

55
00:02:55,887 --> 00:02:57,426
- They were given to me a long time ago,

56
00:02:57,426 --> 00:02:58,697
and I was in my closet,

57
00:02:58,697 --> 00:02:59,585
and I was like,

58
00:02:59,585 --> 00:03:00,726
you know, if I wear these today,

59
00:03:00,726 --> 00:03:04,829
they feel very, like
I came from Hong Kong.

60
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:06,116
My energy is going to be the same,

61
00:03:06,116 --> 00:03:08,664
which is to maximize the happiness

62
00:03:08,664 --> 00:03:10,964
and the impact of all
the best players, right?

63
00:03:10,964 --> 00:03:12,909
If you're trying to hire those two

64
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:14,549
junior video people,

65
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:18,093
you just need to look for hustle, speed,

66
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:20,584
religion, and look at the work.

67
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:21,879
The people that know how to do it

68
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:25,462
are kind of doing it
by themselves at home.

69
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,492
I couldn't find anybody for Vanoo Media.

70
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:29,725
I just hired people,

71
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:31,100
ran them through it,

72
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,854
and some worked and some didn't.

73
00:03:33,854 --> 00:03:34,687
Cool.

74
00:03:43,675 --> 00:03:44,675
- Asia, huh?

75
00:03:46,256 --> 00:03:47,173
- Uh, Asia.

76
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,008
We just need to figure this out, dude.

77
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:53,258
There's just so much goodness going on.

78
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:04,699
There's a lot of things
that we don't talk about

79
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:06,230
that make it scary.

80
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,803
Which is why I don't like

81
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:11,749
the current state of
entrepreneurship in the world

82
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:14,049
because it seems very party,

83
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:15,247
and popular,

84
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:16,468
and cool,

85
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:19,353
and it is literally everything but.

86
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:21,733
I started my daily vlog.

87
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:24,059
Yes, I like attention and I want selfies,

88
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:25,545
but much more.

89
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:28,487
Because I want people to
see how hard it really is.

90
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:30,598
How long every day is

91
00:04:30,598 --> 00:04:32,650
if you wanna be successful.

92
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,483
And so,

93
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,207
I'm scared of everything.

94
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:41,789
Which actually ironically
means I'm scared of nothing.

95
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:44,498
- And when you say "growth happy",

96
00:04:44,498 --> 00:04:47,298
- Somebody who has the ability

97
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:50,512
to understand what is
trying to be accomplished,

98
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:51,998
and then know all the triggers

99
00:04:51,998 --> 00:04:54,023
that are under priced
in a digital landscape

100
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:55,055
to make them happen.

101
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:58,136
I think event marketing is
the great growth hack of life.

102
00:04:58,136 --> 00:04:58,969
I really do.

103
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:00,570
It's why all my energy is
going that direction right now.

104
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,752
When you think of the
ROI of event marketing,

105
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:06,339
event marketing

106
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,075
should be profitable business development.

107
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:10,733
2018, we are going to be

108
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:13,402
the best modern day media company.

109
00:05:13,402 --> 00:05:14,770
We're gonna do everything right.

110
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,873
This is what I always tell the team,

111
00:05:16,873 --> 00:05:17,952
it's so frantic,

112
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:19,320
like there's so much going on,

113
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,909
but sometimes you gotta take a step back

114
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:24,274
and think about the
fact that we literally,

115
00:05:24,274 --> 00:05:25,660
we bought you in January.

116
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,117
I've got it. Like, I'm
seeing it now, you know?

117
00:05:28,117 --> 00:05:29,208
So, that's all.

118
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,555
Just think about a lot
of different things.

119
00:05:30,555 --> 00:05:32,094
But the wine thing for sure.

120
00:05:32,094 --> 00:05:33,760
I'm pumped. It's real.

121
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,093
It's gonna work.

122
00:05:38,974 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Camera Person] You guys ready?
