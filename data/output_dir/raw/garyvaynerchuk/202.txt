1
00:00:01,491 --> 00:00:03,761
- Alright, great workout with Jordan

2
00:00:03,761 --> 00:00:05,308
who taught me some stuff.

3
00:00:05,308 --> 00:00:07,724
Now I'm gonna teach
him and you some stuff.

4
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:09,338
Ready?
- Let's do it.

5
00:00:09,338 --> 00:00:11,171
(rap)

6
00:00:21,514 --> 00:00:24,943
- Step one, find a place that sells stuff

7
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:28,564
under priced to internet market places.

8
00:00:28,564 --> 00:00:29,481
This place.

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,060
Step two, go into the store

10
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:37,362
and find the toy section.

11
00:00:37,362 --> 00:00:39,114
Where is it?

12
00:00:39,114 --> 00:00:40,460
Where is it?

13
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,725
Step three, make Jordan
download the eBay app.

14
00:00:43,725 --> 00:00:47,892
Amazon too but, oh there's
the toy section, I see it.

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,387
Step four, start looking
at all the random toy stuff

16
00:00:56,037 --> 00:00:59,620
and look for stuff like
Star Wars or Disney

17
00:01:00,497 --> 00:01:04,483
or something that people
give a shit about.

18
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:06,487
Alright, we found our first one.

19
00:01:06,487 --> 00:01:07,570
50% off.

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,301
The Good Dinosaur, 99.

21
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:14,450
Five bucks, looks like there
might be a couple more in here.

22
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,644
Let's look it up.

23
00:01:15,644 --> 00:01:18,144
(chill music)

24
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:22,781
Not a big fan of little items

25
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:24,406
but then we might have
nailed something here.

26
00:01:24,406 --> 00:01:27,301
So you guys can see these
are $2.99 a pop, right,

27
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:31,278
and there's a bunch, there's
some more boxes up here

28
00:01:31,278 --> 00:01:35,011
I think that has cases
of it so lotta volume.

29
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,511
(chill music)

30
00:01:39,735 --> 00:01:42,325
If you look carefully I've
been showing you sold results,

31
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:43,158
right Jordan?

32
00:01:43,158 --> 00:01:44,025
You just learned that lesson,

33
00:01:44,025 --> 00:01:45,954
you see things listed,
like your yo-yos that...

34
00:01:45,954 --> 00:01:48,618
These are listed are
listed all day at seven

35
00:01:48,618 --> 00:01:50,501
or eight bucks a pop which
would have been great

36
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:54,080
at a $1.99 but because we
didn't fold, not as good.

37
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,769
We'll do books another day,

38
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:59,121
but books are gangster on Amazon.

39
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:03,464
Like an Oprah book, I'm
telling you, gangster.

40
00:02:03,464 --> 00:02:06,203
Guys, it's not for everybody
cuz it really comes

41
00:02:06,203 --> 00:02:08,100
down to how valuable your time is,

42
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,955
but for the people that
are really looking for two,

43
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:12,545
or three, or four hundred
dollars more a month,

44
00:02:12,545 --> 00:02:15,020
it's just really sitting
there in so many stores,

45
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,559
Goodwill, garage sales, Job Lots.

46
00:02:17,559 --> 00:00:00,000
