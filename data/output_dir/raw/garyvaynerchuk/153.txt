1
00:00:00,161 --> 00:00:02,536
- Cool.
- Let's get that post up ASAP.

2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:03,536
- OK.
- Ferg.

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,269
(laughs)

4
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:09,095
I'm gonna start doing that, I think.

5
00:00:09,095 --> 00:00:10,764
I think I just invented something, vlog.

6
00:00:10,764 --> 00:00:11,901
Just every time I say ASAP,

7
00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:13,526
I'm just gonna rap Ferg a little bit,

8
00:00:13,526 --> 00:00:15,578
paused after it because that's my man.

9
00:00:15,578 --> 00:00:16,938
Show some sorta highlight there.

10
00:00:16,938 --> 00:00:18,912
If I could rap I'd be fuckin' rappin',

11
00:00:18,912 --> 00:00:20,821
I would've wrapped it all up by now.

12
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:23,040
I would've sold all my
businesses, I would be on my way.

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,913
- [Mission Controller]
Apollo 11, this is Houston.

14
00:00:24,913 --> 00:00:29,080
You are go for TLI, over.
(slow, steady piano music)

15
00:00:30,505 --> 00:00:33,255
Apollo 11, thank you, roger, out.

16
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,693
(fast, steady piano music)

17
00:00:41,934 --> 00:00:44,517
(techno music)

18
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:16,457
- [Gary] You made it!

19
00:01:16,457 --> 00:01:18,202
- Yeah, man.
- You figured it out.

20
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:20,074
Tell me the whole story.

21
00:01:20,074 --> 00:01:22,509
- All right, so I'll
start from the beginning.

22
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:25,689
Like, I found out about you
through The Breakfast Club.

23
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:27,049
- Stop watching (bleep) Lost.

24
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:28,809
- So, like I seen you on there

25
00:01:28,809 --> 00:01:30,560
and was digging what you were sayin'.

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,041
Over like, the past, I dunno,

27
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,339
like seven months since I
just like discovered you,

28
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:37,191
like I feel like sometimes
you're like tuggin' at me,

29
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:39,013
like while I'm at work
listening to you like,

30
00:01:39,013 --> 00:01:40,686
hey man, quit your job.

31
00:01:40,686 --> 00:01:42,009
- (laughs) Like a voice?

32
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:43,696
- Yeah, I like my job, but like,

33
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:45,833
how the heck am I gonna stand out?

34
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,688
And I know you like rap music.

35
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:49,581
I was like man, if he could hear me spit,

36
00:01:49,581 --> 00:01:52,357
like I know, or at least
I think I can impress you.

37
00:01:52,357 --> 00:01:53,477
♫ It got I got I got I got

38
00:01:53,477 --> 00:01:54,725
♫ Internship on internship

39
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:56,160
♫ Inside my resume

40
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,176
♫ In that visual communications

41
00:01:58,176 --> 00:02:00,018
♫ I got BFA

42
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:02,023
- Yeah man, I think we should do it.

43
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:05,453
I think it's a funny story
for everybody on the internet.

44
00:02:05,453 --> 00:02:07,623
I think, he's clearly got the skills

45
00:02:07,623 --> 00:02:09,044
to be able to do it, and more importantly,

46
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:12,608
I think we can motivate millions of people

47
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,386
to go and get theirs, too.

48
00:02:14,386 --> 00:02:16,063
I think we owe it to him,

49
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:19,186
and I think we owe it to
them to make this hire.

50
00:02:19,186 --> 00:02:21,271
I think it'll make the
full circle feel real good.

51
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:22,571
- 'Grats.
- Okay, thank you.

52
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:23,806
- Good, you guys go jam.

53
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:25,723
- That's cool.
- Great.

54
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:29,506
- Headed to Wine Library now,

55
00:02:29,506 --> 00:02:33,159
do some meetings there with
my own internal media team,

56
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:35,621
and then head to the Super Tasting

57
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:39,788
which is a super exciting
charity event at Wine Library.

58
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:43,560
So it should be a pretty rad day.

59
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,477
(electronic music)

60
00:02:59,253 --> 00:03:02,003
I want to activate every part of,

61
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:08,070
definitely, as you can imagine,
definitely this, right?

62
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,143
Whole area, people...

63
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:10,906
There's a lot that can be done.

64
00:03:10,906 --> 00:03:12,506
We have unlimited firepower.

65
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:14,727
- 'Cause our numbers are pretty high

66
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:15,853
from a social media perspective.

67
00:03:15,853 --> 00:03:19,543
- You know, it can't be a
bad decision for you guys

68
00:03:19,543 --> 00:03:21,028
to jam with me for (bleep).

69
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:22,030
Now it's about figuring it out.

70
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,188
- Right.
- Right?

71
00:03:23,188 --> 00:03:24,021
- Yeah yeah yeah.

72
00:03:24,021 --> 00:03:25,296
- I mean, how the fuck can that not work?

73
00:03:25,296 --> 00:03:29,379
- Right, Rick?
- (laughs) Right.

74
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,224
Let me tell you the story of this event.

75
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:39,141
In 2001, I'd been kind of operating

76
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:41,256
and been in the game now,

77
00:03:41,256 --> 00:03:43,289
in the business for
about three full years.

78
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,175
And there was a couple of wine tastings

79
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:46,935
going on in the state.

80
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,730
The laws had changed, and allowed us to do

81
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,831
these kind of events with charity.

82
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,664
Liquor laws are very difficult.

83
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:54,395
So many laws, can't do a lotta things.

84
00:03:54,395 --> 00:03:57,636
I thought it was our time to
jump into the fray of this.

85
00:03:57,636 --> 00:04:00,867
So I started kind of like strategizing it

86
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:03,784
in the late spring, summer of 2001.

87
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:08,250
Brandon Warnecke, who some of you know,

88
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,742
and Bobby Shifrin, my cousin,

89
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:13,715
who I was just both talking to outside,

90
00:04:13,715 --> 00:04:17,700
who are main cogs in this
business besides me and my dad.

91
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,594
I decided to send them on a
trip to Spain to taste wine,

92
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:24,669
much to the chagrin of my dad,

93
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:26,761
who said you can't send the
two most important people

94
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:28,279
on a trip together.

95
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,281
And I said to my dad,
"You know, it's fine,

96
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:31,376
"I've got this for a week,

97
00:04:31,376 --> 00:04:33,383
"let them enjoy before the big tasting,"

98
00:04:33,383 --> 00:04:34,346
you know.

99
00:04:34,346 --> 00:04:36,494
As some of you know, I've got high energy,

100
00:04:36,494 --> 00:04:38,873
so not only did I decide to
do our first ever tasting,

101
00:04:38,873 --> 00:04:40,290
this event, then,

102
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,780
but I also decided to
launch our first catalog

103
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,444
even though we were
doing the e-comm thing,

104
00:04:45,444 --> 00:04:46,897
I was doing our first catalog.

105
00:04:46,897 --> 00:04:51,837
So it was a very very very busy
summer and spring that year.

106
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:53,590
- I just wanna say thank
you for everything,

107
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,089
and I really loved your concept--

108
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:56,776
- Thank you.
- And I feel I like, changed.

109
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:58,493
- Thank you so much, ma'am,
really glad you're here.

110
00:04:58,493 --> 00:04:59,398
- Thank you.

111
00:04:59,398 --> 00:05:02,065
- You wanna take a photo?
- Yeah.

112
00:05:04,214 --> 00:05:05,373
- Awesome.
- Thank you.

113
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:06,678
- It's a real pleasure.

114
00:05:06,678 --> 00:05:07,636
- Hi, I'm Stefan.

115
00:05:07,636 --> 00:05:08,715
Just wanna say thank you so much

116
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:10,543
for all the stuff that you do.

117
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,535
- Hey, this is Sasha.

118
00:05:11,535 --> 00:05:12,749
Ace.

119
00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:14,076
- I brought a couple of friends.

120
00:05:14,076 --> 00:05:15,179
- I'm glad!

121
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:16,312
And I'll never forget,

122
00:05:16,312 --> 00:05:17,705
it was actually pretty tough,

123
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:20,300
even though the business
was growing so quickly

124
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,189
that everybody came back from the summer

125
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,453
and that fall was super busy,

126
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:26,525
plus the catalog, plus this tasting,

127
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:29,979
so even for me who can go 24
hours a day and do everything,

128
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:32,858
I was like, shit, I can't
wait til they get back.

129
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:34,165
So I'll never forget it.

130
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:36,931
It was the Jets' first game of the season.

131
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:37,880
Sunday morning,

132
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,399
it was Herman Edwards'
first game as the coach,

133
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,982
and I was getting ready
to leave the house.

134
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:46,412
This was back when you
still had a home phone,

135
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:47,978
and the phone rings just,

136
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:50,537
I mean literally, I had my
hand on the knob, I'm leaving.

137
00:05:50,537 --> 00:05:53,382
The phone rings, nobody
really calls me at my house,

138
00:05:53,382 --> 00:05:54,863
so I decided to pick it up.

139
00:05:54,863 --> 00:05:56,869
And it's Brandon telling me

140
00:05:56,869 --> 00:05:59,998
that they missed their flight,
that they won't be home,

141
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:02,797
because Bobby got kidney stones

142
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:06,224
and he's in the hospital in Paris.

143
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:07,088
- Have a good one.

144
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:09,416
You do something with yourself, Babbit?

145
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,449
- [Photograoher] Use your skills.

146
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:11,446
Can I get the five?

147
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:12,946
- Yeah, hell yeah!

148
00:06:14,197 --> 00:06:15,479
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

149
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,438
- I just started...
- Vlog, look.

150
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:18,808
We finally found him.

151
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:20,010
- I'm here.
- We finally found Rick.

152
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,368
- It's Rick and Gary. Love this man.

153
00:06:22,368 --> 00:06:24,449
- Next day was 9/11.

154
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:28,052
And I get a crazy call from Brandon.

155
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:30,101
For some of the old-timers in this room,

156
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:32,197
remember when there was
phones in the planes?

157
00:06:32,197 --> 00:06:35,831
And so he called from the air, Brandon,

158
00:06:35,831 --> 00:06:37,888
at 9:09 in the morning.

159
00:06:37,888 --> 00:06:39,867
And said "great news, we're coming home."

160
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:41,040
And I said to him,

161
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,675
"I'm not sure, there's
something weird going on."

162
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:45,678
None of the towers had fallen yet,

163
00:06:45,678 --> 00:06:49,169
but I knew the second plane
had hit, so it was weird.

164
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:51,286
Anyway, long story short,
they landed in Canada.

165
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,765
They were there for another four days,

166
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:54,532
they didn't get back
until like September 17th.

167
00:06:54,532 --> 00:06:56,153
(audience laughs)

168
00:06:56,153 --> 00:06:58,957
This tasting was on this day in 9/11,

169
00:06:58,957 --> 00:07:01,055
so I guess five weeks after.

170
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:02,388
Right around the time

171
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:05,399
where there was even some
level of conversation

172
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,223
of maybe debating get back to normalcy.

173
00:07:08,223 --> 00:07:09,659
I know a lot of you traveled to be here

174
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:12,277
but for this area it was hardcore.

175
00:07:12,277 --> 00:07:14,643
And it was just super interesting

176
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,582
because I remember my dad...

177
00:07:17,582 --> 00:07:18,632
It was a very special night

178
00:07:18,632 --> 00:07:20,190
because it helped a lot of people

179
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,456
as one little tiny piece

180
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:23,648
of getting back to a
fun night and normalcy.

181
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:26,281
And so this place, this
building, this event

182
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:29,302
holds a very near and
dear place in my heart.

183
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:31,159
But what I remember more than anything

184
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,547
was my dad pulling up.

185
00:07:32,547 --> 00:07:35,517
At this point I was really operating.

186
00:07:35,517 --> 00:07:39,156
And he pulled up, and
it was so packed here

187
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:40,836
and there was so much going on.

188
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,224
And I remember he looked
at me and he goes,

189
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:46,064
"What other event is going on here?"

190
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:48,564
And I said to him "No,
this is our entire event."

191
00:07:48,564 --> 00:07:50,571
And he was so pumped, so proud.

192
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,766
And that's just a feeling
I've never forgotten.

193
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:54,057
- With your dad.
- Yeah, of course.

194
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,021
Want me to take it?
- Sure.

195
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:57,938
- I got it.

196
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:02,464
It's a rare photo, dad.

197
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:03,967
Sasha smiled!
- That's right, that's right!

198
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:05,455
- He smiled.

199
00:08:05,455 --> 00:08:07,403
Nothing matters to me more than my family

200
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,662
and it's been a lot of fun

201
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:11,243
getting involved with
Wine Library a little bit.

202
00:08:11,243 --> 00:08:12,952
Mom, you're the most famous person

203
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:14,106
that's never been on the show.

204
00:08:14,106 --> 00:08:15,510
(Mom laughs)

205
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,803
Give them some good parenting advice.

206
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:17,810
Something.

207
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,937
Give 'em something.

208
00:08:18,937 --> 00:08:20,360
You've been on the show!

209
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,443
There you go!

210
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:23,934
You got it, feeling good?

211
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:26,999
There, you got air time! (laughs)

212
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:28,508
Mom, give them one piece of advice.

213
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,209
- I dunno.
- Something.

214
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,164
- Just love him the way I love him.

215
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:34,581
He's my sunshine.

216
00:08:36,152 --> 00:08:38,866
- And, you know, starting
the wine club, which...

217
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:41,599
How many people, by a show
of hands, in the wine club?

218
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,683
How many not?

219
00:08:43,642 --> 00:08:46,392
Mm-hm.
(laughter)

220
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:49,753
The honesty is amazing!
(laughter)

221
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:51,574
It fucking hurt, but it's amazing.

222
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:54,921
Somebody very interesting,
follow me, come here.

223
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:56,338
Eric! Eric! Eric!

224
00:09:00,204 --> 00:09:01,290
- What's going on?

225
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,811
- Vlog, this is very important.

226
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:03,951
- Oh my god.

227
00:09:03,951 --> 00:09:05,242
- This is Eric Godfrey.

228
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:07,729
Nate, this is Eric Godfrey.
- What's going on?

229
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:10,367
- This is the man who made
me a New York Jets fan.

230
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:11,641
This is not a joke.

231
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:15,189
This man, this man, in my neighborhood,

232
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:18,692
in the fall of 1982, made me a Jets fan.

233
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,848
Took me to my first
Jets game with his dad.

234
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:23,188
Like, Eric Godfrey.

235
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,779
- I tried to get my dad to come tonight.

236
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:25,860
- This is literally...

237
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,893
- So you're my Eric Godfrey?

238
00:09:26,893 --> 00:09:28,320
- I'm your Eric Godfrey,
this is Eric Godfrey.

239
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,257
(laughter)

240
00:09:29,257 --> 00:09:33,562
This is literally the man
responsible for the entire thing.

241
00:09:33,562 --> 00:09:34,563
- When you own it!

242
00:09:34,563 --> 00:09:35,763
- How do you feel about that?

243
00:09:35,763 --> 00:09:36,763
- Fantastic!

244
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:39,126
I'm glad to be here, man.

245
00:09:39,126 --> 00:09:40,524
This is pretty epic.

246
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:42,761
- Yeah, it's pretty rad.

247
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:44,071
- This man I haven't seen.

248
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:45,356
- Dad!

249
00:09:45,356 --> 00:09:47,819
I feel like tonight's, this,

250
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:50,237
and hopefully it'll be cool
for you guys to say it one day

251
00:09:50,237 --> 00:09:51,531
if it continues to evolve.

252
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:54,792
I'm excited to start the
next chapter of this event.

253
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:57,569
And I really would like to do

254
00:09:57,569 --> 00:10:00,803
this specific event going forward.

255
00:10:00,803 --> 00:10:03,493
You know, I think a lot of you flatter me

256
00:10:03,493 --> 00:10:04,913
with your comments and thoughts,

257
00:10:04,913 --> 00:10:06,795
but nobody dreams bigger for them.

258
00:10:06,795 --> 00:10:08,476
You know, as much as you dream

259
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:09,863
of me accomplishing my things,

260
00:10:09,863 --> 00:10:11,151
I dream even greater.

261
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:14,517
And so, even when I sit
in this room in 27 years

262
00:10:14,517 --> 00:10:15,789
as the owner of the New York Jets,

263
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:18,078
I plan on doing this little event.

264
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:20,222
And so I'm really really thankful

265
00:10:20,222 --> 00:10:23,111
for you guys to be at
the first one of this.

266
00:10:23,111 --> 00:10:25,052
And I appreciate you guys being here.

267
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:25,989
So thank you.

268
00:10:25,989 --> 00:10:28,239
(applause)

269
00:10:32,349 --> 00:10:33,881
I'll sit down with you for an hour,

270
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:35,349
and we'll do a working session.

271
00:10:35,349 --> 00:10:36,349
And I'm thrilled

272
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:39,109
to give you unbelievable
amounts of feedback on that.

273
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:40,294
Mainly because I think

274
00:10:40,294 --> 00:10:42,742
I'm really in a position
to give you great feedback,

275
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:46,070
because I've been thinking
about it for three years.

276
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,682
I've been producing content
every day, filming everything,

277
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:51,344
with 100% this in mind.

278
00:10:51,344 --> 00:10:53,957
- When the AskGaryVee book came out,

279
00:10:53,957 --> 00:10:56,635
I had my assistant order
a thousand fucking copies

280
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:59,094
and I was throwing the fucking book.

281
00:10:59,094 --> 00:11:00,804
I was throwing the fucking book.

282
00:11:00,804 --> 00:11:02,748
Told my employee, read it.

283
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:04,222
(laughter)

284
00:11:04,222 --> 00:11:05,962
Fucking read it motherfuckers!
Because that's--

285
00:11:05,962 --> 00:11:08,543
- So listen, I get it more than you know.

286
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,639
I've been literally building a library

287
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,458
of not only my 2000 answers,

288
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,477
every fucking word out of my mouth.

289
00:11:15,477 --> 00:11:18,059
I believe in it more than anybody.

290
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:20,436
I think that my legacy and my brand

291
00:11:20,436 --> 00:11:21,791
sits at the top

292
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,193
because I'm Watson.

293
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:25,936
We both got better
looking as we got older,

294
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,152
which is very rare.

295
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:29,386
- I'm telling you man, I'm telling you.

296
00:11:29,386 --> 00:11:33,136
- Big night, um, just
a perfect night, right?

297
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:35,866
It was an event that was a huge thank you

298
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:37,945
for meaningful charities.

299
00:11:37,945 --> 00:11:42,166
It was a huge night for
me to give back to my dad,

300
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,171
and to my community,

301
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:48,338
and to the Wine Library
customer community, and staff.

302
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:53,771
It was a good night.

303
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:56,188
(soft music)

304
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:04,312
- [Photographer] Okay, one more?

305
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:07,119
Oh, lordy.
(laughter)

306
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:08,218
- I don't think we got it.
Did we get it?

307
00:12:08,218 --> 00:12:09,268
We didn't get it.

308
00:12:09,268 --> 00:00:00,000
We got it?
We got it!
