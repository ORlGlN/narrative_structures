Ben asks Gary what if your children

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,890
taught you about life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> business first</font>

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,540
of all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a great video big ups i</font>

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,070
think the Instagram videos have huge

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,690
potential as well the creativity is

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,190
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> through more than the YouTube</font>

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,260
videos were just person space so that's

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,660
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun you know it's funny i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> took</font>

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,400
that this question as well because i

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">think my answer is going to be super</font>

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,460
unpopular i think i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,420
people are going to be you know

13
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,890
everybody's looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the romantic</font>

14
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,779
answer right like you know the truth is

15
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">i love my kids insanely but i love my</font>

16
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">wife and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i love my parents so insanely</font>

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know i love them more but like</font>

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,760
the rocks always scared when i go

19
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,500
politically incorrect now do you

20
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,270
recommend is the true that I promised me

21
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,010
very honest on this like do I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

22
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,480
kids more to my parents it's a really

23
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting debate for me it's much</font>

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,070
closer than the normal politically

25
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,449
correct or answer that I hear from

26
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,190
others so it's not like they taught me

27
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">how to love I you know people say that</font>

28
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,000
all time I was loving everything

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,660
before um I guess some you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I guess</font>

30
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,329
at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day the things that</font>

31
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,780
really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what this is</font>

32
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trancer the the thing that my kids</font>

33
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,549
have taught me about life and I guess I

34
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:12,990
believe this very much in business and

35
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,430
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you that have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been jamming</font>

36
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,830
with me for a long time no they've

37
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,080
taught me<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the other side how</font>

38
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">powerful DNA really is watching my kids</font>

39
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,509
do the same exact things i do like<font color="#E5E5E5"> misha</font>

40
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,490
when she performs in our living room

41
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,860
she's spending more time trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay</font>

42
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">attention if we're paying attention then</font>

43
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:32,549
on her actual performance that's what I

44
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,320
do when I give talks I'm like looking in

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">the crowd to make sure they're not on</font>

46
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,470
their phone like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Xander's looks</font>

47
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,799
of like like I got you like just<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy</font>

48
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,140
so like<font color="#CCCCCC"> they taught me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how powerful DNA</font>

49
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,290
is it's you know and and maybe they

50
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,560
taught<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to uh you know maybe they've</font>

51
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,200
taught<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a more extreme level of</font>

52
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,720
respect for Lizzie I'm it saying she's

53
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">an just an incredible mother and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">watching her how she's executing in her</font>

55
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,670
role with them is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh has taught me a</font>

56
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,450
lot about her um but for me you know

57
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,008
they haven't taught me<font color="#CCCCCC"> jack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rap about</font>

58
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,120
business and other than the reason I

59
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,770
been on people is based on

60
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,570
my intuition around their DNA and then I

61
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,520
watched their DNA come full throttle I'm

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:00:00,000
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big DNA guy</font>
