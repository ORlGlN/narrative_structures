1
00:00:02,777 --> 00:00:07,467
- Tuesday morning, Chicago,
a bunch of meetings.

2
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:08,890
And then flying home, heading

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,360
to London tomorrow, first
thing in the morning.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,235
(camera whooshes)

5
00:00:14,235 --> 00:00:18,402
I wasn't done, businessman
life, hashtag that shit.

6
00:00:19,338 --> 00:00:22,338
â™« We're unstoppable

7
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:27,123
(soft instrumental music)

8
00:00:37,426 --> 00:00:40,222
First Wine Club is going
out, that's super fun.

9
00:00:40,222 --> 00:00:42,774
Ryan did you order the Wine Club?

10
00:00:42,774 --> 00:00:43,702
- I have not yet.

11
00:00:43,702 --> 00:00:46,156
- What the fuck? That just...

12
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:49,021
- I was supposed to,
and you, what happened?

13
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:51,660
- What happened was you're
not really my friend.

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,288
You don't care about me or drinking wine

15
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:57,029
at a better price point
than you are normally.

16
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:59,415
You know, it's $55 a month
and shipping included.

17
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:00,618
- [Ryan] And what do you get for it?

18
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:02,523
- One, two, three, or
four bottles a month.

19
00:01:02,523 --> 00:01:04,994
And next month, it's gonna be four bottles

20
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:07,776
all built for your Thanksgiving.

21
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,585
- Can you have Tyler email
me, I'm just gonna send

22
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:12,245
it to Mark and help us out quick.

23
00:01:12,245 --> 00:01:13,597
Just tell him to email
me the link or whatever.

24
00:01:13,597 --> 00:01:16,077
- Sold. (laughs)
- (laughs)

25
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:18,850
- Dear Tyler, please
cancel Ryan's subscription.

26
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:19,848
(laughing)

27
00:01:19,848 --> 00:01:23,787
I bought two roses that
are big-time roses.

28
00:01:23,787 --> 00:01:25,326
I think people think about rose just

29
00:01:25,326 --> 00:01:28,642
in the Spring and the Summer,
but big-time complement

30
00:01:28,642 --> 00:01:31,532
with like an aperitif
or a lot of the stuff

31
00:01:31,532 --> 00:01:33,618
that people drink at Thanksgiving.

32
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:37,294
So I'm gonna pink up people's turkeys.

33
00:01:37,294 --> 00:01:40,272
Good morning Instagram,
hope everybody's doing...

34
00:01:40,272 --> 00:01:42,005
Oh we're here, thank you so much.

35
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:43,048
So you're with us the whole time?

36
00:01:43,048 --> 00:01:43,881
- [Woman] Yes.

37
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:46,082
- Great, so I'll just leave the bags then.

38
00:01:46,082 --> 00:01:48,873
Good morning Instagram, good to see you.

39
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:50,471
Hope everybody's doing super well.

40
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:52,558
I'm gonna talk about
competition entrepreneurship.

41
00:01:52,558 --> 00:01:55,849
And so the exciting part
is either the wine is free

42
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,711
or the conference is free at
my original stomping grounds.

43
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:02,090
First 200 people, that's
it locking it down.

44
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,423
8:00 AM to 10:00 AM Saturday October 14,

45
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:09,610
Springfield, New Jersey, see ya.

46
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,110
(soft instrumental music)

47
00:02:25,252 --> 00:02:27,759
Great meetings at Pepsi Co. Chicago.

48
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,842
Now heading out to more
client stuff for PureWow.

49
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:35,470
Hope you're doing well YouTube.

50
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,970
(soft instrumental music)

51
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:45,655
But now what you're
watching is innovation,

52
00:02:45,655 --> 00:02:48,428
innovation, innovation,
features, features, features.

53
00:02:48,428 --> 00:02:51,856
And this poll feature is
super intriguing to me

54
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:55,082
because it's now starting
to make the Stories function

55
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:58,307
more interactive, more data
collection, more valuable.

56
00:02:58,307 --> 00:02:59,354
DRock keeps getting kicked out

57
00:02:59,354 --> 00:03:00,430
because we don't have enough spots.

58
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,263
- [DRock] (mumbles)

59
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:03,091
- [Gary] That's why we have
no footage, just walk in.

60
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:06,924
(rhythmic instrumental music)

61
00:03:16,177 --> 00:03:17,407
Were you filming?
- No.

62
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:18,350
- It wasn't filming?
- No.

63
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,911
- Are you filming now?
- Yes.

64
00:03:19,911 --> 00:03:22,823
- You guys missed it,
DRock was once again wrong,

65
00:03:22,823 --> 00:03:24,190
and I was once again right.

66
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,429
- I didn't see it honestly.

67
00:03:25,429 --> 00:03:26,457
- What are you talking
about, you were right here.

68
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:28,470
- I didn't see it, if anything I heard

69
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,117
that DRock was right and Gary was--

70
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:32,486
- Shutting down PureWow, breaking news.

71
00:03:32,486 --> 00:03:35,291
(laughing)

72
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,663
- (laughs) Brand closed for business.

73
00:03:37,663 --> 00:03:41,580
- Brand closed, PureWow
fails on DRock support.

74
00:03:43,026 --> 00:03:44,896
Everybody here already loves DRock.

75
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:45,729
- I know that.

76
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:47,068
- You know, like they all
like him more than me.

77
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:48,485
It's like that whole like thing.

78
00:03:48,485 --> 00:03:51,546
It happened with Mott
on Wine Library TV too,

79
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:53,006
that's just how it always is.

80
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:55,606
You're like, "Oh I like that guy better."

81
00:03:55,606 --> 00:03:57,316
- You know? Which is...
- Not better.

82
00:03:57,316 --> 00:03:58,300
- He's also just a nicer guy.

83
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,818
- Better at sucking.

84
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:01,957
- [DRock] That's true, right, I am.

85
00:04:01,957 --> 00:04:06,554
- He's just like a better
dude overall, you know?

86
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:09,861
- No, I don't think so, and
DRock's an amazing dude.

87
00:04:09,861 --> 00:04:10,850
- He's pretty amazing.

88
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,125
- But he has some shortcomings.

89
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,449
(dramatic orchestra music)

90
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:15,764
- What are his shortcomings?

91
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:18,209
- On episode 307 I'll expose them all.

92
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,042
(laughing)

93
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:20,918
Ryan, let's talk about how this

94
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:22,828
was really our hardcore trip.
- Yeah.

95
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:25,873
- Let's sum it up for the
VaynerNation here on DailyVee.

96
00:04:25,873 --> 00:04:26,906
- This was really interesting for me.

97
00:04:26,906 --> 00:04:28,926
- What was most amazing about me?

98
00:04:28,926 --> 00:04:32,623
- (laughs) So this is the first trip

99
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:33,764
that me and Gary have taken

100
00:04:33,764 --> 00:04:37,170
that's purely PureWow
focused, pun on words.

101
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,510
- [DRock] Did you think of that?

102
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,993
- Yeah, so this was
solely PureWow focused.

103
00:04:40,993 --> 00:04:42,444
And it was super interesting

104
00:04:42,444 --> 00:04:45,944
because he had his gallery PureWow hat on.

105
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:49,706
You know, I think I'm a good salesperson.

106
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,091
This was fascinating for me,

107
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,494
I saw a different type of seller.

108
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:57,274
And he makes magic in the
room, it's pretty unique.

109
00:04:57,274 --> 00:05:00,217
He truly is a very good marketer.

110
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,815
He thinks of things on the spot,

111
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:04,613
when he hears a bit of
information from people,

112
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:07,769
he's able to really synthesize the room.

113
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:08,875
- DRock, you know that.
- Yeah.

114
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,887
- And spit it out in a very unique way.

115
00:05:10,887 --> 00:05:12,541
And, you know, I think there's a lot

116
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,013
of people that are really good at that,

117
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,885
but super creative, super creative.

118
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:18,742
- That's the surprising part, right?

119
00:05:18,742 --> 00:05:21,094
- No, not really, I feel
like, you know what it was?

120
00:05:21,094 --> 00:05:22,744
I knew that you'd be creative.

121
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:24,481
I mean, you don't get to where you are

122
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:27,669
without being creative
and being able to sell.

123
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:30,076
But it was interesting to see you do it

124
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:32,875
in my world as opposed
to your world, right?

125
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,780
To be able to be a chameleon and do it

126
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,692
in different businesses
is really, really unique.

127
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:41,655
- We should have Ryan on the
show more often. (laughs)

128
00:05:41,655 --> 00:05:44,089
- So PureWow's now not shut down anymore.

129
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:47,808
- No, back, we're rekindling the brand.

130
00:05:47,808 --> 00:05:49,582
VaynerX brings back PureWow.

131
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:50,415
- [DRock] (laughs)

132
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:53,875
On a serious note, I think
instead of just like a puff piece

133
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:58,613
for me and propaganda for me,
let's turn this into you guys.

134
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:00,825
The chameleon part, empathy,

135
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:03,108
the other person, it all works out.

136
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:06,131
The reason I'm a good speaker,
it's about the other person.

137
00:06:06,131 --> 00:06:08,615
I'm grounded as a businessman,
I'm a good businessman.

138
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:10,243
I really know how to run business,

139
00:06:10,243 --> 00:06:12,600
so when I'm in these rooms I'm empathetic

140
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,568
to what they're trying to achieve,

141
00:06:13,568 --> 00:06:15,784
whether sell product or brand.

142
00:06:15,784 --> 00:06:17,519
I can audit very quickly, I'm fast,

143
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,977
that's why I'm great at Q and A.

144
00:06:18,977 --> 00:06:21,086
So in that room, in about two seconds

145
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:23,617
I understand their
business, it's just true.

146
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:27,117
And so to me the reason so much is working

147
00:06:28,781 --> 00:06:32,955
for me is I am religious
about the end consumer,

148
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:35,501
and in a B to B environment
that means their business.

149
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:37,886
And in the speech, that means
the people in the audience.

150
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:42,688
And when I create products
like the Wine Club, or 4Ds,

151
00:06:42,688 --> 00:06:44,144
or all these different things,

152
00:06:44,144 --> 00:06:46,355
it's always about the other person.

153
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:49,435
And the leverage is when
you're more valuable

154
00:06:49,435 --> 00:06:52,625
to the other person than
they are to you, the end.

155
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,146
- Yeah, you know, it's shocking.

156
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:59,313
I used to think good businessmen
always found a way to,

157
00:07:00,357 --> 00:07:04,698
you know, win a deal or to
figure out the better end.

158
00:07:04,698 --> 00:07:08,126
And something that Gary
does shockingly often

159
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:10,116
is make sure that he loses deals.

160
00:07:10,116 --> 00:07:12,436
He makes sure that the
other person feels like

161
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:14,053
they're getting the
better end of the deal.

162
00:07:14,053 --> 00:07:16,657
That they feel like,
not only that they think

163
00:07:16,657 --> 00:07:17,675
they're getting the better end,

164
00:07:17,675 --> 00:07:20,094
but they are getting the
better end of the deal.

165
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:23,170
So then six months from now
when he really needs to,

166
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,290
he can come back and he can
ask for a favor accordingly.

167
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,489
But it's with the right energy about it.

168
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,820
- You know what's really
interesting about that, man?

169
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,801
Honestly, on a very serious note

170
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:33,246
because you haven't felt
it full circle, or not.

171
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:35,192
- Right, 90% of the time you don't do it.

172
00:07:35,192 --> 00:07:37,159
- Just be always in a place
where you have the leverage.

173
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,318
- Yep.

174
00:07:38,318 --> 00:07:39,381
- Like if I get hit by a truck,

175
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:41,248
and my brain's not as good,
and I'm not good anymore.

176
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:44,177
Now I'll be like, hey DRock,
hey client, can you help me?

177
00:07:44,177 --> 00:07:45,985
I don't have it anymore.

178
00:07:45,985 --> 00:07:47,455
That's the beauty of
being a businessperson

179
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,655
and not an athlete.
- Yep.

180
00:07:49,655 --> 00:07:50,610
- You get exponentially better

181
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,868
and not slower, and not as good.

182
00:07:52,868 --> 00:07:54,432
- Absolutely.

183
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,111
- It's all about the other person, man.

184
00:07:56,111 --> 00:07:57,833
Run the marathon, not the sprint.

185
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,799
The short deal, where you got the extra.

186
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:01,809
So much the flaw of so many of you.

187
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:04,193
You're looking for the
short-term, everybody pounding me,

188
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,584
"Gary do this for me, do this for me."

189
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:06,417
- It's true.
- How about do something.

190
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:08,367
That's how DRock's sitting in that seat.

191
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:09,200
- It's too--

192
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,349
- I way overpaid for PureWow,
he got a much better deal.

193
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:14,099
- Underpaid.
- Overpaid, overpaid.

194
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:16,574
- Now. (laughs)

195
00:08:16,574 --> 00:08:18,431
(laughing)

196
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,264
(rhythmic instrumental music)

197
00:08:31,938 --> 00:08:35,452
- Fast, test, learn, do,
it's the same old shit.

198
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:38,955
300 episodes in, if you still don't know

199
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:40,268
you better wake the fuck up.

200
00:08:40,268 --> 00:08:44,101
(rhythmic instrumental music)

201
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:52,036
Hey guys, I interrupt this vlog

202
00:08:52,036 --> 00:08:54,413
to make this important announcement.

203
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:55,967
A lot of you have a whole lot of excuses

204
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:59,508
of not being able to produce content.

205
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:00,484
You know, don't have designers,

206
00:09:00,484 --> 00:09:02,262
don't have this, don't have money.

207
00:09:02,262 --> 00:09:04,591
Here is a post that I posted on Instagram

208
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:08,459
that's doing super well, and
it is basically the screenshot

209
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:12,106
of one of my Tweets that
was all written words.

210
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:16,273
So stop fucking making excuses
and start doing, period.

211
00:09:17,197 --> 00:09:18,689
Now, back to the vlog.

212
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:22,053
Guys, quick question
of the day in the vlog.

213
00:09:22,053 --> 00:09:24,845
Little new feature here, DRock.

214
00:09:24,845 --> 00:09:26,095
I'm so excited.

215
00:09:27,356 --> 00:09:31,523
What is holding you back from
making more Snapchat content?

216
00:09:32,926 --> 00:09:36,993
Lurkers answer, so many of
you watching this for free.

217
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,650
I'm asking for nothing in return,

218
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,643
and you can't even give me a content

219
00:09:40,643 --> 00:09:42,804
you dirty, dirty lurkers.

220
00:09:42,804 --> 00:09:46,762
Come out, come out, come out
and answer this one today.

221
00:09:46,762 --> 00:09:47,982
What is holding you back

222
00:09:47,982 --> 00:09:50,833
from creating more Snapchat content?

223
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:54,666
(rhythmic instrumental music)

224
00:10:01,254 --> 00:10:02,717
- End it with that.
- (laughs)

225
00:10:02,717 --> 00:00:00,000
- Oh crap, I have to go
on a phone call anyway.
