00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,890
yet to reply<font color="#E5E5E5"> to every tweet i SAT and</font>

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,270
looked the best buy right then and there

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,639
I can do it myself so I don't know why

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,920
fest I can't hire an intern for zero

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,349
dollars and zero cents and do it see

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,900
everybody talks about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,270
nobody doesn't and what I'm obsessed

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">with is this then a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jersey boy</font>

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,400
like me could go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and buy a camera</font>

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,650
for 300 bucks sit down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> put out</font>

12
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,810
content about the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I love the</font>

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,439
most right and compete with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like</font>

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,329
the wine spectator and decanter magazine

15
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,570
and Robert Parker who've got 25<font color="#CCCCCC"> years of</font>

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,149
equity who've got millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dollars</font>

17
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,570
behind them and that is a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

18
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,520
when I started<font color="#CCCCCC"> really realizing it I</font>

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,829
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Zagat family if you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

20
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,660
what's if God is is it got ratings for

21
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,480
restaurants so you know in the US

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,489
there's a big rating system for

23
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:54,449
restaurants you might have seen if

24
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:57,180
you've ever been 25 out of 25 there it

25
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,649
was huge of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-million dollar</font>

26
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">business the second day that Yelp was in</font>

27
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,099
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> market I called them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and said you</font>

28
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,990
need to pay attention to this right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

29
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,330
because if you don't counter this you're

30
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,560
going to be out of business at night in

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,140
nine months to years careers really

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,970
didn't matter they completely laughed it

33
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,159
off then I saw them here later and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

34
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,720
were kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a little bit more intrigued</font>

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,390
and now they call me every day saying

36
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">health and I'm like asshole it's over</font>

37
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:30,479
that ship has sailed and so what I'm

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,030
excited about is this what I wrote that

39
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,650
book about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that comes out a couple weeks</font>

40
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,619
is this that we live<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the age</font>

41
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,829
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am convinced</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eighty-five</font>

42
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent of you that I'm looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

43
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,210
now do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> love what you're doing one</font>

44
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,060
hundred fifty percent you just don't and

45
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,850
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my opinion three years ago that was</font>

46
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,299
fine but today it's not because the cost

47
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,509
of entry to be in the game<font color="#CCCCCC"> around your</font>

48
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,310
passion is zero it costs zero dollars to

49
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a tumblr account</font>

51
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,649

hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> bucks to buy a flip camera an</font>

to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> video or you can write or</font>

55
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,990
audio not everybody is extroverted as we

56
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,280
it doesn't have to be a knowledge of not

57
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,500
everybody is charismatic and handsome

58
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">and smart as I am by then but you have</font>

fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the matter is that you can build</font>

that's super super underrated it's

73
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,830
called working really hard the fact that

74
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,310
you can work really hard and actually

75
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,290
filled a business today is so different

76
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,450
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> it used to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be because going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

79
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,650
easy and all you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do is add reply</font>

80
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,540
them and talk to them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a</font>

81
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,519
trillion niche sites around your subject

82
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,040
there's thousands tens of thousands of

83
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,810
wine blogs and I don't care if<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

84
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,720
number four on Alexa or compete or

85
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,610
number eight million it's a person and

86
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,470
actually caring about the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

87
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about your rant whether they have</font>

88
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,110
400,000 followers on Twitter or seven

89
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,180
it's a human being you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

90
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,030
give a and plus the person that has

91
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,510
70 by the way might have 400,000 one day

92
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,390
and so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're living in this</font>

93
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,130
insane shift we're clearly eyeballs are

shifting they're going in a different

95
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,000
direction people are consuming media and

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,130
all sorts of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> platforms and the</font>

97
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,290
fact that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all as individuals have</font>

98
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,260
ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tap into that with work and</font>

99
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,780

00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,490
brand and built a business how we get to

154
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,500
users Facebook and Twitter<font color="#CCCCCC"> and YouTube</font>

155
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">get all the credit they're tools</font>

156
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,330
on top of the bigger later right I mean

157
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,060
they're a marker Facebook's a damn stamp

158
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,430
Stabler you know Twitter's a bunch of

159
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,650
markers you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you know it companies</font>

160
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,210

Twitter account what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

162
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,620
 cookie build a business off of

163
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,400
that what I know is this to have the

164
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,670
cost of entry<font color="#E5E5E5"> be 0 like it is today and</font>

165
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,100
to make excuses of why you're not

166
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,990
building or why you're not hearing what

167
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,480
I'm excited about is this everybody

168
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">talks about how transparent and</font>

169
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,740
authentic it is it really<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

170
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,640
because my<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNA gets me excited when I</font>

171
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,140
see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people up here and I come</font>

172
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">up here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and start cursing for god knows</font>

173
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,650
why and there's a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font>

174
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,370
don't necessarily like the over-the-top

175
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,780
extroverted bravado that I bring to the

176
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,220
table<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people like that it's</font>

177
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,110
authentic and real the fact that matter

178
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,540
is this though because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have the</font>

179
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,340
ability to engage<font color="#E5E5E5"> with people on a</font>

our<font color="#E5E5E5"> Underpants at home or what is very</font>

182
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,220
powerful because for my brand it's been

183
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,020
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful for the brands</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that have</font>

185
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,130
themselves and got into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trenches</font>

186
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,250
it's been successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and most of all the</font>

187
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,310
consumer has changed you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I don't</font>

188
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">see a pretty girl now and grab a club</font>

189
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,580
and hit her in a head and dragged her by

190
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,570
the hair we've evolved as human beings

191
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,640
so have the consumers they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

192
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">be sold to the way everybody's used to</font>

193
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,080
they want a piece of it they want you to

194
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,420
give a crap they want to engage whether

195
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,760
you're a brand or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a celebrity and if you</font>

196
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,980
don't adjust to that and if you throw

197
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,840
lines in the sand of what you want

198
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">instead of what they want you have</font>

199
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,310
absolutely no shot of winning in this

200
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,770
game and so much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> is coming how many</font>

201
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,639
in this room are from

202

00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:16,699
boxy<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot TV</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they might've bought</font>

205
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:19,909
calm now I don't know if foxy is going

206
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:21,889
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> friendster</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and be too early</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

207
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:24,740
not win but I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right now the</font>

208
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,650
concept of boxy is going to win and when

209
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,629
cable television at least in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font>

210
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:30,650
it's something I understand a little

211
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,049
better when TV<font color="#CCCCCC"> falls people going to</font>

212
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,549
 their pants cuz then things are

213
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,169
gonna change because then brands are

214
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,669
gonna be scattered they're gonna try to

215
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,140
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> because what brands like to</font>

216
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,729
do is they like to be really lazy

217
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,380
they'll either just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say here's 12</font>

218
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,849
million dollars we know we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

219
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:45,680
eyeballs or they<font color="#E5E5E5"> think because there's a</font>

220
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,540
box<font color="#E5E5E5"> that every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4,000 homes for whatever</font>

221
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,959
and so to me what happens with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

222
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,870
opportunity when everything shifts when

223
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,430
the eyeballs go in different<font color="#E5E5E5"> places I</font>

224
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,709
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy billboards and bus stop that</font>

225
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:59,899
and tax the ads for wine library until I

226
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:01,160
was walking<font color="#CCCCCC"> down the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> street and</font>

227
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,380
everybody in New York<font color="#CCCCCC"> City was coming at</font>

228
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,699
me like this and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they're</font>

229
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:10,010
not looking at my add any more things

230
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,990
change people aren't thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about them</font>

231
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,940
and to me there's a lot of excitement

232
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,680
opportunities in it and I know people

233
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,540
are scared and but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people in</font>

234
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,000
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> room unless you work for a gigantic</font>

235
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,760
company if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that happened that</font>

236
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,519
would make me excited it would be that

237
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">you gave substantial consideration I</font>

238
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,510

239
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,699
being here you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much more than</font>

240
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:33,170
ninety nine percent of the people out

241
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,910
there but when I think all of us

242
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,890
including myself have not totally

243
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,380
completely swallowed completely put into

244
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,260
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNA is how big this ship is how</font>

245
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,560
substantial ish changes and how real it

246
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,570
is for you to build a business around

247
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,550
the things you love the most and I

248
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,250

250
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,560

00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you love that and that work</font>

that's who wins it's obvious we see it

254
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,820

261
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,310
