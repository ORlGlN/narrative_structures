1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,917
- Yes Phil?

2
00:00:02,727 --> 00:00:04,299
My hat size?

3
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:05,533
No I do not know my hat size.

4
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:07,041
I don't wear hats.

5
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,724
(muttering)

6
00:00:09,724 --> 00:00:10,863
I wear beanies.

7
00:00:10,863 --> 00:00:11,696
- [Phil] You wear that Yankees.

8
00:00:11,696 --> 00:00:14,216
- I do wear hats a little bit
when I beat you in tennis.

9
00:00:14,216 --> 00:00:16,549
You've never beaten me, bam.

10
00:00:19,994 --> 00:00:20,827
What are you doing?

11
00:00:20,827 --> 00:00:22,753
- [Man] Measuring your
head, it's for your hat.

12
00:00:22,753 --> 00:00:24,006
This is absurd.

13
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:27,506
(upbeat, energetic music)

14
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,008
You have to communicate
contextually and creatively

15
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:37,856
in these channels where
these humans now live.

16
00:00:37,856 --> 00:00:40,956
I love how people keep
saying this is coming.

17
00:00:40,956 --> 00:00:43,866
I always get such a kick out of that

18
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:46,134
because this, it's happened.

19
00:00:46,134 --> 00:00:48,007
The data is so black and white,

20
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,521
there's a reason 97% of
consumer packaged goods

21
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:51,619
are declining.

22
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:55,019
It's 'cause they're over
allocating in trade, FSI's,

23
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:57,019
television, direct mail.

24
00:00:57,976 --> 00:00:59,420
It's just so black print.

25
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,078
It's just so black and white.

26
00:01:02,078 --> 00:01:05,563
I almost feel like I'm in
that movie, the Big Short,

27
00:01:05,563 --> 00:01:07,226
and I'm the guy with the glass eye.

28
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:09,662
The fundamentals are obvious.

29
00:01:09,662 --> 00:01:10,813
Yeah, what up Instagram.

30
00:01:10,813 --> 00:01:12,528
We're about to draw, thank you so much.

31
00:01:12,528 --> 00:01:14,147
When did we do it, Cyber Monday?

32
00:01:14,147 --> 00:01:16,158
Black Friday, Tuesday, Saturday?

33
00:01:16,158 --> 00:01:17,599
Anyway, doing the drawing,

34
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,893
five of you are gonna join
me for dinner in New York.

35
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:20,726
What's gonna happen?

36
00:01:20,726 --> 00:01:22,117
Alex is gonna get all the winners

37
00:01:22,117 --> 00:01:24,224
and then coordinate with all five

38
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,341
and we can send it all the
way out to like, April?

39
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:28,058
Am I flying them out here?

40
00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:29,277
Yeah I did, yeah.

41
00:01:29,277 --> 00:01:33,077
Flying out the five of you
to New York for dinner.

42
00:01:33,077 --> 00:01:34,640
Now, for everybody who doesn't know

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,597
what the fuck is going on,

44
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:38,293
on Black Friday weekend,
Cyber Monday weekend,

45
00:01:38,293 --> 00:01:39,389
I did a giveaway.

46
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:40,405
Give me Crushing It real quick.

47
00:01:40,405 --> 00:01:41,475
I'm gonna do another one right now, right?

48
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:43,859
So we're gonna do a
breakfast version of this.

49
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:46,091
This is the dinner version,
I'll get to it in a minute.

50
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:47,394
Where do we send the receipts to?

51
00:01:47,394 --> 00:01:48,554
Okay, we're gonna start a new one

52
00:01:48,554 --> 00:01:50,977
called 10copies@vaynermedia.com.

53
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:54,407
Andy, can you have somebody set
up 10copies@vaynermedia.com?

54
00:01:54,407 --> 00:01:55,240
- [Andy] Ten copies?

55
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,191
- You got that D-rock?

56
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:59,346
D-rock can do things like that?

57
00:01:59,346 --> 00:02:00,237
D-rock, good shit.

58
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:02,392
Anyway, get ready for
everyone who's watching.

59
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:04,104
10copies@vaynermedia.com.

60
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:05,258
You weren't part of the five,

61
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,733
it costs you less to do the
dinner than the breakfast.

62
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:09,137
That's how shit works.

63
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:12,252
Wait till lunch at
40copies@vaynermedia.com.

64
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:14,365
But right now, five
copies if you bought it,

65
00:02:14,365 --> 00:02:15,785
so for example, this
person's gonna be sad.

66
00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:17,017
I'm gonna pull this one right now.

67
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:19,374
You did not win, this is gonna
be a heartbreaking moment.

68
00:02:19,374 --> 00:02:21,620
But this person, for example, Bill James,

69
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,922
he could've won but he didn't.

70
00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:24,275
He did not win.

71
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:28,307
But Phil bought five copies
and so he got in here once

72
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:30,219
but other people bought 10 copies,

73
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:32,569
and Lev, over here, Lev, did his job.

74
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,587
He's not only good at
finding Darren Lee jerseys,

75
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:38,020
he's also good at, if
you bought 20 copies,

76
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,366
four of your receipts came in here.

77
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:41,423
Five of you are getting flown out

78
00:02:41,423 --> 00:02:42,805
to have dinner with me together.

79
00:02:42,805 --> 00:02:43,638
Can't wait to do it.

80
00:02:43,638 --> 00:02:44,471
It's gonna be a great podcast.

81
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:46,549
It's gonna be a great piece of content.

82
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:48,530
And all of you will be buying Crushing It,

83
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,970
all of you, all of Earth.

84
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,926
I'm gonna pull out five people right now

85
00:02:51,926 --> 00:02:53,555
And the five, Phil James, I'm sorry.

86
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:55,627
The first person joining me for dinner

87
00:02:55,627 --> 00:02:58,025
in New York somewhere in the spring

88
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:00,265
is, I'm just gonna give these
to you right on the spot,

89
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:02,783
(verbal drum roll)

90
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:06,177
You're just filming, you're
not part of the content, Tyler.

91
00:03:06,177 --> 00:03:07,760
Here we go, is, is,

92
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,503
can you help me here?

93
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:14,887
You don't have the name?

94
00:03:14,887 --> 00:03:16,440
Like what, is that why you wrote that?

95
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,981
- [Lev] Yeah, Canner.

96
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:21,564
- Yeah, but what's the
person's first name?

97
00:03:24,023 --> 00:03:26,208
- [Lev] That was the
first name of the email.

98
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,041
Hold on.

99
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:31,554
- Show him, he's a real bad guy.

100
00:03:31,554 --> 00:03:32,891
He's probably getting fired.

101
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:34,970
Guys, breaking news, Lev's been fired.

102
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,255
Let's just send him right to HR.

103
00:03:37,255 --> 00:03:39,498
All right, I've got news
for you, it's in the UK.

104
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:40,647
Oh, it got chopped off.

105
00:03:40,647 --> 00:03:41,480
Not your fault.

106
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,313
Lev, congratulations.

107
00:03:42,313 --> 00:03:43,550
Canner in the UK.

108
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,665
You're the first.

109
00:03:44,665 --> 00:03:47,635
Fucking UK, right off the bat.

110
00:03:47,635 --> 00:03:49,387
These next four better be in London

111
00:03:49,387 --> 00:03:50,388
so we can just do it in London.

112
00:03:50,388 --> 00:03:51,390
Canner congrats.

113
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,122
Person number two, now remember

114
00:03:53,122 --> 00:03:54,442
for all of you that are live,

115
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,805
sorry for people, we'll
have to edit a little bit.

116
00:03:55,805 --> 00:03:57,105
Nah, actually just leave it.

117
00:03:57,105 --> 00:03:59,105
Five copies on one day,
you send in the receipts

118
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,266
to 5copies@vaynermedia.com,
now I'm pulling it.

119
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:03,550
Dinner with me probably in New York,

120
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,895
but maybe now London.

121
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:06,987
And we're about to do
another one in a second,

122
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:08,951
you guys did not miss out no FOMO

123
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:12,072
if you wanna have breakfast
with me and five others,

124
00:04:12,072 --> 00:04:14,406
it's gonna be 10 copies,
this is gonna keep going up.

125
00:04:14,406 --> 00:04:17,060
Breakfast, oh, afternoon tea, right,

126
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,405
is gonna be like 80 copies.

127
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:20,991
Number two is David Hutchinson

128
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:23,175
in San Bernardino, California.

129
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:25,853
We're off to a tough start location wise.

130
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:27,429
Person number three to
have dinner with me,

131
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:28,789
it's gonna be epic too.

132
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:30,204
I'm gonna teach you everything about life

133
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:31,889
and make you 43 million dollars.

134
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:33,587
That's a good trade for five copies.

135
00:04:33,587 --> 00:04:36,624
D-rock have you set up
10copies@vaynermedia.com?

136
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:39,957
Third person for this one is Eric Algern

137
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,639
in San Diego, California.

138
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,571
All right, two in California right now.

139
00:04:44,571 --> 00:04:46,500
Person number four, I got it.

140
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,000
It's Jarn Shoden-Pirabon, congratulations.

141
00:04:51,703 --> 00:04:53,123
I've no idea where you're from,

142
00:04:53,123 --> 00:04:54,477
but it looks like it's in US dollars.

143
00:04:54,477 --> 00:04:55,438
Let's hope.

144
00:04:55,438 --> 00:04:57,987
And the final person in
the first dinner series,

145
00:04:57,987 --> 00:05:02,154
breakfast series coming up
next, is C. Helth Hipple.

146
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:06,820
Congratulations to the five
winners and that's that.

147
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,935
Let's pick one person who
would have been a winner

148
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:13,455
if I was doing six people
just for a little razz.

149
00:05:13,455 --> 00:05:15,007
Just so you can make the
joke with your friends.

150
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:19,189
The first person that
lost is Levi McCormick.

151
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:20,223
Sorry Levi.

152
00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:22,411
Hey everybody this is Gary Vaynerchuk

153
00:05:22,411 --> 00:05:27,007
and this is episode 376
of the AskGaryVee show.

154
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:28,703
This is the Friday before Christmas

155
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,513
so the office is in that perfect zone.

156
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:33,044
I love the fact that so many
of you are traveling right now

157
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:36,670
and you're at home, out of
office replies, that scale

158
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,128
is always when I'm most comfortable

159
00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:40,199
because when the world is not working

160
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,176
I am actually calm.

161
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:43,960
It evolved different
than our conversations

162
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,046
we really thought, and
we still will do this,

163
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,100
we want to activate for a lot of clients.

164
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,096
A lot of clients spend too much money,

165
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:54,098
no different than
commercials and banner ads.

166
00:05:54,098 --> 00:05:55,462
You know we're always
looking for where's money

167
00:05:55,462 --> 00:05:59,247
being overspent in the reality
of the world we live in.

168
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:01,629
We feel a lot of clients, the
biggest brands in the world,

169
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,946
when they're at Superbowl,
when they're at the MBA finals

170
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:08,435
and all-star weekend and
the Kentucky Derby and CES,

171
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:12,031
spend a lot of money to
do boots or mail-in things

172
00:06:12,031 --> 00:06:15,659
that we think there's an
opportunity to do better.

173
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:18,036
We specially think that
there's something incredible

174
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:21,526
around the culture of activating
that is Instagram worthy

175
00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:24,747
and how digital and social
work with real life.

176
00:06:24,747 --> 00:06:29,009
But we thought that that's
what was gonna be the core

177
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:31,508
and that we would sprinkle ads sometime.

178
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:33,610
Wouldn't it be cool if
we created our own thing

179
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,418
whether it's a South by
Southwest or a Coachella

180
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:38,486
and obviously I'm using the biggest of big

181
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:39,745
but we'll do our own things.

182
00:06:39,745 --> 00:06:42,412
But in true Gary and Kim fashion

183
00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:45,031
like in four seconds we're like,

184
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:47,977
"You know, let's launch
our own conference."

185
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:50,906
And that's how agent
2021, how did agent 2021,

186
00:06:50,906 --> 00:06:52,371
how was that actually born?

187
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,288
I mean that was the theory
but what did happen?

188
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,631
Did I like text you in
the middle of the night?

189
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:57,617
- Erm, probably.

190
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,569
Yeah, or it was just an emoji.

191
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:01,785
Maybe just like a little
arrow sign like a car.

192
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:04,889
- Like a smiley face with
dollar signs coming out of it.

193
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:05,722
- Yeah.

194
00:07:05,722 --> 00:07:06,555
(laughing)

195
00:07:06,555 --> 00:07:08,341
No I think like with
Vayner Media as a whole

196
00:07:08,341 --> 00:07:10,888
and you, obviously, have had
a ton of inbound requests

197
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,572
just in terms of these four industries.

198
00:07:13,572 --> 00:07:15,221
There's a huge gap between
how they're marketing

199
00:07:15,221 --> 00:07:17,651
their businesses and where
consumer attention is.

200
00:07:17,651 --> 00:07:19,405
- The four industries are travel agents,

201
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:22,931
insurance agents, car dealerships,
and real estate agents.

202
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:26,514
(fast-paced, upbeat music)

203
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:31,385
When you get a chance to
tell me how great you are

204
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:35,552
or it is, or that is, you
need somebody's attention.

205
00:07:36,637 --> 00:07:40,857
What eliminates the real
estate agents of the moment,

206
00:07:40,857 --> 00:07:42,310
their lack of innovation.

207
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,245
You DM the person and say,
"I own a car dealership.

208
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:48,375
"I'd like to pay you to
show up at my car dealership

209
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,829
"this Saturday from 12 to 4 and you tell

210
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:52,321
"your Instagram followers."

211
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:54,869
I had somebody who's done
over a million dollars

212
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:57,322
in revenue in the insurance space

213
00:07:57,322 --> 00:08:01,340
doing only content and
advertising only through Facebook.

214
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,492
Every hotel company
should've gotten together

215
00:08:03,492 --> 00:08:05,056
and then bought residential

216
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:07,553
and then created an Airbnb competitor.

217
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:11,095
The startup tech world now
reminds me a lot of real estate

218
00:08:11,095 --> 00:08:14,429
now that I've been in it
because the real estate industry

219
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:18,971
has cycles when it's so
good that losers win.

220
00:08:18,971 --> 00:08:22,887
I think it's a really good
idea for every dealership here

221
00:08:22,887 --> 00:08:25,852
to buy the 20,000 mile
radius around the four

222
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:28,038
closest high schools to your dealership.

223
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:31,371
(fast-paced rock music)

224
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,159
Kim, I love you.

225
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,992
- I love you too.

226
00:08:36,993 --> 00:08:39,580
- All right, everybody have
a great, great, great holiday

227
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,614
season, I hope you enjoy this episode.

228
00:08:41,614 --> 00:08:43,985
I hope we see a bunch of you in Miami

229
00:08:43,985 --> 00:08:47,405
hit up K-pop and @vaynerexperience
if you've got questions

230
00:08:47,405 --> 00:08:49,235
they've been incredible on that.

231
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:51,447
And we will see you, you
keep asking questions,

232
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,929
we will keep answering them.

233
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:54,762
What happened?

234
00:08:54,762 --> 00:08:56,929
How did you find my stuff?

235
00:08:57,865 --> 00:08:58,866
Somewhere on Instagram?

236
00:08:58,866 --> 00:09:01,797
- So, I started looking around
and when I saw your stuff,

237
00:09:01,797 --> 00:09:04,441
you talking about you
don't do it for the money,

238
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:08,930
you do it because you wanna
give, serving the people.

239
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,089
And that's the most beautiful thing.

240
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:14,414
'Cause I think that's
where you can get legacy.

241
00:09:14,414 --> 00:09:15,247
- Legacy.

242
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:16,080
- And leave something behind.

243
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,247
- Men in their '20's they're
in their most insecure

244
00:09:21,743 --> 00:09:25,910
state, looking to scratch
a lot of short term itches,

245
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:31,618
and at the end of the bad habits

246
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:36,646
and I didn't even have my twenties.

247
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:40,744
I worked in my Dad's
liquor store day and night,

248
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:42,360
I did nothing.

249
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,943
I did more fun stuff last night

250
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:48,375
by going to the Knicks game.

251
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,579
- I was there as well.

252
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:50,412
- Yeah, you went too?

253
00:09:50,412 --> 00:09:51,245
- Oh yeah.

254
00:09:52,114 --> 00:09:53,863
- [Man] It was good when
the Garden's buzzing.

255
00:09:53,863 --> 00:09:55,832
- Yeah, it's fun when
the Garden's buzzing.

256
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:57,498
So you're super excited
about the World Cup?

257
00:09:57,498 --> 00:09:58,485
- Super excited.

258
00:09:58,485 --> 00:09:59,897
There's so much things coming up.

259
00:09:59,897 --> 00:10:02,681
And as a striker things can go quickly.

260
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:05,681
So, how do you influence the culture

261
00:10:07,713 --> 00:10:09,527
in the way, like as a supporter.

262
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:11,801
- You have to do one thing.

263
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:13,634
Just speak your truth.

264
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:15,661
You know this.

265
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:17,377
Instagram is the place, right?

266
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:18,371
Instagram is the place.

267
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:21,437
So when I look at your Instagram, right?

268
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:23,695
You have such an interesting mix.

269
00:10:23,695 --> 00:10:27,112
Like that father son thing, that's smart.

270
00:10:28,807 --> 00:10:30,414
So for example, let's just
look at the difference

271
00:10:30,414 --> 00:10:32,364
between my account and your account.

272
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:33,524
You'll find this interesting.

273
00:10:33,524 --> 00:10:36,079
These are subtle things that
I don't talk about a lot.

274
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,436
He's happy right now.

275
00:10:38,436 --> 00:10:40,305
Look, here's my profile.

276
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:42,922
It's got four long lines of data,

277
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:46,174
it's got this new Instagram
stories, the highlights

278
00:10:46,174 --> 00:10:47,250
you can put it in there,

279
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,018
where I can really tell my story, right?

280
00:10:50,018 --> 00:10:53,226
- [Man] Yeah, you've
scored in the World Cup.

281
00:10:53,226 --> 00:10:57,437
- That clip should be right
here in my World Cup goal right?

282
00:10:57,437 --> 00:11:01,646
Whereas in your account,
God is my guide is amazing,

283
00:11:01,646 --> 00:11:03,133
but you've four more lines,

284
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:04,680
it's only linked to your Twitter.

285
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,593
Little things, like it's not
bragging when it's a truth.

286
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:10,180
How old were you when you
scored your World Cup goal?

287
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,013
- 19.

288
00:11:11,013 --> 00:11:12,598
- You know, it might be
something interesting.

289
00:11:12,598 --> 00:11:14,365
I do like the fact that you've got the mix

290
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:18,930
of the football content and
the personal content, right?

291
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:19,963
I do think that's good,

292
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:22,461
but I also think a little
less polish, right?

293
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:27,115
So, I think the biggest thing
celebrities in their space

294
00:11:27,115 --> 00:11:31,572
need to do is have, once in
a while, just really raw.

295
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:34,609
Everybody wants their
Instagram to look so perfect.

296
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:37,338
You've just said, smartly,
the kids of my generation

297
00:11:37,338 --> 00:11:38,668
we're not sharing our problems

298
00:11:38,668 --> 00:11:43,576
because everybody's living
a P.R.'ed life on Instagram.

299
00:11:43,576 --> 00:11:46,575
If you look at people's
lives on Instagram,

300
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:48,021
everybody's P-Diddy.

301
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:49,928
I think one of the things that
has been really strong for me

302
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:53,428
is I don't need my content to be polished.

303
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,470
Some of it is, some of it isn't,

304
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,223
biggest lesson for these guys right?

305
00:11:58,223 --> 00:12:01,469
They wanna make great content.

306
00:12:01,469 --> 00:12:04,894
Great content is the
truth, not the lighting.

307
00:12:04,894 --> 00:12:06,046
If you're such a thoughtful young man,

308
00:12:06,046 --> 00:12:07,966
I'm getting that sense so quickly,

309
00:12:07,966 --> 00:12:12,009
when you have a thought,
just going in to the camera

310
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:14,451
and just saying, "Hey
everybody, this is my thought."

311
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:16,692
Especially with the story you just told me

312
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:18,426
would be amazing that second day

313
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:19,526
when you're down in that league,

314
00:12:19,526 --> 00:12:21,191
now you've got time to think.

315
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:23,184
I used to say lots of smart shit like,

316
00:12:23,184 --> 00:12:25,279
"Good content is the
truth, not the lighting."

317
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,415
It was lost in space, but
now Babin's super excited

318
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,960
'cause he's gonna make
that one minute video,

319
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,793
you know what I mean?

320
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:33,300
To me, here's something that
I think is always powerful

321
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,550
about athletes.

322
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,956
That classic Nike like commercial

323
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:41,047
where it's like you guys
see me scoring a goal

324
00:12:41,047 --> 00:12:43,562
in the World Cup when I'm 19,

325
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:47,729
but you're not seeing me the
day after I got injured, right?

326
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,830
Like you see it went fast, for me.

327
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,663
- You don't see the...

328
00:12:54,577 --> 00:12:56,922
- I think that's why what
I'm doing is so powerful.

329
00:12:56,922 --> 00:12:59,108
I'm documenting the journey.

330
00:12:59,108 --> 00:12:59,941
- Everything.

331
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:01,537
- And everything changed
when I started the vlog

332
00:13:01,537 --> 00:13:03,895
two years ago, because all
of a sudden when I would talk

333
00:13:03,895 --> 00:13:08,184
about hustle and hard work,
it's so obvious in their face.

334
00:13:08,184 --> 00:13:11,934
Look what today is, you
know, it's three days

335
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,757
before Christmas, the city's shut down,

336
00:13:15,757 --> 00:13:17,066
but who's in my office?

337
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:17,899
My team.

338
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:23,286
That's just the truth, and
by the way, I don't think

339
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:28,372
this is right, I'm thrilled
that 95% of my company

340
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:30,267
is with their family right
now, and they should be.

341
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,422
And I can't wait, a couple
more hours and pfft,

342
00:13:32,422 --> 00:13:33,924
next two weeks I'm out.

343
00:13:33,924 --> 00:13:38,670
But, the truth is the truth
is the truth is the truth.

344
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:42,003
I think I'm very excited because I think

345
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:44,662
we're going through a phase right now

346
00:13:44,662 --> 00:13:46,416
where everybody's trying to show the best,

347
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,747
but we've always done that.

348
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:51,055
Your grandparents in Kenya,
when they went outside,

349
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:52,871
something bad was happening in the house,

350
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:54,578
but when they went
outside and had a coffee,

351
00:13:54,578 --> 00:13:56,367
nine out of ten times.

352
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:57,200
- Good.

353
00:13:58,525 --> 00:14:00,909
- I hate when people are
like, "Social media's..."

354
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:03,621
I keep saying it's exposing us,

355
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:07,357
Oh, now people are learning
that we always put up facades

356
00:14:07,357 --> 00:14:08,768
and we don't have real conversations.

357
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:11,236
But we were doing that for years.

358
00:14:11,236 --> 00:14:12,628
When all the old Russian men used to go

359
00:14:12,628 --> 00:14:14,981
and play checkers outside in Russia,

360
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:16,442
maybe if they drank a coupla vodkas

361
00:14:16,442 --> 00:14:17,757
they'd share on what's going on at home,

362
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:21,173
but like most people,
especially immigrants, you know.

363
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:22,656
What happens in the house right?

364
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:23,703
(mumbles)

365
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:24,591
- Hundred per cent man.

366
00:14:24,591 --> 00:14:27,326
In my household, every single bad thing

367
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:30,573
that happened in my family
that I saw with my eyes

368
00:14:30,573 --> 00:14:32,671
and I can remember from 6-18,

369
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,046
died in those fucking four walls.

370
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:36,189
You went outside there's a (clicking).

371
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:37,022
So when people are like,

372
00:14:37,022 --> 00:14:39,219
"Oh everybody shows the
best version of themselves,

373
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:40,197
"we're P.R.'ing, we're not sharing."

374
00:14:40,197 --> 00:14:42,197
We never fucking shared.

375
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,198
You understand?

376
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:49,270
So if you have the ability
and the power to share

377
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,020
well then you owe it.

378
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:54,662
- You need to know yourself.

379
00:14:54,662 --> 00:14:55,692
- That's right and you're young.

380
00:14:55,692 --> 00:14:57,086
Listen, I'll tell you right now,

381
00:14:57,086 --> 00:14:58,202
and this is what I always want to say.

382
00:14:58,202 --> 00:14:59,501
I'm glad you've said that
because it allows me to say

383
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:00,501
to the vlog.

384
00:15:01,976 --> 00:15:04,039
I have the benefit of the
internet coming around

385
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:06,558
when I was already a man.

386
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:09,653
Now there's a lot of me that
wishes this was happening

387
00:15:09,653 --> 00:15:12,486
when I was 22 'cause I fucking....

388
00:15:14,576 --> 00:15:16,781
It would've been amazing to do a vlog

389
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:19,525
that looked the same
every day for nine years,

390
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:22,004
me in a liquor store.

391
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,506
For 15 fucking hours a day.

392
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,911
'Cause then everybody
would be like, "Whoa."

393
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:27,054
I love it when people
are like, "oh, duh duh."

394
00:15:27,054 --> 00:15:30,033
I'm like, "Go on YouTube
and look at episode one

395
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:31,688
"of Wine Library TV to a thousand."

396
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:33,586
There's a thousand wine videos

397
00:15:33,586 --> 00:15:35,188
'cause that's what business I grew up in,

398
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:38,355
where you can see nobody was watching.

399
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,307
So, it's cool man.

400
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,063
That makes me happy that
you wanna share like that.

401
00:15:43,063 --> 00:15:45,713
You should, but don't be fancy.

402
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:47,071
- Don't be fancy.

403
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,240
- And if you need to use
Snapchat and Instagram stories,

404
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,073
'cause that's what people are doing,

405
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:51,940
they're willing to be less fancy there.

406
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,117
Everybody's put the
Instagram feed on a pedestal,

407
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:54,950
mistake.

408
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:59,833
I love aesthetics, I
understand design, mistake.

409
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:02,001
You know how many people didn't post today

410
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:03,069
'cause they have a pimple?

411
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:05,684
(laughing)

412
00:16:05,684 --> 00:16:07,789
- A lot, but that's our
generation, you know.

413
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:08,904
- No, no, I've got good news for you.

414
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:10,095
That was my generation too.

415
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:10,928
- Was it?

416
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,911
- A hundred per cent.

417
00:16:11,911 --> 00:16:15,363
People are shitting on
millennials as if they did it.

418
00:16:15,363 --> 00:16:18,396
20 years ago none of us posted
shit without a zit either.

419
00:16:18,396 --> 00:16:20,424
If we just didn't have it.

420
00:16:20,424 --> 00:16:23,866
So we didn't go out
that Friday night, lost.

421
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:24,699
Got it?

422
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:26,782
It's just documented now.

423
00:16:28,062 --> 00:16:29,646
That's all, nothing's changed.

424
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:32,277
Here's the thing, every
young person on this earth

425
00:16:32,277 --> 00:16:33,278
needs to become grateful.

426
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:35,273
No matter how bad their situation is

427
00:16:35,273 --> 00:16:37,146
because they have the power of this

428
00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:39,138
to get them the fuck out.

429
00:16:39,138 --> 00:16:41,142
That's fucking huge.

430
00:16:41,142 --> 00:16:42,544
- That's big.

431
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:43,663
- It's bigger than big.

432
00:16:43,663 --> 00:16:45,734
I get emails, Tyler will
tell you, he's my MX ,

433
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:48,322
from homeless people because
they've got smartphones.

434
00:16:48,322 --> 00:16:50,010
So when I hear some fucking kid who's sad

435
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,820
I'm like, hanging out and having a chat.

436
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,708
I'm like dude, you
haven't even any context

437
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,177
of what's going on in the
world, and you know this,

438
00:16:57,177 --> 00:17:00,818
a great advantage you
have is your heritage,

439
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:03,485
coming from where you came from.

440
00:17:05,278 --> 00:17:07,613
Your family came from a big city in Kenya?

441
00:17:07,613 --> 00:17:10,380
- No they came from, yeah
they come from a big city

442
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,480
but they didn't have
no doubt difficulties.

443
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,563
- Hell of a lot different than Paris.

444
00:17:19,295 --> 00:17:21,133
I've gotten really, not full circle,

445
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:24,650
but the fact that when I came
to America we lived in Queens,

446
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,839
and not the Queens that it is now.

447
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,481
In a fucking room, the size
of this fucking office.

448
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,918
Multiple family members,
the fact that I know that

449
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,384
and remember it, oof.

450
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:35,134
- It makes you tough.

451
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:37,638
- I'm so much tougher than everybody.

452
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:39,771
Like, I can go to zero again.

453
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:40,604
- Absolutely.

454
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:42,305
(laughing)

455
00:17:42,305 --> 00:17:45,487
- When you can go to zero
again, that's why I'm dangerous,

456
00:17:45,487 --> 00:17:46,859
I can go to zero again.

457
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,240
- You have nothing to lose.

458
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,073
- Nothing.

459
00:17:49,073 --> 00:17:51,002
- That's something I'm
starting to have now

460
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:52,783
'cause I'm not doing it for the money.

461
00:17:52,783 --> 00:17:53,908
I saw all the cars and everything

462
00:17:53,908 --> 00:17:56,841
but, the thing that's
gonna push me to the end

463
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:58,642
and make you a legend
and influence this world

464
00:17:58,642 --> 00:18:00,209
is not the things that we see now.

465
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:01,042
- A hundred per cent.

466
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:03,525
- Having a family, stable
family, next to you

467
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:04,766
and wanting the right things

468
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:07,560
and that just changed my whole perspective

469
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,542
'cause now I meet people and ...

470
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:11,305
- My man, my man, you're 22
years old talking like this.

471
00:18:11,305 --> 00:18:12,888
You are so blessed.

472
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,675
You know how hard it is.

473
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:18,289
These two jerk offs don't know it yet.

474
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:19,489
(laughing)

475
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:21,676
They know it more, he's very smart.

476
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:23,875
Listen I know them cold, right,

477
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,869
they know it a lot more
than they did before,

478
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:28,422
but not all the way yet.

479
00:18:28,422 --> 00:18:30,855
You can't, they haven't
been as lucky as you

480
00:18:30,855 --> 00:18:32,308
and may be they didn't get
it out of their system yet.

481
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:33,355
Tyler, definitely not.

482
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:37,947
You know, like the bottom
line is, it's a big deal.

483
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:39,424
It's such an interesting observation.

484
00:18:39,424 --> 00:18:41,292
I sit here and say I've
got nothing to lose

485
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:42,746
and the person watching
on YouTube right now

486
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,747
is like, "What the
fuck's he talking about?

487
00:18:44,747 --> 00:18:46,462
"He has so much stuff."

488
00:18:46,462 --> 00:18:48,382
I have nothing to lose 'cause the stuff

489
00:18:48,382 --> 00:18:50,715
is not what I'm playing for.

490
00:18:51,737 --> 00:18:53,522
- And that's massive, yeah.

491
00:18:53,522 --> 00:18:55,466
- It's huge, there's people
who wanna buy a Viper

492
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:58,216
or a Rolex or like cool sneakers.

493
00:18:59,815 --> 00:19:03,314
I don't wanna buy sneakers,
I wanna buy sneaker companies

494
00:19:03,314 --> 00:19:05,876
with them and win Super Bowls.

495
00:19:05,876 --> 00:19:09,766
And I don't even want that, I
just want the chance to do it.

496
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:10,966
The game.

497
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:13,196
Anyway man, you're a good dude.

498
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:14,459
- Thanks man.

499
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:15,607
Nice to meet you, man.

500
00:19:15,607 --> 00:19:16,449
- Really nice to meet you.

501
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:18,796
Let's stay in touch, take a famous photo

502
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:19,903
and get our Instagram's up.

503
00:19:19,903 --> 00:19:21,770
- Let's do it.

504
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,951
- I love the home and home.

505
00:19:23,951 --> 00:19:25,598
Happy hug man, real pleasure.

506
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:26,431
Bye guys.

507
00:19:28,894 --> 00:19:30,663
Bye D-Rock I miss you.

508
00:19:30,663 --> 00:19:33,580
I don't even remember you any more.

509
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,997
Here, we're good.

510
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:39,745
Hold one second guys,
hold on, hold on a second.

511
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,495
See ya vlog, in 2018.

512
00:19:42,824 --> 00:00:00,000
(slow, electronic music)
