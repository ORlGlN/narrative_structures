120 seconds of my thoughts<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you guys about what I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,880
giving a lot of thought to I just want

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,940
on this amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to we tripped and I hit</font>

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,460
me exactly what I'm about what I want to

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,470
accomplish and I'm hoping you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

9
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,000
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little snippet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from this and realize</font>

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,189
the power in it I've come<font color="#CCCCCC"> to realize</font>

11
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:21,930
through my two-week journey of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

12
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,180
flights over 12 days and through my

13
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,920
interactions and my overwhelming<font color="#E5E5E5"> pneus</font>

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,080
of emails interaction that I've come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,199
realize it's the way I score life that

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,820
is giving me this competitive advantage

17
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,590
and bringing me all this happiness then

18
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,270
let me break it down to what I mean is

19
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,129
it's not about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many viewers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

20
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:40,469
or analytics or the click throughs or

21
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,230
the cprs or CPMs are all that crap<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

22
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,460
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not about your bank account</font>

23
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,320
either it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the connections you</font>

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">make with humans it's why you guys are</font>

25
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,500
all watching this video in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

26
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,989
place this internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is connecting</font>

27
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:53,760
us in a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's never been connected</font>

28
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,309
before and so what I realized is I'm not

29
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,469
collecting monies or baseball cards

30
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,020
anymore I'm collecting relationships and

31
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,000
that is my mission my new mission in

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,129
life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know it's not scalable but</font>

33
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:06,540
I'm gonna fight like act like everything

34
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,490
else is to meet every single person on

35
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:14,520

37
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,450

38
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,430
