1
00:00:00,235 --> 00:00:01,818
- Yo, what up vlog?

2
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:05,055
Here in Chinatown in London.

3
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:08,055
♫ We're unstoppable

4
00:00:09,262 --> 00:00:10,792
On my way to London.

5
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:12,568
On the plane all day actually so

6
00:00:12,568 --> 00:00:15,064
interesting day for the vlog.

7
00:00:15,064 --> 00:00:18,031
I don't know if a lot of you guys know,

8
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:19,720
this is one of the only pieces of content

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,508
I made during this era.

10
00:00:21,508 --> 00:00:23,125
It was the airplane rant.

11
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:26,535
Very high in the air, back from London

12
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:28,538
headed to New York City.

13
00:00:28,538 --> 00:00:32,555
I'm gonna watch it, see if
it inspires another rant.

14
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:33,907
Five years later.

15
00:00:33,907 --> 00:00:38,377
Just sat here and read
100 emails from people

16
00:00:38,377 --> 00:00:40,507
that were making 40-50K, 30K.

17
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,640
Read Crush It!, read Thank You
Economy, got inspired by me.

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,609
But I was a spark.

19
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:46,442
I was the one that had that

20
00:00:46,442 --> 00:00:50,609
insane thing that I have in
me that made them say "Hmm."

21
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,283
You know?

22
00:00:52,283 --> 00:00:54,427
Things that make you go hmm.

23
00:00:54,427 --> 00:00:56,394
'80s reference, sorry.

24
00:00:56,394 --> 00:00:58,276
But then they had it in them.

25
00:00:58,276 --> 00:01:00,271
And so when I make this video,

26
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:02,159
what's coming from my heart right now is,

27
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,271
maybe you're watching this and saying hmm,

28
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:06,997
maybe I need to hedge.

29
00:01:06,997 --> 00:01:10,380
If you work from 8:00 p.m.
to four in the morning,

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,432
will your dreams come true?

31
00:01:11,432 --> 00:01:12,265
No.

32
00:01:12,265 --> 00:01:13,562
You might not be good enough.

33
00:01:13,562 --> 00:01:15,589
You might have not
picked the right product

34
00:01:15,589 --> 00:01:18,172
but are we living in a world,
2012, that's so much better

35
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:20,181
than your parent's and grandparent's

36
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:22,292
and great-grandparent's generation

37
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:24,325
because assholes like me can make videos

38
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:26,832
when I'm 30,000 fucking feet in the air?

39
00:01:26,832 --> 00:01:28,119
Yes.

40
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:31,190
And because of that, and
because of those opportunities,

41
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,660
and because we're networked in
a way we've never seen before

42
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,492
and because sending an email to 100 people

43
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:39,308
and one will answer and
give you a shot matters,

44
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:42,552
because of that opportunity,
because of 2012,

45
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:45,552
I beg you, I beg you to take a shot.

46
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:52,046
Oh.

47
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:53,758
You good?

48
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:56,386
Oh I knew what I wanted to talk about.

49
00:01:56,386 --> 00:01:57,338
First of all, hey everybody.

50
00:01:57,338 --> 00:01:58,277
Airport Gary.

51
00:01:58,277 --> 00:02:00,395
♫ Airport

52
00:02:00,395 --> 00:02:02,737
♫ Airport

53
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:04,558
♫ Airport Gary

54
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:07,765
- This is how I sign by the
way, people have been asking.

55
00:02:07,765 --> 00:02:09,066
If you've gotten a book from me,

56
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:12,733
I sign my signature
then I do this in there.

57
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:14,857
Selling.

58
00:02:15,749 --> 00:02:18,269
Just came back from two
days with Ryan Harwood

59
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:22,089
and selling VaynerX, PureWow, VaynerMedia.

60
00:02:22,089 --> 00:02:26,101
The competition conference
I'm doing at Wine Library.

61
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:27,518
Nope, not a fare.

62
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:30,258
I just think everybody is now.

63
00:02:30,258 --> 00:02:31,932
He said Sanjay, I'm just like,

64
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:34,665
if anybody says anything, I'm like, "Hey"

65
00:02:34,665 --> 00:02:38,461
The competitor conference,
the Wine of the Month Club,

66
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:41,192
the digital corks, the Four D's.

67
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:43,803
It's been a fun kind of four
or five months of selling

68
00:02:43,803 --> 00:02:47,248
for me which is, not where I normally am.

69
00:02:47,248 --> 00:02:50,633
And it made me think
of something which is,

70
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:55,579
the way I do branding, I
sell so infrequently that

71
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:58,190
I think some of you that are
watching me the hardest core

72
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,981
need to hear this which
is, it's okay to sell

73
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,903
especially if you believe in something.

74
00:03:02,903 --> 00:03:04,762
Like if you believe in
what you're selling,

75
00:03:04,762 --> 00:03:06,528
and that's what I'm spending
a lot of time on now,

76
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:09,569
trying to spend more time
on really getting to a place

77
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:11,243
where I really believe in stuff

78
00:03:11,243 --> 00:03:13,290
instead of just passive not creating,

79
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,282
so I wasn't selling
'cause I didn't believe

80
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:17,379
you know and just letting
everything come to me.

81
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:19,856
But as I create these events,

82
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:22,331
Vayner experienced a lot of
events, very big on events,

83
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:25,325
events are so valuable, just
watching the Four D's crew,

84
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:27,329
its value and how it's
impacting their business

85
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:28,722
for $10,000, right?

86
00:03:28,722 --> 00:03:31,949
I know you're getting the emails.

87
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:35,813
The Wine Club, like $150
worth of wine for 55 bucks.

88
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:37,601
I've just locked in November's,

89
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:39,898
it's gonna make all your
Thanksgivings ridiculous.

90
00:03:39,898 --> 00:03:43,097
The conference, $500 two hour session

91
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:46,028
in my stomping grounds,
good deal compared to like

92
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:49,666
other conferences that I speak at.

93
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,128
But you're getting the wine for free.

94
00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:52,464
Or you're getting the talk for free

95
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:53,879
and you're getting the wine.

96
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,476
I'm very fascinated because
I'm putting more pressure

97
00:03:56,476 --> 00:04:00,671
on myself to create things
that I really believe in,

98
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:02,072
which then allows me to sell more

99
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:04,036
and I just think for a lot of you

100
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:07,103
selling the ask, the right
hook is very difficult.

101
00:04:07,103 --> 00:04:09,999
You're passive, you like
the idea of feeling good

102
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,982
about giving out content, this and that.

103
00:04:11,982 --> 00:04:15,051
When you believe in
something, you can sell it

104
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:16,863
and you should put more
pressure on yourself

105
00:04:16,863 --> 00:04:19,478
to create things that you believe in.

106
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:21,322
Biggest problem is so
many of you sell shit

107
00:04:21,322 --> 00:04:22,891
you don't believe in,
you're just doing it for

108
00:04:22,891 --> 00:04:25,993
the fuckin' money and
you're gonna fuckin' lose

109
00:04:25,993 --> 00:04:27,826
and that I don't like.

110
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:30,640
Let's go to London.

111
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,636
In the spirit of always
trying to add little hacks,

112
00:04:33,636 --> 00:04:37,480
tried something new on this London trip.

113
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,095
Usually we go late,

114
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:39,928
land

115
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:43,326
and it's like a whole tough day and so,

116
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:46,284
went early today to London,
land and now it's late here.

117
00:04:46,284 --> 00:04:47,558
Not as late at home.

118
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:50,487
My plan was to do a lot of work, land here

119
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:54,230
and then go to sleep and
just be in a good rhythm.

120
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,453
Unfortunately, haven't been
sleeping much as I'd like.

121
00:04:57,453 --> 00:05:00,419
By the way, real quick, always
getting six, seven, eight,

122
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,695
but got some fives and sixes and around,

123
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:04,341
got a little tired so,

124
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:06,454
had a glass of wine and conked out.

125
00:05:06,454 --> 00:05:08,490
It didn't work out but here's the point

126
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,684
why I'm sharing it with you,

127
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:13,770
need to try different things
and different patterns.

128
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,213
London wasn't working,
I wasn't as productive

129
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:18,329
and I was always very, very tired so

130
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:19,664
tried something new.

131
00:05:19,664 --> 00:05:21,973
Not exactly executing my game plan but

132
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:23,848
the fact that I'm trying something new

133
00:05:23,848 --> 00:05:25,848
makes it our y-positive.

134
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,600
10:14, the competitor business conference,

135
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:34,730
next post on Snapchat,
swipe it up, check it out.

136
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,147
Yo, what up vlog?

137
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,796
Here in Chinatown in London.

138
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:43,296
Driver explaining it to Jordan and D-Rock.

139
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,062
11:00 p.m. at night.

140
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:48,645
Same old, same old.

141
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,940
I wanna wrap this up very simply.

142
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,117
As much as things change,

143
00:05:54,117 --> 00:05:57,052
like fuckin' Shake Shack
in the middle of London,

144
00:05:57,052 --> 00:05:59,764
things stay the same and
for me that's very simple.

145
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:01,366
People innovating all around,

146
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:04,283
voice, Instagram, all that shit but

147
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:08,519
it's the grind, it's the message,

148
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:12,536
it's doing the right thing,
it's the context of the content,

149
00:06:12,536 --> 00:06:14,972
for the next 20 years, I'm
gonna say the same shit.

150
00:06:14,972 --> 00:06:17,297
The platforms are gonna change,

151
00:06:17,297 --> 00:06:21,775
your attention's gonna move
like that bag just moved but,

152
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:23,665
the game's the fuckin' same.

153
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:24,532
See ya.

154
00:06:24,532 --> 00:06:27,823
So I think when I get the praise,

155
00:06:27,823 --> 00:06:30,429
it's what the fuck does
that have to do me?

156
00:06:30,429 --> 00:06:33,739
When I get shit on, I'm like
that's on me and I'll fix it.

157
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:34,976
And I think those,

158
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:39,403
I said it really quick but
it's fuckin' accountability,

159
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:43,878
it's accountability and
ownership when you suck,

160
00:06:43,878 --> 00:06:48,045
and it's passing on the
credit when you fuckin' rule.

161
00:06:49,363 --> 00:06:50,957
And that's it.

162
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:53,121
And that's me and and that's my makeup.

163
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,590
And that's why I'm winning in life

164
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,219
and that's why I'm always gonna win

165
00:06:56,219 --> 00:07:00,419
because when you're
fucking 100% accountable

166
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,152
and you know your shit, you're garbage.

167
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:07,898
When your 100% accountable
when there's an issue,

168
00:07:07,898 --> 00:07:12,084
and when you pass on the
praise when you're getting it,

169
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:15,885
you become fundamentally
undefeated, unbeatable.

170
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:17,488
I'm straight up unbeatable

171
00:07:17,488 --> 00:07:21,579
because my head will never
get gassed up enough ever,

172
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:24,596
when I'm getting it good and,

173
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:26,958
and I'll never believe it's me,

174
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,950
and when it's bad, I'll never point

175
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,470
the fuckin' finger to anybody else.

176
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,426
All you fuckin' fingerpointers,

177
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:36,211
pointing everywhere, everybody's
fuckin' pointing fingers,

178
00:07:36,211 --> 00:07:37,488
pointing them everywhere.

179
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:39,617
It's everybody's fuckin'
fault but yourself.

180
00:07:39,617 --> 00:07:42,472
Your country, your
environment, your parents,

181
00:07:42,472 --> 00:07:45,625
your school system, your boss, your aunt,

182
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,535
your fuckin' circumstances and of course,

183
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:52,136
and of course there's tragedies and crimes

184
00:07:52,136 --> 00:07:55,754
and child abuse and real bad stuff.

185
00:07:55,754 --> 00:07:57,428
I'm not saying it's not real.

186
00:07:57,428 --> 00:08:01,135
I'm saying for the 95% of
you, it's a mindset thing.

187
00:08:01,135 --> 00:08:05,006
Perspective, perspective's everything.

188
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:07,296
I'm grounded in my perspective.

189
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:10,106
Never too high, never too low.

190
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:11,388
It's about them when it's good,

191
00:08:11,388 --> 00:08:12,904
it's about me when it's bad.

192
00:08:12,904 --> 00:08:14,405
That's me.

193
00:08:14,405 --> 00:08:15,988
That's what I got for you.

194
00:08:15,988 --> 00:08:18,255
That's where I'm at, that's my mindset

195
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:19,980
and I never waver.

196
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,578
It's a fucking 100%, never fuckin' waver.

197
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:24,161
I have my bad days,

198
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,794
but I keep that shit to myself.

199
00:08:30,794 --> 00:08:34,544
("Unstoppable" by The Score)

200
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,820
So what's going on?

201
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:45,304
Let me answer some questions now.

202
00:08:45,304 --> 00:00:00,000
What can I help you guys with?
