1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,850
- Days you just fuckin' feel it

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,900
and often times when I'm
rushed in a quick moment,

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,554
and a short Q&A or a fireside chat,

4
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:10,830
I come out guns a-blazing.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,663
There's just something about

6
00:00:11,663 --> 00:00:13,680
Baron Davis' All-Star Weekend kinda moment

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,313
that brought out a real
passion in my stomach.

8
00:00:17,313 --> 00:00:19,524
And this was the result.

9
00:00:19,524 --> 00:00:20,629
- [Announcers] Gary V!

10
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:23,046
(applauding)

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,072
- [Gary] Where do you want me?

12
00:00:32,072 --> 00:00:32,905
- Sit right there.

13
00:00:32,905 --> 00:00:34,402
Sit right there, sit right there.

14
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:36,431
Too many mics, too many mics.

15
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:37,264
How you feelin'?

16
00:00:37,264 --> 00:00:38,967
- I'm feelin' tremendous.

17
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:41,320
If you told me that I was gonna have Gunna

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,087
introduce me on stage,
I was gonna feel really

19
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:44,340
good about,

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,890
what's up, Mitt?

21
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,710
- Wow we have Gary V here,

22
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,200
for those in the room, the
small amount who don't know

23
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,140
who this man is,

24
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,049
which would be a small amount,

25
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:56,070
Gary Vaynerchuk is an entreprenuer,

26
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,570
a leader,

27
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,420
a creator of brand,

28
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,350
a father, and a husband

29
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,768
and just a great guy.

30
00:01:02,768 --> 00:01:05,260
What, for the five

31
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,280
in two minutes, tell 'em who you are.

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,190
- I'm an entrepreneur.

33
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,570
I was born in Belarus in
the former Soviet Union,

34
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,760
came to the States,

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,500
lived in a studio apartment in Queens

36
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,160
with seven family members.

37
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,484
I came from shit, from the gutter, right?

38
00:01:19,484 --> 00:01:21,910
I was also a D and F student,

39
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,574
so in the '80s and '90s,

40
00:01:23,574 --> 00:01:25,600
education was the only way out.

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,706
Entrepreneurship wasn't
this thing that is now

42
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:30,900
that we give a fuck about.

43
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,560
And so, basically, for the
first 17 years of my life,

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,610
I was told that I was
losing, that I wasn't good,

45
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,100
and you know,

46
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,550
between DNA and more importantly,

47
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,889
a all-time mother and father,

48
00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:45,960
I was in my own head.

49
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,490
I thought I was good.

50
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,230
I was making two, three
thousand dollars a weekend

51
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,610
selling baseball cards when I was 13.

52
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,110
So I was struggling to understand

53
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,860
why I was gonna be a fuckin' loser.

54
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,868
(audience laughs)

55
00:01:58,868 --> 00:01:59,701
- Right?

56
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:00,725
Preach.

57
00:02:00,725 --> 00:02:02,110
- It just made no sense, right?

58
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,900
Teachers were like, you're gonna suck,

59
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,585
I'm like, I make more
money than you, dick!

60
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:07,690
(audience laughs)

61
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,120
So,

62
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,020
you know, entrepreneurship
wasn't that thing

63
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,452
that it is today.

64
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:13,670
I was grinding.

65
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,480
My dad at that point saved all his money,

66
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,030
bought a liquor store,

67
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,950
made the American Dream for our family,

68
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,350
I went into that business,

69
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,230
and over the first 12 years of my career

70
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,640
from 22 to 34, I built my
dad's business for him.

71
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,540
Had no equity in it,

72
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,870
built my dad's business from a three to a

73
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,730
60 million dollar business,

74
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,090
and then I left,

75
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:33,510
and started VaynerMedia.

76
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,034
In between, after being right about e-comm

77
00:02:36,034 --> 00:02:38,920
about email and Google,

78
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,490
I wasn't gonna let it pass me by

79
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,130
and when I saw the next big thing,

80
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,890
that ended up being social media.

81
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,040
So, I was an early investor in Twitter

82
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,860
and Facebook and Tumblr.

83
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,770
So,

84
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,704
I'm rich.

85
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:52,915
(audience laughs)

86
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:55,421
- Had to have that part, he's rich.

87
00:02:55,421 --> 00:02:56,421
- He's rich.

88
00:02:57,498 --> 00:02:58,331
But,

89
00:03:00,062 --> 00:03:01,662
can I work for you?

90
00:03:01,662 --> 00:03:03,820
I'm trying to work for this guy.

91
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,420
But talk about, you know, like,

92
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,230
when you were running your dad's business.

93
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,063
- Yeah.

94
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,220
- Right?

95
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,190
And knowing that you're an entrepreneur,

96
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,842
and you're not running it for yourself.

97
00:03:12,842 --> 00:03:13,675
- Yeah.

98
00:03:13,675 --> 00:03:14,950
- What are the tools that you learned

99
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,980
to be able to even catch a wave,

100
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,320
or to leave something that you grew

101
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,305
into a $60 million dollar business.

102
00:03:21,305 --> 00:03:23,130
- It's interesting to hear Chris up here,

103
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,630
talking about people thinking that they

104
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,230
can be athletes or be better
at basketball than him.

105
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,300
That's what I feel is
happening with entrepreneurship

106
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,780
right now, right?

107
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,360
Everybody's got Entrepreneur
in their Instagram profile.

108
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,150
But there's a big fuckin'
difference between

109
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,910
being a successful entrepreneur,

110
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,978
and being one.

111
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:42,231
- Amen.

112
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:44,133
(audience applauds)

113
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:45,710
- I see a lot of people
who think they can play

114
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,679
- A lot of people didn't want to clap

115
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:49,219
(laughs)

116
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:50,562
like, I got that on my profile too.

117
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:53,395
(audience laughs)

118
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,479
- So,

119
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,490
for me,

120
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,965
for me it was the work, right?

121
00:03:59,965 --> 00:04:02,270
I see my man Dunk here,

122
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,220
he's putting in the work,

123
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,961
he's a youngster, he makes

124
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:07,260
look old, right?

125
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,330
People,

126
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,310
there's a few that are
coming up that actually

127
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,143
want the work.

128
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:12,710
The way I thought about it was

129
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,600
I gave up all my 20's.

130
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,433
Right?

131
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:18,540
Your actions have to match your ambitions.

132
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,373
Right?

133
00:04:19,373 --> 00:04:20,269
People are talking a lot of shit,

134
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,102
but not putting in the work.

135
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:22,019
Here's my life.

136
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,760
From 22 to 30, I lived in New Jersey.

137
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,560
I worked 15 hours a day,
Monday through Saturday,

138
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,000
I got rest on Sunday and saw my family.

139
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,160
I never went out.

140
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,870
I didn't buy dumb shit to
make me look cool to girls,

141
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,090
and I fuckin' put in work and I got skills

142
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,890
and I put them to use in my 30's,

143
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,620
and now I'm 42, young as fuck,

144
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,420
I'm gonna buy the Jets,
win seven Super Bowls

145
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,490
and call it a day!

146
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,157
(audience cheers, applause)

147
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,520
But the reason, and by the way,

148
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,790
I don't think it's cool
that I gave up all my 20's,

149
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,870
contrary, I'm sad, I get it.

150
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,700
I gave 'em up though because

151
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,130
I didn't want to be a hypocrite.

152
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,330
I have big ambitions, I want it.

153
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,950
And I thought that was a
time when I would have the

154
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,960
most flexibility to put in all the work.

155
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,611
- But I mean, that's
entrepreneurship, right?

156
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:11,611
- That's anything great!

157
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:14,000
- You're gonna lose out.

158
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,820
You're gonna miss something, right?

159
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,807
But, you have to work, you know,

160
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:18,810
you have to have a vision.

161
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,680
- To that point,

162
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,610
at the cross-section that we are here,

163
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,320
there's nobody that
makes it into the league

164
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,961
without sacrificing things.

165
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:27,550
And I think successful entrepreneurs

166
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,383
is the league.

167
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:30,190
There's nobody who's hit it,

168
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,200
who did it, who got lucky.

169
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,830
People love lucky.

170
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,510
People love excuses.

171
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,570
You're in control of your shit.

172
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,090
The internet's changed everything.

173
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,720
Every excuse coming out of your mouth,

174
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,410
the answer is, And?

175
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,550
Because the internet
has changed everything.

176
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,150
We haven't calibrated how big it is.

177
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,470
There's no middle man, there's no system,

178
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,220
they're no old White dude stopping you.

179
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,530
Go do your thing.

180
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,040
This internet thing is real as fuck,

181
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,310
and so for me, I just think it's the

182
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,870
greatest time to be alive.

183
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,810
And if you're not winning during this era,

184
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,863
of internet at scale, and
fuckin' nine straight years

185
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:04,620
of economic growth, then you suck!

186
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,923
- That's real talk.

187
00:06:07,923 --> 00:06:08,756
Shit.

188
00:06:08,756 --> 00:06:11,089
(crosstalk)

189
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,430
This is how we doin' it.

190
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,130
- This is real game.

191
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:15,963
- I mean, 'cause look,

192
00:06:15,963 --> 00:06:17,080
how many people under 30?

193
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,160
Raise your hands.

194
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,683
- Damn.

195
00:06:21,671 --> 00:06:22,504
- So one of the things I hate

196
00:06:22,504 --> 00:06:23,882
is that people shit on millennials,

197
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:24,758
they're the same,

198
00:06:24,758 --> 00:06:27,520
everybody's the same,
you knew lazy people,

199
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,803
you knew hard working people.

200
00:06:28,803 --> 00:06:31,460
Millennials have so many advantages,

201
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,006
under 30 has so many advantages.

202
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:36,030
Actually the only disadvantage
I think they have,

203
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,310
is they haven't been
punched in the mouth yet.

204
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,143
Right?

205
00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:40,690
They haven't lived through 2008,

206
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,560
or 2001.

207
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,860
There's a lot of people in here

208
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,560
over 40, who are rich on paper,

209
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,800
or had made it in 2001, 2006,

210
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,070
and then the economy got fucked, right?

211
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,390
It's real cool when you're
an Instagram influencer,

212
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,470
and making $100,000 dollars
in sponsorship deals,

213
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,660
until the world melts,

214
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,210
and those brands aren't paying.

215
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,101
So, my big fear right now is

216
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:05,297
be smart, be thoughtful,

217
00:07:05,297 --> 00:07:07,840
build something that you can control.

218
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,030
Everybody crying about Instagram
and Facebook's algorithm,

219
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,620
it was free!

220
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,976
You built on it for free!

221
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:14,809
- That's right.

222
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,315
- So they changed it because the attention

223
00:07:16,315 --> 00:07:18,190
of that user is everything.

224
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,250
It's what matters.

225
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,281
And so they're gonna do
what's right for them.

226
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:24,360
If you're crying that your
organic reach dropped,

227
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,193
then fuckin' work!

228
00:07:25,193 --> 00:07:27,020
Start a fuckin' podcast,

229
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,450
fuckin' start a newsletter,

230
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,010
do something instead
of crying that you got

231
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,200
7,000 likes instead of
11,000, you fuckin' loser.

232
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,358
(audience laughs, claps)

233
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:37,191
It's true!

234
00:07:40,846 --> 00:07:42,210
I mean, it's true!

235
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,150
It was free!

236
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,800
People are like, oh my
shit's fucked up now,

237
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,740
I don't have as much engagement,

238
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,390
I'm like, it was free!

239
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:49,829
- Right.

240
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:51,353
- Let me switch gears.

241
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:52,186
- Go ahead.

242
00:07:52,186 --> 00:07:53,632
(audience laughs)

243
00:07:53,632 --> 00:07:55,142
- Someone's hurt right now.

244
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,100
Some of y'all here hurt!

245
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,040
What's Gary V

246
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,110
- By the way, real quick, James,

247
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,330
I know a lot of people here don't know me.

248
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,350
I'm not trying to hurt or be funny,

249
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,322
I'm trying to help you.

250
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:05,810
Never be at the mercy of something

251
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,850
you don't control!

252
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,063
- That's right.
- Right.

253
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:08,896
(applauding)

254
00:08:08,896 --> 00:08:10,438
- That's real talk!

255
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:12,340
(applauding)

256
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,790
- If there was one thing that you can say

257
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,210
that you want to see happen
over the next five years,

258
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,010
for yourself or for your business,

259
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,700
also from an impact standpoint,

260
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,430
what your business has
the capabilities of doing.

261
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,880
Where do you see that, what is that?

262
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,713
- One thing,

263
00:08:31,713 --> 00:08:32,659
what are you doing in sports?

264
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,350
Like why are you here?

265
00:08:34,351 --> 00:08:36,690
- I'm here 'cause all of culture

266
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,275
is here this weekend, right?

267
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:41,250
L.A. NBA All-Star is like,

268
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,690
I don't work on weekends.

269
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,500
I don't miss family time on weekends

270
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,510
'cause I work so hard,

271
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,000
but this was just can't miss.

272
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,640
Obviously, VaynerSports,

273
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,780
my brother AJ and I have started a

274
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,600
sports representation business.

275
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,870
We think we're gonna disrupt it,

276
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,200
I can go into that.

277
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,770
But I'm here because culture is here.

278
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,050
'Cause Chris's point is right,

279
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,640
the NBA has done it so right

280
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,370
because the faces are seen,

281
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,640
because they're not

282
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,967
baseball, Bam made a lot
of money for the owners

283
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:07,457
in the short term, but in the long term,

284
00:09:07,457 --> 00:09:09,240
the three best players in baseball

285
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,410
can walk down this street right now naked

286
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,921
and nobody would give a fuck.

287
00:09:12,921 --> 00:09:13,754
(laughs)

288
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:14,650
That's bad.

289
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,610
That plays out.

290
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,430
- I mean, baseball players,
they pretty in shape, dude.

291
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,263
I don't think

292
00:09:19,263 --> 00:09:20,482
(audience laughs)

293
00:09:20,482 --> 00:09:21,315
- I see what you're saying.

294
00:09:21,315 --> 00:09:22,148
Like, physically.

295
00:09:24,217 --> 00:09:25,866
I get it.
- All-Star Weekend

296
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,236
- I get it, I get it.

297
00:09:27,236 --> 00:09:28,403
But, you know,

298
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,730
to answer your question,

299
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,270
my number one objective
right now in general

300
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:38,250
is to make good traits alpha.

301
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,300
So, what I'm real
passionate about right now

302
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,960
is making empathy and
gratitude and kindness

303
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,930
cool as fuck.

304
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,773
- [Female Audience Member] You know what?

305
00:09:45,773 --> 00:09:46,606
Shit.

306
00:09:46,606 --> 00:09:47,730
- Speak on that.

307
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,590
- You like that?

308
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,650
- That's the black term for like,

309
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,588
go ahead and preach.
- I know what it is.

310
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:52,629
(audience laughs, applauds)

311
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:53,942
I know what it was.

312
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:54,775
So,

313
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,450
I know exactly what it was.

314
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,726
And I wanted her to expand on it,

315
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:05,156
because to her point,

316
00:10:05,156 --> 00:10:06,890
that's the most important thing right now.

317
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,730
We have a very interesting time.

318
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,740
Chris mentioned it.

319
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,586
And this is what's going
on in my life, right?

320
00:10:11,586 --> 00:10:13,770
Athletes want to be rappers,

321
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,950
rappers want to be athletes,

322
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,010
and now everybody wants
to be an entrepreneur.

323
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:17,843
Right?

324
00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:18,860
By the way, let me give you a headline.

325
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,880
This is only gonna last
five to seven years,

326
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,420
'cause when shit melts and
everybody has to get a job,

327
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,450
they're gonna say fuck
that entrepreneur shit.

328
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,840
So, it's got a moment.

329
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,110
They'll come back in 40 years

330
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,140
but this is the moment.

331
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,030
And while I'm sitting where I'm sitting

332
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,240
in that moment,

333
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,760
I'm gonna try to do some good with it.

334
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,220
And here's what's good,

335
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,410
doing the right thing is
always the right thing.

336
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,580
There's a lot of people
that don't understand

337
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,450
how business really works.

338
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,470
Have leverage, you want to have leverage?

339
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,460
Give more than you take.

340
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,600
That's how you win.
- Wow.

341
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,910
- And these are just truths.

342
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,743
- Yeah.
- And then it

343
00:10:48,743 --> 00:10:49,576
manifests in business.

344
00:10:49,576 --> 00:10:51,690
I'm leaving real fuckin' economics

345
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,320
on the table every year

346
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,680
because I'm gaining points.

347
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,590
Leverage, leverage, leverage.

348
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,970
Get smart about who
you're doing that with,

349
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,192
and you can build
something very meaningful.

350
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:02,608
- Ladies and gentlemen!

351
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:03,862
(audience applauding)

352
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:05,270
- Gary V!

353
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,608
Gary V

354
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:09,775
(audience applauding)

355
00:11:12,063 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Gary] Have a good weekend.
