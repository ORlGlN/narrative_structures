1
00:00:00,348 --> 00:00:02,635
- And by the way, by the way, real quick.

2
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:03,468
- [Person On Phone] Mhm.

3
00:00:03,468 --> 00:00:05,406
- I don't expect any of
you to take this advice

4
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:07,034
cuz it's too scary.

5
00:00:07,034 --> 00:00:08,216
(laughing)

6
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,453
But I really hope I can
inspire one of you to do it

7
00:00:10,453 --> 00:00:12,936
because it's exactly how you
get a job at Vayner Media

8
00:00:12,936 --> 00:00:14,730
which would be a much
better place to get a job

9
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,105
than any other agency in this city.

10
00:00:17,105 --> 00:00:20,772
(heavy drum and bass music)

11
00:00:23,627 --> 00:00:27,149
(Skype call rings)

12
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:27,982
Hey guys

13
00:00:27,982 --> 00:00:28,815
um

14
00:00:28,815 --> 00:00:29,648
so thanks for having me in class.

15
00:00:29,648 --> 00:00:31,802
A couple things that are
running through my mind

16
00:00:31,802 --> 00:00:33,109
that I wanna start with.

17
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:34,004
First of all

18
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:34,905
I think

19
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:37,920
when you start talking
about digital and social

20
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,724
it's super important to understand

21
00:00:39,724 --> 00:00:40,830
that

22
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,927
um

23
00:00:41,927 --> 00:00:44,209
it's really about attention, right?

24
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:46,039
It's not necessarily digital or social.

25
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,815
I'm not overly romantic or
passionate about Facebook

26
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,305
or Instagram or Skype or

27
00:00:51,305 --> 00:00:52,606
Youtube.

28
00:00:52,606 --> 00:00:53,439
Uh

29
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,169
to me it's just where do
I think the attention is

30
00:00:55,169 --> 00:00:56,684
and where do I think that it's overpriced

31
00:00:56,684 --> 00:00:58,608
and where do I think
that it's underpriced.

32
00:00:58,608 --> 00:01:01,513
And my fascination with
digital or social is

33
00:01:01,513 --> 00:01:03,271
a lot of it is underpriced

34
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,531
but to be very frank a
lot of it is overpriced.

35
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:07,979
When (censored) is a market
and that other people

36
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,827
have to deal with in big companies is

37
00:01:09,827 --> 00:01:11,634
they have to measure things

38
00:01:11,634 --> 00:01:14,459
and put them into data and reports.

39
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:17,557
And what I have the
luxury of is to trade on

40
00:01:17,557 --> 00:01:18,640
intuition and

41
00:01:19,524 --> 00:01:21,032
um, and

42
00:01:21,032 --> 00:01:22,905
other cultural variables

43
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:24,371
that give me my decisions.

44
00:01:24,371 --> 00:01:26,078
Plus, I'm running a marathon

45
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:28,319
while a lot of people
are running a sprint.

46
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,699
What I mean by that, class, is

47
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:33,170
I don't have to pay under to
the short term profit margins

48
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,851
that big companies and
small companies have to

49
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:39,968
because I'm not incentivized
by dollars in the short term

50
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:41,270
I'm looking for the long term.

51
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,938
And so, what does that all mean?

52
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:44,997
It means that I've been very passionate

53
00:01:44,997 --> 00:01:46,752
about being historically correct.

54
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,988
Whether that was Email
or search or YouTube

55
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:53,330
or Twitter or Facebook or podcasting or

56
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,008
whatever it may be.

57
00:01:55,008 --> 00:01:56,838
And so, for me it's very binary

58
00:01:56,838 --> 00:01:58,095
very black and white.

59
00:01:58,095 --> 00:02:01,443
What's a good use of my time
and money and what is not.

60
00:02:01,443 --> 00:02:02,868
As we sit in this room today

61
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:05,593
there are certain things that overindex

62
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:07,179
and certain things that underindex.

63
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:08,012
So for example

64
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:09,173
digital.

65
00:02:09,173 --> 00:02:10,108
I can love digital

66
00:02:10,108 --> 00:02:11,865
but I know none of you are watching

67
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:15,103
the majority of prerolls
that you get targeted by

68
00:02:15,103 --> 00:02:18,278
none of you are clicking on banner ads

69
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:20,961
none of you are carefully reading emails

70
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:25,192
none of you want spam texts in your texts.

71
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:29,632
You're not excited about ads
that are being read to you

72
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:32,356
broken up when you're
listening to Pandora.

73
00:02:32,356 --> 00:02:33,189
Um

74
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:34,843
you definitely don't like a midroll ad

75
00:02:34,843 --> 00:02:36,774
when you're watching YouTube vlog

76
00:02:36,774 --> 00:02:39,799
and all of a sudden there's
a car ad in the middle

77
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:44,239
with this shell that's super
shocking, it makes no sense.

78
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,312
So there's a ton of terrible digital.

79
00:02:46,312 --> 00:02:48,021
At the same token

80
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:50,548
I think everybody's going
through their feeds on Facebook

81
00:02:50,548 --> 00:02:51,881
and uh Instagram

82
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:56,575
and that they are grossly
underpriced for now.

83
00:02:56,575 --> 00:02:59,257
I think a lot of you will
start to tune out feeds

84
00:02:59,257 --> 00:03:00,192
in a decade

85
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:02,835
but for now it's super underpriced.

86
00:03:02,835 --> 00:03:05,401
And that's because the
biggest brands in the world

87
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:07,636
don't spend enough
money in these channels.

88
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:10,612
Pepsi or Toyota or BMW or GE.

89
00:03:10,612 --> 00:03:12,083
I just don't think they spend enough

90
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,427
in Facebook or Instagram.

91
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:14,525
And you have to understand this

92
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:18,823
unlike other digital properties
like VICE or Refinery29

93
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:19,806
where there's

94
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:22,092
where there's a basement of costs.

95
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:23,769
There is none of that

96
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:25,719
on Facebook and Instagram and Snapchat

97
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,317
because they're marketplaces, right?

98
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:28,825
So.

99
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:33,555
If you go to a publisher like
Turner or CBS or BuzzFeed

100
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:37,021
there's a minimum threshold
before they'll work with you

101
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:39,633
because they're running a smart business.

102
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:40,974
But on Facebook

103
00:03:40,974 --> 00:03:44,673
all of us can run $7 worth
of ads on there, right now.

104
00:03:44,673 --> 00:03:47,278
We can all run $7 worth of ads right now

105
00:03:47,278 --> 00:03:48,949
and I think that's a very big deal.

106
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:50,703
Very important to understand

107
00:03:50,703 --> 00:03:53,202
because when you understand the market

108
00:03:53,202 --> 00:03:55,042
the aspects of the market

109
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:57,851
and what a true marketplace is

110
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:01,634
it leads to overpriced
and underpriced variables.

111
00:04:01,634 --> 00:04:03,705
There's good and bad deals.

112
00:04:03,705 --> 00:04:06,140
And so things I'm spending
my time on right now are

113
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,009
Snapchats are being left for dead

114
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:10,788
yet the ad product is really underpriced

115
00:04:10,788 --> 00:04:13,441
for people under 30 in America.

116
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:16,365
If you're 40 to 70 on Facebook

117
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:18,480
you're a very good target for ads

118
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,759
very inexpensive in my opinion.

119
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:21,858
Um

120
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:22,691
you know

121
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:26,230
Instagram's incredible
for culture 18 to 35

122
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,960
very underpriced, the ad product.

123
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,867
The influencers on Instagram
are unbelievably underpriced

124
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:33,950
for 18 to 35.

125
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:39,381
18 to 45 on the coasts,
15 to 35 in the middle.

126
00:04:39,381 --> 00:04:40,359
Um

127
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:41,662
so

128
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:44,162
I'm just completely passionate

129
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:47,511
that digital, if you wanna call it

130
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:49,595
is the right answer for
a lot of you in this room

131
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:51,432
to do marketing and build businesses on.

132
00:04:51,432 --> 00:04:53,480
I'm just warning that 80% of digital

133
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,435
can be spent on garbage.

134
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:57,109
And so I think the landmine

135
00:04:57,109 --> 00:04:59,102
that you guys need to be thinking about

136
00:04:59,102 --> 00:05:01,709
the landmine that you guys
need to be thinking about is

137
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:03,746
is it a good deal or a bad deal

138
00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:06,109
and that's what I would spend
all my time on as a marketer

139
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:08,800
and as an executor in this environment.

140
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,626
And I think there's a
big disconnect between

141
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:12,212
the best and the worst.

142
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,534
I think the best comes
from entrepreneurs that are

143
00:05:14,534 --> 00:05:15,367
you know

144
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:16,200
stuck.

145
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,066
Good entrepreneurs

146
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,111
cuz a lot of entrepreneurs
are terrible at marketing

147
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,295
but good entrepreneurs that are stuck

148
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:22,166
and need every penny to work hard.

149
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,180
And I think the worst are

150
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,200
the biggest brands in the world

151
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,913
that have tons of flush money

152
00:05:25,913 --> 00:05:27,172
and are just mailing it in

153
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:29,997
and are putting a lot
of money in bad places.

154
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:33,012
So that is my thesis, class

155
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:35,697
and I'd love to answer some questions.

156
00:05:35,697 --> 00:05:37,169
- [Woman on phone] Creative, as well as

157
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:40,609
making sure that they're
the most receptive

158
00:05:40,609 --> 00:05:43,755
which is why we're
investing in a lot of merch.

159
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:46,156
You mentioned there were
some limitations, right?

160
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:49,978
I also worked for a boss that
worked the EPIC film, right?

161
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:52,301
So we've talked here about the trade off

162
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:54,861
between long form and short form content.

163
00:05:54,861 --> 00:05:56,490
- Yeah, so class.

164
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,036
Long form, short form.

165
00:05:58,036 --> 00:05:59,472
It's a very big debate

166
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:01,316
and it makes a lot of sense to Linda and I

167
00:06:01,316 --> 00:06:02,149
we're in it every day.

168
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:03,556
But let me get to the punchline.

169
00:06:03,556 --> 00:06:05,876
There are shitty six second vines

170
00:06:05,876 --> 00:06:08,938
and I would watch a
seven hour Star Wars film

171
00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:10,733
because it's Star Wars.

172
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:14,229
I would say that the length
is far less a variable

173
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:16,060
than people make it out to be

174
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,280
because we need to talk more about--

175
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,900
we need to talk more about
the quality of the content

176
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,549
in the context of the platform.

177
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,299
So, in an ideal world

178
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,828
um, you know

179
00:06:27,828 --> 00:06:30,690
we would make incredible
content that's a minute

180
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,657
minutes of great context.

181
00:06:32,657 --> 00:06:34,206
Great little stuff.

182
00:06:34,206 --> 00:06:37,825
I love three minute videos
if they keep your attention

183
00:06:37,825 --> 00:06:41,325
I love six second videos if
it can get the point across.

184
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:43,073
It's a variable

185
00:06:43,073 --> 00:06:47,317
but it's been very overstated
in debating the length.

186
00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:48,415
To me it's--

187
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:52,984
to me it's the context of
the content to the audience

188
00:06:52,984 --> 00:06:54,651
that it's targeting.

189
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,959
This is a pretty gangster move.

190
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,139
The Skype started not working

191
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:10,235
so I'm just gonna get
a quick tweet promotion

192
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:12,318
of the new episode going.

193
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:15,354
[Skype Rings] That's better!

194
00:07:15,354 --> 00:07:17,476
- [Linda, Via Computer
Skype] Yeah, okay, so ready?

195
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:19,839
Here's the class again,
you can see everybody.

196
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,298
I asked them in advance to
think of questions for you.

197
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:25,712
So we're gonna see who has a question.

198
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,136
- [Parker] Hi, what's going on.

199
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:29,505
Big Hot Ones fan, Gary, nice to meet you.

200
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:31,092
My name's Parker and this is Ryan.

201
00:07:31,092 --> 00:07:35,214
So I wanted to ask you
specifically about transparency--

202
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:36,047
- Yes.

203
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:37,569
- In regards to digital marketing.

204
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:39,967
So on platforms like
Instagram, Facebook, YouTube

205
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:41,754
do you think going
forward that transparency

206
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:43,056
is the most important thing

207
00:07:43,056 --> 00:07:44,598
just so that the advertisements

208
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:45,534
that they're putting up there

209
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:47,128
can function as they're suppose to?

210
00:07:47,128 --> 00:07:47,961
- So--

211
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:49,578
- Also, going along with that

212
00:07:49,578 --> 00:07:50,430
just wanted to say

213
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,144
cleanest bones in Hot Ones

214
00:07:52,144 --> 00:07:53,159
- Yes, yes.

215
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,553
- Cleanest bones.

216
00:07:54,553 --> 00:07:55,737
- I love it.

217
00:07:55,737 --> 00:07:56,597
Uh

218
00:07:56,597 --> 00:07:57,619
thank you for that.

219
00:07:57,619 --> 00:08:01,007
Literally being known as
cleanest bones by YouTube

220
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:02,633
is greater than being on the cover

221
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:05,362
of Entrepreneur Magazine
so thank you for that.

222
00:08:05,362 --> 00:08:06,744
(laughing)

223
00:08:06,744 --> 00:08:09,024
So let's define transparency

224
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:11,502
because people throw it
around in a lot of ways.

225
00:08:11,502 --> 00:08:14,193
How do you define, what's the rub?

226
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,454
What do you think the rub is?

227
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,003
What are you focused on?

228
00:08:17,003 --> 00:08:18,510
- Right so for Facebook

229
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,851
I know it's really important that recently

230
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:21,922
they announced that they were
going to start announcing

231
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:24,078
that the ad is from a Russian source.

232
00:08:24,078 --> 00:08:25,833
Or on YouTube I know there's a big scandal

233
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,070
back in like early 2010, 2011

234
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,634
when uh, Microsoft was paying YouTubers

235
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:32,341
but they weren't announcing it.

236
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:33,258
- Oh I see.

237
00:08:34,258 --> 00:08:35,234
Yeah I mean look, look.

238
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:36,865
I think, I think that

239
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:38,596
on the surface

240
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:40,067
everybody in this class is gonna be like

241
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:42,076
yay transparency, right?

242
00:08:42,076 --> 00:08:44,272
I think in real life

243
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:46,667
everybody in this classroom
would be devastated

244
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:50,416
on how much they don't give
a shit about transparency.

245
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,351
Like, like.

246
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:53,464
Humans are very funny, right?

247
00:08:53,464 --> 00:08:55,089
We talk about things

248
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:56,634
lemme give you an example.

249
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:58,541
Everybody loves to talk
about the environment.

250
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,022
In this class, everybody
in this class right now

251
00:09:01,022 --> 00:09:03,015
when I talk about oil companies

252
00:09:03,015 --> 00:09:05,009
would be like boo, right?

253
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:06,761
(class laughs)

254
00:09:06,761 --> 00:09:08,870
The sweater that you're
wearing right now, bro

255
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,386
which is super fashionable, good job.

256
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:12,364
- Do you know how many people died

257
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:13,545
to make this sweater?

258
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:14,560
- It's not even that

259
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,780
do you wanna hear something interesting?

260
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,613
- Sure.

261
00:09:16,613 --> 00:09:20,431
- That company is doing a
ton worse to the environment.

262
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:21,787
Textiles is destroying our environment.

263
00:09:21,787 --> 00:09:23,037
- I believe it.

264
00:09:25,163 --> 00:09:26,637
- Do you think everybody in this room

265
00:09:26,637 --> 00:09:29,202
wants to give up their
Yeezy's and their Supremes?

266
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,707
(class laughs)

267
00:09:30,707 --> 00:09:31,811
So

268
00:09:31,811 --> 00:09:33,362
lemme tell you what I think.

269
00:09:33,362 --> 00:09:36,546
I think that 90% of
the stuff we talk about

270
00:09:36,546 --> 00:09:38,215
doesn't match our actions.

271
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:39,110
Right?

272
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,246
So, I think transparency is
super important for up side

273
00:09:43,246 --> 00:09:44,638
not down side.

274
00:09:44,638 --> 00:09:46,109
I think what it's

275
00:09:46,109 --> 00:09:47,370
what's good for it

276
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,675
puts hashtag ad

277
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:50,381
is that it gets the benefit.

278
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,274
I think that nobody here
would do real fucking research

279
00:09:53,274 --> 00:09:55,023
to figure out the Microsoft YouTube thing

280
00:09:55,023 --> 00:09:57,606
that nobody gives a shit about.

281
00:09:59,277 --> 00:10:00,165
- Okay. Thank you so much.

282
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:01,181
- You got it.

283
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:03,027
- [Linda] Alright let's
go to the next row.

284
00:10:03,027 --> 00:10:04,011
- Let's do it.

285
00:10:04,011 --> 00:10:05,575
- [Man On Computer] Hi, Gary.

286
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:06,513
- Hi Guys.

287
00:10:06,513 --> 00:10:08,442
- We share a birthday, I'm a huge fan.

288
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,702
- Thank you.

289
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:10,678
- So question.

290
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:11,980
I know you're a huge Knicks fan

291
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,327
and the idea this year

292
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:15,945
is they introduced the
sponsors on the jersey.

293
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:17,868
And so I, myself, am a big NBA fan

294
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,424
I'm also a huge cycling fan.

295
00:10:19,424 --> 00:10:22,673
So cycling teams are do
or die, sponsors are named

296
00:10:22,673 --> 00:10:24,262
after everything.

297
00:10:24,262 --> 00:10:25,239
- Yep.

298
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:26,656
- So do you think

299
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:28,996
obviously the Big Four has sponsors

300
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:30,223
but do you think this is a trend

301
00:10:30,223 --> 00:10:31,460
that we're gonna see continued

302
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,011
where sponsors are on the jersey

303
00:10:33,011 --> 00:10:34,358
or sponsors are on the helmets--

304
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:35,425
- Yes.

305
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:36,258
- You do?

306
00:10:36,258 --> 00:10:37,187
- Yep.

307
00:10:37,187 --> 00:10:39,067
- Where do you think it's gonna go?

308
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:41,552
How far do you think it's gonna go?

309
00:10:41,552 --> 00:10:44,108
- I think the NBA jersey in 16 years

310
00:10:44,108 --> 00:10:47,024
could look like a soccer jersey.

311
00:10:47,024 --> 00:10:48,204
- Interesting.

312
00:10:48,204 --> 00:10:49,465
- I think, I think

313
00:10:49,465 --> 00:10:51,669
I think it's gonna be a game of

314
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:55,296
some sports are gonna go
with the WalMart model

315
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:58,474
and some sports will go with
the kind of Cartier model.

316
00:10:58,474 --> 00:10:59,307
Right?

317
00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:01,687
Like I could see the NFL doing one logo

318
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:02,908
like the NBA right now

319
00:11:02,908 --> 00:11:04,171
uh

320
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:06,488
and I could see the NBA
going with six logos

321
00:11:06,488 --> 00:11:09,678
and baseball being two
and hockey being one

322
00:11:09,678 --> 00:11:10,511
and you know.

323
00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:12,437
We also have to figure out in 20 years

324
00:11:12,437 --> 00:11:13,270
you know

325
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,789
esports and MMA and
things of that you know.

326
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:18,327
The Big Four, hockey's
not a Big Four, right?

327
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:19,510
- No, not anymore.

328
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,249
- And so, how does it play out?

329
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:25,102
Like baseball took all
the short term money

330
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,117
by creating BAM.

331
00:11:26,117 --> 00:11:28,130
None of you can find a
YouTube video or Instagram

332
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:28,963
about baseball

333
00:11:28,963 --> 00:11:31,103
and that's gonna play
out in 20 years, right?

334
00:11:31,103 --> 00:11:33,302
And, and has football hit its apex

335
00:11:33,302 --> 00:11:35,253
because of politics and concussions.

336
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:37,451
So, you know, fuck the Big Four might be

337
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:41,368
esports, soccer, uh MMA
you know and basketball

338
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:46,144
and then this conversation goes
into a whole different place

339
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:48,505
cuz the other three you have fresh slates

340
00:11:48,505 --> 00:11:50,218
and it was really only about the NBA.

341
00:11:50,218 --> 00:11:52,739
Which is ironically, weirdly, intriguingly

342
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:54,416
the one that's starting with it.

343
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,249
Right?

344
00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:58,176
- Yeah. Perfect, thank you so much.

345
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,259
- You got it.

346
00:12:01,406 --> 00:12:03,656
- [Linda] Next row, anyone?

347
00:12:04,962 --> 00:12:05,795
- [Girl] Hi!

348
00:12:05,795 --> 00:12:06,628
- Hi!

349
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,103
- Hi Gary!
- Hi!

350
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,686
- Nice to meet you!

351
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:13,823
So most of us in this class

352
00:12:13,823 --> 00:12:17,100
are studying marketing as our degree

353
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,006
so we're doing a lot of
interviews for internships

354
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,535
so do you have any tips for interviewing?

355
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:23,880
- Uh

356
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,393
for the interview itself?

357
00:12:25,393 --> 00:12:26,331
- Yes like through it

358
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:28,129
for a marketing position.

359
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:28,962
- Uh

360
00:12:28,962 --> 00:12:30,628
I would tell you the number
one thing you should do

361
00:12:30,628 --> 00:12:33,211
is be disproportionally honest.

362
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:36,546
I think the biggest mistake
that people make in interviews

363
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:38,264
is they play a part.

364
00:12:38,264 --> 00:12:40,435
None of you and I mean none of you

365
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:43,333
are actually gonna act normal
in any of these interviews.

366
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,838
(group laughs)

367
00:12:44,838 --> 00:12:46,926
Let me tell you why.

368
00:12:46,926 --> 00:12:49,509
I'd rather you not get any jobs

369
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:56,896
than to have to keep up a
facade inside that place.

370
00:12:56,896 --> 00:12:57,797
- That makes sense.

371
00:12:57,797 --> 00:12:59,812
- It's kind of like die
by your sword, right?

372
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:00,995
Like, be you.

373
00:13:00,995 --> 00:13:02,055
Like, be you and be like

374
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:05,528
Look, I'm giving you
advice that I've taken

375
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:08,301
and being front row seat to this.

376
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:10,182
A lot of more people are comfortable

377
00:13:10,182 --> 00:13:11,367
with the things I'm saying today

378
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:13,494
than they were six years ago, right?

379
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:14,768
And a hell of a lot more

380
00:13:14,768 --> 00:13:16,728
are gonna be comfortable in six years.

381
00:13:16,728 --> 00:13:17,561
Right?

382
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:18,764
So when you're in these interviews

383
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,071
and people start asking you questions

384
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:24,511
I don't know, I don't care,
or I think that's ridiculous

385
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:27,438
are answers none of you guys are gonna say

386
00:13:27,438 --> 00:13:29,715
and I think they're the
actual right answers

387
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:32,729
that can start your career
off in an incredible way.

388
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,786
- Okay.

389
00:13:33,786 --> 00:13:36,068
- And by the way, by the way, real quick

390
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:38,879
I don't expect any of
you to take this advice

391
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,430
cuz it's too scary

392
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,132
but I really hope I can
inspire one of you to do it

393
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:46,500
because it's exactly how you
get a job at Vayner Media

394
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,371
which would be a much
better place to get a job

395
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:51,274
than any other agency in this city.

396
00:13:51,274 --> 00:13:52,862
- [Linda] And I agree with it.

397
00:13:52,862 --> 00:13:54,373
I hire for authenticity.

398
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:55,511
I don't want somebody playing a role

399
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:57,828
that somebody's gonna
bring a diverse perspective

400
00:13:57,828 --> 00:13:58,661
to my team.

401
00:13:58,661 --> 00:13:59,562
- And that's exactly why guys.

402
00:13:59,562 --> 00:14:03,846
You may get somebody
who is like (censored)

403
00:14:03,846 --> 00:14:04,984
like why am I doing this?

404
00:14:04,984 --> 00:14:06,666
I get asked by all my clients to do it.

405
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:10,127
It's because she's an outlier
for the right reasons.

406
00:14:10,127 --> 00:14:12,828
And so you can go to (censored)

407
00:14:12,828 --> 00:14:13,661
where she is

408
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:16,184
or you can come to an
entrepreneurial place like I am.

409
00:14:16,184 --> 00:14:17,158
But like

410
00:14:17,158 --> 00:14:19,410
you just wanna die on your sword.

411
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,779
You're gonna give them answers

412
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,538
that you think they want to hear.

413
00:14:23,538 --> 00:14:26,472
So when they bring up something
that you don't believe in

414
00:14:26,472 --> 00:14:28,507
but you learned in this class

415
00:14:28,507 --> 00:14:30,335
you're gonna answer with the class notes

416
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:31,676
and that's a mistake.

417
00:14:31,676 --> 00:14:33,385
You need to go with what you believe.

418
00:14:33,385 --> 00:14:34,727
Now you may not know.

419
00:14:34,727 --> 00:14:38,108
Don't just blindly believe
that Snapchat's awesome

420
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:39,329
but like

421
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:40,802
if you believe something

422
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:43,103
you have to die on that sword.

423
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:44,162
- [Linda] Are you saying

424
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:46,077
I don't believe everything I teach them?

425
00:14:46,077 --> 00:14:47,335
C'mon Gary.

426
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:49,679
- I definitely believe
that to be the case.

427
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:50,656
I also

428
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,123
and what I think is more interesting

429
00:14:52,123 --> 00:14:53,179
is I have all the advantages

430
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:55,203
because of Hot Ones and
Instagram and all the things

431
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:57,516
and they don't believe
everything I'm saying either

432
00:14:57,516 --> 00:14:58,737
and that's the point right.

433
00:14:58,737 --> 00:14:59,633
Let them like

434
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:01,021
they should die on their sword.

435
00:15:01,021 --> 00:15:04,130
Not if I've got a moment
in time where I'm cool

436
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,137
and then blindly parrot what I say.

437
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:10,470
Or, they respect the
system or your history.

438
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,962
Like they just need to
form their own opinions

439
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:15,379
and answer on those opinions.

440
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:19,724
- [Linda] Alright, front row?

441
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:21,433
- [Josie] Hi Gary.
- Hi!

442
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:23,506
- I'm Josie thanks for chatting with us.

443
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,524
I wanted to know

444
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:25,877
you're really great at forecasting

445
00:15:25,877 --> 00:15:29,299
kind of what the next big
thing is in the marketing world

446
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:33,255
and you express augmented
reality to be one of those things

447
00:15:33,255 --> 00:15:34,634
so I was just wondering

448
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,072
if you see any current leaders now

449
00:15:37,072 --> 00:15:40,569
in what we call an augmented reality?

450
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:44,471
- It's a Facebook and Snapchat
world when it comes to A.R.

451
00:15:44,471 --> 00:15:46,870
The only thing I see
that's interesting in A.R.

452
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,554
is the way that they're
playing with filters

453
00:15:49,554 --> 00:15:51,231
and kind of those kind of things.

454
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:54,324
The fact of the matter
is everybody in this room

455
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:57,332
is really gonna like when
an A.R. is really good.

456
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:01,392
Like imagine you can
literally take 35 minutes

457
00:16:01,392 --> 00:16:02,865
cuz software's that good

458
00:16:02,865 --> 00:16:04,948
to post an Instagram post

459
00:16:05,922 --> 00:16:10,155
of you dancing with your
sixth grade boyfriend

460
00:16:10,155 --> 00:16:12,184
because you literally took a photo of him

461
00:16:12,184 --> 00:16:14,217
where you can manipulate it.

462
00:16:14,217 --> 00:16:17,588
Like the level of creativity
that A.R. is going to allow us

463
00:16:17,588 --> 00:16:20,028
is gonna be so remarkable

464
00:16:20,028 --> 00:16:22,829
but the leaders are Facebook and Snapchat

465
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:25,424
because of what they've been buying up.

466
00:16:25,424 --> 00:16:27,415
The startups they've been buying up.

467
00:16:27,415 --> 00:16:28,248
Um

468
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:30,019
and then you gotta look
at Apple and Google

469
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:32,745
because they own the phones, right?

470
00:16:32,745 --> 00:16:36,048
So they make it default
when we take a photo

471
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:38,801
well that's an interesting
arbitrage, right?

472
00:16:38,801 --> 00:16:41,131
So, you don't need an app
it's just part of the phone.

473
00:16:41,131 --> 00:16:42,108
So

474
00:16:42,108 --> 00:16:43,529
I think it's gonna happen in mobile

475
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:46,096
I think long term it's gonna
happen in contact lenses.

476
00:16:46,096 --> 00:16:48,094
I think you especially how young you are

477
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:50,012
will live a life where

478
00:16:50,012 --> 00:16:52,623
your brain will control your contact lens.

479
00:16:52,623 --> 00:16:55,551
In essence your brain
will control your new eye

480
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,627
and you will switch from real life

481
00:16:57,627 --> 00:16:59,468
augmented reality

482
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:01,385
and to virtual reality.

483
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:04,344
A mixed reality world

484
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:05,900
where you can have the choice.

485
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,386
Like how awesome would it be in this class

486
00:17:08,386 --> 00:17:10,317
when (censored) is a little bit boring

487
00:17:10,317 --> 00:17:11,906
for you to switch something

488
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,287
and what you're actually doing

489
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:15,573
is living in a virtual reality world.

490
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:17,907
And so, I think that's cool.

491
00:17:17,907 --> 00:17:20,115
- I hope contacts don't get banned

492
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:21,497
cuz I actually need that stuff.

493
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:23,738
- I don't think they're gonna get banned.

494
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:24,589
I think, I mean.

495
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,422
I think

496
00:17:25,423 --> 00:17:27,926
you wanna talk about radical transparency?

497
00:17:27,926 --> 00:17:31,509
I'm so happy for you and all
the other women in this class

498
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,630
in seven years we're gonna know

499
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,543
that you might be livestreaming right now

500
00:17:35,543 --> 00:17:37,744
through your contact lenses.

501
00:17:37,744 --> 00:17:39,784
(laughs)

502
00:17:39,784 --> 00:17:40,722
I mean it

503
00:17:40,722 --> 00:17:42,073
I have a funny feeling that's gonna have

504
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:45,406
one of the great impacts on our society.

505
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:47,859
- Thank you.

506
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,859
- [Linda] Last question?

507
00:17:52,648 --> 00:17:54,487
- [Man #2] So quick question.

508
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:55,581
In your opinion

509
00:17:55,581 --> 00:17:57,905
what's more valuable

510
00:17:57,905 --> 00:18:00,750
interning with say, a start
up who's just getting going

511
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,891
or someone who, even a startup

512
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:04,011
who's grown more than the other ones.

513
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:06,132
Or actually starting your own start up

514
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:07,275
and starting your own company

515
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:09,308
even if it fails.

516
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:10,824
- Um, 100% predicated

517
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:14,147
on the person's ability to be self aware

518
00:18:14,147 --> 00:18:15,417
and understand who they are.

519
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:18,636
If you're an entrepreneur,
start a company and fail.

520
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:21,053
If you're not, the first one.

521
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:23,967
- Alright. Perfect.

522
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:27,523
- [Man #3] One more Hot Ones question

523
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,233
cuz I can't not ask.

524
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,638
How hot was the last dab?

525
00:18:31,638 --> 00:18:33,230
- Was that the third to last one?

526
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,450
Or the last one?

527
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,464
- Last last one.

528
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:38,569
- Not even remotely close to
hot as the third to last one.

529
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:40,902
- That's what everyone says.

530
00:18:42,283 --> 00:18:44,701
I tried it recently. My brain melted.

531
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:47,065
(class laughs)

532
00:18:47,065 --> 00:18:50,118
- They go by that scoring system right?

533
00:18:50,118 --> 00:18:51,622
- Yeah, scovilles.

534
00:18:51,622 --> 00:18:53,133
- As somebody that grew
up in the wine business

535
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:56,303
where you know a wine could
get 95 points, 92 points

536
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:57,483
I promise you

537
00:18:57,483 --> 00:18:58,419
that

538
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:02,023
they misrated those last three wings.

539
00:19:02,023 --> 00:19:03,778
- Wow, what's the best ones?

540
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:06,265
- Those, I loved seven.

541
00:19:06,265 --> 00:19:08,464
The one right before insanity.

542
00:19:08,464 --> 00:19:11,966
(men exclaiming)

543
00:19:11,966 --> 00:19:15,796
Dude you guys really need to
question how hardcore you are

544
00:19:15,796 --> 00:19:17,747
about hot ones.

545
00:19:17,747 --> 00:19:19,331
I'm just kidding

546
00:19:19,331 --> 00:19:21,363
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

547
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:23,438
- I've wasted so much time.

548
00:19:23,438 --> 00:19:25,554
I analyzed your video for this class, too!

549
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:27,589
- I appreciate it, thank you.

550
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:29,378
- [Linda] Apparently I need to watch this.

551
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:30,558
- Oh it's really good, Linda.

552
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:32,649
You're gonna like it.

553
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:35,628
- [Man #3] It's the smartest
talk show available right now.

554
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:38,334
- [Linda] Alright, one last
question. Back on topic.

555
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:39,167
- Yes.

556
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:40,609
- [Linda] So we've talked
a lot in this class

557
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:42,400
about social influencers--
- Yes.

558
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,669
- Credibility, reach, amplification.

559
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:48,531
And I think Vayner has a
really unique point of view

560
00:19:48,531 --> 00:19:50,124
on how to leverage them.

561
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:51,257
So can you talk a little
bit more about that.

562
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:52,396
- Yep. So class.

563
00:19:52,396 --> 00:19:54,712
I think it's one of

564
00:19:54,712 --> 00:19:56,500
I think it's about inefficiencies.

565
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,051
Facebook is inefficient

566
00:19:58,051 --> 00:20:01,034
because Pepsi, BMW should
be spending more there

567
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,904
which means it's cheaper.

568
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:04,367
Got it? Very simple.

569
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:08,034
Humans are the more
inefficient thing in the world.

570
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:08,928
So.

571
00:20:08,928 --> 00:20:10,637
Influencers are super interesting.

572
00:20:10,637 --> 00:20:12,193
For example

573
00:20:12,193 --> 00:20:15,779
some people think they
should get $5,000 a post

574
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:18,926
because they bought a ton of
fucking fans on Instagram.

575
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,147
Right?

576
00:20:20,147 --> 00:20:21,697
Ludicrous.

577
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:24,824
Meanwhile, on the flip side, an alpha mom

578
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:25,657
right?

579
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,975
A woman in Shore Hills, New Jersey

580
00:20:28,975 --> 00:20:30,275
that is the alpha mom

581
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:34,102
that affects 400 other
woman of high income

582
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:36,298
around products and services

583
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:39,350
may want $100 for a post on Instagram

584
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,684
and it's worth 10 thousand, 50 thousand.

585
00:20:42,684 --> 00:20:43,536
Got it?

586
00:20:43,536 --> 00:20:46,261
So we need to treat it like media.

587
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:47,442
So for example

588
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:50,456
if I was, if I was (censor)

589
00:20:50,456 --> 00:20:52,626
who's becoming culturally irrelevant

590
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:56,269
I would buy 78 thousand
people on Instagram.

591
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:58,682
Not three personalities.

592
00:20:58,682 --> 00:21:02,393
I don't think about influencers
like endorsements, right?

593
00:21:02,393 --> 00:21:04,392
Or spokespeople.

594
00:21:04,392 --> 00:21:08,016
I think about influencers
as in buying media, right?

595
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,316
Scale

596
00:21:09,316 --> 00:21:12,415
and buy 78 thousand people efficiently.

597
00:21:12,415 --> 00:21:13,836
I think it's an incredible opportunity

598
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:15,508
especially for the people in here

599
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:16,446
that are starting startups.

600
00:21:16,446 --> 00:21:20,029
You can hit real pay
dirt with influencers.

601
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:22,967
- [Man #4] So just to clarify.

602
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:26,423
It's more about contextualization
within the field

603
00:21:26,423 --> 00:21:27,926
rather than that cache.

604
00:21:27,926 --> 00:21:30,251
You'd rather have a
person that has a blog--

605
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:32,427
- Both. Nope. No.

606
00:21:32,427 --> 00:21:34,754
- I would love Kim Kardashian

607
00:21:34,754 --> 00:21:36,836
if she's willing to be underpriced

608
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:39,196
and she fits my brand.

609
00:21:39,196 --> 00:21:40,029
Got it?

610
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,893
- Okay.

611
00:21:41,893 --> 00:21:44,160
- So I think there's cache in both.

612
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,623
Again, the number one PTA mom in St. Louis

613
00:21:47,623 --> 00:21:51,252
is the number one fucking
PTA mom to those 700 people.

614
00:21:51,252 --> 00:21:54,999
So, I think the cache is
contextualized, right?

615
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:56,056
Like for example.

616
00:21:56,056 --> 00:21:57,195
You guys

617
00:21:57,195 --> 00:21:59,844
like the thought that a
42 year old business man

618
00:21:59,844 --> 00:22:02,004
would've been cool to people in their 20s

619
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:04,620
five years ago would've
been laughable, right?

620
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,074
But I have figured out how
to contextualize myself

621
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:10,094
to make myself relevant
to you guys, right?

622
00:22:10,094 --> 00:22:12,292
While that wasn't me manipulating it.

623
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:14,525
It was riding the wave of entrepreneurship

624
00:22:14,525 --> 00:22:16,229
being put on a pedestal.

625
00:22:16,229 --> 00:22:17,815
And then, I got lucky

626
00:22:17,815 --> 00:22:19,932
because I grew up in an environment

627
00:22:19,932 --> 00:22:21,559
that was a little bit more urban

628
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:22,785
I was a shitty student.

629
00:22:22,785 --> 00:22:27,513
I had some level of swag
that made it authentic

630
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,219
for me to go on Hot Ones
and be able to talk about

631
00:22:29,219 --> 00:22:32,052
Post Malone or Cardi B or Lil Xan.

632
00:22:33,162 --> 00:22:35,359
You know what I mean?

633
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,196
- [Linda] I think it goes
back to what you said

634
00:22:37,196 --> 00:22:38,335
at the beginning

635
00:22:38,335 --> 00:22:40,864
around getting the right
value for your money, right?

636
00:22:40,864 --> 00:22:41,697
- That's it.

637
00:22:41,697 --> 00:22:43,463
- Some are overvalued,
some are undervalued

638
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:45,422
but depending on your business objectives

639
00:22:45,422 --> 00:22:47,539
what your brand is trying to do

640
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:49,128
and making sure you get the right reach

641
00:22:49,128 --> 00:22:50,512
in the right context.

642
00:22:50,512 --> 00:22:51,487
- To that point, class.

643
00:22:51,487 --> 00:22:53,321
I think the Super Bowl
is the number one deal

644
00:22:53,321 --> 00:22:54,404
in marketing.

645
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:56,859
Right?

646
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:57,692
That's not digital.

647
00:22:57,692 --> 00:23:00,124
That's a tv commercial that I
like to shit on all the time

648
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:01,103
but I think it's the best deal

649
00:23:01,103 --> 00:23:03,309
because everybody sees it.

650
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:05,590
Whether you see it on
YouTube or you watch it.

651
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,423
All of you

652
00:23:06,423 --> 00:23:07,949
at your young youth

653
00:23:07,949 --> 00:23:09,864
will watch the Super Bowl ads.

654
00:23:09,864 --> 00:23:11,593
Forget about you being in marketing class

655
00:23:11,593 --> 00:23:12,949
four years ago, six years ago

656
00:23:12,949 --> 00:23:14,348
when you were in high school

657
00:23:14,348 --> 00:23:16,643
you still saw the Super Bowl ads.

658
00:23:16,643 --> 00:23:19,746
That's incredible penetration awareness.

659
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:21,498
- [Girl #2] Can I ask you
a question about that then?

660
00:23:21,498 --> 00:23:22,331
- Yeah.

661
00:23:22,331 --> 00:23:26,013
- Has been telling us she is
not going to be running the ad

662
00:23:26,013 --> 00:23:28,021
and since you guys run her company

663
00:23:28,021 --> 00:23:29,903
what do you think about that then?

664
00:23:29,903 --> 00:23:32,644
- I think that they should
run Super Bowl, right?

665
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,472
But we don't plan their media

666
00:23:34,472 --> 00:23:35,858
we do their creative

667
00:23:35,858 --> 00:23:38,509
so that is against my strategy.

668
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:40,380
Now, just so you guys know

669
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,457
for all the coolness
that's going in my life

670
00:23:42,457 --> 00:23:44,412
I don't think I'm right about everything

671
00:23:44,412 --> 00:23:46,206
but I really, really, really do believe

672
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:49,461
I'm very passionate about
our strategy on Super Bowl.

673
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,461
- Thank you.

674
00:23:51,742 --> 00:23:54,143
- [Linda] Thank you so
much for your time today.

675
00:23:54,143 --> 00:23:55,526
We really appreciate it.

676
00:23:55,526 --> 00:23:56,950
- Thanks, Linda. I love you.

677
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:57,804
Take care.

678
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:58,637
Bye class.

679
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,576
