1
00:00:00,877 --> 00:00:02,913
- This is Yudkin

2
00:00:02,913 --> 00:00:04,369
(bell dinging)

3
00:00:04,369 --> 00:00:06,733
and this is probably
the most in-depth piece

4
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:08,338
of content you'll see from me this year.

5
00:00:08,338 --> 00:00:10,720
In Colorado, shit got
deep with me and D-Rock,

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,721
hope you enjoy.

7
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:14,304
(lively music)

8
00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:19,449
I think the world like, lacks optimism.

9
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:22,457
I think, you know, everyone's like,

10
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:23,791
"Your energy! Your energy!"

11
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,581
I've come to realize, it's just optimism.

12
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:27,748
Just happy, just positive.

13
00:00:28,793 --> 00:00:30,293
That's what it is.

14
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,173
Like, whatever chemicals
are in my body, they just

15
00:00:34,173 --> 00:00:37,306
allow me to see the bright
side, like and I just,

16
00:00:37,306 --> 00:00:40,301
don't think I've realized
how few people have that.

17
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:44,779
Like, very few people have
it as black and white, 100-0.

18
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:46,128
I just think everything's good,

19
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:49,965
but like you know, I'm dying to know,

20
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:52,137
out of eight billion people,
like, what the breakdown is.

21
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:55,052
Like, my gut is like six
billion just go directly

22
00:00:55,052 --> 00:00:57,883
into having more pessimism
and cynicism and negativity,

23
00:00:57,883 --> 00:01:02,050
like 51-49 minimumly, all the
way down to very scary places.

24
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:07,011
I just don't think there's
a lot of 80% optimism

25
00:01:07,011 --> 00:01:09,261
- [Man] Is that the way
they were raised, or?

26
00:01:09,261 --> 00:01:12,235
- Just environment,
raised, all that stuff.

27
00:01:12,235 --> 00:01:13,446
Anyway.

28
00:01:13,446 --> 00:01:14,491
(sighs)

29
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,874
What's up Jesse Gomez, good
to see you, Coach John Castro,

30
00:01:16,874 --> 00:01:18,291
great to see you.

31
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:22,372
Much love to all of you guys.

32
00:01:22,372 --> 00:01:25,513
And, appreciate you so much.

33
00:01:25,513 --> 00:01:27,977
"I force myself to become
optimistic every day, it does not

34
00:01:27,977 --> 00:01:29,743
"come naturally," I get it Susan.

35
00:01:29,743 --> 00:01:31,414
It doesn't come naturally
to a lot of people, I think

36
00:01:31,414 --> 00:01:34,090
it's like, you know, if I
was able to say I'm lucky

37
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,342
about something, forget
about the business results,

38
00:01:36,342 --> 00:01:39,581
it's lucky that, that optimism
comes naturally to me.

39
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:41,412
Like, I'm just optimistic,
like I just think that

40
00:01:41,412 --> 00:01:45,412
so much works for me,
because I refuse to accept

41
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:47,299
the negative.

42
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,504
Like, you know, and I don't think...

43
00:01:49,504 --> 00:01:51,183
I hate when people say it's, you know,

44
00:01:51,183 --> 00:01:53,939
it's an option, or it's a choice.

45
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,331
I agree with you, Susan, I
don't think it comes naturally

46
00:01:56,331 --> 00:01:58,081
to everybody, I think we're just starting

47
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:01,242
on the early stages of really
looking at mental health,

48
00:02:01,242 --> 00:02:05,556
the brain, meditation,
and I do think, like,

49
00:02:05,556 --> 00:02:08,015
that's like saying, be beautiful!

50
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:10,267
It doesn't come natural
to everybody, some of us,

51
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:11,260
you know, yes.

52
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,387
I'm just kidding.

53
00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:16,554
But like, you know, like, I
, know you, I do think that

54
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:21,848
some things are etched with us early on,

55
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:24,768
and I'm so grateful, I sit
here in front of the 2000

56
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:27,649
of you, which in itself is
ridiculous, like I can turn

57
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:30,322
something on, and in three
minutes I have 2000 people,

58
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:32,826
care enough to hear what I have to say.

59
00:02:32,826 --> 00:02:36,993
I sit here with, ego, and
humility, gratitude, and focus.

60
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:42,183
Appreciation, and a
sense of responsibility,

61
00:02:42,183 --> 00:02:46,401
all built around, really
this optimistic foundation,

62
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:49,792
that is the fuel that
drives me to my hustle,

63
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:52,474
and to my execution in the
marketplace, and I thank you

64
00:02:52,474 --> 00:02:55,567
for your, I thank you for your

65
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:59,734
for your attention and support,
and I recognize, you know

66
00:03:01,337 --> 00:03:05,793
it's funny, like, I wish
people understood what I do

67
00:03:05,793 --> 00:03:10,305
with my attention, you know,
somebody would just announce

68
00:03:10,305 --> 00:03:13,888
VaynerSports, and somebody
wrote a cynical article here,

69
00:03:13,888 --> 00:03:15,990
saying, "After watching the
announcement of VaynerSports,

70
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,613
"it's obvious to me that
Gary Vaynerchuk loves

71
00:03:17,613 --> 00:03:19,161
"to hear himself speak."

72
00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:23,489
Which is true, but what I'd
like to say to that journalist,

73
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:26,954
unnamed, you know, who writes
headlines to make pennies

74
00:03:26,954 --> 00:03:31,297
in banner-ad advertising,
is, "My intent is a fuckload

75
00:03:31,297 --> 00:03:32,962
"better than yours, partner."

76
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,341
What I want to do with
my attention is allow

77
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:38,591
the 2000 of you to 10s of 1000s of you,

78
00:03:39,872 --> 00:03:44,039
to take it, I want to hand
you my optimism, my happiness,

79
00:03:45,746 --> 00:03:49,770
my view of the world, my
opportunities that I see

80
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,659
in the white space, and
I want to give it to you,

81
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,157
for free, and then I want you to win.

82
00:03:54,157 --> 00:03:57,544
And what I ask for in return
is the hope that I get

83
00:03:57,544 --> 00:04:00,045
an email or the attention
for you to say thank you.

84
00:04:00,045 --> 00:04:04,212
I have no interest in
monetizing anybody, and I think

85
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,992
people are basic.

86
00:04:06,992 --> 00:04:09,325
They haven't figured me out.

87
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,617
They have just not figured it out.

88
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:15,034
I get off on people being grateful to me,

89
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,073
the way I'm grateful to
my mother, and father.

90
00:04:21,632 --> 00:04:25,799
So, what you do with your
attention is very important,

91
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,939
and I implore all of you to
think about people that you're

92
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:35,437
spending time, and allowing
to have your attention,

93
00:04:35,437 --> 00:04:37,273
what is their intent?

94
00:04:37,273 --> 00:04:39,412
Have you been able to reverse engineer

95
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,572
what they want to happen?

96
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,688
Are they looking to
bring you into a funnel?

97
00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:45,475
Into a master class?

98
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:47,552
Into an ebook, into a course?

99
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:51,815
Are they looking for you
to invest in their company?

100
00:04:51,815 --> 00:04:54,408
Are they looking for you,
like what do they want?

101
00:04:54,408 --> 00:04:55,786
What do they want?

102
00:04:55,786 --> 00:04:59,158
Or, like many people, I'm
not on an island by myself,

103
00:04:59,158 --> 00:05:02,141
are they just grateful
to get their craft out

104
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:05,442
into the world, and see
it live, and in scale.

105
00:05:05,442 --> 00:05:08,026
Have you found the people
in your life that have

106
00:05:08,026 --> 00:05:09,735
already won and are good?

107
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:12,771
'Cause that's what I am,
that's why I'm so attracted

108
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,359
to my mom, she's good.

109
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,868
She doesn't need anything.

110
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:18,514
I'm good, I don't need
anything from you guys.

111
00:05:18,514 --> 00:05:20,461
I just don't need anything from you guys.

112
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:21,879
I don't want anything.

113
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,257
I want you to listen, and
then go have happiness

114
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:26,668
and success.

115
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:29,070
Whether that's work/life
balance, whether that's

116
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,712
honing your skiing skills,
whether that building

117
00:05:31,712 --> 00:05:33,872
a million dollar business, I don't care.

118
00:05:33,872 --> 00:05:35,368
I don't need you to be a hustler.

119
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,076
I don't need you to be an entrepreneur.

120
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:38,667
I don't need you to be a businessman.

121
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:40,334
I don't need you to do anything.

122
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:44,501
I need you to pay me back by
going out and doing something

123
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:50,515
with what I'm giving you,
paying back the attention

124
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:54,187
I'm taking, from you,
paying yourself back,

125
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,603
you know, giving me the
feeling that I'm bringing value

126
00:05:57,603 --> 00:06:01,164
to the world, by actually doing something

127
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:03,118
about what I have to say.

128
00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:07,459
That's what I'm doing with my
attention, what are you doing

129
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:08,882
with your attention?

130
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:12,712
Anyway, back to you guys, got
into a little rant mode there,

131
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:16,629
"Off to work, great job,"
Frances, I love that.

132
00:06:17,474 --> 00:06:19,408
"That's Buddhist belief,
treat others as you would

133
00:06:19,408 --> 00:06:21,117
"like to treat your mother."

134
00:06:21,117 --> 00:06:25,284
I believe in that stuff,
whatever religion or genre,

135
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:31,620
or practice or thesis believes
in doing the right thing,

136
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:36,776
and doing right by others, and
then the universe takes over

137
00:06:36,776 --> 00:06:40,030
and brings you value, I
actually think its not some,

138
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,276
karma cosmic thing, I think
it's actually quite practical.

139
00:06:43,276 --> 00:06:47,101
Would it not make sense
to our practical brains,

140
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:49,125
that if you're doing something
good for somebody else,

141
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,883
that that puts you in a leverage position

142
00:06:51,883 --> 00:06:53,431
for something good to happen to you.

143
00:06:53,431 --> 00:06:56,096
I'm actually not very
romantic or cosmic, or spacey,

144
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:59,357
or zenified around providing people value.

145
00:06:59,357 --> 00:07:01,429
Like, I love karma, I believe
in it, 'cause I believe

146
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:03,596
karma's fucking practical.

147
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:05,740
How about that?

148
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,450
Because I believe karma's practical.

149
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,741
I believe that if you do
something good for somebody else,

150
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:12,321
if you provide them value,
if you're taking their time

151
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:14,144
and providing them with good
thoughts, and good themes,

152
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:16,008
and good strategies, and good outlooks,

153
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:17,472
and seeing white space.

154
00:07:17,472 --> 00:07:20,140
I believe that the people
that started SnapChat,

155
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,971
design agencies building filters,

156
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:24,304
oh, I broke out.

157
00:07:25,182 --> 00:07:27,440
I believe that the people that went out

158
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,203
and built SnapChat design
filter agencies that have been

159
00:07:31,203 --> 00:07:33,083
making money over the last
month, because they listened

160
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:37,075
to me, yeah, I believe that
they'll say good things

161
00:07:37,075 --> 00:07:39,498
about me, that will make
more people pay attention.

162
00:07:39,498 --> 00:07:41,823
I believe that they'll tell
clients to work with me.

163
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,583
I believe that they'll tell
their sister that's talented

164
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,882
or their brother that's
talented to go work for Vaynor,

165
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:49,056
or intern there.

166
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:53,905
Yes I do believe that doing
the right thing is practical.

167
00:07:53,905 --> 00:07:54,738
I love it.

168
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:56,601
"How do you deal with
low energy or sickness?"

169
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,100
Dave, when you're sick, you
gotta get rest, and you gotta

170
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,086
get better, you write.

171
00:08:00,086 --> 00:08:01,428
But low energy doesn't come natural to me.

172
00:08:01,428 --> 00:08:04,608
I've realized what's
going on here, one life.

173
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:08,357
I've realized that I'm
living like, this is our only

174
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:10,552
at-bat, and most of you aren't.

175
00:08:10,552 --> 00:08:11,971
People are fucking walking around here,

176
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:13,225
like they're coming back.

177
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,464
People fucking walking around
here like they're coming back!

178
00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:16,513
(laughs)

179
00:08:16,513 --> 00:08:17,596
You're not coming back.

180
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:19,637
Well, listen, I don't want to
impose my beliefs on others,

181
00:08:19,637 --> 00:08:21,219
maybe you believe you're coming back.

182
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:22,510
I believe if you're coming
back, you're coming back

183
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,579
as a tree, or as a flower
pot, or D-Rock's sneakers.

184
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:27,877
And that blows compared to being a human,

185
00:08:27,877 --> 00:08:29,378
and so I'm acting that way.

186
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:31,293
I'm acting that way.

187
00:08:31,293 --> 00:00:00,000
(thoughtful music)
