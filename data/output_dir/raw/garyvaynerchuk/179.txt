1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,396
- So, what you're about to see

2
00:00:01,396 --> 00:00:03,127
is a really interesting interaction.

3
00:00:03,127 --> 00:00:06,736
A lovely lady that I kind
of spoke on the stage

4
00:00:06,736 --> 00:00:09,268
after my talk, and then,
came up and got a book.

5
00:00:09,268 --> 00:00:12,267
Then, she came back and kudos to her

6
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:15,427
to ask some questions about her business.

7
00:00:15,427 --> 00:00:17,660
As you guys know, normally
I'm giving one or two

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,867
quick answers 'cause I don't
have time unfortunately,

9
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:24,083
in settings like this, but
something caught my attention,

10
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,601
and I dig into the details

11
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:29,120
and get into some of the
kind of questions I would ask

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,474
if I were with you and
kind of the questions

13
00:00:31,474 --> 00:00:33,907
that I would hope that
you're asking yourself

14
00:00:33,907 --> 00:00:37,103
as you're trying to figure out
why something's not working.

15
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:39,915
- I'm going to tell you my
story, if I can take over?

16
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,764
I'm running a food truck.

17
00:00:41,764 --> 00:00:43,235
I'm not the market here.

18
00:00:43,235 --> 00:00:44,930
I'm startup.

19
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,054
The reason why I'm here is you.

20
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:49,743
I'd never know what this market is for.

21
00:00:49,743 --> 00:00:51,292
I learned a lot today.

22
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:55,384
My story is I had one truck one
year ago, American barbecue.

23
00:00:55,384 --> 00:00:57,101
Nobody knows about the barbecue.

24
00:00:57,101 --> 00:00:57,934
- Here?

25
00:00:57,934 --> 00:00:59,869
- I'm talking about 100 kilometers out.

26
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:02,620
It runs really good, really good.

27
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,615
And then, think big, take the market.

28
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:08,021
I bought another one and another one.

29
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:09,264
Then ...

30
00:01:09,264 --> 00:01:10,692
- Got stretched.

31
00:01:10,692 --> 00:01:11,577
- My revenue ...

32
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:12,410
- You moved too fast.

33
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,886
- I moved too fast.

34
00:01:13,886 --> 00:01:16,263
Now, I'm at the bottom

35
00:01:16,263 --> 00:01:18,930
and I don't know what was wrong.

36
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:22,276
- You're not sure why it happened?

37
00:01:22,276 --> 00:01:23,504
- No, actually not.

38
00:01:23,504 --> 00:01:24,751
Is it the market?

39
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,403
Was my message not clear enough?

40
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:28,294
My product is good.

41
00:01:28,294 --> 00:01:29,225
- So let me help you.

42
00:01:29,225 --> 00:01:30,093
- My product is good.

43
00:01:30,093 --> 00:01:31,077
- Let me help you a little bit.

44
00:01:31,077 --> 00:01:31,910
Let me help you.

45
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:32,743
- Please.

46
00:01:32,743 --> 00:01:34,719
- The first thing I would do to ...

47
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,395
First of all, I love you for being honest.

48
00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:37,700
To say, "I don't know what went wrong,"

49
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,509
is very important, very powerful.

50
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,369
If you go backwards, the
first thing I would do,

51
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,385
like if I was buying 50% of your company.

52
00:01:45,385 --> 00:01:46,390
Now, we're partners.

53
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,239
I would say, okay, first
meeting, 9 a.m., 7 a.m.,

54
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,527
you know, first meeting,
"Tell me everything."

55
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:56,528
Tell me what you did, everything you did

56
00:01:56,528 --> 00:01:59,584
when you were running one truck.

57
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:03,368
Then, tell me what you did,
you, you when you had three.

58
00:02:03,368 --> 00:02:06,093
My belief is that when you had one

59
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,506
all the energy was going in one places

60
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:12,673
which means you were going
further down the line, deeper

61
00:02:13,806 --> 00:02:17,975
and somewhere in there was
the most important thing

62
00:02:17,975 --> 00:02:20,343
that you had to not be able to do

63
00:02:20,343 --> 00:02:23,343
when you became the manager of three.

64
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,673
That's it.

65
00:02:24,673 --> 00:02:25,677
That's it.

66
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:28,306
I'm telling you, what's
very exciting for me to be--

67
00:02:28,306 --> 00:02:30,080
- So what is now the advice?

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,424
To go back to one?

69
00:02:31,424 --> 00:02:32,552
- Probably, probably.

70
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:33,622
- To focus or to go to diversity?

71
00:02:33,622 --> 00:02:34,455
- Or.

72
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:35,920
- Say, "Okay, I'm selling Italian pizza?"

73
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,395
- No, no, no, definitely not that.

74
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:38,575
Definitely not that.

75
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,686
- Italian pizza is good.

76
00:02:39,686 --> 00:02:40,893
- Respect, respect.

77
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:42,251
- Yeah, but I'm a barbecue person.

78
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:43,463
- Definitely, definitely not diversity.

79
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,451
Definitely not.

80
00:02:44,451 --> 00:02:45,284
- Okay.

81
00:02:45,284 --> 00:02:47,750
- If it worked at one,
it would work at 100.

82
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,798
You stopped doing something

83
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:53,715
at three that you used to do at one

84
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:57,612
that became the vulnerability.

85
00:02:57,612 --> 00:03:00,664
So did you used to be
the front of the truck?

86
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:02,211
- Yeah, a lot more of course.

87
00:03:02,211 --> 00:03:03,044
- Great.

88
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:03,877
Now, you're not.

89
00:03:03,877 --> 00:03:04,814
You can't be in three trucks.

90
00:03:04,814 --> 00:03:05,647
- No.

91
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:07,624
- So the next question
becomes are the two people

92
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:10,163
that are the front of the
truck not the kind of people

93
00:03:10,163 --> 00:03:12,332
that people want to buy barbecue from?

94
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:13,246
Maybe, maybe not.

95
00:03:13,246 --> 00:03:14,079
I don't know.

96
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:15,739
- It might be one of the problem.

97
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:18,746
- Next, you can take a step back.

98
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:20,639
I believe you the quality of the food,

99
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,895
but everything I would ask:
was the food consistent?

100
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:25,503
Did you have the same exact ingredients?

101
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:26,889
Do you have like all that?

102
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:28,597
Probably yes 'cause that's not that hard.

103
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:29,430
- Yeah, sure.

104
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,263
- But maybe not.

105
00:03:30,263 --> 00:03:31,146
Maybe you had a little less this.

106
00:03:31,146 --> 00:03:32,665
Maybe you had a spread.

107
00:03:32,665 --> 00:03:33,727
I don't know what your allocation.

108
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:36,622
- We did some adjustments to the recipes

109
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:39,682
and to the portions and
so on, but it's normal.

110
00:03:39,682 --> 00:03:42,233
We were stocked up, we did
mistakes, we corrected.

111
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,190
- I get it, but--

112
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,681
- But the market punished
me with no revenue

113
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:47,569
and now I'm there and I don't know.

114
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:48,402
Do I sell?

115
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:49,693
Do I keep going?

116
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:52,404
I am working, working, working
and it's not going better.

117
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:53,495
- Understood.

118
00:03:53,495 --> 00:03:55,099
So, let's go back.

119
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:58,204
The number one truck, did
it stay in a certain area?

120
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,037
- Yeah.

121
00:03:59,037 --> 00:04:00,205
- Does it still stay in that certain area?

122
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:01,038
- Yes.

123
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:03,095
- Is it still doing the
same revenue or down?

124
00:04:03,095 --> 00:04:05,362
- The one truck is doing good revenue.

125
00:04:05,362 --> 00:04:09,252
The other two, they are
not meeting expectation.

126
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:10,090
- Understood.

127
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,422
Your overhead is greater
than what you're getting?

128
00:04:12,422 --> 00:04:14,764
- My assumption was one
truck is doing revenue X,

129
00:04:14,764 --> 00:04:16,023
three trucks is going to do--

130
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:16,856
- Three X.

131
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:17,689
- Three Xs.

132
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:18,522
That was wrong.

133
00:04:18,522 --> 00:04:19,355
- Let me ask you a question.

134
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:20,855
- Why is it wrong?

135
00:04:58,484 --> 00:05:00,033
- I got an idea.

136
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,283
Can you type in the address

137
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,519
where you park the cars?

138
00:05:07,815 --> 00:05:08,648
- Yeah.

139
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:11,060
- Go ahead, type it in.

140
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,050
Yeah, I mean, it goes so detailed.

141
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,251
That's how you win.

142
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:16,661
It's in the trenches.

143
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:17,965
- Yeah, that's the right one.

144
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:19,174
- Okay, I'm gonna show you something.

145
00:05:19,174 --> 00:05:20,007
- Yeah?

146
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:24,087
- Everyday what time do
the trucks start operating?

147
00:05:24,087 --> 00:05:25,897
- 11:30 to two o'clock

148
00:05:25,897 --> 00:05:27,885
and then on the weekend
you know when we are out.

149
00:05:27,885 --> 00:05:28,718
- Good.

150
00:05:28,718 --> 00:05:31,428
I'm gonna show you something
that I want you to do.

151
00:05:31,428 --> 00:05:34,261
I want you to click this everyday.

152
00:05:35,196 --> 00:05:36,029
Everyday.

153
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:36,986
You have Instagram, right?

154
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:37,979
- Mmm hmm.

155
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,287
- Okay, so this is that
town that you're in, right?

156
00:05:40,287 --> 00:05:41,267
- [Lady] Right here.

157
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:45,100
- I want you to click
the photo of the person.

158
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:49,226
So you'll get the person, right?

159
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:53,125
I want you to send a message.

160
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,319
Do you know how to do that?

161
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,389
- [Lady] Of course.

162
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:56,222
- [Gary] You sure?

163
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,114
I want to make sure you get this.

164
00:05:57,114 --> 00:05:59,165
When you go on somebody's
profile, the button's up here.

165
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:00,210
- [Lady] Okay, send message.

166
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,185
- [Gary] And then send message.

167
00:06:01,185 --> 00:06:02,092
- [Lady] Okay.

168
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:02,925
(clicking)

169
00:06:02,925 --> 00:06:04,518
- [Gary] Saw your profile.

170
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:08,518
Come by my truck today
from 11:00 to two o'clock

171
00:06:10,231 --> 00:06:12,166
and I'll give you a free barbecue.

172
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,715
I want you to do that ten times

173
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:15,931
to 20 times every single day.

174
00:06:15,931 --> 00:06:16,764
- [Lady] Okay.

175
00:06:16,764 --> 00:06:18,864
- It's my belief that ...

176
00:06:18,864 --> 00:06:20,858
Now, pay attention to what I showed you.

177
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:22,188
I'm gonna go a little slower.

178
00:06:22,188 --> 00:06:24,932
When you go to a town and
when you get to your phone

179
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:26,496
maybe you can even say the street

180
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:28,153
so it could be even closer.

181
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:31,988
When you go there, what
it shows you on Instagram

182
00:06:31,988 --> 00:06:35,587
is the nine posts that
are the most popular

183
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:38,843
and then in order the people
that did it the most recent.

184
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:41,251
- [Lady] I don't see your influencer.

185
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:43,130
- See, she did this 13 minutes ago.

186
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,871
So either it's people that
are right there right now

187
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:51,727
or it's people with bigger
influence who are there.

188
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:55,469
I could tag myself
here, but then I'm gone.

189
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:58,570
But if you look, she has 3000 followers.

190
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,318
Maybe she lives there.

191
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:03,420
If you message her and say, "I
like your Instagram profile.

192
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,574
"I like Instagram.

193
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:05,440
"My food truck is here.

194
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,415
"Come by and I'll give
you free lunch today."

195
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:12,490
I believe one in every
10 will come everyday

196
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,862
and I believe that.

197
00:07:13,862 --> 00:07:16,677
- 10% catching rate is
a real dream for me.

198
00:07:16,677 --> 00:07:17,768
- But you're giving it for free.

199
00:07:17,768 --> 00:07:18,760
Hear me out.

200
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,945
One in every 10 will come and
then one in every 10 of those,

201
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:25,240
'cause you're not gonna ask,

202
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,009
is gonna post and say, "Delicious."

203
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:30,128
I believe that that is worth 30 minutes

204
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:31,589
of your time everyday.

205
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:33,259
Here's why.

206
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:35,105
My numbers could be totally wrong.

207
00:07:35,105 --> 00:07:37,385
Four out of every 10 could come

208
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:40,108
and three out of every
10 of those could post,

209
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:41,988
but here's what's more important.

210
00:07:41,988 --> 00:07:42,821
One post.

211
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:47,409
You get the right girlfriend
of a soccer player,

212
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:49,788
you get the right influencer,

213
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:53,324
one post can change
your business overnight.

214
00:07:53,324 --> 00:07:54,706
- Thank you.

215
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:57,499
- That's one little tactic
that I want you to do.

216
00:07:57,499 --> 00:07:58,931
It will work.

217
00:07:58,931 --> 00:08:02,114
- Okay, but I'll keep my three trucks.

218
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,520
I'm not going back to one.

219
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,019
- So I know I'm going macro.

220
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:07,936
On the micro, you know, for me, me.

221
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:13,818
If you sold one of your
trucks and went to two,

222
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:18,768
I would look at the math of
what that would look like.

223
00:08:18,768 --> 00:08:21,367
Intuitively, I'm not ready to make a call.

224
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,545
I'd have to look at your
business more carefully.

225
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,962
Intuitively, two feels right.

226
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:32,015
- Yeah, but then I have
to go back to the base.

227
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:34,035
Then, I have to do all the work

228
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:37,361
because I don't have enough
money to pay somebody to do.

229
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:39,066
- And three does that for you?

230
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:41,889
- Yeah, would be if they
would get the revenue.

231
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:42,722
- But they don't.

232
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:43,554
- They don't.

233
00:08:43,554 --> 00:08:45,893
- So how close are you to the revenue?

234
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,970
- I don't know, 30%.

235
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,725
- To 30 of the 100%?

236
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:50,558
- Yes.

237
00:08:54,494 --> 00:08:56,263
- What are you doing to market?

238
00:08:56,263 --> 00:08:57,798
Anything?

239
00:08:57,798 --> 00:09:01,354
- I have Facebook, we have 5000 plus

240
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:03,430
or almost 6000 followers.

241
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,780
- What about Instagram?

242
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,613
- No.

243
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:06,446
- Instagram.

244
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:07,710
- Instagram is the key?

245
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,684
- You have to understand why.

246
00:09:08,684 --> 00:09:11,084
Facebook, when you post something

247
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:15,234
1% of the audience sees it organically.

248
00:09:15,234 --> 00:09:17,968
Instagram is 40% organic.

249
00:09:17,968 --> 00:09:19,540
- But Instagram is taking pictures,

250
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,093
taking photos and posting.

251
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:21,926
- Or video.

252
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:23,492
- I have to go out and take pictures.

253
00:09:23,492 --> 00:09:25,323
I have to go out and do the photos.

254
00:09:25,323 --> 00:09:26,202
- No you don't.

255
00:09:26,202 --> 00:09:27,919
- Or do I have to pay
somebody to do it for me?

256
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,752
- Nope.

257
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:31,787
You're sitting in the truck
and you take a picture

258
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:33,402
or take a picture of the meal

259
00:09:33,402 --> 00:09:34,888
or take a picture of the line

260
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:36,548
or take a picture of one person

261
00:09:36,548 --> 00:09:37,895
or take a picture of the flowers

262
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:40,555
that are across the
street from your truck.

263
00:09:40,555 --> 00:09:42,444
Build a micro-local presence

264
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:44,337
'cause you have a micro-local business.

265
00:09:44,337 --> 00:09:45,616
- Yeah.

266
00:09:45,616 --> 00:09:47,700
- Interview people maybe.

267
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,273
This might not come natural to you,

268
00:09:49,273 --> 00:09:51,986
but maybe at first, slow.

269
00:09:51,986 --> 00:09:53,336
- Am I too old for this?

270
00:09:53,336 --> 00:09:54,169
(laughs)

271
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:55,002
- 100% not.

272
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:55,835
- I don't know.

273
00:09:55,835 --> 00:09:56,668
- 100% not.

274
00:09:56,668 --> 00:09:58,506
- A lot of people are saying
to me, "Oh, you are annoying me

275
00:09:58,506 --> 00:10:00,728
"with lot of posts on
Facebook and so on and so on."

276
00:10:00,728 --> 00:10:01,730
- Instagram.

277
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,183
- Okay, Instagram and then influencers.

278
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,545
I'll let you know.

279
00:10:06,545 --> 00:10:07,378
- Let me know.

280
00:10:07,378 --> 00:10:08,251
(laughs)

281
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:09,309
- I'll let you know.
- Good luck.

282
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,660
- Thank you very much.
- So good to see you.

283
00:10:10,660 --> 00:00:00,000
(light music)
