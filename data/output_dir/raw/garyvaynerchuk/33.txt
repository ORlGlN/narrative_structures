86

wrap their self-esteem up

87
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,470
in their business.

88
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,090
You start a new business, you're 24,

89
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,868
you're telling your mom,
you're telling your homies,

90

you're like I got this business

91
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,800
and you're fucking flashing it,

92
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,587
and you put entrepreneur in
the title of your Instagram,

93
00:03:34,587 --> 00:03:37,270

94
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,401

self-esteem goes with it.

everybody, 99% are gonna fail.

99
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,571
Cool, but like 99% are gonna fail,

100
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:51,996

102

103
00:03:57,962 --> 00:04:00,073

137
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,210
because we think a lot
about money and opportunity,

let me tell you about an opportunity

139
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,841
that I can't get out of my head.

140
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:27,221
Which is, there's a
website called Craigslist,

141
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:29,428
there's a section called Free,

142
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:32,169
where people list shit that
they want to get rid of.

143
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:34,300
You go there and you take it,

144
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,790
and then you list it on
Facebook Marketplace,

145
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,762
and you sell it.

146
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:41,230
And when I think about this, I can't...

147
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,300
I've been dreaming about
this for the last 72 hours,

148
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,133
by the way,

149
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:47,089
I'm literally doing this

150
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:48,890
'cause this videos going out.

151
00:05:49,913 --> 00:05:51,841
You know, it's crazy to me

152
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:55,940
that the only thing that
stops somebody from winning,

153
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,589
is education and the work ethic, right?

154
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:00,080
I understand that.

155
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,064
But education comes in
so many different forms.

156
00:06:02,064 --> 00:06:06,060
This is a classroom of 16 year olds,

157
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,730
and they have to make
money in the next 24 months

158
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,050
or bad, bad stuff happens.

159
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,598
I only default into go
buy shit and sell it,

160
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:15,444
and run the internet arbitrage,

161
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:17,730
we'll spend the first three months,

162
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,860
I'll teach you everything
about Craigslist and eBay,

163
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,392
and Facebook Marketplace, and LetGo,

164
00:06:21,392 --> 00:06:24,411
and then we'll talk about
China and buying shit there,

165
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:25,680
and the arbitrage,

166
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,960
I would spend an enormous amount of time

167
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,780
because the practicality right now

168
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,540
in the inefficiency of the internet

169
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,355
of buying and selling
stuff is extraordinary.

170
00:06:34,355 --> 00:06:37,125
In the last three weeks,
I've had these kids

171
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,736
who have been following my content

172
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:40,960
and they're like, "Gary,
I wanna get your advice,"

173
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,310
and basically, both narratives
went the exact same way

174
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,138
which is, hey, I listened to you,

175
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,315
I got good, I started buying stuff,

176
00:06:47,315 --> 00:06:48,320
then I hit it big.

177
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,850
A bunch of people made a lot of money

178
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,535
on the solar eclipse glasses,

179
00:06:51,535 --> 00:06:53,640
like you could literally buy those things

180
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,229
for like 16 cents in China on Baidu

181
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:58,210
and then sell it for
like $4 a pop on Amazon.

182
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,043
People made bank.

183
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,956
Like I know one kid who made $317,000.

184
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:02,019
(crowd murmuring)

185
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:04,590
On a $3,000 starting point, right?

186
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,470
So, it's very real to me,

187
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,610
instead of "I'm gonna build some crazy app

188
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,800
"that's gonna fucking
change the world," right?

189
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,567
'Cause it's practical as fuck.

190
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,990
And both of them have made real money,

191
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,010
one kids made like $60,000 this year,

192
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,759
off of like a hundred dollar base.

193
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,168
Like real money, and
both of them took it all

194
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:25,457
and bought crypto.

195
00:07:25,457 --> 00:07:27,530
- [Audience Member] Woo!

196
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,134
- [Gary] Yes, yes.

197
00:07:29,134 --> 00:07:31,610
(laughter)

198
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,056
And by the way, I believe in
blockchain as a technology

199
00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:35,716
out my ass.

200
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:38,060
The part of the story he doesn't know

201
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,287
is they bought at $17,000, right?

202
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,120
(crowd groans)

203
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,120
And they bought at $17,000
because they read 400 articles

204
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:48,569
that said it was gonna be $34,000

205
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:52,240
and by the way, Bitcoin could be $400,000.

206
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,794
I'm not sure, I don't know.

207
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:55,728
Here's what I'm disappointed in:

208
00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:57,185
Short-term thinking.

209
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,390
When he goes, "Woo," I'm not mad at him.

210
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,560
I'm like, listen, maybe, long-term.

211
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,601
I don't know anybody's money situation.

212
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:06,613
Let me give you something
that will really work for you.

213
00:08:06,613 --> 00:08:09,610
If you don't have to take
it out of Wall Street,

214
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,285
put your money into Facebook and Amazon,

215
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:13,213
and I promise you, unless America melts

216
00:08:13,213 --> 00:08:16,464
over the next seven to
10 years, you'll do well.

217
00:08:16,464 --> 00:08:17,630
There's certain things

218
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,938
that are just so black
and white obvious, right?

219
00:08:20,938 --> 00:08:23,701
And then everybody else is
looking for a lottery ticket.

220
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:25,790
I used that analogy in
a podcast I just did

221
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,810
with some good guys.

222
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,660
And it hit me, maybe
because I was in Miami

223
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,700
and stayed at The Hard
Rock Casino fucking hotel,

224
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,150
which was fucking disgusting,

225
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,379
but a lot of people are
treating their business

226
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,919
the way you go to a casino.

227
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,879
Yeah, you could have one night

228
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,505
where you took 5,000 from the casino,

229
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:43,419
but why don't you keep going every night

230
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,200
and tell me how it works out?

231
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,902
They don't build Vegas on us winning,

232
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,750
and everybody's treating their
business that way right now.

233
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,719
Everybody's jumping from trend to trend,

234
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:55,300
they have no foundation of
what they're actually doing,

235
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,830
they're riding only headlines,

236
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,398
and they're gonna get exposed.

237
00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:01,849
Instead of taking a meaningful step back

238
00:09:01,849 --> 00:09:03,860
and doing a lot of thinking about:

239
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,266
A: How exciting it is to eat shit.

240
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:09,540
You know, the thing that works for me

241
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,640
that I really wished on everybody else

242
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,280
is I love the journey, I love the game.

243
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,410
I love the struggle.

244
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:22,347
- That was amazing, thank you.

245
00:09:22,347 --> 00:09:23,424
That was amazing.

246
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:25,260
And I loved that audience.

247
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,020
- I think the biggest
impact I'm having is,

248
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,400
there's a fuckload of 16
year old boys right now

249
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,464
who think I'm the coolest,

250
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:32,597
and I'm telling them to
stop buying fucking Supremes

251
00:09:32,597 --> 00:09:34,920
and stop disrespecting women,

252
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,215
and start fucking being
patient, and being kind,

253
00:09:37,215 --> 00:09:39,160
and I think my impact on that

254
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,316
is gonna be disproportionate
to writing checks.

255
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:43,571
- Right.

256
00:09:43,571 --> 00:09:46,940
- Okay, I'm thrilled to have that convo.

257
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,474
- Good to meet you.

258
00:09:48,474 --> 00:09:49,831
- Good meeting you man.

259
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:51,929
- [Gary] Real pleasure.

260
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:52,929
- Thank you.

261
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,527
- Life is good man, you
did a really nice shot.

262
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:02,360
I really mean that,

263
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,710
I don't throw around compliments so easy.

264
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,955
I was really, really,
really fucking impressed

265
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:07,573
with your presentation, it was real good.

266
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,265
- GaryVee, baby.

267
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:10,595
- What up, baby, how are you?

268
00:10:10,595 --> 00:10:11,550
Good?

269
00:10:16,178 --> 00:10:18,507
- I watch you every fucking
morning on the treadmill

270
00:10:18,507 --> 00:10:19,360
and I hate it,

271
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,783
I gotta tell you:

272
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:23,635
2016, negative $25,000 in debt.

273
00:10:23,635 --> 00:10:28,273
2017, made my first million
by applying your principles.

274
00:10:28,273 --> 00:10:31,241
Real estate will not die.

275
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:34,217
- Love you brother, congratulations.

276
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,400
That's incredible.

277
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,612
- [Man] Thank you!

00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:38,598

279
00:10:38,598 --> 00:10:39,684

281
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:41,563
- [Gary] How many?

282
00:10:41,563 --> 00:10:44,950
- [Woman] For one, at
least one a month, now.

283
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,951
More than that?

284
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:48,900
- [Gary] I did one a day,
and I had an audience.

285
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,760
Thank you guys, thank you, got it?

286
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,598
That is the absolute quickest way, 100%.

287
00:10:55,598 --> 00:10:56,770
- [Woman] What about,
what about like our guest?

288
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,770
What do you think about that?

289
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,120
- [Gary] That works too, of course.

290
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,990
It's siphoning off of
people's equity, right?

291
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,180
Okay, bye guys, thank you.

292
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,300
Bye guys, thank you for having me.

293
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,462
