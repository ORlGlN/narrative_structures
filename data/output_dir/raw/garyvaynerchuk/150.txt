1
00:00:00,276 --> 00:00:01,277
- You guys in?

2
00:00:01,277 --> 00:00:04,277
♫ We're unstoppable

3
00:00:06,187 --> 00:00:09,305
- Hello Vlog, live from Los Angeles.

4
00:00:09,305 --> 00:00:10,138
8:10am

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,509
PST.

6
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:17,683
About to go to a client
meeting here in L.A.

7
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:19,667
♫ There's a moment

8
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:20,992
♫ In your bones when

9
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,995
♫ When the fire takes over

10
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:26,945
♫ Blood is runnin', heart is pumpin'

11
00:00:26,945 --> 00:00:29,183
- Gonna run over to Vid Summit

12
00:00:29,183 --> 00:00:30,988
which should be really fun,

13
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:32,418
bunch of vloggers,

14
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:33,898
kind of the whole creator ecosystem.

15
00:00:33,898 --> 00:00:35,506
Something I'm proud to be a part of,

16
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:37,021
and back at the office.

17
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:39,557
And then a slew of VaynerSports meetings

18
00:00:39,557 --> 00:00:41,623
and then red eye to Cinci.

19
00:00:41,623 --> 00:00:44,102
♫ We can be heroes everywhere we go

20
00:00:44,102 --> 00:00:47,099
♫ We can have all that we ever want

21
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:48,809
♫ Swingin' like Ali

22
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,841
- On the phone with

23
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:52,622
Brandon from Wine Library.

24
00:00:52,622 --> 00:00:53,749
Like, whoa,

25
00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:55,596
I'm doing more than I thought I could do.

26
00:00:55,596 --> 00:00:57,432
Why should that only be you?

27
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,875
And when he says to you,

28
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,288
how do I do that, all?

29
00:01:00,288 --> 00:01:01,962
We're like, do it!

30
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:03,295
Let 'em go fast!

31
00:01:04,757 --> 00:01:08,096
With Jeff Nicholson, chief media officer.

32
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,613
Just gotta delegate it
and not be the bottleneck

33
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:12,803
and we gotta pick people
that can get things done

34
00:01:12,803 --> 00:01:14,593
and it's as simple as that.

35
00:01:14,593 --> 00:01:15,703
With Tyler

36
00:01:15,703 --> 00:01:18,036
No email left behind, Tyler!

37
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:20,578
CFO, thank you, D-Rock.

38
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:22,025
The thing that has always held back

39
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:23,750
when I'm not involved is

40
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,189
we go on defense, no
expenditures on offense

41
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:29,405
and then nothing happens.

42
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:30,513
You just decrease until you windle away.

43
00:01:30,513 --> 00:01:33,818
Same themes: what matters, what doesn't.

44
00:01:33,818 --> 00:01:36,357
At the end of the day, I think,

45
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:38,664
that has been one of
the bigger separations

46
00:01:38,664 --> 00:01:40,686
for me in my career from the pack

47
00:01:40,686 --> 00:01:42,969
and something that I would really,

48
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,940
you know how I say 99 percent
of things don't matter?

49
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,773
It's true.

50
00:01:48,895 --> 00:01:50,397
Just 99 percent of you

51
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:52,430
don't see it that way.

52
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,327
And you focus on things that don't matter

53
00:01:54,327 --> 00:01:55,763
and I think that

54
00:01:55,763 --> 00:01:57,830
that's something you should audit.

55
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,690
And that's something I audit
with myself all the time.

56
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,966
Every year I get better at

57
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:02,734
dropping things that don't matter.

58
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:03,935
Things change too

59
00:02:03,935 --> 00:02:05,110
that used to matter don't matter.

60
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,531
Things matter when you
have a two year old child

61
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:07,620
that don't at 13.

62
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,417
You can't parent a 13 year old

63
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:11,452
the way you parented them at two.

64
00:02:11,452 --> 00:02:12,285
So,

65
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,474
just a whole slew of one hour of

66
00:02:15,474 --> 00:02:17,571
this matters, this doesn't.

67
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:20,847
Let's focus on what
matters, let's execute.

68
00:02:20,847 --> 00:02:22,190
Vid Summit.

69
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,023
2017.

70
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,851
Shonduras!

71
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:28,676
Shonduras you cut your hair?

72
00:02:28,676 --> 00:02:29,548
- I did, it's shorter!

73
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:33,988
- [Gary] What are you,
like a professional now?

74
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,946
- Gary Vee's on the camera!

75
00:02:35,946 --> 00:02:37,304
- Vid Summit Verse One.

76
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:38,830
- Amazing.

77
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,745
S'up?

78
00:02:39,745 --> 00:02:41,734
Dude, it's incredible!

79
00:02:41,734 --> 00:02:42,915
- [Gary] Good to see you, brother.

80
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:44,280
- What up? How you doin'?
- A pleasure.

81
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,908
- You recognize this guy
waiting outside our office?

82
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:46,902
- [Gary] I sure do.

83
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:47,784
- He works here now!

84
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:48,617
- [Gary] Good to see you, man.

85
00:02:48,617 --> 00:02:49,575
- I work now.

86
00:02:49,575 --> 00:02:50,408
- [Gary] That's awesome.

87
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:51,405
- I work!

88
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,961
- [Gary] We got shitloads of salad.

89
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:56,552
Just an important moment in every vlog.

90
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,742
Just an enormous amount of salad.

91
00:02:58,742 --> 00:03:00,068
- [Man] Cool.

92
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:02,151
(laughs)

93
00:03:03,322 --> 00:03:04,533
- [Announcer] Gary V, guys!

94
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:07,700
(audience applauding)

95
00:03:09,316 --> 00:03:10,897
- This is what I'm most worried about.

96
00:03:10,897 --> 00:03:12,500
That you know it, that you're right,

97
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,758
you're here right now

98
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:15,538
and you're either not working hard enough

99
00:03:15,538 --> 00:03:17,263
or not believing enough in

100
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,030
how right you actually are.

101
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,627
And so when I really thought about

102
00:03:20,627 --> 00:03:22,245
the talk that I would give here

103
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,623
amongst everybody else,

104
00:03:23,623 --> 00:03:24,961
I just was like, fuck,

105
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:27,209
I'm gonna suffocate the
shit out of everybody.

106
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:29,885
(audience members laughing)

107
00:03:29,885 --> 00:03:31,584
In a very positive way.

108
00:03:31,584 --> 00:03:33,639
(audience laughs)

109
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,100
So that they understand,

110
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,961
please, please, please,

111
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:39,777
don't look back at this
talk in three years

112
00:03:39,777 --> 00:03:41,441
and be like, fuck, I
wish I listened to him

113
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:44,032
and I wish I did a little more work,

114
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:45,985
created a little more content,

115
00:03:45,985 --> 00:03:47,588
took it a little bit more serious.

116
00:03:47,588 --> 00:03:50,760
Because for the last decade of this

117
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,571
distribution disruption that

118
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:55,487
the internet has done to our society,

119
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:57,162
there have been people that have

120
00:03:57,162 --> 00:03:59,263
stumbled into the moment
that you're in right now.

121
00:03:59,263 --> 00:04:00,263
You're here.

122
00:04:01,437 --> 00:04:03,486
And just don't realize
how far ahead they are

123
00:04:03,486 --> 00:04:07,497
because you're stuck
being used to each other.

124
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,361
98 percent of America has no idea

125
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:13,194
what the fuck is going on in here.

126
00:04:15,826 --> 00:04:17,026
I thought that was really good, D-Rock.

127
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:18,265
- Yeah I feel like you did a good job.

128
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:19,861
- I felt really, really good about myself.

129
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:20,819
- Great.

130
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:22,327
- There were some good moments, right?

131
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:23,160
- Yeah.

132
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,664
- I'm really starting to
figure this thing out.

133
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,648
- I crowd surfed at a Gary Vee event!

134
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:28,941
I want to be the first
person to crowd surf

135
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:30,138
at a Gary Vee event.

136
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:31,096
Yeah!

137
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:32,240
Crowd surfing!

138
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,410
Crowd surfing!

139
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,232
(Gary laughs)

140
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:36,065
- T!

141
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:36,898
- What's up?

142
00:04:36,898 --> 00:04:38,532
- How we doin', man?
- Fine, man,

143
00:04:38,532 --> 00:04:39,613
I didn't know who you were before today,

144
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,605
but I do now and I'm very happy

145
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:43,390
- What about now!?
- I'm happy, man!

146
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,223
- Take care.

147
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:45,680
Thank you so much.

148
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,957
It's going pretty well,

149
00:04:47,957 --> 00:04:50,825
but there's a fuckload
more photos to take!

150
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:52,681
Dude, it's good to see you again.

151
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:54,002
- Dude it's really good to see you.

152
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:54,835
- Real pleasure.
- Yeah.

153
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:56,075
- [Man] Alright let me introduce you

154
00:04:56,075 --> 00:04:57,314
to a lot of my buddies here.

155
00:04:57,314 --> 00:04:58,200
- [Gary] Yes.

156
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,657
- So I'm a creator, and I'm a lawyer.

157
00:05:00,657 --> 00:05:02,283
And I wish we could help creators

158
00:05:02,283 --> 00:05:03,690
become more sophisticated.

159
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,731
So you got the agencies
right now in the space

160
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:09,395
and they're taking
sometimes 50, 60, 70 percent

161
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:10,710
of a brand deal.

162
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,707
- That's absurd.

163
00:05:11,707 --> 00:05:13,530
- A brand is paying all this money for

164
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,806
what they think it's worth

165
00:05:14,806 --> 00:05:16,233
and then the agency comes
to creator and says,

166
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,892
we'll give you,

167
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:18,994
- I get it.
- But the creator

168
00:05:18,994 --> 00:05:19,870
doesn't know that.

169
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,703
- I understand.

170
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:21,608
- I want to educate the creators

171
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:23,752
and speed up the industry so it can

172
00:05:23,752 --> 00:05:25,811
become more like what now
is the real estate industry

173
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:26,782
where it's like, look,

174
00:05:26,782 --> 00:05:28,253
there's a transparent fee

175
00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:29,837
that's related to the matchmaker,

176
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:30,711
the independent--

177
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:32,314
- You're gonna have a tough time because

178
00:05:32,314 --> 00:05:35,220
first of all, you don't
have to have a tough time,

179
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,261
just make content.

180
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:37,700
Like you're gonna make one video

181
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,917
that's gonna be like the secret

182
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:41,445
thing in influencer marketing

183
00:05:41,445 --> 00:05:42,592
and it just goes.

184
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,974
But it'll take time because there's

185
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:45,456
five major holding companies

186
00:05:45,456 --> 00:05:47,866
that control the
disproportionate amount of money

187
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:49,516
that's going in the advertising world.

188
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,600
And they have no interest
in what you're up to.

189
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,916
They want to make sure
they're hitting their numbers.

190
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:57,340
And they will fuckin' fight to keep it.

191
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,996
Why do you think TV still gets money?

192
00:05:58,996 --> 00:05:59,870
- Yeah.

193
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,291
So it's trying to turn the
tide as quick as possible.

194
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,320
- There's just a patience, the marathon

195
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,645
and the consistent piece of content.

196
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:06,923
You know what scared me?

197
00:06:06,923 --> 00:06:08,720
I'm saying shit I've been
saying for nine years

198
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,835
every fuckin' day!

199
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:10,668
- Yeah.

200
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:13,644
- It's like, you can't give up the fight.

201
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:16,499
Look at like, every issue in life.

202
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:18,835
Sexism, racism, escapism,

203
00:06:18,835 --> 00:06:19,752
everything.

204
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:22,599
It doesn't speed up.

205
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:23,432
- Yeah.

206
00:06:23,432 --> 00:06:24,655
- It just evolves.

207
00:06:24,655 --> 00:06:26,797
So you're not gonna be
able to boil the ocean.

208
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:27,630
- Sure.

209
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,763
- So I would say, play your little part.

210
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,267
You know how I think about stuff?

211
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,224
I'm not the biggest, I don't
have the biggest audience.

212
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:36,277
I think that I'm consistent
and put out good stuff,

213
00:06:36,277 --> 00:06:37,668
and then it influences people that have

214
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:39,076
even have bigger

215
00:06:39,076 --> 00:06:40,559
And that's what you want to do.

216
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:42,316
It doesn't matter how
many subscribers you have.

217
00:06:42,316 --> 00:06:44,784
You may make one piece
of content from a legal,

218
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:46,733
practical, authentic standpoint

219
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:49,788
that may get picked up by 2020.

220
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:52,491
And that helps a different
generation see it

221
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:53,926
in that 2020, 'cause

222
00:06:53,926 --> 00:06:55,585
the kids in the background watch it

223
00:06:55,585 --> 00:06:56,916
while their mom's watching CESA

224
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,402
and they make a video.

225
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:00,235
Patience.

226
00:07:00,235 --> 00:07:01,068
- Okay.

227
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:02,026
We'll keep doing it.

228
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:03,255
Thanks.
- Good luck, man.

229
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:05,187
- What's your vision in
terms of diversifying?

230
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:07,215
- Diversifying?
- Right now--

231
00:07:07,215 --> 00:07:08,201
- Like what I was talking
about in the audience?

232
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:09,751
- Yeah.
- Facebook.

233
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:12,184
Facebook Video is fuckin' real.

234
00:07:12,184 --> 00:07:13,274
- Yeah.

235
00:07:13,274 --> 00:07:14,983
- Like you guys could do so much damage.

236
00:07:14,983 --> 00:07:17,257
You could target people
that are fans of Nerf,

237
00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:18,172
the brand.

238
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:20,722
And put a video with you
doing Nerf shit in it.

239
00:07:20,722 --> 00:07:24,350
Like YouTube has nowhere
close to the capabilities

240
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,029
of targeting the right audience.

241
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,165
You could target 15 to 19 year old dudes

242
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:30,657
that are into Nerf.

243
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:32,844
Like the shit you can do on Facebook

244
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:33,894
is so bonkers.

245
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:34,727
- Yeah.

246
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:36,346
- And YouTube native
people never realize it

247
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:39,359
and Facebook is going to
build a huge video business.

248
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,394
- So you think Facebook
one day will be able to

249
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,614
compete with YouTube?

250
00:07:42,614 --> 00:07:43,447
- A hundred thousand percent.

251
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:45,261
I think Facebook competes
with YouTube right now!

252
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:47,082
Not in the way that we
all think of it here,

253
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:48,928
but it's kind of already happened.

254
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:50,374
- So Facebook--
- Like I do

255
00:07:50,374 --> 00:07:52,529
much more branding and winning on Facebook

256
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:55,102
than I do on YouTube.

257
00:07:55,102 --> 00:07:57,313
- And how does Facebook relate to YouTube?

258
00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:58,706
If you're doing something on Facebook,

259
00:07:58,706 --> 00:08:00,253
the cross traffic and all that

260
00:08:00,253 --> 00:08:02,572
- That's where hacking
with that left and right.

261
00:08:02,572 --> 00:08:04,536
But, I would highly recommend just

262
00:08:04,536 --> 00:08:07,816
to create a Watch channel, for yourselves.

263
00:08:07,816 --> 00:08:09,237
Just Google Facebook Watch

264
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:10,470
the new thing they have.

265
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,619
Try something.

266
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:12,996
So a lot of people who are doing

267
00:08:12,996 --> 00:08:14,360
second YouTube channels

268
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,616
should actually be creating a

269
00:08:15,616 --> 00:08:17,583
first Facebook Watch channel.

270
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,066
And just drive them there and

271
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:19,982
see what happens!

272
00:08:19,982 --> 00:08:22,067
Because remember, there
is not the same viral loop

273
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:25,549
on YouTube that there is on Facebook.

274
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:28,780
Meaning, YouTube algorithm
hacking can happen

275
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,594
and the machine gives you awareness.

276
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:31,903
But if you do something rad on Facebook

277
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:33,919
people are just sharing
the fuck out of it!

278
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,026
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

279
00:08:35,027 --> 00:08:35,994
- Got it?

280
00:08:35,994 --> 00:08:37,376
Facebook. Take it seriously.

281
00:08:37,376 --> 00:08:38,208
- Awesome.

282
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,662
- And make one minute version

283
00:08:39,663 --> 00:08:41,936
recap videos on Instagram
and drive them to YouTube.

284
00:08:41,936 --> 00:08:43,345
- So the other thing you were saying is

285
00:08:43,345 --> 00:08:44,568
Facebook has a different style.

286
00:08:44,568 --> 00:08:45,807
- 100 percent, you gotta get used

287
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:47,620
and you figured out the YouTube thing.

288
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,027
Figure out the cadence and
the vibe of the other ones.

289
00:08:50,027 --> 00:08:51,032
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

290
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:52,175
- Cool.
- It's awesome.

291
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:53,197
- Sweet, thank you.
- Real pleasure,

292
00:08:53,197 --> 00:08:54,178
good luck to you guys.

293
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:55,303
Good luck.

294
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:57,050
Dude, so glad we met man.

295
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,397
Thanks for collabin'.

296
00:08:58,397 --> 00:08:59,448
Thanks for stopping through.

297
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:00,717
- Thank you for having me.

298
00:09:00,717 --> 00:09:01,675
- Yeah of course, brother man.

299
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:02,508
How are you?

300
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,473
- Doing well, doing well.

301
00:09:03,473 --> 00:09:04,306
- Good, man.

302
00:09:04,306 --> 00:09:05,472
What's up man?

303
00:09:05,472 --> 00:09:06,348
- How you doing?

304
00:09:06,348 --> 00:09:07,181
Anthony.

305
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:08,299
- Real pleasure, my man.

306
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,177
Real pleasure.

307
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:10,558
How are you?

308
00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:11,564
Real pleasure.

309
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:15,176
To me, I think if you
overthink prioritization,

310
00:09:15,176 --> 00:09:16,602
you're gonna slow down.

311
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:19,192
What got you here was you
not thinking about that.

312
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,025
- That's true.

313
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:21,566
- Right?
- Yeah.

314
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:22,781
- So even at the place that I'm at,

315
00:09:22,781 --> 00:09:23,739
a lot of times I just
don't overthink that.

316
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:25,100
You know, I know I'm doing my things

317
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,701
I got the VaynerMedia thing,

318
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:28,071
I got my brand, I got my family,

319
00:09:28,071 --> 00:09:29,944
I'm trying to buy the Jets.

320
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:30,777
- Yeah.

321
00:09:30,777 --> 00:09:31,828
- I know what I'm doing,

322
00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:33,784
but on a micro,

323
00:09:33,784 --> 00:09:35,224
I'm not as crippled of,

324
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:36,676
should I spend an extra
15 hours on the project

325
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,623
and the mixtape versus

326
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:40,763
should a blow up a second YouTube channel

327
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:43,388
versus should I get on Facebook Watch?

328
00:09:43,388 --> 00:09:44,346
Know what I mean?

329
00:09:44,346 --> 00:09:45,490
- Spending all your time focusing on--

330
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,395
- I think people overthink shit,

331
00:09:46,395 --> 00:09:47,642
and I'm just in the yes, yes, yes

332
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:49,138
and you start surrounding
yourself with people

333
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:49,971
and just,

334
00:09:49,971 --> 00:09:52,777
to me, one of the things
that Shonduras has done

335
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:54,383
that I'm passionate about is,

336
00:09:54,383 --> 00:09:57,011
I'm watching him navigate
what I did which is

337
00:09:57,011 --> 00:10:01,038
surround himself with
people that can do shit.

338
00:10:01,038 --> 00:10:03,531
The answer is always, always people.

339
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:04,364
- Yeah.

340
00:10:04,364 --> 00:10:05,975
- The answer to all your problems

341
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:07,934
slash opportunities

342
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:09,964
is more fuckin' homies you trust.

343
00:10:09,964 --> 00:10:11,378
- Yeah, gettin' the right people.

344
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:13,116
- When people talk about machine learning

345
00:10:13,116 --> 00:10:14,527
eliminating jobs,

346
00:10:14,527 --> 00:10:16,950
these two brothers, they're going to have

347
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,787
57 people working for
them if they do it right.

348
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:20,790
Not one or two.

349
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,192
Like you become a media company.

350
00:10:23,192 --> 00:10:24,462
I got 17

351
00:10:24,462 --> 00:10:27,305
full-time employees working on brand Gary

352
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:29,004
and we're not even doing half the shit

353
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,240
that's on my mind.

354
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,371
We don't even have a Biz Dev guy!

355
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:34,538
Making real fuckin' money.

356
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:38,271
So, that's the best piece of advice

357
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:39,630
I can give you.
- Definitely.

358
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,074
- Don't beat yourself up and always

359
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,127
keep looking for people.

360
00:10:42,127 --> 00:10:44,211
That's what you three need to be doing.

361
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:45,675
Just keep looking for people,

362
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:48,763
normally fans that are just good,

363
00:10:48,763 --> 00:10:50,308
and just figure out what they're good at.

364
00:10:50,308 --> 00:10:51,960
- [Man] You grab that, I grab the lunch.

365
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,041
- We got lunch, we got meetings,

366
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,316
we got Troy here taking a selfie.

367
00:10:56,316 --> 00:10:57,399
- [Man] Troy!

368
00:10:58,585 --> 00:10:59,471
(camera snap)

369
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:00,732
- Take care, Troy.
- Great to meet you.

370
00:11:00,732 --> 00:11:01,898
- [Man] One more time, Gary.

371
00:11:01,898 --> 00:11:03,227
- Let's do it.
- Milton Lawrence.

372
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:04,475
- Yes, tell 'em.

373
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:05,349
Tell 'em.

374
00:11:05,349 --> 00:11:06,462
- So I produced my new show called

375
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:07,420
Will You Marry Me?

376
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,417
It's coming out here on Thanksgiving

377
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,041
but I wanted to ask you
man, really quickly.

378
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,037
We have the entire
season already produced.

379
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:14,379
- Yes.
- What I wanted to find out

380
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:16,480
is, I wasn't sure whether
to do it on Facebook

381
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,657
and/or YouTube.

382
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:19,036
- I would do Facebook.
- Really!

383
00:11:19,036 --> 00:11:20,034
- Really.

384
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:21,158
Because there's a white space.

385
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:21,991
They're pushing stuff.

386
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:23,032
Start a Watch channel.

387
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:24,268
- Okay.
- And put it on Facebook.

388
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:25,271
And then run some ads

389
00:11:25,271 --> 00:11:27,775
against people that like
that kind of content.

390
00:11:27,775 --> 00:11:30,192
- So weddings--
- You got it.

391
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:31,994
Got it?

392
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:33,045
- Thank you.
- Take care.

393
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:36,113
(modern hip hop music)

394
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,330
- [Man] See you, man!

395
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,163
Oh, yes!

396
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,423
- Veggies.

397
00:11:42,423 --> 00:11:44,917
I'm a huge fan of veggies.

398
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:46,651
Here's an interesting question.

399
00:11:46,651 --> 00:11:49,290
Vlog, what do you like more,

400
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,516
Carrots

401
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:52,346
or broccoli?

402
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:53,940
Leave a comment below.

403
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,339
One of you is gonna get

404
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,734
a thousand dollars worth
of carrots or broccoli.

405
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:02,428
♫ I been thinkin' love is overrated lately

406
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:04,958
♫ Only say that 'cause I ain't got a lady

407
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,665
♫ You don't know me you ain't heard about

408
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:09,154
♫ That awesome thing lately

409
00:12:09,154 --> 00:12:11,498
- That's all one, right?

410
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,331
When can I get a pair?

411
00:12:14,374 --> 00:12:15,834
Should I start getting people excited?

412
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:16,865
I should, right?

413
00:12:16,865 --> 00:12:18,573
Like it's time to start getting

414
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:19,986
Guys, it's comin'!

415
00:12:19,986 --> 00:12:20,819
- Uh oh.

416
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:22,304
- It's fuckin' comin'!

417
00:12:22,304 --> 00:12:24,791
11/14, get on it!

418
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,286
We're gonna sell them out in one second.

419
00:12:27,286 --> 00:12:28,390
But I'm telling you right now,

420
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,607
just to give you momentum.

421
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:31,238
Honestly, here's my plan.

422
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:33,874
There's not a shoe to be had on Earth

423
00:12:33,874 --> 00:12:35,007
on Thanksgiving.

424
00:12:35,007 --> 00:12:36,530
10 days, all gone.

425
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,363
All out of the system.

426
00:12:39,463 --> 00:12:41,221
Vayner Nation, Vlog.

427
00:12:41,221 --> 00:12:44,726
We're having our Gary Vee
sneaker meeting right now.

428
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:46,370
You just heard it, I promised.

429
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,787
All fuckin',

430
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:49,231
what do we got here?

431
00:12:49,231 --> 00:12:50,968
Two, three thousand pairs.

432
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:52,895
We need 'em all out

433
00:12:52,895 --> 00:12:54,345
in 10 days.

434
00:12:54,345 --> 00:12:57,561
I don't want a fuckin'
sneaker in the world.

435
00:12:57,561 --> 00:13:00,389
Christmas presents, Hanukkah, fuckin',

436
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:02,197
- If you can't get them,

437
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:03,219
email Patrick.

438
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:05,118
(laughs)

439
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,846
- Vlog, you guys in?

440
00:13:06,846 --> 00:13:08,907
I am, but, they fucked up my car.

441
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:11,807
Can I call you back in like four minutes?

442
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,794
Heading to some VaynerSports meetings.

443
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,732
Just had a great sneaker meeting.

444
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:20,180
GaryVees dropping November 14th.

445
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,474
Get your pair.

446
00:13:21,474 --> 00:13:22,935
Long fuckin' day.

447
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,458
- If you were us right now,

448
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,598
you would stick around and be the

449
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:26,714
last person to talk to you.

450
00:13:26,714 --> 00:13:28,396
So that's exactly what we're doing.

451
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:29,252
- I love it.

452
00:13:29,252 --> 00:13:30,950
- And are asking for the
biggest piece of advice.

453
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,821
If there was one thing
that you'd recommend

454
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:34,151
to us as business majors,

455
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:35,458
no technical skills but

456
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,933
don't want to be a wantrepreneur,

457
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:38,295
we want to be an entrepreneur.

458
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:39,616
What would you say?

459
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:41,056
- I think, look, the thing that you've got

460
00:13:41,056 --> 00:13:43,127
in your advantage is your youth.

461
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:44,716
You have so much time.

462
00:13:44,716 --> 00:13:46,602
The biggest problem right now,

463
00:13:46,602 --> 00:13:48,045
and it's not even remotely close,

464
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:50,462
there's nothing secondary, is

465
00:13:52,952 --> 00:13:55,535
people just want shit too fast.

466
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,456
I didn't do shit from 20 to 30.

467
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:01,697
Fuckin' worked 15 hours a day

468
00:14:01,697 --> 00:14:03,035
in a liquor store every day.

469
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:03,993
You know

470
00:14:03,993 --> 00:14:04,826
- We know the whole story!

471
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:05,659
Trust me.

472
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:07,268
- My advice is very simple.

473
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:08,490
I think right now,

474
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,555
in the instant gratification world,

475
00:14:10,555 --> 00:14:12,843
it's hard to not get seduced by

476
00:14:12,843 --> 00:14:14,966
the good stuff that comes along.

477
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:17,633
I think real entrepreneurship is

478
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,859
being super interested in eating shit

479
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:24,662
for the next seven, eight, nine years

480
00:14:24,662 --> 00:14:25,744
for real!

481
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:27,402
- No vacation, no summer.

482
00:14:27,402 --> 00:14:28,253
- Yeah!

483
00:14:28,253 --> 00:14:29,211
It's just like,

484
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:30,125
that's the advantage.

485
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,434
That's what you have.

486
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:32,267
- Right.

487
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:34,155
- You don't have the bank account yet.

488
00:14:34,155 --> 00:14:35,665
You have the time!

489
00:14:35,665 --> 00:14:37,230
You have the fact that it's

490
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,773
easy for you to, fuckin,

491
00:14:38,773 --> 00:14:40,671
stay up 'til three in the morning

492
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,927
every fuckin' day,

493
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:43,895
and just fucking grind, right?

494
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:46,101
You have the luxury of

495
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:48,198
looking at the world with naive eyes

496
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:49,223
and being like,

497
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:50,402
why can't we?

498
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:51,273
Right?

499
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:52,136
- Right.

500
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:55,280
- It's one big game of fuckin'
playing to your strengths.

501
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,475
- Playing to your strengths, yeah.

502
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:57,642
- 100 percent.

503
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:00,683
The other thing is,

504
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:01,615
I wouldn't raise any money.

505
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:02,448
- Really!

506
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:03,281
- Yeah.

507
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:04,114
- Never heard that.

508
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:05,003
Wait, why?

509
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:06,276
- Never heard that before.

510
00:15:06,276 --> 00:15:07,795
- I think raising money has caused

511
00:15:07,795 --> 00:15:11,378
a lot of kids to not
be good entrepreneurs.

512
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,972
They pander to

513
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:15,633
raising more money,

514
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:18,891
and so you become a
financial arbitrage machine

515
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:20,684
instead of actually building a business.

516
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:23,194
VaynerMedia is a $125
million dollar business

517
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:24,695
that I never raised a penny for.

518
00:15:24,695 --> 00:15:25,904
I figured out somebody to sell a

519
00:15:25,904 --> 00:15:28,242
$40,000 dollar campaign in the beginning.

520
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:30,575
And then, the money we used.

521
00:15:32,353 --> 00:15:33,186
- You heading out?

522
00:15:33,186 --> 00:15:34,232
I need a hug.

523
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:35,065
- You got it, bud.

524
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:36,023
Good luck to you, man.

525
00:15:36,023 --> 00:15:36,856
- Thank you so much.

526
00:15:36,856 --> 00:15:38,078
- Yes, let's get in here.

527
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:41,185
(modern hip hop music)

528
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:42,054
I'm tired.

529
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:43,106
- [Man] Long day, huh?

530
00:15:43,106 --> 00:00:00,000
- Yeah.
