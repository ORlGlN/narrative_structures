everything's global now so

it's not really shut down.

actually you 
know what, (censored)?

Here's actually 
the right answer.

74
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,674
(censored), if you're following
this along I think one of the

75
00:03:57,674 --> 00:04:01,713
things to keep in mind is to go
a different route which is the

76
00:04:01,713 --> 00:04:05,199
(censored) is best used to
kind of make you guys crush it

keep this in the back of your

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,682
mind as you allocate money,
if it is not as successful the

79
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:14,848
things we'll learn in those two,
here we are three weeks later

80
00:04:14,848 --> 00:04:18,438
and it's not selling as well as
you wanted our paid efforts will

81
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:22,220
give us indicators on what's
working best and we may be able

82
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,877
to come back and say, look,
let's spend some more money

00:04:25,877 --> 00:04:27,742

and let's be like methodical.

Exactly, exactly.

86
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:38,111
One of the other things is 
I want to not only be successful

87
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,514
in what we're doing for them.

88
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,282
I want to be quite strategic

89
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,520
creatively around pushing
the boundaries so that maybe

90
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,023
(censored) above and beyond
actually succeeding in what the

91
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:54,641

opportunity to possibly,

92
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:58,331
you know, be put on a pedestal
by Facebook itself as best in

94
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,338
would then have impact 
on (censored) going forward.

95
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,675
Maybe even giving (censored)
team leverage to signing a

longer-term deal with the
clubs or things that nature.

97
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:15,418
So, my ambitions for this video

98
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:18,918
are extremely high because the

99
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,489
upside is just so incredible to
my business partners who own the

100
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,659

we need to really,

101
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,663
really think in 
terms of innovative,

00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,231
not only does it 
have to be emotional,

103
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:34,070
but much like 
the Sandy Hook PSA,

104
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,835
I think it needs 
to shock people.

105
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:40,140

figure out how to like really,

really, really make an 
impact above and beyond.

00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:47,414

is not only does it succeed in

00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:51,518
driving awareness and sell
(censored) but that it beats out,

it a little bit but

to get a chance to speak with

169
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,777
you about a job opportunity.

Done, it's probably not next

187
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:15,309
following week, you know?

188
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:18,590
Alright, get him
