1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,449
- [Man] I really need the meme video

2
00:00:02,449 --> 00:00:05,817
of a Jets fan talks to a Patriots fan.

3
00:00:05,817 --> 00:00:06,650
- Oh yeah, I'll get that.

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:07,742
- Where I destroy that kid.

5
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:11,645
♫ We're unstoppable ♫

6
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:12,520
What time is it?

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,478
2:10.

8
00:00:13,478 --> 00:00:14,311
2:10 p.m.

9
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:18,589
Team Gary off-site had
the, early this morning

10
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:21,750
had the people from Vayner
Productions and the creative team

11
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,369
and the CFO come out here,
as well, for an off-site

12
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:27,556
to get Vayner Media and
Vayner Productions aligned

13
00:00:27,556 --> 00:00:29,226
on how we produce and all that stuff,

14
00:00:29,226 --> 00:00:30,533
super excited about that.

15
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:32,400
Now, here with 20 or so homies.

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,067
(hip hop music)

17
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:39,017
Huge, huge miss by Babin.

18
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:41,024
To start off, he was
supposed to be filming

19
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:42,876
the last four hours of this.

20
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,505
We went around and kinda got
acquainted with each other,

21
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:46,687
with updates.

22
00:00:46,687 --> 00:00:50,641
Started working on my kind
of text, CRM infrastructure.

23
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:53,442
Did a lot of awesome
stuff, lost now in history

24
00:00:53,442 --> 00:00:55,320
'cause when I yelled at Babin,

25
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,458
"Hey Babin, weren't you supposed
to be filming all this?"

26
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:00,092
His amazing reply was, "Oh, yeah."

27
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:01,260
That's where were at right now.

28
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,401
Now we're talking about
the Gary Vee search engine.

29
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:04,921
If you go garyvaynerchuk.com,

30
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:06,661
under Ask Gary Vee,
there's a search engine.

31
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:08,714
We're developing a 2.0 version on that.

32
00:01:08,714 --> 00:01:11,107
Gotta work with Castner,
Andy, the rest of the team.

33
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:13,123
So, just some team bonding.

34
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:16,022
Some strategies around creative utility

35
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:17,859
and all the projects I'm working on,

36
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:19,662
whether it's the K-Swiss, the book,

37
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,520
the wine club, hip hop collaborations,

38
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,838
just really focusing.

39
00:01:23,838 --> 00:01:25,680
This new search engine that you guys have,

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,810
if you wanna pull it up Andy.

41
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,050
Supposedly this is better
than what we had, right?

42
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:29,883
- Better.
- Good.

43
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:30,716
- [Man] Because it's all content,

44
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:31,549
and it plays from the moment.

45
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,054
- [Man] It's all YouTube.

46
00:01:33,054 --> 00:01:33,887
- [Gary] Good.

47
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:35,448
So put in Snapchat.

48
00:01:35,448 --> 00:01:37,316
Yeah, this is fuckin' awesome.

49
00:01:37,316 --> 00:01:39,334
- It's using Daily Vee too, right?

50
00:01:39,334 --> 00:01:41,452
- Yeah, so hit, so hit key notes,

51
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:43,021
hit key notes just for a second.

52
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:45,387
- Type in Instagram, it should
be a Daily Vee that pulls up

53
00:01:45,387 --> 00:01:46,546
versus an Ask Gary Vee video.

54
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:47,409
- [Gary] Hold on.

55
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:49,078
But you can get by Daily Vee anyways.

56
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:50,428
- [Man] No, I'm saying all.

57
00:01:50,428 --> 00:01:51,261
- [Man] Hit all.

58
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:52,832
- [Man] Hit all, and then
I wanna see what comes up.

59
00:01:52,832 --> 00:01:54,109
- It's super random, but who cares?

60
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:56,376
That's super easy.

61
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:57,842
We would go by most recent.

62
00:01:57,842 --> 00:01:59,125
- [Man] We do have to get
Facebook content on there too.

63
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,275
- I think it's very important.

64
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:01,554
- We're debating the Ask Gary Vee,

65
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:05,838
the Gary Vee actual search
engine transcribing.

66
00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:08,507
As some of you guys know,
on my website Ask Gary Vee,

67
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:11,790
tab on my website, you can search any word

68
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,627
and get the information.

69
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:15,313
We know this is valuable.

70
00:02:15,313 --> 00:02:17,391
We've got content on the podcast,

71
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:20,276
we've got content on the YouTube channel.

72
00:02:20,276 --> 00:02:22,792
We're moving to Ask Gary
Vee on Facebook only.

73
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:23,837
So, we're just debating it.

74
00:02:23,837 --> 00:02:26,954
And then debating if it's
even worth it right now.

75
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:29,689
- Internally, I think it's 100% worth it.

76
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:31,744
- Kendall or Iris or somebody, Justin,

77
00:02:31,744 --> 00:02:35,000
can I get the, I really
need the meme video

78
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,428
of a Jets fan talks to a Patriots fan.

79
00:02:38,428 --> 00:02:39,261
- Oh yeah, I'll get that for you.

80
00:02:39,261 --> 00:02:40,248
- Where I destroy that kid.

81
00:02:40,248 --> 00:02:41,432
So, I get to Boise.

82
00:02:41,432 --> 00:02:42,440
I meet this kid.

83
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,998
- Josh, it was nice meeting
you in the airport, man.

84
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:49,240
- Later at the conference,
he asks this question

85
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,678
and he asks me, and at the
end he tries to razz me,

86
00:02:51,678 --> 00:02:52,511
he's like--

87
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:54,690
- [Josh] If Tom Brady makes it
to the Super Bowl this year,

88
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,416
will you go to the Super
Bowl with me on me?

89
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,249
- No.

90
00:02:58,249 --> 00:03:01,193
I have not watched the
Patriots play a down

91
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:03,529
of a Super Bowl game in
the last four Super Bowls

92
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:05,546
that they've played in, because I refuse.

93
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:07,865
Everybody's like the greatest
comeback in a Super Bowl.

94
00:03:07,865 --> 00:03:08,698
I'm good.

95
00:03:08,698 --> 00:03:10,049
I have no idea what the fuck
you guys are talking about,

96
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:10,946
I didn't see shit.

97
00:03:10,946 --> 00:03:11,813
(laughter)

98
00:03:11,813 --> 00:03:12,780
- [Josh] You like winners,

99
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,044
and I'd like to invite you to be a winner.

100
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:15,242
- Why don't we hang out and I'll come

101
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:17,881
and show you what real winners,

102
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:20,008
you know, you'll get to see
real winners play, right?

103
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:21,262
You're a Jets fan, I'm a Patriots fan,

104
00:03:21,262 --> 00:03:22,861
I'm gonna show you how real winning looks

105
00:03:22,861 --> 00:03:24,021
or something, I go--

106
00:03:24,021 --> 00:03:25,300
- No, no, no, no, Josh.

107
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,570
Josh, you're confused, my friend.

108
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,616
I'm a winner.

109
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:30,158
You root for winners, dick.

110
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:32,408
(laughter)

111
00:03:33,837 --> 00:03:34,708
Be careful.

112
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,213
- Maybe we should title it When Jets Fans

113
00:03:36,213 --> 00:03:38,132
Actually Beat Patriot Fans, or something.

114
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:39,876
We gotta figure out the right title.

115
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:40,970
I want Super Phone.

116
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,131
Like, if we leave here in a couple hours

117
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:46,205
and nothing was accomplished,
I'm gonna kill somebody.

118
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:47,570
Like Super Phone should be done.

119
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,205
I actually do engagement.

120
00:03:49,205 --> 00:03:50,390
Like, I'm just hitting up these people.

121
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,557
Is this a bot?

122
00:03:52,596 --> 00:03:53,429
Watch this.

123
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:54,487
Camera.

124
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:55,681
Okay.

125
00:03:55,681 --> 00:03:56,953
Reverse.

126
00:03:56,953 --> 00:03:57,866
Video.

127
00:03:57,866 --> 00:03:58,699
Okay.

128
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:00,340
- [Man] 10 episodes.

129
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,173
- Three days in New York.

130
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:03,135
- If my name is Bot now, it is.

131
00:04:03,135 --> 00:04:05,385
(laughter)

132
00:04:08,218 --> 00:04:09,689
I mean, that guy is gonna shit in his taxi

133
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:10,903
getting that video.

134
00:04:10,903 --> 00:04:12,136
Ready?
- Go.

135
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:14,530
- Hey guys, it's Gary Vaynerchuk.

136
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,034
Dressed down and excited for

137
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:19,017
the first Monthly Wine Club of October.

138
00:04:19,017 --> 00:04:20,866
First of all, I want to start with

139
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:24,726
thanking everybody for subscribing
to the Monthly Wine Club.

140
00:04:24,726 --> 00:04:27,152
My big goal is to create the most epic,

141
00:04:27,152 --> 00:04:30,178
the coolest, the best
wine club in the world.

142
00:04:30,178 --> 00:04:32,855
And I hope you enjoyed our
first interaction together.

143
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,043
If you want to join my Monthly Wine Club,

144
00:04:35,043 --> 00:04:38,218
go to winelibrary.com
and search Gary V-E-E.

145
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:40,350
YouTube, right now I'm recording

146
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,269
for the Alexa skill for Wine Library,

147
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:44,974
which is coming out soon.

148
00:04:44,974 --> 00:04:47,628
So, just say "start tasting" to Alexa,

149
00:04:47,628 --> 00:04:49,024
and let's rock and roll.

150
00:04:49,024 --> 00:04:51,313
Awesome, what I want to do
is I don't want the back,

151
00:04:51,313 --> 00:04:52,720
I want them to like be floating.

152
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,557
I don't want the back.

153
00:04:53,557 --> 00:04:54,390
- Yeah, that's fine.

154
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,223
- Got it, got it.

155
00:04:55,223 --> 00:04:57,069
These are just kinda all over it now.

156
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:57,902
- Perfect.

157
00:04:57,902 --> 00:04:58,735
- Sweet.

158
00:04:58,735 --> 00:05:00,253
- And then you'll show
me a three, two, and one?

159
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:01,086
- Yep.

160
00:05:01,086 --> 00:05:02,319
- What's the update?

161
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,397
- So, we're trying to get a hotspot,

162
00:05:04,397 --> 00:05:07,905
so we can go on Girlpower
and update all the--

163
00:05:07,905 --> 00:05:09,189
- Do we have any actions?

164
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:10,715
Did you get good audio or was it--

165
00:05:10,715 --> 00:05:12,527
- The audio's like pretty not--

166
00:05:12,527 --> 00:05:13,852
- You're gonna transcribe it, right?

167
00:05:13,852 --> 00:05:14,884
- Yeah.
- Okay.

168
00:05:14,884 --> 00:05:15,812
Okay, I love it.

169
00:05:15,812 --> 00:05:17,439
So, I like everything.

170
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,154
You can keep it from that part.

171
00:05:19,154 --> 00:05:20,271
Like, I like where,

172
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:21,505
all you have to do is,

173
00:05:21,505 --> 00:05:23,102
when you made that thing,

174
00:05:23,102 --> 00:05:24,466
I want you to take over the whole screen,

175
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:26,962
put it in green, just green lettering,

176
00:05:26,962 --> 00:05:27,832
and just like really impact,

177
00:05:27,832 --> 00:05:29,279
like good design in it,
like the design in that,

178
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,275
and just put like, "this
is where it turns."

179
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:32,108
- Mm-hmm.

180
00:05:32,108 --> 00:05:32,941
(audio playing on phone)

181
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:35,323
- Episode 292 just dropped.

182
00:05:35,323 --> 00:05:36,527
Getting in the comments.

183
00:05:36,527 --> 00:05:38,800
(audio playing on phone)

184
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,551
Lander Hendrickx likes the editing.

185
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:42,816
That's for you, Babin.

186
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:44,873
Just trying to build your self esteem up.

187
00:05:44,873 --> 00:05:46,246
(laughter)

188
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,242
Um, see what else is happening.

189
00:05:47,242 --> 00:05:48,310
(laughter)

190
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,703
You like that one, Seth?

191
00:05:49,703 --> 00:05:50,536
Why was that so funny?

192
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:51,465
I thought that was subtle.

193
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:52,503
(laughter)

194
00:05:52,503 --> 00:05:53,560
Hey, you know what, I
might have all of you guys

195
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,443
travel with me now.

196
00:05:54,443 --> 00:05:57,184
I like the laugh track.

197
00:05:57,184 --> 00:05:59,378
This is the theme.

198
00:05:59,378 --> 00:06:01,885
CWorldIntergalactic mentions,

199
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:03,227
and he's one of four people,

200
00:06:03,227 --> 00:06:04,982
she or he is one of four people,

201
00:06:04,982 --> 00:06:06,584
the die on your own sword part,

202
00:06:06,584 --> 00:06:08,962
which I obviously was the focus of this,

203
00:06:08,962 --> 00:06:11,057
is so imperative.

204
00:06:11,057 --> 00:06:12,088
I'm glad to see a lot of people

205
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:14,144
understand where I'm coming from in that.

206
00:06:14,144 --> 00:06:16,510
Too many people conforming
and are gonna end up losing.

207
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,263
And that's like a double loss.

208
00:06:18,263 --> 00:06:20,706
You're just better off
holding your, your conviction,

209
00:06:20,706 --> 00:06:22,952
and if you lose, at
least you only lost once.

210
00:06:22,952 --> 00:06:23,808
A lot of people don't realize

211
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:25,886
they're on a path of oh and two.

212
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,068
And if I'm gonna lose, I'd
rather be one and one, right?

213
00:06:29,068 --> 00:06:31,194
(audio playing on phone)

214
00:06:31,194 --> 00:06:33,705
Paulinejustliving says,
"the title nailed it,

215
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:36,487
"the description nailed it."

216
00:06:36,487 --> 00:06:37,653
Good job, copy team.

217
00:06:37,653 --> 00:06:41,283
Comic Devour, amazing
observation in the workout video.

218
00:06:41,283 --> 00:06:42,384
Yes, that is correct.

219
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:43,596
That is a bald bull.

220
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:45,342
Mike Tyson's punch-out t-shirt.

221
00:06:45,342 --> 00:06:46,175
Good job.

222
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:47,628
(audio playing on phone)

223
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:49,616
I like you characters in the comments.

224
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:51,478
You're just giving me feedback and love.

225
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:52,900
I love that.

226
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,938
Michael Ruscito says, "D-rock
did you edit this one?

227
00:06:55,938 --> 00:06:57,691
"Very, very good edit job."

228
00:06:57,691 --> 00:06:59,992
The answer to that is, he sure didn't.

229
00:06:59,992 --> 00:07:00,928
I love that people,

230
00:07:00,928 --> 00:07:02,781
let's just keep it on
his face the whole time.

231
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:03,614
- Alright.

232
00:07:03,614 --> 00:07:04,447
- [Gary] Seth's enjoying it.

233
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,415
Seth, you think everything's funny today.

234
00:07:06,415 --> 00:07:07,248
- Everything's funny.

235
00:07:07,248 --> 00:07:08,081
- Handles everywhere.

236
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:08,914
- Handles on handles.

237
00:07:08,914 --> 00:07:09,790
- Babin, Babin, Babin.

238
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,472
- Guys, it's Gary Vaynerchuk.

239
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,109
You are seeing this video,

240
00:07:13,109 --> 00:07:17,600
because I am announcing
the Digital Uncorked series

241
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,920
by Vayner Media.

242
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,727
- Josh, what are you asking?

243
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:22,171
I'll give you the answer.

244
00:07:22,171 --> 00:07:23,390
I'm a winner.

245
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,904
You root for winners, dick.

246
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:27,761
(laughter on phone)

247
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:29,221
- Having these off-sites is important.

248
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:31,167
You gotta break the
patterns, break the rhythms.

249
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:32,241
Get everybody aligned.

250
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:33,865
Get everybody aligned on the same mission,

251
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:35,110
what are we doing here.

252
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,706
I feel good about today so far.

253
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,539
Good day.

254
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:38,950
I feel like we're wrapping up soon.

255
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,846
You know, some people
performed better than others.

256
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:42,773
We know who they are.

257
00:07:42,773 --> 00:00:00,000
(smooth music)
