00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,479
the topic fantasy sports are the reason

55
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">I watch baseball I love the Jets and</font>

56

that's why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch football but for</font>

57
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,030
basketball and hockey I fallen off

58
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,740
considerably over the last decade I

59
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,329
don't know every basketball player

60
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,130
anymore had I be playing fantasy

61
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,320
basketball every year<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guarantee you</font>

62
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,330
that I would I know minor league players

63
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">in baseball backups I know them all</font>

64
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">strictly because of fantasies</font>

65
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,260
for San at books what keeps me um you

66
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,970
know captivated now the NFL<font color="#CCCCCC"> has done a</font>

67
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,710
much better job than baseball they have

68
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,060
the red zone cam right because

69
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,500
somebody's about to score on directv on

70
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,990
all their channels they have savantis

71
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,090
eSports implications ESPN those fantasy

72
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,970
sports uh you know things for<font color="#E5E5E5"> football</font>

73
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,290
much more than they do for baseball if

74
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,850
you pay attention I think baseball has

75
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,370
missed a huge opportunity to build it

76
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,990
into there ballparks into their

77
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,240
marketing into the way they go out after

78
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,420
fans huge mistake huge mistake by Major

79
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,160
League Baseball by not embracing it more

80
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,870
there should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot more activities</font>

81
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,790
around fantasy baseball for baseball

82
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,110
because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> your growth would be</font>

83
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,510
higher and you're more potential back to

84
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,450
the real point secondary business why

85
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,220
your social networks important for every

86
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,660

them shouldn't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> be everywhere you can</font>

92
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,250
asking what social networks to be on

93
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,650
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking ten years ago should I</font>

94
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,900
only advertise on radio or newspaper or
