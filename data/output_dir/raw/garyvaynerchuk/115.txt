1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,734
- Everybody loses.

2
00:00:01,734 --> 00:00:05,974
And I thought this would
be a very public loss.

3
00:00:05,974 --> 00:00:08,095
If, it could've been, I
mean, now it's post-game,

4
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:09,080
it won.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,569
It won so much more than maybe
I even could've imagined,

6
00:00:11,569 --> 00:00:14,201
it's completely changed
my brand in culture,

7
00:00:14,201 --> 00:00:16,445
in a way that has opened
up in the last 48 hours,

8
00:00:16,445 --> 00:00:17,950
financially, the things
that have opened up for me

9
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,222
are ridiculous.

10
00:00:19,222 --> 00:00:20,888
- Really? ...'cause sneakers?
- Yeah, because, here's why,

11
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:23,781
because sneakers are so
part of culture right now,

12
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:25,174
and you may be privy to it, you may not,

13
00:00:25,174 --> 00:00:26,007
that's fine.

14
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:27,995
All this trades on is brand, and that

15
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:30,196
has everybody confused.

16
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,613
(rock music)

17
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:39,713
(gentle guitar music)

18
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:17,714
(voices in background)

19
00:01:18,622 --> 00:01:20,780
Because voice is gonna be
the next thing you'll see,

20
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,253
you'll look back at this, so
I'm very good at anticipating

21
00:01:23,253 --> 00:01:26,767
what consumers are gonna
do, before they do it.

22
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:28,169
- And that has been my calling card,

23
00:01:28,169 --> 00:01:31,554
and I've built a very large
wine business, uh, curren-

24
00:01:31,554 --> 00:01:34,293
- As far as 2005, when
you decided to go massive

25
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:35,326
on Youtube,
- Yes.

26
00:01:35,326 --> 00:01:37,244
- where nobody was expecting that

27
00:01:37,244 --> 00:01:39,389
- February 2006, I started a Youtube show

28
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:41,471
that was longer than ten minute video,

29
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:43,436
and I was one of a handful of videos

30
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,134
on Youtube,
- Really?

31
00:01:45,134 --> 00:01:47,459
- that even made a video
longer than ten minutes.

32
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:49,085
It was all pirated content.

33
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:51,025
- It was all, you know, yeah, I've just

34
00:01:51,025 --> 00:01:52,408
done a lot of things early.

35
00:01:52,408 --> 00:01:54,243
Having somebody follow me around on film.

36
00:01:54,243 --> 00:01:55,276
This is now two,
- Tyler!

37
00:01:55,276 --> 00:01:57,060
- Tyler Babin in the house.
- Babin, Babin French.

38
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,562
- Babin is in the house. (laughs)

39
00:01:58,562 --> 00:02:01,936
Uh, you know, we're two years,
we're over two years in.

40
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:04,338
- I'm, I'm, um, I've
gotta, you know, I'm not a

41
00:02:04,338 --> 00:02:06,684
first vlogger, like Casey and others,

42
00:02:06,684 --> 00:02:08,217
um, but I'm the first of us

43
00:02:08,217 --> 00:02:10,347
like uh, of uh vlogging
in a different way,

44
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:12,813
and so, just always doing things,

45
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:15,024
and, and because of that,
having a lot of things not work.

46
00:02:15,024 --> 00:02:17,774
Social cam, or, or, you know, um,

47
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,986
audio, video email is
something I tried to do

48
00:02:21,986 --> 00:02:23,544
a long time ago, every, y'know...

49
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:24,544
- I never heard about that one.

50
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:25,845
- And then nobody ever did, you know,

51
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,547
like there's, and and Yobongo

52
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,351
and a lot of investments
that didn't work out.

53
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:32,712
Alpha Booze didn't, and so, you know,

54
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:35,153
you make a lot of mistakes,
the thing is though,

55
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:37,493
when you're uh, when you're a risk taker,

56
00:02:37,493 --> 00:02:38,877
by other people's point of view,

57
00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:39,747
I don't think I'm a risk taker,

58
00:02:39,747 --> 00:02:40,580
I'm an immigrant.

59
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,413
- Really?
- Yeah.

60
00:02:41,413 --> 00:02:44,162
I take risks I can afford to lose.

61
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:46,618
- So I'm, you know, I'll
never be out of business,

62
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:49,275
because I'll never waste
my last million dollars.

63
00:02:49,275 --> 00:02:50,759
You know, if I lose
everything, I'll take that

64
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,406
and be like, okay, gotta change
my lifestyle a little bit,

65
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:56,225
gotta slow down, which is fine,
most people will never have,

66
00:02:56,225 --> 00:02:58,342
a million, earn a million
dollars, let alone have it.

67
00:02:58,342 --> 00:02:59,559
- That's true
- So, I keep things

68
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:01,018
in perspective, I came from nothing,

69
00:03:01,018 --> 00:03:03,324
I lived in a studio apartment, probably

70
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:06,416
about the size of this small
room we're in right now,

71
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,040
with eight family members.

72
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,987
What's weird is I'm not scared to go back.

73
00:03:09,987 --> 00:03:13,160
I love when people debate
the ROI of this stuff.

74
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,622
If you don't know how to use it,

75
00:03:15,622 --> 00:03:16,955
the ROI is zero.

76
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:22,717
So, first thing's first, if you
believe anything I'm saying,

77
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:25,261
there's an incredible website,
I'll spell it out for you.

78
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:29,759
It goes by the tune of G-O-O-G-L-E.

79
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,855
It will answer anything that
you're thinking right now

80
00:03:32,855 --> 00:03:34,511
that isn't detailed.

81
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:36,252
'Cause I'm giving you the framework.

82
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:39,902
How do I place a Facebook
ad to sell a car?

83
00:03:39,902 --> 00:03:40,735
Enter.

84
00:03:40,735 --> 00:03:43,579
(laughter)

85
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:45,954
You can spend two hours, and by the way,

86
00:03:45,954 --> 00:03:49,120
if you own your own business,
and you do not spend

87
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,190
the thirty hours to educate yourself that,

88
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,138
on what I'm talking
about, you deserve to deal

89
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:56,999
with the ramifications of
what I'm talking about.

90
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,269
This is not, I'm gonna outsource this.

91
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:01,226
I don't want somebody sitting
at table four right there

92
00:04:01,226 --> 00:04:02,461
and saying, "You know
what, he might be right,

93
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:04,678
I'm gonna finally listen to my niece

94
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,742
and I'm gonna let her, she's
22, she gets this shit."

95
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:09,968
She doesn't get shit!

96
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:12,024
She uses it to live her life.

97
00:04:12,024 --> 00:04:15,544
She doesn't use Instagram
to sell fuckin' cars.

98
00:04:15,544 --> 00:04:18,723
You need to be the person
that understands this.

99
00:04:18,723 --> 00:04:22,320
What's funny, I uh, I do a
vlog, and when I got offstage,

100
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,592
Tyler and I were talking, I'm like,

101
00:04:23,592 --> 00:04:25,227
you need to email the
team, I felt like that

102
00:04:25,227 --> 00:04:26,949
was one of the strongest
talks I've ever given

103
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:29,326
to the car industry,
and we need to make sure

104
00:04:29,326 --> 00:04:30,896
we put out pieces of this on Facebook,

105
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,484
and all the stuff I was talking about,

106
00:04:32,484 --> 00:04:36,110
I'm about to do to build
awareness and brand.

107
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,494
Um, I'm just desperate
that somebody in that room,

108
00:04:39,494 --> 00:04:42,741
or, somebody behind that camera, uh,

109
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,634
does something about
what I'm talking about.

110
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:47,650
I will be historically
correct on these issues.

111
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,765
I have no dog in the race,
if anybody does do anything.

112
00:04:50,765 --> 00:04:53,198
I just want them to
'cause it's gonna happen.

113
00:04:53,198 --> 00:04:55,345
- One of the things I, uh, part of my job,

114
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:56,660
I talk with dealers and things like that

115
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,493
all the time,
- Yes.

116
00:04:57,493 --> 00:04:58,570
- one of the things that really resonated

117
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,206
with you're, with what you're saying was,

118
00:05:00,206 --> 00:05:01,326
you know, there's kind of this hesitation,

119
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:03,875
this uh, kind of naivete a little bit,

120
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,134
about where things are headed, um,

121
00:05:06,134 --> 00:05:07,488
I guess, where do you
think that comes from,

122
00:05:07,488 --> 00:05:09,223
generally speaking, uh...

123
00:05:09,223 --> 00:05:11,135
I guess, why are we conditioned that -

124
00:05:11,135 --> 00:05:13,794
- I, I, I think humans, get complacive.

125
00:05:13,794 --> 00:05:14,862
- I think a lot of people, you know,

126
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:16,363
so a lot of, so you've got people,

127
00:05:16,363 --> 00:05:20,912
some people are just, uh,
have losing business DNA.

128
00:05:20,912 --> 00:05:22,293
It's a tough word to use, but like,

129
00:05:22,293 --> 00:05:25,105
they're pessimists, they're complaining,

130
00:05:25,105 --> 00:05:27,070
they're, they're looking for the negative.

131
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,268
And in general that's
just one of the reasons,

132
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:30,775
so that's a group.

133
00:05:30,775 --> 00:05:32,549
The more interesting group,
and the one that I'm always,

134
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:34,724
'cause I don't think I
can turn that person,

135
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:35,741
I've tried for 30 years.

136
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:37,196
That doesn't turn.

137
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:40,939
Here's who turns: the one
that worked really hard

138
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:44,652
for 20 years, got there,
maybe had a divorce

139
00:05:44,652 --> 00:05:46,421
because of it, lost his family,

140
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:47,970
like a million real things.

141
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,586
Or, even better, has a good family,

142
00:05:50,586 --> 00:05:53,679
uh, my dad has this, has
a family that loves him,

143
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:54,991
but has real regret that he didn't

144
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:57,797
go to a single one of my
Little League games, right?

145
00:05:57,797 --> 00:06:00,701
And he's just, and now he's
like, wants to reconcile,

146
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:02,178
and like take more vacations,

147
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:04,070
or get more conservative.

148
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,861
The problem is, if you're
still running a business,

149
00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:07,562
you're on the playing field.

150
00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:08,542
You know, sports.

151
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:11,292
Nobody cares if you're washed up.

152
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:13,406
I always use hockey references when I can,

153
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:16,388
I just need it, nobody
cried for Wayne Gretzky

154
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:18,360
that last season.

155
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,333
That wasn't the job of
the other players, right?

156
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,166
- Right.

157
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,671
- That's the bigger one.

158
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:25,387
They've worked hard, they've won,

159
00:06:25,387 --> 00:06:27,734
they can't, they haven't won
at a level that allows them

160
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:29,633
to totally retire and da da da,

161
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:30,721
they're probably better off to

162
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:33,038
sell their business right now,

163
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:34,921
because it's still at its peak value,

164
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:36,995
um, compared to where it
will be in three years,

165
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:40,314
if they have now chosen
to completely disregard,

166
00:06:40,314 --> 00:06:41,314
um, the end.

167
00:06:42,371 --> 00:06:44,287
It's really that simple, man.

168
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:45,826
You know, it's people that
are not on the offense,

169
00:06:45,826 --> 00:06:47,080
either because they've never been

170
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,135
and they got some level of micro success

171
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:50,756
through sheer will, luck, serendipity,

172
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:53,131
and a million other things, or,

173
00:06:53,131 --> 00:06:55,385
or, and it's not luck,
you know, they they they,

174
00:06:55,385 --> 00:06:59,071
it was there, or, um,
they're the second one,

175
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,379
which is super interesting, man.

176
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,869
They really did it, they just
don't wanna do it anymore.

177
00:07:03,869 --> 00:07:05,738
But they think, they think in business

178
00:07:05,738 --> 00:07:07,512
it's not like sports, and
I think it's like sports.

179
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:09,575
- Yeah, yeah and -

180
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:10,737
- If you're on the field, somebody's gonna

181
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:11,903
knock you the hell out.

182
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:14,104
It's like, you know what,
I'm gonna start using boxing.

183
00:07:14,104 --> 00:07:16,294
Mike Tyson, Joe Lewis, right?

184
00:07:16,294 --> 00:07:18,321
Larry Holmes, Muhammad Ali.

185
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:21,508
Muhammad Ali lost to Trevor
Berbick in his last fight.

186
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:26,165
It wasn't Trevor Berbick's
job to let Muhammad Ali win.

187
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:27,787
Business is sports.

188
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:31,342
If you have a business,
somebody's tryin' to put you out.

189
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:33,856
And they don't care that
you've worked hard for 30 years

190
00:07:33,856 --> 00:07:35,468
and that you're a legend.

191
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:37,715
You're still on the playing,
sell your fuckin' business.

192
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:39,767
Retire, if you wanna be out.

193
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:41,500
But if you're, that's why, man.

194
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,163
They're like, I don't
wanna learn Facebook.

195
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,405
Like, I don't, like I
don't understand this,

196
00:07:45,405 --> 00:07:46,385
I'm not gonna spend ten thousand dollars

197
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:48,100
on something I don't know.

198
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,497
I'll just keep spending it on radio,

199
00:07:49,497 --> 00:07:50,840
I know that.

200
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,585
Or if I stop doing radio, the business

201
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:54,714
will decline even more.

202
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:57,299
And they don't realize
it's the, it's like a,

203
00:07:57,299 --> 00:07:59,865
you know, it's like being an alcoholic.

204
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:02,173
You don't realize it's stop
drinking that fixes it.

205
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:04,245
When you're in the alcoholic mindset,

206
00:08:04,245 --> 00:08:07,048
it's you can't stop drinking,
or it will get worse.

207
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:09,199
No no no no, no no no.

208
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,244
And they're stuck on a drug
that doesn't exist anymore,

209
00:08:11,244 --> 00:08:13,978
which is bad marketing and
operating and business behavior

210
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:16,073
that doesn't exist in the 2018 world.

211
00:08:16,073 --> 00:08:17,814
I'm gonna say it, I wanna
make sure you understand it:

212
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:20,763
Nintendo was a playing card company.

213
00:08:20,763 --> 00:08:23,415
Nintendo started as a
playing card company.

214
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:26,789
I started off as a wine merchant.

215
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:28,517
Like, I get it.

216
00:08:28,517 --> 00:08:30,532
But I actually usually
think the number one move

217
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:33,865
when shit is interesting, is to leverage

218
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,204
while you've got it, the
building of the other thing,

219
00:08:38,205 --> 00:08:39,710
with the assumption that the first thing

220
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,118
might not even be there at all,

221
00:08:41,118 --> 00:08:43,868
and then taking it all as upside.

222
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,908
And then you can get smart, right?

223
00:08:46,908 --> 00:08:49,574
Like, so the way to get smart,
the orange is kind of silly.

224
00:08:49,574 --> 00:08:52,003
Lawnmower is a little bit closer.

225
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:54,421
But what about, why can't you guys start

226
00:08:54,421 --> 00:08:58,063
the coolest air refreshment
thing in a car company,

227
00:08:58,063 --> 00:08:59,906
out of your little one stop?

228
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,509
Like why couldn't somebody here create

229
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:05,412
the ten dollar premium air refresher,

230
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,024
you know, I just think
of it as like, like,

231
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:07,882
I don't know if people, you know, like,

232
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:08,852
why not?

233
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:09,685
You could.

234
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:12,787
And you'd have pretty much
as much permission to do it

235
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:14,120
as anybody else.

236
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,532
I'll go, I'll go a
different place with you.

237
00:09:17,532 --> 00:09:20,851
I think that BMW and Porsche and Mercedes

238
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:24,355
should be going into other sectors.

239
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,400
I'll go the reverse.

240
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,971
I think if I'm at
Mercedes and I'm the CEO,

241
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:30,328
I would be creating an Alexa, Google Home,

242
00:09:30,328 --> 00:09:32,985
Apple Homepod competitor,
because I have permission,

243
00:09:32,985 --> 00:09:35,746
because of my brand, to
be behind engineering

244
00:09:35,746 --> 00:09:37,237
and high-quality product.

245
00:09:37,237 --> 00:09:41,545
I would, why should Braun be
the biggest razor in the world?

246
00:09:41,545 --> 00:09:44,045
Like, I would buy BMW's razor.

247
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,146
So, you know, you gotta think about

248
00:09:48,146 --> 00:09:51,337
where you have permission to hedge.

249
00:09:51,337 --> 00:09:53,191
Thanks for havin' me, it was
really nice meeting you guys.

250
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:54,024
Yeah, have a good day.

251
00:09:54,024 --> 00:09:56,222
Take care, buh bye.

252
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:58,067
Alright, big night for D-Rock,

253
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:00,650
Babin fucked up and uh, and so,

254
00:10:02,562 --> 00:10:04,431
you know, we don't have that much footage.

255
00:10:04,431 --> 00:10:06,931
(piano music)

256
00:10:14,262 --> 00:10:15,621
Hey guys, taking this off right now,

257
00:10:15,621 --> 00:10:17,650
Tyler screwed up, D-Rock you're da best,

258
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,138
uh, he didn't put me out in time,

259
00:10:19,138 --> 00:10:20,377
we're probably gonna miss this flight,

260
00:10:20,377 --> 00:10:22,294
let's see what happens.

261
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:27,024
Babin didn't make it.

262
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,002
Tyler Babin messed up.

263
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:30,907
He didn't make the flight.

264
00:10:30,907 --> 00:10:32,784
I'll see you in Chicago later.

265
00:10:32,784 --> 00:10:34,310
D-Rock 'em.

266
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,354
- Alright, I fucked up.

267
00:10:35,354 --> 00:10:40,048
I didn't have my boarding
pass going into the airport,

268
00:10:40,048 --> 00:10:43,381
and something happened with my check-in.

269
00:10:45,597 --> 00:10:48,212
It looks like Gary's
gonna make this flight.

270
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:50,641
But now, I have about an hour and a half

271
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:53,129
until the next flight to Chicago.

272
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:53,962
Fu-

273
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,983
(gentle music)

274
00:11:03,092 --> 00:11:05,039
We're here in Chicago, Toronto was good,

275
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,403
some really good interviews,

276
00:11:06,403 --> 00:11:08,107
hopefully you'll be able to chop that up,

277
00:11:08,107 --> 00:11:09,429
but Babin missed the flight,

278
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:11,737
and that's the key to the episode.

279
00:11:11,737 --> 00:00:00,000
(rock music)
