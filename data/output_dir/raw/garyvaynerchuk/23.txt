1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,983
- Let's talk and

2
00:00:00,983 --> 00:00:03,550
- Yeah we'll see what happens.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,050
- See the whole point of the podcast is

4
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,370
the moment in life where
everything changes.

5
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,203
- Yes.

6
00:00:08,203 --> 00:00:10,370
- Did you ever think to yourself,

7
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,670
when you were just a little kid,

8
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,553
you know what?

9
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:15,210
When I get older, I'm gonna be this

10
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,090
internationally renowned,
inspirational figure

11
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,715
that's gonna really put
a dent in the universe?

12
00:00:20,715 --> 00:00:23,200
(reflective piano music)

13
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,720
- [Gary V] I just really
believe in my thesis.

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,560
I think everybody here under 30

15
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,590
is rushing to do stuff
to close insecurities

16
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,930
and vulnerabilities, and
it's making them do things

17
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,770
that they're gonna regret long term.

18
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,603
And I just didn't!

19
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:38,436
I just,

20
00:00:38,436 --> 00:00:40,330
you know what it feels
like to be 27 years old,

21
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,270
and see your college friends and

22
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,140
them making jokes that
you work in your dad's

23
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:44,980
liquor store?

24
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:48,850
I just, was able to be in my own head and

25
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,850
not care what anybody else thought.

26
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,201
And that would be my
biggest piece of advice

27
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:54,200
because I genuinely believe all of you

28
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,160
are in a rush for that.

29
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,920
I don't think you care
about a BMW or a Rolex

30
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,810
or spending a lot of money on a vacation,

31
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,630
for any other reason because of the

32
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,760
psychological aspects of
how that positions you

33
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,960
to other people.

34
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,360
I really believe that, and so

35
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,625
I just think people,

36
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,470
the young man, I don't know if he's here,

37
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,670
who's like, I'm killing it.

38
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,030
I want to start teaching other people,

39
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,209
he's so young.

40
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:20,270
Anybody could do well at Wall
Street the last six years.

41
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,103
Everybody.

42
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:23,550
I definitely thought I was different

43
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,140
at an extremely young age.

44
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:28,620
I grew up in a world that

45
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,190
didn't reward outwardly the
things that I was about.

46
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,440
It still blows my mind
that I was 15, 16 years old

47
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,534
making real money in my side businesses

48
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:41,710
and every teacher I had
and every friend's parent

49
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,260
thought I was gonna be a loser.

50
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,540
Man, I know we're

51
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,040
we're locking in a show with
him or a session, right?

52
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,900
A meeting?

53
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,980
Jonathan, man, keep fuckin' grinding, man.

54
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,343
All that attention on you.

55
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:55,176
(high pitched tone)

56
00:01:55,176 --> 00:01:58,106
The food is just your passion.

57
00:01:58,106 --> 00:02:00,020
- [Man] Sonar, sensors?

58
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,050
- This is killing my

59
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,890
killing my vibe.

60
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,943
Just, I'd rather you actually hit the car!

61
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:09,959
(laughs)
At this point.

62
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
Just fuckin' hit it.

63
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,898
Anyway, guys, who's reading "Crushing It"?

64
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:18,220
The audio's good, I'm halfway done.

65
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,112
When am I finishing it, next week?

66
00:02:20,112 --> 00:02:21,130
(high pitched tone continues)

67
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,766
Alright there's something broken now.

68
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:25,298
Yeah, blang that.

69
00:02:25,298 --> 00:02:28,179
(hip hop music)

70
00:02:28,179 --> 00:02:30,359
(high pitched tone starts again)

71
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,060
This fuckin' display.

72
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,920
I want all new Gunna.

73
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,970
I want all new Gunna.

74
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,140
This is absurd.

75
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,750
- [Man] I turned it off too, look.

76
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,230
- I don't believe you.

77
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,210
Look for something else.

78
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,320
Look at that rear button.

79
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,080
What's that rear button that's lit up?

80
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,750
That's rear, that's down below?

81
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,572
- Yep, yep, yep.

82
00:02:50,572 --> 00:02:51,989
Right there, yep.

83
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:54,041
- Now we're freezing!

84
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:54,874
(laughs)

85
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:55,707
- Turn that back on.

86
00:02:55,707 --> 00:02:56,930
Turn up the car.

87
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,120
- No, there's snow probably.

88
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,030
- [Gary V] Get outta the car and wipe the

89
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,700
I'm gonna fucking wipe the snow.

90
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,600
Let me outta here.

91
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,538
Oh shit, it's green.

92
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:10,140
I do have to do it,

93
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,710
gotta entertain these people!

94
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,860
I'm trying to entertain
these people, A.J.!

95
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,940
I gotta bounce tomorrow morning,

96
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,977
'cause I can't watch the
fuckin' Patriots playing a game.

97
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:18,810
(laughs)

98
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:19,928
But other than that, it's
been good, how about you?

99
00:03:19,928 --> 00:03:20,761
What up, man?

100
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:21,594
- Nice to meet you.
- How are you, man?

101
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:22,427
Real pleasure.

102
00:03:22,427 --> 00:03:23,260
Real pleasure.

103
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,093
Hey, Greg!

104
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:24,926
- [Greg] Hey how are you doing?

105
00:03:24,926 --> 00:03:25,759
- [Gary V] How are you, man?

106
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,592
Such a pleasure, how are things?

107
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,425
- Cold.

108
00:03:27,425 --> 00:03:28,950
- It is fucking cold.

109
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,840
Wanna bring some chairs over?

110
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,752
- Yeah.

111
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:32,720
- There's so much.

112
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,920
- Tre's like the next generation, right?

113
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,293
- So much.

114
00:03:35,293 --> 00:03:36,954
- Tre's livestreaming 2K on Twitch

115
00:03:36,954 --> 00:03:38,547
and I mean

116
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:39,380
- They know,

117
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,964
'cause they're

118
00:03:41,964 --> 00:03:43,712
and there's so much
money they're leaving on

119
00:03:43,712 --> 00:03:46,120
so much money, happiness.

120
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,510
Yeah man, it's gonna be
real interesting to watch.

121
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,759
It's coming.

122
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,920
I'm talkin' about like

123
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,540
I mean,

124
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,760
if governments can be folded by this,

125
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,760
leagues could be folded by this.

126
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,930
This is way bigger.

127
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,220
It may not even hit his generation,

128
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,150
it might be

129
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,160
you got anybody younger than you?

130
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,350
If they had like a nine year old brother,

131
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,680
that kid, legitimately

132
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,760
could live in a world where

133
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,530
I just think the internet
kills everything in the middle.

134
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,440
And so,

135
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,970
what happened to
bookstores and happened to

136
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,730
limo services

137
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,417
that shit can happen to the fuckin' NBA.

138
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:25,600
Right?

139
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,080
Nobody gives a fuck about Steph Curry.

140
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,110
They care about his attention.

141
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,943
They don't give a fuck if you can

142
00:04:30,943 --> 00:04:32,420
shoot from 40 feet out.

143
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,950
Or score 60 a night.

144
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,890
They care that kids are
influenced by what you say.

145
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,150
And whether you're fuckin' Meek Mill

146
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,890
or fuckin' LeBron,

147
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,470
or fuckin' CNN it's all the same shit!

148
00:04:45,363 --> 00:04:47,860
It's understanding the strength of

149
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,800
if you love Twitch, you
go all in on Twitch.

150
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,810
If you love fashion, you
go all in on fashion.

151
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,650
Because every athlete
wants to be a rapper,

152
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,860
every rapper wants to be an athlete,

153
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,240
and they all want to be entrepreneurs.

154
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,390
That's real.

155
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,334
Right?

156
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:03,858
- Entrepreneurs are the new rock stars!

157
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:05,217
- 100 percent.

158
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:06,099
- Look at,

159
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:07,051
who do kids want to be?

160
00:05:07,051 --> 00:05:09,190
It used to be they wanted to be that guy.

161
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,511
Now they want to be

162
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:11,344
Mark Zuckerberg
- You know why?

163
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,350
You know why they want to be me?

164
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,170
'Cause they can!

165
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,570
You need to be born blessed out your ass

166
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,403
to be him or

167
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,740
Robin our football player,

168
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,398
he's a fuckin' house!

169
00:05:23,398 --> 00:05:24,270
(laughs)

170
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,040
He's all of us in one man!

171
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,410
With no body fat!

172
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,770
Did you see him take off his shirt?

173
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,410
Did you see that shit?

174
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,220
So that's why, 'cause it's actually true.

175
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,400
I want to be like Mike?

176
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,590
Fuck that.

177
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,710
This sneaker, you can actually be that.

178
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,669
I'll give you it right now!

179
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:46,455
Go on Craigslist, take all the free shit

180
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:48,800
that they're offering on the free page

181
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,930
in the classifieds,

182
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,760
bring it home, take a picture,

183
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,300
put it on Facebook Marketplace,

184
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,870
and make $400 a week.

185
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,230
Yo, just sell shit!

186
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,017
Like in about a month, he's
not gonna think that shirt

187
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:00,434
is as good as he think it's,
you know how that works.

188
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:01,790
- Right.

189
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,623
- Fashion.

190
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:05,210
So instead of letting it be in your house

191
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,900
while you're at Duke, take
a picture and sell it!

192
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:11,960
Fuckin'

193
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,944
the Craigslist thing is crazy.

194
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:16,470
Literally anybody on welfare

195
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,940
I think could become wealthy

196
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,160
just by having a phone and

197
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,120
you could have a studio,

198
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,930
you go to the person's house,

199
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,879
everybody's got a bullshit car

200
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:28,170
carry this shit on the bus!

201
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,390
If you're broke, grab this,

202
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,990
go on the bus, sit on the bus like this

203
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,320
everybody's gonna look at you,

204
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,140
be like yeah, yeah, yeah keep laughing.

205
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,090
Come home,

206
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,590
take a picture,

207
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,990
and fuckin' post it on
Facebook Marketplace!

208
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,890
15 bucks,

209
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,410
somebody's like, yo, I'll take your table.

210
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,243
Ding dong!

211
00:06:45,243 --> 00:06:46,076
Yo, hello.

212
00:06:46,076 --> 00:06:48,800
Here you go, sold!

213
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,780
You just wait

214
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,630
What are you doing with

215
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,590
and then somebody's gonna say,

216
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,520
but damn.

217
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,845
It's gonna take 40 minutes to go there,

218
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:56,150
40 minutes to take on the bus,

219
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,430
five minutes to post,

220
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,263
seven minutes

221
00:06:58,263 --> 00:06:59,096
I'm gonna be like,

222
00:06:59,096 --> 00:07:00,480
well what are you doing
with your time anyway?

223
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,560
Everybody can win,

224
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,090
it's about being yourself.

225
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,870
The truth is the fuckin' formula.

226
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,314
That's the strategy.

227
00:07:06,314 --> 00:07:07,147
Know what I mean?

228
00:07:07,147 --> 00:07:08,730
- Yeah, I feel you.

229
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,940
- In fuckin',

230
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,310
I'm telling you right now.

231
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,030
That's literally $35
on Facebook Marketplace

232
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,320
if you just pick it up.

233
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,110
It's seven minutes of your time.

234
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,422
It's 15 minutes of your time.

235
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:31,422
♪ ("Full Clip" by Gang Starr) ♪

236
00:07:31,942 --> 00:07:33,260
Turn of the music.

237
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,270
Turn off the music,

238
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,010
honestly, I think I just eliminated

239
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,049
for the first time

240
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:38,960
(high-pitched tone)

241
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,040
I just eliminated for the
first time in my career

242
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,410
the excuse of no money.

243
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,730
I think it just happened.

244
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,870
This is like a big day for me.

245
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,340
Literally for 30 years, I've had to like,

246
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,390
pander to that excuse.

247
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,223
It's over.

248
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,490
It's actually over.

249
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,420
It's called Craigslist free section.

250
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,050
I was about to say buy it,

251
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,660
go take it, for free,

252
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,260
'cause most people just
want you to pick it up.

253
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,910
'Cause it's big or what have you.

254
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,820
If you happen to actually have a truck,

255
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,224
like a bigger vehicle,

256
00:08:08,224 --> 00:08:10,670
than you are really set!

257
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,000
My friends, Craigslist Free

258
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,330
to then relist it on Facebook Marketplace,

259
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,040
the arbitrage of the internet.

260
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,280
We see this in retail where
people buy things in China,

261
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,230
post on Amazon, things of that nature,

262
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,688
buy on marshalls.com, sell on Amazon,

263
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:25,330
it happens.

264
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,870
The much more humble version

265
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,870
when you've got nothing,

266
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,820
if you're just sitting like I need money,

267
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,653
all those people that were like,

268
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:33,010
yo can somebody buy me Gary V's book,

269
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:33,842
I can't afford it.

270
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:37,019
That means $17 dollars,

271
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,679
it's there man,

272
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,529
I really think a real hustler

273
00:08:43,972 --> 00:08:46,280
a hundred bucks, five times a day

274
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,680
I think it's like $300 a week.

275
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,660
- [Man] That's like
full time though, right?

276
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,720
- Nah,

277
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,610
I feel like people,

278
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,970
I think $300 bucks a week,

279
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,100
if you're not even doing it full time

280
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,540
I think if you take your 6pm to 9pm

281
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,860
Monday and Tuesday, picking up shit,

282
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,840
and then reposting it
on Facebook Marketplace

283
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,190
and then meeting people on Saturday

284
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,560
to come to your home and grab it,

285
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,400
I think it's $300 a week, man.

286
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,449
I think it could be even bigger.

287
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:14,365
Why are we still lost?

288
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:16,030
This is it?

289
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:18,979
(laughs)

290
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,670
When's he going?

291
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,503
How?

292
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,340
A lot of attractive people in here!

293
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,173
- Wow
- A lot of

294
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:39,140
attractive people in here.

295
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,740
- Right here, he just walked in!

296
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:48,834
(hip hop music)

297
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,587
- [Man] Gary V!

298
00:09:51,587 --> 00:09:52,782
- Oh you live?

299
00:09:52,782 --> 00:09:53,618
(laughs)

300
00:09:53,618 --> 00:09:55,917
Oh we're up to a whole lot!

301
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:56,750
(laughs)

302
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,583
Cameras everywhere.

303
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,910
Fucking cameras everywhere.

304
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,760
Alright let's go.

305
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,353
Oh, shit.

306
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,213
I go, what's going on?

307
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,210
They know about it and they're against it?

308
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,850
The O.R. team, the P.R. team.

309
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,950
Who's P.R.?

310
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,490
Hmm.

311
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,110
Should we meet in the parking lot?

312
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,590
Can you scour my Twitter and

313
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,400
can you look at all my

314
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,820
Baban, can you do that too actually,

315
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,210
can you look at all the tweets, replies?

316
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,831
So we're trying to do a meetup.

317
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:36,870
'Cause I have to be at Mall of America,

318
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,130
so I figured I'd be like, hey,

319
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,860
I can meet you there real quick.

320
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,970
I didn't want to disrupt it in any way.

321
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,930
But it seems like security
is not excited about it

322
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,010
or something, I don't
know the details yet.

323
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,519
I figured with all the
football players there

324
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,700
big crowds, you know?

325
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,290
So, we're on our way there.

326
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,380
It's snowing.

327
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,450
Trying to figure it out.

328
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,560
Got to move it to the IHOP.

329
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,840
What do you think?

330
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:03,400
- I think as soon we walk
in, we're kicked out.

331
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,233
- I bet you,

332
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:05,066
they know who I am,

333
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:07,070
I've interacted with the Mall of America

334
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:07,903
Twitter account.

335
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,251
They're gonna be, hello
sir, you're outta here!

336
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:12,540
Yeah, fuck that.

337
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,390
We're gonna lose.

338
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,750
- Just in the parking lot of IHOP.

339
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,400
- Snapchat, I'm moving the meetup.

340
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,286
I'm gonna move it to the IHOP on Killebrew

341
00:11:22,286 --> 00:11:24,240
I'm just not gonna be
able to pull this off

342
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,320
at the Mall of America.

343
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,140
I just feel like they're
gonna kick me out.

344
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,590
Should I buy a thousand
dollars worth of pancakes

345
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,473
so they let us all in?

346
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:34,598
(high pitched tone)

347
00:11:34,598 --> 00:11:35,431
Really?

348
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,630
Holy shit.

349
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,175
They think I'm in that bus!

350
00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:46,070
(laughs)
Go straight go straight

351
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,440
go straight go straight.

352
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,770
I want to go away from

353
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,630
pull in right here, yeah, right here.

354
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,463
Yep.

355
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,283
Watch this.

356
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,366
(laughs)

357
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,100
You get out first, Baban.

358
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:04,511
We should be like, hey!

359
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:07,666
Yo!

360
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,499
- [Fan] There he is!

361
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:10,750
(crowd cheering)

362
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,020
- Don't slip, don't slip!

363
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,919
- Gary motherfuckin' dude
- What up man?

364
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,080
- How are you doing?
- Good brother, how are you?

365
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,460
- Oh my God, it's such
a pleasure to meet you.

366
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,830
- Nice to meet you,
I'm sorry it's so cold!

367
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,850
- Gary, nice to meet you.
- What up, man?

368
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,683
How are you?

369
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:22,779
- Don't be sorry, we live here man!

370
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:23,928
- [Gary] Yeah you guys know!

371
00:12:23,928 --> 00:12:24,927
What's up, man!

372
00:12:24,927 --> 00:12:26,160
- Hey nice to meet you.

373
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,010
- Good to see you again, man.

374
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,280
There's a lot of people
listening who don't know

375
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,610
who I am and so it's
tough to come out the gate

376
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,579
after you said such a nice thing

377
00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:33,700
to say, yes I knew.

378
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,680
But I, for example,

379
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,628
actually let's do this backwards.

380
00:12:37,628 --> 00:12:41,520
I really think it's an
extremely small fraction

381
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,010
of the actual way it all plays out,

382
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,550
right this minute.

383
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,383
- [Interviewer] 'kay.

384
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:48,050
- [Gary V] So I think we
sit here 27 years from now,

385
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,010
and it starts getting really weird.

386
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:50,843
- [Interviewer] Like really weird.

387
00:12:50,843 --> 00:12:51,676
- [Gary V] Like really weird.

388
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:52,620
- [Interviewer] In terms of the reach

389
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,210
- [Gary] I think everybody
will know who I am.

390
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,043
- [Interviewer] Right.
- [Gary] And I think I'm going

391
00:12:55,043 --> 00:12:56,500
to have a real positive impact.

392
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,108
- [Fan] Someone selling a TV for $20 bucks

393
00:12:58,108 --> 00:13:00,150
immediately posted it,

394
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,079
found like 50 people,
sold it for $200 bucks.

395
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,274
- That's my guy!

396
00:13:03,274 --> 00:13:04,180
The flip, baby!

397
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,430
- I appreciate it.
- The flip, let's go.

398
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,520
- Could you take a picture of us?

399
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,353
- Let's do it.

400
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,249
- Awesome.

401
00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:09,082
- [Gary] I will not forget this.

402
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:09,915
- I just want to give something

403
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:10,748
you totally changed my life.

404
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,622
I know you get off on hearing that,

405
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:12,992
and I just, I mean that
from the bottom of my heart.

406
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:13,825
- Thank you, brother.

407
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:14,780
- One last thing that's kinda fucked up,

408
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,840
could you sign my shoe?

409
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,673
- Yes.

410
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:18,270
- I have no Crushing It for you to sign.

411
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,103
- No worries, brother.

412
00:13:19,103 --> 00:13:20,340
- Can you sign the outside right here?

413
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,173
- Yeah I got you.

414
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:22,006
- Yeah, look at that!

415
00:13:22,006 --> 00:13:22,877
- [Fan] Dude's signing his shoes!

416
00:13:22,877 --> 00:13:24,300
- We're going inside!

417
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,380
Okay the update is, it's fucking cold.

418
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,510
And we're going inside and
I'm gonna keep the line

419
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,343
the way it was.

420
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:34,840
It pull from opposite directions,

421
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,000
most of my success comes from that,

422
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,050
and maybe that double life
I lived during my childhood

423
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,940
'cause I'm not scared of losing,

424
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,120
'cause I was told that I was losing.

425
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,580
- Right, you were gonna lose anyway!

426
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,850
- That's right!

427
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,700
- They were saying, look you're
not gonna amount to anything

428
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,460
anyway, so in your mind, you're thinking,

429
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,610
why not try?
- House money.

430
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,300
House money, and I didn't believe them.

431
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,570
It wasn't even just like,

432
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,000
well if I have nothing to lose,

433
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,870
I was like, you're wrong.

434
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,260
What is making you not jump all in?

435
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,890
Usually, not crazy results
in a short period of time,

436
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,468
which means you're looking for,

437
00:14:09,468 --> 00:14:11,410
you're not looking for marriages,

438
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,230
you're looking for hookups.

439
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,410
That's why you haven't figured it out.

440
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,570
Everybody thinks

441
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,919
everybody is on stuck, this is a great

442
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,580
two themes in a row.

443
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,400
Everybody's stuck on the idea of it.

444
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,040
Guys, it's not the idea of it.

445
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,930
Ways

446
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,530
wasn't a new innovation.

447
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,853
Right?

448
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:36,190
Instagram wasn't a new innovation.

449
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,940
Spotify wasn't a new,

450
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,954
guys, it's like,

451
00:14:38,954 --> 00:14:41,350
it's execution.

452
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,990
So usually people are bouncing
around their businesses,

453
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,050
'cause they think they'll
come up with an idea

454
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,650
it's gonna launch, and
fuckin' nirvana's gonna come.

455
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,620
You know?

456
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,453
It's just not!

457
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:52,010
It's fuckin' execution.

458
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,500
Nothing I've ever done in
my life is some new thing.

459
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,598
I've just done it better, harder, longer

460
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,013
it's just in the edges.

461
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:03,706
Elon Musk is not in this room right now.

462
00:15:03,706 --> 00:15:05,490
You understand?

463
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,610
So you're bouncing around,

464
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,730
'cause you're not
getting the traction that

465
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,850
you're looking for.

466
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,427
Because you're probably
judging way too fast.

467
00:15:11,427 --> 00:15:14,840
VaynerMedia sucked shit the
first two years, me and AJ

468
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,270
had a long debate about selling
it for a million dollars

469
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,740
to Buddy Media, 29 months in.

470
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,310
Yeah, I mean like everybody thinks like

471
00:15:26,244 --> 00:15:30,005
Guys, most people are
not actual entrepreneurs.

472
00:15:30,005 --> 00:15:33,300
We are, as a collective universe,
being tricked that we are.

473
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:36,588
Just keep that in mind.

474
00:15:36,588 --> 00:00:00,000
