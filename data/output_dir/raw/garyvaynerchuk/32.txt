1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,713
- Hey.

2
00:00:01,713 --> 00:00:02,546
(audience laughter)

3
00:00:02,546 --> 00:00:03,379
- [Audience] Hey.

4
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:06,670
- First and foremost, I'm
always flying in and out

5
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:07,970
on these things, so I don't get to see

6
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,610
a ton of presentations,
but I catch a whole bunch

7
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,300
kinda little something here and there.

8
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,380
I just wanna clap up the
last one one more time,

9
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,442
'cause I thought that was phenomenal.

10
00:00:15,442 --> 00:00:17,320
(applause)

11
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,211
I was sitting up there
and I was listening,

12
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:21,370
I'm trying to always maximize work,

13
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,880
so sitting there working,
and all the sessions

14
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,000
were really good, I was actually able

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,070
to get a bunch in today,
which made it fun,

16
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,530
but that was really good, I
was really like feeling it.

17
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,830
And I was like, this is really good,

18
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,920
I was like listening, I was like,

19
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,370
I believe in all that shit, I believe

20
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,040
in every word that you just spit.

21
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,049
But then you got into
the Michael Jordan part.

22
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:40,882
(audience laughter)

23
00:00:40,882 --> 00:00:42,854
And I was like, fuck Jason.

24
00:00:42,854 --> 00:00:44,440
(audience laughter)

25
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,730
'Cause I'm a die-hard Knicks fan

26
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,315
and I fucking hate Michael Jordan.

27
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:49,610
(audience laughter)

28
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,870
Period.

29
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,470
Oh, man, that sucked.

30
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,130
And I'm a Jets fan, I got Tom Brady,

31
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,120
I'm fucking miserable about sports.

32
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,953
Anyway.

33
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:58,883
Look.

34
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:01,790
I wanna really take
advantage of this format.

35
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,099
This is a fairly small
group, and we're really tight

36
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,920
in here, and this is
just like how I love it.

37
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,140
And so, to be very honest,
I'll spit a little bit here,

38
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,600
but I'd love to do a little bit of Q&A.

39
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,240
I'm not sure how set up they are for it,

40
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,510
but I don't even need the mic,
so I'll repeat the questions.

41
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,520
So I think, you know,
the beauty of technology

42
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,400
is that so many of my current thoughts

43
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,860
are on YouTube and Facebook right now,

44
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,710
especially if any of you
have consumed any of it,

45
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,210
I don't need to repeat the themes.

46
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,990
I think they're basic.

47
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,900
I think, at some level,
everybody has touched on it.

48
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,970
You know, I think the thing
that I'm most interested in

49
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,350
is the notion of taking it, right?

50
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,030
To me, the most interesting
thing to me is the Internet.

51
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,560
I think we grossly
underestimate the Internet.

52
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,690
You know, the Internet itself
is ultimately the thing

53
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,460
that gives us an opportunity to solve

54
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,290
the thing that I think is really

55
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,440
in our hearts and we're passionate about.

56
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,650
I associate so much with
so many, because you know,

57
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,110
my story is, I was born in
Belarus, I came to the US

58
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,100
when I was three, I lived
in a studio apartment

59
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,490
the size of the stage I'm on right now

60
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,980
with seven family members.

61
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,240
And so, no matter what you
look like, as we all know,

62
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,699
it's about what you live,
where you come from.

63
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,900
And to be very frank,
I'll be very, I just,

64
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,520
it's interesting, I see this all the time

65
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,410
and I'm empathetic that the
system doesn't put everybody

66
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,270
in the best position to
succeed, but I'm a product

67
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,490
where I think all my struggles have been

68
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,860
my biggest advantage.

69
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,130
And really, I didn't grow
up in an education system

70
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,160
or VC system that rewarded
me for being a white male,

71
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,680
I grew up in a very interesting path,

72
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,510
I was a terrible fucking student,

73
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,220
I was a D and F student,
so like most immigrants,

74
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,110
I didn't use education as my way out,

75
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,780
I was just a kid that sold shit.

76
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,780
Right, like I just sold
flowers and I sold lemonade.

77
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,020
Now, I'm Jewish and I sang
Christmas carols like fucking

78
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,312
it was my last song.

79
00:02:54,312 --> 00:02:56,950
(audience laughter)

80
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,730
What I did, and really, what I would love

81
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,990
to leave you here with, like I know

82
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,210
the real answer 'cause I've seen it

83
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,430
in so many people's eyes,
it's self-awareness.

84
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,940
My biggest fear in this
room is that you're trying

85
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,310
to be somebody because you want to be them

86
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,850
versus you figure yourself out

87
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,320
and put yourself in a
position to be that person.

88
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,180
I think, what you had when I watched

89
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,670
what you were just talking about, like

90
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,370
that kid was that kid from the get.

91
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,360
He was self-aware, he figured himself out.

92
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,840
He was comfortable in
that nerdy environment,

93
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,980
I was comfortable in high
school working every minute,

94
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,270
every second, and missing every party.

95
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,910
And like, I just, I have not
heard a voice in own my head

96
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,620
but mine for a very very very long time.

97
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,830
And I think what is most
interesting to me right now is,

98
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,170
if you really pay attention
to what's happening,

99
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,540
the Internet has absolutely
done this incredible thing,

100
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,870
which is there's nobody who's flawed

101
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,600
that can sit in between
you and the end consumer

102
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,810
who's stopping you besides the
narrative in your own head.

103
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,140
That's a big deal.

104
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,770
Like, you know, obviously, a
lot of people growing up in

105
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,660
the music industry, it's
just so different now.

106
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,370
Like, just fucking go make
it, like producing a song now

107
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,520
with technology and
putting it on SoundCloud,

108
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,250
production and distribution.

109
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,280
Like, that's some shit you
couldn't have even imagined.

110
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,570
And so I just think, I'll be very honest,

111
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,140
I think we're living
through the greatest time

112
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,320
to be a human ever, I do.

113
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,910
We've got problems everywhere,
we got genocide in the world,

114
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,310
we've got nothing but unlimited problems.

115
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,330
But I put things into
perspective, like I don't know.

116
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,090
We got plenty of problems, but
the black plague was worse.

117
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:29,923
Right?

118
00:04:29,923 --> 00:04:32,590
We got plenty of problems,
but World War II was worse.

119
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,840
Like you know, there's just opportunity

120
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,960
because of the Internet,
not because we've evolved,

121
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,310
I don't put this on us.

122
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,510
Like, we've still got plenty of short,

123
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,380
but the fact that we
have so much opportunity.

124
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,850
And so to me, it's basic.

125
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,940
Either you're dwelling
and looking backwards,

126
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,790
or you're optimistic and looking forward.

127
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,100
The problem is, you grow
up in an environment,

128
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,710
you grow up with parents that put you

129
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,200
on the defense or the offense.

130
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,050
And that is really the lottery.

131
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,460
The lottery really is
who's your mom, right.

132
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,150
The lottery is who's your best friend.

133
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,060
That's the lottery I think a lot about.

134
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,620
And so I look at, I have
unlimited white male friends

135
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,100
who have tons of fucking money in the bank

136
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,670
who fucking lost, who
suck, who are in depression

137
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,310
'cause they got the wrong lottery

138
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,710
'cause their mom's broken
'cause her mom was broken

139
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,020
and 'cause her dad was broken.

140
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,550
And so I am the byproduct,
against all the odds that I had,

141
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,530
of parents that fucking dominated.

142
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,040
Like, my mom is all time.

143
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,830
Just all time, she is.

144
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,150
And so, even when I was getting Ds and Fs

145
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,030
and all the other immigrant
families were making fun of her

146
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,110
because her son wasn't gonna make it

147
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,270
'cause you had to get As and Bs

148
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,950
'cause that's all we
knew in the 80s and 90s,

149
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,760
she knew who I was, she
let me hone my skills.

150
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,670
I'd get Ds and Fs, I'd get punished,

151
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,920
but I was still allowed to
go do my baseball card shows

152
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,650
'cause I was building my
skill, building my skill.

153
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,780
And they taught me work.

154
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,070
They taught me work.

155
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,810
I didn't see my dad until I was 15,

156
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,760
and he made me work in his liquor store

157
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,450
even though we slept in
the same house every night,

158
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,750
because he'd left before I
woke up and he came after.

159
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,410
And so we live in this world now

160
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,490
where the fact of the matter is,

161
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,210
your Instagram account,
your YouTube account,

162
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,630
your SoundCloud account, the Internet.

163
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,730
Like, the fact that, let
me tell you something

164
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,870
that fascinates me.

165
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,120
Because we think a lot
about money and opportunity,

166
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,260
let me tell you about an opportunity

167
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,220
that I can't get out of my head.

168
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,780
Which is, there's a
website called Craigslist.

169
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,950
There's a section called
Free where people list shit

170
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,800
that they wanna get rid of.

171
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,900
You go there and you take it.

172
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,690
And then you list it
on Facebook Marketplace

173
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,970
and you sell it.

174
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,210
And when I think about this,
I've been dreaming about this

175
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,910
for the last 72 hours, by the way.

176
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,970
I'm literally doing this
selfishly so (mumbles)

177
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,220
captures this 'cause
this video is going out.

178
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:52,040
You know, it's crazy to
me that the only thing

179
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,200
that stops somebody from winning

180
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,930
is education and the work ethic, right.

181
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,980
I understand that.

182
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,900
But education comes in
so many different forms.

183
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,910
I was on The Breakfast
Club the first time,

184
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,660
and Envy thought I was
a motivational speaker,

185
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,050
like a bullshit rah rah,
kind of like the secret shit.

186
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,000
So he kinda called me
out and I was like fuck.

187
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,141
You know, it was like.

188
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:12,974
(audience laughter)

189
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,000
He's like, you know,
you're lying on the radio,

190
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,270
and he was like, "Give
us something practical,

191
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,110
"fuck this mindset shit,"
right, I'm like okay,

192
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,350
the mindset's the game, but
fuck it, I'll give it you.

193
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,460
And I said, "Go to the dollar
store and go to Marshalls,

194
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,350
"take your phone, scan
shit, look it up on Ebay,

195
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,820
"and if it costs two dollars on Marshalls

196
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,620
"and it's selling for
nine dollars on Ebay,

197
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,260
"buy it and sell it."

198
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,280
And that was, it was
kinda like this moment

199
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,160
in a six minute radio spot.

200
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,950
And then it caught a little,
like, then I read all

201
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,890
the comments, and people
are like bullshit, or yes.

202
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,040
Then I started getting emails like yo,

203
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,550
I make $500 a week, but I'm making 200 now

204
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,800
'cause I'm going to dollar
store and selling it on Ebay.

205
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,510
And it built in this whole thing.

206
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,620
And then I've named it
the 2017 flip challenge.

207
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,760
And we have 10,000 emails of people

208
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,680
who've literally went garage
selling to the thrift store

209
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,500
and the dollar store and
have made 20, 30, 40,000.

210
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,620
I started thinking about the long tail,

211
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,210
the long tail of all this, right.

212
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,440
Like, we're in this, especially
like in this incubator,

213
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,100
like 99% of startups are gonna fail

214
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,670
in this generation because we're living

215
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,660
through the greatest era
of fake entrepreneurship.

216
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,470
The amount of fake entrepreneurs
that are in this building

217
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,274
right now is extraordinary.

218
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:21,370
(audience laughter)

219
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,790
It's true, it's true.

220
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,300
And by the way, please, I know
a lot of you don't know me,

221
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,460
I'm not sitting on a high horse like

222
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,140
I'm a good entrepreneur and you're not.

223
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,600
It's just black and white
obvious 'cause it's a bubble

224
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,010
'cause it got cool, right, it got cool.

225
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:36,270
And it doesn't cost anything,
and there's so much money

226
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,080
in the system, there's so much incubators

227
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,320
willing to give you money.

228
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,620
All my friends for the last 10-15 years

229
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,570
are building all these businesses where

230
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,910
it's really not that hard to
lose money every month, right.

231
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,840
I think on you panel, you guys said,

232
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,110
as entrepreneurs, you know, losing money

233
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,210
and then making money or
building, I couldn't catch

234
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,010
the whole thing 'cause I was distracted.

235
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,090
The problem is, it takes a lot of talent

236
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,320
to build something to then
eventually make money.

237
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,920
And we spend 99% of our time
talking about fucking Slack

238
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,780
and Uber and Snapchat
and fucking Instagram.

239
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,430
We got like 17 companies to talk about and

240
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,410
there's 17 fucking companies
going out of business

241
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,730
every hour, every minute, and meanwhile,

242
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,210
there's more money being
pumped into the system.

243
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,500
And it's just all so obvious right now,

244
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,360
where this is all going,
and it's not very privy

245
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,290
because we're lacking self-awareness.

246
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,980
What we're doing is we're
just riding the waves

247
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,550
of what the current conversation is.

248
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,990
There's so many people that are gonna be

249
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,060
founders of companies who
would've done incredibly well

250
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,560
being number 17 at this startup

251
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,510
or number 94 at that company
or number 167 at that company,

252
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,380
but they wanna be number one
of the Uber of pancakes, right.

253
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,590
And like so, and I'm watching this

254
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,940
and I'm fascinated by it.

255
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,360
Meanwhile, meanwhile,
there's so much practicality.

256
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,010
Let me tell you what breaks my heart.

257
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,830
I read a lot of feedback from my audience.

258
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,900
I've gotten two examples
in the last three weeks

259
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,900
of kids that were making money
on retail arbitrage, right.

260
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,010
So I think, I brought up
already the Craigslist

261
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,030
to Facebook Marketplace.

262
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,520
I think no question,
if you said to me hey,

263
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,010
this is a classroom of 16 year olds and

264
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,570
they have to make money
in the next 24 months

265
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:21,010
or bad, bad stuff happens, I
only default into go buy shit

266
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,630
and sell it and run
the Internet arbitrage.

267
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,570
We'll spend the first three months,

268
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,740
I'll teach you everything
about Craigslist and Ebay

269
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,130
and Facebook Marketplace and Letgo,

270
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,670
and then we'll talk about China

271
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,530
and buying shit there and the arbitrage.

272
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,810
I would spend an enormous amount of time,

273
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,750
because the practicality right now

274
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,380
and the inefficiency of the Internet,

275
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,680
of buying and selling
stuff, is extraordinary.

276
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,550
In the last three weeks,
I've had these kids who,

277
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,590
you know, have been following
my content and are like Gary,

278
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,800
I wanna get your advice.

279
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,150
And basically, both narratives
went the exact same way,

280
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,490
which is hey, I listen to you, I got good,

281
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,180
I started buying stuff, then I hit it big,

282
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,690
a bunch of people made a lot of money

283
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,040
on the solar eclipse glasses.

284
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,480
Like, you could literally buy those things

285
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,640
for like 16 cents in China on Baidu

286
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,050
and then sell it for like
four dollars a pop on Amazon.

287
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:06,883
People made bank.

288
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:09,780
Like, I know one kid who made $317,000.

289
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,830
On a $3,000 starting point, right.

290
00:11:13,827 --> 00:11:16,330
It's very real to me,
instead of I'm gonna build

291
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,630
some crazy app that's gonna
fucking change the world, right.

292
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,650
'Cause it's practical as fuck.

293
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:24,850
And both of them have made real money,

294
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,870
one kid's made like 16,000 this year

295
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,920
off of like $100 base, right.

296
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,010
These are like real money.

297
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,295
And both of them took it
all and bought crypto.

298
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:35,370
- [Audience Member] Woo!

299
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,372
- Yes.

300
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:37,760
(audience laughter)

301
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,910
Yes.

302
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,460
By the way, I believe in blockchain

303
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,370
as a technology out my ass.

304
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,910
The part of the story he doesn't know

305
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,682
is they bought at 17,000.

306
00:11:47,682 --> 00:11:49,099
- [Audience] Aww.

307
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:55,030
And they bought at 17,000
because they read 400 articles

308
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,130
that said it was gonna be 34,000.

309
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:01,240
And by the way, Bitcoin could
be 400,000, I'm not sure.

310
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,270
I don't know.

311
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,740
Here's what I'm disappointed
in, short term thinking.

312
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,240
When he goes woo, I'm not mad at him,

313
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,390
I'm like listen, maybe, long term.

314
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,870
I don't know anybody's money situation.

315
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,830
Let me give you something
that will really work for you.

316
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,440
If you don't have to take
it out of Wall Street,

317
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,890
put your money into Facebook and Amazon,

318
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,580
and I promise you, unless America melts

319
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,800
over the next 7 to 10
years, you'll do well.

320
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,360
There's certain things that are just

321
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,390
so black and white obvious, right.

322
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,990
And then everybody else is
looking for a lottery ticket.

323
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,660
I used an analogy in
the podcast I just did

324
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,480
with some good guys, and it hit me,

325
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,750
maybe 'cause I was in Miami and stayed

326
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,540
at the Hard Rock Casino fucking Hotel

327
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,530
which was fucking disgusting.

328
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,891
(audience laughter)

329
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:44,210
But a lot of people were
treating their business

330
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,760
the way you go to a casino.

331
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,820
Yeah, you could have one
night where you took 5,000

332
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,270
from the casino, but why don't
you keep going every night

333
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,040
and tell me how it works out.

334
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,210
They don't build Vegas on us winning.

335
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,920
And everybody's treating their
business that way right now.

336
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,000
Everybody's jumping from trend to trend,

337
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,530
they have no foundation of
what they're actually doing,

338
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,620
they're riding only headlines
and they're gonna get exposed.

339
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,100
Instead of taking a meaningful step back

340
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,490
and doing a lot of thinking about A,

341
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,910
how exciting it is to eat shit.

342
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,380
You know, the thing that works for me

343
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,160
that I really wished on
everybody else is I love

344
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,220
the journey, I love the
game, I love the struggle.

345
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,720
Do you know why I keep doing new things?

346
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,160
'Cause I like when people clown on me.

347
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,530
You know why I came out with a sneaker,

348
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,560
my own sneaker, especially
growing up in that era?

349
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,240
Because I knew people
were gonna shit on me

350
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,450
thinking I had too big
of an ego and audacity,

351
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,560
and I knew people didn't
think it was gonna work.

352
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,700
And that's why I did it,
'cause I wanted that struggle.

353
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,220
And then the high of outselling future

354
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,970
and weekend sneakers combined, that high

355
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,800
is the greatest and the low, that's my L.

356
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,240
When you love the game that
you're in, you win either way.

357
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,820
You either win and you get to talk shit,

358
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,780
or you lose and your boys get to talk shit

359
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,820
and you laugh along with them.

360
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,390
The biggest problem
right now is insecurity.

361
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,860
Everybody's actions are to get shit

362
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,810
to close their insecurity.

363
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,200
You need a new pair of fucking Supremes

364
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,230
because you wanna tell
people who you are through

365
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,170
your Supremes, but you're just fucking

366
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,500
disguising your weakness.

367
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,370
And so I am absolutely obsessed for people

368
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,780
to start talking about
self-awareness and patience,

369
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,010
'cause they will work.

370
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,010
Now, it might take 15
years, it may take seven,

371
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,870
it may take nine, but if you actually take

372
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,310
tried and true things
like that during a time

373
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:34,950
where there's this much
opportunity, it's not sexy

374
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,680
to walk around and say
you buy weird like candles

375
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,130
in China and sell them on Amazon

376
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,100
and make $7,000 a month, but it works.

377
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,270
And I've literally sat in rooms

378
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,710
and had these one on one discussions,

379
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,980
and kids have chosen the sexier thing

380
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,120
because we're playing one
big fucking game of optics.

381
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,000
We're playing one fucking
big game of optics.

382
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,050
And like, VC is super interesting to me,

383
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,460
I did really well, right, here's my story.

384
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,800
I made a lot of money
selling baseball cards a kid.

385
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,420
My dad worked his fucking face
off and saved every dollar,

386
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,610
immigrants have figured it out.

387
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,680
It's called make money, buy no dumb shit,

388
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,410
save it for 13 years, buy an
asset, have the American Dream.

389
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,440
Right?

390
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,860
Versus what's going on,
by the way, new prediction

391
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,940
'cause I've been doing some homework,

392
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,280
college debt is gonna take
the whole country down.

393
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,050
I had no idea, I don't know, you know,

394
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,060
I knew college debt was fucked up.

395
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,210
I didn't know the following thing

396
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,820
that I've been doing homework
on the last three days.

397
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,140
This story is real and is being scaled

398
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,981
across America right now.

399
00:15:37,981 --> 00:15:40,700
You're $237,000 in college
debt on some interest

400
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,950
that's fucking bonkers.

401
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,070
You're making $84,000 a year
and banks are lending you

402
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,050
a half a million to buy an apartment.

403
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:47,883
(audience laughter)

404
00:15:47,883 --> 00:15:51,180
So just get ready, 2009
is coming all over again.

405
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,810
I don't know how long Trump
can artificially hold it up,

406
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,700
but shit's gonna hit
and it's gonna hit hard.

407
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,040
And here's what's gonna happen.

408
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,970
Everybody's gonna blame the
colleges, 'cause you know,

409
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,410
Omar who needed a new BMW,
even though he had $313,000

410
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,790
in debt, he's not gonna
blame himself for the BMW,

411
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,990
he's gonna blame Babson.

412
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,250
And so colleges' brand's about
to get fucking collapsed.

413
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,010
Just like the banks got shit on.

414
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,270
Including all of these opportunities

415
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,810
that we know are good alternatives.

416
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,580
You know, by the way, 1930, 1940, 1950,

417
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,840
vocational skills were hot.

418
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,920
Then the propaganda of
college came through.

419
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,040
Which is cool 'cause
it worked for a minute.

420
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,140
It's just, shit changes.

421
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,140
And so we're living through
a really really really really

422
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,220
interesting time, because
there's so much carnage

423
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,020
in the system ready to
come, at the same token,

424
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,980
it's never been better for all of us,

425
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,400
because the scale of anything you wanna do

426
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,340
on the Internet is actually real.

427
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,210
It's never been more practical
to make $100,000 a year

428
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,919
talking about fucking the Smurfs.

429
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,420
(audience laughter)

430
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,300
It's the truth.

431
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,630
Like, if you look at the niches,

432
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,610
if you actually play out a
podcast, a YouTube channel

433
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,980
and an Instagram account
and really understand

434
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,400
how to build stories like my man just did,

435
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,420
day in and day out consistent,
especially if you know

436
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,170
what the fuck you're talking
about and have patience,

437
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,200
you will be stunned how much
money is gonna be for you

438
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
on the other side of that rainbow.

439
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,060
And the only way you'll
do it while nothing good

440
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,349
is happening is you'll talk about

441
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:15,159
the shit you love the most.

442
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,960
You could talk about the
1987 Pistons for a living.

443
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,250
That's crazy.

444
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,390
By the way, the 87 Pistons
really fucked with Jordan,

445
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,862
which is why I had to
drop in on my man Jason.

446
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:26,520
(audience laughter)

447
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,710
I know you do, man.

448
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,070
I got none, fuck.

449
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,640
This is why I wanna buy
the Jets, I'm like fuck it,

450
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,780
nobody else is gonna do it for me,

451
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,700
I'm gonna buy the Jets
and win my own Superbowl.

452
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,664
Anyway.

453
00:17:35,664 --> 00:17:36,970
(audience laughter)

454
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,090
Then I built my dad's business for him,

455
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,930
I left at 34, I had no
equity in the business,

456
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:42,780
I haven't saved a lot of money

457
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,670
'cause we poured all money
back into the business,

458
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,020
I grew my dad's business from a $3

459
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,600
to a $60 million business.

460
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,340
I paid back my parents for giving to me.

461
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,940
And then I did something really smart,

462
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,280
I was building a liquor
store that my dad owned

463
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,980
into a winy commerce business.

464
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,090
And I was using modern technologies.

465
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,150
And along the way, I
realized that social media

466
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,030
was the second coming of
what I saw with Google

467
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,870
and blogging and email,
and so I just understood

468
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,910
the pattern recognition,
so I was an early investor

469
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:11,040
in Facebook and Twitter
and Tumblr and obviously,

470
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,170
as you can imagine, it changed
the course of my career.

471
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,630
But what's really
fascinating to me is that

472
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,050
the opportunities are way greater

473
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,270
than they've ever been
'cause it's scale now.

474
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,710
It's just that all we're
doing is playing lotto.

475
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,060
I'm a bad gambler.

476
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,330
Like for example, I never
taught myself how to play poker.

477
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,140
I don't like gambling that much.

478
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,094
So when I gamble, I go to fucking like,

479
00:18:33,094 --> 00:18:36,170
when I go to a casino, I go to
actually like own the casino

480
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,330
at the end of the night.

481
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,530
Like, I'm playing the most high risk shit.

482
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,430
Like, it's only like roulette, one number,

483
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,230
put like fucking $500 on it.

484
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,370
Like none of it is basic, it's
all like I'm trying to like

485
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,220
create memories, right.

486
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,030
Which is why I lose all my fucking money.

487
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,960
(audience laughter)

488
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,160
That's cool for casinos,
that's not cool for life,

489
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,420
and that's what people are fucking doing.

490
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,100
People are talking about
building fucking businesses

491
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,370
and apps and things like that,

492
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,280
and they're not looking at the math.

493
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,390
99% of these companies
are gonna go away, and

494
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:09,090
it's been good for nine
years in the economy.

495
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,180
There's money in the system.

496
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,270
None of the businesses
that are pre series B

497
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,390
are making any money.

498
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,640
What do you think happens
when they can't raise

499
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,870
their next round?

500
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,830
You know how many companies
are down rounding right now?

501
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,198
All of them.

502
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:25,031
(audience laughter)

503
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:27,100
Like, we are not having that conversation.

504
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,410
So meanwhile, the propaganda of that

505
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,220
or crypto or other things
got people pumped, respect,

506
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,580
interested, I'm sure
there'll be people that win.

507
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,110
Meanwhile, there's all
this practical money.

508
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,140
And listen, because I grew up
pretty ridiculous, you know,

509
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,080
D and F student in like rural New Jersey,

510
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,810
so like hunter boys
that wanted to shoot you

511
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,000
with their, you know, shotgun.

512
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,185
Then I went to Mount Ida
College in Newton, Mass,

513
00:19:51,185 --> 00:19:54,840
94% minorities, like kids
that wanted to shoot you

514
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,080
with different kinds of guns.

515
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,990
And so like literally, my whole group

516
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,960
that I grew up with from, you know,

517
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,230
first grade through
college, 98% of my friends

518
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,110
make under $100,000 a year.

519
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,250
Then I got into the tech
world and these towns,

520
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,160
and all my next generation
friends, you know,

521
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,090
60% of them have 8 and 9 and 10 figures.

522
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,510
And I look, and I look every day,

523
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,660
and I live in this fucking bizarro world.

524
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,040
And money is not the
variable of happiness.

525
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,970
I got boys on two fucking softball teams,

526
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,580
fucking working factory
jobs, making 47k a year

527
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,650
and fucking happy as shit.

528
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,870
I got a friend who's got a buck
50, 150 million in the bank,

529
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,330
fucking miserable,
depression, three times a day

530
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,680
at the doctor who's like, I'm just,

531
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,170
and so I'm looking at
this and I'm like okay.

532
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,170
Let's take a step back.

533
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,570
The Internet is at
maturity, we're at scale.

534
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,610
There's real dollars
to be had if you build

535
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,730
a practical business.

536
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,870
And we're pumping people
into a casino environment

537
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,130
of like winning a lotto ticket.

538
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,690
And then okay, fair.

539
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,350
If you're building a lotto ticket,

540
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,420
that's how you win $50 million companies,

541
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,370
$100 million companies,
and I respect that.

542
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,130
My advice over here on the practical side

543
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:11,920
is much more one, two, three
million dollar a year business.

544
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,610
But then I just look and I'm like man,

545
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,540
how many people are out there right now

546
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,120
who would love to make to make
$212,000 a year and love it.

547
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,570
And I'm just struggling with like,

548
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,980
trying to figure out how to get this noise

549
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,010
into the system because it's so real.

550
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,170
It's so real, there's so
much opportunity, and so

551
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,370
if I could say anything
before I go into Q&A,

552
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:37,480
I really would love to make
practicality and patience sexy.

553
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,210
I really would.

554
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,240
Because that actually changes your life.

555
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,510
Like, that's actually good.

556
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,640
Like, if you're sitting here
and you're really in like

557
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,060
some need of finances, I'm
being dead serious with you.

558
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,960
You go to Craigslist, it's free.

559
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,410
You drive your car, you take the TV.

560
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:58,130
You put it on Facebook, you
sell it for $60, you got $60.

561
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,120
It's just, there's so much of it.

562
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,390
And like, the people that
listen to me and are like

563
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,730
angry and have dirt under their
nails and are ghetto like me

564
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,340
that like love it, like love it.

565
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,970
They're making like 3,
4, 5, $6,000 a month now.

566
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,110
Shit adds up.

567
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,090
Shit adds up.

568
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,900
And so like, please, think
about all the cool stuff

569
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,340
that's out there, learn, by the way,

570
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,080
I know that's what's being
pushed down your throat

571
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,670
99.9% of the time, so I'm
not even gonna speak to that.

572
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,020
Let me talk to you about
the 0.01% that's not.

573
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,300
The Internet is amazing.

574
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,420
Like, really crazy amazing, like we can't,

575
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,400
we take it so for granted, all of us,

576
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,610
including the smart ones in
that have been part of it.

577
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:37,270
We'll look back when, me, we're
all grossly underestimating

578
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,470
what's actually happening.

579
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,080
The Internet is the
middleman for everything.

580
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,390
It will suffocate everything, all of it.

581
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:47,820
Bookstores and taxi
companies, they're just first.

582
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,720
Everything.

583
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,460
What do you think is gonna
happen to mainstream media?

584
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,270
It's all getting suffocated.

585
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,800
Suffocated, retail, suffocated.

586
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,090
Personal relationships,
suffocated, real estate,

587
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,840
suffocated, it's all getting suffocated.

588
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,400
Which means you have all the
same access as anybody else.

589
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,890
You just do, it's just true.

590
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,080
And the people in the middle
that used to just be there

591
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,130
because of establishment,
they're gonna have to adjust

592
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,390
and actually bring value
or they're finished.

593
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,040
And record companies and book publishers

594
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,370
and real estate agents,
they don't do a whole bunch

595
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,800
once they're established,
that's the truth.

596
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,110
They create distribution, but
that's become commoditized.

597
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,970
And so you need to understand this truth,

598
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,240
because when I look around here,

599
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,760
people are gonna live
for 40, 50, 60 years,

600
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,290
like, what are you doing,
like we got so much time.

601
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,850
I get fearful when people
are in their 40s, you know,

602
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,570
and they think like
it's a young man's game.

603
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,090
Like, you're gonna be living
here for another 70 years,

604
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,540
technology's getting good,
you're gonna be older

605
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,373
than you think.

606
00:23:43,373 --> 00:23:47,620
You have so much time, and
everybody's in such a rush.

607
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,910
They're in a rush because they wanna

608
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,770
prove something to somebody.

609
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:54,330
Either their parents or
to the contemporaries.

610
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,210
And I'd really like to make it attractive

611
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,040
to be like the person
that went like, listen,

612
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,150
I think being a tortoise is cool

613
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,210
'cause you get to win the fucking race.

614
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,043
You know.

615
00:24:06,043 --> 00:24:08,600
Maybe your mom or dad thinks
you're a loser right now,

616
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,950
but like, it'd be much
better if you won that debate

617
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,840
instead of rushing into some dumb shit

618
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,550
to make them think you're
not a loser quicker.

619
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,180
And that's all I see over
and over and over again.

620
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,340
And I just think that this
conversation needs to be put

621
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:27,340
in the system because look,
there's a big difference

622
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:30,330
between making money and raising money.

623
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,870
And we have become way too romanticized

624
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,860
about raising capital.

625
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,670
Which has a need and I believe
in it, and I'm a VC myself,

626
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,840
but everybody's defaulted into it.

627
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,740
Now, let me promise you something,

628
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,740
knowing how to make money is
always a good skill, always.

629
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,750
And I think it's time that we start having

630
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,070
a bigger conversation
of teaching people that,

631
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,540
but everybody's too fancy.

632
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,800
You're too fancy.

633
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,500
(audience laughter)

634
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,450
It's true.

635
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,750
People are fancy.

636
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,890
Everybody likes to put founder
in their Instagram profile

637
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,000
like it means something.

638
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,190
Like if I have basketball
player in my fucking

639
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,760
Instagram account, doesn't mean I play

640
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,163
in the NBA, motherfucker.

641
00:25:09,163 --> 00:25:10,550
(audience laughter)

642
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,940
And so that's the problem right now.

643
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,960
We've romanticized something,
it's very easy to say,

644
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,530
you can't say you're a professional singer

645
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,300
because everybody would
call you out, we can see it.

646
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,110
You can't say you're a
professional athlete.

647
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,500
But you just put that word
entrepreneur and co-founder

648
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,520
and you are it, but you're not.

649
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,620
You're renting that status.

650
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,320
There's a big fucking
difference between being

651
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,110
an entrepreneur and being
a successful entrepreneur.

652
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,400
And unfortunately, we
have confused the lines

653
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,840
and it's putting people
into really bad, bad habits

654
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,340
during an easy time.

655
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,370
If you're under 31 in this room,

656
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,490
you've never been punched
in the mouth professionally.

657
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,890
Which to me means you're fucking soft.

658
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,030
It's not your fault, you might
be able to handle that punch,

659
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:57,030
but you didn't live through
2000 and 2001 and 2008,

660
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,960
definitely not 94.

661
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,710
Like, you haven't been
punched in the fucking mouth.

662
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,030
And so like, if you've
been doing something

663
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,330
for two years right now, three
years and you're not winning

664
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:12,510
and it's this easy, you
better rethink shit now.

665
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,200
Yesterday.

666
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,760
It means maybe you're number three

667
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,470
and you should go find a one.

668
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,560
It means maybe you're
dreaming and playing lotto

669
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,940
and you need to get practical.

670
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,900
Because this has been
the easiest fucking time

671
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,250
to make money in the last 100 years.

672
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,150
And if you haven't figured
it out, you just might suck.

673
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,490
I'm serious, it's true.

674
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,120
Like it is cold, but honestly,

675
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,000
I'd much rather give it to you cold,

676
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,770
give you at least the
thought to think about it

677
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:41,390
'cause it's fucking true cold,

678
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,390
instead of fucking pandering to you,

679
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,290
and then when you fucking crash
and you're really hurting,

680
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,190
all those people that said
rah rah, you can do it,

681
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,270
they're not around.

682
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,830
And so please get practical.

683
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:58,440
Please learn how to make money
if you're a business person.

684
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,870
And so that's where I'm at.

685
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,267
I'd love to do some Q&A,
thanks for having me.

686
00:27:04,267 --> 00:27:06,517
(applause)

687
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,063
Respect.

688
00:27:19,063 --> 00:27:21,160
- [Male Speaker] So everybody
that creates a channel

689
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,630
can set their own price.

690
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,400
People pay them directly.

691
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,710
We split the revenue with them 50/50,

692
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,130
and you can use crypto.

693
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,270
- Okay.

694
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,670
- [Male Speaker] I wanna know,
you were early at YouTube.

695
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,503
- [Gary] Yup.

696
00:27:32,503 --> 00:27:33,760
- [Male Speaker] You wanna
be early at Reflections.

697
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,360
- Probably not, but let's talk it through.

698
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,454
So the first thing that's interesting is,

699
00:27:39,454 --> 00:27:41,290
what's the revenue share?

700
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:44,840
- [Male Speaker] It's a 50/50
split, so Apple gets 30 cents

701
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,800
for every dollar, we split the rest

702
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,218
with the content creator.

703
00:27:48,218 --> 00:27:50,680
- So the 70 that's left, you mean?

704
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,530
- [Male Speaker] Correct,
35 cent to the creator,

705
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,930
35 cent to us.

706
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:56,930
- And so what are you
doing to get my 35 cents?

707
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,680
- [Male Speaker] So we're
incentivizing influencers

708
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,497
right now to sign up for
the app and be a part of it,

709
00:28:02,497 --> 00:28:04,760
and then we will launch
at South by Southwest.

710
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,150
- Right, so you think that
you're get seven or eight people

711
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,570
that have a little bit of an audience

712
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,010
and that they'll be able to then,

713
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,310
because they're on it, get
other people to jump on.

714
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,180
- [Male Speaker] Yeah, so we
had 100 users in it from LA.

715
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,420
Some top influencers and some creators

716
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,060
that I can't mention right
now, but they are influencers.

717
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,160
- You know, usually the reason,
and I've seen a lot of apps

718
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,270
like this, usually the
reason this app scares me

719
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:30,740
is because people underestimate,
people love to say yo,

720
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,290
you need to come on my thing,
and I've seen this show

721
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,490
over and over, because you're on YouTube

722
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,960
or you're on Facebook
or you're on Instagram

723
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,970
and they're not paying you shit.

724
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,310
You need to come on mine and
that's how we're gonna do it,

725
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,380
which is the right argument, right?

726
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:48,570
The problem is, those platforms
have fucking eyeballs.

727
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,820
Everybody's a big shot
when Instagram's fucking

728
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,183
giving you the algorithm and Facebook

729
00:28:52,183 --> 00:28:54,630
is giving you the awareness,
but when you go over

730
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,650
to a new platform and now
you're asking your audience

731
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:01,370
for their money and there's
nobody actually there,

732
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:04,640
that model has been a real
difficult model to happen.

733
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,940
There's a very big reason why
there is still no platform

734
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,350
for content that is
working that way in a world

735
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,910
where influencers have
been real now for 13 years.

736
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,300
Don't let this current state
of Instagram like trick you.

737
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,270
Long before Instagram,
there's been influencers

738
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,920
on YouTube now for 12 years,
there's been influencers

739
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,070
for a very long time in a lot of places.

740
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,070
When you ask people to
pay for content, that shit

741
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:31,110
better be real, 'cause it's
unlimited fucking content

742
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,030
out there, and second
of all, everybody thinks

743
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,040
that they can move them, but every one

744
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,490
of these A listers over the
last five years digitally

745
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,700
have done some version of their own app,

746
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,010
have been given equity in some new startup

747
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,110
that has the same exact
business model as you,

748
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,360
and none of them have
popped because when you try

749
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,260
to drive people away from a free platform

750
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,890
where there's a lot of
other people to a place

751
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,280
where you have to play for yours,

752
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,310
people get exposed for
not meaning that much.

753
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,370
So I think the biggest thing you need to,

754
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,560
and then of course, you're
doing the other move

755
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,680
that a lot of people do, which is like

756
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,830
to bring seven or eight
people that have a look, have

757
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,810
an audience, well, maybe that
momentum can carry through.

758
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,600
The problem is, when people
start going to a paid place,

759
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,890
they start trying to get their audience

760
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,980
to come and pay them over
here, which starts making them

761
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,910
lose their audience in the free place.

762
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,230
And that attention was
the currency they had

763
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,310
in the first place, and so they
start losing on both sides.

764
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,920
There's a very systematic reason

765
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,520
why this model has not worked consistently

766
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,340
for the last seven years,
including companies

767
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,050
that have had $20 to
$30 million in funding.

768
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:32,430
So I would just say, please do me a favor

769
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,650
and like really really go do the homework

770
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,880
on the 10 to 15 that have
died over the last four

771
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,050
to five years so you don't
make the same mistakes,

772
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:42,220
because I don't believe that
you may not figure it out,

773
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,000
I just know it's a lot
harder than people think.

774
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,180
'Cause the theory of Facebook
and YouTube is fucking you

775
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,720
is ridiculous, they're the people

776
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,520
that put you on in the first place.

777
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,920
You're not paying YouTube
and Facebook and Instagram

778
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,160
for those hundreds of
millions of potential views,

779
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,350
so you gotta think about that.

780
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,183
- [Male Speaker] Thanks.

781
00:30:59,183 --> 00:31:00,016
- You got it, brother.

782
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:02,883
Hey, man.

783
00:31:02,883 --> 00:31:03,716
- What's up?

784
00:31:03,716 --> 00:31:04,549
A quick question.
- What's your name?

785
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:05,730
- Eugene.

786
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,610
So I'm a serial
entrepreneur, and then I went

787
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:11,020
into corporate America, made
at most a six figure income,

788
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,610
and then I just walked
away from that to go back

789
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,970
into tech 'caused I
couldn't breathe, basically.

790
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:18,260
And so I just thought
of an ad site company.

791
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,460
Basically, what we do is we do marketing

792
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,900
for small businesses.

793
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,590
We take their customers and
we, hundreds of customers

794
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,670
that come in the door every single day,

795
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,190
and we turn them into
a marketing resource.

796
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,160
So we get them to promote on social media

797
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,140
for discounts and free stuff, or you know,

798
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,220
drive Yelp reviews and
things of that nature.

799
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,680
So it's built, our
entire platform is built

800
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,035
on top of the Facebook
Messenger application.

801
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:38,868
- Love it.

802
00:31:38,868 --> 00:31:40,480
- And so a lot of the conversation

803
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,420
is altered by AI, all of that stuff.

804
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,259
- [Gary] Understood.

805
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:44,840
- So I just wanted to
kinda get your viewpoint

806
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,450
on that, that process.

807
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,420
- I like a lot of what I'm hearing.

808
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,590
I like the small business part,

809
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,870
I like the practicality of it,

810
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:53,190
like the long tail in that
world has not been exposed,

811
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,480
Facebook continues to
think about it every day.

812
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,850
You know, it's where
Google makes its money,

813
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:00,060
the long tail is extremely profitable.

814
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,040
And a lot of people aren't focusing on it.

815
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,670
The only thing I would tell
you that made me kind of think

816
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,430
that I would, if I was
an investor or a partner,

817
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,720
I'd be like hey.

818
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,320
Incentivized actions to help a business

819
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,880
usually ultimately break.

820
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,690
So just keep in mind the psychology

821
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:19,540
of like what happens when
you're incentivizing an action,

822
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,760
the end consumer eventually
understands it's flawed.

823
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:27,450
What Yelp's, you know, anonymous
breaks for the same reason.

824
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:32,290
Eventually, the data, the
content isn't valuable.

825
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,950
The fact that everybody
just heard that you have

826
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:38,130
a business that takes
a customer that comes

827
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,410
to a local business,
they get a better deal

828
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:43,060
to write a review on Yelp,
has already made them

829
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,980
not like Yelp as much anymore.

830
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,040
Yelp was cruising until
people started having friends

831
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,430
or dating somebody who
worked for a PR agency

832
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,640
that wrote fake Yelp reviews.

833
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,540
When you game the truth,
you become vulnerable.

834
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,730
So I would be very thoughtful about

835
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,710
what you're incentivizing
so it doesn't become

836
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,770
the vulnerability of what you're building.

837
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,570
You stay away from that one vulnerability,

838
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,690
every other thing is right.

839
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:10,480
AI Messenger hasn't even
started, it will be a huge space.

840
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,860
SMBs' spend on social
media hasn't even started,

841
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,610
it will be a huge space.

842
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,500
Just gives thoughts to the last part.

843
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,333
- [Eugene] Nice, thank you.

844
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:19,166
- You got it.

845
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,753
How are you?

846
00:33:21,753 --> 00:33:22,651
- [Victoria] Good, how are you?

847
00:33:22,651 --> 00:33:23,484
- Good, what's your name?

848
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:25,340
- [Victoria] Good, my
name is Victoria Ekwenuke.

849
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,240
I'm the global brand manager at Ebay.

850
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,073
- Awesome.

851
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:29,970
- [Victoria] Yeah, and I just
found it very interesting

852
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:33,560
that at your core, buying
and selling is who you are.

853
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,393
- Yes.

854
00:33:34,393 --> 00:33:36,020
- [Victoria] And you
know, a part of my job,

855
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,610
I'm thinking about the future.

856
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,110
I was actually spending some time at

857
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,490
the Long Now Foundation.

858
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:44,960
And they're building a clock
to last for 2,000 years.

859
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,770
And I can't help but think,
you know, we've evolved.

860
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:53,640
So trade, barter, commerce, e-commerce,

861
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,010
you talk about Craigslist, you
talk about being practical.

862
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:00,000
How do you think all that's
going to evolve in 2,000 years

863
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,550
from now, and what are your
thoughts of the future?

864
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,610
- First of all, my first thing that ran

865
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,179
through my head is like
Victoria, I love you,

866
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,893
but I'm not fucking Nostradamus.

867
00:34:09,893 --> 00:34:11,199
(audience laughter)

868
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,099
That's the first thing that I thought of.

869
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,429
Look, I think, you
know, I think one thing,

870
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,339
if you study human behavior,
when you start getting

871
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,030
into hundreds and thousands, you start

872
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,050
to see circles, right,
so I think technology

873
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,889
is getting awfully close to barter.

874
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:25,629
Do you know how much dumb shit everybody

875
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,699
in this room right now has in their home?

876
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,749
And then somebody else has dumb
shit that that person wants?

877
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:36,710
Like, I'm fascinated by barter
in such an interesting way.

878
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:41,679
Look, we're always gonna
trade, it's always that.

879
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,729
You know, back to the
woo-hoo in the audience.

880
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:46,460
Like, crypto's so fun
because it's opened up

881
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,112
so many different thoughts in my mind.

882
00:34:49,112 --> 00:34:50,960
The fact that you can sell me your home

883
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,440
and we can do that in the blockchain,

884
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,340
and all the people in the middle

885
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,429
that have nothing to do
with anything get cut out,

886
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:59,400
and all those economics go
back to us, energy bills.

887
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,480
Like, you start looking at some of this,

888
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,150
30% of the money you're
paying for your energy

889
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,370
in your home is for people in
the middle that do nothing.

890
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:08,480
So we're getting closer and
closer to a world of us.

891
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,800
Which I think is super fascinating,

892
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,580
massively vulnerable for governments.

893
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,860
Which is why I think it's
not gonna happen so quickly.

894
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,190
If you really understand blockchain, like,

895
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,460
China, America and Russia
are not in the business

896
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,550
for allowing it to actually succeed.

897
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,380
'Cause then we become one team.

898
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,410
You take away currency, bombs
are the only thing left,

899
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,710
it gets really kind of, like I don't think

900
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,220
people are playing, people
are so obsessed with Bitcoin,

901
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,670
they're not even on the
theorem, they're not even

902
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,830
on blockchain, like
this is real technology.

903
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,530
You're right, I am at my
heart, I mean like, basically,

904
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,130
I taught my brother how
to be an entrepreneur

905
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:45,030
by garage selling and selling on Ebay.

906
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,500
My favorite hobby in the
world, and I'm not pandering

907
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,260
to you right now, you
can go watch all the film

908
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,360
for the last 10 years, my favorite hobby,

909
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,660
like I can't fucking
wait till March and April

910
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,470
so I can start going garage
selling on Saturday morning.

911
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,720
I get a bigger high of finding

912
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,990
some random little
fucking toy for 50 cents

913
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:07,070
at somebody's house and seeling
it for six dollars on Ebay

914
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:10,460
than I do closing an $11
million deal for Vayner Media.

915
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,580
And by the way, it's not even close.

916
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,550
And that's why I keep doing it.

917
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,440
Back to like what you
had to do, because when

918
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,990
you can't breathe, what
are you gonna suffocate?

919
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,810
And so like, I think it
will continue to evolve,

920
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,390
I think it's getting more
and more interesting.

921
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,450
What I'm really interested
in is between your platform,

922
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,850
Craigslist, Letgo, Facebook Marketplace,

923
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,530
there's (mumbles), right.

924
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,380
You don't even have to be,
if you wanna be efficient

925
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,760
and actually make money,
and not just do it

926
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,210
for fun like I do, you don't need

927
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:40,250
to leave your room and just buy shit

928
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:43,130
in between the five platforms
and find the arbitrage.

929
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:47,840
It's crazy, it's crazy, it's
an amazing time for retail.

930
00:36:50,192 --> 00:36:52,710
It's just an amazing time,
you've got big box retailers

931
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,730
going out of business, but we can like,

932
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,490
if you ask me what is the one thing

933
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:00,950
that everybody in this room
has the best capability

934
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:03,510
to build a $500,000 a
year revenue business

935
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,450
that gives them $200,000 take
home, it is absolutely retail

936
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,790
on the Internet and it's not even close.

937
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,904
And if you really understand how Amazon,

938
00:37:10,904 --> 00:37:15,500
Shopify work with those platforms, I mean,

939
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,420
the fact that you can basically
create any T-shirt company,

940
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,930
use Facebook ads to target
any long-term fan, right.

941
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,850
Like, make T-shirts that are like,

942
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,727
I grew up in Chicago in the 90s, right.

943
00:37:26,727 --> 00:37:27,800
(audience laughter)

944
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,030
Run it in front of him, he's like,

945
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,650
"I grew up in Chicago in the 90s.

946
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:34,790
"Fuck it, I'll buy it."

947
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,630
If you understood how to run Facebook ads,

948
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,150
Facebook's so underpriced right now,

949
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,070
there's so much inefficiency.

950
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,200
That's what I'm speaking to.

951
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,990
Facebook ads are so underpriced

952
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,850
that I can get in front
of every one of you

953
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,260
on the three emotional things
that you give a shit about

954
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,620
with a T-shirt and probably
convert 1 out of every 30 times.

955
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,490
The ads are so low, the margin
on the T-shirts is so high,

956
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:56,700
I can just run that at scale
and make 200,000 a year

957
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,980
no problem, yet people are
trying to solve problems

958
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,160
like build these billion dollar platforms,

959
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,250
and they're all gonna lose and
they're all gonna be going,

960
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,870
like if he doesn't make it practical soon,

961
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,520
when the economy decides to do its thing,

962
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,750
he's going back to corporate America.

963
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,510
He has to make it profitable.

964
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,510
Like, it's just the way
it is, so I don't know,

965
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,470
I'm really starting to
get passionate about like,

966
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,970
let's get practical.

967
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:21,300
Like, I know it's fun
to create the next Waze.

968
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,940
I know it's fun to create
the next Instagram.

969
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,820
It's just the math's against you.

970
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,620
Meanwhile, all this money
is sitting in the system

971
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,260
and it just feels, and guess what?

972
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,170
Back to like some of the themes,
like nobody's stopping you.

973
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:36,210
There's no boss, there's
nobody who hires you,

974
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:38,240
there's nobody who decides, the
Internet doesn't give a fuck

975
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,170
if you're black, white, girl, alien,

976
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,570
the Internet's the Internet.

977
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,430
That's why it's the best.

978
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:47,640
We will never achieve what
the Internet is gonna do.

979
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,210
We will never get good enough,
we're too fucking flawed.

980
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:53,890
Unconscious bias is not gonna
get fixed any time soon.

981
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,580
The Internet doesn't give a fuck.

982
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,280
So take advantage,
instead of like dwelling

983
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,580
or being pumped or whatever the
fuck side on things you are,

984
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,240
just take fucking advantage.

985
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,460
Attention is like real estate, right.

986
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,230
The Internet is so
young, you can still buy

987
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,510
beachfront property.

988
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:17,340
We weren't around when
Manhattan was fucking,

989
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,640
do you understand a human
being bought an acre

990
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,350
in Manhattan for two dollars?

991
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:24,300
You do understand that happened, right?

992
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,860
It seems ridiculous, but it happened.

993
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,530
Let me just remind you
who the biggest spender

994
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:32,030
of Google AdWords was in
the first five or six years.

995
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:32,863
Amazon.

996
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,200
And that's why they are who they are.

997
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,950
And right now you have
Instagram influencers,

998
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,320
you have Facebook ads, you
have real underpriced attention

999
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,110
to do anything you want.

1000
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,900
You have people that are now
used to buying e-commerce,

1001
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,080
like there's so much opportunity.

1002
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,890
I just think we're looking
in the wrong places.

1003
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,480
You know.

1004
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,730
You know what it feels like, it feels like

1005
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:54,470
there's like dollars like
on the ground, right.

1006
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,670
And there's just like a huge sign,

1007
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,780
like a trillion over here.

1008
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,560
And they're like, and
then just fall in the pit.

1009
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,972
And there's all this fucking money.

1010
00:40:01,972 --> 00:40:02,805
(audience laughter)

1011
00:40:02,805 --> 00:40:03,638
Fuck.

1012
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,030
Let's keep it going.

1013
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,230
Hi.

1014
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,063
How are you?

1015
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,150
You can give it to the
next guy so he's, hi.

1016
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:13,990
- [Female Speaker] Hi, how are you?

1017
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,823
- Good.

1018
00:40:14,823 --> 00:40:15,800
- [Female Speaker] I'm a little nervous.

1019
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,960
- Don't be.

1020
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,390
- [Female Speaker] 'Cause you
might blast me, I don't wanna

1021
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,250
end up on YouTube.

1022
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,900
- I don't wanna blast you.

1023
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,140
- [Female Speaker] But
basically, my project

1024
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,700
is called the Black Barrier.

1025
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,320
Basically, we follow black
people, I'm from Oakland,

1026
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,600
I'm from Bay all day.

1027
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,433
- Let's go.

1028
00:40:32,433 --> 00:40:33,990
- [Female Speaker] And so for
me, it's really passionate

1029
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:36,390
because I saw a lot of
black people being here,

1030
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,490
a lot of gentrification happening.

1031
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:41,460
And they wanted to tap
into the black community

1032
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,430
without being a part of
that gentrifying mechanism

1033
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,880
that's being here, being in tech,

1034
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,760
you have the monetary means to buy big,

1035
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,520
million dollar houses,
and marginalizing people

1036
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,460
who really need the
support and extra help.

1037
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,300
- Understood.

1038
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,180
- [Female Speaker] So for
me, it started out as a joke,

1039
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:01,610
like I do Bay Area Bay of
the Day and shout out people.

1040
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,810
I also shout out a lot of small local

1041
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,320
black owned businesses.

1042
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,460
Now, the way I'm scaling
this to monetize it

1043
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,015
is I've been doing like smaller events

1044
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:15,370
to get my name out there, but
we're launching a website.

1045
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,450
It's gonna be theblackbayarea.org.

1046
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:20,470
It will be a larger ticketing
hub, so if you wanna go on

1047
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,830
and tap into any black event locally,

1048
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,450
you'll be able to buy the tickets from me

1049
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,790
instead of like a
Ticketmaster or Eventbrite,

1050
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:29,250
you'll just go ahead because
I'll be the word on the street.

1051
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:32,660
So I've made those
relationships with the promoters

1052
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,010
and people that I wanna
reach out to tap into.

1053
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:37,810
The second aspect is gonna be e-commerce.

1054
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:40,890
Now, I'm not gonna lay it
all out all at one time,

1055
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:43,140
I'm just walking you through
the three things (mumbles).

1056
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:46,220
The second one is e-commerce
from smaller merchants.

1057
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,470
So if you're from the Bay, you know this.

1058
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,210
One thing that you really really want,

1059
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,350
then I'll have it on the
site, the hottest product

1060
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,510
that a smaller local vendor will have.

1061
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,860
I don't know how I'm gonna
monetize it for myself,

1062
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,910
but I know it's important for my community

1063
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:02,540
to have the visibility of
someone going to a ticket hub

1064
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,670
that reflects of the
community, they can buy items

1065
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:09,000
from the community, the stuff
that's hot that you normally,

1066
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,360
you don't even have to
go to a flea market,

1067
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,180
you can live in Boston but still buy

1068
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,010
like (mumbles) barbecue sauce.

1069
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:17,560
The third one is gonna be real estate.

1070
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,550
So I'm looking at black real
estate investors to see,

1071
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,500
not investors, I'm sorry, realtors

1072
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,900
to post listings for homes to do roommates

1073
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,180
for black people who want
a room with black people,

1074
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:33,180
but also, no, it's real,
it's real at life though,

1075
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,620
it's real life--

1076
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,590
- Oh, I'm all ears, I'm
laughing at them laughing.

1077
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,880
- [Female Speaker] I mean,
no, people getting toothpaste

1078
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,170
and mayonnaise and stuff like that

1079
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,185
is really really important.

1080
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,328
I mean, there's mayonnaise
and toothpaste and things

1081
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:47,760
like that that people are
having uncomfortable situations,

1082
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,080
and those cultural
conversations can't take place

1083
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,630
till where they can feel comfortable.

1084
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,180
So they are looking for someone

1085
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,090
who can understand their culture

1086
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:56,860
and grew up where they're from.

1087
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,760
- I agree, take a step back.

1088
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:03,820
How long have you been
doing the media content?

1089
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:07,180
- [Female Speaker] I'm rubbing
up on my seventh month.

1090
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:11,650
So far, I have had about
6,000 followers on Instagram.

1091
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:14,550
I have DeVon Franklin, I have Iamsu,

1092
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:18,170
I have local notoriety from
people just trying to get

1093
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,750
their word out there about their business,

1094
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,460
because a lot of Instagrams
and a lot of things

1095
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,700
that are showcasing black
people are showcasing someone

1096
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,010
in the front saying hey, this is my brand.

1097
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,210
I'm not doing all that, I'm
putting the people first.

1098
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:34,010
And so that's my goal,
it's to push their product,

1099
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:37,500
push them, but also figure
out how I could stay afloat.

1100
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,110
Because right now, I do it from the heart,

1101
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:41,780
I don't do it to like, I don't bet on this

1102
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,250
and put my life on it.

1103
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,083
- I totally understand.

1104
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:44,916
- [Female Speaker] But I'm working in it

1105
00:43:44,916 --> 00:43:46,490
like once it might've
worked for me, you know?

1106
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:49,340
- So there's a lot of themes
here that excite me and

1107
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,590
a couple of things I
think you should think.

1108
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:54,680
So first of all, my biggest belief period

1109
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,820
right now is that everybody in this room

1110
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,890
and their businesses are a
media company first, comma,

1111
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:03,200
then you do something, everybody.

1112
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,990
Like, every single business
you've got in here,

1113
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,750
no matter what you tell me you do.

1114
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,960
My man over there with the video platform,

1115
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,840
he's a media company first,
comma, he's a business.

1116
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,360
That's how I actually think
the next 20 years play out.

1117
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:21,130
That there will not be a
single business, Ebay tomorrow

1118
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:23,610
needs to hire their
editor in chief for real,

1119
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,200
not branded content, not the way

1120
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,400
most big corporations
do it, all the way down

1121
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,720
to the smallest business idea here.

1122
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,000
Media company first, comma,
then you do what you do.

1123
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,220
That all the upsides
there because the media's

1124
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,760
so underpriced and
there's so much awareness.

1125
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,733
You've naturally intuitively done that.

1126
00:44:40,733 --> 00:44:42,910
You've started with media.

1127
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,550
Now you're starting to see
there's something popping

1128
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:46,050
a little bit, and you're
like wait a minute,

1129
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,440
I'm gonna make some money
on this thing, right.

1130
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,090
Not that you started there,
'cause I'm listening to you,

1131
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,020
not that you started
there, you're debating

1132
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,630
whether you're gonna do that, right?

1133
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:54,720
You're debating that.

1134
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,100
You're not sure, maybe you want to,

1135
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,280
you're still early, it's seven months.

1136
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,820
You know, let met tell
you a couple of things.

1137
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:05,410
Number one, it's very
easy to start allowing,

1138
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:07,910
no matter what, too much of the commerce,

1139
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:11,360
the reason it's working
is 'cause it's pure.

1140
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,080
The church and state that you have to do

1141
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,210
between this content and
what business you want

1142
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,830
is extremely important.

1143
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:20,020
It's why I work, I put out so much content

1144
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,830
in the business world for free,

1145
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:23,550
and I have no interest
in any of your money.

1146
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,840
I come out with a book, but I'm asking,

1147
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,100
I'm not interested, there's
no top of the funnel,

1148
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,340
retargeting you, I don't
hold something back

1149
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,940
and be like now you
gotta pay, motherfucker.

1150
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,318
You know, like--

1151
00:45:33,318 --> 00:45:34,180
(audience laughter)

1152
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,030
I'm putting it all out and letting

1153
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:38,780
the karma of the relationship work out,

1154
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,770
and businesses struggle with that.

1155
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:44,200
So much so that I don't
monetize my personality,

1156
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,280
I've always run other
businesses, the wine store and

1157
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,290
an agency that tries to
get the big companies,

1158
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:50,930
not the audience that I speak to.

1159
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:53,510
I think a couple of things, number one,

1160
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:58,010
if I could convince you to not be thinking

1161
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:00,830
about this right now
for another two years,

1162
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:02,690
it would be the first
thing I would tell you.

1163
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:06,330
Now, you may hate your job or
how you pay for your living,

1164
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,010
and so you wanna get over to
this as quickly as possible,

1165
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:11,780
but I can tell you right
now, if you can wait longer

1166
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:14,100
and not spend any mind time on that,

1167
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,960
but triple down on what you
do well, so for example,

1168
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,860
download Anchor and start interviewing

1169
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:24,250
these local businesses and
start your podcast tomorrow,

1170
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:25,640
become a media company.

1171
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:30,750
Take that podcast transcription
and use Mechanical Turk

1172
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,380
or some outsource people or an intern,

1173
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:35,230
and now you've got a Medium
post or a LinkedIn post,

1174
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:37,147
now you've got written content, go ahead.

1175
00:46:37,147 --> 00:46:37,980
(background noise drowns
out female speaker)

1176
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,346
Mic, mic.

1177
00:46:39,346 --> 00:46:40,179
It's all right.

1178
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:41,610
- [Female Speaker] Oh, so
I've already started that.

1179
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:43,780
So because I'm not a media person,

1180
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,040
I come from more of a non-profit side,

1181
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,220
and so I have someone,
we have people writing

1182
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:52,660
from the community on our
Medium blog, people look at it.

1183
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:56,770
We also do a lot of, I'm
hosting a free photography show

1184
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:58,430
for people in the community.

1185
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:01,180
Like, I do a lot of things,
so it's just the fact that

1186
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,920
I think I wanna hone on on ticketing

1187
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,290
because every time I hear
people, when they come to me,

1188
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:06,540
especially black people, they are like,

1189
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,300
what's popping tonight, what's going on?

1190
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,550
I just want a single website
for the ticketing portion

1191
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:12,960
to be really important, because I think

1192
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,860
that's a motivating factor for people

1193
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,280
to look into the multimedia.

1194
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,113
- Two things.

1195
00:47:18,113 --> 00:47:20,070
It's so early, you're seven months in.

1196
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,640
And have you debated
bringing in a partner?

1197
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:26,897
- [Female Speaker] Yeah,
but I got trust issues.

1198
00:47:26,897 --> 00:47:30,660
(audience laughter)

1199
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,493
- Yeah.

1200
00:47:31,493 --> 00:47:34,980
But let me tell you something
about your trust issues.

1201
00:47:37,462 --> 00:47:39,660
If you asked me, and I'm
listening and we're vibing

1202
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,580
right now, if you asked me to put

1203
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,720
my children's health on the line of

1204
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,550
can you run a successful
ticketing Internet company,

1205
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:47,750
I would bet against you.

1206
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,350
And so like, I'm being serious with you.

1207
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:53,340
I think you clearly have
some, like you told me

1208
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:56,020
about your background, which
is where your passion is.

1209
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:59,020
You're clearly hitting a chord,
you're only seven months in.

1210
00:48:00,622 --> 00:48:02,800
(background noise drowns
out female speaker)

1211
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,570
That's exactly right, that's what happens

1212
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:07,000
when you're onto something,
and so it's moving faster

1213
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,840
than you expected, you're onto something,

1214
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,900
which now gets you to
start going into a place

1215
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,610
that you're not as comfortable with.

1216
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:15,930
Like, you're spitting
out ticketing and retail,

1217
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,950
and I heard you, not all right away.

1218
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:21,360
But ticketing and retail,
and then you know,

1219
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,860
what was the third thing you were saying?

1220
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:23,693
- [Female Speaker] Real estate.

1221
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:24,526
- Real estate.

1222
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,359
I get it, I get it.

1223
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,442
But it was a hot fucking mess.

1224
00:48:27,442 --> 00:48:30,330
Like, your thought process
there was a hot mess.

1225
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:33,080
Like I'm telling you, it's
a hot fucking piece of shit.

1226
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,890
But your first part is
so off the charts right

1227
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,730
that you need to fucking
start interviewing people

1228
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:42,760
you do trust and figure
out to bring somebody

1229
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,920
who actually knows how to do that part.

1230
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,980
The biggest problem is,
people wanna be everything,

1231
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:49,820
like wanna do everything, like we aren't.

1232
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,150
Like, I couldn't get any entry level job

1233
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:55,200
in my own company 'cause I
couldn't pass the written test

1234
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,010
or the math test for the
two disciplines, I couldn't.

1235
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:00,830
I own the whole fucking thing,
and the straight facts are,

1236
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:03,680
I could not work for my own
company in an entry level job.

1237
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,090
That is the truth.

1238
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:08,390
That's not me making a joke,
that is the fucking facts.

1239
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:11,270
There are a lot of people that know

1240
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:13,370
how to build simple tech, first of all,

1241
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:15,420
they wouldn't build tech,
they would rent the tech

1242
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,090
of the ticketing platforms
and the e-com platforms

1243
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,440
and the real estate platforms
and pay nothing for it.

1244
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,290
They wouldn't get ripped
off by somebody to build it.

1245
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:25,430
I get it, but like, you
need to do what you do.

1246
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:27,040
And what you do is you have a pulse

1247
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,520
on what the fuck is actually happening

1248
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,060
and you know how to story tell it.

1249
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,880
That's where all the leverage is.

1250
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:35,480
If you had six million people
on that Instagram account,

1251
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,360
you could sell a lot of T-shirts,

1252
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,150
a lot of tickets, have
a lot of classifieds.

1253
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:43,210
You're only seven months in,
this thing has just started.

1254
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:44,300
Back to the thing I talked about,

1255
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,110
you're a young, young, young woman.

1256
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:48,960
You may look at some 19 year
old, I saw some 19 year old

1257
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,800
here earlier, I just went
like fuck, that's young.

1258
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,633
You know, but--

1259
00:49:51,633 --> 00:49:53,380
(audience laughter)

1260
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:54,870
You are that young.

1261
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:57,270
You are that young for you to do something

1262
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:59,570
that makes you happy for
the rest of your life.

1263
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:01,750
If you go into a coma for six years

1264
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,250
and just focus on what you do,

1265
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,300
you have a far better
chance of being successful

1266
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,320
than trying to decide that you're gonna be

1267
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,310
the one navigating the business aspects,

1268
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:11,870
especially 'cause I heard you spit

1269
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:14,920
the way you thought about
it, and you're clearly not

1270
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,450
very deep into your business mindset yet,

1271
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:19,430
which you may later on do.

1272
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:21,850
But like, I think you
need to either do one,

1273
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:23,420
I'm trying to give you really good advice,

1274
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,980
you need to do one of two things.

1275
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,900
Bring in a business partner
to drive the business parts

1276
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,470
so you can focus on the
content, or stay focused on

1277
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:32,550
the content for another 15
months and revisit it later.

1278
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,740
Those are the options, in my opinion.

1279
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:37,940
I could be wrong, but
that's what I'm feeling.

1280
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:42,940
(background noise drowns
out female speaker)

1281
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,453
I get it.

1282
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,120
Patience is a strength and
people think it's a weakness.

1283
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,280
Cool.

1284
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,150
You're welcome.

1285
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:56,150
One more.

1286
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:59,340
- [Male Speaker] All right, I'm
gonna shoot, if that's okay.

1287
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,396
Since you're a media mogul--

1288
00:51:00,396 --> 00:51:02,230
- I'll get YouTube, don't worry.

1289
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:04,720
- [Male Speaker] Since you're
a media mogul who's built

1290
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,500
such a successful company
and you're looking back

1291
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,380
at it from perspective of,
you know, where you are now,

1292
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,600
what first steps would you take

1293
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,740
in terms of creating a media
entity or a media company,

1294
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,680
you know, saying you had zero followers

1295
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,070
or zero funding or really scrapping it out

1296
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:24,710
to create a content-driven business?

1297
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,060
- I think the best advice
for a content-driven business

1298
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,105
is to scratch your own itch.

1299
00:51:29,105 --> 00:51:30,130
- [Male Speaker] Scratch your what?

1300
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:31,340
- Own itch.

1301
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:34,570
Like, make the media company, the blog,

1302
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:37,090
the Instagram account
that you wish existed.

1303
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:40,290
Because you know it.

1304
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:41,920
You know it, you're one of it.

1305
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,780
Like, we're on, guys, do you know

1306
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:46,630
how big forums still are on the Internet?

1307
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:50,810
Like, 1994 technology,
because little groups,

1308
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,080
little neighborhoods,
that's why the young woman

1309
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,330
who was just talking who's
going to the bathroom, I hope,

1310
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:58,060
right now, it's like,
that's why it worked,

1311
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,780
'cause it was niche, it was niche.

1312
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,610
I'm telling you, man, people
try to boil the ocean.

1313
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:04,530
Go narrow.

1314
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,810
You know, like go narrow.

1315
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:10,490
Like Barstool's winning
'cause that team made

1316
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:12,690
what they wanted, they wanted irreverence,

1317
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:14,840
they wanted mixed
culture, a different way.

1318
00:52:15,801 --> 00:52:17,380
That's the only way to break through,

1319
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,840
'cause you have to understand,
it's an incredible time,

1320
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,270
but all of us can do it.

1321
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,890
So it's a supply and demand issue, right.

1322
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:28,610
It's an incredible time,
it's an incredible time.

1323
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,450
But everybody can start one.

1324
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:33,950
So it's easy and hard.

1325
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:36,360
Which means to me go deep as fuck.

1326
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:40,960
Like, go very narrow to
what you know, right.

1327
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,900
And go deep deep deep into that,

1328
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:43,733
I think that's the place to go,

1329
00:52:43,733 --> 00:52:46,480
and then use the modern places
where there's attention.

1330
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,230
You start a media company today,

1331
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:51,060
you should be voice and social first,

1332
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:53,600
not website and email first.

1333
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,640
'Cause it's underpriced attention.

1334
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,330
You can take that attention from Instagram

1335
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:00,580
or a podcast and then start a website.

1336
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,660
I bought PureWow, a
women's lifestyle business,

1337
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,500
back a year ago.

1338
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:09,600
And I'm gonna launch a men's one,

1339
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,050
and it's all gonna be launched
on the back of my audience.

1340
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:14,760
And I built that audience
in social and voice,

1341
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,850
and I'm gonna penetrate it to a website

1342
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:18,050
and other things as well.

1343
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:20,270
And so I have it already.

1344
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:23,030
And so we all have that
too, we have what we have.

1345
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:25,420
We have our lives, our
passions, our interests.

1346
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,570
I want people to go narrow, real narrow,

1347
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:30,300
there's a real long tail
business, really, there is.

1348
00:53:31,339 --> 00:53:32,870
I mean, really, there is.

1349
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:34,923
Cool.

1350
00:53:34,923 --> 00:53:36,070
And I wanted to do this guy.

1351
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:36,930
- [Male Speaker] Thanks so much, Gary.

1352
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:39,630
Actually, I have to thank
you for all the content,

1353
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:42,830
because I actually, I put it
on the streets, and it works.

1354
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:43,663
- Thank you.

1355
00:53:43,663 --> 00:53:45,850
- [Male Speaker] My problem
is, I'm a doctor, and--

1356
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:46,683
- Golfer.

1357
00:53:46,683 --> 00:53:47,516
- [Male Speaker] Yeah, for sure.

1358
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:49,450
I'm a plastic surgeon,
and pretty good as well.

1359
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:54,225
Actually, (mumbles) and I
have one startup as the CEO.

1360
00:53:54,225 --> 00:53:56,760
And the problem is, about
following your advice,

1361
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,630
we put everything on the streets,
we documented everything.

1362
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:01,150
And we got a good problem.

1363
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:05,210
Because we have audience we
built, audience for my patients,

1364
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:07,660
and we have audience
now for entrepreneurs,

1365
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:10,140
guys that wanna make the same path.

1366
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,710
And now the problem is
when people Google my name,

1367
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:14,080
they can find both.

1368
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,720
And maybe some patients,
they like say hey,

1369
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,430
I don't wanna make a
nose job with this guy,

1370
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:20,393
because they don't have
full time on just it.

1371
00:54:20,393 --> 00:54:21,400
And on the other side--

1372
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,980
- You're looking at it wrong.

1373
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:24,900
You know what I mean?

1374
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,240
Well, because you're
looking at the downside,

1375
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,130
not the upside.

1376
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:30,020
- [Male Speaker] Yeah,
it's what I'm asking you.

1377
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:33,060
Because it's a little
bit new for me, you know.

1378
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,240
Just all this audience,
and now people are making,

1379
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,180
well, sending emails in
and direct on Instagram,

1380
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:40,380
I wanna build up a
business in a new field,

1381
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,650
and an extra, oh, I'm (mumbles), well--

1382
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:44,280
- It's super interesting to
have you here, because I think

1383
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,360
one of the things I'm
trying to figure out is

1384
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,110
the people that are taking
my advice are winning.

1385
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:49,943
- [Male Speaker] Yeah, for sure.

1386
00:54:49,943 --> 00:54:52,600
People, I can say, it
works, for sure, this works.

1387
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,720
Yeah, you can buy his books.

1388
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,280
Yeah, it works.

1389
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,000
- What happens is they
get into the crossroads

1390
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,430
that happens to you, which
is you're trying to do it

1391
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:04,660
to build your chiropractor
company, your yogurt shop,

1392
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:07,470
your surfing knowledge,
and then what's happening

1393
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,290
is you're getting
inundated now with people

1394
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:11,644
who want you to teach them
how to do that for theirs.

1395
00:55:11,644 --> 00:55:12,580
- [Male Speaker] For sure.

1396
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,080
- Look, I think that's, to your point,

1397
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,880
you said it very quickly,
it's a good problem.

1398
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,890
I would definitely tell
you not to worry about it.

1399
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:22,760
Right, like I have so much, if you look

1400
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,930
at my Instagram content, right.

1401
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:25,763
- [Male Speaker] Every day.

1402
00:55:25,763 --> 00:55:26,596
- Thank you.

1403
00:55:26,596 --> 00:55:28,600
If you, but, thank you, but let me--

1404
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,510
- [Male Speaker] What can I say?

1405
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:31,580
- If you look at my latest post,

1406
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:34,980
my latest post on Instagram
is me hanging out with Gunna,

1407
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,100
the up and coming rapper from Atlanta.

1408
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,480
That is not necessarily what Chase Bank

1409
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,480
and ABI and SAP, my clients
want to see from me.

1410
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,330
But the truth is the truth.

1411
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:48,163
- [Male Speaker] Yeah.

1412
00:55:48,163 --> 00:55:51,000
- I run the best agency, and
so they're gonna hire you.

1413
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,430
If you're great at your
craft, there's nobody

1414
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:55,860
who's not gonna come to
you because you're teaching

1415
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,420
other people how to build a business,

1416
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,400
it will all be net positive.

1417
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,800
Don't allow yourself to
look at the negatives

1418
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,070
or perceived negatives or issues.

1419
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:07,300
For every person you lose that says,

1420
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,300
"He's not spending all his time on that,"

1421
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,790
you're gonna get three others because

1422
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:12,134
you are spending all your time on that.

1423
00:56:12,134 --> 00:56:12,980
- [Male Speaker] Good for them.

1424
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:13,880
Give a shit for them (mumbles).

1425
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,110
- Life's a net game.

1426
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:18,340
Do you understand?

1427
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,060
Too many people are dwelling
on what they're losing

1428
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,230
without understanding that those
same tactics make them win.

1429
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:27,170
When I started speaking
in 2009, I cursed a lot.

1430
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:29,360
And I didn't wear suits.

1431
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,240
And you know, there's a
lot of youngsters in here,

1432
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,050
this may seem foreign, but that was not

1433
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:36,450
super fucking acceptable
just eight years ago.

1434
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:39,720
And I would get emails,
then I got a speaking agent,

1435
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,020
and I would get so many emails.

1436
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:45,360
Literally, CAA, my agency,
would call me once a month

1437
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:49,090
and say, "If you stop
cursing, we can get you

1438
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:53,330
"four more speaking gigs a month easy."

1439
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:55,230
And I would reply consistently

1440
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:57,238
for three years, motherfucker--

1441
00:56:57,238 --> 00:56:58,960
(audience laughter)

1442
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,910
If I stop cursing, nobody's
gonna listen to me speak

1443
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:03,840
'cause I'm not gonna be me.

1444
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:04,673
Right.

1445
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:10,290
And guess what, I won
because the world changed.

1446
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:12,750
When you're yourself and
you're true, that's why, Jason,

1447
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:15,815
I really loved what
you were talking about,

1448
00:57:15,815 --> 00:57:17,940
could you imagine how much
the world has evolved?

1449
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,480
Let me leave you with this as
you're thinking about stuff.

1450
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,770
If you told a parent 12 years ago that,

1451
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:25,570
when they have a 15 year old daughter,

1452
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:27,810
they would rather than
15 year old daughter

1453
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:32,070
go into a strange man's
car four times a day

1454
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:34,400
instead of driving their own car,

1455
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,157
they would've laughed you out of the room.

1456
00:57:36,157 --> 00:57:37,240
(audience laughter)

1457
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,650
But if you live in a rich
rich rich neighborhood

1458
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:42,500
and your daughter turns
16, the big new gift

1459
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,820
is not a new Benzo, the big
new gift is unlimited Uber.

1460
00:57:48,282 --> 00:57:50,840
(audience laughter)

1461
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:51,673
Right?

1462
00:57:51,673 --> 00:57:53,500
It's true, could you imagine
if I had a video 15 years ago

1463
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,530
and say one day in 15 years, all of you

1464
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:56,980
are gonna send your 15 year old daughters

1465
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,981
into 43 year old weird
Benz cards 24 hours a day?

1466
00:57:59,981 --> 00:58:00,814
(audience laughter)

1467
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:03,070
They would've laughed me out of the room.

1468
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:04,720
Norms change.

1469
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,580
Norms change.

1470
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,000
To be very honest, this, you know,

1471
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,700
especially when I talk to
my friends and minorities,

1472
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:14,060
like urban culture is
America's culture now.

1473
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:15,580
Like, when Merbo and I talk about,

1474
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,610
like it's just the truth.

1475
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:19,170
It's just the truth.

1476
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:21,200
Go show me anything that's popular,

1477
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,350
I'll show you where it started, Atlanta.

1478
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:26,730
You know, like it's just, it's so basic.

1479
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:28,760
It's so basic.

1480
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,450
Literally, if you told me
my mission as a brander

1481
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:34,930
over the next seven years was
to get 15 year old white women

1482
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:38,840
to buy something, I would
start with rappers in Atlanta.

1483
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,830
Because that's how it ends up there.

1484
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:44,130
And so you can run away from things,

1485
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:46,100
you can like look at
things, I just think that,

1486
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,480
no matter where you are or
what you are, look at hip-hop,

1487
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,150
I'm 42, I grew up with hip-hop where guys

1488
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:55,230
faked how hard they
worked 'cause their aunt

1489
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:58,580
lived in Oakland and they
visited her once a year.

1490
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,620
And they said they were from Oakland,

1491
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,090
but they weren't fucking too sure.

1492
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:02,923
You know what I mean?

1493
00:59:02,923 --> 00:59:06,830
They were fucking bullshit,
but in 1992, 93, 94,

1494
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:09,150
people remember it, you had
to pretend you were hard

1495
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:10,820
'cause there was only one move.

1496
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:13,765
Lil Yachty would've got
his face beaten in 1992.

1497
00:59:13,765 --> 00:59:15,620
(audience laughter)

1498
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,210
Yeah, right?

1499
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:20,970
But if you stayed true,
it would've come to you,

1500
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:23,310
because now everything is acceptable.

1501
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,970
And so everybody is
deviating into something.

1502
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:28,230
I say put your fucking flag on the ground

1503
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:30,900
of who the fuck you are,
I have a funny feeling

1504
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,090
it's gonna come to you,
especially with the way

1505
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:34,390
the world's working now.

1506
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:37,020
Because what all this Harvey
Weinstein and Matt Lauer stuff

1507
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:38,530
is it's all very simple.

1508
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:39,800
It's over.

1509
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,670
The Internet, there is no hiding,

1510
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:43,880
everything will be exposed.

1511
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,860
Do you know how great the
world is gonna be in 50 years?

1512
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,210
Let me make you optimistic.

1513
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:49,200
We're taking one step
backwards, you know why?

1514
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,880
We're facing shit we need to face.

1515
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,620
We've been faking the truth.

1516
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,390
And so we're taking one big step back

1517
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:57,350
and we're dealing with it.

1518
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:59,480
It's like, it's gonna be
a painful fucking decade,

1519
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,210
it hasn't even started.

1520
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:02,450
We're gonna be dealing with a lot of shit,

1521
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:04,040
but let me tell you what our grandkids

1522
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,320
are gonna be living through.

1523
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,610
They're gonna be living through a world,

1524
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:09,290
because of the full
exposure of who we are,

1525
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:12,950
where everybody realizes
everybody's got fucked up shit.

1526
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:18,270
There's not a person in
here, not one person in here

1527
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:19,530
that doesn't do something that

1528
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:22,410
we consider right now a real flaw.

1529
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:25,660
It's just the truth, it's just the truth.

1530
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:28,480
We as a collective have to
go through the pain of that,

1531
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,610
but when we get on the other side,

1532
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:32,880
like when we're all old
and we're looking at this,

1533
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,530
remember this talk.

1534
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:36,385
That's pretty egotistical,
but try to like--

1535
01:00:36,385 --> 01:00:37,610
(audience laughter)

1536
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:40,270
Try to build on this yourself
and forget where it started.

1537
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:41,660
Let me go that route.

1538
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:44,000
We're gonna be happy 'cause
it's gonna be different.

1539
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,320
It's gonna be real real different
because everybody's gonna

1540
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,350
start accepting people's shortcomings.

1541
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:50,690
And we're gonna have very
different conversations,

1542
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:53,900
and things like marriage
and things like money

1543
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,180
and sex and race, like we're gonna have

1544
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:58,550
some real conversations
over the next 20-30 years,

1545
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:00,800
get ready 'cause this isn't gonna stop.

1546
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,890
And we are just not the
animals that we wish we were.

1547
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:07,000
And we just have to face that, own it,

1548
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,810
go through that painful process.

1549
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:11,770
But we will be much better
people in 50 years from today

1550
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:14,540
because of this time during this era,

1551
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,390
because the Internet is exposing us,

1552
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:18,060
and I'm very grateful for that.

1553
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:20,350
I'm happy 'cause the truth should win,

1554
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:21,670
but you've gotta go through some shit

1555
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:24,400
to get to the other side, and
that's what we're gonna do.

1556
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,510
That's cool on a holistic
level that I'm sure a lot

1557
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:28,620
of people, looking around here,
are very passionate about.

1558
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:31,970
On your own personal level,
do that with yourself

1559
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:34,760
as a person and as an
entrepreneur, and shit will go

1560
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,530
in a totally different
place, I promise you.

1561
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:39,570
Own your shortcomings, own your strengths,

1562
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:42,130
surround yourself with the other shit,

1563
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:44,320
and stuff starts to pop.

1564
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,398
Thank you for having me.

1565
01:01:45,398 --> 01:01:48,481
(applause, cheering)

1566
01:01:50,187 --> 01:01:52,520
(pop music)

1567
01:01:53,606 --> 00:00:00,000
(calm music)
