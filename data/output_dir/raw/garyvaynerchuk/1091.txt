00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tommy Lasorda Gary I want to ask</font>

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,000
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep your people</font>

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,170
motivated Tommy thanks for the great

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,660
question uh you know obviously being one

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,429
of the great managers of all time this

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,500
answer is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to come very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to you</font>

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,680
and very natural I think you'll get it I

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,520
think I spend a lot of time thinking

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,140
about motivation and I think the key for

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,800
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I try to motivate in a couple ways</font>

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,230
number one by example I think my actions

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,730
will always speak louder than my words

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,650
so how I carry myself how I interact

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,440
everybody how I live<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself let me live</font>

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">my life as a man I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really matters</font>

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,550
as a and as an executive as a person I

17
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,219
think everyone's always watching but I

18
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,710
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I equally try to reverse them</font>

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,440
in your every single individual person

20
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,030
right they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> all different they</font>

21
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,950
all have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kpi's different</font>

22
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,510
objectives they're in different parts of

23
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,370
their lives some are married some just

24
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,620
had kids some are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make more</font>

25
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,820
money some don't want to have four

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,710
roommates in Brooklyn like so they're

27
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,059
grinding so like everybody's got a

28
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,170
different thing and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's</font>

29
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,019
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me to motivate is to do a</font>

30
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">great job listening to what makes them</font>

31
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,040

51
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,890
never tell me the truth usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> upfront</font>

52
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">few and far between and so it's a</font>

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,180
things like I took that<font color="#E5E5E5"> very seriously</font>

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,788
like I know these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> about my peeps</font>

61
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:10,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">is long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before india was on the inner</font>

62
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,150
circle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the this team like like</font>

63
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,959
like I remembered it better than you did

64
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,079
seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> so like I mean so I take an</font>

65
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,870
enormous flick you don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

66
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,060
great all-time leader without being a

67
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,769
great all-time leader<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's a lot</font>

68
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:28,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">of work that gets put into being good at</font>

69
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,079
what I do and I'm very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very up to the</font>

70
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,030
challenge and so it's predicated on an

71
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,680
enormous<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of listening which is</font>

72
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,629
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm such a paradox because boy do I</font>

73
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:40,390
love to talk but the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of listening</font>

74
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,700
that I'm actually doing always surprises

75
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,829
people when they start going a couple of

76
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,120
layers deeper so the answer to your

77
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,819
question is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> motivate Tommy by figuring</font>

78
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:51,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">out what every single person is ticked</font>

79
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,489
and wired like and what makes them roll

80
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:56,799
and I also recognize that that changes

81
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:59,950
every single day and they have four to

82
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,290
seven twelve milestone things that

83
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,670
happen in their lives which will change

84
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,129
the trajectory of their ambitions wants

85
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:07,870
hopes and dreams and I need to be

86
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,030
prepared for<font color="#E5E5E5"> every single one of those</font>

87
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">for all of them forever</font>

88
00:03:19,270 --> 00:00:00,000
you
