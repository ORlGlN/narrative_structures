00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,009
twitter is unique twitter is different

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,330
than every other social network you

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,270
understand that right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's open and it's</font>

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,130
a social<font color="#E5E5E5"> network every other platform</font>

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,889
has become a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Content push platform by</font>

6
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:12,660
design right<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook used to be when</font>

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">you go to somebody's page and be all the</font>

8
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,929
comments there if you guys remember how

9
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:17,850
that used to be right and so that's a

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,400
social network<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a conversation</font>

11
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">twitter has such advantages but they</font>

12
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,699
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanting to appease to corporate</font>

13
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,830
America because that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the money</font>

14
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,990
is and I respect that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think they</font>

15
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,789
shouldn't completely shut off what makes

16
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,230
them so special which in a guy like<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

17
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,809
who put in the work then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that i</font>

18
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,430
would have permission because of the

19
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,920
product to jump into every conversation

20
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,180
just if you know mostly don't know this

21
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,010
my narrative is in two thousand six and

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,829
seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> i jumped into every I mean this is</font>

23
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:46,200
where we could surmise is it and I've

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,789
said this<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we even met some eyes</font>

25
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,910
is probably the backbone product of my

26
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,559
success when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it came out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was</font>

apartment and I for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten hours a day</font>

29
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,109
minimum so let's put<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in the context</font>

30
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,379

38
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,670
think people can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're just so</font>

39
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,680
early<font color="#CCCCCC"> right there like but they look at</font>

40
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,390
my profile as a host of wine library TV

41
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,130

owners and<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I providing value right</font>

47
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,290

51
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,750

52
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">ramesh permission because the context of</font>

53
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,680
that platform is its open and it's a

54
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,479
cocktail<font color="#CCCCCC"> party and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can roll up and</font>

57
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,940
too you can only do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a cocktail</font>

58
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,680
environment you can't do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if like</font>

59
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,270
you're sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> at your desk working and</font>

60
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,810
I tap you doing hey you know and so and

61
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,509
so that's what every other platform does

62
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:07,369
its push it so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think twitter's missing</font>

63
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:08,720
option plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think they're</font>

64
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,788
educating people on the platform my I

65
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:13,070
made a SlideShare a little while ago

66
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,810
that talks about the fact that if you

67
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,880
start a tweet with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hat civil only</font>

68
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,450
the people who follow both of you see it

69
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,340
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of people it's a at Gary B is</font>

70
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,570
the shit because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're trying to tell</font>

71
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,730
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll awesome and I'm missing</font>

72
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,680
all my PR out of that this is me off

73
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,720
right and nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that like they</font>

74
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,120
don't explain their product enough to

75
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,489
the masses and so they defaulted into

76
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:37,880
thinking the 2007-8<font color="#E5E5E5"> crew we remember but</font>

77
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,140
a lot I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean there's people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here that</font>

78
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,880
didn't know that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your tweet</font>

79
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,430
with the @ symbol and say that Cornell

80
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,650
Tech has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great experience only</font>

81
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,090
the people that follow you and Cornell

82
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,130
Tech will actually see that tweet and

83
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,840
people do that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> day long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

84
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,519
world have they not not into a place

85
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:54,410
where you start that and a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> pop-up</font>

86
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,390
comes up and they just explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> it one</font>

87
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,880
time and everybody would know and so

88
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,310
it's little product features that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

89
00:03:01,310 --> 00:00:00,000
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they struggled on as well so</font>
