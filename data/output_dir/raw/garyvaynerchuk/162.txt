00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,953
â™« We're unstoppable.

2
00:00:11,237 --> 00:00:15,071
- Everyday at 3:00 p.m. we're
posting on this channel.

3
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:16,413
- On the Gary Vaynerchuk channel.

4
00:00:16,413 --> 00:00:17,246
- Yeah.

5
00:00:17,246 --> 00:00:20,059
- YouTube, we're a lot of fun right now,

6
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:23,800
DailyVee, I'm so obsessed
with only posting DailyVee

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,336
on the GaryVee YouTube channel

8
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:29,028
that I'm creating a secondary
channel /GaryVaynerchuk

9
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:30,724
for my business meetings, my keynotes,

10
00:00:30,724 --> 00:00:32,424
things in that nature.

11
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:34,756
I'm not convinced that
this is the right strategy.

12
00:00:34,756 --> 00:00:36,172
I'm really not.

13
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:37,734
What I am convinced about
is I wanna go Monday,

14
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:39,393
actually this now meeting within meeting,

15
00:00:39,393 --> 00:00:41,646
I wanna go Monday through
Friday with DailyVee.

16
00:00:41,646 --> 00:00:42,479
- Yup.

17
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:44,520
- And then Saturday Sunday
do the stuff that actually

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,227
drives to Gary Vaynerchuk.

19
00:00:46,227 --> 00:00:47,999
Maybe we can call it
Gary Vaynerchuk Weekend

20
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:50,949
and drive towards this
'cause it's that content.

21
00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:53,143
- What do you mean, driving?

22
00:00:53,143 --> 00:00:53,976
- So we'll talk about this,

23
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:55,110
sorry, just let me finish off this,

24
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,826
but like I don't wanna crowd the channel

25
00:00:56,826 --> 00:00:59,022
with two posts per day like we were doing,

26
00:00:59,022 --> 00:01:01,556
so I wonder is Saturday and
Sunday we do Gary Vaynerchuk

27
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:04,156
YouTube channel stuff
and siphon the DailyVee

28
00:01:04,156 --> 00:01:07,726
million, 850,000, to Gary
Vaynerchuk which is right now

29
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:09,324
51,000, right?

30
00:01:09,324 --> 00:01:10,644
- Right now, we just have so much that

31
00:01:10,644 --> 00:01:12,358
we can post every day on this.

32
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:13,298
- And I want to.

33
00:01:13,298 --> 00:01:14,786
- And, so for the weekends,
- I want to.

34
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:17,316
- We're just prioritizing key notes.

35
00:01:17,316 --> 00:01:18,399
- On GaryVee.

36
00:01:20,027 --> 00:01:22,564
- GaryVee right now is
only Monday through Friday.

37
00:01:22,564 --> 00:01:26,370
- Monday through Friday, got
it, fine, I'm good with that.

38
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,841
We should probably do a
little, so then we gotta start,

39
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:32,024
either we use this clip, or
we need to create an original

40
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:35,339
PS. There's a Gary Vaynerchuk
channel kind of thing.

41
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:36,172
- [Man] Maybe we can edit in--

42
00:01:36,172 --> 00:01:37,605
- Actually I got an idea.

43
00:01:37,605 --> 00:01:41,180
Hey guys, thank you so much for watching.

44
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,995
- They wanna do a follow up to it,

45
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:45,956
where you do a call to
action to your audience

46
00:01:45,956 --> 00:01:46,990
that filled out the survey.

47
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,066
- Okay.

48
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,236
- I've looked at it, and
the questions were like

49
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:53,146
kinda meh, but I figured if
we, and they're not talking

50
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,778
about we're gonna distribute the results.

51
00:01:55,778 --> 00:01:57,989
So right now you're just gonna do a video

52
00:01:57,989 --> 00:01:59,682
and they would share that video, like hey,

53
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:01,409
fill out this survey.

54
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,255
But I was like, oh, if we
come up with a good survey

55
00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:05,262
that we think is gonna have strong results

56
00:02:05,262 --> 00:02:09,155
that you can then like make
up post-mortem thing off of

57
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:10,991
that they'll post on their channel.

58
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:11,824
- I wasn't listening.

59
00:02:11,824 --> 00:02:12,664
- [Juanpa] Gary, what's up?

60
00:02:12,664 --> 00:02:14,018
- What up brother, how are you?

61
00:02:14,018 --> 00:02:15,104
- [Juanpa] Very great, you?

62
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:16,843
- Very good man, what's up?

63
00:02:16,843 --> 00:02:18,172
- [Juanpa] So the big news is that

64
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:20,488
because of the huge
noise that made (muffled)

65
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:23,085
right now we are still working
on getting to that goal,

66
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:25,584
and I'm about to post a
video with every Mexican

67
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:28,448
that participated giving
an update to the audience.

68
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,398
- Real quick, my friend
Juan who I've been really

69
00:02:31,398 --> 00:02:34,239
impressed with watching him
grow as a young entrepreneur

70
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,931
and hustler hit me up,
he's doing a GoFundMe

71
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:40,131
for obviously the very
difficult time in Mexico City

72
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:43,771
that are brewing post all the earthquakes

73
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:46,587
and I'm just really
excited to support him,

74
00:02:46,587 --> 00:02:48,808
I'm about to post
something to him right now,

75
00:02:48,808 --> 00:02:52,221
obviously bringing awareness to causes

76
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:53,134
and things that nature is,

77
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:55,426
most of you know most of the stuff I do

78
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:58,950
is always behind the scenes,
there's a lot of noise around

79
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,242
events and so I'm always
trying to be strategic around

80
00:03:02,242 --> 00:03:05,666
delivering steak when it
matters, more so than sizzle,

81
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,701
like a tweet here a thing there,

82
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:09,946
everybody feels good about
themselves as an advocate.

83
00:03:09,946 --> 00:03:14,750
I tend to like to just do
it quietly, that's my norm.

84
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,933
But sometimes you just go random

85
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:18,981
and you do stuff in a different way

86
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:21,636
and so I'm really excited
about posting this video

87
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:24,307
on Instagram right now
and putting it in the vlog

88
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:27,474
and bringing awareness to his GoFundMe

89
00:03:28,928 --> 00:03:31,767
that has already generated
a quarter million dollars

90
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:36,240
to help out individuals in
Mexico City build their homes

91
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,889
back up and so that's what
I'm up to right now before the

92
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:41,039
wine event.

93
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,051
That's amazing brother,
I'm literally about to film

94
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:45,230
my piece of content right now.

95
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,527
- [Juanpa] Awesome, awesome.

96
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:51,438
If you were to use the fact
that we're gonna rebuild houses

97
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:53,971
and it's really, really strong, you can.

98
00:03:53,971 --> 00:03:56,826
- Okay, I'm literally taking screen shots

99
00:03:56,826 --> 00:04:00,993
of this Facetime, I may use
this content as the main thing

100
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:06,229
because it might be the most
authentic version of it y'know?

101
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:08,892
- [Juanpa] Okay, copy that.

102
00:04:08,892 --> 00:04:12,243
So should I be smiling,
should I be serious?

103
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:14,294
- The best part is I
already took what I needed

104
00:04:14,294 --> 00:04:15,497
while you didn't know it was coming

105
00:04:15,497 --> 00:04:17,357
so that it was really good.

106
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,190
- [Juanpa] Okay.

107
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,548
- Alright, so listen man,

108
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:22,404
I'm super impressed by you in general

109
00:04:22,404 --> 00:04:24,923
and then for you to be
giving back to your country

110
00:04:24,923 --> 00:04:26,646
this way inspires the shit out of me,

111
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:28,911
so I'm exactly pumped to support

112
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:32,862
and so I'm honored right now
and I'll talk to you soon.

113
00:04:32,862 --> 00:04:35,418
- [Juanpa] Awesome, I
really appreciate this Gary,

114
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:39,749
I want to talk to you before
for other types of things.

115
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:42,480
You inspire a lot, I like how you think,

116
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,493
so after this let's
definitely get in touch.

117
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,648
- 100% I'll talk to you soon my man.

118
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:47,481
- [Jaunpa] Thank you brother.

119
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:48,314
- Bye.

120
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,930
(chill music)

121
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,911
- So something that has
been really beneficial to me

122
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:12,393
is Stephen Ross, not
because I actually use him--

123
00:06:12,393 --> 00:06:13,226
- [Woman] Who's Stephen Ross?

124
00:06:13,226 --> 00:06:14,356
- Stephen Ross is my business partner,

125
00:06:14,356 --> 00:06:16,233
he owns the Miami
Dolphins, he owns a piece

126
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:17,066
of BNRX.

127
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:17,899
- [Woman] The Business School of Michigan.

128
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:18,870
- Business School of Michigan.

129
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,537
He's 76 years old, 77 years old,

130
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,233
and he acts like me, and he
acts like kids younger than me.

131
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:29,233
He's 77 an on straight fucking fire.

132
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,919
And it's been great
because when I got to him

133
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:35,627
I'd come out of a decade of Silicon Valley

134
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:37,967
19 year olds, right?

135
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:41,063
And I'm in such a great
place, I'm 41 years old,

136
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:45,110
I'll be 42 in November,
and I think for real,

137
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,023
that a lot of probably why
I think I can buy the Jets

138
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:48,632
and other things is

139
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:50,757
and I talk before a lot about
this, we're very friendly,

140
00:06:50,757 --> 00:06:52,132
and I'm always like, we're just starting,

141
00:06:52,132 --> 00:06:55,172
this is like where do you think we are?

142
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:59,443
I think, I genuinely think
a 55 year old executive,

143
00:06:59,443 --> 00:07:03,531
a 55 year executive, is
fairly, I don't know,

144
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:05,684
getting close to maybe half-time.

145
00:07:05,684 --> 00:07:08,819
Hey guys, thank you so
much for watching DailyVee,

146
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,436
I really appreciate it, as you can tell

147
00:07:10,436 --> 00:07:12,913
we've taken a new YouTube channel strategy

148
00:07:12,913 --> 00:07:15,851
and we created a second
channel /GaryVaynerchuk.

149
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:18,631
Please subscribe, that is
where business meetings

150
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:20,361
and keynotes are gonna reside.

151
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:21,968
Not sure if this is the right strategy

152
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:23,799
of having two channels, but fuck it,

153
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:24,910
I'm gonna try some shit.

154
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,641
Go subscribe, check it.

155
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:29,141
(chill music)

156
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:39,122
You been in it?

157
00:07:39,122 --> 00:07:39,955
- Yeah.

158
00:07:41,024 --> 00:00:00,000
- Phil's been in every
fucking room in New York City.
