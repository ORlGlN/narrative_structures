1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,634
- A living legend.
An entrepreneurial hero.

2
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:07,708
A motivational speaker.
Inspirational man

3
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:10,377
that just oozes from
every part of his body.

4
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:13,881
Four-time, four-time,
four-time, four-time

5
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:16,049
New York Times
best-selling author.

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,885
You look on the internet,
you will see his face

7
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:19,853
you will hear his words
no matter where you're at.

8
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,489
He's taken over
everything. He's on Facebook.

9
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,592
Every single scroll you take,
you hear motivational words

10
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,527
coming from this man's mouth.

11
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,130
It's just awesome,
it's incredible to have him.

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,833
Ladies and gentlemen, put your
hands together for GaryVee.

13
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:33,834
(group applause)

14
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:34,668
- [Pat] Gary!

15
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:36,436
- I appreciate
that, that's very nice.

16
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:37,938
- [Pat] Gary, I hope so.
Have you

17
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,641
gotten a better
intro before? Probably.

18
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,609
- You know it's a
top seven, for sure.

19
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:43,810
- [Digs]Nice!
- [Pat] That's not bad.

20
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,745
- No.

21
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,580
- [Pat] Top sevens,
top eight, top ten, I'm-

22
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,649
- Hey, can I ask you a
question, right off the bat?

23
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:49,616
- [Pat] Yeah

24
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:52,352
- This has all happened
because, the voice right?

25
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,854
Like, people have been
telling you that you're like,

26
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,589
a radio voice your whole life?

27
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:56,423
- [Pat] No.

28
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:57,624
- Yeah. Like as soon as I...

29
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,559
The first time I ever heard it,
I'm like that's why the-

30
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,560
- [Digs]He does
definitely have one.

31
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,962
- He has it. Nobody's...

32
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:03,730
You've not been
hanging out with smart people.

33
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,730
- [Pat] I agree.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,066
(group laughter)

35
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:06,934
- [Digs]Look around the room.

36
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,268
You're a 100 percent right.

37
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,503
- I like how I set the tone

38
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:11,705
and lose the
entire crowd immediately.

39
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:12,706
- [Pat] No. You got me, though.

40
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,374
- It's just me, you and
now the audience listening.

41
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,977
- Our fans are well aware
we're not the smartest posse.

42
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,378
- [Man 2]
We're not gonna argue that.

43
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,479
- [Pat] Yeah, but much like you,

44
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,281
I think we got great
street smarts, though.

45
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,115
- Yes.

46
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:23,317
- [Pat] I think
that's kind of our big thing.

47
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:24,952
Let's get right into it.
- Sure.

48
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:27,421
- [Pat] You
flipped your family...

49
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,190
First of all, you came
over from the Soviet Union,

50
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,626
you lived in an apartment with
eight other people in Queens.

51
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:33,460
- I did.

52
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,995
- [Pat] Your family
started a wine business,

53
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:35,829
a corner store business.

54
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,931
After college you took over
the day-to-day operations.

55
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:38,765
- Yes

56
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,801
- [Pat] It went from
3 million to 60 million a year

57
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,002
in six years.
- That's right.

58
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,403
- [Pat] Because you
went to the internet.

59
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,405
- That's right.
- [Pat] Okay...

60
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,606
Asking for a friend--

61
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,441
- Yes
(Gary laughs)

62
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,775
- [Pat] For the followers.

63
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,511
You are an
incredible businessman.

64
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,480
If you were
somebody, for a friend-

65
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,348
- Yeah.

66
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:55,282
- [Digs]This is
an important question, Gary.

67
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,317
- [Pat] To turn down a job

68
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,820
in which you were
making immense amount of cash--

69
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,787
- Yes.

70
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,855
- [Pat] but
you're entering a field

71
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,523
where the cash and success

72
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,891
is at a much higher ceiling.

73
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:05,993
- Yes

74
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,095
- [Pat] Like social media--
- Right.

75
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,463
- [Pat] digital content--
- Yep.

76
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,697
- [Pat] things like that.
For a friend.

77
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:11,531
- this is a random person.

78
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:12,766
- [Pat] Yeah. This
is just somebody random.

79
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:13,467
- Yeah. Understood.

80
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,368
- [Pat] Let's
say they turned down

81
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:15,402
a professional
athletic contract.

82
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:18,071
- Right. In the prime of
their career you would say.

83
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,606
- [Pat] Yeah.
Probably the best ability

84
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:20,507
(group laughter)

85
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,341
- Yeah. Yeah.

86
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,876
- [Pat] Some random guy.
- Right. Random dude.

87
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,779
- [Pat] What would be
your first little quip

88
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:28,482
of information or advice?

89
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,117
- To sign with
the New York Jets.

90
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,953
(group laughter)

91
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:38,692
So, you know, listen
when I heard this from afar,

92
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,728
what you were up to.
Without knowing much,

93
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,797
literally, the first thing
that ran through my head

94
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,565
is somebody who
loves business, and loves

95
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,468
media, and podcasting, and
all the stuff that's going on

96
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,370
and loves and wants
to buy the New York Jets.

97
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,205
- [Pat] Yeah, that's what I
want. I wanna be an owner too.

98
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,575
- And, that makes
sense to me. What you did...

99
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,811
And what's interesting
about what you did,

100
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:02,516
is it's a high-risk move,
except you executed fast.

101
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,084
So, that's the
most intriguing...

102
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:06,319
I can't wait to really
look at your case study

103
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,889
because I think it's a
preview, not an anomaly.

104
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:12,025
I genuinely believe that over
the next decade, two decades,

105
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:16,496
multiple athletes or
other individuals in big fields,

106
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,666
like, you know
comedy or entertainment,

107
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,468
will come and reach out to you,

108
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:24,337
the same way that family
businesses and entrepreneurs

109
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,807
hit me up ten
thousand times a day-

110
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:30,077
your is a bigger field with
smaller amounts of people in it

111
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:33,580
but I see, once a
month, you getting...

112
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,115
By the way, it's happening now.

113
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,284
I'm sure people are
randomly reaching out to you.

114
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:41,588
I think it means that
you believe in yourself.

115
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,123
Listen, by the way,
this happened to me.

116
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:46,026
When I switched
to the internet world

117
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,694
from talking about just wine,

118
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,197
first six years of my content,
was me sitting at a table

119
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:51,231
drinking wine.

120
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,232
- [Pat] That was
Wine Library TV.

121
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,668
- That's right. So,
when I made a video that

122
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,970
Facebook should be
worried about Twitter,

123
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,138
the majority of the comments,

124
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:59,873
and comments used
to happen on blogs,

125
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:02,175
there was no social media,
you know the comments--

126
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:03,410
- [Pat] Age, sex, location?
- That's right

127
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,212
- [Pat] That's what you get--
- ASL, baby.

128
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:06,480
- [Pat] Yeah, you old
dudes, that's what you get

129
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,314
(group laughter)

130
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,381
- Yes. And by the
way, spent most of our time

131
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,016
making pretend we
were a girl. Where I'm like

132
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,618
Yeah, I'm a 24-year-old
female from Florida.

133
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:12,452
(group laughter)

134
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,654
You know, roping our friends in.

135
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,655
- [Pat] Chris Hansen

136
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:16,923
- Loved it.
- Chris Hansen

137
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:17,757
- So-

138
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,892
- [Pat] The video--

139
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,795
- Yeah. What was interesting
was the feedback was

140
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,331
stay in your lane, wine guy.

141
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,032
What do you think you're doing?

142
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,301
And for me, I'm
like, I'm a businessman.

143
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:31,304
You guys only know me as
the guy who reviews wine,

144
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,508
but I built the wine business
before I did the wine videos.

145
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,276
And that's what you
think of yourself, right?

146
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,845
Yes. You're this all-American...

147
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,014
Why didn't you say junior high?

148
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,582
I noticed in the
intro, high school-

149
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,317
- [Pat] Junior high I was
very average. I had bad acne-

150
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,152
- Really?

151
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,453
- Yeah. I was really good at
soccer, but not really good

152
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,754
I didn't watch any--
(Gary grunts)

153
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:48,755
- [Pat] It was really
high school I took a turn.

154
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:49,856
- I think you
should add that part.

155
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:50,557
- [Pat] Junior high?

156
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:53,393
- Yeah, it would just
add adversity to your career

157
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,061
and it would get more people
to listen to the podcast.

158
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,696
- [Pat] I think you would
respect this as a businessman.

159
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,531
In elementary school,

160
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,100
I had a full cigarette operation
happening in fifth grade.

161
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,568
I was supplying...
(man chuckles)

162
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:04,037
basically my high school,
my entire school district,

163
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:07,941
with cigarettes, until I got
caught. My first client...

164
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,476
Flipped it in front
of a teacher's face.

165
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,311
She ratted me out
within less than a minute.

166
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,346
So,--
- Where is she now?

167
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,581
- [Pat] Probably
dead or in jail.

168
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:15,749
- We should find her.

169
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,317
[Pat] I don't think we should.
(group laughter)

170
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,118
- No, I think
we should find her.

171
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:18,752
(group laughter)

172
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:19,786
What's her name? Mrs. What?

173
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,054
- [Pat] I don't, I can't.

174
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:21,888
- (laughs) You
don't want to go there.

175
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,657
- [Pat] No way. I'm
saying that name. No way.

176
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,258
Stephanie is the first name.

177
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,860
(group laughter)

178
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,730
- Last name starts
with a C. No, listen.

179
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,465
So here's the punchline.

180
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,834
Listen, I think
you gotta go all-in.

181
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,170
What got you the
hightest level of what you did,

182
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,206
is gonna get you to
the hightest level here.

183
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,875
Clearly you've got
that energy. Yeah man,

184
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,845
I think it's fucking great.
I think I'm excited, and I...

185
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:48,014
One of the things that's been
interesting to me is that,

186
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,916
you know, athletes
used to want to be rappers,

187
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,151
and rappers
wanted to be athletes,

188
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,186
and now everybody
wants to be an entrepreneur.

189
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,188
And so it's crazy for me,
on Instagram, to see these

190
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,857
12 and 13 year, 14-year-old kids

191
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,326
look up to me 'cause
that's the new thing.

192
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:00,961
And I am excited
because I am going to teach

193
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,629
them practically, and hard work,

194
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,732
and not bullshit them. And I
literally sit around and talk

195
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,367
with my friends, family, wife,
you know, I'm like,

196
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,070
"Geez, we're gonna impact
people. This is really neat."

197
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:15,008
And so, I think that you just
need to go all in blindly,

198
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,276
and I think that's
what you are good at.

199
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,978
- [Pat] Well,
you are 100% right.

200
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:18,879
(group laughter)

201
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,113
I'm really good at going all in.

202
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,848
- And, already
another thing I've noticed

203
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,718
in the limited seconds
of auditing your world,

204
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,354
you're also a
good counter puncher.

205
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:28,655
I think you're pretty intuitive.

206
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:31,258
What I like about you is the
reason you go in blindly,

207
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:34,561
is that when you taste
something, you react to it.

208
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,896
And I think that
is a big time skill.

209
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,298
It's an intuitive thing,
I'm sure it's

210
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:41,001
served you super well.
Of like, "Oh shit, there's some

211
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,903
"big guy, I'll kick to the
right instead of the left."

212
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,471
And now in
business it's unlimited.

213
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,806
So I think going in
blindly with your crew,

214
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,876
all positive vibes,
full steam ahead,

215
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,078
and when you're like, "Oh shit,
that doesn't work. Cool.

216
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,113
"Let's do this." And then,

217
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,581
"Oh that's working,
let's do triple that."

218
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,582
- [Pat] Well it's
funny you say that

219
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,752
'cause we are literally
rebranding our company.

220
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,122
So, we're rebranding
Barstool into Barstool America,

221
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:05,392
because not only are we a voice
for a city and for a state,

222
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,494
we realize that we are
becoming a voice for a lot more

223
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,629
people in the Midwest,
the heartland of the country,

224
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,698
not this terrorist
New York City you guys live in

225
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,066
that isn't even America.

226
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,401
I don't know how the
fuck you live here, Gary.

227
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:17,137
I have no idea. Got zero hours
of sleep last night. Zero.

228
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,138
I have no idea.

229
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,873
- That means you know
exactly how I live here.

230
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,107
(group laughter)

231
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,877
If you got zero hours of sleep,

232
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,446
you're only 24 months away by
being seduced by this city.

233
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,881
You know that, right?

234
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,115
- [Pat] That's a
long time. 2 years?

235
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,317
- Yeah, in 2 years

236
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,118
- [Digs]You're saying
we sleep too much?

237
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,687
- No, yes, but I think
that about everybody.

238
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,088
And by the way, I don't
mean sleep too much,

239
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,222
I think sleep is
healthy. I think people aren't

240
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,024
doing enough shit
while they're awake.

241
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:41,094
You can do plenty of stuff
17 hours a day. No, I mean,

242
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:43,596
you're getting seduced.
It means you had too much fun

243
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,765
or it's too interesting,
or you're working too hard

244
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,734
and it's going to
start switching your psyche,

245
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:48,802
and you're gonna get seduced,

246
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,103
you're going to come
to New York once a month,

247
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,204
then twice a month,

248
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,906
and then all of a
sudden you're going to wake up

249
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,374
and you're going to be
living in fucking Bushwick.

250
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:55,842
- [Pat] I've been here
two times in two weeks.

251
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:56,409
- Yep.

252
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,478
- [Pat] First time,
I puked on a street.

253
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,180
(group laughter)
- Yep. The second?

254
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,915
- [Pat] This time,
we're going. We're cooking.

255
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:02,716
- Mhmmm.

256
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,352
- [Pat] And, your big thing
is hustle. Hustlers hustle.

257
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,721
You are the hustlers
hustle. Hustler, you are.

258
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,556
- Listen, I think, I look
around this room

259
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,558
I think about all the
people listening right now,

260
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,927
and I think we are
born with certain skills.

261
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,895
Listen, you want to
complain, like I'm sorry,

262
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,064
some people are born
extremely attractive.

263
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,233
Right? Like, you
know? You're welcome.

264
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,368
- [Pat] What the
fuck just happened?

265
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:22,502
(group laughter)

266
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,338
- I'm trying to build
back up from the razz earlier.

267
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,874
So I am going to go one
by one and try to build...

268
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,809
(group laughter)

269
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,044
- [Pat] Anyways, Gary,
back to what you were saying.

270
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,914
- You know, I just
don't understand

271
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,816
people dwelling and complaining.

272
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,953
Like listen, I really,
really would have enjoyed

273
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,955
being the quarterback
of the New York Jets,

274
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,456
but by fourth grade
I looked around and I'm like,

275
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,125
"Fuck, I am not going to be
the quarterback of the Jets."

276
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,159
(group laughter)

277
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,527
And so I said, "You know what?

278
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,396
"Instead of being the
quarterback of the Jets,

279
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,164
"I am going to
buy the Jets." Right.

280
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:54,834
And so, I just
think self-awareness

281
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,370
and not
dwelling and complaining,

282
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,739
and figuring out
what your advantage is

283
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:00,940
is a good strategy.

284
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,476
And then, once you figure
out what you're decent at,

285
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,779
if you're funny,
go fucking all in.

286
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,580
Like, if you're
good at video games...

287
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,216
I'm old, right?
So when I grew up

288
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,285
video games Nintendo, Sega.

289
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,353
- [Pat] You're
not old, by the way?

290
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,187
- I'm 41.

291
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,388
- [Pat] Yeah,
and everybody thinks

292
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,256
you're an overnight success

293
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,891
because you've just
taken over the world now,

294
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,292
but you've been grinding.
But back in the day,

295
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,126
whenever you and
Todd were young--

296
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,828
- Yep.
- [Pat] black and white TVs.

297
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:26,199
- Right. Wasn't TV yet.
Todd and I were using cups,

298
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,568
you know, talking to
each other with a string.

299
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,936
The punchline is,

300
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,772
video games were huge
with us, but it was new.

301
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,974
And parents were
freaking out, like,

302
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,310
"Don't play
fucking Super Mario."

303
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,112
Like, "Why are you
playing Mike Tyson's Punch-Out?"

304
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:42,148
And on and on, and
on. The reality is,

305
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,117
all those kids that
were forced to become lawyers

306
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,919
and doctors that
are listening right now,

307
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,221
literally there are tons
of dudes listening right now

308
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,890
that hate their fucking
job, that if their parents

309
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,426
allowed them to play video
games, they might be making

310
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,596
$1,700,000 a year
being an e-sports star.

311
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,666
They could be the Tony Hawk
of e-sports given their age,

312
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:03,636
yet they're miserable,
by the way, making $213,000,

313
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,306
making $48,000 a year.
This is not about money.

314
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:09,075
The amount of people I
know making $400,000 a year,

315
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,845
$3,000,000 a year
and are miserable.

316
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:12,946
- [Pat] That was me.

317
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,414
- Yeah. Were you
really miserable?

318
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:15,748
- [Pat] Yeah, I hated it.
- Straight up?

319
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,050
- [Pat] Hated it.
- Really?

320
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,384
- [Pat] There was
nothing I could do.

321
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,052
- Wow.

322
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:19,953
- [Pat] 'Cause no
matter how good I did--

323
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:20,587
- Yeah.

324
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,555
- [Pat] Like, let's say I did
my job as well as I could.

325
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,456
- Yeah.

326
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,226
- [Digs]NFL is a, no matter
what your position is,

327
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,428
the NFL is an all year focus.

328
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:29,662
- Yes, yes.

329
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:30,930
- [Pat] You can't like,
I used to get drunk

330
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,732
when I was young cause
my body would bounce back,

331
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,567
but once I got older
and I wanted to be great,

332
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,369
I decided I wanted to be
great after I got arrested.

333
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,771
Bill Polian told me,
"You'll used this arrest

334
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,173
"and you'll flip it
into something special."

335
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,075
And he was 100% right. It
was at that moment I flipped,

336
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,343
and I wanted to be great.

337
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:44,944
It's a full time focus.

338
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,713
And whenever you play
a position that you can't

339
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,815
control the
outcome of the game, right,

340
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,151
your happiness depends on
wins and losses in the NFL.

341
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,318
And when you
play a position that

342
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,320
you can't control your
happiness, it gets to the point

343
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,222
where you're like,
"Fuck, I hate this."

344
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,124
- [Gary] Yeah I would,
that makes sense to me.

345
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,293
- [Pat] In the NFL you
can't be happy if you lose.

346
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,295
- It's why I could
never work for anybody.

347
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:03,630
In my life, I never did.

348
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,298
Even when I started my
dad's business I kind of,

349
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,200
you know my dad's not listening,

350
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,067
I took over fast.

351
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,402
- [Pat] Yeah, you took
over day-to-day right away.

352
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,538
- And by the way
only way you take over

353
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:12,705
day-to-day in a family business,

354
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:13,873
I know a lot of
people have family businesses

355
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:14,374
that are listening,

356
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,409
is I put in work at 14, 15, 16,

357
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,879
and like kind of
established my role, right?

358
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,748
So I get it, man.

359
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:22,582
Like think.

360
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,450
By the way, that's
why I'm never upset.

361
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,785
I don't blame anybody for shit.

362
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,287
I expect nothing from nobody.

363
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,821
- [Pat] It all falls on your
shoulders, you're the boss.

364
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:32,559
- 100%. And in life I don't
expect anything from people.

365
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,360
I'm empathetic,
they have their own shit.

366
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,564
If I do somebody a favor I
never expect anything in return.

367
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,699
The market is the
market is the market.

368
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,702
It's a solo thing and that
makes a lot of sense to me.

369
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,938
Team sports,
I've always struggled.

370
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,906
I love them but
being a part of them,

371
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,642
I always struggled
with because not in control.

372
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,010
- [Pat] You knew you
had zero control.

373
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,312
Especially a punter.

374
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,454
I mean if I go out there
it means something bad happened.

375
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:55,604
- I don't, go ahead.

376
00:11:55,604 --> 00:11:57,116
- [Pat] I'm trying to set
up the defensive in a way.

377
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,885
But I can't score
if we're down 10.

378
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,987
I can't do it, it's
just an interesting thing.

379
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,022
- Could make a
game saving tackle.

380
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,190
You ever make a
game saving tackle?

381
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,692
- [Pat] Gary go
ahead and google me.

382
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,027
(group laughter)

383
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,462
- You know? You could do that.

384
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,830
- [Pat] Yeah
that happened a lot.

385
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,565
Especially in the
year we were two and 14.

386
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,000
I lead our
special teams in tackles.

387
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,968
I made like 15 of them,

388
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,603
which is astronomical.

389
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,671
- Yeah but 15, you might
have had 15 random tackles.

390
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,373
I know enough about football
where a game saving tackle

391
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,808
is very different.

392
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:22,508
- [Pat] Well Gary, any time a

393
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,509
punter or a kicker makes a
tackle,

394
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,243
it's a touchdown.

395
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,612
- Yeah but you seem
like a crazy fucker.

396
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,614
You might have gone
too far out of position.

397
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:28,514
- [Pat] I set a perimeter.

398
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,749
- Okay got it, got it, got it.

399
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,451
Respect, respect.

400
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,485
- [Pat] So we live
in a society,--

401
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,988
- Yes. We do.
- [Pat] where we all,--

402
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,022
- We live in a society,

403
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,223
- [Pat] Always have,
even when you guys were young.

404
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,525
But we live in a society
that's considered soft. Right?

405
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,294
The younger
generation is considered soft.

406
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:44,297
But society is a
hustler's paradise right now.

407
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,565
There's so many
ways to make money.

408
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:46,933
With social media.
- The internet.

409
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,168
By the way, it's the internet.

410
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,104
All these things
are built on top of it.

411
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,740
But the big brain fuck
was the internet itself.

412
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,974
That changed everything.

413
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,410
- [Digs]A lot of young people
look to be an entrepreneur,

414
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,945
where it used to
be in our generation,

415
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,814
most kids wanted to follow
in their father's footsteps.

416
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,516
I want that job
at Ford Motor plant.

417
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,884
'Cause it pays
well and it's solid.

418
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:05,818
- Stability.

419
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,453
- [Digs]But now
because of the internet,

420
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,688
they're seeing all
these different avenues.

421
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:09,589
- [Pat] It's a
hustler's paradise.

422
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:10,857
It's a complete
hustler's paradise

423
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:14,127
and I even got tempted into it.

424
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,995
You got these
internet models on Instagram,

425
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,163
which they're
modern day porn stars.

426
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,531
Do your thing,
whatever you gotta do,

427
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,066
but you're getting
naked on the internet.

428
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,468
- But they're not, its
soft porn, it's modeling.

429
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,703
Let's be fair.

430
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,038
- [Pat] They're
modern day porn stars.

431
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,572
- If you go on
SnapChat but on Instagram,

432
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,474
(group laughter)

433
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,610
Instagmam they're just models,
let's be fair.

434
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,312
- [Pat] Great living.
- Hell yeah.

435
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,847
Much better
making fucking $10,000

436
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,684
to take a picture
with a coconut water

437
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,386
than making $500 an
hour at an auto show.

438
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,055
Or worse, just living life

439
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,223
and being the pretty
person in the office.

440
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,426
- [Pat] So let's say
somebody is sitting on the edge

441
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,494
of wanting to
become their own boss.

442
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,430
So for three years
I wanted to retire.

443
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,498
Every single off-season I
talked about it with my friends.

444
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,400
I was done. I'm over this.
I'm sick of this.

445
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,003
And then finally whenever
I did stand-up, I fell in love.

446
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,073
I rented out the theater,
sold the tickets myself,

447
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,841
promoted it myself,
was just excited.

448
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,975
- That was the poop moment?

449
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:06,646
- [Todd]Lady who shit herself.
- [Pat] Yeah that was awesome.

450
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:07,780
- Like for real?

451
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,883
- [Pat] Yeah she got kicked
out 'cause she smelled so bad.

452
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,051
- So good.

453
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,986
- [Pat] And my friends
didn't tell me during the show

454
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:14,821
that it happened.

455
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,456
- Well it happened
while you were on stage.

456
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,691
- [Gary] No he needs that ammo,

457
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,026
he could have crushed it.

458
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,461
- [Pat] Are you kidding?

459
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,329
- He needed the context.

460
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,397
You guys did a bad job.

461
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:25,832
- [Pat] Thank you. Bad friends.

462
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,033
- Bad friends.

463
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,835
- [Digs]Trying to corral
you in while you're on stage

464
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,970
is impossible.
- Fair, fair.

465
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,939
- [Pat] I was
hot that night too.

466
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,407
- Tasmanian devil on stage.

467
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,376
- Once you're rolling, you're
putting your life on the line.

468
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,512
That was your moment.
- [Pat] That was it.

469
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,214
My moment was
the press conference

470
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,882
that we had the Super Bowl.
But that stage is my stage.

471
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,251
- No, no that was your moment.

472
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,153
- [Pat] Yeah so I
actually called the shot too.

473
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,021
I felt good
going into that night.

474
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,456
It was my third
time doing that set,

475
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,091
I knew it like
the back of my hand.

476
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,059
I was like here we go.

477
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,327
- [Gary] And you told the crew
like, tonight's the night?

478
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,028
- I said it on video.
I said, "Tonight's the night

479
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,230
"I'll make
somebody shit their pants."

480
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,266
And it happened.
It actually happened.

481
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,834
I called my shit.

482
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,503
- It's like you and Babe Ruth.

483
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,371
- [Pat] Yeah, and I think
Babe Ruth by the way,

484
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,473
- Didn't do it.
You know that right?

485
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:08,374
He didn't call that shot.

486
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,042
- [Digs]No but he
had shit his pants.

487
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,045
(group laughter)

488
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,080
- [Pat] He didn't call his shot?

489
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,449
- No. History
changed that story.

490
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:17,984
Go look at the video.

491
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:18,851
- [Pat] What did he do?

492
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,753
- He like fucking
wiggled his bat a little bit.

493
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,622
- [Pat] I always
thought it was an ex-wife,

494
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:25,024
and he was like, "Hey bitch."
- Yeah.

495
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,759
- [Pat] Like this
is where this one is going.

496
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,228
- If it was the Babe,
it was definitely possible.

497
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,631
I mean that guy killed it.

498
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,666
Imagine being the only
famous person on Earth.

499
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,369
Think about famous people
and how much they dominate.

500
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:39,939
Now, think about being
the only famous person.

501
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,807
That's what the Babe--

502
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:41,908
- [Pat] With no
cameras everywhere,

503
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:43,676
no keeping up
with everything you do.

504
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,745
- He won. He won it.
- [Digs]He's my guy.

505
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,113
- He's underrated.
- [Digs]Yeah.

506
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,948
- [Pat] As
a legend or as what?

507
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,750
- A human.
- [Pat] I agree.

508
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,752
I think we should move
Babe Ruth up with John Daley.

509
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,987
John Daley and Babe Ruth
are both climbing the scales

510
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,056
of life every single day.

511
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,491
You know
John Daley told us that,

512
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,959
I asked him what
his drink of choice is.

513
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,960
What's your
drink of choice? Wine?

514
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,198
- Yeah, absolutely.
Right now Barolo from Italy.

515
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:06,165
- [Pat] I don't know
what that means.

516
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,466
- Well I'll teach you.

517
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,435
- [Pat] I have a
very unsophisticated palette.

518
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,304
- Dude in three years
with what's going on with you,

519
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,805
you're going to live
full time in New York,

520
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,140
you're going to drink wine,

521
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,008
and your friends
are going to hate you.

522
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,410
- [Digs]If he lives
in New York yes.

523
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,412
That means we have
to live in New York too.

524
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:22,415
- That last part's already true.

525
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:23,749
- [Pat] Yeah absolutely,

526
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:24,951
I mean it's a factual statement.

527
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,686
- Can I come here
every day? This is great.

528
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:27,887
I love your crew.

529
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:31,991
This is good stuff,
this now makes so much sense.

530
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,394
People grossly
underestimate the impact of the

531
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,829
three to four
people around them.

532
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,331
The amount of,
again, I love talking

533
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,966
to the listeners
when I do podcasts.

534
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,568
You're sitting there,
if you want shit to change

535
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,303
one of the
quickest ways to do it

536
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,905
is to change the people
you're hanging out with.

537
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,473
Now this is a rogue statement.

538
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,008
These are boys
from around the way.

539
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,376
These are people
you grew up with.

540
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,312
I'm not talking about if
you're good, if you're content.

541
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,047
I'm talking about
if you're miserable.

542
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:58,084
If you're super upset,
I think it's a really smart,

543
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:01,387
practical strategy
to take a good audit

544
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,890
of your five or six
people that are around you.

545
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,958
Because my big
thing is complaining.

546
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,627
I just believe in this shit.

547
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,127
I think there's
only two groups of people

548
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:10,563
that listen to people complain.

549
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,498
One, the people that have to.

550
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,066
Your mother.
- [Todd]Psychiatrist.

551
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:17,435
- Well yes, that as well,
but like your mom, right?

552
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:19,538
Your dad. Your brother.

553
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:23,476
And then group number two,
your other loser friends.

554
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,278
Like when you're like,
"Oh the system's fucked".

555
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,113
They're like, "Yeah,
the system's fucked".

556
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:28,648
And it's over.

557
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,283
- [Pat] In the NFL
they talk about guys getting

558
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,752
small groups, that they're
getting fucked by coaches

559
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,487
and front office and stuff.
- And that's it.

560
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:35,721
- [Pat] And it's a
cancer in your locker room.

561
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,556
- A hundred percent.

562
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,490
- [Pat] It can be
a cancer in people's life,

563
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,824
is what you're saying as well.

564
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:39,792
- A hundred percent.

565
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:40,826
- [Pat] That's incredible.

566
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,862
- What were you saying, you
were saying something good.

567
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:43,729
- [Pat] John Daley--

568
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,564
- John Daley,
drink of choice, Barolo.

569
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,365
What was his? Jack Daniels?

570
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,367
- [Pat] No, so me and
John are very similar--

571
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,169
- Close?
- [Pat] We are best friends.

572
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,305
I paid for it. But we're--
(group laughter)

573
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,707
I donated fifty grand
to his Boys and Girls Club

574
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:55,942
so we could become best friends.

575
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,844
- That's, by the way, great
if you're, back to listeners,

576
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,080
if you have money buy friends.

577
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,214
- [Pat] All in on that.

578
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,449
Me and John Daley are besties.

579
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,517
The guy texted me the other day.

580
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:05,418
- [Digs]It was cheap.

581
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,554
- I mean if Randy "The Macho
Man" Savage was still alive,

582
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,390
I would spend ungodly amounts
of money for that friendship.

583
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,458
- [Todd]Is that your guy?

584
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,595
- That is my all time guy.

585
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,129
Not even close by the way.

586
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,998
- [Digs]What was it about him?

587
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,500
- Well first Elizabeth
probably made me a man.

588
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,102
You know there is
a little bit of that.

589
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,236
- [Pat] So you were a
big wrestling fan growing up?

590
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,539
- Yes, Huge.
- [Pat] Still am?

591
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,275
- Less but I'm
historically hardcore.

592
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,109
- [Pat] See, that's number one

593
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,277
on my bucket list,
for future reference.

594
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,111
- To wrestle.

595
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,179
- [Pat] To be a WWE wrestler.

596
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,413
- By the way,
that's the quickest

597
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,616
I think that will
happen with 24 to 36 months.

598
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,317
You're just going
to be famous enough

599
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,885
and they're gonna
leverage your fame

600
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:40,886
in Wrestlemania.

601
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,488
So you're going to like
jump, you're going to like,

602
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,256
ooh you're going to
have a good finishing move.

603
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,326
You're going to kick
the fuck out of people.

604
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:51,230
- [Pat] Imma punt
somebody in the face.

605
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,032
- Yeah, so you know what it was,

606
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:57,236
I'm anti-establishment so
I'll never go for the guy.

607
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,105
So Hogan was eliminated.

608
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,740
I went on the
Nikolai Volkoff thing

609
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,274
because I was
Russian for a few minutes,

610
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,678
but then I was like,
I don't like Nikolai Volkoff.

611
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:08,314
And when Macho Man
came in, it was game over.

612
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,548
He was a bad guy.

613
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,518
He took a screwdriver
out in Madison Square Garden

614
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,553
and nailed
Tito Santana in the face

615
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,089
and pinned him to win the
inter-continental championship.

616
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,157
He had Elizabeth.

617
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,192
I was just around the age
where that was interesting.

618
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:23,062
Like he was the fucking guy.

619
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:24,030
And when I found out,

620
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,531
I apologize, and when I found
out

621
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,834
that he was "Leaping"
Lanny Poffo's brother,

622
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,803
I was disappointed.

623
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:31,804
- [Pat] That
almost brought it down.

624
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:32,571
- Almost brought it down.
Go ahead.

625
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:33,906
- [Digs]Did you do
research on Pat, cause you're--

626
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:34,573
- No.

627
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,676
- [Digs]Because you're
scratching everywhere he is.

628
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,978
- You'll find this interesting

629
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,546
and I kind of gave
you guys this compliment.

630
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,349
I have a similar gear,
it's why I think I sense it.

631
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,351
Now you, people may
have to when they host

632
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,053
and things of that nature
but DRock will tell you

633
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,254
and I'll have you on #AskGaryVee

634
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,156
so you gotta come and do that,
in the next couple months.

635
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:50,990
- [Pat] I'd like that

636
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,024
because we're trying
to build this segment.

637
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,360
- Yeah, and we'll
get huge exposure.

638
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,162
- [Pat] Greatness.
- Amazing.

639
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:58,030
- [Pat] Jesus Christ,
that's the business part.

640
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,932
- I like coming in blind.

641
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:00,766
- I don't--

642
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,600
- [Pat] Because you
learn because you ask questions

643
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,435
that are inquisitive.

644
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,103
- First of all
I'm intuitive, right.

645
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,639
Second of all, I suck
at school and reading.

646
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,007
You know what I
realized yesterday?

647
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,475
That my daughter
who's in second grade

648
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:12,311
is probably already a
better reader than I am.

649
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,712
- [Pat] Oh really?
- Yeah.

650
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,680
- [Pat] How do you tweet then?

651
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,082
'Cause like I never
read a book in my life.

652
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:19,552
- That's called writing.
(group laughter)

653
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:21,387
- [Pat] You have to read other

654
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,755
tweeters' responses,
you have to--

655
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:26,992
- I can read. I'm not
necessarily good at it.

656
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,794
And I'm busy as shit,

657
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,963
so I don't need to do work.

658
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,032
For example, stand-up.

659
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,533
When I do keynotes,
business keynotes,

660
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:38,070
I have that style.
I'm more improv.

661
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,205
I did this new show,

662
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:41,173
it's coming out
this summer, for Apple.

663
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,075
Where--
- [Pat] You got signed by Apple?

664
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,411
- No. Apple's got
original shows coming out.

665
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,847
In the summer they've got a
show called Planet of the Apps,

666
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,916
where will.i.am, Jessica Alba,
Gwyneth Paltrow and I

667
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,686
are the four mentors,
and apps pitch us,

668
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,888
and it's like The Voice
and we help them, right.

669
00:20:55,888 --> 00:21:00,092
And then we help them
raise capital from the VC.

670
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,227
- [Pat] Holy fuck.

671
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:02,728
- Yeah in two years, you'll
probably take my seat--

672
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:03,863
- [Pat] So you're
like Shark Tank for an app?

673
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:08,267
- Yeah, it's exactly,
it meshes a lot of formats.

674
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,504
Pitch, get a mentor, make
the app better, pitch a VC,

675
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:12,338
and VC--

676
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:13,305
- [Pat] Like gaming apps?
Or like--

677
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:14,340
- All. All apps.

678
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,207
- [Todd]Can we get on there?

679
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,542
- [Pat] Yeah we're
cooking a gaming app right now.

680
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:18,110
- You may be
able to get on there,

681
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,879
but I think it's
gonna be like one of those,

682
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,914
if it's a hit, instead of
tens of thousands of people

683
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,782
entering next year,
there'll be millions,

684
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,583
- [Digs]Right.

685
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,751
- and my
intuition early on here,

686
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,053
is that you won't
make an app good enough.

687
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:28,988
- [Pat] Oh, good.
- [Digs]Wow.

688
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:29,989
- Yeah.
- That's greatness.

689
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,590
- [Todd]I would
believe that.

690
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,659
(group laughter)

691
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,928
- Thanks.
- Early intuition!

692
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:40,533
- Here's why, though, because
you've got the art part,

693
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:41,834
but you need the science part.

694
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,170
I need to see the developer,
like please be smart.

695
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,472
These is where the
Pat MacAfees of the world,

696
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,308
hire an outside
agency to build the app

697
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,243
instead of giving
up 50% of the equity

698
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,611
to a technical co-founder.

699
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,979
- [Pat] Yeah,
I would never give up equity.

700
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,915
- Right, and that's why,

701
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:59,618
you know, 100% of zero.

702
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,086
- [Pat] Do the math quick, zero.
- Yeah.

703
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,087
- [Pat] Yeah,
that's really good.

704
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,889
- Biggest mistake everybody
who's listening right now

705
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:06,492
gets into the app world, they
hire somebody to build it,

706
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,594
to keep the equity, yet
they're in the "tech" business

707
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,396
and they have no
technical co-founder.

708
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:11,530
- [Pat] We're
getting ours wire-framed.

709
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,565
- Sounds right.

710
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,166
- [Pat] We learned
that word yesterday.

711
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,467
We're real excited about it.

712
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,236
- Well on your way
to loosing $100,000.

713
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:18,571
(group laughter)

714
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:19,605
- [Pat] I started
a t-shirt company,

715
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:20,773
I don't know
anything about t-shirts,

716
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:21,807
I started a
t-shirt company last year.

717
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:22,775
- That's different.

718
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:23,776
- [Pat] Just to
sponsor my friend's--

719
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,611
- By the way, t-shirts are easy.

720
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:26,912
- [Pat] That's what
you would think.

721
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,915
(Gary laughs)
- Let me rephrase.

722
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,084
You're about to lose a
million dollars in apps.

723
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,419
- [Pat] Can't wait to do it.

724
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,487
- [Digs]It's a t-shirt app.

725
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,923
It's an app for t-shirts.

726
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,392
Worst business
model of all time!

727
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,728
- [Gary] $1.1 million lost.

728
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,396
- [Pat] Your big
thing is execution, right?

729
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,965
So back in the day,
when I was younger,

730
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:48,300
I always thought,
like I feel like I have

731
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,804
a bazillion good ideas. Right?
- Which is probably true.

732
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:53,706
- [Pat] And I'm always like,
I don't want to tell anybody,

733
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,007
'cause I don't want
anybody to steal my idea.

734
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:55,574
- Stupid.

735
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,875
- [Pat] And what
I've learned is growing up,

736
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,444
is execution is
the hardest part.

737
00:22:58,444 --> 00:22:59,078
- Smart, that's it.

738
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:00,312
- [Pat] Execution's everything.

739
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,348
And in your business,
that's really the whole art

740
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:04,049
of everything, right, execution?

741
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,685
- I think the reason
I've popped is because

742
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,355
I'm giving away all
my best info for free.

743
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:11,023
I think the reason people
are watching is they're like,

744
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:13,659
"Shit, this guy's giving this
away for free, and it works."

745
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:16,262
So I do that
because 99% of people

746
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,364
don't do anything about it.

747
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:20,766
Like the punchline is,
I'll tell you what to do.

748
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,501
I'll tell you how to
make content on Facebook

749
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,536
and Instagram and Snapchat
and YouTube that can

750
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,138
lead to good things.

751
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:29,375
Selling more homes,
right, getting a promotion,

752
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,843
getting a boyfriend, a girl,

753
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,745
like, I can tell you what to do.

754
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,247
The reality is somewhere
in my late 20s, early 30s,

755
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,182
I'm like, wait a minute.

756
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,218
People don't do it.

757
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,819
And you're right, execution.

758
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:41,887
Back to wrestling.

759
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,889
Bret Hart, the excellent.
- [Pat] Best there is.

760
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,825
- Best there was.
- [Pat] Best that ever did it.

761
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,160
- The excellence
of execution, right?

762
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,962
Like you think back, Macho Man.

763
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:52,631
Why is WrestlemMania
Three Macho Man versus

764
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:55,467
Ricky Steamboat, one of the
top five matches of all time?

765
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,870
The execution in that ring.

766
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,805
Like, these are
real practitioners.

767
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,407
Not like fucking
Ultimate Warrior,

768
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:04,310
who just looked the part and
couldn't wrestle for dick.

769
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,811
(group laughter)

770
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:09,081
You know, so I think that,

771
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:11,216
that's exactly right man.

772
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:14,119
And in your craft, you know it.

773
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,622
It's funny, football's
the one sport I really know.

774
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,190
- [Pat] Die hard Jets fan.
- Die hard Jets fan.

775
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,659
- Have watched every
snap since 1982.

776
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,560
- [Todd]Sorry.
- Yep.

777
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,695
- [Pat] Were you at the games?

778
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:23,829
- I'm at every home game.

779
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,365
I went to all
sixteen games two years ago.

780
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:28,000
- [Pat] We played Monday night
in New York last year.

781
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,568
- You did, you won.
It was bad for us.

782
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,437
- [Pat] I did
a Scott Hall celebration.

783
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:32,738
- I didn't see it.

784
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,373
- [Pat] Well, so I pinned you
at the three yard line after a--

785
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:35,274
- You know, this blows.

786
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,209
Can you actually
go back into football?

787
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,077
I'd like to,

788
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:39,411
now I would actually,
now it would be fun to watch.

789
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:40,512
I mean you know, it's fun.

790
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,414
- [Pat] Yeah. A lot of
people that I partied with,

791
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,316
like around the globe
that didn't know anything

792
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,885
about punting, A, they
enjoyed watching me punt,

793
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,787
but they're gonna
enjoy me talking a lot more.

794
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,356
- I agree.
I already enjoy you a lot more.

795
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:51,557
- [Pat] Oh good.
- Yeah.

796
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:52,958
- [Pat] Well,
you're a Jets fan.

797
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,226
- It's true.
- [Pat] So that happens.

798
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,861
- Now, how long did
you play for the Colts?

799
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:56,562
- Eight years.

800
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:58,263
- Great, so you were
there when we beat you

801
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,999
in the playoffs in
the first round, right?

802
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,133
- [Pat] Yeah, that
was because we called

803
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:02,401
a fucking terrible timeout

804
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:04,203
and you guys hit a game
winning field goal in overtime.

805
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:06,205
Vinatieri hit a game
winner, it was a 52-yarder.

806
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:07,306
- I remember.

807
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:09,108
Now you only punted, you
didn't do kickoffs, right?

808
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,109
- [Pat] No, I kicked off too.

809
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:12,544
- To Cromartie, you
kicked of to Cromartie,

810
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,313
oh Cromartie on the
sideline right in front of me.

811
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:15,481
You made the tackle.

812
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:17,816
So it was your kick
that set up Cromartie's

813
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,352
long kickoff return that
really won the game for us.

814
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,487
- [Pat] Well it was
our number two going out

815
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,722
of his lane if I
remember correctly.

816
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:25,357
It was to the right sider.

817
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,425
- Back, yeah.

818
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,228
- [Pat] Which goes back to
everything I talked about.

819
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:31,230
- But it is fair to say
that it was your foot

820
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,798
that was the last
human to touch the ball

821
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:34,666
before Cromartie
caught it and went 50 yards

822
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,068
to set up the game
winner, that is fair.

823
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:38,237
- [Pat] Yeah.
(group laughter)

824
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:40,472
But that isn't what
set up the game winner.

825
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,074
- I totally understand.

826
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,275
- [Pat] We called a timeout.
- That was a great night.

827
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,578
- [Pat] Nick Folk had
a 48-yarder to win it.

828
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:49,181
We call a time out
with eight seconds left,

829
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:51,784
because we're like, "Oh
yeah, we'll get the ball back."

830
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:53,585
It wasn't fucking fourth down.

831
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,654
So they took a shot
down the right sideline,

832
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:56,822
picked up 30 yards, it
was now like a 25 yarder

833
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:59,558
or something like
that, knocks it through.

834
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,593
One of the worst
timeouts I've ever seen

835
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,896
in my entire life that lost
us the game and the playoffs.

836
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:08,233
- I mean I danced, danced all
over Indianapolis that night.

837
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,169
When I say "danced" I didn't
actually physically dance,

838
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:11,503
I went to that
place that has the

839
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,237
- [Pat] Do you dance?

840
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,873
- No. I went to that
place that has, Killroy's?

841
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,175
Love that fucking place.

842
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,409
- [Pat] Yeah,
that's like our place.

843
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,378
- Dude, you know how
many times I've been to Indy?

844
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,880
I've been to three
Jet-Indy games in Indy.

845
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,949
The fucking bullshit
AFC championship game.

846
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,151
- [Pat] How about the one
where we purposely lost to you?

847
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,286
Do you remember that one?

848
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:28,353
- No I didn't go to that
one, but that was the best.

849
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,422
That got us into the playoffs.
(group laughter)

850
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,157
Yes, then you knocked us out.
You were on that team?

851
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,659
- [Pat] Yeah.
- Fuck.

852
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,160
You won a Super Bowl
your rookie year?

853
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,994
- [Pat] No, we
lost the Super Bowl.

854
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:37,196
- Oh yeah right.

855
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:38,564
- [Pat] But we were
undefeated, we didn't lose

856
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:39,965
until we did it on
purpose to you guys.

857
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,133
- Oh I remember, to us.

858
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,301
Yeah, that was awesome.

859
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:44,837
You literally let us in
and then we had a miracle run

860
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:48,240
and then we were like seriously
in danger of beating you.

861
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,477
Then 17 to 6 and
then you guys exploded.

862
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:52,544
- [Pat] I don't remember that.

863
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,713
- Yeah, you were
losing at halftime,

864
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,515
just so you know, of that game.

865
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:57,749
You were just a rookie

866
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,117
and didn't know what
the fuck was going on.

867
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,420
- [Pat] I didn't even know
how to punt at that point.

868
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,421
That's a true story, I did not.

869
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:03,889
- Wait, if that's true then

870
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:05,724
the special teams
coach was phenomenal?

871
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,425
- [Pat] No.

872
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,927
- So you randomly Googled it?
- [Pat] Yeah.

873
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,996
I googled Shane Lechler's,
this is a true story.

874
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,098
I watched Shane Lechler,
who doesn't know this.

875
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,666
- A beast, Raiders?

876
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,668
- He was with the Raiders
and then he went to the Texans,

877
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:17,803
I got to play with him twice.

878
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,605
But my entire rookie
year and second year,

879
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:21,139
I just watched
film of him literally

880
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,274
every single
day trying to learn.

881
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:23,809
Shane Lechler and
I punt the exact same

882
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:27,112
because I tried to
mimic everything he did.

883
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,648
- You need him on this
podcast, that's very important,

884
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,017
could be a huge
theme of what you can learn

885
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,352
from people's actions.

886
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:37,990
You could change lives by
having Shane on this show.

887
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,924
- [Pat] Other people's lives?

888
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:40,459
- Yes.
(group laughter)

889
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:44,496
All humans lives, based on the
way you mapped against Shane,

890
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,632
that's what people,
this is a good segue.

891
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:49,635
The reason I do a
daily vlog on YouTube

892
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:53,472
is don't listen to what I'm
saying, watch what I'm doing.

893
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,041
Like if I'm going all in on
Instagram stories right now,

894
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,210
and putting out 20
pieces of content a day,

895
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,512
that means
I think it's smart. Right?

896
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,181
If I'm going on the
best podcasts in the world,

897
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,584
not this one, but other ones.
(group laughter)

898
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:10,422
Yeah, others. That means
that I think it's smart.

899
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,225
You knew that he
was a big time player

900
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,527
and had a huge
success and you watched it.

901
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,430
I'm stunned by how many people
would rather read a book

902
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:22,267
than watch the behavior of
the people that are winning.

903
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,569
- [Todd]We are not
book readers here.

904
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:24,770
- [Pat] Yeah I've
never read a book in my life.

905
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,906
Like when Shane Lechler
told me three years ago,

906
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,075
I was the guy, it was
like the biggest moment

907
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,977
in punting in my life, right?
- That's really cool.

908
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:33,712
- Because he had no idea
that I watched his film

909
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,846
and then he was
like, you're the guy.

910
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,415
It was a gigantic moment.

911
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:38,617
Hopefully that happens with
me and you in like 10 years.

912
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,452
- I hope so.
- [Pat] I hope so too.

913
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,887
Here's a good
story, my junior year I was

914
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,555
on mushrooms in the off season.

915
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,123
- Shrooms?
- [Pat] Yeah.

916
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,092
Me and my roommates in
college were on mushrooms.

917
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:47,960
- Okay.

918
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,763
- [Pat] It was, I missed two
kicks against Pitt that

919
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,966
I thought my whole
football career was over.

920
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,134
I got death threats,
I had 27 death threats,

921
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:58,937
I had bottles thrown at my car
in Morgantown, West Virginia.

922
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,073
I was gonna transfer, I was
gonna be done with football.

923
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,107
I just didn't have it.

924
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,443
I had a strong leg,
I just didn't have it.

925
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,378
My roommates and I
took some mushrooms

926
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:07,913
and I literally had an epiphany.

927
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,716
It was like a moment
where my roommates were like,

928
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:12,384
why don't you just
try to make it man?

929
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,753
Then it spiraled
into if you make the NFL,

930
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,288
all your other
dreams can come true

931
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:18,423
because you hold
such a gigantic platform.

932
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,626
It was on that moment that
everything kind of changed.

933
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:24,663
I was gonna use the NFL as
kind of a platform to take off.

934
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:25,931
That was kind of
the plan the whole time.

935
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,499
That's why whenever
this all started cooking

936
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,134
it was all worked out.

937
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,903
- VaynerMedia's that
for me to buy the Jets.

938
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,840
I realized in my
late 20's, early 30's

939
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,308
that I was only
good at one thing.

940
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:39,277
I always compare myself to
Mariano Rivera of the Yankees.

941
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,279
You know you
have this insane career

942
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,214
and he had other pitches

943
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:44,049
and he was a very
but he had one pitch.

944
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:46,151
He had that one cut.
He had that one pitch.

945
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,319
- Right?
- [Pat] Slider?

946
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,720
- Cutter.
- [Todd]Cutter.

947
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,256
- For fucking 20 years,
nobody could hit it.

948
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,391
Like literally nobody.

949
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:53,425
Edgar Martinez, actually,

950
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:54,826
weirdly enough
could hit it a little bit.

951
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:57,896
Nonetheless,
I decided that's me.

952
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,164
I'm good at other things.

953
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:00,632
I'm terrible at most things

954
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,802
but I'm insane about
understanding people's behavior

955
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,005
about why they buy stuff and
where they put their attention.

956
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,840
It's always come
intuitively to me.

957
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,442
I just always know
what people are gonna do

958
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:11,643
before they do it.

959
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,680
That's why I invested
in Facebook, in Twitter

960
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,783
in Uber and Snapchat,
years before they became big.

961
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,084
- [Pat] Jesus Christ.
- Yeah I've made a lot

962
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:21,286
of money in
that part of my life.

963
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,821
But at the height of that.

964
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,256
- [Digs]And you
figured all this out

965
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,124
without taking shrooms.

966
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,259
- Correct.
- [Todd]Crazy.

967
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,093
- [Digs]That's amazing.

968
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:29,061
- [Pat] That's insane
that you didn't have

969
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:30,829
to dig deep in your,
(group laughter)

970
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,897
'cause boy mine was locked

971
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:32,731
back then.
- That is amazing.

972
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:34,833
- I feel like my brain
is on shrooms permanently.

973
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,701
Like it's defaulting.

974
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:36,802
You know what I mean?
- [Pat] I'm so jealous.

975
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:38,937
- It's defaulted in that.

976
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,205
By the way, I
actually think that.

977
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:41,773
I actually think,
you know that picture

978
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,308
where it looks like
two people are kissing

979
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,676
or it's a glass of wine?

980
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,510
- [Digs]Yeah.
- You know those things?

981
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,579
I feel like the whole
world looks at it one way

982
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,047
and I just look
at it the other way.

983
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:49,881
- [Pat] Yeah.
- [Digs]Yeah.

984
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:50,749
- [Pat] That's
stand up comedians.

985
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:51,583
-That's
like stand up comedians.

986
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,384
- Is that right?
- [Digs]Mushrooms, by the way

987
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:54,086
are also a very
important fresh ingredient

988
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:54,820
for cooking.

989
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,021
- [Pat] That's
what it's talking about.

990
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,089
- Yeah.
- [Digs]Yeah, I was on..

991
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,357
- [Todd]Blue apron is the
number one fresh ingredient.

992
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,027
And it has a good
delivery service in the country.

993
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:02,961
Blue Apron's mission is

994
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:05,997
to make incredible home
cooking accessible to everyone.

995
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:06,832
They achieve this

996
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:09,101
by supporting a more
sustainable food system.

997
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:10,802
Setting the highest
standards for ingredients

998
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,839
and building a
community for home chefs.

999
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,373
- [Pat] This one's
a three pager.

1000
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,341
- This is a long one
- [Pat] Jesus.

1001
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:17,342
- They're a long one.
- [Pat] Christ.

1002
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,411
- Let's talk about
impact on the community.

1003
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:20,512
- [Pat] This is in
their ad read.

1004
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:21,313
- Blue Apron has established.

1005
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:22,247
- [Pat] No this
is still happening?

1006
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:22,748
- Partnerships--

1007
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:23,715
- [Pat] This is
happening for the

1008
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,417
- next three fucking pages.
- [Gary] Okay, good.

1009
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,986
- 150 local farms--
- [Gary] I passed on Blue Apron

1010
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,855
when I was investing. 
Passed.

1011
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,523
- Well, we're thirsty.
- [Gary] I was wrong.

1012
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,125
No, no I was wrong.
Keep going.

1013
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,359
I'm just gonna
drink this coffee.

1014
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,494
- [Pat] What's the best?

1015
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:37,562
- The greatest
miss of my career.

1016
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,231
- [Todd]Yeah.
- [Pat] Well, I respect that.

1017
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:42,033
No, no, no, I passed on Uber
twice in the Angel round.

1018
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,002
I invested slightly after.

1019
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,738
I passed on Airbnb when
it was Air Bed and Breakfast.

1020
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,839
I still look at that email.

1021
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,207
GaryVee, we're huge fans.

1022
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,376
We'd love for you to
invest in Air Bed and Breakfast.

1023
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:52,444
- [Pat] How bout this,
the next time you get one

1024
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:53,512
of those emails,
just let me know.

1025
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:53,912
- I will.

1026
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,646
- [Pat] I love 
throwing away shit.

1027
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:55,881
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1028
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:57,349
I'm acting cool right now.

1029
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,618
What I don't talk about
is the $100,000 check

1030
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,887
I invested into Yobongo.

1031
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:02,788
- [Pat] What is that?

1032
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:04,356
- I thought it was
going to be Tinder.

1033
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:05,390
Before Tinder.

1034
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,959
I was right about the concept.

1035
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,127
I saw.
- [Pat] But not the company.

1036
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,996
- I saw Grindr, right?

1037
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:13,799
And I was like okay, that's
going to happen boys and girls.

1038
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:14,866
That's 100% gonna happen.

1039
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,067
- [Pat] Grindr came
before Tinder, I didn't know

1040
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:19,137
- Way before.
- Like six years before.

1041
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,906
- And I'm like that's--
- [Pat] Homosexuals are so

1042
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:22,474
on to things, at all times.

1043
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:25,577
- By the way, subgroups,
always, always, right,

1044
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:28,814
hip hop, like
subcultures always win.

1045
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:30,949
Everything comes
from a subculture.

1046
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,684
So you have to watch subcultures

1047
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:35,020
and then decide
that's gonna go mainstream.

1048
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,688
- [Pat] So hipsters
lead the way, you're saying.

1049
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:37,589
- Could.

1050
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,591
Do you think that
everybody's gonna play vinyl?

1051
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:40,425
We'll see.

1052
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,760
- [Todd]Grindr went mainstream

1053
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,694
and so did Blue Apron.

1054
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:43,962
That business really took off.

1055
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,163
Blue Apron's established--
- He's got a real skill.

1056
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:46,932
- Partnerships with over 150

1057
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:47,899
local farms.
- [Gary] He's really good.

1058
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:48,733
- [Pat] Best in the game.

1059
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:49,568
- I was wondering--
- And raised across--

1060
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:50,869
- why he was here.
- the United States.

1061
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,804
(group laughter)

1062
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,239
- The beef,
chicken and pork come

1063
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,141
from responsibly raised animals.

1064
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,742
Those are
responsibly raised animals.

1065
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,277
They have both parents.

1066
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,513
Their produce is
sourced from farms

1067
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:04,115
that practice regenerative
farming, that's important

1068
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,251
and Blue Apron
ships the exact amount

1069
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:08,353
of each ingredient
required for recipe.

1070
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:10,355
They're reducing food waste.

1071
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,391
Also key, impact on
households cooking together,

1072
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:14,860
build strong families.

1073
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,694
- Yes.
- [Todd]Right.

1074
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:16,528
- We love families.

1075
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:18,029
- No more (inaudible).
- [Pat] No Maury Povich.

1076
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,165
- [Todd]Right, research shows
that Blue Apron families

1077
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,833
cook nearly
three times more often

1078
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,402
and are 80% less
likely to produce children

1079
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,037
that grow up to
be serial killers.

1080
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,740
- Household--
- [Digs]Is that an actual stat?

1081
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,574
- [Todd]Let's call it that.

1082
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:30,842
- [Nick]Digs and I
cook together all the time

1083
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,711
and we are not
producing any children

1084
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:33,545
or serial killers.

1085
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:34,579
- [Pat] I think you should
think about it by the way.

1086
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:35,547
- Do you guys cook together?

1087
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:35,981
- [Digs]Yep.

1088
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:36,848
- [Nick]You guys
should adopt a kid.

1089
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,317
- You guys should
start your own vlog

1090
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,418
about you guys cooking

1091
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:41,519
- [Digs]Oh that's great.

1092
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,787
- and take over Pat.
- [Todd]That's one way

1093
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,656
- Take over Pat.
- [Todd]to be less sincere but

1094
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:45,991
- [Digs]You should.
- [Todd]I like that.

1095
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:47,859
- I'm about to
encourage these guys.

1096
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,994
Coup d'etat, guys, coup d'etat.

1097
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:50,328
- [Pat] Hold on,
I did a whole speech

1098
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,463
at a company last week

1099
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:53,565
and I didn't know if I
was supposed to motivate them

1100
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:55,367
to take the person in
front of them's job or not,

1101
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,268
who's in the room.

1102
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:57,102
- Yeah.
- [Pat] And that's basically

1103
00:33:57,102 --> 00:33:58,236
what I did.
- I do that all the time.

1104
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,572
I basically try to
get everybody to quit.

1105
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:02,073
I get paid hundreds
of thousands of dollars

1106
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,608
to speak at a corporate retreat

1107
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:04,976
and then I'm
like, "Get outta here."

1108
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,345
and then the bosses
are like why did we?

1109
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,447
Sorry, I gotta a talk about.
- Don't quit, Todd.

1110
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,081
- [Pat] Don't quit
on these ad reads guys.

1111
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:12,650
- Go ahead.
- [Todd]My favorite

1112
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,753
is the spice hot tacos.
- So smart, by the way.

1113
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:17,455
- It comes with 12 tortillas,
almost a pound and a half

1114
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,991
of cod, Greek yogurt,
lime, avocado, cucumber,

1115
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:24,596
lettuce, peanuts,
cabbage and cotija cheese.

1116
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:25,697
- [Pat] That's my favorite.

1117
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:26,531
- [Todd]Am I
pronouncing that correctly?

1118
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,399
- I have no idea what
the hell you just said.

1119
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,733
- [Pat] That's you're a
sophisticated fucking palate.

1120
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,601
- No, no, no, no.

1121
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:30,435
- I just don't know it.
- Can you spell it for me?

1122
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,804
- [Todd]C-O-T-I-J-A.

1123
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,572
- [Digs]Oh that's cotiya.

1124
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,806
- [Gary] Is that true?
- No.

1125
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:39,043
- [Todd]It's Russian, we
think you should know that.

1126
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,812
- That's Russian for penis.

1127
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:41,846
(group laughter)

1128
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,481
- [Digs]Cheese.
- [Pat] Penis cheese.

1129
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,417
- When some people
hear BlueApron.com,

1130
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,418
they think it's gonna be
a company that sells aprons

1131
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,954
that are blue, which is stupid

1132
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:50,455
because you can't
just sell blue aprons,

1133
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,422
that business would fail.

1134
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,326
You have to sell all the colors.

1135
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:55,460
- Niches win.

1136
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,094
- [Todd]So when you
think BlueApron.com,

1137
00:34:57,094 --> 00:34:58,396
I want you to think of a company

1138
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,497
that sell delicious healthy,

1139
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,900
environmentally
responsible meal kits.

1140
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,435
They're affordable
and easy to make

1141
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,736
because that's what they are.

1142
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:07,739
They're affordable for the less
than $10 per person per meal

1143
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:09,841
Blue Apron
delivers seasonal recipes

1144
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,576
along with
pre-portioned ingredients

1145
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,078
to make
delicious home-cooked meals

1146
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:13,979
and they're easy.

1147
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:15,313
Each meal comes
with a step by step,

1148
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,248
easy to follow recipe card.

1149
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:18,616
Call to action, guys.

1150
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,552
Let's really around this.
- [Pat] This is what we need.

1151
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:21,586
- [Todd]This
is what it's about.

1152
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:22,687
This is what the whole
- [Pat] We need another.

1153
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:23,521
- [Todd]read is about.

1154
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:24,756
- [Pat] We need another page.

1155
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:27,525
- [Todd]We need a
whole 'nother page.

This is what's
important for our listeners.

1157
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:30,996
Everything else
we said is important.

1158
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:32,397
This is the most important.

00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:33,932

1169
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:58,990
- [Man]
Spell it for him.

1170
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,058
- [Pat] It's P as
in pterodactyl,

1171
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:02,661
a as in apple, t as in tsunami.

1172
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:03,995
Next question Gary.

1173
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,265
- I wanna talk to the
audience, real quick audience,

1174
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,501
let's start a campaign
right now for Blue Apron.

1175
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,769
I'm gonna do it right now.

1176
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:15,540
Go to Twitter and
let's start #onepagepat.

1177
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,142
(group laughter)

1178
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:20,245
Let's prove to Blue Apron
that first of all,

1179
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:22,647
I love how you're
natively integrating the ad.

1180
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:23,348
- [Todd]Thank you.

1181
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:27,285
- But that ad is way
too long, way too long.

1182
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:30,321
No I got it, and
Blue Apron's very smart

1183
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:32,490
or their ad company's very
smart to be sponsoring this.

1184
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,792
Very smart, it's a deal.

1185
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,093
Whatever you're charging,
not enough.

1186
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:37,562
I'm being dead serious.
- [Pat] I agree.

1187
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,964
I found out what the
numbers are yesterday.

1188
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:40,999
- But here's
what we're gonna do.

1189
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:42,200
We're gonna help everybody.

1190
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,769
We're gonna help you,
we're gonna help you

1191
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,105
and we're gonna
really help Blue Apron.

1192
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:52,343
#onepagepat, if you
want it to go to one page

1193
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,546
and you're committed
to supporting Blue Apron,

1194
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,815
because you don't want to listen
to that horse shit anymore

1195
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:59,017
and you'd rather get two
more minutes of the podcast

1196
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:00,719
so you'll just do
what Blue Apron wants

1197
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,353
which is do this thing,

1198
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,855
but it has to
now go to one page.

1199
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:06,124
I hope that Blue Apron's
CEO and all their executives

1200
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:07,859
are listening and their VCs.

1201
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:11,329
That is way too
long and so I'm convinced

1202
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,698
that thousands of
people here will actually

1203
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:17,635
do the Blue Apron thing to
make it one page, #onepagepat.

1204
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:18,636
- [Todd]We love you,
Blue Apron,

1205
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:19,804
but it doesn't
need to be three pages.

1206
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:20,839
Don't send us three pages.

1207
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,140
- [Pat] That was unbelievable.

1208
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,442
- I've lost all my
energy, I'm finished.

1209
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,678
Watch this, 
go ahead, next question.

1210
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:28,580
- [Pat] So what I was thinking
was,

1211
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,181
I'm in a
relationship with a lady.

1212
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,149
- I don't know.

1213
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:32,417
- [Pat] Is it
possible to build an empire

1214
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,685
and be in a relationship?

1215
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:35,820
- No, you should break up.

1216
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,324
- [Pat] Seems like
Blue Apron's really killed you.

1217
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:40,925
- Are you in a relationship?
- [Pat] I am yeah.

1218
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,393
- It's super hard.
- [Pat] It is very hard.

1219
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:45,063
- How old are you again?
- [Pat] 29.

1220
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:45,997
- Listen, do you love her?

1221
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,031
- [Pat] Yeah
I'm a big fan of her.

1222
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,600
- And how long
have you been together?

1223
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,534
- [Pat] Like a
year, we've known each other

1224
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:50,368
for a long time though.

1225
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,302
- Oh you're gonna marry her.

1226
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,370
- [Pat] Probably.
- Okay, well, that's cool.

1227
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,371
- [Pat] Is
it possible though?

1228
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:55,573
We've been through some battles
here the last couple months.

1229
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,175
- Easy, it's very easy.

1230
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:59,944
But what you just
said makes it scary,

1231
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:04,849
which is you
need a fullback bro.

1232
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,718
You need somebody
to clear the path.

1233
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:07,418
- [Pat] Yeah, take care

1234
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:08,786
of the home front
right, let me work.

1235
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,955
- You need old school.

1236
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:14,726
When you're hungry,
when you're hungry,

1237
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:17,829
you need old school fullback.

1238
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,597
You need a fullback
or a cheerleader.

1239
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,866
You definitely don't
need a wide receiver.

1240
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:23,968
When you're hungry,
when you're hungry.

1241
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,070
- [Pat] Wow, yeah.

1242
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,006
- And that's self-awareness.

1243
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,474
You need to find
a partner in life,

1244
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,177
this is not, I'm not
trying to be cool or anything.

1245
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:34,112
By the way, this is
the advice I give most

1246
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:37,048
of my female
entrepreneurs that I invest in.

1247
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:40,084
This is not boy advice,
this is human advice.

1248
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,586
You have to know who you are.

1249
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:43,855
- [Digs]Do they get
all the football references?

1250
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:44,923
- Sure, sure.

1251
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,993
I only invest in
female entrepreneurs

1252
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,128
that know
everything about football.

1253
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:51,462
I'm like what's a gunner?

1254
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:54,265
They're like uhh.
(group laughter)

1255
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,234
By the way, 98%
of dudes don't know

1256
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:57,468
what a fucking gunner is.

1257
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:58,303
- [Pat] Yeah,
you're obviously right.

1258
00:38:58,303 --> 00:38:58,937
- I'm so pissed.

1259
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:00,572
Anyway, you know what my
favorite football move is?

1260
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:01,940
I'll go back to your answer,

1261
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,442
when the Jets
establish their roster,

1262
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:09,214
I buy the jerseys of
the 45th to 53rd player,

1263
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:11,282
all of them custom.
- [Pat] Respect that.

1264
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,451
- Like Tanner Purdum,
like long snapper, all of them.

1265
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:14,752
And then I wear them.

1266
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,055
Then at the stadium people
come up to me like hey bro,

1267
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:18,423
cool nice jersey,
that's your last name?

1268
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:19,357
I'm like no, dick.

1269
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,026
That's your long snapper.
(group laughter)

1270
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,530
That's basically how
I establish my fandom.

1271
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,565
Anyway, if you're a hard
core fan, that's the move.

1272
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:30,301
Anyway, you need a
fullback or a cheerleader

1273
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,137
because the problem is,
when you're hungry,

1274
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,039
you only have one gear.

1275
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,507
If you don't have
somebody supporting that

1276
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:39,410
by clearing the
way or cheering for it,

1277
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,979
it's gonna create friction.
- [Pat] Yeah.

1278
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:42,380
- The end.

1279
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,448
- [Pat] And you have a
lady you've been

1280
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:44,349
with for a long time.

1281
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:45,750
- 13 years and Lizzie's like

1282
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,952
the only reason I'm
pulling off this shit.

1283
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,088
- [Pat] I think that's
what Sam's becoming though.

1284
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:52,490
Her and I, the
transition into this,

1285
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,693
the whole barstool sports
busy all the fucking time.

1286
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:56,895
We are busy all the time,

1287
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,429
more busy than I
ever was in the NFL.

1288
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:59,297
- Right it was so much cooler

1289
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:01,933
to be like my husband's a
NFL football player, right?

1290
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:03,301
Or my boyfriend's
an NFL football player,

1291
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:05,870
instead of like my
boyfriend's a podcaster.

1292
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,440
- [Pat] Well, I don't
know if she says that or not.

1293
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,775
I have no idea, if she's--

1294
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,110
- She says it.
- [Pat] You think so?

1295
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,211
- Yeah.

1296
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:14,579
- [Pat] I don't think
she's said her boyfriend's a--

1297
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,814
- What's up with your boyfriend?

1298
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,249
Oh he's a former NFL player.

1299
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,484
- [Todd]Yeah, that's
guaranteed what happens.

1300
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:21,653
- That's money in the bank.
- [Pat] I don't think so,

1301
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:22,787
I think Sam's a--

1302
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,822
- Wait hold on,
this is your homie crew.

1303
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,025
We're doing an official vote.
We're doing an official vote.

1304
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:28,993
You go, Digs.

1305
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,695
- [Digs]I think she
says former NFL player.

1306
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:31,462
- Good next?

1307
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,398
- [Nick]Yeah, absolutely.
- Yep, next.

1308
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:34,866
- [Todd]I say she says
comedian.

1309
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:37,302
- Next? 
- [Man 4] Yeah, no NFL.

1310
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:38,736
- Comedian, two for two.

1311
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:40,238
- [Pat] She's a
pretty big fan of the comedy.

1312
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:43,808
- Here's the punchline,
two really good friends.

1313
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:46,244
- Two people you gotta
keep your eye on. (laughs)

1314
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:47,412
- [Digs]Two guys that
wanna be single. (laughs)

1315
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:48,413
- Two guys that are about to
start their--

1316
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:49,614
- [Digs]No no, they don't like--

1317
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:50,915
- Hey I'm very thankful for Sam,

1318
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,583
because I make
this joke all the time,

1319
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:53,685
- We don't want
him to be single.

1320
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:56,254
we could not handle
your undivided attention.

1321
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:58,656
- [Digs]Single Pat
is a nightmare for us.

1322
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:01,693
'Cause his brain
does not fucking stop.

1323
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:03,695
- [Pat] Late night
texts late night calls,

1324
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:04,729
hey that's what I am thinking.

1325
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:06,731
- You can't out
intensify me bro,

1326
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:09,233
let's just be friends.
- [Digs]I believe that,

1327
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,735
- Like, we'll try.

1328
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:13,504
- [Pat] You're drinking coffee,

1329
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:14,839
I drank total war this morning.

1330
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,507
- I'm gonna drink four
sips it's comfort food,

1331
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,209
wait until you see how
full it is when I leave.

1332
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,278
I don't need fucking coffee.
I don't need anything.

1333
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:22,447
(laughs)

1334
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:24,182
- [Pat] No I look up to you,

1335
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:25,883
so I'm really
happy you came in here.

1336
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,919
When you reached
out to be on my show,

1337
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:29,287
I've never been more excited.

1338
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:30,722
- [Digs]I'm pretty
fascinated let me tell ya,

1339
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:31,989
sitting in this chair and I'm

1340
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,927
also going to work on my
impression of you. (Gary laughs)

1341
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:39,697
Cool persona that
matches your voice, of ever.

1342
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:42,100
- Thank you very much.
Thank you, number two,

1343
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,601
you are really doing it man,

1344
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,036
like listen I watch everything,

1345
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:47,105
I spent my life
looking at culture,

1346
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,172
and whether it's hip hop,

1347
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,009
and spending time
with Kyle or Russ or Logic,

1348
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,677
or I'm looking at comedians,

1349
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,011
spending a lot of
time looking at that space.

1350
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,313
I look at
everything that's happening

1351
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:58,316
in podcasting, vlogging,
personal brands on Instagram,

1352
00:41:58,316 --> 00:41:59,951
you are really doing this.

1353
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:03,054
And my one massive
piece of advice would be

1354
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:05,490
step on the throat
of this opportunity.

1355
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:08,292
Go harder, this
is a moment in time.

1356
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:09,160
Like, listen.

1357
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,995
It ebbs and flows.
I'm always going

1358
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,231
to be a winner
and I've always won,

1359
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:14,932
but I've been
through three cycles,

1360
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,367
when it was better, right?

1361
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,735
Like I should have
collected more emails,

1362
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:19,437
and did more Google AdWords,
that's how it got

1363
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:20,905
that's how it
got from three to 60,

1364
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:22,940
I was right, I should
have went harder, right.

1365
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,543
YouTube, I was one of
the first people on it,

1366
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:29,480
four months into YouTube,
I should have went harder.

1367
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,849
Twitter I went
hard I got my value.

1368
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,051
Like when you have your moment,

1369
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,285
I have my moment right now,

1370
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,254
I am going hard.

1371
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:37,989
Like I have never worked harder,

1372
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,425
like 6 A.M. to
one in the morning.

1373
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:41,626
This is your moment.

1374
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:44,362
And somebody's
going to watch this,

1375
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:46,497
and I mean this whole
thing that you're doing,

1376
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,499
and they're going
to do the same move.

1377
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:51,736
And they're going to
be cooler than a punter.

1378
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:55,773
I mean it, I mean it, Now
my intuition that might not

1379
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,975
be more talented than you.

1380
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,844
Right, like at this,

1381
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:01,679
But this is a
moment bro you're winning,

1382
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,147
you've got the hearts and minds

1383
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:04,415
of a lot of people.

1384
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,718
You've got real
fucking magic inside of you,

1385
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:11,222
you should be a
guest on every single

1386
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:14,459
top 100 podcast
over the next 120 days.

1387
00:43:14,459 --> 00:43:16,527
- [Pat] I'm ready to run
through a fucking wall right now

1388
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:19,063
(gropu laughter)

1389
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:20,131
- [Digs]I'm glad
you had that idea,

1390
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:21,365
because we had that same idea.

1391
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,100
- [Todd]Just gotta
go on a pod run right?

1392
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,802
- [Pat] No one
knows who the fuck I am.

1393
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:28,139
- Listen a lot do, but you
need to go cross pollinate,

1394
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:29,440
you resonate with everybody.

1395
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,311
This isn't, listen this
is one man's point of view.

1396
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:34,779
This isn't the cliche
thing that I think that

1397
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,047
a lot of people are thinking

1398
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:38,449
which is like, oh
good, he's hit the hole,

1399
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,619
middle America,
Arkansas Rick demo,

1400
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,021
dude you are an
authentic human being,

1401
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:46,123
you'll win with
41-year-old females,

1402
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,326
you'll win with
22-year-old Latinos,

1403
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:51,195
in San Antonio.
(Pat speaks Spanish)

1404
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:52,497
You'll just win.

1405
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:54,298
You need to go hack culture.

1406
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,100
What that means is
you need more awareness,

1407
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,069
and exposure and
not just the niche,

1408
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:00,238
that comes to you which
means you gotta go work.

1409
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:03,374
You gotta go show up on shit.

1410
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:04,842
You gotta go reach out to vlogs.

1411
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:05,710
- [Pat] How the
fuck do we get there?

1412
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,211
Like we have no idea how to--

1413
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:08,579
- I'll tell you!

1414
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:09,380
- [Pat] Awesome.

1415
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,748
- Not only will I tell you,

1416
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,950
I'll let you take
an employee or two,

1417
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,318
from VaynerMedia,
to work for you,

1418
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,586
I'm being dead
serious in what I'm saying,

1419
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:17,722
and by the way this is
not me being Mother Theresa.

1420
00:44:17,722 --> 00:44:18,823
I've got a problem,

1421
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:21,626
I'm creating so much
talent at VaynerMedia,

1422
00:44:21,626 --> 00:44:22,894
that I can't
feed them all, like,

1423
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:24,495
the companies just not
going to be big enough,

1424
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,297
and a lot of them are winners,

1425
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:29,333
like this is
Barstool the company,

1426
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,203
and you specifically, you know,

1427
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:33,871
we mainly hire people
who are into football.

1428
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:36,374
So I've got unlimited,
I've got kids

1429
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:38,943
that can absolutely
bring you huge value,

1430
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:40,077
or you could
figure it out yourself,

1431
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,045
you got a whole crew here,

1432
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,613
I don't care just do it.

1433
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:44,649
- [Digs]We'll take a
couple guys. (laughs)

1434
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:47,018
- [Pat] We have a
couple guys that we signed.

1435
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,153
That we've had
to fire immediately.

1436
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:51,489
We had a guy
named Cervix Killer,

1437
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:52,957
that was his nickname,

1438
00:44:52,957 --> 00:44:54,692
I don't know if that's
a good thing or bad thing,

1439
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,060
immediately off the jump,

1440
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,663
but he starts sexually
harassing one of other.

1441
00:44:58,663 --> 00:45:00,698
- [Digs]He tried to
kill the wrong cervix.

1442
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,233
Which you
know is out of character,

1443
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:03,534
for a guy that
shows up in the interview

1444
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,404
wearing a cervix
killer T shirt. (group laughter)

1445
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:08,573
- [Pat] We expect, but
that would be incredible,

1446
00:45:08,573 --> 00:45:09,507
for future reference.

1447
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:10,341
- You need to hack,

1448
00:45:10,341 --> 00:45:13,110
you need to show up
on vlogs, right like,

1449
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,679
do you know
what's going on YouTube

1450
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:18,182
with all these families that
are vlogging their lives, right?

1451
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,051
So basically like
a reality TV show,

1452
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,552
just like a whole
couple with two kids and like,

1453
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,553
millions of views.

1454
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,654
You need to just show up,

1455
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:24,889
to their house in Ohio,

1456
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,958
and teach the kids
how to play soccer.

1457
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:28,593
Boom, 30,000 more people,

1458
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:30,194
listening to your podcast.

1459
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,762
You need to show
up on Rogan's podcast,

1460
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,531
right, boom explosion.

1461
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:35,700
You need to show up on you know,

1462
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,668
you need to go
and become friendly,

1463
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:39,070
with some hip hop artists.

1464
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,305
Rich the Kid, like
1,000,000 followers on Instagram

1465
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:44,208
like you've got it.

1466
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,610
Now, you're
either gonna run hard

1467
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,211
or you're gonna run super hard

1468
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,246
or you're gonna run,
you're running hard.

1469
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,148
Like that's just you.
- [Pat] Yeah.

1470
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:52,683
You want me to go super hard.

1471
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:55,353
- I do, only 'cause you
have a moment right now.

1472
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:57,188
Like you can
literally, like you can be the,

1473
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:58,456
I mean I genuinely
think you're gonna host

1474
00:45:58,456 --> 00:46:00,391
the ESPYs in three years.

1475
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:01,726
- [Pat] Fuck ESPN.

1476
00:46:01,726 --> 00:46:02,560
- Okay.

1477
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,562
(group laughter)

1478
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:06,897
- [Digs]How about we
have our own version of ESPN?

1479
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:07,732
- Yeah.

1480
00:46:07,732 --> 00:46:08,566
- [Male] We create
our own award show?

1481
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:09,367
- [Pat] No, you're right, I
understand what you're saying.

1482
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:10,701
- By the way,
everybody says, "Fuck Facebook,

1483
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:11,402
"it's fucking me."

1484
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:13,070
I'm like, "No, no, no,
you need to fuck it back."

1485
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,972
Take people out of it.

1486
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:17,508
You can say, "Fuck ESPN"
until you go on the ESPYs

1487
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:20,244
and you siphon all those fans.

1488
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:22,279
It's the best to go
into enemy territory.

1489
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,950
I go do interviews with certain
people that I don't love,

1490
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,285
to siphon people out of it.

1491
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,987
- [Pat] Ugh.
- [Todd]Yeah.

1492
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:31,889
- [Pat] Jesus Christ Gary.
- Yep.

1493
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:33,591
- [Pat] Who do I hate, ESPN?

1494
00:46:33,591 --> 00:46:34,592
I gotta go to ESPN.

1495
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:35,593
- [Digs]You
hate a lot of people.

1496
00:46:35,593 --> 00:46:36,494
- [Pat] I hate a lot of people.

1497
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:37,328
- [Digs]Well, we have this
fight with you all the time.

1498
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:38,429
- Andrew Luck. I know
you hate Andrew Luck.

1499
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:39,597
- [Digs]And you have
no trouble running hard.

1500
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:40,731
- I'm just making up shit.

1501
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:41,899
- [Digs]You just don't want
to use the right path to run.

1502
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,669
- I'm just trying to get
headlines. McAfee hates Luck.

1503
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:45,936
- [Pat] That's
what ESPN will run.

1504
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:47,071
- By the way he is an
awesome kid, isn't he?

1505
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:49,573
- [Pat] Incredible.
- He's hungry as fuck.

1506
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:51,108
- [Pat] Unless he
was born an asshole.

1507
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:52,610
- He better win a Super Bowl.

1508
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:53,811
That's like
running through my head.

1509
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,813
I'm like that's gonna
be fun to watch from afar

1510
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,281
'cause I'm a huge
Patrick Ewing fan

1511
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:59,050
and that means
misery loves company

1512
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,651
and I want other
all-time greats to

1513
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,086
not win championships.

1514
00:47:02,086 --> 00:47:02,987
- [Pat] Dan Marino.

1515
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,488
- I hate that fucker.

1516
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,590
- [Pat] How come?
- 'Cause I'm a diehard Jets fan.

1517
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,926
Do you understand?

1518
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:10,161
- [Pat] You're right.

1519
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:13,230
Bro, do you know
how lucky I am that

1520
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,332
the NFL had realignment?

1521
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,768
The NFL realigned
Peyton's rookie year.

1522
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:20,204
The Colts were in
the Jets' division.

1523
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:23,708
It would have been both of them.

1524
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:26,510
That would have been
four automatic losses a year.

1525
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,345
(group laughter)
- [Pat] Unbelievable.

1526
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,381
- Yeah, little fun
fact for the kids at home.

1527
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:31,749
- [Pat] So you legit are a
diehard,

1528
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:33,651
do the Jets know
you are a diehard fan?

1529
00:47:33,651 --> 00:47:35,720
That you plan on buying them?
- Yep.

1530
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,621
- [Pat] What's the owner name?
- Woody Johnson.

1531
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:38,622
- [Pat] Woody Johnson?
- Yep.

1532
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:39,757
- [Pat] Does he know that
you plan on buying from him?

1533
00:47:39,757 --> 00:47:41,826
- I'm not sure. I don't care.

1534
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:44,028
Because he's not selling.

1535
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,863
And I hope he
has a nice long life.

1536
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,364
And I'm 30 years younger,

1537
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,500
and it's the natural progression
of human beings, right?

1538
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,569
- [Pat] I talked to
Jim Irsay in my retirement,

1539
00:47:51,569 --> 00:47:53,604
which was an hour
and a half conversation.

1540
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:54,438
- Interesting.

1541
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:55,573
- [Pat] It was
an incredible convo.

1542
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:58,275
I told him I never
wanted to be a player,

1543
00:47:58,275 --> 00:47:59,710
never want to be a coach,

1544
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,445
don't wanna be a scout,
don't wanna be a GM

1545
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,280
I wanna own the Colts one day.

1546
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,649
And he was like
so taken back by it,

1547
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:07,718
but then he gave me
like a real conversation.

1548
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:08,886
- I love it.

1549
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,421
- [Pat] I think the NFL owners
are getting comfortable.

1550
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:11,956
They're just
getting comfortable.

1551
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:14,191
- Anybody gets comfortable
when you're a billionaire.

1552
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,527
- [Pat] Making billions.
What is the end game for you?

1553
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:18,796
- Seven Super Bowls.

1554
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:20,498
- [Pat] So owning the Jets
and winning seven Super Bowls

1555
00:48:20,498 --> 00:48:21,966
is the end game for GaryVee.

1556
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:24,201
- 100%. And then there
will be a movie, right?

1557
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:26,804
'Cause it was a kid
from Russia who always

1558
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:28,439
said he was gonna
own the Jets and he did

1559
00:48:28,439 --> 00:48:30,608
and I'm gonna
inspire some 13-year-old girl

1560
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:33,110
in Chattanooga, Tennessee
to do something similar.

1561
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,378
- [Pat] Do you
think about your story with

1562
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:35,246
every decision you make?

1563
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:36,614
- Yes.
- [Pat] Me too.

1564
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:37,214
- 100%.

1565
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:38,682
- [Digs]Who plays
you in the movie?

1566
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,518
- Somebody ridiculously
fucking handsome.

1567
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:42,753
(group laughter)

1568
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,523
I don't know if you know this,

1569
00:48:45,523 --> 00:48:48,726
my brother AJ, he
started VaynerMedia with me.

1570
00:48:48,726 --> 00:48:51,162
He left a year and a
half, about a year ago.

1571
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:53,364
He has Crohn's disease.

1572
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:55,132
We went from 30 to 800 people.

1573
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:56,600
And you're managing people.

1574
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,968
And that shit sucks,
you guys know.

1575
00:48:57,968 --> 00:48:59,203
- [Pat] Puttin out fires.

1576
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:00,971
- I'm a firefighter.
I say it all the time.

1577
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,039
That's what I do for a living.

1578
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:03,741
I'm gonna leave this booth,

1579
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:04,575
we're gonna
high-five, new friends,

1580
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:05,810
we're pumped, we like each other

1581
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,778
And literally I'm
gonna open my phone,

1582
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,181
there's gonna be
four texts and 137 emails

1583
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:12,416
and it's all gonna
be shit. That's my life.

1584
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,952
But that's what you do
when you're number one, right?

1585
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,487
Anyway, my brother leaves,

1586
00:49:16,487 --> 00:49:18,088
he doesn't know
what he wants to do,

1587
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:20,724
we decide a
couple months earlier,

1588
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:22,459
I bought a small
sports agency out of

1589
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:25,095
Boston and New York
called Symmetry Sports.

1590
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:26,597
They only had four guys.

1591
00:49:26,597 --> 00:49:29,033
Matt Paradis was their big hit.

1592
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:31,268
Sixth round center from Boise.

1593
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,470
All-pro now for
the Broncos. Great kid.

1594
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,739
Small guys. Couldn't
really ever play at the

1595
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,441
biggest leagues of agency world.

1596
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:38,976
But I wanted to
learn it, so I bought it.

1597
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,678
Passive, just to watch it.

1598
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:42,646
AJ decides to
jump in and run it.

1599
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,548
We rebrand it to VaynerSports,

1600
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:46,951
and I'm about to dominate
over the next five years

1601
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:48,018
the sports agency world.

1602
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:49,186
- [Pat] Do you know
how many agents I've fired?

1603
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:50,354
- How many?
- [Pat] Five.

1604
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:51,188
- True?
- [Pat] Yep.

1605
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:53,757
- Good. I wanna be
able to close every single

1606
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:56,093
punter prospect for the rest
of my life because of you.

1607
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:57,795
- [Pat] That'll be no problem.
- Great.

1608
00:49:57,795 --> 00:50:00,030
- [Pat] I don't wanna say
I'm the leader of the punters

1609
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,999
but every high school kid--

1610
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,968
- You're the
Lord of the Punters.

1611
00:50:03,968 --> 00:50:05,169
- [Digs]I like that.

1612
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:07,771
- You're the
Lord of the Punters.

1613
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:09,807
DRock, new custom t-shirt,
we're doing this.

1614
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:11,242
Lord of the Punters.

1615
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:12,276
- Find it at BarstoolSports.com

1616
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:14,211
(group laughter)

1617
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:15,346
- [Gary] Extra large?
Extra large.

1618
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:19,750
- [Pat] Yeah.
- Lord of the Punters.

1619
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:20,584
- [Pat] I think that's a goal.

1620
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:22,253
- If there's a single punter in,

1621
00:50:22,253 --> 00:50:23,888
not this draft coming up,
next year's draft,

1622
00:50:23,888 --> 00:50:26,857
that gets drafted, that doesn't
sign with VaynerSports--

1623
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,158
- [Pat] My fault.
- we're losers.

1624
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:29,526
No, you know what,
you're right, your fault.

1625
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,694
- [Pat] Yeah,
it's 100% my fault.

1626
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:31,528
But it's very easy to tell

1627
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,496
which punter's gonna make it

1628
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:33,464
and which
kicker's gonna make it.

1629
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:34,298
- Great.

1630
00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:35,466
- [Pat] In the
college, very easy.

1631
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:36,433
Got a gigantic leg?

1632
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:37,601
Gonna make it.

1633
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:38,435
Baby leg?

1634
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:39,270
Not gonna make it.

1635
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,371
Easy as that.

1636
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:41,739
I happen to have
the biggest of them all.

1637
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:43,207
(group laughter)

1638
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:45,676
- That just gave us a design
idea for Lord of the Punters.

1639
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:47,912
- [Pat] Gigantic fucking leg.
- Gigantic leg.

1640
00:50:47,912 --> 00:50:48,746
I love it.

1641
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:49,680
- [Pat] Do you
follow other sports?

1642
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,048
NHL?
- NBA.

1643
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,349
I was a big hockey fan,

1644
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,718
but once my teams win
a championship, I'm out.

1645
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,287
So the '94 Rangers win the cup?

1646
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:57,888
- [Pat] Climb that, out.
- That's it.

1647
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,056
I'm all about the climb.

1648
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,891
Once I win, I'm out.

1649
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,526
- [Pat] But you want seven
championships with the Jets.

1650
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:03,961
Don't you think
that the history of you,

1651
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:04,962
is gonna make you drop out,

1652
00:51:04,962 --> 00:51:06,730
after you won a
Super Bowl as an owner?

1653
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,032
- Maybe.

1654
00:51:08,032 --> 00:51:09,199
That's a very good observation.

1655
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,434
You know what
I'm more scared of?

1656
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:12,803
Actually winning
one before I buy them.

1657
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,438
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

1658
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:15,673
It could get fucked up.

1659
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:16,807
- [Digs]It makes
for a better movie

1660
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,342
if you just
leave after that one,

1661
00:51:18,342 --> 00:51:20,177
'cause it would
get kinda redundant.

1662
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:21,011
(Pat laughs)

1663
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:22,246
You're going seven wins.

1664
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:23,213
- [Todd]I don't
think you have to worry

1665
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:24,448
about them winning one.

1666
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:25,816
- Yeah, that's
what everybody says

1667
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,518
until they go 2-14 this year,

1668
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:29,653
take Darnold,
right, from USC next year,

1669
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:31,589
and go and actually win.

1670
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:33,857
Listen, I love losing.

1671
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:34,725
- [Pat] You learn.

1672
00:51:34,725 --> 00:51:35,559
- I love losing.

1673
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:38,195
All these people, I
love all these Patriot fans,

1674
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:39,196
friends I have, right?

1675
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:42,066
Who live in other parts,
listen, you live in Boston?

1676
00:51:42,066 --> 00:51:42,900
Mazel Tov.

1677
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,401
New Hampshire, Vermont?

1678
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:45,436
Mazel Tov.

1679
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:48,439
You live in fucking Detroit,
and you're a Patriots fan?

1680
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,274
It's the quickest
tell that you're a loser.

1681
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,875
You're using.
(group laughter)

1682
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:53,177
You are using, it is!

1683
00:51:53,177 --> 00:51:54,411
And by the way, I'm not joking.

1684
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:57,581
If you are a fan of a
great sports franchise

1685
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:59,249
and you do not
live in that market,

1686
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:01,185
let me tell you who you are.

1687
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:02,653
You're a fucking loser.

1688
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:03,854
Let me explain.

1689
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:06,657
It's because you
need an outside thing

1690
00:52:06,657 --> 00:52:08,225
to give you self-esteem.

1691
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:11,462
You want other people to deploy
self-esteem into your body,

1692
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:13,263
you don't have it yourself.

1693
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:14,264
Period.

1694
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:16,700
- [Pat] Do you read
tweets that are compliments?

1695
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,168
- Of course!

1696
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:19,269
- [Pat] You love 'em.

1697
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,805
- I need compliments 24/7/365.

1698
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:22,773
- [Pat] Me too,
I fucking love 'em.

1699
00:52:22,773 --> 00:52:23,607
- They're my oxygen.

1700
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:25,075
- [Pat] I would take a
compliment from anybody.

1701
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:26,477
- And I also love fucking,

1702
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:27,778
"GaryVee, you're
a bullshit artist,

1703
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:28,712
"I don't believe
anything you say."

1704
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:29,546
I love that too.

1705
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:30,381
Chips on shoulder.

1706
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:32,049
You don't understand,
I'm unbeatable.

1707
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:33,150
You give me compliments?

1708
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,551
I grow, I fucking love it.

1709
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:36,020
You fucking diss my shit?

1710
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:39,490
I fucking grow, 'cause I
want to slice your throat.

1711
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,724
- [Pat] I feel like I'm
looking in a mirror right now.

1712
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:43,527
(group laughter)

1713
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:45,829
But, right?
It's a win-win.

1714
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,265
When you're in a good place,
when you know your intent,

1715
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:51,468
when you've figured
yourself out, it's game over.

1716
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:52,569
- [Pat] How many years
is it gonna take for you

1717
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:53,537
to buy the Jets you think?

1718
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:54,505
Have you mapped it out yet?

1719
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,339
- 20.

1720
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,907
- [Pat] 20 more
years of darkness?

1721
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:58,709
- Yeah, because
I don't do things

1722
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:00,711
that create the
kind of wealth overnight.

1723
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:02,212
I'm not inventing Uber.

1724
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:03,313
- [Pat] You're chess,
not checkers.

1725
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:04,748
- 100%

1726
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:06,784
- [Pat] I learned that
in bool, the other day.

1727
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:07,751
- It's true.

1728
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:10,287
I use that analogy all the
time, that's exactly what I am.

1729
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:13,157
I'm patient as fuck,
I like the narrative,

1730
00:53:13,157 --> 00:53:15,092
I enjoy the climb.

1731
00:53:15,092 --> 00:53:16,460
It's great.

1732
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,561
- [Pat] Just a hustler.

1733
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:20,230
- Just a grinder,
just willing to,

1734
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,801
I think I can
outwill everybody.

1735
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:24,668
- [Pat] Jesus Christ.

1736
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:27,404
- [Digs] You said that, you
willed Xavier into winning the--

1737
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:28,305
- [Pat] I did.

1738
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:29,540
Did you hear about
the Bud Light Busters?

1739
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,175
- Nope.

1740
00:53:31,175 --> 00:53:32,242
- [Pat] So Bud Light
Busters was something

1741
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:33,577
that Barstool Sports together,

1742
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:35,612
they got paid by
Bud Light, I did not.

1743
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:38,982
But everybody, every personality
in the Barstool Sports,

1744
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:42,519
drafted one team that
was seeded nine or lower,

1745
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,721
and you had to pick a
team that made it to Sweet 16.

1746
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,123
- And you took...

1747
00:53:46,123 --> 00:53:46,957
- [Pat] And I took Xavier.

1748
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:47,791
- [Todd] Only team to do it.

1749
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,359
- [Pat] Only team to
make it in the whole company.

1750
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,260
- Do you know what I call this?

1751
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,161
- [Pat] I willed the fuck,

1752
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:53,163
I motivated the
shit out of those kids.

1753
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:54,164
- Do you know what I call this?

1754
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:55,199
- [Pat] What's that?

1755
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:57,935
- The Jorge Cantu rule.

1756
00:53:57,935 --> 00:53:59,636
- [Pat] Okay, don't know who
he is, sounds like a Mexican,

1757
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:00,504
let's do it.

1758
00:54:00,504 --> 00:54:02,873
- Jorge Cantu is
a baseball player,

1759
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:04,608
who was a non-prospect.

1760
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:06,577
I picked him up on waivers,

1761
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:09,146
in Fantasy Baseball,
a decade or two ago.

1762
00:54:09,146 --> 00:54:10,581
He lost his mind.

1763
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:14,118
The guy batted like
.290 with 30 homers.

1764
00:54:14,118 --> 00:54:15,652
He lost his shit.

1765
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:17,287
Had 100 plus RBIs,

1766
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:20,491
came out of left
field, right, literally.

1767
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:21,425
Cool.

1768
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:22,659
I then trade 'em,

1769
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:25,429
because his max value,
he's out of his mind.

1770
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,164
Shits the bed.

1771
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:29,133
Can't play baseball anymore.

1772
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:31,368
I pick him back
up, dominates Earth.

1773
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:32,202
(group laughter)

1774
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:33,804
- [Todd] Back in the game!

1775
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:34,638
- Back in the game!

1776
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:37,074
If Brandon Warnecke is
listening to this right now.

1777
00:54:37,074 --> 00:54:38,242
It happened yesterday.

1778
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:40,310
I pick up Benoit,
the fucking closer,

1779
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,079
the set-up man for the Phillies?

1780
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,381
An hour later, new closer,

1781
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:46,517
it's supposed to be the
set-up guy, nope, Benoit.

1782
00:54:46,517 --> 00:54:47,518
I willed it.

1783
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:49,019
- [Pat] How good do
you feel about that?

1784
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:49,853
- The best.

1785
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:50,687
- [Pat] 'Cause I felt
real good about Xavier.

1786
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:51,522
- The best!

1787
00:54:51,522 --> 00:54:52,356
- [Pat] I celebrated
hard in Vegas.

1788
00:54:52,356 --> 00:54:54,792
- Bro, I honestly believe it.

1789
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:56,393
I know it makes
no logical sense.

1790
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:58,996
I know 10,000 people
just said, "This fucking guy."

1791
00:54:58,996 --> 00:55:00,664
I'm sorry, I believe it.

1792
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:03,100
- [Pat] Do you speak
things into existence?

1793
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,002
- Listen, I think
the answer is yes

1794
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:06,803
because then I go
do something about it.

1795
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,172
- [Digs]It puts
pressure on you.

1796
00:55:08,172 --> 00:55:09,606
- You know what I mean?
Like, I don't sit on my couch

1797
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:11,508
and say, "I'm going
to be a millionaire!"

1798
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:14,044
and then jerk-off while
I'm playing Madden all day.

1799
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:15,779
Like, I say, "I'm going
to be a millionaire,"

1800
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:17,047
And then I got work 20...

1801
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:20,017
- [Digs]That's a good time too.
- No, that's super fun!

1802
00:55:20,017 --> 00:55:21,818
- [Digs]It does put
pressure on yourself

1803
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,020
'cause if you run
your mouth about it...

1804
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:23,854
- [Pat] You gotta do it.

1805
00:55:23,854 --> 00:55:25,322
- [Todd]Then you
gotta back it up with your...

1806
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,090
- Listen, this has been funny
theme the past couple of days,

1807
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,792
I keep pointing to
DRock 'cause he follows me,

1808
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:31,094
he knows everything
that's been going on.

1809
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:32,529
We, we...

1810
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:35,399
Well, his name's David Rock.
I mean, did he win, or what?

1811
00:55:35,399 --> 00:55:36,667
(group laughter)

1812
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:37,501
If my name were...

1813
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,570
- I would want, like, The Rock

1814
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:43,140
- If my name was David Rock,
I'd be seven times bigger.

1815
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,641
(group laughter)

1816
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:45,475
It's true.

1817
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:48,011
Anyway. You know, like, look.

1818
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,781
Muhammad Ali runs
his fucking mouth,

1819
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:53,684
he executes, and
he's the greatest.

1820
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,319
- [Digs]Right.

1821
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:56,753
You know, all the people that
I can't mention right now

1822
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:57,988
that ran their mouth,

1823
00:55:57,988 --> 00:56:00,224
people in the
neighborhood make fun of them.

1824
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:02,559
I mean, it's very basic. I'm
not scared to run my mouth,

1825
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,262
and I do. I'm running my
mouth that I'm going to buy

1826
00:56:05,262 --> 00:56:07,030
a $4 billion thing.

1827
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,565
- [Pat] Yeah, but
it puts pressure on you

1828
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:09,399
to fucking do it.

1829
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:11,768
- I laugh with my inner
circle, I say shit like,

1830
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:15,205
"Man, I could literally end
up becoming a billionaire,

1831
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,774
"and get shit on because
I didn't accomplish it."

1832
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:19,276
(group laughter)

1833
00:56:19,276 --> 00:56:21,011
Like, first dude ever
that like's the worst...

1834
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:22,779
I'm like the
Worst Billionaire Ever.

1835
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:23,914
(group laughter)

1836
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:24,748
- [Pat] You remember Gary saying

1837
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:26,250
he was gonna
buy the fucking Jets.

1838
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,618
- What a loser!

1839
00:56:27,618 --> 00:56:28,652
(group laughter)

1840
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:30,787
- [Pat] All he got
was a billion dollars

1841
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:31,955
before you fuckin'...

1842
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:34,391
- He just owns the
Bangals, that loser.

1843
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:34,891
(group laughter)

1844
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,661
- [Digs]He owns an 
Arena Leauge team.

1845
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:39,630
- [Pat] What's the
next sport to be big, lacrosse?

1846
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,632
- E-sports.
E-sports is going to be

1847
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:45,435
the biggest sport in
America besides the NFL and NBA.

1848
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:47,137
- [Pat] Well, why don't
you put together this league,

1849
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:48,171
because this is an idea.

1850
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:49,006
- Go ahead.

1851
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:51,575
- [Digs]So, in England,
whenever we played over there,

1852
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:53,443
don't know why, but the NFL...

1853
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:55,345
pigs get fed,
hogs get slaughtered,

1854
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:57,047
you're trying to
spread to Europe, whatever.

1855
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:58,582
Don't know how
it's going to work

1856
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:01,051
if they put a team over
there. Won't work, whatever.

1857
00:57:01,051 --> 00:57:03,253
But they have,
for the UEFA League...

1858
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,087
- Yep.

1859
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,589
- [Pat] They have an E
game team that represents

1860
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:07,691
each one of 'em, and the
night before they play...

1861
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:08,525
- FIFA.

1862
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,327
- [Pat] They play
FIFA against each other.

1863
00:57:10,327 --> 00:57:12,496
Why doesn't the NFL have
Madden teams that do that?

1864
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:13,997
Why don't you put that together?

1865
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:15,899
- I don't want to do
anything that's at the mercy

1866
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:17,934
of the IP of somebody else.

1867
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,070
It's the macro-version
of what you didn't like.

1868
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:20,904
I will never do that

1869
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:23,106
because I don't need
to fuck with the shield.

1870
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,274
- [Gary] Gotcha.
- Got it?

1871
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,376
I'd rather create
the hacky sack league,

1872
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:27,678
or the thumb wrestling league,

1873
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:29,179
or the pencil fighting league.

1874
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:31,748
Something that's agnostic
that I can completely own.

1875
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:33,216
That's why.
- [Pat] Gotcha.

1876
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:35,185
- It's literally the macro
of what you said earlier.

1877
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:36,653
- [Pat] And the NFL will
probably end up doing this

1878
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:38,455
at some point, but
they'll be 10 years behind.

1879
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,957
- Yeah, the thing that
people make a mistake on

1880
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:42,225
with social media is
they do things, shady stuff,

1881
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:44,194
but Facebook... and
they think they're tricking

1882
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:46,697
Facebook and Instagram.
They know what's going on.

1883
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:48,231
- [Pat] How do we
get better at Facebook?

1884
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:50,434
- You actually know the
art and the science behind

1885
00:57:50,434 --> 00:57:51,535
how to get better at it.

1886
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:52,769
Like, first of all,

1887
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:55,038
you should never do a podcast
again without it being filmed.

1888
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:55,872
Ever.

1889
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:56,807
- [Group] We film it, yeah.

1890
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,742
- Great. Then, you
should cut at least

1891
00:57:58,742 --> 00:58:03,113
13 to 20 different moments
into 40, 50, 60 second videos,

1892
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:04,915
and then you
should amplify them.

1893
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:07,384
You should run $100 to
$500 worth of ads

1894
00:58:07,384 --> 00:58:11,855
on every single post on
Facebook against Colt fans.

1895
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:13,290
You should compound it.

1896
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:15,359
It's the actual
hashtags you use.

1897
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,728
It's the actual filter you use.

1898
00:58:17,728 --> 00:58:19,629
It's the time that you post it.

1899
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:21,164
- [Pat] Man,
what times are best?

1900
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,699
You don't have to tell
us, don't tell us that.

1901
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:23,600
- No, no. I'll tell you

1902
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,768
'cause I want
everybody at home to win.

1903
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:26,236
I don't know.

1904
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:27,137
But you've gotta do...

1905
00:58:27,137 --> 00:58:28,438
- [Pat] What the
fuck just happened?

1906
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,406
- Well, I'll
tell you what happens.

1907
00:58:29,406 --> 00:58:30,674
All of them could work,
it's different shit.

1908
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,642
Your demo, I think
late nights are interesting,

1909
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:33,810
I think Instagram's interesting,

1910
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,645
I think you have to have
a real Snapchat campaign,

1911
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:37,814
you should never do an
event ever again without

1912
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:39,816
buying a custom filter
that's funny with a drawing

1913
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:41,084
of your face on it.

1914
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:43,420
There's a lot of
strategies here, man.

1915
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,155
- [Digs]God. Jesus.

1916
00:58:45,155 --> 00:58:46,690
- This is not by
accident. This is...

1917
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,760
You're relying
right now on your talent.

1918
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,463
You need to deploy real
strategy to compound it.

1919
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,799
- [Pat] Well,
with that being said...

1920
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:57,868
- Let's go fucking do something.

1921
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:59,703
- [Pat] Let's
go take over the world!

1922
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,238
Let's go take
over the world, Gary.

1923
00:59:01,238 --> 00:59:03,473
- And speaking of taking over
the world, Blue Apron, no...

1924
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:05,008
(group laughter)

1925
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:06,176
- [Pat] Do you
have any more?

1926
00:59:06,176 --> 00:59:07,511
- [Todd]I do not.

1927
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:09,846
- [Pat] Perfect.
The NHL playoffs start tonight.

1928
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:11,214
Who plays, Nick?

1929
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,950
- [Nick] We got the
Pens playing Columbus.

1930
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:14,785
- [Pat] Pens win.

1931
00:59:14,785 --> 00:59:15,752
- [Nick] You think?
- [Pat] Yeah.

1932
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:16,586
- [Nick] Let's hope so.

1933
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:17,754
- [Pat] Pens are gonna win
it,

1934
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:19,656
only because I'm from
Pittsburgh, and I'm a very...

1935
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:20,490
- I gotta go.

1936
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:22,159
- [Pat] Yeah, so...
- I have a meeting.

1937
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:24,161
- [Pat] Go ahead, man.
- Facebook.com/Gary.

1938
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:26,797
Gary V-E-E. On everything else.

1939
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:28,799
I'll answer any
fucking question,

1940
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,333
just put #PatandGary.

1941
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,803
All of them. I'm gonna
answer every fucking question.

1942
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:34,004
- [Pat] I can't wait to
just ask you a hundred...

1943
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:35,972
(group laughter)

1944
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:37,340
- I love you guys.
Thanks everyone. Take care.

1945
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,942
(group applause)

1946
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:40,010
Real pleasure.

1947
00:59:40,010 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Pat] You're the fucking man.
- [Gary] That was fun.
