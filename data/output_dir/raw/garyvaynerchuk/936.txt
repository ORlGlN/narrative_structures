00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you the season</font>

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,600
prediction which is the big one and so

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,160
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that for the last four</font>

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,170
years NFL<font color="#E5E5E5"> seasons I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been very</font>

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,599
pessimistic and have predicted the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jets</font>

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,030
not to make the playoffs<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 and 11</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 and</font>

7
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,620
10 I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been very down it's the one</font>

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,059
place where I'm not a true optimist

9
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,270
however I have newfound light for this

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,029
season I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> very excited I'm a big</font>

11
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,220
believer in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the coach bowls that's</font>

12
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,769
Patrick demeanor and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think chris ivory</font>

13
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:27,359
is one of the grossly underestimated

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,789
running backs in the NFL and so I think

15
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the New York Jets are gonna go ten</font>

16
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,130
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> six and here's why because i think</font>

17
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,350
the buffalo bills are the most grossly

18
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,540
overrated team in the NFL everybody's

19
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,520
buying into the hyperbole I am

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely blown away by people's belief</font>

21
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,820
that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to the playoffs and</font>

22
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,980
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna win nine or ten games it's</font>

23
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,920
a five and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11 teen they stink and we're</font>

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,230
gonna find those openings of victory we

25
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,879
lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> some games along the way I know</font>

26
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,469
that most people have the Jets at five

27
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,329
and 11 6 and 10 I know the most

28
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,609
optimistic have us at nine and seven I'm

29
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,129
going all in on this team I feel it I

30
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,438
feel it in a big way<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and six I</font>

31
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,210
recognize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put myself out there</font>

32
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,850
but i believe baby i believe the

33
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,479
prediction is heartache feel I feel like

34
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jets are gonna end up really strong but</font>

35
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,080
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> very worried about the Steelers and</font>

36
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,780
the Chiefs running the table and when

37
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,670
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't Doug double-digit games and</font>

38
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,170
you don't make the playoffs that's

39
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,850
heartache I don't know if you guys know

40
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,380
that but that's heartache to me that's

41
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,700
the ultimate heartache

42
00:01:30,700 --> 00:00:00,000
you
