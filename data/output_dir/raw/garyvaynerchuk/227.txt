00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:03,335
♫ Big Gary V up in the office

2
00:00:03,335 --> 00:00:05,767
♫ Do rag flapping

3
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:07,820
♫ Talks about all the shift and leverage

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,987
♫ 1,800 checks to shout out the beverage

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,442
- [Man] So I think you need like.

6
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:18,565
- [Man] I do think that.

7
00:00:18,565 --> 00:00:20,391
- I think we need everyone to have.

8
00:00:20,391 --> 00:00:21,641
But if it were.

9
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:25,211
- I'm cramping.

10
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:27,533
You know, when there's a function,

11
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:31,779
it's, that I like a
lot, that I like a lot.

12
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:34,582
Alright, thank you, good start.

13
00:00:34,582 --> 00:00:37,322
(upbeat instrumental music)

14
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:38,631
Hi, how are you?

15
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:39,895
- [Woman] I'm good, how are you?

16
00:00:39,895 --> 00:00:41,047
- [Greg] Kelsey, real pleasure.

17
00:00:41,047 --> 00:00:41,880
I'll be right with you.

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,713
- [Woman] No worries.

19
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:43,546
- [Greg] I just need a few minutes.

20
00:00:43,546 --> 00:00:45,560
- I finally feel like I'm
truly in the right place

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,300
and time where I should be professionally,

22
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,042
and like this is where I want to be,

23
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:52,700
and I truly feel at home in this company.

24
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,576
- Like literally you're
going to send me an email.

25
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:56,334
I'm going to ask you to send me an email,

26
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:57,934
which I'm going to use as my to do list,

27
00:00:57,934 --> 00:01:01,686
and it's literally going to be, you know,

28
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:04,444
I'm literally going to
go get all your feedback,

29
00:01:04,444 --> 00:01:08,299
like speak to Claude, speak
to Steve, speak to Jason,

30
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:10,986
and see if there's something
I can help you with.

31
00:01:10,986 --> 00:01:15,154
- [Woman] That would
be amazing, seriously.

32
00:01:15,154 --> 00:01:17,012
- [Man] You sore?

33
00:01:17,012 --> 00:01:19,886
- I'm not sore, I'm cramping
in the middle of my back,

34
00:01:19,886 --> 00:01:23,720
which is not allowing me to function.

35
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,371
Would love to just get us all aligned

36
00:01:25,371 --> 00:01:26,474
on what our strategy is,

37
00:01:26,474 --> 00:01:29,550
and see what we can get done.

38
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,287
So what has happened since we last met?

39
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:36,120
♫ It's a complicated business

40
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:40,742
♫ And the feelings come and go

41
00:01:40,742 --> 00:01:42,978
- [Greg] I apologize, one minute.

42
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:46,645
(upbeat instrumental music)

43
00:01:48,644 --> 00:01:49,647
- An outrage.

44
00:01:49,647 --> 00:01:52,816
- Give you an update on the team,

45
00:01:52,816 --> 00:01:55,461
also to kind of like start having

46
00:01:55,461 --> 00:01:58,966
a high level discussion
just on like going.

47
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:00,197
- The industry, the state of the union.

48
00:02:00,197 --> 00:02:01,198
- Going forward.

49
00:02:01,198 --> 00:02:02,228
Yeah, what do we want to be doing?

50
00:02:02,228 --> 00:02:04,392
- In parallel, it is an industry
that is going to be massive

51
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:05,977
and will continue.

52
00:02:05,977 --> 00:02:08,152
Nothing's changed from
my level of my belief,

53
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:09,360
and you know it's interesting.

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,737
I was in Hong Kong.

55
00:02:10,738 --> 00:02:13,923
They're called KOLs there,
key opinion leaders.

56
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:18,090
The KOL market in China
and Asia is out of control.

57
00:02:19,434 --> 00:02:21,238
- [Man] It's huge, it's
their number one media.

58
00:02:21,238 --> 00:02:22,242
They don't even buy media.

59
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:25,046
- Because the platforms own everything

60
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:27,252
and because everything is tip based,

61
00:02:27,252 --> 00:02:31,025
so like all the influencers
are getting like tips

62
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,576
while they live chat.

63
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,309
I really want you deeply focused on this

64
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:36,918
because I know it's going to happen.

65
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:38,441
That I know I'm right about.

66
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:40,069
In the same way that I knew I was right

67
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:41,068
about social media ads,

68
00:02:41,068 --> 00:02:45,235
I believe that VaynerMedia
wins two obnoxious media AORs

69
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:49,717
on the back of our disproportionate truth

70
00:02:49,717 --> 00:02:53,723
that we understand influencer
marketing better than.

71
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:55,104
And I believe that we can make the market

72
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,728
fully believe that in
2022 and that's smart.

73
00:02:57,728 --> 00:02:58,736
Cool?

74
00:02:58,736 --> 00:02:59,737
- [Man] Cool.

75
00:02:59,737 --> 00:03:01,107
- Thank you. - [Woman] Hi.

76
00:03:01,107 --> 00:03:01,940
- [Greg] How are you?

77
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,773
- [Woman] Great to meet you.

78
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:03,805
- Such a pleasure, I'll be right with you.

79
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:05,733
The way to really win is
to have a pillar, right?

80
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:09,053
Book is a pillar, but
it's a historic pillar.

81
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:11,719
To me a new age pillar is either a vlog

82
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:16,275
or a podcast and you should
have one or the other.

83
00:03:16,275 --> 00:03:17,273
- [Woman] Okay.

84
00:03:17,273 --> 00:03:18,655
- Period.

85
00:03:18,655 --> 00:03:19,514
- [Woman] Okay.

86
00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:21,528
- Like to me, ironically, actually this is

87
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:22,532
the first time I'm saying this.

88
00:03:22,532 --> 00:03:26,677
To me, ironically, if you do
not have a vlog or a podcast

89
00:03:26,677 --> 00:03:30,969
right now, you're just
leaving an enormous amount

90
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:33,329
of opportunity, to me, you
know I guess I'm hedging,

91
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:36,459
but to me it's you become vulnerable

92
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:38,984
to not being relevant.

93
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:41,560
Like you need to have
both of them, one of them,

94
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,183
or you need to be an actual celebrity.

95
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,089
Like to me it's the only thing that equals

96
00:03:46,089 --> 00:03:49,838
having a television show
or being an actor, actress,

97
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:50,857
or like it's a pillar.

98
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:52,997
- My spoken word kind
of stuff has really been

99
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:55,690
the one thing that these
kids, no matter where I go,

100
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,555
freak out over, so a lot of
people have been telling me

101
00:03:58,555 --> 00:04:00,555
to just do a lot of videos for that,

102
00:04:00,555 --> 00:04:02,629
post it on Instagram,
YouTube, and all of that,

103
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:05,350
and again with the quality,
I'm just, I'm working.

104
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,230
- [Greg] That's why you're struggling.

105
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,229
- Okay.

106
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:12,560
- You put quality, your
personal subjective quality

107
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,313
on a pedestal.

108
00:04:14,313 --> 00:04:17,896
It is such a cliche
reason people struggle.

109
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,844
You're going to have to jump into the pool

110
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,777
and just see what happens,

111
00:04:22,777 --> 00:04:24,495
in the same way that at a macro level,

112
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:27,815
writing the book itself,
you've got to basically do

113
00:04:27,815 --> 00:04:29,255
the same thing with social.

114
00:04:29,255 --> 00:04:33,119
There's no piece of content
with bad enough lighting,

115
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:36,036
with bad enough quality, with like,

116
00:04:37,115 --> 00:04:39,352
there's no piece of content
that's going to take you down.

117
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:40,807
- Great.

118
00:04:40,807 --> 00:04:41,640
- Such a pleasure.

119
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,473
- [Woman] Yes.

120
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:43,306
- Have a great day.

121
00:04:43,306 --> 00:04:44,139
- Thank you, can I take
a picture with you?

122
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:44,972
- Sure, of course.

123
00:04:44,972 --> 00:04:48,639
(upbeat instrumental music)

124
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:54,161
- [Woman] Hi Greg.

125
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:54,994
- Hi.

126
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,282
- I feel like there's a lot of
exciting things happening now

127
00:04:56,282 --> 00:04:58,862
and I feel like I want to make sure

128
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:02,705
that I'm being smart about
short term helping the company,

129
00:05:02,705 --> 00:05:04,888
long term working towards my goal.

130
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:05,886
- Good for you.

131
00:05:05,886 --> 00:05:08,638
- You know I'm turning
30 in a week and a half

132
00:05:08,638 --> 00:05:11,921
and that just sparks a lot
of thoughts and feelings.

133
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:12,943
- 100%.

134
00:05:12,943 --> 00:05:17,159
- [Woman] I'm so acutely
aware the next couple years

135
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:18,758
can make a huge difference.

136
00:05:18,758 --> 00:05:19,978
- Yeah, that's probably right.

137
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:22,430
- [Woman] How I use my time
and what I do in this time.

138
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,565
- I would tell you a couple of things

139
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:25,482
as someone who's 41.

140
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:26,649
That is right,

141
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:30,359
and shockingly always right.

142
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:33,831
Like there are so many people

143
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:35,527
that are 57 years old right now,

144
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:40,344
have misplayed it in their own
mind and other people's minds

145
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:43,011
for the last, you know 37 years,

146
00:05:43,951 --> 00:05:47,703
and legitimately can
make a decision tomorrow

147
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:52,105
that makes the next 30 years
of their life so fruitful

148
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:56,609
that it covers the warts
of the prior 40 years.

149
00:05:56,609 --> 00:05:58,119
I genuinely know that to be true,

150
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:01,786
so you're right, but I
think it's imperative

151
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:03,978
that you don't cripple yourself

152
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:07,557
that there's this magical 36 month window

153
00:06:07,557 --> 00:06:10,856
between 30 and 33, that
if you play it right,

154
00:06:10,856 --> 00:06:13,595
you go on to have this incredible life

155
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:15,940
and if you don't you
have a fraction of it.

156
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,642
There's absolute truth to that.

157
00:06:18,642 --> 00:06:21,372
There's also equal non truth to it

158
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:25,287
if you decide to make a decision at 33.

159
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:27,561
Instead of tripling down on
the right career decisions,

160
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:29,919
I would argue that one of the best things

161
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,405
you can do for you to really win

162
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:33,978
is developing an off speed pitch

163
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:38,669
to your normal demeanor
that allows you to have,

164
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:42,522
it's unbelievable how
much comfort I have in,

165
00:06:42,522 --> 00:06:45,189
I'm content while still hungrier

166
00:06:46,993 --> 00:06:50,283
than anything I've ever even seen.

167
00:06:50,283 --> 00:06:53,008
That's fucking balance.

168
00:06:53,008 --> 00:06:57,175
♫ I realized that I never even knew

169
00:07:00,477 --> 00:07:03,394
♫ Your middle name

170
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:08,995
♫ I realized that summer's over

171
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,924
♫ It was my time

172
00:07:11,924 --> 00:07:14,341
♫ To go away

173
00:07:15,495 --> 00:07:17,336
- Binders, books, and I
just sit in front of my TV

174
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,662
watching the draft, the NFL draft.

175
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:23,455
- [Man] Who'd you like growing up?

176
00:07:23,455 --> 00:07:24,458
You did?

177
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,457
- My dream was to be the general manager

178
00:07:25,457 --> 00:07:26,524
of the New York Jets.

179
00:07:26,524 --> 00:07:30,426
My dream was to be the
first GM since 69 to.

180
00:07:30,426 --> 00:07:31,436
- [Man] Win a Super Bowl?

181
00:07:31,436 --> 00:07:34,071
- Manager for the Jets.

182
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:37,738
(upbeat instrumental music)

183
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:39,450
- Hello.

184
00:07:40,318 --> 00:07:43,508
Hello gang, how are you, how are things?

185
00:07:43,508 --> 00:07:45,657
I used to sell lemonade,
as you guys probably know,

186
00:07:45,657 --> 00:07:47,397
and one time a guy on a bike.

187
00:07:47,397 --> 00:07:48,445
I will never forget this story,

188
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:52,331
stops and has like a classic
old school 1980s water bottle,

189
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:53,773
so just a plastic water bottle,

190
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:57,199
and he goes fill this up
and I'll give you $10.

191
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,250
And it was probably
$1.25 worth of lemonade

192
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,239
if you measured it.

193
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:04,937
I don't think he even got to
fill this up and I'll give you.

194
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:06,958
I think he said, by the
time he was done with up,

195
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:10,302
I had it fully filled up, and that $10,

196
00:08:10,302 --> 00:08:12,779
to this day, I've never had a transaction,

197
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:15,262
million, multi million dollar transactions

198
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:18,095
never felt like that, to this day.

199
00:08:19,023 --> 00:08:20,419
So I get that $34 day.

200
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:21,417
I have one.

201
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,340
It's a $10 fill up and it feels better

202
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,142
than anything I've ever done
in my life professionally.

203
00:08:26,142 --> 00:08:28,180
And so how's it going
right now with culture?

204
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,195
- [Man] It's fun, I feel fine with it

205
00:08:29,195 --> 00:08:32,191
and I feel a couple
locations I can manage.

206
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:34,374
It just gets to a point where I feel like

207
00:08:34,374 --> 00:08:35,836
I'm just not there that often.

208
00:08:35,836 --> 00:08:37,027
- Okay, so that's the big punchline?

209
00:08:37,027 --> 00:08:41,044
Like you feel, from afar, that you like

210
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:43,450
are intrigued by how
much I care about that

211
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:45,496
and talk about that and it
seems like right to you?

212
00:08:45,496 --> 00:08:47,586
- [Man] Yeah, and I've
seen competitors fall

213
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:49,397
when they've had that problem.

214
00:08:49,397 --> 00:08:50,407
- Got it.

215
00:08:50,407 --> 00:08:52,366
So look, here's a couple core things.

216
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:56,119
Number one, you can't
control anything at scale.

217
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,017
The way you control it is at a macro,

218
00:08:58,017 --> 00:08:59,195
so here's what I mean by that.

219
00:08:59,195 --> 00:09:00,681
A couple things that I
think will stand out.

220
00:09:00,681 --> 00:09:03,162
Number one, you have to fire people

221
00:09:03,162 --> 00:09:05,418
that undermine the culture that you want,

222
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:06,961
regardless of what they do.

223
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:08,746
If you end up having 11 locations

224
00:09:08,746 --> 00:09:11,270
and the regional manager,
because that's the way

225
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,358
you decided to structure,
she or he has five stores

226
00:09:14,358 --> 00:09:16,344
under their watch and their stores

227
00:09:16,344 --> 00:09:18,371
are doing the best financially,

228
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:21,370
but you know that she's either changed

229
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,552
or it's been exposed that he can't manage

230
00:09:24,552 --> 00:09:27,917
the people anymore, you
have to fire that person.

231
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,126
The biggest reason people lose on culture

232
00:09:29,126 --> 00:09:31,596
is they value the money the
person brings to the table

233
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:35,082
over the undermining that that
person's creating to culture.

234
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:36,789
It's as simple as that.

235
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:39,875
I think the number one
way to make culture great

236
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,394
is to use a parenting analogy.

237
00:09:42,394 --> 00:09:45,798
Parents that really
dominate do the following.

238
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:46,797
There's a thing.

239
00:09:46,797 --> 00:09:48,073
Ricky's going to a new high school,

240
00:09:48,073 --> 00:09:49,290
we have to pick the high school.

241
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,530
Sally wants to go to sleep
away camp, which one?

242
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,596
We don't like Sally's new boyfriend, Rick.

243
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:55,017
Like all that shit, right?

244
00:09:55,017 --> 00:09:58,137
What great parents do is
they go into the bedroom,

245
00:09:58,137 --> 00:10:00,282
fucking duke it the fuck out,

246
00:10:00,282 --> 00:10:02,679
and then walk out of
that room united front

247
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:06,743
and there's no veering from the narrative.

248
00:10:06,743 --> 00:10:09,910
I did a great job with
that at Wine Library.

249
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,827
I did a good job with it at Vayner,

250
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,887
and then I did a bad job of it.

251
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:18,479
What I never told Steve
or the people of his level

252
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:21,646
and higher was no friction among us 50

253
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,851
and that's why there's
a lot to fix for Vayner,

254
00:10:25,851 --> 00:10:28,916
in my opinion, because
every single leader here

255
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,388
blindly needs to support
every other leader

256
00:10:30,388 --> 00:10:33,804
and then hash it out and then
use me as the Supreme Court

257
00:10:33,804 --> 00:10:37,426
because they may not be
able to get to a resolution,

258
00:10:37,426 --> 00:10:39,145
but then they can come to
me and I make decisions

259
00:10:39,145 --> 00:10:41,385
and then they have to blindly support that

260
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:43,173
or they can leave if
they hate my decision.

261
00:10:43,173 --> 00:10:44,179
- [Man] We're working on everything,

262
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:45,182
we're starting the music right now,

263
00:10:45,182 --> 00:10:48,224
but I'm recording things, but I don't feel

264
00:10:48,224 --> 00:10:49,870
like they're as good
as they're going to be

265
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,020
six months from now when I'm
really ready to put it out,

266
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,529
but I still want to start,
I still would like to start.

267
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:54,621
- I would put it out.

268
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:55,619
- [Man] Put it out anyway?

269
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:57,417
- I would put it out anyway,
but I would put it out anyway

270
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:59,204
under that pretext.

271
00:10:59,204 --> 00:11:01,459
So for example, you've got
to be smart with strategy.

272
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:03,363
Maybe you call it Alpha,

273
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:06,196
Alpha Music colon, and then you just put

274
00:11:06,196 --> 00:11:07,284
the title of the song.

275
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:09,319
And people are like what
the fuck is Alpha Music?

276
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:13,427
Like you literally just, like
we literally just made it up.

277
00:11:13,427 --> 00:11:14,680
It's Alpha Music.

278
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,110
It's now that we're in
the world of journey,

279
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,430
of documenting the journey,
and I know my music

280
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,848
is going to get substantially better,

281
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:21,823
this is music I'm making.

282
00:11:21,823 --> 00:11:24,284
I'd like you to hear it, I
want to document my journey,

283
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:25,663
but I'd like to call it Alpha Music

284
00:11:25,663 --> 00:11:28,197
because it's not ready for prime time.

285
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:29,780
Who says you can't?

286
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,016
I like this one.

287
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:33,873
By the way, this is why I document

288
00:11:33,873 --> 00:11:35,465
because I feel like that's just a really,

289
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:37,276
like I feel like that's what I would do

290
00:11:37,276 --> 00:11:39,389
if I was doing it, right?

291
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:43,056
(upbeat instrumental music)

292
00:11:51,196 --> 00:11:52,203
You guys ready?

293
00:11:52,203 --> 00:11:53,866
- [Group] Yeah.

294
00:11:53,866 --> 00:11:55,178
- [Gary] One minute.

295
00:11:55,178 --> 00:11:56,200
- [Man] That's all we need.

296
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,033
- Good.

297
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:58,163
- Hey, I'm Joe Harris.

298
00:11:58,163 --> 00:11:59,170
- My name is Juan Alsavar.

299
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,667
- My name is Ewan Vernet.

300
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,086
- My name is Daniel Fessler.

301
00:12:02,086 --> 00:12:04,617
- Alright, so we're needing
capital, right, to start this?

302
00:12:04,617 --> 00:12:06,661
What's in it for me is the questions.

303
00:12:06,661 --> 00:12:08,167
You're in a branding speed game.

304
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:09,842
Give the bill a brand.

305
00:12:09,842 --> 00:12:10,675
The end.

306
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:17,260
- He heard me, he
understood, and let's go.

307
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,571
I'm ready to go earn some money

308
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:22,497
and let's rock it right now.

309
00:12:22,497 --> 00:12:23,507
- [Woman] Awesome.

310
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:24,505
- Let's go.

311
00:12:24,505 --> 00:12:25,504
- It went better than
I could have expected.

312
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:28,511
We're ready to, you know, go forward.

313
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:30,564
- He's always providing
a wealth of knowledge

314
00:12:30,564 --> 00:12:34,546
and giving us all these
little tidbits of advice.

315
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:35,684
- Now one thing that I love about Gary V

316
00:12:35,684 --> 00:12:38,644
is that he keeps it real
and he offers real solutions

317
00:12:38,644 --> 00:12:41,920
that you can apply to
your business immediately.

318
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,506
- Making a better video
that doesn't have it

319
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:46,715
in the three seconds versus a worse video

320
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:47,873
that does have it in three seconds

321
00:12:47,873 --> 00:12:52,355
will most likely sell more cups
of coffee or wine, I think.

322
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,820
- [Man] It does and it doesn't.

323
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,492
There's a lot of different
variables at play.

324
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:57,205
- Go ahead, I mean like
this is the conversation

325
00:12:57,205 --> 00:12:59,439
I want to have, you know what I mean.

326
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:02,459
Why don't we watermark
the logo of every brand

327
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:03,701
in every video?

328
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:05,571
Why don't we put a ticker at the bottom?

329
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:08,386
Why don't we invent the
ticker for videos on Facebook

330
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:10,943
the way ESPN or CNBC or
whoever fucking invented.

331
00:13:10,943 --> 00:13:14,174
Someday some gal or guy
sat in a room like this

332
00:13:14,174 --> 00:13:15,424
and said let's make a fucking ticker.

333
00:13:15,424 --> 00:13:17,025
There was no tickers in 1972.

334
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:20,013
Andy, I want to create, you
know how ESPN has a ticker?

335
00:13:20,013 --> 00:13:22,515
I want every video that I
make for the next six months

336
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:23,516
to have a ticker.

337
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:25,349
- Socials, everything?

338
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:27,455
- I don't know.

339
00:13:27,455 --> 00:13:29,796
I now only put out videos with tickers.

340
00:13:29,796 --> 00:13:32,296
Let everybody start designing.

341
00:13:33,342 --> 00:13:34,398
That is my new thing.

342
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:35,705
I'm now the ticker guy.

343
00:13:35,705 --> 00:13:39,372
(upbeat instrumental music)

344
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:44,020
- [Man] Three, two, one.

345
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,021
- Can you give me five seconds?

346
00:13:45,021 --> 00:13:45,854
- Sure, sure.

347
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:46,687
- To walk with you.

348
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:47,520
- Ready?

349
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,353
