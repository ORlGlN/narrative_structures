1
00:00:00,128 --> 00:00:01,830
- What's up vlog, this is
super exciting interview

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,502
for me being a Jersey boy
growing up in the 90s,

3
00:00:05,502 --> 00:00:06,335
hip-hop era,

4
00:00:06,335 --> 00:00:07,323
Redman,

5
00:00:07,323 --> 00:00:08,176
the icon,

6
00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:09,445
the legend comes through,

7
00:00:09,445 --> 00:00:12,582
really interesting conversation
that I think actually

8
00:00:12,582 --> 00:00:15,609
maps to a ton of executives
who've had success,

9
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:18,063
a ton of entrepreneurs who've had success,

10
00:00:18,063 --> 00:00:21,725
a ton of you who won in your profession

11
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:22,655
with a little bit of,

12
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:27,270
what do you do when being
contemporary could be

13
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,318
slightly different than
what got you there,

14
00:00:29,318 --> 00:00:33,128
and so I'm super excited
about this meeting.

15
00:00:33,128 --> 00:00:35,063
I really think it's gonna
bring a ton of value

16
00:00:35,063 --> 00:00:36,029
to a lot of you,

17
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:38,109
so check it, let me know what you think.

18
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:40,692
(upbeat music)

19
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:46,242
I'm glad we connected, man.

20
00:00:46,242 --> 00:00:47,145
- Absolutely.

21
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:48,402
- [Gary] Thanks for all the love.

22
00:00:48,402 --> 00:00:51,088
- Yeah, yeah, absolute, thanks
for the inspiration, brother.

23
00:00:51,088 --> 00:00:53,004
- Man, that means a lot
to be coming from you,

24
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:55,139
I'm 42 and from Jersey,

25
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:57,041
I got real love for you, man.

26
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,137
Especially when you hit
me up the other day,

27
00:00:59,137 --> 00:00:59,970
like to be real quick,

28
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:00,803
I'm so..

29
00:01:03,212 --> 00:01:04,858
Boyd knows this, you know this,

30
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:06,474
I'm always focused on
how I can bring value.

31
00:01:06,474 --> 00:01:07,777
It's just my default
because I think that's where

32
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:08,882
the leverage is.

33
00:01:08,882 --> 00:01:09,765
- [Redman] Mhhm.

34
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:11,655
- Especially because if I never
have to cash in those chips

35
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,488
then I'm a legend, right?

36
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:14,420
- [Redman] That's right.

37
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,300
- But there was just
something about our exchange

38
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,561
the other day which is why
I wanted to get this in

39
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:18,635
real quick.

40
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:20,083
Just want to get to know you guys but

41
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,368
most importantly or you
may be able to help,

42
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:23,886
Boyd maybe you'll be able to help,

43
00:01:23,886 --> 00:01:27,621
but I'm like super
intrigued on how I can help.

44
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:28,454
- Good.

45
00:01:28,454 --> 00:01:29,287
- I want to know what
the fuck you are up to,

46
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:31,056
what's going on like how
you're thinking about

47
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:33,887
shit but I'm interested.

48
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:35,068
I'll help.

49
00:01:35,068 --> 00:01:35,981
- [Redman] Okay.

50
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:37,358
- But look I think um..

51
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:40,445
I look at the work that
DJ Khaled was doing on

52
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:42,175
SnapChat and years ago I was like Red,

53
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:43,623
he's the character,

54
00:01:43,623 --> 00:01:46,082
he's the guy who has to be chasing

55
00:01:46,082 --> 00:01:47,553
that attention and
getting to the new spots

56
00:01:47,553 --> 00:01:49,565
before everyone else

57
00:01:49,565 --> 00:01:50,398
- [Gary] 100%.

58
00:01:50,398 --> 00:01:53,293
- He's such a brand
and such a personality.

59
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:54,668
- [Gary] Such a personality.

60
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:56,947
- You were made for social
and you were made for

61
00:01:56,947 --> 00:01:58,095
being out there.

62
00:01:58,095 --> 00:01:59,203
- He was made for culture and

63
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:02,786
whenever the spotlights on 1997 MTV,

64
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:04,703
BET then it's going to work,

65
00:02:04,703 --> 00:02:06,725
and when the spotlights not on,

66
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:07,558
it won't because if you don't...

67
00:02:07,558 --> 00:02:10,496
Anytime people know like Seal,

68
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:12,859
it won't work every time.

69
00:02:12,859 --> 00:02:13,692
- [Redman] Absolutely.

70
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:16,863
- Like talent and charisma
and magic isn't teachable.

71
00:02:16,863 --> 00:02:20,046
The only time magic and
charisma and talent aren't

72
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:24,124
winning is when there's
not distribution behind it.

73
00:02:24,124 --> 00:02:24,957
The end.

74
00:02:26,223 --> 00:02:28,728
That's why what I'm up to is so powerful.

75
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:30,552
Once I finish building this machine,

76
00:02:30,552 --> 00:02:32,125
I'm bulding the Death Star.

77
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:35,264
Literally the Death Star of communication

78
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:37,010
and then you just point it.

79
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:37,843
When I say I can help,

80
00:02:37,843 --> 00:02:40,016
I'm interested in helping
to point it at you.

81
00:02:40,016 --> 00:02:40,849
Because it will,

82
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:41,682
(finger snaps)

83
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:42,515
and when I say this

84
00:02:42,515 --> 00:02:43,348
(finger snaps)

85
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:44,181
it can take 14 months but its like

86
00:02:44,181 --> 00:02:47,003
as long as you do the push ups and drink

87
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:49,764
the raw egg you'll win that fight.

88
00:02:49,764 --> 00:02:52,789
It's about staying disciplined that's all.

89
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:54,118
And then what else,

90
00:02:54,118 --> 00:02:54,951
you'll like this,

91
00:02:54,951 --> 00:02:55,784
it's just reverse engineering you,

92
00:02:55,784 --> 00:02:58,289
I think people of our generation,

93
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:00,520
its not like people their generation where

94
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,853
its like part of their body.

95
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:05,785
I have a lot of empathy for people that

96
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,355
especially if you're
a celebrity before it,

97
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,507
all those rules are broken,

98
00:03:09,507 --> 00:03:11,424
it's the reverse and so

99
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,185
it's about creating an infrastructure that

100
00:03:15,185 --> 00:03:16,380
allows you to produce the amount of

101
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,505
content you need to produce.

102
00:03:18,505 --> 00:03:19,912
Let's talk about it like family,

103
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:21,632
what the fuck do you want to happen?

104
00:03:21,632 --> 00:03:23,058
- [Redman] Well first of all
- How much is art

105
00:03:23,058 --> 00:03:24,029
and happiness?

106
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:25,503
How much is financial?

107
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:27,701
To me when you're figuring
out the next thing

108
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:28,720
you just break it down to cut

109
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,702
unemotional columns right?

110
00:03:30,702 --> 00:03:31,577
There's money,

111
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:34,256
and then there's creative happiness,

112
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,381
those are two buckets.

113
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,332
And then you just kind of like roll,

114
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:39,246
which one needs to be scratched,

115
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:41,688
by the way always both
when it's best, right?

116
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:42,521
- [Redman] Absolutely.

117
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,093
- And then just getting to know you.

118
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:46,271
Is that around fashion
is that around music

119
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:48,363
is that around funny clips,

120
00:03:48,363 --> 00:03:52,203
I mean you have a lot of flexibility.

121
00:03:52,203 --> 00:03:53,265
- I think it's also good
context to know that

122
00:03:53,265 --> 00:03:55,098
Doc also owns a clothing
store a skateboard shop.

123
00:03:55,098 --> 00:03:57,022
- [Gary] I'm aware.

124
00:03:57,022 --> 00:03:58,563
I'm aware.

125
00:03:58,563 --> 00:03:59,396
- That's something we've
spoken a lot about,

126
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:01,359
how to leverage his brand
and how to leverage...

127
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:02,964
- So what would you like to happen Red?

128
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:04,871
- First I would like to take advantage of

129
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:07,799
my platform that I have of being Redman,

130
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:08,632
my brand.

131
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:10,191
I think through the years,

132
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:12,374
my manager and me and Meth as well

133
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:14,528
we kept our brand up to a level where we

134
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:18,985
are highly respected and it's
not tainted with a lot of BS.

135
00:04:18,985 --> 00:04:22,125
So I want to take advantage of that

136
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:22,959
- [Gary] Cash in some of those chips.

137
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,065
- Absolutely.

138
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:25,326
On these media platforms,

139
00:04:25,326 --> 00:04:28,007
make sure that I'm generating
the right funds and

140
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:32,174
getting what's worth out of
being on the social media

141
00:04:34,027 --> 00:04:36,320
and then exploiting my creativity

142
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,004
as far clips,

143
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:39,716
movies.
- [Gary] You have so much man.

144
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:41,241
Yes it's a lot I can do.

145
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:43,658
- Boyd what do you think man?

146
00:04:44,622 --> 00:04:47,318
- I mean the store and
the platform that you

147
00:04:47,318 --> 00:04:48,685
were just talking about
sounds like a great,

148
00:04:48,685 --> 00:04:50,314
like Facebook Live,

149
00:04:50,314 --> 00:04:52,407
Instagram Live like branding.

150
00:04:52,407 --> 00:04:53,686
- What do you think
musically because I don't

151
00:04:53,686 --> 00:04:55,986
need to hear that from you.

152
00:04:55,986 --> 00:04:57,317
(laughs loudly)

153
00:04:57,317 --> 00:04:59,121
I'm just harassing you but just your

154
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:01,128
perspective on keeping it real but

155
00:05:01,128 --> 00:05:03,461
what's your curiosity of it?

156
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,021
How do you think...

157
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:06,854
Actually before I ask you,

158
00:05:06,854 --> 00:05:07,687
I apologize,

159
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:08,808
where are you with music,

160
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,408
menatally?

161
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:12,319
- Oh I'm mentally, I'm 100%

162
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,807
- [Gary] Meaning you
want to produce projects?

163
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:14,732
- Absolutely.

164
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:16,465
- [Gary] Where are you contractually?

165
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:19,550
You a free agent?
- Yes free agent absolutely.

166
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,785
You got obligations?

167
00:05:20,785 --> 00:05:21,948
What's the last thing you did?

168
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:26,060
- My last album I put out
was on INgrooves Distribution

169
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,060
out there in California its the test and

170
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,300
I'm doing a new album Muddy Waters 2

171
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,363
and I'm putting that out
through INgrooves as well

172
00:05:33,363 --> 00:05:34,794
Distribution.

173
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:37,384
- If this started a real relationship

174
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:38,517
that we were really like helping you

175
00:05:38,517 --> 00:05:40,017
like family stuff,

176
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:42,390
would you wait,

177
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,223
can you wait?

178
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:44,428
- [Redman] Yes of course.

179
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,542
- I'm thinking about...

180
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:48,148
It's the best feeling isn't it?

181
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,731
- [Redman] Sure is.

182
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:51,956
- Okay what do you think,

183
00:05:51,956 --> 00:05:52,789
for real?

184
00:05:54,356 --> 00:05:56,584
To make this a real meeting,

185
00:05:56,584 --> 00:05:58,166
this is the right time for everybody to be

186
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,233
real truthful because
I really have a lot of

187
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:01,741
intent to help.

188
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:03,318
I'm so fucking busy.

189
00:06:03,318 --> 00:06:04,194
- [Redman] Yes of course.

190
00:06:04,194 --> 00:06:07,816
- I want to deal in
straight truths because then

191
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:09,359
I know what to do.

192
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:10,757
If I start feeling like
I'm trying to figure out

193
00:06:10,757 --> 00:06:13,377
exactly what then I'm dead
because I'm just to...

194
00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:14,497
See what I mean.

195
00:06:14,497 --> 00:06:16,186
What I mean by that is,

196
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:17,410
do you really want to this?

197
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,420
What do you really want to do?

198
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,253
Where is it?

199
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,086
I'm curious,

200
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:21,087
for example,

201
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:23,009
you're such a real fucking legend

202
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:25,231
back to how this shit all works out

203
00:06:25,231 --> 00:06:27,405
there's a ton of 17 19 year olds that are

204
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:29,608
really meaningful in
the music game who don't

205
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:32,369
know you are because
that's just how life works.

206
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:33,202
- [Redman] That's right.

207
00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:34,035
- We all know that.

208
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:36,183
But if you actually decide to like,

209
00:06:36,183 --> 00:06:37,968
what I don't have a sense of,

210
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:39,691
because I don't know and
that's why I'm asking,

211
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:40,524
and I'll get back to you,

212
00:06:40,524 --> 00:06:41,357
I apologize.

213
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:42,190
- [Redman] No problem.

214
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,023
- Is where your line
is between you wanting

215
00:06:43,023 --> 00:06:47,110
Muddy Waters 2 to be really successful and

216
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,994
what are the lines in
the sand artistically

217
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:53,089
that can't be crossed
to make it successful?

218
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:54,707
And the cool part with me is,

219
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:55,862
I don't care,

220
00:06:55,862 --> 00:06:56,806
I just want to know.

221
00:06:56,806 --> 00:06:58,189
Let me explain.

222
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:00,408
Might think you should have five to six

223
00:07:00,408 --> 00:07:02,074
meaningful collaborations on that album

224
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:06,075
and siphon the pulse of what's emerging

225
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:07,055
but you might say,

226
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:08,747
I don't want to fuck with Lil Zan,

227
00:07:08,747 --> 00:07:11,200
like I'm not putting 21 Savage on this.

228
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,730
I don't know that but once I understand it

229
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,563
and understand where...

230
00:07:15,563 --> 00:07:17,136
I'm not going to make you move your lines.

231
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,521
I just want to know what the lines are

232
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:21,229
and then I want to fill it with the shit

233
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:22,645
that I know creates magic.

234
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:23,690
- [Redman] Makes sense.

235
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,649
- You understand?

236
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:27,784
- [Redman] I just think there's a lot of

237
00:07:27,784 --> 00:07:29,387
opportunities on the table.

238
00:07:29,387 --> 00:07:31,515
- Right, you need to make some music Doc.

239
00:07:31,515 --> 00:07:33,415
The music that...

240
00:07:33,415 --> 00:07:36,165
Not the music that people expect.

241
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,399
Only good's going to happen.

242
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:42,482
Lil' Wayne made a fucking rock album.

243
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:46,168
He's okay.

244
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:49,851
If the first thing you do is a

245
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:51,933
fucking piece of shit song straight up

246
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:52,909
by the market

247
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:54,438
you wouldn't put it
out if you didn't think

248
00:07:54,438 --> 00:07:55,271
it was good,

249
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:56,247
but let's say it doesn't work.

250
00:07:56,247 --> 00:08:00,319
It's going to do nothing
to your fucking status.

251
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,830
Michael Jordan played for the Wizards.

252
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,777
But my intuition is,

253
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,527
you do it four times,

254
00:08:10,361 --> 00:08:12,596
17 year olds in Oklahoma
City are going to be like,

255
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:15,679
you my new favorite artist is Redman.

256
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,119
That's what I think.

257
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:22,036
I know with every ounce of my soul.

258
00:08:24,078 --> 00:08:25,078
You do that,

259
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:28,515
let me give you a little secret,

260
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:30,339
the skateboard shop,

261
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:32,279
the clothing brand,

262
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,323
the following count on Instagram

263
00:08:35,323 --> 00:08:37,240
it all starts changing.

264
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:45,215
Khaled and SnapChat is a
once in a decade thing.

265
00:08:45,215 --> 00:08:48,660
You putting out a song that gets hot,

266
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,237
that's a foregone conclusion.

267
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:52,005
You just need to get
the fuck out of the jail

268
00:08:52,005 --> 00:08:54,172
that everybody put you in.

269
00:08:57,655 --> 00:09:00,589
- Sensitive ass audience I got.

270
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:01,422
(laughs)

271
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:02,842
- Guess what, they love
you and you love them.

272
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:03,950
- [Redman] That's right.

273
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,783
- Guess what,

274
00:09:04,783 --> 00:09:06,783
I got shit on for not
being the wine guy anymore

275
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:08,767
when I started talking about business,

276
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:10,017
until I didn't.

277
00:09:12,874 --> 00:09:13,817
Leave your two cents below,

278
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:15,939
make sure you subscribe to the channel,

279
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:18,802
what's your thoughts on Redman,

280
00:09:18,802 --> 00:09:22,969
what's your thoughts on my
performance in this meeting.

281
00:09:23,944 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
