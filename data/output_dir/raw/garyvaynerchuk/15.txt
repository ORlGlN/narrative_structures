1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,173
- You either dwell on it
for the rest of your life

2
00:00:02,173 --> 00:00:04,988
and decide the reason you
weren't successful in life

3
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:06,989
is because when you were 19, your brother

4
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:08,739
stole $8,000 from you,

5
00:00:08,739 --> 00:00:11,985
or you put that chip on your shoulder,

6
00:00:11,985 --> 00:00:15,752
and you get more motivated
than ever, and you go harder.

7
00:00:15,752 --> 00:00:19,002
(peaceful piano music)

8
00:00:20,746 --> 00:00:23,031
Every minute's accounted
for, so when I'm on,

9
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:24,638
I'm on.

10
00:00:24,638 --> 00:00:29,221
It's 15 hours, tight, all
in, morning to night, period.

11
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:35,350
What I know is I know that
how the platforms work.

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,363
When you have a direct ask at the end,

13
00:00:38,363 --> 00:00:41,434
when it's about go fill
this out, go donate,

14
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:46,434
you've taken 50% of the energy
out of the piece of content.

15
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:49,835
When there's an ask in the same time

16
00:00:49,835 --> 00:00:53,194
that there is a setup, you've lost equity.

17
00:00:53,194 --> 00:00:54,193
- So the strategies--

18
00:00:54,193 --> 00:00:55,802
- The charming guy at the bar,

19
00:00:55,802 --> 00:00:58,037
who is a very nice, one-hour conversation,

20
00:00:58,037 --> 00:00:59,962
if his last thing out of his mouth's like,

21
00:00:59,962 --> 00:01:01,016
"Alright, you want to come upstairs?"

22
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:03,694
He kind of defeated a lot of the setup,

23
00:01:03,694 --> 00:01:04,917
whereas if you just--

24
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:06,000
- Never thought about it that way before.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,846
- But this is how I think about it, right?

26
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:09,484
But like, this is a very
good way to think about it,

27
00:01:09,484 --> 00:01:10,448
'cause it's very universal and

28
00:01:10,448 --> 00:01:11,955
every human understands it.

29
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:14,037
Had that been turned into another date,

30
00:01:14,037 --> 00:01:16,558
and another date, the mission could

31
00:01:16,558 --> 00:01:17,931
have been accomplished for whatever

32
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:19,246
the agenda was at hand.

33
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,109
That's where I want you to go.

34
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:23,279
Because, you have to understand why.

35
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:25,319
Every person that reads and consumes that,

36
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,024
I can cookie and re-target them,

37
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:32,937
and ask them separately in
a different environment.

38
00:01:32,937 --> 00:01:34,520
It's not like a gala.

39
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,427
- It's relationships.

40
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:38,353
- In a gala, when we're
at our highest emotion,

41
00:01:38,353 --> 00:01:41,575
yes, that, you know, in the moment.

42
00:01:41,575 --> 00:01:42,408
Not digitally.

43
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:43,241
- Yeah.

44
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:44,074
- Got it?

45
00:01:44,074 --> 00:01:45,865
Digitally I got that.

46
00:01:45,865 --> 00:01:46,927
It's like if I went to the gala

47
00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:48,508
at the highest emotion, but you put

48
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,011
a little bug on me and you could

49
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:52,231
talk to me all the time.

50
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:53,583
You see?

51
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,231
It's a different setup.

52
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:57,493
Guys, thank you so much.

53
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:59,677
We'll be in touch, yeah.

54
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:01,165
I think for all of you the truth

55
00:02:01,165 --> 00:02:02,915
is always the answer.

56
00:02:03,943 --> 00:02:07,394
I think you should test an education,

57
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:10,061
and a, like, you're teaching and

58
00:02:10,935 --> 00:02:12,786
you're keeping up with them,

59
00:02:12,786 --> 00:02:14,201
but you're doing it tactically.

60
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,437
I'm not talking about
a mastermind, you know?

61
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:19,445
I'm not talking about like, details.

62
00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:21,052
Like, the way this is forming,

63
00:02:21,052 --> 00:02:23,045
like, you're getting into real details.

64
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:25,143
Like it's just details.

65
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:26,562
So I think if you're able to continue

66
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:27,817
to educate people on details, like

67
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:30,738
why did Snap-, Snapchat changed last week.

68
00:02:30,738 --> 00:02:32,316
So now there's new details.

69
00:02:32,316 --> 00:02:34,382
I'm playing with it, every day.

70
00:02:34,382 --> 00:02:35,796
And my whole thesis that I told everybody

71
00:02:35,796 --> 00:02:37,176
for the last two years,
like don't give up,

72
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:39,129
last year, don't give up on Snapchat

73
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:40,388
because if they make a move,

74
00:02:40,388 --> 00:02:44,208
my Snapchat consumption's up 100%.

75
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,110
Because they changed the UI,

76
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,155
and they're favoring personalities now.

77
00:02:50,155 --> 00:02:51,645
Anyway, like that.

78
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:52,975
Like, LinkedIn made a change,

79
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:54,647
Facebook had its change,

80
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:55,786
Instagram's organic reach dropped,

81
00:02:55,786 --> 00:02:57,472
like in the world we plan,

82
00:02:57,472 --> 00:02:58,894
there is a need for constant weekly

83
00:02:58,894 --> 00:03:00,872
updated with everything.

84
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:02,703
And like it took him and everybody else

85
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:04,833
like whoa, this guy plays it different,

86
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,548
masel tov, but then you,

87
00:03:06,548 --> 00:03:07,940
the reason I do that is I don't

88
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,431
want to give ammo to anybody.

89
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:12,909
Drake, the commercial with his liquor,

90
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:16,111
where his dad punks
him, is why Drake wins.

91
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:17,069
Drake's smart.

92
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:19,909
Drake really understands the game.

93
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:21,388
Drake knows that he's gonna be

94
00:03:21,388 --> 00:03:22,894
hated on for his style of

95
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:25,743
actor, pretty boy, singer, rapper,

96
00:03:25,743 --> 00:03:29,578
so he, he, I think
Drake, more than anybody,

97
00:03:29,578 --> 00:03:31,790
uses the "8 Mile" thesis of he's gonna

98
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,567
make fun of himself.

99
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,877
You know why Drake can't lose a battle?

100
00:03:35,877 --> 00:03:37,029
'Cause he's gonna shit on himself,

101
00:03:37,029 --> 00:03:39,569
there's nothing Meek or
anybody else can say.

102
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:40,882
He's gonna say it.

103
00:03:40,882 --> 00:03:43,156
So you can't say, "You
can't rap, you sing."

104
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,291
It's already over.

105
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,392
Honestly, here's what's up.

106
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,936
Like, I want to start a show called "And."

107
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,898
I've been thinking about
this, I'm gonna call it "And."

108
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:52,458
People are gonna call in,
tell me their problem,

109
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,932
and I'm gonna say, "And?"

110
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:55,765
Right?

111
00:03:55,765 --> 00:03:56,913
It's a good show, right?

112
00:03:56,913 --> 00:03:58,201
Like, tell me anything.

113
00:03:58,201 --> 00:03:59,971
My, both my parents were crackheads.

114
00:03:59,971 --> 00:04:01,306
And?

115
00:04:01,306 --> 00:04:03,067
Like, uh, I lost my job.

116
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:04,112
And?

117
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:05,019
My husband's beating me.

118
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:05,852
And?

119
00:04:05,852 --> 00:04:06,685
Look, these are real shit,

120
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:08,346
I'm not fucking saying
these are small things,

121
00:04:08,346 --> 00:04:09,479
these are the hardest things in life.

122
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:12,543
Here's my question:
life's about alternatives.

123
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,237
What the fuck are you gonna do about it?

124
00:04:15,237 --> 00:04:16,771
Leave your husband.

125
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:18,935
I get it, you live in a house that's nice,

126
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:20,909
and you don't know how to
work, and you've never worked.

127
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,501
But you want to get punched in the face?

128
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:25,612
Absolutely not, that's
fucking unacceptable.

129
00:04:25,612 --> 00:04:26,445
And.

130
00:04:27,855 --> 00:04:28,825
- [Premium Pete] I love it.

131
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:30,204
I can't wait for it, I can't wait for it.

132
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:32,079
I need to come on there and talk to some--

133
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,400
- But think about it, right?

134
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,233
Pete, like, what what--

135
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,066
- [Premium Pete] No, you're right.

136
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:35,899
- I'm gonna call, brrrrrrring,

137
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:37,074
make sure you, make pretend
you have the "And" show.

138
00:04:37,074 --> 00:04:37,907
Ready?

139
00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:38,908
Pete listen, but you don't understand,

140
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:41,820
like, my my brother, my older brother, he

141
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,545
I had $8,000, I've been
working three jobs,

142
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:47,109
and he walked in my room
and stole it, and left.

143
00:04:47,109 --> 00:04:48,445
- [Premium Pete] And?

144
00:04:48,445 --> 00:04:49,278
- That's it.

145
00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:50,111
- [Premium Pete] Or I can
say what the fuck, and?

146
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:51,131
- No, no, no.

147
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:52,263
Just and, and.

148
00:04:52,263 --> 00:04:53,096
- [Premium Pete] Okay, my bad.

149
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:53,971
- And.

150
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:56,026
And you either dwell on it for

151
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:57,356
the rest of your life, and decide

152
00:04:57,356 --> 00:04:59,712
the reason you weren't successful in life

153
00:04:59,712 --> 00:05:01,408
is because when you were 19,

154
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:03,610
your brother stole $8,000 from you,

155
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,736
or you put that chip on your shoulder,

156
00:05:06,736 --> 00:05:08,500
and you get more motivated than ever,

157
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,639
and you go harder.

158
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,968
- [Premium Pete] Well, people deal with

159
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:13,199
a lot of depression these days.

160
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,039
- No shit.

161
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:15,082
You know why?

162
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:15,933
- [Premium Pete] You ever get depressed?

163
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:16,791
- I don't.

164
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:17,696
- [Premium Pete] How the fuck?

165
00:05:17,696 --> 00:05:18,866
Yo, you're not normal, bro.

166
00:05:18,866 --> 00:05:20,860
- I'm not normal, bro.

167
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,693
- I'm not fucking normal.

168
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:23,233
- [Premium Pete] You never get depressed?

169
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:24,963
- I get disappointed and frustrated,

170
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:26,621
but actually thinking, like I'm

171
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:30,555
always macro-optimistic, like I got life.

172
00:05:30,555 --> 00:05:32,863
The fuck do I have to be, I'm in control.

173
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:34,139
I think people are depressed when

174
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,068
they don't have things into context.

175
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:37,975
They don't realize how lucky they have it.

176
00:05:37,975 --> 00:05:40,115
And two, they don't feel in control.

177
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:43,078
It's tough, I don't get
depressed, I get, I get,

178
00:05:43,078 --> 00:05:45,272
I get critical on my actions.

179
00:05:45,272 --> 00:05:46,530
I get thoughtful.

180
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,428
When I'm in a bad place I'm like,

181
00:05:47,428 --> 00:05:50,747
okay, what am I doing that's wrong?

182
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:53,242
Like, but listen, my chemic-, listen

183
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:54,392
this is an illness, some people

184
00:05:54,392 --> 00:05:55,841
have chemicals that, like this is about

185
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:58,147
my brain is right.

186
00:05:58,147 --> 00:06:00,184
Like I have to be thankful for that.

187
00:06:00,184 --> 00:06:01,920
But here's my thing, I don't know how

188
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,678
to teach, how to get
people out of depression,

189
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:06,784
I'm just trying to change
people's perspective.

190
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:09,729
It's awfully hard to give
when you have nothing to give.

191
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:11,629
It's awfully hard to--

192
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:12,826
- You can't give what you don't have.

193
00:06:12,826 --> 00:06:14,593
- I've come to realize, wow, that's right,

194
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:15,871
I realized I was so talented,

195
00:06:15,871 --> 00:06:17,506
everything's a foregone conclusion,

196
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:19,528
that I'm able to give more than I take,

197
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:21,035
because I don't need
anything from anybody,

198
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:22,451
I can get it myself.

199
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:25,030
When you're self-fulfilling,

200
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,988
you become super dangerous,

201
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:28,998
in the slang term of, like,

202
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:30,525
you've got all the leverage.

203
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:33,137
- You do see it as ledger, right?

204
00:06:33,137 --> 00:06:34,463
- I do, 100%.

205
00:06:34,463 --> 00:06:35,582
And I think the key with me,

206
00:06:35,582 --> 00:06:38,068
when I say I'm more of it
than anybody I've ever met,

207
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:40,377
I mean what I'm about to tell you.

208
00:06:40,377 --> 00:06:43,386
Nobody has ever disappointed
me in my entire life.

209
00:06:43,386 --> 00:06:44,637
- That's awesome.

210
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,676
- It's a really important, like, concept

211
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:48,475
that I don't speak to a lot.

212
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,165
Nobody has ever let me down.

213
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:51,912
Nobody has ever let me down.

214
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,457
Nobody has ever let me down because--

215
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:55,961
- Is that self-actualizing
or is it more forgiveness?

216
00:06:55,961 --> 00:06:57,187
- No, it's actually neither.

217
00:06:57,187 --> 00:07:00,309
It's, it's I have zero
expectation of others.

218
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:01,142
- Really?

219
00:07:01,142 --> 00:07:01,975
- Mmhmm.

220
00:07:01,975 --> 00:07:04,685
And that's, I think, what I'm realizing

221
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:07,209
is the purest form of
giving without expectation.

222
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:11,015
Like, I don't, I don't give more to you

223
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:13,022
than I give to your daughter,

224
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:15,265
because you have more to give to me back.

225
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:17,371
It's just that I look at you two the same.

226
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:19,229
It's a very weird game, man.

227
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:21,896
Like, I equally think that Zucks

228
00:07:22,796 --> 00:07:24,770
can do as much for me as Schmucks,

229
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,412
because I don't know how it all plays out.

230
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,245
- Right.

231
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:28,434
- But way more importantly,

232
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:30,329
it's not even that strategic.

233
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:32,829
I'm not looking for the other part.

234
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:33,662
- Yeah, I--

235
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:34,701
- I mean, this is real, and--

236
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:35,727
- You're detached, you're detached.

237
00:07:35,727 --> 00:07:36,560
- I'm detached, bro.

238
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,980
Like, when we, when we meet, right?

239
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,813
- Yeah.

240
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:40,006
- You meet me at an interesting point,

241
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:41,849
when we meet, which is I have a new baby

242
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:43,594
called VaynerSports and you have a lot

243
00:07:43,594 --> 00:07:45,591
of leverage to give to me,

244
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:48,869
even in that moment, I can't get excited

245
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:51,859
about the thought of like, quid pro quo,

246
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:53,711
or like, I'm gonna give to him

247
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:54,998
because in two years, he'll give,

248
00:07:54,998 --> 00:07:57,447
like, it just doesn't run through my mind.

249
00:07:57,447 --> 00:07:58,523
I don't want to meet anybody,

250
00:07:58,523 --> 00:08:00,131
like I'm about to meet the amazing

251
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:01,664
all-time Warren Moon,
I'm gonna say one thing,

252
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:03,858
which is the '91 playoff
game against the Jets

253
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,705
really pissed me off, Warren,

254
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:06,106
and I don't want to be your friend.

255
00:08:06,106 --> 00:08:07,755
Like, it's not gonna be, it's not--

256
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:08,838
- I'm glad I'm not a football player.

257
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:11,368
- It's not, it's a very weird game.

258
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:12,982
It's, it's a strength and a weakness.

259
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:15,065
It's why I also don't have mentors,

260
00:08:15,065 --> 00:08:17,146
and I've left a lot of
opportunity on the table.

261
00:08:17,146 --> 00:08:19,797
So when I'm on, I'm on.

262
00:08:19,797 --> 00:08:22,709
It's 15 hours, tight, all-in,

263
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:26,088
morning to night, period, right?

264
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,369
But when I'm off, or
when I'm at a Jets game,

265
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:30,674
or when it's vacation time, I'm off.

266
00:08:30,674 --> 00:08:32,196
And I can shut it off and on,

267
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:33,857
and I'm winning in those extremes.

268
00:08:33,857 --> 00:08:35,696
And I believe there's more of that allowed

269
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:37,384
than people think, because I think people

270
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,325
are being half-pregnant on both.

271
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:40,524
Like they want a work/life balance,

272
00:08:40,524 --> 00:08:42,671
and they're working nine to
five, they're coming home.

273
00:08:42,671 --> 00:08:44,227
Or they think like, I don't know,

274
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:45,421
I just think people have it confused.

275
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:47,937
I think there's more
victories in the extremes,

276
00:08:47,937 --> 00:08:49,589
and that's how you balance out.

277
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:50,532
It's like a bridge.

278
00:08:50,532 --> 00:08:52,426
A bridge is fucking extreme.

279
00:08:52,426 --> 00:08:53,801
You gotta cross from
one side to the other,

280
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:55,767
there's a big fucking ocean in the middle,

281
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,424
and they're pulling hard as fuck

282
00:08:57,424 --> 00:08:59,220
from those two opposite sides,

283
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,384
that's how I think of myself

284
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:02,468
and I'm trying to teach that a little bit.

285
00:09:02,468 --> 00:09:06,096
Babin, remember the new rule of three

286
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:07,342
Snapchat pieces of content?

287
00:09:07,342 --> 00:09:08,434
Oh, you weren't in the meeting?

288
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:09,267
- [Babin] I wasn't here Friday.

289
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:10,369
- You were bouncing around when

290
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:11,202
we had our biggest meeting ever.

291
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:12,785
- [Babin] Exactly.

292
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,300
- Guys, I'm supposed to be doing way more

293
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,712
Snapchat content, but Babin wasn't there

294
00:09:17,712 --> 00:09:19,548
for our big meeting last Friday

295
00:09:19,548 --> 00:09:20,696
because he was just bullshitting,

296
00:09:20,696 --> 00:09:22,214
so sorry 'bout that.

297
00:09:22,214 --> 00:09:24,332
It's my fault ultimately, but

298
00:09:24,332 --> 00:09:27,591
let's also tweet out "Boo Babin."

299
00:09:27,591 --> 00:09:30,797
Hit me up on Twitter and go "Boo Babin."

300
00:09:30,797 --> 00:09:32,092
Like it's one thing, if, like,

301
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:33,766
you know how we got into this cadence,

302
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:36,840
he wanted to show something
on his big computer, right?

303
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,308
But I'm always, I feel like, with no joke,

304
00:09:39,308 --> 00:09:40,604
I'm obviously making jokes,

305
00:09:40,604 --> 00:09:42,610
it's more about them
getting their full meeting.

306
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,346
If I'm left to me getting down there,

307
00:09:44,346 --> 00:09:45,850
they're in deep shit, and we always lose.

308
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,506
Whereas if they're here, I feel like

309
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:49,556
they're losing 10 minutes every meeting.

310
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:50,589
You know what I mean?

311
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:51,707
Now, on the flip side,

312
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:52,611
I should probably go down there,

313
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:53,444
'cause it's like the few times

314
00:09:53,444 --> 00:09:56,485
I actually get downstairs,
so there's also that.

315
00:09:56,485 --> 00:09:58,272
So it's a real tough decision, Alex.

316
00:09:58,272 --> 00:09:59,698
You make the call.

317
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:01,846
(laughter and excited yelling)

318
00:10:01,846 --> 00:10:06,099
You have to pull from opposite directions.

319
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:06,932
Yes.

320
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:08,765
- Super quick question, alright.

321
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:11,053
So your gold play button is ready.

322
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:11,886
- My what?

323
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:13,596
- Your gold play button,
like that other one.

324
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:14,592
- Oh, I have a gold play button now?

325
00:10:14,592 --> 00:10:16,483
- Yeah, 'cause you hit a million.

326
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,455
- I love how I don't even know

327
00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:19,274
what YouTube's, okay, and?

328
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:21,162
Like people's entire
lives are about getting--

329
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,150
- Put a gun to your head,

330
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,146
you wouldn't have know what
a gold play button was.

331
00:10:24,146 --> 00:10:25,140
- If you didn't point to that,

332
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,116
I had no shot, okay?

333
00:10:26,116 --> 00:10:29,681
- Yeah, um, you want it to say
Gary Vaynerchuk, like that?

334
00:10:29,681 --> 00:10:31,254
Or do you want it to say Gary Vee?

335
00:10:31,254 --> 00:10:32,740
- What do you think?

336
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,996
- Well, uh, so I'm in the middle.

337
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:36,951
I, I think that it's just up to you,

338
00:10:36,951 --> 00:10:40,121
because D-rock says Gary
Vee matches sale branding,

339
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:41,791
Andy says Gary Vaynerchuk matches

340
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,947
your other play button.

341
00:10:42,947 --> 00:10:44,364
I say Vaynerchuk.

342
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:46,262
- I think--

343
00:10:46,262 --> 00:10:47,095
- He's going against D-rock.

344
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:49,390
- I want, no, D-rock wants Gar--, I want,

345
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,798
D-rock, you're gonna love this,

346
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:51,639
we're going with Gary Vee.

347
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,148
I feel like I have a Gary Vaynerchuk,

348
00:10:53,148 --> 00:10:54,232
so let's go with Gary Vee.

349
00:10:54,232 --> 00:10:56,204
I was actually smiling, because

350
00:10:56,204 --> 00:10:57,864
basically my schtick is to razz with you,

351
00:10:57,864 --> 00:10:58,829
and I'm, like, happy for you

352
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:00,757
that you won this round.

353
00:11:00,757 --> 00:11:02,229
Congrats, D-rock.

354
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:04,312
- Sounds good, thank you.

355
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,580
- By the way, by the way.

356
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,988
Actually, this just happened,

357
00:11:08,988 --> 00:11:10,420
we are not doing enough

358
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,407
of the human stuff in the vlog.

359
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,340
Like this stuff happens every day,

360
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,920
and it's not in the vlog,

361
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,795
'cause we're staying very
prescriptive to bring value.

362
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:22,097
I think breaking up, you know,

363
00:11:22,097 --> 00:11:23,749
or maybe I'm also not watching that much,

364
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,661
so this is a little bit of my perception,

365
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:26,838
but, what's that?

366
00:11:26,838 --> 00:11:28,421
- Same page.

367
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,886
- Em, you and I are
always on the same page.

368
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:30,719
- I know.

369
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:32,636
It's really refreshing.

370
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,834
- Babin, that's exactly when you

371
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,324
should be filming something for Snapchat,

372
00:11:37,324 --> 00:11:39,232
but once again, even though I've--

373
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,399
- [Babin] I don't know what the rule is.

374
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,828
- You're a big boy.

375
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:43,894
You should have been able to,

376
00:11:43,894 --> 00:11:44,727
like the fact that you weren't

377
00:11:44,727 --> 00:11:46,128
able to pick up on the nuances

378
00:11:46,128 --> 00:11:47,586
of what the rule was.

379
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:49,195
I know you know what the rule was.

380
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:50,462
I said to you, you're supposed--

381
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:52,321
- [Babin] I know, you
make Snapchat comments.

382
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:53,756
- What fucking rule?

383
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:55,023
Like what was confusing?

384
00:11:55,023 --> 00:11:56,630
Hey bro, I even said the number,

385
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,355
I said, hey, we're supposed to make three

386
00:11:58,355 --> 00:12:00,317
Snap-, I literally verbatim said to you.

387
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:02,432
Can you please recall it
for the vlog right now?

388
00:12:02,432 --> 00:12:05,803
Babin, remember the new rule of three

389
00:12:05,803 --> 00:12:07,129
Snapchat pieces of content?

390
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:08,402
Oh, you weren't in the meeting.

391
00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:09,707
And then I even made a snap about it.

392
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:10,956
Boo Babin.

393
00:12:10,956 --> 00:12:12,617
And now, I just brought it up again.

394
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:13,790
That's exactly when you should be

395
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,151
filming something for Snapchat.

396
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,384
And you claim that you
don't know what's going on.

397
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:20,408
Kids, excuses are always the wrong answer.

398
00:12:20,408 --> 00:00:00,000
