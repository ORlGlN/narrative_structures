1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:02,238
- A video went ridiculously viral--

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:03,622
- I got, I got, I got

3
00:00:03,622 --> 00:00:05,381
- on the internet, about
a kid trying to get

4
00:00:05,381 --> 00:00:07,008
a job with us at Vayner.

5
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:10,047
♫ Internship on internship
inside my resume

6
00:00:10,047 --> 00:00:11,684
- It's okay, Brett, let it play.

7
00:00:11,684 --> 00:00:14,358
I love how you looked as if your alarm

8
00:00:14,358 --> 00:00:17,159
is gonna stop me from doing this setup.

9
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:17,992
- [Brett] Just to remind
you to buy chocolate.

10
00:00:17,992 --> 00:00:19,042
- I know, I'm buying
chocolate. (bell dings)

11
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:20,514
Listen.

12
00:00:20,514 --> 00:00:21,809
This kid hacked it.

13
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:24,892
This interview, meeting, opportunity,

14
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:30,301
fairy tale ending, growth hacking strategy

15
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:32,198
is a very worthwhile video for all of you.

16
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,479
Please pay attention.

17
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:34,550
Do the homeworks.

18
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,880
Teams, let's link some of the
coverage and the reddit thread

19
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,396
and the other things
that came along with this

20
00:00:40,396 --> 00:00:41,949
incredible interview
with this wonderful kid

21
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:46,241
who has now got something very
good coming up in the future.

22
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:47,965
♫ It's legit, never quit

23
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,317
♫ I'm a different applicant

24
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,117
- So, man, you made it.

25
00:00:52,117 --> 00:00:52,950
- Yeah man.

26
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,342
- You figured it out.

27
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:56,191
Tell me the whole story.

28
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:58,250
- Alright, I'll start from the beginning.

29
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,867
I got, I got, I got,

30
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:02,992
I found out about you
through The Breakfast Club.

31
00:01:02,992 --> 00:01:04,236
- I'm gonna spell it out for you.

32
00:01:04,236 --> 00:01:07,069
G-O-O-G-L-E.

33
00:01:08,284 --> 00:01:11,407
Go to (bleep) Google and type
in, "How do I make money?"

34
00:01:11,407 --> 00:01:12,347
"How do I start a business?"

35
00:01:12,347 --> 00:01:13,491
There's a lot of things you can do.

36
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:17,521
- And through the Brilliant Edits podcast.

37
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:18,403
- But are you willing to bleed

38
00:01:18,403 --> 00:01:20,220
out of your fucking eyes for your dream?

39
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,712
The answer is, you're not,
'cause you're full of shit.

40
00:01:22,712 --> 00:01:24,471
- So I'd seen you on there,

41
00:01:24,471 --> 00:01:26,264
and I was digging what you were saying,

42
00:01:26,264 --> 00:01:28,755
and over the past, I don't know,

43
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,149
seven months since I discovered you,

44
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:32,934
I feel like sometimes you're tugging at me

45
00:01:32,934 --> 00:01:34,282
while I'm at work listening to you,

46
00:01:34,282 --> 00:01:35,720
like, "Man, you're gonna quit your job."

47
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,946
(laughter)

48
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:37,779
- Just like a voice?

49
00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:39,946
- Yeah, yeah, I like my
job, but I know that.

50
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:41,394
- What do you do?

51
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:44,430
- I work for a night club, Lava Nightclub.

52
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,263
It's under--

53
00:01:45,263 --> 00:01:46,096
- I know.

54
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:47,762
- Casino, you know?

55
00:01:47,762 --> 00:01:50,658
- I, pretty much, do all
the flyers and stuff.

56
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:52,822
Pretty much, I feel like I'm coming up.

57
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:53,655
- Design?

58
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,488
- Yeah.

59
00:01:54,488 --> 00:01:55,321
I feel like I'm turning into

60
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:56,154
a one trick pony.

61
00:01:56,154 --> 00:01:57,238
If I stay too long.

62
00:01:57,238 --> 00:01:58,779
- I get it.

63
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:02,279
♫ In that visual communications I got BFA.

64
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:03,551
Pretty much.

65
00:02:03,551 --> 00:02:05,971
- So I'm whispering in
your ear, virtually.

66
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:09,531
- Yeah, maybe about a week before

67
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:12,301
you guys put up the Are
You a Creator video.

68
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:14,182
- Calling all creators right now.

69
00:02:14,182 --> 00:02:15,782
I need to create a content army.

70
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:17,322
- There was a kid that used to work here.

71
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:18,737
His name was Pomsey.

72
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:21,642
And, by chance, I just happened

73
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,556
to get on YouTube and I seen this video

74
00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:27,764
about how he got the job at Vayner.

75
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:29,372
I just reached out to him on Instagram

76
00:02:29,372 --> 00:02:31,804
and I just offered him some value.

77
00:02:31,804 --> 00:02:34,589
I know video kids, they need graphics

78
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:35,429
just to save them time.

79
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:36,846
So I'm like, "Hey man, I'll do something

80
00:02:36,846 --> 00:02:40,007
"like lower third graphics for
you or something, whatever."

81
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:43,288
And then, he was down with it.

82
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,750
It didn't end up working how we

83
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:49,062
wanted it to but we kept
in touch and everything.

84
00:02:49,062 --> 00:02:52,454
From there, I was just
trying to figure out

85
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:54,073
how I could do the same thing he did

86
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,509
but in my own way because I know

87
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,908
you guys said you have 150 applicants

88
00:02:58,908 --> 00:03:00,256
and 4,000 views and I'm like,

89
00:03:00,256 --> 00:03:02,285
how the heck am I gonna stand out.

90
00:03:02,285 --> 00:03:04,153
And I know you like rap music.

91
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:07,651
I was like man, if he could hear me spit

92
00:03:07,651 --> 00:03:09,616
I think he'd be impressed.

93
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:11,283
♫ You should hire me not simply

94
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:13,331
♫ 'Cause I mailed an inquiry

95
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:16,944
♫ Because it ain't a secret ♫
You won't find this in a diary

96
00:03:16,944 --> 00:03:17,981
- So you made the video?

97
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:21,071
- Yes, I made the video
super, super low budget.

98
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:22,610
Not fancy at all.

99
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,421
I shot it on my iPhone.

100
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:25,256
- The way I like it.

101
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:26,089
- Yeah, I went to a studio that's,

102
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:28,218
probably, as fancy as I got.

103
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:29,386
- So you rented studio space?

104
00:03:29,386 --> 00:03:30,651
- Yeah, yeah.

105
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:31,990
- Where?

106
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,331
- There's this studio in Syracuse

107
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:36,081
called SubCat Videos.

108
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:38,827
Did the song there.

109
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:39,894
- Where do you live?

110
00:03:39,894 --> 00:03:41,644
- I live in Syracuse.

111
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,110
Pretty much do the video.

112
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,240
I wasn't going to put it up when

113
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,889
I submitted the application to you guys,

114
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:49,795
it was like.

115
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:50,830
- A private link to that.

116
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,839
- Yeah, yeah but the Pomsey Kid.

117
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:54,999
I asked him what he thought about it

118
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:58,117
and he's like, "Man, his could go viral."

119
00:03:58,117 --> 00:04:00,034
Go figure and I'm like,

120
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:03,222
it's cool and all but at the same time,

121
00:04:03,222 --> 00:04:04,463
it's, kind of, silly.

122
00:04:04,463 --> 00:04:05,296
- I get it.

123
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:07,182
- People might hate on it or whatever.

124
00:04:07,182 --> 00:04:08,609
But I take his advise.

125
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:11,917
I put it on YouTube, no traction.

126
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:13,921
It's like super slow.

127
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,067
I'm like digging on LinkedIn trying

128
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:17,898
to figure out who I can email here

129
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,651
'cause I felt like I just needed

130
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:20,808
somebody to sit in.

131
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:22,225
- Yeah of course.

132
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:24,907
- A friend of mine, he's' like,

133
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:26,648
"Hey man, you want me
to post it on reddit?"

134
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:27,795
I'm familiar with reddit.

135
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:31,687
I know if you can do something on reddit.

136
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:32,868
- The internet notices.

137
00:04:32,868 --> 00:04:33,701
- Yeah, yeah.

138
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:36,311
So we toss it on reddit.

139
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:38,969
Like 30 minutes, get like 150 views.

140
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:40,118
I'm going nuts.

141
00:04:40,118 --> 00:04:41,312
I can't, really, focus at work.

142
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:42,496
I'm sneaking on my phone,

143
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:44,579
oh my God, this is crazy.

144
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:48,121
From there it just blew up.

145
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,454
It's like 1.2 million views right now.

146
00:04:51,454 --> 00:04:53,715
I'm just still trying to get
about how to do it again.

147
00:04:53,715 --> 00:04:54,548
- I get it.

148
00:04:54,548 --> 00:04:57,380
We all feel that after it happens.

149
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,597
So it went to 150 views

150
00:04:59,597 --> 00:05:02,837
and, literally, you were just
refreshing every little bit?

151
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:04,115
- Yeah, my friends were just texting me,

152
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:05,665
Bro, it's on Worldstar now.

153
00:05:05,665 --> 00:05:08,821
It's at 10,000 views,
it's at blah, blah, blah.

154
00:05:08,821 --> 00:05:09,812
♫ Wasn't born with this

155
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:10,645
♫ I've grown with this

156
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:11,478
♫ Throughout my education

157
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,238
♫ ♫ I perform with this on daily basis

158
00:05:14,238 --> 00:05:16,396
♫ I be detonating

159
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:18,476
I'm stoked but at the same time,

160
00:05:18,476 --> 00:05:20,583
I couldn't even focus.

161
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,133
It's just so crazy.

162
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:23,442
- You been in a haze for a week?

163
00:05:23,442 --> 00:05:24,525
- Yeah, yeah.

164
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:28,176
- So now you're here.

165
00:05:28,176 --> 00:05:29,657
- Yeah, yeah, so now I'm here.

166
00:05:29,657 --> 00:05:31,084
Trying to see where it goes.

167
00:05:31,084 --> 00:05:33,748
- So were people reaching out to you

168
00:05:33,748 --> 00:05:34,973
that you haven't talked to in a while?

169
00:05:34,973 --> 00:05:36,306
- Yeah, aunties.

170
00:05:37,911 --> 00:05:39,826
"Hey, I always knew that you."

171
00:05:39,826 --> 00:05:42,758
- (laughs) I love it.

172
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:44,666
- I'm taking it all in 'cause I still

173
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,478
don't feel like but it's cool

174
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:48,531
but I didn't do anything.

175
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:49,437
I'd do it again.

176
00:05:49,437 --> 00:05:50,787
- I get it, I get it.

177
00:05:50,787 --> 00:05:53,503
- I'm not trying to let it get to my head.

178
00:05:53,503 --> 00:05:54,714
- Yeah of course.

179
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:56,061
One viral video.

180
00:05:56,061 --> 00:05:58,037
As you, you're smart, you get it.

181
00:05:58,037 --> 00:06:00,064
There's a lot of people
that have done that.

182
00:06:00,064 --> 00:06:02,283
It's about what you do next
and next and next and next.

183
00:06:02,283 --> 00:06:03,512
- Exactly, yeah.

184
00:06:03,512 --> 00:06:05,416
- So what would you like to happen?

185
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,304
You want to get a job here?

186
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:07,137
- Yeah.

187
00:06:07,137 --> 00:06:07,970
- You'll move down here?

188
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:08,803
- Yeah.

189
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:09,636
♫ Still live at my mama house

190
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,337
♫ But I'm cool with moving out

191
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,650
♫ To the Big Apple working for you

192
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,199
♫ Yeah I'm cool with that

193
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,892
- Okay and what do you want to do, design?

194
00:06:17,892 --> 00:06:20,031
And learn all the other stuff?

195
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:22,407
Designs your core skill that you've had.

196
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:23,271
And then you want to learn whatever

197
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:24,420
the fuck else you can learn?

198
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,473
- Yeah, I kind of want.

199
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:28,421
♫ Every time I get behind computer

200
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,839
♫ I make a souffle

201
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,432
♫ I can fix you homie website

202
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,236
♫ I can even illustrate

203
00:06:33,236 --> 00:06:35,946
I don't know, just dabble in things.

204
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:39,331
I know you have the team (mumbles).

205
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:41,220
I think I'm capable of handling

206
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,150
that kind of work. ♫ I'm a hard
worker and you can criticize

207
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,784
♫ And I won't take it personal

208
00:06:47,784 --> 00:06:50,307
♫ I know there's room to rise

209
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:53,124
And then, I can show
you something actually.

210
00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:53,957
- Please.

211
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:55,540
Tyler, get me Andy.

212
00:06:57,705 --> 00:07:00,004
- Brian Frost for Inventor Sports,

213
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:01,996
had me do a test project.

214
00:07:01,996 --> 00:07:03,782
So this is something for.

215
00:07:03,782 --> 00:07:04,615
- Yep, yep.

216
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:05,913
- You guys don't have em or whatever but.

217
00:07:05,913 --> 00:07:06,746
- Yep.

218
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:08,108
- He just asked me to see what

219
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:12,222
I could do with a video
more like a (mumbles).

220
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:14,194
I just, basically, just did a timeline

221
00:07:14,194 --> 00:07:15,513
kind of concept for em.

222
00:07:15,513 --> 00:07:18,757
Just to highlight that first.

223
00:07:18,757 --> 00:07:21,889
The youngest guy to score
a touchdown since 1964.

224
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:24,395
And then is you slide.

225
00:07:24,395 --> 00:07:25,228
Oh yeah, you already seen that.

226
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:26,811
- It's really cool.

227
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:29,244
- So that's what I did for him.

228
00:07:29,244 --> 00:07:30,077
- I like it.

229
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:31,717
- I think I could do that stuff too.

230
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:34,618
- Something he mocked
up for that beaner ass.

231
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:35,451
Did you see this?

232
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:36,284
- It's nice.

233
00:07:36,284 --> 00:07:39,451
- Yeah, I like the second piece a lot.

234
00:07:41,723 --> 00:07:44,053
- I was, really, impressed with

235
00:07:44,053 --> 00:07:46,752
the stuff that he sent
for you too actually.

236
00:07:46,752 --> 00:07:47,585
- Did you see that song?

237
00:07:47,585 --> 00:07:48,418
- I haven't yet.

238
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:49,251
- Okay.

239
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:52,316
- Yeah, you did it quickly.

240
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:56,249
He's from (mumbles), some jiffs.

241
00:07:56,249 --> 00:07:57,374
- I don't remember which video it is.

242
00:07:57,374 --> 00:07:59,396
- Can we please keep calling them gifs?

243
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,595
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

244
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:01,822
I know it's been, officially, rebranded

245
00:08:01,822 --> 00:08:04,322
but I'm still pissed about it.

246
00:08:05,203 --> 00:08:08,563
Okay, I mean where are we at with design?

247
00:08:08,563 --> 00:08:09,748
I know you got a couple of people.

248
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:12,202
- [Andy] Yeah, it's a
combo that we can have.

249
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:14,005
There's a female Monica.

250
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:18,782
Ceaser starts this week
but he's more illustrator

251
00:08:18,782 --> 00:08:21,123
than I had him pegged
to and we can debate.

252
00:08:21,123 --> 00:08:21,956
- Okay.

253
00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:23,250
♫ I hope to emphasize

254
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,828
♫ That for the job I'm fit

255
00:08:24,828 --> 00:08:26,225
♫ And if you're pennywise

256
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:28,594
♫ Then you'll realize I'm really it

257
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:30,485
And I'll say I'm pro Photoshop.

258
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:31,318
- What's that?

259
00:08:31,318 --> 00:08:32,578
♫ I'm a real counterpuncher

260
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,506
♫ I am not a counterfeit

261
00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:35,856
I'm more Photoshop than illustrator.

262
00:08:35,857 --> 00:08:37,755
- Listen, we need hard core design.

263
00:08:37,755 --> 00:08:39,275
♫ Yes I'm cruising for a bruising

264
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:41,226
♫ I know winning comes with loosing

265
00:08:41,226 --> 00:08:42,474
- Like, what you just made there

266
00:08:42,474 --> 00:08:43,308
and if he's impressed.

267
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:45,764
If we can pull it off, we
could move quickly here.

268
00:08:45,764 --> 00:08:46,828
Can you pull it up?

269
00:08:46,828 --> 00:08:47,661
- Yeah.

270
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:48,862
- Can you pull it up while we talk?

271
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,171
I mean I think that's our
biggest need right now.

272
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:53,004
- [Andy] Yeah it is.

273
00:08:53,004 --> 00:08:54,488
- I mean right?

274
00:08:54,488 --> 00:08:56,116
- [Andy] Yeah and then there's

275
00:08:56,116 --> 00:09:00,108
the secondary combo is the
media account creators.

276
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:00,941
- Right.

277
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:01,774
- [Andy] You know what I mean?

278
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:02,987
- Yeah, of course I do.

279
00:09:02,987 --> 00:09:06,224
- This is from Daily (mumbles)

280
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:10,183
and this was just a content I
built around striking things.

281
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:13,100
I thought you said throughout that.

282
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,714
Just like meme stuff but then.

283
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:17,611
♫ But enough of my lips moving

284
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:19,275
♫ Hire me let's get to proving

285
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:22,192
- The eat shit that was real funny.

286
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:33,171
Yeah man, I think we should do it.

287
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:34,004
I think it's a funny story

288
00:09:34,004 --> 00:09:36,446
for everybody on the internet.

289
00:09:36,446 --> 00:09:38,465
I think he's, clearly, got the skills

290
00:09:38,465 --> 00:09:39,445
to be able to do it.

291
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,167
And more importantly, I think that we can

292
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:44,013
motivate millions of people to go

293
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:45,524
and get there's too.

294
00:09:45,524 --> 00:09:47,219
I think we owe it to him

295
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,141
and I think we owe it to them

296
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:50,334
to make this hire.

297
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:52,862
I think it'll make the
full circle feel real good.

298
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:54,445
When can you start?

299
00:09:55,691 --> 00:09:57,718
- I would ask for, maybe, just a month

300
00:09:57,718 --> 00:09:59,142
just so I don't leave.

301
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:00,115
- Yeah you got stuff to do.

302
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:00,948
Plus you got to figure out where

303
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:01,781
you're gonna live and everything.

304
00:10:01,781 --> 00:10:02,621
- Yeah, yeah.

305
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:03,508
- Alright, so why don't you guys

306
00:10:03,508 --> 00:10:05,963
talk details of price and everything

307
00:10:05,963 --> 00:10:07,479
so he can have some time to figure it out.

308
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:10,491
But I'd be okay with him joining the team.

309
00:10:10,491 --> 00:10:12,241
- Okay, that's sweet.

310
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:14,205
Man, thank you man.

311
00:10:14,205 --> 00:10:15,038
- You're welcome.

312
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:15,871
So why don't you guys talk details

313
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:17,881
right now while I go to my next meetings.

314
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:19,770
And let me know if there's any friction.

315
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,944
If he can afford it, he can't afford it.

316
00:10:20,944 --> 00:10:22,937
Anything that's logistically needed.

317
00:10:22,937 --> 00:10:23,770
- Alright.

318
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,603
- Alright?

319
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:25,436
- Hey thank you man.

320
00:10:25,436 --> 00:10:26,269
- Your welcome man, congrats.

321
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:27,102
- Hey, thank you.

322
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:29,593
- Good, you guys go jam.

323
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:32,070
♫ Count

324
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,320
- And that's how you do it.

325
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:37,185
That's pretty cool.

326
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:38,971
♫ I got, I got, I got

327
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,639
