1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:04,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the master collection define</font>

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,570
cool something that I can relate to that

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,920
I a<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh yeah and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so like if we asked</font>

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,120
everybody I'm sure everybody's doing it

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,770
through their mind right it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tough</font>

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,160
thing to explain but I actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,020
creative has to be cool and I think

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,460
we're who comes in for me is relevance

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,349
relevance is a very poor piece of that

10
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,750
relevance really mad so here's what I

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,420
think relevance<font color="#E5E5E5"> + value equals where I</font>

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,550
think that world that's all I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,610
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do I bring value I could have</font>

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,219
came up here did my thing for 45 minutes

15
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the life gave you the same thing</font>

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I normally do and a lot of you</font>

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,750
would have been pumped because you would

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,610
have said oh I finally got to see it in

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">person and it would have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> felt different</font>

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,420
I've been shocked I'm so thankful that

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,250
people scream I ketone nine times and

22
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,660
still love<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know it's like that</font>

23
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,000
comedian<font color="#CCCCCC"> Leveson obviously Chris Rock 38</font>

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,829
times a drug i'd get it but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

25
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">what brings more value what we're doing</font>

26
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,939
right now like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love Jess but</font>

27
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,650
I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want him to like I want you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

28
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,850
get this this is value I think access is

29
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,890
going to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very valuable thing going</font>

30
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,049
forward above content but I think

31
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,170
relevance really matters like you know

32
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,479
context knowing what's happening like

33
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,670
you know that thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so valuable right</font>

34
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,619
and I think brands and businesses and

35
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,350
entrepreneurs<font color="#E5E5E5"> is everybody not going to</font>

36
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,780
be cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they have to be cool the</font>

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">definition it cool for the demo they're</font>

38
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,290
trying to sell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have to know</font>

39
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,880
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while every TV back to the</font>

40
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that aren't here for that it</font>

41
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,540
really worked because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reviewing</font>

42
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,150
wine but I was throwing in pop<font color="#CCCCCC"> culture</font>

43
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,040
references that were happening in the

44
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,560
world at that moment that made it for

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,479
the younger demo<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem a little cooler</font>

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,090
here's a wine guy that talks about acts

47
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,159
like I was talking about fart you know

48
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,570
vast some gossip girl at its height

49
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,090
lot of people especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and so you</font>

50
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,670
know so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where it's going</font>

51
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think that the cost of being of</font>

52
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,020
successful creative has been pushed very

53
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,179
heavy into relevance to the value and

54
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:10,399
less on just pushing something down

55
00:02:10,399 --> 00:00:00,000
someone's throat thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you yeah</font>
