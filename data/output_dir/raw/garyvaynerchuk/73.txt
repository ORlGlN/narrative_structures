1
00:00:00,108 --> 00:00:01,713
- Nothing would make me happier

2
00:00:01,713 --> 00:00:04,262
than to post this clip 14 months from now

3
00:00:04,262 --> 00:00:06,818
when you and J Balvin and Bieber

4
00:00:06,818 --> 00:00:08,616
have got a song that
is number one on iTunes

5
00:00:08,616 --> 00:00:11,999
and I'm gonna be like, "Yo! I
was a part of that process!"

6
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:13,223
(laughter)

7
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:15,011
And I know it can happen.

8
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:18,011
Here's why, you're an actual artist.

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,063
(upbeat music)

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,838
- [Gary] What's going on?

11
00:00:27,838 --> 00:00:28,692
- [Hannah] Not much is going on.

12
00:00:28,692 --> 00:00:30,417
I'm really enjoying working here.

13
00:00:30,417 --> 00:00:31,250
- That makes me happy.

14
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,313
- [Hannah] I've been here for
a year and two months now.

15
00:00:33,313 --> 00:00:34,726
And I really, really like it.

16
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:36,533
- And so what's been
the best part of Vayner?

17
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:38,899
- [Hannah] I think just
the people and the team.

18
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:41,874
I feel like that is kind of
somewhat of a cliche answer.

19
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:43,261
I also think the people --

20
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:46,997
- I also truly believe if people
are happy that is our truth

21
00:00:46,997 --> 00:00:47,934
What can I help you with?

22
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:49,720
- [Hannah] You inspire
so many people each day

23
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,813
for your content and your
commenting back on your videos.

24
00:00:52,813 --> 00:00:55,730
Who inspires you the most each day?

25
00:00:58,588 --> 00:01:01,803
- The community as a whole is
the inspiration I think for me

26
00:01:01,803 --> 00:01:05,636
I'm not easily inspired.
I don't, I think I'm,

27
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,609
I don't know. I feel like I'm almost like,

28
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:13,435
you know how like the
batteries have the two sides?

29
00:01:13,435 --> 00:01:15,307
Like the A/B --
- [Hannah] Yeah.

30
00:01:15,307 --> 00:01:17,959
- I feel like I'm the
reverse. I feel like that

31
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:21,583
already had happened or
was hardwired into me.

32
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,023
I've never, I don't even know,

33
00:01:24,023 --> 00:01:27,360
I've never been inspired
the way I inspire others.

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,154
I've never, I think,

35
00:01:29,154 --> 00:01:32,576
it's very interesting, that's not true

36
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:34,943
at non-profit events I
can get very inspired

37
00:01:34,943 --> 00:01:37,711
where human beings are
doing real things for life

38
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:40,794
but not in a business-y kind of like,

39
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:44,585
not in business, not in career, you know.

40
00:01:44,585 --> 00:01:46,620
- [Hannah] Yeah, the question
was more like generally.

41
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,149
- Generally, what I am most
inspired by is the hardest

42
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:50,658
emails that I have in my inbox,

43
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:54,825
which is "I'm a single mother of two.

44
00:01:55,803 --> 00:01:57,833
"I'm working three jobs.

45
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:00,755
"I read 'Crush It' on
the night shift of this.

46
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:03,432
"Do you think I could
start a jewelry brand?"

47
00:02:03,432 --> 00:02:05,383
You know, that's just like, fuck, right?

48
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:06,216
- [Hannah] Yeah

49
00:02:06,216 --> 00:02:08,435
- I'm like, people are complaining about

50
00:02:08,435 --> 00:02:10,392
it's hard to make more content,

51
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:12,279
and I'm like mother fucker,

52
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:14,337
this woman has got like --

53
00:02:14,337 --> 00:02:16,497
sees her kids for an hour
a day cause she works

54
00:02:16,497 --> 00:02:19,140
21 hours a day, not 15,

55
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,030
and not out of the shit
she's aspiring to do,

56
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,692
out of like providing.
- [Hannah] Right.

57
00:02:24,692 --> 00:02:26,879
- I'm very inspired by people that

58
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,597
are suffocated out of options

59
00:02:29,597 --> 00:02:31,915
and still have the fucking
intestinal fortitude

60
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:35,014
to bite their lip, put their head down

61
00:02:35,014 --> 00:02:37,174
and fucking try to grind
for the next 17 years,

62
00:02:37,174 --> 00:02:40,265
just to get a vacation one day.

63
00:02:40,265 --> 00:02:43,476
That inspires me tremendously.
Cause that's hard.

64
00:02:43,476 --> 00:02:46,610
- [Hannah] Yeah
- I'm inspired when it's hard.

65
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,718
- I'm not inspired by "Woe is
me. I can't find my passion."

66
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:53,037
You know (shrugs).
- [Hannah] Yeah.

67
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:53,870
- I'm just not --

68
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,474
- [Hannah] I get what you're saying.

69
00:02:55,474 --> 00:02:56,307
- Awesome.

70
00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:57,219
- [Hannah] Thank you for your time.

71
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,052
- Thank you. Have a great day.

72
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,209
- [Hannah] Have fun with your day.

73
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:01,122
- In terms of just the
one world in general,

74
00:03:01,122 --> 00:03:04,346
is there any overarching advice or --

75
00:03:04,346 --> 00:03:07,712
- No man, you know what,
yes, there is one thing.

76
00:03:07,712 --> 00:03:09,297
The reason I think I did really well.

77
00:03:09,297 --> 00:03:10,922
I think this company does really well,

78
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:12,466
and this will be good
with any comeback round,

79
00:03:12,466 --> 00:03:16,496
is the wine world is not consumer-centric.

80
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,539
The wine world's about the wine world.

81
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:19,841
And that's why they all fucking lose.

82
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:21,756
And very honestly, the business world's

83
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:22,811
about the business world.

84
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:25,371
They worry about themselves,
not about the actual customer,

85
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,119
and that's why companies like Amazon,

86
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:30,337
or people like me, win so much.

87
00:03:30,337 --> 00:03:33,688
Because when you actually
are consumer-centric,

88
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:35,066
- [Billy] Hear what you're saying.

89
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:37,102
- So the more you can help
them be consumer-centric,

90
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:39,052
care about what people
are pairing wines with,

91
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,595
how they're drinking them,

92
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,858
in what environments, in what packaging.

93
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:46,384
Not you've decided the story is

94
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:49,771
the dog did this, or the
malolactic fermentation that,

95
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,886
or this is how many months, got it?

96
00:03:51,886 --> 00:03:53,105
Everybody decides their story

97
00:03:53,105 --> 00:03:56,813
and tries to ram it down the
throat, instead of listening.

98
00:03:56,813 --> 00:03:58,315
So I'll give you a big piece of advice,

99
00:03:58,315 --> 00:04:02,951
go out a lot and go to
wine places and listen.

100
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,537
- [Billy] Do you --
- I won 'cause I sat

101
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:06,123
behind a register for years,

102
00:04:06,123 --> 00:04:08,402
and watched the people
interact in a store,

103
00:04:08,402 --> 00:04:09,908
and then had the ability to translate

104
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:12,480
that intuition and understanding

105
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,880
into how we interact with technology.

106
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,725
The end.

107
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:18,315
- [Bridget] Nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

108
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:19,148
- [Bridget] I'm Bridget.

109
00:04:19,148 --> 00:04:20,190
- Bridget, it's such a pleasure.

110
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,816
- Kind of just wanted to pick your brain

111
00:04:21,817 --> 00:04:23,485
for what 2018 is gonna look like.

112
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:25,760
I've heard you say it's gonna be amazing,

113
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,878
and I just wanna hear what's so exciting?

114
00:04:27,878 --> 00:04:29,101
What's coming down the line?

115
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:31,586
- I think the world's coming to us.

116
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:34,836
So (audio cuts out) --

117
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:37,409
and the deal flow of companies

118
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,322
that want us to give strategies

119
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,439
and then creative executions.

120
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:43,066
People want Facebook videos.

121
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,941
People want Alexa skills.

122
00:04:44,941 --> 00:04:47,753
People want influencer
programs on Instagram.

123
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:49,385
They don't want billboards.

124
00:04:49,385 --> 00:04:51,788
They don't want programmatic banner ads.

125
00:04:51,788 --> 00:04:54,961
I think our contemporary
nature of marketing

126
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,293
is feeling more practical

127
00:04:58,293 --> 00:05:01,361
to the biggest companies in
the world, not futuristic.

128
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:03,804
We will benefit
disproportionately for that.

129
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,984
- [Bridget] Cool.

130
00:05:04,984 --> 00:05:06,084
Awesome.
- Thanks.

131
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:07,826
- [Bridget] Thanks so much for your time.

132
00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:08,678
- Have a great day.

133
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:09,511
What up, vlog?

134
00:05:09,511 --> 00:05:10,927
Kim and I from Vayner Experience

135
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,510
are talking about Cannes next year.

136
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,217
What are the dates?

137
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:17,672
- [Man] June 18th through June 22nd.

138
00:05:17,672 --> 00:05:19,637
- June 18th to June 22nd,

139
00:05:19,637 --> 00:05:21,514
we're debating our overall strategy.

140
00:05:21,514 --> 00:05:25,148
I'm gonna do a little biz
dev Sunday on Thursday.

141
00:05:25,148 --> 00:05:26,575
We're thinking about putting on a series.

142
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:28,277
I'm looking for sponsorship of people

143
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:29,901
that are trying to get
into the marketing world,

144
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:32,192
if you have a SAS product,
things of that nature.

145
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:34,395
Basically deciding two
very different paths.

146
00:05:34,395 --> 00:05:39,072
One is gonna require me
creating a 400,000 dollar event,

147
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:42,445
so between sponsorships and dinner series.

148
00:05:42,445 --> 00:05:43,627
I'm just throwing this out there.

149
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:45,013
And this is obviously for only one percent

150
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:46,556
of the people watching,
but if you are trying

151
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:48,744
to tap into the marketing world,

152
00:05:48,744 --> 00:05:50,245
or the big brand worlds, and you are

153
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:52,611
a start-up with SAS products or a service,

154
00:05:52,611 --> 00:05:53,915
or things of that now.

155
00:05:53,915 --> 00:05:55,496
From an international standpoint,

156
00:05:55,496 --> 00:05:58,221
a lot of European watchers right now.

157
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:00,461
Feel free to send an email to here.

158
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:05,450
Cannes biz or biz Cannes,
I'll just come up with it.

159
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,709
Vaynercannes@vaynermedia.com, create it.

160
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:13,673
Vaynercannes, it'll be
spelled here, C-A-N-N-E-S.

161
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:17,583
At Vaynermedia.com, if you
are looking to sponsor,

162
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,227
and don't waste your time because

163
00:06:19,227 --> 00:06:22,321
it's more valuable to you,
definitely Kim's time.

164
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:23,750
We're looking for sponsors

165
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,123
with 25,000 to 400,000 dollar packages.

166
00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:28,999
We'll put on dinners. We'll put on events.

167
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:31,270
But I'm going to decide
in the next week or so

168
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,816
what our strategy is.

169
00:06:32,816 --> 00:06:36,394
Fuck it. Let me jam with you
guys, so see what happens.

170
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:39,564
- Daily Vee over the holidays,
what are we doing today?

171
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:40,936
- I'd like you three to get fucking busy

172
00:06:40,936 --> 00:06:42,760
and put out, make some fucking films.

173
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,260
- [Man] That's what I thought.

174
00:06:46,301 --> 00:06:49,313
- [Kim] (laughs) Do it
again and (mumbles).

175
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:51,730
(both laugh)

176
00:06:53,172 --> 00:06:55,002
- [Dennis] You are (mumbles).

177
00:06:55,002 --> 00:06:55,937
- How are you, man?

178
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:56,964
It's a real pleasure.

179
00:06:56,964 --> 00:06:58,757
- [Dennis] I'm tired
after 30 hours of flying.

180
00:06:58,757 --> 00:06:59,731
- Yeah, that's a beast.

181
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:00,693
Please sit.

182
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:02,400
To your point, it's a smart observation.

183
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,540
Once you fucking ladder this
up to a global conversation,

184
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,940
it becomes real fucking interesting.

185
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,363
And you've done that with your brand,

186
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:11,153
you took it to a global level,

187
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:13,435
which then let's you play different chess,

188
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:16,371
because I'm sure if we
looked at the fucking score,

189
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:18,084
where your brand sits in Chile

190
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:19,917
versus where it sits in Singapore,

191
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:21,948
where it sits in Detroit,

192
00:07:21,948 --> 00:07:26,458
they're gonna just be
fucking different matrix.

193
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,505
- [Woman] Whatever Stu wants to do along

194
00:07:28,505 --> 00:07:29,578
with his brand, I think --

195
00:07:29,578 --> 00:07:30,892
- Would he do it the way that I do it,

196
00:07:30,892 --> 00:07:32,564
where I have people following me around,

197
00:07:32,564 --> 00:07:34,682
and they're just chopping up the content.

198
00:07:34,682 --> 00:07:36,107
Would you do that, Dennis?

199
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:37,414
- Never slightly do that.

200
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:40,028
- I mean, look, I've built
my entire thing, Dennis,

201
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:42,273
100 percent through this fucking thing.

202
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:44,447
Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, podcasts.

203
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:47,350
Dennis is culture,

204
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,632
literally as long as
he's, to your point, seen.

205
00:07:50,632 --> 00:07:54,483
I know that Dennis, on a
Facebook watch and a podcast,

206
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:58,368
gets seen way more than
any reality show execution

207
00:07:58,368 --> 00:08:01,918
to produce unlimited amount
of content around Dennis,

208
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:04,013
that Dennis gets to approve,

209
00:08:04,013 --> 00:08:07,243
for Instagram, Snapchat,
podcasts, YouTube.

210
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:09,993
That's the fucking game. The end.

211
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,265
Now what's different though,

212
00:08:12,265 --> 00:08:14,520
of a reality show or one you do it,

213
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,031
is you're always catching everything.

214
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:18,190
You're not scared to be your full self,

215
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,969
because you're in charge
of post-production.

216
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:22,560
I'm literally myself all the time

217
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,927
because I'm in charge of what pumps out.

218
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:26,848
I'm like, "Iris, don't put that in there."

219
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:29,571
Done. There's no debate.

220
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:33,268
So the control of the fucking content

221
00:08:33,268 --> 00:08:34,707
is the game.
- [Dennis] Yeah.

222
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:37,412
- The reason this will work
for you more than anybody

223
00:08:37,413 --> 00:08:39,831
is the truth is the only
thing that fucking wins.

224
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:41,120
- [Dennis] You not build this brand

225
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,004
- 100 percent.

226
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:42,932
- [Dennis] I can't just be myself.

227
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:43,914
- [Chris] Oh no you did it yourself.

228
00:08:43,914 --> 00:08:45,476
- 100 percent. You took attention,

229
00:08:45,476 --> 00:08:47,458
and you reversed the
leverage in your favor.

230
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,577
Period. End of story.
I understand it cold.

231
00:08:49,577 --> 00:08:53,530
When you were doing it,
now, now the key though is,

232
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,894
what you had back in the day, Dennis,

233
00:08:55,894 --> 00:08:57,974
was you had distribution.

234
00:08:57,974 --> 00:08:59,946
You had people watching.

235
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:02,065
What you need is to
control people watching,

236
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:03,857
and the same shit will happen again.

237
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:05,489
That's all.

238
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:07,227
Hogan was the biggest
thing in the fucking world

239
00:09:07,227 --> 00:09:09,407
from '84 to '87, when
everybody was watching.

240
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:13,082
He wasn't in 1993, then
fucking wrestling came back,

241
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:15,945
and everybody gave a fuck
in '96 to '98, and he was.

242
00:09:15,945 --> 00:09:17,428
It's just attention.

243
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:20,118
Dennis is a top hundred famous person,

244
00:09:20,118 --> 00:09:23,535
whenever he has people actually watching.

245
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,913
(high fives) My man.

246
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:28,862
Where are you with music, like mentally?

247
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:31,299
- Mentally I'm a hundred percent.

248
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:32,889
- [Gary] Meaning you
want to produce projects?

249
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:33,985
- Absolutely.

250
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:35,947
- You just need to make,
because what's crazy

251
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:37,859
about the kind of talent you have,

252
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:40,098
and the status you have (shrugs).

253
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:43,743
You're just one bar away from
everything changing again.

254
00:09:43,743 --> 00:09:45,946
That's just crazy to me, right?

255
00:09:45,946 --> 00:09:47,581
What I don't know, and this is the truth,

256
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:49,176
is how fancy you are.

257
00:09:49,176 --> 00:09:50,607
And what I mean by fancy is

258
00:09:50,607 --> 00:09:54,092
how romantic you are about shit.

259
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:56,057
My intuition is you are romantic,

260
00:09:56,057 --> 00:09:58,236
'cause you should be,
- Absolutely.

261
00:09:58,236 --> 00:10:01,341
- And I wanna reframe the romance.

262
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:03,465
- Is it in the same frame as passionate?

263
00:10:03,465 --> 00:10:05,639
- No. I would say passion you've got.

264
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,616
It's why you're gonna win.

265
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:08,904
I could see it comes through
in everything you do.

266
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:12,041
No, I mean you thinking
something isn't quality enough

267
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,306
for you to put your name on it,

268
00:10:13,306 --> 00:10:15,509
'cause you protected it so well.

269
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:17,592
And you not realizing it's all upside,

270
00:10:17,592 --> 00:10:20,000
and you're seeing it as downside.

271
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,500
- And that comes from my audience as well.

272
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:27,315
- 100 percent.
- My audience and we met on --

273
00:10:27,315 --> 00:10:29,258
We have a goal.
- And you know --

274
00:10:29,258 --> 00:10:31,550
My man, I know.
- We have a (mumbles).

275
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,597
- I'm ready, and honestly
here's my concern.

276
00:10:33,597 --> 00:10:35,810
I think they've put you in a cage.

277
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,477
- They probably did.
- They sure did, my man.

278
00:10:38,477 --> 00:10:39,583
- They probably did.
- They sure did.

279
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,055
And you know what happens
when you get in a cage,

280
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:42,555
you don't do shit.

281
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:45,966
- Probably just stay in a box.

282
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:49,133
- But you're in a cage, and I know it.

283
00:10:52,797 --> 00:10:55,692
And I'm just trying to make
you think of it as a macro,

284
00:10:55,692 --> 00:10:57,445
and I know why you're not,

285
00:10:57,445 --> 00:10:59,246
because of everything I've just said.

286
00:10:59,246 --> 00:11:02,019
There is no 77 year old hip-hop icon yet,

287
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:03,934
but I think that's what you are.

288
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:05,532
And if you thought that too, well then,

289
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:08,062
fuck, I've got a lot of work to do.

290
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:10,163
Instead of, that's what I did.

291
00:11:10,163 --> 00:11:12,199
That's a young man's game,

292
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:14,341
and I'm on to being an artist,

293
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,658
a philanthropist, an entrepreneur, got it?

294
00:11:17,658 --> 00:11:20,191
I don't believe that.

295
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,819
I think you could have the
number one record in the country.

296
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:24,115
Tomorrow.

297
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:25,865
- Stepping out of the box.

298
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:27,947
- Stepping out the box
that they put you in.

299
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:29,133
That you put yourself in.

300
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:31,464
That you and your man put yourself in.

301
00:11:31,464 --> 00:11:33,144
Step the fuck out,

302
00:11:33,144 --> 00:11:35,323
and nothing would make me happier

303
00:11:35,323 --> 00:11:37,826
than to post this clip 14 months from now,

304
00:11:37,826 --> 00:11:40,242
when you and J Balvin and Bieber

305
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,087
have got a song that's
number one on iTunes,

306
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:42,951
and I'm gonna be like,

307
00:11:42,951 --> 00:11:45,454
"Yo, I was a part of that process."

308
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,761
(laughter)

309
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:48,609
And I know it can happen.

310
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:50,077
Like, here's why.

311
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:52,077
You're an actual artist.

312
00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:56,710
You putting out a song that gets hot.

313
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,516
That's a foregone conclusion.

314
00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:00,558
You just need to get
the fuck out of the jail

315
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:02,725
that everybody put you in.

316
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,439
- This is the past
audience I got (chuckles).

317
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:09,706
- And guess what?

318
00:12:09,706 --> 00:12:11,382
They love you, and you love them.

319
00:12:11,382 --> 00:12:12,849
- [Redman] That's right.
- But guess what?

320
00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:14,884
I got shit on for not
being the wine guy anymore,

321
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:17,135
when I started talking about business

322
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:18,385
until I didn't.

323
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:22,470
I'm glad you came through, man.

324
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,409
- Appreciate you, boss.

325
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,719
- Did you understand?
- Yes.

326
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:25,823
- You gonna do something, you think?

327
00:12:25,823 --> 00:12:27,544
- Absolutely. Why wouldn't I?

328
00:12:27,544 --> 00:12:29,054
- I don't know, because it's fucking hard

329
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:30,807
to change up here sometimes.

330
00:12:30,807 --> 00:12:31,948
- [Man] Alright, let me just.

331
00:12:31,948 --> 00:12:35,598
- I think with the current
state of attention in podcasts.

332
00:12:35,598 --> 00:12:38,083
This is a question to
you as well, equally.

333
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,919
What excites the shit out of me with this

334
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:42,167
is that it's super
narrow, and what scares me

335
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:44,171
about the next one is that it's too broad.

336
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:47,139
And I think to win on
podcast in the current state,

337
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:48,739
it'd probably be very smart for us

338
00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:50,172
to go as narrow as possible.

339
00:12:50,172 --> 00:12:52,547
(upbeat music)

340
00:12:52,547 --> 00:12:53,810
- [Man] Okay, cool. Let's do this.

341
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,762
- Cool.
(upbeat music)

342
00:12:55,762 --> 00:12:57,238
Nay.

343
00:12:57,238 --> 00:12:59,664
What? (laughs)

344
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:00,645
What up, vlog?

345
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:03,885
Good day, just had a
brief PureWow meeting.

346
00:13:03,885 --> 00:13:05,760
Everybody's subscribed to PureWow.

347
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,125
Iris is killing it, Sid not as much.

348
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,042
