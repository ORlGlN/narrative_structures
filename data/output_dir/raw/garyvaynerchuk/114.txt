1
00:00:01,524 --> 00:00:02,357
- Yes.

2
00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:04,990
It's my favorite.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,573
We own the airport.

4
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:10,348
And that guy, sorry.

5
00:00:10,348 --> 00:00:13,181
(energetic music)

6
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:19,648
(soft music)

7
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:30,254
Friday morning, Chicago.

8
00:00:30,254 --> 00:00:31,087
The W.

9
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:33,395
Gorgeous outside.

10
00:00:33,395 --> 00:00:35,623
Three hardcore meetings.

11
00:00:35,623 --> 00:00:39,755
A schlep from Chicago
to the Milwaukee Airport

12
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:42,967
for a quick meeting and
probably not a whole lot

13
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:44,487
of filming for you, Babin,
so I'm gonna have to

14
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:46,589
come up with some sort of huge rant.

15
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:49,115
Vlog, some days are just boring for you

16
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:53,021
because they're exciting for
me 'cause I get to be the CEO

17
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:56,160
of the motherfucking marketing company

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,222
of the future and present,
they just don't know yet.

19
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:02,639
(soft music)

20
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:07,386
Sneakers are selling crazy on eBay.

21
00:01:07,386 --> 00:01:09,803
(soft music)

22
00:01:11,387 --> 00:01:12,220
'Sup, vlog.

23
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,154
Going into meeting number one.

24
00:01:13,154 --> 00:01:16,469
Big fortune 100 company in Chicago.

25
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:17,942
Babin can't come.

26
00:01:17,942 --> 00:01:19,139
Ryan can come.

27
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:21,556
(soft music)

28
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:27,000
Why are you stealing my clothes?

29
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,823
- We're staying.

30
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:35,184
(soft music)

31
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,996
(distant conversation)

32
00:01:40,996 --> 00:01:43,413
(soft music)

33
00:01:54,035 --> 00:01:55,411
- Dark Horse, big one?

34
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:57,828
(soft music)

35
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,154
(distant conversation)

36
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,545
Get some micro content, here.

37
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:10,606
Oh, you wanna be in it?

38
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:11,440
Oh.

39
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,824
(he laughs)
- No, I think that's fine.

40
00:02:12,824 --> 00:02:14,471
(soft music)

41
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:15,472
- Just not used to that.

42
00:02:15,472 --> 00:02:17,201
Or Babin's pumped with
you because he finally,

43
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:18,966
now he has an episode.

44
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:20,251
He has an episode.

45
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:22,092
- We're back live with Gary Vaynerchuk,

46
00:02:22,092 --> 00:02:24,602
Tyler Babin, Marcus, can't even--

47
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,435
- [Gary] Krzastek.

48
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:27,435
- Krzastek and Gary Vee.

49
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:32,394
Who is your idol in the
entrepreneurship business world?

50
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:33,227
- Nobody.

51
00:02:33,227 --> 00:02:34,060
Nobody.

52
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,893
Nobody.

53
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:36,378
But, I will say this.
- Yeah.

54
00:02:36,378 --> 00:02:39,556
- Well, because I never spend
time digging into anybody.

55
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:41,110
I always really stay
to the small, you know,

56
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,287
I was 34 years old when I kind of came out

57
00:02:44,287 --> 00:02:47,045
to the regular world 'cause
I was in the liquor business

58
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:48,670
in a family business in New Jersey.

59
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,745
Met no one.

60
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:50,978
We talk about this all the time.

61
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:53,432
I lived in this weird cocoon so I never,

62
00:02:53,432 --> 00:02:55,515
and I wasn't a good student or a reader.

63
00:02:55,515 --> 00:02:56,742
I had no network.

64
00:02:56,742 --> 00:02:58,000
I didn't even know.

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,269
I was so grossly undereducated,

66
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:03,319
that I didn't even know
to idolize anybody.

67
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,607
I idolized my parents.

68
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:07,512
I'm a nine, I always tell everybody,

69
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:11,850
I'm a 1950s immigrant much more
than, you know what I mean?

70
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,683
- [Man] Okay.

71
00:03:12,683 --> 00:03:13,978
- We lived very weird so nobody.

72
00:03:13,978 --> 00:03:15,958
That being said, I will say this.

73
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,673
I really do admire Richard Branson

74
00:03:17,673 --> 00:03:19,017
and I don't know a lot about him,

75
00:03:19,017 --> 00:03:20,767
so I'm gonna hedge it a little bit

76
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:25,426
but intuitively, the path of
building actual businesses

77
00:03:25,426 --> 00:03:27,783
while actually building a persona as well,

78
00:03:27,783 --> 00:03:31,950
and the, kind of, the way
that he made those two work,

79
00:03:33,118 --> 00:03:34,893
I think is something that I'm up to

80
00:03:34,893 --> 00:03:37,526
and so I gravitate towards that.

81
00:03:37,526 --> 00:03:38,359
- [Man] Alright.

82
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:39,236
Electric chair meal.

83
00:03:39,236 --> 00:03:40,182
You have one meal to go.

84
00:03:40,182 --> 00:03:41,729
What's the meal you eat?

85
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:43,023
- White Castle burgers.

86
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,525
(soft music)

87
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:46,146
- Yes.

88
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:47,984
It's my favorite.

89
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:49,567
We own the airport.

90
00:03:52,263 --> 00:03:53,159
And that guy, sorry.

91
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,409
(laughter)

92
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:04,045
- [Babin] Why did we bring
the girl from Chicago--

93
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:06,267
- Right so, good job, Babin.

94
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:07,435
Way to go on the set-up so here we are

95
00:04:07,435 --> 00:04:10,704
in the empty Milwaukee Airport

96
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:12,060
and gonna be home four hours later

97
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,716
because the big potential
client had a change of plans

98
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,952
and was like, let's
get together in January

99
00:04:18,952 --> 00:04:20,761
and sometimes you have to hack

100
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:22,920
because no time like the present, right?

101
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,796
Meeting in January in the
corporate business world means

102
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:26,824
maybe we'll do something in the summer,

103
00:04:26,824 --> 00:04:28,182
maybe we'll do something in 2019.

104
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:30,359
Meeting in October, or
excuse me, November,

105
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:31,648
means you could do something in 2018

106
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:33,645
so when that feedback came back,

107
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:36,360
I said, fuck it, let's take
a three hour, two hour,

108
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,772
actually that'd be an hour and a half.

109
00:04:37,772 --> 00:04:39,850
But a two hour drive and
we'll come to Milwaukee

110
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,004
and we'll have a meeting in the Starbucks

111
00:04:42,004 --> 00:04:44,036
and then we'll go on our merry way

112
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:45,986
so I get back to New
York four hours later,

113
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,850
which is not a preference
on a Friday night

114
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,153
but reality is is the
opportunity to strike was there

115
00:04:51,153 --> 00:04:52,500
and these are the decisions between

116
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,211
work life balance, right?

117
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,848
I'm weighing do I wanna get
home couple hours earlier

118
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:00,591
on a Friday night and
so I thought about it,

119
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,815
well the kids are actually gonna be in bed

120
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:04,016
one way or the other so I
lose out on that variable

121
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:04,876
and Lizzy and I are grown-ups.

122
00:05:04,876 --> 00:05:07,044
We could stay up later and
the Jets have a bi-week

123
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:10,836
this Sunday, so I'm
gonna be more all in on,

124
00:05:10,836 --> 00:05:14,336
and so, those are some
of the stuff in the,

125
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:15,823
that's how I made the decision of let's,

126
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:20,710
'cause the schlepping and
the hardcore and sleep,

127
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,349
like that stuff's easy.

128
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:23,893
I'll grind, I'm dirt.

129
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:24,726
I'm dirt.

130
00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:26,377
I'll do anything, any time, always.

131
00:05:26,377 --> 00:05:27,974
Humility to the fucking max.

132
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:32,212
I'm fuckin' absurdly
passionate and romantic

133
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:35,478
about three hours drives and
fuckin' two minute meetings

134
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:37,767
in the fuckin' gutter.

135
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:40,408
I'll meet you in the forest
if I think it's ROI positive

136
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:44,233
so I don't need to be fancy, you know?

137
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:48,731
I just need to get it done
in my work life environment.

138
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:50,805
(announcer speaking on telecom)

139
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:52,123
That's why we're in Milwaukee.

140
00:05:52,123 --> 00:05:53,423
Big up, Brewers.

141
00:05:53,423 --> 00:05:56,900
We're only fingers in the fucking house.

142
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,357
I actually love this.

143
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,524
It's the best.

144
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:03,120
I mean, not to visit, no no no no.

145
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,120
Where's my--

146
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,968
Guys I never forget, I don't
know what just happened.

147
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:12,751
I almost wanna look back at the film

148
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:13,741
'cause I have such a system.

149
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,328
By the way, fun fact, 'cause this is

150
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:16,810
becoming an interesting episode.

151
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,720
The system is if you can get to a place

152
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,172
where you always pat your pants,

153
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,539
I always pat my pants and I
make sure I have everything.

154
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:25,230
I don't know what I patted.

155
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,330
I guess, maybe the mic.

156
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,268
I did something that made me think,

157
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:30,871
I don't know what the hell just happened.

158
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:31,795
Anyway.

159
00:06:31,795 --> 00:06:32,997
(exhales)

160
00:06:32,997 --> 00:06:35,414
(soft music)

161
00:06:37,587 --> 00:06:39,847
Found a little opening here, so.

162
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:41,837
Vlog, I'm about to go live.

163
00:06:41,837 --> 00:06:44,032
Set your notifications.

164
00:06:44,032 --> 00:06:45,605
Oh, if you're wondering,
we haven't transformed it

165
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,757
to Airport Gary yet because
we have to have the meeting.

166
00:06:48,757 --> 00:06:50,816
Good afternoon, good afternoon.

167
00:06:50,816 --> 00:06:52,721
Good afternoon, Instagram.

168
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:54,615
Good to see you.

169
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:57,698
Ryan Harwood is here, CEO of PureWow.

170
00:06:58,822 --> 00:06:59,655
- Hey.

171
00:06:59,655 --> 00:07:00,488
How's it goin'?

172
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:01,321
- What do you got to say for yourself?

173
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,283
- Are you live right now?
- I'm live.

174
00:07:02,283 --> 00:07:03,675
- Uh, we're in Milwaukee.

175
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:04,855
- No no no, you shouldn't have,

176
00:07:04,855 --> 00:07:07,272
now people are gonna show up.

177
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,233
End video.

178
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:10,918
(he laughs)

179
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:13,335
(soft music)

180
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:19,472
Alright Milwaukee, the best
part of today's episode.

181
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:23,639
It is time for your favorite
