1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,149

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,770
much about you know never just always

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,559
pushing and doing as much as you can

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,700
what about none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your dad how do you</font>

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,660
turn off easily my family is everything

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,480
to me right by the way the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason I</font>

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,000
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about pushing and like you</font>

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,470
know this whole more like balance thing

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,779
is I know everybody you know you're

10
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,609
listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me for two minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and 37</font>

11
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,859
seconds on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube the rest of the time</font>

12
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,500
you're pushing very<font color="#CCCCCC"> often in the other</font>

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,090
direction we're all worried about life

14
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,520
work-life balance<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's by the way it's</font>

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the only thing I care about this was</font>

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,270
tough for me today this was this moment

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,160
has been very tough I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting through</font>

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,010
a tough moment right now now now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

19
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,480
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the fourth child between my</font>

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,920
sister and I I know that you don't have

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be there right that second to still</font>

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,510
have it but if this was our first like I

23
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,890
wouldn't be here I would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> cancelled</font>

24
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,570
like I've learned<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit like you</font>

25
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,100
know like you're always<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,960
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> making decisions do I let me work</font>

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,879
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> on all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the people that wanted to be</font>

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,010
here tonight is that the right value of

29
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,659
exchange for being there an hour<font color="#CCCCCC"> or two</font>

30
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,549
earlier like you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through these</font>

31
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">every day like I'm struggling with it</font>

32
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,210
every day<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'm also not spoken with</font>

33
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,220
it which is meaning we're all doing the

34
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,439
best we can write and nobody can tell

35
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,330

37
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,659
ever that I spent more<font color="#E5E5E5"> time than you so</font>

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,790
who won did he win like like we're all

40
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,900
is amazingly independent she's just

41
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,150
amazingly independent woman who like

42
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,430
this very similar to me it's like in her

43
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,170

44
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,210
doesn't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> me here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every second</font>

45
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,619
probably doesn't want me<font color="#CCCCCC"> there every</font>

46
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,840

49
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">real answer communication heavy over the</font>

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,500
top all in communication I check in with

51
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,659
her we talk about stuff I check in with

52
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:55,890
the rest of my family members and

53
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,229
friends you just have to talk a lot and

54
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,689
like because you're feeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> things they</font>

55
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:03,780
feeling I you know for a spouse you know

56
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,450
heavy communication for your children

57
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,008
when they're younger its heart can't

58
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:08,288
have

59
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:12,239
talk necessarily but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm super aware of</font>

60
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,829
the lack of time I spent with my dad

61
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:17,290
growing up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know until I was 14 I</font>

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,010
kid in my lead to not have his dad come

64

66
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,819
way you know like that just reliable so

67
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:29,079

68
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:31,180
