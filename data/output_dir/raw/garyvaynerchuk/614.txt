1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:02,834
Let's do it.

2
00:00:02,834 --> 00:00:04,583
Anybody have a question?

3
00:00:04,583 --> 00:00:05,417
- [Man] Who are the influencers

4
00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:08,333
that you like
listening to right now?

5
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:10,375
Are you listening to anyone or
are you just making up your own

6
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:12,291
stuff and you're good with that?

7
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:14,583
- Yeah.
(group laughter)

8
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:16,583
I genuinely, this is
like a straight up thing,

9
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,333
and you know it's funny,
did you guys see that

10
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,250
I posted my report card.

11
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,250
- [Group] Yeah.

12
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,583
That was a really interesting
insight to me which is I just

13
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,875
didn't realize how many
people didn't believe me.

14
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,041
I just continue to
not be believed.

15
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,375
It's my life.

16
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,875
I think people
think I'm exaggerating.

17
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:35,291
I think people thought I was a
B and C student and that was

18
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,583
really interesting
insight to me.

19
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,333
When I tell you that I've never
listen to anybody, I could not

20
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:44,750
tell you, I've never read a
line, a line of Seth Godin

21
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:50,500
content in my life and so
I genuinely believe with my

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,500
whole heart that that has
a lot to do with why I do well.

23
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:59,458
'Cause if you're consuming,
you're regurgitating and

24
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:03,625
everybody is consuming the same
shit and so I think the reason

25
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:04,917
I don't think I'm that smart.

26
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:07,625
I just think I say the same
stuff as other people I just

27
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,792
think that because I don't know
how it's actually said I came up

28
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:12,625
with my way of saying it and
that just might've worked for

29
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,625
people because they just
heard it a different way.

30
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:15,708
I genuinely believe that.

31
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,750
- [Man] Yeah.

32
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,041
- And so I think
that's interesting

33
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:19,750
and so I protect that.

34
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,166
I think I protected it through
school by getting D's and F's

35
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,750
and I think I protected
through the way I run my life

36
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,291
which is I consume you.

37
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:36,208
I consume your reactions you
know and that gives me insight.

38
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,792
So yeah, I don't really listen.

39
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,500
I don't need anything, you know?

40
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,333
- [Man] Is that what you
prescribe for other people too?

41
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,458
- If they can pull it off.

42
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,500
I just think I'm dramatically
more talented than other people.

43
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,625
- [Man] Yeah.

44
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:47,166
- [Man 2] What's it look
like for you to balance

45
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,834
business and family as well?

46
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:51,583
- It's a moving target and
I haven't always done it well.

47
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:54,083
You guys, for the hardest core
of you, you guys have heard me

48
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,625
say like I regret the first
five years of my marriage.

49
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,000
We should've went, I wish I had

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
those memories of those
seven to 10 vacations. You know?

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,875
But it helped me do a
better job with the kids.

52
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,000
You know?
I don't have those regrets.

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,208
I'm pumped that I started my day
today at 10 and watched

54
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,000
Misha and Xander's assembly.

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,166
You know something that I don't
know if I would've done 12 years

56
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:17,375
ago, so it's a moving target and
the truth is for anybody that's

57
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:20,208
struggling with it or thinking
about it, it just only works the

58
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:25,250
way everything works which
is constant communication.

59
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,083
What Lizzie cares about is
different today than what she

60
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,625
cared about yesterday
let alone two years ago.

61
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,583
- [Man 3] First off,
thanks for having us here.

62
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,250
Appreciate it.

63
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,208
- [Gary] No worries.
- So what's your thought--

64
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:42,542
- It was funny, when I did
that offer I was like what's the

65
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:44,750
best, (stammering)

66
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,333
did anybody do the same
thing with Thank You Economy?

67
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,792
Was anybody around
for all of that?

68
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:52,125
So with Thank You Economy I did
a similar thing like buy this

69
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:55,125
thing and something's gonna
happen, buy the books and

70
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,750
we sent a thank you box.

71
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,834
Right, we just sent the book
but was like $100 with the shit

72
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:01,208
which was like more
than the books cost.

73
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,959
I was like proud you
know like that was good.

74
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,250
They've got more stuff but
I was like what's, you know,

75
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,291
the number one asset is access.

76
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,041
People are willing to fly from
fucking Australia, you know?

77
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,208
Alaska.

78
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,250
- [Woman] I actually
said to my husband--

79
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,458
- You must've so pissed right?

80
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,667
I've said Georgia and she's
like, "Australia" and she's like

81
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:22,375
"Fuck."

82
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:26,125
(group laughter)

83
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,000
That's awesome.

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,625
- [Alex] There's somebody coming
from Ireland who's not here yet.

85
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,458
- [Gary] Wow.

86
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,250
- [Alex] They're literally
coming from the airport.

87
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,500
- Amazing.

88
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,083
Yeah, brother.

89
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:38,875
- Question was can you break
down your thought process

90
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,166
when you enter a room?

91
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,291
How do you break
down the situation?

92
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,625
How do you analyze, how do you
choose what actually pertains?

93
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,125
- That's interesting.

94
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,458
I come in blank.

95
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,041
It's why I like Q&amp;A.

96
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:55,834
I come in blank
and super confident.

97
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:57,667
And I stay to my shit.

98
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:00,792
Boy, will I not reach.

99
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:03,708
You know this is a really
interesting transformation even

100
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,667
for me the last year because
obviously my profile is much

101
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:10,625
stronger than it was a year ago
today and I've been around for a

102
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,834
decade digitally so I've been
like, I've been noticed and in

103
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:18,583
the game since 2006 but
between the contents...

104
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:22,792
It's so funny when everybody,
anybody razzes me on social like

105
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:25,750
especially Instagram where my
strategy has been very quote

106
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,708
driven and very rah-rah the most
version of myself there because

107
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,708
it's just the medium that
I think it's right for, right?

108
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,542
So there more than anywhere
else because fucking Facebook is

109
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:38,208
really detailed with the show
and other things, there I'll get

110
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,583
the occasional like, "All right,
I get it hustle like

111
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,083
"fucking give me a detail."

112
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,708
And I always get so pissed at
that person because I'm like,

113
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,458
"You're such a fucking idiot.

114
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,875
"I'm giving you
details every day.

115
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:54,000
"Watch me, don't listen to me.

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,667
"Do what I'm doing.

117
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:59,583
"It will work,
it works every time."

118
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:03,959
So you know, I don't even
know why I went there but

119
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:06,834
the punchline is
I stay in my lane.

120
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:10,375
I know what I'm talking about,
about what I'm talking about

121
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,708
and so what I'm pretty
good at actually is forcing

122
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,542
the room to go in my direction.

123
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:19,625
If I walked into a room and the
conversation was gonna be about

124
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:23,417
SEO because they're like, "Hey,
I hear Vayner's doing everything

125
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:25,083
"and we really want
talk about SEO."

126
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:29,792
I'll energy-wise push them into
Facebook and social, you know?

127
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:32,583
It's what I want to talk about.

128
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:36,625
So I keep it on my turf and then

129
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,583
so yeah I actually think
I can break this down.

130
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:43,250
I keep it on my turf but then
everything else is about them.

131
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,917
That's the non-debatable.

132
00:05:44,917 --> 00:05:46,875
It's gonna be on my turf.

133
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,542
Now, tell me what you want.

134
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:50,500
Even this.

135
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,708
There was no
debate of the format.

136
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,375
There was no like how do
you guys want to do this.

137
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,834
This is what we're gonna do,
now everything else about you.

138
00:05:57,834 --> 00:05:59,000
Got it?

139
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,792
- [Man 3] Do you ever
have to go on defense?

140
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:02,583
Or you just have the
ball in your court?

141
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,917
- I'm never on defense.

142
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:05,792
I'll bail, I'll bail.

143
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:10,000
When I when I was dating, if I
saw anything that wasn't in,

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,250
if I dated so
I hated negativity.

145
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,458
It's why we have
a great culture.

146
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,000
If I dated a girl that
I realized very quickly like

147
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
she liked, it was intriguing
to have conflict,

148
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,083
I literally bailed immediately.

149
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,959
Out forever.

150
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,542
I have no effort for defense.

151
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:31,083
I'm trying to win every
game 477 to 433 and

152
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,125
I'm talking about baseball.

153
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,041
You know what I mean?

154
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,500
- [Man 4] I don't watch baseball
but yeah.

155
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,375
- But you know what you mean?

156
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,500
But baseball where
there's lower scoring.

157
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,333
That's why that's the analogy.

158
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,458
Fucking soccer.

159
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:45,125
I'm trying to score
so many points

160
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,750
that I'm not worried
about the casualties.

161
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,667
You know this more because
you've been at Vayner like

162
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:52,041
I never care about the
failures at Vayner.

163
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,542
I love when people come
in to me and be like,

164
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:55,291
"Listen I've got to talk to
you about this problem.

165
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,542
"It's really gonna
undermine us."

166
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,417
I'm like, "Are you
a fucking idiot?

167
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:01,166
"How the fuck you
think we got here?

168
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,291
"If you want me to
play your micro game,

169
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,250
"I'm gonna look
like everybody else."

170
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,000
So I'm always on the offense,

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,166
always macro and always very
aware of what I want to happen.

172
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,583
- [Man 5] So with that you're
running a old school business

173
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,917
model and scaling it.

174
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:17,625
- [Gary] Because I--

175
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,500
- [Man 5] This is an old
school business model.

176
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,041
- 100%.
- [Man 5] Old school,

177
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,500
like not new school with
new school technologies.

178
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,083
- Every internet friend I had
texted me that I was a fucking

179
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,792
idiot for starting VaynerMedia.

180
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:29,458
- [Man 5] And this move
is an old school move and

181
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:33,875
it's a huge risk.
- What's a risk?

182
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,583
- [Man 5] Taking on a building
and the amount of people.

183
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,667
How are you
scaling the unscalable?

184
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,500
- By wrecking--

185
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,542
- [Man 5] This is unscalable
to everyone's imagination.

186
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:46,708
- Right.Because I recognize
that that's my strength.

187
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,792
My strength is people.

188
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,291
My strength is marketing.

189
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,125
- How do you teach this
young crowd old school?

190
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,166
Because most of them don't look
like they got out of college.

191
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:00,083
- You'd be stunned how many of
the young kids have old school

192
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,000
tactics and beliefs and how many

193
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,375
of the old school have
young school tactics.

194
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,458
It's not an age thing,
it's a DNA thing.

195
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,583
- Ah, so you're
hiring DNA that way.

196
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:10,417
- We're trying.
- Some.

197
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:12,083
- By the way, no, no,

198
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,417
we're firing people that
don't have the DNA.

199
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,250
- I get it.
That's smart.

200
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,917
- People are crippled by heart,
I mean look you up insight.

201
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:20,041
Throw it in here.
You've been around.

202
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,583
- [Woman 2] I've been at a lot
of different ad agencies

203
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,500
and this is by far

204
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,083
the most amazing place
I've worked at.

205
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,875
- Because, of course
it's true because

206
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,375
I fire all the bad people.
(group laughter)

207
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,250
And by the way,
if you're here for a week

208
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,750
and you're in that moment,

209
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,250
you know somebody can
hide you for even a year.

210
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,000
We're at scale.

211
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,792
They may be able to, you know,
kind of get away with it for a

212
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:43,250
little while but not for real.

213
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,041
You know I mean?

214
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,166
And a year is
probably impossible.

215
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,166
Six months, yes.

216
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,708
So the answer is 'cause
that's what I'm good at.

217
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,625
You know that was the punchline,
let me build like do you know

218
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:58,000
how impossible this
company is to beat.

219
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,291
I got the craziest
email from a recruiter.

220
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,500
Like the craziest which was,
"I've been trying to recruit

221
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,208
"from your company, we were
put on assignment to steal your

222
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:11,625
"people by a competitor,
we got zero."

223
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,792
He's like, "We've
never seen this before.

224
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:15,333
"Can we work with you?"

225
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,458
So I just thought I could do it.

226
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,834
It's really no different than
like you know like being the

227
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:25,000
best basketball player or singer

228
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,458
like I don't know that
sounds hard. You know?

229
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:33,250
So scalability doesn't scare
me because people have scaled

230
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,333
people for many years, we're
just in the tech age where it

231
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,000
doesn't seem as cool.
You know?

232
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,667
- [Man 6] You're
winning here so...

233
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,417
- Hell yeah.

234
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:45,792
- [Woman] Just on that growth thing,
I don't know how big or

235
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:47,750
small our businesses are
but going from that kind of

236
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,667
lifestyle where your business is

237
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:53,333
creating cash and
you've got small team

238
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:57,125
to going to a much larger
performance business where

239
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,291
potentially there's a bit in
the middle where it's desert.

240
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,708
Cash flow dries up
and profit goes down.

241
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,500
- [Gary] Yes.

242
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,291
- I've got a great
lifestyle business that

243
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,917
generates a stack of cash.
- [Gary] Yep.

244
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:10,250
- And I want to performance
business but I know there's this

245
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,542
hideous desert in the middle and
I'm gonna get through that as

246
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:13,417
quickly as possible.

247
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:14,458
You've done that a
couple of times.

248
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,166
- [Gary] Yes, I have.
- What would--

249
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,917
- [Gary] What's the punchline?
- Yep.

250
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:21,000
Other than all the stuff
that I know you already say.

251
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,625
- The punchline is all the stuff

252
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,834
that you know that
I already say.

253
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:24,583
(group laughter)

254
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,583
Which is those three years
are not just gonna be as fun.

255
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,750
- [Woman] Yeah and do it fast.

256
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,041
- But also respect that
it might take some time.

257
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,375
- [Woman] No different--
- You're such a young woman.

258
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,959
What's wrong with
too, yeah that's fine.

259
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,959
You're such a young woman like

260
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,708
what's wrong with
two years in between?

261
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,000
- [Woman] Nothing.
- By the way, that's it.

262
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
- [Woman] Yeah, okay.

263
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,125
- We're gonna make less money
this year at $100 million than

264
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:51,458
we made last year at $67.

265
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,417
Net.

266
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:53,834
I don't mean percentage.

267
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:55,792
Net.

268
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:59,125
- [Man 5] Why?
- Because I'm getting greedier.

269
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,208
Meaning they're in trouble.

270
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,083
Them.
(group laughter)

271
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,250
I see it which means
I over-invested.

272
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,583
More people,

273
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,041
more capabilities

274
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,000
because I'm gonna take
the whole fucking pie.

275
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,166
You know what I mean?

276
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:20,291
I'm not worried about how much
cash I'm gonna take home in 2016

277
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,834
because I can take
a lot more in 2020.

278
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:26,417
It's much more fun to take
home $44 million in 2020

279
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:30,417
than $3 million in
2017, '18 and '19.

280
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:32,500
Instead of $4 million.

281
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,708
People are, 99% of the
market is short term.

282
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:40,708
And the 1% that isn't and has
the talent wins every time.

283
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,583
Which makes no sense because
unless you're gonna die

284
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,875
you should only play long term.

285
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:50,792
There was a stat that some dude
in Mexico City said one of these

286
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:52,166
futurist type characters,
I'm sure he's smart.

287
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,959
I have no idea who so I just but

288
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:56,500
he was right before me as
I was mic'd up and he says,

289
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,458
"It's been
scientifically proven,"

290
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,792
so I don't know if it has or not
because I've learned to take

291
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:02,500
that with a grain of salt but

292
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,834
"that 85% of what

293
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:08,417
"humans make
decisions about is irrational."

294
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:09,625
And that spoke to me.

295
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,041
Because A,
I think it's higher

296
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:16,166
and B, it's why I think all
my success is happening.

297
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:20,208
I am stunningly the most
rational and the most practical

298
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:23,792
of all yet I don't seem it.

299
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:27,208
And when he said it I'm like,
"Right, that's why."

300
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,291
"Because the rest of the
market is irrational."

301
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:35,708
- [Man 7] I always
find it intriguing

302
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:39,125
of how people share their
story about discovering you.

303
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,667
My friend was
interviewed by Marie Forleo.

304
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,458
and you were the
next video on the cue

305
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,500
being interviewed
when Jeb came out,

306
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,166
so I was, all right,
who the hell is this?

307
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,708
That's it,
I was a follower then.

308
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,083
Do you still take that mentality

309
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,417
of being everywhere?
- Yes, never too fancy.

310
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:54,792
- [Man 7] Like eight
view podcast or whatever

311
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,250
when there's
not a book involved?

312
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,583
- Yes.
- [Man 7] Okay.

313
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,166
Because the
potential of being in front

314
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,792
of everyone that doesn't
even know who you are

315
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:04,625
is like, just crazy.

316
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,000
- It is crazy.

317
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,959
Or is it?

318
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:09,667
(group laughter)

319
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:10,625
- [Man 7] There's
plenty of people opening up

320
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,083
fast food things with two
million YouTube followers,

321
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,208
I think we could bump your
number up a little bit.

322
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,291
- You know what's funny,

323
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,291
I think you know
this at this point,

324
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,458
I really mean that
I don't give a fuck.

325
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,542
Three hundred thirty thousand?

326
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:27,083
Mazel tov.
And?

327
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,375
- [Man 7] And they're
the most loyal followers too.

328
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,458
- And if not?

329
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,125
I'm gonna make
more money than PewDiePie.

330
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:39,333
(group laughter)

331
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,834
- Honey, empire.

332
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,834
Honey, empire.

333
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:46,667
They both matter.

334
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:49,542
- [Man 8] And how
do you maintain that?

335
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:53,041
- By making all my
actions honey and empire.

336
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,834
And then letting the people
that are capable stay

337
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,792
and letting the people
that are not capable

338
00:13:57,792 --> 00:14:00,667
either choose or
be forced to leave.

339
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:03,000
- [Man 8] So empower
them with that decision?

340
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,500
- Binary.

341
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,250
Hang on here
because I want you to get it.

342
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,500
Through my actions.

343
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,208
That's it.

344
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,166
I sent an email to
140 employees this week

345
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,250
asking for who the
strongest and the weakest

346
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,000
employee was
that they work with.

347
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,333
It sent garbage
through our company.

348
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,166
People emailing
that we've changed.

349
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,250
People emailing,

350
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,041
websites to post it.

351
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:32,834
Fear.

352
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:39,000
Gave me an indication on
who's scared, who's not.

353
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,458
Who understands, who doesn't.

354
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:45,333
Everybody boxes everything
in and creates context,

355
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,250
which means they
then lose context.

356
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,333
The reason I scale so well
is every behavior I do

357
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,041
is predicated on
creating the most context

358
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,166
from the reaction to my action.

359
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,792
Yeah it's like, I don't
even know what that means,

360
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:06,375
but probably.
(group laughter)

361
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:10,708
I'm being dead serious,
I really don't.

362
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:11,583
But you know what I mean?

363
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:12,875
Even an indicator of like,

364
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,708
it's interesting,
the people I don't know,

365
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,625
the people I do know,
why they're here,

366
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,542
it's all context building.

367
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,041
I'm obsessed with context.

368
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,125
I'm the greatest listener
you've ever met

369
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,750
it's just that I talk so
much nobody realized it.

370
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:32,250
- So you say, which
I'm trying to recalibrate

371
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,083
my brain around to,
you love losing?

372
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,959
- [Gary] Love it.

373
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:37,333
You know why?
- No.

374
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,708
- [Gary] Because I don't
care how anybody

375
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,625
judges my losses.

376
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,542
You only care
about losing because

377
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:44,500
you care about what other
people think about your loss.

378
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,375
- [Man 9] And so
on that note,

379
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,834
because I saw you at Traffic
Conversion Show in San Diego.

380
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:51,959
- [Gary] Yes,
that was a good one.

381
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,166
- It was, it was the
first time I saw you.

382
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,708
- [Gary] Did you know
who I was before?

383
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:56,417
- Sorry?

384
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:58,208
- [Gary] Did you know who
I was before I took the stage?

385
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,041
- No, no.

386
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,458
- [Gary] That's the best!

387
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,166
- And so immediately my
wife and I were driving home

388
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,500
from San Diego to
Orange County and we started

389
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,583
figuring out that
you had a podcast.

390
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,750
And so I went back in
time to the first one

391
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,333
all the way up to
the ones you have now,

392
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,625
like 200 something.

393
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,417
- [Gary] I appreciate it.

394
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:17,375
So what did you
take away from it?

395
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,750
Like in that kind of a binge,

396
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,625
coming from zero context,
what was like the...

397
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,834
- The biggest thing...

398
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:24,708
- [Gary] The greatest
human ever?

399
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:25,750
(group laughter)
- That was one of them.

400
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,166
I have no idols
myself but you were one

401
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,583
that I would say
is like the closest,

402
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,417
because you were doing
exactly what I would do.

403
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:33,208
And I have a mini, mini agency,

404
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:37,041
I'm not anywhere close to
anything of what you're doing.

405
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,000
- [Gary] And you know
what so crazy about that?

406
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,708
Even the way you hedge
it, it means nothing.

407
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,125
Right?

408
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,792
Like, I love, I'm always
fascinated by what,

409
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:45,083
I appreciate the humility.

410
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,000
It's so interesting that
we do that as humans.

411
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,458
Like even
context shit like that.

412
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,792
Keep going.

413
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:53,417
- [Man 9] I almost
lost my train of thought.

414
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:55,917
- [Gary] I already
lost it once today.

415
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:58,583
- One of the biggest
takeaways that you mention,

416
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,792
and this is not even a question

417
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:01,000
I just want to say thank you,

418
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,417
is the net/net thing,

419
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:04,290
of like all the
small things you lose

420
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,665
but in the big picture.

421
00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:08,999
Like 99% of the
things don't matter.

422
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,040
- [Gary] Dude, I swear
on the New York Jets,

423
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,875
which I've never lied
on in my entire life,

424
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:18,750
I genuinely only care about
the health of my family.

425
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,208
It's so crazy you couldn't
even wrap your head around it.

426
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,165
Do you know how
many copies of a book

427
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:27,583
of how VaynerMedia went
from a hundred million

428
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,333
to going out of
business I could sell?

429
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,417
All of them.

430
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:34,583
It's a no lose game for me.

431
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,500
It's not scary.

432
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,792
- [Man 10] One of
the recent DailyVee's

433
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:45,959
you mention that it's like
the hockey stick curve,

434
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:49,875
the last six months, what
was it 500K subscribers.

435
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:50,834
- [Gary] Oh Facebook.

436
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:52,834
- [Man 10] Yeah,
your team, where you

437
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:55,708
analyze the metrics
and the analytics.

438
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,417
I know your context
has been insane lately.

439
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:01,708
- It's the five or six
videos that go ballistic

440
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,333
that change the outcome.

441
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,875
The fucking intern
video went insane-o.

442
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,708
It's so crazy,
it's actually two new demos

443
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,750
for me on some level.

444
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:14,667
You can tell Danny if
he wants to hang he can.

445
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,959
The urban market,
because the Breakfast Club.

446
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,917
Right, hip hop,
African American, Latino,

447
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:22,417
just hip hop heads,
like sneaker heads.

448
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:24,125
Breakfast Club went viral,
those clips

449
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,458
with Cha The God, right viral.

450
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,917
So a lot more urban.

451
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:31,458
And the intern video,
and much younger.

452
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,166
That's it!

453
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:35,125
Two huge new demos
that a video that got

454
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:38,333
20, 30 million reach
on Facebook created.

455
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,417
Facebook's television guys.

456
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:46,375
You're one video away
from changing your life.

457
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,500
People just don't believe it.

458
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,250
People are also not
willing to make a video

459
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,125
everyday always constantly.

460
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:57,208
And most importantly,
and this is just straight up,

461
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,959
most people aren't
capable of producing

462
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:00,834
content everyday
that's interesting,

463
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:03,875
good, thoughtful,
entertaining, fascinating,

464
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,583
pretty, like it's hard.

465
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,625
I think I said it today,
did I say it today?

466
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,792
Did I say it today on social?
Talent or I made a video...

467
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:15,583
DRock, help me.
(audience laughs)

468
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,208
Where did I do that?

469
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,041
Talent is (stammers)

470
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,375
Oh, the interview!
- [DRock] Yeah.

471
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,083
(clicks tongue)

472
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,500
Talent, guys talent.

473
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,792
Talent's real,
it's a real thing.

474
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:31,458
- [Man 11] Which
platform has

475
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,542
your most responsive audience?

476
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:35,708
If you ask a yes or no question

477
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,750
who responds the
most and the fastest?

478
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,542
- I think the attention
is deepest on Snapchat.

479
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:44,041
I really do, by like percentage.

480
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,417
You know Facebook...

481
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,750
You know what's so funny?

482
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,291
Back to the analytics,

483
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,083
I'm in the branding business

484
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,458
and all of you guys are
in the sales business.

485
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,875
And once you understand
what I mean by that

486
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,834
that's where the
whole thing unlocks.

487
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:57,875
Everybody's into the sales.

488
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,583
What I mean by that is,

489
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,500
everybody's trying
to look at the tactics.

490
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,750
I'm in the religion.

491
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,250
The reason I don't know is

492
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,625
because I'm playing forever
and I'm building brand.

493
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,500
It just doesn't matter.

494
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,625
- [Man 12] You
talked about that...

495
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,208
- By the way,
I'll give you a go in a sec,

496
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,375
if that was the way
the game was played

497
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,708
everybody's looking
at the metrics.

498
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,083
If this was math
it would've been

499
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,542
figured out a long time ago,

500
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:23,708
you need to let that go.

501
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:27,000
Math gets you rich.

502
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,625
You can figure out a conversion,

503
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,500
a landing page optimization,

504
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,458
a moment in time.

505
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:37,000
Math doesn't
get you what I want.

506
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,834
- [Man 13] So when
we coach we talk about,

507
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:40,959
gotta have perspectives
to see kind of what

508
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:42,333
the athletes doing.

509
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,375
They're gonna have their
vision coaching wise.

510
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,792
You've got to have attention.

511
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:47,625
If you can't get them
to pay attention to you,

512
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,625
you're screwed.
- Yeah.

513
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,500
- The next thing is direction.

514
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,417
You have perspective talent,

515
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,375
you have the ability
to see things that

516
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,708
probably a lot of us miss.

517
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,250
We get that.

518
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,083
You definitely have our
attention though,

519
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,542
now we're looking at you

520
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:03,125
saying we want to mirror it.

521
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,333
We might not be able to
keep it the same pace

522
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,959
- [Gary] A version
of it for myself.

523
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:06,834
I push that hard.

524
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:07,667
I want to make
sure that everybody

525
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,333
gets their version of it,
around what they want.

526
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,458
I hate when kids are like

527
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,375
"I want to buy
the Cavaliers now!"

528
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,750
I'm like did you before?

529
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,417
(laughter)

530
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:17,708
- They're missing
the point though.

531
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,792
- [Gary] They're
missing the point.

532
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:19,708
- Yeah the people
that are talking...

533
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:20,583
- [Gary] That's right.

534
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,375
- So you have
our attention and that's

535
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,166
probably got them too.

536
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,000
- [Gary] Yes.

537
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,500
- What's the direction now?

538
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,250
What's the next move?

539
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,166
Because you're pushing it-

540
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,708
- [Gary] From me or
through you guys to you?

541
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:32,583
- Through us.

542
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,125
- [Gary] Self awareness.

543
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,208
- Can't give that.

544
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,041
- [Gary] No?

545
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:36,959
- [Man 12] Can't
give that though.

546
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:39,291
- Yeah. Well I don't want
to give you anything else.

547
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,792
You know what I mean?

548
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:42,041
I just...

549
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,166
You have to understand.

550
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,125
Advice is a shit business.

551
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,291
Because you lack context.

552
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,291
I mean do you know how much
context to give you real advice

553
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,333
I would need?

554
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,667
In this setting?

555
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,959
Is your dad sick?

556
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:02,041
Did your mom leave your dad?

557
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,458
Do you have a sibling
that's fucking crushing it

558
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,875
and always did?

559
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,000
Do you have,
there's so much context

560
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,125
I actually need
to give the direction

561
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,750
that I would feel good about,

562
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,000
that'd I'd rather in a world
where everybody's selling

563
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,250
"tactics" and "advice"
and "direction"

564
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,291
I'm going to be
an ungodly force of nature

565
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:25,417
against leveling up the
thinking at every moment.

566
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:28,500
And then through my actions,

567
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,000
hoping that you guys pick up
on them and replicate them.

568
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,834
- [Man 12] And then answering

569
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:33,458
the other question
that I propose.

570
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:36,625
Schedule wise for business
what's the direction now?

571
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,917
If you push us to buy a
book, we're gonna buy a book.

572
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:39,458
- [Gary] Yes.

573
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,458
- You've got our attention.
- [Gary] Yes.

574
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:43,500
- You say hey buy the product,
small business VanynerMedia

575
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,166
we'll buy it right now.

576
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:47,750
- [Gary] I don't want
you guys, not yet.

577
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,708
- Because we're new compared
to the other people.

578
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,500
(laughter)
- [Gary] No!

579
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,417
Dude think about this,
you know this.

580
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:54,583
There's more money in it
for me to go after you than

581
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:55,417
the other...

582
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:56,875
- [Man 12] The
volumes there.

583
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:57,708
- Are you kidding?

584
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:58,542
- [Man 12] But you
haven't done it.

585
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:00,417
You do it once ever two
years on a book for 12 bucks.

586
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:01,583
- Right.

587
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,375
I just don't need it right now.

588
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,458
And I say right now,
I mean I've contemplated.

589
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:07,375
I want to.

590
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:10,708
I want to create a
VaynerMedia SaaS product

591
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:13,542
that's $5000 a month,
that helps you.

592
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:15,000
I just don't have it yet.

593
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,792
I can't take your
$60,000 if I don't have it.

594
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:19,542
But if I have it,
I'll give it to you.

595
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:20,834
Because you'll win.

596
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:21,875
So VaynerTALENT,

597
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:24,583
that you might have
saw in the last episode,

598
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:25,959
that's going to be
a huge department.

599
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:27,166
Everybody wants to be me.

600
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,542
There's people in here
that actually would

601
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:30,667
pay $25,000 for me to do it.

602
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:32,708
They feel like they
can make the math work.

603
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:35,208
To have their
DRock and my machine.

604
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,750
Here's the punchline...

605
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,458
It will work.

606
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,500
So that's cool.

607
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,208
So I feel good about,

608
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:42,041
that'd be the first time
I enter into slightly

609
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:45,041
that territory, truth is
I'm gonna hold it off.

610
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,625
'Cause I still
don't want to go there.

611
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,500
I'll do it with you know...

612
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,166
Tyra Banks.
You know?

613
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:53,542
But if I can get there I would.

614
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:55,834
I only sell what I'm proud of.

615
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:00,291
I'm obsessed with selling stuff.

616
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:01,917
Like stuff.

617
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:04,166
This Amazon arbitrage is real.

618
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,667
This eBay arbitrage is real.

619
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:09,625
Like I don't know how
much money she needs,

620
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:12,125
but I can tell you it is scary.

621
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,500
Scary.

622
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,208
If she's willing to study
eBay three hours a night

623
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,250
for three months, then
I think she can make

624
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,000
$100,000 a year going to
thrift stores and garage sales.

625
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,875
That's cool.

626
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,041
Easy.

627
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:25,750
Easy.

628
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,959
Easier than anybody would know.

629
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:30,708
- [Man 13] He did it last
week on SnapChat with-

630
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:32,208
- You know like it's...

631
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:34,000
And by the way books.

632
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,750
Books.

633
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,000
On Amazon.

634
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:39,417
There's that dude
whose a fan of mine

635
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:41,583
who claims he's making $600,000,

636
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,125
he's probably hit your
radar maybe here or there.

637
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:44,041
Like I don't know he's some guy,

638
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:46,250
if you see on YouTube he
gets paid like $600,000

639
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,000
selling books last year.

640
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
He went all in.

641
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,291
He just goes
to every thrift store,

642
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:50,417
takes his fucking phone out,

643
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:51,834
scans every fucking book.

644
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:53,917
Sees the velocities,
so it means they'll sell,

645
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:55,792
because you don't want to
get caught with inventory.

646
00:24:55,792 --> 00:24:57,792
Has feel for if
it will actually sell

647
00:24:57,792 --> 00:25:00,417
and then he sees it
sells for $23 on average

648
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:03,917
and it's a dollar at the
fucking Goodwill and he buys it.

649
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:05,041
And he did that scale.

650
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:08,458
Because if you work 18
hours, some people can't.

651
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:09,875
Like I get it.

652
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,458
Which is why I don't judge.

653
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:15,917
I walked to Kmart to buy
shit for $4 with my mom.

654
00:25:15,917 --> 00:25:18,166
Like, I've got context.

655
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:19,375
I know.

656
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:21,333
And guess what
I don't even really know,

657
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:24,208
because both my parents lost
a parent before they were 15.

658
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:27,750
Like I've had it good,
for my humble beginnings.

659
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,667
Who am I?

660
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:29,959
I'm not judging anybody.

661
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:33,792
But I'm not going to make it
convenient for you either.

662
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:35,083
That's what I believe.

663
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,458
Because I know
who buys that shit.

664
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:38,333
Do you understand?

665
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,166
- [Woman 4] Yeah.

666
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:41,917
- And that fucking hurts me too.

667
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:44,500
I'm just not gonna pick
you over the other person.

668
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,583
I'm just not.

669
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:46,834
So, by the way,

670
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:49,792
people can say
anything they want,

671
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:50,667
and do anything they want

672
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:51,583
and they should.

673
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,500
But that is my truth.

674
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,583
And you're right you don't need

675
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:56,208
to be the player
to be the coach,

676
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:59,208
that's only one of the 40
things that sit on my head.

677
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:00,708
- [Man 14] Yeah I agree
with you, yeah.

678
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,000
I mean you've got to be well

679
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,667
100% believe in
what you're selling.

680
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:07,667
- But I have the luxury
to believe in what I sell.

681
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:10,583
Like I said, I would steal food
faster than you could blink.

682
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:11,792
If I had to.

683
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:13,959
For my kids, if I had no money.

684
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:16,667
And I would,
I swear to God I would.

685
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:17,708
Steal.

686
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:19,417
I didn't say go in the
garbage and take food,

687
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:21,542
I would do that too.

688
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:23,583
But steal too.

689
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:24,458
Life is life.

690
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,417
- Question on e-Commerce.
Can we talk e-Commerce?

691
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:29,333
- Of course, I'm willing to,
we can talk about anything.

692
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:30,583
- Listen to my podcast because
that's all I talk about

693
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:33,875
is e-Commerce, Amazon and
eBay and all that jazz right.

694
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:36,750
So I get people reaching
out to me all the time with

695
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:40,208
these new venues trying to sell.

696
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:41,125
- Yes.

697
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:42,875
- How do you figure
out which one has legs?

698
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:45,166
You know all these new
platforms coming out,

699
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:47,583
Amazon is you know that big.

700
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:49,583
Then eBay and Etsy and
all the rest of them.

701
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:50,708
But there's other
ones coming out.

702
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,250
How do you figure out
which one has legs?

703
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,125
- I just do them all.

704
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,500
- Because we
- I do them all.

705
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,333
- Invest
- I get it.

706
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:58,208
- So much energy and effort
to bring a product to market

707
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:00,417
in those marketplaces.
- Of course.

708
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:01,875
That's the punchline.
- That's the hard part.

709
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:04,041
- Think about how lucky you,
think about how lucky you,

710
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:04,875
no no lets play it out.

711
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:06,166
I know you know,
but let's play it out

712
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,917
because I want
everybody to hear this.

713
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,083
Think about how lucky we have it

714
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,291
that we're doing it digital.

715
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:11,959
Because the real estate
version of this is

716
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:15,041
which beach front property
do you think is gonna work.

717
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:16,750
But if I told you if you
had enough money

718
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,041
if you bet on 10 of 'em,
all you need of one of 'em

719
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:21,583
and you'll make your
money back and then some.

720
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:22,583
- So put it on all 10?

721
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:23,500
- But you know what?

722
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,542
I know that Peach and I know
that Anchor are out there.

723
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:28,792
And you guys have seen me.

724
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:31,083
I'll say something about Anchor,
I'll taste it for a second.

725
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:31,917
I haven't done
anything on Anchor

726
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:34,917
for fucking nine months, right.

727
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:37,417
Figure out a version
where you put in the work

728
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:40,083
to actually taste it

729
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:42,208
but you don't go so
over-committed.

730
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,750
Got it.

731
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,834
You gotta find
that right balance.

732
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:45,375
- A little bit of risk.

733
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:48,625
- It's about risk.

734
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,542
Do you know what
my number one asset is?

735
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:52,542
- Let me think.

736
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:55,208
Yeah, I think, well you already,

737
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:56,542
- My asset--
- Well you don't give a shit.

738
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,708
- No, my number one asset,
not my number one skill.

739
00:27:58,708 --> 00:27:59,458
What?

740
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:00,375
- [Man] You know yourself.
- [Woman] Time.

741
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:01,959
- Time.

742
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:02,917
Time.

743
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:04,208
Time is my asset.

744
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:05,125
Right.

745
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:06,583
It's time.

746
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:07,750
And then I do all this stuff

747
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,125
on these platforms on spec.

748
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:13,875
Got it?

749
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:16,375
- It's on, I get it.

750
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,750
- Do you know how much
easier it for me to write a

751
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:23,375
$50,000 check that I gave away
to the non-profit in Canada.

752
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:24,458
Right.

753
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:26,875
I got so many e-mails about
that, I'm such a great guy.

754
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:28,000
No I'm not.

755
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,208
That's the easiest
non-profit work I do.

756
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,417
That fucking three hour
fucking meeting I have to do,

757
00:28:32,417 --> 00:28:34,708
with Pencils of Promise each
month, that fucking blows.

758
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:37,041
(group laughter)

759
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:40,583
Time.

760
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:42,375
- [Man 15] What's the
most exciting thing

761
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:44,208
in your life right now?

762
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:47,333
Couple things that you
think about every day?

763
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:50,458
- That Misha is 100% got a shot

764
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:53,000
to have a bigger audience
than me in about two years.

765
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,834
(group laughter)

766
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:56,625
'Cause she's gonna be the
nine-year-old girl version of
me,

767
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:59,667
deployed against singing
and entertainment.

768
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:01,875
I'm really in a good
zone right now bro,

769
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:03,708
like the most exciting
thing is, I've gotten

770
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:06,125
to a really tight
zone around health,

771
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:09,000
family and business,
and it's tight.

772
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,375
- [Man 15] (mumbles)

773
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,542
- Yeah, it's goin' right.
(everyone laughing)

774
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:14,333
You know, like really tight,
you know?

775
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:15,750
Real tight.

776
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,667
More family time than ever,
working harder

777
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:23,208
and stronger than ever,
and feeling better than ever.

778
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:26,667
So, it's gonna play itself out.

779
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:28,667
And don't forget,
Lizzy married me.

780
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:30,625
So it's not like she's foreign
to it, or scared of it,

781
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:31,834
you know what I mean?

782
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:34,625
So, Lizzy's super
capable with that.

783
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,208
Now, the difference is,

784
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:40,083
supporting, at the time, a
30-year-old male's version

785
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:42,208
into that game versus
a nine-year-old girl's

786
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:44,291
version is very different.

787
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:46,041
So, different dynamics, right?

788
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:48,083
Like, you're gettin'
the theme of this talk,

789
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:49,083
from me at least, is like,

790
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:52,417
it's just so many details,
you know?

791
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:55,375
Like, there'll be a
million variables there.

792
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:58,667
Like, most of Misha's
friends are on Musically,

793
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:01,917
and she's not, I mean, that's
the irony of it all, isn't it?

794
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:02,875
- Why is she not?

795
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:03,708
Do you know why?
- 'Cause Lizzy

796
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:05,000
doesn't want her on there.
- Okay.

797
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,375
- [Man 15] And that's
what I deal with the kids,

798
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:09,333
I deal with the dynamic
between the parent,

799
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:11,458
not allowing it, and the
frustration between the kid

800
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:15,000
having social dynamic
differences because of it.

801
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,083
It changes.

802
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,583
- There's real stuff out there.

803
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,917
But there always has been.

804
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:20,917
Do you know how scared I was

805
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:22,917
that Russia was
gonna drop a nuclear bomb

806
00:30:22,917 --> 00:30:25,041
on America when
I was in third grade?

807
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:26,917
I thought about it
every day of my life.

808
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:28,166
I swear to God.

809
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:33,000
There's always
somethin' to be scared of.

810
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,458
I'm just not scared 'cause
I'm just the most practical.

811
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:41,000
More people will die
in America this year

812
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,667
by being struck by
lightning than terrorism.

813
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:48,917
I know it's true.

814
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:51,041
It's just data, not super hard.

815
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,625
It's not convenient or
interesting or

816
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:53,542
a fun thing to say,

817
00:30:53,542 --> 00:30:56,458
it's the truth.

818
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:57,708
- [Man 16] There's nothin'
you can do about it,

819
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:58,458
so why worry?

820
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:01,125
- It's not even that, it's
just like, but nobody,

821
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,750
like, I mean, there's
entire gen, there's fuckin',

822
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,667
hundred million people
walkin' around America

823
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:07,959
scared of terrorists,
like fearful, scared.

824
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:10,667
My mother-in-law
is scared shitless.

825
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:12,291
- [Woman] It's more
dangerous crossing a road.

826
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:14,208
- 'Specially the way
I do it, I don't even look!

827
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:18,667
- [Man 15] Your rationality
is pretty slim.

828
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:20,583
- [Man 16] DailyVee,
I think it was 80,

829
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:22,792
the live stream
goes out last week?

830
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:23,625
- [Gary] 80 the long one?

831
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:25,750
- Yeah, so, one of my
favorites, well the favorite,

832
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,875
well actually
Salty Vee was my favorite.

833
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:29,125
(group laughter)

834
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:31,291
Yeah, with the whole talk
at the end, I don't know

835
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:33,458
what that was all about.

836
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,291
There was a meeting
you were in, and I've

837
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:38,083
been thinking about it since,
and you got

838
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:40,542
on this little rant
with him about--

839
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:41,291
- [Gary] A hamster wheel?

840
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:42,917
- A hamster wheel, and
how you close the door

841
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:44,333
and go to Mars and
never come back--

842
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,125
- [Gary] And by the way like
the only, like, just real quick

843
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:47,208
'cause I don't know
if you caught it.

844
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:51,583
I said it before he said it,
because I just listen

845
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:53,125
to what people, you know?

846
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:53,959
It's so interesting.

847
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:54,792
Go ahead.

848
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:56,583
- Okay, you slam the
doors, you go to Mars,

849
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:59,667
you never come back, you
wish that on no one, ever.

850
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:00,834
- [Gary] 'Cause it's so scary.

851
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:02,250
- But, what I'm tryin'
to figure out was,

852
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,375
what did that mean?

853
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:05,875
- [Gary] What did that mean?
- What were you talking about?

854
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:10,041
- When you are so pot commit,
I care about capitalism,

855
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:12,375
and meritocracy, and the game,

856
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:14,834
more than I care about myself.

857
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:16,667
And that is crazy shit.

858
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:19,792
And I really don't see it,
and I, only 'cause I haven't

859
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:23,291
gotten close to it or figured
out how to see it in others,

860
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:25,583
but it is a different thing.

861
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:29,959
When you get to that
level of selflessness,

862
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:33,917
it's a vulnerability that
is so extreme, and it just,

863
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:37,959
it's so, I mean, I just
think I'm cut out for it,

864
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:41,542
and I don't wanna force
my audience into it,

865
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,125
because their behaviour
probably hasn't been

866
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:44,750
their whole life to be in it.

867
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,875
Got it?

868
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:47,041
- [Man 16] Yeah.

869
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:49,583
- Like it's crazy to be four
foot 11 your freshman year

870
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:51,208
of high school,
and still think you're

871
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:52,667
the best looking, most popular.

872
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:53,625
(group laughter)

873
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:57,458
Like, to be against the
market, is, my life is playing

874
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:59,083
against the market.

875
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,750
It's just, something
happened in the way that

876
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,417
the world works, that is
working very much in my favor.

877
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,250
But wouldn't have 30 years ago?

878
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,166
The market was
closed 30 years ago.

879
00:33:15,917 --> 00:33:18,458
- [Man 16] When you
were at Icon your talk, it,

880
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:20,375
huge breakthrough for me,
you already know

881
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,792
it's a breakthrough, you know
the stuff, you say it makes

882
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,583
a difference in people's
lives, but you were talkin'

883
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,250
about what you were
talkin' about earlier.

884
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,417
That, if you're in the
long game, you're not in it

885
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:29,083
for the short term, make a sale
right here,

886
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:30,000
but you're in it
for the long game.

887
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,583
- [Gary] Yeah that was an interesting

888
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:32,583
vibe I took at that conference,
'cause I knew there was

889
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:34,542
a lot of sales people.
- Yeah.

890
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:35,375
- [Gary] And I was coming

891
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:36,625
with marketing.
- Yeah.

892
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:37,750
- [Gary] Go ahead.

893
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,208
- It was right on for
where, for where I was at

894
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:44,041
in particular, because
I was in the middle

895
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:46,166
of capitalizing on
everything that I know,

896
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:48,500
and putting it in a way that
I could scale the things

897
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,834
that I'm best at, right?

898
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:52,250
Things that I'm good at,
and I kept thinking like,

899
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,542
I can't be here, I can't be
there, but if I'm in front

900
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:56,667
of people, that's when
I'm at my best.

901
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,792
And so when you started
talking about, look,

902
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:01,917
I'm not here for the short
thing, I wanna do a product,

903
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:03,917
like you said here, I wanna
do it, but I'm not ready

904
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,000
to do it yet because
I haven't figured it out yet.

905
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,833
And so this isn't so much more
of a question, other than,

906
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:10,833
I would just like to hear
you talk a little bit more

907
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:13,250
about whatever's on the
top of your brain right now

908
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,542
in regards to
your personal brand.

909
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:18,458
What you think about each
day when it comes to that,

910
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:22,333
and I dunno, however you've
evolved since that time,

911
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:23,417
'cause that was powerful.

912
00:34:23,417 --> 00:34:24,833
- It was always there.
- It changed the game.

913
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:26,333
- I've been able to start
articulating, you know,

914
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,291
it's really interesting,
even my early business talks,

915
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:30,208
if you've dug up some
of those things, like,

916
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:32,792
I wasn't so, like,
I wasn't there yet.

917
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:34,667
Like, I just, you know,
you learn from experience,

918
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:38,458
like, I mean, it's one move.

919
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:41,041
Where's the attention,
how do I create

920
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:44,000
for that medium,
deploy the message.

921
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:45,708
At scale.

922
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,542
One person scale.

923
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:51,500
Every day work, every day work.

924
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,792
You know?

925
00:34:52,792 --> 00:34:54,250
That's it man, it's really.

926
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,792
- [Man 16] Do you
think about that, or is it--

927
00:34:55,792 --> 00:34:59,208
- I think about that,
and nothing else.

928
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:01,583
And not my Facebook data.

929
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:03,333
And not my followers.

930
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:06,750
My self-esteem is not wrapped up

931
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,583
in my 604,000
Instagram followers.

932
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:15,375
'Cause there's some dude with
awesome abs that has 900,000.

933
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:16,708
(group laughter)

934
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:19,750
Like, that's just
not a smart game.

935
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,417
- [Man 16] So I really
honestly--

936
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:24,000
- I'm the most basic
thing you've ever seen.

937
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,750
- [Man 16] Your central
thought is, I'll just be me,

938
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,458
and I'll be damn
good at doin' it.

939
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:30,375
- Because I'm damn good
at business and marketing

940
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:33,333
and selling stuff, and all,
like, 'cause I'm good at that.

941
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:35,417
Again, I keep saying it,
and it's funny,

942
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:36,417
it's this whole thing that I'm,

943
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:40,708
it's why I'm like, oh wait a
minute, I can do this forever.

944
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:42,834
'Cause nobody believes me!

945
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:45,000
- [Man 16] Yeah.

946
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,125
- You know, like, I built a
business, a real business,

947
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:50,375
before I started talking.

948
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:52,250
And it was against odds.

949
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,333
$3,000,000, I love when
people razz me on social

950
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:56,500
and say, but his dad
gave him a $3,000,000,

951
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,333
a $3,000,000 business that
does 10% gross profit,

952
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:01,667
which is $300,000,
before expenses,

953
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:04,166
is not some fucking war chest.

954
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:06,375
Thank you business people.

955
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:08,583
(group laughter)
Do you know what I mean?

956
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,041
You know that I mean,
like there's

957
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:12,208
a ton of people here
making way more.

958
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:15,125
There was no, it was like,

959
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:18,792
and to build that from three
to 60 million, in five years,

960
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:22,291
took crazy talent as kid.

961
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:27,000
I didn't learn that at Warton.

962
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,917
And I didn't learn it
by reading Purple Cow,

963
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:32,000
I learned it
because I'm the best.

964
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,834
Naturally.

965
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,667
And now I'm just
learning how to, like,

966
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:38,333
now I'm just playing for legacy.

967
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:40,875
- [Woman] Where's the
online attention

968
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:42,583
of executives, like middle--

969
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:43,500
- LinkedIn.

970
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:46,625
Facebook.

971
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:49,750
- [Woman 2] So, with
that said--

972
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,500
- I just, black and
white tactics, you know?

973
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,208
Those two places.
- Yeah, it's really

974
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:56,000
interesting, because I,
obviously would think LinkedIn,

975
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,125
but we're getting more
from Facebook, more--

976
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:00,291
- Scale.

977
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:03,125
- [Woman 2] And I'm
sure you've given your version--

978
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:05,834
- Real quick, I apologize,
but you just might be a better

979
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:09,959
basketball player than you
are a wiffle ball player.

980
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:12,792
You just might not
be good at LinkedIn.

981
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:14,250
(group laughter)

982
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:17,792
Your rugby skills are better
than your cricket skills.

983
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:19,417
- [Woman 2]
What is your definition

984
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:22,000
of an entrepreneur,
because, I know nowadays

985
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,667
everybody--
- Nobody likes my definition.

986
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:26,208
I always get push back on this.

987
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:27,625
Just somebody who's never
worked for anybody else

988
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:28,458
in their lives.

989
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:30,583
I mean, the purest-bred
entrepreneur

990
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:31,917
couldn't breathe
with any other thing.

991
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,875
I barely barely walked
into my family business

992
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:36,500
when my dad gave
me the complete control

993
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,125
of the company right away.

994
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,583
But that's just mine.

995
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:41,500
Like, that's not, like, a
lot of people really hate

996
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,542
when I go here,
and I get a lot of push back,

997
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:46,208
and I respect that,
because it's cool to be

998
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:47,583
an entrepreneur now.

999
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:50,667
So everybody wants
to think they are.

1000
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:53,625
You're not,
if you work at Pepsi.

1001
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,500
I don't know how to cut it,
this is like when I got,

1002
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,375
there was that one talk with
me and Casey on that Q&amp;A,

1003
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:00,458
and the person asked,
like, do you think

1004
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,625
there's a difference between
men and women, and I said yes,

1005
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:03,500
and people got mad.

1006
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,542
I'm like, how is that possible?

1007
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:06,750
(group laughter)

1008
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,458
Yes, I think there's
some differences.

1009
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:10,375
I didn't say one was
better than the other,

1010
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,500
or this and that,
I'm always laughing about that,

1011
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,917
like, I don't know, maybe
you don't like me saying it,

1012
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:19,542
but, I know enough about
school that you can go

1013
00:38:19,542 --> 00:38:22,458
and look up a definition, and
I haven't seen the definition

1014
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:24,583
of an entrepreneur that
maps to the person

1015
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:26,625
that works at
Microsoft right now,

1016
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:30,250
and claims they're
an entrepreneur.

1017
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:37,875
- Well, again, I just
think that I really don't,

1018
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:39,792
I do tell you, I do say it.

1019
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:41,542
I also don't
think it really, like,

1020
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:43,250
I don't think my opinion
matters any more

1021
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,208
than anybody else's.

1022
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:47,834
I think my results
are gonna be different.

1023
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:50,959
I think that will give
it clout over time.

1024
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:52,625
But I'm not super
worried about it.

1025
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:54,792
I'm super worried about...

1026
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,208
I've realized that there's

1027
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:00,125
something I'm
doing that's right,

1028
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:04,000
I understand those things,
and I hope that they can be

1029
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
a blueprint that is not copied,

1030
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,583
but understood
contextually to yourself

1031
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:12,291
and you can get
the benefits from it,

1032
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:16,333
that may be the benefits
that you may need from it.

1033
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:18,959
Too many people want people
to emulate them, I don't.

1034
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:20,291
'Cause I know all
the weird variables

1035
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,959
that come along with me.

1036
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:25,417
I just want you to be
able to understand it,

1037
00:39:25,417 --> 00:39:28,750
understand yourself,
and then deploy it.

1038
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:32,583
- [Woman 4] Hi Gary, I have a
question about Facebook ads.

1039
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:34,792
Do you think it's more for the
brand building

1040
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:35,959
or, actually,
it can convert to sales?

1041
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:39,458
- [Gary] Both, it sells the
living shit out of stuff.

1042
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:40,834
- Because I find people
who go to Facebook,

1043
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:43,875
they're actually not
really into buying stuff.

1044
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:45,375
- Wrong.

1045
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:46,417
- [Man 17] People buy
stuff all day long.

1046
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:51,083
- Billions of dollars of
selling, billions this year.

1047
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:52,333
Most people don't
know how to do it

1048
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:54,834
because they're trying to
play Google AdWords DNA

1049
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:56,583
against Facebook.

1050
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:57,834
- [Woman 4] Okay.

1051
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:00,166
- You have a bunch of sellers

1052
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:03,375
coming to a marketing platform.

1053
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:04,625
- [Woman 4] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1054
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:08,166
- [Woman 5] To continue on
the social media page,

1055
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:10,583
you were very good at predicting
Twitter and all those--

1056
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,750
- [Gary] I'm really good
at talking about it loudly

1057
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,959
when I've decided
it's already won.

1058
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:18,125
- Okay, what has
your attention right now?

1059
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,708
Past musical.ly?

1060
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:20,333
- Not much.

1061
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:24,458
Marco Polo's an interesting
communication tool.

1062
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:26,708
After school, I invested
in a company called One,

1063
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:28,417
he pivoted,
it's called After School now,

1064
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:31,000
it's doing well in high school.

1065
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:32,500
Not much.

1066
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,291
You know what's fun?

1067
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:34,583
You know what
I've done really well?

1068
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:36,250
I haven't forced it.

1069
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:40,959
A lot of "futurists" or
"pundits" say shit

1070
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:44,375
'cause they need
another headline.

1071
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,959
I can be comfortable if
I never have another one again.

1072
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:47,542
Got it?

1073
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:48,625
That's the biggest
difference between

1074
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:53,583
me and everybody else out
there that people think are me.

1075
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:56,166
- [Woman 5] You're
just paying attention.

1076
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:57,000
- Do you see how
many people said

1077
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,834
"I told you so" about Vine?

1078
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:00,125
What the fuck does that mean?

1079
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,375
(group laughter)

1080
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:05,959
I made millions of
dollars because of Vine.

1081
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:10,959
(group laughter)

1082
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:13,667
That's like saying, "I told
you that Empire was gonna

1083
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:15,333
"eventually get cancelled."

1084
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:16,500
No shit, Dick.

1085
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:20,667
Hey!
- Sorry.

1086
00:41:20,667 --> 00:41:23,500
Good to make it,
man, how are you?

1087
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,333
Let's get him a chair.

1088
00:41:28,667 --> 00:41:30,875
Go get a different angle.

1089
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:32,708
- [Man 14] Could you deploy
this machine on a

1090
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:35,834
- Yes, yes.
- Project and revenue?

1091
00:41:35,834 --> 00:41:38,625
- Do you notice how
I tried to jump in quick?

1092
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:40,291
I can deploy this
machine against

1093
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:44,041
changing America's
opinion about Beyonce.

1094
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:49,125
- [Man 14] I know, that's
why I want that SaaS product.

1095
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:49,959
- I get it.

1096
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:53,500
And I promise you, I want
the 40 trillion dollars

1097
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,917
of valuation that my
SaaS product would get,

1098
00:41:56,917 --> 00:41:58,917
I just really want
to feel good about it.

1099
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:00,208
I really do.

1100
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:03,583
Honey empire, you know?

1101
00:42:03,583 --> 00:42:06,417
Two very big contradictions,

1102
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:11,500
but look, if you want
results that are anomaly

1103
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,041
you have to act like one,
I've said that,

1104
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:14,208
or a version of that.

1105
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:16,625
That's what's happening,
I'm pumped about this, man.

1106
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:18,917
I really hope
I can live a long life.

1107
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:21,834
You know, I watched a
movie, which is rare.

1108
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:25,083
I went to Helsinki and
got all my work done.

1109
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:29,458
I've literally watched seven
movies in the last two years

1110
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:33,125
and they've all been Europe
back to America flights

1111
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:35,583
because of the way it works
out where I get my work done,

1112
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:37,959
I get a good night's
sleep, I get on the plane,

1113
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:39,333
I have seven hours.

1114
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:40,583
I get two hours of the catch up

1115
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:43,000
of the shit I missed overnight,
and then I have this window

1116
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,458
and I'm like, what the fuck?

1117
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:45,250
(group laughter)

1118
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,250
And no Wi-Fi.

1119
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,792
It's a complete, like, you know.

1120
00:42:48,792 --> 00:42:51,125
So I watch this movie,
did you guys see the movie

1121
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:54,917
of the Indian
mathematician who dies?

1122
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:56,000
- [Group] No.

1123
00:42:57,625 --> 00:42:58,917
(laughing)

1124
00:42:58,917 --> 00:42:59,750
- You did, DRock?

1125
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,333
- [DRock] Yeah,
I saw it on the flight.

1126
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:02,583
- From Helsinki?

1127
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,000
- No, I wasn't there.
- Oh.

1128
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,083
So there's just like some--

1129
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,583
Yes!
- But on the way.

1130
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:10,417
- So, some all time great
mathematician that's in Oxford,

1131
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:12,875
but he passed away at 32,
that's probably the thing

1132
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:15,667
that's most on
my mind right now.

1133
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:19,750
Like, fuck, man, I have to
do this for me and humanity,

1134
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,083
(laughing) that's how
big of an ego I have,

1135
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:25,250
to stay alive for a long time
so I can see this through.

1136
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,291
I know I'm on to something
so fundamentally different,

1137
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:31,208
and I know that I can
inspire people to do it

1138
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,750
'cause it's gonna have
the empire part, too.

1139
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,208
See, that's what
people don't get.

1140
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:39,375
The reason I'm gonna win
is because I've got both.

1141
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:45,250
The honey part means that you
wanna go change the world.

1142
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:48,500
The empire part means
you'll do it at all costs.

1143
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,500
I'm neither.

1144
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:53,291
It's cool,
it's really interesting,

1145
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:55,458
because when I buy the Jets,

1146
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:58,583
there's gonna be a lot of
nice people that are 13

1147
00:43:58,583 --> 00:43:59,500
that are gonna
think they can build

1148
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,458
a nice, big business thing,
do it the right way.

1149
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:04,291
I'm gonna redefine

1150
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:07,166
what an entrepreneur and
businessperson is thought of.

1151
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:08,834
I think I can do it.

1152
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:11,375
(murmuring)

1153
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:12,417
Yeah, I think so.

1154
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:14,083
I think it's really different.

1155
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:15,500
That's why I'm dangerous.

1156
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,417
All the people that I'm
not as pumped with online,

1157
00:44:18,417 --> 00:44:21,750
watches, this and that, selling
stuff, they're scared of me

1158
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:26,041
because I'm better at
their shtick than they are.

1159
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:28,333
So I'm dangerous.

1160
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,291
It's fucking fun.

1161
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:33,041
- Do you have
many goals set up in--

1162
00:44:33,041 --> 00:44:34,250
- [Gary] Let me get the
guy behind you real quick

1163
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,875
because he's been
so awesomely patient.

1164
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:39,417
- Short back story,
basic question.

1165
00:44:39,417 --> 00:44:42,708
I am video production,
aerial, and design.

1166
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:44,959
First year, Ramen noodles,
renting all my gear,

1167
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:46,417
building clientele.

1168
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:50,083
Last two years, a lot of
success, 16 to 18 hour days,

1169
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:53,417
and my dream is not that
big, it's 5 to 7 people

1170
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:56,375
all on the crew, doing bigger
than what I can alone.

1171
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:57,208
- [Gary] Love it.

1172
00:44:57,208 --> 00:45:00,500
- How do I keep the momentum
and build that team?

1173
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,500
'Cause I'm tired, I love it and
I keep going, but I'm tired.

1174
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:08,166
- By eating
Ramen noodles longer.

1175
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:13,083
(murmuring)

1176
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:17,041
You know, give up
more money for yourself

1177
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:19,959
and give them to people.

1178
00:45:21,917 --> 00:45:25,250
The 100 and the 67
that I just talked about.

1179
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:26,583
I did it, man.

1180
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:27,792
All my friends,

1181
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:29,125
I built Wine Library from a

1182
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:31,041
$3 to a $60 million business,

1183
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:35,583
and got none of the fruits
that a 26-year-old dude

1184
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:37,583
would love to take advantage of.

1185
00:45:37,583 --> 00:45:42,083
Didn't even fucking
step into New York City.

1186
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:45,583
You know,
I started paying myself 280,

1187
00:45:45,583 --> 00:45:48,583
I hired Ray Prado.

1188
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:52,542
Miss you Ray. You know?

1189
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:54,583
You know what's cool
about my answer?

1190
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:57,208
It's the only true
answer to your question.

1191
00:45:57,208 --> 00:45:58,959
Either you work and you're tired

1192
00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:00,917
so you can keep
more of the money,

1193
00:46:00,917 --> 00:46:03,291
or you don't have the
fruits that come along

1194
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:04,291
with a little more money,

1195
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:05,875
and the fruits
are very basic, right?

1196
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:09,792
It's not like you went from
that to caviar every night,

1197
00:46:09,792 --> 00:46:11,208
it's just whatever
is a little bit better,

1198
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:14,583
but you can get very used
to that better than before

1199
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:16,000
and it stops you.

1200
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:19,375
(murmuring)

1201
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:22,875
This stuff is so basic.

1202
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:25,959
It's basic, it's hard.

1203
00:46:25,959 --> 00:46:28,250
It's hard.
It's hard.

1204
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,250
We're not wired for it.

1205
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:33,667
We want stuff now.

1206
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:35,083
But I just don't.

1207
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:40,125
- What wines are
you drinking now?

1208
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:40,959
- That's a good question,

1209
00:46:40,959 --> 00:46:42,500
wine's been a very
interesting journey for me.

1210
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,792
Because I'm not in
the business anymore,

1211
00:46:45,792 --> 00:46:48,417
I like it again.

1212
00:46:48,417 --> 00:46:51,000
It's so fun,
I'm a customer again.

1213
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,583
Actually, I'm a customer for
the first time in my life.

1214
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:57,500
To answer your question,
weird shit, it's so crazy,

1215
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,333
literally, it blows me away
that I'm going to say this,

1216
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:02,166
this is actually very non-nerdy,

1217
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:05,834
I'm embarrassed in my
wine-self, I'm really hot

1218
00:47:05,834 --> 00:47:07,375
on oaked chardonnay.

1219
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:08,375
It's the thing that
I made fun of

1220
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:10,875
for 10 years on Wine Library TV.

1221
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:14,000
But that's just a palate change.

1222
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,291
Like, I grew up my whole
life not liking chocolate

1223
00:47:17,291 --> 00:47:18,667
and liking the
other kind of candy,

1224
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:20,625
and now I'm the reverse.

1225
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:21,625
Palette's are, you too?

1226
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:22,708
- [Woman 4] Mhmmm, same thing.

1227
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:23,750
- Yeah, I don't even
know when it happened.

1228
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:24,875
- [Woman 4] When I got
pregnant, that's how I got it.

1229
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,083
(group laughter)

1230
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:28,041
- Not me.
(group laughter)

1231
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:32,542
So, oaked chardonnays,
a lot of Piedmont wines,

1232
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:35,708
a lot of barolos, I think
that's the next category to pop

1233
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:39,959
like the way burgundy did,
low-production barolo.

1234
00:47:39,959 --> 00:47:41,750
- I brought some from
Finger Lakes for you.

1235
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:42,708
- [Gary] I love it man,
Riesling?

1236
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:43,250
- Yeah.

1237
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:46,291
- [Gary] Awesome, thank you
so much, that's very nice.

1238
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:47,917
Let's keep it going.

1239
00:47:47,917 --> 00:47:52,417
- So I loved the document
Don't Create message,--

1240
00:47:52,417 --> 00:47:54,625
- [Gary] Mhmmm.
it resonated with me big time.

1241
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:55,959
- [Gary] That was a
big game changer,

1242
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:56,750
as a matter of fact, DRock,

1243
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,250
we're doing a bad job
building on that momentum.

1244
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,917
We need to do much more
content about that.

1245
00:48:00,917 --> 00:48:03,208
That has been a game
changing piece of content

1246
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:04,417
for a lot of people.

1247
00:48:04,417 --> 00:48:06,959
- It was tricky because
I'm a creative director

1248
00:48:06,959 --> 00:48:09,000
(laughing) so I was like,

1249
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,417
hmm, how do I not
create and perfect,

1250
00:48:11,417 --> 00:48:14,000
and I know you're just
like, ship it, get it out.

1251
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,333
- I mean,
early Wine Library TV is...

1252
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,166
- And that helped--
- They're hearing well.

1253
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:26,000
- Inspired when
I saw you in the hallway.

1254
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,458
What you do, are you
agreeing with me, like boom?

1255
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:30,875
- And you know what's so
interesting about that,

1256
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:34,917
you know me, if it wasn't
stat, it had no chance.

1257
00:48:34,917 --> 00:48:38,458
- Oh, sure.
- [Gary] You know?

1258
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:41,667
Do you know how desperate
I am to go into that club

1259
00:48:41,667 --> 00:48:43,125
and do the reading for you?

1260
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:45,583
It's just time, I can't win.

1261
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:47,583
But you did it fast,
and we did it.

1262
00:48:47,583 --> 00:48:48,250
- [Woman 2] I loved it.

1263
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,792
- And it's a really
interesting insight for you

1264
00:48:50,792 --> 00:48:52,208
because you lived it with me.

1265
00:48:52,208 --> 00:48:53,959
You wanted me to
go do that event,

1266
00:48:53,959 --> 00:48:56,542
we have a great little
rapport with each other,

1267
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:57,917
I desperately want to,
I said I would,

1268
00:48:57,917 --> 00:49:02,041
I never like to go back on
my word, it destroys me,

1269
00:49:02,041 --> 00:49:03,208
but, and then that.

1270
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:06,542
You know,
that's interesting, doing.

1271
00:49:06,542 --> 00:49:08,500
Doing is the only fucking game.

1272
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,834
- [Woman 2] Yeah, and I mean,
I loved it because I got to see

1273
00:49:11,834 --> 00:49:14,291
a little bit more into you,

1274
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:18,625
because I think you are so
incredibly generous and kind,

1275
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:21,166
but when you started to
talk about your grandmother,

1276
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:24,208
it just, everything
sort of melted away,

1277
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:27,375
you were so happy,
and I really felt--

1278
00:49:27,375 --> 00:49:28,875
- And you know what's
interesting about it?

1279
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:31,125
That's the grandmother that
I actually have publicly said

1280
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:33,875
multiple times is not
a very nice person.

1281
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:34,750
- [Woman 2] Well, I believe it.

1282
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:39,625
- But where it went for me
is my grandma represents

1283
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:43,000
the bigger thing, which is,

1284
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,792
and I even get emotional
about it and I never do,

1285
00:49:44,792 --> 00:49:47,375
as you guys know, this
group of 13 characters

1286
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:51,625
that came to this country
with nothing, zero.

1287
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:54,000
Like, zero.

1288
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,917
Zero, $100 because
we sold our shit in Italy

1289
00:49:57,917 --> 00:49:59,875
while we were waiting
to get to this country.

1290
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:01,125
It was supposed to
be paved with gold,

1291
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:05,291
but oh wait, it's the late
70s and it's a recession time.

1292
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:10,291
Fucking grinded, forever.

1293
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:12,417
These kids that are like, ugh.

1294
00:50:12,417 --> 00:50:14,834
Like, kids who grow
up in good families

1295
00:50:14,834 --> 00:50:18,041
and don't want to grind for
a year before they want shit,

1296
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:21,166
this was 20 years of building.

1297
00:50:21,166 --> 00:50:25,500
I just dismissed a
$3 million business,

1298
00:50:26,625 --> 00:50:28,542
even the tone that
I brought it with,

1299
00:50:28,542 --> 00:50:31,750
that took my dad his whole
life to get to that point,

1300
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,625
'cause that's what you
do when you have zero.

1301
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:34,792
How dare I do that?

1302
00:50:34,792 --> 00:50:36,542
He had zero.

1303
00:50:36,542 --> 00:50:37,959
- [Woman] How do you keep
your kids grounded?

1304
00:50:37,959 --> 00:50:39,125
- You don't.

1305
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:40,750
I'll get back to that.

1306
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,542
- It reminded me of my
grandmother, they came with

1307
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:44,375
that as well and
I got very choked up,

1308
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:45,250
kind of like.

1309
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,291
- [Gary] Yeah.

1310
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:50,750
- But I am a very patient person

1311
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:53,875
and I have been building
this live story-telling show

1312
00:50:53,875 --> 00:50:55,417
and podcast and
now we're starting

1313
00:50:55,417 --> 00:50:56,708
to do storytelling workshops.

1314
00:50:56,708 --> 00:50:58,166
I talked to
Steve and Claude here

1315
00:50:58,166 --> 00:51:00,208
about doing them here as well,

1316
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:03,625
and I have started
talking to local partners

1317
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:05,959
about how we can work together.

1318
00:51:05,959 --> 00:51:09,542
And with some of these partners,
their social media numbers

1319
00:51:09,542 --> 00:51:12,083
are off the charts
compared to mine.

1320
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:14,125
And I know for
the podcast in order

1321
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:16,708
to interest advertisers
that you need

1322
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:18,750
to have a certain
number of listeners

1323
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:19,583
and downloads
and all that stuff.

1324
00:51:19,583 --> 00:51:21,083
- I don't believe
that by the way.

1325
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:22,083
- Okay.

1326
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:22,792
I believe that that's the way

1327
00:51:22,792 --> 00:51:24,917
the majority of
the market does it.

1328
00:51:24,917 --> 00:51:27,792
I think that if you're a
really good salesperson.

1329
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:30,667
Did you ever see the video
where I cold-called somebody?

1330
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:33,125
(group crosstalk)

1331
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:36,500
I think you could, so
you're so understanding

1332
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:40,083
of this industry,
that's your break.

1333
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:43,792
I think you should spend
an hour a day cold-calling,

1334
00:51:43,792 --> 00:51:46,667
cold pitching a sponsorship deal

1335
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:50,375
on your podcast that makes
no mathematical sense.

1336
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:52,208
- Well, it's like a local,

1337
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:54,166
so I make ice cream cakes
for this show that I do

1338
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:57,708
and there's a local place
who is blowing up right now

1339
00:51:57,708 --> 00:51:59,125
and they're very interested.

1340
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:00,708
- Yeah but I would
go to Ben and Jerry's

1341
00:52:00,708 --> 00:52:03,083
and just see if
you can get 'em there.

1342
00:52:03,083 --> 00:52:04,667
- They're about to be as
big as Ben and Jerry's.

1343
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:06,542
- But they're not.

1344
00:52:06,542 --> 00:52:08,917
- But they're
selling like crazy.

1345
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:13,083
- But they don't have a $100,000
sponsorship check for you.

1346
00:52:14,166 --> 00:52:17,166
- [Woman 2] Right,
so then I'm wondering what,

1347
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:18,458
I have a lot to offer

1348
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:22,500
them I just wonder how do I...

1349
00:52:23,291 --> 00:52:24,542
- You ask them.

1350
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,333
- [Woman 2] Obviously I have
no problem asking.

1351
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:33,125
- I know, so go ask them.

1352
00:52:34,959 --> 00:52:36,542
- Then I have to figure out
the numbers and what we need

1353
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:37,500
and all that kind of stuff.

1354
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:42,750
- Don't sell them numbers,
you don't have them.

1355
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:47,458
But not only that, that's
the module to get there.

1356
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:51,667
Never sell on your weakness.

1357
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:54,583
You shouldn't figure out any
numbers, you don't have them.

1358
00:52:54,583 --> 00:52:57,708
- [Woman 2] No I don't and what
got people excited about it,

1359
00:52:57,708 --> 00:53:01,208
at least locally is my
enthusiasm, my passion,

1360
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:02,875
I mean I have
an hour long meeting.

1361
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:03,708
- I know you.

1362
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:06,125
You better sell that.

1363
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:07,875
- [Man 4] Can you
do for yourself

1364
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:09,250
what you just did for her?

1365
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,959
- [Gary] What's that?

1366
00:53:11,959 --> 00:53:13,000
- [Man 4] Most of
us in this room

1367
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,125
can't see the forest through

1368
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:15,542
the trees when it
comes to our own stuff.

1369
00:53:15,542 --> 00:53:16,458
- [Gary] Right, okay.

1370
00:53:16,458 --> 00:53:17,708
- But somebody else can,

1371
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:19,625
I can sit here and
listen to anybody

1372
00:53:19,625 --> 00:53:20,959
and they can do the same for me.

1373
00:53:20,959 --> 00:53:22,291
Can you do that for yourself?

1374
00:53:22,291 --> 00:53:23,834
- I think that's what I did.

1375
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:26,166
That's what I think I do best.

1376
00:53:26,166 --> 00:53:27,583
- [Man 4] Where does
that come from?

1377
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:28,625
Is that who you are?

1378
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:30,041
- Yeah, I think so.

1379
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:31,458
You know, that's
actually what I do.

1380
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,959
That's why I'm so
good at what I do.

1381
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,750
I'm looking at me right now
just like you're looking at me.

1382
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,458
And that talent
has been huge for me.

1383
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:38,291
- [Man 4] How often do you?

1384
00:53:38,291 --> 00:53:40,208
- That's self-awareness
really, or a version of it.

1385
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:41,667
- [Man 4] How often do they
call you out and say,

1386
00:53:41,667 --> 00:53:44,041
you don't see the forest,
these are just the trees?

1387
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:45,792
Do they ever?

1388
00:53:45,792 --> 00:53:46,500
What does that look like?

1389
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,500
- I don't even know if
they do or if they don't.

1390
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:52,041
It's like literally white noise.

1391
00:53:52,041 --> 00:53:53,708
There's no executive
here or out there

1392
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:56,041
that can possibly penetrate.

1393
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:00,125
They just can't.

1394
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:02,458
I haven't listened to
anybody in my whole life.

1395
00:54:02,458 --> 00:54:03,417
- [Man 8] Is that why your dad

1396
00:54:03,417 --> 00:54:04,500
let you take charge
of his company?

1397
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,166
- Probably, you know
what's so funny?

1398
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:08,917
I swear to God
I've never thought of this,

1399
00:54:08,917 --> 00:54:10,125
maybe I just took it.

1400
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:11,166
Maybe he didn't give it to me.

1401
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:12,750
(laughs)

1402
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,917
I'm being dead serious,
I'm actually gonna ask him.

1403
00:54:14,917 --> 00:54:17,625
You might just
be right about that.

1404
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:20,208
Maybe he didn't and the
truth is, knowing my dad,

1405
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:21,625
he probably definitely didn't.

1406
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:23,125
(laughter)

1407
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:25,041
No question,
there's some of that.

1408
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:28,166
Maybe my dad, you know
I was razzin' him in EQ,

1409
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:30,208
maybe he understood there
was no other option.

1410
00:54:30,208 --> 00:54:31,458
Either that's what
it was going to be

1411
00:54:31,458 --> 00:54:33,625
or I was going to
go garage sale until...

1412
00:54:33,625 --> 00:54:35,208
I was willing to do anything.

1413
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:37,166
I really struggled
entering my dad's business.

1414
00:54:37,166 --> 00:54:38,917
I didn't want that comment
on YouTube about the

1415
00:54:38,917 --> 00:54:40,959
three million, I didn't
want it because I know

1416
00:54:40,959 --> 00:54:42,083
I didn't need it.

1417
00:54:42,083 --> 00:54:45,166
Because I knew
it wasn't that much.

1418
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:47,583
- [Man 15] Best place to travel
outside the United States?

1419
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:52,750
- Turks and Caicos, and
I think the reason that is,

1420
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:55,041
I've thought about this and
that's why I was able to

1421
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:58,500
give you a follow up is
really hardcore, fond

1422
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:02,375
family moments, you know
me and Lizzie by ourselves.

1423
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:04,834
The kids,
one trip with my parents,

1424
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,500
Mike Lazarou,
founder of BuddyMedia

1425
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,583
had a place,
just real family.

1426
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:12,125
Yeah, Turks.

1427
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:15,917
- [Man 16] I got engaged there
two years ago, it was amazing.

1428
00:55:15,917 --> 00:55:18,875
Quick question, I'm in the
wedding industry,

1429
00:55:18,875 --> 00:55:22,125
grew up in a business,
took it almost from my father,--

1430
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:24,875
- Yep, yeah.

1431
00:55:24,875 --> 00:55:25,542
- [Man 16] because
he had no choice

1432
00:55:25,542 --> 00:55:27,458
right it was kind
of that dynamic.

1433
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:30,792
But the question I have now
is that in the entertainment

1434
00:55:30,792 --> 00:55:32,708
world we do mostly weddings,

1435
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:36,875
and so within the wedding
industry everybody's a small

1436
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,125
business, small photographer,
small DJ, small florist,

1437
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:40,000
everybody's small.

1438
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,083
What I've done now is I've
signed a 10 year lease

1439
00:55:42,083 --> 00:55:45,125
to build what's gonna be called
the wedding establishment,

1440
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:47,500
and I vertically integrated
to create all these small

1441
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,834
businesses under my
name under one roof.

1442
00:55:49,834 --> 00:55:50,959
The question I have is...

1443
00:55:50,959 --> 00:55:52,417
- You want to be Vince McMahon?

1444
00:55:52,417 --> 00:55:55,000
- Kind of, I want to
be Gary Vaynerchuk.

1445
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
The thing is
reverse engineering it,

1446
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,166
and if say in 10 years
I do want to sell it

1447
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:03,834
at 7-10 million or whatever.

1448
00:56:03,834 --> 00:56:06,333
The fact of the matter
is that small businesses

1449
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:08,166
in the wedding industry,
they just don't have that kind

1450
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:09,959
of money.

1451
00:56:09,959 --> 00:56:13,417
Where would I go to sell
something at that level?

1452
00:56:13,417 --> 00:56:16,959
- So one thing that people
are confused by is who

1453
00:56:16,959 --> 00:56:19,708
might buy something in business?

1454
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:21,000
Unlimited people.

1455
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,667
First of all, you worry about
building a business that's

1456
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:26,125
profitable, you can sell it.

1457
00:56:29,125 --> 00:56:32,667
I mean, what do you think
New York City is built on?

1458
00:56:32,667 --> 00:56:36,625
It's banking, it's, you have
a business that's profitable

1459
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:37,708
you can sell it.

1460
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:39,417
I'll buy it.

1461
00:56:39,417 --> 00:56:41,792
Because I'll look at it and
be like I can do that better,

1462
00:56:41,792 --> 00:56:44,583
and I'll buy it at what he's
got it at and I'll run it

1463
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:47,500
through my machine and
it'll be worth a lot more.

1464
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,750
- [Man 14] Vayner weddings?

1465
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:49,959
- Interested.

1466
00:56:49,959 --> 00:56:51,625
(group laughter)

1467
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:52,708
You know what I mean?

1468
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:55,166
That's a really silly, and
by the way I say a lot of

1469
00:56:55,166 --> 00:56:57,375
silly things in the world
that I don't come from.

1470
00:56:57,375 --> 00:57:00,792
That's an unbelievably
silly question.

1471
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:04,625
'Cause you're thinking
so micro, dude.

1472
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:07,708
You can sell it to the guy
in town that's so impressed

1473
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:10,375
who wants to buy a
business for his loser son.

1474
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:13,875
- [Man 14] But the thing is it's
a wedding and there's no.

1475
00:57:13,875 --> 00:57:16,375
- I don't even understand
what you're saying.

1476
00:57:16,375 --> 00:57:17,041
- [Man 14] Okay.

1477
00:57:17,041 --> 00:57:18,417
- You are so micro-ed out.

1478
00:57:18,417 --> 00:57:20,083
- [Man 14] Okay.

1479
00:57:22,917 --> 00:57:24,750
I get it, okay.

1480
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,625
- You should get it.

1481
00:57:27,417 --> 00:57:29,708
There's private equity,
there's banks, there's rich

1482
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:33,000
people who have loser sons,
there's a wedding company

1483
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,708
that you never heard of that's
going to become the uber of

1484
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:36,834
weddings that wants it.

1485
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:39,208
You have kids?

1486
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:40,250
- 15.

1487
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:41,750
- You have a 15 year old?

1488
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,583
(group laughter)

1489
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:45,625
I followed.
I followed.

1490
00:57:46,834 --> 00:57:47,667
Them.

1491
00:57:48,458 --> 00:57:52,166
There's a million different
things that can happen.

1492
00:57:52,166 --> 00:57:54,333
You're caught so deep.

1493
00:57:54,333 --> 00:57:57,417
I wanna raz you because you
can take it, you're so deep

1494
00:57:57,417 --> 00:57:59,166
in it and it makes no sense.

1495
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:01,458
- I just think
it's very specific.

1496
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:04,041
- [Gary] Period, you just
thought, way too much.

1497
00:58:04,041 --> 00:58:04,625
- Sorry.

1498
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:06,583
No, no it makes sense.

1499
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:07,542
- [Gary] That's no problem.

1500
00:58:07,542 --> 00:58:09,667
Build a business.
- Yeah.

1501
00:58:09,667 --> 00:58:11,333
Everything else will be fine.

1502
00:58:11,333 --> 00:58:14,250
- Gotcha, love it.

1503
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,417
- [Gary] You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

1504
00:58:16,417 --> 00:58:18,458
- [Gary] I'm just pumped
for you, that's why I'm razzing

1505
00:58:18,458 --> 00:58:20,792
because that's
not a problem at all.

1506
00:58:20,792 --> 00:58:22,625
Cashing out is not a problem
when you have something

1507
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:25,792
that's good.

1508
00:58:25,792 --> 00:58:28,333
Hey. One more here.

1509
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:30,250
- [Woman 5] I have a small
family business that's about

1510
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:33,792
three and a half years old now,
and the biggest issue we seem

1511
00:58:33,792 --> 00:58:36,750
to have is we have
minimum wage employees.

1512
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:39,041
We are having problems
recruiting and retaining
them.

1513
00:58:39,041 --> 00:58:42,375
I never heard you say anything
about the lower paying jobs,

1514
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:43,792
do you have any
advice on that?

1515
00:58:43,792 --> 00:58:45,792
- I sure do,
do you talk to them?

1516
00:58:45,792 --> 00:58:46,625
- [Woman 5] Yes.

1517
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:49,417
- Do you really know
what they care and like?

1518
00:58:49,417 --> 00:58:50,834
- Yeah, I feel like I do, yeah.

1519
00:58:50,834 --> 00:58:52,458
- Well then you
should have no problem.

1520
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:54,625
- [Woman 5] Even
with recruiting,

1521
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:57,375
what I've found is go
through loads and loads

1522
00:58:57,375 --> 00:59:00,667
of different people,
you find one or two.

1523
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:03,625
It's really difficult
to find those people.

1524
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:04,834
With the low wages.

1525
00:59:04,834 --> 00:59:06,708
- How are you making
that decision when you go

1526
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:08,291
through loads and loads of
people, to find that one

1527
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:09,708
diamond in the rough?

1528
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:12,583
- My gut, basically.

1529
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:15,000
- You're overestimating
your gut.

1530
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,375
I think I have the
greatest gut of all time.

1531
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:18,291
I hire everybody.

1532
00:59:20,834 --> 00:59:22,583
You passed on the 10 best
employees you could have

1533
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:24,583
ever had.
- [Woman 5] Okay.

1534
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:27,250
- Got it?
- [Woman 5] Mhmmm.

1535
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:30,375
- You have got to build
scalability in unscalable
things.

1536
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:34,417
That's, as I'm thinking about
it, that's where I get it.

1537
00:59:34,417 --> 00:59:37,333
I do unscalable things,
but everything I do about

1538
00:59:37,333 --> 00:59:38,792
them is scaled.

1539
00:59:38,792 --> 00:59:41,208
Like it's kind of
interesting that way.

1540
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:44,458
Let's go ahead, and then
we'll go over there.

1541
00:59:44,458 --> 00:59:46,500
- If culture's number one,
then what's your number two?

1542
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,583
- [Gary] Culture.

1543
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:50,500
(group laughter)

1544
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,834
I mean, and then the other
thing that matters is

1545
00:59:51,834 --> 00:59:53,834
running good business, right?

1546
00:59:53,834 --> 00:59:57,000
But culture is number two.

1547
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,041
Yeah, it's so big.

1548
00:59:58,041 --> 00:59:59,583
I mean I'm in the people
business.

1549
00:59:59,583 --> 01:00:01,000
The hell am I doing here?

1550
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,959
But I did that with
Wine Library too,

1551
01:00:02,959 --> 01:00:04,291
even though we sold wine.

1552
01:00:04,291 --> 01:00:08,166
'Cause you're always
in the people business.

1553
01:00:13,917 --> 01:00:15,834
You can't fake environment.

1554
01:00:17,959 --> 01:00:21,000
You can't fake environment.

1555
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,333
My kids are going to grow
up on the Upper East Side,

1556
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:24,875
go to private schools, have
friends that are on the

1557
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:28,417
Aspen ski team but they live
in New York because they

1558
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,708
take a private
plane after school

1559
01:00:30,708 --> 01:00:32,166
on Thursday and go to Aspen.

1560
01:00:32,166 --> 01:00:33,375
This is real.

1561
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:36,500
I'm gonna be ridiculously
famous and wealthy.

1562
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,500
I'm not gonna be able
to fake environment.

1563
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,458
I need to teach them truths.

1564
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:42,959
But are they gonna
be as hungry as I am?

1565
01:00:42,959 --> 01:00:43,792
Unlikely.

1566
01:00:43,792 --> 01:00:46,083
Maybe, maybe it's just a
hardcore DNA thing and they

1567
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:47,959
were able to overpower
environment.

1568
01:00:47,959 --> 01:00:49,500
Maybe they look at my
mountain and they say

1569
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,333
"Fuck you, Dad.
I'm gonna climb it."

1570
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:52,834
Like I did.

1571
01:00:52,834 --> 01:00:54,875
Jesus Christ,
my dad seemed really

1572
01:00:54,875 --> 01:00:55,708
successful to me because that

1573
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:59,375
was my context, I didn't
know about the Zucks or

1574
01:00:59,375 --> 01:01:00,542
Bill Gates.

1575
01:01:00,542 --> 01:01:03,417
I didn't think about that,
so you just can't fake

1576
01:01:03,417 --> 01:01:04,708
environment though.

1577
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:08,208
And that's why I always
laugh at these rich parents

1578
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:11,083
because they try,
and those are tactics.

1579
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:14,625
We're gonna send them to a
camp in Maine this summer

1580
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:16,166
that doesn't have
air conditioning.

1581
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:19,500
Oh yeah, Johnny is really
gonna be hungry.

1582
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,792
I mean, are you kidding me?

1583
01:01:21,792 --> 01:01:23,166
Alright hold on, one second.

1584
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:25,125
Let me get here
and I'll come back.

1585
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:29,083
- [Alex]Cabe is a middle school
principal,--
- [Gary] Cabe?

1586
01:01:29,083 --> 01:01:31,333
Oh, damn. But respect.

1587
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:32,875
- [Alex] He teaches
entrepreneurship.

1588
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:35,083
If you ran your own middle
school, what's the first class

1589
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:37,333
you would drop and what
would you replace it with?

1590
01:01:37,333 --> 01:01:38,959
- That's a great question.

1591
01:01:38,959 --> 01:01:43,458
I would drop, first
class I would drop, fuck,

1592
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:46,250
it's interesting, I respect
and disrespect them all

1593
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:49,083
equally in some weird way.

1594
01:01:49,083 --> 01:01:53,834
I would audit every kid,
one by one,

1595
01:01:53,834 --> 01:01:56,458
figure out what they were weakest at

1596
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:58,792
and make them drop that.

1597
01:01:58,792 --> 01:02:00,458
Then make them double down
on what I thought they

1598
01:02:00,458 --> 01:02:03,708
were strongest at.

1599
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:08,125
That's the game.
I'll come back to you next.

1600
01:02:08,792 --> 01:02:11,500
- [Woman 6] How do you ignore
what everybody else is doing

1601
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,375
and not compare
yourself to anybody else?

1602
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:17,875
- Because I think
I'm better than them.

1603
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:22,166
That's a really tough
thing to even say out loud,

1604
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:24,708
but it's the truth
to your question.

1605
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:28,959
I just do, it's so crazy.

1606
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:33,458
Back to the SaaS product,
I'm sitting on this

1607
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:37,125
perfectly parented because
I know it could be all time.

1608
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:39,458
But I've got to really
give it my all.

1609
01:02:39,458 --> 01:02:41,834
I could half ass crush it
and it's gonna be a monster,

1610
01:02:41,834 --> 01:02:45,542
and real valuable, but I've
gotta really, really drill this

1611
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:48,917
perfectly parented because
it could be all time.

1612
01:02:48,917 --> 01:02:49,959
Like all time.

1613
01:02:49,959 --> 01:02:55,166
Like, Bible, perfectly parented.

1614
01:02:55,166 --> 01:02:57,625
- [Man 6] Spring 2007,
can you tell us

1615
01:02:57,625 --> 01:02:59,083
when your parents comes out?

1616
01:02:59,083 --> 01:03:00,542
- Is that right?
- [Man 6] Yeah, I wrote it.

1617
01:03:00,542 --> 01:03:02,542
Love it,
I think I can write it better.

1618
01:03:02,542 --> 01:03:03,917
(group laughter)

1619
01:03:03,917 --> 01:03:06,166
Because you know the
truth is nothing we do,

1620
01:03:06,166 --> 01:03:08,083
nothing, all this stuff
has been said, and

1621
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:09,625
then that's the,
you know what I mean.

1622
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:13,041
Love that and I believe
that, but like everybody's

1623
01:03:13,041 --> 01:03:13,875
got their version of it.

1624
01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:16,291
I feel it deep within my
soul I got good one in me,

1625
01:03:16,291 --> 01:03:17,333
I can't wait to.

1626
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:18,959
But that's awesome,
man I love that shit.

1627
01:03:18,959 --> 01:03:20,792
- This is from Matthew.

1628
01:03:20,792 --> 01:03:23,792
What's the next big advertising
platform you see coming,

1629
01:03:23,792 --> 01:03:24,792
Twitter is struggling,

1630
01:03:24,792 --> 01:03:26,792
Reddit just came out
with interest based ads,

1631
01:03:26,792 --> 01:03:29,208
and Snap is teasing
us with ad platforms.

1632
01:03:29,208 --> 01:03:31,041
Facebook ad costs are going up.

1633
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:34,208
So I'm trying to see
down the road.

1634
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:35,083
- I don't know.

1635
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:37,000
I think Facebook is
grossly under priced.

1636
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,917
I think influencers are
grossly under priced.

1637
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:42,291
I'm not worried about
who's doing what next.

1638
01:03:42,291 --> 01:03:45,500
I just don't have a care,
I have zero interest in

1639
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:49,583
what's next,
I only care about what's now.

1640
01:03:49,583 --> 01:03:52,208
It doesn't matter.

1641
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:54,500
It'll matter when it happens.

1642
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,291
- [Man 6] And that's what
you sell your clients?

1643
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:58,083
- 100%.

1644
01:03:58,083 --> 01:04:00,583
I don't sell, VaynerMedia
doesn't sell the future.

1645
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:01,959
VaynerMedia sells the now.

1646
01:04:01,959 --> 01:04:03,875
It feels like the future
when you do television and

1647
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:06,500
direct mail and outdoor.
(group laughter)

1648
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:10,000
I sell the now, always have,
most practical guy in the room.

1649
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,875
Don't have the personality
that feels practical.

1650
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:14,708
And most people don't
think it's practical because

1651
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:17,083
everybody plays in the past.

1652
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:20,417
Because the past
is for average players.

1653
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:25,208
The data, data told you
what happened,

1654
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:27,125
not where it's going.

1655
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:31,166
Big data is a farce,
you have to interpret it

1656
01:04:31,166 --> 01:04:33,250
and make a decision.

1657
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:36,583
- [Man 8] When you're
strategizing with companies,

1658
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:40,375
do you ever tell the CEO's that
they should build their brand

1659
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:43,166
because I feel like it's such
a huge underutilized platform.

1660
01:04:43,166 --> 01:04:45,792
Like traction channel for
a company, like why aren't

1661
01:04:45,792 --> 01:04:47,625
more executives
building their brands up?

1662
01:04:47,625 --> 01:04:48,458
- I really don't.

1663
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:49,500
It's not what we're
being hired for.

1664
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,667
VaynerTALENT might be
interesting, we might have a CEO

1665
01:04:51,667 --> 01:04:54,667
from Hewlett Packard
that wants it.

1666
01:04:54,667 --> 01:04:58,125
- [Man 8] They have literally 50
Twitter followers sometimes.

1667
01:04:58,125 --> 01:05:00,750
- Yeah, I mean they don't care.

1668
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,542
Do you know how many
people make $91 million

1669
01:05:02,542 --> 01:05:04,458
a year that you've
never heard of?

1670
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:06,375
- [Man 8] Mid- sized businesses,
don't you think the traction

1671
01:05:06,375 --> 01:05:07,375
channel they can--

1672
01:05:07,375 --> 01:05:08,667
- I do, but do you know how
many people are introverted

1673
01:05:08,667 --> 01:05:11,333
and not interesting and
don't like people, bad dudes?

1674
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:13,458
- [Man 8] Like 7%, 30%...

1675
01:05:13,458 --> 01:05:16,667
- I agree I tell them every day.

1676
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:18,208
They can find me.

1677
01:05:18,208 --> 01:05:19,458
You know what I mean?

1678
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:21,834
It's out there, I believe in it.

1679
01:05:24,083 --> 01:05:25,875
Yes I do, I think they should.

1680
01:05:25,875 --> 01:05:28,333
- [Man 8] It's something
everyone else is doing in

1681
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:31,166
marketing and sales,
but there's not this much

1682
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:34,625
competition in that space.

1683
01:05:34,625 --> 01:05:36,959
- You're right.

1684
01:05:38,667 --> 01:05:41,083
I'm just not interested in
convincing anybody to do

1685
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:44,458
anything kind of, I have
this weird non-sell thing.

1686
01:05:44,458 --> 01:05:46,166
You know?

1687
01:05:46,166 --> 01:05:48,125
I just viscerally hate to sell.

1688
01:05:48,125 --> 01:05:50,000
People don't get it.

1689
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,959
- [Man 9] Is it because
you're so good at it?

1690
01:05:51,959 --> 01:05:53,291
- No, I wish that was it.

1691
01:05:53,291 --> 01:05:56,458
That's a cool, I may just
take that because it's cool.

1692
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:57,083
(group laughter)

1693
01:05:57,083 --> 01:05:58,625
- No I just don't like it.

1694
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:00,166
- [Man 9] Because it's
manipulation?

1695
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:02,125
- No it's like I just don't
want anybody to have the

1696
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,250
leverage, and if you're asking

1697
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:05,458
the other person
has the leverage.

1698
01:06:06,792 --> 01:06:08,959
You know?

1699
01:06:08,959 --> 01:06:12,917
So I just sell on
having it come to me.

1700
01:06:12,917 --> 01:06:15,083
So if a CEO emailed me and said
I want to build my personal

1701
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:17,458
brand, I'm thrilled to
have that conversation.

1702
01:06:17,458 --> 01:06:20,959
But I'm not gonna tweet you
and be like, "Hey Rick."

1703
01:06:20,959 --> 01:06:22,291
You know?

1704
01:06:24,834 --> 01:06:26,792
- [Alex] It's from Kellie Kelly.

1705
01:06:26,792 --> 01:06:28,792
- Kellie Kelly.

1706
01:06:28,792 --> 01:06:30,917
- [Alex] I'm struggling to
convince clients the value of

1707
01:06:30,917 --> 01:06:35,375
putting out digital content
consistently as you explained

1708
01:06:35,375 --> 01:06:38,542
brands having to become
their own media outlet.

1709
01:06:38,542 --> 01:06:40,542
How important is
it to story tell?

1710
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:43,083
I am struggling to convince
them that this is the way.

1711
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:44,917
- You're selling the wrong
people, Kellie Kelly.

1712
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:46,458
Find the ones
that are sell-able.

1713
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:49,000
That's just it.

1714
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,500
I mean I'm sure as people
have gone down my rabbit hole,

1715
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,792
the thing that's probably most
interesting is two things,

1716
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:57,458
I think I'm asking
you guys actually.

1717
01:06:57,458 --> 01:07:00,708
One, how historically
correct I was.

1718
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:04,333
And two, how very little
has changed in my message

1719
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:07,500
over the last decade.

1720
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:08,291
And that's it.

1721
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:09,959
I don't think you should
sell to people that aren't

1722
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:11,458
sell-able to.

1723
01:07:11,458 --> 01:07:13,750
You should find every person
that believes in e-comm

1724
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:15,291
instead of convincing people.

1725
01:07:15,291 --> 01:07:16,917
Do you know how many people
believe in e-comm that you

1726
01:07:16,917 --> 01:07:18,000
haven't talked to yet?

1727
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
All of them.
- [Man 7] Gazillion.

1728
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:20,875
- All of them.

1729
01:07:20,875 --> 01:07:23,083
To spend one minute on
trying to convince somebody

1730
01:07:23,083 --> 01:07:26,000
that believes in something
else, e-comm is not smart.

1731
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,500
It's bad strategy.

1732
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:34,417
- [Man 10] Text messaging,
so we're here, this is the

1733
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:38,083
ultimate, access is the
ultimate thing, right?

1734
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,667
The explosion of messaging apps.

1735
01:07:41,667 --> 01:07:46,166
WhatsApp, Messages,
Snapchat, all that stuff.

1736
01:07:46,959 --> 01:07:51,917
How can you leverage
that without sacrificing

1737
01:07:51,917 --> 01:07:53,583
your sanity and all your time?

1738
01:07:53,583 --> 01:07:55,083
Do you even think about that?

1739
01:07:55,083 --> 01:07:56,583
- What do you mean?

1740
01:07:56,583 --> 01:08:00,750
- [Man 10] So, there's a guy
right now, he started a,

1741
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,250
I don't see anybody doing
anything like this at all,

1742
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:06,375
he started, rather than
doing a Facebook group,

1743
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:08,333
he says I'm gonna
do a Facebook chat.

1744
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:11,166
It's annoying because I'm
always getting notifications

1745
01:08:11,166 --> 01:08:12,291
popping up, but I see.

1746
01:08:12,291 --> 01:08:13,834
- Let's stop there.
- [Man 10] Yeah.

1747
01:08:13,834 --> 01:08:16,250
- That's gonna play itself out.

1748
01:08:18,207 --> 01:08:20,582
- [Man 10] His thing is
gonna play itself out?

1749
01:08:20,582 --> 01:08:22,582
- For you, because the
first word out of your mouth

1750
01:08:22,582 --> 01:08:24,250
is it's annoying.

1751
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:26,291
So you're valuing it
as a marketer because

1752
01:08:26,291 --> 01:08:30,166
you're seeing it a lot, but
seeing it and consuming it,

1753
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:32,834
seeing it, consuming it, and
acting on it are two very

1754
01:08:32,834 --> 01:08:33,959
different things.

1755
01:08:33,959 --> 01:08:35,000
- [Man 10] So let me set it up.
- Go ahead.

1756
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,041
- I get energized by my
students contacting me and

1757
01:08:39,041 --> 01:08:40,625
just like you get energized

1758
01:08:40,625 --> 01:08:44,041
and telling me, "Man I did
what you said and it worked."

1759
01:08:44,041 --> 01:08:47,041
- I mean, you guys remember,
for a few minutes tested

1760
01:08:47,041 --> 01:08:50,542
V-chat, fake little app,
go ahead.

1761
01:08:50,542 --> 01:08:52,582
- [Man 10] I get energized
by that kind of stuff,

1762
01:08:52,582 --> 01:08:53,875
but I cannot scale that.

1763
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:57,000
I've got 30 students
now right, but when I've

1764
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,082
got 300 there's no way
that I can make that happen

1765
01:08:59,082 --> 01:09:00,959
unless I have them
pay for that access

1766
01:09:00,959 --> 01:09:04,500
so that's one avenue,
but is there a...

1767
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,375
- You're looking for a
scalable version, what are you

1768
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:07,917
going to sell your message
app that can answer

1769
01:09:07,917 --> 01:09:09,166
the questions for $19.99?

1770
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:13,526
- [Man 10] No I'm looking to 
charge myself up, but I don't

1771
01:09:13,526 --> 01:09:17,439
know how to do, and messaging 
is an amazing way to.

1772
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,856
- Give them your cell number.

1773
01:09:23,636 --> 01:09:26,780
(group laughter)

1774
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:32,960
- [Man 10] I just think that 
text messaging is so huge,

1775
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:37,292
but I don't see anybody
effectively scaling it.

1776
01:09:37,292 --> 01:09:39,984
- Okay.

1777
01:09:39,984 --> 01:09:41,943
- I got to think about
this a little bit more.

1778
01:09:41,943 --> 01:09:44,609
- Let's stay on it for a minute.

1779
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:51,227
Either you don't, you're not
telling me the full story

1780
01:09:51,227 --> 01:09:54,143
and it's not just about
getting charged up, which is

1781
01:09:54,143 --> 01:09:58,850
what I think, or you are

1782
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:00,640
a person that needs to see

1783
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,399
somebody else do something
to give you belief in it.

1784
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:05,482
Both are bad.

1785
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:08,779
So which one is it?

1786
01:10:08,779 --> 01:10:10,338
- [Man 10] There's probably 
a little bit of truth

1787
01:10:10,338 --> 01:10:12,880
in the second one.
- Good, good, that's fine.

1788
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:16,283
And by the way there's nothing
wrong with fast following.

1789
01:10:16,283 --> 01:10:17,283
- [Man 10] Yeah.

1790
01:10:17,283 --> 01:10:18,575
- It's not as good as
being the first one,

1791
01:10:18,575 --> 01:10:19,448
but it's super fine.

1792
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:20,698
And if you're better
at it, it's even better

1793
01:10:20,698 --> 01:10:22,438
so go ahead.

1794
01:10:22,438 --> 01:10:26,683
- [Man 10] But I truly,

1795
01:10:26,683 --> 01:10:30,349
I feel like my purpose
outside of being a father--

1796
01:10:30,349 --> 01:10:31,182
- Yes.

1797
01:10:32,702 --> 01:10:35,702
- [Man 10] is not necessarily 
fulfilled, but I feel like

1798
01:10:35,702 --> 01:10:37,785
I'm getting closer to
realizing my purpose.

1799
01:10:37,785 --> 01:10:38,993
- Which is?

1800
01:10:38,993 --> 01:10:41,702
- [Man 10] To help people get
unstuck from stupid things

1801
01:10:41,702 --> 01:10:43,285
that prevent them from doing.

1802
01:10:43,285 --> 01:10:44,452
- So let me ask you a question.

1803
01:10:44,452 --> 01:10:47,660
If that's your purpose
my friend, why don't you

1804
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,535
do it for free like I do it?

1805
01:10:49,535 --> 01:10:51,702
Since it's my purpose too.

1806
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:57,086
Purpose?

1807
01:10:58,812 --> 01:11:01,020
It's your purpose.

1808
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:04,103
If it's free you'll 
have more people.

1809
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:07,786
Now show me in your actions
that it's actually your purpose.

1810
01:11:07,786 --> 01:11:09,777
- [Man 10] Yeah.

1811
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,655
Yeah, that's good.

1812
01:11:14,655 --> 01:11:17,432
- Cause it's the truth.

1813
01:11:17,432 --> 01:11:20,035
Your purpose doesn't 
come with an asterisk

1814
01:11:20,035 --> 01:11:23,273
attached for 4.99 a month.

1815
01:11:23,273 --> 01:11:24,382
Not your purpose.

1816
01:11:24,382 --> 01:11:26,174
Your business does.
- [Man 10] Yeah.

1817
01:11:26,174 --> 01:11:28,090
- But please don't bullshit
me the difference between

1818
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:31,257
your business and your purpose.

1819
01:11:31,257 --> 01:11:32,529
You know how much I could
charge for what we're doing

1820
01:11:32,529 --> 01:11:33,716
here right now?

1821
01:11:33,716 --> 01:11:36,382
A lot more than
the fucking three, four.

1822
01:11:39,932 --> 01:11:41,008
- [Man 10] Yeah.

1823
01:11:41,008 --> 01:11:42,925
- Is it your purpose?

1824
01:11:42,925 --> 01:11:46,300
'Cause if it is do it for
free and give everybody

1825
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,935
your fucking cell phone number.

1826
01:11:52,363 --> 01:11:53,863
That's the the
realest shit man,

1827
01:11:53,863 --> 01:11:55,239
you know what I mean?

1828
01:11:55,239 --> 01:11:56,114
- [Man 10] Yeah.

1829
01:11:56,114 --> 01:11:59,030
- And by the way, it doesn't
have to be your purpose.

1830
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:00,446
You're not Mother Teresa.

1831
01:12:00,446 --> 01:12:02,822
Actually every time
I say that people get mad,

1832
01:12:02,822 --> 01:12:04,114
I guess she has
a lot of controversy

1833
01:12:04,114 --> 01:12:05,321
so I gotta find
somebody else, but

1834
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:06,155
(group laughter)

1835
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,155
but you know what I mean?
- [Man 10] Yeah.

1836
01:12:07,155 --> 01:12:09,363
Back to judging,
you don't have to but

1837
01:12:09,363 --> 01:12:12,114
you can have that conversation
with a lot of people,

1838
01:12:12,114 --> 01:12:14,613
I'm the worst guy to have
that conversation with.

1839
01:12:14,613 --> 01:12:15,988
On Earth.

1840
01:12:15,988 --> 01:12:18,321
'Cause I have the
most ability to charge

1841
01:12:18,321 --> 01:12:21,030
and I'm the only one
doing it for free at scale.

1842
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:25,738
So you just walked into the
wrong guy for that conversation.

1843
01:12:25,738 --> 01:12:26,863
- [Man 10] Don't you
get annoyed with

1844
01:12:26,863 --> 01:12:28,655
the yahoos who
try to get your attention

1845
01:12:28,655 --> 01:12:30,321
who aren't willing
to do jack squat?

1846
01:12:30,321 --> 01:12:31,655
- I don't even know what
you're talking about,

1847
01:12:31,655 --> 01:12:33,530
that's how little
I pay attention.

1848
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:37,155
(laughs)
I don't even know, you know.

1849
01:12:37,155 --> 01:12:39,325
I get worried 'cause
I know that that's happening

1850
01:12:39,325 --> 01:12:40,655
and a lot of
people are falling for it,

1851
01:12:40,655 --> 01:12:42,488
I get mad when people say to me

1852
01:12:42,488 --> 01:12:44,155
"Gary give me tactics."

1853
01:12:44,155 --> 01:12:45,947
I'm giving it to
them and then they're

1854
01:12:45,947 --> 01:12:47,697
getting it for free from
me and then paying somebody

1855
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:52,072
$4.99 for their Snapchat
book, and all that guy did

1856
01:12:52,072 --> 01:12:56,780
was literally rip my
content and put into a PDF.

1857
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:59,988
I get mad at
people's fucking stupidity.

1858
01:12:59,988 --> 01:13:01,446
And that's why
I'm gonna systematically

1859
01:13:01,446 --> 01:13:02,988
go one by one on
those fucking hucksters

1860
01:13:02,988 --> 01:13:03,988
and put 'em out of business

1861
01:13:03,988 --> 01:13:05,405
(group laughter)

1862
01:13:05,405 --> 01:13:07,155
over a 50-year period,

1863
01:13:07,155 --> 01:13:11,863
buy building the biggest
fucking empire on honey

1864
01:13:11,863 --> 01:13:13,280
to inspire other people,
be like,

1865
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,780
wait a minute,
you can do that?

1866
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:18,947
Yes, you can do that,
you can do it

1867
01:13:18,947 --> 01:13:22,956
by fulfilling your
purpose and then

1868
01:13:22,956 --> 01:13:24,872
selling something else.

1869
01:13:27,718 --> 01:13:29,426
That's just different

1870
01:13:29,426 --> 01:13:31,468
from everybody else.

1871
01:13:31,468 --> 01:13:33,135
It just is.

1872
01:13:33,135 --> 01:13:34,968
How are you my friend?

1873
01:13:39,768 --> 01:13:40,935
The second one's interesting
when you said

1874
01:13:40,935 --> 01:13:43,852
do I share the
P&amp;L with them?

1875
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:45,185
- [Man 17] What are the
goals for the business

1876
01:13:45,185 --> 01:13:46,327
and how much do
you share it with them,

1877
01:13:46,327 --> 01:13:48,826
how do they know that they're 
being treated appropriately?

1878
01:13:48,826 --> 01:13:50,077
I'm going through
this with my business

1879
01:13:50,077 --> 01:13:54,868
- Yeah, got it, that's an
interesting question, man.

1880
01:13:55,508 --> 01:13:58,457
So this is where,
it's very hard bro,

1881
01:13:58,457 --> 01:14:00,498
this is where you go
into the empire part.

1882
01:14:00,498 --> 01:14:02,790
I don't think I need
to open the books,

1883
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:06,498
I'm comfortable with opening
them if I felt like I had to.

1884
01:14:06,498 --> 01:14:10,623
I don't trust the ability for
800 people to interpret it.

1885
01:14:10,623 --> 01:14:12,498
I feel great about it
because I don't know,

1886
01:14:12,498 --> 01:14:14,081
it's gotten better
for everybody,

1887
01:14:14,081 --> 01:14:15,790
and we're gonna make less
money as a company this year,

1888
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:19,707
so it'd be a good time for
me to share it, you know.

1889
01:14:19,707 --> 01:14:22,040
Appropriate is
a one-person game,

1890
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,915
if don't know if DRock
feels like he's being

1891
01:14:23,915 --> 01:14:25,995
appropriately taken care of,

1892
01:14:25,995 --> 01:14:27,828
but I try to have
that conversation,

1893
01:14:27,828 --> 01:14:29,253
I try to be the
kind of person that

1894
01:14:29,253 --> 01:14:31,712
you can have
that conversation with.

1895
01:14:32,682 --> 01:14:33,889
I mean there's a lot of people,

1896
01:14:33,889 --> 01:14:35,137
I've had a couple
of them this week

1897
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:37,886
that I viscerally disagree with.

1898
01:14:37,886 --> 01:14:39,761
I feel like they're
over-compensated,

1899
01:14:39,761 --> 01:14:41,928
they feel like they're
under-compensated.

1900
01:14:41,928 --> 01:14:43,178
The good news in this scenario

1901
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:46,428
is I'm the judge and
the jury, as they are,

1902
01:14:46,428 --> 01:14:50,594
they're more than welcome
to go out to the universe.

1903
01:14:52,556 --> 01:14:55,663
- [Man 17] How often are
you auditing your goals?

1904
01:14:55,663 --> 01:14:59,788
- I only have one goal,
stay in business,

1905
01:14:59,788 --> 01:15:01,832
and build the
capabilities to deploy

1906
01:15:01,832 --> 01:15:04,248
against the future behaviors.

1907
01:15:06,341 --> 01:15:08,009
Really.

1908
01:15:08,009 --> 01:15:08,957
I mean I dunno what else to say,

1909
01:15:08,957 --> 01:15:10,915
we literally flat out
made less money this year

1910
01:15:10,915 --> 01:15:13,373
at a hundred than
we did last year at 67.

1911
01:15:13,373 --> 01:15:14,623
For a lot of
people in this room,

1912
01:15:14,623 --> 01:15:15,832
especially based
on your questions,

1913
01:15:15,832 --> 01:15:17,456
that would be disastrous.

1914
01:15:17,456 --> 01:15:19,540
For me that's phenomenal.

1915
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:22,952
- [Woman 2] You're just
investing in people?

1916
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:25,409
- Yeah, just investing.

1917
01:15:25,409 --> 01:15:27,701
But you're asking a more
interesting question,

1918
01:15:27,701 --> 01:15:29,660
which is, whoever
you're worried about,

1919
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:31,243
that disagrees with you,

1920
01:15:31,243 --> 01:15:33,952
that they're not
getting comp'd properly,

1921
01:15:33,952 --> 01:15:36,701
make a decision if you're
willing to reach those goals.

1922
01:15:36,701 --> 01:15:38,451
- [Man 17] It probably
has more to do with,

1923
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:40,785
you know I am a follower mostly

1924
01:15:40,785 --> 01:15:42,326
for the business
sense that you bring.

1925
01:15:42,326 --> 01:15:43,159
- Yeah.

1926
01:15:43,159 --> 01:15:44,243
- [Man17] I love what
you talk about

1927
01:15:44,243 --> 01:15:47,411
employees, love what 
you did at Wine Library

1928
01:15:47,411 --> 01:15:48,481
it means a lot

1929
01:15:48,481 --> 01:15:50,706
but for me as a business owner,
a new business owner

1930
01:15:50,706 --> 01:15:53,289
that you invest in these people.
- Yeah, yeah.

1931
01:15:53,289 --> 01:15:55,123
- [Man 17] More than
you invest in yourself--

1932
01:15:55,123 --> 01:15:56,790
- That's how you
invest in yourself

1933
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:58,498
- [Man 17] Right, I think of it
as an investment in myself--

1934
01:15:58,498 --> 01:15:59,331
- Of course,

1935
01:15:59,331 --> 01:16:02,039
but sometimes
you can't afford stuff.

1936
01:16:02,039 --> 01:16:03,081
- [Man 17] Sure.

1937
01:16:03,081 --> 01:16:07,456
- Like if I gave everything
everybody wanted here,

1938
01:16:07,456 --> 01:16:09,373
we'd close tomorrow.

1939
01:16:09,373 --> 01:16:11,832
- [Man 17] But I think
being transparent,

1940
01:16:11,832 --> 01:16:13,581
sometimes gives
them some perspective

1941
01:16:13,581 --> 01:16:15,081
on how much I'm putting into it--

1942
01:16:15,081 --> 01:16:16,730
- Show 'em.

1943
01:16:17,597 --> 01:16:18,611
- [Man 17] That's why I asked.

1944
01:16:18,611 --> 01:16:19,528
- Show 'em.

1945
01:16:20,613 --> 01:16:22,405
I don't think
people get it, though.

1946
01:16:22,405 --> 01:16:24,321
Like the biggest reason
I probably would never

1947
01:16:24,321 --> 01:16:26,905
share my books at scale,

1948
01:16:26,905 --> 01:16:29,363
is because if I decided
that in three years

1949
01:16:29,363 --> 01:16:32,071
to make 17 million,
I don't think my employee

1950
01:16:32,071 --> 01:16:35,405
that makes $140,000
understands the difference

1951
01:16:35,405 --> 01:16:37,600
between them and me.

1952
01:16:38,518 --> 01:16:41,101
- [Man 17] I didn't until
I was in business--

1953
01:16:41,101 --> 01:16:42,894
- You got it.

1954
01:16:42,894 --> 01:16:44,977
There's not an employee on Earth

1955
01:16:44,977 --> 01:16:46,560
that knows what it feels like.

1956
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,393
That was such
a cool quote, that whole

1957
01:16:48,393 --> 01:16:49,810
sign the front of the check

1958
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:50,935
versus the back of the check,

1959
01:16:50,935 --> 01:16:52,977
that was super gangster,
I like that.

1960
01:16:52,977 --> 01:16:55,435
Like, the don't know,
and by the way

1961
01:16:55,435 --> 01:16:57,226
they shouldn't know.

1962
01:16:57,226 --> 01:17:00,974
You don't know, until you do it.

1963
01:17:00,974 --> 01:17:03,706
You could dream about what your
first kiss is gonna be like,

1964
01:17:03,706 --> 01:17:08,456
you just don't know what
it is until you have it.

1965
01:17:08,456 --> 01:17:10,289
I figured out how to be a parent

1966
01:17:10,289 --> 01:17:11,841
because I was
11 years older than AJ,

1967
01:17:11,841 --> 01:17:13,341
and when I was
18 and he was seven,

1968
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:16,049
I was really his parent, my ass.

1969
01:17:16,049 --> 01:17:17,508
I fucking walked into
Micha's fucking room

1970
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:18,800
every day the first six months

1971
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,383
just hoping she was still
breathing, you know.

1972
01:17:22,383 --> 01:17:23,216
- [Man 17] Yeah.

1973
01:17:23,216 --> 01:17:24,049
- You don't know.

1974
01:17:24,049 --> 01:17:25,591
And what you
don't know for sure,

1975
01:17:25,591 --> 01:17:27,883
is I thought, well after
they're seven I'll feel better.

1976
01:17:27,883 --> 01:17:30,216
I'm gonna be scared forever.

1977
01:17:32,251 --> 01:17:33,877
- [Man 17] Are you
scared for your business?

1978
01:17:33,877 --> 01:17:36,627
- I'm never scared in business.

1979
01:17:36,627 --> 01:17:38,627
Ever. Never have been,
never will be.

1980
01:17:38,627 --> 01:17:40,293
It's the thing I do.

1981
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:46,792
I genuinely believe that
I'm LeBron and Beyonce,

1982
01:17:46,792 --> 01:17:49,291
I genuinely believe that.

1983
01:17:49,291 --> 01:17:50,875
- [Woman 2] What does scare you?

1984
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:55,083
Health and wellness of
my family, nothing else.

1985
01:17:55,083 --> 01:17:56,667
Just I mean, what else?

1986
01:17:56,667 --> 01:17:57,542
Like what else?

1987
01:17:57,542 --> 01:18:00,417
And I've gotten
weirdly better at this,

1988
01:18:00,417 --> 01:18:02,417
I used to be really
scared of dying,

1989
01:18:02,417 --> 01:18:04,208
I brought up tonight
that I wanted to

1990
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:05,542
live long enough
to see it through

1991
01:18:05,542 --> 01:18:08,375
but I'm less scared of dying,

1992
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:10,542
which I don't really fully
understand yet.

1993
01:18:10,542 --> 01:18:13,018
Might just be, I guess
that's what happens, right?

1994
01:18:13,018 --> 01:18:14,601
It's the first time
in my life I'm like,

1995
01:18:14,601 --> 01:18:17,727
oh, that's why 87-year-old Rick

1996
01:18:17,727 --> 01:18:20,808
is like, "Meh." I get it,
that's kinda cool,

1997
01:18:20,808 --> 01:18:21,868
and different and interesting,

1998
01:18:21,868 --> 01:18:24,202
but trends are changing
and I want to be 120

1999
01:18:24,202 --> 01:18:25,655
and you know.

2000
01:18:28,072 --> 01:18:31,239
I mean, you want them
to have empathy for you,

2001
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:32,239
and what you're dealing with--

2002
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:33,613
- [Man 17] I want 
them to know that--

2003
01:18:33,613 --> 01:18:37,655
- You want them to
have empathy for you.

2004
01:18:37,655 --> 01:18:39,530
As you should,
you know what I mean.

2005
01:18:39,530 --> 01:18:40,540
You want them to have compassion

2006
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:44,707
for what you're dealing with, 
you want them to know.

2007
01:18:44,707 --> 01:18:47,063
- [Man 17] I want them to
know I'm telling them the truth.

2008
01:18:47,063 --> 01:18:47,715
- I know.

2009
01:18:47,715 --> 01:18:49,563
- [Man 17] I'm investing
in the business and them.

2010
01:18:49,563 --> 01:18:51,109
- I know.

2011
01:18:51,109 --> 01:18:54,276
You remember being the
kid and not the parent?

2012
01:18:54,276 --> 01:18:55,693
Remember being a kid?
- [Man 17] Sure.

2013
01:18:55,693 --> 01:18:57,360
- You can only get so far.

2014
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:01,485
You're only going to believe
your parents so much.

2015
01:19:02,585 --> 01:19:05,626
'Cause boy,
I'll get to you my man,

2016
01:19:05,626 --> 01:19:08,293
when you show them the books,

2017
01:19:08,293 --> 01:19:11,293
and then you find out that
Kristen whispered to Tyler

2018
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:15,459
that you fudged the numbers,
your heart will break.

2019
01:19:16,945 --> 01:19:19,528
Do you know that
they don't believe me?

2020
01:19:19,528 --> 01:19:21,112
Do you understand?

2021
01:19:21,112 --> 01:19:23,028
Even in the best
agency you've ever seen?

2022
01:19:23,028 --> 01:19:24,445
They don't believe me.

2023
01:19:24,445 --> 01:19:28,320
They wait for every
moment to not believe me.

2024
01:19:30,279 --> 01:19:33,070
No, I think 'cause
they're jaded.

2025
01:19:36,241 --> 01:19:38,783
They don't believe me.
- [Man 11] Because of school?

2026
01:19:38,783 --> 01:19:41,150
- Because of the game.

2027
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:42,525
The kids believe me
a hell of a lot more

2028
01:19:42,525 --> 01:19:43,859
than the 30 and
40 and 50 year-olds

2029
01:19:43,859 --> 01:19:47,067
that have been burned
by 17 other agencies.

2030
01:19:47,067 --> 01:19:49,734
Experience is what fucks you up.

2031
01:19:54,336 --> 01:19:57,004
I just know what you're in for.

2032
01:19:57,004 --> 01:19:58,336
I've been there.

2033
01:20:01,592 --> 01:20:02,842
If you want the good stuff,

2034
01:20:02,842 --> 01:20:05,300
it comes with
a lot of bad stuff.

2035
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:06,216
- [Man 17] I love it all.

2036
01:20:06,216 --> 01:20:09,341
- Me too.

2037
01:20:09,341 --> 01:20:10,925
- [Man 17] It's happening
pretty soon,

2038
01:20:10,925 --> 01:20:13,280
and we're going
through a few things,

2039
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,678
and I'm just curious how
much to share with them.

2040
01:20:15,678 --> 01:20:18,090
- That isn't the punchline.

2041
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:19,674
The punchline is,
are you giving them

2042
01:20:19,674 --> 01:20:23,548
what they want,
on a one to one basis?

2043
01:20:23,548 --> 01:20:25,215
By the way, a lot
of times it isn't money.

2044
01:20:25,215 --> 01:20:26,215
- [Man 17] No, I know that.

2045
01:20:26,215 --> 01:20:27,048
- Good.

2046
01:20:27,048 --> 01:20:28,173
- [Man 17] It's responsibility.

2047
01:20:28,173 --> 01:20:30,548
- Whatever it may be,
whatever it may be.

2048
01:20:30,548 --> 01:20:35,471
Tickets to a baseball game, a
vacation, an acknowledgement,

2049
01:20:35,471 --> 01:20:38,803
there's just a billion
different variables.

2050
01:20:38,803 --> 01:20:42,553
Spend a lot more time
worrying about Susan and Rick

2051
01:20:42,553 --> 01:20:45,386
and less about the thesis behind
what you're thinking about.

2052
01:20:45,386 --> 01:20:47,344
And it will work itself out.

2053
01:20:47,344 --> 01:20:48,344
See where I'm goin'?

2054
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:50,219
That's the winner.

2055
01:20:50,219 --> 01:20:51,177
How many employees you got?

2056
01:20:51,177 --> 01:20:52,511
- [Man 17] Five.

2057
01:20:52,511 --> 01:20:53,678
- How often have
you gone to dinner

2058
01:20:53,678 --> 01:20:55,219
one by one with the five?

2059
01:20:55,219 --> 01:20:56,136
- [Man 17] Not yet.

2060
01:20:56,136 --> 01:20:57,689
- That's insane.
- [Man 17] Yeah.

2061
01:20:58,819 --> 01:21:02,444
That's the answer, that's
where your problem is.

2062
01:21:02,444 --> 01:21:03,902
Five, I wish.

2063
01:21:03,902 --> 01:21:05,902
(group laughter)

2064
01:21:05,902 --> 01:21:08,256
Good, you know
how you get to 500?

2065
01:21:08,256 --> 01:21:11,048
By taking your five to
dinner every fuckin' day.

2066
01:21:11,048 --> 01:21:14,256
Really, you should really
go to dinner one by one,

2067
01:21:14,256 --> 01:21:16,465
you and Rick,
and you should go to dinner

2068
01:21:16,465 --> 01:21:18,840
once every four to six months.

2069
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,340
And it should start with
like, tell me the truth.

2070
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:23,256
I'm at a constant battle here,

2071
01:21:23,256 --> 01:21:26,423
to get them to believe me
that I want to hear it.

2072
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:30,673
I'm not scared of anything
they're gonna say.

2073
01:21:30,673 --> 01:21:32,048
What the fuck
are they gonna say?

2074
01:21:32,048 --> 01:21:32,924
That I'm wrong?

2075
01:21:32,924 --> 01:21:35,465
I'm like good, you go build it.

2076
01:21:38,748 --> 01:21:39,963
That I don't get it?

2077
01:21:39,963 --> 01:21:43,724
I'm like,
I promise you I get it.

2078
01:21:43,724 --> 01:21:45,307
'Cause here's what I know.

2079
01:21:45,307 --> 01:21:49,474
The ones that have left, they
want to come back real bad.

2080
01:21:53,314 --> 01:21:55,064
That's the punchline.

2081
01:21:56,504 --> 01:21:58,879
You can't wonder
what they think.

2082
01:21:58,879 --> 01:22:01,546
You have to know
what they think.

2083
01:22:01,546 --> 01:22:03,007
The problem is, a lot of
times you don't want to know

2084
01:22:03,007 --> 01:22:04,454
what they think.

2085
01:22:04,454 --> 01:22:08,621
Whether you know it
consciously or subconsciously.

2086
01:22:14,862 --> 01:22:16,995
- [Alex] Ireland.
- Ireland.

2087
01:22:16,995 --> 01:22:18,193
What's your name, my friend?

2088
01:22:18,193 --> 01:22:19,027
- [Evan] Evan.

2089
01:22:19,027 --> 01:22:21,743
- Real pleasure, thanks
for coming in, yeah.

2090
01:22:21,743 --> 01:22:24,217
Are you guys gonna hang out
with each other after I leave?

2091
01:22:24,217 --> 01:22:25,217
- [Woman 4] I think we should.

2092
01:22:25,217 --> 01:22:26,843
- I think people should.

2093
01:22:26,843 --> 01:22:29,176
By the way, I recommend
like smaller groups.

2094
01:22:29,176 --> 01:22:31,551
If you try to boil the
ocean it won't be as good.

2095
01:22:31,551 --> 01:22:33,236
- [Evan] I'm in the
health and fitness industry,

2096
01:22:33,236 --> 01:22:36,493
and we have nine different
Facebook pages.

2097
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:37,326
- Okay.

2098
01:22:37,326 --> 01:22:38,676
- [Evan] And across 
the nine pages

2099
01:22:38,676 --> 01:22:39,979
we've got 
12 million followers.

2100
01:22:39,979 --> 01:22:40,771
- [Gary] Okay.

2101
01:22:40,771 --> 01:22:41,854
- And we're sending 500,000

2102
01:22:41,854 --> 01:22:45,104
clicks a day to 
fitness articles.

2103
01:22:45,104 --> 01:22:47,896
But I kind of want to set
up a personal brand as well.

2104
01:22:47,896 --> 01:22:49,896
What would be the first
step you would take?

2105
01:22:49,896 --> 01:22:50,729
- What are you on?

2106
01:22:50,729 --> 01:22:51,813
- [Evan] I have
zero personal brand.

2107
01:22:51,813 --> 01:22:52,687
- You have zero personal brand?
- [Evan] Yeah.

2108
01:22:52,687 --> 01:22:54,687
- And you want to build 
your personal brand?

2109
01:22:54,687 --> 01:22:55,521
- [Evan] Yeah.

2110
01:22:55,521 --> 01:22:58,604
- And what do you
want to talk about?

2111
01:22:58,604 --> 01:22:59,562
- [Evan] I'm not
really sure yet,

2112
01:22:59,562 --> 01:23:00,792
I need some work here on that.

2113
01:23:00,792 --> 01:23:03,209
- You better figure
that out, you know?

2114
01:23:03,209 --> 01:23:05,501
And I don't mean
like tactically.

2115
01:23:05,501 --> 01:23:08,959
Especially from a guy who is
behind a tactic based business.

2116
01:23:08,959 --> 01:23:12,734
You need to think higher up
what you want to talk about,

2117
01:23:12,734 --> 01:23:15,359
then talk about it, and then
use the distribution channels

2118
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:16,442
to bring awareness to it.

2119
01:23:16,442 --> 01:23:18,109
- [Evan] Yeah.

2120
01:23:18,109 --> 01:23:20,810
- Don't forget,
I was the wine guy.

2121
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:22,477
And then I started talking
about business content

2122
01:23:22,477 --> 01:23:24,352
and nobody wanted me to.

2123
01:23:24,352 --> 01:23:26,734
They said stick to
wine, wine guy.

2124
01:23:26,734 --> 01:23:28,559
Right, got it?

2125
01:23:28,559 --> 01:23:33,516
So you could talk
about flying kites.

2126
01:23:33,516 --> 01:23:38,281
I would still use your scaled
reach of the other channels

2127
01:23:38,281 --> 01:23:41,538
because some people are
into fitness and kites.

2128
01:23:41,538 --> 01:23:42,872
- [Evan] Yeah.

2129
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:46,670
But would you start by
setting up a personal website

2130
01:23:46,670 --> 01:23:48,045
or would your
start with social media,

2131
01:23:48,045 --> 01:23:49,045
like set up an Instagram--

2132
01:23:49,045 --> 01:23:50,483
- Both.

2133
01:23:50,483 --> 01:23:51,817
- [Evan] Both.

2134
01:23:54,767 --> 01:23:56,508
- All of it.

2135
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:01,276
- [Man 19] Thank you for Crush 
It! and for all your stuff.

2136
01:24:01,276 --> 01:24:02,715
It's changed my life literally.

2137
01:24:02,715 --> 01:24:03,548
It's awesome.

2138
01:24:03,548 --> 01:24:04,757
- [Gary] Did Crush It!
change your life?

2139
01:24:04,757 --> 01:24:07,131
By the way, that's the punchline
while I've got all of you.

2140
01:24:07,131 --> 01:24:10,757
The book that I'm writing
next is called Crushed It.

2141
01:24:10,757 --> 01:24:15,173
And the subtitle is how
these 44, 17, 92 people

2142
01:24:15,173 --> 01:24:18,465
read Crush It! and crushed
it, and how you can too.

2143
01:24:18,465 --> 01:24:20,695
So anybody here
who has, not embellish,

2144
01:24:20,695 --> 01:24:22,320
don't do me any favors
'cause it will hurt me

2145
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,438
if you're full of shit, and
we're gonna spend real time

2146
01:24:24,438 --> 01:24:25,772
trying to figure out
if you're full of shit

2147
01:24:25,772 --> 01:24:28,146
and if you told me that
Crush It! changed your business

2148
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:30,271
and it didn't, then I'm really

2149
01:24:30,271 --> 01:24:31,938
never gonna talk to you again.

2150
01:24:31,938 --> 01:24:35,021
But if you were affected by
Crush It! with tangible results,

2151
01:24:35,021 --> 01:24:37,188
I wanna get those stories.

2152
01:24:37,188 --> 01:24:38,480
Please email me.

2153
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,313
- [Man 17] I will.

2154
01:24:39,313 --> 01:24:40,146
- [Gary] Actually, email Alex.

2155
01:24:40,146 --> 01:24:42,480
(group laughter)

2156
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:45,438
- It was good timing,
I read it in like 2011, 2012,

2157
01:24:45,438 --> 01:24:47,772
I created this product
out of my family business.

2158
01:24:47,772 --> 01:24:50,230
It's called Baking Steel,
it literally changed my life.

2159
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:51,104
- [Gary] That's awesome.

2160
01:24:51,104 --> 01:24:53,355
- It's awesome,
I have a blast doing it.

2161
01:24:53,355 --> 01:24:54,896
In my former life 
I was a foodie,

2162
01:24:54,896 --> 01:24:56,306
so I've kind of combined--

2163
01:24:56,306 --> 01:24:57,264
- [Gary] I love it.

2164
01:24:57,264 --> 01:25:01,431
(camera movement 
drowns out speaker)

2165
01:25:03,332 --> 01:25:06,706
- The good news is, I've created
this product for consumers.

2166
01:25:06,706 --> 01:25:09,665
But it's one off, I'm
gonna sell you one and--

2167
01:25:09,665 --> 01:25:10,940
- [Gary] Yeah.

2168
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:13,972
- Right, we have 
a long term problem.

2169
01:25:13,972 --> 01:25:16,398
- [Gary] You either create
an ancillary product

2170
01:25:16,398 --> 01:25:18,856
that figures out how
to make the next step

2171
01:25:18,856 --> 01:25:21,940
or you are happy with being
the George Foreman grill.

2172
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:23,606
- Okay, okay.

2173
01:25:23,606 --> 01:25:26,189
- [Gary] Or you do that and
you create something

2174
01:25:26,189 --> 01:25:28,815
completely different, and get
your creative juices nut off.

2175
01:25:28,815 --> 01:25:31,773
- [Man 19] Okay,
that's kind of what we're doing.

2176
01:25:31,773 --> 01:25:33,481
- [Gary] Yep, all of them work.

2177
01:25:33,481 --> 01:25:36,564
You just have to be good at
any one of those versions.

2178
01:25:36,564 --> 01:25:39,689
And a lot of times people
fail in that second product

2179
01:25:39,689 --> 01:25:42,523
'cause they use too
much of what made

2180
01:25:42,523 --> 01:25:45,272
their first product work
in their second product

2181
01:25:45,272 --> 01:25:48,038
without realizing the
differences in the world

2182
01:25:48,038 --> 01:25:50,731
from one to the other, or
the competitive landscape

2183
01:25:50,731 --> 01:25:51,564
of the new one.

2184
01:25:51,564 --> 01:25:53,046
- [Man 19] Mm-hmm, 
sure, sounds great.

2185
01:25:53,046 --> 01:25:54,189
- [Gary] Good.

2186
01:25:54,189 --> 01:25:55,523
- [Man 19] And the 
content part is awesome.

2187
01:25:55,523 --> 01:25:57,564
I want more of that,
because you can't do enough.

2188
01:25:57,564 --> 01:26:01,815
- [Gary] I know, listen, trust
me, back to ambition and...

2189
01:26:01,815 --> 01:26:05,147
You would not believe how
much I was like fuck man,

2190
01:26:05,147 --> 01:26:06,940
I wish I wanted a five pers--

2191
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:08,523
I think that's awesome.

2192
01:26:08,523 --> 01:26:11,856
I'm not joking,
I'm convinced, convinced.

2193
01:26:11,856 --> 01:26:14,272
This is not even a debate
that I'll be 80 and be like

2194
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:16,064
mm, wish I'd wanted
a little less,

2195
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:16,981
could have done a little more.

2196
01:26:16,981 --> 01:26:18,606
I already do, I do now.

2197
01:26:18,606 --> 01:26:20,398
I don't have to guess.

2198
01:26:22,448 --> 01:26:23,989
This is not a joke,
and you're all gonna be

2199
01:26:23,989 --> 01:26:25,406
like "no, don't."

2200
01:26:26,285 --> 01:26:28,894
If a drug came out to
siphon out ambition DNA,

2201
01:26:28,894 --> 01:26:30,311
I would do it.

2202
01:26:30,311 --> 01:26:33,145
I'm telling you why, because
exact l y where I am now

2203
01:26:33,145 --> 01:26:37,645
I can settle into a four
to $13 million a year life

2204
01:26:37,645 --> 01:26:39,145
being just me.

2205
01:26:39,145 --> 01:26:42,520
Write one book, speak
140 times, and be done.

2206
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:45,687
Still not siphon from
you and be good,

2207
01:26:45,687 --> 01:26:47,437
and fuckin' take
my kids on these trips

2208
01:26:47,437 --> 01:26:49,770
and fuckin' chill and not deal

2209
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:52,603
with the fuckin' fires I'm
dealing with right now.

2210
01:26:52,603 --> 01:26:54,353
I got a lot of 'em.

2211
01:26:54,353 --> 01:26:57,186
I got five offices
and 770 people.

2212
01:26:58,368 --> 01:26:59,583
- [Woman] When are 
you coming to Sydney?

2213
01:26:59,583 --> 01:27:00,427
- I was just there.

2214
01:27:00,427 --> 01:27:01,385
- [Woman] No, I know, 
I was there as well.

2215
01:27:01,385 --> 01:27:04,177
- Oh actually, yes,
I remember now.

2216
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:06,177
Actually, that's so weird, that
clicked for me a little bit.

2217
01:27:06,177 --> 01:27:07,385
That was cool,
I like how the brain works.

2218
01:27:07,385 --> 01:27:09,010
(group laughter)

2219
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:10,205
- No I mean opening offices.

2220
01:27:10,205 --> 01:27:11,288
- [Gary] Oh, office.

2221
01:27:11,288 --> 01:27:14,914
There's gonna be a real battle
between Sydney and Singapore.

2222
01:27:14,914 --> 01:27:17,830
I'm fascinated to see how it
plays out for VaynerMedia.

2223
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:19,594
I used to think
Singapore was gonna win,

2224
01:27:19,594 --> 01:27:20,594
now I think Sydney's gonna win

2225
01:27:20,594 --> 01:27:23,302
'cause I think we'll actually
just go directly into China.

2226
01:27:23,302 --> 01:27:24,926
We're gonna have to,
t here's no other way to win

2227
01:27:24,926 --> 01:27:27,224
in that market.

2228
01:27:28,930 --> 01:27:29,783
- [Woman] Cool.

2229
01:27:29,783 --> 01:27:30,617
- [Gary] Yeah.

2230
01:27:30,617 --> 01:27:32,992
- [Woman] Australia 
I can live with.

2231
01:27:32,992 --> 01:27:34,450
- Yeah, I love,
I love Australia.

2232
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:36,825
I mean that's, that to
me is such an easy market

2233
01:27:36,825 --> 01:27:40,408
because I'm cozy with
it from the wine world.

2234
01:27:40,408 --> 01:27:43,325
- [Woman] Yeah, and it's, it's,
and my world is payroll

2235
01:27:43,325 --> 01:27:45,742
in Australia, and we like.

2236
01:27:45,742 --> 01:27:47,491
Oh, that's terrible that
this is being recorded

2237
01:27:47,491 --> 01:27:48,861
because I was about
to tell you a secret,

2238
01:27:48,861 --> 01:27:51,408
but it's so, my business
is so easy because

2239
01:27:51,408 --> 01:27:55,867
I'm like in a market that's
20 years behind everyone else.

2240
01:27:55,867 --> 01:27:57,325
- By the way, by the way.

2241
01:27:57,325 --> 01:27:59,700
All of the markets.

2242
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:01,241
You didn't say anything crazy.

2243
01:28:01,241 --> 01:28:02,325
Every market.

2244
01:28:02,325 --> 01:28:03,200
- I just thought I was.

2245
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,034
- Nope.

2246
01:28:04,034 --> 01:28:05,658
All of them.

2247
01:28:05,658 --> 01:28:07,533
All the markets.

2248
01:28:07,533 --> 01:28:09,408
That's the crazy part.

2249
01:28:09,408 --> 01:28:13,867
If you actually deploy modern
tactics against any business,

2250
01:28:13,867 --> 01:28:15,408
it will work.

2251
01:28:15,408 --> 01:28:17,159
You got anything?

2252
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:21,241
- Well, everyone kind of had
questions that were good.

2253
01:28:21,241 --> 01:28:23,200
You put out a lot
of content that's good.

2254
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,575
But one thing, back to dads.

2255
01:28:24,575 --> 01:28:26,742
My dad, I turned him on
to your stuff obviously

2256
01:28:26,742 --> 01:28:28,491
when I said I was coming here.

2257
01:28:28,491 --> 01:28:30,783
He always says two
out of 10 people get it

2258
01:28:30,783 --> 01:28:32,241
and the other eight don't.

2259
01:28:32,241 --> 01:28:33,366
Do you believe that?

2260
01:28:33,366 --> 01:28:35,700
- I think the numbers
are way worse.

2261
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:37,575
I think your dad's
an awesome optimist.

2262
01:28:37,575 --> 01:28:39,950
(group laughter)

2263
01:28:39,950 --> 01:28:41,783
You know, I think, I mean, look.

2264
01:28:41,783 --> 01:28:44,075
It goes back
to entrepreneur like

2265
01:28:44,075 --> 01:28:45,325
what's the definition of get it?

2266
01:28:45,325 --> 01:28:48,200
I think you got a good insight,
as much as you know me.

2267
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:51,825
I'm pushing way harder than
you think on the heady shit.

2268
01:28:51,825 --> 01:28:53,908
Like I'm way up there.

2269
01:28:53,908 --> 01:28:55,200
I'm just trying to
stay down here

2270
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,491
because I don't wanna get,
I wanna keep it

2271
01:28:56,491 --> 01:28:59,200
as practical as I can,
but like getting it to me

2272
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:03,408
is literally, my definition,
care about nothing

2273
01:29:03,408 --> 01:29:05,783
except the health of the
people you love the most.

2274
01:29:05,783 --> 01:29:06,617
Zero.

2275
01:29:10,034 --> 01:29:12,617
Super interesting in theory.

2276
01:29:12,617 --> 01:29:15,742
What a wild game to do in
practice, like in real life

2277
01:29:15,742 --> 01:29:18,075
and execute on, you know?

2278
01:29:18,075 --> 01:29:20,826
I can't sustain stress.

2279
01:29:21,138 --> 01:29:22,597
- [Man 6] How do
you execute on that?

2280
01:29:22,597 --> 01:29:24,180
- [Gary] You know I don't.

2281
01:29:25,312 --> 01:29:26,145
Perspective.

2282
01:29:26,785 --> 01:29:29,035
Just dictatorship
around perspective.

2283
01:29:29,035 --> 01:29:31,785
If I had one employee,
if that sounded better,

2284
01:29:31,785 --> 01:29:33,035
and then a trillion.

2285
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:34,118
If I bought the Jets.

2286
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:34,952
I've said this.

2287
01:29:34,952 --> 01:29:35,785
I know some of you've heard it.

2288
01:29:35,785 --> 01:29:38,077
If I bought the Jets tomorrow,

2289
01:29:38,077 --> 01:29:41,327
and I got a text that Xander
got hit by a bus and died,

2290
01:29:41,327 --> 01:29:43,868
the fuck do you
think I'm gonna do?

2291
01:29:43,868 --> 01:29:46,330
Think I'm gonna be pumped about
the Steelers game next week?

2292
01:29:46,330 --> 01:29:48,663
I may never recover.

2293
01:29:48,663 --> 01:29:51,497
The fuck's the
matter with people?

2294
01:29:53,647 --> 01:29:56,064
If all five of your employees
hate you with their guts

2295
01:29:56,064 --> 01:29:57,647
and were gonna leave tomorrow,

2296
01:29:57,647 --> 01:30:00,397
I promise you that's way
better than the person

2297
01:30:00,397 --> 01:30:02,564
you love the most
dying tomorrow.

2298
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:04,606
So I don't know,
understand why one would.

2299
01:30:04,606 --> 01:30:06,856
But we do not act like that.

2300
01:30:06,856 --> 01:30:08,731
We do not act like that.

2301
01:30:08,731 --> 01:30:10,606
We don't act like that.

2302
01:30:10,606 --> 01:30:12,064
We don't act like that.

2303
01:30:12,064 --> 01:30:13,606
And that's it.

2304
01:30:13,606 --> 01:30:15,606
Now, when I put on my jersey,

2305
01:30:15,606 --> 01:30:16,522
which is what
I'm doing right now.

2306
01:30:16,522 --> 01:30:19,148
When I'm in it, I'm in it.

2307
01:30:19,148 --> 01:30:20,647
But it's like
this fucking parallel.

2308
01:30:20,647 --> 01:30:23,397
Like it's like the programs
that run behind the scenes

2309
01:30:23,397 --> 01:30:24,230
on your computer.

2310
01:30:24,230 --> 01:30:26,731
Like there's a parallel
thing that's going on with me

2311
01:30:26,731 --> 01:30:29,606
that's just always
has that in mind.

2312
01:30:29,606 --> 01:30:32,522
It doesn't take away from
me wanting to destroy

2313
01:30:32,522 --> 01:30:34,981
everybody and fucking
deal with everybody

2314
01:30:34,981 --> 01:30:36,647
and do my thing.

2315
01:30:36,647 --> 01:30:38,814
I'm not leaving anything
on the field with you

2316
01:30:38,814 --> 01:30:41,064
in these two hours.

2317
01:30:41,064 --> 01:30:42,480
But it's running.

2318
01:30:44,154 --> 01:30:45,737
You know?

2319
01:30:45,737 --> 01:30:48,154
It's fucking running.

2320
01:30:48,154 --> 01:30:49,611
Emailed, newsletter.

2321
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:52,528
(inaudible talk)

2322
01:30:52,528 --> 01:30:54,070
It was The Hustler Digest?

2323
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:54,903
Yeah.

2324
01:30:54,903 --> 01:30:56,653
- [Man 18] So I'm like okay,
did you go back to automation?

2325
01:30:56,653 --> 01:30:58,237
Did you think that
the audience could ...

2326
01:30:58,237 --> 01:30:59,486
- No, because I don't
think there's anything

2327
01:30:59,486 --> 01:31:01,320
I'm doing in that email
that makes you think

2328
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:03,820
I'm personally
sending you that email.

2329
01:31:03,820 --> 01:31:05,154
Like when you
signed up for it, it said

2330
01:31:05,154 --> 01:31:06,987
it's an email newsletter
that comes out once a week.

2331
01:31:06,987 --> 01:31:09,237
I don't like when people
try to use automation

2332
01:31:09,237 --> 01:31:11,653
to trick you into
thinking it's them.

2333
01:31:11,653 --> 01:31:13,361
I was curious if you were
gonna go down that path.

2334
01:31:13,361 --> 01:31:14,945
You see what I mean?

2335
01:31:14,945 --> 01:31:16,195
I love automation.

2336
01:31:16,195 --> 01:31:21,028
I don't like when automation
is a front for actual.

2337
01:31:21,028 --> 01:31:23,099
And I've done a 
bad job historically

2338
01:31:23,099 --> 01:31:25,269
creating that clarity.

2339
01:31:25,269 --> 01:31:26,393
I hope you got that one, DRock,

2340
01:31:26,393 --> 01:31:27,383
'cause that's needed out there.

2341
01:31:27,383 --> 01:31:28,341
You see what I mean?

2342
01:31:28,341 --> 01:31:29,175
That's all.

2343
01:31:29,175 --> 01:31:30,591
I don't like the
deceptiveness of like,

2344
01:31:30,591 --> 01:31:33,341
oh, when I would say
that story in my keynotes

2345
01:31:33,341 --> 01:31:35,550
about like, then the emails
came out with your name on it.

2346
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:38,134
They were trying to
act like they wrote it.

2347
01:31:38,134 --> 01:31:39,842
See where I'm going?

2348
01:31:39,842 --> 01:31:40,675
- That's all I have.

2349
01:31:40,675 --> 01:31:41,967
I just came to take in the view.

2350
01:31:41,967 --> 01:31:44,050
- Yeah, the view is.

2351
01:31:44,050 --> 01:31:46,550
- [Man 14] I'm curious
because what you just said

2352
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:48,134
and the conversation on scale.

2353
01:31:48,134 --> 01:31:50,217
How many people here have got a,

2354
01:31:50,217 --> 01:31:51,175
any platform?

2355
01:31:51,175 --> 01:31:52,800
Because the attention game is.

2356
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,425
You brought me
many different places.

2357
01:31:54,425 --> 01:31:56,883
How are you doing that a
direct contact from Gary?

2358
01:31:56,883 --> 01:31:58,758
- You mean like a heart on
Instagram and reply the email?

2359
01:31:58,758 --> 01:32:01,383
- [Man 14] Facebook, 
Twitter, Snapchat.

2360
01:32:01,383 --> 01:32:03,675
Thank you, I watched it, TY.

2361
01:32:03,675 --> 01:32:05,300
Get this person contacted.

2362
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:06,134
- Yup.
Yeah.

2363
01:32:06,134 --> 01:32:06,967
I email them.

2364
01:32:06,967 --> 01:32:07,800
- That's what's here.

2365
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,105
I emailed Gary
about this whole thing.

2366
01:32:10,105 --> 01:32:12,382
- [Man 14] I got one
and it was an email.

2367
01:32:12,382 --> 01:32:14,382
My thing, what I think's
scary is we don't do that

2368
01:32:14,382 --> 01:32:15,522
in our businesses.

2369
01:32:15,522 --> 01:32:18,314
Now I run a brick and mortar
for fricking ten years plus.

2370
01:32:18,314 --> 01:32:19,688
- [Gary] I'm the busiest 
of all of you.

2371
01:32:19,688 --> 01:32:22,022
(group laughter)

2372
01:32:22,022 --> 01:32:23,272
- [Man 14] We don't do that
in our own business with

2373
01:32:23,272 --> 01:32:25,480
our five or 50 employees.

2374
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:26,314
- You know what's interesting?

2375
01:32:26,314 --> 01:32:27,147
You know what's
also interesting?

2376
01:32:27,147 --> 01:32:28,605
When I say, "I'm the
busiest of all of you",

2377
01:32:28,605 --> 01:32:30,544
and you made that face because
you're hustling your ass off?

2378
01:32:30,544 --> 01:32:32,377
The punch line isn't that
I'm actually the busiest.

2379
01:32:32,377 --> 01:32:35,961
It's just that I'm busy, so
busy that whether I'm working

2380
01:32:35,961 --> 01:32:37,877
18 hours and three
minutes and you're working

2381
01:32:37,877 --> 01:32:41,000
18 hours and four,
the punchline is

2382
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,250
it can be done.

2383
01:32:43,017 --> 01:32:44,350
- [Man 14] The face was due to

2384
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:48,600
what would happen if he
was around ten years ago?

2385
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:49,892
That's the hustle.

2386
01:32:49,892 --> 01:32:51,059
That's the
difference in the hustle.

2387
01:32:51,059 --> 01:32:51,892
- You know what's crazy?

2388
01:32:51,892 --> 01:32:54,767
I work harder now than
I did ten years ago.

2389
01:32:54,767 --> 01:32:55,600
- [Man 14] Yeah,
but what advice

2390
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,225
would you give
yourself now 10 years,

2391
01:32:57,225 --> 01:32:59,808
like from now and
when you look back.

2392
01:32:59,808 --> 01:33:01,391
'Cause you look back and
you think you work harder

2393
01:33:01,391 --> 01:33:04,293
'cause you're smarter.

2394
01:33:04,293 --> 01:33:05,643
- You think I'm smart?

2395
01:33:05,643 --> 01:33:06,892
- [Man 14] You're
way smarter today

2396
01:33:06,892 --> 01:33:07,839
than you were ten years ago.
- For sure.

2397
01:33:07,839 --> 01:33:10,506
But I'm also working harder too.

2398
01:33:10,506 --> 01:33:11,963
- [Man 14] Wine library videos--
- Yeah.

2399
01:33:11,963 --> 01:33:13,214
- [Man 14] To do my show.
- Yeah.

2400
01:33:13,214 --> 01:33:15,399
- [Man 14] My ass
wasn't getting on video.

2401
01:33:15,399 --> 01:33:17,155
Until I saw that and go.

2402
01:33:17,155 --> 01:33:18,570
- He can do it,
that guy, I can do it.

2403
01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:20,083
(group laughter)
Yeah.

2404
01:33:20,083 --> 01:33:23,402
You know what's crazy is how
much harder I actually, harder.

2405
01:33:23,402 --> 01:33:24,425
And that makes sense.

2406
01:33:24,425 --> 01:33:27,020
That's why it's, it's like
momentum, like it's interesting.

2407
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:28,394
I just think 
it's so interesting.

2408
01:33:28,394 --> 01:33:30,645
Stuff that's tried and true,
I'm fascinated by that.

2409
01:33:30,645 --> 01:33:33,645
But you know, I'm really, thank
you for asking that question

2410
01:33:33,645 --> 01:33:35,228
because I don't know how he
caught it, but if we have

2411
01:33:35,228 --> 01:33:38,062
the right clip to that moment,

2412
01:33:38,062 --> 01:33:40,811
boy, there's a lot of people
that don't even do it once.

2413
01:33:40,811 --> 01:33:42,345
- [Man 14] Right.
- There's people literally.

2414
01:33:42,345 --> 01:33:46,054
Some of you have never
replied to a single comment

2415
01:33:46,054 --> 01:33:48,386
on a social media post that
you've made for your business

2416
01:33:48,386 --> 01:33:51,136
to somebody that replied to it.

2417
01:33:51,136 --> 01:33:52,553
- [Man 6] It takes
five seconds too.

2418
01:33:52,553 --> 01:33:55,012
It's like, why don't 
they do it, you know?

2419
01:33:55,012 --> 01:33:56,012
- [Woman 3] Can I say
you referred to that

2420
01:33:56,012 --> 01:33:57,428
in the BeachBody speech.

2421
01:33:57,428 --> 01:33:58,261
- [Gary] Yes.

2422
01:33:58,261 --> 01:34:00,012
- 'Cause you went to people
and you said, "Hello."

2423
01:34:00,012 --> 01:34:00,845
- [Gary] I did.

2424
01:34:00,845 --> 01:34:02,012
I always do that.

2425
01:34:02,012 --> 01:34:04,303
I always do that
'cause I'm curious.

2426
01:34:04,303 --> 01:34:05,136
People.

2427
01:34:05,136 --> 01:34:06,553
When people leave.

2428
01:34:06,553 --> 01:34:07,845
I'm so weird.

2429
01:34:07,845 --> 01:34:09,678
I don't do a lot
of things I should do,

2430
01:34:09,678 --> 01:34:11,553
and I like I
do different things.

2431
01:34:11,553 --> 01:34:13,428
There's no reason for
somebody to leave a comment

2432
01:34:13,428 --> 01:34:14,887
on my Instagram saying,

2433
01:34:14,887 --> 01:34:17,038
"Learn the hustle from GaryVee."

2434
01:34:17,038 --> 01:34:18,504
And for me to
spend four minutes on that

2435
01:34:18,504 --> 01:34:20,421
in a world where, like
click on that person,

2436
01:34:20,421 --> 01:34:21,254
look at it.

2437
01:34:21,254 --> 01:34:22,130
You know?

2438
01:34:22,130 --> 01:34:24,546
Versus all the things
I should be doing, it's insane.

2439
01:34:24,546 --> 01:34:26,671
But it gives
me context, you know.

2440
01:34:26,671 --> 01:34:31,421
It's so interesting, but
boy, people aren't doing it.

2441
01:34:31,421 --> 01:34:33,629
People love to say it.

2442
01:34:33,629 --> 01:34:35,838
People hate to do it.

2443
01:34:35,838 --> 01:34:37,005
- [Woman] I mean think
about how good you felt

2444
01:34:37,005 --> 01:34:37,838
when you heard from Gary.

2445
01:34:37,838 --> 01:34:39,838
- Oh, the greatest.

2446
01:34:39,838 --> 01:34:41,171
I would shit my pants.

2447
01:34:41,171 --> 01:34:42,171
Listen, I wrote the blog post.

2448
01:34:42,171 --> 01:34:43,462
It's the Ricky Henderson effect.

2449
01:34:43,462 --> 01:34:45,379
That dude fucking winked
and it's been forever.

2450
01:34:45,379 --> 01:34:46,879
Fucking love Ricky.

2451
01:34:46,879 --> 01:34:48,359
A wink.

2452
01:34:49,695 --> 01:34:50,945
It's how I got
Oprah on Instagram.

2453
01:34:50,945 --> 01:34:54,778
Go look at Oprah's first
picture on Instagram.

2454
01:34:54,778 --> 01:34:55,612
It's me.

2455
01:34:55,612 --> 01:34:56,855
Fat me.

2456
01:34:56,855 --> 01:34:58,438
(group laughter)

2457
01:34:58,438 --> 01:34:59,688
I got it because I asked.

2458
01:34:59,688 --> 01:35:00,688
Like she was
trying to get, I was like,

2459
01:35:00,688 --> 01:35:03,314
"Do you ever wink
at anybody on set?"

2460
01:35:03,314 --> 01:35:04,188
She was like,
"What do you mean?"

2461
01:35:04,188 --> 01:35:06,216
I'm like, "Did you
ever wink at anybody

2462
01:35:06,216 --> 01:35:07,842
"while you were in
between commercial break,

2463
01:35:07,842 --> 01:35:08,717
"taping your show?

2464
01:35:08,717 --> 01:35:09,842
"The people in your audience?"

2465
01:35:09,842 --> 01:35:10,675
She goes, "Of course."

2466
01:35:10,675 --> 01:35:11,550
I'm like, "Do you understand
they've been telling

2467
01:35:11,550 --> 01:35:14,823
"that story for
the last 30 years?"

2468
01:35:17,644 --> 01:35:21,727
- So take one hour of whatever
the fuck you're doing,

2469
01:35:21,727 --> 01:35:22,815
and spend it on that,

2470
01:35:22,815 --> 01:35:25,523
over two and three and seven
and nine minutes at a time.

2471
01:35:25,523 --> 01:35:28,065
- [Man 4] Can I give you a
short little story real quick?

2472
01:35:28,065 --> 01:35:28,898
- Sure.

2473
01:35:28,898 --> 01:35:30,440
Where you talk about your mom,

2474
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:31,648
'cause I'm still
trying to win her over.

2475
01:35:31,648 --> 01:35:34,338
- Oh, she's good, she's
starting her own business.

2476
01:35:34,338 --> 01:35:36,434
She's opening a
salon and everything,

2477
01:35:36,434 --> 01:35:39,434
and she loves the school,
and she's totally fine.

2478
01:35:39,434 --> 01:35:40,593
Thank you for your help.

2479
01:35:40,593 --> 01:35:42,281
But anyway,

2480
01:35:42,281 --> 01:35:44,740
so I was listening to Lewis's
podcast the other day.

2481
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:45,823
Lewis Howes.
- Yes.

2482
01:35:45,823 --> 01:35:47,948
- And he had Elizabeth Gilbert.

2483
01:35:47,948 --> 01:35:49,740
- [Gary] I don't know
who she is.

2484
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:50,573
What's that?

2485
01:35:50,573 --> 01:35:52,115
- She wrote like
Eat, Pray, Love.

2486
01:35:52,115 --> 01:35:54,032
- [Gary] Eat, Pray, Love,
yeah, big book, I know that.

2487
01:35:54,032 --> 01:35:56,948
- So she was giving--
- [Gary] I've heard of that.

2488
01:35:56,948 --> 01:35:58,865
- She was talking
about Oprah in it,

2489
01:35:58,865 --> 01:36:01,698
and she says, this is
why I love Oprah so much.

2490
01:36:01,698 --> 01:36:03,907
There was this
big conference she does

2491
01:36:03,907 --> 01:36:06,490
with like 20,000 people
speaking in stadiums,

2492
01:36:06,490 --> 01:36:09,490
and she got
this woman, this little girl

2493
01:36:09,490 --> 01:36:11,490
from Make a Wish Foundation
there, and everyone

2494
01:36:11,490 --> 01:36:13,658
gave her all their attention,
like she should stand up,

2495
01:36:13,658 --> 01:36:14,897
and Oprah said something.

2496
01:36:14,897 --> 01:36:17,813
That wasn't the real thing, it
was Oprah then said you know,

2497
01:36:17,813 --> 01:36:19,605
there's this other
girl that makes me,

2498
01:36:19,605 --> 01:36:22,105
really reminds me of
myself, she loves to read,

2499
01:36:22,105 --> 01:36:24,271
she's so passionate, and
she actually brought out

2500
01:36:24,271 --> 01:36:27,105
the girl's sister, who
doesn't get any attention--

2501
01:36:27,105 --> 01:36:28,980
- [Gary] Of course, yeah.
- Because the Make a Wish

2502
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:31,188
Foundation wanted the girl
who gets all the attention,

2503
01:36:31,188 --> 01:36:32,522
and her parents
are so focused on her.

2504
01:36:32,522 --> 01:36:34,146
- [Gary] Of course, yeah.
- And she made that one girl

2505
01:36:34,146 --> 01:36:35,897
extremely special.
- [Gary] That's really cool.

2506
01:36:35,897 --> 01:36:37,939
- I had no opinions
towards Oprah at all,

2507
01:36:37,939 --> 01:36:39,730
but hearing that story,
I wasn't there,

2508
01:36:39,730 --> 01:36:42,271
I'm sure so many people heard
that, just that little thing

2509
01:36:42,271 --> 01:36:45,480
that she thought to do,
makes all the difference.

2510
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:48,563
- [Gary] Yeah, and I was
super mad at Oprah.

2511
01:36:48,563 --> 01:36:52,362
Because that's easy, that's
the $50,000 donation.

2512
01:36:52,362 --> 01:36:56,630
What's hard is actually replying
to people on social media.

2513
01:36:56,630 --> 01:36:59,255
Everybody's got
different stories.

2514
01:36:59,255 --> 01:37:00,422
It's cool.

2515
01:37:00,422 --> 01:37:03,922
That's why I'm super
careful to judge anything

2516
01:37:03,922 --> 01:37:07,380
unless I really know it,
you know?

2517
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:09,046
Life is interesting.

2518
01:37:11,586 --> 01:37:12,429
Sure is.

2519
01:37:12,429 --> 01:37:13,346
- [Woman 3] I have
one quick question.

2520
01:37:13,346 --> 01:37:14,263
- Please.

2521
01:37:14,263 --> 01:37:15,763
- [Woman 3] The stuff
that you bought on eBay,

2522
01:37:15,763 --> 01:37:16,804
- Yes. (chuckles)

2523
01:37:16,804 --> 01:37:18,554
- [Woman 3] Where 
did you sell that?

2524
01:37:18,554 --> 01:37:20,029
I know on eBay, but--
- I gave it, I gave it

2525
01:37:20,029 --> 01:37:22,180
to my sister to sell.

2526
01:37:24,877 --> 01:37:26,553
Boy, I love that game.

2527
01:37:26,553 --> 01:37:28,002
- [Woman 3] It's fun to watch.

2528
01:37:28,002 --> 01:37:30,251
- It's just, you know, the
level you're playing out

2529
01:37:30,251 --> 01:37:31,668
with commerce
is a little bit different.

2530
01:37:31,668 --> 01:37:33,627
The Snapchat thing,

2531
01:37:33,627 --> 01:37:36,210
guys I'm getting emails from
people that are homeless

2532
01:37:36,210 --> 01:37:37,915
that made a hundred
bucks garage sale-ing.

2533
01:37:37,915 --> 01:37:39,373
It's game-changing.

2534
01:37:39,373 --> 01:37:40,844
Homeless.

2535
01:37:43,467 --> 01:37:46,467
That's actually, by the
way, that is my big little,

2536
01:37:46,467 --> 01:37:47,618
I'm going very micro right now,

2537
01:37:47,618 --> 01:37:49,743
trying to figure out this
homeless people

2538
01:37:49,743 --> 01:37:51,243
have smartphone thing

2539
01:37:51,243 --> 01:37:53,577
that I'm really,
I'm really into it.

2540
01:37:53,577 --> 01:37:56,577
I'm like, there
is something real here.

2541
01:37:56,577 --> 01:37:57,743
I need to figure this out,

2542
01:37:57,743 --> 01:37:59,952
the same way I won
on the Breakfast Club,

2543
01:37:59,952 --> 01:38:01,895
the same way I won 
on like 20-year-olds,

2544
01:38:01,895 --> 01:38:03,065
I'm like, you know,

2545
01:38:03,065 --> 01:38:04,857
I don't want to be that guy,
like "I'm gonna help the..."

2546
01:38:04,857 --> 01:38:08,315
I'm not gonna sell my SaaS 
product, but I'm gonna learn,

2547
01:38:08,315 --> 01:38:11,065
and I'm gonna learn,
and I'm gonna learn.

2548
01:38:11,065 --> 01:38:13,523
There's something really
powerful there.

2549
01:38:13,523 --> 01:38:15,585
It's the most powerful
device in the world

2550
01:38:15,585 --> 01:38:19,440
and so many people that
have the least have it.

2551
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:23,015
Never in a time in life
has that been the case.

2552
01:38:23,015 --> 01:38:25,625
Gotta figure that out,
gotta figure that out.

2553
01:38:25,625 --> 01:38:26,583
I will.

2554
01:38:26,583 --> 01:38:28,563
The eBay thing is real.

2555
01:38:28,563 --> 01:38:30,527
It works on so
many levels for me.

2556
01:38:30,527 --> 01:38:33,318
DRock and I are gonna
do a full-pledged, all-in

2557
01:38:33,318 --> 01:38:35,443
DailyVee on garage sales.

2558
01:38:35,443 --> 01:38:37,568
It's gonna be, following
me to the garages.

2559
01:38:37,568 --> 01:38:39,401
I addressed this
on one of the episodes.

2560
01:38:39,401 --> 01:38:41,777
There were people that said
I staged it. (laughter)

2561
01:38:41,777 --> 01:38:43,902
What the fuck's the matter
with people? (group laughter)

2562
01:38:43,902 --> 01:38:45,235
They're like
"There's no way there's tags

2563
01:38:45,235 --> 01:38:47,401
"on this, from a garage sale."

2564
01:38:47,401 --> 01:38:49,027
I'm like, "have you
been to a garage sale?"

2565
01:38:49,027 --> 01:38:51,027
People sell brand new shit
they've never even opened.

2566
01:38:51,027 --> 01:38:53,401
We're Americans, we buy
shit and don't even use it.

2567
01:38:53,401 --> 01:38:55,765
Anyway,

2568
01:38:55,765 --> 01:38:57,348
we're gonna tape
the whole thing,

2569
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:59,182
I'm gonna post it,

2570
01:38:59,182 --> 01:39:02,057
and then we're gonna, it's
gonna be the whole thing.

2571
01:39:02,057 --> 01:39:03,275
- [Woman 5] You're so right,
'cause I have three kids--

2572
01:39:03,275 --> 01:39:03,938
- Done.

2573
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:04,961
- [Woman 3] And after I watch that

2574
01:39:04,961 --> 01:39:06,811
- But at the right time.

2575
01:39:06,811 --> 01:39:09,081
- [Woman 3] After I saw that, 
I went through my three kids'

2576
01:39:09,081 --> 01:39:10,623
stuff and found so
many things with tags,

2577
01:39:10,623 --> 01:39:12,956
and I was like oh my gosh,
eBay, this is it, this is it.

2578
01:39:12,956 --> 01:39:14,498
And I decluttered
a whole bunch of stuff--

2579
01:39:14,498 --> 01:39:16,550
- [Gary] I asked Misha 
the other night,

2580
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:18,842
Misha, what have we learned
from garage sale-ing?

2581
01:39:18,842 --> 01:39:22,259
She goes, that you can get
better deals at garage sales

2582
01:39:22,259 --> 01:39:25,958
than the toy store. 
(group laughter)

2583
01:39:25,958 --> 01:39:27,588
That's right,
can't teach environment,

2584
01:39:27,588 --> 01:39:29,226
but you can create
new environments,

2585
01:39:29,226 --> 01:39:31,976
little micro 
environments, right?

2586
01:39:36,111 --> 01:39:37,778
Shit.

2587
01:39:37,778 --> 01:39:39,278
I love you guys.

2588
01:39:39,278 --> 01:39:40,403
Thank you.

2589
01:39:40,403 --> 00:00:00,000
(group applause)
