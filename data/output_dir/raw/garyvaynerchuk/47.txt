1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:04,810
- Just close your eyes until you're 29.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,612
Everybody wants to come up with excuses.

3
00:00:06,612 --> 00:00:08,441
I'm this, I wasn't born that way...

4
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:09,833
- I'm stuck, I'm in a rut.

5
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:11,795
- I wasn't born here, this.

6
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:13,675
You can't be lost in life
when you're this young.

7
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:15,987
I'm a female. I'm an immigrant.

8
00:00:15,987 --> 00:00:17,821
I'm a minority.

9
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:19,130
I'm transgender.

10
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,172
Excuses.

11
00:00:20,172 --> 00:00:22,935
Reality the problem is nobody cares.

12
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:24,545
Your lack of patience is killing you.

13
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:26,998
It's slowing you down and everybody else.

14
00:00:26,998 --> 00:00:29,332
Your need of things is killing you.

15
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:30,618
I don't need a fucking watch.

16
00:00:30,618 --> 00:00:32,054
I don't need a fucking whip.

17
00:00:32,054 --> 00:00:34,690
You need to be happy 'cause
happiness drives everything.

18
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,065
You're not lost in life you're
just early in the process.

19
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:39,396
Everybody's trying to
prove something so early.

20
00:00:39,396 --> 00:00:41,450
You fucking wrap your head
around not giving a fuck

21
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,783
about any advancement til you're 29.

22
00:00:43,783 --> 00:00:46,357
Please whatever it takes
call your grandmother,

23
00:00:46,357 --> 00:00:49,741
go to your great
grandfather's burial spot.

24
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,416
Go back to the old country.

25
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,212
Go to a shelter.

26
00:00:53,212 --> 00:00:54,295
Do something.

27
00:00:55,517 --> 00:00:59,652
Do something that
recalibrates your perspective

28
00:00:59,652 --> 00:01:01,952
on what is actually going on here.

29
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,428
Every person in here
fucking won the lotto.

30
00:01:04,428 --> 00:01:05,431
You won.

31
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:06,601
Way too many people have made decisions

32
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,259
without ever trying.

33
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:10,426
Everybody's judging
themselves way too early.

34
00:01:10,426 --> 00:01:12,592
You can literally do four different things

35
00:01:12,592 --> 00:01:15,927
over the next two years,
six months at a time

36
00:01:15,927 --> 00:01:18,691
to figure out everything that
you think you might like,

37
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:20,018
you should try to do.

38
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:23,574
Doing something around passion
is very similar to love.

39
00:01:23,574 --> 00:01:25,906
You're blinded because you like it.

40
00:01:25,906 --> 00:01:26,912
- [Man] It's not rational.

41
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:27,910
- It's not rational.

42
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,332
The number one reason I push patience.

43
00:01:30,332 --> 00:01:32,368
Patience, man. Patience.

44
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:33,955
Everybody's looking up to audit themselves

45
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:35,081
where they are now.

46
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:38,029
Is 'cause patience will give
you the air cover to take risk.

47
00:01:38,029 --> 00:01:39,207
Time is your asset.

48
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:41,753
What I would do is gather as
many experiences as possible.

49
00:01:41,753 --> 00:01:44,808
The one thing a 20 year old has
over me is 20 fucking years.

50
00:01:44,808 --> 00:01:46,053
(laughing)

51
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:47,679
Get the fuck out of the
machine for a second.

52
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:49,420
And think about what you're doing here.

53
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,844
If you get optimism and patience,

54
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,978
you're fucking off to the fucking races.

55
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:57,616
The 99% that achieve are
willing to sacrifice,

56
00:01:57,616 --> 00:02:01,008
be persistent, put in
disproportionate work,

57
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:04,675
and think in 50 year
terms not 50 day terms.

58
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:11,002
Just close your eyes until you're 29.

59
00:02:11,002 --> 00:00:00,000
Just close your eyes until you're 29.
