1
00:00:00,234 --> 00:00:02,069
- I have to get shots.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,538
I'm going to Ghana.

3
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:07,441
I don't want shots!

4
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:09,943
("Unstoppable" by This Is Wolff)

5
00:00:28,841 --> 00:00:31,841
("What I Am" by Luke O'Brien)

6
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,981
Wednesday morning

7
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,584
busy, busy day.

8
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:53,220
I'm supposed to be 
in L.A., got canceled,

9
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,387
so loaded up the Cali 
instead of going to Cali.

10
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,373
You know last time 
we hung, we were like,

11
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:15,676
"Hey, let's really try to do
this at least once a quarter."

12
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:16,510
- [Man] Yeah.

13
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,545
- [Gary] I really, 
really want to use this.

14
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:21,615
I had him book it in already
for the rest of the year.

15
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:22,583
It's just important.

16
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,483
- [Man] Yeah. I agree, man.

17
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,876
- [Gary] Just important.
- [Man] I agree.

18
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,770
I have to get shots.

19
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,339
I'm going to Ghana.

20
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,337
I don't want shots.

21
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:58,719
Big win last night.

22
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,953
- Big win last night.

23
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:00,787
- You needed that.

24
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,621
- How you doing?

25
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,758
- Good, man.
- What's up, Ty?

26
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,827
- What a great character.

27
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,903
Ty, can I walk you 
through this real quick?

28
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,005
- [Tyler] Yeah.

29
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:18,905
- This is the big one.

30
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:19,740
- Those the shots you need?

31
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,409
- Yeah. This is the big one.

32
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,611
Address. Where do I live?

33
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,748
Hey, bro. How are you? 
Good to see you.

34
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:28,782
- You?
- Good.

35
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,651
- I was here like 
"What?" Got it. That's good.

36
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,485
- And he hit him up?

37
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,319
- I know Just had 
been talking on it.

38
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,920
- Yeah exactly. So he hit me up

39
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,755
- And he did that...

40
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,590
- And then... and 
then I sent 'im this

41
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,959
- And then I saw this. 
And wrote that...

42
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,961
- Good, Good. Good.

43
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:41,862
- Good to see ya

44
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,830
- Yeah likewise. How's things?

45
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,400
- Very simply, I just 
think you're a great dude,

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,002
and I just want you to,
macro is a piece of cake--

47
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:49,836
- Yes.

48
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,772
- 60 days from now is 
a foregone conclusion.

49
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:52,606
- Right.

50
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:55,575
- What I like about the way
I think about the world, is

51
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,544
if I can bring 
value in those 60,

52
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,913
like I'm not like "Oh, 
this will be fine in 60 days"

53
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:00,747
- Right, right.

54
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,984
- I'm kinda like, if I can
make it from a 6.3 to a 7.1

55
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,853
in those 60 days, well 
then let me hear it.

56
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,687
- [Man 2] I think, yeah,

57
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,863
it's just some 
people don't have that

58
00:03:09,863 --> 00:03:12,225
that outside, let's say...

59
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,093
- Oh, I get it man

60
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,194
- [Man 2] That 
experience to understand

61
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,496
how real what 
you're saying is. You know?

62
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:17,330
- [Gary] It's very simple.

63
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,166
- If you play the 
chess game out,

64
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,916
If I'm sitting her with 
(censored) like, here's your

65
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,470
data and she's like, 
"Well, I didn't trust it."

66
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,205
I'm like, "Then you 
shouldn't work here."

67
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,039
- [Man 3] Yeah.

68
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,541
- If you don't trust 
the machine that goes to me,

69
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,975
well then, 
what're we doing here?

70
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,845
People do things now, 
just to PR themselves.

71
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,246
- [Lee] Yeah.

72
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,614
- People literally go hiking,

73
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,616
38 people here will go hiking

74
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,118
(Gary laughs)

75
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:40,554
38 people will go hiking 
in my office this weekend.

76
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,823
They'll drive an hour and a
half out to upstate New York

77
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,424
just for the Instagram shot.

78
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,026
Have you been to the 
meditation studio on twenty?

79
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,462
Can you send him 
the info right now?

80
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:49,296
I want you to go 
and check it out.

81
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,231
I'd love to get your opinion.

82
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,666
- Want me to 
give you a meditation?

83
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,134
- Yeah. Let's do it.

84
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:58,038
- So, here's how easy it is.
It uses the acronym SHERPA.

85
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:58,872
- SHERPA. Go ahead.

86
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,640
- It's gonna go through
S-H-E-R-P-A

87
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,475
- Let's do it. You ready, Nate?

88
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:02,309
- I'm ready.

89
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,978
- So feet on the floor, 
close our eyes.

90
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,481
(gong reverberating)
- So

91
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,508
"S" is "Shhhh"

92
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,829
It's a hard thing to 
get to, that quietness.

93
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,533
Sometimes I just see 
the black of my eyes.

94
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,000
Eyelids.

95
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,334
"H" is "Here"

96
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:38,145
You don't have to 
say it. Just think it.

97
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:42,315
So it's "H-E-R-E". 
Just try and be here.

98
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,453
And in New York, it's "H-E-A-R"

99
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:50,524
Let the noises not bother you,
but let them bring you here.

100
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:54,694
Just be here right now. 
Take a few breaths with that.

101
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:04,504
"E" is "Experience". 
Experience your body.

102
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:09,176
If you need to sit up, 
and get your posture right.

103
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,510
"R" is "Realize"

104
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:15,248
Realize how good 
things are right now.

105
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,717
We're not in a 
dangerous situation.

106
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,320
Just realize where we are.

107
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,755
"P" is "Purpose".

108
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,759
It could be your 
purpose for today,

109
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,461
it could be a bigger purpose.
Just take a few breaths,

110
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,464
and remind 
yourself of your purpose.

111
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,467
"A" is "Action"

112
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:40,240
Just think of one step 
that you're gonna take next,

113
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,577
to satisfy your 
purpose and move forward.

114
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,121
See it.

115
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,051
Then let's take 
action and open our eyes.

116
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,586
(gong reverberating)

117
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,187
- That's awesome.

118
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,155
- It was good.

119
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:58,191
- It is good. I'm really, 
I'm a big believer

120
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,668
I think that mental 
health, mental fitness,

121
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:05,265
meditation, it's gonna 
be the whole thing.

122
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:06,199
- Yeah.

123
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,300
- And it's gonna be good.

124
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,070
- It doesn't have to be like
this Kumbaya stuff, like ...

125
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,638
- No, no, no. I mean...

126
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,673
- I do this before a 
meeting that I'm about to...

127
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,541
You know? Just to...

128
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,310
- Oh I have... 
I would tell you,

129
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,913
50% of my friends 
are hard core deep.

130
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:20,780
- Yeah.

131
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,083
- One thing I live about 
my life as a businessman,

132
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,618
is I don't wanna be 
at the mercy of anybody.

133
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:27,554
I love that everybody 
can leave, and I feel okay.

134
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:32,259
At a micro, 
I don't want there to be

135
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:35,095
four people that can do TV,
or seven people that can,

136
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,592
I don't like that feeling,
and I like stretching it out.

137
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,471
Hey eerybody, 
this is Gary Vay-ner-chuk

138
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,794
and this is episode 249

139
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:48,441
of The #AskGaryVee Show!

140
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,710
Here's the one 
thing I can promise you.

141
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,979
You need to work 
you're fucking face off,

142
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:57,784
and, nobody gives a 
shit about where you grew up.

143
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,987
Nobody's gonna feel 
sorry for you circumstantially,

144
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,017
or feel positive for you,

145
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:04,658
whether you're 
born in the ghetto

146
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,826
or you're born to a trust fund,

147
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,029
at the end of the day, 
once you hit the real world

148
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,398
nobody cares, 
'cause then the clock's on.

149
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,667
If you're a trust fund baby, 
people are judging you

150
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,802
like, "You suck. It's 
all 'cause of your daddy."

151
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,837
If you're fuckin' 
from the ghetto, it's like

152
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,939
"You have no shot. 
You don't look the part."

153
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,509
Either way, nobody cares.

154
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:25,912
The end, the only thing that
you should be figuring out

155
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,047
is what are you good at?

156
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:30,083
And so you should try 
a lotta shit, right?

157
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,919
And, then you need 
to work every minute.

158
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,355
Like, if you're not 
gonna go to college,

159
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,290
you're gonna 
have to work, right?

160
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,460
Like, if you're not gonna 
use the brand of the degree

161
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,630
and before MissionU mean
something to the whole world,

162
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,598
you're gonna have 
to work, and prove it.

163
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:46,766
- I like it.

164
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,109
- I love you brother.
- I love you too, man.

165
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:49,235
- Adam Braun.

166
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,771
You keep asking questions,
we'll keep answering them.

167
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,973
It's funny. I never 
had anything happen.

168
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,677
I tore my meniscus 
five years ago, seven, no

169
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,179
eight years ago, 
playing basketball.

170
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,181
Didn't even really know.

171
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,650
I tore the other meniscus?

172
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,720
Like, when you do 
something, I'm like ...

173
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,888
As I was falling, I'm like,

174
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,081
"Tore my meniscus!", 
like literally!

175
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:14,081
("Whatever You Like" by Tryce)

176
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:19,866
What I like, is that people
think that this is the empire?

177
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,835
And I think this is like...

178
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:25,638
You know when your table is
wobbling? At a restaurant?

179
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,240
And they come over 
and slide a piece of wood

180
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,375
to make it stable?

181
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,209
- [Woman] Yep.

182
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,744
- That's literally how 
I think of this company.

183
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:31,878
That I think it's 
just a piece of wood.

184
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:32,712
- [Woman] Yeah.

185
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,114
- And that excites me.

186
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,782
That I know we've 
built something meaningful,

187
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,116
that it's doing great

188
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,784
- [Woman] And 
totally independently--

189
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,787
- Yes. But that it's

190
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,124
a proxy to my bigger thoughts.

191
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:47,127
I'm funny, right? Like, my
best day the other day was,

192
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,529
I was playing my kids in
basketball in the living room

193
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,464
two-on-one to five.

194
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,000
I let them go up four 
nothing, and then I beat them.

195
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,834
- Yeah.

196
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:55,935
- And when I hit the
game-winner,

197
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,504
they collapsed into crying 
like deep crocodile tears.

198
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,439
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

199
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:00,273
- I was pumped.

200
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,641
- (laughs) I love that.

201
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,042
- I think that matters.

202
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:07,757
And by the way, my son 
has more toys right now,

203
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:10,316
my son gets more toys in a
month, than I had in my life.

204
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,151
- Right.

205
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:14,454
- Do you wanna 
hear how weird it is?

206
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:17,657
Now you're gonna get a, your 
first real insight in to me.

207
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,793
Your first real, real one.

208
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:23,062
I am fearful, that 
I'm doing it on purpose,

209
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,498
to not let them 
be hungrier than me.

210
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,332
- Thank you.

211
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,267
- That was fun.

212
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,301
- Yeah. Yeah.

213
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,804
- It's the context of the
religion of the distribution.

214
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,172
The reason I make content,

215
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,507
that always tends to 
have a better chance,

216
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:38,745
is my creative can literally 
be a four to your nine,

217
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,548
every time, but when 
my distribution is a ten

218
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:44,751
to the market zero, 
I don't wanna use your,

219
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,686
I'm just in the game.

220
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:50,290
I'm literally predicting...
I looked at DRock yesterday,

221
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,691
and said I just 
made a viral video.

222
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,420
And it went viral 
yesterday. Like, I know.

223
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:02,902
Check this out.

224
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,437
A friend of mine 
form the liquor business

225
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,740
texts me, "Congrats on China."

226
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,642
I write "?. Not 
sure what that means.

227
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,177
"Love you. How you feelin'?"

228
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,078
He goes,

229
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,249
"Trying to walk" ... 
he's not feeling well ...

230
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,453
"A friend of mine said" ...
" A friend of mine in China,

231
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:20,653
"said you were getting 
your name out there."

232
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:25,305
("Power" by Duo)

233
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,997
Guys, thanks for all your help. 
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

234
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,833
Cheers. Cheers. Nazdrave.

235
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,801
- What is that?

236

- Nazdrave. It's Russian.

I'm out.

238
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,847
- [Man 3] Please don't
tell me it's the first time

239
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:48,715
you've ever had one?

240
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:49,749
- [DRock] No.

241
00:10:49,749 --> 00:00:00,000
- See ya.
