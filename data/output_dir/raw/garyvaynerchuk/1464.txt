1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,639
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of my days in boardrooms</font>

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,160
you have been in a number of those

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,600
boardrooms we got the biggest challenge

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,460
you think are in those boardrooms then

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,960
everybody's full of that people

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,790
don't make that people know but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

7
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,559
true right like let's really like well

8
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:14,969
especially this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the man I</font>

9
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,590
love it when it's like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's</font>

10
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,480
let's let's talk about it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> real right</font>

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,330
the problem with boardrooms our people I

12
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,880
was so naive to corporate America I was

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,619
an auto my whole life I grew my family's

14
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:26,960
business then I was into startups

15
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,550
corporate America somebody makes a

16
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,679
decision in a boardroom or some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,329
businesses that is completely predicated

18
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,309
on their bonus not what's best for the

19
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:38,309
product<font color="#E5E5E5"> or completely predicated on how</font>

20
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:39,780
they can politically grow within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

21
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,579
organization or how to make their boss

22
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,920
look good bad or indifferent so what

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,300
ends up happening is you sit in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

24
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,300
boardroom where people aren't aligned on

25
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,460
what's right me my dad bought every

26
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,640
single day for nine years building Wine

27
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,320
Library every day I fought<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my dad</font>

28
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,239
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> proud to sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say that I</font>

29
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,149
cried a hundred times cried but there's

30
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think back to now that blows</font>

31
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,170
my mind which is that my dad and I only

32
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,320
ever gave a about the logo it was

33
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,000
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what my dad wanted it was</font>

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,439
never about what I wanted it was never

35
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">about who made more money it was nothing</font>

36
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,760
other than the local wine

37
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,680
library right that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not happening in</font>

38
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">board rings corporate America people</font>

39
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't give a about selling more</font>

40
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,650
cereal or soda or and they're

41
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,720
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things and there's</font>

42
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,900
seven agendas I mean I have a very tough

43
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,310
time with what's going on between

44
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,439
agencies and brands I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

45
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">our agendas are aligned like you know I</font>

46
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,180
think agencies do a terrible job back to

47
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,790
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> naivete to you guys like I didn't run</font>

48
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,530
an agency I think the reason we built a

49
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">really big company really fast as I</font>

50
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,590
didn't know the rules I didn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

51
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you should charge for every hour</font>

52
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,000
that you sneeze right like I didn't know

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,350
this I just want to do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

54
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,420
work I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do what was right</font>

55
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,920
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sell go figure</font>

56
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,880
fair enough yeah but you know at the

57
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,500
same time so it's real<font color="#CCCCCC"> bye yeah no I</font>

58
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,090
looked at I sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> there with you I thought</font>

59
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,860
the challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I faced more than</font>

60
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,399
anything is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i see is so there's one</font>

61
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,288
set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the boardroom no no</font>

62
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:11,760
want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that there's one set of</font>

63
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">people in the board room which is senior</font>

64
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,150
leaders there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> another set of people</font>

65
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,069
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> boardroom which are more junior</font>

66
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,980
marketers that enter into a system that

67
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,260
is actually built on not necessarily

68
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">making sure that they live up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to their</font>

69
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:26,700
potential so what makes me<font color="#E5E5E5"> nervous and</font>

70
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,230
you well then this let's talk about

71
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,790
school then yeah ferret out like if you

72
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">really want to know I think business</font>

73
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,450
lunch on the real conspiracy yeah but I

74
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this is cool too I think you know</font>

75
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:37,019
look one person people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have student</font>

76
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:40,400
loans raise<font color="#E5E5E5"> your hand yeah blows</font>

77
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,980
some horseshit or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so we did we</font>

78
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,480
did it we did a survey out of the top

79
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,909
100 business schools all of the

80
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:49,950
descriptions of classes only one percent

81
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,480
of those descriptions use the word

82
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,010
digital in it yes so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you</font>

83
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,120
something about business schools in

84
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,560
America you're looking at somebody right

85
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,980
now who failed who failed<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I always</font>

86
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,419
have the preface I tell all my friends I

87
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:01,950
was a bad student and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> hanging out</font>

88
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">with all these millionaires and</font>

89
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,310
geniuses I think they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I got</font>

90
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,319
B's right unlike no asshole I got

91
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,019
 f's right so you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

92
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,579
somebody up here right now who failed

93
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:13,709
all his classes who went to Mount Ida

94
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:15,870
college right cuz I got a postcard in

95
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,000
the mail 2nd semester of my senior year

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,739
and brought in my guidance counselor and

97
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,010
she's like it go and so all right

98
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,400
so meanwhile now I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and speak at all</font>

99
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,829
these places right I go to Harvard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

100
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,199
University of Chicago and Michigan and

101
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,180
all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> places and I always go and sit</font>

102
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,040
and listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the curriculum before I</font>

103
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,349
speak because what I snipped out was

104
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:39,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">like holy it's abysmal abysmal</font>

105
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,790
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about that is all</font>

106
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,560
about three years ago let alone now

107
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,540
that's crazy and I actually think we're

108
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,829
failing most of the people who are

109
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,959
entering in as a result of that but the

110
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I think so the challenge I</font>

111
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">think you face is which I see you face</font>

112
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:56,669
sometimes directly in that so many brand

113
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,319
marketers are afraid to actually take

114
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,609
your guidance and pull the<font color="#CCCCCC"> trigger on</font>

115
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,079
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're suggesting of</font>

116
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,669
course because nobody gets fired for

117
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:04,739
doing television or big knows that but

118
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,269
the bigger problem that is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

119
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:09,299
don't get fired they become obsolete in

120
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,310
25 years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they sit and say stagnant</font>

121
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,720
and the exact same place in their career

122
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,090
so what I get frustrated about is that

123
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,649
they're not told<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the way to</font>

124
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,690
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow is to do things different</font>

125
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,159
by the way there's a ton of people who

126
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,048
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same there's very few people i</font>

127
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:23,670
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i think the other thing</font>

128
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,930
we have to realize it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an</font>

129
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,550
all-or-nothing game the thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

130
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,130
blown me away about corporate or these

131
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,840
organizations is that they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

132
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,090
Navy SEALs unit right like the US

133
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,560
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the biggest thing and we</font>

134
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,330
have the biggest military and I always

135
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">use this equation right like we have a</font>

136
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,260
big army television print you know we

137
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,900
have a big army scale right but to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

138
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,140
certain jobs done there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 40 dudes</font>

139
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,760
40 chicks right that make happen

140
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,920
the fact that these organizations have

141
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,770
not created allocation of dollars for

142
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,320
ninja units to go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually make</font>

143
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,390
 happen seems crazy to me because

144
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,280
it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small allocation of dollars</font>

145
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,960
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the scheme of what they spend each</font>

146
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,420
year and meanwhile I mean listen you

147
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,560
know this and if we're gonna get into

148
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">this like you have your very junior</font>

149
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,490
brand managers controlling the money not

150
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,590
senior leadership which is fascinating

151
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">to me right I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

152
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,060
I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that we have any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> artists /</font>

153
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,590
scared<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes there's good you know like</font>

154
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,060
and then I sit in all these senior

155
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,170
meetings that are like well the brand

156
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,340
manners aren't doing their job like

157
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,200
asshole you're not giving them

158
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the permission and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the funny thing is in</font>

159
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,010
the end of the day like<font color="#CCCCCC"> essentially</font>

160
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,700
judge asshole but he does say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

161
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,800
the way when there and you're like what

162
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,230
he really means is that the appropriate

163
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:39,810
terminology sorry sir Oh anyway I you

164
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,370
know we're running out of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

165
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought that it was interesting and I</font>

166
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,800
also think so you talked about the big

167
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,360
data I walked by a panel and said big

168
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,790
data needs to be small data and I was

169
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,710
like really<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of the but I</font>

170
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,970
thought it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting about the</font>

171
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,730
repackaging so one last question yeah so

172
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,740
what do you think is and I'm again I'm

173
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,180
talking from the brand marketer sampling

174
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,180
what kind of think is the one if you

175
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,460
could tell them to go do one thing that

176
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">would help open up their perspective</font>

177
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,200
what would it be man there's so

178
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,060
many um one thing one thing one focus

179
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,510
one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up the problem</font>

180
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">for me with that answer is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the to answer</font>

181
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,900
that question and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm as many of you</font>

182
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">know I'm never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure to give a quick</font>

183
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,190
answer is that I only care about

184
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,730
execution<font color="#E5E5E5"> I only care about execution so</font>

185
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,290
when I try to reverse-engineer what a

186
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,590
brand marketer needs to do

187
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,540
actually then go and execute it could be

188
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to a conference of being inspired</font>

189
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,620
it could be going<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working with a</font>

190
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">start-up for a month to see how it</font>

191
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,790
actually is but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reality is it's</font>

192
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,130
almost like you know if I told<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to</font>

193
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,320
do one thing it be to go tell their

194
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,930
bosses what they actually feel because

195
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,850
the horse is what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the</font>

196
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,920
problem the fact that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

197
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,770
community it's it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationships</font>

198
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,090
it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know people don't communicate</font>

199
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,310
enough right like we just don't

200
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,380
communicate enough like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's</font>

201
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,420
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> too much horse there's too</font>

202
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,070
much and then people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

203
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,200
crippled to go and execute and that's

204
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,760
the real thing that you see and the

205
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,460
reason I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that my company can</font>

206
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,190
execute is that I have not<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to</font>

207
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">convince my team that I'm not joking</font>

208
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,540
that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give them 15 minutes at a</font>

209
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,220
time and that they can say anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

210
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,540
been surprising to me that they haven't

211
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,220
taken me up on that it's been surprising

212
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,870
if they're still scared<font color="#E5E5E5"> of me and that</font>

213
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes me realize holy</font>

214
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,160
infrastructure man like me right like

215
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see what I am right there's still</font>

216
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,030
that intimidation based on layers how do

217
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">we create</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that gets actual</font>

218
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,310
authentic real dialogue going on because

219
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,130
everybody is crippled by rules

220
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,190
and tons of tradition<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't</font>

221
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,310
actually matter in a 2014 world and

222
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,790
that's why barnes<font color="#CCCCCC"> & noble and borders go</font>

223
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,980
out of business that's why in the

224
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">consumer packaged goods brands you guys</font>

225
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,580
are always trying to buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> chobani and</font>

226
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">redbull and vitamin water and you're</font>

227
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,360
unable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it yourselves because</font>

228
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just too much horse which</font>

229
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,290
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you slow and everything is</font>

230
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,600
predicated on speed speed is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the game</font>

231
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,300
and if you can't execute fast you can't

232
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">win because by the time you execute on</font>

233
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,110
your promise the world moved on

234
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,010
you all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> ladies and gentlemen give</font>

235
00:08:21,010 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">a big round of applause</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to carry</font>
