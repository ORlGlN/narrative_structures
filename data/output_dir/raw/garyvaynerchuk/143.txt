1
00:00:01,707 --> 00:00:03,658
- What are you gonna do with the money?

2
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:05,174
Like, what do you need?

3
00:00:05,174 --> 00:00:07,674
(light music)

4
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:12,420
All right Steve, we had a
good meeting, do you agree?

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,409
- Fabulous.

6
00:00:13,409 --> 00:00:14,697
- Jets, Dolphins this weekend,

7
00:00:14,697 --> 00:00:16,744
so it's usually a weird week for us.

8
00:00:16,744 --> 00:00:18,348
- Well, you're on the right side now.

9
00:00:18,348 --> 00:00:19,653
(laughing)

10
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,667
- All right, one piece of
advice for young entrepreneurs.

11
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:24,836
- One piece of advice,
believe in yourself.

12
00:00:24,836 --> 00:00:26,112
- Period.
- Period.

13
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,057
- Confidence.

14
00:00:27,057 --> 00:00:28,359
- That's the most important thing.

15
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,154
- Love you, man. See ya later.

16
00:00:30,154 --> 00:00:31,875
Great meeting with Steve this morning.

17
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:35,315
You know, anytime you're spending
obnoxious amounts of time

18
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:38,159
with billionaire football owners,

19
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,064
who also happen to be the
greatest human beings,

20
00:00:41,064 --> 00:00:42,523
you're doing the right thing.

21
00:00:42,523 --> 00:00:45,676
So good morning, good
start, gets me excited,

22
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:48,471
pumped up, looking forward to a vlog.

23
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:49,918
Love you guys,

24
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:52,335
and let's see how today goes.

25
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,283
See ya.

26
00:00:55,283 --> 00:00:58,491
I think I just wanna play until I die.

27
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,250
You know, and that's why
when somebody likes it,

28
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,042
no matter what the fuck it is.

29
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:05,671
Once you love the game,
whatever that is, you win.

30
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:06,947
The problem is in entrepreneurship,

31
00:01:06,947 --> 00:01:09,180
especially modern-day entrepreneurship,

32
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,942
we do not celebrate the game.

33
00:01:10,942 --> 00:01:14,428
We're putting the riches on a pedestal.

34
00:01:14,428 --> 00:01:16,826
You have to love the game.

35
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:21,024
I just don't know how you can
be a modern-day CPG business

36
00:01:21,024 --> 00:01:23,714
and not have a disproportionate strategy

37
00:01:23,714 --> 00:01:27,633
on Amazon, Walmart,
Saintsbury, Tesca, you know,

38
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:31,732
direct-to-consumer, Facebook,
Instagram conversion.

39
00:01:31,732 --> 00:01:34,330
All this stuff is just so important.

40
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,612
How one can be a common
sense individual in 2018

41
00:01:37,612 --> 00:01:40,072
and not start putting real effort towards

42
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:42,524
building those capabilities,
even if you're losing money

43
00:01:42,524 --> 00:01:44,404
on your PNL in the short-term

44
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,119
to build up those capabilities,

45
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:47,784
blows my mind.

46
00:01:47,784 --> 00:01:49,815
I am pumped that I'm doing an interview

47
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:52,468
and will be on the record,
I wanna be on the record

48
00:01:52,468 --> 00:01:56,043
that the lack of effort, both
mentally and financially,

49
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:59,554
into direct-to-consumer
capabilities is the reason

50
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:02,426
the majority of the Fortune 500 CPG brands

51
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:05,718
will be in massive decline a
decade from this interview.

52
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:08,218
(light music)

53
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:13,511
It's the chase, it's the
process, it's the game,

54
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:19,202
and your energy consistently
is kinetic towards

55
00:02:21,094 --> 00:02:24,593
this thing that I think is gonna
make you make the decisions

56
00:02:24,593 --> 00:02:27,593
that won't let you get to the thing.

57
00:02:29,476 --> 00:02:31,910
- Alright, you just want to look at this

58
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,896
next schedule with me real quick?

59
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:38,063
- Do I have another call? I
have a call two minutes ago.

60
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:45,438
Tyler's not on top of the
schedule the same way I am.

61
00:02:45,438 --> 00:02:49,105
That needs to be discussed
more on the vlog.

62
00:02:50,043 --> 00:02:53,124
I'm super-sharp, you know that's--

63
00:02:53,124 --> 00:02:55,541
you know what must be disheartening?

64
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,085
You're so busy, busier than almost

65
00:02:57,085 --> 00:02:58,772
every single person watching this.

66
00:02:58,772 --> 00:03:01,718
The problem is, it's that
when I'm catching it,

67
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:04,904
you know you're not busier
than me, so there's that--

68
00:03:04,904 --> 00:03:07,096
you've been suffocated out of the excuse

69
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:09,222
that would make so much
sense to everybody else.

70
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,728
The problem is, it's me
that's doing the catching.

71
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:13,121
- Yeah, no, I--

72
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:15,538
- Its heartbreaking out here.

73
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,440
This is Gary Vaynerchuk.

74
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,115
What's up dude? You look
cool with glasses, man.

75
00:03:24,115 --> 00:03:26,315
That actually kind of caught me off-guard.

76
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:29,942
I genuinely think you look much better.

77
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:31,249
- Cool thanks.

78
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:32,082
- Do you think that too?

79
00:03:32,082 --> 00:03:32,975
- Yes, I do.

80
00:03:32,975 --> 00:03:33,830
- Do you?

81
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,738
- They help me to see.

82
00:03:35,738 --> 00:03:37,712
- The fact that they help you to see,

83
00:03:37,712 --> 00:03:39,972
and you're better looking and cooler--

84
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:41,558
- But a lot of people dig them.

85
00:03:41,558 --> 00:03:43,371
- Dude, I didn't actually really,

86
00:03:43,371 --> 00:03:45,942
for a hundredth of a second,
looking down, recognize you,

87
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:47,824
and I'm like, "Who's that
good-looking big man?"

88
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:48,845
(laughter)

89
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:50,445
- Yeah, I wore them to
a wedding on Saturday.

90
00:03:50,445 --> 00:03:54,612
- Dude, I think you really, I
think your life has changed.

91
00:03:56,784 --> 00:03:57,617
Yes, sir?

92
00:03:57,617 --> 00:03:58,790
- Following up--

93
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,083
- Oh look at who's here,
talk about a handsome man.

94
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,666
- What's up boss? How you doing man?

95
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,569
- Getting back in shape,
doing the whole thing.

96
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:10,094
You can tell that the Gary
Dary V, getting back in shape.

97
00:04:10,094 --> 00:04:11,877
- His Long Island accent that comes out

98
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,485
when he performs in the camera,

99
00:04:13,485 --> 00:04:14,860
- We're from Long Island right?

100
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,373
- Is that a thing?

101
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:18,426
- It's not but I'm aware.

102
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:19,709
- Yeah, go ahead DeMayo.

103
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:20,971
- Where in Long Island are you from?

104
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:22,634
- I grew up in a town called Hewlett.

105
00:04:22,634 --> 00:04:24,038
- Oh yeah, I'm from Malverne.

106
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:25,366
- Oh I didn't know that.

107
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:28,108
- By the way, 5-1-6 represent.

108
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:31,759
Following up with people on Instagram?

109
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,592
- I'll do it.

110
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:34,360
- Obviously not your VIP's.

111
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,820
- Oh, not the people in my inbox,

112
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,234
the people in the Instagram?

113
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:39,284
- Not the people that are like--

114
00:04:39,284 --> 00:04:41,561
- Do it. Go through everyone
who hasn't replied, be like,

115
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:44,825
"Gary just asked me to check
in" and I'll come over the top.

116
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:47,144
- And then, also, a couple people have--

117
00:04:47,144 --> 00:04:48,515
- How many have filled out?

118
00:04:48,515 --> 00:04:49,464
- 55

119
00:04:49,464 --> 00:04:51,420
- We have speakers, I'm excited.

120
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,631
- 55, once you-- I just
went back through our

121
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:59,487
list on social rank of everybody
that has 50-100K followers,

122
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:02,573
picked out about another 20 more people.

123
00:05:02,573 --> 00:05:03,988
- I still think there's more people

124
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:06,481
that we didn't pick 100,000 and up,

125
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:07,648
so I'd like to find five minutes

126
00:05:07,648 --> 00:05:10,564
to do that one more time
with you, and I'll be direct.

127
00:05:10,564 --> 00:05:13,422
You know what I mean? 50
is getting into territory

128
00:05:13,422 --> 00:05:14,909
where I'm not sure I want to do that.

129
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:16,283
- Okay, are you only interested in

130
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:17,239
hitting up people that follow you?

131
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,619
- Yes.

132
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:19,804
- The one person I was --

133
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:22,578
- Because when you cold
DM that way and their--

134
00:05:22,578 --> 00:05:26,477
- But you have relationships
with people that don't follow.

135
00:05:26,477 --> 00:05:27,310
- Yeah.

136
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,663
- Yes, I'm okay with that.

137
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:31,627
- Like that kid, the Benjamin Kicks.

138
00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:33,351
Like, I don't think he follows you.

139
00:05:33,351 --> 00:05:36,292
- Well I'm gonna punch
him in his fucking face.

140
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:38,004
Benji Kicks, I'm gonna
punch your fucking face

141
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,192
if you don't follow me.

142
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:41,078
Cool.

143
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:42,081
- Cool.

144
00:05:42,081 --> 00:05:44,164
I'll get started.
- Cool.

145
00:05:48,172 --> 00:05:50,683
A professional athlete is scary to me.

146
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,911
You live your whole life growing
up, you're gonna be this,

147
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:55,852
and by American standards for athletes,

148
00:05:55,852 --> 00:05:59,011
somewhere in your 30's you're done.

149
00:05:59,011 --> 00:06:01,036
Then you're lost.

150
00:06:01,036 --> 00:06:03,173
That's why it's fun to see
the young athletes want to be

151
00:06:03,173 --> 00:06:04,461
entrepreneurs because
they're all gonna have

152
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:05,538
a lot more to do.

153
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:08,700
(calming music)

154
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,477
I genuinely believe that
I sabotage my wealth

155
00:06:11,477 --> 00:06:13,790
to string out my game.

156
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,559
I'm in it for the game.

157
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:17,740
Why don't I like the Yankees
and the Rangers anymore?

158
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,381
They won.

159
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:21,505
Now I only like the Knicks and the Jets.

160
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:23,577
It's the chase.

161
00:06:23,577 --> 00:06:25,771
It's the process.

162
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:26,938
It's the game.

163
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:31,908
- G!

164
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:33,322
- My man!

165
00:06:33,322 --> 00:06:34,261
- I been runnin' around man.

166
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:35,094
- Hustlin'.

167
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,906
- Yeah, brother it's crazy.

168
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:37,739
- Alright, what's up?

169
00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:38,572
Is this it?

170
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:40,727
You need to send me jersey
to put in here, man.

171
00:06:40,727 --> 00:06:41,733
- You don't have one of my jerseys?

172
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:42,566
- I do some --

173
00:06:42,566 --> 00:06:43,399
You know?

174
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,232
You gotta have one?

175
00:06:44,232 --> 00:06:45,065
- I got it.

176
00:06:45,065 --> 00:06:46,108
- Send me one.

177
00:06:46,108 --> 00:06:46,941
- The Jet one right?

178
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:47,774
- Yeah.

179
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:48,607
25.

180
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:49,749
Nah, not Arizona.

181
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:50,582
Get out.

182
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:51,533
I love you.

183
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:52,366
I'll see you soon man.

184
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:53,199
- I appreciate it, thank you.

185
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,032
- Yeah, appreciate it.

186
00:06:54,032 --> 00:06:54,865
Kerry Rhodes.

187
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:55,828
The best.

188
00:06:55,828 --> 00:06:57,211
(calming music)

189
00:06:57,211 --> 00:07:01,128
And your energy consistently
is kinetic towards

190
00:07:02,577 --> 00:07:05,136
this thing that I think
is gonna make you make

191
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:09,238
the decisions that won't
let you get to the thing.

192
00:07:09,238 --> 00:07:13,267
My chase of the New York
Jets by eating the shit

193
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,934
18 hours a day is the lifestyle.

194
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,832
And we have 95 percent of the market

195
00:07:19,832 --> 00:07:21,575
believing that the lifestyle is

196
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,552
you do something to get the fun stuff

197
00:07:24,552 --> 00:07:26,412
and it's the 5 percent that understand the

198
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:29,341
process is the fun stuff
that get to buy the

199
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:31,165
95 percent of stuff.

200
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:32,029
You got it?

201
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:35,233
- [Caller] Yeah, that's
so trippy but so true.

202
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:36,529
Thank you so much, Gary.

203
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:37,771
- You got it brother.

204
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:40,037
That was just synthesized
to this whole game.

205
00:07:40,037 --> 00:07:41,806
There's this thought that you

206
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:42,639
(puking sound)

207
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,975
and then, "Yay!".

208
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:44,808
Nuh uh!

209
00:07:44,808 --> 00:07:46,787
The whole thing has to be
"Yay!", whether is results

210
00:07:46,787 --> 00:07:50,027
in dollars that are here,
up here, or up here.

211
00:07:50,027 --> 00:07:52,831
Unless you're in that
"Yay!" the whole way,

212
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,781
you're finished.

213
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:55,151
You're finished.

214
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:57,473
I think a lot of people
graduate from ice cream

215
00:07:57,473 --> 00:07:59,147
to vacation home.

216
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:01,425
I think people are caught in the game.

217
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:03,351
I think people are confused, man.

218
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:07,805
Like to me the process of
making that cake is interesting.

219
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:10,442
The though of can I buy
the eggs for a good deal?

220
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:12,823
Can I create a flavor
of carrot cake mix with

221
00:08:12,823 --> 00:08:15,007
mint chocolate chip that
no one's ever done before?

222
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:18,104
Can I be remembered for making great cake?

223
00:08:18,104 --> 00:08:20,751
- [Bob] But you're also
not afraid to be wrong.

224
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:21,718
- That is damn right.

225
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:22,853
- [Bob] You're not afraid to be wrong.

226
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:23,686
- I'm not.

227
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:25,472
And I also will own it if I'm wrong.

228
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,793
I love being wrong
because I love the game.

229
00:08:27,793 --> 00:08:30,987
And if I was wrong that
means the game is pure.

230
00:08:30,987 --> 00:08:33,104
Of course, that's the best part.

231
00:08:33,104 --> 00:08:34,982
And I didn't need it in my 20's

232
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,461
so I could buy a yacht to get girls.

233
00:08:37,462 --> 00:08:38,943
I'm not that insecure.

234
00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:40,996
An insecurity is what's hurting someone.

235
00:08:40,996 --> 00:08:42,727
- [Bob] It depends what you want.

236
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:43,560
- Yes.

237
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:45,078
- [Bob] If all you want is
the yacht and the girls --

238
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:45,911
- You can do that.

239
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:46,744
- [Bob] You can do that.

240
00:08:46,744 --> 00:08:47,577
- And you know what?

241
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:49,789
By the way, as a dude, sounds fun.

242
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:51,886
Jake wants it bad.

243
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:53,236
Jake.

244
00:08:53,236 --> 00:08:54,069
- [Jake] Not really.

245
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:54,973
- Jake!

246
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:56,077
- [Jake] I wouldn't mind it.

247
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:56,919
- Okay.

248
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:57,793
(laughing)

249
00:08:57,793 --> 00:08:59,351
Let's go to the next question.

250
00:08:59,351 --> 00:09:00,519
That was amazing.

251
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,487
- Ben from Rhode Island.

252
00:09:01,487 --> 00:09:02,320
- Ben.

253
00:09:04,465 --> 00:09:07,132
(calming music)

254
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,328
What's up, vlog?

255
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:15,828
Super intense day.

256
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:17,595
A lot of meetings.

257
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:19,107
I don't know what Iris is
gonna get out of it but

258
00:09:19,107 --> 00:09:21,213
heading to the Digital Uncorked.

259
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:25,296
It's a new concept that
Vayner Media has created.

260
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:30,372
A lot of people aren't
in a place financially

261
00:09:30,372 --> 00:09:32,562
where they want to invest in the 4Ds,

262
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:34,985
10,000 dollar consulting
project so we created

263
00:09:34,985 --> 00:09:38,690
a more intimate, fun,
obviously much shorter version

264
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,591
and using me instead of
the Vayner Media staff.

265
00:09:41,591 --> 00:09:44,291
So we created called Digital Uncorked

266
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,958
$2,000 business dinner event and

267
00:09:48,632 --> 00:09:49,864
I'm heading over there for the first one.

268
00:09:49,864 --> 00:09:51,557
So I'm excited about our kind of new world

269
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,545
that we're involved in and

270
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:55,009
should be interesting to see how we can

271
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:56,619
deliver a lot of value
in this environment.

272
00:09:56,619 --> 00:09:57,452
So, we'll see what's up.

273
00:09:57,452 --> 00:09:59,624
(calming music)

274
00:09:59,624 --> 00:10:01,589
You know I know a lot of you
came for the business stuff

275
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:03,371
but if we can achieve
anything for me because

276
00:10:03,371 --> 00:10:04,925
I have so much love
for and is the platform

277
00:10:04,925 --> 00:10:08,391
that my family, basically,
on the platform of wine

278
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:09,838
made it in America.

279
00:10:09,838 --> 00:10:11,630
So, I have a lot of emotion for it.

280
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,233
If I can get you to try
new things, that would be

281
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:16,145
such a remarkable accomplishment.

282
00:10:16,145 --> 00:10:18,272
Sanserre is especially interesting to me,

283
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:20,833
because I do think that
people that do like white wine

284
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,860
tend to get into Chardonnay and drink it

285
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,587
over and over and over.

286
00:10:24,587 --> 00:10:26,823
What's cool about Sanserre,
and maybe you've seen this,

287
00:10:26,823 --> 00:10:29,027
is it's not super heavy

288
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:31,255
but it's super crisp and complex.

289
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,521
So, it's interesting and
not boring like a lot of

290
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:36,230
average white wine that's
light and what have you.

291
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,756
But more importantly, it's an incredibly

292
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:41,756
flexible wine when it comes to food.

293
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:46,617
So, it's ability to do
with fish and salads

294
00:10:46,617 --> 00:10:49,895
and light fare and by itself
is super interesting to me.

295
00:10:49,895 --> 00:10:51,789
So, I hope you enjoy it.

296
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:53,105
It comes from a really good producer.

297
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:54,120
It's super clean.

298
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,698
If you're an oysters and
clams and shellfish fan

299
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:01,637
like I am, like this is a
hardcore pairing for that world.

300
00:11:01,637 --> 00:11:03,562
So keep that in mind if
you want to nerd it up

301
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:04,628
or take a note.

302
00:11:04,628 --> 00:11:05,827
And then finally,

303
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:08,745
I want you guys to do
something with all the wines

304
00:11:08,745 --> 00:11:10,872
we have tonight, which is sniffy sniff it,

305
00:11:10,872 --> 00:11:12,718
and here's what I mean by that.

306
00:11:12,718 --> 00:11:15,558
The core thing that you can
do to really get into wine

307
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:18,114
is make sure you smell it.

308
00:11:18,114 --> 00:11:21,906
And I don't mean this
smell that seems like kind

309
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:23,028
or cordial.

310
00:11:23,028 --> 00:11:25,414
I mean getting your whole schnoz in there

311
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:26,589
and really smell it.

312
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:28,547
I've seen a lot of you taste wines?

313
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:30,372
Both the red and white already.

314
00:11:30,372 --> 00:11:33,145
If you've tasted normal,
if you could now smell it

315
00:11:33,145 --> 00:11:35,780
hardcore and then taste it again,

316
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,156
it'd be interesting to see
if you felt that it tasted

317
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,477
different than it did one minute ago.

318
00:11:40,477 --> 00:11:43,542
I think for a lot of you,
you'll be really taken aback

319
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:47,130
on how extreme the flavor
profiles can be when you do that.

320
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,015
So, I want to allow you to do that.

321
00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:52,951
So, in the theme of tonight,
I want to do a lot of

322
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:53,912
Q and A.

323
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:56,890
So, I kind of created my two frameworks.

324
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,897
I've walked around the first fourth.

325
00:11:58,897 --> 00:12:00,768
I'll finish off in a little bit.

326
00:12:00,768 --> 00:12:03,932
But, I'd like to open up the mic again,

327
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,251
I think that a lot of you
have a lot of context.

328
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:07,547
Some willing to go anywhere.

329
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:09,140
Answer anything from

330
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,948
any of your business
questions, hopes, aspirations.

331
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:14,072
I'm thrilled to talk.

332
00:12:14,072 --> 00:12:15,095
New York Jets football.

333
00:12:15,095 --> 00:12:17,875
Whatever you want to go
and talk about I'm here.

334
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,218
So, whose got a question?

335
00:12:20,218 --> 00:12:21,385
One more time.

336
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:24,772
What's your goal?

337
00:12:26,374 --> 00:12:28,387
In like black and white?

338
00:12:28,387 --> 00:12:30,689
What do you think your goal is.

339
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:31,522
- Ah, man.

340
00:12:31,522 --> 00:12:33,173
I thought about it a lot.

341
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:35,114
It's so easy to go back to revenue.

342
00:12:35,114 --> 00:12:35,948
If that makes sense.

343
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:37,306
- Sure, of course.

344
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:38,592
Everybody thinks that

345
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,138
Revenue's a proxy.

346
00:12:40,138 --> 00:12:41,485
So?

347
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:45,849
- I want to be able to hire
honestly at least 500 people.

348
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,381
- Why that number?

349
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:48,892
- Well, at least 500.

350
00:12:48,892 --> 00:12:51,258
- You know what I'm most
worried about in our

351
00:12:51,258 --> 00:12:52,477
couple interactions?

352
00:12:52,477 --> 00:12:55,273
I feel like you're coming
up with arbitrary things.

353
00:12:55,273 --> 00:12:56,564
Why not 700?

354
00:12:56,564 --> 00:12:58,202
Why not at least 9,000?

355
00:12:58,202 --> 00:12:59,452
Why is it a 500?

356
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:00,490
Can it be 150?

357
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,323
The fuck?

358
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:03,057
What does that all mean?

359
00:13:03,057 --> 00:13:04,259
Do you understand?

360
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:05,092
- Yeah.

361
00:13:05,092 --> 00:13:06,235
- Like, I don't think
that's the right way to

362
00:13:06,235 --> 00:13:07,196
think about it.

363
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:08,029
From my perspective.

364
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:08,862
I could be wrong.

365
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:09,695
- Yep.

366
00:13:09,695 --> 00:13:10,567
- But like I think

367
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:12,605
it has no actually grounding.

368
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:16,093
I wanted to buy a sports
franchise when I was little,

369
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:17,616
and the romantic part I learned English,

370
00:13:17,616 --> 00:13:19,591
I get it that's cute, I like it.

371
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:23,350
But it was because I wanted
to make such a big goal

372
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,433
so that I could keep playing forever.

373
00:13:28,413 --> 00:13:30,120
Getting to 500 employees
is going to be done

374
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,516
real quick if you're good enough.

375
00:13:32,516 --> 00:13:34,126
Then what?

376
00:13:34,126 --> 00:13:37,631
What you don't want to be is an athlete.

377
00:13:37,631 --> 00:13:40,027
A professional athlete is scary to me.

378
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,237
You live your whole life.

379
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,288
Growing up you're gonna be this.

380
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:45,131
And by American standards for athletes,

381
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:48,340
somewhere in your 30's you're done.

382
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,400
And then you're lost.

383
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,406
That's why it's fun to
see the young athletes

384
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:53,608
want to be entrepreneurs because their all

385
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:55,844
gonna have a lot more to do.

386
00:13:55,844 --> 00:13:58,672
It's an arbitrary number Rach.

387
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,033
Pay very close attention to my goal.

388
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:02,116
My goal is so ridiculous.

389
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,817
When you start trying to rush to 500,

390
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:07,460
you start over hiring
when you don't need it,

391
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,127
because it means like you're
getting closer to 500.

392
00:14:10,127 --> 00:14:14,826
But having 113 or 157 means
no fucking real difference.

393
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:16,821
If you want the money,
that means you want to

394
00:14:16,821 --> 00:14:17,988
buy something.

395
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:21,412
When people say to me, believe it or not

396
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:22,930
it's not about the money I'm like,

397
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:23,763
"Huh?".

398
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:29,074
It may be the ego of the
number, because at dinner

399
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:30,470
you want to tell your best friend it's now

400
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,119
13 instead of 8, maybe.

401
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:33,952
I get that.

402
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:35,474
I understand that.

403
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,391
I don't know, but like,

404
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:40,311
what are you going to do with the money?

405
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:41,606
Like what do you need?

406
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:44,372
The reason there's so few people

407
00:14:44,372 --> 00:14:46,996
that actually get the things
because they're the ones

408
00:14:46,996 --> 00:14:48,863
who are purebred, don't give a fuck

409
00:14:48,863 --> 00:14:50,990
about the things.

410
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,208
Purebred.

411
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,041
Naturally.

412
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:53,874
I didn't manifest this.

413
00:14:53,874 --> 00:14:54,707
I didn't force this.

414
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:55,540
I didn't read a book.

415
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,190
It came natural to me
to not want anything.

416
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,395
You need to really figure yourself out.

417
00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:01,949
Because once you figure yourself out,

418
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:03,526
you're cruising.

419
00:15:03,526 --> 00:15:05,049
You start rolling.

420
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:08,244
Once you figure yourself out
nobody has leverage on you,

421
00:15:08,244 --> 00:15:09,551
because once you understand yourself,

422
00:15:09,551 --> 00:15:11,414
you start putting yourself
in positions to not

423
00:15:11,414 --> 00:15:14,418
let a lot of people have leverage on you.

424
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:17,160
And I don't want to let you do that.

425
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,456
- This is heavy.

426
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:20,248
- It's super heavy.

427
00:15:20,248 --> 00:15:22,081
- Sorry, I'm pregnant.

428
00:15:23,174 --> 00:15:24,243
- But, Rach it's good stuff.

429
00:15:24,243 --> 00:15:25,183
- It really is.

430
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,825
- You have to go to
that next place because

431
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,650
you're just throwing things
at the wall and I get it.

432
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,191
The problem is that it's
going to feel real empty

433
00:15:30,191 --> 00:15:31,941
when you get there.

434
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:33,400
And then when you love the game,

435
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,067
500 and 2047 just all goes away.

436
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,884
It all gets real slow.

437
00:15:41,884 --> 00:15:42,717
You know?

438
00:15:44,472 --> 00:15:46,850
I'm really glad you guys came out tonight.

439
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,517
(calming music)

440
00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:51,504
Good event.

441
00:15:52,593 --> 00:15:56,136
I don't like when D-Rock produces me so--

442
00:15:56,136 --> 00:15:58,027
Well Iris could have asked.

443
00:15:58,027 --> 00:15:59,062
Iris could have asked.

444
00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:00,288
I don't like when D-Rock produces me.

445
00:16:00,288 --> 00:16:01,121
I love

446
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:04,086
when Iris produces me.

447
00:16:04,086 --> 00:16:06,308
- If you wanna do an outro to the evening

448
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:07,409
that would be awesome.

449
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:09,643
- Vlog, she's the best.

450
00:16:09,643 --> 00:16:11,438
My outro is, it was a great fucking night.

451
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:16,316
The content in this event
was straight fucking fire.

452
00:16:16,316 --> 00:16:18,401
And all three of you know it.

453
00:16:18,401 --> 00:00:00,000
(calming music)
