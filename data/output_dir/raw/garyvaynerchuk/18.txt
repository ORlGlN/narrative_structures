1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,430
- A lot of people don't spend
two weeks consuming my stuff

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,200
so they see a headline
or two and they're like,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,891
"Yo hustle this or hustle that."

4
00:00:06,891 --> 00:00:10,141
(peaceful piano notes)

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,830
I always talk about sleeping a lot.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,190
I always talk about, like if you love it,

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,639
you know look what anybody here

8
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:20,610
and definitely anybody
listening or watching,

9
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,090
if you really love it, like for real.

10
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,270
Not like you're kind of saying it

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,810
'cause you're trying to
get through your life.

12
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,800
If you really love it,

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,660
it truly isn't feel like work.

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,130
Like school felt like work
and that was only like

15
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,830
nine to three with tons
of breaks in between

16
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,860
and that was devastating.

17
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,693
You know?

18
00:00:35,693 --> 00:00:37,840
My audiobook, reading it.

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,660
I'm only halfway through, that's work.

20
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,830
- [Interviewer] You looked
like you were in hell.

21
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,540
I was watching the video today.

22
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,840
- It's not easy for me, man.

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,000
Like I don't like it.

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,660
And so like I know what work,

25
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,520
I know what not liking it feels like

26
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,687
and what work feels like.

27
00:00:50,687 --> 00:00:53,612
Being an entrepreneur for
me, running businesses,

28
00:00:53,612 --> 00:00:55,775
putting out content, doing my thing,

29
00:00:55,775 --> 00:00:57,760
does not feel like work.

30
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,010
I mean look.

31
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,240
I talk a lot about hard work.

32
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,780
There's not a whole lot
of content coming from me

33
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,218
on the weekends.

34
00:01:04,218 --> 00:01:07,870
I take four, five, six, seven
weeks of vacation a year.

35
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,476
Like what I'm doing is I'm
maximizing my 15 hours a day

36
00:01:10,476 --> 00:01:15,128
during the week but I, yeah.

37
00:01:15,128 --> 00:01:19,320
My only kryptonite is
the health of my family.

38
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,240
From the day I left school in May of 1998

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,560
to this moment, I've
always been the operating

40
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,430
partner of a business.

41
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,263
Everyday.

42
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,660
Everyday.

43
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,890
- [Interviewer] I think
that gets blown by.

44
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,836
- [Gary] Yeah.

45
00:01:32,836 --> 00:01:33,669
- [Interviewer] People
get stuck on the noise.

46
00:01:33,669 --> 00:01:34,502
- Look, look.

47
00:01:34,502 --> 00:01:36,390
I think people should and that's life.

48
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,560
People get caught up and sizzle over steak

49
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,760
everyday of the week.

50
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,380
But I like that because I
think I'm kind of playing

51
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,410
to that a little bit.

52
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,320
I think I'm forcing that narrative

53
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,010
'cause I'm a fan of the reveal.

54
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,040
Like aha, I told you.

55
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,770
Like I like being underestimated.

56
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,838
I prefer it.

57
00:01:50,838 --> 00:01:53,743
I'm more comfortable in it and so,

58
00:01:53,743 --> 00:01:55,572
you know, yeah.

59
00:01:55,572 --> 00:01:57,910
And ultimately I also don't care.

60
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,940
Like the truth is gonna speak.

61
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,700
Like you're not gonna build

62
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,100
a billion dollar by accident business.

63
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,630
Like either you're good
enough or you're not

64
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,940
and so I know how this plays out.

65
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,470
Other than the health and
wellbeing of myself and my family,

66
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,720
there's no shot I don't achieve
enormous business success

67
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,553
in my life.

68
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,620
I'm too good at it.

69
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,510
- [Interviewer] It's interesting though,

70
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,920
I mean 'cause you say that you don't care

71
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,511
and I know you don't and that
reptile part of your brain

72
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:24,980
I very much admire.

73
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,813
- [Gary] Yes.

74
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:26,850
- But then I've also gone on Reddit

75
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,446
'cause I've spent fucking
two weeks doing this.

76
00:02:28,446 --> 00:02:29,279
- Yes.

77
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:30,140
- [Interviewer] And seeing you.

78
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,967
- Interact with people,
do it all the time.

79
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:33,920
- [Interviewer] Slate said
that something like 80%

80
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,480
of your tweets are fucking replies.

81
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,313
- Yep.

82
00:02:36,313 --> 00:02:37,660
- [Interviewer] Which,
that is a staggering stat.

83
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,144
- I have empathy for people
that don't see it my way.

84
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:44,960
I'm so thankful that
somebody consumes my content

85
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,620
that even if they say I'm a charlatan

86
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,990
and a Snake Oil Salesman,
I wanna show the respect

87
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,490
of them engaging in my content to reply

88
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,615
and have the conversation
'cause I'm intrigued

89
00:02:55,615 --> 00:03:00,615
by the insight of, I'm in
tune with how I'm perceived

90
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,110
by engaging with people
that started off by thinking

91
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,180
I was a shit.

92
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,260
And I'm also empathetic.

93
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,440
I'm a pretty funny character in a snippet.

94
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,743
Two Weeks Full Consumption you gotta read,

95
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:17,743
28 seconds in a stream,
in the right moment,

96
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,930
I'm not super fun for a lot of people.

97
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,440
Plus, I'm also a suffocater.

98
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,260
I will suffocate shit.

99
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,630
The reason I think I'm helping people is

100
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,590
I'm suffocating bullshit
like no, this is not

101
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,190
the President's fault.

102
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,270
No, this is not your bosses' fault.

103
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,450
This is, you're insecure.

104
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,960
And you're insecure
probably 'cause your mom's

105
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,793
a piece of shit.

106
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:37,800
So we need to talk about that.

107
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,890
That's not conversation that
people are excited about.

108
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,590
Like, hey great news,
your boss isn't a dick.

109
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,560
Your mom's fucked up.

110
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,433
Let's talk about it.

111
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,690
Em, not as interesting.

112
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,490
It's much more fun to
say my boss is a dick.

113
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,750
But that's not what's happening.

114
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,840
So, let's have that conversation.

115
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,110
I'm willing to go there because
I think I'll win in the end.

116
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,690
I think I'm bringing value.

117
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,860
And I take people's
attention very seriously.

118
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,360
And I will never take it
for granted and it manifests

119
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,350
in me being a kind guy.

120
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,530
It also manifests in
me engaging with things

121
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,740
that hurt my feelings.

122
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,940
I'm super pumped that
my fourth grade friends

123
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,640
and my sixth grade
teachers and people coming

124
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,880
out of the wood works,

125
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,560
I am not that thoughtful about it.

126
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,880
I am tripling down on who I am.

127
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,790
I'm as super charismatic and
nice as shit to everybody

128
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,520
long before I thought that
anybody would even know

129
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,170
who I was, 'cause that's my
DNA and how I was raised.

130
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:32,920
So, you know it's funny, I
didn't grab you that way.

131
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,155
I get it.

132
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:36,550
And it runs through my mind.

133
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,200
I'm very aware that there's eyes on me.

134
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,390
And now it's gotten
completely bat shit crazy.

135
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,680
Like it's super weird.

136
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,690
But the best part is bro,

137
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,900
it's exhausting playing a character.

138
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,790
I have the most energy,
but I would never be able

139
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,400
to win that game 'cause I
would have a vulnerability.

140
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,444
- [Interviewer] Well, it comes out.

141
00:04:53,444 --> 00:04:54,277
It's going to come out.

142
00:04:54,277 --> 00:04:55,120
- You will never win.

143
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,800
All this shit does, is
exposes who you actually are.

144
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,770
And so, I just like people.

145
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,603
I just like em.

146
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:06,580
Plus, I like looking 'cause
I like to learn from it.

147
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,010
Like I don't know, it's
a good place for me.

148
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,240
The world becoming more
people centric and at scale,

149
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,140
that became a really
good thing for me, man.

150
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,130
Like that really worked out for me.

151
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,930
My impact is extraordinary

152
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,830
and I'm in a totally different place.

153
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,502
And I'm really impacting people.

154
00:05:21,502 --> 00:05:23,040
And that's really cool.

155
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,870
Like you know, I don't
think people understand

156
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,200
what it feels like when
people send you emails

157
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,520
about being homeless and now being better.

158
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,100
And I really go into emotional places

159
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,070
with my entrepreneur talk.

160
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,380
Like I go there.

161
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,213
You know, I go there.

162
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:37,740
And so I'm enjoying myself tremendously.

163
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,698
You know what, I'm very aware.

164
00:05:41,698 --> 00:05:44,720
Like that coming back and
shaking your hand in that moment

165
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,960
is a good thing.

166
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,492
That people will understand that.

167
00:05:49,492 --> 00:05:52,750
I almost am having one
macro version of that

168
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,930
with myself right now.

169
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,660
I know that doing all these
right things are gonna lead

170
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,390
to some pretty extraordinary.

171
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,180
I mean, I genuinely believe
that everybody on earth

172
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,013
will know who I am.

173
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:03,470
I genuinely believe that.

174
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,916
- [Interviewer] Stay true
to you, that's what I hope.

175
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:09,340
- Brother, you have to
understand, it's binary.

176
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,070
There's just no event, even
like, I know there's no event.

177
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,309
I mean, I guess I could hit my head,

178
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,360
maybe a boulder.

179
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,300
Like I have some real, I don't
meditate 'cause I'm scared

180
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,293
to change who I am.

181
00:06:22,293 --> 00:06:23,219
- [Interviewer] I was
gonna ask you about that.

182
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:24,185
But I ran out of time.

183
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:25,047
You don't meditate.

184
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:25,880
- I don't.

185
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,520
That person has not gotten
you to fricking meditate.

186
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,353
- Nope.

187
00:06:28,353 --> 00:06:29,186
- [Interviewer] But Tony, he.

188
00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:31,326
- No, I feel in a very, very good place.

189
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:34,230
And I really am excited
about one core thing.

190
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,750
The fact that I've become
cool to a lot of young people

191
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,150
is a big deal.

192
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,360
Because now I've crossed a
chasm into a different place

193
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,840
where I'm able to redefine characteristics

194
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,880
of coolness that excite me.

195
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,010
If I can achieve making self
awareness, and patience,

196
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,710
and gratitude, and empathy
cool characteristics,

197
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,343
I'm an alpha male.

198
00:06:57,343 --> 00:07:00,240
Might have a real fucking at bat, man.

199
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,524
And honestly, I have that audacity.

200
00:07:02,524 --> 00:00:00,000
(peaceful orchestra music)
