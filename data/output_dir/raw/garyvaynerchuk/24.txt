1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,840
- This is dedicated to all the people

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,920
who are visionary enough to recognize the

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,150
enormous opportunities we've been given,

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,850
in this new digital age,
and who are brave enough

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,110
to demand and seek out happiness,

6
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,190
not only in their life
but also in their work.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,873
What's up Vlog?

8
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:31,490
I'm about to go into the studio.

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,240
Actually, I'm in the studio.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,790
About to record the
audiobook for Crushing It.

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,890
Pretty excited.

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,840
Baban was out 'til 4
o'clock in the morning.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,800
The Super Bowl, so

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,660
I'm gonna kick him out,

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,170
'cause he's not allowed in here, but

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,003
here we go.

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,577
It took all those years for it to happen.

18
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:49,667
But now I feel like I'm finally at a place

19
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,630
where I wanted to be.

20
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,957
It's crazy that this is where it is.

21
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:55,210
But I love it.

22
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,930
If you don't care enough to induce others

23
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,150
to rave about you,

24
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,130
all you're doing is holding a spot for

25
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,240
someone who really does care.

26
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,140
The one who will waltz
in and displace you.

27
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,090
This book features
entrepreneurs at all levels

28
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,730
of financial success.

29
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,830
And all stages of influence.

30
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,070
But those currently at
the pinnacle of both,

31
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,480
share three characteristics.

32
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,010
A commitment to service,
a desire to provide value,

33
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,120
a love of teaching.

34
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,600
If your nature is that at
least 51 percent altruistic,

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,240
and only 49 percent selfish,

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,450
you have a real shot of breaking out

37
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,350
because the vast majority of people

38
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,120
are 70 to 99 percent selfish.

39
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,758
Right?

40
00:01:37,758 --> 00:01:39,256
And it's very simple.

41
00:01:39,256 --> 00:01:42,570
Global and local dynamics
with digital aren't working,

42
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,850
there's nuances,

43
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,710
and everybody thinks
that they're solving it

44
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,310
by having all these offices

45
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,740
which creates even more
cooks in the kitchens,

46
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,830
not less.

47
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,480
By doing one, centric,
strategic based partner

48
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,750
who also over indexes in
these three pillars of

49
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,420
being peacemakers, being
deep practitioners,

50
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,690
having willingness to allocate
heavy hours to engagement

51
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,870
and speed of production and cost,

52
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,000
now you got something.

53
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,820
So just finished up the
audiobook here in Minnesota,

54
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,330
and

55
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,900
which was fun, maybe
a weird kind of thing,

56
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,530
and now we're here at the Mall of America

57
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,160
and about to go to Radio Row

58
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,900
where the media is, with
some of our athletes.

59
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,554
And obviously people want
to know what I'm up to

60
00:02:27,554 --> 00:02:28,506
with VaynerSports.

61
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:30,460
Let's go.

62
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,780
- [Host] Back here on

63
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,970
Live from Radio Row,

64
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,152
final day of broadcasting, we are here

65
00:02:35,152 --> 00:02:37,840
in Minneapolis at the Mall of America,

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,370
and quite a surprise this is,

67
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,210
the great Gary V will
now sit down with us.

68
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,055
Gary, what's up, my man?

69
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:43,950
- Life is good.

70
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,830
Other than the fact that
I've seen way too many

71
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,780
Patriot jerseys.

72
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,613
- Sickening.

73
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:49,450
- Am I allowed to curse on this show?

74
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,490
- Absolutely.

75
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,990
- I fuckin' hate the Patriots.

76
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,060
So I'm struggling with that,

77
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,893
but other than that,

78
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:55,600
life is tremendous.

79
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,260
- [Host 2] Gary, so
much of your videos are

80
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,440
a great way to inspire
so many young people,

81
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,480
such as ourselves, promoting
themselves on social media.

82
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,218
We have a lot of young viewers right now,

83
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:07,254
obviously we're two young
broadcasters ourselves.

84
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,530
What would be the number
one piece of advice

85
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,190
you would give to people
who graduated from college

86
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,580
over the last year?

87
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,850
- Reverse engineer the
attention that comes

88
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,940
native to you, aka

89
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,840
there is so much more
attention on Facebook,

90
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,180
podcasts, YouTube, Instagram, Snap

91
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,740
than people realize,

92
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,050
and the fact of the matter

93
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,040
if I decided to be the
biggest sports announcer

94
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,080
over

95
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,230
tomorrow, I really think in four years,

96
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,480
I'm in the conversation.

97
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,690
And it's because I have passion for it,

98
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,650
I have knowledge for it,

99
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,500
but most importantly,

100
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,054
I understand distribution of it.

101
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:40,340
So everybody who's listening,

102
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,320
if you want to do something,

103
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,810
if you want to be the
guy that knows more about

104
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,750
the Lions than anybody on Earth,

105
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,176
or if you want to be
the person that is the

106
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:48,960
foremost experts on middle relievers,

107
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,594
you can actually do that.

108
00:03:50,594 --> 00:03:52,962
And I'm stunned by
people not understanding

109
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:54,211
how much of a player

110
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:56,170
Bleacher Report and Barstool is,

111
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,110
in just seven to 10 years,

112
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,320
based on this thesis.

113
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,080
All of you fuckers understand this,

114
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,810
you either are not
willing to put in the work

115
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,643
to get there,

116
00:04:04,643 --> 00:04:07,010
or two, you actually don't realize that

117
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,330
you're sitting on
disproportionate knowledge.

118
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,282
Thanks guys.

119
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:11,400
Real pleasure.

120
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,620
Yeah man, we're off to a good start.

121
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,300
18 months in, we're
getting some real players.

122
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,910
It is the core of my existence.

123
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,213
Matt was part of the company

124
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:22,600
when we bought a small firm
to get into the business,

125
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,340
so our relationship,

126
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,030
and Robert it's all very special but

127
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,490
from day zero for me,

128
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,770
Matt's been a part of that family

129
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,370
and I think

130
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,010
it is very interesting for me

131
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,980
to actually care about a Broncos game now

132
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,270
because you care about the person.

133
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,900
You have a lot of thoughts
about business and

134
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,080
all the things that are gonna be happening

135
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,100
off the field that we can control as

136
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,620
agents and agencies

137
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,950
much more than what can
happen on the field.

138
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,710
We think that there's a
huge arbitrage to be had.

139
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,079
There's a lot being left on the field

140
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,786
and after a bunch of homework,

141
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:56,497
both on who they were and what
they thought they could do,

142
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,730
came to the top of the list and

143
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,970
the conversation started.

144
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,780
The punchline is, outside of a couple of

145
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,608
sporting goods companies,

146
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:05,510
and a couple of

147
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,070
besides football cards and sneakers,

148
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,390
these kids are not making
real economics off the field.

149
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,870
Meanwhile, in my other life,

150
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,530
I'm representing 15 year old teenagers

151
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,770
on Musically, making $700
thousand dollars a year

152
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,700
in marketing.

153
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,471
And so, they can build
much bigger audiences,

154
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:22,770
and so it's getting to know them,

155
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,395
not making them become
Gary V and doing like me

156
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:26,330
and vlog all day and do all this

157
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,300
and be crazy.

158
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,133
No.

159
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:28,966
Who are you?

160
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:29,930
And where can you go?

161
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,425
So it's reverse engineering.

162
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:32,952
- Thank you for coming by.
- Thanks for having me.

163
00:05:32,952 --> 00:05:34,619
- Great to meet you.

164
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,960
- [Gary] If you've been making excuses,

165
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,460
you'll be exposed.

166
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,350
At which point, you can decide to stop

167
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,920
dicking around and achieve
what you set out to achieve.

168
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,000
Or, admit that your version of Crushing It

169
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,460
looks a little different
than you originally thought.

170
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,490
- We gotta get a picture, man.

171
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,436
- I cannot

172
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,820
I know this guy!

173
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,670
I played so many darts with this guy!

174
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,530
- Oh my goodness, how have you been?

175
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,930
- It is so good to see you, man?

176
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,280
- What are you doing?

177
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,960
- [Gary] I love you brother.

178
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,793
- Have to get a picture with you.

179
00:06:02,793 --> 00:06:03,626
- How are you?

180
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:04,459
- Awesome.

181
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:05,527
Awesome.

182
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:06,360
- Give a picture.

183
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,450
- This is a real college friend of mine.

184
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,283
Thank you, man.

185
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:10,190
I'll see you tonight.

186
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,023
- Yeah yeah.

187
00:06:11,023 --> 00:06:11,856
- Text me, okay?

188
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,583
- Chase's dad.

189
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,190
- Hey, man!

190
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,360
Hey, man how are you?

191
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,541
- Good, good I know
Chase was runnin' around.

192
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,621
- I know I was trying

193
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:19,787
this is my brother, A.J.

194
00:06:19,787 --> 00:06:21,150
- Hey nice to meet you.

195
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:21,983
- Tyler

196
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:22,816
- Nice to meet you.

197
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:23,649
- And Baban

198
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:24,482
- Hey great to meet you guys.

199
00:06:24,482 --> 00:06:25,315
- It's a pleasure, man,

200
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:26,148
I'm glad we got to see you.

201
00:06:26,148 --> 00:06:26,981
- My wife saw you

202
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:29,040
- [Gary] See, this book
is for two audiences.

203
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,790
The first is for people
who know to the depths of

204
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,650
their souls,

205
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,730
that they are born to
build something great.

206
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,250
Natural born entrepreneurs should find

207
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,740
all the information they need to

208
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,780
improve the current efforts
or start making plans

209
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,930
of their own.

210
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,150
Not just the young, not
just the tech oriented,

211
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,990
not just professionals
in established careers,

212
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,320
or those looking to renew themselves

213
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,520
because they've outgrown their industries.

214
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,794
Or worse, their industry is shrinking.
