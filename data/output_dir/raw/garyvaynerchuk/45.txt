1
00:00:01,747 --> 00:00:02,580
- What up vlog.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,033
Working out with Jordan this morning,

3
00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:05,501
here on the West Coast.

4
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:09,175
Anyway, on today's DailyVee,
we go into to a keynote

5
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:13,842
I did with Chase Jarvis at
kind of a photography summit.

6
00:00:15,657 --> 00:00:16,726
Obviously, the world of photography

7
00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:20,684
has been struck tremendously
over the last decade

8
00:00:20,684 --> 00:00:23,247
and this talk, I think,
covers a ton of that.

9
00:00:23,247 --> 00:00:26,101
So for your creative friends,
make sure they listen to this.

10
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:26,934
Hope you enjoy.

11
00:00:26,934 --> 00:00:29,351
(rock music)

12
00:00:34,024 --> 00:00:35,303
- Hello.

13
00:00:35,303 --> 00:00:36,777
Say hi to your neighbor for a second.

14
00:00:36,777 --> 00:00:38,350
You guys look all scared.

15
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,247
Introduce yourself.

16
00:00:40,247 --> 00:00:41,080
All right.

17
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,191
(laughs)

18
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:44,953
(imitating smooching)

19
00:00:44,953 --> 00:00:48,006
All right, I'm gonna start
it off since, I guess,

20
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,978
I've been a part of the photo industry

21
00:00:49,978 --> 00:00:52,478
for as long as I can remember.

22
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,308
I think it's really
important to understand

23
00:00:56,308 --> 00:00:59,659
that craft plays a really important role

24
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:03,104
in the life that you
all have chosen to lead.

25
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:07,104
You have to be good at it, but
just like professional golf,

26
00:01:07,104 --> 00:01:10,178
say there's 300 people
who play in the PGA.

27
00:01:10,178 --> 00:01:14,895
You can only name two or three
and everything beyond craft

28
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:16,367
is what will help you.

29
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,491
You have to have craft to get in the door,

30
00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:20,313
but if you don't have all the other stuff,

31
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:21,876
it's going to be very
hard to make the living,

32
00:01:21,876 --> 00:01:25,379
and more importantly,
the life that you want.

33
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:28,343
We are co-keynoting today,

34
00:01:28,343 --> 00:01:31,947
in part because I
realized over my career...

35
00:01:31,947 --> 00:01:34,586
The first time I came
here, I showed pictures.

36
00:01:34,586 --> 00:01:35,433
The second time I came here,

37
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:37,122
I showed pictures and told stories.

38
00:01:37,122 --> 00:01:40,013
The third time I came here, on this stage,

39
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:42,448
the third time I keynoted,
I showed pictures and videos

40
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:45,627
and told stories and
talked about social media.

41
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:48,613
The fourth time I came
here, I've been here a lot.

42
00:01:48,613 --> 00:01:50,151
(audience laughs)

43
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:54,476
Fourth time I came here, it was
all about outside influences

44
00:01:54,476 --> 00:01:57,759
and all the first one through five,

45
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,391
I feel like got picked up and absorbed

46
00:01:59,391 --> 00:02:01,846
and internalized from
the hundreds of folks

47
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:03,357
who are sitting in the audience today

48
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,094
and the thousands of people
who are watching these videos

49
00:02:05,094 --> 00:02:06,693
after we post them.

50
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,478
But what has not been internalized

51
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:13,395
is that the best information,
influence, ideas, strategies,

52
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,533
creative inspiration comes
from outside the industry.

53
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:19,957
It comes from outside.

54
00:02:19,957 --> 00:02:21,677
If you're all looking at
the person next to you

55
00:02:21,677 --> 00:02:24,979
for inspiration and they're
looking to you, what happens?

56
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,341
It's just a circle and I've seen that.

57
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:29,793
I'm thinking of my life
mission with CreativeLive,

58
00:02:29,793 --> 00:02:32,542
with my show, Chase
Jarvis Live, and in part,

59
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:35,787
by hanging around with
people like Gary and others,

60
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:39,142
to bring that inspiration
into our industry.

61
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:41,625
I feel like it's the number
one thing that's ignored

62
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:46,137
and this particular human has
had a huge influence on me,

63
00:02:46,137 --> 00:02:48,546
on popular culture in general,
and so I thought it'd be good

64
00:02:48,546 --> 00:02:52,615
if the biggest service
that I could be of service

65
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:56,378
in this community would be
to let you hear from someone

66
00:02:56,378 --> 00:03:00,045
who wouldn't normally
be here at this place.

67
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:04,019
So with that, I'm gonna
give you a question.

68
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:04,864
We're in conversation.

69
00:03:04,864 --> 00:03:07,116
This is the longest you've
been quiet, probably.

70
00:03:07,116 --> 00:03:09,239
(audience laughs)

71
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,087
- I'm literally bleeding inside my mouth

72
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:11,921
(audience laughs)

73
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:13,776
'cause I'm biting my tongue so hard.

74
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,361
That was super hard, whew!

75
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:17,543
- Give some introduction of--

76
00:03:17,543 --> 00:03:18,763
- Can I actually say
something before the question?

77
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:20,568
- Please, yes.

78
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:22,391
First of all, I'm very,
very humbled and flattered

79
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:24,513
to be here in this community.

80
00:03:24,513 --> 00:03:27,049
I think all subcommunities
are super fascinating.

81
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:29,888
They have their own DNA,
their own beating heart.

82
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:32,714
I have had the luxury
in the last seven years,

83
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:34,529
to build a creative agency.

84
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:39,049
VaynerMedia has 300
creatives that work for us

85
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:41,642
across many different offices,

86
00:03:41,642 --> 00:03:44,665
and the thing that I've
been most fascinated by

87
00:03:44,665 --> 00:03:46,642
is the thing that connects all of us,

88
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:48,623
regardless if we're in this industry,

89
00:03:48,623 --> 00:03:52,290
entrepreneurs, traders,
mothers and parents,

90
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:56,965
piano players or traders on Wall Street.

91
00:03:56,965 --> 00:03:57,798
Whatever it is.

92
00:03:57,798 --> 00:03:59,194
Whatever it is.

93
00:03:59,194 --> 00:04:01,443
What has been very fascinating to me,

94
00:04:01,443 --> 00:04:03,276
in this space, is ego.

95
00:04:05,724 --> 00:04:07,057
Ego is a killer.

96
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:10,282
You know, I've been really thinking about

97
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:12,588
coming here this morning and I was like,

98
00:04:12,588 --> 00:04:14,199
I really want to bring value.

99
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:16,766
I hope I say something
that really helps somebody.

100
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:18,156
And when things change,

101
00:04:18,156 --> 00:04:20,183
and we're living in a very changing world.

102
00:04:20,184 --> 00:04:21,409
A lot of our contemporaries,

103
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:22,711
maybe the people you looked up to

104
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:25,442
or your grandparents that
also did this kind of work,

105
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:29,078
creative work, they had
a strength or a weakness.

106
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:30,683
A luxury or an issue,

107
00:04:30,683 --> 00:04:32,270
depending on how you look at the world.

108
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,329
Their world stayed firm
and stable for a long time.

109
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:38,355
We do not have that luxury.

110
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:41,202
We're living during a great revolution.

111
00:04:41,202 --> 00:04:42,923
It's called the internet.

112
00:04:42,923 --> 00:04:45,829
It's now 20 years old on the consumer side

113
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:48,387
and it is the biggest shift to our culture

114
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:51,704
on a human level, let
alone on a creative level.

115
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:53,473
And what it's done is the following.

116
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:55,412
It's eliminated gatekeepers.

117
00:04:55,412 --> 00:04:57,285
The internet is the middle man.

118
00:04:57,285 --> 00:04:59,603
So, if I could leave
you with with anything,

119
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:00,683
I genuinely believe the thing

120
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:03,245
that has helped me be
successful in my trade

121
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:06,262
is that I deploy unbelievable
amounts of humility

122
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:09,159
for all my cockiness around one thing.

123
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:13,602
The market is the judge
and the jury, not me.

124
00:05:13,602 --> 00:05:15,851
And I think that in the creative field,

125
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:18,433
the thing that has hurt so
many people I care about

126
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:22,524
is they want to rest
on experience or awards

127
00:05:22,524 --> 00:05:24,209
that are arbitrary, by the way,

128
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:28,800
or degrees or something
other than the market.

129
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,800
You may not like it, but
the market always chooses.

130
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:36,843
- So, if I'm gonna pick up
on that thread for a second,

131
00:05:36,843 --> 00:05:41,581
I think that's part of
what I meant in what was...

132
00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:43,847
When I would speak,
what would be absorbed.

133
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:46,762
And I think there's also
this dramatic hesitation

134
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:49,834
that a lot of people say I can't do this.

135
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:50,667
I'm not this.

136
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:54,270
There's some punk who's 17
years old, with a camera,

137
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,644
and she's gonna kick my ass

138
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:58,121
and you're giving away trade secrets

139
00:05:58,121 --> 00:06:01,954
and it's unfair and I
think, as photographers,

140
00:06:03,804 --> 00:06:06,106
and I came into the
industry a long time ago,

141
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:07,016
it was very much closed.

142
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:09,823
It was about secrets, and
I'm not gonna bring in

143
00:06:09,823 --> 00:06:13,757
an assistant because
they're gonna learn from me

144
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:15,710
and they're gonna learn
my special lighting stuff

145
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,680
and then they're gonna go out

146
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,508
and they're gonna use that
against me to take money.

147
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:22,175
I've literally had death threats

148
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:27,061
and I'm not trying to
overdramatize it, but--

149
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:28,159
- Well, you're a pretty bad guy.

150
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:29,618
(audience laughs)

151
00:06:29,618 --> 00:06:30,451
I'm just kidding.

152
00:06:30,451 --> 00:06:32,473
- From people who have
said that I'm taking money

153
00:06:32,473 --> 00:06:35,715
by CreativeLive, we've given
away three or four billion

154
00:06:35,715 --> 00:06:38,697
minutes of free education.

155
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,490
- The internet has given away way more.

156
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,573
- Yes, for sure.

157
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:44,888
- I don't understand
what people are debating.

158
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:47,514
Information has been commoditized.

159
00:06:47,514 --> 00:06:49,074
You have to wrap your head around it.

160
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:52,598
You're more than welcome
to live in your own head

161
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:54,187
and create excuses.

162
00:06:54,187 --> 00:06:56,035
The problem is nobody gives a fuck.

163
00:06:56,035 --> 00:06:57,178
(audience laughs)

164
00:06:57,178 --> 00:06:58,595
It is what it is.

165
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:04,490
I wish that Email didn't
become not as popular.

166
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,742
I built my first business on it.

167
00:07:05,742 --> 00:07:07,722
I wish that Twitter was still number one.

168
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:09,805
I was one of the first people
with a million followers.

169
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:10,995
I wish, I wish, I wish.

170
00:07:10,995 --> 00:07:14,313
The only reason that
I have the great honor

171
00:07:14,313 --> 00:07:16,613
to sit on this stage right now

172
00:07:16,613 --> 00:07:18,647
is 'cause I give away all my best advice,

173
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,765
for free, every single day.

174
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:21,849
- [Woman] Thank you!

175
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:22,682
- You're welcome.

176
00:07:22,682 --> 00:07:24,040
(audience laughs)

177
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,369
You're welcome, and let me
tell you a couple things

178
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:28,831
that you may find unbelievably powerful,

179
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:31,184
and it may be a shift,
and I speak to somebody

180
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,149
in their 40's, like me, 50's, 60's, 70's

181
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:36,303
because your habits are formed.

182
00:07:36,303 --> 00:07:39,799
Let me say something that
might be a huge unlock.

183
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:44,799
99% of people don't do anything
about the free information.

184
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,374
The reason I give away all my best stuff

185
00:07:47,374 --> 00:07:48,956
is 'cause nobody does anything about it,

186
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:51,041
which leaves plenty for me to still do.

187
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:54,473
- And for the 1% that do,
those become your new friends.

188
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:56,157
Those are your peers
or the people you love.

189
00:07:56,157 --> 00:07:58,310
- Let me tell you one
other thing about those 1%.

190
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,131
They were gonna win anyway.

191
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:03,577
You can't stop winners
from winning, my friends.

192
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:05,874
And then you can educate the other 99%

193
00:08:05,874 --> 00:08:09,014
and get all the admiration
and leave a wonderful legacy

194
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:10,895
and live a fulfilled life.

195
00:08:10,895 --> 00:08:12,143
That's the model.

196
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:16,526
- As the owner of a creative
agency, I want to shift gears.

197
00:08:16,526 --> 00:08:19,505
Specifically, you work with a
lot of people who create media

198
00:08:19,505 --> 00:08:22,610
and what is your number
one piece of advice,

199
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,105
besides being grateful
and besides making sure

200
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,916
that you understand that
the market is right.

201
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:32,693
What is a tactic that you
feel like this audience,

202
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:34,501
by and large, is getting wrong?

203
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:37,214
- Be in the yes business.

204
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:39,132
Be in the yes business.

205
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,255
Instagram, yes.

206
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:42,698
Filters, yes.

207
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:44,022
Going live, yes.

208
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:45,237
Snapchat, yes.

209
00:08:45,237 --> 00:08:46,394
TPH, yes.

210
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:47,606
VR, yes.

211
00:08:47,606 --> 00:08:48,439
VR, yes.

212
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,827
Yes, yes, yes.

213
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:53,827
Why are you so fancy with your time?

214
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,409
Like, really?

215
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:57,242
You don't have time for this,

216
00:08:57,242 --> 00:08:59,407
but yet, you have the
ambition to get the luxuries

217
00:08:59,407 --> 00:09:03,216
that come along with being independent?

218
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:06,549
We do not map our actions to our mouths.

219
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:11,819
If you have aspirations
to win, to crush it,

220
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:14,077
to do it the way you want to do it,

221
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:15,431
you need to be in the yes business.

222
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:19,176
I, at this point, have
achieved enormous things

223
00:09:19,176 --> 00:09:21,805
and every day I deploy
humility to download a new app

224
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:24,709
and taste it, and waste my time

225
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:26,262
because I know I learn every time.

226
00:09:26,262 --> 00:09:28,831
I know the market's
moving, and I'm stunned

227
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,677
by how many creatives master a skill

228
00:09:31,677 --> 00:09:33,774
and then try to milk it for 47 years.

229
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:36,159
That's not the reality that we're doing.

230
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,835
And so, you need to be
in the yes business.

231
00:09:37,835 --> 00:09:39,988
Yet, I see creatives always saying no

232
00:09:39,988 --> 00:09:41,558
and they come up with
some arbitrary bullshit

233
00:09:41,558 --> 00:09:45,558
of why it's not pure and
then they get run over.

234
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,027
- So, little bit about the format.

235
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:50,420
If you're thinking that some of this

236
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,791
might be resonating
with you, at some point

237
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,187
in the next, I have no
idea how much time we have.

238
00:09:55,187 --> 00:09:56,020
We could talk all day.

239
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,876
I think you guys know us.

240
00:09:58,876 --> 00:10:00,053
- At some point--
- How much?

241
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:00,962
- Yeah, how much?
- 40 minutes.

242
00:10:00,962 --> 00:10:01,795
- What?

243
00:10:01,795 --> 00:10:02,628
- 40 minutes.
- 40.

244
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:03,739
- 40, okay right now, some
of you are going like,

245
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:05,109
"Oh shit, 40 more minutes of this."

246
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:07,073
(audience laughs)

247
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:07,906
- Hopefully--

248
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:09,320
- If you've done that, you've lost.

249
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,260
(audience laughs)

250
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,363
- Yeah, that's exactly that I
don't got time for this thing.

251
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,735
This seat right here is
reserved for a couple of people

252
00:10:16,735 --> 00:10:19,924
that would like actual
information from he and I,

253
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:21,721
one on one in real time.

254
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,400
So if you think you have a problem

255
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,270
that you would like to have solved,

256
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,677
I would like, I'm gonna
do a couple of these

257
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:29,368
throughout the 40 minutes here.

258
00:10:29,368 --> 00:10:33,116
So I would like one person,
I'll let Gary pick them.

259
00:10:33,116 --> 00:10:35,935
- I already invited him.

260
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,858
- Fuckin' A, we got it right here.

261
00:10:37,858 --> 00:10:39,271
(audience claps)

262
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,104
Right on.

263
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:41,599
How you doing, bud?

264
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,432
Right on.

265
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:43,265
- How are you?

266
00:10:43,265 --> 00:10:44,296
- I'm doing great.

267
00:10:44,296 --> 00:10:45,129
- Great to meet you.

268
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:45,962
- Oh my god.

269
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:46,795
(speaking faintly)

270
00:10:46,795 --> 00:10:48,399
(laughing)

271
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,806
- We gotta get this gentleman
a microphone, if we can.

272
00:10:51,806 --> 00:10:54,814
While we're finding a mic for you,

273
00:10:54,814 --> 00:10:56,993
I'll talk slowly so we can get you a mic.

274
00:10:56,993 --> 00:10:58,684
I see it coming.

275
00:10:58,684 --> 00:11:00,328
You're up here not just to hang out.

276
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:01,181
- Yes.
- Okay.

277
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:03,648
- You're up here because,

278
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:05,313
what I believe is about 100 problems

279
00:11:05,313 --> 00:11:06,506
that we all have.

280
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:08,728
As humans, we all have about 100 problems,

281
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:11,942
and they can be in
various different camps,

282
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:12,938
but we're gonna try-

283
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,553
We got time for that shit later.

284
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:16,318
(audience laughs)

285
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:17,774
- I'll record, I'll record it.

286
00:11:17,774 --> 00:11:19,011
- Oh my god.
- There you go.

287
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,033
(audience laughs)

288
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:23,366
- But what we're gonna do...

289
00:11:26,006 --> 00:11:27,457
They'll turn it on, just talk.

290
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:28,599
- Can't figure it out, okay great.

291
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:30,402
- Let me here.

292
00:11:30,402 --> 00:11:31,235
It's on.

293
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:32,068
Hold it close to your face.

294
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:33,145
- Let's start with your name.

295
00:11:33,145 --> 00:11:34,623
- Hello, I'm Jason McCoy

296
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:37,444
from Jason McCoy Photography,
in Chicago, Illinois.

297
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:38,412
- Give it up for Jason.
- Let's give it up for Jason!

298
00:11:38,412 --> 00:11:41,245
(audience cheers)

299
00:11:43,924 --> 00:11:45,532
- Jason, welcome.

300
00:11:45,532 --> 00:11:47,503
What's your biggest challenge right now?

301
00:11:47,503 --> 00:11:49,478
- I think my biggest challenge now is

302
00:11:49,478 --> 00:11:51,630
- I'm sorta--
- Being handsome!

303
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,502
(audience laughs)

304
00:11:53,502 --> 00:11:54,982
- They call me sexy chocolate.

305
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:58,334
(audience laughs)

306
00:11:58,334 --> 00:12:02,154
No, my biggest challenge now
is trading money for time.

307
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:05,623
So I don't have a problem
getting people in my studio.

308
00:12:05,623 --> 00:12:10,623
Now, it's like, okay, I only
can do, maybe two shoots a day.

309
00:12:10,977 --> 00:12:14,373
I want to make more money, but
I'm maxing out on just time.

310
00:12:14,373 --> 00:12:15,547
I don't want to work 24/7.

311
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:16,380
- Raise your prices.

312
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,630
- 10x your prices tomorrow.

313
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:21,602
I'm serious as a heart attack.

314
00:12:21,602 --> 00:12:25,039
If you 10x your rates, try it, 10x.

315
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:27,738
I say this on the internet
about twice a week.

316
00:12:27,738 --> 00:12:29,820
I get pages from people
who are like, "holy shit.

317
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,992
"I 10x'ed my rates and I'm still busy."

318
00:12:31,992 --> 00:12:33,536
They literally 10x their income.

319
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:35,014
- And here's the good part for everybody.

320
00:12:35,014 --> 00:12:37,401
If nobody's paying, that
means the market's answering,

321
00:12:37,401 --> 00:12:38,276
but guess what?

322
00:12:38,276 --> 00:12:39,726
You know what's better
than the same rates?

323
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,284
Two extra rates.

324
00:12:41,284 --> 00:12:43,458
Maybe you couldn't get the 10.

325
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,541
Maybe your market wasn't there.

326
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:45,682
Maybe your location wasn't there.

327
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:46,957
Maybe your talent wasn't there.

328
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:48,549
Maybe your brand wasn't there.

329
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:50,091
But you know what's better than a dollar?

330
00:12:50,091 --> 00:12:51,133
Two dollars.

331
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:52,498
- Let me ask another question.

332
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:55,282
So, why do you charge
today what you charge?

333
00:12:55,282 --> 00:12:56,901
Where did you get that information?

334
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,928
- Where did I get that information.

335
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:03,515
So, I have reviewed other
photographers that are in my area,

336
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:06,616
and then, I pretty much
reviewed other photographers

337
00:13:06,616 --> 00:13:07,967
that were in my area.

338
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,302
I don't do commercial work.

339
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:11,898
I do strictly portraits.

340
00:13:11,898 --> 00:13:15,297
And my price, where some
people are saying...

341
00:13:15,297 --> 00:13:16,989
Some people say it's too high.

342
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:20,596
Other people say, oh
it was just this much,

343
00:13:20,596 --> 00:13:22,941
so I'm in a middle, a
weird field right now.

344
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:23,841
- Can I ask you a question, Jason?

345
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:24,674
- Yeah.

346
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:25,957
- How many of the people
that said it was too high

347
00:13:25,957 --> 00:13:27,040
still did it?

348
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:31,689
20%, 10%, 50%?

349
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:34,175
- I have people say, "you know,
I saved up for this shoot,

350
00:13:34,175 --> 00:13:37,444
"so this means a lot
for me to come in here."

351
00:13:37,444 --> 00:13:40,258
I've had that, so I don't know how...

352
00:13:40,258 --> 00:13:41,135
- I understand.

353
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:42,238
- I had that situation.

354
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,965
- I want every person to be
right on the edge of saying no,

355
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:49,283
and just deciding to say
yes because you're worth it.

356
00:13:49,283 --> 00:13:51,536
And if you can't figure out
what that sweet price is.

357
00:13:51,536 --> 00:13:52,449
I don't have a price.

358
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:54,908
I don't say my rates are $250.

359
00:13:54,908 --> 00:13:56,884
In some industries you should.

360
00:13:56,884 --> 00:13:59,504
I always want to find out what
the upper limit of my client

361
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:02,062
and what they are going to value me.

362
00:14:02,062 --> 00:14:04,309
If you're a $500 photographer,

363
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:06,171
you will always be a $500 photographer,

364
00:14:06,171 --> 00:14:07,832
and for the client that
says you're gonna be,

365
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:09,882
"oh when I get more
money, I'll come back."

366
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,254
Bullshit.

367
00:14:11,254 --> 00:14:13,481
Because when they find $5,000,

368
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:15,803
are they gonna go to a $500 photographer?

369
00:14:15,803 --> 00:14:17,327
No fucking way.

370
00:14:17,327 --> 00:14:19,187
They're gonna go to the
person who is 10 grand

371
00:14:19,187 --> 00:14:21,201
and they'll try and talk
them into doing it for five.

372
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:22,034
- Jason.

373
00:14:22,034 --> 00:14:22,867
I apologize, go ahead.

374
00:14:22,867 --> 00:14:24,129
- Get in there, get in there.

375
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,613
- I just wanted to say to
you and everybody else,

376
00:14:26,613 --> 00:14:29,196
never say no for the other guy.

377
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:32,664
- I don't know what that means.

378
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:33,497
- I'll explain it.

379
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,564
(audience laughs)

380
00:14:34,564 --> 00:14:35,723
- It sounded good, though.

381
00:14:35,723 --> 00:14:37,112
- It did sound good, right Jason?

382
00:14:37,112 --> 00:14:37,945
- [Chase] It sounded good.

383
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:40,740
- That's why I went
with the dramatic pause.

384
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,180
Here's what I mean by that.

385
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,382
Here's what I mean by that.

386
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:47,886
A lot of people talk themselves
out of a higher price.

387
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:52,395
I can't be $800, 'cause Rick,
who I think is better, is 650.

388
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:54,814
That means you're saying
no for the other person.

389
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:56,681
Keep pushing the envelope.

390
00:14:56,681 --> 00:14:57,963
Let some people say no.

391
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:01,771
Listen, almost everything's
about supply and demand.

392
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:04,211
You don't know what your demand cost is

393
00:15:04,211 --> 00:15:06,328
until you push the envelope.

394
00:15:06,328 --> 00:15:08,118
The way I learned my price in speaking,

395
00:15:08,118 --> 00:15:10,061
when I started getting
put on in 2009 and '10.

396
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:11,409
- Our story's the same on that one.

397
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:12,852
- I just kept asking for more every time

398
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:15,858
and when I got 11 no's
in a row for 50,000,

399
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:17,305
I'm like I guess I'm 40,000.

400
00:15:17,305 --> 00:15:18,178
(audience laughs)

401
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:19,395
but that was a lot more than the 5,000

402
00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:23,797
that I was thrilled to
get for a speech, right?

403
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:27,466
It is detrimental to
not continue to ask more

404
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:30,022
every single time and just keep going on.

405
00:15:30,022 --> 00:15:31,776
Here's the funny part.

406
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:32,609
(imitates phone ringing)

407
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:33,442
Hello, it's Jason.

408
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:34,275
How much is it?

409
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:35,108
800.

410
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:35,941
Oh, that's too much.

411
00:15:35,941 --> 00:15:36,794
700.

412
00:15:36,794 --> 00:15:37,627
Oh, that's too much.

413
00:15:37,627 --> 00:15:40,180
You're just playing a game of chicken.

414
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,055
Going higher, even if they
start seeing you're coming down,

415
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:46,293
you can eventually say no too.

416
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:50,007
You're so in control, yet it's insecurity

417
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:52,094
that's driving down your price.

418
00:15:52,094 --> 00:15:53,543
- I think that's brilliant.

419
00:15:53,543 --> 00:15:54,836
I gotta hop on the backside of that

420
00:15:54,836 --> 00:15:56,861
and say are all of these clients

421
00:15:56,861 --> 00:15:59,975
the same amount good for you?

422
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:01,321
- No, some suck.
- Oh, that's interesting.

423
00:16:01,321 --> 00:16:02,379
- Some suck.

424
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,801
So when the ones that suck
call back at that shitty price

425
00:16:04,801 --> 00:16:08,254
that you're charging, that's
the one where you say,

426
00:16:08,254 --> 00:16:10,488
"oh, man, sorry, my rates have doubled.

427
00:16:10,488 --> 00:16:11,500
"I'm super busy.

428
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,523
"I really appreciate you."

429
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:13,943
You don't say F off.

430
00:16:13,943 --> 00:16:15,691
You say, oh I'm so busy.

431
00:16:15,691 --> 00:16:18,708
I'm sorry, my rates are
double, and 10% of those people

432
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,349
are gonna go, "okay I still need it."

433
00:16:21,349 --> 00:16:22,182
And you're like okay.

434
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,120
That client is becoming an okay client.

435
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,962
- It's the happiness cash ratio.

436
00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:26,943
- Well, question then.

437
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:30,181
I have clients of various financial means.

438
00:16:30,181 --> 00:16:32,167
So, if I have a client who's a millionaire

439
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,898
versus a client who
barely can afford this,

440
00:16:34,898 --> 00:16:39,195
shouldn't I give equal
rates to everyone or no?

441
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:40,724
- First of all--
- No.

442
00:16:40,724 --> 00:16:41,717
(audience laughs)

443
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:42,550
- No?

444
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,801
- Oh, wow, okay.
- Jason, Jason.

445
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:48,743
- And the answer is shouldn't
you according to who?

446
00:16:48,743 --> 00:16:50,881
Who's the judge and the
jury of this shouldn't you?

447
00:16:50,881 --> 00:16:51,907
If you want to-

448
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:54,422
by the way, I say yes.

449
00:16:54,422 --> 00:16:56,757
I've lived my life by
giving different prices

450
00:16:56,757 --> 00:16:58,580
based on people's financial situation

451
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,713
'cause it just makes me feel good.

452
00:17:00,713 --> 00:17:03,357
By the way, I don't think you're wrong.

453
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:06,274
I'm asking everybody based on what?

454
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:08,314
Based on somebody else's opinion?

455
00:17:08,315 --> 00:17:09,214
- That's why I ask him where
he got his information.

456
00:17:09,214 --> 00:17:10,858
Where did he get his pricing information?

457
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:11,691
He got it from the market.

458
00:17:11,692 --> 00:17:13,599
He looked around and said
I'm just like everybody else.

459
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,410
If Tommy's 10 and I'm
two, and Sally's two,

460
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,959
then I'm right here in the middle.

461
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,561
- Jason, if you want to be
Robin Hood, and charge 4x

462
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:24,209
for people that you think are rich,

463
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:29,210
so that you can do right by
certain other people, mazel tov.

464
00:17:29,493 --> 00:17:30,326
- Okay.

465
00:17:30,326 --> 00:17:32,928
(audience laughs)

466
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,609
- Hey, let's give it
up for him, okay guys?

467
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:35,442
- Give it up.

468
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:38,192
(audience claps)

469
00:17:39,762 --> 00:17:41,095
Chase, stand up.

470
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:44,435
- Wait, make sure you're in there.

471
00:17:44,435 --> 00:17:45,949
- We should turn around,
actually, with the crowd.

472
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:47,209
- No, this is good, oh good idea.

473
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:48,042
Let's get the crowd.

474
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:48,875
- I'm a professional photographer.

475
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:49,988
- Yeah, I have no idea
what the fuck I'm doing.

476
00:17:49,988 --> 00:17:51,525
(audience laughs)

477
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:52,837
- Awesome.
- Awesome, thank you guys.

478
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:53,670
- You're welcome.

479
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,503
- One more round of
applause for him, y'all.

480
00:17:54,503 --> 00:17:55,336
Thank you.

481
00:17:55,336 --> 00:17:58,086
(audience claps)

482
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:01,636
- We're gonna hold on just one second.

483
00:18:01,636 --> 00:18:03,691
So, the plan here is actual value,

484
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:06,185
and what I loved about
that is raise your hand

485
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:09,009
if you have had a pricing
thought in your brain

486
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:11,691
that confused you just like that.

487
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:12,747
- Of course.

488
00:18:12,747 --> 00:18:14,377
- That's 90% of the room?

489
00:18:14,377 --> 00:18:15,594
- And 10% liars.

490
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:19,130
(audience laughs)

491
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,021
- All right.

492
00:18:20,021 --> 00:18:22,854
Give us another framework
for how you're thinking,

493
00:18:22,854 --> 00:18:25,714
that you see folks in
the creative community

494
00:18:25,714 --> 00:18:27,380
is not thinking, Gary.

495
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,370
- Attention arbitrage.

496
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,714
So if I can have you leave
with anything about--

497
00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:31,779
- Arbitrage is a bank thing.

498
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:32,612
They don't understand it.

499
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,445
- Understood.

500
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,784
- I'm not saying you,
like we as an industry

501
00:18:35,784 --> 00:18:37,642
- Good news, I don't
understand arbitrage, the word,

502
00:18:37,642 --> 00:18:39,438
either, but I know what I'm trying to say.

503
00:18:39,438 --> 00:18:41,429
- I'm just trying be
like let's keep it real.

504
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:42,776
Let's not use big words.

505
00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:44,512
(audience laughs)

506
00:18:44,512 --> 00:18:47,382
- I failed every english
class I took, so I'm proud

507
00:18:47,382 --> 00:18:50,551
that I get the token as a big word user.

508
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:51,548
Very simple.

509
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,395
There's overpriced and
underpriced attention.

510
00:18:54,395 --> 00:18:56,695
As a collective of the
human race, right now,

511
00:18:56,695 --> 00:18:59,430
there are places where people perceive

512
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,881
a lot of people are paying
attention to, and they're not.

513
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:02,829
Television commercials.

514
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:04,206
Print advertising.

515
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:05,758
Print other things.

516
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:07,802
And there's underpriced attention

517
00:19:07,802 --> 00:19:09,413
that we haven't wrapped our head around,

518
00:19:09,413 --> 00:19:13,397
even big things like Facebook
and Instagram and influencers.

519
00:19:13,397 --> 00:19:17,240
So I think a lot of creatives
aren't being strategic enough

520
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,275
about building up their brand
or awareness for what they do

521
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:21,742
by creating work in places

522
00:19:21,742 --> 00:19:23,526
where people are actually paying attention

523
00:19:23,526 --> 00:19:25,809
versus what they grew up
putting on a pedestal.

524
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:28,568
I'd much rather, and by the
way, this is not even close.

525
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:32,379
I would much rather be on Chase's show

526
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,222
than interviewed in the
Wall Street Journal.

527
00:19:35,222 --> 00:19:36,889
It's not even close.

528
00:19:38,265 --> 00:19:41,237
That's fucking crazy, right?

529
00:19:41,237 --> 00:19:42,070
- Thanks, Gary.

530
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,935
- You're welcome.

531
00:19:42,935 --> 00:19:44,162
(audience laughs)

532
00:19:44,162 --> 00:19:47,742
If you want to sell
something, you're far...

533
00:19:47,742 --> 00:19:51,742
I could be on CNBC, CNN,
Fox, and the Today Show

534
00:19:52,944 --> 00:19:56,037
and I would sell 10 times x my awareness

535
00:19:56,037 --> 00:19:57,667
of whatever I was talking about

536
00:19:57,667 --> 00:20:01,156
than if I just did Malcolm
Gladwell's podcast.

537
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:03,965
There's an amazing arbitrage, a shift,

538
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:07,048
an amazing dynamic, of the attention.

539
00:20:07,951 --> 00:20:11,405
And listen, I get cumbered
by print New York Times,

540
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:15,242
and then some kid puts a
photo of me on Instagram.

541
00:20:15,242 --> 00:20:16,399
I'm living it.

542
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:17,698
I know what's going on.

543
00:20:17,698 --> 00:20:20,630
The attention has shifted
on you at a level-

544
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,493
and when I say you,

545
00:20:21,493 --> 00:20:23,582
I don't mean the
photography creative sector.

546
00:20:23,582 --> 00:20:25,210
I mean us humans.

547
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,016
The attention has shifted so quickly,

548
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:31,820
so extremely that if
you're a practitioner,

549
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,568
if you start thinking
about where it really is,

550
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,793
an amazing unlock for
the things that you want

551
00:20:36,793 --> 00:20:39,991
for you and your family
comes from that world

552
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:42,002
and I'll piggyback on that.

553
00:20:42,002 --> 00:20:44,367
This is very important to me.

554
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:45,969
You may not know what that means.

555
00:20:45,969 --> 00:20:46,802
You're a creative.

556
00:20:46,802 --> 00:20:47,687
You're an artist.

557
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:50,148
But it's scary to me that
you could spend five hours

558
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:52,806
on YouTube and Google searching things,

559
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:55,875
based on what I just said,
and get educated in five hours

560
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,371
that can disproportionately
change your life.

561
00:20:59,371 --> 00:21:00,477
When people ae like I don't get it.

562
00:21:00,477 --> 00:21:01,310
I'm like, cool.

563
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,705
Go google what's happening on Facebook.

564
00:21:02,705 --> 00:21:04,340
How do I get more people
to pay attention to me

565
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,173
on Instagram?

566
00:21:05,173 --> 00:21:07,602
The information is free.

567
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:09,720
You don't have to go to a fucking library.

568
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,189
You could do it in your
underpants at 2 a.m. in your bed

569
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:16,170
and it disproportionately
can change your life.

570
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:20,670
We are so blessed and so
lucky and people are choosing

571
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:24,688
pessimism over optimism and it baffles me.

572
00:21:24,688 --> 00:21:25,521
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

573
00:21:25,521 --> 00:21:26,854
(audience claps)

574
00:21:26,854 --> 00:21:28,854
- Yes.
- You're welcome.

575
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:30,544
- How 'bout you?

576
00:21:30,544 --> 00:21:32,061
Let's reverse it.

577
00:21:32,061 --> 00:21:34,749
As somebody who has deep
contacts into this community,

578
00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:37,056
give me the last six months,
from your perspective,

579
00:21:37,056 --> 00:21:39,492
as a thought leader, as a
practitioner of the craft.

580
00:21:39,492 --> 00:21:40,830
Let's make it very narrow.

581
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,374
I'm gonna buy you a few more seconds here.

582
00:21:42,374 --> 00:21:45,817
In the last six months, what's
been an interesting trend?

583
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:46,846
What's a meme?

584
00:21:46,846 --> 00:21:48,185
What's a subculture?

585
00:21:48,185 --> 00:21:50,014
What's happening?

586
00:21:50,014 --> 00:21:52,504
- What's happening is the
industry is polarizing.

587
00:21:52,504 --> 00:21:54,815
So, there's more photographs being bought

588
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:56,139
and sold now than ever before.

589
00:21:56,139 --> 00:21:56,972
- Amazing.

590
00:21:56,972 --> 00:22:01,395
- Two or three billion photos
get uploaded every day.

591
00:22:01,395 --> 00:22:03,546
The photographers sitting
in this room think

592
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:05,093
that the industry is sinking.

593
00:22:05,093 --> 00:22:07,117
The reality is there's more people buying.

594
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,687
There's more money in the
industry now than ever before

595
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:10,985
and people don't understand it.

596
00:22:10,985 --> 00:22:12,070
They don't know it.

597
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,113
So what's happening is
the middle is falling out.

598
00:22:15,113 --> 00:22:17,821
If you're beige or you're
gray or you're in the middle,

599
00:22:17,821 --> 00:22:19,971
nobody fucking cares.

600
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:23,079
So you either want to be
down here in the market

601
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,915
doing high volume with a lot of stuff

602
00:22:24,915 --> 00:22:28,052
and doing thousand dollar influencer shit

603
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:30,207
with your Instagram and you
can print money that way

604
00:22:30,207 --> 00:22:33,058
or you're super high end,
working for the people who are,

605
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:35,284
if you're trusted, you've been
in this business a long time

606
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:37,321
and you can disproportionately
prove that you can do it,

607
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:39,176
because when someone hires
you, they're signing up.

608
00:22:39,176 --> 00:22:41,712
It's on their ass and if
you can live in that camp,

609
00:22:41,712 --> 00:22:44,769
you can print money, and
if you're in the middle,

610
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:46,398
trying to do the same
shit you did six months

611
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:51,297
or six weeks or two years ago,
you're gonna get eaten alive.

612
00:22:51,297 --> 00:22:53,051
And it's now, and the last six months,

613
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:56,106
it used to be going like this and now it's

614
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:59,541
and anything in here, this is
beige and gray and people...

615
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:02,237
I prescribe being
different, not just better.

616
00:23:02,237 --> 00:23:04,345
So this is a sea of the same.

617
00:23:04,345 --> 00:23:07,012
You gotta do this with intention.

618
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:08,609
Don't just say I don't know who I am.

619
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:09,634
I don't know what I stand for.

620
00:23:09,634 --> 00:23:10,918
I don't know who my customers are.

621
00:23:10,918 --> 00:23:13,420
Figure it out and overindex on that.

622
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,472
- If you feel like you're in the gray,

623
00:23:14,472 --> 00:23:16,942
I've got a little tactical
thing that might help you.

624
00:23:16,942 --> 00:23:18,473
When this happens in markets,

625
00:23:18,473 --> 00:23:20,521
and this is a classic business
thing that always happens.

626
00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:22,433
It's why you're gonna see so
many of your favorite retail

627
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:25,071
stores go out of business
over the next five years.

628
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,909
Toys R Us and Lord and
Taylor's is the preview.

629
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:31,651
Literally 90% of the retailers
you know are gonna be out

630
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:34,974
in the next 10 years because
eCommerce got big enough

631
00:23:34,974 --> 00:23:37,061
that it all broke and
that's what's happened

632
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:39,113
with the supply and demand of photography.

633
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:42,413
Here's an incredibly
optimistic thing to do.

634
00:23:42,413 --> 00:23:44,856
This is exactly the moment
for you to take a step back,

635
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,095
if you feel you're in the
beige, or you're vulnerable,

636
00:23:47,095 --> 00:23:48,604
I've got something really fun.

637
00:23:48,604 --> 00:23:53,604
Take a step back and become
a super narrow niche expert

638
00:23:53,987 --> 00:23:58,570
in a certain genre, A.K.A.
1980 to 1984 Smurf dynamics.

639
00:24:00,556 --> 00:24:02,980
(audience laughs)

640
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,279
And this is gonna be really fun,

641
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:07,740
'cause if you love your craft,
and you have other interests,

642
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,288
this is where you get
real, real, real narrow.

643
00:24:11,288 --> 00:24:13,124
Let me give you some of the super weird.

644
00:24:13,124 --> 00:24:16,791
I take photos of high
school wide receivers.

645
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:19,300
Now, that is narrow.

646
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:22,294
But you have to understand
why it's powerful.

647
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,880
On the human psychology, most parents

648
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,264
think their kids in high
school that played football

649
00:24:27,264 --> 00:24:29,426
are gonna play in the NFL.

650
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,541
They're delirious, right?

651
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:34,034
Which means it's a huge market.

652
00:24:34,034 --> 00:24:36,193
And I know how narrow that is,

653
00:24:36,193 --> 00:24:39,006
but if you love high school football,

654
00:24:39,006 --> 00:24:41,282
if you live in Texas and it's religion,

655
00:24:41,282 --> 00:24:45,305
you will find unbelievable
opportunity when you react

656
00:24:45,305 --> 00:24:48,982
to expansion, you have to contract.

657
00:24:48,982 --> 00:24:50,292
What's amazing is you can contract

658
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:52,042
in something you've always loved.

659
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:52,875
Tea.

660
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:53,708
You love tea.

661
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,352
Go deep into tea.

662
00:24:55,352 --> 00:24:57,286
Take a photo of every tea leaf ever,

663
00:24:57,286 --> 00:24:59,253
from every fucking angle ever.

664
00:24:59,253 --> 00:25:00,768
(audience laughs)

665
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:02,122
I'm telling you, I'm telling you.

666
00:25:02,122 --> 00:25:02,992
I've seen this over and over.

667
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:04,466
This is true pattern recognition.

668
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:06,198
This is not my intuition.

669
00:25:06,198 --> 00:25:09,149
This could be an
incredible keynote for you

670
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:10,939
because you're gonna win twice.

671
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:13,022
You get to be fruitful in your craft

672
00:25:13,022 --> 00:25:14,486
and you get to do it around the thing

673
00:25:14,486 --> 00:25:16,819
that you most narrowly love.

674
00:25:18,098 --> 00:25:18,931
- Spoken.

675
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:19,987
(audience claps)

676
00:25:19,987 --> 00:25:21,304
- It's interesting.

677
00:25:21,304 --> 00:25:23,867
And maybe you hate Instagram today,

678
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:26,480
but Instagram could help you
so much because what you can do

679
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,059
is you can start taking
three photos a day,

680
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:31,550
posting on Instagram and using
10, 15 hashtags around tea,

681
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,538
chamomile, black tea, samavor.

682
00:25:33,538 --> 00:25:35,882
You can do it and people
will start discovering you

683
00:25:35,882 --> 00:25:37,503
and then if you actually put in work

684
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:40,671
to actually make your life
happen and spend another hour

685
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:43,966
going to all the other tea
photos and adding your two cents,

686
00:25:43,966 --> 00:25:46,541
commenting, becoming
part of the community,

687
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:48,865
you will be baffled by what will happen.

688
00:25:48,865 --> 00:25:51,484
All of a sudden, in a six month period,

689
00:25:51,484 --> 00:25:53,590
you've got 11 different
tea companies asking you

690
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,388
to take the official shot

691
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:57,035
that they're putting on their package,

692
00:25:57,035 --> 00:25:58,975
then one of them becomes a big tea brand

693
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:00,338
and you get to live the rest of your life

694
00:26:00,338 --> 00:26:02,537
walking around and seeing your picture.

695
00:26:02,537 --> 00:26:04,362
I mean this is real, what I'm telling you,

696
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:06,148
and notice how interesting it is.

697
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,098
I know you clapped and you
really caught my attention.

698
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:08,967
I appreciate it.

699
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,701
This is where optimism beats pessimism.

700
00:26:11,701 --> 00:26:12,584
Woe is me.

701
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:14,364
All these fuckfaces with a fucking iPhone

702
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,007
have taken everything away from me.

703
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:16,970
(audience laughs)

704
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:21,248
or holy shit, I can take
photos of cocker spaniels

705
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:22,570
for the rest of my fucking life.

706
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,393
(audience laughs)

707
00:26:24,393 --> 00:26:26,031
That is binary.

708
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:29,439
(audience claps)

709
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:30,746
- All right, should we
do another hot seat?

710
00:26:30,746 --> 00:26:31,579
- Yeah.

711
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:32,456
- All right, you can call on it, Gary.

712
00:26:32,456 --> 00:26:35,776
- All right, that lovely lady right there.

713
00:26:35,776 --> 00:26:37,491
(audience laughs)

714
00:26:37,491 --> 00:26:38,324
- Time is short.

715
00:26:38,324 --> 00:26:39,168
Hustle up, we got this.

716
00:26:39,168 --> 00:26:40,001
Come on.

717
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:41,019
Welcome her to the stage, you guys.

718
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:41,852
Come on, let's go.

719
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:44,628
(crowd claps)

720
00:26:44,628 --> 00:26:45,560
I have a gift for you.

721
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,851
- [Woman] Oh, thank you so much.

722
00:26:46,851 --> 00:26:47,771
- Tell us who you are.

723
00:26:47,771 --> 00:26:49,263
- Welcome.
- My name is Nicki, hi.

724
00:26:49,263 --> 00:26:50,096
- Put that thing right up there.

725
00:26:50,096 --> 00:26:51,669
- Yeah, I know, but I'm
giving this to Gary.

726
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:52,502
- Sure, here we go.

727
00:26:52,502 --> 00:26:53,412
Now we've got a trend.

728
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:54,491
(audience laughs)

729
00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:56,207
- I'm the least capable photographer

730
00:26:56,207 --> 00:26:57,402
in this whole fucking place,

731
00:26:57,402 --> 00:26:58,364
(audience laughs)

732
00:26:58,364 --> 00:27:00,670
and I'm taking the video.

733
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,503
Let's do it.

734
00:27:01,503 --> 00:27:02,336
- Okay, my name is Nicki.

735
00:27:02,336 --> 00:27:05,503
I am a West Milford-based, New Jersey.

736
00:27:06,394 --> 00:27:07,227
- Jersey in the house.

737
00:27:07,227 --> 00:27:08,060
- Jersey in the house!

738
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:08,926
(audience cheers)

739
00:27:08,926 --> 00:27:11,732
We are the same age and
I grew up in Old Bridge.

740
00:27:11,732 --> 00:27:13,103
- You're 29?
- Right down the street.

741
00:27:13,103 --> 00:27:14,194
- I know, don't I look great?

742
00:27:14,194 --> 00:27:16,277
(laughs)

743
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,951
I'm really glad that I
got asked to be up here

744
00:27:20,951 --> 00:27:24,631
after that exact question
because this is what I have done.

745
00:27:24,631 --> 00:27:28,182
In the last six months,
I went super narrow.

746
00:27:28,182 --> 00:27:31,272
I am now a yoga portrait photographer.

747
00:27:31,272 --> 00:27:32,184
- Love it.
- Boom.

748
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:33,350
(audience claps)

749
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,221
- How's business?

750
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:35,804
- I would call that narrow.

751
00:27:35,804 --> 00:27:38,228
Super narrow is I take photos of people

752
00:27:38,228 --> 00:27:40,200
with curly blond hair that do yoga.

753
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,498
(Nicki laughing)

754
00:27:41,498 --> 00:27:42,331
I'm just telling you.

755
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:43,164
I'm not kidding.

756
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:43,997
But go ahead.

757
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:44,830
- It's predominantly been women.

758
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,497
- Of course, I've heard.
- Great.

759
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:52,623
- What I have done, because you said

760
00:27:52,623 --> 00:27:56,080
that nobody listens to you (laughing).

761
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,413
I pretty much dropped out
doing my portrait business

762
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,885
I still pick it up if people call me,

763
00:28:03,885 --> 00:28:06,328
but I'm not pursuing it.

764
00:28:06,328 --> 00:28:08,540
- [Gary] Are you charging more now?

765
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,340
- Well this is where I'm at.
- Mistake.

766
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,385
- This is where I'm at because I decided

767
00:28:13,385 --> 00:28:17,218
about a year ago today
that, from reading 10X,

768
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:21,963
that I wanted to do 500 shoots in one year

769
00:28:21,963 --> 00:28:24,713
and I did shoot 372 this morning.

770
00:28:26,365 --> 00:28:27,703
- Awesome.
- Do the work.

771
00:28:27,703 --> 00:28:29,802
(audience claps)

772
00:28:29,802 --> 00:28:30,889
- You better hurry the fuck up

773
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:32,087
because you're running behind.

774
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:34,378
- (laughing) yeah.

775
00:28:34,378 --> 00:28:36,431
- I mean it's almost
November, 372, she's behind.

776
00:28:36,431 --> 00:28:37,878
- I am, I am definitely running behind.

777
00:28:37,878 --> 00:28:39,548
I punted a few weeks.

778
00:28:39,548 --> 00:28:41,925
- You better fucking
get your act together.

779
00:28:41,925 --> 00:28:42,875
And it's the holidays.

780
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:44,361
Fucking Thanksgiving, that week is shot.

781
00:28:44,361 --> 00:28:45,662
- Last two weeks are fucked.
- It's gonna be tough.

782
00:28:45,662 --> 00:28:49,513
- Exactly.
- You better fucking hustle.

783
00:28:49,513 --> 00:28:50,646
- No freebies up here.

784
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:51,479
No freebies.

785
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,489
- Well, that was the problem.

786
00:28:52,489 --> 00:28:53,866
I have been doing freebies.

787
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:55,929
I've been reaching out,
which is another thing.

788
00:28:55,929 --> 00:28:57,834
I'm selling shit on eBay,

789
00:28:57,834 --> 00:28:59,799
so that I can keep the money rolling in.

790
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:03,549
And I am reaching out
to people on Instagram,

791
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:05,394
saying I'll shoot you for free.

792
00:29:05,394 --> 00:29:06,227
I'll shoot you for free.

793
00:29:06,227 --> 00:29:07,060
I'll shoot you for free.

794
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,656
- [Gary] It's happening on the DM.

795
00:29:08,656 --> 00:29:10,564
Going down, keep on sliding in.

796
00:29:10,564 --> 00:29:13,325
- This morning's shoot,
she has 49,000 followers.

797
00:29:13,325 --> 00:29:15,171
- So the thing is...
- The question is...

798
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:17,103
- Now...
- Chase is about to punch you.

799
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:18,408
- [Gary] You need to get to the question.

800
00:29:18,408 --> 00:29:19,432
- (laughs) no, I love you.
- I know, I'm sorry.

801
00:29:19,432 --> 00:29:20,390
- No, you're great.
- That's okay.

802
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,385
- When do I start saying fuck you pay me?

803
00:29:23,385 --> 00:29:24,218
- Hold tight.
- Tomorrow.

804
00:29:24,218 --> 00:29:26,652
- Yeah, yeah, I would say
tomorrow, but here's the thing.

805
00:29:26,652 --> 00:29:28,300
If you're busy doing that thing,

806
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,071
you should start charging
for it immediately.

807
00:29:30,071 --> 00:29:32,128
What else I heard in there,
and this is the thing

808
00:29:32,128 --> 00:29:35,121
that most of your, having
been in your shoes,

809
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:36,804
I know that what you're
saying right now is

810
00:29:36,804 --> 00:29:39,530
yeah, but I make 95% of
my money off weddings.

811
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,860
Should I just shut down
my wedding business?

812
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,660
Nope, and there's a lot of
heads nodding out there,

813
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,013
'cause I wanna do this thing.

814
00:29:45,013 --> 00:29:46,076
- I wanna get known for--
- No.

815
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,098
- I wanna get paid for this thing.

816
00:29:47,098 --> 00:29:47,931
- Yeah, exactly.

817
00:29:47,931 --> 00:29:48,764
I am taking money-

818
00:29:48,764 --> 00:29:50,542
I photographed a preschool last week.

819
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:52,728
I still have the stuff on the side.

820
00:29:52,728 --> 00:29:54,355
I'm not posting that on my Instagram page

821
00:29:54,355 --> 00:29:56,921
because it is specifically for the yoga.

822
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:57,754
- Perfect.

823
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,302
- That's the key right there.

824
00:29:59,302 --> 00:30:02,385
She's not showing pictures of things

825
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:03,800
she doesn't want to get hired to shoot.

826
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,633
- I have other accounts.

827
00:30:04,633 --> 00:30:06,126
I have an account that I have
my travel photography on.

828
00:30:06,126 --> 00:30:07,574
- She's selling in one place.

829
00:30:07,574 --> 00:30:08,920
She's branding in another.

830
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,753
- Right.

831
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:14,927
But my thing is, I'm reaching
out to all these people,

832
00:30:14,927 --> 00:30:17,605
they're finally saying yes,
but now I'm feeling like

833
00:30:17,605 --> 00:30:19,213
I'm starting to get used.

834
00:30:19,213 --> 00:30:21,568
- No, no, no, you're using them.

835
00:30:21,568 --> 00:30:22,907
Be careful.

836
00:30:22,907 --> 00:30:24,736
- This is where it's chasing my head.

837
00:30:24,736 --> 00:30:25,583
- You're using them.

838
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:27,004
You had an agenda.

839
00:30:27,004 --> 00:30:28,305
You had an ambition.

840
00:30:28,305 --> 00:30:29,808
You're trying to build brand.

841
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:31,015
So you reached out to them.

842
00:30:31,015 --> 00:30:32,208
You're using them.

843
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:34,773
Until you say there's a price to it,

844
00:30:34,773 --> 00:30:36,445
they're not taking advantage of you.

845
00:30:36,445 --> 00:30:38,705
They're saying yes to you
taking advantage of them.

846
00:30:38,705 --> 00:30:39,607
- Well, now they call me--

847
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:40,811
- You know how many people
reach out to me like Gary,

848
00:30:40,811 --> 00:30:42,199
I'll shoot you, I'll do this.

849
00:30:42,199 --> 00:30:45,435
You're gonna leverage my
brand to build your business

850
00:30:45,435 --> 00:30:47,348
and that makes me happy.

851
00:30:47,348 --> 00:30:48,948
But I'm not taking advantage of you.

852
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:51,003
- Well, no because now there's companies

853
00:30:51,003 --> 00:30:55,305
that are saying, all right
well... 'cause I was thinking

854
00:30:55,305 --> 00:30:58,638
maybe there's a commercial aspect of it.

855
00:30:59,598 --> 00:31:02,564
So I'll get a yoga
company to send me stuff

856
00:31:02,564 --> 00:31:05,227
or they'll send the model
stuff and I'll photograph them

857
00:31:05,227 --> 00:31:06,641
and then I'll be like, okay, well,

858
00:31:06,641 --> 00:31:08,097
can I work on the next
campaign or I want to do this

859
00:31:08,097 --> 00:31:10,134
and they're like, "no, we
just want your images."

860
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,977
- so that's where that whole--
- Can I tell you something?

861
00:31:11,977 --> 00:31:12,810
- Can I tell you something?

862
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,643
- Go ahead.

863
00:31:13,643 --> 00:31:15,040
- You're in control.

864
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,348
When the yoga company hits you up and says

865
00:31:17,348 --> 00:31:20,299
we'd like to send you a yoga
mat to use in this next thing,

866
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:22,721
you say cool, $1,000.

867
00:31:22,721 --> 00:31:25,508
And when they say fuck you,
you move on to the next one.

868
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,403
- That's what I've been doing.

869
00:31:26,403 --> 00:31:27,236
- Good.

870
00:31:27,236 --> 00:31:28,069
- It's gotten to that point.

871
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:29,018
- Mazel tov.

872
00:31:29,018 --> 00:31:30,851
- This is the thing, though.

873
00:31:30,851 --> 00:31:34,101
How scared are you that
you're never gonna make money?

874
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:34,934
- Very.

875
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:35,767
- Very.

876
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:36,600
- Right.

877
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,440
Anybody else out there ever been scared?

878
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,784
Do you understand we're
all in this shit together.

879
00:31:41,784 --> 00:31:44,007
Her psychology, her challenges are yours,

880
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:45,071
so if you're not paying attention right-

881
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:46,583
that's literally the
function of this thing

882
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:48,527
- we're doing right here.
- Feel like Q & A's the best.

883
00:31:48,527 --> 00:31:49,360
- What's that?

884
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,443
- I feel like Q and A's the best.

885
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:54,924
- I want you to know that
you have, I hear ambiguity.

886
00:31:54,924 --> 00:31:57,070
You don't know how you're gonna get money.

887
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,903
- I don't.
- Exactly.

888
00:31:57,903 --> 00:31:59,553
- And I've been talking
to a couple of my friends

889
00:31:59,553 --> 00:32:01,619
- and I'm like what do I--
- we're here.

890
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,000
(audience laughs)

891
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,959
- We're gonna help.

892
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:06,009
We're gonna help.

893
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,670
- But here's something more
important than us being here.

894
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,246
We're about to leave.

895
00:32:10,246 --> 00:32:12,067
(audience laughs)

896
00:32:12,067 --> 00:32:12,900
- and so the key is--

897
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,080
- I'm about to go home to two kids.

898
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,913
- Correct.

899
00:32:14,913 --> 00:32:15,746
And it's gonna be Tuesday.

900
00:32:15,746 --> 00:32:17,227
And it was nice that you were on the stage

901
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:21,101
with Gary and Chase, but now
it's fuck, what do I do now?

902
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:21,934
It's very simple.

903
00:32:21,934 --> 00:32:23,051
This shit is binary.

904
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:24,741
Either you ask for money or you don't.

905
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:26,979
- I literally came here to ask you that,

906
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:29,554
because I've been doing it
and doing it and doing it

907
00:32:29,554 --> 00:32:30,844
and I'm like, okay, but...

908
00:32:30,844 --> 00:32:32,929
Okay, I get the patience thing.

909
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:34,823
The patience thing took
a very, very long time.

910
00:32:34,823 --> 00:32:35,656
- Can I say something?

911
00:32:35,656 --> 00:32:37,939
The person that can hold
their breath the longest wins.

912
00:32:37,939 --> 00:32:40,938
So if you can afford to
keep doing nursery school

913
00:32:40,938 --> 00:32:44,256
and shursery school and all
that for three or four years,

914
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:47,875
you're gonna continue to build
brand and have more leverage.

915
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:49,675
- Don't light your other business on fire.

916
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:51,792
Just don't talk about it all that much.

917
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:52,625
- Right.

918
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,763
- Sales and branding.

919
00:32:54,763 --> 00:32:56,184
- You're building something over here.

920
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:57,755
You're simmering your shit over here.

921
00:32:57,755 --> 00:32:59,166
I don't care if this is a full time job

922
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:00,607
or it's shooting weddings or whatever.

923
00:33:00,607 --> 00:33:01,478
You want to shoot automotive,

924
00:33:01,478 --> 00:33:04,371
you want to shoot women in yoga pants.

925
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:05,204
I get it.

926
00:33:05,204 --> 00:33:06,062
- Let's talk about a year from now.

927
00:33:06,062 --> 00:33:06,895
- I'm serious!

928
00:33:06,895 --> 00:33:07,728
That is the thing.

929
00:33:07,728 --> 00:33:09,873
You have to be intentional.

930
00:33:09,873 --> 00:33:12,879
My biggest fear is I stand
up to thousands of people

931
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:13,712
eyeball to eyeball.

932
00:33:13,712 --> 00:33:15,716
People don't actually know what they want

933
00:33:15,716 --> 00:33:18,380
or if they know what they
want, they're afraid to say it.

934
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,760
When we leave here today,

935
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,894
you go home and you look in the mirror

936
00:33:20,894 --> 00:33:22,636
and you say exactly what you want to do

937
00:33:22,636 --> 00:33:25,155
and you commit to that
and what I'm hearing,

938
00:33:25,155 --> 00:33:26,516
it could be different,
but what I'm hearing

939
00:33:26,516 --> 00:33:30,229
is that you want to put
images into the marketplace

940
00:33:30,229 --> 00:33:31,770
that are beautiful images of yoga

941
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:34,079
and then you want the
commercial relationship

942
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,125
with the yoga brand.

943
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:35,958
Have you tried that?

944
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:36,791
Do you believe that?

945
00:33:36,791 --> 00:33:38,073
Have you said it over
and over and over again?

946
00:33:38,073 --> 00:33:39,506
And all you need to get paid is--

947
00:33:39,506 --> 00:33:40,339
- Well see my thing is--
- Hold tight.

948
00:33:40,339 --> 00:33:41,864
- All you need to get
paid is by one of them.

949
00:33:41,864 --> 00:33:42,697
- I did though.

950
00:33:42,697 --> 00:33:44,422
- And then the next one that
calls, then you- okay, good.

951
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:45,255
- I did.

952
00:33:45,255 --> 00:33:46,088
- When the next one--
- I did get one.

953
00:33:46,088 --> 00:33:48,845
- When the next one calls, you
tell the next one that calls

954
00:33:48,845 --> 00:33:49,995
that I just did a shoot with these guys

955
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:52,772
and it turned out great
and then you got a price.

956
00:33:52,772 --> 00:33:53,681
And then you've done two.

957
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:54,802
And once you've done
two, you've done five,

958
00:33:54,802 --> 00:33:56,507
and before you know it,
you're the fucking person

959
00:33:56,507 --> 00:33:57,646
who does that for a living.

960
00:33:57,646 --> 00:33:58,729
- Right, and that's the thing.

961
00:33:58,729 --> 00:34:01,490
I'm at this point where
I love the photography.

962
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,606
I know this is it.

963
00:34:02,606 --> 00:34:03,439
This is it.

964
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:06,939
But how am I gonna start getting that door

965
00:34:08,078 --> 00:34:09,594
of the people coming into me

966
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:10,710
and it's like do I do the commercial?

967
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,543
- Patience.

968
00:34:11,543 --> 00:34:12,460
- I know, honey.

969
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,405
I knew you were gonna tell me that.

970
00:34:13,406 --> 00:34:14,358
(audience laughs)

971
00:34:14,358 --> 00:34:15,190
- Well, listen.

972
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,641
Do you want me to tell you the bullshit?

973
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:19,378
Because there's a million
people doing that.

974
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:20,891
- No, I don't need the bullshit.

975
00:34:20,891 --> 00:34:22,083
- Here's the real answer.

976
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,964
It's called fucking patience
and more importantly,

977
00:34:23,964 --> 00:34:24,797
- Well, my thing was--

978
00:34:24,797 --> 00:34:25,630
- Let me say something real quick.

979
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,545
- Okay, go ahead.

980
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:30,746
- It's about not being fancy.

981
00:34:30,746 --> 00:34:32,757
In your situation right now,

982
00:34:32,757 --> 00:34:34,943
if you want to put food on
the table, kids all that.

983
00:34:34,944 --> 00:34:36,234
Get another job too.

984
00:34:36,234 --> 00:34:37,567
Cool, you could.

985
00:34:38,437 --> 00:34:40,014
You could sell stuff.

986
00:34:40,014 --> 00:34:41,052
You could do something else.

987
00:34:41,052 --> 00:34:42,650
What I'm even more scared about

988
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,537
is what happens in 18 months,

989
00:34:44,538 --> 00:34:46,235
when you're rolling a little bit

990
00:34:46,235 --> 00:34:48,199
and you start getting fancy.

991
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,036
I'm most scared in that
one year transition

992
00:34:50,036 --> 00:34:51,266
where you went from the weddings

993
00:34:51,266 --> 00:34:54,109
and now you're doing the yoga
and there's that one year

994
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:56,302
where you decided now you're fancy

995
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,093
and it starts breaking your behavior.

996
00:34:58,093 --> 00:34:59,895
And you start acting like you're somebody.

997
00:34:59,895 --> 00:35:02,080
- I think my biggest
question is me offering...

998
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,233
And I probably already do know the answer.

999
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:05,066
- You know all the answers.

1000
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:06,094
- Yeah, it's all in there.

1001
00:35:06,094 --> 00:35:06,997
- You just want to hear it from us.

1002
00:35:06,997 --> 00:35:07,830
- I do.

1003
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,127
- I actually do.
- I know.

1004
00:35:09,127 --> 00:35:11,757
- I know, but can I say
something real quick,

1005
00:35:11,757 --> 00:35:13,505
and this is for so many of you.

1006
00:35:13,505 --> 00:35:15,401
It's not that you want to hear it from us.

1007
00:35:15,401 --> 00:35:17,738
You're just still buying
time from eating shit.

1008
00:35:17,738 --> 00:35:19,140
(audience laughs)

1009
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,346
People don't want to eat shit.

1010
00:35:21,346 --> 00:35:23,360
You guys don't want to eat shit.

1011
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,467
Do you understand?

1012
00:35:24,467 --> 00:35:25,352
You know the answers.

1013
00:35:25,352 --> 00:35:26,860
You say you want to hear it from me.

1014
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,693
You don't want to hear it from me.

1015
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:29,850
You're still balking at
doing the fucking thing

1016
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,261
that you don't want to do.

1017
00:35:31,261 --> 00:35:33,642
- I'm sure the answer is yes,

1018
00:35:33,642 --> 00:35:36,551
but is all of me still
going out and saying hey,

1019
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,384
I'll shoot you for free.

1020
00:35:37,384 --> 00:35:40,231
Is that eventually
gonna lead to something?

1021
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:42,087
- Maybe you suck shit at what you do.

1022
00:35:42,087 --> 00:35:43,179
(audience laughs)

1023
00:35:43,179 --> 00:35:44,012
- (laughing) I don't know.

1024
00:35:44,012 --> 00:35:45,579
- I'm being, like, I don't know.

1025
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:46,912
I would hope so.

1026
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,937
Under normal circumstances, yes,

1027
00:35:49,937 --> 00:35:53,297
but if you're the worst
photographer ever, no.

1028
00:35:53,297 --> 00:35:54,130
- Here's the thing.

1029
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:57,463
Free or full price, never in the middle.

1030
00:35:59,038 --> 00:36:00,329
Think about that for a second.

1031
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:03,206
Because free, whose terms is that shit on?

1032
00:36:03,206 --> 00:36:04,084
Yours.

1033
00:36:04,084 --> 00:36:05,237
Full price?

1034
00:36:05,237 --> 00:36:06,967
Who's getting paid?

1035
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:08,233
You.

1036
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:10,296
The middle, someone
says what's your price?

1037
00:36:10,296 --> 00:36:11,129
You say five grand.

1038
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:12,366
They say I got 250.

1039
00:36:12,366 --> 00:36:14,897
You say yes to that, that's bad on you.

1040
00:36:14,897 --> 00:36:16,643
- You say I'll do it for free.
- Or...

1041
00:36:16,643 --> 00:36:18,835
- Or you need the 250.

1042
00:36:18,835 --> 00:36:20,417
No, Chase, I think it's an important-

1043
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:21,250
- Money's money.
- Listen.

1044
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,559
- Listen, you're right in
the philosophical standpoint,

1045
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:29,202
but in our all realities, we
have an every day decision

1046
00:36:29,202 --> 00:36:31,561
and some days you have more
leverage than the others.

1047
00:36:31,561 --> 00:36:33,032
Really easy to be a big shot

1048
00:36:33,032 --> 00:36:36,278
when you have 11 people
wanting to give you dollars.

1049
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:38,111
Much tougher to be cool
when it's the only person

1050
00:36:38,111 --> 00:36:41,543
that's reached out to you in three weeks,

1051
00:36:41,543 --> 00:36:45,828
which goes back to what I
care about most, patience.

1052
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:50,828
You're trying to cash in on
good behavior six months in.

1053
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:51,709
- You are.

1054
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,391
- Listen to this and watch this backwards.

1055
00:36:53,391 --> 00:36:55,318
Hey, something good's starting to happen.

1056
00:36:55,318 --> 00:36:57,485
This is what I've been doing
for six or eight months.

1057
00:36:57,485 --> 00:37:00,196
Cool, now when do I get to the glory?

1058
00:37:00,196 --> 00:37:01,029
Never.

1059
00:37:02,658 --> 00:37:06,518
Invest in the process and
then you're fucking there.

1060
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:08,700
If you love photography so much,

1061
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,975
then this seems to be
fucking awesome, right?

1062
00:37:11,975 --> 00:37:14,378
You're trying to get to
the other side too quick

1063
00:37:14,378 --> 00:37:16,863
while you've already
figured out what it takes.

1064
00:37:16,863 --> 00:37:17,696
The end.

1065
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,529
- I'm trying to figure it
out as I'm getting there

1066
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:20,232
and I think that's where
I'm getting tangled.

1067
00:37:20,232 --> 00:37:21,065
- Keep eating shit.

1068
00:37:21,065 --> 00:37:24,506
- Okay, tastes good.
- And build your life.

1069
00:37:24,506 --> 00:37:26,720
- Organize your life so
that you can't eat shit.

1070
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,702
I see people that have studios
and they're hiring people

1071
00:37:28,702 --> 00:37:30,691
and they're like what in the
fuck are you guys thinking?

1072
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:31,921
- Getting fucking fancy around here.

1073
00:37:31,921 --> 00:37:34,143
- It comes from a good place,

1074
00:37:34,143 --> 00:37:36,090
but it's gonna create
a bad outcome for you.

1075
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,232
- It's coming from a shit
place that's called insecurity.

1076
00:37:38,232 --> 00:37:39,535
You don't need shit to look cool.

1077
00:37:39,535 --> 00:37:40,368
- In the last six months,

1078
00:37:40,368 --> 00:37:42,097
I've actually condensed everything down.

1079
00:37:42,097 --> 00:37:44,465
I've gotten rid of a lot of expenses

1080
00:37:44,465 --> 00:37:45,655
and a lot of different things.

1081
00:37:45,655 --> 00:37:47,182
- That's how you win.

1082
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,647
Doesn't matter how much money you make.

1083
00:37:48,647 --> 00:37:51,142
If you're wasting it, you're gonna lose.

1084
00:37:51,142 --> 00:37:52,968
- All right, you feel better?

1085
00:37:52,968 --> 00:37:53,801
- Yes.

1086
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:54,992
- Round of applause for her, you guys.

1087
00:37:54,992 --> 00:37:56,074
(audience claps)

1088
00:37:56,074 --> 00:38:01,074
- Louder, that's a big deal
to get up here and be scared.

1089
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,126
Of course, you got it.

1090
00:38:03,126 --> 00:38:03,959
- Thank you guys.

1091
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:05,485
- Thank you.

1092
00:38:05,485 --> 00:38:07,712
I love this community.

1093
00:38:07,712 --> 00:38:08,926
- Humans, me too.

1094
00:38:08,926 --> 00:38:10,437
(audience laughs)

1095
00:38:10,437 --> 00:38:11,983
This is super human.

1096
00:38:11,983 --> 00:38:14,576
I've spent my time in every industry.

1097
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:16,622
It's all the same shit.

1098
00:38:16,622 --> 00:38:18,346
It's all the same game.

1099
00:38:18,346 --> 00:38:20,082
But in the creative community,

1100
00:38:20,082 --> 00:38:23,543
there's this big backlash
against free work.

1101
00:38:23,543 --> 00:38:24,691
I do free work every day.

1102
00:38:24,691 --> 00:38:27,712
I make tens of millions of dollars a year.

1103
00:38:27,712 --> 00:38:28,642
The end.

1104
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:30,975
Stop being so fucking fancy.

1105
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:33,899
- Next victim?

1106
00:38:33,899 --> 00:38:35,930
(audience laughs)

1107
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:36,891
I'm gonna go you right there.

1108
00:38:36,891 --> 00:38:39,459
Standing up against the post, you sir.

1109
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:40,466
- And I mean that.

1110
00:38:40,466 --> 00:38:41,629
And I mean that in a really big way.

1111
00:38:41,629 --> 00:38:43,935
It makes me really sad 'cause
it's such a great craft

1112
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:47,536
to have, but because you don't
have as much business sense,

1113
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:49,482
you know, theoretically,
which is not true,

1114
00:38:49,482 --> 00:38:51,101
but often you start bashing

1115
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:53,628
against the business part of this.

1116
00:38:53,628 --> 00:38:57,219
If you're such a fucking
artist, do it for free.

1117
00:38:57,219 --> 00:38:59,134
'cause when you start
charging, you're in business.

1118
00:38:59,134 --> 00:39:02,468
You better wrap your
fucking head around that.

1119
00:39:02,468 --> 00:39:04,117
And this is business dynamics.

1120
00:39:04,117 --> 00:39:05,831
You have a supply and demand issue.

1121
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:07,691
There's an unlimited
amount of talent out there

1122
00:39:07,691 --> 00:39:09,616
and technology's caught up and has armed

1123
00:39:09,616 --> 00:39:12,073
every eight year old
with real fucking ammo.

1124
00:39:12,073 --> 00:39:13,482
Sorry.

1125
00:39:13,482 --> 00:39:15,488
Sorry, but that's what happened.

1126
00:39:15,488 --> 00:39:19,354
And until you fucking grasp
that and really get there,

1127
00:39:19,354 --> 00:39:21,295
sorry, but that's the reality.

1128
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:23,032
So own it and go on the offense

1129
00:39:23,032 --> 00:39:24,498
instead of fucking sitting on your couch

1130
00:39:24,498 --> 00:39:26,359
and dwelling every day.

1131
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:27,929
- Guys, let's welcome
Richard to the stage.

1132
00:39:27,929 --> 00:39:30,679
(audience claps)

1133
00:39:33,432 --> 00:39:34,967
- Thank you guys for picking me.

1134
00:39:34,967 --> 00:39:36,078
I appreciate it.

1135
00:39:36,078 --> 00:39:37,465
Gary, I've been doing the patience thing.

1136
00:39:37,465 --> 00:39:39,980
I've been podcasting for 11 years.

1137
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,260
Content creating, lot of sleepless nights.

1138
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,927
Haven't made a dime.

1139
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,870
The thing is I want to support my family,

1140
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,051
keep doing my nine to five.

1141
00:39:51,051 --> 00:39:52,585
And I've been doing it.

1142
00:39:52,585 --> 00:39:54,634
Posting on Instagram in
between my lunch breaks.

1143
00:39:54,634 --> 00:39:58,193
Writing posts for my site on
my phone, et cetera et cetera.

1144
00:39:58,193 --> 00:39:59,355
- [Gary] What do you want to happen?

1145
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,443
Let's start there.

1146
00:40:00,443 --> 00:40:02,202
What's making it for you?

1147
00:40:02,202 --> 00:40:04,577
- All I want to do is review products,

1148
00:40:04,577 --> 00:40:06,235
write about video games and podcast.

1149
00:40:06,235 --> 00:40:07,068
- [Gary] And get paid.

1150
00:40:07,068 --> 00:40:07,901
- And get paid.

1151
00:40:07,901 --> 00:40:08,734
- How much have you reached out

1152
00:40:08,734 --> 00:40:10,926
to ask people for money for doing it?

1153
00:40:10,926 --> 00:40:12,270
- I've been reaching out here and there.

1154
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,690
- Let's be really honest here.

1155
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,907
Let's take advantage of this moment.

1156
00:40:15,907 --> 00:40:18,281
How many hours in the last 11 years,

1157
00:40:18,281 --> 00:40:20,103
and I'm asking you hours,

1158
00:40:20,103 --> 00:40:24,843
have you spent Emailing
Activision, Emailing Sony,

1159
00:40:24,843 --> 00:40:27,486
Emailing and saying I
would like you to pay me

1160
00:40:27,486 --> 00:40:29,115
to review this product.

1161
00:40:29,115 --> 00:40:30,282
- At least 50.

1162
00:40:31,198 --> 00:40:32,031
- [Gary] Hours.

1163
00:40:32,031 --> 00:40:32,864
- Yeah.

1164
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:33,697
- [Gary] In 11 years?

1165
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:34,530
- Probably a little more than that.

1166
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,363
- Okay.
- Give or take.

1167
00:40:35,363 --> 00:40:37,392
- [Gary] And you've gotten mainly no's.

1168
00:40:37,392 --> 00:40:39,598
- Some yeses, but not consistent

1169
00:40:39,598 --> 00:40:41,926
and that's where the problem comes from.

1170
00:40:41,926 --> 00:40:44,259
It's playing the long
game, playing patient.

1171
00:40:44,259 --> 00:40:46,940
Doing a lot of free
content, giving it all away.

1172
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,553
- And Richard, real quick for everybody.

1173
00:40:48,553 --> 00:40:50,836
There's unlimited stories like this.

1174
00:40:50,836 --> 00:40:52,675
It comes down to two variables.

1175
00:40:52,675 --> 00:40:55,048
Either A, you're not good enough

1176
00:40:55,048 --> 00:40:56,696
that the market wants to pay

1177
00:40:56,696 --> 00:40:58,923
because there's a lot
of reviews, which hurts.

1178
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,523
Or B, which has been stunningly often,

1179
00:41:01,523 --> 00:41:04,514
you're not the person that
should be the business person.

1180
00:41:04,514 --> 00:41:06,498
You should be the creative.

1181
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:08,996
What runs through my mind
is in your circle of life,

1182
00:41:08,996 --> 00:41:12,570
is there some homey that could
be your 50% business partner

1183
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,616
where she or he may spend all the time

1184
00:41:14,616 --> 00:41:16,397
trying to monetize the creative

1185
00:41:16,397 --> 00:41:19,178
and 50 cents of a million
is a hell of a lot better

1186
00:41:19,178 --> 00:41:20,696
than zero of zero.

1187
00:41:20,696 --> 00:41:22,118
- One is better than zero,
like they always say.

1188
00:41:22,118 --> 00:41:23,122
- That's right.
- It's true.

1189
00:41:23,122 --> 00:41:24,709
- That's the thing.

1190
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:26,193
I have people who have been helping me

1191
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:27,305
on the site for years.

1192
00:41:27,305 --> 00:41:29,238
I built a podcast network from it,

1193
00:41:29,238 --> 00:41:32,170
doing shows for other guys,
other people that are on there

1194
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,739
giving other people opportunities.

1195
00:41:33,739 --> 00:41:35,250
- Have you charged them?

1196
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,952
Maybe you're a platform
that springs other talent

1197
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,624
instead of being the talent.

1198
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:41,351
Maybe you're a B to B business
instead of a B to C business.

1199
00:41:41,351 --> 00:41:42,513
- I haven't charged them

1200
00:41:42,513 --> 00:41:44,339
just because I was giving
people opportunities.

1201
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:45,588
They started writing, they're like, hey,

1202
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:47,671
I want to do the podcast thing like you.

1203
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,290
I gave them the opportunity.

1204
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:51,160
- [Gary] Have any of them
gone off and done real things?

1205
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,234
- No, they're still grinding alongside me.

1206
00:41:53,234 --> 00:41:56,457
Some guys hit 100 shows
already, 200 shows, 500 shows.

1207
00:41:56,457 --> 00:41:57,755
That's the thing.

1208
00:41:57,755 --> 00:42:01,196
I feel like I'm spinning
my wheels a little bit.

1209
00:42:01,196 --> 00:42:02,922
- So if nobody was here,

1210
00:42:02,922 --> 00:42:05,027
and you were with yourself in the mirror,

1211
00:42:05,027 --> 00:42:07,696
it was that moment to say
why hasn't it happened?

1212
00:42:07,696 --> 00:42:10,183
What would be the answer, for real?

1213
00:42:10,183 --> 00:42:11,507
Don't bullshit me.

1214
00:42:11,507 --> 00:42:13,477
- I think it's just
spreading myself too thin,

1215
00:42:13,477 --> 00:42:14,530
more so than anything.

1216
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,589
- So stop doing that.

1217
00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:18,287
- Have you tried doing--
- No, hold on.

1218
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:19,120
- Chase, I apologize.

1219
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,203
- Keep going.

1220
00:42:22,045 --> 00:42:24,671
- You just like being spread thin?

1221
00:42:24,671 --> 00:42:28,371
- No, it's not a question
of it's by choice.

1222
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:30,788
It's because it's kinda forced.

1223
00:42:30,788 --> 00:42:33,718
- Everything's by choice, brother.

1224
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,445
- I'll give you personal
context and I'll explain.

1225
00:42:35,445 --> 00:42:37,092
- Please.

1226
00:42:37,092 --> 00:42:38,613
- I've been raising my two sisters.

1227
00:42:38,613 --> 00:42:39,763
They're both handicapped.

1228
00:42:39,763 --> 00:42:42,189
I've been doing it for the last 17 years.

1229
00:42:42,189 --> 00:42:43,755
Both of them are special needs.

1230
00:42:43,755 --> 00:42:44,966
- Doing that.
- That's real.

1231
00:42:44,966 --> 00:42:46,173
- Juggling a nine to five job.

1232
00:42:46,173 --> 00:42:48,618
Being a husband, doing all that,

1233
00:42:48,618 --> 00:42:51,733
plus trying to grow a business,
spreading yourself thin.

1234
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:54,609
I work a 40 hour workweek.

1235
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:56,778
My wife spends most
time sleeping by herself

1236
00:42:56,778 --> 00:42:58,870
because I'm downstairs doing the grind.

1237
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:02,291
Go to bed at 5 a.m., wake up at 9 a.m.

1238
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:03,290
Go to work.

1239
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,118
- Work 'til seven o'clock.
- Richard.

1240
00:43:05,118 --> 00:43:05,951
- That's what I mean.

1241
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:08,033
- Richard, this is not fun for me to say,

1242
00:43:08,033 --> 00:43:09,384
but I want you to win.

1243
00:43:09,384 --> 00:43:10,635
- Appreciate it.

1244
00:43:10,635 --> 00:43:12,258
- There's a very fine line

1245
00:43:12,258 --> 00:43:15,062
between perseverance and delusion.

1246
00:43:15,062 --> 00:43:16,833
It's very thin.

1247
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:18,880
11 years and your circumstance.

1248
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,945
First of all, it sounds
like you can even tell,

1249
00:43:21,945 --> 00:43:23,777
you like what you're doing.

1250
00:43:23,777 --> 00:43:24,737
- I love what I do.

1251
00:43:24,737 --> 00:43:27,812
- Right, you might just
have to settle into that.

1252
00:43:27,812 --> 00:43:29,728
Because when I am auditing this,

1253
00:43:29,728 --> 00:43:31,109
and I don't know everything, right,

1254
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,705
but even on quick intuition,

1255
00:43:32,705 --> 00:43:35,702
you might be better off
making money in some other way

1256
00:43:35,702 --> 00:43:38,021
that you're not seeing, but there's a love

1257
00:43:38,021 --> 00:43:40,565
to the consumer facing
output that you're making

1258
00:43:40,565 --> 00:43:42,817
that you may want to not let go of.

1259
00:43:42,817 --> 00:43:46,161
You might be able to make
80K at a B to B business

1260
00:43:46,161 --> 00:43:47,558
on what you're doing,

1261
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:48,874
'cause it seems like you
have a lot of experience

1262
00:43:48,874 --> 00:43:51,018
and you could easily, pretty quickly,

1263
00:43:51,018 --> 00:43:53,125
start charging people $500 a month

1264
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:54,772
teaching them 11 years of experience.

1265
00:43:54,772 --> 00:43:55,605
That's super valuable.

1266
00:43:55,605 --> 00:43:58,673
Times 80 people, it starts
becoming a real business.

1267
00:43:58,673 --> 00:44:01,393
You just might like the thrill
of putting out an output

1268
00:44:01,393 --> 00:44:03,679
into the world and I want to say this,

1269
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:05,869
'cause we've done a lot of business talk.

1270
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:07,969
It's funny for me 'cause
we're in a creative place.

1271
00:44:07,969 --> 00:44:11,177
In business world, I spend
all my time saying fuck money.

1272
00:44:11,177 --> 00:44:13,559
Make a little less and
do something you like,

1273
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:14,515
'cause you're miserable.

1274
00:44:14,515 --> 00:44:15,348
You know how many people I know

1275
00:44:15,348 --> 00:44:17,423
make a million dollars a year
that fucking hate their lives?

1276
00:44:17,423 --> 00:44:18,322
A lot.

1277
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,155
- Oh, I'm not greedy.

1278
00:44:19,155 --> 00:44:20,925
I just want to be able to make enough

1279
00:44:20,925 --> 00:44:22,265
to provide for my family.

1280
00:44:22,265 --> 00:44:23,098
- Respect.

1281
00:44:23,098 --> 00:44:25,564
- Live okay and just be a provider.

1282
00:44:25,564 --> 00:44:26,397
That's it.

1283
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:29,051
Be able to provide value
for my audience while happy.

1284
00:44:29,051 --> 00:44:31,299
- I think you're putting your
talent in the wrong place.

1285
00:44:31,299 --> 00:44:32,132
I have a funny feeling.

1286
00:44:32,132 --> 00:44:33,350
You know my flip challenge.

1287
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:35,101
I have a funny feeling
you'll make way more money

1288
00:44:35,101 --> 00:44:36,765
if you wake up at 6 a.m. on weekends

1289
00:44:36,765 --> 00:44:39,702
and go and garage sale and
flea market and goodwill stores

1290
00:44:39,702 --> 00:44:42,990
and buy underpriced
equipment in this industry

1291
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,234
and flip it 'cause you actually know

1292
00:44:44,234 --> 00:44:46,395
the value of all this shit.

1293
00:44:46,395 --> 00:44:47,994
You're gonna have to make a choice

1294
00:44:47,994 --> 00:44:49,722
between happiness and dollars

1295
00:44:49,722 --> 00:44:51,772
because 11 years of data
are staring you in the face

1296
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,836
saying what you're doing isn't working.

1297
00:44:53,836 --> 00:44:57,104
- Yeah, I mean, it's
growing, but it's you know.

1298
00:44:57,104 --> 00:44:58,860
Not a snail's pace, but not--

1299
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,262
- 11 years is a long fucking time.

1300
00:45:01,262 --> 00:45:03,311
So you've gotta decide,

1301
00:45:03,311 --> 00:45:05,319
if you're not gonna be the personal brand,

1302
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:06,679
like what do you want to do now?

1303
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:10,365
Do you want to accept it
because the love is so awesome

1304
00:45:10,365 --> 00:45:13,964
or do you want to transfer
the skills and the knowledge

1305
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:17,160
into something that's a
more monetizable reality?

1306
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:17,993
And that's up to you.

1307
00:45:17,993 --> 00:45:19,469
There's no right answer.

1308
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:21,859
Maybe those nights are a lot of fun.

1309
00:45:21,859 --> 00:45:25,866
I got lucky that business
savvy was my thing

1310
00:45:25,866 --> 00:45:27,224
but when I was getting D's and F's

1311
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,173
and college was the only way out,

1312
00:45:29,173 --> 00:45:31,144
I got shit on my entire childhood,

1313
00:45:31,144 --> 00:45:32,911
'cause it wasn't good or cool.

1314
00:45:32,911 --> 00:45:34,416
But I chose it.

1315
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:35,946
I was willing to be considered a loser

1316
00:45:35,946 --> 00:45:39,732
for up to 20 years old because
I just couldn't breathe

1317
00:45:39,732 --> 00:45:42,080
by not- the only thing
on earth I wanted to do

1318
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,913
was buy and sell shit.

1319
00:45:45,046 --> 00:45:47,122
- I find people that
trip up on three things.

1320
00:45:47,122 --> 00:45:48,580
One of three things and I'm
borrowing from a friend,

1321
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,413
Tony Robbins.

1322
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,676
State, story, and strategy.

1323
00:45:51,676 --> 00:45:54,310
You usually are F'ed up on
one of these three things.

1324
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:56,585
Mostly I find it's the state.

1325
00:45:56,585 --> 00:45:58,871
If you can't have control
of your state of mind.

1326
00:45:58,871 --> 00:46:00,903
If you're not healthy,
taking care of yourself,

1327
00:46:00,903 --> 00:46:03,481
in a good spot, it's very,
very hard for yourself

1328
00:46:03,481 --> 00:46:05,169
to tell yourself a good story,

1329
00:46:05,169 --> 00:46:06,268
because this is required.

1330
00:46:06,268 --> 00:46:08,928
I'm good enough, I'm enough,
it's who I am right now

1331
00:46:08,928 --> 00:46:10,150
to go out there and put the work.

1332
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:10,983
I'm valuable.

1333
00:46:10,983 --> 00:46:12,070
I can do this.

1334
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:13,307
These are stories.

1335
00:46:13,307 --> 00:46:15,459
And if you're story is this is impossible,

1336
00:46:15,459 --> 00:46:17,406
I'll never get there,
then you go back to state.

1337
00:46:17,406 --> 00:46:19,475
Fix the state first 'cause
you have to have a good state.

1338
00:46:19,475 --> 00:46:21,023
Tell yourself a good story.

1339
00:46:21,023 --> 00:46:23,821
When you get the story part
figured out, then the strategy.

1340
00:46:23,821 --> 00:46:25,142
I hear you oscillating a little bit

1341
00:46:25,142 --> 00:46:27,960
between story and strategy
'cause I hear a little bit

1342
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,426
of I want to do this.

1343
00:46:29,426 --> 00:46:31,871
11 years, bro, is a lot.

1344
00:46:31,871 --> 00:46:33,647
Was it Nicole who was just up here?

1345
00:46:33,647 --> 00:46:35,276
Six months and she's getting impatient.

1346
00:46:35,276 --> 00:46:37,157
You've been doing it 11 years.

1347
00:46:37,157 --> 00:46:37,990
I love that.

1348
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:38,823
I love that.

1349
00:46:38,823 --> 00:46:40,136
It tells me you've got
a pretty good state.

1350
00:46:40,136 --> 00:46:41,841
Your story is good.

1351
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:45,039
It's a little bit flimsy
because it's been 11 years now.

1352
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:48,098
What I hear you not innovating
on is your strategy.

1353
00:46:48,098 --> 00:46:49,194
You're trying to do the same thing

1354
00:46:49,194 --> 00:46:51,948
and what Gary's telling you
is how can I make money?

1355
00:46:51,948 --> 00:46:52,781
Is it here?

1356
00:46:52,781 --> 00:46:53,614
Is it here?

1357
00:46:53,614 --> 00:46:54,447
is it here?

1358
00:46:54,447 --> 00:46:55,280
Am I charging people for my MCM?

1359
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,565
Am I reselling the gear?

1360
00:46:56,565 --> 00:46:59,008
How can I make the living
or the life or at first,

1361
00:46:59,008 --> 00:47:01,019
just some money in that world?

1362
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:02,390
It seems like you've
been doing the same thing

1363
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:03,432
and that's, you know,--

1364
00:47:03,432 --> 00:47:04,265
- The money's there.

1365
00:47:04,265 --> 00:47:05,179
It's been small, like I said.

1366
00:47:05,179 --> 00:47:06,262
Just small here and there.

1367
00:47:06,262 --> 00:47:07,095
People want to buy ad space.

1368
00:47:07,095 --> 00:47:08,669
- Real quick Richard, that
means the money's not there.

1369
00:47:08,669 --> 00:47:10,373
- Right, it's not sustainable.

1370
00:47:10,373 --> 00:47:11,288
- Small money for 11 years is not--

1371
00:47:11,288 --> 00:47:12,121
- Start with that.

1372
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,079
Start with that.

1373
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:14,037
The money's there but it's small.

1374
00:47:14,037 --> 00:47:14,870
No it's not.

1375
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:17,160
The money's not there to the
satisfaction that you want.

1376
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,117
Some people want 50,000 a
year, some want 5 million.

1377
00:47:19,117 --> 00:47:20,214
The money's not there.

1378
00:47:20,214 --> 00:47:21,447
And that's okay.

1379
00:47:21,447 --> 00:47:24,005
Listen, being an entrepreneur

1380
00:47:24,005 --> 00:47:26,411
right now has tricked everybody.

1381
00:47:26,411 --> 00:47:27,976
It feels like anybody can do it.

1382
00:47:27,976 --> 00:47:29,276
It's super cool.

1383
00:47:29,276 --> 00:47:33,481
It's super hard to build
a successful business.

1384
00:47:33,481 --> 00:47:35,699
- Absolutely.
- It's super hard.

1385
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:37,955
- It's an actual skill.

1386
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:39,761
Like, the end.

1387
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:42,283
It comes natural to
some, just like singing.

1388
00:47:42,283 --> 00:47:43,924
Just like having an eye for a photo.

1389
00:47:43,924 --> 00:47:45,745
I don't see a fucking
blue jay and be like,

1390
00:47:45,745 --> 00:47:46,909
oh, there's an angle
(imitates camera shutter).

1391
00:47:46,909 --> 00:47:48,841
(audience laughs)

1392
00:47:48,841 --> 00:47:50,356
I see a blue jay, I'm
like fuck that blue jay.

1393
00:47:50,356 --> 00:47:52,558
(audience laughs)

1394
00:47:52,558 --> 00:47:54,286
These are skills.

1395
00:47:54,286 --> 00:47:56,038
These are skills.

1396
00:47:56,038 --> 00:47:57,906
Richard, the data shows you

1397
00:47:57,906 --> 00:48:00,260
that from a business building standpoint,

1398
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:01,487
you may not have that skill.

1399
00:48:01,487 --> 00:48:04,713
Maybe it's yet, maybe it's
ever, we don't know you.

1400
00:48:04,713 --> 00:48:08,721
But the definition of insanity
is doing the same shit

1401
00:48:08,721 --> 00:48:11,290
over and over and expecting
a different result.

1402
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:14,161
You've gotta do something different, bro.

1403
00:48:14,161 --> 00:48:14,996
- Is this clear?

1404
00:48:14,996 --> 00:48:16,946
What are you taking away
from this conversation?

1405
00:48:16,946 --> 00:48:21,316
- Well, I think that I've
gone too wide, like Gary says.

1406
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:25,066
I've got to go deeper on one aspect--

1407
00:48:25,066 --> 00:48:27,712
- Do you just have a lot of
creative, technical interests?

1408
00:48:27,712 --> 00:48:30,846
- Well, what's happening is
you're putting out podcasts,

1409
00:48:30,846 --> 00:48:31,679
I've been doing that.

1410
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:32,841
Doing the YouTube thing.

1411
00:48:32,841 --> 00:48:34,158
Doing the Facebook thing.

1412
00:48:34,158 --> 00:48:35,012
Doing the Instagram thing.

1413
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,235
- But the thing is are you making

1414
00:48:36,235 --> 00:48:37,776
a different video every day on YouTube,

1415
00:48:37,776 --> 00:48:40,321
one is about vacuum cleaners,
the other is about technology,

1416
00:48:40,321 --> 00:48:43,101
- The third one is--
- No, no, I stay in my lane.

1417
00:48:43,101 --> 00:48:46,678
- It's tech products,
games, video games, phones.

1418
00:48:46,678 --> 00:48:47,944
- Super saturated.

1419
00:48:47,944 --> 00:48:49,749
Unlimited supply.

1420
00:48:49,749 --> 00:48:51,577
Super competitive.

1421
00:48:51,577 --> 00:48:52,744
Do me a favor.

1422
00:48:53,633 --> 00:48:55,579
How much money on this side project

1423
00:48:55,579 --> 00:48:56,790
would you like to make in a year?

1424
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:57,623
Don't bullshit me.

1425
00:48:57,623 --> 00:48:58,871
What would get you like, holy shit.

1426
00:48:58,871 --> 00:49:01,469
Not like, I'm fucking buying islands,

1427
00:49:01,469 --> 00:49:03,153
(audience laughs)

1428
00:49:03,153 --> 00:49:04,672
but like this really matters to me.

1429
00:49:04,672 --> 00:49:07,429
This extra 5K, 50, give me a number.

1430
00:49:07,429 --> 00:49:09,623
- As separate from my regular income?

1431
00:49:09,623 --> 00:49:10,784
- Correct.

1432
00:49:10,784 --> 00:49:14,330
The thing that would make
you say fuck, this made it.

1433
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:16,803
- I'd like to at least
make $10,000 a month.

1434
00:49:16,803 --> 00:49:19,934
15,000, not being greedy, just enough.

1435
00:49:19,934 --> 00:49:20,767
- That's fucking greedy.

1436
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:22,668
Let me help you understand
why that's greedy.

1437
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,852
You said 10 to 15,000 on the side.

1438
00:49:24,852 --> 00:49:28,234
Do you understand where
120,000 to $180,000 a year

1439
00:49:28,234 --> 00:49:30,362
puts you in the scheme of 100%

1440
00:49:30,362 --> 00:49:32,078
of the people in America's income?

1441
00:49:32,078 --> 00:49:34,729
- Yeah, on a world scale.
- So you're being greedy.

1442
00:49:34,729 --> 00:49:36,383
- And I need people to understand that.

1443
00:49:36,383 --> 00:49:38,633
People don't get it, right?

1444
00:49:39,695 --> 00:49:41,250
It's a real number.

1445
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:43,233
We need to define greedy.

1446
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:45,322
If you're making six figures a year,

1447
00:49:45,322 --> 00:49:47,117
you're making a lot of money by standards.

1448
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,064
And I know New York might have
different things than that,

1449
00:49:49,064 --> 00:49:51,162
but you have to wrap your head around.

1450
00:49:51,162 --> 00:49:53,763
I don't think we sit and
really understand the data.

1451
00:49:53,763 --> 00:49:58,763
$440,000 a year puts you
at the bottom of the 1%.

1452
00:49:58,806 --> 00:50:02,889
The top 1% of everybody
make 440,000 and up.

1453
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,488
But everybody starts talking like,

1454
00:50:06,488 --> 00:50:07,736
"if I don't make a million."

1455
00:50:07,736 --> 00:50:09,320
We're not grounding ourselves.

1456
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:14,153
Making $180,000 a year as a
side hustle is greedy as fuck.

1457
00:50:15,075 --> 00:50:16,249
(audience laughs)

1458
00:50:16,249 --> 00:50:17,171
I'm being serious.

1459
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:19,254
Now, by the way, you're
entitled to be greedy.

1460
00:50:19,254 --> 00:50:21,923
Be greedy, my man, but I need you

1461
00:50:21,923 --> 00:50:24,033
to wrap your head around that first.

1462
00:50:24,033 --> 00:50:26,887
Look, I think that you have to understand,

1463
00:50:26,887 --> 00:50:30,073
you have to be in the sales
and business business,

1464
00:50:30,073 --> 00:50:31,231
not in the content business.

1465
00:50:31,231 --> 00:50:33,147
I have a feeling that you
have a very big interest

1466
00:50:33,147 --> 00:50:35,222
in all these things,
so it's a lot more fun

1467
00:50:35,222 --> 00:50:37,612
to make the content and do the content

1468
00:50:37,612 --> 00:50:39,791
than it is to run the business.

1469
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:41,588
- Yeah, definitely more labor intensive.

1470
00:50:41,588 --> 00:50:43,099
- No, Not labor intensive.

1471
00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:45,144
It's what you like more.

1472
00:50:45,144 --> 00:50:47,335
- Brother, you know what I like to do?

1473
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:50,746
Slip into everybody's
DM and business develop.

1474
00:50:50,746 --> 00:50:52,301
Let's making a fucking deal.

1475
00:50:52,301 --> 00:50:55,410
I make the content as the secondary thing.

1476
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:56,431
I don't like that.

1477
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:57,607
Why do you think I don't fucking edit

1478
00:50:57,607 --> 00:50:59,546
Niko or Babin or D-Rock?

1479
00:50:59,546 --> 00:51:02,796
I don't give a fuck about the lighting.

1480
00:51:04,967 --> 00:51:08,482
I give a shit about the
game, the hustle, selling,

1481
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,201
biz-deving, bringing value,

1482
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:12,542
understanding how it brings
back in brand, building a brand,

1483
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:16,141
leveraging, strategizing, where
am I going, selling, doing,

1484
00:51:16,141 --> 00:51:17,777
sneaker drop, planet of the apps,

1485
00:51:17,777 --> 00:51:20,985
duh-duh-duh-duh-duh
business, business, business.

1486
00:51:20,985 --> 00:51:23,077
That's my hustle.

1487
00:51:23,077 --> 00:51:26,284
That's why I make money 'cause
I like the business part.

1488
00:51:26,284 --> 00:51:28,381
You might be making tremendous content.

1489
00:51:28,381 --> 00:51:31,427
You just don't have the
business chops, bro.

1490
00:51:31,427 --> 00:51:34,173
Get a fucking partner, Richard,

1491
00:51:34,173 --> 00:51:35,554
'cause you can't do it.

1492
00:51:35,554 --> 00:51:37,544
- Nope, definitely not.

1493
00:51:37,544 --> 00:51:38,755
- Round of applause for Richard.

1494
00:51:38,755 --> 00:51:41,255
(crowd claps)

1495
00:51:44,221 --> 00:51:45,721
- And there's nothing
wrong with that, man.

1496
00:51:45,721 --> 00:51:47,943
That's when you make that
mindset, then you fucking win.

1497
00:51:47,943 --> 00:51:49,684
Get the business partner.

1498
00:51:49,684 --> 00:51:50,517
- [Richard] You know what it is?

1499
00:51:50,517 --> 00:51:53,843
- It's like--
- what's the podcast?

1500
00:51:53,843 --> 00:51:55,622
- My podcast is the Variant Issue.

1501
00:51:55,622 --> 00:51:57,408
My website is RageWorks.net.

1502
00:51:57,408 --> 00:51:58,241
- We're gonna say it one more time.

1503
00:51:58,241 --> 00:51:59,074
- Feel free to check it out.

1504
00:51:59,074 --> 00:51:59,907
- RageWorks.net.
- One more time.

1505
00:51:59,907 --> 00:52:01,446
- RageWorks.net is the site,

1506
00:52:01,446 --> 00:52:03,869
and the podcast that I do
right now is the Variant Issue.

1507
00:52:03,869 --> 00:52:04,901
It's a comic book podcast,

1508
00:52:04,901 --> 00:52:07,033
but we have a full
podcast network of shows.

1509
00:52:07,033 --> 00:52:09,628
Sports, movies, video
games, we got it all.

1510
00:52:09,628 --> 00:52:11,420
- You're about to get 400 subscribers.

1511
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,253
- Guys.

1512
00:52:12,253 --> 00:52:13,825
- Richard, Richard.
- Thanks, guys.

1513
00:52:13,825 --> 00:52:15,432
- You have to understand.

1514
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:17,138
Richard, where are you from?

1515
00:52:17,138 --> 00:52:18,221
- Oh, here in New York City.

1516
00:52:18,221 --> 00:52:19,199
I'm from Queens.

1517
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:24,199
- If I was his business partner
on his comic book podcast,

1518
00:52:24,606 --> 00:52:26,721
we would make a million dollars a year.

1519
00:52:26,721 --> 00:52:28,275
(audience laughs)

1520
00:52:28,275 --> 00:52:29,829
- I'm being serious.
- Do it!

1521
00:52:29,829 --> 00:52:30,836
I can't.

1522
00:52:30,836 --> 00:52:32,769
I got my own shit, fuck you guys.

1523
00:52:32,769 --> 00:52:34,421
(audience laughs)

1524
00:52:34,421 --> 00:52:36,421
You're welcome, brother.

1525
00:52:37,786 --> 00:52:38,953
- Thanks, man.

1526
00:52:41,916 --> 00:52:44,860
You guys, you know how
to get his attention.

1527
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,769
- DM him.
- It's true.

1528
00:52:46,769 --> 00:52:49,940
- He's GaryVee pretty much
everywhere, with two E's.

1529
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,004
I don't know why you did that, bud.

1530
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:53,300
- Worst branding move of my career.

1531
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,345
Two silent E's?

1532
00:52:54,345 --> 00:52:55,318
What the fuck?

1533
00:52:55,318 --> 00:52:57,270
(audience laughs)

1534
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:58,695
He's Gary, I'm Chase.

1535
00:52:58,695 --> 00:52:59,528
We're out of time.

1536
00:52:59,528 --> 00:53:01,516
I want to say thank you guys
very much for coming out.

1537
00:53:01,516 --> 00:53:02,349
- [Woman] Join me in thanking them.

1538
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:05,099
(audience claps)

1539
00:53:06,005 --> 00:53:07,443
- Give it up for him, come on.

1540
00:53:07,443 --> 00:53:09,027
- This guy.

1541
00:53:09,027 --> 00:53:10,485
Thank you guys.

1542
00:53:10,485 --> 00:53:11,318
Thank you.

1543
00:53:13,403 --> 00:53:15,716
Jordan really wants to
know your two cents.

1544
00:53:15,716 --> 00:53:16,549
Right, Jordan?

1545
00:53:16,549 --> 00:53:18,829
- What's your two cents?

1546
00:53:18,829 --> 00:00:00,000
(rock music)
