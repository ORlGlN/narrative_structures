1
00:00:02,772 --> 00:00:04,857
- It's good to be back.

2
00:00:04,857 --> 00:00:07,857
â™« We're unstoppable

3
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:11,640
- Back in action.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,444
We're supposed to play
basketball at 5:30 this morning.

5
00:00:14,444 --> 00:00:15,929
Gym was closed.

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:17,179
I would've been at the gym.

7
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:19,506
Tyler, you should kiss AJ in the face.

8
00:00:19,506 --> 00:00:21,744
You were already up
here, weren't you, DRock?

9
00:00:21,744 --> 00:00:23,346
- I was back here.
- Really good month.

10
00:00:23,346 --> 00:00:25,090
Got a ton of family time.

11
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,494
Hey, Wine Library, it's
Gary Vaynerchuk, former host

12
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,960
of Wine Library TV, and Sasha Vaynerchuk.

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,711
Took a little trip to Boston.

14
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:35,892
Yo, I'm about to go give
this talk, but real quick,

15
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:38,398
if you want to join the
Wine Club, swipe up.

16
00:00:38,398 --> 00:00:40,551
Quick little keynote in Germany.

17
00:00:40,551 --> 00:00:42,726
Just gave a great talk,
felt really good about it.

18
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:45,587
Little bit more of serious demeanor.

19
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,681
Real fun.

20
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:49,886
Got to take my sister Liz on that trip.

21
00:00:49,886 --> 00:00:51,619
- [Man] We can't show her,
this is Gary's sister.

22
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:52,452
- Caught up is Ryssa.

23
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:53,513
Who's tryna disappear.

24
00:00:53,513 --> 00:00:54,346
Ryssa, don't be scared.

25
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,720
There she is.

26
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,733
Has been with Vayner for
the last five or six years.

27
00:00:57,733 --> 00:00:59,110
Ryssa, six years?

28
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,168
All right, she's gone.

29
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:01,910
Now, I'm gettin' a quick haircut.

30
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,884
(popping)

31
00:01:02,884 --> 00:01:06,458
Now, that I got my haircut,
now, now I'm rejuvenated.

32
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,875
I think one of the things
that has separated me

33
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,966
in the business world my
entire 20-year career,

34
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:13,795
sorry, Brandon, I'm kinda
talkin' to YouTube right now,

35
00:01:13,795 --> 00:01:15,518
so stick with me, but
this is for you, too.

36
00:01:15,518 --> 00:01:18,266
It's just fuckin' about
the things that matter.

37
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:20,646
Everybody has 40 hours, 80
hours in a week, depending

38
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:21,719
on how you roll.

39
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,334
That's why I'm so obsessed
with new customers.

40
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:24,687
That's why I'm so obsessed with 900.

41
00:01:24,687 --> 00:01:27,268
Every time I step away from
a situation, whether at Wine

42
00:01:27,268 --> 00:01:29,806
Library, Team Gary, at Vayner
Media, one of the things

43
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:32,631
that always spike to the top
of the list, prioritizing

44
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:34,234
things that matter.

45
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:36,529
Things that impact your business.

46
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,815
Buying and selling and customer
service is what impacts

47
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:43,226
Wine Library, not just
following the process.

48
00:01:43,226 --> 00:01:44,913
Everybody's so (bleeping) oriented.

49
00:01:44,913 --> 00:01:46,782
Everybody's religious to the process.

50
00:01:46,782 --> 00:01:48,495
Do the things that matter.

51
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:50,691
Do the things that drive impact.

52
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:54,565
Do the things that actually
will change your business.

53
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:57,104
Patience is equally tied
in to things that matter

54
00:01:57,104 --> 00:01:59,965
a lot of times, because the
things that matter are hard,

55
00:01:59,965 --> 00:02:02,032
so it takes time.

56
00:02:02,032 --> 00:02:04,167
That's why I have time to
sit down with my employees.

57
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:07,654
I think those are the
things that actually matter.

58
00:02:07,654 --> 00:02:09,068
Hey.
- Hey, what's up, man?

59
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:10,131
- Hey man, sorry.

60
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:10,965
- Do you have a minute, I
could give you a gift that's

61
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:13,461
something that I got from
the 2017 flip challenge?

62
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:14,588
- Yes.

63
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:16,282
- Listen, I wonder if
you have a just a second

64
00:02:16,282 --> 00:02:17,637
for a New Jersey hustler.

65
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,846
- Real fast, like 30 seconds.

66
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:21,109
- [Man] One minute,
thirty-seven seconds later.

67
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:22,634
- Love it, man.

68
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:23,622
Take care of yourself.
- Peace and love.

69
00:02:23,622 --> 00:02:24,688
- [Gary] Stay well.

70
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:25,521
- I'll see you at the super tasting.

71
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:26,724
- I'll see you there.

72
00:02:26,724 --> 00:02:27,884
Do anything interesting?

73
00:02:27,884 --> 00:02:29,546
- I started playing Pickleball.

74
00:02:29,546 --> 00:02:30,430
- You did?

75
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,331
- What is Pickleball.

76
00:02:31,331 --> 00:02:33,998
(ball whacking)

77
00:02:38,337 --> 00:02:39,303
(yelling)

78
00:02:39,303 --> 00:02:40,611
- God, people are really all about that.

79
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:41,778
(popping)

80
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:42,905
Where are you putting out content now?

81
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:44,179
Instagram?

82
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:46,164
- Facebook and YouTube.
- Instagram, Facebook.

83
00:02:46,164 --> 00:02:47,538
- So, it was really fun.

84
00:02:47,538 --> 00:02:50,085
YouTube, I'm really
tryna go deeper for you

85
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:51,455
in this new iteration.

86
00:02:51,455 --> 00:02:54,352
I realized, ah, document
over create was such

87
00:02:54,352 --> 00:02:57,190
a breakthrough for so many of
you, but there is a middle.

88
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,435
Besides interviewing somebody,
Q and A is the easiest way

89
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:03,331
to create content, instead
of creating it yourself.

90
00:03:03,331 --> 00:03:04,164
- [Woman] Yeah.

91
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:05,290
- You know the whole
document versus create?

92
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,161
Well, maybe you guys don't
wanna be reality TV stars

93
00:03:07,161 --> 00:03:08,681
and document your whole day.

94
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:10,723
Just 'cause documenting
versus creating works

95
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,081
for so many of you.

96
00:03:12,081 --> 00:03:13,642
My whole thing is just start.

97
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:15,688
And what holds everybody back is creation.

98
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:16,893
- [Woman] Mm.

99
00:03:16,893 --> 00:03:18,480
- Which is why documenting
over create because such

100
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,528
a big thing.

101
00:03:19,528 --> 00:03:22,149
And I think the thing that
make you is a Q and A format.

102
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:23,448
It's not on you.

103
00:03:23,448 --> 00:03:25,611
But, you need to just pick
phone numbers, and be like,

104
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:27,207
"Hey, Karen, from Kansas
City, what's your question?"

105
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,162
- Awesome.
- Awesome.

106
00:03:28,162 --> 00:03:28,995
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

107
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:30,163
- Guys, I hope it was a good experience.

108
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:32,457
This is the year to wear one Vaynerchuk.

109
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:33,958
Thanks, man, thank you, so much.

110
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:34,975
Continued success.
- Thank you guys.

111
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:36,204
- Hit me up anytime.

112
00:03:36,204 --> 00:03:39,189
Q and A is a huge way to go.

113
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:41,609
An absolute breakthrough
that we're gonna expand on.

114
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:42,762
- Big fan!

115
00:03:42,762 --> 00:03:46,602
Just started following you.
- Thank you, brother.

116
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:47,660
What's up, fellas?

117
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,660
- What's up.

118
00:03:49,816 --> 00:03:51,943
(beeping)

119
00:03:51,943 --> 00:03:52,776
- Hey.
- I'm Marcus.

120
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:53,609
- How you doin', Marcus?
- I'm gonna be

121
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:54,442
your photographer, man, let's do it.

122
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,275
- Gary, how's it going?

123
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:56,245
Michael.
- Michael, such a pleasure.

124
00:03:56,245 --> 00:03:57,078
Hi.
- Hi.

125
00:03:57,078 --> 00:03:58,850
Marissa.
- Marissa, such a pleasure.

126
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,459
Cool.

127
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:01,592
- Don't have to worry about
changing these at all.

128
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:02,425
- Okay.

129
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:03,258
- So, we'll get you in those.

130
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:04,246
And then, we're doing just a couple

131
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:05,857
shirt changes throughout, kay?

132
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:06,690
- Yep.

133
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,271
So, I'm gonna take some
photos here, video for this

134
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:13,030
Shopify thing that I'm
doing with my (bleeping).

135
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,863
Super excited about it.

136
00:04:13,863 --> 00:04:15,947
I'm not even sure I'm allowed
to talk about it, now.

137
00:04:15,947 --> 00:04:18,687
Beep where I said what it
is, but excited about it.

138
00:04:18,687 --> 00:04:21,015
Trying to get my modeling game up.

139
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:23,182
(popping)

140
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,183
So, back to Vayner?

141
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,016
- [Man] Yep.

142
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:27,849
- Back to Vayner.

143
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:30,927
Super excited about this
contest I'm a part of.

144
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:32,891
Got a quick phone call right now.

145
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:34,450
I'm probably two minutes late.

146
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,679
Two minutes late?

147
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:37,825
- Yeah, you'll be four.

148
00:04:37,825 --> 00:04:38,680
- Four.

149
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,513
Gotta go.

150
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:40,954
Puttin' all the pieces together.

151
00:04:40,954 --> 00:04:42,467
My boy Russ.

152
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:43,861
Fuckin' fired up.

153
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:45,117
I fuckin' love his music.

154
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:47,268
You, Me is probably...

155
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:49,713
Hey, Alexa, can you play You, Me by Russ?

156
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:50,630
Hey, Alexa?

157
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:54,596
What's the matter with my Alexa?

158
00:04:54,596 --> 00:04:56,261
- [Alexa] I can't find You, Me by Russ.

159
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:57,796
- [Man] It'll be on YouTube.

160
00:04:57,796 --> 00:04:59,051
- What the (bleeping), Alexa?

161
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:01,016
(chattering)

162
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:03,941
- We're on a good street here,
but there was a bad street

163
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:04,774
that went here.

164
00:05:04,774 --> 00:05:05,968
Until next time, thank you so much.

165
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:08,804
- But you're gonna be,
this is like an official,

166
00:05:08,804 --> 00:05:09,693
but kind of like, but you're still like

167
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:10,897
gonna be here, right?

168
00:05:10,897 --> 00:05:11,730
- Yeah.

169
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,702
- Okay, we'll see you later.

170
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:13,535
It's important.

171
00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:14,921
I'm gonna be there anyway.

172
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:16,325
I might as well get some show time.

173
00:05:16,325 --> 00:05:17,541
So, what is this, bro?

174
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,752
Oh, this is not the juice prep.

175
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:19,585
What is this?

176
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:20,472
- That's a protein shake.

177
00:05:20,472 --> 00:05:21,305
- [Man] Hold on.

178
00:05:21,305 --> 00:05:24,027
- [Gary] Dude, that was such
a big loss, I'm stunned.

179
00:05:24,027 --> 00:05:25,320
That's a lot.

180
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,508
- I told you that was gonna happen, too.

181
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:27,658
- [Man] What happened, you lost?

182
00:05:27,658 --> 00:05:29,122
- [Gary] I've gained so much weight.

183
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:32,943
But then last night, in
one day of fasting, I lost

184
00:05:32,943 --> 00:05:33,776
the most weight I've ever--

185
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:34,609
- Five pounds.

186
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:35,442
- Yeah.

187
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:36,275
- How is that?

188
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:37,108
Is that all right?

189
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:37,941
- Yeah.
- Good.

190
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:38,774
- It's fucking great.
- Okay, good.

191
00:05:38,774 --> 00:05:41,357
(upbeat music)

192
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:49,482
- We're at a client event.

193
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,995
Fun to see the team and
clients get together.

194
00:05:51,995 --> 00:05:53,708
A lot of times, we can't
show you guys a lot

195
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:54,827
of client stuff.

196
00:05:54,827 --> 00:05:57,162
I think it's a real indication
of a lot of the stuff

197
00:05:57,162 --> 00:06:00,382
you guys haven't been able
to see behind the scenes.

198
00:06:00,382 --> 00:06:02,725
I'm always laughing,
we're always laughing,

199
00:06:02,725 --> 00:06:05,340
because so much of my
day is Vayner Media, yet,

200
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,014
because so much of that is
confidential, I can't show

201
00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:10,932
you guys the day in, day out
grind of client services,

202
00:06:10,932 --> 00:06:13,629
building an organization,
having 800 employees,

203
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:17,491
having 50 clients, a
$100,000,000 plus media company.

204
00:06:17,491 --> 00:06:18,803
A lot of shit.

205
00:06:18,803 --> 00:06:20,851
But I'm glad we get to
show you that today,

206
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:22,620
especially kinda being on
the bounce back episode.

207
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,114
I always tell you guys
watch what I'm doing,

208
00:06:24,114 --> 00:06:25,307
not what I'm saying.

209
00:06:25,307 --> 00:06:27,465
If I'm posting a lot
on Instagram, matters.

210
00:06:27,465 --> 00:06:28,958
If I'm focused on my podcast, matters.

211
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:32,197
If I'm DMing at scale, matters.

212
00:06:32,197 --> 00:06:34,531
This is a nice way to
narrate what I've been trying

213
00:06:34,531 --> 00:06:38,698
to get you to do all along,
which is watch me and why.

214
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:50,571
- [Man] I might get fucked.

215
00:06:50,571 --> 00:00:00,000
- Why, what happened?
