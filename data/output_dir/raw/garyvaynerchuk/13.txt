1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,866
(phone ringing)

2
00:00:08,405 --> 00:00:11,420
- [Jen] Okay, so I took the
challenge just to catch you up,

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,360
I took the challenge.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,420
You were on James Altucher's webcast,

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,500
you put it out there, and I took it.

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,380
Thank you for the kick in the butt.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,460
It's been a total game-changer for me.

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,990
- Go figure.

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,910
- [Jen] Did you get a bunch of takers?

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,870
- Yes, I think we did.

11
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,610
I'm, like, actually scared
that I made that claim,

12
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,580
'cause I don't know
what's actually out there

13
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,770
of people that actually
deserve, I owe podcasts to.

14
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,970
So I'm gonna be scared for
this to show up on the vlog,

15
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,830
'cause now everyone's like,
"No, I took the challenge, too!"

16
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,730
You will represent
everybody, I'm gonna tell,

17
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:44,900
I'm much busier than James,

18
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,479
so I think James has to do the rest.

19
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:48,312
- [Jen] Okay, all right.

20
00:00:48,312 --> 00:00:50,395
Well, I'll tell him that.

21
00:00:51,337 --> 00:00:54,380
So, this led me to other things,

22
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,890
so after this, I was like,

23
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:56,840
"Wow, I really like this.

24
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,708
"I really like this medium."

25
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:03,430
I started doing flash briefings because

26
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,280
I found these guys that are basically like

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,070
the Libsyn of flash briefings,

28
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,690
where it takes one minute to get it up,

29
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:14,100
and then I read your chapter
in your book last night

30
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,500
in Crushing It all about,

31
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,390
you're calling it Voice-First.

32
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,860
Are you gonna use, is that term for, like,

33
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,870
flash briefings or own voice?

34
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,130
- That to me, look,

35
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,590
I think voice is kind
of the term I'm using

36
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,480
for podcasting and flash
briefings and Google

37
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,880
and Apple HomePod

38
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,030
and all the stuff that's
coming with voice.

39
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,223
- [Jen] And

40
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,473
to

41
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,240
think Pod is gonna let
us do briefings as well?

42
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,290
- Oh, yeah, I mean,

43
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,210
Home, Apple, and Google and
Amazon, all these people,

44
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,300
they're businesses to create a platform,

45
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,370
then let people build on top of it,

46
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,180
and then make a percentage of the action.

47
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,640
- [Jen] Who do you think's gonna win?

48
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,940
- No clue, could care less.

49
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,620
- [Jen] Okay, okay.

50
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,243
Let's see.

51
00:02:02,243 --> 00:02:03,076
I also wanna ask you,

52
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:05,846
so, before this podcast,
I was very nervous,

53
00:02:05,846 --> 00:02:08,110
and I was telling my friend,
"Like, I'm really nervous."

54
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,680
Then I said, "But I just have to remember

55
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,370
"that you're just a human being,

56
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,670
"and you put on your
pants one leg at a time,"

57
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,503
and I thought--

58
00:02:14,503 --> 00:02:16,730
- I actually put my
pants two legs at a time.

59
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,240
I jump into my pants.

60
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,550
- [Jen] That's exactly what he said!

61
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,900
He was like, "I think he
jumps into his pants."

62
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,525
But, then, that got me thinking.

63
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:27,020
What do you do in the morning?

64
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,780
- I wake up, I grab my
phone, I go take a poop.

65
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,660
I make sure nothing's on fire
in the world, of my world.

66
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,740
You know, my biggest thing, look.

67
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,010
When you're the CEO of a
thing, it's your fault.

68
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,700
You're the last line of defense,

69
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,610
and so, that's the tough
spot and the fun spot.

70
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,960
Really, my morning is
really interesting, right?

71
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,910
Like, it's funny.

72
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,410
I can actually break down my morning.

73
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,600
The first thought that
runs through my mind is,

74
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,920
"Am I tired?"

75
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,830
Like, "Did I get the sleep that
I needed today to go hard?"

76
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,440
And the good news is,

77
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,050
I'm in a good place nine out of 10 times.

78
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,270
And then, the one time that I'm not,

79
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,670
that I'm like, "Oh, I
hope that my workout today

80
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,630
"is gonna wake me up or
make me feel better."

81
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,160
I love that workout now,

82
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,610
because whereas I used to not have that

83
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,430
and struggled through
the first couple hours,

84
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,560
and then my adrenaline would kick in,

85
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,920
now, usually, it's very rare for me

86
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,100
to be tired and go through a workout

87
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,750
and not be ready for the day, right?

88
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,080
But the biggest thing I
do is I check on fires.

89
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,290
I make sure nothing happened in London.

90
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,590
Don't forget, it's five
or six hours ahead of me,

91
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,240
so even when I wake up, it's six.

92
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,110
They're already well into their day,

93
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,740
and there could be a problem.

94
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,370
And overnight in LA, right?

95
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,330
If I go to sleep at midnight,
it's still only nine there.

96
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,880
Clients are still doing things.

97
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,060
I make sure there's no problems.

98
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,310
- [Jen] What are you doing right now?

99
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,970
- I'm rolling a bat on my lower left back

100
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,860
because I'm fixing my lower
left back muscle issues

101
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,520
and tissue quality,

102
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,830
and it's been a very weird
couple weeks for my team

103
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,210
watching me do all sorts of
weird things with my back.

104
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,960
But it's really good.

105
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,240
For everybody who's watching
right now, tissue quality,

106
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,100
I don't know if people know this.

107
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,740
Your brain protects you

108
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,320
from your most inefficient
physical attributes

109
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,920
and creates huge inefficiencies
by protecting you.

110
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,079
I've realized how limited
I was in my rotation

111
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,789
and bending and stretching.

112
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,550
And it's not about yoga and massages.

113
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,380
This is, like, real fuckin' tissue work.

114
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,340
You gotta really do it.

115
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,860
But it's been amazing, and I'm getting,

116
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,530
I've had a bad back for, like, 25 years,

117
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,420
and I'm this close, I'm in
the final pieces right now,

118
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,790
which is why I'm taking
this huge piece of wood,

119
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,780
it's a half a baseball bat,

120
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,780
and, like, ramming it into
my back, ramming my back.

121
00:04:46,923 --> 00:04:48,550
- [Jen] Where did you get this idea?

122
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,796
Did someone recommend it to you,

123
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:50,629
or do you just thought,

124
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:52,598
"This looks like something
that would work?"

125
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:54,608
- No, my trainer, Jordan,

126
00:04:54,608 --> 00:04:57,440
we roll on a hard ball, a lacrosse ball.

127
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,240
We have a stick.

128
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,750
This is not something he recommends,

129
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,500
this is just, I know this is working,

130
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,280
'cause I'm beating up the muscle.

131
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,890
I can feel what's happening.

132
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,793
It's amazing.

133
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,110
- [Jen] Back to your morning
routine for just a second.

134
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,540
Do you think that you're a natural,

135
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,030
okay, I wanna know how long it takes you

136
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,970
to reach for your phone,

137
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,680
and do you stay in bed
and read your tweets,

138
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,040
or are you up immediately,

139
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,770
and if you didn't have to get up early,

140
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,420
would you naturally be a morning
person or a night person?

141
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,430
- If I didn't have to wake up early,

142
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,820
I'd be naturally a night person.

143
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,850
I grab the phone, and I never lay in bed.

144
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,930
I'm up, I grab the phone,

145
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,931
I go get a drink of water
or go to the bathroom,

146
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:38,433
I'm usually, after I wake up,

147
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:40,910
I'm out of bed within seconds.

148
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,330
Usually because I try to
maximize sleep, so, I gotta go.

149
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,170
I've gone to the extreme of,

150
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,950
I've got a workout in four minutes,

151
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,590
like, I've gotta go to the
bathroom, brush my teeth,

152
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,500
put on gym clothes and get downstairs.

153
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,220
I keep it tight.

154
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,900
I would naturally be a night person.

155
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,840
I like to get work done at
midnight, one, two, three.

156
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,480
I don't like the morning.

157
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,820
I wake up way earlier than I used to.

158
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,730
There was a time when I was
such an extreme night person,

159
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,740
building Wine Library and go
to sleep at three or four,

160
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,690
and not get into Wine
Library until eleven.

161
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,680
That happened for, like, a year.

162
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,260
That's how extreme I went.

163
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,010
But now I get up at six or
seven, and that's how I roll.

164
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,420
- [Jen] Okay.

165
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,900
I also wanna ask you,

166
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,660
we get the sense, all the
people who love and adore you,

167
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,220
and maybe the people, even, who don't,

168
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,700
that we really know you because

169
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,100
you know, you're everywhere.

170
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,006
I really do feel like we do
know you, to some degree.

171
00:06:36,006 --> 00:06:37,290
- You do, yes.

172
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:41,840
- [Jen] What would we be
surprised to know about you?

173
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,320
- Well, you know nothing about my family,

174
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,344
you don't know anything
about my family life.

175
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:47,010
- [Jen] That's true, you
really don't talk about that.

176
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:51,370
- No, I mean, like, nothing
about my kids or my wife.

177
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,730
I spend very little on that.

178
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,930
We keep that private, so you
guys don't know that part.

179
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,370
I mean, I think the part that most people

180
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,620
don't know about me is all of you,

181
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,010
anybody that likes or dislikes
me, but more likes me,

182
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,220
has to keep a percentage to themselves

183
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,810
to keep them protected from me
not letting them down, right?

184
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,810
When someone admires or likes somebody,

185
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,210
there's a protective
mechanism that everyone has,

186
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:19,960
which is, "Man, I really hope
he's like that in real life."

187
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,640
It's been really, really,
Gavin, what about you?

188
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,690
That happened, right?

189
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:26,900
- [Gavin] I wasn't paying attention.

190
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,180
- Did you, when you first
started working here,

191
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,090
there was a part of you like,

192
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,980
"Oh, I hope he's that real
in real life," like, right?

193
00:07:35,883 --> 00:07:36,990
And you didn't have the same dynamic,

194
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,190
'cause I was in a different place.

195
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,370
Nonetheless, I think the biggest thing

196
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,620
that people don't know about me

197
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,040
is that I think I'm even nicer
in real life than I project.

198
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,995
You agree, right?

199
00:07:47,995 --> 00:07:49,610
- [Gavin] I mean, 'cause
I see you every day.

200
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,460
- Right, 'cause you see the
real stuff that I can't show

201
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,610
where I'm being really nice,

202
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,190
but it's inappropriate for me to show it,

203
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,990
'cause it may make the other
person look a little weird.

204
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,370
- [Jen] Well, that's
like the perfect lead-in

205
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,340
to this question that
I'm dying to ask you,

206
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,010
or just, I want to mention,

207
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,720
because it really,

208
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,330
I saw this the other day where you said

209
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,840
that you're in this unique position

210
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,650
where you have crossed the chasm into

211
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,310
being cool for the younger people.

212
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,870
My 17-year-old son is

213
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,627
you know, completely--

214
00:08:19,627 --> 00:08:20,460
- He agrees.

215
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,860
- [Jen] Hangs on your every word.

216
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,570
I have to quote it exactly,
because it was so good.

217
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,150
You said, "If I can achieve
making self-awareness

218
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,059
"and patience and gratitude and empathy

219
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:34,599
"cool characteristics of an alpha male,

220
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,120
"I will have made a real impact."

221
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,030
And I thought, God, that is, like,

222
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,919
for all of the moms and dads
that are probably so mad at you

223
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,720
that their kids are changing
their minds about college,

224
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,800
you probably get just as
many love letters or more

225
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,980
after a statement like that.

226
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,421
But then, I'm, like,
can we really do that?

227
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:56,840
What would it take to really
make those things cool

228
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,500
without it just being, like, a good quote,

229
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,380
you know what I mean?

230
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,820
- Yeah, I mean, I think I'm doing it.

231
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,470
With me, my quotes come after
I've already done something.

232
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,640
I would have never had the audacity

233
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,610
to say something that ludicrous

234
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,640
if I hadn't started seeing
it actually start to happen.

235
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:14,360
- [Jen] It's amazing, it's amazing.

236
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,830
- It is amazing.

237
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,030
I really think it's very special

238
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,110
when somebody comes along
and is a great communicator

239
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,120
and can move people's
minds and does it for good.

240
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,950
'Cause some do it for
good, some do it for bad,

241
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,870
and some never realize they can do it.

242
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,240
Think about how excited I am

243
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,780
about both your 17-year-old son and you.

244
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,100
For your 17-year-old son,

245
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,080
I'm gonna create a new paradigm of cool,

246
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,310
and hopefully that will work.

247
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,850
And for you,

248
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,725
I inspired you to do,

249
00:09:47,725 --> 00:09:50,990
and now you're finding out
something that you're doing

250
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,710
that you enjoy and you may be good at it.

251
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,700
That's incredible.

252
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,770
- [Jen] Yeah, thank you.

253
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,740
- It's cool, listen.

254
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,200
I talk about it as if it's
not even me living it,

255
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,711
because it's almost too
heady for me to, like,

256
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:06,010
I'm being serious right now.

257
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,000
I try not to overthink it

258
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,990
because it becomes a little daunting

259
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,820
if you realize you're sitting
on a superpower, right?

260
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,309
I try to

261
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:15,860
take it for what it is.

262
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,490
The truth is, I actually
think it's a bigger indication

263
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,840
of my parents and my
environment than it is on me,

264
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,660
so I don't get big-headed about it.

265
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,450
I know my intent is to do the best I can.

266
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,930
I don't feel daunted
by the responsibility,

267
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,150
I don't feel like it's my,

268
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,356
I don't think I'm that special,

269
00:10:31,356 --> 00:10:34,010
that I have to change the world.

270
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,242
But, I'm more than interested in trying.

271
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:38,840
- [Jen] (laughs) I love it.

272
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,160
I would imagine that,

273
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,520
if you did think about it too hard,

274
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,490
it would get kind of like, scary,

275
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,090
or, I don't know, maybe it
would feel like a burden?

276
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:51,400
You say that, I mean,

277
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,150
and you teach us to,

278
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:58,900
really, we just should care
immensely about everything,

279
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,850
but not give a crap about what people say.

280
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,880
But I wonder, don't you
ever get your feelings hurt?

281
00:11:07,804 --> 00:11:09,554
- I get my feelings hurt every day.

282
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:11,474
- [Jen] What's that?

283
00:11:11,474 --> 00:11:14,880
- I get my feelings hurt every
day in, like, a fake way.

284
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,690
I'm a human,

285
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,430
I'm just not very emotional
when it comes to this

286
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,260
because I understand the score.

287
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,720
I'm unbelievably emotional,
I'm completely unemotional.

288
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,990
I think I have this great balance

289
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,480
that's coming from
extreme characteristics.

290
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:34,440
I mean,

291
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,260
there was a engagement
I had today on Twitter

292
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,530
where two guys in Europe
or somewhere not in the US,

293
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,920
I kinda quickly glanced,

294
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,840
who I think were from
the advertising industry

295
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,220
were making fun of me.

296
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,400
Like, one of 'em put a
picture of me where it says,

297
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,010
"Hustle your fuckin' face off,"

298
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,620
and he said something
to the degree of like,

299
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,370
"This is an actual quote.

300
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,670
"Can you fuckin' believe this guy?"

301
00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:00,580
And his buddy, or a similar-thinking
guy jumped in and said,

302
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,100
I think he said, "Try to find a quote

303
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,020
"that's more ludicrous
than this kind of thing."

304
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,320
And then his buddy found one,

305
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,500
but I don't think that
one was a real quote,

306
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,720
'cause the other one was real.

307
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,800
But they just took a picture of me

308
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,630
and put some ridiculous
quote that I think I did say.

309
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,360
Bottom line is, they were bantering.

310
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,580
I jump in because my feelings are hurt,

311
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,413
'cause I don't know,

312
00:12:16,413 --> 00:12:20,690
I want these two guys to like
me, not think I'm a douchebag.

313
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,470
I reply with my true
feeling, which is like,

314
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,330
"Yo, guys, can you stop creating ammo

315
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,880
"for my friends to make fun of me with?"

316
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,500
And, "I wish you good health,

317
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,810
"I hope we get to share a glass of wine,"

318
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,090
'cause I notice one guy's from Australia,

319
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,060
I like Australian wines.

320
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,640
I was answering one of the guys,

321
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,473
and then I got to the office

322
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:37,900
and I didn't see if the
other guy was engaged.

323
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,530
One guy jumped in and said,

324
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,330
"Touche," or "Fair enough,

325
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,350
"if you're ever in Australia,
let's grab that glass,"

326
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,990
and I loved it, because, like,

327
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,960
it's less that my feelings are hurt,

328
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,210
it's that I respect
everybody else's opinions

329
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,610
no matter who they are,

330
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,060
even within my own success.

331
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,760
I think I'm gonna be all-time,

332
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,190
yet I don't believe that your
or your 17-year-old son's,

333
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,880
or those two guys's opinions

334
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,880
are any less valuable than mine.

335
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,480
I just think my ultimate
superpower is empathy,

336
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,820
at the highest level.

337
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,110
I think I'm so empathetic

338
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,390
that everything else I
am is almost secondary,

339
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,140
even though I have a lot of
other strong characteristics,

340
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,620
strengths and weaknesses.

341
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,720
Of course, my feelings are hurt,

342
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,330
'cause I'm so empathetic,

343
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,930
yet I'm so self-aware and confident

344
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,380
that it's not able to fully
penetrate and become a negative.

345
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,640
I think it becomes a positive,

346
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,440
because I know how to calibrate

347
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,460
the pushback or the name-calling.

348
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,754
- [Jen] Obviously--

349
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:41,587
- That was a good articulation.

350
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,510
- [Jen] Some empathy and
you were born with that,

351
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,360
and then the other part
is you had great parents.

352
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,560
- And great circumstance, right?

353
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,750
I lost a lot as a kid.

354
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,460
I didn't speak the language.

355
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,710
We had no money.

356
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,070
I wasn't a great athlete.

357
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,460
I was a terrible student.

358
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,484
I've lived my first 18 years
of my life as a fucking loser,

359
00:13:58,484 --> 00:14:01,790
which made the next fucking
100 years super easy

360
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,390
because I wasn't scared of losing.

361
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:07,180
A lot of kids are coddled,
overloved, eighth-place trophies.

362
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,140
And no one loved, actually
believed, that's not true.

363
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,060
Let me start again.

364
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,390
A lot of people were coddled.

365
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,210
A lot of people are eighth-place trophies.

366
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,070
A lot of people didn't deal with adversity

367
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,800
because they figured out
how to run the school model

368
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,600
and were straight-A students,

369
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,530
gifted with talent in sports.

370
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,040
And so they were winning
their first 18 years,

371
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,210
so when they go into real
life with inevitable losses,

372
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,021
especially for somebody
who pandered to the system,

373
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:32,350
which means they then
go work in a corporation

374
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,480
where they have no control
and merit doesn't ride,

375
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,600
I'm the reverse.

376
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,280
- [Jen] You said you were
a loser the first 18 years,

377
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,380
but I have the sense
that you were probably

378
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,680
a popular kid in school.

379
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,513
Very.
- Were you?

380
00:14:45,513 --> 00:14:46,600
- [Gary] Yes, I was super,

381
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,210
and that part has never gone away.

382
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,620
I was popular for, you
know, I have charisma,

383
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,970
so that's always good.

384
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,500
I was popular because I was super nice.

385
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,600
Nice has been,

386
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,510
you know, over the last week or two,

387
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,360
I have started pushing kindness and nice.

388
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,920
It's funny.

389
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,740
I feel like, almost just like
I figured out my back was hurt

390
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,310
after figuring my adductor
was hurt, and my knee,

391
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,000
and my neck, and my shoulder,

392
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,310
I feel like I'm just going through my life

393
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,500
and discovering, wait a
minute, it's not just hustle!

394
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,630
Wait a minute, it's not just sales!

395
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,500
Wait a minute, it's not just empathy!

396
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,630
I feel like somewhere literally
within the last 10 days,

397
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,850
I'm like, "Huh,

398
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,930
"kindness is probably a real big reason

399
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,030
"this is all working out for me."

400
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,600
And so, in school, my kindness was amazing

401
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,300
'cause I was so self-confident

402
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,080
that I wasn't willing to make fun of kids

403
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,160
when that's what the cool kids did.

404
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,870
That, in a weird way, over time,

405
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,830
made me quite popular
with a lot of people.

406
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,663
- [Jen] Oh, my God,

407
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,020
I just thought of the
name of your new book.

408
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,395
It's Crush It With Kindness.

409
00:15:50,395 --> 00:15:52,620
Instead of Kill 'Em With Kindness,

410
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,510
Crush it With Kindness, that's it.

411
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,780
Just send me, like 1%, that's all I need.

412
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,670
- I think kindness

413
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,410
is something that I will
continue to tap into this year.

414
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,160
This will be the Year of
Kindness in my content.

415
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,050
I can feel it.

416
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,430
I'm excited about that because

417
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,560
self-awareness and gratitude
and work ethic and honor,

418
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,490
I think, is something that an alpha male

419
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,590
can kind of like get there to.

420
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:20,550
Kindness, being sweet, being a sweetheart,

421
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,750
is just not necessarily

422
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:29,000
the thing that I think people
naturally gravitate towards,

423
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,833
and it's funny.

424
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,300
My public persona,

425
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,280
AKA, when I do interviews and speeches,

426
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,040
I wouldn't say is filled with kindness.

427
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,490
I'm my most combative and competitive.

428
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,730
It's that my real life

429
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,230
is so filled with kindness and sweetness,

430
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,350
and I think it's going
to be interesting to see

431
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,760
how I tap into this and
how I articulate it.

432
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,593
- [Jen] Oh, wow.

433
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:50,250
I just can't wait to see where this goes.

434
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,480
I think that's amazing.

435
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,313
And it's funny,

436
00:16:52,313 --> 00:16:54,310
because the other challenger,

437
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,010
James Altucher, when he came on the show,

438
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,040
I asked him,

439
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,940
"Have you had situations where

440
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,319
"you've interviewed
people who are winners,

441
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,289
"or they're these big guys
who are really, like, jerks?"

442
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,190
And he said, "You know, not really.

443
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,140
"One or two," he said,

444
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,420
"But the truth is, people
don't get that far, usually,

445
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,869
"by being super-jerks."

446
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,549
- And definitely not people

447
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,660
who are playing

448
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,369
in a game that is based on merit,

449
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:26,499
like entrepreneurship, right?

450
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,870
It's a little bit easier to
navigate through corporate,

451
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,670
which is a lot of what we're
seeing now in the world,

452
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,050
because you can be protected,

453
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,050
'cause the market isn't fair.

454
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,980
It's hedged by the tastemakers
and the gatekeepers.

455
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,060
The more entrepreneurial,

456
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,530
the more fair it is, to James's point,

457
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,680
the more likely you have
to be a decent person.

458
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,430
And definitely if you wanna
build something really big,

459
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,010
for the long haul.

460
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,700
I'm trying to build an
absolute business empire

461
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,490
and be admired.

462
00:17:59,758 --> 00:18:01,630
That is a very

463
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,960
zero-sum game.

464
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,630
Either you are kind and
talented, or you're not.

465
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,070
- [Jen] Who would it mean the most to you,

466
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,680
besides your parents and
your kids and everybody,

467
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,440
who would it mean the most
for you to be admired by?

468
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,060
I mean, like, anyone specifically

469
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,120
that you've got filed away
that you're like, yeah?

470
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,300
- Probably Brandon Warnke,
he runs Wine Library.

471
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,710
He's my best friend.

472
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,700
To me, it's very simple.

473
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,590
I wanna be admired by the
people that know me the best,

474
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,440
because they actually know the truth.

475
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,820
It's super more important
to me that Tyler and Tyler,

476
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,010
who are sitting across from me right now,

477
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,760
my ad man and one of the
guy's who's on my contact team

478
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,060
who films me often.

479
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,290
It's much more important to me

480
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,320
that they blindly think I'm the best

481
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,070
than an employee at Vayner
that's not interacting with me

482
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,880
more than once or twice a year,

483
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,130
because they know.

484
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,571
- [Jen] I was watching you
walk through your office,

485
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:54,380
and all those, I guess
hundreds of employees,

486
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,920
and I thought, because you are your brand

487
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,600
and because you are such a strong brand

488
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,560
and because people gravitate to you,

489
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,400
I'm sure that's one of
the big selling points,

490
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,940
that they wanna come and work for you.

491
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,530
But not everybody can
get that access to you,

492
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,810
so I bet that's a huge challenge for you

493
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,060
to figure out how you're
gonna divvy up Gary.

494
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,920
All those people-

495
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,130
- Yes and no.

496
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,450
I think that a lot of them actually

497
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,940
wanna just work at a great agency, and

498
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,552
haven't gotten into,

499
00:19:25,552 --> 00:19:28,540
there's some people that are
even weirdly, not oblivious,

500
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,100
but really don't know the extent

501
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,140
of what's happening out there
with my life in that realm,

502
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,070
and that's great, because
I'll be honest with you.

503
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,480
I associate much more

504
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,730
to Gary Vaynerchuk, the CEO
of VaynerX, VaynerMedia,

505
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,410
than I do as GaryVee.

506
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,310
I associate more to being Gary Vaynerchuk,

507
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:47,440
the guy behind the strategy
of GaryVee, than GaryVee.

508
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,920
And look, GaryVee is me.

509
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,600
It's my energy when I'm
trying to talk to the world.

510
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,740
But most of my life is spent
not talking to the world.

511
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,200
I do the best I can.

512
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,000
I mean, I think that's
just important as a CEO,

513
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,610
let alone as a personality.

514
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:09,260
I think the people that are
most bought into me, fans,

515
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,140
get their way into spending time with me

516
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,460
because they can't hold out, right?

517
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,870
They ask for the meeting, they
hover around, they hang out.

518
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,770
Or some just kind of wait
and wait for their moment,

519
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,700
but again, it's not
something I kill myself with.

520
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,240
- [Jen] I'm a marketer in
a sea of digital marketers.

521
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,040
I think I'm special,

522
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,750
I think that I'm a favorite

523
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,560
because of the level of
service and care and love

524
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,580
that I give to the people
who are in my orbit.

525
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,413
But

526
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:38,980
I'm not niched down.

527
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,390
I do know the value of it.

528
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,470
I wish so badly that I could find a niche.

529
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,680
Do you think that it's--

530
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,604
- No.

531
00:20:45,604 --> 00:20:47,578
You're, you're, you're, you're--

532
00:20:47,578 --> 00:20:49,100
- [Jen] I don't wanna
do just, like, lawyers.

533
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,460
- Your niche is you.

534
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,470
I'm not niche, my niche is that it's me,

535
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,020
and my perspective and my efforts and me.

536
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,720
There's nothing more niche
than being the human being.

537
00:20:59,570 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Jen] Okay, that's awesome.
