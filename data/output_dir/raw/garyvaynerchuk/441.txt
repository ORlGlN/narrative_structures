1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,837
- Good morning, 
thrilled to be here.

2
00:00:02,837 --> 00:00:07,274
Sorry I'm a little delayed,
mother nature never loses.

3
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:09,543
What I really want to
do is actually pontificate

4
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:12,279
a little bit,
they've given me a time slot

5
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:16,049
and I decided as I was
looking at the social mentions

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,986
and just kind of the
context of this event,

7
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:20,821
that a lot of people
actually did have context

8
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:23,390
for my spiel, some have
shared the stage with me,

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,227
others have been engaging and
so I decided to actually cut

10
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,829
my chatting down a little bit

11
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:31,231
because the truth is
as a lot of you know,

12
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,834
I'll put out my general
thoughts on entrepreneurship

13
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:36,803
and business on
pretty much a daily basis,

14
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,238
I thought what would
be much more interesting

15
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,441
is actually try to do
as much Q&amp;A as possible.

16
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,845
So, because what I think
is then I can answer

17
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,947
your questions and
I find that even when I answer

18
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:50,951
them very specifically that
takes care of 20 or 30 percent

19
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:52,619
of the audience's
questions, so I'll get into that

20
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,321
in a little bit,
but first I'll give you

21
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,790
a little bit of the chat.

22
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,558
You know, I've been
thinking a lot lately

23
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,330
about this whole journey
about how entrepreneurship

24
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,900
has become something of a status

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,136
and has been put on a pedestal.

26
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:12,272
I've also been
thinking about how scary it is

27
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:15,342
when something
becomes cool or interesting

28
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,744
and what that creates
and I've been pondering

29
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,047
that quite a bit
which is the differences

30
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:23,016
between being an entrepreneur

31
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,786
and being a
successful entrepreneur.

32
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:29,623
You know, putting the
fact that you're a CEO

33
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:32,693
in your Instagram
profile doesn't mean that

34
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:33,760
it's what you're
gonna be able to do

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,762
for the rest of your life
and what I'm really concerned

36
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:40,767
about is that we have lived
both in Canada and the US,

37
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,470
with basically a
eight to nine year macro,

38
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,640
almost a decade of
good economic growth.

39
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,474
We just have.

40
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,377
You know obviously there was a
crash in the US in 2008, '09.

41
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:54,147
But if you look at the data,
we're probably on the tail end

42
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,883
of economic growth,
obviously nobody knows,

43
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,119
otherwise they would
make trillions of dollars

44
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,454
but one of the things
that I did want to talk

45
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,123
to guys about
today is practicality.

46
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:07,594
I think practicality stunningly
not talked about enough

47
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,229
so for example, if you're
running a business right now

48
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,966
and it's predicated
on raising money

49
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,702
or you've raised money
and you lose money each month,

50
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,071
it's probably a really
good idea to change course

51
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,272
pretty quickly.

52
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,641
Because the biggest
issue for me right now,

53
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,378
is that we have a lot of people
who want to build brands,

54
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:25,846
who want to become influencers,

55
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:29,216
who want to start companies
but they're not putting

56
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,984
in the pieces that
actually allow them

57
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,387
to weather the storm.

58
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:34,621
You know the thing
that I'm most proud of

59
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,790
is the two biggest
businesses I've ever built,

60
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,293
I basically started them
during very difficult times.

61
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,696
When I first got involved in
my dad's liquor store business,

62
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:45,599
it was the late '90s and
just about a year and a half

63
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,602
into my journey, I guess
two years into my journey,

64
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,771
the stock market crashed and
all the internet companies

65
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,040
folded and all the
people that were making money

66
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,941
that I was
targeting to sell wine,

67
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,244
stopped having
money to buy wine.

68
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:00,380
And then right behind that,
because most of my business

69
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,982
was New York and New
Jersey based, even though

70
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,517
we were building
an internet company,

71
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,386
it was only about a
year later that 9/11 happened

72
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,790
and not only,
changed, I mean for anybody

73
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,358
that lived in New York,
New Jersey area,

74
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,226
it was much more
compounded for us

75
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:16,163
because we lost
loved ones and I remember

76
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:19,566
I lost 100 employees from
one organization in one day.

77
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,368
I had to go in hand by
hand and take their emails out

78
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,870
because everybody passed
away from Canter Fitzgerald

79
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,038
that worked in that office.

80
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:29,976
So I persevered through
that because I was practical.

81
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,645
Because I didn't
have a lot of overhead

82
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,880
and because I wasn't
romantic, I wasn't dreaming,

83
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,982
I knew that I had
to buy and sell wine

84
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,551
and liquor and beer
and I had to make sure

85
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,420
that my expenses
weren't greater than the money

86
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,755
I was bringing in.

87
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:46,827
VaynerMedia started in the
ashes of the economic meltdown

88
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:49,429
of the U.S., when I started
VaynerMedia, people didn't want

89
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:53,100
to pay $5,000,
let alone the $50 or $100,000

90
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,269
they pay us a month
now for our services.

91
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,539
And when I started VaynerMedia,
you know it's funny,

92
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,908
I watch everybody
watch my journey now

93
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:05,779
and there's that clichÃ© thing
of overnight success, right?

94
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,782
I'm going to have this
TV show come out this June.

95
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,117
And it's going to
change my profile right?

96
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,852
I'm going to sit on
a stage with Will.i.am

97
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,353
and Gwyneth Paltrow
and Jessica Alba

98
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,522
for this Apple show
that I'm about to do

99
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:16,990
and everybody's going to
say where'd he come from,

100
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,226
that happened
overnight, you know.

101
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,695
And it's even
really happened in social,

102
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:24,297
I'm sure for a lot of you,
you've only really even

103
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,366
have known about me for
the last six months or so,

104
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,702
even though I've been
putting out content online

105
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:31,037
for 10 years every single day.

106
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,106
And so the thing
that I've been really

107
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,841
thinking about is practicality.

108
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,577
Like VaynerMedia even
though I had already built

109
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,080
a nice size business,
it wasn't like I was extracting

110
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,082
a lot of money
out of Wine Library

111
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:45,418
and so when AJ and I started
VaynerMedia, seven years ago,

112
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,287
we started it out
of a company called

113
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,389
BuddyMedia's conference room.

114
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,058
For the first two years
that I ran VaynerMedia,

115
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,860
we had no rent.

116
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,529
We first worked
out of a conference room,

117
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,364
a conference room.

118
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,766
We then worked out of a
co-working space before

119
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:03,069
the whole WeWork and
co-working space revolution,

120
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:07,207
and I bartered my
time to help that company

121
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,676
in exchange for
a very small space.

122
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,278
We didn't buy furniture.

123
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,546
We scrapped.

124
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:13,513
And I'd already made it.

125
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,115
I was already rich.

126
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,683
And we scrapped.

127
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,985
And so the biggest thing that
I wanna implore everybody

128
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,955
here today to do
is to take a step back

129
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,624
and think about
how fancy are they?

130
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,860
Are you willing to be
really, really, really ghetto?

131
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,128
Do you really need that chair?

132
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,597
Do you really need
that piece of technology?

133
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:33,166
Do you really
need to fly that class?

134
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,035
Like, I just think
that we're living through

135
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:39,039
an incredibly fancy
culture of entrepreneurship.

136
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,409
Entrepreneurship and
CEO status is quite sexy.

137
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,212
People are selling a
lifestyle that is filled with

138
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:48,982
lots of fun and trips
and champagne and bikinis

139
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:52,452
and bling-bling and all
sorts of horse shit, right?

140
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,454
(audience laughter)

141
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:58,792
And I just think that
that era of this era is gonna

142
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,194
come to an end somewhere
within the next five years,

143
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,496
and very honestly, I just
don't want a lot of people

144
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,032
in this room that dream
to build their own businesses

145
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:10,670
to have to go work at a bank,
or go work at a retail store,

146
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,773
and so I would highly recommend
something that I think

147
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,676
is stunningly not
talked about enough, which is,

148
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:20,180
if you're building a business,
you have to be making money.

149
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,385
(audience applause)

150
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:31,758
And so, I know that's
like a funny thing to say,

151
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,060
but I think it's important.

152
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,161
I think the other
thing that's important

153
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,031
is to shift the context
completely the other way,

154
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,433
which is what is
really winning, right?

155
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,535
Like, what is the
definition of winning,

156
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,071
and I think we all have
different definitions, right?

157
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,440
And I think that one
of the things that I also

158
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,542
wanna say is that I'm getting
scared that a lot of people

159
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,245
that are following my
journey hear me talking about

160
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,649
buying the New York Jets,
and I do aspire to buy

161
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,218
a three-billion dollar
sports franchise, I do,

162
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,288
it is what I want, you can
look at my fifth grade yearbook

163
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:04,324
long before business was
cool, it's what I wanna do.

164
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,559
But I'm awfully
scared that it's pressuring

165
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,729
the people that follow me
into trying to achieve things

166
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,998
that they don't necessarily
want, they just think it's

167
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,800
the thing you do
if you're trying to be

168
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,135
a successful businessperson.

169
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,469
Let me promise you something.

170
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,672
I know tens of
thousands of people,

171
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,507
and I know thousands
of people extremely well,

172
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,976
and I know hundreds
of people deeply well.

173
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:26,146
There is no correlation
between how much money

174
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,648
someone makes and
their level of happiness.

175
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:32,118
I have friends who
make $47,000 a year,

176
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,987
and they're the
happiest people I know.

177
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,655
Their work/life
balance is on point,

178
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,490
they're part of
two soccer teams,

179
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,658
they play video games,

180
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,360
they watch every show they want,

181
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,595
they take two vacations
that they scrap together,

182
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,698
and they're
freaking happy as well.

183
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,666
And I know tons of
people who I grew up with

184
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,402
in the Silicon Valley
boom who have hundreds

185
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,738
of millions of
dollars in their bank account

186
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,673
and are as
miserable and as lonely

187
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,475
and as broken
as you'll ever see,

188
00:07:55,475 --> 00:08:00,347
so I implore all of you
to please reverse engineer

189
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,881
and figure out who you are,

190
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:06,820
and figure out what level of
monetizing and stuff you need,

191
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,822
and what level of
creativity you need.

192
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:09,723
I promise you one thing,

193
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:12,926
one thing that will
catch you very off-guard.

194
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,395
I should be way more rich.

195
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:18,098
I leave money on
the table every day.

196
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:21,101
I've left ungodly amounts
of money on the table.

197
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:24,771
I spend tons of time sending DMs

198
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,140
and engaging with people
and meeting people randomly

199
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,308
and not cashing in.

200
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:31,344
I actually believe the
statement I'm about to make.

201
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,481
I think that I love
the journey and the game

202
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,515
of entrepreneurship so much

203
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:41,154
that I have subconsciously
sabotaged my financial upside

204
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,056
to make sure I can
play this a little longer,

205
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,191
'cause I fear if the
numbers keep getting too big,

206
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,828
eventually, it will
take the fun out of it.

207
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,097
When you are
lucky enough like I am

208
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:54,401
to actually do something
that you love so much,

209
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:58,238
do something that puts
pressure against the one thing

210
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,506
you care about besides it,

211
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,641
which is the time
I spend with my family.

212
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,976
My family's my whole life,

213
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,945
and being this and doing this

214
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,148
is the only thing
that cuts into that.

215
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:11,584
I couldn't breathe if
I wasn't an entrepreneur.

216
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:14,487
I didn't breathe when
I wasn't an entrepreneur.

217
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,023
That's the reason I got
D's and F's in school.

218
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,125
'Cause I just couldn't be me,

219
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,960
and I'm not capable of that.

220
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,464
And so, I think
being here excites me

221
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:28,101
because I think coming
to not L.A., San Francisco,

222
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,370
New York, London, is
always more fun for me.

223
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,305
It always feels a
little more practical.

224
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,773
It always feels like
there's a little bit more

225
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,843
chips on the shoulder,
which is what I have.

226
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,645
But I wanna remind everybody,

227
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,547
just 'cause you didn't
grow up with a trust fund,

228
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:43,383
just 'cause you don't
live in Silicon Valley,

229
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,118
the market doesn't care.

230
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,654
If you're good
enough, you will win,

231
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,089
and I hope that you don't ...

232
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,992
(audience applause)
It's true.

233
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,363
And if you sit
around and ponder,

234
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,165
well, if I didn't live here,

235
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,367
or if my mom
wasn't an alcoholic,

236
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,237
or if I just
learned about this earlier,

237
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,339
or if I'd been
following this person earlier,

238
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,475
or if I wasn't born a woman,

239
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,076
or if I wasn't born a minority,

240
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:14,247
if you sit and do that,
you are losing.

241
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:17,383
You're not wrong,
it's just that business

242
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:20,620
and marketing and
all this doesn't care.

243
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,389
There's just no
emotion in the market.

244
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,558
Like that's it.

245
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,828
And so I think we need
to start having much deeper,

246
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,999
much more serious conversations
of practicality, you know?

247
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:36,703
It's fun and I love
this space the most

248
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:39,105
but I loved it
long before it was sexy.

249
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,773
I loved it long
before people wanted

250
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,108
to take selfies with me.

251
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,878
I loved it long before
athletes and celebrities

252
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:47,213
and rappers wanted
to be entrepreneurs.

253
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,782
I loved it long before that.
It was my destiny.

254
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,485
It was who I was,
it was how I was wired,

255
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,554
it was the only
thing I knew, that's why

256
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:57,891
the four-year-old me
ripped flowers out of yards

257
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,827
and sold it.

258
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,129
You don't read about
being entrepreneur at

259
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,164
five, six,
seven, eight and nine.

260
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,200
I didn't jump on
this because it's cool now

261
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,335
and it makes me money and girls.

262
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,305
I did it 'cause
it's all I ever was.

263
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:15,742
And I implore you, if you came
here to be an entrepreneur

264
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,243
but this talk
allows you to realize

265
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,046
you're really an artist or
you're really a number three

266
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,882
in a company because you
bring this level of energy

267
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,284
and don't want
to be a number one

268
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:25,685
because let me promise
you something about being

269
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,421
a number one, I'm
not an entrepreneur,

270
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,757
I'm a fire fighter.

271
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:34,761
My entire life is
taking care of crap.

272
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:39,499
Putting out fires,
24/7/365, my whole life

273
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,100
is this is a problem.

274
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,303
Fix this and guess what?

275
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,138
When you're the
last line of defense,

276
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,807
there's no blaming your boss.

277
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,742
There's no blaming the logo.

278
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,911
There's no
blaming the government.

279
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,746
It's all my fault.

280
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:54,981
All of it.

281
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:59,919
And so, it's super sexy but
what's not being talked about

282
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,288
is the friends and
acquaintances I have

283
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,724
who've committed
suicide in the entrepreneur land

284
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,225
in the last four years.

285
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,962
Because nobody
talks about the downside.

286
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,230
Everybody thinks
they're going to be Zucks.

287
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,866
Everybody thinks
they're going to build Snapchat.

288
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,336
Go look at the data.

289
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,738
The data shows that the
far majority of this room

290
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,740
will not succeed,
not even close,

291
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,308
to building an actual business.

292
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,011
And I don't come
here to be somber.

293
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:27,013
I come here to
remind you that there's only

294
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,816
one thing you can do.

295
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:33,553
The only thing you
can do that can trump

296
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:37,290
the moment mommy and
daddy had sex to make you,

297
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,125
the only thing
that can trump that,

298
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,027
the only thing
that can trump your DNA,

299
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,196
the only thing
that is controllable,

300
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:46,132
if you want it,
if you want this,

301
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:49,369
is work.

302
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:53,239
(audience applause)

303
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,008
It is.

304
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,277
It's the only tangible,
and by the way,

305
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,444
I don't know if
you've guys noticed,

306
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,113
I've stopped even,
and it's funny given

307
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,448
the name of the conference,
I've started using

308
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,818
the word work more
than the word hustle

309
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,353
just because I want
everybody to understand

310
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,656
what we're really
talking about here.

311
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:12,592
If you've got a big mouth
and a lot of you do here,

312
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:16,896
searched the hashtag and a lot
of you say CEO/Founder/Owner.

313
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,898
I call that big mouth.

314
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,567
If you've got
the audacity to do it

315
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,370
and so many of you
have heard this from me,

316
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,041
when I audit you and I do,
because I'm curious,

317
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,643
it's how I learn,
people talk a big game.

318
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,979
I especially love when
somebody hits me up on social,

319
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,248
like Gary Vee,
you're gonna buy the Jets,

320
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,850
I'm gonna buy
the Rams, you know?

321
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,218
(audience laughter)

322
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,120
Everybody's
buying a sports team.

323
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,957
And I love to look
at what that person does

324
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,393
and then I'll DM
that person and be like,

325
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:51,397
"Yo bro, nobody, nobody, unless
they were a trust fund baby,

326
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,133
"ever bought the
Rams when they go skiing

327
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,369
"for a week when they're 24."

328
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:02,775
Nobody you know, nobody you
know,

329
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,711
nobody you know,

330
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:08,748
has become successful, outside
of it being given to them

331
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:12,852
from their family, nobody
you know has actually created

332
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:17,223
success without
working their face off.

333
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,258
It doesn't exist.

334
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:22,028
So you can sit
and talk about luck

335
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:26,032
and you can sit and talk about
this that or the other thing

336
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,202
but I promise you, the only
controllable thing you have

337
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,470
is your work ethic.

338
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,774
So going back to the
beginning of my talk,

339
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:39,212
you need to ploy serious,
serious self-awareness

340
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,047
and figure out who you are.

341
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:45,451
I implore you to start
matching your work ethic

342
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,621
and your actions to your mouth.

343
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,289
If you're gonna
be a billionaire,

344
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,925
you need to
realize that most people

345
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:56,095
that create billion
dollars worth of wealth,

346
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:59,866
don't do anything
besides work, every single day

347
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:02,068
of their 20's and 30's.

348
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,137
All of them.

349
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,739
Every person that
works at VaynerMedia

350
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,510
has taken more
vacations in the last 13 months

351
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,814
than I did in my
entire 20's and early 30's.

352
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:18,918
My family went on two family
vacations my entire childhood.

353
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,787
I was married to
my wife for five years

354
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:24,223
before we had a family,
we took two vacations.

355
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,261
It's the price you
have to pay if you want it

356
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,296
at the level that I want it at.

357
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:34,200
And by the way, I advise nobody
to want it at that level.

358
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,434
(audience laughter)

359
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,637
I'm being dead serious,
this is a very true statement

360
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,105
that I think most of
you will not believe,

361
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,808
but I'm telling you
it's the goddamn truth.

362
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:46,212
If there was a drug that
could take some ambition out,

363
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,547
I would take it.

364
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,717
It is so extreme, it is all in.

365
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:54,954
The reason I started
DailyVee was to remind you

366
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,989
that I'm outworking you,

367
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,292
that when you talk and
you're trying to figure it out,

368
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,460
when you're trying to
say you're gonna be like me,

369
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,429
I want you to see it, I want you

370
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,998
to see every other day, 5 A.M.,

371
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,668
I want you to see
every day midnight,

372
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:13,005
all of them, every day,
always, forever.

373
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,607
(audience laughter)

374
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,176
That's what it
takes for what I want.

375
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:21,647
Good news is, between what
I want and what is achievable

376
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,750
and is considered
unbelievably all-time happy

377
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,686
is a big gap.

378
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,387
So there's
plenty of vacation time.

379
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,456
I know tons of
people with vacation time,

380
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,625
I know tons of people
with work-life balance,

381
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,194
I know tons of people
that do tons of fun activities

382
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:38,598
and make seven figure,
millions of dollars a year

383
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,432
and love it.

384
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:43,703
I'm playing for legacy,
I'm playing for all-time,

385
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,538
I'm looking to
impact every generation

386
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:47,540
that comes behind me
because I wanna show

387
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,209
that you can
build all-time wealth,

388
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:54,780
all-time greatness doing it
the right way and the old way.

389
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,182
That's what I'm up to.

390
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,751
So please make sure
you understand that,

391
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,621
and, more importantly, make
sure you understand yourself

392
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,089
so that you can
reverse engineer that blueprint

393
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,092
and figure out
where you fit within that

394
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:09,060
and then deploy it,
but I promise you,

395
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,431
but I promise you,
you will not get there

396
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,902
with your big idea.
I promise you, sitting around

397
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:19,105
and saying, "Oh, (snaps fingers)
I had that idea for Uber

398
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,941
"before Uber did."
(audience laughter)

399
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:23,409
Nobody gives a shit.

400
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,344
(audience laughter)

401
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,280
I've got every idea
that's gonna be successful

402
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,248
over the next hundred
years, it's all about AI

403
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,684
and VR and AR and
augmented and all this,

404
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,153
I'll give 'em to you all. It
doesn't matter,

405
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,856
'cause most of you
won't execute against it.

406
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,591
The reason I put
out all my best stuff

407
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,593
and I'm liked and
I don't charge for it

408
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:43,796
is somewhere along the line
I realized that 99.9% of you

409
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,865
aren't gonna do
anything about it.

410
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:46,999
(audience laughter)

411
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,969
You're gonna ponder it, you're
gonna get super pumped up

412
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,238
when you watch me say it

413
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,674
and then three weeks
later you're gonna give up,

414
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,209
'cause you're not
willing to pay the price.

415
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,146
And that's cool,
everybody's different.

416
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,480
But you need to
figure out what price

417
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,382
you are willing to
pay for what you want.

418
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,418
It has been insane
to me how many people

419
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,520
have emailed me
in the last month

420
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,789
about the 2017 Flip Challenge,

421
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,490
which for you that don't know,

422
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,959
was a video I made in December,

423
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:16,829
which is, so many of you
email me asking me for $5,000

424
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,098
and meanwhile
there's $5,000 worth of crap

425
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,566
sitting in your house right now,

426
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,502
go grab it,
post it on eBay, flip it,

427
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,403
and make your money.

428
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,471
How many people
have flipped something

429
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,305
since they saw that video?

430
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,673
Raise your hands,
just wanna see.

431
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,109
Higher, higher, don't be shy!

432
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,714
That's it, you know, like,
it's insane people emailing me

433
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,749
like, "Hey this,
like, I just made $8,000

434
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,884
"'cause I sold $100 of
this, then this happened,

435
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,052
"and this happened,
and this happened."

436
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,455
Funny thing happens
when you actually work.

437
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,523
(audience laughter)

438
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:45,524
Go figure.

439
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,827
Funny thing happens when you
actually realize it's money

440
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,029
that gives you the opportunity.

441
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,031
Everybody's got a big idea,

442
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,867
everybody's got
the Uber of lawnmowers,

443
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:59,105
everybody's got the Airbnb of
ice cream. (audience laughter)

444
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:01,674
It's not gonna happen.

445
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:04,510
And if it does, please,
take the clip of this talk,

446
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:08,514
email me and say in the title,
"Garyvee, you were wrong."

447
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,648
And I will be
the first to call you

448
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,984
and say, 
"Mazel Tov, I am so pumped."

449
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,719
(audience laughter)

450
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,221
But I just wanna remind every,

451
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:18,457
especially 20 and
30-year-old in this room,

452
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:21,560
I came out the gate
and I worked every day

453
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:26,165
for 13 years before I said
a goddamn word to anybody.

454
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,801
I talk a whole lot
now, and I've made up

455
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,736
for those 13 years
of silence (chuckles).

456
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,138
(audience laughtr)

457
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,139
but I just
wanna remind everybody

458
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,740
that I didn't make
a video to the world

459
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,642
about anything about business

460
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,311
until I was 35 years old,

461
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,213
after I worked every single day

462
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:44,683
from the time I was
22 and, in reality, 14,

463
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,652
and then I started talking.

464
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,921
There's a whole lot
of talking going on,

465
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,656
how about more action?

466
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,958
How about more execution?

467
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,862
How about more paying prices
for what your mouth is saying?

468
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,732
That is what I hope you do.

469
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:00,800
Thank you.

470
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,004
(audience applause)

471
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,480
- That felt good.
- [Woman] Hello, hello!

472
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,249
Gary thank you so much for
coming here, we know it was

473
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:20,186
a very tough road for
you to get here today.

474
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:20,986
This guy's a trooper.

475
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,422
If you guys only knew.

476
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,491
Could we get another round of
applause over here for Gary?

477
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:29,028
(audience applause)
For making this a priority!

478
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,697
This guy went through hell
and high water to get here,

479
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:32,531
and we are so thankful.

480
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,634
So we're gonna do a couple
of questions, as we told you.

481
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,002
We have a bunch of
questions from Twitter,

482
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,637
so we'll start there, and
then we're definitely gonna

483
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,140
come around to
some audience questions.

484
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,341
Okay Gary. 
- Yes.

485
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,776
- First question via Twitter.

486
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:44,443
- Yes.

487
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,312
- How important
is it to take risks

488
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:48,547
when you're starting a business?

489
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,650
- I mean, I think it
comes down to your talent.

490
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,385
So one of the things
that I'm fascinated by

491
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,222
is how many people
are scared to take risks,

492
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,023
and then take credit for things.

493
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,458
For example, let me explain.

494
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,026
The amount of
businesses that I've looked at

495
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,662
over the last decade, that
are doing $1 million,

496
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:04,997
$2 million,
$4 million,

497
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,867
$8 million in sales
and are successful,

498
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:11,570
and the founder is kind
of making fun of other people

499
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,672
for different things,
and then I remind them,

500
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,975
that if I had run their
business, instead of doing

501
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,677
two million, it
would be doing 19.

502
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,813
They take a step back, and
then I try to explain to them

503
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:23,949
in detail, and
here's where I'm getting at.

504
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,252
Everybody's got their own
cadence and their own talent.

505
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:28,854
But taking risks is how
you make real things happen.

506
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,723
It's how you take quantum leaps.

507
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:33,792
The amount of things
I failed at, at VaynerMedia,

508
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,428
from an agenda standpoint,
over the last seven years,

509
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:39,865
is enormous, because I take
micro-risks all the time.

510
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,001
Risks that, if they
go to zero, which is how

511
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,937
I think about them, will
not put me out of business.

512
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:48,007
But risk, for example,
took a lot of risks last year.

513
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:50,576
Last year we did
$100 million in revenue.

514
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:53,012
The year before, we did 67.

515
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:56,549
We mad the same amount
of money in both years.

516
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:57,783
Risks.

517
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:01,253
Lost 33 million dollars
of profit against that gross,

518
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,322
you know, probably left
six, seven million dollars

519
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,659
in profit on the table,
because I took risks.

520
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,327
The good news is, one
of those risks is probably

521
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,697
gonna make me 50 more
in revenue in three years.

522
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,999
So I think risks are
imperative, and I want to remind

523
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,936
the people here, who
are conservative, you know,

524
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,237
that's great, and
if you're at the number

525
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:19,805
that you want to be at, great.

526
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,341
The one thing I would say is,
the biggest fear I have

527
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,377
for people that don't take
risks, is that your competitors

528
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:28,080
might, and then
you're in trouble.

529
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,217
So a lot of people think
it's insular, but it's not.

530
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:33,586
Maybe the person that
owned the most cab medallions

531
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:36,622
in New York should have taken
a risk and built a cab app.

532
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,259
- True, very true.

533
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,995
- Maybe, maybe
The Hilton, right.

534
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:45,397
Maybe The Westin, maybe
Four Seasons should have

535
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,933
taken a risk and
created a platform where we rent

536
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:50,836
each other our
own rooms, you know?

537
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,038
So risks are important.

538
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,541
- On that note though,
just to follow-up.

539
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,575
Do you think
that larger companies

540
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:57,543
are more adverse to risk?

541
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,411
- A hundred percent.

542
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,047
And I think small
companies are scared of risk.

543
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,350
I think people are scared.

544
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,753
I think people lack self esteem.

545
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,255
- You're helping that
situation, let me tell ya.

546
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:09,822
- I'm trying.

547
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,925
- Okay, so that question,
just to give a shout-out,

548
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:17,162
that question was from
wojackter, DJ Wojackter.

549
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:17,997
- Alright.

550
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:19,698
- And our next Twitter question.

551
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,200
Am I saying that right?

552
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,701
- No no, he might not be here.

553
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,303
Twitter's open to everyone.

554
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:26,772
(audience laughs)

555
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:30,242
- You are right, you are right.

556
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,577
We did put out the
hashtag this morning.

557
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:35,481
No it's our own, it's
our HHAskGaryVee hashtag so,

558
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,049
hopefully he is here, or she,

559
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,051
or whatever heard that question.

560
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:42,521
Our next one from Blair Kennedy.

561
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,658
Will you ever open a
VaynerMedia office in Canada?

562
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:46,659
- Yes.

563
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:49,395
- Really?
(audience applause)

564
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:51,797
Okay, so let us know
when that's happening,

565
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:52,932
and we'll help you guys apply.

566
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,900
- I promise you'll know.

567
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,101
- Awesome, awesome.

568
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,972
Okay let's go to an audience
question, oh my goodness.

569
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:01,540
How am I gonna decide?

570
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,808
- Who's got the mic?
You got the mic?

571
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,877
- Okay good, you're not
leaving it up to me.

572
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,011
- Pick anyone.

573
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,346
I'm gonna hang as long as I can.

574
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:08,981
I'll answer as many as I can.

575
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,282
Just give me your name.

576
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,216
- [Pedro] Pedro, hi.

577
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,418
- Pedro, what's up brother?

578
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:14,586
- I'm fucking so
nervous right now, okay.

579
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,288
(audience laughter)

580
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,823
- Can you stand up?

581
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,758
- Gary, you changed my life.

582
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,593
- I promise most people
didn't think that I'd be

583
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,696
the second person to
drop an F-bomb today.

584
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:24,897
(audience laughter)

585
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,298
Go ahead, Pedro.

586
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,599
- [Pedro] Thank you so,
you changed my life.

587
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,567
Just wanted to
let you know that.

588
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,401
- Thank you.

589
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,771
- I'm an advertising
student and, I sit in class,

590
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:34,406
I'm in second year.

591
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,875
I'm so nervous, 
I sit in class and I--

592
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:37,876
- They teach you crap.

593
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:42,247
- [Pedro] Yeah, and I
learn more from you so,

594
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:45,384
I want to give
you value, but I want

595
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:50,022
an internship as well
so, if I can flip for you

596
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:52,057
on stage, could you
offer me an internship?

597
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,025
- No.

598
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:55,561
- [Pedro] No worries.

599
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:56,495
- A flip?

600
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,463
- [Pedro] Yeah.

601
00:24:57,463 --> 00:25:00,299
- Do you think you flipping
was enough value for me?

602
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,167
- [Pedro] I think it's
entertainment for you.

603
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,269
- Not for me, you
don't know me super well.

604
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,871
(audience laughter)

605
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:06,672
- [Pedro] Alright no worries,

606
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:07,639
I'll accept that
punch in the face.

607
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,442
- Let me tell you why I told
you no and let me tell you

608
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,276
where I want to go with it.

609
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,312
I wrote a book called
Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook.

610
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:18,050
I'm about to teach you more
about selling and marketing

611
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,651
right this second
than anything you'll learn

612
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,487
in any school ever.

613
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:22,554
- [Pedro] Thank you, tell me.

614
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:28,060
- When you give with
expectation in return, you lose.

615
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,097
(audience applause)

616
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:32,798
- [Pedro] Thank you.

617
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:34,833
- Jab, jab, jab, right hook,

618
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,703
is give, give, give, and
too many people interpret it

619
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,338
as take.

620
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:42,808
Jab, jab, jab, right hook is
give, give, give, and then ask.

621
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:45,377
And so that's the cadence,

622
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,846
especially when you're asking
for something as big time

623
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:48,981
as an internship
at Vayner that has

624
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,049
become super competitive,

625
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,317
that's when you've
gotta do your homework

626
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,285
on what the value is.

627
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,088
It's awesome that you can
do a flip and that would be

628
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:59,024
cool on camera
feels super selfish,

629
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,726
I feel like you
were gonna win twice.

630
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,362
You were gonna do a
rad ass flip onstage

631
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:05,631
and get an internship.

632
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:08,534
That's not only
giving with expectation,

633
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:10,269
that's asking twice.

634
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:12,805
That's why you get
a big fat no, Pedro.

635
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:15,207
- [Pedro] I appreciate it,
I appreciate it,

636
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:16,308
thank you, thank you.

637
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,177
(audience applause)

638
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:22,614
- Okay, okay we're gonna go
back to a Twitter question.

639
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:27,119
Give us one second
afterwards we'll allow it.

640
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,921
- Don't hack it, 
you'll lose too.

641
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,289
Next.

642
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,891
- We'll do a Twitter
question and then there'll be

643
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:36,161
some opportunity after so
this one comes from skeptic,

644
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,397
and this is a question I
know a lot of people have.

645
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:42,334
What is the future of VR for
music artists and we do have

646
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:46,338
some artists in the crowd
here some actual celebrities

647
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:49,107
so I'm sure they're all
very interested to hear.

648
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:52,811
- VR is the only platform that
exists that I know of that

649
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:57,316
has the potential to arbitrage
out the internet itself.

650
00:26:57,316 --> 00:27:01,119
Right, so if you 
really think about it.

651
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,222
Super VR-ed out.

652
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:08,093
He's right, but here's where
some of the VR friends that

653
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,795
I have aren't as happy with me.

654
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,931
I just think it's a good 15
to 25 years away because it's

655
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,633
massive consumer behavior.

656
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,736
It reminds me so much
of the internet in '92.

657
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:22,574
Right, we're still in 2017 we're
talking about 25 years later and

658
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:27,679
still only 30%, 15% of
stuff is bought online but,

659
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,781
when you think
about what VR actually is,

660
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:33,852
which is at scale you put
contact lenses in your eyes

661
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,487
and you live.

662
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,223
You live, you're just living.

663
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,025
And it's really no different
than the way you're living

664
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,193
through your phone right now.

665
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:43,829
Think about how much you go
to your phone and how much you

666
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,197
watch other people
go to their phone,

667
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:48,000
we're living already in VR.

668
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,301
It's called this.

669
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:51,970
It gets crazy different when
you put it over your eyes and

670
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:55,140
it all feels that way and so
the stuff I've been playing

671
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,809
with is so intense.

672
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:01,079
The first time I took off a
very substantially strong,

673
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:05,017
ahead of its time VR
set a year or so ago,

674
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:07,986
I'll never forget what I
said which really caught me

675
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,922
off guard 'cause it was
just a very natural reaction.

676
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:11,623
I took it off,

677
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,325
it was super HD,

678
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:16,261
the audio 'cause sound
is a big issue was on point,

679
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,499
the kids that were doing it
reminded me much more of the

680
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:24,803
internet kids that I grew up
with which is straight nerds.

681
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,706
Not like business guys that
want to be in it 'cause it's

682
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,842
cool right? And I just
remember taking off the headset

683
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,111
and I said,

684
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:36,782
"Holy crap why would
anybody ever take this off?"

685
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:39,751
And then I took a
step back and said oh man,

686
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:46,291
so I think what's
in it for musicians?

687
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:49,161
The same thing
that's in it for everybody.

688
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:51,129
Production companies
are gonna pop up,

689
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:54,366
produce experiences and it's
going to be the same thing

690
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:55,567
we just saw with the internet.

691
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,503
Somebody'll be the Amazon and
somebody'll be the YouTube.

692
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,939
It's the complete
reset of opportunity.

693
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:04,176
Some of the incumbents
from the internet age

694
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:05,344
will do a good job,

695
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:07,212
maybe YouTube does a
good job and stays as an

696
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,614
entertainment platform,

697
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:10,649
maybe two kids
here create the next

698
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,150
YouTube in that environment.

699
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,453
But the stakes are very high
and I will tell you a lot of

700
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:17,022
people in this room will be
very scared of it 'cause their

701
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:19,625
children will live in a world
where they never have to

702
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:21,393
physically move anywhere.

703
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:24,062
And that's gonna change our
world but I do think it's much

704
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:27,699
further away than
people think and so we'll see.

705
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,268
- [Woman] Awesome, and hopefully
there'll be some VR that helps

706
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,471
people move right you can
run like you're running the

707
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:33,705
Boston Marathon in Chicago.

708
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:36,408
- Yeah but I think we as
humans always worry about that

709
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:40,379
stuff like everyone's
talking about exercise,

710
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:43,081
we're healthier than ever.

711
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,050
Just because we're in our
phone all the time or play

712
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,351
video games all the time,

713
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:49,655
we're not talking about the
fact that we eat so much better.

714
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:51,490
We're not talking about
that so many people work out

715
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,792
every single day now.

716
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,128
Who's over 40 years
old raise your hands?

717
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,295
Great, good amount.

718
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,364
Remember, nobody was
healthy 20 years ago.

719
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:00,666
(audience laughter)

720
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:04,369
Like nobody everybody ate
Doritos and drank soda and

721
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:06,038
nobody went to the gym.

722
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:08,206
So we're taking
things in micro too much,

723
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,142
oh we gotta get
people healthier.

724
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,544
We're the healthiest
we've ever been and it is not

725
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:16,114
even close and just because
we're in the phone instead

726
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:19,451
of on a television and on
Nintendo doesn't mean we're

727
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:20,819
less healthy.

728
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,288
- [Woman] Totally, 
very, very true.

729
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:26,692
Okay let's go back
to an audience question.

730
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:30,896
Our mic picker will have
the responsibility there.

731
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,133
- [John] Gary, 
I've got a question for you.

732
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:35,967
- [Gary] What's your name man?

733
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,936
- [John] My name's John,
it's not as sexy as pedro.

734
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,071
- [Gary] No worries.

735
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,572
Did you say John?

736
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,307
- [John] I did.
- Okay, awesome.

737
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:44,976
- [John] I got a
question about ambition.

738
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,378
You talked about risk as well.

739
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:47,646
- Yes.

740
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:51,116
- [John] So for those of us
that dream big, what do you

741
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:54,820
know about
running a football team?

742
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,921
- Running a football team?

743
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:57,122
- [John] Or owning one

744
00:30:57,122 --> 00:31:00,625
versus having a family,
and then how do you equate

745
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,228
that over to the idea of
this, you know you talked

746
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:06,031
about this endless
ambition and that balance

747
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,899
that you're trying to strike.

748
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:12,070
The prioritization there,
I mean, those are two deep,

749
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,306
huge engagements, let
alone all the other businesses

750
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:15,140
that you have.

751
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,008
- Yeah, so hold on
to the mic, 'cause maybe

752
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:17,843
we'll clarify here.

753
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:20,479
So I think, I think one of
the biggest reasons I don't

754
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:24,449
tell anybody how to parent,
or how to map their ambition,

755
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:28,186
or give relationship advice,
is we all have different stuff.

756
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:31,356
The serendipity of my life, 
create a scenario where

757
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,592
the woman that I married
grew up in a household where

758
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:36,261
her father traveled
all the time, right.

759
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,196
She has the greatest
relationship with him.

760
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,564
They worked in extremes.

761
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,133
He worked a lot and
they vacationed a lot,

762
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:42,434
and things of that nature.

763
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,236
And I grew up in a very
similar household where,

764
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,804
mine was even more extreme.

765
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:49,508
There was no extremes, it was
one gear, all working and,

766
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:52,577
we're also a very
old school couple.

767
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,080
We're a little bit more
into dividing and conquering.

768
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,015
You know obviously we have
a whole lot of co-parenting

769
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,484
and things of that nature,
but, and I don't think

770
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,953
one's right or one's wrong,
I just know what Lizzie

771
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,756
and I are comfortable with,
and that's Lizzie and I.

772
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,626
And it's very cute and nice,
that there's lots of books

773
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:09,761
written about what we
should do, and it's very nice

774
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,430
that you have
opinions of how I should do it,

775
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,865
but I don't give a shit.

776
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:15,534
- [John] No but, I
want you to tell me

777
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:17,102
you struggle with that, maybe.

778
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:17,936
- But I don't.

779
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,505
- [John] Do you
struggle trying...okay (laughs).

780
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:21,473
Then I feel even worse.

781
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:22,741
- Let me tell you
what I struggle with,

782
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:23,942
if you're looking for something.

783
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,845
I struggle being
completely petrified of anybody

784
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:28,847
that I love dying.

785
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:30,248
Like crippled.

786
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:33,552
Like, when my mom goes to
the doctor, I can't think.

787
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:35,520
For a checkup.

788
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,122
That's what I struggle with.

789
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:40,559
After that, feels
very controllable.

790
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,195
It's binary for me brother.

791
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:45,530
You know, it's all I got.

792
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,600
(audience applause)

793
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,337
Because I'm not scared about
my kids not loving me, right.

794
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,339
Because I also know
there's so many yings and yangs.

795
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,408
I know that my
daughter is going with me

796
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:59,177
on two speaking
engagements, in the next year,

797
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,947
and that when I go speak in
Anaheim, I'll take the next

798
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:04,115
day off with her, and
we'll go to Disneyland

799
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:04,850
and have that time.

800
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,586
I don't remember
anything about what my parents

801
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:10,689
did with me from 10 to,
you know from six to 13,

802
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:13,225
other than the one time
my mom took me out of school,

803
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:16,161
on my birthday in fourth grade
and took me to the arcade.

804
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:19,364
People don't understand how
memory and the brain works.

805
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:20,832
And by the way, let
me remind all the parents

806
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,667
that feel great about
their work-life balance.

807
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:26,671
Coming home and being on
your phone and watching TV,

808
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,773
doesn't mean you're with them.

809
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,243
People confuse
quality and quantity.

810
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:32,878
(audience applause)

811
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:36,147
So, you know but, but
let me tell you something.

812
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:37,382
Things change man.

813
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:40,752
You know like, with all the
audacity that I just delivered

814
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:43,555
this with, I could walk into
my home seven months from now,

815
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:44,589
Lizzie could look me
in the face and says,

816
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,192
I'm done with this, too much.

817
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,594
And then I got a real
problem, 'cause then I have to

818
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:52,330
decide between two things I
can't breath without, you know?

819
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,732
And so I get it.
I get it.

820
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:56,201
I don't sit here thinking
I've got it all figured out,

821
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,370
and then life's
got twists and turns.

822
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,805
Everything's great,
until your child is diagnosed

823
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,507
with a life-threatening disease.

824
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:03,608
I promise you this.

825
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,677
If I ever shut my
mouth, it's only gonna be

826
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:07,512
because of the
health of my family.

827
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:10,916
If you ever don't see me
again, that's what I'm doing.

828
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:13,184
And I'll be back
when that's resolved.

829
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:17,155
But I'm not stressed by most
of the stuff in the middle,

830
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:20,292
especially in the current
political correctness POVs

831
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:23,460
of what we should be doing.

832
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,963
Cool.
(audience applause)

833
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:26,197
- [Woman] Awesome.

834
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,632
So, Gary, just
keeping on that note,

835
00:34:28,632 --> 00:34:30,534
how important do you
think it is to build like

836
00:34:30,534 --> 00:34:32,637
a really core team
around you, people that really

837
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,906
support you, and
understand the hustle?

838
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,275
- Imperative, but I
think the biggest core team

839
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:41,513
you need to create is
within your own brain.

840
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:43,514
- Can you explain
that a little further?

841
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:47,851
- If you're not your
biggest fan, you've lost.

842
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:49,321
- Amazing.
(audience applause)

843
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:51,389
We're going back to
Twitter for another question.

844
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,857
- And you know what,
let's stay on that for a minute.

845
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:53,591
- Sure.

846
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,994
- It's the big one.

847
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:57,429
It's the big one.

848
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,598
I think I give so much
'cause I actually think

849
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,634
I feel guilty that I was not
only gifted with the right DNA,

850
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:05,170
but I was parented so
perfectly that I could give

851
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,872
you that answer, because I
know almost every other person

852
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:10,075
I know doesn't have that
feeling about themselves,

853
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:13,445
and a whole lot of it
had to do with their mother,

854
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,481
or their dad, or
where they grew up.

855
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:20,986
So I feel, I feel,
enormous pain towards people

856
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:24,255
like my father, like a
lot of my best friends,

857
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:28,026
who weren't gifted with the
infrastructure of the household

858
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:31,029
that made them feel good about
themselves, but in return,

859
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:34,632
because their parents
were insecure, and sad inside,

860
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,867
they took it out
on their children,

861
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:40,171
and pointed out their flaws,
because misery loves company.

862
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:43,041
But I implore you,
if you're sitting with that,

863
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:45,210
in this audience, that
you need to figure out,

864
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,012
whether it's through
therapy, whether it's

865
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:49,080
with something else,
you've got to get that poison

866
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,683
out of your body, because if
you don't, you're just not,

867
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:53,685
you're just not going anywhere.

868
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:56,521
- [Woman] That actually leads
perfect into our next question,

869
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,023
and that comes
from Steven Gordon.

870
00:35:58,023 --> 00:36:01,292
I'm gonna paraphrase this
a little bit, but it says,

871
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,462
every speaker has preached
positivity, and along those

872
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,564
lines pretty much everyone
out there, they want to know,

873
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:08,800
is that the final
key to unlocking success?

874
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,102
And anyone who follows
Gary, which I'm sure that's

875
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,238
pretty much everyone in
here, we've heard you talk

876
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:16,174
a lot lately about gratitude
and becoming a real person.

877
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,275
- Yeah.

878
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:21,446
Yeah I mean look,
I mean, what are we doing here?

879
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:23,882
Like, of course, like.

880
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:26,651
It's so easy, I've been
talking about this more,

881
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,988
and I think, with the political
climate in the States and,

882
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:34,025
other places in the world,
it's easy to sell negativity.

883
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,428
It's easy to be cynical.

884
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:38,296
You're protecting your feelings.

885
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,832
You don't want to be tricked.

886
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,334
It's hard to sell positivity.

887
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:46,137
People are
poking at that always.

888
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,740
It feels better,
it's tough to see it

889
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,707
when you don't have it.

890
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,010
I'm empathetic to that.

891
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:56,281
But sure, I mean, I talk
a lot in business context,

892
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:59,150
but whether you're a
parent or, in government like,

893
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,920
what do you want to do?

894
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,423
Why else would you, like
go through life not trying

895
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:09,461
to achieve happiness and
so, yeah, I think of course

896
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:12,397
that's the ultimate
goal and, it's incredible

897
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,599
what happens when 
you feel good like,

898
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,801
everything's easy to 
deal with, John, you know?

899
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:19,737
Everything's easy to deal
with 'cause, it's just life.

900
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,841
It's real, you know
like, I don't think,

901
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:25,710
I think people dwell.

902
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,814
And I think dwelling is,

903
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:32,150
the wrong strategy.

904
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,685
- It's focusing on
the wrong things, right?

905
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:34,786
You gotta focus
on what they want.

906
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:35,754
- Let me tell you
who's willing to listen

907
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,689
to you complain.

908
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,624
The people that are willing 
to listen to you complain

909
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:43,895
and dwell, consistently, 
only look two parts.

910
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:46,164
They're your most
inner-family and they love you

911
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:50,335
to the ends of the Earth, 
or they're fellow loser friends.

912
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:54,305
(audience laughter and applause)

913
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,975
- Okay, awesome.

914
00:37:56,975 --> 00:38:00,745
Let's give some love
to the sides over here.

915
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:05,150
Let's get a audience question.

916
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:08,119
Over here somewhere.

917
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,454
- She's a righty.

918
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,688
Hey.
- [Woman 2] Hi Gary.

919
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,657
I know you tell
us in your videos,

920
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,259
go in all-in on your strengths.

921
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:15,894
All chips in
on your strengths,--

922
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:16,694
- [Gary] Yes.
- [Woman 2] don't focus on

923
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,096
your weaknesses.

924
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:20,799
What have you seen, though,
from students at VaynerMedia,

925
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:24,702
students with internships.
What are their weaknesses,

926
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:27,462
or what's missing from those
students and from those people

927
00:38:27,462 --> 00:38:30,388
that are asking for
that experience from you?

928
00:38:30,388 --> 00:38:31,723
Not so that I can work on it,

929
00:38:31,723 --> 00:38:33,858
but just so that I know
what people like you value

930
00:38:33,858 --> 00:38:34,893
and what you need.

931
00:38:34,893 --> 00:38:35,601
- I think everybody 
has different

932
00:38:35,601 --> 00:38:36,823
strengths and weaknesses.

933
00:38:36,823 --> 00:38:40,760
I break things up into black
and white and gray, EQ and IQ.

934
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,928
I think those are
the two pillars that

935
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:43,930
I look at when I look at somebody.

936
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:46,499
And some people have
hard skills out their ass.

937
00:38:46,499 --> 00:38:49,038
Right? They can do everything 
but they don't know how to

938
00:38:49,038 --> 00:38:50,602
interact with the 
other boys and girls,

939
00:38:50,602 --> 00:38:53,191
and that ultimately 
tumbles them. Right?

940
00:38:53,191 --> 00:38:55,235
So, the reason I started
talking about something called

941
00:38:55,235 --> 00:38:57,304
the Honey Empire
is that's what I want

942
00:38:57,304 --> 00:38:58,772
everybody at Vayner to know.

943
00:38:58,772 --> 00:39:00,607
In the beginning,
I valued honey more.

944
00:39:00,607 --> 00:39:01,875
That's why I call 
it Honey Empire.

945
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:03,977
So if you were a good
person and you could get along

946
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:06,997
with everybody else, you worked
at Vayner for quite a while.

947
00:39:06,997 --> 00:39:08,565
'Cause that was what I valued.

948
00:39:08,565 --> 00:39:11,802
We're now seven,
we're now bigger.

949
00:39:11,802 --> 00:39:13,891
If you've raised a child, 
you know things change,

950
00:39:13,891 --> 00:39:16,293
you expect more
as they get older,

951
00:39:16,293 --> 00:39:17,795
and so I expect
more of the organization.

952
00:39:17,795 --> 00:39:20,130
So we went through a tough
patch over the last six months

953
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,632
where I had to let
go of certain people

954
00:39:21,632 --> 00:39:24,268
because I deemed that they
didn't have the hard skills.

955
00:39:24,268 --> 00:39:26,073
The actual intellect,

956
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:28,080
the actually ability,
the output.

957
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,249
Crossing T's, dotting I's, 
black and white stuff.

958
00:39:30,249 --> 00:39:34,002
The math skills, the email
copy skills to have a client.

959
00:39:34,002 --> 00:39:36,835
The strategy skills to come
up with an idea that mattered.

960
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:38,870
And it was very
shocking to our company

961
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,173
and a lot of feelings got hurt,

962
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:44,843
but it's the right thing to do
because meritocracy matters.

963
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:48,080
If you don't do that,
the winning players leave.

964
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,684
And so I think most people
fall in one of two categories.

965
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:55,254
They're short in one of the
two and if they have both,

966
00:39:55,254 --> 00:39:58,657
they'll go on to win,
and if they have neither,

967
00:39:58,657 --> 00:39:59,791
they're in really deep shit.

968
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:00,926
- [Woman 2] Yeah, 
ultimately you need both,

969
00:40:00,926 --> 00:40:02,928
but I feel like a
lot of businesses say,

970
00:40:02,928 --> 00:40:04,233
oh it's all about 
the personality,

971
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:05,196
it's all about the EQ,

972
00:40:05,196 --> 00:40:06,930
it's all about those things.

973
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,899
Obviously you say you
were a D and an F student,

974
00:40:08,899 --> 00:40:11,068
you were able to
build your own empire, but

975
00:40:11,068 --> 00:40:13,637
showing up somewhere and
saying you have no skills

976
00:40:13,637 --> 00:40:15,950
but you have lots of EQ,
not gonna get you very far.

977
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,985
- Businesses don't hire on that.

978
00:40:17,985 --> 00:40:19,353
Nobody hires on that.

979
00:40:19,353 --> 00:40:20,721
That's why my
businesses grow so fast.

980
00:40:20,721 --> 00:40:22,423
I actually do
hire on that at first,

981
00:40:22,423 --> 00:40:24,525
so it creates a
cultural foundation

982
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:26,327
that allows me
to then do my thing

983
00:40:26,327 --> 00:40:28,228
but most, 
no business does that.

984
00:40:28,228 --> 00:40:30,064
Like, this many
businesses do that.

985
00:40:30,064 --> 00:40:33,367
They only hire on skills, 
they only hire on rÃ©sumÃ©.

986
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:35,936
They don't what I do and
like the Alex De Simone's

987
00:40:35,936 --> 00:40:37,271
Uber driver's
like, I want a job.

988
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:40,419
We're like, okay.
You know?

989
00:40:40,419 --> 00:40:42,522
If Pedro offered me
some Jets memorabilia,

990
00:40:42,522 --> 00:40:44,124
he'd have a job too.

991
00:40:44,124 --> 00:40:47,003
(audience laughter)

992
00:40:47,003 --> 00:40:49,768
So I think that, yeah.

993
00:40:49,768 --> 00:40:50,422
- [Woman 2] I'll be sure

994
00:40:50,422 --> 00:40:51,651
to find you some
Jets memorabilia.

995
00:40:51,651 --> 00:40:52,885
(Gary laughs)

996
00:40:52,885 --> 00:40:55,233
- I think you have
to reverse engineer

997
00:40:55,233 --> 00:40:57,309
the person that
you're selling to. Right?

998
00:40:57,309 --> 00:41:00,546
I think that people
that know me should speak to

999
00:41:00,546 --> 00:41:03,382
their EQ qualities, 'cause
they know I over-index on that.

1000
00:41:03,382 --> 00:41:06,018
But you shouldn't be mad at
a company that clearly points

1001
00:41:06,018 --> 00:41:08,454
to the fact that they
clearly hire on skill and IQ.

1002
00:41:08,454 --> 00:41:09,922
They want you to
have a piece of paper

1003
00:41:09,922 --> 00:41:12,558
from a bullcrap university that
says you can do this thing,

1004
00:41:12,558 --> 00:41:14,159
and don't be mad at them.

1005
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:15,461
That's what they want.

1006
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:19,031
And yes, I think you're 
very clear-minded,

1007
00:41:19,031 --> 00:41:21,667
but I don't feel bad for people
who are like, but they said.

1008
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:23,002
It doesn't matter, 
it's up to you

1009
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:26,705
to dissect and
decode what people say.

1010
00:41:26,705 --> 00:41:27,639
Everything on you.

1011
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:29,675
Everything's your fault.

1012
00:41:29,675 --> 00:41:30,843
You wanna really win in life?

1013
00:41:30,843 --> 00:41:31,910
You wanna get real happy?

1014
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,011
You know why I'm really happy?

1015
00:41:33,011 --> 00:41:36,108
'Cause I think
everything's my fault.

1016
00:41:38,398 --> 00:41:41,602
If I don't
like it, I can change.

1017
00:41:41,602 --> 00:41:42,359
President of the United States.

1018
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:44,978
I don't like it, I can move.

1019
00:41:44,978 --> 00:41:46,497
Like, what's
everybody's problem?

1020
00:41:46,497 --> 00:41:47,678
(audience laughter)

1021
00:41:47,678 --> 00:41:49,072
Adjust.

1022
00:41:49,072 --> 00:41:52,450
(audience applause)

1023
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,057
I mean that.

1024
00:41:54,057 --> 00:41:56,300
Meaning, I don't have
to agree with his politics.

1025
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,402
I'm just saying
that you're in charge.

1026
00:41:58,402 --> 00:42:02,383
And we are just not
historically contextualized.

1027
00:42:02,383 --> 00:42:05,278
I'm much happier
to deal through, you know,

1028
00:42:05,278 --> 00:42:06,587
political toughness

1029
00:42:06,587 --> 00:42:08,915
or economic downturn,

1030
00:42:08,915 --> 00:42:13,452
much cooler to deal
with than The Black Plague.

1031
00:42:13,452 --> 00:42:14,038
No, really!

1032
00:42:14,038 --> 00:42:16,570
I mean, like, somebody
dealt with The Black Plague.

1033
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:17,638
(audience laughter)

1034
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:20,004
Like, you have
relatives that died.

1035
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:23,121
I mean, I know it's
funny, but it's true.

1036
00:42:23,121 --> 00:42:24,372
And like, you know, so I mean,

1037
00:42:24,372 --> 00:42:26,345
I don't know, I just don't
know how to complain.

1038
00:42:26,345 --> 00:42:29,115
I always think
somebody has it worse.

1039
00:42:29,115 --> 00:42:31,350
And if somebody has it
worse, you need to shut up.

1040
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:34,211
Whoever is the 7.7, if
that's the number we're at,

1041
00:42:34,211 --> 00:42:36,259
whoever's in last place,

1042
00:42:36,259 --> 00:42:37,708
whoever that person is,

1043
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:40,615
if there was a
world chart ranking

1044
00:42:40,615 --> 00:42:43,697
and Sally was dead last,

1045
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:45,256
she can talk.

1046
00:42:45,256 --> 00:42:47,530
(audience laughter)

1047
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:48,769
(audience applause)

1048
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:51,212
- Okay, okay, awesome!

1049
00:42:51,212 --> 00:42:52,861
Everyone that
has my phone number,

1050
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,743
I appreciate you
calling me and texting me

1051
00:42:54,743 --> 00:42:56,745
trying to get a
question to Gary right now.

1052
00:42:56,745 --> 00:42:58,780
Unfortunately, I can't answer
your phone call, I'm sorry.

1053
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,845
We're gonna keep goin'.

1054
00:42:59,845 --> 00:43:00,715
- Can we do some more?

1055
00:43:00,715 --> 00:43:01,522
- Of course!

1056
00:43:01,522 --> 00:43:02,343
- I know we're
doing a wine tasting,

1057
00:43:02,343 --> 00:43:03,377
but can I sneak in a
couple more questions?

1058
00:43:03,377 --> 00:43:04,578
Yeah? Okay, awesome!

1059
00:43:04,578 --> 00:43:05,780
Let's keep going.

1060
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,671
Let's go to the left side.

1061
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:08,054
- Hold on, come
right over here, then.

1062
00:43:08,054 --> 00:43:09,426
You have the mic, so.

1063
00:43:09,426 --> 00:43:10,594
- [Amy] I don't know if it's--

1064
00:43:10,594 --> 00:43:11,595
Okay, it is working.
- Yeah, you're on.

1065
00:43:11,595 --> 00:43:13,759
- [Amy] Okay, I apologize.
My name's Amy.

1066
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:15,980
But I've only seen
two of your videos.

1067
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,149
I know everyone else
here pretty much knows you.

1068
00:43:18,149 --> 00:43:18,933
- [Gary] Watch this!

1069
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:20,367
How many people have
never seen any of my stuff?

1070
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:21,368
Raise your hands.

1071
00:43:21,368 --> 00:43:22,837
- [Amy] Oh, my god!
Way more than I thought, okay.

1072
00:43:22,837 --> 00:43:27,511
- One thing that's been
great about this talk is,

1073
00:43:27,511 --> 00:43:30,276
one more time, raise your hands?

1074
00:43:30,276 --> 00:43:31,945
One thing that's really great

1075
00:43:31,945 --> 00:43:34,385
is that I always
know that to be true.

1076
00:43:34,385 --> 00:43:35,103
- [Amy] Okay.

1077
00:43:35,103 --> 00:43:37,932
- You know what's amazing 
about having a huge ego?

1078
00:43:37,932 --> 00:43:41,022
When you balance it
with enormous humility.

1079
00:43:41,022 --> 00:43:41,862
- [Amy] That is true.

1080
00:43:41,862 --> 00:43:45,092
- I think 99.9% of the
world doesn't know who I am.

1081
00:43:45,092 --> 00:43:46,944
Those hands shocked
some people, not me.

1082
00:43:46,944 --> 00:43:48,846
That was actually better
than I thought, I'll take it.

1083
00:43:48,846 --> 00:43:50,628
- [Amy] That's awesome!
Well, a lot of my friends,

1084
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,210
like I've got a lot of
really high profile friends,

1085
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,486
and they love you,
they watch you all the time.

1086
00:43:55,486 --> 00:43:57,847
- [Gary] Yeah, 'cause I'm great.
(audience laughing)

1087
00:43:57,847 --> 00:43:59,305
- But when you
came up and spoke,

1088
00:43:59,305 --> 00:44:01,881
you kind of scared me and
excited me all at the same time.

1089
00:44:01,881 --> 00:44:03,697
You challenged
everything that I thought

1090
00:44:03,697 --> 00:44:05,466
and called me on my crap, right?

1091
00:44:05,466 --> 00:44:06,837
- [Gary] Yep!
- And I am,

1092
00:44:09,127 --> 00:44:11,696
I've struggled 
with this thing about,

1093
00:44:12,926 --> 00:44:13,845
I give from the heart,

1094
00:44:13,845 --> 00:44:15,079
give, give, give,

1095
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:16,738
and I'm about to do the jab,

1096
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:17,950
but at the same time
there's something in me

1097
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:19,251
that tells me that

1098
00:44:19,251 --> 00:44:21,486
well, it's not very good to do--

1099
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:26,470
- [Gary] Keep talkin', I'm here.

1100
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:28,639
You're scared for the ask?

1101
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:30,140
Well, let's start with something.
- Yeah.

1102
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,712
- [Gary] Do you believe 
in what you're selling?

1103
00:44:31,712 --> 00:44:33,471
- Oh my God, I believe 
more than anything.

1104
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:35,884
And I'm out to change the world,

1105
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:36,885
and I know I will.

1106
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:39,034
- Okay. So what 
are you asking for?

1107
00:44:39,034 --> 00:44:41,670
- I wasn't actually
coming to ask about that,

1108
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,773
I'm looking for,

1109
00:44:43,773 --> 00:44:45,953
I have habits that
aren't necessarily the best.

1110
00:44:45,953 --> 00:44:49,034
I spend my money on
education and business,

1111
00:44:49,034 --> 00:44:51,237
but I overspend.

1112
00:44:51,237 --> 00:44:53,370
I have put all my
stuff into my own thing,

1113
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,162
but I'm looking
for somebody to invest,

1114
00:44:55,162 --> 00:44:56,597
but also give me the,

1115
00:44:56,597 --> 00:44:58,026
and I'm not
necessarily asking you.

1116
00:44:58,026 --> 00:44:59,101
- [Gary] I can tell.
- Okay.

1117
00:44:59,101 --> 00:45:00,799
But what I'm
looking for is somebody

1118
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,871
who can guide me
through the process and say,

1119
00:45:02,871 --> 00:45:05,088
"Well, that's not a very
smart business decision."

1120
00:45:05,088 --> 00:45:06,122
- [Gary] What're
you looking to sell?

1121
00:45:06,122 --> 00:45:09,248
- [Amy] I sell affirming arts.

1122
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,677
So it's personal development
and creative arts combined.

1123
00:45:12,677 --> 00:45:14,146
- [Gary] You're selling
people your time and service

1124
00:45:14,146 --> 00:45:15,814
to make them better?

1125
00:45:15,814 --> 00:45:16,555
- Yes.
- [Gary] Okay.

1126
00:45:16,555 --> 00:45:17,977
- And products and
services to make them better.

1127
00:45:17,977 --> 00:45:19,858
- [Gary] Yep, yep.
- Yes.

1128
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:22,778
- [Gary] And so, you
aren't a good salesperson?

1129
00:45:22,778 --> 00:45:23,919
- [Amy] Not yet.
- Okay.

1130
00:45:23,919 --> 00:45:25,468
Will you ever be?

1131
00:45:25,468 --> 00:45:27,164
- Oh, God, yeah.
- [Gary] Why?

1132
00:45:27,164 --> 00:45:29,592
- Because I want to.
- [Gary] That's not good enough.

1133
00:45:29,592 --> 00:45:31,614
- Because I go out and do it.

1134
00:45:31,614 --> 00:45:33,583
I don't watch your videos
because I'm actually learning,

1135
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:37,011
taking training, I've just
recently created the product

1136
00:45:37,011 --> 00:45:40,894
and I'm finding out
where to put them all.

1137
00:45:40,894 --> 00:45:43,467
My marketing, I do
want to empower the world,

1138
00:45:43,467 --> 00:45:46,820
so I'm doing a world
empowerment now movement.

1139
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,855
- Yep.

1140
00:45:47,855 --> 00:45:49,513
- [Amy] Planning to go for a
Guinness Book of World Records.

1141
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:50,481
- But you need a partner?

1142
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:51,482
- [Amy] I have a partner,

1143
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,084
but I don't have
a financial partner.

1144
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,821
I have somebody
who's been working with me

1145
00:45:54,821 --> 00:45:56,256
but I've been paying.

1146
00:45:56,256 --> 00:45:58,037
- [Gary] You need an accountant?

1147
00:45:58,037 --> 00:46:01,948
- No, I need somebody to invest.

1148
00:46:01,948 --> 00:46:02,982
- [Gary] You need money.

1149
00:46:02,982 --> 00:46:04,103
- I need money, 
I need capital.

1150
00:46:04,103 --> 00:46:07,081
- [Gary] Why?

1151
00:46:07,081 --> 00:46:09,457
- Just to keep
her on long enough

1152
00:46:09,457 --> 00:46:11,864
for us to go
through and do this.

1153
00:46:11,864 --> 00:46:15,719
- So, how much
money do you need?

1154
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:17,748
- [Amy] Not even 50,000.

1155
00:46:17,748 --> 00:46:19,616
- Is that a dollar?

1156
00:46:19,616 --> 00:46:20,617
- [Amy] Dollars.

1157
00:46:20,617 --> 00:46:21,852
(Gary laughs)

1158
00:46:21,852 --> 00:46:23,020
- So I don't know--

1159
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,088
- [Amy] And then, I wasn't
even intending to say this.

1160
00:46:25,088 --> 00:46:26,056
- Yeah, no worries.

1161
00:46:26,056 --> 00:46:27,090
- [Amy] I just had this insight

1162
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:28,492
that I had to have a
conversation with you.

1163
00:46:28,492 --> 00:46:29,273
- I'm glad.

1164
00:46:29,273 --> 00:46:33,014
Look, I think you have to sell
somebody to give you money.

1165
00:46:33,014 --> 00:46:34,854
- [Amy] Okay.
- So you should go do that.

1166
00:46:34,854 --> 00:46:37,056
- [Amy] Alright, I am
researching angel investors.

1167
00:46:37,056 --> 00:46:41,476
Are there any angel
investors in this group?

1168
00:46:41,476 --> 00:46:43,164
Not one?

1169
00:46:43,164 --> 00:46:44,165
Alright.

1170
00:46:44,165 --> 00:46:44,970
- [Gary] There's
people with money.

1171
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,571
They're just people
that didn't like your pitch.

1172
00:46:46,571 --> 00:46:47,806
(audience laughter)

1173
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:48,974
- Okay, that's true.

1174
00:46:48,974 --> 00:46:51,612
- [Gary] So what's important,
what's important,

1175
00:46:51,612 --> 00:46:53,127
and I'm not
saying that to razz you,

1176
00:46:53,127 --> 00:46:56,730
what's important is to
figure out how to define it

1177
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,395
so that there are people that
do want to raise their hand,

1178
00:46:58,395 --> 00:46:59,663
and do want to do that.

1179
00:46:59,663 --> 00:47:01,966
And more importantly, 
I would tell you,

1180
00:47:01,966 --> 00:47:03,297
it's really easy
to get to people.

1181
00:47:03,297 --> 00:47:04,598
So, here's what 
I would do if I were you,

1182
00:47:04,598 --> 00:47:07,868
I would put together
your deck, how you explain it,

1183
00:47:07,868 --> 00:47:09,804
maybe it's a video
'cause you articulate well,

1184
00:47:09,804 --> 00:47:11,785
however you want
to communicate it,

1185
00:47:11,785 --> 00:47:13,879
and I would relentlessly ask.

1186
00:47:13,879 --> 00:47:14,743
- [Amy] Okay.

1187
00:47:14,743 --> 00:47:17,829
I will make a video and
I will relentlessly ask.

1188
00:47:17,829 --> 00:47:19,248
- Yeah, I mean
that's what you do.

1189
00:47:19,248 --> 00:47:21,085
- Great, thank you.
- [Gary] Good luck, awesome.

1190
00:47:21,085 --> 00:47:22,653
(audience applause)

1191
00:47:22,653 --> 00:47:24,799
- [Woman] Thank you, thank you.

1192
00:47:24,799 --> 00:47:27,235
Let's go back here somewhere

1193
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:30,543
and get a little
love to this area.

1194
00:47:30,543 --> 00:47:32,852
Left side.

1195
00:47:32,852 --> 00:47:34,889
- [Amir] Perfect. 
Check, oh okay.

1196
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:37,282
So my name is Amir and 
I actually work for the

1197
00:47:37,282 --> 00:47:39,561
co-founders of Elite Daily so
I'm sure you've heard,--

1198
00:47:39,561 --> 00:47:40,562
- [Gary] Awesome
man, yeah, congrats.

1199
00:47:40,562 --> 00:47:42,697
- out of New York, 
so my question is,

1200
00:47:42,697 --> 00:47:45,461
I know you're kind of
showcasing that you're working

1201
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:47,797
really hard and through social
media Instagram, SnapChat,

1202
00:47:47,797 --> 00:47:49,666
you're outworking everyone.

1203
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,034
But what's the end goal like,

1204
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,936
why are you doing the
60 Second Club or the

1205
00:47:53,936 --> 00:47:56,197
Five Minute Club,

1206
00:47:56,197 --> 00:47:57,736
where do you see
that in one year?

1207
00:47:57,736 --> 00:47:59,481
Is that some sort of proof
of concept with your clients?

1208
00:47:59,481 --> 00:48:01,383
- [Gary] Yeah, 
I'm always testing,

1209
00:48:01,383 --> 00:48:04,253
everything I do is
always learning behavior right?

1210
00:48:04,253 --> 00:48:06,945
To me, it was when 
I decided that Instagram was

1211
00:48:06,945 --> 00:48:09,080
disproportionately
getting the attention,

1212
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,416
I wanted to understand
what was the right cadence to

1213
00:48:11,416 --> 00:48:14,019
create notification turn on 
and how do I bring value

1214
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:16,531
in return for it and
what's the right value prop of

1215
00:48:16,531 --> 00:48:17,403
returning it?

1216
00:48:17,403 --> 00:48:19,939
And then I saw that a lot
of people were posting but

1217
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:21,507
was that bringing value to
the community which was why

1218
00:48:21,507 --> 00:48:23,375
I shifted it to
Five Minute Club,

1219
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:26,111
and then I realized like
neither was really bringing value

1220
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,672
but the 60 Second Club 
brought a sense of urgency and

1221
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:31,029
fun to people like tens
of thousands of them,

1222
00:48:31,029 --> 00:48:32,648
so I said let's switch it back.

1223
00:48:32,648 --> 00:48:35,115
Those are just 
micro, micro-tactics

1224
00:48:35,115 --> 00:48:36,059
in me learning things

1225
00:48:36,059 --> 00:48:37,341
that could
eventually help clients,

1226
00:48:37,341 --> 00:48:38,476
could help Wine Library,

1227
00:48:38,476 --> 00:48:40,407
and just I'm an
entrepreneur, right?

1228
00:48:40,407 --> 00:48:44,345
So the end goal is to be on the
journey of entrepreneurship.

1229
00:48:44,345 --> 00:48:46,547
I'm a risk taker. I like
doing different things.

1230
00:48:46,547 --> 00:48:49,202
I don't like settling for 
the same old thing and so

1231
00:48:49,202 --> 00:48:52,483
those are just tactics
of trying to learn different

1232
00:48:52,483 --> 00:48:54,818
platforms and capabilities
and trying to understand the

1233
00:48:54,818 --> 00:48:57,688
learnings from the behavior 
of people reacting to it.

1234
00:48:57,688 --> 00:48:59,122
- [Amir] So there's 
no really end goal,

1235
00:48:59,122 --> 00:49:01,959
is there an end goal
that in one year through this,--

1236
00:49:01,959 --> 00:49:05,755
- [Gary] No, I have zero 
micro-end goals like that, zero.

1237
00:49:05,755 --> 00:49:07,402
Zero, zero.

1238
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:09,705
I never ever, ever, ever think,

1239
00:49:09,705 --> 00:49:12,741
I've never said that 
in one year, you know,

1240
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:13,448
I don't have that goal.

1241
00:49:13,448 --> 00:49:17,619
I have one macro 
goal which is to

1242
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:21,922
feel like I left 
it on the field

1243
00:49:21,922 --> 00:49:24,429
is probably the 
best way I could put it.

1244
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:27,190
You know, I'm sure all of us
have different versions of this,

1245
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:28,825
I just have this feeling,

1246
00:49:28,825 --> 00:49:31,361
it's like moth
to the light, right?

1247
00:49:31,361 --> 00:49:32,863
I couldn't even
really explain it.

1248
00:49:32,863 --> 00:49:35,499
It's why I'm so comfortable
in it because it's been there

1249
00:49:35,499 --> 00:49:37,467
long before this.

1250
00:49:37,467 --> 00:49:39,803
20 years before the
internet it was there,

1251
00:49:39,803 --> 00:49:41,905
do you know what I mean?
It's just always been there.

1252
00:49:41,905 --> 00:49:45,478
I don't know why every single
weekend instead of playing

1253
00:49:45,478 --> 00:49:49,160
with my friends I wanted to
make my friends work with me

1254
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,281
and wash cars. I mean
my poor friends that are

1255
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:52,399
now coming out
of the woodworks,

1256
00:49:52,399 --> 00:49:54,234
I forgot how many of
them I made do things.

1257
00:49:54,234 --> 00:49:56,269
I don't talk about the
shoveling snow and the car wash

1258
00:49:56,269 --> 00:49:59,272
business and the miniature 
golf course I built in my

1259
00:49:59,272 --> 00:50:02,905
friend's backyard I don't
talk about those things often,

1260
00:50:02,905 --> 00:50:06,550
but it's just who I am.

1261
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:10,727
Same way people need to sing
or same way people need to cook

1262
00:50:10,727 --> 00:50:13,800
every night just need to cook.

1263
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,162
I just need to business.

1264
00:50:16,162 --> 00:50:17,902
(audience laughter)

1265
00:50:17,902 --> 00:50:20,703
- [Amir] Do you think that kind
of sends a message to your

1266
00:50:20,703 --> 00:50:23,763
audience for
them to do the same.

1267
00:50:23,763 --> 00:50:26,733
You see you're following you're
posting this I'm working,

1268
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:29,872
do you think that kind
of might create some deceit,

1269
00:50:29,872 --> 00:50:31,921
deceive their audience
that it's actual fake work

1270
00:50:31,921 --> 00:50:35,392
than real work 'cause my
ideology is I don't need to

1271
00:50:35,392 --> 00:50:36,793
SnapChat, I don't 
need to Instagram

1272
00:50:36,793 --> 00:50:38,094
to show that I'm working.
- [Gary] Yeah.

1273
00:50:38,094 --> 00:50:39,629
- I'm working when
I'm not on there.

1274
00:50:39,629 --> 00:50:41,715
So I feel like there's
more wannabe-preneurs

1275
00:50:41,715 --> 00:50:42,732
that are 
actually doing that.

1276
00:50:42,732 --> 00:50:43,984
- [Gary] Of course, 
of course.

1277
00:50:43,984 --> 00:50:45,248
I think for me,

1278
00:50:45,248 --> 00:50:48,714
I have the right balance
of wanting to give back and

1279
00:50:48,714 --> 00:50:51,210
a lot of selfishness
to have the attention

1280
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:53,145
and it works in my favor.

1281
00:50:53,145 --> 00:50:54,568
Because I feel good about both.

1282
00:50:54,568 --> 00:50:58,243
I love the attention and
I have that narcissistic DNA

1283
00:50:58,243 --> 00:50:59,707
and I love it,
I love taking selfies,

1284
00:50:59,707 --> 00:51:03,344
I love people.
Of course I would love it.

1285
00:51:03,344 --> 00:51:04,582
It feels nice.

1286
00:51:04,582 --> 00:51:07,061
My mom loved me so much
and complimented me every day

1287
00:51:07,061 --> 00:51:09,280
so much that when 
I left the house I was like,

1288
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,149
fuck this, I need more of that.

1289
00:51:11,149 --> 00:51:12,290
(audience laughter)

1290
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:13,491
So I need that,

1291
00:51:13,491 --> 00:51:14,926
that's why I do it.

1292
00:51:14,926 --> 00:51:16,428
I'm also not scared.

1293
00:51:16,428 --> 00:51:18,163
A lot of my friends who don't
put themselves out there,

1294
00:51:18,163 --> 00:51:19,998
they don't want themselves out
there because there's things

1295
00:51:19,998 --> 00:51:22,447
that they don't want people 
to uncover about them so

1296
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:24,649
I'm not scared. That happens,

1297
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:29,666
and it feels really good
getting 100 emails a day from

1298
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:33,347
people whose lives are way
better because they stumbled on

1299
00:51:33,347 --> 00:51:36,053
some of your videos and
that's something that my quiet

1300
00:51:36,053 --> 00:51:39,423
friends who don't need that
who just need to build and

1301
00:51:39,423 --> 00:51:41,659
do their business, 
they don't have that feeling.

1302
00:51:41,659 --> 00:51:43,461
So when my friends who tell me,

1303
00:51:43,461 --> 00:51:47,284
my God if you put this
energy into your full-time,

1304
00:51:47,284 --> 00:51:50,210
my friends will say things like
if people knew that GaryVee

1305
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,945
was your side hustle,

1306
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:54,675
if people knew how
much you're actually,

1307
00:51:54,675 --> 00:51:56,337
if you actually took all that
time and energy and put it

1308
00:51:56,337 --> 00:51:57,972
into your business you
wouldn't be doing $100 million,

1309
00:51:57,972 --> 00:51:59,741
you'd be doing $200 million.

1310
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,342
And I always reply with
the same thing I'm like,

1311
00:52:01,342 --> 00:52:05,952
yeah but my legacy's
way better than yours.

1312
00:52:05,952 --> 00:52:07,600
You know and so you probably
know this after the exit of your

1313
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,745
business it's crazy,

1314
00:52:09,745 --> 00:52:13,069
money after awhile
like how much do you need?

1315
00:52:13,069 --> 00:52:17,100
I don't know. I don't buy
shit like I don't need stuff.

1316
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,401
- [Amir] It didn't 
change anything,

1317
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:20,457
the co-founders 
lives stay the same.

1318
00:52:20,457 --> 00:52:21,992
- [Gary] Yeah, so you 
know how it is.

1319
00:52:21,992 --> 00:52:24,161
And by the way I'm pumped
for people who their whole

1320
00:52:24,161 --> 00:52:27,574
life wanted a Lamborghini
and worked hard and got one,

1321
00:52:27,574 --> 00:52:29,542
good for them.

1322
00:52:29,542 --> 00:52:32,775
I don't judge other people's
stuff and I definitely don't

1323
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:35,378
care how I'm being judged.

1324
00:52:35,378 --> 00:52:36,345
Cool.

1325
00:52:36,345 --> 00:52:38,047
(audience applause)

1326
00:52:38,047 --> 00:52:39,782
- [Woman] Amazing, amazing, 
and when you get to a certain

1327
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:42,619
level you get people wearing
shirts with your face on it.

1328
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:44,424
See Gary's face over 
here on a t-shirt.

1329
00:52:44,424 --> 00:52:46,025
- You want to talk
about narcissistic.

1330
00:52:46,025 --> 00:52:48,878
- GaryVeeShop.com
people, check it out.

1331
00:52:48,878 --> 00:52:50,179
Shirts like this.

1332
00:52:50,179 --> 00:52:52,848
We're gonna do one final
question I'm so sorry that

1333
00:52:52,848 --> 00:52:55,217
we have to wrap this up,

1334
00:52:55,217 --> 00:52:58,613
we have a final question 
over here somewhere?

1335
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:03,325
Okay I think they're gonna
come on stage to ask you the

1336
00:53:03,325 --> 00:53:04,159
question actually.

1337
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:05,310
- Okay.

1338
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,343
- Yeah, yeah, give
it up for GaryVee.

1339
00:53:11,343 --> 00:53:13,345
Hello, James Erdt here.

1340
00:53:13,345 --> 00:53:14,617
- How are you?
- Chair of the board for

1341
00:53:14,617 --> 00:53:16,999
Reviver Ranch for At-Risk Kids.

1342
00:53:16,999 --> 00:53:18,347
- How are you?
- Very good.

1343
00:53:18,347 --> 00:53:19,511
Very grateful.

1344
00:53:19,511 --> 00:53:22,147
So I'm coming here with a
pure attitude of gratitude.

1345
00:53:22,147 --> 00:53:24,282
To thank you and
your organization.

1346
00:53:24,282 --> 00:53:28,420
We have an original
15,000 dollar splotchy couture,

1347
00:53:29,732 --> 00:53:32,829
made out of
automotive paint from a 911,

1348
00:53:32,829 --> 00:53:34,918
from the different layers, 
we can explain it later.

1349
00:53:34,918 --> 00:53:36,920
It comes with a
certificate of authenticity,

1350
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,322
and we just wanted to
offer it to you as a thank you.

1351
00:53:39,322 --> 00:53:40,457
- Thank you, my friend.

1352
00:53:40,457 --> 00:53:41,373
(audience applause)

1353
00:53:41,373 --> 00:53:43,074
It's good to see ya.
How you been?

1354
00:53:43,074 --> 00:53:44,335
- Good.
- Good.

1355
00:53:52,871 --> 00:53:55,377
- Alright, I don't need a mic, 
I'm a theater performer.

1356
00:53:55,377 --> 00:53:56,245
There we are.

1357
00:53:56,245 --> 00:53:57,413
Gary, thank you so much.

1358
00:53:57,413 --> 00:53:59,014
How about it,
GaryVee everybody!

1359
00:53:59,014 --> 00:54:02,947
(audience applause and cheers)

1360
00:54:02,947 --> 00:54:04,330
Now.

1361
00:54:10,576 --> 00:54:14,282
We're not quite
done with you yet.

1362
00:54:14,282 --> 00:54:15,116
You know that,

1363
00:54:15,116 --> 00:54:16,050
because you
mentioned it earlier,

1364
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:17,151
you couldn't wait
to get to this part,

1365
00:54:17,151 --> 00:54:20,087
because of the amazing success

1366
00:54:20,087 --> 00:54:23,057
that all got launched
through wine and spirits,

1367
00:54:23,057 --> 00:54:24,710
we have Richard Slingerland

1368
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:26,345
is gonna join us
on stage right now,

1369
00:54:26,345 --> 00:54:28,880
from Pillitteri Estates Winery,

1370
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,750
and I say we have
ourselves a wine test!

1371
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:33,986
(audience applause)

1372
00:54:37,243 --> 00:54:39,944
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

1373
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:42,372
Alright, so I'm very
happy to be here today.

1374
00:54:42,372 --> 00:54:43,980
Everyone can hear me okay?

1375
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,682
Alright, awesome.

1376
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:47,851
So I'm really excited because

1377
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:49,086
I'm a Pillitteri family member,

1378
00:54:49,086 --> 00:54:51,655
for Pillitteri Estates Winery
in Niagara-on-the-Lake.

1379
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:53,156
My job is a very difficult job.

1380
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:56,960
I get to taste wine
with people for a living.

1381
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,028
The Niagara wine region,

1382
00:54:58,028 --> 00:54:59,329
I know a lot of you
have been to our winery,

1383
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:00,263
or around here.

1384
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:01,498
It's really been incredible,

1385
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:04,201
how much it's grown
over the last 20, 30 years.

1386
00:55:04,201 --> 00:55:05,535
It's hard to believe
when our winery opened,

1387
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:07,838
there was only 16
wineries in Ontario.

1388
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:10,107
Now there's over 220.

1389
00:55:10,107 --> 00:55:11,808
As well, I've mentioned 
to a few people before,

1390
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,810
we're actually the
second most traveled

1391
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:14,995
wine route in the world.

1392
00:55:14,995 --> 00:55:17,531
Only second to
Napa Valley, California.

1393
00:55:17,531 --> 00:55:19,933
So the tourism that
we get is incredible,

1394
00:55:19,933 --> 00:55:22,775
but we're still trying to
promote our wines worldwide,

1395
00:55:22,775 --> 00:55:25,411
and to make a real
name for ourselves.

1396
00:55:25,411 --> 00:55:26,245
So I thought it'd be really fun

1397
00:55:26,245 --> 00:55:27,547
to try some wines together.

1398
00:55:27,547 --> 00:55:29,148
- [Gary] Thrilled to do it.

1399
00:55:29,148 --> 00:55:31,534
- And I imagine you still
drink wine from time to time.

1400
00:55:31,534 --> 00:55:32,632
- [Gary] Once in a blue moon.

1401
00:55:32,632 --> 00:55:33,466
- Okay.

1402
00:55:34,446 --> 00:55:36,115
- [Gary] Cool.

1403
00:55:36,115 --> 00:55:37,816
- So we have a few wines here,

1404
00:55:37,816 --> 00:55:39,718
from Pillitteri
Winery, of course,

1405
00:55:39,718 --> 00:55:41,120
my family business.

1406
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,888
And we're going to
also do some sparkling wine

1407
00:55:42,888 --> 00:55:44,456
from Jackson-Triggs.

1408
00:55:44,456 --> 00:55:48,160
Now I wanted to just jump
right into a big, juicy red.

1409
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,330
For our winery, we're very proud
of every wine that we make.

1410
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:54,724
But when we're
tasting wine together today,

1411
00:55:54,724 --> 00:55:56,426
what I really wanna do is just,

1412
00:55:56,426 --> 00:55:59,335
see if you can notice some
difference in characteristics,

1413
00:55:59,335 --> 00:56:01,728
and if you can really pick out,

1414
00:56:01,728 --> 00:56:03,163
maybe what grape
this is for example.

1415
00:56:03,163 --> 00:56:03,997
What a fun game.

1416
00:56:03,997 --> 00:56:06,915
I get to play guess which
grape this is with GaryVee.

1417
00:56:06,915 --> 00:56:08,174
(audience laughter)

1418
00:56:08,174 --> 00:56:09,576
- Alright, let's see.

1419
00:56:09,576 --> 00:56:11,077
- Single varietal.

1420
00:56:11,077 --> 00:56:14,981
- Okay. So on the sniffy
sniff, as I used to call it,

1421
00:56:17,221 --> 00:56:20,421
there's a little
hint of blackberry.

1422
00:56:20,421 --> 00:56:24,455
There's a little charcoal
kind of actual aspect to it.

1423
00:56:24,455 --> 00:56:26,658
I'm getting a little 
vegetal on the nose,

1424
00:56:26,658 --> 00:56:28,760
so let's give it a whirl.

1425
00:56:35,484 --> 00:56:36,452
It's pretty good.

1426
00:56:36,452 --> 00:56:37,286
- [Richard] Thank you.

1427
00:56:37,286 --> 00:56:40,292
(audience laughter)

1428
00:56:40,292 --> 00:56:41,126
- I was pumped.

1429
00:56:41,126 --> 00:56:43,391
I was like, I'm gonna
destroy his wine in his face.

1430
00:56:43,391 --> 00:56:45,019
(audience laughter)

1431
00:56:45,019 --> 00:56:46,354
But it's pretty good.

1432
00:56:46,354 --> 00:56:47,255
Very clean.

1433
00:56:48,932 --> 00:56:50,324
Nice tannins.

1434
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:51,928
You know, really sweet tannins,

1435
00:56:51,928 --> 00:56:53,463
which I'm sure makes.

1436
00:56:53,463 --> 00:56:56,199
How many people drink wine?

1437
00:56:56,199 --> 00:56:57,334
Great, so.

1438
00:56:57,334 --> 00:56:59,036
The one big
thing with red wines,

1439
00:56:59,036 --> 00:57:00,871
the reason it takes
people time to get used to it,

1440
00:57:00,871 --> 00:57:02,406
is that bitter
taste on the back end,

1441
00:57:02,406 --> 00:57:05,909
the skins from the
grape, the tannins.

1442
00:57:05,909 --> 00:57:09,179
This has like
Cabernet Franc characteristics.

1443
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:10,814
- It's 100% Cabernet Franc.

1444
00:57:10,814 --> 00:57:14,117
(audience applause and cheers)

1445
00:57:14,117 --> 00:57:17,289
- Guys, long before I was
cool in the business world,

1446
00:57:17,289 --> 00:57:19,057
I was cool in the wine world.

1447
00:57:19,057 --> 00:57:21,026
I've got other talents.

1448
00:57:21,026 --> 00:57:23,562
Nice, yeah, it feels like
a really strong cab franc.

1449
00:57:23,562 --> 00:57:26,565
So I love Loire Valley reds,

1450
00:57:26,565 --> 00:57:28,700
which are cabernet franc based.

1451
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,302
They're more
vegetal than this is,

1452
00:57:30,302 --> 00:57:31,239
this is a little more fruit.

1453
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,742
But the reason I was able to
kind of distinct the varietal,

1454
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:38,480
was because the
California cabernet franc craze,

1455
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,682
has more sunshine to it.

1456
00:57:40,682 --> 00:57:43,418
I was a little confused because
the weather patterns here,

1457
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,853
so it just speaks to
the quality of the grapes,

1458
00:57:44,853 --> 00:57:45,954
which I think is
a great indication

1459
00:57:45,954 --> 00:57:47,089
of what you guys are doing.

1460
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:48,056
- Yeah thank you.

1461
00:57:48,056 --> 00:57:50,025
So cabernet franc, for those
of you guys who didn't know,

1462
00:57:50,025 --> 00:57:51,059
is actually one of the most

1463
00:57:51,059 --> 00:57:52,861
widely planted
grapes here in Ontario,

1464
00:57:52,861 --> 00:57:54,596
because it ripens so well.

1465
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,532
It ripens at about, end
of October, mid October.

1466
00:57:57,532 --> 00:57:59,835
And for us this
is a 2012 reserve.

1467
00:57:59,835 --> 00:58:02,423
We do 24 months in
French oak barrels,

1468
00:58:02,423 --> 00:58:04,309
and it's our premium red wine

1469
00:58:04,309 --> 00:58:06,311
that we've been
showcasing all around the world.

1470
00:58:06,311 --> 00:58:07,646
So obviously when
I'm going, you know,

1471
00:58:07,646 --> 00:58:09,581
China, Japan, Germany,

1472
00:58:09,581 --> 00:58:11,449
we export a third of
our products overseas,

1473
00:58:11,449 --> 00:58:12,717
which is pretty amazing.

1474
00:58:12,717 --> 00:58:14,819
35 different countries in total.

1475
00:58:14,819 --> 00:58:16,888
Cabernet Franc has
always been our number one red,

1476
00:58:16,888 --> 00:58:17,822
so I'm glad you picked it out,

1477
00:58:17,822 --> 00:58:19,524
and you really enjoyed it.

1478
00:58:19,524 --> 00:58:21,026
In terms of the
next wine we have,

1479
00:58:21,026 --> 00:58:24,763
this is a sparkling wine
from Jackson-Triggs.

1480
00:58:24,763 --> 00:58:26,202
- While you open that
let me just say one thing

1481
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:27,466
while we're wine nerding it out.

1482
00:58:27,466 --> 00:58:28,467
Here is the.

1483
00:58:30,245 --> 00:58:33,085
I was starting to
pen the book in my head,

1484
00:58:33,085 --> 00:58:34,419
which is how I do it.

1485
00:58:34,419 --> 00:58:37,222
I was gonna come
out with the wine diet,

1486
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,424
which was gonna talk about how

1487
00:58:39,424 --> 00:58:42,094
I basically watched
anybody who came from being

1488
00:58:42,094 --> 00:58:44,396
somewhat into wine
and interested in wine,

1489
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:45,731
to really getting
to a place where they

1490
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,499
loved it and
enjoyed it quite a bit.

1491
00:58:47,499 --> 00:58:51,470
And the whole
concept was predicated on.

1492
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:52,991
The fact of
the matter is, again,

1493
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:55,627
how many people here drink
wine multiple times a week,

1494
00:58:55,627 --> 00:58:57,362
raise your hands,
just to get a sense.

1495
00:58:57,362 --> 00:58:58,563
Here's the thing--

1496
00:58:58,563 --> 00:58:59,898
Buncha alcoholics around here.

1497
00:58:59,898 --> 00:59:01,600
(audience laughter)

1498
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,568
The big thing
that happens in wine

1499
00:59:03,568 --> 00:59:08,553
is people find a wine they
like, either a brand or a type,

1500
00:59:08,553 --> 00:59:11,832
and they drink it for
the rest of their lives.

1501
00:59:11,832 --> 00:59:13,567
They drink,
whether it's Cabernet Franc

1502
00:59:13,567 --> 00:59:14,835
or whether it's Jackson-Triggs

1503
00:59:14,835 --> 00:59:16,403
or whether it's Chardonnay,

1504
00:59:16,403 --> 00:59:18,302
they just drink it forever.

1505
00:59:18,302 --> 00:59:20,838
And so the wine diet
was gonna be forcing people

1506
00:59:20,838 --> 00:59:25,629
to drink 365 different
types of wine in one year.

1507
00:59:25,629 --> 00:59:27,464
If you're genuinely 
getting into wine

1508
00:59:27,464 --> 00:59:30,267
or wanna get more
into it, the number one way

1509
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:33,971
to really become someone
who can really appreciate it

1510
00:59:33,971 --> 00:59:36,073
is to force yourself to try

1511
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:38,041
different wines
from different regions.

1512
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:39,710
So Cabernet
Sauvignon from California

1513
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,812
is gonna act differently 
than one from Australia,

1514
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:44,982
and then trying grape
varietals like Petit Verdot

1515
00:59:44,982 --> 00:59:48,542
or Chenin Blanc or
a Malbec from Cahors

1516
00:59:48,542 --> 00:59:50,410
is gonna be
different than Argentina.

1517
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:54,081
If you really wanna get there,
that's the way to do it.

1518
00:59:54,081 --> 00:59:54,915
- [Robert] Alight.
- Cool.

1519
00:59:54,915 --> 00:59:57,351
- [Robert] So sparkling wine is
what we're gonna jump to next,

1520
00:59:57,351 --> 00:59:59,086
and everyone
loves sparkling wine.

1521
00:59:59,086 --> 01:00:00,614
It's one of those easy wines

1522
01:00:00,614 --> 01:00:01,509
I find a lot of
people can get into.

1523
01:00:01,509 --> 01:00:02,883
- Who here doesn't
like sparkling wine

1524
01:00:02,883 --> 01:00:04,284
or champagne, raise your hands.

1525
01:00:04,284 --> 01:00:04,859
- Oh, that's a few.

1526
01:00:04,859 --> 01:00:05,593
- Not everybody
likes sparkling wine.

1527
01:00:05,593 --> 01:00:06,761
- That's okay, I didn't 
make this one,

1528
01:00:06,761 --> 01:00:10,799
so that's okay, yeah (laughs).

1529
01:00:11,947 --> 01:00:14,950
- Good news, way more people
had no idea who the hell I was.

1530
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:17,786
(audience laughter)

1531
01:00:23,124 --> 01:00:24,135
It's a pretty good too.

1532
01:00:24,135 --> 01:00:24,936
- Yeah, so--

1533
01:00:24,936 --> 01:00:28,425
- So I remember
seven, ten years ago,

1534
01:00:28,425 --> 01:00:30,973
I was really passionate 
about Canadian wines,

1535
01:00:30,973 --> 01:00:34,043
Okanagan, here, to really
get them more into the U.S.

1536
01:00:34,043 --> 01:00:37,647
A lot wasn't coming in
and Jackson-Triggs really

1537
01:00:37,647 --> 01:00:40,316
caught my attention 
12, 13 years ago,

1538
01:00:40,316 --> 01:00:41,718
producing really 
high quality wines.

1539
01:00:41,718 --> 01:00:43,486
It's good to see
they're continuing that process.

1540
01:00:43,486 --> 01:00:46,255
Yeah, they've been a real
flagship winery in the region.

1541
01:00:46,255 --> 01:00:47,623
There's a few of us
that have been around

1542
01:00:47,623 --> 01:00:49,759
for that 20-plus years,
and it's nice because

1543
01:00:49,759 --> 01:00:51,901
we all carry that weight
together and Jackson-Triggs

1544
01:00:51,901 --> 01:00:54,237
being one of those big boys,
they produce a very consistent,

1545
01:00:54,237 --> 01:00:57,347
very well-rounded wine every
time, and you can just see

1546
01:00:57,347 --> 01:00:59,082
the bubble jumping
through this glass.

1547
01:00:59,082 --> 01:01:00,784
I know I'm talking
about all these wines,

1548
01:01:00,784 --> 01:01:02,285
we're drinking 'em now,
but we are gonna have 'em

1549
01:01:02,285 --> 01:01:04,121
for tasting outside with lunch.

1550
01:01:04,121 --> 01:01:04,785
- Oh, really?

1551
01:01:04,785 --> 01:01:06,855
- Yeah.
- Hey!

1552
01:01:06,855 --> 01:01:09,724
(audience applause)

1553
01:01:09,724 --> 01:01:12,193
- And as we move
forward, the very last wine

1554
01:01:12,193 --> 01:01:14,963
we're gonna pour,
coming from a family business

1555
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,831
at Pillitteri, my
grandmother and grandfather,

1556
01:01:16,831 --> 01:01:18,403
they're at the winery every day.

1557
01:01:18,403 --> 01:01:20,438
You talk about your
experience growing up

1558
01:01:20,438 --> 01:01:22,367
and in terms of
the wine industry,

1559
01:01:22,367 --> 01:01:24,069
it really is that
story and that connection

1560
01:01:24,069 --> 01:01:27,039
that people have that
makes them remember things.

1561
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:28,474
And the neat part
about coming to our winery

1562
01:01:28,474 --> 01:01:29,274
is that my grandmother

1563
01:01:29,274 --> 01:01:32,010
is the number one salesman
for this ice wine right here.

1564
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:33,712
- That's awesome.

1565
01:01:33,712 --> 01:01:35,781
- So 74 years old,
in there every day,

1566
01:01:35,781 --> 01:01:38,283
and she just loves explaining
to people about this ice wine

1567
01:01:38,283 --> 01:01:39,524
they've never heard of before,

1568
01:01:39,524 --> 01:01:41,484
because we get visitors
that come to Niagara Falls

1569
01:01:41,484 --> 01:01:43,036
showing up from
all over the world,

1570
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:45,154
and they are told
that you're gonna taste

1571
01:01:45,154 --> 01:01:46,656
the world's rarest wine.

1572
01:01:46,656 --> 01:01:47,924
And I know a lot
of people that say,

1573
01:01:47,924 --> 01:01:49,459
oh, this is special, 
this is unique.

1574
01:01:49,459 --> 01:01:52,428
Ice wine can only be made in
a very special small climate,

1575
01:01:52,428 --> 01:01:54,130
which we have here in Niagara.

1576
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:58,058
And ice wine is just
magically swirled in a glass.

1577
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:02,033
If there's any
aromas jumpin' out...

1578
01:02:02,033 --> 01:02:05,295
- I'm about to tell a story 
I haven't told in a long time.

1579
01:02:05,295 --> 01:02:08,864
When I was
single in New York City,

1580
01:02:08,864 --> 01:02:12,401
ice wine was a very big
part of my dating strategy.

1581
01:02:12,401 --> 01:02:15,604
(audience laughter)

1582
01:02:15,604 --> 01:02:17,406
'Cause it's so
delicious, you can drink

1583
01:02:17,406 --> 01:02:19,908
that whole little 
bottle in you know...

1584
01:02:19,908 --> 01:02:22,908
(audience laughter)

1585
01:02:27,539 --> 01:02:30,542
Who likes sugar,
raise your hands.

1586
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:31,743
This stuff is so good.

1587
01:02:31,743 --> 01:02:32,577
- Yeah.

1588
01:02:32,577 --> 01:02:35,213
- And when you compare
it to the great Sauternes

1589
01:02:35,213 --> 01:02:38,580
of the world that
tend to be four to 50 times

1590
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:43,123
more expensive, for
98% of the drinking public,

1591
01:02:43,123 --> 01:02:46,082
they're not gonna taste
the nuanced differences that

1592
01:02:46,082 --> 01:02:49,252
separate it, and that speaks
to the quality of these wines.

1593
01:02:49,252 --> 01:02:51,154
And what's really
crazy about these wines,

1594
01:02:51,154 --> 01:02:53,556
a lot of youngsters,
here's what I would say.

1595
01:02:53,556 --> 01:02:55,392
The thing I find most 
fascinating about these

1596
01:02:55,392 --> 01:02:59,930
ice wines is they will age
literally for 30, 40, 60 years.

1597
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,895
And they're
priced in a way that,

1598
01:03:02,895 --> 01:03:06,899
so a lot of my friends
who are now 40 years old

1599
01:03:06,899 --> 01:03:09,502
are super-thankful for me
because I pushed 'em on,

1600
01:03:09,502 --> 01:03:12,972
including yours, ice wine, 
which now they have,

1601
01:03:12,972 --> 01:03:14,874
they bought when they were 25.

1602
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:18,044
They're 15 years old, they're
really interesting wines.

1603
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,046
They're gonna last longer,
and I told 'em to buy a case

1604
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:23,349
and pour it at
their daughter's wedding

1605
01:03:23,349 --> 01:03:26,652
or their kid's wedding,
so I always think...

1606
01:03:26,652 --> 01:03:29,122
Back to living
your life, the moments,

1607
01:03:29,122 --> 01:03:32,364
me in the arcade, 
John, that stuff,

1608
01:03:32,364 --> 01:03:34,794
to me, that's what I loved 
about wine, which is

1609
01:03:34,794 --> 01:03:37,330
it's really cool, and there's
a lot of youngsters in here

1610
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:39,866
that you can go and buy six
bottles or something like this,

1611
01:03:39,866 --> 01:03:42,101
put it away somewhere 
that it can store,

1612
01:03:42,101 --> 01:03:44,103
and really open it
40 or 50 years later

1613
01:03:44,103 --> 01:03:45,738
and be like, that GaryVee guy

1614
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:47,940
who's like the
number one human on earth,

1615
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:51,411
he was the one who
told me to buy this.

1616
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:53,046
But it will last forever.

1617
01:03:53,046 --> 01:03:53,880
- Yeah.

1618
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,477
And it's really fun.

1619
01:03:55,477 --> 01:03:58,421
The Niagara wine industry
has so many different wines,

1620
01:03:58,421 --> 01:04:00,256
so many different styles, 
whether it's Baco Noir

1621
01:04:00,256 --> 01:04:02,692
or Cabernet Franc or ice
wine, but there's no question,

1622
01:04:02,692 --> 01:04:04,861
ice wine's what's kinda built
up our whole industry here.

1623
01:04:04,861 --> 01:04:06,059
When people think of Canada,

1624
01:04:06,059 --> 01:04:07,961
the first thing that pops
into their head is ice wine.

1625
01:04:07,961 --> 01:04:08,795
And we're very lucky.

1626
01:04:08,795 --> 01:04:11,097
Like I said, we ship this
to 35 different countries.

1627
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:13,689
It's crazy, if you see it
around the world sometimes.

1628
01:04:13,689 --> 01:04:15,658
Catches you off guard
if you're on vacation,

1629
01:04:15,658 --> 01:04:17,427
or you go to Las Vegas, 
and obviously things

1630
01:04:17,427 --> 01:04:18,552
are more expensive 
in Las Vegas,

1631
01:04:18,552 --> 01:04:20,974
but you see the bottle, 
which is $50, $60 here--

1632
01:04:20,974 --> 01:04:23,810
- Las Vegas is another
good place to bring ice wine.

1633
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:24,744
- Yeah.

1634
01:04:24,744 --> 01:04:27,013
(audience laughter)

1635
01:04:27,013 --> 01:04:27,847
- Thank you.

1636
01:04:27,847 --> 01:04:28,681
- It's more expensive right--

1637
01:04:28,681 --> 01:04:30,335
- Congratulations.
- Thanks so much for everything.

1638
01:04:30,335 --> 01:04:31,169
- Yeah, thank you for
letting me taste this.

1639
01:04:31,169 --> 01:04:32,103
- It's just fun
to taste some wines.

1640
01:04:32,103 --> 01:04:32,691
- Ton.

1641
01:04:32,691 --> 01:04:33,858
- Glad you've heard of
Niagara and Pillitteri.

1642
01:04:33,858 --> 01:04:35,156
- Oh, of course.
Know it super well.

1643
01:04:35,156 --> 01:04:36,539
Thank you.

1644
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,800
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1645
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,813
(audience applause)

1646
01:04:45,984 --> 01:04:48,553
- Richard Slingerland, 
Pillitteri Estates.

1647
01:04:48,553 --> 01:04:49,888
Thank you so much.

1648
01:04:49,888 --> 01:04:52,490
We have one more guest up here
to see you for a quick sec

1649
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:55,393
first before I do that I have
a bit of housekeeping here,

1650
01:04:55,393 --> 01:04:56,427
just one quick thing.

1651
01:04:56,427 --> 01:05:01,118
There is a red Ford F-150

1652
01:05:01,118 --> 01:05:05,432
it's license plate 
is AK48326.

1653
01:05:05,432 --> 01:05:07,200
- This is not real.
- No, it's real.

1654
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:11,304
It's parked illegally and
it's going to be towed but

1655
01:05:11,304 --> 01:05:13,673
I think that this
happened an hour a go so,

1656
01:05:13,673 --> 01:05:15,174
(audience laughter)

1657
01:05:15,174 --> 01:05:18,244
you might be running
after your car so once again,

1658
01:05:18,244 --> 01:05:22,023
Ford F-150 AK48326.

1659
01:05:22,023 --> 01:05:23,763
- This is the best
conference I've ever been to.

1660
01:05:23,763 --> 01:05:26,645
- Can you imagine?
(audience applause)

1661
01:05:26,645 --> 01:05:28,033
Okay my next order of business,

1662
01:05:28,033 --> 01:05:30,686
if people could please
take out their bingo cards,

1663
01:05:30,686 --> 01:05:32,037
I'm totally kidding.

1664
01:05:32,037 --> 01:05:33,698
(audience laughter)
No, I was just joking.

1665
01:05:33,698 --> 01:05:36,708
Alright, I want to bring another
guest out he's got a gift

1666

Five time Gray Cup Champion.

1670
01:05:44,371 --> 01:05:45,372
- Wow.

1671
01:05:45,372 --> 01:05:48,309
- He's also of course because
of those accolades a member

1672
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:51,111
of the Canadian
Football Hall of Fame.

1673
01:05:51,111 --> 01:05:53,614
He's the athletic director
right now at Brock University.

1674
01:05:53,614 --> 01:05:55,449
(audience cheers)

1675
01:05:55,449 --> 01:05:57,518
There he goes, coach.

1676
01:05:57,518 --> 01:05:59,953
He was with his daughter
Kristen on amazing race and his

1677
01:05:59,953 --> 01:06:03,913
son Jesse Lumsden after a
successful yet short career in

01:06:07,037 --> 01:06:09,883
for his second Olympic game.

1680
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:12,019
This is NeIl Lumsden.

1681
01:06:12,019 --> 01:06:14,855
(audience applause and cheers)

1682
01:06:19,981 --> 01:06:22,126
- Is this on,
can everyone hear me?

1683
01:06:22,126 --> 01:06:23,528
Just so security knows,

1684
01:06:23,528 --> 01:06:26,457
that's my truck,
don't touch my truck,

1685
01:06:26,457 --> 01:06:28,025
whoever it is.

1686
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:29,215
- How are you?
- Great to meet you.

1687
01:06:29,215 --> 01:06:30,259
- Such a pleasure.
- A great day, it's my pleasure.

1688
01:06:30,259 --> 01:06:32,604
- Jesus, some 
serious guns under here.

1689
01:06:32,604 --> 01:06:36,291
(audience laughter)
- Yeah well curls get girls.

1690
01:06:36,291 --> 01:06:40,729
Listen, I was asked to and
clearly it doesn't work for

1691
01:06:40,729 --> 01:06:43,165
those that are paying attention.

1692
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:45,567
I'm today's bag man
but more importantly,

1693
01:06:45,567 --> 01:06:48,821
thank you for a lot of things
you talked about and a lot

1694
01:06:48,821 --> 01:06:50,690
of things you said they
resonated not only with me but

1695
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:51,461
with everyone else.

1696
01:06:51,461 --> 01:06:54,873
It also reminds me
how lucky I've been,

1697
01:06:54,873 --> 01:06:57,901
and it all resonated but one
of the things that really

1698
01:06:57,901 --> 01:07:00,379
resonated when you
talked about a firefighter

1699
01:07:00,379 --> 01:07:02,781
and firefighters 
and that attitude.

1700
01:07:02,781 --> 01:07:06,551
I've had the good fortune
from university to whatever

1701
01:07:06,551 --> 01:07:09,069
time it is right now to be 
around people that

1702
01:07:09,069 --> 01:07:11,880
always ran in, 
didn't run out.

1703
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,348
And that's one of the reasons
I think I've had a lot of

1704
01:07:13,348 --> 01:07:16,485
fun in life so
thanks for reminding me.

1705
01:07:16,485 --> 01:07:18,230
But more importantly 
on a football front,--

1706
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:20,544
- Yes.
- the Super Bowl is over,--

1707
01:07:20,544 --> 01:07:21,746
- Yes, thank God.

1708
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,368
(audience laughter)

1709
01:07:23,368 --> 01:07:25,483
- But our national championship,
the Grey Cup Game, was played

1710
01:07:25,483 --> 01:07:28,689
in November and I was
involved in a few of them,

1711
01:07:28,689 --> 01:07:31,259
all successful I'm pleased 
to say and as you probably

1712
01:07:31,259 --> 01:07:34,695
know for national championships 
they make so many

1713
01:07:34,695 --> 01:07:37,055
footballs that are
branded for the Grey Cup.

1714
01:07:37,055 --> 01:07:37,664
- Yes.

1715
01:07:37,664 --> 01:07:40,688
- So I thought it's
appropriate that given you're a

1716
01:07:40,688 --> 01:07:44,187
football fan that we would
get you one of the few branded

1717
01:07:44,187 --> 01:07:47,424
balls from this year's Grey Cup 
signed by our commissioner,

1718
01:07:47,424 --> 01:07:49,930
and I threw my
signature on there as well.

1719
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:52,017
- I appreciate it.
(audience laughter and applause)

1720
01:07:58,036 --> 01:08:01,200
- And Pedro if you come
up and do a couple of flips,

1721
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,102
you don't get one either.

1722
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,484
Not impressive enough, buddy,

1723
01:08:05,484 --> 01:08:07,450
not impressive enough.
- He was ready though.

1724
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:08,985
I like that speed, Pedro.

1725
01:08:08,985 --> 01:08:10,305
- But you're right
it's not good enough.

1726
01:08:10,305 --> 01:08:11,172
- Well, thank you.

1727
01:08:11,172 --> 01:08:13,940
- So on behalf of myself, 
Brock University, athletes,

1728
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:15,881
thank you.
- That's a real honor,

1729
01:08:15,881 --> 01:08:16,881
thank you very much.

1730
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:18,187
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

1731
01:08:18,187 --> 01:08:19,350
(audience applause)

1732
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:20,350
- [Man] That's awesome.

1733
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:22,164
- Thanks a lot.

1734
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:24,250
- [Man] Thanks a 
lot Neil, fantastic.

1735
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:26,185
Gary, thank you
very much for your time.

1736
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:27,186
- Thank you do I have to go?

1737
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:29,033
- You are ready
to go if you need to.

1738
01:08:29,033 --> 01:08:30,368
- But I'll take
three selfies, let's go.

1739
01:08:30,368 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
