1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,708
- On this episode, these
two YouTube legends stop by.

2
00:00:04,708 --> 00:00:08,625
(hip hop music)

3
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,458
- [Gary] You ask questions,

4
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:22,417
and I answer them.

5
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:27,333
This is The #AskGaryVee Show.

6
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,667
Hey everybody,
this is Gary Vay-ner-chuk,

7
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:34,500
and it's episode 247

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,375
of The #AskGaryVee Show.

9
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,417
First of all, what
do you got, Instagram?

10
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:42,041
That's Facebook live?
- [Dunk] Instagram Live.

11
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,208
- You're Facebook live? 
And Facebook live is where

12
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,583
we're taking the
phone numbers from?

13
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,792
All right, Facebook live,
put your phone numbers down,

14
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:49,750
I'm gonna introduce
my guests in a second,

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,875
but your phone numbers in

16
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,500
and we're gonna
call you in a little bit.

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,125
We are on a roll with guests
on The #AskGaryVee Show,

18
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,625
last couple have been
really substantially awesome,

19
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,500
and this one, I think,

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,125
has the potential
to top it even more.

21
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:05,041
I've a cut in half
wrestling belt that,

22
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,458
if you watch DailyVee,
you know what that's about,

23
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,375
but for the ones that don't

24
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:10,875
or didn't
serendipitously catch that,

25
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm gonna allow
these two tremendously

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,875
handsome individuals
introduce themselves,

27
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,875
so let's start with the better
looking one first, my man?

28
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,667
Why don't you tell the
Vayner Nation who you are.

29
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:24,750
- I am Lincoln
from What's Inside,

30
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,583
our channel is that
we cut stuff open, so.

31
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:28,500
- That's what you do?

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,417
- Yeah, that's
why we have there.

33
00:01:30,417 --> 00:01:32,208
- And Lincoln, how old are
you and where are you from?

34
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,625
- I'm 11, and I'm
from Kingsville, Utah.

35
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:37,208
- So, you were born in 2006?

36
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:38,000
- Yes.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,917
- (laughs) I know,
seriously, right?

38
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:41,834
- Bro, that hurts.
- Yeah.

39
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:42,708
- And you, my man?

40
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,417
- So, I'm Dan,
I am Lincoln's dad,

41
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:46,708
and we started this channel

42
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,250
off of his second
grade science project,

43
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,583
and all of a sudden it
turned into a YouTube channel

44
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,166
where we now have
four million subscribers.

45
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,708
I used to sell drugs,
like Viagra and Lipitor

46
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:57,250
and those things, and
now I'm a YouTuber full time,

47
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,959
as of July of this last year,

48
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,208
so kinda crazy the way
the digital world works.

49
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,166
- And I heard this story,

50
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,500
and I don't
think it made our vlog,

51
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,542
but the second grade project,

52
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,583
let's spend a second
on that because I think

53
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,375
it's important for
everybody to realize

54
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,750
what the seed of
things that can happen.

55
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,750
So many of you
are sitting at home

56
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,792
and saying I'm gonna
become an influencer,

57
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:16,500
I'm gonna become a YouTuber,

58
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,542
and you're
manipulating it in your head,

59
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:21,208
and you're trying to force
something instead of listening,

60
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,417
you're talking, right?

61
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:25,333
You're trying to manifest it
instead of paying attention to,

62
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,000
and reacting to something.

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,750
Yours was a reaction, you
became a full time YouTuber

64
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,542
by reacting to
something that happened,

65
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:32,542
let's tell that story,

66
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:33,917
because I think
it can be a framework

67
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:35,667
for so many of
you that can help you

68
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:38,000
get to what you want in reverse.

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,708
- Right, so, yeah, I mean we'd
had like 80 different videos

70
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,959
on YouTube that are family
videos and different things,

71
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:45,125
and I'd kind of
looked at the algorithm

72
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,291
and saw maybe we
should optimize these,

73
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,333
and you can make money
off of YouTube and stuff.

74
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,667
- How did you even
stumble in that thought,

75
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:52,875
did you read an article?

76
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:53,875
- So, way back in the day,

77
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:57,041
just reading articles and
seeing the Google Adsense,

78
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,708
I had a website
of a failed company

79
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,125
that I did way back in
the day that was like secret,

80
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,208
that people didn't know about,

81
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,333
some people
still don't know about.

82
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,792
We spent like $25,000
on this company, failed,

83
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:07,250
and I learned
about Google Adsense

84
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,625
with that website that we had,

85
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,959
and then once we
got onto YouTube,

86
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,333
I'm like oh, ads
can run on there.

87
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,166
- They have it here too.

88
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,000
- Yeah, and so he had a science
project, and at the time,

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,125
there was an article that
said that the number one place

90
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,458
that people look for
questions is on YouTube,

91
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,417
not Google.com but on YouTube,

92
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:23,542
and so his science project

93
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:25,667
was ask a
science related question,

94
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:27,041
and then you
answer it in your project.

95
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,667
So, his was Dad,
what's inside of sports balls?

96
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:33,041
So, we cut open the
five different sports balls,

97
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,291
I set my phone up
on the kitchen counter,

98
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,125
Lincoln was totally
sick during those videos.

99
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:41,083
- Yeah, like I was like a
zombie, I looked like a zombie.

100
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,708
- But we put
'em up there as like

101
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,667
we put 'em individual videos,
like what's inside a baseball?

102
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:46,166
- What? You were green?

103
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:49,750
- Not that much of a zombie.

104
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,125
- Got it, got it. Got it.

105
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,875
- And so we put
those on YouTube,

106
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,000
and we just like a year later,

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,583
we made four dollars
in one day off of Adsense.

108
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,542
- That's when you decided
to retire and go full time.

109
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:03,375
- That's it, full time, there
we go, quit the day job.

110
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:06,250
Yeah, so that was
December of 2014, and bam,

111
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,625
four dollars in one day.

112
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,041
So, I'm like Lincoln, I
think we got something here.

113
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,250
By the time you're 18 years old,

114
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,959
you might have a little
bit of money for college,

115
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,875
so let's just keep
cutting stuff open,

116
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,500
we'll keep doing it in
different worlds of YouTube.

117
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,416
And so, any time
somebody's watching a video,

118
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,625
the suggested will
hopefully be our video.

119
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:23,166
- So, we just cut open
some more sports balls,

120
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,500
and we published like
five videos in one day,

121
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,583
and we lost half
of our 40 subscribers.

122
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,208
- You went from 40 to 20?

123
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,041
- Exactly.

124
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,208
- You said okay, no more
posting five things a day.

125
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,542
- Yes, time to learn about like

126
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:35,041
what the
algorithm actually does.

127
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,875
So, January 2015, started fresh,

128
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,625
April of 2015 we
hit 1,000 subscribers,

129
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,166
we went out for ice cream,
we were super stoked.

130
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,333
- What flavor did you get?

131
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,166
- Oreo and vanilla.

132
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,208
- And you?

133
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,917
- I just got a
mixture of like cake batter

134
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:52,375
and yummy stuff, yeah.

135
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,458
- DRock, what's
your favorite ice cream?

136
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,834
- [DRock] Cookie dough.

137
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:58,834
- Andy?
- Good choice.

138
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:01,083
- Cookie dough's pretty
good, I vote cookie dough.

139
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:04,792
- [Gary] Cookie dough? Yeah,
I get it, I get it. Dunk?

140
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:06,417
- [Dunk] For
Ben &amp; Jerry, it's...

141
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:08,583
- No, not Ben &amp; Jerry, I
know that you've gone there,

142
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,000
globally, your
favorite ice cream flavor.

143
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,041
- [Dunk] Chocolate
fudge brownie.

144
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:14,875
- Just?

145
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,291
- [Justin] Cookies
and cream, for sure.

146
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,375
- Yeah, there we go.

147
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,708
- Cookies and cream?
Cookies and cream?

148
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,333
- [Man] Vanilla fudge.
- Gary?

149
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,917
- I mean, none of my
top three even made it,

150
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:31,083
coffee, mint chocolate chip,
and strawberry.

151
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,542
- Okay, that's good, nice.

152
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,708
- All right, good.

153
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,959
- I love strawberry.
- The fruit?

154
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,125
- No, for smoothies.

155
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,417
- Smoothies, okay, got it.

156
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:43,208
So, you made
1,000 bucks, now what?

157
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,834
- Well, we hit 1,000
subscribers in April,

158
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:49,083
and then by August
we hit 100,000, crazy.

159
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,625
- So, what was
the first viral video?

160
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:51,583
- So, the first viral video,

161
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,750
I would say would be the
bowling ball video that we had,

162
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,333
what's inside of a bowling ball,

163
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,417
and it's the first time I had
ever used a chop saw before,

164
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:58,875
and that was kind of the draw.

165
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,208
- If you go back
and watch that video,

166
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:04,750
he has a big ply
two by four stick

167
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,083
poking the bowling
ball trying to cut it open.

168
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,792
- It was bad.

169
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:12,625
- You guys have become much
better at cutting things open.

170
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,166
- Kind of.
(group laughter)

171
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,250
- A little bit better.

172
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,375
So yeah, a year later we
hit a million subscribers.

173
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,208
So December 2015--

174
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,500
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

175
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,000
- Yes?
- Is today Wednesday?

176
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,333
- [DRock] Yes.

177
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:24,875
- Is it?

178
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,083
- So, he just misses school?

179
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,375
- He misses school today, yep.

180
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,417
But that's the thing.

181
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:30,000
We told him he's
learning from you.

182
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,917
Like, what?
- Yeah!

183
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:31,625
- You don't
learn this in school.

184
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,959
You don't get to be with the
king of digital advertising.

185
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,750
- No, no.
Just so you know.

186
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,166
Just so you know,
I didn't do that for a laugh.

187
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,250
I did that to
remind everybody how much

188
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,875
I actually believe
in what you're doing.

189
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:44,583
I promise you, this man
has no prayer of remembering

190
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,375
what the curriculum was
in his school on today's day,

191
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,417
but he will always
remember meeting DRock.

192
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:51,708
- That's right.
- For a second time!

193
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,000
(group laughter)

194
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,166
All right,
let's keep this going.

195
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,875
So, boom, 100,000.

196
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:59,000
Now you clearly didn't
say this to me the other day,

197
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,542
and now I'm putting
the pieces together.

198
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:02,708
You have been
historically fascinated by

199
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,834
this ad arbitrage,
this AdSense thing.

200
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:07,875
I, listen, I will
tell you that me and AJ

201
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,208
early on were
fascinated by Google Adwords

202
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,333
and AdSense and the arbitrage.

203
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:16,750
So you naturally went into
understanding distribution.

204
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,458
Right? You figured out
what your creative was,

205
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,917
which is, which is
by the way brilliant.

206
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:23,208
Because you never,
in your lifetime,

207
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,083
and you're a young dude,

208
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,708
will ever be able to cut
open every item on Earth.

209
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,333
Which is why Wine Library TV
was very successful.

210
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,000
And this is the
lesson for everybody.

211
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,375
When you create something,

212
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,417
try to create something

213
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:35,041
that you'll never
achieve doing all of it.

214
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:38,000
Too many people start channels
or concepts or creatives

215
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,708
that after four
videos, it's over.

216
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,083
Because you
can't do anything else.

217
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,458
Wine Library TV was amazing

218
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,166
because I could
never taste every wine.

219
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,542
- Makes sense.
- Forever.

220
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:47,041
You have no
chance of ever cutting.

221
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,375
So once you've got
your creative down,

222
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:52,000
you really got super
smart around distribution.

223
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,625
As a matter of fact,
as everybody knows,

224
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,834
I asked you,
once I picked up on that,

225
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:57,166
I emailed you a
couple days ago and said,

226
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,625
hey, can you
stay for an extra hour

227
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,625
and talk to Andy and the team?

228
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,083
Love to pick up on
some of your nuances.

229
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,625
And we know what we're doing,

230
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,500
but YouTube has never
been historically the place

231
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
I went quadruple deep down on.

232
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,792
And so you really became not
only this creative powerhouse

233
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:12,500
but you've become quite strong

234
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,750
at the distribution of
content within the ecosystem.

235
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,375
- Yeah, I think most of
it is we're not living--

236
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,542
- Are you proud
of your dad for that?

237
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:18,375
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

238
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,667
- We're not the best actors

239
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:20,500
if you're going
to put it that way.

240
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,667
Like, a lot of times, we
don't even know what's going

241
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:23,792
to be inside of
something before we cut it open.

242
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:24,542
Because--

243
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:26,041
- Sometimes, I don't even
know what we're cutting open.

244
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,125
He just surprises me sometimes.

245
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,083
And I have no idea.

246
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,875
- Let's not downplay
what kind of star this guy is.

247
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:31,750
- Yeah. No, he's good.

248
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,166
He's good.
- You?

249
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,500
- No, I'm not
that great on an actor.

250
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,332
But I feel like we
understand the algorithm.

251
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:39,041
I have a finance background,
and that's what I did.

252
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,500
I'm like, I'm gonna
go and figure out

253
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,957
every little thing about
the algorithm that I can.

254
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:43,874
So that I can understand it.

255
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,041
- And it's a
moving target, right?

256
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,250
- It does.
It changes all the time.

257
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,208
- Right. Do you get
excited when it changes,

258
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,250
because you can find new things?

259
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,083
- Yeah, it's--

260
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,750
- Or, are you at
this big place now,

261
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,125
where you're like
do not change that much

262
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:53,917
because I've got it figured out?

263
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:55,625
- I mean, we do have it,
a lot of things figured out.

264
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,208
But as soon as
something does change,

265
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,208
we're pretty quick to
figure out what happened.

266
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,208
- And have you
brought him to that part?

267
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,583
Or is that kind of like it gets,

268
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,834
I mean, that's
kind of nerdy stuff.

269
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,166
- So, a lot of it is like,

270
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,917
I don't want
Lincoln to feel like

271
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:07,250
he's this kid that has a job.

272
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,208
Like, a full time job.

273
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,625
So, he comes and
does the fun stuff.

274
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,000
It is a lot of work.

275
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,708
- Yeah.

276
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,083
- But there are
some things that he --

277
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,000
- Yeah. I do have fun
with some of the ideas.

278
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,959
- Yeah, like creation.

279
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,041
Or when we're
working with a brand,

280
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,000
we'll come to
Lincoln and be like.

281
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,875
Sometimes I've
pitched something.

282
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,000
One of our first big possible
brand deals that we had,

283
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,583
a company came to us and
wanted to give us $50,000

284
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,208
and I was like, oh my
gosh, this is so much money.

285
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,625
I said, Lincoln,
all we have to do

286
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:28,750
is cut open this product.

287
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,750
And we can't say what it is.

288
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,208
So we didn't end up doing it.

289
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,333
I was like, this is so much
money, let's do it, Lincoln.

290
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,208
- Lincoln said no?

291
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,583
- He says, Dad,
we'll be selling out.

292
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,750
We can't do that product.

293
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,000
So what did we do that week?

294
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,125
- Lincoln, what gave
you the internal strength

295
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,667
to turn down so much money?

296
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,333
- I just didn't feel like

297
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,834
it was the right thing to do.

298
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:49,417
Because we kept on filming
things that are not brand deals.

299
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:51,000
'Cause we just
wanted to build it up, too.

300
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,834
- Yep. You thought Dad
was trying to cash out

301
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:53,959
a hair too early?

302
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,333
- Mhmmm.
- Very good.

303
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,750
- [Dan] Yeah. And the funny
thing is, this is a true story.

304
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,625
That week is the week
that we published a video

305
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,041
that I didn't like at all.

306
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,333
It was the what's
inside a rattlesnake rattle?

307
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,250
That video got 42
million views in a week.

308
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,041
And was the number
three most trending video

309
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,166
viral video of all
of 2016 on YouTube.

310
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,583
And that was the
week when I wanted to do

311
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,542
the $50,000 brand
deal that would have been

312
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:14,875
the sellout that Lincoln's like,

313
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,250
"No Dad, we can't do this."

314
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,375
- So Lincoln, do you take full
credit for all the success?

315
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,375
- Ahh, not really.

316
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,375
- What percentage
of the success is you,

317
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,750
and what percentage is Dad?

318
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,208
Just in your opinion,
one man's point of view?

319
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:31,208
- I think that 25% is me.

320
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:34,041
And, yeah.

321
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,792
- What a great kid, huh?
- He's the face, man.

322
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:36,792
People love Lincoln.
(laughter)

323
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:37,417
- Lincoln, Lincoln.

324
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:39,291
What we know, and what
everybody who's watching knows,

325
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,792
is that that for kids

326
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:46,834
age five and a half to eighteen

327
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:48,625
and beyond

328
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,000
YouTube is such an
incredibly important place.

329
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,083
You are the face

330
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,166
or one of the two faces

331
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,583
of a channel that has
four million subscribers.

332
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,417
Do your classmates
think you're famous?

333
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:01,917
- They don't think much of it.

334
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:04,875
But sometimes we just
watch the videos in class.

335
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,625
Like last year, we
watched a couple of them.

336
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,166
'Cause that's like around
subject that we're working on.

337
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,583
But really it's not that much

338
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,834
'cause, like, people at
school, like at recess,

339
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:15,125
they say, I love your video.
Let's go play football,

340
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,250
let's go play basketball, let's
go--

341
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,333
- They don't make
a big deal about it.

342
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,792
- Yeah.
- Cause you keep it chill.

343
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:19,458
- Yeah.

344
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,000
- Okay, but how 'bout when
you guys go to ice cream now?

345
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,417
I have to assume sometimes
people roll up on you and say,

346
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,667
whoa, I love your videos!

347
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:27,333
- Yeah.

348
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,750
- And people want to
take selfies with you.

349
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,250
- Yeah, that's cool.
- You love that.

350
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,542
- Yeah.
- I agree.

351
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:33,083
- I love that.
(group laughter)

352
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,208
- I agree.

353
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:38,041
Okay so, so,
what's the punchline now?

354
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,834
Like, this is insanity.

355
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:40,375
- It's a good question.

356
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,041
Like we, after
watching some of your videos,

357
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,083
we want to try to grow in
some of our other platforms.

358
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,708
YouTube, I feel
like we're crushing it

359
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:46,917
and we're having a blast.

360
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:48,834
But maybe on Instagram.

361
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,583
Lincoln's favorite
platform right now,

362
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,083
not favorite platform
but favorite thing to do

363
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,834
is to go live on
Instagram right now.

364
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:56,375
- I just love connecting
with fans in Instagram live.

365
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,208
I don't know why,
but I just love it.

366
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,333
- 'Cause it's addicting.

367
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,166
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

368
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,291
- Yeah, you just have
conversation with them.

369
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,458
So we're
learning that side of it.

370
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,792
We're building a brand.

371
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:06,417
We've, we've worked with
more brands this year already

372
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:08,417
than we worked with
our entire history so far.

373
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:11,000
So, luckily, like we
had some good mentors

374
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,417
like Shonduras with Snapchat.

375
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:14,208
He took us under
his wing and was like,

376
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,375
hey, help me grow
my YouTube channel

377
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:20,166
I'll teach you how to not
stop making TV commercials

378
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,083
in your YouTube
videos, but actually make

379
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,417
authentic integrations that make

380
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:24,542
the brand look like the all-star

381
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:26,000
and makes great
content for your fans.

382
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,208
So, so, yeah.

383
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,333
We're still
learning and evolving.

384
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,667
It's just like,
just us right now.

385
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:31,834
We haven't even hired
a full time employee yet.

386
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,458
- Let's go to the phone.
But that's coming.

387
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,834
- Soon. In the
next couple weeks,

388
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,458
we've got two
people coming on board.

389
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,375
- Two full?
- Two full time employees.

390
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,375
- How many people applied?

391
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,458
- A lot.
(laughter)

392
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,834
A lot of people.

393
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:43,542
Yeah.
- Mhmmm.

394
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:45,500
- In person,
weeded out a lot of people.

395
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,875
- One of the
things I keep telling you

396
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,708
is to document and not create.

397
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,583
When you document,
or you just do,

398
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,000
serendipity happens and
then you can react to it.

399
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,250
And that's the story of this.
- [Brian] Hello?

400
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,750
- Hey, this is GaryVee

401
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,375
and you're on
The #AskGaryVee Show.

402
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,125
- [Brian] That's fucking sick!

403
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,291
- (laughter) Yes it is.

404
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,166
- [Brian] Awesome!

405
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,208
- What's your name?

406
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,625
- [Brian] My name
is Brian Pickowitz.

407
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,291
- Hey, Brian.
So what's your question?

408
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,625
- [Brian] So right now I own an

409
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,375
online personal
training company,

410
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,834
where I do online coaching.

411
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:18,333
And I have a really
successful platform that I'm

412
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,458
operating on
Facebook and Instagram,

413
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,250
but I'm having a
really difficult time

414
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,792
getting more
viewership and subscriptions

415
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:29,083
through my YouTube channel.

416
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,542
So I don't think
it's as much of a problem

417
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:31,500
with the content,

418
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,959
although the content
could certainly be better.

419
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,792
But I guess 
I really don't understand,

420
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:38,000
is there something else
I could be putting into it,

421
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
that would help
really drive more content

422
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,667
to my YouTube channel?

423
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:45,667
- Good question,

424
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:46,542
really good question.

425
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:49,333
How much time are you
putting into your titles

426
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,375
and your descriptions?

427
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,583
And from that side of the thing,

428
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,333
are you paying much
attention to the tags

429
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,834
and titles of
descriptions that you put in?

430
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,750
- [Brian] I am paying
more attention now to the tags,

431
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,500
as I've gotten more into it.

432
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,333
I try not to
clickbait people too much,

433
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,375
but at the same time,

434
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:07,583
that is a big part of
getting attention organically.

435
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:11,792
I kind of base off
of doing a Monday rant,

436
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:13,500
like a Monday motivational rant,

437
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,041
and then I do vlogs
throughout the week.

438
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:19,917
So I'm trying to
build a brand around that.

439
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:24,834
I'm trying to attach
it to different fitness

440
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:26,417
entrepreneurs and
things of the like,

441
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,250
but I guess I don't understand

442
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,333
more of how that works.

443
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,083
- Before we get
into the smart questions,

444
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,041
let me ask you a macro question.

445
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:36,208
What are you trying to achieve?

446
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,250
- [Brian] So, right now

447
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,500
I honestly deleted
you for a while,

448
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,208
which is awesome.

449
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,458
I kind of added you again,

450
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,959
based off of just
trying to get more focus on it.

451
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,000
For me, I have personal goals--

452
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,750
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

453
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,500
You deleted me
because of my rants of like,

454
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,041
stop listening to me and go do?

455
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,208
- [Brian] Yes.
- Or you deleted me,

456
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:59,542
Okay, that reason, right?
- [Brian] Yes.

457
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:01,208
But what I
started tapping into again

458
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,083
was just trying to
get more direction.

459
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,875
But to answer your question,

460
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,500
I am a budding
competitive bodybuilder,

461
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,125
so I'm working my way on that.

462
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,125
And I'm building
this coaching business

463
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,291
as I grow.

464
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,959
So my goal is,
as I grow,

465
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:15,792
my personal brand grows,

466
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:18,166
and this coaching grows with it.

467
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,542
So I want to attach different--

468
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:23,000
(crosstalk)

469
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,917
Yeah.
What are you coaching?

470
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:29,917
And what does it cost,

471
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:31,583
and what does it do?

472
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,750
- [Brian] Well, what I offer is,

473
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,333
essentially, lifestyle coaching.

474
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,917
I am a competitive bodybuilder,

475
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:39,166
but I don't look at what I do as

476
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,875
a way of offering
people bodybuilding,

477
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,458
because that's
not what I wanna do.

478
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,875
I want to teach
people how to diet healthy,

479
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,250
understand how to diet--

480
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,750
- And how much does that cost?

481
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,834
- [Brian] It depends on the
package that they buy.

482
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:56,458
Some of my 
packages range up into...

483
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,875
I have a year-long package

484
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,792
that's about $3000.

485
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,333
And it kind of
goes down from there.

486
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:07,333
The actual product
is very in-depth, I guess,

487
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,083
as far as what I'm
offering my clients,

488
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,417
because the way
that I look at it is,

489
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm not just giving
you a product of value,

490
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,834
based on this and that.

491
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:16,667
I'm someone
who's in your corner,

492
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,125
so I try to
actually build a team

493
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,291
based off me and my
client that makes it so

494
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,375
that they know that.

495
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,750
I think the
hardest thing about fitness

496
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,208
and getting in
shape and stuff like that,

497
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,166
is most people
feel like they're alone.

498
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:31,000
- And do you do
that in actuality?

499
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,041
In phone calls and video?

500
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,917
Or is that
through content email?

501
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:37,792
- [Brian] It is
through phone calls.

502
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:40,041
- How often?

503
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,542
- [Brian] Biweekly and then they

504
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,166
have weekly report cards
that they have to fill out.

505
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:48,041
The business is actually very
successful at this point.

506
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:51,041
I've worked with over 200
clients in two years.

507
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,875
And the hard 
part right now, I guess, is

508
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,375
I'm trying to kind of transition

509
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,834
into more of growing my brand,

510
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:01,000
rather than just
growing based off clients.

511
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,917
If that makes sense.
- Of course.

512
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:04,834
- [Brian] My
YouTube channel is where

513
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:06,333
I'm trying to put
more of my energy,

514
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:10,500
so I can attach
because not everyone can afford

515
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,708
an expensive
online coaching package.

516
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,540
So I want to branch
into smaller products

517
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,749
that make it so
I can grow this message

518
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,083
a lot more vastly, I guess.

519
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,708
- Have you
factored in that you're

520
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,500
one of 8 million people that are

521
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,917
trying to do the
same exact blueprint?

522
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,500
- [Brian] Yes.
- Okay.

523
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,917
So let's go back to
the YouTube channel,

524
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,917
because I'm done
with my macro work.

525
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:36,792
- He said clickbaiting.

526
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:39,417
I think he put a negative
connotation on something

527
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:42,166
that you've used to
create an enormous opportunity.

528
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,458
- Yeah, I don't consider it
clickbait if it's something

529
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,500
that's within your video,

530
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,333
like for example our
rattlesnake rattle video,

531
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,417
the one part where
you see the thumbnail,

532
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:51,959
it's a black background

533
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:53,959
and then we have
the rattle on top of it.

534
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:55,291
That was planned out,

535
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,667
I was going to
use a cutting board.

536
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:57,542
I wasn't going
to cut it on there,

537
00:17:57,542 --> 00:18:00,333
but we purposely, in the video
went, oh this is too hard,

538
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,959
let's get a cutting board,
but it was just for that shot,

539
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:04,208
just for the thumbnail,
it was thought out.

540
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,875
So, that's in the thumbnail

541
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:06,875
and then the
title is like what's

542
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:07,875
inside a rattlesnake rattle.

543
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,500
We have a family channel where
we will do clickbaity stuff,

544
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,583
but if it's in the
video that's what it's about

545
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:14,375
and that's going to be...
- No, no, no, no, no,

546
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,959
let's just
establish this right now.

547
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:19,208
Here's clickbait,
naked boobs inside

548
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,625
and it's a football video.

549
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,083
Watch this video,
win a $1,000,000

550
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,959
and it's an ice cream video.

551
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:27,458
It's not being smart.

552
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,959
We are terrible at
our YouTube titling.

553
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:33,750
Me and DRock debate over a text

554
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,834
and I'm like, uh,
uh, rumbling in Arizona.

555
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:41,291
We do nothing smart
about our image thumbnail

556
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,000
and our title,

557
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,750
which is why I'm just
winning on the actual content,

558
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,500
not on all the smart things

559
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,458
and I know that because
where I do the smart things,

560
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:54,208
I win and I win twice,
10, 15 times better

561
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,959
than when I
actually know the de...

562
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:58,041
What I'm doing on YouTube,
which is my whole career,

563
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,041
has been
lollygagging on YouTube,

564
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,542
including leaving YouTube

565
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:03,375
when I was one of
the first YouTube stars

566
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,375
and going to Viddler.

567
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,792
So, it's this funny
relationship I have with it,

568
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:08,959
but I want to
make sure you, Brian

569
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:11,834
and everybody knows
that clickbaiting is

570
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:14,500
when you fully
trick somebody into it.

571
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,333
- For sure.

572
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,000
- Not you describe it properly

573
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,333
and make it
enticing to watch it.

574
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,917
Clickbaiting is putting, again,

575
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:23,750
an attractive
individual on the image

576
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,708
and when you click into it,

577
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:25,375
it had nothing to do with it

578
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,875
and that one
second they flashed that,

579
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:27,708
so they could show that.

580
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,542
- Exactly.

581
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,625
- Not strategically
thinking about

582
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,917
what you're going
to make in the video

583
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:33,667
and then doing
that for that purpose

584
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:37,250
that's called being smart.
- Yep.

585
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,667
And, and a lot...

586
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:39,667
- [Brian] Absolutely,
absolutely.

587
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:41,291
- Listen man,
I'll tell you this,

588
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,625
I answered your
question just so you know.

589
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,166
Which is everybody's
trying to do what you're doing.

590
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,667
People want to sell
courses then they realize that,

591
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,500
that doesn't only scale so much

592
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,917
so then what they decide is

593
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:53,500
let me get even more famous

594
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,083
so I can sell
t-shirts or get paid $500,000

595
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:59,333
to write a book or
get $100,000 to speak.

596
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,458
Here's the good news,
you can do it,

597
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,792
it's going to come
down to how good you are

598
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:04,291
because what I
know that you know

599
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,208
that everybody
knows is, you know,

600
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,000
you're getting paid for
the access of the phone call

601
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,542
and the curation of the content

602
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,125
because the content is free.

603
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,959
They can go find that
stuff, there's the tried

604
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,333
and true principles of lifestyle
and health and benefits.

605
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,500
They're established.

606
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,959
I think what you
need to think about is

607
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:22,333
how you disproportionally,
disproportionally bring value

608
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,542
to your audience.

609
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:27,333
The reason I wrote the Thank You
Economy after Crush It!

610
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,625
This is where you
turn to the books.

611
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,542
Ty, thank you.

612
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:32,625
The reason I wrote Thank You
Economy after Crush It! was,

613
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,000
Crush It! was, hey
everybody can do this.

614
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,917
Thank You Economy is, oh crap,

615
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:38,208
everybody's going to do this,

616
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,125
let me help people
figure out how to win

617
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,250
in a world where it's
going to be very competitive.

618
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,583
Bro, I'm telling
you something right now.

619
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,750
Every word out of your mouth
was, what's in it for you.

620
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,959
If you switch it into
what's in it for them,

621
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:52,166
you will have a chance.

622
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,208
- [Brian] Mhmmm.
- Period.

623
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,542
- [Brian] No,
absolutely, absolutely.

624
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:56,375
- I promise you if I go
onto your Instagram account

625
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,041
right now that
there's comments on your posts

626
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,792
and I promise you
didn't reply to all of them.

627
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:02,667
- [Brian] That's not true.

628
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,417
You check it out.
- I will.

629
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:05,625
I want you to.
- I'm doing it right now.

630
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,291
- What's your Instagram handle?

631
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,083
- [Brian] Brian Pickowitz.

632
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:13,000
P-I-C-K-O-W-I-T-Z.

633
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,375
- Bri, is it one word, 
or space, or Brian?

634
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,750
- [Brian] Yeah, just one word,
just one word.

635
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,375
- Brian P-I.

636
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:23,583
- [Brian] C-K-O-W-I-T-Z.

637
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:27,917
- Yep, I see it.
Dude you're in good shape.

638
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:29,458
- [Brian] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

639
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,125
- [Brian] Thank you,
this is my life (laughs).

640
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,875
- Alright, good job.

641
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,542
One thing I wasn't anticipating
was three comments (laughs).

642
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:39,792
(group laughter)

643
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:41,291
Dude.

644
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,500
Yeah, okay, so what's awesome,

645
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,959
first of all, is I'm pumped
that that's your mentality.

646
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:47,208
The problem is...

647
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,500
So, first of all,
kudos to Brian.

648
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,708
He's absolutely right
that he is getting in there

649
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:53,375
and engaging.

650
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,083
So, first of all, I'm
fucking pumped with you.

651
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,583
Sorry.
(Brian laughing)

652
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:01,250
The thing that does concern
me is the stunning low amount

653
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,667
of comments off your 4,000 base.

654
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:05,417
Did you build that organically

655
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:06,667
or have you ever done anything

656
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:10,834
that made it go to 4,000 like
a contest or something random?

657
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:12,375
Tell me.

658
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,500
- [Brian] I've never
bought any, quietly entertained

659
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,417
and the like...

660
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,333
I've pretty much have been

661
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,125
building this
the last two years.

662
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,208
So, very organic.

663
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:22,500
I do try to reach
out to my audience.

664
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,750
Asking more questions and
trying to get more feedback.

665
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,208
I find that, that usually
comes through DM's though.

666
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,875
- Yeah, I agree. I agree.

667
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,125
- [Brian] Not necessarily.

668
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,125
Most people, I get...

669
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,708
With what I do it's
so hard for some people

670
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:37,041
to want to ask for advice.

671
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,583
So, I find that a lot of times

672
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,917
what I get is the
private message on the side

673
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:43,333
and obviously, that's where
it helps to put in the work.

674
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:44,834
I get putting it
on the other aspect

675
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:48,166
of putting it out in the
open is a little bit hard.

676
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,125
- Yeah, and as far as
the YouTube front goes

677
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,500
I would just say if you
want to crush it on YouTube

678
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,375
all the information is
out there. Go to Google,

679
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,542
type in YouTube,
click on the news,

680
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,500
find out what
the latest news is.

681
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,542
Type in YouTube SEO.

682
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:01,500
Really hone in your
titles and descriptions.

683
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,083
Do things that are timely.

684
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,291
Caption your videos
because YouTube doesn't

685
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:07,208
really care as much
about the tags anymore

686
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:07,959
like they used to.

687
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:10,583
They do really care
about your actual captions

688
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:11,708
and what's said in the video.

689
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,208
If we're doing a
video about boxing,

690
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,458
I'm going to mention
Floyd Mayweather, Manny Pacquiao

691
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:16,750
when I'm talking
about a punching bag

692
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,750
because I know that it's going

693
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,917
to be picked up in the captions

694
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:20,750
and then hopefully
that will be picked up

695
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,750
in the suggested views

696
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,834
if somebody's watching
a Manny Pacquiao video.

697
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:24,500
So, I would do that.

698
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,750
Think about your timing, try
to find a regular schedule.

699
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,375
YouTube loves regular schedules.

700
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,083
- He said
something very important.

701
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,834
Listen, he said be timely.

702
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:34,375
That means hack culture, right?

703
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:37,250
You're talking about
lifestyle, fitness, health.

704
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:41,667
You got to be smart
being aggressive when

705
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:43,417
Arnold Schwarzenegger
is in the news.

706
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:45,875
When something is
happening in fitness.

707
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:50,291
When the competitions are on
ESPN, World's Strongest Men.

708
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:53,750
Be smart about
what's going on in culture.

709
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,583
- [Brian] Okay.
- Alright buddy.

710
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,500
- [Brian] That helps
out a lot actually.

711
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,417
- Alright, good luck.

712
00:23:57,417 --> 00:23:58,250
Good stuff.
- Yeah.

713
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,792
Alright, let's keep it going.

714
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:02,625
So Linc, while we're
getting the next phone call,

715
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:05,041
what's the most

716
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,625
exciting thing that has happened

717
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:09,667
because of this whole process?

718
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:13,291
- I've love traveling,
I've love seeing new places

719
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:16,250
and exploring. That's
something I've love to do

720
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,959
and is so much fun.

721
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:20,542
- So I know that when we were
hanging out the last time,

722
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,208
you went to Paris for
example for like 20 hours.

723
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,250
(phone ringing)

724
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,542
- Yeah.
- That was the coolest.

725
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:27,375
- Yeah that was so much fun!
I just love traveling.

726
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:30,458
- I get it I mean,
that's it you love it.

727
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,959
- Yeah. Love it.

728
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:33,834
- [Ari] Hello?

729
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:36,875
- Hello this is GaryVee
on The #AskGaryVee Show.

730
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,417
- [Ari] Oh my
gosh that's awesome, hi!

731
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:41,583
- Hi what's your name
and we are you from?

732
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:44,625
- [Ari] Hi my name
is Ari Cobb and I am from

733
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,208
New Orleans, Louisiana.

734
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:47,917
- Have you been to New Orleans?

735
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:48,500
- No.

736
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,417
- Sounds like dad
we need to make a trip.

737
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:50,166
- I've never been there either.

738
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,208
- Alright so
what's your question?

739
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:54,583
- [Ari] Oh my god I can't
believe this is happening.

740
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:57,417
Okay my question is

741
00:24:57,417 --> 00:25:00,959
I wanted to know since
you're all about inspiration

742
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,959
and everything,

743
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,583
I've been feeling a little bit

744
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:07,708
unmotivated and
I've been feeling like

745
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:09,000
I should be doing something

746
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,458
or I should be,

747
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:13,625
just I feel like
I should be pulled in like,

748
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,959
I'm feeling uninspired
basically that's my question

749
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:18,041
how do you get,

750
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:19,458
when you lose inspiration

751
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:21,917
or you lost motivation
how do you get it back?

752
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:27,083
- I get it back by remembering
that you might die tomorrow.

753
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:28,708
- [Ari] That's true.

754
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:30,667
- So I'm inspired

755
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:33,125
by practicality and reality

756
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:35,041
and the truth which is

757
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:37,959
it is ridiculously impossible
to become a human being.

758
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:40,750
I am one, I have other
good things going for me

759
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,083
as a human being
and I'm just grateful.

760
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,875
You're dwelling and
looking at what you don't have

761
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:48,375
versus looking at what you have.

762
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:51,500
If you actually
looked at what you had,

763
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,834
your health,

764
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:55,333
you know, living in America

765
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:57,500
who the heck knows
what would be on your list

766
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,291
if you actually spent all your
time looking at that versus

767
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:04,333
I don't have a million
dollars, I'm not famous,

768
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:06,417
I don't have this,

769
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:07,458
if you spent all your time

770
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:09,792
on what you have
versus what you don't have

771
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,625
you would be the
happiest girl on Earth.

772
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:16,208
- [Ari] I didn't
think about it like that.

773
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,417
- I'm aware that's
why you're uninspired.

774
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:19,959
(Ari laughs)

775
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:21,667
You know, that's
what's happening.

776
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,166
You're spending clearly

777
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,667
and you're
dragging yourself down

778
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,917
into what you don't have right?

779
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:27,708
- [Ari] Yeah.

780
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:28,959
- You've been spending your--
How do you

781
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,333
- Go ahead.

782
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:34,250
- [Ari] How do you
just, like when you're

783
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,750
I doubt that you
ever feel negative

784
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,667
'cause you
appreciate everything just

785
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:38,834
how do you just,

786
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:40,750
I feel so negative all the time

787
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,333
and like you said I do always
dwell on what I don't have

788
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:45,208
and just
everything that's going wrong

789
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:49,041
how do you stay
positive and motivated?

790
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,166
- Lincoln how do you stay
so positive I'll get to that

791
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:53,583
in a second but I wanna
incorporate my guests here.

792
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:55,917
And you're a young man
you haven't lived that long.

793
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:56,875
- (laughs) Yeah

794
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:59,208
- But when you're
down what do you do?

795
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:01,417
- (Sigh).

796
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:03,000
- Do you ever get down?

797
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,041
- Sometimes yeah.
- Okay.

798
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:08,083
- I just see what I
could be doing right now

799
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,625
instead of just

800
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:11,041
looking at it

801
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:13,959
and just being sad about that
instead of looking forward

802
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:16,083
to how to fix it.

803
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:16,875
- Dad?

804
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:19,333
- That's good I think for me
I was born in the Philippines,

805
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:22,291
really, really poor place
I lived there for two years

806
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,166
when I was 19 years old

807
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:27,291
and I feel like that
side of it is something that,

808
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:29,750
it's interesting because I go
to the Philippines whenever

809
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,625
we go back, we went
back there a couple years ago

810
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,917
I see how poor people are but
yet they're like the happiest

811
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:36,458
people in the world and I'm
like how is that possible?

812
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:37,792
But then when I come back to
America--

813
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:39,250
- 'Cause money
doesn't buy happiness

814
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,417
- Yeah but then it's
interesting--

815
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:42,750
- Money doesn't buy happiness

816
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,458
- You forget too you
know even though I was born

817
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:48,875
in those poor circumstances
I come after being in America

818
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,083
for a year you get
caught up in all those things

819
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,417
and it, I think coming
back to that whatever it is

820
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:54,667
that grounds you
whether it's your family,

821
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:56,083
getting out
there and just working

822
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:58,667
or serving other people being
thankful for what you have

823
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:00,208
like whatever it is that
grounds you if you can get

824
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:02,417
back to that point and
feel grateful and thankful

825
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:04,417
and cut those things out
your life that you don't need

826
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:05,834
that helps you bring happiness.

827
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:08,166
- Ari how old are you and
what are the top three things

828
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:10,500
that are bringing you down?

829
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,750
- [Ari] I'm 20 years old.

830
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,291
- Two, zero.

831
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:15,000
- [Ari] Yes.

832
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,041
- Okay, and so what's
making you Debbie Downer?

833
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:25,458
- [Ari] I'm in school
right now and I'm down just

834
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:29,250
because I'm just
stressed out because I feel that

835
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,917
when I get out of
school I'm not going to have

836
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,542
anything to do,

837
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:36,542
I'm down because when I train

838
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:39,208
I'm not as good
as I would like to be

839
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:41,458
and

840
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:43,375
it's mainly
just being negative

841
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:45,500
and being too hard on myself.

842
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,875
- Right and so do you think

843
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:50,208
that stems from the
way you were parented?

844
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:54,375
- [Ari] Yes and no, I was
really sheltered as a kid,

845
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:56,959
in kind of like, my
mom treated me like I was

846
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:59,291
a special little snowflake,

847
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:02,458
which is not the case anymore.

848
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:04,625
- Or maybe you are, in
just a different way that

849
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:06,625
your mom then created it, right?

850
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,834
Like, in theory,
everybody makes fun

851
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:10,708
of the modern parenting,
and everybody makes

852
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,458
their kids feel
like they're the best,

853
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:13,750
and now the kids are saying,

854
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,959
"Oh crap, I was confused,
I thought I was the best,"

855
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:19,250
but the reality is we have
to take on the responsibility

856
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,959
of ourselves, like my
mom told me I was the best,

857
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:23,875
I equally spent
all my time thinking

858
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:26,750
that I was not the best,
because I could understand

859
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,834
that I wasn't winning in
every single thing always.

860
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,000
You know what I mean?

861
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,708
I mean,
- [Ari] Yeah.

862
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:32,625
- She might've
created that sheltered thing,

863
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,834
but I promise you,
you realize pretty quickly

864
00:29:34,834 --> 00:29:36,959
in first, second,
fourth, ninth grade,

865
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:40,083
there was things that you
weren't the best at, right?

866
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,291
- [Ari] True, very true.

867
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:44,708
- Whose opinion
are you worried about?

868
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:49,333
- [Ari] I'm worried
about the opinion of

869
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:52,708
the people that I train with,

870
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:56,375
the people that have
invested so much time in me.

871
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:59,041
- And what are we talking
about training-wise?

872
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:00,750
In what?

873
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,333
- [Ari] I'm an Olympic lifter
and I do mixed martial arts.

874
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:04,834
- Woah.
- Wow. Okay.

875
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:08,792
- [Ari] And I, oh I'm sorry.

876
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:10,750
- No, go ahead, what
does "an Olympic lifter" mean?

877
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,208
Like, you might go to the
Olympics, or you're in it?

878
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:14,041
Explain that to me.

879
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:15,792
- [Ari] Oh, God, no I wish.
- Got it.

880
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:18,959
- [Ari] Olympic lifting is the
snatch and the clean and jerk

881
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:23,208
and it's different movements
that you do with the barbell.

882
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:26,583
- So what, can you
please tell me this, Ari?

883
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:28,708
You literally go
into your room sometimes,

884
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:31,000
like after a workout, and say,

885
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,500
"Damn it, I wish I
lifted 10 more pounds"?

886
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,125
- [Ari] That, and
it's just, I feel like

887
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:40,291
I could've tried harder,
that I could've done more,

888
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:42,083
that I could've
had a better attitude.

889
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:44,208
- Ari, did you see the
video that I posted on YouTube

890
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:47,083
that says 'you need
to be your biggest fan'?

891
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:47,917
- [Ari] Yes.

892
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:50,792
- You need to watch that
eight thousand times in a row.

893
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:52,250
- [Ari] Okay.

894
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,834
- Listen, Ari let me give you
a really good piece of advice.

895
00:30:54,834 --> 00:30:58,083
The rest of the world is gonna
critique you and judge you.

896
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:01,500
You need to stop
doing that for yourself.

897
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:03,500
- [Ari] Okay.

898
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,708
- I'm being dead
serious with you.

899
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:06,583
- I think the other
side is just this day and age

900
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:08,750
in social media, a lot of
people, even with our videos,

901
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,375
they see the video,
they see us traveling,

902
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:11,834
they see the
glamorous side of things,

903
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:13,750
but then maybe they
don't see the other side,

904
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,542
where it's just,
we're regular people,

905
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,959
like there's no difference
between the way we live

906
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,708
than any other people live,
like we have our down times.

907
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:22,792
Sometimes we're sad,
sometimes things can be hard,

908
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:26,208
but I think it's important
to not compare ourselves

909
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,959
to other people on
social media and see

910
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:29,125
all the glamorous stuff.
- Are you envious

911
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:31,041
of what you're seeing on social?

912
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:34,125
- [Ari] Yes, I'm very envious
and that's a big problem.

913
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm a very envious person.

914
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,125
- Ari, I'm not
envious of anybody.

915
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:43,000
You need to figure
out how to really become

916
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,083
a bigger fan of yourself,
and not be...

917
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:46,500
Listen, if you're
aware of these things,

918
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,625
and I don't know if
it's going to see somebody,

919
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:50,708
I don't know if
there's a system in place,

920
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,333
but you're not
gonna win this game

921
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,917
if you continue down this path.

922
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:00,125
- [Ari] Yeah, I know
I'm not. I'm just gonna,

923
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:02,583
self-loathing is not
gonna get me anywhere,

924
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:04,333
I just don't know how to fix it.

925
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:07,208
- Yeah. I respect that, and
like, I'm not a psychiatrist

926
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:10,375
or you know, I just
wanna get these things outta

927
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,708
your mouth
because I think they help,

928
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:16,917
but you've gotta
realize you got it so good.

929
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:18,750
(grunts)

930
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,542
There's seven point seven
billion people on this Earth.

931
00:32:21,542 --> 00:32:24,500
Ari, you rank in
the top percentile

932
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,917
just be being in New Orleans.

933
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,667
- She's Olympic lifting.

934
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:31,917
I can't, I'm too skinny,
I can't even do that.

935
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:34,583
(laughing)
- She doesn't have

936
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,125
a disease currently, like,

937
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:39,834
Ari you really gotta get
your perspective in order.

938
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:40,959
- [Andy] Break the pattern.

939
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:45,834
- You gotta break the pattern.
That's exactly right.

940
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:48,959
- Ari, you have it awesome.

941
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,625
- [Ari] Yeah.

942
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:56,834
- I mean it.

943
00:32:56,834 --> 00:32:59,667
You just need to believe it now.

944
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:04,041
- [Ari] Yeah. I'm
gonna work on that.

945
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:05,583
- I have good news for
you, you live in New Orleans.

946
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:10,291
There's some shitty
neighborhoods. Go take a ride.

947
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:11,542
- [Ari] That is true.

948
00:33:11,542 --> 00:33:12,750
- Wake the fuck up.
- [Ari] There's some

949
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,583
shit down here.

950
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:14,917
- Wake the fuck up.

951
00:33:14,917 --> 00:33:18,083
The majority of people
have it worse than you.

952
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,375
Sorry.

953
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,750
- [Ari] Yeah.

954
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,583
- Yeah. I need a
more emphatic "yeah".

955
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:27,625
- [Ari] Yeah! You're right.

956
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:28,458
- And that's it.

957
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:29,875
- [Ari] I'm
writing all this down.

958
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,417
- I have a news
alert by the way.

959
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:34,125
Nobody cares about
your problems either.

960
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:34,917
- [Ari] Yeah.

961
00:33:34,917 --> 00:33:37,125
- Like, too many people think
their dwelling and complaining

962
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:39,041
leads to an action,
because they grew up

963
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:40,667
in environments where it did.

964
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:43,792
Problem is, mom's
not around anymore.

965
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:48,375
- [Ari] We all got shit, man.

966
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:50,417
- We all got shit.

967
00:33:50,417 --> 00:33:52,166
- [Ari] We all got shit.
- Yep.

968
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:55,083
So, I'm telling you: the
number one thing that I do

969
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:57,542
when I get dangerously,
and I'm never there,

970
00:33:57,542 --> 00:34:00,500
but I fix my perspective.

971
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,750
Get in your car
right now, and go drive

972
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,708
around parts of New Orleans.

973
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:08,166
You could wake up real
fast, if you choose to.

974
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,500
- [Ari] Okay.
- Good.

975
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,875
- [Ari] You're absolutely right.

976
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:15,333
- Oh, that I know.
I'm just sitting here,

977
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,500
and keeping you on the phone,

978
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,333
(Ari laughing)
'cause I'm trying

979
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,000
to think of a way
to get you to know.

980
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,375
You know?

981
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:21,750
- [Ari] Yeah.

982
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,792
- Good luck, update us, okay?

983
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:24,667
- [Ari] Thank you.

984
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:26,083
- You're welcome.

985
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:28,041
- What do you think?

986
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:30,208
- It's a tough one,
'cause she has to believe

987
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:31,875
withinin herself, and
not compare herself

988
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:32,875
- And this is a common theme,
- to other people, and it's,

989
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,166
it is.
- where there was a vibe there

990
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:36,750
not so different than Taylor's,

991
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,125
that we had the other day.

992
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:39,917
This whole, like,
"Other people have it better,

993
00:34:39,917 --> 00:34:41,417
"I don't have it as good," like,

994
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:43,958
it's just not real, and
people are allowing themselves

995
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:46,458
to go down this
rabbit hole, and you know,

996
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:48,792
you were super happy
when you weren't making,

997
00:34:48,792 --> 00:34:50,917
people were saying, "oh,
it's easy for him to say,

998
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:52,291
"he's getting $50,000 brand deals",

999
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:54,333
but you were
happy when you weren't!

1000
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:55,250
- Right, right.

1001
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,417
- Like, it's not a money thing.
It's a mindset thing.

1002
00:34:58,417 --> 00:35:01,041
And you gotta figure out
how to break that pattern.

1003
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:02,625
- Yeah. It doesn't matter
how rich or how poor you are.

1004
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,250
You gotta find
that within yourself,

1005
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,667
(phone ringing)
what makes you happy.

1006
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:07,291
- [Andy] Swardik.

1007
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:08,417
- But, I'm glad
she's willing to ask.

1008
00:35:08,417 --> 00:35:09,250
That's a good step.

1009
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,083
(phone ringing)

1010
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:11,083
- Well, the reason
I'm keeping people on

1011
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:12,542
is the fact that people
are even saying it out loud,

1012
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:13,834
because 99% don't.

1013
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:14,667
- [Q] Hello?

1014
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:15,500
- Hey, it's GaryVee,

1015
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,417
and you're on
The #AskGaryVee Show.

1016
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:19,375
- [Q] Holy shit.

1017
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:20,250
Thank you so much.

1018
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,708
Oh my God. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1019
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:22,500
- You're welcome.

1020
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,250
What's your name,
and where are you from?

1021
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,542
- [Q] My name
is Swardic Mayanja.

1022
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:29,583
I'm from Woburn, Massachusets.

1023
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:32,417
Everyone calls me Q,
just like the letter.

1024
00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:35,250
- Alright, Q, I've got
a very important question.

1025
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,500
- [Q] Please.

1026
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,208
- Are you a Patriots fan?

1027
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:40,542
- [Q] Oh, of
course I'm a Patriots fan.

1028
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:41,500
I'm sorry.

1029
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,208
(group laughter)

1030
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:44,875
- Alright, Q,
I had to do it to you,

1031
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:47,834
but I promise you that I will
call you back another time.

1032
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:49,625
I'm just not in
the mood right now.

1033
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,250
I'm still bitter.

1034
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,875
Let's move on.
- Oh my gosh.

1035
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:53,917
- Keep it going.

1036
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:55,250
- Oh, don't ask
Lincoln any of that.

1037
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,083
Kick us out now.

1038
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,375
- Lincoln's a Patriots guy, too?

1039
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:00,083
- There's one player
on there that he loves

1040
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:02,583
that just maybe went
on there six months ago.

1041
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:04,250
- Okay, he doesn't bother me.

1042
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,250
- We're college guys, but yeah.

1043
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,083
- That's fine.

1044
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,458
- That's great.

1045
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,000
Nope, not the other
guy you're thinking of.

1046
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,291
(phone ringing)
- That's the guy.

1047
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:12,208
I could have ended this meeting.

1048
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:15,375
Hey it's GaryVee, and you're
on The #AskGaryVee Show.

1049
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:18,083
- [David] Holy fucking
shit, are you serious?

1050
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:18,667
- I am.

1051
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:20,667
What's your name
and where you're from?

1052
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:24,291
- [David] Yeah, this is
David Trotter from Jersey City.

1053
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:25,708
Jersey love in the house, baby.

1054
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:26,959
- Alright, David,
what's going on man?

1055
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:28,542
What's your question?

1056
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:29,792
And can you turn that
down in the background

1057
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:31,083
because it's echoing.

1058
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:32,250
- [David] Yeah, hold on.

1059
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,208
I'm like driving in my car.

1060
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:35,083
Let me just pull over.

1061
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:36,250
- Yeah, pull over.

1062
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,375
Because we don't need a death.

1063
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:38,583
Yeah, go ahead.

1064
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:41,583
- [David] Alright, so,
first off, Gary,

1065
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:43,375
I came to see
you're whole company man.

1066
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:44,291
You flew away.

1067
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:45,125
You weren't even there.

1068
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:46,625
I missed you.
- I'm sorry, man.

1069
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:47,625
- [David] Brought
my whole house.

1070
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,291
- I apologize.[
- [David] That's alright.

1071
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,708
I'll see you again. All good.

1072
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,291
Anyway, so I just partnered

1073
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:56,166
into to a wine company.

1074
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:59,166
I'm a 15% partner,
my fiance is the other 15%.

1075
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,125
We have a 70% partner.

1076
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:02,583
I think you actually did them

1077
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:04,458
on Wine Library
way back in the day.

1078
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,333
It's called David's Family Wine.
- Okay.

1079
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:07,375
- [David] Formed
with Michelle Reeves.

1080
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:08,208
- Yep.

1081
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:09,041
- [David] I don't know
if you remember them.

1082
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:10,750
- I remember them

1083
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,208
- [David] So, it's
been great bottle of wine,

1084
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:14,792
but the brand has kind of been
dead the past three years.

1085
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:16,208
Michelle lived in New York,

1086
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:18,083
moved over to the West Coast,

1087
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:21,208
and had two kids and went

1088
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:23,125
from doing $300,000 a year

1089
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:25,375
down to $80,000 a year.

1090
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:28,375
And, you know, I have
a hospitality company.

1091
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:30,000
She roped me in
because we're doing events

1092
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,875
all over New York, New Jersey,

1093
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,750
and she's like look, I think
you'd be a great partner

1094
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,625
to kind of reinvigorate it.

1095
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:39,667
We're trying to figure
out what the next strategy is

1096
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:40,792
for the company.

1097
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:43,542
I tend to think it's a
couple of different angles,

1098
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:44,792
like we have the idea,

1099
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:46,542
obviously like distribution,

1100
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:47,750
like we're in Gramercy Tavern,

1101
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:48,959
we're in Eleven Madison Park.

1102
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:50,542
Reinvigorating those sales.

1103
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:53,250
The other angle
would be, obviously,

1104
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,959
the direct to consumer angle
that we added to our website,

1105
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:58,000
and then I kinda
had this crazy idea

1106
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,875
like why don't we
screw all of this stuff

1107
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:02,166
and go around it.

1108
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:04,875
We do 500 cases a year,
why don't we just do a bunch

1109
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:05,959
of really cool events,

1110
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:08,250
and maybe the only way
that you can get the wine

1111
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,959
is, you know,
through these events.

1112
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:13,000
I tend to think the GaryVee
answer might be all of them.

1113
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,834
So I wanted to throw that out
there and see what you said

1114
00:38:15,834 --> 00:38:17,875
you thought might
be a really good idea.

1115
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:19,166
- This show's eventually
not going to be fun,

1116
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:21,125
because I'm super
pissed that you took my answer.

1117
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:25,000
(group laughter)

1118
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,834
- [David] Sorry!

1119
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:27,667
- I mean, look, not sorry.
It makes me happy.

1120
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:30,333
It means that people
are hearing me, right?

1121
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:31,458
The answer's all
of them, brother.

1122
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:34,041
Now look, the
model of doing events

1123
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,792
that it's the only way to buy it

1124
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:37,583
would then
eliminate the other two.

1125
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:39,500
I wouldn't go that hard.

1126
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,542
I would just still do events,
but I would create as many...

1127
00:38:42,542 --> 00:38:43,834
Too many times
people don't understand

1128
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:46,125
that you need to
create as many ways for people

1129
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:47,750
to buy as possible, right?

1130
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,625
They may discover
it at a restaurant.

1131
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:50,750
They may walk
into the Wine Library

1132
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,542
and buy it off the shelf.

1133
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:54,875
They may go to a
party and taste it

1134
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,250
and then go buy it.

1135
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,500
You've gotta do
direct-to-consumer branding

1136
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,959
on Instagram and Facebook for
your direct to consumer channel,

1137
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:04,208
directly from the
winery because you get to keep

1138
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,041
100% of the economics,

1139
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:08,083
instead of sharing it with
the retailer and distributor.

1140
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:10,375
So, there's a
million ways to do it.

1141
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:12,333
It sounds like you're
pretty grounded in it.

1142
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:14,250
I have a funny
feeling above and beyond

1143
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,834
the answer I just gave you,
you know the next answer

1144
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:18,750
which is it's just patience.

1145
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,542
It sounds like you're grounded.

1146
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:22,041
It's just a matter of time,

1147
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:23,250
and you've gotta
think about the details.

1148
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,834
I think one of the
great things that my partners

1149
00:39:24,834 --> 00:39:26,375
here on this episode have done,

1150
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:27,834
is they talk about the nuances.

1151
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:28,792
Here's a nuance,

1152
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:30,959
be smarter about how you guys,

1153
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:33,250
and what you put on
the label of the wine.

1154
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:37,000
Is your social handles on
the back of the label, right?

1155
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,542
Can you induce
people to share it

1156
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,250
by doing a hashtag on
the back of the label.

1157
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,542
So, it's some of
these nuances, as well,

1158
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:44,959
but it sounds like
you've got the religion down,

1159
00:39:44,959 --> 00:39:47,583
which excites me
around the strategy.

1160
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,792
- [David] Hey, man, listen--

1161
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:53,417
- Hello?

1162
00:39:53,417 --> 00:39:55,500
Oh, he was about to say
something really cool about me.

1163
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,917
(group laughter)

1164
00:39:57,917 --> 00:39:58,625
I took that one,

1165
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:00,458
because I wasn't sure
that you were really ready

1166
00:40:00,458 --> 00:40:02,917
to give a detailed wine answer

1167
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:04,041
at this point in your career.

1168
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:06,208
- Yeah.
- You've drank no wine yet.

1169
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:08,041
- No.
- Okay, understood.

1170
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:09,208
(group laughter)

1171
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:11,708
- [Andy] I saw
Swardic just comment

1172
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:12,542
- Q?

1173
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:14,750
- [Andy] Q. Please call me
in the next #AskGaryVee,

1174
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,125
but I truly
respect your decision.

1175
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:18,333
(group laughter)
- Let's call Q back.

1176
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,375
I'm happy he said that.
Yeah, let's call him back.

1177
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:23,000
- [Andy] He has a
question about YouTube.

1178
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,083
- Good, let's do it.
(group laughter)

1179
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:27,708
That's a good job by Q.

1180
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:30,166
Q, way to handle that adversity.

1181
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:31,959
Right?
He didn't dwell.

1182
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:32,792
- Yep.

1183
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:33,625
- He figured out how to fix it.

1184
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:34,917
He did it buy
doing a public Tweet.

1185
00:40:34,917 --> 00:40:36,291
(phone ringing)

1186
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:38,417
And, Q has won this episode

1187
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:39,959
of The #AskGaryVee Show.

1188
00:40:41,417 --> 00:40:43,917
- Just like they win
the Super Bowl every year. Yep.

1189
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:45,542
- [Q] Hello?
(laughing)

1190
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:46,792
- Q!

1191
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:48,583
- [Q] Yes.
- I respect what you did.

1192
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:50,792
I like the way you
handled the adversity,

1193
00:40:50,792 --> 00:40:52,041
and so we're rewarding it.

1194
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:55,125
You are now back, first
time ever, two-time caller,

1195
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:59,542
on The #AskGaryVee Show,
and Lincoln's fired up!

1196
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:00,834
- [Q] I truly,
truly respect that.

1197
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:01,667
I do, I do.

1198
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,792
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1199
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:04,875
- What's your question?
- [Q] Oh my God.

1200
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,291
So, I just started a
brand-new YouTube channel,

1201
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:09,375
and it's like,
from the beginning,

1202
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:11,166
it's super,
super, super difficult

1203
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:14,250
just breaking and
making a name for yourself.

1204
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,208
- As it should be.

1205
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:17,041
- [Q] I wanna
know real talk though.

1206
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,333
Yes, yes, as it should be.

1207
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:20,125
But, I wanna
know, like real talk,

1208
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:22,959
where should I go,
because I'm lucky enough

1209
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:25,125
where people in my life,
people who surround me

1210
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:26,375
are all really supportive,

1211
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:29,417
but I need people
who are truly, truly real

1212
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:33,750
at giving me critical, you
know, constructive criticism.

1213
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,333
Just tell me what
I'm doing right, wrong.

1214
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:37,542
Everyone's like oh,
that's cute, that's nice,

1215
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:40,041
good for you, but I don't
know if it's actually good,

1216
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:41,417
because I just know these people

1217
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:42,959
so basically, like my mom,

1218
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,375
telling me they
love me and it's good.

1219
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:47,375
- When it comes to YouTube,
this is a really good question,

1220
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:48,625
like we hear this a lot,

1221
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:50,166
and if you look at our channel,

1222
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:52,417
I didn't share that
we had a YouTube channel

1223
00:41:52,417 --> 00:41:55,000
with my co-workers,
my parents, with my family,

1224
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,542
until we hit
100,000 subscribers,

1225
00:41:57,542 --> 00:41:58,750
and we were in the news.

1226
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,417
- [Q] Holy shit.

1227
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:01,083
- But we had a
bunch of different videos

1228
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:02,291
that we tried different things.

1229
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:04,667
We didn't think we'd
become these huge YouTubers,

1230
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:06,417
but that's the kind
of bit of advice I have

1231
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:08,708
is that what I see as a
big problem that people do

1232
00:42:08,708 --> 00:42:09,917
is that they will
go put a bunch of money

1233
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:11,125
behind a YouTube channel,

1234
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:12,083
and they will throw it out there

1235
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,125
to all of their
Facebook friends and family,

1236
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:16,875
and they'll go on a
give them artificial views,

1237
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:19,000
and then they'll give
them these positive comments,

1238
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
and then you start feeling
like oh this is a good idea,

1239
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,625
but even if all of your Facebook
friends watched your video

1240
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,708
every single day
for the entire week,

1241
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:27,291
you're not gonna make
any money off the channel.

1242
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:28,375
It's not going
to grow that much.

1243
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:29,959
It really does take,

1244
00:42:29,959 --> 00:42:31,917
you have that global audience.

1245
00:42:31,917 --> 00:42:35,583
The beauty about not telling
everyone what you're doing

1246
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:37,583
on your YouTube
channel until you find an idea,

1247
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:39,083
like ours was
cutting stuff open,

1248
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:39,959
that's what took,

1249
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:40,750
but some of the other videos

1250
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,708
we just made the videos private.

1251
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:44,917
The beauty of that is
you have the whole world

1252
00:42:44,917 --> 00:42:46,083
that can look at your channel

1253
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,625
and they can give you feedback,

1254
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:48,792
and sometimes they're pretty,

1255
00:42:48,792 --> 00:42:49,792
they're always honest.

1256
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:51,208
Like, they're brutally honest,

1257
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:52,792
and that way you
don't live off of like

1258
00:42:52,792 --> 00:42:55,708
oh, my mom said it's good,
or my family said it's good.

1259
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:56,875
You can find an idea,

1260
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:58,542
and then finally
find out what works,

1261
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,375
and what your
niche is on YouTube,

1262
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:01,875
and then go all-in.

1263
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:04,125
Hide everything else,
create a new brand,

1264
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:05,750
and just go for it.

1265
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,458
- [Q] So, just to
follow up on that.

1266
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:09,708
So, now they know and
I can't go back on that.

1267
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:10,542
- Yeah.

1268
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:14,417
- [Q] Like I have
over 100 videos up,

1269
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:16,542
and basically my channel is,

1270
00:43:16,542 --> 00:43:17,834
I interview people,

1271
00:43:17,834 --> 00:43:19,875
and it's called like
the Everyday Hero Series.

1272
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:22,792
So, I interview
every day people, right?

1273
00:43:22,792 --> 00:43:24,083
And, I consider them heroes,

1274
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:25,375
and they tell me
why they are a hero,

1275
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:26,708
why they are special,

1276
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:28,083
and that's my idea.

1277
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:30,667
- How long have
you been doing it,

1278
00:43:30,667 --> 00:43:34,000
and what do your
numbers look like?

1279
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,458
- [Q] So, my numbers
are pretty, pretty crappy.

1280
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:39,500
I've been doing this
series of this type thing

1281
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,166
for about two months now.

1282
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:45,375
I have like,
probably 35 to 40 videos up,

1283
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:49,166
of probably like 8 to
10 different interviews,

1284
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:50,458
and I'll chop them up.

1285
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:52,834
I'll put some on Instagram,
like a real short clip.

1286
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:54,458
I'll put the
longer videos on Facebook.

1287
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:55,458
- How many subscribers,

1288
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:58,208
and how many
views are these getting?

1289
00:43:58,208 --> 00:44:00,875
- [Q] I average
anywhere between like 10

1290
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:04,834
or 50 views and I have like
45 subscribers, I'm brand new.

1291
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:06,583
Like I started six months ago.

1292
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:10,583
- Okay, so what's,
why was the advice

1293
00:44:10,583 --> 00:44:13,750
that you were just
given not feasible?

1294
00:44:14,542 --> 00:44:16,417
- [Q] Come again?
Say that again please?

1295
00:44:16,417 --> 00:44:19,291
- So you just got some
great advice in my opinion,

1296
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:22,417
and then you said, well yeah
but, the cat's out of the bag.

1297
00:44:22,417 --> 00:44:23,333
They already know.

1298
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:25,750
Why did you dwell on
the fact that they know

1299
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:29,041
versus the strategy of
trying different things?

1300
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:32,708
- [Q] That's a good question.

1301
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:35,959
And the thing is,
I'm not dwelling on it.

1302
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:38,750
What I really do want
to go out and look for,

1303
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,583
is am I not just
getting exposure?

1304
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:43,500
Or does my idea suck?

1305
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,834
I want someone to tell me.

1306
00:44:44,834 --> 00:44:47,250
- Sure. But I have good news.

1307
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,250
Somebody told you.

1308
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:51,500
It's called the market.
They told you it sucks so far.

1309
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,959
- [Q] Okay, yes.

1310
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:56,625
- But, but,

1311
00:44:56,625 --> 00:45:00,500
Wine Library TV was told two
months in that it sucked.

1312
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,542
You were told, kind of sort
of, in the first couple months.

1313
00:45:03,542 --> 00:45:06,125
- It took a long time
til it actually took off.

1314
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:08,834
But it, you do have
to listen to the market

1315
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:10,125
and you have to look and see,

1316
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:12,375
does this video have
the potential to go viral?

1317
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:14,166
Are a lot of people
gonna be watching it?

1318
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:16,708
And if you're already looking,

1319
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:18,166
make sure your
looking at the algorithm,

1320
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:19,500
the advice I gave earlier.

1321
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,500
Make sure you're doing
all of those other things

1322
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,458
that you can
control, like your titles.

1323
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:26,250
The first line of the
description is super important.

1324
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,583
Then some of your
tags not as important.

1325
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:29,792
Make sure you're
captioning your videos.

1326
00:45:29,792 --> 00:45:33,125
But at some point you
want to look at it and say,

1327
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:34,583
this stuff isn't taking off.

1328
00:45:34,583 --> 00:45:36,375
Is there something
else I can do?

1329
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:38,250
And experiment with it, come
up with different thumbnails.

1330
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:39,834
- Q, I think you
should start making videos

1331
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:42,333
as the Boston guy
that hates the Patriots.

1332
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:44,542
(group laughter)

1333
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:47,959
Q, real quick, real quick, Q.

1334
00:45:47,959 --> 00:45:49,834
Why do you want to do this?

1335
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:51,458
Like straight up.
- [Q] Come again?

1336
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:52,917
- You want to become Casey?

1337
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,291
You want to make
$5 million dollars a year

1338
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:55,125
just making videos?

1339
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:55,834
What are you doing?

1340
00:45:55,834 --> 00:45:56,625
You want to be Ted Koppel,

1341
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:58,875
like why are we doing this?

1342
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:00,125
- [Q] Sort of like,
I'm going to be honest.

1343
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:01,417
- Hold on real quick,
real quick before

1344
00:46:01,417 --> 00:46:02,708
you answer that I
just had a thought.

1345
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:04,417
Do you know who Ted Koppel is?

1346
00:46:04,417 --> 00:46:05,500
Yeah, okay.
Go ahead.

1347
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,708
- [Q] Who?
- Yeah no, okay.

1348
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:09,458
Sorry Q.
You don't either, I get it.

1349
00:46:09,458 --> 00:46:11,750
So why are you doing this?

1350
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,458
- [Q] Because
I want to basically

1351
00:46:13,458 --> 00:46:15,208
be like the
male Ellen DeGeneres.

1352
00:46:15,208 --> 00:46:17,917
I want to be like Joe Rogan,
like the dream.

1353
00:46:17,917 --> 00:46:19,291
That's the dream.
- Great.

1354
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:20,208
- [Q] Like that's what
I want to do.

1355
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:22,125
- Great, if that's true,

1356
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:25,208
then you need to
stop calling shows and

1357
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:27,000
getting positive feedback or

1358
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,583
feedback two months into it.

1359
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:31,500
If you're trying to do that,

1360
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,375
you need to know that you
are on a ridiculous marathon

1361
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:38,917
and that most likely,
nothing good will happen

1362
00:46:38,917 --> 00:46:42,625
for the next seven to 11 years.

1363
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:44,125
- [Q] Seven to 11?

1364
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:45,625
- Yes sir.

1365
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:48,375
- [Q] Okay, I mean
that's absolutely legit.

1366
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:50,458
But then just a
little off topic,

1367
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:52,000
I'm sorry for taking
up so much of your time.

1368
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,250
- No problem. You're
not taking up my time.

1369
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,083
I just need you
to know something.

1370
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:56,417
- [Q] Yes.

1371
00:46:56,417 --> 00:46:59,625
- Whenever that
piece of advice comes out

1372
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:03,291
and the response is,
"Yes your right, but,"

1373
00:47:03,291 --> 00:47:07,000
you've already lost.
You know that right?

1374
00:47:09,667 --> 00:47:11,458
- [Q] Wow, okay.

1375
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:13,875
- That's the punchline, Q.

1376
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:17,000
The punchline is,
it's seven to 11 years.

1377
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,250
How old are you again?

1378
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,458
- [Q] 23.
- Great.

1379
00:47:21,458 --> 00:47:24,250
I'm telling you to your face,
you have no prayer

1380
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,458
of being Joe Rogan or

1381
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:27,959
Ellen DeGeneres for
the most part.

1382
00:47:27,959 --> 00:47:30,166
And if you do, I want
to remind you that

1383
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:33,041
both of them had
7 to 15 year careers

1384
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:36,291
before they even looked
to remotely close to Ellen.

1385
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:38,291
I just want to remind everyone
who's watching this show,

1386
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:40,041
I have been in
the public limelight

1387
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:42,000
producing content
on an everyday basis

1388
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,208
for the last 11 years.

1389
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:50,083
- [Q] Wow, okay.

1390
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:51,750
So like my
perspective is just...

1391
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,291
- Fucking broken.

1392
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:55,583
You're worried
about shit two months in

1393
00:47:55,583 --> 00:48:00,000
on a journey that is gonna
be the next 10 to 15 years.

1394
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:02,542
- [Q] Yeah.

1395
00:48:02,542 --> 00:48:06,917
- You're just not
in the right mindset.

1396
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:07,792
- [Q] That's real.

1397
00:48:07,792 --> 00:48:08,834
- And you know
what else is real?

1398
00:48:08,834 --> 00:48:11,458
You haven't Googled,
how do I get better titles?

1399
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:13,125
How do I use YouTube SEO.

1400
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:15,333
So you've lost on
the architect side

1401
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:17,500
and you're also
losing on the plumbing side.

1402
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,000
I won on the architect side.

1403
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,333
I don't know all your story,

1404
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,583
but you clearly won
on the plumbing side.

1405
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:26,417
And you're not playing either.

1406
00:48:27,792 --> 00:48:30,458
- [Q] Geez, lord. Okay.
- Alright?

1407
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:31,291
- [Q] Alright.

1408
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:33,750
- You know how you Patriot fans
make fun of shitty teams?

1409
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,083
That's what I'm
doing to you in reverse.

1410
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:36,875
This is how a Jets fan
feels good about himself.

1411
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:39,583
(group laughter)

1412
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,667
You know what, what I just did?

1413
00:48:41,667 --> 00:48:43,291
This is my favorite thing,
just a little side story.

1414
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:44,500
I never tell this.

1415
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,708
I'm such a bad human
being at sporting events.

1416
00:48:46,708 --> 00:48:48,542
I'm the worst
version of myself, Lincoln.

1417
00:48:48,542 --> 00:48:50,375
There's something
called beer muscles.

1418
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:52,291
This is where people
get drunk drinking beer,

1419
00:48:52,291 --> 00:48:53,458
stupid guys that are older

1420
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:54,542
and then they
want to fight people.

1421
00:48:54,542 --> 00:48:56,000
I have sports muscles.

1422
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,458
When I go into a stadium
I actually want to fight people.

1423
00:48:58,458 --> 00:49:00,125
I'm like the reverse of me.
- [Q] My goodness.

1424
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:02,250
- Yeah, so when
I go to Foxborough,

1425
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,041
Q you're gonna love this.

1426
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:05,458
When I got to Foxborough,
and I wear my Jets jersey

1427
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:06,917
and people start
making fun of me.

1428
00:49:06,917 --> 00:49:10,083
I change the conversation,
literally this is me

1429
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:12,917
arguing with a fan, but
the guys like, you suck.

1430
00:49:12,917 --> 00:49:13,834
Jets suck.

1431
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:14,959
I go yeah, yeah bro.

1432
00:49:14,959 --> 00:49:16,959
But what about me versus you.

1433
00:49:16,959 --> 00:49:18,542
(Q laughs)

1434
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:19,667
I'm like, tell
me about your life.

1435
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:22,625
Beause I'm 
beating you, dick face.

1436
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:24,417
- [Q] You get real petty
when you go to Foxborough.

1437
00:49:24,417 --> 00:49:25,708
- I get real angry.

1438
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:30,125
So listen man, your
macro and micro are broken.

1439
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:31,083
Fix both.

1440
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:33,750
Go spend 15 hours
researching on Google,

1441
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:36,208
how to become better at YouTube.

1442
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:38,417
And start realizing
you're on a marathon.

1443
00:49:38,417 --> 00:49:40,959
Take your sprinter shoes off.

1444
00:49:40,959 --> 00:49:42,458
- [Q] Yes.

1445
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:44,542
Gary, I totally appreciate this.

1446
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:47,458
- Go man. Good luck.

1447
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:50,625
- He doesn't get,
like I'm 37 years old.

1448
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:53,083
And I, like I said,
I started a few businesses

1449
00:49:53,083 --> 00:49:54,291
early on after reading books

1450
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:55,875
that got me really motivational.

1451
00:49:55,875 --> 00:49:57,250
Like I was this young kid with

1452
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,959
a global finance
degree and like I can do this.

1453
00:49:58,959 --> 00:50:01,041
But I kept my day
job for all these years.

1454
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:03,291
And it wasn't until
this was finally the thing,

1455
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,500
I never would
have thought it was

1456
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,875
like cutting
stuff open on YouTube.

1457
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:07,166
But that turned
out to be the thing

1458
00:50:07,166 --> 00:50:09,291
and now I can step away
from my day job and do this.

1459
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:10,875
But sometimes
you gotta experiment

1460
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:12,750
and be okay with
failing and walking away.

1461
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,250
And going, I just
learned something better

1462
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:15,125
than I could have
learned by spending

1463
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:16,500
the money of getting an MBA.

1464
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,375
Like I just
learned in the real world.

1465
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:19,875
- Go figure.

1466
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:22,291
Lincoln, the guests on this show

1467
00:50:22,291 --> 00:50:24,291
get to ask the
question of the day.

1468
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:26,625
I would love for you to
ask the question of the day.

1469
00:50:26,625 --> 00:50:31,667
What question to you
want to ask the Vayner Nation?

1470
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:33,417
By the way, it
could be anything.

1471
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:35,667
It doesn't have to be
the theme of the show.

1472
00:50:35,667 --> 00:50:38,458
It doesn't have to,
it could literally be like,

1473
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:39,625
what's your
favorite bubblegum flavor?

1474
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:41,542
Like what are you
actually curious about

1475
00:50:41,542 --> 00:50:42,959
to get thousands
of people to respond

1476
00:50:42,959 --> 00:50:45,625
on Facebook and YouTube about?

1477
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,041
- What is everyone's
favorite ice cream?

1478
00:50:50,041 --> 00:50:50,875
- Nice.

1479
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:52,291
- That works with what
we've already talked about.

1480
00:50:52,291 --> 00:50:53,500
I like it.
- My man.

1481
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,083
Thank you for being on the show.
- Yes.

1482
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:56,125
- Thanks for having us.
- And you my man.

1483
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:57,000
- Thanks you so much.
- You're awesome.

1484
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:57,500
- Thanks for your advice.

1485
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,542
- You keep asking questions,
we'll keep answering them.

1486
00:51:00,542 --> 00:00:00,000
(hip hop music)
