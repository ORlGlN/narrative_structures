1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:02,371
- Wednesday.

2
00:00:02,371 --> 00:00:03,538
Patience baby!

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,928
You don't build the
biggest building in town

4
00:00:07,928 --> 00:00:10,228
by trying to rush into things.

5
00:00:10,228 --> 00:00:11,912
I'm just watching so
many people make so many

6
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:15,823
short-term decisions 'cause of patience.

7
00:00:15,823 --> 00:00:20,093
Patience is absolutely the
foundation for so many people.

8
00:00:20,093 --> 00:00:22,752
And happiness and
relationships and business.

9
00:00:22,752 --> 00:00:26,578
If there's anything that
I could wish on people,

10
00:00:26,578 --> 00:00:30,602
it's for them to understand
that you have more time

11
00:00:30,602 --> 00:00:34,769
at a macro, and you need
to go faster in the micro.

12
00:00:35,894 --> 00:00:39,874
Day in and day out faster,
year in, year out, slower.

13
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:42,791
(slow piano music)

14
00:00:52,646 --> 00:00:55,985
Andy and I are adding people
to Team Gary Vee around running

15
00:00:55,985 --> 00:00:58,821
some of these Instagram
media accounts that we own.

16
00:00:58,821 --> 00:01:01,457
And so, content creation and growth.

17
00:01:01,457 --> 00:01:02,957
Swipe up to apply.

18
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:11,192
- So the book, I'd love some advice.

19
00:01:11,192 --> 00:01:12,985
- [Gary] When's it coming out?

20
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:14,965
- So, you'll tell me
whether this is a good idea.

21
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:16,494
- You know what I admire about you?

22
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:21,204
You really, really know
how to hold your breath.

23
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:22,212
- [Scott] What do you mean by that?

24
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:24,981
- I think the thing
that really makes me me,

25
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:27,743
when I talk to myself about
myself to myself, that makes

26
00:01:27,743 --> 00:01:31,910
me the most happy, is I am
able to be a good person

27
00:01:33,724 --> 00:01:35,660
'cause I'm good at holding my breath.

28
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,357
When you're talented, you can give.

29
00:01:38,357 --> 00:01:41,486
- So, 19 minute video, so
everybody said no one's

30
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:42,591
gonna watch a 19 minute video.

31
00:01:42,591 --> 00:01:43,635
- [Gary] Everybody watches 19 minute--

32
00:01:43,635 --> 00:01:45,341
- So a lot of people watched it.

33
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:47,614
I was in Uganda two months
ago, and I got an email

34
00:01:47,614 --> 00:01:51,893
that a 93-year-old man
in a retirement community

35
00:01:51,893 --> 00:01:55,187
in Austin watched the video
and he called the office

36
00:01:55,187 --> 00:01:58,417
and gave half a million dollars.

37
00:01:58,417 --> 00:01:59,571
We want the story to be out there.

38
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:00,480
- [Gary] That's exactly
what's gonna happen.

39
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,788
- You never know who it
moves, you never know.

40
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,665
It's like seeds.

41
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:03,989
- My friend, there's a big
difference between building

42
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:05,483
a brand and selling.

43
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:07,204
- Well, I'm just telling the story.

44
00:02:07,204 --> 00:02:08,037
Right?

45
00:02:08,037 --> 00:02:08,905
- [Gary] You're building a brand.

46
00:02:08,905 --> 00:02:11,326
Like, you know, of course
you're selling on a micro,

47
00:02:11,326 --> 00:02:13,029
you're branding on a macro.

48
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:14,286
That's what I do.

49
00:02:14,286 --> 00:02:15,574
I have an idea.

50
00:02:15,574 --> 00:02:17,241
- [Scott] All right.

51
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,999
- And I think this is fuckin' brilliant.

52
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:24,781
And I think you can pull it off.

53
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:27,781
My man, I think you can pull it off.

54
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,247
Look, the thing that you've
done remarkably well is brand.

55
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,229
There's something here.

56
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:42,538
- Our hack event starts tomorrow, so--

57
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:43,788
- This is real.

58
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:46,842
- It's an interesting idea.

59
00:02:46,842 --> 00:02:48,019
- I knew you'd love it.

60
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:48,904
I'm pumped!

61
00:02:48,904 --> 00:02:49,832
- Thanks, dude.

62
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:52,009
(knuckles rapping)

63
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:54,197
- If this actually
happens, I want it to be

64
00:02:54,197 --> 00:02:55,130
in the museum one day.

65
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,336
- Um.

66
00:02:56,336 --> 00:02:58,919
This may actually surprise you.

67
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:06,451
- How are you, my man?

68
00:03:06,451 --> 00:03:07,284
- Fine.

69
00:03:07,284 --> 00:03:08,273
- 1% battery life.
- 1%.

70
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:10,150
- Did you shit when I just emailed you?

71
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,983
- I shit.

72
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:11,825
No, I didn't even read
it, to be honest with you,

73
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,673
I was with my team.
- Thank god, thank god.

74
00:03:13,673 --> 00:03:15,671
'Cause I thought it was a
phone call, and I was like

75
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:16,586
fuck, we missed it, we'll
have to reschedule it.

76
00:03:16,586 --> 00:03:18,958
And then Tyler comes and
goes, "Dude, the guy's here."

77
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,001
I'm like, "Oh, thank god."

78
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:21,511
- I told him last time, I woulda came.

79
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:22,780
Listen, I got some cannolis from Brooklyn.

80
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,860
- I love it, actually, you know what?

81
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,767
I'm not supposed to eat
this shit, but cannolis

82
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:25,600
from Brooklyn I'm supposed to.
- I didn't know if it was

83
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,504
a cheat day, but I want--

84
00:03:26,504 --> 00:03:27,456
- No, no, no.

85
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:28,517
I'm gonna make it one.

86
00:03:28,517 --> 00:03:29,555
Cannolis are like, sorry Jordan.

87
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:31,733
- So listen, these are the special things.

88
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:32,857
These are called empanollis.

89
00:03:32,857 --> 00:03:35,580
It's like, imagine an
empanada crust with some sugar

90
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,593
and the best kinda like ricotta cheese.

91
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:38,886
It's an Italian thing.

92
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:39,963
- Oh, I know what this thing is.

93
00:03:39,963 --> 00:03:40,946
This fuckin' thing is the best.

94
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:42,217
- [Chris] The best bakery in Brooklyn.

95
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:43,794
And I gotcha some stuff.

96
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:44,912
- Thank you, brother.

97
00:03:44,912 --> 00:03:45,843
- [Chris] You're welcome.

98
00:03:45,843 --> 00:03:47,045
Yeah, it's the shit.

99
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:47,972
- Yeah.

100
00:03:47,972 --> 00:03:49,421
- [Chris] That's the
fuckin' shit right there.

101
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:50,616
- It's so good.

102
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:51,459
Oh, my god!

103
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:52,404
Hey!

104
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:54,044
(shouting)

105
00:03:54,044 --> 00:03:55,094
- [Chris] Party foul!

106
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:56,286
- Who wants to die?

107
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:57,496
- [Woman] What is that?

108
00:03:57,496 --> 00:03:58,613
- Share this.

109
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,104
- [Woman] It looks good.

110
00:04:00,104 --> 00:04:03,295
- Does anybody wanna die out of happiness?

111
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:04,128
This is so fucking good--

112
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:05,083
- [Woman] Canollis in there.

113
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,789
(laughing)

114
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:07,671
What is it?

115
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:08,749
- I have to bite it again.

116
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,621
- [Woman] Does it have cream in it?

117
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:12,871
(mumbling)

118
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:15,451
- Thanks, thank you.

119
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:17,897
(rustling)

120
00:04:17,897 --> 00:04:19,329
(mumbling)

121
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:22,685
- That always happens with the cream shit.

122
00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:23,942
Good job, Ty.

123
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:24,819
- [Ty] Geez, that was fuckin' good.

124
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:25,652
(speakers drowning each other out)

125
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:26,485
- Can you take this, I'm good.

126
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:27,427
Cool.

127
00:04:27,427 --> 00:04:28,349
How are you, my friend?

128
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:30,627
- [Chris] Thank you, so much
for seeing me, that was--

129
00:04:30,627 --> 00:04:31,631
- Of course, man, you won!

130
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:32,843
- [Chris] I feel bad about that.

131
00:04:32,843 --> 00:04:33,829
- 60 Second Club.

132
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:34,662
Why do you feel bad?

133
00:04:34,662 --> 00:04:35,565
All right, take these out to everybody.

134
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:37,099
1% battery life--

135
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:38,824
- [Chris] You're busy,
you know what I mean?

136
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:39,832
- No worries.

137
00:04:39,832 --> 00:04:41,356
- [Chris] So, yeah,
listen, I want to just,

138
00:04:41,356 --> 00:04:42,477
to be honest with you--

139
00:04:42,477 --> 00:04:45,060
- Yeah, tell me about yourself.

140
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:49,080
- I've been the type of
person my whole life that

141
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,146
I never realized that I have
entrepreneurial tendencies,

142
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:56,821
and I've done things my
entire life that are really--

143
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:58,883
- Are you the dude that was on a TV show?

144
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:00,252
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I remember now.

145
00:05:00,252 --> 00:05:02,610
- I did a few TV shows, I went to college,

146
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,457
you know what I'm saying?

147
00:05:03,457 --> 00:05:06,407
My parents, my father's a
fire fighter, they always

148
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:07,992
kinda raised me like Brooklyn--

149
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:09,101
- [Gary] Yeah, I know it, I know it.

150
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,699
- Go to college, gotta go get
a city job, get a union job.

151
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:12,689
- [Gary] Yep, mm-hmm.

152
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:14,729
- That wasn't who I was, but
I listened like a knucklehead.

153
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:15,815
- [Gary] No, like everybody does.

154
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,973
I get it.

155
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:18,670
- So, I'm in high school going--

156
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,684
- [Gary] How old are you now?

157
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:20,595
- I'm 28.

158
00:05:20,595 --> 00:05:21,449
- [Gary] Love it, so much time.

159
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:23,439
- But when I was in
high school, I used to,

160
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,025
I was on My Super Sweet 16
when I was 16 years old.

161
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:30,491
I used to be a dancer and
an MC for VJ companies.

162
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:31,951
I was always in the spotlight,
I started my own business

163
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:34,520
back then, but I never
looked at it as being

164
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,718
a business man, I was
trying to make some money.

165
00:05:36,718 --> 00:05:37,766
- [Gary] Yeah, of course.

166
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:40,798
- So, I used to sell white
Uptowns, and $5.00 reports

167
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,797
in high school.

168
00:05:41,797 --> 00:05:42,711
I always had these--

169
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:43,544
- [Gary] You were hustling.

170
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:44,791
- Sales skills, but I never
thought of myself as that.

171
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,444
So, I knew I wanted to be something big.

172
00:05:47,444 --> 00:05:48,936
Graduated college.

173
00:05:48,936 --> 00:05:50,426
Gotta be honest with you.

174
00:05:50,426 --> 00:05:54,384
I applied for the Jersey
Shore before it came out.

175
00:05:54,384 --> 00:05:55,991
I was finalist.

176
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:57,588
Vinny won over me.

177
00:05:57,588 --> 00:05:59,052
So, after that I was--

178
00:05:59,052 --> 00:06:00,209
- That's devastating.

179
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:01,276
(laughing)

180
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:02,448
- And we didn't know what the show was.

181
00:06:02,448 --> 00:06:03,455
I didn't know what the show was--

182
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:05,347
- When that show exploded,
you were like fuck me.

183
00:06:05,347 --> 00:06:07,533
- (mumbling) I'm going to
make it somehow, someway.

184
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,815
- [Gary] 'Cause you were so pissed, right?

185
00:06:09,815 --> 00:06:10,956
- I was like fuck.

186
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:13,191
So, I sign up on all these
shows, and I got on a show.

187
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:14,575
It was called The Choice.

188
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,424
It was to see if a regular guy
from the streets could make

189
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:18,695
a celebrity fall for them.

190
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:21,976
So, I went onstage in front
of 1,000 people in CBS Studios

191
00:06:21,976 --> 00:06:24,225
in Hollywood, I had 30
seconds to spit game.

192
00:06:24,225 --> 00:06:25,513
And it was like The Voice.

193
00:06:25,513 --> 00:06:26,360
- [Gary] I love it.

194
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,355
- Right?

195
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:28,810
So, all the chairs, it was
Miss America, it was Playmate

196
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,065
of the Year, it was
Sofie Monk, an actress,

197
00:06:32,065 --> 00:06:32,968
and Carmen Electra.

198
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:33,886
- [Gary] I love it, I love it.

199
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:35,193
- There was fuckin' doctors
and lawyers, Marines--

200
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:36,182
- [Gary] What did you say?

201
00:06:36,182 --> 00:06:37,820
- They were like say this.

202
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,844
I was like--

203
00:06:38,844 --> 00:06:40,268
- [Gary] I'm gonna say my thing.

204
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:41,782
- I don't need help, I'm gettin' this.

205
00:06:41,782 --> 00:06:42,636
- [Gary] Yeah, right.

206
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:43,671
- One thing you can't tell me about--

207
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:44,902
- [Gary] This is the
one thing I'm good at!

208
00:06:44,902 --> 00:06:46,363
- This is the one thing
I'm good with (mumbling),

209
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:47,487
I was like let me do what I gotta do.

210
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:48,446
I went out there, I said four words.

211
00:06:48,446 --> 00:06:49,425
I was, "Yous all gorgeous."

212
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:50,800
Ding, ding, ding.

213
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,667
They all picked me.

214
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:53,625
I won the show in 30 seconds.

215
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,844
I got Carmen Electra.

216
00:06:54,844 --> 00:06:56,156
- I love it!

217
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:57,254
That's amazing.

218
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,777
- So, I'm just sittin'
there now, I'm like, yo,

219
00:06:59,777 --> 00:07:00,871
they weren't kidding.

220
00:07:00,871 --> 00:07:02,726
They were like after you
do the show, it's a high--

221
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:03,883
- [Gary] And then a low, yeah.

222
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:08,009
- So, I have a St. John's degree
for Hospitality Management

223
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:09,957
'cause when I was in college,
I was like, "I don't like

224
00:07:09,957 --> 00:07:10,988
"math, I don't like science.

225
00:07:10,988 --> 00:07:12,436
"I'm a people guy."

226
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:14,546
I was a salesman, I didn't know.

227
00:07:14,546 --> 00:07:15,598
- [Gary] I totally understand.

228
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:17,526
- [Man] Sorry, I was gonna roll.

229
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:18,359
Do you want to say a quick word--

230
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:19,192
- [Gary] I do, give me two seconds.

231
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:20,025
- Sure.

232
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:22,341
- My man, I'm gonna throw
you in the car with me

233
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,706
'cause I have to go to Yankee Stadium.

234
00:07:23,706 --> 00:07:24,749
Not right now.

235
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:25,761
When am I leaving?

236
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:27,184
- [Man] You can leave in 25.

237
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:28,057
- Okay.

238
00:07:28,057 --> 00:07:30,113
So, let's do the call right
now, the eBay thing, cool.

239
00:07:30,113 --> 00:07:30,946
- [Chris] Switch it out?

240
00:07:30,946 --> 00:07:31,779
- Yeah.

241
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:33,317
And then we'll hang for like
10, 15 minute, I'll drop

242
00:07:33,317 --> 00:07:34,417
you off in the Bronx.

243
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:35,698
Hello, how are you?

244
00:07:35,698 --> 00:07:38,372
(slow electronic music)

245
00:07:38,372 --> 00:07:40,006
I'm super smart, like super smart.

246
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:41,558
Iris.

247
00:07:41,558 --> 00:07:43,221
- [Man On Phone] One way
for you to think about is--

248
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:44,447
- I'm on this kick lately,
I'm startin' to realize,

249
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:46,224
I'm really smart, right?

250
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:47,457
Like super?

251
00:07:47,457 --> 00:07:48,290
(laughing)

252
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,450
- [Man On Phone] Dedicated
to the team and talk.

253
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,415
And then there's a small--

254
00:07:50,415 --> 00:07:51,813
- Hi YouTube.

255
00:07:51,813 --> 00:07:53,212
♫ Made it all

256
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:55,826
♫ Don't strain

257
00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:59,437
♫ My cause you God all say the same thing

258
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,534
♫ Oh

259
00:08:01,534 --> 00:08:03,282
♫ Don't strain

260
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,778
- The problem is I think it's
a feature, not a platform.

261
00:08:04,778 --> 00:08:06,509
- It's a feature.

262
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:08,902
Right, so you think Facebook
or something like that can--

263
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:10,083
- Of course.

264
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:13,335
You are so gifted in
emotional intelligence

265
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:14,269
and people skills.

266
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:15,263
- Me?

267
00:08:15,263 --> 00:08:17,618
- And you're deploying
it against a technology

268
00:08:17,618 --> 00:08:19,814
and operations business.

269
00:08:19,814 --> 00:08:23,544
My intuition, not best use of time.

270
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,491
You're makin' a mistake.

271
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:26,333
You're makin' a mistake.

272
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,674
Let me tell you what
mistake you're making.

273
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:31,021
You're letting other people do it for you.

274
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:33,046
I'm doing it for myself.

275
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,285
- Right, of course.

276
00:08:34,285 --> 00:08:37,483
- If I was as good looking
as you, I'd have 11 million

277
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:38,626
fucking followers.

278
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:39,698
You're not listening.

279
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:40,761
- No, do it myself.

280
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:42,173
- You're not listening.

281
00:08:42,174 --> 00:08:43,264
- I hear you.

282
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:44,162
No, you're right.

283
00:08:44,162 --> 00:08:44,995
Do it myself.
- I know I'm right.

284
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:46,377
- I know, that's why--

285
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:47,935
- You're deploying your
energy against something

286
00:08:47,935 --> 00:08:49,968
that has no shot of
winning, in my opinion.

287
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:50,961
None.

288
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:52,999
And I know like the truck,
and like, it's not fun

289
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,036
for me to say that.

290
00:08:54,036 --> 00:08:54,935
By the way, I could be wrong.

291
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:55,896
I've been wrong before.

292
00:08:55,896 --> 00:08:57,130
Let's keep everything,
I'm not a fuckin' genie.

293
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,666
- Of course.

294
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,323
- But, my intuition is
we are now in the era

295
00:09:01,323 --> 00:09:04,241
where guys like you don't
have to be at the mercy

296
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:06,269
of MTV, it's the golden era of that.

297
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:08,019
- I can do it myself.

298
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:14,324
- And you're doing two things wrong.

299
00:09:14,324 --> 00:09:16,313
First, you're deploying
your magic against something

300
00:09:16,313 --> 00:09:18,333
that you shouldn't, and then number two,

301
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,006
in the place where you have
the magic, you're trying

302
00:09:21,006 --> 00:09:23,914
to let somebody else control your outcome.

303
00:09:23,914 --> 00:09:27,865
Because what you have is
not something can be bought.

304
00:09:27,865 --> 00:09:29,058
- Bought.

305
00:09:29,058 --> 00:09:30,892
- What you need to do
is you need to bring all

306
00:09:30,892 --> 00:09:32,901
that energy, and you need to do this.

307
00:09:32,901 --> 00:09:36,736
You should become a reality
TV star on Facebook,

308
00:09:36,736 --> 00:09:39,182
Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube.

309
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:40,515
You should vlog.

310
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:42,994
Your life.

311
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:44,806
Your dating life, your homie's life,

312
00:09:44,806 --> 00:09:47,953
your basketball life, your
fuckin' buying new sneakers life.

313
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:50,496
You personally will make
over a million dollars

314
00:09:50,496 --> 00:09:52,146
a year being you.

315
00:09:52,146 --> 00:09:56,313
♫ Ain't that what they always say

316
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:03,762
♫ Wait

317
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:05,611
♫ They don't love you like I love you

318
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:07,062
♫ Wait

319
00:10:07,062 --> 00:10:09,309
♫ Oh, they don't love you like I love you

320
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,892
♫ That's right

321
00:10:15,924 --> 00:10:18,330
♫ They don't love you like I love you

322
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,163
- I'm doing the best thing ever.

323
00:10:19,163 --> 00:10:21,010
I have so many sneakers here,
that I'm wearing sneakers

324
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,249
from my closet that I don't
want anymore, that I give

325
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:25,557
away to random people, and
then I put on the new ones.

326
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:26,631
Amazing.

327
00:10:26,631 --> 00:10:28,700
- [Man] I don't have anything
locked in, right now.

328
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,203
- What are they 10 1/2?

329
00:10:31,203 --> 00:10:32,786
Anybody want boots?

330
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:34,596
- [Colin] I'm takin' 'em.

331
00:10:34,596 --> 00:10:36,026
- 10 1/2, all right, 10 1/2 Colin?

332
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:36,859
- [Colin] Yeah.

333
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:38,526
- 10 1/2?

334
00:10:40,035 --> 00:10:42,452
(chattering)

335
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:48,862
Everybody's a 10 1/2!

336
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:49,999
Oh, you know, dude?

337
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:52,175
Are you outta your mind?

338
00:10:52,175 --> 00:10:54,419
I'm not supposed to do any
Red Eyes, now you want me

339
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:55,689
to do Red Eye connectors?

340
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,297
We've digressed.

341
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:00,630
(slow electronic music)

342
00:11:08,997 --> 00:11:09,964
- [Don] Gary!

343
00:11:09,964 --> 00:11:11,531
Finally.

344
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:12,364
- Real pleasure.

345
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:14,020
- You talk a lot about hustle,
you talk a lot about drive.

346
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,578
The number one thing
that we see a lot of is

347
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:18,617
that a lot of students don't
know what to hustle on.

348
00:11:18,617 --> 00:11:21,020
They're swiping on their
phones, their attention is

349
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,750
somewhere else, and there
seems to be this misnomer

350
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,018
that as long as I get a
really good SAT score,

351
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,192
I'll go to that college of
my choice, and then once

352
00:11:28,192 --> 00:11:30,111
I go to the college of my
choice, everything will be okay.

353
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:31,094
- Yeah.

354
00:11:31,094 --> 00:11:32,427
It's a misnomer.

355
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:37,880
Misnomers and stereotypes and
things like that are grounded

356
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,077
in truths; there was a
time and day and age.

357
00:11:40,077 --> 00:11:44,071
There was no conversation when
we went through K through 12

358
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:47,451
where there was any outlet
other than the variable

359
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:50,181
of your success was gonna be
predicated on what college

360
00:11:50,181 --> 00:11:51,173
you went to.

361
00:11:51,173 --> 00:11:52,912
I was making real money.

362
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,869
Like real money.

363
00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:58,871
I was making 1,000,
2,000, $3,000 a weekend

364
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:02,431
as a 12, 13, 14, 15 year
old, and there was nobody

365
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,533
in my life, outside of my
parents, who deemed that

366
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:08,828
as a proxy or a preview to success.

367
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,262
That is insane.

368
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,584
- So, let's just say that if we're all

369
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:15,020
just virtually watching
your blogs, and that's just

370
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,318
a part of class, once
again, the hard part is

371
00:12:17,318 --> 00:12:18,456
the collaboration and the work.

372
00:12:18,456 --> 00:12:20,611
So, I don't necessarily
think that we're all going

373
00:12:20,611 --> 00:12:23,250
to stay at home and watch video tutorials.

374
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,423
I don't think that's powerful.

375
00:12:24,423 --> 00:12:25,783
I think getting together is powerful.

376
00:12:25,783 --> 00:12:30,627
However, if Gary were to
transform a, let's just go

377
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:32,690
with middle school or high
school, what is the first

378
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,797
thing you start with?

379
00:12:33,797 --> 00:12:38,615
- Well, I think, the first
thing I start with is,

380
00:12:38,615 --> 00:12:40,678
it's funny how many different
places my brain went.

381
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:42,628
One of the places my brain
went is first I gotta get

382
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,081
people to send their kids there.

383
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:46,179
So, it's about the marketing
of what the fuck I'm up to.

384
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:47,342
Right?

385
00:12:47,342 --> 00:12:49,437
But if you're saying that's
all done, and you're talking

386
00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:51,246
more about the curriculum
or the execution or what are

387
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:54,043
we actually doing there,
the first thing we do is

388
00:12:54,043 --> 00:12:57,634
we memorize zero
information ever, forever.

389
00:12:57,634 --> 00:12:59,805
It's rule number one of the bill of rights

390
00:12:59,805 --> 00:13:00,697
of my school.

391
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:04,381
Zero, zero memorization of information.

392
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:05,543
Information's commoditized.

393
00:13:05,543 --> 00:13:07,375
It's at the fingertips
of every single person.

394
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:10,956
Memorizing or knowing any
information is dick shit.

395
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,118
It's out.

396
00:13:12,118 --> 00:13:13,140
It's outlawed.

397
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,315
It is not valued.

398
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:15,710
And we do not score on it.

399
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,097
I think the first thing, I'd
build an entrepreneur school,

400
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:22,160
and so the first class
and the first day is

401
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,334
all about selling.

402
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:28,029
I believe selling is the
seed, in a lot of ways,

403
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:29,115
of entrepreneurship.

404
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:33,939
I feel like not everybody's
a, so I sell, but I sell

405
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,734
by building brand and
letting people come to me.

406
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:36,769
- Right.

407
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:38,284
- I hate asking somebody to buy something.

408
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,147
I don't like the feeling
of not having the leverage.

409
00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:44,120
So, I think the first
thing would be teaching

410
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,019
a selling class.

411
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,324
So, probably the first day
of school, given my narrative

412
00:13:48,324 --> 00:13:51,960
in my career, would be Lemonade
101, and everybody would

413
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,494
kinda walk in, and depending
on if it was a middle school,

414
00:13:54,494 --> 00:13:56,978
I would still call it Lemonade,
but what we'd probably do

415
00:13:56,978 --> 00:13:59,055
is we would buy and sell something.

416
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:03,199
Most likely, we go, so,
my curriculum would change

417
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,164
every year, my concepts
would change every year,

418
00:14:05,164 --> 00:14:07,417
but it would be a 100%
doing organization, right?

419
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:10,500
We would teach something on
Monday, and we would do it,

420
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,294
literally, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday.

421
00:14:13,294 --> 00:14:15,318
And then some version of that.

422
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:17,315
I don't know if that goes
another week, or if every Monday,

423
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:18,697
I'm willing to teach something.

424
00:14:18,697 --> 00:14:21,708
But four out of five days is
doing, and so day number one,

425
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:25,875
today, if it started
tomorrow, is retail arbitrage.

426
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:30,833
I believe every single person
listening to this can make

427
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:35,089
$100,000 a year, $100,000
a year, and have very good

428
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:38,485
work, life balance, by
buying stuff in one place,

429
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:41,554
and selling it on the
Internet somewhere else.

430
00:14:41,554 --> 00:14:43,112
- [Don] One piece of
advise to that 17 year old,

431
00:14:43,112 --> 00:14:45,258
who is really thinking
either about a gap year,

432
00:14:45,258 --> 00:14:46,923
college, or not.

433
00:14:46,923 --> 00:14:51,447
- So, as far as the 17 year
old, look, I think one thing

434
00:14:51,447 --> 00:14:54,630
you should know is you have a
very long life ahead of you.

435
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,162
It's crazy to me how
the human brain works.

436
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,461
You never have patience.

437
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:03,323
At 17, you feel like,
anybody who's 41 to 45 knows

438
00:15:03,323 --> 00:15:07,490
that how they felt at 17, you
felt, I mean, when we were 21,

439
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:10,887
a 41 year old was almost dead.

440
00:15:10,887 --> 00:15:13,442
The oldest shit of all time.

441
00:15:13,442 --> 00:15:15,566
And now, we feel like we're 21, still.

442
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,061
In our brains.

443
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:19,284
We don't look it, in the
wrinkle, we got the wrinkles now.

444
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:22,267
So, I think the biggest thing
I would tell a 17 year old is

445
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:25,546
you have so much time,
it's actually laughable.

446
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:29,601
So, make a decision, whether
gap year of college or not,

447
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:32,249
completely predicated
on realizing that your

448
00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:35,828
life is so long, you have so much time.

449
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:39,100
You can probably make nothing
but mistakes for the next

450
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,797
13 years of your life,
and probably still have

451
00:15:41,797 --> 00:15:45,176
a tremendously happy life,
and once you wrap your head

452
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:47,719
around that, it probably
empowers you to make the best

453
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:49,151
decision for yourself.

454
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:50,329
(knuckles rapping)

455
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:51,370
- [Don] 'Preciate you
being a new age teacher.

456
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,283
- Thank you, brother.
- Show an example.

457
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:53,604
- Thank you.

458
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:56,937
(slow electronic music)

459
00:15:58,353 --> 00:15:59,794
Thank you, so much.

460
00:15:59,794 --> 00:16:00,638
Love you.

461
00:16:00,638 --> 00:16:01,471
See ya.

462
00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:02,304
Take care.

463
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,343
It's 10:01 p.m., I'm
going to a dinner meeting.

464
00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:07,545
Iris wanted me to say
something before I went

465
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:08,809
to my dinner meeting.

466
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:09,789
There you go, Iris.

467
00:16:09,789 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Iris] Thank you.
