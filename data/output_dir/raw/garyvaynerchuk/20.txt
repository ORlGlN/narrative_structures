1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,030
- It was the craziest moment of my life.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,237
I sat there on the phone and...

3
00:00:06,237 --> 00:00:09,570
(heavy electronic beat)

4
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:15,543
(soft keyboard music)

5
00:00:15,543 --> 00:00:18,386
I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

6
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:20,136
I'm good at patterns.

7
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:24,811
The same way that when I was an influencer

8
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:28,419
on Twitter and YouTube in
2006, there was no money,

9
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:31,333
but now Logan Paul can
make $40 million in a year,

10
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,808
that's what's gonna happen.

11
00:00:32,808 --> 00:00:35,221
Netflix treated it like a movie

12
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:37,501
the way movies open in theatrical.

13
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:39,024
They get a movie, put it on Netflix

14
00:00:39,024 --> 00:00:41,474
and then they spent money on television

15
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:43,461
and outdoor and all that.

16
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:46,118
Then all the kids - the King
Bach's, the Logans, all them -

17
00:00:46,118 --> 00:00:47,898
they thought they could
make movies like this.

18
00:00:47,898 --> 00:00:49,775
They made direct to iTunes and this,

19
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:51,982
and those didn't work either, right?

20
00:00:51,982 --> 00:00:53,176
Same old shit.

21
00:00:53,176 --> 00:00:57,370
It's just the same reason that
Tila Tequila and Dane Cook

22
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,771
used Myspace, got theirs,
but it's not the same level

23
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:04,465
of what the economics are now
for somebody that really wins.

24
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:07,485
Fat Jewish makes a lot more
money than Tila Tequila

25
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:10,373
even though it was the
same game 10 years apart.

26
00:01:10,373 --> 00:01:11,848
The best thing I could do for you

27
00:01:11,848 --> 00:01:13,701
from a pay it forward standpoint

28
00:01:13,701 --> 00:01:15,592
is tell you why not to settle into your...

29
00:01:15,592 --> 00:01:17,367
I do it and that's why I'm starting

30
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:18,537
to get better at my career.

31
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,320
- Settle into what you...

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,153
Know what you know.

33
00:01:21,153 --> 00:01:23,739
- Get educated on how much
the world is your oyster.

34
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:26,629
Fame is the ultimate
arbitrage in our society.

35
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:28,046
My entire career,

36
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:31,771
and I'm not joking,

37
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:35,014
is predicated on what I learned
in selling baseball cards.

38
00:01:35,014 --> 00:01:36,331
I'm not joking.

39
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:39,671
This entire company and all it's success

40
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:41,587
literally points back to baseball cards.

41
00:01:41,587 --> 00:01:42,534
- [Arthur] Where are my royalties?

42
00:01:42,534 --> 00:01:46,349
- Well how much do I owe you?
- Well, that's okay.

43
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:49,372
- It was the craziest moment of my life.

44
00:01:49,372 --> 00:01:51,944
I sat there on the phone,
and you know how your brain

45
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:53,210
can go really fast sometimes?

46
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,478
- [Arthur] Yes, I do.

47
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:56,197
- And I was in an
interesting point of my life

48
00:01:56,197 --> 00:01:58,110
because I invested in Facebook early on

49
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,853
so this was a realistic conversation.

50
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:01,865
And it ran through my mind of,

51
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:05,198
"My God, I came to this fucking country.

52
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:10,680
"I barely bought my
first pack of '83 Topps.

53
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,996
"Could barely buy a pack,
and I'm on a conversation

54
00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:16,507
"right now to buy the whole fuckin' thing?

55
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:18,180
"This is the craziest shit ever."

56
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,496
- [Arthur] It's super iconic.

57
00:02:19,496 --> 00:02:20,459
- [Gary] Ryan, two seconds.

58
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,209
Come here. Come here.

59
00:02:24,238 --> 00:02:26,676
You are not going to
believe who this man is.

60
00:02:26,676 --> 00:02:28,919
- Don't look at me.

61
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,150
- You're not gonna believe this.

62
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,881
- Arthur Shorin.
- Ryan Schinman.

63
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:35,453
- [Gary] Ryan, when we first met...

64
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:38,086
Mark's the real star. He's
building a huge fuckin' business.

65
00:02:38,086 --> 00:02:40,535
Ryan's just stepped in his shit.

66
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:45,436
Ryan, when we first met,
what was the common interest?

67
00:02:45,436 --> 00:02:47,179
- Basketball cards and baseball cards.

68
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:50,762
- Guess what his father
and uncles founded?

69
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:53,416
- Not Topps?
- Yeah, sure.

70
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,541
- [Gary] Can you fuckin' believe this?

71
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,552
(laughs)

72
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:59,258
- You wanna know what I
brought him as a present today?

73
00:02:59,258 --> 00:03:01,654
So I just bought into a huge...

74
00:03:01,654 --> 00:03:02,796
- Is this the craziest?

75
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:03,770
- I have a company called Goldin Auctions

76
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,152
now with Ken Goldin so I
bought into that company,

77
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,674
and I actually brought
Gary the new catalog.

78
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:09,507
- Thank you.
- Wait.

79
00:03:09,507 --> 00:03:12,109
- And then I bought him,
you'll laugh, this today.

80
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,608
- Oh my God.
- Whad'ya know.

81
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:17,097
- I just gave him a, ya know.

82
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,850
Since that was a present.

83
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,683
- [Arthur] Tell Kenny I say hello.

84
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:23,332
- [Ryan] I will. You wanna know
what was very interesting...

85
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:25,999
- Piernoff's a good dude.
- Yeah.

86
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:31,698
(emotional string music)

87
00:03:31,698 --> 00:03:33,531
I could sell anything.

88
00:03:35,227 --> 00:03:38,811
I can sell everything, anything,
any time, always, forever.

89
00:03:38,811 --> 00:03:41,298
Vlog, I promise I'll start
talking more about sales.

90
00:03:41,298 --> 00:03:44,715
(photo shutter snapping)

91
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:49,289
(ethereal music)

92
00:03:56,925 --> 00:03:59,546
It's interesting. Here's what I would say.

93
00:03:59,546 --> 00:04:01,789
First you have to know
what your finish line is.

94
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:04,861
I would actually say knowing
what your finish line is

95
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:07,072
is the most important part.

96
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:08,321
Like, I really mean that.

97
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:10,003
When I think about business in general...

98
00:04:10,003 --> 00:04:12,709
So for example, if your
goal is to sell this

99
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:15,206
to (redacted) because you
guys are both at a point

100
00:04:15,206 --> 00:04:17,925
in your lives - you're still
young - where you want this

101
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,069
to be the, and I don't know
enough about your business,

102
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:22,398
but this to be the holy fuck

103
00:04:22,398 --> 00:04:24,507
(redacted)-million dollars each off the...

104
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:27,091
Well, then you have to know that

105
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:30,689
and then I would say everything
has to stem from that.

106
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:34,623
I think the difference
is the fucking execution,

107
00:04:34,623 --> 00:04:39,364
but I would hire somebody
who has sold a brand.

108
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:41,448
I would pay somebody (redacted)

109
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,228
with the current state of the union.

110
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:49,091
Meaning whoever just bought
(redacted), so they're out.

111
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:52,090
They just bought (redacted).
They're not gonna buy it.

112
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,747
Here's (redacted) situation.
Here's (redacted).

113
00:04:54,747 --> 00:04:57,137
Here's (redacted).
Here's an emerging thing.

114
00:04:57,137 --> 00:04:58,783
Here's these two guys who broke off

115
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:00,483
and got a billion in funding,

116
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:03,243
and you literally fuckin'
reverse engineered them.

117
00:05:03,243 --> 00:05:05,559
I think the best piece of
advice I could give you

118
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:07,887
was my opening line
which is, "Okay, cool".

119
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:09,399
The other line I would tell you is

120
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,874
how big is your ambition to sell.

121
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:12,946
The one thing you guys
have to with each other,

122
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:17,028
the most important part, is
tell the truth to each other.

123
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:19,138
What would get you off the table?

124
00:05:19,138 --> 00:05:21,723
And you should do it on the
first day of January every year

125
00:05:21,723 --> 00:05:23,941
or Christmas or when you
do your end of the year.

126
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:25,428
If you're aligned on that you could

127
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:27,586
create incredible business opportunities.

128
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:29,439
- Could I just interject
here for a second?

129
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,471
I want you to see...

130
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:32,678
- Oh my God. Who's that?

131
00:05:32,678 --> 00:05:34,006
- That's my 13 year old daughter.

132
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:35,896
- 13?
- My 13 year old daughter.

133
00:05:35,896 --> 00:05:37,688
- That's amazing. 'a-va' or 'ah-va'?

134
00:05:37,688 --> 00:05:38,521
- 'A-va'.

135
00:05:40,403 --> 00:05:42,069
- 13?
- 13.

136
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:44,032
- I've been telling you
man, what I've been doing.

137
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:46,287
I'll explain to you why
that happened real quick.

138
00:05:46,287 --> 00:05:47,204
Ava, right?

139
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:50,493
Ava, what's up? It's Gary Vee.

140
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:52,224
I'm hangin' out with your pops.

141
00:05:52,224 --> 00:05:54,126
But I'm telling him that we should

142
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:56,454
hang out one day so I can't wait for that.

143
00:05:56,454 --> 00:05:58,612
Keep doin' your thing.
Thank you for watching.

144
00:05:58,612 --> 00:06:02,964
I hope you have a great
night. See you soon.

145
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:04,390
(laughs)

146
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:08,955
- You do realize that she has
to go to bed tonight, right?

147
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:11,446
- By the way based on what I
heard on the philanthropy kick,

148
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:13,104
I'll actually go here first.

149
00:06:13,104 --> 00:06:16,920
I never start with this because
this is super altruistic,

150
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,662
but what I am up to right
now, and Iris will tell you,

151
00:06:21,662 --> 00:06:23,381
literally, and this is so audacious.

152
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:27,464
I'm basically taking 13,
15, 17, 18 year old boys

153
00:06:29,318 --> 00:06:33,151
and basically winning
the cool game with them.

154
00:06:34,267 --> 00:06:36,570
And I mean number one. Above Curry.

155
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,148
Above, like, winning. Their number one.

156
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,216
Because entrepreneurship has been put

157
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:42,007
on such an extreme pedestal.

158
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:44,884
Killy, this hot rapper in
Toronto who I'm friends with,

159
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:47,867
I basically am in a crazy place.

160
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:49,598
And one that you couldn't imagine.

161
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:51,719
Stick with me. 13 to 18.

162
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:56,719
Not what you see. What he has
some indication to clearly.

163
00:06:56,925 --> 00:06:59,326
But here's where it gets really good.

164
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:03,812
I'm basically convincing these
children, these young people,

165
00:07:03,812 --> 00:07:07,645
that kindness, empathy,
gratitude, work ethic,

166
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:13,430
not champagne - you'd be
mad at me - no champagne,

167
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,893
no girls, no private jets.

168
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,453
- I love everything you're talking about

169
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:19,392
until your 14 or 15.

170
00:07:19,392 --> 00:07:21,171
- But really, on a very serious note,

171
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:24,754
my ambition for my
legacy has, no question,

172
00:07:25,743 --> 00:07:28,449
taken a step forward
because I've basically

173
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:31,338
convinced myself, and this
is maybe selling myself,

174
00:07:31,338 --> 00:07:34,388
but, my God, if I can convince

175
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:37,305
seven to fourteen million young men

176
00:07:38,383 --> 00:07:42,503
that the new cool is the
things that I'm about,

177
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,576
these emotional intelligence skills,

178
00:07:44,576 --> 00:07:47,916
while still being an alpha, oof.

179
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:51,666
I could have a very real
impact on the world.

180
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:57,350
I really mean that, by the way.

181
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:01,251
- I believe it, and he,
for him to say to me,

182
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:05,225
at the last dinner we had, and
we haven't had many dinners.

183
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:08,392
He's like, "My daughter was showing me

184
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:12,879
"this thing about Gary Vee..."

185
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,552
- Is it Instagram with her? YouTube?

186
00:08:15,552 --> 00:08:16,385
You're not sure?

187
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:19,274
- YouTube. She knows that I
identify as an entrepreneur.

188
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:22,030
She is always starting things.

189
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,443
I'm always telling her how to do thing.

190
00:08:24,443 --> 00:08:26,486
Not necessarily how to do
the things she wants to do,

191
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:31,069
but how to do things, and
she found you somewhere on...

192
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:34,948
- Where I play.
- Where you play.

193
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,064
- And where they play.
- And she spends her time.

194
00:08:37,065 --> 00:08:39,741
And she fell in love with your motivation

195
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:42,788
and with your talks and
with your messaging.

196
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,716
And I said, "Alright".

197
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:45,934
And you know I got from her the other day

198
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:47,299
what I expected to get from her

199
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:50,216
which was nothing that I would find

200
00:08:51,301 --> 00:08:53,832
necessarily useful about you

201
00:08:53,832 --> 00:08:58,582
except how she connects to
you which I found fascinating.

202
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,344
- A couple things played out for me.

203
00:09:01,344 --> 00:09:03,465
I ended up with two interesting talents.

204
00:09:03,465 --> 00:09:05,244
One of a communication style that

205
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,547
can penetrate a noisy world, and two,

206
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,278
with a disproportionate understanding

207
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:11,058
of distribution of attention.

208
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:12,155
Muhammad Ali is Muhammad Ali

209
00:09:12,155 --> 00:09:15,617
because he understood where attention was.

210
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:18,396
People don't understand how
legends are actually born.

211
00:09:18,396 --> 00:09:20,432
It's not just the quality of your content.

212
00:09:20,432 --> 00:09:22,980
It's understanding when
the medium changes.

213
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,528
Literally, this is data.

214
00:09:25,528 --> 00:09:28,198
Madonna, Michael Jackson, and Prince

215
00:09:28,198 --> 00:09:30,531
were the most all in on MTV.

216
00:09:34,793 --> 00:09:37,462
So for me it's like a spooky...

217
00:09:37,462 --> 00:09:39,328
By the way, I'm always talking right now

218
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,615
as the agent of the human than the human.

219
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:46,115
I associate more with the
architect of what I'm doing.

220
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:48,515
I mean, 15 months ago I'm like,

221
00:09:48,515 --> 00:09:52,307
"Fuck it. I'm gonna get every
13-18 year old in the world."

222
00:09:52,307 --> 00:09:53,867
That's basically what I said.

223
00:09:53,867 --> 00:09:55,817
I literally had a meeting
today and was like,

224
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:57,036
"I'm gonna win India."

225
00:09:57,036 --> 00:10:00,462
And literally, remember
this, in 22 months,

226
00:10:00,462 --> 00:10:04,070
I'm gonna be like, "I'm
fuckin' huge in India."

227
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,737
And here's why and what and how.

228
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,420
It's super interesting, but
I think one of the things

229
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,627
that is super dangerous is allowing

230
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:17,699
any emotion or ideology to dictate,

231
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:22,032
in the face of very black
and white, human behavior.

232
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:26,438
I have never fought the
system of the human being

233
00:10:26,438 --> 00:10:30,290
even at my own peril and that
has made me very successful.

234
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,862
There's a lot of things I don't
like about the human being,

235
00:10:32,862 --> 00:10:36,195
but fighting it is a really big mistake.

236
00:10:37,031 --> 00:10:39,689
I think you have to be thoughtful

237
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:41,542
about where we are in the life cycle

238
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:44,943
of the middle man becoming
the internet to everything

239
00:10:44,943 --> 00:10:46,747
and how that plays out.

240
00:10:46,747 --> 00:00:00,000
