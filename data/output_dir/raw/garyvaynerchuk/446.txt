1
00:00:00,234 --> 00:00:02,169
- Gary and I have known each
other, we have this reference

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,804
that we've known
each other in passing.

3
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:05,205
Even though Gary
lives in New York,

4
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,974
the only place that
we've actually seen each other

5
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:10,344
or gotten together is
Austin for South by Southwest,

6
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,246
San Diego, we've
shared the same stage,

7
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:13,614
Mexico City.
- That's right.

8
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,549
- And we'll be in Australia
on the same stage--

9
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,651
- Am I going to Australia 
or is that the hologram?

10
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:18,585
- You beter go to Australia.

11
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,487
- I think it's the hologram.
- Your name's on the flyer.

12
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,756
- I got this
new hologram racket.

13
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:23,724
Cool.

14
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,627
- Alright, so I
asked him to come down.

15
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,662
Well, my people asked his crew.

16
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,831
Without blinking
an eye, he came here

17
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:33,333
and, trust me, we're
all industry individuals.

18
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,869
It wasn't about what's in it
for me, what I'm gonna get.

19
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,337
Very, very solid guy.

20
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:38,872
So, I respect the
fact that he's here,

21
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,407
and he didn't
want anything from me.

22
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,708
So, thank you for
being here, thank you

23
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,010
for being with my family.

24
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,444
- You're welcome. 
(audience applause)

25
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,079
Thanks for having me.

26
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,448
- I wanna get
into a couple things,

27
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:49,950
and then we're
gonna open up the Q&amp;A,

28
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,451
and what I wanna
know, first of all,

29
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,288
this is my
Rise and Grind Series.

30
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,223
And, I don't
wanna talk about low,

31
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,592
not low, but things that
startups need to know,

32
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,160
because the whole
concept of Blueprint and Co.

33
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,995
is you already have
the blueprint of business.

34
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,330
You already know
the fundamentals.

35
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,197
You need now to move forward.

36
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:07,167
And, my last book,
which was "Rise and Grind"

37
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:11,138
was about-- no, my last book,
which was "The Power of Broke"

38
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,006
was use the assets
that are in front of you,

39
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,242
and I know that Gary
believes in the same thing.

40
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,444
But, today, I want to
talk about the methods

41
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:21,214
that successful people have
that they do every single day.

42
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,683
When you were
growing up, did you have

43
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:25,152
a rise and grind mentality?

44
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,389
- When I was
growing up, there was a lot

45
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,824
of interesting
things going on with me,

46
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:35,462
which is, I was an immigrant,
and education was the way out

47
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,663
for immigrants.

48
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,499
Probably, still today, 
but, extremely,

49
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,969
entrepreneurship is "new cool".

50
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,805
It's an American thing, but
if you were an entrepreneur

51
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:47,207
in the '80s and '90s,
if you said that word,

52
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,743
that means you were
a loser with an idea.

53
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,244
(audience laughter)

54
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:54,414
And, so, I was in
a very weird place.

55
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,917
My whole world,
outside of my parents,

56
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:58,051
were telling me
that I was a loser.

57
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,820
My teachers were
telling me I was a loser,

58
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,621
my friends' parents were
telling me I was a loser,

59
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,290
'cause I was
getting D's and F's.

60
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,960
And the only way you were
scored as a child, at all,

61
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,862
there was no,
you know, I never understood

62
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:12,633
how in eighth grade
I'm making $3,000 a weekend,

63
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,835
and I'm a loser.

64
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:16,470
Because I have D's in science.

65
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,306
So, I think, when
people ask me like struggles

66
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,541
or things of that
nature, my narrative,

67
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,845
for most of my life,
probably from eight years old

68
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,714
to sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,

69
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:31,385
was, I was positioned as
I would not be successful,

70
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,720
because I wasn't
gonna go to Harvard.

71
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,656
- [Daymond] Yeah,
I gotta look back,

72
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,324
and I never saw anybody,

73
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,259
the only entrepreneur
I saw that looked like me on TV

74
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,461
was Fred G. Sanford,
the junk man--

75
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:44,664
(Daymond drowned
out by Gary's laughter)

76
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,235
- Yeah, it wasn't
even a conversation.

77
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,704
I wish, you know, first of all,

78
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,339
I don't truly wish,
I envy nothing.

79
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,508
But, it would've
been really cool

80
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,377
to be growing up
me during this era.

81
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,780
Right, it would've 
been really fun.

82
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,848
First of all, my
parents and I always joke

83
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,118
that I would never have
graduated high school, ever.

84
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,820
If eBay came out a decade early,

85
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,288
I would've sold
my entire family,

86
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,289
let alone everything
in the house.

87
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,090
(audience laughter)

88
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,261
So, yeah, look, I think
everybody deals with stuff.

89
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,033
I love competition, right.

90
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,136
I love competition, so I think
that's really saved me.

91
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,905
Even when 
I don't have adversity,

92
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,640
I fabricate it.

93
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,409
As a matter of fact,
I secretly, secretly think

94
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,345
that I've held back
my financial upside,

95
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,881
because I love
the process so much.

96
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,117
I genuinely know that
I could be more wealthy,

97
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,453
and sometimes think
back to the last ten years

98
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,488
of some of the
decisions I'm making.

99
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,390
I prefer the hard way.

100
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,025
- [Daymond] Do you
like the process because--

101
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:48,295
- [Gary] 'Cause it's my oxygen,
the process is my oxygen.

102
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,529
- Do you often feel
that people cheat you

103
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,632
if you go, and you give, and
you hire them for the process

104
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:53,633
and you don't know it?

105
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,734
'Cause I always
feel like someone

106
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,303
is gonna hold me
hostage in my business

107
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,972
if I don't know that process.

108
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,808
- Yeah, I don't even
think about other people.

109
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,009
(audience laughter)

110
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,377
I'm being dead serious.

111
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,580
Like, it's unbelievable how much

112
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,683
zero outside influence hits me.

113
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:12,152
And, so, Instagram's really
interesting to me right now,

114
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,553
because it's an
important platform,

115
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,288
I'm spending a
lot of time on it,

116
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,824
but it's probably the
most motivational version

117
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:18,825
of myself, right?

118
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,093
I only have a minute for video,

119
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,695
and I can only do
quotes, and pictures,

120
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:24,698
and so I'm fascinated by
that's where my growth is

121
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:27,634
right now, yet it's
such a single sliver

122
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:28,869
of who I actually am.

123
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,905
It's just one piece
of who I actually am.

124
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,974
But, the reason
I bring that up is,

125
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,510
it's hard to explain,
that's why this is fun.

126
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,944
We can sit here
and really get deep

127
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,846
into this stuff, in detail.

128
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,115
I don't think
about outside forces.

129
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,884
So, when I say things
in a one minute video

130
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,952
of who gives a shit
who the President is.

131
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,054
One way, left,
right, I don't care.

132
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,624
That's one version of
me talking about this.

133
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,826
I'm not worried
about anybody else.

134
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:56,296
- [Daymond] So, what was it
during your coming up,

135
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,533
your rise and grind,
what did you do methodically

136
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,333
every single day?

137
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,003
Tell me what you
did when you were 15

138
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,338
in your first 90 minutes
when you got up,

139
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,641
and your last 90 minutes,
to what you did today.

140
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,042
Has it changed?

141
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,211
Because you obviously
got educated somewhere,

142
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:14,748
so you cared about
what somebody was sharing,

143
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,850
'cause you could
absorb it one way or another.

144
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,819
- So, the one
consistent in my life,

145
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,720
I used to have nightmares.

146
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,289
This is actually
something I've never said.

147
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:24,257
I used to have nightmares,

148
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,359
and it was a very
reoccurring nightmare for me.

149
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,696
It was that my family and
I were going back to Belarus

150
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,666
on a plane, and
the plane would crash.

151
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,136
And, every time,
different people from my family,

152
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:39,139
usually one to three
people, would survive.

153
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,943
It was very dark, and
probably, in modern parenting,

154
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,778
my parents would be
forced to send me somewhere

155
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,446
to check out what
was wrong with me.

156
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,581
But it was consistent.

157
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:50,317
I will tell you,
I had that dream 50 times.

158
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:53,920
50 times between
second and seventh grade,

159
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,557
I dreamt that my
family had a flight crash,

160
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,359
and one or two of
them would survive,

161
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,129
and we'd walk through
snow, and it was very weird.

162
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,197
The reason I
tell you that story,

163
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,099
and the reason,
you asked the question

164
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,634
in an interesting way,
15 and now.

165
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:11,738
The only consistent in
my life has been perspective

166
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,340
and gratitude.

167
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,442
It's the only
consistent in my life.

168
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,510
Why I'm saying
"perspective and gratitude"?

169
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,013
Every morning I wake up,
and I make pretend

170
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,515
that my mother or
children or wife die.

171
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,516
Every day.

172
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,784
Every day, I did it today.

173
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,988
I quickly flash in my
mind what it would feel like,

174
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,990
'cause I'm very
in tune with myself,

175
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,426
if my son Xander,
who's four years old,

176
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,763
got hit by a car
crossing the street.

177
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,000
I promise you, if you're
in touch with your feelings,

178
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,635
and you can trick
yourself to feel it,

179
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:42,836
even right now
I felt it a little bit

180
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:47,507
and it really fucking hurts,
nothing else matters.

181
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,010
I'm completely
driven by gratitude.

182
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,779
I keep things in
very simple perspective.

183
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,181
I went up with
a very lovely lady

184
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,016
in the elevator,
she goes,

185
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,017
"Do you know how many
people you've inspired?"

186
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,952
I go, "Sure do."

187
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:01,288
I'm thrilled and
very in tune with my ego.

188
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,957
I'm also very thrilled
and in tune with my humility.

189
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,026
I think I'm the best,

190
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,694
and I think that if 
I disappear tomorrow,

191
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:08,795
nobody really gives a shit.

192
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:12,299
And, so, that yin and
ying is very important to me.

193
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:13,833
And, so, what I do consistently,

194
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,236
and have for thirty years now,

195
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,672
is I keep things in perspective.

196
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,540
This feels real nice.

197
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,609
Admiration, fans, selfies.

198
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,045
But, I don't know.

199
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,347
I'm just, 
I've got it very calc,

200
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:29,115
I understand what it is.

201
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,818
- [Daymond]
Everybody in this room,

202
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,587
they probably
were like you and I

203
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:38,224
when we were focused on our
career, and getting there,

204
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,592
you know, Mark Cuban
was funny when he said,

205
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,860
"A girlfriend said it
was me or the business,"

206
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,429
and he said,
"What's your name, again?"

207
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:43,963
(audience laughter)

208
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,366
- So, you know, we all
got to that point, right?

209
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,233
In our lives.

210
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,704
At what point did you get
to the point where you said,

211
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,973
"OK, now I have
to flip the 80-20,

212
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,243
and now I have to go and
start being with my family

213
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,347
and I have to make track with
that timing and I have to,

214
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,916
because you probably had
a healthy paranoia like me,

215
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,618
like, "Listen, I've
done so much to get here.

216
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,387
"I have to stay,"

217
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,489
and before you know it your
life can go like that, right?

218
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,323
Blam!

219
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,791
And now I know
it's extremely important

220
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,859
to go home with your family,

221
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,294
I have a new 11 month old,
and I know you,

222
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,429
you have a young baby at home.

223
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,697
At what point in
your life did you say,

224
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,366
"Wait a minute, let me
find a healthy balance,"

225
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,167
or did it start
from the beginning?

226
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,003
- I haven't.
(audience laughter)

227
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,038
- Yeah.

228
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,873
- I'm gonna tell you
guys the truth, I haven't,

229
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,008
meaning I run them in parallel.

230
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,411
I'm not crippled by the
current political correctness

231
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,279
of parenting.

232
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,748
You're looking at a
kid who didn't see his dad

233
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:35,914
until he was 14 years old,

234
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:37,317
and we have the greatest
relationship of all time

235
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,419
and I love him, and he
slept home every single night,

236
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,919
but I never saw him once.

237
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,256
That doesn't mean
my workaholic nature

238
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,424
will work for me and my kids.

239
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:46,426
I don't take that for granted.

240
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:49,462
I think that you
need to know how to breathe.

241
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,964
I know what makes me breathe.

242
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,699
My family makes me breathe.

243
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,235
But I've gotta
do what I wanna do,

244
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,302
like I have to.

245
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,670
I'll just break.

246
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,174
And so, I think
of it as in extremes.

247
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,276
The reason I answered,
"I don't," is I don't think

248
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:08,014
you find balance in any way
other than your own balance,

249
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,884
and I think that over
communication with your partner

250
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,553
and the variables in
that relationship are the key.

251
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,156
Right now, I have that
conversation with my wife.

252
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:19,159
In coming years, I'll have those
conversations with my kids.

253
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:23,196
But for me, I'm very
concerned about people

254
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,532
posturing to work-life
balance, when I know

255
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:28,501
that work-life balance
is extremely individual.

256
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,804
Everybody in here has
different work-life balance.

257
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,338
You also have different
work-life balance

258
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,873
at different times in your life.

259
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,743
I didn't have as
much work-life balance

260
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,711
as some other
people in the last 5 years,

261
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,947
but it now also
allows me to afford

262
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,116
to have work-life 
balance with my children

263
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,918
and my family in a
very different way.

264
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,619
As my daughter
Misha's now seven,

265
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,089
and she can go on
business trips with me.

266
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,957
The only conversation
I had to have was with my wife

267
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:54,427
saying, "School's bullshit.
Be okay with me taking Misha

268
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,762
"out of school for two days."

269
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,498
She might miss a science test,
but she'll always remember

270
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,134
going with Daddy to
Anaheim, he gave a talk

271
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,669
and then we went to
Disneyland for the day.

272
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:03,670
(audience laughter)
Right?

273
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,674
So, I think that my
answer to that is I haven't.

274
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,042
I work on it every day.

275
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,711
I communicate it
with my wife often.

276
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:12,779
- [Daymond] Do you work
on it internally, 'cause--

277
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,613
- Internally.

278
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,716
- [Daymond] 'Cause I wanna know,
what do you do, because...

279
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:17,650
I have 10 (audience
member coughing) goals set,

280
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,752
it's the first time I
ever read this thinking goals,

281
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,287
when I was 16 years old.

282
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,557
I goal set, and every single
night, five nights of the week.

283
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,960
I read 10 goals at
night before I go to bed,

284
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,595
'cause I want to
dream about those,

285
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,330
and I read the same
10 goals in the morning,

286
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,264
when I wake up.

287
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,098
- [Gary] Does that work?

288
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,800
Because I was, like in high
school, I used try to dream

289
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,568
about hooking up with chicks,
but then it would switch

290
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,237
quickly to some other shit.
(audience laughter)

291
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,839
- [Daymond] Well, my six goals,
are about health, faith--

292
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,974
- Good. (audience laughter)
- and things,

293
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,876
five and six months, and then
I have three other goals,

294
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,210
five years, 10 years, 20 years.

295
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,012
Do you have any
kind of method like that?

296
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:46,513
- No.

297
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,047
- [Daymond] As you said,
you're working on it?

298
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,149
I'm the most
binary dude you'll meet.

299
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,551
I love the journey.

300
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,320
I wish health and happiness,
like health for my family

301
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,956
is like, like big!

302
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,759
I feel I, you know,
you guys have known me

303
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,195
and I've known myself
through a very lucky period,

304
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,831
which has been my entire
life, which is, you know,

305
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,933
three of my four grandparents
died before I was born,

306
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,869
or one died right after,
so I never knew them.

307
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,372
We have a very small family,

308
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:15,408
right, I have three
cousins, you know, so,

309
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,277
I just haven't dealt
with a whole lot of death,

310
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:20,613
like, you know, I think when
I have to deal with death

311
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:24,584
in my inner circle, I'm curious
how I'm gonna play it out,

312
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:27,253
but I'm really binary, like

313
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,423
I love the process more than
the riches and the fames.

314
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,825
I have that goal to
buy the New York Jets.

315
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,094
That makes it fun,
that's a big goal.

316
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,763
It'll take me
some time to do that.

317
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,631
When people ask me, "When
are you gonna buy the Jets?"

318
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,366
and I always say,
"25 years from now,"

319
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,235
they're disappointed,
I'm pumped.

320
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,236
(audience laughter)

321
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,638
I've always found that,
that it's amazing to me,

322
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:46,873
(audience laughter) like, like,

323
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:47,740
they're like, literally disapp--

324
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,409
I'm like, "It's
three billion dollars,

325
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,243
"I have work to do."

326
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,545
(audience laughter)

327
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,249
But, yeah, man,
Daymond, I'll tell you like,

328
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,418
I want legacy.

329
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,920
I think the reason I'm
liked is 'cause I'll reply

330
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,956
to somebody who says
they're on the way here

331
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,992
to see me talk on
Twitter and reply to her,

332
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:09,329
like, I, I've, I'm
playing a different game.

333
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,532
I, Tyler's filming
today's DailyVee,

334
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,667
I met with a former employee

335
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,469
and he flat out,
like broke the wall,

336
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,804
and he was like,
"Dude, I just have to ask you,

337
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,873
"like, why did you
take that meeting?

338
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:24,010
"It's a former employee,
one that you fired.

339
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,044
"One that came to tell you that

340
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,013
"they were sorry
for not getting it.

341
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,548
"She pitched you stuff.

342
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:29,849
"You didn't get
anything out of it."

343
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,618
Like, I think the
way you put it was,

344
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,586
"You could've used
that time to make money,

345
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,221
or some, or do business."

346
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,323
and I said, he
said, "Why'd you do that?"

347
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,593
and I said, "Because making
money isn't the only thing

348
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,694
"that interests me."

349
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:42,629
- [Daymond] If you want
crappy meetings,

350
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:43,930
you got to come on
Shark Tank with me.

351
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,498
(laughing)

352
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,100
What keeps you
up at night, Gary?

353
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,368
And I'm not
talking about the health.

354
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,402
We established that already.

355
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,470
- That's it.

356
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,238
- That's it.
- That's it.

357
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,573
That's it.

358
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:56,042
Because everything
else I'm in control.

359
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,011
In business, I'm a beast.

360
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,946
Like I will always be
successful in business.

361
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,447
I was from six years old.

362
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,215
And I am now.

363
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:05,051
Like some people are pretty,
some people are athletic,

364
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,120
some people are
you know, whatever.

365
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,489
I'm a fucking ninja at business.

366
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,291
(audience laughter)

367
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,660
I am, I know how to make money.

368
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,196
- So what are the productive
tools that you emphasize?

369
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,499
And I know that
hard work is by far.

370
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,200
- Well, it's the
most controllable.

371
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,868
- Yeah.

372
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:25,038
- Like you're not, you know it
feels so controllable to me.

373
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,072
When somebody complains,

374
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,740
so, people get
my message confused.

375
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,675
They're like,
you're always talking

376
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,009
about hustle, where's life?

377
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,278
I'm like no, no, no, no, no, no.

378
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,614
If you're 100% happy like I am,

379
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,683
then I got no advice for you.

380
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:37,750
You've figured it out.

381
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,886
But you know who talks to me?

382
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,220
You know who cries to me?

383
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,289
I want my business to be bigger.

384
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,590
I want to make more money.

385
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,159
Like that's what
they're talking to me about.

386
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,962
So if, when my rich
friends complain to me about

387
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,998
not spending enough
time with their family,

388
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,167
they're really easy
to give advice to too.

389
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,501
Spend more time
with your family.

390
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,036
(audience laughter)

391
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,871
This shit is binary.

392
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,473
This stuff is so basic.

393
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:01,841
We complicate it.

394
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,408
- Yeah.

395
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:05,344
- So to me, 
I'm telling you the truth.

396
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,380
Like one thing I've been
thinking about a lot lately,

397
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,548
it's funny that
you brought this up.

398
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,884
Literally last night, 
it took me a little bit longer

399
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,386
to fall asleep than normal.

400
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,588
'Cause I was on a high, 
I flew to San Francisco,

401
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,790
took a one hour
meeting and then flew back.

402
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,425
I thought that was
funny and interesting,

403
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,728
and I enjoyed the
commuting to San Francisco.

404
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,664
And it took me an extra
30 minutes to fall asleep.

405
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,566
And it made me
realize, oh my God,

406
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,502
I fall directly
to sleep every night.

407
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:30,970
Every night.

408
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,806
Which I think speaks to peace.

409
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:38,778
Like I go to, I mean 
360 days a year,

410
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:41,748
I fall dead
asleep within seconds.

411
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,150
You could walk into my
house, rob the shit out of me,

412
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,787
'cause I'm sleeping. 
(audience laughter)

413
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:48,988
- [Daymond] Just thinking 
about how much you curse.

414
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,090
(audience laughter)
- I'm keeping it clean.

415
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,925
- [Daymond] Yeah I know, 
I know.

416
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,862
You know we all have
these fundamentals in business

417
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:57,830
that got us someplace
and I think that I drifted

418
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,265
away from it at a certain point.

419
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,800
So many of us do when
we get to a certain level

420
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,468
of being comfortable and happy.

421
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:06,038
Is there any
fundamentals that you revisited

422
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,673
because you lost
them at certain point

423
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,175
where you thought
they weren't necessary?

424
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,844
- I lost my hustle,
and I don't talk about

425
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:12,912
this that often either,

426
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,515
but I've thrown it
out for a few minutes.

427
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:19,585
Around 29, there was a
six to nine month period

428
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:23,089
where clearly to
me I was complacent.

429
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,123
I just got married.

430
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,592
You know, and so
that was a new variable.

431
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,761
Yeah, I just
remember my 30th birthday.

432
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,531
Literally my 30th birthday
I was driving to the store.

433
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:32,965
I looked myself in
the rear view mirror,

434
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,901
and I said
"You're full of shit."

435
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:37,670
"Your mouth is
ahead of your actions."

436
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,472
"You ain't buying the Jets,
you're not, going to buy a jet,

437
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,040
"you can't buy a jet airplane."

438
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,508
"Like get your shit together."

439
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:45,011
And that's literally when I
decided to start Wine Library TV

440
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,513
and go into the Web 2.0 thing.

441
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:52,151
And so I revisited my
hustle on my 30th birthday,

442
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,886
and I've never
worked harder since.

443
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,388
And it's been compounded.

444
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:58,291
I am working
harder right this second

445
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,760
than I ever have
in my entire life.

446
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,861
It's why I started DailyVee.

447
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:03,429
Just wanted to put
all of you on notice.

448
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,465
Like, you're not
working as hard as I am.

449
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,801
And I wanted to do
that because people think

450
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,837
they're putting in enough work.

451
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:11,938
They're just not.

452
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:13,406
I'm just having
hundreds of conversations

453
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,708
where people thought
they were working hard enough

454
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,144
for their ambition.

455
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,245
That's the key.

456
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,247
Like, if your ambition,

457
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,550
your ambition
dictates what you have to do.

458
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,086
And I'm happy when
people have ambitions

459
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,088
that allow them to
work 40 hours a week

460
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,056
and they're thrilled.

461
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,624
I just want as
many people to fall

462
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,292
asleep at night the way I do.

463
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,561
And I think the only
way you really do that,

464
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,029
is you have a real conversation.

465
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,831
'Cause everybody's
bullshitting themselves.

466
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,101
Putting that you're a CEO
in your Instagram profile,

467
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,671
doesn't mean that you're
a successful entrepreneur.

468
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,107
Means you're trying to be one.

469
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,876
- Let's talk about some
CEOs and some innovation.

470
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,278
You know many people in this
room were public speakers,

471
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:53,613
they advise people.

472
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,615
We go around the world
and we speak to people.

473
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,350
I notice, I don't 
know about you,

474
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,386
but half the time they want
me to talk to their staffs,

475
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,220
or anything else.

476
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,856
It's about innovation,
thinking outside the box,

477
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,424
how do you get people
within their corporation

478
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,526
to be motivated?

479
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,425
You find that the same thing?

480
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:08,993
And if so, how real are they,

481
00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:13,498
real are most of the companies
doing something about that?

482
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,800
Or are they just
sitting there and they talk,

483
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,270
ra-ra-ra, they clap their hands,

484
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,871
and they go back to the
same crap they've been doing.

485
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,539
- That one.

486
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,276
Because the leaders of these
companies are full of shit.

487
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,377
Because they didn't create
the framework for innovation

488
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,579
in their organization.

489
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,880
They just want to
point fingers and say

490
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,282
you need to be
innovating better.

491
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,684
Yet the rules and
the bonuses, and the game

492
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,786
is structured for not
innovation.

493
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,823
And the reason you
got such a heavy head nod

494
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:38,991
is people know that.

495
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:39,959
Like they tell you to innovate,

496
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,594
but then when you do
anything outside the box,

497
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:42,862
they put you right back in it.

498
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:45,598
- [Daymond] Is there
anything they can do?

499
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,099
Companies that have five people.

500
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,434
Companies that have 5000.

501
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,435
What can they do?

502
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:50,903
What are the
first steps they can do

503
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,406
to really activate
it without disrupting

504
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,708
their current operations?

505
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,677
- The most practical
answer I've ever given

506
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,680
anybody on this is
take 20% of your money,

507
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,616
your energy, 
your organization, your people

508
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,017
and make it go rogue as fuck.

509
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,353
Let them play, let it play,

510
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:08,821
however you want to define it,

511
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:12,224
with no rules and
then run your company

512
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,527
with the 80% that's left over

513
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:15,962
and build a good
enough company that

514
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:18,531
that 80% can afford for the 20%

515
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:21,400
to be a negative ROI experience.

516
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,368
- [Daymond] Are there any 
companies out there

517
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,402
doing it right?

518
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,204
What companies can you
name that are doing it right?

519
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,439
- I don't know.

520
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,374
The truth is one
of the biggest reasons

521
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:29,709
when people ask me
who's doing it right?

522
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,444
Or who's doing it
right on social media?

523
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,145
Or which companies
are doing it right?

524
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,380
I don't know.

525
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,783
I don't know because I
didn't look under the hood.

526
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,285
A lot of people
think certain things

527
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,354
are going great and they're not.

528
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,689
Don't forget, Daymond, 
this is something I want a lot

529
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,858
of the youngsters in
this room to think about.

530
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:50,029
If you're under 32 you need

531
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,998
to hear what I'm about to say.

532
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,599
You've lived
through a great economy

533
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,068
every part of your
professional career.

534
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,137
It's been good for the
last eight or nine years.

535
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,973
It just has we've bounced 
back since 2009, '10, '11.

536
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,174
We've only been growing.

537
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,676
There's only been growth.

538
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:04,877
No matter what anybody says.

539
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:05,978
That's what's happening.

540
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,949
So, I'm very concerned
about the next bubble burst.

541
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:10,883
- [Daymond] Lets talk about
that.

542
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,586
So I'm not
getting into politics.

543
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:14,787
That's not what we're here for.

544
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,322
We're here to talk
how to empower ourselves.

545
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,690
But, lets talk about this.

546
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,457
- Yes.

547
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,159
- [Daymond] Whether
it is, is somebody

548
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,861
gonna make this country great.

549
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,764
Whether it's I'm
gonna stay on welfare,

550
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,166
whether I'm
gonna go to a school.

551
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,535
Let's talk about the
number one job for males

552
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,970
in this country
is driving trucks

553
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,439
but when autonomous
vehicles come around,

554
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:36,042
Uber drivers and males are
gonna be out of business.

555
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:38,277
Lets talk about the
number one job for females

556
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:41,681
are secretaries and assistants 
but virtual assistants

557
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,950
are coming around and they're
gonna be out of business.

558
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,619
No matter who's
matter America great.

559
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,120
I'm 50 years old
and I'm driving a truck

560
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,955
and I'm gonna be happy
because there's gonna be

561
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,624
an 11% growth in
the next five years

562
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:55,294
then all of a sudden, bang
UPS, bang American Express,

563
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:59,432
Postal Service, Uber,
automated, you're all fired.

564
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,100
What am I gonna do then?

565
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,768
Because I'm sitting here
telling you that America's

566
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,403
gonna be great and
I'm gonna be good forever.

567
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,439
- Yeah, I'm mean look
that's going political

568
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,941
like anybody,
anybody that thinks

569
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,176
the President of
the United States

570
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:13,279
whether it's Barack or
Donald or Bernie or Hillary

571
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,249
is gonna help them,
they're a fucking loser.

572
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,517
(audience laughter)
Straight up.

573
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,386
- [Daymond] Absolutely.
- I promise you, you are.

574
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,889
(audience laughter)

575
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,626
Whether your president is
for minorities and females

576
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:30,863
or your president is for
the 26 year old white male

577
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,164
that's got no skills.

578
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:35,434
Here's the punch line
the market is the market.

579
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,336
What is the 54
year old gonna do?

580
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:41,006
Adjust or lose.

581
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,175
- [Daymond] Right, but
how do we get that message

582
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,577
out and say you know
what you could probably drive

583
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,711
a truck until you're 55.

584
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,881
You can program in tech 
and do those 'til you're 90.

585
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:52,118
Talking to BMW, they said
that they can't get enough

586
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:55,154
kids to be technicians 
because their theory

587
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:59,258
is the old mechanic

588
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,626
with the big 
grease on his shirt.

589
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:04,563
I was talking to the head of
the heavy machinery operations

590
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:05,798
meaning crane operators.

591
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:09,001
They said their jobs
are empty for 15 months.

592
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,237
These kids can go
to school for one year.

593
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,239
Come out making $150,000

594
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,641
but yet they're
going to a school.

595
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,010
50% of them will
retire with a title

596
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,446
of a job that
doesn't exist today.

597
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,914
They're staying in
school for four years.

598
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,282
Half of them
are digital classes.

599
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,917
They're leaving
with $300,000 in debt

600
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:27,219
and they still don't
know how to operate anything.

601
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,389
How do we get the parents in
this room to save that money?

602
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,224
How do we get the
kids in this room,

603
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:32,958
well not kids in this room

604
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,426
but who's gonna 
watch this online

605
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,195
to understand what they
need to do to move ahead

606
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:40,232
and not think a
diploma is gonna save me,

607
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,967
the president is gonna save me,

608
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,204
welfare is gonna
save me or anything else.

609
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:46,305
What happens then?

610
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,807
What needs to happen?

611
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:51,210
- Carnage.

612
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,779
Carnage needs to happen.

613
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,214
People are complasive.

614
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:58,551
Here's most
people's strategies in life.

615
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:03,756
(audience laughter)

616
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:05,357
- [Daymond] You 
holding your breath?

617
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:08,794
- I really have no
passion for this conversation.

618
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,997
If you are not capable 
in 2017 to Google shit

619
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,334
and figure out what's going
on in the world, fuck you.

620
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,936
(audience laughter)

621
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:19,738
I'm being really serious.

622
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,341
What role does
the government play

623
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,909
or thought
leaders or this and that.

624
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,311
Whatever that cliche statement

625
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:28,514
of like the teacher comes when 
the student is ready, right?

626
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,916
I believe in that thing.

627
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,620
I don't know,
lots of things happen.

628
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,722
Lots of things happen in life.

629
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,157
I woke one morning and realized

630
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:39,959
you know what this
liquor shipping law

631
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,760
is never gonna get better.

632
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,162
There's dirty politician money

633
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:44,430
they're gonna
keep paying this off

634
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,198
and I'm not gonna
spend the rest of my life

635
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,067
worrying about
what the right thing

636
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,002
to do is and what's right.

637
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:52,171
No, they're gonna keep
paying off the politicians

638
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:53,939
state by state and
because I'm the biggest

639
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,342
I'll always be
picked on so I adjusted.

640
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,277
I started over.

641
00:22:58,277 --> 00:22:59,511
I started over.

642
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,314
I started over.

643
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,449
This whole Wine Library thing

644
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:04,250
and I got so lucky, guess what?

645
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,018
I own zero percent 
of Wine Library

646
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:07,086
'cause it was
under my father's name

647
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,021
so I had no
collateral to even start it.

648
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:11,390
Started VaynerMedia 
by getting somebody

649
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,792
to pay me $80,000 to
do a marketing campaign

650
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,027
and I've built it.

651
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,662
So that's what's gonna happen
and everybody has their version.

652
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:17,863
Not everybody has
my business talent

653
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,698
to build billion
dollar companies.

654
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:22,768
But, if you're making 
$74,000 or $197,000

655
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:25,638
or whatever you're making
and your market gets fucked.

656
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:29,275
I don't see truck
driver Johnny feeling bad

657
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:32,344
for Rick the bookstore
owner cause Amazon came along.

658
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,445
(audience murmuring)

659
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,547
This has happened forever.

660
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:38,517
This is not the first
time innovation fucked shit up.

661
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,320
Nobody's crying for the
farmers in middle America.

662
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,055
Nobody's crying for
the people in Cleveland

663
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:45,391
who owned the docks.

664
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:47,993
This is what always happens.

665
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,995
So this is whats up now

666
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,097
and so what 55 year old Charles

667
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:56,235
has to do when he is out
of a job is get another job.

668
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:59,004
Whatever that job is.

669
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:02,107
So if Charles is
smart and has skills

670
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,343
he's teaching
himself something now

671
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:06,845
to be ready for
three years from now.

672
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,381
But, Charles
wants to watch football.

673
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,517
But, Charles wants
to drink at the bar.

674
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,185
- [Daymond] So he
needs to put his 20%

675
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,287
into what's going on in
the future and bank that.

676
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,656
- Mister, that's right.
You're damn right.

677
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,858
I wanna stay on
this for a second

678
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,427
'cause this is
massively important.

679
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:22,561
- [Daymond] No, 
it's very important.

680
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,496
We talk to people everyday
and they just don't get it.

681
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,965
- Then they will lose.

682
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:30,369
We have to start
getting into meritocracy.

683
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,538
Like somebody
should lose if they're

684
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,873
not seeing where
the puck is going.

685
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,975
If you're driving a truck today.

686
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,510
You know it's coming.

687
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,411
You've heard it.

688
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,013
Somebody told you.

689
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:43,916
At a bus stop, at a
truck stop, over dinner.

690
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,951
Somebody brought up this theory.

691
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,619
So either you take it seriously

692
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,889
and you start educating 
yourself or you don't.

693
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,925
That's the game.

694
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,493
Nobody's gonna fix that.

695
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,295
Nobody can help you with that.

696
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:58,297
That's life and
that's the historic nature

697
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:00,899
of human beings forever.

698
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,468
Just cause we're now living

699
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:04,837
and it's out turn to
go through something,

700
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,740
this has always happened.

701
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,476
- [Daymond] You're right. It's
just happening faster, I think.

702
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:12,211
- Great, adjust!

703
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,079
- [Daymond] So, let's, let's,
let's go shallow for a minute,

704
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,080
so let's talk about
social media today.

705
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,050
I think that, I recommend 
your book always,

706
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,451
"Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook,"

707
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,086
but, you and I
are having dinner,

708
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,121
and I think that you said to me,

709
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:23,789
"Well, I on to,"
you were doing Snapchat,

710
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:25,257
then you want to
Instastory this and that,

711
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,960
and I said, "You know,
most of us grew up with,

712
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,562
"you know, you know,
don't be a jack of all trades,

713
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,731
"be a master of one, and
I wanna kind of do this,"

714
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,900
and you reminded me,
kind of the joker, you know,

715
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,301
when he said in
that Batman movie,

716
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,370
"I'm like a crazy
dog chasing the car,

717
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,805
"I don't know what 
I will do when I get to it."

718
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:42,474
You just move on, 
move on, move on.

719
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:45,577
I said it before,
you have way more influence

720
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,212
on social media than I do.

721
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,514
Obviously, you're
doing something right.

722
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:50,516
How do you, you pick
which one to move on from

723
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:54,052
and just keep going and
it compounds on all platforms,

724
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,721
'cause they all
come together somewhere.

725
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,055
Just explain to me your theory,

726
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,726
because it's broken my theory
of be the master of one,

727
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,027
and not a jack of all.

728
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,263
- I think I'm the
master of attention,

729
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:07,266
I'm just not romantic
on a micro where it is.

730
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:10,369
So I think I'm speaking
the same language as you.

731
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:13,238
I think my
master isn't Facebook.

732
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,375
My master craft
isn't to tweet well.

733
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,011
My master craft is to know
where all your attention is,

734
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:21,246
and to be there and
put out quality content,

735
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,348
that brings you value
contextual to that platform.

736
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:26,652
So my master ship
is attention trading,

737
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:29,455
and then we're
looking at social media.

738
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:30,989
Like, you guys are
gonna have a real brain twist

739
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:34,426
if you've got me as the
social media guy in 17 years,

740
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,361
'cause I'm gonna be
onto something else,

741
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,529
or not!

742
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,432
I have no idea, but
wherever your eyes and ears are,

743
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,668
I'll be there.

744
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:43,969
- [Daymond] I'm gonna 
open it up in one second,

745
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,204
when to turn on in one second,

746
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:46,872
don't turn on the
live feed right now.

747
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:49,141
I just have to ask you
another question man to man,

748
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:51,977
so, I've gotten on the same
stage as you a couple of times

749
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:52,811
and you...

750
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:57,082
You will curse like a sailor
(Gary laughs)

751
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:58,617
like, really bad!

752
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,486
I will get on after
you, and I will say,

753
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:01,386
"Yeah, she was pissed!"

754
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:04,089
and then they'll
pull me aside and say,

755
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,557
"The word pissed, like--"

756
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,658
(audience laughter)

757
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,461
So, and I think
you know, might not be ABC,--

758
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,062
- Yeah, of course.

759
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:10,929
- And I do
whatever I have to do,

760
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,831
- You're fancy.
- get a little bit of respect.

761
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:16,101
Why do you, why do you
believe, not that you believe,

762
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,237
why do people buy that from you?

763
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:20,405
I understand
there's keeping it real,

764
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:23,275
but I mean, there's
keeping it raw, right?

765
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:24,776
Why do people
accept that from you,

766
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:27,079
and have you lost
money because of that?

767
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,080
- You just beat me to it.

768
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,548
Plenty of
people don't accept it.

769
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:31,917
I wish CAA was here
right now, Zach, you here?

770
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,252
No? 
(audience chuckling)

771
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:35,187
Like, we've lo-, 
I've lost tons of money.

772
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:36,722
I just don't give a fuck.

773
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:39,725
(audience laughter)

774
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:43,795
- Okay, but--
- I, here's what happened.

775
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:46,298
If you think,
here's, here's the truth,

776
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:48,467
I've never 
really clarified this.

777
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,903
I wasn't a public speaker,

778
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,704
I owned a liquor
store in New Jersey,

779
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,872
I was a businessman.

780
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:54,673
(audience laughter)

781
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,542
I'm 32 years old
before I ever took a stage.

782
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,610
Like, I didn't know,
like, I wasn't a personality.

783
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,046
This was, this was
not in the blueprint.

784
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,814
Okay? 
(audience laughter)

785
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,284
What happened was, I got invited
to an internet conference,

786
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:06,785
I'm like, okay, I'll do it,

787
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:09,221
and who the heck
knows what happened?

788
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:11,423
They gave me the mic, 
I got up there,

789
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,459
and the best way
I can explain it is,

790
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,895
in my formative
years of growing up,

791
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:20,866
I listened to an obnoxious 
amount of Richard Pryor,

792
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,768
Chris Rock and Eddie Murphy,

793
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:24,636
and when I watch
the way I give keynotes,

794
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:28,674
I do think it's got a
comedic timing delivery,

795
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:30,809
in the style of
those characters,

796
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,544
and so, I guess
that's what happened.

797
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,946
- [Daymond] And that's how you
did it, because of course,

798
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:36,515
most people would
say, "Listen, I'm dyslexic,

799
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:40,652
"I got left back, and I never 
graduated high school."

800
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:43,522
Alright, you know, 
my, my friends,

801
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:45,023
they wrote the
movie Belly about him,

802
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:48,760
so trust me, I've cursed
once or twice in my life.

803
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,596
Some people would say
it's a limited vocabulary.

804
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:52,664
Some people would
say that, you know what,

805
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,801
it's, it's a, it's an
inability to be articulate,

806
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:56,335
- [Gary] Yeah.

807
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:57,769
- and you know, we know
you're a smart guy already.

808
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,004
You come with the
most important thing,

809
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:00,606
which is common sense.

810
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:03,508
You don't feel that any time, 
you should adjust that?

811
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,043
I already know the answer, 
but I just wanna hear it.

812
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:05,944
(audience laughter)

813
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,980
- No, I think if you're
gifted with not worrying

814
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,716
about anything else, 
you just roll.

815
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:12,384
If you feel that I offended you,

816
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,820
or that I'm crass,
or that I'm not good,

817
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,154
or what have you, 
that's your truth

818
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,756
and I apologize.

819
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,191
It's not gonna
change how I roll.

820
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:19,925
- [Daymond] So, hold on 
one second, I just wanna try

821
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:20,926
one thing while I'm with you.

822
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,361
- Okay.

823
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:25,397
- [Daymond] Fuck! 
(audience laughter)

824
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:28,333
- How'd it feel?
(audience laughter)

825
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,167
- It felt good.

826
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,736
- [Gary] Yeah! 
(audience laughter)

827
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:32,337
- I like that, I like that.

828
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,839
Alright, so we're gonna, 
we're gonna open up,

829
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,674
we're gonna open up
to some live stream,

830
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:36,842
and really quick, 
we're gonna have

831
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:38,744
a couple of
questions from Twitter,

832
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:42,581
and then a couple from
the people in the audience.

833
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,349
So, who will
give me the questions.

834
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,484
- [Announcer]
Yeah, so let's see,

835
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:46,918
we're gonna start
with the audience first.

836
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:47,753
- Awesome!

837
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,254
- Start with the
audience first, okay.

838
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:53,358
- Let's do that!

839
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,093
- [Man] Can we 
come back there?

840
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,895
Do you just want 
to yell out loud?

841
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,196
- [Natalia] Oh, okay, fine.
- [Daymond] Yeah.

842
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,598
- [Natalia] I have two
questions.
Can I cheat?

843
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:00,198
- Yep.

844
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,800
- [Natalia] So first one.

845
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,202
I have a crew of people, 
like ten of us here,

846
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,071
we would love to
take a selfie with you.

847
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:06,905
- Done.

848
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,373
- What the questions

849
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,242
everybody is gonna
have to learn off tonight.

850
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:11,243
Maybe that's possible.

851
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:12,644
But please, make sure
that everybody in this room

852
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,578
learns off of your questions.

853
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:14,413
- [Natalia] Amen, yes.

854
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:15,914
- Amen.
- [Natalia] Absolutely.

855
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,816
The lesson here
is to be bold, yes?

856
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,650
- Yes.

857
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,584
Done.

858
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,520
- [Natalia] Question number two.

859
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,622
Question number two my name
is Natalia from the Bronx.

860
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:24,456
- Hi Natalia.

861
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:25,957
- [Natalia] And my
girlfriend, Brittany.

862
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,125
- Hey Britt.
- [Natalia] She's from Miami.

863
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,660
And we have
Muscles and Millions.

864
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,961
We are just starting out.

865
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:33,331
We are a lifestyle
and clothing brand.

866
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,466
We are about fitness 
for entrepreneurs-

867
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:35,867
- [Daymond] Muscles 
and Minions?

868
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,402
- [Natalia] Millions!

869
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:38,303
- [Daymond] Millions.

870
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,137
I wanted to make
sure everyone heard it.

871
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,439
Muscles and Millions.

872
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:41,373
- [Natalia] It's the
Bronx coming out of me.

873
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:42,207
- Go ahead.

874
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,543
- [Natalia] Millions. So my 
question to you GaryVee

875
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:46,878
is we saw, we
noticed you put a video up

876
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:49,848
regarding #BizDevSunday.
- Yes.

877
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,049
- [Natalia] We sent the email.

878
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,485
Can you expand on that
and how do we get you to

879
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:56,354
work with us and how
do we get endorsements?

880
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,923
Like what do we need to do?

881
00:30:57,923 --> 00:31:01,626
- So, I'll try to make this a
learning moment for everybody.

882
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:02,861
- [Natalia] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

883
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,465
So I think, you know, 
I'm a big fan

884
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:09,201
of jab, jab, jab, right hook.

885
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,370
I'm able to duck

886
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,639
right hook, right hook, 
right hook, right hook

887
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,209
and so I think the
biggest way for me to do things

888
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:20,445
is when I feel like
there is value in return.

889
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,246
When you get to,

890
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,048
I mean I couldn't imagine
what you're living through.

891
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,249
I think the biggest 
way to get somebody

892
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,852
who's got more
leverage than you do

893
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:29,755
is to disproportionately bring
them value to even the score

894
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:31,389
to make something happen.

895
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,357
- [Natalia] Can I?
- Yeah.

896
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,325
- [Natalia] We DM'ed you

897
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:36,094
and I offered you tons
of shirts and hats and stuff

898
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,462
and you never responded.

899
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:38,730
(audience laughter)
- Right.

900
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,564
I'll tell you why.

901
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,899
'Cause everybody did that.

902
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,667
(audience laughter)

903
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:43,969
- [Natalia] So now I'm here!

904
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:46,371
- [Daymond] Alright, we go
to go on to the next question.

905
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,240
- I think it's
about bringing value.

906
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,509
Your t-shirts 
bring me no value.

907
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:51,076
- [Natalia] Okay.

908
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,711
- So you need to figure
out what brings me value

909
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:54,613
and then you have
a shot of executing.

910
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,515
- [Daymond] So we
always teach that it's really

911
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:58,283
what's in it for the
person you are pitching

912
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,852
not matter what
you are pitching.

913
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,554
Whether you are waking up in
the morning and trying to get

914
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:03,822
to the bathroom
before your husband or wife

915
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:05,590
or you are trying to get
your child on the school bus.

916
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,492
And you say, "Please,
I'll take you to Chuckie Cheese

917
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,127
"if you just get on
the school bus right now."

918
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,962
It's always what
you are pitching.

919
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,697
We all get pitched
that type of stuff.

920
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,399
But you have to find
a way to bring value.

921
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,102
And honestly, you
most likely will see him

922
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,904
again and again and
again if you are persistent.

923
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,939
But the day that he feels
you're going to be successful

924
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,974
with or without him and 
you can bring him value

925
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:24,743
then it's worth a conversation.

926
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:27,212
- [Gary] I think tenacity
is way more commoditized

927
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:28,914
than people think.
- [Daymond] Exactly.

928
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,816
- There's a lot
of people hustling.

929
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:32,083
It's a value exchange game.

930
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,619
The reason I've popped
and have this fan base,

931
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,055
is there's a lot of
people saying hustle.

932
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,257
There's a lot of
people putting out content.

933
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,726
I'm disproportionately
trying to bring more value

934
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:45,697
in detail and motivation
and effort and engagement.

935
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:48,633
And I do answer
a ton of DM's but

936
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,570
I answered DM's the
entire six hour flight yesterday

937
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,671
from Instagram.

938
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:54,239
I didn't even get close

939
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:55,373
'cause I'm one dude.

940
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,042
And nobody is replying as me.

941
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:58,510
'Cause that's not me.

942
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,911
Nobody is replying as me.

943
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,714
You ever get a wink or a hello
or a I can't wait to see you.

944
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,015
That's me.

945
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,084
- [Daymond] I'll give you
one last one before we go.

946
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,619
When I used to
have shirts like that

947
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:08,954
and I couldn't get
an artist to where them

948
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:11,189
I would that artists
crew and their name on it

949
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,591
and then I would send it to them

950
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,025
that it was a collabo with us.

951
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,694
And I would tell
them take all the proceeds

952
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:16,695
and I'll sell it to them.

953
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:19,130
Take all the proceeds and give
it to your favorite charity.

954
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,766
- [Gary] And when he did it,

955
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:25,136
the supply and demand of
lifestyle brands was much lower.

956
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:26,605
It was more expensive to do it.

957
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:27,706
It was harder.

958
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:28,540
He figured it out.

959
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:32,444
The amount of people that
have some fucking saying

960
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:34,946
on a t-shirt right 
now is unlimited.

961
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,249
So you've got a
real fucking challenge.

962
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:39,150
'Cause the supply
and demand of your game

963
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,485
has gotten much worse.

964
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:41,586
- [Natalia] And we're ready.
- [Daymond] Alright.

965
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:42,354
- Good. Do it.

966
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,388
- [Daymond] Next question.

967
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:44,789
- [Man 2] This is a 
questions for both.

968
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,057
- [Daymond] And then 
we'll go to Twitter.

969
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,993
- [Man 2] Both Gary and Daymond,
which ever one wants to answer.

970
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:49,394
But I work with a lot
of young entrepreneurs

971
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,229
through Venture For America

972
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:55,867
and the one issue is I'm
curious how you guys judge

973
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,302
when you're working 
on a new business

974
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:58,803
or you're investing 
in a new founder

975
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,039
how do you know when
to tell them to give up

976
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,173
or how do you know
yourself to give up?

977
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,142
Because you want
to be consistent.

978
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,944
You want to keep
working and figuring it out.

979
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:07,345
So what's your solution--

980
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:08,179
- [Daymond] I want 
to expand on that

981
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,179
with that question for Gary.

982
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,315
I want to know exactly
that and I also want to know

983
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:12,317
when you are working with them

984
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:14,386
what you instill in them as well

985
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,388
when they are on their path.

986
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,789
So when do you
tell them to give up

987
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:21,126
and what do you say, you
need to do this everyday?

988
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:24,228
- So I think the key
is to not be consistent.

989
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,864
Because you can't give 
consistent feedback

990
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:28,132
for everybody. Like, 
I want to give feedback

991
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:29,501
based on what 
I was feeling there

992
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,136
but I might feel
something different here.

993
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:34,973
The key is I found
that somebody is either

994
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:37,676
impatient or too patient.

995
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,210
And so that is
always a key for me.

996
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,279
Like, some people are romantic

997
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,947
and some people are
not romantic at all.

998
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,350
And so I think I'm usually
pushing in the other direction

999
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,784
where they're over indexing

1000
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,420
'cause that usually 
tends to happen

1001
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,920
in the balance
of what they need.

1002
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,188
Some people are
just going to hold on.

1003
00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:54,391
So I just did a show, 
right with Apple,

1004
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:55,260
where we are doing these apps.

1005
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,460
So I mentored people.
It was little bit different.

1006
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,530
We had to be like "The Voice."
We had to coach them.

1007
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,131
This one girl just
didn't want to hear it from me.

1008
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,700
I'm like, "You're
not going to win."

1009
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,635
Like this is
not going to happen.

1010
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:04,803
I gonna be right or wrong but

1011
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,338
I was pushing her to be,

1012
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:08,506
she was so romantic 
and in outer space

1013
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,241
but she didn't
want to let go, right?

1014
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,810
On the flip side,
there was other people

1015
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,677
that were kind of rocky.

1016
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:13,712
And I'm like, "No, no, 
you've got something."

1017
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:14,879
And pushed towards it.

1018
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,582
So the truth is when I look 
at young entrepreneurs

1019
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,217
I don't give blanket advice

1020
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:23,188
I give individual advice of
the moment of where they are

1021
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:26,124
and what their business is
doing to really give advice.

1022
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,125
- [Man 2] Have you 
had a business

1023
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,760
where you decided
that it's time to give up

1024
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,594
this is not working?

1025
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,796
What was that
inflection point for you?

1026
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,566
- Yeah, I mean, I do a
lot of side businesses.

1027
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:37,502
Like, I've only really
run two core businesses

1028
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:39,270
Wine Library and VaynerMedia.

1029
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:43,475
Those are the only ones I've
ever really gone all in on.

1030
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,443
But, yeah, I mean
I've started side projects.

1031
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:46,845
I did a thing called VaynerToys

1032
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:48,613
where this whole
eBay flip challenge

1033
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:49,647
I tried to do with buddies,

1034
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,616
like Cork'd the
wine social network.

1035
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:56,054
I have jumped off of businesses
that I owned a big piece of

1036
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:57,856
but I wasn't the operator.

1037
00:35:57,856 --> 00:35:59,491
I haven't done it when
I've been the operator.

1038
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,793
I've seen them through.

1039
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:05,296
So I haven't had that exact
I'm the guy steering the ship

1040
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:06,264
and I have to jump off.

1041
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,465
I haven't had that experience.

1042
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,267
But I also don't 
build businesses

1043
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,403
for anything other than forever.

1044
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:12,637
Biggest problem with
a lot of people in here

1045
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:13,972
and the reason they will lose,

1046
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:15,974
the single reason 
they will lose is

1047
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,842
from the day they
start their business

1048
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,811
they're building it to sell.

1049
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,479
They want the money.

1050
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,983
That's why they lose.

1051
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:29,154
- [Man 2] Thank you.

1052
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:32,123
- [Man 3] What do you think
the future is of advertising

1053
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,659
and influencers between 
influencers coming in.

1054
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,194
What recommendations 
would you have

1055
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,830
for young influencers 
in different markets?

1056
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,265
- [Gary] I think 
influencer marketing

1057
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:42,934
is gonna have an incredible 
golden era of a decade.

1058
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,402
I think we're in
the beginning of it

1059
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,603
and I'm very fond of it.

1060
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:46,838
I think it's underpriced.

1061
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:48,840
I think the top is overpriced.

1062
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,008
So the people
that moved quickest

1063
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,910
and have big audiences
I think are overpriced

1064
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,112
because people think they're
more valuable then they are.

1065
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:55,313
You got to look at engagement.

1066
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:56,648
The amount of people
that have a million followers

1067
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,616
on Instagram but they
don't really have a community.

1068
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:00,985
Things like that.

1069
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,388
Word of mouth always worked.

1070
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,557
- [Man 3] Right, right. 
- I'm very bullish.

1071
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,159
My recommendation
is don't run around

1072
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,061
saying that
you're an influencer.

1073
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,130
Think about how to
bring value to your audience,

1074
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,699
create influence
and then monetize it.

1075
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,202
Again, we are living
through the greatest era

1076
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:20,238
of again, you just
put it on your profile

1077
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,439
and you think you're it.

1078
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,241
That's like me putting
on my profile right now,

1079
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,909
basketball player.

1080
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,010
(audience laughter)

1081
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,347
Cool, but I'm not getting 
paid by the Knicks. Right?

1082
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,585
The amount of accounts
that hit me up on DM like

1083
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:34,252
"Yo, I'm an influencer".

1084
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,355
I click and I'm like, "You have
800 people following you."

1085
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:40,725
"Yeah, but", I'm like no, no
you're not an influencer.

1086
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:44,095
By definition of
anybody's influence.

1087
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,097
If you have that in
your profile put a word

1088
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,534
in front of it:
aspiring influencer.

1089
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:51,636
(audience laughter)

1090
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,271
I'm very bullish on it.

1091
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,839
I think it's
underpriced right now.

1092
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:56,708
I also see,
because it's human beings,

1093
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,042
a scenario where
in two to three years

1094
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,878
it's gonna grossly overpriced.

1095
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:01,112
You just have to
follow the market.

1096
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,981
Right now it's underpriced.
- [Man 3] Right.

1097
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:03,815
- [Daymond] We're
gonna take one more

1098
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:06,084
from the in house audience.

1099
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,456
- [Man 4] Thanks. 
My question is scaleability in

1100
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,725
regards to people.
- [Gary] Yes, tough.

1101
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:16,094
- [Man 4] That's my
pain point right now.

1102
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:19,531
We've gone almost nine years
now and we've hit a spot.

1103
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:21,900
I can't find good people.

1104
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,903
You invest in people and
that's one of your things.

1105
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,070
- Are you the decision maker?

1106
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,007
- [Man 4] Yes. A lot 
of agencies as well.

1107
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:31,442
They all went to Vayner.
- Okay. (chuckles)

1108
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,511
- [Man 4] You acquire great 
people just by people that

1109
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,547
I work with. 
That's my pain point.

1110
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:36,848
What do you do?

1111
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:39,050
'Cause none 
of the sites work.

1112
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,552
- Yeah, I agree.

1113
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,420
How many people do you interview

1114
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,589
for every person that you hire?

1115
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:46,257
What's a rough number you think?

1116
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,926
- [Man 4] At least 10 to 12.

1117
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,928
- It sounds like you're just
gonna have a funnel problem.

1118
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:52,997
That's not that bad.
- [Man 4] Yeah.

1119
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,265
Here's my answer.

1120
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:54,933
- [Daymond] Get a 
desk here at Blueprint,

1121
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:55,667
you'll find people here.

1122
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,336
Trust me. 
- I love the hustle.

1123
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:03,141
I really think
that peoples flaw is,

1124
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:05,143
so one of the reason's I
think we've been successful

1125
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:07,712
is I'm not crippled by hiring.

1126
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,348
I focus on firing.

1127
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,016
I think way to
many people are fancy

1128
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,085
and think they're
a so good at hiring.

1129
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,487
Everybody's got this dream
that they're so good at hiring.

1130
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,991
I think I have unbelievable EQ
skills and people intuition.

1131
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:24,696
I think it actually all I've
got and I've mis-hired a ton.

1132
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,932
I think too many people
are fancy in their hiring.

1133
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,501
They have this bullshit
self esteem within themselves

1134
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,070
that they're good at it.

1135
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,005
My answer to you is to, 
if you're number

1136
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:36,074
is one out of twelve
and you can't get more in

1137
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:38,243
I would just hire
three out of twelve

1138
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:39,611
because people
will surprise you.

1139
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:42,547
My model is more of

1140
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,283
Vayner gets the most out of you

1141
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:48,019
and thus if you're a B
you'll be a B+ with me.

1142
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:49,520
I'm also not crippled.

1143
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,656
You need B's and C's.

1144
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:52,924
I love when my friends are like,

1145
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:54,859
"How do you get your employees
to care as much as you?"

1146
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,794
I'm like, "I don't."

1147
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:59,564
The fuck should an
employee care as much as I do?

1148
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,065
It's my business.

1149
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,234
They need to
care about their life.

1150
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,503
- [Daymond] Do you bring in the
B's and C's and make them A's.

1151
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:06,504
- Sometimes.

1152
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,940
- [Daymond] My
staff started as interns

1153
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:13,244
at one time or another
in college, of course.

1154
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,246
I don't look for
the perfect person.

1155
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,383
Though I want them
to come fit in a perfect way

1156
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:19,684
but they're gonna
come in with their flaws.

1157
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:20,952
That's what I find.

1158
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:23,154
- [Gary] I would say that
also everybody's definition

1159
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,290
of an A is different.

1160
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,458
I would just be more optimistic.

1161
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,459
I mean that.

1162
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:31,396
It's a funny little switch
of optimism versus cynicism

1163
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:33,164
and pessimism
on the hiring front

1164
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,999
that could really work for you.

1165
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,769
I think that puts
pressure on you to be better.

1166
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:41,239
You know? I know that 
I have less of a filter in.

1167
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:43,541
Which puts pressure 
on us to be better

1168
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,610
at giving them
opportunity to succeed.

1169
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,912
Plus, once
they're in, we spend most

1170
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:50,014
of the first three to
six months auditing them

1171
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,783
and then
reverse engineering them

1172
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,685
and putting them in the
best positions to succeed

1173
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:55,486
'cause not everybody 
does everything well.

1174
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,155
I genuinely believe that I work

1175
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:59,223
for everybody that works for me.

1176
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,358
Not the other way around.

1177
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:01,759
- [Daymond] We're
gonna take two questions

1178
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,695
from live streaming.

1179
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,163
- [Man] If people
still have questions,

1180
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:07,732
use the hashtag
#blueprintgaryvee.

1181
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:12,670
That's GaryVee, two e's.
(audience laughter)

1182
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,106
- I'm so good at branding 
I created my username

1183
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:18,343
to be two silent fucking E's.
(audience laughter)

1184
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:19,711
- [Man] Eric Davis asks,--

1185
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:23,147
- Eric Davis
the Cincinnati Red's

1186
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,049
phenomenal baseball player?

1187
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,250
- [Man] Not that Eric.
- Got it.

1188
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,885
(audience laughter)

1189
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,955
- [Man] Is there long term
downside to moving too fast?

1190
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:34,192
Is there balance being
aggressive and respectful?

1191
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:38,329
- Again, the biggest
fear I have right now

1192
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:42,400
is that we are in the
greatest era of blanket advice.

1193
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,735
It's just like general advice.

1194
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:46,270
I have to move fast.

1195
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,805
Everybody tells me
Vayner was not going

1196
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,807
to be successful
if I moved too fast.

1197
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,343
They were wrong cause I'm fast.

1198
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,277
I like action.

1199
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,846
When I walk
through Vayner's office

1200
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,048
if it's quiet I freak out.

1201
00:41:57,048 --> 00:41:58,549
I tell people, play music.

1202
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,518
I need the action.

1203
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,020
I need to go fast
and I'm a good enough

1204
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,356
salesperson to
compensate for the overhead

1205
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,125
and I can stay ahead of it.

1206
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:10,061
I think you grow as
fast as you're capable.

1207
00:42:10,061 --> 00:42:12,864
Right? I think that,
that person Eric Davis

1208
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:18,002
needs to know how
good he is to grow as fast.

1209
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:22,640
Listen, everything doesn't
work and everything works.

1210
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,908
Let's play out the scenario.

1211
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,309
I grew too fast.

1212
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,344
I couldn't afford my staff.

1213
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:27,211
I had to cut people.

1214
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,614
Then people got scared that
we weren't stable they quit

1215
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:31,282
and my shit got fucked up.

1216
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:32,884
That's scary of going too fast.

1217
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:36,287
Let me tell you what
happens way more often.

1218
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:38,456
90% of this room
is going too slow

1219
00:42:38,456 --> 00:42:39,957
and has left tons
of money on the table

1220
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:42,593
but they don't know
it 'cause it's hidden.

1221
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,495
People are scared of the hidden

1222
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,297
and they're safe on
the black and white.

1223
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,666
It's obvious if
you went too fast

1224
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,269
and you broke and
you had to let people go.

1225
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:54,839
It's not obvious to anybody 
if you're doing a million

1226
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:55,973
but you should be
doing $3 million

1227
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:57,809
but you're going too slow.

1228
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:00,078
People are scared 
because they care

1229
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,280
about what other people think.

1230
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:04,582
- [Daymond] Next
question, are we cool?

1231
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,884
- [Man] Alright, cool. 
We have Paula Wolf.

1232
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:09,353
What's the most
effective way to market

1233
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:12,089
small business
who are on a budget?

1234
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,958
- Doing stuff that
doesn't cost money.

1235
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,226
(audience laughter)

1236
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:18,963
So Wine Library, first
year $14,000 marketing budget.

1237
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:21,766
I printed shit on my computer

1238
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:22,934
and went to the Short Hills Mall

1239
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,101
and put it on people's,

1240
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,672
like, you know, the flyer's
on your fuckin' windshield?

1241
00:43:27,672 --> 00:43:29,173
Like ghetto shit.

1242
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,741
(audience laughter)

1243
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,478
I wish I had
fuckin' social media.

1244
00:43:33,478 --> 00:43:34,345
You like that, right?

1245
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:35,580
Like it was just like,

1246
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,414
you do what you can,

1247
00:43:36,414 --> 00:43:37,582
I mean I love
when everybody's like,

1248
00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:38,850
"Well it's easy for you."

1249
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,518
It wasn't always.

1250
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:41,352
- [Daymond] Power of broke.

1251
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,321
- You know like,
it wasn't always.

1252
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:45,223
Like, you weren't with me

1253
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:48,392
when I was in my house printing
on that slow ass computer,

1254
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,228
you know, 20% off a case of wine

1255
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:51,462
and then I grabbed 
the whole thing

1256
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,197
and then I fuckin' 
woke up at 6 A.M.

1257
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:54,465
and went to the Short Hills Mall

1258
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,033
and just went and
put that on the flyers,

1259
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:57,768
you weren't with me.

1260
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:02,807
- [Daymond] One last one?

1261
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:03,774
Alright, I'm
gonna take one last one.

1262
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:05,042
- Let me, can I expand on that?

1263
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:06,077
- [Daymond] Yeah, of course.

1264
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:07,678
(audience laughter)

1265
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:08,312
(thumping)

1266
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,547
We're fancy.

1267
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:14,585
We're fancy, 'cause it's
been good for eight years.

1268
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:15,686
I'm telling you right now,

1269
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,288
look yourself in the mirror,

1270
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:18,856
if you have ambitions to win,

1271
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,025
you're fancy.

1272
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:22,560
You're fancy.

1273
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,295
People think
things are below them.

1274
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:26,574
I still don't think
things are below me.

1275
00:44:26,574 --> 00:44:27,743
Like nothing is below me.

1276
00:44:27,743 --> 00:44:29,177
I'll do anything.

1277
00:44:29,177 --> 00:44:30,312
People got fancy,

1278
00:44:30,312 --> 00:44:32,914
want to play the
part of entrepreneur.

1279
00:44:32,914 --> 00:44:34,712
You can act all you want.

1280
00:44:34,712 --> 00:44:35,880
The market's coming.

1281
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,616
Wait 'til there's no VC money.

1282
00:44:38,616 --> 00:44:41,819
Wait 'til you actually 
have to make money.

1283
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:44,756
- [Daymond] Stop comparing
everybody's sizzle reel

1284
00:44:44,756 --> 00:44:45,657
to your blooper reel.

1285
00:44:45,657 --> 00:44:47,592
Everybody's going
through the same stuff.

1286
00:44:47,592 --> 00:44:49,594
So you have to
exercise the power of broke,

1287
00:44:49,594 --> 00:44:51,629
no matter if, the people I know
exercise the power of broke

1288
00:44:51,629 --> 00:44:53,398
more than anybody else,
are the people that have money.

1289
00:44:53,398 --> 00:44:54,933
- [Gary] 100%.

1290
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:56,491
- All the lines that,
you know, my partners and

1291
00:44:56,491 --> 00:44:59,270
I play out after we
were already established

1292
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:01,239
instead of going and
a normal clothing line

1293
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:03,308
would take about

1294
00:45:03,308 --> 00:45:05,410
120 days and about $50,000

1295
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:08,713
to create the
entire product line.

1296
00:45:08,713 --> 00:45:10,949
I could go to Ralph Lauren

1297
00:45:10,949 --> 00:45:12,283
and rip the label off of here,

1298
00:45:12,283 --> 00:45:15,053
sew some embroidered
crap on it, the name,

1299
00:45:15,053 --> 00:45:17,355
pay somebody $2,500, 
put it in a video,

1300
00:45:17,355 --> 00:45:18,189
and sit there and watch it,

1301
00:45:18,189 --> 00:45:19,824
the phone's gonna ring.

1302
00:45:19,824 --> 00:45:20,892
Phone rings, alright,

1303
00:45:20,892 --> 00:45:23,428
make some more shirts.

1304
00:45:23,428 --> 00:45:26,531
And I save time, I save
energy, and I save the cost.

1305
00:45:26,531 --> 00:45:28,866
And the hustle never stops
when we're talkin' about that.

1306
00:45:28,866 --> 00:45:32,170
You have to think OPM
is other people's money?

1307
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:33,838
No it's other people's
manufactured mind power,

1308
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:35,073
marketing, mentors,

1309
00:45:35,073 --> 00:45:36,908
and making money for
other people's mistakes.

1310
00:45:36,908 --> 00:45:38,910
I want everybody to
give it up for GaryVee.

1311
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,178
(audience clapping and cheering)

1312
00:45:40,178 --> 00:45:42,146
Thank you Gary for having me.

1313
00:45:42,146 --> 00:45:44,649
And being here with us, 
I appreciate it.

1314
00:45:44,649 --> 00:45:46,150
Let's get the
fuck up outta here.

1315
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:47,619
I could use those words now.

1316
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,234
- [Gary] Thank you.
- [Daymond] Thank you, man.

1317
00:45:49,234 --> 00:45:50,318
Good?

1318
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:51,212
- Great.
- Thank you.

1319
00:45:51,212 --> 00:45:52,547
- I still want
to talk about fancy.

1320
00:45:52,547 --> 00:45:54,449
- Oh wait, let's
talk about fancy.

1321
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:56,317
- Can we stay another minute?
- This is what makes him him.

1322
00:45:56,317 --> 00:45:57,152
- Can we stay?

1323
00:45:57,152 --> 00:45:59,187
I'm not fulfilled yet.

1324
00:45:59,187 --> 00:46:00,555
On this, I mean this.

1325
00:46:00,555 --> 00:46:01,656
I don't know,
Tyler how am I doing?

1326
00:46:01,656 --> 00:46:02,490
We doing alright?

1327
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:03,324
Yana's in the crowd right?

1328
00:46:03,324 --> 00:46:04,159
She's somewhere here?

1329
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:04,959
Yana.

1330
00:46:06,154 --> 00:46:07,715
We're fancy.

1331
00:46:07,715 --> 00:46:11,823
We have to have this
conversation in this space.

1332
00:46:11,823 --> 00:46:13,424
Like, we've got to.

1333
00:46:13,424 --> 00:46:16,194
Every entrepreneur in
here has it so much better.

1334
00:46:16,194 --> 00:46:18,663
It's called the
internet at scale.

1335
00:46:18,663 --> 00:46:21,766
So many things are easier
than what we came up with.

1336
00:46:21,766 --> 00:46:23,601
Right, you can DM the person

1337
00:46:23,601 --> 00:46:25,637
and maybe get to them.

1338
00:46:25,637 --> 00:46:28,406
I just, I want you guys to win

1339
00:46:28,406 --> 00:46:31,009
which is why I talk about this.

1340
00:46:31,009 --> 00:46:33,111
Like, when the money dries up,

1341
00:46:33,111 --> 00:46:35,079
when the economy gets tighter,

1342
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:36,347
all of this goes away,

1343
00:46:36,347 --> 00:46:39,496
and the majority of
this market right now is

1344
00:46:41,202 --> 00:46:43,705
on bubble gum and dreams

1345
00:46:43,705 --> 00:46:48,042
and like, you've got
to know how to make money.

1346
00:46:48,042 --> 00:46:49,544
Like, you have
to have a business.

1347
00:46:49,544 --> 00:46:51,713
Your product has to bring value.

1348
00:46:51,713 --> 00:46:53,298
Like the tried and
true is the only thing

1349
00:46:53,298 --> 00:46:55,256
that's gonna
make you successful.

1350
00:46:55,256 --> 00:46:57,525
People running around
here trying to raise money.

1351
00:46:57,525 --> 00:46:59,059
Oh, I can't raise money

1352
00:46:59,059 --> 00:47:01,695
because I didn't go
to that kind of school.

1353
00:47:01,695 --> 00:47:03,330
Or I can't raise money

1354
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,766
because I didn't come
from that kind of neighborhood.

1355
00:47:05,766 --> 00:47:07,601
Don't raise money.

1356
00:47:07,601 --> 00:47:09,626
Make money.

1357
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:12,990
It doesn't take a hero to give
up a piece of their business.

1358
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,258
Make it.

1359
00:47:14,258 --> 00:47:17,060
- [Daymond] So all the 
balls to the wall concept.

1360
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,762
Should you quit
your day job or not?

1361
00:47:18,762 --> 00:47:22,299
- I think you have to
be practical and hungry.

1362
00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:24,468
Like, you should
not quit your day job

1363
00:47:24,468 --> 00:47:26,703
if you've got crazy
compounding interest

1364
00:47:26,703 --> 00:47:28,272
on your student loans,

1365
00:47:28,272 --> 00:47:30,140
or you got to pay your mortgage.

1366
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,843
But what you shouldn't 
do is have that job,

1367
00:47:32,843 --> 00:47:33,944
talk shit that you're gonna

1368
00:47:33,944 --> 00:47:35,579
build some big business one day,

1369
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:38,482
and then at 6 o'clock 
at night not work.

1370
00:47:38,482 --> 00:47:40,784
Like you need to
go to sleep at 3 A.M.

1371
00:47:40,784 --> 00:47:43,387
Like you need to back
your fuckin' mouth up.

1372
00:47:43,387 --> 00:47:45,422
Everybody's talkin' shit.

1373
00:47:45,422 --> 00:47:46,723
Everybody's talkin' shit.

1374
00:47:46,723 --> 00:47:48,091
Everybody's talkin' shit.

1375
00:47:48,091 --> 00:47:50,160
Everybody loves to hit
me up, GaryVee hustling,

1376
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:50,994
I look at their account

1377
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:52,829
and they're like
playing ping pong at 4:30.

1378
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:54,898
(audience laughter)

1379
00:47:54,898 --> 00:47:56,600
Like people don't
understand what hustle is.

1380
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,102
I took one vacation in my 20s.

1381
00:48:00,571 --> 00:48:02,463
But I have crazy aspiration.

1382
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:03,965
You should take 11.

1383
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:04,799
But don't come telling me

1384
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:07,969
you're gonna buy the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

1385
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:10,405
And so like, the first thing
is figure out who you are,

1386
00:48:10,405 --> 00:48:11,663
and what you want.

1387
00:48:11,663 --> 00:48:13,765
And then deploy
real self-awareness.

1388
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:14,666
But I'm telling you,

1389
00:48:14,666 --> 00:48:15,600
the thing that I'm fearful of

1390
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,102
and the reason I didn't 
step off stage yet is

1391
00:48:18,102 --> 00:48:20,705
it's been so good
for almost a decade.

1392
00:48:20,705 --> 00:48:22,140
This has been easy.

1393
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,375
There's so much money out there.

1394
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:26,811
Everybody's getting
money for their dumb ideas

1395
00:48:26,811 --> 00:48:28,146
that make no money.

1396
00:48:28,146 --> 00:48:29,147
And if you're not,

1397
00:48:29,147 --> 00:48:31,316
then you should
really even question that.

1398
00:48:31,316 --> 00:48:32,650
Like if you haven't
been able to raise money,

1399
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:35,199
you really fuckin' suck

1400
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:37,488
because the market is
ridiculously ridiculous,

1401
00:48:37,488 --> 00:48:38,556
like terrible.

1402
00:48:38,556 --> 00:48:39,958
Like people are
getting funded for everything.

1403
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:40,892
So if you haven't been able

1404
00:48:40,892 --> 00:48:42,126
to figure out how to get money,

1405
00:48:42,126 --> 00:48:44,529
you're a triple loser.
(audience laughter)

1406
00:48:44,529 --> 00:48:46,264
So the way to answer
that and punch me in the face

1407
00:48:46,264 --> 00:48:47,498
and tell me that you're not

1408
00:48:47,498 --> 00:48:49,334
is go make money
instead of dwelling

1409
00:48:49,334 --> 00:48:51,069
why you haven't raised it.

1410
00:48:51,069 --> 00:48:52,804
I promise you
something about money.

1411
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,138
Money's real funny.

1412
00:48:54,138 --> 00:48:55,740
Real funny.

1413
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,875
Money doesn't care
what you look like.

1414
00:48:57,875 --> 00:48:59,310
You may think it does

1415
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:01,479
but that's your fuckin' excuse.

1416
00:49:01,479 --> 00:49:03,081
Money wants to make money.

1417
00:49:03,081 --> 00:49:04,916
I'll give a Patriots fan money,

1418
00:49:04,916 --> 00:49:05,917
that's how much 
I want to make money.

1419
00:49:05,917 --> 00:49:07,252
(audience laughter)

1420
00:49:07,252 --> 00:49:08,186
You understand?

1421
00:49:08,186 --> 00:49:09,954
You can say
anything you want about

1422
00:49:09,954 --> 00:49:11,222
you don't look the part.

1423
00:49:11,222 --> 00:49:14,826
White woman, black woman, 
not from this country.

1424
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,895
Money wants to make money.

1425
00:49:16,895 --> 00:49:19,697
So if you're not
getting it, you suck.

1426
00:49:19,697 --> 00:49:21,866
So then go make it
instead of dwelling that

1427
00:49:21,866 --> 00:49:25,303
the old white guy in VC land's
not giving me any money.

1428
00:49:25,303 --> 00:49:27,272
It's 'cause your shit sucks.

1429
00:49:27,272 --> 00:49:28,106
(audience laughter)

1430
00:49:28,106 --> 00:49:30,275
And so the only way
you can prove me wrong

1431
00:49:30,275 --> 00:49:31,776
is to go execute.

1432
00:49:31,776 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
