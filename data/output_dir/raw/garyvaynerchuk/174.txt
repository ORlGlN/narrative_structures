1
00:00:00,387 --> 00:00:02,325
- I have a big idea.

2
00:00:02,325 --> 00:00:04,106
- Well, what are you going to do man?

3
00:00:04,106 --> 00:00:05,973
You get to, you can figure out

4
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:07,415
how to pull yourself up without that...

5
00:00:07,415 --> 00:00:09,998
(upbeat music)

6
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:15,754
10:44 Eastern Time, Friday, September

7
00:00:15,754 --> 00:00:16,908
what's today, the 9th?

8
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:19,126
- What day is it Mike? Ha ha ha ha ha

9
00:00:19,126 --> 00:00:21,759
- 8th, Friday, September
8. Gary's on a board call

10
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:25,296
at 9:44. It was not on the calendar.

11
00:00:25,296 --> 00:00:27,147
The request came in, gotta
move a couple things.

12
00:00:27,147 --> 00:00:27,980
(whistle)

13
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,091
Zee, making moves on her end.

14
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:32,587
- Happy Friday, everyone. Welcome.

15
00:00:32,587 --> 00:00:34,189
- Now he's on the board call.

16
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:35,022
What's up?

17
00:00:35,022 --> 00:00:36,536
(bell)

18
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,743
- I want to make sure I'm understanding

19
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:39,073
what you're saying here.

20
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:43,240
You're super pumped about the
thought process and strategies

21
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,177
behind post production of
the DailyVee vlog on YouTube

22
00:00:49,177 --> 00:00:51,283
because you love the YouTube ecosystem.

23
00:00:51,283 --> 00:00:52,989
[voice on speaker phone]
- Yeah, and I'm finding

24
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:55,982
we have this chance to do
something big right now.

25
00:00:55,982 --> 00:00:58,308
How are you feeling about
the up from yesterday?

26
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,945
- I'm feeling great, but I'm also

27
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:01,778
a little bit more patient
than everybody, right,

28
00:01:01,778 --> 00:01:03,044
like if today's is not good,

29
00:01:03,044 --> 00:01:04,522
I'm feeling great about that too, right.

30
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,575
It'll also give us context.

31
00:01:06,575 --> 00:01:08,649
We'll read the qualitative
feedback from the audience.

32
00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:10,077
A lot of them are still
going to say it's great

33
00:01:10,077 --> 00:01:11,695
because they just like me.

34
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:15,065
- I'm from the DailyVee today.
We are changing our style

35
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:18,202
so usually we just
document Gary's whole life;

36
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:19,774
we make a narrative out of that,

37
00:01:19,774 --> 00:01:21,699
but we're trying to go to
more the creative route.

38
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:23,860
We're so used to recording everything

39
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,600
and we're really trying
to push against that,

40
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,007
kind of balance when to
film, when not to to film.

41
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:33,340
(hip hop music playing)

42
00:01:38,662 --> 00:01:40,806
[offscreen voice]- Right
now Gary is in a meeting.

43
00:01:40,806 --> 00:01:43,662
It's 11:45. #AskGaryVee isn't set up yet.

44
00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:45,271
- Hi everybody. I'm Gary Vee,

45
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,069
and this is the #AskGaryVee show.

46
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:50,652
So 268. Wow. It feels
good to be back. Huh?

47
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:53,508
What a layover. (studio laughing)

48
00:01:53,508 --> 00:01:55,549
Ross, thank you so much for coming today.

49
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,116
Boy, man, I love your shit.

50
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:59,148
- 12:04, we managed to set it up.

51
00:01:59,148 --> 00:02:00,112
Squad, we roll deep.

52
00:02:00,112 --> 00:02:02,251
[offscreen voice] - Will you sit down?

53
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:04,383
- Yeah, I'm sorry. (laughter)
Yeah, I'll sit down.

54
00:02:04,383 --> 00:02:06,375
- You know the word we get
them both dropping here?

55
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,812
You got to drop fire?
I got to drop feather.

56
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:09,645
- Done.

57
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:10,766
[Offscreen voice] -Okay?

58
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:11,807
- Fire, feather.

59
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:13,040
[Offscreen Voice] -I got
feather, you got fire.

60
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,502
- Done. (bell)

61
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:16,715
Everybody, this is Gary Vaynerchuk.

62
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:19,632
Episode 264 of the #AskGaryVee Show

63
00:02:21,145 --> 00:02:23,245
[offscreen viewer speaking]-
I've developed product

64
00:02:23,245 --> 00:02:26,544
that's coming up on a
year now that transforms

65
00:02:26,544 --> 00:02:30,561
cremated remains into a glaze
for ceramic design objects.

66
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:33,369
- Tony, admit right now,
this is the greatest show

67
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:35,033
that you've ever been on. (laughter)

68
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:37,524
This guy took dead people
turning into glaze.

69
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,032
- This is kind of a new one for me.

70
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:41,349
- I've got a big idea.

71
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:43,629
- What are you going to do man?

72
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:45,169
You get to, you can figure out how

73
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:47,660
to pull yourself up without
that collapsing. I would...

74
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,206
♫ There's always gonna
be another mountain,

75
00:02:51,206 --> 00:02:52,535
♫ I'm always gonna (music
cut off by signal beep)

76
00:02:52,535 --> 00:02:54,017
(offscreen) - Let go.

77
00:02:54,017 --> 00:02:56,005
- Okay; you know me so well!
I was really going to try!

78
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:57,072
[Offscreen voice] -Don't
do this! (laughter)

79
00:02:57,072 --> 00:02:57,905
- How's it going?

80
00:02:57,905 --> 00:02:58,738
- It's good,

81
00:02:58,738 --> 00:02:59,571
- Are you doing some of the new stuff? Or?

82
00:02:59,571 --> 00:03:01,542
- Yeah. It's still finding that
cadence that will work out.

83
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:03,091
- Sure, take's time.

84
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:04,200
- I didn't realize

85
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,495
that we weren't editing
DailyVee yesterday.

86
00:03:06,495 --> 00:03:07,870
I'm in charge of everybody though.

87
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,827
I could have made somebody not busy.

88
00:03:09,827 --> 00:03:10,918
I could have decided...

89
00:03:10,918 --> 00:03:12,261
I just need to know--

90
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:14,432
and I know you were sick,
so it was a perfect storm.

91
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:16,815
The fact that we're back
and episode two is not...

92
00:03:16,815 --> 00:03:18,145
That's crazy.

93
00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:20,812
(hip hop music)

94
00:03:27,027 --> 00:03:30,664
- Yeah? Thank you so much. I
appreciate talking with you.

95
00:03:30,664 --> 00:03:31,974
- Sorry.

96
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:32,807
- No! Not at all.

97
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:35,474
(hip hop music)

98
00:03:36,308 --> 00:03:39,342
- Some crazy labs. I was like,
you got to see Gary, right?

99
00:03:39,342 --> 00:03:41,213
Just give this to him!

100
00:03:41,213 --> 00:03:42,148
- Dude, you have two
different colored eyes?

101
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:42,981
- Yeah.

102
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:43,857
- How the fuck did I
not notice that before?

103
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:44,998
Thank you, man.

104
00:03:44,998 --> 00:03:46,616
- He just rolled up on you like...

105
00:03:46,616 --> 00:03:48,249
- He was just waiting outside.
Then after he gave it to me

106
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:51,246
he runs up and says rrrrr! (laughter)

107
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:54,372
- Hey everybody. This is
Gary Vaynerchuk. Episode 265

108
00:03:54,372 --> 00:03:56,884
of the #AskGaryVee Show

109
00:03:56,884 --> 00:03:59,235
and the amount of music I have consumed

110
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:01,136
from the man who is sitting
across from me right now

111
00:04:01,136 --> 00:04:02,715
should be illegal.

112
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:04,115
When I was 18, John, this
is what I would play.

113
00:04:04,115 --> 00:04:08,282
I'm like, okay, I'm 18. And in
18 years I'm going to be 36.

114
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,423
That's young as shit. I have
my whole life in front of me.

115
00:04:12,423 --> 00:04:14,109
Everything I've just lived,

116
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:14,942
I have all that time in front of me

117
00:04:14,942 --> 00:04:16,375
and I'm still going to be 36.

118
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,714
Now I'm 41, and I'm like, okay,
I've lived this whole life,

119
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:23,917
okay in 41 I'm going to be 82.
Hmmmm, 82 is a little like...

120
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:25,039
Even with the game that
I've played my whole life

121
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:27,340
about doubling up my number

122
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,331
to make me realize how
much time I still had

123
00:04:29,331 --> 00:04:32,093
so fucking be patient, do the right thing,

124
00:04:32,093 --> 00:04:35,306
shortcuts kill you, like
do it right. I still do it.

125
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:36,179
Hey.

126
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:37,494
- Amazing, Brother.

127
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:38,519
- See you soon.

128
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,352
- That was fucking amazing.

129
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:40,185
- Take care of yourself. Yeah man.

130
00:04:40,185 --> 00:04:41,018
- Thank you

131
00:04:41,018 --> 00:04:43,098
- It's really good to see you.
I'm really rooting for you.

132
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:43,931
- Thanks, Bro.

133
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:44,764
- Yeah, man. Take care.

134
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:45,680
That was a lot of fun, good
episode. Give it to me.

135
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,816
Culture, attention.

136
00:04:47,816 --> 00:04:49,780
There's so many things
going on in the world

137
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,947
that are winning, but when
you can combine your interest

138
00:04:55,286 --> 00:04:57,728
with what's winning, you
attack it, and for me, hip hop

139
00:04:57,728 --> 00:04:59,342
is an interest of mine,

140
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:01,487
and then I attack the people that I know.

141
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:04,062
I know Russ is going to be
one of the biggest artists

142
00:05:04,062 --> 00:05:05,770
in the world in three or four years

143
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,126
and we start establishing a
relationship, paying forward,

144
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:09,030
I'm putting him on to get
as much for him as possible.

145
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,767
You build a real relationship;

146
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:12,770
you're not doing it to
expect something in return.

147
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,545
You do the right things,
the right things happen.

148
00:05:15,545 --> 00:05:16,378
- What's up?

149
00:05:16,378 --> 00:05:17,211
- What up, my man?

150
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:19,237
- Hello, gosh, just getting it, you know.

151
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:20,611
- I get it.

152
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,794
How's it going?

153
00:05:21,794 --> 00:05:23,354
- We haven't stopped. We haven't stopped.

154
00:05:23,354 --> 00:05:25,341
- I love it. It's going well?

155
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:27,655
- Things are going great, yeah. Yeah man,

156
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:29,001
it's exciting day; album's out. And now

157
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:33,396
what songs are people
relating to, talking about,

158
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:35,475
busting out, so--just
kind of sitting back,

159
00:05:35,475 --> 00:05:36,450
taking that all in.

160
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,613
- And just consuming, consuming
all the content and feedback

161
00:05:38,613 --> 00:05:40,037
on social?

162
00:05:40,037 --> 00:05:40,870
- That's it.

163
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,915
- Listen. Listen, I really
enjoyed our time together

164
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:43,794
the other day.

165
00:05:43,794 --> 00:05:45,825
- Yeah, same here. Thank you
so much for inviting me in

166
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:49,992
and um gosh, having the
#AskGaryVee Show, you kidding me?

167
00:05:51,543 --> 00:05:52,804
- Make's me happy, man.

168
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:54,517
- We're just rocking
right along, and you know

169
00:05:54,517 --> 00:05:56,477
it's all about awareness right now for us.

170
00:05:56,477 --> 00:05:57,651
- Of course.

171
00:05:57,651 --> 00:05:59,684
- As crowded as the
airwaves are, as you know,

172
00:05:59,684 --> 00:06:01,851
it's all about making sure

173
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:04,619
as many people as we can

174
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:06,394
know that we have a new product out there.

175
00:06:06,394 --> 00:06:07,839
That's the battle.

176
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,692
All right, brother, thank
you for all the support.

177
00:06:08,692 --> 00:06:09,525
- Take care.

178
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:10,358
- Talk to you soon.

179
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:11,191
- Good bye.

180
00:06:11,191 --> 00:06:12,661
Heading home, going into the weekend.

181
00:06:12,661 --> 00:06:13,719
Going garage sale-ing tomorrow

182
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:16,367
which is my favorite past
time, Sunday New York Jets,

183
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:20,136
Buffalo Bills, my official
DailyVee Jets prediction:

184
00:06:20,136 --> 00:06:22,886
Buffalo Bills 16, New York Jets 9

185
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:26,296
And that is my hope.
I mean I love my Jets.

186
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:29,241
I know people real fans
don't cheer for losses.

187
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:32,218
That is just not practical
or strategically correct.

188
00:06:32,218 --> 00:06:34,780
I'm hoping for, in a world

189
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,112
where there's big time
quarterbacks coming into the draft,

190
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:39,939
I'm hoping for a top
pick, the number one pick.

191
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:41,695
Lot of music in the air, right?

192
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:43,488
Just with Dustin; Russ stopped by.

193
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:45,283
The conversation I just had with Dustin

194
00:06:45,283 --> 00:06:46,995
was an entrepreneurial conversation.

195
00:06:46,995 --> 00:06:49,468
The conversation that
we had with Russ was an

196
00:06:49,468 --> 00:06:52,341
entrepreneurial conversation.
Entrepreneurship is oxygen

197
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:54,437
across everything,
regardless of what you do,

198
00:06:54,437 --> 00:06:55,961
you need to figure out

199
00:06:55,961 --> 00:06:58,039
how to get people to give a shit about it

200
00:06:58,039 --> 00:06:59,544
and then act on it. And no
matter what you're trying

201
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:03,032
to achieve, which is bring
awareness to hurricane relief,

202
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:05,708
or trying to sell your T-shirt brand,

203
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,102
respecting your audience,
bringing them value,

204
00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:10,357
and then delivering on that product.

205
00:07:10,357 --> 00:07:11,393
That's the part that people forget.

206
00:07:11,393 --> 00:07:13,537
That shirt can't be shitty.

207
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:17,012
Our media services can't
be shitty. That song, songs

208
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:20,100
can't be shitty. You
can do everything right,

209
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,449
but if the product is shitty you're dead.

210
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:26,498
And so that is the focus going
in to this weekend for me.

211
00:07:26,498 --> 00:07:28,598
You're consuming this early in the week.

212
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:30,829
So let that be the rest of your week.

213
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:32,042
And let's fucking get it.

214
00:07:32,042 --> 00:00:00,000
(music)
