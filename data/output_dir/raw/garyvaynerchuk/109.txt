1
00:00:00,153 --> 00:00:01,231
- Yo, what up everybody?

2
00:00:01,231 --> 00:00:03,056
Hope you're enjoying your
holiday as much as I am,

3
00:00:03,056 --> 00:00:06,233
family time, but wanted to
set up this next keynote.

4
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:08,544
Did this at the Nordic forum.

5
00:00:08,544 --> 00:00:09,950
Lot of new topics.

6
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,656
Went pretty deep with a bunch of people.

7
00:00:11,656 --> 00:00:13,156
Hope you enjoy it.

8
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:15,072
See you soon.

9
00:00:15,072 --> 00:00:17,655
(upbeat music)

10
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:24,898
(audience applauding)

11
00:00:30,258 --> 00:00:33,638
(Gary laughing)

12
00:00:33,638 --> 00:00:35,285
Thank you, Finland.

13
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,812
I'm super excited to be here.

14
00:00:37,812 --> 00:00:41,303
And really very honestly, I'd
like to get the Q&A portion

15
00:00:41,303 --> 00:00:42,823
of this pretty quickly.

16
00:00:42,823 --> 00:00:44,765
I wrote a book called #ASKGARYVEE

17
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:47,890
because I do believe
that these kind of events

18
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,652
are incredible and that
a lot of very smart

19
00:00:50,652 --> 00:00:54,376
and special people come and
pontificate and what have you,

20
00:00:54,376 --> 00:00:57,240
but the interaction is
the single greatest way

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,361
to get deep, instead of wide.

22
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:00,809
And I think at the end
of the day for everybody

23
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,516
that has decided to
come to this conference,

24
00:01:03,516 --> 00:01:05,287
there's tangible things we want.

25
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:06,343
There's something we want.

26
00:01:06,343 --> 00:01:08,033
And that's actually where I want to start.

27
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:09,663
Actually, you know what,
let's start with this.

28
00:01:09,663 --> 00:01:11,595
Before I go into this, by show of hands,

29
00:01:11,595 --> 00:01:14,578
how many people here have no idea who I am

30
00:01:14,578 --> 00:01:15,841
or anything about my spiel?

31
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:18,824
Tell the truth, raise them.

32
00:01:18,824 --> 00:01:21,913
That fucking hurts.
(audience laughs)

33
00:01:21,913 --> 00:01:24,850
Thank you, Finland,
I'll see you next time.

34
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,484
That's a tough way to start.

35
00:01:27,484 --> 00:01:29,872
I thought that was the
case and I understand why.

36
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:32,543
So I'm gonna spend a few minutes
giving you my background,

37
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:34,001
because I think it's the foundation

38
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:35,691
of what I want to bring here.

39
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:37,826
I did a lot of work on
the flight over here

40
00:01:37,826 --> 00:01:38,994
to understand the audience.

41
00:01:38,994 --> 00:01:41,558
I think a lot of times,
when I speak at conferences

42
00:01:41,558 --> 00:01:43,071
or other speakers speak,

43
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:46,893
we make some misdistinctions of B2B, B2C,

44
00:01:46,893 --> 00:01:48,264
things of that nature.

45
00:01:48,264 --> 00:01:50,932
And so understanding the
makeup of a lot of people

46
00:01:50,932 --> 00:01:53,155
in this audience and
understanding the landscape

47
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,964
of the social media
grid, the digital grid,

48
00:01:55,964 --> 00:01:58,211
I'm gonna try to factor
my talk very aggressively

49
00:01:58,211 --> 00:02:00,540
towards a little bit more
of a B2B environment.

50
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,701
It's interesting, as a
marketer and a business person,

51
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:06,823
so many people think when
they think about social media,

52
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:08,991
it's so much more in a B2C environment.

53
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:12,721
Yet GE, which is one
of our largest clients

54
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:16,819
of my firm Vayner Media, is
easily the happiest client

55
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:18,787
we have because at the end of the day,

56
00:02:18,787 --> 00:02:20,565
before I give you my background,

57
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:23,383
I want to set this up immediately,
which is the following.

58
00:02:23,383 --> 00:02:25,935
No matter what you do in this room,

59
00:02:25,935 --> 00:02:27,356
no matter what business you come from,

60
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:31,053
no matter what position you
hold within that organization,

61
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:32,805
whether you're a solo entrepreneur

62
00:02:32,805 --> 00:02:34,976
or work at a big organization,

63
00:02:34,976 --> 00:02:38,121
there's only one thing
that bounds us all together

64
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:38,954
in this room.

65
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:41,487
The number one thing from
a business perspective

66
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:45,491
that ties all of us together
in this room is quite simple.

67
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:48,553
At the end of the day,
before you tell me how great

68
00:02:48,553 --> 00:02:51,180
your SaaS product is, or your service,

69
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,049
or how delicious your wine is,

70
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:56,025
or how great you are if
you're building your brand,

71
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:59,790
no matter what, before you
get a chance to tell me

72
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,382
how great you are or it is or that is,

73
00:03:03,382 --> 00:03:06,155
you need somebody's attention.

74
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:08,944
The number one thing that
everybody here is battling on,

75
00:03:08,944 --> 00:03:11,975
the currency of business forever,

76
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:14,420
and everything, by the way, is attention.

77
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,955
And the biggest thing that
everybody in this room

78
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:18,711
is being affected, and this is worldwide,

79
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:21,320
whether I'm in Asia,
South America, the US.

80
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,281
Obviously the apps are slightly different.

81
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:26,110
The usage is different.

82
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,106
But the one thing that is common,

83
00:03:28,106 --> 00:03:29,651
the one thing that I
absolutely want to spend

84
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:32,889
the majority of my time on is
you're sitting in this room

85
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:35,962
and you do not understand the
slide that I have up there

86
00:03:35,962 --> 00:03:39,070
that says I day trade
attention and build businesses,

87
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,899
you are very vulnerable in the speed

88
00:03:41,899 --> 00:03:43,910
of which the market is changing.

89
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,151
If you do not understand
that if you are religious

90
00:03:47,151 --> 00:03:50,043
or emotional of where
you send your message,

91
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:52,778
whether that is print
or radio or television

92
00:03:52,778 --> 00:03:56,653
or conferences or direct
mail or Facebook, Twitter,

93
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:00,510
Snapchat or Tumblr, if you are emotional,

94
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,632
if you draw lines in the sand,

95
00:04:02,632 --> 00:04:05,703
if you talk about how you used to do it

96
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,044
or how your grandfather built the business

97
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:09,816
or what is tried and true,

98
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:14,149
in a 2017 world, you are
massively vulnerable.

99
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:16,701
The speed in which our consumers,

100
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:18,767
whether in a B2B or B2C environment,

101
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:22,630
are switching and moving
has never been faster.

102
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,069
And listen, I stand in front of you,

103
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:27,524
I know Dick Costolo's here,
the former CEO of Twitter,

104
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:30,082
I saw him backstage, a
very good friend of mine.

105
00:04:30,082 --> 00:04:33,417
My breakout in the States was Twitter.

106
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:35,603
I was one of the first
movers on that platform.

107
00:04:35,603 --> 00:04:38,850
I amassed a million followers on Twitter.

108
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,783
I would wish and want
that Twitter was still

109
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:44,444
the number one place that
everyone spent all their time on.

110
00:04:44,444 --> 00:04:46,267
I was on the top of the heap.

111
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:49,278
But as it started getting
competition from Instagram

112
00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:51,552
and Snapchat and other platforms,

113
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:54,975
and as the attention was not
as deeply in that platform,

114
00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:56,725
it hurt my feelings.

115
00:04:56,725 --> 00:05:01,104
I wasn't excited that I spent
all of 2007 through 2010,

116
00:05:01,104 --> 00:05:04,748
eight fucking hours a
day replying to people

117
00:05:04,748 --> 00:05:06,841
of what wine goes with fish.

118
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:09,375
(audience laughs)

119
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,825
Every day, eight hours
a day, to build a base.

120
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:15,966
I wasn't excited that people
were moving away from it.

121
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:18,511
I just knew that I had no choice,

122
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:20,004
that that was the punchline.

123
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:23,195
That as much as you'd
like it to be the way

124
00:05:23,195 --> 00:05:25,192
that it most benefits you,

125
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:28,108
the end consumer does other stuff.

126
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:30,259
And so that's basically
been the story of my life.

127
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:33,535
My life starts in being born in Belarus

128
00:05:33,535 --> 00:05:35,001
in the former Soviet Union.

129
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,697
I came tot he US when
I was three years old.

130
00:05:37,697 --> 00:05:39,705
We were very, very, very poor.

131
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:42,454
I lived in a studio apartment
with eight family members,

132
00:05:42,454 --> 00:05:45,489
a third of the size of
the stage I'm on now.

133
00:05:45,489 --> 00:05:47,857
And my dad and my mom, as you can imagine,

134
00:05:47,857 --> 00:05:49,385
are very much my heroes.

135
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:51,369
My dad worked every hour of his life,

136
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:54,561
being a stock boy in a liquor store.

137
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:57,329
Actually, how many people
in this room are immigrants

138
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:59,105
or children of immigrants?

139
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:00,299
Please raise your hand.

140
00:06:00,299 --> 00:06:01,564
Just curious.

141
00:06:01,564 --> 00:06:03,335
So for the hands that are in this room,

142
00:06:03,335 --> 00:06:06,002
they know something I know, which is

143
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:08,137
immigrants have an amazing advantage.

144
00:06:08,137 --> 00:06:11,096
They have a very tried and true strategy

145
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:12,708
that we could all learn from.

146
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,257
What immigrants are very good at doing is

147
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:17,073
when they come to a new country,

148
00:06:17,073 --> 00:06:20,312
they work and they don't spend any money

149
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:22,479
on dumb shit for 10 years.

150
00:06:25,155 --> 00:06:27,019
And so that's what my parents did.

151
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:31,692
And eventually my dad was able
to buy a small liquor store

152
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:32,674
in New Jersey.

153
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:34,599
I was a very entrepreneurial kid.

154
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:37,024
I was day trading
attention from a young age.

155
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:40,571
I had six lemonade stands
when I was seven years old

156
00:06:40,571 --> 00:06:43,059
and I would spend all my
time trying to figure out

157
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:45,563
what tree and what pole
to put the signs on,

158
00:06:45,563 --> 00:06:47,900
because I was watching people drive

159
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,007
and trying to figure out what signs.

160
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:52,007
I was a very sick child.

161
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,629
When I was 12 and 13, I
was selling baseball cards,

162
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:59,173
which were very popular in
the United States at the time.

163
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:01,482
And I was making one to $2,000 a weekend

164
00:07:01,482 --> 00:07:03,967
selling them in the malls of New Jersey,

165
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:06,199
which was great and I
was rich for a young kid,

166
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,410
and it was fantastic.

167
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,795
But then my career changed.

168
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,089
My dad dragged me into the liquor store.

169
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:13,916
And I hated it at first,
but luckily I realized

170
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,805
that people collected wine.

171
00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:18,186
I was into collecting sports memorabilia.

172
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:20,482
That was my passion,
that was the connection.

173
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,252
And I decided that I was going to jump

174
00:07:22,252 --> 00:07:23,495
into my family business,

175
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:26,470
open up 4,000 liquor
stores across America,

176
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,732
sell the franchise one day,

177
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:31,518
and buy the New York Jets
American football team,

178
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,360
because that is my dream.

179
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,351
You two stand up, you two stand up.

180
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:37,155
Let's clap it up for these guys.

181
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:40,322
(audience applauding)

182
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,988
In 1994, I was in my dorm room in college.

183
00:07:43,988 --> 00:07:45,422
My friend came over to me,

184
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:47,011
and I wanna start wrapping this up

185
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:48,744
and getting into what matters to you.

186
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:49,892
He brought me into a room.

187
00:07:49,892 --> 00:07:52,991
It was the first time I heard
(mimicking an old modem),

188
00:07:52,991 --> 00:07:54,242
which was the internet.

189
00:07:54,242 --> 00:07:55,770
I was very excited about it.

190
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,846
I didn't know what it was.

191
00:07:56,846 --> 00:07:57,853
I said something stupid like,

192
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:00,752
"Is this the information superhighway?"

193
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:01,841
I looked at it.

194
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:04,335
This is, you know, there's
a lot of youngsters in here.

195
00:08:04,335 --> 00:08:05,418
This is 1994.

196
00:08:06,429 --> 00:08:09,709
I literally stood there and
watched people on the internet

197
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:11,291
for five hours.

198
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,187
It was that crazy.

199
00:08:13,187 --> 00:08:16,566
It was just that insane, it was so new.

200
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:20,190
And when I finally had
my turn to go on there,

201
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,568
when I finally had my turn to go on there,

202
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:25,604
within 20 minutes, I
landed on a message board

203
00:08:25,604 --> 00:08:29,502
where people were trading and
buying cards, baseball cards.

204
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:33,433
And I realized, my God, I can
do business on this thing.

205
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:35,997
And over the next year, I went head first

206
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:37,527
and learned about eBay,

207
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:39,624
learned about what was going on in Amazon,

208
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:42,201
started learning the
early internet culture.

209
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:45,602
And in 1996, I launched winelibrary.com,

210
00:08:45,602 --> 00:08:50,324
one of the first two e-commerce
wine businesses in America.

211
00:08:50,324 --> 00:08:53,572
From 1998 to 2003, in a five-year window,

212
00:08:53,572 --> 00:08:55,069
I grew my dad's business from a three

213
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:59,049
to a $60 million business on
very, very important terms

214
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:00,862
that matter to this entire room.

215
00:09:00,862 --> 00:09:01,849
I had no money.

216
00:09:01,849 --> 00:09:04,782
It was a $3 million business
that had 10% gross profit,

217
00:09:04,782 --> 00:09:06,865
$300,000 before expenses.

218
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,107
There was no marketing budget.

219
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:12,810
What I needed is to make every
penny work like a dollar.

220
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,544
So the strategy became
day trading attention.

221
00:09:15,544 --> 00:09:17,507
When you day trade attention, my friends,

222
00:09:17,507 --> 00:09:18,515
here's what you do.

223
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:21,805
You don't overspend on
what everybody believes

224
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:22,835
is tried and true.

225
00:09:22,835 --> 00:09:26,458
Every single company in this
gorgeous conference right now

226
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,186
is grossly overspending money on things

227
00:09:29,186 --> 00:09:31,428
that they've been doing
for the last decade,

228
00:09:31,428 --> 00:09:33,288
'cause it's the things they accept,

229
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:35,774
or the reporting justifies it,

230
00:09:35,774 --> 00:09:37,947
or they're just lazy to try something new.

231
00:09:37,947 --> 00:09:39,652
Everyone, everyone.

232
00:09:39,652 --> 00:09:41,779
And so what you do when
you day trade attention

233
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:43,652
is you have to find angles.

234
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:45,140
What's underpriced?

235
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,659
How many people here do email marketing

236
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:50,133
or have done email
marketing in their lives?

237
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:51,753
Raise your hands.

238
00:09:51,753 --> 00:09:53,379
Perfect, a lot of you.

239
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:56,216
In 1997, I started an email newsletter.

240
00:09:56,216 --> 00:09:58,331
Most people that came into my liquor store

241
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,679
didn't even know what email was in 1997.

242
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,444
I collected, I collected, I collected.

243
00:10:02,444 --> 00:10:06,390
And in 1998, I had a
200,000-person email newsletter

244
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,473
with 91% open rates.

245
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:13,009
Now it's not because I was a genius.

246
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:14,764
And I know a lot of you
sit here, just like I do,

247
00:10:14,764 --> 00:10:19,019
with emails that are 13
to 23% open rates today.

248
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,412
It's that in 1997, nobody was emailing.

249
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:24,737
We hadn't ruined it yet.

250
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:25,785
One thing I promise you,

251
00:10:25,785 --> 00:10:27,805
more than I know that the
sun will come up tomorrow,

252
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:30,972
I know that marketers ruin everything.

253
00:10:32,203 --> 00:10:33,535
We ruined the internet,

254
00:10:33,535 --> 00:10:35,899
I'm trying to ruin Snapchat
and Music.ly right now.

255
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:37,932
We ruin shit, it's what we do.

256
00:10:37,932 --> 00:10:40,362
So it was 91% open rates there.

257
00:10:40,362 --> 00:10:42,898
Then Google AdWords came out.

258
00:10:42,898 --> 00:10:44,877
I bought the word wine on Google AdWords

259
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:48,198
for five cents a click and
owned it for nine months

260
00:10:48,198 --> 00:10:50,361
before anybody bid me up.

261
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:52,506
Because people were still on Yahoo,

262
00:10:52,506 --> 00:10:55,360
and AskJeeves, and other shit like that.

263
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,862
So that became the rinse and repeat.

264
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:02,619
As I think about B2B
players in this environment,

265
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:05,767
it is stunning to me how
many B2B businesses here

266
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:07,671
do not understand that producing articles

267
00:11:07,671 --> 00:11:09,921
on Medium.com, on LinkedIn,

268
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:14,444
writing full content on
Facebook on your feed

269
00:11:14,444 --> 00:11:17,198
and then spending $100 in ads

270
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:19,865
against employees of the company

271
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,119
that you're trying to reach.

272
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:24,439
Let me say that three more times,

273
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:26,485
because the one thing I promised myself

274
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,583
as I boarded last night
in New York to get here is

275
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,047
I'm gonna give my talk.

276
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:32,877
But I'm gonna give every
single person in this audience

277
00:11:32,877 --> 00:11:34,333
one thing to take home to do,

278
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,809
and then email and say thank you.

279
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:38,596
So let me say it really slow.

280
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:42,013
Right now, on this day, October 6, right?

281
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,036
Is that right?

282
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,119
October 6, 2016, the number one deal,

283
00:11:47,986 --> 00:11:50,310
if you day trade attention like I do,

284
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,629
in this market is Facebook ads.

285
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,561
They are underpriced.

286
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:58,616
They are underpriced, because
a lot of people in this room

287
00:11:58,616 --> 00:12:01,201
still debate what the ROI is.

288
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:05,467
Or even worse, they're emotional
that Facebook organic reach

289
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:08,548
has come down and now
they have to pay for it.

290
00:12:08,548 --> 00:12:10,604
While you're emotional and sad

291
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,313
that you don't reach as many things,

292
00:12:12,313 --> 00:12:15,954
the best ad product that I've
seen since Google AdWords

293
00:12:15,954 --> 00:12:16,864
has emerged.

294
00:12:16,864 --> 00:12:19,981
Or even worse than both
of those two scenarios,

295
00:12:19,981 --> 00:12:22,141
you haven't even done it yet.

296
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,284
You've decided for your business,

297
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:26,566
your customer's not on that platform,

298
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:29,087
yet you've never spent a dollar testing it

299
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:31,683
to know if that's true or not.

300
00:12:31,683 --> 00:12:33,376
You've read a headline,

301
00:12:33,376 --> 00:12:35,201
you had a friend tell you,

302
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:37,987
but you don't actually do
it, and you're not sure.

303
00:12:37,987 --> 00:12:41,283
We live in a world right
now of headline readers.

304
00:12:41,283 --> 00:12:44,681
Everybody here has a lot
of opinions about Facebook

305
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,683
and Snapchat and Instagram and Influencer,

306
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,023
LinkedIn and Medium.

307
00:12:48,023 --> 00:12:50,261
But there's very few practitioners.

308
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:53,520
There's very few people that
have actually placed the ads.

309
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,442
There are very few people that understand

310
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,630
that the creative is the
variable when you place an ad.

311
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,796
And just because you
did it once doesn't mean

312
00:13:00,796 --> 00:13:01,950
that it doesn't work.

313
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,778
It might mean that the creative,

314
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:08,083
the video and the picture
that you put out, just sucked.

315
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:11,974
And so, as I go through
all the other things,

316
00:13:11,974 --> 00:13:14,096
just in the middle here for a few minutes,

317
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:16,803
I just wanna tell you exactly what I know.

318
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:18,931
What I know is I'm involved with 15

319
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,112
different B2B businesses right now.

320
00:13:21,112 --> 00:13:22,474
GE is a client.

321
00:13:22,474 --> 00:13:24,233
AT&T is a client.

322
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:26,858
But many start-ups that I
invest in because I also

323
00:13:26,858 --> 00:13:30,677
in my mid-2000s started
investing in Twitter,

324
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,447
Facebook, Tumblr, Uber.

325
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:34,079
I've done very well in that world.

326
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,350
I basically just told you that to brag.

327
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,162
That had no information value.

328
00:13:39,162 --> 00:13:42,432
But what I know about
these B2B businesses is

329
00:13:42,432 --> 00:13:44,286
right now every single person here

330
00:13:44,286 --> 00:13:46,968
can write an article about their expertise

331
00:13:46,968 --> 00:13:48,804
in the business that they're in.

332
00:13:48,804 --> 00:13:53,047
Not a propaganda for your
SaaS product or service,

333
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:55,656
but an article that would be valuable

334
00:13:55,656 --> 00:13:58,181
to the people that you're trying to reach.

335
00:13:58,181 --> 00:14:01,662
You can write this article
literally in a Facebook post,

336
00:14:01,662 --> 00:14:03,569
literally in a Facebook post.

337
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:05,815
And then you can go to the ad product

338
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:10,058
and you can actually target employees of,

339
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,723
one of the ways you can target on Facebook

340
00:14:12,723 --> 00:14:14,890
is the employees of an organization.

341
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,603
How many people here are
in B2B, raise your hand.

342
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:21,441
Higher, go high for me
Helsinki, higher again.

343
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:24,641
Show me again, I need to look, high.

344
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:25,474
Perfect.

345
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,542
A shitload, a lot of you.

346
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:33,496
All of you, all of you need to hear this.

347
00:14:33,496 --> 00:14:36,928
This is the remarkable era
of underpriced opportunity

348
00:14:36,928 --> 00:14:38,582
in digital and social marketing,

349
00:14:38,582 --> 00:14:42,982
yet I'm empathetic to why most
of you do not believe that.

350
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,135
I get it.

351
00:14:44,135 --> 00:14:46,279
Most of the advice,
most of the conferences,

352
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:49,638
most of the articles position
this in a B2C environment.

353
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,601
I know, for example, the following,

354
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:53,567
that if I was to buy
one of your companies,

355
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:55,671
the number one thing I
would do is the following.

356
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:58,121
Every one of you are in an industry

357
00:14:58,121 --> 00:15:01,617
where there is a B2B magazine
that is the number one thing

358
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:03,781
that the people in your market read.

359
00:15:03,781 --> 00:15:06,417
If you are a company
trying to reach customers,

360
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:09,025
I would become that magazine.

361
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:10,146
Let me explain.

362
00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:12,542
The other religious point
of view that this room needs

363
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:15,093
to take away from this talk this weekend,

364
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:17,916
or at some point you will
believe this is true,

365
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,999
whether it is today or
12 or 24 months from now,

366
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:24,803
36 months from now, is the following.

367
00:15:24,803 --> 00:15:27,582
The quicker everybody
in this room understands

368
00:15:27,582 --> 00:15:32,293
that they are a media company,
comma, software company,

369
00:15:32,293 --> 00:15:36,038
comma, wine retailer, comma, lawyer,

370
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:39,207
comma, account service provider,

371
00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:41,541
the quicker everybody
in this room understands

372
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:45,755
that they are a media
company, comma, those things,

373
00:15:45,755 --> 00:15:47,383
the quicker you will be successful.

374
00:15:47,383 --> 00:15:49,364
I will tell you why.

375
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:52,107
You told me that earlier
they said the ad was dead.

376
00:15:52,107 --> 00:15:54,822
You said the ad has gotta
be creative and good,

377
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:55,882
give it to the creatives.

378
00:15:55,882 --> 00:15:58,933
I believe more in your world
and I'll just add to it.

379
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:01,100
The ad has to bring value.

380
00:16:02,942 --> 00:16:05,279
The number one thing
that's happening in society

381
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,926
in every part of the
world is the following.

382
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:10,842
We as human beings, no
matter where we're from,

383
00:16:10,842 --> 00:16:14,784
we value health, we wanna
stay alive and the people,

384
00:16:14,784 --> 00:16:17,075
money, you like money.

385
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:21,205
But the number one
emerging thing in society

386
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:22,622
in value is time.

387
00:16:23,846 --> 00:16:26,423
Time is exploding in value to us

388
00:16:26,423 --> 00:16:30,796
because we all now live
in a 24/7, 365 world.

389
00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:32,525
Some of the old-timers in this room,

390
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:35,582
remember when the work day
ended and it just ended?

391
00:16:35,582 --> 00:16:37,158
It wasn't getting emails at night,

392
00:16:37,158 --> 00:16:38,807
people expecting you to reply.

393
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:40,574
We now live in a 24/7 world.

394
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:41,960
As a matter of fact, one
of the great mistakes

395
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,024
of my investing career is Travis
Kalanick, the CEO of Uber,

396
00:16:46,024 --> 00:16:47,718
who's a very good friend of mine,

397
00:16:47,718 --> 00:16:51,620
I passed on investing in Uber
in the angel round twice.

398
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,796
I cost myself hundreds
of millions of dollars.

399
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:57,340
I'm very upset about it.

400
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,105
But I invested a little bit later on,

401
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:03,802
not because Uber was doing so well,

402
00:17:03,802 --> 00:17:06,477
but because I realized
when he came to New York,

403
00:17:06,477 --> 00:17:08,921
and my brother AJ took
the first Uber ride,

404
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:12,126
oh my God, Uber doesn't
sell transportation.

405
00:17:12,126 --> 00:17:13,459
Uber sells time.

406
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:17,795
We don't care about
privacy, we care about time.

407
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:19,558
This is who we are as humans.

408
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:22,810
And what advertising is
doing in the last 50 years

409
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:26,186
is it's stopping you from
doing what you want to do

410
00:17:26,186 --> 00:17:28,002
and it's selling you something,

411
00:17:28,002 --> 00:17:30,758
which means by nature it
is stealing your time.

412
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,422
Which is why the second you decide

413
00:17:32,422 --> 00:17:36,069
that you're a media company
and you actually want to bring

414
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:39,722
people value, instead of
selling them something, you win.

415
00:17:39,722 --> 00:17:42,869
If you run home now and
misunderstood what I said,

416
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:45,448
which is why I'm creating
clarity right now for you,

417
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:49,789
if you leave here and
misunderstood what I said,

418
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:52,419
you will go home, you
will make a Facebook post,

419
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:56,108
and you will write a
propaganda or sales post

420
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,957
and you will push it and
it will not be successful.

421
00:17:58,957 --> 00:18:01,956
If you heard me loud
and clear and understand

422
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:04,905
who you're trying to reach
and you write an article

423
00:18:04,905 --> 00:18:08,400
about something that brings
them value, you will win.

424
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,948
For example, a small
business in the United States

425
00:18:10,948 --> 00:18:13,173
that heard this talk
three years ago from me

426
00:18:13,173 --> 00:18:16,586
started writing content about golf.

427
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:18,246
They were a law firm.

428
00:18:18,246 --> 00:18:20,209
But what they understood was
the people they were trying

429
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:22,874
to reach were into golf.

430
00:18:22,874 --> 00:18:25,669
And they started writing
content about golf

431
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:28,097
and used that content as a gateway drug

432
00:18:28,097 --> 00:18:29,847
to close the clients.

433
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:34,747
Because people don't want
to read your sales pitch.

434
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,631
They don't have time.

435
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:38,435
People want to read
something that brings value.

436
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:40,733
And the interesting thing
about so many of you

437
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:43,952
in the B2B environment is
you're actually an expert

438
00:18:43,952 --> 00:18:46,299
or knowledgeable about your craft.

439
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:47,835
You actually know.

440
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:51,577
And so putting that content to
work is massively important.

441
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:54,308
It was super important for
me six, seven years ago.

442
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:57,580
That was nothing compared
to the ability of going

443
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,035
and now targeting the
employees of the organization

444
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:03,237
that you're trying to reach.

445
00:19:03,237 --> 00:19:07,012
For example, if you're
trying to reach the CTO

446
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,353
or the CIO, or if you
actually know the title

447
00:19:10,353 --> 00:19:11,810
of the person you're trying to reach,

448
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,730
you are able to make a video on Facebook

449
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,537
that shows the value prop of your product.

450
00:19:17,537 --> 00:19:19,971
You're able to then in the copy say,

451
00:19:19,971 --> 00:19:22,072
"Does your CIO know?"

452
00:19:22,072 --> 00:19:24,717
You're then able to run $100 worth of ads

453
00:19:24,717 --> 00:19:26,565
against the employees
of that organization.

454
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,629
And then 20 people from that organization

455
00:19:28,629 --> 00:19:31,392
are going to take that post and forward it

456
00:19:31,392 --> 00:19:34,259
to the CIO, the CTO, the head of finance,

457
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:35,565
or whoever you're trying to reach.

458
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:38,727
My friends, I've spent the
last seven minutes here

459
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:40,554
on this rant.

460
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,387
And I understand it's very tactical

461
00:19:42,387 --> 00:19:45,387
and it's not motivational and funny.

462
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:48,431
But I fucking promise you

463
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:51,138
that if you really understand
what I'm talking about,

464
00:19:51,138 --> 00:19:54,006
you will do what you actually care to do,

465
00:19:54,006 --> 00:19:55,864
which is sell shit.

466
00:19:55,864 --> 00:19:57,260
Right?

467
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,753
We're running businesses here.

468
00:19:58,753 --> 00:20:00,567
So please, please understand that.

469
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:03,653
Because once you understand
what I just spent my time on,

470
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:06,411
how that works, you'll
start understanding why

471
00:20:06,411 --> 00:20:10,348
every company here needs
to hire an editor-in-chief.

472
00:20:10,348 --> 00:20:13,174
An editor-in-chief for your
SaaS business, your law firm.

473
00:20:13,174 --> 00:20:14,843
An editor-in-chief, it's crazy.

474
00:20:14,843 --> 00:20:16,576
It's not something any of you would think,

475
00:20:16,576 --> 00:20:17,649
and I understand why.

476
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:20,705
But you have to understand
the playing field is changing.

477
00:20:20,705 --> 00:20:21,817
And it's changing fast.

478
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:24,214
In America, I run Vayner Media.

479
00:20:24,214 --> 00:20:27,983
We're an 800-person firm,
$100 million in revenue,

480
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:30,342
in four years from zero, basically.

481
00:20:30,342 --> 00:20:33,915
We work with GE and Pepsi and Under Armor

482
00:20:33,915 --> 00:20:36,991
and Toyota and the biggest
brands in the world.

483
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,655
And in the US, my clients spend
tens of billions of dollars

484
00:20:41,655 --> 00:20:44,102
trying to sell stuff.

485
00:20:44,102 --> 00:20:46,156
Here's how they do it.

486
00:20:46,156 --> 00:20:48,133
By show of hands in this room,

487
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:50,573
how many of you now watch television,

488
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:53,486
not when the show airs, but on TiVo,

489
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,421
Netflix, DVR, or Amazon Prime,

490
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,450
whatever you have here on your time.

491
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,867
Raise your hands.

492
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:01,995
Oh interesting, everybody.

493
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:04,901
Everybody.

494
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:06,870
And I think we can agree
this is not 13-year-old girls

495
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,697
everywhere, right, everybody.

496
00:21:09,697 --> 00:21:11,483
And how many of you,
when given the chance,

497
00:21:11,483 --> 00:21:14,202
fast-forward every single commercial

498
00:21:14,202 --> 00:21:17,597
if you have the option of fast-forward?

499
00:21:17,597 --> 00:21:19,430
Miraculous, everybody.

500
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:23,033
Yet every company that is trying to reach

501
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:26,361
and sell you something
here in the Finland market

502
00:21:26,361 --> 00:21:28,941
is spending millions of dollars

503
00:21:28,941 --> 00:21:33,081
making 30-second videos to
put in between these shows

504
00:21:33,081 --> 00:21:34,026
to sell you something.

505
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:38,193
And even if miraculously that
video is put in front of you

506
00:21:39,116 --> 00:21:43,903
because you dropped your
remote control off the bed,

507
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:46,149
even if that miraculous thing happens,

508
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:48,273
the second a commercial comes,

509
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:51,356
every person in this room grabs this.

510
00:21:52,308 --> 00:21:54,377
And you look at this
and you check on work,

511
00:21:54,377 --> 00:21:56,846
or you tweet about what you just saw

512
00:21:56,846 --> 00:21:58,118
or you wanna see what other people said

513
00:21:58,118 --> 00:21:59,752
about what she was wearing.

514
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,113
But I promise you one thing.

515
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:02,804
Your attention,

516
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:05,135
your attention is not on that video.

517
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:08,243
You can sit with me for the
next 30 years of your life

518
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,118
and show me every report you have,

519
00:22:11,118 --> 00:22:13,630
your modeling mix, your data reports,

520
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,814
your big data, your surveys.

521
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:18,228
You can show me all your
report, but my friends,

522
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:19,737
it is time for the people in this room,

523
00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:22,519
and especially the
entrepreneurs in this room

524
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:27,020
to start deploying common
sense against this reality.

525
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,218
In America, the number
one thing that my clients

526
00:22:29,218 --> 00:22:33,725
spend money on is
programmatic banner ad buy-in.

527
00:22:33,725 --> 00:22:36,519
Banner ads across the whole web.

528
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:39,870
There's nobody in this room
that is looking at a banner ad.

529
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,375
Nobody is going to a website,

530
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,193
scrolling down to the
bottom left-hand corner,

531
00:22:44,193 --> 00:22:46,943
and carefully consuming a banner.

532
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,419
It's true.
(audience applauding)

533
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:54,577
It's true.

534
00:22:54,577 --> 00:22:59,015
And you clap, and you clap,
my friends, because you know.

535
00:22:59,015 --> 00:23:01,515
Yet many sell it, many buy it,

536
00:23:02,445 --> 00:23:04,240
because that's what humans do.

537
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,697
You do what's best for
you in the short term

538
00:23:06,697 --> 00:23:09,084
without understanding the
long-term implications.

539
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:11,724
We are living through a revolution.

540
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:15,141
This, my friends, this is the television.

541
00:23:16,517 --> 00:23:19,267
And the television is the radio.

542
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:23,000
And it's 1960 and there's
a huge opportunity

543
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,067
for everybody in this room.

544
00:23:25,067 --> 00:23:27,283
And you can sit and give excuses when I

545
00:23:27,283 --> 00:23:28,698
and Dick and Peter come up and say,

546
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,879
"Ah, but here in Finland it's different."

547
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:36,046
(audience laughing and applauding)

548
00:23:39,607 --> 00:23:40,884
You can say that.

549
00:23:40,884 --> 00:23:42,360
You're more than welcome.

550
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,151
But the reason you laughed and clapped

551
00:23:44,151 --> 00:23:46,068
is 'cause you know it's not.

552
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:48,030
I know it's not 'cause I look at the data.

553
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,268
I'm not emotional about it.

554
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:51,147
I don't care how reserved you are.

555
00:23:51,147 --> 00:23:53,501
I don't care how over the top I am.

556
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:55,047
This is just data.

557
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:58,122
Your consumers are living on this device.

558
00:23:58,122 --> 00:24:00,599
And when you sit and make another excuse,

559
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:02,331
"Yes, Gary, you're very interesting.

560
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:04,204
"You're a very interesting
speaker, this is good.

561
00:24:04,204 --> 00:24:07,977
"But my customer is not
on that, they're older."

562
00:24:07,977 --> 00:24:11,614
You're older.
(audience laughing)

563
00:24:11,614 --> 00:24:15,389
You're on it.
(audience applauding)

564
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:19,775
And so, I had a very big
advantage going into marketing.

565
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:21,629
Unlike many people,

566
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:24,108
and it's why I love the
speaker tomorrow, Seth Godin,

567
00:24:24,108 --> 00:24:26,418
who I enjoy so much,
and I'm sure you will.

568
00:24:26,418 --> 00:24:27,792
He actually built a business

569
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:29,757
before he became a marketing expert.

570
00:24:29,757 --> 00:24:32,128
I built businesses and sell stuff

571
00:24:32,128 --> 00:24:34,664
before I started a marketing firm.

572
00:24:34,664 --> 00:24:37,497
My big advantage is my KPI, my ROI

573
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:41,825
is not headlines and adage.

574
00:24:41,825 --> 00:24:45,742
It's not to win a award
in the south of France.

575
00:24:47,846 --> 00:24:51,459
My KPI and ROI is to sell something.

576
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:53,368
That's what businesses do.

577
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:56,702
And so I implore all of
you to take a hard look,

578
00:24:56,702 --> 00:24:58,264
because here's the punchline.

579
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:00,237
And I'm sure, I didn't get
to see what Peter said,

580
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:03,018
but I sure know how he rolls.

581
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:06,403
If you think about what
has happened in our society

582
00:25:06,403 --> 00:25:08,320
over the last 10 years,

583
00:25:09,191 --> 00:25:11,658
and this is worldwide,

584
00:25:11,658 --> 00:25:13,355
if you understand what's gonna happen

585
00:25:13,355 --> 00:25:16,410
over the next 10 years, it is remarkable.

586
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,321
As a matter of fact, this is
actually a very good question.

587
00:25:18,321 --> 00:25:21,703
How many people here are
retiring in the next 10 years?

588
00:25:21,703 --> 00:25:23,921
And I don't mean, before
you raise your hand,

589
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:27,815
I don't mean you're gonna
crush it and make lots of money

590
00:25:27,815 --> 00:25:29,481
and retire on a island.

591
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:32,515
I mean, you're old and you're finished.

592
00:25:32,515 --> 00:25:34,163
(audience laughing)

593
00:25:34,163 --> 00:25:36,818
Raise your hand if you're
retiring in the next 10 years.

594
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:40,249
One, two, three, four, five, six.

595
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:42,378
Okay, so for the nine of you,

596
00:25:42,378 --> 00:25:44,256
(audience laughing)

597
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:49,007
you could take some of what
I said with a grain of salt.

598
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:51,541
But for the rest of
you, please understand.

599
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:54,132
If you are not a practitioner,

600
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:56,887
whether you are the
CEO, the head of sales,

601
00:25:56,887 --> 00:25:58,315
or entry level in your career,

602
00:25:58,315 --> 00:26:00,901
if you don't understand
how this stuff works,

603
00:26:00,901 --> 00:26:03,806
if you've not signed up
for Instagram and Snapchat,

604
00:26:03,806 --> 00:26:05,369
this is not a waste of your time.

605
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:06,749
Think of it this way.

606
00:26:06,749 --> 00:26:08,704
We are running a marathon.

607
00:26:08,704 --> 00:26:10,494
And if you don't start
getting on the treadmill

608
00:26:10,494 --> 00:26:12,069
and getting ready for the marathon,

609
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:15,526
when the marathon comes,
you will not be able to run.

610
00:26:15,526 --> 00:26:16,633
You understand?

611
00:26:16,633 --> 00:26:19,403
So downloading these things
and understanding these things

612
00:26:19,403 --> 00:26:21,630
is not for fun or being cool.

613
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,068
It's gonna be the only game.

614
00:26:24,068 --> 00:26:25,922
What do you think is happening here?

615
00:26:25,922 --> 00:26:27,827
There are 60-year-old men in here

616
00:26:27,827 --> 00:26:31,283
who sent the poop emoji
in the last 24 hours.

617
00:26:31,283 --> 00:26:33,973
We're changing the way we communicate.

618
00:26:33,973 --> 00:26:35,784
There are people in this
room that 10 years ago said

619
00:26:35,784 --> 00:26:37,373
they would never get a cell phone

620
00:26:37,373 --> 00:26:39,928
'cause their pager was good enough.

621
00:26:39,928 --> 00:26:42,596
We are living through major, major,

622
00:26:42,596 --> 00:26:44,530
major communication shifts.

623
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,456
And it is gonna be expedential.

624
00:26:46,456 --> 00:26:48,642
We live in a mobile-only world.

625
00:26:48,642 --> 00:26:50,985
You just don't realize it yet.

626
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:53,122
It's here, it's happening.

627
00:26:53,122 --> 00:26:55,746
And whether Twitter becomes
big and then not big,

628
00:26:55,746 --> 00:26:59,854
whether Facebook's here in five
years or not, I don't care.

629
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:02,527
I don't care, Facebook,
Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram,

630
00:27:02,527 --> 00:27:04,970
Tumblr, Pinterest all disappear.

631
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,579
The concept of us consuming information

632
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:10,504
and making business decisions

633
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:13,631
and living our lives through this is here.

634
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,545
And then it will be here.

635
00:27:15,545 --> 00:27:16,585
And then it will be here.

636
00:27:16,585 --> 00:27:17,642
And then we'll be fucking robots.

637
00:27:17,642 --> 00:27:19,392
But now, but for now,

638
00:27:20,471 --> 00:27:22,388
but for now it is here.

639
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:26,594
And if your entire business
strategy is not about

640
00:27:26,594 --> 00:27:28,759
where people's attention is,

641
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:31,814
when you look at the data of
finish use on the internet

642
00:27:31,814 --> 00:27:35,074
today and on cell phone usage,

643
00:27:35,074 --> 00:27:37,770
when you look at your
customers in this country,

644
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,841
not in America, of the percentage of time

645
00:27:40,841 --> 00:27:44,155
that everybody in Finland
spends on a social network

646
00:27:44,155 --> 00:27:49,154
in a mobile device, it is up
to almost 50% of all usage.

647
00:27:49,154 --> 00:27:52,812
Only gaming and utility
apps are anywhere close.

648
00:27:52,812 --> 00:27:55,879
All of a sudden, the word social media,

649
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:58,310
instead of some little thing on the side,

650
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,756
a little sprinkle, a little nice-to-have,

651
00:28:00,756 --> 00:28:02,837
when you think the way I think,

652
00:28:02,837 --> 00:28:05,276
which this is the most
important device in the world,

653
00:28:05,276 --> 00:28:07,677
and more than half of our time, all of us,

654
00:28:07,677 --> 00:28:10,338
half of our time in this device is spent

655
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:15,292
on a social network, it becomes
a little more important.

656
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:18,560
I mean literally, guys, when
I go out tonight in Helsinki,

657
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,263
I would rather have
somebody come up to me,

658
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:23,796
stab me in the stomach with
a knife and steal my wallet

659
00:28:23,796 --> 00:28:25,379
than lose my phone.

660
00:28:27,276 --> 00:28:28,419
This is it.

661
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:31,600
How many people here in
every 24-hour window,

662
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,496
every 24-hour window, are in
arms' reach of their telephone?

663
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:36,829
Raise your hand.

664
00:28:37,889 --> 00:28:40,282
What do you think is happening?

665
00:28:40,282 --> 00:28:41,620
What do you think is happening?

666
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,115
You think your, like
who can't wait to leave

667
00:28:44,115 --> 00:28:46,517
this amazing conference, the
Nordic Business Conference,

668
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:49,048
go home, and go to their mailbox,

669
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:52,631
and carefully go through
their direct mail?

670
00:28:54,742 --> 00:28:56,945
I mean, what are we spending our money on?

671
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:58,937
How do you think you're getting customers?

672
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,060
It is time.

673
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,116
Listen, you could get away
with this bullshit in 2009

674
00:29:04,116 --> 00:29:05,972
and say it's not here.

675
00:29:05,972 --> 00:29:07,409
You could, you could,

676
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:09,969
when I was here at a
different conference in 2012,

677
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:12,517
you could say, eh, not yet.

678
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,283
My friends, it's 2017.

679
00:29:14,283 --> 00:29:15,898
The data's in place.

680
00:29:15,898 --> 00:29:17,146
You may not like it.

681
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:19,586
You may go out to dinner with your partner

682
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:21,784
and you may see two
people sitting at dinner

683
00:29:21,784 --> 00:29:24,117
and both of them are on a phone.

684
00:29:24,117 --> 00:29:27,113
And you may say, ah, look how sad that is.

685
00:29:27,113 --> 00:29:28,696
Technology, so sad.

686
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:31,115
You can do that.

687
00:29:31,115 --> 00:29:32,513
You many not like that this is happening.

688
00:29:32,513 --> 00:29:35,746
By the way, real quick, when
I see a couple at dinner

689
00:29:35,746 --> 00:29:37,609
and they're on the phone the whole time,

690
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,803
I don't think that's sad.

691
00:29:38,803 --> 00:29:40,288
I think it's amazing.

692
00:29:40,288 --> 00:29:41,612
Let me explain why.

693
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:44,566
That same couple, 15 years ago,

694
00:29:44,566 --> 00:29:46,995
they just sat across
from each other at dinner

695
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:48,949
and didn't say a fucking word.

696
00:29:48,949 --> 00:29:53,116
(audience laughing and applauding)

697
00:29:55,925 --> 00:29:57,801
Let me say one thing here for you.

698
00:29:57,801 --> 00:30:00,203
And this is a very good
thing for everybody

699
00:30:00,203 --> 00:30:01,339
to leave this conference with.

700
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:03,441
Technology is not changing us.

701
00:30:03,441 --> 00:30:07,024
Technology is exposing
who we actually are.

702
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,449
So all my friends, I have a
seven, four-year-old daughter.

703
00:30:10,449 --> 00:30:12,550
All my friends are like,
ugh, I hate that my kids

704
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,333
are on the iPad all day.

705
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,263
But the second the kid
cries when we're over

706
00:30:16,263 --> 00:30:19,181
and having drinks, they
throw the iPad at them

707
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:20,764
like it's medicine.

708
00:30:22,534 --> 00:30:24,828
So it's time for us all
to not be hypocrites.

709
00:30:24,828 --> 00:30:28,669
It is time for all of us
to understand it's 2017.

710
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:30,782
You may not like this.

711
00:30:30,782 --> 00:30:32,177
You may not like this.

712
00:30:32,177 --> 00:30:33,010
You know what I love?

713
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,957
I love how everybody has
decided writing a letter

714
00:30:35,957 --> 00:30:37,624
is so amazing.

715
00:30:37,624 --> 00:30:40,453
We decided in the world
that if you write a letter,

716
00:30:40,453 --> 00:30:42,674
that's some amazing achievement,

717
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,867
that you're the greatest
person of all time.

718
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:47,956
We have made the pencil
and paper on a pedestal.

719
00:30:47,956 --> 00:30:49,708
Yet if we text each other,

720
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:51,903
that seems like not communicating.

721
00:30:51,903 --> 00:30:53,840
Our kids are not communicating.

722
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,135
It's the same shit.

723
00:30:56,135 --> 00:30:59,758
It's the same shit, do you understand?

724
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:01,312
And the longer you hold out,

725
00:31:01,312 --> 00:31:04,352
and you want it to be 2002 and 1997

726
00:31:04,352 --> 00:31:08,051
and 1983, great, knock yourself out.

727
00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:10,206
But let me make you a promise.

728
00:31:10,206 --> 00:31:13,138
Technology will run you over.

729
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:16,966
Somebody who's smaller than
you will take your business,

730
00:31:16,966 --> 00:31:21,124
because the attention, the
attention of all of our consumers

731
00:31:21,124 --> 00:31:25,454
and all of age groups and
all demos and all countries

732
00:31:25,454 --> 00:31:26,787
in 2017 is here.

733
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:30,587
And when you understand what
people pay attention to here,

734
00:31:30,587 --> 00:31:32,890
it is Facebook, it is YouTube,

735
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:36,036
it is blogs, it is
LinkedIn, it is Twitter.

736
00:31:36,036 --> 00:31:38,534
And you better figure
out how you storytell

737
00:31:38,534 --> 00:31:40,255
and how you market on these platforms,

738
00:31:40,255 --> 00:31:43,884
because if you don't,
you will be finished.

739
00:31:43,884 --> 00:31:45,253
Thank you.

740
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:49,420
(audience applauding and cheering)

741
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:53,216
(upbeat music)

742
00:31:56,568 --> 00:31:57,904
Thank you.

743
00:31:57,904 --> 00:31:58,739
Thank you so much.

744
00:31:58,739 --> 00:31:59,822
- [Man] Gary!

745
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:07,457
What an amazing performance, my God.

746
00:32:07,457 --> 00:32:11,690
What a wake up call that
was, thank you so much.

747
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:12,523
Give him a hand one more time.
- And hold on, and hold on.

748
00:32:12,523 --> 00:32:14,856
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

749
00:32:16,064 --> 00:32:19,640
Is anybody else pissed off
like I am that it is 2016

750
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,706
and that needs to be a wake-up call?

751
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,327
- Unfortunately, that is the case.

752
00:32:23,327 --> 00:32:24,442
That is the case.

753
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,052
And it feels damn good to be awakened.

754
00:32:27,052 --> 00:32:28,682
- Good.
- Common sense.

755
00:32:28,682 --> 00:32:31,725
You know, but I do enjoy
going to southern France

756
00:32:31,725 --> 00:32:33,921
to pick up a prize once in a while.

757
00:32:33,921 --> 00:32:35,879
But you know that's--
- It feels good.

758
00:32:35,879 --> 00:32:37,589
- We've got a huge amount of questions.

759
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:40,589
I think the one that I want to use--

760
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,346
(man yelling in the audience)

761
00:32:45,346 --> 00:32:48,015
- I'll give you this perhaps if, yes,

762
00:32:48,015 --> 00:32:49,448
you changed your clothes.

763
00:32:49,448 --> 00:32:50,483
- [Antti] That's what I did.

764
00:32:50,483 --> 00:32:52,171
- You are so, what are you wearing?

765
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:53,522
Tell me that first, please.

766
00:32:53,522 --> 00:32:56,098
- He's wearing my favorite
football player's jersey.

767
00:32:56,098 --> 00:32:57,495
Al Toon was a Jet from 1984 to '88.

768
00:32:57,495 --> 00:33:00,290
- There you go.
- 1985 to '92.

769
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,179
- Yes.
- Look at this guy.

770
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:04,596
- Wide receiver, 6,605 yards.

771
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:08,328
- [Gary] What college did he go to?

772
00:33:08,328 --> 00:33:09,411
- Don't know.

773
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,002
- Wisconsin, all right,
let's do the questions,

774
00:33:12,002 --> 00:33:12,977
'cause I want to answer the question.

775
00:33:12,977 --> 00:33:14,121
Go ahead.
- Gary, uh,

776
00:33:14,121 --> 00:33:15,616
thanks for being here.

777
00:33:15,616 --> 00:33:17,187
My name is Antti Merilehto.

778
00:33:17,187 --> 00:33:19,361
Finch Filand is one of my companies.

779
00:33:19,361 --> 00:33:22,096
I do have a question
because I'm half immigrant.

780
00:33:22,096 --> 00:33:23,953
My wife, she's a coach in Boston

781
00:33:23,953 --> 00:33:26,057
so I spend half the time in Boston,

782
00:33:26,057 --> 00:33:27,626
half the time here.

783
00:33:27,626 --> 00:33:30,717
And I would say for me,
being in front of you,

784
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,075
all of you, wearing this strange clothing

785
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:34,297
for a business conference

786
00:33:34,297 --> 00:33:38,461
is more natural than for
many people around here.

787
00:33:38,461 --> 00:33:41,401
And, by the way, you're
on live on my Facebook.

788
00:33:41,401 --> 00:33:42,234
- [Gary] No problem.

789
00:33:42,234 --> 00:33:43,731
- [Man] And your question was?

790
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:47,540
- My question is, how can
you encourage these people,

791
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,549
Fins who are a bit
different, we're more shy,

792
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:53,541
to be here and day trade their attention

793
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:54,874
and like for me saying,

794
00:33:54,874 --> 00:33:58,120
if you have eCommerce, in other
words, I'm the guy to go to

795
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,053
if you spend more than 5K a month.

796
00:34:00,053 --> 00:34:02,970
How can people be, stand up, do it?

797
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:05,279
- [Gary] Yeah, I get it. I get it.

798
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,395
Look, I think, and I addressed it earlier,

799
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:11,324
listen, every culture
has it's own game, right.

800
00:34:11,324 --> 00:34:14,248
Like I don't think, I have no interest,

801
00:34:14,248 --> 00:34:17,454
and I definitely don't have
the audacity or the hypocrisy

802
00:34:17,454 --> 00:34:19,393
to come here and say be like me,

803
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:22,625
be crazy, wear a jersey from
a different football team

804
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:23,597
from a different country.

805
00:34:23,597 --> 00:34:26,902
Stand up, disrupt the entire conference.

806
00:34:26,902 --> 00:34:29,235
- He's a typical Finish guy.

807
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,735
- What I love about that is,

808
00:34:31,735 --> 00:34:34,172
that's real for you Antti,
that's real for you.

809
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,390
And you should do that.

810
00:34:35,391 --> 00:34:36,422
And for a lot of people here,

811
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:38,389
if you're introverted, for example,

812
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:40,904
the example I spent most of
my time on the talk today,

813
00:34:40,905 --> 00:34:43,572
it wasn't about being
crazy on video like I am.

814
00:34:43,572 --> 00:34:44,933
That's what I'm comfortable with.

815
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:47,083
Some people are just great writers.

816
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:50,266
Maybe you use SoundCloud and you do audio.

817
00:34:50,266 --> 00:34:53,629
Everybody here has to deploy
one very important thing,

818
00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:55,553
self-awareness.

819
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:57,376
You have to know who you are.

820
00:34:57,376 --> 00:34:59,611
You shouldn't be crazy because there's

821
00:34:59,611 --> 00:35:01,338
not a lot of crazy in Finland.

822
00:35:01,338 --> 00:35:03,559
You shouldn't be reserved or introverted

823
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,017
because that's what's expected.

824
00:35:05,017 --> 00:35:06,451
You need to be you.

825
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:07,530
And you need to be you,

826
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:08,824
and you need to be you.

827
00:35:08,824 --> 00:35:11,071
And once you get
comfortable with being you,

828
00:35:11,071 --> 00:35:13,517
it's unbelievable what starts happening.

829
00:35:13,517 --> 00:35:17,692
Now, whether it is through
written form, audio, video,

830
00:35:17,692 --> 00:35:19,659
you need to figure out the medium

831
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,818
that allows you to
communicate to the world

832
00:35:21,818 --> 00:35:24,052
and in which platforms here

833
00:35:24,052 --> 00:35:27,478
because you will very successful
if you can figure that out.

834
00:35:27,478 --> 00:35:30,304
By not talking, by not communicating

835
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:32,139
in the best form for you,

836
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:33,847
where people actually are,

837
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:35,880
you are leaving money, opportunity,

838
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,863
raising money for charities,

839
00:35:37,863 --> 00:35:40,181
whatever you want to
accomplish in your life,

840
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:41,478
you're leaving that on a table.

841
00:35:41,478 --> 00:35:43,385
So the punchline is self-awareness man.

842
00:35:43,385 --> 00:35:45,312
I'm not gonna tell them, go do this.

843
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:46,318
I don't know them.

844
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:47,179
I don't know you.

845
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:48,903
Do you. You know you.

846
00:35:48,903 --> 00:35:51,651
Stop being scared of who you are.

847
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:52,772
- [Man] Be yourself.

848
00:35:52,772 --> 00:35:55,025
(audience applause)

849
00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:58,316
Be yourself. Everybody else is taken.

850
00:35:58,316 --> 00:36:00,112
We know that one, I think it's so clear.

851
00:36:00,112 --> 00:36:03,648
We have one question, I'm
gonna take a digital question,

852
00:36:03,648 --> 00:36:04,944
I'll get back to you in a second.

853
00:36:04,944 --> 00:36:07,916
You know because you did tell
us that you were there before

854
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,525
everybody was on Yahoo,

855
00:36:09,525 --> 00:36:12,257
you were on Google before everybody else.

856
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:14,211
And this is a good question for you is,

857
00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:15,856
what's next on social media?

858
00:36:15,856 --> 00:36:17,582
Where are were going, you know?

859
00:36:17,582 --> 00:36:20,555
Where are we going wrong
and where should we be?

860
00:36:20,555 --> 00:36:22,003
- I have no idea.

861
00:36:22,003 --> 00:36:23,151
- [Man] Thank you.

862
00:36:23,151 --> 00:36:24,573
(audience laughs)

863
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:25,548
Next question please.

864
00:36:25,548 --> 00:36:27,721
- Now, I'll expand.
- I'm just kidding.

865
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:29,446
- But I think it's the truth.

866
00:36:29,446 --> 00:36:31,089
I think the biggest mistake people think,

867
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:32,516
and Seth gets it, I'm sure,

868
00:36:32,516 --> 00:36:34,086
and Peter gets it and all these great-

869
00:36:34,086 --> 00:36:37,116
we're not futurists, I'm
not Nostradamus, right.

870
00:36:37,116 --> 00:36:38,984
I don't know what's happening next.

871
00:36:38,984 --> 00:36:40,045
Here's what I know,

872
00:36:40,045 --> 00:36:43,683
I put in the work when
I see something pop.

873
00:36:43,683 --> 00:36:47,815
For the last eighth weeks on
the iTunes iStore, AppStore,

874
00:36:47,815 --> 00:36:49,841
there's an app called Marco Polo

875
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:51,775
that has been in the top 150

876
00:36:51,775 --> 00:36:53,050
so I downloaded it.

877
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,473
And I made my team download it.

878
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:57,202
And I watch people using it and I use it.

879
00:36:57,202 --> 00:36:58,510
I taste it.

880
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,009
And I'm not crippled.

881
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,854
You know, so many people here think,

882
00:37:01,854 --> 00:37:04,002
well that's a waste of time
if it doesn't become big.

883
00:37:04,002 --> 00:37:06,800
I think it's a big disadvantage
for you not to do it

884
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,294
in case it becomes big.

885
00:37:08,294 --> 00:37:11,376
So I play with Socialcam and Plurk

886
00:37:11,376 --> 00:37:13,234
and all these things
that nobody talks about.

887
00:37:13,234 --> 00:37:17,263
But I equally played with
Twitter and Facebook and Tumblr

888
00:37:17,263 --> 00:37:19,544
and Snapchat and Instagram.

889
00:37:19,544 --> 00:37:22,182
The key is, I don't know what's next

890
00:37:22,182 --> 00:37:24,232
but every time I see something

891
00:37:24,232 --> 00:37:25,837
that is happening a little bit,

892
00:37:25,837 --> 00:37:27,214
I put in the work.

893
00:37:27,214 --> 00:37:30,176
On Vine, when Vine was
popping two years ago,

894
00:37:30,176 --> 00:37:32,598
I stayed up from midnight to
two o'clock in the morning

895
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:33,643
'cause I was very busy.

896
00:37:33,643 --> 00:37:35,716
And I used it every night
and I watched everybody.

897
00:37:35,716 --> 00:37:37,967
I watch people behave.

898
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:39,714
I have one thing, I have one talent.

899
00:37:39,714 --> 00:37:41,225
I know what you're gonna do

900
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:42,749
before you know you're gonna do it.

901
00:37:42,749 --> 00:37:43,582
- [Man] That's a good talent.

902
00:37:43,582 --> 00:37:47,287
- And I do it by intuition
but also looking at the data.

903
00:37:47,287 --> 00:37:48,215
And also watching.

904
00:37:48,215 --> 00:37:49,961
And then watching what you do with it.

905
00:37:49,961 --> 00:37:52,316
So to me, I don't know what's next.

906
00:37:52,316 --> 00:37:54,818
I just know that the second
something pops a little bit,

907
00:37:54,818 --> 00:37:56,798
unlike most of you,

908
00:37:56,798 --> 00:38:00,635
I'm not scared to put in
the work to figure it out.

909
00:38:00,635 --> 00:38:02,154
- [Man] Yes. Great answer.

910
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,970
(audience applause)

911
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,156
We have another eager gentleman.

912
00:38:05,156 --> 00:38:06,524
Tell us who you are please.

913
00:38:06,524 --> 00:38:09,738
- Hey Gary, my name is Antti.

914
00:38:09,738 --> 00:38:11,770
Since the USC talk in 2015,

915
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,621
you've been like my digital uncle.

916
00:38:13,621 --> 00:38:15,710
Like you kinda answer all my questions.

917
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,095
- [Gary] Yo, why can't we be brothers?

918
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,416
What are you saying I'm old?

919
00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:20,432
- [Antti] You can be
my digital big brother.

920
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:21,265
- [Gary] Yes.

921
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,848
- [Antti] Alright.

922
00:38:22,848 --> 00:38:25,900
I was thinking, like, do I have
a question for Gary anymore

923
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,168
'cause you've answered so many questions

924
00:38:27,168 --> 00:38:28,366
but I've figured out.

925
00:38:28,366 --> 00:38:30,324
- [Gary] Okay.

926
00:38:30,324 --> 00:38:32,613
- Our company is gonna explode

927
00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:34,400
if we manage to scale our story.

928
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,233
- [Gary] Okay.

929
00:38:35,233 --> 00:38:37,176
- [Antti] And I'm gonna need
a lot of people for that.

930
00:38:37,176 --> 00:38:39,350
And let's put it this way,

931
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,574
I'm gonna get the money to scale

932
00:38:42,574 --> 00:38:44,544
from you or Seth or someone else.

933
00:38:44,544 --> 00:38:46,639
I think you should do it
because we're about time

934
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:48,000
and about attention.

935
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,833
- [Gary] Okay.

936
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:50,129
- But, so my question is,

937
00:38:50,129 --> 00:38:53,006
I come to the states
and I want Vayner Media

938
00:38:53,006 --> 00:38:54,454
to do our marketing there.

939
00:38:54,454 --> 00:38:55,287
- [Gary] Okay.

940
00:38:55,287 --> 00:38:58,111
But you have 800 people so
when I buy from Vayner Media

941
00:38:58,111 --> 00:39:00,092
I wanna buy what you know.

942
00:39:00,092 --> 00:39:02,992
So how have you managed
to scale the culture

943
00:39:02,992 --> 00:39:05,147
so that the person who's
handling my accounts

944
00:39:05,147 --> 00:39:07,387
is gonna be as good as you?

945
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:08,578
- [Gary] They're not.

946
00:39:08,578 --> 00:39:12,090
(audience laughs)

947
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,759
- [Antti] So its cheaper than
getting it straight from you?

948
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:17,070
- [Gary] Yes. I'm very expensive.

949
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,097
No, so here's the punchline.

950
00:39:19,097 --> 00:39:21,232
My challenge wasn't to hire people-

951
00:39:21,232 --> 00:39:23,819
listen, first of all,
anybody that's as good as me

952
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:27,826
would not work for me, let's
be very smart about this.

953
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:30,648
My job is not to make
you be able to buy me.

954
00:39:30,648 --> 00:39:33,866
My job is to make sure that
everybody in my company,

955
00:39:33,866 --> 00:39:35,856
when we have an account, is better

956
00:39:35,856 --> 00:39:38,104
than anything else you could buy.

957
00:39:38,104 --> 00:39:39,628
That's the game.

958
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:41,424
The game is not, me.

959
00:39:41,424 --> 00:39:42,323
Nobody buys me.

960
00:39:42,323 --> 00:39:44,008
I'm very up front with clients,

961
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:45,892
clients want to buy me and I explain,

962
00:39:45,892 --> 00:39:47,229
I'm a CO of the company,

963
00:39:47,229 --> 00:39:48,226
I run the company.

964
00:39:48,226 --> 00:39:49,637
I'm setting the vision.

965
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,446
I need to be working on Marco
Polo and understanding that.

966
00:39:52,446 --> 00:39:54,255
When I decided video for the phone

967
00:39:54,255 --> 00:39:55,913
was the most important
thing a few years ago,

968
00:39:55,913 --> 00:39:58,008
I was the one who hired
the first 20 people

969
00:39:58,008 --> 00:40:00,329
that would make video for the phone.

970
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:01,709
Those are the things I have to do.

971
00:40:01,709 --> 00:40:03,349
My game is not to do that.

972
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:05,774
My game is to create a culture internally

973
00:40:05,774 --> 00:40:09,082
of being better than the
alternative in the market place.

974
00:40:09,082 --> 00:40:10,375
- [Antti] Okay, so for a culture,

975
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,096
how do you chose the right people, one?

976
00:40:12,096 --> 00:40:13,750
And how do you make
sure they're good enough

977
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,111
when they, for example, become a manager-

978
00:40:16,111 --> 00:40:19,265
- [Gary] So I think the biggest
mistake people make here

979
00:40:19,265 --> 00:40:20,231
that are running businesses,

980
00:40:20,231 --> 00:40:22,520
is they are spending
too much time on hiring

981
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,318
and not enough strategy on firing.

982
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:26,651
So, I mean this,

983
00:40:27,649 --> 00:40:29,031
and I know it's a funny thing to say.

984
00:40:29,031 --> 00:40:31,913
I think I have unbelievable
emotional intelligence.

985
00:40:31,913 --> 00:40:32,932
It's my intuition.

986
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:34,117
I have great people skills.

987
00:40:34,117 --> 00:40:36,094
It's the thing I probably pride-

988
00:40:36,094 --> 00:40:38,532
you know this, it's the thing
I pride myself the most on.

989
00:40:38,532 --> 00:40:41,799
I am stunned how many times
I've been wrong hiring.

990
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:43,810
It's hard, it's hard.

991
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,890
So what I do now is I actually

992
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,526
don't spend any time on hiring.

993
00:40:47,526 --> 00:40:49,798
When I built Vayner Media, this time,

994
00:40:49,798 --> 00:40:53,155
from 30 to 200 people we
made happen in a year,

995
00:40:53,155 --> 00:40:54,811
I hired everybody.

996
00:40:54,811 --> 00:40:57,030
I mean, you could walk in and like say,

997
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,930
I don't have a computer,

998
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:00,374
I'm like, hired, you know.

999
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,962
I hired everybody because
when you're scaling,

1000
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:04,198
I need to taste it.

1001
00:41:04,198 --> 00:41:05,386
It's much like the apps,

1002
00:41:05,386 --> 00:41:07,063
I don't know what's next but I'll try it

1003
00:41:07,063 --> 00:41:08,098
and then I'll know.

1004
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,919
You don't know what you
have in an employee.

1005
00:41:09,919 --> 00:41:11,287
When you have to do is be upfront.

1006
00:41:11,287 --> 00:41:12,973
Hey John, you have to understand,

1007
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:15,359
I'm hiring quickly, I don't
know if you're gonna be good,

1008
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,517
but in three or four months,
if I don't think you're good,

1009
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:19,343
we're probably gonna let you go.

1010
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:20,403
And I wanna be up front with you

1011
00:41:20,403 --> 00:41:21,996
because you may not want on your resume

1012
00:41:21,996 --> 00:41:23,443
that you only worked here for three months

1013
00:41:23,443 --> 00:41:25,376
so you're taking a risk here too.

1014
00:41:25,376 --> 00:41:26,527
You have to be upfront.

1015
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:27,622
You have to a standup.

1016
00:41:27,622 --> 00:41:28,616
But that's my strategy.

1017
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:29,468
How do I know?

1018
00:41:29,468 --> 00:41:31,461
We hired, now we're at scale,

1019
00:41:31,461 --> 00:41:32,820
we know better what to look for

1020
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,140
but we're not always right.

1021
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,618
But the key is to make
sure people can't stay

1022
00:41:36,618 --> 00:41:40,546
in the system if they're not
qualified first, emotionally.

1023
00:41:40,546 --> 00:41:42,914
If you are not good with
the other boys and girls,

1024
00:41:42,914 --> 00:41:45,941
you are fired. Even if you're the best.

1025
00:41:45,941 --> 00:41:47,972
Second, meritocracy.

1026
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:50,359
You have to be good enough
to carry your weight

1027
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:53,886
because we're not running
a nonprofit either, got it?

1028
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,792
So, that's how.

1029
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:57,068
- Thank you very much.

1030
00:41:57,068 --> 00:41:58,145
(audience applause)

1031
00:41:58,145 --> 00:42:00,634
- [Annti] And this is the last
question, the biggest one.

1032
00:42:00,634 --> 00:42:02,670
Can I take you to dinner tonight?

1033
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,243
- [Gary] I can't do that
but it was great to see you.

1034
00:42:04,243 --> 00:42:05,437
- [Annti] Thank you so much.

1035
00:42:05,437 --> 00:42:06,972
- [Man] Listen, we know

1036
00:42:06,972 --> 00:42:09,328
we're talking about
advantages at this conference

1037
00:42:09,328 --> 00:42:11,412
and you know, Finland has

1038
00:42:11,412 --> 00:42:15,841
many advantages that you
probably have already seen

1039
00:42:15,841 --> 00:42:18,857
but we have some disadvantages
when it comes to wine.

1040
00:42:18,857 --> 00:42:21,256
You know, the weather is
not very good for wine.

1041
00:42:21,256 --> 00:42:23,942
But we do have great spirit.

1042
00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:25,902
- [Gary] Okay.
- Or great spirits.

1043
00:42:25,902 --> 00:42:28,319
And would you accept to taste

1044
00:42:30,827 --> 00:42:34,410
one of Finland's most
famous spirit for us?

1045
00:42:36,961 --> 00:42:38,875
- [Gary] Now?
- Yes, right now.

1046
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:41,226
- [Gary] Alright.
- Alright.

1047
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,576
Alka, would you come here please?

1048
00:42:43,576 --> 00:42:44,799
(audience claps)

1049
00:42:44,799 --> 00:42:46,708
This is a bit of a
taste test for you Gary,

1050
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:48,654
come on over here.

1051
00:42:48,654 --> 00:42:50,489
And this is a very special.

1052
00:42:50,489 --> 00:42:54,695
Alka is gonna pour you
something called Marskin ryyppy.

1053
00:42:54,695 --> 00:42:55,691
(audience laughs)

1054
00:42:55,691 --> 00:42:57,109
- [Gary] How are you?
- [Alka] I'm good and you?

1055
00:42:57,109 --> 00:42:59,958
- [Man] And there are two
questions related to this.

1056
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:01,692
It has to be filled to the
brim, is the tradition.

1057
00:43:01,692 --> 00:43:02,594
- [Alka] Yes.
- [Gary] Shit.

1058
00:43:02,594 --> 00:43:05,066
This is- I talked to you about this.

1059
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:08,147
It's Marshal Mannerheim, a great war hero,

1060
00:43:08,147 --> 00:43:10,002
a president of the republic,

1061
00:43:10,002 --> 00:43:12,699
had one of his staff invent this drink.

1062
00:43:12,699 --> 00:43:14,172
- Fuck.
(audience laughs)

1063
00:43:14,172 --> 00:43:16,593
- [Man] I want you to
tell us what you think.

1064
00:43:16,593 --> 00:43:18,887
But also it has three spirits in it.

1065
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,054
What are they?

1066
00:43:24,595 --> 00:43:27,304
- I'm only pounding this
'cause I love all of you.

1067
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:29,328
Alright, here we go.

1068
00:43:29,328 --> 00:43:31,119
L'chaim.
- [Man] L'chaim.

1069
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,483
Oh my god, give him a big hand.

1070
00:43:33,483 --> 00:43:35,660
(audience applause)

1071
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,726
You have become an honorary Finn.

1072
00:43:37,726 --> 00:43:39,976
What did you think of that?

1073
00:43:41,282 --> 00:43:43,068
What did you think of that?

1074
00:43:43,068 --> 00:43:44,520
Your commentary please.

1075
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,703
- I think I have more hair on my chest.

1076
00:43:46,703 --> 00:43:49,905
(audience laughs)

1077
00:43:49,905 --> 00:43:52,405
Um, not bad, not bad actually.

1078
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:58,397
Licorice. A little bit of almost,

1079
00:43:58,397 --> 00:44:01,490
do you know what pine tar is?

1080
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:03,361
So a little pine tar.

1081
00:44:03,361 --> 00:44:04,674
Eucalyptis.

1082
00:44:04,674 --> 00:44:05,757
- [Man] Okay.

1083
00:44:07,894 --> 00:44:08,889
- [Gary] And what's in it?

1084
00:44:08,889 --> 00:44:10,541
- [Man] Yes, what do you think?

1085
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:11,623
- You know-

1086
00:44:11,623 --> 00:44:14,371
- [Man] Very famous, you
know actually main stream-

1087
00:44:14,371 --> 00:44:17,704
- It's- to me it's got vodka, Sambuca...

1088
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:23,737
Yeah, I mean, vodka stands out for me.

1089
00:44:23,737 --> 00:44:24,612
- [Man] Yeah.

1090
00:44:24,612 --> 00:44:25,445
- Um...

1091
00:44:25,445 --> 00:44:27,078
- [Man] Good one, good one.

1092
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:28,680
- Maybe a little hint of gin.

1093
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,933
- [Man] Yes. Very good.

1094
00:44:30,933 --> 00:44:33,025
A hint of gin, a bit of vodka

1095
00:44:33,025 --> 00:44:34,940
or what we call vena in this country,

1096
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:35,843
but vermouth.

1097
00:44:35,843 --> 00:44:36,676
- Vermouth, got it.

1098
00:44:36,676 --> 00:44:38,575
- [Man] Give him a big
hand for trying that,

1099
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:39,895
give him a big hand.

1100
00:44:39,895 --> 00:44:42,963
(audience applause)
(Gary laughs)

1101
00:44:42,963 --> 00:44:46,084
How about taking, you know,
a question from these guys?

1102
00:44:46,084 --> 00:44:49,544
On this side, anybody want
to ask a question to Gary V?

1103
00:44:49,544 --> 00:44:50,989
Ask Gary V, #GaryV.

1104
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:52,278
- [Gary] Do you want me to answer this

1105
00:44:52,278 --> 00:44:53,111
while somebody's coming up?

1106
00:44:53,111 --> 00:44:54,092
- [Man] Oh, we have somebody over there.

1107
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:55,150
We have somebody who's-

1108
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,798
could you come up here and
catch this box for us please-

1109
00:44:57,798 --> 00:44:59,062
- I'm gonna answer this
while they're waiting.

1110
00:44:59,062 --> 00:45:00,660
It says, how do you prioritize your time-

1111
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,025
- That's my next one for you.

1112
00:45:02,025 --> 00:45:02,994
- Okay you want-

1113
00:45:02,994 --> 00:45:03,844
- Your gonna-

1114
00:45:03,844 --> 00:45:04,778
- Geez, you're very rigid.

1115
00:45:04,778 --> 00:45:06,366
- I'm rigid man.

1116
00:45:06,366 --> 00:45:09,608
- For somebody with orange
pants, he's very rigid.

1117
00:45:09,608 --> 00:45:10,985
- I asked him to come up for you.

1118
00:45:10,985 --> 00:45:12,128
He has one there, he's good.

1119
00:45:12,128 --> 00:45:13,543
And then we'll take that, if that's okay.

1120
00:45:13,543 --> 00:45:14,376
Thank you.

1121
00:45:16,306 --> 00:45:17,139
- [Gary] Good?

1122
00:45:17,139 --> 00:45:18,206
- [Man] You're on man, go for it.

1123
00:45:18,206 --> 00:45:20,759
Tell us who you are and
your question please.

1124
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:22,203
- [Aman] My name's Aman
and I'm from Burminham.

1125
00:45:22,203 --> 00:45:23,768
I'm from Premier Estates Wines.

1126
00:45:23,768 --> 00:45:24,620
- [Gary] How are you?

1127
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:25,555
- [Aman] I'm doing good, thanks.

1128
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:27,012
The question is, we want to know,

1129
00:45:27,012 --> 00:45:28,418
we've taken on board a few ideas

1130
00:45:28,418 --> 00:45:29,594
and they're working really well.

1131
00:45:29,594 --> 00:45:30,613
I want to know-

1132
00:45:30,613 --> 00:45:32,050
- [Gary] Wait, say that one more time.

1133
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:33,053
- We've taken-

1134
00:45:33,053 --> 00:45:34,052
I talk really fast, sorry.

1135
00:45:34,052 --> 00:45:36,632
We're taking on new ideas,
the DarkPost, et cetera

1136
00:45:36,632 --> 00:45:38,256
and it's working really well-

1137
00:45:38,256 --> 00:45:39,089
- [Gary] One more time.

1138
00:45:39,089 --> 00:45:41,019
(audience laughs)

1139
00:45:41,019 --> 00:45:44,084
I didn't hear it, I didn't hear it.

1140
00:45:44,084 --> 00:45:46,471
- We're taking on new ideas

1141
00:45:46,471 --> 00:45:48,157
and they're working really well,

1142
00:45:48,157 --> 00:45:49,283
DarkPost, et cetera.

1143
00:45:49,283 --> 00:45:50,573
- [Gary] Good.

1144
00:45:50,573 --> 00:45:51,448
- The next question is,

1145
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:55,493
how can we convert Snapchat
and Pinterest into sales?

1146
00:45:55,493 --> 00:45:57,700
- So Snapchat, especially right now,

1147
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,616
is much more like television
and outdoor media.

1148
00:46:00,616 --> 00:46:03,596
It's not DR, it's not
last touch attribution,

1149
00:46:03,596 --> 00:46:05,720
you're not gonna see the sale.

1150
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,985
Though, ironically, because I'm very close

1151
00:46:07,985 --> 00:46:10,474
to the Snapchat infrastructure,
I'm an investor,

1152
00:46:10,474 --> 00:46:13,076
we're an API partner,
there's a lot of DR coming.

1153
00:46:13,076 --> 00:46:15,515
We ran a campaign recently for AT&T

1154
00:46:15,515 --> 00:46:17,544
where you swipe up from the creative

1155
00:46:17,544 --> 00:46:19,593
and convert the form inside.

1156
00:46:19,593 --> 00:46:21,986
I think Snapchat two,
three, four years from now

1157
00:46:21,986 --> 00:46:25,425
will be a real DR play,
a conversion sales play.

1158
00:46:25,425 --> 00:46:26,260
But you have to understand,

1159
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,093
and this is actually-

1160
00:46:27,093 --> 00:46:28,172
Thank you so much for this question,

1161
00:46:28,172 --> 00:46:29,301
I'm glad I got to say this

1162
00:46:29,301 --> 00:46:31,187
because I've been wanting
to talk about it more.

1163
00:46:31,187 --> 00:46:33,968
My friends, there's a very big difference

1164
00:46:33,968 --> 00:46:37,116
between sales and marketing.

1165
00:46:37,116 --> 00:46:40,324
And we're blending them too much.

1166
00:46:40,324 --> 00:46:43,449
Right now, what I'm doing,
I'm doing marketing.

1167
00:46:43,449 --> 00:46:45,104
I'm creating awareness.

1168
00:46:45,104 --> 00:46:46,307
I'm giving you my ideas.

1169
00:46:46,307 --> 00:46:48,589
You may go down the rabbit
hole, may follow me,

1170
00:46:48,589 --> 00:46:50,115
you're getting into my funnel,

1171
00:46:50,115 --> 00:46:51,791
you've become aware of who I am.

1172
00:46:51,791 --> 00:46:53,013
That's marketing.

1173
00:46:53,013 --> 00:46:54,029
It's not-

1174
00:46:54,029 --> 00:46:55,682
I'm not gonna end this talk with like,

1175
00:46:55,682 --> 00:46:57,912
and now go to my website and buy my book.

1176
00:46:57,912 --> 00:46:58,765
That's not what you do.

1177
00:46:58,765 --> 00:47:01,171
So I think when you think about Snapchat,

1178
00:47:01,171 --> 00:47:02,613
think about it as marketing, right.

1179
00:47:02,613 --> 00:47:04,504
Listen, you know my speil.

1180
00:47:04,504 --> 00:47:06,041
I'm not looking for your money,

1181
00:47:06,041 --> 00:47:07,924
I haven't asked you for any money.

1182
00:47:07,924 --> 00:47:09,198
I'm building brand.

1183
00:47:09,198 --> 00:47:10,755
All my content is free.

1184
00:47:10,755 --> 00:47:12,139
You're not going down a funnel

1185
00:47:12,139 --> 00:47:14,254
that then charges you $100 a month.

1186
00:47:14,254 --> 00:47:16,052
So you need to do some of that.

1187
00:47:16,052 --> 00:47:19,773
Facebook is incredible for
marketing and sales, right.

1188
00:47:19,773 --> 00:47:20,913
Twitter's remarkable for that.

1189
00:47:20,913 --> 00:47:22,578
Pinterest is very easy for sales.

1190
00:47:22,578 --> 00:47:24,444
All those images link out.

1191
00:47:24,444 --> 00:47:26,028
Pinterest ads work quite well.

1192
00:47:26,028 --> 00:47:27,313
The problem for Pinterest,

1193
00:47:27,313 --> 00:47:29,294
and I'm an investor in that
company and I'm disappointed,

1194
00:47:29,294 --> 00:47:32,571
they have not moved to mobile
as well as they could have.

1195
00:47:32,571 --> 00:47:33,602
They won on desktop but they've

1196
00:47:33,602 --> 00:47:35,256
struggled with the mobile transition.

1197
00:47:35,256 --> 00:47:36,637
And I see the head nods so..

1198
00:47:36,637 --> 00:47:38,600
I think one thing you need,

1199
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,433
and you're a young dude.

1200
00:47:39,433 --> 00:47:40,266
One thing that you need
to really understand is,

1201
00:47:40,266 --> 00:47:43,673
there's platforms that
are great for sales,

1202
00:47:43,673 --> 00:47:45,491
there's platforms that's
great for marketing

1203
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:48,223
but to be really big, you have to do both.

1204
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:51,798
And some platforms, Facebook,
are incredible at both

1205
00:47:51,798 --> 00:47:53,465
which is why they're special.

1206
00:47:53,465 --> 00:47:54,795
- [Aman] Okay thanks a lot.

1207
00:47:54,795 --> 00:47:55,628
- [Gary] You got it brother.

1208
00:47:55,628 --> 00:47:57,359
- [Man] I identified this question

1209
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,496
because you said so much
about your hard work,

1210
00:47:59,496 --> 00:48:01,037
your discipline and what it takes

1211
00:48:01,037 --> 00:48:03,116
to really achieve what you've achieved.

1212
00:48:03,116 --> 00:48:05,320
Has a lot to do with
your regimen and with-

1213
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,826
- [Gary] Yeah, I mean, I didn't cover it-

1214
00:48:06,826 --> 00:48:08,180
real quick, I didn't cover it

1215
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,206
and so many of you raised
your hand, you know,

1216
00:48:10,206 --> 00:48:11,447
you didn't know who I was

1217
00:48:11,447 --> 00:48:12,896
and I should have probably

1218
00:48:12,896 --> 00:48:15,993
drank more of that in the beginning.

1219
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:17,653
You know, one thing I would say,

1220
00:48:17,653 --> 00:48:20,257
and this is an American
thing, I do believe that

1221
00:48:20,257 --> 00:48:23,097
but I just believe in hard work.

1222
00:48:23,097 --> 00:48:25,561
You know, no matter how talented you are.

1223
00:48:25,561 --> 00:48:26,394
I love when people say,

1224
00:48:26,394 --> 00:48:28,527
Gary, you always talk about a lot of work

1225
00:48:28,527 --> 00:48:29,792
but I work smart.

1226
00:48:29,792 --> 00:48:32,625
I go, Rich, I work smart and hard,

1227
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,369
now what asshole?

1228
00:48:35,369 --> 00:48:36,715
(laughter)

1229
00:48:36,715 --> 00:48:38,398
So, you're right.

1230
00:48:38,398 --> 00:48:40,489
I'm a very big believer that

1231
00:48:40,489 --> 00:48:42,197
if you're sitting in this room

1232
00:48:42,197 --> 00:48:44,384
and you're trying to achieve great things,

1233
00:48:44,384 --> 00:48:45,661
it's very hard to do that

1234
00:48:45,661 --> 00:48:47,863
in a five, seven, eight hour work day.

1235
00:48:47,863 --> 00:48:48,791
It just is.

1236
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:50,572
Somebody's gonna work nine, 10 and 11

1237
00:48:50,572 --> 00:48:52,033
and that's very competitive.

1238
00:48:52,033 --> 00:48:53,866
But family, interests,

1239
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:57,067
everybody should live their
lives they way they want to

1240
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,631
but if you want to build something big,

1241
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:00,413
if you want to create a big business,

1242
00:49:00,413 --> 00:49:05,086
hard work is the first second
and third part of the formula.

1243
00:49:05,086 --> 00:49:07,307
- [Man] Thank you so much for that.

1244
00:49:07,307 --> 00:49:08,840
You can't emphasize that enough.

1245
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,746
(audience applause)

1246
00:49:10,746 --> 00:49:12,329
How about up there?

1247
00:49:13,352 --> 00:49:15,233
We've had a lot of questions
from the front rows.

1248
00:49:15,233 --> 00:49:16,734
How about back there in section one,

1249
00:49:16,734 --> 00:49:20,620
anybody with an insightful
question for Gary

1250
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,546
before he leaves us?

1251
00:49:21,546 --> 00:49:24,506
He has exactly four
minutes, 33 seconds left.

1252
00:49:24,506 --> 00:49:25,808
- [Gary] While I've got the time

1253
00:49:25,808 --> 00:49:27,029
while somebody's deciding-

1254
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:28,341
raise your hand if you want to do this,

1255
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:30,218
but I'll say something to just bring value

1256
00:49:30,218 --> 00:49:31,340
during the down time.

1257
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,985
Another thing that I want to make sure,

1258
00:49:32,985 --> 00:49:34,811
and there's a lot of
executives in this room,

1259
00:49:34,811 --> 00:49:36,060
everything you've just heard,

1260
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,917
please make sure that you don't do-

1261
00:49:37,917 --> 00:49:38,871
you got a question?

1262
00:49:38,871 --> 00:49:39,993
Yeah, come up.

1263
00:49:39,993 --> 00:49:42,062
Make sure that you don't
do what everybody does

1264
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,344
which is, if you're a senior executive

1265
00:49:43,344 --> 00:49:44,698
or if you own your own business,

1266
00:49:44,698 --> 00:49:45,940
and you heard this talk and you say,

1267
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,433
oh wait, I think he's right,

1268
00:49:47,433 --> 00:49:50,198
don't go and just hire a 23 year old

1269
00:49:50,198 --> 00:49:52,629
and assume that they understand this.

1270
00:49:52,629 --> 00:49:55,356
That 23 year old was
using their mobile device

1271
00:49:55,356 --> 00:49:58,435
and social media to hook up with people.

1272
00:49:58,435 --> 00:50:00,735
No necessarily to sell stuff.

1273
00:50:00,735 --> 00:50:02,084
And more importantly-

1274
00:50:02,084 --> 00:50:03,311
and by the way, there
are some 23 year olds

1275
00:50:03,311 --> 00:50:04,343
that know how to sell stuff

1276
00:50:04,343 --> 00:50:05,901
but let's not do the cliche thing

1277
00:50:05,901 --> 00:50:08,072
and say, oh yes, my niece,

1278
00:50:08,072 --> 00:50:11,043
she's on Instagram, she's
gonna help my business.

1279
00:50:11,043 --> 00:50:11,899
That's not smart.

1280
00:50:11,899 --> 00:50:13,515
Everybody does that.

1281
00:50:13,515 --> 00:50:14,692
Please don't do that.

1282
00:50:14,692 --> 00:50:18,167
And number two, how many
people here own their business?

1283
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:19,627
Raise your hand.

1284
00:50:19,627 --> 00:50:20,592
A lot.

1285
00:50:20,592 --> 00:50:21,528
So listen-

1286
00:50:21,528 --> 00:50:22,611
- [Man] A lot of ownership.

1287
00:50:22,611 --> 00:50:25,523
- [Gary] One more time,
high, I just wanna-

1288
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:27,606
Okay, here's the most important part,

1289
00:50:27,606 --> 00:50:29,285
I'm really glad I got to say this,

1290
00:50:29,285 --> 00:50:31,417
everything I just talked about

1291
00:50:31,417 --> 00:50:32,850
so many of you are going to say,

1292
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:34,948
I don't understand this, I
didn't grow up with this,

1293
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,242
I don't know this.

1294
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:38,496
If you own your own business,

1295
00:50:38,496 --> 00:50:41,030
don't you think it makes sense

1296
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:44,280
for you to take 20 hours to either read

1297
00:50:45,654 --> 00:50:48,884
or watch videos on how
to place Facebook ads,

1298
00:50:48,884 --> 00:50:50,698
how to place Instagram ads,

1299
00:50:50,698 --> 00:50:52,145
how does LinkedIn work,

1300
00:50:52,145 --> 00:50:53,829
what is Medium.com.

1301
00:50:53,829 --> 00:50:56,052
When you have the audacity

1302
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:58,453
to be an entrepreneur
and own your own business

1303
00:50:58,453 --> 00:51:02,172
and want all the riches and
great things that come with it,

1304
00:51:02,172 --> 00:51:04,334
you need to put in the work.

1305
00:51:04,334 --> 00:51:07,227
I promise you, if you look
at your eight hours everyday,

1306
00:51:07,227 --> 00:51:10,025
two to three of them, you're
spending on dumb shit.

1307
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,551
(audience laughs)

1308
00:51:11,551 --> 00:51:13,312
you're spending it like it's 1994.

1309
00:51:13,312 --> 00:51:16,359
Take that back, go to YouTube and Google,

1310
00:51:16,359 --> 00:51:18,840
search how to place Facebook ads,

1311
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,324
how does Snapchat work,

1312
00:51:20,324 --> 00:51:22,965
does Instagram work for B2B SasS,

1313
00:51:22,965 --> 00:51:24,240
whatever it may be,

1314
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,490
spend 40, 50, 60 hours, do.

1315
00:51:28,064 --> 00:51:30,004
Because the biggest thing
I'm concerned about-

1316
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:33,547
One more time, show of
hands, business owners.

1317
00:51:33,547 --> 00:51:35,082
The biggest concern I have

1318
00:51:35,082 --> 00:51:36,312
is that you're gonna hire somebody

1319
00:51:36,312 --> 00:51:39,000
and you have no idea what they're doing.

1320
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,869
How are you going to judge if
that person's doing something-

1321
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:45,300
by the way, if you don't understand this,

1322
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,619
you're gonna lose either way.

1323
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:48,784
Either you're gonna hire somebody

1324
00:51:48,784 --> 00:51:50,246
who's not gonna do shit for you

1325
00:51:50,246 --> 00:51:53,341
but knows how to trick you
into thinking that they are

1326
00:51:53,341 --> 00:51:57,782
or they're gonna do well, it's
gonna matter to your business

1327
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:59,754
and then she or he will have the leverage

1328
00:51:59,754 --> 00:52:02,382
and either leave and do their own thing

1329
00:52:02,382 --> 00:52:05,240
or it will require a
lot more money from you.

1330
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,710
You have to be the best
person in your organization-

1331
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:08,293
- [Man] And do the work.

1332
00:52:08,293 --> 00:52:09,673
- [Gary] When I stand in
front of Vayner Media,

1333
00:52:09,673 --> 00:52:12,765
it's 800 people, very
young, sharp, best in class,

1334
00:52:12,765 --> 00:52:14,250
and when I stand in front of them and say,

1335
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:17,092
I'm the best in social
media, me, the old guy,

1336
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,781
the fucking uncle, right?

1337
00:52:18,781 --> 00:52:21,120
(laughter)

1338
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,825
I'm the best-

1339
00:52:22,825 --> 00:52:25,044
- [Man] And the eight guys
who were finished here

1340
00:52:25,044 --> 00:52:25,877
that you identified.

1341
00:52:25,877 --> 00:52:26,710
- [Gary] That's right.

1342
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:30,952
And so, to me you have
to be the best executor

1343
00:52:30,952 --> 00:52:32,043
in your organization.

1344
00:52:32,043 --> 00:52:36,194
This is communication and
communication drives everything.

1345
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,826
- [Man] We're gonna take
that one last question

1346
00:52:37,826 --> 00:52:39,322
from you please, thank you.

1347
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:42,831
- [Sean] Hi Gary, I'm Sean Russa.

1348
00:52:42,831 --> 00:52:44,714
Well, you answered my question already.

1349
00:52:44,714 --> 00:52:45,922
- [Gary] Well it was great to see you.

1350
00:52:45,922 --> 00:52:46,755
Have a good day.

1351
00:52:46,755 --> 00:52:49,524
- [Man] So one last question for you Gary.

1352
00:52:49,524 --> 00:52:52,488
- [Gary] Is that really it?

1353
00:52:52,488 --> 00:52:53,760
You can throw it back to him.

1354
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,381
- [Man] We only have a minute
before our next speaker.

1355
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:57,214
- [Gary] Go ahead.

1356
00:52:57,214 --> 00:53:00,189
- [Sean] So, well I was a
bit confused with Snapchat.

1357
00:53:00,189 --> 00:53:01,022
- [Gary] Okay.

1358
00:53:01,022 --> 00:53:02,215
- And I though myself I got old.

1359
00:53:02,215 --> 00:53:03,048
- [Gary] Yes.

1360
00:53:03,048 --> 00:53:04,357
- And I also confirmed with my friends

1361
00:53:04,357 --> 00:53:05,454
who graduated with me.

1362
00:53:05,454 --> 00:53:06,287
- [Gary] Yes.

1363
00:53:06,287 --> 00:53:07,120
- They all got old.

1364
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:07,953
- [Gary] Yeah, you're old.

1365
00:53:07,953 --> 00:53:08,786
- Yeah, so..

1366
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:09,862
(laughter)

1367
00:53:09,862 --> 00:53:11,424
but, you know, I'm still trying.

1368
00:53:11,424 --> 00:53:12,257
- [Gary] You should

1369
00:53:12,257 --> 00:53:13,555
- I'm still trying to
understand what Snapchat,

1370
00:53:13,555 --> 00:53:15,618
and how can it bring the value-

1371
00:53:15,618 --> 00:53:17,660
- [Gary] Because, you have to understand,

1372
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:20,498
and this is perfect, I've got 38 seconds,

1373
00:53:20,498 --> 00:53:23,671
nine years ago, Facebook was for college,

1374
00:53:23,671 --> 00:53:25,476
now it is not.

1375
00:53:25,476 --> 00:53:26,620
How does it bring value?

1376
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,707
If Snapchat holds on,
which I think it will,

1377
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:33,052
in five years my friend, you
won't be as old as you think.

1378
00:53:33,052 --> 00:53:34,443
You're gonna want to do business

1379
00:53:34,443 --> 00:53:37,117
and Snapchat is gonna
have 30 to 50 year old

1380
00:53:37,117 --> 00:53:39,774
Finn consumers in it's platform.

1381
00:53:39,774 --> 00:53:42,248
You need to figure out how
to make content in there

1382
00:53:42,248 --> 00:53:44,131
that makes them want to
do business with you.

1383
00:53:44,131 --> 00:53:45,602
- Well, trust me, I'm
spending half an hour

1384
00:53:45,602 --> 00:53:47,183
everyday from the last two months.

1385
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:48,016
- [Gary] I love it man.

1386
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:48,849
Good hustle.

1387
