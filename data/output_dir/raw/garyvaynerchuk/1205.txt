00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,750
and just took off and after five days we

55
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,700
decided to focus the whole team on that

56
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,870
what was the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> day that it was</font>

57

biggest misconception of meerkat right

71
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:01,209
now to three weeks in we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just getting</font>

72
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:03,489
going a lot of opinions yeah you know

73
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:06,280
Twitter's gonna shut you down periscope

00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,840
the biggest misconceptions you're

76
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,019
hearing right now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the biggest</font>

77
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,750
misconception is under estimating a team

78
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,010
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was with a product outside and had</font>

79
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,220
400,000 users and had the chance to eat

80
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,040
irate and make mistake over and over and

81
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,280
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again in this we had to let go for</font>

82
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,739
four person of our staff reduce it it

83
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:35,250
was we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of and</font>

84
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,989
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest misconception is under</font>

85
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:41,590
estimating how unpolished product could

86
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,739
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> and under estimating what a team that</font>

87
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:46,329
had a product out for two years and

88
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:48,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">closing products right different thing</font>

89
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,370
can do the context of all those

90
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,049
learnings the context of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

91
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:55,319
learning just

92
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,959
this is one misconception like this

93
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,730
forget about you know what let me take a

94
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,930
spin off because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a lot of the</font>

95
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,239
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that watch this are less worried</font>

96
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,650
about where you're going which i think

97
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,749
is right the business world yeah what

98
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:08,549
about them on a day-to-day basis normal

99
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,409
people yeah let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> go that route</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

100
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:12,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so this is the biggest</font>

101
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:14,609
misconception and people ask why now why

102
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:18,089
now live stream so we were kids we had

103
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:21,539
cameras our<font color="#E5E5E5"> parents had cameras we know</font>

104
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:24,120
what standard of a good photo we know

105
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,130
how good photo should look like what is

106
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,470
the mindset diet would follow what are

107
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,750
the standards of what it means a good

108
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,570
photo so when software substitute came

109
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,030
like Instagram it was an easy transition

110
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,460
for the habit<font color="#E5E5E5"> forming to go to the</font>

111
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,289
software side we know what a good photo

112
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:41,849
should look like we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it means</font>

113
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,120
live streaming is not we didn't live

114
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,039
stream when we were kids<font color="#CCCCCC"> our parents</font>

115
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:50,160
didn't live stream and the biggest

116
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,670
misconception

117
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,540

127
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,419
the early 20th century people didn't

128
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:25,550
smile on picture it was weird to smile

129
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,650
and pick or in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russia in the 60s and 70s</font>

130
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,389
because they were miserable keep going

131
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:32,690
and that means how habit needs time to

132
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,539
evolve and we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> now unlocking this</font>

133
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:38,750
habit of live streaming live streaming

134
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,430
how people are going to be live

135
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,560
streamers what does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean what is a</font>

136
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,379
good stream what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it mean to be what</font>

137
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,180
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it mean to discover live stream in</font>

138
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,280
real time and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot of</font>

139
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,650
this for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn and there's a lot</font>

140
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,840
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we already learned and I</font>

141
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,289
think that the biggest misconception is

142
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,110
thinking that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is not</font>

143
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,979
going to be a new medium here because

144
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:05,870
because we are unlocking you sets of

145
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,430
having what percentage of normal people

146
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,349
do you think don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think live streaming</font>

147
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:12,199
is gonna take off I don't I what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

148
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,190
guess what's your guess I don't know I I

149
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,389
assume a lot of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're not</font>

150
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:19,909
they don't know what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> means to go long</font>

151
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:21,650
they don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they know</font>

152
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,029
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think I just do you think do</font>

00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:25,009
they think and live streaming<font color="#CCCCCC"> bandido do</font>

154
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,860
you think 12 13 14 15 16 year olds are

155
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,289
more likely to say this is gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>
