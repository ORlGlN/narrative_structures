books coming out I'm putting a lot out

56
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,840
there but I always talk about how I

57
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,299
don't read and that's true I mean listen

58
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:55,799
Alex and you know this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's awesome</font>

59
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,909
you'll see what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here in a</font>

60
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,340
minute but you know call spade a spade I

61
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,960
can't go up there and say I read<font color="#CCCCCC"> Seth</font>

62
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">Godin in the world is flat guy cuz I</font>

63
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,990
don't mean any of that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

64
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,619
only anything so at the sink joking I'm

65
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,568
putting out content I read Jets insider

66
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,580
I read<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the Jets a whole lot i read</font>

67
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,090
old

68
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,209
boxing results so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I consume different</font>

69
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:17,610
kind of media than I put out and I think

70
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,690
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people get confused about</font>

71
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,209
having to read what you put out that is

72
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,280
not a necessity certain people born with

73
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,110
DNA to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to rock out certain</font>

74
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,910
categories and I feel with marketing

75
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,620
it's just what I know right and so I'm

76
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,450
not compelled to read it because I feel

77
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it's in here now listen that</font>

78
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,870
doesn't also<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume that I know</font>

79
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,030
everything trust me I've learned a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

80
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,500
by reading the blogosphere sufficient

81
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,910
early on and as a matter of fact I want

82
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">to read more because I feel out of loop</font>

83
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,420
sometimes so but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't and I want</font>

84
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,680
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call a spade a spade and I hope that</font>

85
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">Alex you and I'm some people take this</font>

86
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,880
wrong and I respect that I understand

87
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,610
but it's not hypocritical it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

88
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,739
if you like consuming content about the

89
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,230
new world and with details and the most

90
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,450
awesome book ever then maybe you want to

91
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,950
pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up but you know you know I'm</font>

92
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">making a joke the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fact of matter is</font>

93
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:01,980
that's where that comes from but what I

94
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,489
did after that was when Alex said that I

95
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:07,489
decided to then search his name um

96
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:10,079
unsearched out<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter to see who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

97
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:11,910
responding to him because some people

98
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,140
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have not referenced garyvee</font>

99
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,400
because a lot of times you'll find it

100
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,010
funny actually um if people are mad at

101
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,510
you or don't like you they'll not

102
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,190
reference you so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did was I</font>

103
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,400
searched his name and I found um<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

104
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,630
after he put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that at g excuse me Gabe k</font>

105
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,900
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh oh you just opened a really</font>

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,980

went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gabe congress uh blog he wrote a</font>

116
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,620
reason i can't click with him um he

117
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,150
positions himself differently on mine

118
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,680
that he doesn't person which<font color="#E5E5E5"> i totally</font>

119
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,989
disagree with gabe but fair enough if

120
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:02,269
you feel it you're right I'm wrong

121
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:04,290
customers always right guys I mean

122
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,209
anybody consumer your stuff there right

123
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:07,680
you need to figure out what you're not

124
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">connecting with during his talks Friday</font>

125
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,010
he said he doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the answers and</font>

126
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,840
he told<font color="#E5E5E5"> a story that worked for him and</font>

127
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">all he can do hope you find what works</font>

128
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,130
for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> but online</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he positions himself</font>

129
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,410
as a role model with all the answers

130
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,899
when in reality he's a wine salesman

131
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,660
like to think of myself is a little bit

132
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,800
online sales them up but you know

133
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,250
respect that key and and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way it's</font>

134
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,050
true<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean do I feel that I can go into</font>

135
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,150
any single person's business that's

136
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,590
watching this right now and help it grow

137
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,100
I do not I do I flat up do I can crush

138
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,470
it but I understand I also don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

139
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,450
come across as a douche bag which I can

140
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,280
at times and I don't say oh my god<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

141
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,510
do anything for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I've got all the</font>

142
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,950
answers cuz nobody has all<font color="#E5E5E5"> answers I</font>

143
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,150
don't feel like a position myself that

144
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,770
way but I respect that cuz that's how he

145
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,480
feels I think Gary would be the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

146
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,860
agree that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not cool and you're</font>

147
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,840
right I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would um actually I might have</font>

148
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,430
jumped at all all he is a wine sales

149
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,290
when he gives an idea online many people

150
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,640
jump at it believing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

151
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,800
spontaneous ideas are somehow better

152
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,960
than their own and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gary would be</font>

153
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,210
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first to say that's not cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I do</font>

154
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,010
feel that I have some marketing ideas

155
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,030
that might be better than other people

156
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,800
so I consoled for a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font>

157
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,750
are very very smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

158
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,800
they're good ideas but I verse nobody's

159
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,690
coming from I like his tone on it after

160
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing him in person he wants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people to</font>

161
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,810
succeed based on what they want not

162
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,640
because they copied verbatim what he has

163
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,710
to say I believe he means well but it's

164
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,390
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> online personality and</font>

165
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,810
also say I have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same time</font>

166
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,860
Gabe that's where i'm probably not doing

167
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">a good enough job i'm not saying i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

168
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,420
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea i'm saying i don't have the time</font>

169
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,400
to look at every single person's idea

170
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,620
and if i did<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guarantee i could help</font>

171
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">people get their businesses get their</font>

172
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,640
brands get there but I wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

173
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,020
coming from isla bring this up because

174
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,820
during the awesome speaker panel he told

175
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,440
the crowd to quit college and it's an

176
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,940
outdated institution that's going down

177
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,190
Jason fleet said the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> big bubble to</font>

178
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,870
burst was education I sent out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tweet</font>

179
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,220
saying it's probably the first thing

180
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,900
I've ever agreed with coming from Gary

181
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,000
Gary replied<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter with a smile I</font>

182
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,800
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at my Twitter during our</font>

183
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,510
panel up there and I did see that he

184
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,250
then mentioned my comment during his

185
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,320
talk which I did he's bummed when people

186
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,880
have problems with him I found him at

187
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> party that night he looked like he</font>

188
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,669
had his hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> playful a lot of people</font>

189
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:09,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming around I guess so I left it at</font>

190
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,360
that so all in all I learned Gary

191
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,000
Vaynerchuk is human which very true but

192
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,320
I still think he's a salesman who

193
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,510
doesn't have all the answers I mean I'm

194
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,680
a Salesman amongst other things but I

195
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,910
definitely don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it all the answers</font>

196
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I think he's right in a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font>

197
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,270
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same token i hope i defined what</font>

198
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,190
I think they're I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there's</font>

199
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,020
some guards to what I say I don't repeat

200
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,210
stuff all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that much but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> totally get</font>

201
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,190
where he's coming from I read<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

202
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,380

themselves and I do believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's passion</font>

239
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,870
and I do believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the details which is</font>

00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,670
why I wrote the book in the details of

how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build that brand get in the</font>

242
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,730
trenches by the way why this video I

on how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> handle constructive</font>

252
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,810
conversation he goes I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

253
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">great idea the world needs more of this</font>

254
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,590
absolutely see here's the problem when

255
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,510
somebody says what Gabe said about me a

256
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,310
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people get emotional in the world</font>

257
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,510
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> business if you put yourself out</font>

258
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,120
there you can't get emotional you're in

259
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,679
an unemotional game and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

260
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,849
yourself as an emotional<font color="#E5E5E5"> character</font>

261
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,169
you're gonna have some interesting times

262
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,640
navigating through the world we live in

263
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,650
you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself out there you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

264
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,630
expect people to have opinions and a lot

265
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">of times they're right and sometimes</font>

266
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,450
they're wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sometimes it's in</font>

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,550
between I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this almost proud</font>

00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:50,959
that Gabe and I through technology are

270
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,910
probably in a place now where we like

271
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,560
each other so much more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this didn't</font>

272
