1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,097
- You know, I'm concerned a little bit

2
00:00:02,097 --> 00:00:04,751
with the culture of
celebrating the fund raise.

3
00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:08,048
You know, my dad taught me
that when you borrow money

4
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:10,020
it's the worst day of your life.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,628
So I'm very interested
in the entrepreneurs.

6
00:00:12,628 --> 00:00:16,154
I like you know, we
didn't clap for Red Rover

7
00:00:16,154 --> 00:00:18,167
because they didn't raise
six trillion dollars.

8
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:20,591
But I was sitting here like good stuff.

9
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:22,589
I just filtered myself, so.

10
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,083
(laughter)

11
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,246
You know, what I'm looking
for is people that are not

12
00:00:27,246 --> 00:00:28,755
caught up in the excitement.

13
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:30,634
Even though I'm a hype man myself,

14
00:00:30,634 --> 00:00:32,511
I like the practicality of it all,

15
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:34,587
people that understand
how to turn a profit.

16
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:36,789
I mean, at the end of the day
this is still business, right?

17
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:38,710
So I'm looking for real
practical knowledge

18
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,747
of how to actually make money,

19
00:00:40,747 --> 00:00:42,497
not necessarily raise it.

20
00:00:42,497 --> 00:00:00,000
