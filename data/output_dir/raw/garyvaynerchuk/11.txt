1
00:00:01,353 --> 00:00:03,042
- Alright so real quick,

2
00:00:03,042 --> 00:00:04,189
I have to catch a plane.

3
00:00:04,189 --> 00:00:06,902
And I have like 10 minutes which means

4
00:00:06,902 --> 00:00:08,229
all of you in line are fucked.

5
00:00:08,229 --> 00:00:09,541
(audience laughs)

6
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:12,208
(hip hop music)

7
00:00:16,406 --> 00:00:19,598
So the current state of entrepreneurship

8
00:00:19,598 --> 00:00:21,749
is in an interesting spot.

9
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:24,486
I think it's an amazing time

10
00:00:24,486 --> 00:00:28,573
at the same token, an
awkward time for me because

11
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:29,878
I'm really fearful.

12
00:00:29,878 --> 00:00:32,277
Like, I'm not about entrepreneurship.

13
00:00:32,277 --> 00:00:35,021
I'm about all of you
deploying self-awareness

14
00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:36,909
and figuring yourself out,

15
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:38,543
because that is always
going to be the path

16
00:00:38,543 --> 00:00:40,984
that gets you to a happy place quickest.

17
00:00:40,984 --> 00:00:44,513
This pedestal that
entrepreneurship is on right now

18
00:00:44,513 --> 00:00:46,910
is weirdly dangerous,

19
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,782
because it's making a lot
of people start businesses

20
00:00:49,782 --> 00:00:51,826
that ultimately won't be successful

21
00:00:51,826 --> 00:00:54,062
and actually can put them
in a pretty tough spot.

22
00:00:54,062 --> 00:00:56,069
So, my ambition here is not for all of you

23
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:58,049
to go home and start your own business.

24
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:00,129
My ambition is for all
of you to understand

25
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:01,882
why I'm so happy

26
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:03,834
and it's because I figured myself out

27
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:06,645
at a young age on the back of DNA,

28
00:01:06,645 --> 00:01:08,509
ridiculously good parenting and

29
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:11,047
circumstance of my environment.

30
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:12,575
And that's what this is all about.

31
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:14,951
What entrepreneurship's about

32
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:17,157
is putting yourself in
a position to succeed.

33
00:01:17,157 --> 00:01:19,421
I think my strengths,

34
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:22,349
which have created this narrative,

35
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,453
are I have really good natural

36
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:29,286
intuition and understanding
of human behavior.

37
00:01:30,477 --> 00:01:34,237
So, I think that I've
understood consumer behavior

38
00:01:34,237 --> 00:01:36,077
and where it's going and the internet.

39
00:01:36,077 --> 00:01:38,527
I think I'm running a marathon

40
00:01:38,527 --> 00:01:40,677
so I'm extremely patient,

41
00:01:40,677 --> 00:01:43,717
which I think is a huge factor.

42
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:45,967
I think that my work ethic,

43
00:01:47,913 --> 00:01:50,330
my actions match my ambition.

44
00:01:51,818 --> 00:01:55,978
And I would say probably
my lack of fear of failing.

45
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:58,653
I think it's more
important to learn and fail

46
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:00,763
than to always be right,

47
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:02,051
mainly on the back of not worrying

48
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:04,076
about what other people think.

49
00:02:04,076 --> 00:02:05,553
I think those are some
of the core ingredients

50
00:02:05,553 --> 00:02:07,289
that have really helped me.

51
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:08,251
Right?

52
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:10,377
And I think the ultimate
way to put yourself

53
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:12,122
in a position to succeed

54
00:02:12,122 --> 00:02:14,257
is to deploy self-awareness, so

55
00:02:14,257 --> 00:02:16,036
as fun as this is gonna
sound and as hyped up

56
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,401
as we all are,

57
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:20,091
this is a ridiculous vibe
and a beautiful setting

58
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:22,330
and the energy is off the charts,

59
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,179
I really really want to set the tone and

60
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:26,762
bring it down a notch to practicality

61
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:28,290
because I want you to win.

62
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,321
And winning comes at a
million different forms,

63
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:32,394
but it starts with being happy.

64
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:37,144
And you will always lose when
you try to force something.

65
00:02:43,674 --> 00:02:46,037
And so again, back to being self-aware,

66
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:47,997
you need to know yourself.

67
00:02:47,997 --> 00:02:50,278
Do you love getting punched in the face?

68
00:02:50,278 --> 00:02:52,405
Do you have the stomach for it?

69
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,477
And the truth is,

70
00:02:53,477 --> 00:02:56,421
it's not cool, it feels cool right now,

71
00:02:56,421 --> 00:03:00,504
but it's not cool, it's
just a personality trait.

72
00:03:06,762 --> 00:03:07,688
What up, Vlog?

73
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,600
Just landed in Tampa, a
little in and out trip for

74
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,264
Iris and I.

75
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:12,347
It is 2:40pm.

76
00:03:13,553 --> 00:03:16,185
We'll be back here at the
airport at like 7 or 8.

77
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:18,585
So, a quick little flight, but

78
00:03:18,585 --> 00:03:19,728
something that's emerged in the

79
00:03:19,728 --> 00:03:20,930
last three or four days for me

80
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,728
that I'm gonna start building on top of

81
00:03:22,728 --> 00:03:26,376
and I want to interrupt
these regularly scheduled

82
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:29,168
programs of the vlog and
rant to you a little bit.

83
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,272
It's about kindness.

84
00:03:31,272 --> 00:03:32,816
It has become very apparent to me

85
00:03:32,816 --> 00:03:34,272
as I continue to dissect

86
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,304
why the fuck is this shit working for me

87
00:03:36,304 --> 00:03:38,192
and how do I get it to work for you?

88
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:40,152
Kindness is foundational for me.

89
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:43,448
It is absolutely a core tenant,

90
00:03:43,448 --> 00:03:46,769
and it delivers unbelievable
dividends in business

91
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,884
but more importantly, in life.

92
00:03:48,884 --> 00:03:51,680
I don't know why winning in business

93
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,036
or being an alpha

94
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:54,516
or trying to make something happen

95
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:57,421
I'll be right with you, just
giving my rant on kindness!

96
00:03:57,421 --> 00:03:59,277
Is not associated with kindness enough

97
00:03:59,277 --> 00:04:00,316
and I just

98
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:01,753
am desperate for everybody watching this

99
00:04:01,753 --> 00:04:02,892
to start understanding

100
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:05,284
how much kindness is
part of this equation?

101
00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:07,287
It just works, it feels good,

102
00:04:07,287 --> 00:04:09,111
it may not come natural to you,

103
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:11,719
but you need to dissect
it and understand it,

104
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,265
and more importantly if you have it,

105
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:15,324
especially if you're a tough dude,

106
00:04:15,324 --> 00:04:17,459
you need to triple fuckin' down on it.

107
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,292
'Cause it works,

108
00:04:18,293 --> 00:04:19,132
period.

109
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:20,724
End of story.

110
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:22,309
Let's go.

111
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:23,142
This is Iris.

112
00:04:23,142 --> 00:04:23,975
- Hello.

113
00:04:23,975 --> 00:04:24,808
- Nice to meet you, Iris, I'm Susan.

114
00:04:24,808 --> 00:04:25,641
- [Gary] Let's go!

115
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:26,973
- [Iris] Nice to meet you.
- [Susan] Nice to meet you.

116
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:30,390
(light reflective music)

117
00:04:47,598 --> 00:04:48,461
- [Man] Can you tell me about your

118
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:51,165
strategy, you posted a video a while ago

119
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,957
and right now we're
going through the whole

120
00:04:52,957 --> 00:04:54,845
recruitment phase for companies

121
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:55,805
and stuff like that.

122
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:57,557
But I already know for a long time now

123
00:04:57,557 --> 00:04:59,830
that I just want to do my own thing.

124
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,037
At that same time, you have this pressure

125
00:05:01,037 --> 00:05:03,357
and this stigma that you
have to go out and get a job.

126
00:05:03,357 --> 00:05:04,485
- [Gary] From who?

127
00:05:04,485 --> 00:05:06,695
- From your parents and from society.

128
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:09,200
- Society doesn't have a
face, so that should be

129
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,279
easy to navigate.

130
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,493
- It's also the time management.

131
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:15,029
Should I invest a lot of
time in my side hustles,

132
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:16,556
but I'm also doing stuff for school

133
00:05:16,556 --> 00:05:17,389
- Let me give you something that

134
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,306
really fuckin' matters.

135
00:05:21,637 --> 00:05:23,813
It actually doesn't matter what you do

136
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:25,365
in all of your 20's.

137
00:05:25,365 --> 00:05:28,646
You have too much time to
correct it in your 30's.

138
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:31,053
If you actually understood that

139
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:32,757
it doesn't fuckin' matter,

140
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:34,511
there is no right or wrong answer,

141
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:36,437
everything gets real fuckin' easy.

142
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:37,270
- [Man] I appreciate that.

143
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,197
- I mean that!

144
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:39,381
I'm not saying it to be like,

145
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,301
waahh!

146
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:41,245
I'm saying it because

147
00:05:41,245 --> 00:05:43,412
you have fuckin' unlimited

148
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:46,251
you have unlimited time!

149
00:05:46,251 --> 00:05:47,460
- Sometimes it doesn't
feel that way, though.

150
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,293
- No, bro,

151
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:49,995
it doesn't feel that way
because you're letting

152
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:52,328
other voices into your head.

153
00:05:53,214 --> 00:05:55,147
You value other people's
opinions more than

154
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,755
you value your own.

155
00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:58,859
And that's 99 percent of people,

156
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,347
that's not like, you suck,

157
00:06:00,347 --> 00:06:02,683
that's what you have to
start thinking about.

158
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:06,227
Because when you're 87,
you're gonna be pissed.

159
00:06:06,227 --> 00:06:08,301
'Cause then you don't have time.

160
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,779
Now you have the best asset.

161
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,307
With everything I've got,

162
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:13,659
I would trade with you
three fuckers right now.

163
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:14,979
I'm being dead fuckin' serious.

164
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:16,446
For everything I've got,

165
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:18,539
I'll take the 22 years back.

166
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,039
Time's the fuckin' asset, bro.

167
00:06:23,702 --> 00:06:24,535
You believe it?

168
00:06:24,535 --> 00:06:26,241
- I believe it, and this
is another question I have

169
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:27,617
because it's relevant to time.

170
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:28,697
How do you optimize
your time when it comes

171
00:06:28,697 --> 00:06:30,251
to task of what you're doing it for?

172
00:06:30,251 --> 00:06:31,225
- Well first of all,

173
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,753
when you have time as your asset,

174
00:06:32,753 --> 00:06:35,065
you shouldn't over-stress optimizing it

175
00:06:35,065 --> 00:06:37,497
which is why I'm like,
fuck up in your 20's,

176
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,545
because that's your biggest asset.

177
00:06:39,545 --> 00:06:42,963
The leverage for you have its time.

178
00:06:42,963 --> 00:06:44,882
To me, it's kind of like,

179
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:47,873
I talk a lot about macro and micro.

180
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:49,803
That's like doing things
in parallel, right?

181
00:06:49,803 --> 00:06:51,489
So every day, I go hard.

182
00:06:51,489 --> 00:06:54,161
But at the highest level I'm patient.

183
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:56,217
So I'm much more worried about you

184
00:06:56,217 --> 00:06:59,634
dicking around from 7am to midnight today

185
00:07:01,873 --> 00:07:04,002
but not doing behavior
that worries about it

186
00:07:04,002 --> 00:07:05,334
at the macro.

187
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:07,143
So I'm more worried about
you watching an hour

188
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:08,601
of dumb TV.

189
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:11,759
First of all, everything
has to map your ambitions.

190
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,438
So first of all what
the fuck are you up to?

191
00:07:14,438 --> 00:07:16,622
Because if you want to be wealthy

192
00:07:16,622 --> 00:07:18,415
and live a good quality life,

193
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:20,734
it actually doesn't take that much work or

194
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:23,806
making $200,000 a year is an unbelievably

195
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:25,062
high quality of life.

196
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:26,648
The problem is, everybody now is

197
00:07:26,648 --> 00:07:28,335
thinking in like, millions and hundreds

198
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:30,805
everybody thinks they're
gonna build these huge things.

199
00:07:30,805 --> 00:07:31,950
- Create value.

200
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,526
- If you want to create value,

201
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:35,693
you can be done right now.

202
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,246
Just fuckin' ask every
person what they need.

203
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:40,549
- Meaningful value not just to me,

204
00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:41,716
but to masses.

205
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,334
- Well then, if you want masses,

206
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:47,471
if you want to really impact,

207
00:07:47,471 --> 00:07:49,414
what I'm up to has been fuckin'

208
00:07:49,414 --> 00:07:51,830
15 hours a day for 22 years in a row

209
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,580
giving up all sorts of
shit, leisure and fun.

210
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,447
It's just about understanding,
it's self-awareness

211
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:01,878
but the biggest thing

212
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:05,470
is putting over pressure in the short term

213
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,877
is a bad fuckin' move.

214
00:08:07,877 --> 00:08:08,895
It's a bad move.

215
00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:11,562
It leads to short term behavior.

216
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:14,541
You end up doing short term decisions.

217
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,598
There's people that left VaynerMedia

218
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:17,710
for $3,000 dollar more in salary

219
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,582
because they wanted to
move out of their place.

220
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:21,832
They fucked up.

221
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:26,133
- I've been following you for a long time.

222
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,014
- So

223
00:08:27,014 --> 00:08:27,847
- At least three years

224
00:08:27,847 --> 00:08:29,614
- If that's the case, take the one

225
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:34,053
I have the most heart for
which is being patient.

226
00:08:34,053 --> 00:08:35,581
Be smart.

227
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,880
Of course your parents
have points of view.

228
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,645
Of course you want to see how
you size up to your homies.

229
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,478
But,

230
00:08:43,235 --> 00:08:44,421
I look

231
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:46,008
compared to my homies in my 20's

232
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:46,841
I was a loser.

233
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:50,087
I worked in my dad's liquor store.

234
00:08:50,087 --> 00:08:51,647
That's my truth.

235
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:53,246
- [Female] I think
that's the biggest thing

236
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:54,213
at UF,

237
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:55,421
we see so many people

238
00:08:55,421 --> 00:08:56,710
especially within in the business school

239
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,200
that are already killin' it,

240
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,584
and we're just like

241
00:09:00,584 --> 00:09:01,834
- "Killing it".

242
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:03,762
"Killing it".

243
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:05,192
Like, what's "killing it"?

244
00:09:05,192 --> 00:09:06,178
- They don't know shit about business.

245
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,011
- Yeah.

246
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:11,539
They're just going after
the big, best internships.

247
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:12,453
- If he was like,

248
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:13,829
if he was like, yo!

249
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:15,277
I got an internship at Facebook,

250
00:09:15,277 --> 00:09:16,278
I'd be like, cool.

251
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:17,733
I don't know, like, what?

252
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:18,749
- [Female] Yeah.

253
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:19,773
- [Male] If I got a sales internship,

254
00:09:19,773 --> 00:09:20,813
though, that would be different.

255
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:22,517
- It might make your mom proud.

256
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:23,925
Maybe, for that kid.

257
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:24,951
- [Female] It's not making you happy.

258
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:26,749
- By the way, maybe it does!

259
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:28,236
But that's it.

260
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:30,086
It's gotta be binary.

261
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:31,423
- [Host] Tampa, what is up?

262
00:09:31,423 --> 00:09:33,598
(crowd cheers)

263
00:09:33,598 --> 00:09:35,909
- [Gary] If I could use
the attention right now

264
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,083
to say one thing.

265
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,093
Please deploy self-awareness.

266
00:09:39,093 --> 00:09:41,461
You don't have to be an entrepreneur.

267
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:43,430
You don't have to be anything, actually.

268
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,189
What you need to try to
do with all your might

269
00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:47,309
is go inside your head and understand

270
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:48,429
who you are,

271
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:50,365
and not apologize for it,

272
00:09:50,365 --> 00:09:52,635
and that really matters to me.

273
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,160
I just want to thank you guys so much

274
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,560
for all the good vibes.

275
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,653
I hope you come over and check out

276
00:09:57,653 --> 00:09:59,061
the talk I'm about to give.

277
00:09:59,061 --> 00:10:01,677
But I actually weirdly
rather you go back home

278
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:03,687
and fuckin' hustle on your own shit.

279
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:07,104
(crowd cheers, applauds)

280
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,933
Vlog!

281
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:11,661
We gotta go back episodes.

282
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:14,413
The fuckin' O.G. CFO of VaynerMedia

283
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,549
Scotty the fuckin' CFO the best.

284
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,710
So good to see you.

285
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,169
Lives down here now.

286
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:21,037
(laughs)

287
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:21,934
So good to see you, man.

288
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:23,434
- Good to see you.

289
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:25,517
- [Gary] Thank you so much.

290
00:10:25,517 --> 00:10:26,844
No it's really real.

291
00:10:26,844 --> 00:10:27,987
- [May] I'm a little sick so I'm gonna

292
00:10:27,987 --> 00:10:28,837
give you hand sanitizer.

293
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:29,670
- Okay, no worries.

294
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,503
Hi.

295
00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:31,336
- This is

296
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:32,169
she's part of the Chinese team.

297
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:33,002
- How are you?

298
00:10:33,002 --> 00:10:33,835
(laughs)
- Good.

299
00:10:33,835 --> 00:10:34,668
- Such a pleasure.

300
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:35,501
Thank you so much.

301
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:36,334
For real, for real.

302
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:37,167
- Thanks for coming down.

303
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:38,000
- But it's been really,

304
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,022
you're really helping.

305
00:10:39,022 --> 00:10:39,855
- Thanks, boss.

306
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:40,688
- You're making an impact.

307
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:41,521
- Thank you.

308
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:42,354
And I'm just gonna go and

309
00:10:42,354 --> 00:10:44,270
push this in, and can you
sign three books for me

310
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,116
for the Chinese team?

311
00:10:45,116 --> 00:10:45,949
- 100 percent.
- And I'm gonna

312
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:46,782
send it to China.

313
00:10:46,782 --> 00:10:47,615
- You got it.

314
00:10:47,615 --> 00:10:48,448
- Alright, so

315
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,848
you're gonna be meeting
with YChina on March 19th?

316
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:50,712
- Yes.

317
00:10:50,712 --> 00:10:53,992
- And they are a digital company that goes

318
00:10:53,992 --> 00:10:55,673
that spreads messages about
what foreigners feel like

319
00:10:55,673 --> 00:10:56,506
living in China.

320
00:10:56,506 --> 00:10:57,339
- Yes.

321
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:59,864
- So Raz's team and his content producers

322
00:10:59,864 --> 00:11:00,719
and audience has

323
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,216
a few questions for you.

324
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:03,049
The first question is,

325
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:04,727
why do you want to
enter the Chinese market

326
00:11:04,727 --> 00:11:06,112
when you already have
such a huge following

327
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:08,201
on the Western market?

328
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:09,936
- Because my ambition is great.

329
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:12,849
The truth is, I have very big ambitions.

330
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:15,697
And in my lifetime it will be the

331
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:17,736
number one global market in the world.

332
00:11:17,736 --> 00:11:20,120
It is the number one
global market in the world.

333
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,311
That's hard for Americans
who have had that throne

334
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:24,042
for a long time but

335
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:26,265
there are so many people
that I want to reach.

336
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:30,567
And the thought of not
being in mainland China

337
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:31,855
is just unacceptable.

338
00:11:31,855 --> 00:11:32,688
- Okay.

339
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:33,521
Thank you.

340
00:11:48,171 --> 00:11:49,509

to say something to vlog?

341
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,342
- Yep.

342
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,364
About to give a speech

343
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:53,438
and that's all I have to say.

344
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:54,771

00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:38,902
It's real.

366
00:12:38,902 --> 00:12:41,504
And the reason I go there,

367
00:12:41,504 --> 00:12:44,014
I need you guys all to
listen very carefully.

368
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,830
Everybody, including me,

369
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,790
is underestimating how big
this internet thing is.

370
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:52,302
We got so lucky and we're
also a little bit screwed.

371
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:54,110
A lot of you in 30, 40, 50 years

372
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,398
are gonna look back at this
year and be like, fuck.

373
00:12:56,398 --> 00:12:57,976
How good we had it.

374
00:12:57,976 --> 00:12:59,486
I didn't get it.

375
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:00,845
And I'll tell you what I mean by that.

376
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:02,492
The reason I was able to
build my dad's business

377
00:13:02,492 --> 00:13:03,972
from a three to a 60
million dollar business

378
00:13:03,972 --> 00:13:07,284
like that was because of the internet.

379
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:08,812
I would have done it.

380
00:13:08,812 --> 00:13:10,612
I would have had 15 liquor stores,

381
00:13:10,612 --> 00:13:12,180
I would have done it.

382
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,733
But it wouldn't have been done that way,

383
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:16,156
and definitely not at that speed.

384
00:13:16,156 --> 00:13:17,489
This thing is so

385
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,190
guys, this is a more powerful computer

386
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,772
in your pocket right now

387
00:13:21,772 --> 00:13:25,004
than President Reagan had
running the fuckin' free world.

388
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,023
Everything's about distribution

389
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:28,508
and what you put in it.

390
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:31,214
Do you know how crazy it would be

391
00:13:31,214 --> 00:13:34,748
to wake up tomorrow and
not have the internet?

392
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:36,556
You'd just sit.

393
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:38,974
(audience laughs)

394
00:13:38,974 --> 00:13:41,391
You wouldn't know what to do.

395
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,174
This is now where we live.

396
00:13:44,174 --> 00:13:45,064
This

397
00:13:45,064 --> 00:13:46,574
is not secondary

398
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:47,580
to this.

399
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,716
You may not like it,

400
00:13:48,716 --> 00:13:50,053
you may think it's weird,

401
00:13:50,053 --> 00:13:51,028
but it's the truth.

402
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:51,908
And it will play out,

403
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:52,741
and guess what?

404
00:13:52,741 --> 00:13:55,348
A lot of things have
happened to the human race.

405
00:13:55,348 --> 00:13:59,449
We struggle in putting
things into context.

406
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:03,204
Because you take for
granted what you have.

407
00:14:03,204 --> 00:14:05,204
- [Audience Member] I really like the idea

408
00:14:05,204 --> 00:14:07,023
that documenting the process

409
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:07,856
- [Gary] Huge.

410
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:08,689
- Yeah

411
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:10,020
- Bro, could you imagine,

412
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,181
how many people here vlogging?

413
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:13,014
(audience cheers)

414
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:13,953
- [Audience Member] Every damn day, baby!

415
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:14,804
- [Gary] Let's go!

416
00:14:14,804 --> 00:14:15,637
Yeah baby!

417
00:14:18,548 --> 00:14:20,772
Could you imagine if we were lucky enough

418
00:14:20,772 --> 00:14:22,481
that vlogging has been around for 50 years

419
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:23,739
and we could have seen all the people

420
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:25,212
that we think are incredible,

421
00:14:25,212 --> 00:14:27,998
just see their process
of coming up the game?

422
00:14:27,998 --> 00:14:30,839
More importantly, back to every damn day,

423
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,548
my man, whether you make it or you don't,

424
00:14:32,548 --> 00:14:34,156
the fact that your great great grandkids

425
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:35,812
are gonna be able to watch that film

426
00:14:35,812 --> 00:14:37,629
is unbelievable.

427
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:38,700
It's

428
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,776
I didn't get to know either
one of my grandfathers,

429
00:14:40,776 --> 00:14:41,900
they both died,

430
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,733
right?

431
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:43,718
Before I got to know them.

432
00:14:43,718 --> 00:14:45,405
You know how cool it would be to have

433
00:14:45,405 --> 00:14:46,740
all that film on them?

434
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,822
So, you might be thinking about vlogging

435
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:52,308
as narcissistic and
somebody's being a charlatan.

436
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,054
You're fuckin' short sighted.

437
00:14:54,054 --> 00:14:55,268
If you're not vlogging,

438
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:56,836
you're taking something very special away

439
00:14:56,836 --> 00:14:58,420
from your future family.

440
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,093
(audience applauds)

441
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:02,926
Tampa!

442
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:05,620
Thank you so much!

443
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,453
(audience cheers)

444
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,596
- [Audience Member] Can you
take a picture with me, Gary?

445
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:15,180
- Yeah, let's do it.

446
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,013
- [Audience] Gary!

447
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:17,096
Gary, please!

448
00:15:18,177 --> 00:15:19,094
Right here!

449
00:15:20,526 --> 00:15:22,722
Gary, right here, please!

450
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:23,555
Thank you!

451
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:25,457
- [Man] Okay Gary,

452
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:26,290
good luck!
- [Gary] Thanks,

453
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,123
you're so nice, bye guys, thank you.

454
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:27,956
- [Man] Thank you.

455
00:15:27,956 --> 00:15:30,347
- [Gary] Awesome, bye guys.

456
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:31,180
Iris!

457
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:33,366
Guys, I gotta bounce.

458
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,597
- [Man] Gotta back up,
gotta back up, guys.

459
00:15:34,597 --> 00:15:35,592
Excuse me, excuse me.

460
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:37,175
- [Gary] Thank you.

461
00:15:39,975 --> 00:15:41,743
- [Man] Gotta go, gotta go, guys.

462
00:15:41,743 --> 00:15:43,176
Got it.

463
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,714
See ya!

464
00:15:44,714 --> 00:15:45,703
Bye, guys!

465
00:15:45,703 --> 00:15:46,623
Thank you, bye bye.

466
00:15:46,623 --> 00:15:47,456
- [Female] Love you, Gary.

467
00:15:47,456 --> 00:15:48,289
- One life.

468
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:49,295
Do something about it.

469
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:50,128
Thank you.

470
00:15:53,279 --> 00:00:00,000
(laughs)
