00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,410
gazillion dollars I'm gonna do a show

20
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,129
and break down every element about the

21
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,140
show and how you turn it into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a business</font>

22
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,270
this should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really neat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm really</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">excited about this i don't even know</font>

24
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's about to happen it's been an idea</font>

25
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,469
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> running through a mine my show is</font>

26
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,059
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this it's gonna be called</font>

27
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the baseball card</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our I thought of this</font>

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,250
even you can come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ian's prepping Wine</font>

29
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,520
Library TV my idea is you would call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

30
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,379
the baseball card<font color="#E5E5E5"> show right we're to</font>

31
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,090
baseball card our and what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

32
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">is five days a week you would open up an</font>

33
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">old school pack of cards why I like this</font>

34
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,510
idea number one I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the investment</font>

35
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,610
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very minimal here's why I think</font>

36
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,220
that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got about 10 to 15 to 25</font>

37
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,229
episodes in that you'd be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

38
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:21,270
sponsors fans would send you in packs

39
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,729
and you could buy so many cheap packs on

40
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:25,170
ebay this day so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I was</font>

41
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about you can go on and buy box</font>

42
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,439
of cards for four or five bucks you know

43
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that gives you 24 packs that's 24 shows</font>

44
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,610
four weeks right for ten fifteen dollar

45
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,049
investment of course you want a little

46
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,640
variety but you could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one pack</font>

47
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,530
but what's really neat is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

48
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,000
quickly you would have fans sending

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,920
impacts my fans sent me in these packs

50
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,930
which I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple more of the NP you</font>

51
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,220
do me favor grab some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the boxes that</font>

52
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,920
i have up back there behind the couch so

53
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,600
a fancy mean that's how i started doing

54
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,460
it on the show the idea that showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

55
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,869
the baseball<font color="#CCCCCC"> card hours you'd open up a</font>

56
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:54,119
pack of cards each day of course not

57
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,100
knowing so the suspense factor for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

58
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,020
show<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would be very cool thanks</font>

59
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,750
see the best man so you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had a fan</font>

but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy so you</font>

00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,530
always have a suspense angle which i

150
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,690
think is great for television anyway I'd

151
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,770
be like all right we got one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these I</font>

152
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,820
remember these are like two<font color="#CCCCCC"> three four</font>

153
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">or five bucks each when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I first hit the</font>

154
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,820
scene<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into it and what's</font>

155
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,290
great about doing the sports card show

156
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,880
is you can go into sports in general to

157
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,280
geoff gray you know and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

158
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">say something like you know from the Red</font>

159
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,710
Sox you say you know what I don't

160
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,180
remember Jeff grade but you know is this

161
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,680
a great example of why the Red<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sox are</font>

162
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,240
now winning World Series with Beckett

163

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,450
current<font color="#E5E5E5"> events and sports so for me this</font>

166
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,860
would be great<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I can talk about</font>

176
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,860
Rays weren't in baseball yet so like

177
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,200
it's always giving you content

178
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,150
opportunities now you go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rafael</font>

179
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">Palmeiro right into the steroids issue</font>

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,090
Holograms it's nice to see an ace

186
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,710
hologram and then you could talk about

187
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">Willie McGee how he look like an alien</font>

188

274
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,059
yeah you know what the move is all real

275
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,708
so authentic baby didn't have to move I

276
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,899
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably go like you know if I had</font>

277
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:43,979
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> camera</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> man but if I didn't I'd</font>

278
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,240
probably pick it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and be like that is</font>

279
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,220
the greatest moment in John Starks

280
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,540
career as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see I've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a John</font>

281
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,460
start poster when he dunks on all the

282
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,100
I was at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the game anyway so I go back</font>

283
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I cook oh I got a rookie card now</font>

284
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,420
there's so many other cool things you

285
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,780
can do for example ebay has an affiliate

286
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,670
program right a bring one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> cards</font>

287
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,230
after you're done taping let's say the

288
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ron how not run out go on Howard rookie</font>

289
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,700
card was still worth two bucks because I

290
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,050
know cards are really depreciate in

291
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,670
value but let's say was or if I got a

292
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,080
Nolan Ryan signed it might not be worth

293
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,610
500 like used to be but even if its

294
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,710
twenty bucks I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> in theory on this</font>

295
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,480
show just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I do with wine library TV</font>

296
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,400
have the wines<font color="#CCCCCC"> link below</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end of</font>

297
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,870
show saying and if you want any of these

298
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,400
cards<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we're not gonna sound</font>

299
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,990
because we love them but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

300
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,180
