1
00:00:02,016 --> 00:00:03,794
- Many years ago, this young man said,

2
00:00:03,794 --> 00:00:04,627
"Let's do a vlog."

3
00:00:04,627 --> 00:00:05,957
I was like, "Okay."

4
00:00:05,957 --> 00:00:08,018
This is episode 400.

5
00:00:08,018 --> 00:00:09,703
What's up, vlog?

6
00:00:09,703 --> 00:00:11,520
I like calling you vlog, by the way.

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,671
What's up, vlog?

8
00:00:12,671 --> 00:00:13,605
I'm just not romantic about

9
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:14,776
anything that happened yesterday.

10
00:00:14,776 --> 00:00:17,518
90% of people default
into looking behind them

11
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,093
instead of looking ahead of them.

12
00:00:19,093 --> 00:00:20,527
♪ There's a moment ♪

13
00:00:20,527 --> 00:00:22,108
Can you understand that
you're asking to live

14
00:00:22,108 --> 00:00:26,840
a top 1% life in a 7.7
billion person world?

15
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,763
People's fears are
predicated on other people.

16
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,115
Stop looking for permission.

17
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:32,228
And so, I just don't understand

18
00:00:32,228 --> 00:00:34,047
why people are living
their lives like that.

19
00:00:34,047 --> 00:00:36,233
Most of all, nothing's gonna happen

20
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:37,880
unless you do something, please!

21
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,613
If you then wrap your head around

22
00:00:39,613 --> 00:00:42,097
what you're actually aspiring to do.

23
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:44,636
Like, what do you think's going on here?

24
00:00:44,636 --> 00:00:46,276
(cheering)

25
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:48,114
I mean it, I take shit in a super macro.

26
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,787
Like, I'd much rather be me than this

27
00:00:49,787 --> 00:00:52,315
fucking ugly green carpet.

28
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:54,313
I think I just wanna play
until I die, you know?

29
00:00:54,313 --> 00:00:55,810
And that's why I can see
when somebody likes it,

30
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,169
no matter what the fuck it is.

31
00:00:57,169 --> 00:01:00,298
You never get to cash
out and buy the Lambo.

32
00:01:00,298 --> 00:01:02,288
The game is the fucking Lambo.

33
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:05,879
Once you love the game,
whatever that is, you win.

34
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:06,877
It's a whirlwind.

35
00:01:06,877 --> 00:01:08,154
Vlog, I didn't drop it.

36
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:10,300
I'm just trying to make
it more binary for people,

37
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,671
which is are you happy or are you not?

38
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:14,387
And if you're not, why?

39
00:01:14,387 --> 00:01:15,638
Life's about choices, brother.

40
00:01:15,638 --> 00:01:18,412
Who the hell's permission
are you looking for

41
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:19,310
to do your thing?

42
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,801
Like, figuring yourself
out, ask that person out,

43
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:23,774
quit that fucking bullshit job.

44
00:01:23,774 --> 00:01:25,321
The punchline is self-awareness, man.

45
00:01:25,321 --> 00:01:27,421
I'm not gonna tell them, "Go do this."

46
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,229
I don't know them, I don't know you.

47
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:30,257
Do you.

48
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,207
You know you.

49
00:01:31,207 --> 00:01:32,878
Stop being scared of who you are.

50
00:01:32,878 --> 00:01:36,257
If you love it so much,
then you wouldn't be here,

51
00:01:36,257 --> 00:01:38,751
so you don't love it enough, so fuck that.

52
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:39,584
(cheering)

53
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,094
You can always get another bullshit job.

54
00:01:42,094 --> 00:01:43,115
The grass, man.

55
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:44,581
That grass is green as shit

56
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:45,972
on everybody else's lawn.

57
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:50,261
Indecisiveness, sitting on it,
not doing anything about it,

58
00:01:50,261 --> 00:01:51,438
is just not an option.

59
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:53,400
The hard work is the most controllable.

60
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,873
Stop asking for permission.

61
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:56,997
I got shit on for not
being the wine guy anymore

62
00:01:56,997 --> 00:01:59,249
when I started talking about business,

63
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:00,578
until I did it.

64
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:05,284
I am stunned by how many
people have the ambition,

65
00:02:05,284 --> 00:02:08,348
and their mouth is running to
what they're gonna accomplish,

66
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:10,590
and their actions don't map to it at all.

67
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:12,995
You know, just either gonna
will yourself to victory or not.

68
00:02:12,995 --> 00:02:14,204
Mindset and execution,

69
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:16,311
clouds and fucking dirt, motherfuckers.

70
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:17,491
Clouds and dirt.

71
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:18,789
Make of this here the moment

72
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:20,515
that you finally make 2018

73
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,577
the year when you start
living your fucking life.

74
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:23,610
How much do you need?

75
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,408
- Right now, I need 15 grand.

76
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,424
- I'm in.

77
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:27,304
- I'm sorry, what?

78
00:02:27,304 --> 00:02:28,428
- I'll pay for the whole thing.

79
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:30,123
- Get the fuck outta here.

80
00:02:30,123 --> 00:02:31,678
Is this tape rolling?

81
00:02:31,678 --> 00:02:32,956
- The problem is, in entrepreneurship,

82
00:02:32,956 --> 00:02:35,180
especially modern day entrepreneurship,

83
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,391
we do not celebrate the game.

84
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:40,091
We're putting the riches on a pedestal.

85
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:41,804
I don't think people have really audited

86
00:02:41,804 --> 00:02:45,177
how much down time they
have if they want it.

87
00:02:45,177 --> 00:02:46,221
I'm tired.

88
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:49,757
What happens when you
stay curious and humble

89
00:02:49,757 --> 00:02:51,636
is you start listening.

90
00:02:51,636 --> 00:02:53,807
When you start listening and executing,

91
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:57,172
it allows you to have the
audacity to start talking.

92
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:58,989
That is a good strategy.

93
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:01,382
I feel when I lose or
things don't go my way

94
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:02,759
that I truly deserve it.

95
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:05,824
If I'm gonna enjoy the
fruits of the victories,

96
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:08,874
I have to learn from the
things that I fucked up on,

97
00:03:08,874 --> 00:03:10,398
'cause you have to respect the game

98
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,799
more than you respect yourself.

99
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,296
I sit here and I say "nothing to lose,"

100
00:03:13,296 --> 00:03:16,000
and the person watching on
YouTube right now is like,

101
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,350
"What the fuck's he talking about?

102
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,090
"He has so much stuff."

103
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,082
I don't have anything to lose

104
00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:22,395
'cause the stuff is not
what I'm playing for.

105
00:03:22,395 --> 00:03:24,038
People get too fancy.

106
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,427
They buy an expensive
car and a second home,

107
00:03:26,427 --> 00:03:29,413
and now they're stuck,
'cause they have a mortgage,

108
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:31,399
and they have to pay for those things.

109
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:33,003
I don't say this stuff in theory.

110
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:37,055
This is not theory for me,
this is not intellectual.

111
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:39,230
This is practical reality.

112
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,999
Everybody talks about content, right?

113
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:43,023
What content, what content, what content?

114
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,427
Nobody's talking about community.

115
00:03:44,427 --> 00:03:45,995
It's about the other person, man.

116
00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:47,524
Run the marathon, not the sprint.

117
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:49,423
I realize what's going on here.

118
00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:50,458
One life.

119
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,491
I realize that I'm living like

120
00:03:53,491 --> 00:03:56,244
this is our only at bat,
and most of you aren't.

121
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:59,693
Everybody's just like, trying
to close on the first move,

122
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:02,214
and it never works, not in the long term.

123
00:04:02,214 --> 00:04:05,714
Negativity and tactics
win in the short term.

124
00:04:05,714 --> 00:04:10,181
Positivity and merit and
mistake win in the long term.

125
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:11,931
You're just not patient.

126
00:04:11,931 --> 00:04:14,071
Like, if you're feeling any angst,

127
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:15,515
it's because you don't love the process

128
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:17,402
more than the results.

129
00:04:17,402 --> 00:04:20,168
You're thinking about
$10,000 a month in Ad Sense

130
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:22,225
instead of loving the fucking dirt.

131
00:04:22,225 --> 00:04:25,359
Like, once you let the math
take over the art, you're dead.

132
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:26,942
Like, the soul has to come first.

133
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:28,308
You have to be thoughtful.

134
00:04:28,308 --> 00:04:30,441
You can't just throw it
up there and be like, ugh.

135
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:33,858
But if it ever trumps the soul, you lose.

136
00:04:34,922 --> 00:04:37,732
This becomes available
when you become great

137
00:04:37,732 --> 00:04:39,044
at something like this.

138
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:40,944
The problem for everybody right here

139
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:42,233
is they're trying to do all this

140
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:44,800
before they got great at this.

141
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,770
Patience.

142
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,938
- Yeah, patience, literally.

143
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:48,260
- Fucking patience.

144
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,670
Well then, all of a sudden,

145
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,290
all the bullshit that comes along with it

146
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,676
makes a hell of a lot more sense.

147
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:54,920
Everybody just thinks
they're entitled to it.

148
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,618
It's about leaving money on the table

149
00:04:56,618 --> 00:04:57,832
in the short term, my friend.

150
00:04:57,832 --> 00:04:58,790
The biggest problem is so many of you

151
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,292
sell shit you don't believe in.

152
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:01,931
You're just doing it
for the fucking money.

153
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:04,035
You're gonna fucking lose,

154
00:05:04,035 --> 00:05:04,868
and that I don't like.

155
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:05,853
I think that people don't understand

156
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:08,220
how much they're gonna
regret when they're older.

157
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,781
Are you self-aware enough
of what kind of founder

158
00:05:11,781 --> 00:05:14,349
or entrepreneur are you?

159
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:15,437
I don't like when people think

160
00:05:15,437 --> 00:05:17,770
I'm a futurist or disrupter.

161
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:20,556
I don't think I am.

162
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:23,322
I actually think all I am
is just very practical.

163
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:25,847
And do you know how to surround yourself

164
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:28,725
with the things that you
need to be successful,

165
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:31,260
instead of blindly thinking
you can do everything?

166
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,961
Just very grateful for
the life that I'm living,

167
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:35,084
and more importantly, for the attention

168
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,034
that you guys give me,

169
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:37,441
and so I hope you have a wonderful day.

170
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:38,274
This shit's binary.

171
00:05:38,274 --> 00:05:39,820
Either you're a good
person or a bad person,

172
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,304
either you've got talent or you don't.

173
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:44,437
If you're a good person,
you got talent, you win.

174
00:05:44,437 --> 00:05:46,795
If you're the other part, you've lost.

175
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:49,795
Everybody is trying to mitigate risk

176
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:53,492
and hedge against vulnerabilities.

177
00:05:53,492 --> 00:05:55,395
I run into them.

178
00:05:55,395 --> 00:05:57,978
I run right the fuck into them.

179
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,913
I run right the fuck into them.

180
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:07,841
Bye, guys!

181
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:12,295
There's a level of binary,
it's truth or it's not,

182
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:14,260
in hip-hop that I'm obsessed with.

183
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,535
Fucking do the right thing.

184
00:06:15,535 --> 00:06:17,276
Everybody's worried about themselves.

185
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,589
The best way to worry about yourselves

186
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:19,917
is to do for other people.

187
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:24,542
Shane, I'm gonna fly you to
New York City, to VaynerMedia,

188
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:28,349
and you're gonna spend a
day with me and my team,

189
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:29,463
and we'll show you what works.

190
00:06:29,463 --> 00:06:32,240
(cheering)

191
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,233
But I promise you this,
it's practical as fuck.

192
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:36,690
The world don't lie.

193
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,409
Everything I say is gonna
happen to me happens.

194
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:41,242
Let's go.

195
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:42,812
High, low, fuck the middle.

196
00:06:42,812 --> 00:06:43,685
That's what it is though.

197
00:06:43,685 --> 00:06:45,927
The middle is where everybody's losing.

198
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:48,150
Slow it down, pick one, do it for a year,

199
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,201
and then adjust.

200
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,860
Like, that's where everybody's losing.

201
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,536
There's just nothing like the beginning

202
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:54,986
of building a fucking monster.

203
00:06:54,986 --> 00:06:58,262
If you don't love it for the loving it,

204
00:06:58,262 --> 00:07:00,179
and it's about the money, you've lost.

205
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:03,606
I wanna build the biggest
building in town ever

206
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:05,803
by just building the
biggest building in town,

207
00:07:05,803 --> 00:07:07,546
while I think most people try to tear down

208
00:07:07,546 --> 00:07:09,107
everybody else's building.

209
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:12,086
So, I think positivity and good

210
00:07:12,086 --> 00:07:14,464
is practical advice to building an empire.

211
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:16,018
If you got it like that.

212
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:16,851
- You gotta go.

213
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:17,724
- [Gary] You gotta go.

214
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:19,876
I feel like I'm open
source entrepreneurship.

215
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:22,173
I'm free, and I'm
putting out my best shit.

216
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:23,485
Just fuck it, I'm like yes,

217
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,909
and I can leave and go
fucking fly to LA right now,

218
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:28,794
because the next three hours is yes.

219
00:07:28,794 --> 00:07:31,743
You can't stop winners
from winning, my friends,

220
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,992
and then you can educate the other 99%

221
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:35,497
and get all the admiration,

222
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,274
and leave a wonderful legacy,

223
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:38,995
and live a fulfilled life.

224
00:07:38,995 --> 00:07:39,902
That's the model.

225
00:07:39,902 --> 00:07:41,013
It should be.

226
00:07:41,013 --> 00:07:42,923
Doing the right thing is
always the right thing,

227
00:07:42,923 --> 00:07:43,962
always and forever.

228
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:46,960
Nobody is putting on marathon sneakers.

229
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,292
Everybody wants to be a sprinter.

230
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:49,924
Everybody wants it tomorrow.

231
00:07:49,924 --> 00:07:52,449
It's the grind, it's the message,

232
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:53,867
it's doing the right thing.

233
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:55,636
Embrace the chip on your shoulder,

234
00:07:55,636 --> 00:07:59,131
and expand on it, and triple down on it,

235
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:02,131
and really use it to your advantage.

236
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,957
- Be willing to work
harder than the next guy,

237
00:08:05,957 --> 00:08:08,211
take more pain than the next person,

238
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:09,089
and just don't stop.

239
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,378
- Eat shit.
- And don't quit.

240
00:08:11,378 --> 00:08:13,380
That's it, and if you're not doing that,

241
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,721
you're gonna finish second or third.

242
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:17,187
- It's wen you're in your fucking zone,

243
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:18,085
when you're doing your thing,

244
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:18,931
you're not scared of anything.

245
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,586
Even being in the middle of the road,

246
00:08:20,586 --> 00:08:23,019
just walking at it, you're
just not fucking scared.

247
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,923
I'm just feeling great, and I wish you

248
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:26,923
the ability to be in your fucking zone.

249
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:31,340
Our ambition to be great is
driving this whole thing.

250
00:08:32,673 --> 00:08:35,302
Where it just clicks, you
understand all the variables,

251
00:08:35,302 --> 00:08:36,847
you know all the moves.

252
00:08:36,847 --> 00:08:38,107
It's the reps.

253
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:39,788
You've seen it before,
you've seen it before,

254
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,712
you've seen it before.

255
00:08:41,712 --> 00:08:45,795
That's where I'm at, that's
where I'm fucking at.

256
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:48,417
Rebecca, thank you, she's
done a great interview.

257
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:49,623
- Thank you for having us.
- You guys will see it.

258
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:50,456
You're welcome.

259
00:08:50,456 --> 00:08:52,135
Episode 400, I hope you enjoyed it.

260
00:08:52,135 --> 00:08:54,565
Just put this in my face and
wanted me to close it out.

261
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:56,069
I don't have anything to say.

262
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,402
I'll see you in episode 500.
