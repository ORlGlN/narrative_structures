271
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,990

00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,810
if you're a business person or you've

304
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,130
ambitions or you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run for office</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and YouTube and SoundCloud and and and</font>

308
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,030
and do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the spectacles will</font>

309
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,940
help snapchat I do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think here's here's</font>

310
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,570
my big macro POV<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this snapchat is the</font>

311
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,360
first social network<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has a chance</font>

312
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,540
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a brand people think about</font>

313
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,000
snapchat the way they think about yeezys

314
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,610
the way they think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> SoulCycle the</font>

315
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,770
way they think about starbucks it's a

316
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,470
brand and that's what these glasses

317
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,030
these spectacles have a chance of doing

318
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,060
if they pop and they hold Wall Street

319
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,710
business people the people that roll

320
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,690
with me are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think and</font>

321
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,920
compare it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Instagram and Facebook</font>

322
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,690
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to compare to Instagram</font>

323
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,870
and Facebook and under armour and that's

324
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,160
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> place where they want to be because</font>

325
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,770
then all of a sudden money goes up then

326
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,210
all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> the company's worth more</font>

327
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,400
money and so to me as a company that has

328
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,290
IPO ambitions and one

329
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,339
to be on the stock market next year

330
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a big deal so saw that with the</font>

331
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,399
lines they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were crazy and they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worked</font>

332
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,130
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we love them I'm super big</font>

333
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,589
into consumer gadget rehab<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so I I</font>

334
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:49,199
think that they are what Google glass

335
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:51,420
should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been to consumers but the</font>

336
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,579
reason they were is google and this is

337
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:55,230
for everybody who's listening this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

338
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,180
great segue and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a macro</font>

339
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,670
level this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about knowing your DNA</font>

340
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,649
this is where you have to know yourself

341
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:05,040
let me explain google was started by two

342
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,970
nerds hmm so when they made a consumer

343
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,220
product<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was nerdy you ever see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

344
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,569
picture like like if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> listening</font>

345
00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:16,230
right now google google glass like you

346
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,759
don't want to hang<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kid yeah</font>

347
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,220
snapchat snap may expect that's made by

348
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">evan spiegel he's dating a supermodel he</font>

349
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:28,050
was a cool la kid he went you know like

350
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,110
he's 25 like the way they rolled it out

351
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,720
the vending machines like it was a PR

352
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,000
play it was like marketing its branding

353
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,550
it had a hell of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more nike in it</font>

354
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,760
than it had apple right and even apples

355
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,440
crossed over<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it has that but like</font>

356
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">snapchats out a whole different level</font>

357
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,779
and so I mean straight up if snapchat is

358
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,060
successful with this at scale and every

359
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,550
16 to 26 year old is wearing them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

360
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,449
into them and the real play is is

361
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:59,610
definitely summer jam and Coachella and

362
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,740
like when when the summer comes around

363
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,839
if East Coast kids are wearing those

364
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,880
glasses to their vacation then they've

365
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,500
got it and now all of a sudden you got a

366
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,389
debate are in the same way that nobody

367
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:11,040
thought that Nike would get knocked off

368
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,980
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> easies like our snap sneakers the</font>

369
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,620
hottest thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 24 months that's why</font>

370
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,269
this matters so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're</font>

371
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:20,880
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into brand not just tech platform</font>

372
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,769
and especially in the context of the

373
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:23,850
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would listen to something</font>

374
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people that listen to</font>

375
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:26,819
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this they understand</font>

376
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:28,709
flavor they understand swag and that's

377
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:31,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">not just about how good a product is and</font>

378
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,420
that matters yeah can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little</font>

379
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,370
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon and then we can talk about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm the bet not just gonna go no best</font>

431
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">Liana on a very but this sound like</font>

432
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,699
brain thinks I think to chess moves like

433
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,790
I know what's in front of us right but

434
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,540
what's that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I met my wife on JD in 2003</font>

435
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,040
if you went on<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet dating you were</font>

436
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,260
the biggest weirdest nerd live in your

437
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,449
mom's basement I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> scared cuz I</font>

438
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:46,040
already played the chess games and said

439
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,709
everybody's gonna do this got it yeah

440
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:51,230
and so that's it like that like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

441
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,970
what everybody listening has to do if if

442
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,829
you want to make money you pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention</font>

443
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:56,540
if you want to be rich<font color="#CCCCCC"> you pay attention</font>

444
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,189
to what's going on now if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

445
00:16:58,189 --> 00:17:01,340
wealthy like all time wealthy

446
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,390
you need to understand what's gonna

447
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,849
happen next after this and so we need to

448
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,680
understand what happens with these norms

449
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,569
and so I think Alexis a big deal I think

450
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody who's lucky enough to be able to</font>

451
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">afford</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that because that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a luxury in</font>

452
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,030
their home and uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see how</font>

453

543
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:16,320
happened to me in the last four years is

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,269
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't talk about shit I don't know and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">attention because you know what I talk</font>

547
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:24,210
no reason a time when I'm talking about

<font color="#CCCCCC">MA you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about Alexa you</font>

553
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,739
there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that understand</font>

554
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:35,879
it better than I do I've always

555
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:37,379
historically stayed away from music

556
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:39,210
because of all the legalities<font color="#E5E5E5"> and things</font>

557
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,799
of that nature and it made it scary for

558
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,590
me look it's tough to bet against Apple

559
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,330
because when you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the money in</font>

560
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,590
the world sitting in your bank account

561
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,989
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could buy Spotify</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> entitle 44 times</font>

562
00:20:48,989 --> 00:20:51,330
over right so that's one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

563
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,590
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give you an</font>

564
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,349
answer not stay away from it I you know

565
00:20:55,349 --> 00:20:57,239
it's funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> I never thought music was in</font>

566
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:59,279
trouble I thought the music<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

567
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:01,649
that was built where people that were

568
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:03,330
taking too much of the cut was in

569
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,539
trouble<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's good I like that I</font>

570
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,609
want the artists to have more leverage

571
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:10,229
artists have more leverage today than

572
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:11,970
ever because distributions been

573
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,009
commoditized the game's changed so you

574
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:16,139
go through it<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 20 year period where</font>

575
00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:19,049
it's scary people cry but on the other

576
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:22,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">side of it it's better and so I'm you</font>

577
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:25,139
know of course music<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me music is</font>

something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a snapchat was in trouble</font>

660
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:25,440
now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinda was wondering that as well</font>

661
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,360
with Instagram doing what they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

662
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,789
we asked about the spectacles<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do think</font>

663
00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:31,289
that is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring it back because</font>

664
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:33,059
his views are down on snapchat cuz

665
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,700
everybody's views are right right but my

666
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,320
real question is everybody's really

667
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,880
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how Twitter's in trouble</font>

668
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,870
could Twitter become my space yes ooh

669
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:46,289
that's scary for Twitter was scary for

670
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:48,720
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to uh I'm gotten used to getting my</font>

671
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,760
news<font color="#E5E5E5"> from Twitter great people used to</font>

00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,159
from MTV so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gotta realign and</font>

675
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:00,539
get our news from snapchat or Instagram

676
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:03,900
yep okay Twitter's in trouble shit and

677
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,280
by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way twitter is the reason I'm</font>

678
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,169
even sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> here as you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

679
00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:09,000
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first time I really popped back</font>

680
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,470
in the day I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was doing my wine show I</font>

681
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,760
jumped on Twitter I thought it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

682
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,230
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> big it was it not being way bigger</font>

683
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,659
and I really popped and transitioned in

684
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:17,280
the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> content said a wine content</font>

685

00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,000
it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that by the way</font>

00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:56,580
attention if snapchats really in trouble

926

928
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,290
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> in trouble if the views that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

931
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,320
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're not in trouble got it so</font>

932
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,449
what I'm gonna do is one of the reasons

933
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:13,980

936
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,040

943
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,340
didn't care about the business that's

944
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,080
fine but if I took a percentage of that

945
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,420
