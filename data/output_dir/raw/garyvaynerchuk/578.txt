1
00:00:00,212 --> 00:00:03,611
- [Gary] Some other, like, you
know, if they work for a leader

2
00:00:03,611 --> 00:00:05,741
like you, you know
what's gonna happen.

3
00:00:05,741 --> 00:00:09,042
If they go into another agency
they may not like it so...

4
00:00:12,152 --> 00:00:15,742
(triumphant rock music)

5
00:00:34,693 --> 00:00:36,233
What if I told you 
this is the last

6
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:38,028
Monday morning of your life?

7
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:48,725
- Plain bagels
and cream cheese,

8
00:00:48,725 --> 00:00:51,682
eggs ones toasted, 
plain is not.

9
00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:53,223
Plates and napkins.

10
00:00:53,223 --> 00:00:55,142
- This is literally why
we're gonna go out of business.

11
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:56,814
(group laughter)

12
00:00:56,814 --> 00:00:59,975
This is a complete 
waste of money.

13
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:01,994
Really excited
together this morning.

14
00:01:01,994 --> 00:01:06,743
Just trying to a lot more
face time with small groups.

15
00:01:06,743 --> 00:01:09,283
Just get to jam with different
peeps and things of that nature

16
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:11,593
so just wanted to jam.

17
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:12,774
See how you guys were doing.

18
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:14,055
See what's going on.

19
00:01:14,055 --> 00:01:16,834
See if we could shoot
the shit a little bit.

20
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:17,724
Talk about stuff.

21
00:01:17,724 --> 00:01:21,964
I think worst decisions I make
is when my word got in the way.

22
00:01:23,453 --> 00:01:26,473
So one thing I've been thinking
a lot about is the decisions

23
00:01:26,473 --> 00:01:29,234
I don't make that 
I'm pumped with is

24
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:32,368
because I'm not willing 
to go back on my word

25
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:36,705
and that is really easy

26
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:39,235
for me do it as VaynerMedia.

27
00:01:39,235 --> 00:01:42,324
Like as I always say, the only
thing constant is change so it's

28
00:01:42,324 --> 00:01:45,974
easy to say like, "Hey, 
we're eliminating project,"

29
00:01:45,974 --> 00:01:47,425
I'm almost secretly want to

30
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:50,555
bring project management 
back just to do it.

31
00:01:50,555 --> 00:01:53,516
Just to remind everybody
why I believe in that.

32
00:01:53,516 --> 00:01:55,784
So as a company 
and as a business

33
00:01:55,784 --> 00:01:57,745
I think it's my 
biggest strength.

34
00:01:57,745 --> 00:02:02,074
As a guy, it's the
biggest, it's the reverse.

35
00:02:02,074 --> 00:02:04,945
It's like the thing that matters
to me most is not to go back on

36
00:02:04,945 --> 00:02:08,883
my word and the problem is a lot
of times the other human being

37
00:02:08,883 --> 00:02:12,837
doesn't hold up their end of the
bargain but they don't see it.

38
00:02:12,837 --> 00:02:14,655
I feel great.
I feel great.

39
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:18,876
I feel like we're so
hungry to be great that

40
00:02:18,876 --> 00:02:22,234
we're hypersensitive 
to things that are...

41
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:25,464
We make things that are
C issues A+ issues

42
00:02:25,464 --> 00:02:28,413
because we just are winners.

43
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:30,551
I have a good idea.

44
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:34,563
A video series that is the
perfect wine if you're

45
00:02:34,563 --> 00:02:38,383
21 to 30 years old to start
getting into wine with and

46
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:41,332
then we target 21 to
30-year-olds in New Jersey.

47
00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:45,402
You know, the perfect wine to

48
00:02:45,402 --> 00:02:47,952
give to your boss if you work at

49
00:02:47,952 --> 00:02:51,503
and then let's find the top 
three New Jersey employers.

50
00:02:51,503 --> 00:02:54,003
Just like as a joke, 
things like that

51
00:02:54,003 --> 00:02:55,522
targeting people in New Jersey

52
00:02:55,522 --> 00:02:59,003
and it says free shipping 
and it's a video. It will work.

53
00:02:59,003 --> 00:03:02,502
About to go into
personal finance meeting.

54
00:03:02,502 --> 00:03:04,613
We will not be filming.

55
00:03:15,623 --> 00:03:17,594
- [DRock] L.A.
and Chicago.

56
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:18,377
- [Tyler] Chicago first.

57
00:03:18,377 --> 00:03:21,697
- [DRock] Chicago
for a day, at 3:50.

58
00:03:23,914 --> 00:03:25,047
Yes?

59
00:03:25,047 --> 00:03:28,257
- [Gary] Well now that 
I have a camera, you know,

60
00:03:28,257 --> 00:03:29,667
I'm settling the score.
Go ahead.

61
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,028
- [Woman] Can you not
shoot while you're driving?

62
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:32,957
- I wasn't.

63
00:03:32,957 --> 00:03:34,968
- [Woman] It was Saturday.
- No, I wasn't shooting.

64
00:03:34,968 --> 00:03:35,679
Justin was shooting.

65
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:36,489
- [Woman] Even
talking to camera.

66
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:37,408
I was a little
nervous about you.

67
00:03:37,408 --> 00:03:38,937
- People talk to other people

68
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:40,799
sitting in the 
passenger seat driving.

69
00:03:43,946 --> 00:03:46,197
- [Woman 2] Hey Gary!
- Hey guys! How are you?

70
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:49,289
- [Man] Good to see you.

71
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:50,387
Heading up to meet
you guys right now.

72
00:03:50,387 --> 00:03:51,515
- [Gary] Are you?
Good to see you, man.

73
00:03:51,515 --> 00:03:52,124
You well?

74
00:03:52,124 --> 00:03:53,586
- [Man] How are you doing?
- [Gary] Good.

75
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:06,219
This is the owner of the 
Miami Dolphins which is

76
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:09,438
a bad thing but a much better
thing is this is Stephen Ross.

77
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:12,867
My only non-family member
business partner in my life.

78
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:15,658
Somebody that I look up
to and everybody should.

79
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:17,089
Steve, say something nice.

80
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,298
- It's great being partners 
with Gary Vaynerchuk,

81
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:20,403
I got to tell you.

82
00:04:20,403 --> 00:04:22,335
- (laughs) I love it.
- It's a trip. (laughs)

83
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:23,857
- We're having a great lunch.

84
00:04:23,857 --> 00:04:25,639
He just said something 
that motivated me.

85
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,088
He's like, "I just
have all these ideas."

86
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:32,668
When you have this kind of fire
whether your two or 76 or 176,

87
00:04:32,668 --> 00:04:35,328
nothing beats the
entrepreneurial fire.

88
00:04:35,328 --> 00:04:36,439
I love it.

89
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,987
Steve, five wins in a
row for the Dolphins.

90
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,178
- Six.

91
00:04:44,796 --> 00:04:46,056
- [Woman 3] Hey Gary.
- [Gary] Hey, how are you?

92
00:04:46,056 --> 00:04:47,886
- [Woman 3] Good, how are you?

93
00:04:49,805 --> 00:04:50,647
- [Michael] How you doing?
- [Gary] Good to see you, man.

94
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:51,556
How you been?
- [Michael] Nice to see you.

95
00:04:51,556 --> 00:04:52,400
It's been a long time.

96
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,396
- [Gary] Yeah, it's
been a long time.

97
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:53,996
Great to see you.

98
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:57,927
I would love for this to be,
tell me straight up,

99
00:04:57,927 --> 00:04:58,768
how can I help?

100
00:04:58,768 --> 00:04:59,838
Like tell me what's
important to you?

101
00:04:59,838 --> 00:05:00,806
What are you thinking about?

102
00:05:00,806 --> 00:05:03,117
You may not know how I can
help but tell me the 4-1-1.

103
00:05:03,117 --> 00:05:07,447
When you think about this city
there is an absolute and based,

104
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:11,476
I can already tell your taste, 
just probably thinking

105
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:12,677
about John and other things and

106
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:15,027
then just think about
wineries, right?

107
00:05:15,027 --> 00:05:17,578
There is an absolute, 
here's what you need,

108
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:21,492
you need me to 
be boxed out of it.

109
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:24,478
If I wasn't me and had wine
relationships and didn't hear

110
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:26,308
this conversation but 
I was me as a human being,--

111
00:05:26,308 --> 00:05:27,538
- [Michael] Yeah.

112
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:29,958
- I need to be box
out of the first one.

113
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:33,177
It needs to be expensive
and I needed to miss it.

114
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:35,338
And then you have something.

115
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:36,988
- [Michael] To
create some demand--

116
00:05:36,988 --> 00:05:39,388
- 100%, it's never
about year one anyway.

117
00:05:39,388 --> 00:05:40,898
This is where
everybody fucks up.

118
00:05:40,898 --> 00:05:42,098
It's never about year one.

119
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:43,007
- [Michael] That part, 
I agree.

120
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:45,137
- [Gary] I know you do.
You know this.

121
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,548
I mean I know it
but you know it.

122
00:05:46,548 --> 00:05:50,208
You know it better than me in
reality, I know it in theory.

123
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:53,527
So that's why I'm going
with the, is it actually 1500?

124
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:55,599
Is it actually expensive?
- [Michael] Yeah.

125
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:58,668
- Is it actually, fucking, you
know, three, four, five, seven,

126
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:01,831
I don't know, thousand but
is it fucking ridiculous?

127
00:06:01,831 --> 00:06:02,888
Is it...

128
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:07,528
Snoop Dogg and some country star

129
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:09,249
that's huge right now 
are gonna perform--

130
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:11,599
- [Michael] Miranda Lambert.
- Great, Miranda Lambert while

131
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:13,959
you eat

132
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:17,969
Shake Shack burgers 
with '61 Lafite.

133
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:19,359
Like a double mashup

134
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,535
You see where I'm going?

135
00:06:20,535 --> 00:06:22,309
- [Michael] Burgers and
Bordeaux is a great pairing.

136
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:24,048
- Right. So, you see
where I'm going?

137
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:25,697
- [Man 2] Yeah.
- You can win that game.

138
00:06:25,697 --> 00:06:28,788
- [Michael] It's the ultimate--
- You can win, you need

139
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,858
basically, listen,
this city's super simple.

140
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,699
Every guy here wants to think
that the biggest (censored) and

141
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:38,378
if you can trick them
into that game, you've won.

142
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:41,609
And you reverse engineer that.
- [Michael] I wish I had that.

143
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,809
I know I don't have
the biggest (censored).

144
00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:45,238
- I'm definitely not 
even in the run,

145
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,630
I'm not even in the running.

146
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,950
- That's unfortunate.
(laughter)

147
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,660
Yeah. Hey, it's good to see you.
- Real pleasure.

148
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,279
We'll, like I said, the biggest
is, now we're just in flow.

149
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,520
- [Michael] Yeah.
That's cool.

150
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,709
- [Gary] Alright.
Real pleasure.

151
00:07:01,335 --> 00:07:04,720
Rainy day in New York City,
bunch of good meetings today.

152
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,660
Great meeting 
with Steve Ross,

153
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,260
you guys saw that clip.
Go ahead, don't be scared.

154
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,520
Don't be scared.
Don't be scared.

155
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,390
- I'm always eating 
when the camera's on.

156
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,458
Just a good buzz in the office,

157
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,625
actually do some B-roll,
DRock, right now.

158
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,526
Good buzz, everybody's
rocking and rolling.

159
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:24,645
Just a classic fucking Tuesday
in November doing our shit.

160
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:28,065
("Entertain You" by JKMK)

161
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:35,479
It was funny, it's so weird,

162
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:38,430
I wasn't even thinking 
about us later in the day.

163
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,409
I said to her, "Do you know 
how many fucking hipsters

164
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:42,899
"would wear 
(censored) on T-shirts?"

165
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:45,316
That was
literally in the meeting.

166
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:49,068
The answer of, "Hey, the brand
lift in itself through this

167
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:52,200
"execution is worth it plus
you're gonna make one third or

168
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,079
"two thirds economics on
whatever is built and here's a

169
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,699
"guy who's done it and he's done
it for Madonna and we're gonna

170
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:02,299
"do it for (censored), we're
gonna do it for (censored)."

171
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:03,360
The answer's yes.

172
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,762
- [Man 3] They're
all not incentivized.

173
00:08:04,762 --> 00:08:05,546
- [Gary] Correct.

174
00:08:05,546 --> 00:08:06,960
- [Man 3] To accept our message.

175
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,168
- So are you trying
to message to them?

176
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:09,896
- [Man 3] Yes.

177
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:11,384
- Let me give you a
really good piece of advice.

178
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:12,439
- [Man 3] Okay.

179
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:16,131
- Never sell to the unsellable.
- [Man 3] Yep.

180
00:08:18,114 --> 00:08:20,227
- What? You think you're
gonna be charming enough?

181
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:27,539
I think the question becomes
the fact that you don't have the

182
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:30,919
option to completely framework
the going around or different

183
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:33,139
things in the fact that 
you're stuck and you,

184
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:34,789
great that's very nice, 
Gary but that's

185
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,339
actually what 
I have to do for living.

186
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:37,758
- [Man 3] Yeah.
- The question is you

187
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:40,999
can't sell to them in
any normal way whatsoever.

188
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:44,769
- [Man 3] Our job is to try to
figure how message to them and

189
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:46,510
convince them
without selling to them.

190
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,829
That's the whole point.

191
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:50,129
- The question is who though.

192
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,525
'Cause if you're selling to your
contemporaries and they're being

193
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:54,964
blocked above them because
it's not in the profit margin

194
00:08:54,964 --> 00:08:57,529
interest of the organization,
that's like selling to these

195
00:08:57,529 --> 00:08:59,650
four characters when
I'm gonna stop them.

196
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,597
("Everything" by Kaiolyn)

197
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:17,800
- [Gary] Not that.

198
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,668
Okay.

199
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:22,018
I would see him in L.A.
for a little bit though.

200
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:24,508
- [Tyler] 6:40 you're in
and out in 35, 40 minutes

201
00:09:24,508 --> 00:09:27,592
and come back. Cool?
- [Gary] Cool. See ya.

202
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:32,487
Hey.

203
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,861
There's some good content today.

204
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,971
Think it could become an
extremely meaningful revenue

205
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:51,991
center and a place where I can
put the future leaders of my

206
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,331
organization to get closer to me

207
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:57,891
and to learn more 
autonomy and to...

208
00:09:57,891 --> 00:10:01,041
I just, the truth is a lot
more than you would think.

209
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:04,772
The three of us, the six of us
whatever it is are going to sell

210
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:08,352
something for $200,000 that
we used to give away for free.

211
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,991
I just I'm excited 
about that. (laughs)

212
00:10:13,991 --> 00:10:17,042
That's a good idea in business.

213
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:20,283
I'm really well.

214
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:23,665
I love your Instagram post.

215
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:29,468
Yes.

216
00:10:29,468 --> 00:10:32,873
So, listen, I want to 
have this over a dinner.

217
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:35,620
You're a important 
cog in my machine.

218
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,914
We had our most meaningful chat

219
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:41,494
five minutes into 
your tenure at a picnic.

220
00:10:41,494 --> 00:10:45,695
I'd like to set up one about one
and a half hour drinks or dinner

221
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:48,258
in January, mid-January

222
00:10:48,258 --> 00:10:50,008
to have this conversation.

223
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:53,918
The answer is we're gonna do
both and I want to really talk

224
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:58,237
about you and us and me and life

225
00:10:58,237 --> 00:11:00,738
and so I don't want to make this 
a 10 minute conversation.

226
00:11:00,738 --> 00:11:03,928
I think punting this to 
six weeks from today,

227
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:06,949
giving the preview that the
answer's gonna be both but

228
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:09,259
more importantly taking it to a
macro level and like really

229
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:11,228
getting aligned on the

230
00:11:11,228 --> 00:11:12,779
short-term and 
long-term futures.

231
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:13,998
I am very excited
about you, man.

232
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:16,160
I want to really
start building our bond.

233
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,419
That's a priority for me 
and '17 and this seems

234
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:21,169
like a great starting off point.

235
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:28,269
Yeah, and it will just, it's
also the lend itself to bigger

236
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:31,059
macro conversations that 
I think could be really fun

237
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:34,049
and inspiring on both ends.

238
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:37,810
Okay. So just set something
up with Tyler right now.

239
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,059
Alright? How you doing
otherwise, all good?

240
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:43,509
Love it, alright,
cool, sounds good.

241
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:45,890
I'll see you soon.
Alright, bye-bye.

242
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:52,313
- [Sam] Music intro, little
intro, I set you up.

243
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:54,178
- [Gary] Benrubi, 
do a little Instagram and

244
00:11:54,178 --> 00:11:55,624
Snapchat Stories for me.

245
00:11:55,624 --> 00:11:58,415
- [Sam] I set you up
with just a little history.

246
00:11:58,415 --> 00:12:00,055
Ready?
- Yeah.

247
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:02,280
- [Sam] You ever do this before?
- Once or twice.

248
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,849
Keep a quite close communication
with Brandon and my dad and know

249
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:06,994
a lot about what's
going on in the industry.

250
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:10,974
I think one of the things that's
really fascinating to me is much

251
00:12:10,974 --> 00:12:14,315
like I was very right about
Burgundy's explosion

252
00:12:14,315 --> 00:12:17,434
a decade ago, I'm positive--

253
00:12:17,434 --> 00:12:19,214
- [Sam] What preceded that?
Bordeauxs?

254
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:21,645
- Yes, and cult California cabs.

255
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:23,526
- [Sam] It shifted to Burgundy.
- Yeah.

256
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:24,955
- [Sam] Not
because of the Chinese.

257
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:28,243
- [Gary] A little bit for a few
minutes but just by logic.

258
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:29,153
- [Sam] Right.

259
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:33,973
- Once Parker became 
not the only voice in wine,

260
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:35,579
people started 
saying things like--

261
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,640
- We'll get to him
in a few seconds.

262
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,075
- Okay, I'm always
trying to set you up.

263
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:42,865
What happened was

264
00:12:42,865 --> 00:12:45,865
as Parker became one 
of the most important

265
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,976
voices instead the only voice
like he was for 15 years,

266
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:52,275
along with Wine Spectator,
what happened was people started

267
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:56,036
deploying logic and they said,
you know, there's 28,000 cases

268
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:59,035
being made of 
Château Lebron or Lafite

269
00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:01,605
and there's 330 of this

270
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:04,615
single vineyard Burgundy and so

271
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:06,954
just supply and 
demand kicked in.

272
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,556
- [Sam] So that
allure of collecting--

273
00:13:08,556 --> 00:13:10,966
- Don't forget Parker got
kicked out of Burgundy.

274
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:12,245
There was a lot of
controversy there.

275
00:13:12,245 --> 00:13:14,516
- [Sam] He was the Cali
cab and Bordeaux head--

276
00:13:14,516 --> 00:13:18,936
- And Rhone but he loved
Burgundy but the truth is

277
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:20,746
I won't speak to it 
because I don't even fully,

278
00:13:20,746 --> 00:13:22,035
I never fully knew the story.

279
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,065
I could recall it.

280
00:13:23,065 --> 00:13:24,776
He had a controversy
with a couple producers.

281
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:26,406
He stopped reviewing Burgundy.

282
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,336
That's why brought on 
Piore Rowanie way back when he

283
00:13:29,336 --> 00:13:33,513
first introduced another critic 
and so what happened was

284
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,542
Burgundy just wasn't that 
important to the

285
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:38,222
high net worth individuals 
of America and then

286
00:13:38,222 --> 00:13:40,772
they became it and then 
supply and demand kicked in.

287
00:13:40,772 --> 00:13:43,972
I believe the same thing
will happen to Barolo.

288
00:13:43,972 --> 00:13:49,123
So my big prediction here
on Heritage Radio Network--

289
00:13:49,123 --> 00:13:51,332
- [Sam] On the Grape Nation--
- on the Grape Nation--

290
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:53,893
- [Sam] where we're
bringing wine to the people.

291
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:55,742
- we're bringing
wine to the people--

292
00:13:55,742 --> 00:13:57,192
- [Sam] So the trend is?

293
00:13:57,192 --> 00:14:00,422
- the trend is if you're a
collector and you want to buy

294
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,481
some wine for your kids weddings

295
00:14:03,481 --> 00:14:05,671
or like the guy who 
hosts this show's

296
00:14:05,671 --> 00:14:07,163
made some good money 
on flipping some wine,

297
00:14:07,163 --> 00:14:09,126
he made some good bets,

298
00:14:09,126 --> 00:14:12,446
I would buy 
small tiny production

299
00:14:12,446 --> 00:14:16,067
highly rated, 
sought after Borolo.

300
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,761
Bruno Giacosa, red label.
- [Sam] Conterno.

301
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:22,633
- Conterno, single vineyards
because I believe that

302
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:24,376
Borolo will become

303
00:14:24,376 --> 00:14:26,756
a dominant wine 
of choice of the

304
00:14:26,756 --> 00:14:30,179
next generation 'cause 
it sits in between that

305
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:32,539
Pinot Noir-Cabernet cycle--

306
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,601
- [Sam] It has the
finesse and the complexities.

307
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:36,378
- Uh-huh but the power.

308
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:40,783
Rick who just made his first big
check at Goldman Sachs at 28,

309
00:14:40,783 --> 00:14:44,382
he's gonna buy at the restaurant
try to impress the girl that

310
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:46,282
he's trying to hook
up with that night--

311
00:14:46,282 --> 00:14:47,373
- [Sam] Good Borolo?

312
00:14:47,373 --> 00:14:51,280
- A tig, a Sassicaia, a Celeya.

313
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,923
He's not gonna say, "Hey baby,
check out this Aldo Conterno."

314
00:14:54,923 --> 00:14:56,423
- [Sam] Right.

315
00:14:56,423 --> 00:15:00,171
To me, that's where
the opportunity lies.

316
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:02,762
- [Sam] I think
you're right on that.

317
00:15:02,762 --> 00:15:05,552
- By the way, Rick's girlfriend
in that scenario is Sally.

318
00:15:05,552 --> 00:15:07,722
- [Sam] Looking at and drinking.

319
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:10,252
- So this is such iconic wine.

320
00:15:10,252 --> 00:15:13,082
First of all,
thanks for sharing it.

321
00:15:13,082 --> 00:15:16,238
You know the color's
black, dark, unbelievably--

322
00:15:16,238 --> 00:15:17,522
- [Sam] 13 year old wine.

323
00:15:17,522 --> 00:15:18,638
- which is incredible 'cause

324
00:15:18,638 --> 00:15:19,932
it usually loses some 
of that intensity.

325
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:21,313
- [Sam] There's
rust on the edge.

326
00:15:21,313 --> 00:15:24,682
- On the nose, it's got
hard-core black jam a little

327
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:26,503
hint of--
- [Sam] Heavy black.

328
00:15:26,503 --> 00:15:27,603
- really black, by the way.

329
00:15:27,603 --> 00:15:31,343
Like super juicy feels like
you're smelling red fruit,

330
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:34,781
blueberries, blackberries, black
fruit as well for that reason.

331
00:15:35,752 --> 00:15:40,253
A little hint of tobacco 
on the nose on the tail end

332
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:41,724
you get a little smoke.

333
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:43,584
- [Sam] I get a little
graphite, charcoal smoke.

334
00:15:43,584 --> 00:15:46,382
- Yep, 100% whether it's a
match or little bit tobacco,

335
00:15:46,382 --> 00:15:47,283
it depends on your nose,

336
00:15:47,283 --> 00:15:51,473
that's what you'll get. 
On the palate--

337
00:15:51,473 --> 00:15:52,863
- [Sam] Mouthfeel?

338
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:57,323
- [Gary] So this 
is interesting, right?

339
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,716
I do know for DRock, you and Ben,
you know, depending on where

340
00:16:00,716 --> 00:16:04,022
your wine palates are, you can
feel a little bit of tannins on

341
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:06,172
the backend but they're so soft.

342
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:08,522
- [Sam] They are very soft.
- And usually it's bitter.

343
00:16:08,522 --> 00:16:09,933
- [Sam] Tell people
what the tannins are.

344
00:16:12,153 --> 00:16:13,923
- That puckery, tough flavor

345
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:15,319
you taste when
he taste red wine.

346
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:18,360
- [Sam] The puckery flavor from
the skins, the seeds, the stems.

347
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,955
- Yeah, all the stuff
that isn't the fruit.

348
00:16:19,955 --> 00:16:22,185
As you can imagine, by the
way, very easy even if you're

349
00:16:22,185 --> 00:16:23,505
underage to learn this.

350
00:16:23,505 --> 00:16:25,984
Go take a grape,

351
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:28,764
eat the skin versus 
eating the actual grape.

352
00:16:28,764 --> 00:16:30,865
That transcends into red wine.

353
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,932
It gets bitter if you remember
the old bitter beer face

354
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:36,579
commercials, which I thought was
really funny by the way, anyway

355
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,921
nonetheless what's great about

356
00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:40,795
this is this is what 
aged wine's all about.

357
00:16:40,795 --> 00:16:44,464
This wine eight, nine, 10 years
ago would've felt hot on the

358
00:16:44,464 --> 00:16:45,622
back end 'cause the alcohol--

359
00:16:45,622 --> 00:16:46,749
- [Sam] It's calmed 
down a little?

360
00:16:46,749 --> 00:16:48,196
- Of course, so
this is an elegance.

361
00:16:48,196 --> 00:16:49,736
You know what this is?

362
00:16:49,736 --> 00:16:54,677
This is like a 42-year-old
distinguished gentleman

363
00:16:54,677 --> 00:16:58,246
who's got a little gray
coming in, right?

364
00:16:58,246 --> 00:16:59,327
- [Sam] Still handsome--

365
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:01,457
- Was an absolute like

366
00:17:01,457 --> 00:17:04,550
boy band rockstar 
handsome at 19, heartthrob.

367
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,910
- [Sam] Justin Timberlake.

368
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,849
- Timberlake
would be great comp.

369
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:09,938
42-year-old Justin Timberlake is

370
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:13,146
what this wine is 
and so I like that.

371
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:14,479
It's balanced, long finish.

372
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,349
I'm still tasting it and

373
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:18,248
much like 42-year-old 
Justin Timberlake,

374
00:17:18,249 --> 00:17:19,999
and he's happily married 
so I don't wanna wish

375
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:22,950
this on him, but still
has plenty of game. Right?

376
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,209
This wine can probably
last another 15 years easily.

377
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:27,362
- [Sam] In the bottle.

378
00:17:27,362 --> 00:17:28,559
- Having the
fruit of the bottle.

379
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,939
It's really good.

380
00:17:29,939 --> 00:17:32,169
- [Sam] Benrubi and you've been
listening to the Grape Nation.

381
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:34,297
We'll see you next time.

382
00:17:38,134 --> 00:17:39,820
That was great.
- [Gary] I love you, pal.

383
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,749
- [Sam] Were you good with that?
- [Gary] I was great with that.

384
00:17:41,749 --> 00:17:42,790
I'm glad we had that on tape.

385
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,750
- [Sam] Fun show.
- [Gary] Yeah.

386
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,445
- [Sam] Thanks for coming in.
- [Gary] Talk to you soon.

387
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:48,739
DRock, we got to go. See ya!

388
00:17:48,739 --> 00:17:49,669
That was fun.

389
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:50,969
Send me a link when it's live.

390
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:51,839
- [Sam] I'll send
you everything.

391
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,960
- Hey, thanks.
Nice job.

392
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,130
- [Gary] Real pleasure.
Thank you, brother.

("Jellyfish" by Jenny Renolds)

394
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,771
- 12:03 in the morning, 
leaving the office.

395
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:39,471
Like we do.

396
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:42,290
Good hustle, Tyler.
Good night.

397
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,521
Good day.
