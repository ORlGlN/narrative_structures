1
00:00:00,891 --> 00:00:03,422
- There is something serious

2
00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:07,335
about this podcast I did the other day.

3
00:00:07,335 --> 00:00:10,911
If you've not sat down
and seriously looked

4
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:13,128
at my content in a
little while or if you're

5
00:00:13,128 --> 00:00:15,183
somebody super deep into my content,

6
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:17,180
an incredible job here in this podcast.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,119
Going in a little different direction

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,756
about me and my mindset.

9
00:00:20,756 --> 00:00:23,043
I have a funny feeling
when I read the comments

10
00:00:23,043 --> 00:00:27,420
that this will be really talked
about and really analyzed.

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,543
I hope you enjoy it, I'm
very excited about it.

12
00:00:30,543 --> 00:00:34,270
Sit down, grab a cup of eggnog and enjoy.

13
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,853
(upbeat music)

14
00:00:40,783 --> 00:00:43,604
- [Female] A lot of people
try to get attention through

15
00:00:43,604 --> 00:00:45,532
social media and making a business of it.

16
00:00:45,532 --> 00:00:47,331
So what can be better than

17
00:00:47,331 --> 00:00:49,421
to talk to an expert on the subject.

18
00:00:49,421 --> 00:00:51,430
Welcome to this podcast, Gary Vaynerchuk.

19
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,335
How are you?

20
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:53,647
- I'm amazing, how are you?

21
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:54,878
- [Female] I'm fine, thank you.

22
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:55,865
- Good, thanks for having me.

23
00:00:55,865 --> 00:00:58,082
- [Female] Listen, how
does one become an expert

24
00:00:58,082 --> 00:01:01,124
on the thing that is
still growing and people

25
00:01:01,124 --> 00:01:03,051
still try to figure it out?

26
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:04,456
I mean, social media.

27
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:07,869
- By being a practitioner,
you know, there was a day

28
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:11,503
when painting was new and
the people that became

29
00:01:11,503 --> 00:01:14,208
good at it were the
ones that were painting.

30
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:17,134
It's amazing to me how many
people have opinions about

31
00:01:17,134 --> 00:01:20,536
Facebook or Instagram of LinkedIn
or making videos or doing

32
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:23,845
this kind of podcast and
getting people to listen to it.

33
00:01:23,845 --> 00:01:27,072
Whole lot of people with
opinions who've never done it.

34
00:01:27,072 --> 00:01:28,999
And so I believe the great
way to be great way at

35
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:31,879
anything is to be a practitioner.

36
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,957
You know people ask me
all the time, I make the

37
00:01:33,957 --> 00:01:38,032
analogy, you can read about
pushups, but if you want the

38
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:42,548
results that pushups give you,
you have to do the pushups.

39
00:01:42,548 --> 00:01:44,626
And I just think a lot
of people with business,

40
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:48,156
entrepreneurship and
specifically being a social media

41
00:01:48,156 --> 00:01:52,323
content creator or modern media
digital creator, read a lot,

42
00:01:53,543 --> 00:01:58,175
talk a lot, pontificate
a lot and don't do a lot.

43
00:01:58,175 --> 00:02:00,555
The way I figured out
how to have my podcast,

44
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:02,320
the way I figured out my
YouTube show, the way I

45
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,653
figured out everything I do is by doing.

46
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,008
And you're gonna get some bumps and you're

47
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,227
gonna make some mistakes.

48
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:11,329
I think most people don't
do because they're worried

49
00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:12,432
about what other people think.

50
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,675
- [Female] And who are they?

51
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,439
What kind of generation
are we talking about?

52
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,657
- Everybody, you know I think everybody.

53
00:02:17,657 --> 00:02:20,961
I don't think this is as
generational as people think,

54
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:25,064
I think this is more psychology
than it is, you know,

55
00:02:25,064 --> 00:02:28,026
none of the four people
sitting in this room,

56
00:02:28,026 --> 00:02:30,811
Babin's young, you're pretty
young, how old are you?

57
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:31,949
- [Sound Engineer] 35.

58
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:32,924
- Yeah.

59
00:02:32,924 --> 00:02:35,269
- [Female] Gary's talking
to our sound engineer.

60
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:38,195
- That's right, I bring
everybody into these podcasts.

61
00:02:38,195 --> 00:02:39,669
I like to break the walls
and visualize for you

62
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:40,888
everybody who's listening.

63
00:02:40,888 --> 00:02:45,567
Look, the three of us, 35,
it's not about how old you are.

64
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:49,027
I'm 42 and I feel more curious
and more understanding of

65
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:52,696
the culture and the game than
plenty of people that are 18.

66
00:02:52,696 --> 00:02:55,215
I think it's a mindset.

67
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:58,849
And so it's a very
interesting time to be alive.

68
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:01,508
There's so much opportunity and

69
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:03,098
I'm excited to be a part of it.

70
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:05,780
- [Female] But you are
a very, how do you say?

71
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,613
- Special.

72
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:09,379
- [Female] You're very special.

73
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:10,865
No but the thing is you have this

74
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:15,184
psychological skill that a
lot of people come to you

75
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:18,598
with a lot of problems and
they try to get advices

76
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,920
from you and you just give them advices.

77
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,451
What kind of skill is that?

78
00:03:23,451 --> 00:03:27,618
- That's psychiatrist, that's
psychologist, that's right.

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,083
If I was the son of me instead of me,

80
00:03:33,842 --> 00:03:37,592
I would've probably went
to a top five university,

81
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:41,713
and been a big time psychiatrist
or psychologist like, 100%.

82
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:45,068
Because I was born an
immigrant in a different

83
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:47,959
environment and probably
had a little bit too much

84
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,709
competitive, entrepreneurial DNA.

85
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,716
But yeah, I think it's
interesting as my life evolves,

86
00:03:54,716 --> 00:03:58,095
that some of my natural
skills are becoming more clear

87
00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:01,079
and it's less about being
a salesman or being good

88
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,994
at digital marketing.

89
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:06,338
I'm very comfortable giving
advice because I think I'm

90
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:10,007
undereducated and I
keep things very simple.

91
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:13,722
Like, human behavior
comes very natural to me.

92
00:04:13,722 --> 00:04:16,160
Which is why I've been
very good at predicting

93
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,482
what people are gonna do next.

94
00:04:18,482 --> 00:04:21,744
It's also the same skill
that allows me to know that

95
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:24,438
most of the people's issues
come from their parents

96
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:27,213
or the environment they were born in.

97
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:29,082
Most things are very simple.

98
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:30,997
We don't want to look them in the face.

99
00:04:30,997 --> 00:04:33,447
You know, Facebook's not changing us,

100
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:35,247
Facebook's not making us bad people.

101
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:38,474
Facebook's exposing that
we were bad to begin with.

102
00:04:38,474 --> 00:04:40,111
You know these are funny things to me.

103
00:04:40,111 --> 00:04:42,596
They're historical, I'm
a big fan of history.

104
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:44,918
It was the one class I
was actually decent at

105
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,600
and I think that's another
thing that's worked well for me.

106
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,933
This is just rinse and repeat.

107
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:52,255
What's happening right now
on Facebook and Twitter

108
00:04:52,255 --> 00:04:55,172
is the same reason that governments

109
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,966
when they want to be
dictatorships, control the media.

110
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,253
Because the media controls the mindset.

111
00:05:01,253 --> 00:05:04,753
And so I think my skill is human behavior.

112
00:05:07,035 --> 00:05:11,156
And I think my vice or my
intrigue on another part

113
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:14,823
of my life is building
business and I bought

114
00:05:16,207 --> 00:05:20,038
Bitcoin in 2014, not because I guessed.

115
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:22,569
Not because of anything else, but because

116
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:25,100
I could see what was gonna
happen in '17 and '18.

117
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,129
Yeah I made the joke
earlier about special but I

118
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:32,484
do feel special and I
don't say that with ego,

119
00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:34,562
I say that as a compliment
to my parents and to

120
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:36,478
my circumstance and to America and to

121
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:38,184
the Soviet Union, for that matter.

122
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:41,238
The circumstances of who I became

123
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:43,897
are far more the factor than me.

124
00:05:43,897 --> 00:05:46,230
But I do see around corners,

125
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,852
and not because I'm Nostradamus,

126
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:53,383
but because I deeply am consumer-centric.

127
00:05:53,383 --> 00:05:55,298
I watch what people wear.

128
00:05:55,298 --> 00:05:59,419
When haircuts change,
I'm fascinated by that.

129
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:02,356
I would've been great in fashion.

130
00:06:02,356 --> 00:06:04,109
If I had that gene.

131
00:06:04,109 --> 00:06:06,188
Like my daughter's very creative,

132
00:06:06,188 --> 00:06:08,556
and I can see she has a lot of me in her.

133
00:06:08,556 --> 00:06:11,737
I can see her being a
big time fashion player

134
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:14,384
in the future because if
she deploys her creativity

135
00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:16,671
to fashion and she can see around corners,

136
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:19,435
she'll be an innovator of style.

137
00:06:19,435 --> 00:06:22,778
And so yeah things are very simple to me.

138
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:27,022
- [Female] But social
media and the human brain

139
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:29,855
goes hand in hand with psychology.

140
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:33,727
- The human brain goes hand
in hand with everything.

141
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,466
Social media's very important
because it's communication.

142
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:40,251
You and I, right now,
are sitting in some room,

143
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:43,223
at some conference,
this amazingly handsome,

144
00:06:43,223 --> 00:06:46,323
talented, sound engineer
has a very small device,

145
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,483
doesn't look so complicated
to me, I wouldn't know

146
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:51,130
what to do with it, but it's not big.

147
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,661
I know that this whole enterprise here

148
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:57,109
is not costing a whole to create,

149
00:06:57,109 --> 00:06:59,640
and not costing a whole lot to distribute

150
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,440
if you guys know what you're doing.

151
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,342
It doesn't cost me a lot to
distribute on my podcast,

152
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:06,978
which is a top 50 podcast in the world.

153
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:10,774
That whole enterprise used
to cost millions of dollars

154
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:14,605
in studio costs, in distribution cost.

155
00:07:14,605 --> 00:07:17,624
We're living in the internet age.

156
00:07:17,624 --> 00:07:21,571
- [Female] Why don't people
get this more and foster?

157
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:24,903
- Because people look backwards
instead of looking forward.

158
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:28,015
90% of people default
into looking behind them

159
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:30,128
instead of looking ahead of them.

160
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:31,961
It's the human psyche.

161
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,283
I think most people are scared of change

162
00:07:35,283 --> 00:07:38,127
and they look for negatives.

163
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:41,064
There's people that are
trying to blame suicide rates

164
00:07:41,064 --> 00:07:44,037
on social media, it's laughable.

165
00:07:44,037 --> 00:07:48,158
The issue with suicide rates
in the world is bad parenting,

166
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:51,455
and many other variables,
and maybe social media.

167
00:07:51,455 --> 00:07:55,622
But to binarily blame a
media is silly and so I think

168
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,333
there's a lot of
technology fear mongering.

169
00:08:04,203 --> 00:08:06,850
One thing I like to say a
lot is that we put writing a

170
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:11,099
letter on a pedestal, but
kids that are texting are bad.

171
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,899
I think that's crazy.

172
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:16,997
The message is important, not
the thing that delivers it.

173
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:21,804
- [Female] You invested, as
you said before, you knew about

174
00:08:21,804 --> 00:08:25,380
Facebook before Facebook was big,

175
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,773
and invested in Facebook,

176
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,606
Twitter, Tumblr, Uber,

177
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:32,775
and you are a rich son of a gun.

178
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:34,203
- Yeah.

179
00:08:34,203 --> 00:08:36,722
- [Female] But how can
you inspire your kids.

180
00:08:36,722 --> 00:08:38,928
I mean you had a total different.

181
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:42,794
- I can't inspire them in
the way that I was inspired.

182
00:08:42,794 --> 00:08:43,978
- [Female] 'Cause they have too much?

183
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:44,979
- 100%.

184
00:08:46,382 --> 00:08:47,613
And they have other things.

185
00:08:47,613 --> 00:08:49,598
They have a father who's
gonna end up being famous.

186
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:52,698
And that might be good or bad.

187
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,405
First, the way I'm gonna
inspire my kids is to

188
00:08:54,405 --> 00:08:58,073
first do what I always do
which is audit who they are,

189
00:08:58,073 --> 00:09:00,511
not who I hope thy are.

190
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:03,774
I first have to deploy
self awareness and empathy

191
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:06,107
and understand who they are.

192
00:09:06,107 --> 00:09:07,861
So for my daughter who's
eight, I'm starting to

193
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:10,183
get a understanding and in
three or four or five years

194
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,145
I think I'm gonna have a
very good understanding.

195
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:14,757
I'm gonna inspire my two
children and what I try to

196
00:09:14,757 --> 00:09:16,800
inspire everybody who's listening to this

197
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,122
is I don't want them to become me,

198
00:09:19,122 --> 00:09:21,816
I only what one thing
for people that I have.

199
00:09:21,816 --> 00:09:23,859
Really, outside of health,
the only thing I wish

200
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:28,759
for people is them to love
what they do as much as I do.

201
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:32,242
When I do new podcasts or new
video shows, I love reading

202
00:09:32,242 --> 00:09:35,295
the comments of the
audience that don't know me.

203
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:38,430
Inevitably, 5% of the audience will

204
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,513
leave a comment that refers to drugs.

205
00:09:42,714 --> 00:09:45,233
If they want to be really
snarky, they'll say

206
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:46,650
cocaine, Ritalin,

207
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:52,672
they think that I'm on something

208
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:57,551
and I always reply, because
I've never tried smoking

209
00:09:57,551 --> 00:10:00,634
a cigarette, let alone done Adderall.

210
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:08,964
So they'll say cocaine,
and I'll reply gratitude.

211
00:10:08,964 --> 00:10:12,133
I'm so grateful that I do
what I love everyday, and what

212
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:15,048
I love for clarification, is
just being an entrepreneur,

213
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:19,657
playing, the challenges,
the risk, the excitement.

214
00:10:19,657 --> 00:10:22,002
- [Female] But you're also
high on your own energy,

215
00:10:22,002 --> 00:10:23,302
you have tremendous energy.

216
00:10:23,302 --> 00:10:26,135
- I have tremendous energy
because it builds momentum.

217
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:28,155
When you're doing what you
want to be doing for a long

218
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:31,069
period of time, it builds momentum.

219
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:34,099
I didn't have this same energy
in school, I hated school.

220
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:37,362
I was optimistic, I was
high energy, that's my DNA,

221
00:10:37,362 --> 00:10:40,160
but not like this, this is now a supernova

222
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,177
because now I'm 20 years
into being in my zone.

223
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:47,497
The breath of fresh air,
the exhale I had on the

224
00:10:47,497 --> 00:10:50,667
first day that I worked
at my dad's liquor store,

225
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:53,755
like worked, like there was
no more school ever again,

226
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:57,737
that (exhaled) was incredible.

227
00:10:57,737 --> 00:11:01,128
I will never replicate
that feeling again, I miss

228
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,310
that feeling, it's funny, I've
never talked about this out

229
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,609
loud, that might have been
the best day of my life in a

230
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:09,475
lot of ways, knowing that I
was embarking on the thing

231
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:11,936
that I was meant to do,
so if my children want to

232
00:11:11,936 --> 00:11:16,103
give away all my money, want
to paint in the Himalayas,

233
00:11:17,138 --> 00:11:21,445
want to start a shool, or
want to climb the mountain

234
00:11:21,445 --> 00:11:24,580
and be bigger than me, I
just wanna inspire them to be

235
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,786
themselves and support them mentally.

236
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:30,036
- [Female] But shouldn't you,
that didn't like the school

237
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:33,159
system at all, shouldn't you
be the one to start a school?

238
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,242
- Mmm Hmm, I sure should.

239
00:11:36,352 --> 00:11:37,989
- [Female] And?

240
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:38,930
- And I will.

241
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:39,763
- [Female] Call me.

242
00:11:39,763 --> 00:11:41,333
- You got it.

243
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,444
And by the way, I think i
am, and I've always dreamed

244
00:11:44,444 --> 00:11:46,720
of starting a school 'cause
I wanted to fucking stick

245
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,659
it back to them so that
we could build a school

246
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:50,749
for people like me.

247
00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:54,162
What's interesting is I'm
realizing I'm doing it now.

248
00:11:54,162 --> 00:11:58,144
I have an enormous amount of
10-15 year olds following me

249
00:11:58,144 --> 00:12:02,417
across YouTube and Instagram,
and I'm teaching them, boy.

250
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:04,518
Maybe I'm not teaching
them the way that people

251
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:07,548
think teaching is done,
but I am teaching them.

252
00:12:07,548 --> 00:12:09,197
And I see it.

253
00:12:09,197 --> 00:12:10,288
Oh, I have a great story.

254
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:13,202
I was flying yesterday from
Gothenburg to Stockholm and I

255
00:12:13,202 --> 00:12:17,068
sat with a man whose 18 year
old son is obsessed with me.

256
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:20,308
He lives in New Jersey, of
all places, small world.

257
00:12:20,308 --> 00:12:24,391
And he said that I, so
he's telling me everything

258
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:27,390
and I'm very flattered.

259
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,514
And he's a young man,
this father, he's 44.

260
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:32,800
I'm 42, but he has an 18 year old son,

261
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,236
and he's saying I was a
good student, my son wasn't

262
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:38,849
as good, but he wants
to be an entrepreneur,

263
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:41,635
and he lives at home
still, and everyday I walk

264
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,607
to work, come home, anytime
I'm going by him when

265
00:12:44,607 --> 00:12:47,278
he's out in his room and
working in the kitchen

266
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:50,784
or living room, I hear your voice.

267
00:12:50,784 --> 00:12:53,524
And then he turned to
me, very emotionally,

268
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:55,741
and he said thank you,
and it's kinda making me

269
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,947
a little bit emotional right now.

270
00:12:57,947 --> 00:13:02,208
He said, my son's such a
better man now because of you.

271
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,286
And then he started telling me reasons,

272
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:08,257
accountability, you know,
I'm teaching real stuff,

273
00:13:08,257 --> 00:13:11,566
not memorizing who the
fourth president was.

274
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:15,559
And then he talked about
me talking about my father,

275
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,394
and he said his son's
very competitive with him,

276
00:13:17,394 --> 00:13:19,936
and I was very competitive with my father.

277
00:13:19,936 --> 00:13:22,142
But I put out some content
about how I think about my dad,

278
00:13:22,142 --> 00:13:24,023
even though we're different,
even though there's a lot

279
00:13:24,023 --> 00:13:26,798
we don't agree with, and he
said to me that his relationship

280
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:29,654
with his son has fundamentally
changed since then.

281
00:13:29,654 --> 00:13:33,288
- [Female] What do you say
to these youngsters that

282
00:13:33,288 --> 00:13:37,293
make such an impact to
those who are listening and

283
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:39,894
maybe haven't heard you yet.

284
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:42,669
- I tell them the truth.

285
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:44,584
I tell them the truth.

286
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:46,419
Their parents aren't
telling them the truth,

287
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:48,671
their school isn't telling them the truth.

288
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,262
I tell them the truth.

289
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,270
I tell them a lot of
things they like to hear,

290
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,673
like fuck the system, forget
about what your parents

291
00:13:54,673 --> 00:13:58,400
want for you, this is your
life, do not live with regret.

292
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,316
And then I tell them other
truths they don't like

293
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:02,197
which is you're fuckin'
entitled, you haven't proven

294
00:14:02,197 --> 00:14:05,703
shit, stop being full of
shit, like life is long,

295
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:08,013
be kind, nobody gives a
shit if you have a Mercedes

296
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,125
or a Rolex, shut the fuck up, get to work.

297
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,958
I tell them the truth.

298
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:16,686
- [Female] Okay, I'm laughing
here, Tom is as well,

299
00:14:16,686 --> 00:14:20,853
because we have teenagers,
and you're right, anyway.

300
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:24,418
- And you know what, let's
hold onto that for a second

301
00:14:24,418 --> 00:14:27,715
because this could be very
valuable for your listeners.

302
00:14:27,715 --> 00:14:32,696
I'm fascinated by what you
just did to what I just said,

303
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:35,192
and how that plays out in my entire life.

304
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:37,027
When I go to Cannes for
the marketing festival,

305
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:39,558
and I go on stage and I
talk, and I talk about

306
00:14:39,558 --> 00:14:42,878
stuff nobody agrees with,
me, in the industry.

307
00:14:42,878 --> 00:14:44,910
But then at 2 o'clock in the morning,

308
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,986
they'll say to me after a couple
of cocktails, you're right.

309
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:51,249
When parents hear my
stuff, and they're smart,

310
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:54,072
they don't like a lot of
what I say, but they'll tell

311
00:14:54,072 --> 00:14:56,905
me, you're right, you just did it.

312
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,596
What I'm trying to figure out,

313
00:14:59,596 --> 00:15:03,219
is what makes one do
something that they know

314
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:06,330
isn't right, when they know what's right.

315
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,281
What is creating that behavior.

316
00:15:08,281 --> 00:15:11,845
What I think is happening,
is they're worried about

317
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,354
what other people think.

318
00:15:13,354 --> 00:15:15,189
I have a lot of empathy
for a 49 year old woman

319
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:17,325
raising two teenagers
in a neighborhood where

320
00:15:17,325 --> 00:15:19,322
she has a lot of friends,
where she believes in

321
00:15:19,322 --> 00:15:21,772
something, but she
doesn't do it because she

322
00:15:21,772 --> 00:15:25,069
doesn't want the scrutiny
from the other moms.

323
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:28,412
I understand, I just don't know why she's

324
00:15:28,412 --> 00:15:31,329
choosing herself over her children.

325
00:15:32,186 --> 00:15:33,741
I think about that stuff.

326
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:37,097
I don't want my kids to be entrepreneurs.

327
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:39,546
Too many people think of
their children as property,

328
00:15:39,546 --> 00:15:42,356
and as indicators of who they are.

329
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:44,562
And I understand that,
I get so proud when my

330
00:15:44,562 --> 00:15:47,337
kids do things, I get it.

331
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:50,471
I just don't think it's in
the best interest of the kids.

332
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:53,397
And so I'm trying to
have conversations that

333
00:15:53,397 --> 00:15:55,719
a lot of people aren't.

334
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:57,391
I just said that for the
last three minutes, because I

335
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:59,434
hope somebody on my vlog or
somebody on your podcast.

336
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:03,393
One, if one parent, one,
if one parent just got

337
00:16:03,393 --> 00:16:05,878
inspired in the last
five minutes, those kids

338
00:16:05,878 --> 00:16:08,165
lives are much better.

339
00:16:08,165 --> 00:16:10,870
You know how incredible that is?

340
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,098
That's what media is, that's
the world we live in today.

341
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,735
I would've never been known.

342
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:17,743
- [Female] But the thing you
said, get your shit together.

343
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:18,602
- Yes.

344
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,646
- [Female] I recognize
that I'm the daughter of

345
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,989
immigrants as well, so we hear that a lot,

346
00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:26,358
and I'm not saying that
immigrants are the best

347
00:16:26,358 --> 00:16:30,282
people on earth, because we
create a lot of good teenagers,

348
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:32,325
but there is something
when you have to fight.

349
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,938
- 100%, five fold.

350
00:16:34,938 --> 00:16:37,688
My kids can't be as hungry as me.

351
00:16:39,442 --> 00:16:42,055
I think the challenge that you and I have,

352
00:16:42,055 --> 00:16:44,655
as kids of immigrants, and
I'm an immigrant myself,

353
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:48,742
so I'm real close to it,
is I'm ideological about

354
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:52,492
the immigrant framework, I'm with you.

355
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:54,570
We know how lucky we are.

356
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,403
'Cause we're hungrier.

357
00:16:57,473 --> 00:17:00,056
We know it's good, it's better.

358
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:04,983
Entitlement and prosperity
has flaws on the back end,

359
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,876
but I think the mistake a
lot of people make is they

360
00:17:06,877 --> 00:17:11,032
try to fabricate the
reality of the situation.

361
00:17:11,032 --> 00:17:13,981
I see a lot of my rich
friends send their kids

362
00:17:13,982 --> 00:17:17,243
to Africa for two days and
think it's gonna change them.

363
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:20,993
I think what's better, is my
recommendation for anybody

364
00:17:20,993 --> 00:17:23,733
who's listening who
thinks their kids are in a

365
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:27,900
situation that is spoiled
or entitled or fruitful,

366
00:17:29,168 --> 00:17:32,024
my big thing is, I can't fake environment.

367
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:33,939
My kids live on the upper
east side of Manhattan,

368
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:37,039
go to private schools, have
friends who have private planes.

369
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,012
I myself, my daughter and
son went with me the other

370
00:17:40,012 --> 00:17:42,775
day, I went to buy jeans
and buy them some candy,

371
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:45,294
I took eleven selfies.

372
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:47,291
I could choose to be rude
to people and say I'm

373
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,613
with my family, but that's not in me.

374
00:17:49,613 --> 00:17:52,713
So I chose to do that, but
that's affecting my children.

375
00:17:52,713 --> 00:17:56,265
My daughter's like, you're
famous, you're a legend.

376
00:17:56,265 --> 00:17:58,947
And I can't fake their life,

377
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:01,711
but there is something I
think where you're going

378
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:04,218
that I think is super important.

379
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:06,947
I do think some things are non-negotiable.

380
00:18:06,947 --> 00:18:08,537
So my kids are gonna be
rich, and they're gonna

381
00:18:08,537 --> 00:18:10,627
be spoiled, they're not
gonna be as hungry as me.

382
00:18:10,627 --> 00:18:13,065
When I was 12 I asked
my mom to buy Nintendo,

383
00:18:13,065 --> 00:18:14,458
she said go buy it.

384
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,049
I figured it out.

385
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:19,961
I could do that to my
kids, but there's too much

386
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:22,237
surrounding the framework of our family

387
00:18:22,237 --> 00:18:24,234
that that's now where I'm gonna go.

388
00:18:24,234 --> 00:18:26,602
But where I am gonna go is the following.

389
00:18:26,602 --> 00:18:28,715
So for example, something
that is very politically

390
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:30,944
incorrect, is to hit your children, right.

391
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,313
Not a big thing that we do anymore.

392
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,229
I'm very comfortable saying
on the record, I will hit

393
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:39,396
my child if they ever, ever
use my and my wife's wealth

394
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,984
to be rude to another child.

395
00:18:42,984 --> 00:18:46,374
If my kids ever once, in
their life, make another

396
00:18:46,374 --> 00:18:50,008
kid feel bad 'cause me and Lizzy are rich,

397
00:18:50,008 --> 00:18:52,911
and they're using that to
make somebody else feel bad,

398
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:55,325
I will punch them in the face.

399
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:57,531
- [Female] I hope they
hear that, your kids.

400
00:18:57,531 --> 00:18:59,981
- You know what's even better,
it's better than hearing it.

401
00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:03,081
Whether they listen to
this podcast or the clip

402
00:19:03,081 --> 00:19:05,043
and if they use it, if they
ever hear it, it's gonna

403
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,506
matter a lot less than
the fact that it is our

404
00:19:06,506 --> 00:19:08,480
religion inside our home.

405
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,802
They've heard it, it's been heard.

406
00:19:10,802 --> 00:19:13,901
They don't even know it
yet, but it's established.

407
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:17,318
And I think being kind is non-negotiable,

408
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:20,798
I don't need them to be as hungry as I am,

409
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:23,097
'cause they're not going to be.

410
00:19:23,097 --> 00:19:25,500
I need them to be kind and I need them to

411
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,667
figure out who they are, and
then I need them to go all in.

412
00:19:31,781 --> 00:19:34,974
If they make paintings out of asparagus,

413
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:38,979
and make $8 a year, I
will be very proud as long

414
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:41,835
as they have as much
fire in their eye the way

415
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:43,298
that I do about my thing.

416
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:45,411
My fire turned into wealth, I get it.

417
00:19:45,411 --> 00:19:47,594
But there's a lot of people who have fire

418
00:19:47,594 --> 00:19:50,322
who do much greater
things than create wealth.

419
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:53,015
I will tell you, I have
much more fire to inspire

420
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:55,686
people and make them win.

421
00:19:55,686 --> 00:19:57,938
My personal wealth, once
I made $100,000 a year,

422
00:19:57,938 --> 00:19:59,238
I thought I was rich.

423
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:02,698
That was big, I was pumped,
I'm still pumped, $100,000.

424
00:20:02,698 --> 00:20:04,219
I can live very, right now.

425
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:06,216
- [Female] The first $100,000 is the best.

426
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:10,094
- Is big, I agree, and
so I don't like stuff.

427
00:20:10,094 --> 00:20:13,177
Like I don't need money for anything.

428
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:18,861
So if my kids become
lecturers, but only make

429
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:24,397
$73,000 a year, they're
gonna make me very proud

430
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:27,091
as long as they're fired up and happy.

431
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:28,890
- [Female] Let's continue talk about young

432
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,074
people but also business-wise.

433
00:20:30,074 --> 00:20:31,201
- Okay.

434
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:33,279
- [Female] There are a
lot of examples of brands

435
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,251
that are panicking,
believing that they are

436
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:39,804
facing their final days,
they buy consultants

437
00:20:39,804 --> 00:20:43,147
to analyze the social
media, and they still fail

438
00:20:43,147 --> 00:20:46,564
to reach out to millennials, for example.

439
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:51,948
And I think just to take an example,

440
00:20:51,948 --> 00:20:54,270
I think only one of five millennials has

441
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,801
tried a Big Mac from McDonald's.

442
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:58,356
- Yeah.

443
00:20:58,356 --> 00:21:01,549
- [Female] And I mean it
doesn't matter how much

444
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:05,216
social media they try
to expose themself in,

445
00:21:06,402 --> 00:21:10,569
it doesn't work and so
then McDonald's started to,

446
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:15,133
why doesn't this work, what do you say?

447
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:16,712
- Well let's start with
this, if VaynerMedia

448
00:21:16,712 --> 00:21:18,302
did the marketing for
McDonald's and they gave

449
00:21:18,302 --> 00:21:20,520
me carte blanche, five
our of five millennials

450
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,353
would try the Big Mac.

451
00:21:23,538 --> 00:21:25,036
I'm not joking.

452
00:21:25,036 --> 00:21:26,905
I think I can get every fucking person in

453
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:30,133
America, including vegan moms,
to eat a fuckin' Big Mac.

454
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:33,383
I don't think McDonald's big problem is

455
00:21:35,114 --> 00:21:37,819
the food trends, 'cause
they sell plenty of salads,

456
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:39,583
and they've got all sorts of reasons.

457
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,347
I think it's the marketing, I really do.

458
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:46,236
McDonald's spends 80% of
its money, 90% of its money

459
00:21:46,236 --> 00:21:49,403
on traditional or traditional digital.

460
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:54,107
They're mailing in their
modern, contemporary,

461
00:21:54,107 --> 00:21:57,451
culturally relevant
content in the seven places

462
00:21:57,451 --> 00:21:59,692
that millennials play,
they're mailing it in.

463
00:21:59,692 --> 00:22:03,767
- [Female] This is a
point, yes, but some other

464
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:07,517
economists say that
millennials don't buy it.

465
00:22:08,864 --> 00:22:10,947
(static)

466
00:22:15,122 --> 00:22:17,525
We're thought to think like
her, don't trust anyone.

467
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:21,403
- Meanwhile, millennials
are wearing Adidas,

468
00:22:21,403 --> 00:22:24,050
and Vans and Champion hoodies.

469
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,639
Millennials buy plenty,
they're buying Smart Water.

470
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:28,473
Millennials are fucking people.

471
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,714
I can trick a millennial
to do anything I want.

472
00:22:30,714 --> 00:22:32,653
- [Female] How should other trick them?

473
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:34,696
- By making things that
are valuable to them.

474
00:22:34,696 --> 00:22:35,718
You know how I trick them?

475
00:22:35,718 --> 00:22:37,924
By giving them what they want.

476
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:40,257
By not giving them what I want.

477
00:22:40,257 --> 00:22:43,717
By being consumer-centric,
by listening to millennials.

478
00:22:43,717 --> 00:22:46,051
Millennials will tell you what they want,

479
00:22:46,051 --> 00:22:47,119
you're just not listening.

480
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,442
You know why?

481
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:52,525
Because older generations
have too much audacity.

482
00:22:53,504 --> 00:22:56,441
I can get a millennial to
do anything I want because

483
00:22:56,441 --> 00:23:00,608
I'm deploying humility and
I'm listening, that's why.

484
00:23:01,852 --> 00:23:04,336
- [Female] Social media.

485
00:23:04,336 --> 00:23:06,681
(static)

486
00:23:06,681 --> 00:23:08,598
And you live in the US.

487
00:23:09,781 --> 00:23:11,697
How can you use this fact of two cultures

488
00:23:11,697 --> 00:23:14,704
business-wise, I mean
we are talking about.

489
00:23:14,704 --> 00:23:19,232
- You know if I want to
be a big personal brand in

490
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:23,110
Moscow, I have more autonomy
to do that than I do

491
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,277
in New Delhi or in San Paolo,
so, one, I think anybody's

492
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:30,798
truth is very important.

493
00:23:31,736 --> 00:23:33,953
One of the reasons I think
I do very well in urban

494
00:23:33,953 --> 00:23:37,262
and hip hop worlds is
'cause I liked it as a kid,

495
00:23:37,262 --> 00:23:39,015
'cause I spent a lot of time
with a lot of minorities.

496
00:23:39,015 --> 00:23:42,788
'Cause 90% of the kids in
my college were a minority.

497
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:46,155
So I think that what's
amazing is if you're

498
00:23:46,155 --> 00:23:49,743
willing to embrace your
truth, there's enormous

499
00:23:49,743 --> 00:23:51,670
amount of strength in that.

500
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,667
So for example, there's
a lot of people listening

501
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:55,513
right now with diseases
that they will never

502
00:23:55,513 --> 00:23:59,263
tell anybody, usually mental, right.

503
00:23:59,263 --> 00:24:02,930
I'm very fascinated by
what's happening with

504
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:08,725
meditation, mental
illness, if you're bi-polar

505
00:24:08,725 --> 00:24:11,225
12 years ago you're hiding it.

506
00:24:12,069 --> 00:24:14,844
I think you need to expose it.

507
00:24:14,844 --> 00:24:17,700
And so I think borders are not just

508
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,902
our ancestors and where
we're born, but it's what

509
00:24:21,902 --> 00:24:26,024
makes us, I think there's
so much more that we

510
00:24:26,024 --> 00:24:29,240
should be talking about
and taking control of it.

511
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,793
I, very early on talked
about being a bad student

512
00:24:32,793 --> 00:24:34,673
when it wasn't that popular.

513
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:39,039
I cursed on content in
the early and mid-2000s

514
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,848
when that was not popular.

515
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:45,819
But it was my truth, I
curse, I'm a bad student.

516
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,013
And there's something very
powerful about truths.

517
00:24:48,013 --> 00:24:50,173
So when I think about crossing borders,

518
00:24:50,173 --> 00:24:54,445
if it's your truth you can
be unbelievably successful.

519
00:24:54,445 --> 00:24:57,545
I also think just as very
tactical, I think it's

520
00:24:57,545 --> 00:24:59,310
an incredible time to get
bigger in other places

521
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,342
if you're willing to
transcribe your content.

522
00:25:01,342 --> 00:25:04,093
I'm transcribing my content
into different languages

523
00:25:04,093 --> 00:25:07,611
and watching my popularity
grow in Italy and Asia

524
00:25:07,611 --> 00:25:09,283
and in Spanish speaking countries.

525
00:25:09,283 --> 00:25:10,804
It's very fascinating to see,

526
00:25:10,804 --> 00:25:14,391
Facebook is such an incredible tool.

527
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:17,224
I think of the world as one world.

528
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:21,694
I do think Russia and I think
China have some different

529
00:25:21,694 --> 00:25:23,691
variables because of their structure.

530
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:25,723
China's a big market
itself, it's got its own

531
00:25:25,723 --> 00:25:29,275
insular culture, I think
Russia does the same.

532
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:32,421
But other than that I think
of the world as a one.

533
00:25:32,421 --> 00:25:34,418
- [Female] And Facebook
helps us with that.

534
00:25:34,418 --> 00:25:36,090
- 100%.

535
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,505
- [Female] How much time
does consumer spend time

536
00:25:38,505 --> 00:25:41,152
with Facebook, do you
have a figure on that?

537
00:25:41,152 --> 00:25:43,277
- No, I don't know what
the updated figure is,

538
00:25:43,277 --> 00:25:47,433
but here's what I can
tell you, over 50% of time

539
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:50,257
spent on a mobile device
in the world is being

540
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,552
spent on a social network,
and Facebook has a

541
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,223
disproportionate amount of that time, so,

542
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:57,640
just ungodly hours and hours.

543
00:25:58,486 --> 00:26:02,166
Today, as we record this,
if you add up the attention,

544
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:05,440
time, that is spent in
Facebook and Instagram

545
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,968
combined, it's extraordinary,
the power of that tool.

546
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:12,546
- [Female] How much
power does podcasts have?

547
00:26:12,546 --> 00:26:16,129
- A lot, I think audio
is the next frontier

548
00:26:17,236 --> 00:26:19,082
because it's passive consumption,

549
00:26:19,082 --> 00:26:21,195
and time is very important.

550
00:26:21,195 --> 00:26:24,736
So I'm very bullish on
podcasts, I'm very bullish

551
00:26:24,736 --> 00:26:28,903
on Alexa and Google Home
and devices that interact

552
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:32,375
with you through voice.

553
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:35,185
I'm betting the farm on voice
being the next frontier.

554
00:26:35,185 --> 00:26:37,263
- [Female] Wow.

555
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:38,930
Who's inspiring you?

556
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:44,287
- That's an interesting question.

557
00:26:44,287 --> 00:26:45,370
I'm not sure.

558
00:26:47,178 --> 00:26:50,324
So let me answer this honestly,
that's a good, you know,

559
00:26:50,324 --> 00:26:54,167
I'm inspired by everybody and nobody,

560
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:56,084
if you wanna be honest.

561
00:26:58,161 --> 00:27:01,017
I've never been framed up
as somebody who looked up

562
00:27:01,017 --> 00:27:04,326
or admired people, outside of my parents,

563
00:27:04,326 --> 00:27:08,970
and really even in silos,
my mom as a parenter and

564
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:13,498
as a human being, she gives
advice to everybody too.

565
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,495
Just in a much smaller circle than I did,

566
00:27:15,495 --> 00:27:18,722
so I grew up watching that,
to your earlier question.

567
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:20,754
And my mom's very much my hero.

568
00:27:20,754 --> 00:27:23,854
My dad from the work ethic,
you know the hustle thing

569
00:27:23,854 --> 00:27:27,187
that I talk about, but it's interesting.

570
00:27:30,007 --> 00:27:32,167
My wife, for her inability to complain.

571
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:36,370
There's a lot of people,
and then just silly

572
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,760
stuff, let's use Babin, he's in the room.

573
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,163
Watching Tyler work for me for a year,

574
00:27:42,163 --> 00:27:44,729
knowing from day one he
came to work for a year,

575
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:47,585
use my name, and then go
out and do his own thing.

576
00:27:47,585 --> 00:27:49,335
I knew it, I knew it.

577
00:27:50,197 --> 00:27:52,566
And then to watch him
be able to recognize the

578
00:27:52,566 --> 00:27:55,387
situation and realize it was
valuable for him to stay.

579
00:27:55,387 --> 00:27:57,059
I'm inspired by that.

580
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:59,264
Now maybe that's me,
humble bragging and being

581
00:27:59,264 --> 00:28:02,411
look how good I am, that's fine.

582
00:28:02,411 --> 00:28:05,847
The millions of emails,
DMs and messages I get.

583
00:28:05,847 --> 00:28:09,435
I mean listen, I get an
email and a DM on Instagram

584
00:28:09,435 --> 00:28:13,352
everyday that is from
somebody that's homeless,

585
00:28:14,578 --> 00:28:17,771
10 times a day, 20 times
a day from a single

586
00:28:17,771 --> 00:28:21,254
mother in a really shitty situation,

587
00:28:21,254 --> 00:28:24,528
30 times a day, 30 times
a day from somebody in

588
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:26,896
a mental negative state.

589
00:28:26,896 --> 00:28:27,790
- [Female] Do you answer all?

590
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,694
- No, I wish, fuck man.

591
00:28:29,694 --> 00:28:31,447
- [Female] But doesn't it
frustrate you to have so

592
00:28:31,447 --> 00:28:33,816
many cries for help?

593
00:28:33,816 --> 00:28:36,103
- No because I'm practical.

594
00:28:36,103 --> 00:28:39,520
I am driven and inspired to be a good man

595
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:42,721
because I think people
are counting on me to be.

596
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,230
And I like the challenge.

597
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,897
I like the pressure.

598
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:49,002
It's what I'm comfortable with.

599
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:50,169
It's who I am,

600
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:54,516
- [Female] Gary, you should
listen to my podcast.

601
00:28:54,516 --> 00:28:55,766
- Okay, I will.

602
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,638
- [Female] And I'll listen to yours.

603
00:28:58,638 --> 00:28:59,471
Thank you for coming.

604
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,088
- Thanks for having me.

605
00:29:01,088 --> 00:29:04,083
On this episode, this podcast I did,

606
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:05,848
what was the most interesting
insight you hadn't

607
00:29:05,848 --> 00:29:08,265
heard before in this episode?

608
00:29:10,306 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
