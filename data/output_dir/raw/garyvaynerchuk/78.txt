1
00:00:00,261 --> 00:00:05,058
- Vlog, late night, just
jamming and some stuff.

2
00:00:05,058 --> 00:00:06,890
But it's interesting that,

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,385
just show the wine scene real quick, Iris.

4
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:11,504
There you go, you can
come right back to this.

5
00:00:11,504 --> 00:00:13,579
2018, looking to do this format

6
00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:15,087
much more often on my podcast,

7
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:16,775
get three to four
interesting friends together,

8
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:18,509
drink some wine, talk some shit.

9
00:00:18,509 --> 00:00:20,194
This is a throwback to the first episode

10
00:00:20,194 --> 00:00:21,675
in case you missed it.

11
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:23,058
I hope you enjoy it.

12
00:00:23,058 --> 00:00:25,505
The first episode of Brown Paper Bag 2018.

13
00:00:25,505 --> 00:00:28,400
Huge year for brown paper bags.

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,817
(smooth synthetic music)

15
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:36,793
Hey everybody, this is Gary Vaynerchuk

16
00:00:36,793 --> 00:00:38,564
and this is a new...

17
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:40,910
I'm definitely gonna
do this more than once,

18
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,180
but maybe it will only be
a two thing thing ever,

19
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,013
but I doubt it.

20
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:46,678
I think this could become a new standard.

21
00:00:46,678 --> 00:00:48,307
As many of you know who are listening,

22
00:00:48,307 --> 00:00:49,475
I grew up in the wine world,

23
00:00:49,475 --> 00:00:51,371
and I've been trying to figure out

24
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:52,622
ways to spend more time in it.

25
00:00:52,622 --> 00:00:54,870
I miss it in a lot of ways

26
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,777
with all the stuff I've been doing in tech

27
00:00:56,777 --> 00:00:58,506
and entrepreneurship.

28
00:00:58,506 --> 00:01:01,090
And so, as my podcast continues to evolve,

29
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,886
in December we rebranded it

30
00:01:02,886 --> 00:01:05,081
to the GaryVee Audio Experience,

31
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:07,627
which allowed me to do a lot
more things with it, obviously.

32
00:01:07,627 --> 00:01:10,200
There's keynotes, there's original content

33
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,112
that I'm making for it, some rants.

34
00:01:12,112 --> 00:01:15,972
But this one is completely
straight to podcast.

35
00:01:15,972 --> 00:01:18,219
It's something I'm calling Brown Bags.

36
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:19,994
So this is episode one of Brown Bags

37
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:22,450
within the GaryVee Audio Experience.

38
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,270
And this comes from the favorite thing

39
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,275
that ever happened while
I was in the wine world

40
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:28,843
for the first kind of 20
years of my professional life,

41
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:31,438
which is, when you really
get nerdy about wine,

42
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:33,319
you start getting to a place where

43
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,576
you're trying to figure
out how good you are at it.

44
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:38,200
And one of the ways to do
that is to taste wines blind,

45
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,011
meaning, there's blind

46
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:41,418
where you kind of knew what the wines were

47
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:42,727
and you put 'em in a brown paper bag,

48
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,618
or tin foil, which we have here, set up,

49
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:47,126
and then you try to guess
them or analyze them,

50
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:49,107
or there's double blind,
which is my favorite,

51
00:01:49,107 --> 00:01:51,434
which is, you literally don't
know what the wines are,

52
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:53,999
and they're in brown
paper bags, or tin foil.

53
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:56,829
And so, I've invited three
of my friends to join me,

54
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:57,841
and that's gonna be the format.

55
00:01:57,841 --> 00:02:00,246
Between three or four people,

56
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:02,927
each episode, different
buddies from around the world,

57
00:02:02,927 --> 00:02:04,154
from different walks of life,

58
00:02:04,154 --> 00:02:05,770
and I'll introduce these beautiful

59
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,481
and wonderful people in two seconds.

60
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:09,027
And we will literally do the following,

61
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:11,829
the format of this show is,
we're gonna taste the wines,

62
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:14,981
we're gonna try to tell
ourselves whether we like it.

63
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:16,886
Once in a while we'll bring
in a real professional

64
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,573
like Andre here, who I'll
introduce in a minute.

65
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:20,994
Maybe we'll even get a little bit deeper

66
00:02:20,994 --> 00:02:23,839
and really challenge ourselves,
and probably get exposed

67
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:26,946
or sometimes show amazing skills.

68
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:29,000
And then kind of talk
also about current events,

69
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,167
things in the business world,

70
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:32,158
or just the relationship I have

71
00:02:32,158 --> 00:02:33,510
with these wonderful individuals.

72
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,649
So, before anything else,

73
00:02:35,649 --> 00:02:38,045
I would love to get your
feedback on this format

74
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:42,448
so be very aggressive on
Twitter with the feedback.

75
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:45,796
Put feedback brown bags,
#feedbackbrownbags.

76
00:02:45,796 --> 00:02:46,629
I'll search it.

77
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:48,919
That way, I'd love to
see what you guys think.

78
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,130
And so, let's do this,
let's start introducing.

79
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,863
Why don't we start with you, Mary Kate?

80
00:02:53,863 --> 00:02:55,440
- Hi everyone, I'm Mary Kate McGrath.

81
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,983
I'm the Editor in Chief of PureWow,

82
00:02:58,983 --> 00:03:00,692
which is a digital media company.

83
00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:03,198
We write about all things
for women's lifestyle

84
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:06,242
including wine, so I'm very excited

85
00:03:06,242 --> 00:03:08,715
that Gary just handed me a very heavy pour

86
00:03:08,715 --> 00:03:09,962
of something white.

87
00:03:09,962 --> 00:03:11,144
- Yes, that's true.

88
00:03:11,144 --> 00:03:12,191
I'm pouring white wine right now.

89
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,172
- Very heavy-handed.

90
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:17,248
Can we even say that it's before lunch?

91
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:18,639
- Yeah, you can tell them what time it is.

92
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,365
- It's 10 in the morning, so,

93
00:03:20,365 --> 00:03:22,008
this is actually my second glass today.

94
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:26,055
- But Andre, you've drank
much of wine, right?

95
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:26,888
- Yeah, a lot.

96
00:03:26,888 --> 00:03:27,901
- Before 10 a.m.

97
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:29,867
Like a big percentage of the wine

98
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:32,272
that you've consumed in
your life, prior to 10 a.m.

99
00:03:32,272 --> 00:03:33,105
- Absolutely, and it's probably--

100
00:03:33,105 --> 00:03:34,558
- And especially if you
add in the fact that

101
00:03:34,558 --> 00:03:36,703
once it's 12:01, it's the next day,

102
00:03:36,703 --> 00:03:38,463
the majority of the wine
that you would consume--

103
00:03:38,463 --> 00:03:40,263
- That's right, I would
say about 60 or 70 percent

104
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:41,096
of the wine, yeah.
- Yeah, we'll get to you

105
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:41,929
in a minute.
- Absolutely.

106
00:03:41,929 --> 00:03:43,365
- Mary Kate, you also did not mention

107
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:45,848
that I bought PureWow in January

108
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:49,160
and now I am your ultimate
boss, and not Ryan Harwood,

109
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,890
who is not here.
- It's actually Gary's PureWow

110
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,152
- Should we rename it to GaryWow.com?

111
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:54,985
- Yes.

112
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:55,818
- Let's talk about that

113
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:56,651
after this podcast.
- Yes, I love it, I love it.

114
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:58,011
Yeah, it's done, I just did it.

115
00:03:58,011 --> 00:03:59,281
- Good, Erin?

116
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,781
- Hi, I'm Erin Heatherton, and

117
00:04:03,773 --> 00:04:06,489
you may know me from my
work with Victoria's Secret

118
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:08,739
and Sports Illustrated and,

119
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,995
maybe in the future for, you know,

120
00:04:12,995 --> 00:04:14,369
getting drunk on this show this morning.

121
00:04:14,369 --> 00:04:16,211
(laughing)

122
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:18,277
- And so Erin, tell everybody,

123
00:04:18,277 --> 00:04:20,853
I know a lot of people who are listening,

124
00:04:20,853 --> 00:04:21,845
like me, or sports fans.

125
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,037
I'm fascinated by your
true love of sports.

126
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:26,369
Give a little bit of like the content

127
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:27,245
or some of the stuff you've been doing

128
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:29,297
in that world 'cause
I'm intrigued by that.

129
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:30,483
- Yeah, so I was, I mean,

130
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:32,452
my parents are married because of sports.

131
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:34,035
That's all they do.

132
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:37,648
So, yes,

133
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:40,573
sports just played a huge role in my life.

134
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:42,293
I played basketball everyday.

135
00:04:42,293 --> 00:04:44,359
I ran track, and, you know,

136
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:46,817
those experiences shaped who I am,

137
00:04:46,817 --> 00:04:49,050
and they were the most kind of rewarding

138
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,927
and built my confidence,
in the kind of like,

139
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:53,531
I think everything I bring to the table

140
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:55,492
in the modeling world came from

141
00:04:55,492 --> 00:04:57,742
being a competitive athlete

142
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:02,364
and having that mobility and kind of just,

143
00:05:02,364 --> 00:05:03,901
being a model is a lot
like being an athlete

144
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:07,234
'cause you gotta perform with your body.

145
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,975
You gotta play good or you're not playing.

146
00:05:12,975 --> 00:05:16,830
Yeah, that shaped me, and
also, I kind of figured,

147
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,868
at a certain point, for five
years I did high fashion,

148
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:22,192
so I did five years of fashion weeks,

149
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:24,849
so, it's like 10 fashion
weeks, it's a lot.

150
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:26,043
And I've been around all these,

151
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:28,610
you know I was plucked
kind of out of Chicago

152
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,271
and into New York, into this fashion world

153
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:32,173
that I wasn't involved in growing up,

154
00:05:32,173 --> 00:05:34,023
and I got to a certain
point where I'm like,

155
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:35,494
you know, there nothing wrong,

156
00:05:35,494 --> 00:05:38,989
I don't dislike anyone in fashion, but,

157
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:41,679
being at a party with a bunch
of people that love fashion,

158
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:42,512
I'm not really that,

159
00:05:42,512 --> 00:05:45,031
I realized I'm just not that into fashion.

160
00:05:45,031 --> 00:05:47,096
I would rather spend my
time being around people

161
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,342
who enjoy sports because
I understand those people.

162
00:05:49,342 --> 00:05:52,438
Those people are, those are my people.

163
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:55,826
And so I kind of took, I realized that,

164
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:57,794
I'm like, I'm gonna take myself

165
00:05:57,794 --> 00:06:00,466
from this corner of, I always
thought of it like kind of,

166
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:02,223
there's four frozen yogurt
stands in one corner,

167
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:03,831
and they're all just where,

168
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:06,056
like I'm just gonna take
myself and go somewhere else

169
00:06:06,056 --> 00:06:09,152
and see what I can achieve
and I can be around people

170
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:12,179
that are people that I can
feel more comfortable around,

171
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:13,012
you know what I'm saying?

172
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:13,876
- And that's what sports did for you?

173
00:06:13,876 --> 00:06:14,771
- And that's what sports did for me.

174
00:06:14,771 --> 00:06:17,473
So I started working with the Northwest,

175
00:06:17,473 --> 00:06:19,988
and that was a great, he never
worked with a model before,

176
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:22,200
and I was their
spokes-model for two years,

177
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,450
and most likely continuing.

178
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,989
Got to do amazing things,
like throw opening pitches

179
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,429
the Cubs and Mets games, and, you know,

180
00:06:31,429 --> 00:06:35,289
just travel around, go to the
Superbowl, talk to people.

181
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:40,140
People that are involved in the
sports world are incredible.

182
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,822
I think that there's just this true,

183
00:06:42,822 --> 00:06:44,956
I mean, I don't wanna, I'm
going on a sports rant.

184
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:45,817
Excuse me.

185
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:46,734
- That's 'cause I set you up for that.

186
00:06:46,734 --> 00:06:47,802
- Oh, it's okay to go on? (laughs)

187
00:06:47,802 --> 00:06:48,724
- Well, let me cut you off, 'cause,

188
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:50,079
my fans know I love to do that.

189
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,228
How devastated are you that Jimmy Butler

190
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:54,724
is now in Minnesota, not in Chicago?

191
00:06:54,724 --> 00:06:57,499
- [Erin] Dude, Jimmy Butler is my boy.

192
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:58,633
- [Gary] You're crushed.

193
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:02,446
- Yes, I'm so crushed,
I hit him up on Twitter

194
00:07:02,446 --> 00:07:05,303
and I produced this horse game with him,

195
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:07,780
through Sports Illustrated, and he is,

196
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,266
I just was wat, like, that, that season,

197
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:12,563
like, he captivated me,

198
00:07:12,563 --> 00:07:15,126
and I was just, like, I mean,

199
00:07:15,126 --> 00:07:16,684
since Michael Jordan

200
00:07:16,684 --> 00:07:18,019
I never really had some--
- Let's be very careful

201
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:19,178
with throwing that name around here.

202
00:07:19,178 --> 00:07:20,507
I hate him with all my heart.

203
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:21,699
- You don't like Jimmy?

204
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:23,678
- [Gary] No, no, Jimmy's fine-ish,

205
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:25,059
but I hate Michael Jordan.

206
00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:25,892
- (gasping) Really?

207
00:07:25,892 --> 00:07:27,271
Oh my god, please tell
me, I love divisive--

208
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:29,967
- Well, I'm a Knicks fan,
and I hate Michael Jordan.

209
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:32,046
That's a perfect segue, Andre?

210
00:07:32,046 --> 00:07:33,258
- Yeah?
- Damn.

211
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:37,947
- Yo, yo, this is Andre
Mack, a.k.a. Mouton Noir.

212
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:40,311
I make wine from the Pacific Northwest,

213
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:42,132
and I'm excited to be here today.

214
00:07:42,132 --> 00:07:43,788
- So, Andre, hold on, I mean, listen,

215
00:07:43,788 --> 00:07:44,689
let's get a little bit deep here.

216
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:46,618
You're the real wine guy here.

217
00:07:46,618 --> 00:07:49,884
I played wine once in a while, but, like,

218
00:07:49,884 --> 00:07:51,800
why don't you give us a two-minute story

219
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,479
of, like, your rise to fame, because,

220
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,396
we met a long time ago.

221
00:07:57,403 --> 00:08:00,066
When I thought of this concept,

222
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:01,603
your name bubbled to the tippy top.

223
00:08:01,603 --> 00:08:04,108
I mean, I interacted with hundreds

224
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,178
of thousands of wine people,
but, you were at number one

225
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:08,176
on the list of who I wanted
- We got history,

226
00:08:08,176 --> 00:08:09,766
we got history, no totally.
- To be here today

227
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:11,126
so, tell everybody--

228
00:08:11,126 --> 00:08:12,418
- So my background is restaurants.

229
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:15,403
I worked as a sommelier for many years.

230
00:08:15,403 --> 00:08:17,360
- Hold on, real quick, Andre,
I'm sorry, we're excited.

231
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,077
But we've got the first wine poured.

232
00:08:19,077 --> 00:08:20,332
These are all blind wines.

233
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:22,454
The first one is a white
wine, we've established that.

234
00:08:22,454 --> 00:08:24,551
We're gonna let Andre tell his thing,

235
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:27,160
but, like, I could see that Erin was ready

236
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,716
to like, drink it right now.
- She's been behaving herself.

237
00:08:29,716 --> 00:08:31,569
- You guys can smell it,
but do not drink yet.

238
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:33,613
We're gonna get into the sniffy
sniff and the first taste

239
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:34,541
in a minute.
- No tasting yet.

240
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,381
- But, we need Andre to be
able to do his thing, go ahead.

241
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,318
- No, no, so I started in restaurants.

242
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,956
My background was in
restaurants as a sommelier,

243
00:08:40,957 --> 00:08:41,789
for many years.

244
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,776
I started in Texas, of all places,

245
00:08:43,777 --> 00:08:47,774
and made my way to the
French Laundry in California,

246
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:49,964
worked for Chef Thomas Keller,

247
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:53,629
and then I moved to New York
unsight, unseen, in 2004,

248
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:56,376
to be the opening sommelier for

249
00:08:56,376 --> 00:08:59,281
the sister restaurant, per se.

250
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:00,859
And that's where I met Gary.

251
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:04,940
Gary came in with a group
of purveyors and a friend,

252
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,730
and I was like, who the fuck is this guy?

253
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,966
Like, he just kept
chirping and I was like,

254
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,285
I like this guy, like, I
had never heard of him,

255
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,699
and then, like, I think
he went to the bathroom

256
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:15,267
and John leaned in and goes, "No, dude,

257
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:17,304
"this dude sells the most
fucking wine on the Internet."

258
00:09:17,304 --> 00:09:18,338
I was like, that guy?

259
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:20,432
He's like, "That dude."

260
00:09:20,432 --> 00:09:22,932
And we quickly became friends.

261
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:26,167
But anyways, that's kind of my rise.

262
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:28,090
I've been in New York ever since.

263
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,614
I left the restaurant business in 2007,

264
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:33,503
wanting to continue my
education about wine

265
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:37,234
and I felt the only way to
do that was to make my own.

266
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:39,418
So we make about 40,000 cases now, and--

267
00:09:39,418 --> 00:09:41,029
- Are you up to 40,000 cases, man?

268
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:41,862
That's amazing.

269
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:44,029
- 47 states, 22 countries.

270
00:09:45,263 --> 00:09:46,915
- [Gary] How many
different SKUs do you use?

271
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:48,618
- We have about like 13 different SKUs,

272
00:09:48,618 --> 00:09:50,711
but we're SKU-heavy for those.

273
00:09:50,711 --> 00:09:53,345
Our most popular wine is
called Other People's Pinot.

274
00:09:53,345 --> 00:09:54,204
I'm sure you've seen it.

275
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:57,636
It's got a big ole white
and black OPP on the front.

276
00:09:57,636 --> 00:10:01,944
- You throw a lot of
hip-hop into your wine names

277
00:10:01,944 --> 00:10:03,522
and things of that nature, right?

278
00:10:03,522 --> 00:10:04,918
- Yeah, absolutely, I mean, you know,

279
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:07,457
I'm just a kid who, I grew up on hip-hop,

280
00:10:07,457 --> 00:10:09,906
and I just happened to
fall in love with wine,

281
00:10:09,906 --> 00:10:10,739
and I just kept thinking,

282
00:10:10,739 --> 00:10:12,921
why not be able to put
those two things together?

283
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:15,384
It felt like every person I talked to

284
00:10:15,384 --> 00:10:16,636
who was in the wine business,

285
00:10:16,636 --> 00:10:18,682
always got the hip-hop references,

286
00:10:18,682 --> 00:10:20,359
we're always singing those songs.

287
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:22,276
- [Erin] I'd love that.

288
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,147
- As a Texas boy, I feel
like Scarface hasn't entered

289
00:10:27,147 --> 00:10:29,370
any of your labels just yet.

290
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,902
Don't you think that's
a little disrespectful?

291
00:10:30,902 --> 00:10:34,285
And can we please address that
with one of your next cuvees?

292
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:36,796
- Maybe we'll do it subtly, but,

293
00:10:36,796 --> 00:10:38,311
they were raw, they were raw.

294
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:40,981
The ghetto boys in Scarface,
they were really raw.

295
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:42,498
I don't know if they're
really ready for that.

296
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:45,224
I think I, tentatively I
had a wine called Ill Na Na,

297
00:10:45,224 --> 00:10:47,943
and some others, that hit
the kibosh on that one, so.

298
00:10:47,943 --> 00:10:49,404
- What, the alcohol and tobacco world

299
00:10:49,404 --> 00:10:50,237
wouldn't let you do that?

300
00:10:50,237 --> 00:10:52,723
- No, no, no, I think it was
more my wife was like, dude.

301
00:10:52,723 --> 00:10:54,461
- You're pushing it too far?

302
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:55,913
- I think I know what that is, like--

303
00:10:55,913 --> 00:10:57,127
- [Gary] Like, cut that shit.
- Yeah, totally.

304
00:10:57,127 --> 00:10:59,922
- All right, we've
established the four of us.

305
00:10:59,922 --> 00:11:01,313
Let's go into the first wine.

306
00:11:01,313 --> 00:11:03,862
Andre, I'm gonna let you take it away.

307
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:06,293
What should everybody
be doing at this point?

308
00:11:06,293 --> 00:11:09,347
- Oh wow, you should be
actually looking at the color.

309
00:11:09,347 --> 00:11:11,716
Color can tell you a
lot of different things,

310
00:11:11,716 --> 00:11:12,827
but we have a brown background,

311
00:11:12,827 --> 00:11:14,612
so maybe you wanna hold it over the rug

312
00:11:14,612 --> 00:11:15,720
or maybe a white background.

313
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,397
You just wanna kinda look at the wine.

314
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:20,347
I mean, we get points for
naming the color of the wine,

315
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,566
so, it's white, right? (laughs)

316
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:24,389
We know that, we got that right,

317
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:26,154
take all credit--
- You are crushing it, Andre.

318
00:11:26,154 --> 00:11:26,987
- What do they say?

319
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,401
Hey, you get five points
for writing your name

320
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:29,309
on the paper, right?
- [Woman] He's the expert?

321
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:30,859
- It's true, it's true, so look,

322
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:32,339
let's establish some rules here.

323
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,417
We don't need to guess what
this is, or what you have.

324
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:37,360
Where I want to take
it for all four of us,

325
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,229
even for us, like, we don't have to guess

326
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:41,247
what regions it's from, what vintage.

327
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:43,522
At this point, Andre, it
must be fun for you as well.

328
00:11:43,522 --> 00:11:45,752
Like, we grew up in the wine
world when it wasn't cultural.

329
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:48,281
Now, because of Netflix and
all these documentaries,

330
00:11:48,281 --> 00:11:50,840
everybody, it feels, has seen Somm

331
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,884
or this, that, or the other thing, so,

332
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:56,244
even though Andre very
much has those capabilities

333
00:11:56,244 --> 00:11:58,198
and I'm sure guests that
I have on Brown Bags

334
00:11:58,198 --> 00:11:59,345
will have those capabilities,

335
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:01,490
that is not really where
I'm looking to take it.

336
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,217
Where I'm looking to take it is,

337
00:12:03,217 --> 00:12:05,768
do you like it, what does it taste like,

338
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:09,185
and maybe, how much do you
think it costs, would be cool.

339
00:12:09,185 --> 00:12:10,690
Can you do me a favor, Trouty,

340
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,610
I know you're in the background.

341
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,663
I don't know what the wines are either.

342
00:12:12,663 --> 00:12:14,259
I know Brandon picked
them from Wine Library.

343
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:17,041
Can you get him to text
you what the wines are,

344
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:21,655
and maybe the current mainstream
scores and the price point?

345
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:23,292
Just so when we have the unveil,

346
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:25,484
because I'm totally not prepared for this.

347
00:12:25,484 --> 00:12:26,534
- [Erin] Can we guess, like--

348
00:12:26,534 --> 00:12:27,846
- You can guess anything you want.

349
00:12:27,846 --> 00:12:29,920
- [Erin] I would like to know,
like, without telling us,

350
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,763
I wanna know if we know.

351
00:12:31,763 --> 00:12:33,319
- Yeah, of course.
- If it's like, a Syrah

352
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,152
or a Pinot or--

353
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:35,491
- [Gary] Yeah, I promise
you it's not any of those,

354
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:36,599
since those are red wines.

355
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:38,817
- I didn't wanna say
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding,

356
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:39,650
I'm kidding.
- whites because,

357
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,363
no, I, because, you know,
anchoring, you know.

358
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:42,362
- Yes, no, no, don't worry.

359
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,018
So, let's sniffy sniff first.

360
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:45,497
For anybody who watched Wine Library TV,

361
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:48,004
I call it sniffy sniff because
I wanted it to be funny,

362
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:51,741
and wanted to be memorable,
but what I really wanted was,

363
00:12:51,741 --> 00:12:53,379
you know, Wine Library
TV, it'll be interesting.

364
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:55,851
I'll actually ask you your
perspective on Wine Library TV.

365
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:59,700
It was so important to me
to trick America at scale

366
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,510
into a couple things
that I thought mattered,

367
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,396
which was, one, trust your own palate.

368
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:05,536
Forget about what Andre and I say, like,

369
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,406
we don't get nervous
about our point of view

370
00:13:07,406 --> 00:13:10,714
on sushi, or a
cheeseburger, but with wine,

371
00:13:10,714 --> 00:13:12,896
we're always looking at the
person that knows the most,

372
00:13:12,896 --> 00:13:15,437
and we have to succumb to
his or her point of view.

373
00:13:15,437 --> 00:13:16,495
I hated that.

374
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,857
I'd like to change that,
that was a big goal of mine.

375
00:13:18,857 --> 00:13:21,201
And number two, we need
to smell wine more.

376
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,581
Like, you guys cannot
imagine how much more

377
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:25,898
you will enjoy the wine if you smell it.

378
00:13:25,898 --> 00:13:27,427
So let's get the sniffy sniff.

379
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:28,933
Now, Mary Kate, I don't
want you to be polite

380
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,182
or PureWow while we're here.

381
00:13:30,182 --> 00:13:32,963
I want your schnoz, there
you go, all the way in, yeah.

382
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:34,144
- That's how you do it?
- It's like, dripping

383
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:35,194
in white wine now.
- Yeah, yes.

384
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:36,377
- Are you supposed to wait, Gary,

385
00:13:36,377 --> 00:13:38,015
and let it kind of open
up and keep going back

386
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:39,578
and smelling it again and again?

387
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:40,924
- Well, I like swirling the wine,

388
00:13:40,924 --> 00:13:41,874
bringing it up.
- My nose is wet.

389
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:43,058
- Yeah, yeah, I learned this.

390
00:13:43,058 --> 00:13:44,956
- So yeah, you wanna aerate the wine,

391
00:13:44,956 --> 00:13:45,889
and what Gary's talking about,

392
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:47,832
most people don't smell the wine.

393
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:49,799
90% of taste is smell, right?

394
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,003
Think about, like, when you were a kid

395
00:13:51,003 --> 00:13:52,821
and you pinched your
nose 'cause something,

396
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:53,856
you didn't want to eat your asparagus

397
00:13:53,856 --> 00:13:55,265
or whatever it was, right?

398
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:56,098
Kind of the same thing.

399
00:13:56,098 --> 00:13:58,027
So you want to actually
slightly crack your mouth.

400
00:13:58,027 --> 00:13:59,595
I'm gettin' a little nerdy
here, Gary, I'm sorry.

401
00:13:59,595 --> 00:14:00,428
- [Gary] I'm listening.

402
00:14:00,428 --> 00:14:01,520
- You wanna crack your mouth a little bit,

403
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,698
and you wanna inhale through your nose

404
00:14:02,698 --> 00:14:04,608
and exhale through your mouth, right?

405
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:06,173
And that opens up the olfactory senses,

406
00:14:06,173 --> 00:14:10,340
so you get, like, this
better sense of smell, yeah.

407
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:13,844
So you want, yeah, you wanna smell.

408
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:15,182
- [Erin] What you just
said, I've never smelled

409
00:14:15,182 --> 00:14:16,453
like that before, in my life.

410
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:17,728
- Yeah.

411
00:14:17,728 --> 00:14:20,470
- [Erin] That just blew my mind.

412
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,460
- All right, so what do you
- Are they like tasting?

413
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,596
I'm like spillin' over here.
- guys, what are you guys,

414
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:23,429
what'd you get, don't worry.
- Are we tasting

415
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,408
or not tasting?
- What're you guys getting

416
00:14:24,408 --> 00:14:25,241
on the nose?

417
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:28,232
Like what are we tasting here?

418
00:14:28,232 --> 00:14:29,627
(sloshing)

419
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:31,358
- Are you smelling, are
you hearing me smell?

420
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:32,663
- Yes, it's making up

421
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,129
your smell.
- Oh I thought we were.

422
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:36,884
- Erin, I know you're
drunk, and that's fine too.

423
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:37,717
(Erin laughing)

424
00:14:37,717 --> 00:14:39,300
I mean, on the nose thing, like,

425
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,582
for me, the melon and honeydew thing

426
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:42,702
is coming through on the nose,

427
00:14:42,702 --> 00:14:43,925
which I like.
- I get a little bit of that.

428
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:44,894
- What are you getting Andre?
- I get a little bit of

429
00:14:44,894 --> 00:14:46,404
canned asparagus, like slightly,

430
00:14:46,404 --> 00:14:47,250
like when you first open it up.

431
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,357
Not that that's a bad thing
or a good thing, but--

432
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:50,408
- You buy canned asparagus?
- This is what I love.

433
00:14:50,408 --> 00:14:51,274
This is what, exactly.

434
00:14:51,274 --> 00:14:54,745
This is what always
cracks me about tastings.

435
00:14:54,745 --> 00:14:56,000
- I know, I--
- No, my mom used to buy it.

436
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,489
- Yeah, I get it, I get it.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

437
00:14:57,489 --> 00:14:58,359
But my mom used to buy

438
00:14:58,359 --> 00:14:59,326
canned asparagus.
- Now I assume you go

439
00:14:59,326 --> 00:15:01,549
to a good, solid, like, you know,

440
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:04,488
fresh food farm in Brooklyn.
- Oh you know, feed me

441
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:05,321
(mumbles), oh totally, yeah.
- So Gary, I don't know

442
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,147
if you know this, my
first job out of college,

443
00:15:08,147 --> 00:15:12,357
I was a whiskey editor, and
I was a 22-year-old girl

444
00:15:12,357 --> 00:15:14,922
who had never drank
whiskey before in her life.

445
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:16,267
And I'd go to these tastings--
- And you got the job

446
00:15:16,267 --> 00:15:17,285
as the whiskey ed--
- And I got the job.

447
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:18,510
- Sounds like a real
fucking fine establishment.

448
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,135
(laughter)

449
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:21,684
- [Mary Kate] The
magazine has since folded.

450
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:24,036
- No shit, go ahead.

451
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:27,688
- So, no, I edited a very
smart whiskey person,

452
00:15:27,688 --> 00:15:29,278
but I would have to go on tastings,

453
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:31,216
and, Andre, this is when I always wanted

454
00:15:31,216 --> 00:15:32,951
to call bullshit on people,
because they'd be like,

455
00:15:32,951 --> 00:15:36,368
"Ah, I smell the pita of the isle of yore

456
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:41,395
"in Scotland in 1901."

457
00:15:41,395 --> 00:15:44,030
I'd be like, what, I smell alcohol.

458
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,972
- Correct and that's exactly--
- Well that's 'cause

459
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:45,805
you didn't know shit.

460
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:47,445
- And that's what I
smelled at the beginning.

461
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:48,805
Like, when I first started,
- Yeah, me too.

462
00:15:48,805 --> 00:15:49,638
- it was like--
- Wine.

463
00:15:49,638 --> 00:15:50,471
- all I smell is alcohol, like,

464
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:52,883
I mean, how can you get any
of those things out of that?

465
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:53,798
- [Mary Kate] But, canned asparagus,

466
00:15:53,798 --> 00:15:56,735
this really hearkens you back
to a canned asparagus moment?

467
00:15:56,735 --> 00:15:58,827
- But these are all moments, right?

468
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:00,662
When you smell things, it's
supposed to take you back

469
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:02,738
and when I tell people,
when you smell wine,

470
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:04,712
talk about what it makes you think about.

471
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:06,244
Like, he was famous for saying,

472
00:16:06,244 --> 00:16:07,558
"This is like Big League Chew."

473
00:16:07,558 --> 00:16:08,949
Well, you know--
- 'Cause it was.

474
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:09,924
- obviously it didn't taste like that,

475
00:16:09,924 --> 00:16:11,275
but, like, that's what it reminded him of.

476
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:12,505
When you opened up that pouch,

477
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:13,902
when you and your boys got into the store

478
00:16:13,902 --> 00:16:14,927
and you opened that pouch--
- That saccharin smell.

479
00:16:14,927 --> 00:16:16,866
- yeah, it's about memories,
like, someone's like,

480
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:18,351
"Hey, this wine reminds
me of my grandfather,"

481
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:20,199
and you're like, "So, what
about your grandfather?"

482
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:21,411
"Yeah, I used to sit on his lap

483
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:23,589
"and he would smoke a cigar," ah, right?

484
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:26,248
It's the cedar, you're smelling
the oak on the wine, right?

485
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:28,296
So, I think it's just more about memories.

486
00:16:28,296 --> 00:16:29,220
It's like when you

487
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,228
smell something--
- Mary Kate, I would

488
00:16:30,228 --> 00:16:32,295
add on that, like, to Andre's point, like,

489
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:33,765
what really broke me out, I thought,

490
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:36,397
with Wine Library TV, is that
I really just talked about,

491
00:16:36,397 --> 00:16:38,477
I remember being scared,

492
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:40,759
to being called out in a blind tasting.

493
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,379
I was in the wine world.

494
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:44,145
It wasn't like I was
trying to be a comedian

495
00:16:44,145 --> 00:16:47,141
or doing a shtick, so,
I remember being fearful

496
00:16:47,141 --> 00:16:49,247
of people giving me a
glass of wine and saying,

497
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:50,858
what do you smell, or what do you think?

498
00:16:50,858 --> 00:16:53,493
And so, I was like, look,
I need to go as true,

499
00:16:53,493 --> 00:16:54,587
for everybody who's listening,

500
00:16:54,587 --> 00:16:57,265
in the same way I kind of
call it like I see it stuff,

501
00:16:57,265 --> 00:17:00,722
I did that for wine, in
that I used Big League Chew,

502
00:17:00,722 --> 00:17:04,190
or the way a racketball smelled
to me, or anything else,

503
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:08,247
because I knew that if I smelt
it again, I could recall it.

504
00:17:08,247 --> 00:17:11,088
And so, the nuances are there,

505
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:14,578
as they are in coffee and
tea and other alcohols,

506
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:17,795
brown goods, the flavors are there.

507
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:21,119
I think to Andre's point,
and to your point, actually,

508
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,231
I apologize, there was a lot of adjectives

509
00:17:24,232 --> 00:17:26,689
and descriptors that were
established by the wine world,

510
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:28,865
that everybody kept rinsing and repeating,

511
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:31,789
and I feel like we
forced our ways into it.

512
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:35,394
Whereas, now, I think,
with the democratization

513
00:17:35,394 --> 00:17:37,877
of Instagram and
personalities and bloggers

514
00:17:37,877 --> 00:17:39,911
and what I started with Wine Library TV,

515
00:17:39,911 --> 00:17:42,088
now that there aren't four or five people

516
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:44,078
that control everything anymore,

517
00:17:44,078 --> 00:17:46,543
there's been more freedom
in the descriptors,

518
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:47,376
and I think that's powerful.
- Absolutely, I mean,

519
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:49,000
people describe wines as banging, right?

520
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,263
You're like, that one is banging.

521
00:17:50,263 --> 00:17:51,323
You're like, oh, wow, okay.

522
00:17:51,323 --> 00:17:52,958
- That makes sense--
- Yeah, see.

523
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:53,994
- [Mary Kate] Yeah, it does, yeah.

524
00:17:53,994 --> 00:17:57,336
And also just the democratization
of the entry of wine too,

525
00:17:57,336 --> 00:18:00,198
the fact that you have
an OPP, I mean, like,

526
00:18:00,198 --> 00:18:03,042
that didn't exist 15 years ago.

527
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:04,800
- All right, enough
bullshitting, let's drink this.

528
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,293
- All right.

529
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,754
(slurping and swishing)

530
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,719
- [Erin] How do you drink it, Andre?

531
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:12,913
I love technical stuff like this.

532
00:18:12,913 --> 00:18:13,820
- [Gary] Carefully.

533
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,942
- Yeah, very carefully,
is that what he said?

534
00:18:15,942 --> 00:18:17,290
Yeah, you just want to, you know, sip it,

535
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,105
maybe pull in some air into your mouth.

536
00:18:19,105 --> 00:18:22,116
If you wanna gargle it, you can gargle it.

537
00:18:22,116 --> 00:18:24,266
All those things make a difference, like,

538
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:25,963
some people swish it
around in their mouth,

539
00:18:25,963 --> 00:18:28,158
push it through the front
part of their teeth, you know,

540
00:18:28,158 --> 00:18:29,585
all those different things can tell people

541
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:30,418
something different about the wine.

542
00:18:30,418 --> 00:18:31,995
- It's really, really, really great,

543
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:33,357
Erin, to like, make sure it hits

544
00:18:33,357 --> 00:18:36,134
as much of your tongue as possible.

545
00:18:36,134 --> 00:18:38,335
So, like, that is something
that you should really,

546
00:18:38,335 --> 00:18:39,348
yeah, you like that part?

547
00:18:39,348 --> 00:18:40,181
- [Mary Kate] Zingy!

548
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:41,899
- You know, like, like--

549
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:42,832
- [Erin] I smelled fruit.

550
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:45,031
I smelled differently today,
I tasted differently today.

551
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:46,632
- Right, because what happens,

552
00:18:46,632 --> 00:18:48,130
the reason you probably said zingy is,

553
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,585
you probably got more
wine into the back part

554
00:18:50,585 --> 00:18:52,701
of your tongue, which
is gonna kick that in,

555
00:18:52,701 --> 00:18:53,946
and most people never get there.

556
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:56,245
- [Erin] Oh wow, yeah, my
face, I just like, wow.

557
00:18:56,245 --> 00:18:57,078
- [Mary Kate] Yeah, wine drinking

558
00:18:57,078 --> 00:18:57,985
is not a pretty sport.
- What'd you get flush?

559
00:18:57,985 --> 00:18:59,593
- [Erin] No, it just
was a powerful feeling.

560
00:18:59,593 --> 00:19:01,602
It was really, it was rad, it was...

561
00:19:01,602 --> 00:19:03,735
(Mary Kate laughing)

562
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:06,479
- So, to me, the one thing that,

563
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:11,035
for everybody who's listening,
that I highly recommend,

564
00:19:11,035 --> 00:19:12,306
is tasting wine in two ways.

565
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:14,795
One, if you're like
listening along right now,

566
00:19:14,795 --> 00:19:16,103
just taste your wine, just drink it

567
00:19:16,103 --> 00:19:17,257
in the way you normally do.

568
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:20,569
And then two, swish it around,
let it hit different parts.

569
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:23,498
You will be stunned by
how different it tastes.

570
00:19:23,498 --> 00:19:26,672
What will be ironic is, for most people,

571
00:19:26,672 --> 00:19:29,565
the second way usually
will not be as pleasing

572
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:32,531
because the acidity and the tannins,

573
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:34,258
depending on a red or white wine,

574
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:37,595
will be more accentuated when
it hits more of your mouth

575
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:40,588
and you won't like that
bitterness or acid as much,

576
00:19:40,588 --> 00:19:44,036
and it'll become, for a lot
of people, less flavorful.

577
00:19:44,036 --> 00:19:45,243
- [Erin] I found that with this though,

578
00:19:45,243 --> 00:19:47,383
like, that feeling balanced it.

579
00:19:47,383 --> 00:19:49,466
Like, that, you know, I--

580
00:19:51,197 --> 00:19:52,116
- You liked it, or you--

581
00:19:52,116 --> 00:19:53,097
- This is great.

582
00:19:53,097 --> 00:19:53,930
I love this.

583
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,271
- [Gary] Nobody say what they think.

584
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:57,058
- Oh my god, I'm just jumping the gun.

585
00:19:57,058 --> 00:19:58,000
- We're gonna need you to leave.

586
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,684
Thanks for coming, Erin,
it's great to catch up.

587
00:19:59,684 --> 00:20:00,606
(laughter)

588
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:01,878
- Someone's moving on, oh my god,

589
00:20:01,878 --> 00:20:03,459
that's so embarrassing.
- So let's pour this out,

590
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:05,042
we're gonna move on in a minute.

591
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:08,031
Like, gather your thoughts on this wine.

592
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:09,014
Think about it.
- We need cheat sheets

593
00:20:09,014 --> 00:20:10,207
or something to write our notes down.

594
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:11,662
- Yeah, I mean, there's only five wines.

595
00:20:11,662 --> 00:20:14,037
- Okay I guess I can remember.
- But if your memory's not

596
00:20:14,037 --> 00:20:17,139
basic, you're more than
welcome to take out your phone.

597
00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:18,335
I'm gonna pour the second wine.

598
00:20:18,335 --> 00:20:21,276
Andre, what's been going
on in the wine world?

599
00:20:21,276 --> 00:20:24,358
Like, what's the real kind of,

600
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:26,900
what's a trend or two
that, for somebody like me

601
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,575
that's not in it day
in and day out anymore,

602
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:31,378
has emerged in the last couple years?

603
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:34,517
- Got it, uh, lots more
sparkling wine from America.

604
00:20:34,517 --> 00:20:35,350
- Really?

605
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,767
- Yeah, so you're startin'
to see a lot more of that.

606
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:39,352
Definitely made in like different fashions

607
00:20:39,352 --> 00:20:41,791
like Methode Champenoise,
but you also have stuff

608
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,723
that's happening Pattonette style,

609
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:45,858
so you have a lot of that
kind of stuff going on.

610
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:49,820
Loire Valley varietals are
pretty hot here domestically.

611
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,029
- [Erin] Loire Valley's my favorite.

612
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:52,212
- Yeah, so you enjoy those?
- That's what I always,

613
00:20:52,212 --> 00:20:53,414
yeah, that's what I look for.

614
00:20:53,414 --> 00:20:55,278
- Wait a minute, so you mean Sancerre?

615
00:20:55,278 --> 00:20:57,663
- [Erin] Just Loire Valley,
but like, Sancerre, yeah.

616
00:20:57,663 --> 00:20:59,313
A Chablis is--

617
00:20:59,313 --> 00:21:00,601
- That's burgundy.

618
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:01,434
- [Erin] Is it?

619
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:02,267
Chablis, well, Gamay--

620
00:21:02,267 --> 00:21:04,553
- Erin, we're gonna need you to, leave.

621
00:21:04,553 --> 00:21:05,855
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
- You know what--

622
00:21:05,855 --> 00:21:06,688
(all laughing)

623
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:08,040
- We're gonna need ya--
- Thanks for playing.

624
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,894
- It's all good.
- It's been really great.

625
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:09,951
- I'll just slowly

626
00:21:09,951 --> 00:21:10,784
crab walk to the door.
- That's three strikes,

627
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:11,746
Michael Jordan number one.

628
00:21:11,746 --> 00:21:14,209
(All laughing)

629
00:21:14,209 --> 00:21:17,231
- Absolutely, Rose is something that's--

630
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:18,064
- That's insane.
that's white hot right now.

631
00:21:18,064 --> 00:21:18,897
- [Mary Kay] It's insane!

632
00:21:18,897 --> 00:21:19,907
- [Gary] That's insane.

633
00:21:19,907 --> 00:21:21,341
Ten years ago, I couldn't sell Rose--

634
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:22,214
- Absolutely.

635
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,297
- if, like, it came with free money.

636
00:21:24,297 --> 00:21:26,632
Now, it's like, literally culture.

637
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:28,499
- Yeah, well, and it's just interesting

638
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:29,813
to be on that beat, you know.

639
00:21:29,813 --> 00:21:31,515
We started making Rose in 2009

640
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:34,185
and taking it out to
places across the country.

641
00:21:34,185 --> 00:21:35,909
People are like, yeah, whatever.

642
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:38,037
Like Las Vegas, like,
it's hot as shit there,

643
00:21:38,037 --> 00:21:39,735
and people are like, nope,

644
00:21:39,735 --> 00:21:41,248
because people didn't want to be confused

645
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,607
with drinking white zinfandel.

646
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:45,700
- That's right, that was a
halo that sat over it forever.

647
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,565
- What's wrong with that, white zinfandel?

648
00:21:47,565 --> 00:21:50,037
- It was two dollars and it
was sweet, and it was garbage,

649
00:21:50,037 --> 00:21:51,708
and old grandmothers drank it,

650
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,648
and nobody wanted to
be associated with it.

651
00:21:53,648 --> 00:21:54,608
- [Mary Kate] It came in like, jugs.

652
00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:57,295
- Yep, and, so now it's
changed, you know, like,

653
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:58,428
I'm in Minnesota and someone's like,

654
00:21:58,428 --> 00:21:59,261
"Hey, I'm gonna take you to this shop

655
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:02,919
"that has the most Rosé," and
you walk in, and last year

656
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:04,571
they had, like, a table
with five of 'em on it.

657
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:06,351
Now they have two tables full, right?

658
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:09,521
So it's definitely a genre that's grown,

659
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:10,897
and I think just now more,

660
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:12,239
it's more part of popular culture

661
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:15,726
of celebrities playing
in the field, which--

662
00:22:15,726 --> 00:22:16,815
- What do you mean,
like, Brad and Angelina

663
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:17,959
when they were together had a Rose?

664
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:20,077
- Well, them, but then--
- or Fat Jewish?

665
00:22:20,077 --> 00:22:21,383
- Yeah, and then Fat Jewish, like,

666
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:25,854
so wine is becoming really
more part of American culture,

667
00:22:25,854 --> 00:22:27,410
and that I'm excited about, you know?

668
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,716
I mean, I'm excited about all of it,

669
00:22:28,716 --> 00:22:30,478
but I see a lot of that
kind of stuff happening.

670
00:22:30,478 --> 00:22:32,869
You know, the competition's
a lot stiffer now, right?

671
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:35,540
There's a lot more people
starting out like I did,

672
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,617
at the beginning, right, you know,

673
00:22:36,617 --> 00:22:38,538
just, like, doing whatever
they can, you know.

674
00:22:38,538 --> 00:22:40,513
I started, it was like,
fucking couch surfing.

675
00:22:40,513 --> 00:22:42,564
Like, wherever I had
free or extended terms

676
00:22:42,564 --> 00:22:45,331
is where I kind of hung my hat.

677
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:48,155
But you're starting to see
lots of small stuff everywhere,

678
00:22:48,155 --> 00:22:48,988
you know what I mean?

679
00:22:48,988 --> 00:22:50,045
Like, just, you know--
- You mean small producers?

680
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:52,963
- Small producers, I mean,
we live here in New York.

681
00:22:52,963 --> 00:22:54,221
You can sell anything.
- Yeah, of course.

682
00:22:54,221 --> 00:22:55,980
- But, like, even just across the country,

683
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,156
even the rise of natural
wine, domestic and foreign,

684
00:23:00,156 --> 00:23:02,447
has really really hit New York hard,

685
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,150
and it's trickling out into other states,

686
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,889
but you definitely see that, but,

687
00:23:05,889 --> 00:23:06,933
on the production side, I would say

688
00:23:06,933 --> 00:23:09,355
you're seeing a lot more sparkling wine.

689
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:11,837
- Mary Kate, what are your readers, like,

690
00:23:11,837 --> 00:23:13,570
when it comes to wine, what's working,

691
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,029
like, what are people paying attention to?

692
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:18,214
What are some of those more
viral stories through the years?

693
00:23:18,214 --> 00:23:20,188
- Well, definitely Rose, and Rose in like,

694
00:23:20,188 --> 00:23:22,403
any kind of facet they can find it,

695
00:23:22,403 --> 00:23:26,513
so it's Rose cocktails, it's
froze, it's frozen Rose.

696
00:23:26,513 --> 00:23:28,903
But wine is more like
a lifestyle for them,

697
00:23:28,903 --> 00:23:31,749
so wine to pair with your book club,

698
00:23:31,749 --> 00:23:34,720
wine to pair when it's just yourself,

699
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,030
wine to pair with foods,
wine to pair with events,

700
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,960
holidays, I mean, it really is,

701
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,284
they see it lifestyle first, which I love,

702
00:23:43,284 --> 00:23:45,556
because then it means
they're drinking more of it,

703
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:49,263
but it's more the lifestyle aspect first.

704
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:50,259
- Wait, they're not nerding out,

705
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:51,413
they're not studying it,

706
00:23:51,413 --> 00:23:53,215
they're not collecting it,
- No, no, no, no, no.

707
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:55,392
- they're not trying to
figure out every nuance of it.

708
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,808
- Sure, and like, standard price points,

709
00:23:57,808 --> 00:23:59,970
region, that comes into play, but really,

710
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,292
more like how to serve it and
where and when to serve it,

711
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:04,917
really is, like, fascinating to them.

712
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:05,750
I love that.

713
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,583
- Yeah, that's so cool.
- Let's go sniffy sniff

714
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:07,836
on this.

715
00:24:07,836 --> 00:24:09,604
This has a totally different
nose than the first wine.

716
00:24:09,604 --> 00:24:10,911
This is also a white wine.

717
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:12,222
- [Erin] It's spicy.

718
00:24:12,222 --> 00:24:13,714
- [Mary Kate] Really, I don't smell that.

719
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:15,519
- I smell, like, a little bit of vanilla.

720
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:16,352
- [Erin] Yeah.

721
00:24:16,352 --> 00:24:17,978
- There's a ton of vanilla.

722
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:18,811
Do you smell that?

723
00:24:18,811 --> 00:24:20,097
- [Andre] Um-hm.

724
00:24:20,097 --> 00:24:21,838
- You got that, Trouty?

725
00:24:21,838 --> 00:24:24,597
Over there in the
bleacher seats over there?

726
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:26,881
You and Nate with your rivalry?

727
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:28,580
- [Mary Kate] I really hope
you guys survive today.

728
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,068
- No, there's a ton of vanilla bean

729
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:30,901
going on here.
- I thought you were gonna say

730
00:24:30,901 --> 00:24:32,821
there's a ton of rivalry.

731
00:24:32,821 --> 00:24:34,214
- All right, let's give it a whirl.

732
00:24:34,214 --> 00:24:37,547
(slurping and swishing)

733
00:24:42,511 --> 00:24:43,424
I'm spitting the wine.

734
00:24:43,424 --> 00:24:45,136
The rest of the crew here is drinking it

735
00:24:45,136 --> 00:24:46,968
directly to the face.

736
00:24:46,968 --> 00:24:48,328
- It's too far for me to grab

737
00:24:48,328 --> 00:24:49,161
so I'll just have a better day
- Erin just finished

738
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:50,589
her entire glass.
- And be a little drunk.

739
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:51,422
- I'm just kidding. (laughing)

740
00:24:51,422 --> 00:24:52,255
- Erin and I are gonna roll out of here.

741
00:24:52,255 --> 00:24:53,455
- We're about to talk later,

742
00:24:53,455 --> 00:24:55,396
the second half (laughing)

743
00:24:55,396 --> 00:24:56,786
- I'm changing the format.
- The slurring half?

744
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:57,640
- I'm changing the format.

745
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,215
Since this is audio and not visual--

746
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:00,048
- He's calling the audible.

747
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:00,881
- I feel like we're gonna talk

748
00:25:00,881 --> 00:25:02,212
a little bit about the wines now.

749
00:25:02,212 --> 00:25:03,568
So, let's do that.

750
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,664
I don't wanna sway opinions, but,

751
00:25:05,664 --> 00:25:06,930
Mary Kate, we'll start with you.

752
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,792
- [Mary Kate] So, we're not
saying what we liked better,

753
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:10,108
we're just talking about this wine?

754
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:12,483
- You're talking about this
specific wine, this white wine.

755
00:25:12,483 --> 00:25:13,418
- [Mary Kate] Mm-hm, so--

756
00:25:13,418 --> 00:25:14,850
- Is it fresh, is it heavy?

757
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:15,683
- It's definitely--
- Do you love it,

758
00:25:15,683 --> 00:25:16,516
do you hate it?

759
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:17,503
- I, well, that's rating it--
- Let me start,

760
00:25:17,503 --> 00:25:18,804
I did not like the first wine.

761
00:25:18,804 --> 00:25:20,849
- [Mary Kate] I hated the
first wine, it reminded me

762
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:22,630
of my grandmother.
- Andre?

763
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,624
- Not that I hate
- Only if I had it

764
00:25:23,624 --> 00:25:25,167
with oysters.
- my grandmother, mind you.

765
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:26,879
- But off the straight up, it's okay.

766
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:27,875
- [Gary] Now remember, we're tasting--

767
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:28,762
- [Erin] What, the
first wine or this wine?

768
00:25:28,762 --> 00:25:29,595
- [Gary And Andre] First wine.

769
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:31,322
- Just for everybody at
home, Erin, first wine?

770
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:32,675
Loved it.

771
00:25:32,675 --> 00:25:33,590
- [Erin] Yeah, I like oysters,

772
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,995
that's why, I thought of, oysters.

773
00:25:34,995 --> 00:25:36,538
- (laughing) What about the wine?

774
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:38,008
- [Erin] Yeah, but it's
like, it's a kind of a wine

775
00:25:38,008 --> 00:25:39,840
that you have at Mary's
Fish Camp, I don't know.

776
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,970
- Understood, understood.

777
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:44,331
So, one thing for everybody
who's into wine a little bit,

778
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:46,637
we're tasting these wines
at room temperature.

779
00:25:46,637 --> 00:25:49,161
And so, white wines get really
exposed, you're fine, Erin,

780
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:50,773
white wines get very exposed

781
00:25:50,773 --> 00:25:51,705
when they're at room temperature

782
00:25:51,705 --> 00:25:54,105
'cause the cold is not hiding it.

783
00:25:54,105 --> 00:25:55,982
I always called it, like, you know,

784
00:25:55,982 --> 00:25:57,891
kind of like the high school beer rule.

785
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:59,873
Like, when you're drinking Natty Lite,

786
00:25:59,873 --> 00:26:03,774
or Milwaukee's Best, which
is Marcus's favorite,

787
00:26:03,774 --> 00:26:07,472
the beast, like, you get it
as cold as fucking possible

788
00:26:07,472 --> 00:26:09,765
because you don't wanna taste it, right?

789
00:26:09,765 --> 00:26:11,292
So one of the reasons I've
always tasted white wine

790
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:14,035
at room temperature, is I
actually wanted to taste it,

791
00:26:14,035 --> 00:26:16,431
because if you get this
ice, if wine number one

792
00:26:16,431 --> 00:26:19,527
was dead ice cold, we'd
be like, yeah, okay, cool.

793
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:20,362
Refreshing!

794
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:21,642
- I wish you'd explained this before,

795
00:26:21,642 --> 00:26:22,649
because I just thought that this was

796
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:24,957
like a beat, like, wine tasting,

797
00:26:24,957 --> 00:26:26,111
I was like ah, this wine so so warm!

798
00:26:26,111 --> 00:26:27,359
- No.
- Gary just gave you guys

799
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,192
a pro tip.

800
00:26:28,192 --> 00:26:29,407
That's real shit right there.
- That's great, I love it,

801
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:30,943
it's so true, it's opened up so much.

802
00:26:30,943 --> 00:26:33,523
- Yeah, you hide flaws in wine by cold,

803
00:26:33,523 --> 00:26:35,419
by chilling them and
making them colder, yeah.

804
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:36,252
- That first bottle

805
00:26:36,252 --> 00:26:37,180
was like a Capri Sun.
- Cold wines is like

806
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,892
over-make-upped individuals.

807
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:42,405
You can hide anything, got it?

808
00:26:42,405 --> 00:26:45,250
- Yeah, that's why my
drink is Rose on ice.

809
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,641
(all laughing)

810
00:26:46,641 --> 00:26:48,185
That's my drink.
- Real literally, with cubes?

811
00:26:48,185 --> 00:26:49,520
- [Erin] That's literally my drink, yeah.

812
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,407
- You drink with ice cubes?

813
00:26:51,407 --> 00:26:52,240
- [Erin] Yeah.

814
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,537
- Yeah, I get it.
- It's all good.

815
00:26:53,537 --> 00:26:56,859
- Mollet had a sparkling
wine that they promoted

816
00:26:56,859 --> 00:26:58,567
as with cubes, right?
- Yeah, that's right,

817
00:26:58,567 --> 00:26:59,575
yeah, yeah.
- And has it done well?

818
00:26:59,575 --> 00:27:00,959
- I haven't seen it in the market.

819
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:03,883
The only way I've seen it is
'cause my boy was one of their,

820
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:05,229
he was one of their like--

821
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:06,497
- Homies.
- their ambassadors,

822
00:27:06,497 --> 00:27:07,931
that was going around with it, yeah.

823
00:27:07,931 --> 00:27:10,321
- What do you think about
all the wines in cans

824
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:12,231
and, like, new formats of delivery?

825
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:14,726
Like, I'm so amazed.
- Ooh, did you see Underwood?

826
00:27:14,726 --> 00:27:15,559
- Yeah.

827
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:17,106
- [Erin] I liked that,
they had Rose in a can.

828
00:27:17,106 --> 00:27:19,543
- And Argo, Ramona, like, there's so many

829
00:27:19,543 --> 00:27:20,376
out there now.
- They're actually just

830
00:27:20,376 --> 00:27:23,951
coming out with, I think July
13th they're coming out with--

831
00:27:23,951 --> 00:27:24,912
- [Gary] July 13th was yesterday.

832
00:27:24,912 --> 00:27:26,541
My sister's birthday, happy
birthday, Liz, I love you.

833
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:27,374
- Aww!
- Happy birthday!

834
00:27:27,374 --> 00:27:28,207
- I have a sister.
- Happy birthday, Liz.

835
00:27:28,207 --> 00:27:29,145
- All right, go ahead.

836
00:27:29,145 --> 00:27:31,528
- Right, yeah, yeah,
your wife, yeah, got it.

837
00:27:31,528 --> 00:27:33,837
- No, my wife's name is Liz,
my sister's name is Liz.

838
00:27:33,837 --> 00:27:34,670
- Got it, I thought

839
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,503
there was two Liz.
- I only like Lizzes.

840
00:27:35,503 --> 00:27:36,336
- There you go, there you go.

841
00:27:36,336 --> 00:27:37,169
- Mary Kate, you need to

842
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:38,002
change your name.
- I just changed my name

843
00:27:38,002 --> 00:27:39,710
right now, it's also pure Liz.
- Wine in a can is great.

844
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,006
I think it, is it for everybody?

845
00:27:42,006 --> 00:27:44,489
I think wine is this big long train

846
00:27:44,489 --> 00:27:46,620
that you can get on at
any time that you want,

847
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,191
get on and off, so if
you're into wine in a can,

848
00:27:49,191 --> 00:27:50,241
I think it's great.

849
00:27:50,241 --> 00:27:52,213
I like the stuff from
Underwood, I think it's great.

850
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:54,371
I think the breakout--
- It gets really cold, right?

851
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:55,624
With the can.
- The breakout is

852
00:27:55,624 --> 00:27:56,457
the wine cooler.
- Can I ask a really

853
00:27:56,457 --> 00:27:57,453
quotidian question?

854
00:27:57,453 --> 00:27:58,807
- [Andrea And Gary] Yes.

855
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:00,087
- Are you supposed to drink it in the can

856
00:28:00,087 --> 00:28:01,683
like a beer?
- You don't have to, no.

857
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:02,516
And actually, that's--

858
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:03,572
- There's no supposed to!

859
00:28:03,572 --> 00:28:05,524
- You're right, you're right.
- If we're gonna get

860
00:28:05,524 --> 00:28:08,010
anything across in Brown Bags Episode One,

861
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:08,843
it's there's no suppo-,

862
00:28:08,843 --> 00:28:11,123
you wanna fucking funnel
that wine right now?

863
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:12,337
Funnel it.
- Yeah, that's right.

864
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:14,149
- You wanna drink it out of a,

865
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:15,374
like plastic bag?
- Like straw.

866
00:28:15,374 --> 00:28:16,207
- Good.

867
00:28:16,207 --> 00:28:19,889
Like, enough with like,
like, no, but this is real!

868
00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:22,435
We do this with wine, and we don't do this

869
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:23,268
with everything else.

870
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,412
- Because it tastes different
in a can, that's my point.

871
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,245
- Great!

872
00:28:26,245 --> 00:28:27,457
- [Erin] And it was good.

873
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:28,905
I like new experiences, though,

874
00:28:28,905 --> 00:28:30,868
I liked, it's drier--
- Tell us about that, Erin.

875
00:28:30,868 --> 00:28:32,747
(all laughing)

876
00:28:32,747 --> 00:28:34,218
- There's, I like breaking the rules,

877
00:28:34,218 --> 00:28:35,640
and it's like, this is weird, but.

878
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,459
- It's dangerous, though, right?

879
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:38,717
'cause that's a half bottle of wine

880
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:39,953
and people drink it like beer?

881
00:28:39,953 --> 00:28:41,104
That's the thing.
- Oh, trust me, I'm the

882
00:28:41,104 --> 00:28:43,412
most fun Mary Kate after a can of wine.

883
00:28:43,412 --> 00:28:44,245
(all laughing)

884
00:28:44,245 --> 00:28:45,677
- [Andre] Yeah, but I just think that--

885
00:28:45,677 --> 00:28:46,813
- How bout after three?
- if you wanted to shoot it,

886
00:28:46,813 --> 00:28:48,710
you can, whatever you
want to do today is great.

887
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,543
- When do you switch from the most fun,

888
00:28:49,543 --> 00:28:51,967
to throwing up on people, six cans?

889
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:53,462
- I haven't thrown up
on people in a while,

890
00:28:53,462 --> 00:28:54,841
but yes, after three glasses--

891
00:28:54,841 --> 00:28:57,871
- Let's get serious here,
let's turn it up, Brown Bags.

892
00:28:57,871 --> 00:28:58,704
- [Andre] Oh, here we go.

893
00:28:58,704 --> 00:28:59,537
- Here we go.

894
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,260
We're only at wine two,
we've got three more to go.

895
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,498
Mary Kate, when is the last
time that you threw up?

896
00:29:03,498 --> 00:29:05,329
- Like, hungover thew up, all right.

897
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:07,172
- Not like you ate a weird oyster.

898
00:29:07,172 --> 00:29:11,815
- It's, as Gary knows, and most
of the team here now knows,

899
00:29:11,815 --> 00:29:15,289
I do like to go out and have a good time.

900
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:16,775
And I do have two children,

901
00:29:16,775 --> 00:29:18,319
so those two worlds clash.
- They'll listen to this

902
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,976
eventually, 'cause I'll
be popular with them

903
00:29:19,976 --> 00:29:20,964
'cause I'm skewing younger, but,

904
00:29:20,964 --> 00:29:22,302
for now, they're very young,

905
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,155
so they won't hear this.
- I think Jackson

906
00:29:23,155 --> 00:29:24,468
more than Charlie.

907
00:29:24,468 --> 00:29:27,209
We're worried about Charlie's
entrepreneurial skills.

908
00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:28,474
Yeah, definitely this past year.

909
00:29:28,474 --> 00:29:30,169
I definitely-
- You threw up?

910
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:31,546
- Oh, for sure!

911
00:29:31,546 --> 00:29:32,379
- Paint us a--

912
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:33,212
(Andre laughing)

913
00:29:33,212 --> 00:29:34,045
- For sure.

914
00:29:34,045 --> 00:29:34,878
- [Gary] I'm so proud of you.

915
00:29:34,878 --> 00:29:36,117
- For sure.

916
00:29:36,117 --> 00:29:38,725
I, like, I don't say no to a fun time.

917
00:29:38,725 --> 00:29:39,807
Yeah, for sure.

918
00:29:39,807 --> 00:29:42,085
Oh my gosh, it's so embarrassing,
I could probably just--

919
00:29:42,085 --> 00:29:44,588
- In the last 365 days, you threw up

920
00:29:44,588 --> 00:29:45,456
from too much alcohol consumption.

921
00:29:45,456 --> 00:29:47,238
- I thought I just said
for sure five times.

922
00:29:47,238 --> 00:29:49,348
Yeah, I'll text Anna, my
best friend, right now

923
00:29:49,348 --> 00:29:51,164
and see what--
- What the exact date was.

924
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,519
- She knows.

925
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:53,352
Anna.

926
00:29:53,352 --> 00:29:54,185
- That's pretty amazing.
- What about you?

927
00:29:54,185 --> 00:29:55,331
- [Erin] I don't vom.

928
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:56,164
- You don't vom?

929
00:29:56,164 --> 00:29:59,212
- No, I don't, no, I'm Irish.

930
00:29:59,212 --> 00:30:00,396
- Yeah, I didn't know that throwing up

931
00:30:00,396 --> 00:30:03,620
was now called vom, but I'm
pretty fired up about that.

932
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,677
Now it's called vom.
- Now we all know

933
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,066
I've contributed something
today. (laughing)

934
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:08,536
- Opinions are being contributed.

935
00:30:08,536 --> 00:30:11,069
Erin, what do you think
about wine number two?

936
00:30:11,069 --> 00:30:13,319
- Wine number two, hang on.

937
00:30:16,157 --> 00:30:16,990
I mean--

938
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:19,402
- This is, remember--
- Are we sharing as we go now?

939
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:21,214
- [Gary] Yes, we're sharing
as we go, I changed the rules.

940
00:30:21,214 --> 00:30:22,064
- [Mary Kate] Oh, I got a little cinnamon.

941
00:30:22,064 --> 00:30:25,551
- [Gary] We're gonna vom
our opinions to each other.

942
00:30:25,551 --> 00:30:27,914
- (laughing) I mean, I rarely meet a wine

943
00:30:27,914 --> 00:30:29,779
I don't like, unless I'm on

944
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:31,428
American Airlines.
- You're gonna like all five.

945
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:32,905
Understood
- Like this, I mean--

946
00:30:32,905 --> 00:30:33,924
- [Gary] Compare this to wine number one.

947
00:30:33,924 --> 00:30:35,337
- I mean, I'm kind of
upset that everyone's like,

948
00:30:35,337 --> 00:30:36,371
hating on the first one.

949
00:30:36,371 --> 00:30:37,398
- [Gary] Don't be!

950
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:38,523
- 'Cause I like the first one.

951
00:30:38,523 --> 00:30:39,360
- You may be a pioneer.

952
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,292
We may unveil it, it might
be one of the highest rated--

953
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:43,076
- [Erin] Just trailblazing
the white wine today.

954
00:30:43,076 --> 00:30:44,515
- Yeah, what do you think about this wine?

955
00:30:44,515 --> 00:30:47,721
- I think it's all right, I think that--

956
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:48,554
- [Gary] Is it too soft?

957
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:51,103
Do you feel like the subtleties
compared to wine number one

958
00:30:51,103 --> 00:30:52,871
and that makes it a little boring for you?

959
00:30:52,871 --> 00:30:53,915
'Cause I see a boring face.

960
00:30:53,915 --> 00:30:56,091
- It's like, spicy, like I
said when I first smelled it.

961
00:30:56,091 --> 00:30:58,467
There's something spicier about
this one than the first one,

962
00:30:58,467 --> 00:31:01,493
and I like, even coffee
too, I like things,

963
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:04,628
like, I like instant
coffee, and Dunkin' Donuts.

964
00:31:04,628 --> 00:31:06,682
Like, that, do you know what I mean?

965
00:31:06,682 --> 00:31:09,554
There's like, I don't
know if it's like acidic?

966
00:31:09,554 --> 00:31:12,717
I like, when I ask for
wine, I ask for miner,

967
00:31:12,717 --> 00:31:13,786
- [Erin And Gary] minerality.

968
00:31:13,786 --> 00:31:15,571
- [Gary] Okay, Andre, wine number two?

969
00:31:15,571 --> 00:31:19,071
- Wine number two, vanilla, slightly oaky,

970
00:31:20,758 --> 00:31:21,953
some cinnamon.
- Do you like it?

971
00:31:21,953 --> 00:31:23,126
- You know, I think it has its place.

972
00:31:23,126 --> 00:31:24,027
Yeah, it's pretty decent.

973
00:31:24,027 --> 00:31:25,799
- [Gary] But you seem bored by it.

974
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,809
- Yeah, I'm not, you know, I'm not,

975
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:28,984
My socks aren't blown off--
- Writin' home.

976
00:31:28,984 --> 00:31:29,817
- or anything like that.

977
00:31:29,817 --> 00:31:31,755
- [Gary] Compared to wine number one?

978
00:31:31,755 --> 00:31:33,645
- I found wine number one maybe to be

979
00:31:33,645 --> 00:31:35,735
a little bit more interesting
because it was funky,

980
00:31:35,735 --> 00:31:37,090
right, because it wasn't,

981
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:40,129
as this wine seems a
little bit more technical

982
00:31:40,129 --> 00:31:41,345
and laboratory-made in that way,

983
00:31:41,345 --> 00:31:43,029
where the other wine
seemed to have, like--

984
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:44,800
- A little flavor.
- Some savage to it, right?

985
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,372
- Yeah, Mary Kate?
- Some funk to it.

986
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:47,205
- Understood.

987
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,959
- I definitely like this one better.

988
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:49,960
This is more my jam.

989
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,388
This feels like
ladies-who-lunch white wine.

990
00:31:52,388 --> 00:31:54,510
Like, this gets the job done,

991
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,625
this can be consumed in mass quantities.

992
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,570
One, that's interesting
that you say that about one,

993
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,111
because I thought at first it was swill,

994
00:32:01,111 --> 00:32:03,148
but now I do have a
little bit more respect

995
00:32:03,148 --> 00:32:04,915
that you say that,
like, I like the vanilla

996
00:32:04,915 --> 00:32:07,890
and cinnamon of this, this
is an easy drinking white,

997
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,209
but now I'm super curious,
because maybe you're right,

998
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:14,042
maybe one has a nuance there that,

999
00:32:15,473 --> 00:32:18,280
Gary served it at, like,
warm-ass temperature

1000
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,964
but maybe chilled, maybe
I'd have a different taste.

1001
00:32:20,964 --> 00:32:23,083
- 'cause right now, all
the wines, they taste hot.

1002
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:24,619
The alcohol is really amplified, right?

1003
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:26,047
So that's what we're tasting, right?

1004
00:32:26,047 --> 00:32:28,534
- So for me, the good news
is, I have more self-esteem

1005
00:32:28,534 --> 00:32:30,960
than Mary Kate, and can
stick to my own opinions.

1006
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,602
- Wait, when did you get--
- I wasn't succumbed,

1007
00:32:32,602 --> 00:32:34,439
I wasn't persuaded by Andre's,

1008
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:38,029
so for me, I really love
the wine number two,

1009
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:39,783
and don't like wine number one.

1010
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:42,684
I wasn't persuaded by Andre's
charm like Mary Kate was.

1011
00:32:42,684 --> 00:32:44,719
- He gave me the love eyes.
- I feel like I'm a very

1012
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:46,261
big fan of wine number two.

1013
00:32:46,261 --> 00:32:48,276
I feel like it's interesting
where you're coming,

1014
00:32:48,276 --> 00:32:49,531
I'm really curious what wine--
- Should I go back in

1015
00:32:49,531 --> 00:32:50,364
and see what Gary's talking about?

1016
00:32:50,364 --> 00:32:51,790
- You can do anything you want.

1017
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,583
I think what's really
interesting to me is,

1018
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:56,684
as you were talking, 'cause I
respect your palate so much,

1019
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:58,533
I'm like, huh, 'cause for me,

1020
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:02,322
wine number two is so well balanced,

1021
00:33:02,322 --> 00:33:05,828
and is it so integrated, fruit, acidity,

1022
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:07,841
structure-wise, or, is it boring?

1023
00:33:07,841 --> 00:33:09,903
Like, this is where it gets
sometimes super interesting

1024
00:33:09,903 --> 00:33:12,971
with wines, when it's so, and you said it,

1025
00:33:12,971 --> 00:33:14,103
this is why this is fun.

1026
00:33:14,103 --> 00:33:15,793
It doesn't matter what
angle you come from.

1027
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:19,374
All of us were wildly,
interestingly saying the same thing.

1028
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:22,391
You said it in your way, like,

1029
00:33:22,391 --> 00:33:24,965
you like the radness of wine
number one, the spiciness,

1030
00:33:24,965 --> 00:33:26,714
you were like basically trying to Erin,

1031
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:28,639
articulate your thoughts
on it, but basically,

1032
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,996
what you were saying is, it's seamless,

1033
00:33:30,996 --> 00:33:33,246
and either boring or clean.

1034
00:33:34,214 --> 00:33:36,401
You were saying that, and you, Mary Kate,

1035
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:39,148
you were saying, it's, you
know, it gets the job done.

1036
00:33:39,148 --> 00:33:41,332
People will like it, because
what you were reacting to

1037
00:33:41,332 --> 00:33:43,086
was that seamlessness.

1038
00:33:43,086 --> 00:33:44,681
Nothing was out of whack.

1039
00:33:44,681 --> 00:33:46,454
There wasn't anything too aggressive,

1040
00:33:46,454 --> 00:33:49,100
and that either means,

1041
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,203
that it's a boring-ass
wine that is too technical,

1042
00:33:53,203 --> 00:33:55,870
and it's funny how you broke it down,

1043
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:58,462
and it's kind of like a cliche wine

1044
00:33:58,462 --> 00:34:00,835
that like is on supermarket
shelves at Albertsons

1045
00:34:00,835 --> 00:34:02,891
and everybody can like it, or,

1046
00:34:02,891 --> 00:34:05,535
it means it's like a
white burgundy-like wine

1047
00:34:05,535 --> 00:34:10,272
or a producer that's making
a seamless integration.

1048
00:34:10,272 --> 00:34:12,333
Now I'm excited to see
what wine number two is.

1049
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,050
- I have a question for you.
- Go ahead, let's dump,

1050
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:15,174
we're gonna go to wine number three.

1051
00:34:15,174 --> 00:34:19,341
- I have a question about boring
wine versus exciting wine.

1052
00:34:20,512 --> 00:34:22,202
See, I don't like cabernet.

1053
00:34:22,202 --> 00:34:25,277
Is that what people, is it, is it just,

1054
00:34:25,277 --> 00:34:26,938
because it's not boring?

1055
00:34:26,938 --> 00:34:28,123
It's like two-
- Well, why don't you like it?

1056
00:34:28,123 --> 00:34:32,303
- Because it's so much.
- It's too powerful?

1057
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:35,089
- Yeah, and maybe, like, it
just has a lot happening?

1058
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:37,775
- It's a heavy red wine.
- It's heavy.

1059
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:38,954
Like, I don't like cabernet.

1060
00:34:38,955 --> 00:34:41,118
I don't know why it's so popular,

1061
00:34:41,118 --> 00:34:43,106
but maybe they're bored by pinots.

1062
00:34:43,106 --> 00:34:44,822
- But you know, I think
also, like, cabernet,

1063
00:34:44,822 --> 00:34:47,340
a new world cabernet, like, you know it--

1064
00:34:47,341 --> 00:34:48,955
- And when he means new world cabernet,

1065
00:34:48,955 --> 00:34:50,203
for everybody listening-
- Sorry.

1066
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:51,607
- No, no worries, you
keep doing your thing,

1067
00:34:51,607 --> 00:34:52,569
that's what I'm here for.

1068
00:34:52,569 --> 00:34:54,797
He's talking about like
Napa Valley cabernets,

1069
00:34:54,797 --> 00:34:56,922
like not the cabernet-based
wines from Bordeaux

1070
00:34:56,922 --> 00:34:59,532
or even Tuscany, like, new world cabernets

1071
00:34:59,532 --> 00:35:00,680
are gonna have a lot of fruit.

1072
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,498
They're the Silver Oaks and the Caymuses

1073
00:35:02,498 --> 00:35:03,821
and the Harlans that a lot of you know,

1074
00:35:03,821 --> 00:35:05,421
if you're into wines, so keep going.

1075
00:35:05,421 --> 00:35:07,322
- Yeah, no, but like,
the whole fact is, like,

1076
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:09,878
coming new to a wine, like,
it's made from grapes, right?

1077
00:35:09,878 --> 00:35:11,297
It's made from fruit.

1078
00:35:11,297 --> 00:35:12,419
Most people, there's an association,

1079
00:35:12,419 --> 00:35:13,809
why doesn't it taste sweet?

1080
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:15,676
Why does it not taste this way?

1081
00:35:15,676 --> 00:35:18,551
And I think what happens
is, is that you have,

1082
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:20,168
you have something like this.

1083
00:35:20,168 --> 00:35:22,513
People are attracted to
something that's overripe

1084
00:35:22,513 --> 00:35:24,657
and that tastes like jam, in some ways,

1085
00:35:24,657 --> 00:35:25,903
and that's not a bad way.

1086
00:35:25,903 --> 00:35:28,175
I think that's how I started.

1087
00:35:28,175 --> 00:35:30,028
And the fact of it is, is that, you know,

1088
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:32,291
as Americans, we have a sweet palate.

1089
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:34,241
Right, there's nothing wrong with that.

1090
00:35:34,241 --> 00:35:36,518
We invented the cocktail,
during Prohibition,

1091
00:35:36,518 --> 00:35:38,159
to cover up shitty booze.

1092
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,336
- Yeah, we like sweets.

1093
00:35:39,336 --> 00:35:40,437
Erin, are all these,
- I love that, I've never

1094
00:35:40,437 --> 00:35:41,270
thought of it like that.

1095
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,504
- Are all these impressive
dudes that you date

1096
00:35:43,504 --> 00:35:46,276
like, trying to impress you
with, like, high-end cabernet,

1097
00:35:46,276 --> 00:35:47,135
and do you feel like maybe
- Oh, I love where

1098
00:35:47,135 --> 00:35:48,294
this is going.
- that's why you hate it?

1099
00:35:48,294 --> 00:35:49,127
- [Erin] That's where I learned it.

1100
00:35:49,127 --> 00:35:51,226
- This is so much better now.
- Did I nail that?

1101
00:35:51,226 --> 00:35:53,037
- Yes, you nailed it,

1102
00:35:53,037 --> 00:35:54,482
like on the beat.
- I think the first half

1103
00:35:54,482 --> 00:35:56,008
of this podcast now goes in the garbage

1104
00:35:56,008 --> 00:35:56,841
and we just start here.

1105
00:35:56,841 --> 00:35:58,203
- [Gary] Well, yeah, we've
gotten to the vom part,

1106
00:35:58,203 --> 00:36:00,134
now we're gonna get to
into Erin's dating life.

1107
00:36:00,134 --> 00:36:00,967
- I'm still waiting

1108
00:36:00,967 --> 00:36:01,800
for the text.
- Which is gonna be

1109
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,633
far more interesting.

1110
00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:03,772
But I checked, when you
were saying that, I'm like,

1111
00:36:03,772 --> 00:36:04,933
oh, I bet you,

1112
00:36:04,933 --> 00:36:05,802
that she's going out
- Oh yes, you're so right.

1113
00:36:05,802 --> 00:36:08,468
with these dudes who are
ordering, like, the fucking like,

1114
00:36:08,468 --> 00:36:09,663
you know which ones,

1115
00:36:09,663 --> 00:36:10,496
Nate's sitting,
I yell at them, I'm like

1116
00:36:10,496 --> 00:36:11,369
I don't like cabaret.
- Nate's sitting right

1117
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,527
behind you.
- I've told you four times.

1118
00:36:12,527 --> 00:36:14,343
- So I was able to see Nate's
face while you were talking,

1119
00:36:14,343 --> 00:36:16,571
like, oh, that would be the
bullshit that Nate would pull.

1120
00:36:16,571 --> 00:36:19,939
He would buy, like a boring cabernet.

1121
00:36:19,939 --> 00:36:21,595
Trouty, I know you
wouldn't order a cabernet.

1122
00:36:21,595 --> 00:36:23,345
You're super bougie,

1123
00:36:24,211 --> 00:36:26,468
you would order some wine
that would confuse the girl.

1124
00:36:26,468 --> 00:36:28,511
She would leave, like, while
she went to the bathroom,

1125
00:36:28,511 --> 00:36:31,084
and you'd be sitting there
drinking your Gamay by yourself.

1126
00:36:31,084 --> 00:36:32,334
- Gamay, Gamay!

1127
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,075
That's my first favorite wine.

1128
00:36:36,075 --> 00:36:36,908
- Trouty!

1129
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,410
- [Mary Kate] Any girl Trouty dates,

1130
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,245
definitely likes Rose in a can.

1131
00:36:41,245 --> 00:36:43,883
- No, but Erin, Erin, like, that literally

1132
00:36:43,883 --> 00:36:46,505
is how it's hit your radar, the cabernet.

1133
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:48,885
- [Erin] Well, yeah, I mean, like,

1134
00:36:48,885 --> 00:36:51,180
that's how I learned about all wine.

1135
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,781
You know, my first
boyfriend was Swiss French,

1136
00:36:52,781 --> 00:36:55,153
and we for four years
lived in London and Paris.

1137
00:36:55,153 --> 00:36:56,507
- Was he much older than you?

1138
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:58,312
- No, no, four years.
- Oh, interesting.

1139
00:36:58,312 --> 00:37:00,231
I missed it, I thought it was like 11.

1140
00:37:00,231 --> 00:37:02,009
- [Mary Kate] Yeah, I was
kind of hoping for 11.

1141
00:37:02,009 --> 00:37:03,301
- I was kinda hoping for like 30.

1142
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:04,968
I was hoping she was 20

1143
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:05,801
- My parents are 11 years apart.

1144
00:37:05,801 --> 00:37:07,239
- Yes, yes, yes.
- My parents are

1145
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,153
11 years apart.
- Erin, can you just pretend

1146
00:37:08,153 --> 00:37:08,986
he is 54?

1147
00:37:08,986 --> 00:37:10,115
- Your parents are 11 years apart?

1148
00:37:10,115 --> 00:37:11,725
- [Erin] Yeah, they're
kicking, they're going.

1149
00:37:11,725 --> 00:37:13,220
They're fine.
- Okay, they're goin'.

1150
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,835
All right, wine number three.

1151
00:37:14,835 --> 00:37:16,587
What are we, let's sniffy sniff.

1152
00:37:16,587 --> 00:37:17,647
- I love it on the nose.
- Sniffy sniff.

1153
00:37:17,647 --> 00:37:18,515
- What are you getting on
the nose, the nose itself?

1154
00:37:18,515 --> 00:37:21,555
- [Mary Kate] This is like September,

1155
00:37:21,555 --> 00:37:23,295
New York Fashion Week, back into New York,

1156
00:37:23,295 --> 00:37:25,262
definitely drinking red.
- Yeah see, there you go.

1157
00:37:25,262 --> 00:37:26,095
- [Gary] Now you're getting it, Mary Kate.

1158
00:37:26,095 --> 00:37:28,067
- All the berries, I love this.

1159
00:37:28,067 --> 00:37:28,900
- Andre.
- This like, hits all

1160
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,733
of that moment.
- Potpourri at my

1161
00:37:29,733 --> 00:37:31,869
grandmamma's house, you know what I mean?

1162
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:32,809
- Oh, totally different.
Some pencil shavings,

1163
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:33,661
some graphite.

1164
00:37:33,661 --> 00:37:34,954
- You can definitely smell the--

1165
00:37:34,954 --> 00:37:35,787
- [Erin] Graphite?

1166
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:36,620
- You can definitely

1167
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,453
smell the sweetness.
- Yeah from like

1168
00:37:37,453 --> 00:37:38,286
when you sharpen a pencil.

1169
00:37:38,286 --> 00:37:39,119
- It's from my like--
- I like the berry.

1170
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:39,952
- You can smell the sweetness.
- fourth grade

1171
00:37:39,952 --> 00:37:40,785
mechanical pencil.

1172
00:37:40,785 --> 00:37:42,492
- Absolutely, you'd go into smelling it,

1173
00:37:42,492 --> 00:37:44,593
expecting it to be sweet, right?

1174
00:37:44,593 --> 00:37:45,985
- 100%, all right,

1175
00:37:45,985 --> 00:37:46,818
let's give it a whirl.
- Where do you get

1176
00:37:46,818 --> 00:37:47,974
that graphite?

1177
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:48,842
- [Andre] I get graphite on there.

1178
00:37:48,842 --> 00:37:50,995
- I get graphite too, actually.

1179
00:37:50,995 --> 00:37:53,078
It's, you know what graphite
also sometimes smells like

1180
00:37:53,078 --> 00:37:54,038
if you're going through it?

1181
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,367
Metallic, it depends on
how you articulate it

1182
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:57,824
as an adjective,
- Yes, a tinny, yes.

1183
00:37:57,824 --> 00:38:00,303
- But this almost smells
like you took an aluminum bat

1184
00:38:00,303 --> 00:38:01,390
when you were, like, in Little League,

1185
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,074
and you had a bunch of strawberries,

1186
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:04,923
and you started smashing the strawberries,

1187
00:38:04,923 --> 00:38:07,817
and then you smelled the baseball
bat and the strawberries.

1188
00:38:07,817 --> 00:38:08,650
- [Mary Kate] Who does that?

1189
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,070
- You should write
- That's crazy.

1190
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:10,941
- children's books.

1191
00:38:10,941 --> 00:38:11,774
- [Andre] Gary does it.

1192
00:38:11,774 --> 00:38:13,026
- [Mary Kate] Who does that?

1193
00:38:13,026 --> 00:38:15,232
- No, this is like you went on a barbecue

1194
00:38:15,232 --> 00:38:17,977
and someone gave you a
piece of pie to take home

1195
00:38:17,977 --> 00:38:19,867
in aluminum, and then you opened it up.

1196
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:21,772
That's like the normal
thing, versus, like,

1197
00:38:21,772 --> 00:38:24,421
the physical violent way
that you experienced it.

1198
00:38:24,421 --> 00:38:25,254
- But listen,

1199
00:38:25,254 --> 00:38:27,260
let's not suppress the male--
- Delta first class.

1200
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,706
- Yeah, like, why are you
suppressing my male, like,

1201
00:38:29,706 --> 00:38:31,960
you're being way too
politically correct on me.

1202
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,691
Like, why can't I be a boy for a second?

1203
00:38:33,691 --> 00:38:35,580
- I have two of you at home,
- I'm sorry, yeah.

1204
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,429
- I built Legos this morning.

1205
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:40,081
That's actually baloney,
- Alexa, play the

1206
00:38:40,081 --> 00:38:41,204
Imperial March.
- I vomited this morning.

1207
00:38:41,204 --> 00:38:43,281
No don't, Alexa, I already
heard it this morning.

1208
00:38:43,281 --> 00:38:46,280
- [Alexa] The Imperial
March, Darth Vader's Theme,

1209
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,495
by John Williams and
London Symphony Orchestra.

1210
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:49,969
- She's added that.

1211
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:51,368
("Imperial March")

1212
00:38:51,368 --> 00:38:52,811
- So the reason this is playing,

1213
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:56,070
is Mary Kate's boys do that with Alexa

1214
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,129
every morning, and walk around.

1215
00:38:58,129 --> 00:38:59,881
- [Mary Kate] She stopped
because you said her name again.

1216
00:38:59,881 --> 00:39:00,841
- Yeah.

1217
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:02,560
Alexa, stop.

1218
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,227
So, Erin, what do you
think about this wine?

1219
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:08,117
- [Erin] What do I think about it?

1220
00:39:08,117 --> 00:39:09,885
I think, oh, I haven't tasted it yet.

1221
00:39:09,885 --> 00:39:11,296
- Well, please taste it, Mary Kate--

1222
00:39:11,296 --> 00:39:12,314
- I love it.
- Erin's way behind

1223
00:39:12,314 --> 00:39:13,771
and she's been smelling for, you love it.

1224
00:39:13,771 --> 00:39:15,130
- [Mary Kate] I love
it, it feels balanced,

1225
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,336
this feels delicious.
- Oh my god, I want this wine.

1226
00:39:17,336 --> 00:39:18,982
I need to know what this is after.

1227
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,305
It smelled amazing, that's
why I didn't stop smelling it.

1228
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:22,282
- [Mary Kate] I think
we just stay here now

1229
00:39:22,282 --> 00:39:23,115
for the rest of the day

1230
00:39:23,115 --> 00:39:23,948
and just jam this wine,
- What is this?

1231
00:39:23,948 --> 00:39:25,072
- and this wine alike.

1232
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:26,265
- It's like, what is it?
- Great business.

1233
00:39:26,265 --> 00:39:27,098
- Yeah, no, I think

1234
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,184
it's a great wine.
- But this is outrageous.

1235
00:39:28,184 --> 00:39:29,049
- I think it's pretty
well balanced, you know.

1236
00:39:29,049 --> 00:39:30,726
I'm torn over--
- Is it too sweet for you?

1237
00:39:30,726 --> 00:39:31,604
- A little bit.

1238
00:39:31,604 --> 00:39:33,609
I'm trying to figure
where that's coming from,

1239
00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:36,322
and, you know, so, and
it's reduced, right?

1240
00:39:36,322 --> 00:39:37,968
It's like someone took all of that stuff,

1241
00:39:37,968 --> 00:39:40,228
cooked it down and it's, like, stewing.

1242
00:39:40,228 --> 00:39:42,857
- It's Grenache-y that way, like, right?

1243
00:39:42,857 --> 00:39:43,690
- Yeah, no, absolutely.

1244
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,306
- So I'm gonna say something
for everybody listening.

1245
00:39:45,306 --> 00:39:47,002
Wine number three, and we'll link this

1246
00:39:47,002 --> 00:39:48,133
in, like, where we post it up,

1247
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:50,627
this is going to be, I'm not
sure what I think about it.

1248
00:39:50,627 --> 00:39:52,548
You notice that I also like it.

1249
00:39:52,548 --> 00:39:54,542
If you noticed how I asked Andre

1250
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:55,567
if he thought it was too sweet,

1251
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:58,725
it is a little too sweet, for me,

1252
00:39:58,725 --> 00:40:02,100
but I'm weirdly in the
mood for it to be sweet,

1253
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,683
meaning, because we're in July,

1254
00:40:05,562 --> 00:40:07,197
to me, this is a very intriguing

1255
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:08,353
barbecue wine.
- Yeah, absolutely.

1256
00:40:08,353 --> 00:40:09,630
- Like, as soon as I was
drinking, I was like, oh,

1257
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,802
you know, like, just BB,
- Oh, with some ribs.

1258
00:40:11,802 --> 00:40:13,861
- and like, just easy like, exactly.

1259
00:40:13,861 --> 00:40:14,694
Ribs is exactly

1260
00:40:14,694 --> 00:40:15,995
what I was getting.
- Salty, salty ribs, yeah.

1261
00:40:15,995 --> 00:40:17,411
- That's exactly right, actually.

1262
00:40:17,411 --> 00:40:18,915
- [Mary Kate] Also like a manchego cheese.

1263
00:40:18,915 --> 00:40:21,615
- If this is under $20, an
I have no idea what this is,

1264
00:40:21,615 --> 00:40:25,392
if this is under $20,
everybody who would buy it

1265
00:40:25,392 --> 00:40:26,548
would fucking love it.

1266
00:40:26,548 --> 00:40:28,179
- [Mary Kate] Oh yeah, if it's under $20,

1267
00:40:28,179 --> 00:40:30,261
PureWow will go bananas on this.

1268
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,688
- If it's under $20, will you commit

1269
00:40:31,688 --> 00:40:33,297
to buying a case at Wine Library?

1270
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:34,451
- Committed, two.
- At full cost,

1271
00:40:34,451 --> 00:40:36,240
full profit for me and my family?

1272
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,073
- [Mary Kate] Wait--

1273
00:40:37,073 --> 00:40:37,906
- Oh, I will, I'm committing,
- A case usually comes

1274
00:40:37,906 --> 00:40:38,739
at a discount.
- I will.

1275
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:39,749
- Okay, thank you, Erin.

1276
00:40:39,749 --> 00:40:41,698
- [Mary Kate] Erin, I
was in a negotiation.

1277
00:40:41,698 --> 00:40:42,564
- Oh sorry.

1278
00:40:42,564 --> 00:40:43,397
- No, Mary Kate,

1279
00:40:43,397 --> 00:40:44,240
you're out.
- You just, like totally,

1280
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,073
the business.
- You're out.

1281
00:40:45,073 --> 00:40:46,698
Erin, you're the new
editor-in-chief of PureWow.

1282
00:40:46,698 --> 00:40:47,685
Congratulations.

1283
00:40:47,685 --> 00:40:49,030
- [Mary Kate] It's
actually called GaryWow.

1284
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,080
- GaryWow, relaunching.

1285
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,913
- [Erin] I'm buying it

1286
00:40:51,913 --> 00:40:52,746
in bulk, Mary Kate.
- Andre, if you were

1287
00:40:52,746 --> 00:40:55,360
rating this on a 100 point
scale, where would you go?

1288
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,816
- You know, it's, you know, I mean,

1289
00:40:56,816 --> 00:40:59,523
I would look at it and probably--

1290
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:01,388
- Don't play to the mic.
- 89, 91.

1291
00:41:01,388 --> 00:41:02,449
- Okay, nice range.

1292
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:04,837
Yeah, me, I like this wine.

1293
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:05,938
All right, let's go to wine number four.

1294
00:41:05,938 --> 00:41:06,771
- You said what?

1295
00:41:06,771 --> 00:41:07,604
- 89 to 91.

1296
00:41:07,604 --> 00:41:08,437
- [Mary Kate] I need a new glass.

1297
00:41:08,437 --> 00:41:09,418
I don't want to part with this one.

1298
00:41:09,418 --> 00:41:10,749
- Just, just pound it, Mary Kate.

1299
00:41:10,749 --> 00:41:11,582
You can throw up again.

1300
00:41:11,582 --> 00:41:13,226
You can, you can vom.
- I'm still waiting

1301
00:41:13,226 --> 00:41:14,240
for the next vom.
- You can throw up again.

1302
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,073
- Super vom with us.

1303
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:15,906
- I'm glad that question didn't get

1304
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,023
passed my way.
- Gary, do you get hungover?

1305
00:41:17,023 --> 00:41:17,856
- I was just like, oh my god.

1306
00:41:17,856 --> 00:41:18,740
- You know what's funny?

1307
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:22,626
I never, ever get hungover,
except the weirdest thing.

1308
00:41:22,626 --> 00:41:25,793
I, for some reason, get drunk on sake.

1309
00:41:27,022 --> 00:41:28,163
I don't know why.

1310
00:41:28,163 --> 00:41:30,246
The last seven times I've been drunk,

1311
00:41:30,246 --> 00:41:32,454
have been eating at like high-end,

1312
00:41:32,454 --> 00:41:35,668
like, Japanese, like, sushi restaurants.

1313
00:41:35,668 --> 00:41:36,501
- [Mary Kate] I think I've seen you

1314
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:38,321
at like four in the morning,
and you've never been drunk.

1315
00:41:38,321 --> 00:41:39,764
- I don't drink that much.

1316
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:42,157
I'm never drunk, because I
always need to be in control.

1317
00:41:42,157 --> 00:41:45,151
I've never done a drug in my entire life.

1318
00:41:45,151 --> 00:41:47,831
Like, even the like,
my entire college crew

1319
00:41:47,831 --> 00:41:51,414
is all about smoking
14 blunts to the face.

1320
00:41:52,684 --> 00:41:53,847
- [Erin] My dad's like that.

1321
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:56,840
- I need to be in control, but
the one thing that gets me,

1322
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,787
I don't see it coming.

1323
00:41:58,787 --> 00:42:01,405
I, like, keep doing those
little fucking sake shots.

1324
00:42:01,405 --> 00:42:04,078
I never feel it, then all of a sudden,

1325
00:42:04,078 --> 00:42:06,401
I get into, like, my car to go home,

1326
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:07,805
and, like, the world, like,

1327
00:42:07,805 --> 00:42:09,377
New York City goes upside-down on me,

1328
00:42:09,377 --> 00:42:10,839
and I'm like, what the fuck?

1329
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:12,192
- [Mary Kate] So wine
doesn't get you drunk?

1330
00:42:12,192 --> 00:42:13,025
- I've never gotten,

1331
00:42:13,025 --> 00:42:14,906
I'm like never drunk.
- I think it's the size

1332
00:42:14,906 --> 00:42:16,760
of the glass, the sake glass.

1333
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,593
- It's tricking me.

1334
00:42:17,593 --> 00:42:18,765
Wine number four sniffy sniff.
- And you end up actually

1335
00:42:18,765 --> 00:42:20,283
drinking more, yeah.

1336
00:42:20,283 --> 00:42:21,705
Ooh, Andre's gonna like this.

1337
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,755
- [Andre] So, do you have a code word

1338
00:42:22,755 --> 00:42:24,770
- And the dinners are longer.
- for being hungover?

1339
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,750
At my house, so, we have three
little kids running around,

1340
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:30,083
so we always say, hey, are you dehydrated?

1341
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:33,251
That's our code word for being
hungover, amongst the adults.

1342
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:34,924
It's just more like, hey.

1343
00:42:34,924 --> 00:42:37,892
- [Mary Kate] There's nothing
worse in life, in life,

1344
00:42:37,892 --> 00:42:39,096
than being hungover--

1345
00:42:39,096 --> 00:42:40,389
- What about murder and rape?
- with a three-year-old.

1346
00:42:40,389 --> 00:42:41,660
Nope, nope.
- Okay.

1347
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,936
- [Mary Kate] Okay, well, Jesus, now--

1348
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:44,290
- Well I'm just asking, you just said

1349
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,404
there's nothing worse--
- The murder, I would say no,

1350
00:42:45,404 --> 00:42:46,605
but then the next, I mean--

1351
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,075
- So, wait, you're saying on the record,

1352
00:42:48,075 --> 00:42:51,065
'cause we'd like to use this
in like a piece of content,

1353
00:42:51,065 --> 00:42:53,681
that being hungover is worse than murder.

1354
00:42:53,681 --> 00:42:56,702
Can we put that as official
press release on PureWow?

1355
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:57,535
- [Mary Kate] Do it.

1356
00:42:57,535 --> 00:42:58,368
- Okay, good.

1357
00:42:58,368 --> 00:42:59,531
Erin, congratulations, you're the new,

1358
00:42:59,531 --> 00:43:01,715
sitting, editor in chief. (laughing)

1359
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:02,548
- The offer still stands.
- All right, what are we

1360
00:43:02,548 --> 00:43:04,836
getting on this nose?

1361
00:43:04,836 --> 00:43:05,808
This is smokey.
- Apples.

1362
00:43:05,808 --> 00:43:06,815
- Apples?

1363
00:43:06,815 --> 00:43:07,755
- Yeah apples fresh cut apples
- Oh gross, I don't like.

1364
00:43:07,755 --> 00:43:09,947
- You don't like this?
- I don't like it either.

1365
00:43:09,947 --> 00:43:11,218
- [Erin] No, it smells,
it smells like vom.

1366
00:43:11,218 --> 00:43:12,051
- I love this.
- It does smell. (laughing)

1367
00:43:12,051 --> 00:43:14,082
- I like it, it's just funky.
- I love it, I love it too.

1368
00:43:14,082 --> 00:43:15,127
- That's why I like it, yeah.
- Yeah, it's super funky.

1369
00:43:15,127 --> 00:43:17,215
- Trav, you love it, right?
- It smells like

1370
00:43:17,215 --> 00:43:18,048
stinky cheese.
- It's smokey.

1371
00:43:18,048 --> 00:43:19,335
- It's smokey.
- It smells like a pig farted.

1372
00:43:19,335 --> 00:43:20,680
- It has this fart

1373
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,525
smell to it.
- It smells like stinky,

1374
00:43:21,525 --> 00:43:22,358
moldy cheese.
- Yeah, yeah, it does.

1375
00:43:22,358 --> 00:43:23,751
- Smell it again, it is farty,

1376
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:25,047
it's very barnyard.
- It smells like a guy

1377
00:43:25,047 --> 00:43:26,463
I sat next to on the subway.
- Erin, you're super, like,

1378
00:43:26,463 --> 00:43:28,490
Chicago farm girl.

1379
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:30,628
- [Erin] Oh, no, no, I'm
just, like, you know.

1380
00:43:30,628 --> 00:43:32,609
- Like, this is like, you went to Iowa.

1381
00:43:32,609 --> 00:43:33,759
- [Erin] I'm not scared.

1382
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,866
- You're not, okay, I
understand you're not scared.

1383
00:43:35,866 --> 00:43:38,112
- [Andre] But no one wants
to drink a fart, though.

1384
00:43:38,112 --> 00:43:39,620
(laughing)

1385
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,989
- I prefer fart over fruit.

1386
00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:41,822
- [Mary Kate] This smells like

1387
00:43:41,822 --> 00:43:42,969
no air conditioning.
- Only in my wine.

1388
00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:44,182
- Yeah, only in my wine, but--

1389
00:43:44,182 --> 00:43:45,133
- [Erin] But guys, it's really wine?

1390
00:43:45,133 --> 00:43:46,727
Is this a joke?
- It's super earthy.

1391
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:49,740
No, this is super earthy and raw.

1392
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,573
Mary Kate?

1393
00:43:50,573 --> 00:43:51,929
- This smells like no air conditioning,

1394
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,933
New York City subway, next to, like,

1395
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:56,014
someone who might've just vommed.

1396
00:43:56,014 --> 00:43:58,114
- No, this is not BO, and everybody knows

1397
00:43:58,114 --> 00:43:59,472
what body odor smells like,

1398
00:43:59,472 --> 00:44:00,305
this is not BO.
- No body odor,

1399
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:01,138
no this is fart.

1400
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,598
This is different than--
- This is legit cow farm shit.

1401
00:44:03,598 --> 00:44:04,592
- Yeah, this is real.
- This is Iowa,

1402
00:44:04,592 --> 00:44:07,356
you've stepped into, like, a pig shit.

1403
00:44:07,356 --> 00:44:08,609
- Is that peat?
You've stepped into it,

1404
00:44:08,609 --> 00:44:10,328
you're trying to clean up your boot,

1405
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:12,222
and you smell the fart,
like, you smell ...

1406
00:44:12,222 --> 00:44:13,555
- It's more TOR.

1407
00:44:14,547 --> 00:44:16,768
- [Mary Kate] Can you,
Andre, can you clean up this,

1408
00:44:16,768 --> 00:44:17,601
like, I'm confused.
- But that's...

1409
00:44:17,601 --> 00:44:19,000
- [Gary] Taste it now, wait, taste it.

1410
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,833
This is where it gets interesting.

1411
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:21,081
Now taste it.
- It's great.

1412
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:23,972
- So, we farted in your
face, but now taste it.

1413
00:44:23,972 --> 00:44:24,985
- [Erin] I love you.

1414
00:44:24,985 --> 00:44:28,807
- That's the new name for
the podcast, by the way.

1415
00:44:28,807 --> 00:44:29,820
It comes after sloppy seconds.

1416
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,520
- [Erin] Okay, I get it
now, I get why you taste,

1417
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,918
you smell, and then you taste.

1418
00:44:32,918 --> 00:44:33,751
- Right?

1419
00:44:33,751 --> 00:44:34,584
- [Erin] That was a story.

1420
00:44:34,584 --> 00:44:38,120
- So, Erin, tell us the
story that you just consumed.

1421
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,350
- We got, we got farted, someone...

1422
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:43,710
We stepped in cow shit,
went to clean the boot,

1423
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:44,543
got farted on.

1424
00:44:44,543 --> 00:44:48,102
- [Gary] Yes, and then you
drank it, and what happened?

1425
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,779
- Then you got Febreze, man.

1426
00:44:49,779 --> 00:44:51,945
You got some, like--

1427
00:44:51,945 --> 00:44:52,778
- [Gary] You got the sour cherry?

1428
00:44:52,778 --> 00:44:55,379
- [Andre] Sour cherry but there's
some potpourri at the end.

1429
00:44:55,379 --> 00:44:56,859
- Yes, no, I was thinking
of, it was a lavender.

1430
00:44:56,859 --> 00:45:00,225
- [Andre] Someone sprayed in
the bathroom after they went.

1431
00:45:00,225 --> 00:45:02,657
- It's a cherry, it's
cherry, it's beautiful.

1432
00:45:02,657 --> 00:45:03,656
- I just want everybody to know,

1433
00:45:03,656 --> 00:45:06,164
we're on wine number four,
I spit the other three,

1434
00:45:06,164 --> 00:45:08,331
I'm already fully done
drinking this glass.

1435
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,373
- [Erin] This is amazing.

1436
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,206
- Do you love it?

1437
00:45:10,206 --> 00:45:11,039
- [Erin] Yeah.

1438
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,045
- It freaks you out that
it could smell like this,

1439
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:13,568
but taste like that.

1440
00:45:13,568 --> 00:45:15,057
Mary Kate?
- It's amazing.

1441
00:45:15,057 --> 00:45:15,890
- [Mary Kate] I really, this is like

1442
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,052
throwing my world a little bit.

1443
00:45:17,052 --> 00:45:18,959
- Did you have a boyfriend
that farted on you,

1444
00:45:18,959 --> 00:45:20,415
because he thought he
was like a fratty dude,

1445
00:45:20,415 --> 00:45:22,215
but you kind of were really
into it because he was hot?

1446
00:45:22,215 --> 00:45:23,064
That's what this wine is.

1447
00:45:23,064 --> 00:45:24,290
Farted, but it was delicious.

1448
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:25,123
- [Andre] Wow!

1449
00:45:25,123 --> 00:45:27,517
That was never my approach,
that was never my approach.

1450
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:28,744
- Well, that's because you and I

1451
00:45:28,744 --> 00:45:30,707
did not live the life of these two ladies.

1452
00:45:30,707 --> 00:45:32,118
That's why, I was trying to,

1453
00:45:32,118 --> 00:45:33,665
I'm trying to use my empathy here.

1454
00:45:33,665 --> 00:45:35,092
- I like guys that fart.
- Brown Bag episode

1455
00:45:35,092 --> 00:45:36,160
two is gonna be, like,

1456
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,444
Terry Gross and, like, the
most serious wine tasting

1457
00:45:39,444 --> 00:45:42,956
in the world, because this
has gone so off the rails!

1458
00:45:42,956 --> 00:45:44,496
- I'm gonna lose all my
subscriptions on this podcast.

1459
00:45:44,496 --> 00:45:47,422
This is the end of the
Gary V. Audio Experience,

1460
00:45:47,422 --> 00:45:48,800
and Wine Library, shut down.

1461
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,238
Andre, you've been growing
from zero to 40,000 cases.

1462
00:45:52,238 --> 00:45:53,904
You're going back to zero--
- I know absolutely

1463
00:45:53,904 --> 00:45:54,904
- After this podcast.

1464
00:45:54,904 --> 00:45:56,000
Andre, what do you think about this wine?

1465
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,034
- [Andre] I dig the wine.

1466
00:45:57,034 --> 00:46:01,264
I like that it's funky,
it's not cookie-cutter.

1467
00:46:01,264 --> 00:46:03,088
There is, like, this P-funk, sour cherry,

1468
00:46:03,088 --> 00:46:06,749
great acidity in the wine, not over-oaked.

1469
00:46:06,749 --> 00:46:07,593
- Not oaked at all.

1470
00:46:07,593 --> 00:46:10,799
- Yeah, so it just
feels, it feels natural.

1471
00:46:10,799 --> 00:46:12,212
- What kind of grape do you think this is?

1472
00:46:12,212 --> 00:46:13,406
I know we haven't gone there.
- Oh, shit.

1473
00:46:13,406 --> 00:46:14,716
- [Mary Kate] I wanna
know all of what we think.

1474
00:46:14,716 --> 00:46:15,748
- You know, I don't know, maybe...

1475
00:46:15,748 --> 00:46:16,581
- I'm struggling with it.
- Maybe from a cool

1476
00:46:16,581 --> 00:46:18,096
climate like cabernet franc,

1477
00:46:18,096 --> 00:46:19,392
or something like that.
- I'm struggling with it.

1478
00:46:19,392 --> 00:46:20,576
Trouty?

1479
00:46:20,576 --> 00:46:21,409
- [Trouty] I know what it is.

1480
00:46:21,409 --> 00:46:22,242
- Oh, you know, because you're out.

1481
00:46:22,242 --> 00:46:24,750
You know, I'm struggling
with it a little bit.

1482
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:28,659
The floral aspects of this
wine, are intriguing to me.

1483
00:46:28,659 --> 00:46:30,272
- Would a cabernet franc be floral?

1484
00:46:30,272 --> 00:46:31,105
- It could be.

1485
00:46:31,105 --> 00:46:32,712
- It could be more vegetal.
- I mean tangy veggie, yeah.

1486
00:46:32,712 --> 00:46:33,845
- Yeah, it's usually vegetables.

1487
00:46:33,845 --> 00:46:34,678
That's why I don't think--
- Yeah, and that's kind of

1488
00:46:34,678 --> 00:46:35,511
what I'm getting a little bit, too.

1489
00:46:35,511 --> 00:46:37,506
- But, to his point,
he's probably thinking,

1490
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:39,069
he definitely doesn't think,

1491
00:46:39,069 --> 00:46:41,665
excuse me, that this is
Loire Valley cab franc,

1492
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,676
but he could think it's
new world cab franc,

1493
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:45,224
if he's saying that, right?

1494
00:46:45,224 --> 00:46:49,430
So, like, go back,
actually, now I'm recalling

1495
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:50,761
because I'm ADDed out.

1496
00:46:50,761 --> 00:46:53,100
Domestic sparkling wine?

1497
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,135
What's happening?

1498
00:46:54,135 --> 00:46:54,968
You like that, D-Rock?

1499
00:46:54,968 --> 00:46:56,593
That was like 40 minutes ago.

1500
00:46:56,593 --> 00:46:57,976
- [Erin] Why is it, why?

1501
00:46:57,976 --> 00:46:58,809
- Why is that weird?

1502
00:46:58,809 --> 00:47:00,923
- That last interesting thing
was, like, 10 years ago,

1503
00:47:00,923 --> 00:47:02,777
when I was in it, like, Gruet, New Mexico,

1504
00:47:02,777 --> 00:47:04,030
but, like, what's
happening, what's happening?

1505
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,362
- [Andre] Yeah, so, but
now what you have is,

1506
00:47:05,362 --> 00:47:06,195
like now you get, like-

1507
00:47:06,195 --> 00:47:07,365
- Or is this your, are you nerd,

1508
00:47:07,365 --> 00:47:09,546
do you have a prop, are
you, is this your agenda?

1509
00:47:09,546 --> 00:47:10,379
- [Andre] No, no, no, no-no-no-no-no.

1510
00:47:10,379 --> 00:47:12,497
- I feel like you're doing
wine nerd agenda, okay.

1511
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:14,673
So, what has happened in
the last 24, 36 months

1512
00:47:14,673 --> 00:47:16,235
that's popped in the wine
world, sparkler-wise?

1513
00:47:16,235 --> 00:47:17,762
- What's happening now is, you have more,

1514
00:47:17,762 --> 00:47:19,123
mobile bottling lines?

1515
00:47:19,123 --> 00:47:22,153
That people are coming down
and helping with that process.

1516
00:47:22,153 --> 00:47:23,857
A good friend of mine just
started a company doing that,

1517
00:47:23,857 --> 00:47:26,110
but you just see it.

1518
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,311
No, I mean, you know-
- I'm sure, I know you.

1519
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:30,174
But what, has there been
a domestic sparkling wine

1520
00:47:30,174 --> 00:47:32,269
that's caught the attention
of the American consumer,

1521
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:33,102
recently?

1522
00:47:33,102 --> 00:47:35,285
- Well, but, see, I wouldn't say consumer.

1523
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:36,816
I'm on the, I'm on the gate-
- Nerd side.

1524
00:47:36,816 --> 00:47:38,439
- I'm on the gate, I'm
on the gatekeeper level,

1525
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:39,623
yeah, right, yeah.
- No, no, Nate, nerd side.

1526
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:40,456
- Ha, yeah.

1527
00:47:40,456 --> 00:47:42,411
- Okay, what's caught
the nerd's attention?

1528
00:47:42,411 --> 00:47:43,688
- Absolutely, which means-
- What?

1529
00:47:43,688 --> 00:47:44,755
- It's, which is sparkling.

1530
00:47:44,755 --> 00:47:45,832
- Who, in the US?

1531
00:47:45,832 --> 00:47:46,939
- Oh, um...

1532
00:47:46,939 --> 00:47:48,396
- That freaked me out.

1533
00:47:48,396 --> 00:47:49,437
- Shit, man.
- Anybody?

1534
00:47:49,437 --> 00:47:50,270
- I'm at a loss for words.

1535
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,572
- Yeah, I fucking got you, motherfucker.

1536
00:47:52,572 --> 00:47:56,200
I think people get bored
and they wanna pioneer.

1537
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,858
- Give it to me before you
leave, because I'm curious.

1538
00:47:57,858 --> 00:47:58,780
- [Andre] No, dude,
everyone, like, I mean,

1539
00:47:58,780 --> 00:47:59,828
that's what people are-
- Well, actually, Andre,

1540
00:47:59,828 --> 00:48:01,982
I'm sorry, because I'm being selfish now.

1541
00:48:01,982 --> 00:48:02,815
- [Andre] Go ahead.

1542
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,501
- What's happening in the
wine scene in New York,

1543
00:48:04,501 --> 00:48:07,352
supplier-wise, restaurateur-wise,

1544
00:48:07,352 --> 00:48:08,964
who's the hottest sommelier
in New York right now?

1545
00:48:08,964 --> 00:48:09,797
- [Andre] I don't know.

1546
00:48:09,797 --> 00:48:10,822
- You're out of that game too?

1547
00:48:10,822 --> 00:48:11,759
- [Andre] Well, the fact of it is,

1548
00:48:11,759 --> 00:48:13,681
is that I'm only here for the weekends.

1549
00:48:13,681 --> 00:48:14,535
- Oh my god, there's more?

1550
00:48:14,535 --> 00:48:15,464
I can't.

1551
00:48:15,464 --> 00:48:17,068
- [Gary] So is there,
well, okay, but you...

1552
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:18,057
- [Andre] So, like, who's killing it,

1553
00:48:18,057 --> 00:48:19,391
I think, you know-
- You're smart, come on.

1554
00:48:19,391 --> 00:48:21,624
- I think that, like, you know,

1555
00:48:21,624 --> 00:48:24,635
a lot of sommeliers are
coming into their own.

1556
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,104
I think sommeliers are
more entrepreneurial

1557
00:48:26,104 --> 00:48:27,722
than they ever have been in the past.

1558
00:48:27,722 --> 00:48:29,192
And I think, and I totally agree with you,

1559
00:48:29,192 --> 00:48:30,784
I think that, like, just more people

1560
00:48:30,784 --> 00:48:34,583
are more entrepreneurial overall, right?

1561
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:37,022
- So I must still be like this.

1562
00:48:37,022 --> 00:48:37,855
- Dude, you ...

1563
00:48:37,855 --> 00:48:39,283
- I need to re-enter,
this is, you know what?

1564
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:40,707
This is fun that I'm doing this.

1565
00:48:40,707 --> 00:48:44,307
I need to re-enter the
game, because the truth is,

1566
00:48:44,307 --> 00:48:46,579
like, when I did Wine Library TV,

1567
00:48:46,579 --> 00:48:48,559
people thought I was
a douche bag at first.

1568
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:49,642
- [Erin] Why?

1569
00:48:50,717 --> 00:48:51,943
- Because it was so different,

1570
00:48:51,943 --> 00:48:53,907
because I'm a little bit aggressive.

1571
00:48:53,907 --> 00:48:55,988
Like, I don't know, Andre,
this is actually a good segway.

1572
00:48:55,988 --> 00:48:58,386
What was happening when-
- The show wasn't for them,

1573
00:48:58,386 --> 00:48:59,808
and that everybody thought it was for you,

1574
00:48:59,808 --> 00:49:02,375
and the thing of it is, is that,
and I actually tell people,

1575
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:03,851
granted, there's gonna be some kid

1576
00:49:03,851 --> 00:49:05,340
that's gonna come work for you,

1577
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,371
that got into wine from
watching this guy's show.

1578
00:49:07,371 --> 00:49:09,440
It's just not for, it's like,

1579
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,911
you can watch it for entertainment value,

1580
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,040
but, like, for everybody, it's like,

1581
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,102
"Oh, he's like jammin' wine,"

1582
00:49:13,102 --> 00:49:14,465
"he's talking about wine this way."

1583
00:49:14,465 --> 00:49:16,264
But all the younger kids are gonna come,

1584
00:49:16,264 --> 00:49:18,655
and there's people here,
now, in New York City

1585
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:20,231
who are running wine programs,

1586
00:49:20,231 --> 00:49:22,303
that got into wine from watching his show.

1587
00:49:22,303 --> 00:49:24,923
And like, and people gotten all in a huff

1588
00:49:24,923 --> 00:49:27,015
and a fuss about it, but-
- This was 2007.

1589
00:49:27,015 --> 00:49:27,848
First of all--
- Oh, that could make sense

1590
00:49:27,848 --> 00:49:29,871
because before--
- It was 2007.

1591
00:49:29,871 --> 00:49:31,072
It was 10 years ago.

1592
00:49:31,072 --> 00:49:32,509
- That's before I was introduced.

1593
00:49:32,509 --> 00:49:34,330
That's, like, the year that, you know,

1594
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:36,701
I was started, like,
moved to New York City

1595
00:49:36,701 --> 00:49:39,229
and, you know, it's like the art world.

1596
00:49:39,229 --> 00:49:42,219
It feels uninviting, it
makes you feel stupid.

1597
00:49:42,219 --> 00:49:43,488
Which is, like, I mean, I feel,

1598
00:49:43,488 --> 00:49:45,637
I'll be honest, I feel stupid today.

1599
00:49:45,637 --> 00:49:48,670
But, that's what even still,
I've been drinking wine,

1600
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:51,130
and I now, I know my way around wine,

1601
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:52,595
I know my favorites, I know, like...

1602
00:49:52,595 --> 00:49:54,177
- [Gary] What is your favorite?

1603
00:49:54,177 --> 00:49:56,628
- I mean, I'm...
- Don't feel, like, own it.

1604
00:49:56,628 --> 00:50:00,487
- Oh, I'm own, I just, I'm
like four deep right now

1605
00:50:00,487 --> 00:50:01,816
(laughs) in these wines.

1606
00:50:01,816 --> 00:50:02,944
I'm like, gimme a second.

1607
00:50:02,944 --> 00:50:04,099
- We are on wine number five.

1608
00:50:04,099 --> 00:50:06,160
What are your favorites, though?

1609
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,127
- Are we talking about
wines or her ex-boyfriends?

1610
00:50:08,127 --> 00:50:09,296
- Both.

1611
00:50:09,296 --> 00:50:10,129
- (hiss)

1612
00:50:10,129 --> 00:50:11,326
- [Gary] Favorite boyfriends,
let's actually switch it up.

1613
00:50:11,326 --> 00:50:13,477
- No, no, no, I mean,
that's like a nightmare.

1614
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:14,652
They're like The Village People.

1615
00:50:14,652 --> 00:50:17,886
(all laughing)

1616
00:50:17,886 --> 00:50:19,102
- Alright, favorite wines.

1617
00:50:19,102 --> 00:50:21,153
- I love natural wines.

1618
00:50:21,153 --> 00:50:21,986
- [Gary] You do.

1619
00:50:21,986 --> 00:50:25,798
- I love that cloudy, unpredictable...

1620
00:50:25,798 --> 00:50:28,569
I like the story, like if I was a wine,

1621
00:50:28,569 --> 00:50:31,557
I'd be, I would be a natural wine.

1622
00:50:31,557 --> 00:50:33,525
- Oh, new question: if you
were a wine, what would you be?

1623
00:50:33,525 --> 00:50:35,841
- [Gary] Mary Kate,
favorite wine, right now.

1624
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:36,674
Or recently.

1625
00:50:36,674 --> 00:50:39,636
- Rosé in a can, and then after that?

1626
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:43,277
A chilled, very cold rosé, I'm kidding.

1627
00:50:43,277 --> 00:50:44,419
- [Gary] You're not a
big wine person, right?

1628
00:50:44,419 --> 00:50:45,423
- No, I'm a huge wine person.

1629
00:50:45,423 --> 00:50:47,045
How about, like, a petite Syrah.

1630
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:49,024
- Petite Syrah, very cool.

1631
00:50:49,024 --> 00:50:50,783
- [Mary Kate] Something I
can drink at home by myself.

1632
00:50:50,783 --> 00:50:52,066
- [Erin] I love Syrah!

1633
00:50:52,066 --> 00:50:52,899
- [Andre] She's on another level (laughs)

1634
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:54,010
- [Gary] You should be Syrah sisters!

1635
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,423
- [Erin] I agree with you.

1636
00:50:55,423 --> 00:50:56,810
- I love that the most.

1637
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:57,643
- [Erin] I just discovered it...

1638
00:50:57,643 --> 00:50:58,857
- [Mary Kate] And we're
gonna leave right from here

1639
00:50:58,857 --> 00:51:01,154
and get tattoos that say "Syrah Sisters"

1640
00:51:01,154 --> 00:51:02,031
and we'll never regret them.

1641
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:04,165
- [Gary] It's still 11:29 AM.

1642
00:51:04,165 --> 00:51:05,250
All right, let's sniffy sniff here.

1643
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:06,083
- I'm so drunk.

1644
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:07,356
- Wait, no, what's your ...
- I'll tell you in a second.

1645
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:08,721
- Yeah, what are you?
- I'll tell you in a second.

1646
00:51:08,721 --> 00:51:11,766
I have been really into Nebbiolo.

1647
00:51:11,766 --> 00:51:14,236
I'm drinking a ton of Barolo, like,

1648
00:51:14,236 --> 00:51:17,736
I had a 90, last night, I had a 96 Vietti,

1649
00:51:19,158 --> 00:51:20,814
single vineyard Barolo.

1650
00:51:20,814 --> 00:51:25,583
I think Barolo is so underpriced,
for what it delivers.

1651
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:28,834
Burgundy, seven-
- What does it deliver?

1652
00:51:28,834 --> 00:51:31,044
- When I use that, I use
it as a slang term for,

1653
00:51:31,044 --> 00:51:33,873
what is the quality of that wine,

1654
00:51:33,873 --> 00:51:35,113
in comparison to all the
other wines in the world...

1655
00:51:35,113 --> 00:51:36,982
- What are you tasting
when you say quality?

1656
00:51:36,982 --> 00:51:39,642
That's what people get,
that's where people lose you.

1657
00:51:39,642 --> 00:51:40,745
Because I don't know what you mean.

1658
00:51:40,745 --> 00:51:41,879
I wanna know what you mean,

1659
00:51:41,879 --> 00:51:42,712
because you know what
you're talking about.

1660
00:51:42,712 --> 00:51:44,318
- Every single person
that's thinking right now,

1661
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:46,882
think about the thing
that you consume the most.

1662
00:51:46,882 --> 00:51:51,049
Soda, hamburgers, bourbon, candy...

1663
00:51:52,751 --> 00:51:53,584
- Chewing gum.

1664
00:51:53,584 --> 00:51:55,301
- Like, for example, cola, right?

1665
00:51:55,301 --> 00:51:57,507
For everybody 40 and older,
when we used to drink cola,

1666
00:51:57,507 --> 00:51:58,568
now all you kids drink water

1667
00:51:58,568 --> 00:52:00,379
because you're healthy as
shit and you all look great.

1668
00:52:00,379 --> 00:52:02,488
Especially with filters
and angles on Instagram.

1669
00:52:02,488 --> 00:52:06,691
So, when we drank cola,
it's so easy for me

1670
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:09,807
to taste the difference
between Coca-Cola, Pepsi,

1671
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:14,108
RC Cola, and cola that's
private label, ShopRite shit.

1672
00:52:14,108 --> 00:52:15,658
Right?

1673
00:52:15,658 --> 00:52:18,293
It's because I drank so much of it.

1674
00:52:18,293 --> 00:52:20,955
Like, cupcakes, I like them a lot.

1675
00:52:20,955 --> 00:52:23,318
So it's super easy for me to be like,

1676
00:52:23,318 --> 00:52:26,386
"oh, this is the good cupcake,
this is a shit cupcake."

1677
00:52:26,386 --> 00:52:28,507
But if it's the first
cupcake you ever had,

1678
00:52:28,507 --> 00:52:30,194
you don't have context.

1679
00:52:30,194 --> 00:52:31,817
So everybody right now,
while you're listening,

1680
00:52:31,817 --> 00:52:32,972
close your eyes and think about

1681
00:52:32,972 --> 00:52:34,612
the thing you consume the most,

1682
00:52:34,612 --> 00:52:38,353
and now tell me, in
that category of thing,

1683
00:52:38,353 --> 00:52:40,130
do you feel like you understand

1684
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:42,391
what is good and what is
not, the answer is yes.

1685
00:52:42,391 --> 00:52:45,994
You have a very good sense that
this piece of pizza's good,

1686
00:52:45,994 --> 00:52:48,346
and this is not, this is, this isn't.

1687
00:52:48,346 --> 00:52:50,170
That's how I think about wine.

1688
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:53,663
I consumed so much that
I have so much context

1689
00:52:53,663 --> 00:52:56,353
that for my own palate, and
I'm confident in my own self,

1690
00:52:56,353 --> 00:52:58,159
this is good wine, this is not good wine.

1691
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:01,075
To me, Barolo is super interesting

1692
00:53:01,075 --> 00:53:03,890
because it has the nuances
and characteristics

1693
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:07,893
and complexity of pinot
noir and burgundies,

1694
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:10,757
but it has the fruit and the power

1695
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:12,669
of the things that I like about Cabernets

1696
00:53:12,669 --> 00:53:13,654
and other varietals.

1697
00:53:13,654 --> 00:53:15,624
I think it's the perfect middle,

1698
00:53:15,624 --> 00:53:18,363
and because the wine critics don't carry

1699
00:53:18,363 --> 00:53:20,614
as much weight anymore, nobody's able

1700
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:23,409
to make Barolo super overpriced

1701
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,450
by giving everything a hundred points

1702
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:26,684
like used to be able to.

1703
00:53:26,684 --> 00:53:29,620
And so I think Barolo has
found this really sweet spot

1704
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:32,211
where it's not being
auctioned off in Hong Kong

1705
00:53:32,211 --> 00:53:33,273
and these things.

1706
00:53:33,273 --> 00:53:35,136
I think it is the perfect wine right now

1707
00:53:35,136 --> 00:53:38,659
where if you buy an $80 Barolo
from a really good producer,

1708
00:53:38,659 --> 00:53:42,724
I believe you're buying a
$400 Burgundy, Bordeaux,

1709
00:53:42,724 --> 00:53:45,537
or cult California wine,
and that's why I love it.

1710
00:53:45,537 --> 00:53:46,899
- [Erin] Well, you heard it here.

1711
00:53:46,899 --> 00:53:47,732
- [Andre] There you go.

1712
00:53:47,732 --> 00:53:48,565
- [Gary] That was good.

1713
00:53:48,565 --> 00:53:49,398
- [Mary Kate] That was fantastic.

1714
00:53:49,398 --> 00:53:52,436
- That reminded of some of the OGs.

1715
00:53:52,436 --> 00:53:53,269
You like that, right?

1716
00:53:53,269 --> 00:53:54,394
Seth, you were super impressed,

1717
00:53:54,394 --> 00:53:56,833
Seth, you were looking at me
in a totally different way.

1718
00:53:56,833 --> 00:54:00,163
You're like, 'wait, he
knows other things too!'

1719
00:54:00,163 --> 00:54:01,682
That's what's happening
with you right now.

1720
00:54:01,682 --> 00:54:02,557
Iris?

1721
00:54:02,557 --> 00:54:03,390
- [Iris] Yeah?

1722
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:05,048
- Okay, good.

1723
00:54:05,048 --> 00:54:06,547
Good, all right, let's
get into wine number five.

1724
00:54:06,547 --> 00:54:07,380
Let's sniffy sniff.

1725
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,996
- Seth soon will be like the bartender.

1726
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:11,122
- [Gary] He really looks
like the Andy Cohen,

1727
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:13,339
Seth, take your shirt off.

1728
00:54:13,339 --> 00:54:14,397
No, Seth, really, take your shirt off.

1729
00:54:14,397 --> 00:54:16,035
- [Erin] We have a sound mixer in here.

1730
00:54:16,035 --> 00:54:16,868
I don't know if it's ...

1731
00:54:16,868 --> 00:54:18,957
- [Gary] Seth is cute, actually.

1732
00:54:18,957 --> 00:54:19,790
- [Erin] I might have
a little crush on Seth.

1733
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:20,623
- Erin, you like Seth?

1734
00:54:20,623 --> 00:54:21,456
- [Erin] Yes.

1735
00:54:21,456 --> 00:54:22,550
- [Gary] Dude, a supermodel
just said you're cute.

1736
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,580
This is the greatest
day of your life, Seth.

1737
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:25,753
I'll be very honest with you.

1738
00:54:25,753 --> 00:54:26,834
I don't know enough about your life,

1739
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:27,725
but I'm gonna save you time.

1740
00:54:27,725 --> 00:54:29,927
This is the best fucking day of your life.

1741
00:54:29,927 --> 00:54:32,587
Go find one of Erin's
ridiculously hot pictures

1742
00:54:32,587 --> 00:54:34,889
on Google, take a screenshot,
text your buddies,

1743
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:36,536
and be like, 'dude, go to 54 minutes'

1744
00:54:36,536 --> 00:54:39,054
'into podcast number one
of Brown Paper Bags.'

1745
00:54:39,054 --> 00:54:41,265
Like, this is the great
moment of your life.

1746
00:54:41,265 --> 00:54:42,537
- [Mary Kate] This might
get cut, though Seth,

1747
00:54:42,537 --> 00:54:45,107
so, just keep it for yourself. (laughs)

1748
00:54:45,107 --> 00:54:46,795
- No, no, we don't edit.

1749
00:54:46,795 --> 00:54:48,835
You don't understand, do
you understand anything?

1750
00:54:48,835 --> 00:54:50,862
- Pretty much, no.

1751
00:54:50,862 --> 00:54:52,397
- [Erin] Gary, I think
about that all the time.

1752
00:54:52,397 --> 00:54:55,896
When I, like, literally every day,

1753
00:54:55,896 --> 00:54:57,022
this not editing thing that you do...

1754
00:54:57,022 --> 00:54:58,021
- I don't edit shit.

1755
00:54:58,021 --> 00:55:00,229
- [Erin] Because you,
something about who you are,

1756
00:55:00,229 --> 00:55:02,485
it makes me sit and question, like,

1757
00:55:02,485 --> 00:55:04,724
how come I'm not that, like, how come,

1758
00:55:04,724 --> 00:55:07,554
why am I with, like, because
that's a power, you know?

1759
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,720
- Honestly, that's the reason
I became so attracted to you.

1760
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,476
I think for, especially in your world,

1761
00:55:11,476 --> 00:55:14,059
I think you are super unedited.

1762
00:55:14,987 --> 00:55:17,162
- Oh, really?
- By comparison to your craft

1763
00:55:17,162 --> 00:55:18,385
and the other individuals in your world?

1764
00:55:18,385 --> 00:55:19,552
- [Andre] They would probably never say

1765
00:55:19,552 --> 00:55:21,290
they eat Dunkin' Donuts, right?

1766
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:22,497
- [Gary] Oh, it's so intense.

1767
00:55:22,497 --> 00:55:23,551
Like, Erin's a real person.
- Oh really?

1768
00:55:23,551 --> 00:55:24,384
I don't know how to be different.

1769
00:55:24,384 --> 00:55:25,651
- [Gary] You know everything,
you're a real person.

1770
00:55:25,651 --> 00:55:27,059
- Oh, I am, yeah.

1771
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:27,980
I'm a real boy!

1772
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,651
(all laughing)

1773
00:55:29,651 --> 00:55:31,191
I just don't know how to be different,

1774
00:55:31,191 --> 00:55:33,907
but I get very, I'm shy, so it's like I...

1775
00:55:33,907 --> 00:55:37,367
Like, if I'm told to, even for
work, take a video of myself,

1776
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:39,986
and post on Instagram,
like, that's gonna, I can't.

1777
00:55:39,986 --> 00:55:40,819
- Erin, are you, you know,

1778
00:55:40,819 --> 00:55:42,634
let's talk about that for a
minute, because obviously,

1779
00:55:42,634 --> 00:55:45,017
we're reminded of, like, the
people that listen to this,

1780
00:55:45,017 --> 00:55:46,147
it's not about wine.

1781
00:55:46,147 --> 00:55:47,442
A lot of them are...
- It's about getting us drunk.

1782
00:55:47,442 --> 00:55:48,957
- Social brand, entrepreneur, dot dot...

1783
00:55:48,957 --> 00:55:49,790
- And then talking.

1784
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:50,659
- Are you in your zone the most

1785
00:55:50,659 --> 00:55:51,980
when you're being photographed?

1786
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:55,790
Like, are you, like, that
is a strength of yours.

1787
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:57,958
Like, you couldn't have
had the career you've had.

1788
00:55:57,958 --> 00:55:58,791
- Back to sports.

1789
00:55:58,791 --> 00:56:00,795
- When you're shy, I
know you a little bit,

1790
00:56:00,795 --> 00:56:02,685
so like, when you're shy in
real life, this and that,

1791
00:56:02,685 --> 00:56:03,897
but when it's game time, right?

1792
00:56:03,897 --> 00:56:05,193
Like, when you're in a Victoria,

1793
00:56:05,193 --> 00:56:07,977
like, you're shy, yet, Victoria's Secret,

1794
00:56:07,977 --> 00:56:10,226
like, outfits, are not shy type stuff.

1795
00:56:10,226 --> 00:56:12,182
When the camera, when D-Rock comes around

1796
00:56:12,182 --> 00:56:13,745
and you see that camera ...
- I'm a killer.

1797
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:14,578
- Yeah.
- I know that.

1798
00:56:14,578 --> 00:56:15,553
- That's fucking interesting.

1799
00:56:15,553 --> 00:56:17,220
- But that's sports.

1800
00:56:18,691 --> 00:56:21,250
Like in the parameters of
the rules, what you're doing,

1801
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:23,285
if you put me in a space,
I don't see anyone.

1802
00:56:23,285 --> 00:56:25,835
I can just move, it's like some people,

1803
00:56:25,835 --> 00:56:27,832
it's also jazz musicians
I think have this,

1804
00:56:27,832 --> 00:56:31,436
like, I was watching, I'm
cake guys, it's the wine, but,

1805
00:56:31,436 --> 00:56:33,091
if you get back to the point, it's like,

1806
00:56:33,091 --> 00:56:35,036
some people have their creative outlet

1807
00:56:35,036 --> 00:56:37,599
is their physical person
in time and space,

1808
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:41,766
and it's kind of, you can,
I can just feel my body.

1809
00:56:42,831 --> 00:56:45,872
Like, whenever I played,
whenever I was practicing,

1810
00:56:45,872 --> 00:56:49,930
if a coach told me what
I did wrong with my shot,

1811
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:52,874
I could, every time, I
could immediately change it,

1812
00:56:52,874 --> 00:56:54,489
with him just telling me.

1813
00:56:54,489 --> 00:56:56,224
- Because you're attached to your body.

1814
00:56:56,224 --> 00:56:57,816
- [Erin] Yeah, something, it's kinetic.

1815
00:56:57,816 --> 00:57:01,999
And so, that happens when I'm not involved

1816
00:57:01,999 --> 00:57:04,132
with, like, I'm just doing my thing.

1817
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:07,167
But then you make it, I don't know.

1818
00:57:07,167 --> 00:57:08,983
I don't wanna film myself.

1819
00:57:08,983 --> 00:57:09,816
- I understand.

1820
00:57:09,816 --> 00:57:10,649
- You know, it's a
completely different thing--

1821
00:57:10,649 --> 00:57:14,133
- Andre, where's your,
like, if that's it for Erin,

1822
00:57:14,133 --> 00:57:17,035
like, that zone, what is your number,

1823
00:57:17,035 --> 00:57:19,471
your an entrepreneur, you've
built this real business.

1824
00:57:19,471 --> 00:57:22,487
You've been a sommelier at
the high pressure cooker

1825
00:57:22,487 --> 00:57:24,449
of Thomas Keller
restaurants, but if you took,

1826
00:57:24,449 --> 00:57:26,913
you're a dad of three, like, in full life,

1827
00:57:26,913 --> 00:57:28,413
where's your zone?

1828
00:57:31,441 --> 00:57:34,469
- I think just in the
moment, with other people.

1829
00:57:34,469 --> 00:57:36,624
I think this is still a people business

1830
00:57:36,624 --> 00:57:38,610
and that's why I get
on the plane every week

1831
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:40,291
to go to a place to meet these people.

1832
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:41,927
Not so they can say that they know me,

1833
00:57:41,927 --> 00:57:43,874
but more so I can say that I know them

1834
00:57:43,874 --> 00:57:48,281
and I think, no one wants to
do business with an asshole.

1835
00:57:48,281 --> 00:57:50,250
You generally wanna like those people,

1836
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:52,655
and people give you money or invest in you

1837
00:57:52,655 --> 00:57:54,475
or do different things because
they like you as a person.

1838
00:57:54,475 --> 00:57:56,048
- [Gary] So your warm
heart charisma, kindness...

1839
00:57:56,048 --> 00:57:57,350
- Yeah, I'm out on the front lines.

1840
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:58,183
- [Gary] You feel that's
been your offense.

1841
00:57:58,183 --> 00:57:59,342
- Yeah, I think so.
- You feel like you've been

1842
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:00,175
able to build a real brand.
- Yeah, I can walk into

1843
00:58:00,175 --> 00:58:02,968
a room and start talking
to people right away...

1844
00:58:02,968 --> 00:58:04,458
and that wasn't always a strong suit.

1845
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:05,727
- You developed it.
- I mean, I had to

1846
00:58:05,727 --> 00:58:07,741
figure that shit out, right?

1847
00:58:07,741 --> 00:58:08,727
- [Gary] Mary Kate?

1848
00:58:08,727 --> 00:58:12,141
- Story, like, I get, I get story.

1849
00:58:12,141 --> 00:58:13,066
- [Gary] You see
something and you're like,

1850
00:58:13,066 --> 00:58:13,996
'oh, that's a story.'

1851
00:58:13,996 --> 00:58:16,576
You look at Seth's face, and you're like,

1852
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:17,422
you can figure out the story.

1853
00:58:17,422 --> 00:58:18,860
- I have an entire...
- So let's work with Seth.

1854
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,238
What is the story with Seth?

1855
00:58:20,238 --> 00:58:21,071
- Ready?

1856
00:58:21,071 --> 00:58:21,904
I won't even look at Seth.

1857
00:58:21,904 --> 00:58:24,796
- [Gary] Oh, you're not
even, you're like a gangster.

1858
00:58:24,796 --> 00:58:25,629
Guys, I know you're listening.

1859
00:58:25,629 --> 00:58:26,503
Mary Kate is a gangster.

1860
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:27,766
She's not even looking at Seth.

1861
00:58:27,766 --> 00:58:28,599
- [Erin] She's such a gangster.

1862
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:30,233
- Let me tell you a couple
things that are happening.

1863
00:58:30,233 --> 00:58:31,614
She's not looking at Seth.

1864
00:58:31,614 --> 00:58:34,107
Seth is fairly red at this point.

1865
00:58:34,107 --> 00:58:36,304
So let's just keep this
going, go ahead Mary Kate.

1866
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:37,137
- Okay.

1867
00:58:37,137 --> 00:58:40,862
I would know Seth's entire
history within five minutes.

1868
00:58:40,862 --> 00:58:42,195
I'm not kidding.

1869
00:58:43,941 --> 00:58:45,009
My husband always says, he's like,

1870
00:58:45,009 --> 00:58:47,580
"You flirt with the world
because you ask everyone"

1871
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:50,019
"a thousand questions."
- You are very flirty.

1872
00:58:50,019 --> 00:58:51,728
Erin, do you feel her flirtiness?

1873
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,588
- Mary Kate is one of a kind, seriously.

1874
00:58:53,588 --> 00:58:54,421
But no, yes.

1875
00:58:54,421 --> 00:58:55,254
- [Gary] You guys hung out in the Hamps,

1876
00:58:55,254 --> 00:58:56,774
throwing a peel-out party.

1877
00:58:56,774 --> 00:58:58,928
What have you, what happened there?

1878
00:58:58,928 --> 00:58:59,987
- Mary Kate is awesome.
- Did you flirt

1879
00:58:59,987 --> 00:59:00,820
with Mary Kate?

1880
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,141
- Yeah.
- I love people,

1881
00:59:03,141 --> 00:59:03,974
yes, I love people so much.
- Did I?

1882
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:05,349
- I love people so much.

1883
00:59:05,349 --> 00:59:06,800
- Yes you do.
- Yes, full-body hugs.

1884
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,633
- It's part of the charm then, flirting.

1885
00:59:07,633 --> 00:59:10,050
- I love people so much,
and I love their stories.

1886
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:13,647
and I can do it from a business end,

1887
00:59:13,647 --> 00:59:15,568
so I can look at a proposal and be like,

1888
00:59:15,568 --> 00:59:17,268
you lost the narrative here...

1889
00:59:17,268 --> 00:59:18,999
- You know, I've been
very impressed with you.

1890
00:59:18,999 --> 00:59:20,953
I thought, when I bought PureWow,

1891
00:59:20,953 --> 00:59:22,496
that I would fire you pretty quickly.

1892
00:59:22,496 --> 00:59:23,329
- [Mary Kate] Same.

1893
00:59:23,329 --> 00:59:24,830
- Yeah, you thought you'd quit, I mean.

1894
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:26,478
- [Mary Kate] I actually have another job.

1895
00:59:26,478 --> 00:59:28,561
It's on the water market.

1896
00:59:29,613 --> 00:59:30,810
Do you know The Dodo?

1897
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:32,598
- (laughing)

1898
00:59:32,598 --> 00:59:34,469
When's the first time we met, Mary Kate?

1899
00:59:34,469 --> 00:59:35,469
Do you know?

1900
00:59:36,733 --> 00:59:38,980
- Maybe in Austin?

1901
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,816
Not in New York.

1902
00:59:40,816 --> 00:59:42,879
- [Gary] In either
Cannes or Austin, right?

1903
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:43,712
Maybe three years ago?

1904
00:59:43,712 --> 00:59:44,910
- And Cannes was the
first when we went like,

1905
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:46,437
knee-to-knee, like--
- We hang out last.

1906
00:59:46,437 --> 00:59:47,270
- [Gary] What was funny is--

1907
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:49,460
- No, because it was--
- Two Cannes ago,

1908
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,501
when I already was negotiating,

1909
00:59:50,501 --> 00:59:51,739
did you, you didn't know yet, did you?

1910
00:59:51,739 --> 00:59:53,329
- No.
- Two Cannes ago?

1911
00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:55,044
- Three Cannes ago, we hung out.

1912
00:59:55,044 --> 00:59:57,377
Two ago, Ryan told me, and--

1913
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,808
- [Gary] This one we were
together, as a team, dominating.

1914
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:04,602
Okay, your superpower, the story.

1915
01:00:04,602 --> 01:00:05,583
- The story, I just--

1916
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:06,845
- [Erin] I wanna know what that means.

1917
01:00:06,845 --> 01:00:09,768
How did you guys both
know what that means?

1918
01:00:09,768 --> 01:00:10,917
What's your superstory?

1919
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:12,263
that's like, a noun.

1920
01:00:12,263 --> 01:00:15,377
- Because, I know, but I
just, I love, I love...

1921
01:00:15,377 --> 01:00:16,210
- [Gary] Is story a noun?

1922
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:17,043
I'm terrible with grammar.

1923
01:00:17,043 --> 01:00:20,599
- I'm skilled, but my skillset
is like, telling narrative.

1924
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:21,975
- [Gary] By the way, I'm
sorry to interrupt you

1925
01:00:21,975 --> 01:00:23,143
because I like to do that.

1926
01:00:23,143 --> 01:00:24,259
For everybody who's listening right now,

1927
01:00:24,259 --> 01:00:25,921
for future Brown Bag episodes,

1928
01:00:25,921 --> 01:00:28,848
I highly recommend fast-forwarding
the first 45 minutes,

1929
01:00:28,848 --> 01:00:31,621
because the back end, the fourth quarter,

1930
01:00:31,621 --> 01:00:34,503
is where all the shit gets good.

1931
01:00:34,503 --> 01:00:36,170
Go ahead, Mary Kate.

1932
01:00:37,568 --> 01:00:40,093
- My dad was a longtime ad guy,

1933
01:00:40,093 --> 01:00:44,744
and I remember, like, forever,

1934
01:00:44,744 --> 01:00:48,117
being, like, entranced with commercials

1935
01:00:48,117 --> 01:00:50,060
in 30 seconds telling this, like,

1936
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:54,039
emotional tie of a story,
and at the same time,

1937
01:00:54,039 --> 01:00:57,183
I was the biggest reader,
and I remember staying in bed

1938
01:00:57,183 --> 01:00:59,202
on Saturday mornings when,
like, all my brothers,

1939
01:00:59,202 --> 01:01:01,892
I'm the youngest kid, all
my brothers would be, like,

1940
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:03,865
the house would be like, vibrating.

1941
01:01:03,865 --> 01:01:06,429
I'm the only girl, four boys.
- That's like my mom.

1942
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:08,019
- That's the narrative.
- She was a reader, too.

1943
01:01:08,019 --> 01:01:09,985
- And I would stay in bed and just, like,

1944
01:01:09,985 --> 01:01:13,595
pummel through books,
like, chuck 'em aside.

1945
01:01:13,595 --> 01:01:17,095
And, I just, like, Seth's story, like,

1946
01:01:17,095 --> 01:01:19,074
I'd start at his, like, his tats,

1947
01:01:19,074 --> 01:01:21,110
like, what those numbers mean,

1948
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,219
and I would then-
- What do they mean, Seth?

1949
01:01:23,219 --> 01:01:24,413
Shh, Mary Kate.

1950
01:01:24,413 --> 01:01:25,246
- [Seth] It's the add of the house

1951
01:01:25,246 --> 01:01:26,581
that both me and my father grew up in,

1952
01:01:26,581 --> 01:01:28,521
in Bayside, in Queens.

1953
01:01:28,521 --> 01:01:30,035
- [Gary] Yeah, I already
like Seth already.

1954
01:01:30,035 --> 01:01:32,805
- And then I would say,
like, who in your family...

1955
01:01:32,805 --> 01:01:33,638
- [Gary] Seth, this is gonna be

1956
01:01:33,638 --> 01:01:34,471
the greatest day of your life.

1957
01:01:34,471 --> 01:01:37,199
- Seth, Seth, who in your, did your,

1958
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:39,141
are you close to your mom?

1959
01:01:39,141 --> 01:01:40,766
- [Seth] Closer with my mom than my dad.

1960
01:01:40,766 --> 01:01:43,242
- Okay, did she like that
you got those tattoos?

1961
01:01:43,242 --> 01:01:44,423
- [Seth] Didn't mind them.

1962
01:01:44,423 --> 01:01:45,821
- Why, does she have any tattoos?

1963
01:01:45,821 --> 01:01:46,691
- [Seth] No.

1964
01:01:46,691 --> 01:01:47,719
- Do you have any other siblings?

1965
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:49,400
- [Seth] No.

1966
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,567
- Interesting.

1967
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:52,341
- [Gary] That was a breakthrough moment.

1968
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:54,363
- Now we got him, now we'll go deep.

1969
01:01:54,363 --> 01:01:56,841
And I just, Seth and I
will be best friends.

1970
01:01:56,841 --> 01:01:57,674
- [Gary] Dude, you got chills?

1971
01:01:57,674 --> 01:01:59,757
- What the numbers, Seth?

1972
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:02,666
What are the numbers?

1973
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:05,107
- [Seth] Ah, it's coordinates, so it's...

1974
01:02:05,107 --> 01:02:07,091
- [Erin] Dude, I was looking
at Wikipedia last night

1975
01:02:07,091 --> 01:02:08,835
and thinking, why do they
put the coordinates on here?

1976
01:02:08,835 --> 01:02:10,149
Like, who is looking at this?

1977
01:02:10,149 --> 01:02:12,331
- [Gary] Fucking Seth.

1978
01:02:12,331 --> 01:02:13,361
- You guys can talk about this later

1979
01:02:13,361 --> 01:02:14,976
over a cab franc?

1980
01:02:14,976 --> 01:02:16,265
- Fine bottle of cabernet sauvignon.

1981
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:18,355
All right, wine number five.

1982
01:02:18,355 --> 01:02:19,423
Sniffy sniff.

1983
01:02:19,423 --> 01:02:21,886
- [Mary Kate] I already drank it.

1984
01:02:21,886 --> 01:02:22,719
- What do we got?

1985
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,552
Andre Mac.

1986
01:02:23,552 --> 01:02:25,965
- Smells a little bit soapy,
potpourri, aromatic...

1987
01:02:25,965 --> 01:02:27,777
- Soapy is so right.
- He always says potpourri.

1988
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:31,317
- Well, listen, potpourri
is, to his defense,

1989
01:02:31,317 --> 01:02:33,228
potpourri is easily the,

1990
01:02:33,228 --> 01:02:35,937
there's so much floral aspects to wine,

1991
01:02:35,937 --> 01:02:37,678
that whether you associate with potpourri,

1992
01:02:37,678 --> 01:02:38,511
whether you associate

1993
01:02:38,511 --> 01:02:39,344
with flowers.
- You can break it down now.

1994
01:02:39,344 --> 01:02:41,262
- You're gonna use the term.
- But don't you think

1995
01:02:41,262 --> 01:02:45,095
potpourri is like, dusty
and hard and crackly,

1996
01:02:46,432 --> 01:02:48,353
where floral is like,
- More vibe.

1997
01:02:48,353 --> 01:02:49,674
- Blooming and soft?

1998
01:02:49,674 --> 01:02:52,907
- This is where the way
you describe things matter.

1999
01:02:52,907 --> 01:02:53,740
Go ahead, Andre.

2000
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:55,029
- [Andre] But what happens
is that it gives off,

2001
01:02:55,029 --> 01:02:58,446
it's a more potent, more fabricated,

2002
01:02:58,446 --> 01:03:00,456
like, perfume odor,
- Okay, that makes

2003
01:03:00,456 --> 01:03:01,289
sense to me now.
- And that's what

2004
01:03:01,289 --> 01:03:03,085
I'm talking about, going
here, not, when I say floral,

2005
01:03:03,085 --> 01:03:04,496
yeah, I do recognize something soft

2006
01:03:04,496 --> 01:03:06,189
and maybe more natural.

2007
01:03:06,189 --> 01:03:08,615
This doesn't, even though,

2008
01:03:08,615 --> 01:03:10,989
it reminds me definitely
of, like, potpourri,

2009
01:03:10,989 --> 01:03:12,086
and we don't break it down any.

2010
01:03:12,086 --> 01:03:14,646
- Erin, favorite social network.

2011
01:03:14,646 --> 01:03:16,317
- [Erin] Social network...

2012
01:03:16,317 --> 01:03:18,774
- [Gary] Your favorite app.

2013
01:03:18,774 --> 01:03:19,857
- Oh, well...

2014
01:03:21,593 --> 01:03:22,865
definitely Twitter.

2015
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:23,698
- [Gary] Really?

2016
01:03:23,698 --> 01:03:26,732
- Yeah, I love, I mean I love comedians,

2017
01:03:26,732 --> 01:03:27,890
and I love writers.

2018
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:29,005
- You know what's true about your Twitter?

2019
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:30,944
The first time we engaged was on Twitter.

2020
01:03:30,944 --> 01:03:32,827
- I meet everyone on Twitter.

2021
01:03:32,827 --> 01:03:35,839
- What's crazy about that is,
your Twitter profile picture,

2022
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:37,415
I thought, this is not a joke,

2023
01:03:37,415 --> 01:03:38,712
this is a funny thing to say,

2024
01:03:38,712 --> 01:03:40,512
when you engaged with
a piece of my content,

2025
01:03:40,512 --> 01:03:42,680
and I'm like seeing it, like, as I do,

2026
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,168
I thought you were a media company.

2027
01:03:45,168 --> 01:03:46,626
Like, you have like some...

2028
01:03:46,626 --> 01:03:48,520
what is your picture on Twitter right now?

2029
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,147
- It was, it was after the election.

2030
01:03:50,147 --> 01:03:52,435
I don't know, I like, hadn't slept.

2031
01:03:52,435 --> 01:03:53,463
- [Gary] Yeah, what is that?

2032
01:03:53,463 --> 01:03:54,500
What is that, Nate?

2033
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:55,421
- I don't know, I made some weird--

2034
01:03:55,421 --> 01:03:57,316
- It's like a woman holding a flower?

2035
01:03:57,316 --> 01:03:58,983
- I was just
- All I remember is like--

2036
01:03:58,983 --> 01:04:00,122
- [Erin] No the back, you have to

2037
01:04:00,122 --> 01:04:00,955
see the background.
- I was like,

2038
01:04:00,955 --> 01:04:02,593
this meme account likes my content.

2039
01:04:02,593 --> 01:04:03,622
That's literally what I thought.

2040
01:04:03,622 --> 01:04:04,483
- [Erin] Oh, that's cool, I would

2041
01:04:04,483 --> 01:04:05,316
love to have the--
- And then I was like,

2042
01:04:05,316 --> 01:04:06,149
who's this person?

2043
01:04:06,149 --> 01:04:07,670
And then I googled, I'm like, what?

2044
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:10,204
I'm like, if I was a
model, I would definitely

2045
01:04:10,204 --> 01:04:12,220
not put this weird
fucking bullshit picture

2046
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:13,053
as my Twitter account.
- I hadn't slept!

2047
01:04:13,053 --> 01:04:15,078
- [Mary Kate] Probably want
to redirect her friends

2048
01:04:15,078 --> 01:04:15,911
not to see her Twitter.

2049
01:04:15,911 --> 01:04:17,108
It's like watching the
news too much, you know.

2050
01:04:17,108 --> 01:04:18,082
It's just sleepy, and I was like...

2051
01:04:18,082 --> 01:04:18,964
- So Twitter's your favorite.

2052
01:04:18,964 --> 01:04:19,797
Andre?

2053
01:04:19,797 --> 01:04:20,700
- [Andre] Instagram.

2054
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,448
- Yeah, you've been doing
damage on Instagram.

2055
01:04:22,448 --> 01:04:24,648
I've noticed you've, I've
been watching you for,

2056
01:04:24,648 --> 01:04:26,269
you know, it's funny that
we're doing this together.

2057
01:04:26,269 --> 01:04:28,090
We haven't talked in a long little while.

2058
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:29,681
- Not in a long time.

2059
01:04:29,681 --> 01:04:31,577
- And we used to hang out quite a bit,

2060
01:04:31,577 --> 01:04:33,862
based on my hangout style, which never.

2061
01:04:33,862 --> 01:04:35,210
- Guys, what happened, with you guys?

2062
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:37,533
- I got busy, I got busy, 100% my fault.

2063
01:04:37,533 --> 01:04:38,662
- No, I think we all got busy.

2064
01:04:38,662 --> 01:04:39,846
- Guys, this isn't a podcast,
this is an intervention.

2065
01:04:39,846 --> 01:04:42,096
- I got married at a diner.

2066
01:04:43,275 --> 01:04:45,600
And the ball dropped, so he signed it.

2067
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,459
We got married in a diner,
signed the certificate,

2068
01:04:47,459 --> 01:04:48,618
at midnight.

2069
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:50,637
We toasted with chocolate shakes,

2070
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:52,783
and we went to Gary's house for a party.

2071
01:04:52,783 --> 01:04:53,868
- [Gary] And played Monopoly.

2072
01:04:53,868 --> 01:04:56,293
- And the ball dropped,
everybody celebrated with us,

2073
01:04:56,293 --> 01:04:57,902
and then we had like a cliche honeymoon.

2074
01:04:57,902 --> 01:04:59,850
- Is it weird to ask what Monopoly?

2075
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:00,961
- Like, real Monopoly.

2076
01:05:00,961 --> 01:05:03,158
No, we played, listen, my life

2077
01:05:03,158 --> 01:05:05,683
is about competition.
- I'm scrabble, I'm Twitter.

2078
01:05:05,683 --> 01:05:06,706
- Like, all I'm thinking
about right now is,

2079
01:05:06,706 --> 01:05:07,871
everybody is listening, I'm like,

2080
01:05:07,871 --> 01:05:09,634
they'd better like me the
most of these four people.

2081
01:05:09,634 --> 01:05:11,172
Like, I am super competitive.

2082
01:05:11,172 --> 01:05:12,005
- Oh, are you?

2083
01:05:12,005 --> 01:05:13,360
Oh, should I step down?
- All the time,

2084
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,295
we're like, hanging out,

2085
01:05:14,295 --> 01:05:15,141
and he'd say--
- You don't need to step down,

2086
01:05:15,141 --> 01:05:15,974
I'm dominating you.

2087
01:05:15,974 --> 01:05:16,807
- He'd say, "Where's the boardgames at?"

2088
01:05:16,807 --> 01:05:17,817
He goes, "There's too
many people in this room."

2089
01:05:17,817 --> 01:05:18,650
- [Mary Kate] I think it's kind of

2090
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:21,247
the me and Andre show, right?

2091
01:05:21,247 --> 01:05:22,261
- I barely even, what's your name again?

2092
01:05:22,261 --> 01:05:24,094
- [Mary Kate] Exactly.

2093
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:26,253
I'll see myself out.

2094
01:05:26,253 --> 01:05:27,582
- So, you've done a really good job, like,

2095
01:05:27,582 --> 01:05:28,415
for me, it's really been fun,

2096
01:05:28,415 --> 01:05:32,638
because I feel like in a lot of ways,

2097
01:05:32,638 --> 01:05:34,460
you've picked up a torch that I left.

2098
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,563
- Dude, I listen to you.

2099
01:05:36,563 --> 01:05:39,507
So this dude shows up to my
house for a blind tasting,

2100
01:05:39,507 --> 01:05:41,145
so we have all these people coming.

2101
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:42,466
He rings the doorbell, he shows up,

2102
01:05:42,466 --> 01:05:44,465
and he's got a bottle
of Barolo in one hand

2103
01:05:44,465 --> 01:05:46,578
and he's got a bottle of
Cristal in the other hand,

2104
01:05:46,578 --> 01:05:48,150
and he's at the front door, and I'm like,

2105
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:51,903
"Dude, it's a blind tasting," right?

2106
01:05:51,903 --> 01:05:54,013
It's like, everybody knows
what the fucking wines are.

2107
01:05:54,013 --> 01:05:56,591
So we're like, okay, so
then we call to the store,

2108
01:05:56,591 --> 01:05:58,007
and we're like, "hey, we're
doing a blind tasting"

2109
01:05:58,007 --> 01:05:59,708
"at the house, this is the budget,"

2110
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:01,825
"can you brown bag all the
wines and bring them over?"

2111
01:06:01,825 --> 01:06:03,913
And so while we're waiting, he says,

2112
01:06:03,913 --> 01:06:05,135
"Hey, is this your laptop?"

2113
01:06:05,135 --> 01:06:06,954
We're in my kitchen, and he flips it open

2114
01:06:06,954 --> 01:06:09,285
and he starts fucking
typing and shit on it,

2115
01:06:09,285 --> 01:06:10,794
and I'm like, blown away.

2116
01:06:10,794 --> 01:06:12,003
Like, first and foremost,

2117
01:06:12,003 --> 01:06:15,411
what retail wine dude has five IT guys?

2118
01:06:15,411 --> 01:06:17,310
Like, I just couldn't understand that.

2119
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:20,432
Like, I was like, he must know
something that I don't know.

2120
01:06:20,432 --> 01:06:22,751
And then you flipped open
the computer and you're like,

2121
01:06:22,751 --> 01:06:25,324
showing me all the people
who had visited the site,

2122
01:06:25,324 --> 01:06:26,598
and talking about, like, Wine Library,

2123
01:06:26,598 --> 01:06:28,619
these are all the hits I'm
getting, and I was like,

2124
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:31,100
I should probably pay
attention to this dude.

2125
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:32,704
And it's, you know, I'm on Twitter

2126
01:06:32,704 --> 01:06:34,000
because you said be on Twitter.

2127
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:34,833
- I remember.

2128
01:06:34,833 --> 01:06:35,971
- Right, and you were
like, "Dude, no-no-no."

2129
01:06:35,971 --> 01:06:36,804
I was like, "I'm on it,

2130
01:06:36,804 --> 01:06:37,926
"what the fuck am I supposed to be doing?"

2131
01:06:37,926 --> 01:06:41,334
He's like, "Join the conversation,

2132
01:06:41,334 --> 01:06:42,444
hashtag chardonnay."
- You've done such a nice job.

2133
01:06:42,444 --> 01:06:44,686
- So, I take a lot of lead of seeing

2134
01:06:44,686 --> 01:06:45,625
what you guys have been doing,

2135
01:06:45,625 --> 01:06:50,260
and trying and apply it
in my field, in my world.

2136
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,537
It's been fun to experiment.

2137
01:06:52,537 --> 01:06:56,274
To be honest, that's what
keeps it fresh and new for me,

2138
01:06:56,274 --> 01:06:57,944
because getting on the road
and going to see people,

2139
01:06:57,944 --> 01:06:58,777
that's really fun, but,

2140
01:06:58,777 --> 01:06:59,979
like being able to--
- Yeah, you've done

2141
01:06:59,979 --> 01:07:01,819
a really nice job.
- To document and create that,

2142
01:07:01,819 --> 01:07:04,140
and the people that you
pick up along the way,

2143
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:06,346
that follow you, and you get it.

2144
01:07:06,346 --> 01:07:09,289
People, you know, you're not the kid from,

2145
01:07:09,289 --> 01:07:10,464
you know what I mean?

2146
01:07:10,464 --> 01:07:12,680
You're the wine guy to a
lot of the wine people.

2147
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,625
You were this wine guy
that was in New Jersey,

2148
01:07:14,625 --> 01:07:17,348
but to thousands and millions of people,

2149
01:07:17,348 --> 01:07:20,783
you became an inspiration to those people,

2150
01:07:20,783 --> 01:07:23,151
and the people back
there did not understand.

2151
01:07:23,151 --> 01:07:24,934
They can't get it, you
know, you know, you know.

2152
01:07:24,934 --> 01:07:27,175
- I know, I know
- Yeah, totally, I mean like,

2153
01:07:27,175 --> 01:07:30,527
I think that you make all the, like,

2154
01:07:30,527 --> 01:07:33,401
I think all the social
networks need someone

2155
01:07:33,401 --> 01:07:36,583
that make it look positive and interesting

2156
01:07:36,583 --> 01:07:39,771
and inspiring and, like highbrow.

2157
01:07:39,771 --> 01:07:41,558
Just, no one else is doing that like that.

2158
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:43,661
- [Gary] This has become my
favorite part of the show.

2159
01:07:43,661 --> 01:07:44,781
Mary Kate, what would you like to say

2160
01:07:44,781 --> 01:07:45,828
about my awesomeness?

2161
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:47,069
- I really like your new haircut.

2162
01:07:47,069 --> 01:07:47,904
- Thank you
- Everybody's like,

2163
01:07:47,904 --> 01:07:49,166
pumping his head up.
- Seth?

2164
01:07:49,166 --> 01:07:50,635
I'm the greatest boss you've ever had?

2165
01:07:50,635 --> 01:07:51,468
- Ever.

2166
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:52,570
- Trouty?

2167
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:53,403
- [Trouty] You're great.

2168
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:54,975
- Nate?

2169
01:07:54,975 --> 01:07:55,808
- [Nate] Yeah.

2170
01:07:55,808 --> 01:07:56,756
- You guys are losers
- Okay, Iris?

2171
01:07:56,756 --> 01:07:57,589
- [Iris] The awesomest.

2172
01:07:57,589 --> 01:07:58,997
- Great, my man?

2173
01:07:58,997 --> 01:07:59,830
- [Gary's Man] Yep?

2174
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:01,105
- Yep, D?

2175
01:08:01,105 --> 01:08:01,938
- [D] Of all time.

2176
01:08:01,938 --> 01:08:04,134
- All-time, listen, I think I want to know

2177
01:08:04,134 --> 01:08:06,393
what your favorite social
network is, Mary Kate.

2178
01:08:06,393 --> 01:08:08,201
- A thousand percent, Instagram.

2179
01:08:08,201 --> 01:08:09,064
- Thousand percent Instagram.

2180
01:08:09,064 --> 01:08:11,071
- A thousand percent, bullish on Insta.

2181
01:08:11,071 --> 01:08:12,062
- Why?

2182
01:08:12,062 --> 01:08:14,656
- It's the perfect mix.
- Of everything.

2183
01:08:14,656 --> 01:08:15,891
- Of everything.

2184
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:16,724
- [Gary] Seth?

2185
01:08:16,724 --> 01:08:17,557
- [Seth] Instagram.

2186
01:08:17,557 --> 01:08:18,390
- [Gary] Trout?

2187
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:19,223
- [Trouty] Instagram.

2188
01:08:19,223 --> 01:08:20,055
- [Gary] Nate?

2189
01:08:20,055 --> 01:08:20,888
- [Nate] Instagram.

2190
01:08:20,889 --> 01:08:22,109
- Boys are visual, guys.
- Iris.

2191
01:08:22,109 --> 01:08:22,942
- [Iris] Instagram.

2192
01:08:22,942 --> 01:08:24,397
- And Mary Kate, you
just do your own thing.

2193
01:08:24,397 --> 01:08:25,229
- [Mary Kate] I'm a boy.

2194
01:08:25,229 --> 01:08:26,062
- [Erin] You do your own thing.

2195
01:08:26,063 --> 01:08:27,774
- Wow, what a dominance for...

2196
01:08:27,774 --> 01:08:28,738
- [Andre] I totally believe it,

2197
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:31,370
and I feel like now that I've
embraced stories a little bit,

2198
01:08:31,371 --> 01:08:32,203
'cause I didn't really

2199
01:08:32,203 --> 01:08:33,249
fuck with Snapchat.
- Oh, the best.

2200
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:36,854
- But that gives me the broadcast,

2201
01:08:36,854 --> 01:08:39,490
kind of element that you
would associate with Twitter.

2202
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:40,459
Right?
- Wine number five.

2203
01:08:40,459 --> 01:08:42,469
What do we got, Mary Kate?

2204
01:08:42,469 --> 01:08:46,166
- [Mary Kate] (sigh) Just
really moved by today, so far.

2205
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:47,636
- [Gary] How long have you been here?

2206
01:08:47,636 --> 01:08:48,920
- Two hours!

2207
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:50,890
- [Gary] No, no, really,
how long have we been?

2208
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:52,685
- It's almost noon.

2209
01:08:52,685 --> 01:08:54,743
- It's almost noon.
- I just canceled my day.

2210
01:08:54,743 --> 01:08:55,576
- [Gary] I love it this

2211
01:08:55,577 --> 01:08:56,410
is so good.
- You guys, we're all going

2212
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:57,243
to my house afterwards
and playing Monopoly.

2213
01:08:57,243 --> 01:08:58,076
- [Erin] The theme of this should be

2214
01:08:58,076 --> 01:08:59,201
"I Can't Feel My Face When I'm With..."

2215
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:02,316
(all laughing)

2216
01:09:02,316 --> 01:09:03,149
- [Mary Kate] Why isn't there music

2217
01:09:03,149 --> 01:09:04,475
or air conditioning in here?

2218
01:09:04,475 --> 01:09:07,077
- [Gary] The Weekend
will be on episode two.

2219
01:09:07,077 --> 01:09:10,131
- [Mary Kate] We almost saw
them, nah, another story.

2220
01:09:10,131 --> 01:09:11,824
- [Erin] I like this, I like this.

2221
01:09:11,825 --> 01:09:13,447
- I hate this.
- Are we nosy-nosy?

2222
01:09:13,447 --> 01:09:14,582
- I think it's boring.

2223
01:09:14,582 --> 01:09:15,576
Andre?
- It is boring.

2224
01:09:15,576 --> 01:09:17,661
- [Andre] Cranberry, it's kind of blah.

2225
01:09:17,661 --> 01:09:22,221
I don't think that it, it
doesn't move me in a certain way.

2226
01:09:22,221 --> 01:09:25,374
And I feel like it's a little
bit on the acidic side.

2227
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:28,148
- It is acidic.
- Oh, it was acidic.

2228
01:09:28,148 --> 01:09:29,631
- [Erin] Back of the throat, no?

2229
01:09:29,631 --> 01:09:31,510
- [Andre] Yeah, and then
you accentuate acidity

2230
01:09:31,511 --> 01:09:34,581
on the sides of your
tongue, so if you, yeah.

2231
01:09:34,581 --> 01:09:35,995
So if you start to salivate or, like,

2232
01:09:35,995 --> 01:09:37,240
the sides of your tongue start to tingle,

2233
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,073
that means the wine

2234
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:39,558
is high on acid.
- Andre, favorite wine.

2235
01:09:39,558 --> 01:09:41,256
- [Andre] Oh, shit!

2236
01:09:41,256 --> 01:09:42,089
Uh...

2237
01:09:44,466 --> 01:09:45,715
Second to last.

2238
01:09:45,715 --> 01:09:46,923
- Number four.
- Farts.

2239
01:09:46,923 --> 01:09:47,756
- [Andre] Yeah, number four.

2240
01:09:47,756 --> 01:09:48,589
- [Mary Kate] Farts McGee.

2241
01:09:48,589 --> 01:09:49,676
- Number one.

2242
01:09:49,676 --> 01:09:51,077
- [Erin] I have to go with number one,

2243
01:09:51,078 --> 01:09:52,787
because I was a pioneer...
- You should, I love you!

2244
01:09:52,787 --> 01:09:54,960
- And if the price is right, it might win.

2245
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,355
- [Mary Kate] Can I
taste number three again?

2246
01:09:57,355 --> 01:09:58,188
- It might be the best one.
- Mary Kate,

2247
01:09:58,188 --> 01:09:59,021
it's not that serious.

2248
01:09:59,021 --> 01:10:00,017
- I'm just, I'm just thirsty.

2249
01:10:00,017 --> 01:10:01,275
- What's your favorite wine?

2250
01:10:01,275 --> 01:10:02,937
- [Andre] It's not that serious.

2251
01:10:02,937 --> 01:10:05,385
- [Gary] Mary Kate, you're
holding up the show.

2252
01:10:05,385 --> 01:10:07,329
It's already a fucking hour plus.

2253
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:08,357
People are gonna see the length

2254
01:10:08,357 --> 01:10:09,625
of this and be like, "Fuck that."

2255
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:12,002
- [Erin] (laughs) Fuck that.

2256
01:10:12,002 --> 01:10:14,686
- It's either two or four.

2257
01:10:14,686 --> 01:10:16,056
- [Gary] Two, that's nice.

2258
01:10:16,056 --> 01:10:18,672
Which one's your favorite wine?

2259
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:19,552
- Two.

2260
01:10:19,552 --> 01:10:20,385
- Okay.

2261
01:10:20,385 --> 01:10:21,565
Mine's four as well.

2262
01:10:21,565 --> 01:10:23,210
Okay, so four, so let's start

2263
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:24,406
with number five.
- You said four?

2264
01:10:24,406 --> 01:10:26,857
- Yeah.
- So, Andre and I are four.

2265
01:10:26,857 --> 01:10:29,503
Let's start with wine
number five, we just had it.

2266
01:10:29,503 --> 01:10:30,803
And let's see what it is.

2267
01:10:30,803 --> 01:10:32,086
Trout, you're ready?

2268
01:10:32,086 --> 01:10:32,950
With wine number five?

2269
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:33,783
All right, we're unveiling.

2270
01:10:33,783 --> 01:10:34,805
This is the big part of the

2271
01:10:34,805 --> 01:10:35,638
show in Brown Bags.
- Can we get Alexa

2272
01:10:35,638 --> 01:10:36,471
to give us a drum roll?

2273
01:10:36,471 --> 01:10:38,012
- Wine number five.

2274
01:10:38,012 --> 01:10:41,311
Mindego Ridge Pinot Noir from Santa Cruz.

2275
01:10:41,311 --> 01:10:42,144
I didn't even think

2276
01:10:42,144 --> 01:10:42,977
it was a Pinot.
- I liked it guys.

2277
01:10:42,977 --> 01:10:44,834
- Let alone, I didn't
think it was a Pinot, bro!

2278
01:10:44,834 --> 01:10:45,667
- [Erin] I knew it was a Pinot.

2279
01:10:45,667 --> 01:10:46,500
- You didn't think so either, right?

2280
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:47,750
- No.
- It wasn't as sweet.

2281
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:49,765
- How much, Trout, what do you got?

2282
01:10:49,765 --> 01:10:50,717
- [Trout] $47.99.

2283
01:10:50,717 --> 01:10:53,884
- $47.99, which is about $40 too much.

2284
01:10:54,928 --> 01:10:56,190
- [Trout] 93 points, Robert Parker.

2285
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:58,784
- 93 points, Parker, I
think he's losing a step.

2286
01:10:58,784 --> 01:11:00,540
- [Erin] You guys, I loved it.

2287
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:01,373
- [Trout] What else do you need to know?

2288
01:11:01,373 --> 01:11:02,230
- I don't know, that's about it.

2289
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:03,747
Santa Cruz is interesting, I was...

2290
01:11:03,747 --> 01:11:04,921
- How do the points work?

2291
01:11:04,921 --> 01:11:06,750
- I'm, so there's a--
- (mumbles) Rotten Tomatoes?

2292
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:08,572
- Hundred point, yeah,
it's kind of like that.

2293
01:11:08,572 --> 01:11:10,656
A hundred point scale,
hundred point scale.

2294
01:11:10,656 --> 01:11:11,994
Everything that's 90 and above

2295
01:11:11,994 --> 01:11:13,845
tends to get people's attention.

2296
01:11:13,845 --> 01:11:16,376
89 is like The Scarlet Letter.

2297
01:11:16,376 --> 01:11:17,833
Like, it's so fucking fucked up.

2298
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:21,188
If you get an 89 point
score, nobody wants you.

2299
01:11:21,188 --> 01:11:23,014
Yet, like, it's completely subjective,

2300
01:11:23,014 --> 01:11:25,312
and a 90, everybody wants you.

2301
01:11:25,312 --> 01:11:28,469
- [Andre] And you get
90, you blow up, yup.

2302
01:11:28,469 --> 01:11:30,255
- [Gary] It's like being
second for the cover of Vogue.

2303
01:11:30,255 --> 01:11:31,423
- [Erin] It's like B+ student, man.

2304
01:11:31,423 --> 01:11:34,150
- Yeah, all right, that was wild.

2305
01:11:34,150 --> 01:11:36,135
- I really like it.
- I am blown away

2306
01:11:36,135 --> 01:11:37,862
that Parker would score that 93 points.

2307
01:11:37,862 --> 01:11:39,756
It's not his normal kind of jam.

2308
01:11:39,756 --> 01:11:40,589
- Not even close.
- Maybe he wasn't drunk.

2309
01:11:40,589 --> 01:11:43,034
- I built my career on
knowing Parker's palate.

2310
01:11:43,034 --> 01:11:43,911
- [Trout] It's Jeb Dunnuck.

2311
01:11:43,911 --> 01:11:47,004
- Oh, Jeb Dunnuck, who, by
the way, I'm a big fan of.

2312
01:11:47,004 --> 01:11:49,923
That makes it a little
bit more understanding,

2313
01:11:49,923 --> 01:11:51,291
but I still don't agree with Jeff.

2314
01:11:51,291 --> 01:11:53,064
- [Mary Kate] Is Parker a cool guy?

2315
01:11:53,064 --> 01:11:53,897
- I like Parker.

2316
01:11:53,897 --> 01:11:54,826
Have you interacted with him?

2317
01:11:54,826 --> 01:11:56,183
- Yeah, he seems cool.
- I like Parker,

2318
01:11:56,183 --> 01:11:57,299
I thought he was a legend.

2319
01:11:57,299 --> 01:11:58,299
- Well, I mean, the things is, is like,

2320
01:11:58,299 --> 01:12:00,200
why be mad at him because
everybody follows him?

2321
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,717
- Because he's the gangster, and I,

2322
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:02,550
I was a big fan.
- Yeah, everybody

2323
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:03,383
followed him, I get it.

2324
01:12:03,383 --> 01:12:05,583
You know what, Erin, he was
the most powerful wine critic,

2325
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:07,079
he was a lawyer from Maryland,

2326
01:12:07,079 --> 01:12:11,904
and I thought he was unbelievably
humble for his power.

2327
01:12:11,904 --> 01:12:13,322
And the only people that hated him,

2328
01:12:13,322 --> 01:12:16,028
is when they, when he
reviewed their wine poorly,

2329
01:12:16,028 --> 01:12:18,518
and I have a lot of admiration for him.

2330
01:12:18,518 --> 01:12:20,342
And what I earlier said, five seconds ago,

2331
01:12:20,342 --> 01:12:22,274
I built my career on him.

2332
01:12:22,274 --> 01:12:25,420
I mean that because, once
I understood what he liked,

2333
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:26,253
I was able, you know how you said

2334
01:12:26,253 --> 01:12:27,791
you were in tune with your body?

2335
01:12:27,791 --> 01:12:30,345
I'm super in tune with a
lot of things, actually,

2336
01:12:30,345 --> 01:12:31,965
which is why I think I've done well,

2337
01:12:31,965 --> 01:12:33,937
and I was able to literally go backwards,

2338
01:12:33,937 --> 01:12:35,554
reverse engineer his palate,

2339
01:12:35,554 --> 01:12:37,969
and over the course of,
like, five to eight years,

2340
01:12:37,969 --> 01:12:41,014
got to a place where, whether
I agreed with him or not,

2341
01:12:41,014 --> 01:12:44,785
I had a good intuition on how
he would think about that wine

2342
01:12:44,785 --> 01:12:47,573
and that serviced me well
because I would make bets,

2343
01:12:47,573 --> 01:12:50,499
buy hundreds and hundreds
of cases of wine,

2344
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:52,671
that would always fit this criteria.

2345
01:12:52,671 --> 01:12:55,470
I liked it, and I thought
he would score it well.

2346
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:58,643
And I ended up being the
person that had all the wine

2347
01:12:58,643 --> 01:13:01,001
when, four months later, in the Advocate,

2348
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:03,011
a 95 point score would come out.

2349
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:04,291
- [Erin] Man, that's like an intuition

2350
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:05,246
thing at both ends.
- A hundred percent.

2351
01:13:05,246 --> 01:13:06,139
- A hundred percent.
- It's like, being like

2352
01:13:06,139 --> 01:13:07,043
I'm gonna go with this guy,

2353
01:13:07,043 --> 01:13:08,246
and I know what he's gonna like,

2354
01:13:08,246 --> 01:13:09,674
that's empathy.
- Okay, Andre and I

2355
01:13:09,674 --> 01:13:10,773
like number four.

2356
01:13:10,773 --> 01:13:13,054
You were a number two girl,
you were number one girl.

2357
01:13:13,054 --> 01:13:14,140
- Actually, I had said two and four.

2358
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:14,973
- So let's unveil number three.

2359
01:13:14,973 --> 01:13:16,056
- [Andre] The one that we didn't like,

2360
01:13:16,056 --> 01:13:16,889
that no one picked?
- Number two.

2361
01:13:16,889 --> 01:13:18,542
- Oh, yeah, number two got beat up pretty,

2362
01:13:18,542 --> 01:13:22,515
I'm sorry, number three
got beat up pretty good.

2363
01:13:22,515 --> 01:13:26,515
Okay, Envy Wines Cabernet
Calistoga Estate 2014.

2364
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:28,603
- [Trout] $55 retail.

2365
01:13:28,603 --> 01:13:30,646
- $55?

2366
01:13:30,646 --> 01:13:31,873
- [Trout] $48.99 at Wine Library.

2367
01:13:31,873 --> 01:13:34,399
- Okay, $48.99, fine,
good job Wine Library.

2368
01:13:34,399 --> 01:13:36,324
- What a steal.

2369
01:13:36,324 --> 01:13:38,726
- 91 Parker, wow, this time Parker Parker?

2370
01:13:38,726 --> 01:13:40,135
- [Trout] Parker Parker.

2371
01:13:40,135 --> 01:13:41,535
- We didn't agree.

2372
01:13:41,535 --> 01:13:42,832
We didst not agree on the show.

2373
01:13:42,832 --> 01:13:44,847
All right, one, two, four, okay.

2374
01:13:44,847 --> 01:13:46,932
So we're gonna unveil number one first.

2375
01:13:46,932 --> 01:13:49,352
Erin, this is your wine.

2376
01:13:49,352 --> 01:13:50,388
- [Erin] I think I'm ...

2377
01:13:50,388 --> 01:13:52,410
- This is your wine,
you liked it too, Andre.

2378
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:53,594
- [Andre] Yeah, I did, I did.

2379
01:13:53,594 --> 01:13:54,427
- Erin, do you wanna just leave it

2380
01:13:54,427 --> 01:13:55,783
in the brown bag for you to take?

2381
01:13:55,783 --> 01:13:56,616
- This is brown bagged and foiled.

2382
01:13:56,616 --> 01:13:57,449
- Maybe

2383
01:13:57,449 --> 01:13:59,028
- [Andre] We'll get you a do-rag as well.

2384
01:13:59,028 --> 01:14:02,333
- Wow, Janasse Cotes du Rhone Blanc!

2385
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:04,366
Erin, this is a pretty legit
producer, I'm a big fan.

2386
01:14:04,366 --> 01:14:06,136
- [Erin] I hope it's expensive.

2387
01:14:06,136 --> 01:14:07,455
- [Trout] 90 points Jeb Dunnuck.

2388
01:14:07,455 --> 01:14:08,994
- 90 points Jeb Dunnuck.

2389
01:14:08,994 --> 01:14:10,498
- $16 at Wine Library dot com.

2390
01:14:10,498 --> 01:14:11,331
- Fudge.

2391
01:14:11,331 --> 01:14:12,196
- Sixt, what are you.
- Well actually--

2392
01:14:12,196 --> 01:14:13,517
- Why did you go "fudge?"

2393
01:14:13,517 --> 01:14:16,019
No-no-no-no-no, you
shouldn't be disappointed

2394
01:14:16,019 --> 01:14:19,296
that you're under-$20-girl,
you should be pumped

2395
01:14:19,296 --> 01:14:20,129
that you found something--
- I know,

2396
01:14:20,129 --> 01:14:22,298
every time I'm under-$20-girl,
I just, like...

2397
01:14:22,298 --> 01:14:23,774
(laughter and applause)

2398
01:14:23,774 --> 01:14:25,174
Every time,

2399
01:14:25,174 --> 01:14:26,007
I'm such a cheap date!
- The word is out,

2400
01:14:26,007 --> 01:14:26,840
fellas, the word is out.

2401
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:31,030
- I love it, Seth, good
news, 16 bucks, bro.

2402
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:32,673
- I just don't like that bougie stuff.

2403
01:14:32,673 --> 01:14:33,506
It always rubs me

2404
01:14:33,506 --> 01:14:35,024
the wrong way.
- Trouty you are out,

2405
01:14:35,024 --> 01:14:37,282
Wine number two, this is your wine.

2406
01:14:37,282 --> 01:14:38,227
Mary Kate, you ready?

2407
01:14:38,227 --> 01:14:39,587
- [Mary Kate] Very excited.

2408
01:14:39,587 --> 01:14:40,420
- Let me take a peek at this.
- You know,

2409
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:41,888
it makes sense on the Cotes
du Rhone Blanc, right.

2410
01:14:41,888 --> 01:14:44,217
- [Andre] Yeah, because it
wasn't really high in acid.

2411
01:14:44,217 --> 01:14:45,693
- [Erin] What type of wine is this?

2412
01:14:45,693 --> 01:14:47,987
- And this was a white
burgundy, we had it, right?

2413
01:14:47,987 --> 01:14:50,770
Yep, Génot-Boulanger, do
you know this producer?

2414
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:52,156
This is a Chassagne-Montrachet.

2415
01:14:52,156 --> 01:14:52,989
- No, I don't know the producers.

2416
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:53,822
- Trouty, what do you got?

2417
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:56,728
This is a small producer,
Domaine Génot-Boulanger

2418
01:14:56,728 --> 01:14:59,626
Chassagne-Montrachet Premier Cru 2014,

2419
01:14:59,626 --> 01:15:02,554
single vineyard Les Vergernais.

2420
01:15:02,554 --> 01:15:05,513
- [Trouty] We've got 91 Wine
Spectator, $90 Wine Library.

2421
01:15:05,513 --> 01:15:06,734
- $90...

2422
01:15:06,734 --> 01:15:08,510
- Somewhere, lots of people are

2423
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:09,343
shaking their head.
- This is a Cru selection,

2424
01:15:09,343 --> 01:15:10,459
this is Robert Bohr.

2425
01:15:10,459 --> 01:15:11,688
- $90, is it Robert Bohr?

2426
01:15:11,688 --> 01:15:12,521
- [Andre] Yeah, yeah.

2427
01:15:12,521 --> 01:15:13,354
- Big shout-out to Mr. Bohr,

2428
01:15:13,354 --> 01:15:14,456
who we both love.
- Whose that?

2429
01:15:14,456 --> 01:15:16,758
- 90 bucks, really awesome
dude, used to be the head of,

2430
01:15:16,758 --> 01:15:19,665
he used to be at Zachy's,
then he was the head of Cru,

2431
01:15:19,665 --> 01:15:21,051
which was a big time...

2432
01:15:21,051 --> 01:15:23,131
And now he's got a bunch of restaurants

2433
01:15:23,131 --> 01:15:25,572
here in New York City.

2434
01:15:25,572 --> 01:15:27,131
What's the up burst...
- And he started this company.

2435
01:15:27,131 --> 01:15:29,130
- Charlie Bird, you know
Charlie Bird, right?

2436
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:30,056
The restaurant?
- Yeah, yes.

2437
01:15:30,056 --> 01:15:31,309
That's who it is.
- That's it man.

2438
01:15:31,309 --> 01:15:32,226
- 90 bucks.

2439
01:15:33,519 --> 01:15:34,352
- [Mary Kate] Please don't cut me.

2440
01:15:34,352 --> 01:15:35,746
- [Gary] You feel so good, right?

2441
01:15:35,746 --> 01:15:37,079
High class lady.

2442
01:15:38,346 --> 01:15:39,911
God, I wish this was visual.

2443
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:43,356
All right, Mr. Mac, you
and I, I mean, we agreed,

2444
01:15:43,356 --> 01:15:45,076
which puts extra pressure on us,

2445
01:15:45,076 --> 01:15:47,201
because we're supposed to be.
- I'm so curious.

2446
01:15:47,201 --> 01:15:49,873
- [Andre] And we're like, just shit, oh!

2447
01:15:49,873 --> 01:15:51,549
- Talk about it.

2448
01:15:51,549 --> 01:15:52,382
Tell 'em what it is.
- Grange des Pères,

2449
01:15:52,382 --> 01:15:54,102
one of the greatest...

2450
01:15:54,102 --> 01:15:55,103
(laughter)

2451
01:15:55,103 --> 01:15:56,487
- [Gary] By the way, let's
just stop right there.

2452
01:15:56,487 --> 01:15:58,177
- Oh my god, your face.

2453
01:15:58,177 --> 01:15:59,013
- He's very proud.
- It's so cute,

2454
01:15:59,013 --> 01:16:00,591
it's like you just saw your child.

2455
01:16:00,591 --> 01:16:01,845
- You have to understand why we're proud.

2456
01:16:01,845 --> 01:16:04,275
This is a, this was double blind.

2457
01:16:04,275 --> 01:16:06,525
We knew nothing, and
you have to understand,

2458
01:16:06,525 --> 01:16:09,446
for us, there were bigger stakes here,

2459
01:16:09,446 --> 01:16:11,714
which is, we'd like to
be proud of what we like.

2460
01:16:11,714 --> 01:16:13,779
- [Erin] This is like Remember the Titans.

2461
01:16:13,779 --> 01:16:15,550
- Nah, dude, this is one
of the greatest wines,

2462
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:18,241
it's one of the greatest wines of France,

2463
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:20,657
Grange des Pères, it's 2012.

2464
01:16:20,657 --> 01:16:22,937
And I haven't had this wine in years.

2465
01:16:22,937 --> 01:16:23,770
- [Gary] It was great.

2466
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:24,932
- [Erin] It's like seeing an old friend.

2467
01:16:24,932 --> 01:16:26,245
- Ah, Mr. Troutman?

2468
01:16:26,245 --> 01:16:28,031
- $105.
- $105.

2469
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:30,341
- [Trouty] Totally
unrated, it's a cult wine.

2470
01:16:30,341 --> 01:16:31,678
It just doesn't score it, yeah.

2471
01:16:31,678 --> 01:16:34,657
- What's the grape breakdown
on this, do you know?

2472
01:16:34,657 --> 01:16:35,490
Do you know, Trout,

2473
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:36,410
can you look it up?
- I have no idea anymore.

2474
01:16:36,410 --> 01:16:37,619
- [Erin] What a curve ball.

2475
01:16:37,619 --> 01:16:38,452
- I'm gonna actually gonna pour myself--

2476
01:16:38,452 --> 01:16:40,132
- Can I have more, thank you so much.

2477
01:16:40,132 --> 01:16:42,863
- [Trouty] 40% Syrah, 40% Mourvedre.

2478
01:16:42,863 --> 01:16:43,815
- [Gary] 40% Syrah?

2479
01:16:43,815 --> 01:16:45,263
- [Trouty] 40% Mourvedre.

2480
01:16:45,263 --> 01:16:47,096
The 20% is a balance

2481
01:16:47,096 --> 01:16:48,180
of field grapes.
- Got it.

2482
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:50,846
- Mourvedre, which is a great grape,

2483
01:16:50,846 --> 01:16:54,093
and 20% field grapes, pour that.

2484
01:16:54,093 --> 01:16:55,755
Andre, I'm pretty happy with myself here.

2485
01:16:55,755 --> 01:16:58,019
I expect to, like, have some bad episodes

2486
01:16:58,019 --> 01:17:00,371
of Brown Bags, but, I think
with drilled this one.

2487
01:17:00,371 --> 01:17:01,312
- [Erin] I almost cried.

2488
01:17:01,312 --> 01:17:02,145
- [Andre] It's all game.

2489
01:17:02,145 --> 01:17:03,810
- Was this the one that I
said if it was 20 bucks,

2490
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:04,693
it'd be a good yeah.

2491
01:17:04,693 --> 01:17:05,526
(laughter)

2492
01:17:05,526 --> 01:17:08,205
Guys, it's not 20 bucks,
it's a hundred and five.

2493
01:17:08,205 --> 01:17:10,178
It didn't work out, but, good news.

2494
01:17:10,178 --> 01:17:11,785
A couple of you are ballers,

2495
01:17:11,785 --> 01:17:13,731
so instead of buying a dumb fucking watch

2496
01:17:13,731 --> 01:17:16,633
or Lamborghini, buy a case of this wine.

2497
01:17:16,633 --> 01:17:17,466
It will...

2498
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:18,386
- [Erin] Take me out
for dinner, I'm cheap.

2499
01:17:18,386 --> 01:17:19,874
(laughter)

2500
01:17:19,874 --> 01:17:21,316
- [Gary] No, no, Erin, you're $16.

2501
01:17:21,316 --> 01:17:22,268
This is a hundred and five.

2502
01:17:22,268 --> 01:17:23,101
They can take you on ten dates,

2503
01:17:23,101 --> 01:17:24,430
eight dates, seven.
- No, I know, that's my wine,

2504
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:25,499
I, okay, yeah (laughs)

2505
01:17:25,499 --> 01:17:28,218
- Seven dates with Erin, or this bottle.

2506
01:17:28,218 --> 01:17:31,412
Seth, you're still young in your career.

2507
01:17:31,412 --> 01:17:33,666
Great news, you can afford the supermodel.

2508
01:17:33,666 --> 01:17:35,481
Um, let's wrap it up.

2509
01:17:35,481 --> 01:17:37,409
Mr. Mac, what do you got to say?

2510
01:17:37,409 --> 01:17:41,715
Good first or, do you feel
the way I do, which is,

2511
01:17:41,715 --> 01:17:44,692
there's a good chance that
in your Wikipedia entry,

2512
01:17:44,692 --> 01:17:48,277
being a guest on episode
one of Brown Bags, may,

2513
01:17:48,277 --> 01:17:49,992
that we're onto something here?

2514
01:17:49,992 --> 01:17:51,742
- Yes, it's gonna change my life.

2515
01:17:51,742 --> 01:17:53,858
- [Gary] (laughs) Erin?

2516
01:17:53,858 --> 01:17:55,478
- Oh my god, I don't even know where I am.

2517
01:17:55,478 --> 01:17:57,094
(all laughing)

2518
01:17:57,094 --> 01:17:59,585
- You can't feel your face?

2519
01:17:59,585 --> 01:18:00,811
(all laughing)

2520
01:18:00,811 --> 01:18:01,644
- [Gary] Mary Kate?

2521
01:18:01,644 --> 01:18:05,406
- I felt, I feel like I found
three new best friends today.

2522
01:18:05,406 --> 01:18:06,621
- [Gary] What, we weren't friends before?

2523
01:18:06,621 --> 01:18:07,566
- No, best friends.

2524
01:18:07,566 --> 01:18:08,566
- [Gary] Seth, Seth.

2525
01:18:08,566 --> 01:18:09,399
- Seth.

2526
01:18:09,399 --> 01:18:10,745
- [Gary] Seth, you found Seth.

2527
01:18:10,745 --> 01:18:11,578
- I found Seth.

2528
01:18:11,578 --> 01:18:15,263
Um, I love you guys, I love
wine, and I'm so excited

2529
01:18:15,263 --> 01:18:17,123
for this to be the only
episode of this show.

2530
01:18:17,123 --> 01:18:18,554
(all laughing)

2531
01:18:18,554 --> 01:18:20,476
- Mary Kate, we'll start with
you and go the other way.

2532
01:18:20,476 --> 01:18:21,890
I love culture hacking.

2533
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:24,003
What's happening in culture right now

2534
01:18:24,003 --> 01:18:25,961
that has your attention?

2535
01:18:25,961 --> 01:18:27,277
Let's end with this.
- That's a great question.

2536
01:18:27,277 --> 01:18:28,514
- It's a great thing to end with.

2537
01:18:28,514 --> 01:18:30,211
It's our new thing, I just
made it up on the spot.

2538
01:18:30,211 --> 01:18:31,452
- [Erin] Wait, I have to think.

2539
01:18:31,452 --> 01:18:33,086
- I understand, good news, you're second.

2540
01:18:33,086 --> 01:18:34,555
- It's all in my ear.

2541
01:18:34,555 --> 01:18:36,329
It's, like, we've all been walking around

2542
01:18:36,329 --> 01:18:39,393
with earphones and Beats
and Pods and whatnot

2543
01:18:39,393 --> 01:18:40,863
for the past couple years, but now,

2544
01:18:40,863 --> 01:18:43,768
it's cerebral and it's smart in podcasts,

2545
01:18:43,768 --> 01:18:48,503
and like, it's ridiculously
dope with Jay-Z's new album.

2546
01:18:48,503 --> 01:18:50,444
It's just everything...
- Do you love the new album?

2547
01:18:50,444 --> 01:18:53,335
- I love, it's on repeat,
I love it so much.

2548
01:18:53,335 --> 01:18:54,600
And then it's Alexa...

2549
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,780
- Him admitting that he was...

2550
01:18:56,780 --> 01:18:58,384
- [Mary Kate] Oh, Becky,
all of it, it's so good!

2551
01:18:58,384 --> 01:19:00,311
- Like, him admitting
that he was a bad guy,

2552
01:19:00,311 --> 01:19:01,977
weirdly makes him a great guy?

2553
01:19:01,977 --> 01:19:04,028
Explain this to me from
a female perspective.

2554
01:19:04,028 --> 01:19:05,798
- It's, yeah, it's, that's...

2555
01:19:05,798 --> 01:19:07,191
- [Gary] Is that where fame
just lets you do anything?

2556
01:19:07,191 --> 01:19:08,963
- Well, no, because that's--
- I have a funny feeling that

2557
01:19:08,963 --> 01:19:12,852
if Seth admitted that he cheated on Erin,

2558
01:19:12,852 --> 01:19:15,602
that she'd be, not like,
"He's a great guy."

2559
01:19:15,602 --> 01:19:16,435
- [Mary Kate] Well, how about

2560
01:19:16,435 --> 01:19:17,268
this week being like--
- Erin.

2561
01:19:17,268 --> 01:19:18,101
- If he cheated, I'd be like,

2562
01:19:18,101 --> 01:19:21,326
oh, thanks for the
telling me, saved my time.

2563
01:19:21,326 --> 01:19:24,000
- No, it's like the,
it's like that email doc.

2564
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,691
It's like Donald Trump Junior being like,

2565
01:19:26,691 --> 01:19:29,013
"Here are the emails that
show that there's collusion."

2566
01:19:29,013 --> 01:19:31,014
Like, it's, no, it doesn't work.

2567
01:19:31,014 --> 01:19:32,932
- [Gary] So, in your ear is
what's most interesting to you.

2568
01:19:32,932 --> 01:19:34,926
- In my ear, it's all
happening, it's awesome.

2569
01:19:34,926 --> 01:19:36,911
- [Gary] You agree with
me that voice, sound...

2570
01:19:36,911 --> 01:19:40,047
- A thousand percent, I see
the three-year-old Charlie

2571
01:19:40,047 --> 01:19:42,586
asking Alexa to play "Imperial March."

2572
01:19:42,586 --> 01:19:44,101
- [Gary] Alexa, please
play "Imperial March."

2573
01:19:44,101 --> 01:19:46,401
- It's like the seventh time today.

2574
01:19:46,401 --> 01:19:47,872
By John C. Williams.

2575
01:19:47,872 --> 01:19:49,861
("Imperial March" by John C. Williams)

2576
01:19:49,861 --> 01:19:50,694
- Erin?

2577
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,542
- Do we have the rights to this song?

2578
01:19:53,542 --> 01:19:54,375
- [Gary] Shh!

2579
01:19:54,375 --> 01:19:55,432
Mary Kate, you're finished.

2580
01:19:55,432 --> 01:19:56,748
- What do you mean in culture?

2581
01:19:56,748 --> 01:20:00,031
- What is happening in the
world that has your attention?

2582
01:20:00,031 --> 01:20:01,915
An artist, an event--
- Stand-up comedy.

2583
01:20:01,915 --> 01:20:02,748
- [Gary] What?

2584
01:20:02,748 --> 01:20:03,581
- Stand-up comedy.

2585
01:20:03,581 --> 01:20:06,916
- [Gary] Stand, Alexa, stand-up,
all right, that's fine.

2586
01:20:06,916 --> 01:20:10,590
Alexa, please stop, (laughs) don't stand.

2587
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:11,423
Alexa, please stop.

2588
01:20:11,423 --> 01:20:12,340
- Sit down.

2589
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:14,701
Be humble.

2590
01:20:14,701 --> 01:20:16,044
- [Gary] All right, Erin.

2591
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:19,165
- Comedy, dude, that's the
only thing, that's all I do.

2592
01:20:19,165 --> 01:20:20,275
- [Gary] You do stand-up comedy,

2593
01:20:20,275 --> 01:20:22,443
or you consume it?
- No, no, I just consume it.

2594
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:24,099
- [Gary] Who are you interested in now?

2595
01:20:24,099 --> 01:20:25,503
- I've watched everything on Netflix

2596
01:20:25,503 --> 01:20:27,275
and I learned something about myself.

2597
01:20:27,275 --> 01:20:28,501
It's pretty depressing.

2598
01:20:28,501 --> 01:20:29,334
(laughs) I had to re-watch
The Rez last night.

2599
01:20:29,334 --> 01:20:31,584
(laughter)

2600
01:20:33,874 --> 01:20:34,760
And I've seen it already.
- Have you watched

2601
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:35,740
Chappelle's stand-ups?

2602
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:37,880
Parts one and two?
- Yeah, of course, yeah.

2603
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:38,713
Yeah.

2604
01:20:38,713 --> 01:20:39,924
- Okay, fair, comedy.

2605
01:20:39,924 --> 01:20:41,571
- [Erin] No, I'm like,
deep, deep in comedy.

2606
01:20:41,571 --> 01:20:43,064
Like, I've been watching comedy
since I was a little kid.

2607
01:20:43,064 --> 01:20:44,006
Like, that's my wine.

2608
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:46,138
- Who's your favorite
stand-up comedian of all time?

2609
01:20:46,138 --> 01:20:48,515
- Louis C.K., obviously,
but he lived in my apartment

2610
01:20:48,515 --> 01:20:49,953
before me, I get his mail.

2611
01:20:49,953 --> 01:20:51,477
And I didn't even know
that, that's the line.

2612
01:20:51,477 --> 01:20:52,646
- [Gary] Your actual apartment?

2613
01:20:52,646 --> 01:20:53,514
- Yes.

2614
01:20:53,514 --> 01:20:54,381
- [Gary] Amazing.

2615
01:20:54,381 --> 01:20:55,648
- Seth is so excited.

2616
01:20:55,648 --> 01:20:56,932
- [Gary] What is your favorite, all-time,

2617
01:20:56,932 --> 01:20:58,599
comedian, Mary Kate?

2618
01:21:00,449 --> 01:21:02,604
- It's funny because I just
watched it on a flight,

2619
01:21:02,604 --> 01:21:05,997
the documentary on Misery Loves Comedy?

2620
01:21:05,997 --> 01:21:06,830
Did you guys see that?

2621
01:21:06,830 --> 01:21:09,767
- Of course, but then?
- Oh shit, I'm naked.

2622
01:21:09,767 --> 01:21:11,045
- I like how you're buying time.

2623
01:21:11,045 --> 01:21:13,878
Who's your favorite all-time comedian?

2624
01:21:13,878 --> 01:21:15,461
Stand-up, stand-up.

2625
01:21:16,732 --> 01:21:17,565
- [Mary Kate] See, that's a problem.

2626
01:21:17,565 --> 01:21:19,222
- All right, I'll go,
Richard Pryor for me.

2627
01:21:19,222 --> 01:21:20,055
Mr. Mac?

2628
01:21:20,055 --> 01:21:20,888
- [Andre] Rock.

2629
01:21:20,888 --> 01:21:22,730
- Chris Rock, and for you?

2630
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:25,054
- I don't wanna sound like the girl

2631
01:21:25,054 --> 01:21:28,156
who picked the second
most expensive wine here,

2632
01:21:28,156 --> 01:21:30,518
but I feel like Seinfeld did something

2633
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:33,643
to make comedy, like, very accessible.

2634
01:21:33,643 --> 01:21:36,308
But, I don't love his stand-up.

2635
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:37,141
Jerry, if you're listening,

2636
01:21:37,141 --> 01:21:37,974
I'm so sorry.
- Interesting,

2637
01:21:37,974 --> 01:21:39,490
I thought he was great.

2638
01:21:39,490 --> 01:21:41,453
I saw recently at, where was he?

2639
01:21:41,453 --> 01:21:43,523
Yeah, at Broadside, where was he?

2640
01:21:43,523 --> 01:21:44,767
Yeah.

2641
01:21:44,767 --> 01:21:46,651
- I go to comedy stuff
by myself all the time.

2642
01:21:46,651 --> 01:21:48,309
It's like my hobby.

2643
01:21:48,309 --> 01:21:49,142
- [Mary Kate] Best friend, should we go

2644
01:21:49,142 --> 01:21:50,495
to the comedy show now?
- Now you can go with Seth.

2645
01:21:50,495 --> 01:21:52,134
Seth, where are you taking Erin?

2646
01:21:52,134 --> 01:21:54,160
Which comedy club are
you and Erin going to

2647
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,110
on your first date?

2648
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:56,160
- Which is your fave?

2649
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:57,481
(laughter)

2650
01:21:57,481 --> 01:21:58,874
- [Gary] Andre, favorite stand-up comic.

2651
01:21:58,874 --> 01:22:00,863
Oh, I'm sorry, excuse
me, culture, culture.

2652
01:22:00,863 --> 01:22:02,122
- Culture, I mean, lots
of different things

2653
01:22:02,122 --> 01:22:03,971
have piqued my interest.

2654
01:22:03,971 --> 01:22:06,502
Obviously from a wine standpoint,

2655
01:22:06,502 --> 01:22:09,562
I really feel like athletes,

2656
01:22:09,562 --> 01:22:12,354
and people who look like
me, that whole genre,

2657
01:22:12,354 --> 01:22:14,247
black folks don't really drink wine.

2658
01:22:14,247 --> 01:22:15,339
Let's just put it out there, you know.

2659
01:22:15,339 --> 01:22:16,372
It's not a...

2660
01:22:16,372 --> 01:22:18,438
- [Gary] Yeah, obviously,
this is audio, Andre is black.

2661
01:22:18,438 --> 01:22:21,006
- You know what I mean,
so there's not a, like,

2662
01:22:21,006 --> 01:22:22,444
I'm excited to see that, you know,

2663
01:22:22,444 --> 01:22:24,317
LeBron James just did this whole video

2664
01:22:24,317 --> 01:22:26,831
of them in the barbershop,
Steve Stoute shows up

2665
01:22:26,831 --> 01:22:28,161
with nine year Latour

2666
01:22:28,161 --> 01:22:30,187
- Stoute!
- That's hardcore wine.

2667
01:22:30,187 --> 01:22:32,716
Stoute loves wine, Jay-Z loves
wine, you know this before.

2668
01:22:32,716 --> 01:22:34,829
- Totally, yeah.

2669
01:22:34,829 --> 01:22:35,861
- You think that's cool, right?

2670
01:22:35,861 --> 01:22:37,275
- I think it's cool
because what happens is,

2671
01:22:37,275 --> 01:22:39,512
we live in a world where--

2672
01:22:39,512 --> 01:22:41,905
- [Gary] Are you holding
that Weezy texts you

2673
01:22:41,905 --> 01:22:43,410
and says, like--
- I already had that meeting.

2674
01:22:43,410 --> 01:22:44,243
- [Gary] You did.

2675
01:22:44,243 --> 01:22:45,076
- Yeah.
- Well, let's wait a minute.

2676
01:22:45,076 --> 01:22:45,909
Let's extend this.

2677
01:22:45,909 --> 01:22:47,887
- We already had that meeting, but they,

2678
01:22:47,887 --> 01:22:50,108
it's so much--
- Was Birdman there?

2679
01:22:50,108 --> 01:22:52,248
- No, there were a
whole bunch of attorneys

2680
01:22:52,248 --> 01:22:54,756
from Capitol Records that were there.

2681
01:22:54,756 --> 01:22:55,845
- Oh, from a business standpoint,

2682
01:22:55,845 --> 01:22:57,438
you were thinking about doing a JV with...

2683
01:22:57,438 --> 01:22:58,271
- [Andre] We were doing
something with them,

2684
01:22:58,271 --> 01:23:00,063
but the same reason why you left

2685
01:23:00,063 --> 01:23:02,038
is the same reason why they're
like, fuck, dude, like,

2686
01:23:02,038 --> 01:23:04,192
it's so much, I mean it's
easier to ship toxic waste

2687
01:23:04,192 --> 01:23:06,260
in this country than it is
to shape a case of wine.

2688
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:08,509
- Literally, guys, you
can buy a grenade online

2689
01:23:08,509 --> 01:23:09,604
easier than you can buy wine.

2690
01:23:09,604 --> 01:23:10,437
- Why?
- And they were like,

2691
01:23:10,437 --> 01:23:11,270
fuck it, you know what?

2692
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:12,828
We're in the books.

2693
01:23:12,828 --> 01:23:13,715
- Prohibition, prohibition, uh-huh.

2694
01:23:13,715 --> 01:23:15,639
- [Andre] So they went with
a totally different way.

2695
01:23:15,639 --> 01:23:16,479
- But wait a minute, take a step back.

2696
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:18,397
Wayne is like the best.
- I love him.

2697
01:23:18,397 --> 01:23:20,074
- Were you like, losing your
mind that you were there?

2698
01:23:20,074 --> 01:23:22,352
- No, you know, I've met people before.

2699
01:23:22,352 --> 01:23:23,684
- Yeah, but, like, you
know how it is, though.

2700
01:23:23,684 --> 01:23:26,301
Like, like, of course you've
met cool people before,

2701
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:27,297
famous people.
- And now you've met Erin.

2702
01:23:27,297 --> 01:23:28,296
- But like yeah, I mean...

2703
01:23:28,296 --> 01:23:29,441
- [Andre] I know, I had no idea.

2704
01:23:29,441 --> 01:23:30,274
- And now?

2705
01:23:30,274 --> 01:23:31,450
- [Andre] We were just talking.

2706
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:33,244
- The comedy cellar, don't

2707
01:23:33,244 --> 01:23:34,077
(laughter)

2708
01:23:34,077 --> 01:23:34,910
- Oh my God.

2709
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:37,171
- You flawed when she said vom, right.

2710
01:23:37,171 --> 01:23:38,937
- I think culturally,
you know what I mean,

2711
01:23:38,937 --> 01:23:40,746
like let's just talk about it.

2712
01:23:40,746 --> 01:23:41,790
- Wine is cooler than it's ever been.

2713
01:23:41,790 --> 01:23:43,544
- Black folks didn't drink tequila.

2714
01:23:43,544 --> 01:23:46,637
T-Pain, and Usher started
talking about Patrone,

2715
01:23:46,637 --> 01:23:48,309
and the next thing you
know, they are backward,

2716
01:23:48,309 --> 01:23:49,142
and in New York.

2717
01:23:49,142 --> 01:23:50,869
You know, something that's
considered kind of a--

2718
01:23:50,869 --> 01:23:52,441
- Let's be very clear.

2719
01:23:52,441 --> 01:23:53,378
Hip-Hop.
- Yeah.

2720
01:23:53,378 --> 01:23:54,616
- Is the foundation of culture.

2721
01:23:54,616 --> 01:23:55,449
- [Andre] Okay.

2722
01:23:55,449 --> 01:23:57,493
- Like that is very clear in 2017.

2723
01:23:57,493 --> 01:23:58,933
- [Erin] Do we all watch The Defiant Ones?

2724
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:00,633
- [Andre] Yep, it is amazing.

2725
01:24:00,633 --> 01:24:02,163
- I'm only listening
to Snoop Dog right now.

2726
01:24:02,163 --> 01:24:03,718
- [Gary] You love Snoop?

2727
01:24:03,718 --> 01:24:05,676
- Yeah, I love Snoop.

2728
01:24:05,676 --> 01:24:08,343
I'm listening to music pre 2000,

2729
01:24:09,834 --> 01:24:12,499
for everything I pitied.
- Post 2004, everything sucks.

2730
01:24:12,499 --> 01:24:13,488
- Everything sucked after that.

2731
01:24:13,488 --> 01:24:15,320
- [Gary] You hate Drake in the weekend.

2732
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:17,163
- I don't know, I'm not a hater.

2733
01:24:17,163 --> 01:24:18,701
- [Gary] Well, you just said they suck.

2734
01:24:18,701 --> 01:24:20,815
- No, no, but there's something about...

2735
01:24:20,815 --> 01:24:23,481
It's just like smell, it's
the strongest connection

2736
01:24:23,481 --> 01:24:24,569
to your memories.

2737
01:24:24,569 --> 01:24:26,197
- [Gary] 2004, is the
strongest connection to you.

2738
01:24:26,197 --> 01:24:28,060
- There's just something
about listening to music

2739
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:28,893
that's from the time you love.
- Nate,

2740
01:24:28,893 --> 01:24:30,264
what's your favorite music?

2741
01:24:30,264 --> 01:24:31,097
- My favorite music--

2742
01:24:31,097 --> 01:24:31,943
- Whose your favorite, John Mayer,

2743
01:24:31,943 --> 01:24:32,879
who I was with last night,

2744
01:24:32,879 --> 01:24:34,047
and didn't invite you.
- He did show up?

2745
01:24:34,047 --> 01:24:34,880
- [Gary] Yeah, and you are super

2746
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:37,101
upset with me.
- Totally super sad.

2747
01:24:37,101 --> 01:24:37,934
- [Erin] You love John Mayer?

2748
01:24:37,934 --> 01:24:39,368
- [Gary] John's fuckin' wild.

2749
01:24:39,368 --> 01:24:42,525
- [Mary Kate] Nate is
your body on an Island?

2750
01:24:42,525 --> 01:24:44,016
- [Gary] Nate take the shirt off.

2751
01:24:44,016 --> 01:24:47,378
Guys watch this, Nate
please take the shirt off.

2752
01:24:47,378 --> 01:24:48,285
- Nate, take the shirt--
- He made me do this

2753
01:24:48,285 --> 01:24:49,402
at an L.A holiday.

2754
01:24:49,402 --> 01:24:50,914
(all laughing)

2755
01:24:50,914 --> 01:24:53,657
- [Gary] Can you do it again Nate?

2756
01:24:53,657 --> 01:24:55,697
- [Mary Kate] This is like
a Podcast, no one could see.

2757
01:24:55,697 --> 01:24:56,530
- It's devastating.

2758
01:24:56,530 --> 01:24:57,648
- [Andre] And then the
other thing is, is that,

2759
01:24:57,648 --> 01:25:00,434
I'm big on voice, I've
been on voice dictation

2760
01:25:00,434 --> 01:25:01,942
for the last four years.

2761
01:25:01,942 --> 01:25:03,314
I answer all my emails that way.

2762
01:25:03,314 --> 01:25:04,147
I'm writing my

2763
01:25:04,147 --> 01:25:06,238
new book that way.
- Is that right?

2764
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:09,540
- My kids know how to do it,
they can't even spell shit,

2765
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:12,461
but they know the double tap,
f-ing key on the computer,

2766
01:25:12,461 --> 01:25:13,518
and then they say what they want.

2767
01:25:13,518 --> 01:25:15,867
- Andre, do you still
have that Beaune Thugs,

2768
01:25:15,867 --> 01:25:17,753
Beaune T-shirt thing.
- Yeah.

2769
01:25:17,753 --> 01:25:18,586
- Can you send me one?

2770
01:25:18,586 --> 01:25:20,020
I need to rock that.
- Yeah sure.

2771
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:20,853
- What is it again?

2772
01:25:20,853 --> 01:25:21,686
What does it say?

2773
01:25:21,686 --> 01:25:22,589
- [Andre] Just says
Beaune Thugs and Burgundy.

2774
01:25:22,589 --> 01:25:24,150
- Right, because guys, for
everybody whose watching,

2775
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:26,709
Beaune, is like this region in France,

2776
01:25:26,709 --> 01:25:28,549
and so that's the way he spells it.

2777
01:25:28,549 --> 01:25:30,532
I love Bone Thugs, and so when I saw that,

2778
01:25:30,532 --> 01:25:32,640
like I loved that stuff.
- I love Bone Thugs.

2779
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:33,511
- And so, like culturally,

2780
01:25:33,511 --> 01:25:36,437
like I'm excited for a lot
of like what technology

2781
01:25:36,437 --> 01:25:37,620
has like put us.

2782
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:38,616
You know, I showed up to New York,

2783
01:25:38,616 --> 01:25:39,915
and like nobody in the wine business

2784
01:25:39,915 --> 01:25:41,440
had a Blackberry.
- Nope.

2785
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,164
- Everybody made fun
of me in the restaurant

2786
01:25:43,164 --> 01:25:45,572
because I always had
headphones on, everyone.

2787
01:25:45,572 --> 01:25:47,865
Like my parting gift, when in left in '07,

2788
01:25:47,865 --> 01:25:50,283
was Bose headphones, right.

2789
01:25:50,283 --> 01:25:52,037
Cause everybody just
thought that was funny.

2790
01:25:52,037 --> 01:25:54,798
And then a year or two later,

2791
01:25:54,798 --> 01:25:56,536
everybody is walking
around, and everybody has

2792
01:25:56,536 --> 01:25:58,077
headphones on.
- Right, do you make

2793
01:25:58,077 --> 01:25:58,910
fun of them now?

2794
01:25:58,910 --> 01:25:59,743
Like do you see them,

2795
01:25:59,743 --> 01:26:00,576
and be like--
- No, no, no,

2796
01:26:00,576 --> 01:26:02,291
we just kinda let it be known.

2797
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:03,511
- That you established it
- Well, that's interesting

2798
01:26:03,511 --> 01:26:06,532
cause you're auditory
that's why you speak.

2799
01:26:06,532 --> 01:26:08,043
That's what your veered towards.

2800
01:26:08,043 --> 01:26:10,733
- [Andre] Yeah, and it's
just so much easier,

2801
01:26:10,733 --> 01:26:11,742
my whole thing is like,

2802
01:26:11,742 --> 01:26:14,623
I wanna write this book
100% voice dictation.

2803
01:26:14,623 --> 01:26:16,250
- That's right.
- What does it talk about?

2804
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:18,945
- It's just a part memoir, part wine book.

2805
01:26:18,945 --> 01:26:19,892
Partly my life, and part about--

2806
01:26:19,892 --> 01:26:23,668
- By the way, Andre's wife,
wrote an incredible book.

2807
01:26:23,668 --> 01:26:24,616
- [Erin] I wanna know who she is,

2808
01:26:24,616 --> 01:26:25,449
I didn't wanna bother you about it.

2809
01:26:25,449 --> 01:26:27,101
- She is so fuckin' bad ass.

2810
01:26:27,101 --> 01:26:30,210
- [Andre] She is the real shit.

2811
01:26:30,210 --> 01:26:31,174
- You see how much you like him.

2812
01:26:31,174 --> 01:26:32,007
- [Erin] I heard about his kids.

2813
01:26:32,007 --> 01:26:33,188
- Yeah, but you how much you
like him right now, right.

2814
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:36,353
He's literally a piece of
shit compared to Pheobes.

2815
01:26:36,353 --> 01:26:37,450
- Really?
- He sucks.

2816
01:26:37,450 --> 01:26:38,297
- Absolutely yeah.

2817
01:26:38,297 --> 01:26:40,550
- Like huge mistake having him here.

2818
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:41,491
(all laughing)

2819
01:26:41,491 --> 01:26:42,658
This should have been Pheobe's spot.

2820
01:26:42,658 --> 01:26:43,775
- [Erin] What's Pheobe's thing man?

2821
01:26:43,775 --> 01:26:44,608
What's her name?

2822
01:26:44,608 --> 01:26:47,195
I wanna look her up.
- First of all,

2823
01:26:47,195 --> 01:26:50,570
The thing that I most love about myself,

2824
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:52,117
is that I don't waver.

2825
01:26:52,117 --> 01:26:52,950
(Andre laughing)

2826
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:54,248
I'm being serious, I do not waver

2827
01:26:54,248 --> 01:26:56,647
- I appreciate that.
- Pheobe does not waver.

2828
01:26:56,647 --> 01:26:59,335
Like when I think of the
people I've met in my life,

2829
01:26:59,335 --> 01:27:00,910
in my life!

2830
01:27:00,910 --> 01:27:04,473
And this was a period in
time from 2000, '6, '7, '8

2831
01:27:04,473 --> 01:27:05,632
when we would hang out a bunch.

2832
01:27:05,632 --> 01:27:08,879
Like Pheobe does not waver, I
respect the shit out of that.

2833
01:27:08,879 --> 01:27:10,702
- Yeah, she is who she is.

2834
01:27:10,702 --> 01:27:11,652
- [Mary Kate] That's a good quality.

2835
01:27:11,652 --> 01:27:13,190
- It's a great quality.

2836
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:14,023
- She is like no,

2837
01:27:14,023 --> 01:27:14,856
I don't like that
- You know who wavers a lot?

2838
01:27:14,856 --> 01:27:15,689
Trouty.

2839
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:16,893
(laughs) I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2840
01:27:16,893 --> 01:27:17,750
- [Erin] Whose Trouty?

2841
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:18,785
- Trouty is that guy right there,

2842
01:27:18,785 --> 01:27:19,769
that you haven't noticed yet.

2843
01:27:19,769 --> 01:27:22,979
(all laughing)

2844
01:27:22,979 --> 01:27:25,074
You know what, that's a
perfect way to end this show.

2845
01:27:25,074 --> 01:27:28,734
Guys thank you so much,
Andre, Erin, Mary Kate,

2846
01:27:28,734 --> 01:27:29,567
thank you for being

2847
01:27:29,567 --> 01:27:30,481
the pioneers.
