1
00:00:00,438 --> 00:00:03,826
- Rumors are there was no music.

2
00:00:03,826 --> 00:00:06,114
- [D Rock] I didn't use
the airport Gary music.

3
00:00:06,114 --> 00:00:08,658
- Why would you not use the
airport Gary music when I'm

4
00:00:08,658 --> 00:00:10,825
turning into airport Gary?

5
00:00:14,052 --> 00:00:15,343
- [D Rock] I don't know.

6
00:00:15,343 --> 00:00:16,799
- Oh, that's a good answer.

7
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:18,980
That would be the right answer, right?

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,813
And I appreciate the--

9
00:00:19,813 --> 00:00:20,783
- [D Rock] I'm not going to bullshit it.

10
00:00:20,783 --> 00:00:22,464
- Well, you tend to like to bullshit.

11
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:23,683
- [D Rock] I never bullshit.

12
00:00:23,683 --> 00:00:27,512
- You like to bullshit for
a second here and there.

13
00:00:27,512 --> 00:00:30,646
D rock, this is the
greatest moment of the show.

14
00:00:30,646 --> 00:00:32,985
This is the only part I
will watch the show for.

15
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:34,809
It's your favorite time everybody.

16
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:36,569
As I turn into the greatest superhero

17
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,819
known in entrepreneur land.

18
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:42,632
I'm also the only superhero
in entrepreneur land.

19
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:43,673
For now.

20
00:00:43,673 --> 00:00:46,361
I'm looking for my other
cast of characters so please,

21
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:48,857
in the comments section tell
me which character you're

22
00:00:48,857 --> 00:00:51,016
going to be which is going
to compliment this universe

23
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:54,282
of entrepreneurial superheros
but it's that time again.

24
00:00:54,282 --> 00:00:56,937
Cue the music, D Rock.

25
00:00:56,937 --> 00:01:00,854
(dramatic music) Airport Gary.

26
00:01:05,743 --> 00:01:07,076
This is the 002.

27
00:01:08,089 --> 00:01:09,704
- [Man With Glasses] Yeah.

28
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:10,925
- Pretty cool right?

29
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:12,429
- It's beautiful, yeah I love that.

30
00:01:12,429 --> 00:01:13,262
- [D Rock] It's pretty close

31
00:01:13,262 --> 00:01:14,154
- It's similar, yeah.

32
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:14,987
(laughing)

33
00:01:14,987 --> 00:01:16,846
I mean, that's the style I like.

34
00:01:16,846 --> 00:01:21,132
You know what's funny, I'm
not obsessed with like.

35
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:25,609
I'm not obsessed with forcing
technology when people

36
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:27,049
aren't using it.

37
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:28,793
If Nike doesn't have people
using technology in their

38
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:32,120
sneakers, I surely am not
going to pull that off.

39
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,336
(laughing) You know what I mean?

40
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:34,337
- [D Rock] Yeah.

41
00:01:34,337 --> 00:01:36,327
- To me, I like to react to
what's actually happening

42
00:01:36,327 --> 00:01:40,046
verse force something
that I'd like to happen.

43
00:01:40,046 --> 00:01:42,248
I think it's a crucial
mistake of most businesses

44
00:01:42,248 --> 00:01:46,415
trying to force their
narrative or their ambitions

45
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:50,096
down the consumers' throat
instead of feeding what the

46
00:01:50,096 --> 00:01:51,943
consumer is telling you what they want.

47
00:01:51,943 --> 00:01:53,755
(mumbling)

48
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:54,844
What's that?

49
00:01:54,844 --> 00:01:56,104
(mumbling)

50
00:01:56,104 --> 00:01:58,135
I think it comes from audacity and ego.

51
00:01:58,135 --> 00:02:00,920
(multiple people talking in background)

52
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,224
From human behavior, from
people running companies who

53
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:04,440
think they are big time.

54
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,312
I'm never going to take the
end consumer's attention

55
00:02:06,312 --> 00:02:07,312
for granted.

56
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:09,400
Bye.

57
00:02:16,024 --> 00:02:17,026
- [D Rock] Had to be your first window.

58
00:02:17,026 --> 00:02:18,745
- That's my first window selfie.

59
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:23,104
That's my first window
selfie, but not my last.

60
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,829
- How do you want to inspire people today?

61
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:28,717
- You know, it's funny I
don't really care about

62
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:32,995
anything other than getting
people to do, right?

63
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:36,162
Whether it's something I
say, whether it's my overall

64
00:02:36,162 --> 00:02:40,594
optimism and energy, whether
it's an answer to a question,

65
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:44,482
whether it's my relentless
suffocation of excuses or

66
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:45,634
a tactic.

67
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:49,908
You know, the reason I think
I go very hard on stage is

68
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:52,434
cause I'm trying to find
as many different angle--

69
00:02:52,434 --> 00:02:54,802
everybody responds to
something different, right?

70
00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:56,099
It's not just high energy.

71
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,730
It's not just a thoughtful response.

72
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,547
Sometimes it's even more
subtle things like humility

73
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,644
of saying the customer is always right.

74
00:03:02,644 --> 00:03:06,811
It's not about how, it's
can I get even one person to

75
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,066
fundamentally take advantage.

76
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:11,842
I mean look at what you
and I are doing right now.

77
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:12,759
We're live.

78
00:03:13,922 --> 00:03:15,202
Do you know how much money--

79
00:03:15,202 --> 00:03:19,028
There used to be a huge van
out there with a satellite.

80
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:21,970
I don't think people understand
how amazing the opportunity

81
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,137
is so I'm hopeful to inspire
or force somebody to try

82
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,666
something new.

83
00:03:31,154 --> 00:03:32,866
- You are inspiring me right
now so that's very good.

84
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:34,197
- Thank you, thank you.

85
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:36,533
- Thank you so much for this
two questions and good luck

86
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:37,535
on stage.

87
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:38,937
- Thank you, by everyone.

88
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:40,211
- Thank you so much.

89
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:41,478
- Nice meeting you guys.

90
00:03:41,478 --> 00:03:43,234
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

91
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:44,789
You're welcome (giggling).

92
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:47,122
A blog about to go on stage.

93
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:52,349
You know, just (giggle)
just such a ridiculous life

94
00:03:53,954 --> 00:03:56,502
like so crazy to see
entrepreneurship put on this

95
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:57,522
pedestal.

96
00:03:57,522 --> 00:04:01,202
I never thought I would have
screaming girl fans, D Rock.

97
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:03,586
- [D Rock] Outside a window, that's great.

98
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:05,298
- I mean the window selfie
(mumbling) just like

99
00:04:05,298 --> 00:04:06,300
life's weird.

100
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,133
Good?

101
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,835
- [D Rock] Oslow, get ready.

102
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:14,018
The single best keynote in
the history of this wonderful

103
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:16,754
country is about to be given.

104
00:04:16,754 --> 00:04:17,757
- [Announcer] Let's give
a big warm welcome to

105
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,111
Gary Vaynerchuk.

106
00:04:19,112 --> 00:04:23,346
(audience clapping and cheering)

107
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,586
- That's very nice, thank you so much.

108
00:04:25,586 --> 00:04:28,753
(crowd chanting Gary)

109
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:37,898
I think there's a lot of
misconceptions, assumptions,

110
00:04:37,898 --> 00:04:42,779
curiosities, difficulties for
a lot of B to B marketers,

111
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:45,294
for a lot of entrepreneurs,
for a lot of consumer based

112
00:04:45,294 --> 00:04:46,293
companies.

113
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:48,443
I think it's a very binary debate.

114
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:50,655
I really think that we're in
a place right now where you

115
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:54,523
either believe in what I think
is happening or you don't.

116
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:56,810
And I want everybody to
listen to that sentence

117
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,619
very carefully, not about
what's coming, that's what's

118
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:05,067
about to happen, what's happening
versus believing that or

119
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:06,378
not.

120
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:08,250
I think that people don't
understand how much they are going

121
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,258
to regret when they are older.

122
00:05:11,258 --> 00:05:13,370
I also think a lot of
executives here are going to get

123
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,159
fired in six years for being
conservative even though

124
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,186
that's what their company's
telling them to do.

125
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:21,036
They are going to be the fall
guy and the fall gal when

126
00:05:21,036 --> 00:05:22,541
the company starts faltering.

127
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,555
So, a bunch of people here
are going to be out of a job.

128
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:26,987
They think they're being smart
and a political animal and

129
00:05:26,987 --> 00:05:29,563
they're going to get promoted,
but they don't realize that

130
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:32,011
the market is changing on
them and when everybody looks

131
00:05:32,011 --> 00:05:34,891
at them and they were the
ones pushing bullshit because

132
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:36,897
the company wanted them to pull bullshit.

133
00:05:36,897 --> 00:05:39,163
They're going to get fired and
I don't want that to happen

134
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:40,164
to them.

135
00:05:40,164 --> 00:05:42,126
I'm trying to get them to
die on their sword instead

136
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:43,357
of somebody else's.

137
00:05:43,357 --> 00:05:46,154
And I'm trying to focus on
getting them to tell the truth

138
00:05:46,154 --> 00:05:47,867
instead of what they think
they need to do to get another

139
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:49,200
bonus this year.

140
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:53,474
(audience clapping)

141
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:55,912
Thank you.

142
00:05:55,912 --> 00:05:57,770
And the reason they are clapping
is they know how so true

143
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,035
what I just said was.

144
00:05:59,035 --> 00:06:00,040
(audience laughing)

145
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,954
And your clapping yet
conflicted and I'm empathetic.

146
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:03,955
I don't think I'm cool.

147
00:06:03,955 --> 00:06:04,987
I don't think you're bad.

148
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:07,146
I just wanna have these
conversations so you can be

149
00:06:07,146 --> 00:06:09,467
thoughtful, right?

150
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:11,534
Like maybe it's time to
have the courage to say what

151
00:06:11,534 --> 00:06:13,757
you actually believe because
let me tell you something

152
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:17,931
getting killed on somebody
else's thesis sucks.

153
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:19,706
You'd rather go down with yours.

154
00:06:19,706 --> 00:06:21,323
(audience clapping)

155
00:06:21,323 --> 00:06:22,970
Thank you.

156
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:23,976
Of course.

157
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:24,977
- I'm Demillico.

158
00:06:24,977 --> 00:06:26,891
I follow you since this moment last year.

159
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:28,714
I was like amazing.
- Thank you

160
00:06:28,714 --> 00:06:29,883
- Can we just take a picture?
- Sure

161
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:31,338
So what's the question?

162
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:33,294
- My question is what should I do--?

163
00:06:33,294 --> 00:06:34,970
- You either raise capital
- Yes, sir

164
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,355
- Or you start maximizing
even more margin and just be

165
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,188
patient.

166
00:06:39,034 --> 00:06:40,035
- That's right.

167
00:06:40,035 --> 00:06:41,770
- I mean like Wine Library,
we made no money the first

168
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,958
four years
- Yes, sir

169
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:46,139
- So from 23 to 27, there was nothing.

170
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,995
There was like no margin, none.

171
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:50,139
But enough, enough, enough
you keep reinvesting, you keep

172
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:51,140
reinvesting.

173
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,586
You just got make sure
you're making enough,

174
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:53,882
a little bit more, a little bit more.

175
00:06:53,882 --> 00:06:55,194
That's all.

176
00:06:55,194 --> 00:06:56,539
- So that's what I'll do
- Patience

177
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:57,931
- Very politely, thank you so much.

178
00:06:57,931 --> 00:06:59,596
- You're welcome, take care.
- Pleasure to have you.

179
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:00,906
- Thank you
- Great

180
00:07:00,906 --> 00:07:01,911
- Thank you.

181
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:03,179
Just had a nice chat with my dad.

182
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:04,426
That's always fun.

183
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:06,506
So I should always be
up to some shenanigans.

184
00:07:06,506 --> 00:07:07,853
Some strategies.

185
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:09,179
(mumbling)

186
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,769
- I just caught up on more.

187
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:13,254
When you're an entrepreneur
and you own your own business,

188
00:07:13,254 --> 00:07:15,621
you always have some level of anxiety.

189
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:19,813
With me, it's I talk about
eating shit last line of

190
00:07:19,813 --> 00:07:21,333
defense, always on fire.

191
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:26,293
I'm always thrilled when I'm
in Europe and I give a speech

192
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:30,069
and I get off stage and for
the last 30 minutes I've looked

193
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:32,997
at every email and every text
and nothing's really on fire.

194
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:35,221
I'm in the best spirit right now.

195
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:38,645
This is a rare moment, a very
rare moment where nothing's

196
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:39,749
clearly on fire.

197
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:42,517
There's smoke, don't get me
wrong, there's always smoke, but

198
00:07:42,517 --> 00:07:45,157
I'm in a funny zone right now.

199
00:07:45,157 --> 00:07:48,516
I always like being on
the other side of things.

200
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:52,232
When you're ahead in your
day, and you're work is just

201
00:07:52,232 --> 00:07:54,213
getting revved up.

202
00:07:54,213 --> 00:07:56,003
That's why I'm always thinking
about London, you know,

203
00:07:56,003 --> 00:07:59,236
because it's already in action, so.

204
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:02,627
The update is, I'm super
happy that I only have a bunch

205
00:08:02,627 --> 00:08:06,794
of smoke situations and
nothing five alarm inferno.

206
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:12,927
- Can I get a picture with you?

207
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:13,928
- Sure, how are you?

208
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:15,350
- Good.
- Good.

209
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,623
- I'm Mason.

210
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:18,754
- That's awesome, it's nice to meet you.

211
00:08:18,754 --> 00:08:19,758
(mumbling)

212
00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:21,093
- Nice.
- Awesome.

213
00:08:21,093 --> 00:08:21,926
- Thank you so much.

214
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:23,509
- Great to see you.

215
00:08:25,514 --> 00:08:30,284
Yep you know, fun fact for
a lot of you that don't know

216
00:08:30,284 --> 00:08:31,285
this.

217
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:32,539
I post my own shit.

218
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:33,691
I reply as me.

219
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:36,024
It's me, yep it's really me.

220
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,308
And let me, let me actually
explain why it's really me.

221
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:44,013
Being a practitioner allows
me to be the best strategist,

222
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:45,725
allows me to be the best entrepreneur.

223
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,311
Like you have to do your own
shit, you don't outsource

224
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:48,445
the part that matters.

225
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,797
The part that matters to me is you.

226
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,341
Um, that's how I learn, that's how I know.

227
00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:54,827
It's about listening.

228
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:56,493
I'm talking because I've
been doing so much fucking

229
00:08:56,493 --> 00:08:58,653
listening in parallel.

230
00:08:58,653 --> 00:09:00,236
Always and forever.

231
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:02,240
- I have made it.

232
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,288
It hasn't succeeded, yet.

233
00:09:04,288 --> 00:09:08,095
And I'm just at the point
where I keep losing and losing

234
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,226
and I'm getting lost.

235
00:09:09,226 --> 00:09:11,104
It's not complaining
or anything like that.

236
00:09:11,104 --> 00:09:13,039
- Are you getting discouraged?

237
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,463
- (mumbling) I've been through
that and I've just decided

238
00:09:16,463 --> 00:09:19,777
I'm just going to keep going
and going until I succeed

239
00:09:19,777 --> 00:09:20,991
but basically--

240
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:22,356
- Dude, that's huge.

241
00:09:22,356 --> 00:09:24,335
Why do you think I talk
so much about that?

242
00:09:24,335 --> 00:09:25,416
- Yeah, so basically--

243
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,487
- So everyone wants to be
at number one and if you're

244
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:30,084
number three or seven, so
I'll give you a good piece of

245
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:34,251
advice, if you're smart
enough to get there watch and

246
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,810
you live here?

247
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,747
- No, I just moved to the
UK because my biggest fear.

248
00:09:44,747 --> 00:09:46,554
- Great, great so you're in London.

249
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:47,756
You're in the UK.

250
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:49,385
You look at the landscape.

251
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:52,585
You make a list of 55 number
ones that you've decided.

252
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:55,309
You take a step back and
you watch and you say okay,

253
00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:57,962
here's 55 number ones that I like.

254
00:09:57,962 --> 00:10:00,890
And then you watch, it's
always watching, it's always

255
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,154
listening.

256
00:10:02,154 --> 00:10:03,654
What do they need?

257
00:10:04,602 --> 00:10:07,977
Because the biggest problem
about once you decide that

258
00:10:07,977 --> 00:10:11,530
you're not a number one is
most people don't know how to

259
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,242
approach a number one.

260
00:10:13,242 --> 00:10:15,321
(mumbling)

261
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:17,738
A number one is hard to penetrate.

262
00:10:17,738 --> 00:10:19,774
A number one is a number one for a reason.

263
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:21,930
A number one doesn't need a lot of stuff.

264
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,825
A number one, if you try to
sell them the way you sell

265
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:28,144
everyone else, you lose
before you started.

266
00:10:28,144 --> 00:10:30,137
So, I always say and I don't
know how much you've heard this

267
00:10:30,137 --> 00:10:34,106
I don't always say, but often
I say you gotta watch when I

268
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:37,419
have something whether
it's a sneaker or a book.

269
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:41,132
D Rock, D Rock asked to make
a video for me five times on

270
00:10:41,132 --> 00:10:42,617
email.

271
00:10:42,617 --> 00:10:46,200
The first four times
I didn't even respond.

272
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,104
He didn't.

273
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:50,217
The amount of people that
have emailed me and said hey

274
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:51,430
you need to make more video content.

275
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,111
I normally charge 10,000.

276
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,614
I'll do it for you for 2,000.

277
00:10:54,614 --> 00:10:56,374
Delete, delete.

278
00:10:56,374 --> 00:11:00,134
So, he wanted to do it for
free, he had been watching my

279
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:01,944
content and knew how to make--

280
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:04,759
gave me, said some things
that made me think he could.

281
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:08,870
You know, asked five times
got his chance and then

282
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,998
delivered and then he built
and then stayed patient

283
00:11:12,998 --> 00:11:14,294
when other people when--

284
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:18,059
So the way to hack a number
one is first you have to decide

285
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:19,960
which first number ones you like.

286
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,963
- Yep.

287
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:23,174
- Then you need to see what
he or she is into, what are

288
00:11:23,174 --> 00:11:25,798
their weaknesses or what are
they talking about or how

289
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:28,822
are they acting then figuring
out is that something you can

290
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,902
bring to the table.

291
00:11:30,902 --> 00:11:33,974
And so now you start
with 55, you get a read.

292
00:11:33,974 --> 00:11:36,854
You're down to 12 that whatever
you think you're good at.

293
00:11:36,854 --> 00:11:38,935
The fact that you've already
realized you're not a

294
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:41,366
number one is already you're
willing to be self aware.

295
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:42,550
- Of course yeah

296
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,998
- And then you attack
- Help sales

297
00:11:44,998 --> 00:11:48,636
Just suck at sales (mumbling).

298
00:11:48,636 --> 00:11:52,803
- Or you need a team that
already has sales taken care of.

299
00:11:54,656 --> 00:11:57,744
Because number one
isn't necessarily sales.

300
00:11:57,744 --> 00:12:00,496
- But can I run like another
three and just hire one.

301
00:12:00,496 --> 00:12:01,952
- You could.

302
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:06,672
No, you could run, you
could create a partnership

303
00:12:06,672 --> 00:12:09,208
50/50 with somebody that's
great as sales and you're

304
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,520
great at whatever you
think you're great at.

305
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,522
- Yeah

306
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:14,672
- Or you can work for an
organization where you can learn.

307
00:12:14,672 --> 00:12:18,198
But it's don't just assume
that a number one needs to be

308
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:19,197
great at sales.

309
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,248
Some number ones are not
great at sales, they're great

310
00:12:21,248 --> 00:12:23,811
at management, they're great
at structure, they're great

311
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:25,056
at branding.

312
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:27,122
I would argue that I'm not great at sales.

313
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:31,289
I'm so good at branding
that it trickles into sales

314
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:34,707
but I don't love asking people.

315
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:36,224
I'm very uncomfortable with it.

316
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:37,226
I don't love it.

317
00:12:37,226 --> 00:12:38,231
I can do it.

318
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:39,232
I've done it.

319
00:12:39,232 --> 00:12:40,736
I'm probably good at it.

320
00:12:40,736 --> 00:12:45,131
But, I'd far prefer it come
to me then me come right?

321
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,471
Cause that's how you really sell.

322
00:12:48,471 --> 00:12:50,435
So, those are some thoughts.

323
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:52,018
- Yeah

324
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:53,268
- It's all self awareness brother.

325
00:12:53,268 --> 00:12:54,163
- Yeah yeah yeah.

326
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:56,046
- It's all self awareness,
like of course--

327
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:58,002
(mumbling)

328
00:12:58,002 --> 00:12:59,634
I could have spent the
last, I mean I understand

329
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:04,146
finances but compared to
my brother, my CFO, my dad,

330
00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:07,155
Steven Ross, I am not as good as them.

331
00:13:07,155 --> 00:13:10,531
I don't understand the tax code,
the angles, there are a lot

332
00:13:10,531 --> 00:13:13,362
of things where I lose
money but I'm okay with that

333
00:13:13,362 --> 00:13:15,410
because there's a lot
of things I'm great at.

334
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,577
It's important to understand yourself.

335
00:13:19,443 --> 00:13:22,819
When you are tricking yourself
you get into a bad place.

336
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:24,697
That's why so many people are upset.

337
00:13:24,697 --> 00:13:27,029
They want to be something
instead of figuring out

338
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:28,386
who they are.

339
00:13:28,386 --> 00:13:32,530
They want to be something,
but that's the problem.

340
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,762
They aspire to be something
they've subjectively decided

341
00:13:35,762 --> 00:13:39,929
is cool verses, like listen,
you know how scared I am that

342
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:44,210
my brand getting big and
everybody and I don't want

343
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,082
anyone to be me.

344
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:49,593
I'm very unique in my
background and upbringing.

345
00:13:49,593 --> 00:13:51,507
There can be people that are me.

346
00:13:51,507 --> 00:13:53,971
I want them to be like me in
the fact that I'm fully me

347
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:56,258
and then you need to be fully you.

348
00:13:56,258 --> 00:14:00,466
The other thing is too many
people think that, people

349
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:03,395
don't understand that
money is not that play.

350
00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:05,202
Like, I say it all the time.

351
00:14:05,202 --> 00:14:07,285
137,000 is a ton, 50,000.

352
00:14:08,853 --> 00:14:11,986
You can have a very happy life for 50,000

353
00:14:11,986 --> 00:14:14,646
especially if you're at
peace in your mind and you

354
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:18,969
love being a janitor,
a secretary, an admin,

355
00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:20,435
people are getting confused.

356
00:14:20,435 --> 00:14:22,001
They are getting confused.

357
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:25,470
They want stuff that doesn't matter.

358
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,901
They want stuff that doesn't matter.

359
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:28,902
It's a whirlwind.

360
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:29,735
Whoa.

361
00:14:30,622 --> 00:14:32,814
I have no idea how I.

362
00:14:32,814 --> 00:14:33,998
I don't know how I did.

363
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:34,998
- [D Rock] That we're keeping.

364
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:36,884
- Of course we're keeping
that's the best part of this

365
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:37,890
whole vlog.

366
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:38,912
I didn't drop it.

367
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:41,249
Good day so far going to
an influencer meet up and

368
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:42,958
then I'm going to sleep for
two hours and watch the Jets

369
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,277
stomp the Bills and then
we've got a long day tomorrow.

370
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:51,444
Copenhagen, Moscow, LA, four
cities in Australia, it's

371
00:14:53,408 --> 00:14:54,429
pretty crazy out here.

372
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:57,622
Then we got this group,
weird art freaking us out.

373
00:14:57,622 --> 00:14:59,294
Watch this.

374
00:14:59,294 --> 00:15:00,862
She's about to scare the shit out of you.

375
00:15:00,862 --> 00:15:01,867
There it was.

376
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:02,870
Yep, they move.

377
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,573
Yeah, build the biggest
building in town without

378
00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:05,823
tearing down everyone else's building.

379
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:07,714
I think that that's a
very big thing for me.

380
00:15:07,714 --> 00:15:09,966
I've always started saying
things like winners win.

381
00:15:09,966 --> 00:15:11,823
You're not going to stop a winner.

382
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:15,120
I'm just surprised by how much
time and energy people spend

383
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,615
on trying to make somebody
they're competing with like

384
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:20,208
lose by them talking
bad behind their back.

385
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,888
You know, that's how I'm winning.

386
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:23,604
You know I have a lot of
competitors who spend their

387
00:15:23,604 --> 00:15:26,768
entire dinner with a
client talking about me.

388
00:15:26,768 --> 00:15:28,292
(groovy music)

389
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:29,457
That's when you win.

390
00:15:29,457 --> 00:15:32,053
Like I'm not worried about
anybody else and so my weirdly

391
00:15:32,053 --> 00:15:34,976
hope that everybody, I'm
pumped that Chris Soca made

392
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,552
more money when we
invested at the same time.

393
00:15:37,552 --> 00:15:38,555
He deserved it.

394
00:15:38,555 --> 00:15:39,558
He was more right.

395
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:41,200
I don't begrudge that.

396
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,496
I applaud it.

397
00:15:42,496 --> 00:15:45,743
If anyone beats me ever,
and as long as it's fair,

398
00:15:45,743 --> 00:15:47,983
well then I think that's the best.

399
00:15:47,983 --> 00:15:52,000
It keeps me grounded, hungry,
and I also am genuinely

400
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,487
happy for somebody else.

401
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:56,015
I, look, there's so much
money and opportunity in the

402
00:15:56,015 --> 00:16:00,336
system, nobody is stopping
you from getting yours.

403
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:03,536
If you think some guy or some
gal is winning and that's

404
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:04,993
coming out of your pocket, you suck.

405
00:16:04,993 --> 00:16:08,533
If I can create successful
entrepreneurs and they create

406
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:11,104
successful entrepreneurs
like I, I think I'm putting

407
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,280
such good into the world.

408
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,280
I think you become a platform.

409
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,327
I think you can't be a platform
when you're bad because

410
00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:18,672
you're selfish.

411
00:16:18,672 --> 00:16:21,935
You're closed by nature,
but I feel like I'm open

412
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:24,176
source entrepreneurship.

413
00:16:24,176 --> 00:16:25,408
I'm free.

414
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:27,743
And I'm putting out my
best shit, and I'm great.

415
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:30,496
And I'm putting out my
best shit daily for free.

416
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:35,151
And so in a weird way I'm
more similar to open source

417
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:37,343
like I'm not keeping my best
ideas to myself so I can keep

418
00:16:37,343 --> 00:16:38,774
the money.

419
00:16:38,774 --> 00:16:40,982
I'm trying to empower.

420
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:41,985
I want people to win.

421
00:16:41,985 --> 00:16:42,987
Jordan, right?

422
00:16:42,987 --> 00:16:44,272
I wanted Jordan to be successful
and now he's a successful

423
00:16:44,272 --> 00:16:46,511
fitness personality and
that helps other people and

424
00:16:46,511 --> 00:16:48,178
dit dit dit dit dah.

425
00:16:49,151 --> 00:00:00,000
(soothing music)
