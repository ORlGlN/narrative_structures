1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,000
rich asks what advice do you have for

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,279
professors to engage college students in

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,230
the classroom what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about outside of</font>

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,710
class which is the biggest thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,540
and any professor out there or if you're

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,570
asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for somebody is that professors</font>

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,550
aren't relevant to a lot of their

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,740
students today more than ever because

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,170
the behaviors of how we act aren't map

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,689
and meaning so many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have emailed</font>

11
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:26,730
me like literally because the show

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,130
emailed me that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey I'm in class right</font>

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,590
now and what my professors talking about

14
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,930
makes no sense compared to I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching</font>

15
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,340
your palm listening to your podcast

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,680
right now while my professors talking

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,020
because he or she r so I literally

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,149
professors in major universities that

19
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:43,950
are putting kids in debt right now are

20
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,020
telling them that there is no roi in

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,289
social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Ludacris horse crap on</font>

22
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,410
this crap kick anyway I think the

23
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">biggest thing a professor can do is to</font>

24
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">be relevant with them if you're a</font>

25
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:58,289
professor right now and especially if

26
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,000
you're marketing your<font color="#E5E5E5"> comms professor</font>

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,399
right now and you're not jamming on Yik

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,250
yak and snapchat and the insta then

29
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,720
you're making a huge mistake<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,820
you're out of touch<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your sins</font>

31
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,890
you're saying dumb like hey kids

32
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,600
hey students we're going to connect

33
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,030
through modern things like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like</font>

34
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,400
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't even come out of my mouth</font>

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,979
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> so disgusted with what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

36
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,470
universities across this country and so

37
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,080
its relevance there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a rolling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

38
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,240
checking the out going on in

39
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,860
classrooms all across this country and

40
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,560
it's sad because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the romance of how</font>

41
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,259
professors think it should be versus the

42
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,130
reality of what it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh crap wait</font>

43
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,140

44
