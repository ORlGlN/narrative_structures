00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,180
the impact you've made on people you've

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,590
touched and inspired over the years

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">Carlos thank you so much for that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">been following my career for quite a</font>

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,250
while<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we interact quite a bit and I</font>

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,260
think I'm more tangibly untouchable than

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,820
a lot of the other kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people that</font>

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,529
look like me and we engage quite a bit

12
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:26,880
and I have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of context back to</font>

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,890
question number one in comparison to

14
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,720
others and all that blah blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,500
the truth is most of them really really

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,030
really know me and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that you know</font>

say he loves and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to buy the Jets</font>

21
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:47,250
more than anything and thus the money

22
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,020
associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that process is very</font>

23
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,410
important to him it is a distant second

24
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,670
to know that I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been gifted with a</font>

25
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">communication style that touches people</font>

26
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,510
that makes them you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

27
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,620
saying the same thing they've heard

28
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,530
before it's either my conviction or it

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,559
comes to my soul in such a way I talk

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,479
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I believe in so much that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> affected even in small</font>

37
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,830
ways creating more positivity for some

38
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,509
people there's just so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> variables of</font>

39
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,759

44
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,920
essence of Who I am as a human being and

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,509
it is the singular thing that I'm most

46
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:41,250
proud of and it gives me enormous

47
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,799
confidence of what kind of parent I'm

48
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,630
going to be and that makes me very very
