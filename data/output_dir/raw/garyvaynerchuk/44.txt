1
00:00:00,137 --> 00:00:02,065
- What I really hope,
and I felt that listening

2
00:00:02,065 --> 00:00:05,252
to those two incredible
leaders in our company,

3
00:00:05,252 --> 00:00:08,203
is we've got a real, we've
got a real fuckin' shot.

4
00:00:08,203 --> 00:00:11,203
(bouncy rock music)

5
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:16,492
Good morning, vlog.

6
00:00:16,492 --> 00:00:17,770
Hey Iris.
- Hey!

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:18,603
- I can go this way 'cause

8
00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:20,719
I don't know about the light.
- Sure.

9
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:22,661
- Vlog, I've had an epiphany

10
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:23,745
and I want to share it with you.

11
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:25,288
I've been thinking a lot about something

12
00:00:25,288 --> 00:00:27,445
which is the way I think about business

13
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:30,408
and this is gonna help a
lot of you which excites me.

14
00:00:30,408 --> 00:00:31,280
And I miss you guys.

15
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,728
It's been a whole lot
of hodge-podge recalls

16
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:35,676
and all that, obviously with
the holidays and everything

17
00:00:35,676 --> 00:00:37,676
so it's good to be back.

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,443
There's two ways to sell a product.

19
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:44,970
There's branding and
marketing, and there's sales,

20
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,715
and all of you jump into
one or two buckets, right?

21
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,051
Like you really understand
the long marathon

22
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:51,923
of building a brand.

23
00:00:51,923 --> 00:00:55,589
It's a lot about influencers,
awareness, its content,

24
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,334
and then a lot of you are
really great math kids,

25
00:00:57,334 --> 00:01:00,988
and it's like Amazon affiliates and Google

26
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:04,723
and quant-based math like CAC, LTV.

27
00:01:04,723 --> 00:01:07,181
CAC: Customer Acquisitions Costs.

28
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:08,642
LTV: Lifetime Value.

29
00:01:08,642 --> 00:01:10,309
Math kids, art kids.

30
00:01:11,175 --> 00:01:14,260
Anthropology kids, quant kids.

31
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,198
And that's how I think about business.

32
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:19,095
And then I realized, holy shit,

33
00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:22,427
that is what is going
on with me and content.

34
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:24,681
A lot of people producing content

35
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:27,177
for a short-term ROI, right?

36
00:01:27,177 --> 00:01:31,328
They do a vlog 'cause
they wanna sell something,

37
00:01:31,328 --> 00:01:34,161
whether it's merchandise or eBooks

38
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,999
or things of that nature

39
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:40,282
and everybody wants to sell

40
00:01:40,282 --> 00:01:42,437
and I wanna sell my legacy.

41
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:43,937
I want reputation.

42
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:47,876
I want, you know, a lot
of the dirty stuff I do,

43
00:01:47,876 --> 00:01:49,291
meeting with you one-on-one,

44
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,827
DM'ing you, it's not ROI positive.

45
00:01:52,827 --> 00:01:53,949
I get a lot of accolades,

46
00:01:53,949 --> 00:01:56,486
like Gary replied, Gary
cares, Gary called me,

47
00:01:56,486 --> 00:01:58,842
Gary gave me a chance, Gary met with me.

48
00:01:58,842 --> 00:02:00,474
And I realize my behavior there

49
00:02:00,474 --> 00:02:03,512
is because my north star is legacy.

50
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:04,677
Reputation.

51
00:02:04,677 --> 00:02:06,502
What do you say behind my back?

52
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:08,876
A lot of you first get a hold of me

53
00:02:08,876 --> 00:02:10,341
and you're like, I don't
know about this guy.

54
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:14,873
And I win in the long-term
over and over and over again

55
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:17,322
because intent and the truth always win

56
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:22,255
and my intent and my truth
is I'm going for legacy.

57
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:23,816
Like, the money's gonna come along like,

58
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:26,424
you know, there's a big,
interesting thing about me:

59
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:29,091
I made my family a lot of money.

60
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:33,671
I always knew how to make money.

61
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:35,465
Vayner Media was a foregone conclusion.

62
00:02:35,465 --> 00:02:40,361
This is a 150-175 million
dollar holding company now

63
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:42,903
with Purewow and Vayner Media, Vayner X.

64
00:02:42,903 --> 00:02:44,848
Vayner Sports is a foregone conclusion.

65
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:46,187
That company will make money.

66
00:02:46,187 --> 00:02:48,766
It's gonna do that by legacy.

67
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:51,592
We're gonna take care of our kids better.

68
00:02:51,592 --> 00:02:53,921
Which is gonna cost us
money in the short-term.

69
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:55,415
I'm holding my breath.

70
00:02:55,415 --> 00:02:58,322
I'm not worried about
money in the short-term

71
00:02:58,322 --> 00:03:02,905
and so I'm acting in my
content in the intent of legacy

72
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:07,251
and that is how I'm filtering things

73
00:03:07,251 --> 00:03:09,603
and that's how I'm looking
at what you're doing.

74
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:13,764
Are you looking for
long-term legacy and brand,

75
00:03:13,764 --> 00:03:15,971
which then will bring you dollars?

76
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:19,076
Or are you looking for
dollars in the short-term?

77
00:03:19,076 --> 00:03:22,531
Do you love the process
of building that brand

78
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:25,682
or do you hate it and you're
just working for the dollar?

79
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:28,052
And it's just this very obvious thing now

80
00:03:28,052 --> 00:03:30,385
and I never put it really deeply

81
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:33,129
into the content part of what I'm doing.

82
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,029
Because content, a lot of times,

83
00:03:35,029 --> 00:03:36,113
is always been about branding,

84
00:03:36,113 --> 00:03:37,815
but I've realized as I've
analyzed a lot of you

85
00:03:37,815 --> 00:03:40,586
is your content is actually sales content.

86
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:44,002
Like, you don't really care
about what you're putting out.

87
00:03:44,002 --> 00:03:45,921
You don't really care.

88
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:50,921
It's being done for something
in return in the short-term

89
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:54,100
and I think that's a huge fucking mistake.

90
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,658
And so when I say, "Close
your eyes until you're 29."

91
00:03:56,658 --> 00:03:59,389
Like I did the other day, or 39 or 49

92
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:02,636
or when I say, "You're 44, you have time."

93
00:04:02,636 --> 00:04:03,833
It's because I believe it.

94
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,750
I believe that you're 44 years old,

95
00:04:09,575 --> 00:04:12,486
you are not happy with your
job or things of that nature

96
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,647
and I just genuinely,
you know it's so crazy.

97
00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:18,101
Like, I'm looking at this like...

98
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:19,435
I wrote this.

99
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:22,306
This came out in 2009, I think, right?

100
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:25,336
And I wrote it in 2008, so
I wrote it 10 years ago.

101
00:04:25,336 --> 00:04:26,869
It's a small, little fuckin' book,

102
00:04:26,869 --> 00:04:29,206
and obviously I'm writing
the follow-up now,

103
00:04:29,206 --> 00:04:30,958
but it's the punchline, man.

104
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,007
If you do the right thing,

105
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:35,316
over what I think is a
long-term to a lot of you,

106
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,040
five, six years, you'll win.

107
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,873
You'll win.

108
00:04:38,873 --> 00:04:41,982
And so, live your life in a way,

109
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:44,416
put yourself in a position
where you don't need money.

110
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,499
Meaning, you don't need stuff, right?

111
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:52,961
Or even if you have debt,
or it sucks right now,

112
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:54,951
put yourself into a cocoon and say,

113
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:55,784
"It doesn't matter.

114
00:04:55,784 --> 00:04:57,714
"It's gonna suck for another 36 months

115
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,870
"and then it's gonna get better."

116
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,703
These short-term moves are just...

117
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:07,395
Everybody is just, like, trying
to close on the first move.

118
00:05:07,395 --> 00:05:08,889
And it never works.

119
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,093
Not in the long-term.

120
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:15,629
Negativity and tactics
win in the short-term.

121
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:20,582
Positivity and merit and the
stake win in the long-term.

122
00:05:20,582 --> 00:05:22,785
And there's confusion in the system

123
00:05:22,785 --> 00:05:25,063
and I will systematically,
for the rest of my life,

124
00:05:25,063 --> 00:05:29,660
try to unwind it and get
people un-fucking confused.

125
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,533
- [Iris] I feel that.

126
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:31,366
- Cool.

127
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:33,935
- [Iris] I need to hear
that, too, for my own self.

128
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:35,887
- It's true, right?
- Yeah, It's so true.

129
00:05:35,887 --> 00:05:38,604
Even for my content that I'm creating--

130
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:41,017
- Hold on, hold on, this
is what the vlog's about.

131
00:05:41,017 --> 00:05:41,850
- Okay.
- Great.

132
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,988
So, we're still rolling.

133
00:05:42,988 --> 00:05:43,987
- What's up?

134
00:05:43,987 --> 00:05:45,637
- [Gary] Go ahead, Iris, what do you say?

135
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,669
Why were you just saying that?

136
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:47,532
- There you go.
- Thank you.

137
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:49,241
- [Gary] Not that I know
what to do with this shit.

138
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:51,066
- My YouTube stuff I make personally.

139
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:52,981
- [Gary] I'm aware.

140
00:05:52,981 --> 00:05:56,251
- Just like, thinking about...

141
00:05:56,251 --> 00:05:58,790
Even the titles, for
example, on my channel.

142
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,762
just creating things that are
really true to you, that's--

143
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,775
- Instead of--
- Makes you feel better, too.

144
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,890
- [Gary] So you're saying,
I'm gonna title something.

145
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,264
- Like yesterday, for example.
- Please.

146
00:06:08,264 --> 00:06:09,920
- I made a video for my own channel--

147
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,758
- [Gary] Yes.

148
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:12,170
- And it didn't feel right, 'cause like--

149
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,212
- [Gary] 'Cause you felt
like you were doing it

150
00:06:13,212 --> 00:06:14,094
to grow your channel.

151
00:06:14,094 --> 00:06:14,971
- Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah.

152
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:16,592
- So I changed it right there.
- Yeah!

153
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:19,358
- And I just made something
that I just felt right

154
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:22,013
and I just felt so much
better and you just,

155
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:25,100
I realized just being with
you is about creating content

156
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,425
that is true to you that you
want to share with the world.

157
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:29,038
- [Gary] Right, so you
see me always pushing down

158
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:30,802
on these characters when they're trying,

159
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:32,879
like D-Rock, especially, is bad at this.

160
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,589
He's always trying to
do things to win YouTube

161
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:38,123
because he wants to win YouTube,

162
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:40,240
and I'm always like, "Fuck you."

163
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,199
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

164
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,366
- [Gary] Fuck you, D-Rock.

165
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:50,409
Hold on, hold on, let me just get it.

166
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,489
Now, look, now hold on.

167
00:06:52,489 --> 00:06:53,574
Fuck, how do you guys do this?

168
00:06:53,574 --> 00:06:55,526
Okay, good, hold on.

169
00:06:55,526 --> 00:06:56,359
Don't worry, Iris, I got it.

170
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:57,734
I'll figure it out.
- Alright.

171
00:06:57,734 --> 00:06:59,901
- [Gary] Fuck you, D-Rock.

172
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,346
Bobby Babin, you liked that, huh?

173
00:07:03,346 --> 00:07:04,436
- It's so great, yeah.

174
00:07:04,436 --> 00:07:05,531
- [Gary] Is that your favorite?

175
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:07,051
- Basically.

176
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:10,256
- [Gary] Did you also learn
that when you do the true thing

177
00:07:10,256 --> 00:07:12,286
and the right thing, that
content will always do better?

178
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:15,313
Not like, the hack or the thing?

179
00:07:15,313 --> 00:07:17,759
D-Rock always wants to do
the hack for YouTube, right?

180
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,592
- It's just being honest.

181
00:07:18,592 --> 00:07:21,588
- [Gary] Seth, you agree,
D-Rock is weird with YouTube.

182
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:22,795
- Always trying to hack it.
- Yeah.

183
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:25,221
D-Rock, why are you always
trying to hack YouTube?

184
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:27,502
- I'm just trying to make
the best content possible.

185
00:07:27,502 --> 00:07:28,417
- [Gary] Do you believe that?

186
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:29,667
- Yeah.

187
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:30,875
- [Gary] Alex, do you believe that?

188
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:31,708
- (laughs) No.

189
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,458
(group laughing)

190
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:41,024
("Over and Over" by Sample and Hold)

191
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:44,233
- Vlog, this is the most important part

192
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:46,601
where Tyler and I make
sure everything happens

193
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:48,941
that needs to happen.

194
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:50,784
- Gary, what's up?
- What's up, man, how are you?

195
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:53,774
- How's it going?
- Such a pleasure, come on in.

196
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,524
This gives me energy.

197
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:58,627
This gives me the energy that I need.

198
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:02,544
(slow electronic groove music)

199
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:12,728
I think they all know it's true.

200
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:16,645
(slow electronic groove music)

201
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:25,742
Going to a meeting.

202
00:08:25,742 --> 00:08:29,659
(slow electronic groove music)

203
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:37,395
Are we gonna be really late?

204
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:38,645
- Yeah.
- Fuck.

205
00:08:39,748 --> 00:08:41,600
Av, any way you can fly real quick?

206
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,259
Like, can you hit that button?

207
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:46,262
I know that there's other
people in the room here now

208
00:08:46,262 --> 00:08:48,458
and it's weird to show
them that feature, but.

209
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,708
(laughing)

210
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,730
Ugh, I hate being late more than anything.

211
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,313
(slow techno groove music)

212
00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:04,274
Vlog, what's up?

213
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:06,354
Back in the car, been
running late all day.

214
00:09:06,354 --> 00:09:07,890
Heading out to LA today on business

215
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,169
and have a company-wide all
hands on meeting coming up

216
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:14,561
to go through some of the
nuances of the business.

217
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:16,862
And so, stressed out a little bit.

218
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:18,647
Got a new pod sessions.

219
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:19,771
If you're not listening to podcasts

220
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:21,100
you're making a huge mistake

221
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,296
and this new concept, Pod
Sessions, kinda like taking off

222
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:26,499
the jam sessions that me and my homies did

223
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,951
in the early days of Web 2.0.

224
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:31,992
Grabbing three people from
random different backgrounds,

225
00:09:31,992 --> 00:09:33,655
putting them together,
putting them on the podcast,

226
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:35,108
and shooting the shit,
so I'm excited about

227
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,310
doing that first one today.

228
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,763
Introduce you to three new people

229
00:09:38,763 --> 00:09:41,799
and just got done with
a meeting with a client,

230
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:44,171
sitting in this traffic with Av.

231
00:09:44,171 --> 00:09:45,671
Av, what's the ETA now?

232
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:46,965
- [Av] It's saying 21 minutes now.

233
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:47,798
- Fuck!

234
00:09:49,729 --> 00:09:50,646
That's bad.

235
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,133
That was 18 minutes five minutes ago,

236
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:56,300
so something bad happened.

237
00:09:58,115 --> 00:10:01,808
Running late to meetings is literally

238
00:10:01,808 --> 00:10:04,467
the worst feeling I have.

239
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:07,550
("Lagoon" by J.A.K.)

240
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:27,835
Can this room kinda do me
a favor and just spread out

241
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,835
and get everybody 'cause I'm coming?

242
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,297
Good afternoon, Vayner Media.

243
00:10:34,297 --> 00:10:36,920
Thank you so much, I'm
sorry I'm a little bit late.

244
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,744
First and foremost, I
want to wish everybody

245
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:42,652
a healthy and happy 2018
and hope everyone enjoyed

246
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:43,732
their time off.

247
00:10:43,732 --> 00:10:46,230
It seems like a million years
ago, I'm sure, for all of you.

248
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,392
I've seen the hustle in every avenue.

249
00:10:49,392 --> 00:10:53,452
The things that we are focused
on, as an organization,

250
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:57,143
are clearly resonating
with the marketplace.

251
00:10:57,143 --> 00:10:59,644
I think a lot of what the
second bullet's about,

252
00:10:59,644 --> 00:11:02,840
the way I think about
our continued obsession

253
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,784
of long form video or video,
not even necessarily long form,

254
00:11:06,784 --> 00:11:09,745
for mobile devices or people
are paying attention to

255
00:11:09,745 --> 00:11:14,328
are enormous momentum around
voice and what is going on

256
00:11:15,648 --> 00:11:18,315
in Alexa Google home environment.

257
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:20,764
I think what I'm most proud of

258
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:24,828
is Vayner Media obviously is pigeonholed

259
00:11:24,828 --> 00:11:28,307
still with many people
as a social media shop,

260
00:11:28,307 --> 00:11:31,667
because any client service
company in the world,

261
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:34,463
in any sector, is pigeonholed often

262
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:37,703
into the services they provide early on.

263
00:11:37,703 --> 00:11:39,942
There's just a lot of good going on,

264
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:44,940
and as I look at the macro
issues and opportunities at hand

265
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,431
for the biggest brands in the world,

266
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:49,719
I think we will be on
right side of history.

267
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:53,412
I'd love to hear a massive
clap for two of the most

268
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,464
essential parts of our company.

269
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,964
(applauding and cheering)

270
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,362
Justine and Andrea.

271
00:12:02,362 --> 00:12:04,132
- I'm so excited to be here

272
00:12:04,132 --> 00:12:05,670
and I think Justine and
I both want to share

273
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,210
a little bit about why we
joined your organization

274
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,911
and what we're up to.

275
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:12,591
So, Justine, you're going to kick it off.

276
00:12:12,591 --> 00:12:15,362
- So I'll just call out from
the get-go, I am Australian.

277
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:18,591
(audience laughing)

278
00:12:18,591 --> 00:12:22,570
I joined six months ago and
it has been a wild ride,

279
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,283
and I've loved every minute of it.

280
00:12:24,283 --> 00:12:26,607
It very much came across
to me that Vayner's at this

281
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:28,512
incredible inflection point.

282
00:12:28,512 --> 00:12:30,301
For all of the sixth sense that you've had

283
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:31,754
in the last eight years,

284
00:12:31,754 --> 00:12:36,354
it's like this bubbling
energy of what's come next.

285
00:12:36,354 --> 00:12:40,669
And we're getting asked
to go and speak to clients

286
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:42,416
about being their AOR.

287
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,744
And that's a pretty epic feat

288
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:47,021
for a company not only of this size

289
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:49,854
but also this young in its genesis

290
00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:53,296
And I think that opportunity is something

291
00:12:53,296 --> 00:12:54,170
I'm really excited about

292
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,242
'cause I know that strategy can help.

293
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,660
So, thank you all for the warm welcome.

294
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,963
I'm looking forward to
getting to know you.

295
00:12:59,963 --> 00:13:01,631
(audience applauding)

296
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:05,122
- So, I'm one of the proud
members of the inaugural group

297
00:13:05,122 --> 00:13:07,035
that took class of 2018.

298
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:07,905
(whistling)

299
00:13:07,905 --> 00:13:10,094
Give it up for the, we've
got like 10 of us out there.

300
00:13:10,094 --> 00:13:13,594
(cheering and applauding)

301
00:13:15,148 --> 00:13:17,190
I know more about them

302
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,228
than I do about some of my family members.

303
00:13:19,228 --> 00:13:21,478
(laughing)

304
00:13:23,944 --> 00:13:27,805
Hopefully some of that
is kept in confidence.

305
00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:29,181
I'm so fired up to be here

306
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:31,974
and I love the program that
the People Experience team

307
00:13:31,974 --> 00:13:33,927
have delivered so far

308
00:13:33,927 --> 00:13:37,113
and I have to say, I came
into this organization

309
00:13:37,113 --> 00:13:39,334
with really high expectations

310
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:42,024
and if the past 10 days are anything like

311
00:13:42,024 --> 00:13:44,357
what the experience is
gonna be going forward,

312
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:45,937
having not only spent
a little time in here

313
00:13:45,937 --> 00:13:49,302
but being out in CES where
we were interacting with

314
00:13:49,302 --> 00:13:52,135
some of the top CEOs in the world,

315
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:55,874
we are so positioned in the right time

316
00:13:55,874 --> 00:13:57,739
for what the industry needs.

317
00:13:57,739 --> 00:13:59,447
And it's our provocative point of view

318
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:01,850
combined with the energy of our people

319
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,413
that is gonna just nail it.

320
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:06,812
To echo what everyone is
saying in terms of open door,

321
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,052
I'm gonna try to ledger
it up just one more notch.

322
00:14:09,052 --> 00:14:10,796
I'm gonna put candy in my office.

323
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:12,403
(laughing)

324
00:14:12,403 --> 00:14:14,073
I am just down the road from Justine

325
00:14:14,073 --> 00:14:17,194
and in between Steve and Justine,

326
00:14:17,194 --> 00:14:19,612
but, please, so many
of you have reached out

327
00:14:19,612 --> 00:14:21,062
and it means the world to me.

328
00:14:21,062 --> 00:14:23,638
Hope you guys are ready,
buckle up, for 2018.

329
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:25,715
I guess Gary might have
your two more minutes.

330
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:26,709
- Yeah, cool.

331
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:29,126
(applauding)

332
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:45,271
The candy thing made me feel
like I wanna one up it, so.

333
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:47,176
(laughing)

334
00:14:47,176 --> 00:14:49,715
Going forward, I have free cash

335
00:14:49,715 --> 00:14:52,076
(laughing)
in my office

336
00:14:52,076 --> 00:14:54,166
so hopefully you guys will take me up

337
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,373
on the open door policy.

338
00:14:55,373 --> 00:14:56,554
(laughing)

339
00:14:56,554 --> 00:14:57,633
- [Employee] How much?

340
00:14:57,633 --> 00:14:58,766
- A lot!

341
00:14:58,766 --> 00:15:01,727
(laughing)

342
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:02,977
Look, you know,

343
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:07,468
this is super interesting because, for me,

344
00:15:07,468 --> 00:15:10,380
so much of what has brought
me happiness in my life,

345
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,423
personally and professionally,

346
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:14,178
has been predicated on
whether it's intuition

347
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:15,430
or pattern recognition,

348
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,919
it's having a good sense
of what's about to happen

349
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,622
and then building towards it.

350
00:15:19,622 --> 00:15:22,699
You know, what I really hope, and I felt

351
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:26,340
listening to those two incredible
leaders in our company,

352
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,090
is we've got a real fuckin' shot.

353
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:31,048
Yeah, that's a good way to end.

354
00:15:31,048 --> 00:15:31,923
I love you, guys.

355
00:15:31,923 --> 00:15:34,340
(applauding)

356
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:37,726
Have a good day.

357
00:15:37,726 --> 00:15:38,559
Hit me up.

358
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,239
Hey Vlog, just did a great

360
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:46,991
Bobby Glen in the house,

361
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:47,824
Hussein that was a big shout out for you.

00:15:47,824 --> 00:15:49,068

Headed to LA, good day.

365
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:54,212
We got that rant earlier today,

366
00:15:54,212 --> 00:15:55,709
you'll take some pieces from this.

367
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:57,662
You'll use somebody to
help you edit it properly.

368
00:15:57,662 --> 00:15:58,778
