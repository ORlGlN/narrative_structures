1
00:00:00,895 --> 00:00:02,218
- Yo, what up, what up, what up, what up?

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:03,119
Big love.

3
00:00:03,119 --> 00:00:05,855
I'm super fuckin' fired up
that you guys finally get

4
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:06,754
to watch this entire thing.

5
00:00:06,754 --> 00:00:10,420
Some of you have seen clips,
Daily V quotes on Instagram,

6
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,253
but man Nipsey Hussle.

7
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:15,146
When you talk about
authenticity in the game

8
00:00:15,146 --> 00:00:19,176
whether it's entrepreneurship,
sports, music, teaching,

9
00:00:19,176 --> 00:00:20,077
parenting.

10
00:00:20,077 --> 00:00:23,341
I'm always so respectful of it.

11
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:28,015
It's so interesting to me and
the admiration that I have

12
00:00:28,015 --> 00:00:31,765
for the authenticity of
Nipsey is incredible.

13
00:00:32,652 --> 00:00:34,297
We talk a lot about the themes

14
00:00:34,297 --> 00:00:36,453
that you're seeing me
play out about my belief

15
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,537
in culture and hip hop and business

16
00:00:38,537 --> 00:00:41,120
and I hope you enjoy this clip,

17
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:46,508
this incredible session as I'll call it,

18
00:00:46,508 --> 00:00:49,131
as much as I did in living it.

19
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:51,964
(energetic music)

20
00:01:00,423 --> 00:01:03,006
(door opening)

21
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:05,744
- [Gary] Hey, man.

22
00:01:05,744 --> 00:01:06,645
Gary.

23
00:01:06,645 --> 00:01:07,544
- Nice to meet you, man.

24
00:01:07,544 --> 00:01:08,448
- [Gary] Nice to meet you, man.

25
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:09,365
- [Male] How you doing?

26
00:01:09,365 --> 00:01:10,246
Bean-o.

27
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:11,164
- [Gary] Bean-o, Gary.

28
00:01:11,164 --> 00:01:12,072
- Good to meet you.

29
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:12,961
- [Gary] What up, man?

30
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:13,874
- [Bean-o] How are you doing, man?

31
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:14,774
- [Male] I'm doing alright.

32
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:15,607
(men chattering)

33
00:01:15,607 --> 00:01:16,440
- [Nipsey] What's up, bro?

34
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,273
How you feelin'?

35
00:01:17,273 --> 00:01:18,106
- [Gary] Gary, real good, man.

36
00:01:18,106 --> 00:01:18,939
- [Nipsey] Good to meet you.

37
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:19,772
- [Gary] Real good.

38
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:20,605
- [Nipsey] This is Sophie.

39
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:21,438
Thank you for the hospitality.

40
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:22,271
- [Nipsey] Yeah, absolutely.

41
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:23,104
- Nice to meet you, Sophie.

42
00:01:23,104 --> 00:01:23,937
- [Gary] Sophie?

43
00:01:23,937 --> 00:01:24,770
Gary.

44
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:25,603
Nice to meet you, Sophie.

45
00:01:25,603 --> 00:01:26,436
- That's my engineer, G.

46
00:01:26,436 --> 00:01:27,269
- G.

47
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:28,105
- Hey, how you doing?

48
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:29,010
- Gary, pleasure.

49
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:29,902
- [Nipsey] This is Fall-ey.

50
00:01:29,902 --> 00:01:30,813
- Fall-ey.

51
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:31,713
- How you doing, man?

52
00:01:31,713 --> 00:01:32,614
- What's up man?

53
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:33,514
Gary.

54
00:01:33,514 --> 00:01:34,418
My pleasure.

55
00:01:34,418 --> 00:01:35,378
- Tiggy.

56
00:01:35,378 --> 00:01:36,276
- Tiggy, what up, my man.

57
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:37,175
How are you?

58
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:38,008
Gary.

59
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:38,841
(men chattering)

60
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:39,674
- [Nipsey] So I hope the weed
smoke don't bother y'all.

61
00:01:39,674 --> 00:01:40,507
- [Gary] Never.

62
00:01:40,507 --> 00:01:41,340
How are you?

63
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,173
- [Nipsey] I'm silent, man.

64
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:43,006
Just finished my album.

65
00:01:43,006 --> 00:01:45,740
So we just tryin' to stay
creative while we get

66
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,652
the marketing ready and all that.

67
00:01:47,652 --> 00:01:49,365
I don't want to stop
being in the music vibe.

68
00:01:49,365 --> 00:01:51,779
I just wanna keep recording
up until release date.

69
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:52,847
- Stay in that zone?

70
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:53,745
- Yeah, just --

71
00:01:53,745 --> 00:01:54,659
- I love that.

72
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:55,544
- I fell out before.

73
00:01:55,544 --> 00:01:56,390
I got off music and started
getting all like videos,

74
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,025
marketing, and thinking
about selling the shit

75
00:02:00,025 --> 00:02:02,857
and it's like painful getting
back in the music mode.

76
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:04,248
So I'm like --

77
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:05,778
- [Gary] So while you're in
it, you're gonna stay in it.

78
00:02:05,778 --> 00:02:06,752
- I'm making myself at home.

79
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:07,685
- Uh huh.

80
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:09,690
Is this where you record?

81
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,718
- Well, we kinda bounce around.

82
00:02:12,718 --> 00:02:16,219
We built a spot in Burbank and we spent

83
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,732
like a year and a half,

84
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:19,404
it was like an open space.

85
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:20,357
We built the walls out,

86
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:22,901
built all the rooms acoustic from scratch

87
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:25,184
and we ended up losing the
spot 'cause we had a sublease

88
00:02:25,184 --> 00:02:27,404
and we didn't know we had a sublease.

89
00:02:27,404 --> 00:02:28,905
We thought we was renting from the owner.

90
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:29,803
- [Gary] (laughs) Fuck.

91
00:02:29,803 --> 00:02:30,812
That sucked, huh?

92
00:02:30,812 --> 00:02:31,835
- I got whooped.

93
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:32,736
I went to court.

94
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:33,636
- Damn.

95
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:34,710
- Paperwork, I never missed the rent,

96
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,790
everything was always on time.

97
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,822
Judge was like, bro, your
name ain't on the shit.

98
00:02:37,822 --> 00:02:40,071
So since then we've just
been like renting shit.

99
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:42,265
We was at Paramount for like three months.

100
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:44,014
- Is that where you did most of the album?

101
00:02:44,014 --> 00:02:45,308
- That's where we finished it.

102
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:47,213
- You started it back in that spot?

103
00:02:47,213 --> 00:02:48,576
- Yeah, exactly, exactly.

104
00:02:48,576 --> 00:02:49,596
Yep.

105
00:02:49,596 --> 00:02:51,832
- [Gary] What you started with
when I first walked in here

106
00:02:51,832 --> 00:02:54,347
about I got caught up in
the marketing and all this

107
00:02:54,347 --> 00:02:55,281
but the music stuff.

108
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:58,184
Do you just love, you
know, Boyd's just like,

109
00:02:58,184 --> 00:02:59,260
wait 'til you two meet.

110
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,191
- [Nipsey] Right, right.

111
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:01,850
- Does it just come natural to you?

112
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,878
Do you just love it?

113
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:03,776
- [Nipsey] What, the marketing?

114
00:03:03,776 --> 00:03:04,678
- Yeah.

115
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:05,580
- I mean, I'm gonna be honest, bro.

116
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,734
I never looked at it as
marketing 'til after the fact.

117
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:08,960
I looked at it as like --

118
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,060
- [Gary] Hustling and
getting it done? (laughs)

119
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,771
- Or just context for the release, right?

120
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:12,686
- [Gary] Okay.

121
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:14,264
- Like, alright, if it's,

122
00:03:14,264 --> 00:03:17,763
I look at like albums
from like Jay-Z or T.I.

123
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:19,043
or any big successful artists,

124
00:03:19,043 --> 00:03:21,467
some of they albums was really successful,

125
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,735
some of 'em was just like --

126
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:24,707
- [Gary] Not really.

127
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:26,523
- And so the difference
between the ones that were

128
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:28,095
and the ones that weren't
was the narrative,

129
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:31,926
like the I'm about to go
to jail album from T.I.

130
00:03:31,926 --> 00:03:32,848
- [Gary] Mm Hmm (affirmative).

131
00:03:32,848 --> 00:03:35,425
- Or the I just got this big movie, A-T-L,

132
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:38,268
and I'm calling my
album King and the song,

133
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:40,467
it was attached to a narrative.

134
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:43,259
With Jay-Z I watched American
Gangster and I got inspired,

135
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:46,444
I went to the studio whereas Kingdom Come,

136
00:03:46,444 --> 00:03:48,448
Oh, I'm coming out of retirement.

137
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:50,448
That was the story or...

138
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:54,156
- [Gary] Why do you think this last one

139
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:55,160
didn't pop that much?

140
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,160
- What?

141
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,162
4-4-4?

142
00:03:57,162 --> 00:03:58,164
- [Gary] Mm Hmm (affirmative).

143
00:03:58,164 --> 00:03:59,164
- I think it did pop.

144
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:00,166
- [Gary] Sales wise, they're saying,

145
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,172
like I mean culturally
you felt like it popped.

146
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:02,532
- Yeah, I think that's
the only success to me.

147
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:03,908
I don't count them other metrics.

148
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:05,746
I think that's the (inaudible) to me.

149
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:06,762
- Trading culture.

150
00:04:06,762 --> 00:04:07,763
- [Nipsey] That's it.

151
00:04:07,763 --> 00:04:08,764
If it penetrates, you did it.

152
00:04:08,764 --> 00:04:09,769
If it doesn't --

153
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:10,797
- 100%.

154
00:04:10,797 --> 00:04:11,806
That's basically all I think about.

155
00:04:11,806 --> 00:04:13,501
Attention arbitrage, hack culture.

156
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:15,904
- Yeah, if, other than that,

157
00:04:15,904 --> 00:04:17,290
everything else can be manipulated.

158
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,011
All that shit can be influenced.

159
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:20,009
- [Gary] That's right.

160
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,141
- If you go outside
and you hear the music,

161
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:23,108
you come to the concert,
everybody's singing the words --

162
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:24,196
- [Gary] Then you're good.

163
00:04:24,196 --> 00:04:25,211
- It connected.

164
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:26,226
That shit penetrated.

165
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:27,208
- [Gary] Mm Hmm (affirmative)

166
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,041
- To me

167
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:30,527
but then also, you know,

168
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:32,487
he did his shit through
title, through Sprint.

169
00:04:32,487 --> 00:04:35,780
Again, they did it as like
a unique release just to --

170
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,801
- They vig the numbers that way.

171
00:04:36,801 --> 00:04:37,799
- Yeah.

172
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:38,798
- Mm Hmm (affirmative).

173
00:04:38,798 --> 00:04:39,827
- And I'm sure he got a nice check.

174
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:40,818
I don't what --

175
00:04:40,818 --> 00:04:41,829
- Well, you know, to your point,

176
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:44,297
like there's no way he sold
all his shares to Sprint

177
00:04:44,297 --> 00:04:46,716
unless he was trading on fan and culture.

178
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:47,549
- Right.

179
00:04:47,549 --> 00:04:48,841
- So we, Sprint's a client of the company

180
00:04:48,841 --> 00:04:51,557
that Mike works for for
me, like VaynerMedia.

181
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:55,368
I know the CEO super
well, like he's trading,

182
00:04:55,368 --> 00:04:58,477
like fame is the ultimate
arbitrage in our society.

183
00:04:58,477 --> 00:04:59,475
- I agree.

184
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:00,474
- You know?

185
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:01,472
- I agree.

186
00:05:01,472 --> 00:05:02,472
- It's the ultimate arbitrage.

187
00:05:02,472 --> 00:05:03,477
- And like relevance
and like conversation --

188
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:04,487
- 100%.

189
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:05,921
- And inclusion, you know what I mean?

190
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:08,097
To be included in something
that is gonna be consumed

191
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:11,139
on that level and it's gonna
be respected on that level.

192
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:13,952
It's not gonna be like,
experienced is disposal.

193
00:05:13,952 --> 00:05:16,249
It's gonna be damn near consumed as art

194
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,977
and to be affiliated with
that, you know what I'm sayin'?

195
00:05:18,977 --> 00:05:19,977
- Mm Hmm (affirmative),

196
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:20,978
and then understanding
how to distribute it

197
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:22,343
in the modern way.

198
00:05:22,343 --> 00:05:23,345
It's always gonna change.

199
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:24,383
- I agree.

200
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:26,251
- When I think about Instagram
and things of that nature,

201
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:28,510
it's really no different than TRL, right?

202
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,823
- Right.

203
00:05:29,823 --> 00:05:31,297
- Right?

204
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:33,858
That's what Puff, I still don't,

205
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:36,044
I was watching his
documentary the other day,

206
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,615
I was hoping they'd
bring it up, they didn't.

207
00:05:37,615 --> 00:05:39,159
He hacked MTV.

208
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,447
He would just show up on set.

209
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:41,460
- And pull up?

210
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,480
- Pull up.

211
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,501
- I'm Puff --

212
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:44,492
- And like Carson, that's right,

213
00:05:44,492 --> 00:05:45,515
'cause he was smart,

214
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:46,553
he knew every single teenager's eyes

215
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:48,000
were on that at 4 P.M., right?

216
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,159
- Real sick.

217
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,968
- People didn't understand
what he was doing.

218
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:51,973
He was acting all goofy.

219
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:52,991
All he was doing --

220
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:54,677
- Yeah, that's primetime.

221
00:05:54,677 --> 00:05:55,701
He was getting a million something.

222
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:56,701
- 100%.

223
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:57,702
Back then?

224
00:05:57,702 --> 00:05:58,704
He fucking owned everybody who's,

225
00:05:58,704 --> 00:05:59,918
if you're, what am I, 41?

226
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:02,242
If you're 31 and under,
if you're 20 to 30,

227
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:03,959
like you know exactly what that was.

228
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:06,238
- Yeah, I remember TRL, Carson Daly,

229
00:06:06,238 --> 00:06:08,510
with the screaming crowd outside, yeah.

230
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,691
- And he like, that's when all
the boy bands and the girls,

231
00:06:12,691 --> 00:06:15,356
but he walked right in there
and he started hacking it.

232
00:06:15,356 --> 00:06:16,354
- [Nipsey] Yeah.

233
00:06:16,354 --> 00:06:18,081
- That's what he's
always, if you understand,

234
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:21,085
from Russell Simmons to
whoever you wanna talk about,

235
00:06:21,085 --> 00:06:23,589
everybody in hip hop who
understands how to penetrate

236
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:24,938
underpriced attention,

237
00:06:24,938 --> 00:06:26,298
wins.

238
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:27,296
- [Nipsey] Right, absolutely.

239
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:28,297
- Right?

240
00:06:28,297 --> 00:06:31,895
So for me, right now, so
if you're taking notes,

241
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:35,289
the number one thing, YouTube vlogs.

242
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,929
You get the right hook or your project.

243
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:42,095
You remember Madden when
Good Charlotte was on Madden

244
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:43,808
when you're like making
your team in the beginning?

245
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:44,941
- [Nipsey] They was playing a song.

246
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:46,451
- Right and that literally
made them famous?

247
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:48,995
That's how I think about vlogs on YouTube.

248
00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:53,518
I think getting one of these
16 tracks on the right vlog

249
00:06:53,518 --> 00:06:56,914
that gets three, four, five,
Casey, Jake and Logan Paul,

250
00:06:56,914 --> 00:06:58,596
you get the right, like in a scene,

251
00:06:58,596 --> 00:07:02,455
that in itself is so much
fuckin' underpriced attention.

252
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,676
- [Nipsey] Yeah, absolutely.

253
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:05,135
- And so that's how I think about shit.

254
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:06,778
- [Nipsey] They're like
operating on a similar,

255
00:07:06,778 --> 00:07:07,957
not to cut you off --

256
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:08,955
- No, please.

257
00:07:08,955 --> 00:07:10,262
- 50's kind of doing that with power.

258
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:13,867
He using power to like platform the music.

259
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:14,869
- 100%

260
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:16,201
- 'Cause I don't think
he was getting it off

261
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:17,207
without the TV show.

262
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:18,341
No disrespect to 50 at all but the TV show

263
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:20,474
brought a new interest to his music.

264
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:21,482
- 100%, man.

265
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,002
That's like, that's exactly right.

266
00:07:23,002 --> 00:07:25,162
I was just with The Rock like an hour ago.

267
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:27,760
That man just hacks
every fucking platform.

268
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,733
Siri commercial, Ballers on
HBO, movies, social media.

269
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:33,735
He's just --

270
00:07:33,735 --> 00:07:34,857
- [Nipsey] What's up with The Rock, man?

271
00:07:34,857 --> 00:07:35,864
What is he doing?

272
00:07:35,864 --> 00:07:37,609
- He's trying to fucking,
he's trying to win the world.

273
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:38,608
- [Nipsey] Yeah.

274
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:39,743
- The Rock is like, right?

275
00:07:39,743 --> 00:07:42,003
He's just like, you know
what's crazy about The Rock

276
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,005
is like everybody,

277
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,095
like I'm even looking at everybody's face,

278
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:48,686
this crew, Upper East Side,
58 year old white guy,

279
00:07:48,686 --> 00:07:50,082
everybody just smiles.

280
00:07:50,082 --> 00:07:51,082
- [Nipsey] Yeah.

281
00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:52,687
- And that's fucking dope.

282
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:55,494
Like that's just like,
people fuck with it,

283
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:56,493
he's hungry!

284
00:07:56,493 --> 00:07:57,597
- [Nipsey] What happened though?

285
00:07:57,597 --> 00:07:58,613
How'd he start going crazy?

286
00:07:58,613 --> 00:07:59,813
I just remember seeing The Rock --

287
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,811
- I was talking to him.

288
00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:03,287
It's kinda like, honestly,
it's the same shit I feel,

289
00:08:03,287 --> 00:08:04,925
I'm sure you feel it too,

290
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:06,554
like sometimes you just know
and it's just a fucking,

291
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:09,054
when people ask me about shit,

292
00:08:10,268 --> 00:08:11,287
all I do is ever point to my
wrist, just a matter of time.

293
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:12,322
- [Nipsey] Right, period.

294
00:08:12,322 --> 00:08:13,865
- Just a matter of time.

295
00:08:13,865 --> 00:08:15,164
- [Nipsey] Yeah, that's right.

296
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:16,216
- I'm with you for four seconds.

297
00:08:16,216 --> 00:08:17,213
I can see it in your face.

298
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:18,238
Once, you just know.

299
00:08:18,238 --> 00:08:19,267
- [Nipsey] Yeah, no question.

300
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:20,267
- You just know.

301
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,267
- [Nipsey] No shit, I feel like that.

302
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,271
- Right?

303
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,266
- [Nipsey] That's real.

304
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:24,271
- That's right.

305
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,289
You know it's in there somewhere.

306
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:26,269
Like to me, I really popped on Twitter.

307
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:27,286
I was one of the first people in the world

308
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:28,346
to have a million followers on Twitter.

309
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:29,347
- [Nipsey] Right.

310
00:08:29,347 --> 00:08:30,180
- Then I got busy, did my thing and like,

311
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,013
when Instagram and all that,

312
00:08:31,013 --> 00:08:32,182
then I was quiet for a little bit,

313
00:08:32,182 --> 00:08:34,898
YouTube, you know, and then it was like,

314
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:36,931
just a matter of time
and then I got hot again.

315
00:08:36,931 --> 00:08:39,256
Like if you're good enough,
shit's gonna work out

316
00:08:39,256 --> 00:08:42,816
and that's what The Rock,
like if you asked me,

317
00:08:42,816 --> 00:08:44,474
if was the first time
we really chopped it up,

318
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:46,569
it was just like when he was like,

319
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,683
tried to play football,
when he went to wrestling,

320
00:08:48,683 --> 00:08:51,737
even when he was at wrestling,
when we was The fucking Rock,

321
00:08:51,737 --> 00:08:53,633
he still knew there was more.

322
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,637
- [Nipsey] Right, no question.

323
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:57,008
- Do you think that that
opportunity is something

324
00:08:57,008 --> 00:08:59,445
that everybody has access
to or if it's innate?

325
00:08:59,445 --> 00:09:02,751
- I think that every, today's world,

326
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,182
there's no more old white
guy being the gatekeeper,

327
00:09:05,182 --> 00:09:06,769
so everybody's got an at bat.

328
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:07,796
- [Nipsey] I agree.

329
00:09:07,796 --> 00:09:09,367
- I just don't think
everybody's got it like that

330
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:13,852
but I think everybody
can maximize their shit.

331
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:15,698
So not everybody's destined,

332
00:09:15,698 --> 00:09:18,180
listen, I love playing basketball,
I'm not fuckin' LeBron.

333
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,403
- [Sophie] Right, right.

334
00:09:19,403 --> 00:09:20,475
- You know what I mean?

335
00:09:20,475 --> 00:09:22,181
So we've all got our talents but you know,

336
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:24,591
what you guys do for a living,

337
00:09:24,591 --> 00:09:26,712
I mean, I'm looking at music

338
00:09:26,712 --> 00:09:27,943
and I'm spending a lot
of time looking at it,

339
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:31,866
fucking Sound Cloud, Spotify,
putting music on vlogs,

340
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:34,431
like no more Jimmy Iovine trips over you.

341
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:37,611
No more fucking, like you got,

342
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:40,844
you're fucking one song
away on putting out shit

343
00:09:40,844 --> 00:09:43,946
and you don't even need RapCaviar.

344
00:09:43,946 --> 00:09:48,922
You just need to put out music
and I think the one variable,

345
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,909
the shit that I fuckin'
trade on is trade culture.

346
00:09:51,909 --> 00:09:55,346
If you're hungry and like trying
to think about your career,

347
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:57,988
it's so hungry right now where you're at,

348
00:09:57,988 --> 00:09:59,137
young and like, right?

349
00:09:59,137 --> 00:10:00,138
- [Nipsey] Yeah.

350
00:10:00,138 --> 00:10:01,448
- And what's going through
your mind is the same shit

351
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:02,446
that went through my mind 30 times.

352
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:03,886
You saying to yourself, in your mind,

353
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:06,001
this project especially
with this man, this project?

354
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:08,339
Oh, this is what it's gonna be.

355
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,652
This is when it's gonna
happen and guess what?

356
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,721
It might not.

357
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:14,617
I just did Apple's first show, right?

358
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:17,332
Will.I.Am, Jessica Alba,
Gwyneth Paltrow and me,

359
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:18,871
Shark Tank for apps, right?

360
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:21,038
And me and my team, DRock'll tell you,

361
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,175
I'm like this is gonna be it.

362
00:10:22,175 --> 00:10:23,314
They're gonna spend 20 million,

363
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:25,197
I'm gonna be on every billboard,
it's gonna fuckin' pop.

364
00:10:25,197 --> 00:10:26,577
It's gonna be the next Netflix,

365
00:10:26,577 --> 00:10:28,128
they won't call it Apple music,

366
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,620
they'll change it up before it comes out.

367
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,868
They'll buy Netflix, it'll be big.

368
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:32,360
Did it?

369
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,678
Nope, they put out Apple music,

370
00:10:33,678 --> 00:10:36,663
nobody here's fuckin' watching
TV shows on Apple music yet.

371
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:39,905
It's not how we think so fucking 30 years

372
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,643
I've been working my fuckin' face off,

373
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:43,911
I'm like this is gonna be
the moment and it wasn't.

374
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:44,908
- [Nipsey] Right.

375
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:46,612
- But when you know you've got it,

376
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,199
you just go to the next thing.

377
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:50,767
So I think, like for me, if I'm in music,

378
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:53,189
I wish I could rap because
I know I could be humongous

379
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:55,720
because all I would do is make music

380
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,236
and then lay in bed for 11 hours,

381
00:10:58,236 --> 00:10:59,358
try to hack on social media.

382
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,704
Gettin' my shit recognized, noticed.

383
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:04,326
You're one person away,
one piece of content away.

384
00:11:04,326 --> 00:11:06,211
You just gotta fuckin' make it

385
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:08,307
and what's amazing
about music and I can't,

386
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:09,309
I think everybody,

387
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:11,240
I don't like speaking
about shit I don't know

388
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,469
so I don't wanna speak to
it but one thing I do know

389
00:11:13,469 --> 00:11:15,577
is I believe that every
artist that ever lived

390
00:11:15,577 --> 00:11:17,975
had a lot more songs in their fuckin' dome

391
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:19,469
than ever saw the day of life

392
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:21,442
because of the way it worked, right?

393
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:23,568
Now everybody's fancy.

394
00:11:23,568 --> 00:11:26,097
Everybody's trying to
understand supply and demand?

395
00:11:26,097 --> 00:11:28,550
I don't think people understand
how busy the world is.

396
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,566
The world's so busy, there's so much shit,

397
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:33,576
that I'm a big fan of telling
people to put out music.

398
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:35,107
Put out music, like fucking every week,

399
00:11:35,107 --> 00:11:36,550
like if you've got it like that?

400
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,116
I mean, some people don't
have it, I don't know,

401
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:41,361
but if you've got it like
that, put it out, put it out.

402
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:43,772
People are hungry for it
and every time you put out,

403
00:11:43,772 --> 00:11:45,316
that's giving you another at bat.

404
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:49,023
- [Nipsey] And it creates
momentum too, just by,

405
00:11:49,023 --> 00:11:53,190
it's like a fashion brand,
they deliver in every season.

406
00:11:55,376 --> 00:11:56,598
- [Gary] 100%.

407
00:11:56,598 --> 00:11:58,415
- Almost like a release schedule --

408
00:11:58,415 --> 00:12:01,091
- But they gotta make the
shit, they gotta distribute it,

409
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:03,365
they gotta make that hat,
they gotta make those kicks.

410
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:04,379
It's slow.

411
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:07,467
Like fuck, from studio
to fuckin' the world,

412
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:08,926
it's just so crazy.

413
00:12:08,926 --> 00:12:12,345
I think there will be a big
time artist in the next decade

414
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:13,732
that puts out a song a day.

415
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,183
- I agree with that.

416
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:18,668
We did a campaign last year
called Marathon Mondays,

417
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:19,995
we dropped a song every Monday.

418
00:12:19,995 --> 00:12:21,122
- [Gary] Mm Hmm (affirmative).

419
00:12:21,122 --> 00:12:22,632
- And I saw the reaction to that more so

420
00:12:22,632 --> 00:12:23,988
than dropping an album.

421
00:12:23,988 --> 00:12:24,989
- 100.

422
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:26,239
I'm telling you right now,

423
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,124
somebody's gonna wake up
and do something called 365,

424
00:12:28,124 --> 00:12:29,123
- [Nipsey] Yeah.

425
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,082
- And they're gonna start
on fuckin' January 1st

426
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:32,529
and they're gonna fucking go.

427
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:34,408
- [Nipsey] Who did a version of that,

428
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:36,009
didn't Crooked Eye do a verse a day?

429
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:37,256
I don't think he did a song.

430
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,976
- [Sophie] Emilio Rojas did
like 30 songs for 30 days

431
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:42,284
type shit but it wasn't,

432
00:12:42,284 --> 00:12:44,763
you really gotta be like
somebody, somebody --

433
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,191
- [Gary] I mean, you gotta
really have fuckin' talent,

434
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:48,192
- [Nipsey] Yeah.

435
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:50,934
- To drop 365 songs, discipline, hunger,

436
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:52,447
you gotta have a team.

437
00:12:52,447 --> 00:12:53,501
Boyd!

438
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:54,498
- [Boyd] What's up?

439
00:12:54,498 --> 00:12:55,526
- [Gary] What up, my man?

440
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:56,740
- [Nipsey] What's up, O.G.?

441
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,815
How you feelin'?

442
00:12:57,815 --> 00:12:58,814
- How you doin', man?

443
00:12:58,814 --> 00:12:59,823
It's good to see you.

444
00:12:59,823 --> 00:13:00,821
- Yes, sir, likewise, likewise.

445
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:01,822
(slapping hands and backs)

446
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,026
- But if you, somebody,
if you feel like (exhales)

447
00:13:03,026 --> 00:13:05,511
that'd be the first piece
of advice from fucking HOV

448
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:09,554
to fuckin' some kid right
now who's never done --

449
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:10,634
- [Nipsey] (inaudible) every morning?

450
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:11,892
- [Male] We could do that.

451
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:12,897
- [Nipsey] Instead of --

452
00:13:12,897 --> 00:13:13,897
- You think you could?

453
00:13:13,897 --> 00:13:15,079
I mean, like I'm telling you right now.

454
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:16,866
I'm telling you right
now, you would, you could,

455
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:18,369
especially if you're talented.

456
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:20,041
Somebody shitty puts out (laughs),

457
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,146
you put out 364 whacked shit,

458
00:13:22,146 --> 00:13:24,813
you put out 39 fuckin's bangers,

459
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:29,010
another 100 like fuckin' solid shit,

460
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,716
like you're gonna have a
throw away here and there.

461
00:13:30,716 --> 00:13:34,192
The reason I love 365 is
you can social commentate.

462
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:36,967
Like what people love is relevance.

463
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:38,384
I don't know how,

464
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,754
do you write or do you
just go from the dome?

465
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:41,800
- I do both --

466
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,349
- Right, so for me, like
just culture, right?

467
00:13:45,349 --> 00:13:48,483
Game seven in the NBA
finals, you slip a little,

468
00:13:48,483 --> 00:13:50,846
nobody can beat you to the market.

469
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:52,904
You're just droppin' shit that
everybody gives a fuck about.

470
00:13:52,904 --> 00:13:54,979
Something pops on fuckin' Instagram

471
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:57,202
and everyone's talkin' about
it, just one little line.

472
00:13:57,202 --> 00:14:00,019
That's what hooks people,
that's what hooks it, you know?

473
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:01,030
- [Nipsey] It's current.

474
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,028
- Real current.

475
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:03,027
- [Nipsey] Yeah.

476
00:14:03,027 --> 00:14:04,043
- It's just, to have that discipline

477
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,043
and to put yourself out there,

478
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:08,391
to put yourself out there like yo,

479
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:09,830
I'm gonna actually do this, that's hard.

480
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,568
- [Sophie] Yeah, it's a risk.

481
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:13,454
- It's a risk but the reward,

482
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:14,944
I'm all about risk-reward, right?

483
00:14:14,944 --> 00:14:16,762
I did a sneaker like all upside,

484
00:14:16,762 --> 00:14:19,796
the sneaker I got coming out,

485
00:14:19,796 --> 00:14:22,165
if it fails like nobody expects

486
00:14:22,165 --> 00:14:24,521
a 40 year old fuckin' entrepreneur

487
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:25,627
to have a hot kick, right?

488
00:14:25,627 --> 00:14:29,948
But if it works (laughs), right?

489
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:32,578
I fuckin' had 2,000 people
at Shoe Palace on Melrose

490
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:35,657
Tuesday night and the owner
walked in and he's like,

491
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:37,362
"There's more people here than
when we dropped the Yeezys."

492
00:14:37,362 --> 00:14:38,367
Everybody heard that.

493
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:39,445
- [Nipsey] That's right.

494
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,603
- And that's it.

495
00:14:41,603 --> 00:14:43,040
That's what I keep doin', right?

496
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,003
And the best part is you
just have to have humility.

497
00:14:45,003 --> 00:14:46,776
If there were six people
there, I'd be like, I lost

498
00:14:46,776 --> 00:14:50,471
and that's just when you get to that place

499
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:51,871
where you just don't give a fuck

500
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:52,870
about what anybody else thinks.

501
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,264
That's how you put out 365 music, right?

502
00:14:54,264 --> 00:14:59,118
'Cause that Sunday, February
9th, you put out something okay

503
00:14:59,118 --> 00:15:00,418
and people are like quack, quack

504
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:01,525
you shouldn't have done this project.

505
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,577
That's when you get punched
in the fuckin' mouth

506
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:05,625
and are you gonna fuckin' drink that blood

507
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,076
and just record the next
day and fuckin' get 'em

508
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:10,197
or are you gonna fold like a cheap chair

509
00:15:10,197 --> 00:15:12,487
and be like fuck me?

510
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:13,499
So you have to have the right DNA

511
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:14,881
to go for those kind of projects.

512
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:17,092
- [Nipsey] And that's what
they end up respectin'.

513
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:18,224
- 100%.

514
00:15:18,224 --> 00:15:20,447
- You know what I mean,
is that you executed it.

515
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:21,458
- And then all the upside,

516
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:25,114
like if on day 311 (laughs), right?

517
00:15:25,114 --> 00:15:28,547
Like Thanksgiving dinner is the hit,

518
00:15:28,547 --> 00:15:30,214
- [Sophie] That'd be great.

519
00:15:30,214 --> 00:15:32,285
- [Nipsey] And what's crazy
is it's a streamin' game.

520
00:15:32,285 --> 00:15:36,653
So back in the day that probably
would be against they model

521
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:37,705
but it's streaming to --

522
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:39,053
- Of course it was against the model.

523
00:15:39,053 --> 00:15:41,184
You had to make 12, you
gotta print the fuckin' CDs.

524
00:15:41,184 --> 00:15:43,236
You gotta get it to fuckin'
Wal Mart, Sam Goody.

525
00:15:43,236 --> 00:15:44,570
It wasn't real.

526
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,737
Now, you know, it's just so different.

527
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,203
Nobody's got control.

528
00:15:50,203 --> 00:15:54,355
It's you and the fuckin' kids
that got it in their ear.

529
00:15:54,355 --> 00:15:55,571
- [Nipsey] I think the biggest thing,

530
00:15:55,571 --> 00:15:57,350
the biggest restriction
is everybody thinking

531
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,400
in the old mentality.

532
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,725
- 100% 'cause there's a lot
of money in the old mentality.

533
00:16:00,725 --> 00:16:01,724
People are sad.

534
00:16:01,724 --> 00:16:03,495
- [Nipsey] People got
rich in the old mentality.

535
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,672
- Are you kidding?

536
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,219
Will, Will, I was with Will
and he's just like, he said,

537
00:16:07,219 --> 00:16:10,855
music, he was basically
complaining about streaming.

538
00:16:10,855 --> 00:16:15,022
I was like, yo, I'm like,
it's just 1984 anymore, man.

539
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,875
Sorry that you can't put out Thriller

540
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:23,641
and buy a fuckin' amusement park (laughs).

541
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:24,644
- [Nipsey] I don't understand

542
00:16:24,644 --> 00:16:25,650
why people complain about streaming.

543
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,514
I made more off streaming
than I do off sales.

544
00:16:27,514 --> 00:16:28,783
I'm sure everybody do.

545
00:16:28,783 --> 00:16:31,667
- I think the tip, truth is I don't know,

546
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:34,541
I'm sure the tippy top of
the sphere might have gotten,

547
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,296
I don't know, I don't know.

548
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:37,707
- [Nipsey] I think that the label,

549
00:16:37,707 --> 00:16:39,379
I think that what they complainin' about

550
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:42,363
it is the label contract --

551
00:16:42,363 --> 00:16:43,611
- That's got them locked up.

552
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:44,651
100%.

553
00:16:44,651 --> 00:16:45,670
- Yeah, they don't have an agreement

554
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,669
because this is a new platform.

555
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:47,676
- How did your whole thing go down?

556
00:16:47,676 --> 00:16:50,245
When did you first like
hit the scene and how,

557
00:16:50,245 --> 00:16:53,242
I mean you were talking about
him in 2000 fuckin' nine.

558
00:16:53,242 --> 00:16:54,242
- [Nipsey] That's about when.

559
00:16:54,242 --> 00:16:55,244
- [Boyd] Yeah.

560
00:16:55,244 --> 00:16:56,243
- Yeah, right?

561
00:16:56,243 --> 00:16:58,236
I remember it was '09 'cause
we just started Vayner

562
00:16:58,236 --> 00:16:59,309
and I just remember your name.

563
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,302
I love, hustle's my
favorite word on earth,

564
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:03,451
so I was like whoever that
is, I like him (laughs).

565
00:17:03,451 --> 00:17:04,773
- You know what's crazy?

566
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,434
Charlie Walk told me that
when we signed our contract,

567
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:09,628
"Brah, I don't even
need to hear your music.

568
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:10,786
"I'm signing you off your name."

569
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:12,819
All the A&R has heard
the music but he like,

570
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,000
"Fuck that, we gonna do the deal.

571
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:15,744
"We don't need to hear nothing."

572
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,369
We got The Weeknd, Republic
is like killing shit.

573
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,792
- [Gary] He's got that
Hailey Seinfeld or whatever,

574
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:21,875
she was an actress and he signed her.

575
00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:25,338
- [Nipsey] Yeah, it's like two
or three other heavyweights,

576
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:26,361
I forgot the names but --

577
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:27,349
- [Boyd] Yeah, Ariana Grande.

578
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,362
- [Nipsey] Right.

579
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:29,364
- [Gary] Grande, yeah.

580
00:17:29,364 --> 00:17:31,562
- [Nipsey] There's a lot of
shit over there going viral.

581
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:32,918
- But basically why I'm so
excited you guys are meeting is,

582
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:36,511
I don't think there's anyone in hip hop

583
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,143
who could really change
things like Nipsey can

584
00:17:38,143 --> 00:17:40,180
and the other thing about it is,

585
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,827
I've seen you speak a couple times

586
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:45,920
and then I've spoken to a
few people in the tech world

587
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,793
that like set up these
speaking engagements

588
00:17:47,793 --> 00:17:52,630
or these conferences or
Gary speaks all the time.

589
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:57,100
When I saw him speak, it was
like I've heard a lot of people

590
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,581
say the same type of stuff.

591
00:17:58,581 --> 00:18:01,998
I've never understood it
until I heard him say it

592
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:05,674
and so it's like because of
your firsthand experience

593
00:18:05,674 --> 00:18:07,294
and then because of your view,

594
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,040
like your point of view and just the way

595
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,201
you are able to communicate to people

596
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:12,058
and just have people understand things,

597
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,201
and then like the stuff
you're doing with the clothing

598
00:18:14,201 --> 00:18:15,294
and then when you,

599
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,641
I watched the video when
you went into Starbucks

600
00:18:16,641 --> 00:18:20,865
and you met I and now
he's like your CTO --

601
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:22,188
- [Nipsey] Right, right.

602
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:24,141
- Like how many rappers have a CTO, right?

603
00:18:24,141 --> 00:18:27,982
But when he walked in
Starbucks, yeah Igris was,

604
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,112
the guy right over here --

605
00:18:29,112 --> 00:18:30,824
- What were you just having a
coffee and just sittin' there?

606
00:18:30,824 --> 00:18:32,704
- No, he was doing his
work on the computer

607
00:18:32,704 --> 00:18:33,981
but he was doing like this
ADR stuff to like help

608
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:37,481
like when the cars are driving themselves,

609
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:40,869
like he's a genius,
like literally a genius.

610
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,963
- What he's explaining,

611
00:18:42,963 --> 00:18:44,537
he had some technology
on a Starbucks table

612
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:45,967
and I had my daughter,

613
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:47,084
I was just taking her to the bathroom,

614
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,362
and it was like some shit
I hadn't seen before.

615
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:52,259
It was like reading the
bone structure of his hand

616
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:55,786
off of a LCD piece of hardware --

617
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:57,600
- [Gary] So you just caught
this in the corner of your eye?

618
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,871
- Well I just walked past him and seen it

619
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,414
and I know enough about
tech to know that that's

620
00:19:01,414 --> 00:19:03,844
not no shit that's out so I just was like,

621
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:04,863
bro, what is that?

622
00:19:04,863 --> 00:19:05,858
And then, you know --

623
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:06,863
- [Gary] Got to talking.

624
00:19:06,863 --> 00:19:07,944
- Yeah, we start talking,
he's a young dude,

625
00:19:07,944 --> 00:19:12,072
and he started explaining
that it was autonomous driving

626
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:15,925
that he was designing for
Uber and he started telling me

627
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:20,092
his story how he was like
President Obama's STEM specialist

628
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:26,153
for the youth and how he was
offered a scholarship to MIT

629
00:19:26,153 --> 00:19:28,686
and turned it down and
has all these projects

630
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:29,689
he's working on.

631
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:30,690
He's 18 --

632
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,702
- (laughs) I love that.

633
00:19:31,702 --> 00:19:34,640
- And I'm like yeah,
we gotta sit down, bro.

634
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,329
So we sat down and --

635
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:39,117
- What was the Star, right here,

636
00:19:39,117 --> 00:19:40,589
this Starbucks I just
stopped by or somewhere else?

637
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:41,588
- We was in LA.

638
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:46,216
It was on Figueroa and,
go ahead, Ig-ris, I mean,

639
00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:48,286
basically by us sitting
down after that meeting,

640
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:52,514
he basically opened my
mind up to how we can,

641
00:19:52,514 --> 00:19:56,500
where we intersect as far as
tech and as far as hip hop

642
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,787
and culture and just --

643
00:19:57,787 --> 00:20:00,032
- Tech is the oxygen of our society.

644
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,131
- [Nipsey] Right.

645
00:20:01,131 --> 00:20:02,309
- I don't think people understand.

646
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:04,266
I'm sure you're gonna understand this,

647
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:06,740
everybody in this room, looking around,

648
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,748
everyone's quite young.

649
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,299
We're all gonna live in
a mixed reality world,

650
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:11,941
contact lens where we're
sitting here right now,

651
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:15,680
fuckin' Pac and VR is
sitting right here with us,

652
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,624
like people don't, people think this is,

653
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:19,163
people have no clue.

654
00:20:19,163 --> 00:20:20,410
They think shit's crazy now?

655
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,791
We haven't even started.

656
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,661
This is the fuckin' national
anthem of a 19 inning game,

657
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:27,021
like people haven't even
rapped their head around

658
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:28,673
how fucked up shit is gonna be.

659
00:20:28,673 --> 00:20:29,722
- [Nipsey] Right.

660
00:20:29,722 --> 00:20:30,757
I agree.

661
00:20:30,757 --> 00:20:32,519
- [Gary] So your hardcore
AR, machine learning,

662
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:34,047
is that like?

663
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:37,523
Are you fucking around
with Blockchain yet?

664
00:20:37,523 --> 00:20:38,528
- Yeah.

665
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,520
- [Gary] You enjoying that?

666
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,525
- Yeah.

667
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:41,771
- [Gary] You hacking
on top of Ethereum yet?

668
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:42,772
- Oh, no, not yet.

669
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:43,777
- [Gary] Not yet.

670
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:44,778
- But --

671
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:45,780
- [Gary] But it's caught your eye, right?

672
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,777
- Yeah, it caught my eye.

673
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:47,780
- [Gary] Yeah, that
shit's gonna be fuckin'.

674
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,780
- [Nipsey] Do you have
your laptop with you?

675
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,934
Could you pull it in here
when you get a second.

676
00:20:50,934 --> 00:20:52,908
- Yah, and then they got
some other crazy shit

677
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:55,030
where it's like everyone
is selling stuff online

678
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,272
and they set it up where
like, so he has a store,

679
00:20:58,272 --> 00:21:00,284
like a successful store, physical store --

680
00:21:00,284 --> 00:21:01,725
- [Gary] Bricks and --

681
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:02,884
- He has a real successful store

682
00:21:02,884 --> 00:21:05,801
and like when you pull the phone up

683
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:09,632
and you point it at the shirt,

684
00:21:09,632 --> 00:21:10,632
it starts playing it
like an unreleased song.

685
00:21:10,632 --> 00:21:11,465
- A-R.

686
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:13,373
- So there's a reason you
have to be in the store

687
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,583
where everyone else is like
yeah, come to my store.

688
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,999
It's a meet and greet.

689
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:17,156
I might show up.

690
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:18,386
It's like you actually
have to go to his store

691
00:21:18,386 --> 00:21:19,398
to get something.

692
00:21:19,398 --> 00:21:20,397
- [Nipsey] Right.

693
00:21:20,397 --> 00:21:21,411
- It's like they're --

694
00:21:21,411 --> 00:21:22,415
- Where is that store?

695
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:23,414
- [Nipsey] It's on Crenshaw and Slauson.

696
00:21:23,414 --> 00:21:24,421
- We need to go there.

697
00:21:24,421 --> 00:21:25,423
I wanna see it.

698
00:21:25,423 --> 00:21:26,422
- Yeah, for sure.

699
00:21:26,422 --> 00:21:27,422
That's the corner,

700
00:21:27,422 --> 00:21:28,426
like that's right the main intersection

701
00:21:28,426 --> 00:21:29,436
in my neighborhood where I grew up at.

702
00:21:29,436 --> 00:21:30,476
- [Gary] What was there when you were a,

703
00:21:30,476 --> 00:21:31,798
what was at that spot when you were a kid?

704
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:32,796
- It was a vacant lot.

705
00:21:32,796 --> 00:21:33,803
- [Gary] The whole time
when you were a kid?

706
00:21:33,803 --> 00:21:38,076
- Yeah, we used to sell
dope and we coined it

707
00:21:38,076 --> 00:21:40,115
as the world's first SMART
store but it's basically,

708
00:21:40,115 --> 00:21:41,288
like he was explaining,

709
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:43,505
you know there's like walls
that are content walls

710
00:21:43,505 --> 00:21:45,597
and it has a big logo,
the Marathon logo --

711
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:46,613
- [Gary] And when you go --

712
00:21:46,613 --> 00:21:47,657
- Yeah and there's a --

713
00:21:47,657 --> 00:21:48,975
- So what, your app triggers it?

714
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,584
- Yeah, so the app is,
I just encoded the app,

715
00:21:51,584 --> 00:21:53,556
and so basically what you will do,

716
00:21:53,556 --> 00:21:55,220
and even on the actual,

717
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,868
like say this was a Marathon sweater,

718
00:21:56,868 --> 00:21:58,066
there will be a logo --

719
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,492
- Yeah, of course, oh I know
this whole world real well.

720
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:01,643
- So this the Marathon clothing app.

721
00:22:01,643 --> 00:22:04,752
So then you'll click experience --

722
00:22:04,752 --> 00:22:06,623
- And then once you point
it, it fucking activates.

723
00:22:06,623 --> 00:22:07,600
- Exactly.

724
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,737
- Yep.

725
00:22:08,737 --> 00:22:10,870
And what's really crazy is
you know the next iPhone

726
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,134
has the AR kit built into it naturally.

727
00:22:13,134 --> 00:22:14,133
- Right.

728
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,744
- So you don't even have
to download the app.

729
00:22:15,744 --> 00:22:16,744
- [Male] Oh, so it's --

730
00:22:16,744 --> 00:22:17,755
- It's part of the operating system.

731
00:22:17,755 --> 00:22:18,753
- What does AR stand for?

732
00:22:18,753 --> 00:22:19,766
What do y'all mean?

733
00:22:19,766 --> 00:22:20,767
- Augmented reality.

734
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:21,767
- Oh, right.

735
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:22,817
- So like you know on
SnapChat when you look at it

736
00:22:22,817 --> 00:22:23,804
and all the cartoons pop up?

737
00:22:23,804 --> 00:22:25,001
The way it's all gonna play out

738
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:26,416
and you know what virtual
reality is, right?

739
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:27,414
- [Nipsey] Right.

740
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:28,489
- The way it's probably gonna play out,

741
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:31,330
I mean I'm not fuckin' a
futurist but it looks like it,

742
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,351
is all of us 15 years
from now, contact lens,

743
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:37,162
brain talks to it and
we switch from real life

744
00:22:37,162 --> 00:22:40,829
to completely being in
a virtual world or AR

745
00:22:41,837 --> 00:22:44,445
where all the stuff you see
on SnapChat and Instagram,

746
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:46,052
there's just fuckin' shit in here.

747
00:22:46,052 --> 00:22:47,091
Like here's the butterfly.

748
00:22:47,091 --> 00:22:48,343
- [Nipsey] Right, right.

749
00:22:48,343 --> 00:22:49,342
- Like that's our life.

750
00:22:49,342 --> 00:22:50,356
- [Nipsey] Right.

751
00:22:50,356 --> 00:22:53,127
- You know what's really crazy about it,

752
00:22:53,127 --> 00:22:55,712
is it's just straight up true.

753
00:22:55,712 --> 00:22:58,324
Like it's not even guessing.

754
00:22:58,324 --> 00:22:59,530
- [Nipsey] Yeah, no, it's not --

755
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,052
- It's not even like,
yeah, it's not Star Trek.

756
00:23:01,052 --> 00:23:02,298
It's like everybody here in 20 years, bet.

757
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:03,499
Banked.

758
00:23:03,499 --> 00:23:05,466
Locked and loaded.

759
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:06,823
- [Nipsey] So what does that mean?

760
00:23:06,823 --> 00:23:08,971
What type of businesses are
going to be built around that?

761
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,278
- Well, what kind of businesses

762
00:23:10,278 --> 00:23:11,474
are gonna get disrupted, right?

763
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:12,995
Like if you actually think
you're at the Eiffel Tower

764
00:23:12,995 --> 00:23:14,839
by just closing your eyes,

765
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:15,840
- [Nipsey] Why go?

766
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,841
- Why go?

767
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:17,844
- [Nipsey] Right?

768
00:23:17,844 --> 00:23:18,842
- Right?

769
00:23:18,842 --> 00:23:20,069
So then you start thinking
about shit like San Diego,

770
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:22,241
like where are the places
where there's just nice weather

771
00:23:22,241 --> 00:23:23,399
and it's just chill?

772
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:25,386
If everything's just kind
of happening like that,

773
00:23:25,386 --> 00:23:28,013
how expensive is New York City rent?

774
00:23:28,013 --> 00:23:31,414
Like that's where you start
debating shit like that, right?

775
00:23:31,414 --> 00:23:34,032
I think it's all about IP.

776
00:23:34,032 --> 00:23:37,145
I think everything is,
all the pipes are dumb,

777
00:23:37,145 --> 00:23:38,514
what you fill it with is everything.

778
00:23:38,514 --> 00:23:39,544
- [Nipsey] Right, so content.

779
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:40,658
- Content.

780
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:41,844
- Just what you say, I'm thinking,

781
00:23:41,844 --> 00:23:43,940
and even in my field of hip hop,

782
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,105
I think when we look at Mickey or Disney

783
00:23:48,105 --> 00:23:49,370
or we look at like Hello Kitty --

784
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,885
- [Gary] Oh, there's so much.

785
00:23:50,885 --> 00:23:53,718
- It's like it started as content.

786
00:23:54,597 --> 00:23:55,697
- [Gary] 'Member BAPE the Bathing Ape?

787
00:23:55,697 --> 00:23:59,120
When BAPE was blowing up in like '08, '09,

788
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,229
Mike, my brother and I, we had websites.

789
00:24:02,229 --> 00:24:03,860
We had something called
BAPE the Bathing Ape.

790
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,943
We were just trying to like,

791
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,382
just like hacking 'cause cartoons scale.

792
00:24:07,382 --> 00:24:11,219
Like Vince McMahon makes
money on Hulk Hogan

793
00:24:11,219 --> 00:24:12,836
and Andre the Giant.

794
00:24:12,836 --> 00:24:15,136
Andre's been dead for fuckin' 20 years.

795
00:24:15,136 --> 00:24:16,112
Vince McMahon makes money.

796
00:24:16,112 --> 00:24:17,113
- Right.

797
00:24:17,113 --> 00:24:19,243
Hip hop is the same.

798
00:24:19,243 --> 00:24:20,570
- 100%.

799
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,794
- I don't think that Snoop
Dogg is any different

800
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,091
than Mickey Mouse.

801
00:24:24,091 --> 00:24:25,769
- [Gary] I totally agree.

802
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:27,090
- And he was content,

803
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,345
the same way that Mickey
Mouse was a cartoon

804
00:24:29,345 --> 00:24:30,543
and it turned into a world,

805
00:24:30,543 --> 00:24:33,240
it turned into tangible products
and it turned into things

806
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,488
that can be downloaded and can be sold.

807
00:24:35,488 --> 00:24:37,539
I think rap is in that point of view.

808
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:38,987
I think that's why the Yeezys,

809
00:24:38,987 --> 00:24:40,577
I think Ye is doing that with Yeezys.

810
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:41,577
- 100%.

811
00:24:41,577 --> 00:24:44,749
- And I feel like, to me,
I wanna be a part of that.

812
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:47,483
I wanna be one of the ones
that take a cash register

813
00:24:47,483 --> 00:24:50,195
for the music and shift
it and use the music

814
00:24:50,195 --> 00:24:51,316
to bring attention to it.

815
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:52,361
- [Gary] The music is the leverage.

816
00:24:52,361 --> 00:24:53,361
- [Nipsey] Right.

817
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:56,416
- And right now people have to make money,

818
00:24:56,416 --> 00:25:00,411
the basic players have to go
on tour and make money that way

819
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:03,511
because they're not deploying
what you guys are doing

820
00:25:03,511 --> 00:25:06,258
and like you've got a
scale and people are,

821
00:25:06,258 --> 00:25:07,421
they're renting, right?

822
00:25:07,421 --> 00:25:08,771
They're putting their name on something

823
00:25:08,771 --> 00:25:10,900
but the company's making all the dollars

824
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,114
but Puma is actually not that
hard to replicate, right?

825
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:18,281
Even the next, even the next
Yeezys is not gonna be done

826
00:25:19,524 --> 00:25:21,495
in conjunction with Adidas.

827
00:25:21,495 --> 00:25:22,472
- Thank you, homey.

828
00:25:22,472 --> 00:25:23,477
Please.

829
00:25:23,477 --> 00:25:26,242
- Because the infrastructure
costs are just not that high.

830
00:25:26,242 --> 00:25:27,247
- Right.

831
00:25:27,247 --> 00:25:29,216
- Like when you start
realizing it's a hell,

832
00:25:29,216 --> 00:25:31,049
the Kanye part's a hell of a lot harder

833
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:32,554
than making this shit.

834
00:25:32,554 --> 00:25:34,658
- That's why I like Big Baller brand.

835
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,119
I don't care what nobody
say about the ugly ass shoe.

836
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,875
I fuck with the model.

837
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:42,292
- I was on ESPN Sportsnation two days ago

838
00:25:44,495 --> 00:25:45,699
and they brought it, we're like, I want,

839
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:49,108
my big thing for last 20, 10 years,

840
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:50,106
I've been putting on the internet,

841
00:25:50,106 --> 00:25:51,105
I'm buying the New York Jets.

842
00:25:51,105 --> 00:25:52,121
That's my thing.

843
00:25:52,121 --> 00:25:53,119
- [Nipsey] Talk to me.

844
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,126
- So they started with that.

845
00:25:54,126 --> 00:25:55,125
They asked me about Big Baller
and I'm like, he's smart.

846
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:56,319
I'm like look, some of the
stuff he pushes a little far

847
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,574
but like don't get it confused.

848
00:25:57,574 --> 00:25:59,905
The essence of what he's
doing is exactly right.

849
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:01,497
- [Nipsey] Yeah, just the
model, not a design --

850
00:26:01,497 --> 00:26:02,784
- You know what's,

851
00:26:02,784 --> 00:26:04,626
actually let me take you
somewhere that you're gonna like

852
00:26:04,626 --> 00:26:06,550
based now that I know
where your mind's at.

853
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,567
- [Nipsey] Right.

854
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:08,651
- I'm gonna throw something at the,

855
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:09,799
I wanna get everybody's reaction.

856
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:13,043
I think the NBA is the craziest shit.

857
00:26:13,043 --> 00:26:15,184
I actually think the way
the NBA is structured,

858
00:26:15,184 --> 00:26:19,728
that if tomorrow we woke up
and heard that Steph Curry,

859
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:21,561
LeBron, Durant, right?

860
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,065
- [Nipsey] They left to start they own?

861
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:27,880
- 11, 12, let's call it
14 of 'em, Russ, right?

862
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,225
If 14 of 'em were like
we're out (hands clapping)

863
00:26:30,225 --> 00:26:33,073
and now we each are the first
14 teams and our billionaire,

864
00:26:33,073 --> 00:26:34,944
there's a lot of billionaires out there --

865
00:26:34,944 --> 00:26:37,479
- [Nipsey] And they ready to roll.

866
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:38,489
- And they're ready to roll.

867
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:41,901
So like if I'm a
billionaire and I take Russ

868
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:44,646
and we're co-partners 50/50
'cause I'm putting up the money,

869
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:46,426
we gotta rent arenas,
there's all that shit,

870
00:26:46,426 --> 00:26:48,012
'cause teams own their arenas but like --

871
00:26:48,012 --> 00:26:49,387
- [Nipsey] Start it off.

872
00:26:49,387 --> 00:26:52,841
- Not the NFL, not
baseball, not, but the NBA.

873
00:26:52,841 --> 00:26:55,633
If the top 14 guys left the league

874
00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:57,792
and started their own league,

875
00:26:57,792 --> 00:26:59,975
they'd break, they'd win.

876
00:26:59,975 --> 00:27:01,168
They've got the leverage.

877
00:27:01,168 --> 00:27:02,430
It's top heavy.

878
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,396
We aren't gonna fuck with a
league where the best player

879
00:27:05,396 --> 00:27:06,397
is Porzingis.

880
00:27:06,397 --> 00:27:07,452
- [Nipsey] Right. (laughs)

881
00:27:07,452 --> 00:27:08,436
- You know what I mean?

882
00:27:08,436 --> 00:27:10,112
And I love Zinger and
he's my future and my hope

883
00:27:10,112 --> 00:27:11,447
and I hope he's the best but like if you,

884
00:27:11,447 --> 00:27:14,789
if the number one player left
in the league is Paul George,

885
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:16,962
the NBA is not gonna
beat the other league.

886
00:27:16,962 --> 00:27:19,100
So that's why I fuck with --

887
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,413
- The model.

888
00:27:20,413 --> 00:27:21,804
- The model.

889
00:27:21,804 --> 00:27:22,805
What the Balls are doing.

890
00:27:22,805 --> 00:27:23,804
People don't understand.

891
00:27:23,804 --> 00:27:26,300
As technology continues to
change, the leverage changes.

892
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,787
- And it's not malicious to me.

893
00:27:28,787 --> 00:27:30,072
It's like --

894
00:27:30,072 --> 00:27:31,119
- It's business.

895
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:33,325
- It's what the moment demands.

896
00:27:33,325 --> 00:27:36,255
If you aware, you will
have to go at it like that.

897
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:37,257
- 100%.

898
00:27:37,257 --> 00:27:38,255
- It's not like I'm tryin' to --

899
00:27:38,255 --> 00:27:40,262
- And that's why I'm trying to push you

900
00:27:40,262 --> 00:27:43,222
and your young man here and
everybody to debate this idea

901
00:27:43,222 --> 00:27:46,363
if the world is in an
issue of supply and demand

902
00:27:46,363 --> 00:27:49,550
then why not have the thesis
of just fuckin' pounding out,

903
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,527
I have a man following me --

904
00:27:51,527 --> 00:27:52,780
- What do you mean by that?

905
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,918
What's the issue of supply and demand?

906
00:27:53,918 --> 00:27:56,859
- There is so much supply of
content that you can never

907
00:27:56,859 --> 00:27:58,961
be overexposed 'cause
everybody's gettin' pulled

908
00:27:58,961 --> 00:28:00,072
at so many directions.

909
00:28:00,072 --> 00:28:02,070
So the reason nobody wanted to put out

910
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,542
so much music before -
overexposure, overexposure.

911
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:05,667
That shit doesn't exist.

912
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:08,999
There's nobody overexposed
'cause everybody's getting pulled

913
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:09,999
in so many directions.

914
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:11,292
- So like you think
that people just evolve

915
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:12,305
to take in more info?

916
00:28:12,305 --> 00:28:15,308
- That's for damn sure but even at scale,

917
00:28:15,308 --> 00:28:19,558
I think that you can't be
overexposed as an artist

918
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:21,498
if you're capable about
putting out a song everyday.

919
00:28:21,498 --> 00:28:22,495
- Right.

920
00:28:22,495 --> 00:28:23,897
- And that's where
everyone's fucked up, right?

921
00:28:23,897 --> 00:28:25,058
You know how it used to be, right?

922
00:28:25,058 --> 00:28:26,508
You come out, you do your thing.

923
00:28:26,508 --> 00:28:29,106
Then you fuckin' disappear,
gotta keep that balance right.

924
00:28:29,106 --> 00:28:31,268
I think that shit's so competitive,

925
00:28:31,268 --> 00:28:33,768
there's so much great content.

926
00:28:34,861 --> 00:28:36,892
There's so much shit going on

927
00:28:36,892 --> 00:28:39,507
that if you've got it like that --

928
00:28:39,507 --> 00:28:40,504
- You gotta go.

929
00:28:40,504 --> 00:28:41,520
- You gotta go.

930
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,083
- But that's interesting
because if you look at what

931
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:44,216
may future pop,

932
00:28:44,216 --> 00:28:48,727
like shift gears and what may
like raw shift gears and like,

933
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,912
what's up, Shep --

934
00:28:49,912 --> 00:28:51,018
- What's up, man.

935
00:28:51,018 --> 00:28:52,013
- Tey, what up, bro.

936
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:53,011
So this, Shep.

937
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:53,990
This, Tey.

938
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,988
- [Gary] Shep, Tey.

939
00:28:54,988 --> 00:28:55,983
Gary.

940
00:28:55,983 --> 00:28:56,986
- What's up, bro.

941
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:57,987
Shep.

942
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:58,990
- What's up, man.

943
00:28:58,990 --> 00:28:59,992
My pleasure.

944
00:28:59,992 --> 00:29:01,002
How are you?

945
00:29:01,002 --> 00:29:02,000
Real pleasure.

946
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,021
- It was them pounding,
just droppin' music, bro.

947
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:04,020
They went music crazy.

948
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,019
- Droppin' music.

949
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:06,023
Look how much fuckin'
music Drake puts out.

950
00:29:06,023 --> 00:29:07,027
- Right.

951
00:29:07,027 --> 00:29:09,180
- That's a lot of fuckin'
music by standards

952
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,183
of what we all grew up with.

953
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:11,185
He's putting out more music in 24 months

954
00:29:11,185 --> 00:29:12,185
than people put out in their careers.

955
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:13,186
- I think the x factor is the quality.

956
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:15,428
If you can manufacture the quality --

957
00:29:15,428 --> 00:29:16,620
- Well, this comes down to talent, right?

958
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,028
- Right, right.

959
00:29:18,028 --> 00:29:19,277
- Like this is my thing with you -

960
00:29:19,277 --> 00:29:21,949
you gotta push the boundaries
of how talented, are you?

961
00:29:21,949 --> 00:29:23,780
- Right, I agree with you.

962
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,779
- Right?

963
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:27,769
Like just how talented are you?

964
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:29,393
There's always, like, like,

965
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,206
especially something
as culturally relevant

966
00:29:31,206 --> 00:29:32,784
and as passionate as art.

967
00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:33,853
You guys do art.

968
00:29:33,853 --> 00:29:37,078
Like if you've got it in you to do it,

969
00:29:37,078 --> 00:29:38,346
then you do it.

970
00:29:38,346 --> 00:29:39,856
- Yeah.

971
00:29:39,856 --> 00:29:40,859
- Some people don't.

972
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:41,859
Some people got different
processes, right?

973
00:29:41,859 --> 00:29:42,860
- Right.

974
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,861
- They gotta like,

975
00:29:43,861 --> 00:29:44,881
you can't force it but if you've got it --

976
00:29:44,881 --> 00:29:45,861
- Yeah, it's the --

977
00:29:45,861 --> 00:29:49,413
- If your notebook is full,
if it's full with bangers,

978
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,007
you need to put that shit out.

979
00:29:51,007 --> 00:29:52,007
- Right.

980
00:29:52,007 --> 00:29:53,786
- It can't be like Prince and you fuckin',

981
00:29:53,786 --> 00:29:54,841
when we find him dead,

982
00:29:54,841 --> 00:29:56,862
we go in a safe and there's 100
other great songs, you know?

983
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:57,909
- Right, right.

984
00:29:57,909 --> 00:29:58,968
- That day doesn't exist anymore.

985
00:29:58,968 --> 00:30:01,531
Him and MJ didn't have it
like, they couldn't do that,

986
00:30:01,531 --> 00:30:03,531
they had to wait every three
years to put out 11 of 'em

987
00:30:03,531 --> 00:30:04,705
'cause you're hacking distribution.

988
00:30:04,705 --> 00:30:05,704
- Right.

989
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,130
I didn't know that that's
what we was doing --

990
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,161
- That's what you're doing.

991
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:09,140
- And you know what's crazy?

992
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,139
Like my whole thing --

993
00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:11,158
- You know what's crazy?

994
00:30:11,158 --> 00:30:12,164
I apologize but I gotta say it.

995
00:30:12,164 --> 00:30:15,481
So my story is I grew up
in Edison, New Jersey.

996
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:16,482
Good mixed culture.

997
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,178
I'm 41 so I was there like,

998
00:30:18,178 --> 00:30:20,370
I was rockin' my Beastie Boys and all this

999
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,822
but then I went to Mount Ida College

1000
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:26,205
which was a 90% African
American college, right?

1001
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:27,629
That's where I really got into it.

1002
00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:29,506
That's when like, before the internet,

1003
00:30:29,506 --> 00:30:32,148
my friend Moose was
like, this is Scarface,

1004
00:30:32,148 --> 00:30:34,980
you need to know this and I was
like what the fuck? (laughs)

1005
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,400
It's funny.

1006
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,483
I am a super successful business man,

1007
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:44,464
I got D's and F's my whole
life and I still, to this day,

1008
00:30:44,464 --> 00:30:46,948
believe the people that most understand

1009
00:30:46,948 --> 00:30:49,618
how to hack distribution
are people that --

1010
00:30:49,618 --> 00:30:50,794
- [Nipsey] Hustlers.

1011
00:30:50,794 --> 00:30:51,959
Period.

1012
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:52,961
- Period.

1013
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:53,962
- [Nipsey] Period.

1014
00:30:53,962 --> 00:30:54,962
- Period.

1015
00:30:54,962 --> 00:30:55,962
I think it comes natural to you

1016
00:30:55,962 --> 00:30:57,584
'cause whether it's what's
rolled in your mouth right now

1017
00:30:57,584 --> 00:31:00,493
or whether it's a song, you're
always hacking distribution.

1018
00:31:00,493 --> 00:31:01,983
- [Nipsey] You know I used to call it?

1019
00:31:01,983 --> 00:31:03,612
Personality Sales Product Flows.

1020
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:04,445
- Yep.

1021
00:31:06,215 --> 00:31:07,753
- [Nipsey] And to me,

1022
00:31:07,753 --> 00:31:09,920
when I used to go hand to hand and grind,

1023
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,526
I used to bootleg CD's,

1024
00:31:12,526 --> 00:31:14,631
I used to sell a lot of
this shit to drugs too.

1025
00:31:14,631 --> 00:31:15,632
My CD,

1026
00:31:15,632 --> 00:31:18,641
I used to sell and I used to
have to distinguish myself

1027
00:31:18,641 --> 00:31:19,717
for five seconds.

1028
00:31:19,717 --> 00:31:21,392
So I used to be like
bro, if this is garbage,

1029
00:31:21,392 --> 00:31:23,787
throw it out the window and
that would make 'em be like,

1030
00:31:23,787 --> 00:31:24,890
let me see this shit.

1031
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:25,889
You feel me?

1032
00:31:25,889 --> 00:31:27,378
If it's trash, throw
that shit out the window

1033
00:31:27,378 --> 00:31:28,469
right in front of me, I ain't trippin'.

1034
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,513
Just listen.

1035
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:30,509
You feel me?

1036
00:31:30,509 --> 00:31:31,509
And it's free.

1037
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:32,510
Check it out.

1038
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,517
You know, if it's boo boo,

1039
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,517
throw that shit out the window, bro.

1040
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,517
- [Gary] Humility.

1041
00:31:35,517 --> 00:31:36,517
- And just --

1042
00:31:36,517 --> 00:31:37,517
- Humility is the fuckin' anchor.

1043
00:31:37,517 --> 00:31:38,519
- [Nipsey] Right and even just like --

1044
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,218
- You know how to talk
to your audience though.

1045
00:31:40,218 --> 00:31:42,002
- [Nipsey] And that's more
important than the product.

1046
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:43,045
- 'Cause you reverse engineered

1047
00:31:43,045 --> 00:31:44,230
the way you would've reacted.

1048
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,229
- [Nipsey] Exactly.

1049
00:31:45,229 --> 00:31:46,226
- 100%.

1050
00:31:46,226 --> 00:31:47,905
- [Nipsey] And I think every
time we have a release,

1051
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:49,739
when you was talking about
marketing, if I love marketing,

1052
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:52,746
and I think that you
gotta reverse engineer

1053
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:53,743
how you would --

1054
00:31:53,743 --> 00:31:54,762
- How are you guys
thinking about the fuckin',

1055
00:31:54,762 --> 00:31:57,343
the mutation of hip hop?

1056
00:31:57,343 --> 00:31:59,406
Like so that's what's
real interesting to me.

1057
00:31:59,406 --> 00:32:02,123
You got a lot of youngsters in this room

1058
00:32:02,123 --> 00:32:04,504
but like the era that I grew up in,

1059
00:32:04,504 --> 00:32:06,127
there was one narrative, right?

1060
00:32:06,127 --> 00:32:09,209
If you weren't hard, you
made up that you were.

1061
00:32:09,209 --> 00:32:11,277
That's why so many guys
lost 'cause they had to.

1062
00:32:11,277 --> 00:32:13,112
There was no angles for,

1063
00:32:13,112 --> 00:32:14,267
there was nobody dressing
like you're dressing now.

1064
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:16,196
Like when Bentley came
out with those umbrellas,

1065
00:32:16,196 --> 00:32:17,350
everybody's like what?

1066
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,601
Now it's mutating, right?

1067
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:20,793
Like now shit is getting so, it's great,

1068
00:32:20,793 --> 00:32:22,512
'cause now it's the fabric of our culture.

1069
00:32:22,512 --> 00:32:25,601
Like to me, hip hop is
the fabric of our culture,

1070
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:27,193
like America.

1071
00:32:27,193 --> 00:32:31,166
What that means is it's
mutating so it really,

1072
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,418
it's more fruitful for the real artists,

1073
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,050
the one that have humility, the one,

1074
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,324
like I'm waiting for
like, who's the hip hop,

1075
00:32:37,324 --> 00:32:39,567
who's the guy or girl
at the top of the game

1076
00:32:39,567 --> 00:32:41,965
that embraces country music stars?

1077
00:32:41,965 --> 00:32:44,128
Who's at the top of the game that like,

1078
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,927
there's so many hacks
still left to be had.

1079
00:32:46,927 --> 00:32:48,938
It's real interesting.

1080
00:32:48,938 --> 00:32:50,554
It's real interesting to me.

1081
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:53,348
Like everything's just like
mutating into each other.

1082
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:55,646
Like if you really look at hip hop,

1083
00:32:55,646 --> 00:32:57,526
it's crazy that hip hop absorbed

1084
00:32:57,526 --> 00:33:00,470
like white nerd culture, right?

1085
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:04,637
Like you wouldn't be wearing
those glasses 15 years ago.

1086
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:08,486
Now way, you would fuckin'
rather be blind as shit

1087
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,751
if you didn't have contacts.

1088
00:33:09,751 --> 00:33:12,149
Like it's really interesting
if you really look at it.

1089
00:33:12,149 --> 00:33:14,509
I think there's a lot of
white space in that, a lot.

1090
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:17,009
You know what I'd love to see?

1091
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:20,441
You know what would blow my mind,

1092
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:21,274
is if I heard you went to
Chattanooga, Tennessee,

1093
00:33:21,274 --> 00:33:24,274
set up shop and fuckin' did it there

1094
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:26,956
and like fuckin' brought in local,

1095
00:33:26,956 --> 00:33:28,158
there's a lot of hacks
still left to be done.

1096
00:33:28,158 --> 00:33:32,075
- You saying Chattanooga
'cause tech hot spots?

1097
00:33:33,714 --> 00:33:35,974
- Mm Hmm (affirmative),
Nashville and Chattanooga.

1098
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:37,319
Like there's just shit to be done.

1099
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,376
(group chattering)

1100
00:33:38,376 --> 00:33:39,505
- [Male] Yeah, Gilmore.

1101
00:33:39,505 --> 00:33:40,704
- [Nipsey] Ron in Nashville.

1102
00:33:40,704 --> 00:33:42,079
- [Male] Ron Gilmore and them?

1103
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:46,246
- Yeah, Ron Gilmore's
fuckin', he's done a good job.

1104
00:33:48,081 --> 00:33:49,082
You're right.

1105
00:33:49,082 --> 00:33:51,566
- Yeah, like there's still frontiers --

1106
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:53,587
- Like it hasn't even started, right?

1107
00:33:53,587 --> 00:33:56,206
Just like it hasn't even started.

1108
00:33:56,206 --> 00:33:58,034
I think a lot of people in hip hop,

1109
00:33:58,034 --> 00:34:00,395
especially if you're born
from it, you're in it,

1110
00:34:00,395 --> 00:34:03,585
I think are underestimating
how much it is fundamentally

1111
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:06,000
the underlining current of our society.

1112
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,652
- I mean the jig is up.

1113
00:34:08,652 --> 00:34:09,775
I think it's pretty clear.

1114
00:34:09,775 --> 00:34:12,677
All the stats came out
recently about streaming

1115
00:34:12,677 --> 00:34:14,891
and about the biggest genre is hip hop

1116
00:34:14,891 --> 00:34:16,334
so that's not just your instinct,

1117
00:34:16,335 --> 00:34:17,810
that's a fact now too.

1118
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:18,808
- I think so too.

1119
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:20,331
I just don't think that
people have really realized

1120
00:34:20,331 --> 00:34:22,099
that like every politician,
every tech developer,

1121
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:23,429
like every entrepreneur --

1122
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,442
- They hope we ain't realized it.

1123
00:34:24,443 --> 00:34:25,443
They know.

1124
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:26,440
- That's 100%.

1125
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,446
- Yeah know.

1126
00:34:27,447 --> 00:34:28,447
- By the way that I can guarantee you.

1127
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:30,565
- They just hoping that
the content creators

1128
00:34:30,565 --> 00:34:32,553
don't feel like what you
just said, is a fact.

1129
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:33,687
- Cat's outta bag, man.

1130
00:34:33,687 --> 00:34:35,210
That fuckin', it's fuckin' over.

1131
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:39,853
Like now it's just a matter
of time, matter of time.

1132
00:34:39,853 --> 00:34:42,849
- What you feel about direct
to consumer as far as like,

1133
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:44,077
not just music.

1134
00:34:44,077 --> 00:34:45,117
- Everything?

1135
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:46,733
- In terms of retail, in
terms of just business.

1136
00:34:46,733 --> 00:34:47,723
- So that's all I'm doing.

1137
00:34:47,723 --> 00:34:48,906
I'm building a machine.

1138
00:34:48,906 --> 00:34:50,476
I have 800 employees,

1139
00:34:50,476 --> 00:34:52,755
building a machine to
go direct to consumer

1140
00:34:52,755 --> 00:34:54,190
but I've got a little
bit of a different bet.

1141
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:57,500
So instead of starting a new bottled water

1142
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,039
or starting a new deodorant,

1143
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:00,106
'cause I'm gonna buy businesses,

1144
00:35:00,106 --> 00:35:02,390
I'm a big believer that nostalgia

1145
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,987
and IP is grossly underrated.

1146
00:35:04,987 --> 00:35:08,806
So Marvel was a bankrupt
comic book company

1147
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:10,452
but when they took the business

1148
00:35:10,452 --> 00:35:13,052
and they made it into movies,
it was worth a trilly.

1149
00:35:13,052 --> 00:35:15,083
- Yeah, it was value floating --

1150
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:19,080
- So like I think what's
happening in the sneaker game,

1151
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,865
I'm fascinated how fucked Nike really is

1152
00:35:21,865 --> 00:35:23,787
because you can just see it

1153
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:26,665
but I think if you watch
carefully, everything's in place.

1154
00:35:26,665 --> 00:35:27,731
Like I wanna buy Keds.

1155
00:35:27,731 --> 00:35:29,148
I wanna buy Pony.

1156
00:35:30,103 --> 00:35:31,187
- All nostalgia, I get you.

1157
00:35:31,187 --> 00:35:32,478
- All nostalgia because right?

1158
00:35:32,478 --> 00:35:36,504
Because once it meant something
it's worth a lot more money

1159
00:35:36,504 --> 00:35:37,506
than people think.

1160
00:35:37,506 --> 00:35:38,914
You could start something
tomorrow called N's

1161
00:35:38,914 --> 00:35:43,617
but if you bought Keds
and rocked them properly

1162
00:35:43,617 --> 00:35:44,617
and created distribution,

1163
00:35:44,617 --> 00:35:46,133
it would speed up the process.

1164
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:47,313
Exactly what's gonna happen.

1165
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:48,295
- That's right.

1166
00:35:48,295 --> 00:35:49,722
Yeah, I believe in that.

1167
00:35:49,722 --> 00:35:51,578
- So that's really on my mind.

1168
00:35:51,578 --> 00:35:53,578
Vans, I'm just like now,

1169
00:35:54,797 --> 00:35:56,480
basically I walk through the airport

1170
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,994
and only lookin' at people's sneakers.

1171
00:35:57,994 --> 00:35:59,200
I'm not even looking --

1172
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,603
- It's changing right now
'cause I don't buy the same shit

1173
00:36:02,603 --> 00:36:03,604
I used to buy.

1174
00:36:03,604 --> 00:36:04,619
- That's it.

1175
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:05,677
- I don't got the same taste I used to.

1176
00:36:05,677 --> 00:36:07,793
- I can't even believe how
much trouble Nike's in.

1177
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:10,034
I couldn't even think about
wearing something else.

1178
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,703
- I think they got arrogant though.

1179
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:12,838
- Of course they got arrogant.

1180
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:13,837
Everybody gets arrogant.

1181
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:15,151
- Yeah, 'cause that shit.

1182
00:36:15,151 --> 00:36:16,443
I saw their designs go trash, bro.

1183
00:36:16,443 --> 00:36:17,436
Even Foot Locker,

1184
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:19,015
just the whole Foot
Locker store turned trash.

1185
00:36:19,015 --> 00:36:20,877
You used to go get fresh at Foot Locker.

1186
00:36:20,877 --> 00:36:23,219
You could go buy fresh
shoes at Foot Locker.

1187
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:25,221
That shit is garbage in their now.

1188
00:36:25,221 --> 00:36:26,718
Everything look like --

1189
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:27,866
- [Male] Garbage.

1190
00:36:27,866 --> 00:36:29,799
(group laughing)

1191
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:31,332
- Just like 10 million copies
of these two pair of Nikes.

1192
00:36:31,332 --> 00:36:32,406
- [Sophie] Right.

1193
00:36:32,406 --> 00:36:33,458
- And they put 'em all over --

1194
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:34,456
- The other thing is the cat's outta bag.

1195
00:36:34,456 --> 00:36:35,475
I'm looking at you right now.

1196
00:36:35,475 --> 00:36:36,473
That Champion,

1197
00:36:36,473 --> 00:36:38,218
like if Champion puts
out a sneaker tomorrow

1198
00:36:38,218 --> 00:36:40,974
and it's fly as fuck and they
got the right influencer,

1199
00:36:40,974 --> 00:36:44,058
the right hip hop star, the
right cultural fuckin' person,

1200
00:36:44,058 --> 00:36:45,245
it's in the game.

1201
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:47,304
- Yeah, you 100% on
point with the nostalgia.

1202
00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:49,508
- [Male] People are wearing
Champion like regular shit.

1203
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:50,513
- I see it!

1204
00:36:50,513 --> 00:36:51,518
I see it!

1205
00:36:51,518 --> 00:36:52,524
(group chattering)

1206
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:56,191
- Look at Puff and his
era with music right?

1207
00:36:57,689 --> 00:37:00,418
It was 20 years later and
they sampled the 70's.

1208
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,949
- 100%, that's how it works.

1209
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:04,839
- It's 20 years later, they
samplin' the 90's right now.

1210
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:06,256
That's why all them brands is in.

1211
00:37:06,256 --> 00:37:07,545
- Puma.

1212
00:37:07,545 --> 00:37:09,757
- All them 90's, Starter's a 90's brand.

1213
00:37:09,757 --> 00:37:10,761
- 100%.

1214
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:11,910
- Fila's a 90's brand.

1215
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:12,966
- You know who's ready?

1216
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:14,789
Timbo boots are ready to come back, right?

1217
00:37:14,789 --> 00:37:15,788
- We doin' a Timbo collab.

1218
00:37:15,788 --> 00:37:16,621
- Are you?

1219
00:37:17,506 --> 00:37:18,529
- Yeah.

1220
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:19,902
- Timbo, that would be
a business I would buy.

1221
00:37:19,902 --> 00:37:21,983
- That's a billion dollar
company, by the way.

1222
00:37:21,983 --> 00:37:23,234
They own Sketchers.

1223
00:37:23,234 --> 00:37:24,235
- I'm aware.

1224
00:37:24,235 --> 00:37:25,968
They're huge but based on my thesis

1225
00:37:25,968 --> 00:37:27,602
that hip hop rules the world,

1226
00:37:27,602 --> 00:37:29,821
it's probably a $50 billion company --

1227
00:37:29,821 --> 00:37:30,824
- Hold on, stop right there.

1228
00:37:30,824 --> 00:37:31,931
What's your thesis?

1229
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:32,942
- Hip hop rules the world.

1230
00:37:32,942 --> 00:37:34,134
- Fuckin' with you, bro.

1231
00:37:34,134 --> 00:37:35,137
(group laughs)

1232
00:37:35,137 --> 00:37:36,864
That's how I really feel.

1233
00:37:36,864 --> 00:37:39,200
I swear to God, if you hear the album,

1234
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,772
my album thesis is hip hop rule the world.

1235
00:37:40,772 --> 00:37:42,995
All I gotta do is make
100% off any hip hop album,

1236
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:43,995
I'm global.

1237
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:44,995
I don't care what nobody tell me.

1238
00:37:44,995 --> 00:37:47,327
I don't care what no
person tells me on earth.

1239
00:37:47,327 --> 00:37:48,572
All I gotta do is make the most 100%

1240
00:37:48,572 --> 00:37:50,699
authentic hip hop album
right now, I'm global.

1241
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:52,874
- While I got you guys here,
let me throw something at you.

1242
00:37:52,874 --> 00:37:54,062
Do you like traveling or no?

1243
00:37:54,062 --> 00:37:55,546
- I love traveling.

1244
00:37:55,546 --> 00:37:57,935
- Well, some people, homebody,
I gotta ask the questions.

1245
00:37:57,935 --> 00:37:59,116
- I got a daughter.

1246
00:37:59,116 --> 00:38:00,388
I miss my kid when I travel so --

1247
00:38:00,388 --> 00:38:01,418
- Okay, well that's why I'm askin'.

1248
00:38:01,418 --> 00:38:02,482
One of the things that you guys

1249
00:38:02,482 --> 00:38:03,826
should be thinking a lot about,

1250
00:38:03,826 --> 00:38:05,197
seeing you guys film, marketing.

1251
00:38:05,197 --> 00:38:06,301
I've been paying attention.

1252
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:07,322
Boyd's been telling me stuff.

1253
00:38:07,322 --> 00:38:10,524
What people don't, here's
what I would do if I were you,

1254
00:38:10,524 --> 00:38:12,474
take some of the money you
make and whatever you're doing,

1255
00:38:12,474 --> 00:38:13,477
the store, music.

1256
00:38:13,477 --> 00:38:15,892
You guys should pick four countries -

1257
00:38:15,892 --> 00:38:17,309
Portugal, Brazil.

1258
00:38:18,773 --> 00:38:20,089
Pick four countries.

1259
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:24,056
- Like top markets or
like obscure countries?

1260
00:38:24,056 --> 00:38:25,498
- Honestly, you're so creative, I'm not,

1261
00:38:25,498 --> 00:38:27,597
normally I would be like pick this.

1262
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:28,835
I'm gonna let it flow here.

1263
00:38:28,835 --> 00:38:30,045
I wanna see what you're about to do.

1264
00:38:30,045 --> 00:38:32,536
Pick four markets, right
'cause you might say,

1265
00:38:32,536 --> 00:38:34,074
my grandma's from there, I don't know,

1266
00:38:34,074 --> 00:38:35,157
just pick four countries.

1267
00:38:35,157 --> 00:38:36,139
- I would definitely go to the
country that my dad's from,

1268
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:37,317
that would be on the list.

1269
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:38,299
- Where is that?

1270
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:39,323
- Eritrea, it's in East Africa.

1271
00:38:39,323 --> 00:38:40,326
- Love it.

1272
00:38:40,326 --> 00:38:42,860
Pick four countries with
Facebook and Instagram ads

1273
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:47,752
and I'm talking five, $10,000
a month on four countries.

1274
00:38:47,752 --> 00:38:48,585
You can,

1275
00:38:49,696 --> 00:38:51,229
people don't realize how
global the world's getting.

1276
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:53,560
People don't understand
how inexpensive this is.

1277
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,653
Like I went to Hong Kong
and by the third day,

1278
00:38:55,653 --> 00:38:57,215
I'm like on a pedestal.

1279
00:38:57,215 --> 00:39:00,432
America is still the number
one brand in the world.

1280
00:39:00,432 --> 00:39:01,490
- Absolutely.

1281
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,490
- America.

1282
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:03,708
- Culture.

1283
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,633
- Correct and so for you
to just pick Indonesia

1284
00:39:05,633 --> 00:39:09,337
and fuck with it, run ads
on all your little videos,

1285
00:39:09,337 --> 00:39:12,048
play that music down, bang
'em, bang 'em, bang 'em.

1286
00:39:12,048 --> 00:39:13,231
- What was we just talkin' about?

1287
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:16,976
What was we talkin' about pulling
up in London and all that?

1288
00:39:16,976 --> 00:39:19,727
Like we just need to pull up
and touchdown and fuck around.

1289
00:39:19,727 --> 00:39:20,741
- Now London, it's noisy.

1290
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:23,142
You see where I'm going?

1291
00:39:23,142 --> 00:39:25,637
That's why I'm like pick
Portugal, pick I mean --

1292
00:39:25,637 --> 00:39:28,377
- [Male] The Philippines,
no know one touches --

1293
00:39:28,377 --> 00:39:30,314
- And you know how much
Philippines ads are?

1294
00:39:30,314 --> 00:39:31,315
Three cents.

1295
00:39:31,315 --> 00:39:33,319
Like you'll get everybody
and then all of a sudden,

1296
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:34,935
here's how it works, right?

1297
00:39:34,935 --> 00:39:36,254
You do the Philippines, it kills.

1298
00:39:36,254 --> 00:39:38,348
Now fuckin' Manny Pacquiao
and you are doing,

1299
00:39:38,348 --> 00:39:41,332
like you gotta hack, hack, hack attention.

1300
00:39:41,332 --> 00:39:44,029
Hack attention and like
there's so much white space --

1301
00:39:44,029 --> 00:39:47,289
- What you mean by white space, unexposed?

1302
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:48,288
- That's correct.

1303
00:39:48,288 --> 00:39:51,737
Nobody owns Peru and now
somebody will be like,

1304
00:39:51,737 --> 00:39:54,834
well, Peru, but you don'
realize like then you go find

1305
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:56,149
some artist there and put them on,

1306
00:39:56,149 --> 00:39:57,795
like there's so much of that.

1307
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:59,524
Right, what's that song that fuckin',

1308
00:39:59,524 --> 00:40:01,145
the number one streamed song now

1309
00:40:01,145 --> 00:40:02,383
like my daughter's singing all day,

1310
00:40:02,383 --> 00:40:04,240
the fuckin' Beiber and the Latino --

1311
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,241
- [Boyd] Despacito.

1312
00:40:05,241 --> 00:40:06,377
- Yeah, that's hacking culture.

1313
00:40:06,377 --> 00:40:08,178
That guy was fucking hot
down there but not here.

1314
00:40:08,178 --> 00:40:09,408
Uh huh, uh huh.

1315
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:12,919
(group chattering)

1316
00:40:12,919 --> 00:40:14,572
You know, that kind of
stuff and when you're like

1317
00:40:14,572 --> 00:40:16,136
this creative and this entrepreneurial,

1318
00:40:16,136 --> 00:40:16,969
that shit makes sense.

1319
00:40:16,969 --> 00:40:17,802
- Absolutely.

1320
00:40:17,802 --> 00:40:18,635
- Like you can reverse
engineer or you can see

1321
00:40:18,635 --> 00:40:20,942
what's actually, there's just a,

1322
00:40:20,942 --> 00:40:21,950
it's reverse engineering.

1323
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,987
- And what's crazy,

1324
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,677
they all coming onto
the internet right now.

1325
00:40:24,677 --> 00:40:25,678
- Well, that's it.

1326
00:40:25,678 --> 00:40:26,838
Everybody's, everything's mixing.

1327
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:28,201
- Yeah.

1328
00:40:28,201 --> 00:40:29,611
- Everything's mixing.

1329
00:40:29,611 --> 00:40:31,045
That's what I mean with like white nerd,

1330
00:40:31,045 --> 00:40:32,595
like literally for somebody that's 41

1331
00:40:32,595 --> 00:40:34,215
that watches culture
every minute of his life,

1332
00:40:34,215 --> 00:40:35,369
I cannot believe,

1333
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:39,536
cannot believe that like
N.W.A. merged with Urkel.

1334
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:42,921
That's what happened.

1335
00:40:42,921 --> 00:40:43,926
- [Nipsey] What you mean by that?

1336
00:40:43,926 --> 00:40:45,673
- I mean fuckin' if you look at 1991.

1337
00:40:45,673 --> 00:40:46,671
If you're --

1338
00:40:46,671 --> 00:40:47,673
- [Nipsey] Oh, in terms of hip hop.

1339
00:40:47,673 --> 00:40:49,872
- Yeah, like 2017 hip
hop is actually Urkel

1340
00:40:49,872 --> 00:40:52,970
and fuckin' Ice Cube in 1992 having a baby

1341
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:55,062
and nobody would've thought that.

1342
00:40:55,062 --> 00:40:56,812
Like that's how, go ahead.

1343
00:40:56,812 --> 00:41:00,564
- I think that that's in
terms of where the world is.

1344
00:41:00,564 --> 00:41:02,302
The world is at a transitional point

1345
00:41:02,302 --> 00:41:04,874
and the message in culture is so powerful

1346
00:41:04,874 --> 00:41:07,872
that a destructive message at this point,

1347
00:41:07,872 --> 00:41:10,205
I don't believe could exist.

1348
00:41:11,573 --> 00:41:14,472
I think that Drake was needed
on some love balance the world

1349
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,939
'cause I grew up when 50
Cent was the hottest shit,

1350
00:41:16,939 --> 00:41:18,053
we was shootin' shit, bro.

1351
00:41:18,053 --> 00:41:19,230
You know what I mean?

1352
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,229
- [Gary] That's right.

1353
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:21,237
I remember.

1354
00:41:21,237 --> 00:41:22,764
- It was gun culture and the
music influenced the streets.

1355
00:41:22,764 --> 00:41:25,465
Now everybody got a
girlfriend and got tattoos

1356
00:41:25,465 --> 00:41:26,482
and (inaudible).

1357
00:41:26,482 --> 00:41:27,878
You know what I'm sayin'?

1358
00:41:27,878 --> 00:41:29,733
Because the culture was that influential

1359
00:41:29,733 --> 00:41:32,592
and I think that like the
world is like transitioning.

1360
00:41:32,592 --> 00:41:34,496
You familiar with like physics?

1361
00:41:34,496 --> 00:41:35,583
I don't wanna go way crazy --

1362
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:36,416
- [Gary] Go ahead.

1363
00:41:36,416 --> 00:41:37,249
- So they're looking in space

1364
00:41:37,249 --> 00:41:39,168
and seeing where they're
drawing their energy

1365
00:41:39,168 --> 00:41:40,477
to see what type of civilization they are

1366
00:41:40,477 --> 00:41:42,715
so if you're getting your energy

1367
00:41:42,715 --> 00:41:44,934
from the planets you live on,

1368
00:41:44,934 --> 00:41:45,937
you're a type zero civilization.

1369
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:46,937
- Okay.

1370
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:47,944
- That's earth.

1371
00:41:47,944 --> 00:41:48,944
- Yep.

1372
00:41:48,944 --> 00:41:51,104
- But we at a point of
transition going to type one

1373
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,059
because we are getting into solar energy.

1374
00:41:53,059 --> 00:41:56,886
We are harnessing the
atmosphere's energy right now

1375
00:41:56,886 --> 00:41:57,886
so we are transitioning.

1376
00:41:57,886 --> 00:42:00,455
In terms of physics,
when they explore space,

1377
00:42:00,455 --> 00:42:04,729
they would say that a
civilization that harnesses energy

1378
00:42:04,729 --> 00:42:06,161
from their atmosphere is type one.

1379
00:42:06,161 --> 00:42:07,195
- Understood.

1380
00:42:07,195 --> 00:42:11,465
- So we transition and Michio
Kaku's theory, not mine,

1381
00:42:11,465 --> 00:42:12,445
this is what he said --

1382
00:42:12,445 --> 00:42:13,463
- I'm listening.

1383
00:42:13,463 --> 00:42:17,175
- Is that what's happening is
that there's a technological

1384
00:42:17,175 --> 00:42:21,342
evolution that's ahead of
the compassion evolution

1385
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:27,632
or the spiritual evolution
which is, in a way,

1386
00:42:27,632 --> 00:42:29,157
it's moving up the vegan
movement all these things

1387
00:42:29,157 --> 00:42:30,502
trying to catch up to the technology

1388
00:42:30,502 --> 00:42:33,134
'cause we got nuclear
bombs and everybody's armed

1389
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,278
and we can commit planetary suicide.

1390
00:42:35,278 --> 00:42:38,159
So what has to balance that is the culture

1391
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:40,180
and that's why Drake is the biggest.

1392
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:43,887
I think and love is the
movement and togetherness --

1393
00:42:43,887 --> 00:42:45,278
- Positivity always wins at the end, man.

1394
00:42:45,278 --> 00:42:47,789
This shit is so basic.

1395
00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:51,674
When I look at what's going
on in the social realms,

1396
00:42:51,674 --> 00:42:53,073
positivity always beat,

1397
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:54,626
negativity always wins the short game

1398
00:42:54,626 --> 00:42:57,272
and positivity always wins the long game.

1399
00:42:57,272 --> 00:42:58,271
- Right.

1400
00:42:58,271 --> 00:43:00,202
- It's easier to be cynical
upfront and negative

1401
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,647
and people react to it, like
that's what you see on social,

1402
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:03,804
all negative, negative,

1403
00:43:03,804 --> 00:43:07,805
like people would rather clown
on LeBron than praise Steph.

1404
00:43:07,805 --> 00:43:10,333
It's negativity short term but long term,

1405
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:11,582
positivity always wins.

1406
00:43:11,582 --> 00:43:12,415
Always.

1407
00:43:13,445 --> 00:43:15,508
The human race just figures this shit out.

1408
00:43:15,508 --> 00:43:16,798
I'm always on team human.

1409
00:43:16,798 --> 00:43:17,856
- [Nipsey] Right.

1410
00:43:17,856 --> 00:43:19,732
- We could've been gone a long time ago.

1411
00:43:19,732 --> 00:43:20,731
- [Nipsey] Right.

1412
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:21,872
- I agree.

1413
00:43:21,872 --> 00:43:22,872
- Yeah, man.

1414
00:43:24,153 --> 00:43:27,736
I think it's exciting right now though.

1415
00:43:27,736 --> 00:43:29,361
That's why I'm kinda going slow.

1416
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:31,353
As much as people tryin' to rush me,

1417
00:43:31,353 --> 00:43:33,546
I'm goin' slow 'cause
I think that we ain't,

1418
00:43:33,546 --> 00:43:34,635
there's no reason to rush.

1419
00:43:34,635 --> 00:43:36,339
I think all the
opportunities are unfolding.

1420
00:43:36,339 --> 00:43:39,340
- So SnapChat is a wild moment right now

1421
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,507
'cause you know how it is,

1422
00:43:42,837 --> 00:43:44,639
people overreact in each direction.

1423
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:46,540
Everybody's like clowning on it

1424
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,857
'cause the stock's not doing well

1425
00:43:47,857 --> 00:43:49,677
and Instagram copied all its features.

1426
00:43:49,677 --> 00:43:53,844
Meanwhile $3 CPM and kids are
watching content at scale.

1427
00:43:54,735 --> 00:43:55,736
Like under 30 --

1428
00:43:55,736 --> 00:43:56,738
- What does that mean?

1429
00:43:56,738 --> 00:43:57,737
What does CPM mean?

1430
00:43:57,737 --> 00:43:59,352
- Cost per thousand impressions.

1431
00:43:59,352 --> 00:44:01,808
So you know, they're
gonna spend ad dollars,

1432
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:02,806
your partner, right?

1433
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,179
- So $3 per --

1434
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:05,772
- $3 per thousand.

1435
00:44:05,772 --> 00:44:08,932
It's nothing and more
importantly, on SnapChat,

1436
00:44:08,932 --> 00:44:11,694
you have depth not just
width so this is in pre-rolls

1437
00:44:11,694 --> 00:44:13,773
on fuckin' ESPN.com that
nobody gives a fuck about.

1438
00:44:13,773 --> 00:44:16,210
People are seeing content in the middle

1439
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:20,658
and then when they're
engaging, it's at scale.

1440
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,069
So when you guys talk
and if I can be of help,

1441
00:44:23,069 --> 00:44:24,577
if anyone wants to follow up with detail,

1442
00:44:24,577 --> 00:44:27,756
SnapChat is grossly underpriced right now.

1443
00:44:27,756 --> 00:44:28,761
- For marketing.

1444
00:44:28,761 --> 00:44:30,519
- Uh huh, grossly underpriced.

1445
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:31,543
- And what is that --

1446
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,179
- Because everybody's a
headline reader, right?

1447
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:34,629
Everyone's like oh,
Instagram killed SnapChat.

1448
00:44:34,629 --> 00:44:36,842
Go open your app store right now.

1449
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:38,312
Tell me where SnapChat's ranked.

1450
00:44:38,312 --> 00:44:39,885
- What does a SnapChat ad look like?

1451
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,375
It's a five second clip or something?

1452
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:42,448
- It can be yeah, it's a 10 second,

1453
00:44:42,448 --> 00:44:43,714
in between like you're kinda like

1454
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:45,228
clicking everybody's
stories and then you'll pop

1455
00:44:45,228 --> 00:44:47,040
and then with you, like
you should be like yeah,

1456
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,247
you know what's funny?

1457
00:44:48,247 --> 00:44:49,252
You know what's funny?

1458
00:44:49,252 --> 00:44:51,333
You should exactly do
exactly what the fuck you did

1459
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:52,776
when you were slingin'
your shit and being like

1460
00:44:52,776 --> 00:44:53,849
yo, swipe up.

1461
00:44:53,849 --> 00:44:55,314
Listen, if you don't like it.

1462
00:44:55,314 --> 00:44:56,315
Fuck, that's it.

1463
00:44:56,315 --> 00:44:57,588
You should fuckin'
refuckin' do that same shit.

1464
00:44:57,588 --> 00:45:00,049
You just look right in
the camera and be like,

1465
00:45:00,049 --> 00:45:02,147
yo, swipe up and listen
to it and if not, fuck it.

1466
00:45:02,147 --> 00:45:05,359
(group laughs)

1467
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,361
Right?

1468
00:45:06,361 --> 00:45:07,572
That is super underpriced.

1469
00:45:07,572 --> 00:45:10,879
That can hack and everybody trades on,

1470
00:45:10,879 --> 00:45:12,596
everybody's headline reading.

1471
00:45:12,596 --> 00:45:13,828
Oh, Instragram's winning.

1472
00:45:13,828 --> 00:45:15,490
They're not looking at the details.

1473
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:19,514
- Yeah, they got a smug
campaign on SnapChat right now.

1474
00:45:19,514 --> 00:45:22,185
- We got so much running
on SnapChat right now

1475
00:45:22,185 --> 00:45:23,161
'cause it's underpriced.

1476
00:45:23,161 --> 00:45:24,174
- No, I said a smear campaign.

1477
00:45:24,174 --> 00:45:25,173
- Oh, who?

1478
00:45:25,173 --> 00:45:26,171
- Just the press they talking about --

1479
00:45:26,171 --> 00:45:27,407
- Yeah, yeah, well
listen, they deserve it.

1480
00:45:27,407 --> 00:45:28,596
They got punched in the fuckin' mouth.

1481
00:45:28,596 --> 00:45:29,635
- And their IPO.

1482
00:45:29,635 --> 00:45:30,653
- Killed.

1483
00:45:30,653 --> 00:45:33,963
But I'm buying now 'cause it
went too far the other way.

1484
00:45:33,963 --> 00:45:34,972
- Right.

1485
00:45:34,972 --> 00:45:35,986
- Right?

1486
00:45:35,986 --> 00:45:36,987
'Cause everyone here living like,

1487
00:45:36,987 --> 00:45:38,786
there's plenty of fuckin'
people on SnapChat.

1488
00:45:38,786 --> 00:45:41,135
- Cal is still talking to
his flowers every morning.

1489
00:45:41,135 --> 00:45:42,142
(group laughs)

1490
00:45:42,142 --> 00:45:45,059
(group chattering)

1491
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:49,011
- That's how I built my whole career.

1492
00:45:49,011 --> 00:45:50,586
I answered every single person

1493
00:45:50,586 --> 00:45:55,568
that engaged with me on
Twitter from 2007 to 2011.

1494
00:45:55,568 --> 00:45:56,567
All of 'em.

1495
00:45:56,567 --> 00:45:57,817
18 hours a day.

1496
00:45:59,397 --> 00:46:02,122
Every single person
and so that one on one,

1497
00:46:02,122 --> 00:46:03,365
it's depth.

1498
00:46:03,365 --> 00:46:04,926
Everybody's worried about width.

1499
00:46:04,926 --> 00:46:06,377
It's all about depth.

1500
00:46:06,377 --> 00:46:07,986
- Right, I agree with that 100%.

1501
00:46:07,986 --> 00:46:10,161
- And if you got the energy to grind,

1502
00:46:10,161 --> 00:46:12,600
well then you can go wide and deep.

1503
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,600
- Absolutely.

1504
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,603
- I don't understand how all these artists

1505
00:46:16,603 --> 00:46:18,061
have nobody give a fuck about them,

1506
00:46:18,061 --> 00:46:20,041
they put out a post on Instagram,

1507
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:21,796
they have 11 people that give them love

1508
00:46:21,796 --> 00:46:23,663
and they can't even reply to those people?

1509
00:46:23,663 --> 00:46:24,996
You got no fans.

1510
00:46:25,835 --> 00:46:27,274
Who the fuck you think you are?

1511
00:46:27,274 --> 00:46:28,437
- They got a celebrity complex.

1512
00:46:28,437 --> 00:46:30,516
That's what's stopping 'em.

1513
00:46:30,516 --> 00:46:32,316
- You know that the
biggest thing I took away

1514
00:46:32,316 --> 00:46:33,745
from the meeting with The Rock just now?

1515
00:46:33,745 --> 00:46:36,415
Let's call it what it
is, The Rock has won.

1516
00:46:36,415 --> 00:46:37,483
He's at the,

1517
00:46:37,483 --> 00:46:40,148
man's got 100 million fuckin'
followers on Instagram.

1518
00:46:40,148 --> 00:46:44,557
That man's still humble as
shit ready to put in work.

1519
00:46:44,557 --> 00:46:48,441
And he's there and you got kids
that recorded one song once

1520
00:46:48,441 --> 00:46:50,720
in a studio once and think they're fancy.

1521
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,637
It's crazy.

1522
00:46:52,982 --> 00:46:54,325
- That's the difference though.

1523
00:46:54,325 --> 00:46:56,556
- Some people fake it,
some people live it.

1524
00:46:56,556 --> 00:46:58,790
- Everybody wants something
different from the game too.

1525
00:46:58,790 --> 00:46:59,976
- Yeah, that's true.

1526
00:46:59,976 --> 00:47:02,159
- (inaudible) want everything
the game want to offer,

1527
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:03,159
clearly.

1528
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:04,170
- 100%.

1529
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:06,253
- [Boyd] Can I interject?

1530
00:47:07,189 --> 00:47:08,519
- You can do anything you want?

1531
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:10,452
- Responding to the Twitter followers

1532
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:13,275
for that amount of time
and going back and forth

1533
00:47:13,275 --> 00:47:14,277
and 18 hours,

1534
00:47:14,277 --> 00:47:18,719
how do you avoid losing those
people after you scale up

1535
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:20,017
to a million or two million?

1536
00:47:20,017 --> 00:47:21,639
- Yeah, listen, everybody
wants to be that person

1537
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:23,408
that found you first
back in, like everybody,

1538
00:47:23,408 --> 00:47:27,094
people like when somebody makes
it, they love, you sold out,

1539
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,094
this and that.

1540
00:47:28,094 --> 00:47:30,838
Truth is, if you're true,
if you're intent's true,

1541
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:32,666
if you actually give a
fuck about people and fans,

1542
00:47:32,666 --> 00:47:34,065
you'll always win that macro game.

1543
00:47:34,065 --> 00:47:36,113
You're always gonna have that small group

1544
00:47:36,113 --> 00:47:38,170
that they get a high on
discovering the next thing.

1545
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:41,179
They love being that person,
right, in their group?

1546
00:47:41,179 --> 00:47:45,265
- And I think that the original
ones that you responded to

1547
00:47:45,265 --> 00:47:47,846
gonna be so engaged that
they gonna be evangelists.

1548
00:47:47,846 --> 00:47:51,244
They gonna go out and
campaign and create others --

1549
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:54,282
- And to his, and to
your point and his point,

1550
00:47:54,282 --> 00:47:55,470
and two out of 10 of 'em won't.

1551
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:56,968
Eight out of 10 will which is better

1552
00:47:56,968 --> 00:47:58,745
than zero outta 10
'cause you didn't engage

1553
00:47:58,745 --> 00:47:59,930
and the other two?

1554
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:01,605
They gotta find the
next flavor of the month
