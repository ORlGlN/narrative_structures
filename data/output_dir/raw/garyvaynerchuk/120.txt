1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
Well here we are.

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:01,666
What is this?

3
00:00:01,666 --> 00:00:02,499
What are we about to do?

4
00:00:02,499 --> 00:00:03,332
What are we jumping into?

5
00:00:03,332 --> 00:00:04,212
We're jumping into my,

6
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:05,749
release, my sneaker foot action.

7
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:07,376
The line is pretty long.

8
00:00:07,376 --> 00:00:09,959
(upbeat music)

9
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,167
We are here with Gary V, in his offices.

10
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:18,180
Thank you so much for taking the time

11
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,667
to sit down and chat with us today.

12
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:20,625
- [Gary] Thanks for havin' me.

13
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:21,458
Yeah, absolutely.

14
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:22,813
What is it about K-Swiss

15
00:00:22,813 --> 00:00:25,634
that you decided they
are the one to go with?

16
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:26,467
I didn't.

17
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:28,132
They came to me.
Got it.

18
00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:29,459
A lot of people come to me.

19
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:31,082
And I say no a lot

20
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:32,769
because this scares me.

21
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:33,602
This moment.

22
00:00:33,602 --> 00:00:35,113
Because you gotta be
able to answer to them.

23
00:00:35,113 --> 00:00:36,486
Right?

24
00:00:36,486 --> 00:00:37,866
Wearing them on the first day

25
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:38,699
of fifth or sixth grade,

26
00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:39,532
I'm still trying to remember.

27
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:40,365
I asked me mom,

28
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:41,563
we never took pictures
as Russian immigrants.

29
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:43,897
So I don't really remember.

30
00:00:43,897 --> 00:00:45,412
So the fact that I wore 'em.

31
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,124
The fact that, you know,

32
00:00:47,124 --> 00:00:48,445
I grew up in the 80's

33
00:00:48,445 --> 00:00:50,021
when ice T,

34
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:50,936
or you know,

35
00:00:50,936 --> 00:00:53,267
or Dre or other people actually wore them.

36
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:55,403
And this entire thing,

37
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:57,306
the whole thing that I'm up to

38
00:00:57,306 --> 00:01:01,473
is to build an empire of
marketing and communication

39
00:01:02,451 --> 00:01:05,308
to buy nostalgic brands and flip them.

40
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:08,480
So for me this was something
I was passionate about,

41
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,361
I felt like I could tell the story

42
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,440
'cause I've rocked 'em in the past.

43
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,685
And it's like nostalgic.

44
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:14,572
It's not Adidas, or
Under Aromour, or Nike,

45
00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:16,507
which is even more interesting to me

46
00:01:16,507 --> 00:01:17,844
because I want the nar--

47
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,469
You know, waking up this morning,

48
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:22,115
last night the site's crashing
over and over and over

49
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:26,312
you know, whether it wins
or loses in the macro,

50
00:01:26,312 --> 00:01:27,429
in the micro,

51
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:28,844
you know, looking at Twitter this morning

52
00:01:28,844 --> 00:01:31,324
and people saying ridiculous things like,

53
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:32,227
what Yeezy,

54
00:01:32,227 --> 00:01:34,243
what Kanye did for Adidas,

55
00:01:34,243 --> 00:01:35,076
Gary's doing for K-Swiss,

56
00:01:35,076 --> 00:01:35,909
that's ludacris.

57
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,259
I'm not gonna be able to pull that off.

58
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,801
I'm not on that level.

59
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:39,650
But, even though,

60
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:44,168
a little micro version
is executing my thesis.

61
00:01:44,168 --> 00:01:45,001
- [Interviewer] Sure.

62
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:47,200
Which is giving me
confidence and training,

63
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,033
- [Interviewer] Right.

64
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:50,895
For my longterm vision.

65
00:01:50,895 --> 00:01:51,728
That's why.

66
00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:53,978
The fact that I, me, me me,

67
00:01:55,084 --> 00:01:57,469
at 17 would be in line
right now at Foot Action,

68
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:58,633
like a bunch of people are

69
00:01:58,633 --> 00:01:59,840
to get this sneaker.

70
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,359
Not 'cause I love Gary V,

71
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,771
but because I saw the opportunity to make

72
00:02:02,771 --> 00:02:04,153
a hundred dollars on a flip,

73
00:02:04,153 --> 00:02:08,288
that is a big deal for
me in this whole thing.

74
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:09,989
I walked into ComplexCon
and in two seconds

75
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:10,822
I looked at Tyler I'm like,

76
00:02:10,822 --> 00:02:11,948
that's a baseball card show.

77
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:12,781
- [ Interviewer] Yeah.

78
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:14,590
I did not feel that in twenty years.

79
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,603
Right, yeah.

80
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:17,186
I mean there's such

81
00:02:18,358 --> 00:02:20,418
a parallel between what you did with wine

82
00:02:20,418 --> 00:02:22,588
and what kids are doing with shoes.

83
00:02:22,588 --> 00:02:23,421
- [Gary] A hundred percent.

84
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:25,891
I mean, they flip shoes
and they build businesses

85
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:26,724
on top of that.

86
00:02:26,724 --> 00:02:27,557
- [Garv] A hundred percent.

87
00:02:27,557 --> 00:02:28,390
It's exactly the same thing.

88
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,817
- [Gary] I pretty much know

89
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,402
that 10 of my business partners

90
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,610
where, I'll be an invest--

91
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,082
Not my deepest business partner,

92
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:36,146
I'll be an investor,

93
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:38,574
they'll be a partner, or equity owner,

94
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:39,908
in something I'm doing.

95
00:02:39,908 --> 00:02:42,163
Literally right now are sixteen year olds

96
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:43,673
flipping supreme backpacks.

97
00:02:43,673 --> 00:02:45,434
A hundred percent.

98
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:46,775
'Cause that's who I gravitate towards.

99
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:47,608
- [Interviewer] Absolutely.

100
00:02:47,608 --> 00:02:50,232
Not Harvard, you know, CFO's.

101
00:02:50,232 --> 00:02:51,225
- [Interviewer] It's a way of seeing.

102
00:02:51,225 --> 00:02:52,058
It's a way of seeing.

103
00:02:52,058 --> 00:02:53,733
That's a great way to say it.

104
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:57,282
I think we have to go to your event.

105
00:02:57,282 --> 00:02:58,115
- [Gary] Okay.

106
00:02:58,115 --> 00:02:59,254
- [Both] Let's go.

107
00:02:59,254 --> 00:03:01,671
(jazz music)

108
00:03:05,513 --> 00:03:06,751
Put in those three extra hours.

109
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:08,589
You know, put in all
the extra that you can,

110
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:10,399
but then also take care of yourself.

111
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,847
Yes.

112
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:14,433
Where do we take care of ourselves

113
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:15,736
and how do we take care of ourselves

114
00:03:15,736 --> 00:03:19,547
in a way that doesn't undercut the work?

115
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:20,380
I think, you know,

116
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,961
this is where self-awareness
is everything.

117
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:23,003
You know, like,

118
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:25,912
not everybody wants to make
a million dollars a year.

119
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:28,931
Not everybody wants cameras
on them all the time.

120
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:30,812
I think that's a very personal question.

121
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:31,645
You know,

122
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,662
I would say that for me,

123
00:03:33,662 --> 00:03:35,618
I don't make decisions or live my life

124
00:03:35,618 --> 00:03:37,625
on anybody else's wants or needs.

125
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,458
I do them on mine,

126
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,581
which means I work a lot

127
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:40,687
and I do all that stuff.

128
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,105
I don't think I'm,

129
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:42,938
or anybody else,

130
00:03:42,938 --> 00:03:44,648
is in a position to give that advice.

131
00:03:44,648 --> 00:03:46,123
Even to people I know, like Justin.

132
00:03:46,123 --> 00:03:47,630
Let alone all the people
watching right now.

133
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,463
- [Interviewer] Yeah.

134
00:03:48,463 --> 00:03:50,373
Here's what I would say.

135
00:03:50,373 --> 00:03:51,683
There's a lot of people I know

136
00:03:51,683 --> 00:03:54,511
who make $200,000 a year in their business

137
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:56,094
and then go to 275,

138
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:59,664
and at 200 they were the happiest ever.

139
00:03:59,664 --> 00:04:00,497
- [Interviewer] Right.

140
00:04:00,497 --> 00:04:03,147
And at 275 the business
got bigger in a way

141
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:04,583
that fucked them up.

142
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,148
And so for 75 thousand dollars

143
00:04:06,148 --> 00:04:06,981
off of 200--
It screwed up

144
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:07,814
their whole life.

145
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:08,647
That's right.

146
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:09,480
Or the reverse.

147
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,313
There's a lot of people watching right now

148
00:04:10,313 --> 00:04:11,649
making 87 thousand dollars a year

149
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:12,627
hating life,

150
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,579
but could make 77 thousand a year

151
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:15,687
loving life.

152
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:16,519
- [Interviewer] Right.

153
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,881
And just need to live in a one bedroom,

154
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,204
or rent a studio instead of a one.

155
00:04:20,204 --> 00:04:22,960
Like there's so many ways to do it.

156
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,786
Are you just fuckin'
fired up when you wake up,

157
00:04:25,786 --> 00:04:27,036
and if you're not,

158
00:04:27,036 --> 00:04:28,128
hack.

159
00:04:28,128 --> 00:04:29,545
And so, to me,

160
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:31,762
there's a lot of people
who want a lot more

161
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:35,196
and don't want to spend it
on Surpremes, or Nike's,

162
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:37,311
or you know, Adidas

163
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:38,144
and just,

164
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,509
you know, whatever it may be.

165
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:41,817
It's not about buying a BMW
because they're insecure.

166
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:42,650
I mean,

167
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,153
I think sneakers hide insecurity.

168
00:04:45,153 --> 00:04:46,084
(laughing)

169
00:04:46,084 --> 00:04:46,917
Yeah.

170
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:47,832
I mean, like, I don't know anybody

171
00:04:47,832 --> 00:04:51,200
who's a sneer collector
who wasn't a total dork

172
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,286
when they were growing up

173
00:04:52,286 --> 00:04:53,623
and wasn't like picked on.

174
00:04:53,623 --> 00:04:54,456
Like it's all--
I get it.

175
00:04:54,456 --> 00:04:55,926
compensation.
The real ones.

176
00:04:55,926 --> 00:04:56,759
The real ones.

177
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,592
- [Interviewer] I mean

178
00:04:57,592 --> 00:04:58,425
Now you're cool.

179
00:04:58,425 --> 00:04:59,258
- [Interviewer] Right right right.

180
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:00,091
Like now it's cool.

181
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,172
Well that's why.
Of course

182
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:02,005
it's always the same game.
It's one

183
00:05:02,005 --> 00:05:05,414
of the only cultures
where you can buy status.

184
00:05:05,414 --> 00:05:07,689
You can literally put down 400 dollars

185
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:09,539
and everybody thinks you're cool.

186
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:10,767
Let me tell you another place.

187
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:13,011
New York City night life.

188
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:13,844
Sure, coddle service.

189
00:05:13,844 --> 00:05:14,677
Yeah that's it.

190
00:05:14,677 --> 00:05:15,601
Everything, listen.

191
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:16,947
It's all economics.

192
00:05:16,947 --> 00:05:17,988
It's always that.

193
00:05:17,988 --> 00:05:19,124
Well here we are, what is this?

194
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:20,027
What are we about to do?

195
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:20,860
What are we jumping into?

196
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,110
We're jumping into my,

197
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,211
releasing my sneaker at Foot Action.

198
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:25,268
The line is really long.

199
00:05:25,268 --> 00:05:27,162
The best advantage ever
is to come from nothing.

200
00:05:27,162 --> 00:05:28,992
'Cause when you come from little,

201
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:29,825
you're fuckin'

202
00:05:29,825 --> 00:05:30,965
you're just thankful for everything.

203
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:31,798
You know?

204
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:33,999
Even the losses.

205
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:34,832
- [Interviewer] Right.

206
00:05:34,832 --> 00:05:35,665
Cause you've been there.

207
00:05:35,665 --> 00:05:36,498
You're not scared of it.

208
00:05:36,498 --> 00:05:37,331
Cause you can start, right?
Right, right,

209
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:38,164
right, right.
You didn't start

210
00:05:38,164 --> 00:05:38,997
with a trophy.

211
00:05:38,997 --> 00:05:39,830

your content, everything
you do for us, man.

225
00:05:58,528 --> 00:05:59,361
Thank you, brother.

226
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:00,194
I listen to you every morning.

227
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,217
Keep grinding man.
Thank you.

228
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:02,561
First you gotta build an audience.

229
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:04,765
And the way you do that
is by putting out content

230
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:05,724
and engaging with people.

231
00:06:05,724 --> 00:06:07,089
Goin into people's comments.

232
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:08,585
Like, pick something
you're passionate about,

233
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:09,439
put out content about it,

234
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,416
become part of the community,

235
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,014
close your eyes for five years,

236
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:13,425
and then wake up at 26

237
00:06:13,425 --> 00:06:14,999
and start thinkin' about making money.

238
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,877
That's hard advice, but that's
the real fuckin' answer.

239
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,917
Go to Instagram,

240
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:22,385
search the companies and
people that you wanna get to,

241
00:06:22,385 --> 00:06:25,918
direct message them and tell
them you'll work for free.

242
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,201
And ask 200 people.

243
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:28,534
And somebody will say yes.

244
00:06:28,534 --> 00:06:29,595
Keep grindin' baby.

245
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:32,144
Bro, I'm living in my
storage shed right now.

246
00:06:32,144 --> 00:06:33,227
That's what's up.

247
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,530
It's the patient game right now.

248
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,363
It's the shit and grim.

249
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:36,196
I love it.
I love it man.

250
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,029
I love it every morning.
Me too.

251
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,862
Five in the morning,

252
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:38,820
9:00 p.m, don't matter.
Me too.

253
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,736
I'm just doin' it,

254
00:06:39,736 --> 00:06:40,569
because of you.

255
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:41,402
Thank you so much.
Proud of you, man.

256
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,120
Thank you so much.

257
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,953
I love you, so much,

258
00:06:43,953 --> 00:06:44,786
you changed my life.
I love you back.

259
00:06:44,786 --> 00:06:45,697
Thank you so much.

260
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,906
Thank you (mumbles) I love you so much.

261
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:49,364
Insanely (mumbles).

262
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:50,697
Wow.

263
00:06:50,697 --> 00:06:51,905
- [Man] Yo.

264
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:52,822
- [Man] Yo.

265
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:54,877
I love you guys.

266
00:06:54,877 --> 00:06:55,710
I love you too.

267
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,099
How are you?
Good.

268
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:00,183
You ever see my sneakers in a store?

269
00:07:00,183 --> 00:07:01,276
This is ridiculous.

270
00:07:01,276 --> 00:07:04,219
Tell somebody how to swim
and jump into the pool.

271
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:06,390
You just keep fucking
encouraging them until they go.

272
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,223
Yeah.

273
00:07:07,223 --> 00:07:08,056
That's what my content is.

274
00:07:08,056 --> 00:07:08,889
A hundred percent.

275
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:09,722
I just need you to fuckin' do something

276
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:10,811
that doesn't feel comfortable.

277
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:11,747
Patience.
I know.

278
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:12,580
The biggest thing

279
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,575
right now,
I'm 31 now, man.

280
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:14,408
And that's young.

281
00:07:14,408 --> 00:07:15,241
I know.

282
00:07:15,241 --> 00:07:16,824
The biggest vulnerability you got left

283
00:07:16,824 --> 00:07:18,106
is thinking it's not young.

284
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:18,939
I know.

285
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:19,821
That's the only thing.

286
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:20,654
Right.

287
00:07:20,654 --> 00:07:21,487
Just promise me that.

288
00:07:21,487 --> 00:07:22,374
That's the biggest thing I feel from you,

289
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:23,540
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

290
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,691
Just fuckin'--
Thanks, man.

291
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:25,749
Have that patience and you'll win.

292
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:26,645
Yeah.

293
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:27,786
Hard core.
Yeah.

294
00:07:27,786 --> 00:07:29,419
Like every day hustlin'.
Yeah.

295
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:30,846
But macro patience.

296
00:07:30,846 --> 00:07:31,679
A hundred percent.

297
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:32,634
I'm eleven years older than you.

298
00:07:32,634 --> 00:07:33,467
Hundred percent.

299
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:35,469
So it's a long fuckin' game.

300
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:36,302
Yeah.

301
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:37,363
It is and I realize that.

302
00:07:37,363 --> 00:07:38,196
Video, I know.

303
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:39,484
You give you get.

304
00:07:39,484 --> 00:07:41,317
And when you give without expectation.

305
00:07:41,317 --> 00:07:42,179
Yeah I do.
Like, I don't

306
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:43,448
expect anybody to be here.

307
00:07:43,448 --> 00:07:44,281
Right.

308
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:45,356
I mean it, I mean it.

309
00:07:45,356 --> 00:07:46,359
Like if nobody showed up,

310
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:47,702
then that's just what it was, right?

311
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:49,017
Right.
Like, didn't give enough.

312
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:51,073
Right.
That was the game, you know?

313
00:07:51,073 --> 00:07:52,119
You took responsibility for that

314
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:53,570
and not that you was like.

315
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,436
A hundred percent man.

316
00:07:54,436 --> 00:07:56,684
You get to that place and
the shit gets much more fun.

317
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,517
No shit.

318
00:07:57,517 --> 00:07:58,350
Then you're fully bought

319
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,389
and then you've got nothing to lose.

320
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:00,800
It's always the human heart

321
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,871
that is the variable advantage.

322
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:06,515
Cause the technology
always gets commoditized.

323
00:08:06,515 --> 00:08:07,348
Thank you.

324
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:09,577
You're welcome.

325
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:10,410
So cute.

326
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:12,428
He's out like a light.

327
00:08:12,428 --> 00:08:13,261
He's been like this --
How are you?

328
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:14,094
all the time.

329
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:14,927
I'm doing very well, how are you doing?

330
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:15,760
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

331
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,087

00:08:59,031 --> 00:08:59,864
Gratitude.

368
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:00,697
Gratitude, baby.

369
00:09:00,697 --> 00:09:01,917
Like what's the alternative right?

370
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:02,750
Right, right, right.

371
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,418
You're younger than you think.

372
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:06,831
Get in here, Justin.

373
00:09:06,831 --> 00:09:09,327
If you're fuckin' 56,
you're fucking young.

374
00:09:09,327 --> 00:09:10,160
You're gonna live
Without question.

375
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,098
for another 40 fuckin' years.

376
00:09:11,098 --> 00:09:11,959
What are you doin' here?

377
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:14,484
I have this idea that I'm 44 to 100.

378
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:16,217
So every year I go 43 to 100,

379
00:09:16,217 --> 00:09:17,377
42 to 100.
He's right.

380
00:09:17,377 --> 00:09:18,227
Please wake up.

381
00:09:18,227 --> 00:09:19,944
This is not just for these little kids.

382
00:09:19,944 --> 00:09:20,777
Right.

383
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:22,333
If you're 56, you've
got 40 years to grind.

384
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,166
Appreciate it.

385
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:23,999
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.

386
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:24,982
You take care.
Take care.

387
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:25,815
Stay well.
Stay safe.

388
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,648
Thank you.

389
00:09:26,648 --> 00:09:27,486
Repetition, repetition.
Repetition.

390
00:09:27,486 --> 00:09:28,792
Like, you know how you've kinda started

391
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:30,775
to think a little differently
just by watching my stuff?

392
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:31,608
Yeah, yeah.

393
00:09:31,608 --> 00:09:33,192
Well I'm in my fuckin' head 24/7.

394
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:34,288
(laughs) True that.

395
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:36,775
So if you guys are slightly moving

396
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:38,119
because you're hearing shit,

397
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,463
imagine what's happening with me.

398
00:09:39,463 --> 00:09:41,576
Baylor nation!

399
00:09:41,576 --> 00:09:42,488
Stand up.

400
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:43,750
Stand up!

401
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,116
No excuses!

402
00:09:45,116 --> 00:09:46,199
Got it.

403
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:47,032
Pleasure to meet you, man.

404
00:09:47,032 --> 00:09:47,865
Lookin' sharp man.

405
00:09:47,865 --> 00:09:48,895
Thank you, thank you.

406
00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:49,728
I appreciate it.

407
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:50,561
Yeah.

408
00:09:50,561 --> 00:09:52,654
- [Woman] One, two, three, got it.

409
00:09:52,654 --> 00:09:54,184
Blog, when I put up the five,

410
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:56,517
don't shake my fuckin' hand.

411
00:09:59,386 --> 00:10:01,593
- [Woman] One, two, three

412
00:10:01,593 --> 00:10:02,796
Got it.

413
00:10:02,796 --> 00:10:03,629
You can go work for somebody

414
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:05,042
that you want to be as close to,

415
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:06,553
the center of the sun.

416
00:10:06,553 --> 00:10:07,825
And fuckin' work at McDonald's at night.

417
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:08,658
I don't give a fuck.

418
00:10:08,658 --> 00:10:09,538
Go humble as fuck,

419
00:10:09,538 --> 00:10:10,703
live at home, live with 30.

420
00:10:10,703 --> 00:10:11,778
I'm bussin tables right
now, it's standard.

421
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,386
That's it man, so that's it, man.

422
00:10:13,386 --> 00:10:14,354
You fuckin' know.
I understand patience.

423
00:10:14,354 --> 00:10:15,573
Clearly.

424
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,234
But now, now if you

425
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:18,552
that's the hard part.

426
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:20,406
Now do the easy part.

427
00:10:20,406 --> 00:10:22,871
Make a list of 400 producers
that you wanna fuck with,

428
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:23,796
DM them, be like,

429
00:10:23,796 --> 00:10:25,941
I'll work for fuckin'
free and grind it out.

430
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:26,774
Yeah.

431
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:28,950
One of them is gonna say yes.

432
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,572
Losing is better than winning.

433
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:32,586
I'm being dead fuckin' serious

434
00:10:32,586 --> 00:10:34,666
and the second you figure it out,

435
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,611
then you'll start winnin'.

436
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:36,444
Yes.

437
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:37,487
Thank you.

438
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:38,320
The only thing you're scared of

439
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,335
is other people's opinions.

440
00:10:39,335 --> 00:10:40,168
Facts.

441
00:10:40,168 --> 00:10:41,292
Fuck them.
That's so true.

442
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:42,125
Man bro.

443
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:42,987
Thank you, brother.

444
00:10:42,987 --> 00:10:44,552
You mean a lot to me, bro.

445
00:10:44,552 --> 00:10:45,385
That means a lot to me.

446
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:47,533
Bro, I've been following you
since I was in Columbia bro.

447
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:48,739
I appreciate it, man.

448
00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:50,442
Bro, you're my wake up call, bro.

449
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:51,275
Thank you, brother.

450
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,469
My grandparents just passed away last year

451
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:55,594
the last thing he left me was his house.

452
00:10:55,594 --> 00:10:57,364
That's my first fuckin' passive income.

453
00:10:57,364 --> 00:10:58,197
I get it.

454
00:10:58,197 --> 00:10:59,030
I live in Colombia.

455
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,599
I'm working a part time job right now.

456
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:01,432
Yeah.

457
00:11:01,432 --> 00:11:02,593
I'm looking for an eight hour shift,

458
00:11:02,593 --> 00:11:03,716
just grind, grind, grind,

459
00:11:03,716 --> 00:11:04,857
invest in Colombia.

460
00:11:04,857 --> 00:11:06,464
A down-payment over here
is 30 thousand dollars.

461
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:07,297
With 30 thousand dollars,

462
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:09,637
I could by two fuckin' houses in Columbia.

463
00:11:09,637 --> 00:11:11,330
That's right.
(mumbles)

464
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,730
Been watching you for
like a year and a half.

465
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,638
Thank you brother.
I just want you to know,

466
00:11:14,638 --> 00:11:15,471
I know I'm gonna die

467
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:16,989
and I'm doing literally everything I can

468
00:11:16,989 --> 00:11:18,014
to make that mean something.

469
00:11:18,014 --> 00:11:22,962
(everyone laughing and
singing happy birthday)

470
00:11:22,962 --> 00:11:24,712
Ah, that's amazing.

471
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:27,869
What you don't sing?

472
00:11:27,869 --> 00:11:29,820
♪ Happy birthday dear Gary ♪

473
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,737
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

474
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:35,804
Thank you.

475
00:11:35,804 --> 00:11:37,285
(applause)

476
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:39,118
I see what you've got.

477
00:11:41,372 --> 00:11:42,583
- [Man] I didn't know
they were tricking you.

478
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,241
I know what they did.

479
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:45,332
Fuck it, get outta here.

480
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:46,165
Are you good?

481
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:47,048
I'm always good.

482
00:11:47,048 --> 00:11:47,881
That's great.

483
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:48,714
It's your birthday today.

484
00:11:48,714 --> 00:11:49,749
Happy birthday, sir.
Thank you, brother.

485
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:50,582
I would like to ask,

486
00:11:50,582 --> 00:11:51,415
from a rapper,

487
00:11:51,415 --> 00:11:52,582
your top five rappers of all time.

488
00:11:52,582 --> 00:11:53,832
Biggy, Weezy,

489
00:11:55,274 --> 00:11:56,642
Bone Thugs,

490
00:11:56,642 --> 00:11:58,725
Don't sleep on Cleveland,

491
00:12:00,123 --> 00:12:00,956
then it gets a little

492
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:03,431
(mumbles) One for me, and Too Short.

493
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,367
Too fuckin short.

494
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:05,200
I'm old.

495
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,539
I'm old, I'm old, I'm old!

496
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:07,372
See you guys.

497
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:08,205
See you later.

498
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:12,576
(people shouting happy birthday)

499
00:12:12,576 --> 00:12:14,030
You wanna talk about a real

500
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,951
full circle moment in my life?

501
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:19,463
Seeing my sneakers being sold
secondary on eBay right now

502
00:12:19,463 --> 00:12:20,296
on a flip.

503
00:12:20,296 --> 00:12:22,042
Is about as fuckin',

504
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:22,875
is AJ around?

505
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,685
He left right?

506
00:12:24,685 --> 00:12:25,928
How you doin, lookin' good man.

507
00:12:25,928 --> 00:12:26,761
That was a solid handshake.

508
00:12:26,761 --> 00:12:27,969
That was!

509
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:29,057
That was legit!

510
00:12:29,057 --> 00:12:30,391
That's a good indication
of where this is goin'!

511
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:31,485
That was pretty good,
that was really good.

512
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,601
Hey everybody this is Gary Vaynerchuck

513
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:37,518
and this is episode 272
of the Ask Gary V Show.

514
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,731
Actually, that little ooh in there

515
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:41,459
is exactly how I dreamt it up.

516
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,794
T-Pain is in the house
let's hear it up for him.

517
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:44,857
Yeah!

518
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:45,690
No, no.

519
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,523
You need to be a lot louder.

520
00:12:46,523 --> 00:12:48,384
(Cheering)

521
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:49,296
That was forced.

522
00:12:49,296 --> 00:12:50,129
It was forced.

523
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:51,125
It was forced!

524
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,113
We basically got,

525
00:12:52,113 --> 00:12:54,197
basically Justin was like yeah

526
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:55,366
and everybody else was in a coma.

527
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:57,216
Baylor Nation on Facebook

528
00:12:57,216 --> 00:12:58,325
Put in your phone number,

529
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:00,413
you get an opportunity to now call

530
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:01,586
and ask some questions,

531
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:05,383
of a hiphop pioneer in
lot of ways in my opinion.

532
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:06,326
And we'll get into that in a minute.

533
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:10,206
T-Pain, for the seventy people
who are watching right now,

534
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,078
that don't know who you are,

535
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:14,166
give me a little bit your origin story.

536
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,955
You know, tell it as T-Pain, T-Pain.

537
00:13:16,955 --> 00:13:19,205
I hail from Tallahassee, Florida.

538
00:13:19,205 --> 00:13:22,455
I came up pretty much
with my mom, did my thing.

539
00:13:22,455 --> 00:13:24,303
And I got noticed by Akon.

540
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,092
Akon saw me.

541
00:13:26,092 --> 00:13:27,148
- [Gary] What year was that?

542
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:29,571
This was 2005.
Okay.

543
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:30,567
Akon saw me in 2005,

544
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:32,926
in the same year he
took me to Jive Records.

545
00:13:32,926 --> 00:13:34,181
Got me signed to Jive Records.

546
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:38,173
Which Jive Records is now RCA Records.

547
00:13:38,173 --> 00:13:39,424
It's a lot happenin' in between that.

548
00:13:39,424 --> 00:13:41,096
Obviously I skipped a bunch but,

549
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:44,189
you know, I'm super awesome.

550
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:45,088
(laughing)

551
00:13:45,088 --> 00:13:46,291
That's a really good

552
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,533
way to put it.
Sums it up!

553
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:48,958
Do you like being in the studio more

554
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,078
or do you like to perform more?

555
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,281
Aw man, that's hard to say.

556
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:54,521
Is it a 50, 50 thing for you?

557
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:56,332
It's a 50, 50 thing for me
because if I'm in the studio

558
00:13:56,332 --> 00:13:58,233
with somebody, it's
basically me performin'

559
00:13:58,233 --> 00:13:59,066
for that person.

560
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:00,600
Right, 'cause right now, this many people,

561
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,168
in the same way it does for me,

562
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:03,406
I can see it in you.

563
00:14:03,406 --> 00:14:04,902
If there was two people in here,

564
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:07,818
you'd be at certain level.

565
00:14:07,818 --> 00:14:09,581
But do you get compoundly higher?

566
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:10,727
Like I only need one.

567
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:13,245
But if there is four,
I get a little crazier.

568
00:14:13,245 --> 00:14:15,164
This has me goin' a little bit.

569
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:18,110
You give me 40,000 and I
get fuckin' outta my mind.

570
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,230
Two people in here, I'll shut down.

571
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,087
I got crazy social anxiety.

572
00:14:22,087 --> 00:14:22,920
I see.

573
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,700
So when do you go from shutdown to on?

574
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,534
Seven?

575
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:28,027
49?

576
00:14:28,027 --> 00:14:29,947
If I'm performin' on stage.

577
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:31,047
If there's 100 people in there,

578
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:32,184
I don't--
You're good?

579
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:33,240
I don't know what to do.

580
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,593
- [Gary] Oh you don't?

581
00:14:34,593 --> 00:14:36,062
Mhm, right.

582
00:14:36,062 --> 00:14:36,895
(laughing)

583
00:14:36,895 --> 00:14:37,728
And I'm like.

584
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:38,561
Give me, give me, give me,

585
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:39,394
give me.
Give me 73,000.

586
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:40,227
Give me alcohol.

587
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:41,077
Give me alcohol.

588
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:42,592
So when do you turn on?

589
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:44,342
1,000, 4,000, 90,000?

590
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,352
300.

591
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,908
300?
300.

592
00:14:47,908 --> 00:14:50,756
So if we throw a show with 299 of my fans

593
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,972
in a show, shutdown.

594
00:14:51,972 --> 00:14:52,889
301, crunk.

595
00:14:54,336 --> 00:14:55,351
Out of control.

596
00:14:55,351 --> 00:14:58,082
(laughing)

597
00:14:58,082 --> 00:14:59,317
Outta control.

598
00:14:59,317 --> 00:15:00,150
Let's get a call in.

599
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,703
You guys T-Pain's in the building.

600
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:03,784
Facebook, put your numbers
and he's gonna get you goin.

601
00:15:03,784 --> 00:15:05,856
We are unlocking secrets.

602
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:07,570
The magic number for T-Pain

603
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,083
is 300.
300.

604
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,764
300 is when he turns it.

605
00:15:10,764 --> 00:15:12,272
T-Pain thank you so much for the fun.

606
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:13,320
Absolutely.
Thanks for sharing

607
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,305
the struggle, which I think.

608
00:15:16,305 --> 00:15:19,173
If it helped one person in this hour.

609
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:20,952
Then we won here.
That's a miracle.

610
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:22,083
And I wish you nothing but the best.

611
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,252
Good health and all that.
I thank you.

612
00:15:23,252 --> 00:15:24,209
Thank you.
Thanks for bein' on.

613
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:25,400
I'm probably gonna take--
Steal something.

614
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,996
See ya'.
(laughing)

615
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:31,271
On this episode, T-Pain stops by!

616
00:15:31,271 --> 00:15:34,267
When I was listening to Sabir,
the book, my investments,

617
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,765
my career is win-win.

618
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:37,589
Planet of the Apps.

619
00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:39,242
If it works, right.

620
00:15:39,242 --> 00:15:40,967
I'm a household name.

621
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:42,429
If it doesn't work,

622
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:44,285
when Apple figures out it's shit,

623
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:45,851
I will always say that I was on Apple's

624
00:15:45,851 --> 00:15:47,205
first original show.

625
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:48,300
It was win-win.

626
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,699
This sneaker was win-win.

627
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:50,898
If it rocked,

628
00:15:50,898 --> 00:15:52,450
like it looks like it's about to,

629
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,871
well fuck, I'm the first entrepreneur

630
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,576
to have a sneaker that matters in culture.

631
00:15:55,576 --> 00:15:57,153
Other entrepreneurs are gonna get sneakers

632
00:15:57,153 --> 00:15:58,972
and it's a legacy that can
get really interesting,

633
00:15:58,972 --> 00:16:00,268
especially if you think about footwear,

634
00:16:00,268 --> 00:16:01,548
in a corporate environments,

635
00:16:01,548 --> 00:16:02,780
you start thinkin' about four, seven,

636
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,120
nine years from now.

637
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,549
If it lost, it was such ridiculous ammo

638
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,513
for my best friends to make fun of me.

639
00:16:08,513 --> 00:16:09,346
(laughing)

640
00:16:09,346 --> 00:16:11,156
That I thought that I could
actually pull off a sneaker.

641
00:16:11,156 --> 00:16:13,206
And what the fuck were you thinking.

642
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,373
So, I'm a big win-win guy.

643
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,057
It's why I tend to be happy.

644
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:22,196
I don't do things that have
disproportionate downside.

645
00:16:22,196 --> 00:16:23,943
I also don't do a lot of things that have

646
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:24,830
disproportionate upside.

647
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,503
Which is why I'm a tortoise

648
00:16:26,503 --> 00:16:28,924
even though I wear a hare's costume.

649
00:16:28,924 --> 00:16:31,622
My energy seems short term.

650
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:33,154
My strategy and execution

651
00:16:33,154 --> 00:16:36,338
is about as longterm as it gets out there.

652
00:16:36,338 --> 00:16:37,671
And I like that.

653
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,048
And so, you know, look,

654
00:16:41,048 --> 00:16:43,685
I was a guy who got
into eCommerce in 1996.

655
00:16:43,685 --> 00:16:44,518
Gary, thanks so much man.

656
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:45,839
We really appreciate you comin' on.

657
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,864
You guys are awesome to work with.

658
00:16:46,864 --> 00:16:47,697
I love working--
Thank you.

659
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:48,530
Thank you.

660
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,363
Thank you.

661
00:16:49,363 --> 00:16:50,196
Thank you Gary.
Thanks (mumbles).

662
00:16:50,196 --> 00:16:51,430
Bye guys I love you, see ya'.

663
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,263
- [Man] Thank you for listening

664
00:16:52,263 --> 00:16:53,103
to Hack the Holidays podcast.

665
00:16:53,103 --> 00:16:54,311
See ya'.

666
00:16:54,311 --> 00:00:00,000
(tranquil music)
