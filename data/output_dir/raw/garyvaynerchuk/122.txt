1
00:00:00,879 --> 00:00:02,382
Man it's incredible.

2
00:00:02,382 --> 00:00:03,802
Humans are humans.

3
00:00:03,802 --> 00:00:05,581
It's incredible.

4
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:08,983
Like, fuck man I really
just wish people just wanted

5
00:00:08,983 --> 00:00:10,959
to like each other all the time.

6
00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:13,876
We could have so much fun.

7
00:00:13,876 --> 00:00:17,316
We could have so much fuckin' fun.

8
00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:18,149
Sucks.

9
00:00:22,378 --> 00:00:23,880
We could have so much fun.

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,463
(hip-hop beat)

11
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:35,060
Coming to you live from Sydney, Australia.

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,629
Yo check out Opera House.

13
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:40,930
Got that Opera House out there like what.

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,662
That iconic building.

15
00:00:42,662 --> 00:00:43,874
On my way to Melbourne right now,

16
00:00:43,874 --> 00:00:47,541
gonna rip some fuckin'
Australian faces off.

17
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,568
I've been spending a
lot of time on mindset.

18
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:54,418
I don't like mindset
'cause it feels fluffy,

19
00:00:54,418 --> 00:00:56,256
it feels a little too motivational speaker

20
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:59,161
and I don't love it but the truth is,

21
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:01,107
it fuckin' matters.

22
00:01:01,107 --> 00:01:03,462
Because the reason it matters is because

23
00:01:03,462 --> 00:01:06,918
it's the way you basically
approach everything.

24
00:01:06,918 --> 00:01:08,382
One of the biggest reasons
I think I've been able to

25
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:10,580
build good companies is
I put enormous stress

26
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,131
on leaders, managers
of mine, to understand

27
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:15,051
that they're not capable.

28
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:17,011
If they are not capable of being

29
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:19,555
the bigger woman and
man in every situation

30
00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:22,621
even if they are 100% right,

31
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:25,962
they don't have the
framework to be successful

32
00:01:25,962 --> 00:01:26,922
as a leader.

33
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:29,487
This whole process real
closely and I've just been

34
00:01:29,487 --> 00:01:32,570
really looking forward to connecting.

35
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:37,237
And if he chooses to 'cause I don't wanna

36
00:01:37,237 --> 00:01:39,356
force anybody do anything,

37
00:01:39,356 --> 00:01:42,559
the down times in his career to build

38
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:45,163
relationships and
infrastructure that lasts him

39
00:01:45,163 --> 00:01:48,830
for the 50-70 years he
lives after football.

40
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,185
- [Helena] Hey Gary, Baben, I'm Helena,

41
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:59,803
I just met you at Sydney
Airport very briefly

42
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:00,958
before you guys got on your flight

43
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:04,087
to Melbourne and I sat
on that flight so hyped

44
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:06,064
that I'd run into you guys.

45
00:02:06,064 --> 00:02:09,054
And then I got home and opened Facebook.

46
00:02:09,054 --> 00:02:11,093
And so two years ago to this day,

47
00:02:11,093 --> 00:02:14,746
was the first time I
saw any of your content

48
00:02:14,746 --> 00:02:17,629
and it just before launching my own brand

49
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:20,070
and I need to say thank you for giving me

50
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,597
the confidence and bravado
to just be like, "Fuck it."

51
00:02:23,597 --> 00:02:25,395
- [Interviewer] So you're
here for a couple of shows?

52
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,458
Just one show and off to New York after.

53
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,291
Yeah?

54
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,124
So you're in and out?

55
00:02:29,124 --> 00:02:29,957
In and out.

56
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:30,920
What do you know about Melbourne?

57
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,142
I've been here three times on business

58
00:02:32,142 --> 00:02:33,673
in the past when I grew
up in the wine world.

59
00:02:33,673 --> 00:02:34,506
Yeah?

60
00:02:34,506 --> 00:02:36,270
I know the people are fuckin' awesome.

61
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,250
(laughing)

62
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,656
And I know that there's good solid hustle.

63
00:02:39,656 --> 00:02:42,406
A negative to you is crazy to me.

64
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,714
Insecurity at its finest.

65
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:49,832
It's just so stupid.

66
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:50,824
Why would you be mad?

67
00:02:50,824 --> 00:02:52,556
You should be happy.

68
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:54,183
It should motivate you.

69
00:02:54,183 --> 00:02:56,883
I love seeing people win.

70
00:02:56,883 --> 00:02:58,575
Chris Sacca like crushing
the investment game

71
00:02:58,575 --> 00:03:01,535
like during my era makes me pumped.

72
00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:02,368
He deserves it.

73
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:03,432
He was right about the winner,

74
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:04,550
bought up all the secondary,

75
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,137
he was right about Uber, early as shit,

76
00:03:06,137 --> 00:03:07,376
he was right about Instagram.

77
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:09,837
Like why would I be upset?

78
00:03:09,837 --> 00:03:10,774
You know?

79
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:11,769
I love it.

80
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:13,448
- [Passenger] Raise the bar for all of us.

81
00:03:13,448 --> 00:03:14,281
You know what the best part is?

82
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:15,718
It's like when you get into that mindset

83
00:03:15,718 --> 00:03:17,536
when you love winning but the only thing

84
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:20,192
that you love more than winning is losing,

85
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,388
then you're fuckin' dangerous.

86
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:24,624
You're just fuckin', you've won either way

87
00:03:24,624 --> 00:03:26,011
before you've started.

88
00:03:26,011 --> 00:03:28,424
I love losing like 11 nothing in like a

89
00:03:28,424 --> 00:03:29,888
one on one game as long as I know

90
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:31,514
there's more games to be had.

91
00:03:31,514 --> 00:03:34,547
Like if AJ beats me 11 nothing
in the first of like five,

92
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,720
I'm like, "This is perfect."

93
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,715
You know?

94
00:03:36,715 --> 00:03:38,185
I don't know, I just don't get people.

95
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:41,697
I just don't, begrudging is such a

96
00:03:41,697 --> 00:03:44,185
flaw in stopping you

97
00:03:44,185 --> 00:03:46,556
from getting to where you wanna get to.

98
00:03:46,556 --> 00:03:47,650
You're putting out negative energy,

99
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,226
you're spending mind, you're
spending energy and time

100
00:03:51,226 --> 00:03:53,190
on other people that are winning

101
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,107
who are gonna win regardless
of what you think.

102
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Winners win.

103
00:04:00,427 --> 00:04:02,618
The quicker you wrap
your head around that,

104
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,635
the more you don't spend any time on them

105
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:06,802
and you move and you know?

106
00:04:08,218 --> 00:04:11,068
(laughing)

107
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:13,818
That's gonna be such a good line.

108
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:18,968
Gotta give a huge shout
out to Australian hotels.

109
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:21,135
They've been nice as fuck.

110
00:04:22,314 --> 00:04:23,916
You agree Baben?

111
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,344
You've enjoyed 'em?

112
00:04:25,344 --> 00:04:26,249
I have.

113
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:29,531
I think Zach Nadler has been a,

114
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:31,919
Zach have you brought value to the vlog?

115
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,437
Every day.

116
00:04:33,437 --> 00:04:34,604
(laughing)

117
00:04:34,604 --> 00:04:35,437
Okay.

118
00:04:35,437 --> 00:04:37,214
I'm about to completely destroy the faces

119
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:40,688
of every single person
at this Melbourne talk.

120
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:43,065
I'm just not even gonna be fuckin' around.

121
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:45,449
Like I'm gonna go 11
instead of 10 tonight.

122
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:46,816
It allows me to start this talk

123
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:49,408
with something I don't really
talk a whole lot about.

124
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:52,551
I think I once quoted it on
Instagram but other than that,

125
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:55,603
I'm fascinated by people's need

126
00:04:55,603 --> 00:04:59,164
to justify their ambitions instead of just

127
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:01,531
focusing on them themselves.

128
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:04,948
There's so much insecurity in this system

129
00:05:06,118 --> 00:05:08,535
which is what leads so
many people to be fearful

130
00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:10,337
to take the jumps that they want to do

131
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:12,250
because they're worried
about what other people

132
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,313
are gonna say about their failures

133
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:15,988
and I'm fascinated by that because

134
00:05:15,988 --> 00:05:18,788
no question my biggest
strength was the self-esteem

135
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:21,214
that my mom put inside
of me and the environment

136
00:05:21,214 --> 00:05:23,157
that I grew up with
and thick skin of being

137
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,634
an immigrant and not having much

138
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:27,301
and all the benefits that I had.

139
00:05:29,655 --> 00:05:31,681
It is some kid you went to school emailed.

140
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:32,677
What?

141
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:34,112
Abel Franco who you got in a

142
00:05:34,112 --> 00:05:35,397
fist fight with in middle school?

143
00:05:35,397 --> 00:05:36,705
Holy shit!

144
00:05:36,705 --> 00:05:38,313
Abel Franco.

145
00:05:38,313 --> 00:05:40,133
I'm reading this and I'm
like "Wait a second,"

146
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:41,877
(laughing)

147
00:05:41,877 --> 00:05:45,784
God almighty, this dude
was my super friend.

148
00:05:45,784 --> 00:05:46,867
Super friend.

149
00:05:48,288 --> 00:05:50,114
Want me to forward you that?

150
00:05:50,114 --> 00:05:50,947
Yeah forward it.

151
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:52,296
That's one of my true fuckin' friends.

152
00:05:52,296 --> 00:05:55,298
Abel Franco, this is
why the vlog's perfect,

153
00:05:55,298 --> 00:05:57,388
Abel Fuckin' Franco, the best Abel,

154
00:05:57,388 --> 00:05:58,818
what you don't remember and you remember,

155
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:00,275
first of all, it's terrible to hear

156
00:06:00,275 --> 00:06:02,042
what happened to your
mom, I remember your mom

157
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:04,940
and I'm so, so, so
sorry, that's ridiculous,

158
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,724
I'm emailing you in a little bit,

159
00:06:06,724 --> 00:06:08,607
what you don't remember
is I came over your house

160
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:11,199
for Survivor Series in sixth grade

161
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,778
and it was the fuckin' best and I remember

162
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:16,420
everything about it, you
were a tremendous WWF fan

163
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,753
and my core, me, you,

164
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:20,729
I'm trying to think of,

165
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:22,239
there was one other kid who,

166
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:25,779
oh, Regan, who died in a
car accident in high school.

167
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:28,779
I moved away as well, so did you but

168
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:33,500
I remember going to
your house and watching

169
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,167
that Survivor Series
like yesterday brother.

170
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:39,257
I'm so fuckin' pumped that you,

171
00:06:39,257 --> 00:06:42,189
you just emailed me, I
can't wait to reconnect,

172
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:45,342
you know, there's not a lot
of people I fully remember

173
00:06:45,342 --> 00:06:48,655
either from middle school,
back in the day in Edison

174
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:50,156
but you're one of them brother,

175
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:52,411
I'm so happy right now,
I can't wait to connect.

176
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,503
Is that literally you may make one,

177
00:06:54,503 --> 00:06:56,999
make sure he makes like,
whatever story tell

178
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:00,070
but if there's not force
one hundredth of a second

179
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,985
of him in it, you'll shit how many people

180
00:07:02,985 --> 00:07:04,811
will reach out to you.

181
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:05,963
You know what people don't know?

182
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:06,967
They don't get?

183
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:10,033
More people watch my vlog
than the far majority

184
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:12,235
of cable television shows.

185
00:07:12,235 --> 00:07:14,153
People don't get what's
actually happening.

186
00:07:14,153 --> 00:07:16,907
They don't understand that a cable show

187
00:07:16,907 --> 00:07:20,520
has 37,000 actual watchers of their show.

188
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,245
They don't get it.

189
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:25,972
So you're gonna make like
a one second appearance

190
00:07:25,972 --> 00:07:27,617
and like get hit up by like,

191
00:07:27,617 --> 00:07:28,537
(laughing)

192
00:07:28,537 --> 00:07:30,360
There it is, that's it, that's it.

193
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,930
I literally get emailed from like,

194
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,368
your fourth grade teacher Mrs. Thompson.

195
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:36,395
But it's really, really fascinating to me

196
00:07:36,395 --> 00:07:40,687
of how people spend their
energy and their time.

197
00:07:40,687 --> 00:07:44,410
So much of it is what I
would call defense work,

198
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,544
hedging against,
justifying, explaining why,

199
00:07:48,544 --> 00:07:51,663
reacting to the market
instead of reacting to

200
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:54,903
what's going on in their own dome.

201
00:07:54,903 --> 00:07:57,070
Third speech in Australia.

202
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:02,880
Saving the best for last.

203
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:08,785
The framework of how I attack the game

204
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:11,969
has so much more to do
with the way I feel about

205
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:14,298
my intent and how I'm going about doing it

206
00:08:14,298 --> 00:08:16,052
and all these warm and fuzzy things

207
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:18,189
that I tend to like to talk about,

208
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:20,022
they're just strength.

209
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:24,849
Humility and empathy and
gratitude and all these

210
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:27,849
warm, emotional intelligence pillars

211
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,995
are enormous strength.

212
00:08:30,995 --> 00:08:33,995
(audience cheering)

213
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:38,577
There's this huge disconnect right now

214
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:39,484
with entrepreneurship.

215
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:41,453
Let me tell what entrepreneurship is.

216
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:44,988
It's lonely, it's stressful,

217
00:08:44,988 --> 00:08:47,213
it's difficult,

218
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:49,177
it sounds great on paper until you realize

219
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:51,739
when you have employees,
you work for them,

220
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,013
not they work for you.

221
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:56,436
So many people are built on one pillar.

222
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,402
Some arbitrage, some thing,

223
00:08:58,402 --> 00:09:00,015
somebody's feeding them something

224
00:09:00,015 --> 00:09:03,191
Facebook, Google, something's working

225
00:09:03,191 --> 00:09:05,358
but it's a one punch pony.

226
00:09:06,387 --> 00:09:09,879
And if you watch fighting,
if you like UFC or Boxing,

227
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:12,990
once somebody figures
out, it's every sport,

228
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,436
you can go from highlight
to fuckin' football,

229
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:19,666
if you have one move, when
the market figures it out,

230
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:23,456
you're finished and so
many of the business

231
00:09:23,456 --> 00:09:25,899
and so many of the people
that I'm analyzing right now

232
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,296
have one move and they don't realize that

233
00:09:28,296 --> 00:09:30,620
technology's about to take away that move

234
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,721
and they literally go from
hero to zero in heartbeat.

235
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:36,307
My friends, it is time to get educated on

236
00:09:36,307 --> 00:09:38,098
what's actually happening.

237
00:09:38,098 --> 00:09:40,689
My friends, if you do not deeply, deeply,

238
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:42,692
deeply understand how to market

239
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:46,061
on Facebook and Instagram,
please run the fuck out of here

240
00:09:46,061 --> 00:09:49,388
and go to Google and
spend the next 400 hours

241
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:52,234
watching videos and
reading books and testing

242
00:09:52,234 --> 00:09:55,052
because it is absolutely
the underpriced place,

243
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,516
I don't give a fuck
about Facebook or Zucks,

244
00:09:57,516 --> 00:10:00,106
I could care less if it closed tomorrow,

245
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:02,320
I care about where you spend attention

246
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,232
and it's underpriced and
it is very crystal clear.

247
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:09,404
So please take advantage
of this incredible era

248
00:10:09,404 --> 00:10:13,058
because if you do not, somebody else will

249
00:10:13,058 --> 00:10:15,200
and that's gonna come at your detriment.

250
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,730
And the people here that
really go all in will have it

251
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,027
and the people that don't will feel it.

252
00:10:20,027 --> 00:10:22,351
And to me that's why I
wanna come with this gusto

253
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:24,960
here today because to
be very honest with you,

254
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,693
I fully expect only 95%
to do nothing about it.

255
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:32,309
95, you're pumped now, this feels good,

256
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:34,452
I'm shooting the shit out of my energy

257
00:10:34,452 --> 00:10:37,266
directly in your fucking mouth but

258
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:40,399
next Thursday's gonna
happen and you lose a client

259
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,003
or something gets fucked up
or you gotta pay some bill

260
00:10:44,003 --> 00:10:46,098
and then you don't go on the offense.

261
00:10:46,098 --> 00:10:48,687
And so I'm hoping for three or four people

262
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:51,302
to email me in two years.

263
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:53,987
I get it man and I've
heard that my whole life

264
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,032
and guess what, people
are just not executing

265
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,921
and it's so real.

266
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:00,312
You know, it's so hard to believe

267
00:11:00,312 --> 00:11:02,145
something's happening,

268
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:04,972
when you don't see it.

269
00:11:04,972 --> 00:11:06,551
When you don't feel it, when you don't see

270
00:11:06,551 --> 00:11:08,858
and feel what I feel, I
get it 'cause there's a lot

271
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:10,592
of things in the world
that I don't see and feel

272
00:11:10,592 --> 00:11:11,991
and then they happen, people are like

273
00:11:11,991 --> 00:11:13,574
I told you that plants didn't have as much

274
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:15,746
protein as they used to, I'm
like, plants have protein?

275
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:17,020
What the fuck are you talking about?

276
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,105
Like I don't know, there's
a lot of shit I don't know.

277
00:11:20,105 --> 00:11:21,594
But there's one thing I know

278
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:23,026
and I've known it my whole life.

279
00:11:23,026 --> 00:11:25,996
I know what you're gonna
do before you do it

280
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:27,516
and that's why I get to stand up here

281
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:29,382
and I'm telling you right the fuck now,

282
00:11:29,382 --> 00:11:31,577
Facebook and Instagram and Voice.

283
00:11:31,577 --> 00:11:34,204
Bet your fuckin' children's health on it.

284
00:11:34,204 --> 00:11:36,523
(laughing)

285
00:11:36,523 --> 00:11:37,540
Thank you.

286
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,171
(applause)

287
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:42,076
I'm tired which is great.

288
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,165
You just killed Australia in 36 hours.

289
00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:48,603
We did destroy, we did
fuckin' destroy Australia.

290
00:11:48,603 --> 00:11:50,270
We sliced Australia.

291
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:53,972
Good trip.

292
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:55,336
Great to see ya.

293
00:11:55,336 --> 00:11:56,263
We'll chat next week.

294
00:11:56,263 --> 00:11:57,096
Yeah.

295
00:11:57,096 --> 00:11:58,083
Thank you so much.

296
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,021
Thanks for such a, it was awesome fun,

297
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,271
it was so cool.

298
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,962
Alright guys, I know you've been

299
00:12:06,962 --> 00:12:09,536
waiting this whole Australia trip.

300
00:12:09,536 --> 00:12:11,375
I know you have Baben.

301
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,351
- [Baben] This is my first--

302
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:14,809
This is your first experience

303
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:18,220
where a normal businessman turns into

304
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,303
the world's greatest emerging superhero.

305
00:12:24,405 --> 00:12:25,488
Airport Gary.

306
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,047
Superheroes of the 21st century.

307
00:12:31,756 --> 00:12:35,506
It is officially Airport Gary.

308
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,116
(chuckling)

309
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:41,057
I love it.

310
00:12:41,057 --> 00:00:00,000
(ambient piano beat)
