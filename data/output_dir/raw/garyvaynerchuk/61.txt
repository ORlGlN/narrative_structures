1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:01,208
- Hi there.

2
00:00:01,208 --> 00:00:02,041
- Gary Vee!

3
00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:02,874
- (laughs) Hi.

4
00:00:02,874 --> 00:00:04,490
- Three wor- ah, three words

5
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,634
to give me inspiration for
any day I'm feeling down.

6
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:07,558
- Three words.

7
00:00:07,558 --> 00:00:08,472
- Three words.

8
00:00:08,472 --> 00:00:10,639
- You're gonna die.

9
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:11,547
- [Man On Phone] Um,
which other hip-hop artist

10
00:00:11,547 --> 00:00:14,508
or true entrepreneur,
like in this digital era.

11
00:00:14,508 --> 00:00:16,883
- [Woman On Phone] I think
the guy to pay attention to

12
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:19,987
is a guy by the name of CEO Charlie.

13
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:21,943
- My name is Charlie Jabaley

14
00:00:21,943 --> 00:00:25,197
and Gary has been an
amazing friend of mine

15
00:00:25,197 --> 00:00:26,447
for many years.

16
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,323
- Ahh-haa.

17
00:00:30,485 --> 00:00:32,060
Hi, how you doin' man.

18
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,130
- Good, brother, how are you?

19
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,020
- Are you feeling okay?

20
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:34,853
- I feel amazing.

21
00:00:34,853 --> 00:00:36,047
You look insane, brother.

22
00:00:36,047 --> 00:00:38,070
I mean, I see it, I see it online,

23
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,924
but to see it in person just
makes me so fuckin' happy.

24
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:43,524
Like, if you ever watch
one of those movies,

25
00:00:43,524 --> 00:00:47,691
where like, there's like a,
a wise man like a oracle,

26
00:00:49,356 --> 00:00:52,279
you know, but like he doesn't always like

27
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:55,005
make himself available, but you can like

28
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:58,326
live through his teachings,
and you feel like you know him.

29
00:00:58,326 --> 00:01:01,243
I'd always listen to
everything he would say,

30
00:01:01,243 --> 00:01:02,570
and it really sat with me.

31
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,370
There was this one thing he
said, "one day you're gonna die,

32
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,484
and you should do something about it."

33
00:01:09,484 --> 00:01:12,901
And I didn't know exactly what that meant

34
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:17,908
until I felt like I
was actually gonna die.

35
00:01:18,877 --> 00:01:22,260
I always had this one
dream of being an athlete,

36
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,238
and growin' up, like I loved basketball,

37
00:01:26,238 --> 00:01:28,479
but I was the chubby kid.

38
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,709
Playin' sports wasn't
exactly like the right fit

39
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:33,779
for me in life.

40
00:01:33,779 --> 00:01:36,029
It seemed like I was overweight

41
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,143
and I was very insecure about it,

42
00:01:38,143 --> 00:01:40,077
and when you're insecure about things,

43
00:01:40,077 --> 00:01:43,397
sometimes you mask it and you cover it up

44
00:01:43,397 --> 00:01:45,781
with something you can be good at.

45
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:47,160
You gotta have something that's you,

46
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,105
and um, I was like, I'm gonna be business.

47
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:54,241
Like, I'm CEO Charlie, like young age,

48
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:57,461
I'm CEO Charlie at that early age.

49
00:01:57,461 --> 00:01:59,595
I buried what I truly wanted to be

50
00:01:59,595 --> 00:02:01,933
and I did business and I got good at it,

51
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:06,244
and as the business grew,
you know like, I grew.

52
00:02:06,244 --> 00:02:08,661
Um, I got up over 304 pounds,

53
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:12,283
and you know with all this amazing things

54
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:16,044
that were happening in my life,
I was never as un-unhappy.

55
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:17,794
I was very depressed.

56
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,763
Look how bad I look, that's horrible.

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,836
That's horrible.

58
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:26,571
My name's Charlie Jabaley,

59
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:29,179
and I've been overweight my whole life.

60
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:33,012
My addiction to food
just, just beats me down.

61
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,393
I binge-eat until I get sick,

62
00:02:37,393 --> 00:02:41,216
and I do that so I would
never want to binge-eat again,

63
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:43,368
but it's just a downward spiral.

64
00:02:43,368 --> 00:02:46,158
I don't wanna be in a depression anymore.

65
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:49,641
Health, health is the most important thing

66
00:02:49,641 --> 00:02:53,220
to business, because
you're looking at a guy

67
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,387
who had all the business,
you know, he could ever want,

68
00:02:57,387 --> 00:03:00,232
but, um, with my health
not being in order,

69
00:03:00,232 --> 00:03:01,841
it meant nothing.

70
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:04,417
One of my best friends,
his name's Scott Cameron,

71
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:08,377
he saw something in me,
and he knew that I'd

72
00:03:08,377 --> 00:03:10,235
been dieting my whole life, and he said,

73
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:12,387
you know, we're gonna run, we're not gonna

74
00:03:12,387 --> 00:03:16,470
do diets anymore, and uh,
we ran three marathons,

75
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:20,487
and um, people don't
believe me when I say this,

76
00:03:20,487 --> 00:03:23,404
I gained weight, I gained 30 pounds

77
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:29,819
through the marathon
process, and um, it seems,

78
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,774
it seems kind of hard to believe,

79
00:03:31,774 --> 00:03:33,583
but it was one of those situations

80
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,743
where you just keep tryin',
but you keep messin' up

81
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:40,098
at the same exact time,
but you're super ambitious,

82
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:44,265
but when you mess up, it
just undoes all the ambition.

83
00:03:45,802 --> 00:03:49,670
And I felt stuck, and uh,
I was just like, ask God

84
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,462
what else do you want me to do?

85
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:54,924
You know, I'm doing everything, and uh,

86
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:57,924
ran three marathons, gained weight

87
00:03:57,924 --> 00:04:00,841
and I thought I was at rock bottom,

88
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:04,319
and then things got worse.

89
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,893
I knew something was wrong but
I didn't know what was wrong,

90
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:11,744
and one day I woke up and the
room just started spinning.

91
00:04:11,744 --> 00:04:16,322
- And this is when he was
doing the gav-in-hans-flyer,

92
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,085
there like, killin' a whole game.

93
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:19,096
- Yeah, like.

94
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:22,216
- When you're at the top
of your business game.

95
00:04:22,216 --> 00:04:26,993
- Never sad, never, wo,
wake up, room is spinning,

96
00:04:26,993 --> 00:04:29,594
I'm like, oh this isn't good.

97
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:33,573
And then I got outta bed,
went to pick up the shoes,

98
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,156
boo-, fell.
- fell.

99
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:41,167
- Went to the doctor, brain
tumor, left the ground,

100
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:44,189
left optic nerve, coronary artery,

101
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:48,356
it could start corroding
the top of my spinal cord.

102
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:55,031
At that point, it's like, when you gave me

103
00:04:57,262 --> 00:05:00,345
my secret sword to go slay my dragon.

104
00:05:01,716 --> 00:05:03,133
Like, I'm like...

105
00:05:05,325 --> 00:05:07,422
I'm-a change everything.

106
00:05:07,422 --> 00:05:09,140
This is the sum-life shit.

107
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,400
I'm-a change everything.

108
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,308
It was scary 'cause I knew something

109
00:05:12,308 --> 00:05:15,311
was really really wrong, and
I felt like I was about to die

110
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:18,722
and, uh, the brain tumor had grown,

111
00:05:18,722 --> 00:05:22,141
and it was, uh, wrapped
around my left optic nerve,

112
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:24,750
my coronary artery, and um, said it could

113
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,954
start corroding the top of my spinal cord.

114
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:32,209
The levels of, like the
hormones and everything,

115
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:33,803
that my brain tumor puts off

116
00:05:33,803 --> 00:05:37,970
were at like 10 thousand times
what they should have been.

117
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:40,160
And um,

118
00:05:41,798 --> 00:05:43,798
So, I went on a journey,

119
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,400
and that's when, that's
when that voice of Gary

120
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,705
was kinda in my head.

121
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:51,795
Like he said, one day you're gonna die,

122
00:05:51,795 --> 00:05:54,451
you know, you gotta do something about it,

123
00:05:54,451 --> 00:05:57,228
and the social pressures, um,

124
00:05:57,228 --> 00:05:58,804
were strong you know,

125
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:02,367
but I knew something
drastic had to change.

126
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:03,825
And the social pressures are,

127
00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:05,578
you're supposed to have this much money

128
00:06:05,578 --> 00:06:07,089
in your bank account, you know,

129
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:08,440
you're supposed to have nice cars,

130
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,881
you're supposed to, you
know, do all these things,

131
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:12,886
uh, that relate to business and money,

132
00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:16,386
but, at this point, none of that made any,

133
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:21,280
made any, uh, it didn't matter to me.

134
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,017
It didn't matter to me anymore, so

135
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:26,878
I just heard a voice, and it was like,

136
00:06:26,878 --> 00:06:29,211
go on a journey, and I left,

137
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,363
I left my company, I
left the city of Atlanta.

138
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:39,655
I left everything, because I wanted

139
00:06:39,655 --> 00:06:42,610
to start a whole new life, where I could

140
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,741
do it right this time.

141
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:47,864
And, um, I became the exact opposite

142
00:06:47,864 --> 00:06:51,256
of every single thing I was, and uh,

143
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:54,774
I was this workaholic, work
a hundred hour workweeks,

144
00:06:54,774 --> 00:06:57,707
and I just wasn't a happy person,

145
00:06:57,707 --> 00:07:01,102
I was depressed and anti-social,

146
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:05,411
and now, um, you know,
I've lost 125 pounds,

147
00:07:05,411 --> 00:07:09,964
I'm training for a IRONMAN
in March, in New Zealand,

148
00:07:09,964 --> 00:07:13,222
and um, I'm reversing my brain tumor,

149
00:07:13,222 --> 00:07:17,541
and I'm vegan, uh, and
I live in California,

150
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,291
and I'm chasing my dream, and uh.

151
00:07:21,545 --> 00:07:26,053
Wow, it just feels
amazing to chase my dream,

152
00:07:26,053 --> 00:07:29,878
and I know, you know, my
story might be the opposite

153
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:33,711
of most people, because
most people, you know,

154
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,976
wanna chase their dream of success,

155
00:07:36,976 --> 00:07:40,019
but the same rules I believe apply,

156
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:43,352
that, you know, if somethin's not right,

157
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:48,778
and you're stuck, and you feel like it's.

158
00:07:50,714 --> 00:07:52,692
If you felt like how I did?

159
00:07:52,692 --> 00:07:54,457
Like, I felt stuck.

160
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:55,363
I felt depressed.

161
00:07:55,363 --> 00:07:57,163
I felt like there were no answers,

162
00:07:57,163 --> 00:07:59,288
and I would just look on social media,

163
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:02,932
and everybody seemed to be so perfect,

164
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:05,847
um, I want you to know that,

165
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:08,514
you know, we're all not perfect.

166
00:08:10,474 --> 00:08:11,735
We're all gonna do somethin',

167
00:08:11,735 --> 00:08:14,656
it's just none of us
show our vulnerability,

168
00:08:14,656 --> 00:08:17,331
and, um, I wanna let you know that

169
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,664
if you're stuck,

170
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:23,180
that, you know, there is somebody like you

171
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,185
who felt stuck and couldn't figure it out,

172
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:28,614
and look out in to the world and see that

173
00:08:28,614 --> 00:08:31,232
it just seemed like
everybody had it figured out,

174
00:08:31,232 --> 00:08:34,544
but that's the message that I wanna give,

175
00:08:34,544 --> 00:08:38,133
because I've seen both
sides of the spectrum,

176
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:40,967
of the business, chasing my dream,

177
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:45,621
and the health, chasing my dream.

178
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:49,535
And I want you to know
that there's a community

179
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:52,217
of people who will help you if you jump

180
00:08:52,217 --> 00:08:53,790
in the swimming pool,

181
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,186
you can't just put your toe in,

182
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:57,768
but you gotta jump,

183
00:08:57,768 --> 00:09:00,968
and when you jump, you've gotta learn

184
00:09:00,968 --> 00:09:04,885
really really really
fast, or you're gonna die.

185
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:09,143
And, when I jumped in, I realized

186
00:09:09,143 --> 00:09:12,715
that when I was strugglin',
there were so many people

187
00:09:12,715 --> 00:09:14,703
there to help me.

188
00:09:14,703 --> 00:09:18,473
Like, I was scared to make that big jump,

189
00:09:18,473 --> 00:09:22,873
but then once I realized
that all these amazing people

190
00:09:22,873 --> 00:09:25,457
jumped in and helped me,

191
00:09:25,457 --> 00:09:27,707
that means I can try again.

192
00:09:41,835 --> 00:00:00,000
(uplifting music)
