12
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">people gloss over the stories even</font>

13
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,810
though they know them like when you're

14
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,460
speaking three to four thousand dollars

15
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,250

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,739
every weekend and every summer vacation

23
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,680
so I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just waltz in 22 after party</font>

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,570
for four years the school I'm like all

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,520
of days<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I ever ran the operations</font>

29
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,430
and spoke to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual customers that</font>

30
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,979
actually bought things and ask them so

31
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,290
many questions could you imagine me and

32
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,390
16 you<font color="#CCCCCC"> meant to welcome to a liquor</font>

33
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,680
store and<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing the 16 year old me</font>

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,840

36
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,500
stuff Frank so I built<font color="#E5E5E5"> up so much</font>

37
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,780
knowledge that you know I walked in

38
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">there with context too many people in</font>

39
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,009
this room<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when I'm in this room I</font>

40
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,930
mean the world jump in the businesses

41
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,329
that they know nothing about bout if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

42
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,820
let's start a startup yo let's start a

43
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,680
music start-up because I listen to music

44
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">are you at the asshole you're going into</font>

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,159
the music business not listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

46
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">fuckin ASAP rocky you did you know so so</font>

48
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,990
being smart about those decisions I

49
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,759
think too many people are jumping in too

50
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,229
fast too many people are starting

51
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,909
companies without knowing the space the

52
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,649
hurdles and they get caught and they get

53
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,299
in trouble now they get great learning

54
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,579
says very honestly if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> between 21</font>

55
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:00,220
and 20

56
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,140
728 I don't know what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right number</font>

57
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,180
is be risky as hell make a ton of

58
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,640
mistakes it is the time it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect</font>

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,460
sleep in a little pot for dudes do it

60
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,980
like all in like go really wrong as the

61
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,530
learnings are tremendous on the flip

62
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,450
side you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could also go work for some</font>

63
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,310
