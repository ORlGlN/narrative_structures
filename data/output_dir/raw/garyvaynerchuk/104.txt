1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,454
- What up vlog?

2
00:00:01,454 --> 00:00:02,829
Early morning,

3
00:00:02,829 --> 00:00:03,662
Saturday.

4
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,110
You're about to watch a
really interesting meeting

5
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,988
I had with two dudes.

6
00:00:08,988 --> 00:00:10,656
Two great guys from Connecticut.

7
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:12,919
I went real specific advice.

8
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:15,910
Obviously, the $1.80 strategy on Instagram

9
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,733
has hit pay dirt for a lot of you.

10
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:19,864
The 2017 Flip Challenge.

11
00:00:19,864 --> 00:00:21,653
I'm trying to force
myself to give you guys

12
00:00:21,653 --> 00:00:25,512
more black and white tactical advice.

13
00:00:25,512 --> 00:00:26,794
I think this is it.

14
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,249
This interview kills it.

15
00:00:28,249 --> 00:00:29,670
Enjoy it.

16
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,337
(hip hop beats)

17
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:37,482
What's cooking?

18
00:00:37,482 --> 00:00:39,076
- Nice to meet you Vayne.
- Nice to meet you.

19
00:00:39,076 --> 00:00:40,025
- I've been watching you for a long time.

20
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:41,012
- [Vayne] Thank you man.
- Yeah.

21
00:00:41,012 --> 00:00:41,845
- Thank you man.

22
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:43,003
So what's going on,
what can I help you with

23
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:46,003
in this short period of time we got?

24
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:49,002
- I don't think it's anything specific.

25
00:00:49,002 --> 00:00:50,209
You remember our interaction last month?

26
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:51,707
- Mm-hmm.

27
00:00:51,707 --> 00:00:54,529
- We wanted to come meet you guys.

28
00:00:54,529 --> 00:00:56,103
I run my own business at this point,

29
00:00:56,103 --> 00:00:58,186
I'm looking to see if ...

30
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:01,499
I really want to come here and see ...

31
00:01:01,499 --> 00:01:02,795
- It?
- This environment,

32
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:04,495
and see if it's something I want to pursue

33
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:06,331
as a personal brand.

34
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:07,292
- Good for you.

35
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:08,974
- Yes, so I sell a lot
of physical products

36
00:01:08,974 --> 00:01:10,891
now on Amazon, Shopify.

37
00:01:12,486 --> 00:01:15,033
I usually partner with YouTubers

38
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,092
and have them direct
traffic to Shopify stores.

39
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:17,925
- Yeah.

40
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:20,222
- It's kind of a turning point now

41
00:01:20,222 --> 00:01:21,748
and I figured this is
actually a great time

42
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,593
to meet you and see if
this is something to ...

43
00:01:23,593 --> 00:01:27,151
- Give me the story from the get.

44
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:29,308
- I left my job about three years ago.

45
00:01:29,308 --> 00:01:31,975
I was working at Life America.

46
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:32,971
About a week after I found out

47
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:35,236
I was having my second
child I decided to leave.

48
00:01:35,236 --> 00:01:36,483
I think it was my last chance to ...

49
00:01:36,483 --> 00:01:38,993
- Is that ...
- Go at it, so I did that.

50
00:01:38,993 --> 00:01:40,020
- It's always been in your dome?

51
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,251
- Yeah, I've been doing
this stuff since I was 16,

52
00:01:43,251 --> 00:01:46,668
ordering from overseas, reselling things.

53
00:01:47,632 --> 00:01:49,019
I did it about three years ago,

54
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:51,709
went right into getting contract jobs,

55
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:53,823
outsourcing that,

56
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:56,323
transitioning to Amazon, eBay,

57
00:01:57,764 --> 00:01:59,026
Shopify.
- And lefty.

58
00:01:59,026 --> 00:01:59,859
- Right.

59
00:02:00,943 --> 00:02:01,912
- Yeah, I've been doing that for a while.

60
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:03,027
- Arbitrage, arbitrage, arbitrage.

61
00:02:03,027 --> 00:02:04,042
- Arbitrage, arbitrage.

62
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:06,709
- What was your best little run?

63
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,826
- I do a lot of paper
products for parties,

64
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:15,707
so like baby shower, games,
wedding, photo with props.

65
00:02:15,707 --> 00:02:18,448
- I like that.
- So I sell a lot of those.

66
00:02:18,448 --> 00:02:19,281
- It's a good market.

67
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:21,678
- Yeah, low cost ...

68
00:02:21,678 --> 00:02:24,449
- Has Pinterest been a gateway
drug for your net world?

69
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:25,537
- A little bit, yeah.

70
00:02:25,537 --> 00:02:26,755
- You can if, yeah.
- I have done Pinterest

71
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:27,734
as much as I should.

72
00:02:27,734 --> 00:02:29,273
- You should man.
- [Visitor 1] Yeah.

73
00:02:29,273 --> 00:02:31,453
- You get the right pin.
- [Visitor 1] I know.

74
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:32,780
- Shit could get ridiculous.

75
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,222
- I've pinned on Pinterest before,

76
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:35,255
- [Visitor 1] I just
don't really understand

77
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,497
any traffic through Pinterest.

78
00:02:36,497 --> 00:02:38,547
- Here's the best part and
you've heard this from me,

79
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:39,504
go home after ...

80
00:02:39,504 --> 00:02:42,234
This might be the best thing
that comes out of this meeting.

81
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:44,293
Go home and be like, "How do I get traffic

82
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:45,457
"from Pinterest on Google?"

83
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,517
Just fucking give me 10 hours.

84
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:51,020
If you're still playing in
that field, you love that field

85
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,249
you give me 10 hours of watching videos,

86
00:02:53,249 --> 00:02:56,755
reading free content
and then start hacking,

87
00:02:56,755 --> 00:02:58,942
you're one pin away from insanity.

88
00:02:58,942 --> 00:03:00,007
- [Visitor 1] I believe, yeah.

89
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:00,840
- And while everybody is looking

90
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,252
at influencers in Facebook.

91
00:03:02,252 --> 00:03:03,085
- [Visitor 1] Exactly.

92
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:05,805
- And that demo against that product.

93
00:03:05,805 --> 00:03:07,191
(Vayne sighs)

94
00:03:07,191 --> 00:03:09,094
You get the right fucking infographic

95
00:03:09,094 --> 00:03:10,980
with the right Pinfluencer pinning it.

96
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,813
- [Visitor 1] Exactly.

97
00:03:11,813 --> 00:03:14,053
- Like what you feel from YouTube,

98
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:16,001
I think could be compounded by 50.

99
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:16,934
- [Visitor 1] Through Pinterest?

100
00:03:16,934 --> 00:03:18,294
- For cheaper.
- [Visitor 1] Really?

101
00:03:18,294 --> 00:03:20,237
- Because their market is not as hot,

102
00:03:20,237 --> 00:03:22,002
so they're taking money, right?

103
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,531
- [Visitor 1] Yeah.

104
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:25,489
- But the traffic is bonkers.

105
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:26,816
- [Visitor 1] Yeah.
- On the right pin.

106
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:27,649
- [Visitor 1] Exactly.

107
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:29,718
- You get the right one.
- [Visitor 1] Yeah.

108
00:03:29,718 --> 00:03:30,717
I've been a little of centric

109
00:03:30,717 --> 00:03:32,613
party stuff and wedding stuff.

110
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:33,717
- You need to look at it man.

111
00:03:33,717 --> 00:03:35,260
- [Visitor 1] Yeah.

112
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,983
- Because this is search engine,

113
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:41,287
and you get the right
pin to be above the fold,

114
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,287
or the fifth one in the feed around,

115
00:03:45,936 --> 00:03:49,183
invites or ...
- [Visitor 1] Exactly.

116
00:03:49,183 --> 00:03:52,545
- Baby shower gifts,
shit could get bonkers.

117
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:54,165
- [Visitor 1] Sure, I understand yeah.

118
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:54,998
- Got it?
- [Visitor 1] Yeah.

119
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:58,635
- 10 hours, just lying in bed reading.

120
00:03:58,635 --> 00:04:00,873
Watching videos and be like, "Oh, okay."

121
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:01,739
- [Visitor 1] I do it with everything,

122
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,244
I just haven't got to
that Pinterest of yet.

123
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:07,223
- It's funny about short interactions,

124
00:04:07,223 --> 00:04:08,490
you try to bring the most value.

125
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,272
If that's your answer to my question,

126
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:13,212
then you better get fucking
focused on Pinterest.

127
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,987
- [Visitor 1] Yeah, I will.
- Cool.

128
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:15,820
- [Visitor 1] Yeah.

129
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,252
- Because it's all demos, right?

130
00:04:17,252 --> 00:04:18,101
- [Visitor 1] Exactly, yeah.

131
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:19,742
- It's like, who are you trying to reach?

132
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:22,476
27-year-old kids, SnapChat matters,

133
00:04:22,476 --> 00:04:25,180
54-year-old executives, nope.

134
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,013
You know?
- [Visitor 1] Sure.

135
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:27,898
- Even Pinterest hasn't
come out of my mouth

136
00:04:27,898 --> 00:04:30,761
in fucking 45 episodes.
- [Visitor 1] Yeah.

137
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:32,258
- It's the answer to that question.

138
00:04:32,258 --> 00:04:33,503
- [Visitor 1] That's true, yeah.

139
00:04:33,503 --> 00:04:34,336
- [Visitor 2] I have that feeling too.

140
00:04:34,336 --> 00:04:36,021
- Everybody is trying to catch what's hot

141
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:38,004
without being smart about
what they actually sell.

142
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:39,770
- [Visitor 1] Exactly.
- Okay, cool.

143
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,603
What else?

144
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:44,491
Remind me, this part I can't connect

145
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:46,367
with our last interaction.

146
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:49,250
Wanted to get a taste of
this world for what purpose?

147
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,253
- [Visitor 1] I'm trying
to see if it's something

148
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:52,243
I want to pursue as a personal brand.

149
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:56,638
I'm more of a introvert, I
like to do things quietly.

150
00:04:56,638 --> 00:04:58,537
You grew up in the '90s, it's like ...

151
00:04:58,537 --> 00:05:00,435
- Yeah, I get it.

152
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:01,268
- [Visitor 2] You do things quietly.

153
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,299
- My DNA didn't allow me
to, but I know the culture

154
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:04,614
was definitely not where it is now,

155
00:05:04,614 --> 00:05:06,495
where every 14-year-old thinks
they're going to be a star.

156
00:05:06,495 --> 00:05:07,668
- [Visitor 1] Exactly, so I'm trying to

157
00:05:07,668 --> 00:05:08,753
determine whether that's something

158
00:05:08,753 --> 00:05:09,804
I want to pursue.

159
00:05:09,804 --> 00:05:11,957
- For what purpose?

160
00:05:11,957 --> 00:05:12,954
To create more business opportunity?

161
00:05:12,954 --> 00:05:14,240
- [Visitor 1] Exactly.

162
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,073
- How?
- The leverage, demand is ...

163
00:05:15,073 --> 00:05:17,513
- Leverage to more of
your retail arbitrage

164
00:05:17,513 --> 00:05:19,736
or write a book or speak?

165
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,336
- [Visitor 1] I don't know if
I want to go into that world.

166
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:23,830
I don't know if physical
products is really,

167
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,173
will allow me to have
the lifestyle I want,

168
00:05:25,173 --> 00:05:27,180
because that's really what I'm chasing.

169
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,825
- I think physical product will let you

170
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:30,446
have the lifestyle you want if you make

171
00:05:30,446 --> 00:05:31,928
the commitment to build a brand.

172
00:05:31,928 --> 00:05:34,425
- [Visitor 1] Of course, yeah.

173
00:05:34,425 --> 00:05:38,010
- Let me phrase, you can
make a million dollars.

174
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,164
There's plenty of retail arbitrage.

175
00:05:40,164 --> 00:05:42,501
As you know, it's an always ongoing game.

176
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:44,065
- [Visitor 1] Sure.
- But don't get it twisted,

177
00:05:44,065 --> 00:05:46,788
so is being a personal brand.
- [Visitor 1] Of course.

178
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:48,934
- You know how it is.

179
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:51,259
Everyone is like, "Oh, I
wish I was a barber," until.

180
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:53,004
"I wish I was a basketball
player," until you are one

181
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:54,348
and you burn out your knee.

182
00:05:54,348 --> 00:05:55,390
The grass man.

183
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:59,010
That grass is green as shit
on everybody else's lawn.

184
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,017
- [Visitor 1] Do you get burnt
out from the camera running?

185
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:02,990
- No, but I ...

186
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,057
- [Visitor 1] You're a
certain type of person.

187
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:07,010
- I'm a certain type of
person, I found my zone.

188
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,733
I sat through a parent-teacher
conference as a group

189
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:14,332
and like four minutes in I was sleeping.

190
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,818
You got to play to your strengths.

191
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:17,172
[Visitor 1] Sure.

192
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:21,226
- And so, if you're
naturally an introvert,

193
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:22,192
you don't want to force it

194
00:06:22,192 --> 00:06:23,457
because you think the money is there.

195
00:06:23,457 --> 00:06:24,755
You may force because because,

196
00:06:24,755 --> 00:06:25,967
okay, you're an introvert because of this

197
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:27,289
but you don't mind.

198
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:29,003
And you don't have to be a showman.

199
00:06:29,003 --> 00:06:31,259
There's plenty of people
crushing video that are, keeping.

200
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,235
- [Visitor 1] If it's there, yeah.

201
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:33,068
- Of course.

202
00:06:33,068 --> 00:06:37,256
If you got good information,
everything is an opportunity.

203
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:39,164
- [Visitor 1] I really like to try and,

204
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:40,417
I don't know if you know Al Haymon.

205
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:41,250
- Of course.

206
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,190
- [Visitor 1] I like his.
- I'm a huge boxing fan.

207
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,789
- [Visitor 1] Yeah, me too.

208
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:46,221
- [Visitor 2] I'll check
on fight this week.

209
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:47,491
- Yeah, it coming, it's ...

210
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,574
- [Visitor 1] Next month.

211
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:53,832
- Listen, I get it.

212
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:57,075
There's a lot of sex appeal
in being the mysterious guy

213
00:06:57,075 --> 00:06:59,792
behind the scenes making
real fucking coin.

214
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:01,208
I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

215
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,041
- [Visitor 1] Exactly, yeah.

216
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,710
- Especially if that's like anybody

217
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,524
who knows who Al Haymon is,

218
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:07,794
and then puts him on that pedestal.

219
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,288
I almost think that's the answer.

220
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:10,519
- [Visitor 1] Yeah, I do too.

221
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,903
Over the last two weeks I've kind of come

222
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:13,642
to that definitely.
- Conclusion, yeah.

223
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,306
- [Visitor 1] I've just started
to reach out to YouTubers

224
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:16,931
and I'm actually building a few sites

225
00:07:16,931 --> 00:07:19,520
for a few of them to run
their markets through

226
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,221
so I can have them drive
the traffic to the shop.

227
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:22,836
- I think the biggest thing
that you need to understand,

228
00:07:22,836 --> 00:07:24,270
the difference between Al's game

229
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,484
and doing it for influencers,

230
00:07:25,484 --> 00:07:27,293
is the influencers have disproportionate

231
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:30,824
more leverage than the boxers do.

232
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:34,509
- [Visitor 1] Because they have
the audience following them.

233
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:36,003
- And they also have
unlimited distribution.

234
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:38,500
They can do it anywhere
they want for free.

235
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,542
They don't need the money up front.

236
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:42,789
AdSense is their bank.

237
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:45,212
- [Visitor 1] Exactly.

238
00:07:45,212 --> 00:07:47,223
- Think you're right, but I think

239
00:07:47,223 --> 00:07:51,556
it's a very different
game to represent fighters

240
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:54,996
as it is to, not to mention
representing fighters

241
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:57,006
when you make a deal with
CBS up front and you've got

242
00:07:57,006 --> 00:08:00,053
the leverage and the
dollars and the exposure.

243
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:01,342
You can't fight anywhere else,

244
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:03,043
and there are like two options.

245
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:05,137
That's not what an influencer is doing.

246
00:08:05,137 --> 00:08:06,451
They have eight million
people reaching out to them

247
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:08,662
to manage and get into their pockets

248
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:10,548
and help them and make
their pockets bigger.

249
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:12,317
They have unlimited distribution.

250
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:13,752
They can be big anywhere.

251
00:08:13,752 --> 00:08:17,005
SnapChat, Instagram and
Facebook don't charge.

252
00:08:17,005 --> 00:08:18,403
- [Visitor 1] Right, sure.
- Got it?

253
00:08:18,403 --> 00:08:21,527
So just make sure you're not
trying to deploy strategy

254
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:24,302
that works in one world theoretically

255
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:26,190
being behind the scenes making that coin.

256
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,023
- [Visitor 1] That's what I mean.

257
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:27,978
- Yeah, I understood
that's what you meant,

258
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:29,249
but make sure you don't try to be

259
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:30,943
too direct with the blueprint,

260
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,732
because the same variables don't exist.

261
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:35,482
- [Visitor 1] Of course, yeah.

262
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:36,505
- Where do you live?

263
00:08:36,505 --> 00:08:37,464
- [Visitor 1] Connecticut.

264
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:38,297
- Where?

265
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:39,456
- [Visitor 1] Manchester.

266
00:08:39,456 --> 00:08:40,289
- It's cool.

267
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,121
- [Visitor 1] It's a good little drive.

268
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,797
- Yeah, I was going to say.

269
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:47,495
- Anything else that you
want to definitely ask?

270
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:48,462
- [Visitor 1] I dint
have anything specific.

271
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,687
I just wanted to come
here and see it for myself

272
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,777
and see if this is
something I want to pursue.

273
00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:54,056
- Good.
- [Visitor 1] So, yeah.

274
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:55,970
- [Visitor 2] Great
opportunity for me, yeah.

275
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:56,803
- Tell me about yourself.

276
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,790
- Grew up together, went to Connecticut.

277
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,725
We grew up playing ball,
very diverse high school

278
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:04,212
got exposed to a lot.

279
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:07,693
And I'm actually a moon lighter,
so I have a full-time gig,

280
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:09,859
director of engineering
at Traveler Casualty,

281
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:11,688
we're at downtown Hartford.

282
00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:12,616
- The insurance company?

283
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:14,198
- Yes.

284
00:09:14,198 --> 00:09:17,730
But as soon as I leave
work, tend to the family

285
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,231
then I get to grinding.

286
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:20,064
- The late nights.

287
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:24,283
- Direct messaging, so SMS, text to speech

288
00:09:24,283 --> 00:09:27,257
and also email, mail messaging.

289
00:09:27,257 --> 00:09:31,727
My clients currently maybe just
for emergency notification,

290
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:33,546
general distribution of information,

291
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:36,496
we're getting it in front
of their audience on time.

292
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:38,195
Right now I'm figuring out, okay.

293
00:09:38,195 --> 00:09:39,539
- Do you have a SaaS business

294
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:42,506
or do you have a client service business?

295
00:09:42,506 --> 00:09:43,946
- SaaS.

296
00:09:43,946 --> 00:09:45,483
Skymarin.com

297
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:46,905
- Good for you man.

298
00:09:46,905 --> 00:09:47,844
How's the going?

299
00:09:47,844 --> 00:09:49,182
- [Visitor 2] It's good so far.

300
00:09:49,182 --> 00:09:50,960
- How are you creating
the funnel of clients,

301
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,846
word of mouth or are you running some ads?

302
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:54,476
- [Visitor 2] So it's
going to be Facebook ads.

303
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:57,160
We've just finished a new
round to the animation.

304
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,893
It's going to be targeted Facebook ads

305
00:09:58,893 --> 00:10:00,490
for a specific demographics.

306
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,483
- Love it.

307
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:02,316
- [Visitor 2] And run it.

308
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:04,983
- Anything I can answer for you?

309
00:10:07,504 --> 00:10:10,005
- [Visitor 2] Market research
was challenging for me.

310
00:10:10,005 --> 00:10:10,940
- Figuring out who?

311
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,218
- [Visitor 2] Yeah, figuring out that ...

312
00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:13,300
- It's a tough one really.

313
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,499
- [Visitor 2] Looking at the
administrator and your utility,

314
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:19,499
it's just like if you
don't have power you know.

315
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:23,002
You don't have gas and it's cold you know.

316
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:23,835
- You feel it.

317
00:10:23,835 --> 00:10:24,742
- [Visitor 2] Yeah.

318
00:10:24,742 --> 00:10:26,504
- But sometimes you don't
even know the difference.

319
00:10:26,504 --> 00:10:27,446
- [Visitor 1] Exactly.

320
00:10:27,446 --> 00:10:29,486
- When gas wasn't around in the beginning,

321
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:31,065
you didn't know you were missing that.

322
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:33,005
We didn't know we were
missing a cell phone

323
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:34,483
until it was there.

324
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:35,400
I get that.

325
00:10:37,197 --> 00:10:40,008
- [Visitor 2] Educating
the perspective clients.

326
00:10:40,008 --> 00:10:44,776
- Can I give you a really,
really good piece of advice?

327
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:48,266
Running something in
a 25 to 40 mile radius

328
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:50,055
around your business,

329
00:10:50,055 --> 00:10:52,060
and then making the piece of creative

330
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,000
being an invite to a free
dinner to talk about messaging.

331
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,811
All of a sudden you get collective,

332
00:10:58,811 --> 00:11:01,729
and you make it an RSVP
and you put in the copy,

333
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:03,829
first 12 people, because
you're going to have to put up

334
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,290
500 bucks for dinner.

335
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,323
Super interesting to use
Facebook as the gateway drug

336
00:11:10,323 --> 00:11:14,219
to localize business transactions
in a B2B environment.

337
00:11:14,219 --> 00:11:18,386
- [Visitor 2] Would you
target via their salary or ...

338
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:20,673
How do you target for amenities, salary?

339
00:11:20,673 --> 00:11:23,506
- Yeah, I think salary
is always a good one.

340
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:24,738
You know what towns have money

341
00:11:24,738 --> 00:11:26,482
versus ones that don't in Connecticut.

342
00:11:26,482 --> 00:11:28,979
That's sometimes a good one.

343
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,741
Employees of, if the
business is big enough.

344
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:35,218
So now you look at the 40-mile
radius of the businesses.

345
00:11:35,218 --> 00:11:38,265
Truth is, his product is pretty agnost,

346
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:41,549
a lot of people couldn't use it.

347
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:44,178
So I would cast a wider
net just to taste it,

348
00:11:44,178 --> 00:11:45,487
see the quality of it.

349
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:47,538
You could also instead of say, "First 12,"

350
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:49,455
say, "I'm going to randomly pick 12 of you

351
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:52,122
"that RSVP to invite to dinner."

352
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:55,027
then you see who RSVPs, you google them

353
00:11:55,027 --> 00:11:57,032
and look at their LinkedIn
and see who they are,

354
00:11:57,032 --> 00:11:59,280
you pick the 12 best leads.

355
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,113
Good, right?

356
00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:01,319
- [Visitor 2] Yeah.

357
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:05,482
- People think of technology,
digital or real life.

358
00:12:05,482 --> 00:12:07,263
I like mixing the two.

359
00:12:07,263 --> 00:12:10,002
I know that you'll have a much better ...

360
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:11,533
And especially make a video and be like,

361
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:12,474
"I'm going to buy you free dinner.

362
00:12:12,474 --> 00:12:14,460
"I'm the CEO of my company
or partner at my company,

363
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,527
"I'm going to buy you
dinner and educate you,"

364
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,039
and shoot the shit a little bit

365
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,989
about the new jitter jitter world, go.

366
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,558
Or some people put a name at the face.

367
00:12:23,558 --> 00:12:26,526
People decide to come, come.

368
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:28,293
There's something real human about that

369
00:12:28,293 --> 00:12:29,938
and most people are always up for ...

370
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:33,259
Again, you know what I love
about things like Connecticut?

371
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:35,301
You know exactly which restaurant people,

372
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:37,449
you know the seven
restaurants people know.

373
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:40,058
You pick one of those,
maybe you hit up two of them

374
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:40,945
and be like, "Hey, I'm going to do this.

375
00:12:40,945 --> 00:12:44,206
"Are you willing to cover the cost?"

376
00:12:44,206 --> 00:12:45,552
Entrepreneurship.
- [Visitor 1] Yeah.

377
00:12:45,552 --> 00:12:47,283
- Would pick the seven,
I'd call and be like,

378
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:48,479
"Yo, I'm running this on Facebook

379
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:49,967
"and I'm going to spend $1,000 just trying

380
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:52,019
"to get people to come to a restaurant.

381
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,481
"You guys willing to cover the meal?"

382
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,541
Yes.

383
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,028
We've been meaning to
do Facebook advertising.

384
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:59,182
I'll link you in.

385
00:12:59,182 --> 00:13:00,611
Awesome. You know?

386
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:02,507
[Visitor 2] Yeah, definitely.

387
00:13:02,507 --> 00:13:04,782
- That would work.

388
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:07,582
That's chamber of commerce 10.0.

389
00:13:07,582 --> 00:13:09,780
- [Visitor 2] Really, sure, yeah.

390
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,228
That's a great business look.

391
00:13:12,228 --> 00:13:14,582
- That's it, right?

392
00:13:14,582 --> 00:13:16,706
I think a lot of times people think

393
00:13:16,706 --> 00:13:21,225
that what got me here with
these views is the pizas,

394
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:23,221
back to rounding up this whole thing.

395
00:13:23,221 --> 00:13:24,813
What got me here was that part.

396
00:13:24,813 --> 00:13:26,222
- [Visitor 2] The ingenuity of it.

397
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,458
- Just like knowing, being
a practitioner, McGaiver.

398
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:33,735
Doing and never being too,
I'll do that shit now.

399
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:35,438
Never being too fancy for that.

400
00:13:35,438 --> 00:13:36,271
- [Visitor 2] Definitely.

401
00:13:36,271 --> 00:13:39,684
Everyone is like, "Scale
technology," nope.

402
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:42,304
- [Visitor 2] Even
corporate is coming back.

403
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:43,537
I mean, one situation now,

404
00:13:43,537 --> 00:13:46,243
you have leaders all the way up to execs

405
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:48,091
and now we get hands-on and get.

406
00:13:48,091 --> 00:13:52,395
- They have to, they're
being commoditized.

407
00:13:52,395 --> 00:13:55,812
Your NBA is nice and cute until it's not.

408
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:59,945
Shit is getting very interesting

409
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:02,112
I'm glad you guys came down.

410
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:03,147
- [Visitor 1] Appreciate it.
- [Visitor 2] I appreciate

411
00:14:03,147 --> 00:14:04,033
taking your time off.

412
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:04,973
- Anything else?

413
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:08,494
I want to give it to you
while I got you here.

414
00:14:08,494 --> 00:14:09,327
- [Visitor 1] I'm on my path.

415
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:10,533
- Good man.

416
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:11,504
- [Visitor 1] I'm glad I came here,

417
00:14:11,504 --> 00:14:13,923
I got to see it, I'm glad
I got that advice from you.

418
00:14:13,923 --> 00:14:15,274
- Good, I love it.

419
00:14:15,274 --> 00:14:16,517
- All right, thanks.

420
00:14:16,517 --> 00:14:17,350
Can I take a picture?

421
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,718
- 100%.
- Can you take the selfie?

422
00:14:18,718 --> 00:14:21,297
- Yeah.
- Watch my vision of my head.

423
00:14:21,297 --> 00:14:23,242
You take this selfie for me.

424
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:25,725
- I like doing it, because people,

425
00:14:25,725 --> 00:14:26,730
everybody has always got a ...

426
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,730
There we go.

427
00:14:30,758 --> 00:14:31,685
Love it.

428
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:32,518
My man.
- I appreciate Gary.

429
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:33,482
- I wish you well.

430
00:14:33,482 --> 00:14:36,485
Take care of yourself.
- Thank you.

431
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:37,492
- Now do me.

432
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:38,409
- Let's go.

433
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,048
Love it.

434
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:44,881
That's right.
- Yeah.

435
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:45,714
- Hey, take care of yourself.

436
00:14:45,714 --> 00:14:46,547
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

437
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:47,535
Try that, let me know how that goes.

438
00:14:47,535 --> 00:14:48,368
- I am.

439
00:14:48,368 --> 00:14:49,781
- Yeah, I think it's going to work.

440
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:52,237
Leave your two to four
cents on what you thought

441
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:53,719
of this little meeting I had.

442
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:54,981
Did you get value?

443
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:55,814
See you.

444
00:14:56,711 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
