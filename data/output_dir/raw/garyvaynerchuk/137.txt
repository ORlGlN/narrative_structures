1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,382
- I'm stuck, I'm in a rut.

2
00:00:01,382 --> 00:00:02,674
- Because?

3
00:00:02,674 --> 00:00:04,550
- Because I just finished
Army, it was two years

4
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,841
just in my regular normal life.

5
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:08,926
I just want to find out right now.

6
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,352
- You've gotta try stuff.

7
00:00:10,352 --> 00:00:13,147
The biggest reason you don't
know what you want to do

8
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:14,567
is you haven't tasted enough things

9
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:16,277
and the biggest reason you're
not tasting enough things

10
00:00:16,277 --> 00:00:20,148
is you're worried about
finding it too fast.

11
00:00:20,148 --> 00:00:21,776
Start with the finish line.

12
00:00:21,776 --> 00:00:23,944
Too many people are just
worried about tomorrow,

13
00:00:23,944 --> 00:00:27,651
go backwards from what you
want to achieve financially

14
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:30,565
and in your legacy, and
then make all your behavior

15
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:32,941
every day map to your finish line.

16
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:36,360
The way that a 20 year old
can make the world better

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,614
20 or 30 years down the
line is by making themselves

18
00:00:40,614 --> 00:00:41,697
better first.

19
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:45,117
I think people don't
realize that the way to be

20
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:47,204
selfless is to be selfish.

21
00:00:47,204 --> 00:00:51,293
Its very hard to change the
world if you're not good.

22
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:53,459
To me, when I look around
this many people being

23
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:56,048
in their 20s, like
everybody's judging themselves

24
00:00:56,048 --> 00:00:58,382
way too early, what I
would do is gather as many

25
00:00:58,382 --> 00:01:01,301
experiences as possible, you know.

26
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:04,473
You're not lost in life, you're
just early in the process.

27
00:01:04,473 --> 00:01:07,099
Good morning vlog, just
jumped on Instagram

28
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:10,142
for their live feature, and
brought people in that was

29
00:01:10,142 --> 00:01:13,809
super fun, and waiting
for Risa now, we have

30
00:01:15,683 --> 00:01:17,516
a nice solid 15, 16 hour
day that concludes here

31
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:19,142
back at the hotel.

32
00:01:19,142 --> 00:01:21,437
Feeling really good
about a lot of stuff, got

33
00:01:21,437 --> 00:01:24,351
a lot going on, I'm
very Vayner Mediaed out,

34
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,727
just to kind of give you
an update, I've been really

35
00:01:26,727 --> 00:01:28,893
focused on the offense, a
lot of incredible things

36
00:01:28,893 --> 00:01:30,934
happening at Vayner Media,
a lot of new business

37
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:33,390
coming in, a lot of
assessing talent, a lot of

38
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,560
bringing in new talent, a lot
of assessing the offerings.

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,431
But feeling incredibly
confident and very excited

40
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:42,601
about Vayner acts as a whole.

41
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:44,935
Spent a lot of time with
PureWow, you saw Ryan Harwood

42
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:47,933
in a couple episodes it was
hard to hide that beautiful face

43
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:51,185
and just incredible stuff happening.

44
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:55,352
PureWow and just in general
some really hardcore momentum

45
00:01:57,064 --> 00:01:58,231
in the Vayner X Holding company.

46
00:01:58,231 --> 00:01:59,983
I've already made some incredible
hires got three or four

47
00:01:59,983 --> 00:02:03,609
more incredible hires that are
signed sealed and delivered

48
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:05,108
and will be announced shortly.

49
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:06,660
I think a lot of people
in the advertising world

50
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,241
the ad world are going to be taken aback.

51
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:12,039
For you guys this is hard
to understand but a lot

52
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:16,167
of people in Madison Avenue
that cliche 30, 40, 50

53
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:18,500
year veteran in the ad world

54
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:23,134
doesn't respect what I'm
doing, hates the pressure

55
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:24,550
of putting on the status quo.

56
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,924
I have business meetings
where people literally spend

57
00:02:26,924 --> 00:02:30,095
the first 20 minutes talking
about Russia invading

58
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:34,102
America through it's Facebook
and (mimics stuttering)

59
00:02:34,102 --> 00:02:36,561
and then all of a sudden
we get to marketing,

60
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:37,811
and they tell me Facebook's not that big,

61
00:02:37,811 --> 00:02:39,727
they should still do television,
I'm like wait a minute

62
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:41,020
what about the first 20
minutes when you said

63
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,270
our entire governments being
overthrown by social media

64
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,736
but now to sell your blouses or your soda,

65
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:46,656
it's not important?

66
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,785
So I think the only
thing that's changed is

67
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:51,159
people's acceptance of it and it's scale.

68
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:55,954
The internet is the biggest
thing that has happened

69
00:02:55,954 --> 00:02:58,456
to human beings ever and I
don't think we realize that

70
00:02:58,456 --> 00:03:00,373
because it's too early.

71
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:05,501
My big thing is that I
think we overestimate things

72
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,087
staying the same.

73
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:11,433
Like, we're basically having
an IBM Microsoft conversation.

74
00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:15,060
The thought that Facebook
and Google will in perpetuity

75
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,769
dominate the digital landscape
is laughable at best.

76
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:21,526
Amazon's clearly gonna
be a third player in the

77
00:03:21,526 --> 00:03:22,608
next 24 months.

78
00:03:22,608 --> 00:03:25,487
Like what happens when
it's voice or it's AR or

79
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:27,698
what happens when it's VR?

80
00:03:27,698 --> 00:03:31,865
That may be 25 years away
from consumer VR at scale

81
00:03:33,736 --> 00:03:35,286
and block chain and all these things that

82
00:03:35,286 --> 00:03:36,576
are happening.

83
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,002
The destruction never really
happens because somebody

84
00:03:39,002 --> 00:03:41,629
had the guts and took
the leap, it's that they

85
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:42,881
were forced into it.

86
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:45,297
And it's coming into a
form that I didn't expect.

87
00:03:45,297 --> 00:03:48,093
It's coming in the fact
that the tv networks

88
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:52,555
are losing to OTT, so if
there's no commercials,

89
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:53,472
what do you do?

90
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,970
And it's coming in the
form of activist investors

91
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,888
disrupting the biggest
marketers in the world.

92
00:03:57,888 --> 00:03:59,889
And there's some 13 year
old girl in India right now

93
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:01,723
that Elon Musk has completely inspired,

94
00:04:01,723 --> 00:04:03,225
and what's she up to?

95
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:07,945
So I think it's interesting
because I look around

96
00:04:07,945 --> 00:04:09,816
and some of us are younger
than others, I think it's

97
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,112
gonna be a good chunk of our
lives, what we're talking

98
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:13,828
about over the next 10,
15 years, and I think the

99
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:17,995
biggest thing I've learned
is man, everything we think,

100
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,125
don't let Facebook own
everything, don't let Amazon

101
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,213
own everything, don't let
the two China companies own

102
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:25,046
everything the problem
is everything changes.

103
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:27,967
And so, I don't think it's
bad, 'cause I don't think

104
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,384
it's sustainable.

105
00:04:30,678 --> 00:04:33,138
- Why do you think it's not sustainable?

106
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:36,890
- 'cause it's never been
historically sustainable.

107
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,137
No company has ever run a 50 year run

108
00:04:38,137 --> 00:04:40,137
on controlling anything.

109
00:04:43,347 --> 00:04:44,438
Like retail is gonna
start spending more money

110
00:04:44,438 --> 00:04:46,522
with you guys, because
they're about to go out

111
00:04:46,522 --> 00:04:47,690
of business, all of them.

112
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,488
Like somebody woke up
this morning and said wow,

113
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:53,573
Lord and Taylor's store
shut down in Manhattan,

114
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:55,071
like it's just real.

115
00:04:55,071 --> 00:04:56,948
It's when Toys R Us goes out of business.

116
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:59,698
Then the other retailers
are like wait a minute,

117
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:02,788
this is not gonna happen
because of a good thing,

118
00:05:02,788 --> 00:05:04,543
this is gonna happen
because of a bad thing.

119
00:05:04,543 --> 00:05:06,588
Brands are gonna change
their behavior because

120
00:05:06,588 --> 00:05:09,465
when they start looking around and saying,

121
00:05:09,465 --> 00:05:11,913
we're next, they're gonna get scared.

122
00:05:11,913 --> 00:05:14,543
They're gonna do it out
of defense, not offense.

123
00:05:14,543 --> 00:05:16,715
Which is very unfortunate.

124
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:18,798
Like Polo's gonna go out of business.

125
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:21,676
That's it, right, huge gone.

126
00:05:21,676 --> 00:05:25,676
So real systematic
disruption happens on defense

127
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:28,593
not offense.

128
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:30,431
Problem is it doesn't matter
what they like, it doesn't

129
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,481
matter what I want to happen.

130
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:35,023
We're sold to the executioner
in a fucking game.

131
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:37,066
And that's what I focus on.

132
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:40,472
Period, just 'cause I
figured out how to storytell

133
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:44,472
in a modern way with
incredible human beings and

134
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:47,407
infrastructure team and
strategies and unbelivable

135
00:05:47,407 --> 00:05:49,739
understanding of the
modern fucking ecosystem.

136
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:51,948
Doesn't take away from
the fact that I'm fucking

137
00:05:51,948 --> 00:05:56,159
executing 17 hours a day
as a CEO of an 800 person,

138
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,734
150 million dollar plus holding company.

139
00:05:57,734 --> 00:05:58,946
And you know what?

140
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:00,155
I'm super fucking proud of it.

141
00:06:00,155 --> 00:06:02,651
No question, I'm more proud
of me, the executive than

142
00:06:02,651 --> 00:06:06,315
me the personality, it's not even close.

143
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:09,692
Now the impact on the
hundreds of emails that

144
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:12,649
I get from you every day
about the impact I've had

145
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:15,318
one way or the other,
motivation or execution,

146
00:06:15,318 --> 00:06:19,031
that's a bigger legacy than
the company that I'm building.

147
00:06:19,031 --> 00:06:22,241
So I'm scratching both
itches and I'm not too

148
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:24,285
worried about other
people's opinions on it.

149
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:27,785
Because I know what the
finish line looks like.

150
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:30,742
(tongue clicking)

151
00:06:30,742 --> 00:06:31,744
By the way just to clarify
that wink was the fuck you

152
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:33,866
to everybody who thinks
they're gonna beat me.

153
00:06:33,866 --> 00:06:35,453
It's how I roll.

154
00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:37,497
You've gotta know if you're
gonna go up to 20 to 27

155
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,333
and you're gonna defeat
all these competitors,

156
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,209
you're gonna have to start younger.

157
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:44,334
Their behavior's happening at 15, 16, 17

158
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:47,542
they're selling to each
other, they're buying clothes

159
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:51,960
off each other and sneakers
and slime on Instagram.

160
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,797
The behavior starts
earlier and so we're gonna

161
00:06:53,797 --> 00:06:56,921
have to think about that
in some shape or form.

162
00:06:56,921 --> 00:06:58,789
I understand that you have
different restrictions

163
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:01,751
maybe you guys fund a
start up that you have

164
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:05,499
the option to buy, this
needs very smart thinking,

165
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:07,752
but you're not gonna win
if you spend $100 million

166
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:09,044
on 20 to 27.

167
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:11,292
D-rock, your favorite game.

168
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:12,375
- [Man] Oh yeah, oh my God.

169
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,542
- You're so good at this game, D-rock.

170
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:23,601
- [Man] Oh shit.

171
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:27,101
- Hey man, (crosstalking)

172
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,080
- How are you?

173
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,970
- Yeah, doing well, busier than ever.

174
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,425
That's a bit of a shock, to be honest.

175
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:37,042
- I didn't tell him I was
gonna do that, (inaudible)

176
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:39,083
you'll get to speak with him later.

177
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,871
- I don't want to bother
you, but, real pleasure.

178
00:07:40,871 --> 00:07:42,576
- Nice to meet ya.

179
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:44,282
- Yeah I'll see you in a little bit.

180
00:07:44,282 --> 00:07:47,067
I think you should be thinking
about audio very aggressively

181
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,854
nobody in your space
has won the podcast, I

182
00:07:49,854 --> 00:07:51,648
think it's hugely open.

183
00:07:51,648 --> 00:07:55,815
I think, I can't believe
that BuzzFeed and 9gag and

184
00:07:57,524 --> 00:07:59,136
you guys and others haven't
gone into the podcast.

185
00:07:59,136 --> 00:08:03,259
Now it's hard, you gotta
do a meme radio show.

186
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:05,337
- What do you do in a
podcast industry in Singapore

187
00:08:05,337 --> 00:08:08,091
is not picking up, I mean
it picked up the U.S.

188
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:09,508
But in Singapore.

189
00:08:09,508 --> 00:08:11,972
- You try to, the first thing
I would do is look at it

190
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:14,378
and see how true that is,
because don't forget again

191
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:17,918
it's always hard when a country's small.

192
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:20,961
So it might be picking up
it's just proportionate.

193
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:24,041
You know 300 million or back to Indonesia,

194
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:28,041
like Indonesia, 250 million
if it's five million

195
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:33,291
if 50,000 are doing it that means a lot so

196
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,201
you just have to look
what that means, and then

197
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:38,823
the question for them
becomes, I think with the 9gag

198
00:08:38,823 --> 00:08:41,149
thing, you have to be smart about like,

199
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:42,726
so what's this?

200
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:45,278
Is that the holding company,

201
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:46,694
but it's not consumer facing?

202
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:47,527
- It's not.

203
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:51,360
- So I would probably
use a podcast for all of

204
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,817
Southeast Asia and use
that as the opportunity

205
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:56,569
this is where I do strategy.

206
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,525
I would use a podcast which will leapfrog

207
00:08:59,525 --> 00:09:02,566
your competitors that's
where I would probably

208
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:05,736
establish the brand that's
the consumer facing holding

209
00:09:05,736 --> 00:09:09,858
of Mgag, Sgag, I'd probably
not use gag because

210
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:11,361
you don't want to,

211
00:09:11,361 --> 00:09:13,901
I mean I was an investor
but I've seen 'em once

212
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:15,905
on my trip to Hong Kong the other day,

213
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:17,653
so I don't have any
disproportionate feelings toward

214
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:18,653
9gag or not.

215
00:09:18,653 --> 00:09:20,870
You'd probably want to be
smart about how you think

216
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,537
about it, that's how I
would think about it.

217
00:09:27,621 --> 00:09:31,788
You have to understand, so
it's like Uber, or Facebook

218
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:34,696
podcasting has won here,
let me tell you why.

219
00:09:34,696 --> 00:09:38,863
Audio is gonna win with human
beings 'cause it saves time.

220
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:42,426
So some things are binary.

221
00:09:42,426 --> 00:09:44,426
And human, not cultural.

222
00:09:44,426 --> 00:09:45,593
Time is human.

223
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,525
So it will win here.

224
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:50,071
Just updating just had an
awesome meeting with some

225
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:53,988
incredibly intriguing
Singaporean entrepreneurs

226
00:09:55,987 --> 00:09:59,352
and, I'm ready, just vlogging
over here, no big deal

227
00:09:59,352 --> 00:10:01,061
just a little vlogging.

228
00:10:01,061 --> 00:10:03,819
Vlog, just to catch you
up, D-rock and I have been

229
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:05,775
doing this, we're traveling
here, chatting for

230
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:08,695
the last little bit and I
was about to say something

231
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:10,777
I was like hey, pick up
the camera because it's

232
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,981
gonna really help people.

233
00:10:11,981 --> 00:10:14,562
I think our ambition, if
you listen to D-rock and I

234
00:10:14,562 --> 00:10:17,096
talk for the last 15
minutes you guys would laugh

235
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:20,636
because we're basically shitting
on everything we're doing

236
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:24,519
content-wise and in a good
way, we're just critiquing

237
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,355
and I was about to say, I
want to catch it on film

238
00:10:28,355 --> 00:10:29,570
'cause it's so important.

239
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,737
Our ambition to be great
is driving this whole thing

240
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:38,154
way way way more than I
think people would realize.

241
00:10:38,154 --> 00:10:41,812
For us to be at a standard
of content output and quality

242
00:10:41,812 --> 00:10:45,147
that we're at, then
let's call it what it is,

243
00:10:45,147 --> 00:10:49,016
it's really hard for
another human being to claim

244
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,396
that they're at this
level, we're just fucking

245
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:52,512
bringing it right now
across all platforms,

246
00:10:52,512 --> 00:10:55,470
audio, written, video,
all different networks.

247
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,137
LinkedIn, Facebook,
Instagram, Snap, and yet

248
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:03,877
we're at three to five percent
of what we could be doing

249
00:11:03,877 --> 00:11:06,126
we just have so much to do.

250
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:07,578
Obviously every time I'm in Asia, I'm like

251
00:11:07,578 --> 00:11:09,328
we gotta transcribe every
fucking piece of content

252
00:11:09,328 --> 00:11:12,323
to every fucking language.

253
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:15,156
There's so much more to be done.

254
00:11:15,156 --> 00:11:19,657
That video that got over
a million views Instagram

255
00:11:19,657 --> 00:11:20,646
about the YouTuber kid,
I feel like there's five

256
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:24,646
of them a week, but we're
not putting those out.

257
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:29,477
God there's a lot to do.

258
00:11:29,477 --> 00:11:31,306
- I think law of attraction
works in a lot of ways.

259
00:11:31,306 --> 00:11:33,391
- I'm a very big believer.

260
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:34,477
- Like from a year just
watching you to seeing

261
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:37,727
you in Hong Kong today, I think it was.

262
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:43,728
- Be humbled, be hungry, be
hard working and be selfish

263
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:45,482
first before you can be selfless.

264
00:11:45,482 --> 00:11:47,314
- I do, I think it's very
hard to help if you're

265
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:49,354
not from a position of helping.

266
00:11:49,354 --> 00:11:52,889
I see so many young people
rightfully so and it makes

267
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:57,056
me admire them be so
altruistic, yet they're so weak

268
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:01,060
inside themselves, so
they put up a facade,

269
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,182
because they act as though
they want to help the world

270
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:08,649
as a way to build confidence,
it's a facade, it's ego.

271
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:12,395
And that's fine and it's a
lot better than other things,

272
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:15,682
so I don't judge, it's
just I wasn't able to give

273
00:12:15,682 --> 00:12:18,436
this much back until I
scratched a couple things

274
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:19,353
for myself.

275
00:12:20,602 --> 00:12:23,312
And I think about that,
it's tough to give from

276
00:12:23,312 --> 00:12:28,190
a place of instability
and whether it's financial

277
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,523
or street cred or whatever one needs,

278
00:12:30,523 --> 00:12:32,315
I always want somebody
to get theirs first,

279
00:12:32,315 --> 00:12:34,398
so that they can give later.

280
00:12:34,398 --> 00:12:38,052
I genuinely think about
the things like that.

281
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:40,464
You can't build a beautiful
room and be a great

282
00:12:40,464 --> 00:12:44,377
interior decorator unless
you're a great contractor

283
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:46,711
and build a great steel
foundation for that building.

284
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:50,381
- Absolutely something
that kind of weathers true.

285
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:52,383
- And that then gets into my patience.

286
00:12:52,383 --> 00:12:56,014
In your 20s and 30s, pour
concrete and build steel,

287
00:12:56,014 --> 00:12:58,058
don't worry about putting fucking curtains

288
00:12:58,058 --> 00:13:01,308
or what color to paint the room, right?

289
00:13:02,852 --> 00:13:04,746
Your biggest advantage is your youth.

290
00:13:04,746 --> 00:13:07,538
And too many kids don't
take advantage of time.

291
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:11,621
They're in such a rush to
find it, or be doing it

292
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:15,691
that they don't take advantage
of the thing that they have

293
00:13:15,691 --> 00:13:18,325
which is, you could do
nothing successful for the

294
00:13:18,325 --> 00:13:20,660
next eight years, how old are you?

295
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,698
- 22.

296
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:25,116
- You can literally do nothing
for the next eight years

297
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:28,568
and be a child, but you don't think that.

298
00:13:28,568 --> 00:13:33,354
Because when you're 22, you
don't think 31 is young.

299
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,770
But it is.

300
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,610
- Okay thank you so much.

301
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,117
- Patience, patience,
whether it's your parents,

302
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:42,905
or yourself, or people,
everybody's trying to prove

303
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,531
something so early.

304
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:47,525
- Maybe that's the problem with youth.

305
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:51,608
- It's, everybody's got
strengths and weaknesses.

306
00:13:52,652 --> 00:13:56,060
What a 60 year old has is
experience but doesn't have time.

307
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,768
So they trade on experience.

308
00:13:57,768 --> 00:13:59,812
What youth has is time.

309
00:13:59,812 --> 00:14:01,392
You can literally do four
different things over the

310
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:03,728
next two years, six months
at a time to figure out

311
00:14:03,728 --> 00:14:06,185
everything that you think you might like,

312
00:14:06,185 --> 00:14:07,935
you should try to do.

313
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,224
But that's not what people tell you to do.

314
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:12,222
- Yeah (inaudible)

315
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:13,764
- 100%.

316
00:14:13,764 --> 00:14:14,970
- Thank you so much.

317
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,052
- You're welcome.

318
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:17,591
You're not lost in life, you're
just early in the process.

319
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:19,845
You know what I mean?

320
00:14:19,845 --> 00:14:22,051
You're lost by other
people's standards, not your

321
00:14:22,051 --> 00:14:23,642
actual, if you actually
took it practically

322
00:14:23,642 --> 00:14:25,725
you haven't even started.

323
00:14:27,308 --> 00:14:28,141
- Right.

324
00:14:28,141 --> 00:14:29,750
- Too many people view
post university as like

325
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,404
oh shit this is now real and I'm lost.

326
00:14:33,404 --> 00:14:36,360
They don't put it into
context of being alive

327
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,065
for a hundred years and
realizing they're only 20%

328
00:14:39,065 --> 00:14:40,103
of the way done.

329
00:14:40,103 --> 00:14:41,139
Got it?

330
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:42,217
It's perspective.

331
00:14:42,217 --> 00:14:44,759
Almost everything I, hey everyone,

332
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,963
(laughter)

333
00:14:45,963 --> 00:14:47,298
- Oh my Gosh.

334
00:14:47,298 --> 00:14:50,215
- Almost everything is perspective.

335
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:53,468
Like I think I'm just starting

336
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:56,966
so imagine what I think for most of you?

337
00:14:56,966 --> 00:14:57,884
- Maybe.

338
00:14:57,884 --> 00:14:59,674
- Maybe, we gotta go.

339
00:14:59,674 --> 00:15:01,051
- Thanks so much Gary.

340
00:15:01,051 --> 00:15:02,175
- You're welcome.

341
00:15:02,175 --> 00:15:03,213
- See you next September.

342
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:04,259
- They're grabbing me
guys, let me just say

343
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:05,257
hello real quick.

344
00:15:05,257 --> 00:15:06,295
If you guys want to take quick
selfies, let's do it fast.

345
00:15:06,295 --> 00:15:07,832
And then I gotta go.

346
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:09,581
- I just can't believe it.

347
00:15:09,581 --> 00:15:13,165
(foreign language)

348
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:15,540
- [Woman] How do keep the drive?

349
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,166
How can you be so energetic
like this every day

350
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,491
like the question they
ask me, do you sleep?

351
00:15:21,491 --> 00:15:22,657
Are you a robot?

352
00:15:22,657 --> 00:15:24,163
(laughter)

353
00:15:24,163 --> 00:15:26,457
- I think the thing with me
that I've come to realize,

354
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:28,414
I think I have a lot of
natural DNA, there's energy

355
00:15:28,414 --> 00:15:32,581
that I have, like every time
people first come across me,

356
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,998
the amount of coments that
say that I'm on drugs,

357
00:15:35,998 --> 00:15:38,907
or things it makes me laugh,
and it makes the people

358
00:15:38,907 --> 00:15:40,533
that know me the best
laugh, 'cause I don't even

359
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:43,663
smoke a cigarette, let alone, you know.

360
00:15:43,663 --> 00:15:46,542
I mean the amount of people
that write things like

361
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:49,959
cocaine, ritalin, like you know I get it,

362
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,536
I understand why, so clearly
I have natural energy

363
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:55,190
and always have, but I do
think that energy comes

364
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,440
from gratitude.

365
00:15:57,317 --> 00:15:59,235
I'm awfully grateful.

366
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:02,909
I think that people take life for granted,

367
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:05,160
I think they take
circumstance for granted.

368
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,828
It is stunning to me that
the majority of people that

369
00:16:07,828 --> 00:16:11,995
are watching this right now
have first world problems.

370
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:15,903
I think I got very lucky
that I came from very humble

371
00:16:15,903 --> 00:16:19,320
beginnings so I know what it tastes like.

372
00:16:20,518 --> 00:16:23,094
I'm grateful, I'm grateful,
I'm really grateful.

373
00:16:23,094 --> 00:16:25,974
And that's it, you know
if you're truly purely

374
00:16:25,974 --> 00:16:30,141
grateful, you'll have more
energy than you'll ever need.

375
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,977
- That's the answer, thank you Gary.

376
00:16:33,977 --> 00:16:34,810
- You're welcome thanks for having me.

377
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,643
- Thank you so much.

378
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:36,476
- Yeah of course, goodbye.

379
00:16:36,476 --> 00:16:38,726
(applause)

380
00:16:39,818 --> 00:16:44,738
- Patience, and a lot of people
like to bullshit I guess.

381
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:46,057
And just work on your thing
I guess, just keep doing it.

382
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:48,724
That's my biggest takeaway.

383
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:53,180
- I really want to flood
as much content as I can

384
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,222
but to really bring value at the same time

385
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:59,099
to be able to come back with my audience,

386
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:00,595
that's really what I want to do.

387
00:17:00,595 --> 00:17:03,331
- I learned about being self aware,

388
00:17:03,331 --> 00:17:06,748
and about I think just being yourself and

389
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,616
similarly no bullshit.

390
00:17:10,616 --> 00:17:12,280
- I just learned everything
that I could learn

391
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,365
from Gary V basically.

392
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,233
Just about life, about marketing
and how to place myself,

393
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:18,443
position myself for the future.

394
00:17:18,443 --> 00:17:19,820
Gary V man.

395
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:24,323
- I learned that nothing is
out of the realm of possibility

396
00:17:24,324 --> 00:17:26,660
if you want to get somewhere,
you want to get in a

397
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,373
conference even if you
don't have a ticket,

398
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:29,580
you can get it.

399
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,667
- What did I learn today,
I didn't learn anything new

400
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:34,251
but I got a reinforcement
from Gary Vaynerchuk that

401
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:37,241
cut out all the bullshit,
just do the work, stop

402
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:40,453
making excuses, put in the
effort put in the time,

403
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:43,200
don't putting your energy
into useless activities like

404
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,618
you can watch Game of
Thrones when you retire,

405
00:17:45,618 --> 00:17:47,942
you can take part in Reddit
communities discussing

406
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,934
the one episode or the
other after you retire,

407
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:51,893
I'm sure they'll exist
in the future with AI but

408
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:53,973
right now is the time
to put in the work while

409
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,849
you've got the energy
so stop making excuses.

410
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:56,849
- I agree.

411
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:57,750
- Look at this guy.

412
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,583
- Douche head.

413
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,416
- Douche head.

414
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,666
(laughter)

415
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,913
- Start with the finish line.

416
00:18:14,913 --> 00:18:16,951
Too many people are just
worried about tomorrow,

417
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:19,320
go backwards from what you want to achieve

418
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,018
financially and in your
legacy, and then make

419
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,352
all your behavior every day
map to your finish line.

420
00:18:25,352 --> 00:18:28,511
I want to be a great
entrepreneur that inspires others

421
00:18:28,511 --> 00:18:31,051
that's why I'm still sitting here.

422
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:34,088
Know where your finish
line is and work backwards.

423
00:18:34,088 --> 00:00:00,000
(gentle piano music)
