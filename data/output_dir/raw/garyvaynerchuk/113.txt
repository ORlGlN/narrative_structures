1
00:00:00,093 --> 00:00:01,010
- Hey guys.

2
00:00:02,676 --> 00:00:04,535
At ComplexCon a couple weeks ago,

3
00:00:04,535 --> 00:00:07,499
my homie ASAP Ferg and I were
going to do an Ask Gary V.

4
00:00:07,499 --> 00:00:09,825
He got caught up on some business.

5
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:12,616
So what you're about to watch
is me improving a keynote

6
00:00:12,616 --> 00:00:14,002
and a Q and A session

7
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:16,941
when I was going in the
mindset of doing an Ask Gary V.

8
00:00:16,941 --> 00:00:17,967
Hope you enjoy it.

9
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:18,847
A lot of culture talk.

10
00:00:18,847 --> 00:00:20,500
A lot of attention talk.

11
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,412
Some really solid Q and A at the end.

12
00:00:22,412 --> 00:00:23,966
Have a great holiday season.

13
00:00:23,966 --> 00:00:26,133
Hope you're enjoying your
Thanksgiving weekend.

14
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:27,979
Check it, check it out.

15
00:00:27,979 --> 00:00:31,062
(funky upbeat music)

16
00:00:34,894 --> 00:00:35,727
(audience applauding)

17
00:00:35,727 --> 00:00:36,625
How are you guys?

18
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:37,458
- [Man in Audience] Great.

19
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:38,291
- Good.

20
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,247
So, obviously I had to flip my schedule,

21
00:00:40,247 --> 00:00:44,005
and the talk that I was
gonna give from five to six,

22
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:45,013
is what I'm gonna do now,

23
00:00:45,013 --> 00:00:48,110
and me and Ferg are gonna do
Ask Gary V later on today.

24
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,610
Whenever the fuck he wakes up.

25
00:00:51,722 --> 00:00:53,550
So listen, I wanna take full advantage

26
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,009
of having this much time,

27
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:56,845
and this intimate of an audience,

28
00:00:56,845 --> 00:01:00,873
so my plan is to kind of maybe
spit a couple of thoughts

29
00:01:00,873 --> 00:01:03,055
that I think could bring some value.

30
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:05,649
I'm also gonna be empathetic
to know the fact that

31
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,179
most of you have some context on me,

32
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:09,496
so I don't wanna repeat shit

33
00:01:09,496 --> 00:01:10,345
that I think you guys already know

34
00:01:10,345 --> 00:01:12,465
in this stage of us sharing thoughts

35
00:01:12,465 --> 00:01:13,929
all the time and what have you.

36
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:17,167
So, I'll talk for about five minutes

37
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:21,166
and then honestly, I'd
love to go into Q and A.

38
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,313
'Cause I think this is
the best opportunity

39
00:01:22,313 --> 00:01:24,665
for me to answer the
questions so many of you have,

40
00:01:24,665 --> 00:01:26,365
that I can't answer sometimes in a DM

41
00:01:26,365 --> 00:01:28,328
or email or things of that nature, so.

42
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:30,520
I think the thing that I
would like to talk about here

43
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,347
at ComplexCon is that I've
been here for about an hour,

44
00:01:34,347 --> 00:01:36,933
I wasn't here yesterday, and
there's three or four things

45
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:39,184
racing through my head on first taste.

46
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:42,580
Number one, holy shit,
this is exactly like

47
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,659
the baseball card shows that
I grew up in back in the day.

48
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,971
Just watching all those
kids in line for sneakers

49
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:52,692
and the other swag, trying to
get the limited edition stuff,

50
00:01:52,692 --> 00:01:54,327
flip it, make that dollar, I just,

51
00:01:54,327 --> 00:01:56,798
I mean there might not be
a more interesting show

52
00:01:56,798 --> 00:01:59,016
for me to come to, given that it's really

53
00:01:59,016 --> 00:02:02,095
so close to my true essence.

54
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:05,393
It's just 25 years later,
so that really stands out

55
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:07,778
and the entrepreneurial
vibe in that community

56
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:09,936
to me is really intriguing.

57
00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:12,940
And just watching, obviously,
the main difference is

58
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,247
this shit is a hell of a lot cooler

59
00:02:14,247 --> 00:02:16,166
than baseball cards were.

60
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,999
So watching it kind of
crash into cool culture

61
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:23,889
and collecting entrepreneurial spirit,

62
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:26,693
hustler mentality, it's just
super interesting for me.

63
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:28,398
Never, ever thought in a million years

64
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,956
that 20 year olds that
had this kind of swag

65
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:32,519
would think I was cool.

66
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,468
Never really wrapped my
head around entrepreneurship

67
00:02:34,468 --> 00:02:38,293
being put on a cultural
pedestal the way it is now.

68
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:41,420
But I've gotta be very honest,
it makes me super happy.

69
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,970
It makes me super happy that working hard

70
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,580
and trying to achieve something
for you and your family

71
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,762
is something that people now think is cool

72
00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:51,221
in the same way of being
an athlete or a rapper

73
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:52,973
or an artist of some sort so,

74
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:56,126
to me this is an incredible time.

75
00:02:56,126 --> 00:02:58,700
The internet has created
so much opportunity.

76
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,598
The fact that so many
people rolling down there,

77
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,531
coming from such humble beginnings,

78
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:05,447
and they've got a couple of
pins with their business card

79
00:03:05,447 --> 00:03:08,957
on it, or a t-shirt that
they pressed last week.

80
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:12,380
Just seeing that kind of
grind is super-inspiring

81
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,341
to be very honest with you.

82
00:03:13,341 --> 00:03:15,537
I think the thing that I trade on,

83
00:03:15,537 --> 00:03:16,878
and the thing that makes me so confident

84
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:19,748
about how this all plays out for me is

85
00:03:19,748 --> 00:03:23,915
I am far more attracted to
the idea of let's go right now

86
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:27,361
to a printing press and make some shit

87
00:03:27,361 --> 00:03:28,372
and set up a booth in the corner

88
00:03:28,372 --> 00:03:29,743
and nobody knows who the fuck we are

89
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,611
and try to sell something for 10 bucks,

90
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,490
than I am with the thought of like,

91
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,939
I didn't even go out last night, right.

92
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:39,829
Like 700 DMs of like, yo,
this club and this table

93
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,804
and this spot and these people.

94
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:46,428
And it's just so interesting
to me, like what draws me in.

95
00:03:46,428 --> 00:03:48,752
And I know that all the
stuff that I got hit up about

96
00:03:48,752 --> 00:03:51,340
last night, is what
draws a lot of people in,

97
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,272
especially the young men in the audience.

98
00:03:53,272 --> 00:03:57,751
I get it, but my hope is that
they get tricked along the way

99
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:00,249
and fall in love with the process,

100
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:02,177
not the treasures that come along with it.

101
00:04:02,177 --> 00:04:04,568
That they fall in love with
that intoxicating feeling

102
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:07,094
to wake up and feel
purposeful about something.

103
00:04:07,094 --> 00:04:09,414
That some shit that went
through their head one day,

104
00:04:09,414 --> 00:04:12,204
that motivated them, they
paste it on a t-shirt

105
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:14,228
and it got going and it took off.

106
00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:16,257
And so, I think it's an incredible time.

107
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:19,908
I think the undercurrent
of negativity in society

108
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:22,038
is feeding it even more.

109
00:04:22,038 --> 00:04:23,334
I think it's the oxygen.

110
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:26,835
I like the idea of people finally
wrapping their head around

111
00:04:26,835 --> 00:04:29,220
that nobody's gonna do it
for them, not their parents,

112
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,792
not their teachers, not
the government, nobody.

113
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:35,425
This morning I posted,
nobody owes you shit

114
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:38,015
on Instagram and just kinda
watched everybody react to it.

115
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,693
It excited me because it's
something I've been saying

116
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:42,119
on social media for 10 years.

117
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:45,756
And for the first time, the comments,

118
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:48,202
'cause you know, for all
the young kids in here

119
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:50,760
I would give you a huge piece of advice.

120
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,994
Spend a hell of a lot
less time worrying about

121
00:04:52,994 --> 00:04:56,027
how many likes and how many views you get

122
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:57,401
and start spending a
hell of a lot more time

123
00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:59,451
reading every fuckin'
word somebody replies

124
00:04:59,451 --> 00:05:01,272
to a piece of content you put out.

125
00:05:01,272 --> 00:05:02,425
And more importantly then, take the time

126
00:05:02,425 --> 00:05:04,062
to maybe engage with it,

127
00:05:04,062 --> 00:05:06,107
shit will go in the right direction.

128
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:10,172
Anyway, after 10 years on Twitter, fuck,

129
00:05:10,172 --> 00:05:12,929
let me go way back, on Myspace and Twitter

130
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:16,386
and YouTube and Facebook,
and on and on and on,

131
00:05:16,386 --> 00:05:18,453
I would honestly tell you this morning,

132
00:05:18,453 --> 00:05:21,910
the way the community responded
to nobody owes you shit

133
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,853
is probably the most excited
I've ever been because

134
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:26,997
over the last 10 years
everybody's jumping in

135
00:05:26,997 --> 00:05:28,524
and just coming up with bullshit excuses,

136
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:32,098
but yeah, but yeah, but
this guy owes me 30 bucks or

137
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,305
you know, just funny, different shit.

138
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:38,053
This was the most collective
like, I agree, fuck it.

139
00:05:38,053 --> 00:05:40,006
And that has been my calling card,

140
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,228
the reason I get to sit
here, the reason I get to

141
00:05:42,228 --> 00:05:45,275
go downstairs and have this
collaboration with K-Swiss,

142
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:48,024
or the reason I'm gonna
achieve all my goals in life,

143
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:49,926
most importantly impacting people

144
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:51,892
in a way that builds my legacy.

145
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:54,741
The good I'm trying to
give you is selfish.

146
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:57,578
Everybody's giving me love
downstairs, I'm selfish,

147
00:05:57,578 --> 00:05:59,472
I need that love.

148
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:03,283
I feed off the admiration in your eyes.

149
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:04,819
That isn't what I'm trying to achieve.

150
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:06,487
All the treasures and all the things

151
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:09,102
that come along with this,
I got that a long time ago.

152
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,381
I thought I made it
when I made a hundred K.

153
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:13,348
Hundred K a year was
my barometer at 15, 16,

154
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:14,595
I was like, when I get a hundred K.

155
00:06:14,595 --> 00:06:16,565
And I wanted to buy the
Jets, but for some reason

156
00:06:16,565 --> 00:06:19,512
a hundred K was like
(clicking tongue) right?

157
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,041
And so, we sit in an incredible time.

158
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,107
We sit in an incredible time,
and if you're sitting here

159
00:06:24,107 --> 00:06:28,014
with me right now at this
kind of event with me,

160
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:31,873
with this vibe well then you're
99% ahead of everybody else.

161
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:32,914
I mean it.

162
00:06:32,914 --> 00:06:35,722
If I could just people to
understand the perspective.

163
00:06:35,722 --> 00:06:37,811
The fact that you understand this culture,

164
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:39,104
the fact that you have that undertone

165
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:41,174
of entrepreneurship and hunger and drive,

166
00:06:41,174 --> 00:06:44,100
you're legitimately ahead of 99%.

167
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,554
The fact that this is Sunday
morning, and it's early,

168
00:06:46,554 --> 00:06:48,509
and I know we got an hour back last night,

169
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,555
but it's still fuckin' early.

170
00:06:50,555 --> 00:06:51,505
In a world where a lot of people

171
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:54,116
are just laying in bed right now, a lot.

172
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:56,848
In a world where three years
ago, you were laying in bed,

173
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:58,153
to me that's exciting.

174
00:06:58,153 --> 00:07:00,653
And so, this audience and this

175
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,991
convention center inspires me.

176
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,938
And I'm just flattered I can inspire back.

177
00:07:06,938 --> 00:07:09,496
And so, let's talk about another thing

178
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,838
and then we'll open it up for Q and A.

179
00:07:12,838 --> 00:07:14,481
You guys hear this from me
but I'm goin' keep pounding it

180
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:17,402
because I never wanna ever
let you waiver from it.

181
00:07:17,402 --> 00:07:20,152
It's just about attention, right.

182
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:23,431
Attention is the game.

183
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,589
Whatever you're trying to achieve,

184
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:29,532
if you're trying to raise
money for a non-profit,

185
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,885
if you're just trying to
help your mom out at home

186
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,307
with another hundred bucks each month,

187
00:07:33,307 --> 00:07:35,722
or if you're trying to
go for it all, right.

188
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:38,046
Yachts and planes, materialistically,

189
00:07:38,046 --> 00:07:41,487
or all-time legacy, it's
all gonna be the same game.

190
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:45,146
Can you understand where
people are paying attention?

191
00:07:45,146 --> 00:07:46,981
That is under-priced.

192
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:49,894
I understand that, you guys
understand that intuitively,

193
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:51,343
that's why you're sitting here.

194
00:07:51,343 --> 00:07:53,462
The under-priced attention in our society

195
00:07:53,462 --> 00:07:56,223
is on YouTube, it's on Snapchat,

196
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:59,350
and right now more than ever
it's on Instagram, right.

197
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,708
And so once you understand that,

198
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,259
and again, you take it for granted.

199
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:04,548
What you don't understand,
as I look at these young,

200
00:08:04,548 --> 00:08:07,656
pretty faces, is it comes
natural to you to understand

201
00:08:07,656 --> 00:08:10,224
where everybody's trading
and spending time,

202
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:12,812
but the world isn't acting on that.

203
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:16,855
My friends, if the biggest
companies in the world understood

204
00:08:16,855 --> 00:08:20,374
what was actually
happening, Nike and Adidas,

205
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,883
those fuckers downstairs,

206
00:08:21,883 --> 00:08:23,423
they'd be spending 70% of their money

207
00:08:23,423 --> 00:08:26,070
on Instagram and Snapchat and YouTube.

208
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,070
And it's not even close.

209
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:32,048
They'd be dropping product on everybody,

210
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:34,063
just for the free exposure
of your 7,000 fans

211
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:35,475
'cause it'd be worth it.

212
00:08:35,475 --> 00:08:38,667
So please do not get it
twisted, do not get confused.

213
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:41,977
You're ahead of the game
theoretically, strategically.

214
00:08:41,977 --> 00:08:44,032
Now what you gotta figure
out is two core things

215
00:08:44,032 --> 00:08:45,292
that everybody fucks up.

216
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:48,228
First of all, the shit you
put out on those places

217
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:51,615
needs to be for people, not for yourself.

218
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,910
The shit that you put
out on these platforms,

219
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,533
everybody's self-promoting,

220
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:56,944
everybody's trying to get more followers,

221
00:08:56,944 --> 00:08:58,458
everybody's trying to sell something.

222
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,254
The reason I wrote Jab,
Jab, Jab, Right Hook

223
00:09:00,254 --> 00:09:01,962
was trying to make a very
clear picture for you,

224
00:09:01,962 --> 00:09:04,966
like give, give, give, and then ask.

225
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:06,882
If you pay close attention
to who's winning,

226
00:09:06,882 --> 00:09:09,742
that doesn't have some
disproportionate advantage like

227
00:09:09,742 --> 00:09:11,373
they're already ridiculously famous

228
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:15,256
and/or they're so fucking
attractive you can't stop looking.

229
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:17,248
As long as they don't
have those two things,

230
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:19,266
if you look at everybody
else who's winning,

231
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:22,199
they're giving in their content,

232
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:24,584
they're giving in their content.

233
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:26,878
And, they understand.

234
00:09:26,878 --> 00:09:27,785
Let me give you somethin' small

235
00:09:27,785 --> 00:09:29,738
because I know you guys pay attention.

236
00:09:29,738 --> 00:09:33,107
Why did I put that red bar
at the bottom of my videos?

237
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:34,590
'Cause I'm testin' shit.

238
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,788
I'm tryin' to figure out
how to bring value, like,

239
00:09:36,788 --> 00:09:39,732
I learned, I don't know
nerdy you guys get,

240
00:09:39,732 --> 00:09:41,491
but like Medium, how
many people know Medium,

241
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:43,253
the blog post platform?

242
00:09:43,253 --> 00:09:46,144
Cool, you know what they did
that fuckin' like blew my mind?

243
00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:49,671
They told you how long
the article was to read.

244
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:51,529
This happened like three,
four years ago, right?

245
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:52,454
You've started seeing it in other places.

246
00:09:52,454 --> 00:09:54,446
I do it on my blog because of it.

247
00:09:54,446 --> 00:09:56,468
It says, three minute
read, two minute read,

248
00:09:56,468 --> 00:09:59,077
four minute read, it was crazy.

249
00:09:59,077 --> 00:10:01,449
It seems so simple but it was so valuable

250
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:04,103
because time is the most valuable thing.

251
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,020
And so I'm always tryin' new things.

252
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,803
If I can recommend anything for you,

253
00:10:07,803 --> 00:10:10,322
one thing that I've noticed is that

254
00:10:10,322 --> 00:10:13,297
everybody gets into the same
patterns with their content.

255
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:14,406
Like if you're a good photographer,

256
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,842
you're just takin' fly ass photos,

257
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:18,715
and it might be the skyline, or the beach,

258
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:20,240
or a piece of fuckin' fruit,

259
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,157
but it's the same fly ass photo, right.

260
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:24,238
If you look at my account right now,

261
00:10:24,238 --> 00:10:26,326
I'm mixing it up, it's my normal shit,

262
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,421
like the motivational shit
that I get excited about.

263
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,361
It's the video clips
that I get excited about.

264
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:33,356
But I'm tryin' to integrate
more pictures too now like,

265
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,967
you've gotta break up your
cadence 'cause you never know.

266
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:39,163
And then more importantly
within it, you need to try shit.

267
00:10:39,163 --> 00:10:41,317
And so, the red bar is just tryin' shit

268
00:10:41,317 --> 00:10:45,267
because I knew that you'd
know how long the video was.

269
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:49,439
Like meme videos, the white
borders and the white,

270
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:50,816
like I love it when I say
this and people are like,

271
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,854
oh shit, that's true,
somebody did that first.

272
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:55,835
There was some person
that's like, fuck it,

273
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:57,871
this is how I'm gonna
put out the video, right?

274
00:10:57,871 --> 00:11:00,129
Or the picture, like there is
a human that did that first.

275
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:03,967
I implore you to strive to
be more creative with your

276
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:07,431
content, and be the first to
do it this way or that way.

277
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:10,558
'Cause if god forbid, a.k.a. please god,

278
00:11:10,558 --> 00:11:13,720
if it pops, you can trade
just on that legacy.

279
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,481
Like, if I was walking
right now, it's like yo-yo,

280
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:18,297
I'm the dude that came up with the,

281
00:11:18,297 --> 00:11:20,178
yo I'm the girl that
came up with the meme.

282
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:21,829
I'd be like, oh shit,
let's hang, how'd you do,

283
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:24,901
like, it's unbelievable
and to me it all comes down

284
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:26,867
to the context of all this, which is,

285
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:28,607
this is just all culture.

286
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:30,716
And what's amazing
about culture right now,

287
00:11:30,716 --> 00:11:32,066
is it can come from any angle.

288
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,626
I'm old, at 42, growing up
with hip hop the way I did,

289
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:38,691
you had to be hard, like if you go read,

290
00:11:38,691 --> 00:11:40,722
some of you are youngsters,
you haven't read the history.

291
00:11:40,722 --> 00:11:43,364
A lot of rappers made shit
up, like that they came from

292
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:45,363
a different place than
they actually came from.

293
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:47,845
Because if you weren't like
hood, and if you weren't

294
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:50,065
fuckin' hard, you had no shot.

295
00:11:50,065 --> 00:11:52,652
Now, the fact that all of you could just

296
00:11:52,652 --> 00:11:55,412
legitimately be who you wanna be,

297
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:57,679
that's what everything fuckin' completely

298
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,678
collided into each other.

299
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:01,819
All the different cultures
that I grew up with,

300
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:04,599
and definitely the people
before me, that were separate,

301
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:08,106
all that shit is fuckin' just
colliding into each other.

302
00:12:08,106 --> 00:12:12,677
In fashion, in the music, in
the food, in the way we roll.

303
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:15,757
And that's such a positive,
that's incredible,

304
00:12:15,757 --> 00:12:18,155
what the interaction
and the intersection is.

305
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,392
And so I'm just watching it
and it's super-interesting

306
00:12:20,392 --> 00:12:23,350
to me, and I think the
biggest thing that I wanna

307
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,178
get out of this talk is to
encourage you to take chances.

308
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,747
Too many of you're playing it safe.

309
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,553
Too many of you're worried
about what other people think,

310
00:12:30,553 --> 00:12:31,617
and what people are gonna think,

311
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,040
and what your crew's gonna think.

312
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,805
And you've got ideas, like I sit here

313
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:38,263
and I look at all of you,
and I can just see the ideas.

314
00:12:38,263 --> 00:12:40,340
You got thoughts, you got ideas,

315
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,733
you have intuition of what would work.

316
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:45,819
If you're askin' me why me,
or other people have won,

317
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:48,140
it's we didn't give a fuck
what you thought about our

318
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:52,366
thoughts, we just did it, and
we fuckin' let it play out.

319
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:55,024
That's it, that is facts, man.

320
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,678
The people that break
through are the ones who

321
00:12:56,678 --> 00:12:58,124
just had a little more courage.

322
00:12:58,124 --> 00:12:59,920
They either had what I had, which is a mom

323
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,530
that fuckin' put so much self esteem in me

324
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,422
that I just can't even think
I'm not the best in the world,

325
00:13:05,422 --> 00:13:07,950
you know, I can't, she just did it.

326
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,091
Others came up a different
way, had different reasons.

327
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:12,090
Maybe you're numb, maybe you
fuckin' went the other way,

328
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,825
got beat up so much you
just fuckin' hit the bottom

329
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:18,007
and you're like fuck it, got
nothin' else to lose, right?

330
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:19,865
The video I posted yesterday on Instagram,

331
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,880
and the one that got like,
man it's like 20 million reach

332
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,683
on Facebook, where I talk about

333
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:26,786
just fuckin' fail on purpose, right.

334
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:28,771
Like watchin' all of you
guys interact with that.

335
00:13:28,771 --> 00:13:31,490
I kinda mean that, it's crazy for me that,

336
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,461
I remember, I'll tell you a
story I've never told publicly.

337
00:13:34,461 --> 00:13:37,313
I went to the White House,
Barack Obama invited seven people

338
00:13:37,313 --> 00:13:39,510
to talk about tech and communication

339
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,223
and what the fuck was goin' on.

340
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:42,801
And I remember I sat down,
I'm in the oval office

341
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:45,359
with Barack fuckin' Obama, right.

342
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:49,764
And the CMO of Amex, and Angela,
who's now the CMO of Apple,

343
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:51,864
and these gangster marketing people.

344
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:55,697
And I remember sitting
there, and I walked in,

345
00:13:56,788 --> 00:13:58,708
and I sat down, and I'm sittin' direct,

346
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,875
like I'm sittin' directly from Barack.

347
00:14:04,298 --> 00:14:05,968
Oh by the way that was the
best part, I called him Barack

348
00:14:05,968 --> 00:14:08,035
and everybody corrected me,
they're like, Mr. President.

349
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:09,129
I was like oh sorry, sorry,

350
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:12,811
thought somebody was gonna shoot me.

351
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:16,420
And actually in the slip, of
the way I called him Barack,

352
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,344
that was the only thing I
thought about on the Acela,

353
00:14:18,344 --> 00:14:20,299
on the train back to
New York the whole time,

354
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:23,046
which is, fuck it, I've
been to the tippy top

355
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:26,351
of a human being, this is the
man that runs shit, period,

356
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:28,851
the free world, I felt better.

357
00:14:30,064 --> 00:14:32,470
And so, that's what I want for everybody,

358
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,682
just that feeling where
no matter where you are,

359
00:14:34,682 --> 00:14:37,316
you just don't care, you really don't.

360
00:14:37,316 --> 00:14:38,342
And I know that's hard.

361
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:39,820
And honestly, if you ask me what I'm doin'

362
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,802
with my content right now,
I'm trying to be your shield,

363
00:14:42,802 --> 00:14:45,512
I'm trying to make you
jump, and if you fail,

364
00:14:45,512 --> 00:14:47,948
you just point to me and
be like, Gary told me.

365
00:14:47,948 --> 00:14:50,077
Like he's the reason I fucked up,

366
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:51,903
he tricked me, he's a
piece of shit, I'm sorry.

367
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,957
Like I don't care what you do,
'cause I know if you'll jump

368
00:14:54,957 --> 00:14:57,056
it's gonna feel a lot better.

369
00:14:57,056 --> 00:14:58,967
'Cause it's regret.

370
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:02,318
The reason I keep tellin' you
guys to go to a nursing home

371
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,128
is I want you to get face
to face with somebody

372
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:05,748
who's not your grandparent,

373
00:15:05,748 --> 00:15:07,958
that has regret comin' through their face.

374
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,733
And that's what's happening
in old person homes.

375
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:14,112
They have regret, telling you
right now, they have regret.

376
00:15:14,112 --> 00:15:16,625
Even if you, like I feel
already like I can go now

377
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,095
and I did good, but I'll
still have tons of regret.

378
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:20,939
I'm like what if, and this
and fuck I shoulda bought,

379
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:22,775
I could've bought the
Jets if I stayed alive.

380
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:24,923
You know like, just random shit.

381
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:28,141
I'm tryin' to get people closer to regret,

382
00:15:28,141 --> 00:15:32,011
because when regret scares
you, when you see regret,

383
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:34,977
like a horror movie, and
it shakes you to your core,

384
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:37,277
you bounce back the other
way and you start doin' shit

385
00:15:37,277 --> 00:15:39,710
because you realize how ridiculous it is

386
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,902
that you're not doing stuff

387
00:15:40,902 --> 00:15:43,649
'cause your homie might think it's stupid.

388
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:46,659
Or 'cause your older brother
had better grades than you.

389
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:49,754
Or 'cause your mom told you you
were never gonna be anybody.

390
00:15:49,754 --> 00:15:51,534
And so, that's where I'm at,

391
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,406
that's where my head space is at.

392
00:15:53,406 --> 00:15:55,780
I'm tryin' to hack attention,

393
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,950
I'm tryin' to understand
and synthesis culture.

394
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,694
But most of all, it doesn't matter

395
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:02,500
if you're wearin' a Supreme backpack,

396
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,354
or some Yeezy sneakers or this and that.

397
00:16:04,354 --> 00:16:07,770
The thing that's true is like
six, seven things in life.

398
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,019
All this other stuff is disguising.

399
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:13,927
All this other stuff is
fulfilling insecurities.

400
00:16:13,927 --> 00:16:16,018
All this other stuff is
you expressing yourself

401
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,166
to the world of who you are.

402
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,706
Most of you are wearing
everything you wear right now

403
00:16:19,706 --> 00:16:23,003
as a quick, quick interaction
with everybody else

404
00:16:23,003 --> 00:16:25,020
to try to tell everybody who you are.

405
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,986
The way you wear your hair,
man's wearin' a cap hoodie,

406
00:16:28,986 --> 00:16:31,582
right, he's tryin' to say somethin'.

407
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:32,866
That's what we're doin'.

408
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,941
And the hair that you've got, you know,

409
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:36,080
beautiful by the way.

410
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,041
And so we're trying to say
somethin' about who we are,

411
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,901
real quick, and that's why I
love and fuck with fashion.

412
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,119
Not like, I don't love fashion,

413
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:46,509
but I love what it does for us.

414
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:48,255
It helps those of you

415
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:51,447
who don't communicate
like I do, communicate.

416
00:16:51,447 --> 00:16:53,967
I just wanna make sure you're
usin' it to communicate,

417
00:16:53,967 --> 00:16:55,550
not close some insecurities that you have

418
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,775
and you wanna fit in.

419
00:16:56,775 --> 00:16:59,552
And that's what I love so much
about what's happening now,

420
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,634
is it feels like blank canvas.

421
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:04,347
Feels like, you know
what's crazy right now,

422
00:17:04,347 --> 00:17:06,627
is if you've got any kind of audience

423
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:08,469
and you got just a
little bit of confidence,

424
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,303
you could do anything.

425
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,180
If you take the hundred people

426
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,834
that have the most confidence downstairs,

427
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:18,309
if they walk here with
an umbrella as a hat,

428
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:19,775
in the first 10 minutes,
everybody'd be like,

429
00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:21,526
what the fuck, and an hour
later people are like,

430
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:24,384
yeah where do I get that umbrella?

431
00:17:24,384 --> 00:17:26,648
And I'm fascinated by that.

432
00:17:26,648 --> 00:17:29,155
And I implore you to
get into that mindset.

433
00:17:29,155 --> 00:17:31,912
And so, I feel like anybody's
who's sitting here right now

434
00:17:31,912 --> 00:17:35,653
is fuckin' with me, and I hope
you understand why you are.

435
00:17:35,653 --> 00:17:39,976
Because, this is a great era,
especially for the subculture

436
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,886
that's sitting here,
there's a lot of minorities,

437
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:45,121
brown and black and girls
and I mean minorities

438
00:17:45,121 --> 00:17:47,999
of not white male, which I am one of.

439
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:49,498
This is the greatest era,
'cause the internet's

440
00:17:49,498 --> 00:17:50,847
the middleman and nobody stop,

441
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,817
why the fuck do you think Harvey Weinstein

442
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:55,724
and Kevin Spacey are gettin' taken down?

443
00:17:55,724 --> 00:17:59,347
By the way, if you're a bad
person, and you're 60 years old,

444
00:17:59,347 --> 00:18:01,813
you're shittin' your pants right now.

445
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:04,583
'Cause you're fuckin' next.

446
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,105
And do you know how happy I am about this?

447
00:18:07,105 --> 00:18:08,756
Do you know how happy I am?

448
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:10,841
Do you know how happy I am
that the girl sittin' third row

449
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:12,690
in the middle, Kate Franklin,
somebody who worked for me

450
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:13,523
for a short period of time,

451
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:15,707
that I know every
interaction I had with her,

452
00:18:15,707 --> 00:18:17,420
I know what she says behind my back,

453
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,918
I know why we're gonna meet
in an hour and talk again.

454
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:22,188
Doing the right thing is
always the right thing,

455
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:25,388
and this is finally the era
where that's gonna play out.

456
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:29,525
Because 20, 50 people used
to be able to hide shit.

457
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:33,894
And so it's about to get
much better or much worse,

458
00:18:33,894 --> 00:18:37,046
depending on how you
decide to live your life.

459
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:39,011
And so, if you go read my first two books,

460
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:42,104
Crush It, and Thank You
Economy, very subtly

461
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:43,946
and very specifically I'm telling people

462
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:46,979
the shadows of our society
are about to change.

463
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:50,315
That I changed when I
learned social media,

464
00:18:50,315 --> 00:18:53,213
when I, in my head, when I was like, fuck,

465
00:18:53,213 --> 00:18:56,628
everybody's gonna know
everything about everything.

466
00:18:56,628 --> 00:18:58,563
And so, since 2008, I've
just been livin' a different

467
00:18:58,563 --> 00:19:01,256
kind of life, got you
know, and I just like it.

468
00:19:01,256 --> 00:19:03,326
I think the only way to
survive and really win

469
00:19:03,326 --> 00:19:06,548
is gonna be on good and
positivity and that's crazy.

470
00:19:06,548 --> 00:19:08,214
That's super exciting.

471
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:10,981
And so I implore you to know one thing,

472
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:14,290
you know, I laugh when people
like, some of you I just met

473
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,586
and some of you I met on, you know,

474
00:19:15,586 --> 00:19:18,060
I laugh when I leave a situation,

475
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,140
quick selfie, quick hello, quick love.

476
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,485
And I walk, and I know what's happening,

477
00:19:24,485 --> 00:19:25,705
nine out of 10 times they're like,

478
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:27,153
oh man thank god he's as nice in person,

479
00:19:27,153 --> 00:19:30,117
I was hoping he wouldn't suck.

480
00:19:30,117 --> 00:19:32,455
It's always good, and I laugh because

481
00:19:32,455 --> 00:19:36,017
I find it funny that
we've become so cynical

482
00:19:36,017 --> 00:19:37,164
because of the world we've lived in

483
00:19:37,164 --> 00:19:38,620
for the last hundred years,

484
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,322
that being nice or doing the right thing

485
00:19:41,322 --> 00:19:43,322
is the positive outcome,

486
00:19:44,423 --> 00:19:47,084
right, that it's not the expected.

487
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:48,144
That we're protecting ourselves

488
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:49,683
'cause we don't wanna be let down.

489
00:19:49,683 --> 00:19:52,188
That even there's a saying,

490
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:53,524
like you don't wanna meet your hero.

491
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:55,824
It's like, it's so sad, and I don't think

492
00:19:55,824 --> 00:19:57,394
that's gonna play out
the next hundred years

493
00:19:57,394 --> 00:20:01,561
and so, most of you are very
young in your game, right?

494
00:20:02,658 --> 00:20:04,884
You're thinking and your
aspiring in your brain

495
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:07,510
the way I did when I was in this audience

496
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,561
of where you're gonna be,
but it's still five, seven,

497
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:12,644
15, 20 years away, right?

498
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:15,722
I just wanna make sure that you realize

499
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:18,748
the quickest way, 'cause
everybody wants to get here quick,

500
00:20:18,748 --> 00:20:20,498
it's always patience.

501
00:20:20,498 --> 00:20:22,565
The quickest way to guarantee you'll get

502
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:24,573
to wherever you wanna get to,

503
00:20:24,573 --> 00:20:26,918
is by treating every single
person you interact with

504
00:20:26,918 --> 00:20:28,418
with serious love.

505
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,396
'Cause they will build
you, they will build you,

506
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,555
they will put you on your back.

507
00:20:33,555 --> 00:20:35,803
And they're also the people
that will fucking tear you down

508
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:39,970
behind, you think somebody
who's in power, in charge,

509
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,882
who's got some juice, is
the one that you need to be

510
00:20:42,882 --> 00:20:47,049
pandering too, those people
aren't doing' anything for you.

511
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,756
It's the people that you're
sitting next to right now.

512
00:20:50,756 --> 00:20:53,667
Kindness is gonna be the currency

513
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:57,596
and that is where we're goin'
and it's fuckin' beautiful.

514
00:20:57,596 --> 00:20:59,212
Like, it's real good.

515
00:20:59,212 --> 00:21:01,453
Everybody thinks shit's bad now.

516
00:21:01,453 --> 00:21:04,560
Let me just tell all of you
what's happening in culture

517
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,585
where we're spreading apart
and we're in an almost

518
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:09,045
intellectual civil war and
everything that's going on.

519
00:21:09,045 --> 00:21:10,502
Let me tell you what's going on.

520
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,380
And remember that I said it.

521
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,302
This is just one step
backwards, two steps forward.

522
00:21:15,302 --> 00:21:18,380
We needed to get exposed
because we were hiding

523
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,812
under the makeup of the
old media landscape.

524
00:21:21,812 --> 00:21:23,435
We needed to just come to grips

525
00:21:23,435 --> 00:21:26,116
that we still got some
shit to get through.

526
00:21:26,116 --> 00:21:30,982
And now that it is on, like
we're in it, the lights are on

527
00:21:30,982 --> 00:21:34,232
our differences, the lights
are on our shortcomings,

528
00:21:34,232 --> 00:21:37,282
I'm happy, 'cause the way you go forward

529
00:21:37,282 --> 00:21:40,816
is acknowledging and respecting
what the fuck is fucked up.

530
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:43,389
And so, I'm very optimistic.

531
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:46,332
I think the next five to
ten years are gonna suck,

532
00:21:46,332 --> 00:21:48,171
the way it feels like it's sucking now.

533
00:21:48,171 --> 00:21:50,022
I still don't think it's really sucking,

534
00:21:50,022 --> 00:21:52,528
'cause you're in control,
you can dwell on what

535
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:56,596
you can't control, or you
can focus on what you can.

536
00:21:56,596 --> 00:21:59,559
And so, I'm real excited,
I'm real excited.

537
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:02,523
I'm really grateful that
you guys are spendin'

538
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:04,409
45 minutes of your time, with everything

539
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:07,178
that's goin' on downstairs,
here with me so, thank you

540
00:22:07,178 --> 00:22:08,551
and I appreciate you.

541
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:11,718
(audience applauding)

542
00:22:13,592 --> 00:22:16,303
So look, I went super
heady and like up here

543
00:22:16,303 --> 00:22:17,765
and emotional and like, up here.

544
00:22:17,765 --> 00:22:19,827
But, while we've got this 25 minutes,

545
00:22:19,827 --> 00:22:21,930
this is the time to get selfish as fuck

546
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,445
and let's go real down here, like a.k.a,

547
00:22:24,445 --> 00:22:27,265
yo, how do I sell hats on LinkedIn?

548
00:22:27,265 --> 00:22:28,792
(audience laughing)

549
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:30,060
All right, my man.

550
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,708
- [Man With Backwards Cap]
Gary, first of all thank you.

551
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:34,131
I'm an up and coming rapper
so I might freestyle,

552
00:22:34,131 --> 00:22:36,821
'cause fuck it, you said
you're all on the Gary V show.

553
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:39,400
My name's Zach, I turned
20 on the 20th of November,

554
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,636
I'm a Scorpio, here's the deal, you say

555
00:22:41,636 --> 00:22:44,486
drop a song every day for 365 days but,

556
00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:46,727
I'm like wait, there's no
way that can have quality.

557
00:22:46,727 --> 00:22:48,515
'Cause it's quality over
quantity, but honestly

558
00:22:48,515 --> 00:22:50,314
I'm astonishing the reality that way.

559
00:22:50,314 --> 00:22:52,039
Let me slow down a bit,
'cause my heart is beating--

560
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:52,872
(Gary laughing)

561
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,450
Honestly I might crash, but it's okay

562
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,963
'cause you say fuck it,
fail on purpose, I'm back.

563
00:22:56,963 --> 00:22:57,861
'Cause I got a purpose.

564
00:22:57,861 --> 00:22:59,483
A lot these people, no one's worthless,

565
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:01,201
and no one's worth less than anyone else.

566
00:23:01,201 --> 00:23:02,683
Not trying to inspire, but let me inquire

567
00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:04,144
the knowledge from you real quick.

568
00:23:04,144 --> 00:23:05,242
This is off the top.

569
00:23:05,242 --> 00:23:07,709
Anyway back to the top pick,
I hope I'm in your top picks

570
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:09,353
when you think about your vlog shit.

571
00:23:09,353 --> 00:23:12,568
I hope my song on that,
it's D-Co on SoundCloud,

572
00:23:12,568 --> 00:23:14,108
you should search that, hit this,

573
00:23:14,108 --> 00:23:15,446
anyway, here's the question.

574
00:23:15,446 --> 00:23:17,364
- Ah-ha, good job, man. (clapping)

575
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:19,711
(audience applauding)

576
00:23:19,711 --> 00:23:22,419
- [Man With Backwards Cap] You
say upload a song 365 days--

577
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:24,879
- And I think I clarified it
in one of the last sessions,

578
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:27,397
where I was like, look, oh
actually we haven't put it out.

579
00:23:27,397 --> 00:23:30,760
It was the one with Big Cred, right?

580
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,782
It's, if you've got it like
that, put it out like that.

581
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:37,171
My big thing is that
Michael Jackson and Prince,

582
00:23:37,171 --> 00:23:40,254
sat on hundreds of songs we haven't heard.

583
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:43,140
And so, to your point, quality, quantity,

584
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,117
look what I'm going,
I'm putting out fucking

585
00:23:45,117 --> 00:23:47,117
a ton of shit every day.

586
00:23:48,655 --> 00:23:50,905
And, I have a good feeling,

587
00:23:51,821 --> 00:23:56,045
'cause I'm lookin' at it every
day that it's quality, right?

588
00:23:56,045 --> 00:23:59,433
And so, if you can put
out 113 songs, do that.

589
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:01,494
And if you can put out 365, do that.

590
00:24:01,494 --> 00:24:03,380
Because these are at bats.

591
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,559
Music's interesting, music's like content.

592
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:07,524
You're literally one song away.

593
00:24:07,524 --> 00:24:09,154
My man, you're literally,

594
00:24:09,154 --> 00:24:10,630
like I need you to
really wrap your fuckin'

595
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,323
head around what I'm about to tell you.

596
00:24:12,323 --> 00:24:16,490
15 years ago, you had to get
found, you had to get signed,

597
00:24:17,741 --> 00:24:18,775
you had to get through the,

598
00:24:18,775 --> 00:24:22,029
you know when I talk about
this, a lot artists came in,

599
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:24,271
I made a reference to
like, you had to get found

600
00:24:24,271 --> 00:24:25,982
by L.A. Reed and then
put on, and some girl

601
00:24:25,982 --> 00:24:27,980
jumped in the comments
on Insta, she's like,

602
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,204
and even that doesn't happen.

603
00:24:29,204 --> 00:24:31,686
She's like I was signed
by L.A. fuckin' Reed

604
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:32,962
and I got caught up in the system

605
00:24:32,962 --> 00:24:35,249
and my shit never even came out.

606
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:39,286
So 20 years ago man, you
had no fuckin' chance.

607
00:24:39,286 --> 00:24:42,614
It was fuckin' .000, it was ridiculous.

608
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:45,215
Now you, you, can put
something on SoundCloud

609
00:24:45,215 --> 00:24:48,869
or Spotify tomorrow, and
it just might be the song.

610
00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:51,526
So yeah, I want you to put
out as much as you've got.

611
00:24:51,526 --> 00:24:53,515
And if you only got six good songs in you,

612
00:24:53,515 --> 00:24:56,258
then you're not gonna have
a career anyway, right?

613
00:24:56,258 --> 00:24:58,801
And so, or, maybe I'm
wrong, you know actually

614
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:00,679
as I said it, I'm takin' a step back.

615
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:03,727
One great song is a lot
of people's entire career.

616
00:25:03,727 --> 00:25:08,677
Right, right, so (laughing)
let's not call people out.

617
00:25:08,677 --> 00:25:12,844
And so, yeah man, I just want
you putting out stuff, right.

618
00:25:14,224 --> 00:25:17,505
When I was in Mount Ida
College, battle rap was real hot

619
00:25:17,505 --> 00:25:20,044
and people used to really
go up against each other.

620
00:25:20,044 --> 00:25:21,478
And some of the shit that I heard

621
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,098
is like the coolest best shit I ever heard

622
00:25:23,098 --> 00:25:24,558
and a week later I'd talk to 'em

623
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:27,194
and they don't even
remember what they said

624
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:29,620
'cause they weren't writing
and then battling bullshit

625
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,086
they were like really
doin' it from the top.

626
00:25:33,086 --> 00:25:34,707
That's why I have DRock
man, some of the best,

627
00:25:34,707 --> 00:25:36,585
you know that fuckin'
video with that little kid

628
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:39,094
in the liquor store, where I
told him not to worry about

629
00:25:39,094 --> 00:25:41,012
YouTube views, that got so many views?

630
00:25:41,012 --> 00:25:44,657
That would've been lost in
fuckin' space back in the day,

631
00:25:44,657 --> 00:25:47,085
back in my day two years ago,
that woulda been lost in space

632
00:25:47,085 --> 00:25:49,748
but now that I have them filming, right?

633
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,890
So yeah man I think, I
think the quality quantity

634
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,092
conversation was for a day and age

635
00:25:55,092 --> 00:25:57,113
where distribution was different.

636
00:25:57,113 --> 00:26:00,799
It's true, but as many
at bats as you can get

637
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,399
because what is crazy is one song.

638
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:06,201
And sometimes it comes early.

639
00:26:06,201 --> 00:26:09,357
Lil Yatchy just, it happened fast, right.

640
00:26:09,357 --> 00:26:11,636
His one song happened quick.

641
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:15,039
You know, Kylie fuckin' Sa, you know or

642
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,184
one person puts it on, you know?

643
00:26:18,184 --> 00:26:19,085
- [Man In Backwards Cap] Thank you.

644
00:26:19,085 --> 00:26:20,505
- You got it.

645
00:26:20,505 --> 00:26:21,356
My man.

646
00:26:21,356 --> 00:26:23,997
- Hey Gary, Harry Duran,
host of Podcast Junkies.

647
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:26,292
I have two pieces of
gratitude and a question.

648
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:28,089
The first is, I don't
know if you remember,

649
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:30,190
oh first, thank you for
gettin' me in here for free--

650
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,094
- [Gary] No worries.

651
00:26:31,094 --> 00:26:34,706
- 'Cause this is on you and
your text message, that worked.

652
00:26:34,706 --> 00:26:35,634
- [Gary] Go figure.

653
00:26:35,634 --> 00:26:37,269
- I don't know if you remember
C.J. Boling from VidSummit--

654
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:38,102
- [Gary] Of course.

655
00:26:38,102 --> 00:26:38,935
- I just wanted to give
you a quick update.

656
00:26:38,935 --> 00:26:41,637
He was at 30 followers on
YouTube, he's at 10,000 now.

657
00:26:41,637 --> 00:26:42,988
And I just saw it yesterday, so kudos

658
00:26:42,988 --> 00:26:44,754
to that again.
- That's incredible.

659
00:26:44,754 --> 00:26:47,727
- The question is, I'm
more interested rather than

660
00:26:47,727 --> 00:26:50,418
a tip or a tactic, to
understand what you OS is like,

661
00:26:50,418 --> 00:26:53,280
so what's something you've
changed your mind about recently?

662
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,134
- That's a great question.

663
00:26:55,134 --> 00:26:57,550
What have I, god, you know it's funny

664
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:02,490
'cause I'm narrow and deep,
changed by mind, changed my mind

665
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,434
I don't have a quick
answer, but I'll tell you

666
00:27:04,434 --> 00:27:06,873
the best thing that I've
changed my mind about,

667
00:27:06,873 --> 00:27:10,429
which I guess I changed my mind
but it was more my actions.

668
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:13,565
I've become much better at radical candor

669
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,937
at VaynerMedia, I'm so positive,

670
00:27:15,937 --> 00:27:20,549
and I love honey over
vinegar, that I think at times

671
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:23,013
the second time there
was conflict or issue,

672
00:27:23,013 --> 00:27:25,250
where I decided to deploy more optimism,

673
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,882
and more honey and more
sunshine, and hoped

674
00:27:27,882 --> 00:27:30,878
when they went back out of
my office into the company,

675
00:27:30,878 --> 00:27:34,318
or my audience, I think that
I'm starting to do a better job

676
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:36,816
of speeding up the process where I'm like,

677
00:27:36,816 --> 00:27:38,592
look, you're fucking up
and you're gonna get fired

678
00:27:38,592 --> 00:27:40,501
and let me tell you what to do.

679
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:42,592
Instead of making that
the fourth conversation,

680
00:27:42,592 --> 00:27:45,822
it's now starting to be closer
to the 2.5 conversation.

681
00:27:45,822 --> 00:27:46,655
And I've gotta be honest with you,

682
00:27:46,655 --> 00:27:50,039
I've felt the very positive
ramifications of that

683
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:53,325
and it's taken me from positive and good

684
00:27:53,325 --> 00:27:55,500
and a little closer to
shooting it straight.

685
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,174
You know, I talk about my
dad, that was more about

686
00:27:58,174 --> 00:28:00,421
my actions and not stealing
and not doing the wrong thing

687
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:02,490
and not bullshitting, but
I think I'm going through

688
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,286
a weird version, because
Vayner's getting big

689
00:28:04,286 --> 00:28:06,543
and I have almost a
thousand employees now,

690
00:28:06,543 --> 00:28:09,297
and I've seen some of the things
I don't like about Vayner,

691
00:28:09,297 --> 00:28:11,858
face to face, and it's on me.

692
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:13,703
The think I've changed my mind about is,

693
00:28:13,703 --> 00:28:16,435
when I think about the honey
empire, and honey over vinegar

694
00:28:16,435 --> 00:28:18,637
I used to say, honey over vinegar,

695
00:28:18,637 --> 00:28:21,162
but I think in my actions
I was honey, honey, honey,

696
00:28:21,162 --> 00:28:23,931
honey, honey over vinegar, or even worse,

697
00:28:23,931 --> 00:28:26,032
the thing I'm most fearful
of, honey, honey, honey,

698
00:28:26,032 --> 00:28:27,727
honey, honey, you're fired.

699
00:28:27,727 --> 00:28:29,166
And if you were the kind
of person that wasn't

700
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,183
self-aware, if you didn't hear the vinegar

701
00:28:31,183 --> 00:28:33,492
even though I was trying to tell you

702
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:35,538
in every piece of honey,
like, you're fucking up,

703
00:28:35,538 --> 00:28:37,681
shit's not right, it still felt like

704
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:40,307
I fuckin' pulled the rug
out from underneath you.

705
00:28:40,307 --> 00:28:44,923
So I would say the
adoptance of radical candor

706
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:48,367
in the mix of my tool belt,
in my Swiss army knife,

707
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:50,563
is taking me to the next level.

708
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:52,183
- [Harry] And I imagine they
appreciate you more in the end

709
00:28:52,183 --> 00:28:53,238
'cause you were honest with them.

710
00:28:53,238 --> 00:28:56,468
- You know, it's funny, a certain group,

711
00:28:56,468 --> 00:29:00,370
that 25% that was my
vulnerability, no question

712
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,709
is probably gonna appreciate it more.

713
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:05,203
And at least, if nothing
else, they're not stunned.

714
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:06,108
Even though for me it was like,

715
00:29:06,108 --> 00:29:08,521
how did you not see it in the nuances.

716
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:09,904
Now it's just more black and white.

717
00:29:09,904 --> 00:29:11,817
So adopting a little more black and white.

718
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:12,720
- [Harry] Thank you.

719
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,803
- You got it.

720
00:29:15,372 --> 00:29:17,360
- Gary, what's up man,
Ivan, good to see you again.

721
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,319
- [Gary] Great to see you, Ivan.

722
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:21,992
- So, my wife and I just started
running a YouTube channel,

723
00:29:21,992 --> 00:29:23,495
it's probably not for
the demographic here,

724
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,858
it's ballet videos for young children,

725
00:29:25,858 --> 00:29:27,457
so it appeals to parents
and stuff like that.

726
00:29:27,457 --> 00:29:28,559
- [Gary] Don't sleep on people's ballet

727
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,004
obsessions up in here.

728
00:29:31,004 --> 00:29:33,313
- So, we produce video,
they're expensive to make

729
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,167
but that's not an issue,
we're giving content,

730
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:36,012
giving content--

731
00:29:36,012 --> 00:29:37,590
- [Gary] Why are they expensive to make?

732
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:41,275
- Just costing to rent out
studio, editors, green screen,

733
00:29:41,275 --> 00:29:44,488
makin' it look professional,
all that stuff.

734
00:29:44,488 --> 00:29:47,040
- One thing I'm gonna press
on is just give thought,

735
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,587
if you're going too professional

736
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:50,539
given the reality of where you're at.

737
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,200
- So, the money thing isn't an issue,

738
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,526
you know, it's fine--
- Okay, respect.

739
00:29:55,526 --> 00:29:57,337
- So we're givin' out
content all the time,

740
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,594
we're not sure, we've thought about

741
00:29:58,594 --> 00:30:01,321
either reaching out to brands
and getting sponsorships,

742
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:03,523
you know, tactic like the Backpack Kid.

743
00:30:03,523 --> 00:30:05,220
We thought about hey, do we create our own

744
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,797
ballet shoe and sell merchandise?

745
00:30:07,797 --> 00:30:09,653
What if we're not sure, we're giving,

746
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:13,128
we're not sure what the ask
is, or if there even is an ask?

747
00:30:13,128 --> 00:30:16,183
- I mean I think you're in the
best fuckin' spot ever then.

748
00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:19,334
To me, I never thought,
I'm a business man,

749
00:30:19,334 --> 00:30:23,439
I'm and entrepreneur, so I
never thought a K-Swiss sneaker

750
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:25,189
was gonna be the ask.

751
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:30,015
To me, it came, things come to me.

752
00:30:31,321 --> 00:30:33,586
So, I think that if you're in a place

753
00:30:33,586 --> 00:30:37,369
where you're not sure, then
I wouldn't stress yourself

754
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,381
of coming up with one,
'cause if you force it,

755
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:40,703
it's gonna fail.

756
00:30:40,703 --> 00:30:41,926
It's not gonna come natural from you,

757
00:30:41,926 --> 00:30:43,184
they're gonna feel it's not natural,

758
00:30:43,184 --> 00:30:44,681
and it's just gonna break.

759
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:46,718
I would just tell you to
keep building leverage

760
00:30:46,718 --> 00:30:49,569
and attention, because
when you wanna deploy it,

761
00:30:49,569 --> 00:30:51,389
I mean this whole thing,
like yeah, I've got a sneaker

762
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:53,208
and I've got a book, but
these are inexpensive things

763
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:56,672
along the way, in return
for what I'm giving.

764
00:30:56,672 --> 00:30:58,770
I don't wanna ask at all,

765
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,106
so that I can ask for my final ask,

766
00:31:01,106 --> 00:31:02,889
which is, if the Jets go up for sale

767
00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:05,094
and I come up a couple dollars short,

768
00:31:05,094 --> 00:31:07,425
I think I'm gonna
crowdfund it from the world

769
00:31:07,425 --> 00:31:10,555
and close the gap, right, and so,

770
00:31:10,555 --> 00:31:13,643
I don't think you have to
force yourself into an ask.

771
00:31:13,643 --> 00:31:17,476
And, I think you need
to stay curious and open

772
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:21,158
to see if it comes to
you, but I don't think

773
00:31:21,158 --> 00:31:23,279
you have to force it if you can afford to.

774
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,609
And if you get to a place
where you can't afford to,

775
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:28,816
give yourself six good months,
and that might be right now,

776
00:31:28,816 --> 00:31:30,867
if you feel like, okay, in
six months we're gonna be

777
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:33,864
forced to doing something, and
start being real thoughtful

778
00:31:33,864 --> 00:31:36,747
but it's much better if
it comes naturally to you.

779
00:31:36,747 --> 00:31:38,568
- Cool, I like the six month
thing and that's very practical

780
00:31:38,568 --> 00:31:41,199
and yeah, like you said,
we don't wanna do a,

781
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,621
we can easily do like a
one ninety-nine per month

782
00:31:43,621 --> 00:31:47,315
subscription, but I feel
like those are just so,

783
00:31:47,315 --> 00:31:48,787
everyone's doin' it and
we don't wanna just be

784
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:49,776
those type of people.
- Let me tell you something

785
00:31:49,776 --> 00:31:52,688
right now, and for all of you.

786
00:31:52,688 --> 00:31:54,515
You will never succeed
if you sell something

787
00:31:54,515 --> 00:31:56,816
you don't believe in.

788
00:31:56,816 --> 00:31:58,507
So many of you are selling something

789
00:31:58,507 --> 00:32:01,759
because it seems like
it's the thing that sells.

790
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:03,259
And you will lose.

791
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:07,717
100%, to stand by your product,
you got to love it first.

792
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:11,610
So I get that hoodies, right,
and beanies, and sneakers,

793
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:15,270
and backpacks feel right now,
but if you love your shit,

794
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:18,187
it will come to you in three years.

795
00:32:20,695 --> 00:32:22,320
Nobody was wearin' socks
that had cool shit on it

796
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,153
five years ago, right.

797
00:32:25,414 --> 00:32:28,785
So if you really believe
in it and you love it,

798
00:32:28,785 --> 00:32:29,618
it will come to you.

799
00:32:29,618 --> 00:32:33,327
And things go up and down,
things go up and down.

800
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:34,681
Yeah, don't force it.

801
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:35,637
- Thank you.
- But, if you know

802
00:32:35,637 --> 00:32:37,781
you need it in six months,
and I saw how you reacted,

803
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:39,691
start gettin' curious
and start really gettin'

804
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,273
deep in ballet culture,
and maybe in the depths

805
00:32:42,273 --> 00:32:45,049
of ballet culture, on some small hashtag,

806
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:46,944
you see somebody doin' somethin' fly,

807
00:32:46,944 --> 00:32:48,202
and you're like okay, that's gonna emerge.

808
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:49,741
Maybe you DM them, you
wanna do it together,

809
00:32:49,741 --> 00:32:50,695
or maybe you're inspired by it

810
00:32:50,695 --> 00:32:53,581
and DJ your own version of it, cool.

811
00:32:53,581 --> 00:32:55,056
- [Ivan] Can I get a
right hook real quick?

812
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:55,889
- Um-hm.

813
00:32:55,889 --> 00:32:57,176
- For those with young children out there,

814
00:32:57,176 --> 00:32:58,613
Buttercup Ballet on YouTube.

815
00:32:58,613 --> 00:32:59,446
- [Gary] Good for you.

816
00:32:59,446 --> 00:33:00,279
- Thanks, Gary.

817
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,708
- [Gary] You got it.

818
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:03,055
- [Man] Hey guys, just real
quick, I have to be this guy

819
00:33:03,055 --> 00:33:04,610
but we have time for five more questions

820
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,347
if we make 'em quick, please.

821
00:33:06,347 --> 00:33:07,552
- You got it, and if you're in line,

822
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:10,614
I'll try to make six
if I go real quick, go.

823
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:11,882
- I'll be quick, yo what's up.

824
00:33:11,882 --> 00:33:14,348
G, bless up, you're an amazing person.

825
00:33:14,348 --> 00:33:15,181
- Thank you.
- I met you back at

826
00:33:15,181 --> 00:33:18,046
Shoe Palace, that was
an amazing day because

827
00:33:18,046 --> 00:33:19,665
when I looked at the
vlog after you posted it

828
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:21,251
I was like skimmin'
through, skimmin' through,

829
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:23,533
about like 18 minutes of
that shit was just like,

830
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:25,825
not Shoe Palace, and then
it gets to Shoe Palace

831
00:33:25,825 --> 00:33:28,775
and, I was the guy that
you put the clip in,

832
00:33:28,775 --> 00:33:30,023
it was the only clip.
- I love it.

833
00:33:30,023 --> 00:33:32,664
- And it's so funny, 'cause
I was at an event of Friday

834
00:33:32,664 --> 00:33:34,821
supporting a friend and
some random person was like,

835
00:33:34,821 --> 00:33:37,584
yo, Gary V posted a video with you,

836
00:33:37,584 --> 00:33:39,882
and I thought that was
like the craziest thing.

837
00:33:39,882 --> 00:33:41,498
I don't have a specific
question to ask you

838
00:33:41,498 --> 00:33:43,282
because you give out so much free content.

839
00:33:43,282 --> 00:33:45,222
I just take it and I apply it and I do

840
00:33:45,222 --> 00:33:46,663
trial and error in everything.

841
00:33:46,663 --> 00:33:48,705
What I do have to ask you though is,

842
00:33:48,705 --> 00:33:50,844
I wanna challenge you
to rock, paper, scissors

843
00:33:50,844 --> 00:33:52,987
and if I beat you, we have a sit down.

844
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:56,511
- Okay so, I've only
done this one other time

845
00:33:56,511 --> 00:34:00,503
and it was with Jerome Jarre
and he won 'cause he cheated.

846
00:34:00,503 --> 00:34:01,809
Are you good at cheating too?

847
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:02,642
- I'm good at winning.
- Tell the truth.

848
00:34:02,642 --> 00:34:04,215
- [Man Asking Question]
I'm good at winning.

849
00:34:04,215 --> 00:34:05,718
- But are you good at it
because you kind of like

850
00:34:05,718 --> 00:34:07,212
actually like practice
rock, paper, scissors

851
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,045
and you know what's gonna happen?

852
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:09,411
- My girl and I always
play rock, paper, scissors

853
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:11,842
for who pays, and normally--

854
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:13,002
- [Gary] You make your girl pay for shit?

855
00:34:13,003 --> 00:34:14,744
- No, wait, wait, no--

856
00:34:14,744 --> 00:34:15,951
- What the fuck?
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,

857
00:34:15,951 --> 00:34:17,483
wait, wait, nah, nah--

858
00:34:17,483 --> 00:34:19,299
- I'm kidding.
- She a hustler.

859
00:34:19,299 --> 00:34:20,266
- Respect.
- She a hustler.

860
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,150
She's independent, she don't need--

861
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,406
- Respect, I get it, whatever she wants.

862
00:34:22,406 --> 00:34:23,239
- Yeah.

863
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,143
- [Gary] All right, yeah, let's do it.

864
00:34:24,143 --> 00:34:24,976
- Cool.

865
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:26,617
- All right, what does it
go, one, two, three, shoot?

866
00:34:26,617 --> 00:34:27,549
- Yeah, two out of three.

867
00:34:27,549 --> 00:34:28,382
- No, no, one.

868
00:34:28,382 --> 00:34:29,215
- Straight up?

869
00:34:29,215 --> 00:34:30,047
- Yeah.
(muffled)

870
00:34:30,047 --> 00:34:30,975
This dude came here, he
was like, I'm gonna take

871
00:34:30,976 --> 00:34:32,534
a lot of time, now we're doin' this shit,

872
00:34:32,534 --> 00:34:33,367
then he wants--

873
00:34:33,368 --> 00:34:34,201
(audience laughing)

874
00:34:34,201 --> 00:34:36,054
then he wants, right, right my man, right?

875
00:34:36,054 --> 00:34:37,187
Then he want two out of fuckin' three.

876
00:34:37,188 --> 00:34:38,699
Why not a seven game series?

877
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:39,989
One time, ready?

878
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:41,300
Is it, well I wanna make sure, so one--

879
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:42,319
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

880
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:45,056
- Rock, papers, scissors,
then shoot, got it.

881
00:34:45,056 --> 00:34:46,937
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

882
00:34:46,938 --> 00:34:48,797
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

883
00:34:48,797 --> 00:34:49,630
You got it.

884
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,457
(audience applauding)

885
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:53,311
- Who do I need to talk to?

886
00:34:53,311 --> 00:34:55,045
- Gary at VaynerMedia.

887
00:34:55,045 --> 00:34:56,509
- Well I've been tryin' that, I need a--

888
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,623
- You're gonna say I beat
you in rock, paper, scissors.

889
00:34:58,623 --> 00:34:59,552
(audience laughing)

890
00:34:59,552 --> 00:35:03,617
And I'm gonna fuckin'
have a meeting with you.

891
00:35:03,617 --> 00:35:05,083
Let's go.

892
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:08,034
- What's up Zeus, my name's
Zeus, from Shadow Group.

893
00:35:08,034 --> 00:35:08,867
- [Gary] Nice to meet you.

894
00:35:08,867 --> 00:35:11,114
- I just started a
YouTube, zero subscribers--

895
00:35:11,114 --> 00:35:12,014
- [Gary] Good.

896
00:35:12,014 --> 00:35:13,020
- Real proud of that, that I just started.

897
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,592
- [Gary] I'm proud of you too, man.

898
00:35:14,592 --> 00:35:17,721
- Yeah, and I honestly wanted to get,

899
00:35:17,721 --> 00:35:19,321
I'm trying to build up
my Instagram as well

900
00:35:19,321 --> 00:35:22,532
and I would like to get an
audit, an Instagram audit

901
00:35:22,532 --> 00:35:25,659
from you, and maybe just you
DM me and see what you think

902
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:27,982
I can do, or what you think I should do.

903
00:35:27,982 --> 00:35:29,135
- [Gary] Okay, Andy's gonna do it for you,

904
00:35:29,135 --> 00:35:30,208
'cause he's smarter than me.

905
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:31,160
- All right.

906
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,993
- [Gary] Done.

907
00:35:31,993 --> 00:35:35,221
- I kinda wanna play him
paper, rock, scissors,

908
00:35:35,221 --> 00:35:36,888
just to take his spot.

909
00:35:36,888 --> 00:35:39,183
- Well you can see if he gives up his spot

910
00:35:39,183 --> 00:35:41,758
but I'm gonna move Zeus, appreciate it.

911
00:35:41,758 --> 00:35:42,924
- Hey Gary.
- How are you?

912
00:35:42,924 --> 00:35:43,761
- My name's Omar, we actually met

913
00:35:43,761 --> 00:35:45,686
in Washington Square
Park back in New York.

914
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:46,519
- [Gary] Yes, that was a fun night, man.

915
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,432
- It was, it was.
- Yeah, I remember you

916
00:35:47,432 --> 00:35:48,265
actually, what's up man?

917
00:35:48,265 --> 00:35:51,093
- Oh thank you, so my question
is, you always talk about

918
00:35:51,093 --> 00:35:52,791
how difficult client services is,

919
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:55,746
so I just wanna know, what was
that first conversation like

920
00:35:55,746 --> 00:35:57,965
when you were getting that
first client for $40,000?

921
00:35:57,965 --> 00:36:00,692
And also, I understand kind
of the long term vision

922
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:03,533
of VaynerMedia, so how
do you see it moving from

923
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:05,612
essentially the client
service marketing machine,

924
00:36:05,612 --> 00:36:07,461
to becoming the private equity machine--

925
00:36:07,461 --> 00:36:09,227
- So, I'll answer number two.

926
00:36:09,227 --> 00:36:12,177
I'm building up my
management team, my winners,

927
00:36:12,177 --> 00:36:14,373
so that one day, just on intuition,

928
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:16,516
I'll feel like it's ready
for me not to be there.

929
00:36:16,516 --> 00:36:17,918
Then I'll spend another six months.

930
00:36:17,918 --> 00:36:20,750
My intuition, my guess right
now is three years from now.

931
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:24,146
I'll spend another six months
tying up all the loose ends,

932
00:36:24,146 --> 00:36:25,282
and then in that same six months

933
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:28,043
I'll start really lookin' for brands.

934
00:36:28,043 --> 00:36:30,725
You know Barney did such a mizpah for me,

935
00:36:30,725 --> 00:36:32,370
you know I'm so excited,
'cause I want K- Swi,

936
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,158
I mean I'm focused on this, right.

937
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,090
The plans we have for next year,

938
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,060
the way I'm thinkin' about
the threes and fours,

939
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,603
I really want K-Swiss to completely,

940
00:36:40,603 --> 00:36:42,512
I mean, for the people that
are really understanding,

941
00:36:42,512 --> 00:36:46,202
I don't think people really
understand K-Swiss's spot

942
00:36:46,202 --> 00:36:48,187
in hip hop culture back in the day like,

943
00:36:48,187 --> 00:36:51,258
real shit, Ice-T, like really.

944
00:36:51,258 --> 00:36:54,232
So I think, I'm excited
'cause I'm givin' it my all

945
00:36:54,232 --> 00:36:55,700
and I want them to win way more than

946
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,301
what they compensate, but for me,

947
00:36:57,301 --> 00:36:59,771
this is a nice little middle test case

948
00:36:59,771 --> 00:37:01,590
for like rejuvenating brands,

949
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,866
'cause that's what I'm thinking about.

950
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:05,853
So that's how I'm thinking about it.

951
00:37:05,853 --> 00:37:10,208
As far as the first
part, you just gotta ask.

952
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:13,350
Like, if you're asking for
yourself, like getting clients,

953
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,254
is that where you're goin'?

954
00:37:14,254 --> 00:37:15,087
- [Omar] No, not
particularly, I was just--

955
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:15,920
- You're just curious?

956
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,753
- [Omar] Yes.

957
00:37:16,753 --> 00:37:17,763
- I just asked.

958
00:37:17,763 --> 00:37:19,137
I just, you know, people were emailing me

959
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:21,297
about Wine Library, I knew
VaynerMedia was coming,

960
00:37:21,297 --> 00:37:23,659
I just would look at their
signature in their email

961
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,101
and be like, hey, I'm
starting a marketing company

962
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:26,405
the way I built this Wine Library,

963
00:37:26,405 --> 00:37:28,414
do you wanna be my client?

964
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:29,943
- [Omar] Right, that's awesome.

965
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:32,440
- Yeah, I don't think people
understand the game of asking.

966
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,775
- [Omar] Right, and never
say no for the other person.

967
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:36,327
- Never say no for the
other person, my man.

968
00:37:36,327 --> 00:37:37,854
- Right, last thing, just kinda somethin'

969
00:37:37,854 --> 00:37:40,137
I mentioned before, I'm
a senior in college,

970
00:37:40,137 --> 00:37:41,969
obviously, I was doing the
whole Wall Street thing,

971
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:44,104
intern at Goldman Sachs,
but I'm actively kind of

972
00:37:44,104 --> 00:37:46,282
trying to segue into
VaynerMedia, so I just wanna say

973
00:37:46,282 --> 00:37:48,262
hopefully maybe I'll see you
in the next few months or so.

974
00:37:48,262 --> 00:37:50,470
- [Gary] I hope so man, pleasure.

975
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,565
- Hi, I'm too short, hi, Gary, oh my god,

976
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:55,641
I had to do the five second
rule to come up here.

977
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:58,291
Okay, first of all thank you,
I'm so grateful to be here

978
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:00,705
and thank you to my boyfriend
and inspirational artist,

979
00:38:00,705 --> 00:38:04,284
Louii King, L-O-U-I-I King.

980
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:06,034
So the main reason I'm here well,

981
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,332
I'm in the health and fitness industry

982
00:38:08,332 --> 00:38:10,364
and I've had my own business
and my nutrition center

983
00:38:10,364 --> 00:38:12,712
running for four years, and I love it,

984
00:38:12,712 --> 00:38:14,237
but I just find so much more passion

985
00:38:14,237 --> 00:38:15,467
in singing and writing--

986
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:16,317
- [Gary] Good for you.

987
00:38:16,317 --> 00:38:18,666
- Yeah, the crazy thing is,
I'm like trying to balance

988
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:20,559
everything and I wake up at five a.m.,

989
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:22,660
I got to sleep at 11, 12, one a.m.

990
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,675
So I'm trying to balance everything out.

991
00:38:25,675 --> 00:38:28,095
Social media's working out,
I just started up my YouTube

992
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:30,391
but I'm having a hard
time staying consistent

993
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,177
with building content.

994
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:34,273
So I was just wondering, should I just

995
00:38:34,273 --> 00:38:35,886
document the struggle?

996
00:38:35,886 --> 00:38:36,719
- Yes, yes.

997
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:38,533
- [Woman Asking Question]
Document how busy I am.

998
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:40,352
- This is why, you already know,

999
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:41,589
that's why you used the word document,

1000
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:43,732
you know that was the
biggest breakthrough for me

1001
00:38:43,732 --> 00:38:45,511
for my audience in the last three years,

1002
00:38:45,511 --> 00:38:47,850
the documenting versus creating.

1003
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:52,762
If you just, guys, we're
interested in each other.

1004
00:38:52,762 --> 00:38:54,644
I'm interested in your struggle.

1005
00:38:54,644 --> 00:38:57,743
I'm interested in what your
favorite fast food place is.

1006
00:38:57,743 --> 00:39:00,550
I'm interested in, are you a Laker fan.

1007
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,535
People are just interested in shit.

1008
00:39:02,535 --> 00:39:03,481
- Yeah, and the crazy thing is,

1009
00:39:03,481 --> 00:39:06,017
I'm also really involved in
the whole motivational thing

1010
00:39:06,017 --> 00:39:08,432
because of my past of drug
abuse and gang violence

1011
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:10,409
and what not, and being
an entrepreneur now,

1012
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:11,310
so it's like--

1013
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,290
- Can I tell you what's holding you up?

1014
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,190
- [Woman Asking Question] Yeah.

1015
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,023
- And all of you.

1016
00:39:14,023 --> 00:39:17,450
You hear me, you just don't wanna accept

1017
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,617
the fuckin' patience part.

1018
00:39:20,634 --> 00:39:21,467
- [Woman Asking Question]
I'll agree with that.

1019
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:23,389
- You're young, you are young.

1020
00:39:23,389 --> 00:39:26,219
You make, you make, like people that are,

1021
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:27,766
Barney, how old are you?

1022
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:28,599
- [Barney] 45.

1023
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:31,720
- Barney's 45 and he's young as fuck.

1024
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,236
Right, like he just is,

1025
00:39:33,236 --> 00:39:36,180
he's got 30 fuckin'
more years in the game.

1026
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,192
Do know how long 30 years is?

1027
00:39:38,192 --> 00:39:40,338
What's fucking you up right now,

1028
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:42,315
is what's fucking them all up.

1029
00:39:42,315 --> 00:39:45,053
You hear me, you're like,
yo, Gary V, patience yeah,

1030
00:39:45,053 --> 00:39:46,824
but you don't live it.

1031
00:39:46,824 --> 00:39:49,524
You don't live it like I do.

1032
00:39:49,524 --> 00:39:51,926
I lived it, and I'm still livin' it.

1033
00:39:51,926 --> 00:39:53,609
Do you know where I'm gonna end up?

1034
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:56,187
(snapping) The tippy fuckin' top.

1035
00:39:56,187 --> 00:40:00,160
You know where I am now, upper middle.

1036
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,665
So I'm patient, I'm grinding, I'm here,

1037
00:40:02,665 --> 00:40:04,944
I'm hustling down there,
I'm fuckin' hustling,

1038
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,359
patient for whatever my like,

1039
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,917
you know, final stop is gonna be.

1040
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:11,645
You're just not patient.

1041
00:40:11,645 --> 00:40:13,809
Like if you're feelin' any angst,

1042
00:40:13,809 --> 00:40:15,167
it's 'cause you don't love the process

1043
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:17,132
more than the results.

1044
00:40:17,132 --> 00:40:19,796
You're thinkin' about
$10,000 a month in Adsense

1045
00:40:19,796 --> 00:40:22,218
instead of loving the fuckin' dirt,

1046
00:40:22,218 --> 00:40:23,591
and loving this grind moment.

1047
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:25,778
And the second you fall
in love with the grind,

1048
00:40:25,778 --> 00:40:28,945
for real, 19 years of it, not a month.

1049
00:40:31,327 --> 00:40:34,066
When you fuckin' really
fall in love with the grind

1050
00:40:34,066 --> 00:40:36,863
and sit here, how old are you, my man?

1051
00:40:36,863 --> 00:40:38,201
How old are you, I know
that's inappropriate.

1052
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:39,659
- [Woman Asking Question] 27.

1053
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:43,492
- 19 years, if you're
like cool, at fuckin' 46

1054
00:40:44,344 --> 00:40:46,005
it's gonna get goin'.

1055
00:40:46,005 --> 00:40:49,210
If you A, knew who young,
Barney, how young do you feel?

1056
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:52,339
- [Barney] Well yeah,
young in this industry,

1057
00:40:52,339 --> 00:40:54,025
it keeps you young.

1058
00:40:54,025 --> 00:40:57,269
- Young, if you knew what 46 felt like,

1059
00:40:57,269 --> 00:40:58,912
19 years wouldn't scare you.

1060
00:40:58,912 --> 00:41:00,980
Right now it does.

1061
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:04,140
'Cause it's almost your
whole fuckin' life.

1062
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,685
That's it, patience.

1063
00:41:05,685 --> 00:41:06,518
- [Woman Asking Question] Got it.

1064
00:41:06,518 --> 00:41:09,753
- Don't do every, if you're
really grinding five to 11,

1065
00:41:09,753 --> 00:41:12,158
well then you're fuckin' doin' the work,

1066
00:41:12,158 --> 00:41:14,219
now the next part is
patience, and then your talent

1067
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:16,330
is gonna take you where
it's gonna take you.

1068
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:18,035
Either you got it or you don't.

1069
00:41:18,035 --> 00:41:18,868
- [Woman Asking Question] I do.

1070
00:41:18,868 --> 00:41:21,424
- And if you do, you
have it to some level.

1071
00:41:21,424 --> 00:41:23,848
And somewhere between
Beyonce and Shmeonce,

1072
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:25,992
is where you're gonna end up.

1073
00:41:25,992 --> 00:41:27,796
And you just, as long as
you're putting in the grind

1074
00:41:27,796 --> 00:41:30,676
and having the hustle,
you just gotta respect

1075
00:41:30,676 --> 00:41:34,556
that somewhere between
Beyonce and Shmeonce, right?

1076
00:41:34,556 --> 00:41:35,973
Or, you're pickin' the wrong thing

1077
00:41:35,973 --> 00:41:37,644
and you're romantic
about music, but you're

1078
00:41:37,644 --> 00:41:41,029
the best architect that ever
lived, but you never tried it.

1079
00:41:41,029 --> 00:41:43,046
That's the framework.

1080
00:41:43,046 --> 00:41:45,595
If you're workin' as hard as
you can, and you're patient,

1081
00:41:45,595 --> 00:41:50,175
then your talent is gonna take
you to where it is, right?

1082
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:51,151
Or, did you pick the wrong thing.

1083
00:41:51,151 --> 00:41:54,828
Listen, I wish I could be a rapper.

1084
00:41:54,828 --> 00:41:57,396
But I just know, I'm
not, and I know I've got

1085
00:41:57,396 --> 00:42:00,901
rapper tendencies, in the way that I talk,

1086
00:42:00,901 --> 00:42:02,762
but I'm an entrepreneur.

1087
00:42:02,762 --> 00:42:04,272
I will fuckin' build a bigger business

1088
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,610
than all of you combined
every day of the week.

1089
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,678
That's the fuckin' facts.

1090
00:42:08,678 --> 00:42:10,311
That's it, take it for what it is,

1091
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:11,897
and if that motivates you, show me,

1092
00:42:11,897 --> 00:42:16,428
email me in 15 years
with this clip, show me.

1093
00:42:16,428 --> 00:42:17,364
- [Woman Asking Question]
Thank you so much.

1094
00:42:17,364 --> 00:42:20,439
(audience applauding)

1095
00:42:20,439 --> 00:42:21,884
- [Man] This is our last question, guys.

1096
00:42:21,884 --> 00:42:22,717
- My man.

1097
00:42:22,717 --> 00:42:24,264
- Hey, how's it goin' man,
my name's Austin Reynolds

1098
00:42:24,264 --> 00:42:26,958
from South Florida, off the
rip, I just wanted to tell you

1099
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:28,997
thank you so much for inspiring all of us.

1100
00:42:28,997 --> 00:42:30,857
I've gone through some
difficulties in the past couple

1101
00:42:30,857 --> 00:42:33,437
years and your words have
really got me through

1102
00:42:33,437 --> 00:42:35,692
some struggles and everything and--

1103
00:42:35,692 --> 00:42:37,517
- Means a lot to me, man.
- My question for you is,

1104
00:42:37,517 --> 00:42:40,108
I've gone through probably 15 surgeries,

1105
00:42:40,108 --> 00:42:43,506
physical therapies, here
and there and I'm trying to

1106
00:42:43,506 --> 00:42:45,478
piece all the documentation together

1107
00:42:45,478 --> 00:42:47,361
and try to make an impact to others

1108
00:42:47,361 --> 00:42:49,035
by sharing them my positivity

1109
00:42:49,035 --> 00:42:50,779
that nothing's ever really hold me back

1110
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:53,730
or held me down, and I
was gonna see what someone

1111
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,711
from your stature, from
someone who's made it

1112
00:42:56,711 --> 00:42:58,935
in the industry to someone
who's trying to become

1113
00:42:58,935 --> 00:43:01,927
and up and coming, how do you get there?

1114
00:43:01,927 --> 00:43:03,599
- How you get to the next spot?

1115
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:04,432
- [Austin] Yes.

1116
00:43:04,432 --> 00:43:06,000
- You know it's gonna be the
repeat of the last thing,

1117
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,829
and the truth is, you
know, your circumstance

1118
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:14,289
matters so fuckin' much,
because it's one thing

1119
00:43:14,289 --> 00:43:17,215
if you've got less adversity in your life,

1120
00:43:17,215 --> 00:43:20,424
regardless of what it is, for
everybody else in this room

1121
00:43:20,424 --> 00:43:22,982
who's not in a machine right now, right?

1122
00:43:22,982 --> 00:43:25,161
If you're in the negative mindset.

1123
00:43:25,161 --> 00:43:26,801
It's a whole different
thing to the audience

1124
00:43:26,801 --> 00:43:29,224
that sees themselves in you.

1125
00:43:29,224 --> 00:43:31,397
It's real easy to get dark.

1126
00:43:31,397 --> 00:43:33,623
It's real easy to not see it, right?

1127
00:43:33,623 --> 00:43:36,394
So it's gonna be patience and
things of that nature, right.

1128
00:43:36,394 --> 00:43:38,472
It's gonna be the same
stuff, and it's gonna be

1129
00:43:38,472 --> 00:43:39,909
the stuff that I started with, which is,

1130
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:41,713
so, back to what you were saying,

1131
00:43:41,713 --> 00:43:43,875
'cause I wanna take my
last two minutes with you.

1132
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:45,115
- [Austin] Okay.

1133
00:43:45,115 --> 00:43:47,808
- How are you putting out your content?

1134
00:43:47,808 --> 00:43:50,012
- Through Instagram and through Snapchat.

1135
00:43:50,012 --> 00:43:52,934
I haven't really executed
anything, I've kind of,

1136
00:43:52,934 --> 00:43:56,734
have a very large base back
at home in South Florida

1137
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:58,698
and everyone kind of knows
who I am in my home city

1138
00:43:58,698 --> 00:44:01,413
and high school, and my
college that I went to.

1139
00:44:01,413 --> 00:44:03,384
So everyone's kind of known who I am,

1140
00:44:03,384 --> 00:44:05,023
and I've always kind of been uplifted,

1141
00:44:05,023 --> 00:44:07,431
I've never been held back,
never looked at anything.

1142
00:44:07,431 --> 00:44:09,920
I traveled 3,000 miles just in California

1143
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,323
to see you with my buddy
so, everything kinda

1144
00:44:12,323 --> 00:44:15,365
doesn't hold me back, so what,

1145
00:44:15,365 --> 00:44:18,366
I just am having struggles
kinda getting the content--

1146
00:44:18,366 --> 00:44:19,981
- What do you want to happen?

1147
00:44:19,981 --> 00:44:23,272
No bullshit, like you
wanna, like from a fame

1148
00:44:23,272 --> 00:44:25,205
and financial standpoint.

1149
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:27,229
- I don't want any financial,
I don't want any fame,

1150
00:44:27,229 --> 00:44:30,632
I want people to read
that I'm four foot four,

1151
00:44:30,632 --> 00:44:33,816
22 years old, went through 15 surgeries,

1152
00:44:33,816 --> 00:44:35,917
and born with dwarfism,
that I'm at ComplexCon

1153
00:44:35,917 --> 00:44:37,933
in Santa Monica, and
I didn't let anything,

1154
00:44:37,933 --> 00:44:39,314
any shit hold me back.

1155
00:44:39,314 --> 00:44:40,688
(audience applauding)

1156
00:44:40,688 --> 00:44:43,202
- Well good news, hopefully
DRock's been filming,

1157
00:44:43,202 --> 00:44:44,495
somebody's been filming.

1158
00:44:44,495 --> 00:44:45,669
We'll definitely make sure that happens

1159
00:44:45,669 --> 00:44:47,289
to some small degree.

1160
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:49,820
Let me give you a good piece of advice.

1161
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,700
You need to get somebody
who does what DRock

1162
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,107
and Babin do, and you
need to start vlogging,

1163
00:44:54,107 --> 00:44:55,390
and somebody filming you.

1164
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:58,605
And I'll help you get somebody
for free for a year, got it?

1165
00:44:58,605 --> 00:44:59,438
- [Austin] Got it.

1166
00:44:59,438 --> 00:45:01,039
- And by the way, not beca,
by the way, real quick,

1167
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:02,908
not 'cause I'm gonna pay,
I'm not that great of a guy,

1168
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,684
I mean it, it's because there's so many

1169
00:45:04,684 --> 00:45:06,903
amazing creators who'd want to do it,

1170
00:45:06,903 --> 00:45:08,450
and they're gonna know that I care,

1171
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:09,619
and if they do it for him for a year

1172
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:12,130
then I will do something,
I don't know what,

1173
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:13,320
that's number one.

1174
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,045
Number two, you're gonna make
it a Facebook Watch show.

1175
00:45:17,045 --> 00:45:18,905
So everybody's tryin'
to blast off on YouTube

1176
00:45:18,905 --> 00:45:21,493
and it's hard, 'cause supply
and demand of attention,

1177
00:45:21,493 --> 00:45:23,544
there's a lot of shit on YouTube,

1178
00:45:23,544 --> 00:45:25,346
and there's not a lot
of growth hacking ways

1179
00:45:25,346 --> 00:45:28,013
to get there, collaborations,
there's some stuff,

1180
00:45:28,013 --> 00:45:30,292
thumbnails, titles, but
it's a fucking grind

1181
00:45:30,292 --> 00:45:33,125
even for us, we haven't popped it.

1182
00:45:34,088 --> 00:45:36,857
Facebook Watch, for all of you right now,

1183
00:45:36,857 --> 00:45:38,252
I'm telling you right now, I'm so happy,

1184
00:45:38,252 --> 00:45:40,012
I haven't said this really publicly yet,

1185
00:45:40,012 --> 00:45:42,782
Facebook Watch is a huge
opportunity, here's why.

1186
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:46,925
Facebook wants to kill YouTube,
'cause Zucks is a gangster.

1187
00:45:46,925 --> 00:45:47,758
(audience laughing)

1188
00:45:47,758 --> 00:45:49,858
I know he doesn't look like it,

1189
00:45:49,858 --> 00:45:52,794
but take every gangster
downstairs combined

1190
00:45:52,794 --> 00:45:56,270
and they don't have shit
on one little Zucks.

1191
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:58,428
Dude is a fuckin' gangster.

1192
00:45:58,428 --> 00:46:00,673
So, here's what Facebook's doing.

1193
00:46:00,673 --> 00:46:02,587
If you make a Watch show,
and if you don't know

1194
00:46:02,587 --> 00:46:05,191
what I mean when I say
Facebook Watch, news alert,

1195
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:07,728
Google, what is Facebook Watch?

1196
00:46:07,728 --> 00:46:11,222
Read it, understand it, start your vlog

1197
00:46:11,222 --> 00:46:14,301
on Facebook Watch, not on YouTube.

1198
00:46:14,301 --> 00:46:19,131
Because Facebook wants
Facebook Watch to work, right.

1199
00:46:19,131 --> 00:46:21,228
So they're gonna give
you extra distribution

1200
00:46:21,228 --> 00:46:22,698
even though you got nobody.

1201
00:46:22,698 --> 00:46:24,901
Take your Facebook fan
page, take your Insta,

1202
00:46:24,901 --> 00:46:26,888
take your Snap, take your YouTube,

1203
00:46:26,888 --> 00:46:28,857
take the signature in your email,

1204
00:46:28,857 --> 00:46:30,918
and push everything into
your Facebook Watch.

1205
00:46:30,918 --> 00:46:33,360
Call 36 of your homies and be like, yo,

1206
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,054
it would just mean the fuckin' world to me

1207
00:46:35,054 --> 00:46:37,218
if you subscribed to my Facebook Watch,

1208
00:46:37,218 --> 00:46:39,816
and the first one that comes
out, just share it and like it.

1209
00:46:39,816 --> 00:46:40,649
Got it?

1210
00:46:40,649 --> 00:46:43,098
Just fuckin', I always talk a, this is why

1211
00:46:43,098 --> 00:46:45,626
I love this culture, it's just mix tapes

1212
00:46:45,626 --> 00:46:48,643
from the back of your
fuckin' hoop-di, you know.

1213
00:46:48,643 --> 00:46:50,237
It's just the baseball card show, like,

1214
00:46:50,237 --> 00:46:51,956
I got goosebumps all up in my body

1215
00:46:51,956 --> 00:46:52,817
when I walked down there.

1216
00:46:52,817 --> 00:46:55,580
I'm like, this is a
baseball card show, right?

1217
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,127
It was how I grew, it
was sellin' blow pops

1218
00:46:57,127 --> 00:47:01,746
out of my backpack, that's all
this is, it's the same shit.

1219
00:47:01,746 --> 00:47:03,806
It's just with attention,
and the stakes are bigger.

1220
00:47:03,806 --> 00:47:07,232
Facebook Watch vlog, get
everybody in your high school

1221
00:47:07,232 --> 00:47:09,994
and college and anybody that
ever gave a fuck about you.

1222
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:13,345
Take two straight days and just
fuckin' lounge and be like,

1223
00:47:13,345 --> 00:47:15,850
this link, follow me on this show.

1224
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:16,838
When I have a new book comin' out,

1225
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:18,860
like I have Crushing
It come out in January,

1226
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:21,027
during my holiday vacation this winter,

1227
00:47:21,027 --> 00:47:23,389
I will lay there and hit
up every person one-by-one,

1228
00:47:23,389 --> 00:47:25,801
not bulk blast email.

1229
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,706
Not an Instagram story.

1230
00:47:27,706 --> 00:47:31,873
One, by one, by one, and
be like, yo, buy my book.

1231
00:47:32,815 --> 00:47:34,391
And so, everybody here can do that

1232
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:36,999
for whatever the fuck they want.

1233
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:40,187
Get 813 people to follow your Watch show,

1234
00:47:40,187 --> 00:47:41,626

1235
00:47:41,626 --> 00:47:43,696

hitting up everybody, right?

Facebook Watch vlog, right,

00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:57,607
and share it, somethin' will happen.

1241
00:47:57,607 --> 00:47:59,092
Mark my words.

1242
00:47:59,092 --> 00:47:59,925
- [Austin] Thank you so much.

1243
00:47:59,925 --> 00:48:00,762
- You're welcome so much.

1244

00:48:10,824 --> 00:48:12,741
take a picture, or not.

1248
00:48:13,663 --> 00:48:16,643
Hug it out, or not, but
I appreciate all of you,

1249
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,476
have a good day.

1250

three cents in the comment
section on two things,

1254
00:48:27,141 --> 00:48:30,672

you had during Thanksgiving?

1255
00:48:30,672 --> 00:48:33,326
And two, what was the unique, new insight

1256
00:48:33,326 --> 00:48:35,353

See ya.

1258
