1
00:00:00,526 --> 00:00:02,994
- Podcast Nation, what is up?

2
00:00:02,994 --> 00:00:05,550
It's me Gary, a very exciting day for me.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,721
We're recording this right now,

4
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:08,415
as the book is being launched.

5
00:00:08,415 --> 00:00:10,697
It's Launch Day, it's
going extremely well.

6
00:00:10,697 --> 00:00:12,383
And I wanna first start and say thank you

7
00:00:12,383 --> 00:00:13,621
to all of you that are supporting.

8
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:15,335
I really, really, really,
really do appreciate it.

9
00:00:15,335 --> 00:00:17,844
But more importantly, we're
doing our second Pod Sessions.

10
00:00:17,844 --> 00:00:19,307
If you missed the first one,

11
00:00:19,307 --> 00:00:20,743
when I think about my career,

12
00:00:20,743 --> 00:00:23,842
the late night, hanging
out in a hotel room

13
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:27,417
with a bunch of the early
Silicon Valley Web 2.0

14
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:30,075
investors and founders

15
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:33,220
really shaped a lot of
my thinking and growth

16
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,888
and those used to be
called the Jam Sessions.

17
00:00:35,888 --> 00:00:38,620
Chris Sacca of Shark Tank theme

18
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,664
and venture capital theme
did a huge piece about,

19
00:00:41,664 --> 00:00:44,497
they did a huge piece
on him in Vanity Fair

20
00:00:44,497 --> 00:00:46,460
and he goes into it
there, so go Google that,

21
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,572
and that explains what
those late nights were.

22
00:00:48,572 --> 00:00:51,157
But they were, they were
essential moments for me,

23
00:00:51,157 --> 00:00:52,333
and then when I started seeing,

24
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,593
like documentaries about like Spielberg

25
00:00:54,593 --> 00:00:57,313
and Martin Scorsese like they
had their little Rat Pack

26
00:00:57,313 --> 00:00:58,717
in the mid-70s

27
00:00:58,717 --> 00:01:00,573
and then you think about artists, right,

28
00:01:00,573 --> 00:01:02,355
like Janis Joplin and those, like

29
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:05,184
it's interesting to me that
you have these pockets.

30
00:01:05,184 --> 00:01:06,959
I'm like, you know, I
wanna replicate that.

31
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,271
There's a whole new thing
that I'm a part of now.

32
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:12,235
Entrepreneurs, influencers,

33
00:01:12,235 --> 00:01:15,003
entrepreneurs like me that
have done it who are now

34
00:01:15,003 --> 00:01:17,658
entering the new attention world

35
00:01:17,658 --> 00:01:20,678
and I was like, wow, I
really wanna do this called

36
00:01:20,678 --> 00:01:22,892
Pod Sessions instead of Jam Sessions,

37
00:01:22,892 --> 00:01:24,297
where on my podcast,

38
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:26,540
I wanna bring in three people

39
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,944
or this time four 'cause
we've got a partnership here,

40
00:01:28,944 --> 00:01:31,257
you know, three or four people who

41
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,971
I'm interested in, who I think
are doing interesting things,

42
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:36,552
and who I think are doing
versions of what I'm doing

43
00:01:36,552 --> 00:01:38,604
and can bring value to my audience

44
00:01:38,604 --> 00:01:41,076
'cause they're doing it
but from a different way,

45
00:01:41,076 --> 00:01:43,300
slightly different, different angle.

46
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,035
And what would happen
if I just get them in

47
00:01:45,035 --> 00:01:47,084
and shoot the shit about
what's happening in culture?

48
00:01:47,084 --> 00:01:49,472
What can happen in all
these different, you know,

49
00:01:49,472 --> 00:01:50,794
atoms bouncing around?

50
00:01:50,794 --> 00:01:52,378
And so this is Pod Sessions number two.

51
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,900
I'm super excited.

52
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,477
And I'm going to let my
guests introduce themselves,

53
00:01:56,477 --> 00:01:58,419
so guests, introduce yourselves,

54
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:01,366
and just give me the one minute
origin, state of the union,

55
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:03,724
kinda just a nice little recap
for a lot of the audience

56
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,391
who may not know who you are.

57
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,389
Let's start with the
legend herself, Bobbi,

58
00:02:07,389 --> 00:02:08,636
we're gonna start with you.

59
00:02:08,636 --> 00:02:10,323
- Ah thank you, I hate
being called a legend,

60
00:02:10,323 --> 00:02:11,862
that just means I'm the
oldest of the group.

61
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:13,024
- It's true, it's where I was going.

62
00:02:13,024 --> 00:02:14,402
- Okay, okay, good.

63
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:15,565
And I'm 60 and proud of it.

64
00:02:15,565 --> 00:02:18,086
- You look so fucking good.

65
00:02:18,086 --> 00:02:20,207
By the way, the reason you
always say 60 and do that,

66
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,767
'cause you know you look
fucking 43 (laughter).

67
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,337
It's so fucking weird, like, like.

68
00:02:25,337 --> 00:02:26,521
- And I could actually do this,

69
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,869
no one else in America could do that.

70
00:02:27,869 --> 00:02:29,054
- But really Bobbi, you are,

71
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:31,984
you love that you look so
good for your age, right?

72
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:34,008
- Yes, and you should see my dad at 82.

73
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:34,841
- He kills it?

74
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:37,841
- Oh, he kills it, he's
handsome, he's good-looking,

75
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:39,426
he's every awesome.

76
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:40,259
He's really cool.

77
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:41,612
- Like his social life is on point?

78
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:43,312
- He's single right now.

79
00:02:43,312 --> 00:02:44,718
- He's having fun.

80
00:02:44,718 --> 00:02:46,515
Is he sliding into the DM?

81
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:48,039
- He changed his whole career.

82
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:50,646
He's an ex-lawyer,
children's book author now,

83
00:02:50,646 --> 00:02:52,216
so he's killin' it, he has
a whole 'nother life at 82.

84
00:02:52,216 --> 00:02:55,073
- Pod Sessions number three Tyler.

85
00:02:55,073 --> 00:02:55,906
- Honestly, it's amazing.

86
00:02:55,906 --> 00:02:57,187
But anyways, I'm Bobbi Brown,

87
00:02:57,187 --> 00:02:59,337
and I'm the founder of
Bobbi Brown cosmetics.

88
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:02,160
Stayed with the corporation 22 years.

89
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,087
I left a year and a half ago,

90
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:06,850
and I started a lifestyle brand.

91
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,049
- You're up to no good right now, right?

92
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:09,841
- I'm up to no good, I launched a hotel,

93
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:12,792
we're launching wellness products,
we're launching a website

94
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,430
and Facebook Live and,
we just keep doin' stuff,

95
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,462
you know why?

96
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,458
'Cause I can. (laughter)

97
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,681
- Are happy, are you super pumped?

98
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:21,548
After being in a
corporation that long, like

99
00:03:21,548 --> 00:03:22,973
are you like, you're like a bird now.

100
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:24,850
- Like out of jail, yeah.

101
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,683
- Good for you.

102
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:27,006
Okay, we'll get back to you in a minute.

103
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,061
- Yes, I'm Anna Victoria.

104
00:03:29,061 --> 00:03:32,221
I am a fitness influencer,
personal trainer,

105
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:37,163
and my brand started back in
about 2012 unintentionally.

106
00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:40,328
And back in 2012 really, when
Instagram was starting out

107
00:03:40,328 --> 00:03:43,525
and I had no idea what I
was getting myself into.

108
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:45,345
Fast forward almost six years,

109
00:03:45,345 --> 00:03:47,318
I now have built a personal brand

110
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:49,302
and I'm in the fitness-wellness space

111
00:03:49,302 --> 00:03:51,563
and I really vibe off of authenticity

112
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:53,736
and just being real and
connecting with people.

113
00:03:53,736 --> 00:03:55,272
And of course, helping people.

114
00:03:55,272 --> 00:03:56,398
- Anna, I think there's two core points

115
00:03:56,398 --> 00:03:57,307
that you didn't bring in here,

116
00:03:57,307 --> 00:03:58,633
I wanna bring right from the beginning.

117
00:03:58,633 --> 00:04:00,512
One, why you started your Instagram.

118
00:04:00,512 --> 00:04:01,347
I think that's super interesting,

119
00:04:01,347 --> 00:04:04,713
and two, I think you've
converted your attention

120
00:04:04,713 --> 00:04:06,617
into an app, which I think is important

121
00:04:06,617 --> 00:04:08,261
for a lot of influencers to think about,

122
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:10,272
not just being in the business of

123
00:04:10,272 --> 00:04:13,012
getting paid for, you
know, product placement.

124
00:04:13,012 --> 00:04:15,124
I think when we get to the
next group of gentlemen,

125
00:04:15,124 --> 00:04:17,319
I think they've done
it as well as anybody.

126
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,738
Give us those two little points.

127
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:23,193
- Yeah, so I did start my journey
because of health problems

128
00:04:23,193 --> 00:04:25,663
so it wasn't your stereotypical,
like, oh, I wanna look good

129
00:04:25,663 --> 00:04:28,312
and I'm gonna inspire other
people to wanna look good, too.

130
00:04:28,312 --> 00:04:29,742
I was, I grew up in the U.S.,

131
00:04:29,742 --> 00:04:31,506
in Northern California, small town.

132
00:04:31,506 --> 00:04:34,094
Grew up eating junk food,
saw nuthin' wrong with it.

133
00:04:34,094 --> 00:04:37,495
I loved it, and it wasn't until

134
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:39,928
my early 20s, I started
having health problems.

135
00:04:39,928 --> 00:04:42,154
I really did not put two and two together.

136
00:04:42,154 --> 00:04:43,806
Had to go to the Emergency
Room and they were like,

137
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:46,599
here's medicine and I
was like, okay, you know,

138
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:50,146
like, that's what the
very typical prescription

139
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:51,546
and I took the medicine,

140
00:04:51,546 --> 00:04:53,818
could tell there was still
an underlying reason,

141
00:04:53,818 --> 00:04:55,418
this was, for my health problems.

142
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:56,717
This was early on in my relationship

143
00:04:56,717 --> 00:04:58,329
with my now husband, Luca,

144
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:00,633
who is born and raised
in Rome, Italy, where.

145
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,942
- By the way, for everybody
that needs to know this,

146
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:03,157
'cause if you're listening on audio,

147
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:05,843
Luca is so good looking (laughter).

148
00:05:05,843 --> 00:05:06,676
- He is.

149
00:05:06,676 --> 00:05:08,075
- I had a meeting with them.

150
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,751
By the way, Anna's such a beautiful woman.

151
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:11,510
And I had a meeting with
them, the other day,

152
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,673
I'm like, fuckin' Luca.

153
00:05:12,673 --> 00:05:14,103
- Oh my gawd (laughter).

154
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:15,563
- I'm a dude, by the way.

155
00:05:15,563 --> 00:05:16,952
You know, so like, it was funny.

156
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:17,785
Anyway keep going.

157
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,094
- I will second that.

158
00:05:19,094 --> 00:05:20,744
So he would look at me, you know,

159
00:05:20,744 --> 00:05:22,114
early on in our relationship and say,

160
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,369
Anna, you can't eat Goldfish
crackers for dinner.

161
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:25,332
And I'd be like, why not?

162
00:05:25,332 --> 00:05:27,273
They're delicious, you know, I love them.

163
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:28,904
And for me, food was pure indulgence.

164
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:30,600
That's what I was raised on.

165
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,566
Enter, health problems
early 20s and you know,

166
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,847
then we moved to China
after I graduated college

167
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:38,769
and that's when he was like,
you have no more excuses.

168
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:41,774
You have time to start
working out, eating healthy.

169
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,725
The crazy thing is I'm more busy now

170
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:45,399
then when I was in
college, and quote unquote

171
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,357
didn't have time.

172
00:05:47,357 --> 00:05:49,659
Anyway, so there's that
piece and that's why my brand

173
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:52,008
is very much focused on, first
and foremost, working out,

174
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:54,150
fueling, nourishing your
body for health reasons.

175
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,925
And then the aesthetic reasons will come,

176
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:56,758
and there's nothing wrong

177
00:05:56,758 --> 00:05:58,462
with wanting to look better either.

178
00:05:58,462 --> 00:05:59,353
So the next part is.

179
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:01,191
- It's Tyler's entire being. (laughter)

180
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:03,345
He's only trying to look
better at all times.

181
00:06:03,345 --> 00:06:06,431
He spends all his time on that.

182
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:08,803
- So I launched Guides early on

183
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:11,379
and then that transitioned
into my Body Love app,

184
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:13,113
which just launched about a month ago.

185
00:06:13,113 --> 00:06:15,977
And yeah, so that's a
whole 'nother world that

186
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:18,646
we have entered and it's been incredibly

187
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:21,085
amazing and exploding,
almost beyond our means.

188
00:06:21,085 --> 00:06:23,844
And difficult, yes, it's hard
for me to come to terms with

189
00:06:23,844 --> 00:06:26,181
the fact that glitches are a
part of this whole app process.

190
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:27,728
- The biggest for problem for people

191
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:29,707
when they go into the technology business

192
00:06:29,707 --> 00:06:30,825
is they don't realize they're going into

193
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:32,134
the technology business.

194
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:33,754
The amount of people that come to me

195
00:06:33,754 --> 00:06:36,988
that are personal brands that
wanna move it into something

196
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:38,412
and are like, I'm gonna start this app,

197
00:06:38,412 --> 00:06:39,795
and I'm like, do you have a co-founder?

198
00:06:39,795 --> 00:06:41,565
No, I'm using this outside
agency to build it.

199
00:06:41,565 --> 00:06:43,772
I'm like, you're in deep fuckin' shit,

200
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:46,913
because you're in the technology business.

201
00:06:46,913 --> 00:06:48,360
Nonetheless, thank you, we'll move on.

202
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,193
- Matt.

203
00:06:49,193 --> 00:06:50,557
- Hi.

204
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:51,902
Apologize for my bad voice,

205
00:06:51,902 --> 00:06:54,211
I had a really bad cold yesterday.

206
00:06:54,211 --> 00:06:55,668
- No problem.

207
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:59,473
The accent and the cold makes
this an audio experience,

208
00:06:59,473 --> 00:07:00,631
which is what I'm going for.

209
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:02,839
I'm thrilled that you have the cold.

210
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,672
- Thank you, thank you man.

211
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:05,018
- You're welcome, no problem.

212
00:07:05,018 --> 00:07:06,536
- My name is Ralph de Geus,

213
00:07:06,536 --> 00:07:08,712
I'm from the Netherlands,
nearby Amsterdam.

214
00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:12,136
I'm the co-founder of
BALR, the lifestyle brand.

215
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:14,368
- B A L R, some of you have
seen me wear the beanie,

216
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:15,260
I love it.

217
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,919
- Balr, lifestyle brands.

218
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:18,752
And 433.

219
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,120
- At 433, a monstrous

220
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,421
football, I mean you're being very nice.

221
00:07:24,421 --> 00:07:25,853
I'll say football, you say soccer,

222
00:07:25,853 --> 00:07:27,366
we're being polite to each other.

223
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:30,363
Community, digital community,
I know it for its Instagram,

224
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:31,375
I'm curious to learn a little bit more

225
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,865
of what else you're doing
with it, keep going.

226
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:37,332
- We built both companies since 2013.

227
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:41,760
I think with 433, we were one
of the first at Instagram.

228
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,917
I think today, we have
over 16 million followers.

229
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:45,750
- How many?

230
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,711
- 16 million followers.

231
00:07:46,711 --> 00:07:47,615
- One six.

232
00:07:47,615 --> 00:07:49,625
- One six million followers.

233
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:53,046
We generate over 1.6 billion views,

234
00:07:53,046 --> 00:07:54,962
sorry, impressions per month.

235
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:59,109
And we have, I think, 600
million video views per month.

236
00:07:59,109 --> 00:08:00,901
- Yeah, I mean, I dunno
if you guys know but

237
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:05,267
soccer is pretty big in
the world, it is the sport.

238
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:07,830
Luca's like crying, he's so happy.

239
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,979
- All the football stars
like Cristiano Ronaldo,

240
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,185
Marcelo, Neymar, they follow all 433.

241
00:08:14,185 --> 00:08:15,800
- Some good-lookin' dudes, too.

242
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,550
- American soccer's up there, too.

243
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,764
- No American soccer's doing same, listen,

244
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,656
I was devastated that
the U.S. didn't qualify

245
00:08:21,656 --> 00:08:24,647
for this World Cup, 'cause
it slows down the process

246
00:08:24,647 --> 00:08:26,911
for American Soccer,
because the last two runs

247
00:08:26,911 --> 00:08:28,149
are so important.

248
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:30,400
America's so America,

249
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,880
like, God forbid America
ever wins the World Cup.

250
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,158
It will be our biggest sport,
because we're just that way,

251
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:39,505
we get so caught up in our own meshugas.

252
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:41,238
- One of my besties is the Commissioner.

253
00:08:41,238 --> 00:08:44,024
- Oh, I know he's that
Montclair boy, he's the best.

254
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,799
DJ's the best, and your partner here.

255
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,622
- My name's Juul Manders,

256
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:51,390
CEO co-founder of both the
companies, BALR and 433.

257
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,120
Let's explain a little
bit more about BALR.

258
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,965
One of the other founder,
he's not here today,

259
00:08:56,965 --> 00:08:58,308
but he was a professional football player,

260
00:08:58,308 --> 00:09:01,165
soccer player, sorry,
play for the Dutch squad

261
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:04,998
and in the World
Championship et cetera, Demy.

262
00:09:06,597 --> 00:09:07,971
We created a brand, like,

263
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:10,844
as soon as the professional
soccer play steps off the pitch,

264
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:12,559
the life of a baller begins.

265
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,956
So it can be an NBA player, an NFL player,

266
00:09:14,956 --> 00:09:16,797
but as soon as he steps off to pitch,

267
00:09:16,797 --> 00:09:17,920
the life of a baller begins.

268
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,020
And actually, what we created
is a lifestyle fashion brand.

269
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,980
And yeah, we like, Justin
Bieber got two suitcases

270
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,113
full of our stuff because
he want to have some.

271
00:09:27,113 --> 00:09:27,946
- In Montclair, probably.

272
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:29,187
- I was gonna say, he's
a Montclair kid, too.

273
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:33,770
- Yes, but like, it's, we
have Neymar wearing our gear.

274
00:09:35,178 --> 00:09:36,561
- Yeah, just to jump in to paint a picture

275
00:09:36,561 --> 00:09:38,069
for a lot of people that
may not be familiar with

276
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:39,736
B A L R, Balr brand.

277
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,827
When he talks about player
coming off the pitch,

278
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:45,550
my brother A.J. left VaynerMedia.

279
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,320
We started VaynerSports.

280
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,753
We're gonna disproportionately disrupt the

281
00:09:50,753 --> 00:09:51,961
sports representation business

282
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:56,522
because we are so over focused
on what happens off the field

283
00:09:56,522 --> 00:09:59,151
outside of your sneaker deal,
and your sports cards deal.

284
00:09:59,151 --> 00:10:02,418
Most agencies aren't
providing real financial

285
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:03,915
and business opportunities to the degree

286
00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:05,760
that I think they should.

287
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,660
And, we've started building

288
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,585
a little relationship with these guys.

289
00:10:08,585 --> 00:10:11,529
I'm actually having a meeting
with them after this podcast.

290
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:13,694
We sent, and these are now, remember,

291
00:10:13,694 --> 00:10:17,530
18, 19-year olds, excuse me,
I'm sorry, 21, 22-year olds

292
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,047
guys we signed this year.

293
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:21,123
We sent them some care
packages of the product.

294
00:10:21,123 --> 00:10:24,368
These are American football
players, like from the streets,

295
00:10:24,368 --> 00:10:27,213
right, and they love,
like every one of them

296
00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:31,069
has hit me up like, holy shit,
I fuckin' love this brand.

297
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:34,341
So there's clearly, you're
clearly doing the right thing

298
00:10:34,341 --> 00:10:35,672
and it's resonating.

299
00:10:35,672 --> 00:10:38,311
I don't think, I see a lot of
brands that start in Europe

300
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:40,705
that don't understand U.S. sensibility.

301
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:42,686
I think your brand has U.S. sensibility.

302
00:10:42,686 --> 00:10:45,447
It's the biggest reason
you're even sitting here,

303
00:10:45,447 --> 00:10:46,280
in my opinion.

304
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,981
That, and I think you
smartly took the leverage

305
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:53,731
from the 433 attention and
pushed it to a product company

306
00:10:54,962 --> 00:10:57,233
that creates much bigger
upside financially

307
00:10:57,233 --> 00:11:01,448
and isn't at the mercy of an
algorithm or an M&A activity

308
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:05,084
or a platform or social
network falling off.

309
00:11:05,084 --> 00:11:07,035
Alright, let's go back around.

310
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:10,590
This is the part where I'm
most interested in, personally.

311
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,264
I'm gonna take you in
a different direction.

312
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:13,417
Good thing Bobbi's a quick thinker,

313
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:15,888
'cause she's gonna have
to think the quickest.

314
00:11:15,888 --> 00:11:18,764
What are you obsessed with right now?

315
00:11:18,764 --> 00:11:21,855
In culture, in life,
this could be anything,

316
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:23,667
like literally anything.

317
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,345
This isn't about business, or what app,

318
00:11:25,345 --> 00:11:27,095
like the 360 of life.

319
00:11:28,157 --> 00:11:30,627
Bobbi, what are you
obsessed with right now?

320
00:11:30,627 --> 00:11:33,061
- Living a better life,
feeling better in your skin,

321
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:36,607
being able to figure out
how you can eat properly

322
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:39,210
so you can fuel yourself
to feel your best.

323
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,312
I think that's what
all anyone cares about.

324
00:11:41,312 --> 00:11:42,862
I don't care what's happening.

325
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:44,059
Our world is changing.

326
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:45,300
We don't have to talk about anything.

327
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,954
Every single person wants
to live a better life

328
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:51,562
and be with their family,
work harder, work smarter

329
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:55,465
and beauty from the inside out
has always been my platform.

330
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,007
And I believe in it more than anything.

331
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:00,151
And I'm obsessed with how
you can drink espresso

332
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:02,393
in the morning and have
a vodka tequila at night

333
00:12:02,393 --> 00:12:04,010
and be your healthiest self.

334
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,383
- Interesting, thank you, Anna?

335
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:09,060
- Alright, yeah, so I
touched on this earlier,

336
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,088
that I really vibe off of authenticity

337
00:12:11,088 --> 00:12:12,259
and just being raw.

338
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:16,063
I live in the social media
world and so I am just

339
00:12:16,063 --> 00:12:21,063
obsessed with women who are
so unapologetically themselves

340
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:24,366
and show the whole flaws side of them.

341
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:26,027
- Did you see this whole,
like, showing your gray hair

342
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:27,656
thing the other day?

343
00:12:27,656 --> 00:12:28,634
- You know what, I didn't see that.

344
00:12:28,634 --> 00:12:30,446
- That I loved.

345
00:12:30,446 --> 00:12:33,031
I was really into that, I was like, yes.

346
00:12:33,031 --> 00:12:35,425
Like, that's, now you're
starting to get into, like,

347
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:36,758
that next place.

348
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:38,648
I thought that was a really interesting

349
00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:39,705
kind of meme for data.

350
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:41,192
- You mean women that need touch-ups,

351
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:42,503
showing that, is that what you're?

352
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:44,816
- Women, just like, fuck it,
I'm not dying my hair anymore.

353
00:12:44,816 --> 00:12:45,869
I'm gray hair now, go.

354
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:47,092
- I don't agree with that at all.

355
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:48,445
- Yeah I understand.

356
00:12:48,445 --> 00:12:49,278
- My mom is there.

357
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:51,580
- My hair is white, my
hair is 100 percent white.

358
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,096
- Bobbi, can you do me a huge favor?

359
00:12:53,096 --> 00:12:53,929
- What?

360
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:55,359
- Can you just, for just one moment,

361
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,576
just go 100 percent white?

362
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,146
No, not be quiet, get louder.

363
00:12:58,146 --> 00:12:59,366
- I don't want to, why would I want to?

364
00:12:59,366 --> 00:13:00,849
- Just for me, just send it to me,

365
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:01,868
and then just dye your hair.

366
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:02,701
I just wanna see what it looks like.

367
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:04,307
I'm curious what the big,
the A B difference is.

368
00:13:04,307 --> 00:13:05,496
- I think it just makes you look older.

369
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:07,101
- Of course it does.

370
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:07,934
- But why?

371
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:08,829
- Well cooler.

372
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,705
- My mom has silver hair and
I just think it's gorgeous.

373
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:13,998
And I hope that I can, you
know, age that gracefully.

374
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:15,070
- [Bobbi] How old's your mom?

375
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,153
- She's 60, ma, yeah, she's 60, yeah.

376
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:20,240
- So that's your jam.

377
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,695
- So there's that, but I also
really vibe off of struggles.

378
00:13:23,695 --> 00:13:25,893
I think that people really
try to just be like,

379
00:13:25,893 --> 00:13:27,950
oh I have this perfect life on Instagram

380
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,031
and you know, I don't ever
go through any problems.

381
00:13:30,031 --> 00:13:32,044
But I feel like struggles
are what empower us,

382
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,283
what help us learn and
I feel like owning it,

383
00:13:34,283 --> 00:13:35,891
and being like, you know
what, I want through this shit

384
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:37,930
and I came out stronger because of it.

385
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,371
And not letting it drag you
down and not trying to hide it

386
00:13:40,371 --> 00:13:42,244
because I feel like, in
hiding your struggles,

387
00:13:42,244 --> 00:13:44,112
it almost, you let it overtake you.

388
00:13:44,112 --> 00:13:46,029
- [Gary] I totally, it has leverage.

389
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:47,835
- Right and it becomes
something much bigger

390
00:13:47,835 --> 00:13:49,136
than it needs to be,
when if you're just like,

391
00:13:49,136 --> 00:13:51,528
this is what I went through,

392
00:13:51,528 --> 00:13:53,690
you allow other people to
be like, I'm not alone,

393
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,478
I can connect on this and I can
get to where you're at, too.

394
00:13:57,478 --> 00:13:58,311
- [Gary] Men?

395
00:13:58,311 --> 00:14:02,846
- Men, yeah, so I think
with my 20 years experience,

396
00:14:02,846 --> 00:14:07,597
entrepreneurship, I want
to inspire the Millennials.

397
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,681
I think we have over 80
percent of our employees

398
00:14:10,681 --> 00:14:13,853
are Millennials and I want
to inspire them every day.

399
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:18,038
I think that is one of
the things I work hard for

400
00:14:18,038 --> 00:14:21,604
and the other ways I try to
build a foundation for my kids

401
00:14:21,604 --> 00:14:24,478
so they can have a good
life in the future.

402
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:26,153
- [Gary] Understood, my man?

403
00:14:26,153 --> 00:14:27,236
- Here, here.

404
00:14:28,756 --> 00:14:30,665
I think, it's, the
happiness part, I think,

405
00:14:30,665 --> 00:14:33,249
is great having this for
yourself, your family,

406
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:35,645
and employees and I think that's something

407
00:14:35,645 --> 00:14:36,607
relates well with Ralph said.

408
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:39,230
I think it's very
important, enjoy the ride.

409
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,881
And I think in any way and enjoy the ride,

410
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,300
and extend it and give that.

411
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,883
I think when we started, the three of us,

412
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:48,891
it was all like, anything
we do, but it should be fun.

413
00:14:48,891 --> 00:14:50,902
And that the fun part,
you can say, okay, fun,

414
00:14:50,902 --> 00:14:53,204
and that piece is, and it should be fun.

415
00:14:53,204 --> 00:14:55,675
And when somebody is
not happy, please leave.

416
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:58,327
And that's what, every week we tell this.

417
00:14:58,327 --> 00:14:59,369
- [Bobbi] Happiness is a choice.

418
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,054
- Yes, and you take that
happiness back home.

419
00:15:02,054 --> 00:15:04,639
You take the happiness back to work, and.

420
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,884
- [Gary] And it starts building momentum.

421
00:15:05,884 --> 00:15:07,639
- Exactly and we stay hungry of course.

422
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:11,391
Every day, it's building
global brands, that's it.

423
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:13,481
- Okay, we're gonna do this again.

424
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:17,251
This time, the non-horse shit
version, I'll start, right.

425
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:20,104
You guys gave me your
religion, your macro,

426
00:15:20,104 --> 00:15:23,562
super awesome, I enjoyed
it, I feel better than ever.

427
00:15:23,562 --> 00:15:25,420
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go more,

428
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,349
more practical slash literal.

429
00:15:28,349 --> 00:15:29,285
I'm gonna start again.

430
00:15:29,285 --> 00:15:30,875
What are you most obsessed with?

431
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:31,761
I'll go first.

432
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:33,802
I'm most obsessed with, right now,

433
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:37,687
the fact that Jordan, my
trainer, has this stick

434
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,498
and I didn't know about this
thing called tissue quality.

435
00:15:40,498 --> 00:15:42,299
But I've had a bad back for 20 years,

436
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:43,966
'cause I worked in a liquor store

437
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:46,015
and what actually was fucking me up is

438
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:48,216
right on my hip point, or right here,

439
00:15:48,216 --> 00:15:51,093
my tissue quality was so bad.

440
00:15:51,093 --> 00:15:53,786
And your brain actually
doesn't let you know.

441
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,742
I didn't know this, your
brain's protecting you

442
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:57,139
from your flaw.

443
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:02,139
So this stick, this plastic
stick is my current obsession.

444
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,679
Like, I'm obsessed with it,

445
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:06,711
because it's making my body feel better.

446
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:08,294
That, and broccoli,

447
00:16:09,526 --> 00:16:10,890
with lemon.

448
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,818
Something's happened.

449
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:14,730
I've always been a fairly
decent fan of broccoli,

450
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,100
but when you add lemon to it,

451
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,832
something weird happened to me.

452
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:21,383
About seven or eight weeks
ago, I added lemon weirdly,

453
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:23,253
'cause I think it was
from my seltzer water.

454
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:24,544
And I was like, whoa,

455
00:16:24,544 --> 00:16:26,776
fuckin' broccoli with lemon's different

456
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:29,154
and now I've been eating it a lot.

457
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,803
I'm currently obsessed
with broccoli with lemon.

458
00:16:31,803 --> 00:16:32,934
Bobbi, your turn.

459
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:34,494
- Okay, I'm not obsessed with broccoli,

460
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,627
but I could kill your broccoli with lemon.

461
00:16:36,627 --> 00:16:37,460
- Okay, good.

462
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,906
- I could chop it up and
put some garlic in it

463
00:16:38,906 --> 00:16:41,951
and kind of burn it and
you'll love my broccoli.

464
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:45,700
- But your current weird
obsession, like a TV show,

465
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,845
a video game you're playing, a new app,

466
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:50,280
some person that you've
been following hardcore

467
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,451
for the last three days and you're like,

468
00:16:51,451 --> 00:16:52,928
who the fuck is this person?

469
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,266
Something more nuanced,
day in and day out,

470
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:57,057
like, in our lives,
there's always something

471
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,785
that catches our attention.

472
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:01,617
Maybe the new jersey of a
team, changed their jersey,

473
00:17:01,617 --> 00:17:03,649
maybe wearing facial
hair for the first time,

474
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:06,598
like some sort of, like
more nuanced, interesting,

475
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:08,530
intriguing, real-life thing,

476
00:17:08,531 --> 00:17:11,078
not some altruistic mission,
fuckin' statement (laughter).

477
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:12,951
- Alright, for personally,
I'm trying to figure out

478
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:14,535
how I could take off 10 pounds.

479
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:17,915
I have to go on QVC to sell
some wellness supplements

480
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:19,830
and I gotta fuckin' take off 10 pounds.

481
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,189
- Okay first of all, that's crazy,

482
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,112
because if you're listening to this,

483
00:17:22,112 --> 00:17:23,269
Bobbi, you are not.

484
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:24,929
That doesn't seem real to me.

485
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:26,934
- But my pants, my jeans are tight on me.

486
00:17:26,934 --> 00:17:28,575
- Really?

487
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,558
Too many vodkas at night?

488
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:30,391
- I dunno.

489
00:17:30,391 --> 00:17:31,823
- They add up, those are
sneaky fucking calories.

490
00:17:31,823 --> 00:17:34,360
- I know, I put nuthin' else
in it, so maybe I need one.

491
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,028
- Olives can add up, too (laughs).

492
00:17:36,028 --> 00:17:37,678
- I know, I gave up olives for cucumbers.

493
00:17:37,678 --> 00:17:39,806
But I have a thing in my
closet, my size two jeans,

494
00:17:39,806 --> 00:17:40,639
I'm a small person.

495
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:41,472
- So why do you think they're tight,

496
00:17:41,472 --> 00:17:43,422
like what have you been
sneaking in the last,

497
00:17:43,422 --> 00:17:45,576
so like I know when I go a little high,

498
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:48,239
it's that I default back
to my old, old habits

499
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:50,177
from pre-three and a half years ago,

500
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:53,783
where I'll get tired,
which is weird for me,

501
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:56,595
about 15 hours into my
day of non-stop hustle.

502
00:17:56,595 --> 00:17:59,418
And I'll be like, fuck, I need some sugar,

503
00:17:59,418 --> 00:18:01,518
like I need a quick, like I'm
gonna eat this Snicker's bar

504
00:18:01,518 --> 00:18:04,017
that I just saw in that news
stand as I'm walkin' out

505
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:05,674
the airport, I'm gonna
eat the fuck out of it

506
00:18:05,674 --> 00:18:07,653
in a second and make
pretend I didn't eat it.

507
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,269
That, what are you doing
that you think is sneaking?

508
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:11,308
Or was it the holidays?

509
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:12,654
You just got caught by December?

510
00:18:12,654 --> 00:18:16,143
- No, no, I think it could
be I've launched a hotel,

511
00:18:16,143 --> 00:18:17,120
I've done all these things.

512
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,177
- No, no, but that's why.

513
00:18:19,177 --> 00:18:21,160
No, no what have you put in your body?

514
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,993
- I'm tellin' you,

515
00:18:21,993 --> 00:18:23,382
I don't nibble on French
fries, I don't eat anything.

516
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:24,296
- So then there's something else.

517
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:26,424
You've just not been
going to the gym as much.

518
00:18:26,424 --> 00:18:29,084
- Maybe I'm doing weights
and not as much cardio.

519
00:18:29,084 --> 00:18:31,853
I dunno, because I was just doing cardio

520
00:18:31,853 --> 00:18:33,796
and I switched to weights, I don't know.

521
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:35,452
- You know what I've
learned through Instagram?

522
00:18:35,452 --> 00:18:36,285
- Or maybe when you're 60,

523
00:18:36,285 --> 00:18:37,485
you just turn into a different body.

524
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:39,735
- Instagram has taught me,
because everybody's like

525
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:41,768
fitnessed out, aka, showing their butt,

526
00:18:41,768 --> 00:18:42,678
and so I'm like, oh, weird.

527
00:18:42,678 --> 00:18:45,748
And so like, is that it's not the weight,

528
00:18:45,748 --> 00:18:47,697
because so many people are
putting up those awesome photos

529
00:18:47,697 --> 00:18:52,410
I say to myself, I'm
heavier right now, I'm 171

530
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,123
compared to where I was
like 157 a little while ago.

531
00:18:55,123 --> 00:18:56,638
But because I'm adding so much muscle,

532
00:18:56,638 --> 00:18:57,865
it looks different.

533
00:18:57,865 --> 00:18:59,998
- My jeans are inside out in my closet,

534
00:18:59,998 --> 00:19:01,518
'cause when they don't
fit, I turn 'em inside out

535
00:19:01,518 --> 00:19:03,613
so I know what fits me so
it's easy to get dressed.

536
00:19:03,613 --> 00:19:06,098
80 percent of my jeans
are inside out right now.

537
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:06,931
- Respect.

538
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:07,764
- In a pile.

539
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:09,325
- Okay, your current
obsession is 10 pounds.

540
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:11,345
- My current obsession is 10 pounds.

541
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:13,139
- And what's your Twitter handle?

542
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:14,201
- Just Bobbi Brown.

543
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:16,388
- Just Bobbi Brown, okay
everybody who's listening,

544
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:20,101
go to Twitter right now,
hit up at Just Bobbi Brown

545
00:19:20,101 --> 00:19:21,585
and start encouraging her.

546
00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:22,530
- To not drink.

547
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,549
- And here's the other thing.

548
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:25,148
- No, but can you drink
and lose 10 pounds?

549
00:19:25,148 --> 00:19:27,144
- Bobbi, lemme finish
this, lemme finish this.

550
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:27,977
This is very important.

551
00:19:27,977 --> 00:19:29,109
- Sorry, Gary, no one ever
interrupts you, sorry.

552
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:32,138
- I'm doing the interrupting.

553
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,987
Every morning, I want you to ask Bobbi

554
00:19:33,987 --> 00:19:37,554
to take a picture of her
scale and share it on social.

555
00:19:37,554 --> 00:19:38,992
- No, because it's not
about what you weigh,

556
00:19:38,992 --> 00:19:39,825
it's how your jeans fit.

557
00:19:39,825 --> 00:19:40,981
- Peer pressure, it works.

558
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:42,675
Peer pressure makes people do shit.

559
00:19:42,675 --> 00:19:45,401
- The obsession is, can I drink
alcohol and lose 10 pounds.

560
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:46,459
That's all I wanna know.

561
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:47,992
- How much?

562
00:19:47,992 --> 00:19:48,825
- You tell me.

563
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:50,693
- No, she means how much alcohol.

564
00:19:50,693 --> 00:19:52,474
- I have one or two drinks a night

565
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:53,307
of vodka, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

566
00:19:53,307 --> 00:19:54,953
- That means four, for
everybody scoring at home.

567
00:19:54,953 --> 00:19:56,582
- I have the little bottles because

568
00:19:56,582 --> 00:19:57,990
that's how you drink in Montclair

569
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,415
'cause there's not a liquor licence.

570
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:01,218
- Montclair is such a fun town.

571
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:03,057
Montclair's got a different vibe.

572
00:20:03,057 --> 00:20:05,456
I think Montclair's
actually not a real town.

573
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:07,475
I feel like, I feel like
it's one of those places

574
00:20:07,475 --> 00:20:09,429
that has like the town, but underneath,

575
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:11,903
there's like casino, do
you know what I mean?

576
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,167
I feel like Montclair's
got like seven secret,

577
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:15,581
I feel like the hotel's a farce.

578
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,610
I bet you in the basement
of Bobbi's hotel,

579
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,264
there's some gangster shit going on.

580
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:21,097
Bobbi?

581
00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:22,347
- The hotel's not open yet, but no.

582
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,275
Montclair's a cool place.

583
00:20:23,275 --> 00:20:24,442
- Even better.

584
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,487
Let's go back to it, cucumbers,
this one weird account.

585
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:32,937
Watching 1984 sitcoms,
like what are you currently

586
00:20:32,937 --> 00:20:34,308
weirdly obsessed with?

587
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:35,530
- Are you ready for the eye rolls?

588
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,778
I know they're coming.

589
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:39,383
I'm obsessed with The Bachelor, obsessed.

590
00:20:39,383 --> 00:20:42,986
- That's good, thank you,
now we're getting somewhere.

591
00:20:42,986 --> 00:20:44,318
Ricky Van Veen, if you're listening.

592
00:20:44,318 --> 00:20:47,424
Ricky Van Veen, head of
content for Facebook,

593
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:51,016
one of my great, like just I
admire him, such a good dude.

594
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,852
He's obsessed with The Bachelor.

595
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,671
Like, I remember Southby
four years ago, he's like

596
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,546
we have to go to this weird
house and watch The Bachelor.

597
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,550
I'm like,

598
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,298
like in the outskirts of Austin,

599
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:01,390
we're goin' to a home and
watching The Bachelor?

600
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,223
He's like yes.

601
00:21:02,223 --> 00:21:03,056
- Was it a party, like a watching party?

602
00:21:03,056 --> 00:21:05,900
Yeah, Bachelor Nation (laughs).

603
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,645
- There's so many dudes
that love The Bachelor.

604
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:10,084
Anyway, nonetheless,
you love The Bachelor.

605
00:21:10,084 --> 00:21:11,322
Are we in the season right now?

606
00:21:11,322 --> 00:21:12,255
- We're in the season right now.

607
00:21:12,255 --> 00:21:13,144
- And who's the person?

608
00:21:13,144 --> 00:21:15,838
- Yes, so Ari, Ari is the guy

609
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:17,260
and he came back from a prior season.

610
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,827
- Oh, right, they're doin' the recall now.

611
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:21,366
- Yeah, they are, yeah,
but he's a good guy.

612
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:24,270
You know what, he's
really goofy, but he's so.

613
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,914
- Is he douchey?

614
00:21:25,914 --> 00:21:27,759
- He likes it because
he's a race car driver.

615
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,368
- Is he good-looking?
- [Luca] He is, yeah.

616
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:30,377
- Very?

617
00:21:30,377 --> 00:21:31,960
- [Anna] Very gray.

618
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:34,214
Yeah, race car driver and that's his jam.

619
00:21:34,214 --> 00:21:35,459
- Right, all you Europeans like,

620
00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:37,984
you know, the football
soccer thing I can deal with.

621
00:21:37,984 --> 00:21:41,210
That whole Formula One
bullshit, I'm out, I'm out.

622
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,966
- You're not Formula One, are you?

623
00:21:43,966 --> 00:21:46,046
- He loves fuckin' Formula One.

624
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:47,220
Do you hear his accent?

625
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,986
He fuckin' loves Formula One.

626
00:21:48,986 --> 00:21:50,361
- He doesn't love soccer though.

627
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:52,364
He's the only Italian on earth.

628
00:21:52,364 --> 00:21:54,117
He grew up, American football.

629
00:21:54,117 --> 00:21:55,486
- You love American football?

630
00:21:55,486 --> 00:21:57,600
I fuckin' love you for that.

631
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,850
Wow, the Internet is crazy.

632
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,876
- [Bobbi] And I hate The Bachelor.

633
00:22:02,876 --> 00:22:03,709
- Do you hate it?

634
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:04,724
- [Gary] Bobbi you hate it right?

635
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:06,621
- I like ballers.

636
00:22:06,621 --> 00:22:07,493
- [Ralph Juul] (in unison) Yes.

637
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,326
- I am obsessed with ballers.

638
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:09,159
- Oh, Ballers the rock show?

639
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:09,992
- [Anna] I haven't seen it.

640
00:22:09,992 --> 00:22:10,885
- Yes, obsessed, obsessed with Ballers.

641
00:22:10,885 --> 00:22:13,672
- [Gary] I need to be on that show.

642
00:22:13,672 --> 00:22:16,796
- Like Entourage I used
to love, love Ballers.

643
00:22:16,796 --> 00:22:18,219
- You're just such a dude.

644
00:22:18,219 --> 00:22:19,505
- Well, I have three sons and two nephews.

645
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,035
- You're a fuckin' dude.

646
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:21,958
I love that about you.

647
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,052
- So you love the luxury
Miami lifestyle, then.

648
00:22:23,052 --> 00:22:23,885
- I do.

649
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:24,938
- That's quite a conflicted.

650
00:22:24,938 --> 00:22:27,971
- Well, they drink cocktails.

651
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,263
- This is my problem with The Bachelor

652
00:22:29,263 --> 00:22:31,319
is I think that they're
getting more and more gimmicky

653
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,152
and it's getting more and more fake.

654
00:22:32,152 --> 00:22:32,985
- But you love it, you're obsessed.

655
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:34,550
- Yes and no but I wanna believe.

656
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,370
I wanna believe in the fairy tale

657
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,985
and they're making it hard.

658
00:22:37,985 --> 00:22:39,185
- You're living the fuckin' fairy tale.

659
00:22:39,185 --> 00:22:40,130
- I know, I know, I know.

660
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,721
- The fuck do you need
to believe anything,

661
00:22:41,721 --> 00:22:44,651
you're literally in the fairy
tale as we speak (laughter).

662
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:46,095
- I just feel like girls go on it now

663
00:22:46,095 --> 00:22:47,686
just to get insta famous.

664
00:22:47,686 --> 00:22:49,193
- As they should.

665
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:50,810
- Right, touché, absolutely.

666
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,286
- Right, like what the
fuck are we doin' out here,

667
00:22:52,286 --> 00:22:53,568
like get on The fuckin' Bachelor,

668
00:22:53,568 --> 00:22:55,818
get awareness, leverage it.

669
00:22:56,683 --> 00:22:59,121
You get lots of love
outside of The Bachelor

670
00:22:59,121 --> 00:23:00,994
with the leverage, right?

671
00:23:00,994 --> 00:23:01,827
- Right, right.

672
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:03,162
- Thank you, boys.

673
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:04,725
Real talk.

674
00:23:04,725 --> 00:23:06,705
Like the peanuts on British Airlines.

675
00:23:06,705 --> 00:23:08,310
Oh, tennis as a whole.

676
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,143
Playing or watching?

677
00:23:09,143 --> 00:23:10,043
- I'm very obsessed by tennis.

678
00:23:10,043 --> 00:23:11,003
- Playing or watching?

679
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:12,115
- Both, both.

680
00:23:12,115 --> 00:23:13,333
- Do you love, do you
just love Roger Federer?

681
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,222
- I played tennis, I think,

682
00:23:15,222 --> 00:23:17,388
over 40 years now, so a lot of time.

683
00:23:17,388 --> 00:23:18,579
- Do you love Roger Federer?

684
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:19,868
- Yeah, it's amazing.

685
00:23:19,868 --> 00:23:21,014
- Can I tell something
weird about Roger Federer

686
00:23:21,014 --> 00:23:22,175
that I have to admit to everybody?

687
00:23:22,175 --> 00:23:23,008
- [Ralph] Yeah.

688
00:23:23,008 --> 00:23:25,021
- I've hated Roger Federer my whole life

689
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:26,741
until this last weekend.

690
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:27,918
- 'Cause he cried?

691
00:23:27,918 --> 00:23:29,848
- No, because he's always
been good like that.

692
00:23:29,848 --> 00:23:32,975
Because he's the best
and I, when I don't care,

693
00:23:32,975 --> 00:23:35,064
I only root for underdogs.

694
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:36,548
And he's the best.

695
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:40,150
So I was just like,
fuck, I don't care slash

696
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,171
I respect the shit out of him.

697
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,952
And like, I didn't need him to cry.

698
00:23:43,952 --> 00:23:46,029
He's the, by the way, he's
the, like I've tried to do

699
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:47,309
a little bit of like, digging.

700
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:49,780
He's the best dude ever.

701
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,425
But I've like, kind of
like, done the whole comp,

702
00:23:51,425 --> 00:23:52,715
like I root for the underdogs,

703
00:23:52,715 --> 00:23:54,115
and plus I love Joker,

704
00:23:54,115 --> 00:23:55,232
like I'm a big Novak guy,

705
00:23:55,232 --> 00:23:58,296
'cause he's like, ridiculous
and like, I like that.

706
00:23:58,296 --> 00:24:01,204
But like, literally, he
made me submit this weekend.

707
00:24:01,204 --> 00:24:03,215
I'm like, this fuckin' guy.

708
00:24:03,215 --> 00:24:05,544
Like, he's such all-time.

709
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:08,119
Alright, your four favorite tennis players

710
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:09,655
over the last 40 years.

711
00:24:09,655 --> 00:24:11,487
- 40, John McEnroe.

712
00:24:11,487 --> 00:24:12,846
- Number, in order.

713
00:24:12,846 --> 00:24:13,963
- Oh, in order.

714
00:24:13,963 --> 00:24:15,369
- Not in order, just four.

715
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:17,588
- I think my best friend, David Ferrer.

716
00:24:17,588 --> 00:24:19,010
- [Gary] Okay.

717
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:21,526
- I know the guy for a couple
of years, very nice guy.

718
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:22,965
- [Gary] Okay, John McEnroe.

719
00:24:22,965 --> 00:24:23,798
- John McEnroe.

720
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:24,861
- [Gary] Why?

721
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:26,783
- Because his attitude, his.

722
00:24:26,783 --> 00:24:28,329
- And how old were you
when he was doin' his thing

723
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:29,475
in the late 70s, early 80s?

724
00:24:29,475 --> 00:24:30,613
- I was 12.

725
00:24:30,613 --> 00:24:34,323
- Exactly, perfect, so
you're like this badass guy.

726
00:24:34,323 --> 00:24:36,649
(crosstalk) got it, okay,
Mac, same for me, by the way,

727
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:38,463
I love him with all my heart.

728
00:24:38,463 --> 00:24:40,665
We need to get Mac on Pod Sessions.

729
00:24:40,665 --> 00:24:42,304
'Cause he like, yeah, I'm gonna get him.

730
00:24:42,304 --> 00:24:43,577
I love him, okay.

731
00:24:43,577 --> 00:24:44,435
- Agassi.

732
00:24:44,435 --> 00:24:45,268
- Agassi.

733
00:24:45,268 --> 00:24:46,101
- Yeah.

734
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:47,970
- Same, 'cause of the
attitude kinda thing?

735
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:48,803
Which Agassi, long hair
Agassi, or your hair Agassi?

736
00:24:48,803 --> 00:24:51,420
- I read his book, Open, I read his book.

737
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,003
No, the short hair.

738
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,237
And Serena Williams.

739
00:24:55,237 --> 00:24:57,190
- His book, his book, yeah
Serena's such a fuckin' beast.

740
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,023
- And Billie Jean King.

741
00:24:58,023 --> 00:24:58,856
- [Ralph] Yes.

742
00:24:58,856 --> 00:24:59,689
- How do you not love Billie Jean King?

743
00:24:59,689 --> 00:25:00,782
- He doesn't like Billie Jean King.

744
00:25:00,782 --> 00:25:02,012
- No, I don't know her.

745
00:25:02,012 --> 00:25:03,722
I never see play her, so.

746
00:25:03,722 --> 00:25:05,729
- Okay, I understand,
'cause that hit your radar.

747
00:25:05,729 --> 00:25:07,229
- No, I don't play tennis.

748
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:08,583
- No, I understand culturally though.

749
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:09,799
- No, but did you see the movie?

750
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,632
- I did.

751
00:25:10,632 --> 00:25:11,465
- Did you see the movie?

752
00:25:11,465 --> 00:25:12,928
What Billie Jean Kind
did for all of us women.

753
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:13,886
- She's so gangster.

754
00:25:13,886 --> 00:25:14,719
- Oh my gawd, she is.

755
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:15,673
- She's so gangster.

756
00:25:15,673 --> 00:25:16,506
- You have to see the movie.

757
00:25:16,506 --> 00:25:17,339
- You know who I loved?

758
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:18,613
Stefan Edberg.

759
00:25:18,613 --> 00:25:19,522
- [Ralph] Yeah.

760
00:25:19,522 --> 00:25:21,457
- I was such a big Stefan Edberg fan.

761
00:25:21,457 --> 00:25:22,900
- Sure, he's (mumbles) player.

762
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,474
One of the last, I think.

763
00:25:25,474 --> 00:25:26,900
- He was so, like, smooth.

764
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,394
He was McEnroe style.

765
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:30,124
I was a big Stefan Edberg fan.

766
00:25:30,124 --> 00:25:32,769
What about Boris Becker, when
he was 18 and won Wimbledon?

767
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:34,932
- He was 16, he won Wimbledon.

768
00:25:34,932 --> 00:25:36,125
- Was he that young?

769
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:38,857
- Almost 17, yeah, 16 and
nine months or something.

770
00:25:38,857 --> 00:25:42,867
- I think he was 17,
right, oh he was 16, huh.

771
00:25:42,867 --> 00:25:43,834
That was unbelievable.

772
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:44,868
You know who I hated?

773
00:25:44,868 --> 00:25:45,738
Ivan Lendl.

774
00:25:45,738 --> 00:25:46,635
You know why?

775
00:25:46,635 --> 00:25:48,315
'Cause he destroyed McEnroe.

776
00:25:48,315 --> 00:25:51,738
- You saw in Mexican,
Michael Chang, on (mumbles).

777
00:25:51,738 --> 00:25:53,233
- Well fuckin' Michael
Chang's French Open.

778
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:54,757
- He was surfing.

779
00:25:54,757 --> 00:25:56,632
- He was so fuckin' cramping.

780
00:25:56,632 --> 00:25:59,546
Michael Chang's calves were like the size

781
00:25:59,546 --> 00:26:01,296
of Ben's entire body.

782
00:26:02,515 --> 00:26:05,831
They were huge (laughter), they were huge,

783
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,369
seriously, Ben, they were huge.

784
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:09,680
Alright, let's move it on.

785
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,013
I wanna talk about SnapChat.

786
00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:15,460
The state of the union
of your SnapChat life.

787
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,625
- Mine's really quick, I follow my kids

788
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:19,163
to see what they're doin' and that's it.

789
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:20,738
- And are your kids behaving on there?

790
00:26:20,738 --> 00:26:22,612
Being ridiculous, what
are we seeing on there?

791
00:26:22,612 --> 00:26:25,815
- Yeah, they're ridiculously behaving.

792
00:26:25,815 --> 00:26:26,993
- Got it, they're like.

793
00:26:26,993 --> 00:26:28,250
- Just enough, they're
doing what they should be.

794
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,703
- Just enough that they
know that you're watching.

795
00:26:29,703 --> 00:26:31,163
- (crosstalk) (mumbles) content.

796
00:26:31,163 --> 00:26:32,043
- Exactly, yeah.

797
00:26:32,043 --> 00:26:33,659
- And they're goin' one-on-one
with the ridiculous shit.

798
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,119
- They look, yeah.

799
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,402
- Understood, Anna?

800
00:26:36,402 --> 00:26:39,033
- Yeah, so I, SnapChat was my jam,

801
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:40,747
when it, not right when it came out,

802
00:26:40,747 --> 00:26:42,973
but once it became a thing for
like, influencers to be on it

803
00:26:42,973 --> 00:26:44,854
and show, like, the more
real side of their life.

804
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,721
It really helped strengthen my brand

805
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:49,857
because it went from, here's
this girl on Instagram very.

806
00:26:49,857 --> 00:26:51,721
- Not a perfect picture slash real shit.

807
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:53,550
- Right, so, and then I began just like,

808
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,661
sharing my day-to-day, ups
and downs, people loved it.

809
00:26:56,661 --> 00:26:59,657
I have my Snap fam and
they are hard core loyal.

810
00:26:59,657 --> 00:27:02,314
Then, InstaStories came out,
and I was like, uh-uh, no,

811
00:27:02,314 --> 00:27:04,558
InstaStories, like I'm
staying with SnapChat,

812
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:06,160
like they're OG.

813
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,725
But no one's going on SnapChat anymore.

814
00:27:08,725 --> 00:27:11,804
It's diving, it's, and
that breaks my heart.

815
00:27:11,804 --> 00:27:13,727
- What are your views from its peak

816
00:27:13,727 --> 00:27:14,613
to where it is right now?

817
00:27:14,613 --> 00:27:16,724
- The most it had ever been was 40K.

818
00:27:16,724 --> 00:27:18,783
- You were getting 40K kinda
consistently for views.

819
00:27:18,783 --> 00:27:19,864
- And now it's at 20.

820
00:27:19,864 --> 00:27:20,697
- Got it.

821
00:27:20,697 --> 00:27:21,530
- And so.

822
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,727
- Now do you think that's
a chicken-and-egg game?

823
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:25,321
So for me, they haven't declined,
but they're not growing.

824
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:27,821
My 60, right, is staying firm,

825
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:31,501
because I'm not deciding that it's dead.

826
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:33,998
I'm still giving it its effort

827
00:27:33,998 --> 00:27:36,007
because the thing that I don't
think people understand is

828
00:27:36,007 --> 00:27:37,816
just like Instagram did something,

829
00:27:37,816 --> 00:27:40,213
tomorrow SnapChat could
come up with an update

830
00:27:40,213 --> 00:27:41,152
that changes the game.

831
00:27:41,152 --> 00:27:42,095
- [Anna] I hope they do.

832
00:27:42,095 --> 00:27:44,978
- Well I think one of the ways
to be strategic for you is

833
00:27:44,978 --> 00:27:47,071
what energy you're putting into it

834
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:50,079
needs to be thoughtful, or
doing a new kind of show on it,

835
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:52,284
or doing something altogether
different, that you don't do.

836
00:27:52,284 --> 00:27:54,643
You're not giving people
a reason to stay engaged.

837
00:27:54,643 --> 00:27:57,285
- So I'm still on Snap, I still.

838
00:27:57,285 --> 00:27:58,804
- Yeah, but I can see
that you're half pregnant.

839
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:02,101
- Well, it's because I use Snap, because

840
00:28:02,101 --> 00:28:04,508
when it will do the six
Snaps all the way through,

841
00:28:04,508 --> 00:28:06,236
I can save 'em, put 'em on Insta Stories,

842
00:28:06,236 --> 00:28:07,725
so now I'm just on both places.

843
00:28:07,725 --> 00:28:09,059
But that is giving people a reason

844
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:10,493
to no longer need to go to SnapChat.

845
00:28:10,493 --> 00:28:12,859
- I think, I think, I think
there's something to be said

846
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:13,953
right now for creatives

847
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:16,024
to be thoughtful about what to do on Snap,

848
00:28:16,024 --> 00:28:17,113
because if you download,

849
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:20,019
if you look at the top apps right now,

850
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:23,649
there's enormous amount of
attention under 25 on SnapChat.

851
00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:25,371
It's that everybody's checked out

852
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:28,581
with being creative on SnapChat.

853
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,426
I think there's a real, it's a white space

854
00:28:30,426 --> 00:28:32,420
because nobody, 'cause everybody's left,

855
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,070
or leaving or in the process
of leaving or half pregnant.

856
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,038
- In Europe, we see
that a lot of teenagers

857
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:39,075
are still using it.

858
00:28:39,075 --> 00:28:39,940
- Oh, it's huge.

859
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,839
- And they use it as a messenger app,

860
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:44,061
and not for the content, I think.

861
00:28:44,061 --> 00:28:45,713
- Because people are mailing it in,

862
00:28:45,713 --> 00:28:46,546
including us.

863
00:28:46,546 --> 00:28:47,876
We've like, started getting more serious

864
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:49,996
in the last week or two
about getting back to more

865
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:51,732
Snap native stuff.

866
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:53,154
Where are you guys with SnapChat?

867
00:28:53,154 --> 00:28:54,575
On both brands.

868
00:28:54,575 --> 00:28:56,619
I mean BALR's fuckin' brand should be

869
00:28:56,619 --> 00:28:58,304
super serious about it,

870
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:01,078
because 15 to 25 Europe is insane.

871
00:29:01,078 --> 00:29:03,585
- Right, at the point, we decided

872
00:29:03,585 --> 00:29:06,713
okay, guys, we definitely should

873
00:29:06,713 --> 00:29:08,598
come up with a strategy for SnapChat.

874
00:29:08,598 --> 00:29:10,324
Then Instagram Stories
came, and they said,

875
00:29:10,324 --> 00:29:12,535
okay, guys, for now, focus
now first on Instagram

876
00:29:12,535 --> 00:29:14,027
and actually, it was quite,

877
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:16,199
they were a little bit arrogant to us

878
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:18,693
when we reached out for
them to talk with them.

879
00:29:18,693 --> 00:29:20,048
It was, guys, difficult.

880
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:21,813
- But don't let emotion get
in the way of opportunity.

881
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:23,709
- No, that's true, there's
no doubt, I totally agree,

882
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:24,542
but this.

883
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:25,547
- Everybody shits on me in the beginning.

884
00:29:25,547 --> 00:29:28,942
- But this first, since
2018, it's again on the map,

885
00:29:28,942 --> 00:29:32,389
you know, especially because
we see so many teenagers

886
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:34,906
using it, SnapChat friends (mumbles)

887
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,310
wish each other Merry
Christmas, Happy New Year,

888
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,231
they use SnapChat, so there is something.

889
00:29:39,231 --> 00:29:42,071
- If BALR buys, creates cool filters

890
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:46,109
and puts them on top of every
high school in the U.K.,

891
00:29:46,109 --> 00:29:47,884
your brand will change (finger snap).

892
00:29:47,884 --> 00:29:49,467
- Yes, great, yeah.

893
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,459
- What is your favorite
song right this second?

894
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,726
Boys (finger snap).

895
00:29:56,726 --> 00:29:57,674
By the way, it can be an old-school.

896
00:29:57,674 --> 00:30:00,393
- Bruno Mars, I'm sorry, how bad is that?

897
00:30:00,393 --> 00:30:02,281
This second, just 'cause
I just saw the Grammys.

898
00:30:02,281 --> 00:30:04,300
He's so sweet and so, like, upbeat.

899
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,133
- Yeah, that was beautiful.

900
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:06,291
- He, ya know, he makes ya happy.

901
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:08,801
- Does he feel too much
like trying to be a

902
00:30:08,801 --> 00:30:11,093
direct replication of
Michael Jackson for you?

903
00:30:11,093 --> 00:30:11,926
- No.

904
00:30:11,926 --> 00:30:13,830
- Okay, just curious.

905
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,329
- Big Shot.

906
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:16,478
- [Bobbi] He's a little guy.

907
00:30:16,478 --> 00:30:17,533
- No, Big Shot.

908
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:19,008
- [Bobbi] Oh Big Shot,
that's his, oh sorry.

909
00:30:19,008 --> 00:30:21,524
- The song, Big Shot, you know it?

910
00:30:21,524 --> 00:30:22,357
I like that.

911
00:30:22,357 --> 00:30:23,195
- [Gary] You?

912
00:30:23,195 --> 00:30:25,230
- I'm (mumbles) listening
to I Wish You Were Here,

913
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,177
Pink Floyd.

914
00:30:26,177 --> 00:30:27,700
- Yeah, it's been a classic.

915
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,695
- This morning, I love it.

916
00:30:28,695 --> 00:30:29,992
- Yeah, Cardi B.

917
00:30:29,992 --> 00:30:31,547
- Cardi B, she's inspiring you

918
00:30:31,547 --> 00:30:33,107
with her just raw authenticity?

919
00:30:33,107 --> 00:30:35,210
- Yeah, absolutely, exactly, yeah.

920
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,764
Her authenticity and you know, her music

921
00:30:37,764 --> 00:30:40,939
is, I have no rhythm, so I
can't dance to it or anything,

922
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,606
but I can listen to it and in my head,

923
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:46,316
you know, working out at
least get into the zone, so.

924
00:30:46,316 --> 00:30:47,624
- And who's the new girl from New Jersey,

925
00:30:47,624 --> 00:30:48,703
what's her name?

926
00:30:48,703 --> 00:30:50,559
It's like S, c'mon you guys know.

927
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,392
She just won.

928
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,390
- [Juul] Yeah, like three letter.

929
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,971
- I don't wanna say it the wrong, SZA.

930
00:30:53,971 --> 00:30:55,614
- SZA, she's awesome, she's not that new.

931
00:30:55,614 --> 00:30:56,948
- Yeah, she's New Jersey, well she's.

932
00:30:56,948 --> 00:30:57,881
- New to you,

933
00:30:57,881 --> 00:30:59,042
'cause you're a Grammy audience.

934
00:30:59,042 --> 00:31:02,512
- My husband had her on his
homepage, though, he found her.

935
00:31:02,512 --> 00:31:03,345
- Really?

936
00:31:03,345 --> 00:31:04,386
- And likes her music, yeah.

937
00:31:04,386 --> 00:31:06,553
Usually I listen to
Biggie, that's my favorite.

938
00:31:06,553 --> 00:31:07,386
- Do you love him?

939
00:31:07,386 --> 00:31:08,219
- I love Biggie.

940
00:31:08,219 --> 00:31:09,198
- Do you think he just
painted the best picture.

941
00:31:09,198 --> 00:31:12,762
- I actually met his daughter
and his ex-wife on Instagram,

942
00:31:12,762 --> 00:31:14,958
and they came to my office,

943
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,649
and I did an interview with them.

944
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:17,921
Honestly, they're really cool.

945
00:31:17,921 --> 00:31:19,789
- No, I get it, it's fuckin' awesome.

946
00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:23,250
I think Biggie's ability to
paint such clean pictures

947
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,358
is what made him so special.

948
00:31:24,358 --> 00:31:26,476
To me, with music, I
don't think I'm musical.

949
00:31:26,476 --> 00:31:28,145
Like, I don't understand
beats and rhythms,

950
00:31:28,145 --> 00:31:31,350
like, I don't get excited about music.

951
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,388
I'm obsessed with lyrics.

952
00:31:33,388 --> 00:31:35,284
Like, I need the stories,

953
00:31:35,284 --> 00:31:36,758
people that tell the truth.

954
00:31:36,758 --> 00:31:37,633
That's why I love hip-hop.

955
00:31:37,633 --> 00:31:39,414
Hip-hop so skews to like,

956
00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:41,051
especially their first album.

957
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:43,048
The first album's the best, almost always,

958
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:45,839
'cause it's like, it's the origin story.

959
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,652
It's the first edition
of the comic, right.

960
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:49,001
- Flo Rida.

961
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:50,937
I'm sorry I danced on stage
with Flo Rida. (laughter)

962
00:31:50,937 --> 00:31:51,806
- Was that a big moment for you?

963
00:31:51,806 --> 00:31:53,955
- Oh my gawd, almost as
good as Salt 'n Pepa,

964
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:55,379
I danced on stage with them, too.

965
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:56,807
And Jewish women can't dance.

966
00:31:56,807 --> 00:31:58,046
- That is true, that is a fact.

967
00:31:58,046 --> 00:32:00,697
- But I did, so, yeah.

968
00:32:00,697 --> 00:32:02,197
- So what are you,

969
00:32:03,112 --> 00:32:04,831
what are you most

970
00:32:04,831 --> 00:32:08,433
curious about right now
in the way you're thinking

971
00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:09,597
about your businesses?

972
00:32:09,597 --> 00:32:13,321
Like, what, like what's the
unlock that you're looking for?

973
00:32:13,321 --> 00:32:14,630
What's kind of the hurdle

974
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,106
you're trying to jump over right now?

975
00:32:16,106 --> 00:32:19,171
Obviously, there's a lotta
success at this table

976
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:20,986
in a lotta different ways.

977
00:32:20,986 --> 00:32:22,382
So you're in it, right now,

978
00:32:22,382 --> 00:32:25,107
you know, you're in different chapters.

979
00:32:25,107 --> 00:32:26,522
You're in different parts of the success

980
00:32:26,522 --> 00:32:27,929
that you're actually living.

981
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:30,949
What's the hurdle you're trying to

982
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,366
really get over on right now?

983
00:32:34,873 --> 00:32:36,145
BALR?

984
00:32:36,145 --> 00:32:38,448
- Other markets, you know, we're

985
00:32:38,448 --> 00:32:41,531
got big in Europe yet, U.S. is for us

986
00:32:42,486 --> 00:32:43,626
always top five country,

987
00:32:43,626 --> 00:32:46,253
but the really serious

988
00:32:46,253 --> 00:32:50,350
getting big, for instance,
in Americas or in Asia.

989
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,307
And maintaining it.

990
00:32:51,307 --> 00:32:52,957
- For both 433 or from BALR?

991
00:32:52,957 --> 00:32:54,780
- Oh sorry, that's BALR,
that's BALR, yes, that's right.

992
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,323
And 433, oh U.S. is
number one followers base.

993
00:32:57,323 --> 00:33:00,656
So that's, for BALR, it's getting big in

994
00:33:02,028 --> 00:33:03,602
other parts of the world.

995
00:33:03,602 --> 00:33:05,602
And for 433 is, I think,

996
00:33:07,702 --> 00:33:10,617
stay big, become bigger and monetize

997
00:33:10,617 --> 00:33:13,099
in a really user-friendly way.

998
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:15,696
And relevant, stay relevant.

999
00:33:15,696 --> 00:33:17,346
I think that's it, that's maybe it.

1000
00:33:17,346 --> 00:33:18,312
- [Gary] Fair enough, Anna?

1001
00:33:18,312 --> 00:33:20,549
- Yeah, I would say,
even stemming off of our

1002
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:22,616
meeting about a week
and a half ago, is just.

1003
00:33:22,616 --> 00:33:23,632
- How great was that meeting?

1004
00:33:23,632 --> 00:33:24,980
- It was amazing.

1005
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,140
- Did you leave here and say, holy shit?

1006
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,031
- [Luca] Holy shit, yeah.

1007
00:33:29,031 --> 00:33:31,286
- He's even better looking and smart,

1008
00:33:31,286 --> 00:33:33,496
and smarter in real life (laughter).

1009
00:33:33,496 --> 00:33:34,329
- [Luca] Absolutely.

1010
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:35,485
- That's what you left with, right?

1011
00:33:35,485 --> 00:33:36,937
Good, team right, right.

1012
00:33:36,937 --> 00:33:38,611
- You guys all have man
crushes on each other.

1013
00:33:38,611 --> 00:33:41,679
(laughter).

1014
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,809
- Was it on a podcast or on a video?

1015
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:45,298
- It was video, we did podcast and video,

1016
00:33:45,298 --> 00:33:46,484
by the way, I was super stoked.

1017
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:47,656
I was so stoked.

1018
00:33:47,656 --> 00:33:48,542
Fangirling.

1019
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:51,553
So, yeah, just expanding so that I can

1020
00:33:51,553 --> 00:33:54,096
take all the little tedious
things off my shoulders,

1021
00:33:54,096 --> 00:33:56,801
so I can just focus on connecting.

1022
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:57,910
- Have you guys made progress?

1023
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,743
- [Luca] Yes.

1024
00:33:58,743 --> 00:33:59,576
- Mentally, for sure.

1025
00:33:59,576 --> 00:34:00,487
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1026
00:34:00,487 --> 00:34:04,705
And there's that, I also
find, you know, just

1027
00:34:04,705 --> 00:34:06,355
still standing out, you know,

1028
00:34:06,355 --> 00:34:08,971
and reaching a bigger market.

1029
00:34:08,971 --> 00:34:10,049
There's so many fitness (crosstalk) now.

1030
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:11,357
- Can I ask you a question?

1031
00:34:11,357 --> 00:34:12,635
That I actually really think is important

1032
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:13,974
for a lot of people to hear.

1033
00:34:13,974 --> 00:34:18,364
How do you deal with being
a pretty girl on Instagram?

1034
00:34:18,364 --> 00:34:21,084
Like how much, you know, how much

1035
00:34:21,085 --> 00:34:24,112
in the DM, like how
much of like, you know,

1036
00:34:24,112 --> 00:34:26,615
the dude stuff that
unfortunately comes along

1037
00:34:26,616 --> 00:34:27,949
with dude's DNA.

1038
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:30,567
Like, to me, you know,

1039
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:32,356
when I'm trying to help people persevere

1040
00:34:32,356 --> 00:34:36,189
and put into context
trolls, hate, negativity,

1041
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:40,005
there is an absolute different
game for men and women

1042
00:34:40,005 --> 00:34:42,237
and then there's a totally
different game for like

1043
00:34:42,237 --> 00:34:45,145
attractive, attractive
girls on the platform.

1044
00:34:45,146 --> 00:34:47,092
Like, how are you, what's goin,

1045
00:34:47,092 --> 00:34:47,925
where are you at with that?

1046
00:34:47,926 --> 00:34:48,931
- So I'm gonna tell you, first of all,

1047
00:34:48,931 --> 00:34:49,909
my female to male ratios.

1048
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:51,411
- Like there's disgusting shit

1049
00:34:51,411 --> 00:34:53,661
and disrespectful shit and.

1050
00:34:55,047 --> 00:34:56,226
- I just get kinda numb to it.

1051
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:57,864
I just immediately delete, block,

1052
00:34:57,864 --> 00:35:00,548
but I have an 83 percent female audience

1053
00:35:00,548 --> 00:35:01,704
and I'm very proud of that,

1054
00:35:01,704 --> 00:35:03,060
'cause that's almost unheard of

1055
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,696
for a female fitness influencer.

1056
00:35:04,696 --> 00:35:06,110
And the reason why is because

1057
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,024
A, I don't post T&A, or at least,

1058
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:09,185
not to where it crosses the line

1059
00:35:09,185 --> 00:35:12,580
of where this is no longer fitness.

1060
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,892
- That is, by the way, like
as soon as you said that,

1061
00:35:13,892 --> 00:35:15,567
literally I was almost about
to look at your account.

1062
00:35:15,567 --> 00:35:18,299
I'm like, there's only one way to do it.

1063
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:20,270
And it's just the Mendoza line of

1064
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,726
of how much skin you show.

1065
00:35:21,726 --> 00:35:23,628
- Right and it sucks
because I don't, you know,

1066
00:35:23,628 --> 00:35:26,001
women can also be empowered by

1067
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:28,226
you know, their sexuality,
but it's like, but then

1068
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,059
you're inviting.

1069
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:29,892
- Do you ever throw that curve ball?

1070
00:35:29,892 --> 00:35:31,230
Do you ever go further once in a blue moon

1071
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,816
because you're trying to mix it up?

1072
00:35:32,816 --> 00:35:34,222
- No, I definitely don't wanna mix it up.

1073
00:35:34,222 --> 00:35:35,552
- Because you don't wanna
deal with the ramifications?

1074
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,411
- Exactly, any time I get a guy

1075
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:39,190
that comments something vulgar,

1076
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,181
immediately delete and block.

1077
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:41,542
I don't want that as a follower.

1078
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:43,888
I don't want other women to
have to see that on my page.

1079
00:35:43,888 --> 00:35:45,886
I'm not interested in
having male followers

1080
00:35:45,886 --> 00:35:48,286
unless they are there for
genuine fitness inspiration.

1081
00:35:48,286 --> 00:35:49,119
- [Gary] Interesting.

1082
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,641
- So I, and another thing I've done

1083
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:51,474
is I've intentionally.

1084
00:35:51,474 --> 00:35:54,078
- So that's made it easy-er.

1085
00:35:54,078 --> 00:35:55,512
Then it's just DM that you
have to kind of deal with.

1086
00:35:55,512 --> 00:35:56,989
- Right, exactly.

1087
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,844
I also talk in a very
girly tone, on purpose,

1088
00:35:59,844 --> 00:36:01,953
because I want all of my references is,

1089
00:36:01,953 --> 00:36:04,636
hey girls, you know, if
some guys genuinely comment,

1090
00:36:04,636 --> 00:36:05,861
they're like, hey, some guys follow you

1091
00:36:05,861 --> 00:36:07,263
for motivation too, and I reply to them,

1092
00:36:07,263 --> 00:36:09,188
like thank you, I appreciate that.

1093
00:36:09,188 --> 00:36:10,633
- Well, listen, I mean,
I think Alyssa and I know

1094
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:11,813
this is a guy and having guy friends.

1095
00:36:11,813 --> 00:36:15,006
A lot of guys also use
some of them as motivation

1096
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,336
for their significant others.

1097
00:36:16,336 --> 00:36:17,169
- Exactly.

1098
00:36:17,169 --> 00:36:18,237
- Like, a lot more than people realize,

1099
00:36:18,237 --> 00:36:19,466
like, not all dudes are horrible.

1100
00:36:19,466 --> 00:36:21,835
Like, there's a lot of,
like interesting kind of,

1101
00:36:21,835 --> 00:36:23,803
like, I've been seeing that micro trend.

1102
00:36:23,803 --> 00:36:26,350
And that's a scary line to go as a guy,

1103
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,454
if you have a girlfriend
or a wife and be like,

1104
00:36:27,454 --> 00:36:28,423
hey, check out this girl.

1105
00:36:28,423 --> 00:36:31,183
Like, you know, that's a place
most guys aren't gonna go,

1106
00:36:31,183 --> 00:36:33,540
but it's interesting to
watch the world evolve

1107
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,847
in many different ways.

1108
00:36:34,847 --> 00:36:36,554
Anyway, nonetheless, so
that's that answer I guess.

1109
00:36:36,554 --> 00:36:38,794
- Yep, that's the answer,
I just have been super

1110
00:36:38,794 --> 00:36:41,632
hard core intentional about
I don't want a male audience

1111
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:43,272
or a minimal one, you know,

1112
00:36:43,272 --> 00:36:45,930
ones that are there for,
you know, genuine reasons.

1113
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,327
I, at the time, though my whole,

1114
00:36:47,327 --> 00:36:50,002
he was with me pre-Instagram
by the way (laughs).

1115
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:51,276
And you know.

1116
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:53,126
- You're a great dude. (laughter)

1117
00:36:53,126 --> 00:36:54,863
- Well a lot of people,
I get asked a lot like,

1118
00:36:54,863 --> 00:36:56,449
well, when did you guys actually meet,

1119
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:57,864
like did he meet you after Instagram?

1120
00:36:57,864 --> 00:36:59,200
'Cause then people think it's, you know,

1121
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,078
it's a different thing, and so.

1122
00:37:02,078 --> 00:37:03,412
So, yeah, just being intentional.

1123
00:37:03,412 --> 00:37:04,999
- Very cool, Bobbi, what are you,

1124
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:08,046
you know, all these
years in corporate land.

1125
00:37:08,046 --> 00:37:10,175
How long did it take you to get back

1126
00:37:10,175 --> 00:37:13,279
to the pre-corporate Bobbi
that made you so special?

1127
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:15,489
Your personality and who you are is that,

1128
00:37:15,489 --> 00:37:16,322
but on the professional side?

1129
00:37:16,322 --> 00:37:17,738
- Couple weeks, no, I
mean, a couple weeks.

1130
00:37:17,738 --> 00:37:19,680
- It took you a couple weeks,
right, to like defrag right?

1131
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,650
- I had a couple weeks and
I started doing things but

1132
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,400
for me, you know, I built
a billion dollar brand,

1133
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,525
but I had a giant team.

1134
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:30,885
Now, I'm rebuilding this
new brand with three people

1135
00:37:30,885 --> 00:37:34,072
and it's insane, it's insane.

1136
00:37:34,072 --> 00:37:36,319
And it's just, it's really
cool and I'm a product person

1137
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:39,693
so I make products and I sell products.

1138
00:37:39,693 --> 00:37:42,209
That's my brand, and you
know, different things,

1139
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:45,361
and it's gonna be an interesting journey,

1140
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:49,238
but after having success,
I really love the journey,

1141
00:37:49,238 --> 00:37:51,449
more than getting there,
'cause once you're there,

1142
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:53,821
you're like, oh shit, now what?

1143
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:54,928
So and I will never, yeah.

1144
00:37:54,928 --> 00:37:57,820
- When I buy the Jets, Bobbi,
I'm gonna cry out of sadness.

1145
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,043
(laughter).

1146
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,651
No the journey, man, I fuckin' love it.

1147
00:38:01,651 --> 00:38:03,026
Like, I love it.

1148
00:38:03,026 --> 00:38:04,545
- And then you're stuck
with trying to figure out

1149
00:38:04,545 --> 00:38:05,862
what to do, but

1150
00:38:05,862 --> 00:38:08,132
I will never, ever, ever sell my company

1151
00:38:08,132 --> 00:38:09,222
and stay with it again.

1152
00:38:09,222 --> 00:38:10,313
- Good for you.

1153
00:38:10,313 --> 00:38:12,158
Alright, let's do Q&A
session, for all of us,

1154
00:38:12,158 --> 00:38:13,156
for each other, even the people

1155
00:38:13,156 --> 00:38:16,194
that are hanging around outside of us.

1156
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:18,707
Guys, what kinda questions,
based on me or them

1157
00:38:18,707 --> 00:38:20,810
or just a general question, like,

1158
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,180
what about a little Q&A session?

1159
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,107
This could be a fun little format.

1160
00:38:24,107 --> 00:38:24,940
- I think,

1161
00:38:26,134 --> 00:38:28,666
a question where I'm thinking a lot about

1162
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:32,030
is the next steps Instagram will take

1163
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,874
about e-commerce.

1164
00:38:33,874 --> 00:38:35,549
- Right, what's gonna happen
with shopping inside Instagram?

1165
00:38:35,549 --> 00:38:36,583
- Yes.

1166
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:38,320
- Well, I'll give you
a very simple answer.

1167
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,575
It's gonna be a humongous fuckin' deal.

1168
00:38:40,575 --> 00:38:42,303
There's gonna be, all this game is,

1169
00:38:42,303 --> 00:38:44,009
is about lack of friction.

1170
00:38:44,009 --> 00:38:46,150
The things that I believe in
create the least friction,

1171
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:49,362
right, it's just all
about lack of friction.

1172
00:38:49,362 --> 00:38:50,195
Alexa.

1173
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:54,212
Alexa, buy a purse.

1174
00:38:56,898 --> 00:38:58,431
- Did you want me to find a purse?

1175
00:38:58,431 --> 00:38:59,264
- Yes.

1176
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:01,632
- One moment.

1177
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,191
- To me, what's so interesting is,

1178
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:04,559
I dunno how many seconds in we're now,

1179
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:05,532
probably seven or eight.

1180
00:39:05,532 --> 00:39:07,482
Alexa, buy this.

1181
00:39:07,482 --> 00:39:10,422
I just bought a $36 dollar purse, right.

1182
00:39:10,422 --> 00:39:11,628
- Order placed.

1183
00:39:11,628 --> 00:39:16,128
- Alexa, we meant Hermes. (laughter).

1184
00:39:17,281 --> 00:39:20,132
- I didn't find anything for
meant Hermes. (laughter).

1185
00:39:20,132 --> 00:39:21,313
- Alexa's got a little way to go.

1186
00:39:21,313 --> 00:39:23,093
Alexa, thank you, stop, Alexa, stop.

1187
00:39:23,093 --> 00:39:25,379
So here's, here's what I think.

1188
00:39:25,379 --> 00:39:26,641
I think lack of friction.

1189
00:39:26,641 --> 00:39:29,019
The fact that I just
bought a $36 dollar purse

1190
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:30,916
in one second (snaps
fingers), nine seconds, 11,

1191
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:33,303
whatever the math will show.

1192
00:39:33,303 --> 00:39:34,649
That is remarkable.

1193
00:39:34,649 --> 00:39:36,681
Like, forget about e-commerce.

1194
00:39:36,681 --> 00:39:39,171
That machine right there is remarkable.

1195
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:40,649
When you're in your Instagram feed,

1196
00:39:40,649 --> 00:39:42,529
which so many people live in now.

1197
00:39:42,529 --> 00:39:44,504
It is an absolute place of consumption.

1198
00:39:44,504 --> 00:39:46,741
And we're all inspired
and see different things.

1199
00:39:46,741 --> 00:39:47,902
The lack of friction, I mean,

1200
00:39:47,902 --> 00:39:49,847
when thinking about all three of you,

1201
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:51,444
and me too, I mean, you know,

1202
00:39:51,444 --> 00:39:55,605
I, Crushing It! is doing
real damage right now.

1203
00:39:55,605 --> 00:39:56,438
Andy K.

1204
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:57,371
Can we get Andy K, is he here?

1205
00:39:57,371 --> 00:39:59,627
- Right behind you. (laughter)

1206
00:39:59,627 --> 00:40:00,942
- By the way, for everybody
who doesn't have the visual,

1207
00:40:00,942 --> 00:40:02,482
Andy K's sitting right behind me.

1208
00:40:02,482 --> 00:40:03,315
- [Juul] He's faster than Alexa.

1209
00:40:03,315 --> 00:40:05,164
- Yeah, he's even,
Andy's faster than Alexa.

1210
00:40:05,164 --> 00:40:06,940
Andy, give us a little update on like,

1211
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,675
some of the stuff you,
gimme a metric or two

1212
00:40:08,675 --> 00:40:09,578
to share with the audience.

1213
00:40:09,578 --> 00:40:12,605
We're running Instagram ads
right now, for Crushing It!

1214
00:40:12,605 --> 00:40:15,926
Gimme something that's just
like a ludicrous data point.

1215
00:40:15,926 --> 00:40:17,083
- [Andy] Facebook ads were crazy,

1216
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:19,484
we were getting three
cent clicks at scale.

1217
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:21,886
- So like three cents to
get somebody to click,

1218
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:23,486
to show indication of buying the books.

1219
00:40:23,486 --> 00:40:24,566
Now, not everybody will covert and

1220
00:40:24,566 --> 00:40:27,743
if one of 30 do, it costs
$0.90 cents to get a sale.

1221
00:40:27,743 --> 00:40:29,403
These are staggering numbers for people

1222
00:40:29,403 --> 00:40:30,866
that are actual transactors.

1223
00:40:30,866 --> 00:40:33,779
Gimme some sort of fun
Instagram consumption thing or

1224
00:40:33,779 --> 00:40:35,284
something that's interesting.

1225
00:40:35,284 --> 00:40:36,814
Okay, Andy's pulling that up.

1226
00:40:36,814 --> 00:40:38,652
Here's what, here's what I think.

1227
00:40:38,652 --> 00:40:40,969
When Instagram and when all of them,

1228
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:44,655
Twitter, YouTube, as we
start integrating commerce,

1229
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:47,930
you've done it, kind
of like outside of it.

1230
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,675
I've done it outside of it.

1231
00:40:49,675 --> 00:40:51,607
Everybody here is actually
doing it outside of it,

1232
00:40:51,607 --> 00:40:53,091
which is, we're creating
brand in Instagram,

1233
00:40:53,091 --> 00:40:54,360
we're leveraging that attention

1234
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,941
to create transaction outside
which creates friction.

1235
00:40:57,941 --> 00:40:59,784
When this is just default in there,

1236
00:40:59,784 --> 00:41:01,465
and you see somebody
wearing something awesome

1237
00:41:01,465 --> 00:41:03,670
and you just hit a button,
and you've just bought it,

1238
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,679
it's gonna go to the moon.

1239
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:07,754
You're gonna have a conversion
rate dramatically higher

1240
00:41:07,754 --> 00:41:09,680
than like, oh, lemme go to BALR's website,

1241
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,548
oh the links in the profile,

1242
00:41:11,548 --> 00:41:14,032
that's friction, friction,
friction, friction, friction.

1243
00:41:14,032 --> 00:41:16,648
And why I'm obsessed with Alexa, right,

1244
00:41:16,648 --> 00:41:17,481
and devices like that

1245
00:41:17,481 --> 00:41:19,387
is that they're gonna eliminate friction.

1246
00:41:19,387 --> 00:41:22,095
Everything that eliminates
friction has upside.

1247
00:41:22,095 --> 00:41:24,126
Uber eliminated friction which is why

1248
00:41:24,126 --> 00:41:26,577
you're willing to overpay
for transportation.

1249
00:41:26,577 --> 00:41:31,060
Friction is the enemy,
period, end of story, right.

1250
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,465
Netflix eliminated friction,

1251
00:41:32,465 --> 00:41:34,359
by allowing you to binge watch

1252
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:37,223
because that's what you
actually wanted to do.

1253
00:41:37,223 --> 00:41:39,017
So that's all I ever think about,

1254
00:41:39,017 --> 00:41:40,619
getting to the heart of it, so

1255
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:41,814
what do I think about it?

1256
00:41:41,814 --> 00:41:45,318
It's going to be the
whole kit and kaboodle.

1257
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:48,624
And you should be practicing for it now.

1258
00:41:48,624 --> 00:41:49,461
And what does that mean?

1259
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:52,174
That means taking photos now
that are already thinking

1260
00:41:52,174 --> 00:41:53,660
what if?

1261
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,243
And seeing how they interact
and things of that nature.

1262
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,091
- [Andy] Less than half a penny

1263
00:42:00,091 --> 00:42:02,001
to watch 95 percent of one
of your videos on Instagram.

1264
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:02,905
- Damn.

1265
00:42:02,905 --> 00:42:04,534
- So I have a video right now
that we're running an ad on,

1266
00:42:04,534 --> 00:42:06,059
which is building brand awareness,

1267
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:08,911
that we're spending less than half a penny

1268
00:42:08,911 --> 00:42:12,444
to get somebody to watch
95 percent of that video.

1269
00:42:12,444 --> 00:42:13,277
- [Andy] Correct.

1270
00:42:13,277 --> 00:42:14,278
- Which video is that?

1271
00:42:14,278 --> 00:42:15,701
- [Andy] It's with you and The Rock.

1272
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:17,132
- With me and The Rock.

1273
00:42:17,132 --> 00:42:19,403
- I'd buy that book.

1274
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,202
- He's so manly, huh.

1275
00:42:21,202 --> 00:42:22,668
Fuck.

1276
00:42:22,668 --> 00:42:24,314
If was The Rock, I'd be so big.

1277
00:42:24,314 --> 00:42:26,150
(laughter).

1278
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,525
- Okay, influence marketing.

1279
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:29,534
And a lot of people call
themselves bloggers,

1280
00:42:29,534 --> 00:42:30,878
or floggers, et cetera.

1281
00:42:30,878 --> 00:42:33,315
And they all wanna be commercial,

1282
00:42:33,315 --> 00:42:36,055
so how do you see the
future for most of these

1283
00:42:36,055 --> 00:42:37,798
floggers and bloggers?

1284
00:42:37,798 --> 00:42:39,220
- I think there's a long tail.

1285
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,384
That's why I wrote Crushing It!

1286
00:42:40,384 --> 00:42:43,557
I think a lot, I don't
think, listen, I think, I,

1287
00:42:43,557 --> 00:42:45,399
if I was a full time influencer,

1288
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:47,572
could make $40 to $60
million dollars a year

1289
00:42:47,572 --> 00:42:49,392
being Gary V, I really believe that.

1290
00:42:49,392 --> 00:42:51,352
And then I think there's
people that can make

1291
00:42:51,352 --> 00:42:54,321
$40 to $60 dollars, $40 to $60 thousand,

1292
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,955
$400 to $600 thousand.

1293
00:42:55,955 --> 00:42:58,872
I think the market corrects itself,

1294
00:43:00,007 --> 00:43:01,626
but here's why I'm so happy.

1295
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:02,459
You're thinking about it,

1296
00:43:02,459 --> 00:43:03,665
what's in it for your brand right now,

1297
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:05,203
like is this the right person to pay.

1298
00:43:05,203 --> 00:43:06,693
I'm thinking about it the other way.

1299
00:43:06,693 --> 00:43:09,892
Can you imagine a woman
living in Scotland right now

1300
00:43:09,892 --> 00:43:11,711
who loves gardening.

1301
00:43:11,711 --> 00:43:13,601
And she's great at it,
she's been gardening

1302
00:43:13,601 --> 00:43:15,819
for fuckin' 49 years.

1303
00:43:15,819 --> 00:43:17,701
And as long as she can start understanding

1304
00:43:17,701 --> 00:43:19,962
how modern consumption
happens between YouTube,

1305
00:43:19,962 --> 00:43:23,528
a podcast, Instagram,
that nobody can pick her.

1306
00:43:23,528 --> 00:43:26,145
That she can go to the
market and slowly but surely

1307
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,491
build an audience, and get into a place

1308
00:43:28,491 --> 00:43:32,301
where instead of making
54 thousand Euros a year

1309
00:43:32,301 --> 00:43:35,421
being a secretary, or making
$500,000 dollars a year

1310
00:43:35,421 --> 00:43:37,150
owning her own shop,

1311
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,752
she can make $501,000 being a gardener,

1312
00:43:39,752 --> 00:43:42,105
or $54,000 dollars, or, by the way,

1313
00:43:42,105 --> 00:43:43,665
do you know, everybody
listening right now,

1314
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:46,621
if they had to take 10
percent less in income

1315
00:43:46,621 --> 00:43:50,047
but do the thing that they
do when they wanna do it,

1316
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:52,636
like, you know, tennis.

1317
00:43:52,636 --> 00:43:54,979
I would like to make the
argument that if you could make

1318
00:43:54,979 --> 00:43:57,418
$1 million a year with BALR and 433,

1319
00:43:57,418 --> 00:44:00,472
but you could make
$900,000 on just tennis,

1320
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:02,688
that becomes interesting
and I'm curious about

1321
00:44:02,688 --> 00:44:06,122
from a million to what, like how low?

1322
00:44:06,122 --> 00:44:07,773
Because what I don't think people realize.

1323
00:44:07,773 --> 00:44:09,595
- Very low, I guess, very low.

1324
00:44:09,595 --> 00:44:11,080
- Well, so think about
how powerful that is.

1325
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:11,913
- Yeah, I know.

1326
00:44:11,913 --> 00:44:12,861
- And that's when it kinda just started

1327
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:14,316
really clicking for me, so,

1328
00:44:14,316 --> 00:44:15,824
I think the long tail's super long

1329
00:44:15,824 --> 00:44:17,691
and I think there's special
people at this table

1330
00:44:17,691 --> 00:44:20,143
who are gonna be in the
higher percentage of this.

1331
00:44:20,143 --> 00:44:22,425
What I think is that everybody actually

1332
00:44:22,425 --> 00:44:24,687
is either passionate

1333
00:44:24,687 --> 00:44:26,490
or knowledgeable about something

1334
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:29,644
and both can, when you are passionate,

1335
00:44:29,644 --> 00:44:31,586
just that energy alone is interesting.

1336
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,727
Like, somebody being
unbelievably passionate

1337
00:44:33,727 --> 00:44:36,793
about Montclair and
becoming the local paper

1338
00:44:36,793 --> 00:44:40,498
on Instagram, on Facebook and on YouTube

1339
00:44:40,498 --> 00:44:43,523
has a $50 to $100,000 dollar business,

1340
00:44:43,523 --> 00:44:46,432
because the local businesses,
once everybody starts watching

1341
00:44:46,432 --> 00:44:48,443
are gonna wanna get into there somehow.

1342
00:44:48,443 --> 00:44:50,938
I don't think people have fully

1343
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,398
listen, this is the book
that changed my life

1344
00:44:53,398 --> 00:44:55,210
and like, really put me on.

1345
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:56,429
I never thought I would make

1346
00:44:56,429 --> 00:44:58,163
the updated version of Crush It!

1347
00:44:58,163 --> 00:45:00,856
What happened to me was the last 15 months

1348
00:45:00,856 --> 00:45:02,572
are different for me
than they were before.

1349
00:45:02,572 --> 00:45:06,369
I went all in, even though
I thought I was all in.

1350
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:08,849
And I was like, fuck, me being
at the forefront of this,

1351
00:45:08,849 --> 00:45:10,845
and if I have found way more upside

1352
00:45:10,845 --> 00:45:13,724
and way more white space, and
there's so much more to go,

1353
00:45:13,724 --> 00:45:17,877
oh, shit, nobody understands
how big this really is.

1354
00:45:17,877 --> 00:45:21,508
This, because of podcasting,
now you can be just audio

1355
00:45:21,508 --> 00:45:22,769
if you're embarrassed the way you look,

1356
00:45:22,769 --> 00:45:23,841
or you're self-conscious.

1357
00:45:23,841 --> 00:45:26,302
Writing, you vlog, it can make writing,

1358
00:45:26,302 --> 00:45:27,810
there's so, Facebook Live.

1359
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,082
We just did a live show.

1360
00:45:29,082 --> 00:45:29,915
- We did.

1361
00:45:29,915 --> 00:45:31,550
- Twenty years ago, for
us, as professionals,

1362
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:32,538
we would have been like, what?

1363
00:45:32,538 --> 00:45:34,572
Like, like, you have to QVC.

1364
00:45:34,572 --> 00:45:36,125
- And it wasn't difficult.

1365
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:38,687
When I used to like, sell
books on the Today Show,

1366
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,477
it was like a hairdresser and a stylist.

1367
00:45:40,477 --> 00:45:42,504
It was all, the comments, the whole thing.

1368
00:45:42,504 --> 00:45:44,201
Oprah, forget it, it was over the top.

1369
00:45:44,201 --> 00:45:45,556
It's so different now.

1370
00:45:45,556 --> 00:45:47,835
- And the attention's at scale.

1371
00:45:47,835 --> 00:45:49,700
Like, there's, you know, and so,

1372
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,082
I think what's gonna happen is,

1373
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:53,745
a lot more people are
gonna do this for a living.

1374
00:45:53,745 --> 00:45:55,471
I think a lot of people
are about to take control

1375
00:45:55,471 --> 00:45:58,652
of their own lives, and
use the decentralization

1376
00:45:58,652 --> 00:46:00,185
of our society and media,

1377
00:46:00,185 --> 00:46:02,983
not just, people are worried
about rigging elections,

1378
00:46:02,983 --> 00:46:05,520
and Trump and Brexit,

1379
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,650
and everybody focuses on these negatives,

1380
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:10,310
Russian Hackers, I'm like,
if it's that powerful,

1381
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:11,647
think what it can do for your life.

1382
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:12,972
- So the long tail will be way longer,

1383
00:46:12,972 --> 00:46:13,805
is what you're saying.

1384
00:46:13,805 --> 00:46:16,805
- Way, way, because
there's a practicality.

1385
00:46:16,805 --> 00:46:18,454
This is not about making
a million dollars.

1386
00:46:18,454 --> 00:46:20,076
This is, tell me how much money you make,

1387
00:46:20,076 --> 00:46:21,253
and tell me you how happy you are.

1388
00:46:21,253 --> 00:46:24,557
If you're unbelievably happy,
you love being a plumber,

1389
00:46:24,557 --> 00:46:27,161
and you make $87,000 a year
and you're happy as shit,

1390
00:46:27,161 --> 00:46:28,182
I don't want you,

1391
00:46:28,182 --> 00:46:29,789
I don't want you to watch anything I say.

1392
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:31,128
I don't want you to read my book.

1393
00:46:31,128 --> 00:46:32,717
Get the fuck out, you fuckin' won,

1394
00:46:32,717 --> 00:46:33,969
I'm so fuckin' proud of you.

1395
00:46:33,969 --> 00:46:35,325
Actually, go make other people happy

1396
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:36,497
'cause you're fuckin' happy.

1397
00:46:36,497 --> 00:46:37,626
But here's what I know.

1398
00:46:37,626 --> 00:46:41,283
Almost everybody is not
happy about one or the other.

1399
00:46:41,283 --> 00:46:43,342
And I'm like, wow, the practicality

1400
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,973
of being in the place of
both is extraordinary.

1401
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:48,399
Because it used to take
somebody as special as Bobbi,

1402
00:46:48,399 --> 00:46:50,792
'cause you had to be
really be all-time great.

1403
00:46:50,792 --> 00:46:53,459
Now, you can be just good enough

1404
00:46:54,754 --> 00:46:57,522
to offset, because the
opportunity of attention

1405
00:46:57,522 --> 00:47:02,522
on Instagram, Facebook,
YouTube, blogging, is so high

1406
00:47:02,602 --> 00:47:04,436
and the cost is zero.

1407
00:47:04,436 --> 00:47:05,469
- But I have a question.

1408
00:47:05,469 --> 00:47:06,302
- Please Bobbi.

1409
00:47:06,302 --> 00:47:09,219
- So I have 240,000 followers, 244.

1410
00:47:10,165 --> 00:47:14,526
Okay, I mean, I listen to
16 million to whatever.

1411
00:47:14,526 --> 00:47:16,399
I'm building a new brand.

1412
00:47:16,399 --> 00:47:18,613
Do I need to be mostly concerned

1413
00:47:18,613 --> 00:47:20,330
with raising how many people follow me,

1414
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:21,569
and mine are all organic followers.

1415
00:47:21,569 --> 00:47:24,322
- So you need to understand attention.

1416
00:47:24,322 --> 00:47:27,621
So, for example, what's
great about you that you have

1417
00:47:27,621 --> 00:47:29,587
that's maybe different
than other people is,

1418
00:47:29,587 --> 00:47:31,545
you're rich, right.

1419
00:47:31,545 --> 00:47:33,072
You've made some money.

1420
00:47:33,072 --> 00:47:34,649
- So that has nothing
to do with my question.

1421
00:47:34,649 --> 00:47:35,567
- Sure it does.

1422
00:47:35,567 --> 00:47:36,473
You just heard somebody say

1423
00:47:36,473 --> 00:47:38,091
that we're getting fuckin'
people to watch something

1424
00:47:38,091 --> 00:47:40,644
for half a fuckin' penny.

1425
00:47:40,644 --> 00:47:42,918
You need to run fuckin' ads.

1426
00:47:42,918 --> 00:47:47,548
When ads are under priced,
they're better than organic.

1427
00:47:47,548 --> 00:47:49,623
That's the confusion in the system.

1428
00:47:49,623 --> 00:47:51,072
But that was, by the way, real quick,

1429
00:47:51,072 --> 00:47:52,955
that was the most
important part of content

1430
00:47:52,955 --> 00:47:54,392
that I've put out in a very long time.

1431
00:47:54,392 --> 00:47:55,225
That little moment.

1432
00:47:55,225 --> 00:47:56,377
This is why I do this shit, like

1433
00:47:56,377 --> 00:47:58,345
I dunno, I've known that
for the last fuckin'

1434
00:47:58,345 --> 00:48:00,196
five years, I just have
never said it before

1435
00:48:00,196 --> 00:48:01,029
until this moment.

1436
00:48:01,029 --> 00:48:04,196
- So it doesn't matter if
I try to grow my followers,

1437
00:48:04,196 --> 00:48:05,029
or should I be focused

1438
00:48:05,029 --> 00:48:06,608
on trying to get to a million followers?

1439
00:48:06,608 --> 00:48:08,719
- You should focus on
getting the most under-priced

1440
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,853
attention you possibly can
in return for what you want.

1441
00:48:11,853 --> 00:48:13,239
Organic's a great way to do it,

1442
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:15,890
since it's fuckin' organic
and it's sweat equity.

1443
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:17,591
And for anybody who's starting at zero,

1444
00:48:17,591 --> 00:48:19,189
it's all you fuckin' got.

1445
00:48:19,189 --> 00:48:21,430
When you're fuckin' Bobbi B
and you gotta couple dollars,

1446
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:23,117
and you can spend $10,000 dollars a month

1447
00:48:23,117 --> 00:48:24,613
if you choose to on Instagram

1448
00:48:24,613 --> 00:48:28,205
and get a hundred to
500,000 in media value

1449
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,628
in Gary Vaynerchuk's point-of-view,

1450
00:48:29,628 --> 00:48:31,749
you better fuckin' do
it because it goes away.

1451
00:48:31,749 --> 00:48:34,387
- But then why not hop on
my friend Elvis Durand's

1452
00:48:34,387 --> 00:48:36,551
you know, radio show that
he's got four million people?

1453
00:48:36,551 --> 00:48:37,384
Why not go?

1454
00:48:37,384 --> 00:48:38,217
- Because he doesn't
actually have four million,

1455
00:48:38,217 --> 00:48:39,092
and Elvis is insane.

1456
00:48:39,092 --> 00:48:39,925
- He doesn't?

1457
00:48:39,925 --> 00:48:41,218
- No, because the rate,
you know (laughter)

1458
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:44,949
and number two, he probably has 2.3 or 1.7

1459
00:48:44,949 --> 00:48:46,225
or whatever the actual number is,

1460
00:48:46,225 --> 00:48:47,364
'cause, and it's not Elvis' fault.

1461
00:48:47,364 --> 00:48:49,507
Elvis is the fuckin', I fuckin' love him.

1462
00:48:49,507 --> 00:48:52,322
It's just the way that radio
metrics and TV metrics work.

1463
00:48:52,322 --> 00:48:53,572
They're broken.

1464
00:48:54,743 --> 00:48:56,160
You should, like,

1465
00:48:57,262 --> 00:48:59,228
you're doing everything exactly right.

1466
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:01,952
Under-priced attention is
getting your ass into Z100

1467
00:49:01,952 --> 00:49:05,040
and sitting down for 15
minutes and siphoning attention

1468
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,717
and coming here, and being part of this.

1469
00:49:06,717 --> 00:49:08,329
All the things that you have
because of your rolodex.

1470
00:49:08,329 --> 00:49:09,637
- All the things that my husband says,

1471
00:49:09,637 --> 00:49:10,470
why are you doing this?

1472
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:11,763
- Right, 'cause he's not as smart as you.

1473
00:49:11,763 --> 00:49:13,161
- Oh no, he's really smart.

1474
00:49:13,161 --> 00:49:13,994
- But not as smart as you.

1475
00:49:13,994 --> 00:49:14,827
- And he's much more handsome.

1476
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:16,281
- Anybody, anybody,

1477
00:49:16,281 --> 00:49:18,131
who doesn't understand trading attention,

1478
00:49:18,131 --> 00:49:21,028
is the only game or
doesn't value it as much,

1479
00:49:21,028 --> 00:49:22,969
is already not as smart as.

1480
00:49:22,969 --> 00:49:24,667
Because if you wanna
understand why Mohammed Ali

1481
00:49:24,667 --> 00:49:26,496
is who he is or The Beatles,

1482
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:28,988
or Howard Stern or anything else, like

1483
00:49:28,988 --> 00:49:31,499
or how Ronald Reagan
actually built his legacy,

1484
00:49:31,499 --> 00:49:34,282
it is about under-priced attention.

1485
00:49:34,282 --> 00:49:36,028
And that's what we're
living through right now.

1486
00:49:36,028 --> 00:49:38,657
And so, while these guys
build a fuckin' street

1487
00:49:38,657 --> 00:49:40,587
kind of cultural brand called BALR,

1488
00:49:40,587 --> 00:49:42,548
you've got, they're comp,
you've got Under Armour

1489
00:49:42,548 --> 00:49:43,768
sitting around and putzing around

1490
00:49:43,768 --> 00:49:46,856
and spending four million
dollars to make a 30 second spot

1491
00:49:46,856 --> 00:49:49,656
and like, people are lost,

1492
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:53,689
because it's real change,
under-priced attention.

1493
00:49:53,689 --> 00:49:55,375
You should take that video of you and me

1494
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:57,883
and you should run it against Gary V fans

1495
00:49:57,883 --> 00:49:59,853
on Facebook for a penny a pop

1496
00:49:59,853 --> 00:50:02,636
and start siphoning my audience into you.

1497
00:50:02,636 --> 00:50:04,050
- I did that with our meeting.

1498
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,181
- So let's talk about it.

1499
00:50:05,181 --> 00:50:06,014
Let's teach people.

1500
00:50:06,014 --> 00:50:06,847
What did you do?

1501
00:50:06,847 --> 00:50:09,151
- So I took from the
picture I posted of us.

1502
00:50:09,151 --> 00:50:12,295
I did a promotion on Instagram,
targeted your audience

1503
00:50:12,295 --> 00:50:14,748
and then, still, I still
wanna keep it female,

1504
00:50:14,748 --> 00:50:16,691
so you know, female audience, right.

1505
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:17,581
- And what happened?

1506
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:19,943
- It, you know, I got a
lot of engagement on it.

1507
00:50:19,943 --> 00:50:22,506
And yeah, when he saw his
(mumbles), he was like (snap)

1508
00:50:22,506 --> 00:50:23,493
- And it's contextual.

1509
00:50:23,493 --> 00:50:24,745
- What's a lot of engagement?

1510
00:50:24,745 --> 00:50:27,232
- Well, it, you know, I
try to have minimum one to

1511
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:31,204
two percent, two plus percent
engagement for your followers

1512
00:50:31,204 --> 00:50:32,297
is actually a lot.

1513
00:50:32,297 --> 00:50:34,555
The people who have above two to three,

1514
00:50:34,555 --> 00:50:36,671
into the five percent
engagement are unicorns.

1515
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,834
They're normally the YouTube people

1516
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:39,610
that put all of their life out there,

1517
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:41,568
so people feel super connected to them.

1518
00:50:41,568 --> 00:50:42,401
I would say if you're at.

1519
00:50:42,401 --> 00:50:43,600
- Or, or,

1520
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,069
and lemme give you a bigger insight.

1521
00:50:45,069 --> 00:50:47,273
Their audience is so young,

1522
00:50:47,273 --> 00:50:49,100
it's their only consumption.

1523
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,262
The reason YouTube people over index

1524
00:50:51,262 --> 00:50:53,488
is when your audience is 13 to 15,

1525
00:50:53,488 --> 00:50:56,173
is 11 to 15 year old girls,

1526
00:50:56,173 --> 00:50:58,857
they literally leave
school, get on their phone,

1527
00:50:58,857 --> 00:51:00,142
and fall asleep.

1528
00:51:00,142 --> 00:51:02,706
Like, like, so you're,
that is the only media,

1529
00:51:02,706 --> 00:51:06,203
there is nothing else, there
is no some TV, some print,

1530
00:51:06,203 --> 00:51:08,466
some looking outside to the real world.

1531
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:09,948
It is that.

1532
00:51:09,948 --> 00:51:11,296
And so their engagement is higher.

1533
00:51:11,296 --> 00:51:12,459
But let's talk about something else.

1534
00:51:12,459 --> 00:51:13,979
This is not just a metrics game.

1535
00:51:13,979 --> 00:51:15,962
It's contextual,

1536
00:51:15,962 --> 00:51:18,526
so the other thing that Anna
was able to do with that photo

1537
00:51:18,526 --> 00:51:21,348
is it's not only that she
was able to target my fans,

1538
00:51:21,348 --> 00:51:22,542
my fans know me,

1539
00:51:22,542 --> 00:51:25,012
they know I'm not meeting
with every single person.

1540
00:51:25,012 --> 00:51:28,112
And so, they're like, okay,
why would Gary waste his time

1541
00:51:28,112 --> 00:51:31,740
or what is it, and so like,
it's the contextual nature

1542
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,776
of the awareness.

1543
00:51:32,776 --> 00:51:36,686
The Rock photo, for me, is
not only good on the metrics,

1544
00:51:36,686 --> 00:51:41,103
it's good on the contextual
nature of the impression.

1545
00:51:41,987 --> 00:51:44,783
- So I have a question,
for Bobbi actually.

1546
00:51:44,783 --> 00:51:45,924
I don't know if this is out there already,

1547
00:51:45,924 --> 00:51:48,602
but why did you leave and
create your own brand now?

1548
00:51:48,602 --> 00:51:51,784
- Well, I started a make-up
brand with 10 lipsticks

1549
00:51:51,784 --> 00:51:54,062
when I was 30 years old,
and after four years,

1550
00:51:54,062 --> 00:51:57,744
I sold it to Estée Lauder
and grew the business to

1551
00:51:57,744 --> 00:52:00,161
a billion dollars and after a

1552
00:52:01,492 --> 00:52:03,906
past couple, the last couple years working

1553
00:52:03,906 --> 00:52:05,015
with the big corporation

1554
00:52:05,015 --> 00:52:06,668
and knowing that things were changing,

1555
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:08,670
I didn't have as much power to do it,

1556
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:13,222
so I don't regret selling
it, I don't regret staying,

1557
00:52:13,222 --> 00:52:14,951
I don't regret anything
because that's how you learn

1558
00:52:14,951 --> 00:52:18,480
and get better, but starting
something new, my way,

1559
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,938
is kind of the coolest thing in the world.

1560
00:52:19,938 --> 00:52:22,127
- Yeah, awesome, when I heard
you were gonna be part of it,

1561
00:52:22,127 --> 00:52:24,549
I was like, wow, yeah.

1562
00:52:24,549 --> 00:52:25,382
(crosstalk) I didn't.

1563
00:52:25,382 --> 00:52:26,215
- People don't know.

1564
00:52:26,215 --> 00:52:28,857
I get on your show, I tell,
I get on everyone's show,

1565
00:52:28,857 --> 00:52:31,119
I left the brand, I have
nothing to do with it.

1566
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:32,527
The past year and a half.

1567
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:35,028
- I have great news and
great, great, great news.

1568
00:52:35,028 --> 00:52:37,141
Nobody will ever think you left the brand.

1569
00:52:37,141 --> 00:52:38,802
The brand's your fuckin' name, Bobbi.

1570
00:52:38,802 --> 00:52:41,011
- I know, but it's not
what, the brand is different

1571
00:52:41,011 --> 00:52:41,844
than what I created.

1572
00:52:41,844 --> 00:52:44,696
- I get it, but Bobbi,
Bobbi, you're a big girl.

1573
00:52:44,696 --> 00:52:45,896
They're never gonna think you left.

1574
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:46,729
- I don't care, I want them to.

1575
00:52:46,729 --> 00:52:48,353
- It's your fucking name.

1576
00:52:48,353 --> 00:52:50,279
- I started it and I had a great brand.

1577
00:52:50,279 --> 00:52:51,147
But it's not the same as it was anymore.

1578
00:52:51,147 --> 00:52:53,429
- Mazeltov, nobody's
gonna know. (laughter)

1579
00:52:53,429 --> 00:52:57,741
- I'm gonna still tell people (laughter).

1580
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:01,076
- Alright, I'm gonna
ask you guys a question.

1581
00:53:01,076 --> 00:53:01,909
Can you promise me

1582
00:53:01,909 --> 00:53:05,793
that you'll make a huge
commitment to audio?

1583
00:53:05,793 --> 00:53:06,626
- Yes.

1584
00:53:06,626 --> 00:53:07,459
- Thank you Bobbi.

1585
00:53:07,459 --> 00:53:08,292
- Yes.

1586
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:09,125
- Yes.

1587
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:09,958
- So, podcast audio?

1588
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:13,417
- Guys, nobody owns the
football soccer podcast space,

1589
00:53:13,417 --> 00:53:14,465
fuckin' do it.

1590
00:53:14,465 --> 00:53:16,155
Take the fuckin' money you're
making, you're making money,

1591
00:53:16,155 --> 00:53:17,963
you're selling some fuckin' hoodies,

1592
00:53:17,963 --> 00:53:18,963
you're making real profit.

1593
00:53:18,963 --> 00:53:20,316
Can you please fuckin' invest

1594
00:53:20,316 --> 00:53:22,442
in two kids that know
a lot or two old peeps

1595
00:53:22,442 --> 00:53:23,400
or I don't give a fuck,

1596
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,419
two people that know
about fuckin' football

1597
00:53:25,419 --> 00:53:27,489
and get them on fucking and use

1598
00:53:27,489 --> 00:53:30,125
you used 433's attention to build this.

1599
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:32,311
You can have a top 100
podcast in the world.

1600
00:53:32,311 --> 00:53:34,110
It will change your business.

1601
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,516
- Okay, how do we start a podcast?

1602
00:53:35,516 --> 00:53:37,045
- Well you can use Anchor,

1603
00:53:37,045 --> 00:53:38,233
which makes it real fuckin' easy,

1604
00:53:38,233 --> 00:53:39,342
'cause then you're just walking.

1605
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:40,404
It's a nice little app.

1606
00:53:40,404 --> 00:53:42,177
Or, you can email Seth.

1607
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:46,120
Seth, actually, Seth, I want
you to write, for my blog,

1608
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,899
we'll link you up, we'll
give you some looks,

1609
00:53:47,899 --> 00:53:51,366
you're also handsome, so
that'll be good for you.

1610
00:53:51,366 --> 00:53:53,087
I want you to write a post, a guest post

1611
00:53:53,087 --> 00:53:55,186
on my personal Gary
Vaynerchuk.blog of like

1612
00:53:55,186 --> 00:53:57,142
how you start a podcast,
all the different ways.

1613
00:53:57,142 --> 00:53:57,975
- [Seth] Great.

1614
00:53:57,975 --> 00:53:59,825
- Anchor will be one way, that's
like the simple light way.

1615
00:53:59,825 --> 00:54:01,393
How do we do it, how do we do it?

1616
00:54:01,393 --> 00:54:02,493
Then tell some personal stories

1617
00:54:02,493 --> 00:54:04,301
of what we were doing before we got here,

1618
00:54:04,301 --> 00:54:05,968
like, it's not hard.

1619
00:54:06,859 --> 00:54:07,961
- I got the interviews down.

1620
00:54:07,961 --> 00:54:09,653
I know who to call, I have
the address book, I just.

1621
00:54:09,653 --> 00:54:11,162
- You're crazy, you're ridiculous

1622
00:54:11,162 --> 00:54:11,995
because your rolodex.

1623
00:54:11,995 --> 00:54:13,501
- No, I mean, like, when
I say, how to do it,

1624
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:14,334
I mean, how do I do it?

1625
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,433
- I know what you mean, no, no
if you think I'm asking Seth

1626
00:54:16,433 --> 00:54:19,058
for the magic part, I'm
asking him for the fuckin'

1627
00:54:19,058 --> 00:54:21,518
the nails and the hammer
like download this app,

1628
00:54:21,518 --> 00:54:23,239
get this fuckin' microphone,

1629
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:25,888
like upload this way, this
is the most efficient way

1630
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:27,849
to be on iTunes and
Stitcher and Google Play.

1631
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:29,533
He will do the really, kind of like.

1632
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:30,908
- I interview every Uber drive I have.

1633
00:54:30,908 --> 00:54:32,012
Everyone's got a story.

1634
00:54:32,012 --> 00:54:32,990
- Bobbi, the other thing you have

1635
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:35,208
and this is how I would
tell you to launch your,

1636
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:36,921
your podcast specifically.

1637
00:54:36,921 --> 00:54:38,596
You gotta go for the biggest whale down.

1638
00:54:38,596 --> 00:54:39,997
Your first 10 guests,

1639
00:54:39,997 --> 00:54:41,166
you gotta go in for the.

1640
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:42,324
- I got Gloria Steinem already,

1641
00:54:42,324 --> 00:54:45,226
I got some, I've done all of that.

1642
00:54:45,226 --> 00:54:46,059
- Do it again.

1643
00:54:46,059 --> 00:54:47,528
- I have it all, it's all
on Facebook Live, but yeah.

1644
00:54:47,528 --> 00:54:48,361
- Do it again.

1645
00:54:48,361 --> 00:54:49,194
- Okay.

1646
00:54:49,194 --> 00:54:51,390
Or, you know, depends on
the quality of the audio,

1647
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:52,316
like, we'll do all the,

1648
00:54:52,316 --> 00:54:56,866
like my podcast is ripping
the audio from my vlog.

1649
00:54:56,866 --> 00:54:58,380
This is actually the only original thing

1650
00:54:58,380 --> 00:54:59,213
I'm doing right now.

1651
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:00,147
- I hope Terry and Michelle
are listening to this,

1652
00:55:00,147 --> 00:55:02,327
'cause I don't wanna repeat it. (laughter)

1653
00:55:02,327 --> 00:55:04,225
- Alright, final thoughts.

1654
00:55:04,225 --> 00:55:06,231
For the Vayner Nation, what
do you want them to know?

1655
00:55:06,231 --> 00:55:07,230
This is where you can right hook,

1656
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:08,440
this is where you can jab,

1657
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,686
this is where you can
do whatever you want,

1658
00:55:09,686 --> 00:55:10,519
freestyle session.

1659
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:12,017
- I wanna get your mother on my podcast.

1660
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,929
- I'll talk to Tamara
Vaynerchuk for you, done.

1661
00:55:13,929 --> 00:55:15,520
Anna?

1662
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,216
- Yeah, I would just say that,

1663
00:55:17,216 --> 00:55:20,242
if you are looking for someone
who's just gonna keep it real

1664
00:55:20,242 --> 00:55:21,602
you know, give it to
you straight, kinda, I,

1665
00:55:21,602 --> 00:55:22,435
you know what?

1666
00:55:22,435 --> 00:55:24,937
I'm the female Gary V for fitness,

1667
00:55:24,937 --> 00:55:26,689
so if you want to, you know, get into the.

1668
00:55:26,689 --> 00:55:28,248
- I didn't realize I
looked so good. (laughter)

1669
00:55:28,248 --> 00:55:30,129
I'm super pumped.

1670
00:55:30,129 --> 00:55:32,487
- You know, fitness stuff,
real, I'm your girl.

1671
00:55:32,487 --> 00:55:33,388
- Love it.

1672
00:55:33,388 --> 00:55:34,727
Men?

1673
00:55:34,727 --> 00:55:36,118
- Yeah, you know why we're here,

1674
00:55:36,118 --> 00:55:38,779
I sent you a DM a couple of weeks ago

1675
00:55:38,779 --> 00:55:42,306
and we will set up a (mumbles) report

1676
00:55:42,306 --> 00:55:45,780
and I think today we will
ask you to be part of the.

1677
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,005
- I mean, this guy's a real gangster,

1678
00:55:47,005 --> 00:55:49,779
he's trying to leverage this moment to

1679
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:51,868
force me into advisory, I love it.

1680
00:55:51,868 --> 00:55:52,961
That's fuckin' gangster.

1681
00:55:52,961 --> 00:55:56,672
Question of the day, that I
wanna end the Pod Sessions with.

1682
00:55:56,672 --> 00:55:58,202
I'm gonna start, I'll
give you a few minutes,

1683
00:55:58,202 --> 00:55:59,921
you get, I want a lot of answers to this,

1684
00:55:59,921 --> 00:56:03,094
all over Twitter, use the
hashtag GV Pod Sessions

1685
00:56:03,094 --> 00:56:04,449
to answer, 'cause I
wanna get the feedback.

1686
00:56:04,449 --> 00:56:05,282
All four of us

1687
00:56:05,282 --> 00:56:07,591
are gonna ask a question
of the audience to answer.

1688
00:56:07,591 --> 00:56:09,917
This is an opportunity for
us to get consumer insight

1689
00:56:09,917 --> 00:56:12,409
or if you have, if you have a passion,

1690
00:56:12,409 --> 00:56:14,453
it will be an opportunity to get everybody

1691
00:56:14,453 --> 00:56:16,181
to start thinking a different way.

1692
00:56:16,181 --> 00:56:17,108
I'll start first.

1693
00:56:17,108 --> 00:56:19,858
What is your 2018 voice strategy?

1694
00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:22,193
Bobbi B?

1695
00:56:22,193 --> 00:56:23,549
- What is my 2018 voice?

1696
00:56:23,549 --> 00:56:26,255
- No, we're asking the
audience, all four of us

1697
00:56:26,255 --> 00:56:27,746
are gonna ask a question of the audience.

1698
00:56:27,746 --> 00:56:29,110
They're gonna answer.

1699
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:31,152
They're gonna use the
hashtag GV Pod Sessions.

1700
00:56:31,152 --> 00:56:32,839
You can go and look at all these answers.

1701
00:56:32,839 --> 00:56:34,919
This might be a way, what I
use the question of the day for

1702
00:56:34,919 --> 00:56:36,686
is sometimes market research, right,

1703
00:56:36,686 --> 00:56:38,101
'cause you get a thousand answers.

1704
00:56:38,101 --> 00:56:39,945
Sometimes I use it, as I'm using it now

1705
00:56:39,945 --> 00:56:41,895
to get people to finally
fuckin' do something

1706
00:56:41,895 --> 00:56:44,696
that will make them happy and
will bring them fruitfulness.

1707
00:56:44,696 --> 00:56:46,248
So my question to the audience

1708
00:56:46,248 --> 00:56:48,357
in wrapping up Pod Sessions number two is,

1709
00:56:48,357 --> 00:56:52,867
what is your, the audience,
2018 Voice Strategy?

1710
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:54,753
Bobbi, what is your
question for the audience?

1711
00:56:54,753 --> 00:56:56,276
- My question would be,

1712
00:56:56,276 --> 00:56:58,242
what is the one or two things that

1713
00:56:58,242 --> 00:56:59,772
would make your life different?

1714
00:56:59,772 --> 00:57:02,209
What could simplify what
you're doing right now?

1715
00:57:02,209 --> 00:57:04,677
- Simplify, love it.

1716
00:57:04,677 --> 00:57:07,583
- I wanna know what are the
one or two things that are

1717
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,588
causing people's struggle to overtake them

1718
00:57:09,588 --> 00:57:11,070
and not allow them to move past them?

1719
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:13,263
- What's the one or two
struggles that have more leverage

1720
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,959
right now, why are you on
defense instead of offense?

1721
00:57:16,959 --> 00:57:17,792
BALR?

1722
00:57:19,497 --> 00:57:21,402
- Yeah, a question for BALR exactly.

1723
00:57:21,402 --> 00:57:26,340
Like, what is your favorite
online platform to buy apparel?

1724
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,797
- Love that, that's a great question.

1725
00:57:27,797 --> 00:57:28,654
- And why?

1726
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:30,473
- Love that, great.

1727
00:57:30,473 --> 00:57:31,958
Gang, thank you.
