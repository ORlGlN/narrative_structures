1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
yeah Morgan my way I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> super pumped you</font>

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,279
just did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd much rather just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do QA</font>

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,259
if you want to go right into that I'll

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,389
jam with you the whole time it's

5
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:18,320
good for<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start switching</font>

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,430
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's they don't have the</font>

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,609
reporting to justify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ROI of spending</font>

8
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:25,769
it in other places so what happens

9
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:28,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">Morgan is in both organizations the</font>

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,570
cable companies the facebooks and the

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,820
other digital platforms and the CPGs

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,620
that completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> subsidize all of this</font>

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,540
and the car companies there's a

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,879
marketing head who has to justify all

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,070
their spend and there's historic rules

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,430
in place to what the ROI is in certain

17
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,289
arenas and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> something new comes look</font>

18
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,420
so for example every brand that is

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,129
trying to sell to somebody who is

20
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,250
between 20 and 30 years old should spend

21
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,780
a disproportionate amount of its money

22
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> energy in 2015 on Instagram because</font>

23
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's where 20 or 30 year olds are</font>

24
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:02,399
giving their attention but nobody's

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,329
gonna be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to justify a</font>

26
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,000
ten-million-dollar spend based on

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,180
getting 78 hearts on a picture

28
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,450
right and so what is happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

29
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,560
always happens is first comes the market

30
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,500
facebook then comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the justification</font>

31
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,960
right datalogix and all these other

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,280
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that play in my world that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,280
justifying the ROI of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook but</font>

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,080
there's a friction<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook was more</font>

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,299
valuable to market 36 months ago than it

36
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,280
is today and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can be less valuable in</font>

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,710
36 months because the number one thing I

38
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,060
know more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than anything more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than the</font>

39
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,640
Sun comes up tomorrow is that marketers

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,329
ruin everything right I mean snapchat

41
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,250
hasn't even gotten at sea legs under it

42
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,229
and marketers are in there ruining it

43
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,720
right and so that's the constant game of

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,909
cat and mouse so Morgan the reason it

45
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">takes time is because companies aren't</font>

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,110
entrepreneurial they're not making the

47
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,130
right decision for their business

48
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,750
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> making the right decision for</font>

49
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,750
themselves a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in this room</font>

50
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,549
will go on to careers where they will

51
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,200
make decisions based on what's best for

52
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,270
them not what's best for the business

53
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,818
because they're not incentivized to act

54
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:09,919
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

55
00:02:09,919 --> 00:00:00,000
human<font color="#CCCCCC"> behavior</font>
