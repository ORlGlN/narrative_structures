for what you do it was six<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago</font>

6
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,640
that I was commuting an hour in each

12
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:31,439
see parallels between tennis and

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,500
business and being successful in either

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,500

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,559
lot of private school kids rich kids who

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,260

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,450
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fact I really do see one</font>

28
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,470
parallel and I've never thought about

29
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,720
this before and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really why I</font>

30
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,590
love the askgaryvee show<font color="#CCCCCC"> King you know I</font>

31
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,369
I i do see a parallel I'm blown<font color="#CCCCCC"> away</font>

32
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,780
that I once lost a match that I was

33
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,770
winning 5-0 in a set and I'm also super

34
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,299

35
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,229

36
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,259
that you know and you've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> me talk</font>

37
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,060
about halftime adjustments right on the

38
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,829
coach they'll be down 21 nothing and

39
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:40,170
then it's 23 21 and I won<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

40
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,700
didn't game playing well but I adjusted

41
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,890
that to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me is tennis right to me tennis</font>

42
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,229
is fascinating cuz the set is very long

43
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you can be down 30 and then you're</font>

44
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,700
adjusting<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're seeing patterns for</font>

45
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,960

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,780

49
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,409
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> me like help me here you've had me</font>

50
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,680
down 52 twice you right and you lost

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,030
those matches

52
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so what I did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in those matches were</font>

53

54
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,720
matches when I was down 52 to Nate what

55
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,569
happened was you know one I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

56
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:22,319
refused to lose but<font color="#CCCCCC"> to I really kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,750
took a step back look that what happened

58
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,730
in those first seven games and<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

59
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,520
attacking either weaknesses of his or

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,470
strengths of mine it's a very mental

61
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,959
game I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> reacting to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what was already</font>

62
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,500
happening in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific set and I was</font>

63
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,440
able to adjust in a win 75 much to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

64
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,890
happiness and so much like in business

65
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,750
people set out to do things it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

66
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,070
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Mike Tyson quote right</font>

67
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,780
everybody's got a plan until they get

68
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,730
punched in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the face you know that's what</font>

69
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,110
I see in tennis and that's what I see in

70
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,510
business you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your business plan you</font>

71
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,190
think you're going to succeed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

72
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,600
you're out in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the market and somebody</font>

73
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,400
copies your product for less or is

74
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,440
better than you or nobody really wanted

75
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,560
your stupid app you've got a just and in

76
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,630
tennis cuz it's a set it takes a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

77
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,150
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that that kind of like set to</font>

78
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,980
like form and you've gotta just wait a

79
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,810
minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's playing off of his back here</font>

80
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,519
let me go app his backhand things of

81
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,110
that nature let me go to the net because

82
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,940
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> winning this baseline game the</font>

83
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,250
adjustments in real time and the emotion

84
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">and composure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the intestinal</font>

85
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">fortitude to be down 52 and come back</font>

86
00:03:24,480 --> 00:00:00,000
and win that's how I see
