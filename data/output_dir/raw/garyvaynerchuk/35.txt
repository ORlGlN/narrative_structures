♪ Me and Gary Vee up in the office ♪

2
00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:07,670
- [Man] What's cooking?

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,860
- It's my last week at VaynerMedia.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,150
- [Man] I'm aware.

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,453
- It's crazy, I know, I've
been here three years.

6
00:00:12,453 --> 00:00:13,740
- What are you doing?

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,690
- So, I'm going through
a very big life change

8
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,700
and I am leaving advertising,

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,530
leaving New York City,
leaving the country.

10
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,475
I'm just going to go
travel for like a year.

11
00:00:22,475 --> 00:00:23,825
- Good for you.

12
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:26,300
- I wanted to do it for a
really really long time and--

13
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,900
- The sooner the better
with shit like that.

14
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,380
- I know, and I want to go into like

15
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,150
the health and wellness, medicine world.

16
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,650
- You look good.

17
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,930
- Thanks.

18
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,410
Yeah, I've been uh,

19
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,130
I definitely feel better than I used to.

20
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:40,963
That's for sure.

21
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,930
So, yeah, it's a big career
change you can't make overnight.

22
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:46,870
So, I was like, well, I might as well

23
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,772
take advantage of the
time and really like,

24
00:00:49,772 --> 00:00:51,700
get some clarity and think about things

25
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,680
a little bit, because you can't make

26
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,605
big decisions like that when
you're so in the thick of it.

27
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:55,438
- In it.

28
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:56,470
- You're like, "I have no perspective,

29
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,170
I can't see anything".

30
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,030
- So right.

31
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,550
- So yeah, I mean, I feel like there was

32
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,342
so many factors that kind
of played a role and--

33
00:01:04,342 --> 00:01:05,489
- Of course.

34
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,960
- But I don't know, the
past couple of months like,

35
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,700
all the cards kind of lined up perfectly

36
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,864
and I was just like, "This is right."

37
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:11,890
- Good for you.

38
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,550
- So, yeah.

39
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,880
- Thank you for everything.

40
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,170
- Thank you, I mean it's
been an awesome three years.

41
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,620
Like, I mean I told Shirley this

42
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,737
and I'll tell Claud this later,

43
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:24,240
at the end of the day I really do.

44
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,220
I leave with a lot of good vibes

45
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,840
and I felt very, just
like loved and supported,

46
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,010
and you don't find that
at a lot of agencies,

47
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,080
or a lot of places in general.

48
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,160
Yeah, it's been a great experience,

49
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,180
I'm super grateful for
it, it's weird to leave.

50
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,097
- Is there anything I can help
with in this next chapter?

51
00:01:44,097 --> 00:01:46,510
- Probably, at some point for sure.

52
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,810
- Yeah, don't be shy.

53
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,510
- No, I won't, trust me, I won't.

54
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,343
- I believe you.

55
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:51,430
- I'll definitely like--

56
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,079
- I know what makes you good.

57
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,590
- If I can think about anything,

58
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,655
I think I need to kind of figure out--

59
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:57,488
- What?

60
00:01:57,488 --> 00:01:59,040
- That world I want to go into is so huge

61
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,140
and it's getting really cluttered,

62
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,653
and it's getting really,
just like inauthentic.

63
00:02:02,653 --> 00:02:05,280
- Can I give you a quick piece of advice?

64
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,113
- Please.

65
00:02:06,113 --> 00:02:07,180
- Every world is like that.

66
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,013
- Yeah.

67
00:02:08,013 --> 00:02:08,846
- Don't let that cripple you.

68
00:02:08,846 --> 00:02:09,679
- Yeah.

69
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,474
- And go narrow to what makes you pop.

70
00:02:11,474 --> 00:02:12,307
- Right.

71
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:15,904
- Motivational speakers are
my most hated people, yet--

72
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:16,737
- You mean by other people?

73
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:17,576
- I hate them.

74
00:02:17,576 --> 00:02:18,409
- Oh.

75
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:20,310
- Yet I get categorized in
that world all the time.

76
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,143
- Right.

77
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:22,370
- But I'm not crippled because I know

78
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,049
that I'm not trying to do the wrong thing.

79
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:26,880
- Right, or you're not
trying to do whatever.

80
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,783
- The wrong thing.

81
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:28,616
- Yeah.

82
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:29,570
- This is, forget about that.

83
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,403
- Yeah.

84
00:02:30,403 --> 00:02:32,577
- If you don't ever look
for the white space.

85
00:02:32,577 --> 00:02:34,030
It doesn't exist.

86
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,110
- Hm, yeah, just like make it be your own.

87
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,856
- Do what the fuck you know.

88
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:39,006
- What you're good at.

89
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:39,839
- Like if you know yoga.

90
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:40,672
- Right.

91
00:02:40,672 --> 00:02:42,060
- Yoga's plenty fucking
(mumbles), you know.

92
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,893
- Yeah.

93
00:02:42,893 --> 00:02:45,194
- Be in the cream rises
to the top business.

94
00:02:45,194 --> 00:02:46,477
- Yeah.

95
00:02:46,477 --> 00:02:47,320
- Not in the I'm going to see

96
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,840
something no one else sees business.

97
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,080
- Right, and that's not the way.

98
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,210
I don't want to look at this as like

99
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,113
a business opportunity, of like,

100
00:02:52,113 --> 00:02:53,670
let me go travel the world and

101
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,150
find these trendy things and bring them.

102
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,780
Like that's not what I, I truly want

103
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,150
to find a way to like, help people who are

104
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,860
chronically ill, and cannot feed...

105
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,212
They don't have the resources,
or something like that.

106
00:03:02,212 --> 00:03:03,693
I'm not sure exactly what it is but--

107
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:05,050
- So, all the people that are doing

108
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,000
the wrong thing, crowded, not authentic,

109
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,540
it just has nothing to do with you.

110
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,400
- Yeah, yeah.

111
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,676
- I'm not crippled by other agencies

112
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:15,210
sucking up, giving a fuck about people.

113
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,981
- Yeah and if you were, you wouldn't

114
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:19,750
be where you are, because you can't--

115
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,920
- That's the thing you need to do.

116
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,710
- Yeah, that's a good piece of advice.

117
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,589
- It's a really good
piece of advice, like--

118
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:27,115
- Yeah.

119
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:29,080
- What do you want to do?

120
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,600
And do it.

121
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,020
And literally eliminate every other--

122
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,853
- That's actually really simple

123
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:33,686
when you think about it, like--

124
00:03:33,686 --> 00:03:35,060
- It's super fucking simple.

125
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,060
- We get so in our heads--

126
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,380
- 'Cause we get taught, we get taught.

127
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,213
- Yeah.

128
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:41,711
- We get taught, and I think in hindsight,

129
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:43,843
my inability to learn that way--

130
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:44,770
- Mhm.

131
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,040
- Became my greatest strength.

132
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,380
- Yeah, and I feel like, but once you

133
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,250
learn that way, it's very
hard to unlearn that.

134
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,446
- It's very hard, the same way
I can't do the other thing,

135
00:03:52,446 --> 00:03:55,168
I can't learn anything the normal way.

136
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,001
- Yeah.

137
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:56,834
- You know?

138
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:58,460
- Yeah, well a lot of people are like

139
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,535
"You know, what you're
doing it's kind of risky,"

140
00:04:00,535 --> 00:04:02,480
and I'm like, I don't know--

141
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,313
- Risky for what?

142
00:04:03,313 --> 00:04:04,860
- I just don't believe
in this whole notion

143
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,735
of like, okay you graduate, and you work

144
00:04:06,735 --> 00:04:07,568
then get married, have kids and--

145
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:09,038
- You can pick up back from, come back

146
00:04:09,038 --> 00:04:10,740
and work here, you're in the same spot.

147
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,037
- Yeah, I also just don't think--

148
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:14,022
- I actually think it's,
the other way is risky.

149
00:04:14,022 --> 00:04:16,011
- Me too, because I think it's really

150
00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:18,690
easy to become complacent, and--

151
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,523
- 100%!

152
00:04:19,523 --> 00:04:21,838
- I don't know, I don't think it's

153
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:23,950
deviating from a path because I don't

154
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,260
think that there is a path.

155
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,712
- There's way too much respect for

156
00:04:26,712 --> 00:04:28,926
anybody who thinks what
you're doing is risky.

157
00:04:28,926 --> 00:04:30,970
- Yeah, I mean I've literally gotten

158
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,990
that response from like one person

159
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,273
but my family is like, "Yes, 100%, go"

160
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:35,160
- That's awesome.

161
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,650
- And they're so supportive.

162
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,650
- And the person that's,
you know, saying that,

163
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,250
is you know, respects a certain narrative

164
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,252
and that's awesome too.

165
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:43,730
- Right, and that's great for them.

166
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,824
- And may be great for them forever.

167
00:04:44,824 --> 00:04:45,880
- Right.
- May be.

168
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,793
- Right, but yeah I've always been

169
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:49,447
pushed and questioned a little bit,

170
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:50,280
- Yeah.

171
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,113
- So I knew that this was going to happen

172
00:04:51,113 --> 00:04:52,938
at some point, it was
just a matter of when.

173
00:04:52,938 --> 00:04:55,248
- Well, I'm happy to help when
you get through the process.

174
00:04:55,248 --> 00:04:57,864
- Thank you, yeah, I will definitely

175
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,870
hit you up on that at some point,

176
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,924
when I have kind of like, some clarity

177
00:05:01,924 --> 00:05:04,220
about life, and when I'm back.

178
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,710
If I come back, who knows.

179
