00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,800
- 12 years ago today,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,200
I asked somebody on my
team to run to BestBuy,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,570
pick up a little Canon camera, set it up,

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,760
I picked three bottles of wine,

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,950
I put them on a table, I filmed it,

6
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,650
first time I ever filmed anything

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,680
with the purpose of anybody seeing it.

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,570
Hello everyone, and welcome
to the first episode

9
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,330
of Wine Library TV.

10
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,340
I'm Gary Vaynerchuk,
director of operations

11
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,970
here at Wine Library and winelibrary.com.

12
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,970
And it started the process
of where we are here today,

13
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,480
12 years later.

14
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:34,086
(intense music)

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,620
When I hear people lacking patience

16
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,260
or wanting it so fast, or not
understanding the marathon,

17
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,400
I've basically been producing
content for the internet

18
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,210
for the last 12 years

19
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,390
and I really wish so many
of you could understand

20
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,230
how quick that's gone and
how much longer I have to go

21
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,130
but most of all, realize how much

22
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,492
didn't happen in those
first several years.

23
00:01:05,492 --> 00:01:08,160
(intense music)

24
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,420
How much I needed to persevere

25
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,540
and build an audience,

26
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,880
how much engaging and
applying people along the way

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,480
and building relationships and
hugging and kissing babies,

28
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,000
and grinding, and
believing and most of all

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,460
what's so interesting
is I sit here right now

30
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,100
outside this airport
knowing that 65% of you

31
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,330
didn't know who I was 24
months ago, 15 months ago.

32
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,330
At my current place of attention
is a current phenomenon,

33
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,530
it's a 15-16 month phenomenon

34
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,840
that things kind of took

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,700
a little bit of a hockey stick moment

36
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,300
which means 10 and a half years.

37
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,920
10 and a half years of
grinding and putting out stuff

38
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,620
and wanting to share my
thoughts on wine, on business,

39
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,210
on entrepreneurship, day in and day out.

40
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,100
Day in and day out, wow,
I worked all the time,

41
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,120
building businesses while this wasn't even

42
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,550
my full time thing.

43
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,140
I have so much empathy that you want it,

44
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,800
I have so much empathy and
want for you to get yours,

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,360
but Jesus, this doesn't happen overnight.

46
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,692
It just doesn't.

47
00:02:17,692 --> 00:00:00,000
(intense music)
