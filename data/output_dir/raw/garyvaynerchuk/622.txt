1
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,040
(audience applause
and cheers)

2
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,040
- Thanks for having me.

3
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,280
So I'm super excited for the Q&A
part and I'm gonna try to rush

4
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,240
into that as
quickly as possible.

5
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,080
But I'll give you a little bit
of my spiel, what's on my mind

6
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,600
right now and then hopefully

7
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,600
we can go into that Q&A.

8
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,400
I think the first thing I want
to talk about is the fact that

9
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,720
I think we're living through one

10
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,320
of the biggest culture
shifts of our time.

11
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,080
I mean look, 30% of this
audience right now is using a

12
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,640
cell phone to record this
conversation and are looking at

13
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,760
this talk through their device.

14
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,600
Which I'm all for,
don't put it away.

15
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,639
I actually think
that's exactly right.

16
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:15,120
And I think that one of the
great misnomers, for example,

17
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,000
so many of you are
doing online business.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,080
You get taught or
you get talking

19
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,760
about how do you monetize
from your website.

20
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,400
This, that and the other thing
and the next 24 to 36 months

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,600
most people are gonna consume

22
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,640
the entire internet
through a mobile device.

23
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,880
Yet, most of your websites are

24
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,240
completely optimized for
desktop computers and laptops.

25
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,880
Right?

26
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,920
This is the thing that
I spent all my time on.

27
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,880
What is really happening with
consumer behavior that most

28
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,080
people aren't
fully adjusting to?

29
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,440
Where is arbitrage?

30
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,920
The only thing I do for living
and why I have the audacity to

31
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,600
think that I can buy a
multibillion-dollar sports team

32
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,440
is that all my success has come
from a very simple move which is

33
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,960
day trading attention.

34
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,160
My asset, the thing that I most
care about, really you know,

35
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,600
if you sit in this room and
don't understand the importance

36
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,080
of this asset,
you'll become vulnerable

37
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,640
and not have as much upside.

38
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,360
The entire game is
predicated on attention.

39
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,840
Before you can tell me how great
your listing is that you're

40
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,200
selling or how great your
product is or how you how

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,640
amazing your nine week course
is, before you tell me how great

42
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,440
your shit is you've gotta
actually get my attention.

43
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,440
And in 2016 the supply and
demand of attention has become

44
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,200
extremely difficult
because we're getting thrown

45
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,200
at us so many things.

46
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,760
We are now living in a world
where information is being

47
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,320
pounded in our face 24/7/365
and the things that are gonna

48
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,160
break through are gonna actually
understand not only that you

49
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,440
have to produce great content
but way more importantly that

50
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,120
you have to understand the
context of the place where that

51
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,320
person is consuming the content.

52
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,680
If you're a real practitioner in
marketing you understand there's

53
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,600
a substantial difference between
a video that plays on Facebook,

54
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,200
that plays on YouTube
and that plays on Snapchat.

55
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,520
These are
fundamentally different things.

56
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,080
My mindset is different.

57
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,320
A 42-year-old female in the
United States that goes on

58
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,839
Pinterest and then 20 minutes
later goes on Facebook is the

59
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,160
same woman, with the same
income, with the same scenarios

60
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,320
but her mindset is different
when she's on Pinterest 'cause

61
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,160
she's got aspiration to buy
things versus when she's on

62
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,240
Facebook because she's keeping
up with her world yet every day

63
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,320
marketers in this room and
companies all over the world put

64
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,560
the same picture and
video in her feed thinking

65
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,400
it's gonna act the same way.

66
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,440
My friends, we are living
through the single biggest

67
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,040
culture shift, single biggest
culture shift of end consumer

68
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,520
attention since the
transition from the

69
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,280
radio to the television.

70
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,920
It's happening
right in front of you.

71
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,560
Right this second and yet so
many people in this room live

72
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,800
their lives one way but

73
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,600
they market a completely
different way, right?

74
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,040
One of the things that bothers
me the most especially the

75
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,360
homework, you know, these 21
hour traveling days allow you to

76
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,040
catch up on a lot of work and on
the way here I paid attention to

77
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,680
a lot of the people in this
room that have been tweeting or

78
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,080
Facebooking or emailing me
that they were gonna be here.

79
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,040
I took advantage and was able to
three or four hours of research

80
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,600
to really pay attention to what

81
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,480
some of you guys
are doing in this room.

82
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,720
And to be very honest with you
and I apologize I didn't want to

83
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,880
come to Sydney to razz but to
be very honest with you the far

84
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,480
majority of people in this room
that are marketing our marketing

85
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,040
in their best interest and

86
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,320
not in their consumer's
best interest.

87
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,200
The lack of patience, the lack
of
content that has anything to do

88
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,840
with other than what you want
them to do is quite stunning and

89
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,840
would be a very quick indicator
to me that the return on the

90
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,760
investment is not as great as
you'd like it to be because you

91
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,320
default into caring
about yourself first.

92
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,800
A lot of you consume my stuff,
you've heard my spiel,

93
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,200
I'm a big believer
that the people that

94
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,960
win deploy more value
than ask for in return.

95
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,640
When you're deploying as

96
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,400
I like to say 51% of
the value, you win.

97
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,800
As a lot you know, I don't
play the game of masterminds or

98
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,240
e-books or courses because I'm
very comfortable putting out my

99
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,040
content for free and then once

100
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,360
every three years
selling an $18 book.

101
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,720
I'm very comfortable
in that environment.

102
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,320
It's also the reason that
I think I'm able to build

103
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,680
$100 million businesses
that don't require me.

104
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,680
And really I'd like to pound

105
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,680
that thesis down this
collective room.

106
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,400
I think the one thing that I've
noticed has become very clear to

107
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,560
me that is a vulnerability and
it runs true across a lot of

108
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,280
demos is lack of patience.

109
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,800
If you really asked me what's
the telltale sign of somebody

110
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,120
who's really winning or is
capable of winning versus not

111
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,720
it's completely
predicated on patience.

112
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,120
You know, way too many
people aren't recognizing,

113
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,280
how 'bout this?

114
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,160
How many people in this room are
retiring in the next 10 years?

115
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,280
And I don't mean
you're gonna crush it.

116
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,920
I mean you're fucking
old and you're finished.

117
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,720
(audience laughter)

118
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,640
How many people in this room
are retiring in next 10 years?

119
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,520
Raise your hand.

120
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,480
Raise it high, don't be scared.

121
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,680
So for the six of you, four of
you, you could take a lot of

122
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,440
what I'm about to say
with a grain of salt. Right?

123
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,360
But for the majority of you,
I just want to remind all of you

124
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,440
that only 11 years ago
YouTube, Facebook,

125
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,480
smart phones, Twitter,

126
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,800
Snapchat,
Instagram it didn't exist.

127
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,640
Nothing existed 10 years ago

128
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,800
that is now at the
forefront of attention.

129
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
I grew up, actually how many

130
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,680
people here don't really know
my spiel? Raise your hand.

131
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,800
Just curious.
Good amount.

132
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,880
Great, perfect, I'll
go backwards then.

133
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,680
I grew up poor.

134
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,360
I was born in the Soviet Union.

135
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,720
I came to US when I was three.

136
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,840
My dad got a job at a liquor
store and eventually saved a lot

137
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,480
of money over a
seven year period.

138
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,360
Great shirt.

139
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,200
And, and, oh and you too.

140
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,960
(audience laughter)

141
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,280
And eventually owned a small
liquor store in New Jersey.

142
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,560
I grew up an entrepreneur.

143
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,320
Very hustler kid,
baseball cards,

144
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,840
lemonades stands,
things like that.

145
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,760
I got to my dad's
business at 14 and

146
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,520
at 17 I fell in love
with wine collecting.

147
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,200
I realized that people collected
wine the way I collected

148
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,039
baseball cards and memorabilia
and that became my passion point

149
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,520
to wanting to get
involved in my family business.

150
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,200
In 1996, I launched the second
ever e-commerce wine business in

151
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,640
America and from 1998 to 2005,

152
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,040
in a seven year window,
I built my dad's business

153
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,160
from a three to
a $65 million a year business.

154
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,360
So, my first business was

155
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,400
retail bricks and mortar
and e-commerce.

156
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,600
Not information, not
masterminds, not books,

157
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,680
not being me
just being an operator.

158
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,680
I didn't start talking about
business to the public

159
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,480
until I was 34 years old.

160
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,640
I built my foundation in

161
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,920
building a tangible
actual business.

162
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,760
That's what I come from,
that's who I am.

163
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,320
I'm currently the CEO of a

164
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,160
650 person digital
and social agency.

165
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,120
Kind of Madison Avenue
madmen 2016 business.

166
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,920
I grown that business from a
three to $100 million business

167
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,320
in the last five years.

168
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,200
I'm in the business of building
businesses, I just happen to

169
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,880
quite enjoy putting out
information that has an impact

170
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,840
on people along the way because
very honestly and this is quite

171
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,480
simple, I'm selfish off the high
that I get when I get an email

172
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,280
from somebody that has had
something good happen to them

173
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,920
based on my business advice.

174
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,280
That's where I'm at.

175
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,320
That's my life.
I don't--

176
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,360
(audience applause)

177
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,240
- Thank you.

178
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,880
I'm gonna make a lot more
money on my Uber stock and on my

179
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,440
Facebook stock than I'll ever
make being me or selling a book

180
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,920
or getting paid to speak.

181
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,560
What I like is being
historically correct.

182
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,800
What I like is knowing that
I was gifted with a way to

183
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,640
communicate that actually
gets through to people.

184
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,640
For example, 90% of the people
in this room are not willing to

185
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,720
work as hard
as their ambition. Right?

186
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,760
Let's just cut to the chase.

187
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,880
Do you know how many of
you are full of straight shit?

188
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,400
(audience laughter)

189
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,080
Let's cut right to the chase.

190
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,560
You talk a big game of what you

191
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,720
want but you're not
interested doing--

192
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,040
How many people in this room
watch DailyVee, my video blog?

193
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,960
Raise your hand.

194
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,680
So what this group knows versus
the half of the room, or third

195
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,840
of the room that raised their
hands that don't know me is that

196
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,200
I work 18 hours a day.

197
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,440
18.

198
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,840
That's what I do because I talk
a big game and I want big things

199
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,000
to happen and so you actually
have to put in the work.

200
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,840
Somebody in this room sent me a
Snapchat message couple hours

201
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,480
ago and said, "Gary, talk
to me about passive income."

202
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,760
Let me talk to all of
you about, passive income.

203
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,880
(audience laughter)

204
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,960
It doesn't fucking exist.

205
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,040
(audience laughter
and applause)

206
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,800
There's no fucking algorithm
that's gonna let you sit on the

207
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,120
fucking coast and drink
fucking champagne while

208
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,000
the money comes rolling in.

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,800
(audience laughter)

210
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,280
It doesn't exist and if
it does you're either doing

211
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,120
something illegal or something
that would make your spouse be

212
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,480
embarrassed of who you are.

213
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,640
I've been to enough bullshit
marketing conferences where

214
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,080
I've literally watched the
spouse of the person on stage

215
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,600
not feel comfortable telling

216
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,920
people how their husband
or wife makes money.

217
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,840
I have no interest in having a
legacy that I can't be proud of.

218
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,040
I also have no interest in
telling you how to make your

219
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,840
money or how you live your life.

220
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,080
I have no audacity or ability
even begin to think about that

221
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,440
but what I will tell
you is this, my friends.

222
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,680
In a 2016 world, right, in a
2016 world everybody in this

223
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,840
room is the patriarch and
matriarch of their family and

224
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,960
I would tell you that I live
under a very aggressive thesis

225
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,160
of how you make your money is
more important than how much you

226
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,720
make and I feel as though one of
the big messages that needs to

227
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,720
start being talked about is some
of the emotional intelligence

228
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,800
aspects of running a business.

229
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,520
I can stand here very
comfortably and tell a lot of

230
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,360
you that I'm not super
IQ'd out. I'm just not.

231
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,200
I'm not super smart when it
comes to just information

232
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,040
retention of shit
that's happened.

233
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,520
I've read seven books,
I've written four, right?

234
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,800
(audience laughter)

235
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,040
I'm not that smart.

236
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,240
I'm really not but what I can
tell you is on the flip side

237
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,240
when it comes to the
emotional intelligence, empathy,

238
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,840
self-awareness, gratitude,
intuition, I'm all-time.

239
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,200
As a matter of fact, in my will
right now, in my active will,

240
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,240
it says if humans ever figure
out how to measure emotional

241
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,000
intelligence, I want to
be dug up and tested.

242
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,480
(audience laughter)

243
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,840
Because I can't explain to you

244
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,240
how I know that every person in

245
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,080
this room is going
to be on Snapchat

246
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,680
or that every person is

247
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,800
going to eventually--

248
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,560
I know the fact that everybody
in this room 20 years from now

249
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,240
is to be sitting in their home
or whatever we're doing in

250
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,600
20 years and living through
virtual reality and that they'll

251
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,760
be struggling to understand
if this is real life

252
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,920
or if virtual reality
is real life.

253
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,880
I also know that 80% of his room
just heard me say that sentence

254
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,360
and said, "Get the
fuck outta here."

255
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,560
(audience laughter)

256
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,400
In the same way that I stood
in a room like this in 1996 and

257
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,080
said people were gonna buy wine
on the internet and everybody in

258
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,840
this room laughed at me.

259
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,040
Because the guy that
was sitting with me on stage

260
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,720
worked for the Yellow Pages.

261
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,040
I don't know if they have that
down here but the Yellow Pages

262
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,960
and made fun of me and said who
here, we were bantering and he

263
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,400
goes actually goes, "Who here
will buy wine on the internet?"

264
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,480
Nobody raised, could you
imagine being here right now and

265
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,480
watching this entire room,
nobody raises their hand.

266
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,200
(audience laughter)

267
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,520
I looked at him and I said,
"Honestly," and this was a

268
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,920
different world, I said, "I wish
this was being recorded because

269
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,040
"I will be
historically correct and

270
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,120
"all of you will be
historically wrong."

271
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,080
And so, I do that not
because I'm smart,

272
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,120
not because I know,

273
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,680
it's intuitive.
I can feel it.

274
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,520
I watch it.

275
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,320
I see little things
and I just feel it and

276
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
so here's what I can feel.

277
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,800
I want to make my money in a way
that makes me proud because

278
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,680
I don't want to have the
conversations with my

279
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,760
grandchildren about
how I made my money.

280
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,840
Everybody here needs to
understand everything you're

281
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,440
doing is being documented.

282
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,720
All of it.

283
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,120
Like every landing page you
create to convert someone,

284
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,920
everything is being documented
for ever and I'm watching so

285
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,240
many of my contemporaries and

286
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,040
friends chase money over their

287
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,840
good name, over the
way they're feel and

288
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,920
I'm very concerned about it.

289
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,520
I also know that everything
that you know today is

290
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,640
being disrupted heavily.

291
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,120
I know that the hotel industry,
this lovely hotel, the hotel

292
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,840
I'm staying in, I know that
five years ago none of them sat

293
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,160
there and said, okay what's your
biggest threat in five years?

294
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,480
They were worried
about each other.

295
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,840
Nobody's raised their hand at
the Four Season Hotel senior

296
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,200
staff meeting five years ago and
said what if somebody creates

297
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,880
like an eBay for people selling

298
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,200
each other their
rooms in their homes?

299
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,520
Nobody saw airBnB
coming in that industry.

300
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,400
The guy or gal that owned the
most taxi medallions in New York

301
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,720
City he or she didn't sit around
five years ago and said,

302
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,880
"You know, somebody might create
an app on the iPhone where

303
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,880
"people are gonna hit a button
and a limo is gonna come in

304
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,120
"two minutes and pick them up."

305
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,400
We are living, email,
I literally thought email was

306
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,920
the most indestructible core

307
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,960
communication funnel
in our society.

308
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,880
How many people in this room,
by show of hands, are familiar

309
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,640
with Slack or using Slack?

310
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,760
What's Slack?
Google that shit.

311
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,880
(audience laughter)

312
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,240
We don't have time
for that right now.

313
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,240
(audience laughter)

314
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,880
One more time, how
many people know Slack?

315
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:34,080
I don't predict Slack, I just
look at Slack and go holy fuck.

316
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,360
Gchat and email in my
organization has collapsed by

317
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,720
80% since we've installed Slack.

318
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,040
So, then I text Stuart
Butterfield, CEO, and I'm like,

319
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,720
"Can I invest?"

320
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,520
That's what I do for living.

321
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:52,640
We are living through a much
bigger culture shift than this

322
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,400
room it is respecting and

323
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,000
so what I want to
do is a couple things.

324
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,440
Number one, and Caleb it's fun
to have you here because I use

325
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,520
it as a proxy, I watched
Caleb from afar and I'm like you

326
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,079
better fucking talk about
14-year-old things not like he's

327
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,959
40 years old because
he's fucking 14, right?

328
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
And he's got a ton to add.

329
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,079
Especially, like what's actually
happening in 14 to 20-year-old

330
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,919
land but I don't think a
47-year-old in this room is

331
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,319
gonna respect a 14-year-old tell

332
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,399
him how to live
life when he's 14.

333
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,280
You need to stay in your lane.

334
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,920
Too many people want to be
something before they are.

335
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,760
You got plenty of time for that.

336
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,600
The bottom line is you need
is, if you're so advice,

337
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
please fucking know what
you're talking about.

338
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,440
(audience laughter)

339
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,400
And please as an audience we
need to start understanding like

340
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,680
there needs to be,
listen, everything can fly.

341
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,040
Everything can fly.

342
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,840
You can do anything you want but

343
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,520
I'd like to start employing
some common sense.

344
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,080
Wouldn't it make sense to take
business advice from somebody

345
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,160
that's actually built a business
versus the only business they've

346
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,120
ever had was to
give business advice.

347
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,880
Doesn't that fuckin'
make sense to you guys?

348
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,600
(audience laughter)

349
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,320
(audience applause)

350
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,880
I don't know.

351
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,280
Like, it fucking makes sense.

352
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,120
Attention arbitrage, I built
my brand on email, YouTube and

353
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,480
Twitter in 2006 or '07.

354
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
Back to the story.

355
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,680
I built a big business.

356
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,320
How did I build it?

357
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,720
How many people your done
email marketing in their lives?

358
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,880
Raise your hand.

359
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,640
Awesome.

360
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,360
In 1997, I had an email
newsletter for my wine business

361
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,360
200,000 people that had a 91%
open rate and 65% click through.

362
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,840
I'm no hero though.

363
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,680
It was because it was early.

364
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,400
Marketers hadn't
ruined email yet. Right?

365
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,520
We didn't ruin it yet.

366
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,000
I tried and I do and I'm trying
to ruin Snapchat right now.

367
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,480
That's what I do.

368
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,080
Show me with there's
attention, and I'm a salesman.

369
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,520
I want you to buy shit.

370
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,320
So I'm trying to figure out
how to sell you stuff on it.

371
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,000
That's what I did with

372
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,400
email while everybody
else had catalogs.

373
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,080
Then something came out,
it was called Google. Right?

374
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,360
I was intrigued by it 'cause

375
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,560
they this ad product
called AdWords.

376
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,960
The day it came out I owned the

377
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,240
word "wine" on Google
for five cents a click.

378
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,560
And I owned it for 9 1/2 months
before anybody bid me up because

379
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,360
people still didn't
know what it was.

380
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,240
How many people here are

381
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,640
actively creating content
for their business?

382
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,800
And by the way, if you raise
your hand I will jump out here

383
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,840
pick you and if you're
not actually doing it,

384
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,320
I'm gonna ruin
your personal brand.

385
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,760
(audience laughter)

386
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,520
So ready?

387
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,520
How many people in this room are
actually producing content right

388
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,360
now for their
business on Snapchat?

389
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,880
Raise your hand.

390
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,360
Seven.

391
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,760
Meanwhile, it is the fastest

392
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,080
growing attention
graph in the world.

393
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,640
Now, to your credit it is
absolutely a 13 to 25-year-old

394
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,840
thing which may not work for a
lot of you but here's the key.

395
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,040
It's like running a marathon.

396
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,240
If you're gonna run a marathon,

397
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,760
it's probably good
to run a 5K first.

398
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,320
If you're gonna run a marathon,
it's probably good to train on

399
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,480
the treadmill before
you do it. Right?

400
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,760
So the reason so many more hands
in this room should've went up

401
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,760
for Snapchat was in 24 months,
much like Facebook, the far

402
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,720
majority of 30 to 50-year-olds,
actually I'm gonna go with 25 to

403
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,000
45, 25 to 42 will be on it and
it will have more attention on

404
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,680
it then a lot of
things you've done.

405
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,720
That same newsletter on my email
service now has a 36% open rate.

406
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,920
It's bigger, I'm much better
at it, it's things I've learned

407
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,320
yet it can't be as good because
the supply and demand of

408
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,160
attention everybody has
an email newsletter now.

409
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,920
I amassed a million followers on

410
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,240
Twitter because
I attacked it in 2007.

411
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,040
I rode it and now it's declining
and I'm not emotional about it.

412
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,400
I'm getting far less engagement,
far less reach, far less

413
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,800
business results for my Twitter

414
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,360
account than
I did 36 months ago.

415
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,920
Do I cry that it's over?

416
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,400
No, I do not.

417
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,280
The level of crying when
something's over is disgusting.

418
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,000
(audience laughter)

419
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,080
I'm sorry that your conversion
from your affiliate marketing or

420
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,680
your JV email newsletters
doesn't work as well.

421
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,360
Get the fuck over it.

422
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,960
The market changes.

423
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,600
Nobody cares
about your feelings.

424
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,440
The market doesn't care.

425
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,240
The market doesn't care.

426
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,120
You care, I care but the market
doesn't and unfortunately for

427
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,320
everybody in this room,
the market is what matters.

428
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,400
And so what happens is what
I see from far is people,

429
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,120
you know, I always tell my
buddies the quickest way to go

430
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,520
out of business is to be
romantic about how

431
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,560
you make your money.

432
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,400
The quickest way to go out of
business is being romantic about

433
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,120
how you make your money.

434
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,600
A lot of you in this room,

435
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,280
historically, have
found an arbitrage.

436
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,200
Something worked. Right?

437
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,360
Whether it was email or Google
AdWords or affiliate marketing

438
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,160
or banner retargeting or JV'ing
or whatever the hell it was.

439
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,280
Videos on YouTube.

440
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,200
Whatever it was, right?

441
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,880
Joint venture,
yeah, she got you.

442
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,600
I see you.

443
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,240
Your homie's got you.

444
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,320
(audience laughter)

445
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,120
Whatever it is,
you've found it, right?

446
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,440
Right now, I think one of the

447
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,120
great arbitrages is
Instagram influencers. Right?

448
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,720
I think one of the most
underpriced things to do right

449
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,880
now is to go to Instagram
accounts that have a lot of

450
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,240
followers, see them, hopefully
they have their Gmail account in

451
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,800
the in their profile which many

452
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,160
of them do 'cause
they want the money.

453
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,480
You email them and you ask
them the price to do a sponsored

454
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,600
post, natively and integrate
it and it works extremely well.

455
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,760
It is by far the execution
that I most excited about for my

456
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,840
current book and is doing
extremely well because that's

457
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,640
where the attention is and those
prices will go up as people, as

458
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,920
they get 15 emails a day instead
of one, the price goes up.

459
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,640
It's just these levers.

460
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,720
I'm desperate to pound this
down everybody's throat because

461
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,560
what's gonna happen over next 10
years is we're gonna have 4 to 7

462
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,960
to 11 shifts in the marketplace.

463
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,440
Over the next decade,
you will have 4 to 7

464
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,800
to 11 shifts in the marketplace.

465
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,920
If you are doing email marketing
everything was fine until Google

466
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,640
and Gmail decided to
create a promotions tab.

467
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,200
That wasn't good.

468
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,880
And everything was great for the
Twitter influencers like me in

469
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,080
2010, '11, and '12 when
everybody's attention was there.

470
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,160
But then it was gone.

471
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,640
It's no different than
a hit television show.

472
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,960
When there's a hit television
show, the big brands in the

473
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,800
world want to run ads and
commercials during that show.

474
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
Eventually that show is not
popular anymore and

475
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,920
those ads aren't as good.

476
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,120
This dynamic is playing

477
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,040
through every single
day in this marketplace.

478
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,760
The problem is in,
at this level,

479
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,400
is people are holding on

480
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,440
and they're not educating

481
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,560
themselves on what's
happening next.

482
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,400
They're making
emotional decisions.

483
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,720
I love when people tell me this.

484
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,920
People are like, "Gary, but
you have to understand,

485
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,720
"I didn't grow
up with this stuff."

486
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,080
(single man laughing)

487
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,760
And I'm like, you like that?
(audience laughter)

488
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,120
That was a great
laugh, thank you.

489
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
I'm like, "That's right, Ron.

490
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,200
"But you didn't grow up driving
and you figured that out."

491
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,120
Right?

492
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,440
There's way too much emotion at
the 30, 40 and 50-year-old level

493
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,760
that they didn't
grow up in this.

494
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,680
I've got news alert.

495
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,080
I didn't grow up with it either.

496
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,520
At the time that
I was 18 years old,

497
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,880
I had spent 20 minutes
on a computer my life.

498
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,520
I didn't grow up with it.

499
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,840
I just figured it out.

500
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,880
I love how people don't
realize that putting in work

501
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,120
and learning is one of the

502
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,080
requisites for
building a business.

503
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,880
Like literally
when I'm like,

504
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,640
"Hey, you need to
learn Instagram."

505
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,040
"Really?"
(audience laughter)

506
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,400
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

507
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,000
Yes, really.
(audience laughter)

508
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,280
Like, yes, really yes
You have to learn.

509
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,080
It's a weird thing.

510
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,520
You have to know what the fuck
is going on in the world, yes.

511
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,120
And so, look here's
what I see happening;

512
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,320
the market's moving
faster than ever.

513
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,400
These generations of attention
are not lasting as long.

514
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,080
Facebook, the reason
they created an algorithm,

515
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,480
where all of you
got mad that you can't

516
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,600
reach everybody,
it was to save the

517
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,920
platform because if everybody
saw everything from everybody

518
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,320
we'd all be gone from
Facebook a long time ago.

519
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,600
The reason they
created an algorithm

520
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,000
is now people are still on it.

521
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,160
As a matter of fact, people are
spending more time on Facebook

522
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,080
today than 36 months ago because

523
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,280
their tweaking
the algorithm so well.

524
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,440
It's so interesting to
watch this play out.

525
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,120
A lot of other
platforms haven't.

526
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,880
Whether Facebook or Instagram or
Snapchat are here in 36 months

527
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,880
from now or not, I don't know.

528
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,680
Truth is I don't care.

529
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,880
What I know is that I'm going

530
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,960
to consistently pay attention
to what's emerging.

531
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,960
If you are not following this
narrative and if you do not

532
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,520
understand in this narrative
that one of the most important

533
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,560
things to do is to create
quality content and you've heard

534
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,280
this clichéd bullshit
marketing talk your whole life.

535
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,480
The problem is it's true.

536
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,800
The problem with the cliché
thing like you have to produce

537
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,240
content that's
valuable to sell shit,

538
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,120
the problem with
it is it's true.

539
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,520
It's true.

540
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,560
You have to provide value and
more importantly you're only as

541
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,760
good as your last at-bat.

542
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,880
You're only as good as
your last piece of content.

543
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,000
You're only as good as that.

544
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,880
These logos, these logos,

545
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,480
you have to understand
what's happening.

546
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,360
This.

547
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,080
I think we can all agree that
this becoming a very important

548
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,080
thing in our lives, right?

549
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,800
Thank you.

550
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,080
It's my hotel key.

551
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,360
(audience laughter)

552
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:35,680
This is a very important
thing in our lives, right?

553
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,640
And I think this is quickly
becoming the television

554
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,560
and the television is
becoming the radio.

555
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,000
Now this is super important
because of the following.

556
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
How many people in this room
now, in every 24 hour window,

557
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,200
including when they sleep are

558
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
always within arm's
reach of their telephone?

559
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,520
I mean, it is literally the
preview of us becoming robots.

560
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,080
Literally, it is.

561
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,080
So this is the most
important device in our lives.

562
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,040
Do you know how
important this has become to me?

563
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,920
Literally, I would rather
somebody roll up on me in

564
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,720
New York City, steal my wallet
and stab me in the stomach

565
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,800
with a knife then lose my phone.

566
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,480
(audience laughter)
That's how important it is.

567
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,680
So, my friends, this
if you agree as I do.

568
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,680
How many people here are
lucky enough to have a 13 to

569
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:35,440
18-year-old grandchild or
sibling or child in their lives?

570
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,680
Raise your hand.

571
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,520
I think you guys
know, this is it.

572
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,160
Not even the laptop.

573
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,160
As a matter of fact, even, old
dude, 40 years old I now only

574
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,360
travel with my phone.

575
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,760
I no longer need my laptop.

576
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,960
I do everything on this device.

577
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,840
The average 15-year-old in the
world, not America, in the world

578
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,320
when coming home goes to their
room and spends all of their

579
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,760
attention time on this.

580
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,640
There is no television.

581
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,920
There's no going
through their direct mail.

582
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,000
There's no shit like that.

583
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,760
There's no going your landing
page optimization horse shit.

584
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,880
It's this.
(audience laughter)

585
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,520
And here's where it starts
getting really serious for me.

586
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,800
Because I view social media
and I know, I did my homework,

587
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,440
I know where social media sits
in this room as importance.

588
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,800
Let me give you a quick preview.

589
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,760
Shit.
(audience laughter)

590
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,200
Social media, my friends,

591
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,040
there's no such thing
as social media.

592
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,360
It's a word.

593
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,240
Let me tell you
what social media is.

594
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,120
Social media is the slang term

595
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,560
for the current state
of the internet.

596
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,040
And when you wrap your
head around that shift all of a

597
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,800
sudden it's not as easy
to kind of like diss it.

598
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,720
And if you wrap your head around
the following data, you'll start

599
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,160
paying real close attention.

600
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,400
This is the most important
tool and not just by the way to

601
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,600
14-year-old girls.

602
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,360
Do you know that on Instagram
the fastest growing demo taking

603
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,560
selfies are 42 to
45-year-old females?

604
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,600
Literally, cougar selfies.

605
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,680
(audience laughter)

606
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,320
So, this is the most
important device in the world.

607
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,480
This were all of you are
gonna sell your homes and your

608
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,920
information and your
office space from.

609
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,360
Wrap your head around it.

610
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,840
That's where it's gonna
be words can be sold.

611
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,000
And now follow me, those
five logos and the other seven

612
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,560
websites that are important in
social media,

613
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,640
they represent 53%

614
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,360
of all minutes
spent on a cell phone.

615
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:43,160
More than half the time of every
consumer, all ages, across the

616
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:49,200
board, is spent on those
platforms and most of you aren't

617
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,680
doing dick on any of them.
(audience laughter)

618
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,320
Zero, goose egg and if
you are you're mailing it in.

619
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,360
You're putting some
random bullshit.

620
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,400
You are playing in a place where
it's email, it's your website.

621
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,520
Your website that many of you,
by the way, three of you,

622
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,240
three of you, I don't
know you guys are.

623
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,360
Three of you when I went to

624
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,560
your website weren't
even mobile optimized.

625
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,840
Weren't even native
to a mobile device.

626
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,280
And you know who you guys are.

627
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,800
You haven't even made your
website work on a mobile device.

628
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,680
Even though in the next 24
months three-fourths of all

629
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,120
internet consumption will
happen through a mobile device.

630
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,640
So, I don't know.

631
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,760
I don't know what
you're waiting for.

632
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,200
I don't know what
process you're interested in.

633
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,360
What thing you're gonna do but
what I do know is that you think

634
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,000
that your customer is
not on it and they are.

635
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,240
That's your vulnerability.

636
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,520
I know what's happening.

637
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,000
You think your 49-year-old Sally
and your 57-year-old Stan

638
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,360
is not on it and that's who you
sell to and that's why you

639
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,680
disrespect it because
what you're doing is you're

640
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,960
disrespecting what's
actually happening in the world.

641
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,800
For example, how many people

642
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,960
this room have sent an emoji
via text? Raise your hand.

643
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,040
Raise your hands high.

644
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,960
I want everybody to look around.

645
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,680
This is not a 14-year-old
audience except for Caleb.

646
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,200
This is not--
(audience laughter)

647
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,680
This is not a 14-year-old
audience yet

648
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,760
36 months ago most of you

649
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,160
didn't know what an emoji
was and now here we are today

650
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,520
36 months later and there are
60-year-old men literally

651
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,800
texting OMG and sending
shit emojis to each other.

652
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,120
(audience laughter)

653
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,360
It's the truth and you know
it because what you haven't

654
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,160
realized is the following;

655
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,640
what technology is doing is
aging down people.

656
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,760
Guys, what technology is doing

657
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,320
right now is it's
aging down people.

658
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,560
If you're lucky enough to be
sitting here right now and you

659
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,960
are of the age and you're
fortunate that your parents are

660
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,880
still alive and you're of the
age where you could remember

661
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,520
your parent at the
age you are right now.

662
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,680
If you're lucky enough right
now, stick with me, that you're

663
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,760
lucky enough to know your parent
that you're a kid and you knew

664
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,360
your parent at the age you are
right now, let me give you a

665
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,400
preview, you are much younger

666
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,480
than they were
at this age for them.

667
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,920
You should, the average
45-year-olds dress and actions,

668
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,040
what she spends money on maps a

669
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,520
28-year-old woman
only 10 years ago.

670
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:34,240
Technology is bringing our age
down quickly and so you will

671
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,320
quickly be on Snapchat because
for the 32-year-old woman going

672
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,560
to be cool and important to be
on Snapchat in 40 seconds if it

673
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,160
isn't already and in LA,

674
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,480
New York and San Francisco
it already is. Got it?

675
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,880
This is just historical.

676
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,360
This is what happens and so what
I know is this entire room wakes

677
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,600
up in five years, five, 

678
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,760
I know there're six of
you retiring in 10

679
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,520
but this entire room wakes up
in five years and your customer

680
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,760
that's gonna sign million-dollar
leases and buy--

681
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,120
My entire social network,
my actual friends, four of them

682
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,280
have bought $3 million homes or

683
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,840
above through
social media in the last year.

684
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,800
My buddy just bought a
$700,000 watch from Instagram.

685
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,080
You know what I call that?

686
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,840
ROI.

687
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,640
GE one of the biggest
brands in the world, we sold a

688
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,200
multi-hundred million
dollar jet engine on LinkedIn.

689
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
Not by spamming them either.

690
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,720
Content.

691
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,720
If you do not understand that
every single person in this room

692
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,240
is now a media company,

693
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,320
then you don't understand
what's happening.

694
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,040
If you do not understand that
you are a media company first

695
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,160
and then you sell homes if you
do not understand that you're a

696
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,560
media company first
and then you sell wine.

697
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,160
If you don't understand that
your media company first and

698
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,120
then sell clothes or information
or this that and the other

699
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,000
thing, then you are not
understanding what's actually

700
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,080
happening and you are going
to be in deep fucking shit.

701
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,480
(audience laughter)
And I mean it because

702
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,920
I promise you this, my friends,

703
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,719
much bigger companies than yours

704
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,799
and I have been
disrupted by technology.

705
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,600
Borders and Barnes & Noble's
were better businesses than

706
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,480
yours when Amazon came along.

707
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,360
And this is happening at
scale and what you don't know if

708
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,600
you're not completely all-in
on this is what happens when

709
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,760
there's exponential
scale of maturity.

710
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,600
The internet is 20 years old.

711
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,960
And I know there's some,

712
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,920
"Actually in 19," I know, nerd,
but I mean--

713
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,239
(audience laughter)
I mean the consumer internet.

714
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:45,799
When normal people have
gone on it is 20 years old.

715
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,360
If you look at the growth of
everything that's happened in

716
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,520
the last five years, 
it is insane.

717
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,320
Yet globally still only 11
to 14% of the e-commerce is

718
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,040
happening on the internet.

719
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:01,160
It's just started and if you are
not adjusting to this reality

720
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,680
you are massively vulnerable.

721
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,320
So while this room 

722
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,160
spends a lot of time on tactics,
and by the way,

723
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,760
tactics are massively
important and I'm pretty aware

724
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,600
of the programming here,
tomorrow really fucking matters.

725
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,640
Those tactics are
gonna really matter.

726
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,680
They matter because
tomorrow matters.

727
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,320
And next Thursday matters and
the following Sunday matters.

728
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,000
Right?

729
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,240
You're living now but the bottom
line is everybody's way too

730
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,000
addicted to the quick tactic.

731
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,360
What's gonna make me money
tomorrow while not recognizing

732
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,280
the macro trend that is looming.

733
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,000
If you aren't, I mean I never,
I'm constantly spending 20%, 30%

734
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,200
of my money and energy on shit
that doesn't have a prayer to

735
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,720
bring me any value in the
first year that I do it.

736
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,920
That's called building a brand.

737
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,560
That's called building
a long-term business.

738
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,120
That's called actually building
for something more than the cash

739
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,240
flow that I make that year and
that is been the separator for

740
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,360
me in my career, that is the
separator for people that win at

741
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,720
the highest levels and even
if your ambition stays quite

742
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,280
humble, it's a prerequisite
to not be put out of business.

743
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,640
It's just the way it is.

744
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,960
Now, how much time do I have?

745
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,120
Good?

746
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,640
- [Woman] I'm not sure,
how much time does he have?

747
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,840
(audience chatter)

748
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,680
I'm gonna go 10 more minutes

749
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,000
and then I'm going
to do some Q&A.

750
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,560
I want to spend 10 minutes
on emotional intelligence.

751
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,760
My friends, in America, which
is the number one competitive

752
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,320
entrepreneurial market in the
world, to be in the top

753
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,600
1% of earners in America you
have to make $400,000 a year.

754
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,280
I really want to start
talking about practicality.

755
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,400
This whole notion that everybody
has to make millions and

756
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,400
millions and millions
of dollars is insanity.

757
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,720
We have to recognize if you
actually have the talent to be

758
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,080
able to do that.

759
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,280
Building an actual
business takes talent.

760
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,480
You don't get to just build a
million dollar business 'cause

761
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,760
you read a fucking book or
'cause you want it or 'cause

762
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,880
"The Secret" is gonna fucking

763
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,720
help you do if
you wish for it enough.

764
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,440
(audience laughter)

765
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,360
It's not how shit works.

766
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,760
There's no 17 step
process if you suck.

767
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,200
(audience laughter)

768
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,200
There's no 17 fucking step
process for me to be fucking the

769
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,400
best basketball
player in the world.

770
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,160
It does exist.

771
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,320
There's no 17 step process
to make the fucking Beyoncé.

772
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,480
It doesn't exist.

773
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,280
(audience laughter)

774
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,520
We have to, at all costs,
reframe the conversation of

775
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,800
entrepreneurship and
building businesses.

776
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,600
If you actually took a step back
and became honest with yourself

777
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,920
and deployed self-awareness and
understood what you were good at

778
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,840
and what you were bad at.

779
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,160
I understood that
I was built like a robot.

780
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,960
That I don't need to drink,
that I don't need to eat,

781
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,160
that I don't need to fucking
sleep, well I need to sleep,

782
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,760
let me rephrase but I definitely
don't need to eat and drink.

783
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,400
Right?

784
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,200
To work 18 hours a day and that
is my competitive advantage.

785
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,080
I don't work 18 hours a
day because it's fun.

786
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,000
I don't work 18 hours a
day 'cause it's cool.

787
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,840
I don't work 18 hours a
day for kicks and giggles.

788
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,440
I work 18 hours a day because
I want to win, I want something

789
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,080
and it is the thing that I can

790
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,320
do better than
anybody I've ever met.

791
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,600
I've never met anybody in
my entire life who can work

792
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,960
18 hours a day, every day,
forever until they die.

793
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,240
That's me!

794
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,920
My brother can't do that.

795
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:26,120
Nobody I've ever met can do that
and so they shouldn't do that.

796
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,080
A lot of people I meet can
fucking destroy it in nine hours

797
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,520
and have algorithmic heads
and could do amazing things and

798
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,280
they're the closest people I've
ever seen the passive income

799
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,320
because they run math arbitrage
and scale against markets and

800
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,880
that's God bless.

801
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,520
Everybody in here has three to
four core things that they're

802
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,880
better at within themselves than
everything else they do and the

803
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,520
quicker that every one of you
looks in the mirror and actually

804
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,040
has that honest moment with
yourself and starts to deploy

805
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,000
all, I didn't say some, all of
your energy against those three

806
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,400
or four things the quicker
you will maximize everything

807
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,920
starting with happiness,
followed by money.

808
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,760
We are spending way too much
time and energy trying to be

809
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,240
good at things that
we can't be good at.

810
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,080
It's just real talk and there

811
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,920
is a how big is the
business you said?

812
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,720
I just heard you.

813
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,560
The information business?

814
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,960
How big was that?

815
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,520
Good, that entire fucking
business is built on telling

816
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,080
people how to fix things they

817
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,640
suck at when they
can't maximize it.

818
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,880
That's the truth.

819
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,520
Way too many
people can't get there.

820
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,680
It is against everything
you hear from everybody.

821
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,440
I get it.

822
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,560
I understand how I sit on this
island very by myself in the

823
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:43,640
ecosystem, but fuck man,
let me say this: think about the

824
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,880
thousand people that are the
most famous and successful in

825
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,760
the world and they all have
only one thing in common.

826
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,600
They fucking punted everything
besides that one talent and

827
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,040
spent every fucking minute in
their lives on that one talent.

828
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,600
(audience applause)

829
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,440
That's their common trait.

830
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,720
Now, now, does that not mean

831
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,280
that you could be the best

832
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,680
entrepreneur that you could
be if you put in the tactics?

833
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,000
Absolutely but you better be
ready to swallow that that means

834
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,040
that you make 87,000 a year

835
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,480
'cause that's the
talent that you have.

836
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,920
You could've made 42,
you did the process,

837
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,920
you put in the work,
you tried really hard.

838
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,160
You fuckin' really wanted
it and now you make 87.

839
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,520
That's pretty good.

840
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,320
I could be a much better jump
shooter if I fucking took a

841
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,920
1,000 jump shots every day
playing basketball

842
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,320
but I still don't think I'm
getting in the NBA.

843
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,160
(audience laughter)

844
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,320
And the reason I'm coming with
this to end is the following,

845
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,000
not because I want to be Debbie
Downer, not because I want to be

846
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,240
like, "Look, I'm a really good
entrepreneur and you're not."

847
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,440
It's because if you start
betting on your strengths maybe

848
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,000
you're just organized, maybe
your great operator, maybe you

849
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,240
should be a number two or number
three in somebody's organi--

850
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,200
guys, the gal that was number
30 at Facebook made a fuck load

851
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,480
more money than a lot
of us being on our own.

852
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,280
There's a lot of ways to go
about it that aren't predicated

853
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,360
on just being the
number one and being that.

854
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,480
It is an absolute real
conversation that needs to start

855
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,000
happening in entrepreneur-land
and business-land of actual

856
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,200
self-awareness to
strengths and weaknesses.

857
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,640
It has to happen.

858
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,400
It has to happen.

859
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,240
The data is not on the side of
the current narrative and

860
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,680
so we need to deploy it.

861
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:29,160
Again, you can absolutely
maximize your marketing skills.

862
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,680
You can absolutely be a better
copywriter today then you were a

863
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:37,360
month ago if you practice and
you see the results but please,

864
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:43,120
please understand that practical
optimism is an absolute

865
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:47,680
blueprint for
success versus blind hope.

866
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,840
It's real.

867
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,120
It's real and you
know the funny part is?

868
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,320
Most of you know it.

869
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,720
Most of you know it deep down in

870
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:59,760
your belly and so
what is it all mean?

871
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,960
It means that you only have so
much time and energy and if you

872
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,280
can figure out what to deploy

873
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,280
it against you will
maximize success.

874
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,760
And I think it's a very
important time to start having

875
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:15,080
that conversation because there
is other things that happened.

876
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:19,200
There's tough markets,
there's downturns in economies,

877
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,000
there's other variables and
that's where betting on your

878
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,040
strengths has
the biggest upside.

879
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,280
So as we head in to Q&A,

880
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,600
what I really want to
focus on is attention.

881
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,640
You know, like
attention is the asset.

882
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,640
It's the asset.

883
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,400
I mean if you just spend your
time trying to understand where

884
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,680
people's attention is and where
is it overpriced and where is it

885
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,120
underpriced, you will
make a lot of money.

886
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,160
If your competitors are buying
ads in newspapers and sending

887
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,320
direct mail while you're doing
Google AdWords and Facebook,

888
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,440
you will make a lot of money.
You just will.

889
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,040
As a matter of fact, as a
tactic, I would highly recommend

890
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,480
spending a lot more time
surveying and asking your

891
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,240
friends and
customers what they do.

892
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,360
I mean it.

893
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,920
You know what's one my
favorite things to do?

894
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,400
Look at the home,
actually, you know what?

895
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,480
Everybody do this real quick.

896
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,680
Look at your phone.

897
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,000
You know wheat's really
interesting about your phone?

898
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And this is why I grab so
many people's phones when I'm

899
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,680
traveling, if you look at the
home screen of your phone you

900
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,760
would be blown away how big of
an indicator the apps on your

901
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,480
home screen are to
who you actually are.

902
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,120
If you really look
at it, it's stunning.

903
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,840
I can like when I interview
people for like type A jobs

904
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,480
actually grab their phone a lot
to make sure there's like a lot

905
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:38,280
of like Evernote and calendars
and organize shit on there.

906
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,520
It is an unbelievable indicator
onto who you are and a great

907
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,840
insight into what that person's
about and things of that nature.

908
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,720
These are the places that
we need deploy our energy.

909
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,360
Attention and self-awareness.

910
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:57,200
They are the rocks of high
success in the future market.

911
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,400
Thank you.

912
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,880
(audience
applause and cheering)

913
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,320
- Alright, cool,

914
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,720
 so I guess 
#AskGaryVee show live.

915
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,280
- [Gary] Yes, let's do it.
- You up for that?

916
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,720
Can you do Q&A?
I don't know.

917
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,200
- [Gary] Hell yeah, let's do it.
- I'm just kidding, man.

918
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,520
200 shows, we up to 191.
- We're up to 191.

919
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,520
- Good. Is this episode 191?
I don't know.

920
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,440
- What's your name, my man?

921
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,520
- My name's Ross.
- Ross.

922
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,040
- [Ross] Gary, you sold me on
Snapchat, I'm convinced.

923
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:29,440
- [Gary] Yes.

924
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,000
- [Ross] I see the
value for personal brands.

925
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,720
- [Gary] Yes.

926
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,600
- [Ross] And I see the value
for big corporate logo brands.

927
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,240
- [Gary] Yes.

928
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,440
- What I'm missing is how do
I use it as a small logo brand?

929
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,640
Where like behind the scenes
isn't really that interesting

930
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,080
for my customers.

931
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,480
- Why would it be interesting
for a personal brand but

932
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,280
not a small business?

933
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,120
Very quick, you're just looking
for the excuse in this scenario.

934
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,720
It's always the story, right?

935
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,000
Why would it be big business and
why would it be one person but

936
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,960
not a small business?

937
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,960
What you have to do is
figure out how to make the

938
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,320
small business
interesting, right?

939
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,160
Now, the mistake a lot of people
make is they think they need to

940
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,640
be a charismatic individual
to help their small business.

941
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,320
Right?

942
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,920
The truth is you need to
think about your genre. Right?

943
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,680
There's a lot of things, for
example, I know there's a lot of

944
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,720
real estate people, I think the
most interesting thing that a

945
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,960
real estate agent can do
is own their territory.

946
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,880
So, for example, a small
business, an eight person real

947
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,480
estate firm is a small
business logo, right?

948
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,560
I think they should go and
interview all 100 people that

949
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,840
matter in that town.

950
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,000
The principal, the person
that owns the bagel shop.

951
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,640
The person that's lived
there the longest in town.

952
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,280
You see where I'm going?

953
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,840
Being a content producer is hard
but it's equally as hard for a

954
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,000
big business as it
is for a person as it is

955
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,120
for a mid-sized business.

956
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,520
They're all hard.

957
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,040
There's a lot of people, the far
majority of people don't win as

958
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:48,960
a big business.

959
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,160
The far majority of people
don't win as a individual.

960
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,000
The far majority don't
win as a small business.

961
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,400
What you need to do is figure
out what the right story is that

962
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,600
brings people value regardless
of where you sit there.

963
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,520
- [Ross] Great, thank you.
- [Gary] You got it, brother.

964
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,400
Questions.

965
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,480
- [Kim] Hey Gary.
- What's your name?

966
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,160
- [Kim] Kim. I was on
episode 172 of #AskGaryVee.

967
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,920
- Awesome, man.
(audience laughter)

968
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,800
- My question for you is I'm in
marketing and marketing business

969
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,720
it seems that a lot of people
trying to replicate what you do.

970
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,600
They're puting out
content which is awesome.

971
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,440
What's your recommendation on
them standing out in the field

972
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,840
of people that are
trying to play at that level?

973
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,640
- I think the way I stand out
is I don't follow anybody else.

974
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,520
All I do is follow people and
then I'm the first to report on

975
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,000
things and that's my
competitive advantage.

976
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,560
I think one of the mistakes a
lot of people do is they think

977
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:41,160
it's a good strategy to follow
thought leaders regurgitate it

978
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,480
and then be micro versions of
that and they pick up the scraps

979
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,480
and they do but you not to stand
out because by nature if you're

980
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,760
following, you're following.

981
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,760
What I would tell marketers to
do is actually, so I have such a

982
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,280
big advantage, I market for
the biggest brands in the world.

983
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,840
I market for Wine Library.

984
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,000
I market for my own book.

985
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,720
I sold 120,000 copies of
#AskGaryVee this week.

986
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,240
(audience cheers)

987
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,600
Do you know how many marketing
gurus sell 2,000, 3,000 copies

988
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,320
for the whole week
when it launched?

989
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,640
Again, this is why want the

990
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,480
whole market to
become way more cynical.

991
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,920
If you go look at the people
that are selling advice and they

992
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,360
have a book and they sell 6,000
copies for the whole fucking

993
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,760
first month, there's a problem.

994
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,960
Because aren't you supposed to
use that marketing advice to

995
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,600
sell your fucking shit?

996
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,040
(audience laughter)

997
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,360
Like, seriously?

998
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,920
What I would say is go out and
do marketing like if you going

999
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,120
to be marketing advice, go and
do marketing that has nothing to

1000
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,760
do with marketing advice,
see how it actually works and

1001
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,160
then go report on how it works.

1002
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,400
Yeah.

1003
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,200
 Is it on?
Just yell.

1004
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,360
- [Woman 2] Testing, testing.
- There we go.

1005
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,600
- [Emil] Awesome.
- What's your name?

1006
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,680
- [Emil] I'm Emil Buggies,

1007
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,760
I actually flew down
from Japan to come

1008
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,880
see you, I'm a big fan.
- Thank you.

1009
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,880
(audience applause)

1010
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,640
- Thank you so much.
- [Emil] Thank you, yeah.

1011
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,000
And I'm looking
forward to reading the book.

1012
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,040
I downloaded the audiobook

1013
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,360
as well 'cause
I heard it's a different--

1014
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,360
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.

1015
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,120
- [Emil] In Japan I do
a lot of airBnB things.

1016
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,800
Right now I'm renting out a lot
of apartments and listing them

1017
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,960
on airBnB so airBnB management
type stuff but the end user

1018
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,040
comes through airBnB.

1019
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,040
We don't really have
direct access to--

1020
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:32,720
- To them.

1021
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,480
- [Emil] business or platform so
how does a business like us go

1022
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,760
about promoting ourselves?

1023
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,760
- So how are you
guys organized as?

1024
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,560
Are you buying these?

1025
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,760
Are you
representing the apartment?

1026
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,800
What's you act, like how's
your business structured?

1027
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,440
- [Emil] So we just we
rent apartments, okay, but--

1028
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,240
- And then list them.

1029
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,000
- [Emil] And then
list them, yeah.

1030
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,880
- You're arbitraging airBnB.
- [Emil] Exactly.

1031
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,080
- I think you need to create
a consumer facing either,

1032
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:04,160
like again, this is in, back
to your similar question.

1033
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,120
This is where I love this
question, this is where I think

1034
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,880
I separate myself
from a lot of marketers.

1035
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:12,240
Okay that's what you do but what
you can do is be a level up.

1036
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,880
Again, think of content and
being a media com--,

1037
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,720
if you're a media company first
like I saw a lot of you react

1038
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,040
when I said your
media company first.

1039
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,920
If you thought like that, 

1040
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,160
you do apartment 
arbitrage you wouldn't

1041
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,600
be asking me this question.

1042
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,080
What you're doing, you're doing
but a lot of people do is you

1043
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,760
thinking about your business and
your thinking about content as a

1044
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,880
gateway drug to a transaction.

1045
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,400
It's number two.

1046
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,640
If you thought of yourself as
a media company first and then

1047
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,480
somebody who does that arbitrage
with airBnB, you'd be putting

1048
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,040
out content of the neighborhoods
and the area and the city.

1049
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,640
Got it?

1050
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:56,280
If you were positioned as a
information to Japan 

1051
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,240
and we have this service

1052
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,320
that lets you stay
in these apartments,

1053
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,600
your whole world 
would be different.

1054
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,400
If you had a guide of 10 best
places to eat sushi in Japan and

1055
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,760
that was your gateway
drug to the transaction,

1056
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,280
you'd think totally different.

1057
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:15,280
We have to separate marketing as
a gateway drug to a transaction

1058
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,080
and being a content company.

1059
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,560
So what I would do if I were
you is start doing the, you'd be

1060
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,160
blown away, I mean 
absolutely blown away 

1061
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,560
by the capabilities of targeting

1062
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,360
people on Facebook or Twitter
that are saying they're going to

1063
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,280
Japan, putting out an article
that says eight great places to

1064
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,680
eat sushi in Japan and then
using that as a gateway drug

1065
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,760
because at the end of that
article or on the left side of

1066
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,400
the article or however you
decide to UI and UX it,

1067
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,280
there's a transaction to
stay in your places.

1068
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,200
But that takes a totally

1069
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,760
different commitment,
bro, right?

1070
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,840
That takes you hiring an
editor-in-chief to be in charge

1071
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,760
of the content when you're like,
"What are you talking about?

1072
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,080
"I fucking rent out
fucking apartments, Gary.

1073
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:53,960
"You fucking maniac."

1074
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,040
(audience laughter)

1075
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,880
And so when I think about
the world the way I see it, you

1076
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,360
know, people see the
world differently.

1077
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,680
I see all of you needing an

1078
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,680
editor-in-chief or
you needing to be that.

1079
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,680
And I get why it sounds weird
for your business to have one.

1080
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,400
I don't give a shit,
I know I'm right.

1081
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,360
So that's the shift that I see.

1082
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,080
That's where I see you
having a real opportunity.

1083
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,240
I would look at those locations,
I would take a 10 mile radius of

1084
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,440
everything that's around it and
I would become the number one

1085
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,000
content producer in the world
of every museum, park, sushi,

1086
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,280
restaurant, fucking
theater, fuckin' everything.

1087
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,840
(audience laughter)

1088
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:36,520
You got it.
(audience applause)

1089
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,640
And by the way, the advice
I just gave you is hard,

1090
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:43,080
borderline expensive and you've
got to be patient as fuck to get

1091
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,120
any pay dirt out of
what I just told you.

1092
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,880
You'll hate me for 18 months and

1093
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,800
then you'll kiss my
fucking face in 24.

1094
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,240
(audience laughter)

1095
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,160
Got it?

1096
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,400
- [Glenn] I see my my man Scott
Lachtman here hurting his neck

1097
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,040
from nodding so hard 'cause

1098
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,440
that's what he did
in his area, man.

1099
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,080
I love it.

1100
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,120
- [Georgie] Hey Gary.
- [Gary] Hey, how are you?

1101
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,680
- [Georgie] My name's Georgie,
I've got a company called

1102
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,960
AfterTheRock.com.au and
I'm a wedding planner.

1103
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,640
- [Gary] Amazing.

1104
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,720
After The Rock, I like it.
- [Georgie] Thank you.

1105
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,840
.com.au for everyone else.

1106
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,920
(audience laughter)

1107
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,640
Link it up, DRock,
if you're here.

1108
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,480
(audience laughter)

1109
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,120
Gary, I'm launching an online
program teaching brides how to

1110
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,320
plan their wedding kind of

1111
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,360
Marie Forleo style
in about eight months.

1112
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,000
- [Gary] Smart.

1113
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
- [Georgie] And I want
to go hard on my--

1114
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,440
- [Gary] Can
I question real quick?

1115
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,440
- [Georgie] Yes.
- [Gary] Why eight months?

1116
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,600
- [Georgie] Because I'm
practitioner like I'm in the

1117
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,400
business with a hell of a lot of
weddings coming up and I really

1118
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,280
want to do a massive push
with my content and my marketing

1119
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,720
before I launch.
- [Gary] Got it.

1120
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,040
- [Georgie] And I want to
give a hell of a lot of value,

1121
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:38,800
and I've been testing it.

1122
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,280
It's ready to go, I'll be
testing it and changing

1123
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,600
it as I go. But I just want
to be launching hard.

1124
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,280
So I really want to know, I got
ideas of doing, well not ideas,

1125
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,440
I've got plans of on Snapchat
series and all sorts of things

1126
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,320
I just want to how you would
market it for 2016, 2017?

1127
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:56,720
- So the one disadvantage I have
is I haven't fully audited the

1128
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,400
Aussie market for that.

1129
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,440
We have some clients that do
work here that I've some reads

1130
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,600
on so I don't think people
realize Australia is one of

1131
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,800
three best markets for
Facebook in the world.

1132
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,880
From the thing that
I trade, attention, the depth of

1133
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,360
interaction per content
here is unbelievable.

1134
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,200
I think, before you fancy with
everything else, make sure you

1135
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:20,120
dominate Facebook because
the ability to target is so

1136
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,080
incredible in that environment.

1137
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,320
The first thing comes to mind
right away is what's going on,

1138
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,960
I don't know but the first thing
I would do if you like if I was

1139
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,040
like really working to the
first things I would do is audit

1140
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,600
Pinterest very aggressively
and understand what's happening

1141
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,760
there and understand
infographics and

1142
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,480
things that nature.

1143
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,520
But look, I think if you're at
a place where you know to say,

1144
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,040
"DRock, link it up," and you've
been watching my stuff,

1145
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,280
it's the whole theme
of this talk. Right?

1146
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,760
I mean if you think about a
bride, if we're gonna generalize

1147
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,560
that they're not you know on
their second marriage or maybe a

1148
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,400
woman that decided to get
married later,

1149
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,240
they're young women
for the most part.

1150
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,440
They only live here.

1151
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,080
They only live in the phone.

1152
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,120
They only live on those places.

1153
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,200
I would say Instagram is
probably an incredibly,

1154
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,440
that I know for fact,

1155
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,440
in this market so Instagram
is very, very important.

1156
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,840
I think they should probably
starting now for a 8 month from

1157
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:15,880
now launch, I would be searching
hashtags engaged, all those

1158
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,280
hashtags and I would start
building relationships right now

1159
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,360
with women that just got engaged
or engaged in last six months

1160
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:25,480
just got married because if they
could be ambassadors or things

1161
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:29,480
of that nature I truly think
the attention on Instagram from

1162
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:33,160
individuals is on believable.
Right?

1163
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:36,320
There's a lot of models in
Australia like I would even

1164
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,840
though they may not be engaged
or married I would look at them

1165
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,640
and try to figure out what
your narrative is with them.

1166
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,840
I think that's a great arbitrage

1167
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,560
but it comes down
to quality content.

1168
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,760
The fact that you're in the
trenches and actually do this

1169
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,440
for a living
already has me excited.

1170
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:55,200
If you scratch your own itch
on content, you win, right?

1171
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,160
If you actually have a business
that you're building content on

1172
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,000
top of, I'm very
fruitful on that.

1173
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,600
That's just gonna take patience,
time, effort and so that's what

1174
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,840
I would say.

1175
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,160
It's nothing crazy that
you haven't heard yet.

1176
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:12,160
I think what you need to do is
understand, you're not going to

1177
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,600
get as much out of it
as you think upfront and

1178
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,960
you just need to stick with it.

1179
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,680
Marie, you know, Red Cross shit
in 2009 it took her 3 years to

1180
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,560
get into a place where it
started becoming anything.

1181
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:26,360
Do you have the patience and
the tenacity to each shit for

1182
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,360
36 months is the game.
- [Georgie] Yeah.

1183
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,480
Awesome.
- [Gary] It's the game.

1184
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,480
- [Georgie] Thank you for
everything you do, too.

1185
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:31,960
- [Gary] You're welcome.

1186
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,560
- [Georgie] Thank you.
- [Gary] Thank you.

1187
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:38,400
(audience appluase)

1188
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,320
- [DeAnne] Hi Gary, ooh!
- You're good.

1189
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,680
- [DeAnne] Hi, Gary, I'm DeAnne.
I'm so excited that you're here.

1190
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,520
I love all the shit you do
and I'm one of the ones that's

1191
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,880
supposed to be retiring but
I'm not now because of

1192
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,960
what you're telling me.
- I love it.

1193
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,480
- [DeAnne] One of the questions
I have here, I know that you

1194
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,520
were when you did a podcast
recently with James Altucher you

1195
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,160
talked about the
true north of truth,

1196
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,360
the North Star of truth, rather.

1197
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:07,160
And you said that people are
putting more content out, being

1198
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,360
more and more honest the way
that you do it every day and

1199
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:14,400
then I look at the kids who are
coming up supposedly 80% who

1200
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,280
all they want to do is make
money and be famous and

1201
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,160
I'm thinking well, how do those
two things go together because

1202
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,680
all we're gonna have is these
kids who are oversharing to the

1203
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,040
point where it's almost
pornographic and

1204
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,360
frightened me at 53,

1205
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,080
to go well shit if I have
to go up against that

1206
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,880
I'm in real trouble.

1207
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,480
How do you put those
two things together?

1208
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,440
Where do you see
it going in time?

1209
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,600
Do we have to do what you do?

1210
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,440
- [Gary] Well no, I mean look,

1211
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,800
everybody has to do
what's like there's, no.

1212
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,080
If you're gonna map, hold on
to the mic 'cause I have some

1213
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,240
questions for you.

1214
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,280
And I think you might've saw
this in a DailyVee and you're

1215
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,200
gonna hear a lot of this out
of my mouth for the rest of the

1216
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,400
year, I've no interest in
anybody doing what I do.

1217
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,480
I have interest in communicating
what I do and then everybody

1218
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,680
here is a big girl and boy you
can like look at that be like

1219
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,960
alright, here's what I can do
that's this but I definitely

1220
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,000
don't want to that
and this and that.

1221
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,400
Are you asking me that because
so many people that are cut the

1222
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:09,280
younger generation that they're
putting up so much content that

1223
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,240
they're not going
to consume content?

1224
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:14,440
'Cause I think that's it
very popular point of view.

1225
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,200
- [DeAnne] Yes.

1226
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,800
It's not only that they consume
it but they seem to overshare

1227
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,400
about everything
that is out there and

1228
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,840
a lot of it is just shit.

1229
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,520
I'm not interested.

1230
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,240
- [Gary] No, no, no.
A lot of it may be shit to you.

1231
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:26,920
- [DeAnne] Yeah.

1232
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,480
- [Gary] The problem is
you don't get to decide.

1233
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,200
- [DeAnne] Yep, okay.

1234
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:32,160
- [Gary] Right, so like when the
Kardashians become big in the US

1235
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,720
and everybody says that's shit
television the problem is 

1236
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,000
it's the number one
television show on TV.

1237
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,080
Many people in here think
that footy or football or

1238
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,320
American football is shit and
that's a waste of four hours but

1239
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,080
it's my biggest escapism.

1240
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,400
I said this the other day,

1241
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,160
we are not allowed to judge
other people's escapism.

1242
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,360
Some people think it's shit to
stay in line for four hours and

1243
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,240
wait for Star Wars, other people
live for it every three years.

1244
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,480
You know,
some people think,

1245
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,800
I think it's shit to read
business books.

1246
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,480
(audience laughter)

1247
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,480
Let me just say
it one more time.

1248
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,960
Let me just say it one more
time, I think it's a waste of

1249
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,920
time to read business books.

1250
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:16,680
So, you don't get to judge if
like scantily clad girls are

1251
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,960
sharing everything
because you don't.

1252
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:20,920
The market is the market.

1253
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,760
Here's what I can tell you,

1254
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,680
there's a great thing
about the market.

1255
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,600
The bad thing is people get
sad when they hear that part.

1256
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,080
They don't understand though

1257
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:32,360
that the cream always
rises to the top.

1258
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,040
There's a lot of people
that have tried to do what the

1259
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,320
Kardashians have done.

1260
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,080
There's been a lot of sports.

1261
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,680
There's a lot of
pretty girls and boys.

1262
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,360
Eventually the market
makes its decisions.

1263
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,880
You may not be happy with what
the market picks 

1264
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,320
but it makes it's decisions.

1265
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,760
Instead of being crippled by
whatever, I don't even know what

1266
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,800
anybody else does. Bless you.

1267
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:56,400
Like, I don't have a fucking
clue what Tim Ferriss or

1268
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,600
Tony Robbins or Oprah or
Altucher. I don't even know.

1269
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,120
Don't even know and I would tell
you as much as you can take that

1270
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:07,560
approach you need to worry about
what you do and what you want to

1271
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:10,680
accomplish and what you want
people to get out of you and

1272
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,880
what you want. Right?
- [DeAnne] Yeah.

1273
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,080
- I have a friend who all he
wants to is make $100,000 year

1274
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,440
so we can go to Jamaica
and smoke weed, right?

1275
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,680
(audience laughter)

1276
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,560
And that's awesome, God bless.

1277
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,760
I mean I'd kill myself
if that was my ambition.

1278
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,560
Right, so you know, everybody
gets to do what they want but

1279
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,640
I think you're making a huge

1280
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:33,200
energy waste
on trying to decide.

1281
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,000
Do not judge the market.

1282
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,360
Reserve all that energy and
time to focus on your thing.

1283
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:42,240
You will put out stuff, your
community will come to you based

1284
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,840
on what you're putting out
and if nobody's coming,

1285
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,640
then you're not putting
out good shit, darling.

1286
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,360
- [DeAnne] Yeah, okay.
Thanks Gary.

1287
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,440
- [Gary] You got it.

1288
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,200
(audience applause)

1289
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,400
- [Glenn] Gary, about, I don't
know how long, maybe five years

1290
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,960
ago this guy was
my GaryVee then.

1291
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,280
He tried to talk me
into it and you know what?

1292
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,120
I did what you said,
I became a good 68 which has

1293
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,280
been financially
fricking awesome.

1294
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,640
- [Gary] That's right.
- [Gelnn] I'm not a LeBron.

1295
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,080
I'm a really good 68 and
I rock because of his advice.

1296
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:13,480
So this was my GaryVee
before I sort of played around,

1297
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,640
I cheated on him with
the guy on the stage.

1298
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,120
- [Gary] We can do a
threesome, don't worry.

1299
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,080
(audience laughter)

1300
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,880
- [Greg] Gary, it's GV.
- [Gary] How are you?

1301
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,480
- [Greg] Yeah, Greg Vincent.

1302
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,920
I just wanted to, I've been
watching you on your

1303
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,560
Wine Library and I saw your book
launch at 2 o'clock the other

1304
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:32,040
morning and it's
just amazing to see.

1305
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,200
- [Gary] Thank you.

1306
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,320
- [Greg] I just want to ask--
- [Gary] Yes.

1307
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:38,720
- [Greg] 'Cause real estate
agents are basically distrusted.

1308
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,440
- [Gary] Distrusted?

1309
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,440
- [Greg] Distrusted and
across the profession.

1310
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,800
What are some of the things
you'd recommend from a trust

1311
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,080
based marketing approach?

1312
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,440
- [Gary] I have a
really good idea on this.

1313
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,720
And this is something that I've
deployed to some friends in the

1314
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,840
U.S. in real estate that's
really worked for them.

1315
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:55,640
And it's a little bit and

1316
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,080
it's fun that you watched
Wine Library TV.

1317
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,760
It's a very controversial
thing to wrap your head around.

1318
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:06,160
So what you probably remember is
I panned the wines that I sold.

1319
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,960
It was my store,
we sold these wines.

1320
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:14,360
I would sit in front of a camera
and I would say this wine sucks.

1321
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,680
It's off balanced,
there's too much frite,

1322
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,040
you know, this and that.

1323
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,200
As a matter of fact, I don't
know how many of you know this,

1324
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,360
probably very few,
maybe one or two.

1325
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:27,880
In 1998, 1999 I was one of the
loudest voices in America about

1326
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:31,200
the whole Borossa
Valley explosion in the U.S.

1327
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,320
I was a huge advocate.

1328
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,640
I loved here.
I came here a bunch.

1329
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,680
I came here four
times in five years.

1330
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:40,840
But then, the Borossa
Valley wines got really too big.

1331
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,680
Way too fruity, 
way too alcoholic

1332
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,240
and I started 
going the other way.

1333
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,800
Didn't come here as often.

1334
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,600
(audience laughter)

1335
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,240
You guys weren't
super happy about that.

1336
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,920
But it was super weird.

1337
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,800
And by the way, these were
people that invited me into,

1338
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,880
I would sit on camera, at one
point the show got very big.

1339
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,880
Four, 500,000 people watching a
video where I'm tasting a bottle

1340
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,360
of wine and saying it's rubbish
when this is was somebody three

1341
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:12,160
years ago who let me
sleep in their guest room.

1342
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:16,000
Very tough shit.

1343
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,720
But I was always obsessed

1344
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,440
with being honest
with the other person.

1345
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:24,840
I don't think it's a great
way to get listings by making a

1346
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,760
video and telling everybody that
even though the inspector will

1347
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,000
say so I think you
need to replace the roof.

1348
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,920
I don't think the person selling
the home is going to be pumped

1349
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,480
with you after they
gave you the listing.

1350
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:39,440
However, that might
be an extreme version.

1351
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,240
But if you, instead of
saying this is an up-and-coming

1352
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,120
neighborhood if you're like
look, this neighborhood is seven

1353
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,120
years away from really popping.

1354
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,080
If you're cool with that, great.

1355
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,920
But too many of my friends
and I follow this space pretty

1356
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,120
carefully are saying
is the next Brooklyn.

1357
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:59,160
And they know in their
hearts that it's 10 years away.

1358
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,440
So why the fuck
are they saying it?

1359
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,800
Because they want the
transaction instead of

1360
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,200
building the brand.

1361
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,440
My friends, I didn't want to

1362
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,760
sell you more wine
on Wine Library TV.

1363
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,680
I wanted to become
the world's wine guy.

1364
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,720
And that allowed me to leave
that business day in and day out

1365
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:14,920
and it still does it's business

1366
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,760
while I went on
to do other things.

1367
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:19,720
Had I looked for the
transaction, I'd still be there.

1368
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,160
Do you understand?

1369
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,280
Do you get it?

1370
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,680
So GV, the way you do it

1371
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,400
is by telling the fucking truth.

1372
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,880
And it's really hard.

1373
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,920
When you represent her and now
you're making a fucking video on

1374
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,840
your phone saying the
fucking lawn is a piece of shit.

1375
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,160
(audience laughter)

1376
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:40,440
And so I don't, I can't tell
you what to do but I can tell

1377
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:43,120
you the further you 
get away from the truth

1378
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,440
the more likely you're
not going to win long-term.

1379
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,720
It's basic as fuck.

1380
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:47,920
You know it's true.

1381
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,640
You don't want to do it because
it hurts your short-term money.

1382
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,560
I get it.

1383
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:54,240
Do you but it doesn't change it.

1384
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,400
It doesn't change the
fact that that's right.

1385
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,440
It doesn't change it.
Do you understand?

1386
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,920
Just 'cause you want it to be
that way, it doesn't change it.

1387
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,760
You got it.
- [Greg] Thanks buddy.

1388
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:07,760


1389
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,280
(audience applause)

1390
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,080
- [Glenn] You need to be
prepared, young lady.

1391
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,800
- [Matt] Hey Gary,
how are you doing?

1392
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,040
- [Gary] I'm doing
well, my friend.

1393
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:20,840
- [Matt] My name is Matt.

1394
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,200
- [Gary] Matt.

1395
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,160
- [Matt] The other week you
put up a bartering thing on your

1396
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:28,160
book for I can offer you
something and I have to buy a

1397
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,920
certain amount of books
to make it come true.

1398
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,920
I offered to be your driver
whilst you're in Sydney and

1399
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,400
they kept saying no.
- [Gary] Yes.

1400
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,160
- [Matt] So, I'll take another
swing, I'm asking you now,

1401
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:35,960
what can I do for you?

1402
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,640
Buy books?
Sandy hand job?

1403
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,640
Whatever is going-- 
(audience laughter)

1404
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,840
to drive you back to
the airport tonight.

1405
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,080
- Let me, hold on let me see.

1406
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,400
I think they're
saying no for a reason.

1407
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,800
Let me see if it's still there.

1408
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,680
- [Glenn] Good hustle, man.

1409
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,040
- [Gary] The hand
job sounds amazing.

1410
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,120
- [Glenn] It's inappropriate
but good hustle.

1411
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,120
(audience laughter)

1412
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,920
- [Gary] Yeah, so this is
why my team is the best.

1413
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:02,040
The reason I don't, the reason
I can't is that I'm leaving at

1414
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:05,800
6:30 from my hotel and from
6:30 to 7:30 I'm dealing with a

1415
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,200
pretty important business
issue, that's a negative.

1416
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,760
They know that if it's
a negative, forget it.

1417
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,560
I'm trying to hold on to a
client that's not happy.

1418
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,680
I'm just not in the
right mindset to have that

1419
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,280
conversation, you
know what I mean?

1420
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:18,920
- [Matt] Yeah.

1421
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:24,080
- So, I apologize
but let me think.

1422
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,600
I'll talk to you before I leave.

1423
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,240
Cool. I appreciate the effort.

1424
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,560
- [Glenn] In a
quiet room somewhere.

1425
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:29,280
- You know what's funny?

1426
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:33,560
You know what's funny is that
it's amazing to me how much

1427
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:36,440
I obsess over tenacity.

1428
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,400
There's a real no that I should
be giving you and I'm fighting

1429
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,320
for you 'cause I just
love and by the way,

1430
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,120
it's really important to me.

1431
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:47,720
I am blown away, by the way,
the quickest reason that I know

1432
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:50,320
there's so many not real
entrepreneurs in the marketplace

1433
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:53,200
right now and I'm an investor in
a lot and watching people is a

1434
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,000
real entrepreneur
just never gives up.

1435
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,880
You're kind of like dead
before you before you give up.

1436
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:03,800
I really appreciate the tenacity
and I appreciate the tactic.

1437
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,320
It's not creepy or rude or
pulling up, it's just I mean it.

1438
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,120
"Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook,"
how many people read it

1439
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,840
or know the spiel, right?

1440
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:10,840


1441
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,320
A lot of people confused by
"Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook" and

1442
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,160
that's why I started
writing articles about it.

1443
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,280
A lot of people think it's, for
most of you that haven't read it

1444
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,280
it's over there, here's what it

1445
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:24,520
stands for give, give,
give and then ask.

1446
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:28,320
Not give, give, give
and then you're entitled.

1447
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:31,160
I given away 200 episodes of
#AskGaryVee and DailyVee and

1448
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,960
answered a million fucking 
emails and Snapchat this and 

1449
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:36,000
this and this, 
like all sorts of shit.

1450
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,880
And then, plenty of people
are not buying the book.

1451
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:42,040
I just read 100 tweets on the
way, long fucking flight here.

1452
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:46,440
You know, 100 tweets of like
literally people that are like,

1453
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,160
"Nah, I watched every episode of

1454
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,480
"#AskGaryVee so I'm not
going to buy the book.

1455
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,840
"I probably got all
the information."

1456
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:55,640
Literally, literally 20 minutes
shows times a buck-eighty

1457
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,480
and I couldn't get
them to a place

1458
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,800
where they wanted
to buy one $18 book.

1459
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,200
And I'm okay with that
'cause that's the market.

1460
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,840
Because the advice
I gave you, darling,

1461
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:07,800
is the same advice
I live every day.

1462
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,080
They don't want to.

1463
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,040
It's just the way it is.

1464
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,640
So give, give,
give and then ask.

1465
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,920
And it's just the ask, right?
That's all you get.

1466
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,840
My man?
- [Iman] Hi Gary.

1467
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,280
- [Gary] I'm well.
- [Iman] Hi Gary.

1468
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:21,760
My name is Iman from Singapore.

1469
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,480
I flew in from
Singapore to see you as well.

1470
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,560
- [Gary] Thank you.

1471
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,480
(audience applause)

1472
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:29,360
- I remember that in one of
your big videos on posted this

1473
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,880
recently, the breakout
video where you spoke at the

1474
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,320
conference in the U.S.

1475
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:38,080
and you talked about growing a
business with users and then

1476
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,600
flipping it is not
a business model.

1477
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,240
- [Gary] That's right.
- [Iman] Right.

1478
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,280
- [Gary] That's a
business model.

1479
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,880
It's business model
for like 11 people.

1480
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,640
Building a big business that
gets a million users on an app

1481
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:48,960
and then you raise more money

1482
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,320
and you're still
not making money.

1483
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,920
It was a business
model for Instagram.

1484
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,880
He made $1 billion.

1485
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,400
The problem is there's
four fucking Instagrams.

1486
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,600
And there's 80,000 apps that 

1487
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,520
were deployed to 
the app store today

1488
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,440
that have the model of 
I'm gonna get a million users

1489
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,880
I'm going to raise money and
then I'm going to exit.

1490
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,080
And so, in the context of
that conversation you just saw

1491
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:12,560
everybody is grounded, it is a
business model,

1492
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,000
I'm just not 
super intrigued by the

1493
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,399
.00001% business model.

1494
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:21,759
- [Iman] I absolutely agree
and I believe that that so many

1495
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,399
people in Singapore and
Asia need to see you.

1496
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:25,639
So my question is how many

1497
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,960
people are we going
to speak to in Asia?

1498
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:28,880
- [Gary] How many what?

1499
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:29,560
- [Iman] How many people in

1500
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,479
Singapore would you
like to speak to you?

1501
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:35,159
- [Gary] All of them.
How many would I like to?

1502
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:35,840
- [Iman] Yeah.

1503
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,040
- [Gary] You want me to
go to Singapore with you?

1504
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,080
Tonight?

1505
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,479
(audience laughter)

1506
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:41,959
You'll drive us, 
we'll get hand jobs, 

1507
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,680
we'll go to Singapore,
it'll be great.

1508
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:46,960
(audience laughter)

1509
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,920
- [Iman] But this is an
absolutely serious ask.

1510
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:52,080
- [Gary] So honestly, 
on a serious ask we,

1511
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,560
you're gonna love 
what I'm about to say.

1512
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:57,520
We open VaynerMedia
London next month.

1513
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:58,240
- [Iman] Yep.

1514
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:02,080
- [Gary] And I've already got
all the paperwork in place,

1515
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,880
we will be we are going to open
up VaynerMedia Singapore in the

1516
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,600
next 24 to 36 months so you'll
be seeing too much of me in Asia

1517
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,000
and in Singapore specifically.

1518
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,600
- [Iman] Thank you.
(audience applause)

1519
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:18,160
- [Glenn] Up the back, up the
back, up the back, at the back.

1520
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:21,399
You gotta stand
up, my beautiful?

1521
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:23,999
- [Woman 2] Hi Gary, thank you
so much for coming in today.

1522
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,120
So my question is well today

1523
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,200
you spoke a lot about
playing to your skill.

1524
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:28,880
- [Gary] Yes.

1525
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,600
- [Woman 2] And I'm just
wondering how did you find--

1526
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,680
- [Gary] And by the way, by the
way, not only skill, strength.

1527
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:34,200
Right?

1528
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,840
- [Woman 2] Strength, yeah.
- [Gary] How did I find it?

1529
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:36,840
- [Woman] Yeah,
how did you find it?

1530
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,920
Did it just click one day
or did you always know it?

1531
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,439
- [Gary] So for me it did
but I got different stories.

1532
01:09:42,439 --> 01:09:45,159
I'm wrong, I'm the
wrong kind of blueprint.

1533
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:48,120
I realized it in
third grade. Right?

1534
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:51,240
I basically gave up at school
when I was like 10 years old

1535
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,279
'cause I already knew.

1536
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:56,000
This is why I'm trying to
figure out self-awareness.

1537
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,360
Why did get so lucky that even
at 10 and 11, do you know how

1538
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:04,800
tough it is to be ridiculed and
be called stupid at 10 and

1539
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,240
11 years old when you
know you're special?

1540
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,480
It sucked.

1541
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,880
It was like, talking about
eating shit, I ate shit for

1542
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,400
basically most of my childhood.

1543
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:18,680
My friend's moms literally did
not want, my friends hanging out

1544
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:21,600
with me because I was an
F student but I was spending all

1545
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,520
my time honing my skill
that I knew I had and

1546
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,520
I was really working on it.

1547
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,320
I definitely feel better about
giving this advice than I do

1548
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:35,320
finding self-awareness,
I would take every inclination,

1549
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:40,120
every passion, every curiosity
and I would spend every minute

1550
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:44,960
even at 90 or nine years old
trying all the things that come

1551
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,280
to mind and trying them.

1552
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:54,200
Guys, if you have the audacity
to want to live a highly

1553
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:57,440
financial successful life,
if you have the audacity,

1554
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,120
if you're sitting here, I mean
this is a business conference.

1555
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,040
I don't think you're here
for fucking kicks and giggles.

1556
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:05,120
I don't think you're
here to hear music.

1557
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:09,280
If you have the audacity 
to be financially successful

1558
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,960
you need to understand a
couple of things.

1559
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:16,200
One, it's rare.
Like, it's rare.

1560
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,760
There's not that many
people that have it.

1561
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:22,400
Number two, you need
to give up on leisure.

1562
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,880
Like, if you want the good stuff

1563
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:28,680
you're not going to
able to golf every day.

1564
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:31,920
You're not going sailing
the whole fucking summer.

1565
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,680
I had my first kind of summer of
my life last year which meant

1566
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:39,440
we bought a house 
in the Hamptons

1567
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:43,200
and I went there
for the weekends.

1568
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,000
You've a lot of time.

1569
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,600
If you're willing, if you want
good stuff, if you want to be

1570
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,120
happy and rich,
you have 15 hours a day,

1571
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,920
minimumly 12 
where you can do shit.

1572
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,240
You can work your job and pay
your fucking bills for seven or

1573
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:59,360
eight and then you have
fucking six, seven other hours.

1574
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,400
I always say this in the U.S.,

1575
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,920
stop watching "House of Cards."

1576
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,040
Stop playing
fucking "Call of Duty."

1577
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,120
Stop going to every
fucking footy match.

1578
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,960
No more fucking happy hour.

1579
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,840
Go and fucking sing and then
paint and then try to copywrite

1580
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,960
and then fucking be a robot,
I don't fucking know but go.

1581
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,480
It's a very easy answer.

1582
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,480
It's very easy to
find your skill.

1583
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,720
Go try shit.

1584
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:23,880
(audience laughter)

1585
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,800
It's just that, I have an
entrepreneur right now whose

1586
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,880
business going to go out
of business in four months.

1587
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:29,880
He's burning cash.

1588
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,400
It runs out in four months.

1589
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,200
Nobody is giving him money for
his next round because funding

1590
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,480
is getting tough in the U.S.

1591
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:40,160
Fucking went skiing
the last two weekends.

1592
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,320
I don't know what the
fuck's the matter with people.

1593
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:42,320


1594
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,560
(audience laughter)

1595
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:48,360
And then I have people,
my friends complain.

1596
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,320
Do you know much how
I hate complaining?

1597
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,640
You will never hear me complain

1598
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,600
that I don't spend enough
time with my family.

1599
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:54,720
I made my bed.

1600
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:55,800
I'm sleeping in it.

1601
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,800
Don't go to Australia for

1602
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,840
11 hours if you want
to see your family.

1603
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,920
My buddy is like complaining.

1604
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,360
Guy's made hundreds of millions
of dollars and I'm having dinner

1605
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,480
with him the other night he's
like complaining the whole time

1606
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:08,960
about not seeing his family.

1607
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,560
I'm like, "Fuck you.

1608
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,440
"Just go spend time
with your family.

1609
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,200
"I have no empathy
for your bullshit."

1610
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,240
In the same way I don't have
empathy for my friends who are

1611
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,600
like, "Oh Gary,
you're so lucky."

1612
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:19,720
I'm not fucking lucky.

1613
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,760
I fucking worked.

1614
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,800
Fucking worked my ass off.
I'm lucky?

1615
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,200
You fucking get home every night
at five o'clock and do dick.

1616
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,920
(audience laughter)

1617
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,160
You're lucky.

1618
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:33,240
(audience laughter and applause)

1619
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:39,440
I secretly took this
conference, for one,

1620
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:42,720
I loved your tenacity but
secretly took it because

1621
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:45,520
it's kind of a vacation to
be in a plane for 19 hours.

1622
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,800
To answer your question, 

1623
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,920
it's actually 
stunningly practical

1624
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,480
and easy to find a skill
that can work for you.

1625
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:58,400
It's having a process that
allows you to cut out everything

1626
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:02,080
but trying things for three
months, six months, two days,

1627
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,640
four weeks, just try shit.

1628
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,760
You know?
It's really just trying shit.

1629
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:09,200
Look, I'm a really
good public speaker.

1630
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,600
I was 34 for the first
time I took the stage.

1631
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,280
I didn't know.
You know?

1632
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:18,120
It just happened.
So that's what I would do.

1633
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,360
- [Glenn] Last one.

1634
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:24,560
You're gonna have to
put the rest #AskGaryVee.

1635
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,880
We got one more then we got

1636
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:27,680
to do some stuff
at the back, yeah?

1637
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:27,680


1638
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:28,960
- Yes.

1639
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:29,960
- [Glenn] Here's Paul but guys

1640
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:32,520
if you've got one unanswered,
#AskGaryVee.

1641
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,120
There you go, man, you got
your next little bit of content.

1642
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,920
Paul.
- [Paul] Good day, mate.

1643
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:38,840
Hello?
- Yo.

1644
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,480
- [Paul] I'm on.

1645
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,960
You've mentioned some awesome
stats and they're obviously, 

1646
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,560
you live and breathe this stuff
and you do your research.

1647
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,240
I don't know where
you do your research so

1648
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:50,400
like the 53% of the public.

1649
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,760
Where do you do your research
and keep your finger on the

1650
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,320
pulse of where technology and

1651
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,840
everything is going
in the next few years?

1652
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,640
- [Gary] For me, I post-game.

1653
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:00,640
I've been talking about the
phone and all this and then

1654
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,920
people oftentimes will email me.

1655
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:06,680
Like, "Did you see," and by
the way that 53% comes from

1656
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:09,800
Forrester which is one of the
leading analytics places in the

1657
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:13,240
world but I don't
know what they did.

1658
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:14,440
I don't know if they surveyed

1659
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,080
100 people and
then said these 53.

1660
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:21,040
The truth is a lot of the stats,
I don't even care about them.

1661
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,280
I know what's true.

1662
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:26,360
I know that I'm selling more
stuff on Facebook ads that are

1663
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,680
mobile than desktop for
Wine Library right now

1664
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:31,160
that are my stats. Right?

1665
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,960
I don't really care 
about analytics and

1666
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,400
stats as much asmost people.

1667
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,800
I know they work for people.

1668
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,600
I know it's really
powerful when you hear it.

1669
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,400
Again, I thought the most fun
for me today was when I went

1670
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,720
through that
social media thing. Right?

1671
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,000
Where I was like social media,

1672
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,520
it's the slang term
for the internet itself,

1673
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,000
the current state
of the internet.

1674
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,760
Here's the phone. 53%.

1675
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,120
I started seeing faces going,

1676
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:58,040
"Fuck man, maybe I shouldn't,
shit maybe this is real." Right?

1677
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:01,920
It's good for stuff like that
but, very honestly, I think it's

1678
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,080
much more important to be

1679
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:06,000
a practitioner and
live and breathe it.

1680
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,840
I use it as post-game.

1681
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:11,560
There is no stat that
ever made me do something.

1682
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,280
And I think that, that's what

1683
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,320
I would like everyone in
this room to understand.

1684
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,440
Why are you not
willing to use common sense?

1685
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:22,640
Why were you not willing three
years ago when your buddy Hank

1686
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:27,440
who's 68 and works in the steel
mill, text you an emoji do you

1687
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,960
not realize shit's changing?

1688
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:32,520
You know, I would argue and

1689
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,000
I would implore
you to understand,

1690
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,440
you're living your life one way,
shit's happening and then for

1691
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:40,200
some reason when you
put on your work clothes,

1692
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:43,360
you think something
different's happening.

1693
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:46,160
Let me save you time 'cause
this is a good way to end.

1694
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,040
The reason you think something
else is happening when you put

1695
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:52,280
your work clothes on is 'cause
you don't want to do the work

1696
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:55,320
to adjust the reality
of the new market.

1697
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,840
You just don't.

1698
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:59,680
It's the truth.
And I get it.

1699
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:00,720
Do you know how exhausting it is

1700
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,400
for me to be right
after right after right?

1701
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,520
(audience laughter)

1702
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,120
No, no, no, no,
it's a funny joke.

1703
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:06,920
I mean it.

1704
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,120
At this point, I've got a
narrative of being right for a

1705
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:12,240
pretty long time and to sit here
in front of you today and know

1706
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:15,920
that if I'm not 
right in 24 months

1707
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,640
 that it's over.

1708
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,680
I don't get to sit at
the place where I sit.

1709
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:23,040
You're only as good
as your last at-bat.

1710
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,240
The market's constantly going
to change and so the copywriters

1711
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:29,240
that when the best at magazine
that didn't believe in the

1712
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,880
internet because they were
making money doing copywriting

1713
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,800
in the back of a magazine,
well they fucking lost.

1714
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:38,520
Do you understand?
They lost.

1715
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,080
One great thing for all of
you to read and I don't know if

1716
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:43,000
anybody's written the book on
it because I don't read those

1717
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,440
things but you can Google
this, go educate yourself what

1718
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:49,960
happened when the radio lost

1719
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,000
it's number one
spot to the television.

1720
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,200
It's the only thing you fully
understand philosophically to

1721
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,440
understand what's about to
happen over the next 10 years.

1722
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:01,800
If you understand that, you will
be more mentally prepared for

1723
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,840
what you're about to deal with
and please and I'll leave you

1724
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:07,240
with this 'cause
I know I'm leaving now.

1725
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:08,720
Everything that's happened
in the last 10 years,

1726
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:12,800
mobile devices, Facebook,
YouTube, all this shit,

1727
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:17,080
it's gonna seem boring and
slow compared to what our

1728
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,880
next 10 years are going to be.

1729
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,440
It is.
It's exponential.

1730
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,240
Caleb's generation doesn't
even know about anything else.

1731
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,120
In 10 years, Caleb's 24.

1732
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:30,600
He may rent an airBnB and
he's not gonna know anything.

1733
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,520
He's not gonna know
what a banner and is.

1734
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:33,600
Do you know what I mean?

1735
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,800
He's not going to know.

1736
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,200
They don't have email.

1737
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,280
They're not going to
know any different.

1738
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,760
It happens fast.

1739
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:46,640
Don't disrespect it because
it will run your ass over.

1740
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:52,320
All of you, including me, is
disrespecting it right now 

1741
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,800
and some of you in this room
are really fucking lost and

1742
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,520
disrespecting it a lot.

1743
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:59,800
And here's your business
strategy (loud inhale).

1744
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:03,040
(audience laughter)

1745
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,520
You're hoping
hoping it doesn't happen.

1746
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:07,600
You're sitting and saying
maybe if it just takes 15 years,

1747
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,600
I'll be out and on the beach.

1748
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:14,080
The market will put you on
the beach real fucking fast.

1749
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,800
(audience laughter)

1750
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:18,840
- [Gary] Thank you.
(audience applause)

1751
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,160
Thank you.

1752
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,320
(applause)

1753
01:19:21,320 --> 00:00:00,000
(rock music)
