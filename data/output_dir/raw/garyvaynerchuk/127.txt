1
00:00:00,761 --> 00:00:01,698
- [Man] If you were to
start all over again

2
00:00:01,698 --> 00:00:02,552
- Yep.

3
00:00:02,552 --> 00:00:03,493
- [Man] From scratch.

4
00:00:03,493 --> 00:00:04,326
- Yes.

5
00:00:04,326 --> 00:00:05,159
- [Man] No budget.

6
00:00:05,159 --> 00:00:05,992
- Yes.

7
00:00:05,992 --> 00:00:07,511
- [Man] And you wanted
to start a tech company,

8
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:08,344
what would you do?

9
00:00:08,344 --> 00:00:10,364
- I'd go work for somebody that I admire

10
00:00:10,364 --> 00:00:12,364
for free for four years.

11
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:15,773
- [Man] Can you name someone you admire?

12
00:00:15,773 --> 00:00:18,626
(audience laughs)

13
00:00:18,626 --> 00:00:20,129
- I would try to get to Jeff Bezos

14
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:22,231
and work for him for free.

15
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,328
- [Man] For free?

16
00:00:23,328 --> 00:00:24,941
- For free.

17
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,328
For four years.

18
00:00:26,328 --> 00:00:29,451
I would literally sleep on
the couch of an acquaintance

19
00:00:29,451 --> 00:00:32,237
and eat fast-food for 99 cents a day

20
00:00:32,237 --> 00:00:34,059
for four years to work for Jeff Bezos.

21
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:35,912
Fuck, I might be willing
to do that right now.

22
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:37,124
(audience laughs)

23
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:39,472
(audience claps)

24
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:42,139
(hip-hop music)

25
00:00:45,798 --> 00:00:49,527
I believe in 20 years
it will be common place

26
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:52,991
for individuals to pay
the best business leaders

27
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:56,927
to work for them, not
the other way around.

28
00:00:56,927 --> 00:00:58,835
It's a very weird thing that's starting

29
00:00:58,835 --> 00:01:00,844
to manifest in my head because it's

30
00:01:00,844 --> 00:01:04,099
just black and white to me
that that's where the value is.

31
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,678
Get as close to the sun of
the thing that you wanna be,

32
00:01:07,678 --> 00:01:09,786
and you will win if you're capable.

33
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:12,528
And you hear, now that I've
gotten curious about it,

34
00:01:12,528 --> 00:01:15,456
you start watching these documentaries

35
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:17,058
or you dig into the successful people.

36
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:20,674
The amount of people that
started off as grabbing coffee

37
00:01:20,674 --> 00:01:23,536
for the guy or the gal
that they wanted to be

38
00:01:23,536 --> 00:01:25,926
and then became it.

39
00:01:25,926 --> 00:01:27,843
I would do that my man.

40
00:01:28,754 --> 00:01:33,150
I would or, or, the thing
is it's back to guessing.

41
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,759
It's funny, the Bezos
thing or somebody else.

42
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:37,784
The other thing I would do try

43
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:40,310
to get very close to the voice space

44
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,376
but it's funny how I don't wanna go there

45
00:01:42,376 --> 00:01:45,472
because I wouldn't know which
founder was the good one

46
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,547
to build on top of the voice space.

47
00:01:47,547 --> 00:01:50,004
So I went to the platform or
something that I established.

48
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:54,070
But I genuinely believe
that when you're young,

49
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,257
time is your biggest leverage.

50
00:01:57,257 --> 00:01:59,814
And that what you should
do is build leverage

51
00:01:59,814 --> 00:02:02,835
with the leaders of the world.

52
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:05,773
If you wanna be a hip-hop
mogul, go work for Puff Daddy

53
00:02:05,773 --> 00:02:08,440
for free for three years, right?

54
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:14,646
We're so pressured by our
parents to start making money

55
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:15,963
at 22, 23.

56
00:02:15,963 --> 00:02:18,801
I think everybody should
legitimately have totally different

57
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:20,833
strategy from 22 to 30.

58
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:24,178
For everybody here over 45,
you know how young 30 is.

59
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:26,094
(audience laughs)

60
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:29,298
And I think everybody here
who's 45, 50, if I said:

61
00:02:29,298 --> 00:02:31,965
Hey what about spending 22 to 30

62
00:02:33,402 --> 00:02:34,745
and only working for the person

63
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:38,175
you admired the most for free?

64
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:39,936
I think a lot more people
would have taken that

65
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:41,731
up on than what they actually did.

66
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:44,227
Which is do bullshit to pay for their rent

67
00:02:44,227 --> 00:02:45,504
and like just dumb shit.

68
00:02:45,504 --> 00:02:47,154
Very intriguing to me that that's

69
00:02:47,154 --> 00:02:50,046
where the leverage is gonna go.

70
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:52,297
If you wanna be a great creative,

71
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,291
whoever the 10 best creative
directors in the world

72
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,124
now have the leverage.

73
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:59,398
So that's what I would do.

74
00:02:59,398 --> 00:03:00,231
Thank you guys.

75
00:03:00,231 --> 00:03:02,566
(audience claps)

76
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:03,399
Thank you.

77
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:11,573
- Patience

78
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:13,591
- It is the imperative
foundation of anything

79
00:03:13,591 --> 00:03:15,001
that is long-term successful.

80
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:15,948
- Why?

81
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:19,644
- Because when you are impatient
person or organization,

82
00:03:19,644 --> 00:03:22,207
you tend to make short-term
decisions which have been

83
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:24,932
proven historically as
something that creates

84
00:03:24,932 --> 00:03:28,432
a vulnerable usually to long-term growth.

85
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:47,551
What's up vlog?

86
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:49,169
Just going to the airport now in Oslo

87
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:52,357
on our way to Copenhagen, then to Moscow.

88
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,416
Back in the USSR as they say.

89
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:58,335
Anyway, good talk this
morning at breakfast.

90
00:03:58,335 --> 00:04:01,715
Just had a huge meeting with
Eric in the back of the cab.

91
00:04:01,715 --> 00:04:04,181
So many people wasting
time, I just basically

92
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:06,951
had a London office
meeting on the way here.

93
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:08,451
That's how ya hack it.

94
00:04:08,451 --> 00:04:11,842
Sometimes having somebody
travel, the expense is worth it

95
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:14,288
because the ROI of the
meeting and the serendipity

96
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:17,647
things like a cab ride
make a ROI positive.

97
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:21,248
Continue to hack your
time for your dollars.

98
00:04:21,248 --> 00:04:23,694
- We're good, just checking the lighting.

99
00:04:23,694 --> 00:04:26,194
(Gary laughs)

100
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,525
- I tweeted the other
day 0% of zero is zero.

101
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:43,981
A lot of people laughed and made jokes

102
00:04:43,981 --> 00:04:47,649
but it's funny somebody
was negotiating against me

103
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:48,817
in some business world where

104
00:04:48,817 --> 00:04:51,275
they were gonna take zero commission.

105
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:54,806
And on this thing, I don't
wanna be too specific.

106
00:04:54,806 --> 00:04:57,059
Anyway, which I replied to the

107
00:04:57,059 --> 00:04:59,040
person they were pitching it to.

108
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,232
I'm like cool, when they bring you nothing

109
00:05:02,232 --> 00:05:04,684
it's not gonna matter. (laughs)

110
00:05:04,684 --> 00:05:08,955
0% of zero is zero is
zero for that company,

111
00:05:08,955 --> 00:05:12,538
that person so, you can pass on my 20%

112
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:17,872
but when I bring 400,000, you'd get 320.

113
00:05:19,157 --> 00:05:23,330
When that person brings you
zero, you're gonna get zero.

114
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,702
Always wonder why somebody

115
00:05:24,702 --> 00:05:27,169
is willing to work on zero commission.

116
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:29,735
It's either because they're unbelievable

117
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:32,688
and they're making
money in some other spot

118
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:35,105
in that overall relationship,

119
00:05:36,097 --> 00:05:40,014
or it's cause they can't
deliver in that craft.

120
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:45,368
This situation was the
second one. (man laughs)

121
00:05:45,368 --> 00:05:49,285
That entity is not going
to bring you anything.

122
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:52,133
- [Man] People love you man.

123
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:54,383
- 'Cause I love them first.

124
00:05:56,301 --> 00:05:58,923
- (gasps) I waited three hours.

125
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:02,470
I have to go in 100
seconds, I want to just.

126
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,521
- You got it.

127
00:06:03,521 --> 00:06:04,748
- Because I love you.

128
00:06:04,748 --> 00:06:05,812
Thanks everything man.

129
00:06:05,812 --> 00:06:07,281
- You're welcome man.

130
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:09,453
I think people should sleep
six, seven, eight hours

131
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,153
depending on your body.

132
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:13,606
I'm a huge advocate in
what the fuck are you doing

133
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,643
the other 18 hours, right?

134
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:16,953
And so when I hear your question

135
00:06:16,953 --> 00:06:18,596
the answer is of course you should.

136
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:20,240
You know you should.

137
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,510
You you know you should
test, everybody here should

138
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,190
spend meaningful amounts
of time testing everything.

139
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,741
Everything!

140
00:06:28,741 --> 00:06:30,915
That's what your suppose to be doing

141
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:34,338
'cause you don't know the
answer for your specific nuance

142
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:38,501
if Linkedin or a podcast
or influencer marketing

143
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:41,015
or you know, you don't
know if that's gonna be the

144
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:42,691
turning point and what you're

145
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:45,105
doing is your doing too many things.

146
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,904
People are keeping their time precious

147
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:49,621
when it's their biggest asset.

148
00:06:49,621 --> 00:06:51,876
People are not reinvesting
money back into their business

149
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:54,023
'cause they wanna buy dumb shit.

150
00:06:54,023 --> 00:06:56,531
People are not trying
things because if they fail,

151
00:06:56,531 --> 00:06:59,939
they worry about what other
people think about that failure.

152
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:04,911
And so we're all, you know the
answer is yes, to everything.

153
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:06,610
Literally fuck it, I'm like yes.

154
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,511
And I could leave and go
fucking fly to LA right now

155
00:07:10,511 --> 00:07:12,948
because the next three hours is yes.

156
00:07:12,948 --> 00:07:14,314
(audience laughs)

157
00:07:14,314 --> 00:07:18,026
It is, yes so of course you should.

158
00:07:18,026 --> 00:07:20,907
Like, what are you doing
for 18 hours a day?

159
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,801
Find a hour and do it for a hour everyday

160
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:26,263
to get to the answer
and then also understand

161
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:29,308
that the first 10 times you
do it, it might not be right.

162
00:07:29,308 --> 00:07:31,770
Because it's like, I
always talk about the ROI.

163
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,174
People are like, what's
the ROI of influencers?

164
00:07:33,174 --> 00:07:34,007
Or VR?

165
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:37,343
Or the ROI of those 10 hours
reaching out to influencers?

166
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:41,702
The ROI of a basketball is
very different to people.

167
00:07:41,702 --> 00:07:45,076
To me it's nothing, to Lebron
James it's a billion dollars.

168
00:07:45,076 --> 00:07:47,159
So, all this stuff works.

169
00:07:48,074 --> 00:07:50,200
It's are you good at it?

170
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,227
Is a whole nother question.

171
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:54,962
So it's not just the ROI of trying it,

172
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:56,606
then you gotta get good at it.

173
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:58,015
Nothing you're good at right now,

174
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:01,141
you were so great at the
first time you tired it.

175
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:05,250
So, of course man, like
everything that's happening,

176
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,643
you need to figure out how
it works for your business.

177
00:08:07,643 --> 00:08:10,362
B to B, B to C, personal brand.

178
00:08:10,362 --> 00:08:13,336
The question is, what are
you doing with your time?

179
00:08:13,336 --> 00:08:17,175
You know, and so that's
why I get mad at people

180
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:18,519
who want to be an entrepreneur

181
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:22,031
and watch four hours of
Netflix a weekend or.

182
00:08:22,031 --> 00:08:24,259
And by the way people need escapism.

183
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:25,746
You need to check out, you need to rest.

184
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:27,807
You have to be in a mental
place but the scrutiny

185
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,720
that we have to put on our
time as young entrepreneurs,

186
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,975
you know it's just time or money.

187
00:08:33,975 --> 00:08:35,871
Talent is the variable that sits in here.

188
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:37,878
But the assets that you're sitting with,

189
00:08:37,878 --> 00:08:41,518
in the beginning your time
and then you amass money.

190
00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:43,506
And then you can use
the money to save time

191
00:08:43,506 --> 00:08:45,182
and you're just going back and forth.

192
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:47,445
And everybody wants these big dreams

193
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:50,114
and they're not willing to
work at the level they need to

194
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:52,198
when that's the advantage they have.

195
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,410
So, fuck yes you should.

196
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,389
Yeah, I'm really looking forward

197
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:59,885
to the flight to Moscow and
more importantly Moscow to LA.

198
00:08:59,885 --> 00:09:00,968
- What are we doing in Moscow
- That's crazy.

199
00:09:00,968 --> 00:09:02,988
- We're in the airport for eight hours.

200
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:06,033
I assume we have lounge
and we're just gonna

201
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:09,204
fall asleep in the corner on
a chair that looks like this.

202
00:09:09,204 --> 00:09:11,009
That's what we're gonna do. (laughs)

203
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,326
I mean honestly I'm very excited.

204
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:14,883
I've never been to the USSR.

205
00:09:14,883 --> 00:09:17,296
- Aw that's crazy
- Since I've left in 1970.

206
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:18,378
So it's actually a fun day but

207
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:19,211
I can't leave
- You can't leave.

208
00:09:19,211 --> 00:09:20,477
Well, you can't leave right because

209
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,985
you need a Visa.
- You need a Visa.

210
00:09:21,985 --> 00:09:23,653
And I didn't know I
was, I didn't even know

211
00:09:23,653 --> 00:09:25,921
until two days ago that we
were connecting through Moscow.

212
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:27,152
- [Man] That would have been nice though.

213
00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:29,512
- Just to run to Red
Square and do a meetup

214
00:09:29,512 --> 00:09:31,512
would have been awesome.

215
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:36,429
It's inspired me to wanna go back.

216
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:39,441
I don't know what we're
gonna do but yeah I'm tired.

217
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:41,813
- Alright can we get the last ones seated.

218
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:44,313
We only have 10 minutes till Gary leaves.

219
00:09:44,313 --> 00:09:46,570
- I felt pretty good about that.

220
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,890
I'm really excited to see
everybody here in Copenhagen.

221
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,504
Incredible, incredible
city, really good day.

222
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:53,391
- [Man] Yeah, great day.

223
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:55,187
- Got some good content.
- We have a lot to go yet.

224
00:09:55,187 --> 00:09:56,970
- It was a lot, yes we still. (laughs)

225
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,360
We have to go to the airport.

226
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,794
We gotta go, three, four
hour flight to Moscow,

227
00:10:00,794 --> 00:10:03,046
eight hour layover in Moscow.
- You have a drinks meeting.

228
00:10:03,046 --> 00:10:04,105
- I have a drinks meeting?

229
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:05,188
- [Man] That's where you gotta go next.

230
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,105
- Fuck.

231
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,921
I'm a much bigger brand than VaynerMedia.

232
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:08,754
- Yeah.

233
00:10:08,754 --> 00:10:09,721
- Yet I service no clients.

234
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:10,554
- Okay.

235
00:10:10,554 --> 00:10:13,633
- And it was because I knew
that that was the trap hole.

236
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:16,490
And you know again, remember I
said I fucked up with Google?

237
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,323
- Yeah, yeah.

238
00:10:17,323 --> 00:10:19,595
- When you do it, you know,
you did the right thing.

239
00:10:19,595 --> 00:10:22,089
But now the right thing
in this mature state

240
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,595
when you recognize it,
is the power of know.

241
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,396
Because if we're here three
years later and you're like

242
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:27,637
Gary, remember?

243
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:28,946
I'm like yeah, the guy
with the two earrings.

244
00:10:28,946 --> 00:10:29,779
Now there's no excuse.

245
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:33,455
Now that you know, now it's
just down to execution.

246
00:10:33,455 --> 00:10:34,288
(man asks question)

247
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:36,214
Yeah, I mean there's a
couple ways to go about it.

248
00:10:36,214 --> 00:10:37,047
You're like, I'm sorry.

249
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:37,880
You can't have me.

250
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,713
I've built it up.

251
00:10:38,713 --> 00:10:40,145
I've built my team.

252
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:43,128
Or you can go a different route.

253
00:10:43,128 --> 00:10:46,944
Oh, okay Rick, Sarah,
Hans-Shmanz, like you want me?

254
00:10:46,944 --> 00:10:49,718
Well, what we told you 5000 a month

255
00:10:49,718 --> 00:10:52,287
is actually 30,000 a month if you want me.

256
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,307
There's a lot of moves that you can have.

257
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:56,293
There's always gonna be an excuse.

258
00:10:56,293 --> 00:10:57,911
You're 100% in charge.

259
00:10:57,911 --> 00:11:01,369
You know what the issue is,
either address it or don't.

260
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,429
There's one of two ways.

261
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,729
You do what I, I've scaled
that and I've done it

262
00:11:06,729 --> 00:11:09,239
by hiring around two things.

263
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:12,282
One, everything I don't wanna do.

264
00:11:12,282 --> 00:11:15,494
Two, everything I know I'm not as good at

265
00:11:15,494 --> 00:11:17,804
than the other things
that I spend my time on.

266
00:11:17,804 --> 00:11:21,626
Which means I spend 30% of my time on HR.

267
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:23,493
Like you look at my
calendar, I'm just meeting

268
00:11:23,493 --> 00:11:26,732
with my employees talking
about somebody else

269
00:11:26,732 --> 00:11:28,399
that they're mad at.

270
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:31,764
But that's what I do so special

271
00:11:31,764 --> 00:11:33,591
that allows me to build
what I build, right?

272
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:36,503
So, it's about leaving money on the table

273
00:11:36,503 --> 00:11:38,761
in the short term, my friend.

274
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:42,113
You're trying to maximize the profit

275
00:11:42,113 --> 00:11:44,318
instead of reinvesting it into people

276
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:47,565
and having people do B versus your A.

277
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:49,675
It's about building a
business in five years

278
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:50,745
instead of one year.

279
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:55,359
Similar to him, nobody wants
to give up the short term.

280
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:59,037
He says yes for another 50,000
or 25,000 or 2000 a month

281
00:11:59,037 --> 00:12:02,152
or whatever it is, instead of saying no.

282
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:04,748
And then, you know, 'cause
it's exciting to take.

283
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:08,253
People get caught up in
top-line revenue or profit.

284
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:11,136
And it's always about
tweaking those two things.

285
00:12:11,136 --> 00:12:14,025
Also ego hurts these stories a lot.

286
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,467
You like the feeling of
being the best of the best.

287
00:12:17,467 --> 00:00:00,000
I listen to every word, you know?
