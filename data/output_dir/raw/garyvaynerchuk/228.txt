280
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,680

The world hadn't accepted its upside
但是在线购物还没有被大众所接受

284
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,120
I bet on consumer behavior

285
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,320
and innovation

286
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,880
and things changing

so I didn't predict the future

288
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,040
Were there five?

290
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,140
Were there are 5 liquor stores in America

291

So it feels like I'm predicting the future

294
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,400
but I'm taking innovation that's happening around me

295
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,820
and I'm deploying it against my own reality at that time

My bet was that we would pick convenience over history

Because that's what humans always do

and that's why it was so obvious

It'd be the same reason that I know that AI is going to be very important
我觉得人工智能很有前景也是这个原因

300
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,960
It's the same reason that I know voice is very important.
语音服务行业也是一样

301
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,440
