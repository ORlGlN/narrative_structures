1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,930
- [Jason] How's CES going for you?

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,510
- It's going super well.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,400
This is the only public thing I'm doing,

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,100
I've literally been in
hotel rooms having meetings

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,630
trying to make some fuckin
money the whole time so.

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,000
Just meeting with clients mainly,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,312
a couple of emerging platforms,

8
00:00:17,312 --> 00:00:20,010
but very focused on, you
know what's interesting

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,290
CES, South by, Cannes, these big events

10
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,710
I never go to the stage, I
don't consume the content.

11
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,860
I'm even speaking less, I just am using

12
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,900
a ton of the opportunity
to have the meetings

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,280
that I need to have over the next 120 days

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,220
in one place.

15
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,880
So basically, I come
to Vegas for three days

16
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,160
to save five or six days of travel

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,480
in the net score, so just
trying to be efficient.

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,300
- I think everybody's curious what

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,930
somebody like you who
is touching all points,

20
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,440
who makes a mission out
of connecting with people

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,950
and making sure that you know what's hot,

22
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,950
what's new, what people
are thinking about.

23
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,720
What kind of conversations
are you having here,

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,450
what are you seeing, or
who are you meeting with

25
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,283
that you're really excited about

26
00:01:05,283 --> 00:01:06,510
what kind of technologies are you seeing

27
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,010
that you're really excited about.

28
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,970
- I think what's very unique about CES

29
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,760
is that people get very
excited about what's coming

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,180
so I'm always a big fan of,

31
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,240
I know some of you here follow my content,

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,740
I'm very big on day trading attention.

33
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,550
What that really means is
I like being practical.

34
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,210
I don't like when people
think I'm a futurist

35
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,200
or a disruptor.

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,220
I don't think I am.

37
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,890
I actually think all I am
is just very practical.

38
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,610
I try to pay attention
to what you're paying

39
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,960
attention to at scale right now,

40
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,810
and how do I bring you
value in those environments.

41
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,590
So the thing that's interesting to me here

42
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,140
is everyone's talking
about, you know, voice

43
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,370
and IoT and connected
this, connected that.

44
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,470
Which is absolutely gonna to happen,

45
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,240
I'm super excited about it.

46
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,800
I can't wait to never
leave my fuckin room,

47
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,700
like it's all going to be great.

48
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,580
But for me I think it clouds a lot,

49
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,750
I would say the far
majority of companies here

50
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,670
will go out of business before the promise

51
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,400
of what they're trying to deliver on

52
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,560
becomes consumer at scale.

53
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,000
And so for me, I'm excited but tempered

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
in trying to help people stay
alive for the holy grail.

55
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:22,540
There's a lot of people in 2007

56
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,250
that thought social media
was going to be big.

57
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,500
The difference between
me and a lot of them

58
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,500
was I knew how to stay
alive, from 2007 to 2013

59
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,540
before it became really real.

60
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,410
And, you know, for me that's what CES

61
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,340
always reminds me, which is great,

62
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,720
I can't wait to have my robot wipe my ass,

63
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,170
but before that happens make sure

64
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,680
that you're still in business in 2027.

65
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,640
And so there's a little bit too much 2027

66
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,590
talk for me, but at the flip side

67
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,290
I love that people are inspired,

68
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,090
excited, meeting new
people, bouncing ideas,

69
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,860
thinking about things differently

70
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,270
and I would argue, for everybody
I'm looking at right now,

71
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,980
if you see something that allows you

72
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,900
to then use that as a
proxy to be practical

73
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,500
over the next 24 months,
that to me is interesting

74
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,010
in the way I think about CES.

75
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,190
- Yeah, so where you were going

76
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,180
there was where I wanted to pick up

77
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,920
because you have an easy situation

78
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,860
in that everybody wants
to come and talk to you.

79
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,760
That is not the case for most people here

80
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,210
who are trying to grab attention,

81
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,480
who are trying to find
connections, it's a lot harder.

82
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,570
What is your advice to
folks who have to go

83
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,810
out there and pursue
instead of being pursued?

84
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,050
- I'm a big fan of giving advice

85
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,100
I've actually taken myself,

86
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,760
like I'm a big fan of
eating my own dog food.

87
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,270
I used to come to events like this

88
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,580
and nobody knew who the hell I was,

89
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,030
that I was in the wine business

90
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,460
and it made no sense for me to be here.

91
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,280
I'm an extrovert, it's comfortable

92
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,290
for me to do what I
recommend these people,

93
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,040
which is if you literally
don't know each other

94
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,620
it's probably a good idea to say hello.

95
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,180
You've got a common point of view

96
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,660
of where the world's going.

97
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,020
As many people as there are here,

98
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,126
it's still a very tiny
percentage of the net score.

99
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:15,780
So for me it was comfortable to come

100
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,000
to something like this, listen to people,

101
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,140
and say hello, grab a business card,

102
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,500
send an email, try to
build a relationship.

103
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,520
I'm a big believer in serendipity,

104
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,360
I didn't chase the people on stage,

105
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,060
I knew equally that the person sitting

106
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,530
right next to me in a 13-year macro

107
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,900
might be valuable to me.

108
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,340
And so my advice to everybody who's not

109
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,790
being chased down and
cameras and all this,

110
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,600
is to say hello to the person next to them

111
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,910
because that's how life actually works.

112
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,220
Now, there's a lot of
people here that are shy.

113
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,760
You know, I grew up with
parents that had an accent.

114
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,360
This is an international show.

115
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,920
There's a million things that I can run

116
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,130
through my mind from the psychology of why

117
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,170
every person here now
won't look to the person

118
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,150
to the left and right and say hello.

119
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,070
It still doesn't make the advice wrong.

120
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,425
That is the ROI.

121
00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:06,500
My friends, everything you've seen here

122
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,020
you could watch on the
fuckin internet next week.

123
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,070
The ROI of coming to this thing

124
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,720
is to engage with the people
next to you right this second.

125
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,970
There's nothing I'm going to say right now

126
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,700
that you haven't heard
me say in some other

127
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,410
version for the last fuckin decade.

128
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,610
- And you've got to remember that

129
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,010
everybody's here to meet people.

130
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,570
That's a funny thing is like,

131
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,970
- [Nick] Yes, but.

132
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,280
Go ahead please.

133
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,420
- You're afraid of reaching out,

134
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,160
but you want to connect and you have

135
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,310
to remember that the other people

136
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,940
are thinking the exact same thing.

137
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,340
When you ask people why do you come

138
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,410
to something like this, why do you go

139
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,930
to some conference, the answer is always

140
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:42,763
to meet other people.

141
00:05:42,763 --> 00:05:43,890
That's always the number one thing,

142
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,660
it's not to like watch
some people on stage,

143
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,200
unless it's you, but otherwise

144
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,090
it's to meet the people who are there.

145
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,940
- Yeah, I mean in South By Southwest 2007

146
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,380
Mark Zuckerberg asked me to introduce him

147
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,170
to Kevin Rose, the founder of Digg.

148
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:03,820
The world changes, and so, you know,

149
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,850
the people that get to
sit on the big stage,

150
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,530
things like this, that,
the other, they change.

151
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,180
But you have access to everybody,

152
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,120
I mean there's fuckin hundreds
of thousands of people here.

153
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,870
I'm just a very big fan of
saying hello versus pitching.

154
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,700
I wrote a book called
Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook

155
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,090
because I really wanted to establish

156
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,500
the way I think of it,
which is I just think

157
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,840
that Herb and Greg should know each other.

158
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,750
I don't think that Greg should
pitch Herb his business.

159
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,150
I think they should just say hello

160
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:38,330
and create context, and then
something may come from that.

161
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,230
And I just believe in that.

162
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,090
I don't know what else to tell you.

163
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,690
I think it's very practical.

164
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,018
- Let's talk some technology

165
00:06:46,018 --> 00:06:47,543
- Greg, say hi to Herb.

166
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:51,430
- (laughs) Greg, Herb, Marco and the guy

167
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,190
whose tag is, Robert,
now you know each other.

168
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,130
Oh, you already know each other.

169
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,100
Alright, well whatever.

170
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,700
So Gary, VaynerMedia's got a
division called VaynerSmart.

171
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,533
- [Gary] Yes.

172
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:07,110
- Where you are using new technologies,

173
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,310
AR, VR, Internet of
Things, to connect brands

174
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,360
with consumers.

175
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,680
Talk to me about being
on that cutting edge

176
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,910
how you stay on it.

177
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,950
- I got very focused on IoT,

178
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,520
products like literally your beer

179
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,200
reordering itself for
you, smart refrigerator

180
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,140
being more important than anything.

181
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,630
But the reality is VaynerSmart

182
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,360
was named three years
ago when I started it

183
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,640
and the promise didn't come true,

184
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,310
meaning it's not moving
as fast as I want it to,

185
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,410
thought it might, so now what VaynerSmart

186
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,560
does, really, is an obnoxious amount

187
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,510
of Alexa Skills and Google Home Skills

188
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,210
and even podcast marketing which is very

189
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,480
basic, that could be in media.

190
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,820
Because voice has become very real.

191
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,420
I'm spending an enormous amount of time

192
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,220
thinking about that, and
so VaynerSmart itself

193
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,520
is probably going to get rebranded

194
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,220
because it's encompassing
with AR and machine learning.

195
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,290
I'm starting to realize okay, the things

196
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,500
that I know are going to
happen in a 10 year macro,

197
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,940
but I don't know exactly when and how

198
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,200
it's going to pop.

199
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,190
I need to create a division where it's

200
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,720
highly not profitable,
because I'm just investing

201
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,340
and so VaynerSmart and some of the ML

202
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,500
and AI and AR stuff is there,

203
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,820
and then stuff that's even further out

204
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,190
like VR consumer or some
of the connected stuff

205
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,210
we're seeing here, that will just sit

206
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,000
in my investing world
and networking world,

207
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,470
not as an official department.

208
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,530
- Diagnose the problem, was it because

209
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,419
it's hard to move an
organization at the speed

210
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,089
that technology is changing?

211
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,490
- No, the technology hasn't delivered

212
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,130
on the promise of its speed.

213
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,800
I don't know one fucking consumer product

214
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,410
that's reordered itself for itself

215
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,730
for anybody in this home.

216
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,730
Like, it's always about,
my mistakes in my career

217
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,880
are always timing,

218
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,443
always.

219
00:09:01,443 --> 00:09:04,140
I understand consumer behavior so well

220
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,660
that it's been my calling card.

221
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,960
I really know that everybody's gonna

222
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,860
do a lot of things here.

223
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,540
Like online dating was obvious.

224
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,380
You know, I didn't
think it was weird dudes

225
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,213
in their basements.

226
00:09:15,213 --> 00:09:17,260
I thought it was going to be Tinder,

227
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,500
and I invested in Yobongo
and One and Highlight

228
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,850
and everything, I got unlucky that Tinder

229
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,240
was incubated inside of IAC.

230
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,550
I knew that was gonna happen,

231
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:32,470
everybody here is going
to be very deep in IoT

232
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,980
and voice and order their
toothpaste while they're,

233
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,750
it's all happening, it's not the tech,

234
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,780
the technology, so much
of the promise here,

235
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,150
is going to be four to six years later

236
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,520
than they said when they
talked to you at the booth.

237
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,810
So we move fast as fuck cause
I'm willing to lose money.

238
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,420
The technology wasn't fast.

239
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,250
- So how do you stay,

240
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,030
are you trying to plan out

241
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,810
to the four to six years when something

242
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,119
that is talked about
now is actually going to

243
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:08,100
- Always
- be enacted.

244
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,740
- Yeah, I lost a fortune last
year on voice strategists

245
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,750
cause I could taste that
it was going to be now.

246
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,090
Right, and whether it was 2018 scopes,

247
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,046
which I've signed with clients, or 2019,

248
00:10:21,046 --> 00:10:23,150
I knew it wasn't going to be 2020.

249
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,340
I can't say that for a lot

250
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,500
of the technology we see here.

251
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,220
So for me I'm not scared if I think

252
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,670
it's really close within
a year, year and a half.

253
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,010
Look, I bought cryptocurrency in 2014

254
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,840
but it wasn't because, I didn't know when

255
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,560
or how and I didn't even know if,

256
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,490
I really didn't, I just knew maybe,

257
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,630
or kinda, or probably, or why it could.

258
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,860
And when you play,

259
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,200
when you look at the world that,

260
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,030
look, I think the fundamental separation

261
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,930
that I have is really
predicated on two things.

262
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,100
I have empathy, so I'm thinking about

263
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,090
what you're thinking
about, and number two,

264
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,560
I don't care about
money in the short term.

265
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,870
If you really actually
understand what I just

266
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,120
said on those two things,
if you're actually

267
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,750
consumer centric and you don't need money

268
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,520
in the short term, you always
look like a fuckin genius.

269
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,090
- Do you have a checklist in your head

270
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,640
when you see a new
technology that you're like,

271
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,200
that this is actually going to come.

272
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,717
How do you analyze something and say,

273
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:28,383
this is something I'm going to see now,

274
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,560
this is something I'm going
to see four to six years,

275
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,820
this is something I'm going to see never.

276
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,740
- Is this something that Sally and Rick

277
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,380
that know dickshit about technology

278
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,090
are going to be interested in?

279
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,020
And that it's completely
a subjective call.

280
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,820
And then that's number one,

281
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,640
but the way I answer number one

282
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,020
is will this save somebody time?

283
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,870
I missed Uber early but I got in early

284
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,820
because I realized very quickly,

285
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,480
after I didn't realize it,

286
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,690
that they were selling
time, not transportation.

287
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,900
The reason connected
devices and IoT's gonna work

288
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,120
is it's going to save you time.

289
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,740
You don't want to go to
Duane Reade to buy Band-Aids.

290
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,900
- And sometimes I think people confuse

291
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,220
convenience with time, you know?

292
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,053
- [Nick] Yeah.

293
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:20,250
- I feel like I see things, I think

294
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,090
I see some things here
or I see some things

295
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,330
elsewhere where it might be a better way

296
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,800
to do something, but it's going

297
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,740
to take the same amount of time to do it.

298
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,840
- Well I mean look,
that's what's happening

299
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,460
with e-Commerce, right?

300
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,980
Are you saving time by
spending all of January

301
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,440
shipping shit back?

302
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,450
You know, like, you've got
to look at these things

303
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,560
it's a super fascinating game.

304
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,393
I think that's right.

305
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:40,430
You also have to think about things

306
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,720
that are nice to haves versus necessities.

307
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,440
Uber, again, just as a proxy

308
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,700
you've got to get to places.

309
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,370
That is a must.

310
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,270
Right?

311
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,840
A nice to have is a million
other things we could debate.

312
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:59,780
Look, I think the barber
shop will be disrupted.

313
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,470
Like for the most part, not for everybody,

314
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,350
but you gotta get your hair cut, right?

315
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,410
You know, I'm coming don't worry.

316
00:13:10,152 --> 00:13:11,410
I think about that.

317
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,230
If people definitely do
that often, scheduled,

318
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,180
all of that stuff will be disrupted,

319
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,950
but most of all it's I don't like people

320
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,560
and I don't like companies and businesses

321
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,800
that are ideological.

322
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,340
Like there's way too many enthusiasts here

323
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,770
that would like to see this shit happen.

324
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,200
I don't like to anything to happen,

325
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,350
I just want to try to figure out

326
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,420
what I think is going to happen.

327
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,550
And a lot of times that's put me

328
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,690
in a place where people judged me

329
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,200
and made fun of me, until they didn't.

330
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,130
All my friends made
fun of me that I signed

331
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,120
a K-Swiss sneaker deal,
cause I had the audacity

332
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,700
to think it would work,
until it all sold out

333
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,240
in four hours, and then
they stopped laughing.

334
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,540
And the reason it worked was cause I

335
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,060
understood where attention sat, right?

336
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,080
And that's how I think about the world.

337
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,320
- When something works you're a genius

338
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,530
and when it doesn't work you're a fool.

339
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,330
- Success has unlimited fathers,

340
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,120
now everybody thinks they were involved,

341
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,760
like Babin thinks he's the reason

342
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,608
the K-Swiss sneakers sold, right?

343
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:15,030
But failure has none, right?

344
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,070
Yeah, I mean look, but
that's what makes it fun.

345
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,200
If you're in a place
where you're comfortable

346
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,670
with accepting your losses, I'm proud

347
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,540
to say up here that I've had to pivot

348
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,080
VaynerSmart cause the timing of IoT

349
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,700
hasn't worked in the way
that I thought it would.

350
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,670
That's comfortable to me.

351
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,790
- It means you're watching the market.

352
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,120
- Yeah, to me that's comfortable.

353
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,340
I am so sad that so many
of you don't do things

354
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,520
because you're worried about being judged.

355
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,470
It makes me sad, like that
sucks, fuck, you know?

356
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,400
To me, that's my loss, like what's

357
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,670
that got to do with you, like I don't

358
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,480
give a shit what you think, Marco.

359
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,180
I'm doing my thing and so when you start

360
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,550
getting comfortable
with losing in the micro

361
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,330
well then you can really
start doing things

362
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,900
and so me that's why it's
comfortable to day trade.

363
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,267
If you day trade, you're
going to miss a lot,

364
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,790
you just have to make more than you miss.

365
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,300
And for me, I just am
comfortable in that mentality.

366
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,480
- When brands come to you, how comfortable

367
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,670
are they with this ride, how comfortable

368
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,650
are they with you putting them in touch

369
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,330
with something that may not be ready or

370
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,200
- I don't sell things that are not ready

371
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,630
We didn't sell any IoT.

372
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,950
Only maybe strategy of like educating them

373
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,390
on where it potentially could go.

374
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,710
- So then let me ask the flip,

375
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,920
do they want things because it's buzzy

376
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,010
even though you know
it's not going to work?

377
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,500
- Sometimes, but I don't let them

378
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,530
unless they prove to me that the headline

379
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,180
in TechCrunch or AdAge has a viable

380
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,890
business reason other than
them getting promoted.

381
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,750
By the way, not that they listen to me.

382
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,690
Like, client services sucks shit,

383
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,500
like most of my client, I mean 90, 100%

384
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,620
of my clients don't do what
I think they should do.

385
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,763
100%

386
00:15:57,975 --> 00:16:01,160
But that's why I use my
personality as an outlet

387
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,520
for me creatively, the
Gary Vee thing is far more

388
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,487
a test bed for me, I'm far more proud

389
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:10,781
of being the architect of making myself

390
00:16:10,781 --> 00:16:14,136
a personality or awareness, than I am

391
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:15,330
that I'm it.

392
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,440
Like, that's more my
parents and my environment.

393
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,140
They get the credit
for me being a good guy

394
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,590
and having charisma, that's not me.

395
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,110
I'm the architect of how I got you

396
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,700
to know who I was.

397
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,470
- In our story we put this
guy on the cover in June,

398
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,340
the story about you focused
quite a lot, actually,

399
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,260
on that division between
the personal brand

400
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,160
and the brand and it
was interesting to me.

401
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,840
I didn't realize the degree to which

402
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,540
you wanted those to feel separate.

403
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,910
- Yeah, I mean look, I don't want to be

404
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:53,000
a charlatan or a motivational speaker,

405
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,460
those aren't interesting to me.

406
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,990
But I'm also willing to people to judge me

407
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,280
and misunderstand me because I know

408
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,660
how this all plays out at the end.

409
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,319
So you can boo me in the second quarter,

410
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,919
I'll talk to you after the game.

411
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,710
- And I like the way that
you think of yourself

412
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:13,030
as an R&D lab, that's
what you, you're testing

413
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,369
things on yourself that you
think are going to pay out.

414
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,449
- Yeah, I mean like I didn't invest

415
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,060
in Facebook and Twitter
and Uber and Snapchat

416
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,130
and buy cryptocurrency in 2014

417
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,580
and launch an e-commerce
site in 1996 by accident.

418
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,070
I didn't create a brand that allowed me

419
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,520
to sign a sneaker deal bigger than 99%

420
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,070
of athletes by accident.

421
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,010
None of this is fuckin accident.

422
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,540
This is me being willing to eat shit,

423
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,310
and have humility and
take negative feedback

424
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,010
while I try to figure shit out.

425
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:45,880
I work.

426
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,180
I do shit.

427
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,380
Like while everybody's
debating, I'm doing it.

428
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,490
And I'm willing to take micro losses

429
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,120
for macro wins and most people aren't

430
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,300
because they want short term money

431
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,140
or they actually value
other people's opinions

432
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,130
over their own.

433
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,093
- On the subject of
negativity towards technology.

434
00:18:08,093 --> 00:18:09,820
- [Gary] Yes.

435
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,290
- This is slightly selfish that I'm going

436
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,170
to pivot into this, but
I think it's apropos

437
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,600
for the setting.

438
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,270
So I have this podcast
called Pessimists Archive,

439
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,220
a history of unfounded
fears of technology,

440
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,010
where we look at things that

441
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,250
why people feared and banned stuff

442
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,200
that today we think of as totally normal.

443
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,660
Gary, I know you're familiar with it

444
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,360
and I love that you are also passionate

445
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,520
about calling out when people say

446
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,350
that something, that some new technology's

447
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,930
going to change us in some
terrible, fundamental way.

448
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,000
I mean, the number of
things that are going

449
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,080
to come out of this show that then

450
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,590
people are going to talk
about for six months

451
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,720
and it's going to ruin
the way that we converse,

452
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,790
it's going to ruin the
way that we are as humans

453
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,620
and I wonder, from your perspective,

454
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,190
how you address that conversation

455
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,840
when people say, "This technology"

456
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,820
"it's fundamentally bad."

457
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,800
- I don't agree with them.

458
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,620
Go Google the kaleidoscope.

459
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,700
Kids had something in front of them

460
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,290
and it was going to ruin their,

461
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,570
you know this, you have the account,

462
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,620
we tripped into that
when we were hanging out,

463
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,750
we are lying on this.

464
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,910
My level of respect for Sean Parker

465
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,810
and Chamath, professionally, cause I don't

466
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,950
know them super well, is extraordinary.

467
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,170
It's extraordinary, I
grew up during that era.

468
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,290
They're brilliant.

469
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,480
I completely disagree with their current

470
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,340
headline grabbing
statements about Facebook.

471
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,830
Technology is exposing
who we actually are,

472
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,730
it's not changing who we are.

473
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,140
We're struggling to deal with the fact

474
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,190
that we have a lot of shortcomings

475
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,570
that we've been able to hide before,

476
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:40,570
in our personality traits,
not "Facebook changed me."

477
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,350
Guys, people like, oh everybody shows

478
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,670
their best life on Instagram
and everything's perfect,

479
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,440
that's what we always did.

480
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,450
We just had a coffee with our friend

481
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,350
and said everything was fucking great.

482
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,510
Technology is exposing who we actually are

483
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,590
and demonizing technology of the moment

484
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,700
is always, always historically incorrect.

485
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,533
- Yeah, I totally agree.

486
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:07,219
I feel like, the way I think of it

487
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:09,120
is that the shape of things change,

488
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,300
but the thing doesn't change.

489
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,700
- I have no interest in listening

490
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,320
to billionaires that
made billions on products

491
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,480
then shit on those products,
cause they're altruistic.

492
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,290
I just don't.

493
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,590
I just don't agree.

494
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,850
By the way, I may end up being wrong.

495
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,060
It's all on fuckin film.

496
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,910
I just have a funny feeling I won't.

497
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,230
- Well we survived many before.

498
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,240
- Are you kidding me?

499
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,570
Like, fuckin everything
was supposed to kill,

500
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,350
Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! was supposed

501
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,083
to ruin my fuckin life.
- That's right

502
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,590
The bicycle, the car, the Walkman

503
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,680
- It's the same shit.

504
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,080
- [Jason] People banned the Walkman

505
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,410
- Like oh, now you're stuck in your stream

506
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,490
on social, but it was way better

507
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,630
for you to watch television
for nine hours a day

508
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,280
and have three old white
guys tell you what to think.

509
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,420
Like, we're being so naive, this is about,

510
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,310
my friends, life is about choices.

511
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,750
Either we have the collective voices.

512
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:06,250
I laugh about Facebook.

513
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,830
Facebook doesn't make me watch
Russian hackers' content.

514
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,370
Me engaging with the things that are put

515
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,870
on Facebook show me
Russian hacker content.

516
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,520
You want to see how
Facebook vigs everything.

517
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,450
You know what nobody
uses, Facebook search.

518
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,900
You want to see how
Facebook actually works

519
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,800
before we demonize Facebook.

520
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,180
Go to Facebook search
right now, type in hockey.

521
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,570
Go like 17 pieces of content that show up

522
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,510
and watch fuckin hockey content

523
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,340
get shoved down your fuckin throat

524
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,020
over the next two months.

525
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,530
Facebook's not penetrating you

526
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,260
and changing your mind, there's no

527
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,500
fuckin Russian hacker that got you.

528
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,620
You fuckin actually thought those things,

529
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,800
you just don't like it.

530
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,542
- Amen.

531
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:53,600
- It's truth.

532
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,820
And we just don't want to deal.

533
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,410
We want to blame everybody
but our fuckin selves.

534
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,210
We have zero fuckin accountability.

535
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:07,030
You have subconscious
bias, deal with it, period.

536
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,730
Sorry, but it's the fuckin truth

537
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,260
it's not fuckin Facebook's fault

538
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,840
that you're a fuckin racist.

539
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,590
- You can take those photos of people

540
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,790
who are all sitting in a group

541
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,850
looking at a phone

542
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,871
- It's truth, like why are
we not having the real.

543
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:24,870
By the way, on a serious macro I'm pumped.

544
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,340
I actually think this is our societal

545
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,470
step backwards for two steps forward.

546
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,910
Like this is painful,
we're all dealing with it,

547
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,930
it doesn't feel great,
it's negativity at scale.

548
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:39,340
Like I suffocate in
negativity so the macro's

549
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,370
like, "Fuck, this sucks", but this

550
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,900
is one big step backwards, ten years,

551
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,780
by the way this doesn't stop over a day.

552
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,800
But we are going to take
massive steps forward

553
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,670
because of this, because the truth

554
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,620
is always the best conversation.

555
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,010
And let me remind you
who was hiding the truth,

556
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,090
the traditional media
companies, not Facebook.

557
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,240
So fuck you guys.

558
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,460
Like, I'm so pissed at that.

559
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,780
That is such lack of accountability

560
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,440
and then people posturing
after they made their money,

561
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,480
fuck you.

562
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,320
- Wait, I want you to expand more on that,

563
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,780
traditional media
companies hiding the truth.

564
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,250
- Matt Lauer got away with it because

565
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,440
of NBC and ABC and the
Wall Street Journal,

566
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,330
not because of Facebook and Twitter.

567
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,450
The internet is now the
media company, period.

568
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,460
Which means everybody has an at bat.

569
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,920
There's the commerce
and branding side of it,

570
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,020
which I love, like I'd
still be in New Jersey

571
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,700
with a bunch of liquor
stores if the Internet

572
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,680
didn't come along.

573
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,480
There's a lot of that,

574
00:23:44,202 --> 00:23:47,880
when you could literally
call Rupert Murdoch

575
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,600
and be like, "Yo bro,
you've got some reporter"

576
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,140
"at Fox that's investigating me"

577
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,420
"like shut that shit down",

578
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,130
and they did, that's how the world worked.

579
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,560
That's not how it works anymore.

580
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,200
That's the bottom line.

581
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,440
So that's what I mean, like you decide

582
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,490
what the fuck's in Entrepreneur magazine.

583
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,550
- I do.

584
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,680
It doesn't mean I decide
who is an entrepreneur.

585
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,690
- That's for sure, but guess what,

586
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,500
you kinda do, because
what I mean by that is,

587
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,350
and we all do that, it's just
that we can all do that now.

588
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,870
Like every single person here can use the,

589
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,970
distribution has been commoditized.

590
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,100
I, as a personality, as a human,

591
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,260
has as much of an
Entrepreneur, like audience,

592
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,450
as now media companies.

593
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,230
I mean, that's absurd.

594
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,690
That is unbelievable transformative.

595
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,390
- And it's not just that
but then media companies

596
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,960
come to you because they
want to reach your audience.

597
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,500
- 100%, and it works back and forth.

598
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,700
It's leverage of attention.

599
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,810
I'm just so happy that
the truth has momentum,

600
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,190
and look, it's going to
change us tremendously

601
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,210
because not one of us, including me,

602
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,510
doesn't have human shortcomings,

603
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,550
and we're going to need to reconcile that.

604
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,870
The era of hypocrisy is in trouble.

605
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,800
We're gonna eat shit,
have a lot of casualties,

606
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,770
but then our grandkids are going to live

607
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,360
in a world where we accept
each other's shortcomings

608
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,160
way more than we do now,

609
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,260
because nobody's going to be able to hide.

610
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,010
Ten years ago, a lot more people

611
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,760
went to the strip clubs last night.

612
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,730
Now, with media
everywhere, a lot of people

613
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,850
rethought their decisions last night.

614
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,740
The world's changed, that's just real.

615
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,040
That's just the truth.

616
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,280
So I think that's fascinating, I think

617
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,970
that plays out in a
million different ways.

618
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,190
- I don't know that
you'll even have an answer

619
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,195
to it, but just to play the other side

620
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:41,410
- Yes
- Anything concern you?

621
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,650
What do you see that concerns you?

622
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,140
- Nothing.

623
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,160
I'm being serious, let me tell you why.

624
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,500
I like data, here's my punchline.

625
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,680
We human beings have done
a really good fuckin job

626
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,180
adjusting along the way.

627
00:25:56,234 --> 00:25:58,860
You know what's way scarier
than Russian hackers?

628
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,200
The Black Plague.

629
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:08,260
I don't know, like fuckin
concentration camps

630
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,480
seem a hell of a lot
scarier to me contextually

631
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,500
than naked selfies.

632
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,010
- So here's what's scary,

633
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,500
we forget how terrible that shit was.

634
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,333
Right?

635
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,170
- That's how it gets repeated

636
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,750
- That's right.

637
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,290
We forget that we had those fears.

638
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,000
We forget that we fought the battles.

639
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,930
- There's people literally mad that people

640
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,390
gave them skim milk instead of almond milk

641
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,740
in this audience right now.

642
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,690
Like do you understand
how fucked up shit is?

643
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,950
Like we have zero perspective,

644
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,340
a good friend of mine,
who knows me super well,

645
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,470
last night at a dinner, or two nights ago,

646
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,890
said to me, was acting weird with me.

647
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,740
And we got into a little conversation

648
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,830
and he was kind of
razzing me subconsciously

649
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,920
that I only put out positive content

650
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,660
and that it's a facade.

651
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,420
And this is like, if any of you said that

652
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,630
I'd be like, "Oh, I totally
get it, let me explain."

653
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,160
But this is somebody that fairly knows me

654
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,510
for like a decade, I was
at his wedding, right?

655
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:08,640
I don't go to a lot of weddings,

656
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,500
for context, so like tight.

657
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,850
And it was fascinating
to me, I was like wow,

658
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,810
people are uncomfortable with people

659
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:20,350
that have really, like
my mom is the same way,

660
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:23,650
like I just have unbelievably
deep perspective,

661
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,160
which is the following,

662
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,330
unless the eight people
that I love the most

663
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:33,100
are really sick,
everything else means dick.

664
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,330
I mean that, Maria.

665
00:27:38,412 --> 00:27:41,430
I'm in a struggle to lose money today,

666
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,910
or somebody said I was a,
you know, when AdAge said

667
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,070
the what the fuck moment was
my sneaker and razzed me.

668
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,120
That means nothing.

669
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,360
So what scares me as a collective?

670
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,220
Nothing.

671
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,900
In the micro, the health and well-being

672
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,430
of the people I love the most.

673
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,060
Everything else is controllable,

674
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,740
everything else is my fault.

675
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,960
- You know, something we have in common

676
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,620
is that we're both in positions,

677
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,240
to build off of what you just said,

678
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,750
we're both in positions of positivity.

679
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,910
I feel very fortunate about it

680
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,010
because inside me, I don't
know about inside you,

681
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,530
but inside me I've got a lot of enthusiasm

682
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,920
and positivity, I've also
got a lot of deep skepticism.

683
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,890
But I know that what people want from me

684
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:27,470
is positivity, that's valuable to them.

685
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,980
And so, it puts me in that place

686
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,300
where I can feel that the most,

687
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,990
where I can exude that the most

688
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,610
and I think you're probably experiencing

689
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,530
something similar
- You know what's funny?

690
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,580
I have come to finally realize

691
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,120
that I realize that I mean nothing,

692
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,870
which then doesn't allow me to have

693
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:48,340
the audacity to be cynical or skeptical.

694
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,840
You know?

695
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,380
I'm empathetic, and by the way,

696
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,150
parents having sex at the right moment

697
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,210
giving me DNA, like this is not me,

698
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:00,020
but I'm like, "Why am I not skeptical?"

699
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,560
"Why am I not cynical?"

700
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,350
Oh, because what the fuck does my opinion

701
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,010
mean in that for, like
the amount of people

702
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,500
dropping their two cents on social media

703
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,110
to shit on somebody,
like they mean something.

704
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:17,050
People try to build the
biggest building in town

705
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,510
by tearing everybody else's building down.

706
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,270
When you have enough talent to just build

707
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,830
the biggest building, you just
build the biggest building.

708
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,840
I could give a fuck about anybody else,

709
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,430
I'm doing me, and honestly, I wish all

710
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,890
of you the best, and I even
weirdly hope you beat me

711
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,520
cause that will keep me hungry.

712
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,440
But the truth is, I'm not worried

713
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,590
about other people's shit.

714
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,090
We're counting everybody
else's points too much.

715
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,540
Worry about your own shit.

716
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,640
- So we got a few minutes left

717
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,030
and let's do it by building people up,

718
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,060
if we're just talking about that,

719
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,120
- Great.
- So we had a guy,

720
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,920
had a conversation with Samsung folks here

721
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,860
just before you came on
where they were asking me,

722
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,120
Samsung's looking to partner

723
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,200
with barrier redefining people,

724
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,350
really amazing entrepreneurs
who are pushing boundaries

725
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,840
and I said, you know who they should ask,

726
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,600
they should ask you,
and actually fuck that,

727
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,720
why don't I just ask you on
stage, put you on the spot,

728
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,120
who should we all be really excited about?

729
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,570
- So one of the things that I,

730
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,100
you know it's funny you
asked me that question

731
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,490
off of what I just said,

732
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:19,500
I'm spending almost zero
time paying attention

733
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,285
to anybody else, so I struggle with this.

734
00:30:22,285 --> 00:30:24,320
And then the only answers I know

735
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,570
are people that are
really within my circle.

736
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,860
So, I hate this question cause my head

737
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,560
goes to a funny couple places, right?

738
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,950
Rachel Tipograph.

739
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:35,340
But I invested in her company,
so it feels self serving

740
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,290
so I hate to, I never give the answer,

741
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,640
but the only reason I know is cause I sit

742
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,340
on the board and I watch her navigate

743
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,760
and I think shes's a ninja,

744
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,490
and an incredible entrepreneur, right?

745
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,710
I think she's special.

746
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,320
So like, the answer is the names I know

747
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,750
are like 20 people, all
who are self-serving,

748
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,330
so outside of Rachel I
won't name any of them,

749
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,860
but it's the ones that I can actually

750
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,460
see what they're actually doing.

751
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,920
And there's a lot of people
doing incredible stuff,

752
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,510
a ton of people.

753
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,270
As you can tell I'm very passionate

754
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,830
about the shit I know,

755
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,930
I get really quiet when I don't know

756
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,710
and the truth is I really don't know.

757
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,130
I really don't know, I'm not
paying attention to that.

758
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,850
I spend 100% of my time
on consumer behavior,

759
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,920
I care about what you're gonna do,

760
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,730
I obsess over it, I spend
18 hours a day over it.

761
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:24,020
I try to find out why
eight-year-old girls make slime.

762
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,610
I try to find out why Champion

763
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,960
went from being a private label at Walmart

764
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,820
to the brand that has the
most swag in the streets.

765
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,120
I try to think about what Cardi B did.

766
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,060
I try to think about,
you know, what's going on

767
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,220
on Youtube Kids and like why is Siri

768
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,610
every six-year-old's best friend?

769
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:43,720
I am like, that's what I spend my time on.

770
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,160
You're amazing at knowing their answer,

771
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,390
that's what you guys spend your time on.

772
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:51,900
So I suck shit at 98% of things,

773
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,020
it's in that 2% that I'm
going to be all time.

774
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,770
- But your answer actually
brings us full circle

775
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,010
to the beginning of our conversation,

776
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:00,710
which is about meeting
people and discovering

777
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,090
how great they are,
because your answer is,

778
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,950
well the people that I know I've gotten

779
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,880
to understand what their strengths are,

780
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,430
what their genius is,

781
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,070
and so the answer is go expand,

782
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,390
I mean, to everybody here, right,

783
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,440
but to everybody, you
go expand your network

784
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,460
and then you understand
the great resources

785
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,050
in people that you have around you.

786
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,640
- I think so, and, you know,
I think it's interesting,

787
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,670
there's a lot of variables to why somebody

788
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,840
gets put on a pedestal,

789
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,270
and I'm, listen, I am massively benefiting

790
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,300
from having a lot of sizzle,

791
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,760
but the only way to win long term

792
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,790
is to have the steak,

793
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:39,560
and I'm always trying to be thoughtful of,

794
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,660
like, and I think sizzle's special,

795
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,235
like I don't downplay, like oh you,

796
00:32:43,235 --> 00:32:44,990
to have sizzle means something,

797
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:47,490
and it's, by the way, most
of the people you know.

798
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,830
To say who's a great entrepreneur,

799
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,950
it's somebody that I think is going

800
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,950
to be sitting there, you know, look,

801
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:57,690
guys we've lived now through
literally almost nine years

802
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:01,290
of complete global economic growth.

803
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,080
Shit has been great.

804
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,330
Like, when I look at
everybody under 30 in here,

805
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,720
and I'm like, oh my God, never

806
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,810
in their professional life have they hit

807
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:13,380
a tremendous recession or
a massive market crash.

808
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,630
It's so fun, like I'm looking around like

809
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:21,546
I would say 65, 70% of
everybody's faces I see here

810
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:25,550
didn't even live through
2008, let alone 2001,

811
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,970
let alone the mid 90s.

812
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,820
It's super easy right now.

813
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,690
There's so much money in the system.

814
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,450
All these entrepreneur startup people

815
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,060
that everybody looks up to,
they lose money every month.

816
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,080
It doesn't take a hero to
lose money every month.

817
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,070
Everybody here can lose money every month.

818
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:48,110
I've run businesses for
22 years of my life,

819
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,350
every day of my life,
and I've never, ever,

820
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,770
ever raised any capital,

821
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:54,540
and I've made money every single year.

822
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,920
Like, that's a skillset, so that's

823
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,000
what a great entrepreneur is to me,

824
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,420
not riding a golden era and was able

825
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,500
to raise capital, she or he.

826
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,630
No, running a business.

827
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:08,750
Now, that bubble will burst

828
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,380
and then we'll get to
see who's still around

829
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,550
and then we'll see everybody else

830
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,699
who says entrepreneur in their Instagram

831
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,879
profile right now, when they're working

832
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,510
in Bank of America in 24 months.

833
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,031
And so that's what I'm waiting for.

834
00:34:21,031 --> 00:34:24,510
I'm most excited for, and waiting for,

835
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:29,199
and hoping for complete
global economic carnage.

836
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,129
So that we can weed out
the B and C and D players.

837
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,500
- Well Jesus, if you had stopped talking

838
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,090
a minute ago we would
have ended on a high note,

839
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,909
but instead we ended on that.

840
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,369
- I don't think, by the way,

841
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,130
that's where I think this is so fun.

842
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,440
I think that is a high note.

843
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,719
It's the same way I'm looking
at what's happening now.

844
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,489
The truth should win.

845
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:50,819
If you're a piece of
shit, you should lose.

846
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,699
If you're not a good entrepreneur,

847
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,529
you should have a job.

848
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:59,100
Merit and the truth are always
the winners in the macro.

849
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,860
We're just in a micro right now,

850
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,580
and people are confused.

851
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,710
- Everyone you have your mission,

852
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,100
introduce yourselves to each other

853
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,457
and give it up for Gary.

854
00:35:06,457 --> 00:35:07,570
(audience applauds)

855
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,403
- Thanks guys.

856
00:35:09,514 --> 00:00:00,000
(relaxed music)
