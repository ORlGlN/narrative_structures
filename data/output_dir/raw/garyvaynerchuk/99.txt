1
00:00:00,936 --> 00:00:03,033
- Hey, guys, here in Stockholm

2
00:00:03,033 --> 00:00:06,309
With my homie from Arctic Startup, John.

3
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:10,584
Going to the airport
and heading back to NYC.

4
00:00:10,584 --> 00:00:14,694
But in this video, I was
actually in Hong Kong doing Q&A.

5
00:00:14,694 --> 00:00:17,789
Some really interesting insights,
some different stuff was

6
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,494
pulled out of me and so
I hope you enjoy it and

7
00:00:21,494 --> 00:00:23,969
just wanna thank all
of you for following me

8
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:27,380
on all of the platforms and
if you haven't subscribed yet

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,310
to the Youtube and are
just stumbling here,

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,346
or continue watching it,
but aren't subscribed,

11
00:00:31,346 --> 00:00:33,816
I'd love that and hope you
guys are doing super well.

12
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:35,316
See ya, much love.

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,743
(jazzy downtempo music)

14
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:44,947
- Please welcome, the
social juggernaut himself,

15
00:00:44,947 --> 00:00:46,614
Mr, Gary Vaynerchuk.

16
00:00:53,235 --> 00:00:54,964
- [Man] And no introduction for me.

17
00:00:54,964 --> 00:00:55,851
- I did it...
(laughing)

18
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:58,039
- Thank you, thank you.

19
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,977
Oh my god.
(whoops)

20
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,902
There's a big crowd.

21
00:01:01,902 --> 00:01:03,127
Gary V.

22
00:01:03,127 --> 00:01:05,215
Thank you very much for
coming, really appreciate it.

23
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:06,601
- Thanks for having me.

24
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:11,330
- This is incredible because
as Brendan mentioned,

25
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,584
I've been working on this
for the past six months,

26
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:15,892
actually met your team in New York City

27
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:18,817
and we jammed a little
bit, so it was amazing,

28
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:21,494
but I don't wanna spend
too much time on this,

29
00:01:21,494 --> 00:01:23,014
I really wanna give people

30
00:01:23,014 --> 00:01:24,962
a chance to ask you
some questions later on,

31
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:27,065
but I wanna set some
context for that, because

32
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:28,939
I dunno, probably there are some people

33
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:32,348
that don't know you so much, so

34
00:01:32,348 --> 00:01:34,503
the first thing I wanna talk about.

35
00:01:34,503 --> 00:01:37,134
I watched the interview

36
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:39,573
that you did with Tom from Impact Theory

37
00:01:39,573 --> 00:01:41,645
and he did incredible job.
- Yeah, he did.

38
00:01:41,645 --> 00:01:45,048
- And one thing that I really enjoyed

39
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:48,965
was the 51/49 Karma and Practicality

40
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,568
and all of these things, could
you just talk about that?

41
00:01:52,568 --> 00:01:55,814
Like being a nice person,
bringing value first,

42
00:01:55,814 --> 00:01:58,353
what it means for you and then we can

43
00:01:58,353 --> 00:02:01,777
go deeper, how other
people should manage it

44
00:02:01,777 --> 00:02:03,212
when they're just getting started,

45
00:02:03,212 --> 00:02:05,464
because I think that's super
relevant for these guys,

46
00:02:05,464 --> 00:02:06,781
'cause we're just getting started.

47
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:08,246
We're not so big as you are,

48
00:02:08,246 --> 00:02:10,518
but we should provide
even more value probably,

49
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:12,664
but also we need to focus
on the business, right?

50
00:02:12,664 --> 00:02:13,818
Business side and building it,

51
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:16,159
so could you just talk
about it a little bit?

52
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,609
- Sure, first of all, thank
you guys all so much for coming

53
00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:23,551
it's awesome to be here.
(applause)

54
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:26,301
Yeah, I think Karma is practical.

55
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:31,052
I'm confused by people's
inability to understand

56
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:33,135
how human beings work and

57
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,632
I think that a lot of
the reason that startups

58
00:02:37,632 --> 00:02:40,299
are gonna fail at a record rate,

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,809
which is exactly what's gonna happen

60
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:46,655
over the next decade, is that
so many people in this room

61
00:02:46,655 --> 00:02:48,643
are gonna build their business

62
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:52,321
in the eyes of a VC not
in the eyes of the market.

63
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:55,888
All of their behavior will be
predicated on raising capital,

64
00:02:55,888 --> 00:02:57,761
not on bringing value.

65
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,623
You know, at it's core,

66
00:02:59,623 --> 00:03:03,198
the reason I'm answering
this question that way is,

67
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:06,421
you have to reverse
engineer what you want.

68
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:09,713
The greater your ambition for legacy

69
00:03:09,713 --> 00:03:14,551
and something meaningful, the
greater you are as a person

70
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:16,777
'cause it's really the only practical way

71
00:03:16,777 --> 00:03:19,036
to actually pull it off.

72
00:03:19,036 --> 00:03:23,221
You have to provide more value
than you asked for in return.

73
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:25,971
And so for me, all I wanna do is,

74
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:31,433
I think about being entrepreneur
like being an athlete.

75
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:34,378
I think about my life when
I don't have my jersey on,

76
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:37,258
and I think about my life
when I have my jersey on.

77
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,469
And when I'm an entrepreneur,

78
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:40,532
when I put on my jersey in the morning,

79
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:43,558
there's two main goals in my mind.

80
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:47,725
One, to build the greatest
legacy of being an entrepreneur,

81
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:52,867
what I would consider getting
into the hall of fame,

82
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:55,220
and two, that's my macro.

83
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,835
And my micro is to be
successful that day, right?

84
00:03:58,835 --> 00:04:01,882
It's a day in, day out thing, so yeah.

85
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:06,049
My thesis is that I need to
bring more value in my content,

86
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:09,657
I need to bring more
value to my employees,

87
00:04:09,657 --> 00:04:12,844
I need to bring more value to my clients,

88
00:04:12,844 --> 00:04:17,326
I prefer the leverage of
being more valuable to you

89
00:04:17,326 --> 00:04:19,459
than you are to me.

90
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,473
It's actually quite practical.

91
00:04:21,474 --> 00:04:24,276
If I'm more valuable to
you than you are to me,

92
00:04:24,276 --> 00:04:27,063
that ultimately should
work itself out for me

93
00:04:27,063 --> 00:04:30,240
in the long term, and
I only play long term.

94
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,780
Like really, really long term.

95
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,253
Like, the end.
(laughing)

96
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:38,637
And I don't think most people do,

97
00:04:38,637 --> 00:04:42,804
I am so grateful that I'm wired
and parented in a way where,

98
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:49,651
when I was making $50,000
a year, that was...

99
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:52,282
I'm gonna say something that confuses me,

100
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:54,866
I just think $50,000
a year is enough money

101
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:57,116
to live your life, I dunno.

102
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,436
It's not enough if you
wanna have a fuckin' yacht

103
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:03,499
in the fucking water out there,

104
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:07,416
but I have not been driven
by capital and money

105
00:05:08,695 --> 00:05:10,112
pretty much ever.

106
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:14,198
You know, look at my
actions versus my words,

107
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:18,799
I built my family's business
to a much bigger business

108
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:20,174
than it was.

109
00:05:20,174 --> 00:05:21,782
I entered my dad's business, it was doing

110
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:24,285
three-point-something
million dollars in sales,

111
00:05:24,285 --> 00:05:29,122
I left it as a business that
was doing $60 million in sales,

112
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:31,955
I own zero percent of WineLibrary.

113
00:05:33,723 --> 00:05:37,700
Zero, I then started, on
the back of what I was doing

114
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,516
as a marketer, a new
company called VaynerMedia,

115
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:43,802
my brother AJ was graduating from college,

116
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:48,304
he was no experience, no
equity in the marketplace,

117
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:52,471
we started VaynerMedia and
that company was 50/50.

118
00:05:55,837 --> 00:05:59,168
I just am not driven by economics

119
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:02,197
and that's fine, 'cause, by the way,

120
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:04,203
if you are, great.

121
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:07,578
It's just that I give more than I receive

122
00:06:07,578 --> 00:06:11,658
because it's the game
I'm actually playing.

123
00:06:11,658 --> 00:06:12,845
And you have to decide your game,

124
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:15,118
if your game is predicated
on you wanna own

125
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:18,433
a yacht and a nice home and a gold watch,

126
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:20,262
then that's fine, then
you should care about

127
00:06:20,262 --> 00:06:22,696
short term economics.

128
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:26,863
But short term economic
strategies leave you vulnerable.

129
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:30,714
- You know what I love about you?

130
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:32,463
That you actually care about people

131
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:34,396
and there are two stories, so first,

132
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:36,417
I don't know if you remember,
but first time we met

133
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:39,865
was actually in Lisbon,
so I was waiting for you

134
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:41,640
at the speaker prep

135
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,100
and I just wanted to have the book signed

136
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,722
and you arrived late, the
bodyguards were pushing,

137
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:48,473
you cannot go in, and
I told you "Hey, Gary,

138
00:06:48,473 --> 00:06:50,358
"I'm a big fan, I just
want this book signed."

139
00:06:50,358 --> 00:06:53,023
And you said, "Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm speaking in five minutes,"

140
00:06:53,023 --> 00:06:55,536
but you went in, you just
put your luggage there,

141
00:06:55,536 --> 00:06:57,970
and then you came out and signed my book.

142
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,522
And the same thing
happened, I have a friend,

143
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:02,006
he's over there, so I was
sitting with him yesterday,

144
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:04,185
and he took a selfie with you at Rice,

145
00:07:04,185 --> 00:07:08,217
and then he tweeted it,
and you liked his tweet.

146
00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:10,121
And he was going crazy about it, you know.

147
00:07:10,121 --> 00:07:12,350
He was like, Ahhhh, you know.
(cheering from crowd)

148
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,066
So I love this about you that
you actually spend the time,

149
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:16,739
now we are in a Tesla, we are driving here

150
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:19,147
and you are just tweeting
and checking Instagram,

151
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,049
and you're just doing it all the time,

152
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:24,573
the work ethic, you know,
you're just online all the time.

153
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:26,990
- If you were privileged enough for people

154
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,240
to actually care that you like a Tweet?

155
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,649
Then you need to take that responsibility

156
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:36,841
and do something with it, like
I will never take for granted

157
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:41,008
like guys, I have been somebody
who loved entrepreneurship

158
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,993
and I didn't call it entrepreneurship,

159
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:46,624
I'm old I'm 41, I called it
being a businessman, right?

160
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:49,525
This was everything and
anything I ever wanted to do.

161
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:54,404
If you thought, at any
time, in my teenage years,

162
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:58,178
that I thought that being
a successful entrepreneur

163
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:02,032
would lead to people treating
you like a successful athlete

164
00:08:02,032 --> 00:08:06,179
or rockstar, there was
no part of the vision

165
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:08,945
that that was gonna be any part of it.

166
00:08:08,945 --> 00:08:11,695
So the added value of admiration,

167
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,958
is such a cherry on top,
it's why I push people

168
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,866
to do the thing they love the most.

169
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:20,381
You don't know how the
world's gonna play out.

170
00:08:20,381 --> 00:08:23,621
All my friends who are such
unbelievable video game players

171
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:26,956
in the 90s, whose parents made
them stop playing video games

172
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:30,938
to be a lawyer, none of us
knew that e-sports was coming.

173
00:08:30,938 --> 00:08:33,327
They could've been the Tony Hawk,

174
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:34,160
right?

175
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:37,426
Like, you don't know
where the world's going.

176
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:40,590
Too many people make decisions
on how the world is today

177
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,082
and they're making decisions
about 14 years from now

178
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:46,075
as if the world will stay still.

179
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:49,741
So I can't wrap my head
around taking for granted

180
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:53,400
people thinking I'm cool
and I will work hard

181
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,728
to show my gratitude
for the rest of my life.

182
00:08:56,728 --> 00:08:58,666
- Yeah, but also it's
amazing business strategy,

183
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,094
because we were just
talking in the car about

184
00:09:01,094 --> 00:09:05,806
Jake Paul and Logan and
they're just building an empire

185
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:09,082
just by doing YouTube videos
and engaging their fans

186
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,895
and basically just like
showing them the love.

187
00:09:11,895 --> 00:09:14,041
So it's amazing business
strategy at the same time,

188
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,207
- Yeah, but it's only a nuance.

189
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:18,239
You can't show people love
unless you did something

190
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,933
that made them like
you in the first place.

191
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:21,364
- Yeah, yeah.
- So what Jake

192
00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:23,728
and Logan Paul are, are
incredible programmers

193
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:26,754
and producers and content
producers for a new environment,

194
00:09:26,754 --> 00:09:29,645
no different than Steven
Spielberg and George Lucas were

195
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:33,512
for the theater environment
of the late 70s.

196
00:09:33,512 --> 00:09:37,550
I think we underestimate
what it takes to be a KOL

197
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,281
in today's environment, we
think it's easy for some reason,

198
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:46,156
'cause it feels so remarkable
that if you're cute, or funny,

199
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,010
like it just feels weird, right?

200
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,260
Like oh my god,

201
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:53,364
you're just charismatic
or have a nice smile

202
00:09:53,364 --> 00:09:55,304
or a great figure and now all of a sudden

203
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:57,717
you're making a lot of money.

204
00:09:57,717 --> 00:10:01,431
The reality is being
pretty always made money,

205
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:03,080
it was called modeling.

206
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,374
(chuckling)

207
00:10:04,374 --> 00:10:06,179
Being funny always made money,

208
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:08,861
you just did it on stage,
that's what Richard Prior

209
00:10:08,861 --> 00:10:10,943
and Eddie Murphy did and now,

210
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,746
King Batch might just do
it on Vine or Instagram.

211
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,477
Nothing's new, the mediums are new.

212
00:10:16,477 --> 00:10:20,026
Do not have the audacity to underestimate

213
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:23,472
what it takes to have enough
success that a lot of people

214
00:10:23,472 --> 00:10:25,567
pay attention to you.

215
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,960
Do not underestimate that.

216
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,946
You're thrilled to, but the
market is smarter than you.

217
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:37,411
- [Jan] Awesome, and now,
we are in Hong Kong, right?

218
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:38,765
This is your first time.
- Yes.

219
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:40,025
- [Jan] This is your
first time in Hong Kong.

220
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:41,595
- Yes.
- How do you like it?

221
00:10:41,595 --> 00:10:45,474
- You know, it's funny, Drock and I landed

222
00:10:45,474 --> 00:10:48,166
and we didn't even leave baggage claim,

223
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,215
that's 5:04 in the morning,
we're in baggage claim.

224
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:53,354
And I looked at him and I go,

225
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:55,098
I think I'm gonna fuckin' love this place.

226
00:10:55,098 --> 00:10:56,645
(laughing)

227
00:10:56,645 --> 00:10:59,196
It's been an unbelievable trip,

228
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:01,569
I texted my wife and said
we're moving to Hong Kong.

229
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:03,276
(laughing)

230
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:06,362
(cheering and applause)
I'm not moving to Hong Kong.

231
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:09,029
I'm not moving to Hong Kong, but

232
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:15,278
I see a lot of familiar
faces, there are people here

233
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:16,332
who do know me.

234
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:17,499
I need action.

235
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:21,119
Hong Kong has action, so it's interesting.

236
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:23,192
- Well I guess China has action, too.

237
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:27,468
And so because on your daily
feed, sending your content,

238
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:29,353
you have been pushing China quite a bit.

239
00:11:29,353 --> 00:11:32,928
- I've been alluding to some ambitions.

240
00:11:32,928 --> 00:11:35,329
- One of the latest daily
piece, or not latest,

241
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:36,993
because you do it every day, but,

242
00:11:36,993 --> 00:11:38,472
you were in Cannes and you said

243
00:11:38,472 --> 00:11:40,009
you're gonna dominate
China in three years,

244
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:41,547
so tell me, why China?

245
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:43,500
Why do you care about China right now

246
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,897
and what's the strategy that
you're executing against

247
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:46,859
right now.

248
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:47,948
- I don't know if you heard,

249
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:49,419
but there's a lot of people there.

250
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:52,166
(laughing)

251
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:52,999
One thing,

252
00:11:53,976 --> 00:11:55,892
again, something that I
think some of you have heard,

253
00:11:55,892 --> 00:11:57,423
I don't like talking about things

254
00:11:57,423 --> 00:12:01,355
that I don't know and I
don't have the audacity

255
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:04,710
to think that my brand or my
businesses could be successful

256
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,329
in China until I'm very
thoughtful and committed

257
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:09,879
to giving that a chance.

258
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:13,288
And so, I'm starting to feel
good about the infrastructure

259
00:12:13,288 --> 00:12:15,857
of the Vayner Machine in a US standpoint,

260
00:12:15,857 --> 00:12:18,274
in a European standpoint, and

261
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,430
to be very frank,
intuitively, intuitively,

262
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,236
I just feel like it's time for Asia.

263
00:12:26,236 --> 00:12:29,503
Which is why I said yes to Rise,

264
00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:31,503
which is why I said yes
to the event I'm doing

265
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:33,677
in Singapore in October.

266
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:36,495
I've never, not only have
I never been to Hong Kong,

267
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:38,562
I've never been to Asia,

268
00:12:38,562 --> 00:12:39,988
prior to this trip.

269
00:12:39,988 --> 00:12:42,161
I've been to India,
I've been to Australia,

270
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,714
depending on how you
want to define things,

271
00:12:43,714 --> 00:12:45,699
but I've not been to
this part of the world

272
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:46,949
and ironically,

273
00:12:48,088 --> 00:12:51,494
the purity of entrepreneurship, and

274
00:12:51,494 --> 00:12:54,289
maybe purity is not the
right word, the rawness

275
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:59,100
of the entrepreneurship in
Asia is far more aligned with

276
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,700
my rawness of entrepreneurship
than the US or Europe,

277
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,749
so I think it's gonna
be very native to me,

278
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:08,450
I'm excited about it, I think
I have a humongous advantage

279
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,339
in being born in Soviet Russia, so I come

280
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,167
with a lot of humility, of the
amount of work and listening

281
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:17,545
I'm gonna have to do over
the next two to three years.

282
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:19,712
I like challenging myself,

283
00:13:20,762 --> 00:13:23,894
I feel like I'm one of
the only people on earth

284
00:13:23,894 --> 00:13:26,097
that can literally amass
billions of dollars

285
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,180
and still be deemed a failure
if I don't buy the jets.

286
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,946
(laughing)
You know.

287
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:33,279
So when i shift, like
I'm gonna dominate China

288
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,074
in three years, that's to motivate me.

289
00:13:35,074 --> 00:13:37,770
That's me playing my own game for myself,

290
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,230
I think I won't be doing anything close

291
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,494
to dominating China
over the next two years,

292
00:13:42,494 --> 00:13:44,549
even though I'm gonna
put in a lot of work,

293
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:45,853
and then I think I'm gonna understand

294
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:47,491
and I'm gonna turn it on.

295
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:49,965
And I do think in a three
year macro, five year macro,

296
00:13:49,965 --> 00:13:51,447
I'll have some success.

297
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:54,225
Because I think it's intuitive and native

298
00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:56,615
and very aligned with my spirit.

299
00:13:56,615 --> 00:13:59,877
And I also think the youth,
the entrepreneurial youth

300
00:13:59,877 --> 00:14:04,044
of China, both on patience
and on their relationship

301
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:07,433
with their parents, are
gonna get a lot of value

302
00:14:07,433 --> 00:14:09,275
out of my content.

303
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:10,108
- Awesome.

304
00:14:11,045 --> 00:14:12,617
And actually, I just
wanna follow up on this,

305
00:14:12,617 --> 00:14:14,423
because you said you don't
like to talk about things

306
00:14:14,423 --> 00:14:17,094
that you don't understand,
but this morning,

307
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:18,947
we are having breakfast and you,

308
00:14:18,947 --> 00:14:20,485
actually, lunch, after lunch,

309
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,826
and you actually know a lot of things

310
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:24,766
about China in terms of
where the KOL industry is

311
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:25,959
and this, how do you do this?

312
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:28,723
Do you have people in your
team that are doing it for you

313
00:14:28,723 --> 00:14:30,038
and then you just analyze,

314
00:14:30,038 --> 00:14:31,611
or do you actually read something?

315
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:34,113
How do you absorb this information,

316
00:14:34,113 --> 00:14:36,621
because you're so busy
running around the world

317
00:14:36,621 --> 00:14:40,312
speaking and doing business,
so how do you manage this?

318
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,418
- So Drock, right before,
right when I got off

319
00:14:43,418 --> 00:14:46,150
the stage right now
back at the conference,

320
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,735
said to me, it's been really cool for him

321
00:14:47,735 --> 00:14:50,387
to watch me navigate here
over the last two days.

322
00:14:50,387 --> 00:14:53,687
He asked me, did you
read anything about...?

323
00:14:53,687 --> 00:14:55,096
The market, and I said no.

324
00:14:55,096 --> 00:14:57,750
And I think he intuitively understood that

325
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,339
that was gonna be the answer.

326
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,503
Listen, the one thing I think,

327
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:04,223
so I think if you know who I am.

328
00:15:04,223 --> 00:15:07,135
If I say to you the word hustle,

329
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:10,183
that seems very natural,
you know I care about that,

330
00:15:10,183 --> 00:15:11,266
I talk about that.

331
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:13,350
If I say the word to you, smart,

332
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,054
that feels foreign, because
I never speak about it.

333
00:15:16,054 --> 00:15:18,049
I rarely, if ever,

334
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:21,600
talk about how smart I am, I mean that.

335
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,302
And the reason I don't talk about it,

336
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:27,627
is 'cause I don't think that
that brings you any value.

337
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:30,798
You know, I think making
you realize that work ethic

338
00:15:30,798 --> 00:15:32,676
is a variable that is
far more controllable

339
00:15:32,676 --> 00:15:35,273
than almost anything else
that is a direct indicator

340
00:15:35,273 --> 00:15:38,348
on your success is a
valuable conversation.

341
00:15:38,348 --> 00:15:40,614
I think me telling you that
the answer to your question is

342
00:15:40,614 --> 00:15:42,714
that I absorb information

343
00:15:42,714 --> 00:15:45,648
so quickly and synthesize
it through a filter

344
00:15:45,648 --> 00:15:48,808
that is so intuitive, that
I'm successful at marketing

345
00:15:48,808 --> 00:15:50,746
and communications is

346
00:15:50,746 --> 00:15:53,701
cool for me, for myself,
and I'm happy about it,

347
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:55,599
but not something I speak to.

348
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:56,432
I think,

349
00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:01,884
I understand human beings,
period, end of story.

350
00:16:01,884 --> 00:16:04,327
And I understand and I respect

351
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:06,484
cultural differences and nuances,

352
00:16:06,484 --> 00:16:10,260
but no matter what, communist
Russia, communist China,

353
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,145
capitalistic America, capitalistic London.

354
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:14,303
We all have our cultures,

355
00:16:14,303 --> 00:16:16,780
but there are so many things
that are tried and true human

356
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,185
no matter where you are.

357
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,450
And I trade on those things.

358
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,994
And it doesn't take you long to realize,

359
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:25,589
I had never heard the term KOL

360
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:28,741
36 hours ago.
(laughing)

361
00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:30,506
I call it influencers.
- Yeah.

362
00:16:30,506 --> 00:16:34,519
- But if you call it KOL,
then I'll call it KOL.

363
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,186
These are semantics.

364
00:16:37,587 --> 00:16:39,065
Influencer marketing is
influencer marketing,

365
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,910
I wanna remind everybody here

366
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,964
that I started a Vine agency
four months after Vine came out

367
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:47,747
that every person you know, globally,

368
00:16:47,747 --> 00:16:50,892
outside of China influencers,
I've touched or knew

369
00:16:50,892 --> 00:16:52,722
before they blew up.

370
00:16:52,722 --> 00:16:56,973
Like my contest picked Logan
Paul to be the next Vine star.

371
00:16:56,973 --> 00:16:58,853
Like I've been in this.

372
00:16:58,853 --> 00:17:02,252
I was an influencer on YouTube in 2006,

373
00:17:02,252 --> 00:17:05,403
I was an influencer on Twitter in 2007.

374
00:17:05,403 --> 00:17:06,869
These things are tried and true,

375
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:09,555
I'm very good at pattern recognition.

376
00:17:09,556 --> 00:17:11,771
I'm very good at human psychology,

377
00:17:11,771 --> 00:17:16,117
and I'm extremely good at
humility in the early stages

378
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:19,771
when you have to understand the nuances.

379
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:21,551
- Amazing, so, guys.

380
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:24,671
Because we wanna provide some value here,

381
00:17:24,672 --> 00:17:26,009
some questions.

382
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:27,910
Who has a question for Gary?

383
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,368
Is there any question?

384
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:30,451
- Yeah, here.

385
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,912
- [Man] How many hours
a night do you sleep?

386
00:17:33,912 --> 00:17:35,653
Do you track your sleep
or anything like that?

387
00:17:35,653 --> 00:17:37,479
- I don't track my sleep.

388
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:41,646
I invested in a company called
Wakemate, which was an early

389
00:17:43,344 --> 00:17:47,589
tracker technology back
in the day, like 2009.

390
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:50,393
But their first hardware like

391
00:17:50,393 --> 00:17:52,637
combusted into flames randomly

392
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:54,613
and so they went out of business.

393
00:17:54,613 --> 00:17:56,899
But that was the only time I was close

394
00:17:56,899 --> 00:17:58,361
to ever tracking my sleep.

395
00:17:58,361 --> 00:18:01,098
I sleep six hours a night.

396
00:18:01,098 --> 00:18:02,889
I try, I'll sleep more, fuck,

397
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:04,679
I wish I could sleep all
the time, to be very...

398
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:07,070
(laughing)

399
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,903
I hate

400
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:11,631
the idea that people think
that I'm against sleeping

401
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:14,416
or that sleeping is not cool.

402
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,786
Sleeping is fucking important.

403
00:18:16,786 --> 00:18:19,062
I am far more passionate
about what you're doing

404
00:18:19,062 --> 00:18:21,815
when you're awake than
I am when you sleep.

405
00:18:21,815 --> 00:18:24,006
I'm not worried if you
sleep eight hours a day,

406
00:18:24,006 --> 00:18:28,726
I'm worried that you're
fucking around the other 16.

407
00:18:28,726 --> 00:18:29,845
So

408
00:18:29,845 --> 00:18:32,522
I think the sleep conversation needs to be

409
00:18:32,522 --> 00:18:34,783
talked about more and
defined, and I've been very...

410
00:18:34,783 --> 00:18:37,342
It's a great first question.

411
00:18:37,342 --> 00:18:39,986
I'm curious, and by the
way, I'm only curious

412
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:42,108
about what you're doing 16 hours a day

413
00:18:42,108 --> 00:18:44,970
when your mouth is ahead of your actions.

414
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,319
If you're telling me you're gonna build

415
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,871
a hundred million dollar company,

416
00:18:47,871 --> 00:18:52,038
and you have any leisure, I'm
calling you out on bullshit.

417
00:18:55,423 --> 00:18:59,400
It's hard enough to build
a million dollar business.

418
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,477
You know one that's actually profitable.

419
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,977
So, I try to sleep six, seven.

420
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,755
But I get plenty of fours
and fives, they happen.

421
00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:12,338
But I'd prefer not.

422
00:19:13,242 --> 00:19:15,142
I mean, one of the biggest
reasons I think I wanna spend

423
00:19:15,142 --> 00:19:16,489
more time in Asia is

424
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,328
these fuckin' 16 hour flights,
I can get a nice 8-9-10.

425
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:21,835
(laughing)
And still get work done.

426
00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:23,084
- Yeah.
- I was like,

427
00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:25,484
this was literally the
happiest day of my year so far

428
00:19:25,484 --> 00:19:26,957
was the 16 hour flight here.

429
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,083
I hadn't been sleeping
much, 'cause of serendipity,

430
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:32,314
so I slept 10, Cathay has no WiFi,

431
00:19:32,314 --> 00:19:34,243
so I wasn't distracted and ADD'd out,

432
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:36,479
so I had 6 hours of work,
got my inbox to zero

433
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:38,573
for the first time in
five and a half months.

434
00:19:38,573 --> 00:19:40,923
I fuckin' land, fuckin' rested as shit,

435
00:19:40,923 --> 00:19:42,904
inbox zero, I'm like, fuck yeah.

436
00:19:42,904 --> 00:19:45,259
(laughing)

437
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:46,633
- 'Nother question here.

438
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:47,688
- [Man] Cool, thank you, so we know

439
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:49,272
a ton about a lot of your successes,

440
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,098
I was curious to know,
can you walk us through

441
00:19:51,098 --> 00:19:53,934
one of your biggest failures
and what you learned from that.

442
00:19:53,934 --> 00:19:55,436
- I think, you know look,

443
00:19:55,436 --> 00:19:57,168
I've only run two businesses in my life

444
00:19:57,168 --> 00:19:58,562
and they're both gonna end up being

445
00:19:58,562 --> 00:20:00,454
pretty fuckin' successful.

446
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:04,799
I think my failures are the
things that I didn't do.

447
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,463
Like, I don't think anything I operate

448
00:20:07,463 --> 00:20:11,804
is gonna fail, because I
don't have failure behavior.

449
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:13,418
I'm patient and slow,

450
00:20:13,418 --> 00:20:15,482
so I'm not overextending myself.

451
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:17,537
I'm not driven by short term capital,

452
00:20:17,537 --> 00:20:19,714
so I'm not overextending myself.

453
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:23,632
I have skill, and was
making $4,000 a weekend

454
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:25,992
when I was 12 years old
selling baseball cards.

455
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:29,857
So I'm a naturally good business salesman.

456
00:20:29,857 --> 00:20:31,649
I know how to run my shit,

457
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:33,834
I don't care about what
anybody thinks about me,

458
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:36,184
so I never do behavior that postures

459
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:38,058
ahead of what I can afford.

460
00:20:38,058 --> 00:20:41,270
So I don't have behavior
for operational failure.

461
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,700
I think my failures are
in all the opportunities

462
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,514
that I had, I'm crippled by opportunity.

463
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:49,469
Every single day I get
three to four emails

464
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:51,720
that are batshit crazy, right,

465
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,104
do this, do that.

466
00:20:53,104 --> 00:20:55,420
Take 50% of my company this,

467
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,568
become the face of this TV show,

468
00:20:57,568 --> 00:20:59,269
open this office, I'll
give you my business.

469
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:01,821
Buy this business, I'm
crippled by opportunity,

470
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:04,173
I'm saying no so much,
so many of those things

471
00:21:04,173 --> 00:21:06,997
should have been yeses, so,

472
00:21:06,997 --> 00:21:08,600
yeah, I mean, like Travis, right.

473
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,467
Travis is the only person I
reference in my first book

474
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:14,433
besides my family, yet I
pass on Uber's angel round

475
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:16,608
of four million dollar evaluation, twice,

476
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,972
my normal $25-50,000 check.

477
00:21:18,972 --> 00:21:20,393
You're talking about two to eight

478
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:23,638
hundred million dollar return.

479
00:21:23,638 --> 00:21:25,055
That's a failure.

480
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:27,578
You know, but I don't

481
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:31,534
it's crazy, right, that's
game changing, right?

482
00:21:31,534 --> 00:21:35,160
I don't know your psyche,
but saying no twice

483
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,308
in a time when you were
saying yes to a ton of shit,

484
00:21:37,308 --> 00:21:40,426
and you said no to one of
your best friends, twice,

485
00:21:40,426 --> 00:21:42,438
and it turned out to be one
of the biggest companies

486
00:21:42,438 --> 00:21:43,438
of all time,

487
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:46,880
I mean, I dunno, maybe it's like

488
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,906
I might have pulled off one
of the biggest failures ever.

489
00:21:48,906 --> 00:21:50,129
(laughing)

490
00:21:50,129 --> 00:21:52,467
I just don't even think about it that way,

491
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:55,599
it's just the cost of entry,
it's part of the sport.

492
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,791
I don't dwell on it.

493
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,431
I probably have so many more failures,

494
00:21:59,431 --> 00:22:02,183
I'm just incapable of synthesizing them.

495
00:22:02,183 --> 00:22:04,030
The level of disrespect
I have for my failures

496
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,664
is overwhelming, I believe
way too many people here

497
00:22:06,664 --> 00:22:08,684
respect the shit out of their failures.

498
00:22:08,684 --> 00:22:10,267
Fuck your failures.

499
00:22:11,252 --> 00:22:13,976
Everybody else is judging your failures.

500
00:22:13,976 --> 00:22:16,309
(chuckling)

501
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,660
- Is there any way that
you can train this?

502
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,574
Like that you don't
care about your failures

503
00:22:20,574 --> 00:22:22,535
and that you let somebody down?

504
00:22:22,535 --> 00:22:24,909
- I think it's predicated on self esteem

505
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:28,829
and genuine love for what you're doing

506
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:31,144
and so I don't know if that's teachable.

507
00:22:31,144 --> 00:22:33,109
But I do think there's a framework.

508
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:35,931
If you asked me why my
answer was just that,

509
00:22:35,931 --> 00:22:39,347
it's that I love losing
as much as I love winning,

510
00:22:39,347 --> 00:22:41,415
because I love the game.

511
00:22:41,415 --> 00:22:43,689
And they both are equally, like Uber,

512
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:45,521
I think you've got a read on this.

513
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:47,579
Like, I love it, so I talk about it.

514
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:49,888
- Yeah.
- I love it.

515
00:22:49,888 --> 00:22:51,388
I fuckin' love it.

516
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,619
And so I think that's one,

517
00:22:56,619 --> 00:22:57,845
and then I think self esteem.

518
00:22:57,845 --> 00:23:01,101
I'm confident in a macro
that I'll make it up.

519
00:23:01,101 --> 00:23:04,550
My vulnerability is being
very bitter in my elder years

520
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,520
when I don't have as much time.

521
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,249
I'm so happy to be doing
this that when I know

522
00:23:10,249 --> 00:23:12,539
that I get to do this
for another 45 years,

523
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:15,333
it's hard for me to be upset
about something that happened

524
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:18,192
five minutes ago, or last
year, or seven years ago.

525
00:23:18,192 --> 00:23:22,359
What I'm worried about, my
kryptonite is being 83, 87

526
00:23:23,307 --> 00:23:26,868
and knowing there's just
not 20 years to go, right?

527
00:23:26,868 --> 00:23:31,077
And so that will be
something that I worry about.

528
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:34,674
To be very frank with you,
I'm optimistic that I'll

529
00:23:34,674 --> 00:23:39,404
sell myself on some other
fruits, grandchildren,

530
00:23:39,404 --> 00:23:42,903
who knows what, but it is
something that I think about.

531
00:23:42,903 --> 00:23:47,070
Which is, I'm just so
optimistic, and it's predicated

532
00:23:48,191 --> 00:23:51,162
on just more time and time will go away.

533
00:23:51,162 --> 00:23:53,743
- You are, because this morning, we had

534
00:23:53,743 --> 00:23:55,575
a little bit of mix up in the morning

535
00:23:55,575 --> 00:23:59,424
and I was kind of upset, you know, because

536
00:23:59,424 --> 00:24:02,240
you're a busy guy and I thought,
like, I'm wasting your time

537
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,458
if I'm not going to
deliver exactly the thing

538
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,438
that we agreed on, but you told me like,

539
00:24:06,438 --> 00:24:09,229
no, you didn't waste my time

540
00:24:09,229 --> 00:24:10,903
and we talked about some different stuff.

541
00:24:10,903 --> 00:24:13,024
But like, for me it was
like that experience

542
00:24:13,024 --> 00:24:16,717
that I cared so much about you
and not letting you down...

543
00:24:16,717 --> 00:24:21,317
- So look, I think money
and success expose people.

544
00:24:21,317 --> 00:24:23,663
I don't think it changes them.

545
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:24,854
So

546
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:27,856
yeah, you had some other
people that were supposed

547
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:29,675
to join our meeting this morning,

548
00:24:29,675 --> 00:24:32,488
they didn't show up, I don't think my time

549
00:24:32,488 --> 00:24:35,488
is so much more valuable than yours.

550
00:24:36,762 --> 00:24:37,845
I just don't.

551
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:41,077
So I did what I believe in the most,

552
00:24:41,077 --> 00:24:44,413
which is I adjusted to the situation.

553
00:24:44,413 --> 00:24:48,200
'Cause people didn't show up
and we did some other shit.

554
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,170
(laughing)

555
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,071
You know, like I just think
the people that would make

556
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:53,869
you feel bad about that, and by the way,

557
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:55,630
plenty of important, big
people make you feel bad

558
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,064
about that.

559
00:24:57,064 --> 00:24:59,647
I just think they're fuckfaces.

560
00:25:01,014 --> 00:25:03,077
You know.
- I love you.

561
00:25:03,077 --> 00:25:06,865
- I just think they're imposing
their insecurities on you,

562
00:25:06,865 --> 00:25:09,014
when they make you feel bad about that.

563
00:25:09,014 --> 00:25:10,935
- Awesome, you have a question here.

564
00:25:10,935 --> 00:25:12,685
And then.
- Hey, Gary.

565
00:25:14,352 --> 00:25:16,202
- Come here, come here.
- Name tag.

566
00:25:16,202 --> 00:25:17,179
- [Woman] Name tag.

567
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:18,555
- I'm not that good.

568
00:25:18,555 --> 00:25:20,006
Hello, Madison.

569
00:25:20,006 --> 00:25:21,579
- Thank you for coming to Hong
Kong and sharing your time

570
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:23,240
with us, great to have you.

571
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,396
You touched a little bit on intelligence,

572
00:25:25,396 --> 00:25:27,731
of course it's not what
you really wanna focus on,

573
00:25:27,731 --> 00:25:30,502
evangelizing work ethic and hustle.

574
00:25:30,502 --> 00:25:33,692
But what about purpose,
because you found the trifecta

575
00:25:33,692 --> 00:25:36,861
of harnessing your
intelligence, doing the grind,

576
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:39,955
but for people that are still
trying to find that purpose,

577
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,463
so that it's really mission oriented,

578
00:25:41,463 --> 00:25:44,797
so they can sustain themselves,
what can you tell us

579
00:25:44,797 --> 00:25:46,441
about finding your purpose.

580
00:25:46,441 --> 00:25:50,626
- I think you need to try to
go insular and taste things.

581
00:25:50,626 --> 00:25:53,793
Purpose is a fancy word for happiness.

582
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,368
I think if you break it down,

583
00:25:56,368 --> 00:25:59,951
purpose, what's my purpose, what's my why?

584
00:25:59,951 --> 00:26:03,495
My homie Simon, right,
yeah, it's semantics.

585
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:04,495
Like for me,

586
00:26:07,815 --> 00:26:10,797
I can't stress enough, you have to, again,

587
00:26:10,797 --> 00:26:12,162
and I'm gonna keep hounding this,

588
00:26:12,162 --> 00:26:13,685
'cause I need you to understand.

589
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:15,879
When I was five, I thought it was,

590
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:17,924
when I was seven, when I was nine,

591
00:26:17,924 --> 00:26:20,561
on a summer day, I'm a kid of the 80s,

592
00:26:20,561 --> 00:26:22,747
in America, which means you
went outside and you played,

593
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,271
right?

594
00:26:24,271 --> 00:26:28,438
I thought it was more fun
to convince, manipulate,

595
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:34,247
whatever semantic word
you wanna use, my friends

596
00:26:34,247 --> 00:26:36,588
into standing behind lemonade stands

597
00:26:36,588 --> 00:26:40,095
or ringing people's doorbells
and washing their cars.

598
00:26:40,095 --> 00:26:42,678
Like, it's my true love, right?

599
00:26:44,373 --> 00:26:47,840
And I don't think most
people want to follow

600
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,734
their true love, 'cause a, my true love

601
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:54,172
was building a business that makes money.

602
00:26:54,172 --> 00:26:56,895
Which is very practical.

603
00:26:56,895 --> 00:26:59,003
I think if somebody's true love is music,

604
00:26:59,003 --> 00:27:02,187
they haven't figured out
how to make it monetizable

605
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,279
because they have friction.

606
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:07,249
'Cause their true love is something

607
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:09,332
but they also want money.

608
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:11,064
And stuff,

609
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:14,621
and I think that people waver.

610
00:27:15,648 --> 00:27:18,027
I think people struggle to find purpose

611
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:21,065
because they overvalue things

612
00:27:21,065 --> 00:27:25,232
and people's opinions over
their own true happiness.

613
00:27:26,642 --> 00:27:28,546
It's as basic as it gets.

614
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:32,129
So I think that people,
I think everybody here

615
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:36,154
if I told them, everything
is gonna be okay,

616
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,751
you can have everything you want.

617
00:27:37,751 --> 00:27:39,820
Now, what are you gonna do with your day?

618
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,687
I think a lot of people know.

619
00:27:42,687 --> 00:27:44,301
It could be anything.

620
00:27:44,301 --> 00:27:48,011
If you were to then watch movies all day,

621
00:27:48,011 --> 00:27:50,407
if we played this game,
and you're like okay,

622
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:51,650
everything?

623
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:52,841
Well, fuck, I don't wanna do shit,

624
00:27:52,841 --> 00:27:54,047
I just wanna watch movies.

625
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:57,816
Cool, I think you should
build a business around that.

626
00:27:57,816 --> 00:28:00,443
Like to me, great, right?

627
00:28:00,443 --> 00:28:02,860
So I think people are scared.

628
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:06,199
I think people are scared,

629
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:07,965
I think they're scared
what people will think,

630
00:28:07,965 --> 00:28:10,166
and I think they're scared
that they can't survive

631
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:12,055
living the life that they wanna live

632
00:28:12,055 --> 00:28:14,331
from a materialistic standpoint.

633
00:28:14,331 --> 00:28:19,238
What makes me so dangerous,
is I don't need anything.

634
00:28:19,238 --> 00:28:21,903
I don't need anything,
I don't need anybody,

635
00:28:21,903 --> 00:28:24,000
and that's it, and so I'm good.

636
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,946
And I wish that on everybody.

637
00:28:26,946 --> 00:28:28,638
You know how nice it is
to not rely on anybody

638
00:28:28,638 --> 00:28:31,629
for anything at all ever, not emotionally,

639
00:28:31,629 --> 00:28:34,962
not financially, it's just the Zen zone.

640
00:28:36,107 --> 00:28:39,274
But purpose is to make yourself happy.

641
00:28:40,163 --> 00:28:44,100
I'm a nice guy, 'cause I like admiration.

642
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,482
And so I have to give it.

643
00:28:46,482 --> 00:28:48,192
That's my purpose, but it's all predicated

644
00:28:48,192 --> 00:28:49,329
on making me happy.

645
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:50,570
I'm nice

646
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,733
because it makes me feel good

647
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:54,591
what they say about me.

648
00:28:54,591 --> 00:28:57,579
Like, you have to
understand, it's very basic.

649
00:28:57,579 --> 00:28:58,808
And so,

650
00:28:58,808 --> 00:29:00,616
yeah, I think people are scared.

651
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:04,541
I, listen, if I could ever convince you

652
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:09,406
that you don't need shit, you
would be off to the races.

653
00:29:09,406 --> 00:29:11,949
If you could unmaterialistic yourself,

654
00:29:11,949 --> 00:29:14,699
you'd be fucking, fuck, you know?

655
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:21,207
- Over there, little girl.

656
00:29:21,207 --> 00:29:23,822
- I've been working on a startup myself

657
00:29:23,822 --> 00:29:26,232
and despite everyone being really nice,

658
00:29:26,232 --> 00:29:28,513
I've always noticed that
there's sort of like,

659
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:29,863
you're a bit too young to do this.

660
00:29:29,863 --> 00:29:33,706
How do you get past the
stereotypes or limitations?

661
00:29:33,706 --> 00:29:35,877
- I think you know the answer, Hillary,

662
00:29:35,877 --> 00:29:37,682
I think it's in your own head, right?

663
00:29:37,682 --> 00:29:41,765
Like, the bottom line is,
do you agree with that?

664
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:45,376
Great, you're on your fuckin' way.

665
00:29:45,376 --> 00:29:46,376
Right, like,

666
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,451
listen, is your mom here?

667
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:53,284
There she is, like,
you've already won, right.

668
00:29:54,172 --> 00:29:56,618
Your question, do you wanna hear

669
00:29:56,618 --> 00:29:57,857
something interesting, Hillary?

670
00:29:57,857 --> 00:29:59,811
I don't think you even
believe in the question

671
00:29:59,811 --> 00:30:01,477
that you just asked me.

672
00:30:01,477 --> 00:30:03,386
And that is the ultimate compliment,

673
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:05,152
because spending time with
you backstage yesterday,

674
00:30:05,152 --> 00:30:07,744
like, I think that's a cute question,

675
00:30:07,744 --> 00:30:10,184
but I actually don't
think you give a shit.

676
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:12,012
(chuckling)

677
00:30:12,012 --> 00:30:14,387
Do you give a shit
about what people think.

678
00:30:14,387 --> 00:30:15,613
- Occasionally.

679
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,053
- Right.

680
00:30:17,053 --> 00:30:18,633
I respect that.

681
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:20,448
(laughing)

682
00:30:20,448 --> 00:30:23,897
Hillary,
(applause)

683
00:30:23,897 --> 00:30:26,029
I'm gonna tell you
something really exciting,

684
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:27,108
you're 12, right?

685
00:30:27,108 --> 00:30:28,098
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so

686
00:30:28,098 --> 00:30:30,178
I'm gonna tell you
something super exciting.

687
00:30:30,178 --> 00:30:33,755
When I was 12, I occasionally
cared what people thought too.

688
00:30:33,755 --> 00:30:35,367
that shit goes away real quick.

689
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,708
(laughing)

690
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:40,016
That's the answer, like, what.

691
00:30:40,016 --> 00:30:41,330
Like, what?

692
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:44,877
Your teacher or your
uncle Rick fuckin' thinks

693
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,455
that you're too early?

694
00:30:46,455 --> 00:30:48,681
Like, it's just not gonna
matter at the end, Hillary.

695
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,040
Here's what's gonna happen,

696
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,321
either you're right or they're right.

697
00:30:53,321 --> 00:30:55,222
That's what's gonna happen at the end.

698
00:30:55,222 --> 00:30:58,837
Spending any time debating
who's cheering for what outcome

699
00:30:58,837 --> 00:31:03,004
or what point of view is a
complete waste of your energy.

700
00:31:04,336 --> 00:31:07,873
- So we have maybe, we have
time for like two more,

701
00:31:07,873 --> 00:31:09,768
quick ones, so.

702
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:12,048
- So we have 30 on the back
end for books, like that?

703
00:31:12,048 --> 00:31:14,330
- Yeah, because we have...
- Let's do 20 of that,

704
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,984
let's do a little more questions,
'cause it's more valuable.

705
00:31:15,984 --> 00:31:17,147
- Cool, cool, so we have more.

706
00:31:17,147 --> 00:31:18,490
- Okay.
- Please.

707
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,570
- [Mac] Hi, Gary, Mac.

708
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,582
- And we have to go to the back, right?

709
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:22,165
Like people at back, you
wanna ask a question, right?

710
00:31:22,165 --> 00:31:25,249
(whoop)
- Just raise your hand.

711
00:31:25,249 --> 00:31:26,899
- [Mac] Hi, Gary, this is Mac.

712
00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:30,950
I have a question, you
exactly Silicon Valley

713
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:35,116
and then values and the
businesses, people over there.

714
00:31:35,116 --> 00:31:38,148
Hong Kong, Singapore, a
lot of places in China

715
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:43,142
want to kind of copy, this
kind of values, standards.

716
00:31:43,142 --> 00:31:47,309
What they are, and how we can
learn from this place of that.

717
00:31:50,392 --> 00:31:51,685
- So,

718
00:31:51,685 --> 00:31:54,768
that would make me really sad if Asia

719
00:31:55,878 --> 00:31:58,324
started replicating
Silicon Valley standards.

720
00:31:58,324 --> 00:32:00,032
(cheering)
You know.

721
00:32:00,032 --> 00:32:02,650
Well, first of all, if
you look at, for example,

722
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:05,592
the Chinese social network
ecosystem and platforms,

723
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:08,460
they, because of the payment integration,

724
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,365
have much better business models.

725
00:32:11,365 --> 00:32:14,628
Silicon Valley, bless you, Silicon Valley

726
00:32:14,628 --> 00:32:17,290
(chuckling)
Silicon Valley

727
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,957
VC, let me rephrase.

728
00:32:19,824 --> 00:32:22,444
It's not Silicon Valley when
people say Silicon Valley,

729
00:32:22,444 --> 00:32:25,173
what we're referring
to is venture capital.

730
00:32:25,173 --> 00:32:28,070
The venture capital
model is very practical.

731
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,794
Stress all your companies
to be nonpractical

732
00:32:31,794 --> 00:32:36,171
so that one gets through
and makes your fund return

733
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:38,171
on it's nonpracticality.

734
00:32:39,098 --> 00:32:42,069
All that's happened in
the last seven years

735
00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:44,381
of putting venture capital

736
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:47,028
business mindset to the forefront,

737
00:32:47,028 --> 00:32:51,406
is we've taught a lot of
people to not be entrepreneurs.

738
00:32:51,406 --> 00:32:54,179
We've taught a lot of
people of how to worship

739
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:57,353
fundraising, not business building.

740
00:32:57,353 --> 00:32:59,447
The number one mistake Asia would make

741
00:32:59,447 --> 00:33:03,286
is to follow the Silicon Valley blueprint.

742
00:33:03,286 --> 00:33:04,536
That's it, man.

743
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:09,576
If you're talking about innovation,

744
00:33:09,576 --> 00:33:11,519
like innovation will always matter,

745
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,992
but innovation happens all over the world.

746
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:15,957
Silicon Valley is just where kids go

747
00:33:15,957 --> 00:33:17,957
after good shit happens.

748
00:33:19,876 --> 00:33:23,562
Like, Facebook was invented in Boston.

749
00:33:23,562 --> 00:33:26,812
Pinterest was invented in Pennsylvania.

750
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:35,418
This is that same bullshit
that universities trade on.

751
00:33:35,418 --> 00:33:38,001
Silicon Valley trades on brand.

752
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,330
Harvard trades on brand.

753
00:33:42,536 --> 00:33:45,854
These things are not as
valuable as we think.

754
00:33:45,854 --> 00:33:47,746
We're worshiping the wrong thing.

755
00:33:47,746 --> 00:33:50,789
So how can you improve on it,
what can you take out of it,

756
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:53,448
look, I think the entrepreneurial spirit

757
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,894
is very alive and well in Asia,

758
00:33:55,894 --> 00:33:58,501
I think it's, unlike
other parts of the world,

759
00:33:58,501 --> 00:34:01,110
it is a religion here,
just like it is in America,

760
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:04,395
so I think that's the cost
of entry, it's optimism.

761
00:34:04,395 --> 00:34:09,009
It's where failure isn't
the deathblow in society,

762
00:34:09,009 --> 00:34:11,362
it may hurt, but it's not a deathblow.

763
00:34:11,362 --> 00:34:14,446
Really tough to fail at
an entrepreneurial venture

764
00:34:14,446 --> 00:34:17,188
in Western Europe, really tough.

765
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,438
So I think that

766
00:34:19,501 --> 00:34:22,251
spending any time, you know, even

767
00:34:24,364 --> 00:34:26,588
my best advice for Asia
is to not pay attention

768
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:28,089
to America at all.

769
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:33,627
- Nother question, somewhere?

770
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:34,629
You have mic, right?

771
00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:35,908
- [Shin] Hi, Gary, my name's Shin.

772
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:38,531
- Hi Shin.
- My question is

773
00:34:38,531 --> 00:34:40,768
with so many opportunities
coming your way,

774
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,849
how do you decide the
people you want to work with

775
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:46,090
and collaborate with?
- Intuition.

776
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:49,416
(chuckling from audience)

777
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:51,485
(applause)

778
00:34:51,485 --> 00:34:54,578
And Shin, to be honest with
you, what a shit answer, right?

779
00:34:54,578 --> 00:34:57,264
Because it brings no value to anybody here

780
00:34:57,264 --> 00:34:59,872
other than I just have
to tell you the truth.

781
00:34:59,872 --> 00:35:00,789
It's, fuck.

782
00:35:03,175 --> 00:35:05,818
It's what I go on, you know?

783
00:35:05,818 --> 00:35:08,985
It's because I'm willing to fire fast.

784
00:35:09,885 --> 00:35:14,153
People have their ego tied
up into hiring, it's insane.

785
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,773
Hiring is such a subtle thing.

786
00:35:15,773 --> 00:35:19,154
Partnerships, hiring, and
investing, such a subtle thing.

787
00:35:19,154 --> 00:35:23,011
People love to be romantic about
their judgment in character

788
00:35:23,011 --> 00:35:27,178
thus, it deems them nonactionable
when it most matters.

789
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:31,177
Guys, humility is the game.

790
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,121
I've got plenty of bravado and peacocking,

791
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:36,979
I understand why it might
be hard to see my humility.

792
00:35:36,979 --> 00:35:39,312
But humility is my strength.

793
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:43,900
I intuitively think that person's awesome,

794
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,289
I get to hang out with them for a week,

795
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:49,143
I realize they're an
idiot, I need to move.

796
00:35:49,143 --> 00:35:51,053
Most people disguise it

797
00:35:51,053 --> 00:35:53,075
so that people didn't think
they made the call wrong

798
00:35:53,075 --> 00:35:54,658
in the first place.

799
00:35:57,273 --> 00:35:58,293
- Cool, is there any other question?

800
00:35:58,293 --> 00:35:59,426
- [Woman] I have a question.

801
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:00,259
- Okay.

802
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:02,320
- [Woman] Sorry, thank you so
much, Gary, for being here.

803
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,434
What is the one question
that no one is asking,

804
00:36:05,434 --> 00:36:08,015
but that everyone should
be, in your opinion.

805
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:09,498
- God, this has been such a tough question

806
00:36:09,498 --> 00:36:13,248
when it's come up.
(laughing)

807
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:16,648
It really is, this is one
of the toughest questions.

808
00:36:16,648 --> 00:36:19,250
To really answer your question properly,

809
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,081
the question they should be asking

810
00:36:21,081 --> 00:36:25,248
is the thing that they're
most scared to say out loud.

811
00:36:26,205 --> 00:36:27,831
The question they should be asking is

812
00:36:27,831 --> 00:36:29,998
hey, Gary, it's Shin here.

813
00:36:31,592 --> 00:36:35,759
So my dad is insecure, and
thus, it's manifested in a way

814
00:36:36,681 --> 00:36:38,857
where he's making me do this.

815
00:36:38,857 --> 00:36:42,092
I love my dad, but I don't wanna do this.

816
00:36:42,092 --> 00:36:44,316
And it's causing real
friction in my household.

817
00:36:44,316 --> 00:36:45,847
And my mom is of a generation

818
00:36:45,847 --> 00:36:47,573
that she blindly listens to my dad

819
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:50,771
and this feels very
toxic, what should I do?

820
00:36:50,771 --> 00:36:52,747
That's the question,
and every other question

821
00:36:52,747 --> 00:36:54,830
that looks like it, right?

822
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,309
The question that should be asked

823
00:36:56,309 --> 00:36:58,399
is the one that nobody
wants to say out loud

824
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:00,399
because it exposes them.

825
00:37:03,403 --> 00:37:05,004
- Over there, in the back.

826
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:05,973
- [Man] Hello, Gary.

827
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,011
- Hey.
- How are you?

828
00:37:07,011 --> 00:37:08,659
- Very well.
- I'm from China.

829
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:09,683
- Good.
- Actually with

830
00:37:09,683 --> 00:37:12,084
your Chinese translation team here.

831
00:37:12,084 --> 00:37:15,751
So my question is about
the retail business.

832
00:37:17,924 --> 00:37:19,351
- Retail.
- Yeah.

833
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:22,458
So for the past 10 days
there has been a article

834
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:25,458
in the WeChat, it's been reposted by

835
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:31,103
2,800 accounts and read
one hundred million times.

836
00:37:32,086 --> 00:37:35,035
- Small numbers by China's standards.

837
00:37:35,035 --> 00:37:37,232
- I'm kidding, go ahead.
- It's kinda big

838
00:37:37,232 --> 00:37:39,216
on the WeChat though.
- Yeah, go ahead.

839
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:42,561
- By the way, I really wish
it was one of your articles,

840
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:43,894
we'll see, okay.

841
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:49,895
It's about the new supermarket
that has recently opened,

842
00:37:51,856 --> 00:37:53,894
there's no human being on it.

843
00:37:53,894 --> 00:37:55,069
- [Gary] There's no human beings in it?

844
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:58,166
- Yeah, you just went in
and grab the bread out

845
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:01,523
and went out and the payment
would be deducted from your

846
00:38:01,523 --> 00:38:02,481
already paid account.

847
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:04,064
- Phenomenal.
- Yeah.

848
00:38:04,064 --> 00:38:05,415
- [Gary] I can literally not wait

849
00:38:05,415 --> 00:38:07,170
for the robots to kill all of us.

850
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,391
(laughing)

851
00:38:08,391 --> 00:38:09,280
- Okay, okay.

852
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,869
Sounds good.

853
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:11,702
So,

854
00:38:13,508 --> 00:38:17,175
the online giants are
going back to offline.

855
00:38:19,837 --> 00:38:24,465
The similar case would be
Amazon opened their first

856
00:38:24,465 --> 00:38:27,632
physical store back in 2015 in Seattle

857
00:38:28,712 --> 00:38:33,499
and a few weeks ago, Amazon
just bought Whole Foods, yeah.

858
00:38:33,499 --> 00:38:36,717
So the giants, the online giants,

859
00:38:36,717 --> 00:38:40,140
they have all the money
and resources to do that.

860
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,307
- That's good.

861
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:45,015
- Yeah, it's good, my question is...

862
00:38:45,015 --> 00:38:47,563
- You know how this all plays out, right?

863
00:38:47,563 --> 00:38:49,184
- Yeah.

864
00:38:49,184 --> 00:38:51,524
- You know, consolidation
and then fragmentation,

865
00:38:51,524 --> 00:38:52,915
consolidation and then fragmentation.

866
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:55,381
- So it's going to be the next generation

867
00:38:55,381 --> 00:38:57,535
of retail business?
- Of course.

868
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,917
- My man, what always happens
in the history of time,

869
00:39:00,917 --> 00:39:04,167
of capitalism, is once in a generation,

870
00:39:05,057 --> 00:39:07,828
entrepreneurs come and
gobble up the landscape

871
00:39:07,828 --> 00:39:11,182
and become the legendary
figures of their generation.

872
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,510
And then they either get fat and slow

873
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,415
and young companies find angles within it,

874
00:39:17,415 --> 00:39:19,777
or they die and then different people come

875
00:39:19,777 --> 00:39:22,512
and run the company that suck.

876
00:39:22,512 --> 00:39:23,541
But like,

877
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,962
these are just cycles.

878
00:39:25,962 --> 00:39:29,446
We had a new frontier, it
was called the internet.

879
00:39:29,446 --> 00:39:31,155
It changed everything.

880
00:39:31,155 --> 00:39:33,111
It's still very young.

881
00:39:33,111 --> 00:39:36,328
Pioneers landgrabbed
the same way that people

882
00:39:36,328 --> 00:39:38,875
bought up property thousands of years ago,

883
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:41,466
hundreds of years ago, right?

884
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:45,570
And the Mas and the Bezoses,
they become these iconic people

885
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:49,643
then they either die, or
stop running the companies.

886
00:39:49,643 --> 00:39:51,749
And then youngsters
see the vulnerabilities

887
00:39:51,749 --> 00:39:53,299
in the new thing.

888
00:39:53,299 --> 00:39:54,708
Do you understand that in 20 years,

889
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:56,433
there'll be virtual reality and then

890
00:39:56,433 --> 00:39:57,498
every piece of infrastructure

891
00:39:57,498 --> 00:40:00,613
in our physical and internet
world will become vulnerable

892
00:40:00,613 --> 00:40:02,781
and there'll be new people that landgrab

893
00:40:02,781 --> 00:40:06,823
and the new Mas and the Bezoses, Karen Ma

894
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:09,565
is gonna start a virtual
world where she owns

895
00:40:09,565 --> 00:40:12,162
all of the retail world,
because everything now becomes

896
00:40:12,162 --> 00:40:14,746
virtual, because that's how we communicate

897
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,663
in an augmented world and so, cool.

898
00:40:19,903 --> 00:40:22,181
Great, I'm glad I don't have
to take out my fuckin' wallet

899
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:25,578
going to fucking the store.
- Yeah, totally.

900
00:40:25,578 --> 00:40:27,314
- So what's the question?

901
00:40:27,314 --> 00:40:30,358
(laughing)

902
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:32,240
So, as the change is coming,

903
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,981
what's the potential
strain and opportunity

904
00:40:34,981 --> 00:40:37,981
for the individual online retailers?

905
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,966
- The littler ones?
- The individual, like

906
00:40:41,966 --> 00:40:44,042
you encourage people to
stay out of things on Ebay,

907
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:47,293
so there's a lot of...
- There's unlimited.

908
00:40:47,293 --> 00:40:51,276
My man, how much do you
think Amazon and Alibaba

909
00:40:51,276 --> 00:40:54,401
and everybody else, what
percentage of every transaction

910
00:40:54,401 --> 00:40:58,902
in the world do you think
they'll ultimately own?

911
00:40:58,902 --> 00:41:00,214
- [Man] I have no fucking idea.

912
00:41:00,214 --> 00:41:02,934
- No problem.
(laughing)

913
00:41:02,934 --> 00:41:04,613
Let me give you an answer,

914
00:41:04,613 --> 00:41:06,920
not enough to allow trillions of people

915
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,496
to make tons of money.

916
00:41:09,496 --> 00:41:12,624
- [Man] Yeah, sure, makes sense.

917
00:41:12,624 --> 00:41:13,963
- The end.
- Thanks.

918
00:41:13,963 --> 00:41:15,884
- You're welcome.

919
00:41:15,884 --> 00:41:18,456
(applause)

920
00:41:18,456 --> 00:41:21,188
- I guess, we have really,
we have time for one

921
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:23,055
more and then we need to move on.

922
00:41:23,055 --> 00:41:24,416
Because you have other meetings.

923
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:26,834
- Okay.
- So one more, guys.

924
00:41:26,834 --> 00:41:29,901
- Hi, Gary, I'm Mint from (inaudible)

925
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:31,654
and I have a question,

926
00:41:31,654 --> 00:41:34,304
it's like the question you just mentioned.

927
00:41:34,304 --> 00:41:37,820
I'm a young entrepreneur,
but I'm now in a stage

928
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,016
that I want to catch every
opportunity in front of me

929
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:45,122
and everything's important,
everything has a big benefit

930
00:41:45,122 --> 00:41:48,953
to my life, so do you
have any suggestions of

931
00:41:48,953 --> 00:41:52,102
how I choose this thing, 'cause every day

932
00:41:52,102 --> 00:41:56,047
I sleep only four hours
to solve everything

933
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:57,624
that's really a problem.

934
00:41:57,624 --> 00:42:00,668
- I think the answer is
to not judge yourself.

935
00:42:00,668 --> 00:42:02,538
- Not judge myself?

936
00:42:02,538 --> 00:42:04,177
- That's right.

937
00:42:04,177 --> 00:42:06,934
So you're deploying 20
hours of taking advantage

938
00:42:06,934 --> 00:42:09,230
of all these opportunities, right?

939
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,837
- Yeah.
- The reason you asked me

940
00:42:10,837 --> 00:42:12,760
that question, is you're laying a bed

941
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,129
right before you go to
sleep for your four hours

942
00:42:15,129 --> 00:42:17,797
and you're questioning yourself
if you did the right things

943
00:42:17,797 --> 00:42:20,343
with those 20 hours,
instead of the other things

944
00:42:20,343 --> 00:42:21,800
you could've done, right?

945
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,967
- Mm-hmm.
- So you're judging yourself.

946
00:42:27,701 --> 00:42:30,034
- Okay.
- So the punchline

947
00:42:30,034 --> 00:42:32,762
to that question and answer is this,

948
00:42:32,762 --> 00:42:36,258
you will never be able to do everything.

949
00:42:36,258 --> 00:42:39,397
You're such a fortunate young woman,

950
00:42:39,397 --> 00:42:42,779
you're crippled by opportunity.

951
00:42:42,779 --> 00:42:46,193
So just do as much shit as
you can in your 20 hours,

952
00:42:46,193 --> 00:42:48,284
and then wake up the next
morning and do it again,

953
00:42:48,284 --> 00:42:50,406
but never think about it ever again.

954
00:42:50,406 --> 00:42:51,491
- [Woman] Okay, sure, thanks.

955
00:42:51,491 --> 00:42:53,741
(cheering)

956
00:42:54,576 --> 00:42:58,076
- So, 10 seconds, 10
seconds, 10 second question

957
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,320
you have over there, you were, yeah.

958
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,596
- Yes, awesome.

959
00:43:00,596 --> 00:43:02,931
- [Adrian] I dunno if this is
gonna be quick, I'm Adrian.

960
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:04,175
- Hi, Adrian.
- Hi, Gary.

961
00:43:04,175 --> 00:43:07,299
So taking a slightly different turn,

962
00:43:07,299 --> 00:43:09,941
with all the entrepreneurial
stuff that you do,

963
00:43:09,941 --> 00:43:12,286
what's the biggest tip
you have with dealing

964
00:43:12,286 --> 00:43:16,286
with your wife and what
do you not compromise on

965
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,650
with your kids?

966
00:43:20,091 --> 00:43:22,547
- So two things, with my wife,

967
00:43:22,547 --> 00:43:24,638
and with any relationship you have,

968
00:43:24,638 --> 00:43:26,800
you first have to make yourself happy.

969
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,577
Because if you're not happy,

970
00:43:28,577 --> 00:43:32,510
you have vulnerability
to the entire ecosystem.

971
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:33,878
So

972
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:37,095
this is something that is
super politically incorrect.

973
00:43:37,095 --> 00:43:40,113
This is not the answer that
most people hear or want,

974
00:43:40,113 --> 00:43:43,205
but I'm selfish which
allows me to be selfless.

975
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:44,558
How do I handle it with my wife?

976
00:43:44,558 --> 00:43:47,157
I overcommunicate with
her and keep checking in

977
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:48,640
and we talk about it all the time

978
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,175
as our lives evolve,
what is nonnegotiable.

979
00:43:52,175 --> 00:43:53,831
What is, what isn't?

980
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,853
I, in the last three, four years

981
00:43:55,853 --> 00:43:58,336
am spending more time
with my family not less.

982
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:00,483
It doesn't feel that
way because of the way

983
00:44:00,483 --> 00:44:02,534
I'm doing content and distribution.

984
00:44:02,534 --> 00:44:05,230
But I am, and then it's compounded,

985
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,701
because one of the lines in the sand

986
00:44:06,701 --> 00:44:09,221
is we don't show our family to the world.

987
00:44:09,221 --> 00:44:11,439
So you don't see content about my two kids

988
00:44:11,439 --> 00:44:12,924
or my wife ever.

989
00:44:12,924 --> 00:44:16,360
The most searched term
besides me, Gary Vaynerchuk,

990
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,123
is Gary Vaynerchuk
wife, because, you know.

991
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:22,281
Followed very closely by
Gary Vaynerchuk net worth.

992
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:24,531
(laughing)

993
00:44:26,661 --> 00:44:30,457
So I just communicate, and
my hope is that I create

994
00:44:30,457 --> 00:44:32,615
a framework that makes
her feel comfortable

995
00:44:32,615 --> 00:44:34,133
to communicate things, too.

996
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:37,515
That she wants to say that
I may not wanna hear, right?

997
00:44:37,515 --> 00:44:39,666
The nonnegotiable things with my kids,

998
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:43,486
is if I am in New York City
and they have a function,

999
00:44:43,486 --> 00:44:45,458
I will not miss it.

1000
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:48,661
So there is no meeting, there's
no CEO, no famous person,

1001
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:51,421
no business opportunity that will trump

1002
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:55,004
a recital or a play if
I'm in New York, but

1003
00:44:56,036 --> 00:44:58,915
I miss things all the time,
'cause I'm not in New York.

1004
00:44:58,915 --> 00:45:00,998
And I don't judge myself.

1005
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:04,242
So I do the best I can and

1006
00:45:05,404 --> 00:45:08,688
I think the political
correctness of parenting

1007
00:45:08,688 --> 00:45:12,293
and work-life balance right
now is a very hot topic,

1008
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:15,413
and I try not to talk about it too much,

1009
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:17,286
because we all have
different relationships

1010
00:45:17,286 --> 00:45:18,980
and different situations.

1011
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,618
Nobody knows what's going on in my bedroom

1012
00:45:20,618 --> 00:45:22,384
and I don't know what's going on in yours.

1013
00:45:22,384 --> 00:45:24,137
I think it's about communication

1014
00:45:24,137 --> 00:45:26,211
with the only people that matter.

1015
00:45:26,211 --> 00:45:28,876
You can judge my work-life
balance from afar,

1016
00:45:28,876 --> 00:45:30,612
I just don't give a fuck.

1017
00:45:30,612 --> 00:45:34,849
But I really care what
my wife thinks, right?

1018
00:45:34,849 --> 00:45:35,710
Communication.

1019
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:36,837
- Awesome.

1020
00:45:36,837 --> 00:45:38,070
We don't have enough time.

1021
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,106
- Thank you guys.
- We could be jamming

1022
00:45:39,106 --> 00:45:41,054
for like 15 hours.

1023
00:45:41,054 --> 00:45:45,194
So before we go, guys,
if you have the books,

1024
00:45:45,194 --> 00:45:46,737
those who have bought books,

1025
00:45:46,737 --> 00:45:48,411
please line up over there at the table

1026
00:45:48,411 --> 00:45:50,351
and we are gonna do some book signing.

1027
00:45:50,351 --> 00:45:53,744
But before, we sold some
tickets for this event,

1028
00:45:53,744 --> 00:45:55,613
but what are we gonna do with the money,

1029
00:45:55,613 --> 00:45:57,553
we're actually gonna give
it to Pencils of Promise.

1030
00:45:57,553 --> 00:45:59,348
- That's awesome.
- So I just wanted

1031
00:45:59,348 --> 00:46:01,077
to mention it because I
was in touch with them

1032
00:46:01,077 --> 00:46:03,697
and they said that you are
gonna be very happy about that.

1033
00:46:03,697 --> 00:46:05,071
- Thank you.
- And

1034
00:46:05,071 --> 00:46:06,689
Can we take a picture, Derek?

1035
00:46:06,689 --> 00:46:08,569
Are you around, because
I have something for you.

1036
00:46:08,569 --> 00:46:10,084
Because this is the first time

1037
00:46:10,084 --> 00:46:12,812
in Hong Kong and I want
you to remember it.

1038
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:17,340
So we have a tee shirt, Gary
Vee hustling in Hong Kong 2017.

1039
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:20,438
- I love it, thank you.
- And Drock,

1040
00:46:20,438 --> 00:46:21,647
can you come here as well?

1041
00:46:21,647 --> 00:46:22,805
We have something for you as well,

1042
00:46:22,805 --> 00:46:24,388
because you're also a hustler.

1043
00:46:24,388 --> 00:46:27,375
So we have a tee shirt for Drock as well.

1044
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:28,406
(whoop)

1045
00:46:28,406 --> 00:46:29,648
Can we take a pic?

1046
00:46:29,648 --> 00:46:31,631
- Hope you guys got value out of that.

1047
00:46:31,631 --> 00:46:34,735
Would love for you to help
me clip some Instagram clips

1048
00:46:34,735 --> 00:46:36,980
so put timestamps in the comments

1049
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,419
of the one minute clip that I should use

1050
00:46:39,419 --> 00:46:42,544
that's a new insight or
fire that you enjoyed.

1051
00:46:42,544 --> 00:00:00,000
See ya.
