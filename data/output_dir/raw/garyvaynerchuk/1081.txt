00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,540
I get enormous amounts of excuse me

<font color="#E5E5E5">email from people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are the sons and</font>

getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little older I'm even getting</font>

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,170
some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> perspective from the dead</font>

14
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,940
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moms I have employed friends at</font>

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,520
both Wine Library and vaynermedia

vaynermedia was started<font color="#E5E5E5"> with five of</font>

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,800
AJ's dear friends and I think the the

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,690
number one advice I'd say is you should

19
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,149
absolutely I'm emphatic about this and

20
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,730
and you as you guys know I'm big on you

21
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,710
know do what works for you but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a</font>

22
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,410
huge fan of hiring friends especially

23
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,420
early on to establish culture to have

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,960
those teammates in the trenches

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,160
especially if you're willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> practice</font>

26
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,160
meritocracy right so the key to friends

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,140
is that here we are five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

28
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,299
AJ's<font color="#CCCCCC"> five to six high school and college</font>

29
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,189
friends that started the company with us

30
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:09,750
are in different places within the

31
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,330
organization and not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> treated any</font>

32
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,850
differently at the highest levels than

33
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,490
anybody else and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and very honestly I</font>

34
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,750
hope they're not listening or watching

35
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,659
the show they may even be treated

36
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,290
slightly harder and worse than everybody

37
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,810
else because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> so sensitive to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font>

38
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other direction I expect the six of</font>

39
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,220
you not to hit me up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a race and so I</font>

40
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,860
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a big fan of it I</font>

41
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,939
recommend it it is risky you I have

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,520
fired my friends in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past Brandon was</font>

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,490
my best friend growing up he runs Wine

44
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,270
Library risky it you know it really

45
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,320
comes down to here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my belief my belief</font>

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,920
is very simple if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose a friendship</font>

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,990
from somebody working for you and not

48
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">working out and you having to fire them</font>

49
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,680
or them leaving then your friendship

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,979
wasn't as strong as you thought and that

51
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,780
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom line because stuff</font>

52
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,490
I didn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I didn't do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh crap</font>

53
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,780
