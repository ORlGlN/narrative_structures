changing right word of mouth is

28
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,910

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,220
beyond and beyond um and it's going to

32
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,060
continue to keep going seesmic these are

gatekeepers the people that are spending

69
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,310
the advertising dollars right now are

and they kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of know what they're doing</font>

80
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,080
because honestly i agree with you to

you can be

135
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,240

if there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in substance nobody would</font>

141
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:35,620
care if i didn't really know everything

142
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,240
about what not if i rephrase that

143
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,710
because i don't like it go I don't know

144
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,330

building businesses before maybe this

150
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:51,460
wouldn't even make sense but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font>

151
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,080
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little substance it's not by</font>

152

little substance people get respect it

155
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,250
