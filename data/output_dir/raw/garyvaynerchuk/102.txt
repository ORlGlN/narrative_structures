1
00:00:00,017 --> 00:00:02,600
(hip-hop beat)

2
00:00:11,931 --> 00:00:14,431
(piano music)

3
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,667
- Vlog, wanna get right into the rant.

4
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,638
Maybe it's because I like
Iris more than Babin.

5
00:00:35,638 --> 00:00:37,839
I gave him nothing yesterday.

6
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:40,235
By the way, this brewing like controversy

7
00:00:40,235 --> 00:00:42,266
of the different filmers and producers,

8
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:45,234
this battle is very exciting for me.

9
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:47,073
Yesterday I went to a Knicks game.

10
00:00:47,073 --> 00:00:50,446
I wore an ugly sweater,
Natty Light sweater

11
00:00:50,446 --> 00:00:52,353
because I knew I had courtside seats

12
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:54,793
and I knew that the
sweater would stand out.

13
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:57,107
Just moments ago, I was on SportsCenter.

14
00:00:57,107 --> 00:00:58,517
They were showing a ridiculous highlight

15
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:01,190
that serendipitously happened near me

16
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,182
and then I you know celebrated,

17
00:01:03,182 --> 00:01:05,063
I'm sure we're chopping it in right now.

18
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:07,988
- [Announcer] With his
accuracy went in to pass.

19
00:01:07,988 --> 00:01:09,649
Quite a finisher.

20
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:12,606
That's like one of those
DudePerfect videos.

21
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,348
The dance, I don't know

22
00:01:14,348 --> 00:01:15,538
then the sweater.

23
00:01:15,538 --> 00:01:16,599
Is that a Natty Light sweater?

24
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,432
Yes it is.

25
00:01:17,432 --> 00:01:18,534
I need it.

26
00:01:18,534 --> 00:01:20,662
- And they made a reference to me

27
00:01:20,662 --> 00:01:22,563
which then got a lot of
people who followed me

28
00:01:22,563 --> 00:01:23,697
to mention me on social.

29
00:01:23,697 --> 00:01:25,192
I engaged with them.

30
00:01:25,192 --> 00:01:26,623
This, my friends, is what's called

31
00:01:26,623 --> 00:01:29,905
Classic Attention Arbitrage, right?

32
00:01:29,905 --> 00:01:33,913
Understanding what you need
to do not only digitally

33
00:01:33,913 --> 00:01:38,252
or by being in the community
90 times, two cents at a time,

34
00:01:38,252 --> 00:01:40,066
but also understanding in real life.

35
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,069
You know, whether it's your speaking style

36
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,042
and it's not about being
provocative or ridiculous

37
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:45,519
for the sake of being ridiculous,

38
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,714
you need to be authentic
to yourself, right?

39
00:01:47,714 --> 00:01:50,268
And so it's not a Mohawk or a big hat,

40
00:01:50,268 --> 00:01:52,418
it's like, I can wear some
sweaters, I can do that,

41
00:01:52,418 --> 00:01:53,669
I'm comfortable with that.

42
00:01:53,669 --> 00:01:56,362
So it's not forcing it
'cause lack of authenticity

43
00:01:56,362 --> 00:02:00,101
is the vulnerability at the
macro of this whole game

44
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:02,547
but it's also understanding the nuances,

45
00:02:02,547 --> 00:02:05,665
how it actually works, what
the world really trades on,

46
00:02:05,665 --> 00:02:07,737
what breaks out, that I
think we've seen a lot of

47
00:02:07,737 --> 00:02:10,985
bad versions of people hacking attention,

48
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:12,235
playing to

49
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:14,880
the worst of our traits

50
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,685
and we've seen that historically
in many different ways,

51
00:02:17,685 --> 00:02:21,338
in culture, in politics,
in government, in business

52
00:02:21,338 --> 00:02:24,807
and a million different ways
but there's a fun way to do it.

53
00:02:24,807 --> 00:02:28,159
Wearing an ugly sweater courtside
at Madison Square Garden

54
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,133
is a fun way to do it,
it's a subtle way to do it

55
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:33,047
and it's an intriguing way to do it

56
00:02:33,047 --> 00:02:35,836
and there's a lot of micro
ways to do it as well.

57
00:02:35,836 --> 00:02:39,327
So be thoughtful of not
only your online hacking

58
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:42,254
of attention and the
execution of the creative

59
00:02:42,254 --> 00:02:46,186
but also offline, also
when you're at conferences.

60
00:02:46,186 --> 00:02:48,645
So many of you are gonna
waste so much money

61
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:51,145
on buying a booth at a trade show.

62
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:54,850
In 2018, at least do something
interesting about it,

63
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,915
not giving away a free
stress ball chotchky

64
00:02:57,915 --> 00:03:01,915
or a charger with your logo on it Rick.

65
00:03:03,423 --> 00:03:05,662
- Gary I'd like to introduce
you to David Bassinger,

66
00:03:05,662 --> 00:03:06,495
the head of our business.

67
00:03:06,495 --> 00:03:07,328
- Hi, I'm David.

68
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:08,278
- David, such a pleasure.

69
00:03:08,278 --> 00:03:09,111
Thank you so much for having me.

70
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:10,123
- No, thanks for joining us.

71
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,083
- Yeah I'm really excited about it.

72
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,038
- Heard a lot about you.

73
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:13,055
I'm sorry we weren't able to talk in the--

74
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:14,263
- No worries, no worries.

75
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:16,111
I've got what I needed.

76
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:18,826
All I truly need is to reverse engineer

77
00:03:18,826 --> 00:03:20,812
what the audience needs.

78
00:03:20,812 --> 00:03:22,715
And so I have enough context at this point

79
00:03:22,715 --> 00:03:24,509
between the B to B and B to C behavior

80
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:27,681
and the regionality and
actually I didn't get that.

81
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:31,299
They're from all over Europe,
where the companies from?

82
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:33,158
- Predominantly North America.

83
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:33,991
- Okay.

84
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:35,940
- We do have a few guests from--

85
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,773
- Right, got it.

86
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:38,418
But it's this predominantly
North American.

87
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:42,297
- And North America means 90% U.S.

88
00:03:42,297 --> 00:03:43,238
- A little Canada.

89
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:45,179
- Little bit of Canada,
small or little less of--

90
00:03:45,179 --> 00:03:47,345
- And what would be your
guess at B to B versus B to C

91
00:03:47,345 --> 00:03:49,845
by percentage of the audience?

92
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:52,337
- 75% B to B.

93
00:03:52,337 --> 00:03:55,104
- Yeah and their B's, when their B

94
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:57,706
that they're connecting to, food services?

95
00:03:57,706 --> 00:04:00,738
- Yes, retail distribution.

96
00:04:00,738 --> 00:04:05,555
So we send everything from
the growers to the processors

97
00:04:05,555 --> 00:04:07,209
to the logistics--

98
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:08,733
- To the distributors.

99
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:09,902
- To the retailers.

100
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:10,748
- I understand.

101
00:04:10,748 --> 00:04:12,439
- So it's probably pretty even--

102
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,272
- Spread.

103
00:04:13,272 --> 00:04:15,655
- Spread across those five
little or so segments.

104
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:16,488
- I understand.

105
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:17,321
Fantastic.

106
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:20,165
- They're all really
excited about hearing about

107
00:04:20,165 --> 00:04:21,601
the full chain.

108
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:25,015
We always talk, our measure
has always been farm--

109
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,689
- To table or a fork.

110
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:28,937
- And now we're going, actually now it's

111
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:31,537
fork driving farm to a
large degree as well.

112
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:32,525
So that's--

113
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:33,995
- Consumer centric.

114
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:35,165
- That's the theme today.

115
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:37,289
- You know, one of the things
that really works for me

116
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:39,297
and getting a little behind
the scenes here again Iris.

117
00:04:39,297 --> 00:04:41,916
This is strictly because I like
you so much more than Babin,

118
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,127
is I'm giving you so much here.

119
00:04:43,127 --> 00:04:45,446
I mean, the vlog's already
done, I mean we're done here.

120
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:46,443
I mean you're done.

121
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:49,133
You know, we'll call it a day.

122
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:52,263
If you notice this, I
don't really prep for,

123
00:04:52,263 --> 00:04:54,249
I talk a lot about improv, I don't prep.

124
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:55,212
It's pretty simple.

125
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,902
I work backwards.

126
00:04:56,902 --> 00:04:58,516
Most people think about their business

127
00:04:58,516 --> 00:04:59,649
and then figure out the customer.

128
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:01,486
I think about the customer and
then figure out the business.

129
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:03,193
I've already understand what's
happening in the customer

130
00:05:03,193 --> 00:05:04,774
in a B to B and B to C environment.

131
00:05:04,774 --> 00:05:07,470
It's what I spend 100% of my time on.

132
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,239
And so then when I come
here because of my history

133
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,695
of 25 years of understanding business

134
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:13,385
and really intuitive, kind
of entrepreneurial gifts

135
00:05:13,385 --> 00:05:17,243
that I was handed in DNA
wise, it came natural to me,

136
00:05:17,243 --> 00:05:19,132
that's it, that's it.

137
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:19,965
What was this?

138
00:05:19,965 --> 00:05:22,601
Three minutes of talk between two people?

139
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:24,632
Like I'm gonna go slay,

140
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:27,329
completely go savage on
these people's faces,

141
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:29,140
one of the best talks they'll ever see

142
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,981
and it wasn't 40 years of
you know, it wasn't 40.

143
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:34,656
It wasn't four to 10 hours of research,

144
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:36,694
it wasn't making a deck for six hours,

145
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:38,330
editing it in here right now,

146
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,758
it's because I bet on my strengths.

147
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,543
I know what's going on with the consumer,

148
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:45,667
which makes disproportionately
more powerful always.

149
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:46,532
The end.

150
00:05:46,532 --> 00:05:49,564
Whoever is closest to
the consumer, Amazon,

151
00:05:49,564 --> 00:05:51,240
me with the way I community manage,

152
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,442
read, spend all my time
consuming that, right?

153
00:05:54,442 --> 00:05:57,022
Also deploying empathy,
not being short term,

154
00:05:57,022 --> 00:06:01,517
so I'm not for as much,
I'm so pro consumer, you.

155
00:06:01,517 --> 00:06:03,505
I'm so pro you.

156
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:05,858
But that gives me the
understanding and the leverage

157
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:07,361
and then I just deploy because

158
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:08,901
everything else is the same shit.

159
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,068
Like this

160
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:11,871
and this,

161
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:15,783
and as big as this is, right?

162
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,728
And this, right?

163
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:22,540
It's all the same at the
end, gotta reverse engineer

164
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,084
and bring value.

165
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,109
Hey.

166
00:06:25,109 --> 00:06:26,831
- So while you're
speaking, all three screens

167
00:06:26,831 --> 00:06:27,914
that we have will be on IMAG.

168
00:06:27,914 --> 00:06:28,747
- Yup.

169
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:30,696
- And then during Q&A we'll
put up your agency slide

170
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:31,561
that we received.

171
00:06:31,561 --> 00:06:32,394
- Okay.

172
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:33,827
- Alright awesome, thank you.

173
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:34,953
- Your welcome.

174
00:06:34,953 --> 00:06:37,940
Is there any way that you can put that up,

175
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,452
the agency slide in the
first like two, three minutes

176
00:06:41,452 --> 00:06:43,131
for people that may
wanna tweet along at home

177
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:43,991
or anything of that?

178
00:06:43,991 --> 00:06:45,385
I know the demo of the audience but still,

179
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:46,501
just to give them some context?

180
00:06:46,501 --> 00:06:47,334
- Sure, sure.

181
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:48,429
- Like maybe the first two
minutes and then switch

182
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:49,938
and then end with?

183
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:50,771
- Okay, sounds good, we can do that.

184
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:51,604
- Awesome.

185
00:06:51,604 --> 00:06:55,840
By the way, in my continuation
here, this is all for Iris,

186
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,700
if you noticed, I don't if Iris caught it,

187
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,007
I asked for them, they said
we're gonna show you live

188
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:01,345
and then the last 20 minutes,
we'll show your slide.

189
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:03,313
My slide has my information.

190
00:07:03,313 --> 00:07:06,906
My URLs, my YouTube channel, my Facebook.

191
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:08,861
I asked for the first two or three minutes

192
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,482
for it to be shown and
then do what they want.

193
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:12,547
Why did I do that?

194
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:13,924
Because it's the same game.

195
00:07:13,924 --> 00:07:15,089
Attention arbitrage.

196
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:16,901
If only three people in that room,

197
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:18,183
and that's supposed to be a conservative

198
00:07:18,183 --> 00:07:21,526
baby boomer audience so I'm
looking at three of the 300.

199
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:24,100
If three of them look up,
see my Twitter handle,

200
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,661
follow me and start
tweeting along the way,

201
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:29,044
even to 27 followers, right,

202
00:07:29,044 --> 00:07:33,094
one person from that
one person may follow me

203
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:35,053
or be intrigued by something that person

204
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:36,872
that's tweeting along while I speak,

205
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:38,251
quote storing my talk.

206
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:40,531
That is why suddenly,
something that wouldn't

207
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:42,231
normally be edited into this vlog,

208
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:43,731
in a world where I'm
trying to show you more

209
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:47,713
of my subtle nature, my
nuances, that $1.80 strategy,

210
00:07:47,713 --> 00:07:49,235
I'm trying to challenge myself

211
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,178
especially when I love the
person behind the camera.

212
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:53,119
So if D-Rock was here,
Babin, Kyle, no I would not.

213
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:55,061
But for Iris, I'm gonna push it out here,

214
00:07:55,061 --> 00:07:56,891
make a much better vlog,
make the best vlog ever,

215
00:07:56,891 --> 00:07:58,831
this is gonna be the best episode ever.

216
00:07:58,831 --> 00:08:00,733
You know that's why I ask for it.

217
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:03,318
That little subtle thing
of asking for the first

218
00:08:03,318 --> 00:08:05,148
two minutes to have
this slide will lead to

219
00:08:05,148 --> 00:08:08,945
one potential person tweeting
my quotes along my talk

220
00:08:08,945 --> 00:08:12,414
to 27 followers which one person may

221
00:08:12,414 --> 00:08:16,448
actually find interesting which
will create them to follow.

222
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:17,443
One.

223
00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:19,044
The acquisition of one.

224
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:20,559
It matters.

225
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:22,901
No matter how many people
you have following you.

226
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:26,107
- Please join me in welcoming
to the stage, Gary Vaynerchuk.

227
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:29,001
(audience applause)

228
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:30,001
- Thank you.

229
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:34,568
Morning.

230
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:37,843
Very, very happy to be here.

231
00:08:37,844 --> 00:08:41,309
Really enjoyed the opening monologue.

232
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:44,197
In the context of today's morning,

233
00:08:44,198 --> 00:08:47,353
I tweeted just now, it's been interesting

234
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:49,717
over the last 72 hours whether in a

235
00:08:49,717 --> 00:08:52,610
Wall Street Journal interview
or a business meeting,

236
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,314
now a conference and a lot
of one on one meetings,

237
00:08:56,314 --> 00:08:58,462
I've heard the same thing
about 11 or 12 times

238
00:08:58,462 --> 00:09:01,428
and it struck me finally
this last time on stage

239
00:09:01,428 --> 00:09:04,522
which is how many people
keep saying the word

240
00:09:04,522 --> 00:09:07,703
or the sentence, it's
changing, it's changing.

241
00:09:07,703 --> 00:09:10,395
I think anybody here this
morning that hasn't fully

242
00:09:10,395 --> 00:09:14,290
quantified how much has actually changed,

243
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,890
this has changed.

244
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,587
I think there is an
unbelievable disconnect

245
00:09:18,587 --> 00:09:20,527
between the framework and strategy of how

246
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,140
we are running our businesses,

247
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,531
whether a B to B or B to C environment

248
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:28,705
on us calibrating, is it
changing or has it changed?

249
00:09:28,705 --> 00:09:33,415
And more importantly, the
practicality of the timing.

250
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:35,754
I spent very little time on the impact

251
00:09:35,754 --> 00:09:38,363
of self-driving cars in a micro,

252
00:09:38,363 --> 00:09:40,949
in a 24 or 36 month window

253
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:44,547
but I try to understand and
quantify them in a macro.

254
00:09:44,547 --> 00:09:46,236
I'm not in the luck business,

255
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:48,233
I'm in the marathon running business

256
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:51,025
and more importantly, I'm
in the timing business.

257
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:54,100
I'm so deeply, actually consumer centric

258
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,436
that I don't have any other gear.

259
00:09:56,436 --> 00:09:59,010
The only thing I ever do
is try to reverse engineer

260
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,716
the attention of my end consumer

261
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:03,995
whether in a B to C or B to B environment,

262
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:06,628
and I try to understand things like,

263
00:10:06,628 --> 00:10:09,854
it blows my mind how many people here

264
00:10:09,854 --> 00:10:11,595
feel comfortable

265
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:15,309
because they have long term
contracts and relationships

266
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:17,154
with some of the biggest
companies in the world

267
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:19,525
without realizing that
those companies themselves

268
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:22,501
are so disproportionately vulnerable.

269
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:24,866
And I just, you know, I
play with this, right?

270
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:26,767
I play with the fact that $80 billion

271
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:28,932
is spent on television commercials

272
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:31,289
on the Fortune 500 CPG Brand side

273
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:33,771
yet 94% of them lost market share

274
00:10:33,771 --> 00:10:35,347
because not a human being on Earth

275
00:10:35,347 --> 00:10:37,632
watches a television commercial.

276
00:10:37,632 --> 00:10:40,981
Literally nothing we talk
about, or way more importantly,

277
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:43,521
literally nothing that
controls the attention

278
00:10:43,521 --> 00:10:46,938
of our end consumer existed 13 years ago.

279
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:49,881
We need to take a big
step back in this room

280
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:51,449
and understand what we are talking about

281
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:54,179
is not social media or Snapchat.

282
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:56,394
What we are talking about is the maturity

283
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:58,641
of the internet itself.

284
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:01,405
What that means to the human race

285
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:03,573
and everybody in this room including me

286
00:11:03,573 --> 00:11:06,528
is so disproportionately misunderstanding

287
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:08,660
how substantial this shift is

288
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,460
and what happens over the
course of the next decade.

289
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,419
The internet is the middle man, period.

290
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:19,481
It was some guy or gal that
owned 13 medallions in Texas.

291
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:21,964
In this city, second or third.

292
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:25,593
It is the hotel rooms
and the supply and demand

293
00:11:25,593 --> 00:11:28,424
of that world's turn today.

294
00:11:28,424 --> 00:11:31,495
It is the media companies
across the board's

295
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:35,047
turn right now and it may
be your business next.

296
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:37,612
Wal-mart's not gonna
give you the contract.

297
00:11:37,612 --> 00:11:39,290
Wal-mart's gonna have to do it itself.

298
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,365
They're gonna buy dairy farms.

299
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:43,346
They're gonna grow the grain.

300
00:11:43,346 --> 00:11:45,743
Everything gets shrunk.

301
00:11:45,743 --> 00:11:48,148
And so we have to take a real step back

302
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:51,430
and understand that there
is only one thing, one,

303
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,997
there's one thing that will
keep you from being a commodity.

304
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:57,473
Your brand.

305
00:11:57,473 --> 00:12:00,366
The only thing that will keep you away

306
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:03,258
from being completely
commoditized is your brand.

307
00:12:03,258 --> 00:12:05,413
Can you create an
environment where somebody

308
00:12:05,413 --> 00:12:08,116
actually makes an emotional decision

309
00:12:08,116 --> 00:12:11,028
or a subconscious decision,
not a practical one.

310
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:12,824
Because if you're in the middle

311
00:12:12,824 --> 00:12:15,374
and people are gonna
make practical decisions,

312
00:12:15,374 --> 00:12:18,244
there's an enormous amount of
vulnerability in the system.

313
00:12:18,244 --> 00:12:20,883
And so look, this is real disruption.

314
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:22,179
This isn't haha.

315
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:25,151
This is over the course
of the next decade,

316
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:30,144
90, 80, 70% of the biggest
companies in multiple sectors

317
00:12:30,144 --> 00:12:33,627
will not only decline
but completely diminish

318
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,320
and completely vanish.

319
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,113
That is minor leagues
compared to the fundamental

320
00:12:40,113 --> 00:12:42,136
human shifts we're going through.

321
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,769
Did anybody see the robot that went viral

322
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:46,321
on the internet the other day?

323
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:48,228
This like robot that was
doing like twists and turns?

324
00:12:48,228 --> 00:12:49,061
How many people?

325
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,228
Just raise your hands, I'm curious.

326
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:54,271
Did you see what Elon Musk said about it?

327
00:12:54,271 --> 00:12:56,457
Which was, so there's this
robot, you have to find this.

328
00:12:56,457 --> 00:12:57,743
I don't have a lot of
data on this, so you know

329
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,051
it's in the feed, in the
headline reading society,

330
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:01,737
I don't like to talk
about things I don't know.

331
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:02,581
Here's what I know.

332
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,619
A robot that scared the crap out of me

333
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:06,470
was in my feed, right?

334
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,094
Just doing stuff that makes
Lebron look like me, right?

335
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:13,996
Elon Musk decides to take
that, somebody more educated

336
00:13:13,996 --> 00:13:17,081
in robotics than I am, and
said something very clever

337
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:19,148
and I know enough about
how he communicates

338
00:13:19,148 --> 00:13:22,114
where he's like, you think this is cute?

339
00:13:22,114 --> 00:13:24,873
In 24 or 36, I don't remember the timing,

340
00:13:24,873 --> 00:13:28,379
very shortly, you won't even
be able to see this robot

341
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:30,993
without technology that it will be so fast

342
00:13:30,993 --> 00:13:33,581
that the human eye can't even see it.

343
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:35,514
Everybody in this room needs to realize

344
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:39,218
that we're about to run
an incredibly fascinating

345
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,688
business marathon and
most of you aren't even

346
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,106
on the treadmill yet and let me explain.

347
00:13:45,106 --> 00:13:48,334
The treadmill to me is
how you spend your money

348
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:50,041
on marketing and sales.

349
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,374
Thank you.

350
00:13:51,374 --> 00:13:52,749
(audience applause)

351
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,249
(piano music)

352
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:24,568
The only way you're gonna
win this is to run a marathon

353
00:14:24,568 --> 00:14:27,161
when it feels like you
need to run a sprint.

354
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:28,863
So first and foremost,
there's no right way.

355
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,114
You don't look at me and
that's the right way to do it.

356
00:14:31,114 --> 00:14:32,607
There's only one right way.

357
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:36,023
What's right for you as
an actual human being.

358
00:14:36,023 --> 00:14:38,444
First and foremost, personal
brand, a lot of people

359
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,054
try to fix things and make
people what they're not

360
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:43,237
versus going all in on what they are.

361
00:14:43,237 --> 00:14:45,116
You have to go all in on who you are.

362
00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:46,502
I don't even know what else to tell you.

363
00:14:46,502 --> 00:14:48,814
Like this is the framework,
I call it a blueprint,

364
00:14:48,814 --> 00:14:50,076
you call it a principle,

365
00:14:50,076 --> 00:14:51,566
it's the punchline.

366
00:14:51,566 --> 00:14:53,010
It's short term, long term.

367
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,386
It's the value of patience.

368
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:56,273
It's micro failures, macro wins.

369
00:14:56,273 --> 00:14:57,935
It's just all the same shit.

370
00:14:57,935 --> 00:14:59,236
One of the things that's interesting is

371
00:14:59,236 --> 00:15:01,851
I live much more in principles.

372
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:03,447
To me, things are very macro.

373
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:06,607
There's rules about
patience and the long game

374
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:10,892
and humility, self-awareness,
lack of romance.

375
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:12,269
I'm just not romantic about anything

376
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:14,252
that happened yesterday,
things of that nature.

377
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:16,886
Well what that does is
it gets very theoretical.

378
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:19,195
And I'm concerned that
my audience is getting

379
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:22,114
the framework but they are
so hungry for the details,

380
00:15:22,114 --> 00:15:23,860
back to schooling and
things of that nature

381
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,752
and I always say, leave that to others.

382
00:15:25,752 --> 00:15:27,603
But once in awhile I get inspired.

383
00:15:27,603 --> 00:15:31,721
So I said look, there's
nine posts per hashtag.

384
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:34,585
Every day I want you to pick 20 hashtags

385
00:15:34,585 --> 00:15:36,891
that are relevant to your business

386
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:38,931
or your ambitions, your nonprofit,

387
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:40,255
whatever it may be, right?

388
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:42,733
So nine times two cents for every post,

389
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,801
go to those posts, look at
the post, consume the post

390
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:48,241
and add value to the conversation.

391
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:52,805
You end up leaving $1.80 a day
of your two cents times 90.

392
00:15:52,805 --> 00:15:53,892
- [Ray] Ooh, cool.

393
00:15:53,892 --> 00:15:54,952
- It is very practical.

394
00:15:54,952 --> 00:15:55,785
- [Ray] Right.

395
00:15:55,785 --> 00:15:57,953
- And that is very rare for me because

396
00:15:57,953 --> 00:16:00,849
I'm just not into that,
it's not how I process.

397
00:16:00,849 --> 00:16:03,014
- [Ray] But you see,
you know those things.

398
00:16:03,014 --> 00:16:04,595
Do it in your own way.

399
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:06,686
You can just knock these
things off like this.

400
00:16:06,686 --> 00:16:08,599
- You'll love this Ray, I apologize.

401
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:09,971
This is insane that this is happening.

402
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:11,530
Iris this is how you have to edit today.

403
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,272
Today, Iris came to me,
she films me all day today.

404
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:16,141
I'm at a conference, I'm making a joke

405
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,405
that I like her the best
more than D-Rock and Babin,

406
00:16:18,405 --> 00:16:20,745
the other people that film me,
and I said because of that,

407
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:23,032
I'm gonna start articulating
and this is maybe

408
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:24,175
in the subconscious, I didn't even know

409
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:25,347
we were doing the Q&A show today.

410
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:26,957
Theoretically, I knew
it was coming this week

411
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:29,025
but it coulda been tomorrow, I literally

412
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:30,110
started explaining things.

413
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,133
They came to me and they said,

414
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:34,011
we're gonna put up your slide
at the end of your talk.

415
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:36,637
I said, can you put up the
slide for the first two minutes

416
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:39,119
when I go up there and
then you can show me live

417
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:40,619
on the three different screens

418
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:42,375
and then you can end with my slide.

419
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,750
Is there any way that you can put that up,

420
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,268
the agency slide in the first
like two, three minutes--

421
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:50,821
That's just my normal demeanor.

422
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:52,855
But what I did was I challenged myself,

423
00:16:52,855 --> 00:16:54,141
back to what you just asked me to do,

424
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:55,963
and I looked in the camera and I explained

425
00:16:55,963 --> 00:16:59,667
to my audience, in real
time, why I did that.

426
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:01,450
I asked for the first two or three minutes

427
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,960
for it to be shown and
then do what they want.

428
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,930
Why did I do that?

429
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,323
Because it's the same game.

430
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:07,469
Attention arbitrage.

431
00:17:07,469 --> 00:17:10,314
And it's because, the way Twitter works,

432
00:17:10,314 --> 00:17:12,738
if there was even one
person in that audience

433
00:17:12,738 --> 00:17:15,146
that would see the slide
go up, follow me on Twitter

434
00:17:15,146 --> 00:17:16,881
or get to know what my handle was

435
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:20,209
and they wanted to tweet my
quotes while I was speaking,

436
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:21,843
that wouldn't have been able to be done

437
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:23,241
had the slides come at the end

438
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:25,238
and that's why I always ask for my slide

439
00:17:25,238 --> 00:17:26,500
to go up in the first two minutes

440
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,550
with my social media
handles so that the audience

441
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,520
could become the
amplification of awareness

442
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,396
of what I have to say and so I'm starting

443
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:34,780
to get into a process in
this point in my career

444
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,600
where I am starting to challenge myself

445
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,585
to get into these details and I assume

446
00:17:38,585 --> 00:17:40,225
that makes a lot of sense to
you because that's what you do.

447
00:17:40,225 --> 00:00:00,000
