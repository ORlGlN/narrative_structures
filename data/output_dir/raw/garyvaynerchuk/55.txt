1
00:00:00,978 --> 00:00:03,895
(indie rock music)

2
00:00:07,172 --> 00:00:08,716
- [Boyd] Yo, I'm excited that everyone's

3
00:00:08,716 --> 00:00:10,748
finally able to meet,

4
00:00:10,748 --> 00:00:13,552
Yeah, so, is everyone in the room?

5
00:00:13,552 --> 00:00:14,550
- Everyone's in the room.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,623
- [Boyd] Alright, cool, hell yeah.

7
00:00:16,623 --> 00:00:19,074
There's a few things, straight off the bat

8
00:00:19,074 --> 00:00:22,851
that I think Gary, and
Anik should talk about,

9
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:26,091
like growing up, immigrant community,

10
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:27,893
similar to you, Gary, you know,

11
00:00:27,893 --> 00:00:30,862
one bedroom, a lot of
people sharing that room

12
00:00:30,862 --> 00:00:32,924
like, there's a lot of similarities.

13
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:34,202
- Bangladesh, right?
- Yeah.

14
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:36,105
- [Boyd] That you guys
could maybe build off of,

15
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:37,140
and then also, like, the music

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,401
so, the Kites project, he's
really telling his story

17
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:42,413
like, talking about Queens, New York,

18
00:00:42,413 --> 00:00:45,278
but also like, he has
his sister on the intro,

19
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,903
and takes you to the borough,
and really telling his story

20
00:00:48,903 --> 00:00:51,878
and it's such an important
time for the immigrant story

21
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:54,482
in general, just with
what's going on with America

22
00:00:54,482 --> 00:00:57,935
so, it's like, he's really
shaped it up to have this,

23
00:00:57,935 --> 00:01:00,992
he already has a good following,
but it's really looking

24
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:03,288
like it might go crazy,
and then the other thing

25
00:01:03,288 --> 00:01:05,193
that I think is real interesting, is

26
00:01:05,193 --> 00:01:08,962
he did an interview with Beats 1 recently,

27
00:01:08,962 --> 00:01:12,141
and one of the things he said, was

28
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:14,153
for a while, he was
looking at himself like

29
00:01:14,153 --> 00:01:16,053
looking at the goal as if
it was a kite, or whatever

30
00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:18,643
like Madison Square Garden is the goal,

31
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:21,714
but then you started to
look at it more as like,

32
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:23,436
who's helped steering that kite

33
00:01:23,436 --> 00:01:25,017
so it's almost like reverse engineering,

34
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:26,544
and now he's focusing more on, like

35
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,639
the people who are burning
up there and getting up there

36
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:30,402
and his space, and his communities,

37
00:01:30,402 --> 00:01:32,334
so I thought that was pretty cool,

38
00:01:32,334 --> 00:01:34,938
and along the lines of a lot
of stuff you're talking about

39
00:01:34,938 --> 00:01:36,604
so I'm excited you guys
are meeting right now.

40
00:01:36,604 --> 00:01:37,881
- Thanks Boyd.

41
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:40,563
Well it's awesome to meet
you guys, real pleasure.

42
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:42,719
- Yeah.
- Yeah, for sure, so, you know

43
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,137
talking about reverse engineering

44
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:46,888
like, knowing that you
have a little context,

45
00:01:46,888 --> 00:01:50,075
I think what's most
always interesting to me,

46
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:52,491
and I know that you guys have a sense that

47
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:54,726
Boyd and I are meeting
with a lot of artists, and

48
00:01:54,726 --> 00:01:59,076
it's really a very simple
model, I just basically

49
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:02,832
trust Boyd implicitly,
and then it becomes a game

50
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:07,048
of, like, how do I bring
disproportionate value?

51
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:10,050
And then the chips fall,
karma is practical, right?

52
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,226
That's really kind of how I think about it

53
00:02:12,226 --> 00:02:16,167
and so, would love to know,
in the short term or long term

54
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:19,496
if there's anything I could help with,

55
00:02:19,496 --> 00:02:21,554
and answer anything that
might be on your mind.

56
00:02:21,554 --> 00:02:24,763
And that's kind of like, it's
really quite simple, for me.

57
00:02:24,763 --> 00:02:27,283
Like, I just feel like, obviously, music,

58
00:02:27,283 --> 00:02:30,187
and specifically hip hop music,
is so culturally important

59
00:02:30,187 --> 00:02:34,291
to me, and so I associate
with it, because, whether it's

60
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:38,134
India, or Russia, or in the
African-American communities,

61
00:02:38,134 --> 00:02:41,710
it's all the same story
of the rising up, right?

62
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,766
And so, would love to know if
there's anything that pops,

63
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,722
you know, especially if
you have that much context,

64
00:02:47,722 --> 00:02:49,673
I mean like, anything I can help with, or,

65
00:02:49,673 --> 00:02:51,823
I'd love to know a little
bit more about the story,

66
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:53,544
how it's going and the state of the union,

67
00:02:53,544 --> 00:02:55,271
of where we're at right now.

68
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:58,955
- Yeah, absolutely, so,
obviously, I make music

69
00:02:58,955 --> 00:03:03,455
and I've been, I've recently
dropped the project Kites

70
00:03:03,455 --> 00:03:06,975
and like Boyd was saying,
it's like a perspective,

71
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:09,774
an aerial perspective of
what's important to me now

72
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:12,002
- And how many projects have you dropped?

73
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:12,866
- Two.

74
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:13,699
- Two.
- Yeah.

75
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:15,660
- [Kaz] This is your first full length.

76
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,847
- Yeah, this is my first full length.

77
00:03:16,847 --> 00:03:18,484
The first one was called
"I Don't Know Yet",

78
00:03:18,484 --> 00:03:20,155
and I was going through,
like, a lot of industry shit

79
00:03:20,155 --> 00:03:22,982
and it was called "I Don't Know
Yet" because I didn't really

80
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:25,062
- Because you didn't know yet!
- Yes, exactly.

81
00:03:25,062 --> 00:03:27,500
So I don't really consider
that my first offer.

82
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,488
- It's a good name for a first project.

83
00:03:29,488 --> 00:03:31,521
(laughing)
- Yeah, thanks.

84
00:03:31,521 --> 00:03:33,524
- And when was that?

85
00:03:33,524 --> 00:03:35,439
- That was in 2015 I believe.

86
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,242
- It was a mix tape?
- Yeah.

87
00:03:37,242 --> 00:03:39,533
- And how many songs?

88
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:40,442
- Like, seven.

89
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:41,987
- I have a lot of traveling this week,

90
00:03:41,987 --> 00:03:45,060
so I'm gonna listen to
everything, this week.

91
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,068
Okay, go ahead.

92
00:03:46,068 --> 00:03:47,432
- Download Kites
- I will.

93
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:49,509
But you know what's funny, like, I get it,

94
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:52,141
and like, I think about
my books, or my talks,

95
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:54,503
there's still so much good
stuff in the first, you know?

96
00:03:54,503 --> 00:03:57,694
First of all, the first
thing with me, with hip hop

97
00:03:57,694 --> 00:03:59,164
is, I don't actually think I really

98
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:00,531
understand music very well,

99
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:04,310
the reason I think I resonate
so much with hip hop, is

100
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,513
I only care about the
words, almost saying like,

101
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:09,538
poem, and like, reading mentality,

102
00:04:09,538 --> 00:04:11,963
to me, the artists I most associate with,

103
00:04:11,963 --> 00:04:15,502
there's nothing to do with
beats, or the hook, nothing.

104
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:19,470
It's 100% the words, the
analogies, or just like,

105
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,408
clever cultural references
that make me laugh, you know?

106
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:25,880
I still think I love 21
Savage because he mentioned

107
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,439
Randy "The Macho Man" Savage,

108
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,504
I'm not even sure there was anything else!

109
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:30,998
- What are you listening to now?

110
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:34,291
- You know, I'm listening
to a lot of, I mean

111
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,400
so what's funny about the way I listen,

112
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,699
so I listen to a lot of older
Nas right now, weirdly enough

113
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,211
- Talk that shit, Gary, dog.

114
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:43,943
- Yeah, it's super interesting,

115
00:04:43,943 --> 00:04:45,661
Boyd's feeding me a lot of good stuff,

116
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:48,208
like, a lot of female vocalists
are super interesting to me

117
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:52,629
and then, like, you know,
Cardi, I like seeing why,

118
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:54,962
I love analyzing why, right?

119
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,050
Like, to me, I'm really
good at reverse engineering,

120
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,633
so like, watching, whether it's

121
00:05:03,543 --> 00:05:06,361
what Coach K's trying
to do with his artists,

122
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:08,976
and like, will it work, and what happens?

123
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,665
I grew up when P Diddy was like,

124
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:12,892
okay, now it's Mase, right, now it's this

125
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:15,807
and trying to figure
out, even when you have,

126
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:18,798
so, I have all the marketing leverage,

127
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:22,546
when I lose or win 20 years from now,

128
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:26,262
there's a reason why, even
when you have all the leverage

129
00:05:26,262 --> 00:05:27,900
certain artists don't win.

130
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,241
- Right.
- Right?

131
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:32,716
You can put em' on, they can
show up on every right track,

132
00:05:32,716 --> 00:05:34,671
you can put $20,000,000 behind them,

133
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:37,439
they could be in RapCaviar,
why don't they win?

134
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,728
So, a lot of what I do with music

135
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:43,146
is more of, like, trying to figure out why

136
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:47,313
things organically win, when
can you make something win,

137
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,240
when it wouldn't have won without you,

138
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,270
and why you lose when the machine tried

139
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,255
to put everything behind you.

140
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:58,464
- [Kaz] Well you should talk about how

141
00:05:58,464 --> 00:05:59,989
you had like, offers, for record labels,

142
00:05:59,989 --> 00:06:01,923
when you had "I Don't Know Yet", right?

143
00:06:01,923 --> 00:06:05,100
- Yeah, no, it was
definitely before like, I had

144
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,332
- Before we do that, who
is everybody in the crew?

145
00:06:09,332 --> 00:06:11,267
You're the artist, that I understand.

146
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:14,119
- Kaz, publicist slash branding agent.

147
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:17,193
- And how did you guys connect?

148
00:06:17,193 --> 00:06:20,899
- Oh, so that's where kind
of like, we had sparring wars

149
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:23,406
me and Dominic, the manager,
I said, I tweeted at Amik

150
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:26,138
after I saw him live, because
that's when he won me over.

151
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:28,502
I kinda heard about him as,
like this singer that was like,

152
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:30,263
- But what do you do?

153
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:32,955
- I'm a publicist, so I
do a lot of the features,

154
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:34,131
oh, I'm a music publicist, yeah.

155
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:35,142
- [Gary] Understood.

156
00:06:35,142 --> 00:06:37,852
So you're living your life,
you've heard a little bit

157
00:06:37,852 --> 00:06:41,533
you see him live, you're like,
now I believe, and hit him up

158
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:43,756
- Yeah, I tweeted at him,
and then we connected

159
00:06:43,756 --> 00:06:45,796
and it took a couple of meetings,

160
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:46,956
and we finally started to work together.

161
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:49,218
- Understood, okay.

162
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:53,538
- So I co-manage Anik, and I
heard his song two years ago

163
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,005
before the first project
"I Don't Know Yet",

164
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:57,737
- Just on SoundCloud, or Spotify?

165
00:06:57,737 --> 00:07:01,053
- Just on SoundCloud, and
immediately, you know, I realized,

166
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,449
- Connected.
- Yes, exactly.

167
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:05,632
- And you had aspirations
to manage at this point?

168
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:06,465
- Yes.

169
00:07:06,465 --> 00:07:07,300
- Did you manage anybody at this point?

170
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,133
No, I was,

171
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:09,185
- But it was in the back of your mind?

172
00:07:09,185 --> 00:07:11,535
- Yeah, it was in the back
of my mind, and I knew

173
00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:13,590
I wanted to work with him
specifically, because he was,

174
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,716
- But before you heard that song,

175
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:17,754
you're sitting in your room, in your life,

176
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:20,033
you'd thought about managing artists?

177
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:22,707
- Yeah, I was involved, I've known Mike

178
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:24,572
through college radio, I did radio at NYU,

179
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:27,044
and then I was a writer
for different publications,

180
00:07:27,044 --> 00:07:28,111
and stuff like that,

181
00:07:28,111 --> 00:07:29,428
- Around hip hop?
- Yeah, yes,

182
00:07:29,428 --> 00:07:31,584
it was like, Complex, and stuff like that.

183
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,296
- Understood, so you co-manage?

184
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:35,952
- [Boyd] Yeah, so like, Darnik
kind of like, for a while

185
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:38,462
he was kind of like, a young whizz kid

186
00:07:38,462 --> 00:07:40,791
in New York hip hop scene, a little bit,

187
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,465
and Amanda, actually,

188
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:44,280
I've been wanting you to
meet Amanda for a while,

189
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,043
and I think, I don't know
if she's still doing this

190
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:49,406
but she was involved in similar things,

191
00:07:49,406 --> 00:07:51,720
like what Vayner would do,
like with brands and marketing

192
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,051
and stuff like that, too.
- Understood.

193
00:07:55,051 --> 00:07:57,054
- Our story's kind of
funny, so, I used to rap,

194
00:07:57,054 --> 00:07:59,369
and that's how we met, and I
actually connected them, too

195
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:01,331
and I was like, yo, I need to speak,

196
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:03,853
I run a digital agency
now, but I worked with Anik

197
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:05,441
on a whole bunch of stuff,
- I love it.

198
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:07,709
- But, yeah, so we've all kind of been,

199
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:08,606
- What's the name of your company?

200
00:08:08,606 --> 00:08:10,318
- Green Room Creative.
- Awesome, man.

201
00:08:10,318 --> 00:08:11,382
Good for you.

202
00:08:11,382 --> 00:08:14,838
- But you know, I follow
things religiously, that you do

203
00:08:14,838 --> 00:08:18,173
but also, with this guy, getting
him to be social on social

204
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:21,589
and really leveraging the narrative,

205
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:24,820
is what we've been working on.

206
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,252
The team's strong, we know that,

207
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:29,172
it's just about getting to the next level.

208
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:30,308
- Awesome.

209
00:08:30,308 --> 00:08:33,938
- Yeah man, I guess, oh, this is Amanda.

210
00:08:33,938 --> 00:08:35,700
- Hi Amanda,
- Hi, sorry,

211
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,453
- How are you?
- Uber driver hell.

212
00:08:37,453 --> 00:08:39,609
- How are you, nice to meet you.

213
00:08:39,609 --> 00:08:40,472
- I'm Amanda, nice to meet you.

214
00:08:40,472 --> 00:08:41,437
- It's a pleasure.

215
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,091
Here, take this.
- Are you sure?

216
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:44,179
- I'm positive.
- I can stand.

217
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:47,011
Nope, it's not how we do it.

218
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:48,428
Okay, understood.

219
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:52,375
Okay, let's go back to it now.

220
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,573
- Yeah, so Kites is, obviously,

221
00:08:54,573 --> 00:08:57,389
it's like the aerial perspective
of who I think I am now,

222
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:00,089
- How old are you?
- I'm 28, about to be 29.

223
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:01,378
- You look great, fuck!
(laughing)

224
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:05,016
- So, you know, before
I used to think like,

225
00:09:05,016 --> 00:09:08,079
what's the biggest thing I
want, so I know Madison Square

226
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:09,423
and all of this stuff,
right, and like, it was up,

227
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,737
completely focused on the kite
- Of course.

228
00:09:11,737 --> 00:09:12,802
- Now, what's more important to me,

229
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,379
are the people steering
it, and the people, like,

230
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,290
waiting to be there when
I fall, so, you know,

231
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,599
pull me back up,
- Of course.

232
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,645
- And it's kind of like,
a soundtrack to Queens

233
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:24,855
from like, Queens Plaza
to Jamaica Ave, right?

234
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:28,722
And everything in between,
and that's kind of like

235
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:31,127
what I've just recently released,

236
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:32,011
- When did it come out?

237
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:32,928
- In April.

238
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:37,433
- Have we met before?
- I don't believe so, actually

239
00:09:37,433 --> 00:09:39,627
- Okay, cool, just the
way your face turned,

240
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:42,806
I was like, wait a minute, we
did meet, but okay, no worries

241
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:46,160
- And then a few months later
I had my first ever live show

242
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,343
which was wild.

243
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:49,987
- Where was that?
- Rough Trade, Brooklyn.

244
00:09:49,987 --> 00:09:52,244
First of all, I've never had a show,

245
00:09:52,244 --> 00:09:53,896
like I've never,
- I get it.

246
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:56,137
- Done a show, headliner, it
was an opener, we sold out,

247
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,342
- How many peeps'?

248
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:59,881
- 250, the capacity of the
room was sold the day before,

249
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:00,714
- Awesome, crazy right?

250
00:10:00,714 --> 00:10:01,758
- Yeah.
- It was over capacity.

251
00:10:01,758 --> 00:10:03,921
- Well, it was over, it was
only one of us four in there,

252
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:05,458
he tryina', look, I'm
gonna take all my luggage

253
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,653
(laughing)

254
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:08,957
- There was a 90 person guest
list on top of 200 visitors.

255
00:10:08,957 --> 00:10:10,408
- That's really cool.
- Three, bro.

256
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:12,826
There was the Nun with
the top thing, anyway.

257
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:14,179
- It felt great?
- Yeah, man

258
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:16,262
it was wild, it was like,

259
00:10:18,165 --> 00:10:21,368
I've never seen people
recite my music like that,

260
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:24,035
- Right,
- And I don't fuck up on stage

261
00:10:24,035 --> 00:10:25,419
But day I fucked up.

262
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:26,586
- Because you were just blown away by it?

263
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:29,103
Your mind started veering
into that, I get it.

264
00:10:29,103 --> 00:10:31,822
- I was like, you guys
know all of the songs, why?

265
00:10:31,822 --> 00:10:33,569
- I get it.

266
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:35,278
- I didn't understand
- I understand.

267
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:37,722
- And right after I went
on my first national tour

268
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:40,332
with Jidenna, he was kind enough
to put me in there with him

269
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:42,744
and that was a really dope experience,

270
00:10:42,744 --> 00:10:46,691
and I've been back for a
couple of weeks, and I'm like,

271
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:50,458
bout' to put out some
merch, I got some for you,

272
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,332
I partnered with three
businesses in Queens that I think

273
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:56,089
make the flavors of my
music, and basically, like

274
00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:00,031
this African Halal food cart,
that's also Middle-Eastern

275
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:02,603
which is kind of like, that flavor,

276
00:11:02,603 --> 00:11:06,004
also this West Indian
restaurant called Trinciti Roti,

277
00:11:06,004 --> 00:11:09,361
which is kind of like West
Indian and South Asian flavors

278
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:12,030
that I have in my music, and
then just the hood Chinese spot

279
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,363
Fatima's Chinese
- I love it.

280
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:16,951
- And it's like, all three of those,

281
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:18,447
and I got their menus on the front,

282
00:11:18,447 --> 00:11:20,665
and then shit in the back, but they're,

283
00:11:20,665 --> 00:11:22,349
I got way too much, like you
know when you go to those

284
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,221
hole-in-the-walls, and I was like, yeah,

285
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:26,784
I don't like merch that
much, cause' I don't,

286
00:11:26,784 --> 00:11:28,803
like, I wear plain stuff,
and I don't wear stuff

287
00:11:28,803 --> 00:11:30,162
with like, stuff on it, it's like,

288
00:11:30,162 --> 00:11:32,467
but, what would I wear, because
if I'm gonna make merch,

289
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:34,275
I gotta,
- 100%.

290
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:37,697
- You know, so I was like,
just eating at Trinciti,

291
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,118
and I was like, yo,
that shirt is fire, like

292
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:42,467
you know those kind of like, corny ass,

293
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:45,313
their address, big as shit on the back,

294
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:46,484
with the,
- The phone number.

295
00:11:46,484 --> 00:11:47,777
- The fuckin' phone number, everything!

296
00:11:47,777 --> 00:11:50,467
And I'm like, that's my
merch, that's fuckin' genius!

297
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:52,616
- That's cool, I like it.

298
00:11:52,616 --> 00:11:54,193
- And I partnered with them,

299
00:11:54,193 --> 00:11:57,492
but just made it more like,
you know kind of like my style,

300
00:11:57,492 --> 00:12:00,052
and we kind of played
on "Made In Bangladesh",

301
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,287
because, all them motherfuckers that go,

302
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:03,532
and take advantage of my people,

303
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:04,365
- Of course.

304
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:05,608
- Doing all this shit, like,

305
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:07,327
I actually custom tailored these

306
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:10,139
every single piece in Bangladesh,
you know, with the lines

307
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:12,760
with my boy Feekz, who manufactured them,

308
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,288
and, there's like, a lot
of layers to everything

309
00:12:15,288 --> 00:12:17,935
that I essentially put
out, cause', you know

310
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:20,326
Bangladesh hasn't really
been represented in this,

311
00:12:20,326 --> 00:12:21,407
- Environment.

312
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,744
- At all.

313
00:12:22,744 --> 00:12:26,199
- Yeah, at all, that's really cool.

314
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:27,349
- What's your story?

315
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:29,046
Boyd's been dying for us to connect.

316
00:12:29,046 --> 00:12:30,062
- Has he?
- Yes.

317
00:12:30,062 --> 00:12:31,740
- Aw! (laughing)

318
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,845
You know how I met Boyd?

319
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:35,921
My brother was working for Society,

320
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,998
that clothing brand that
was really big for a while

321
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:40,300
my brother's two years younger than me,

322
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,074
and Boyd was helping them with stuff,

323
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:44,977
and we literally, I was with the owner,

324
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:46,686
this dude Brendon, and my
brother, driving around Queens,

325
00:12:46,686 --> 00:12:51,433
picking up merch for, like,
we needed sample stuff

326
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:53,654
and he had some of it,
and he like walked in,

327
00:12:53,654 --> 00:12:55,605
like, stopped by his house,
he walked up to the car

328
00:12:55,605 --> 00:12:58,390
and we connected, and never
spoke for like two years,

329
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,805
and we ran into each other,
something like, "Oh!"

330
00:12:59,805 --> 00:13:01,284
and since then we've just been like,

331
00:13:01,284 --> 00:13:03,515
trying to make all things connect

332
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:05,219
where we can for each
other, it's really random

333
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:08,996
my brother works in real
estate and insurance now.

334
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:09,992
- I love it.

335
00:13:09,992 --> 00:13:12,409
Is that how you saw it, Boyd?

336
00:13:14,685 --> 00:13:17,757
- [Boyd] Yeah, I had in
it on mute, but yeah,

337
00:13:17,757 --> 00:13:19,091
it's been pretty epic.

338
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:22,410
- [Amanda] And that's where
we met, right, in a car?

339
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,999
- [Boyd] Yeah, I think I
jumped in the car, didn't I?

340
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,966
- [Amanda] Yeah, that sounds about right.

341
00:13:25,966 --> 00:13:27,127
- [Boyd] I'm always riding down the street

342
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:30,043
and jumping in cars.
(laughing)

343
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:34,283
- It's been working out.
(laughing)

344
00:13:34,283 --> 00:13:36,205
Well, what can I answer, if anything?

345
00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:38,026
Anybody have any questions?

346
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,943
- Yeah, like, obviously

347
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:45,889
you're really good at looking
at things from short term,

348
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:47,851
then also looking at things from long term

349
00:13:47,851 --> 00:13:49,268
and I guess, like

350
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:51,510
- Long term's super easy my man.

351
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,221
- Yeah?
- It just comes down to

352
00:13:53,221 --> 00:13:57,899
one very, very simple thing,
legacy versus currency.

353
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,015
It's that basic.
- Okay.

354
00:14:00,015 --> 00:14:02,175
- You're just making decisions
on an every day basis

355
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:06,753
about two things, the kite,
up and down to Boyd's part

356
00:14:06,753 --> 00:14:11,346
the only reason, I think,
I'm a little bit different

357
00:14:11,346 --> 00:14:13,760
than people that are
understanding it, is because

358
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,137
I have an unbelievable weird relationship

359
00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:20,304
with money and stuff, which
is, I don't like them.

360
00:14:21,155 --> 00:14:22,478
I don't know what else to say.

361
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:26,903
Every decision I make, is
predicated on my legacy.

362
00:14:26,903 --> 00:14:28,214
All of them.

363
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:30,594
I've never made a decision
for money, my entire life.

364
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:32,720
Even when I didn't have it.

365
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,924
Even, like, I needed enough
to have rent, and stuff

366
00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:39,090
but it's never been the
driver, because I think

367
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,263
it comes down to something

368
00:14:40,263 --> 00:14:42,361
that I've been trying to unpack myself,

369
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:45,323
I think the reason that's
true, is because I think

370
00:14:45,323 --> 00:14:47,990
I'm gonna end up being all-time.

371
00:14:49,817 --> 00:14:53,303
I just don't think I need it, and I think

372
00:14:53,303 --> 00:14:57,051
every time I take it,
it just slows it down.

373
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:59,230
So here's what I mean by that.

374
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,863
If you're thinking super-duper
long time, and long term,

375
00:15:02,863 --> 00:15:06,172
well then, when you look at
who you surround yourself with

376
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,282
what shows you're gonna
do, what merch you put out,

377
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,899
what's your next song's title,
what project you're doing,

378
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:12,830
who you're fucking with,
what meetings you're taking,

379
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,594
who you marry, how you roll,

380
00:15:15,594 --> 00:15:18,429
you look at it in one
perspective, which is,

381
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:21,977
when I'm 87, how the fuck
am I gonna feel about this?

382
00:15:21,977 --> 00:15:24,875
And if you're that in tune with yourself,

383
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,254
and I don't know if everybody is or isn't,

384
00:15:26,254 --> 00:15:29,506
I can't speak to that, but
I can give you the answer

385
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:32,336
to why I've gotten here, and
how I've gone about doing it

386
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:34,736
which is, it's all long-term.

387
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:36,925
Boyd's long term, for me.

388
00:15:36,925 --> 00:15:39,327
And I've poured a lot of
dollars, and energy, and efforts

389
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:41,093
into different fuckin' cockamanian things

390
00:15:41,093 --> 00:15:43,722
that Boyd and I have come up with,

391
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:46,586
it's not like he's my
child, Boyd and I, like

392
00:15:46,586 --> 00:15:50,643
because I always knew how
to macro, it was right,

393
00:15:50,643 --> 00:15:53,810
and so, I just always think long-term,

394
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:59,475
because I don't need anything short-term.

395
00:15:59,475 --> 00:16:02,943
And that's it, so like, you
need to start making decisions

396
00:16:02,943 --> 00:16:06,820
on, you know, how you think
about those two things.

397
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,679
It's just legacy and currency.

398
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:11,681
It's just money, and how you feel.

399
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:14,665
And everybody gives up how
they feel for short term money

400
00:16:14,665 --> 00:16:18,252
and then they try to reconstruct it later.

401
00:16:18,252 --> 00:16:21,684
Problem is, everything's on the record.

402
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:22,517
- Yeah.

403
00:16:22,517 --> 00:16:26,580
- We know Jay-Z did a
Budweiser commercial.

404
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,706
That's it.

405
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:31,173
So that's it, man, and I
think the key for me, is

406
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:32,625
I've never wavered.

407
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,235
From when nobody knew who I was,

408
00:16:34,235 --> 00:16:36,738
to a lot more people
now who know who I am,

409
00:16:36,738 --> 00:16:39,856
just the same shit, every day, for ever.

410
00:16:39,856 --> 00:16:41,261
And I know, forever.

411
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:42,753
I love when people are like, oh,

412
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,750
especially my closest friends
and everybody now, like

413
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,849
"Man, it's getting so weird,
I hope you don't change,"

414
00:16:47,849 --> 00:16:51,669
I'm like, you haven't figured
out what I'm doing here.

415
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:54,961
So I think that's super simple,
you just gotta figure out

416
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:57,455
you just gotta build
yourself, now, by the way

417
00:16:57,455 --> 00:16:58,676
some people want a car,

418
00:16:58,676 --> 00:17:01,664
some people want to put their
mom in a penthouse, like

419
00:17:01,664 --> 00:17:03,657
you're you, but understand this,

420
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:05,784
every time you pick the money,

421
00:17:05,784 --> 00:17:09,138
you're taking a couple of
petals out of the legacy place.

422
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:11,415
- Right.
- The end.

423
00:17:11,415 --> 00:17:14,582
- But how do you reconcile
that with short term needs,

424
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,487
like you said,
- I get it.

425
00:17:16,487 --> 00:17:18,737
By understanding the score.

426
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,196
Just understanding the score,
just knowing that truth.

427
00:17:23,196 --> 00:17:27,005
I've taken it, I bought an
apartment on the Upper East Side

428
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:28,268
which made me less liquid,

429
00:17:28,268 --> 00:17:30,327
which didn't allow me to put
as much money into Facebook

430
00:17:30,327 --> 00:17:31,821
and Uber, and Twitter,

431
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:33,435
and I lost hundreds of millions of dollars

432
00:17:33,435 --> 00:17:35,499
because I needed a million
dollars for an apartment,

433
00:17:35,499 --> 00:17:37,082
that was a mistake.

434
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:38,871
Right?

435
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:41,861
Like, right now, I really want
to help my family business

436
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,074
so I'm pushing wine on my social media,

437
00:17:44,074 --> 00:17:47,705
and I'm throwing right
hooks, that's taking away,

438
00:17:47,705 --> 00:17:50,012
because, for the last 18
months I've had the luxury

439
00:17:50,012 --> 00:17:52,527
of just giving at scale.

440
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:54,310
Just knowing the score, right?

441
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,408
I feel great about helping
out my dad's business.

442
00:17:57,408 --> 00:18:00,056
At the expense of me
losing people's attention

443
00:18:00,056 --> 00:18:02,551
because they don't wanna hear about wine.

444
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:04,730
I'm cool with that.

445
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,563
- But you can afford that,

446
00:18:05,563 --> 00:18:06,986
not everybody can afford that, right?

447
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:10,046
- I don't think so, like,
I think I can't afford it,

448
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:14,088
I'm fuckin' pissed about
giving up leverage.

449
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:15,745
Do you understand?

450
00:18:15,745 --> 00:18:18,126
It's binary, I can afford it

451
00:18:18,126 --> 00:18:20,036
if you decide that I have dollars,

452
00:18:20,036 --> 00:18:23,426
but that's not what I'm trading for,

453
00:18:23,426 --> 00:18:25,170
shit's not even benefiting me,

454
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,599
so it's double fucking annoying, you know?

455
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,428
It'd be one thing if it was,
like, you know what I mean?

456
00:18:29,428 --> 00:18:32,845
So you're either giving or you're taking.

457
00:18:35,024 --> 00:18:36,414
There's no between,

458
00:18:36,414 --> 00:18:39,265
and I just try to give
as much as possible,

459
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:42,212
that's why, I know a lot of
people in this community,

460
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:44,006
I know people are gonna watch us right now

461
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:44,839
and everybody's yelling
at me, like "You're giving

462
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,654
"the same advice, of putting out music,

463
00:18:46,654 --> 00:18:49,054
"too much music," I'm
like, you don't get it

464
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:53,221
like, putting out a song is
giving, it's fuckin' free.

465
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:55,912
This isn't how I grew up

466
00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:57,320
and you're putting out a fuckin' tape,

467
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,885
double sided, two songs, and you want $4,

468
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:02,623
it's out of the back of your trunk,

469
00:19:02,623 --> 00:19:04,736
this is you uploading shit
to a streaming service

470
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:06,532
that everybody's getting for fuckin' free,

471
00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:09,214
I mean, macro, $9, whatever, but free.

472
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:12,514
And you're giving me
three minutes of escapism

473
00:19:12,514 --> 00:19:16,335
and you may say something that
inspires me to do something

474
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:17,676
and it may benefit you because

475
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:19,117
you might be that one song away,

476
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:22,020
just like Logic finally had his song,

477
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,802
puts him in a totally different place.

478
00:19:24,802 --> 00:19:27,219
So, giving, that's what I do,

479
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:30,348
I put out a song for free every day,

480
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:32,326
it's called fuckin' DailyVee.
(laughing)

481
00:19:32,326 --> 00:19:33,935
Like, I don't have the
same skills you have,

482
00:19:33,935 --> 00:19:37,538
I have my own version,
and it costs nothing.

483
00:19:37,538 --> 00:19:39,180
So when people are like, "Oh, Gary, but

484
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,475
"you don't know the music
business," I'm like,

485
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:43,360
I know the attention business,
which trumps everything

486
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,551
and I'm doing my, I'm
eating my own dogfood.

487
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:49,342
I'm getting high on my supply.

488
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:52,434
I'm doing what I'm telling people to do.

489
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:56,775
I'm putting shit out every
day, music every day.

490
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:58,385
I believe in it the most.

491
00:19:58,385 --> 00:20:00,616
I will be proven to be right in 15 years,

492
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,681
when everyone's like, "Fuck,
it was music every day."

493
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:04,855
The problem is,

494
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:08,159
are you good enough to
put out music every day?

495
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,768
Like, plenty of people
could be vlogging every day,

496
00:20:09,768 --> 00:20:10,686
nobody gives a fuck
because they were worth

497
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:12,269
three fuckin' days.

498
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,917
But if you think you're work fuckin'

499
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:19,083
365 days a year of songs,
I would highly recommend

500
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,457
that you and your crew
here, think long and hard

501
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:24,709
of how to do that in a strategic way.

502
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:28,081
Now, you may say I have
81 songs a year, or 6,

503
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:29,403
that's on you.

504
00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:31,031
But I would tell you as an artist,

505
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:32,468
the number one advice I have for you,

506
00:20:32,468 --> 00:20:34,599
and every single artist watching,

507
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:38,316
is, figure out how many
songs a year you have in you.

508
00:20:38,316 --> 00:20:40,518
Because once you figure that out,

509
00:20:40,518 --> 00:20:42,261
then you put your strategy around that,

510
00:20:42,261 --> 00:20:44,005
and then you fuckin' win.

511
00:20:44,005 --> 00:20:44,838
Because if you're like, "Look, I got

512
00:20:44,838 --> 00:20:47,412
"eight songs a year in
me, eight fuckin' songs!"

513
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,969
and everybody's gonna
figure out how many bangers

514
00:20:48,969 --> 00:20:53,447
versus volume, I understand
what everyone's debating.

515
00:20:53,447 --> 00:20:56,263
If it's eight, well then go
sign a fuckin' record deal

516
00:20:56,263 --> 00:20:58,355
and then make the most
money you can on eight.

517
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,989
But if you've got 96 in
you, you better just fuckin'

518
00:21:00,989 --> 00:21:05,072
build attention at scale,
and build the leverage.

519
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,442
- 96 makes a lot of stupid bars.

520
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:10,189
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

521
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:11,349
- Because that's what I'm doing.

522
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:12,257
The reason not everybody
can do what I'm doing

523
00:21:12,257 --> 00:21:14,233
in the business, everybody wants to,

524
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,931
is they don't have as much
content I them as I do.

525
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:19,264
- Yeah, right.
- Got it?

526
00:21:19,264 --> 00:21:21,440
That's the 2.0 of what
I've been trying to say,

527
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,301
I'm glad I finally said it,
which is gonna be good for you

528
00:21:23,301 --> 00:21:24,537
because a lot more people
are gonna watch this,

529
00:21:24,537 --> 00:21:26,284
(laughing)

530
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:29,455
now that I finally got off
what I've been trying to say.

531
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,885
That would be the number one
strategy, first, you know?

532
00:21:31,885 --> 00:21:34,335
People overthink projects,
signing, not signing,

533
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,634
number one binary, if you're an artist,

534
00:21:36,634 --> 00:21:39,263
how many great songs, good songs, songs,

535
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:40,690
can I put out a year?

536
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,750
And do I have the energy for it?

537
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,277
And how do I do it?

538
00:21:44,277 --> 00:21:48,080
And can I afford it, and am
I in it, and how do I do it?

539
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,838
But, that would be the
biggest piece of advice,

540
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:51,732
and then the first part
of this meeting, man

541
00:21:51,732 --> 00:21:53,109
legacy, currency.

542
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:55,857
When you ask, you're giving up leverage,

543
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:57,582
when you're giving,
you're gaining leverage

544
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:00,699
and balancing that with your
audience, is everything.

545
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:03,113
It's why I'm loved,
because I'm fucking, giving

546
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,324
more than I'm taking.
- Right.

547
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,007
I think that's also just your story.

548
00:22:08,007 --> 00:22:11,379
- Even, 100%, because we're
used to not having anything,

549
00:22:11,379 --> 00:22:14,710
my kids have no shot,
they're used to having stuff.

550
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,928
They're used to having stuff,
so the thought of not, like

551
00:22:17,928 --> 00:22:20,809
to me, people don't get
it, I can go back to zero,

552
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:24,099
I'm like Rocky in that
sixth movie, like, I'm good.

553
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:26,144
I'll go right back to fuckin' Rego Park

554
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:28,141
live in a studio
apartment, go to Waldbaums

555
00:22:28,141 --> 00:22:30,435
and be good, dreaming up
how I'm gonna come back

556
00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:32,533
and fuckin', rise like a phoenix, right?

557
00:22:32,533 --> 00:22:34,645
And be like, and read every
fucking comment of like

558
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,823
"I knew Gary V. Was a
fraud, I knew he sucked,

559
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:39,707
"I knew he'd fall one day,"
and just fuckin' eat that shit

560
00:22:39,707 --> 00:22:42,117
to motivate myself to get
back up, and come back

561
00:22:42,117 --> 00:22:43,814
and be like, I fuckin' told you, so like,

562
00:22:43,814 --> 00:22:46,411
to me, it's equally as
interesting to go back to zero

563
00:22:46,411 --> 00:22:48,356
as it is to go to fuckin' hero,

564
00:22:48,356 --> 00:22:50,319
and that means you're unbeatable,

565
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:53,584
and that's why immigrants win,
because once you taste it,

566
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:55,560
you don't wanna go back,
because you're like, fuck

567
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,733
that sucked, this is better,

568
00:22:57,733 --> 00:23:00,156
but you're not completely petrified of it

569
00:23:00,156 --> 00:23:02,469
because you've been there, done that.

570
00:23:02,469 --> 00:23:03,944
- [Kaz] And you know how to get back,

571
00:23:03,944 --> 00:23:05,738
if not with better tools at your disposal.

572
00:23:05,738 --> 00:23:08,408
- 100%, I've done it
once, I can do it again.

573
00:23:08,408 --> 00:23:10,333
Which then allows you to take the risks,

574
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:12,593
which then allows you to give,

575
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:15,697
because when you suck, you're taking.

576
00:23:15,697 --> 00:23:16,530
- Yeah.

577
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,230
- [Boyd] Yeah and one thing to quickly

578
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,409
add some context, I was
hanging around with Gary

579
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:22,823
I was talking about, like, if
you have eight songs a year

580
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:25,036
and you make your plan
around it, another thing

581
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:28,508
well, one thing Gary
always says, and I know

582
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:29,686
you watch a lot of Gary's stuff, so like,

583
00:23:29,686 --> 00:23:31,864
when Gary talks about,
like, attention stuff,

584
00:23:31,864 --> 00:23:34,192
he just told, A-Boogie
for example, like you know

585
00:23:34,192 --> 00:23:36,803
if there's a song, and it's not taking off

586
00:23:36,803 --> 00:23:38,368
and you want it to get hotter, like

587
00:23:38,368 --> 00:23:40,194
why don't you go to the
Bronx, or why don't just

588
00:23:40,194 --> 00:23:41,496
tell your fans to meet you
somewhere, or your case,

589
00:23:41,496 --> 00:23:43,575
like, go somewhere in Queens, or something

590
00:23:43,575 --> 00:23:44,982
and like, create this content

591
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:46,492
because, like, if you do,

592
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:48,469
because one thing for you to know, Gary,

593
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:49,978
because, I was talking to Anik,

594
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:51,285
and unlike a lot of you guys in Atlanta,

595
00:23:51,285 --> 00:23:53,067
who just, like live in the studio

596
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:54,001
he was telling me that he kind of just

597
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:56,046
goes in the studio for
like, two weeks at a time,

598
00:23:56,046 --> 00:23:57,688
and it's like crunch
time, or not crunch time,

599
00:23:57,688 --> 00:23:59,798
but when he's inspired to
like, create a project,

600
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:00,631
- I get it.

601
00:24:00,631 --> 00:24:02,578
- [Boyd] Given that
knowledge, it's almost like

602
00:24:02,578 --> 00:24:04,460
if you just create a lot of video content

603
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,614
and all that other stuff,

604
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:08,900
as long as you're keeping
people's attention,

605
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,428
it could still work, you know

606
00:24:10,428 --> 00:24:13,378
like, whatever number of
songs you come out with,

607
00:24:13,378 --> 00:24:18,186
- Boyd, seeing A-Boogie do
that pop up the other day

608
00:24:18,186 --> 00:24:20,603
made me smile cheek to cheek.

609
00:24:22,121 --> 00:24:23,914
- Yeah, that was insane,
that really worked for him.

610
00:24:23,914 --> 00:24:25,255
- No shit!

611
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:28,406
Because I'm right about this stuff!

612
00:24:28,406 --> 00:24:30,369
Because if you give, you get!

613
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:33,533
- When I saw that, I
actually, when we went to LA,

614
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:35,949
it really was like my first
time, because I stayed

615
00:24:35,949 --> 00:24:37,611
for like, a while, like for six days,

616
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:39,622
and I didn't know,
like, I knew I had fans,

617
00:24:39,622 --> 00:24:42,491
but the show was already sold
out before I got in the door

618
00:24:42,491 --> 00:24:45,520
like, and so, I said we should
just pop up for my merch

619
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,150
and we just picked the
place, it was like yo,

620
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,417
and attire, shit, I couldn't stop moving.

621
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:54,000
- I get it man, it's
the best feeling ever.

622
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:58,850
- Doing that, I feel like, and
I've heard you say it before

623
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,806
that's the most important part
- 100%

624
00:25:02,806 --> 00:25:06,123
- Talking to them, personally
and giving them something

625
00:25:06,123 --> 00:25:08,351
personally, to have, they talk about that.

626
00:25:08,351 --> 00:25:10,114
- Depth.
- All, everywhere.

627
00:25:10,114 --> 00:25:12,581
That shit spreads.
- Everybody wants width.

628
00:25:12,581 --> 00:25:15,243
Everybody wants a million
followers, but I'll take 1,000

629
00:25:15,243 --> 00:25:17,355
if every one of them does
what I want them to do,

630
00:25:17,355 --> 00:25:19,467
and gets what they want out of it.

631
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:20,300
- Yeah.

632
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,463
- It's 100%, and engagement
isn't likes, or shares

633
00:25:23,463 --> 00:25:27,235
engagement's going to shows,
or wearing a menu on your shirt

634
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:30,472
or taking their time to
tell their friends, like

635
00:25:30,472 --> 00:25:34,078
"You need to listen to
this person's stuff!"

636
00:25:34,078 --> 00:25:36,223
- Yeah, that's the goal.

637
00:25:36,223 --> 00:25:37,411
- I think you need to give,

638
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,073
now that Boyd just put that
context, of the studio,

639
00:25:39,073 --> 00:25:40,781
I'm telling you right now brother,

640
00:25:40,781 --> 00:25:43,512
please think about how
many songs you have in you.

641
00:25:43,512 --> 00:25:45,122
And it may not come easy,
you've maybe never thought of it

642
00:25:45,122 --> 00:25:48,287
like, you need to go inside
yourself and figure that out.

643
00:25:48,287 --> 00:25:49,667
- Right.

644
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,376
- Once you have that figured out,

645
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:53,268
I'm telling you, that's the new blueprint.

646
00:25:53,268 --> 00:25:54,101
- Okay.

647
00:25:54,101 --> 00:25:56,204
- Once you understand that, then you can,

648
00:25:56,204 --> 00:25:58,603
because there's a lot of,
everybody's doing the same shit

649
00:25:58,603 --> 00:26:00,983
everybody put out fuckin'
albums, then everybody put out

650
00:26:00,983 --> 00:26:03,493
45s, back in the day, then
everybody put out albums

651
00:26:03,493 --> 00:26:06,127
now everybody's putting
out music on the internet,

652
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:08,033
mixtapes, "projects", right?
(laughing)

653
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:11,639
I'm like, look, if you
have 150 songs in you,

654
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:14,772
not everyone can be in your next project,

655
00:26:14,772 --> 00:26:16,400
then take 13 of them,

656
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,241
and give them to the
biggest bloggers on YouTube.

657
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:24,039
Be like, "Yo, I made this for
you, Paul Brothers, here!"

658
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:26,651
Like, that's your ammo!

659
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:30,238
And overthinking the
distribution to fit the box

660
00:26:30,238 --> 00:26:32,942
that everybody's doing,
is the way not to do it.

661
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:34,597
Like, somebody here needs to email

662
00:26:34,597 --> 00:26:36,543
every video game company, and be like,

663
00:26:36,543 --> 00:26:39,862
we have a great artist, we
have real fuckin' beats,

664
00:26:39,862 --> 00:26:41,836
fire, like, we'll give em' to you,

665
00:26:41,836 --> 00:26:45,715
just put em' in the pre-role of the game,

666
00:26:45,715 --> 00:26:48,248
or anywhere else people's attention is.

667
00:26:48,248 --> 00:26:50,608
Hit up a fuckin' college
that has a big radio station

668
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:55,288
and be like, "Duke University,
we're giving this to you."

669
00:26:55,288 --> 00:26:57,112
Like, opening lines, "Yo, Duke, what up?"

670
00:26:57,112 --> 00:26:57,945
Go, you!

671
00:27:00,082 --> 00:27:01,806
Because you have that song in you!

672
00:27:01,806 --> 00:27:03,415
And what are you gonna
sit and scrutinize it,

673
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:04,921
and cut it from the project
at the end, so what?

674
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:07,586
It's gonna sit in fuckin',
somebody's harddrive?

675
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:08,419
- Right.

676
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,020
- The fuck?
- Yeah.

677
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,687
- Execution.
- Right.

678
00:27:12,615 --> 00:27:16,322
- Take every fuckin', back
to legacy vs currency.

679
00:27:16,322 --> 00:27:18,079
I build Wine Library into
big business, because

680
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,735
when I built it from a three,
I'm looking at the plaque

681
00:27:19,735 --> 00:27:21,734
with me and my dad, because when it went

682
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:25,656
from three to 45, it went
up three to 45, because

683
00:27:25,656 --> 00:27:27,630
much like every other
liquor store in New Jersey

684
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,410
owned by Indian families, who were all my,

685
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,336
- You're from Princeton, right?

686
00:27:31,336 --> 00:27:35,088
- Dude, my relationship with
the Indian community is crazy.

687
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:37,954
Edison, New Jersey, literally in 1986,

688
00:27:37,954 --> 00:27:40,287
is where everybody came, Iselin and Edison

689
00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:42,933
my dad owns the only building in Iselin

690
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:44,592
not owned by an Indian-American.

691
00:27:44,592 --> 00:27:46,182
(laughing)
The only one.

692
00:27:46,182 --> 00:27:47,688
- He recorded the project in Edison

693
00:27:47,688 --> 00:27:50,055
- First of all, I didn't
know Indian people

694
00:27:50,055 --> 00:27:51,982
lived in Edison, so
- Oh dude, it's crazy.

695
00:27:51,982 --> 00:27:53,974
You must have been like, what?

696
00:27:53,974 --> 00:27:55,449
- Like, what the fuck is going on?

697
00:27:55,449 --> 00:27:57,460
- Dude, it's India, when
you get in there, really.

698
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,558
- I got through miles of Indian
businesses, and I was like

699
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:02,091
this is like Utopia of India.

700
00:28:02,091 --> 00:28:03,763
- Did I leave a phone in here?

701
00:28:03,763 --> 00:28:05,942
- Is this you?
- Yeah that's me.

702
00:28:05,942 --> 00:28:08,192
(laughing)

703
00:28:10,865 --> 00:28:13,394
- So, you know, I'm the "immigrant"

704
00:28:13,394 --> 00:28:16,024
in Edison, New Jersey,
from '82 to '86, in Edison

705
00:28:16,024 --> 00:28:19,545
because I'm "the Russian kid",
and then one summer goes by

706
00:28:19,545 --> 00:28:22,262
and we go into fifth
grade, '82, '3, '4, '5,

707
00:28:22,262 --> 00:28:26,550
in 1986, four new kids in my
class have the last name Patel

708
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,872
seven of them are from
India, and I'm pumped

709
00:28:29,872 --> 00:28:33,211
because I'm like, okay
good, new immigrants, right?

710
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,586
What I didn't know is that

711
00:28:34,586 --> 00:28:35,858
they were really gonna be my homies,

712
00:28:35,858 --> 00:28:37,369
cause' these kids were like
me, they were here to fuckin'

713
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:40,252
sell shit, flip baseball
cards, make money, like, grind

714
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:42,866
so, it went from, first I like it cause'

715
00:28:42,866 --> 00:28:44,056
I wasn't gonna be the only odd-man out,

716
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,752
then I was like, wait a
minute, these are my homies,

717
00:28:46,752 --> 00:28:48,585
so then, that's my first chapter,

718
00:28:48,585 --> 00:28:52,857
then I go into the
liquor business in 1998.

719
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:57,024
From 1992 to 2015, all of
New Jersey's liquor stores,

720
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:01,819
80% of them were bought by
Indian-American immigrants.

721
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:03,867
The whole industry is owned,
because they're hustlers

722
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,759
and they made their thing.

723
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,319
Cool, all that's cool, now
I'm there, then I go into tech

724
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,679
(laughing)
and start meeting all these

725
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:12,352
developers, and they're
all like, "So, yeah,"

726
00:29:12,352 --> 00:29:15,981
I've always had, like, I've
always had a pretty amazing

727
00:29:15,981 --> 00:29:17,893
relationship with the community,

728
00:29:17,893 --> 00:29:22,486
because I'm built like
that community, and listen

729
00:29:22,486 --> 00:29:24,296
I think a lot about the hip hop,

730
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:26,811
African-American communities,
it's just the same shit

731
00:29:26,811 --> 00:29:29,560
which is, when you don't have anything,

732
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,113
and you're willing to work.
- Yeah man.

733
00:29:33,113 --> 00:29:34,756
- The way you leverage it, is first of all

734
00:29:34,756 --> 00:29:36,130
you don't have to do anything,

735
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:39,751
because the truth always
wins, you're part of it.

736
00:29:39,751 --> 00:29:41,346
It's naturally gonna come to you.

737
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:44,430
You wanna speed it up,
there's a very easy way.

738
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,905
It's called Facebook.

739
00:29:45,905 --> 00:29:47,045
(murmuring agreement)

740
00:29:47,045 --> 00:29:49,522
- I think that's my biggest
gift, even though like,

741
00:29:49,522 --> 00:29:51,958
whilst I was going through
it, I didn't think so, like

742
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:54,621
even though, like, I
would say I'm an immigrant

743
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:56,149
but even more than that,

744
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:58,476
I grew up in lower income apartments,

745
00:29:58,476 --> 00:30:01,220
so I wasn't around Bengalese, right?

746
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:05,095
I was around African-Americans,
and Hispanics,

747
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,475
- That's how you ended up here.

748
00:30:06,475 --> 00:30:09,712
- Right, because I
understand the perspective

749
00:30:09,712 --> 00:30:12,049
of what they're coming
from, but I also still

750
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:14,242
know my heritage, and what I'm doing,

751
00:30:14,242 --> 00:30:16,004
and it's just that balance of both.

752
00:30:16,004 --> 00:30:17,921
- It's such a home run.

753
00:30:20,042 --> 00:30:22,956
I wish I'd never left Queens, I mean it.

754
00:30:22,956 --> 00:30:24,012
- You could come back, man.

755
00:30:24,012 --> 00:30:25,487
(laughing)

756
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:26,861
- You know what's crazy, I got real lucky

757
00:30:26,861 --> 00:30:31,028
we moved to, basically, a
very lower-middle class, white

758
00:30:32,489 --> 00:30:34,655
neighborhood, for my highschool,
like, it's crazy, like

759
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:37,555
I'd never been around
wealth my whole life.

760
00:30:37,555 --> 00:30:39,517
It's the best thing that
ever happened to me.

761
00:30:39,517 --> 00:30:41,564
- Yeah, people ask me, "Why
you so close to your family?"

762
00:30:41,564 --> 00:30:42,397
I say, cause' I never had shit.

763
00:30:42,397 --> 00:30:44,283
- I get it.
- All we have is each other.

764
00:30:44,283 --> 00:30:46,123
- 100%, man, I'm the same way, I get it.

765
00:30:46,123 --> 00:30:49,428
Tell your true stories,
man, they're universal.

766
00:30:49,428 --> 00:30:52,981
It's not Indian, or Russian,
or black, it's universal.

767
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:55,960
These stories are universal.

768
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,118
It's just the same stories
with a different coat of paint.

769
00:31:00,118 --> 00:31:01,035
- Yeah, man.

770
00:31:01,035 --> 00:31:04,658
- There's only two stories,
the haves, and the have-nots

771
00:31:04,658 --> 00:31:08,753
(mouth clicking)
That's it.

772
00:31:08,753 --> 00:31:10,664
You gotta figure out how much
music you have in you, man.

773
00:31:10,664 --> 00:31:12,623
That's the best piece of
advice I can give you.

774
00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:14,083
- Okay.
- That will help you.

775
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:16,085
Because, if you, and I don't know

776
00:31:16,085 --> 00:31:17,656
maybe, you know, like, again

777
00:31:17,656 --> 00:31:20,688
- I'm definitely not the 65 songs,

778
00:31:20,688 --> 00:31:22,448
and I know that about myself.

779
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:23,590
- You know what, that's great.

780
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,591
Even though my vibes go
towards the 365 songs,

781
00:31:27,591 --> 00:31:31,758
like, if it's fuckin' 16,
you could be smart then.

782
00:31:34,088 --> 00:31:35,778
That gets into your team
gettin' together, like

783
00:31:35,778 --> 00:31:38,814
honestly, even just this
team, I think that's helpful

784
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,994
I don't know how much
pressure you guys have put

785
00:31:40,994 --> 00:31:42,349
on this conversation, but if I know

786
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:44,260
that you're saying it's 12,

787
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,104
you guys need to take a
real step back, and be like,

788
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:49,816
okay, we need to strategize
around projects in a different,

789
00:31:49,816 --> 00:31:53,743
if you can launch four projects
a year, or once a week songs

790
00:31:53,743 --> 00:31:56,420
versus having one project a year,

791
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,702
you have a totally
different fuckin' 365 days.

792
00:31:59,702 --> 00:32:01,396
- Yeah, that's what we just actually,

793
00:32:01,396 --> 00:32:02,670
I don't know if you heard

794
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,145
of an Indian streaming company, Saavn?

795
00:32:04,145 --> 00:32:04,978
- I'm sorry?

796
00:32:04,978 --> 00:32:06,536
- The Indian streaming
service company, Saavn.

797
00:32:06,536 --> 00:32:07,369
- I'm aware.

798
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:09,553
- So, because we, you now, I know that

799
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:13,150
I don't make music like that,
I still wanna push Kites

800
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:16,158
and the project, we're
partnering with them

801
00:32:16,158 --> 00:32:18,265
to figure out more video
content, and more things.

802
00:32:18,265 --> 00:32:20,870
- 100%.
- Like, do them together.

803
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:21,828
- Do you write?

804
00:32:21,828 --> 00:32:23,171
- Yeah.
- How often?

805
00:32:23,171 --> 00:32:25,216
- Write it down?
- Yeah, like how do you do,

806
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:26,504
do you write your music?
- Yeah.

807
00:32:26,504 --> 00:32:27,610
Yeah, I write all my music.

808
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,234
- Good, how do you write?

809
00:32:29,234 --> 00:32:30,647
- Like, when I'm driving,

810
00:32:30,647 --> 00:32:33,075
- So, it's there, and
then you just go improv?

811
00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:34,583
- And I go into the studio,

812
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,392
- Spit it from the dome?

813
00:32:36,392 --> 00:32:38,622
- Well, I'll write in the studio as well,

814
00:32:38,622 --> 00:32:39,947
just in my head, where I'm like,

815
00:32:39,947 --> 00:32:41,504
- I still think nobody's figured out,

816
00:32:41,504 --> 00:32:43,247
I think somebody needs to be documenting

817
00:32:43,247 --> 00:32:45,694
the entire writing process.

818
00:32:45,694 --> 00:32:48,089
- Oh right, wow, that'd be really cool.

819
00:32:48,089 --> 00:32:51,561
- If I could see how the 15
songs that I love the most

820
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:54,760
origin stories, why do
you think comic books win?

821
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,558
Comic books win because
we know Spider Man got bit

822
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:01,197
by a fuckin', spider,
like, we're like, oh shit!

823
00:33:01,197 --> 00:33:05,018
Origin stories, I think,
are a missing thing.

824
00:33:05,018 --> 00:33:07,585
Like, if I was like, oh
my god, my favorite hook

825
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,463
that you ever came up with, was because

826
00:33:09,463 --> 00:33:12,377
you tripped, like going to Burger King,

827
00:33:12,377 --> 00:33:14,705
and you're like "Damn,
skinned knees, skinned knees"

828
00:33:14,705 --> 00:33:16,469
like, look, I don't know!

829
00:33:16,469 --> 00:33:17,975
- We talk about that all the time.

830
00:33:17,975 --> 00:33:19,366
- Well generally, because they
don't really talk about that

831
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:20,917
because, we have all
these great content ideas,

832
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:24,032
but then I feel that,
because this media industry

833
00:33:24,032 --> 00:33:26,698
is so consumed by content, that
they want to make their own

834
00:33:26,698 --> 00:33:28,709
I think that sometimes
we're debilitated because

835
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:31,204
we have to wait until someone
says, like, okay, cool

836
00:33:31,204 --> 00:33:32,851
we'll do that, rather
than just putting it out

837
00:33:32,851 --> 00:33:35,851
- Yeah, I get the complex, I get it,

838
00:33:37,706 --> 00:33:39,569
but I didn't wait for Wall Street Journal,

839
00:33:39,569 --> 00:33:42,228
or Fortune, or Forbes to put me on.

840
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:44,143
You have something called YouTube,

841
00:33:44,143 --> 00:33:46,068
and Facebook, and Instagram, and SnapChat,

842
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:48,713
you just need, right now,
the fact that you have fans,

843
00:33:48,713 --> 00:33:50,915
somebody will work for free, to be Tyler,

844
00:33:50,915 --> 00:33:53,548
follow you around with a
camera, he's 17 years old,

845
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:55,158
he loves your music the most in the world,

846
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,647
he's got nothing else going on,

847
00:33:56,647 --> 00:33:58,659
and he's gonna follow you around for free,

848
00:33:58,659 --> 00:34:00,181
and that's that.
(laughing)

849
00:34:00,181 --> 00:34:03,131
- We're literally interviewing
him in three hours.

850
00:34:03,131 --> 00:34:05,061
- That's it, that's the game.

851
00:34:05,061 --> 00:34:07,039
- I got something for you, man
- Please.

852
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,208
- Let me actually get it now.

853
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:10,706
So, these are the different colors.

854
00:34:10,706 --> 00:34:14,447
- I can't wait to listen, man, thank you.

855
00:34:14,447 --> 00:34:15,721
I love it, I'm gonna rock em'.

856
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:17,652
You know what, though, cause'
I'm really gonna rock em',

857
00:34:17,652 --> 00:34:19,239
can somebody send me mediums,

858
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,784
because I won't wear these largest,

859
00:34:20,784 --> 00:34:22,695
- Oh, no, they're slim fit,

860
00:34:22,695 --> 00:34:23,849
- Tight?
- Yeah.

861
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:25,813
- Got it, great, then
I will 100% rock em'.

862
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:29,232
- They'll fit better at large,
and you'll be hugged up.

863
00:34:29,232 --> 00:34:31,866
- Perfect, got it, perfect.

864
00:34:31,866 --> 00:34:33,106
I love it, I need to run,

865
00:34:33,106 --> 00:34:34,681
because I got my dad's charity wine event,

866
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:35,514
- Absolutely.

867
00:34:35,514 --> 00:34:37,287
But I'd love to take some photos.

868
00:34:37,288 --> 00:34:39,059
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Put you on a little bit.

869
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:40,367
- That'd be awesome, man.

870
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:43,413
- What's going on on your
Instagram, how's it going?

871
00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:45,170
What is your Instagram, let me follow you.

872
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,083
- AnikKhan_,

873
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,416
A N I K K H A N,

874
00:34:50,036 --> 00:34:53,695
- It's one word?
- Yep, underscore at the end.

875
00:34:53,695 --> 00:34:55,362
- I see it, love it.

876
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:57,782
Followed.

877
00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:04,775
You need to post way more often.

878
00:35:04,775 --> 00:35:07,188
- Thank you!
(laughing)

879
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,937
- Look, I'm on the thing every day.

880
00:35:09,937 --> 00:35:11,603
- Time to go.

881
00:35:11,603 --> 00:35:13,515
- Every day, my phone's just broke.

882
00:35:13,515 --> 00:35:15,764
Every day.
- Okay.

883
00:35:15,764 --> 00:35:16,814
- Every day.

884
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,007
The biggest thing, I'm gonna tell you,

885
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:21,333
I can feel it already, if
you're precious, you'll lose.

886
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:23,000
- Right, damn, okay.

887
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,303
- Dude, I told you,

888
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:26,591
the first time we ever met about music.

889
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,064
- Imma' fight you when we get outside.

890
00:35:28,064 --> 00:35:29,303
(laughing)

891
00:35:29,303 --> 00:35:30,136
- You know what I mean?

892
00:35:30,136 --> 00:35:32,546
I get it, but I'm telling
you with all my heart.

893
00:35:32,546 --> 00:35:34,461
I want you to win, if
you're precious you'll lose.

894
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:35,855
- Okay.

895
00:35:35,855 --> 00:35:37,780
- The amount of real
talents that are losing

896
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,995
out of preciousness, and then it's over.

897
00:35:40,995 --> 00:35:42,392
- Right.

898
00:35:42,392 --> 00:00:00,000
