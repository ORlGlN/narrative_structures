many different accounts on many

6
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:09,780
different social platforms and my

7
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,400
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you today is do you believe</font>

8
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,290
creating my own website with valuable

9
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,269
original content to drive traffic to is

10
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:17,130
a reasonable investment for long-term

11
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,020
branding or do you believe that websites

12
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,369
are going to be irrelevant eventually

13
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:21,720
with this mobile revolution that's

14
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,980
happening should<font color="#CCCCCC"> I be looking more into</font>

15
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,630
app development or something that I'm

16
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,320
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even looking at let me know thanks I</font>

17
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,369
think it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good question a lot</font>

18
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:31,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">of people are struggling with I will say</font>

19
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,660
this you know I have Gary Vaynerchuk

20
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">calm oh no you can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look it out</font>

21
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,730
lengthen anyway I've Gary ownership calm

22
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,829
for a reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> not for kicks and giggles I</font>

23
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,420
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a platform that I</font>

24
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,510
fundamentally<font color="#E5E5E5"> control all aspects of and</font>

25
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,789
so you know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're building brand</font>

26
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,170
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter with a bunch of Twitter</font>

27
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,910
accounts like you are like I am when

28
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,350
you're building a facebook fan page you

29
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,510
know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook themes for itself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

30
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,670
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> its audience and for you believe it</font>

31
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">or not that they need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to drop down</font>

32
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,300
organic reach and everything you're

33
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,920
putting out is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> being delivered you</font>

34
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,210
start understanding why having your own

35
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,830
email service having your own website

36
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,320
matters having your own app matters if

37
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">you deem that people are going to spend</font>

38
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,070
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their time within the app then</font>

39
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,430
on a mobile native<font color="#E5E5E5"> website just because</font>

40
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,640
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world's going mobile or risky or or</font>

41
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,310
this you know or virtual reality doesn't

42
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,170
necessarily mean that the website is

43
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,090
gone it's really just a protocol for a

44
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,650
place that you can own<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what I</font>

45
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">would say is philosophically you want to</font>

46
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,630
have your own house but doing business

47
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,240
in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> vacation home or in a hotel also</font>

48
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,340
matter if you understood that analogy

49
00:01:35,340 --> 00:00:00,000
you're on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>
