00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,340
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the wine world right this</font>

47
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,350
is where wine does its thing but in the

48
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">u.s. people are scared of wine they're</font>

49
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,250
intimidated so I started the show

50
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,348
because I wanted people to try new

51
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,750
things and to trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own palate</font>

52
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,770
it's not about Parker

53
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,860
me or wine spectator or tradition I mean

54
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,230
Bordeaux we all love<font color="#E5E5E5"> bored out but</font>

55
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,870
really we're still completely influenced

56
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,190
by something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happened in eighteen</font>

57
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,710
fifty five I mean things change you know

58
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,930
Tara's terroir but you know winemakers

59
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,830
and things change and so my passion is

60
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,810
to get people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trust their own palette</font>

61
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,960
by the way not only in wine but in

62
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,520
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's way too many people</font>

63
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at all the pretty faces in the</font>

64
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,140
crowd I know for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fact in my heart that</font>

65
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,490
ninety-five percent of the people in

66
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">this room don't love what they do one</font>

67
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,900
hundred percent no love<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room well</font>

68
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,270
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in this room love what</font>

69
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,170
they do 100 whoa whoa<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoa one hundred</font>

70
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,070
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you know what you're</font>

71
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,650
wrong twenty percent no VC severe that

72
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,040
was 21 at max that was maybe not okay

73
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,630
one more<font color="#CCCCCC"> time how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what don't</font>

74
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,700
bullshit one hundred percent love what

75
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,850
they do the week that's okay 30 offer I

76
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,950
use that look V seized by the way this

77
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,530
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on camera so I'm sorry this is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font>

78
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,080
fine how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are not one hundred</font>

79
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,980
percent happy raise your hand ten

80
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,280
percent that's not two percent but fine

81
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,110
listen the fact that matter is my hope

82
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,420
is that people recognize how big the

83
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,150
social shift is right now how the cost

84
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,040
of getting involved and building a

85
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,200
business around what you love is so low

86
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,870
lip gonna head up so you guys if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

87
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,400
not if you raise your hand the second

88
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,780
time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just stop what you're doing and</font>

89
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,850
you do what you love that's your point

90
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,410
no because you have to be practical you

91
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,390
have to you know pay the mortgage you

92
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,310
have student loans there's practicality

93
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,230
but the fact of the matter is I don't

94
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,240
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> people not doing what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they love</font>

95
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,010
when they can come home and instead of

96
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,360
at eight o'clock at night or nine

97
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">o'clock at night play Nintendo Wii or</font>

drink six beers or watch lost season two

99
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,670
on DVD I want them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start building a</font>

100
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,170
business around what they love because

101
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,260
the cost is zero<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so tell me how I</font>

102
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,150
do that that's your book right well

launched free shipping<font color="#E5E5E5"> for one day on</font>

daughter's wedding when she was like six

123
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,850
years old it was chaos right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it</font>

wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that everybody was</font>

125

00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,410
dollars a bottle to ship the wine for

128
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,389
and so we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and it became</font>

129
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:04,919
insanity and everybody lost their

130
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:08,400
fucking mind right but what's

131
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,870
interesting is over the course of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

impact everybody's business in this room

147
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,570
is that consumers are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to expect a</font>

148
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,570
far greater level of customer service

after a concert and shake my hand but

182
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're living in a day and age now where</font>

183
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost of entry for us to engage with</font>

184
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,220
everybody is so low that our expectation

185
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,590
is growing what Oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cho</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cinco is doing</font>

186
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,170
what Zappos created in corporate culture

187
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,850
Tony's here that's right it's probably

188
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,740
crushing it somewhere right now you know

189
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,170
what what's starting to happen is our

190
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,080
expectation what I do for wine fans they

191
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,120
didn't expect Robert Parker or Jancis

192
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,130
Robinson or the owner of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chateau Latour</font>

193
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,010
to care or give back or answer their

194
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,020
email I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's starting to change</font>

195
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,440
so you crush it by answering every

196
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,690
single email that guy answers every

197
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,660
single emails I try it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's and you</font>

205
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">was driven by being an immigrant i was</font>

members smaller than that stage so my

210
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,140
whole life I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I was driven</font>

211
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,240
and I was successful because I was an

212
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,770
immigrant because I know what it tastes

213
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,020

216
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,530
I've come to realize recently is that

217
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,530

<font color="#E5E5E5">users they built real businesses and it</font>

286
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,279
took a long time the fact that every

person in this room can use the internet

288
00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:19,269
and build a platform and I don't give a

289
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:20,889

think Tiger Woods is an extreme example

297
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,519
everybody's gonna get called out

298
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,809
everybody nobody's gonna be hiding

299
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:42,339
anywhere because everything's gonna be

300
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:44,199
exposed and the fact that we can all

301
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:47,079
build a real business and the cost of

302
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:49,929
entry is so low I feel bad for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

303
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:51,729

40s who didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that the</font>

305
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,850
entrepreneurs in the 80s who needed a

306
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,529
hundred thousand dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start up a</font>

307
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:58,089
business the fact that you could start a

308
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:00,759
business now create content around that

309

I don't even really care that much about

492
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,490
the internet even though that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> game</font>

493
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,620
if people still looked up in the sky and

there were you worried<font color="#E5E5E5"> because people</font>

500
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,300
read them you know I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact of</font>

501
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,460
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter is is that I'm not romance by</font>

anything but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> message the platforms</font>

503
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,480
that we deliver them<font color="#E5E5E5"> on is irrelevant</font>

504
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,820
which is why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm so passionate and why I</font>

505
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,350
wanted to talk today about customer

506
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,570
service because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm telling you Tony</font>

507
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,030
Hsieh Zappos and then Bezos for being

508
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,490
smart enough to buy them are massively

509
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,909
underrated if you read

510
00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:32,489
I promise you when we look back at it

511
00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:36,249
culture DNA and culture is what wins the

512
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:38,590
game not price in a day and age where

513
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,289
price is so available to us the fact

514
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:43,629
that Zappos was not the cheapest and I

515
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:45,369
hate when people say Zappos was great

516
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:46,869
because they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Twitter what are</font>

517
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:48,940
you talking about it's like going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

518
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,609
Twitter it was corporate culture it was

519
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:53,289
caring more about the consumer than

520
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:55,239
anybody else that to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font>

521
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:56,769
fascinating<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that's something</font>

522
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:58,989
that can be scaled by any<font color="#CCCCCC"> startup</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

523
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,299
the guys who just won this thing stribe

524
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:03,429
they're gonna be great and all that they

525
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:05,049
don't win it unless they give a fuck and

526
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:07,239
the more you care and the more you care

527
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">about your users and the more effort you</font>

528
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:11,049
put into that and don't bullshit it the

529
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:12,639
more upside you have as a company I

530
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:15,129
firmly firmly believe that in a world

00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:17,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">where our word of mouth is so activated</font>

532
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,210
that when you have a good experience or

533
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,340
a bad experience it's gonna travel

534
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,379
dramatically more than three years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago i</font>

00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:25,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference people don't want to do it</font>

564
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,759
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't recognize why it's</font>

565
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,379
valuable to their business because in

00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:31,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">the old days our little individual</font>

567

00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:36,039
starting to change consumer expectation

569
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,869
is starting to change and when it starts

570
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:39,909
ringing up on the radar it's going to
