email is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not dead do you think email</font>

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,529
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more or less relevant in three</font>

4
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:10,950
to five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> Madison great question</font>

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,809
three to five years it's always hard to

6
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:15,150
predict<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way out but I'll get to</font>

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,560
that part<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're actually to answer</font>

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,289
let some people down<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hate letting</font>

15
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,660
people down email is definitely not dead

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,180
i would say that email right now I like

17
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,790
marketing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the year that we live</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in so</font>

18
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,280
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say right now that email is a</font>

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,829
very killer app now our open rates at

20
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,930
ninety percent like I had in 1997

21
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,450
absolutely not but is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it an own channel</font>

22
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,920
that you control and don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be at</font>

23
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,360
the mercy of all these other platforms

24
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,950
that you can market to your people for

25
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,899
sure I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can't be naive to the</font>

26
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,640
fact that Google made changes with Gmail

27
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,379
about a year ago feels like now<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

28
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:56,670
within the year where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to a</font>

29
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,219
promotions tab I see stunwin shaking his

30
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,629
head Steve were you affected by the

31
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:01,920
promotions tab were you part of any

32
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,719
email lists that you noticed went there

33
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,670
oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely now here's the here's</font>

34
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,799
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> punch line question show me punch</font>

35
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,479
line question here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the punch line</font>

36
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,390
question do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that some of those</font>

37
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,130
that got switched to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the promotion tabs</font>

38
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,900
you've actually fallen off because they

39
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,939
don't go to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> native in feed and you</font>

40
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,380
either unsubscribed or you just don't

41
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,030
pay attention to any more totally gone

42
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">yep probably five or six events that's</font>

43
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,970
my concern so what's happening is do I

44
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,470
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> email will matter three to five</font>

45
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,600
years for sure I think it's in play it's

46
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,970
a channel it's not going anywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I</font>

47
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,070
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's dead absolutely not do I</font>

48
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,810
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be more or less valuable as</font>

49
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,939
a marketing engine I will go with less

50
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,430
valuable in three to five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will</font>

51
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,049
still be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> valuable because it's one</font>

52
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,090
of the best channels but it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> less</font>

53
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,280
valuable that<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole marketers ruin</font>

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,229
everything line that I use a lot that's

55
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">what this is all about platforms come</font>

56
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,430
along they have value<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we mark</font>

57
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,960
it against<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and then consumers kind</font>

58
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,270
of push off<font color="#CCCCCC"> its cops and robbers it's</font>

59
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,189
cat and mouse over and over and over

60
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">again and we're living in a process now</font>

61
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,210
that we're into the second decade of

62
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,750
