156
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,810
that I still<font color="#CCCCCC"> need it which is I want</font>

157
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,760
their attention what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think of the</font>

158
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,430
influencers and the desire among so many

159
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,410
people to become influencers now I'll

160
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,090
separate them what do I think about the

161
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,550
actual influencers that they're the one

162
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,740
of the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> or three best deals and</font>

163
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,930
advertising what do I think of

164
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,030
everybody's aspiration to be one makes a

165
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,740
whole lot of sense sounds like a lot of

166
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,910
fun to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> three hundred thousand</font>

167

products on Instagram but but

169
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,430
ninety-nine percent of the people

170
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,050
watching are talented enough to actually

171
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,400
create an audience what do you think

172
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,560
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about who</font>

174
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,950
try really because everybody who wants

175
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,590
to should try this is why this is why I

176
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,600
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why I question your</font>

177
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,610
thought on that because every<font color="#E5E5E5"> site</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> widow</font>

179
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">stand for yes authenticity and being</font>

00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,860
true to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are who you are there</font>

181
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,350
are so many influencers now who not all

182
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,000
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but a lot of them in order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

183
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,230
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that three hundred thousand dollars</font>

00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">a year you have to endorse tons of</font>

185
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,700
products some of which you probably

186
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,770
don't actually stand for yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

187
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,630
what will happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> over time is that</font>

188
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,550
audience will start to walk away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

190
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,600
enough value in return I think it's a

191
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,770
value exchange I also think that we're

192
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,870
educating our clients of just cuz she

193
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,240
has four million followers if when she

194
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,370
says<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy this if they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe her</font>

195
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,140
you're gonna waste money and I think as

196
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,790
the maturity of the market understands

197
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,310
that authentic executions<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna really</font>

198
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,900
matter that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you built your</font>

201
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,320

bottled water on the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> why didn't</font>

203
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,680
you do it then because i knew i was

<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna make money in a different way and</font>

207
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,420
leverage what was the lowest point<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

12th grade

210
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:00,809
why because I wasn't built to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through</font>

00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:03,389
that horse crap of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> education machine</font>

purebred entrepreneurs what were<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font>

214
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:09,869
the experiences you had teachers telling

215
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:11,219
me that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would never succeed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in life</font>

216
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:13,139
while I was making<font color="#CCCCCC"> $3,000 a weekend</font>

217
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,669
selling baseball cards and making more

money than they were making<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all my</font>

bravado and ego I got really lucky<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

220
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:21,179
parents gave me the right DNA I have a

221
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:23,189
lot of humility I didn't need to prove

222
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:24,629
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to those teachers I didn't need to</font>

223
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,520
razz them I<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't need to stick it to</font>

224
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,919
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends parents who didn't want their</font>

225
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,360
kids hanging out with me<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'd be</font>

226
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,949
a bad school influence and I wasn't

227
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:33,958
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a winner I grew up in an era</font>

228
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the 80s and 90s when education was</font>

229
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,130
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only way to win like you were going</font>

230
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,599
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be successful if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you went to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Harvard</font>

231
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,370
and then one there was no conversation

232
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,919
around entrepreneurship when I was a kid

233
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,050
entrepreneur meant you were a loser what

234
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,459
is the worst advice you've received

235
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,050
along the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost everything</font>

236
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,880
anybody's ever told me advice is bad

237
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,220
unless it's contextual and you really

238
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,130
dig deep I give very little advice to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

239
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,630
employees until I start to really get to

240
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,399
know them and so most people like to

241
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,160
give advice without context the best

242
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">advice only comes from the people</font>

243
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,550
closest to you and the ones that I've

244
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,740
actually have your best interest in mind

245
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,470
not theirs that means almost nobody

246
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,910
because that means everybody sending

247
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,889
outside and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times the people on</font>

248
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:15,959
the inside I mean mommy and daddy are

249
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,029
giving you advice in their best interest

250
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:20,569
not yours so how do you differentiate I

251
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:23,040
just don't listen to anybody and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I come</font>

252
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hurt you in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any way I do sure</font>

253
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,199
but I'll take where I'm at and I mean in

254
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:31,500
life not like in business like like it's

255
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,000
so funny how your flaws can end up

256
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,220
becoming your strengths my enormous need

257
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,430
for attention has made me give so much

258
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,079
more to my audience than I ask in return

259
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,670
because I know that will give me more

260
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,839
attention my sense of self has made me

261
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,579
obsess over how many people going to

262
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:49,560
show up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my funeral which then makes</font>

263
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,439
me want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be nice to everybody along</font>

264
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:55,139
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> because what do you want them to</font>

265
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:56,939
say about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you at your funeral what do</font>

266
00:09:56,939 --> 00:09:58,050
you want me just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know being that</font>

267
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,000
ever lived the greatest<font color="#E5E5E5"> human being that</font>

268
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,560
ever lived that didn't take my advice

269
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,569
yeah I mean I mean I don't think

270
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,550
anybody's gonna be there by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time my</font>

271
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,940
funeral nobody's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be there</font>

272
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give me advice you know because</font>

273
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,710
there's only there's nobody left like

274
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,990
it's unbelievable how visceral I am to

275
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,420
advise like nobody even attempts at any

276
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,800
more trip for people out there who are

277
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,530
feeling stuck they've been trying over

278
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,120
and over again to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they want</font>

279
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,470
that's not working<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what do they do</font>

280
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,550
something severe like get a divorce or

281
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,670
stop talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your dad or or quit your</font>

282
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,290
job I mean it I mean it well let me tell

283
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,940
you why stop talking to your dad sounds

284
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,800
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> terrible advice until you start</font>

285
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,090
realizing the thing that I've come

286
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,680
across over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last year or two which</font>

287
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,360
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> most people don't do things because</font>

288
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,920
they're scared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fail in front of</font>

289
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,720
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you start on whining</font>

290
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,460
and you realize my dad they're scared to

291
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">fail in front of somebody who's within</font>

292
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,540
their inner circle who they love the

293
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,200
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's holding them down poison is</font>

294
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,230
bad it's bad when is the last time you

00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,690
