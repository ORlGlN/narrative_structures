1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:01,293
- [Envy] Check, check, check.

2
00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:02,461
Is the mic on?
- [Ja Rule] Aye!

3
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:04,086
- Can we make it 
louder a little bit or...?

4
00:00:04,086 --> 00:00:05,797
We're good, okay.

5
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:06,632
- Yo!

6
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:07,507
Check, check.

7
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,884
- Is yours on?
- [Ja Rule] Check, check.

8
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,010
I don't really need a mic!

9
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,179
(audience laughter)

10
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,181
I got, like, a 
built in mic and shit.

11
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,015
(laughs)

12
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,850
Yo, pass me that--
- No, it's on.

13
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,684
- Yo!
- There you go.

14
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,518
- Ha hah, there we go.

15
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:22,689
Shit, ya'll can turn me 
down little bit. (chuckles)

16
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,525
- So, GaryVee.

17
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,526
Can you turn the 
mic on a little bit,

18
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,694
or do I have to do what Ja did,

19
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,820
just put the mic down?

20
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,655
(laughs)

21
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:32,531
Check, check, check, check,
check, check, check, check,

22
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:33,450
check, check, check.

23
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,327
Alright, so GaryVee is here.

24
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,454
(audience cheering)

25
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,288
- Thanks, mom.

26
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,791
- [Envy] A lot inspiration 
out there about investing

27
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,292
and things of that nature,

28
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,253
so what should people 
be looking at right now

29
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,838
as far as investments 
and making some real money?

30
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,007
What should we be looking at?

31
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,634
- Well, I think 
we need to actually,

32
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:51,593
and this is not 
going to be as hype

33
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,929
and everybody's not going to
be pumped with this answer,

34
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,931
but I'm pushing practicality.

35
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,767
You know, we got eight 
years of a good economy,

36
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,561
like this world of 
ours, and this is amb...

37
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,730
I mean, if you're here, 
you're ambitious,

38
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,565
you know what's 
going on in the new world,

39
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,359
you're hyped, 
you've got a lot of energy,

40
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,278
entrepreneurial, 
and you're a risk taker.

41
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,821
The problem is

42
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,198
when I look at this crowd,
there's so many young people

43
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,701
who've never lived 
through the punch in the mouth.

44
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,703
- [Ja Rule] Yeah, yeah.
- You know? (chuckles)

45
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,121
- [Ja Rule] I've lived through 
the punch in the mouth.

46
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,247
(laughs)
Trust me. (laughs)

47
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:24,710
- So, after eight 
great years in our economy,

48
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,878
I want people to pay attention

49
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,422
to actually making money.

50
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:32,592
You know, users, and 
engagement, and followers,

51
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,053
you know, lifetime value,
CAC, all this stuff that

52
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,306
people talk about 
in the startup world

53
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:40,142
is all nice and dandy, 
but if your business

54
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:42,227
is not making money each month

55
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,687
and it's losing money,

56
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,230
you're not going 
to be raising money

57
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,648
when there's none out there.

58
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,734
And so, I'm 
pushing practicality.

59
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,153
It's boring, 
but it's tried and true.

60
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:51,987
- [Envy] Now, 
let me ask you, Ja.

61
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,698
Now, Ja's a 
multimillion selling artist.

62
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:55,532
- [Ja Rule] Yeah.

63
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,992
- [Envy] You had your ups and 
downs, you were locked up,

64
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,035
you went to jail.
- [Ja Rule] Yep.

65
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,620
- [Envy] But you 
never lost a step.

66
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,164
You've...

67
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,165
- [Man] 'Cause he's from Queens!

68
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,751
(laughs)
(audience cheering)

69
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:06,585
- You know that!

70
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:07,836
- You've been great 
with your investments,

71
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,669
you've been great...

72
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,713
You know, we've 
never seen you lose a car,

73
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,923
we never seen any repos,

74
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,425
so explain to the 
people what you did

75
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,470
to make sure that your 
fortune was still intact.

76
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,096
- I mean, you know...

77
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,265
First thing that 
happened to me that

78
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,059
was a red flag that went off

79
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,144
and it probably 
was the best thing

80
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,229
that happened 
to me was the beef,

81
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,440
because I realized

82
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,108
that

83
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,902
my livelihood

84
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,776
was

85
00:02:33,776 --> 00:02:36,490
in a business 
that is subjective.

86
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,117
You guys don't 
have to like Ja Rule.

87
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,285
You don't have to like Drake.

88
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,496
You don't have to like Envy.

89
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,914
But tech is different.

90
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,666
You know, 
everybody uses Instagram.

91
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,001
Everybody uses Snapchat.

92
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,921
Everybody, you know, 
uses these things because

93
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,255
they're a necessity.

94
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,592
So, that was a blessing 
in disguise for me because

95
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,386
I realized that I need to,

96
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,805
you know, get 
something with little bit more

97
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:03,433
substance to carry me 
through my forties and beyond.

98
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,979
And, so, I started looking
into, getting into, you know

99
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,107
tech, tech world and

100
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,901
investing in 
different companies.

101
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:17,072
And, so far I've invested in
about four companies and

102
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,618
one just exited, so 
we just got a nice...

103
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,413
(audience cheering)

104
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,372
- That's always good.

105
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,500
- And I founded 
another one, which is Fyre,

106
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,418
which is doing really well.

107
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,877
We're profitable and--
- [Envy] Now tell the people

108
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,671
what Fyre is if they don't know.

109
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:37,509
- Fyre is basically a
booking app for all talent.

110
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,344
So, we basically 
cut out the middle man.

111
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:44,099
It's a shit show, you know,
when you trying to book talent.

112
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,059
A lot of you guys 
out here, you know,

113
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,270
that are young 
entrepreneurs, you know,

114
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,021
with nice healthy bank accounts

115
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,648
probably can 
afford some of the talent,

116
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,692
but don't know 
how to get to them and

117
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,777
would love to have a Ja Rule or

118
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,320
somebody at 
these type of events.

119
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,614
So, at your corporate, 
you know, Christmas party,

120
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,741
or bar mitzvah, you could say--

121
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,578
(laughs)
Whatever!

122
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:10,208
Me and my partner, we 
created this platform for

123
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,919
people such as yourselves, 
the private sector,

124
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,656
and also, you 
know, professional

125
00:04:17,214 --> 00:04:18,716
buyers as well,

126
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,385
to really cut 
through all the red tape

127
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,471
and get to the artists 
that they want to get to,

128
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,432
you know, real 
seamless and transparent.

129
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,601
- [Envy] So, with the app, 
what makes the app so dope is

130
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,686
let's say you wanna book...

131
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,396
Let's say you 
wanna book GaryVee.

132
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,230
- Good idea!
- [Envy] Good idea!

133
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,736
(audience laughter)
- [Ja Rule] Great idea!

134
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:35,650
- [Envy] So, instead of going 
through a booking agent

135
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,902
and going through management,

136
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,237
you put your offer 
in and it goes directly

137
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,906
to GaryVee's app.
- Yeah.

138
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,949
- GaryVee can decide 
if he wants to accept that

139
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,660
or decline, or say, "I need
more money", or, "less money",

140
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,079
or whatever it may 
be and it's direct.

141
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,873
You don't have to 
worry about the agents.

142
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,374
You don't have to 
worry about bookings fees.

143
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,544
It's direct to the 
consumer, which is dope.

144
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,796
- [Ja Rule] Which 
is really dope.

145
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,381
- Now GaryVee, you 
get a lot of shit sometimes

146
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,800
for telling people about
themselves and telling people

147
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,594
to get off their ass.

148
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:03,428
(audience laughter)

149
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,515
All the time, so tell people
about why you are so hard

150
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,350
on people about getting off
their ass and getting into

151
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,145
investing, doing 
some of the things you do.

152
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:16,650
- Truth is, I'm only saying
that to people that complain.

153
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,736
Like the problem is, most
people are complaining, right?

154
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,907
Like my advice is very basic,
I just don't understand why

155
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,439
you would complain 
versus doing something about it.

156
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,287
Everybody's got something.

157
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:33,572
Everybody's got 
some issue, minorities,

158
00:05:33,572 --> 00:05:36,992
the family you grew up with,
the neighborhood you came from,

159
00:05:36,992 --> 00:05:40,048
got screwed by this person,
all the kids that were told

160
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,717
to go to college and amassed
a tremendous amount of debt

161
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:46,054
to get a good job, 
fucked, all of them.

162
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,598
You know, so I think that,--

163
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,308
- Very true (laughing)

164
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,268
- For me,

165
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,520
there's a lot of people 
that have personal brands

166
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,064
that put out content 
that are tricking people

167
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,025
and they don't want them to
succeed and they wanna just

168
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,571
get money from them 
to make money themselves,

169
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,478
make a couple 
thousand bucks on their course.

170
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:07,450
I want the people that watch
me to eventually never watch me

171
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,280
again, my big thesis is to
have less followers not more

172
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,790
because I want to give 
the tools and the blueprint

173
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,336
for them to go do instead of
reading another fucking book

174
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,089
or going to another 
fucking conference.

175
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,676
Like eventually all that shit
is just disguised excuses

176
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,344
'cause you don't wanna 
put in the actual work

177
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,804
that it takes to win.

178
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,055
(audience cheering)

179
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,683
- [Ja Rule] Right, I agree.
- Truth, 100%.

180
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,102
- [Envy] You know, one thing 
about GaryVee, you know when

181
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,335
I first met GaryVee I really 
wasn't fond of him,

182
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:38,441
I really didn't like him.
(audience laughter)

183
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:40,609
And I'm gonna tell you 
why, because you hear this

184
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,320
all the time from 
inspiration speakers--

185
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,696
- Yeah
- [Envy] and they tell you what

186
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,323
you should do and it 
seems like it's a rip-off.

187
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,033
You should be working harder!

188
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,659
You should do this!

189
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,037
And I tested GaryVee 
liive on air and I said well,

190
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,914
since you know so much Mr. Vee,--

191
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,749
(audience laughter)

192
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,583
- He did.

193
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,126
- Tell the people who 
listen right now what they

194
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,296
need to do, and he broke 
it down, what people can do

195
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,631
to make money 'cus 
that's a lot of people's thing,

196
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,966
they say well I have money but
I don't know what to invest,

197
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,593
I don't know how to 
read the stock market,

198
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,387
I don't know what I can invest
in that will make me money.

199
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,640
I don't want to lose my 
saving and you came up with

200
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,059
some great ideas which made
me love GaryVee, like he's

201
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,436
really about helping people.

202
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,689
- My big thing that I got lucky
with is I know how to make

203
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,567
money outside, like the 
money I've made in my life

204
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,902
has been about 
building business.

205
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,196
I built a liquor store, like
I built an agency that goes

206
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,822
after Fortune 50 companies.

207
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,616
I'm not trying to get their
money like a lot of people

208
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,544
that look that part, so 
for me it's the other way,

209
00:07:32,544 --> 00:07:35,080
I'm trying to disproportionally
help because that's legacy.

210
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,790
I'm gonna get my 
currency elsewhere.

211
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,751
This is about legacy, this
is about people emailing you

212
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,711
and saying fuck, 
you helped my life.

213
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,130
That shit, listen, when I get
an email from my team of like

214
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,508
we won an RFP, 
I don't give a fuck.

215
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,760
You get an email from somebody
who's like I was on welfare

216
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,887
and now I'm not because I
watched fucking Breakfast Club.

217
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,223
I'm like fuck, 
that's some crazy shit.

218
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,891
(audience laughter)

219
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,017
That feels better.

220
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,812
I've always been able to
make money, that's my talent.

221
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,565
You can make art, people have
skills, I'm good at that.

222
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,859
This now with the 
communication paths we have,

223
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,861
it's why I love doing your
show, a lot of fucking people

224
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,655
listen to your show.
- [Ja Rule] Yeah.

225
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,700
- I can go on there and 
use that distribution to help

226
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,410
somebody and then 
that builds legacy,

227
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,036
that's how you build brand.

228
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,914
I'm in for marathon 
money not sprint money.

229
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,748
(audience cheering)

230
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,916
- [Envy] There you go.
- [Ja Rule] absolutely.

231
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,167
Wealth.

232
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,836
- [Envy] Now what 
about you, Ja,

233
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,004
as far as investing, what
do you look for in a company

234
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,423
when you're looking 
to invest and put money

235
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,341
towards something?

236
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,592
- [Ja Rule] It depends.

237
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,261
You know I'm a passionate guy.

238
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,263
I go with things 
that I'm passionate about

239
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,975
that I can actually 
go out there and promote

240
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,268
with my heart.

241
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,227
If I can't do that then 
I'm not gonna fuck with it

242
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:44,184
because it's not real to me, so,

243
00:08:44,184 --> 00:08:47,444
I look for things that 
I'm interested in that I think

244
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:51,349
are great companies 
that have a future, not just

245
00:08:51,349 --> 00:08:55,368
a quick exit strategy, 
but actually some companies

246
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,581
have a real real plan of how
they want to change the world

247
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,709
and move things forward and
move our culture forward so

248
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,836
I love those type of companies.

249
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,206
- [Envy] Now what 
about you GaryVee?

250
00:09:07,206 --> 00:09:09,048
You know another reason 
I didn't really like you

251
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,342
is 'cause you a Jets 
fan and I'm a Giants fan.

252
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,635
(audience cheering)

253
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,053
- Keenan!

254
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,055
- You said one 
of your main goals

255
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,183
is to actually buy the Jets.

256
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:21,478
I don't know why you'd wanna
do that, maybe the Giants.

257
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:22,520
- Gary I want in on that

258
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,716
- You got it Ja, I wanna
do it ''cause we need

259
00:09:24,716 --> 00:09:26,065
a fucking Super Bowl.

260
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,442
(laughing)

261
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,694
- [Envy] So now when you're 
lookin' to acquire in somethin'

262
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,446
and invest, what do you look at?

263
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,698
- In this world, 
in the South-by world,

264
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,468
I look for the 
jockey over the horse,

265
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:39,370
so I'm looking at 
does she have the fire

266
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,165
to change her business 
nine months in when

267
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,167
the market changed on her?
- [Ja Rule] Mhmmm.

268
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,629
So in startup land, it's hard.
- [Ja Rule] Yeah.

269
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,032
Like, when you're 
building something from zero,

270
00:09:49,032 --> 00:09:51,174
like in public, like let 
me tell you guys like all

271
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,024
to make money.

272
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,351
No joke, if 
you're sitting on money,

273
00:09:53,351 --> 00:09:55,585
every person here 
should invest in Facebook,

274
00:09:55,585 --> 00:09:57,806
and then when the 
world melts in nine months

275
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,557
and the stocks in 
half and you hate me,

276
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,476
don't sell it, just hold on,

277
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,921
because I promise 
you in nine years,

278
00:10:02,921 --> 00:10:06,064
that investment's gonna return
you a fuck load of money.

279
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:09,108
That's the slow, double 
or triple your money bet,

280
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,944
but that's kind of better
than the fucking zero interest

281
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,612
you get in the bank.

282
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,241
The way to make 
crazy money is to only bet

283
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,250
on the jockey,

284
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,964
because they've got to pivot,

285
00:10:18,964 --> 00:10:20,662
they've got to adjust.

286
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,289
You know, 
the operator, the pilot,

287
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,911
she and he is the one 
that's gonna dominate and win

288
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:28,555
because the reality is,

289
00:10:28,555 --> 00:10:30,752
these startups are 
so young and early.

290
00:10:30,752 --> 00:10:33,277
Facebook looks nothing 
like what Facebook looked like

291
00:10:33,277 --> 00:10:34,415
nine years ago.

292
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:36,672
He made a bunch of adjustments.

293
00:10:36,672 --> 00:10:38,107
Like this shit changes,

294
00:10:38,107 --> 00:10:39,745
and you've got 
to be used to that.

295
00:10:39,745 --> 00:10:41,766
Spotify had to adjust.

296
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,301
Birchbox has to adjust.

297
00:10:43,301 --> 00:10:46,759
Like everybody's navigating 
and just raising capital

298
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,037
or looking the part,

299
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:49,634
so I'm looking for 
somebody who can get

300
00:10:49,634 --> 00:10:50,942
punched in the mouth,

301
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:54,404
spit the blood out 
and move forward.

302
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,864
- [Man 2] Yeah.
- [Woman] I'm right here.

303
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:56,990
- [Envy] She thinks 
she's it right there.

304
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,366
- You got it.
- [Ja Rule] I like that.

305
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,367
- I like that.

306
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,785
- [Envy] Is there anything else 
that you wanna tell the people

307
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,586
since we have 'em here and
they're sitting here listening?

308
00:11:02,586 --> 00:11:03,802
- Ja?

309
00:11:03,802 --> 00:11:05,594
- No, I just wanna, you know,

310
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:08,251
get on that what you just said.

311
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,201
The adjust.

312
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,690
You know, my company Fyre is,

313
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,192
we're eight months in

314
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:16,050
and we've probably 
adjusted twice already,

315
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,427
you know?
(laughs)

316
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,715
Because, when you 
start a company you realize

317
00:11:20,715 --> 00:11:23,391
these things sometimes have
legs of their own and they

318
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,352
take on different 
turns that you didn't expect,

319
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:31,107
and you gotta go ahead and
attack those situations, so

320
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,988
I'm 100 percent in agreement 
with adjustment, man.

321
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:35,626
- Can we do maybe like 
two or three questions?

322
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:37,113
- [Envy] Yeah, absolutely. 
Anybody got questions?

323
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,281
- [Lisa] Yeah.

324
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,782
- Go ahead.
- [Envy] You gotta yell loud.

325
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,034
- [Lisa] Hi!
- Hi.

326
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,744
- [Lisa] So what 
would be your advice for

327
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,344
someone who's trying 
to scale their company?

328
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:46,748
I have an alcohol infused
cupcake company in Las Vegas.

329
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,667
- An alcohol 
infused cupcake company.

330
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,501
- [Envy] Cool.
(audience laughter)

331
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,586
- [Lisa] Called Sin City Cupcakes.

332
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,633
- Okay.
- Yeah, I like that too.

333
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:55,840
(audience laughter)

334
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,758
- Go ahead.

335
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:57,589
- [Lisa] Year five.
- Year five

336
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:00,125
- [Lisa] Year five, and my goal,

337
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,847
I have a partner, she and 
I met in the modeling industry

338
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:02,847
like ten years ago.
- Okay.

339
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,223
- [Lisa] My goal's 
to build and sell.

340
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,525
- Okay.
- [Lisa] So we've had some

341
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:08,113
players talk to us, but we 
made a couple million.

342
00:12:08,113 --> 00:12:10,438
Everything's good but I wanna
take it to like ten million.

343
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,689
- Okay.
- [Lisa] We're based in Vegas,

344
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,608
which is a great place, if
you're coming to overspend,

345
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,747
overindulge, buy things you're
not gonna buy at home, right?

346
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:18,112
You will spend $52 for 
a dozen alcohol cupcakes.

347
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,323
- Yep.
- [Lisa] But to take that to

348
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,950
a ten million dollar company,
I feel like we have to go

349
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,368
outside of Las Vegas,--
- Okay.

350
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,661
- [Lisa] and I don't know if 
we've pigeon holed ourselves,

351
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,162
as Sin City Cupcakes.

352
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,290
- So, a brand can 
change all the time, right?

353
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,292
Like, just 'cause 
you're called Sin City,

354
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,324
doesn't mean it 
won't work somewhere else.

355
00:12:33,324 --> 00:12:34,446
You just have to execute.

356
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:35,491
The bigger question is,

357
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:38,263
how does your model change when

358
00:12:38,263 --> 00:12:40,610
people are not 
buying $52 cupcakes

359
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,767
because they're not drunk as
fuck and it's that one weekend

360
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:44,389
they have to escape.
- [Lisa] Right.

361
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,765
- Right? So, when 
they're in Dallas...

362
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,133
Now, what I would do is,

363
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,937
I would level it up 
mentally into escapism.

364
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,711
What Vegas 
really is is escapism.

365
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:53,771
It's a break

366
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:55,441
from your reality.
- [Lisa] Right.

367
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,527
- So if you're gonna 
go to New York or L.A.,

368
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,153
or Dallas or Miami,

369
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,285
there's pockets, even though
the whole city isn't that,

370
00:13:02,285 --> 00:13:04,659
there's pockets of escapism,

371
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,661
and so you should 
reverse engineer the psychology

372
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,955
of the people that 
actually buy your product

373
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,033
and then level that up,

374
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:11,457
and that's how 
I would think about

375
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,565
second and third locations.

376
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:15,503
What replicates the 
mentality of the decision maker

377
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,171
in those places.

378
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,006
Mhmmm.

379
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,717
- [Envy] Now one thing GaryVee
told me on the Breakfast Club

380
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,680
that stuck with me,

381
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,345
is of course with the 
Breakfast Club you have

382
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,055
a lot of following 
on social media

383
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,140
and we sell a lot 
of different things,

384
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,183
like there's merchandise, 
we own a juice bar,

385
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,049
a carwash, different things,

386
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:33,767
but he said you have to 
use your social media right.

387
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:35,606
In the bio of my social media,

388
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,900
I was sending it to 
all different places,

389
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,242
but what he said on 
the Breakfast Club was,

390
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:41,713
in your bio, 
when people click it,

391
00:13:41,713 --> 00:13:44,782
make it to where there 
can go and purchase something,

392
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,136
not just randomly 
clicking to your podcast,

393
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:48,682
not randomly clicking,

394
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:51,224
and we've seen sales 
of the juice bar shoot up,

395
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:53,066
by just changing 
that little thing.

396
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,535
And I wanted to say 
thank you for that.

397
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:56,586
- I think the one 
thing I can tell all of you

398
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:57,922
and again, looking at the demo,

399
00:13:57,922 --> 00:14:02,216
you have to be the architect 
and the plumber, right?

400
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,552
And the mason, and 
the garbageperson.

401
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,728
Like the thing that 
I have a lot of pride in,

402
00:14:06,728 --> 00:14:09,177
is I can come on 
and talk all high level

403
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:11,350
and then when somebody calls
me to the mat like you did,

404
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,144
the reason I love you is,

405
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,304
I do a lot of shit,

406
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:16,536
and I just pontificate, 
and nobody calls me

407
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:17,999
to the mat,--
- [Envy] Yeah, yeah.

408
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:19,111
- we run out of time and I leave.

409
00:14:19,111 --> 00:14:20,743
You called me to the 
mat, I'm like, "Okay."

410
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:23,440
But what I'm excited 
about is that's my best moment,

411
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,070
because if you 
wanna go into details,

412
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,117
I'll get so 
finite into that detail,

413
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,704
so to me, the one 
thing I would pride myself in

414
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,403
as you grow in your business...

415
00:14:33,403 --> 00:14:35,148
How many people here 
have a business that has more

416
00:14:35,148 --> 00:14:37,026
than five employees?

417
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:38,932
Great, ten?

418
00:14:38,932 --> 00:14:40,236
Twenty?

419
00:14:40,236 --> 00:14:42,175
Great, so like I said, 
look around, this is great.

420
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,296
There's enough 
to talk about this.

421
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:46,072
As you grow, the thing 
that I have the most pride in,

422
00:14:46,072 --> 00:14:48,615
is VaynerMedia 
now has 800 employees.

423
00:14:48,615 --> 00:14:50,395
Not one of them 
that works for me

424
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:53,851
does as much actual 
social media as I do.

425
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,587
I'm still, by far,

426
00:14:55,587 --> 00:14:58,689
and that's probably 
the biggest reason,

427
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,765
my side hustle is GaryVee,

428
00:15:00,765 --> 00:15:04,237
is because it keeps me 
grounded in actually the doing

429
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,592
of the shit that I'm doing,

430
00:15:05,592 --> 00:15:07,400
and what happens to a 
lot of people as they grow,

431
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,109
they get away from the work 
and they become a manager

432
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,494
and then they 
don't know what the fuck

433
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:14,580
they're talking about. 
(audience laughter)

434
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,082
- [Ja Rule] I'm terrible 
at social media,

435
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,967
(laughing)

436
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:21,462
- But real quick Ja,

437
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,172
if that's not 
your actual business--

438
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,006
- [Ja Rule] That's 
not my business.

439
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:24,841
- Then that's 
a different thing.

440
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:25,675
If that's part of your business,

441
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,135
but if it's your 
actual fuckin' business,

442
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,636
the amount of people 
that roll up on me like,

443
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,847
"Gary I got a social 
media agency this Sunday."

444
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,723
I ask them four social 
media tactical questions,

445
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,350
and they have no fuckin' idea.

446
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,184
I'm like you ain't shit.

447
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,352
You're full of shit, dick.

448
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,604
(audience laughter)

449
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,065
Sorry, I'm getting fired.

450
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,943
(laughing)

451
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,903
- This is how people 
fuckin' get fired up,

452
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,822
and they go home 
and do great shit.

453
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,115
- That's what I think!

454
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,867
- Any other questions 
for GaryVee or Ja?

455
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:51,826
- [Woman] Yeah, 
I have a question.

456
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:52,660
- Go ahead, over here.

457
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,036
Oh! There you are.

458
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,330
- [Woman] So, I know,
Ireland to here.

459
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,206
- I know, I love it.

460
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,480
- [Woman] We're only as 
strong as our team right?

461
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,168
And I really 
appreciate my interns,

462
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,170
so what can I do to create

463
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,380
the most amazing 
internship experience

464
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,717
so they optimize 
growing as a professional?

465
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,136
- Ja, your 
perspective on internship.

466
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,262
- Man, you know,

467
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,431
I would like to see,

468
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,100
interns are easy to me,

469
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,104
because your interns should
want to grow with the company

470
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,689
and wanna run through walls

471
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,609
and do everything 
possible to help you win

472
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,820
and to take their 
career to the next level.

473
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,615
So for me, interns are easy.

474
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:35,369
It's more, I look at the 
employees at my workplace

475
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:39,248
where I feel as though 
I take on a kind of a new way

476
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,543
of nurturing my 
employees, you know,

477
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:46,505
kinda giving them that 
five o'clock break to go to

478
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,342
fuckin' yoga or whatever 
the fuck they want to do,

479
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,052
the gym or whatever.

480
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,054
Give them a longer lunch.

481
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,472
You know let them go out

482
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,265
you don't gotta eat 
lunch in the office.

483
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,601
Go have a good 
time, come on back.

484
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,479
Because it keeps them focused,

485
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,773
it keeps them wanting 
to work for the company,

486
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,900
it keeps them 
wanting to be great.

487
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,694
And I think that 
those things help, you know,

488
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,863
nurture and grow your business.

489
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,448
- I have a pretty similar answer

490
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,824
with one little twist.

491
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:17,161
To me, whether it's 
interns or employees,

492
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,997
you have to reverse 
engineer them one by one.

493
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,458
So Ja's talking about a 
lot of people who do wanna

494
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,211
take a break, 
can't keep concentration

495
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,088
and hustle for 14 hours a day.

496
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,966
Meanwhile, somebody 
else as an intern wants

497
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,134
to work 19 hours a day everyday,

498
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,552
'cause they want 
you to pay more money.

499
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,888
I'm pumped that I 
know that Ben Benrubi

500
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,473
who's sitting 
right there came to me.

501
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,226
You have to be open to 
him and making him feel safe

502
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,727
that when he came into 
my office six months ago

503
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,437
and said, "Yo bro, I 
don't want to be known

504
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,398
"just as a Snapchat guy."

505
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,816
I'm like cool Ben I get that.

506
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,901
Or Emily and the 
four different functions

507
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,278
she's done at VeynerCayner

508
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,946
Or Steph Bagley 
who worked at Vayner,

509
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,572
but I always knew 
had other ambitions,

510
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,616
and I helped her 
get that next job right?

511
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,784
Or Kim Garcia,

512
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,203
who's so fucking 
ambitious and monster,

513
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,163
I'm always sweating when 
I have a meeting with her

514
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,456
because I know I have to step up

515
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,333
and give her more challenges.

516
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,794
And our last conversation was,

517
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,131
do I have something 
for you which I created,

518
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,133
or was thing going to 
be the end of our thing?

519
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,676
Those are four or 
five different people,

520
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,177
who have four or 
five different things,

521
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:18,055
and I'm trying to 
scale that with 800 people.

522
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,140
I wanna know, do 
you want to make...

523
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,057
I love when people are like,

524
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,143
"Millennials like 
work-life balance."

525
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:25,104
Millennials want 
fuckin' cash too.

526
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,311
(audience laughter)
- Absolutely.

527
00:18:26,311 --> 00:18:29,775
- And so if you're a 
millennial that wants cash,

528
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,235
then you gotta 
like, when people,

529
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,069
I love when people are like,

530
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,030
"Gary, I wanna be 
the CEO of this company."

531
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,616
When I meet with 
them, I'm like, Mazel Tov.

532
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,994
I'm like, you need 
to work 20 hours a day

533
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,538
every day for the next 13 years.

534
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,665
And then they're like, alright
let me think about that.

535
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,791
(audience laughter)

536
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,253
So I don't want to, for 
an intern, it's super simple.

537
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,212
You go right up to her and say,

538
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,257
"Katherine, what the 
fuck do you want out of this?"

539
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,134
She may say, 
"I want a job here."

540
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,469
You'll tell her 
how to work on things.

541
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,554
She may say, "I know 
that you know GaryVee

542
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,638
"and I wanna work 
at VaynerMedia."

543
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,140
Then you should email me.

544
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,267
You can't make 
the call for them.

545
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,769
You need to 
figure out what it is,

546
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,645
and then put them in 
that position to succeed

547
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,467
one by one by one.

548
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:10,483
-[Ja Rule] Yep.
(audience applause)

549
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,609
- [Envy] Alright.
- [Ja Rule] absolutely.

550
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,986
- [Envy] Any other questions?

551
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,488
Go ahead.

552
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,491
- [Man] So you know, 
as entrepreneurs,

553
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,494
as we grow and everything, 
I'm wondering Gary,

554
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,537
how do you stay in 
touch with your employees?

555
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,165
Okay, because everybody 
like us goes through highs,

556
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,376
goes through lows, it's 
never as good as it seems,

557
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,585
it's never as bad as it seems.

558
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:33,214
How do you, you know, 
authenticate to them

559
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,882
the challenges 
they're going through

560
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,509
and, you know, 
have that communication.

561
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,635
- I don't.

562
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:41,263
I do not have any 
interest in my employees

563
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,432
worrying about my headaches.

564
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,433
I'm the CEO.

565
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,062
I mean that, I don't need...

566
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:48,896
- [Man] They're headaches.

567
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,564
- Their headaches 
are what I just told you

568
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,108
which is my door is open.

569
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,527
Most of them 
don't take me up on it,

570
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,862
so then I watch 
them and I listen.

571
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,531
I've got 100 people 
internally that give me

572
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,324
optics to the other 700.

573
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,618
I follow all 800 
of them on social

574
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,786
and try to pay attention.

575
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,913
I created an HR 
division that is much more

576
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,665
on the offense and 
not about the paperwork,

577
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:11,001
hiring and firing, and 
I just try the best I can.

578
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,420
I mean you just 
do the best you can.

579
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,422
It's no different than 
parenting, running a business,

580
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,756
putting out, you just do like,

581
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,675
everybody's 
beating themselves up.

582
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,428
If you just do the 
best you can, that's...

583
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,971
It's the intent my man.

584
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,764
The intent is what matters.

585
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,141
For the most part, 
eventually they know

586
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,892
that's actually 
what I give a fuck about,

587
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,769
and then that's 
what wins it over.

588
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,896
It's not the tactics, 
it's the religion.

589
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,731
- [Ja Rule] For me, I just 
wanna answer that too

590
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,652
because I have a 
different thing going on,

591
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,237
because I'm, you know, Ja Rule.

592
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,322
(audience laughter)

593
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,452
No, but it's for real.

594
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:47,499
But I say that to say

595
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:50,499
a lot of my employees

596
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,252
were kids that listened 
and grew up to my music.

597
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,044
- Yeah.

598
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,796
- And so they're somewhat fans.

599
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,174
So I'm not always in the office

600
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,676
you know because I travel and
I gotta move around still.

601
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:04,013
But I make it my 
business to go into the office

602
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,890
and see what 
they're doing, say hi,

603
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,726
because I know at some 
point they probably think

604
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,768
I don't give a fuck.
You know what I'm saying?

605
00:21:10,768 --> 00:21:13,063
They're like Ja's 
busy and Ja's doing Ja,

606
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,857
but I make it my 
business to come in there

607
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,901
and let em' know I'm 
interested in what you're doing,

608
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,736
I got my eye on 
what you're doing,

609
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,738
and I wanna be a 
part of, you know,

610
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,032
what you guys are 
doing every day all day.

611
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,325
So if you have, 
and a second thing,

612
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,159
if you have any questions,

613
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,494
come in my office, 
my door's open.

614
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,787
And I'll come and stop 
down in their stations too

615
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,831
just to check one em' 
and make em' feel wanted

616
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,999
and part of the company.

617
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,876
- The other thing, 
do you have a company?

618
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:34,710
- [Man] Yep!

619
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,544
- And how many 
employees do you have?

620
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,882
- [Man] About 40.
- Great.

621
00:21:36,882 --> 00:21:39,006
The biggest key, this is subtle,

622
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:42,301
you can't let your five 
to six more senior people

623
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,303
think they have any 
more equity with you

624
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,513
than your bottom five or six.

625
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,185
- [Ja Rule] True.
- It's such a big one.

626
00:21:47,185 --> 00:21:48,307
- [Ja Rule] Yeah.

627
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,350
- One of the best 
things going for Vayner,

628
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,644
most people don't 
know it, a good amount do,

629
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,395
and the one's that do love it.

630
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:57,733
I won't take an SVP's 
word over a community manager.

631
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,318
It's just two human beings.

632
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,071
And a lot of times, the 
truth is the bigger you get,

633
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,195
they more politics you 
play to keep the people

634
00:22:04,195 --> 00:22:05,991
underneath you, cause 
you're just trying to hold on

635
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,202
to your $200,000 job.

636
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:11,372
So the biggest thing 
that I would tell you at 40,

637
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,375
is make sure those five 
are on even playing field

638
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,086
with the bottom five, and 
everybody fuckin' knows it.

639
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,607
- [Ja Rule] Yep.

640
00:22:18,607 --> 00:22:21,743
- [Envy] Other questions?

641
00:22:21,743 --> 00:22:24,218
- [Man 2] What are your thoughts
on Puerto Rico becoming

642
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,971
the next Silicon Valley 
from the tax exemption?

643
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,098
- Puerto Rico because 
of the tax exemption?

644
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,391
- [Man 2] Yeah, the tax exemption.

645
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:31,674
- You think it's gonna 
be the next Silicon Valley?

646
00:22:31,674 --> 00:22:33,519
- [Man 2] There's a lot 
of companies moving there.

647
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,854
- I'm aware.
- [Man 2] Like 4%.

648
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,939
- You think it's gonna 
be the next Silicon Valley?

649
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,712
- [Man 2] A lot of companies--
- That's not what I asked you.

650
00:22:38,712 --> 00:22:40,925
(audience laughter)

651
00:22:42,184 --> 00:22:44,196
You think 4% tax 
is gonna bring all

652
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,699
the best tech talent in 
the world to Puerto Rico?

653
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,158
- [Man 2] Not only that but--

654
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,703
- But that's what makes
Silicon Valley Silicon Valley.

655
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,789
Silicon Valley's advantage 
is that when you graduate,

656
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,584
whether you're in Boston 
or Puerto Rico or Sweden,

657
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:59,295
you want to move 
to Silicon Valley.

658
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,964
They have the brand game won.

659
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,174
And they have the 
engineers and the tech talent.

660
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,968
There's a lot of 
business talent here.

661
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:09,305
As I look around, not a lot
of hardcore backend developers

662
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,223
chilling with us tonight, right?

663
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,266
(audience laughter)

664
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,601
To build the 
biggest companies...

665
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,853
Respect my man. Respect.

666
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,187
My man, raise your hand again.

667
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,439
Give it up for that man!

668
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,107
Let's go baby, yeah!

669
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,194
So the thing, my man, that a
lot of people misunderstand,

670
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,238
is the engineering 
talent to build

671
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,073
the biggest 
companies in the world.

672
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,325
That's where they all go.

673
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,660
And until that changes, 
that's the hard thing

674
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,204
for New York or L.A. 
or other places to crack.

675
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,623
The biggest 
thing Puerto Rico needs

676
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,249
is what's happening in L.A.

677
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,251
When you start creating 
millionaires and billionaires

678
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,253
off a big exit like Snapchat,

679
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,839
and then that creates 
the whole ecosystem.

680
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,592
Puerto Rico, much like 
Boston, New York, Austin,

681
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:51,246
needs that monstrous 
10, 20, 40, $80 billion exit

682
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:53,682
and it then spits out 
all those billionaires

683
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,863
that stay in Puerto Rico 
and build up the ecosystem.

684
00:23:55,863 --> 00:23:59,438
That's the key to 
unlock the next Silicon Valley.

685
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,481
- Alright.

686
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,107
- [Envy] Another question? 
Right here?

687
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,318
- [Scott] Gary, over the 
years I've interviewed you

688
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,111
five or six times 
for different things.

689
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:06,987
- Yes, yes.

690
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,323
- [Scott] You've 
obviously now started looking

691
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:12,076
at strategic ways to 
develop not just an agency

692
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,328
but a sports division.
- Yes.

693
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:15,954
- [Scott] All these 
different companies.

694
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,623
When you look at 
the VC world, right now?

695
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:18,457
- The VC world.

696
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,501
- [Man 3] Do you see a 
mass consolidation happening

697
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,128
with that industry as 
people see your model,

698
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,674
which is not necessarily
investment by dollars per-se

699
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,342
but investment by services,

700
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:31,136
where is the 
relevancy of VCs long term?

701
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,554
- I think VC is gonna go through

702
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,139
a really difficult time soon.

703
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,182
I really do.

704
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,850
It's a bubble and a half--
- Yes sir.

705
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,561
- Over-evaluations, so VC is
gonna do what it's always done

706
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,689
in three or four 
cycles, you know.

707
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:45,150
VC, as you know, and we have
been jammin' for a long time.

708
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,778
2005-6, this whole new
Web 2.0 thing comes

709
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,947
and then everybody's a VC.

710
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:52,616
Right everybody's an 
investor, and an angel investor,

711
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,576
and everybody's got a startup.

712
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,579
The second we have a 
macroeconomic slow down,

713
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,574
which we will, we haven't 
had one since 2008.

714
00:25:00,574 --> 00:25:03,627
I think VC is gonna 
consolidate dramatically.

715
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,421
LPs are gonna 
pour less money in.

716
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:06,964
And we'll have a complete reset.

717
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,383
All the B and C and D players
in here will get exposed

718
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,218
and go work at fucking TD bank.

719
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,970
(audience laughter)

720
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,432
And then the real 
entrepreneurs will take more.

721
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,809
Like, the amount 
of wealth creation--

722
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,018
- [Scott] Like what 
happened in '08.

723
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,031
- Exactly, the 
amount of wealth creation

724
00:25:21,031 --> 00:25:22,920
that I'm gonna 
have in the next chapter

725
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,149
is going to be extraordinary
because I'm going to buy up

726
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,734
a lot of people's in 
this room's businesses

727
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,902
for a penny on the dollar.

728
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,321
- [Scott] So my question then
is, do you think more companies

729
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,699
are going to start 
seeing that and being more like

730
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,325
what you're doing 
through your Vayner enterprise?

731
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,369
- What you're saying 
is very smart, my friend.

732
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,282
Yes I think smart 
money will always win.

733
00:25:40,282 --> 00:25:41,874
If you take my 
million dollar check,

734
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,334
you have a marketing 
machine behind you.

735
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,252
You have me.

736
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,421
And the reason we're 
going to sports agency world is,

737
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:51,049
Roc Nation's great but,
you know, Jay-Z is busy.

738
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,635
Right, like 
he's not helping you.

739
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,304
He's leveraging his name.

740
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:59,475
And I'm nowhere close to that,
but I will use my assets.

741
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:02,144
The guys I have are about 
to make so much more money

742
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,353
off the field than the people

743
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,355
that get drafted 
three rounds ahead of them.

744
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,274
I have a funny feeling that's
going to work in my favor

745
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,567
in the next draft class.

746
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,860
(audience member whistles)

747
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,570
- You wanna be?
- [Woman 2] Choose me.

748
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,447
(audience laughter)
- You're chosen. Done.

749
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,698
- [Woman 2] I got you.
- I'm in.

750
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,116
(audience laughter)
- Bet.

751
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,451
- [Woman 2] All the way.
- Done.

752
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:18,660
(audience clapping)

753
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,513
- Alright, and this 
is the last question.

754
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:20,871
Last question anybody?

755
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:21,914
- [Man 4] Right here, I got one.

756
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:22,748
- Go ahead.

757
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:23,582
- [Man 4] I'm down 
here, I'm right here.

758
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,416
- Alright.

759
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,418
- [Man 4] So, Gary and Ja I want

760
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,753
both your perspectives on this.

761
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,255
You said a lot about 
betting on the jockey,

762
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,424
not on the horse.
- Yeah.

763
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,426
- [Man 4] So what 
happens when the jockeys

764
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,428
are really 
really good salespeople,

765
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,014
but they haven't figured out
how to scale the business yet.

766
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,182
Do you still bet on them?

767
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,350
Or do you want 
them to figure out both

768
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,518
before they get to you.

769
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:43,519
- Ja?

770
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,895
- As a VC?

771
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,648
- [Man 4] Angel investor, 
you know somebody

772
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:50,067
who's going to help monetarily
as well as other resources.

773
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,903
- You know, it's so 
much due diligence that goes

774
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,072
into that type 
of stuff, you know.

775
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:58,283
I don't like to 
invest in something

776
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,494
that I don't think is a home run

777
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:03,455
or I don't think they have
their shit all the way together.

778
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,790
You know what I mean?

779
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,293
And I won't do it just because
it's a passion thing for me.

780
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,503
I gotta believe in it.

781
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:12,163
I gotta want to carry 
this thing on my back too.

782
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:16,677
So certain situations like
that I may slide away from.

783
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,762
- The way I think I heard 
you ask the question

784
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,849
is you feel like you're 
really great or your team

785
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,309
are really great 
salespeople but you haven't had

786
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,478
the ability before 
to scale a business

787
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,355
so you don't know 
how to do that yet?

788
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,398
- [Man 4] Not yet.
- Yeah.

789
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,232
- [Man 4] Not yet.

790
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,525
- So I'm gonna say something
that I think you'll like.

791
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:32,776
Which is great.

792
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,821
I'm a big fan of 
betting on salespeople.

793
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,407
Sales DNA is a very good idea.

794
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:41,785
Making money has a funny way
of fixing a lot of problems.

795
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,036
- [Man 4] Ah, shit! 
(audience laughter)

796
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:46,540
- So if you ask me, 
I love sales driven CEOs,

797
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,918
but I have to see what 
your business is about, right?

798
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,795
If you're a great salesperson,

799
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:55,674
but your product is jack shit
it's not going to matter.

800
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,510
So there's a lot of 
factors that go into it.

801
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,889
But if I had my way, the 
person is the slight thing

802
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,098
that I would bet on.

803
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,892
But I have to 
believe in their thesis.

804
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,059
If you're like, 
hey, we're selling

805
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,145
this detox fucking 
mushroom soup--

806
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:09,813
- [Man 4] Or selling snake oil--
- I'm like fuck that.

807
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,064
- [Man 4] You have to be pretty
good at selling snake oil.

808
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,441
- Exactly, yeah exactly.
- [Man 4] Got it.

809
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:13,317
- Cool.
- [Man 4] Appreciate it.

810
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:14,234
- Thank you guys.

811
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,986
- Now we're closing you 
got something in closing?

812
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,112
- [Envy] Closing? Ja?

813
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,281
- It's 2017 let's go out 
and get some fucking money.

814
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,533
(audience laughter)

815
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,076
- [Envy] GaryVee? GaryVee?

816
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,037
- God, fuck that was perfect.

817
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:29,583
You know, I would say, let's
go make some actual money

818
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,627
because shit's 
about to hit the fan

819
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:35,047
and making money is 
a very good strategy.

820
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:37,549
- [Envy] Alright.

821
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,343
- It's a funny thing to say
but this, like, South-by,

822
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,811
is loaded with people 
that are building apps

823
00:28:41,811 --> 00:28:45,057
and building thesises but
don't know how to make money.

824
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,184
- [Envy] Give it up 
for GaryVee, Ja Rule.

825
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,478
(audience cheering)

826
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,438
- [Gary] Great job, 
you did a great job.

827
00:28:51,438 --> 00:00:00,000
(bright music)
