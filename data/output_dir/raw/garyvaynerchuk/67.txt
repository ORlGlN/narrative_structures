1
00:00:00,113 --> 00:00:02,425
- Six months ago when
we first realized it,

2
00:00:02,425 --> 00:00:06,452
if I touched what I'm touching right now,

3
00:00:06,452 --> 00:00:10,666
the way I'm touching right
now, it was massive pain.

4
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:11,862
- That's not good.

5
00:00:11,862 --> 00:00:13,937
Is it not what you were
expecting, to chatting to?

6
00:00:13,937 --> 00:00:15,636
- No, I like this stuff,
I'm super into it.

7
00:00:15,636 --> 00:00:18,948
Let me show you, let
me show you, like this.

8
00:00:18,948 --> 00:00:20,384
What do you think of that,
Babeth, does that hurt?

9
00:00:20,384 --> 00:00:21,496
- [Erik] If you break his neck you know...

10
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:23,102
- Or are you good?

11
00:00:23,102 --> 00:00:24,059
- Yeah, yeah that hurts.

12
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:24,970
- That hurts right?

13
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,227
- When you went lower, yeah.

14
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,171
- And I'm not really, this right?

15
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:29,088
- Yeah.

16
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:30,354
- Erik, lemme see yours.

17
00:00:30,354 --> 00:00:31,927
No, it's fine it's fine!

18
00:00:31,927 --> 00:00:33,648
No, no come on, stop.

19
00:00:33,648 --> 00:00:34,701
- I don't even like massages.

20
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,748
- I don't give a shit.

21
00:00:35,748 --> 00:00:38,665
(bass heavy music)

22
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:46,308
(ethereal music)

23
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:50,324
- What's up vlog?

24
00:00:50,324 --> 00:00:51,574
Here in London.

25
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:57,455
Just got in from L.A., we're
headed to a client meeting.

26
00:00:58,303 --> 00:01:00,136
Just wrapping up, been

27
00:01:01,385 --> 00:01:04,010
fighting a cold all week.

28
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,906
So, that's been interesting, kind of ...

29
00:01:07,906 --> 00:01:11,645
But, lot of good stuff,
super fired up for 18.

30
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:12,812
Super focused.

31
00:01:14,524 --> 00:01:16,857
If you've noticed, less posts on Instagram

32
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:19,857
the last week or two, just really in

33
00:01:20,756 --> 00:01:21,589
CEO mode.

34
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:25,783
Feeling really good about
that, got a lot done

35
00:01:25,783 --> 00:01:29,742
in the last couple of weeks of the year.

36
00:01:29,742 --> 00:01:31,936
Headed now to see a senior client.

37
00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:34,990
Got client meetings here in London

38
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,740
until tonight, the holiday party.

39
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:41,291
Babin you should interview
peeps for the holiday party.

40
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,458
That'll be a good episode.

41
00:01:46,214 --> 00:01:48,964
(ethereal music)

42
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,309
- What up vlog, it's me, taking control.

43
00:02:03,309 --> 00:02:06,201
Babin's been doing a great
job behind the scenes.

44
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:07,906
Most of this episode's
gonna be the holiday party,

45
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:09,949
I'm sure he's gonna transition to it now.

46
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:10,993
But, we've been doing a shit load

47
00:02:10,994 --> 00:02:12,939
of meetings, it's going super well.

48
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:13,992
I don't know what Babin's been doing.

49
00:02:13,992 --> 00:02:15,223
What have you been doing?

50
00:02:15,223 --> 00:02:16,152
- Standing around.

51
00:02:16,152 --> 00:02:17,043
- No but really.

52
00:02:17,043 --> 00:02:18,183
- I'm just kinda standing around.

53
00:02:18,183 --> 00:02:19,083
- Fuck.
- (laughs)

54
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,370
- So, this is unbelievable to me.

55
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,425
I've had a bad back my whole life,

56
00:02:23,425 --> 00:02:27,342
cause I hurt it at 18 at
my dad's liquor store.

57
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:31,041
That's right, out of everything
I've ever done in my life,

58
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,958
in the last three weeks, six weeks,

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,495
there's this stick that Erik
saw me using with my trainer

60
00:02:38,495 --> 00:02:40,225
in Sweden, Sweden?

61
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:41,058
Where were we?

62
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:42,297
Stockholm.

63
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:44,880
Rolling, soft tissue work, like

64
00:02:46,104 --> 00:02:47,354
tissue quality,

65
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:52,281
has changed my life,
and when I think about

66
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:55,888
all the massages, all the
stretching, all the working out,

67
00:02:55,888 --> 00:03:00,300
that Jordan, taking what
is a stick, in essence,

68
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,050
and like rolling my
adduct, rolling, rolling.

69
00:03:05,211 --> 00:03:07,858
I literally tell Jordan every two days

70
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:10,911
the world needs to know
about, I feel like there's

71
00:03:10,911 --> 00:03:12,244
no conversation.

72
00:03:13,814 --> 00:03:18,435
Neck, neck, has been huge
cause I travel so much

73
00:03:18,435 --> 00:03:21,047
and sleep, I don't know if
you've started feeling this.

74
00:03:21,047 --> 00:03:24,173
Like when you sleep in awkward ...

75
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:27,240
- Even if it's fully laid back,
it's never been comfortable.

76
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,501
- Ready for this?

77
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:30,895
Six months ago when we first realized it,

78
00:03:30,895 --> 00:03:34,970
if I touched what I'm touching right now,

79
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,224
the way I'm touching right
now, it was massive pain.

80
00:03:39,224 --> 00:03:40,288
- That's not good.

81
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:42,366
Is this not what you were
expecting, to be chatting to.

82
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:44,165
- No I like this stuff, I'm super into it.

83
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:45,709
Let me show you, let me show you.

84
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:48,173
Like this, what do you
think of that Babeth?

85
00:03:48,173 --> 00:03:49,006
Does that hurt?

86
00:03:49,006 --> 00:03:50,266
- [Erik] If you break
his neck, you know ...

87
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:51,212
- Or are you good?

88
00:03:51,212 --> 00:03:52,617
- Yeah, yeah, that hurts.

89
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:53,450
- That hurts right?

90
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,604
- When you went lower, yeah.

91
00:03:54,604 --> 00:03:56,450
- And I'm not really, this right?

92
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,600
- Yeah.

93
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,364
- Erik, lemme see yours.

94
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,048
No, it's fine, it's fine!

95
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:02,191
No, no, come on, stop.

96
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:03,270
- I don't even like massages.

97
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,061
- I don't give a shit, let
me just see it real quick.

98
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:05,894
Let me, no actually.

99
00:04:05,894 --> 00:04:07,651
- I've never seen a guy so uncomfortable.

100
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:08,484
What about this, Erik?

101
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:09,429
Does that hurt or no?

102
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:10,262
- No.

103
00:04:10,262 --> 00:04:14,039
- Yeah, you don't have
neck problems do you?

104
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,956
Let me see.

105
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:17,122
- This is like.

106
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:17,954
- I wanna see.

107
00:04:17,954 --> 00:04:20,090
- Like I put it out there.

108
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:21,394
Holy shit, dude.

109
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,657
- Without any problems.

110
00:04:22,657 --> 00:04:23,655
- Let me see yours, Erik.

111
00:04:23,655 --> 00:04:25,344
One more time, we need it for the vlog.

112
00:04:25,344 --> 00:04:27,094
This was really good.

113
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,102
- You're like easy.

114
00:04:31,102 --> 00:04:33,545
- Erik, lemme see yours, come on.

115
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:35,874
Cause yours is really bad, right?

116
00:04:35,874 --> 00:04:38,468
My jeans are so tight.

117
00:04:38,468 --> 00:04:39,456
- [Erik] But I know I'm gonna lose.

118
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:41,605
- This is incredible.

119
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:45,519
I used to not be able to, I
used to be here when I started.

120
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,960
- We're not bending our knees right?

121
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,642
- [Gary] No bending knees.

122
00:04:49,642 --> 00:04:51,319
- Damn, come on!

123
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,152
- You can go further.

124
00:04:52,152 --> 00:04:53,354
- You're not even trying.

125
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:55,847
- You're not trying, you're
doing it for effect, go.

126
00:04:55,847 --> 00:04:56,914
- This is as far as I go.

127
00:04:56,914 --> 00:04:57,904
- (laughs)

128
00:04:57,904 --> 00:04:59,191
- [Gary] You know that's
hamstrings, right?

129
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:00,024
- I know.

130
00:05:00,024 --> 00:05:00,996
- Yeah.

131
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:02,329
- It's great.

132
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:04,800
- What about you, Babeth?

133
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,633
Come on.

134
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,791
No, no, you bent your knees
a little bit too much.

135
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:09,987
Start again.

136
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:11,389
No, stop bending your knees bro.

137
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:12,222
- I'm trying!

138
00:05:12,222 --> 00:05:14,024
- [Gary] Kick your ass back out.

139
00:05:14,024 --> 00:05:14,918
- I'm locked in.

140
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:17,141
- [Gary] Okay, pretty good man.

141
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:18,059
Why is yours so good?

142
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:19,722
- It's, I can feel it's tight.

143
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:21,527
- [Gary] No, that was pretty
good, did you see, Erik?

144
00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:22,569
He's a disaster.

145
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:25,319
(ethereal music)

146
00:05:44,331 --> 00:05:46,342
- I'm sure you get it all the
time, much respect, brother.

147
00:05:46,342 --> 00:05:48,544
There, I hopefully can get that energy.

148
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:50,210
- Thank you.
- No, seriously.

149
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,043
- What's your name?
- Ian.

150
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:52,095
- Ian, thanks for saying what's up.

151
00:05:52,095 --> 00:05:52,928
- You know what, blessings brother.

152
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:54,407
You spend a lot of time with people.

153
00:05:54,407 --> 00:05:55,670
- Thank you brother, have a good holiday.

154
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,503
- Amazing, you too.

155
00:05:56,503 --> 00:05:57,836
- Thank you man.

156
00:05:58,962 --> 00:06:01,260
- So we're here on the
boat, which has become

157
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,777
a London office tradition,
and it's going super well.

158
00:06:05,777 --> 00:06:08,099
Having meeting with Raiza, on my team.

159
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:09,335
I don't think you caught that, did you

160
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,254
catch any of that feed, bro?

161
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:12,504
Bad job, Babin.

162
00:06:13,615 --> 00:06:17,261
The BJB is my favorite,
the "bad job Babin."

163
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:21,080
Anyway, planning a lot of
the Asia stuff with Raiza.

164
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,321
Now we're about to give the awards,

165
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:27,025
which the London office does,
so I'm excited for that.

166
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:28,858
Just a productive day.

167
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:35,448
- Best ex-pat to integrate
into British culture.

168
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,501
Let's see who that is.

169
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:43,168
Okay, and the winner is, Claire!

170
00:06:44,913 --> 00:06:47,496
(crowd cheers)

171
00:06:51,205 --> 00:06:52,038
- Yeah.

172
00:06:54,694 --> 00:06:56,725
- And the correct pronunciation is gif.

173
00:06:56,725 --> 00:06:59,225
(crowd roars)

174
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,481
- Brett!

175
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:04,564
(cheers)

176
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,837
- The hard work, the efforts, the passion

177
00:07:12,837 --> 00:07:15,254
that everybody put into 2017,

178
00:07:16,506 --> 00:07:20,012
you guys saw an email
from me a couple weeks ago

179
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:24,064
just alluding to how
excited about 2018 I was,

180
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:27,582
we've had an enormous amount
of pretty substantial wins

181
00:07:27,582 --> 00:07:30,496
that we'll start announcing
over the next couple weeks,

182
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:33,189
which is great, but it's funny

183
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:36,115
I got to say a very similar
thing to Chattanooga

184
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:38,646
from a different angle.

185
00:07:38,646 --> 00:07:41,368
When I look across at what we're doing,

186
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:44,480
and I think about 2017
as I think everybody does

187
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,916
this time of year you start
to reminisce a little bit.

188
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:51,504
Something very exciting happened
in London this year for me.

189
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,197
What's really exciting to
me, and I think a lot about

190
00:07:54,197 --> 00:07:57,614
what Erik and Ryan and Jenna put into it,

191
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:02,568
and the rest of you, the
thing that excites me the most

192
00:08:02,568 --> 00:08:04,068
is the great flaw.

193
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:08,881
This is gonna be very narrow,
I know not everybody's

194
00:08:08,881 --> 00:08:12,481
into Star Wars, but it just came out.

195
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:15,562
Much like the Death Star,
where there's this one random

196
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,487
completely ridiculous flaw in the system

197
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:22,772
of the ultimate machine, I
really do thing of Vayner media

198
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:26,072
ironically in a Death Star way,

199
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:29,325
I really do think we're gonna win.

200
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:31,505
I do wanna destroy the world.

201
00:08:31,505 --> 00:08:32,337
(crowd laughs)

202
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:33,674
So, congrats, you're part of it!

203
00:08:33,674 --> 00:08:35,424
I'm just so grateful,

204
00:08:36,835 --> 00:08:40,698
and so thankful because
what we've been able to do,

205
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:43,368
and lemme rephrase, what
you've been able to do

206
00:08:43,368 --> 00:08:47,095
in this office, on the thing
that I'm most fearful of,

207
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:49,602
which is how do you guys
play with each other

208
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:53,944
when you're on different
sides of the ball,

209
00:08:53,944 --> 00:08:58,512
has given me enormous
confidence and has made me

210
00:08:58,512 --> 00:09:02,746
greedy on our capabilities
over the next decade

211
00:09:02,746 --> 00:09:05,567
and definitely going into the new year.

212
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:08,249
I will tell you that the
last hundred or so days,

213
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:12,753
150 days of this office,
re-setting and getting

214
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:17,142
their North star, and working
collaboratively in this world,

215
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:21,159
is a bigger feat, and
a more impactful feat

216
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,423
than you realize, because it allows a CEO

217
00:09:23,423 --> 00:09:26,952
who's disproportionately navigating

218
00:09:26,952 --> 00:09:29,669
a lot of excitement on
what we're capable of,

219
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,223
and so, I thank you guys very, very much.

220
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:36,391
From the department heads,
to the person that started

221
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:39,189
the most recently, that's on this boat,

222
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:42,069
it's a very, very, very big deal.

223
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:45,157
It is truly our kryptonite, it is truly

224
00:09:45,157 --> 00:09:47,519
our only vulnerability, because

225
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,487
everything else I truly
believe, is on its way.

226
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:53,553
We are on the right side of history.

227
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:55,225
We do things that we believe in.

228
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:58,360
For me, holiday parties
are easy, it's fun,

229
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,577
everybody's unwinding,
but I pay attention,

230
00:10:00,577 --> 00:10:03,295
I've been to about 30 of em at this point.

231
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:05,514
I'm very, very, very happy with

232
00:10:05,514 --> 00:10:09,097
the tone of this office,
with the ambition.

233
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:13,258
I hope you enjoy the rest
of the night, thanks.

234
00:10:13,258 --> 00:10:15,508
(applause)

235
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:22,948
- Hey.

236
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:23,843
- [Passerby] New York City!

237
00:10:23,843 --> 00:10:24,676
- Yeah.

238
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:27,924
- I was totally disappointed.

239
00:10:27,924 --> 00:10:28,757
- Really?

240
00:10:28,757 --> 00:10:32,667
- [Passerby] It all goes
much better when you have...

241
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:33,500
in a U.S. city.

242
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,344
- That is the most ludicrous shit

243
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:35,331
I've ever heard in my life.

244
00:10:35,331 --> 00:10:37,561
- Oh, I'm sorry, I'm a Jets
fan, look at the Vikings.

245
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:38,394
Where are we going?

246
00:10:38,394 --> 00:10:39,605
- I like the Vikings.

247
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,091
- Oh okay, then I retract that statement.

248
00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:44,342
- (laughs) Are you a Vikings fan?

249
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:45,175
- Yeah.

250
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:46,106
- I'm rooting for them heavily.

251
00:10:46,106 --> 00:10:47,581
- Let's go Case right?

252
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:50,878
- Casey Keeton (laughs), I love him.

253
00:10:50,878 --> 00:10:52,190
Casual 14 hours in London.

254
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,880
Just got a bunch of bad news from

255
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,463
some business losses,
so I'm fuckin pissed,

256
00:10:58,816 --> 00:11:01,233
for about another 13 seconds.

257
00:11:02,264 --> 00:11:03,983
That's where I'm at.

258
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:07,094
11:38, walking in the cold in London,

259
00:11:07,094 --> 00:11:10,344
fuckin angry (laughs).

260
00:11:11,541 --> 00:00:00,000
(inspirational music)
