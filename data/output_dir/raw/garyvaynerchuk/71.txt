1
00:00:00,314 --> 00:00:01,888
- This is the keynote I gave in Stockholm,

2
00:00:01,888 --> 00:00:05,604
crushed the crowd because that's
just how I do in Stockholm.

3
00:00:05,604 --> 00:00:06,604
They call it a syndrome.

4
00:00:06,604 --> 00:00:07,705
What is the Stockholm syndrome?

5
00:00:07,705 --> 00:00:09,161
- I literally said that to my mom today

6
00:00:09,161 --> 00:00:11,363
and I don't even know
if I used it correctly.

7
00:00:11,363 --> 00:00:12,594
- Can somebody Google it while I,

8
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:13,997
'cause I'm using this intro, anyway.

9
00:00:13,997 --> 00:00:15,697
- Hey Siri, what is
the Stockholm syndrome?

10
00:00:15,697 --> 00:00:16,763
- Oh voice baby, voice.

11
00:00:16,763 --> 00:00:20,405
- [Siri] Stockholm syndrome
is a condition that causes

12
00:00:20,405 --> 00:00:22,662
hostages to develop a
psychological alliance

13
00:00:22,662 --> 00:00:24,741
with their captors as
a survival strategy--

14
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:25,743
- Cool.

15
00:00:25,743 --> 00:00:26,744
You guys are my hostages.

16
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:27,577
- [Siri] You want to hear more?

17
00:00:27,577 --> 00:00:28,410
(laughing)

18
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,243
- Yeah, I get it.

19
00:00:29,243 --> 00:00:31,822
Stockholm syndrome (laughing),

20
00:00:31,822 --> 00:00:33,076
wow that's cool.

21
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:35,285
Watch this keynote,
tell me what you think.

22
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:38,285
(upbeat rock music)

23
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:43,445
Hey Stockholm.

24
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:44,636
- [Audience Member] What's up?

25
00:00:44,636 --> 00:00:45,807
- What's up?

26
00:00:45,807 --> 00:00:47,422
Very excited to be here.

27
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:51,048
Want to talk about the one
thing that I'm positive

28
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:53,482
that we are all connected by.

29
00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:57,164
I think one of the challenges
that I have as somebody

30
00:00:57,164 --> 00:01:00,262
who likes to do speeches
is that I'm obsessed

31
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:02,610
with being consumer centric, right?

32
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,804
At the end of the day, I
think every success I have

33
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:08,154
comes far more from humility and listening

34
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:10,676
than it does from my big
mouth and all my talking

35
00:01:10,676 --> 00:01:13,991
and things of that nature
and one of the keys

36
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,865
that I think a lot about when
I speak is getting a sense

37
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:19,557
of who's in the audience
and reverse engineering.

38
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:22,819
Obviously I can't give
the same speech to a room

39
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:25,530
full of 22 year old founders
that are trying to build

40
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,895
machine learning companies
as I can to a bunch

41
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:31,880
of 16 year olds who are
trading crypto currency

42
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,306
in the same way that I can't
to a 48 year old executive

43
00:01:34,306 --> 00:01:37,707
Fortune 500 CMO crowd and so
I'm always kind of weaving.

44
00:01:37,707 --> 00:01:39,175
I have a thesis.

45
00:01:39,175 --> 00:01:40,519
It's very simple.

46
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:41,794
It's right there.

47
00:01:41,794 --> 00:01:43,023
I day trade attention.

48
00:01:43,023 --> 00:01:45,124
It is going to be the core
of what I want to talk

49
00:01:45,124 --> 00:01:47,553
to you about because it's
the only thing that if you're

50
00:01:47,553 --> 00:01:49,757
in here as an executive or B to B,

51
00:01:49,757 --> 00:01:51,811
how many people here are in B to B?

52
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:52,843
The B to B space?

53
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:54,008
Raise your hands high.

54
00:01:54,008 --> 00:01:55,010
Great.

55
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,046
B to C?

56
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:57,049
Great.

57
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:58,050
How many people here are entrepreneurs

58
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,059
and own their own business?

59
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:00,112
Raise your hand.

60
00:02:00,112 --> 00:02:01,113
Great.

61
00:02:01,113 --> 00:02:02,440
How many don't and they work somewhere?

62
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,509
Great.

63
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:04,819
50, 50, 50, 50.

64
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:05,821
Right?

65
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:08,893
So I think what's very scary
about that in my ambition

66
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:11,910
that everybody here
enjoys the talk is that

67
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,784
there's a lot of nuances and
practicalities that play out

68
00:02:15,784 --> 00:02:18,760
very differently but the
one thing that 100% connects

69
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,479
every single person in
this room is the need

70
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:24,592
to get somebody's attention
before they tell them

71
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:26,311
how good their thing is.

72
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:28,413
Whether you're sitting
here and very altruistic

73
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:30,857
and are trying to raise
money for a non profit

74
00:02:30,857 --> 00:02:33,477
or if you want to sell a bottle of wine,

75
00:02:33,477 --> 00:02:36,421
it's all the same game,
which is very simply

76
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:38,411
where is the attention?

77
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:40,877
How do you then communicate in
that environment contextually

78
00:02:40,877 --> 00:02:42,917
to the attention?

79
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:47,311
And then, can you create the
output that you're looking for?

80
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:49,350
I spend a lot of time in this.

81
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,462
I've spent a lot of time
in this my whole life.

82
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,926
When I was six years old and
moved to Edison, New Jersey,

83
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:57,232
for a lot of you that
don't know me, I was born

84
00:02:57,232 --> 00:02:59,513
in the Soviet Union,
immigrated to the United States

85
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,085
when I was three, lived
a very humble life,

86
00:03:02,085 --> 00:03:05,781
studio apartment, seven
family members, you know,

87
00:03:05,781 --> 00:03:10,263
spent my first 18 years
taking one family vacation.

88
00:03:10,263 --> 00:03:13,367
Basically after I was 11
or 12 years old had to buy

89
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:15,232
everything for myself.

90
00:03:15,232 --> 00:03:17,087
Very, very fortunate, to be honest.

91
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:19,865
Taught me really how to get
mine and taught me a lot

92
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:22,049
of the things that have made me successful

93
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:24,532
but the interesting thing
was I was an entrepreneur

94
00:03:24,532 --> 00:03:25,786
right from the beginning.

95
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:27,682
I'm 42 years old and in America,

96
00:03:27,682 --> 00:03:31,421
good grades was the only
way somebody was judged

97
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:35,361
in the 80's and 90's and
I did not have good grades

98
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:38,382
and so for a long period of
my time I was not winning.

99
00:03:38,382 --> 00:03:40,439
I was a losing player.

100
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,075
A lot of my friends'
parents looked down on me

101
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:45,954
because their kids got A's and I got F's

102
00:03:45,954 --> 00:03:48,621
and I used to sit there are
look at them when they would

103
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:50,718
make fun of me, this is the
parents, not making fun of me

104
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:53,430
in a mean way, but they
would make slide comments

105
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,450
and I would sit there and
say, don't you realize

106
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,251
that your straight A kid is
gonna work for me one day.

107
00:03:58,251 --> 00:03:59,364
(laughing)

108
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,531
It's so basic.

109
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,552
Anyway.

110
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:04,798
(audience laughing)

111
00:04:04,798 --> 00:04:07,330
When I was seven years old
and started my first kind of

112
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,018
business, six, seven years
old, it was lemonade stands

113
00:04:10,018 --> 00:04:12,316
which is very cliche in the United States,

114
00:04:12,316 --> 00:04:13,828
but I took a very different approach.

115
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:16,659
I had four or five of
them because I commenced,

116
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:21,237
manipulated my friends to
stand behind them all day

117
00:04:21,237 --> 00:04:23,586
in the summer and sell
lemonade and what I did

118
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:26,576
was I walked up and down
the streets of New Jersey

119
00:04:26,576 --> 00:04:30,560
and I would sit and try
to figure out which tree

120
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,286
and which post and which
sign I could put my signs on

121
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:37,399
and I did that by literally
sitting on the ground

122
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:41,099
and watching cars drive
by for three to four hours

123
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:42,886
in the middle of the summer.

124
00:04:42,886 --> 00:04:44,667
This is what came natural to me.

125
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:48,230
It came natural to me DNA
that I was trying to follow

126
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:52,052
your eyes while you were
driving and try to figure out

127
00:04:52,052 --> 00:04:54,659
was it better to be put
here or here or up there

128
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:57,773
and that's basically been
the story of my life.

129
00:04:57,773 --> 00:04:59,690
Today, today I do that.

130
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:06,167
I try to figure out when
are you gonna spend time

131
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:09,239
on Instagram or Snapchat
or Pinterest or LinkedIn.

132
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:13,362
How soon is it before you
all interact with an Alexa

133
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:17,342
or a Google Home device to
get information or buy things?

134
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:21,860
Where is your attention in
an altruistic, kind of future

135
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,027
world of AR and VR and what
is it about machine learning?

136
00:05:27,236 --> 00:05:28,236
What are we doing?

137
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:29,246
Where are we going?

138
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,812
What happens to restaurants
with self driving cars

139
00:05:31,812 --> 00:05:33,791
if we're gonna eat in there?

140
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,965
How can I story tell to
you when you're driving?

141
00:05:35,965 --> 00:05:39,828
Today, I story tell to
you through voice, right,

142
00:05:39,828 --> 00:05:41,655
because when you're driving, it's passive.

143
00:05:41,655 --> 00:05:42,885
You can consume it.

144
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,103
How does that change?

145
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:46,978
Why is, while everybody's
obsessed with video consumption

146
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:49,353
I'm going and spending
all my time on audio

147
00:05:49,353 --> 00:05:51,553
because I know, actually watch this.

148
00:05:51,553 --> 00:05:53,484
This may be very
interesting for this crowd.

149
00:05:53,484 --> 00:05:55,833
How many people here
are fans of my content

150
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,522
and consume my content
and don't raise your hand

151
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:00,714
because you're trying to
be nice, just if you do,

152
00:06:00,714 --> 00:06:02,084
raise your hands.

153
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:04,008
Alright, first of all, that sucks.

154
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:05,702
(audience laughing)

155
00:06:05,702 --> 00:06:06,704
(laughing)

156
00:06:06,704 --> 00:06:08,079
Alright, one more time, hands up.

157
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,081
Great.

158
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:11,608
Of you, how many of you
in the last year or two

159
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:13,847
have started listening more to the podcast

160
00:06:13,847 --> 00:06:16,062
and watching a little less of the video?

161
00:06:16,062 --> 00:06:17,640
Raise your hands.

162
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,764
That, to me, is the
most interesting thing.

163
00:06:19,764 --> 00:06:20,597
Thank you.

164
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:22,270
That, to me, is the most
interesting thing happening

165
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,744
right now which is, I think,
we're about to live through

166
00:06:24,744 --> 00:06:27,759
the explosion of voice and
I'll get to that in a minute

167
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,543
but I want to go back because
there's so many people

168
00:06:29,543 --> 00:06:31,001
in the B to B space.

169
00:06:31,001 --> 00:06:33,367
What day trading attention
means is that everything

170
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:34,921
that you're gonna hear
coming out of my mouth

171
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:39,443
around voice, Instagram,
influencers, Facebook,

172
00:06:39,443 --> 00:06:43,751
in this moment has the potential
to not matter tomorrow.

173
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:46,672
I doubt it because it usually
takes a little more time

174
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,842
but literally 15 months ago I made a video

175
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:53,332
saying that Instagram was
in trouble, that Snapchat

176
00:06:53,332 --> 00:06:55,652
was growing very quickly
and starting to penetrate

177
00:06:55,652 --> 00:06:58,538
30 year olds, that
Facebook was much bigger

178
00:06:58,538 --> 00:07:01,106
than people realized at a younger age,

179
00:07:01,106 --> 00:07:03,466
and that I did not see a
place for Instagram to play

180
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:06,787
as Snapchat started
winning that generation.

181
00:07:06,787 --> 00:07:10,060
Literally a month later,
and I didn't know this,

182
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,919
they came out with all the
features that Snapchat has

183
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:16,018
and here we are 15 months
later but basically after

184
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:19,598
I made the video it was
literally 100 days later

185
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:22,931
that Instagram became the
most important platform

186
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:26,851
of attention and that's
why I call it day trading

187
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:29,232
where I used to call it,
if you came to a talk

188
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:31,722
five years ago that slide
would have said market

189
00:07:31,722 --> 00:07:33,494
in the year that you live in, right?

190
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,056
My thesis is that most of you,

191
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:38,486
especially in the B to B space
are wasting an ungodly amount

192
00:07:38,486 --> 00:07:41,078
of time and money and energy
on places where people

193
00:07:41,078 --> 00:07:43,899
are not paying attention
because of history and tradition

194
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:46,621
and that's how you've always done it

195
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:49,013
and that you're underspending
where their attention

196
00:07:49,013 --> 00:07:50,887
actually is and that's
where the arbitrage is,

197
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,355
that's the opportunity.

198
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:55,354
That is where I and people
that trade the way I do

199
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:57,665
make their wealth, build their businesses

200
00:07:57,665 --> 00:08:00,602
but I had to change it
from marketing in the year

201
00:08:00,602 --> 00:08:02,164
that you live in to day trading attention

202
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:04,122
because everything's happening so fast.

203
00:08:04,122 --> 00:08:07,456
It's unbelievable to me
how big of a deal this is

204
00:08:07,456 --> 00:08:09,223
and how quickly it's changing.

205
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:10,777
But here are some of the
frameworks I understand.

206
00:08:10,777 --> 00:08:13,864
For everybody in this room,
if you do not produce content

207
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:17,478
and story tell on this
device, you are becoming

208
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:21,476
unbelievably irrelevant by the minute.

209
00:08:21,476 --> 00:08:26,250
If you do not understand
how to take your brochure

210
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,608
or your booth at a trade
conference or your print ad

211
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:33,990
in a catalog and convert
it to being relevant

212
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,556
to on here, you are becoming
increasingly irrelevant.

213
00:08:38,556 --> 00:08:40,876
The biggest mistake that
this room is gonna make

214
00:08:40,876 --> 00:08:43,808
is they're gonna say things
like, but my 59 year old

215
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:47,059
target audience isn't living on there

216
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,455
and they will make grave
business mistakes over the next

217
00:08:50,455 --> 00:08:54,149
three to four years based on
their romantic point of view

218
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:56,953
on technology instead of the reality

219
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,676
of what's actually happening.

220
00:08:58,676 --> 00:09:01,110
My friends, I think in only practicality.

221
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,166
I was brought up in an
environment where eventually

222
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,435
after having a successful
baseball card business

223
00:09:06,435 --> 00:09:08,854
that I was making three to
4,000 dollars a weekend in,

224
00:09:08,854 --> 00:09:12,297
I was dragged into my dad's
liquor store and had to help

225
00:09:12,297 --> 00:09:13,987
build that family business.

226
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,413
I built my dad's business
from a three to a 60 million

227
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:19,313
dollar business in a
very short period of time

228
00:09:19,313 --> 00:09:23,279
on the back of making every
penny work like a dollar.

229
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,400
My dad's business was doing
3.7 million dollars in sales

230
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,602
on 10% gross profit, which
means we had $370,000

231
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:33,116
before expenses and I built
that business from that base

232
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:37,408
to 60 million in five
years with no MNA, no VCs,

233
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:40,003
because what I did was
I day trading attention.

234
00:09:40,003 --> 00:09:44,912
In 1996 to 2001, that meant
two big bets that I made.

235
00:09:44,912 --> 00:09:46,079
One was email.

236
00:09:47,148 --> 00:09:49,293
How many people here
have done email marketing

237
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:50,295
in their careers?

238
00:09:50,295 --> 00:09:51,298
Raise your hands.

239
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:52,572
Please raise them high,
I want to get a sense.

240
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:54,040
Great.

241
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,561
So you'll love this.

242
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:59,728
In 1996 I had an email newsletter
that had 91% open rates.

243
00:10:02,007 --> 00:10:05,340
It had 91% open rates not
because it was so incredible

244
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,739
what I was writing in there.

245
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,810
I was writing, buy this wine, click here.

246
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,442
It was incredible because
nobody was doing email marketing

247
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:14,708
in 1996.

248
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,161
It was a new phenomenon.

249
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:19,021
How many people had email in 1998?

250
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:20,639
Raise your hands.

251
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,383
Great, so for the youngsters
you're about to learn something

252
00:10:22,383 --> 00:10:24,691
because most of this
stuff you don't even know.

253
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:28,326
In 1998 youngsters, this
is how email happened.

254
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:31,285
Somebody would send an
email and us old folk

255
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:35,581
we would open and read
every single fucking email.

256
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:37,646
(audience laughing)

257
00:10:37,646 --> 00:10:39,644
The supply and demand of attention.

258
00:10:39,644 --> 00:10:42,180
It was a new medium and
all of us traded email

259
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,902
the way we traded mail,
you had to kind of properly

260
00:10:44,902 --> 00:10:45,949
look at it.

261
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:47,784
We now no longer do that.

262
00:10:47,784 --> 00:10:51,408
We now care so much about
our time that the reason

263
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:54,086
we don't unsubscribe from
newsletters that we don't read

264
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,524
anymore is because it
takes longer to unsubscribe

265
00:10:56,524 --> 00:10:59,409
than it does to just delete.

266
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,768
It is time arbitrage.

267
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:03,185
It is attention and this is how we play.

268
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:05,753
The second bet I made
happened a little bit later.

269
00:11:05,753 --> 00:11:10,318
When I started winelibrary.com
Google didn't exist

270
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:12,673
so it's just fascinating to think about

271
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,377
very much the themes of the
gentleman right before me

272
00:11:15,377 --> 00:11:18,679
about how early this is,
how much we don't know,

273
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,887
that's how I think about marketing.

274
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:23,598
Google didn't exist for most of this room

275
00:11:23,598 --> 00:11:25,964
when we started our careers.

276
00:11:25,964 --> 00:11:29,046
The internet didn't exist
for most of the people

277
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:31,608
in this room so I've lived
a life where everything

278
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,311
was a fad, not just Snapchat,
the whole fucking internet

279
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:38,965
was a fad when I started my
career and so what's fascinating

280
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,533
to me is the next bet I
made was Google AdWords.

281
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,788
Google AdWords had come out
and for five cents a click

282
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,136
before they raised the
minimum to 10 cents,

283
00:11:47,136 --> 00:11:49,998
I was buying up every wine
term and I was able to buy

284
00:11:49,998 --> 00:11:53,939
words like wine and cabernet
and champagne for five

285
00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:58,733
and 10 cents a click and
very honestly it is one

286
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:00,869
of the best things I ever did in my career

287
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:02,447
and it is no question
one of the worst things

288
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:03,774
I ever did in my career.

289
00:12:03,774 --> 00:12:06,447
I bet very big and it worked very great

290
00:12:06,447 --> 00:12:10,286
but I was young and I
was doing everything,

291
00:12:10,286 --> 00:12:13,818
direct mail, print, radio, television.

292
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:17,082
I was branding, I was
marketing but I underspent

293
00:12:17,082 --> 00:12:18,582
on Google AdWords.

294
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:22,520
I had, I always like to say,
I had the best hand in poker

295
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,437
and I didn't go all in.

296
00:12:25,337 --> 00:12:28,373
It was working but I didn't
understand at that point

297
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:31,212
in my career how much it
was working and when I hear

298
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:33,102
like somebody introduced me and say,

299
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:35,658
from three to 60 million
dollars and it's impressive

300
00:12:35,658 --> 00:12:37,870
and I'm glad and I love
it and it's my family,

301
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,225
it matters to me, but
every time I hear it,

302
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:44,177
I say to myself, it should have been 200.

303
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:46,707
And I'll tell you, it's why
I stand here in front of you

304
00:12:46,707 --> 00:12:48,795
and I want to use that as a segue to why,

305
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:52,871
and the light is powerful
but I want to see your faces,

306
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:54,974
I need everybody to understand this,

307
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,763
I don't care if you're
selling to 17 farmers

308
00:12:57,763 --> 00:13:01,013
a one million dollar aggregation system

309
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,840
in a B to B environment,

310
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,072
every person in this
room has to understand

311
00:13:08,072 --> 00:13:12,239
how unbelievably under priced
and how unbelievably powerful

312
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:16,584
Facebook advertising is right now.

313
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:20,874
Right this second, the
scalable, under priced attention

314
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:24,215
in our society, and by the
way, if you were doing business

315
00:13:24,215 --> 00:13:28,407
in the Nordics, it's an
even better deal than it is

316
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:31,494
in the U.S. because it's a
marketplace and it only reacts,

317
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:35,310
I love you guys for that, it
only reacts to how much money

318
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,447
you guys pump into the system.

319
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:42,447
When BMW and Sass and
Coca Cola actually wake up

320
00:13:44,027 --> 00:13:48,221
and understand how under
priced Facebook's ads are,

321
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:51,515
the price of Facebook
ads is going to skyrocket

322
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:55,041
and you will regret, like
I do, in not spending money

323
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,397
in it today.

324
00:13:56,397 --> 00:13:58,506
There is an unbelievable
amount of people in this room

325
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:01,782
who have opinions on how
Facebook works for their business

326
00:14:01,782 --> 00:14:04,699
without ever running a Facebook ad.

327
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:11,007
We are making headline reading
and emotional decisions

328
00:14:11,007 --> 00:14:13,425
about the current state of
marketing and opportunity.

329
00:14:13,425 --> 00:14:16,841
We are not relying
enough on practitioners.

330
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:21,063
I have watched people buy
100 million dollar contracts

331
00:14:21,063 --> 00:14:23,081
from one Facebook ad.

332
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:24,460
I've seen it.

333
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,976
Not I guessed it, I heard about it.

334
00:14:25,976 --> 00:14:29,688
We work with the GEs and the
SAPs and the biggest brands

335
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:30,972
in the world.

336
00:14:30,972 --> 00:14:32,643
We are grossly underestimating.

337
00:14:32,643 --> 00:14:34,912
It's amazing to me that people
sit around and talk about

338
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:38,242
Trump and Brexit and Arab
Spring and these macro,

339
00:14:38,242 --> 00:14:42,409
unbelievable, historic
cultural shifts in our society

340
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:45,809
and then an hour later
when they talk about

341
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:49,220
their little business,
their 100 million dollar,

342
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,622
500 million dollar, one billion dollar,

343
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:54,372
10 billion dollar little business

344
00:14:55,255 --> 00:14:57,026
and they don't think
Facebook can affect it.

345
00:14:57,026 --> 00:15:00,859
It is unbelievable naivety
and that's at best.

346
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:05,955
At worst, you are being grossly negligent

347
00:15:05,955 --> 00:15:09,354
in how you're running your
business out of the laziness

348
00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:12,644
to not become educated on
what is actually happening

349
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:13,644
in our game.

350
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,580
So, I'm fascinated by this.

351
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,487
I think this is the great opportunity.

352
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:21,849
This is a generational situation.

353
00:15:21,849 --> 00:15:24,391
If you look at the history
of marketing, television,

354
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:28,079
radio, the internet, now
the social layer on top

355
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,178
of the internet, every
time there is a huge shift

356
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:34,374
of attention somewhere new,
enormous wealth is made

357
00:15:34,374 --> 00:15:36,707
and enormous wealth is lost.

358
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,137
And this, my friends, is
the biggest of them all.

359
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:43,852
The amount of attention
shifting is extraordinary.

360
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:45,638
But I want you to hear something.

361
00:15:45,638 --> 00:15:47,718
I do not believe that this
is about traditional media

362
00:15:47,718 --> 00:15:49,307
versus digital media.

363
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:53,193
For example, one of the great
wastes of money in the world

364
00:15:53,193 --> 00:15:56,553
is buying programmatic
banner ads and pre-rolls

365
00:15:56,553 --> 00:16:00,872
across the web for five dollar
CPMs because it's cheap.

366
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:03,455
I also believe in America, for example,

367
00:16:03,455 --> 00:16:06,672
that the Super Bowl ad that
costs 5.5 million dollars

368
00:16:06,672 --> 00:16:10,540
for 30 seconds is by far
the best deal in marketing

369
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,323
because everybody in America will see it

370
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:16,054
and you get unbelievable awareness.

371
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:18,591
So for me, I'm fascinated by the nuances.

372
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:21,058
I think you can waste all
your money on Facebook

373
00:16:21,058 --> 00:16:24,246
if you don't know how to use it.

374
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:28,163
As a matter of fact,
what's the ROI of a piano?

375
00:16:29,718 --> 00:16:31,883
What's the ROI of a piano?

376
00:16:31,883 --> 00:16:33,089
Let me help you.

377
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:36,753
For Gary Vaynerchuk (clucks tongue) zero.

378
00:16:36,753 --> 00:16:38,586
I can't play for shit.

379
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,335
But for Billy Joel and Elton John,

380
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,029
the ROI was of billions of dollars.

381
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:47,106
The ROI of a basketball is zero for me,

382
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,939
for Lebron, a billion.

383
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:52,310
This is not about does this stuff work,

384
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,402
this is about do you
know what to do with it.

385
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:58,516
And the reality is, you don't
know what to do with it.

386
00:16:58,516 --> 00:17:00,565
The far majority of people
in here have never been

387
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:03,830
practitioners of the
modern day story telling

388
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,061
and media planning and
execution for a business result

389
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:10,182
and that is where the opportunity is.

390
00:17:10,183 --> 00:17:14,277
I'm fascinated by how
big this actually is.

391
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:18,355
I laugh when people don't
understand how much change

392
00:17:18,355 --> 00:17:23,242
is happening and so this
rant, this passion I start

393
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,398
this keynote with is very simple.

394
00:17:25,398 --> 00:17:29,566
It is my hope that one,
one, one person in this room

395
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,573
decides to go back home and
run their business properly

396
00:17:34,573 --> 00:17:36,540
and it's not very complicated.

397
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,966
It's about becoming educated.

398
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:40,599
Education matters.

399
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:43,443
Just the education of the
day always matters more.

400
00:17:43,443 --> 00:17:47,477
The fact that so many of
you have not spent 30 hours,

401
00:17:47,477 --> 00:17:51,783
which is a lot but very
little based on the ambitions

402
00:17:51,783 --> 00:17:54,387
that you have for yourself
or your organizations,

403
00:17:54,387 --> 00:17:58,357
that you've not spent the 30
hours to either read on Google

404
00:17:58,357 --> 00:18:02,986
or watch videos on YouTube to
how to run an Instagram ad,

405
00:18:02,986 --> 00:18:07,153
how to place a Snapchat filter,
how to plan Facebook media

406
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:10,403
and you think that even if you've done it

407
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:14,142
you've outsourced it to a
25 year old who gets it,

408
00:18:14,142 --> 00:18:15,892
is fascinating to me.

409
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:19,096
Who is the biggest advertiser on Google

410
00:18:19,096 --> 00:18:21,971
in the first six years of Google?

411
00:18:21,971 --> 00:18:22,804
Amazon.

412
00:18:24,366 --> 00:18:26,167
Amazon was the biggest
advertiser on Google

413
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:28,957
in the first six years of Google AdWords.

414
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:31,122
It is not a coincidence that
Amazon is one of the biggest

415
00:18:31,122 --> 00:18:32,554
companies in the world.

416
00:18:32,554 --> 00:18:36,721
They used the under priced
attention to build their company.

417
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,552
Who was the biggest
advertiser of television

418
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:42,531
in the prime of the 1970's
and 80's when television

419
00:18:42,531 --> 00:18:45,373
was at scale and under priced?

420
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:47,031
Proctor and Gamble.

421
00:18:47,031 --> 00:18:49,894
It is not a coincidence that Tide and Dove

422
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:53,110
and Proctor and Gamble became
the biggest consumer packaged

423
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,471
goods products in the world.

424
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:57,237
This is very basic.

425
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:59,919
What were the biggest sports
in America in the 1940's

426
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,219
and 50's?

427
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:03,962
Baseball, horse racing, and boxing.

428
00:19:03,962 --> 00:19:08,242
Who also spent the most time
distributing content on radio?

429
00:19:08,242 --> 00:19:11,672
What was the biggest sports in
the last 20 years in America?

430
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:12,826
The NFL.

431
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:15,458
The biggest spender, the
biggest executor of content

432
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,742
in the medium.

433
00:19:16,742 --> 00:19:19,242
The sport matched the content.

434
00:19:20,362 --> 00:19:22,408
There's two young men
right there doing tricks

435
00:19:22,408 --> 00:19:24,989
with soccer balls on
Instagram and YouTube.

436
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:28,396
It's because that content
and that formula works

437
00:19:28,396 --> 00:19:31,057
on that platform and they
didn't have to get signed

438
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:33,675
by somebody to be able
to make that content.

439
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:35,601
They just went direct to the consumer

440
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:38,062
and then Adidas, the
biggest brand in the world

441
00:19:38,062 --> 00:19:40,273
in that sport comes to them

442
00:19:40,273 --> 00:19:43,076
and wants to do business with them.

443
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:46,826
I am fascinated by the
naivety slash audacity

444
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:52,036
of the 99% of people in
the business world today

445
00:19:52,036 --> 00:19:55,864
and their disrespect for social media.

446
00:19:55,864 --> 00:19:57,650
Why don't I help you guys?

447
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,078
Let me help you with something.

448
00:19:59,078 --> 00:20:01,116
The word social media is the problem.

449
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,116
You know that, right?

450
00:20:02,116 --> 00:20:04,631
The problem here is a branding problem.

451
00:20:04,631 --> 00:20:07,047
Social media has a branding problem.

452
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:09,667
When I say the word social
media, for a lot of executives

453
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,726
in this room, especially
you B to B people,

454
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:13,931
that is a nuance.

455
00:20:13,931 --> 00:20:16,045
That is a sprinkle.

456
00:20:16,045 --> 00:20:17,327
That is a nice to have.

457
00:20:17,327 --> 00:20:19,383
That is a it's gonna be here one day

458
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:21,547
but doesn't matter to me.

459
00:20:21,547 --> 00:20:23,480
When I hear the word social
media, I think very simply,

460
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,660
I think this is the remote
control of our society

461
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,795
and I know that 50% of every
minute spent by human beings

462
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:34,357
on earth, zero to 100 years old,

463
00:20:34,357 --> 00:20:36,942
is spent on a social media site.

464
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:37,775
50%.

465
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:42,912
I hear social media, my
brain says, the current state

466
00:20:42,912 --> 00:20:44,245
of the internet.

467
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,603
And I have a funny feeling that
you would have a harder time

468
00:20:48,603 --> 00:20:51,159
betting against the current
state of the internet

469
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:53,745
for your business than social media.

470
00:20:53,745 --> 00:20:56,643
So now I implore you and my hope and dream

471
00:20:56,643 --> 00:20:59,634
is that this audience
starts to think about this

472
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:02,163
just a little bit differently,
not because I'm passionate

473
00:21:02,163 --> 00:21:06,189
and I'm going hard but
because there are truths

474
00:21:06,189 --> 00:21:09,207
in what I'm saying and you
know them and you feel them

475
00:21:09,207 --> 00:21:12,218
and you also know that
you can't call the bluff

476
00:21:12,218 --> 00:21:13,811
one way or the other.

477
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:16,630
Meaning, I'm a big fan of AB testing.

478
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:20,013
If you believe that
your print, your radio,

479
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:24,180
your Google ads, your
sponsorships, your booths at events

480
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:29,043
are better than producing
videos that people

481
00:21:29,043 --> 00:21:31,285
actually want to watch on
Facebook and then retargeting them

482
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:33,847
and putting 'em into a sales
funnel and then closing them,

483
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:36,623
well then you should test them.

484
00:21:36,623 --> 00:21:40,187
To me, the fascination
is how anybody in 2018

485
00:21:40,187 --> 00:21:44,354
is not testing at scale these phenomenons.

486
00:21:44,354 --> 00:21:47,912
And so, I'm trying to put
pressure on the collective system

487
00:21:47,912 --> 00:21:51,068
really, to be very frank
and I hope everybody

488
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:54,037
understands this, none
of you are my clients.

489
00:21:54,037 --> 00:21:57,301
You guys aren't my brothers and sisters.

490
00:21:57,301 --> 00:21:59,571
I'm about to leave Stockholm
very soon and go back

491
00:21:59,571 --> 00:22:00,628
to New York.

492
00:22:00,628 --> 00:22:04,409
I don't give a shit if you do
anything I'm talking about.

493
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:06,347
I really don't.

494
00:22:06,347 --> 00:22:08,189
There's really only two
agendas I have here.

495
00:22:08,189 --> 00:22:11,287
Number one, Tyler's filming
it and in four years

496
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:15,719
when CPM costs on Facebook
are 30 and 40 dollars,

497
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:18,122
I'm just gonna post a
video clip of this moment

498
00:22:18,122 --> 00:22:20,702
and it's gonna say, I told you so.

499
00:22:20,702 --> 00:22:23,402
(audience laughing)

500
00:22:23,402 --> 00:22:26,386
Number two, which has been
much more fruitful for me,

501
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,971
is that when I do this
and I talk this way,

502
00:22:28,971 --> 00:22:33,054
which is practical, not
emphatic, not passionate.

503
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,223
Practical.

504
00:22:37,454 --> 00:22:39,452
I'm talking about what's
actually happening now

505
00:22:39,452 --> 00:22:43,640
and everybody's acting and
executing and spending money

506
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,307
and energy like seven years ago.

507
00:22:47,147 --> 00:22:49,240
This is not futuristic talk.

508
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,241
This is today.

509
00:22:50,241 --> 00:22:51,779
I can talk to you about virtual reality

510
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:53,606
and AR machine learning
and voice all day long.

511
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:55,949
That's not practical for anybody in here.

512
00:22:55,949 --> 00:22:59,940
But selling a contract
in a construction company

513
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,558
on Facebook which seems extremely
foreign to the collective

514
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:06,846
is happening every day for
the two or three practitioners

515
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:10,660
of this skill in that
platform and it's converting

516
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,720
a hell of a lot better
than your direct mail

517
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,096
and all the other shit
you're spending money

518
00:23:15,096 --> 00:23:16,685
and energy on.

519
00:23:16,685 --> 00:23:17,518
Period.

520
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:21,291
But you don't know that
because you haven't tested it.

521
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,361
I have.

522
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:25,807
I run direct mail and
Facebook for Wine Library.

523
00:23:25,807 --> 00:23:28,852
I run direct mail and Facebook
for all my Sass products

524
00:23:28,852 --> 00:23:30,140
that I'm an investor in.

525
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,042
I look at this stuff
everyday and so I say this

526
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:36,388
to have it on the record and number two,

527
00:23:36,388 --> 00:23:38,208
it is an amazing feeling.

528
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,206
When I fly home I will
get an email that says,

529
00:23:41,206 --> 00:23:43,160
four and a half years
ago I was in Alabama,

530
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,688
I heard your talk and I
own this and I did this

531
00:23:45,688 --> 00:23:48,314
and here's my business now.

532
00:23:48,314 --> 00:23:51,727
I'm looking to get my high
from an email that says,

533
00:23:51,727 --> 00:23:54,853
you came to Stockholm in late 2017.

534
00:23:54,853 --> 00:23:57,479
I didn't even know who you
were when you went on stage

535
00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:00,355
but you yelled at me so
aggressively I said, fuck it,

536
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,582
I'll try it.

537
00:24:01,582 --> 00:24:04,576
(audience laughing)

538
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,792
And then this happened.

539
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:08,211
And so that's where I'm at mentally.

540
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:09,210
I'm excited.

541
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,742
I think the thing that
you have to hear from me

542
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,430
is a couple more things
before we get into Q and A

543
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,943
and please, are we using the app here?

544
00:24:14,943 --> 00:24:15,946
I assume we are.

545
00:24:15,946 --> 00:24:18,584
So please, if you've got,
what I would implore right now

546
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:19,956
and then I'll go into the rest of my talk,

547
00:24:19,956 --> 00:24:22,845
is if you have a basic,
social media, digital media,

548
00:24:22,845 --> 00:24:27,057
marketing, branding
101 question, to ask it

549
00:24:27,057 --> 00:24:29,166
because this is the environment to do it.

550
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,167
Right?

551
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:32,151
Because you can see this
theoretical talk on YouTube.

552
00:24:32,151 --> 00:24:34,431
We're here together now so if you have

553
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,602
a very direct question.

554
00:24:36,602 --> 00:24:38,616
I am a lawyer, how the hell
do I use Facebook to get more,

555
00:24:38,616 --> 00:24:39,992
like, please ask right now.

556
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:42,013
Take out your app and
start asking questions

557
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,712
while I keep going
because the Q and A part

558
00:24:44,712 --> 00:24:47,295
that's coming soon is the part.

559
00:24:50,065 --> 00:24:51,654
Here's the part that's tricky.

560
00:24:51,654 --> 00:24:56,353
I'm right on the framework
of where the attention is.

561
00:24:56,353 --> 00:24:59,634
The problem is is if you
go home and spend $5,000

562
00:24:59,634 --> 00:25:02,519
on Facebook ads, the
creative is the variable

563
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:03,852
of your success.

564
00:25:04,726 --> 00:25:08,830
The picture, the video, the
words you write in that post

565
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:12,997
are the difference between
zero sales and 1,000 sales.

566
00:25:14,475 --> 00:25:17,553
Zero dollars in donations
and a million dollars

567
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:18,809
in donations.

568
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:21,767
My vulnerability, my
kryptonite to my thesis

569
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:23,100
is the creative.

570
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:26,252
I have your attention right now.

571
00:25:26,252 --> 00:25:28,766
This would be no different
than Facebook, right?

572
00:25:28,766 --> 00:25:30,524
This framework of the
event we're in right now,

573
00:25:30,524 --> 00:25:32,029
I have your attention.

574
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:33,147
This is a talk.

575
00:25:33,147 --> 00:25:34,171
You came to listen.

576
00:25:34,171 --> 00:25:35,324
You're here.

577
00:25:35,324 --> 00:25:36,768
You're all paying attention-ish.

578
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,802
I see a couple of you on your phone.

579
00:25:38,802 --> 00:25:40,463
Keep doing your thing,
it's more important.

580
00:25:40,463 --> 00:25:44,130
But, if the content of
my speech is not good

581
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:48,176
and not interesting, I've
wasted my opportunity

582
00:25:48,176 --> 00:25:52,095
with my creative to create the
event that I'm looking for.

583
00:25:52,095 --> 00:25:53,097
Right?

584
00:25:53,097 --> 00:25:56,095
So the thing that I'm
very passionate about is

585
00:25:56,095 --> 00:25:58,511
please understand what
is actually happening

586
00:25:58,511 --> 00:26:01,043
in this device and
here's what's happening.

587
00:26:01,043 --> 00:26:04,960
This is a place where
math and data and science

588
00:26:06,229 --> 00:26:10,924
mash into art and creativity
and equally, both of them,

589
00:26:10,924 --> 00:26:13,225
have to be respected.

590
00:26:13,225 --> 00:26:16,314
The short term financial
businesses running in here

591
00:26:16,314 --> 00:26:18,397
care about math too much.

592
00:26:19,476 --> 00:26:23,172
The overally long term and
ideological and artistic

593
00:26:23,172 --> 00:26:26,391
people in this room
are going too over here

594
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:28,821
and not practical about the math.

595
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:31,295
The balance of the two is everything

596
00:26:31,295 --> 00:26:34,711
and the platform of Facebook
and likes and these are

597
00:26:34,711 --> 00:26:37,650
stream mentality sites that
have our attention right now,

598
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,677
Instagram and things of that nature,

599
00:26:39,677 --> 00:26:42,884
is incredibly important to respect both.

600
00:26:42,884 --> 00:26:46,057
For example, talking
about stream dynamics,

601
00:26:46,057 --> 00:26:48,408
Twitter because of the
nature of the context

602
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:52,093
is over priced ads because
the ad prices have a floor

603
00:26:52,093 --> 00:26:54,814
and they're not converting
as well and the attention

604
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:57,257
on Twitter is very different
than it is on Facebook

605
00:26:57,257 --> 00:27:00,599
and Instagram thus making
the inventory over priced,

606
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:03,968
in my opinion as we sit here today.

607
00:27:03,968 --> 00:27:06,972
So, the creative that you
put in Twitter matters just

608
00:27:06,972 --> 00:27:09,504
as much every where else but
if you're paying too much

609
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:11,848
to get in front of somebody,

610
00:27:11,848 --> 00:27:13,776
it's not going to be as valuable.

611
00:27:13,776 --> 00:27:15,602
This is basic supply
and demand of attention

612
00:27:15,602 --> 00:27:18,884
and then framed on top
of it, do you understand

613
00:27:18,884 --> 00:27:21,724
the context of the creative
you have to put into it.

614
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:24,641
Now let me go a little 201 on this.

615
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:28,714
It's super important
for you to do one thing.

616
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,582
It's important for you to do what I did

617
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:33,076
before I took this stage
which is reverse engineer

618
00:27:33,076 --> 00:27:34,159
the audience.

619
00:27:35,573 --> 00:27:37,282
The number one mistake everybody's making

620
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:40,945
on social media content
right now is they're using

621
00:27:40,945 --> 00:27:43,070
the same content and they're spreading it

622
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,538
throughout all the
platforms and they're using

623
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:48,799
socialist distribution
not as a native place

624
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,028
to story tell.

625
00:27:50,028 --> 00:27:51,730
Let me explain.

626
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,140
All of you sitting here,
how many people here

627
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:57,786
consume content on more
than one social network?

628
00:27:57,786 --> 00:27:59,062
Raise your hand.

629
00:27:59,062 --> 00:28:00,396
Fantastic.

630
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:01,591
A majority of this room.

631
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:03,665
So you're gonna understand
this and this is fascinating

632
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:05,735
and after I tell you
this, I can't wait for you

633
00:28:05,735 --> 00:28:08,701
to spend the next day or two
realizing how interesting

634
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:09,951
this nuance is.

635
00:28:12,643 --> 00:28:13,676
I am me.

636
00:28:13,676 --> 00:28:15,676
I'm Gary, right?

637
00:28:15,676 --> 00:28:20,014
When I go into Instagram,
my psychology is different

638
00:28:20,014 --> 00:28:22,347
than when I go into Twitter.

639
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:26,312
My psychology is different
than when I go into Facebook.

640
00:28:26,312 --> 00:28:29,944
Every one of you uses these
platforms differently.

641
00:28:29,944 --> 00:28:32,291
When you're on LinkedIn,
that's an amazing ring.

642
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:34,393
When I go, that's really funny.

643
00:28:34,393 --> 00:28:37,649
When I go into Instagram,
my mindset is younger.

644
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:38,816
It's swaggier.

645
00:28:40,361 --> 00:28:42,891
It is just different.

646
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:44,666
There's a youthfulness.

647
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:45,848
There's a pulse.

648
00:28:45,848 --> 00:28:48,050
There's a cultural
aspect that even the copy

649
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:50,950
that I write with my two
thumbs is different slang

650
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:54,028
than what I would write on LinkedIn,

651
00:28:54,028 --> 00:28:56,278
than what I would write on Twitter,

652
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:58,805
than what I would write on Facebook.

653
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:01,326
Understand that when you
put a picture or words

654
00:29:01,326 --> 00:29:03,765
or video on one of these
platforms, the person

655
00:29:03,765 --> 00:29:06,157
you're trying to reach,
even though you targeted ads

656
00:29:06,157 --> 00:29:09,180
across all of them for
44 to 45 year old women

657
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,903
with two children and
$100,000 income, even though

658
00:29:11,903 --> 00:29:15,592
she's the same person,
her mindset is different

659
00:29:15,592 --> 00:29:19,262
in every platform and
that context, that nuance

660
00:29:19,262 --> 00:29:20,429
is imperative.

661
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,690
You also have to respect the platform.

662
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,027
Instagram is a platform
that only allows you, today,

663
00:29:26,027 --> 00:29:29,878
to make a video that is
only one minute long.

664
00:29:29,878 --> 00:29:32,327
That is a different
story telling restriction

665
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:34,463
than if you're making a
four and a half minute video

666
00:29:34,463 --> 00:29:35,665
on Facebook.

667
00:29:35,665 --> 00:29:37,714
Too many companies that
are advanced in here

668
00:29:37,714 --> 00:29:40,701
will make one video and then edit it down

669
00:29:40,701 --> 00:29:43,756
for the one minute version by
their best half assed efforts

670
00:29:43,756 --> 00:29:46,724
from the four minute version
that they put on Facebook

671
00:29:46,724 --> 00:29:49,340
without creating narratively
for that platform

672
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,780
or deeply understanding
how, what I would call,

673
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,360
DJ the content into the platform.

674
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,973
If you're into music, then
you realize over the last

675
00:29:58,973 --> 00:30:02,307
20 years, we've seen the
growth of DJ culture.

676
00:30:02,307 --> 00:30:04,675
It is a different skillset
than being the person

677
00:30:04,675 --> 00:30:06,673
that creates the original song.

678
00:30:06,673 --> 00:30:10,241
If you become great at
being a DJ off of a piece

679
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,285
of a content to the six
or seven logos that matter

680
00:30:13,285 --> 00:30:15,766
at the bottom of my screen down here,

681
00:30:15,766 --> 00:30:18,954
if you can become a great
DJ, if you can take a piece

682
00:30:18,954 --> 00:30:21,878
of content, if you can
understand what you want to say,

683
00:30:21,878 --> 00:30:25,422
what message are you trying
to make me understand,

684
00:30:25,422 --> 00:30:28,001
use my dentist service.

685
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:29,861
Buy my Sass product.

686
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:30,861
Use my bank.

687
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,808
Hire my law firm.

688
00:30:33,808 --> 00:30:36,591
Work with me, donate for
me, vote for me, buy me,

689
00:30:36,591 --> 00:30:37,985
donate for me.

690
00:30:37,985 --> 00:30:40,669
If you understand what you
are trying to get across

691
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:44,511
and you understand that
it's words, audio, and video

692
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:47,778
in the way we've communicated
for the last 100 plus years,

693
00:30:47,778 --> 00:30:52,064
and you understand how to
respect and I mean really respect

694
00:30:52,064 --> 00:30:55,397
this and this and this and that and that

695
00:30:57,543 --> 00:31:00,929
and understand how they're
different, how they work,

696
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:05,000
inside out, spend the 30 to
40 hours to become educated

697
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,080
on how they work and then
actually with your own fingers

698
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,247
place it, run it, and watch
it, and do that for the next

699
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:17,411
six months, you have a
shot to be successful

700
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:20,317
and if you do not, you
can still be successful

701
00:31:20,317 --> 00:31:23,314
but you're doing it at your own peril.

702
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:26,656
Every day goes by, this
is grabbing attention.

703
00:31:26,656 --> 00:31:28,906
Now, you may not like that.

704
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:33,092
You might be very upset that
the kids are on their phone

705
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:36,583
the whole time but you
have to make me a promise.

706
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:40,532
You have to leave your opinions
about technology at the door

707
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:43,947
when you walk into the
office and run your business

708
00:31:43,947 --> 00:31:48,462
because your romance is gonna
put you out of business.

709
00:31:48,462 --> 00:31:52,671
And, I want to debate you on your romance.

710
00:31:52,671 --> 00:31:56,184
When you go to a restaurant
and you see a couple

711
00:31:56,184 --> 00:31:58,986
sitting there and both
of them are on the phone

712
00:31:58,986 --> 00:32:02,307
and not talking, you love
to nudge your partner

713
00:32:02,307 --> 00:32:04,307
and say, isn't that sad?

714
00:32:05,681 --> 00:32:07,414
That's terrible.

715
00:32:07,414 --> 00:32:08,413
Right?

716
00:32:08,413 --> 00:32:10,901
Oh look at this, that's terrible.

717
00:32:10,901 --> 00:32:12,790
I look at it very differently.

718
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,024
When I walk into a
restaurant and I see a couple

719
00:32:15,024 --> 00:32:17,033
sitting there and both
of them are on the phone

720
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:20,229
the whole 30 times, I get excited.

721
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,146
I feel better for them.

722
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:25,225
I'm happy for them.

723
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:26,586
Let me tell you why.

724
00:32:26,586 --> 00:32:27,586
I'm serious, my man.

725
00:32:27,586 --> 00:32:28,920
Let me tell you why.

726
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,337
It's very simple.

727
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:34,629
30 years ago that same couple
sitting at that restaurant,

728
00:32:34,629 --> 00:32:37,212
they didn't talk to each other.

729
00:32:38,084 --> 00:32:41,498
They sat across from each other,
all of you have seen this,

730
00:32:41,498 --> 00:32:43,415
all of you, I'm looking
around the crowd, you know,

731
00:32:43,415 --> 00:32:45,488
this is not 14 year
old girls in the crowd.

732
00:32:45,488 --> 00:32:46,600
We're a little older here.

733
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,764
How many people over 35?

734
00:32:47,764 --> 00:32:48,774
Raise your hand.

735
00:32:48,774 --> 00:32:49,775
Perfect.

736
00:32:49,775 --> 00:32:51,085
(audience laughing)

737
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:53,718
All of you have seen
what I saw 15 years ago

738
00:32:53,718 --> 00:32:55,812
which is you went to a
restaurant and you just happened

739
00:32:55,812 --> 00:32:57,898
to notice while you were
doing your thing, two people

740
00:32:57,898 --> 00:33:00,003
sitting there, a couple
not saying a fucking word

741
00:33:00,003 --> 00:33:01,254
to each other.

742
00:33:01,254 --> 00:33:02,087
Right?

743
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:07,119
My friends, technology has not changed us.

744
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:10,051
Technology has exposed us.

745
00:33:10,051 --> 00:33:11,604
The reason those two
people are sitting there

746
00:33:11,604 --> 00:33:15,771
and both on the phone is because
they don't like each other

747
00:33:17,701 --> 00:33:20,592
and when I see two people
sitting there in their 40's,

748
00:33:20,592 --> 00:33:23,829
50's, 60's, 70's and 80's
normally both on the phone

749
00:33:23,829 --> 00:33:28,037
and not talking to each
other, I see it as a mitzvah.

750
00:33:28,037 --> 00:33:30,963
I'm happy for them because
20 years ago they had nothing

751
00:33:30,963 --> 00:33:32,897
to do and they had to
get through that hour

752
00:33:32,897 --> 00:33:35,563
hating each other not
saying a fucking word

753
00:33:35,563 --> 00:33:38,032
but now they can look at their
YouTube video and be happy.

754
00:33:38,032 --> 00:33:40,185
(audience laughing)

755
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,798
(audience clapping)

756
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:42,631
It's true.

757
00:33:47,784 --> 00:33:49,289
Things are changing.

758
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:50,577
You have to understand your culture.

759
00:33:50,577 --> 00:33:53,436
I'm awfully aware of the
different nuances of the culture

760
00:33:53,436 --> 00:33:55,231
of the Nordics versus the U.S.

761
00:33:55,231 --> 00:33:58,822
When I speak everyone's, and
I'm type A for even America.

762
00:33:58,822 --> 00:34:00,294
People are like we're different here.

763
00:34:00,294 --> 00:34:01,296
We're subtle.

764
00:34:01,296 --> 00:34:02,603
I understand.

765
00:34:02,603 --> 00:34:04,959
I'm not asking you to do
anything uncomfortable.

766
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,835
I'm asking you to communicate
and not waste your money.

767
00:34:08,835 --> 00:34:10,417
It's not ground breaking.

768
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:11,880
It's not revolutionary.

769
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,844
It's a bad idea to waste
money and just because

770
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:18,015
your organization scores
it that way or your boss

771
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:20,812
believes in that doesn't mean it's right

772
00:34:20,812 --> 00:34:24,355
and so we are living through
a very big culture change.

773
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:26,246
The culture change is phenomenal.

774
00:34:26,246 --> 00:34:28,013
This is all time change.

775
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:31,504
15 years ago if you went
on the internet to go on

776
00:34:31,504 --> 00:34:35,960
a dating site and went on
a date, you were weird.

777
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,228
Now that is the norm.

778
00:34:38,228 --> 00:34:41,313
Can you imagine if I told
the parents in this room

779
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:44,086
20 years ago that I'm from the future

780
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:46,730
and let me tell you what's
gonna happen in 20 years,

781
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:50,027
you're gonna rather your
14 year old girl go into

782
00:34:50,027 --> 00:34:53,346
a stranger's car every
day to get around the town

783
00:34:53,347 --> 00:34:56,588
then to drive herself because
you would think that's safer.

784
00:34:56,588 --> 00:35:00,255
Nobody would've bought
me selling them Uber.

785
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:04,383
Nobody would've bought 20
years ago that kids would be

786
00:35:04,383 --> 00:35:06,415
going into strangers, you were taught,

787
00:35:06,415 --> 00:35:09,067
how many people over 35?

788
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:12,716
We were taught you don't
go into strangers' cars

789
00:35:12,716 --> 00:35:14,363
at all costs.

790
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:18,739
Now we're paying a fucking
premium to go inside of them.

791
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:20,907
The culture has changed.

792
00:35:20,907 --> 00:35:23,117
It's not changing, it's not coming.

793
00:35:23,117 --> 00:35:27,153
There are 60 year old men in
here who texted a poop emoji

794
00:35:27,153 --> 00:35:29,173
to their friend last night.

795
00:35:29,173 --> 00:35:31,740
(audience laughing)

796
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,863
The same 60 year old executive who said,

797
00:35:33,863 --> 00:35:37,077
what's an emoji 18 months ago.

798
00:35:37,077 --> 00:35:40,417
The same 60 year old
executive who 10 years ago

799
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:42,845
said they would never be on Facebook.

800
00:35:42,845 --> 00:35:46,307
The same 60 year old executive
for 15 years ago said to me,

801
00:35:46,307 --> 00:35:48,127
I'm not getting a cellphone.

802
00:35:48,127 --> 00:35:50,210
My pager works just fine.

803
00:35:52,397 --> 00:35:55,480
We, as a culture, do not like change.

804
00:35:57,091 --> 00:35:58,758
And in that we lose.

805
00:36:00,207 --> 00:36:03,732
It is time for you to go on
the offense, not the defense

806
00:36:03,732 --> 00:36:06,657
because I have a funny thing
to tell you about technology.

807
00:36:06,657 --> 00:36:10,539
Everything I believe in
didn't exist 15 years ago.

808
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:13,248
Not the smart phone, not
YouTube, not Facebook,

809
00:36:13,248 --> 00:36:14,748
not apps, nothing.

810
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:17,475
Did not exist.

811
00:36:19,084 --> 00:36:22,075
And if you think the last
15 years have been crazy,

812
00:36:22,075 --> 00:36:24,799
wait till you see what
technology is gonna do

813
00:36:24,799 --> 00:36:26,594
in the next 15 years.

814
00:36:26,594 --> 00:36:27,597
This is nothing.

815
00:36:27,597 --> 00:36:28,682
You know what this is?

816
00:36:28,682 --> 00:36:31,892
This iPhone X, you know what this is?

817
00:36:31,892 --> 00:36:33,843
This is a pager.

818
00:36:33,843 --> 00:36:35,176
This is a pager.

819
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:39,044
And in 10 years this is
gonna look so archaic,

820
00:36:39,044 --> 00:36:40,705
we're not gonna know what
to do with ourselves.

821
00:36:40,705 --> 00:36:43,512
So, let me ask you a question.

822
00:36:43,512 --> 00:36:46,551
How many people in this
room right now are retiring

823
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:48,517
in the next 10 years?

824
00:36:48,517 --> 00:36:52,225
And I don't mean you're gonna
crush it and sell your company

825
00:36:52,225 --> 00:36:55,327
for a billion dollars
and live on an island.

826
00:36:55,327 --> 00:36:58,291
I mean, you're old and you're finished.

827
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:00,479
(audience laughing)

828
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:02,950
Raise your hand, 10 years, show me.

829
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,533
Okay, great, great.

830
00:37:05,718 --> 00:37:07,468
So for the 13 of you,

831
00:37:09,257 --> 00:37:12,757
you can take this with somewhat importance

832
00:37:13,645 --> 00:37:16,986
but for the rest of you, my friends,

833
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:19,151
you have to understand
what we're living through.

834
00:37:19,151 --> 00:37:21,079
We're living through a race.

835
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,839
We're about to run a
marathon in technology.

836
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:26,283
Technology will eat up
every aspect of everything

837
00:37:26,283 --> 00:37:27,559
always and forever.

838
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:29,246
It's how it works.

839
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:31,027
The book stores were first.

840
00:37:31,027 --> 00:37:33,147
Then it was people that
owned taxi services.

841
00:37:33,147 --> 00:37:35,548
Then it was the hotel industry with Airbnb

842
00:37:35,548 --> 00:37:36,936
but it will keep going.

843
00:37:36,936 --> 00:37:38,850
The biggest TV networks in the world,

844
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,220
now that they're so TT, this
will keep going, everything.

845
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,452
Just because you have big contracts

846
00:37:43,452 --> 00:37:45,356
with the biggest companies in the world,

847
00:37:45,356 --> 00:37:48,757
what's that contract worth
when that company is not alive?

848
00:37:48,757 --> 00:37:51,548
This is real and so we're
about to run a marathon

849
00:37:51,548 --> 00:37:54,919
and the reason I stress
on you to be good at that

850
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:57,474
is not because I think
that's the end all, be all

851
00:37:57,474 --> 00:38:00,403
but you have no chance
to be good at AR and VR

852
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,335
and machine learning and crypto
currency and everything else

853
00:38:03,335 --> 00:38:06,384
that's coming next if you did
not ground yourself in this.

854
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:09,430
You can't run a 40 mile
marathon right now on the spot

855
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:12,618
if you haven't been on the
treadmill for the last six months

856
00:38:12,618 --> 00:38:14,916
and running little mini races to prepare

857
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:18,920
and if you are not adapting
this psychology first,

858
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,622
religion first, and then
becoming a practitioner,

859
00:38:21,622 --> 00:38:25,125
you need to be the architect,
the general contractor,

860
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:30,061
and the plumber because if
you don't, you will lose

861
00:38:30,061 --> 00:38:34,223
and so I implore you while
it's easy, it's fucking easy,

862
00:38:34,223 --> 00:38:35,837
to learn this.

863
00:38:35,837 --> 00:38:39,085
While it's easy you better
get serious about this

864
00:38:39,085 --> 00:38:42,689
because the next wave of
technology is gonna gobble you up

865
00:38:42,689 --> 00:38:46,856
and I implore you to take this
speech very, very seriously.

866
00:38:50,152 --> 00:38:51,154
Thank you.

867
00:38:51,154 --> 00:38:54,154
(audience clapping)

868
00:38:57,102 --> 00:38:58,464
Thank you.

869
00:38:58,464 --> 00:39:01,354
(audience clapping)

870
00:39:01,354 --> 00:39:03,271
- [Moderator] Gary Vee!

871
00:39:06,451 --> 00:39:08,497
I think, should I stand there or here?

872
00:39:08,497 --> 00:39:09,442
- You can do anything you want.

873
00:39:09,442 --> 00:39:10,840
- Can I come close to you?

874
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,306
- Yes, let's get real close.

875
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:13,139
- Okay.

876
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:13,972
Thank you, that was great

877
00:39:13,972 --> 00:39:15,906
and we all feel like dinosaurs now.

878
00:39:15,906 --> 00:39:18,598
How many feel like a dinosaur now?

879
00:39:18,598 --> 00:39:19,732
Yes, quite a few.

880
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,868
- Can I say something?

881
00:39:20,868 --> 00:39:21,837
That was actually, thank you.

882
00:39:21,837 --> 00:39:22,842
One more time, dinosaur.

883
00:39:22,842 --> 00:39:23,968
Who feels like a dinosaur?

884
00:39:23,968 --> 00:39:25,758
You know what's amazing about this game?

885
00:39:25,758 --> 00:39:28,800
Literally in 60 days you don't have to.

886
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,653
What I love about this
game is you could be

887
00:39:31,653 --> 00:39:33,869
a dinosaur of everything but good news,

888
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:35,702
that already happened.

889
00:39:37,314 --> 00:39:38,981
This is one of the most liberating things

890
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:40,180
I could tell somebody and by the way,

891
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,384
I'm not saying to make you feel good

892
00:39:41,384 --> 00:39:43,915
because I think you can
tell, I don't give a shit.

893
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:45,632
(audience laughing)

894
00:39:45,632 --> 00:39:47,123
I'm saying it because it's true.

895
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:49,626
The fact that you can go
from a zero, a dinosaur,

896
00:39:49,626 --> 00:39:51,474
I don't know what the
hell he's talking about

897
00:39:51,474 --> 00:39:52,780
or more importantly I understand

898
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,474
but I know nothing about
it, in 60 days and 40 hours,

899
00:39:56,474 --> 00:39:58,959
you can know everything.

900
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:00,478
That's incredible.

901
00:40:00,478 --> 00:40:02,098
Free information.

902
00:40:02,098 --> 00:40:03,230
Who's over 35?

903
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,791
Raise your hand real quick.

904
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:08,958
Tell these kids about
something called the library.

905
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,944
Like we used to go somewhere
to get information.

906
00:40:11,944 --> 00:40:12,947
What do you want to know?

907
00:40:12,947 --> 00:40:14,288
What do you want to know?

908
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:16,911
In our fingers, in a second.

909
00:40:16,911 --> 00:40:19,968
So, what excites me is, sure
you could feel like a dinosaur,

910
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:23,348
sure, it might feel intense
but I see it as optimism,

911
00:40:23,348 --> 00:40:24,502
not negativity.

912
00:40:24,502 --> 00:40:26,273
This is an opportunity for all of you

913
00:40:26,273 --> 00:40:29,103
and the biggest thing is,
you're gonna live much longer

914
00:40:29,103 --> 00:40:30,386
than you think.

915
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,313
There's a lot of people here
in their 40's, 50's, and 60's

916
00:40:32,313 --> 00:40:34,536
who think they're wrapping
up and finishing it

917
00:40:34,536 --> 00:40:37,585
and it was past where all
the opportunity for happiness

918
00:40:37,585 --> 00:40:40,852
professionally is the next
30 years between 50 and 80

919
00:40:40,852 --> 00:40:44,009
'cause you can start your own
business around your passion,

920
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:48,176
around ice hockey or beverages
or soup or suits or sneakers.

921
00:40:49,729 --> 00:40:53,782
This is so big that I just
think people are underestimating

922
00:40:53,782 --> 00:40:55,449
how great it can be.

923
00:40:56,827 --> 00:40:57,829
- Thank you.

924
00:40:57,829 --> 00:40:58,831
We feel much better.

925
00:40:58,831 --> 00:40:59,849
(man laughing)

926
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:01,530
(audience laughing)

927
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,693
I actually do.

928
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:03,526
That's good.

929
00:41:03,526 --> 00:41:05,060
Keep the questions coming in.

930
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,865
You heard Gary, this
is a free consultation

931
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:08,630
so just use the time.

932
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:11,316
And, I have a question here from Mark.

933
00:41:11,316 --> 00:41:15,310
What about ads on Facebook
for non-profit organizations?

934
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,313
Does it work?

935
00:41:16,313 --> 00:41:17,446
How should it be done?

936
00:41:17,446 --> 00:41:21,700
- I was among a well
member for an organization

937
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,321
called Charity Water that
I'd love for all of you

938
00:41:24,321 --> 00:41:26,615
to look at because it's
run by a club promoter

939
00:41:26,615 --> 00:41:29,455
and an entrepreneur which is
why it's being successful.

940
00:41:29,455 --> 00:41:30,456
Right?

941
00:41:30,456 --> 00:41:32,382
We're doing very well.

942
00:41:32,382 --> 00:41:34,248
We're really trying to bring fresh water

943
00:41:34,248 --> 00:41:35,284
to the entire world.

944
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:38,856
Scott Harrison is an all time
great non-profit executive.

945
00:41:38,856 --> 00:41:43,023
In the presentation on Sunday
night, which was remarkable,

946
00:41:43,977 --> 00:41:47,476
the biggest growth for the
company has been getting

947
00:41:47,476 --> 00:41:50,565
five dollar return on investment
for every dollar spent

948
00:41:50,565 --> 00:41:51,565
on Facebook.

949
00:41:53,536 --> 00:41:57,548
My friends, listen, it's
under priced attention.

950
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:02,006
It's six dollar CPM and
you can target 44 year old

951
00:42:02,006 --> 00:42:04,421
Korean women who like hockey.

952
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:05,494
I mean, it's crazy.

953
00:42:05,494 --> 00:42:06,785
Do you understand?

954
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:08,575
It's crazy what it can do.

955
00:42:08,575 --> 00:42:13,123
It's why it's changing our
macro, geopolitical climate.

956
00:42:13,123 --> 00:42:17,290
It's going to be 45 dollar
CPM in about three years.

957
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,191
That's it.

958
00:42:20,191 --> 00:42:22,339
It's just a lot better to
pay six dollars instead of 45

959
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:25,559
especially when you have to
spend hundreds of thousands

960
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:26,929
and millions.

961
00:42:26,929 --> 00:42:29,929
So yes, it can work for non profits.

962
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:32,511
- Another question.

963
00:42:32,511 --> 00:42:35,573
How do you think your
strategy regarding visibility

964
00:42:35,573 --> 00:42:37,865
and marketing on Instagram
and Snapchat would work if,

965
00:42:37,865 --> 00:42:41,365
this is hypothetical or not, I don't know,

966
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:45,313
I am CMO of Patek Phillip OMS.

967
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:48,099
Many people in marketing
would say that it's proven

968
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:51,296
that luxury brands lose
brand value and positioning

969
00:42:51,296 --> 00:42:53,164
if they're visible in the wrong context

970
00:42:53,164 --> 00:42:54,914
with the math brands.

971
00:42:57,382 --> 00:43:00,324
- I think there's a lot of things in there

972
00:43:00,324 --> 00:43:01,327
in that statement.

973
00:43:01,327 --> 00:43:05,244
I would say, number one,
ego is mixed in there.

974
00:43:06,394 --> 00:43:09,920
I would say naivety is mixed there.

975
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,330
Those two are the things that stand out.

976
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,540
I'm empathetic.

977
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:18,707
I'm empathetic to why Rolex
or Cartier or Aston Martin

978
00:43:20,187 --> 00:43:22,672
may think that this is below them.

979
00:43:22,672 --> 00:43:27,525
It's also why Tiffany's
and Aston Martin and Rolex

980
00:43:27,525 --> 00:43:30,283
will go out of business
over the next decade.

981
00:43:30,283 --> 00:43:31,821
Let me say it very clear one more time.

982
00:43:31,821 --> 00:43:35,339
Go out of business in the
next decade or 15 years

983
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:36,815
if they don't act.

984
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:38,827
They will because every day that goes,

985
00:43:38,827 --> 00:43:40,563
let me tell you something
about social media

986
00:43:40,563 --> 00:43:42,118
and luxury brands.

987
00:43:42,118 --> 00:43:45,053
None of them were there eight years ago.

988
00:43:45,053 --> 00:43:47,924
They're all there now,
they're just half pregnant

989
00:43:47,924 --> 00:43:51,439
because they're fucking
snobs run by snobs.

990
00:43:51,439 --> 00:43:54,442
(audience laughing)

991
00:43:54,442 --> 00:43:57,442
(audience clapping)

992
00:43:58,759 --> 00:44:01,091
And you know what's
amazing about meritocracy

993
00:44:01,091 --> 00:44:05,258
and capitalism and open
market dynamics, snobs die.

994
00:44:06,433 --> 00:44:09,357
- This is not a, just
personal opinion based on

995
00:44:09,357 --> 00:44:10,453
where you come from?

996
00:44:10,453 --> 00:44:11,595
No, yeah?

997
00:44:11,595 --> 00:44:15,155
- No I mean look, listen,
I don't think I can win

998
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:16,855
if I have personal opinions.

999
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:21,022
Christie's is selling $800,000
products on Instagram.

1000
00:44:22,132 --> 00:44:24,660
Is that a good enough answer?

1001
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,055
What do you want?

1002
00:44:26,055 --> 00:44:28,362
Like, do you not understand
how society works?

1003
00:44:28,362 --> 00:44:31,711
Do you not understand that
every rich person 35 to 45

1004
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:33,974
only lives on Instagram
and doesn't even know

1005
00:44:33,974 --> 00:44:35,891
what the fuck Vogue is?

1006
00:44:36,963 --> 00:44:39,141
Like, do you live in the world?

1007
00:44:39,141 --> 00:44:40,872
(audience laughing)

1008
00:44:40,872 --> 00:44:42,167
No, but I'm being real.

1009
00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:44,107
Listen, this is an opportunity like

1010
00:44:44,107 --> 00:44:48,331
are people that tone deaf or
is it that you're not doing it

1011
00:44:48,331 --> 00:44:51,489
because inside the companies
of these luxury brands

1012
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:54,158
they don't have an internal
MMM that knows how to score

1013
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:58,324
the metrics of the new modern
platforms so they over value

1014
00:44:58,324 --> 00:45:01,289
the impressions of print,
oh by the way for anybody

1015
00:45:01,289 --> 00:45:04,623
that's not in the business,
the way that print is valued

1016
00:45:04,623 --> 00:45:07,694
on how many people see it
is they give eight times

1017
00:45:07,694 --> 00:45:12,624
circulation value to how many
of the magazines are printed.

1018
00:45:12,624 --> 00:45:16,376
So if a high net worth
brand where you're in with

1019
00:45:16,376 --> 00:45:20,543
high net worth brands prints
500,000 or 100,000 copies,

1020
00:45:21,529 --> 00:45:25,696
they give you the fact that
800,000 people will see your ad

1021
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:30,620
on page 237 of that
magazine because you know

1022
00:45:32,322 --> 00:45:35,926
everybody takes the Robb
Report and Vogue and GQ

1023
00:45:35,926 --> 00:45:38,596
and leaves it on a plane and
then somebody else gets there,

1024
00:45:38,596 --> 00:45:43,104
picks it up and opens it and
carefully goes to page 237

1025
00:45:43,104 --> 00:45:44,854
and consumes your ad.

1026
00:45:46,135 --> 00:45:50,324
So listen, I think, to
answer your question,

1027
00:45:50,324 --> 00:45:52,271
my personal experience,
no, I think it's their

1028
00:45:52,271 --> 00:45:55,409
personal experience of how they
grew up or more importantly

1029
00:45:55,409 --> 00:45:58,545
how they wish it would be
because a lot of people

1030
00:45:58,545 --> 00:46:01,260
that work at brands like
that like the inclusive

1031
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,381
on a pedestal nature of that job.

1032
00:46:04,381 --> 00:46:05,894
Oh, and by the way, I don't blame you.

1033
00:46:05,894 --> 00:46:08,364
Enjoy it while it lasts.

1034
00:46:08,364 --> 00:46:10,673
(audience laughing)

1035
00:46:10,673 --> 00:46:13,673
(audience clapping)

1036
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:18,431
- Okay, we have a quite a
few questions that ask about

1037
00:46:18,431 --> 00:46:21,393
what is the, like after
Facebook when that becomes

1038
00:46:21,393 --> 00:46:24,100
too expensive, what's the next thing?

1039
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,561
- I don't know if you guys
know but I'm not Nostradamus.

1040
00:46:26,561 --> 00:46:28,599
(audience laughing)

1041
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:30,907
I have no idea and that's the beauty

1042
00:46:30,907 --> 00:46:34,093
of day trading attention and
trying not to have opinions.

1043
00:46:34,093 --> 00:46:35,320
I don't know.

1044
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,727
I don't know if AR will
be here fast enough

1045
00:46:37,727 --> 00:46:39,860
that there's something
that gets brought up.

1046
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:42,379
I don't know how soon we're
gonna wear contact lenses

1047
00:46:42,379 --> 00:46:45,169
and live in a virtual reality
world, not in the real world.

1048
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,252
I don't know.

1049
00:46:47,217 --> 00:46:50,394
What I know is that I have
a mental mindset, a religion

1050
00:46:50,394 --> 00:46:51,977
to know what it is.

1051
00:46:53,117 --> 00:46:57,266
I, in 1996 would stand up
here and tell you about email.

1052
00:46:57,266 --> 00:46:59,578
I, in 2001 would tell you about Google.

1053
00:46:59,578 --> 00:47:02,094
I, in 2004 would tell you
about programmatic banners

1054
00:47:02,094 --> 00:47:03,534
and YouTube.

1055
00:47:03,534 --> 00:47:06,221
I, in 2007 would tell you about Twitter.

1056
00:47:06,221 --> 00:47:08,243
Like, I don't know at all.

1057
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:11,352
I know that what got me
here isn't gonna get me

1058
00:47:11,352 --> 00:47:14,273
to the next place and
I know that the market,

1059
00:47:14,273 --> 00:47:17,429
much like luxury brands,
doesn't care about little old me

1060
00:47:17,429 --> 00:47:21,030
so when it's here in four years,
I'm gonna do a lot of work

1061
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:25,662
and stay up late and educate
myself and use my intuition

1062
00:47:25,662 --> 00:47:28,897
and my skill of consumer
behavior to figure out

1063
00:47:28,897 --> 00:47:32,898
how to story tell in the
place that has now emerged.

1064
00:47:32,898 --> 00:47:35,097
- [Moderator] Okay and so
then you have to go out

1065
00:47:35,097 --> 00:47:38,012
for the knowledge so your
intuition will work the right way.

1066
00:47:38,012 --> 00:47:40,768
Where do you sort of go?

1067
00:47:40,768 --> 00:47:42,774
- Everywhere where we are currently.

1068
00:47:42,774 --> 00:47:44,898
So I will tell you the pulse
of culture, no question,

1069
00:47:44,898 --> 00:47:46,943
lives on Instagram.

1070
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:49,447
You should spend an hour a
day just searching Instagram

1071
00:47:49,447 --> 00:47:51,869
hash tags and following a lot of people

1072
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,905
and then reading what people
leave, you should spend,

1073
00:47:53,905 --> 00:47:55,222
let me rephrase.

1074
00:47:55,222 --> 00:47:59,389
If you're a strategist, a
psychologist, somebody who,

1075
00:48:00,979 --> 00:48:04,109
anthropologist, if you're
curious about culture,

1076
00:48:04,109 --> 00:48:06,969
it is playing out in
your eyes on Instagram.

1077
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:10,299
It is the pulse, the heartbeats
of the emerging cultures.

1078
00:48:10,299 --> 00:48:13,240
I knew that eight year old
girls were gonna make slime

1079
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,407
two years ago.

1080
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:17,472
It's right there.

1081
00:48:17,472 --> 00:48:19,217
- Couldn't you have stopped it?

1082
00:48:19,217 --> 00:48:21,747
(audience laughing)

1083
00:48:21,747 --> 00:48:23,535
- I could have.

1084
00:48:23,535 --> 00:48:25,184
(audience clapping)

1085
00:48:25,184 --> 00:48:26,551
But that wouldn't have
allowed me to invest

1086
00:48:26,551 --> 00:48:29,114
a lot of money into the
Elmer's glue company.

1087
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,815
(audience laughing)

1088
00:48:30,815 --> 00:48:31,818
- [Moderator] You did?

1089
00:48:31,818 --> 00:48:32,821
- I sure did.

1090
00:48:32,821 --> 00:48:36,175
And, if I took my coin base out right now,

1091
00:48:36,175 --> 00:48:40,670
not that I'm a genius and I
surely didn't bet enough money

1092
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:44,550
but if I take my coin base
account out right now,

1093
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:48,358
I just want to be very accurate
so there's no confusion,

1094
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:52,541
by paying attention to culture
and betting on people's

1095
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:56,208
kind of actions I bought
on, let's see here,

1096
00:49:00,317 --> 00:49:03,900
on February 18, 2014,
I bought my bit coin.

1097
00:49:06,482 --> 00:49:07,649
Not last week.

1098
00:49:09,216 --> 00:49:12,336
What happens when you
stay curious and humble

1099
00:49:12,336 --> 00:49:15,015
is you start listening.

1100
00:49:15,015 --> 00:49:17,722
When you start listening
and executing it allows you

1101
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:20,589
to have the audacity to start talking.

1102
00:49:20,589 --> 00:49:23,185
That is a good strategy.

1103
00:49:23,185 --> 00:49:24,517
- [Moderator] Thank you.

1104
00:49:24,517 --> 00:49:25,519
- You're welcome.

1105
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:26,697
- Yes.

1106
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:28,119
This one.

1107
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:31,965
How important is personal brand compared

1108
00:49:31,965 --> 00:49:33,945
to the company brand as an entrepreneur?

1109
00:49:33,945 --> 00:49:36,134
- Look, I think everybody
has different levers.

1110
00:49:36,134 --> 00:49:38,947
If you're highly charismatic
and extremely handsome,

1111
00:49:38,947 --> 00:49:42,102
you should build a personal brand.

1112
00:49:42,102 --> 00:49:45,774
I think if you're an introvert
and you don't like people,

1113
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:46,790
you shouldn't.

1114
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:49,040
(audience laughing)

1115
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,504
(audience clapping)

1116
00:49:51,504 --> 00:49:52,337
It's true.

1117
00:49:53,391 --> 00:49:54,826
Look, it's very true.

1118
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:57,063
There are an amazing
amount of people building

1119
00:49:57,063 --> 00:49:59,690
incredible businesses,
organizations, governments,

1120
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:01,773
non profits, and businesses
that you'll never hear of.

1121
00:50:01,773 --> 00:50:03,855
They're more comfortable behind the scenes

1122
00:50:03,855 --> 00:50:05,238
and that's incredible.

1123
00:50:05,238 --> 00:50:07,669
Not everybody should be out
there doing, you have to,

1124
00:50:07,669 --> 00:50:10,002
self awareness is the magic.

1125
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:14,546
Knowing who you are is the magic.

1126
00:50:14,546 --> 00:50:18,012
Not being on stage and
making a joke, right?

1127
00:50:18,012 --> 00:50:21,764
So, I think it's incredible
if you're good at it

1128
00:50:21,764 --> 00:50:23,959
and you like it and you like people

1129
00:50:23,959 --> 00:50:25,526
and you can take the heat.

1130
00:50:25,526 --> 00:50:28,980
The key to a personal brand is humility.

1131
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:32,426
Like, when I put out content,
there's a lot of comments

1132
00:50:32,426 --> 00:50:36,069
that I'm a jackass or
I'm too cocky or I suck.

1133
00:50:36,069 --> 00:50:39,360
If you can't quantify
that, you won't produce

1134
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,130
so you have to know who
you are, if you're doing it

1135
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:44,164
for the right reasons, and
you have to deploy empathy

1136
00:50:44,164 --> 00:50:46,968
to why your personality
may not work for somebody

1137
00:50:46,968 --> 00:50:49,503
because everybody's got an
opinion and they're allowed

1138
00:50:49,503 --> 00:50:50,503
to share it.

1139
00:50:51,928 --> 00:50:55,965
- Do you see any danger in
the social media bubble?

1140
00:50:55,965 --> 00:50:58,829
Are we getting more stupid
by being fed with news

1141
00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:02,545
that confirm what we
already know or think?

1142
00:51:02,545 --> 00:51:04,573
- [Gary] No, I think we've
been historically stupid.

1143
00:51:04,573 --> 00:51:06,363
(laughing)

1144
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:07,611
- That's very true.

1145
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:09,451
- Here's a very simple question.

1146
00:51:09,451 --> 00:51:10,657
Life is binary.

1147
00:51:10,657 --> 00:51:12,534
When we have this conversation
about social media

1148
00:51:12,534 --> 00:51:14,635
manipulating us, life's binary.

1149
00:51:14,635 --> 00:51:16,121
I'm gonna ask you very simple.

1150
00:51:16,121 --> 00:51:19,656
Would you rather have the
society that we live in

1151
00:51:19,656 --> 00:51:22,378
be in a place where
they can consume content

1152
00:51:22,378 --> 00:51:26,339
from lots and lots of voices
or did you like 1973 better

1153
00:51:26,339 --> 00:51:29,783
when two or three or one old
white dude could tell you

1154
00:51:29,783 --> 00:51:30,616
what to think?

1155
00:51:30,616 --> 00:51:32,376
(audience laughing)

1156
00:51:32,376 --> 00:51:34,862
You can't have both.

1157
00:51:34,862 --> 00:51:35,864
I mean that.

1158
00:51:35,864 --> 00:51:38,274
Like, all of a sudden,
traditional media's been this

1159
00:51:38,274 --> 00:51:40,925
incredible golden era for all
the people that are scared

1160
00:51:40,925 --> 00:51:42,119
by the new regime.

1161
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:43,122
Really?

1162
00:51:43,122 --> 00:51:45,401
You liked when two people
controlled the media?

1163
00:51:45,401 --> 00:51:47,959
I'm thrilled all these men are being outed

1164
00:51:47,959 --> 00:51:49,939
for their transgressions.

1165
00:51:49,939 --> 00:51:51,698
That happens when the world's open,

1166
00:51:51,698 --> 00:51:53,412
not when they're friends with the people

1167
00:51:53,412 --> 00:51:55,062
that control the media.

1168
00:51:55,062 --> 00:51:56,062
Your choice.

1169
00:51:56,898 --> 00:51:59,101
- But I think most people
would agree that, yes,

1170
00:51:59,101 --> 00:52:01,450
it's better now in many
ways but still we have

1171
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:05,216
Mr. Putin and we have other
realities that really are

1172
00:52:05,216 --> 00:52:08,267
affecting democracy and what about that?

1173
00:52:08,267 --> 00:52:09,267
Are we supposed to--

1174
00:52:09,267 --> 00:52:11,077
- Dictators get to play too.

1175
00:52:11,077 --> 00:52:14,396
(audience laughing)

1176
00:52:14,396 --> 00:52:15,565
You know, yes.

1177
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:19,183
The naivety of the human
race that everything's

1178
00:52:19,183 --> 00:52:22,410
gonna stay the same, everything
is gonna ebb and flow

1179
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:25,747
and everything will always ebb and flow.

1180
00:52:25,747 --> 00:52:29,166
I just am an unbelievable buyer of us.

1181
00:52:29,166 --> 00:52:30,750
I'm an optimist of us.

1182
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,516
We've been around a long time.

1183
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:34,672
We have figured this out.

1184
00:52:34,672 --> 00:52:36,722
It always gets better.

1185
00:52:36,722 --> 00:52:37,939
You may not like it.

1186
00:52:37,939 --> 00:52:39,892
There might be something you don't like

1187
00:52:39,892 --> 00:52:41,969
but it always gets better.

1188
00:52:41,969 --> 00:52:44,759
You know what's scarier than social media?

1189
00:52:44,759 --> 00:52:46,270
The black plague.

1190
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:49,310
(audience laughing)

1191
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:50,471
I just believe in us.

1192
00:52:50,471 --> 00:52:51,868
Like, they'll always ebb and flow.

1193
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:54,290
I mean, Putin is executing
my thesis which is the media

1194
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:57,158
controls thinking and he
can use the tools as much

1195
00:52:57,158 --> 00:53:00,081
as anybody else but this
is where I get really mad

1196
00:53:00,081 --> 00:53:04,617
at human beings, we love
to blame somebody else.

1197
00:53:04,617 --> 00:53:08,102
Vladimir Putin did not come
to my house and make me

1198
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:09,769
read the propaganda.

1199
00:53:10,745 --> 00:53:11,745
You read it.

1200
00:53:12,621 --> 00:53:14,781
You're a big girl, you're a big boy,

1201
00:53:14,781 --> 00:53:17,003
stop pointing fingers.

1202
00:53:17,003 --> 00:53:20,023
Social and digital and the
new way communication works

1203
00:53:20,023 --> 00:53:21,273
is exposing us.

1204
00:53:22,886 --> 00:53:24,695
It's not changing us.

1205
00:53:24,695 --> 00:53:26,602
You know how the Facebook algorithm works?

1206
00:53:26,602 --> 00:53:29,793
If you keep clicking
and reading that stuff,

1207
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:32,086
it will show you more.

1208
00:53:32,086 --> 00:53:34,135
You want to try an incredible,
actually you know what,

1209
00:53:34,135 --> 00:53:35,406
I've never done this.

1210
00:53:35,406 --> 00:53:36,810
You want to try an incredible experiment?

1211
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:38,000
Go to Facebook.

1212
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,050
How many people use Facebook?

1213
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,052
Raise your hand.

1214
00:53:40,052 --> 00:53:41,055
Great.

1215
00:53:41,055 --> 00:53:43,930
Go to Facebook and search at
the top, which people don't do,

1216
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:47,430
search at the top a subject that you like.

1217
00:53:48,764 --> 00:53:50,198
Something you like.

1218
00:53:50,198 --> 00:53:53,698
Hockey, peanut butter and jelly, E sports,

1219
00:53:53,698 --> 00:53:54,943
whatever you want.

1220
00:53:54,943 --> 00:53:58,564
Shoes, suits, parenting,
something you like.

1221
00:53:58,564 --> 00:54:02,564
Search it then what shows
up like all the posts.

1222
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,246
Like 'em all.

1223
00:54:06,246 --> 00:54:07,402
Like them all.

1224
00:54:07,402 --> 00:54:08,914
(audience laughing)

1225
00:54:08,914 --> 00:54:10,331
And read three of them.

1226
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:13,548
Stay in the screen and read three of them

1227
00:54:13,548 --> 00:54:17,450
and then tell me what your
newsfeed does the next month.

1228
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:21,332
Tell me how much the bad
guys are manipulating you.

1229
00:54:21,332 --> 00:54:23,024
You're manipulating yourself.

1230
00:54:23,024 --> 00:54:25,183
You don't want to own up to it.

1231
00:54:25,183 --> 00:54:29,524
- But okay, let's have a real,
or might be a real example.

1232
00:54:29,524 --> 00:54:32,524
(audience clapping)

1233
00:54:34,478 --> 00:54:38,011
Trump says, we don't want any
immigrants in this country,

1234
00:54:38,011 --> 00:54:40,584
especially not the ones
from Belarus, okay?

1235
00:54:40,584 --> 00:54:41,788
- [Gary] Yeah.

1236
00:54:41,788 --> 00:54:45,538
- And every argument
for the immigrants being

1237
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:50,240
in the United States
won't reach peoples' feeds

1238
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,341
so this is the reality and
they want to throw you out

1239
00:54:53,341 --> 00:54:54,347
of the country.

1240
00:54:54,347 --> 00:54:57,905
How do you go about to sort
of to get into this space,

1241
00:54:57,905 --> 00:55:00,245
to reach these people?

1242
00:55:00,245 --> 00:55:02,127
- So there's a lot of questions in that.

1243
00:55:02,127 --> 00:55:05,814
First of all, Facebook
has a lot of attention

1244
00:55:05,814 --> 00:55:08,884
but it doesn't control all the air waves.

1245
00:55:08,884 --> 00:55:11,169
It doesn't control all the communication.

1246
00:55:11,169 --> 00:55:14,137
There's nobody who's
doing anything in a macro

1247
00:55:14,137 --> 00:55:16,836
that people aren't aware of.

1248
00:55:16,836 --> 00:55:19,504
It's not like people spend 100%
of their time in their feed.

1249
00:55:19,504 --> 00:55:22,570
Let me tell you something,
in America, if you only watch

1250
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:25,871
Fox News or if you only
watch CNN, you're seeing

1251
00:55:25,871 --> 00:55:27,339
two different things too.

1252
00:55:27,339 --> 00:55:29,146
There's no difference
of your Facebook feed

1253
00:55:29,146 --> 00:55:31,426
than if you have Fox News on the whole day

1254
00:55:31,426 --> 00:55:33,170
or CNN on the whole day.

1255
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:36,574
We are manipulating
our consumption always.

1256
00:55:36,574 --> 00:55:40,870
Also, in that scenario, I
know how to get to Americans

1257
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:44,647
to know about the Bela-Russian
thing just as well

1258
00:55:44,647 --> 00:55:48,289
as the Trump or the Hillary
Clinton or Obama machine

1259
00:55:48,289 --> 00:55:50,917
and believe it or not, on
Facebook, I have a fair chance.

1260
00:55:50,917 --> 00:55:52,750
In old media, I don't.

1261
00:55:54,906 --> 00:55:56,949
- Okay, let's argue about that later.

1262
00:55:56,949 --> 00:55:58,342
- That's nothing to argue about.

1263
00:55:58,342 --> 00:55:59,678
(woman laughing)

1264
00:55:59,678 --> 00:56:02,176
You will be historically wrong
if you believe what I just,

1265
00:56:02,176 --> 00:56:04,044
one more time.

1266
00:56:04,044 --> 00:56:06,796
Trump 40 years ago says
we're kicking everybody out.

1267
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:11,188
His two best friends are
Rupert and Les Moonves

1268
00:56:11,188 --> 00:56:15,711
and he controls the air waves,
you know, like dictatorships.

1269
00:56:15,711 --> 00:56:17,088
This is historical.

1270
00:56:17,088 --> 00:56:18,681
This is not my opinion.

1271
00:56:18,681 --> 00:56:20,348
Fidel Castro did it.

1272
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:23,092
This is simple.

1273
00:56:23,092 --> 00:56:26,282
Do you want two or three people
controlling the information

1274
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:28,725
or do you want an open marketplace?

1275
00:56:28,725 --> 00:56:30,842
There's nothing to argue about.

1276
00:56:30,842 --> 00:56:34,415
The conversation that we
need to have is our lack

1277
00:56:34,415 --> 00:56:38,093
of accountability of what we
consume and our curiosity.

1278
00:56:38,093 --> 00:56:41,592
The day after 9/11, I started
going to Al Jazeera's website

1279
00:56:41,592 --> 00:56:45,259
for the next year because
I wanted to learn.

1280
00:56:46,818 --> 00:56:49,341
That is way more important.

1281
00:56:49,341 --> 00:56:53,251
That is what we need to be as
a, we need to be empathetic

1282
00:56:53,251 --> 00:56:56,034
and we need to hear other points of view.

1283
00:56:56,034 --> 00:56:58,563
Whether you consume that on
Facebook or on television

1284
00:56:58,563 --> 00:57:02,011
or the newspaper or the
magazine, that's a human thing,

1285
00:57:02,011 --> 00:57:04,281
not a media distribution argument.

1286
00:57:04,281 --> 00:57:06,287
- Don't blame the
platform, okay, we get it.

1287
00:57:06,287 --> 00:57:07,120
- Do you agree?

1288
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,559
- I do agree, yes, I do.

1289
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:12,499
(audience laughing)

1290
00:57:12,499 --> 00:57:14,749
(laughing)

1291
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:22,102
Okay, someone wants to know
if you ever were wrong.

1292
00:57:23,351 --> 00:57:26,008
(audience laughing)

1293
00:57:26,008 --> 00:57:27,137
- A ton.

1294
00:57:27,137 --> 00:57:28,734
And let me tell you something
and this will make sense

1295
00:57:28,734 --> 00:57:31,868
and I think, Babin, this has
been the theme of our like

1296
00:57:31,868 --> 00:57:35,288
trip on this, I bought crypto in 2014.

1297
00:57:35,288 --> 00:57:37,669
Not the earliest, I had
friends buying it in 11 and 12

1298
00:57:37,669 --> 00:57:39,471
but definitely not the latest.

1299
00:57:39,471 --> 00:57:42,177
I have a lot of wins on my
board in early investing.

1300
00:57:42,177 --> 00:57:45,287
The reason somebody would ask
that question is I only talk

1301
00:57:45,287 --> 00:57:48,635
about things I know, not things I think.

1302
00:57:48,635 --> 00:57:50,199
I'm very basic.

1303
00:57:50,199 --> 00:57:52,763
I talk very little, very, I mean,

1304
00:57:52,763 --> 00:57:54,979
just in a very narrow place.

1305
00:57:54,979 --> 00:57:57,804
I could talk to you today
about AR and crypto currency

1306
00:57:57,804 --> 00:58:00,577
and the internet of things,
I just know there's a lot

1307
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:03,258
of people that are smarter
and better to talk about it

1308
00:58:03,258 --> 00:58:04,388
than me.

1309
00:58:04,388 --> 00:58:08,140
So the reason I feel like
cocky or are you ever wrong

1310
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:11,028
is I stay so God damn narrow
and I talk about things

1311
00:58:11,028 --> 00:58:12,961
that have already happened.

1312
00:58:12,961 --> 00:58:16,055
I'm not guessing up here my friends.

1313
00:58:16,055 --> 00:58:18,039
I'm just social commentating
on what happened

1314
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:19,206
and that's it.

1315
00:58:21,223 --> 00:58:24,056
And so, yeah, I'm wrong every day.

1316
00:58:25,213 --> 00:58:28,824
I just don't think it's a
good strategy to go on stage

1317
00:58:28,824 --> 00:58:31,829
(audience laughing)

1318
00:58:31,829 --> 00:58:33,829
and guess or opinionate.

1319
00:58:36,507 --> 00:58:37,509
- [Moderator] Thank you.

1320
00:58:37,509 --> 00:58:38,511
- [Gary] You're welcome.

1321
00:58:38,511 --> 00:58:41,511
(audience clapping)

1322
00:58:43,461 --> 00:58:44,493
- Okay, this one.

1323
00:58:44,493 --> 00:58:46,594
How do you use Facebook
in order to raise capital

1324
00:58:46,594 --> 00:58:47,713
for a start up?

1325
00:58:47,713 --> 00:58:51,880
- You run ads against employees
of venture capitalists.

1326
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,448
(audience laughing)

1327
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,967
- Is that a good answer,
whoever asked the question?

1328
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:00,820
- What's really interesting
about that is how great this is.

1329
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,815
The fact that I can make a
video on my phone for free,

1330
00:59:03,815 --> 00:59:06,594
articulate my points of
view of why my start up

1331
00:59:06,594 --> 00:59:10,271
and I as a founder are
special and then spend $600

1332
00:59:10,271 --> 00:59:13,938
reaching every single
employee of every single

1333
00:59:13,938 --> 00:59:16,486
venture capital firm that
could potentially want

1334
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:19,137
to talk to me is the greatest
opportunity in the history

1335
00:59:19,137 --> 00:59:22,238
of marketing and communications.

1336
00:59:22,238 --> 00:59:24,888
That's how you use
Facebook to get in front.

1337
00:59:24,888 --> 00:59:27,892
Now, if you're not a
practitioner and you just talk

1338
00:59:27,892 --> 00:59:30,524
about Facebook but you don't
know anything about it,

1339
00:59:30,524 --> 00:59:33,538
you might not know that one
of the ways you can run ads

1340
00:59:33,538 --> 00:59:35,820
on Facebook is clicking
a button that says,

1341
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:39,320
go to these company employees in the feed.

1342
00:59:41,121 --> 00:59:43,716
You may not know that.

1343
00:59:43,716 --> 00:59:45,217
That's it.

1344
00:59:45,217 --> 00:59:47,795
Headline readers, practitioners.

1345
00:59:47,795 --> 00:59:50,610
My plea here today is for
you to become a practitioner.

1346
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:54,120
If you're the CEO and 90
years old or 22 years old

1347
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,791
and you're gonna change the
world and everybody in between,

1348
00:59:56,791 --> 00:59:58,909
you have to be the practitioner.

1349
00:59:58,909 --> 01:00:00,475
This is oxygen now.

1350
01:00:00,475 --> 01:00:03,222
You can't have this as a nice to have.

1351
01:00:03,222 --> 01:00:06,642
Communication in today's
world is the value

1352
01:00:06,642 --> 01:00:09,142
and you have to be good at it.

1353
01:00:11,046 --> 01:00:13,985
- Gary, what's your best
tip on delivering quality

1354
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:14,818
at scale?

1355
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:21,446
- Driving down the cost of
the production of the content.

1356
01:00:21,446 --> 01:00:23,321
The biggest reason so
many people are losing

1357
01:00:23,321 --> 01:00:26,431
is 'cause they work with
agencies or internal people

1358
01:00:26,431 --> 01:00:31,163
that aren't producing enough
at an efficient enough price.

1359
01:00:31,163 --> 01:00:34,627
The reason, for the hands
that went up that follow me,

1360
01:00:34,627 --> 01:00:36,735
the reason I started
talking about documenting

1361
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:40,122
versus creating is because
I'm trying to produce

1362
01:00:40,122 --> 01:00:42,952
so much content, having
a man following me around

1363
01:00:42,952 --> 01:00:45,524
with a camera, though
narcissistic and crazy,

1364
01:00:45,524 --> 01:00:49,103
has allowed me to create so
much content because so much

1365
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:52,046
is happening all the time
and then I'm DJing it.

1366
01:00:52,046 --> 01:00:54,869
I think the biggest reason
people are struggling

1367
01:00:54,869 --> 01:00:59,036
is everything is too perfect,
too fancy and too subjective.

1368
01:01:00,347 --> 01:01:02,195
I let the market decide.

1369
01:01:02,195 --> 01:01:03,799
I deploy humility with my content.

1370
01:01:03,799 --> 01:01:05,247
I produce it, I put it out there,

1371
01:01:05,247 --> 01:01:06,500
and then I watch what happens.

1372
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,914
Not before.

1373
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:11,997
And so, this camera is so
much better of a camera

1374
01:01:13,397 --> 01:01:16,048
than what we had just six
years ago that costs thousands

1375
01:01:16,048 --> 01:01:17,352
of dollars.

1376
01:01:17,352 --> 01:01:19,301
You don't need unbelievable equipment.

1377
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:21,962
You need people who are native
to today's digital world

1378
01:01:21,962 --> 01:01:23,591
to produce content.

1379
01:01:23,591 --> 01:01:27,829
I would also say you have to
use content in multiple ways.

1380
01:01:27,829 --> 01:01:30,742
When I make a video, I
turn that into audio.

1381
01:01:30,742 --> 01:01:32,877
I turn that into the written word.

1382
01:01:32,877 --> 01:01:36,926
I get to write a 500 word
essay on LinkedIn off of

1383
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:39,646
maybe an answer that
I just gave here today

1384
01:01:39,646 --> 01:01:42,098
because it was recorded.

1385
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:43,477
Then it's transcribed.

1386
01:01:43,477 --> 01:01:46,703
Create a framework that
creates enough quality content

1387
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:50,944
at scale so you get a
thousand at bats instead of 13

1388
01:01:50,944 --> 01:01:55,249
which then allows you
to not debate quality.

1389
01:01:55,249 --> 01:01:57,749
Quality is subjective, period.

1390
01:02:00,445 --> 01:02:04,612
Until it hits the market and
there's too much audacity

1391
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:08,277
and ego in the executives in this room

1392
01:02:08,277 --> 01:02:10,527
and in my own company of what quality is

1393
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:13,549
before it goes out and I fight
that, I fight that daily.

1394
01:02:13,549 --> 01:02:14,551
- Okay.

1395
01:02:14,551 --> 01:02:17,612
But what homework can you
do earlier on in the process

1396
01:02:17,612 --> 01:02:20,825
to ensure that this
documenting or this produce

1397
01:02:20,825 --> 01:02:23,170
of content has a good quality?

1398
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:25,421
I mean, working with your values--

1399
01:02:25,421 --> 01:02:28,663
- I think the way you do it
you start and you put it out

1400
01:02:28,663 --> 01:02:31,478
and then you learn from the
feedback which then informs you

1401
01:02:31,478 --> 01:02:33,499
on the next thing that you do.

1402
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:34,749
It's iteration.

1403
01:02:35,882 --> 01:02:37,007
It's the reps.

1404
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:38,081
You gotta do it.

1405
01:02:38,081 --> 01:02:41,414
You can't read or debate about push ups.

1406
01:02:44,534 --> 01:02:46,464
If you want the ROI of push ups,

1407
01:02:46,464 --> 01:02:48,531
you've gotta do the fucking push ups

1408
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:50,431
and that's how I think about content.

1409
01:02:50,431 --> 01:02:51,761
I really do.

1410
01:02:51,761 --> 01:02:54,248
You can't read or debate
about the push ups

1411
01:02:54,248 --> 01:02:55,989
and I don't think you can read or debate,

1412
01:02:55,989 --> 01:02:58,448
now, I believe in strategy
and consumer insights.

1413
01:02:58,448 --> 01:02:59,916
I live on it.

1414
01:02:59,916 --> 01:03:02,394
You should do that but that has a moment

1415
01:03:02,394 --> 01:03:05,414
and then you need to produce and at scale

1416
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:07,530
because there's a lot of
platforms and a lot of attention

1417
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:10,101
and it's fragmented and you
gotta give yourself chances

1418
01:03:10,101 --> 01:03:14,831
and by putting out 800
videos, 30 of them are gonna

1419
01:03:14,831 --> 01:03:19,565
teach you so much for you to
be better at the next 800.

1420
01:03:19,565 --> 01:03:22,182
- So a major piece of
advice is just start?

1421
01:03:22,182 --> 01:03:23,015
- Yep.

1422
01:03:24,059 --> 01:03:26,339
(audience laughing)

1423
01:03:26,339 --> 01:03:27,339
- Okay.

1424
01:03:27,339 --> 01:03:29,383
- And that is very counter
cultural to organizations

1425
01:03:29,383 --> 01:03:30,916
and corporations.

1426
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:34,425
They're in the business of not starting.

1427
01:03:34,425 --> 01:03:38,164
- This is just a question
from me because I know

1428
01:03:38,164 --> 01:03:42,094
one can order you as a speaker
with or without cursing.

1429
01:03:42,094 --> 01:03:44,116
Is this with or without cursing?

1430
01:03:44,116 --> 01:03:45,889
(audience laughing)

1431
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:47,540
- I really hope this was with cursing.

1432
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:50,540
(audience laughing)

1433
01:03:51,888 --> 01:03:53,149
- [Moderator] You're in Sweden.

1434
01:03:53,149 --> 01:03:55,608
I don't think anyone minds anyway.

1435
01:03:55,608 --> 01:03:57,355
- Love you guys, take care.

1436
01:03:57,355 --> 01:03:59,489
If you can't curse in
Stockholm, you might as well

1437
01:03:59,489 --> 01:04:00,639
close up shop.

1438
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:01,831
You know?

1439
01:04:01,831 --> 01:04:03,493
Stockholm can handle it.

1440
01:04:03,493 --> 01:04:05,950
- What do you do when your
target audience is too small

1441
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:08,403
for Facebook or LinkedIn advertising tools

1442
01:04:08,403 --> 01:04:11,023
to let your ads through?

1443
01:04:11,023 --> 01:04:12,024
- Got it.

1444
01:04:12,024 --> 01:04:14,443
So the segmentation you're
creating is too small?

1445
01:04:14,443 --> 01:04:16,468
Who asked that question?

1446
01:04:16,468 --> 01:04:19,306
Ma'am, when you go for your targeting,

1447
01:04:19,306 --> 01:04:22,596
it shows a not a significant enough?

1448
01:04:22,596 --> 01:04:26,763
So I think for now, because
Facebook is so under priced,

1449
01:04:27,821 --> 01:04:31,619
when I try to do that, think
about a very interesting

1450
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:33,803
strategy that you might like.

1451
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:36,157
If you're going that small,
you're trying to reach

1452
01:04:36,157 --> 01:04:37,759
decision makers, right?

1453
01:04:37,759 --> 01:04:41,227
Think a lot about the
people that influence

1454
01:04:41,227 --> 01:04:42,810
the decision maker.

1455
01:04:44,127 --> 01:04:46,953
The reason I love employees of as a target

1456
01:04:46,953 --> 01:04:51,233
is because you never know which
employee has the CEO's ear.

1457
01:04:51,233 --> 01:04:53,823
It's funny to me and in my company of 800

1458
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:56,555
that there is 30, 40 people
that are very junior,

1459
01:04:56,555 --> 01:04:58,556
have a lot of influence over
me more than other people

1460
01:04:58,556 --> 01:05:00,638
that are very senior.

1461
01:05:00,638 --> 01:05:03,862
So, I think Facebook's so under
priced that you should just

1462
01:05:03,862 --> 01:05:08,029
add a wider range and give
away that money on the CPMs

1463
01:05:09,156 --> 01:05:11,694
because it's still worth
it to get to the group

1464
01:05:11,694 --> 01:05:13,128
that you're trying to reach.

1465
01:05:13,128 --> 01:05:15,623
So when I get too small,
I just make it wider

1466
01:05:15,623 --> 01:05:17,677
with age or preference or I'll tweak it.

1467
01:05:17,677 --> 01:05:20,879
Or by location because I know
that a lot of big companies

1468
01:05:20,879 --> 01:05:21,712
are there.

1469
01:05:21,712 --> 01:05:24,784
I widen it because I
still value it so much

1470
01:05:24,784 --> 01:05:28,097
that even wasting 80% of it
I still think is under priced

1471
01:05:28,097 --> 01:05:32,717
because the other option
is what's your alternative?

1472
01:05:32,717 --> 01:05:34,221
Right?

1473
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:36,875
Sending them a direct
mail or cold emailing them

1474
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:41,042
or sending them a message on
LinkedIn is not being heard.

1475
01:05:42,961 --> 01:05:44,211
Make sense-ish?

1476
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:47,997
Do we have a mic?

1477
01:05:47,997 --> 01:05:49,623
I want to have this conversation.

1478
01:05:49,623 --> 01:05:50,961
Do we have one?

1479
01:05:50,961 --> 01:05:52,070
- Where's the microphone?

1480
01:05:52,070 --> 01:05:53,307
- Oh right, Jesus Christ, that's insane.

1481
01:05:53,307 --> 01:05:55,209
You were right there, love it.

1482
01:05:55,209 --> 01:05:56,483
- Wow.

1483
01:05:56,483 --> 01:05:57,932
(audience laughing)

1484
01:05:57,932 --> 01:05:59,541
- [Woman] I guess it makes
sense but sometimes, you know,

1485
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:02,744
you have the people you
work for, they don't want

1486
01:06:02,744 --> 01:06:04,009
to spend a lot of money.

1487
01:06:04,009 --> 01:06:05,032
- No shit.

1488
01:06:05,032 --> 01:06:06,784
(audience laughing)

1489
01:06:06,784 --> 01:06:09,411
It doesn't make it wrong, right?

1490
01:06:09,411 --> 01:06:10,520
- [Woman] No, no.

1491
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:11,522
- Like, I get it.

1492
01:06:11,522 --> 01:06:12,696
Like I'm giving you the actual answer.

1493
01:06:12,696 --> 01:06:14,635
If you tell me I only get a $1,000 budget

1494
01:06:14,635 --> 01:06:17,197
because they don't believe in it

1495
01:06:17,197 --> 01:06:21,502
well that means you should
go find another job.

1496
01:06:21,502 --> 01:06:22,505
- [Woman] Okay.

1497
01:06:22,505 --> 01:06:23,505
- Good.

1498
01:06:23,505 --> 01:06:24,507
(audience laughing)

1499
01:06:24,507 --> 01:06:25,509
- [Woman] Thank you.

1500
01:06:25,509 --> 01:06:26,512
- You're welcome.

1501
01:06:26,512 --> 01:06:27,515
(audience laughing)

1502
01:06:27,515 --> 01:06:29,877
(audience clapping)

1503
01:06:29,877 --> 01:06:31,185
And I mean that, you
should find another job

1504
01:06:31,185 --> 01:06:34,555
if you unbelievably believe
that what we believe in

1505
01:06:34,555 --> 01:06:35,980
is right.

1506
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:38,567
If you don't, well then
you don't but, to me,

1507
01:06:38,567 --> 01:06:43,240
this is a real decade of
the haves and the have nots

1508
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:46,436
and you need to be smart
because the opportunity is great

1509
01:06:46,436 --> 01:06:47,901
if you actually understand.

1510
01:06:47,901 --> 01:06:51,633
The fact that you have targeted a segment

1511
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:56,324
that is not big enough means
that you're 99.7% ahead

1512
01:06:56,324 --> 01:06:58,845
of most of the marketers in the world.

1513
01:06:58,845 --> 01:07:01,301
You need to take advantage
of that, not just regress

1514
01:07:01,301 --> 01:07:02,718
into the machine.

1515
01:07:05,168 --> 01:07:08,391
- I wonder if her boss
is here or if he's here

1516
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:11,403
or she if that's good or bad.

1517
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:13,369
- I think it's good because I would hope

1518
01:07:13,369 --> 01:07:17,912
that she or he listens to
this conversation and says,

1519
01:07:17,912 --> 01:07:19,577
screw that guy on stage.

1520
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:22,573
Here's a couple of more
dollars, let's prove him wrong

1521
01:07:22,573 --> 01:07:24,970
and then I hope that
she makes good content

1522
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:27,634
so that we could prove him or her wrong.

1523
01:07:27,634 --> 01:07:30,773
- Okay, so these are good
arguments for getting

1524
01:07:30,773 --> 01:07:34,407
an organization going but
what else could you tell,

1525
01:07:34,407 --> 01:07:36,737
for example, Lars is 59 years old,

1526
01:07:36,737 --> 01:07:39,920
not very keen on spending
money on social media.

1527
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,816
- Listen, I don't have a huge
passion that 59 year old Lars

1528
01:07:44,816 --> 01:07:46,918
spends money on social media.

1529
01:07:46,918 --> 01:07:48,127
I really don't.

1530
01:07:48,127 --> 01:07:51,283
A, I don't give a fuck about Lars

1531
01:07:51,283 --> 01:07:55,502
but B, B, the market will
be the decision maker.

1532
01:07:55,502 --> 01:07:58,774
I don't want people to pander
to me or to the history.

1533
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:03,162
Like, I think Lars and Susan
should see what it's like

1534
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:07,351
for themselves but if
they don't, you know,

1535
01:08:07,351 --> 01:08:11,518
much bigger companies than
yours have gone out of business.

1536
01:08:12,727 --> 01:08:14,225
Why?

1537
01:08:14,225 --> 01:08:16,675
Because of this argument.

1538
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:17,676
Right?

1539
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:20,484
If my argument was wrong
then IBM would have never let

1540
01:08:20,484 --> 01:08:21,901
Microsoft happen.

1541
01:08:22,984 --> 01:08:26,415
Then Microsoft would've
never let Google happen.

1542
01:08:26,415 --> 01:08:28,694
Google would've never let Facebook happen.

1543
01:08:28,694 --> 01:08:33,574
Companies are built when
people don't see things.

1544
01:08:33,575 --> 01:08:37,180
Or, they see them but
they don't make change

1545
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:39,774
because the people in the
company don't actually care

1546
01:08:39,774 --> 01:08:41,382
about the health of the company.

1547
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:43,633
They care about themselves.

1548
01:08:44,474 --> 01:08:47,474
(audience clapping)

1549
01:08:49,085 --> 01:08:50,210
Super not fun,

1550
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:52,390
super not fun to make
the proper investment

1551
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:54,765
into Facebook right now
if the head of marketing

1552
01:08:54,765 --> 01:08:57,063
is bonused on efficiency on
a thing that doesn't score

1553
01:08:57,064 --> 01:08:58,814
Facebook advertising.

1554
01:09:03,259 --> 01:09:05,130
(audience laughing)

1555
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:07,136
- Okay, this is a personal question to you

1556
01:09:07,136 --> 01:09:08,630
from someone in the audience.

1557
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:11,312
Have you negotiated a deal
with Apple to give you

1558
01:09:11,312 --> 01:09:14,749
six dollars per view on
iPhone you would've made

1559
01:09:14,749 --> 01:09:16,749
at least $50,000 by now.

1560
01:09:18,513 --> 01:09:19,515
I haven't.

1561
01:09:19,515 --> 01:09:21,978
Apple isn't super in the
business of negotiating

1562
01:09:21,979 --> 01:09:23,198
directly with me.

1563
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:24,912
(audience laughing)

1564
01:09:24,912 --> 01:09:27,941
I haven't but what I would say is this.

1565
01:09:27,941 --> 01:09:32,108
I have zero expectations of
the other person or platform.

1566
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:37,354
I think one of the biggest
mistakes is people spend

1567
01:09:37,354 --> 01:09:38,971
a lot of time here saying,

1568
01:09:38,971 --> 01:09:41,859
well Facebook is benefiting
from me or this or that.

1569
01:09:41,859 --> 01:09:42,871
I don't care.

1570
01:09:42,872 --> 01:09:45,526
When I go into business, whether
it's a human or a platform,

1571
01:09:45,526 --> 01:09:48,720
I try to figure out what
I'm trying to get out of it.

1572
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,183
I always like if I'm getting
a little less out of it

1573
01:09:51,183 --> 01:09:54,234
because then I have leverage
and that's how I think about

1574
01:09:54,234 --> 01:09:56,229
the world and so I don't
think about what Google

1575
01:09:56,229 --> 01:09:58,317
and Apple and Facebook
are getting out of it.

1576
01:09:58,317 --> 01:10:00,453
I think about what I'm getting out of it

1577
01:10:00,453 --> 01:10:02,982
and if it's good enough for
me, then that's fine by me

1578
01:10:02,982 --> 01:10:05,135
and I think a lot of people
are misplaying their strategies

1579
01:10:05,135 --> 01:10:08,118
because of some theoretical
debate of who's getting

1580
01:10:08,118 --> 01:10:10,235
the better of the relationship.

1581
01:10:10,235 --> 01:10:12,351
I just try to spend time on
what I'm trying to get out

1582
01:10:12,351 --> 01:10:14,918
of the relationship and
if those two guys get 80%

1583
01:10:14,918 --> 01:10:17,438
of the value because they
get all my content for free

1584
01:10:17,438 --> 01:10:20,130
and it helps them and they
never buy a sneaker or a book

1585
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:21,301
or anything, I don't care.

1586
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:22,301
It makes me happy.

1587
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:23,134
Fine.

1588
01:10:23,134 --> 01:10:24,197
It's not why I'm doing
it and I think people get

1589
01:10:24,197 --> 01:10:27,624
really caught up in the wrong psychology.

1590
01:10:27,624 --> 01:10:28,457
- Good.

1591
01:10:29,607 --> 01:10:32,558
With an increasing CPM on
Facebook is the Facebook stock

1592
01:10:32,558 --> 01:10:34,252
the best investment today?

1593
01:10:34,252 --> 01:10:38,090
- Listen, I think actions
are better than words.

1594
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:40,478
I don't understand Wall
Street at all, period.

1595
01:10:40,478 --> 01:10:42,545
Let's start there.

1596
01:10:42,545 --> 01:10:43,945
I don't trust those fuckers.

1597
01:10:43,945 --> 01:10:45,787
(audience laughing)

1598
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:48,848
There's only two stocks that I buy ever.

1599
01:10:48,848 --> 01:10:50,083
Like ever.

1600
01:10:50,083 --> 01:10:51,750
Facebook and Amazon.

1601
01:10:52,993 --> 01:10:53,994
Period.

1602
01:10:53,994 --> 01:10:56,047
That is the only stocks that I've bought

1603
01:10:56,047 --> 01:10:59,829
in the last five years
because of Mark and Jeff.

1604
01:10:59,829 --> 01:11:02,178
I believe companies are
complete replications

1605
01:11:02,178 --> 01:11:04,893
of the leadership and I
think both of those guys

1606
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:07,746
are playing long term not
to make the stock good

1607
01:11:07,746 --> 01:11:11,300
in the next 90 days and
that's how you actually win

1608
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,019
in business.

1609
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:16,679
You invest in the next things and so, yes,

1610
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:19,679
I think Facebook is grossly
under priced at $175.

1611
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:23,846
Now, could macro economics
crash the world economy

1612
01:11:24,766 --> 01:11:27,129
and that 175 go to 85?

1613
01:11:27,129 --> 01:11:30,497
Of course but if you put,
well, if you put $175

1614
01:11:30,497 --> 01:11:34,649
into Facebook and you never
need that money, ever,

1615
01:11:34,649 --> 01:11:37,987
I am convinced blindly
that you will return

1616
01:11:37,987 --> 01:11:40,889
and investment on that in a 10 year macro

1617
01:11:40,889 --> 01:11:44,084
and that's how I think
about Amazon and Facebook.

1618
01:11:44,084 --> 01:11:48,798
- It's been really great
getting to know you today

1619
01:11:48,798 --> 01:11:52,371
and also yesterday in
Gothenburg but what will you do

1620
01:11:52,371 --> 01:11:54,475
in the next 15 years?

1621
01:11:54,475 --> 01:11:59,338
Do you have a plan or is it
just or what's your objectives?

1622
01:11:59,338 --> 01:12:01,361
- I don't know if you heard earlier

1623
01:12:01,361 --> 01:12:02,664
about the Nostradamus thing.

1624
01:12:02,664 --> 01:12:04,298
(woman laughing)

1625
01:12:04,298 --> 01:12:06,352
My intuition is, over
the last year or two,

1626
01:12:06,352 --> 01:12:10,398
I've become intoxicated
with impacting young men.

1627
01:12:10,398 --> 01:12:12,444
I have a lot of young guys following me

1628
01:12:12,444 --> 01:12:14,240
because of the alpha nature.

1629
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,241
You can see, this is
probably the most alpha I am

1630
01:12:16,241 --> 01:12:19,134
because when I'm on stage
and nobody can talk back,

1631
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:20,175
I like that.

1632
01:12:20,175 --> 01:12:21,176
Right?

1633
01:12:21,176 --> 01:12:22,207
(audience laughing)

1634
01:12:22,207 --> 01:12:23,332
And it allows me to be
a little more bravado

1635
01:12:23,332 --> 01:12:24,899
and I'm a little bit more of a showman.

1636
01:12:24,899 --> 01:12:26,769
When I'm one on one in
real life it comes down

1637
01:12:26,769 --> 01:12:29,803
in a different direction
but through my personality

1638
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:32,129
I've gotten the attention
of a lot of young men

1639
01:12:32,129 --> 01:12:37,016
and I'm really trying to
teach gratitude and empathy

1640
01:12:37,016 --> 01:12:38,472
and kindness.

1641
01:12:38,472 --> 01:12:41,692
I think these are weapons
to why I've been successful

1642
01:12:41,692 --> 01:12:44,412
and I do have an ambition
over the next 15 years

1643
01:12:44,412 --> 01:12:47,995
to become unbelievably
popular to that demo

1644
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:51,278
so that I can make them
a different version

1645
01:12:51,278 --> 01:12:54,561
than what they used to look
up to, Rolexes and Porsches

1646
01:12:54,561 --> 01:12:58,144
and parties and I do
have some pretty lofty

1647
01:13:00,524 --> 01:13:05,090
historical legacy ambitions
on my ability to communicate

1648
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:07,455
and the way that my mother raised me.

1649
01:13:07,455 --> 01:13:10,123
My intuition is that
every day that goes by

1650
01:13:10,123 --> 01:13:12,956
that continues to pull at me more.

1651
01:13:15,037 --> 01:13:18,370
Yeah, I want to be historically correct.

1652
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:24,121
- And that really comes
through when you spend time

1653
01:13:24,121 --> 01:13:28,288
with you and I was just wondering,
what did your mother do?

1654
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:31,560
- She taught me, boy, she's fucking,

1655
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:32,997
she did everything right.

1656
01:13:32,997 --> 01:13:34,567
So what did she do?

1657
01:13:34,567 --> 01:13:37,995
She over accentuated
when I did good things.

1658
01:13:37,995 --> 01:13:41,418
Meaning, I remember
clearly opening the door

1659
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:44,022
for an elderly woman
when I was seven or eight

1660
01:13:44,022 --> 01:13:45,189
at McDonald's.

1661
01:13:46,418 --> 01:13:48,592
You know, we're just going.

1662
01:13:48,592 --> 01:13:49,774
I just remember this clearly.

1663
01:13:49,774 --> 01:13:51,696
I opened the door for this elderly woman.

1664
01:13:51,696 --> 01:13:54,113
My mom acted, at that moment,

1665
01:13:55,654 --> 01:13:58,404
like I won the Nobel Peace Prize.

1666
01:14:00,290 --> 01:14:02,658
So she was very aggressive
when I was being kind

1667
01:14:02,658 --> 01:14:05,236
or deploying empathy.

1668
01:14:05,236 --> 01:14:07,519
But she also didn't let
me get away with things.

1669
01:14:07,519 --> 01:14:10,471
So, she knew I was gonna
be successful long before

1670
01:14:10,471 --> 01:14:12,986
anybody else but when
I would get D's and F's

1671
01:14:12,986 --> 01:14:16,846
on my report card she would
punish me for a week or two

1672
01:14:16,846 --> 01:14:21,467
even though she knew it
meant nothing but she wanted

1673
01:14:21,467 --> 01:14:24,534
to teach me that things had repercussions.

1674
01:14:24,534 --> 01:14:27,926
She was my biggest cheerleader
but she was practical

1675
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:31,843
and I'm so grateful for
her and so she built up

1676
01:14:33,787 --> 01:14:37,788
my self esteem to an
uncomfortably high level.

1677
01:14:37,788 --> 01:14:39,992
(audience laughing)

1678
01:14:39,992 --> 01:14:43,041
And she raised three children with no help

1679
01:14:43,041 --> 01:14:44,672
and worked her ass off.

1680
01:14:44,672 --> 01:14:46,701
Like, I can't even, she
did some things wrong

1681
01:14:46,701 --> 01:14:48,739
but it came out of what
she did amazingly well.

1682
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:52,209
Like, I can't do anything for
myself like peel an orange

1683
01:14:52,209 --> 01:14:55,496
or wash clothes because my
mom did everything for me.

1684
01:14:55,496 --> 01:14:57,471
She was that hard core.

1685
01:14:57,471 --> 01:15:00,202
She created an incredible framework for me

1686
01:15:00,202 --> 01:15:02,991
and to be very honest with
you, so much of what I do

1687
01:15:02,991 --> 01:15:07,792
is out of guilt and
gratitude for how my parents

1688
01:15:07,792 --> 01:15:11,560
raised me and me not having
anything and having to work

1689
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:14,159
for it that I'm trying to,
I feel like a lot of this

1690
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:15,964
is me giving,

1691
01:15:15,964 --> 01:15:18,399
as lucrative as this is
for me to get paid for,

1692
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:20,857
and I'm sure you guys and
the organizers for my fee,

1693
01:15:20,857 --> 01:15:24,391
but I'm very fortunate,
the companies I'm building,

1694
01:15:24,391 --> 01:15:27,209
my time allocation is
far greater for me to be

1695
01:15:27,209 --> 01:15:31,606
in the business than to
be here for a day but this

1696
01:15:31,606 --> 01:15:34,029
and knowing I was gifted
with a communication style

1697
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,978
that is actually gonna
get three people here

1698
01:15:35,978 --> 01:15:39,738
to do something, that has
a lot to do with the way

1699
01:15:39,738 --> 01:15:40,912
I was parented.

1700
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:44,171
I'm desperate to give back
the wisdom and the framework

1701
01:15:44,171 --> 01:15:47,205
that Sasha and Tamara gave to me.

1702
01:15:47,205 --> 01:15:50,205
(audience clapping)

1703
01:15:53,547 --> 01:15:54,911
- Thank you Gary, that's beautiful.

1704
01:15:54,911 --> 01:15:55,911
- [Gary] Thank you.

1705
01:15:55,911 --> 01:15:59,032
- And one last question was
from someone in the audience.

1706
01:15:59,032 --> 01:16:00,977
Can I get my selfie taken
with you and maybe they can

1707
01:16:00,977 --> 01:16:02,119
by the book table?

1708
01:16:02,119 --> 01:16:03,120
- 100%, let's go.

1709
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,504
Oh at the book, oh that's a segue.

1710
01:16:04,504 --> 01:16:05,685
I wanted to do it here.

1711
01:16:05,685 --> 01:16:07,061
Sorry, don't want to break the system.

1712
01:16:07,061 --> 01:16:08,301
Yes, I will be at the book table.

1715
01:16:10,514 --> 01:16:11,659
- Do we want that one
person to come up here now?

1716
01:16:11,659 --> 01:16:13,414
- Yeah, who wrote that?

1717
01:16:13,414 --> 01:16:14,726

1718
01:16:14,726 --> 01:16:15,757

It's fucking selfie time.

Pleasure.

You ready?

Two things, what did you
think of the key note

1740
01:16:48,133 --> 01:16:50,362
and number two, what's your
take on the Stockholm syndrome?

1741
