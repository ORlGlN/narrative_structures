1
00:00:01,175 --> 00:00:03,925
- [DROCK] Wait, where's my phone.

2
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:08,489
Oh yeah, I left in Gary's office.

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:12,566
By the way, this is why
I love Instagram DM.

4
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:14,598
I saw a video that a fan had made,

5
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,636
and I reached out to them on DM,

6
00:00:16,636 --> 00:00:20,119
shot them a message, and they
were like, yeah cool, use it.

7
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:22,638
And so, yo Andy, you
ready to do your part?

8
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:23,719
- Yeah, let's do it man.

9
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:25,684
What's up Vayner Nation, it's Andy,

10
00:00:25,684 --> 00:00:27,422
brand director for Gary Vaynerchuk.

11
00:00:27,422 --> 00:00:28,469
Did you watch it?

12
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:29,758
- Yeah I'm watching it right now, but.

13
00:00:29,758 --> 00:00:31,117
- [DROCK] What do you think so far?

14
00:00:31,117 --> 00:00:31,950
- It's really good.

15
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,941
I love the fact that he
was talking about offense,

16
00:00:33,941 --> 00:00:37,316
'cause that mindset is
the mindset of the year.

17
00:00:37,316 --> 00:00:39,115
- So we're trying to come
up with the best versions

18
00:00:39,115 --> 00:00:41,216
of DailyVee to post with Gary being

19
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,990
off the grid during the holidays.

20
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,375
We found this motivational video
from the Mulligan Brothers,

21
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:46,599
it has a million views.

22
00:00:46,599 --> 00:00:48,418
When DROCK texted Gary he said,

23
00:00:48,418 --> 00:00:49,760
I'm not going to intro it, why don't you,

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,366
DROCK and Iris do it?

25
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:52,425
So that's what we're doing.

26
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:53,898
My meta take on it was that

27
00:00:53,898 --> 00:00:56,524
Gary's talking about perspective
and offense and everything

28
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,671
and that's exactly what these guys did.

29
00:00:58,671 --> 00:01:00,453
Like, they just didn't have content,

30
00:01:00,453 --> 00:01:02,220
so they went out and found it online,

31
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,360
cut it up and got a
million views out of it.

32
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,612
There's so much opportunity if your head

33
00:01:06,612 --> 00:01:08,118
is in the right space to go and take it.

34
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:10,101
- I love the key points of everything,

35
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:12,574
and then adding on top of the music,

36
00:01:12,574 --> 00:01:16,456
it's good, and then it
has good b-roll in it so,

37
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:18,066
excited for you all to see it.

38
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:19,743
- And it just comes down to perspective,

39
00:01:19,743 --> 00:01:23,064
and if this video doesn't
give you that perspective,

40
00:01:23,064 --> 00:01:24,246
you're shit out of luck.

41
00:01:24,246 --> 00:01:26,829
(upbeat music)

42
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,887
- I think so many people are
keyboard activists, right?

43
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:37,217
Everybody's good at sending a tweet about

44
00:01:37,217 --> 00:01:38,547
how the world should be,

45
00:01:38,547 --> 00:01:40,065
and nobody's doing anything about it,

46
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:42,545
and that is just, very much, human nature.

47
00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:45,145
(slow dramatic music)

48
00:01:45,145 --> 00:01:46,866
- [DROCK] We've gotten soft, as a culture.

49
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:51,759
- Yes, of course we've gotten
soft as a culture in the U.S.

50
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,961
Because the U.S. has had
an incredible 200 year run.

51
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:57,561
This is just what happens.

52
00:01:57,561 --> 00:02:00,978
So as a culture, I can't speak for people

53
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:03,571
that live in the Amazon River

54
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:06,777
and I can't speak for people
that still live in Belarus

55
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:09,444
but the American culture is soft

56
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:12,338
and that's a great thing.

57
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:15,362
That means there's been
enormous amounts of prosperity.

58
00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:16,805
But let's not be naive.

59
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:19,287
People, literally, complain when somebody

60
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:22,703
gives then the wrong amount of extra cream

61
00:02:22,703 --> 00:02:24,916
in a Starbucks $6 coffee.

62
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:28,083
(slow dramatic music)

63
00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:40,478
My lack of interest in
complaining is so high

64
00:02:40,478 --> 00:02:42,733
and when I watch what
people complain about,

65
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:46,031
it breaks my heart because they
completely lack perspective.

66
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:47,751
I generally believe my happiness

67
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,876
and optimism comes from my perspective.

68
00:02:49,876 --> 00:02:52,745
I even, in political unrest
times, like right now.

69
00:02:52,745 --> 00:02:54,384
A lot of people are
very bent out of shape.

70
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:57,788
But the reality is that
it's just never been better

71
00:02:57,788 --> 00:02:59,086
to be a human being.

72
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:00,120
That's just the truth.

73
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,326
That's just data. That's reality.

74
00:03:02,326 --> 00:03:05,826
And it's just a very fun time to be alive.

75
00:03:14,253 --> 00:03:17,325
I think the way people look
at the world right now,

76
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:19,266
because it's such an incredible time,

77
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,489
is actually the quickest
tell to who they are.

78
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:24,091
If you think it sucks,

79
00:03:24,091 --> 00:03:27,715
or that it's bad, you are
loosing pessimistic DNA.

80
00:03:27,715 --> 00:03:30,377
And if you think it's
awesome and phenomenal,

81
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,987
you have optimistic, winning DNA

82
00:03:31,987 --> 00:03:33,346
and I believe that to be true.

83
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,763
And so that's where we're at.

84
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:40,139
We're beating ourselves up.

85
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:43,641
Like everybody sucks at something, right?

86
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:45,614
We all have shortcomings

87
00:03:45,614 --> 00:03:46,852
ans we all have strengths.

88
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,763
And for me, it's like, why
don't we just audit that?

89
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,414
Why don't we just look at it that way?

90
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:52,635
And be like, alright, I'm good at this

91
00:03:52,635 --> 00:03:54,627
but I'm not good at that.

92
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:57,765
And then I only focus
what I'm good at right?

93
00:03:57,765 --> 00:04:00,560
I don't dwell that I can't
fix shit around the house.

94
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,251
I call somebody to fix it.

95
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:03,270
I'm not like I'm not a man.

96
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,937
I don't give a fuck.

97
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:07,723
I don't get it.

98
00:04:07,723 --> 00:04:09,937
I also think it's awesome that I'm so

99
00:04:09,937 --> 00:04:11,317
emotionally stable and I'm

100
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,356
the emotional backbone of everybody.

101
00:04:13,356 --> 00:04:14,479
Is that what a dude's supposed to do?

102
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,646
These cliches, these
stereotypes, they're so silly.

103
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:22,912
I'm fully in love with myself.

104
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:26,502
But I'm also fully in love
with everybody else too.

105
00:04:26,502 --> 00:04:27,703
It goes both ways.

106
00:04:27,703 --> 00:04:30,687
I tell people to buy into
me, that work for me.

107
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,299
It's 'cause I buy into them first.

108
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:37,896
I don't need anybody
to gain trust with me.

109
00:04:37,896 --> 00:04:39,011
It's there.

110
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:43,178
I believe the human race
is so grossly under rated.

111
00:04:44,473 --> 00:04:46,093
We are good.

112
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:47,406
Of course we have some bad.

113
00:04:47,406 --> 00:04:49,832
There's fucking seven billion of us.

114
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:52,792
But when you look at our
net score, it's bonker shit.

115
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,860
Do you know how much damage we could

116
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,698
be doing to each other on an
hourly basis and we don't?

117
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:00,195
We're still here. We won.

118
00:05:00,195 --> 00:05:02,824
We're the alpha being
and we've figured out

119
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:04,248
how to stay together.

120
00:05:04,248 --> 00:05:06,871
This is insane when you think about it.

121
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:08,201
And yet everybody wants to dwell

122
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:10,715
on like somebody said something mean.

123
00:05:10,715 --> 00:05:13,882
(slow dramatic music)

124
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:16,161
If you want to be an anomaly,

125
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:17,678
you have to act like one.

126
00:05:17,678 --> 00:05:19,237
People want all these special things

127
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:21,863
to happen but then they're
acting like everybody else.

128
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,502
And that gets into the
Saturdays on, in your 20's.

129
00:05:25,502 --> 00:05:27,375
Or just like taking risks

130
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,266
or things of that nature.

131
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:31,427
If there's anything they take away,

132
00:05:31,427 --> 00:05:34,211
it's like look, you're
gonna only be so pretty,

133
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:37,227
you're only gonna be so smart.

134
00:05:37,227 --> 00:05:38,248
There's things that are gonna be natural

135
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:41,066
and then there's things that
you can actually control.

136
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:42,441
I do believe and I don't know

137
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:44,174
if I'm right or wrong, I don't.

138
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:48,227
But I do believe that work
ethic is a taught behavior.

139
00:05:48,227 --> 00:05:52,394
It's something that you
do have more control over.

140
00:05:54,173 --> 00:05:56,340
You know what really
sealed the deal for me?

141
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,168
Getting healthier.

142
00:05:58,168 --> 00:06:02,140
I was 38 years old and it
didn't come natural to me.

143
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,589
It didn't come natural to me at all.

144
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:06,065
I hate the gym. I hate it now.

145
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,346
I hate it. I don't like it.

146
00:06:07,346 --> 00:06:09,179
I don't want to do it.

147
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,582
But I knew it was important

148
00:06:11,582 --> 00:06:14,200
and somewhere around midway
through being 38 years old,

149
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,171
I got serious, I figured out my system.

150
00:06:16,171 --> 00:06:17,603
I made the financial commitment.

151
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:19,186
And I've won right?

152
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,736
And I'll never loose again because

153
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:23,944
the system was I needed to be accountable

154
00:06:23,944 --> 00:06:25,419
to another human being.

155
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,442
So it was about Mike and now Jordan,

156
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:28,745
whoever else is my trainer.

157
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:30,720
I'm doing it, almost weirdly more,

158
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,343
to not let them down.

159
00:06:32,343 --> 00:06:35,413
(slow dramatic music)

160
00:06:35,413 --> 00:06:36,713
I feel like there's a shift

161
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:38,718
that can make people work harder.

162
00:06:38,718 --> 00:06:42,385
The big one that I push
is you're gonna die.

163
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:45,907
To me, life is broken down
into complaining and not.

164
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:47,886
So if you're not complaining,

165
00:06:47,886 --> 00:06:49,885
well then I have no advise for you.

166
00:06:49,885 --> 00:06:51,802
I'm pumped. You did it.

167
00:06:52,727 --> 00:06:56,806
I have friends who make $42,000 a year,

168
00:06:56,806 --> 00:06:59,415
work nine to four, kind of,

169
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:00,829
with an hour and a half lunch

170
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:03,282
and 45 minutes of YouTube and 10 minutes

171
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:05,935
of bullshitting and an hour of complete

172
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:06,811
wasted time in a meeting.

173
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:10,311
So they're working six hours a week right?

174
00:07:11,942 --> 00:07:13,303
But they're pumped.

175
00:07:13,303 --> 00:07:14,865
And they text me.

176
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:15,904
These are high school friends.

177
00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:17,846
And they'll text me how happy they are

178
00:07:17,846 --> 00:07:21,605
to be the coach of their
kid's baseball team.

179
00:07:21,605 --> 00:07:22,646
That's amazing.

180
00:07:22,646 --> 00:07:24,703
In fact, that seems very obvious to me.

181
00:07:24,703 --> 00:07:25,786
That's right.

182
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,604
You know what's super weird?

183
00:07:28,604 --> 00:07:31,645
I'm actually weirdly envious.

184
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:33,815
It sounds cool, in theory.

185
00:07:33,815 --> 00:07:34,897
The grass is always greener right?

186
00:07:34,897 --> 00:07:36,397
Far less pressure.

187
00:07:38,011 --> 00:07:40,450
All that time with my
kids, that would be cool.

188
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,549
There's just all these
things that I can justify.

189
00:07:43,549 --> 00:07:44,976
But I have friends who
have 100 million dollars

190
00:07:44,976 --> 00:07:47,954
in the bank because of Facebook's IPO

191
00:07:47,954 --> 00:07:50,147
who complain, who are still hungry,

192
00:07:50,147 --> 00:07:51,426
who want to do even more,

193
00:07:51,426 --> 00:07:52,946
who will complain to me 'cause they know

194
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:55,568
I work a lot about no work life balance

195
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:56,496
and they don't get to spend enough

196
00:07:56,496 --> 00:07:57,400
time with they're family.

197
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,666
And I'm like, you have a
hundred million dollars.

198
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,311
You could stay home.

199
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:04,377
You're in control.

200
00:08:04,377 --> 00:08:05,887
Don't complain about it.

201
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,892
You've made that choice.

202
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:08,447
Don't bullshit me.

203
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,966
You want to spend more
time with your family?

204
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:12,716
Spend more time with your family.

205
00:08:14,308 --> 00:08:15,462
I'm trying to be very careful about

206
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,593
what I'm saying versus what I'm doing.

207
00:08:17,593 --> 00:08:18,945
Because that's how you get exposed.

208
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:20,674
I don't mean people calling you out

209
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:21,842
and being like, you suck.

210
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:23,583
I mean to yourself.

211
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,584
I don't want to be exposed by myself.

212
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:27,598
It's looking yourself in the mirror

213
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:29,177
and saying, "Am I doing this right?"

214
00:08:29,177 --> 00:08:31,746
So, to me, there's so many people

215
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:33,447
that are talking shit about how big

216
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:35,104
of an entrepreneur they're gonna be

217
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:36,621
and how much they're gonna achieve

218
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:39,288
and they don't work on weekends.

219
00:08:40,455 --> 00:08:43,104
I worked every Saturday of my 20's.

220
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:46,420
And I talk to 20 year old
entrepreneur every single day.

221
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,576
Lately I've been saying to them,

222
00:08:47,576 --> 00:08:49,836
"This Saturday, you're
gonna have more time off

223
00:08:49,836 --> 00:08:53,371
"then I've had in my
entire 20's on a Saturday."

224
00:08:53,371 --> 00:08:54,696
So before you tell me how you're gonna

225
00:08:54,696 --> 00:08:57,237
be bigger than me, start thinking about

226
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,298
what you're actually doing.

227
00:08:58,298 --> 00:09:01,465
(slow dramatic music)

228
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,462
I'm careful to not give advise

229
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,393
that I know is uniquely something

230
00:09:08,393 --> 00:09:10,310
that I was gifted with.

231
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:13,987
How do I tell you that oh here's how

232
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,848
it actually works and it
almost started happening.

233
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:17,146
It didn't happen.

234
00:09:17,146 --> 00:09:19,763
I actually get goose bumps, like actually.

235
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:22,636
Real heavy goose bumps when I hear

236
00:09:22,636 --> 00:09:25,469
something that I know feels right.

237
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,878
What's the advise there?

238
00:09:27,878 --> 00:09:30,063
Hey Johnny, start getting goosebumps.

239
00:09:30,063 --> 00:09:32,269
There's certain things that I can't

240
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:34,867
talk about because I know
they're not practical.

241
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:35,947
They're intuitive to me.

242
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:39,114
(slow dramatic music)

243
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,544
I plan to instill kindness into my kids.

244
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:49,460
I plan on instilling
perspective into my kids.

245
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,107
I plan on just being a good human being.

246
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:56,144
I plan on making sure they don't use

247
00:09:56,144 --> 00:09:59,525
their parents wealth and micro fame

248
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:02,565
and leverage to impose
on any other person.

249
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:03,972
I was petrified of that.

250
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:06,793
If my kids try to punk their friends

251
00:10:06,793 --> 00:10:10,163
on my shit, I'm gonna
beat the fuck out of them.

252
00:10:10,163 --> 00:10:11,827
That's just loser DNA.

253
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:13,410
You didn't do that.

254
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,656
I'm not obsessed with tactics.

255
00:10:18,656 --> 00:10:20,533
I'm obsessed with religion.

256
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:22,113
I have a lot of wealthy friends,

257
00:10:22,113 --> 00:10:25,030
at this point, who think it's smart

258
00:10:25,972 --> 00:10:28,306
for them to sit first class

259
00:10:28,306 --> 00:10:31,179
put the kids in coach, it's a tactic.

260
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:32,558
They send their kids to Africa

261
00:10:32,558 --> 00:10:34,107
to build a school for a week.

262
00:10:34,107 --> 00:10:34,940
It's a tactic.

263
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,097
It's like my friends that
love the environment.

264
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:39,348
The number two sector in the world

265
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:43,459
that is hurting the environment
is the fashion industry.

266
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:45,901
When you run the math of what's doing bad

267
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:47,989
to the earth, it's the number two

268
00:10:47,989 --> 00:10:50,341
industry behind, I don't even want

269
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:52,336
to say it 'cause I'm not
sure if it's gas and oil.

270
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:54,059
The number two industry, this
and this I know for fact,

271
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:55,523
is the fashion industry.

272
00:10:55,523 --> 00:10:58,164
So all my fancy friends
who love the environment,

273
00:10:58,164 --> 00:11:00,980
are they willing to give up
their fucking Louie bags?

274
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,190
Let's see right?

275
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,625
So I think people talk shit.

276
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,855
You let them sit coach
and you went first class

277
00:11:06,855 --> 00:11:11,368
but you went to Hawaii
and ate at all the best.

278
00:11:11,368 --> 00:11:12,964
You can't pick and choose.

279
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,355
To me it's binary.

280
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:15,206
I don't want to be a hypocrite.

281
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:16,509
My big thing is like look,

282
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,477
you need to be kind.

283
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:22,860
Being mean is just non
negotiable in our family.

284
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,489
And then you just need
to not be full of shit.

285
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:26,728
If you want to look at Daddy's melon

286
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,054
and you want to say what I did

287
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,837
to my dad's and that was a big mountain

288
00:11:29,837 --> 00:11:32,354
for an immigrant like
wow, dad did it right?

289
00:11:32,354 --> 00:11:33,869
If you want to say I'm gonna climb that

290
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:36,358
and I'm gonna climb bigger, awesome.

291
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:39,082
I'm pumped, I'm weirdly
not cheering for you 'cause

292
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:40,261
(man laughs)

293
00:11:40,261 --> 00:11:41,859
I'm just a weirdly competitive dude.

294
00:11:41,859 --> 00:11:44,027
This is actually something
I'm not proud of.

295
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:45,629
I'm comfortable saying this

296
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:47,848
and I believe this is a flaw.

297
00:11:47,848 --> 00:11:50,212
But I don't want my kids
to beat me, I don't.

298
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:51,954
I hate saying it.

299
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:54,026
I know this is where I get in trouble.

300
00:11:54,026 --> 00:11:55,267
People will take one little clip

301
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:56,700
from one video interview and they're like,

302
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,026
"You're bad."

303
00:11:58,026 --> 00:11:58,859
It's just my truth.

304
00:11:58,859 --> 00:11:59,944
I don't want to bullshit you guys.

305
00:11:59,944 --> 00:12:01,608
I'm that competitive.

306
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:04,775
(slow dramatic music)

307
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:18,842
I just want them to be all in on them.

308
00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:21,069
I don't need them to be an entrapuener,

309
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:22,826
I don't need them to make me proud,

310
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,278
they don't need to go to Harvard,

311
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:25,272
they don't need to do shit.

312
00:12:25,272 --> 00:12:26,885
They need to be themselves, all in

313
00:12:26,885 --> 00:12:29,313
and they need to be kind and good.

314
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:32,480
(slow dramatic music)

315
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:36,624
Everybody thinks they're stuff is so good.

316
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:39,977
Every day Gary, my Instagram's so on fire.

317
00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:41,310
It's so awesome.

318
00:12:43,355 --> 00:12:45,159
Why am I not gaining followers?

319
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,159
'Cause it's not awesome.

320
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:51,952
Think, we all think our stuff is the best.

321
00:12:51,952 --> 00:12:53,046
I get that.

322
00:12:53,046 --> 00:12:54,573
But yeah, that would be my advise.

323
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:57,267
Only because that, also, is liberating.

324
00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:59,763
To me, everything's about breathing.

325
00:12:59,763 --> 00:13:01,530
To me, everything is about take

326
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,777
full ownership for everything.

327
00:13:03,777 --> 00:13:04,889
And then everything gets easy.

328
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:07,091
'Cause then you're in control.

329
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:08,972
And then learn how to love to lose.

330
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:11,278
I think that's how entrepreneurship,

331
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:12,176
that's how life is.

332
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:13,676
We all have loses.

333
00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:16,815
I like loses. I love adversity.

334
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:18,231
I like the climb.

335
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,806
I like the chip on my shoulder.

336
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:21,478
I like when people are
like, "Oh I knew it."

337
00:13:21,478 --> 00:13:23,403
"He's not that good."

338
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,697
I'm even weirdly scared as I continue

339
00:13:25,697 --> 00:13:27,607
to ascend and I'm getting popular

340
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,216
and what did he say?

341
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:30,907
The marketing leaning,
people start putting

342
00:13:30,907 --> 00:13:32,279
these words in front of my name.

343
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:37,269
I'm like, am I gonna sabotage
myself to re correct this?

344
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:38,686
I like adversity.

345
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,570
Yeah, all on me.

346
00:13:42,986 --> 00:13:44,400
I enjoy loses.

347
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,758
Now, all of a sudden, like what?

348
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,385
You become completely invincible.

349
00:13:47,385 --> 00:13:48,265
I feel invincible.

350
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:50,812
I really, genuinely, outside of the health

351
00:13:50,812 --> 00:13:54,979
of myself and 20 people feel
100% invisible as a person.

352
00:13:56,758 --> 00:13:58,439
I know what my intent is.

353
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:02,120
I want to do good at
nobody else's expense.

354
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,280
I'm far from perfect, we all are.

355
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,243
It's just easy.

356
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:06,630
It feels very light to live life.

357
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,784
I'm just in a good mood.

358
00:14:07,784 --> 00:14:10,730
(slow dramatic music)

359
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,676
Them home but I think modern day parents

360
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:14,663
and most parents do not do that.

361
00:14:14,663 --> 00:14:17,555
I think they focus on
dumb shit like grades.

362
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:19,411
Because they are insecure

363
00:14:19,411 --> 00:14:21,026
and they want to put the bumper sticker

364
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,861
that their kids went to Stanford.

365
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:25,166
It's real fucked up when you really

366
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,890
think about what's actually happening.

367
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,133
So much of it is misery loves company.

368
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:32,521
Or people reflecting of
what's inside of them.

369
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:35,688
(slow dramatic music)

370
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,563
- What is the impact that you want

371
00:14:43,563 --> 00:14:45,313
to have on the world?

372
00:14:46,921 --> 00:14:50,255
- Same thing that attracts so many

373
00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:52,916
of millions of people to people

374
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,509
that are selling bullshit.

375
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:57,329
Those same people are attracted to me.

376
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,683
And what I want to do is suffocate out

377
00:14:59,683 --> 00:15:00,736
all those other people

378
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:03,728
and become the alpha of that entire world

379
00:15:03,728 --> 00:15:07,311
of people that are
hoping and are desperate

380
00:15:08,471 --> 00:15:10,431
to look at me and what I want to do

381
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:12,943
is inspire two 14 year old girls

382
00:15:12,943 --> 00:15:14,647
in Kansas City, right now,

383
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,801
to build a billion dollar company

384
00:15:16,801 --> 00:15:18,069
on having a bunch of employees

385
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:20,003
hugging each other in the halls.

386
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,509
I think that Steve Jobs came along,

387
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:25,720
became an icon but the sad part

388
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,231
of that narrative was he did not

389
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,970
treat his employees well.

390
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,089
He became an icon and the narrative became

391
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:32,677
he got the most out of people

392
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:35,889
by being a jerk and that
became romanticized.

393
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:37,980
And a lot of people in
Silicone Valley today,

394
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,800
run companies where they're mean

395
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,438
because they think that's
the right thing to do

396
00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:43,616
because they put Steve Jobs on a pedestal.

397
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:45,273
I want my pedestal moment.

398
00:15:45,273 --> 00:15:46,916
I want to become that big

399
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,770
and what I want to come from that

400
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,141
is that kids that aren't even born today,

401
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:53,946
think that they can build a
five billion dollar company

402
00:15:53,946 --> 00:15:56,399
and be a great guy or a great gal.

403
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,803
I want to build the biggest
building in town, ever,

404
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:02,018
by just building the
biggest building in town.

405
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:03,501
While I think most people try to tear

406
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:05,354
down everybody else's building.

407
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:08,491
So I think positivity and good

408
00:16:08,491 --> 00:16:11,039
is practical advise to building an empire

409
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,365
and I want to be the poster child

410
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:14,039
of the person that built the biggest,

411
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,506
baddest, empire and did it by being

412
00:16:17,506 --> 00:16:19,553
a good dude along the way.

413
00:16:19,553 --> 00:16:21,062
And not everybody's gonna be happy

414
00:16:21,062 --> 00:16:22,426
about everything that I did

415
00:16:22,426 --> 00:16:25,033
but if it's 97% of people talking good

416
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:27,406
behind your back, that's a real legacy.

417
00:16:27,406 --> 00:16:29,751
And I want to do it in a pop culture way.

418
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:30,584
I'm gonna do it anyway.

419
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:31,534
People have done that before.

420
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:32,995
Just so you know,
there's plenty of people.

421
00:16:32,995 --> 00:16:35,537
Warren Buffet's a really good dude.

422
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:38,122
There's plenty of people
that have done that.

423
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,117
There's a difference.

424
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:41,553
I want to do it and I
want to be a rock star.

425
00:16:41,553 --> 00:16:45,259
And that's where you influence people.

426
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:46,850
I want to do it but I also want

427
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,511
to be the most popular.

428
00:16:48,511 --> 00:16:49,732
And so then that person's like,

429
00:16:49,732 --> 00:16:53,430
I want to be him so I guess I'll be nice.

430
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,804
I want to literally take people

431
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:57,158
who have DNA that's kind of nice

432
00:16:57,158 --> 00:16:58,863
and make them more nice because

433
00:16:58,863 --> 00:17:01,909
they think that's how I became big.

434
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:03,954
So I basically want to trick

435
00:17:03,954 --> 00:17:06,679
the business world into becoming kinder.

436
00:17:06,679 --> 00:00:00,000
(slow dramatic music)
