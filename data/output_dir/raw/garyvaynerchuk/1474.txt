mountain coffee they can get cups so for

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,070
a larger purchase item right where think

13
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,330
about autos for instance yeah it's like

14
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,220
average<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 to 10 different</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sources to actually buy your product and</font>

16
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,219

once every couple years<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a higher</font>

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,690

back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you actually getting lead</font>

22
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,440
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like the most interesting</font>

23
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,730
question for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me in the whole space</font>

24
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,410
especially around social in the content

25
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,050
within it the answer is you use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

26
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,399
model<font color="#CCCCCC"> used for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything else right</font>

27
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,440
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an impression somewhere along the</font>

28
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,329
decision-making path right and so a lot

29
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people come to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and like well</font>

30
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,329
what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ROI of the social media</font>

31
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:01,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">content we're producing and then I'm</font>

32
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">always asking them cool like awesome and</font>

33
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,339
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was a real question for me</font>

34
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,689
asking them because I was just getting

35
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:07,979
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the industry I'm like well how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

36
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do it for outdoor media how do you</font>

37
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,850
do it for your print how are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

38
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,320
it for your commercials and the answers

39
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,960
were straight garbage right I

40
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,460
started like calling my you know nerd

41
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,930
 friends at MIT and they're like

42
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,150
this is math I'm like right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

43
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,560
like you know so the funny thing is is I

44
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,790
continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to figure out when they</font>

45
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me that question why they don't</font>

46
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an answer for any of the</font>

47
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,140
traditional other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

48

<font color="#CCCCCC">Nielsen's told them you know is it's you</font>

49
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,070
know it hurts right you know you like

50
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,340
like the math that i I've a national I

51
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,770
have a big television client and they

52
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,570
are spending so much money on outdoor

53
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,790
media right and I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool i'm like</font>

54
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,560
by the way as you're debating my scope

55
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,450
over here for this nothing money

56
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,009
that you put in one billboard in

57
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,350
Kansas can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain to me what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

58
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,689
ROI that billboard is and nobody's ever

59
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,790
got an answer there's models there's

60
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,439
things that our industry has accepted

61
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,570
you know your company in the print

62
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,640
business we've expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> the accepted three</font>

63
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,680
times circulation when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I finally learned</font>

64
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,939
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> months ago what that meant was</font>

65
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,479
Oh Jane might leave her vogue in

66
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,209
a bus and I might come up pick it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and</font>

67
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,180
go to page 14

68
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">7 and see the Jaguar ad right I</font>

69
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,019
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that's up right</font>

70
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:22,599
right aight respect good brand right so

71
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,269
you know i mean i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

72
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:26,590
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been except in this world</font>

73
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,180
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's funny you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know now that i'm not</font>

74
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,099
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my wine shop which is over there in</font>

75
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:31,989
New Jersey every time I come once every

76
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:34,180
2-3 months everything's broken when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

77
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,430
was in it it all seemed right I'd been

78
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,650
in at my whole life you know I I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was so</font>

79
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,349
successful but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like with a new</font>

80
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:43,450
I it's like so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are flawed</font>

81
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,040
the things I've learned from other areas

82
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,260
I feel like I walk around<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this world</font>

83
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,109
and I'm like wow how like wow right you

84
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:52,569
know you come with fresh eyes I think

85
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:54,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot of that is being</font>

86
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,919
accepted that is not true I mean you

87
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,810
know some dudes stood at the top of that

88
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">building clicked how many cars drove i</font>

89
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,040
multiplied it and came up with a price

90
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,810
for the billboard that's on you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

91
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,810
second it's ridiculous<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know as I</font>

92
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,250
told<font color="#CCCCCC"> that client and I'd like to say in</font>

93
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,290
keynotes and some of you've seen this um

94
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,870
you know when you drop when you you know

95
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,519
we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York so you know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

96
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">you might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be from the west coast when</font>

97
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:18,340
your home when you drive the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

98
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,440
watch how many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the five</font>

99
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">people you drive past or on their cell</font>

100
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,129
phone while they're driving at least

101
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:26,229
three of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the five at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I always</font>

102
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:27,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell my clients I'm like people are</font>

103
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,319
looking at billboard's they're not even

104
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,209
looking at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> road anymore and</font>

105
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,699
so I think it's every person in this

106
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:36,669
room's job to care about one thing where

107
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:38,560
are the eyes and ears of the end

108
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,540
consumer and the eyes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ears are</font>

109
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,340
shifting that last panel<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're clearly</font>

110
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,379
in mobile but very honestly I've been

111
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:45,879
like obsessed with mobile for the last

112
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,500
three years it's all I think about most

113
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,030
of things I investin try to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

114
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,310
how to storytelling it but now very

115
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,540
honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> after playing around with</font>

116
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,819
google glasses I'm like I'm like

117
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,709
all right now this right and so like

118
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:58,239
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen when somebody</font>

119
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,090
goes into a supermarket and my clients

120
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,340
product has some bad news on it and when

121
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,109
they look at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's physically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

122
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:06,189
be there and giving them information

123
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:08,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the recall or why it's not healthy</font>

124
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:09,879
I mean you know it's we're not going to

125
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,560
need McDonald's to put the calories on

126
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,269
the sign we're gonna get it if we want

127
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:14,829
it based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the app's we put on our</font>

128
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:16,899
Google glasses and that's 36 months away

129
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,029
it's gonna be here<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a heartbeat so at</font>

130
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,680
the end of the day we can talk about

131
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,779
tactics in here all we want and we

132
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:24,219
should be executing because it matters

133
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:26,229
but I think there's a philosophy ship

134
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:26,500
that

135
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,150
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen overall which is we have</font>

136
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the consumer not from us I</font>

137
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,830
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's way too much us talk and</font>

138
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,810
us think what we want what's good for us

139
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,730
this will be good for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this happens</font>

140
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,650
if you reverse engineer what they want

141
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,300
you have a far better chance of the

142
00:04:40,300 --> 00:00:00,000
conversion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're all looking for</font>
