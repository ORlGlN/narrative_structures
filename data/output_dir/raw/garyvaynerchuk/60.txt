1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,077
- You can't get caught up in the game

2
00:00:02,077 --> 00:00:04,225
that most nine to 11
year old entrepreneurs

3
00:00:04,225 --> 00:00:05,908
are getting caught up in that I talk to.

4
00:00:05,908 --> 00:00:08,596
(audience laughs)

5
00:00:08,596 --> 00:00:09,429
Oh, what?

6
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:12,489
You don't see what I'm
doin' on musical.ly?

7
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:13,591
That was funny, right?

8
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:15,110
My life's funny.

9
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,693
(upbeat music)

10
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:30,201
- Over there.

11
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:31,082
That girl.

12
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:33,511
- I've been working on this startup myself

13
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:36,394
and despite everyone being really nice,

14
00:00:36,394 --> 00:00:38,374
I've always noticed that
they're sort of like,

15
00:00:38,374 --> 00:00:39,809
you're a bit too young to do this.

16
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:40,653
- [Gary] Yes.

17
00:00:40,653 --> 00:00:43,309
- How do you get passed the
stereotypes or limitations?

18
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,792
- I think you know the answer, Hilary.

19
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:47,365
I think it's in your own head, right?

20
00:00:47,365 --> 00:00:49,180
The bottom line is

21
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,097
do you agree with them?

22
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:53,442
Great.

23
00:00:53,442 --> 00:00:54,765
You're on your fuckin' way.

24
00:00:54,765 --> 00:00:56,259
(laughter)

25
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:57,212
Right?

26
00:00:57,212 --> 00:00:59,185
Like listen, is your mom here?

27
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:00,191
There she is.

28
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:03,191
You know, you've already won, right?

29
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,467
Your question,

30
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:07,988
do you want to hear
something interesting Hilary?

31
00:01:07,988 --> 00:01:09,541
I don't think you even believe

32
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,428
in the question you just asked me.

33
00:01:11,428 --> 00:01:12,952
And that is the ultimate compliment.

34
00:01:12,952 --> 00:01:15,478
Because spending time with
you back stage yesterday

35
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:17,928
I think that's a cute question

36
00:01:17,928 --> 00:01:21,602
but I actually don't
think you give a shit.

37
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:24,380
Do you give a shit
about what people think?

38
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,755
- Occasionally.

39
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:26,826
- Right.

40
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:28,086
I respect that.

41
00:01:28,086 --> 00:01:30,272
(audience laughs)

42
00:01:30,272 --> 00:01:31,987
(applause)

43
00:01:31,987 --> 00:01:32,820
Hilary,

44
00:01:33,896 --> 00:01:36,540
I'm gonna tell you something
really, you're 12 right?

45
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,373
- (Hillary) Yep.

46
00:01:37,373 --> 00:01:39,494
- Yeah, so I'm gonna tell
you something super exciting.

47
00:01:39,494 --> 00:01:43,172
When I was 12, I occasionally
cared what people thought too.

48
00:01:43,172 --> 00:01:45,755
That shit goes away real quick.

49
00:01:47,262 --> 00:01:49,014
That's the answer.

50
00:01:49,014 --> 00:01:50,269
Like, why?

51
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:51,102
Like, what?

52
00:01:51,102 --> 00:01:54,620
Your teacher or your Uncle Rick fuckin'

53
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,747
thinks that you're too early?

54
00:01:56,747 --> 00:01:59,020
It's just not gonna
matter in the end Hilary.

55
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,365
Here's what's gonna happen,

56
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:02,941
either you're right, or they're right.

57
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:04,770
That's what's gonna happen at the end.

58
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,579
Spending any time debating who's cheering

59
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:10,055
for one outcome or one point of view

60
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:12,972
is a complete waste of your energy.

61
00:02:14,644 --> 00:02:17,525
- Hi, I'm Bianca Rashel from California,

62
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:19,322
well, not California, San Francisco,

63
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:20,505
(laughter)

64
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:21,599
- [Gary] How old are you?

65
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,057
- I'm nine.

66
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:23,989
- It's so nice to meet you.

67
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:25,216
- It's nice to meet you too.

68
00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:28,137
I'm a rapper and a business owner.

69
00:02:28,137 --> 00:02:30,810
I come to events like Complex Con.

70
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,103
I come to network because I push myself

71
00:02:34,103 --> 00:02:37,353
and create partnership with the brands.

72
00:02:38,587 --> 00:02:40,568
Do you think I'm goin
about it the wrong way?

73
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:43,397
- You are definitely not
going about it the wrong way.

74
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:47,147
(audience laughs and cheers)

75
00:02:49,947 --> 00:02:51,466
Little one, you might be going about it

76
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:52,758
the best fuckin' way here.

77
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:55,960
(audience laughs)

78
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,884
Are you enjoying it?

79
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:57,906
- Yeah.

80
00:02:57,906 --> 00:02:58,739
- You love it?

81
00:02:58,739 --> 00:02:59,572
- Yeah.

82
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:00,886
- What are you gonna do when you grow up?

83
00:03:00,886 --> 00:03:04,469
- Well, I'm a rapper
so I really, I really,

84
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:07,640
I dream about going on tours.

85
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,473
- [Gary] Yep.

86
00:03:08,473 --> 00:03:11,613
- Everybody here they're
comin' to see you.

87
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:13,423
I want them to be like that to me.

88
00:03:13,423 --> 00:03:14,671
- I love that.

89
00:03:14,671 --> 00:03:15,504
Listen to me.

90
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:18,586
Can I give you a real, real,
real good piece of advice

91
00:03:18,586 --> 00:03:20,176
that's gonna be really
hard for you to take

92
00:03:20,176 --> 00:03:21,437
but please remember it?

93
00:03:21,437 --> 00:03:23,884
Hopefully when we chop up this
video we'll send it to you?

94
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:25,073
- [Hilary] Mhmm.

95
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:28,608
- The number one thing you have is time.

96
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,102
You have something in
here that all of us envy

97
00:03:31,102 --> 00:03:33,985
which is an extra 30
years, and extra 20 years,

98
00:03:33,985 --> 00:03:35,225
an extra 15 years.

99
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:36,389
Do you understand?

100
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:37,441
- [Bianca] Yeah.

101
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:39,586
- You can't get caught up in the game that

102
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,132
most nine to 11 year old entrepreneurs

103
00:03:41,132 --> 00:03:42,957
are getting caught up in that I talk to.

104
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:45,684
(audience laughs)

105
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:46,517
Oh what?

106
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,984
You don't see what I'm
doin' on musical.ly?

107
00:03:48,984 --> 00:03:50,067
Listen to me.

108
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:53,333
That was funny, right?

109
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,296
My life's funny.

110
00:03:54,296 --> 00:03:55,989
(audience laughs)

111
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:57,311
Listen, listen to me.

112
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:58,988
The thing that a lot of, you know,

113
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,858
single digit entrepreneurs
are getting caught up with

114
00:04:00,858 --> 00:04:03,865
is you care too much
about how many subscribers

115
00:04:03,865 --> 00:04:05,503
and followers you got.

116
00:04:05,503 --> 00:04:09,018
If you promise me this
it will help you so much.

117
00:04:09,018 --> 00:04:12,655
If you just make the songs
that are in your heart,

118
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:14,660
if you just make the content you want.

119
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,969
If I could get you to just
never look at how many followers

120
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:20,863
you have for the next
10 years, you will win.

121
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,155
It's gonna be hard.

122
00:04:22,155 --> 00:04:23,877
All your friends are gonna ask how many.

123
00:04:23,877 --> 00:04:26,045
You know, everybody here
cares about how many

124
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:27,131
and they're grown.

125
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:28,730
But if you can get to that place

126
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:32,266
where you don't care about that one thing

127
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:35,989
it will help you so much
you could never imagine.

128
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:37,130
- [Bianca] Okay.

129
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:37,963
- Can I tell you something else?

130
00:04:37,963 --> 00:04:40,046
- [Bianca] Yeah.

131
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,004
- If you talk about your real life,

132
00:04:42,004 --> 00:04:43,966
which is obviously very
different than our real life,

133
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:46,694
based on how you see things in the world,

134
00:04:46,694 --> 00:04:49,611
it will be really interesting shit.

135
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:52,100
- Yeah, that's how my songs are.

136
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,312
I don't tell fake stuff

137
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:57,668
I really, I don't want to tell fake stuff,

138
00:04:57,668 --> 00:05:00,353
I want to tell my life
story and how I got here.

139
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:01,664
- I love it.

140
00:05:01,664 --> 00:05:02,898
Keep gettin' your thing girl.

141
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:04,343
I love you.

142
00:05:04,343 --> 00:05:06,592
(audience applause)

143
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:07,898
- [CJ] Hey, Gary.

144
00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:08,856
- Hey bro.

145
00:05:08,856 --> 00:05:09,689
- [CJ] How's your day been?

146
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:10,522
- I'm doin' really good CJ.

147
00:05:10,522 --> 00:05:11,355
How are you?

148
00:05:11,355 --> 00:05:12,188
- Good.

149
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:15,725
Okay, so I just turned
13 and I was wondering.

150
00:05:15,725 --> 00:05:19,508
Or I've been doing YouTube
for about two years.

151
00:05:19,508 --> 00:05:20,418
- [Gary] Yeah.

152
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:22,622
- And the first year I didn't
really get anything done.

153
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,808
- [Gary] Okay.

154
00:05:23,808 --> 00:05:24,781
- But up until this.

155
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:26,296
- [Gary] Get anything done
as in it didn't get traction

156
00:05:26,296 --> 00:05:28,121
or you were bullshitting
playing video games.

157
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:29,815
- Uh, second, both of them.

158
00:05:29,815 --> 00:05:30,746
Both of them.

159
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:33,086
(audience laughs)

160
00:05:33,086 --> 00:05:34,574
So, but then this summer.

161
00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:35,651
- [Gary] This summer.

162
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:38,233
- I start to get more
like, I quit video games

163
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:41,733
and I got a better view time and traction.

164
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:44,012
- [Gary] Yep.

165
00:05:44,012 --> 00:05:46,303
- But I'm still like,
I'm at one 42 right now.

166
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:49,644
So I'm wondering like what's
one tip for kids my age.

167
00:05:49,644 --> 00:05:51,771
- [Gary] One 42 meaning what?

168
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:52,775
- One hundred and 42 subs.

169
00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:53,737
- Got it.

170
00:05:53,737 --> 00:05:55,805
So what do you want to have, CJ?

171
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:59,672
- I just want to get at least
300 by the end of the year.

172
00:05:59,672 --> 00:06:02,626
- Okay, well, first of all,
we'll take care of that.

173
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:05,940
(audience laughs)

174
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,773
Right?

175
00:06:06,773 --> 00:06:07,980
So like, now what?

176
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,355
- Just to inspire people.

177
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:12,650
- Good, so if you want to inspire people,

178
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,998
that's real, right?

179
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,660
If that's really what you're about

180
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,274
then you don't need to
do anything but continue

181
00:06:18,274 --> 00:06:20,739
to put out the content that
you think will do that.

182
00:06:20,739 --> 00:06:21,984
- [CJ] Thank you.

183
00:06:21,984 --> 00:06:24,123
- I think the reason I said
we'll take care of that

184
00:06:24,123 --> 00:06:26,944
is what I don't want you to
do that so many people do

185
00:06:26,944 --> 00:06:29,027
whether they're 13 or 81,

186
00:06:29,886 --> 00:06:31,414
so many people get into the rat race

187
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:33,720
of how many followers they have, right?

188
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,367
And that's just not the
game that you wanna play.

189
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:38,378
Do you know what I mean?

190
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:40,545
Because the realty is that

191
00:06:41,412 --> 00:06:43,849
that's gonna dictate too many actions.

192
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:46,461
You can't let your self
esteem or your self worth

193
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:48,910
be wrapped up into metrics on YouTube

194
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,570
because it's one tiny proxy

195
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,473
in the realty of what you're up to.

196
00:06:52,473 --> 00:06:54,740
Do you understand?

197
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,706
- [CJ] (sniffles) Thank you.

198
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,228
- You're welcome.

199
00:06:57,228 --> 00:07:00,228
(audience applause)

200
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:05,591
Yeah, we're gonna throw
a right hook right now.

201
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,482
What's the name of your channel CJ?

202
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:08,315
- [CJ] CJ Boling.

203
00:07:08,315 --> 00:07:09,196
- [Gary] Spell it.

204
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,068
- C-J B-O-L-I-N-G.

205
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:12,401
- [Gary] Slower, because
you actually want them

206
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:13,440
to actually fuckin' follow you.

207
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,547
(audience laughs)

208
00:07:15,547 --> 00:07:16,663
CJ,

209
00:07:16,663 --> 00:07:18,531
- B-O-L-I-N-G.

210
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:20,225
- [Gary] B-O-L-I-N-G?

211
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:23,002
It would really mean a whole
lot to me if I've given

212
00:07:23,002 --> 00:07:24,872
you one inch of value in my life

213
00:07:24,872 --> 00:07:26,740
for you to follow this kid.

214
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,620
Let's think about how many
followers he has on YouTube

215
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,111
by the end of this weekend.

216
00:07:31,111 --> 00:07:32,159
- Thank you.

217
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,328
- [Gary] Get in here Ceej.

218
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,875
Come here.

219
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,958
- And my mom I didn't even know that,

220
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:41,334
I didn't even know that I was meeting you.

221
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:42,788
When I first saw you I was like.

222
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:45,448
I was just speechless.

223
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:46,928
- I'm so glad we got to meet little man.

224
00:07:46,928 --> 00:07:48,619
You like the content?

225
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:49,452
- Mhmm.

226
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:50,378
- What are you gonna do when you grow up?

227
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:51,508
- I wanna be a YouTuber.

228
00:07:51,508 --> 00:07:52,594
- My man.

229
00:07:52,594 --> 00:07:53,722
Alright.

230
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:54,615
What are you gonna talk about?

231
00:07:54,615 --> 00:07:56,320
- I don't know really.

232
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,442
- You'll figure it out?

233
00:07:57,442 --> 00:07:58,579
- Yeah.

234
00:07:58,579 --> 00:07:59,808
- Are you makin' some content now?

235
00:07:59,808 --> 00:08:00,641
- Yeah.

236
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:01,474
- What are you talkin' about?

237
00:08:01,474 --> 00:08:02,307
Your life?

238
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:03,502
Your interests?

239
00:08:03,502 --> 00:08:04,335
- Yeah.

240
00:08:04,335 --> 00:08:05,168
- The stuff you're into?

241
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:06,001
- Mhmm.

242
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:06,853
- What are you into?

243
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:07,745
- Like gaming and stuff.

244
00:08:07,745 --> 00:08:08,666
- Mhmm.

245
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,183
I'm glad we met man.

246
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:11,519
Want to take a photo?

247
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,519
Let's do it.

248
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:14,838
- [Woman] Here we go!

249
00:08:14,838 --> 00:08:16,171
One, two, three.

250
00:08:17,936 --> 00:08:18,769
Alright.

251
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:19,731
- Can you do me a favor?

252
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:23,562
Don't ever, ever, ever, ever worry about

253
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:25,553
how many people are
subscribed to your channel.

254
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:28,311
The number one reason kids lose on YouTube

255
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:30,726
is they care too much about

256
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:33,006
how many people are subscribed to them.

257
00:08:33,006 --> 00:08:34,182
Just be patient.

258
00:08:34,183 --> 00:08:35,339
Make good content.

259
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,299
Nobody was following me
for a long long time.

260
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,125
Longer than you were alive right now.

261
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,352
Got it?

262
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:41,185
- Yea.

263
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:42,019
- You understand?

264
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:43,852
You promise?

265
00:08:43,852 --> 00:08:44,784
My man.

266
00:08:44,784 --> 00:08:46,166
- [Woman] Great, awesome.

267
00:08:46,166 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
