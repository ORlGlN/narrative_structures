1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,007
(hip hop music)

2
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:23,336
- Dad, one thing I talk a lot about

3
00:00:23,336 --> 00:00:25,040
is how much you work, right?

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,287
Like my work ethic completely
inspired by you and mom,

5
00:00:28,287 --> 00:00:30,591
the way she worked the
house, but more you.

6
00:00:30,591 --> 00:00:32,758
We really didn't hang out.

7
00:00:34,656 --> 00:00:35,949
Like, you know.

8
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:37,782
- No you got fired
- [Voiceover] The number you

9
00:00:37,782 --> 00:00:39,497
dialed is not in service.

10
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,239
- We don't need to talk
about when I got fired,

11
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:42,352
the one time.

12
00:00:42,352 --> 00:00:43,484
- Well why not.

13
00:00:43,484 --> 00:00:44,756
- Fine listen
- Tell them

14
00:00:44,756 --> 00:00:47,271
Build the character
- Go on tell them the story

15
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:49,090
- Gary asked for

16
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,014
- Two hours off.

17
00:00:51,014 --> 00:00:53,984
Not a day off, left, asked to
leave early for a high school

18
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:56,543
party, you know when you
graduate high school people

19
00:00:56,543 --> 00:00:57,539
have parties?

20
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,080
I asked on a Saturday to leave
to five instead of seven PM.

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,272
And I worked every summer day, these are,

22
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:07,230
this is real stuff.
- No questions about it

23
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,515
- I asked to leave at five
instead of seven, one day.

24
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:12,955
And we would leave the house
at seven to open the store.

25
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:15,788
So seven to five, or nine to five,

26
00:01:16,736 --> 00:01:18,006
I don't care what you think.

27
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:20,825
You know, two hours early,
hanging up on this one hold on,

28
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:22,003
I gotta tell this story.

29
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:23,820
He looked me dead in the
face and said, 'you're not

30
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,730
committed to the business, you're fired'.

31
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,480
- He came home and he was crying.

32
00:01:30,284 --> 00:01:33,484
And of course his mother
had to get involved.

33
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:36,113
- And then I was, I went
from crying, cuz I cried, to

34
00:01:36,113 --> 00:01:39,801
smiling because I actually
didn't work the next day and

35
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:43,529
since I'd been working my whole
high school life I was like

36
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:47,621
wait a minute, this is, I'm
like, this is interesting.

37
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:50,077
- Give me a lap down
- Little AJ, I didn't.

38
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,312
Not yet, this was before that.

39
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:55,403
- Right because Joe
- This was 94.

40
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:57,130
This was playing Nintendo.

41
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,769
- That was the Rangers' year.

42
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:00,271
- Right so I was like this is amazing.

43
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:04,380
And then my dad, didn't come
to apologize, he just walked

44
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,942
in my room the next day and
goes 'you're coming to work'

45
00:02:06,942 --> 00:02:07,942
- That's it.

46
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,538
- That's really what happened.

47
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:12,539
(music)

48
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,582
- You know what's so crazy,
because he was such an

49
00:02:19,582 --> 00:02:23,349
absolute failure with academics,
you can hold that over

50
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:25,144
anybody who got B's.

51
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:26,669
You're like, you got B's dude?

52
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:28,484
You square-ass motherfucker
that got B's and C's.

53
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:29,734
I'm like Jesus.

54
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:32,605
- It's so crazy how like
entrepreneurship and like, it's

55
00:02:32,605 --> 00:02:34,807
like on the, like I'm living
in a Bizzaro world I'm like

56
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:37,731
fuck this, if I was making
$4000 a weekend when I was 12,

57
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:41,908
in 2017, I'd be like fucking,
genius, the next this.

58
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:44,700
I was getting shit on by
everybody because I didn't read

59
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,436
Catcher in the Rye.

60
00:02:46,436 --> 00:02:47,605
You know, over the weekend.

61
00:02:47,605 --> 00:02:50,375
(laughter)

62
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,573
- Um, so back to what
we were talking about.

63
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,368
- Did you pause because you
were like fuck I read that in

64
00:02:54,368 --> 00:02:55,392
one hour.

65
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:58,073
- No, no, no
- Yes, straight up.

66
00:02:58,073 --> 00:03:00,086
Guys, post that in, put
A's all over his face.

67
00:03:00,086 --> 00:03:01,708
- No, no, no,

68
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,487
- Jake I want A's all over his face.

69
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:04,482
- No!

70
00:03:04,482 --> 00:03:05,481
This is 100% why.

71
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:09,120
He keeps going, he was like
there are, you guys know this,

72
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,945
there's like 15 videos in the
IG video of him being like

73
00:03:11,945 --> 00:03:14,831
I was a loser, I was a loser,
people called me a loser for

74
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:16,081
getting D's and F's.

75
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:17,080
You fucking suck.

76
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,080
(music)

77
00:03:23,763 --> 00:03:25,677
- Here's something that
nobody else will tell you.

78
00:03:25,677 --> 00:03:28,504
If somebody goes to a restaurant
for the first time and has

79
00:03:28,504 --> 00:03:31,480
a flawless experience, the
statistical likelihood of them

80
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,528
doing a second visit is about 40%.

81
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:37,714
They come back a second time
- Yeah I'd believe that.

82
00:03:37,714 --> 00:03:40,756
- And have a flawless
experience, the statistical

83
00:03:40,756 --> 00:03:44,923
likelihood of a third
visit is still about 42%.

84
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:49,763
The third time they come,
the statistical likelihood of

85
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,430
a fourth visit is over 70%.

86
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,303
- Whoa.

87
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:57,490
- So, you gotta market
to three visits, not one.

88
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,135
Visit one, free rib dinner
- Wow that's huge.

89
00:04:00,135 --> 00:04:02,198
- You sit em down, put a red
napkin on the table, not a

90
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:03,393
white one.

91
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:06,110
Identify them as a first time
customer, connect with them

92
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,721
and work to get them back a
second time and a third time.

93
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:11,365
Once they're there a
third time, you own em.

94
00:04:11,365 --> 00:04:13,669
- My man, Chandler,
- The red napkin thing

95
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:16,492
is genius, holy cuz you know
in a fast, casual environment,

96
00:04:16,492 --> 00:04:18,435
we're not hitting that table a lot but.

97
00:04:18,435 --> 00:04:21,350
- Let me give you
- A napkin that's red.

98
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,687
- Chandler let me give you
- Can I detail that for him?

99
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:24,364
- Go ahead.

100
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,683
- Okay so you put a red napkin
at the table, Gary sits down,

101
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:27,321
he's eating his dinner, now he's getting

102
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:28,696
his free rib dinner, all his
water will cost him nothing.

103
00:04:28,696 --> 00:04:30,968
I know he's a first time
customer because he's got a

104
00:04:30,968 --> 00:04:32,130
red napkin.

105
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,668
When he's leaving the manager
comes to the table writes on

106
00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:36,855
the back of a business card,
five dollars off chicken.

107
00:04:36,855 --> 00:04:38,957
Did you like the ribs?

108
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:40,126
Loved em.

109
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:41,197
You gotta try my chicken,
come in for the chicken.

110
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,709
Now I'm prompting a second
visit, not with a printed

111
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:46,387
coupon, a handwritten card.

112
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:47,389
- Yeah.

113
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:49,207
- Now he comes in for the
second visit, drops the business

114
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:52,484
card on the table, everybody
knows this is the second visit.

115
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:54,868
Cuz red napkin was the first visit.

116
00:04:54,868 --> 00:04:57,259
Second visit you finish the
meal you go up you say so

117
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:59,269
how was the chicken?

118
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:00,371
It was fricken great.

119
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:01,513
Are you full, totally stuffed.

120
00:05:01,513 --> 00:05:04,203
Man, next time you
gotta try my cheesecake.

121
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,841
Free piece of cheescake.

122
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:08,273
Now, three visits.

123
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:09,926
- Wait a pizza?

124
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:11,163
- A piece of cheesecake.

125
00:05:11,163 --> 00:05:13,060
- Oh I thought a pizza
flavored cheesecake I was like

126
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,072
that's fuckin brilliant.

127
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:17,427
- Okay so the rib dinner cost
me five dollars, the chicken

128
00:05:17,427 --> 00:05:19,887
was a washout because it was
a discount, the cheesecake

129
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:21,137
is a dollar 35.

130
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,372
For about six dollars you got
three visits out of him with

131
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:28,050
a 70% likelihood of a fourth.

132
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,097
That's the way you market your
restaurant within the four

133
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:31,221
walls of it.

134
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:33,221
(music)

135
00:05:38,277 --> 00:05:40,877
- Jewel for the four people
who may not know who you are,

136
00:05:40,877 --> 00:05:43,605
why don't you give a little
context of, a little bit about

137
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:45,875
your career and who you are.

138
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,548
- Okay my name is Jewel, it's
my real name, these are my

139
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,695
real teeth, nobody asks me
that but I just thought I'd

140
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:51,977
throw it out there.

141
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,509
I'm from Alaska my family were pioneers.

142
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:57,366
I grew up on a homestead, which
means I grew up eating only

143
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:59,612
what I could kill or can.

144
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:01,852
So my fang came in really handy.

145
00:06:01,852 --> 00:06:03,132
It didn't actually.

146
00:06:03,132 --> 00:06:07,090
It taught me resilience, it
taught me grit, it taught me

147
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,173
how to grind.

148
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:11,817
It taught me self esteem from
the inside out which is being

149
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:14,764
able to understand that you're
capable because you've been

150
00:06:14,764 --> 00:06:17,692
given the opportunity to struggle
which is a real blessing.

151
00:06:17,692 --> 00:06:22,327
And I ended up moving out at
15, I ended up homeless at 18,

152
00:06:22,327 --> 00:06:23,660
was shoplifting.

153
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:26,503
- Why'd you originally move out at 15.

154
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:28,982
- My dad was abusive and so I
decided I would just live in

155
00:06:28,982 --> 00:06:30,811
a cabin by myself.

156
00:06:30,811 --> 00:06:33,343
We'd been pretty transient,
moved around a lot.

157
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:36,454
And I'd taken care of myself
quite a long time so I wanted

158
00:06:36,454 --> 00:06:38,481
to do it on my own, without
somebody in the cabin

159
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,731
besides myself.

160
00:06:41,094 --> 00:06:43,722
So too young to drive, I was
hitchhiking into work, at a

161
00:06:43,722 --> 00:06:46,454
pretty young age, working multiple jobs.

162
00:06:46,454 --> 00:06:47,529
- Where?

163
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:49,251
- In Homer, Alaska.

164
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:52,028
And then I got a scholarship
to an amazing art school in

165
00:06:52,028 --> 00:06:54,177
a roundabout way in Michigan.

166
00:06:54,177 --> 00:06:56,200
Was able to graduate high school, yay me.

167
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,453
And most importantly, if I
look back on my life, I knew

168
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,678
that at 15 I should've been a statistic.

169
00:07:02,678 --> 00:07:05,657
When I was homeless, I ended
up homeless when I was about

170
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:08,383
18, I turned down the
advances of my boss and when I

171
00:07:08,383 --> 00:07:11,301
wouldn't have sex with him, he
wouldn't give me my paycheck.

172
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:14,504
And so I thought no big deal,
I'll live in my car for a

173
00:07:14,504 --> 00:07:16,474
couple of months and
I'll get back on my feet.

174
00:07:16,474 --> 00:07:18,732
But then the car I was living
in got stolen and so that's

175
00:07:18,732 --> 00:07:21,654
how I ended up homeless and I
started having panic attacks

176
00:07:21,654 --> 00:07:23,993
I began shoplifting a lot.

177
00:07:23,993 --> 00:07:26,142
So I found a coffee shop, it
was going out of business.

178
00:07:26,142 --> 00:07:27,999
And I said hey before you
close your doors, give me two

179
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:31,480
weeks and give me all the door
money and you can have all

180
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,565
the coffee and the sales and food.

181
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:35,654
And so we struck a deal and
I suddenly had to go out and

182
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:38,084
get a following, and I had
to write a bunch of songs.

183
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:40,759
Cuz I grew up singing
cover songs with my dad.

184
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,282
So I wrote and wrote and
wrote, I handed out flyers, I

185
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:46,136
hustled, I had two people
in my coffee shop the first

186
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:48,385
night, and I sang a five hour set.

187
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,023
And I sang my heart out.

188
00:07:50,023 --> 00:07:52,341
And what I learned is
that I was very lonely.

189
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:54,797
And a lot of people are lonely,
and I deserved to be lonely

190
00:07:54,797 --> 00:07:57,234
because I only told truth
in one place and it was in a

191
00:07:57,234 --> 00:07:59,378
notebook that nobody read.

192
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:02,063
And I decided to take a risk
and be vulnerable and talk

193
00:08:02,063 --> 00:08:05,017
about what was real and
not hide from the truth.

194
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:08,169
And so I poured all of my
feelings out in front of these

195
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:10,066
two surfers, bless their hearts.

196
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:11,727
- By the way if you're watching,
either one of the surfers,

197
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:13,236
please leave a comment.

198
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:14,728
(laughter)

199
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,334
They're like holy shit I was that dude.

200
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:19,238
- Yeah and then the next week
four people, the next week

201
00:08:19,238 --> 00:08:21,190
seven, I played there every
week to try and have a very

202
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,273
regular time.

203
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,556
And after about a year, it
was sold out and people were

204
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:28,933
standing outside the windows,
standing in pouring rain for

205
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:31,393
five hours listening
to me through a window.

206
00:08:31,393 --> 00:08:35,495
And a radio put a bootleg
of mine on the air, it ended

207
00:08:35,495 --> 00:08:38,380
up requested and I got
into the top ten countdown.

208
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,409
Top ten countdown on 91X in
San Diego, it's one of the

209
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,798
biggest stations in the country.

210
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,884
Labels were like who the
heck is this girl on acoustic

211
00:08:44,884 --> 00:08:46,787
guitar playing between
Nirvana and Soundgarden?

212
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:49,550
They all started showing up so
it was like being Cinderella.

213
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,918
You know limousines were showing up.

214
00:08:51,918 --> 00:08:52,914
- Really?

215
00:08:52,914 --> 00:08:53,981
- Yeah.

216
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:56,122
So you'd think I would jump
at the opportunity to have a

217
00:08:56,122 --> 00:08:58,652
record label, or a record
deal, except that I had just

218
00:08:58,652 --> 00:09:00,803
found happiness and I was
not going to give it up.

219
00:09:00,803 --> 00:09:04,283
And fame is a path so many
people lose their footing on.

220
00:09:04,283 --> 00:09:06,491
- It's happening to D-Rock,
he's changing so much.

221
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:08,491
- He is, I just watched
it right here, he's very

222
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:10,023
condescending, the way he stares at me.

223
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:12,660
(laughter)

224
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,946
- So you were really trying to be careful.

225
00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:17,455
- Yeah and so I had to ask
myself some very serious

226
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:18,729
questions.

227
00:09:18,729 --> 00:09:19,896
Why am I doing this?

228
00:09:19,896 --> 00:09:21,963
It's very important to
know if you want to end up

229
00:09:21,963 --> 00:09:23,493
somewhere, you have to know
where you want to end up.

230
00:09:23,493 --> 00:09:25,226
Then you have to have a compass
of knowing how to navigate.

231
00:09:25,226 --> 00:09:27,930
So for me I was at an artist, or famous.

232
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,552
I knew I wanted to be an
artist, nothing against fame, by

233
00:09:30,552 --> 00:09:32,408
the way, it's just which one
do you want as an experience

234
00:09:32,408 --> 00:09:33,551
for your life.

235
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:35,671
I wanted to be an artist,
so everyday I made decisions

236
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:37,756
based on being an artist,
not being famous or rich.

237
00:09:37,756 --> 00:09:39,685
- And that's that.

238
00:09:39,685 --> 00:09:42,245
- And the other kind of
interesting caveat is that I was

239
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:44,427
offered a million dollar
signing bonus and I turned it

240
00:09:44,427 --> 00:09:45,616
down.

241
00:09:45,616 --> 00:09:48,074
I read a book called everything
you need to know about

242
00:09:48,074 --> 00:09:49,830
the music business, and I
learned that it was an advance,

243
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,708
and that you owed the advance back.

244
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,495
I knew I was gonna make a
folk record, at the height of

245
00:09:53,495 --> 00:09:56,264
grunge, and I knew that the
odds of that working were

246
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:57,565
incredibly slim.

247
00:09:57,565 --> 00:09:59,760
And so I basically bought
my own right to make my own

248
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,594
music and I negotiated the
biggest backend anybody had

249
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:05,051
ever been given in
royalties and mechanicals.

250
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:06,311
- Same thing I did with Crush It.

251
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:07,311
- Nice I love it.

252
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:08,798
- I didn't want, that's so funny.

253
00:10:08,798 --> 00:10:11,888
- Yeah bet on yourself
- 100% if you're good enough

254
00:10:11,888 --> 00:10:13,434
bet on yourself.

255
00:10:13,434 --> 00:10:14,481
- Yeah.

256
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,352
And I turned down reality tv
shows and a lot of shortcut

257
00:10:16,352 --> 00:10:18,426
things, but there's no
shortcut to being great.

258
00:10:18,426 --> 00:10:21,354
So I did 600, 700 shows a year
and I did it for years and

259
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,952
I grinded it out and
ended up breaking through.

260
00:10:23,952 --> 00:10:26,832
But yes, I've always looked
at myself entrepreneurially.

261
00:10:26,832 --> 00:10:29,397
To answer your question in
a really round about way.

262
00:10:29,397 --> 00:10:30,852
- It's true, it's great,
it's really great.

263
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:32,852
(music)

264
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:40,884
- Tim you said something
earlier about, you know, you've

265
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:44,448
gotta be right to be able to
do the right thing by others.

266
00:10:44,448 --> 00:10:45,595
- Yeah.

267
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:48,442
- I, you know, it was interesting,
and you know this, this

268
00:10:48,442 --> 00:10:53,349
is, we have an interesting,
great, long relationship, but

269
00:10:53,349 --> 00:10:55,256
I really want to use this medium to

270
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:56,845
publicly apologize to you.

271
00:10:56,845 --> 00:10:58,425
This is something I've done to you

272
00:10:58,425 --> 00:10:59,659
personally a lot of times.

273
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,049
I am so thankful for the life that I live.

274
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:07,832
I am such a happy man because
I like really have like

275
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:09,796
crazy good intent, and have
been able to execute it a bunch.

276
00:11:09,796 --> 00:11:12,796
This is something nobody knows here,

277
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:16,452
I'm excited for everybody,
Tyler, and people that know who

278
00:11:16,452 --> 00:11:18,295
I am, and I know that you know who I am.

279
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:20,454
But I wanted to do it because
I thought it was important

280
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:23,384
for me because I want you to
know how much it means to me.

281
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:25,903
Because I've done it a
bunch of times personally.

282
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:28,019
Early in my career, I
was giving a speech at

283
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:31,269
Blogs with Balls, just funny, so.

284
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:35,566
I think I got overzealous,
I did get overzealous and I

285
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:38,512
was talking about hard work and hustle.

286
00:11:38,512 --> 00:11:42,519
And in it, I said, fuck four
hour work weeks, you gotta

287
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,065
work your ass off.

288
00:11:44,065 --> 00:11:47,342
And the level of intent was
extremely low, but in reality

289
00:11:47,342 --> 00:11:51,120
it was just not the right
thing to do, especially because

290
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,361
out of all the people I know on Earth.

291
00:11:53,361 --> 00:11:56,911
The thought that I haven't
offended or hurt or even did

292
00:11:56,911 --> 00:11:58,735
anything slightly wrong to
millions of people that I have

293
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:03,664
no respect for or compassion
for or desire for friendship

294
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:05,738
or how I feel about them.

295
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:10,404
The thought that that happened,
and I just want you to know

296
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:13,686
and I know I've said it a bunch
of times privately, but in

297
00:12:13,686 --> 00:12:17,512
my everlasting quest for you
to know how deeply I'm hurt

298
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:20,704
that I could've done anything
that hurt you or miffed you in

299
00:12:20,704 --> 00:12:25,374
any certain way, I wanted to
put it super out there into the

300
00:12:25,374 --> 00:12:27,477
universe and never let
there be any confusion.

301
00:12:27,477 --> 00:12:29,375
I admire you tremendously.

302
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:32,096
I've really enjoyed our
friendship through the years and

303
00:12:32,096 --> 00:12:34,704
that is, when I do die, that
is something that will still

304
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:35,998
run through my mind.

305
00:12:35,998 --> 00:12:37,782
I've lived it pretty good, and
have all the right intents.

306
00:12:37,782 --> 00:12:40,032
I hated that that happened.

307
00:12:41,248 --> 00:12:43,261
I hate that that happened.

308
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:45,645
And I want you to know on this
big of a stage or at least

309
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:48,045
on my micro big stage that I mean it

310
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:49,849
with every ounce of my soul.

311
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:51,008
- Thank you, Gary.

312
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:52,385
Accepted.

313
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:55,845
I know you do, we've talked
about it personally so.

314
00:12:55,845 --> 00:12:58,474
- But you mean a lot to me.

315
00:12:58,474 --> 00:12:59,642
- That means a lot so thank you

316
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:00,993
- I mean honestly like now
as I get older, there's not

317
00:13:00,993 --> 00:13:03,280
that many people doing it.

318
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,488
You know.

319
00:13:04,488 --> 00:13:08,834
The level of, I get put into
a lot of, a lot of people use

320
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:12,762
my name and associate it with other names,

321
00:13:12,762 --> 00:13:14,203
and I have no interest.

322
00:13:14,203 --> 00:13:17,754
But every time people are like
oh, on Twitter, or in real

323
00:13:17,754 --> 00:13:20,345
life when people are like I
like Tim and Gary, and every

324
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:23,579
time I'm associated with your
name, it means a lot to me.

325
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:24,900
- Thank you, Gary.

326
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,923
- You're welcome, brother.

327
00:13:25,923 --> 00:13:26,953
I love you.

328
00:13:26,953 --> 00:13:28,046
Good luck
- Many adventures ahead.

329
00:13:28,046 --> 00:13:29,532
- 100% much appreciated.

330
00:13:29,532 --> 00:13:31,532
(music)

331
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,234
- Talk to me about The Hawk, Aaron Pryor.

332
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,699
- The Hawk was one of the
baddest dudes ever dude.

333
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:42,846
- Baddest dude ever
- I'm a big big Aaron

334
00:13:42,846 --> 00:13:44,503
and they don't know who he is.

335
00:13:44,503 --> 00:13:45,833
- The Hawk was one of
the baddest dudes ever.

336
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,235
- You're made you missed social
media, The Hawk missed it,

337
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:48,870
you know he just missed it.

338
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,164
- I know that's what I'm
saying, but God knows best, God

339
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,990
knows what he's doing, he
did it for his reasons, and

340
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,295
that's what we have to live with.

341
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:56,930
- I'm being selfish a couple more.

342
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:57,947
- But Hawk was a made boy.

343
00:13:57,947 --> 00:13:58,951
- John 'The Beast' Mugabe.

344
00:13:58,951 --> 00:13:59,946
- John 'The Beast'
Mugabe was a killer too.

345
00:13:59,946 --> 00:14:00,940
And Hacklett destroyed him
but he was a killer before

346
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,966
Hacklett destroyed him.

347
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:02,960
Yes.

348
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,978
- What about Terry Norris?

349
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:04,974
- Terry Norris was a very
good fighter, a very technical

350
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:07,645
fighter, I think he probably
did a little too much sparring

351
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:10,006
in his days because it
kinda got to him at the end.

352
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:12,316
But before that Terry was a bad boy.

353
00:14:12,316 --> 00:14:14,374
Terry could've played any
sport, boxing, basketball,

354
00:14:14,374 --> 00:14:15,748
football, anything.

355
00:14:15,748 --> 00:14:16,900
- Have you seen Nigel Benz' kid?

356
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,489
- Yes he's pretty good he's strong.

357
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:19,596
- He looks strong.

358
00:14:19,596 --> 00:14:20,844
- He's strong, he don't have
the technique his dad had

359
00:14:20,844 --> 00:14:22,417
yet, but he's very strong
so they keep working on him

360
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,136
technically, he could be a good fighter.

361
00:14:24,136 --> 00:14:25,435
Eubanks' kid is even better.

362
00:14:25,435 --> 00:14:27,344
- Yeah Eubanks' kid is

363
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:28,615
- Eubanks' kid is awesome.

364
00:14:28,615 --> 00:14:30,024
- Eubanks was some puncher, huh?

365
00:14:30,024 --> 00:14:31,291
- His son is awesome, yes.

366
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,296
- Interesting.

367
00:14:32,296 --> 00:14:34,153
- They both throw punches, and
both their kids are punchers.

368
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:35,382
- I know it's interesting like that.

369
00:14:35,382 --> 00:14:36,940
Julian Jackson.

370
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,857
- The Hawk.

371
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,456
His kid isn't trying to be what
he was, but he was a beast.

372
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:45,081
A menace.

373
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:46,735
- You guys want to see real knockouts.

374
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:48,002
- Real knockouts.

375
00:14:48,002 --> 00:14:50,848
- That knockout on Terry
Norris is so vicious.

376
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,669
- [Commentator] The incredible
knockout ratio of Jackson.

377
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:55,449
And that's right there
Terry Norris is gone.

378
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:56,949
- That dude there.

379
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:01,218
- Julian Jackson, and he had
a flat top like Patrick Ewing.

380
00:15:01,218 --> 00:15:03,218
(music)

381
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:09,502
Real quick, what's the
best flip you've ever had.

382
00:15:09,502 --> 00:15:10,797
- The best one?

383
00:15:10,797 --> 00:15:12,889
- Like the biggest ROI,
like I bought this bike at a

384
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:15,633
garage sale for $40 and
I sold it for 6,900.

385
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:17,988
- Nah I didn't have one like that.

386
00:15:17,988 --> 00:15:19,692
- I get it I mean I made that
up, but like give me a real

387
00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:21,640
fucking good one.

388
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,807
- I found a Ferrari 348 Spider
in a guy's garage and was

389
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:28,156
able to flip that.

390
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:31,701
I bought it for 20,000 bucks
cuz it didn't run and was able

391
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:33,618
to flip it for 113,000.

392
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,987
- That was better than the example I gave.

393
00:15:36,987 --> 00:15:38,447
(laughter)

394
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:39,845
He's like no, no, like I was like.

395
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:41,991
And how much work and things
did you have to put into it?

396
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:43,816
- I put fresh gas in it and started it up.

397
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:45,468
- It started right up.

398
00:15:45,468 --> 00:15:48,025
- Yeah with fresh gas and a
battery, we were good to go.

399
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:49,777
- By the way I could so get
caught on that cuz I don't

400
00:15:49,777 --> 00:15:51,332
understand cars like.

401
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:53,283
By the way, that's really interesting.

402
00:15:53,283 --> 00:15:55,787
I don't know if you know this
but all these chotchkas, like

403
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:57,887
so many people that watch me I
pushed them to this 2017 flip

404
00:15:57,887 --> 00:15:58,720
challenge.

405
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:02,548
And it's interesting, I know
pop culture so I'm good at like

406
00:16:02,548 --> 00:16:05,978
buying advertising or TV
stuff, buying it, knowing it's

407
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:07,458
undervalued.

408
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,173
But so many of the people that
watch me have a little bit

409
00:16:10,173 --> 00:16:12,386
more handy skills like you
did, maybe not for bikes and

410
00:16:12,386 --> 00:16:14,968
cars, but whether it's electronics
or things of that nature,

411
00:16:14,968 --> 00:16:18,140
and hearing people on Twitter
and email and DMing me on

412
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:22,089
Instagram like I bought this
I-this, it didn't work, it

413
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:24,901
took me one minute it was
the battery then I flipped it

414
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,289
for that, it's amazing.

415
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:28,824
It's amazing when you have
a skill set to use that as

416
00:16:28,824 --> 00:16:30,055
an arbitrage.

417
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,047
- No it's really cool.

418
00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:33,047
(music)

419
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:40,778
- Every single day, I make
pretend that my mother, dad,

420
00:16:40,778 --> 00:16:44,109
sister, brother, wife
or children are killed.

421
00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:46,328
Now I know this is a very
different version of it.

422
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:47,523
(laughter)

423
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:49,102
I know you didn't expect that one.

424
00:16:49,102 --> 00:16:51,352
- You crazy son of a bitch.

425
00:16:52,201 --> 00:16:53,776
- I know it's a little different.

426
00:16:53,776 --> 00:16:56,167
- Yes they get stabbed in the
eye, and then they take out

427
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:57,380
the groin.

428
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,026
- Yes it's sometimes even in
detail, but I will tell you,

429
00:17:00,026 --> 00:17:03,545
it's very fleeting, it
usually happens within 20.

430
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:05,286
- Great that they're still being here.

431
00:17:05,286 --> 00:17:07,265
- But I promise you, I know
it's a little left field, it's

432
00:17:07,265 --> 00:17:10,755
insane what that perspective
does for me, and I feel it.

433
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:11,751
- Well it's contrast.

434
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:12,915
- And I feel it, and I feel it in my soul.

435
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:14,138
- Contrast works.

436
00:17:14,138 --> 00:17:17,165
- And it just makes every bad thing.

437
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:19,733
And by the way, I'm sure for
your business, when you're the

438
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:21,248
last line of defense.

439
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:24,007
You know how they say
occupation on the doctor form?

440
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:26,328
The last time I filled it
out I said firefighter.

441
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:28,098
Because that's what I
think I do for a living.

442
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:29,601
Like it's just problems.

443
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:32,321
Like when I get done with this
interview and I look at my

444
00:17:32,321 --> 00:17:33,481
phone, seven problems.

445
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:34,786
Seven fires to put out,
like that's what I do.

446
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:35,923
For me it's perspective.

447
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:38,130
Like I don't understand how
people don't get that there's

448
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,414
seven plus billion people, that
there's so many people that

449
00:17:40,414 --> 00:17:42,895
have it worse than you.

450
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,211
- Look if you live in this
country, I feed a hundred million

451
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:47,128
people a year, I care.

452
00:17:47,128 --> 00:17:49,934
But if you live in poverty in
this country, you're the one

453
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:51,865
percent, you're not the 99 percent.

454
00:17:51,865 --> 00:17:52,887
- I know.

455
00:17:52,887 --> 00:17:54,424
- Two thirds of the planet lives
on two dollars and 50 cents

456
00:17:54,424 --> 00:17:55,911
a day, 900 dollars a year.

457
00:17:55,911 --> 00:17:58,143
If you're making 18,000 a
year, I don't want you to make

458
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:01,460
18,000, but you gotta start
with gratitude that you're one

459
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,872
of the richest humans on Earth.

460
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:04,425
It doesn't feel like it but you are.

461
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:06,425
(music)

462
00:18:10,268 --> 00:18:12,239
- Happiness, man, it's
just about happiness, bro.

463
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:14,035
That's all that matters,
is your happiness.

464
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:16,827
Other people are gonna tell
you what they think you should

465
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:19,321
do, or what they would do if
they were you, but they're not

466
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:21,068
you, bro, they're not you.

467
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:22,861
So just be happy, do what you
love, stay passionate, you

468
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:25,600
know, be smart and have
fun, and take risk.

469
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,417
- And be a Wuzzle.

470
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:29,037
Wuzzle was a 1984 cartoon
where two animals were in one

471
00:18:29,037 --> 00:18:29,870
animal.

472
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:33,175
Be a professional lacrosse
player and a fucking doctor.

473
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:36,641
And grandma fucking Victor is thrilled.

474
00:18:36,641 --> 00:18:38,607
- Swag, I love how we're talking
to 14 year old kids today

475
00:18:38,607 --> 00:18:40,183
it's awesome.

476
00:18:40,183 --> 00:18:43,658
- [Phone] Yeah I mean I like,
if you look at lacrosse,

477
00:18:43,658 --> 00:18:46,419
lacrosse is growing like
disgustingly fast and that's

478
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:48,665
- Dude I'm 41 and lacrosse
has been growing disgustingly

479
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:51,799
fast since I was 14 so be
careful, but it doesn't matter

480
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,554
be happy and execute on your thing.

481
00:18:53,554 --> 00:18:56,320
Don't justify your
dreams, execute on them.

482
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,153
Ooh.

483
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,668
- Yo put that shit on a shirt, bro.

484
00:19:00,668 --> 00:19:02,596
- That's actually what 'ooh' was.

485
00:19:02,596 --> 00:19:05,406
Alright Victor, we gotta go
my man, we wish you well.

486
00:19:05,406 --> 00:19:08,475
- [Phone] Alright, see ya, thanks logic.

487
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:09,308
- Peace

488
00:19:10,173 --> 00:19:11,168
- Alright one more.

489
00:19:11,168 --> 00:19:12,257
- Damn that was crucial.

490
00:19:12,257 --> 00:19:13,274
- Yeah don't just like

491
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:14,278
- Damn

492
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,275
this is tight.

493
00:19:15,275 --> 00:19:16,271
- This is fun right?

494
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:17,265
- This is cool as shit.

495
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:18,267
- I'm gonna see like 'Ask
Logic' in a couple weeks on

496
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:19,280
YouTube, you should do this man.

497
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,276
- Yeah it's fun

498
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:21,273
- It's fun right?

499
00:19:21,273 --> 00:19:22,406
- Yeah this dope, thank you.

500
00:19:22,406 --> 00:19:24,002
This is a really good experience.

501
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:26,265
- And so a good way to
scale interaction with fans.

502
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,673
- I like this energy.

503
00:19:27,673 --> 00:19:30,130
- Do you think we should
start a morning show?

504
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,942
Like me and you versus
like Kelly and Michael.

505
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:34,016
I guess they like

506
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:35,140
- That'd be great.

507
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,275
- You said you wanted to do TV.

508
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,267
- I'll wear the dress.

509
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:38,273
- I'll wear it too, we'll both wear it.

510
00:19:38,273 --> 00:19:39,543
- Alright.

511
00:19:39,543 --> 00:19:41,228
- Here we go.

512
00:19:41,228 --> 00:19:44,485
- You know the person's
name, or you didn't catch it.

513
00:19:44,485 --> 00:19:46,091
- Lafonda.

514
00:19:46,091 --> 00:19:48,403
- Lafonda you're on the Ask Gary Vee show.

515
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:49,486
- What is it?

516
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,905
- Alright we'll get it.

517
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:54,671
Alright relax over there guys.

518
00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:56,235
Sticking phones in each other's pockets.

519
00:19:56,235 --> 00:19:57,470
- [Phone] Hello?

520
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,851
- Yo this is Gary Vee you're
on the Ask Gary Vee show.

521
00:19:58,851 --> 00:19:59,768
With Logic.

522
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:04,832
(call dropped noise)

523
00:20:04,832 --> 00:20:06,564
(laughter)

524
00:20:06,564 --> 00:20:08,496
- They got scared, they were
like you could hear us in

525
00:20:08,496 --> 00:20:10,066
the background they got excited.

526
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:12,066
(music)

527
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,639
- T-Pain, you get to ask
the question of the day.

528
00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:20,792
Everyone who comes on as a
guest gets to ask the Veener

529
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:23,005
nation the question of the day.

530
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:24,720
This is an opportunity for
you to get market research or

531
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,598
curiosity of something answered.

532
00:20:26,598 --> 00:20:28,635
Thousands of comments and
answers will show up on YouTube.

533
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:30,492
And Facebook.

534
00:20:30,492 --> 00:20:32,056
- I got a question that's
got nothing to do with

535
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:33,081
what's going on.

536
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:34,104
- That's exactly what
I thought would happen.

537
00:20:34,104 --> 00:20:35,099
(laughter)

538
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:36,095
- Fire it away, T-Pain.

539
00:20:36,095 --> 00:20:37,101
- Okay.

540
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:38,093
I've been asking this question
all around the world and I

541
00:20:38,093 --> 00:20:40,963
will keep asking this question
until Neil DeGrasse Tyson

542
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:43,954
answers this goddamn question.

543
00:20:43,954 --> 00:20:47,371
If we go back in time, follow me on this.

544
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:50,103
(laughter)

545
00:20:50,103 --> 00:20:51,142
- Let me get settled in.

546
00:20:51,142 --> 00:20:52,261
- Right.

547
00:20:52,261 --> 00:20:55,021
If we go back in time, we know
the Earth moves through the

548
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:57,148
universe right, so the Earth
is moving, continuously.

549
00:20:57,148 --> 00:20:59,082
If we go back in time.

550
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:00,906
- I failed science

551
00:21:00,906 --> 00:21:03,785
- Do we go back to where the
Earth was at that time, and

552
00:21:03,785 --> 00:21:06,600
we just, that's why, I
think this is why we don't

553
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,597
- Okay when did this
question come to your head.

554
00:21:08,597 --> 00:21:10,127
- So, so long ago.

555
00:21:10,127 --> 00:21:11,139
- I can feel that.

556
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:12,670
(laughter)

557
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,444
- When, no
- Because the Earth

558
00:21:14,444 --> 00:21:17,246
- T-Pain! No, no when
- Moves through the Universe

559
00:21:17,246 --> 00:21:18,506
- When and why.

560
00:21:18,506 --> 00:21:19,673
- Time travel.

561
00:21:20,638 --> 00:21:22,998
Have you guys not been
thinking about time travel?

562
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:23,831
- Jake?

563
00:21:24,762 --> 00:21:26,845
(laughs)

564
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:30,233
- So if we're moving,

565
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:32,541
- I have never

566
00:21:33,465 --> 00:21:35,359
- If we're always moving through time.

567
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,767
- Thought about time
travel until this moment.

568
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:37,989
- If we're always moving
through time and space, and we

569
00:21:37,989 --> 00:21:40,444
go back in time, do we go
back to where the Earth was?

570
00:21:40,444 --> 00:21:42,468
That's why you don't see
time travelers, because they

571
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,827
just end up in a fucking void, somewhere.

572
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:46,515
- Oh wait a minute that was
actually interesting are you

573
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:48,036
telling me that I could go
back in time and stay alive

574
00:21:48,036 --> 00:21:50,869
longer, I'm just living in 1437.

575
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:52,163
- No.

576
00:21:52,163 --> 00:21:53,575
- Okay what are you saying.

577
00:21:53,575 --> 00:21:56,513
- I'm saying that if the
Earth is moving through the

578
00:21:56,513 --> 00:21:59,289
Universe, when you go back in time.

579
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:02,233
- Wait can we establish the
when you go back in time.

580
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:05,713
Who's gone back in time, how
have they gone back in time.

581
00:22:05,713 --> 00:22:07,304
- There are time machines.

582
00:22:07,304 --> 00:22:08,964
- Where.

583
00:22:08,964 --> 00:22:12,395
- They're in the fucking void
where the Earth used to be.

584
00:22:12,395 --> 00:22:16,508
They went back in time and
obviously died like in the void

585
00:22:16,508 --> 00:22:18,552
of space it's like fucking

586
00:22:18,552 --> 00:22:20,917
Arnold Schwarzenegger on total recall.

587
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:22,965
Head blew up, it's crazy,
there's a lot going on.

588
00:22:22,965 --> 00:22:24,578
I got footage, I don't have footage.

589
00:22:24,578 --> 00:22:26,390
(laughter)

590
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,327
So if the Earth is moving
through the Universe, when you

591
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:30,469
go back in time do you go
back to where the Earth was or

592
00:22:30,469 --> 00:22:32,162
does the Earth go back with you.

593
00:22:32,162 --> 00:22:33,479
- I don't know if I've ever
been more curious to see the

594
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:34,872
answers on YouTube and Facebook for this .

595
00:22:34,872 --> 00:22:35,905
T-Pain
- I'm ready I'm so ready.

596
00:22:35,905 --> 00:22:37,006
- I appreciate this

597
00:22:37,006 --> 00:22:38,590
- Absolutely.
- Album dropping November 17th

598
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,601
- That's some quantum shit I just dropped.

599
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:41,599
- You did.

600
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,595
You're the science
professor up in this bitch.

601
00:22:42,595 --> 00:00:00,000
(music)
