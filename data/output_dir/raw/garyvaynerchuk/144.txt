1
00:00:00,318 --> 00:00:02,370
- I'm fucking working around here.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,787
(rock music)

3
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:09,072
- [Driver] Good morning.
- Morning.

4
00:00:09,072 --> 00:00:10,905
- [Kyle] Good morning.

5
00:00:15,758 --> 00:00:17,983
- Good morning vlog, seven a.m.,

6
00:00:17,983 --> 00:00:21,645
headed to Jersey for a
two hour client meeting

7
00:00:21,645 --> 00:00:22,626
and heading back to the city.

8
00:00:22,626 --> 00:00:25,478
All day meetings till about 10 p.m.

9
00:00:25,478 --> 00:00:27,493
Last night I went to Cleveland.

10
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:31,660
I had a great time at the
Cavs game, Cavs, Celtics.

11
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:33,879
Big shout-out to Gordon Hayward.

12
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:35,472
I'm so sorry about your injury man.

13
00:00:35,472 --> 00:00:37,431
I hope you get better.

14
00:00:37,431 --> 00:00:39,153
It was super-gruesome.

15
00:00:39,153 --> 00:00:39,986
You saw that Kyle?

16
00:00:39,986 --> 00:00:40,819
- [Kyle] Yeah.

17
00:00:40,819 --> 00:00:42,527
- Yeah, wild.

18
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:43,838
Big love to everybody.

19
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:45,877
I hope everybody has a
great productive day.

20
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:47,084
It's gonna be another grinder.

21
00:00:47,084 --> 00:00:49,147
Just kinda how it is.

22
00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:52,990
Day in the life, most
of them aren't pretty.

23
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,573
(mellow music)

24
00:01:47,922 --> 00:01:50,203
- [Kyle] I thought that's
just super-fascinating.

25
00:01:50,203 --> 00:01:51,476
- That is interesting.

26
00:01:51,476 --> 00:01:54,132
That's actually exactly right.

27
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:55,654
The context.

28
00:01:55,654 --> 00:01:57,544
- [Kyle] How was the workout this morning?

29
00:01:57,544 --> 00:02:00,197
- Good, I got home late last
night since I was in Cleveland

30
00:02:00,197 --> 00:02:04,058
so it was mainly low rolling
session this morning but good.

31
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:05,418
- [Kyle] How many days a
week do you usually go?

32
00:02:05,418 --> 00:02:06,369
- Every.

33
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:07,404
- [Kyle] Everyday?

34
00:02:07,404 --> 00:02:10,571
- Workout everyday, seven days a week.

35
00:02:11,525 --> 00:02:12,976
- [Kyle] Do you like
going seven days a week?

36
00:02:12,976 --> 00:02:14,096
Like to you feel pumped in the morning?

37
00:02:14,096 --> 00:02:14,965
- Yeah, I like to,

38
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:17,473
I just need to not break
the pattern, you know?

39
00:02:17,473 --> 00:02:18,767
- [Kyle] Yeah.

40
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:20,278
- Even if it's a day like today.

41
00:02:20,278 --> 00:02:22,861
(mellow music)

42
00:02:30,662 --> 00:02:31,495
Love this.

43
00:02:33,225 --> 00:02:36,975
Love the green, love
this, love the cork top.

44
00:02:39,532 --> 00:02:41,865
Inside, these are super rad.

45
00:02:45,142 --> 00:02:46,620
What do you think Kyle,
you gonna get a pair?

46
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,951
- [Kyle] Of course.

47
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:48,838
- Yes!

48
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:51,887
Accidents, traffic, I hate
being late for meetings

49
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:54,720
but some things you can't control.

50
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,182
(mellow music)

51
00:03:00,478 --> 00:03:01,561
Meeting time.

52
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:05,662
Please don't film here.

53
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:09,297
I can fit one, two.

54
00:03:09,297 --> 00:03:10,799
I can fit two.

55
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,382
Okay, that was fun.

56
00:03:16,703 --> 00:03:18,620
Do you want a seatbelt?

57
00:03:19,915 --> 00:03:21,212
Jeff, are you wearing a seatbelt?

58
00:03:21,212 --> 00:03:22,045
- [Jeff] Of course.

59
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:22,878
- Thank you.

60
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:25,096
This is why this whole
thing's gonna work for us.

61
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:29,573
Every time somebody cares
about their money, we win.

62
00:03:29,573 --> 00:03:31,762
As I embark on my fifth business book

63
00:03:31,762 --> 00:03:33,940
and because five is my favorite number,

64
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,222
I just want to make sure
I acknowledge the team,

65
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:39,401
the thing, that I most value in the world,

66
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:41,076
which is my family.

67
00:03:41,076 --> 00:03:42,742
From my amazing wife Lizzie,

68
00:03:42,742 --> 00:03:45,561
and my amazing kids Misha and Xander,

69
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:48,970
to my unbelievable
parents, Sasha and Tamara,

70
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,074
and the rest of my siblings and in-laws

71
00:03:52,074 --> 00:03:54,657
and brother and sister in-laws.

72
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:59,405
I'm only able to live this anomaly

73
00:04:01,963 --> 00:04:03,575
because of the infrastructure and the love

74
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:05,167
that you guys support me with.

75
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:07,183
And so I thank you from
the bottom of my heart.

76
00:04:07,183 --> 00:04:08,467
And this is dedicated to all the people

77
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:11,329
that are brave enough to attempt

78
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:15,061
the ability to go out and live their life

79
00:04:15,061 --> 00:04:19,228
and actually recognize the
enormous opportunity we all have

80
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:24,391
in this new digital age to
have a balance of happiness,

81
00:04:25,402 --> 00:04:28,902
not only in their life, but in their work.

82
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,023
Cool.

83
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:35,292
(gentle music)

84
00:04:37,204 --> 00:04:38,457
Kyle, you're not getting much.

85
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:39,839
It's just been meeting after meeting.

86
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,142
Just keep B-rolling the
fuck out of this vlog.

87
00:04:42,142 --> 00:04:43,181
I'll figure out how to make this

88
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:44,301
an entertaining episode for you

89
00:04:44,301 --> 00:04:46,225
but I'm fucking working around here.

90
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:48,808
(mellow music)

91
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:55,975
(upbeat music)

92
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:10,354
What's up vlog?

93
00:05:10,354 --> 00:05:13,039
As you could tell by the B-roll
that Kyle's gonna bang out,

94
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,818
today was an obnoxiously busy day.

95
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:16,166
I did a bunch of 90 day reviews.

96
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,529
Every 90 days I get
together with my, Anna!

97
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:19,362
Hi!

98
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,160
- [Anna] How are you?

99
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,545
- Vlog, this is Anna, one of
my favorite, favorite employees

100
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:26,902
at VaynerMedia, six years?

101
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:29,781
- Hello, six, five
years, five years, yeah.

102
00:05:29,781 --> 00:05:30,852
- Five, five, feels like six.

103
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:31,685
- I just came from gym guys.

104
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:33,064
- Do you think it's weird
that you'll be on the vlog

105
00:05:33,064 --> 00:05:34,486
in your kind of gym, red faced out.

106
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:36,287
- I'm just out of gym
class, like two seconds.

107
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:37,388
- Did you kill it?
- Yeah.

108
00:05:37,388 --> 00:05:38,585
- [Reeva] It felt good.
- Hi.

109
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:39,418
- This is Reva.
- Hi, Reva.

110
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:40,568
- Reva, how are you?

111
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:41,401
- Good nice to meet ya.

112
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:42,234
- Pleasure, good to see you.

113
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:43,301
You well?
- Yeah

114
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,165
- Are you gonna ever say hi to me or?

115
00:05:44,165 --> 00:05:44,998
- Yeah.

116
00:05:44,998 --> 00:05:45,901
- This is my open door policy issue

117
00:05:45,901 --> 00:05:47,315
that I've been talking about.

118
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:48,849
I need to see you more often.

119
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:49,836
- Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

120
00:05:49,836 --> 00:05:50,846
- You always promise and you never do.

121
00:05:50,846 --> 00:05:52,628
- Well I'm still mad.

122
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:53,474
- Please, you good?
- Yeah.

123
00:05:53,474 --> 00:05:54,307
- All well?
- Yeah.

124
00:05:54,307 --> 00:05:56,587
- Good, awesome.
- Alright, bye.

125
00:05:56,587 --> 00:05:57,762
- Yes?

126
00:05:57,762 --> 00:05:58,899
- Oh bro!
- How are you?

127
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,228
- I love listening to your stuff, man.

128
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:01,061
- Thank you brother.

129
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:01,979
- Can I get a quick picture?

130
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,018
- Of course.

131
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:04,080
Love it man.

132
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,913
What's your name?

133
00:06:04,913 --> 00:06:06,077
- Steve man.
- Steve thanks for the love.

134
00:06:06,077 --> 00:06:08,630
- Thank you so much for
posting everything you post

135
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,641
and all the things you say.

136
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:10,474
- Thank you brother.

137
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:12,017
I wish you well.

138
00:06:12,017 --> 00:06:13,100
Okay, got it.

139
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,475
So busy day, all day.

140
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:17,915
Every 90 days I get together with my team,

141
00:06:17,915 --> 00:06:18,748
da, da, da, da, da.

142
00:06:18,748 --> 00:06:21,680
Lots of stuff, client
stuff, great day, super-busy

143
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,421
and so what I want to do

144
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:25,004
is I want to set up this talk I gave

145
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:28,061
at Bloomberg for Cornell Tech.

146
00:06:28,061 --> 00:06:29,368
Very much the state of the union

147
00:06:29,368 --> 00:06:30,610
of a lot of thoughts on my mind.

148
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,266
A lot of things that are
going on with the tech space,

149
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:37,885
the entrepreneur space, the
attention of consumer space,

150
00:06:37,885 --> 00:06:39,240
engaging with your employees, Anna,

151
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,926
engaging with people that are
consuming your content, Steve.

152
00:06:42,926 --> 00:06:44,723
I'm mean just super-interesting stuff.

153
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:45,862
I hope you enjoy it.

154
00:06:45,862 --> 00:06:49,877
One of the sharper kind of
different angled fireside chats

155
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:51,888
that I've done in a while

156
00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:53,712
and I hope you sit back,

157
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:56,816
pop a glass of red wine and watch this.

158
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:57,649
- Gary.
- Yes?

159
00:06:57,649 --> 00:06:58,592
- Very straightforward,

160
00:06:58,592 --> 00:07:01,833
let's start with
uncovering your strengths.

161
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,892
Lots of people want to be
Gary Vee, but they can't.

162
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:08,621
So let's talk about self
awareness and when you figured out

163
00:07:08,621 --> 00:07:12,038
that you are an exceptional communicator.

164
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:15,908
- You know, not until later.

165
00:07:15,908 --> 00:07:18,209
I think it's funny, lots of
people want to be Gary Vee.

166
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:22,678
I think lots of people want to
really figure themselves out

167
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:25,266
and put them in a position
to be happy and successful.

168
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:26,099
So when I hear that,

169
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:27,724
I mean I don't think a lot
of people want to be me.

170
00:07:27,724 --> 00:07:29,625
I think I put myself really out there

171
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,226
and a lot of baggage comes along with that

172
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:33,440
and so I think
personalities are different.

173
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,607
But it's interesting to think
about your circumstances.

174
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:40,218
I was 31 years old running

175
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:43,565
a retail e-commerce wine
business in New Jersey.

176
00:07:43,565 --> 00:07:45,731
I'd never been to Silicon Valley.

177
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:48,209
A lot has happened very quickly

178
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:52,260
on the back of me understanding
where consumer tension is.

179
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,525
And probably about a year
into Wine Library TV,

180
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:59,104
in 2006 I started a wine
video blog show around wine

181
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:02,091
on YouTube in YouTube's really early days

182
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:04,176
and about six months in I'm like wow,

183
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:05,968
a lot of people are watching this

184
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:09,122
and it was because I
was talking about wine

185
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,776
in a very different way

186
00:08:10,776 --> 00:08:13,274
and I genuinely believe
a lot of entrepreneurs

187
00:08:13,274 --> 00:08:15,824
and people listen to me because

188
00:08:15,824 --> 00:08:18,562
I think I'm undereducated in some ways.

189
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:20,356
You know I don't know the way a lot

190
00:08:20,356 --> 00:08:21,625
of things are said or done,

191
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,591
because I was very much a street
immigrant kind of kid more.

192
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:25,528
I wasn't a good student

193
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:28,458
and I just kind of look at things

194
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,617
a lot of times for the first time, right?

195
00:08:30,617 --> 00:08:32,509
And I think someway, somehow,

196
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:36,676
and because my Mom's Dad
basically only spoke in analogies

197
00:08:38,486 --> 00:08:40,361
from what my Mom talks about him

198
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:41,569
and I do that quite a bit.

199
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,276
I feel like, you know my Dad doesn't talk.

200
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:46,726
- What do you mean he doesn't talk?

201
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,147
- So my Dad and I drove
45 minutes to Wine Library

202
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:51,179
and back when I was a teen.

203
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:54,110
Shoppers Discount Liquors back in the day.

204
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,504
I lived in Hunterdon County, New Jersey

205
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:56,464
for my high school years

206
00:08:56,464 --> 00:08:59,090
and my Dad's wine store was
in Short Hills, Millburn,

207
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,017
so it was 45 minutes
on Route 78 in Jersey.

208
00:09:01,017 --> 00:09:04,027
And we would drive all the
way there and all the way back

209
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:06,596
and I talked every minute
and my Dad didn't say a word.

210
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:07,614
(audience laughs)

211
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,294
So my Dad's an old-school Russian guy.

212
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:10,771
You know in Russia, Communist Russia,

213
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:12,380
you didn't talk because
if you said something

214
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,891
that somebody found out, you went to jail.

215
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:15,625
I mean like let's get to the punch line.

216
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,461
There's a lot of reasons
my Dad doesn't talk.

217
00:09:18,461 --> 00:09:21,628
But yeah, being in a setting like that

218
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:24,462
where you're building something

219
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:26,218
in a business environment together

220
00:09:26,218 --> 00:09:28,806
but somebody's not
communicating back to you

221
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:30,406
definitely honed, I think,

222
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:32,334
intuitive skills I already had,

223
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:34,015
improv skills I already had.

224
00:09:34,015 --> 00:09:37,265
They probably made them hyper and yeah.

225
00:09:39,334 --> 00:09:42,078
At this point I really understand it

226
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:44,624
but I'm really bad at cheering
things or observing them.

227
00:09:44,624 --> 00:09:45,995
Like I do them in real time.

228
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:47,398
There was never a point where I sat down

229
00:09:47,398 --> 00:09:49,106
and thoughtfully was like wow,

230
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:50,720
I have this or this is important.

231
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,044
I'm aware of it.

232
00:09:52,044 --> 00:09:53,535
I try not to get too high or too low

233
00:09:53,535 --> 00:09:54,368
about any of these things,

234
00:09:54,368 --> 00:09:59,122
but it's definitely a
disproportionate impact on my career,

235
00:09:59,122 --> 00:10:01,944
but not only as the public persona,

236
00:10:01,944 --> 00:10:04,948
on the one-to-one relationships
I have with my employees

237
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:07,310
and my family members.

238
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,477
Being a good communicator is
a pretty fruitful skill set.

239
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:14,558
- And as Dan was saying,
you learn by doing

240
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:17,195
and you've formed multiple businesses.

241
00:10:17,195 --> 00:10:20,139
This communications skill
has allowed you to do this

242
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:21,934
from Wine Library, to VaynerSports,

243
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:25,027
to the host of multiple digital programs.

244
00:10:25,027 --> 00:10:26,373
Which of these different businesses

245
00:10:26,373 --> 00:10:30,016
do you do for love versus for money?

246
00:10:30,016 --> 00:10:31,531
- I speak for love.

247
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:32,903
I do this for love.

248
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:36,086
Like this is the place I love the most.

249
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:39,874
Public speaking is now an
ROI negative event for me

250
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:41,744
with the things that
are going on in my life,

251
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:44,021
even though it is still crazy to me

252
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:45,985
what I get paid to do a speech.

253
00:10:45,985 --> 00:10:49,003
You know, especially when you
come from zero, it's you know.

254
00:10:49,003 --> 00:10:52,959
Getting paid to give a
speech one day this year,

255
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,128
making more money than I
made when I was 30 years old,

256
00:10:55,128 --> 00:10:57,029
is a pretty intense kind of thing

257
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:58,626
that you'd wrap your head around,

258
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:01,592
but it's still not worth my
time in a lot of ways now

259
00:11:01,592 --> 00:11:03,201
unless it's leading to business generation

260
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:04,694
for VaynerMedia or other things,

261
00:11:04,694 --> 00:11:06,699
which is really what I've now mainly do.

262
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:07,907
But I'll do something in New York

263
00:11:07,907 --> 00:11:10,377
or support organizations I believe in.

264
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:11,436
But I do this for love.

265
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:13,700
I love the thought that,

266
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,463
like so knowing all of,

267
00:11:15,463 --> 00:11:17,971
so I love reverse
engineering the audience.

268
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:21,063
So I'm in a very funny zone
right now in this talk.

269
00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:23,154
In this talk it's less
about entertainment,

270
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:25,874
like 18,000 people at a
off-site for a company.

271
00:11:25,874 --> 00:11:28,627
Tonight's about okay, I
really want to be sharp

272
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:30,292
and talk about three or
four things that I think

273
00:11:30,292 --> 00:11:32,417
even a really strong crowd like this

274
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:34,350
isn't thinking enough about,

275
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,889
because I'm always trying to
leave with giving more value

276
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:38,801
than the person expected, right?

277
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:40,634
So this I do for love.

278
00:11:42,437 --> 00:11:44,203
The Gary Vee thing, the public persona,

279
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,249
I think I do for love the most.

280
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,778
- Okay, VaynerSports?

281
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:51,905
- VaynerSports is a business
that is very interesting

282
00:11:51,905 --> 00:11:53,987
because my brother has Crohn's disease

283
00:11:53,987 --> 00:11:56,615
and so he left VaynerMedia two years ago

284
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,811
because the stress of
going from 30 to 800 people

285
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:00,923
was pretty intense and he
just didn't like it anymore.

286
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:02,552
And if anybody here is in client service,

287
00:12:02,552 --> 00:12:03,988
you're just managing people,

288
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:07,146
and if you don't like managing
people, it sucks shit, right?

289
00:12:07,146 --> 00:12:10,054
And so he got to that place
and he needed to bounce

290
00:12:10,054 --> 00:12:11,998
and he needed time for himself.

291
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,616
And very quickly he came back

292
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:15,433
and said "What about that
sports agency we bought?"

293
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:17,134
I bought a sports
agency, a very small one.

294
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:18,242
Just to learn, you know.

295
00:12:18,242 --> 00:12:21,374
I have very substantial ambitions
to buy the New York Jets.

296
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,020
(audience and host laughing)

297
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,132
So I figured if I own a
sports agency I'll learn.

298
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:26,333
I'll learn from the inside.

299
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,792
I was gonna lose money every year

300
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:29,299
owning a boutique sports agency

301
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:32,800
that I wasn't going to be
really involved with, to learn.

302
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,944
But then he wanted to do that

303
00:12:34,944 --> 00:12:36,860
and once he decided he
wanted to really be involved,

304
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,261
I felt comfortable in
rebranding it to VaynerSports,

305
00:12:39,261 --> 00:12:40,313
putting our name on it.

306
00:12:40,313 --> 00:12:41,498
It was gonna be real.

307
00:12:41,498 --> 00:12:42,833
I love it.

308
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:47,000
I mean I'm talking to 50 of
the top 100 football players

309
00:12:48,014 --> 00:12:51,180
that are gonna come into the
NFL next year on DM right now.

310
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,359
It's fun, I like it.

311
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:53,192
It's interesting.

312
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:55,247
It's an awful business, makes no sense.

313
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:56,665
It's the stupidest business going.

314
00:12:56,665 --> 00:12:59,568
Like just a terrible business
model, sports agencies.

315
00:12:59,568 --> 00:13:00,700
You have to have unbelievable scale

316
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,991
for it even to become
somewhat interesting.

317
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,169
My brother's doing it for love.

318
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:09,356
I'm doing it for the love of my brother.

319
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:11,049
- Now your philosophy as you pursue

320
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:13,459
all these different avenues
is that nine to five,

321
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,260
working nine to five is for losers.

322
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,707
If you want to be productive (laughing).

323
00:13:16,707 --> 00:13:17,624
- Not true.

324
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:20,063
- Well it's for someone
who isn't gonna get

325
00:13:20,063 --> 00:13:21,930
where they want to get.

326
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,006
- No, and I appreciate you bringing it up.

327
00:13:24,006 --> 00:13:27,208
And listen, The Times razzed
me the other day on this

328
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,541
in a pretty substantial way.

329
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:33,011
When I talk about things, context is lost.

330
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:33,897
Sometimes I'm at fault,

331
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:36,277
sometimes people that
report on it are at fault.

332
00:13:36,277 --> 00:13:38,378
To make it very clear, here's my thing.

333
00:13:38,378 --> 00:13:41,370
I'm fascinated by people that complain.

334
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,287
If you don't complain,

335
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:44,776
I actually have nothing to say to you.

336
00:13:44,776 --> 00:13:46,940
I don't think I'm entitled to.

337
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,486
You clearly have no
reason to really listen.

338
00:13:48,486 --> 00:13:49,863
If you're good, you're good.

339
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:50,696
And if that's nine to five,

340
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,570
and you're on four softball teams,

341
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,438
and you're loving life, then you won.

342
00:13:55,438 --> 00:13:58,189
My big thing is in this
era of everybody saying

343
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:00,054
that they're gonna be billionaires
and they're entrepreneurs

344
00:14:00,054 --> 00:14:03,711
and they're the best and I'm
the next fucking Zucks, right?

345
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:05,305
And you're going to Coachella,

346
00:14:05,305 --> 00:14:07,795
and you're going to every Summit at Sea,

347
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:09,726
and you're just not working,

348
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:13,786
like you might think that's intriguing.

349
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,093
I don't think people are losers.

350
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:16,725
I don't think people shouldn't sleep.

351
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:18,400
I think you're actions

352
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,875
should match your mouth
and your ambitions.

353
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,362
That's what I'm interested in.

354
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,333
And I think that we have a
very broken system right now

355
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,830
of entrepreneurial tendencies
because there's a lot of money

356
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,931
in the system and it's
a very intriguing time.

357
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:36,764
So I think working nine
to five is for a loser

358
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:39,761
that says that they're
gonna rule the world

359
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:43,191
and they watch Netflix
for four hours a day.

360
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:45,002
- But if you want to
start your own business,

361
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:46,800
if you want to be the next Gary Vee,

362
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,290
it takes more than working nine to five.

363
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,277
You gotta put in the time,
you've got to hustle.

364
00:14:51,277 --> 00:14:52,110
- I think so.

365
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:57,061
I think it's super hard to build
a substantial, sustainable,

366
00:14:57,061 --> 00:15:00,228
safe business working nine to five if,

367
00:15:01,455 --> 00:15:02,448
I mean look, let me say it again,

368
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:03,673
you can work nine to five.

369
00:15:03,673 --> 00:15:05,110
You really can.

370
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,360
I just think that hard work

371
00:15:08,243 --> 00:15:11,303
is an unbelievably controllable variable

372
00:15:11,303 --> 00:15:14,287
compared to the serendipity
of the marketplace,

373
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:16,230
the God-given talent you have.

374
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,792
You see it's a very important variable

375
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,459
that I think is a differentiator

376
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:23,538
if you want to be successful

377
00:15:23,538 --> 00:15:25,958
and I see a lot of people
resting on their laurels

378
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,904
after they hit some success in their past.

379
00:15:28,904 --> 00:15:30,220
And what I'm worried about

380
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,267
is technology's created infrastructure

381
00:15:32,267 --> 00:15:36,174
that has not allowed us
to rest on our advantages,

382
00:15:36,174 --> 00:15:38,502
not even the biggest
companies in the world.

383
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:39,551
The biggest retailers in the world,

384
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:41,874
the biggest media companies
in the world, are on call.

385
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,783
You and your little
cockamamie business are good?

386
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:45,076
Get outta here.

387
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:48,008
And so like, you know, that's it.

388
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:50,244
- It's a differentiator but what happens

389
00:15:50,244 --> 00:15:52,965
for people who don't have
the time or the resources?

390
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:54,577
I mean I'm a working mom.

391
00:15:54,577 --> 00:15:56,498
How on earth am I
supposed to do my day job,

392
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,029
talk to you, get home,

393
00:15:58,029 --> 00:15:59,095
deal with my kids,

394
00:15:59,095 --> 00:16:01,161
make sure that they have
enough to eat for the next day,

395
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:04,551
prepare their lunch, and
then use my remaining hours

396
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:06,923
to come up with something
that I'm passionate about?

397
00:16:06,923 --> 00:16:08,831
- Well do you want to build a business?

398
00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:11,404
- It's not so, I'm saying
for whatever I pursue,

399
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:15,187
and yes, if that means going
down that road later on.

400
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:17,612
- So I just think life's
about options, right?

401
00:16:17,612 --> 00:16:19,645
Like everybody's got stuff.

402
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,559
Like to me the fact that
you even have the ability

403
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:24,769
to build a business between 9:30 p.m.

404
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:27,297
and one o'clock in the
morning is remarkable

405
00:16:27,297 --> 00:16:28,926
because your grandmother didn't.

406
00:16:28,926 --> 00:16:32,046
The internet has allowed that
to actually be even a debate.

407
00:16:32,046 --> 00:16:33,911
Our grandparents grew up in an environment

408
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:35,729
where that became (clapping).

409
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:36,562
You know, you weren't opening

410
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,056
a business at 9:30 p.m., right?

411
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:41,220
The fact that we even
have the ability even

412
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,160
to debate that is fascinating to me.

413
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,055
And I'm not naive that there
is extreme circumstances

414
00:16:47,055 --> 00:16:48,502
for many people and that people

415
00:16:48,502 --> 00:16:51,251
are starting further along than others.

416
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:54,989
My point on that has always
been it's just remarkable

417
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:56,178
that you can do so much

418
00:16:56,178 --> 00:16:58,256
between seven p.m and two in the morning

419
00:16:58,256 --> 00:17:01,104
to change the outcome
of your life, the end.

420
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,052
And that's it.

421
00:17:03,052 --> 00:17:06,595
I mean it's not super
difficult to understand.

422
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:10,143
It's the options that we are now awarded

423
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,599
by the infrastructure
of scalable technologies

424
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,629
that have no cost of entry
to build a personal brand

425
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,661
or a small business direct to consumer

426
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,560
is just fascinating to me.

427
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,413
You shouldn't, other people
have better advantages than you.

428
00:17:23,414 --> 00:17:26,357
You're also more than welcome
to take a different job,

429
00:17:26,357 --> 00:17:28,654
make less money, take a step back,

430
00:17:28,654 --> 00:17:30,239
live a little less fancy for four years

431
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:31,891
and build your business.

432
00:17:31,891 --> 00:17:34,600
The thing that we never
talk about is the step back.

433
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,206
A lot of people say to
me and they come at me

434
00:17:36,206 --> 00:17:37,892
and they're like "yeah,
but I got this and this"

435
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:39,808
and I'm like cool but if you're so upset

436
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,185
and you want to build this business,

437
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,538
why not go from making 180 a year to 97.

438
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:46,027
You've opened up a lot of time.

439
00:17:46,027 --> 00:17:48,352
Why don't you sell your home
and go rent an apartment.

440
00:17:48,352 --> 00:17:51,148
Why don't you go fucking not
buy four different outfits

441
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:53,696
every month and buy one a year.

442
00:17:53,696 --> 00:17:54,841
You can.

443
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,115
Life's about options.

444
00:17:56,115 --> 00:17:57,796
There's a lot of ways to do this.

445
00:17:57,796 --> 00:17:59,952
- [Scarlet] When was the
last time you stepped back?

446
00:17:59,952 --> 00:18:02,035
- VaynerMedia's a step back.

447
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:03,115
- [Scarlet] How?

448
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,543
- How?

449
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:06,942
Seven years ago, I'd just
come on the back of investing

450
00:18:06,942 --> 00:18:09,359
in Facebook, and Twitter, and Tumblr.

451
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,460
I was one of the 100 most
followed people on Twitter.

452
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,090
I had all sorts of opportunities.

453
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,976
I could have raised hundreds
of millions of dollars

454
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:18,414
for a fund on the back of being

455
00:18:18,414 --> 00:18:21,029
an early angel investor that was fancy.

456
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:22,271
I was rolling.

457
00:18:22,271 --> 00:18:24,052
I had a lot of things going for me.

458
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:26,990
And I decided to take a step
back and start VaynerMedia

459
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,702
because I thought it would
be an amazing infrastructure

460
00:18:29,702 --> 00:18:33,307
for me to build on top
of in my 50's and 60's.

461
00:18:33,307 --> 00:18:36,139
So I mean I make a lot less money

462
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:39,123
and eat a lot more shit
by running VaynerMedia

463
00:18:39,123 --> 00:18:39,956
than the options that were

464
00:18:39,956 --> 00:18:42,239
in front of me seven, eight years ago.

465
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:43,596
- [Scarlet] You took the boring approach.

466
00:18:43,596 --> 00:18:45,282
- I took an extremely boring approach

467
00:18:45,282 --> 00:18:48,995
that a lot of my friends that
are fancy still make fun of.

468
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:50,087
Definitely made fun of at the time.

469
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,651
Now a lot of them have
gone out of business

470
00:18:51,651 --> 00:18:53,094
so they make less fun.

471
00:18:53,094 --> 00:18:54,048
(audience and Scarlet laughing)

472
00:18:54,048 --> 00:18:56,393
And you know what, to be very frank,

473
00:18:56,393 --> 00:18:59,009
the Gary Vee thing started getting big

474
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:02,248
and I didn't like that I
was a motivational speaker.

475
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:05,302
I had so much pride that
as a 22 year old kid

476
00:19:05,302 --> 00:19:07,517
I took my Dad's business with no money

477
00:19:07,517 --> 00:19:11,327
and grew it substantially
at a very significant way

478
00:19:11,327 --> 00:19:13,260
and I thought of myself as a businessman,

479
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,218
not as this personality,

480
00:19:15,218 --> 00:19:17,318
or this new age motivational speaker,

481
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:19,354
so I think I even needed it for myself

482
00:19:19,354 --> 00:19:22,395
to build another business
to just scratch that itch

483
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,957
that I wasn't a charlatan
or a personality,

484
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:26,219
that I had chops,

485
00:19:26,219 --> 00:19:28,570
who just happened to be
a little narcissistic

486
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,403
and over the top.

487
00:19:29,403 --> 00:19:31,627
- (laughing) For those
who have figured out

488
00:19:31,627 --> 00:19:33,295
they're passionate, they
want to start a business,

489
00:19:33,295 --> 00:19:34,735
they're ready to take the leap.

490
00:19:34,735 --> 00:19:35,790
The question for a lot of them

491
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,695
is how do they tell that
story in a captivating way?

492
00:19:38,695 --> 00:19:40,748
How do they convince others
that that they're there

493
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:42,109
and they're the real thing.

494
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:43,741
- For the purpose of raising capital

495
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:45,101
or for the purpose of getting awareness?

496
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,498
- Both.

497
00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:49,048
- Well first you have to
figure out if you're capable.

498
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:52,132
Are you good enough at writing, audio,

499
00:19:52,132 --> 00:19:54,370
or video to communicate your story?

500
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,028
You have to find your medium first.

501
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,463
There's a lot of people
that can captivate.

502
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,789
Fred Wilson has built
a lot of brand equity

503
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:01,495
and a lot of deal flow through writing.

504
00:20:01,495 --> 00:20:02,328
Through writing.

505
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:05,080
I created it through video, right?

506
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,160
Joe Rogan and Tim Ferriss continue

507
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,542
to build it on audio, right?

508
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,837
So there's three ways to communicate.

509
00:20:10,837 --> 00:20:12,688
When you start getting
into cartooning and art

510
00:20:12,688 --> 00:20:13,930
you can go a little bit further

511
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,247
but there's three core ways.

512
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,911
There's written, audio, and video.

513
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:19,675
First and foremost you can't
be romantic about which one.

514
00:20:19,675 --> 00:20:23,072
A lot of people want to be
good at video or this and that.

515
00:20:23,072 --> 00:20:24,162
So A, you have to figure out

516
00:20:24,162 --> 00:20:25,451
if you can actually tell a story

517
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:27,034
and then two, you have
to figure out the medium

518
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:28,080
in which you can tell a story.

519
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,145
And if you can do it in
more than one places,

520
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,175
that would be preferable

521
00:20:31,175 --> 00:20:34,083
because our attention
is fragmented at scale.

522
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,265
So that's the strategy behind it.

523
00:20:36,265 --> 00:20:38,113
- [Scarlet] So how do you
decide which is the best medium

524
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:41,341
because there's different
things that come into fashion,

525
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,269
go out of fashion.

526
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:46,658
I mean if you pause too
long, you'll miss it.

527
00:20:46,658 --> 00:20:49,152
- My answer is to do them all.

528
00:20:49,152 --> 00:20:50,097
- [Scarlet] Hit it all?

529
00:20:50,097 --> 00:20:51,266
- If you can.

530
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:54,137
You know, look, I don't thing
people have really audited

531
00:20:54,137 --> 00:20:57,253
how much downtime they
have if they want it.

532
00:20:57,253 --> 00:20:59,192
I mean this all comes down to ambition.

533
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:01,595
Reverse engineering the actual ambition.

534
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:04,205
It's fine if you want to
pander in front of friends,

535
00:21:04,205 --> 00:21:06,302
or relatives, or other people.

536
00:21:06,302 --> 00:21:08,479
You need to really have a real
conversations with yourself

537
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:11,246
and you also need to realize
it's going to change.

538
00:21:11,246 --> 00:21:13,311
When you're 22, and you're single,

539
00:21:13,311 --> 00:21:15,658
and you're on fire, and your
older brother's killing it,

540
00:21:15,658 --> 00:21:17,617
and you want to fucking
prove it to your parents,

541
00:21:17,617 --> 00:21:18,711
and yourself, and this and that.

542
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,491
You get married, you fall
in love, you have a kid,

543
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:22,177
you have a sick kid, priorities change.

544
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:24,449
Life is life, a lot happens.

545
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,203
So not only do you have
to talk to yourself

546
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:27,884
and figure out what your ambition is,

547
00:21:27,884 --> 00:21:30,823
you have to actually audit
that on a daily basis.

548
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:33,878
At least at a monthly basis
and it keeps changing.

549
00:21:33,878 --> 00:21:34,768
It keeps changing.

550
00:21:34,768 --> 00:21:36,941
I mean I took more days off this August

551
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:40,305
that I did in my entire 20's combined.

552
00:21:40,305 --> 00:21:42,374
Why? Because I have an
eight and five year old,

553
00:21:42,374 --> 00:21:45,550
and that's what's more
important to me at this moment.

554
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,169
And in my 20's I was so on fire,

555
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:50,270
I didn't want to go to the
Jersey shore and hook-up.

556
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,904
I wanted to build something.

557
00:21:51,904 --> 00:21:53,422
And like things change.

558
00:21:53,422 --> 00:21:55,536
Now I kind of want to go
to the Jersey shore, no...

559
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:56,369
(audience laughs)

560
00:21:56,369 --> 00:21:58,729
I think things change

561
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:01,976
and I think that you need
to be prepared for that.

562
00:22:01,976 --> 00:22:06,427
I'm must fascinated on words,
pandering, and actions.

563
00:22:06,427 --> 00:22:08,450
I'm fascinated, I spend
a lot of time on this.

564
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,372
Because it helps people.

565
00:22:09,372 --> 00:22:11,612
When you suffocate them and
tell them they're full of shit

566
00:22:11,612 --> 00:22:13,634
or they're right, it's an
important conversation.

567
00:22:13,634 --> 00:22:16,537
When you're tricking yourself,
you've got a real problem.

568
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:19,665
- Yeah, well you mentioned
how things change

569
00:22:19,665 --> 00:22:20,498
and there are different mediums.

570
00:22:20,498 --> 00:22:22,862
You could try to do all
three at the same time.

571
00:22:22,862 --> 00:22:24,494
You're probably not gonna
be good at all three.

572
00:22:24,494 --> 00:22:26,518
You'll be better on
one thing than another.

573
00:22:26,518 --> 00:22:27,351
- Yes.

574
00:22:27,351 --> 00:22:28,489
- The response that you get though,

575
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:31,428
it all comes down to
understanding human behavior

576
00:22:31,428 --> 00:22:33,426
because that part doesn't change.

577
00:22:33,426 --> 00:22:35,648
How people respond to a message.

578
00:22:35,648 --> 00:22:37,960
- That's right, and I
genuinely believe the reason

579
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,215
that I've popped over the last decade

580
00:22:40,215 --> 00:22:42,673
is I'm completely obsessed
with giving more to my audience

581
00:22:42,673 --> 00:22:44,197
than I ask for in return.

582
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,431
Period, end of story, forever.

583
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,316
It's just the truth.

584
00:22:47,316 --> 00:22:49,280
I really see a lot of faces here.

585
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,457
I feel a lot of vibes from you.

586
00:22:50,457 --> 00:22:52,459
Like I'm not asking for anything.

587
00:22:52,459 --> 00:22:55,778
I'm putting out the best stuff
I've got for free everyday.

588
00:22:55,778 --> 00:22:59,870
It's not a top of funnel to
get you into my $400 ebook,

589
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,607
it's not a top of funnel
to get you to come

590
00:23:02,607 --> 00:23:05,955
and visit my island for
$25,000 for the weekend.

591
00:23:05,955 --> 00:23:08,335
It's fucking purely can I guilt you,

592
00:23:08,335 --> 00:23:13,157
because I gave you so much that
I ask for nothing in return

593
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:14,426
that it creates word of mouth.

594
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:15,641
Can I be historically correct?

595
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:17,463
Can I just bring so much value?

596
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:19,341
It's ultimate brand arbitrage.

597
00:23:19,341 --> 00:23:20,174
- Does it work?

598
00:23:20,174 --> 00:23:22,699
- 100% because so few people do it

599
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:24,498
because they're not good enough to do it.

600
00:23:24,498 --> 00:23:28,123
- [Scarlet] Give us an
example of when it worked.

601
00:23:28,123 --> 00:23:29,243
- For who, for me?

602
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:30,289
- -[Scarlet] Uh huh.

603
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:32,810
- It worked because I made a video

604
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,117
that said Twitter's dangerous to Facebook.

605
00:23:35,117 --> 00:23:36,922
It was a good thoughtful piece of content

606
00:23:36,922 --> 00:23:39,838
that led to Zucks asking
me through Dave Moren

607
00:23:39,838 --> 00:23:42,054
to fly out to Facebook
and talk to their company

608
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:43,411
when they were this size.

609
00:23:43,411 --> 00:23:45,852
I talked about human behavior in 2007.

610
00:23:45,852 --> 00:23:48,046
The whole time I didn't
know anything about Mark

611
00:23:48,046 --> 00:23:50,941
and realized how much of an
EQ guy he really was too.

612
00:23:50,941 --> 00:23:52,872
I didn't know he was
in the room like this.

613
00:23:52,872 --> 00:23:55,117
He walked down from somewhere
over there when I was done.

614
00:23:55,117 --> 00:23:56,796
He asked me if I could
have dinner with him.

615
00:23:56,796 --> 00:23:57,968
We had dinner that night

616
00:23:57,968 --> 00:24:00,453
and four months later I bought
a bunch of his parent's stock

617
00:24:00,453 --> 00:24:03,668
and made tens of millions of dollars.

618
00:24:03,668 --> 00:24:05,222
- Okay, that's a pretty good story.

619
00:24:05,222 --> 00:24:06,055
(audience and Scarlet laughs)

620
00:24:06,055 --> 00:24:07,722
- That's a good one.

621
00:24:08,732 --> 00:24:11,282
Same with Tumblr, David
Karp saw a piece of content

622
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:13,384
about how I thought about engagement.

623
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:15,473
It led to a couple of drinks in the city.

624
00:24:15,473 --> 00:24:16,524
Then he came out to Wine Library

625
00:24:16,524 --> 00:24:20,299
and the B round of Tumbler
was $14 million evaluation

626
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:21,567
and I invested very aggressively

627
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:23,261
and made lots and lots of money.

628
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:26,486
I made a piece of content
about brands and Facebook

629
00:24:26,486 --> 00:24:29,027
that Mike Lazerow saw, I gave him a quote,

630
00:24:29,027 --> 00:24:31,473
for Buddy Media's landing
page when they launched

631
00:24:31,473 --> 00:24:35,487
and I made seven figures
in advisory equity

632
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:36,320
for a quote on his website

633
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,096
on the back of a piece of content.

634
00:24:38,096 --> 00:24:40,225
- Do you still own stakes
in those companies.

635
00:24:40,225 --> 00:24:42,172
- No, I've exited all, right?

636
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:43,941
Tumblr sold to Yahoo, made money.

637
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,085
- [Scarlet] Facebook?

638
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:47,598
- Facebook I own every single share still.

639
00:24:47,598 --> 00:24:49,541
I'm going to end up making
more money on Facebook

640
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:51,573
that some of the early top 100 employees

641
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,496
because I knew what Facebook
was when it went public.

642
00:24:54,496 --> 00:24:56,500
- [Scarlet] You understood the mission?

643
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,288
- I think Zucks is an
all time entrepreneur.

644
00:24:59,288 --> 00:25:02,213
He trades attention like I do
except he's way further along

645
00:25:02,213 --> 00:25:04,102
and he can buy the companies
that are the infrastructure

646
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:07,254
but he stole Instagram, right?

647
00:25:07,254 --> 00:25:09,690
I got made fun of for saying
that the day that happened.

648
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:12,776
He tried to buy Snapchat long
before anybody gave a fuck.

649
00:25:12,776 --> 00:25:14,533
He invests in BR.

650
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:17,313
He moved a desktop company to full mobile

651
00:25:17,313 --> 00:25:20,059
when it was painful and cost prohibitive.

652
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:21,978
He understands consumer behavior.

653
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:25,228
He is an extremely all time EQ operator

654
00:25:26,221 --> 00:25:28,857
that people think is an introverted nerd.

655
00:25:28,857 --> 00:25:30,653
- But he's also gotten a
lot of negative attention,

656
00:25:30,653 --> 00:25:32,311
and Facebook as well.

657
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:33,415
The company's mired in

658
00:25:33,415 --> 00:25:35,316
the government's Russian investigation.

659
00:25:35,316 --> 00:25:36,446
- Yes.

660
00:25:36,446 --> 00:25:38,245
- There's a lot of anger
towards big tech companies,

661
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,701
towards founders like Mark Zuckerburg,

662
00:25:40,701 --> 00:25:42,066
who don't go through college

663
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:43,776
and now head up this big company.

664
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:46,091
They're billionaires.

665
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:47,799
The far left, the far right,

666
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,132
have kind of teamed up together

667
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:50,761
in their anger towards big tech.

668
00:25:50,761 --> 00:25:51,594
- Yes.

669
00:25:51,594 --> 00:25:52,730
- What's a road ahead for Facebook?

670
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,945
How does it navigate that?

671
00:25:53,945 --> 00:25:57,147
How do you see the company surviving this?

672
00:25:57,147 --> 00:25:58,008
- Easily.

673
00:25:58,008 --> 00:25:59,274
- Or thriving?

674
00:25:59,274 --> 00:26:01,042
- Easily, I don't know the details.

675
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:02,682
If they've done something horribly wrong,

676
00:26:02,682 --> 00:26:03,603
they should pay the price.

677
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:07,248
But how do I see them surviving
it, pretty darn easily.

678
00:26:07,248 --> 00:26:11,491
- [Scarlet] What about
all the public backlash?

679
00:26:11,491 --> 00:26:12,928
- Yeah, easily.

680
00:26:12,928 --> 00:26:16,377
Like everybody's using Instagram more.

681
00:26:16,377 --> 00:26:19,846
People like to say shit,
they don't act on it.

682
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:22,276
Everybody here loves to
throw up some sort of tweet

683
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:24,784
and think they're doing
a social justice move.

684
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:27,416
Why don't you fucking
do something about it?

685
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:28,961
People talk, I mean it.

686
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:30,711
It's super important.

687
00:26:32,113 --> 00:26:35,370
The day Uber was the worst and
everybody was unsubscribing

688
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:38,805
and it's terrible and I watched
four to five, six people

689
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,630
that I knew in my office and friends,

690
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,212
like unsubscribed, I hate it

691
00:26:42,212 --> 00:26:44,522
and then literally, because I'm curious,

692
00:26:44,522 --> 00:26:46,151
kinda like tagged it,

693
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:48,913
and then just watched them
take an Uber a week later.

694
00:26:48,913 --> 00:26:50,198
(audience laughs)

695
00:26:50,198 --> 00:26:52,902
We are so full of shit it's scary.

696
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:56,145
And all that big technology
is doing is exposing us,

697
00:26:56,145 --> 00:26:57,400
not changing us.

698
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,435
And we're gonna have to go
through a painful 100 years

699
00:26:59,435 --> 00:27:02,086
of understanding how full
of shit we really are.

700
00:27:02,086 --> 00:27:03,722
- Do you think government
regulators will clamp down

701
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:06,409
on the likes of Facebook, on Google,

702
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:08,715
in a way that will change

703
00:27:08,715 --> 00:27:11,437
how we interact with those platforms?

704
00:27:11,437 --> 00:27:12,719
- I think it's possible.

705
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:15,711
I never underestimate politicians

706
00:27:15,711 --> 00:27:19,288
because I don't respect them a whole lot.

707
00:27:19,288 --> 00:27:22,053
- Do they understand the platforms?

708
00:27:22,053 --> 00:27:24,072
- They may, or they may not,

709
00:27:24,072 --> 00:27:26,688
but they will only behave
in their best interests.

710
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:28,583
So I'm not sure.

711
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:29,750
- You mentioned Uber.
- Yeah.

712
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,583
- I want to bring that up

713
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:33,996
because of some of the mistakes you made.

714
00:27:33,996 --> 00:27:36,160
You passed up investing
in Uber how many times?

715
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,309
- Twice in the angel round.

716
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:41,158
Four million dollar evaluation.

717
00:27:41,158 --> 00:27:42,326
- Maybe that's not so bad now,

718
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:44,549
given that they're kind of challenged?

719
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:45,498
- Yeah, I mean they're challenged

720
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,382
but it would have been a solid bet.

721
00:27:47,382 --> 00:27:50,842
(audience and Scarlet laughing)

722
00:27:50,842 --> 00:27:52,865
Yeah, it's an interesting time at Uber.

723
00:27:52,865 --> 00:27:54,581
Travis is one of my dear, dear friends.

724
00:27:54,581 --> 00:27:57,407
One of the first friends I made in tech

725
00:27:57,407 --> 00:27:59,849
and it's been really intense

726
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:01,299
to watch what he's going through

727
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:02,678
and the thing with me is,

728
00:28:02,678 --> 00:28:04,523
you know this is a tough interview for me

729
00:28:04,523 --> 00:28:07,806
because the truth is I don't
even have the first detail yet

730
00:28:07,806 --> 00:28:08,926
about Facebook and Russia.

731
00:28:08,926 --> 00:28:09,896
I swear to God.

732
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,111
I know it's in the ecosystem.

733
00:28:11,111 --> 00:28:13,691
I really don't like headline reading.

734
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:16,287
I really don't like it.

735
00:28:16,287 --> 00:28:19,817
As I become educated,
as I'm super educated,

736
00:28:19,817 --> 00:28:22,531
I'm really in a good
place in three places.

737
00:28:22,531 --> 00:28:25,559
The current state of tech,
like consumer tech, right?

738
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:26,965
I really understand Snapchat,

739
00:28:26,965 --> 00:28:28,261
and Instagram, and Musically.

740
00:28:28,261 --> 00:28:30,425
I'm a practitioner, I
really understand it.

741
00:28:30,425 --> 00:28:31,892
There's a lot of people here
that have opinions on it

742
00:28:31,892 --> 00:28:34,281
and never done a Snapchat
ad or things like.

743
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:35,309
I really understand it.

744
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:36,475
I really understand wine.

745
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:37,647
I really understand it.

746
00:28:37,647 --> 00:28:39,733
And I really understand
the New York Jets, right?

747
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:40,566
(Scarlet laughs)

748
00:28:40,566 --> 00:28:42,471
And when I hear people talk
about those three things,

749
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:43,896
even smart people,

750
00:28:43,896 --> 00:28:46,514
I'm fascinated by when you're
really great at your craft,

751
00:28:46,514 --> 00:28:48,029
how much smarter you are

752
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:50,497
than somebody that's even good, right?

753
00:28:50,497 --> 00:28:52,654
I've gotten really quiet about most things

754
00:28:52,654 --> 00:28:56,138
because I realize I might be
somewhat of a headline reader,

755
00:28:56,138 --> 00:28:57,849
kind of a headline reader.

756
00:28:57,849 --> 00:29:00,718
I've lost all oomph in the last five years

757
00:29:00,718 --> 00:29:02,491
to talk about most issues

758
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,127
because I'm like wait a minute,

759
00:29:04,127 --> 00:29:06,422
if I sound this stupid,

760
00:29:06,422 --> 00:29:08,105
like the way my friends that

761
00:29:08,105 --> 00:29:09,644
are super smart about Facebook ads,

762
00:29:09,644 --> 00:29:11,083
and Instagram influencers, and Snapchat.

763
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,605
If I sound like this around
healthcare, or this or that,

764
00:29:14,605 --> 00:29:17,007
I must, like so you know it's interesting.

765
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:18,985
The Uber thing's really
interesting for me.

766
00:29:18,985 --> 00:29:21,623
I have a lot of emotions
cause I really adore him.

767
00:29:21,623 --> 00:29:24,262
I understand there's a
lot of things in the press

768
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,226
that have been tough.

769
00:29:25,226 --> 00:29:27,014
There's a lot of stuff
that's tough for me to,

770
00:29:27,014 --> 00:29:29,215
like you know I'm hopeful, right?

771
00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:30,618
When you care about somebody.

772
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:33,210
Obviously he's not there
anymore, which is tough.

773
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,192
It will be interesting to watch.

774
00:29:34,192 --> 00:29:36,170
The London thing's super-fascinating.

775
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,589
I don't know the details.

776
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:40,045
I'm sure there's a lot
of politics behind it.

777
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:40,979
It'll be interesting.

778
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,106
It's an interesting company.

779
00:29:42,106 --> 00:29:44,407
- You said you really understand Snapchat.

780
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,320
- Yes.

781
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,312
- But the problem with Snap is that

782
00:29:46,312 --> 00:29:48,011
whatever innovation it comes up with,

783
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:50,887
Facebook can replicate it and
do it bigger and splashier.

784
00:29:50,887 --> 00:29:51,720
- Yes.

785
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,104
- How do they go up against
a behemoth like Facebook?

786
00:29:54,104 --> 00:29:58,648
- They have to innovate in
a way that is not a feature.

787
00:29:58,648 --> 00:30:02,368
A feature is not the
way you innovate, right?

788
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:03,369
The cat's out of the bag.

789
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:07,824
Fast following features are
now going to be a way that

790
00:30:07,824 --> 00:30:09,499
is not going to allow the house parties,

791
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:10,652
or the Marco Polo's,

792
00:30:10,652 --> 00:30:12,898
or the next frontier
of things to get there.

793
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:14,832
So they're gonna have
to give it some thought.

794
00:30:14,832 --> 00:30:16,702
What's ironic about that is Snap

795
00:30:16,702 --> 00:30:19,609
is uniquely potentially a company

796
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,434
that could do that because Evan,

797
00:30:21,434 --> 00:30:22,396
and I don't know him at all,

798
00:30:22,396 --> 00:30:23,442
I've never met Evan,

799
00:30:23,442 --> 00:30:24,331
and I know a lot of Imron's,

800
00:30:24,331 --> 00:30:25,499
and a lot of the other characters,

801
00:30:25,499 --> 00:30:27,249
but he's an L.A. kid.

802
00:30:28,498 --> 00:30:31,015
He's treated Snapchat like a fashion brand

803
00:30:31,015 --> 00:30:32,633
as much as a tech company.

804
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:34,627
He actually could go left field.

805
00:30:34,627 --> 00:30:38,460
If I said to you that
it was Snap, not Adidas,

806
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:41,963
that did what they've done
for the last two years,

807
00:30:41,963 --> 00:30:43,903
to put Nike in a weird spot,

808
00:30:43,903 --> 00:30:46,193
it wouldn't seem that farfetched.

809
00:30:46,193 --> 00:30:48,272
I get where you could be like mmm.

810
00:30:48,272 --> 00:30:50,481
But it's not as far fetched
that if I said Twitter,

811
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:53,943
or Facebook, or Uber did that, right?

812
00:30:53,943 --> 00:30:57,705
And so that's where I'm
fascinated what Snap

813
00:30:57,705 --> 00:30:59,163
is gonna do or not gonna do.

814
00:30:59,163 --> 00:31:02,166
We're about to find out if
Evan was a one trick pony

815
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:04,993
or if he could adjust to the
reality of the new marketplace.

816
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:08,256
They've quietly invested
very aggressively in AR.

817
00:31:08,256 --> 00:31:09,998
You know, when you look at their M and A.

818
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:11,632
So I'd interesting to see if they can

819
00:31:11,632 --> 00:31:13,772
or will do anything there.

820
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:15,881
And then the other
question is this, right?

821
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:19,442
Which is Snap is an
incredibly big platform

822
00:31:19,442 --> 00:31:21,440
that can build a very big business.

823
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,422
It's just that the market
put all of the value in

824
00:31:24,422 --> 00:31:25,942
to that it was gonna continue to grow

825
00:31:25,942 --> 00:31:28,033
and be 30, 40, 50, 60 year olds.

826
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:30,037
So what's fascinating with Snap

827
00:31:30,037 --> 00:31:32,881
is gonna be that it's probably over valued

828
00:31:32,881 --> 00:31:34,556
in a Wall Street dynamic,

829
00:31:34,556 --> 00:31:38,675
even amongst everything being over valued.

830
00:31:38,675 --> 00:31:39,896
They're gonna have to do something.

831
00:31:39,896 --> 00:31:41,534
They're gonna have to truly innovate

832
00:31:41,534 --> 00:31:43,542
and it will be interesting
to see if they can do it.

833
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:47,455
But again, if Marissa buys
Instagram for a billion

834
00:31:47,455 --> 00:31:49,331
instead of Tumblr,

835
00:31:49,331 --> 00:31:51,850
who knows what could have happened, right?

836
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,652
That's what's amazing about business.

837
00:31:53,652 --> 00:31:56,661
You're always one good
or one bad move away

838
00:31:56,661 --> 00:31:58,598
from changing the narrative.

839
00:31:58,598 --> 00:32:00,884
And I love that about this game.

840
00:32:00,884 --> 00:32:02,825
Like I never get caught
up in it's going well

841
00:32:02,825 --> 00:32:04,342
and I'm in this fancy building

842
00:32:04,342 --> 00:32:06,417
and all these amazing people
are looking at me right now.

843
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:09,127
Tomorrow could be the
beginning of the complete end.

844
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:09,960
I love that.

845
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,566
Doesn't matter what
I've done for 20 years.

846
00:32:12,566 --> 00:32:15,616
- How does Twitter change the narrative?

847
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,910
The user growth has
slowed down tremendously,

848
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,213
it's kind of become a niche product.

849
00:32:20,213 --> 00:32:23,548
It's not panning out the way
a lot of investors had hoped.

850
00:32:23,548 --> 00:32:24,783
It's now looking to expand

851
00:32:24,783 --> 00:32:27,723
the character limit to 280 from 140.

852
00:32:27,723 --> 00:32:30,087
I don't know if this is
gonna make a big difference.

853
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:31,640
- Yeah, that's not gonna be it, right?

854
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,473
(Scarlet and audience laughs)

855
00:32:32,473 --> 00:32:33,555
I think we can all agree with that.

856
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:34,827
But I do think since Jack's back,

857
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:37,826
I mean look, and Dick is one
of my favorite people on earth,

858
00:32:37,826 --> 00:32:41,246
but in that four years the
product didn't innovate once.

859
00:32:41,246 --> 00:32:43,200
The product just did not innovate

860
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,376
and so at least since Jack's been back

861
00:32:46,376 --> 00:32:48,613
for the last 18 months
or whatever it's been,

862
00:32:48,613 --> 00:32:50,180
there's been little, subtle things.

863
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,210
I mean literally, and I know
there are a lot of people

864
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,086
in this room, like remember?

865
00:32:53,086 --> 00:32:54,278
It was literally four or five years,

866
00:32:54,278 --> 00:32:55,873
literally same exact product.

867
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:58,392
Even like start to heart, or like retweet.

868
00:32:58,392 --> 00:33:00,494
Like little subtle things.

869
00:33:00,494 --> 00:33:02,990
I thought it was superinteresting

870
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:03,823
what Twitter was doing

871
00:33:03,823 --> 00:33:05,526
when they were buying up all the rights,

872
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:06,807
because I thought they
were actually building

873
00:33:06,807 --> 00:33:11,010
a true Netflix competitor
as an OTT player.

874
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:13,861
I just don't know if they
have the right talent in place

875
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:15,644
to navigate it to be that,

876
00:33:15,644 --> 00:33:17,026
but I thought it was the right idea.

877
00:33:17,026 --> 00:33:18,940
I do think that Facebook,

878
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,638
and Snap, and Twitter

879
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:24,805
are absolutely the potential
OTT challengers of the future.

880
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,195
And I thought they were earlier

881
00:33:28,195 --> 00:33:30,095
to move on that than the others,

882
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:33,196
but they needed to move
smarter, better, faster

883
00:33:33,196 --> 00:33:35,203
and I feel like they didn't.

884
00:33:35,203 --> 00:33:38,436
They just ended up doing
a six execution or a four,

885
00:33:38,436 --> 00:33:41,665
instead of the 10 they
needed to rally get there.

886
00:33:41,665 --> 00:33:43,192
- Do you think we're in a bubble

887
00:33:43,192 --> 00:33:44,851
when it comes to these big tech companies

888
00:33:44,851 --> 00:33:47,012
and how much money we're throwing at them

889
00:33:47,012 --> 00:33:49,666
and what investors expect from them?

890
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:53,567
- I think Amazon and Facebook
are grossly under priced.

891
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:54,687
- Explain.

892
00:33:54,687 --> 00:33:56,122
- I think Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg,

893
00:33:56,122 --> 00:33:57,079
as long as they don't die,

894
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:00,297
are gonna make them grossly under priced.

895
00:34:00,297 --> 00:34:02,630
- What's Amazon's next move?

896
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,100
- Being sued by the government.

897
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,644
(audience laughs)

898
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,933
Amazon is so incredible.

899
00:34:08,933 --> 00:34:10,730
I remember four or five
years ago at a keynote,

900
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,922
and I don't remember if Steve Jobs

901
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:14,746
had passed away or was sick,

902
00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:16,562
but I remember saying that I thought Bezos

903
00:34:16,563 --> 00:34:18,161
was better than Steve Jobs

904
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:19,185
and I got really booed.

905
00:34:19,186 --> 00:34:20,731
And this was the height of Apple.

906
00:34:20,731 --> 00:34:22,474
And Amazon was four, five years ago,

907
00:34:22,474 --> 00:34:24,273
which not what we think of Amazon today.

908
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:27,606
But AWS sawdust, like the way he bought,

909
00:34:29,743 --> 00:34:33,502
like even the losses like
LivingSocial and Woot,

910
00:34:33,502 --> 00:34:35,320
he was just doing things
and I was like fuck man,

911
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,821
Bezos has moves, right?

912
00:34:36,821 --> 00:34:38,793
Like Steve Jobs is all time,

913
00:34:38,793 --> 00:34:40,418
but he had the same move,

914
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:41,910
rinse and repeat, in a lot of ways,

915
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:44,469
if you understand how
I'm kind of framing it.

916
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:46,208
Bezos was throwing all sorts of different.

917
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:48,796
It was kind of like the
difference between boxing and MMA.

918
00:34:48,797 --> 00:34:52,428
I was like Jeff, I think
he could do anything.

919
00:34:52,428 --> 00:34:54,101
Like I woke up and Amazon buys Whole Foods

920
00:34:54,101 --> 00:34:55,695
and I'm like yep.

921
00:34:55,696 --> 00:34:56,529
- [Scarlet] That's us.

922
00:34:56,529 --> 00:34:59,655
- Tomorrow if I wake up,
like Amazon buys the NHL,

923
00:34:59,655 --> 00:35:01,031
I'm like mm-hmm.

924
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:02,864
(audience laughs)

925
00:35:02,864 --> 00:35:04,872
I think everything is white space for him.

926
00:35:04,872 --> 00:35:07,364
I think he is absolutely the guy.

927
00:35:07,364 --> 00:35:09,263
I'm so impressed with their execution.

928
00:35:09,263 --> 00:35:13,406
I'm so excited to watch them do more stuff

929
00:35:13,406 --> 00:35:15,152
and I'm genuinely hopeful
that they understand

930
00:35:15,152 --> 00:35:17,363
how to navigate so that the
government doesn't stop them

931
00:35:17,363 --> 00:35:19,659
because they feel to me
more than any company,

932
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,081
as the company that could,

933
00:35:21,081 --> 00:35:23,914
because I think they could
win the whole fucking thing.

934
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:25,829
They have the stack.

935
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:29,951
When you start understanding
that Alexa is this close

936
00:35:29,951 --> 00:35:31,378
to becoming the next search engine.

937
00:35:31,378 --> 00:35:33,086
When you understand that
you're brushing your teeth

938
00:35:33,086 --> 00:35:34,172
and you run out of it,

939
00:35:34,172 --> 00:35:35,472
and you're like Alexa reorder it for me.

940
00:35:35,472 --> 00:35:37,704
When you start understanding
what they're doing

941
00:35:37,704 --> 00:35:39,316
and the way they're putting
their pieces together.

942
00:35:39,316 --> 00:35:40,149
When you understand

943
00:35:40,149 --> 00:35:41,133
when you're watching
Thursday night football,

944
00:35:41,133 --> 00:35:42,733
and Des Bryant scores a touchdown,

945
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:45,302
and at the height of your
emotion you can order his jersey

946
00:35:45,302 --> 00:35:47,811
by saying Alexa order that jersey

947
00:35:47,811 --> 00:35:50,271
or whatever they tell you
to do while you're watching

948
00:35:50,271 --> 00:35:51,834
because they're full stack.

949
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:55,844
They are an unbelievably crafty business.

950
00:35:55,844 --> 00:35:57,410
He buys under priced things,

951
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:59,593
buying the Washington Post at the time.

952
00:35:59,593 --> 00:36:01,281
That Washington Post
and Boston Globe trade

953
00:36:01,281 --> 00:36:03,349
at the time of newspapers biggest demise

954
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:05,731
the brand was so much more worth than this

955
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:06,824
to put it on the tablet.

956
00:36:06,824 --> 00:36:08,113
Whether the fire worked or not,

957
00:36:08,113 --> 00:36:09,227
it was irrelevant.

958
00:36:09,227 --> 00:36:10,690
It was the right thesis,

959
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:13,288
and here's the thing
about great entrepreneurs,

960
00:36:13,288 --> 00:36:15,277
whether Oculus is right or not,

961
00:36:15,277 --> 00:36:16,668
it's the right thesis.

962
00:36:16,668 --> 00:36:17,905
When you're a great entrepreneur,

963
00:36:17,905 --> 00:36:19,291
and you're betting like that,

964
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:21,391
you just have to be right
once out of every eight times

965
00:36:21,391 --> 00:36:23,973
to make the whole thing work.

966
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:27,123
Great entrepreneurs do not
care about their losses,

967
00:36:27,123 --> 00:36:29,526
because they're their losses, right?

968
00:36:29,526 --> 00:36:31,706
And average entrepreneurs
and non-entrepreneurs

969
00:36:31,706 --> 00:36:33,562
always care about other people's opinions

970
00:36:33,562 --> 00:36:35,919
about their losses.

971
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:37,103
- Good to remember.

972
00:36:37,103 --> 00:36:38,159
Good to keep in mind.

973
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:39,447
All right, let's get to lightning round,

974
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,872
where I just basically have a lot

975
00:36:40,872 --> 00:36:44,831
of random questions I want
to get Gary's opinion on.

976
00:36:44,831 --> 00:36:47,038
What's the most overrated new technology?

977
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,908
- Consumer VR, and let me explain why.

978
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:54,125
For us right now as a practical function,

979
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:55,931
I believe in consumer VR,

980
00:36:55,931 --> 00:36:57,134
I just don't think you're gonna see a lot

981
00:36:57,134 --> 00:37:00,289
of consumers really
doing impactful VR stuff

982
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:03,268
the way you want to over
the next 36 to 48 months.

983
00:37:03,268 --> 00:37:04,789
You still don't know a single person

984
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:08,956
that spends a good hour a
day in VR hardcore, right?

985
00:37:09,971 --> 00:37:11,858
- Do you know anyone in the
tech community who does?

986
00:37:11,858 --> 00:37:14,166
- Yeah, I'm sure there's
some hardcore people.

987
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:16,157
It's funny, the first
VR people I was meeting

988
00:37:16,157 --> 00:37:17,175
like 18 months ago,

989
00:37:17,175 --> 00:37:18,008
they were so nerdy.

990
00:37:18,008 --> 00:37:19,245
I'm like, okay, this is good,

991
00:37:19,245 --> 00:37:20,078
(Scarlet laughs)

992
00:37:20,078 --> 00:37:20,911
like, these are real nerds again.

993
00:37:20,911 --> 00:37:22,995
This isn't the club
promoters of fucked up tech,

994
00:37:22,995 --> 00:37:24,090
these are nerds, you know?

995
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,967
So that was cool,

996
00:37:25,967 --> 00:37:29,651
but I mean I really don't
even know of a story,

997
00:37:29,651 --> 00:37:31,593
like it's not there yet.

998
00:37:31,593 --> 00:37:34,035
So I think consumer VR is
gonna lose a lot of money

999
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:35,126
for a lot of people.

1000
00:37:35,126 --> 00:37:36,891
It's a great B to B thing.

1001
00:37:36,891 --> 00:37:38,060
It's great to go to the Superbowl,

1002
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,791
and like do a brand activation,

1003
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:42,797
but nobody's sitting at home
for an hour on VR yet for real,

1004
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:43,738
and I don't think that's gonna happen

1005
00:37:43,738 --> 00:37:45,414
for another three, four years,

1006
00:37:45,414 --> 00:37:49,331
like real, and that to
me feels like overrated,

1007
00:37:50,495 --> 00:37:51,328
we all know it's coming.

1008
00:37:51,328 --> 00:37:53,424
I think in 20 years it
could be disproportionately,

1009
00:37:53,424 --> 00:37:55,534
it could arbitrage the
whole internet itself,

1010
00:37:55,534 --> 00:37:57,339
just short term.

1011
00:37:57,339 --> 00:37:59,521
I care about timing.

1012
00:37:59,521 --> 00:38:00,800
Timing's what matters,

1013
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,760
and so not a fan right now.

1014
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,992
- [Scarlet] Not a fan right now.

1015
00:38:03,992 --> 00:38:06,456
Who's a young and upcoming entrepreneur

1016
00:38:06,456 --> 00:38:07,889
that you're watching out for,

1017
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:11,281
that could really be the next Jeff Bazos?

1018
00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:14,729
- I mean, at that level, I'm not sure.

1019
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:17,155
I don't know if I've seen it.

1020
00:38:17,155 --> 00:38:20,405
- Okay, could be the next Evan Spiegel?

1021
00:38:21,454 --> 00:38:23,459
- So, you know, I don't have an answer.

1022
00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:25,895
I've also not been investing
a whole lot lately,

1023
00:38:25,895 --> 00:38:29,028
because I think the market
is grossly overpriced for,

1024
00:38:29,028 --> 00:38:33,117
I don't think ideas should be
worth four million dollars.

1025
00:38:33,117 --> 00:38:35,559
I'm a big fan of Rachel Tipograph,

1026
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:36,845
the founder of MikMak.

1027
00:38:36,845 --> 00:38:38,687
I think she's a fuckin' gangster.

1028
00:38:38,687 --> 00:38:40,027
- What does the company do?

1029
00:38:40,027 --> 00:38:42,532
- She's pimpin' it six times
in the last 15 minutes.

1030
00:38:42,532 --> 00:38:44,951
(Scarlet and audience laugh)

1031
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:46,629
It was originally mobile video.

1032
00:38:46,629 --> 00:38:48,131
It was was QVC for mobile,

1033
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:50,643
then it became a SAS product
for brands, mobile integration,

1034
00:38:50,643 --> 00:38:53,970
swipe up shopability
in stories in Snapchat.

1035
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:56,387
Her tenacity is intoxicating.

1036
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,012
- All right, that's a name
that we'll watch out for.

1037
00:39:03,012 --> 00:39:03,845
- Yeah, I think that,

1038
00:39:03,845 --> 00:39:05,190
you know what's fun for me?

1039
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,514
I don't think that name populates

1040
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:08,176
for another seven, 12 years,

1041
00:39:08,176 --> 00:39:10,984
but when I recall this
clips on the internet seven,

1042
00:39:10,984 --> 00:39:14,189
12 years, it's gonna feel real good.

1043
00:39:14,189 --> 00:39:16,665
- Gary, Bitcoin or Ethereum?

1044
00:39:16,665 --> 00:39:17,554
- Ethereum.

1045
00:39:17,554 --> 00:39:18,387
- Why?

1046
00:39:18,387 --> 00:39:21,729
- Because it's more of a
platform than the singular brand.

1047
00:39:21,729 --> 00:39:23,265
It's Blockchain, then it's Ethereum,

1048
00:39:23,265 --> 00:39:24,226
then it's Bitcoin.

1049
00:39:24,226 --> 00:39:25,957
So I don't think people understand, right?

1050
00:39:25,957 --> 00:39:29,635
It's like WordPress,
and Netscape Navigator,

1051
00:39:29,635 --> 00:39:30,938
or Yahoo.com.

1052
00:39:30,938 --> 00:39:33,443
Bitcoin could win, and
could become a brand,

1053
00:39:33,443 --> 00:39:34,860
like a Nike, and could be amazing,

1054
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,827
and all that, but Ethereum
is the infrastructure above,

1055
00:39:37,827 --> 00:39:40,025
which you build on top of.

1056
00:39:40,025 --> 00:39:40,858
Blockchain, bless you,

1057
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:44,403
Blockchain is the most
gangster shit going on,

1058
00:39:44,403 --> 00:39:45,750
and I'll explain why.

1059
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,157
If you truly understand the chess moves

1060
00:39:48,157 --> 00:39:50,879
of decentralizing everything,

1061
00:39:50,879 --> 00:39:53,935
well then the whole damn world's on call.

1062
00:39:53,935 --> 00:39:55,791
Governments included.

1063
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:58,615
So, could be interesting.

1064
00:39:58,615 --> 00:40:00,442
- What's one brand that's doing everything

1065
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:02,282
it's supposed to and more?

1066
00:40:02,282 --> 00:40:04,760
That's hitting it on all cylinders?

1067
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,121
- I've never been able
to answer this question,

1068
00:40:06,121 --> 00:40:07,660
and let me tell you why.

1069
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,042
I don't pay attention to other brands.

1070
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:11,341
So, at Vayner,

1071
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:13,091
when we have Budweiser as a client,

1072
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:15,905
maybe my team, let me rephrase,

1073
00:40:15,905 --> 00:40:19,256
I hope my team for Budweiser
is looking at Miller Light,

1074
00:40:19,256 --> 00:40:20,225
and other things.

1075
00:40:20,225 --> 00:40:24,691
I think a brand doing
everything right means

1076
00:40:24,691 --> 00:40:27,490
that all their behaviors are
leading to a healthy business,

1077
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,708
not more likes.

1078
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:30,832
When Burberry, or Taco
Bell are getting all

1079
00:40:30,832 --> 00:40:32,799
the accolades in the press,

1080
00:40:32,799 --> 00:40:33,790
I never know if it's real.

1081
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,829
I understand that it's moving quickly,

1082
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:38,500
and doing good work on new stuff,

1083
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,845
I just don't know if it's
actually driving business.

1084
00:40:40,845 --> 00:40:43,120
There's a big disconnect
between being innovative

1085
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,659
and making business
decisions that are fruitful,

1086
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:47,326
and so I'm not sure,

1087
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,431
but I would say the ones that are spending

1088
00:40:50,431 --> 00:40:52,405
the least amount of money to make

1089
00:40:52,405 --> 00:40:53,824
the most amount of money in return.

1090
00:40:53,824 --> 00:40:55,208
(Scarlet laughs)

1091
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:56,549
- Money out versus money in.

1092
00:40:56,549 --> 00:40:58,714
How would you advise,

1093
00:40:58,714 --> 00:40:59,547
let's say the NFL,

1094
00:40:59,547 --> 00:41:00,535
to reclaim it's glory?

1095
00:41:00,535 --> 00:41:02,699
It's under some pressure these days.

1096
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:06,616
How would you advise it
to get its groove back?

1097
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:10,821
Could it do it through social media?

1098
00:41:10,821 --> 00:41:12,433
- No. No, it's way,

1099
00:41:12,433 --> 00:41:15,016
way, way, way bigger than that,

1100
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:19,807
and it's not concussions,
of President Trump,

1101
00:41:19,807 --> 00:41:21,517
it's so many variables.

1102
00:41:21,517 --> 00:41:24,728
First of all, fantasy football's dynamic

1103
00:41:24,728 --> 00:41:25,797
has been really intriguing,

1104
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:27,966
because you've gotten people to care more

1105
00:41:27,966 --> 00:41:30,182
about players than teams.

1106
00:41:30,182 --> 00:41:32,260
You've got the RedZone channel

1107
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,851
is such an incredible product,

1108
00:41:33,851 --> 00:41:35,545
like it's completely addictive,

1109
00:41:35,545 --> 00:41:37,269
like it's just a better experience

1110
00:41:37,269 --> 00:41:39,511
if you love the sport of football.

1111
00:41:39,511 --> 00:41:42,327
The man cave and the
high quality technology

1112
00:41:42,327 --> 00:41:43,619
has made it so much more interesting

1113
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:46,810
to be home than go to the game.

1114
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:47,847
- But even when you're at home,

1115
00:41:47,847 --> 00:41:49,893
people don't watch as
much as they used to.

1116
00:41:49,893 --> 00:41:50,726
- Yeah, I mean,

1117
00:41:50,726 --> 00:41:51,559
I think it hit a tipping point.

1118
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:53,862
I mean, everybody like Jesus Christ,

1119
00:41:53,862 --> 00:41:55,264
it was like two years ago,

1120
00:41:55,264 --> 00:41:58,745
what the NFL has accomplished
over the last couple years

1121
00:41:58,745 --> 00:42:00,412
is iconic, all time.

1122
00:42:03,149 --> 00:42:05,535
It's got so popular,

1123
00:42:05,535 --> 00:42:07,918
and now soccer really,

1124
00:42:07,918 --> 00:42:11,023
the U.S. going to the sweet
16 of two World Cups in a row

1125
00:42:11,023 --> 00:42:14,236
is a very subtle thing that
people underestimate, right?

1126
00:42:14,236 --> 00:42:16,553
The distribution rights of

1127
00:42:16,553 --> 00:42:19,075
the English Premier League allowing kids

1128
00:42:19,075 --> 00:42:22,527
to watch in the mornings and
go with their dad at 7:00 a.m.

1129
00:42:22,527 --> 00:42:24,762
to do things is grossly underestimated,

1130
00:42:24,762 --> 00:42:27,771
Esports is fundamentally
being disrespected

1131
00:42:27,771 --> 00:42:29,315
for how big it actually is,

1132
00:42:29,315 --> 00:42:33,315
and all of this is chopping
away at the ratings.

1133
00:42:34,409 --> 00:42:37,186
It is still the disproportionate
most popular sport

1134
00:42:37,186 --> 00:42:38,019
in our country,

1135
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:40,797
it's still doing incredibly fine.

1136
00:42:40,797 --> 00:42:42,721
I think it is laughable to diss the NFL

1137
00:42:42,721 --> 00:42:43,943
for their business issues,

1138
00:42:43,943 --> 00:42:48,064
and applaud Nascar, which has
become completely irrelevant.

1139
00:42:48,064 --> 00:42:49,585
- Which has seen its own ratings drop

1140
00:42:49,585 --> 00:42:50,987
over the years, long before.

1141
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:53,564
- Nascar has fucking collapsed.

1142
00:42:53,564 --> 00:42:55,271
Nascar's down half.

1143
00:42:55,271 --> 00:42:56,937
Nascar's over.

1144
00:42:56,937 --> 00:42:59,257
Nascar doesn't even exist.

1145
00:42:59,257 --> 00:43:03,559
So it's like, if we're
talking the impact of stuff,

1146
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:04,970
you know, that's a laughable argument

1147
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,161
the President's trying to make.

1148
00:43:06,161 --> 00:43:10,076
Nascar's finished, Esports is coming,

1149
00:43:10,076 --> 00:43:13,969
and the NFL is where baseball was in 1984,

1150
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:15,192
you know, or 1973.

1151
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,707
It's like in that apex moment,

1152
00:43:16,707 --> 00:43:20,277
and there's only one way
to go from that level.

1153
00:43:20,277 --> 00:43:21,402
- How much closer are you

1154
00:43:21,402 --> 00:43:23,159
to your life goal of buying the Jets?

1155
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:23,992
- Closer.

1156
00:43:23,992 --> 00:43:25,338
(Scarlet and audience laughs)

1157
00:43:25,338 --> 00:43:28,122
And closer because I think the way I play

1158
00:43:28,122 --> 00:43:29,937
is very different than Zucks,

1159
00:43:29,937 --> 00:43:32,827
or other people, which is
I don't do any behavior

1160
00:43:32,827 --> 00:43:35,745
that creates quick, massive wealth.

1161
00:43:35,745 --> 00:43:38,934
I don't do the things that
create quick, massive wealth.

1162
00:43:38,934 --> 00:43:41,466
I don't start companies
that can get to that level,

1163
00:43:41,466 --> 00:43:43,249
I don't invest the level of capital

1164
00:43:43,249 --> 00:43:44,724
that can get to that level,

1165
00:43:44,724 --> 00:43:46,246
I'm running a marathon.

1166
00:43:46,246 --> 00:43:48,283
A really long marathon,

1167
00:43:48,283 --> 00:43:49,765
but I'm 41 years old, right?

1168
00:43:49,765 --> 00:43:52,620
So to me, if I buy the Jets in 23 years,

1169
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,068
I feel like I'm a young man.

1170
00:43:54,068 --> 00:43:56,881
I feel like I hang out with
a lot of 64 year old men

1171
00:43:56,881 --> 00:43:58,573
and women who feel super young with me,

1172
00:43:58,573 --> 00:43:59,500
and super on fire,

1173
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,994
and have a lot more to do,

1174
00:44:00,994 --> 00:44:03,117
and I think if I buy the Jets at 64,

1175
00:44:03,117 --> 00:44:04,313
that gives me plenty of time

1176
00:44:04,313 --> 00:44:05,854
to win seven Superbowls in 30 years,

1177
00:44:05,854 --> 00:44:07,200
(Scarlet and audience laugh)

1178
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,618
and then I could move on with myself.

1179
00:44:08,618 --> 00:44:09,779
- That's very ambitious.

1180
00:44:09,779 --> 00:44:10,668
If you can't get the Jets,

1181
00:44:10,668 --> 00:44:11,872
what's the next best thing?

1182
00:44:11,872 --> 00:44:12,705
- The Knicks.

1183
00:44:12,705 --> 00:44:14,771
(Scarlet and audience laugh)

1184
00:44:14,771 --> 00:44:15,604
- All right, the Johnson's

1185
00:44:15,604 --> 00:44:17,065
and the Dolan's need to watch out.

1186
00:44:17,065 --> 00:44:19,763
We're gonna open this up to
everyone in the audience,

1187
00:44:19,763 --> 00:44:22,060
because I know who guys all
have questions for Gary.

1188
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,359
We have microphones, so
if you raise your hand,

1189
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:26,384
let me know, and then this gentleman

1190
00:44:26,384 --> 00:44:28,722
in front will pass you a microphone.

1191
00:44:28,722 --> 00:44:29,722
- Thank you.

1192
00:44:31,662 --> 00:44:33,811
- [Daniel] So looking at industries.

1193
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:35,399
- Which industry?

1194
00:44:35,399 --> 00:44:36,810
- [Daniel] Just in general right now.

1195
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,383
- Which industry?

1196
00:44:38,383 --> 00:44:39,904
- [Daniel] It's more
like an overall, yeah.

1197
00:44:39,904 --> 00:44:40,737
- I'm sorry.

1198
00:44:40,737 --> 00:44:42,257
- [Daniel] So you see

1199
00:44:42,257 --> 00:44:44,102
like Blockbuster totally ignored Netflix.

1200
00:44:44,102 --> 00:44:44,935
- Yes.

1201
00:44:44,935 --> 00:44:47,045
- And now, what's Blockbuster?

1202
00:44:47,045 --> 00:44:50,012
What other institutions
do you see, kind of?

1203
00:44:50,012 --> 00:44:51,296
- [Gary] All of retail. All of it.

1204
00:44:51,296 --> 00:44:54,075
- Yeah, so what advise would
you have for the Baby Boomers,

1205
00:44:54,075 --> 00:44:57,142
and the executives today
who aren't paying attention

1206
00:44:57,142 --> 00:45:00,406
to the tech companies about
what's coming tomorrow?

1207
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,239
- Yeah, so Daniel,

1208
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:02,687
I think it's a different conversation.

1209
00:45:02,687 --> 00:45:04,123
So, let him hold it for a second,

1210
00:45:04,123 --> 00:45:06,000
you're talking about those decision makers

1211
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,133
at those retail companies

1212
00:45:07,133 --> 00:45:10,135
that aren't doing the
right thing to protect it?

1213
00:45:10,135 --> 00:45:10,968
- [Daniel] I don't think,

1214
00:45:10,968 --> 00:45:12,390
it's not just retail anymore.

1215
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,457
- It's everything, I agree with you,

1216
00:45:13,457 --> 00:45:16,881
but what's the advice to
the people running them,

1217
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:17,875
or the consumer?

1218
00:45:17,875 --> 00:45:19,171
I want to make sure I understand.

1219
00:45:19,171 --> 00:45:20,004
- [Daniel] To the people running them.

1220
00:45:20,004 --> 00:45:21,387
It's seem like right now they're

1221
00:45:21,387 --> 00:45:22,419
not listening to the Millennials,

1222
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,285
and not listening to the upstarts.

1223
00:45:24,285 --> 00:45:25,118
- Yeah, it's not about that.

1224
00:45:25,118 --> 00:45:25,981
You know what it's about?

1225
00:45:25,981 --> 00:45:30,225
It's about the fact that
they are trying to milk

1226
00:45:30,225 --> 00:45:31,917
the next 24 to 36 months,

1227
00:45:31,917 --> 00:45:34,483
because their bonuses, and stock options,

1228
00:45:34,483 --> 00:45:37,587
and their life when their
done running this company

1229
00:45:37,587 --> 00:45:40,527
is based on what the stock
price is in 24 months,

1230
00:45:40,527 --> 00:45:41,795
so they can buy their yacht,

1231
00:45:41,795 --> 00:45:43,199
and their private jet,

1232
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,421
and so what all these CEOs
are doing in public companies

1233
00:45:46,421 --> 00:45:48,452
is they're not being incentivized properly

1234
00:45:48,452 --> 00:45:49,736
for the health of the company,

1235
00:45:49,736 --> 00:45:52,792
and we're living through the
biggest culture shift we run,

1236
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,332
because we're living
through a true revolution,

1237
00:45:54,332 --> 00:45:55,768
a true industrial revolution.

1238
00:45:55,768 --> 00:45:57,550
So what's happening is,

1239
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:00,717
I am not mad at the Fortune 5,000 CEOs

1240
00:46:02,321 --> 00:46:03,706
because they're human beings,

1241
00:46:03,706 --> 00:46:04,744
and what they're doing is saying,

1242
00:46:04,744 --> 00:46:06,787
I'm gonna be in this world
for another 24 months,

1243
00:46:06,787 --> 00:46:07,963
I'm not gonna do the thing

1244
00:46:07,963 --> 00:46:10,248
that hurts the stock
price by over investing,

1245
00:46:10,248 --> 00:46:14,524
and having shitty PNL
to invest 100 million,

1246
00:46:14,524 --> 00:46:16,376
500 million in the thing that needs,

1247
00:46:16,376 --> 00:46:17,696
I have to put myself out of business

1248
00:46:17,696 --> 00:46:19,074
before somebody else does,

1249
00:46:19,074 --> 00:46:20,115
I'm not gonna do that,

1250
00:46:20,115 --> 00:46:23,002
because I'm gonna have
eight bad quarters in a row,

1251
00:46:23,002 --> 00:46:25,110
I'm gonna be on this network
show every morning saying,

1252
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:26,854
I suck, right?

1253
00:46:26,854 --> 00:46:28,305
And then I'm gonna get kicked out,

1254
00:46:28,305 --> 00:46:29,636
and I'm gonna lose,

1255
00:46:29,636 --> 00:46:31,772
but Hershey's, or QuickGain,

1256
00:46:31,772 --> 00:46:34,226
or Hertz is gonna win.

1257
00:46:34,226 --> 00:46:37,476
They're not dumb, they're just selfish.

1258
00:46:38,731 --> 00:46:40,289
- It's about the short term.

1259
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:44,418
- Pfft. I mean, why do big
companies go out of business?

1260
00:46:44,418 --> 00:46:46,668
Because Wall Street exists.

1261
00:46:48,774 --> 00:46:50,699
So, they know.

1262
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:52,083
Way more than you think, my man.

1263
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:53,001
They know.

1264
00:46:53,001 --> 00:46:55,910
They just aren't incentivized to do that.

1265
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:57,647
- [Scarlet] This gentleman.

1266
00:46:57,647 --> 00:46:59,411
- They're gonna retire
with a lot of money, bro.

1267
00:46:59,411 --> 00:47:01,998
They're gonna retire with
a lot of money, right?

1268
00:47:01,998 --> 00:47:02,934
But if they listen to you,

1269
00:47:02,934 --> 00:47:04,720
they're gonna retire with less.

1270
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,970
(laughter)

1271
00:47:07,987 --> 00:47:11,082
And that's why entrepreneurs
have so much opportunity,

1272
00:47:11,082 --> 00:47:12,950
because they're playing a different game.

1273
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:14,765
Everything I do is for
the rest of my life,

1274
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:18,664
for my legacy, for my family, for myself.

1275
00:47:18,664 --> 00:47:19,709
So I care about my business,

1276
00:47:19,709 --> 00:47:20,913
I care about my people,

1277
00:47:20,913 --> 00:47:22,212
because it's forever,

1278
00:47:22,212 --> 00:47:24,091
not I'm gonna use this as a stepping stone

1279
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,492
to get on three public boards,

1280
00:47:25,492 --> 00:47:27,195
and da da da da da.

1281
00:47:27,195 --> 00:47:28,028
So, that's what's happening.

1282
00:47:28,028 --> 00:47:29,759
That's real life, everybody knows it.

1283
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:30,784
Nobody talks about it,

1284
00:47:30,784 --> 00:47:32,108
but when I talk about it,

1285
00:47:32,108 --> 00:47:33,529
all the people shake their heads,

1286
00:47:33,529 --> 00:47:34,362
because everybody knows
that's what's happening

1287
00:47:34,362 --> 00:47:36,827
with every company that is trading,

1288
00:47:36,827 --> 00:47:38,045
and what this building
talks about all day long.

1289
00:47:38,045 --> 00:47:40,529
Every one of them do that.

1290
00:47:40,529 --> 00:47:42,995
Every one of them do that.

1291
00:47:42,995 --> 00:47:44,578
It's fucking crazy,

1292
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,847
but it's great for me
because it's gonna allow me

1293
00:47:47,847 --> 00:47:52,328
to buy great brands for
nickels on the dollar,

1294
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:54,522
and I'm excited about it.

1295
00:47:54,522 --> 00:47:55,756
- [Audience Member One] Hi, Gary.

1296
00:47:55,756 --> 00:47:57,566
Thanks, big fan,

1297
00:47:57,566 --> 00:47:58,424
listen to you all the time.

1298
00:47:58,424 --> 00:48:00,675
Question, what are your
thoughts on AirBnB,

1299
00:48:00,675 --> 00:48:03,258
and home sharing, and the
future sort of lifestyle

1300
00:48:03,258 --> 00:48:07,040
of nomadic people visiting
different places, and so on?

1301
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,376
- I think it will continue to grow.

1302
00:48:08,376 --> 00:48:10,680
I think Bryan's a really sharp CO.

1303
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,577
I should also mention,

1304
00:48:11,577 --> 00:48:14,112
I co-founded a company I
haven't operated called Resy

1305
00:48:14,112 --> 00:48:16,353
that just did a fairly big deal with them.

1306
00:48:16,353 --> 00:48:17,859
Ben Leventhal, the CO,

1307
00:48:17,859 --> 00:48:19,241
and Mike Montero deserve all the credit.

1308
00:48:19,241 --> 00:48:21,287
I was in the idea phase,

1309
00:48:21,287 --> 00:48:23,935
and the capital phase.

1310
00:48:23,935 --> 00:48:25,588
So I hope he continues to do well,

1311
00:48:25,588 --> 00:48:27,664
because it's a big partnership.

1312
00:48:27,664 --> 00:48:29,014
What a big one.

1313
00:48:29,014 --> 00:48:29,847
I have an e-mail,

1314
00:48:29,847 --> 00:48:31,252
there's another miss for me,

1315
00:48:31,252 --> 00:48:35,620
got an e-mail from
joe@airbedandbreakfast.com.

1316
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,207
Dear Gary Vee, I'm a huge fan,

1317
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:39,184
we'd love for you to see our startup.

1318
00:48:39,184 --> 00:48:40,406
Never replied. Missed it.

1319
00:48:40,406 --> 00:48:41,710
(Scarlet and audience groan)

1320
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:42,543
It's a good one.

1321
00:48:42,543 --> 00:48:43,376
- You read it though, right?

1322
00:48:43,376 --> 00:48:45,293
It didn't go into spam.

1323
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:47,310
- I don't know.

1324
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:49,002
Like, one of my assistants found it,

1325
00:48:49,002 --> 00:48:51,226
I don't know if I had
read it or not read it,

1326
00:48:51,226 --> 00:48:52,725
all I know is it happened,

1327
00:48:52,725 --> 00:48:54,642
and I've got in folder.

1328
00:48:57,075 --> 00:48:59,025
When Planet of the Apps launched,

1329
00:48:59,025 --> 00:49:02,108
and I was taking pictures with
those three famous people,

1330
00:49:02,108 --> 00:49:03,090
I went into that folder

1331
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:05,634
and read all the things
I made mistakes of.

1332
00:49:05,634 --> 00:49:08,679
I love reminding myself
about those things.

1333
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:09,530
It matters.

1334
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:10,389
It's super interesting to me.

1335
00:49:10,389 --> 00:49:12,024
You know, you start talking to,

1336
00:49:12,024 --> 00:49:13,193
you start looking at the world,

1337
00:49:13,193 --> 00:49:16,163
there's a lot of arbitrages coming, man.

1338
00:49:16,163 --> 00:49:17,870
It's really interesting out there,

1339
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:19,221
and like as social norms change,

1340
00:49:19,221 --> 00:49:21,204
the thing I'm most fascinated by

1341
00:49:21,204 --> 00:49:25,031
is how online dating went from
you are the weirdest nerd,

1342
00:49:25,031 --> 00:49:27,698
like what, to the absolute norm.

1343
00:49:31,183 --> 00:49:33,940
I can't believe how many well off people

1344
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,791
would much rather have
their 14 year old daughter

1345
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:39,631
go into strange men cars every day,

1346
00:49:39,631 --> 00:49:41,570
versus drive themselves.

1347
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:42,922
I mean, if I sat here 15 years ago,

1348
00:49:42,922 --> 00:49:44,183
and said I'm gonna make you one promise,

1349
00:49:44,183 --> 00:49:45,591
because I like in the future,

1350
00:49:45,591 --> 00:49:47,884
all of you are gonna think it's more safe

1351
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:49,313
for your 12 year old daughter to go into

1352
00:49:49,313 --> 00:49:52,737
a stranger's car every day than to drive,

1353
00:49:52,737 --> 00:49:54,726
you know, but that's our norm.

1354
00:49:54,726 --> 00:49:58,103
People of wealth send their
kids on Ubers all day long,

1355
00:49:58,103 --> 00:50:02,641
and so I think there's
growth in that category.

1356
00:50:02,641 --> 00:50:06,097
I think there's a lot of growth
in the ability of people,

1357
00:50:06,097 --> 00:50:07,574
arbitrage, Sawdust,

1358
00:50:07,574 --> 00:50:10,154
AWS, there's a lot of empty homes.

1359
00:50:10,154 --> 00:50:11,400
Right?

1360
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,647
- [Scarlet] This gentleman here.

1361
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:13,761
- Everyone has one.

1362
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:14,655
Well, not everyone has one,

1363
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,488
but you know what I mean.

1364
00:50:15,488 --> 00:50:16,837
There's a lot of fuckin' empty homes.

1365
00:50:16,837 --> 00:50:18,787
There's just a lot of empty homes, bro,

1366
00:50:18,787 --> 00:50:20,902
and a lot of empty a lot of things.

1367
00:50:20,902 --> 00:50:23,636
Lot of sawdust left to go.

1368
00:50:23,636 --> 00:50:25,298
- [Audience Member Two]
How you doing, Gary?

1369
00:50:25,298 --> 00:50:26,261
- That voice is incredible.

1370
00:50:26,261 --> 00:50:27,696
(Scarlet and audience laugh)

1371
00:50:27,696 --> 00:50:29,377
Have you thought about
monetizing your voice?

1372
00:50:29,377 --> 00:50:30,466
That's incredible.

1373
00:50:30,466 --> 00:50:31,721
- [Audience Member Two]
Yeah, I'm a speaker.

1374
00:50:31,721 --> 00:50:32,554
- What's that?

1375
00:50:32,554 --> 00:50:33,387
- [Audience Member Two] I'm a speaker.

1376
00:50:33,387 --> 00:50:34,220
- [Gary] Love it, it's a great voice.

1377
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:35,053
Go ahead.

1378
00:50:35,053 --> 00:50:38,241
- If you can give me two power
moves to consumer attention,

1379
00:50:38,241 --> 00:50:41,925
because you have basically
mastered the art of video,

1380
00:50:41,925 --> 00:50:44,355
everybody and their mother watches you,

1381
00:50:44,355 --> 00:50:46,784
so if you give me two power moves

1382
00:50:46,784 --> 00:50:49,673
that you can use in the next 24 hours

1383
00:50:49,673 --> 00:50:52,121
to getting consumer attention,

1384
00:50:52,121 --> 00:50:53,704
what would they be?

1385
00:50:54,987 --> 00:50:58,567
- I would become
disproportionally educated,

1386
00:50:58,567 --> 00:51:02,300
or start practicing very aggressively,

1387
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:05,182
in understanding how Facebook ads work.

1388
00:51:05,182 --> 00:51:07,686
Facebook ads are so good.

1389
00:51:07,686 --> 00:51:10,603
You can create long tail clusters

1390
00:51:10,603 --> 00:51:11,890
of 42 year old Latino women

1391
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:15,124
that like the New York Jets, okay?

1392
00:51:15,124 --> 00:51:16,791
Now go make a video.

1393
00:51:18,252 --> 00:51:21,489
Go make a Spanglish video about the Jets.

1394
00:51:21,489 --> 00:51:25,656
Like, the ability for the
micro target and scale, right?

1395
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,761
Like, you know,

1396
00:51:27,761 --> 00:51:29,954
I have a video that went berserko,

1397
00:51:29,954 --> 00:51:31,213
which was, it was basically,

1398
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,984
I was getting mad that no 44 year old

1399
00:51:33,984 --> 00:51:35,577
thought themselves as an entrepreneur.

1400
00:51:35,577 --> 00:51:37,700
Like, I was watching all
the 19 and 20 year olds

1401
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,582
with all these opportunities,

1402
00:51:38,582 --> 00:51:39,415
I was like, Jesus,

1403
00:51:39,415 --> 00:51:41,093
where are all the 40, 50, 60 year olds?

1404
00:51:41,093 --> 00:51:41,926
Like, have you heard?

1405
00:51:41,926 --> 00:51:43,434
You're gonna be living
longer that you think,

1406
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,353
like let's go get ours, right?

1407
00:51:44,353 --> 00:51:45,510
(Scarlet laughs)

1408
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:46,805
So I made that video,

1409
00:51:46,805 --> 00:51:50,659
and it went crazy because I
targeted 40 to 60 years olds

1410
00:51:50,659 --> 00:51:52,926
that watch Shark Tank.

1411
00:51:52,926 --> 00:51:55,694
You know, like there's so
much capability in that.

1412
00:51:55,694 --> 00:51:57,411
I also, you know,

1413
00:51:57,411 --> 00:51:59,321
look, I've got gift for gab,

1414
00:51:59,321 --> 00:52:01,573
you've got crazy voice, like you know,

1415
00:52:01,573 --> 00:52:02,959
you gotta be smart about that.

1416
00:52:02,959 --> 00:52:05,638
The first three seconds really matter.

1417
00:52:05,638 --> 00:52:07,474
The copy really matters.

1418
00:52:07,474 --> 00:52:09,162
The thumbnail really matters.

1419
00:52:09,162 --> 00:52:10,267
Everything matters.

1420
00:52:10,267 --> 00:52:11,256
I love how people think these people

1421
00:52:11,256 --> 00:52:15,434
that massed millions of
followers because they got lucky.

1422
00:52:15,434 --> 00:52:17,016
You know?

1423
00:52:17,016 --> 00:52:17,947
There's so much thought

1424
00:52:17,947 --> 00:52:19,438
that goes into what we do,

1425
00:52:19,438 --> 00:52:21,579
a lot of testing and learning,

1426
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:23,318
but Facebook video.

1427
00:52:23,318 --> 00:52:26,000
YouTube is hard to break out. Very.

1428
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,417
Facebook video, less hard,

1429
00:52:27,417 --> 00:52:29,251
especially if you have a
couple hundred bucks per video

1430
00:52:29,251 --> 00:52:31,374
to try to get it to go.

1431
00:52:31,374 --> 00:52:32,340
- [Scarlet] That's the first power move,

1432
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,979
what about the second power move?

1433
00:52:33,979 --> 00:52:35,593
- For video?

1434
00:52:35,593 --> 00:52:38,054
- [Audience Member Two] Yep.

1435
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:42,689
- Would you have interest
in people that are under 30?

1436
00:52:42,689 --> 00:52:44,008
- [Audience Member Two] I
want all of their attention.

1437
00:52:44,008 --> 00:52:44,841
- Respect.

1438
00:52:44,841 --> 00:52:46,173
(Scarlet and audience laugh)

1439
00:52:46,173 --> 00:52:48,506
His voice is so fuckin' rad.

1440
00:52:50,374 --> 00:52:53,382
Snapchat ads are grossly under priced.

1441
00:52:53,382 --> 00:52:56,421
$3 CPMs, they're watching a ton

1442
00:52:56,421 --> 00:52:57,616
of video once your ad comes in,

1443
00:52:57,616 --> 00:52:58,944
and you have to be very smart about

1444
00:52:58,944 --> 00:53:00,390
the first second to get them to swipe up,

1445
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:04,175
and you can't say because
Snapchat won't show it.

1446
00:53:04,175 --> 00:53:06,383
You can get an unbelievable percentage

1447
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:07,466
of people to watch three,

1448
00:53:07,466 --> 00:53:09,240
four minute videos in
a Snapchat environment

1449
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,433
if you can get them to snap swipe up,

1450
00:53:11,433 --> 00:53:16,173
and you can get the most
people under 30 for $3 CPMs.

1451
00:53:16,173 --> 00:53:17,378
- [Audience Member Two] All
right, I'm doing that tonight.

1452
00:53:17,378 --> 00:53:18,211
- You got it.

1453
00:53:18,211 --> 00:53:19,744
(Gary and audience laugh)

1454
00:53:19,744 --> 00:53:22,789
- [Scarlet] This lady over
here, with the blue top.

1455
00:53:22,789 --> 00:53:24,906
Right at the, yes.

1456
00:53:24,906 --> 00:53:26,315
Thank you.

1457
00:53:26,315 --> 00:53:27,784
- Hi, thank you.

1458
00:53:27,784 --> 00:53:29,102
My name is Kirstin Broderick,

1459
00:53:29,102 --> 00:53:31,853
and I founded a company
called North Scale,

1460
00:53:31,853 --> 00:53:32,790
which is all about EQ.

1461
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,970
I do executive corporate
and meditation training.

1462
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:35,803
- [Gary] Love it.

1463
00:53:35,803 --> 00:53:37,299
- So if anyone needs that,

1464
00:53:37,299 --> 00:53:39,814
and if you wanna be the next Gary,

1465
00:53:39,814 --> 00:53:40,959
come check me out.

1466
00:53:40,959 --> 00:53:43,029
- That was a good right hook.

1467
00:53:43,029 --> 00:53:43,862
- [Kirstin] Hey.

1468
00:53:43,862 --> 00:53:45,317
- Go ahead.

1469
00:53:45,317 --> 00:53:46,172
- [Kirstin] My question
for you is you said

1470
00:53:46,172 --> 00:53:48,176
that Amazon might just do the whole thing.

1471
00:53:48,176 --> 00:53:49,471
- Yeah.

1472
00:53:49,471 --> 00:53:50,413
- [Kirstin] And this
is a two part question.

1473
00:53:50,413 --> 00:53:51,246
- Yeah.

1474
00:53:51,246 --> 00:53:52,079
- [Kirstin] What does that mean?

1475
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:52,912
- Yup.

1476
00:53:52,912 --> 00:53:54,427
- And what does that
mean for the rest of us?

1477
00:53:54,427 --> 00:53:55,282
Not just the rest of us,

1478
00:53:55,282 --> 00:53:56,252
but the global economy,

1479
00:53:56,252 --> 00:53:59,538
the global society, the environment?

1480
00:53:59,538 --> 00:54:02,365
- What I think it means is
you think about the pillars,

1481
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:04,212
or at least he pillars I think about

1482
00:54:04,212 --> 00:54:05,643
when I talk about this kind of stuff,

1483
00:54:05,643 --> 00:54:07,393
retail, media, right?

1484
00:54:08,598 --> 00:54:09,696
Social.

1485
00:54:09,696 --> 00:54:13,495
Like, I'd be surprised if Amazon wasn't

1486
00:54:13,495 --> 00:54:16,604
in the social business with
a real play at some point.

1487
00:54:16,604 --> 00:54:19,036
So those are three pillars
that really matter to me,

1488
00:54:19,036 --> 00:54:19,869
that I think about.

1489
00:54:19,869 --> 00:54:22,150
Like, media in retail is big, right?

1490
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:24,787
If you think about how we live as a whole,

1491
00:54:24,787 --> 00:54:26,303
and I think that they,

1492
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:29,553
Google's retail, and Facebook's retail,

1493
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,755
everybody else's retail is so far behind,

1494
00:54:32,755 --> 00:54:34,495
it's nonexistent, right?

1495
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:38,022
Their ability to catch up in
media has been far quicker

1496
00:54:38,022 --> 00:54:39,866
than the other people into retail.

1497
00:54:39,866 --> 00:54:41,050
So you think about China where,

1498
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,377
full stack, they own it,

1499
00:54:42,377 --> 00:54:44,739
there's Communism dynamics there,

1500
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:45,914
which is why it's possible.

1501
00:54:45,914 --> 00:54:48,515
So anyway, I just basically
think any business

1502
00:54:48,515 --> 00:54:52,138
that Jeff Bazos wants to get into, he can.

1503
00:54:52,138 --> 00:54:52,971
I really believe that.

1504
00:54:52,971 --> 00:54:56,986
I really think he could
buy the Hilton Group.

1505
00:54:56,986 --> 00:55:00,746
Whole Foods is the preview,
not the anomaly, right?

1506
00:55:00,746 --> 00:55:02,162
So if he wants to,

1507
00:55:02,162 --> 00:55:03,770
and I don't know him at all,

1508
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:05,250
I don't know if his
space is more important

1509
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:08,469
than being considered the
greatest entrepreneur of a time,

1510
00:55:08,469 --> 00:55:11,267
what it means to all
of us is the following.

1511
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:14,711
There is a massive naivete
that we need government

1512
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:15,888
to protect this issue.

1513
00:55:15,888 --> 00:55:18,514
It's called innovation and capitalism.

1514
00:55:18,514 --> 00:55:20,582
First of all, Jeff Bazos is gonna die.

1515
00:55:20,582 --> 00:55:23,719
Second of all, if VR
comes out in 16 years,

1516
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:25,597
and hits full penetration,

1517
00:55:25,597 --> 00:55:28,568
if we're living in an
augmented world of VR,

1518
00:55:28,568 --> 00:55:30,506
AR, and real life,

1519
00:55:30,506 --> 00:55:31,868
well then the entire landscape

1520
00:55:31,868 --> 00:55:34,080
of VR opportunity becomes open,

1521
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,036
it's internet 1991.

1522
00:55:36,036 --> 00:55:38,928
Everything he's built gets arbitraged

1523
00:55:38,928 --> 00:55:41,458
if the way we actually want to live

1524
00:55:41,458 --> 00:55:42,698
is have protein pumped into us,

1525
00:55:42,698 --> 00:55:47,019
and everything we buy is
actually happening virtually.

1526
00:55:47,019 --> 00:55:48,149
So I think there's a naivete

1527
00:55:48,149 --> 00:55:50,899
that anybody's ever gonna rule the world.

1528
00:55:50,899 --> 00:55:52,514
I really do, I really believe that.

1529
00:55:52,514 --> 00:55:54,993
Now, that's just how I see it.

1530
00:55:54,993 --> 00:55:57,142
You know, nobody's shown
me in the history of time

1531
00:55:57,142 --> 00:55:57,975
that they're gonna be able

1532
00:55:57,975 --> 00:56:00,219
to capture everything and sustain it,

1533
00:56:00,219 --> 00:56:01,496
because they get fat

1534
00:56:01,496 --> 00:56:04,084
and innovation kills them, not government.

1535
00:56:04,084 --> 00:56:05,763
That's how I see it.

1536
00:56:05,763 --> 00:56:08,512
- Gentleman standing in the back.

1537
00:56:08,512 --> 00:56:09,825
- I mean look, for example real quick,

1538
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:11,147
just to put it into context,

1539
00:56:11,147 --> 00:56:14,358
I don't think it's ever been
a better time to be in retail.

1540
00:56:14,358 --> 00:56:15,878
Just go direct to consumer.

1541
00:56:15,878 --> 00:56:18,576
Amazon's got nothing to do with you,

1542
00:56:18,576 --> 00:56:20,311
and then people cry, you know,

1543
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:21,499
Amazon's too powerful.

1544
00:56:21,499 --> 00:56:22,668
Don't sell it on Amazon.

1545
00:56:22,668 --> 00:56:23,894
You loved it when it got you

1546
00:56:23,894 --> 00:56:26,653
from zero to five million, right?

1547
00:56:26,653 --> 00:56:28,122
But now you're crying,

1548
00:56:28,122 --> 00:56:29,344
but how'd you get there?

1549
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,330
So get in there, get what
you want, take it out.

1550
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:34,684
Facebook, all these media
companies cry about Facebook.

1551
00:56:34,684 --> 00:56:36,017
Take people out.

1552
00:56:37,012 --> 00:56:38,737
People just aren't smart.

1553
00:56:38,737 --> 00:56:39,570
(audience laughs)

1554
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,291
Really, like all these media companies

1555
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:42,695
crying about Facebook.

1556
00:56:42,695 --> 00:56:45,179
Make all your content as a
customer acquisition model,

1557
00:56:45,179 --> 00:56:48,262
and then put them in your own bucket.

1558
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,373
- Sounds so easy.

1559
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,287
- It is easy, it's that,

1560
00:56:52,287 --> 00:56:54,647
once again, people that work in companies

1561
00:56:54,647 --> 00:56:56,105
are not incentivized the right way,

1562
00:56:56,105 --> 00:56:58,047
and it's just human behavior.

1563
00:56:58,047 --> 00:56:58,880
The end.

1564
00:57:00,088 --> 00:57:00,921
- Hey, Gary.

1565
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:01,754
Thanks for coming.

1566
00:57:01,754 --> 00:57:03,367
My name's Rob Fajardo,

1567
00:57:03,367 --> 00:57:05,131
I founded a community
called Leave Normal Behind.

1568
00:57:05,131 --> 00:57:06,009
- [Gary] Great.

1569
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:08,059
- Travel around, bunch
of different places,

1570
00:57:08,059 --> 00:57:09,016
and one of the questions I have for you

1571
00:57:09,016 --> 00:57:10,951
is as a Millennial,

1572
00:57:10,951 --> 00:57:13,148
being 23, your being 41,

1573
00:57:13,148 --> 00:57:16,685
how have you found the
ability to bridge generations,

1574
00:57:16,685 --> 00:57:19,289
and the personalities of
all those generations,

1575
00:57:19,289 --> 00:57:21,788
when it comes to assembling
a team for business.

1576
00:57:21,788 --> 00:57:26,632
- Yeah. First, by not
believing all the propaganda

1577
00:57:26,632 --> 00:57:30,076
about generational
behavior has been the way,

1578
00:57:30,076 --> 00:57:31,266
by one by one.

1579
00:57:31,266 --> 00:57:34,120
I know plenty of 41 year
old entitled lazy people,

1580
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,551
and I know plenty of Millennials that

1581
00:57:35,551 --> 00:57:37,973
are working their fucking faces off.

1582
00:57:37,973 --> 00:57:39,197
One by one.

1583
00:57:39,197 --> 00:57:40,391
- [Rob] So just execution?

1584
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:41,224
- One by one.

1585
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:42,057
- [Rob] Cool.

1586
00:57:42,057 --> 00:57:43,229
- Right? I make no assumptions.

1587
00:57:43,229 --> 00:57:46,251
Like the thought that
Millennials are entitled

1588
00:57:46,251 --> 00:57:48,412
and any lazier than all my lazy buddies

1589
00:57:48,412 --> 00:57:49,245
that I grew up with?

1590
00:57:49,245 --> 00:57:50,189
No shot.

1591
00:57:50,189 --> 00:57:51,022
You know what I mean?

1592
00:57:51,022 --> 00:57:53,553
I think it's convenient talk, right?

1593
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:56,470
I think your generation's the best.

1594
00:57:57,332 --> 00:57:59,047
I think you're the most advanced socially,

1595
00:57:59,047 --> 00:58:00,031
this, that, and the other thing.

1596
00:58:00,031 --> 00:58:02,387
Do I think a ton of you
got eighth place trophies?

1597
00:58:02,387 --> 00:58:04,797
Yes, and do I think that
that's why most likely

1598
00:58:04,797 --> 00:58:06,508
it's harder for your to beat me?

1599
00:58:06,508 --> 00:58:07,341
Yes, I believe that,

1600
00:58:07,341 --> 00:58:09,733
but not all of you got
eighth place trophies.

1601
00:58:09,733 --> 00:58:11,726
I mean, there was entitled
kids in other generations too.

1602
00:58:11,726 --> 00:58:13,506
So it's about strengths and weaknesses.

1603
00:58:13,506 --> 00:58:16,448
I think the biggest
undercurrent for the youth

1604
00:58:16,448 --> 00:58:19,102
is losing is a very good thing,

1605
00:58:19,102 --> 00:58:21,860
and we, the parents of these kids,

1606
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,283
try to protect too much,

1607
00:58:23,283 --> 00:58:25,109
which has really hurt.

1608
00:58:25,109 --> 00:58:27,226
That's where America's vulnerable.

1609
00:58:27,226 --> 00:58:30,230
Like at scale, the political correctness

1610
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:34,901
of winning and losing is a
fundamentally dangerous thing,

1611
00:58:34,901 --> 00:58:37,755
a lot more than I think people think.

1612
00:58:37,755 --> 00:58:41,496
Losing matters, and if
you don't get that gear,

1613
00:58:41,496 --> 00:58:43,376
you're in deep shit,

1614
00:58:43,376 --> 00:58:46,295
and entitlement is a real issue.

1615
00:58:46,295 --> 00:58:48,075
- [Scarlet] You're gonna
lose early and young.

1616
00:58:48,075 --> 00:58:49,185
- God, losing matters guys,

1617
00:58:49,185 --> 00:58:51,373
like fuck, if you're a modern parent,

1618
00:58:51,373 --> 00:58:53,158
and you're trying to protect that feeling,

1619
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:54,496
you're being selfish.

1620
00:58:54,496 --> 00:58:56,097
You don't like seeing your kid upset,

1621
00:58:56,097 --> 00:58:57,514
I get it, I have them,

1622
00:58:57,514 --> 00:59:00,928
it sucks, but you better
fuckin' get out of the way,

1623
00:59:00,928 --> 00:59:02,265
because you're fucking it up,

1624
00:59:02,265 --> 00:59:03,625
because when you think you've won

1625
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:05,749
when you came in eighth
place, that's fine.

1626
00:59:05,749 --> 00:59:07,119
When you manipulated their grades,

1627
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:08,065
when you did their homework,

1628
00:59:08,065 --> 00:59:09,488
when you this that,

1629
00:59:09,488 --> 00:59:11,019
when you donated money,
and da da da da da,

1630
00:59:11,019 --> 00:59:12,126
when they get to the real world,

1631
00:59:12,126 --> 00:59:13,793
nobody gives a fuck,

1632
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:18,160
and that's the cliche, one thing,

1633
00:59:19,027 --> 00:59:21,561
that this younger generation has worse.

1634
00:59:21,561 --> 00:59:24,099
It's definitely got, as a whole,

1635
00:59:24,099 --> 00:59:25,887
as a macro, that's scary to me,

1636
00:59:25,887 --> 00:59:27,850
which is why I'm going so aggressive,

1637
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:28,683
because I have so much

1638
00:59:28,683 --> 00:59:30,695
of their attention
right now in this thing.

1639
00:59:30,695 --> 00:59:31,531
Like, it's good to lose,

1640
00:59:31,531 --> 00:59:32,471
I'm proud of my losses.

1641
00:59:32,471 --> 00:59:33,806
I am, I like it.

1642
00:59:33,806 --> 00:59:35,973
Notice how I talk about AirBnB,

1643
00:59:35,973 --> 00:59:36,837
like I want to bring up more,

1644
00:59:36,837 --> 00:59:37,961
I've got tons of shit.

1645
00:59:37,961 --> 00:59:39,729
I love losing.

1646
00:59:39,729 --> 00:59:41,610
I love the Jets, and the Knicks.

1647
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:44,007
I gave up on the Yankees and
Rangers because they won.

1648
00:59:44,007 --> 00:59:44,840
I mean it.

1649
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,512
It's a real thing.

1650
00:59:46,512 --> 00:59:48,069
I'm proud of my losses.

1651
00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:48,902
They're my losses.

1652
00:59:48,902 --> 00:59:50,893
What's your losses?

1653
00:59:50,893 --> 00:59:51,955
You've all got them.

1654
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:54,349
Like this notion, and so that one

1655
00:59:54,349 --> 00:59:55,753
is big for everybody here.

1656
00:59:55,753 --> 00:59:56,586
You have to be proud.

1657
00:59:56,586 --> 00:59:58,458
I tried, at least.

1658
00:59:58,458 --> 01:00:01,030
People are O for O because
their too scared to lose.

1659
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,592
I'll go for my three for 17.

1660
01:00:03,592 --> 01:00:04,708
(audience laughs)

1661
01:00:04,708 --> 01:00:05,711
- [Rob] Thanks, Gary. Appreciate it.

1662
01:00:05,711 --> 01:00:06,544
- You got it, borther.

1663
01:00:06,544 --> 01:00:09,627
- [Scarlet] This gentleman over here.

1664
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:12,654
- [Dan] Thanks. Hi, Gary.

1665
01:00:12,654 --> 01:00:13,487
My name's Dan.

1666
01:00:13,487 --> 01:00:14,665
I'm an investor in New York.

1667
01:00:14,665 --> 01:00:15,498
- Awesome, man.

1668
01:00:15,498 --> 01:00:16,331
- [Dan] As a Millennial,

1669
01:00:16,331 --> 01:00:17,918
I wanna take umbrage with
one of your statements.

1670
01:00:17,918 --> 01:00:18,751
- Please.

1671
01:00:18,751 --> 01:00:20,840
- That I came in eighth
place and got a trophy.

1672
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,698
(Gary chuckles)

1673
01:00:21,698 --> 01:00:22,791
I actually came in ninth, and got a medal.

1674
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:24,014
(Gary and audience laugh)

1675
01:00:24,014 --> 01:00:25,431
- [Gary] Respect.

1676
01:00:26,777 --> 01:00:27,897
- So my question for you

1677
01:00:27,897 --> 01:00:30,147
is regarding executive compensation.

1678
01:00:30,147 --> 01:00:30,980
- [Gary] Yes.

1679
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,235
- You were saying that
when you pay people with,

1680
01:00:32,235 --> 01:00:34,209
I guess, two years investing compensation,

1681
01:00:34,209 --> 01:00:35,670
they focus on the next two years?

1682
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:36,503
- [Gary] Yes.

1683
01:00:36,503 --> 01:00:37,336
- If you were to pay them

1684
01:00:37,336 --> 01:00:39,027
in kind of longer term compensation,

1685
01:00:39,027 --> 01:00:41,080
what would you do to avoid

1686
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:44,472
them basically goofing
off for seven years,

1687
01:00:44,472 --> 01:00:47,587
and not really having anything
to keep them in check,

1688
01:00:47,587 --> 01:00:48,860
you know, and saying no no no,

1689
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:49,918
you gotta wait, you gotta wait,

1690
01:00:49,918 --> 01:00:51,497
it'll hit, it'll hit eventually?

1691
01:00:51,497 --> 01:00:52,912
- That's a great question.

1692
01:00:52,912 --> 01:00:56,099
I think that there's ways to find

1693
01:00:56,099 --> 01:00:58,519
a balance between those two probably.

1694
01:00:58,519 --> 01:00:59,487
I haven't really thought about it,.

1695
01:00:59,487 --> 01:01:02,060
Number two, I think that
there can be recourse.

1696
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:06,227
You can take away equity along
the way instead of salary,

1697
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,565
if they're goofing off for seven,

1698
01:01:08,565 --> 01:01:09,658
and make the big pay off in 10.

1699
01:01:09,658 --> 01:01:10,792
We have to.

1700
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:13,638
If the biggest companies in
the world want to survive,

1701
01:01:13,638 --> 01:01:15,543
and the problem is the
board's in the same game,

1702
01:01:15,543 --> 01:01:16,968
so there's no checks and balances,

1703
01:01:16,968 --> 01:01:17,984
but if they want to,

1704
01:01:17,984 --> 01:01:19,691
if somebody has a motion for it,

1705
01:01:19,691 --> 01:01:21,715
we're gonna have to make
these much longer things,

1706
01:01:21,715 --> 01:01:25,142
and I think a lot of you
are in the game, right?

1707
01:01:25,142 --> 01:01:26,762
There's a whole kind of
conversation it seems

1708
01:01:26,762 --> 01:01:28,467
with some of the Silicon Valley talk

1709
01:01:28,467 --> 01:01:29,679
of like different compensations,

1710
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:31,055
and different ways to go public.

1711
01:01:31,055 --> 01:01:33,534
I saw a headline, just haven't
started educating myself,

1712
01:01:33,534 --> 01:01:35,240
but it seemed that the energy,

1713
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,735
Eric Ries for Lean Startup,right?

1714
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:38,540
I saw something, I'm trying
to throw some stuff out,

1715
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:39,722
somebody says yeah or shakes their head,

1716
01:01:39,722 --> 01:01:40,555
(audience laughs)

1717
01:01:40,555 --> 01:01:41,617
but it seems like there seems

1718
01:01:41,617 --> 01:01:43,265
to be starting some early debate of like,

1719
01:01:43,265 --> 01:01:46,468
it's not fun to go public
for Blue Bottle, right?

1720
01:01:46,468 --> 01:01:47,859
It was the Blue Bottle conversation

1721
01:01:47,859 --> 01:01:49,592
that it seemed started some conversations.

1722
01:01:49,592 --> 01:01:51,528
Nonetheless, yeah,

1723
01:01:51,528 --> 01:01:52,699
we're gonna have to start figuring,

1724
01:01:52,699 --> 01:01:55,879
I think, big companies are
gonna have to start figuring out

1725
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:57,423
how to get into 10 year things,

1726
01:01:57,423 --> 01:01:58,486
and then the argument of like

1727
01:01:58,486 --> 01:02:00,358
then you're not gonna get the best talent,

1728
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:02,220
I think it's the other way around.

1729
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:04,540
You're not gonna get the best
talent by today's standards,

1730
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:07,625
which I think are career CEOs that suck,

1731
01:02:07,625 --> 01:02:09,900
that are doing everything for themselves.

1732
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:10,842
- [Dan] Cool. Thanks for the response.

1733
01:02:10,842 --> 01:02:11,793
- You got it. Thanks
for your questions, man.

1734
01:02:11,793 --> 01:02:13,751
- Final question.

1735
01:02:13,751 --> 01:02:15,179
This gentleman here.

1736
01:02:15,179 --> 01:02:16,012
- [Audience Member
Three] Hi, I just wanted

1737
01:02:16,012 --> 01:02:16,845
to follow up on that one.

1738
01:02:16,845 --> 01:02:18,214
- Please.

1739
01:02:18,214 --> 01:02:19,517
- [Audience Member Three]
Do you think other countries

1740
01:02:19,517 --> 01:02:21,795
are better than China,

1741
01:02:21,795 --> 01:02:24,864
either when it comes
to long term thinking.

1742
01:02:24,864 --> 01:02:26,838
Do you have concern that we're not,

1743
01:02:26,838 --> 01:02:30,565
as part of our global
competitive position?

1744
01:02:30,565 --> 01:02:32,864
- I'm not educated enough
to answer that question.

1745
01:02:32,864 --> 01:02:34,672
So that's the true answer.

1746
01:02:34,672 --> 01:02:36,033
I would just throw one thing,

1747
01:02:36,033 --> 01:02:38,216
as a boy that was born in communism,

1748
01:02:38,216 --> 01:02:40,016
you know, the China thing
is super fascinating.

1749
01:02:40,016 --> 01:02:41,339
I've run the gambit.

1750
01:02:41,339 --> 01:02:42,991
I've run the gambit of like,

1751
01:02:42,991 --> 01:02:45,170
we grossly underestimate communism,

1752
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:46,584
and like it's weaknesses,

1753
01:02:46,584 --> 01:02:49,315
but the more I think
about what China's doing,

1754
01:02:49,315 --> 01:02:53,098
China's actually running the whole thing

1755
01:02:53,098 --> 01:02:55,396
a lot more like business are run, right?

1756
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:57,077
Which is, it's a mix between dictatorship

1757
01:02:57,077 --> 01:02:59,343
and capitalism, right?

1758
01:02:59,343 --> 01:03:01,150
Like, there is an ultimate
collar at the top.

1759
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:02,813
Like, it's really interesting.

1760
01:03:02,813 --> 01:03:04,618
It's been the theme in my
head the last six months.

1761
01:03:04,618 --> 01:03:06,088
I'm like, wait a minute.

1762
01:03:06,088 --> 01:03:09,027
You know, China runs China a hell

1763
01:03:09,027 --> 01:03:10,638
of a lot more like a successful,

1764
01:03:10,638 --> 01:03:12,517
like Bezos runs Amazon,

1765
01:03:12,517 --> 01:03:14,510
than the way we run America,

1766
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:16,828
which is like, oh shit, you know?

1767
01:03:16,828 --> 01:03:18,336
You know, it's super fascinating,

1768
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:19,568
so I don't know.

1769
01:03:19,568 --> 01:03:20,818
I really don't,

1770
01:03:26,147 --> 01:03:28,761
but I genuinely believe intuitively

1771
01:03:28,761 --> 01:03:31,702
that we are all very lucky,

1772
01:03:31,702 --> 01:03:33,262
because I think we're gonna live through

1773
01:03:33,262 --> 01:03:36,720
some really interesting times
over the next 20 to 40 years.

1774
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,449
I think a lot of people hearing that

1775
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:42,440
just exposed themselves to themselves.

1776
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,525
Let me explain.

1777
01:03:43,525 --> 01:03:44,582
If you just heard that,

1778
01:03:44,582 --> 01:03:46,111
and you thought that was bad,

1779
01:03:46,111 --> 01:03:48,956
that means that you're a
pessimist and you're on defense,

1780
01:03:48,956 --> 01:03:50,425
and if you heard that and
you thought it was awesome,

1781
01:03:50,425 --> 01:03:52,598
it means you're an
optimist and on offense,

1782
01:03:52,598 --> 01:03:54,827
and I think most people
are defense and pessimist,

1783
01:03:54,827 --> 01:03:57,221
and I think that optimism,

1784
01:03:57,221 --> 01:03:59,243
and gratitude, and empathy

1785
01:03:59,243 --> 01:04:01,979
are the ingredients of the future winners,

1786
01:04:01,979 --> 01:04:06,027
and so I'm glad my parents gave me that.

1787
01:04:06,027 --> 01:04:07,293
- All right, Gary Vaynerchuk.

1788
01:04:07,293 --> 01:04:08,437
Thank you so much for joining us.

1789
01:04:08,437 --> 01:04:10,269
(audience applause).

1790
01:04:10,269 --> 01:04:11,267
- Hope you guys enjoyed that.

1791
01:04:11,267 --> 01:04:13,347
Question of the day before I sign off

1792
01:04:13,347 --> 01:04:15,444
and send you on your way,

1793
01:04:15,444 --> 01:04:17,238
what was the biggest insight

1794
01:04:17,238 --> 01:04:20,178
that you got from the talk you just saw.

1795
01:04:20,178 --> 01:04:22,523
I promise, I'm gonna read all 500,

1796
01:04:22,523 --> 01:04:23,838
600, 700 comments,

1797
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:25,705
because this is the
insight I'm looking for.

1798
01:04:25,705 --> 01:04:28,610
So honest truths, what
was the biggest take away

1799
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:30,189
from the talk that you just saw?

1800
01:04:30,189 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat electronic music)
