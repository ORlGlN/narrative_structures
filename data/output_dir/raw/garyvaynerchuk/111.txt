where would you like to be dropped off at.

8
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:40,887
Somewhere over here--

- [Kyle] It's around here.

10
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,107
I think it's like some sort of cafe.

11

something that has been

18
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:13,574
dinging my phone left and right

that this may be the video that

22
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:21,651
changes your mindset.

23
00:01:21,651 --> 00:01:22,836
Just a quick little rant.

24
00:01:22,836 --> 00:01:24,790
It's called Fuckin' Permission.

25
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,818
Like who the hell's permission

26
00:01:26,818 --> 00:01:28,823
are you looking for to do your thing?

27
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:30,764
Like who is this person?

28
00:01:30,764 --> 00:01:32,387
Is it your mom?

29
00:01:32,387 --> 00:01:33,575
Is it society?

30
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:34,714
Is it your partner?

31
00:01:34,714 --> 00:01:37,776
Is it the people that are
commenting in your social media?

32
00:01:37,776 --> 00:01:41,256
Is it something that happened
to you when you were nine?

33
00:01:41,256 --> 00:01:43,238
What permission are you looking for?

34
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:44,994
I'm just so tired of you know,

35
00:01:44,994 --> 00:01:47,073
so many people are using me right now

36
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,464
to give them permission to do stuff

37
00:01:48,464 --> 00:01:49,564
that it is my literally,

38
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:51,952
my literally greatest feeling of my life.

39
00:01:51,952 --> 00:01:54,241
The feeling that I, through my content

40
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:56,409
every day on Instagram or my podcast,

41
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:58,882
am giving you permission to win

42
00:01:58,882 --> 00:02:00,099
excites the shit out of me.

43
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:02,446
But my friends, and I
can't even like contain it,

44
00:02:02,446 --> 00:02:05,545
very simply, like, can
you answer this for me?

45
00:02:05,545 --> 00:02:07,789
Whose fuckin' permission
are you looking for?

46
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:08,987
Go do your thing.

50
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,478
Something great is gonna happen.

51
00:02:15,478 --> 00:02:17,826
But most of all, nothing's gonna happen

52
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:18,952
unless you do something.

53
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:21,193
Please stop looking for permission.

54
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:23,497
Please go do that thing you wanted to do.

55
00:02:23,497 --> 00:02:24,763
Ask that person out.

56
00:02:24,763 --> 00:02:26,002
Start that company.

57
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:28,115
Quit that fuckin' bullshit job.

58
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,382
You can always get another bullshit job.

59
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:31,900
Stop asking for permission.

61

Hey, live from the streets of New York.

Hey vlog, I know today's gonna be

66
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:02,121
a little bit of a short episode.

67
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:04,473
I was even taking my mic off
hence why I'm holding it,

68
00:03:04,473 --> 00:03:06,728
but you're about to
see me walk into WeWork

69
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,608
and I thought, you know
between the rant I just did

70
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:10,895
which I'm sure will be in
there and some of the B-roll,

71
00:03:10,895 --> 00:03:13,394
I'm sure Kyle will chop it up proper.

72
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:14,231
Obviously this is a day when

73
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:15,977
most of the world is traveling.

74
00:03:15,977 --> 00:03:17,864
This is the Wednesday before Thanksgiving,

75
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,427
favorite day 'cause I love when the world

76
00:03:19,427 --> 00:03:21,938
is shut out and shut down.

77
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:23,526
I feel like I'm productive 'cause you know

78
00:03:23,526 --> 00:03:25,396
I hate when everybody's
working when I'm not

79
00:03:25,396 --> 00:03:27,141
but I love working when
everybody else isn't.

80
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:29,562
Anyway, going into WeWork
I thought to extend

81
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:31,334
the vlog's quality here.

82
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:33,896
What WeWork tapped into is
just rethinking the world.

83
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:35,895
You know like, why do you have
to work in your home office?

84
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:39,124
Why do you have to work
and rent a five year lease?

85
00:03:39,124 --> 00:03:41,920
They took advantage of a retail arbitrage

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,913
and a community and a brand
that a lot of people haven't

87
00:03:44,913 --> 00:03:46,166
and so as I'm thinking about voice

88
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,454
and I'm thinking about virtual reality,

89
00:03:47,454 --> 00:03:51,469
I'm thinking about AR and cryptocurrency.

90
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:53,899
You know, we've lived
through the search era.

91
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:57,082
We're in the midst of
the social content era

92
00:03:57,082 --> 00:03:58,170
but for all you 20 year olds,

93
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,827
please start thinking
about the other trends.

94
00:03:59,827 --> 00:04:01,934
Every industry is about to be disrupted.

95
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:04,746
Retail at an all-time
low here in New York.

96
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:05,874
As a matter of fact, back to WeWork,

97
00:04:05,874 --> 00:04:09,077
they just took over the
Lord and Taylor building,

98
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:10,020
it hasn't happened yet but that's where

99
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,566
our headquarters is going.

100
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:12,915
Lord and Taylor are an iconic retail

101
00:04:12,915 --> 00:04:14,081
that's been here for 100 years.

102
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:15,582
Point to Old Navy right now.

103
00:04:15,582 --> 00:04:17,644
I'm gonna just make a
very simple prediction.

104
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:20,329
That Old Navy being there, right,

105
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:24,521
the likelihood of that in
seven years is quite low.

106
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:25,354
Why?

107
00:04:25,354 --> 00:04:27,653
Because more of us are
buying on the internet.

108
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:30,910
Like why are we spending $6 on coffee

109
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,297
like this young lady just did at Fika?

110
00:04:33,297 --> 00:04:35,247
It's $6 coffee.

111
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:36,080
$6 coffee.

112
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,126
Go tell your grandfather people
pay six bucks for coffee.

113
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:40,156
What are the next things?

114
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:41,114
Meditation.

115
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,288
Obsessed, thinks it's
gonna be a huge space.

Please use this short
episode and this rant as well

117
00:04:46,863 --> 00:04:47,813
to rethink the game.

118
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:48,833
Why can an entrepreneur,

119
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,077
show your shoes Kyle.

120
00:04:50,077 --> 00:04:53,539
Why can an entrepreneur
sell out of sneakers

121
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:55,670
in 11 hours and break a website?

122
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,793
I'm not a rapper, I'm not an athlete.

123
00:04:57,793 --> 00:04:59,218
Oh, maybe it's 'cause entrepreneurship

124
00:04:59,218 --> 00:05:00,324
is being put on a pedestal.

125
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:02,876
Maybe nerd culture is taking over.

126
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:03,736
All these things.

watch, we have three year olds

00:05:23,745 --> 00:05:25,770

136
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,680
that people put up on
Twitter, you'll find it.

138
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:36,251
And the Knicks are coming
back, that's the 14th--

139
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:40,418
- I'm sitting next a 72
year old man wearing Yeezys.

141
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,580
72 year old in 2018 is not the same as

142
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,986
a 72 year old in 1998.

143

Say hello.

148
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,307
Ask questions.

149
00:05:55,307 --> 00:05:58,920
Understand why people are
wearing backpacks, right.

150
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,138
Understand what this
world is doing right now.

151
00:06:02,138 --> 00:06:03,707
