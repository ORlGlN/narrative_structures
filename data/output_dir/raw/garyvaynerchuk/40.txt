1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,360
- I'm starting my vlog today, solo.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,700
8:58 in the morning.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,370
Had somebody cancel so,

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,470
me and Iris are on different schedules.

5
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,684
Pullin' up to the office, good day.

6
00:00:10,684 --> 00:00:14,010
Got Nightline following me around today.

7
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,550
So I'm excited about that, so

8
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,880
some of your grandparents and parents

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,830
are gonna check that out

10
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,880
on the 'television'.

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,140
You'll see that online.

12
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,160
I will chop it up.

13
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,180
Super excited, all great stuff.

14
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,700
Focused, VaynerMedia.

15
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,729
Just the Vayner X family, PureWow

16
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,420
all that is going extremely well.

17
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,250
Tons of strategies for
2018 being implemented,

18
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,709
super excited for Agent 2021 our first

19
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:42,960
owned and operated conference

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,220
in Miami next week.

21
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,330
That should be great and
obviously the book is

22
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,340
right upon us, obviously.

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,940
Super excited about 'Crushing It'.

24
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,850
It's doing extremely well in sales

25
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,120
which I appreciate.

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,350
YouTube, YouTube, YouTube

27
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,550
if you have not pre-ordered it,

28
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,080
now is the time.

29
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,087
Don't break my heart.

30
00:01:02,087 --> 00:01:04,754
(hip hop music)

31
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,633
You know,

32
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:43,570
what a lot of people
don't understand about

33
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,170
raising capital is

34
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,930
you just need somebody to say yes.

35
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,930
It's not about, here's how you do it.

36
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,301
You

37
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:53,890
There's seven people
running around right now

38
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,160
that love coffee and tattoo

39
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,810
and there's a tattoo artist who's

40
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,460
grandfather left him or her

41
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,100
a million dollars and they're trying to

42
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,550
figure out where to spend it.

43
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,500
Those people exist.

44
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,729
Like, you're not gonna go to Silicon

45
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:07,997
The reason everyone's losing is

46
00:02:07,997 --> 00:02:10,359
they want to go to Silicon
Valley and talk to bankers

47
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:14,502
and math kids, and they
run you through the ringer

48
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:15,960
and it's a waste of time.

49
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,090
You need to find entrepreneurial money

50
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,210
who believe in you.

51
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,880
You need to go find somebody
who sold their agency

52
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,492
and has $12 million dollars now

53
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:26,280
and is looking to do something

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,510
and it's like, oh I understand Mike and

55
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,230
I love skateboarding and tattoos and

56
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,063
I love,

57
00:02:31,063 --> 00:02:31,896
do you understand?

58
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:34,197
So, I'm giving you a piece of advice that

59
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:37,030
people are just not understanding.

60
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,863
That's the game.

61
00:02:37,863 --> 00:02:40,990
You don't go to somebody
who's gonna say no.

62
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,030
And that's what every artist

63
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,052
every creative entrepreneur
is doing right now

64
00:02:46,052 --> 00:02:48,250
and it's a complete waste of time.

65
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,260
Raising capital, it's

66
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,450
so many of you have gotten caught in this

67
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,716
bullshit venture capital
and banking world.

68
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,780
When you need money,

69
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,950
you gotta be willing to
get it in any shape or form

70
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,260
as long as it's clean money

71
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,892
and as long as the person
you're getting from isn't

72
00:03:01,892 --> 00:03:05,145
going to put you emotionally
in a bad place, right?

73
00:03:05,145 --> 00:03:07,900
You don't want to get money from your aunt

74
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,733
who's then gonna

75
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:10,201
text you 15 times a day and say

76
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:11,500
you suck!

77
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,333
You know,

78
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,810
that brings in too much family dynamics

79
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,643
but nonetheless,

80
00:03:14,643 --> 00:03:15,780
what I mean by that is

81
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,930
everybody's trying to fit into the mold of

82
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,730
how to sell to a venture capitalist,

83
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,610
when that's like a moonshot.

84
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,487
Instead of trying to find
high net worth individuals

85
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:26,230
who believe in your vision like

86
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,650
I've never made

87
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,610
I've written

88
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,420
millions of dollars in
checks in my career.

89
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,180
And it's never been because of the math

90
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,750
and then other people
have never written a check

91
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,860
that hasn't been about the math

92
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,980
and neither is right or wrong.

93
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,813
It's about styles and so

94
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:44,401
but too many of you have
no chance of getting

95
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:47,730
silicon valley venture capital firm

96
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,670
to write you a check.

97
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,870
And all you do is you
sit and you make excuses,

98
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,690
'I didn't go to a good college' or

99
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,920
'I don't look the part' or

100
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,290
'They don't invest in minorities'

101
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,010
or whatever you may come up with

102
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,810
instead of going to who
will give you money.

103
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,815
Find who will give you money.

104
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:06,030
High net worth individuals who are

105
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,512
creative and open minded.

106
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:09,480
Find them.

107
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,256
I'm super okay.

108
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:46,089
(laughs)

109
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:48,916
- [Female] And you've time to speak with

110
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:49,749
Jarvis.

111
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:50,582
- Looking forward to it.

112
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:51,415
- [Female] In this office later.

113
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:52,248
- Looking forward to it.

114
00:04:52,248 --> 00:04:53,081
- [Female] Cool.

115
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:53,914
- Hey!

116
00:04:53,914 --> 00:04:54,747
- Let's do it.

117
00:04:54,747 --> 00:04:56,110
So these ladies flew from Australia.

118
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,130
- Thank you.

119
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:57,963
- For you!

120
00:04:57,963 --> 00:04:58,796
- Thank you.
- For you!

121
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:00,394
What kind of teenage were you?

122
00:05:00,394 --> 00:05:02,110
- I was a great teenager.

123
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:02,943
My mom

124
00:05:02,943 --> 00:05:04,570
I'm writing a book called
Perfectly Parented.

125
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,902
So it's interesting to hear what you guys

126
00:05:05,902 --> 00:05:06,735
- [Both] Wow!

127
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:07,610
- This is awesome!

128
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,870
- So I'm writing a book
called Perfectly Parented.

129
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,320
And it's the perspective
of a kid who feels

130
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,710
his parents perfectly parented him.

131
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,250
My mom and dad

132
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,920
so I never

133
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,300
did any, I mean I did nothing
wrong except get bad grades.

134
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,220
So I never disrespected anybody,

135
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,700
I never did cliche
drugs and alcohol stuff.

136
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,070
I was the nicest kid,

137
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,910
I was friends with
everybody in my high school,

138
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,580
I worked every minute.

139
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,280
I went to like seven high
school parties in my life.

140
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,260
I just worked, I helped around the house

141
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,820
'cause I was the oldest.

142
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,830
I was a ridiculously good kid, yet

143
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,310
I wasn't like a square, meaning

144
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,846
I had fun, I enjoyed it,

145
00:05:49,846 --> 00:05:52,130
my high school years were very simple.

146
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,649
I worked every minute,

147
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:55,880
which was the happiest moments of my time

148
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,720
whether it was doing baseball card shows,

149
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,810
selling at flea markets or
working at my dad's liquor store.

150
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,940
Or, I

151
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,370
was in school being miserable.

152
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,280
I didn't play sports, I
played tennis for two years

153
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,170
but I barely played sports.

154
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,230
I didn't chase girls for the most part,

155
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,406
I just was very focused
on being an entrepreneur

156
00:06:15,406 --> 00:06:18,390
from a very young age,
and I was obsessed with

157
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,080
not making my mom upset.

158
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:22,676
- I love it.

159
00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:23,511
(laughs)

160
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:25,530
Saying as I'm a mom.

161
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,473
- It's just true.

162
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:28,306
Like, I

163
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:32,550
my mom guilted me into
being a great child,

164
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,760
and a great teenager and
I think that's what I do

165
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,860
to my employees.

166
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,693
- How, how?

167
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:40,450
- By providing so much love and support

168
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,890
that the fear is letting them down.

169
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,550
Guilting.

170
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,010
Iris was going to leave after working

171
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,550
for a year, that was her plan.

172
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,780
That was her thoughts.

173
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,060
But she's still here because
it's better to be here

174
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,730
than it's not to be here.

175
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,330
- Well, a lot of teenagers
actually disconnect

176
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,540
from their parents.

177
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,620
- Because their parents are screwing up!

178
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,640
Their parents are doing the wrong thing.

179
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,000
Their parents care about
themselves, not their kids.

180
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,110
Parents are struggling out there because

181
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,521
they're insecure, and they're
parenting their children

182
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:11,830
based on the judgment of other parents

183
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,460
not based on the putting their kids in the

184
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,848
position to succeed.

185
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:16,584
(reflective piano)

186
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:17,584
- I understand that.

187
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,510
Get me on the phone with
them for five minutes.

188
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:41,080
- I got to figure it out, anyways

189
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,810
when we started basically

190
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,789
a digital agency

191
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:45,530
- [Gary V] When was that?

192
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,480
- This is like late

193
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,970
middle of 2016.

194
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,060
- [Gary V] 'kay.

195
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,010
- And, I mean it's just
straight to the fire.

196
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:54,843
- [Gary V] Yep.

197
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:56,010
- And I had no problem with that,

198
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,470
like that's where I think I thrive.

199
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,120
Took us a little bit of time to figure out

200
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,080
what our niche was

201
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,870
and then once we figure that out and

202
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,140
it's been a really, it's
been incredible like

203
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,450
I have, we have a team of six.

204
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,390
Space in the city, I mean, typical stuff.

205
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,540
Trying to make it happen
- [Gary V] Yep, yep.

206
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,019
- With what we can.

207
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:18,540
I guess one of the main things that I'm

208
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,040
running up against now is like

209
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,773
I need to scale.

210
00:08:22,773 --> 00:08:25,050
I need a couple more people.

211
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,160
I need to be able to do
certain things that I'm doing.

212
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,074
- [Gary V] There's only
two ways to do that.

213
00:08:31,074 --> 00:08:33,510
It's a chicken and egg game.

214
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,980
You either go out and get

215
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,669
enough business that
allows you to afford it,

216
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,959
or you convince people
to work for you for free,

217
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,430
because you know that
you're a good enough guy

218
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,750
that when you can make it whole,

219
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,130
you will.

220
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,410
- [Man] Okay, that makes sense.

221
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,960
- But there's a ton of
22 year old you and me

222
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,800
and Boyds and Iris's.

223
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,880
There's a lot of them.

224
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,290
There's just a lot of kids who are 22

225
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,920
who want to fuck with you,

226
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,180
you just have to create the net.

227
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,817
So, you have to start.

228
00:09:07,817 --> 00:09:10,500
People are scared to ask
for people to work for free.

229
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,230
But you have to find
two people who are worth

230
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,180
a year that are willing
to work for $14 an hour.

231
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,230
'Cause you might have to pay minimum wage,

232
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,070
I don't know what the rules are.

233
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,450
- [Man] I for sure am scared to ask people

234
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,283
to work for free.

235
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:22,116
- Here's why.

236
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:22,949
Let me tell you,

237
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:23,782
I know, I know.

238
00:09:23,782 --> 00:09:25,780
Let me tell you the secret
of why I fuck with it.

239
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,550
Because I'm gonna pay them back more.

240
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,230
And I know I'm capable of.

241
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,380
And I know that if I wasn't capable of,

242
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,930
I would die to the end.

243
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,200
If this went bankrupt because
there was fraud going on,

244
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,300
and I owed a lot, six of them dollars,

245
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,350
well that's what I would work on

246
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,465
until I would start up again.

247
00:09:44,465 --> 00:09:47,210
The biggest reason people
are scared to ask people

248
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,950
to work for free is they think
it's doing the wrong thing

249
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,530
and I think it's doing the right thing.

250
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,500
There's a lot of street kids

251
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,520
who are not going to NYU,

252
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,550
who are going to a community college that

253
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,890
no agency wants to hire 'cause they're

254
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,200
hiring from better schools

255
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,940
who you'll fuck with

256
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,240
and they'll fuck with you.

257
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,380
You might have to kiss some frogs

258
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,526
when you get free you get
what you pay for sometimes.

259
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:13,277
But, I

260
00:10:13,277 --> 00:10:15,390
spoke for free.

261
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,526
I do stuff for free.

262
00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:21,160
I'm doing stuff for free, constantly.

263
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,110
I'm doing this meeting!

264
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,740
The fuck is this meeting for me?

265
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,970
- [Man] Yeah, that's
what I'm wondering too.

266
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,053
- Well I'm

267
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:27,730
(laughs)
this is my version of

268
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,570
working for free!

269
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,580
- I understand.

270
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,310
- People, when I talk
about working for free,

271
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,610
people love to come out
and fuckin' kill me.

272
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,041
I know what you guys are thinkin'!

273
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,510
They're just not as smart.

274
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,960
There's two people on earth right now

275
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,380
who can be a designer or an account person

276
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,230
or a media planner or
whatever the fuck you do,

277
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,210
who are willing to work for you,

278
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:50,250
for $15 because you told them at

279
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,149
a pop-up salad QSR for an hour that

280
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:55,568
you got them.

281
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:56,401
- Right.

282
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:58,010
- And they're gonna say,
you're brown like me too.

283
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,537
It's always the ones that look like you.

284
00:10:59,537 --> 00:11:00,971
You know,

285
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:04,050
kids that went to Yale, and went to MBAs

286
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,270
they don't fuck with me.

287
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,103
- Which is cool.

288
00:11:06,103 --> 00:11:07,370
- Until they break at 29.

289
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,197
Then they find me.

290
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:11,670
- So to give you a little bit
of background about myself

291
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,955
and how I got started,

292
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:15,360
I got into fitness in 2012,

293
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,400
kind of accidentally.

294
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,440
I was on my own journey,
experiencing health problems,

295
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,970
my journey is very much in fitness

296
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,647
more about the health side of things.

297
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:24,480
- Yep.

298
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,900
- And I joined Instagram
to motivate myself,

299
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,240
we were actually living
in China at the time.

300
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,800
And being alone on that journey

301
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,420
- Sure.
- Instagram was my way to

302
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,035
connect and communicate
- Of course, of course.

303
00:11:35,035 --> 00:11:35,911
- With people

304
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:36,744
- Especially back home, right?

305
00:11:36,744 --> 00:11:37,632
- Yeah, and

306
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:40,490
since that was really at
the beginning of Instagram

307
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,080
I started organically growing a page

308
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,050
just by connecting with people

309
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,740
- I know enough about your story

310
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,940
like I know enough about
that era of Instagram

311
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,580
to know that you were on
that wave, I remember.

312
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,413
- Yeah.

313
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,070
Okay, so fast forward to today,

314
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,791
pretty much I built this
brand kind of on accident

315
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,300
but it's been amazing.

316
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,830
Something that I'm passionate about

317
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,830
and I'm able to connect with people on and

318
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,610
I launched the app, December 17th.

319
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,450
So it's been just a few weeks

320
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,700
and so

321
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,610
the launch was great, my community

322
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,720
kind of just freaked out, exploded

323
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
and they're loving it.

324
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,670
I would just say that,
where we're at now is

325
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,690
we're a pretty small team.

326
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,110
We're a team of like, five.

327
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:26,110
And the demand is exceeding
our potential as a small team.

328
00:12:26,184 --> 00:12:30,146
- Well let me give you a
first big piece of advice.

329
00:12:30,146 --> 00:12:32,240
Try to keep less money.

330
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,460
- Keep less money.
(laughs)

331
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,293
- Of course.

332
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:36,200
- Invest more in the company.

333
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,510
- 100 percent.

334
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,360
Unless you're retiring next year,

335
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,270
the biggest mistake that
people that go through

336
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,540
what you're going through right now make

337
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,499
is they're trying to maximize profit

338
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:51,593
to buy the things that
the two of you want.

339
00:12:51,593 --> 00:12:52,426
- Yeah.

340
00:12:52,426 --> 00:12:53,259
Right.

341
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:57,590
- So they're willing to not
hire three more teammates

342
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,440
and invest in the business,

343
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,440
because they want an extra
vacation or a bigger bedroom

344
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,060
or three more handbags.

345
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,300
I mean that's real!

346
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,270
The biggest first piece
of advice I would make

347
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,946
is the following.

348
00:13:11,946 --> 00:13:13,207
There are, Ming, right?

349
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:14,040
- Minh.

350
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,873
- Minh, spell it?

351
00:13:14,873 --> 00:13:15,800
- M-i-n-h

352
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,690
- There are seven
thousand Minhs right now.

353
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,094
Do you know how pumped Minh is too?

354
00:13:19,094 --> 00:13:20,570
(laughs)

355
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,820
You have to understand how
this is all playing out.

356
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,320
Minh is a young woman, Alex

357
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,570
Iris

358
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,940
There are people who are under 25

359
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,334
Alex is way over 25.

360
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:32,255
(laughs)

361
00:13:32,255 --> 00:13:33,088
You are?

362
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:33,921
Wow, you look great.

363
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:36,150
But there's a lot of people right now,

364
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,580
there's an unbelievable amount of

365
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,480
talented 22 to 24 year olds,

366
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,020
who look up to you,

367
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,690
who are willing to work for very little.

368
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,220
You need to build out your team,

369
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,257
and take it out of your short term pocket

370
00:13:49,257 --> 00:13:52,140
to create long term success.

371
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,821
I get

372
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:57,200
40 emails a week, minimally of

373
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,870
I have an MBA,

374
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,700
I've been running a
business for four years,

375
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,330
I've made, forget about learned.

376
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,450
I've made more money
in the last six months

377
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,030
watching your vlog and
listening to your podcast

378
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,120
than I did the last six years
with all that background.

379
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,310
Because you have to understand,
this is of the moment.

380
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,540
The reason they're so

381
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,670
do you understand that
all of you in this room

382
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,180
don't realize how smart you are?

383
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,830
'Cause you're in your own bubble.

384
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,920
I mean this!

385
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,780
You're in the forefront of something,

386
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,610
which then means you don't understand

387
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,760
because then you're only
surrounding yourself with

388
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,130
other people that are
doing the same thing.

389
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,290
99 percent of the people
don't believe what's going on

390
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,370
in Crushing It.

391
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,770
And when I wrote the first one,

392
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,140
the thought of making money
on YouTube or social media

393
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,490
was absurd!

394
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,810
I mean, go read the first Amazon comments

395
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,220
of my first book, nine years ago.

396
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,790
So you've already got the mentality,

397
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,750
now let me give you the practicality.

398
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,543
Get four people on your team

399
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:52,280
for the cost of what you
probably allocated for one.

400
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,400
An enormous amount of
22 year olds right now

401
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,560
and more next year because
they're getting affected

402
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,460
in the teenage years,

403
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,030
every year more

404
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,550
dream job in life is to
either be an influencer,

405
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,980
or work for one.

406
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,030
That's just real!

407
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,473
- For better or for worse, yeah.

408
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,140
We're excited to read the book!

409
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,973
- Thank you, yes!

410
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:10,080
Yes enjoy!

411
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,980
- Yeah, that's my MBA right there.

412
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,813
- I love it.

413
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:14,480
I think you'll really like it.

414
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,600
I hope there's one or two
little nuggets that can

415
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,872
you're so in it that it
will come natural but

416
00:15:18,872 --> 00:15:22,502
I really actually wrote
it for people like you.

417
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:24,830
There was like four to seven
things that are in there

418
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,743
that I'm like, okay this
is the best shit I know

419
00:15:26,743 --> 00:15:29,480
that I think maybe even
for the people that know

420
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,313
they may not know.

421
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:31,146
- [Anna] Awesome.

422
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:31,979
- Thank you.

423
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:32,812
- Cool.
- [Anna] Thank you again.

424
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:33,645
- Thank you guys, take care, bye bye.

425
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:35,090
The reason this is intriguing is that

426
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,940
the streets will fuck with it,

427
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,480
and so it's got bigger upside.

428
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,830
This is why I'm gonna go to the point that

429
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,938
I want to make, which is,

430
00:15:40,938 --> 00:15:43,851
when I think about businesses like this,

431
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:45,710
the biggest thing that I'm gonna give you

432
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,073
a huge piece of recommendation.

433
00:15:47,073 --> 00:15:51,040
You don't want to be at the
mercy of these fuckin' logos.

434
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,873
Got it?

435
00:15:51,873 --> 00:15:53,271
- You don't think you
got Penn State, Michigan,

436
00:15:53,271 --> 00:15:54,104
Indiana

437
00:15:54,104 --> 00:15:54,937
- Nope!

438
00:15:54,937 --> 00:15:55,770
- You got 100

439
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:56,603
- I know exactly what you're gonna say.

440
00:15:56,603 --> 00:15:57,620
Here's the good news, no.

441
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,640
Here's why.

442
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,320
You don't have the leverage.

443
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,410
I'm gonna say it again,

444
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:06,260
It's way better if you guys
design something with a logo

445
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,800
that was yours,

446
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,550
and people started coming to you.

447
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,570
Your patent's not gonna
hold, your brand will.

448
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,500
- Let me ask you a question.

449
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,680
Luis Vuitton is not a one
single product company.

450
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,513
- It started as one.

451
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:19,710
- It did, but is that what

452
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,780
you're saying this could be?
- Period.

453
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,594
- Where we're doing more
things than just the hood?

454
00:16:22,594 --> 00:16:24,390
- That's how it always works.

455
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,223
- Okay.

456
00:16:25,223 --> 00:16:26,056
- Well just, you did say

457
00:16:26,056 --> 00:16:27,120
- [Gary V] What do you think
Under Armour started as?

458
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,010
What do you think Nike started as?

459
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,310
Every brand we're about to say

460
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,993
started as a single product company.

461
00:16:30,993 --> 00:16:32,948
- Your fifth business book

462
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:34,580
just came out.

463
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,861
- Yes.

464
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:36,887
- It will have just come out
at the time of this interview.

465
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:39,887
(light jazzy music)

466
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:55,600
- Talks for something dealing with TV.

467
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,620
- You're having a moment.

468
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,892
- Yes.

469
00:16:58,892 --> 00:16:59,725
Yes.

470
00:16:59,725 --> 00:17:01,180
And I'm trying to see
where the right place is

471
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,950
to grab it, because I love what I do.

472
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,140
I absolutely love what I do.

473
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,070
I love the classroom, I
love working with kids.

474
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,823
But I'm

475
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:11,420
- Do you understand that
you have a moment right now

476
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,880
and you can always go
back to the classroom

477
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,320
and maybe never have a
moment like this again?

478
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,799
Have you thought about that?

479
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,520
Because a lot of times I
think people think about

480
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,380
selling out or changing their lives.

481
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,650
But what I love about being a teacher

482
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,470
in many other things that people do,

483
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,670
I always remind people,
just do me one favor.

484
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,590
Know what you can come back to

485
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,900
and what you can't come back to.

486
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,020
- I definitely got a great unit, man,

487
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,590
I couldn't ask for more.

488
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,940
- Then you should go for it.

489
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,379
When shit's good, you go in the offense.

490
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:45,410
You're crippled by opportunity,

491
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,430
my answer is, if you've
got it good at home

492
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,830
and she's supporting you

493
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,780
and the little one's not going to remember

494
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,011
any of this anyway

495
00:17:51,011 --> 00:17:51,844
(laughs)

496
00:17:51,844 --> 00:17:52,677
then go.

497
00:17:52,677 --> 00:17:53,510
Take your moment.

498
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,577
- This is the stuff that
I'm telling my kids!

499
00:17:54,577 --> 00:17:55,670
(laughs)

500
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,440
Forward, like take what is there.

501
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,550
Take this opportunity.

502
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,620
This is what I'm

503
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,500
- It's easier to give
advice than to take it.

504
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,950
Which is why I think I've popped because

505
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,070
I think I only give advice
that I already took,

506
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,455
so nobody can call me
on the vulnerability.

507
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:12,870
I'm a practitioner of all my thesis.

508
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,020
Casey actually, you know what?

509
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,910
Fuckin' Casey.

510
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,350
Casey Neistat's a fuckin' beast.

511
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,258
What he said, where is he?

512
00:18:18,258 --> 00:18:20,960
'The name Gary V has
become synonymous with

513
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,430
motivating an entire generation.

514
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,160
No one understands the
power of social media

515
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,640
better than Gary, because
none of what he preaches

516
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,540
is theory.

517
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,470
It's an understanding born from his deep

518
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,997
expertise in business and life.'

519
00:18:30,997 --> 00:18:33,480
What Casey understood about
me in his quote for this book

520
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,470
is, I'm not guessing.

521
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,680
I would have regretted if
I didn't take my moment

522
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,030
back in 2006 when I'm like,

523
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,680
wait a minute, am I a wine merchant

524
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,214
or am I a anthropology-like digital

525
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:48,331
what am I?

526
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:49,164
- Right.

527
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:49,997
- I could

528
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:50,830
I never knew the word

529
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,720
I wasn't a good student so I
didn't know all these words.

530
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,950
They came to me later.

531
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,570
But I failed forward, I tasted,

532
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,520
and most of all, I just
did not worry about

533
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,540
what anybody else thought.

534
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,499
Go do your thing.

535
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:01,711
- I'm ready to, man.

536
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:03,356
- Just go do it.
- I'm really really serious.

537
00:19:03,356 --> 00:19:04,700
- Honestly just go very hard.

538
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,920
- Yeah.
- Say yes to everything.

539
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,753
- Word.

540
00:19:06,753 --> 00:19:07,960
- Until you can't fuckin' breathe.

541
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,110
- I'm ready for 'em and you know,

542
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,080
it's funny, this was the year I said,

543
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,610
at school I was like,
this was gonna be my year

544
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,750
to say no.

545
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,849
And watch all the things
that I'm accepting,

546
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:18,706
but I realized, like you're saying,

547
00:19:18,706 --> 00:19:21,670
the more important focus is that yes.

548
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,503
And where I'm putting those yes's.

549
00:19:22,503 --> 00:19:24,190
- Dude, you know what's up?

550
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,010
When you say yes,

551
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,540
and you can't breathe
anymore because you're

552
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,240
saying yes to everything,

553
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,250
the yes's are giving you more oxygen!

554
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,520
- Yeah

555
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,353
It's the truth.

556
00:19:32,353 --> 00:19:33,202
- It's the truth.

557
00:19:33,202 --> 00:19:34,430
- Thank you for this, man.

558
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,897
- Talk to you soon.
- Can't say it enough,

559
00:19:35,897 --> 00:19:36,832
thank you so much.
- Stay well.

560
00:19:36,832 --> 00:19:38,704
- Peace, y'all.

561
00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:42,121
(reflective piano music)

562
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,440
- The day's been fuckin' crazy.

563
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,520
Straight fuckin' crazy.

564
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,353
Right?

565
00:20:13,353 --> 00:20:14,186
- [Female] Yeah.

566
00:20:14,186 --> 00:20:15,170
- Even by our standards.

567
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,520
- Okay, you ready?

568
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,020
Do you think that there's destiny in life?

569
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,141
- I think DNA is a big fuckin' deal.

570
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,620
And I think has a whole lot to do with

571
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,200
how things play out.

572
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,560
And I think there's certain people who

573
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,182
have DNA traits that
create scenarios that are

574
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:40,328
easy to see from far away.

575
00:20:40,328 --> 00:20:41,610
I'm outta here.

576
00:20:41,610 --> 00:00:00,000
Iris, see ya.
