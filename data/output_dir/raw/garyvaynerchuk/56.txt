1
00:00:00,831 --> 00:00:02,960
- Gary if you could just wave
your hand above the glasses

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,447
and tell me what you feel.

3
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:05,280
- Nothing.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,767
- That's the point.
- Okay.

5
00:00:06,767 --> 00:00:08,121
- You see the middle of the glasses?

6
00:00:08,121 --> 00:00:08,954
- I do.

7
00:00:08,954 --> 00:00:11,206
- Watch, watch with me, you ready?

8
00:00:11,206 --> 00:00:14,956
So looking in this area,
come from this side.

9
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:19,218
Yeah just look here, watch.

10
00:00:19,218 --> 00:00:21,801
(upbeat music)

11
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:27,688
- How are you, I'm Gary.

12
00:00:27,688 --> 00:00:29,597
- Thank you for having
us there, it's great.

13
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:30,605
- No worries.

14
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:33,174
- I actually, on the way
here I was on the elevator

15
00:00:33,174 --> 00:00:34,687
and I wanted to ask you a question,

16
00:00:34,687 --> 00:00:35,960
I'm gonna write something here.

17
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,968
- [Man] You got it.

18
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:39,478
- Because we're shooting this so...

19
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:42,505
- By the way thank God I
can't do this because I'd be,

20
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:44,325
I'd be the worst.

21
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:46,022
- Go straight to Gary,
Gary look at the camera

22
00:00:46,022 --> 00:00:47,926
and tell us a two digit number,

23
00:00:47,926 --> 00:00:50,006
whatever you want, just say something.

24
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:51,045
- One five.

25
00:00:51,045 --> 00:00:52,075
- So it's 15.

26
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:53,083
- Yes.

27
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:54,874
- I wrote here Gary will say 15.

28
00:00:54,874 --> 00:00:55,885
(laughter)

29
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:56,894
- I don't know what else to tell you.

30
00:00:56,894 --> 00:00:57,904
- Do you see?

31
00:00:57,904 --> 00:00:58,913
- I see it.

32
00:00:58,913 --> 00:01:01,206
- Yes so why did you say
15, this is the question.

33
00:01:01,206 --> 00:01:02,389
- Because you put it in my head.

34
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:04,667
- It's close to this,
it's close to this, yes.

35
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:06,662
Hi you guys, nice to meet you,

36
00:01:06,662 --> 00:01:09,750
very awkward moment here but it's fun.

37
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,891
- It's fucking the best I--

38
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:12,832
believe in this shit
completely by the way.

39
00:01:12,832 --> 00:01:13,845
- It's not about believing,

40
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:15,249
first of all it's about experiencing.

41
00:01:15,249 --> 00:01:16,082
- Yes.

42
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:19,454
- I always say to people
it's not supernatural powers,

43
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,164
it's based on psychology or--

44
00:01:22,164 --> 00:01:24,036
I'll ask you like a quick question

45
00:01:24,036 --> 00:01:26,023
and try to go really fast.

46
00:01:26,023 --> 00:01:28,097
Tell me the name of your first kiss.

47
00:01:28,097 --> 00:01:29,110
- Kim.

48
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,964
- Kim okay so by saying this to you

49
00:01:30,964 --> 00:01:33,365
this causes the entire
room to start thinking of,

50
00:01:33,365 --> 00:01:34,601
see you start to think of the name,

51
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:35,434
and you think of the name.

52
00:01:35,434 --> 00:01:36,267
- Yeah okay.

53
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:37,100
- And you think of the name
and you think of the name.

54
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,214
- Yep.

55
00:01:38,214 --> 00:01:39,277
- Lindsay.

56
00:01:39,277 --> 00:01:40,276
- [Lindsay] Mhmmm?

57
00:01:40,276 --> 00:01:41,286
- I'm just looking at you right now,

58
00:01:41,286 --> 00:01:44,295
let me tell you the process
just for clarification

59
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:45,625
you did not tell me the name.

60
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:46,645
- [Lindsay] True.

61
00:01:46,645 --> 00:01:48,135
- Look at me, look at me, look at me.

62
00:01:48,135 --> 00:01:50,128
Do you know the name of her first kiss?

63
00:01:50,128 --> 00:01:50,961
- [Gary] No.

64
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:51,794
(Lindsay laughing)

65
00:01:51,794 --> 00:01:52,627
- Okay so just--

66
00:01:52,627 --> 00:01:53,460
- [Lindsay] That'd be weird if you did.

67
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,405
- Just think of it,

68
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,748
just think of a letter
in the middle of the name

69
00:01:57,748 --> 00:01:58,763
but don't say it.

70
00:01:58,763 --> 00:01:59,800
- [Lindsay] K.

71
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,195
- Okay you just had D.

72
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:03,395
(Lindsay laughing)

73
00:02:03,395 --> 00:02:05,249
Can you, can you tape her for a second?

74
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:06,544
- Did you catch that?

75
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:08,127
(laughter)

76
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,615
- [Mentalist] You felt something

77
00:02:09,616 --> 00:02:12,254
and I'm gonna write
something for you here.

78
00:02:12,254 --> 00:02:13,945
- It's so impressive, right?

79
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:16,665
- [Mentalist] Now I swear
we don't know each other--

80
00:02:16,665 --> 00:02:18,814
- I'm aware, we're not on stage here.

81
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:20,772
- [Mentalist] It just seems
to be very about this moment

82
00:02:20,772 --> 00:02:22,009
that we don't know each other.

83
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,276
- By the way this is the best moment

84
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,291
that ever happened in my life.

85
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,139
- [Mentalist] Oh I love it.

86
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:27,683
- No no I'm being dead serious

87
00:02:27,683 --> 00:02:29,380
this is the best moment of my life.

88
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,275
Like you have to understand
I love this so much

89
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:34,963
like you have to understand there's no,

90
00:02:34,963 --> 00:02:39,059
there is no logical science
explanation for that

91
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:41,219
it's that you have to understand

92
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:44,243
I don't have this unfortunately

93
00:02:44,243 --> 00:02:48,410
but I have something in
the way that I live my life

94
00:02:50,468 --> 00:02:52,468
that is a cousin to this

95
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,366
that makes me understand its possibility.

96
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:57,388
- [Mentalist] Exactly.

97
00:02:57,388 --> 00:03:02,303
- Like everything I say is
gonna happen to me happens.

98
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:03,311
- [Mentalist] I will say that

99
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:05,831
people think the universe
listens basically.

100
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:07,416
- I genuinely believe that man.

101
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,538
- [Mentalist] Hold this,
don't show her yet,

102
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:10,761
don't show her, I wrote
something over there.

103
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:14,083
What was your age when
you had your first kiss?

104
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,064
- [Lindsay] Uh, 13?

105
00:03:16,064 --> 00:03:18,258
- [Mentalist] 13 so that's like...

106
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:20,030
- I'm impressed, very nice girl.

107
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,434
- [Lindsay] Thank you.

108
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,528
- [Mentalist] Look at
the camera dramatically.

109
00:03:22,528 --> 00:03:23,560
- Oh man.

110
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,331
- [Mentalist] Yes and tell us the name.

111
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,344
- Aren't you gonna tell me the name?

112
00:03:27,344 --> 00:03:28,607
- [Man] No, no, no, you tell the camera.

113
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:30,965
- [Mentalist] Just say the name.

114
00:03:30,965 --> 00:03:31,994
- His name's Eddie.

115
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:34,026
- [Mentalist] Eddie? Can
you show her what I uh...

116
00:03:34,026 --> 00:03:37,068
- It's so good, it's so good!

117
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:38,635
- It was a real kiss.

118
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,555
(laughs)

119
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:42,114
- Wait go back to me, go back to me.

120
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:45,642
So Eddie if you're
watching this right now--

121
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,648
It's fun, it's fun.

122
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:48,036
- I genuinely mean this.

123
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:49,703
I know that I don't,

124
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:54,423
again, I don't have this
but the reason I absolutely,

125
00:03:54,423 --> 00:03:59,044
don't understand it, but
fundamentally understand

126
00:03:59,044 --> 00:04:01,156
why we are blown away by this is

127
00:04:01,156 --> 00:04:04,307
you just have a extreme different version

128
00:04:04,307 --> 00:04:07,305
of something that I know
I'm living my life as

129
00:04:07,305 --> 00:04:09,893
and so it makes sense,
I don't understand it

130
00:04:09,893 --> 00:04:12,810
but but when I sell or when I talk,

131
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,603
when I interact with a human being,

132
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:18,677
I just know everything
that they're thinking.

133
00:04:18,678 --> 00:04:20,582
Like I just know
everything that's going on.

134
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:22,024
- [Mentalist] So it's basically
the same process that I have

135
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:24,305
because I didn't know
how do I do what I do.

136
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,328
- Yes I understand.

137
00:04:25,328 --> 00:04:28,736
By the way I get it, I
genuinely know what's going on.

138
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:29,888
- You thought of B by the way,

139
00:04:29,888 --> 00:04:31,440
the letter B when she was thinking of,

140
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,708
yeah you had a B in your mind.

141
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,500
- No but by the way, by the way,

142
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,630
it's so interesting and the reason,

143
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,300
and the reason is seven years ago

144
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,837
I decided I would never get sick again.

145
00:04:43,837 --> 00:04:45,278
I'm not gonna get sick ever again.

146
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:47,171
- [Mentalist] Unbelievable.
- I know it for fact.

147
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:48,986
- [Mentalist] Amazing.
- I don't wash my hands,

148
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:53,019
I travel 180 days a year,
I bite my fingernails.

149
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:56,602
I'm not, I'm not, I'm
not able to get sick.

150
00:04:59,745 --> 00:05:01,152
I don't know what to tell you.

151
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:02,153
I just think that

152
00:05:02,153 --> 00:05:05,441
we grossly underestimate
the brain in normal society.

153
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:06,422
- [Mentalist] That's the story of my life.

154
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:08,820
- Listen I get it so I understand.

155
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,098
I really genuinely do.

156
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:11,093
- [Mentalist] So it is great to meet you.

157
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:12,123
- It's great to meet you.

158
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:13,714
- I wish you could come
yesterday to the show.

159
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:14,914
- Can I, you'll like this.

160
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:18,066
When I was thinking my
number, five came to me

161
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:19,957
'cause it always does
it's my favorite number

162
00:05:19,957 --> 00:05:22,859
but I was about to say something
and instead I said to 15.

163
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:24,256
- Boom, that was me influencing you.

164
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:25,089
- I know that.

165
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:26,219
I genuinely believe you.

166
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:28,459
I actually could feel it happen.

167
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:29,709
- Mhmmm, mhmmm.

168
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:32,021
- [Lindsay] I believe you.

169
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:33,948
- I know you guys know me
a little bit like I get it

170
00:05:33,948 --> 00:05:36,684
I literally get it I was
trying to say something else

171
00:05:36,684 --> 00:05:38,732
and it's amazing

172
00:05:38,732 --> 00:05:40,525
I actually just am going
backwards right now

173
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:42,171
I was trying to say something else

174
00:05:42,171 --> 00:05:44,139
and I was forced to say 15,

175
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:45,937
I'm telling you guys that's the truth.

176
00:05:45,937 --> 00:05:47,006
- So I have to tell you something,

177
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:48,628
something that you'll love.

178
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:49,461
So I started--

179
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:52,453
- Can I harness this, like
I feel like, I feel like--

180
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:53,450
- Yeah first we came here

181
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,533
I saw people working outside

182
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:56,486
listen we need to arrange
a show here for everyone.

183
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:57,434
- Done.

184
00:05:57,434 --> 00:05:58,586
- Blow their minds away.
- Done.

185
00:05:58,586 --> 00:05:59,886
When are you back in New York?

186
00:05:59,886 --> 00:06:00,845
- I don't know yet but...

187
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:03,913
- Okay. Tyler make it happen,
we'll do a company wide event.

188
00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:04,936
- Yes cool,

189
00:06:04,936 --> 00:06:07,825
now second thing is because
you work with brands.

190
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,830
- [Gary] Yes.

191
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,250
- What I started to do, it
started as pure entertainment,

192
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,874
fun, getting people on
stage, get them blown away,

193
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,920
it became, it's still a one man.

194
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,915
- Yeah.

195
00:06:18,915 --> 00:06:21,148
- My show is in this bag.

196
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:23,802
I have like office supplies
and stuff and I guess things

197
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:25,808
and it's a crazy paradoxes that happens

198
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:28,808
but then I start to invent something

199
00:06:31,032 --> 00:06:33,800
so my invention's like infotainment.

200
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,936
Which means it's like a live commercial.

201
00:06:36,936 --> 00:06:37,936
- I understand.

202
00:06:37,936 --> 00:06:40,184
- On stage, I'll give
you a perfect example,

203
00:06:40,184 --> 00:06:44,504
I did an event for Swatch
Group for their watch

204
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,992
and I brought five people on stage

205
00:06:45,992 --> 00:06:47,919
and we stopped their watches completely.

206
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,097
Stopped them from working.

207
00:06:49,097 --> 00:06:50,859
And everybody was oh my God oh my God

208
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:53,837
but there was one girl
that her watch kept moving

209
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:56,682
and I was going like what do
you have, I was acting like--

210
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:57,515
- [Gary] Yeah.

211
00:06:57,515 --> 00:06:58,348
- Something is wrong here.

212
00:06:58,348 --> 00:06:59,181
- [Gary] Yeah of course.

213
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:02,347
- And like oh it's this
watch, no I can't stop it

214
00:07:02,347 --> 00:07:04,545
and everybody was making fun

215
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:08,246
because basically we
remember the extraordinary,

216
00:07:08,246 --> 00:07:11,021
that's what commercials are based on.

217
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:12,205
You will not remember

218
00:07:12,205 --> 00:07:15,949
what you wore three weeks ago on Monday.

219
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:16,959
You don't remember,

220
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,845
but you remember exactly what
happened at 9/11 2001 exactly.

221
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:22,174
- [Gary] 100%, 100%.

222
00:07:22,174 --> 00:07:24,577
- Because it was an experience for you.

223
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:28,097
So I create those oh moments and I

224
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:31,329
boom and I plug the
message of the company.

225
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:33,511
So in Germany I drove a car blindfolded

226
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:37,680
to say you can count on the
new BMW with your eyes closed.

227
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,660
So I create those crazy experiments,

228
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,557
it's fun to invent ideas for technology

229
00:07:43,557 --> 00:07:45,669
if there's a company that's--

230
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:46,685
- I understand.

231
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:47,765
- Yeah it's a lot of fun.

232
00:07:47,765 --> 00:07:49,765
So it involves a lot of creativity.

233
00:07:49,765 --> 00:07:51,189
- So what's the punchline right now?

234
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:53,719
Like help me reverse engineer.

235
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:55,593
- [Mentalist] Okay.

236
00:07:55,593 --> 00:08:00,025
- What are you excited about
in the short and long term?

237
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:03,927
- [Mentalist] Short term I'm
excited to perform, to perform.

238
00:08:03,927 --> 00:08:05,659
- You love it. You live for it.

239
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:06,727
It's your oxygen.

240
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:07,560
- [Mentalist] It is.

241
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,814
- Okay keep going, I understand that.

242
00:08:08,814 --> 00:08:09,824
- I love to perform,

243
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:12,566
I love the reaction, I
love to bring people.

244
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:13,689
- [Gary] What's better than that?

245
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:15,561
- Supposed to be a 15 minute show

246
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:16,997
ends up being 90 minutes
everybody's like--

247
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,205
- [Gary] I totally get it.

248
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:19,372
- It was fun.

249
00:08:19,372 --> 00:08:20,705
Long term it's--

250
00:08:22,264 --> 00:08:25,317
- [Gary] How much do you
care about your legacy?

251
00:08:25,317 --> 00:08:26,330
- Oh that's a lot,

252
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,386
that's something new that
I started to think of.

253
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:30,370
That's very, very important for me.

254
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,537
- [Gary] Yeah, it should be.

255
00:08:31,537 --> 00:08:34,413
- Yeah I just, did I
tell you about my dream?

256
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,035
I had-- I was talking to--

257
00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:38,880
I have a lot of dreams
and thoughts about this

258
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:42,797
and I thought okay I know
my dad, my grandfather,

259
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:45,043
I remember his father but that's it.

260
00:08:45,043 --> 00:08:48,093
So you don't remember
who was his dad, right?

261
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:51,262
And that's like 100 years,
that's it, that's nothing.

262
00:08:51,262 --> 00:08:52,484
- That's what this is, my friend.

263
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:54,292
Right now, right now my

264
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:57,412
great, great, great,
great, great granddaughter

265
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,191
is watching this right now.

266
00:09:00,191 --> 00:09:03,038
- [Mentalist] Or is if
we're talking about...

267
00:09:03,038 --> 00:09:04,359
- So you know what I mean though?

268
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:05,192
- Of course.

269
00:09:05,192 --> 00:09:06,025
- It's fucking cool.

270
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:06,858
- Of course.

271
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:10,670
But I'm, listen I wrote a
book about positive thinking

272
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,030
because I really believe in this,

273
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,045
the whole show is based on think positive

274
00:09:14,045 --> 00:09:16,158
because you can never know
who's reading your mind

275
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:18,305
so control your thoughts,
that's what I do.

276
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:19,909
- [Gary] That's cool, that's clever.

277
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:21,512
- And I really love this concept

278
00:09:21,512 --> 00:09:25,012
and I'm working with companies
and with individuals.

279
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:27,351
In the long term we'd be
keep doing exactly what I do

280
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:28,884
but going into the--

281
00:09:28,884 --> 00:09:30,884
- From your perspective,

282
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,934
I mean I have a feeling of what you know

283
00:09:34,934 --> 00:09:37,365
and I don't assume you know
everything about how I roll.

284
00:09:37,365 --> 00:09:40,115
Do you feel as though what I feel

285
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,870
which is because I'm
good at communications

286
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,479
that I myself have more
awareness in the marketplace

287
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:53,174
than like I should be the one that says it

288
00:09:53,174 --> 00:09:57,460
that I deserve because I'm
good at that and that that,

289
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,356
I know what you're doing,

290
00:09:58,356 --> 00:09:59,589
you're just putting people together.

291
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:02,034
- You figure out a way to
say okay here are people,

292
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,362
here are products and services.

293
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:04,371
- Yes.

294
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,230
- [Man] And how do you
get the message across

295
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,341
where everybody today you look

296
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,812
everyone's looking at this device,

297
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:11,268
no one's looking at billboards,

298
00:10:11,268 --> 00:10:13,115
no one's sitting there
looking at magazine ads

299
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:14,204
and things like that,

300
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:16,396
television commercials,
people fast forward.

301
00:10:16,396 --> 00:10:19,148
So coming up with ways to
take products and services

302
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:21,724
and your big thing which
I've read your books,

303
00:10:21,724 --> 00:10:24,076
come up with a good product and service.

304
00:10:24,076 --> 00:10:26,102
- Yes and you just think
this is an amazing product.

305
00:10:26,102 --> 00:10:27,836
- And he is who he is

306
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,300
and I know you're working
with all these companies

307
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,200
doing what you do,

308
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,236
he's working with all these
companies that do what you do

309
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:36,430
and put two people in a room and say okay.

310
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,110
- I just think I'm a very good weapon,

311
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,070
to say weapon in front of
companies or individuals.

312
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,391
- [Gary] I get it.

313
00:10:43,391 --> 00:10:46,999
- So today do maybe some fun
interesting things that--

314
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:48,707
- [Gary] How do you categorize yourself?

315
00:10:48,707 --> 00:10:52,120
- I am a mentalist, a master mentalist.

316
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,015
- [Gary] Master mentalist.

317
00:10:53,015 --> 00:10:54,278
- Yes, yes.

318
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,611
- [Gary] And who's the
number one master mentalist

319
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:57,096
in the world?

320
00:10:57,096 --> 00:10:59,504
And does the world believe that?

321
00:10:59,504 --> 00:11:00,886
- Depends who you ask.
- [Gary] Cool.

322
00:11:00,886 --> 00:11:02,180
- The only problem is...

323
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,571
- If I ask 7.8 billion people,
who would be number one?

324
00:11:05,571 --> 00:11:07,060
- They won't know how to tell you.

325
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,131
They will say David Copperfield.

326
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:10,971
- I think you're right,
I think you're right.

327
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,949
Can I ask you a real selfish question?

328
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:13,782
- [Mentalist] Always.

329
00:11:13,782 --> 00:11:15,779
- Do you want them to say you?

330
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,112
I mean it.

331
00:11:17,112 --> 00:11:17,945
And I need you to--

332
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,653
- [Mentalist] The only thing is

333
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:23,820
I love when this 1% of the
population, South Arabian prince.

334
00:11:25,748 --> 00:11:26,581
- Yeah.

335
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:27,750
- King of Thailand just passed away.

336
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,018
- Yeah I saw, 88 years old, go ahead.

337
00:11:30,018 --> 00:11:32,402
- I did a performance for
him and all those people

338
00:11:32,402 --> 00:11:37,107
so it's like 0.1% of this
population knows about me.

339
00:11:37,107 --> 00:11:39,139
Those specific people.

340
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:40,145
- The people that can afford

341
00:11:40,145 --> 00:11:41,245
to have you do private
things at their home.

342
00:11:41,245 --> 00:11:43,119
- Yes.
- [Gary] Go ahead.

343
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,519
- Sometimes I want to go to mass public,

344
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,519
sometimes I don't want too much because...

345
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,680
- [Gary] You like your life?

346
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,960
- That's why I'm expensive,
that's why I'm like...

347
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,961
- [Gary] I understand.

348
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,168
- That's why I don't have
managers and people it's like--

349
00:11:55,168 --> 00:11:56,173
- [Gary] I understand.

350
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,172
- Very boutique.

351
00:11:57,172 --> 00:11:58,005
- [Gary] You'd much rather do

352
00:11:58,005 --> 00:11:59,232
seven events at a million dollars each

353
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:01,553
than 59 events to do
seven million dollars.

354
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:02,638
- I would do two.

355
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,884
- I understand.

356
00:12:03,884 --> 00:12:04,889
Would you?

357
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:05,882
Would you?

358
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:07,381
Because if you really do love to perform

359
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:08,376
you wouldn't do two.

360
00:12:08,376 --> 00:12:10,003
Your business head would do two.

361
00:12:10,003 --> 00:12:11,489
- [Mentalist] No no,
business wise I would do two.

362
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:13,399
- I understand, I would, I would--

363
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,519
- I would do 30 charity events supporting,

364
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:17,768
using my connections.

365
00:12:17,768 --> 00:12:18,891
- [Gary] I understand.

366
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:20,021
- Using stuff like that.

367
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:22,444
But to make a living
I would do the minimum

368
00:12:22,444 --> 00:12:24,117
and then focus...

369
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:25,124
- On other things.

370
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,993
Other things.
- On cool cool things, yes.

371
00:12:27,993 --> 00:12:29,992
- But you're also, he's
got two children and all,

372
00:12:29,992 --> 00:12:34,509
Tel Aviv based, he's on a
plane probably 180 days a year.

373
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:36,828
- [Mentalist] 176, he's more.

374
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:38,619
- 177 for me.

375
00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:40,191
I wrote it down right here.

376
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:42,153
(laughter)

377
00:12:42,153 --> 00:12:43,153
- Oh my god!

378
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:47,982
- So those are things where just

379
00:12:47,982 --> 00:12:49,865
I'd like to be able to see for him

380
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:51,284
I always thought of having him

381
00:12:51,284 --> 00:12:53,412
let's say in New York City Broadway.

382
00:12:53,412 --> 00:12:55,335
- I would do this, you
know what's so funny?

383
00:12:55,335 --> 00:12:58,176
Like by the way the most
interesting part of this was

384
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:01,425
I was literally able to feel
me being forced to say it.

385
00:13:01,425 --> 00:13:02,258
- [Mentalist] Yeah, yeah.

386
00:13:02,258 --> 00:13:04,008
- Do a lot of people get that?

387
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:05,009
- [Mentalist] Not a lot.

388
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:06,055
- That's why I feel like I got something

389
00:13:06,055 --> 00:13:07,516
'cause I actually, I mean it.

390
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:08,511
- [Mentalist] It's
sensitive, very sensitive.

391
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:09,725
- I'm the most sensitive.

392
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:11,473
- [Lindsay] We know. (laughs)

393
00:13:11,473 --> 00:13:12,813
- No really, it's real.

394
00:13:12,813 --> 00:13:13,646
- You know what?

395
00:13:13,646 --> 00:13:14,479
- I'm stealing your phone here Gary.

396
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:15,312
- Xander, Xander--

397
00:13:15,312 --> 00:13:16,145
Okay no problem.

398
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:16,978
Xander is showing it.
- You have a password?

399
00:13:16,978 --> 00:13:17,811
- [Lindsay] Really?
- Yes. Yes.

400
00:13:17,811 --> 00:13:18,644
- Okay I know it's password, it's fine.

401
00:13:18,644 --> 00:13:20,089
- Yes.

402
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:21,212
(laughter)

403
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:23,001
- [Lindsay] You think he's
more sensitive than you?

404
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:24,763
- [Gary] I don't know
and actually you know

405
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:27,124
that'd be one place where
I wouldn't be competitive,

406
00:13:27,124 --> 00:13:30,374
that would make me happy
'cause I think it's special.

407
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:31,955
- Okay so you need to
change your password.

408
00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:33,955
- [Gary] No problem.

409
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:36,646
- It's a fun game, fun game.

410
00:13:36,646 --> 00:13:39,192
You press a two digit number.

411
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:40,025
- [Gary] Two digit?

412
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:42,761
- Two digit, put it in
one, just do that tip tip.

413
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:44,044
And you press plus.

414
00:13:44,044 --> 00:13:45,046
- Kay.

415
00:13:45,046 --> 00:13:47,588
- [Mentalist] And what you
do, don't think about it.

416
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:48,421
- Okay, yep.

417
00:13:48,421 --> 00:13:50,200
- Just use your intuition it's very fun.

418
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,091
If this works I will be in shock.

419
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:53,989
You keep going, is it 91?

420
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:54,982
- Yes.

421
00:13:54,982 --> 00:13:56,381
- You already did plus plus, right?

422
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:57,390
- I hit plus, yes.

423
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,140
- Okay so one more number,
like two digits again.

424
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,122
- Two digits again?

425
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:01,127
- And plus again

426
00:14:01,127 --> 00:14:03,081
and you keep doing it
like different numbers.

427
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:04,077
- Keep going?

428
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:07,460
- Yes, two digits, boom
plus, two digits, plus,

429
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,921
and just can you go faster?

430
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:09,917
- Yes.

431
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:13,123
- Just tap, tap, tap,
plus, da da da da very good

432
00:14:13,123 --> 00:14:15,297
and now go to three digits.

433
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:17,797
Da da plus da da da plus stop.

434
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:20,969
Divide.

435
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:22,260
- Divide?

436
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,010
- Two digit number. Equal. Score?

437
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:30,832
- Five two one oh nine.

438
00:14:30,832 --> 00:14:31,665
- Crazy.

439
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:36,777
That's your number yeah
that's your number.

440
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:37,781
- That's my number?

441
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:38,783
- Yep.

442
00:14:38,783 --> 00:14:40,450
That's 52901, 52109?

443
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:42,912
(laughter)

444
00:14:42,912 --> 00:14:44,454
- So great!

445
00:14:44,454 --> 00:14:46,235
- No but you know what's
special about 52901,

446
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:48,363
I say it's your number
yes it's your number Gary,

447
00:14:48,363 --> 00:14:50,192
it's G, A, and R, and Y.

448
00:14:50,192 --> 00:14:52,605
(laughter)

449
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:53,938
- Her face is...

450
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:59,697
I fucking love it, I
believe in it the most

451
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:01,703
and when I tell you,

452
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:06,135
when I tell you that my
interest in magic when I was--

453
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:07,134
- Don't call it magic.

454
00:15:07,134 --> 00:15:10,967
- Respect, but like my
interest level in this,

455
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,872
zero interest in believing. Zero.

456
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:19,924
It's all practical,

457
00:15:19,924 --> 00:15:23,963
I just know it's real, I know
it's real, I know it's real.

458
00:15:23,963 --> 00:15:24,968
- [Man] It's amazing stuff though.

459
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:26,686
- No it's the craziest shit of all time

460
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:30,768
are you fucking kidding
me, like the craziest shit

461
00:15:30,768 --> 00:15:33,797
but I understand so listen I,

462
00:15:33,797 --> 00:15:35,647
I could do this the rest of my life.

463
00:15:35,647 --> 00:15:39,814
Here's what I would say
because I think my intuition is

464
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,811
you also understand the way I understand.

465
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:45,774
I think I can really help

466
00:15:45,774 --> 00:15:48,032
I just need to be able to reverse engineer

467
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:50,622
and I wanna help, it's
where I'm most comfortable.

468
00:15:50,622 --> 00:15:51,707
- That's why we're here.

469
00:15:51,707 --> 00:15:52,835
I have to tell you something

470
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:54,746
and to be completely completely honest,

471
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,709
we did some very cool projects,
very very cool things,

472
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:00,157
some of them are big
some of them are small,

473
00:16:00,157 --> 00:16:02,774
I'll tell you a little bit one project

474
00:16:02,774 --> 00:16:05,975
I got a phone call three months
ago from Barbara Streisand

475
00:16:05,975 --> 00:16:07,433
and she said listen we're doing a tour,

476
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,025
do you wanna do a show with me?

477
00:16:09,025 --> 00:16:10,568
So obviously say yes,

478
00:16:10,568 --> 00:16:12,663
now my show is not
designed for 20,000 people.

479
00:16:12,663 --> 00:16:13,671
- [Gary] Sure.

480
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:15,678
- So I had to invent ideas
and it worked perfectly.

481
00:16:15,678 --> 00:16:17,425
- [Gary] Of course.

482
00:16:17,425 --> 00:16:19,747
- It was so much fun and--

483
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:21,870
- Well it's important to let you--

484
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,243
Barbara was singing and you
had Barbara part of the show.

485
00:16:25,243 --> 00:16:26,362
- Yes, yes.

486
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:27,423
- She didn't leave the
stage and do a thing.

487
00:16:27,423 --> 00:16:29,004
- We do all this stuff and it's fun

488
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:31,963
but most of it we're doing
scattered and just creating

489
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:33,506
oh let's do this let's do this or this

490
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:37,089
and I think you could
help us be more like,

491
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:42,727
with ideas and be more
organized or create something.

492
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:44,010
- [Gary] I think so too.

493
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,289
- Because what do you
do in the social media?

494
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:46,492
You don't really do anything
other than Facebook?

495
00:16:46,492 --> 00:16:47,325
- Yeah.

496
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:48,158
- You know what?

497
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:48,991
It's better than that.

498
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:50,245
It's a top line strategy

499
00:16:50,245 --> 00:16:52,085
reverse engineering the
reality of what you want.

500
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:53,217
- I'm a no tech person, you know?

501
00:16:53,217 --> 00:16:55,001
- That's okay, me too.

502
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:57,505
- Because even in the shows
by the way a mentalist,

503
00:16:57,505 --> 00:17:00,715
I cannot go on a show and
start doing screens and stuff

504
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:02,222
because people will think technology.

505
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:05,186
I have to go with a chalkboard
and write stuff down

506
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:07,641
and show people that it's
authentic, that it's real.

507
00:17:07,642 --> 00:17:09,596
Do you have glasses?

508
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:12,723
This is the grand finale, sunglasses.

509
00:17:12,723 --> 00:17:13,720
- [Gary] No.

510
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,345
- [Man] Up there.

511
00:17:15,345 --> 00:17:16,594
- [Lindsay] Oh on your shelf.

512
00:17:16,594 --> 00:17:18,553
- Yeah but I get it,
see I'm not using mine

513
00:17:18,553 --> 00:17:19,935
and I need you to come over here

514
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:23,101
and do a over the shoulder
shot and you come here

515
00:17:23,102 --> 00:17:26,549
and I want you to, we'll put over here,

516
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:31,468
come come come, and your first
kiss kind of a weird name.

517
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,636
- [Man] Yeah it's a super weird name.

518
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:33,843
- Like where is she from?

519
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:34,722
- She...

520
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:36,091
- She lives in America.

521
00:17:36,091 --> 00:17:38,131
- Last name would not be American, no.

522
00:17:38,131 --> 00:17:39,089
It was a last name.

523
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:42,152
- Oh a last name, oh
really, whoa like Ebel?

524
00:17:42,152 --> 00:17:43,069
Ibel, Ebel?

525
00:17:43,989 --> 00:17:45,398
- Is that where it's from you're asking?

526
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,941
- No the name is close, am
I close? What's the name?

527
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,245
- Yeah, a little bit. Tabey.

528
00:17:48,245 --> 00:17:50,401
- Tabey, oh okay, I
was close, I was close.

529
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:51,234
- [Man] You had the B.

530
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:52,117
- Exactly.

531
00:17:52,117 --> 00:17:53,994
Gary, just wave your
hand above the glasses

532
00:17:53,994 --> 00:17:55,410
and tell me what you feel.

533
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,243
- Nothing.

534
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:57,670
- That's the point.
- Okay.

535
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,833
- You see the middle of the glasses?

536
00:17:58,833 --> 00:17:59,836
- I do.

537
00:17:59,836 --> 00:18:01,289
- Watch, watch with me, you ready?

538
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,623
You watching, you watching?

539
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,206
So looking, and camera
come from this side.

540
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:08,716
Just look here.

541
00:18:12,096 --> 00:18:13,628
- Yeah I just, you know.

542
00:18:13,628 --> 00:18:14,879
(laughter)

543
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:16,629
It's the best, but...

544
00:18:17,967 --> 00:18:18,967
- I love it.

545
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:22,974
- [Lindsay] How much
strength does that take?

546
00:18:22,974 --> 00:18:24,435
- Oh it's a lot it's
like working in a gym.

547
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:25,562
- No way.
- Yes.

548
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,596
- It was a piece of cake for him.

549
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:29,388
- No no no no for me after
like I wanna do a few acts

550
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:31,135
and I'm starting to sweat and--

551
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:35,971
- So listen so I think so
Tyler we need to obviously run.

552
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:37,604
Get us together.

553
00:18:37,604 --> 00:18:40,097
Let me like, I wanna actually,

554
00:18:40,097 --> 00:18:41,649
this is not something I wanna rush.

555
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:45,649
Look, I get, I don't think
like this all makes--

556
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,528
I'm gonna say something,

557
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:50,818
this makes more sense to me

558
00:18:50,818 --> 00:18:53,181
than anybody you've ever met in your life.

559
00:18:53,181 --> 00:18:55,535
Now what I need is a little bit more time

560
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:58,755
to get you into a place for what I do well

561
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:03,390
in a comfortable place
so I can really help you.

562
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,919
- We love it.
- Great.

563
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,429
- [Man] Well I want it to be mutually

564
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:08,227
like whatever it is you do I mean--

565
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:09,344
- He just did this,

566
00:19:09,344 --> 00:19:12,676
he just did this thing I
mean this was enough, 52109.

567
00:19:12,676 --> 00:19:16,607
52109 is like my number, no 100%.

568
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:20,024
- [Mentalist] There you go, there you go.

569
00:19:22,131 --> 00:19:24,408
- And I think, and this
is kind of back to like

570
00:19:24,408 --> 00:19:25,991
versions of the same game,

571
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:28,537
I'm only most comfortable
in providing val--

572
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:31,132
like it's all gonna be, like
I don't know any other move

573
00:19:31,132 --> 00:19:33,091
and the same way he can
flip fucking glasses

574
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:35,456
like I'm not interested in what--

575
00:19:35,456 --> 00:19:37,289
I don't have that gear.

576
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:40,379
I don't know what's in it
for me, I know I wanna do it.

577
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,379
- [Man] Okay.

578
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:42,373
- Like do you understand?

579
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:44,006
- [Man] I get it, alright.

580
00:19:44,006 --> 00:19:46,182
- Really cool, my friend,
great to meet you.

581
00:19:46,182 --> 00:19:47,015
- I enjoyed that very much.

582
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:48,098
- Have to give you a hug, I'm a hugger.

583
00:19:48,098 --> 00:19:48,931
- Me too.
- Alright.

584
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:50,295
- Good to see you brother.
- It was good.

585
00:19:50,295 --> 00:19:51,128
- I enjoyed that.

586
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:52,842
- Thank you so much brother
thank you for having us.

587
00:19:52,842 --> 00:19:56,842
- And is LA or New York
or any city that I know?

588
00:19:58,236 --> 00:19:59,735
- I prefer New York.

589
00:19:59,735 --> 00:20:01,552
But I love Tokyo.

590
00:20:01,552 --> 00:20:03,879
(laughter)

591
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:06,605
I mean it's fun, it's fun.

592
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:10,772
I say quietly to Mike that
I prefer New York to LA.

593
00:20:12,597 --> 00:20:13,430
Let's do it.

594
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,347
- It's my cool picture.

595
00:20:16,797 --> 00:20:18,346
- [Man] Good stuff, cool.

596
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:19,591
- Alright.

597
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:23,998
- I need to feel the short
term and the long term

598
00:20:23,998 --> 00:20:25,843
and then I can really do some stuff.

599
00:20:25,843 --> 00:20:26,846
- Okay.

600
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:27,849
- We'll figure it out.

601
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:29,883
And arrange something because
I wanna freak all of you out.

602
00:20:29,883 --> 00:20:31,876
- I will, we'll, you know
what, that's what we'll do,

603
00:20:31,876 --> 00:20:33,409
why don't we arrange something right away

604
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:34,868
for a company event

605
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:38,654
and then we'll spend the hour
and a half after we'll talk.

606
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,148
I mean here's the punchline.

607
00:20:40,148 --> 00:20:42,991
Why Lindsay's here is
we're building something

608
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:46,960
that is the future of all this
which is what D Rock's doing.

609
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,127
It's a human production company
and I don't need to sell it,

610
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:55,202
I need to show it to you guys

611
00:20:55,202 --> 00:20:57,363
and then we'll figure out what that means.

612
00:20:57,363 --> 00:20:58,367
- I just had fun with it.

613
00:20:58,367 --> 00:20:59,329
- Yeah okay.

614
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:00,625
- I had a blast thanks
for taking your time.

615
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,876
- Of course great to see
you have a great day.

616
00:21:01,876 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
