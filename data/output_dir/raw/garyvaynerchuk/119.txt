1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,133
- Doing the right thing
is always the right thing.

2
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:03,108
Always and forever.

3
00:00:03,108 --> 00:00:05,775
(hip hop music)

4
00:00:09,814 --> 00:00:10,895
Hey Vlog,

5
00:00:10,895 --> 00:00:12,005
this will be a good one.

6
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:12,838
Late Sunday night,

7
00:00:12,838 --> 00:00:13,870
very rare for me to leave the family

8
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,445
but this is for a good cause.

9
00:00:15,445 --> 00:00:18,210
Obviously, the devastation in Puerto Rico.

10
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,825
My family has spent a lot of time there,

11
00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:21,208
I do a lot of business.

12
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:25,371
I've done a lot of business
with people from there.

13
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:26,323
Eytan here,

14
00:00:26,323 --> 00:00:27,518
the owner of Hunt and Fish Club

15
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:28,881
(bell ding)
you've seen it

16
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:29,714
in different vlogs.

17
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:30,805
I haven't been here much lately.

18
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:32,387
But you've seen him in other vlogs.

19
00:00:32,387 --> 00:00:35,629
Very friendly with Jorge
Posada and asked me to

20
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:37,515
be a major player and
so I decided to co-host.

21
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:38,348
Step up,

22
00:00:38,348 --> 00:00:39,693
gonna be a lot of Vayner people tonight.

23
00:00:39,693 --> 00:00:43,043
That'd be fun to interview
some of them, D-Rock.

24
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,963
And, just really,

25
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:47,379
any time you can do something
for a worthwhile cause

26
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:48,212
like,

27
00:00:48,212 --> 00:00:49,839
as you guys know I don't tend to show

28
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:50,672
a lot of my charity, water,

29
00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:52,405
Pencils of Promise work or

30
00:00:52,405 --> 00:00:54,144
a lot of the other stuff I do

31
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:56,346
in the nonprofit world.

32
00:00:56,346 --> 00:00:57,751
I kinda grew up in it.

33
00:00:57,751 --> 00:00:58,755
I have a cynical point of view of it

34
00:00:58,755 --> 00:00:59,751
'cause so many of my friends

35
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:01,893
leverage it to show that
they're a good person.

36
00:01:01,893 --> 00:01:04,652
But it is a passionate part of my life,

37
00:01:04,652 --> 00:01:05,485
and so,

38
00:01:06,394 --> 00:01:07,227
I thought it'd be important.

39
00:01:07,227 --> 00:01:08,642
As I'm talking about new things

40
00:01:08,642 --> 00:01:09,930
and showing you guys different things,

41
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,787
I do feel a sense of responsibility

42
00:01:11,787 --> 00:01:12,906
of showing this part as well.

43
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,371
Just a little bit.

44
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:15,310
Still won't push it.

45
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,586
I'm much more comfortable

46
00:01:16,586 --> 00:01:18,566
slingin' my books and my sneakers

47
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:19,498
than kind of like,

48
00:01:19,498 --> 00:01:22,458
the stuff I'm more proud of.

49
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,276
You know, like you guys
know a lot of this stuff.

50
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:25,340
But anyway, nonetheless,

51
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,490
fun stuff.

52
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,514
Looking forward to it.

53
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:29,650
Bunch of athletes in the building,

54
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,831
bunch of VaynerMedia
employees in the building.

55
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:32,829
That's a win-win situation.

56
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:34,301
Jets just lost to Tampa Bay,

57
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:35,636
so I'm a little bit bummed,

58
00:01:35,636 --> 00:01:38,499
that pretty much officially
wraps up their season.

59
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:40,267
You know, but,

60
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,211
great trip, obviously as you guys know.

61
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:45,260
This is two days before
the sneaker launch,

62
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,331
probably air right after it.

63
00:01:47,331 --> 00:01:48,325
So I just wanna,

64
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:49,398
I'll just pre-empt it.

65
00:01:49,398 --> 00:01:50,619
I'll go a little future here.

66
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:52,979
I wanna thank everybody
who supported me on that,

67
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,635
and wished me a 42nd happy birthday.

68
00:01:55,635 --> 00:01:58,277
And hopefully D-Rock will get some

69
00:01:58,277 --> 00:01:59,790
rad, rad content.

70
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,651
Is Baban coming too?

71
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:01,868
- [Man] Nah, he's editing.

72
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:02,741
- He's editing.

73
00:02:02,741 --> 00:02:05,363
Hopefully D-Rock will
capture some rad content.

74
00:02:05,363 --> 00:02:08,530
(festive piano music)

75
00:02:12,236 --> 00:02:13,966
Patience would probably be

76
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:15,155
the biggest thing that I would tell him.

77
00:02:15,155 --> 00:02:15,988
- Really?

78
00:02:15,988 --> 00:02:16,821
- Sure.

79
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:17,654
Mom and dad want him to do well,

80
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:18,734
and he wants to do well.

81
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:20,780
The reality is, he's a kid.

82
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,877
- Well no, this is my old one.

83
00:02:21,877 --> 00:02:22,731
He's 22.

84
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:23,772
- He's a fuckin' kid.

85
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:24,732
- Yeah he's a kid.

86
00:02:24,732 --> 00:02:25,795
- 22's a fuckin' kid!
- Okay!

87
00:02:25,795 --> 00:02:26,764
- We're barely,

88
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:28,772
you know, it's hard
when you're the parent.

89
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:29,605
- Right.

90
00:02:29,605 --> 00:02:30,932
- Because you want him to be
settled and in a good place

91
00:02:30,932 --> 00:02:31,803
and you love him.

92
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:32,636
- Right.

93
00:02:32,636 --> 00:02:33,564
- 22's a kid.

94
00:02:33,564 --> 00:02:36,244
The cliche thing, like
a mom of a 22 year old

95
00:02:36,244 --> 00:02:37,301
is worried about,

96
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:40,260
it's dramatically less of an issue

97
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,923
than I think you would realize.

98
00:02:41,923 --> 00:02:42,756
- Really?

99
00:02:42,756 --> 00:02:43,589
- Mm-hmm!

100
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:44,422
He could do,

101
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:45,860
both of those boys could
do nothing right to 30.

102
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,693
Nothing.

103
00:02:46,693 --> 00:02:47,526
And still be kids.

104
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:48,532
The way I see the world,

105
00:02:48,532 --> 00:02:51,532
there's so much opportunity, because

106
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:54,500
the world is completely misunderstanding

107
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,667
what's actually happening.

108
00:02:57,658 --> 00:02:59,504
The entire world trades on Facebook,

109
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:00,835
Instagram and YouTube.

110
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:02,712
And then it feeds to everything else.

111
00:03:02,712 --> 00:03:04,920
It's all happening in here.

112
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,224
This is the world.

113
00:03:06,224 --> 00:03:07,384
There is nothing else.

114
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:08,217
What's up, Lev?

115
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:09,050
- What's up, Gary?

116
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,883
(bell ding)

117
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:11,391
- Good to see you, brother!

118
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,797
Just to see Sid, lookin' so sharp!

119
00:03:12,797 --> 00:03:13,845
This is worth

120
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:16,340
the entire price tag!
(bell ding)

121
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,173
You look great.

122
00:03:17,173 --> 00:03:18,006
- Thank you.

123
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:18,839
- You look great.

124
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:19,725
- How's everything with you, though?

125
00:03:19,725 --> 00:03:20,685
- Real good.

126
00:03:20,685 --> 00:03:22,205
Other than the Jets, my life is awesome!

127
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:23,254
- I know, man!

128
00:03:23,254 --> 00:03:25,268
- Alright, D-Rock, I have bad angle,

129
00:03:25,268 --> 00:03:26,231
bad angle for me.

130
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:28,314
(laughs)

131
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:30,740
I need the good angle!

132
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,684
- [Gary Vaynerchuk] You win,

133
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:33,086
and then everything else works out.

134
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:33,919
You know?

135
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,999
You guys hustlin'?

136
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:36,892
You got businesses goin' on?

137
00:03:36,892 --> 00:03:38,916
What kind of business would you do?

138
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,565
- I'd be a baseball player.

139
00:03:40,565 --> 00:03:42,367
- You'd be a baseball player?

140
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:43,763
Okay, who's your favorite player?

141
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:45,381
- Aaron Judge.

142
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:47,333
- Aaron Judge, makes sense.

143
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,445
What kind of business would you have?

144
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:49,362
- Musician.

145
00:03:50,285 --> 00:03:51,821
- Musician.

146
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:52,654
Like who?

147
00:03:52,654 --> 00:03:54,301
Who's your favorite musician?

148
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:55,134
- Green Day.

149
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:55,967
- Green Day?

150
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:56,800
- Yeah.

151
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,118
- That's a good fuckin' answer, my man!

152
00:03:58,118 --> 00:03:58,951
I like that.

153
00:03:58,951 --> 00:03:59,784
Same?

154
00:03:59,784 --> 00:04:00,617
- Yeah.

155
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:01,450
- I love that.

156
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,283
You guys having fun?

157
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,116
- Yeah.

158
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:03,949
- Awesome.

159
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,693
Gotta tell the youth

160
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:07,933
that being a baseball
player and a musician

161
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:09,813
is not running a business.

162
00:04:09,813 --> 00:04:10,694
Let's play a little

163
00:04:10,694 --> 00:04:11,621
on the vlog,

164
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:13,045
let's do a little ABC.

165
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,933
Alright, vlog, in the comments,

166
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:16,266
do you prefer A,

167
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:17,958
B,

168
00:04:19,813 --> 00:04:20,646
or C?

169
00:04:24,153 --> 00:04:26,403
I'm gonna bid on some shit.

170
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:31,759
KD, I got you.

171
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:34,499
Double nickels, five 50.

172
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:35,351
- [Man] You're bidding.

173
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:36,184
- I'm bidding!
(bell ding)

174
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:37,017
- What are you bidding on?

175
00:04:37,017 --> 00:04:37,850
- On the little KD jersey, you know?

176
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,683
- Really?

177
00:04:38,683 --> 00:04:39,516
- Yeah!

178
00:04:39,516 --> 00:04:40,349
He's a good entrepreneur!

179
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:41,182
He's a nice

180
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:42,015
basketball player.
- Let me get

181
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:42,848
you guys together!

182
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:43,851
- But he's a good entrepreneur.

183
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:44,684
Big shout out to Draymond Green.

184
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,619
One of my favorites.

185
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,980
Fun fact, I put Draymond on SnapChat.

186
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,079
(laughs)

187
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,094
(upbeat indie-pop music)

188
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:54,820
Like I always say,

189
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,132
you don't need to buy
my sneakers or books.

190
00:04:57,132 --> 00:04:58,392
You do you.

191
00:04:58,392 --> 00:05:01,059
I'm here to force you to do you.

192
00:05:03,057 --> 00:05:03,901
How you doing, D-Rock?

193
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:05,041
- [D-Rock] Really good, how are you?

194
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,208
- Really well.

195
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:09,990
I don't give a fuck.

196
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,823
(laughs)

197
00:05:10,823 --> 00:05:12,409
I actually really want to look like Yoda.

198
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:13,551
And I always have.

199
00:05:13,551 --> 00:05:14,384
- Do,

200
00:05:15,473 --> 00:05:16,306
or do not.

201
00:05:17,362 --> 00:05:18,856
There is no try.

202
00:05:18,856 --> 00:05:19,697
- Grapes, D-Rock,

203
00:05:19,697 --> 00:05:21,210
grapes, grapes.

204
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,097
Don't worry, Jordan.

205
00:05:22,097 --> 00:05:22,930
You will?

206
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,025
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thanks for coming!

207
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:25,411
- I sprained my ankle yesterday,

208
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:26,244
but,

209
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:27,077
we made it!

210
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:27,910
- Yeah.

211
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,743
- Doing what?

212
00:05:28,743 --> 00:05:29,576
- Flag football!

213
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:30,674
- Called the game winning sites now.

214
00:05:30,674 --> 00:05:32,172
- Make sure that makes the vlog!

215
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:33,005
(laughs)

216
00:05:33,005 --> 00:05:34,553
I am so proud of her right now!

217
00:05:34,553 --> 00:05:36,372
I don't know if I've ever been more

218
00:05:36,372 --> 00:05:38,513
proud of a VaynerMedia employee than that!

219
00:05:38,513 --> 00:05:40,727
- Yeah.
- I'm excited about tonight.

220
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:41,833
- This is awesome!
- This is awesome.

221
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:42,730
- We raised a lot of money.

222
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,147
(reflective piano music)

223
00:05:53,105 --> 00:05:54,457
There's something I'd love to say

224
00:05:54,457 --> 00:05:55,619
and I say it a lot, which is

225
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:57,642
doing the right thing is
always the right thing.

226
00:05:57,642 --> 00:05:58,815
It's super simple,

227
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:01,065
but I think more than ever,

228
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:03,795
the people that are fortunate enough,

229
00:06:03,795 --> 00:06:04,870
whether it's financial,

230
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,762
whether it's

231
00:06:05,762 --> 00:06:06,953
there's a lot of people
walking around here

232
00:06:06,953 --> 00:06:08,379
that have attention of others because of

233
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:10,026
the thing I'm passionate about

234
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:11,659
which is social media and
things of that nature.

235
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:12,674
Platforms,

236
00:06:12,674 --> 00:06:14,905
I see a lot of amazing athletes and

237
00:06:14,905 --> 00:06:17,546
incredible entrepreneurs
and business people.

238
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:19,529
I think, more than ever,

239
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:21,217
we need to be thoughtful about

240
00:06:21,217 --> 00:06:22,657
putting our energy,

241
00:06:22,657 --> 00:06:26,849
and I'm a very optimistic,
positive kind of dude.

242
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:28,897
And I think there's a lot
going on in the world.

243
00:06:28,897 --> 00:06:30,329
And I think, look,

244
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:32,699
all of us want to do things
that are the right thing,

245
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,081
and you want to do things
that are authentic to you.

246
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:36,689
And so for me,

247
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:40,545
for me, visiting Puerto Rico so many times

248
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:42,283
from a family standpoint of doing business

249
00:06:42,283 --> 00:06:44,146
with so many entrepreneurs there,

250
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:45,137
it was super easy.

251
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:45,970
Obviously,

252
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,145
when you text me if you told me

253
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:48,587
I had to go to Iowa and milk a cow,

254
00:06:48,587 --> 00:06:49,425
I would do it.

255
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:51,498
But for me it's a little more interesting

256
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:54,561
when it's a little bit closer
and deeper to my heart.

257
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:57,835
It's also super fun for
me tonight specifically,

258
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:00,985
because so many of the people
from VaynerMedia are here.

259
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:02,922
And I want to send a huge
shout out to all of them,

260
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,859
because I love them so much.

261
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:06,276
(applauding)

262
00:07:07,865 --> 00:07:09,466
And look, you know,

263
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:10,457
I'm just humbled to be here.

264
00:07:10,457 --> 00:07:12,241
I appreciate the intro

265
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:14,234
and I appreciate the generosity from

266
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,939
everybody downstairs on the silent auction

267
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:20,188
and I know we have a live auction.

268
00:07:20,188 --> 00:07:21,690
It just means a lot for
you guys to be here.

269
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,888
Sunday nights are not the most convenient.

270
00:07:23,888 --> 00:07:26,489
Two weeks notice is not
the most convenient,

271
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:28,566
and just seeing so many
people go out of their way

272
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:31,185
to be here tonight means
a lot to all of us.

273
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:32,242
So thank you so much.

274
00:07:32,242 --> 00:07:34,445
- We have brought more than 200 patients

275
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:36,705
that needed critical treatment to the U.S.

276
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:38,913
These patients needed chemotherapy,

277
00:07:38,913 --> 00:07:40,437
they needed dialysis,

278
00:07:40,437 --> 00:07:42,379
they needed respirators,

279
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,140
they needed oxygen.

280
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,572
We've taken supplies

281
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:47,844
in more than 13 flights to Puerto Rico.

282
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:51,942
But now, there's still a
lot more that we need to do.

283
00:07:51,942 --> 00:07:53,501
And this is the process that's gonna

284
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:55,388
take a long time.

285
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:57,909
We need clean up, we need rebuilding.

286
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:01,950
And we need to build Puerto
Rico's economy back up.

287
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,396
And that's what we're
gonna do with the funds

288
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:07,462
that all of you have
graciously donated tonight.

289
00:08:07,462 --> 00:08:09,902
And we're gonna continue to do that

290
00:08:09,902 --> 00:08:11,652
until Puerto Rico comes back,

291
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:13,445
stronger than ever.

292
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:16,620
(audience applauding)

293
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,581
- Thank you so much.

294
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,220
Raised a lot of money tonight.

295
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,973
Really, really an amazing night.

296
00:08:20,973 --> 00:08:22,893
- If you do stay 'til midnight,

297
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:25,509
Gary is going to milk an Omaha cow.

298
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:26,668
(laughs)

299
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:27,501
Right here

300
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:29,165
on this stage!
- [Gary] Live, live!

301
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:31,492
- With his feral, dignified
- Live!

302
00:08:31,492 --> 00:08:32,381
- Tweeting hands.

303
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:33,214
- I will do it!

304
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:34,197
I will do it!
- You don't wanna do that

305
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:35,652
at this day and age.
(laughs)

306
00:08:35,652 --> 00:08:37,109
- I'm thrilled to be like, business.

307
00:08:37,109 --> 00:08:39,149
But when giving,

308
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:40,687
giving is giving.

309
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,365
You don't need the accolades.

310
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:44,448
And people blend the two.

311
00:08:45,637 --> 00:08:48,804
(festive dance music)

312
00:08:54,205 --> 00:08:56,538
(bell ding)

313
00:08:58,221 --> 00:08:59,682
(bell ding)

314
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:01,349
- What's happening?!

315
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,032
- It's important to you guys,

316
00:09:06,032 --> 00:09:07,099
I'll make it important to me.

317
00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:08,483
- Thank you.

318
00:09:08,483 --> 00:09:09,393
- Vlog,

319
00:09:09,393 --> 00:09:11,269
Krupa, the best!

320
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:12,871
(bell ding)
If you need a PR company,

321
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:13,845
this is your lady.

322
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,509
Link it up, give her love.

323
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:17,028
She's the best!

324
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:18,932
But it's execution, not idea.

325
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:20,476
- Everything you do,

326
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,044
it means a lot, dude!

327
00:09:22,044 --> 00:09:22,916
- I appreciate that.

328
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,629
- You really changed my life,

329
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:25,462
for real though.

330
00:09:25,462 --> 00:09:26,636
I know you hear it all the time,

331
00:09:26,636 --> 00:09:27,469
but like,

332
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:29,764
the main thing you talk
about that I really fuck with

333
00:09:29,764 --> 00:09:31,140
100 percent is self-awareness.

334
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,815
The realest shit ever.

335
00:09:32,815 --> 00:09:34,315
Realest shit ever.

336
00:09:38,381 --> 00:09:41,881
(piano and hand clapping)

337
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:45,448
(singing)

338
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:50,647
(bell ding)

339
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:56,447
(live R&B influenced pop music)

340
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:03,231
(live singing, piano and acoustic guitar)

341
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:12,462
(bell ding)

342
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,150
(optimistic pop music)

343
00:10:23,713 --> 00:10:25,121
(screaming)

344
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:26,809
- Gary Fucking Vaynerchuk!

345
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:29,642
(audience cheers)

346
00:10:45,473 --> 00:10:46,609
- Did I hear chess talk?

347
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:47,442
- [Man] Yeah, yeah!

348
00:10:47,442 --> 00:10:48,633
- I'm trying, guys!

349
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:49,834
I'm fuckin' hustling!

350
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:50,667
(laughs)

351
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:55,631
I'm fuckin' working 24/7
trying to make it happen!

352
00:10:55,631 --> 00:10:57,362
- [D-Rock] Having a good time tonight,

353
00:10:57,362 --> 00:10:59,025
doing the right thing is
always the right thing?

354
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,314
- Yes.

355
00:11:00,314 --> 00:11:01,754
It's true, D-Rock!

356
00:11:01,754 --> 00:11:03,657
Doing the right thing is
always the right thing.

357
00:11:03,657 --> 00:11:04,788
Always and forever.

358
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:06,298
Life.

359
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,089
Super fuckin' interesting.

360
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:08,922
See ya.

361
00:11:08,922 --> 00:00:00,000
(reflective piano music)
