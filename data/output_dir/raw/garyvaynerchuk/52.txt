1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:03,541
(playful upbeat music)

2
00:00:07,289 --> 00:00:08,122
- How are you guys?

3
00:00:08,122 --> 00:00:08,983
- [Audience] Good!

4
00:00:08,983 --> 00:00:09,933
- Good.

5
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:12,028
So by show of hands how many

6
00:00:12,028 --> 00:00:12,861
of you are...

7
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:13,944
Is my mic on?

8
00:00:15,235 --> 00:00:16,409
Are you guys, It doesn't feel like it.

9
00:00:16,409 --> 00:00:17,242
Do you guys?

10
00:00:17,242 --> 00:00:18,075
Yeah I can go loud.

11
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:21,487
I don't know if you guys
are doing it like before.

12
00:00:21,487 --> 00:00:22,404
No worries.

13
00:00:23,275 --> 00:00:26,165
I don't think I touched it.

14
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:27,595
- [Staff Member] Technical glitch.

15
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:28,428
- No worries.

16
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,225
I can wait a second.

17
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:32,133
(mic thumping)

18
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:33,143
Oh that's right, you're right I did.

19
00:00:33,143 --> 00:00:34,258
I'll take this, can I take this?

20
00:00:34,258 --> 00:00:35,091
Awesome.

21
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:36,487
You're right, sorry.

22
00:00:36,487 --> 00:00:37,527
That's the Daily Vee mic.

23
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:38,360
Sorry about that.

24
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,703
(audience laughs)

25
00:00:39,703 --> 00:00:43,153
By show of hands how many
of you have context for me?

26
00:00:43,153 --> 00:00:44,046
Raise your hands.

27
00:00:44,046 --> 00:00:46,060
And how many don't?

28
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,005
Okay good, so I'll give
you a little background

29
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:48,986
and I'll talk a little bit

30
00:00:48,986 --> 00:00:50,630
and then we'll open it up to Q and A.

31
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,545
'Cause just wanted to get a sense.

32
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:54,378
So I'm an entrepreneur

33
00:00:55,527 --> 00:00:57,430
and I'm an entrepreneur that probably

34
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,459
spends a disproportionate amount of time

35
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,324
looking at consumer behavior

36
00:01:01,324 --> 00:01:04,542
and have basically spent the
last 20, 30 years of my life

37
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:05,911
reverse engineering what I think is

38
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:09,339
actually happening with peoples' attention

39
00:01:09,339 --> 00:01:12,922
and that's what brought me
to email marketing in 1996

40
00:01:12,922 --> 00:01:15,136
when I had 90% open rates.

41
00:01:15,136 --> 00:01:16,476
It's what brought me to Google AdWords

42
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:19,372
the day Google AdWords started
with five cents a click.

43
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:20,887
It's what brought me to YouTube

44
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:22,425
seven months after YouTube started

45
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:24,033
and started one of the big first shows

46
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:26,234
that was longer than a minute.

47
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:28,080
It's what made me an
early investor in Twitter,

48
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,952
and Facebook and Tumblr

49
00:01:29,952 --> 00:01:31,525
and

50
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:32,647
it's my current scene.

51
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:36,771
My intuition on where
you're spending your time

52
00:01:36,771 --> 00:01:39,600
and usually I'm just a little bit faster

53
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,312
than the next guy or gal in
executing on those platforms

54
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,079
and then I spend all my
time trying to figure out

55
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:50,939
how to bring value in
that new paradigm shift.

56
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,988
So, for example, for the
ones that do follow me

57
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,687
you know that I'm very
obsessed with voice right now

58
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:58,299
and so because I believe that Alexa

59
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:00,902
and Google Home and Apple Home Pod

60
00:02:00,902 --> 00:02:02,736
and whatever you know,

61
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:04,093
AliBaba or Tensen

62
00:02:04,093 --> 00:02:06,019
or the big Asian players do

63
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:07,737
that everybody, in six years,

64
00:02:07,737 --> 00:02:11,244
will have a device or the
voice will be in the paint

65
00:02:11,244 --> 00:02:13,083
or in the building but that most of you

66
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:17,680
will be interacting with a
voice activated AI environment.

67
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,884
And, to me, now what do I do?

68
00:02:19,884 --> 00:02:23,582
I've binarily decided that's happening

69
00:02:23,582 --> 00:02:25,499
the same way I binarily
10 years ago thought

70
00:02:25,499 --> 00:02:26,576
the cell phone would be the most

71
00:02:26,576 --> 00:02:28,366
important thing in our lives

72
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:30,718
which is what led me to
betting on the platforms

73
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:33,250
that were being built on top of it.

74
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,372
And I believe in my intuition.

75
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:39,089
I execute within those white spaces

76
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:42,229
and so intuitive understanding
of consumer behavior.

77
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:45,927
Dating sites, in the
2000s, when it was taboo

78
00:02:45,927 --> 00:02:47,927
and now it's mainstream.

79
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:51,555
So believing in my intuition,

80
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:53,931
jumping into new territory,
it's real estate.

81
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:55,511
I'm in the real estate business.

82
00:02:55,511 --> 00:02:58,527
I believe some place is gonna be good.

83
00:02:58,527 --> 00:02:59,841
I start building.

84
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:02,189
I learn the space better
than the next person

85
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:05,846
and I become a player in that domain.

86
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:07,967
Obviously, for a lot of you, it really

87
00:03:07,967 --> 00:03:10,444
became obvious to you in
the social media domain

88
00:03:10,444 --> 00:03:12,027
over the last 10 years

89
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:14,079
but it was happening in the web 1.0

90
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,661
domain with search and AdWords.

91
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:18,484
It was just I was doing
it for a liquor store

92
00:03:18,484 --> 00:03:22,884
behind the scenes and I
was starting from zero.

93
00:03:22,884 --> 00:03:26,861
I think voice is gonna be my third chapter

94
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:27,849
and that's it.

95
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:32,284
And then for you guys I think
a lot about supply and demand.

96
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:35,820
I spent a lot of time on
supply and demand of attention

97
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,653
which is what I've just been

98
00:03:36,653 --> 00:03:38,406
talking about for a few minutes.

99
00:03:38,406 --> 00:03:39,724
And then I also, to be
very frank with you,

100
00:03:39,724 --> 00:03:43,875
think about supply and
demand of entrepreneurs.

101
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,484
There's never been more startups.

102
00:03:46,484 --> 00:03:49,424
Lucky for me 'cause
it's fun and it's cool.

103
00:03:49,424 --> 00:03:52,492
Entrepreneurship has been
put on a huge pedestal.

104
00:03:52,492 --> 00:03:55,722
It is crazy to me that you know,

105
00:03:55,722 --> 00:03:59,089
there's celebrity around entrepreneurship

106
00:03:59,089 --> 00:04:00,227
but that's the case

107
00:04:00,227 --> 00:04:02,889
and that means there's a vulnerability.

108
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:03,722
That means a lot of people that

109
00:04:03,722 --> 00:04:06,443
shouldn't be entrepreneurs are

110
00:04:06,443 --> 00:04:08,005
and what I mean by that
is everybody should try

111
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:08,873
you're more than welcome.

112
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,758
It's just I'm scared that there's

113
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:13,312
a lack of self awareness

114
00:04:13,312 --> 00:04:15,009
and everybody does binary things

115
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:19,059
like the same kids that
blindly went to MBAs

116
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,553
are now blindly doing startups

117
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,085
and let me just remind everybody

118
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:25,818
number 11 at Facebook
made a lot more money

119
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:28,493
than number one in 99% of companies.

120
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:31,326
So when I go into a room like this

121
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:35,368
I'm less worried about marketing
arbitrage of attention.

122
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:38,385
I'm more worried about
are you self aware enough

123
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:42,807
of what kind of founder
or entrepreneur are you?

124
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:45,408
And do you know how to surround yourself

125
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:48,197
with the things that you
need to be successful

126
00:04:48,197 --> 00:04:51,750
instead of blindly thinking
you can do everything?

127
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,212
And then are you doubling down

128
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:56,144
or tripling down on your strengths

129
00:04:56,144 --> 00:04:58,881
and are you putting that pieces together

130
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,661
to be successful in what your ambition is?

131
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:03,506
And are you aware of all the

132
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:05,808
vulnerabilities of what you're doing?

133
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:08,078
And how are you combating those?

134
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:10,387
And, most of all, are
you building a business

135
00:05:10,387 --> 00:05:12,854
based on the way the world is right now

136
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,403
without anticipating what the world's

137
00:05:14,403 --> 00:05:16,471
gonna look like in 36 months

138
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:19,520
by the time you actually have something?

139
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,437
So those are the themes on my mind.

140
00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:26,022
I'd love to kick off with
a little bit of Q and A

141
00:05:26,022 --> 00:05:27,347
and see where you guys take this

142
00:05:27,347 --> 00:05:30,000
and then if I need to jump back in

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,424
and change the tone of conversation

144
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:35,941
I'm happy to do so but does
anybody have a question?

145
00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:36,774
- [Staff Member] So, I know that we have

146
00:05:36,774 --> 00:05:38,668
friends all the way from
Indonesia as well as with

147
00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:41,418
you know people asking questions.

148
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:44,181
Sorry, I just got to open up and ask,

149
00:05:44,181 --> 00:05:47,250
so I just recently got a power profile

150
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,083
on LinkedIn.

151
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:48,916
- Okay.

152
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,924
- [Staff Member] And this
morning I asked my LinkedIn...

153
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:52,269
Because I did have a question for you.

154
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,102
- No worries.

155
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,366
- [Staff Member] So I'm just
gonna take to my LinkedIn

156
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:55,199
real quick.

157
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,032
- Sounds cool.

158
00:05:56,032 --> 00:05:57,039
- [Staff Member] And see
what the question is there.

159
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:57,872
- Cool.

160
00:06:00,206 --> 00:06:01,082
What's your name?

161
00:06:01,082 --> 00:06:03,809
- [Staff Member] My name
is Casey Lane Delapose.

162
00:06:03,809 --> 00:06:07,678
Okay, so this one comes
from Jessica Horgen.

163
00:06:07,678 --> 00:06:12,324
Can you describe a time you
felt lost in your career path?

164
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:13,173
What did you do?

165
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,441
And what was the outcome?

166
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,108
- So I think for me,

167
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,682
I felt super lost the
first 18 years of my life

168
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,634
because I wasn't a student.

169
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,567
And in he 80s and 90s there was

170
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:28,108
no such thing as
entrepreneurship in America.

171
00:06:28,108 --> 00:06:30,511
And the only way that you traded was

172
00:06:30,511 --> 00:06:32,714
based on how good of a student you were.

173
00:06:32,714 --> 00:06:34,099
And so for the first,

174
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:35,657
kind of from six,

175
00:06:35,657 --> 00:06:38,054
kind of from 10 to 18

176
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:40,911
I had a lot of pressure being thrown at me

177
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:44,254
by teachers and parents of my friends

178
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:46,282
that basically painted me as a loser,

179
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:48,303
because I was getting Ds and Fs.

180
00:06:48,303 --> 00:06:49,136
Even though that I was making

181
00:06:49,136 --> 00:06:51,827
3000 dollars on weekends
selling baseball cards,

182
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:53,413
I was "losing".

183
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,677
Which you know,

184
00:06:54,677 --> 00:06:56,293
built up a good skin.

185
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:58,534
Made me very prepared
for entrepreneurship.

186
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:01,743
The only, only time since I was 22

187
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:04,122
for the last 20 years
that I have felt lost

188
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:05,427
was when I knew that it was time

189
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:07,855
for me to transition out
of my family business

190
00:07:07,855 --> 00:07:10,741
and I was worried that it
would hurt my dad's feelings.

191
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:12,316
Right?

192
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:15,187
Luckily, what manifested
in that two to three years

193
00:07:15,187 --> 00:07:17,351
where I was kind of
like starting to build,

194
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:19,851
was my dad also was struggling

195
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:22,638
because I was starting to be

196
00:07:22,638 --> 00:07:25,121
the real operator of his business.

197
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:26,726
And he was feeling less of a man,

198
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:29,123
and less of the man.

199
00:07:29,123 --> 00:07:32,655
So, as that hit a crescendo
point for both of us,

200
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:34,926
it actually became easy
to leave the business

201
00:07:34,926 --> 00:07:36,686
because we were both winning.

202
00:07:36,686 --> 00:07:38,514
He got to be the boss again,

203
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:41,681
and I got to go on to do other things.

204
00:07:43,473 --> 00:07:45,725
I don't want to manifest a bullshit story.

205
00:07:45,725 --> 00:07:48,737
I've never felt lost in operating,

206
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:50,225
this is what I was meant to do.

207
00:07:50,225 --> 00:07:51,713
Probably no different than somebody who's

208
00:07:51,713 --> 00:07:53,437
meant to be a soccer player

209
00:07:53,437 --> 00:07:55,426
or meant to be a musician.

210
00:07:55,426 --> 00:07:57,714
Like I'm pure bred,

211
00:07:57,714 --> 00:07:58,547
you know?

212
00:07:58,547 --> 00:07:59,380
(Audience laughs)

213
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,213
I really am.

214
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,046
I really, really am.

215
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:02,995
I never was capable of doing anything

216
00:08:02,995 --> 00:08:04,731
but selling and branding,

217
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:07,191
and marketing and businessey, busni-bess.

218
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:08,906
Long before

219
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:09,906
it was cool.

220
00:08:10,806 --> 00:08:12,155
So, I got very lucky.

221
00:08:12,155 --> 00:08:13,350
That's why I really push people to do

222
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,103
what they're passionate about.

223
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,317
Because sometimes you get lucky

224
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:18,396
and the world comes to you.

225
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:20,584
And that's absolutely
what's happened to me.

226
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,586
The thing that I always was,

227
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,770
has now become the thing.

228
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,713
And

229
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,796
that's really worked out.

230
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,134
Questions?

231
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,640
And listen,

232
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,548
Just to give you guys context,

233
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:34,059
because I know a lot of
you may not know who I am.

234
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:36,300
I've invested in over 200 startups,

235
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:38,604
like I'm very comfortable answering a very

236
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:40,568
detailed subtle question that you may have

237
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:41,820
on your mind for your business.

238
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,121
Be selfish.

239
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:44,759
That's what Q and A's about.

240
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,400
And a lot of times the question you have

241
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,992
is 60 percent of the audience

242
00:08:47,992 --> 00:08:49,528
is also thinking of a version of it.

243
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:50,943
So, don't feel like you have to

244
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,400
come up with a question
that's valuable to anybody.

245
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,744
Go real selfish, we have some time here.

246
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:56,577
- [Audience Member] Hello.

247
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,410
- Hello.

248
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,243
- [Audience Member] My name is Gwen

249
00:08:58,243 --> 00:08:59,586
and I'm the founder of Sushibit.

250
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:02,067
We help friends to find hired work with

251
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:05,652
social media influences
for marketing things.

252
00:09:05,652 --> 00:09:09,804
So my question is for
personal for my business.

253
00:09:09,804 --> 00:09:12,253
I started this business
last two years ago.

254
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:15,097
And the first year was like fun.

255
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,560
It was a lot of pitching and everything

256
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,921
and very exciting.

257
00:09:17,921 --> 00:09:19,128
And then the second year comes,

258
00:09:19,128 --> 00:09:21,989
and I'm always in the
office coaching people,

259
00:09:21,989 --> 00:09:23,133
scaling the business.

260
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:24,058
- You're managing.

261
00:09:24,058 --> 00:09:24,932
- [Audience Member] So yeah.

262
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:25,765
- You're managing.

263
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:26,598
- [Audience Member] Sort of.

264
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:28,144
So, what is the next thing I cost it?

265
00:09:28,144 --> 00:09:30,205
I've been coaching for six months,

266
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:31,047
and like okay.

267
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:32,143
- Coaching your employees?

268
00:09:32,143 --> 00:09:32,976
- [Audience Member] Yeah.

269
00:09:32,976 --> 00:09:33,809
- Mhm.

270
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:34,905
- [Audience Member]
What is the next thing?

271
00:09:34,905 --> 00:09:36,126
- More coaching.

272
00:09:36,126 --> 00:09:38,123
(Audience laughs)

273
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:39,201
- [Audience Member] Okay.

274
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:40,890
- So here's the real question,

275
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,267
if you don't like it

276
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:45,155
and you like the hunting
and not the farming,

277
00:09:45,155 --> 00:09:47,266
you need to find a farming partner.

278
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:48,099
- [Audience Member] Okay.

279
00:09:48,099 --> 00:09:48,932
- Do you understand?

280
00:09:48,932 --> 00:09:49,765
- [Audience Member] Yeah.

281
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:50,954
Because I'm also the sole founder and a...

282
00:09:50,954 --> 00:09:51,787
- Right.

283
00:09:51,787 --> 00:09:54,533
So that either that comes in
the form of an actual partner,

284
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:57,170
or you bring in a managing director

285
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,252
and she or he is really
good at operational and HR

286
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:02,085
aspects,

287
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:03,373
and you're out building the brand

288
00:10:03,373 --> 00:10:04,804
and hunting for business.

289
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:05,637
- [Audience Member] Yeah.

290
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:06,731
I love the coaching part,

291
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,564
it's just you know,

292
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:10,318
I don't want to always be
there then what's outside.

293
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,848
And I'm missing out and I'm not
doing to make it go further.

294
00:10:13,848 --> 00:10:14,681
- Sure,

295
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:15,931
but I think first of all
you have to deploy patience.

296
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:17,974
When you're small and you can't maybe

297
00:10:17,974 --> 00:10:21,164
afford the proper farming partner,

298
00:10:21,164 --> 00:10:22,918
you've got to eat shit.

299
00:10:22,918 --> 00:10:23,751
(Audience Member laughs)

300
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:24,584
- [Audience Member] Yeah.

301
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:25,566
- You got to make choices.

302
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:26,399
- [Audience Member] Yeah.

303
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,477
- You've got two answers.

304
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:30,966
You either work more

305
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:34,381
so that you hunt from
seven pm to midnight,

306
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:36,381
or, you deploy patience.

307
00:10:38,714 --> 00:10:39,969
- [Audience Member] Good point.

308
00:10:39,969 --> 00:10:42,678
- Cool, but don't underestimate patience.

309
00:10:42,678 --> 00:10:43,525
- [Audience Member] Okay.

310
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:47,275
- Patience is usually
the reason people lose.

311
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:49,328
It's hard.

312
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,411
You have something to prove.

313
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:54,719
You want to get something with the money.

314
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:58,518
You want to scratch the
chip on your shoulder

315
00:10:58,518 --> 00:11:02,129
to prove everybody that
you weren't a loser

316
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,366
because you had Ds and Fs.

317
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:05,899
I understand why patience is hard.

318
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:09,293
But it is absolutely the superpower

319
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,793
of most successful businesses.

320
00:11:13,098 --> 00:11:17,533
And it is something that most
young people never want to do.

321
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:18,366
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

322
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:19,199
- And then you have the subtleties of

323
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:20,583
an Asian culture where's there's a lot

324
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,207
of conflict with parents

325
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:23,586
if you're taking that risk.

326
00:11:23,586 --> 00:11:24,962
So the quicker you're successful,

327
00:11:24,962 --> 00:11:25,795
the quicker you can say,

328
00:11:25,795 --> 00:11:26,644
"See mom."

329
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,969
(Audience laughs)

330
00:11:28,969 --> 00:11:31,143
But a lot of times that becomes the flaw,

331
00:11:31,143 --> 00:11:32,645
because you try to overextend

332
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:34,520
and then you break the whole thing.

333
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,164
So be thoughtful.

334
00:11:36,164 --> 00:11:38,820
You know, the I told you so

335
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,490
ironically is even more sweet

336
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,520
if it takes longer,

337
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,641
because then people are building

338
00:11:43,641 --> 00:11:46,399
more cynicism because
you didn't do it fast.

339
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,174
Which makes it even more fun
when you stick it to them.

340
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:51,775
(Audience laughs)

341
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:52,863
There's nothing more fun

342
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:56,808
then losing 30 to 10 going
to the fourth quarter

343
00:11:56,808 --> 00:11:57,891
then winning.

344
00:11:58,758 --> 00:12:00,793
Too many people want to win 30 to 10

345
00:12:00,793 --> 00:12:03,924
in the first three quarters and then lose.

346
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:06,001
Because it feels better up front.

347
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:08,053
I care about the finish line,

348
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:09,886
not the starting post.

349
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,694
Bjorn.

350
00:12:12,694 --> 00:12:14,532
- [Audience Member] Yes
good eyesight, I agree.

351
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:15,965
- Thank you
- [Audience Member] I'm Bjorn.

352
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:17,054
And I must say that you know,

353
00:12:17,054 --> 00:12:18,355
I follow your videos

354
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:21,604
and you are less mellow and
more thoughtful in person.

355
00:12:21,604 --> 00:12:22,437
- I agree.

356
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:24,512
(Audience laughs)

357
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:25,345
I agree.

358
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:27,673
It's a really good insight.

359
00:12:27,673 --> 00:12:28,842
And I'll tell you this Bjorn,

360
00:12:28,842 --> 00:12:31,840
if there was a thousand
people here, I wouldn't.

361
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,303
I think the context drives my behavior.

362
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:37,046
I'm always listening right?

363
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:38,917
So when Drock and I are on camera,

364
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:41,760
I'm envisioning 400,000 people,

365
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,063
which drives my energy up.

366
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,643
You think this is thoughtful and mellow,

367
00:12:45,643 --> 00:12:47,325
you should have dinner
with me for two hours.

368
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:48,587
(Audience laughs)

369
00:12:48,587 --> 00:12:49,420
You know what I mean?

370
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,161
And so the context is always
the driver of my behavior.

371
00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:53,994
- [Audience Member] If
that was a real question,

372
00:12:53,994 --> 00:12:54,975
I would say yes.

373
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:55,841
- What's that? (laughs)

374
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,981
(Audience laughs)

375
00:12:57,981 --> 00:12:58,814
- [Audience Member] Okay,
I think we got to run

376
00:12:58,814 --> 00:13:00,742
a meditation start up called Mifi.

377
00:13:00,742 --> 00:13:01,771
- I'm already interested.

378
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:02,604
- [Audience Member] I know,

379
00:13:02,604 --> 00:13:03,437
because you talk about this being

380
00:13:03,437 --> 00:13:04,734
a trillion dollar industry.

381
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:07,847
- I believe it's the biggest space for

382
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:10,390
consumer behavior going
into the next decade.

383
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,555
As a consumer product,

384
00:13:11,555 --> 00:13:13,899
the way fitness was in the 90s.

385
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:14,732
- [Audience Member] Yeah.

386
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:15,982
And I also,

387
00:13:15,982 --> 00:13:18,775
found this video information a year ago

388
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:19,891
where you had this switch

389
00:13:19,891 --> 00:13:21,077
where you talked about

390
00:13:21,077 --> 00:13:23,620
you weren't so hot on meditation

391
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,307
about a year ago.

392
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:26,652
- Me doing meditation?

393
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:27,917
- [Audience Member] Yes,
you doing meditation.

394
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:28,883
- And I'm still not.

395
00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:29,716
- [Audience Member] Yes.

396
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:31,593
- I did do it once on a podcast for fun,

397
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:33,053
but I've never done it since.

398
00:13:33,053 --> 00:13:33,886
- [Audience Member] Right,

399
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:34,773
so I'm really curious

400
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,678
which brings me to my question.

401
00:13:36,678 --> 00:13:37,877
As a non-meditator...

402
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:38,710
- Yes.

403
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,543
- [Audience Member] What makes you excited

404
00:13:39,543 --> 00:13:41,108
about this space?

405
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:43,412
What are some key trends based on,

406
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:45,292
that you think on.

407
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:48,573
- So I don't think the
person that observes things

408
00:13:48,573 --> 00:13:51,461
has to be a user of those things,

409
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:53,219
or look like the person that you know,

410
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:56,346
some of the greatest coaches in athletics

411
00:13:56,346 --> 00:13:58,353
never played the game.

412
00:13:58,353 --> 00:14:02,714
So it's about the ability to
synthesize the psychology.

413
00:14:02,714 --> 00:14:04,382
Why am I so excited about it?

414
00:14:04,382 --> 00:14:08,134
Because the brain is the operating
system of the human being

415
00:14:08,134 --> 00:14:11,370
and we haven't even begun to explore it.

416
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,650
Because we've lived in such an environment

417
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,233
of prosperity in the world

418
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:19,798
that we are now into
second and third generation

419
00:14:19,798 --> 00:14:21,889
wealth in a lot of places.

420
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:25,866
Which means we have
anxiety about dumb shit.

421
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,551
Which leads us to these kind of trends.

422
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:30,843
I think we've become more educated about

423
00:14:30,843 --> 00:14:34,460
our health from a physical
and food standpoint.

424
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,174
And that humans are incredible.

425
00:14:37,174 --> 00:14:39,238
We're survivors.

426
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:40,661
I always bet on humans.

427
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:43,553
Even when I'm scared about
macro political issues

428
00:14:43,553 --> 00:14:46,228
in North Korea, US, China.

429
00:14:46,228 --> 00:14:47,640
I always say to myself,

430
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,848
the fact that we're still here

431
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:50,941
is something you have to bet on.

432
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:54,199
And we've gotten better
in our life expectancy.

433
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:56,989
And I believe that
meditation is the unlock

434
00:14:56,989 --> 00:14:58,878
of the next chapter.

435
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:01,642
That people will live longer and happier

436
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:05,480
once they start really
getting into that game.

437
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,131
And I'll be very honest with you,

438
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:10,069
I think I was born gifted.

439
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:13,085
I think I'm meditating while
I'm talking to you right now.

440
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:15,552
I think I feel like I'm a tough read.

441
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:18,572
I'm an enigma, because of my personality.

442
00:15:18,572 --> 00:15:20,342
But I think the people
that know me better,

443
00:15:20,342 --> 00:15:22,289
or have been around a little bit longer

444
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,951
have a pretty good read in my groundness.

445
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:28,268
I'm balanced in my extremities.

446
00:15:28,268 --> 00:15:32,435
And so I know the benefits
of a very peaceful mind.

447
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:35,297
I think maybe it was handed to me,

448
00:15:35,297 --> 00:15:37,341
or the circumstances handed it to me.

449
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:39,093
But I wish it on everybody.

450
00:15:39,093 --> 00:15:42,527
And if meditation is a
gateway to that feeling,

451
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:45,780
which I believe intuitively it could be.

452
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,656
It's going to be a big deal.

453
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:48,786
Now,

454
00:15:48,786 --> 00:15:51,036
anytime something's a big deal,

455
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:52,851
business people come in.

456
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:53,986
(Audience laughs)

457
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,447
And so you're gonna have a lot of

458
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:58,884
people from these parts of the world.

459
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:00,584
India, other places where this has been

460
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,115
common culture for a long time

461
00:16:03,115 --> 00:16:06,220
who are going to be mad at the American

462
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,922
you know, business DNA
of turning meditation

463
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:11,202
into SoulCycle and Coca-cola.

464
00:16:11,202 --> 00:16:13,304
But that is what's gonna happen.

465
00:16:13,304 --> 00:16:16,222
And I look at that as a positive,

466
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:17,657
because I think anything that gets

467
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:20,815
a lot more people into a
good place is just good.

468
00:16:20,815 --> 00:16:22,301
And if some people have
to make a lot of money

469
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:23,573
to make that happen,

470
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:25,201
I'm cool with that too
because I like capitalism,

471
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:26,342
I think it's interesting.

472
00:16:26,342 --> 00:16:27,175
So,

473
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:31,423
it's as black and white
as any trend for me.

474
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,346
More than I think that the
sun will come up tomorrow,

475
00:16:34,346 --> 00:16:36,558
do I believe that
meditation is going to be

476
00:16:36,558 --> 00:16:38,802
a very substantial commerce trade

477
00:16:38,802 --> 00:16:41,219
over the next 30 to 40 years.

478
00:16:42,356 --> 00:16:45,204
Now it becomes the next question,

479
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,799
what are you gonna do about that?

480
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,126
What is somebody who
here just got inspired

481
00:16:50,126 --> 00:16:51,211
gonna do about that?

482
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:54,260
Are you gonna be the fashion brand?

483
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,617
Are you gonna be the app?

484
00:16:56,617 --> 00:17:00,648
Are you gonna be the food compliment too?

485
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:03,179
Are you gonna be the studio location?

486
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:06,847
Are you gonna build the
high luxury retreats?

487
00:17:06,847 --> 00:17:11,014
What are you gonna do about
that, is the question.

488
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:12,976
- [Audience Member] Maybe
we can talk about that,

489
00:17:12,976 --> 00:17:13,809
over dinner.

490
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:14,642
(Audience laughs)

491
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:16,574
- Thrilled. (laughs)

492
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:17,406
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

493
00:17:17,406 --> 00:17:18,846
- You're welcome.

494
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,680
Questions?

495
00:17:27,836 --> 00:17:29,501
- [Audience Member] Hey Gary, I'm Sam.

496
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:30,334
- Hey Sam.

497
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:31,167
- [Audience Member]
There's a couple of things

498
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:33,406
that you talked about already

499
00:17:33,406 --> 00:17:34,477
that resonated with me

500
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:36,005
and go to a question that
I was gonna ask anyway.

501
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:36,838
- Great.

502
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:38,259
- [Audience Member] You just
been talking about happiness.

503
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:39,092
- Yes.

504
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,743
- [Audience Member] And you're
interested in happiness,

505
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:43,088
so personally my background is,

506
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:44,902
I started out in a corporate job,

507
00:17:44,902 --> 00:17:46,275
and after that I got into entrepreneurs

508
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:47,276
and worked on startups,

509
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:50,179
I was basically that person
you were talking about.

510
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:51,751
The farmer ability in the market

511
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:53,431
in terms of getting involved in startups.

512
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:54,453
And I didn't take kind to it,

513
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:56,126
I really quickly said that was

514
00:17:56,126 --> 00:17:57,388
no longer the cool thing to do.

515
00:17:57,388 --> 00:18:00,278
I wasn't the natural part for people.

516
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:02,047
So I started with what
a lot of people think of

517
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,926
as quite a boring job,

518
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:05,560
and then I moved into jobs
that a lot of people knew

519
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,972
were very interesting.

520
00:18:06,972 --> 00:18:07,907
And that's what I do now,

521
00:18:07,907 --> 00:18:08,784
I work with a lot of startups.

522
00:18:08,784 --> 00:18:10,965
And I do a lot of
interesting stuff personally,

523
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:11,798
I love it.

524
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:14,887
This means I get a lot of
people reaching out to me

525
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:16,869
to figure out how to do it themselves,

526
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:18,445
effectively to do correct transitions.

527
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:19,381
- Understood.

528
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:20,214
- [Audience Member] So...

529
00:18:20,214 --> 00:18:21,622
- And do you now see that a white space

530
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:23,468
that you want to play in?

531
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:24,301
- [Audience Member] Not especially.

532
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:25,134
- Okay.

533
00:18:25,134 --> 00:18:25,967
- [Audience Member]
There's a lot of people who

534
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:26,800
are jumping on it.

535
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,633
- That's right.

536
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:28,466
- [Audience Member] Because
it's a massive market there.

537
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:29,299
- Of course.

538
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:30,132
- [Audience Member] Personally--

539
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:31,442
- Most people are unhappy.

540
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:32,275
- [Audience Member] Correct.

541
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:33,108
(Audience laughs)

542
00:18:33,108 --> 00:18:34,796
So this is where my question goes.

543
00:18:34,796 --> 00:18:35,629
- Sure.

544
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:36,462
- [Audience Member] Because something that

545
00:18:36,462 --> 00:18:39,285
I think resonates with most
about audio content for me

546
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,720
is your sort of focus on Legacy.

547
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,553
- Yes.

548
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:44,636
- [Audience Member] Personally for me,

549
00:18:44,636 --> 00:18:46,170
that's my biggest focus too.

550
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,003
- Cool.

551
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:48,171
- [Audience Member] And
I've took it a long time

552
00:18:48,171 --> 00:18:49,297
to figure this out.

553
00:18:49,297 --> 00:18:51,679
To go through my sort of
professional gratification

554
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,456
and happiness, what makes me happy.

555
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:55,070
And what it all comes back to is,

556
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,144
the most important thing
for me is my happiness.

557
00:18:58,144 --> 00:18:58,977
- Yes.

558
00:18:58,977 --> 00:19:01,366
- [Audience Member] Can I
separate personal professional

559
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:02,342
when you're talking about happiness right?

560
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:03,385
- That's exactly right.

561
00:19:03,385 --> 00:19:05,445
- [Audience Member] So I am,

562
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,817
acutely clear on this personally.

563
00:19:07,817 --> 00:19:08,650
- That's good.

564
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,870
- [Audience Member] But I'm
talking to a lot of people

565
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,703
who aren't.

566
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:11,536
- That's right.

567
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:12,369
- [Audience Member]
They're asking me for help

568
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:13,360
to transition into new interesting jobs.

569
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,784
- That's right.

570
00:19:14,784 --> 00:19:16,885
- [Audience Member] One
thing I'm struggling with

571
00:19:16,885 --> 00:19:18,994
when I speak to these people

572
00:19:18,994 --> 00:19:21,438
is sort of breaking through that wall,

573
00:19:21,438 --> 00:19:23,552
which basically took me a few years

574
00:19:23,552 --> 00:19:24,635
to be able to

575
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:27,980
really focus on obviously,

576
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,471
what are your drivers.

577
00:19:30,471 --> 00:19:31,893
- It's radical candor.

578
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:32,726
- [Audience Member] Yeah.

579
00:19:32,726 --> 00:19:34,176
- It's pressure.

580
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:37,338
You know, it's where
people confuse my content.

581
00:19:37,338 --> 00:19:40,554
Where people struggle with me out front,

582
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,746
is I'm making them uncomfortable.

583
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:45,996
Because I'm suffocating their bullshit.

584
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:48,677
- [Audience Member] So this
is something I struggle with,

585
00:19:48,677 --> 00:19:49,841
is being able to--

586
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:51,219
- I get it.

587
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:52,574
It's because you're at a place

588
00:19:52,574 --> 00:19:55,300
where I used to be
probably at some point too,

589
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,085
it's tough for me to recall.

590
00:19:58,085 --> 00:20:00,877
You're playing empathy, you're a good guy.

591
00:20:00,877 --> 00:20:03,697
It's not fun to be disliked.

592
00:20:03,697 --> 00:20:07,452
Like, I don't like being
disliked on first impression.

593
00:20:07,452 --> 00:20:09,533
I just know it's my responsibility

594
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:11,939
because I have a gift of communication

595
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:16,612
and now I feel almost a
sense of responsibility.

596
00:20:16,612 --> 00:20:17,445
You know?

597
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:20,390
I mean the answer is self awareness,

598
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,830
to all

599
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,477
questions.

600
00:20:23,477 --> 00:20:27,588
If you have excitement or
energy towards helping people

601
00:20:27,588 --> 00:20:30,751
whether professionally
or just kind of random,

602
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:34,043
the answer is radical
candor and suffocation.

603
00:20:34,043 --> 00:20:36,288
Which is not a normal

604
00:20:36,288 --> 00:20:37,501
trait

605
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:38,773
for a lot of people.

606
00:20:38,773 --> 00:20:40,606
I hate being disliked.

607
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:44,581
Which is crazy because a lot of

608
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:46,664
the way I roll publicly,

609
00:20:46,664 --> 00:20:49,004
creates 25 to 40 percent

610
00:20:49,004 --> 00:20:51,254
dislike on initial contact.

611
00:20:52,476 --> 00:20:54,726
But I'm gonna win in legacy

612
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:57,282
because I get a hundred emails a week.

613
00:20:57,282 --> 00:21:01,357
A hundred emails a week
that just start with,

614
00:21:01,357 --> 00:21:03,553
I first started hating you.

615
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,024
How many people here consume my content

616
00:21:05,024 --> 00:21:06,828
in any shape or form, raise your hands.

617
00:21:06,828 --> 00:21:08,433
High, I want everybody to see this.

618
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,470
High, higher, don't be scared.

619
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,488
Okay.

620
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:14,446
How many of you the first time you saw me,

621
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:16,488
though I was a bullshit
artist or didn't love it.

622
00:21:16,488 --> 00:21:17,686
Raise your hands.

623
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:20,603
This is a very interesting insight.

624
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,191
But you know what's cool about legacy?

625
00:21:25,191 --> 00:21:26,358
It's truthful.

626
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:30,488
And so, I would tell you that

627
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:33,454
if you're trading on legacy,

628
00:21:33,454 --> 00:21:34,871
you will start gaining,

629
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:37,502
just in the same way that
you realize that, me too,

630
00:21:37,502 --> 00:21:40,299
you'll start gaining sharper edges

631
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,687
to get people there quicker

632
00:21:42,687 --> 00:21:46,135
because you could bounce
around and pander with it,

633
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:48,608
or you could just get
right to the punchline.

634
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:50,350
And getting to the punchline

635
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,575
is the beginning of the
process of them winning.

636
00:21:54,575 --> 00:21:56,379
- [Audience Member] I
think that's great insight.

637
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:57,972
A sort of step further...

638
00:21:57,972 --> 00:21:58,805
- Go ahead.

639
00:21:58,805 --> 00:21:59,989
- [Audience Member]
Is, if I am straight in

640
00:21:59,989 --> 00:22:01,106
there with a punchline,

641
00:22:01,106 --> 00:22:03,594
if I'm just crafting
down on radical candor

642
00:22:03,594 --> 00:22:04,985
and people will block it out

643
00:22:04,985 --> 00:22:05,818
as they do.
- A hundred percent.

644
00:22:05,818 --> 00:22:06,651
- [Audience Member] They don't want to

645
00:22:06,651 --> 00:22:07,484
take me seriously right?

646
00:22:07,484 --> 00:22:09,091
They say, "What happened,
that's not my situation."

647
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:09,924
They're not getting...

648
00:22:09,924 --> 00:22:12,014
- That's why you've got to roll with honey

649
00:22:12,014 --> 00:22:14,109
and then vinegar right?

650
00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:15,478
You know it's like being a fighter.

651
00:22:15,478 --> 00:22:16,922
It's like MMA.

652
00:22:16,922 --> 00:22:17,755
Right?

653
00:22:17,755 --> 00:22:19,142
You've gotta, you know this.

654
00:22:19,142 --> 00:22:20,295
Like I can even tell,

655
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:22,845
you've got to throw
different kind of angles.

656
00:22:22,845 --> 00:22:25,625
The other question is you know,

657
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:26,458
my dad,

658
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,233
I've worked on him more
than any person on earth.

659
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:31,963
It's not gonna happen.

660
00:22:31,963 --> 00:22:36,130
So like, some people prefer to
live within their non truth.

661
00:22:38,251 --> 00:22:39,287
- [Audience Member] So then you move on?

662
00:22:39,287 --> 00:22:40,811
- Then you move on.

663
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:43,560
Now, there's different ways to move on.

664
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,652
It's not like you cut
them out of your life.

665
00:22:45,652 --> 00:22:47,030
But you have to be also self aware

666
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,099
and accept things as well.

667
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:52,223
There's only so much one can do.

668
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:53,056
You know?

669
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,573
- [Audience Member] I appreciate that.

670
00:22:55,573 --> 00:22:56,656
- You got it.

671
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:00,920
It's a super interesting thing man.

672
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,177
What's crazy is that I think
technology is exposing us.

673
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:07,124
It's unbelievable how
I see this whole thing,

674
00:23:07,124 --> 00:23:08,205
and I'm putting it on film.

675
00:23:08,205 --> 00:23:10,803
I will not be able to see this be true.

676
00:23:10,803 --> 00:23:14,273
I believe the next 50 years
is a giant step backwards

677
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:16,395
for human beings in the short term,

678
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,846
because we're about to be
exposed to who we actually are,

679
00:23:18,846 --> 00:23:22,422
and we're not gonna like a
lot of things that we see.

680
00:23:22,422 --> 00:23:23,255
Right?

681
00:23:23,255 --> 00:23:24,088
That's Brexit, that's Trump,

682
00:23:24,088 --> 00:23:25,736
that's a lot of the stuff.

683
00:23:25,736 --> 00:23:28,019
I think though that's gonna put us

684
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:30,811
in a hundred year macro
much further along.

685
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:33,513
Because once we actually get to that point

686
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:36,216
we're gonna start fixing it.

687
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:39,516
So, I think it's gonna
be super interesting.

688
00:23:39,516 --> 00:23:40,349
- [Audience Member] Hello.

689
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:41,182
- Hello.

690
00:23:41,182 --> 00:23:42,015
- [Audience Member] Hi my name is Sarah.

691
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:42,848
- How are you?

692
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,158
- [Audience Member] I'm good, how are you?

693
00:23:44,158 --> 00:23:45,310
- Good.

694
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,856
- [Audience Member] I
ran out of content partly

695
00:23:46,856 --> 00:23:48,927
between industry and most of the time

696
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,808
dealing with content for friends.

697
00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:51,641
- Yes.

698
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:53,425
- [Audience Member] While
I love the craft of it,

699
00:23:53,425 --> 00:23:55,698
and getting deep into
the insights of people

700
00:23:55,698 --> 00:23:58,123
and as you said, what makes them stop

701
00:23:58,123 --> 00:23:59,763
and pay attention to trends.

702
00:23:59,763 --> 00:24:00,863
- Yes.

703
00:24:00,863 --> 00:24:01,865
- [Audience Member] A problem that I have,

704
00:24:01,865 --> 00:24:03,117
a struggle that I have is

705
00:24:03,117 --> 00:24:05,867
usually I serve them
questions from the trends.

706
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:09,238
- Yeah, the clients are the problem.

707
00:24:09,238 --> 00:24:10,071
- [Audience Member] How do you mention

708
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:11,382
the conversion to sales?

709
00:24:11,382 --> 00:24:13,669
And I think it's even more of a struggle

710
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:15,825
when you don't have the
digital infrastructure

711
00:24:15,825 --> 00:24:16,810
as a place to measure that.

712
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,643
- Correct.

713
00:24:17,643 --> 00:24:18,944
- [Audience Member] And
even more so in the end

714
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,162
on the plain company.

715
00:24:20,162 --> 00:24:20,995
- Correct.

716
00:24:20,995 --> 00:24:22,243
- [Audience Member] So what
are your thoughts on that?

717
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:23,603
- Well, the first thing
I do in that scenario

718
00:24:23,603 --> 00:24:25,411
which is a very tricky one,

719
00:24:25,411 --> 00:24:26,590
is I ask them how they measure

720
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,616
all the bullshit they're actually doing.

721
00:24:28,616 --> 00:24:30,496
(Audience laughs)

722
00:24:30,496 --> 00:24:31,329
Right?

723
00:24:31,329 --> 00:24:32,750
So, whatever you're talking about right,

724
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,686
let's talk about a fashion retail

725
00:24:34,686 --> 00:24:36,993
or brick and mortar store.

726
00:24:36,993 --> 00:24:39,159
They can be mad at me that the metrics

727
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:41,036
don't prove to them that the pictures

728
00:24:41,036 --> 00:24:43,765
on Instagram and Facebook sell blouses.

729
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:45,244
And I'm empathetic to that.

730
00:24:45,244 --> 00:24:47,298
Though I'm more than capable of driving

731
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:50,376
a transactional sale
versus a branding sale.

732
00:24:50,376 --> 00:24:52,255
Which is a more short term play

733
00:24:52,255 --> 00:24:53,382
than a long term play.

734
00:24:53,382 --> 00:24:54,685
I'm thrilled.

735
00:24:54,685 --> 00:24:56,516
But before I even let them beat me up

736
00:24:56,516 --> 00:24:59,180
on the lack of metrics of my environment,

737
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,821
I ask them to tell me how they justify

738
00:25:01,821 --> 00:25:04,798
the print and outdoor that they do.

739
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:07,061
The answer is, they don't have an answer.

740
00:25:07,061 --> 00:25:08,965
They've just accepted it.

741
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,255
It's kind of like religion.

742
00:25:11,255 --> 00:25:12,244
Right?

743
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,170
So I'm okay with that.

744
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,365
My answer to your question is very simple.

745
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:18,943
You have to understand that
you're in client services.

746
00:25:18,943 --> 00:25:21,596
Which means you're not the
ultimate decision maker.

747
00:25:21,596 --> 00:25:23,177
Which means you have
to deal in the reality

748
00:25:23,177 --> 00:25:24,720
of what you're dealing with.

749
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,663
I don't have a single client

750
00:25:26,663 --> 00:25:28,691
of the 115 million dollars in revenue

751
00:25:28,691 --> 00:25:30,329
that VaynerMedia will make this year,

752
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:32,099
that spends their money they way I would

753
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:34,169
if I ran their business.

754
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:35,002
(tongue click)

755
00:25:35,002 --> 00:25:36,467
And I'm Gary V.

756
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:37,514
(Audience laughs)

757
00:25:37,514 --> 00:25:38,483
Zero.

758
00:25:38,483 --> 00:25:41,398
So, I think that you have to be accepting

759
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:43,252
of the reality of the situation.

760
00:25:43,252 --> 00:25:47,237
But never waver from you
strategic point of view.

761
00:25:47,237 --> 00:25:50,682
I've never accepted that
bull crap from a client.

762
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,329
I will always push back on my belief.

763
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:55,497
And I let the chips fall where they may.

764
00:25:55,497 --> 00:25:56,330
Whether we don't,

765
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,163
do you know how many,

766
00:25:57,163 --> 00:25:59,919
we don't ever win business pitches

767
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,170
because we just get handed business

768
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,973
because if we're actually going up

769
00:26:03,973 --> 00:26:04,856
against somebody else,

770
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:07,861
we are not the consumable agency

771
00:26:07,861 --> 00:26:09,219
because I'm not willing to waiver

772
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:10,635
to make them feel good.

773
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:12,365
In the same way that Sam just asked about

774
00:26:12,365 --> 00:26:13,970
self awareness.

775
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,034
I'm not in the business to
make a client feel good,

776
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:18,432
and make them justify
programmatic banners,

777
00:26:18,432 --> 00:26:19,692
and justify print.

778
00:26:19,692 --> 00:26:21,608
I don't believe in it.

779
00:26:21,608 --> 00:26:23,159
So

780
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:23,992
you know,

781
00:26:23,992 --> 00:26:27,135
It's very easy to measure
Instagram and Facebook

782
00:26:27,135 --> 00:26:29,200
if you drive them to a conversion.

783
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,235
Make a coupon piece of content

784
00:26:31,235 --> 00:26:32,745
and drive them to stores.

785
00:26:32,745 --> 00:26:34,821
And see how that does against direct mail.

786
00:26:34,821 --> 00:26:37,326
Tell them to do that same
coupon in a print magazine.

787
00:26:37,326 --> 00:26:38,735
No, no, no that's branding,

788
00:26:38,735 --> 00:26:40,394
we have to put a pretty picture.

789
00:26:40,394 --> 00:26:42,477
It's complete horse crap.

790
00:26:43,325 --> 00:26:45,799
And it's why the big businesses of today

791
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:48,259
are on the verge of not
being around tomorrow,

792
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:49,657
because a lot of their
behavior doesn't map

793
00:26:49,657 --> 00:26:53,074
the reality of the world that we live in.

794
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:54,946
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

795
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,363
- You're welcome.

796
00:26:59,689 --> 00:27:00,641
She just looked you dead in the face

797
00:27:00,641 --> 00:27:01,690
and said I'm gonna move out.

798
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,354
That was super gangster.

799
00:27:03,354 --> 00:27:04,400
(Audience laughs)

800
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,364
You were right there,

801
00:27:05,364 --> 00:27:06,197
you raised your hand.

802
00:27:06,197 --> 00:27:07,030
She looked you right in the face

803
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,750
and said nah I'm gonna move it.

804
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,887
The was honestly the favorite
part of my whole day so far.

805
00:27:10,887 --> 00:27:11,720
(Audience laughs)

806
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,553
Hey.

807
00:27:12,553 --> 00:27:13,386
- [Audience Member] Hey Gary, I'm Romand.

808
00:27:13,386 --> 00:27:14,219
- Romand.

809
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:15,052
- [Audience Member] I'm also
from the Legacy guest talk.

810
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:15,885
- No kidding?

811
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:16,718
- [Audience Member] Yeah.

812
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,551
- What town?

813
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:18,384
- [Audience Member] Mundulof.

814
00:27:18,384 --> 00:27:19,217
- How close is that to Bulborusk?

815
00:27:19,217 --> 00:27:20,050
- [Audience Member] One hour.

816
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,462
- Awesome.
- [Audience Member] Yeah.

817
00:27:21,462 --> 00:27:23,591
So, I run a website
called Crypt the Jobless.

818
00:27:23,591 --> 00:27:24,424
- Yes.

819
00:27:24,424 --> 00:27:25,599
- [Audience Member] It's
joke for Crypto positions.

820
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,432
- Smart.

821
00:27:26,432 --> 00:27:27,723
- [Audience Member] Engineers, developers

822
00:27:27,723 --> 00:27:29,586
is big blowout.
- It makes sense.

823
00:27:29,586 --> 00:27:30,902
- [Audience Member] We are
one of the top garden websites

824
00:27:30,902 --> 00:27:32,225
out there for this space.

825
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:33,058
- Understood.

826
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:33,891
- [Audience Member]
Which is a specific niche

827
00:27:33,891 --> 00:27:35,759
about 20 percent week on week growth,

828
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:37,588
but we want to grow it faster.

829
00:27:37,588 --> 00:27:39,716
And I'm trying to figure
out what's the best channels

830
00:27:39,716 --> 00:27:41,114
and what's the best way to grow it.

831
00:27:41,114 --> 00:27:43,201
Is it just content, is it something else?

832
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:45,464
What's the fire range I should pitch?

833
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:47,625
- I think you go above the
line and below the line.

834
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:48,458
So what I would do is,

835
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,494
I would write white papers and manifestos

836
00:27:51,494 --> 00:27:53,982
and distributed them through
LinkedIn and Facebook.

837
00:27:53,982 --> 00:27:56,147
And then I would do Google Ad Words.

838
00:27:56,147 --> 00:27:58,255
I think you will do very like,

839
00:27:58,255 --> 00:28:00,479
in the early nature of Crypto

840
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,898
so many people are searching.

841
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:05,023
And I think if you find
the long tail of a couple

842
00:28:05,023 --> 00:28:06,829
of different search queries,

843
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:08,995
you know how to get involved
in the Crypto business.

844
00:28:08,995 --> 00:28:12,422
Like I think there's a lot
of long tail search queries

845
00:28:12,422 --> 00:28:15,072
that will probably be
disproportionately ROY

846
00:28:15,072 --> 00:28:16,930
positive for you in Crypto.

847
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,007
- [Audience Member]
What's the best unpaid...

848
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:19,840
- Non-paid?

849
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,980
- [Audience Member] Non-paid.

850
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,357
That's more interesting.

851
00:28:22,357 --> 00:28:23,190
- Why?

852
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,400
- [Audience Member] Money,
you can just start that way.

853
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,716
- I totally disagree,

854
00:28:25,716 --> 00:28:26,549
let's talk about it.

855
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:28,074
- [Audience Member] Sure.

856
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:31,239
- I think that's ideological.

857
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:34,147
So if you confine in
an arbitrage and paid,

858
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:36,408
that is more ROY positive for you

859
00:28:36,408 --> 00:28:37,688
than what you're paying.

860
00:28:37,688 --> 00:28:39,216
It's a hell of a lot more scalable,

861
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:40,517
and more interesting.

862
00:28:40,517 --> 00:28:44,350
I think unpaid is
philosophically interesting.

863
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:47,712
But I'm not against paid

864
00:28:47,712 --> 00:28:51,540
when it's an arbitrage that
is massively ROY positive.

865
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,626
And when there's new
spaces and Crypto is new,

866
00:28:55,626 --> 00:28:57,796
there's a lot of arbitrage in paid.

867
00:28:57,796 --> 00:28:59,182
But there's a couple
other ways you could go.

868
00:28:59,182 --> 00:29:02,769
You could start a weekly
podcast about Crypto.

869
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:04,167
I mean there's a lot of things you know,

870
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:06,743
when you go non-paid Romand,

871
00:29:06,743 --> 00:29:08,593
the biggest thing that you
have to wrap your head around

872
00:29:08,593 --> 00:29:10,871
is you're running a marathon.

873
00:29:10,871 --> 00:29:11,704
- [Audience Member] Okay.

874
00:29:11,704 --> 00:29:13,190
- So non-paid's incredible,

875
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,401
I'm a big non-paid guy.

876
00:29:15,401 --> 00:29:18,068
I'm also 15 years in the making.

877
00:29:20,102 --> 00:29:20,935
- [Audience Member] Right, I know.

878
00:29:20,935 --> 00:29:23,185
- So "faster" and "organic"

879
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:25,839
don't match.

880
00:29:27,157 --> 00:29:29,449
But content always plays,

881
00:29:29,449 --> 00:29:31,655
you're gonna have to have
a unique point of view.

882
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:33,027
And you have to understand distribution,

883
00:29:33,027 --> 00:29:34,345
but I'm in for it.

884
00:29:34,345 --> 00:29:35,294
I just wouldn't,

885
00:29:35,294 --> 00:29:37,992
especially when you're running a business,

886
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:42,066
you would absolutely speed up
the process on running paid,

887
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:44,451
because of the interest
graph of Crypto is so easy

888
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,986
both in intent and targeting.

889
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:51,878
It's just, it's vibrant to
run paid in new dynamics,

890
00:29:51,878 --> 00:29:54,191
because there's a lot more search query

891
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:56,738
going on because people
don't understand it.

892
00:29:56,738 --> 00:30:00,108
And so, I would give
that a lot of thought.

893
00:30:00,108 --> 00:30:00,941
- [Audience Member] Hi Gary.

894
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:01,824
- How are you?
- [Audience Member] I'm good.

895
00:30:01,824 --> 00:30:04,623
And how are you, it's nice to see you.

896
00:30:04,623 --> 00:30:06,773
It's good seeing you not on Youtube.

897
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:07,863
(Gary and Audience laugh)

898
00:30:07,863 --> 00:30:08,959
So the first thing I have to say

899
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:12,265
is thank you for three things.

900
00:30:12,265 --> 00:30:13,545
Number one,

901
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:14,937
for me I'm an actor,

902
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:16,415
and I'm going to be a design coach in DS

903
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,597
in a couple of months, so that's exciting.

904
00:30:18,597 --> 00:30:20,191
So the first one is ignoring and

905
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:22,390
sticking with it to the haters.

906
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,636
By doing it because building in town

907
00:30:24,636 --> 00:30:26,012
and conquering others.

908
00:30:26,012 --> 00:30:30,193
For me as a young
lecturer at 27 or 28 now,

909
00:30:30,193 --> 00:30:32,576
my kids are all like way
above and older than me

910
00:30:32,576 --> 00:30:34,076
and when I came in

911
00:30:36,328 --> 00:30:37,500
like they shoot me down.

912
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,333
- Yes.

913
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:39,166
- [Audience Member] And
the second thing is,

914
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:42,592
by providing alternative
prospective to my students.

915
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:46,454
And I'm just constantly experienced
in all that they aren't,

916
00:30:46,454 --> 00:30:48,637
unsure of what to do next when they are...

917
00:30:48,637 --> 00:30:49,749
Some of them vent their issues.

918
00:30:49,749 --> 00:30:52,103
Your content really helped me a lot.

919
00:30:52,103 --> 00:30:53,619
- Thank you.

920
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:54,685
- [Audience Member] And the last one is,

921
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:56,223
I think the biggest one for me is that

922
00:30:56,223 --> 00:30:58,526
I used to always think
that I'm an entrepreneur.

923
00:30:58,526 --> 00:30:59,359
- Yes.

924
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,942
- [Audience Member] But you
made me realize that I'm

925
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,912
not an entrepreneur but I work
with entrepreneur tendency.

926
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:04,745
- Yes.

927
00:31:04,745 --> 00:31:05,780
- [Audience Member] So I think
that's a big thing for me.

928
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,807
So that comes to my question.

929
00:31:06,807 --> 00:31:08,406
Is that,

930
00:31:08,406 --> 00:31:09,239
I have a big ambition,

931
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:12,110
I believe education has
the power to change lives.

932
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:16,035
And for me, my childhood
dream to be a lecturer

933
00:31:16,035 --> 00:31:17,784
and business owner by age 40,

934
00:31:17,784 --> 00:31:19,205
I already accomplished it.

935
00:31:19,205 --> 00:31:22,558
Right now, for me to gain what's next.

936
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:24,986
Which is just about embassy over currency.

937
00:31:24,986 --> 00:31:27,760
For me, I want to view the foundation

938
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,085
of new schools to give back to society.

939
00:31:30,085 --> 00:31:31,724
So the one question that,

940
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,128
the one thing that I have is that

941
00:31:33,128 --> 00:31:34,366
you talk about ambition and the

942
00:31:34,366 --> 00:31:35,663
willingness to hustle for it.

943
00:31:35,663 --> 00:31:36,894
I have the ambition,

944
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:40,760
but the willingness to hustle
for that ambition is lacking.

945
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,593
- Why?

946
00:31:44,755 --> 00:31:45,588
- [Audience Member]
I've asked that question

947
00:31:45,588 --> 00:31:47,568
for myself as well.

948
00:31:47,568 --> 00:31:49,651
- What's the real answer?

949
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:51,697
- [Audience Member] I'll say that it's

950
00:31:51,697 --> 00:31:52,968
my parents is upset,

951
00:31:52,968 --> 00:31:54,671
but I think that's also bull shit.

952
00:31:54,671 --> 00:31:57,446
I think the biggest thing is myself.

953
00:31:57,446 --> 00:32:00,412
One that I maybe I'm scared
of success, or failure.

954
00:32:00,412 --> 00:32:02,801
That knowing I'm comfortable
and uncomfortable.

955
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:03,634
- Yep.

956
00:32:03,634 --> 00:32:05,831
- [Audience Member] But then I'm not sure

957
00:32:05,831 --> 00:32:07,601
of whether I can do it really.

958
00:32:07,601 --> 00:32:09,798
But ever since, I feel that I can do it.

959
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:13,353
- I think the biggest
thing that you have to,

960
00:32:13,353 --> 00:32:15,823
I think both your answers are right.

961
00:32:15,823 --> 00:32:17,998
I think once you get into a place

962
00:32:17,998 --> 00:32:21,393
where you're failures are just yours,

963
00:32:21,393 --> 00:32:23,560
they get a lot less scary.

964
00:32:24,495 --> 00:32:25,790
And you answered the right thing.

965
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:28,560
Whether it's your parents or
somebody else in your life,

966
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,458
the biggest reason people don't take risks

967
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:34,267
is they worry about
other people's opinions.

968
00:32:34,267 --> 00:32:38,243
I wish you guys could feel
what I feel in my heart

969
00:32:38,243 --> 00:32:39,519
and in my soul.

970
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,196
I do not care about a single
person's point of view

971
00:32:42,196 --> 00:32:43,800
about me.

972
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,588
While equally caring
about you think about me.

973
00:32:47,588 --> 00:32:49,988
It's a very interesting contradiction.

974
00:32:49,988 --> 00:32:51,662
It's a subtlety.

975
00:32:51,662 --> 00:32:55,673
But saying both your parents and yourself,

976
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:58,145
you know, when I hear I'm scared to fail

977
00:32:58,145 --> 00:33:00,191
but I feel like I can do it.

978
00:33:00,191 --> 00:33:03,491
You're just worrying about outside forces.

979
00:33:03,491 --> 00:33:04,569
It's no different than
the way you would...

980
00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:08,056
Like I love if my professors
of 40, 50, 60 year olds

981
00:33:08,056 --> 00:33:10,595
when I was 25 were to shit on me

982
00:33:10,595 --> 00:33:13,758
because I was excited about
sticking it to them later.

983
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,163
And if I didn't, and here's a big one.

984
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:18,178
And I don't talk about this as much,

985
00:33:18,178 --> 00:33:19,178
when I fail,

986
00:33:20,026 --> 00:33:21,298
I'm excited

987
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:24,715
because that it meant I deserved to fail.

988
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:30,716
I love the game so much
even at my own expense.

989
00:33:30,716 --> 00:33:35,151
Like I can't be pumped
about the fruits of victory

990
00:33:35,151 --> 00:33:39,457
without equally respecting
the agony of the defeat.

991
00:33:39,457 --> 00:33:41,203
I'm excited when I fail.

992
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:43,187
I'm like, okay tough guy.

993
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,567
The sneaker, this sneaker.

994
00:33:44,567 --> 00:33:45,859
This is interesting to me.

995
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:47,163
Why did I do this deal?

996
00:33:47,163 --> 00:33:48,436
It was win-win.

997
00:33:48,436 --> 00:33:50,488
If it works, I get to run around

998
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:52,285
with the legacy of being
like the first Entrepreneur

999
00:33:52,285 --> 00:33:53,817
with a signature sneaker and then,

1000
00:33:53,817 --> 00:33:54,974
you know, it's kind of cool right?

1001
00:33:54,974 --> 00:33:57,297
Like if in 20 years Entrepreneurs
are just like athletes

1002
00:33:57,297 --> 00:33:59,547
and musicians that have sneakers,

1003
00:33:59,547 --> 00:34:01,460
I can sit here in 20 years and be like

1004
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,268
you know the way I thought
about the first sneaker

1005
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:04,101
you know, it's cool.

1006
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:07,042
It's a legacy play of
being strategically right.

1007
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:08,973
But if I fail,

1008
00:34:08,973 --> 00:34:12,992
it's ammo for my friends
to make fun of me.

1009
00:34:12,992 --> 00:34:15,417
"Like remember when you though
you were so cool tough guy?"

1010
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:16,380
Like it's funny.

1011
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,610
But I have to have that humility

1012
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:18,878
as much as I have that confidence

1013
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:20,687
to be able to do my thing.

1014
00:34:20,687 --> 00:34:22,395
You have to be okay with losing.

1015
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:24,085
I have a different question for you.

1016
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:25,489
Which is, if that's your...

1017
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:27,984
I agree with you that education

1018
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:29,976
has the chance to change the world

1019
00:34:29,976 --> 00:34:31,418
because it's already happened.

1020
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:32,995
Education changed the world.

1021
00:34:32,996 --> 00:34:33,829
- [Audience Member] Right.

1022
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:34,661
- My bigger question is,

1023
00:34:34,661 --> 00:34:35,598
I just want to make sure that you're

1024
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,829
not overly romantic of the format

1025
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:39,661
of the delivery of the education.

1026
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:40,494
- [Audience Member] Hmm.

1027
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,833
- So I'm fascinated by everybody right now

1028
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:45,772
in our current state, being in technology.

1029
00:34:45,773 --> 00:34:46,936
Let me explain.

1030
00:34:46,936 --> 00:34:49,043
The fact that we in society put

1031
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:52,668
a written hand written note on a pedestal,

1032
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:55,699
as this is some great gesture

1033
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:58,204
versus when we text people,

1034
00:34:58,204 --> 00:34:59,451
it's fascinating to me,

1035
00:34:59,451 --> 00:35:01,538
because we've put the medium

1036
00:35:01,538 --> 00:35:04,336
on a pedestal, not the action.

1037
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:05,856
So you're telling me if I write

1038
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:09,487
an incredible six sentence empathetic

1039
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:12,918
love letter to my mom of my admiration

1040
00:35:12,918 --> 00:35:15,197
of her in text form,

1041
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:18,057
that, that for some
reason is less powerful

1042
00:35:18,057 --> 00:35:21,122
than a written hand written
note for that same delivery

1043
00:35:21,122 --> 00:35:23,207
just because we're anti technology,

1044
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:24,523
because we fear change.

1045
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:26,218
I laugh at that.

1046
00:35:26,218 --> 00:35:28,157
That's how I think about education.

1047
00:35:28,157 --> 00:35:30,038
I do not believe in a lot of ways

1048
00:35:30,038 --> 00:35:32,116
that education is being dispersed

1049
00:35:32,116 --> 00:35:34,678
because it is in the
selfish financial interest

1050
00:35:34,678 --> 00:35:36,837
of the disperser.

1051
00:35:36,837 --> 00:35:38,587
So, one weird insight

1052
00:35:40,423 --> 00:35:42,042
could be that

1053
00:35:42,042 --> 00:35:44,452
that's your unlock.

1054
00:35:44,452 --> 00:35:45,698
That you believe in it but

1055
00:35:45,698 --> 00:35:49,865
subconsciously you know
that the format is bullshit.

1056
00:35:50,954 --> 00:35:51,787
- [Audience Member] Thank you very much.

1057
00:35:51,787 --> 00:35:53,924
- You're welcome.

1058
00:35:53,924 --> 00:35:55,576
- [Staff Member] We have one
last question to wrap up,

1059
00:35:55,576 --> 00:35:58,251
and we have a guest who flew
in all the way from Indonesia

1060
00:35:58,251 --> 00:36:01,330
for this, so we will end it with them.

1061
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,222
- [Audience Member] Thank you so much.

1062
00:36:02,222 --> 00:36:05,770
Hi Gary, I'm a content
creator from Indonesia.

1063
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,991
Thanks for flying here to
Singapore, it's moving.

1064
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:09,000
Yeah I saw you in Asia.

1065
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,833
- Thank you.

1066
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:12,666
(Audience laughs)

1067
00:36:13,508 --> 00:36:14,362
- [Audience Member] For a worker,

1068
00:36:14,362 --> 00:36:15,323
a person like you,

1069
00:36:15,323 --> 00:36:16,939
I'm really curious about

1070
00:36:16,939 --> 00:36:19,525
how do you manage you time
with you and your family?

1071
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:20,358
- Yes.

1072
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:21,691
- [Audience Member] And
in the previous session,

1073
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:23,945
you talked about escapism.

1074
00:36:23,945 --> 00:36:24,778
- [Audience Member] We as--
- Yes.

1075
00:36:24,778 --> 00:36:25,611
- [Audience Member] Human beings,

1076
00:36:25,611 --> 00:36:26,932
we appear to have escapism.

1077
00:36:26,932 --> 00:36:28,079
And my question is,

1078
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,714
what is your answer to that?

1079
00:36:30,714 --> 00:36:33,118
- My escapism is the New York Jets.

1080
00:36:33,118 --> 00:36:33,951
- [Audience Member] Okay.

1081
00:36:33,951 --> 00:36:36,429
- For those three hours, 16 Sundays a year

1082
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:37,571
in the fall and winter,

1083
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:39,504
you could tell me that

1084
00:36:39,504 --> 00:36:42,426
the world is ending and I won't care.

1085
00:36:42,426 --> 00:36:45,330
Because that escapism
is my pure quiet zone,

1086
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,629
and nothing in business,

1087
00:36:46,629 --> 00:36:49,460
technology, social unrest

1088
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,725
is in my mind.

1089
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:52,085
All I'm worried about is,

1090
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,137
my guys score more touchdowns

1091
00:36:54,137 --> 00:36:55,393
than your guys, right?

1092
00:36:55,393 --> 00:36:56,685
So that's my escapism.

1093
00:36:56,685 --> 00:36:58,080
And some people use film,

1094
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,175
like I don't watch movies,

1095
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,441
but I love movies

1096
00:37:00,441 --> 00:37:02,335
because I know that does
that for a lot of people.

1097
00:37:02,335 --> 00:37:04,304
You get wrapped up in
that story, that's cool.

1098
00:37:04,304 --> 00:37:05,865
Reading, you know.

1099
00:37:05,865 --> 00:37:08,121
I love people having
their version of escapism,

1100
00:37:08,121 --> 00:37:10,121
because it's the healthiest thing.

1101
00:37:10,121 --> 00:37:13,172
I think it's got some
nuances to meditation.

1102
00:37:13,172 --> 00:37:14,854
So that's that.

1103
00:37:14,854 --> 00:37:17,157
As it comes down to work-life balance,

1104
00:37:17,157 --> 00:37:18,688
there's a couple things
that I think about.

1105
00:37:18,688 --> 00:37:19,624
First of all,

1106
00:37:19,624 --> 00:37:21,422
I would argue to everybody

1107
00:37:21,422 --> 00:37:24,384
that the best way to become selfless

1108
00:37:24,384 --> 00:37:27,177
is to start by being selfish.

1109
00:37:27,177 --> 00:37:29,755
If you don't know who you
are and what you're about,

1110
00:37:29,755 --> 00:37:31,003
you will lose.

1111
00:37:31,003 --> 00:37:32,901
So the first thing is,

1112
00:37:32,901 --> 00:37:33,734
I do not

1113
00:37:34,608 --> 00:37:37,295
crumble to current peer pressure

1114
00:37:37,295 --> 00:37:40,266
of how I should live my work-life balance.

1115
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:43,622
I think that modern parenting advice

1116
00:37:43,622 --> 00:37:45,016
is quite flawed.

1117
00:37:45,016 --> 00:37:46,663
And has historically been flawed

1118
00:37:46,663 --> 00:37:48,448
because it changes all the time.

1119
00:37:48,448 --> 00:37:50,169
Because it's generational,

1120
00:37:50,169 --> 00:37:52,446
and it's macro political.

1121
00:37:52,446 --> 00:37:54,257
And so, number one I don't care

1122
00:37:54,257 --> 00:37:55,435
what other parents tell me.

1123
00:37:55,435 --> 00:37:56,908
If I work too much, or
don't work too much.

1124
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:58,849
I care about what my wife thinks.

1125
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:02,086
I care about how my kids are reacting.

1126
00:38:02,086 --> 00:38:03,545
And most of all my friend,

1127
00:38:03,545 --> 00:38:05,566
I don't over judge myself.

1128
00:38:05,566 --> 00:38:07,000
I know what my intent is.

1129
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,466
I want to be a great father.

1130
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:09,937
I want to be a great husband.

1131
00:38:09,937 --> 00:38:11,327
Sometimes I'm over delivering,

1132
00:38:11,327 --> 00:38:12,998
sometimes I'm under delivering.

1133
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:14,769
I'm always trying.

1134
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:18,064
This is also a specific
chapter in my life.

1135
00:38:18,064 --> 00:38:21,196
So because I squeezed it so
hard in these four years,

1136
00:38:21,196 --> 00:38:25,228
next year I get to bring
Misha and Zander to this trip

1137
00:38:25,228 --> 00:38:27,927
to Singapore, paid for by
somebody who's gonna pay me

1138
00:38:27,927 --> 00:38:29,731
200,000 dollars to give a speech,

1139
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:31,190
and fly my kids over.

1140
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,063
And I'm gonna take them to this.

1141
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:36,301
Like you know, life's about give and take.

1142
00:38:36,301 --> 00:38:37,725
There's no right or wrong.

1143
00:38:37,725 --> 00:38:40,378
There's what's your thing.

1144
00:38:40,378 --> 00:38:44,216
Are my six weeks of
vacation of deep down time

1145
00:38:44,216 --> 00:38:45,771
higher quality time

1146
00:38:45,771 --> 00:38:47,347
then somebody who makes fun of me

1147
00:38:47,347 --> 00:38:49,111
that comes home at six
o'clock every night,

1148
00:38:49,111 --> 00:38:51,803
but doesn't really spend
time with their family?

1149
00:38:51,803 --> 00:38:54,523
Like, I'm not pandering.

1150
00:38:54,523 --> 00:38:55,868
I'm living in my reality.

1151
00:38:55,868 --> 00:38:58,152
And my reality is four people.

1152
00:38:58,152 --> 00:39:00,061
And I'm always putting a pulse on it,

1153
00:39:00,061 --> 00:39:01,795
while making sure I'm not full of shit

1154
00:39:01,795 --> 00:39:03,262
and conveniently creating a narrative

1155
00:39:03,262 --> 00:39:05,351
that works for me because of my passion.

1156
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:07,838
Which I do just like anybody else.

1157
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:08,965
And I just keep trying.

1158
00:39:08,965 --> 00:39:09,967
And I just keep trying.

1159
00:39:09,967 --> 00:39:10,922
And I find angles.

1160
00:39:10,922 --> 00:39:12,557
Two years ago I had two weeks vacation.

1161
00:39:12,557 --> 00:39:13,720
Now I'm at six and seven.

1162
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,611
That's a big shift for me.

1163
00:39:14,611 --> 00:39:16,264
I almost took all of August off.

1164
00:39:16,264 --> 00:39:17,319
It's unheard of.

1165
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:19,097
You know, so I'm just adjusting.

1166
00:39:19,097 --> 00:39:20,428
I'm just adjusting but

1167
00:39:20,428 --> 00:39:22,682
never over judging myself.

1168
00:39:22,682 --> 00:39:25,892
Because I don't think
anybody's doing it better.

1169
00:39:25,892 --> 00:39:30,449
I just think people are
doing it differently.

1170
00:39:30,449 --> 00:39:32,103
That's how I handle it.

1171
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:32,936
- [Audience Member] Thank you so much.

1172
00:39:32,936 --> 00:39:34,409
- Your welcome.

1173
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:35,746
- [Staff Member] Alright,
ladies an gentlemen

1174
00:39:35,746 --> 00:39:37,651

of applause for Gary.

1175
00:39:37,651 --> 00:39:39,471

1176
00:39:39,471 --> 00:39:40,471
- Thank you.

1177
00:39:41,570 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
