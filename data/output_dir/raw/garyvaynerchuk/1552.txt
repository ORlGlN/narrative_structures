Stern is the exact same person<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

258
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,550
would absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> dominate social media</font>

259
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,440
today if he was 20 years old and you

260
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,000
know what Howard I got something to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell</font>

261
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,710
you you wouldn't have had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share the</font>

262
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,210
revenue with all those douchebags you've

263
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,210
had to for the last 25 years so honestly

264
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,770
you would have crushed it even more

265
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,870
because your skill set is<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> top</font>

266
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,820
and you're interesting and your cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

267
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,110
entry would have been zero and you would

268
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">have been able to come in and nobody</font>

269
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,620
would have told you shut your mouth but

270
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,080
at the end of the day the fact that

271
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,180
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> already made it and you've cashed</font>

272
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,190
in on your personal brand and their

273
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,520
skill set nice and the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've</font>

274
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,050
crushed it and made all this money and

275
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,240
did it and now you're standing on a

276
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,670
platform and not encouraging people and

277
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,260
putting them down and trying to suppress

278
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,270
because you just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be that ego in</font>

279
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,590
your own mind and that's how I look at

280
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,240
him a man honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you don't</font>

281

want somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up the ranks and</font>

282
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,900
do what you did to Don Imus to you is
