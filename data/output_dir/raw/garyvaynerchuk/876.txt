as major attention grabbers within

20
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,890
mobile devices the first time I've been

21
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,870

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,820
if you don't engage with a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

32
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,830
from a person in a year you need to see

33
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,930
every single thing they say and so

34
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,280
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not playing the attention</font>

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,540

things we don't purge it's quicker for

42
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,680
us to just go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the stream Twitter</font>

43
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,290
doesn't have an algorithm like Facebook

44
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,180
does for the best content<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's</font>

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,960
through on their tweet for a period time

47
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,520
six months or a year it should be

48
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,899
