1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,709
- You can't be scared of being something.

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:03,578
Being something in the beginning

3
00:00:03,578 --> 00:00:04,855
is better than not being
anything ever at all.

4
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:06,132
You know, it's hard to get the match

5
00:00:06,132 --> 00:00:07,790
and when you're just trading your time --

6
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,093
I could literally stay
in a Holiday Inn, I --

7
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:10,528
- I don't wanna fight.
- Fuck the middle.

8
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:12,585
But these fuckfaces don't listen.

9
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:15,989
The mindset that it is
your fault is the game.

10
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:17,375
And if you're capable, you'll be whatever

11
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:18,208
the fuck you want.

("Stay Calm" by @Awareness303)

13
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:28,155
Los Angeles, great day, heading first

14
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:28,988
to go see

15
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,196
the CEO of Activision.

16
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:34,931
Kind of our first meeting.

17
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:36,622
I know a lot about him through reputation.

18
00:00:36,622 --> 00:00:37,707
Bobby's great a great one

19
00:00:37,707 --> 00:00:40,338
and so excited about that conversation.

20
00:00:40,338 --> 00:00:43,210
Later going to see media mogul,

21
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,371
manager extraordinaire,
entrepreneur extraordinaire,

22
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:48,245
Scooter Braun,

23
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:49,508
and I'm looking forward to that.

24
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:50,437
I've known Scooter a long time.

25
00:00:50,437 --> 00:00:51,553
He's a diehard jazz fan, too,

26
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:52,508
and I love the whole Braun family

27
00:00:52,508 --> 00:00:53,489
and his brother Adam is the founder

28
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,414
of Pencils of Promise,

29
00:00:55,414 --> 00:00:58,932
a board that I'm extremely
passionate about.

30
00:00:58,932 --> 00:01:00,352
And then a couple other secret meetings

31
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,849
and then just a whole lot of phone calls

32
00:01:03,849 --> 00:01:05,048
and VaynerMedia stuff,

33
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:06,242
running the business

34
00:01:06,242 --> 00:01:07,742
from my cell phone

35
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:10,298
and some pods.

36
00:01:11,502 --> 00:01:13,593
I thought I was going to the office.

37
00:01:13,593 --> 00:01:14,426
(laughs)

38
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:15,293
I guess we're not.

39
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:16,242
We're going to home.

40
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,294
Looking forward to it.

41
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:18,314
Should be a good meeting.

42
00:01:18,314 --> 00:01:19,437
Will not be filming.

43
00:01:19,437 --> 00:01:20,788
What can I talk about?

44
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:21,794
Let's, while I got a few seconds here

45
00:01:21,794 --> 00:01:22,915
with you guys I'm just gonna look at some

46
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:23,798
tech headlines.

47
00:01:23,798 --> 00:01:24,631
Google, da da da,

48
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:27,089
YouTube says creators will need 4,000

49
00:01:27,089 --> 00:01:28,353
da da da da da,

50
00:01:28,353 --> 00:01:30,620
cryptocurrency, massive decline,

51
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,497
da da da da da.

52
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:34,134
Nope, nothing interesting there.

53
00:01:34,134 --> 00:01:35,087
- [Babbin] What about Vine Two?

54
00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:35,920
You've been talking about that a lot.

55
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,846
- The Vine Too thing.

56
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,041
- What's interesting about the exclusion?

57
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,168
- I think it's gonna have a pop

58
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:40,893
from a lot of the Instagram, Snapchat

59
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,250
personalities for a second

60
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,698
and then if it's a good product,

61
00:01:43,698 --> 00:01:45,097
it'll get going.

62
00:01:45,097 --> 00:01:46,418
You know, it's hard to get the match.

63
00:01:46,418 --> 00:01:47,653
So many of you struggle

64
00:01:47,653 --> 00:01:48,736
with the match.

65
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:50,826
To get the match to start the fire

66
00:01:50,826 --> 00:01:52,826
is very, very difficult.

67
00:01:53,854 --> 00:01:55,768
And Vine Two will naturally have

68
00:01:55,768 --> 00:01:56,800
that off the hype of

69
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,450
what it was and what it became.

70
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,854
And don't get it twisted,

71
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,937
Vine is the absolute seed

72
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,509
that accelerated the influencer movement

73
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:08,882
in the youth culture,

74
00:02:08,882 --> 00:02:11,230
along with, you know, it was YouTube,

75
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,551
but YouTube was not mobile-centric, right?

76
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,760
It was desktop-centric.

77
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,147
Babbin.

78
00:02:17,147 --> 00:02:18,397
And it was Vine

79
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:21,226
that was the precursor

80
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:23,571
to what we saw on Snapchat,

81
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:25,081
but more importantly,

82
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:28,357
long before Instagram
was reacting properly,

83
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,144
not copying, reacting,

84
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:31,419
enough with this copying shit.

85
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:32,252
(groans)

86
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:33,180
"We copied."

87
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,206
It's not, no, they reacted.

88
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:36,675
Long before Instagram reacted

89
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:38,094
to Snapchat's phenomenon,

90
00:02:38,094 --> 00:02:40,292
it first reacted to Vine's phenomenon

91
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:42,416
and created one-minute video.

92
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,977
Instagram was pictures,

93
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:46,213
and a lot of the Vine celebrities

94
00:02:46,213 --> 00:02:47,340
went to Instagram, where it was easier

95
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,511
to build even a bigger audience

96
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:51,260
at scale and different demos,

97
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,337
not just teenagers,

98
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:56,004
and so Vine has a very important

99
00:02:57,357 --> 00:02:59,408
kind of like quick history

100
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:02,014
in kinda the game we're playing right now

101
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:03,942
and so Vine Two will be interesting

102
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:05,359
to just see what,

103
00:03:06,404 --> 00:03:08,314
what it does, what the features are,

104
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:09,747
is it good, is it bad?

105
00:03:09,747 --> 00:03:11,511
You know, MySpace rebooted
wasn't good enough

106
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:12,770
and that was it.

107
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,296
It had four hundredths of second, I think.

108
00:03:14,296 --> 00:03:15,279
Vine has eight hundredths of second.

109
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,976
I think you'll see millions

110
00:03:17,976 --> 00:03:20,309
of personalities, people
with Instagram followers,

111
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:21,870
Snapchat followers, and
a lot of my audience

112
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,110
that has learned you
buy beachfront property.

113
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,546
So I think a lot of you will jump

114
00:03:25,546 --> 00:03:26,589
on Vine Two day one

115
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:28,907
and see if you can hit pay dirt

116
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:30,838
and virality and awareness

117
00:03:30,838 --> 00:03:33,088
and so we'll see what's up.

118
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,612
Thanks, that was very good.

121

with my wife every year,

122
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,848
where I'm not allowed to have

123
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:50,151
my cell phone, I have to put it

124
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:51,479
in the safe (laughter)

125
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,715
is when I get the most thinking,

126
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:53,548
as you can imagine,

127
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:54,957
especially by, like, six hours in,

128
00:03:54,957 --> 00:03:56,296
I'm like "I'm gonna kill somebody"

129
00:03:56,296 --> 00:03:58,110
and like, usually I'll just like sit

130
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,229
on the beach and like
draw out, like, priorities

131
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:03,475
and creating top of the funnel business

132
00:04:03,475 --> 00:04:05,807
for L.A. is number one.

133

135
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,994
into here, like even I'm accomplishing

136
00:04:10,994 --> 00:04:12,261
what I'm doing here right now.

137
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:13,779
- Less than an hour.

138

- Guys, please ping me if there's anything

139
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,173
I can answer for you, all right?

Scooter Braun, yes.

to produce a great,
super smart, clever video

151
00:04:53,852 --> 00:04:55,298
where we got out of pocket

152
00:04:55,298 --> 00:04:56,989
but we'd have to pay for it.

153
00:04:56,989 --> 00:05:00,489
You know, James, I'll give you an example.

call in the conference.

is to not project-manage

157
00:05:11,863 --> 00:05:14,613
the open job descriptions of like

158
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:19,183
interviewing internally and externally.

159
00:05:19,183 --> 00:05:20,544
What I think we need to figure out,

160
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:22,758
my biggest thing that I'd
like you to figure out

161
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:23,591
is like

162
00:05:26,164 --> 00:05:27,258
how to get those candidates down

163
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:28,846
to the final two so that I can meet them

164
00:05:28,846 --> 00:05:30,899
and have, or final three, and have

165
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:33,164
that conversation per job description.

166
00:05:33,164 --> 00:05:33,997
Considering you're kind of negotiating

167
00:05:33,997 --> 00:05:36,001
for like heavy discount or free,

168
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:37,499
I think we should be able to fill

169
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:39,566
all those positions by
the end of February.

170
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:40,549
- Yeah.

171
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:41,382
- Okay.

00:05:50,912 --> 00:05:51,745
- Dude, I can't believe I see you

178
00:05:51,745 --> 00:05:52,578
here in California.

179
00:05:52,578 --> 00:05:53,533
How are you?
- How are you?

180
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:54,366
Good to see you.

181
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:55,199

187
00:06:03,152 --> 00:06:05,041
- Oh, okay, so yeah, so I sent it

188
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,969
years ago when you're with the Jets

189
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:08,136
and Quicksilver.

190
00:06:08,136 --> 00:06:08,969
- I remember, yeah.

191
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,230
- Okay, that's so awesome, man.

192
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,063
So with my company --

193
00:06:12,063 --> 00:06:12,896
- Yes.

194
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:15,137
- I built that brand up,
selling in 65 countries,

195
00:06:15,137 --> 00:06:17,669
doing it all online,
all because of Crush It,

196
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,344
and I feel like a pussy.

197
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:20,177
- Why?

198
00:06:20,177 --> 00:06:22,960
- Because I had to go back a year ago

199
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,383
and get a regular job.

200
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,216
- So?

201
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:26,276
- Yes, it's just one of those things.

202
00:06:26,276 --> 00:06:27,748
That's why I'm down here
in this monkey suit.

203
00:06:27,748 --> 00:06:29,862
- I don't think that's right.

204
00:06:29,862 --> 00:06:30,897
I think you're thinking about it wrong.

205
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:33,248
I think you're thinking
about it too short-term.

206
00:06:33,248 --> 00:06:35,460
Like, you could start
up again in 24 months

207
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,504
and have something else

208
00:06:36,504 --> 00:06:38,273
and, like, you know what I mean?

209
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,106
- You know what I've been doing?

210
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:40,786
I've been taking care of --

211
00:06:40,786 --> 00:06:42,025
from all around the world,

212
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:43,997
so these are --

213
00:06:43,997 --> 00:06:45,211
I haven't told them that I've gone back

214
00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:46,356
to take another job, and I'm just,

215
00:06:46,356 --> 00:06:48,141
I feel like we're in a time to where,

216
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,778
if I take care of the presence online,

217
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:52,982
still looks like a million
dollar brand online.

218
00:06:52,982 --> 00:06:54,980
- Is that the right --?

219
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,690
- But yeah, man, I dove back into --

220
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,842
and it's like I was lucky.
- Dude!

221
00:06:58,842 --> 00:07:01,303
Look, you've gotta sometimes take care

222
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:03,026
of whatever the hell you
have to take care of,

223
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:03,859
whether it's --

224
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:04,781
- Kids and --
- The bills, 100%.

225
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:07,191
But honestly, it's not about that.

226
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:08,496
I think here's how you think about it:

227
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:10,411
If you think about your nine to six

228
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:13,017
as like you're just sleeping.

229
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,453
- It's basically what I'm doing.

230
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:16,054
Like I'm just sleeping through this

231
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:17,389
and in the evenings,

232
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:20,114
but I'm getting phone calls today,

233
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:22,418
so the biggest struggle
that I'm having, then,

234
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:24,464
within it is so, and it was Phil Knight

235
00:07:24,464 --> 00:07:26,402
that Shoe Dog millionaire, or Shoe Dog,

236
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:28,643
a show store, so he kept going back

237
00:07:28,643 --> 00:07:30,533
to being an accountant, and so I was like,

238
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,366
"You know what?

239
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:33,568
"I gotta do that to feed this machine."

240
00:07:33,568 --> 00:07:35,899
But what I underestimated
was the physical product.

241
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:38,416
Growing a brand just requires capital.

242
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,249
- Yeah.

243
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:41,554
- Beyond what I was
able to fund on my own.

244
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:42,637
- I get that.

245
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:45,071
- So yeah, so in any case --

246
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:47,261
- I don't, I think of
it as a minor step back,

247
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:48,473
three forward.

248
00:07:48,473 --> 00:07:49,515
I'm running late for a meeting.

249
00:07:49,515 --> 00:07:51,241
Real pleasure.
- Hey, thank you.

250
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:52,074
- Take care.

251
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:52,907
- Thank you, that was great, man.

252
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:53,740
Keep up the good work.

253
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,087
- [Gary] Thank you, brother.

254
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:57,378
You know, whether you fail,

255
00:07:57,378 --> 00:07:59,735
whether not achieving
something is your fault

256
00:07:59,735 --> 00:08:02,609
or not, having the mindset
that it is your fault

257
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:03,726
is the game.

258
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:04,771
You know, just sitting and I was writing,

259
00:08:04,771 --> 00:08:05,935
this is for a lot of people right now

260
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:09,345
with managers, you know, and agents.

261
00:08:09,345 --> 00:08:11,202
It's so easy to blame your manager

262
00:08:11,202 --> 00:08:12,323
for not getting you gigs

263
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:16,211
or making you pop, except if you realize

264
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:19,103
you're the one who chose your manager

265
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:21,224
and you can fire them.

266
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:22,591
It's so easy to say you're not winning

267
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:24,709
'cause your assistant sucks

268
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:27,767
until you realize you're the one

269
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:28,740
who empowers it.

270
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,547
I could think my YouTube thumbnails suck,

271
00:08:31,547 --> 00:08:33,162
but I also know that I'm the one

272
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:34,570
who empowers that decision

273
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,366
and, as you know, when we debated it,

274
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:39,193
I was like, "Okay, I'll
let you guys do it"

275
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:40,502
and even though I think I'm right,

276
00:08:40,503 --> 00:08:42,623
like, it's just that.

277
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:45,221
Like, if you always think
that you're in charge,

278
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:46,054
like --

279
00:08:47,724 --> 00:08:51,807
your husband's holding
you back, divorce his ass.

280
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:59,596
Or choose, you know, I
think we all make choices.

281
00:08:59,596 --> 00:09:01,207
But my big thing is,
if you made the choice,

282
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,557
shut your fucking mouth.

283
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:04,988
Like people that like, well,
you've made the choice,

284
00:09:04,988 --> 00:09:06,629
but then you also wanna just complain

285
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,129
about it all day, it's fucking loser shit.

286
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:15,119
You guys wouldn't care if I said,

287
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,303
"The thing for you to do is

288
00:09:16,303 --> 00:09:17,914
"to go dance outside."

289
00:09:17,914 --> 00:09:19,439
If you go outside, I have a funny feeling

290
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:20,624
if I told the three of you

291
00:09:20,624 --> 00:09:21,907
"Go outside right now
and dance for an hour

292
00:09:21,907 --> 00:09:24,313
"and your business will
do 48 million dollars

293
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,685
"in revenue this year"
you're gonna say yes.

294
00:09:25,685 --> 00:09:29,869
Business people care about their business,

295
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:30,940
and so what I'm telling you is

296
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,607
that I'm thrilled to

297
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:36,658
figure out what you guys care about

298
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:38,965
from your business standpoint and deliver.

299
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:41,851
What I care about is
putting 25 to 50,000 dollars

300
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:44,609
into the pocket of one or two or three

301
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:47,607
of my players who know
that they could never

302
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:49,964
get that dollar amount any other place

303
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,131
than VaynerSports, got it?

304
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,937
What's the biggest impact or best thing

305
00:09:54,937 --> 00:09:56,354
on your business?

306
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:01,090
Make sense?

307
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:04,374
Bye bye.

308
00:10:04,374 --> 00:10:05,207
- What's up, brother?

309
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:06,040
- What's up, brother?

310
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,873
- Good to see you.

311
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:07,706
- Good to see you.

312
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:08,539
- You made it out.

313
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:09,372
You made it out, this is the crew,

314
00:10:09,372 --> 00:10:10,205
we're doing some filming.

315
00:10:10,205 --> 00:10:11,038
- How you doing?

316
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:11,871
- A little behind the scenes.

317
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:12,704
- Good to see you, brother.

318
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:13,537
- You too.

319
00:10:13,537 --> 00:10:14,370
- It's been great to see you lately.

320
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,203
- You remember Nick?

321
00:10:15,203 --> 00:10:16,036
- I know Nick really well.

322
00:10:16,036 --> 00:10:16,869
- Good to see you, man.

323
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:17,702
Where's D-Rock, he's not around, huh?

324
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:18,558
- No, we don't like him as much anymore.

325
00:10:18,558 --> 00:10:19,845
Babbin's just better-looking.

326
00:10:19,845 --> 00:10:21,408
(laughter)

327
00:10:21,408 --> 00:10:22,377
You need coffee or anything, or water?

328
00:10:22,377 --> 00:10:24,344
- No, I think I, I'll
take a water, actually.

329
00:10:24,344 --> 00:10:26,056
- [Lewis] We have still for
you or you want some sparkling?

330
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:27,182
- [Gary] No, this is perfect.

331
00:10:27,182 --> 00:10:29,811
- [Lewis] Gary Vaynerchuk in the house.

332
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:30,644
- Hey, brother.

333
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:31,477
- [Lewis] Good to see you, man.

334
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:32,528
- Great to see you.

335
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:33,361
Fun to be back.

336
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:35,664
- This is the third time
you'll be on this show.

337
00:10:35,664 --> 00:10:36,650
- Second time here.

338
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,988
First time I was in my bedroom.

339
00:10:37,988 --> 00:10:40,749
I remember because, I just
remember it, I don't know.

340
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:41,831
- [Lewis] So I think I've
talked to probably --

341
00:10:41,831 --> 00:10:43,276
- I think the biggest reason I'm willing

342
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,860
to spit authentic is 'cause I don't think

343
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,819
so highly of myself,
meaning I'm not insecure.

344
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:51,833
It's just that, like, me
thinking Nick is not good

345
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,262
at something like business,
forget about photography

346
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:55,623
where, who gives a fuck?

347
00:10:55,623 --> 00:10:57,005
Like, me saying your business stinks,

348
00:10:57,005 --> 00:11:00,446
even with all my business things,

349
00:11:00,446 --> 00:11:02,689
I still think is just one
fuckin' dude's opinion.

350
00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:05,349
I understand it's a solid opinion.

351
00:11:05,349 --> 00:11:07,776
I understand that it
comes with some heritage

352
00:11:07,776 --> 00:11:10,315
and value, but it's still a --

353
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:12,492
too many great people who've won so much

354
00:11:12,492 --> 00:11:14,470
in things have told me I'm not gonna win

355
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,567
and then I have won
that I know I'm the same

356
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:18,900
and so I think one of the reasons

357
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,765
I'm willing to spit is, like, my opinion's

358
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:22,724
still my opinion and, like, you know,

359
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,570
take it with a grain of salt.

360
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,107
I think what takes
everybody to the next level

361
00:11:26,107 --> 00:11:28,190
is cutting out dumb shit.

362
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:33,151
I mean like no question
whether in your training,

363
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,257
in your business, in your friendships,

364
00:11:35,257 --> 00:11:36,486
do you understand that if every person

365
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:37,753
in the world who's listening right now

366
00:11:37,753 --> 00:11:39,615
started to weed off the friend

367
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,709
that is bringing the least value,

368
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:42,865
and I mean they're a bad influence,

369
00:11:42,865 --> 00:11:45,365
they're bad mojo, they're bad.

370
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:48,749
Like, bad, I mean, they're just negative,

371
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,069
they're a negative person
so they're dragging you

372
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:52,689
down, they're selfish,
they have bad habits

373
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:55,675
like a drug addiction or something.

374
00:11:55,675 --> 00:11:56,624
And you don't want to leave them,

375
00:11:56,624 --> 00:11:58,510
I want to make sure people
when they hear me say this,

376
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,501
like, "Aww, you fuckin'
get rid of your friends?"

377
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:02,831
No, just if you audit your circle

378
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:03,786
of who you spend time with,

379
00:12:03,786 --> 00:12:07,039
if you spent less time with something

380
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,474
that is broken and you added

381
00:12:09,474 --> 00:12:13,474
one person that was incredibly valuable,

382
00:12:13,474 --> 00:12:14,611
your life would be a lot better.

383
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:15,994
That's just real.

384
00:12:15,994 --> 00:12:17,395
Such a pleasure, man.

385
00:12:17,395 --> 00:12:18,566
- Nice to see you.

386
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:19,399
- How you doing?

387
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,232
- My uncle right there.

388
00:12:20,232 --> 00:12:21,065
- Walter.

389
00:12:21,065 --> 00:12:21,918
- Walter, such a pleasure.

390
00:12:21,918 --> 00:12:22,784
Let's go.

391
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,120
I heard about like some guy making

392
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,834
a trade and his job was on the line

393
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:28,675
and so the kid didn't get to play.

394
00:12:28,675 --> 00:12:29,508
So much.

395
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:32,382
But look at your situation.

396
00:12:32,382 --> 00:12:33,589
Like, what I'm so fascinated by,

397
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:35,833
which is like, it's just
about getting the at-bat.

398
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:36,674
- Yeah.

399
00:12:36,674 --> 00:12:38,528
- It's just about getting the at-bat

400
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:40,410
or like Jake Delhomme, who got to play

401
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,853
in the Superbowl as a quarterback.

402
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:44,351
If the World League didn't exist for that

403
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:46,647
like six years, well
then, he would've, like,

404
00:12:46,647 --> 00:12:48,343
he'd be, you know.

405
00:12:48,343 --> 00:12:50,868
- [Isaac] You see that again
with (talking indistinctly).

406
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:52,001
- What about Kurt Warner, right?

407
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:53,991
Kurt Warner was going
through grocery bags,

408
00:12:53,991 --> 00:12:55,684
he was doing groceries
a year and a half --

409
00:12:55,684 --> 00:12:59,504
- What about the receiver
in that Seahawks-Patriots

410
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:01,421
Superbowl that, had the Patriots not won,

411
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:02,615
he would've been the MVP

412
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,292
and he was working at FedEx
like six weeks earlier.

413
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:08,460
- [Isaac] That's crazy,
that's some crazy story.

414
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,504
- And that --

415
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:10,439
- [Isaac] On the other side, the corner

416
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:12,079
that made the interception
was an undrafted --

417
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,628
- Oh yeah.
- Yep.

418
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:15,143
- [Isaac] He wasn't even
supposed to be there,

419
00:13:15,143 --> 00:13:16,314
but he ended up being
there, like, the savior

420
00:13:16,314 --> 00:13:18,027
of the Superbowl.

421
00:13:18,027 --> 00:13:19,611
- The same old thing, man.

422
00:13:19,611 --> 00:13:20,604
- Jeff, nice to meet you.

423
00:13:20,604 --> 00:13:21,588
- Jeff, such a pleasure, man.

424
00:13:21,588 --> 00:13:22,591
How are things?

425
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:23,868
- These are my sad (mumbles).

426
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:25,586
- Are you ready for some savage shit?

427
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:27,778
- [Gary] I'm always ready for savage.

428
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:29,751
- About four years ago
I was touring the U.S.

429
00:13:29,751 --> 00:13:32,695
On a tour bus with Zach Company.

430
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:35,062
Did 41 states, 175 different retailers,

431
00:13:35,062 --> 00:13:37,586
learned all about like retail, etc.

432
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:38,741
- Distribution, all that?

433
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:41,729
- All that, found an artist, he wanted me

434
00:13:41,729 --> 00:13:42,886
to rep him, I never managed anybody,

435
00:13:42,886 --> 00:13:45,141
give a piece to Rob Kardashian to post

436
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:46,766
on Instagram, got 5,000 followers,

437
00:13:46,766 --> 00:13:48,783
sold a piece a week later for 1,000 bucks.

438
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:50,157
Now, Drake --

439
00:13:50,157 --> 00:13:51,205
- An artist.

440
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,212
- An artist, artist-artist.

441
00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:53,648
- Artist-artist, not a rap artist.

442
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:55,663
- No, an artist.

443
00:13:55,663 --> 00:13:58,749
Now Meghan Trainer, Snoop Dogg, Drake,

444
00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:00,414
Jordan Parsons, D'Angelo Russell,

445
00:14:00,414 --> 00:14:02,296
he was 20,000 dollar paintings,

446
00:14:02,296 --> 00:14:05,463
500,000 dollars, probably, in (mumbles).

447
00:14:05,463 --> 00:14:06,636
All the e-mails, 95% of the e-mails,

448
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:07,882
people couldn't afford the art,

449
00:14:07,882 --> 00:14:10,693
so I'm like, "Wow, huge space
in the price point art."

450
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:12,302
I was like, "I don't
want to dilute the brand,

451
00:14:12,302 --> 00:14:14,939
"but also I don't want
to limit our upsale."

452
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:16,727
So the idea, let's go 72 hours,

453
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:18,273
drop a limited-edition print.

454
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:20,162
We made 17 grand in three days.

455
00:14:20,162 --> 00:14:21,753
I was like, "Wow, huge fuckin' space

456
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:23,829
"for price point art."

457
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:24,952
Where do you get art?

458
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:26,449
You get that bullshit art at Ikea,

459
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,289
you don't really know where to get art.

460
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:29,122
- The whole space --

461
00:14:29,122 --> 00:14:30,090
- From an actual talent standpoint,

462
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,368
he's the best in the world,

463
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:32,317
it's not even fuckin' close.

464
00:14:32,317 --> 00:14:35,026
From a speed standpoint, I'm talking 5X,

465
00:14:35,026 --> 00:14:35,859
everybody else --

466
00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:36,947
- Yeah, like the way we do shit.

467
00:14:36,947 --> 00:14:37,780
- Exactly.

468
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,613
- The way I do --

469
00:14:38,613 --> 00:14:39,446
- Yes.

470
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,663
- Like, be good and make a ton of it.

471
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,332
- And from a work ethic standpoint --

472
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:45,029
- Well, that's the only, by the way,

473
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:45,873
you don't have to say that part

474
00:14:45,873 --> 00:14:48,099
because the other part
doesn't work without it.

475
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:49,826
You can't, the reason speed doesn't happen

476
00:14:49,826 --> 00:14:53,659
is only two variables,
romance and work ethic.

477
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:56,145
- Well, we have problems.

478
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,099
We have no life, our family
is on the West Coast,

479
00:14:58,099 --> 00:15:00,331
we're fuckin' out of our minds with work,

480
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:02,340
and I never see, from
an artist's standpoint,

481
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,371
like this motherfucker
pushed the pace of me,

482
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:07,244
which I've never had that
(mumbles), I love it.

483
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:08,077
- Okay.

484
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:09,603
- So we're 50-50 partners
and basically I -

485
00:15:09,603 --> 00:15:10,939
- 50-50 partners in what?

486
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:12,968
- In Ikonic, so this what we did.

487
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:15,906
So, fucking around in 2016,
I was a big Instagram account

488
00:15:15,906 --> 00:15:17,266
so I started bartering.

489
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:18,424
"You have half a million,
I have half a million,

490
00:15:18,424 --> 00:15:20,753
"I'll post you twice, you post me once."

491
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,932
Zero marketing expense.

492
00:15:22,932 --> 00:15:25,770
Black Friday last year, I made --

493
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,965
We're like, "Yo, we're gonna
make some fuckin' money

494
00:15:27,965 --> 00:15:29,048
"doing this."

495
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,259
- Selling art.

496
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:32,419
- Selling art, but I'm gonna tell you

497
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:34,385
about the actual business details because

498
00:15:34,385 --> 00:15:36,311
it's fuckin' crazy, but we
keep watching your shit,

499
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,863
which we started probably
January of last year,

500
00:15:37,863 --> 00:15:39,271
and you keep saying
Facebook, Facebook, Facebook.

501
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,996
Finally, we were like, "Fuck."

502
00:15:40,996 --> 00:15:42,977
- Fuck, if he's so good
and he keeps saying it,

503
00:15:42,977 --> 00:15:44,009
let's fuckin' see!

504
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,266
- Ready for that shit, though?

505
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:47,034
February 27th we go from
Squarespace, Shopify,

506
00:15:47,034 --> 00:15:48,303
we invest in Facebook, month --

507
00:15:48,303 --> 00:15:50,970
Month one, month one, month one!

508
00:15:52,854 --> 00:15:53,875
- I mean, I try to tell people, like --

509
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,397
- Dude, it gets better.

510
00:15:55,397 --> 00:15:56,328
- It gets so much better.

511
00:15:56,328 --> 00:15:57,200
- Of course it gets
better when you make --

512
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,115
month one, shit gets better.

513
00:15:59,115 --> 00:16:01,584
- It's getting so good
and we're just starting.

514
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:02,417
- Brother,

515
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:05,414
I mean I don't know how,

516
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:06,382
you're busy,

517
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,896
you know, look, like I don't know how

518
00:16:09,896 --> 00:16:11,335
to explain it more than the way

519
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:12,582
I'm explaining it, like, it's much,

520
00:16:12,582 --> 00:16:15,123
like I'm about to become
one of the hundred

521
00:16:15,123 --> 00:16:16,586
most famous people in this country

522
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:18,651
on this same thesis.

523
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:20,314
- Right, it's the same, exact.

524
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:21,384
- You know what's crazy?

525
00:16:21,384 --> 00:16:22,228
No one's listening, either.

526
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:23,089
We try and tell people?

527
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:23,922
No one listens.

528
00:16:23,922 --> 00:16:24,755
- I know.

529
00:16:24,755 --> 00:16:25,588
- No one listens.

530
00:16:25,588 --> 00:16:26,905
- By the way, do you know why I give away

531
00:16:26,905 --> 00:16:27,838
all my advice for free?

532
00:16:27,838 --> 00:16:31,722
I realize nobody listens. (laughs)

533
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:33,697
Like I give away such good advice,

534
00:16:33,697 --> 00:16:36,023
but these fuckfaces don't listen,

535
00:16:36,023 --> 00:16:37,259
so that means I can still get mine,

536
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:38,734
and people like you are like,

537
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:40,470
do you know how much you guys love me?

538
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,507
- Love you.

539
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:44,161
I think that we have a lot of cheat codes

540
00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:46,467
that no one knows about.

541
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:48,117
- Yeah, 'cause you're in the trenches.

542
00:16:48,117 --> 00:16:49,121
- Yeah, 'cause we're so fuckin' deep.

543
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:50,601
- The only people that have cheat codes

544
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:53,521
are the people that actually are, like,

545
00:16:53,521 --> 00:16:55,476
it's kind of like if we're
using video game terms,

546
00:16:55,476 --> 00:16:58,307
you can't know the cheat
code unless you're actually

547
00:16:58,307 --> 00:17:00,212
burning the bush and
realize the key was behind

548
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:01,205
the fuckin' bush.

549
00:17:01,205 --> 00:17:03,484
Like, I was great at
Zelda, 'cause all I did

550
00:17:03,484 --> 00:17:06,282
was, like, it was more fun to me to find

551
00:17:06,282 --> 00:17:09,229
which rock to push than
beat the fuckin' game.

552
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,650
I'm only about cheat codes.

553
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,564
Like, honestly, I will
not make the most money

554
00:17:13,564 --> 00:17:17,215
because I enjoy too much
about the cheat code.

555
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:18,313
- Yeah, I just love fuckin' --

556
00:17:18,314 --> 00:17:20,040
- Some people love to make money.

557
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,688
I don't.

558
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:23,873
I like to break shit, and
the only way you break shit

559
00:17:23,873 --> 00:17:25,535
is you're doing shit that doesn't seem

560
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:27,423
to make any sense in the short term

561
00:17:27,423 --> 00:17:30,027
until you're like "Why did this rock move?

562
00:17:30,027 --> 00:17:31,121
"Oh shit, coins!"

563
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:31,954
You know?

564
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,841
I'm waiting for my buddy
Rohan Oza to come in.

565
00:17:34,841 --> 00:17:35,699
I think he should be here any minute.

566
00:17:35,699 --> 00:17:37,372
There he is, I see him walking in.

567
00:17:37,372 --> 00:17:40,248
Came here for his 40th birthday years ago.

568
00:17:40,248 --> 00:17:41,516
We've literally been missing,

569
00:17:41,516 --> 00:17:44,190
two planes in the night.

570
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,359
I haven't seen him in years, actually,

571
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:47,010
but communicate with
him, he's crushing it.

572
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,763
Incredible brand guy,
Vitamin Water, Buy Five,

573
00:17:50,763 --> 00:17:52,769
just like unlimited, he's like a beast,

574
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:55,931
crushes it on Shark Tank
and I'm just fond of him.

575
00:17:55,931 --> 00:17:57,642
Look forward to choppin' it up with him.

576
00:17:57,642 --> 00:17:59,067
How long ago was that?

577
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:00,274
- Dude, like a hundred years ago.

578
00:18:00,274 --> 00:18:01,388
- What that your 40th?

579
00:18:01,388 --> 00:18:02,455
This is Babbin.

580
00:18:02,455 --> 00:18:03,423
- [Babbin] How's it going?

581
00:18:03,423 --> 00:18:04,256
- [Rohan] How're you doing, buddy?

582
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:05,089
Good to see you.

583
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:05,922
- [Gary] Was that your 40th?

584
00:18:05,922 --> 00:18:06,755
- [Rohan] Yeah, 40th.

585
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:08,364
- [Gary] I'm fine, and
what are you now, 46?

586
00:18:08,364 --> 00:18:09,294
Well, you haven't aged.

587
00:18:09,294 --> 00:18:11,066
- [Rohan] I try not to, man.

588
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:12,035
- You figured it out.

589
00:18:12,035 --> 00:18:14,362
- I remember the first lunch we had.

590
00:18:14,362 --> 00:18:15,195
- Me too.

591
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,977
- Down in Gramercy.

592
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:18,810
- Mm-hmm.

593
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,560
- We were both like "All
right, we're gonna do

594
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,954
"some things here and
we're gonna do some things

595
00:18:22,954 --> 00:18:24,099
"together, by the way."

596
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:25,371
- The good news is, we have time,

597
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,062
but it's really great to, like,

598
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:29,001
it just all, you know it's funny,

599
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:31,380
I said to somebody today, I'm like,

600
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:36,281
"You already know who the
39 players are gonna be."

601
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,138
(Rohan laughs)

602
00:18:37,138 --> 00:18:40,537
It's actually, so probably the reason

603
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:41,710
I've been having a lot of energy

604
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,970
to like keep reaching out to you

605
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,293
and make this happen, glad we did it,

606
00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:45,935
is I was literally walking on the beach

607
00:18:45,935 --> 00:18:49,497
and I'm like, "You know,
I actually know already

608
00:18:49,497 --> 00:18:52,910
"who's gonna win and who do I like."

609
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,317
- Because people can win, but
you don't wanna be around.

610
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:56,150
- Correct.

611
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,291
- That's very true, that's correct.

612
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,185
- Correct, and I'm like,
"I have to make a better

613
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:00,683
"commitment because we're
all the same character."

614
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:02,168
The same people that are gonna win

615
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:04,448
are the same character,
which is, literally,

616
00:19:04,448 --> 00:19:07,513
we haven't seen each
other in like four years,

617
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,513
maybe, and it feels like
I saw you yesterday.

618
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:10,835
And I feel like we've been talking.

619
00:19:10,835 --> 00:19:12,749
- Yes, I 100% agree.

620
00:19:12,749 --> 00:19:15,936
- So I, I said to myself, you know what?

621
00:19:15,936 --> 00:19:18,568
That's exactly right, I feel the same way

622
00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:20,986
about them as they do,
it's complete serendipity

623
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:23,016
if you're seeing somebody,

624
00:19:23,016 --> 00:19:26,226
but I'm gonna do a little
bit of a better job

625
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:28,224
in trying to find more time

626
00:19:28,224 --> 00:19:30,641
with people that I wanna see.

627
00:19:31,764 --> 00:19:32,597
That's it.

628
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:33,430
Simple as that.

629
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,263
- I'm gonna do that same.

630
00:19:34,263 --> 00:19:35,530
I used the word, when I
did my New Year's post,

631
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,523
get balanced.

632
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:37,568
It doesn't mean we slow down.

633
00:19:37,568 --> 00:19:40,047
It just means you maybe do

634
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:42,047
less of the small stuff.

635
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:46,188
- That's it.

636
00:19:46,188 --> 00:19:47,774
- And more of the bigger stuff, right?

637
00:19:47,774 --> 00:19:48,607
- That's right.

638
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,440
- It's just the balance.

639
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,873
- No no, that's exactly right.

640
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:52,145
- 'Cause, like, you can
pack, I mean you do pack

641
00:19:52,145 --> 00:19:53,145
your day, but, you could just --

642
00:19:53,145 --> 00:19:55,587
- I pack my day, but literally 31 kids

643
00:19:55,587 --> 00:19:57,132
are gonna leave comments
on this YouTube vlog

644
00:19:57,132 --> 00:19:59,287
about how cool they are, they're pumped

645
00:19:59,287 --> 00:20:01,117
that I introduced, they looked into you

646
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,272
and like, oh my god, you're such a boss.

647
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:04,039
And I'm gonna meet with six of them,

648
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:05,070
which is amazing.

649
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,935
- Yeah, I gotta learn
from you in this stuff.

650
00:20:06,935 --> 00:20:08,484
- But I might need to meet two of them

651
00:20:08,484 --> 00:20:12,110
and be able to do like three,
like have this meeting.

652
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,832
Literally this meeting
is happening right now.

653
00:20:14,832 --> 00:20:17,931
If it wasn't, I'd be
meeting some influencer

654
00:20:17,931 --> 00:20:20,613
on Instagram and some, you know,

655
00:20:20,613 --> 00:20:21,695
up and coming hip hop artist.

656
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:24,534
Which is great, or a
client or trying to buy Uno

657
00:20:24,534 --> 00:20:26,225
from Mattel, or whatever
the fuck I'm doing,

658
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:30,191
but there's, I'm trying
to, I've made a mental list

659
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:32,028
of like 30, 40 guys and girls,

660
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:34,665
and I'm like, "I'm gonna triple down

661
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:35,758
"on those relationships."

662
00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:36,801
- Smart.

663
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:37,861
- Because they're valuable.

664
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,099
- Scooter's one of them
as well, obviously.

665
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:40,001
- Of course.

666
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:41,184
- Smart guy, great guy.

667
00:20:41,184 --> 00:20:42,320
- Scooter's my homey, homey, homey,

668
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,702
and I don't think I've
seen him in 18 months.

669
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,523
Because again, I realize, Ashton too,

670
00:20:47,523 --> 00:20:48,956
which I didn't pull off on this trip

671
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,533
'cause he had to flight to San Francisco,

672
00:20:50,533 --> 00:20:54,174
but like, I already know
who the fuckin' people are.

673
00:20:54,174 --> 00:20:56,089
I know who they are.

674
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,777
- It's funny, like Ashton,
who's unbelievable,

675
00:20:57,777 --> 00:20:59,200
asked me, 'cause we did
dumb stuff together.

676
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,044
- Yes.

677
00:21:00,044 --> 00:21:02,223
- People don't understand
how smart that guy is.

678
00:21:02,223 --> 00:21:03,410
- I know, well, that's 'cause
he was a real celebrity

679
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,429
before he got smart.
- Right.

680
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:07,208
And by the way, the stuff
he was a celebrity on,

681
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:10,959
which was like, the '70s
show, even The Ranch,

682
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:11,792
what he's doing now --

683
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,004
- Hey Dude, Where's My Car? (laughs)

684
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:13,837
- Yeah.

685
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:17,967
- But the public perception was so goofy,

686
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:19,330
but he's so smart.

687
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,992
- When I sit down and have, like --

688
00:21:20,992 --> 00:21:21,825
- The best.

689
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:23,057
- I'm lost in tech conversations with him.

690
00:21:23,057 --> 00:21:23,890
- The best.

691
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,187
- 'Cause he's operating at
a higher level than I am.

692
00:21:25,187 --> 00:21:26,020
- The best, the best.

693
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,247
- Then you've got grocery
where, some groceries

694
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,153
try and match like an --

695
00:21:30,153 --> 00:21:31,609
- Yep, yep, yep.

696
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:32,607
- And they work off a smaller margin,

697
00:21:32,607 --> 00:21:34,006
and others realize they're working off

698
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:35,943
a high margin, so they have higher pricing

699
00:21:35,943 --> 00:21:37,976
and they do promos to try and --

700
00:21:37,976 --> 00:21:38,809
- That's right.

701
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:41,072
- Costco says "You ship direct to me,

702
00:21:41,072 --> 00:21:43,515
"it's a bulk item, you
don't sell individuals."

703
00:21:43,515 --> 00:21:45,765
Everyone's got their place.

704
00:21:46,853 --> 00:21:49,438
It's like the jungle, right?

705
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:53,773
Lions can coexist, even
though they're the strongest,

706
00:21:53,773 --> 00:21:57,151
lions can coexist with gazelle,
'cause the gazelles just --

707
00:21:57,151 --> 00:21:58,863
- I totally understand.

708
00:21:58,863 --> 00:21:59,881
- Okay.

709
00:21:59,881 --> 00:22:03,223
What happens today if
you introduced a T. Rex

710
00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:04,253
into the jungle?

711
00:22:04,253 --> 00:22:05,236
- Well, that's what happened.

712
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:07,819
- Exactly, so the T. Rex
is eating everything.

713
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:09,849
- The greatest part of that is why

714
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:11,687
the direct-to-consumer business is gonna

715
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:12,520
be so important.

716
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,830
- Yeah, but what Amazon is doing,

717
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,322
the problem is, if they had to operate

718
00:22:16,322 --> 00:22:18,768
their business on a profitable basis

719
00:22:18,768 --> 00:22:20,607
like everybody else, it'd be a fair game.

720
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:21,488
- That's fine.

721
00:22:21,488 --> 00:22:22,901
- But they're making so much money

722
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:24,815
in the left hand it doesn't matter

723
00:22:24,815 --> 00:22:25,781
what they're doing in the right hand

724
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:27,797
and then they're saying, well,

725
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:30,032
"We're gonna sell singles
or whatever it is,

726
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:31,983
"but if you're pricing
at Costco is this" --

727
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,667
- My friend, loss leaders have existed

728
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:34,500
for a long time.

729
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,365
They just have to most
macro fuckin' loss leader.

730
00:22:38,365 --> 00:22:39,985
- [Rohan] He lives in L.A.?

731
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:41,900
- I don't know, I don't know.

732
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,072
But he's like legitimately --

733
00:22:43,072 --> 00:22:44,243
- [Rohan] Do you have a place out here?

734
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:45,076
- No.

735
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:45,909
- [Rohan] Where do you stay?

736
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:46,742
- SLS.

737
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:47,625
- [Rohan] Really?

738
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:48,458
- Yeah.

739
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,576
Why, where do you want me to stay?

740
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,105
- Get a place out here.

741
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:53,015
- I thinking about, so nice to meet you.

742
00:22:53,015 --> 00:22:53,848
Thank you for the hospitality.

743
00:22:53,848 --> 00:22:56,431
I'll talk to you soon, brother.

744
00:22:57,683 --> 00:22:59,516
- [Rohan] SLS doesn't feel relaxing to me.

745
00:22:59,516 --> 00:23:01,078
- I mean I sleep, I could literally stay

746
00:23:01,078 --> 00:23:01,922
in a Holiday Inn.

747
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,369
I like walk in, go to sleep, and leave.

748
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:05,145
(laughter)

749
00:23:05,145 --> 00:23:07,228
That's literally where I'm at.

750
00:23:07,228 --> 00:23:08,061
Thanks, brother.

751
00:23:08,061 --> 00:23:08,894
I'll talk to you later.

752
00:23:08,894 --> 00:23:09,930
- [Rohan] Good seeing you.

753
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,013
- Good to see you, Rohan.

754
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:17,542
- [Babbin] How do you think our,

755
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:18,750
like you guys were talking about Ashton

756
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,235
at the beginning, how he
went from like this goofy

757
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:24,922
thing to being seen as like
a whole different monster.

758
00:23:24,922 --> 00:23:25,755
- Yep.

759
00:23:25,755 --> 00:23:27,442
- [Babbin] Do you think,
like, it's just natural

760
00:23:27,442 --> 00:23:29,396
that you'll be pigeonholed
as like one thing?

761
00:23:29,396 --> 00:23:30,453
How do you --

762
00:23:30,453 --> 00:23:32,052
- Well, at that scare, at that scale.

763
00:23:32,052 --> 00:23:34,307
- [Babbin] How do you
force the system to, like,

764
00:23:34,307 --> 00:23:35,164
see you as other stuff?

765
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,776
That's like my personal demons,

766
00:23:36,776 --> 00:23:39,662
I'm always scared of, like,
being seen as one thing

767
00:23:39,662 --> 00:23:41,414
and not being able to do other stuff.

768
00:23:41,414 --> 00:23:43,747
- If you are it, you are it.

769
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,018
If Mark Wahlberg is a movie star,

770
00:23:48,018 --> 00:23:49,631
if Dwayne Johnson is a movie star,

771
00:23:49,631 --> 00:23:51,293
then they go from being The Rock

772
00:23:51,293 --> 00:23:53,460
and from being Marky Mark.

773
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,909
If I am a entrepreneurial mogul,

774
00:23:56,909 --> 00:23:58,209
I won't be the wine guy.

775
00:23:58,209 --> 00:23:59,176
That's all that people call me.

776
00:23:59,176 --> 00:24:02,666
2009, 10, 11, 12, all I ever heard was

777
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:04,249
"Oh, the wine guy?"

778
00:24:05,501 --> 00:24:07,954
You can't be scared of being something.

779
00:24:07,954 --> 00:24:09,174
Being something in the beginning

780
00:24:09,174 --> 00:24:10,636
is better than not being
anything ever at all,

781
00:24:10,636 --> 00:00:00,000
and if you're capable, you'll
be whatever the fuck you want.
