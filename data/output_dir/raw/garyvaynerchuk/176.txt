00:00:08,815 --> 00:00:11,427
It's why all the clients you, it's why--

4
00:00:11,427 --> 00:00:14,835
With your best efforts,
with all the best math

5
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:18,453
still can't win without the
creative variable in the gray.

6
00:00:18,453 --> 00:00:20,308
So basically what you do as a practitioner

7
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:22,080
is how I think about about life.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,280
If it was that black
and white it'd be over,

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,484
everybody would do it.

10
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,023
- [Man] Yeah.
- Just not the way it is.

11
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:27,856
- Thank you, Gary.

12
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:28,748
- You got it brother.
- Thank you.

13
00:00:28,748 --> 00:00:30,935
- [Woman] We have that
11:00 discuss (mumbles)

14
00:00:30,935 --> 00:00:32,018
- Are they here, are they ready?

15
00:00:32,018 --> 00:00:32,851
Yeah, him bring him here.

16
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:33,684
- [Woman] Okay.

17
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:34,517
- Thank you.

18
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:35,870
- [Woman] So what about
the other new hires,

19
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,431
do you want me to hold off on them?

20
00:00:37,431 --> 00:00:39,346
Yeah, you guys will figure
it out, you talk to Tyler.

21
00:00:39,346 --> 00:00:40,596
- [Woman] Yeah.

22
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:44,964
- Z, if you're watching
this, talk to Tyler.

23
00:00:44,964 --> 00:00:47,166
I have no idea what the fuck
is going on when it comes to

24
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:51,186
logistics because you focus
on the shit that matters.

25
00:00:51,186 --> 00:00:53,603
And logistics, do not matter.

26
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,705
People love logistics.

27
00:00:57,705 --> 00:00:59,437
- You wanna move those new hires?

28
00:00:59,437 --> 00:01:01,415
- To today like maybe on the
back end, or maybe I don't

29
00:01:01,415 --> 00:01:04,075
know, do you want to hold
them off for 10 more minutes?

30
00:01:04,075 --> 00:01:06,082
- Well, Nicholson says he's
gonna be 10 minutes late.

31
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:09,357
- We're still not ready yet, yeah good.

32
00:01:09,357 --> 00:01:10,190
Talk to Tyler.

33
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,667
My man, it's good to see ya.
- Hey how are you?

34
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:12,803
- How you been?
- It's good to see you too.

35
00:01:12,803 --> 00:01:13,639
- Yo.

36
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:15,615
- Had to do it, might as well record it.

37
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:17,277
- I love it.

38
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,530
- Awe, so nice.

39
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,508
- Happy Birthday.

40
00:01:19,508 --> 00:01:24,390
- I love you, oh my gosh, okay
time to get your autograph.

41
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,223
- You got it.

42
00:01:25,223 --> 00:01:26,688
- It's right there.

43
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:29,472

00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,000

49
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:48,668
- Hey, Gary how are you again?

50
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:49,862
- [Man] You left these in Vancouver.

51
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:50,705
- Oh my God yes.

52
00:01:50,705 --> 00:01:51,737
- [Man] During your speaking gig.

53
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:52,570
- I love it.

54
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,720
I can't wait to rock these.

55
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,624
- Couldn't leave 'em behind

56
00:01:54,624 --> 00:01:57,688
- Me and my team, you should get Nate.

57
00:01:57,688 --> 00:01:59,394
D-Rock, let's get Nate here.

58
00:01:59,394 --> 00:02:02,469
Nate, has never beaten me in tennis.

59
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:05,906
Like sports is amazing
because you keep score.

60
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:06,739
Nate.

61
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:07,954
- [Nate] Is this the tennis situation?

62
00:02:07,954 --> 00:02:08,815
(laughing)

63
00:02:08,815 --> 00:02:12,307
- [Man] He know exactly what's up.

64
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:14,039
- [Nate] And then I
never did win that game.

65
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,057
I've, also, never beaten Gary at tennis.

66
00:02:16,057 --> 00:02:16,925
Is that what we're talking about?

67
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:18,339
- We are, Nate.

68
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:19,172
- Wanna sit down?

69
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,469
- [Gary] Yeah, just for a second,

70
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:21,302
- [Woman] We need to have
a tennis match. (laughs)

71
00:02:21,302 --> 00:02:22,990
- [Gary] Just for a second, Nate.

72
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,114
As someone who's been
beating me, multiple times,

73
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:28,999
five-two and then losing,

74
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:31,040
what do you think is happening there?

75
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,294
In your gut?

76
00:02:32,294 --> 00:02:33,720
- Like why am I not winning?

77
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,300
- More about why am I winning?

78
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,133
(laughing)

79
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:38,539
It's less about you
Nate, it's more about me.

80
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:39,458
(laughing)

81
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,208
- Gary digs in, changes strategy.

82
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:45,752
I get a little loose and
go for too many winners.

83
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:47,561
- [Gary] That's an
interesting observation.

84
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:49,193
- And then it gets to
five-three, five-four

85
00:02:49,193 --> 00:02:50,102
then I get tight,

86
00:02:50,102 --> 00:02:51,215
(Gary laughs)

87
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:52,110
it's just momentum.

88
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,604
- [Gary] It's momentum.

89
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:54,604
- And, fuck.

90
00:02:55,494 --> 00:02:56,327
- Thanks Nate.

91
00:02:56,327 --> 00:02:59,608
And for all the entrepreneurs
that are watching right now.

92
00:02:59,608 --> 00:03:00,582
Okay cool, maybe you don't have

93
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:03,512
an 800 million dollar
business but maybe you also,

94
00:03:03,512 --> 00:03:06,338
in parallel, raised two phenomenal kids.

95
00:03:06,338 --> 00:03:08,032
Look what Nate just said.

96
00:03:08,032 --> 00:03:09,643
To answer the question, and this has been

97
00:03:09,643 --> 00:03:11,822
a very awkward interview,
like a little different,

98
00:03:11,822 --> 00:03:14,843
my style, here's the answer.

99
00:03:14,843 --> 00:03:17,242
Ask it again, I want you to ask

100
00:03:17,242 --> 00:03:19,147
the question exactly the same way.

101
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:21,355
If you can remember how you
asked, or the same energy.

102
00:03:21,355 --> 00:03:22,188
- Sure.

103
00:03:22,188 --> 00:03:25,402
So in the midst of failure,
when you're feeling

104
00:03:25,402 --> 00:03:28,056
so shitty and so horrible, how do you,

105
00:03:28,056 --> 00:03:31,025
actually, gain positivity
and move forward?

106
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:31,858
- What are some of my strategies

107
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:32,691
and tactics right?
- Yeah what are some of the

108
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:34,197
strategies, yeah.

109
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:35,114
- I dig in.

110
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:39,295
Nate's answer not mine.

111
00:03:40,297 --> 00:03:42,516
- I booked a set of five tennis lessons.

112
00:03:42,516 --> 00:03:43,706
(laughing)

113
00:03:43,706 --> 00:03:44,864
- And you'll beat me if you dig them.

114
00:03:44,864 --> 00:03:48,088
- I'm tired of (mumbles).

115
00:03:48,088 --> 00:03:49,162
- Now you're doing something about it.

116
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:49,995
(mumbles)

117
00:03:49,995 --> 00:03:50,843
- Watch this.

118
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:53,215
70, come on, it's Nate, you like him.

119
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:54,048
- Seven dollars?

120
00:03:54,048 --> 00:03:55,275
- [Gary] 70.

121
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:56,108
- 85.

122
00:03:57,724 --> 00:03:58,903
- Nope.

123
00:03:58,903 --> 00:03:59,847
- No deal, I'm sorry.

124
00:03:59,847 --> 00:04:00,850
(laughter)

125
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,683
Can't do it.

126
00:04:01,683 --> 00:04:03,349
- Alright, what are we doing here?

127
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:05,932
I've historically been fascinated by,

128
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:09,752
somebody's gotta get bumped
today, it's gotta get replaced.

129
00:04:09,752 --> 00:04:12,734
Somebody else gets bumped.

130
00:04:12,734 --> 00:04:14,178
When is that gonna be great?

131
00:04:14,178 --> 00:04:15,673
Because that's super hard.

132
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,079
- What we're spending all our time on

133
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,912
is context

134
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:21,308
in your world

135
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:23,021
- [Gary] And your system,
when you're passing to her.

136
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:27,274
- And why the calendar works
in these little (mumbles)

137
00:04:27,274 --> 00:04:28,746
- We're living it right this second,

138
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:30,756
I was supposed to meet
Shelby eight minutes ago.

139
00:04:30,756 --> 00:04:34,575
I'm talking 'bout, if I'm this late--

140
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:35,500
We're gonna be there at 2:03.

141
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,570
- [Man In Front seat]
You're gonna arrive at 2:03.

142
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,903
- If I'm two hours and change late, right?

143
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:41,156
I'm two hours late.

144
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,184
These two meeting are now in trouble.

145
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:44,017
- Right.

146
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,241
- They're gonna be there,
so we're gonna take them,

147
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:48,949
but at the end of this whole
spiel, when I leave at 6:30,

148
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,680
if something didn't get fit
in here, that's when we gotta

149
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,513
reschedule it, right?

150
00:04:53,513 --> 00:04:54,346
- Right.

151
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:55,179
- Not something we're
gonna figure out tomorrow.

152
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:56,012
- [Woman] Yes!

153
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:56,845
- Do you know what I mean?

154
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:57,678
- [Woman] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

155
00:04:57,678 --> 00:04:59,428
- That's the big one.

156
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,522
YouTube, super focused.

157
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,641
Long Island city, good
day, had a fire meeting.

158
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:13,078
I mean, just like a
fire meeting that I hope

159
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:16,492
they chop up for a podcast, clips.

160
00:05:16,492 --> 00:05:19,672
I'm sure D-rock will find
some time for it in here.

161
00:05:19,672 --> 00:05:20,863
What else is going on?

162
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,131
Jets football.

163
00:05:22,131 --> 00:05:25,723
Obviously the least excited
for a season I've ever been.

164
00:05:25,723 --> 00:05:28,066
It's weird to be Thursday
before the season,

165
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:32,233
and not be completely
freakin' the fuck out.

166
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:35,860
Like, didn't see myself
rootin' for the Buffalo Bills.

167
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,075
Anyways, see you later.

168
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:37,908
What up, what up what up?

169
00:05:37,908 --> 00:05:38,741
- [Man In Glasses] Hey, what's goin' on?

170
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:40,234
- [Backpack Kid] Hi, Gary.
- [Gary] How are you, man?

171
00:05:40,234 --> 00:05:41,067
- I'm doing good, how are you?

172
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:42,143
- Such a pleasure, how are you?

173
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:43,397
My recommendation?

174
00:05:43,397 --> 00:05:45,020
Like if I was, you know, if we came into

175
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,800
this and we're gonna be all partners,

176
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,835
like I quit Vayner Media
and this is my life?

177
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:51,707
Number one move I'd do is map every single

178
00:05:51,707 --> 00:05:54,325
backpack company in the game from them

179
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:56,558
if they're number one,
cause you actually like 'em,

180
00:05:56,558 --> 00:05:59,694
and it's hot all the way
down to the one that is

181
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:03,233
wack and not hot, and look
at it in a room like this

182
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:05,538
and be like, okay,
reach out to all of them

183
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:07,614
and be like cool, yo, what's up guys?

184
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:08,915
And like, what can we do?

185
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:09,864
And they're gonna say, we'll give

186
00:06:09,864 --> 00:06:11,514
you a ton of shit, we love you!

187
00:06:11,514 --> 00:06:13,021
And you're like, what about money?

188
00:06:13,021 --> 00:06:14,496
No, what about equity?

189
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:15,329
Of course not, if we're not giving

190
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:16,442
you money, we're not giving you equity.

191
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:17,545
Cool, thank you, next.

192
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:21,286
(tongue roll) You know, JanSport,
you wanna bring that back?

193
00:06:21,286 --> 00:06:22,122
Everything's back.

194
00:06:22,122 --> 00:06:23,646
JanSport, you wanna do something?

195
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:25,075
Yeah.

196
00:06:25,075 --> 00:06:26,374
What are you gonna give us, free stuff?

197
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:27,238
Of course.

198
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:28,071
You gonna pay us?

199
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:28,904
Sure, how much do you charge?

200
00:06:28,904 --> 00:06:29,737
20,000 a boost.

201
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:30,570
Cool.

202
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,108
You wanna give us one percent
equity in the company?

203
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:33,975
No.

204
00:06:33,975 --> 00:06:36,660
Cool, number three. (tongue roll)

205
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,809
Backpack, backpack, backpack, what up?

206
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:39,642
Hey.

207
00:06:39,642 --> 00:06:40,475
You gonna give us free stuff?

208
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:41,308
Yup.

209
00:06:41,308 --> 00:06:42,141
You gonna pay us?

210
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:42,974
Yeah, how much is it?

211
00:06:42,974 --> 00:06:43,807
20,000 a boost.

212
00:06:43,807 --> 00:06:44,640
Cool.

213
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,473
You wanna give us equity?

214
00:06:45,473 --> 00:06:46,306
Yup.

215
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,139
How much?

216
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:47,974
We'll give you two percent
of the company if you sign

217
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,133
a three year deal, only
wear our shit, da, da, da.

218
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:50,966
Then you decide.

219
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:51,799
Cool, thank you.

220
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:53,460
Next. (tongue roll)

221
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,293
Hello.

222
00:06:54,293 --> 00:06:56,712
Backpack, backpack, backpack,
backpack, backpack, what's up?

223
00:06:56,712 --> 00:06:57,971
- [Backpack Kid] You
can only have one deal.

224
00:06:57,971 --> 00:07:01,847
Sure, notice how I'm calling
everybody? (laughter)

225
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:02,680
- [Backpack Kid] If I have
to wear this stuff for three

226
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,573
years, I can't wear two
peoples stuff for three years.

227
00:07:04,573 --> 00:07:05,428
- [Man] You're not.

228
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:06,855
- Ready?

229
00:07:06,855 --> 00:07:10,266
You're exactly right, let's play it out.

230
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:13,485
If I paid you 100 dollars
to wear one backpack

231
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:15,082
for the next three years, would you do it?

232
00:07:15,082 --> 00:07:16,104
- [Backpack Kid] No!

233
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:19,155
- If I paid you 20 million
dollars, would you do it?

234
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:20,173
- Yes!

235
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,360
That's the game I'm explaining.

236
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,240
What you need to do is get it from no to

237
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,351
100 percent fuckin' yes,
everything in-between,

238
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:31,407
and then figure out the right spot.

239
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:32,240
- [Man] I appreciate your time.

240
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,073
- Do your thing.

241
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:34,354
- I do appreciate it as well.

242
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:35,187
- Of course.

243
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:36,020
- [Man] Very generous of you, man.

244
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,149
- Thank you, thank you, guys.

245
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:37,982
Love you, Boyd.

246
00:07:37,982 --> 00:07:39,404
Yo

247
00:07:39,404 --> 00:07:41,571
(chatter)

248
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:50,263
- What year did you eating dirt come out?

249
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:51,096
- 2007

250
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,487
- [Man] Video blog, no?

251
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:56,713
- Or video blog.

252
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:58,274
- Podcast (mumbles)

253
00:07:58,274 --> 00:08:00,245
- Podcast was a word, as a
matter of fact, I saw a video,

254
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:01,339
we were doing some older stuff,

255
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:03,782
and I called the video show a podcast.

256
00:08:03,782 --> 00:08:04,818
Period.

257
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,312
- Right, it's crazy.

258
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:08,577
- [Gary] It really is
- Yeah, it's great.

259
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:09,614
- [Gary] Real pleasure.

260
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,447
You'll figure that out.

261
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:11,280
- I will.

262
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,513
(laughter)

263
00:08:12,513 --> 00:08:14,171
- But, we got Chuck comin'.

264
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:15,004
- How you doing, Gary?

265
00:08:15,004 --> 00:08:15,837
- What's up, my man?

266
00:08:15,837 --> 00:08:17,275
- My name is QP, CEO of Highbridge.

267
00:08:17,275 --> 00:08:18,608
- Real pleasure.

268
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,590
Real pleasure, Gary.

269
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,423
- Are we going this way?

270
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:22,256
[Man in Blue Shirt] Yeah.

271
00:08:22,256 --> 00:08:23,161
- Yeah, wanna go this way, man.

272
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:24,749
- [Shana] Hi, Gary, Shana.
- [Gary] Shana, how you doing?

273
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:25,582
- [Shana] Nice to meet you.

274
00:08:25,582 --> 00:08:26,415
- [Gary] How's things?
- [Shana] Good.

275
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:27,349
- Yeah, man, good.

276
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:28,182
- My name is Michelle.

277
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:29,080
Hey, Michelle, how are you?

278
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,944
- Nice to meet you, how are you?

279
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:31,672
- All well, good.

280
00:08:31,672 --> 00:08:32,505
Look at this.

281
00:08:32,505 --> 00:08:33,337
- [Man With Long Hair] I know, long hair.

282
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:34,170
- I'm impressed, man.

283
00:08:34,171 --> 00:08:35,847
You comin' in, you joining,
or are you chillin'?

284
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:37,219
Yeah, come on!

285
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:39,527
- [Tall Man] Coming through.

286
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:41,312
(chatter)

287
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,258
- Life is good?

288
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:46,466
- Yeah, just trying to keep
my stamina up, playing ball.

289
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:47,965
- How'd you play?

290
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:49,966
(laughter)

291
00:08:49,966 --> 00:08:53,505
I've heard every single
logic and rationale

292
00:08:53,505 --> 00:08:56,518
to why not, why yes, why this?

293
00:08:56,518 --> 00:08:59,159
I'm just gonna say one more
time, there's no reason

294
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:01,791
that I should have twice as
many followers, you know, than

295
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:06,554
the people I do, you know, I
know the system that works.

296
00:09:06,554 --> 00:09:07,984
Yeah, I got my thing, and I got,

297
00:09:07,984 --> 00:09:11,090
I know I got a little something, but--

298
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,229
You do it right, and you're sitting

299
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:17,149
right here with 15.5, you know?

300
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:18,205
I believe in that shit.

301
00:09:18,205 --> 00:09:21,043
So, if we can help in any way
to inspire that, or put you

302
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:23,884
on to a little information,
I'm thrilled to do that.

303
00:09:23,884 --> 00:09:28,188
Like, I'm not as lucky,
my thing is not as like,

304
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:30,796
there's not as much sizzle,
and is not as sexy as

305
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:32,911
what you do, but I'm trying
to make every single person

306
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:34,548
on Earth know who the hell I am.

307
00:09:34,548 --> 00:09:36,446
So, I get it.

308
00:09:36,446 --> 00:09:37,279
(laughter)

309
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,233
- That's how I feel about
music, like, I don't care

310
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:41,597
if it's not your type
of music or you don't

311
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:44,771
like the music, but you gonna
know who I am when you see me.

312
00:09:44,771 --> 00:09:47,692
You gonna know who that
is when you hear me.

313
00:09:47,692 --> 00:09:50,763
- If that's your truth, then
you guys need to get real

314
00:09:50,763 --> 00:09:54,930
serious about distribution,
and I don't mean just the song.

315
00:09:56,206 --> 00:09:57,289
Real serious.

316
00:09:58,496 --> 00:10:00,099
Cause the people that
know how to understand the

317
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,833
distribution, they're the ones who win.

318
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,411
There's a reason that communist countries,

319
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:06,640
and dictators take control of the media.

320
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,626
Alright, my man.

321
00:10:07,626 --> 00:10:09,402
I'm excited for you, do your thing.

322
00:10:09,402 --> 00:10:10,904
(Sigh) Hip-hop rules the world.

323
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:12,121
- [Tall Man] Thank you.
- Good?

324
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:12,954
- Appreciate you also.

325
00:10:12,954 --> 00:10:13,787
Good stuff, it's solid.

326
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:15,038
- Let's do it, real fast.

327
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:15,903
Yeah, let's go.

328
00:10:15,903 --> 00:10:18,178
(chatter)

329
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:20,518
- Yeah, it's that day!

330
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:22,072
- [Woman] What did, I'm not listening.

331
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:22,905
- What!

332
00:10:22,905 --> 00:10:24,473
- [Gary] This is an HR issue.
(laughter)

333
00:10:24,473 --> 00:10:25,306
- Gary, let's fix the mic, Sir.

334
00:10:25,306 --> 00:10:26,254
- You got it.
- Thank you.

335
00:10:26,254 --> 00:10:28,454
- [Gary] Boogie, hey Boog.

336
00:10:28,454 --> 00:10:29,944
They're gonna take another
photo, then come in.

337
00:10:29,944 --> 00:10:30,870
Good?

338
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,703
Cool, hey.

339
00:10:31,703 --> 00:10:32,841
(chatter)

340
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:33,674
I'm excited for you, man.

341
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,631
Really nice meeting you, man.

342
00:10:34,631 --> 00:10:35,464
- [Woman With Mac] No hat today?

343
00:10:35,464 --> 00:10:36,297
- [Gary] No hat today.

344
00:10:36,297 --> 00:10:37,655
How are you?

345
00:10:37,655 --> 00:10:38,488
- [Dave] Dave, nice to meet you.

346
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:39,465
- Such a pleasure.

347
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:44,299
(laughter)
(chatter)

348
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:45,382
- It's great.

349
00:10:47,662 --> 00:10:52,130
How the fuck, like that
has no prayer in my world

350
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,334
to get anybody to do anything?

351
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:55,684
So what are you guys thinking?

352
00:10:55,684 --> 00:10:56,517
- Whatever.

353
00:10:56,517 --> 00:10:57,350
- [Gary] I want them to do somethin'.

354
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,183
- Right.

355
00:10:58,183 --> 00:10:59,016
- And there's no prayer right now.

356
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:01,603
First of all, too much
information, there's no simplicity.

357
00:11:01,603 --> 00:11:05,156
We're not gonna get the
benefits of Facebook

358
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:08,073
by not making this Facebook native.

359
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,612
I'm not good at like moving
the pepperoni in the,

360
00:11:11,612 --> 00:11:14,413
and you gotta spray the glass,
like, I genuinely mean that,

361
00:11:14,413 --> 00:11:15,868
like I know that you guys understand

362
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:18,024
that better, this I fuckin' understand.

363
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:20,096
That's why all my shit
that has no good sound,

364
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,205
no good lighting, and no good anything

365
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:24,340
fuckin' kills, cause that shit matters.

366
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,453
- [Gary] It's a pleasure, how are things?

367
00:11:25,453 --> 00:11:26,286
- [Man In Light Gray Shirt] It's good.

368
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,119
- [Gary] Good, man.

369
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,550
You are really built like a fuckin' truck.

370
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,386
(laughter)

371
00:11:29,386 --> 00:11:30,543
That's fuckin' crazy.

372
00:11:30,543 --> 00:11:32,212
All right, 20 minutes, sorry 'bout that.

373
00:11:32,212 --> 00:11:33,723
I'll be done shortly.

374
00:11:33,723 --> 00:11:35,140
Where am I going?

375
00:11:36,056 --> 00:11:37,045
My pleasure, how are you?

376
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:37,878
- How you doing?
- [Gary] Such a pleasure.

377
00:11:37,878 --> 00:11:38,711
- Good to see you, man.

378
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:39,585
- [Gary] How are things?

379
00:11:39,585 --> 00:11:40,418
Ready to rock and roll?

380
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:41,251
- Are we already recording?

381
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:42,898
- Got to go hardcore and do some

382
00:11:42,898 --> 00:11:45,648
remarkable podcasts back to back.

383
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,790
Just had an incredible
encounter with A Boogie,

384
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,005
an artist that I think is
just outrageously talented.

385
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:55,568
If you haven't listened to his music,

386
00:11:55,568 --> 00:11:57,811
you're not paying attention.

387
00:11:57,811 --> 00:11:59,982
Netflix came further on
filming, it was just fucking

388
00:11:59,982 --> 00:12:02,287
cameras everywhere all the time now, Seth.

389
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:04,661
Fucking camera, on camera, on camera.

390
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:06,664
Fucking, there's ten
fucking cameras in here!

391
00:12:06,664 --> 00:12:07,497
- What up?

392
00:12:07,497 --> 00:12:08,570
- Dude, you crushed that podcast

393
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,743
- Thanks, brother, appreciate it.

394
00:12:09,743 --> 00:12:10,963
- Just did a great podcast!

395
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,436
- I listen to you a lot,
so it was easy to do.

396
00:12:12,436 --> 00:12:15,061
- Just did a great podcast,
guys, it was phenomenal.

397
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:16,116
I can't wait for you guys to hear it.

398
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:18,858
We actually talked about a
ton of shit that I don't talk

399
00:12:18,858 --> 00:12:21,097
about often, and that's
getting harder these days

400
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:22,835
- [Paul] Check it out!
- [Gary] so check it.

401
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:23,992
- Love how you're holding the camera now,

402
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:24,921
that's a new thing too.

403
00:12:24,921 --> 00:12:26,465
- Yeah, we're, you know, D-rock

404
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:27,530
- [Paul] Well, you've
always held your phone.

405
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,307
- D-rock's super sad, he
wants to be YouTube famous.

406
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:31,462
- [Paul] I saw the new post.

407
00:12:31,462 --> 00:12:33,767
- I'm 'bout to head out, got
a meeting with Guy Oseary,

408
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:37,035
an incredible music legend,
Beastie Boys, Madonna, just

409
00:12:37,035 --> 00:12:40,528
fucking internet, not internet,
an entrepreneurial mogul.

410
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:43,646
Gonna do that, Jeff Nicholson,
head of media, 3-4 hour

411
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:45,756
meeting with him, gonna
chop it up and gonna go

412
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:49,635
sleep tonight, but before I
get going, yesterday's uh,

413
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,183
two days ago's blog, a couple days ago's

414
00:12:51,183 --> 00:12:53,245
blog came up, let's answer a question.

415
00:12:53,245 --> 00:12:55,288
I'm gonna be getting
in a lot more of this.

416
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:57,863
Phoebe Mongo, I'm gonna
end it with yours, brother,

417
00:12:57,863 --> 00:13:00,606
wrote, please don't
bleep out the swearing.

418
00:13:00,606 --> 00:13:01,699
We didn't bleep out the swearing

419
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:04,206
in this episode, we
bleeped out the client.

420
00:13:04,206 --> 00:13:06,620
I fucking swear from the
get forever, and forever,

421
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,367
and forever, and I will
never beep my fuckin' fucks.

422
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:12,200
- [Camera Man] Problem is,

423
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,667
last episode, we beeped everything.

424
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,630
- [Gary] What?

425
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,569
- [Camera Man] All the swearing.

426
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:16,402
- [Gary] Why?

427
00:13:16,402 --> 00:13:17,235
- [Camera Man] Know what I mean?

428
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:19,062
We were just trying it for that episode.

429
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:22,062
- Cool, let's roll this whole thing.

430
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:24,152
This is a perfect way to end.

431
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:25,312
Guys, sometimes they do dumb shit

432
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:26,793
without me knowing about it.

433
00:13:26,793 --> 00:13:27,697
(laughter)

434
00:13:27,697 --> 00:13:28,563
- See you guys later.

435
00:13:28,563 --> 00:13:32,730
("Where Soul Meets Body" The Muse Maker)

436
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:39,329
Gary, you good, bro?

437
00:13:39,329 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, I'm good.
