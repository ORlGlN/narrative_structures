1
00:00:04,906 --> 00:00:07,989
(light mellow music)

2
00:00:36,823 --> 00:00:40,740
(speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,783
- What's up, vlog.

4
00:00:54,783 --> 00:00:57,985
Just trying something a
little bit different here.

5
00:00:57,985 --> 00:01:01,891
This is the setup to this
keynote I gave at Boise, Idaho.

6
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:06,038
One of the most in-depth,
best talks I think I've given.

7
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:09,006
The Q and A was just
obnoxious, off the charts,

8
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:12,002
bunch of highlights, emotion, funny

9
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:14,747
and probably the most up to date thoughts

10
00:01:14,747 --> 00:01:17,566
on a lot of my thinking
around marketing attention,

11
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:20,262
building businesses, entrepreneurship.

12
00:01:20,262 --> 00:01:21,199
Here in London.

13
00:01:21,199 --> 00:01:22,534
Great trip.

14
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:25,231
Fought off a cold, I'm proud of myself.

15
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:28,102
And on the way back to New York.

16
00:01:28,102 --> 00:01:29,131
Couple of meetings in New York

17
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:30,662
and then into the weekend.

18
00:01:30,662 --> 00:01:32,041
Jets are two and two.

19
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,952
See what happens in
Cleveland this weekend.

20
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,937
But really, really want
to start being, you know,

21
00:01:37,937 --> 00:01:39,599
in a place where I'm always testing.

22
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,311
Two channels, is that right on YouTube?

23
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:44,462
Setting up longer form
content in the main channel.

24
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:45,623
That's what I'm doing now.

25
00:01:45,623 --> 00:01:47,841
Hack, hack, hack, hack, hack.

26
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,001
Don't listen to what I'm doing.

27
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:51,668
Watch, excuse me.

28
00:01:51,668 --> 00:01:53,778
Don't listen to what I'm saying.

29
00:01:53,778 --> 00:01:56,150
Those 4 a.m. wake up calls.

30
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,111
Don't listen to what I'm
saying, watch what I'm doing.

31
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:01,444
You didn't know?

32
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,680
Thank you so much.

33
00:02:06,086 --> 00:02:06,959
You know what's interesting?

34
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,965
I was sitting there and listening.

35
00:02:08,965 --> 00:02:09,937
Hey, Dan.

36
00:02:09,937 --> 00:02:13,345
And I realized, Jesus, it's fucking crazy

37
00:02:13,345 --> 00:02:15,914
that I can literally
give this entire keynote

38
00:02:15,914 --> 00:02:17,125
in about one minute,

39
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:20,034
given the context that was just created

40
00:02:20,034 --> 00:02:22,817
and I think it's just gonna
make sense to everybody, right?

41
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:25,100
Which is everything you've just heard

42
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,042
is 100% mathematically correct.

43
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:29,580
The reason they spent a lot of money

44
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,747
on that fuckin' rad ass video
that you saw is 100% correct.

45
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:37,598
And the reality is this is the only reason

46
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:39,886
that I'm standing here, whatsoever,

47
00:02:39,886 --> 00:02:43,818
and feeling good about who's watching me,

48
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:46,432
'cause so many of you guys are
doing your thing out there,

49
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:50,512
is that I just respect the
fuck out of both of them,

50
00:02:50,512 --> 00:02:54,544
and I just genuinely believe
the rest of this room doesn't.

51
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:58,606
That either it's 51-49 or
some of you are 100% math.

52
00:02:58,606 --> 00:03:00,887
The world I now live
in, these big agencies,

53
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:03,245
they're 100% art.

54
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:07,110
They have no respect
to sales and that's it.

55
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,402
Like, I literally feel like leaving.

56
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:10,381
Thank you.

57
00:03:10,381 --> 00:03:11,818
Like that's literally, like.

58
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:12,651
(attendees laughing and applauding)

59
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,377
But it's interesting
that that's really it.

60
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:16,095
Like, honestly there's a lot of my energy

61
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,039
and I have a lot of time that I,

62
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,522
and I know a lot of you, and really,

63
00:03:19,522 --> 00:03:20,886
I'll talk for the next 20 minutes

64
00:03:20,886 --> 00:03:21,887
out of the respect that I'm sure

65
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:24,178
a lot of you don't know
who I am or context,

66
00:03:24,178 --> 00:03:27,207
but I'd much rather get
into the Q and A part

67
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,751
and just answer the detailed
shit that's on your mind

68
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,412
because the theory is simple.

69
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,154
Like it's just the same old shit.

70
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:37,469
It's math and art,

71
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:39,587
and you better deploy it where,

72
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:41,684
and then the thing that
I think I've done well,

73
00:03:41,684 --> 00:03:43,599
I guess there's the thing
that I should probably

74
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,019
actually now spend some time on

75
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:48,352
is why was I in Seattle yesterday doing?

76
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:52,699
So the amount of free days
I have in my career now

77
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:53,739
are non-existent, right?

78
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:56,153
I don't speak for free.

79
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,144
Everything's about the
businesses that I run.

80
00:03:58,144 --> 00:03:59,518
I don't like leisure,

81
00:03:59,518 --> 00:04:00,929
so there's no free days, right?

82
00:04:00,929 --> 00:04:02,838
Like everything is calculated.

83
00:04:02,838 --> 00:04:05,424
I do things for a reason.

84
00:04:05,424 --> 00:04:08,284
Why the fuck was I in Seattle yesterday

85
00:04:08,284 --> 00:04:10,949
spending a free day,
which is a rarity for me?

86
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:14,702
It was because I was talking
about what I've done,

87
00:04:14,702 --> 00:04:17,615
but mainly I was trying to extract value

88
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:21,634
from an incubator in
Seattle run by Techstars

89
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:23,467
around the voice space.

90
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:26,061
These are people that are
building businesses and apps

91
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:30,130
on top of Alexa and Google
Home and things of that nature.

92
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,379
I think the thing,

93
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:33,832
you know, actually this is pretty funny

94
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:36,365
since I'm so improved out,

95
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:38,279
I'm starting to realize, huh,

96
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,389
I've always thought that
I respected, you know,

97
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:42,460
I literally just two minutes ago said

98
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,702
I just respect the art
and the science better.

99
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:45,817
I don't think I'm really

100
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:48,607
or nor have I ever really been better

101
00:04:48,607 --> 00:04:50,391
or really that good at others

102
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:51,475
and I would actually probably argue now

103
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:52,613
that I'm thinking there's plenty of people

104
00:04:52,613 --> 00:04:54,134
that somewhat respect both.

105
00:04:54,134 --> 00:04:56,281
I think the thing that actually,

106
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:57,513
in a lot of ways has worked for me

107
00:04:57,513 --> 00:04:58,520
that I'd like to talk to you about

108
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,975
because I actually think

109
00:04:59,975 --> 00:05:03,443
if I think about how much I
respect everybody in the room,

110
00:05:03,443 --> 00:05:05,429
the thing that maybe I can
bring you the most value on

111
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:09,596
is why do I bet on things
that tend to work out well?

112
00:05:10,735 --> 00:05:12,899
It's mainly because I'm
willing to lose money

113
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:14,316
in the short term.

114
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:17,604
I think that I'm willing to
waste time and lose money

115
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:18,966
much more than most people

116
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:20,297
'cause I'm patient as fuck,

117
00:05:20,297 --> 00:05:22,542
even though my energy is frantic.

118
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:23,497
Right?

119
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:24,989
I know for a fact

120
00:05:24,989 --> 00:05:29,308
that whoever has the best
Alexa skill in this room

121
00:05:29,308 --> 00:05:31,961
is gonna make a fortune, in seven years.

122
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:33,875
I'm wasting money and time

123
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,405
trying to be that person in this room.

124
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:39,155
And so I think the other variable

125
00:05:40,152 --> 00:05:42,938
that you wanna leave
this talk from besides

126
00:05:42,938 --> 00:05:45,346
if you only believe in the creative

127
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,385
or if you only believe in the math,

128
00:05:47,385 --> 00:05:50,129
how do you squeeze those two together?

129
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:52,327
It's can you allocate

130
00:05:52,327 --> 00:05:55,152
an additional 20% of your time and money

131
00:05:55,152 --> 00:05:58,646
and mental energy to start betting on

132
00:05:58,646 --> 00:06:02,134
where we're going instead
of where we are right now?

133
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:02,967
A lot of you are winning

134
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:06,442
because we're playing in
where we are right now,

135
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:10,550
while all those fuckers
are playing in 2009.

136
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,547
The question is are you
willing to waste money

137
00:06:12,547 --> 00:06:14,582
while you're making money right now,

138
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,249
being right on 2021?

139
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:19,382
That is what has kept me consistent.

140
00:06:19,382 --> 00:06:23,405
I had an email newsletter in
1996 that had 91% open rates.

141
00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:25,271
I didn't want social media.

142
00:06:25,271 --> 00:06:26,935
Like if I was making
content back in the day,

143
00:06:26,935 --> 00:06:29,877
you would have seen me sad
as fuck about social media.

144
00:06:29,877 --> 00:06:31,166
I didn't want to learn Twitter.

145
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,530
I didn't want to learn Tumblr.

146
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,645
I didn't want to.

147
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:37,298
Like I had email and
SEM and SEO figured out.

148
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:38,290
I was good.

149
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,416
It was probably the
laziest part of my career,

150
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,281
because it just worked.

151
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:45,769
But I recognized that the
thing that got me here

152
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:48,586
is never the thing that's gonna
take me to the next place.

153
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:50,336
And I think we rest on our laurels

154
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:52,575
when we've figured shit out

155
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:54,575
and so I'm spending an
ungodly amount of time

156
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:56,033
on everything that isn't the math.

157
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:58,101
It's incredible that
we now live in a world

158
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:01,004
where the people that are
building great companies in this

159
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,744
and they do great and
they make a lot of money,

160
00:07:02,744 --> 00:07:04,338
they deserve it because they take things

161
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:07,882
that we don't have to worry
about out of the equation.

162
00:07:07,882 --> 00:07:11,329
And the fact of the matter is
math will always be that one.

163
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:14,240
The quant part of our
worlds is always the thing

164
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,141
that's gonna be scalable
and then commoditizable.

165
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:18,257
But things that aren't,

166
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:20,877
are the art, the creativity

167
00:07:20,877 --> 00:07:25,817
and most importantly, the
intuition and then the audacity

168
00:07:25,817 --> 00:07:28,522
to leave money on the table
every single day of your life

169
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:30,857
to invest in the world that you think

170
00:07:30,857 --> 00:07:32,595
is gonna be there in 24 months

171
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:35,716
and then you have to be
right, otherwise you lose.

172
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:37,537
And so to me it's very clear.

173
00:07:37,537 --> 00:07:40,240
It's a little bit of a
left-field conversation

174
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,320
and it has nothing to do with
me being there yesterday.

175
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,645
You need to get very serious about sound.

176
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:45,643
Because let me tell you something

177
00:07:45,643 --> 00:07:49,014
about why what they make us successful.

178
00:07:49,014 --> 00:07:52,129
We care about only a
couple things as people.

179
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:54,960
Money, health, religion,

180
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,956
there's not a lot of things

181
00:07:55,956 --> 00:07:58,132
we really, really give a fuck about,

182
00:07:58,132 --> 00:07:59,788
but one of the things that we care about

183
00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:03,955
and always have but now we're
at an all-time high is time.

184
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,992
Uber, became a huge
company by selling time,

185
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:10,779
not transportation.

186
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:12,932
Time is imperative.

187
00:08:12,932 --> 00:08:14,223
We don't like friction.

188
00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:16,502
We don't like friction
on our landing pages

189
00:08:16,502 --> 00:08:18,540
and we don't like friction in our lives.

190
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,116
And everybody, even when they
don't have a lot of money,

191
00:08:21,116 --> 00:08:23,526
spend a lot of money on convenience.

192
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:26,437
Convenience is king, time matters.

193
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:28,465
And I'm gonna tell you right now.

194
00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:30,491
And you'll think back to this
talk one way or the other.

195
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:31,745
You're gonna think back to this talk

196
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,934
because this was the talk that
means you get very serious

197
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:37,101
about investing into audio

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,092
or you'll think back to it

199
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:41,393
when other people are making real money,

200
00:08:41,394 --> 00:08:43,554
real opportunities, changing the world,

201
00:08:43,554 --> 00:08:45,504
whatever they wanna do with the attention

202
00:08:45,504 --> 00:08:48,192
and you'll think about you
wish you started earlier.

203
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:51,021
And I lived this whole
life with social, right?

204
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:52,604
And it's fun for me

205
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:56,257
because it's just black
and white and obvious.

206
00:08:56,257 --> 00:09:00,559
So we're gonna all be
invested and winning on time,

207
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,344
excuse me, on audio,
'cause it saves us time.

208
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:04,504
Audio saves you time.

209
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:06,046
Every single person in this room,

210
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,538
when brushing their teeth in four years,

211
00:09:08,538 --> 00:09:10,073
will be listening to some sort of voice

212
00:09:10,073 --> 00:09:11,525
telling them what they're doing that day,

213
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:13,865
what the weather is, where they're going,

214
00:09:13,865 --> 00:09:15,988
what's happening, it's just gonna be that.

215
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,112
And if you're smart,

216
00:09:17,112 --> 00:09:19,979
you can penetrate somebody's
first seven minutes

217
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:22,192
every single day of their lives

218
00:09:22,192 --> 00:09:23,397
and talk about whatever the hell

219
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,349
you want them to know about.

220
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:28,511
And so, I would give
that a ton of thought.

221
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:30,752
Obviously, between you and me,

222
00:09:30,752 --> 00:09:32,367
I'm sure a lot of you seen it.

223
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:36,674
It's not even close to too
late to start a podcast.

224
00:09:36,674 --> 00:09:38,144
Podcasts are imperatively important

225
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,193
because people, you
know, the way we roll now

226
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:42,857
is we can listen and do something else.

227
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:45,599
It's hard to watch one of my
videos and do something else.

228
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:48,100
It's super easy to listen
to what I'm talking about

229
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,600
and do something else.

230
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,366
Anything that aligns you
with the end consumer's time

231
00:09:53,366 --> 00:09:56,473
is an imperatively big advantage for you.

232
00:09:56,473 --> 00:09:59,103
And listen, there's a lot
of people that are comedians

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:02,999
and actors and actresses
and things of that nature,

234
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:05,204
you gotta figure out how you mold in,

235
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,153
into these new platforms.

236
00:10:06,153 --> 00:10:07,532
You gotta figure it out.

237
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:08,365
But it's coming.

238
00:10:08,365 --> 00:10:09,515
And so to me,

239
00:10:09,515 --> 00:10:11,018
the big things to really think about

240
00:10:11,018 --> 00:10:13,935
is pairing art and science together

241
00:10:17,038 --> 00:10:19,781
and then really recognizing
the consumer behavior,

242
00:10:19,781 --> 00:10:23,034
because we're in the
later innings of social.

243
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:24,282
Like we're in mature platforms.

244
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:29,224
Which means really good
things for Facebook stock.

245
00:10:29,224 --> 00:10:30,114
You know?

246
00:10:30,114 --> 00:10:32,395
But doesn't mean as much for a lot of us.

247
00:10:32,395 --> 00:10:34,261
I mean I'm looking at somebody
in the crowd right now

248
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:35,851
and I'm smiling the whole time

249
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:38,352
because we sat in an old
Vayner office and I was like,

250
00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:40,107
guys, this Vine thing, I'm telling you

251
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,770
and I got 'em all together, all of them

252
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,223
and I was like, I'm telling you.

253
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:46,414
Like, I remember telling them,

254
00:10:46,414 --> 00:10:48,212
you're all gonna be famous in a year

255
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:49,179
and I remember looking at them

256
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:52,295
and some maybe, it was just so obvious.

257
00:10:52,295 --> 00:10:56,376
It was obvious to me because
I saw Twitter before that

258
00:10:56,376 --> 00:10:58,661
and YouTube before that and
it just it's the same guys,

259
00:10:58,661 --> 00:11:00,244
it's the same shit.

260
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,266
It's the same shit over and over.

261
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:05,011
There's underpriced attention

262
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:06,882
and there's overpriced attention.

263
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:09,435
There's headline readers
and there's practitioners.

264
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,147
I mean, let me give me an
example of headline reading

265
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:12,477
versus practitioners.

266
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:15,088
Headline readers, Snapchat's dead.

267
00:11:15,088 --> 00:11:18,388
Practitioners, holy fuck,
Snapchat's ad product

268
00:11:18,388 --> 00:11:20,966
is so underpriced 'cause
everybody thinks it's dead?

269
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:24,359
That it's $2.80 CPM to
get in front of everybody

270
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:25,655
who's under 30 in the world

271
00:11:25,655 --> 00:11:28,309
and at least in the US world
and a couple other countries

272
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:30,073
and holy shit!

273
00:11:30,073 --> 00:11:32,075
The swipe up conversions of these people

274
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:34,916
since they live in that world
are so fuckin' incredible,

275
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,159
there's no platform on earth,

276
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,494
not YouTube and Facebook combined

277
00:11:37,494 --> 00:11:39,037
that can get somebody under 30

278
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:41,239
to watch a three-minute video continuously

279
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:44,158
even remotely close to Snapchat
and it's two fuckin' dollars

280
00:11:44,158 --> 00:11:45,825
and 80 cents of CPM.

281
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:51,402
Practitioners versus headline readers.

282
00:11:51,402 --> 00:11:54,312
And this is a pretty
fuckin' legit audience

283
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:57,401
and I know a lot of you and
I watch a lot of everything.

284
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:58,932
There's just a lot of
people who headline read.

285
00:11:58,932 --> 00:12:00,008
There's a whole lot of
people who have a whole lot

286
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:02,046
of opinions about a
whole lot of shit in here

287
00:12:02,046 --> 00:12:05,407
and they've never done that thing.

288
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:06,402
Thank you, mom.

289
00:12:06,402 --> 00:12:09,485
(attendees laughing)

290
00:12:10,992 --> 00:12:11,825
So, that's it man,

291
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:13,278
like honestly it's gonna be the same shit.

292
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:15,272
I'm gonna sit here fuckin' at 74 years old

293
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:16,727
and I'm gonna be like,

294
00:12:16,727 --> 00:12:18,718
you know, VR fuck faces.

295
00:12:18,718 --> 00:12:19,551
Like how do you,

296
00:12:19,551 --> 00:12:21,885
you know like it's just the same shit.

297
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:23,425
Like I really feel like I'm done,

298
00:12:23,425 --> 00:12:24,921
like I'd love to go into Q and A,

299
00:12:24,921 --> 00:12:26,677
I don't know where the runners are like,

300
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:28,639
you know, I'll tell you
anything you wanna know,

301
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,887
like LinkedIn, super,
super, super interesting

302
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:33,505
to me right now just because,

303
00:12:33,505 --> 00:12:36,960
they're really desperate
to become the B2B Facebook,

304
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,653
so they're seducing the algorithms

305
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:40,649
to try to vig the outcomes.

306
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:44,375
Always pay attention to who's desperate.

307
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:47,526
Always pay attention to
who's desperate, right?

308
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:49,527
That's always where the, me.

309
00:12:49,527 --> 00:12:52,645
I'm impossible, I'm expensive,
I have a book coming out.

310
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:54,263
I whore myself out.

311
00:12:54,263 --> 00:12:55,651
That's when you get me, right?

312
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:56,940
Like that's how you get me.

313
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,951
It's just not super complicated,
yeah, it's how you got me,

314
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:00,743
like it's easy.

315
00:13:00,743 --> 00:13:04,112
It's easy, Snapchat, not so much momentum?

316
00:13:04,112 --> 00:13:05,108
Pay attention.

317
00:13:05,108 --> 00:13:09,304
Always, always, always
look to the other direction

318
00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:10,965
of the conventional wisdom,

319
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:13,635
'cause that's always where
the fuckin' magic is.

320
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:17,293
Understand that if you're
the best math oriented person

321
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:19,990
in this room, that you're
vulnerable to the art.

322
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,939
If you're just a creative, bad news.

323
00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:24,066
Math matters, find somebody.

324
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:24,985
Right?

325
00:13:24,985 --> 00:13:27,110
That's what this is and it's been this

326
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,894
for the last 20 years and
it's gonna keep going.

327
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:32,016
But I will say the big white space

328
00:13:32,016 --> 00:13:34,613
for the collective is sound.

329
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,823
What is your podcast?

330
00:13:36,823 --> 00:13:38,730
What is your Alexa briefing?

331
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,529
What do you say to everybody

332
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,230
for the first 30 seconds in the world

333
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,226
and how do you use your enormous attention

334
00:13:44,226 --> 00:13:47,516
on Instagram to get a
hundred thousand people

335
00:13:47,516 --> 00:13:49,843
to download it and then it's early

336
00:13:49,843 --> 00:13:51,629
so Amazon's like, who
the fuck is this person?

337
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:52,840
And they fly you out.

338
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,379
Now you're starring in the commercial,

339
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:56,379
it's the same patterns, my friends.

340
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:57,498
It's the same patterns.

341
00:13:57,498 --> 00:14:02,151
And then ultimately overlaying
everything I'm talking about.

342
00:14:02,151 --> 00:14:05,510
Does your mouth match your ambition?

343
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,675
There's a whole lot of
billionaires in here.

344
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:09,039
Out their mouth,

345
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,185
but they go to every
fuckin' concert on earth

346
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,151
and that's cool.

347
00:14:13,151 --> 00:14:14,696
Like fuck, I make 40,000.

348
00:14:14,696 --> 00:14:16,071
It's not about the money,

349
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:20,278
it's about do your actions
match your ambitions?

350
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:22,426
So, that's the framework

351
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:23,633
and then the last thing
you gotta figure out

352
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:24,965
is what you want in your work-life balance

353
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,505
and your legacy and
how much money you want

354
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:27,880
and what you wanna do with that money.

355
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,633
And a lot of people get
caught in the rat race

356
00:14:30,633 --> 00:14:31,765
at the most basic level,

357
00:14:31,765 --> 00:14:33,971
followers and likes, which
is fuckin' ludicrous.

358
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:35,133
At the next level,

359
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:37,946
which is pretty fuckin'
ludicrous too, money.

360
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:40,150
Without realizing you
wake up and you're 47,

361
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,401
you're like fuck, I didn't, you know?

362
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:43,514
So, two frameworks.

363
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:45,219
The things I've just talked about.

364
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,426
Very easy to understand.

365
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:48,961
Second part, this last
minute, a little harder.

366
00:14:48,961 --> 00:14:51,028
You got to get real to self-awareness.

367
00:14:51,028 --> 00:14:53,178
But once you know what
the fuck you're about,

368
00:14:53,178 --> 00:14:54,842
it's ironic and intriguing

369
00:14:54,842 --> 00:14:56,584
how the shit just starts happening.

370
00:14:56,584 --> 00:14:59,413
Not because you fuckin'
thought it into reality,

371
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:01,241
it's because you know
what the fuck you're doing

372
00:15:01,241 --> 00:15:04,908
and all your actions
mapped to that reality.

373
00:15:05,816 --> 00:15:07,568
Cool, thank you.

374
00:15:07,568 --> 00:15:09,617
(attendees applauds)

375
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,195
How many mics do you have?

376
00:15:11,195 --> 00:15:12,150
Two, three.

377
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,431
Great, awesome.

378
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:14,264
Let's go.

379
00:15:14,264 --> 00:15:15,097
You guys are in control,

380
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:16,046
I don't wanna get, I don't have feelings.

381
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:17,339
JR?

382
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,298
- [Jr] What's up?

383
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:19,131
Uh, Gary Vee.
- How are you?

384
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:19,980
- [JR] Thanks for being here.

385
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,813
- Thanks, man.

386
00:15:20,813 --> 00:15:22,759
- My name is JR with
Digital Marketing Hacks

387
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:25,296
and my question is I know you say

388
00:15:25,296 --> 00:15:28,291
that it's gonna end all with
robots killing everybody.

389
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,214
- [Gary] I hope so.

390
00:15:29,214 --> 00:15:30,631
- But until then.

391
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:33,044
- [Gary] Yes?

392
00:15:33,044 --> 00:15:34,291
- What role do you think AI.

393
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,124
- Huge.
- Artificial intelligence

394
00:15:35,124 --> 00:15:36,580
and robots have?

395
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,413
- [Gary] Huge, huge.

396
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:38,575
- I mean, are going to
have in the next five years

397
00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:40,897
in the marketing and
digital marketing space?

398
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:42,143
- Huge, even in the 15 minutes

399
00:15:42,143 --> 00:15:43,393
that I've gotten a better taste

400
00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:44,928
of what these characters are up to.

401
00:15:44,928 --> 00:15:45,844
They're gonna love it.

402
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,091
Like the math people are gonna love it

403
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:49,505
because machine learning
and AI just do shit

404
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:51,539
that we shouldn't be doing.

405
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:53,082
Like it's just efficiency.

406
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:55,248
It's gonna have an enormous thing.

407
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:58,065
But the good news is there's
so much that we still can do

408
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:02,250
and so basically how I
think about ML and AI

409
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,670
back at the pad is get me to
fuckin' third and a half base

410
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,408
and I'll take care of the rest

411
00:16:08,408 --> 00:16:11,012
and whatever AI can do for that, cool.

412
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:14,051
And whatever low priced
employees that can do, cool.

413
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:15,967
But like everybody is
spending way too much money

414
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:17,461
to get to third and a half base

415
00:16:17,461 --> 00:16:20,117
and then the magic is the last part.

416
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:22,325
So that's what AI is gonna
mean for everybody here.

417
00:16:22,325 --> 00:16:24,973
There's a lot of dumb shit
that people have assistants for

418
00:16:24,973 --> 00:16:28,994
or managers for that's
nonsense, zero value.

419
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:30,572
That the biggest AI companies in the world

420
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,155
are gonna get their nut off on.

421
00:16:36,673 --> 00:16:37,506
Yeah, hey.

422
00:16:37,506 --> 00:16:39,165
- [Man] Hey, Gary.

423
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,076
Hey, it's uh, it's really

424
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:41,034
exciting to be here.

425
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:41,867
- Thank you.
- In this room with you

426
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,552
and everyone here, this is awesome.

427
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:44,385
- [Gary] Appreciate it.

428
00:16:44,385 --> 00:16:46,412
- Yeah, I'm really,

429
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:49,114
experiences that help people
save time are awesome.

430
00:16:49,114 --> 00:16:50,705
And I'm really interested in experiences

431
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:54,923
that are time-bending and
how people just lose time.

432
00:16:54,923 --> 00:16:56,223
And I'm interested in creating the most--

433
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,625
- [Gary] Like hardcore drugs or?

434
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,040
- No, no, no, so here we go.

435
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,448
The world's most
connective music festival.

436
00:17:01,448 --> 00:17:02,281
- [Gary] Okay.

437
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:03,986
- Alright, where festival goers

438
00:17:03,986 --> 00:17:05,857
are connecting with each
other like never before.

439
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:07,002
- Yep.
- And with the artists

440
00:17:07,002 --> 00:17:08,125
and the artists with their fans.

441
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:09,084
- [Gary] Okay.

442
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:10,377
- And so in 2021.

443
00:17:10,377 --> 00:17:11,574
- [Gary] Are we are talking VR now?

444
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:13,242
- I'm talking about.

445
00:17:14,489 --> 00:17:15,528
- [Gary] Mixed reality?

446
00:17:15,528 --> 00:17:16,569
- [Man] So, 2021.

447
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,402
- Go ahead.

448
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:20,261
- Music festivals, connection,

449
00:17:20,261 --> 00:17:21,884
the best time of people's lives.

450
00:17:21,884 --> 00:17:24,505
What do you see happening in
the context of music festivals

451
00:17:24,505 --> 00:17:25,672
that you're excited about

452
00:17:25,672 --> 00:17:27,633
and that you're excited about creating?

453
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:31,519
- So, if I dissect that,
right, couple things.

454
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:33,428
One thing I'm super fascinated by that.

455
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:34,549
I would have never seen.

456
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:36,624
By the way, I never spend
any time predicting.

457
00:17:36,624 --> 00:17:40,828
Like voice, I'm not predicting
shit, it's happening, right?

458
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:42,988
What I think I'm good at
is like recognizing winners

459
00:17:42,988 --> 00:17:46,564
when it's practical and then
going pot committed, right?

460
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:47,558
Which means you'll lose
money for a couple years

461
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:48,391
and then get it.

462
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:51,042
You don't lose for seven
years and never get there.

463
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:52,788
The thing that's been
super fascinating to me

464
00:17:52,788 --> 00:17:54,239
that I would never thought which is fuck,

465
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,740
social media is making people
do more shit in real life.

466
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,688
Like literally some
dude is hiking right now

467
00:17:59,688 --> 00:18:01,649
just for the fuckin' Instagram photo.

468
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:04,226
(attendees laughing)

469
00:18:04,226 --> 00:18:05,185
Right?

470
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:09,218
So, what's been amazing
about music festivals

471
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:10,511
is because everybody here now

472
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:13,338
is not only themselves
but they're the PR agent

473
00:18:13,338 --> 00:18:15,738
of themselves for what
they're putting out.

474
00:18:15,738 --> 00:18:18,309
People are going to
more concerts than ever

475
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:20,682
because of that whole dynamic.

476
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,622
I think what you're alluding to

477
00:18:22,622 --> 00:18:25,532
is kind of like what's
gonna happen in society?

478
00:18:25,532 --> 00:18:28,180
Like in general, like mixed
reality, things of that nature.

479
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,499
It's, you know, it's gonna be funny.

480
00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:32,987
Technology's making music, you know,

481
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:37,290
going to music grow and then
it's gonna take it away.

482
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,739
But I don't think it's as soon as 2021,

483
00:18:39,739 --> 00:18:41,398
but I think that right now,

484
00:18:41,398 --> 00:18:44,240
a lot of music festivals are failing

485
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,067
because they all have
the same bullshit acts

486
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:48,435
and it's just supply and demand.

487
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:50,589
And so when you were first
four or five six years ago,

488
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:53,373
you win and now there's 87 micro festivals

489
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:55,542
and big companies sign
the same 13 artists,

490
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:56,375
and they're shit, right?

491
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,043
So I think there's a huge white space

492
00:18:58,043 --> 00:19:00,085
for the next generation of that.

493
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:03,036
Like the people that the
streets fuck with, right?

494
00:19:03,036 --> 00:19:06,396
And then I think that ultimately,

495
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,183
it's gonna be really
interesting just in general

496
00:19:08,183 --> 00:19:10,218
what happens when we live
in a mixed reality world.

497
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:11,337
I think the big arbitrage,

498
00:19:11,337 --> 00:19:15,485
the only thing that's gonna
break the internet is VR

499
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:17,433
but VRs quite a ways away.

500
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:19,722
Like nobody here spends an hour on VR

501
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:22,551
in a month in real life.

502
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:25,132
So we're a long, like it takes time.

503
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:26,877
Behavior takes time,

504
00:19:26,877 --> 00:19:28,449
but eventually, when we're switching

505
00:19:28,449 --> 00:19:29,986
between completely virtual

506
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:31,515
like I don't even see you guys right now,

507
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:34,827
my contact lenses have me in Afghanistan.

508
00:19:34,827 --> 00:19:36,628
Switch it off, I'm right here.

509
00:19:36,628 --> 00:19:38,414
Switch it off, and its AR

510
00:19:38,414 --> 00:19:42,158
and Santa Claus is sitting
right there, you know Santa.

511
00:19:42,158 --> 00:19:45,851
You know, that world I
think is super interesting

512
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,173
and it's gonna change all our businesses.

513
00:19:48,173 --> 00:19:49,090
Thanks man.

514
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:51,796
Cool, yep, hey Shawn.

515
00:19:51,796 --> 00:19:55,348
- [Shawn] Hi, Gary, you
just came back from August

516
00:19:55,348 --> 00:19:57,631
and you said I'm bringing you to fire,

517
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:58,635
new shows are coming out.

518
00:19:58,635 --> 00:19:59,468
- Yep.

519
00:19:59,468 --> 00:20:01,216
- And you took the #AskGaryVee
show to Facebook only.

520
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:02,173
- [Gary] I did.

521
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:04,038
- So what are your
latest strategies and why

522
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:06,528
for both YouTube and Facebook?

523
00:20:06,528 --> 00:20:08,772
- I think you have to make
content that is native

524
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:10,349
to the platform you put it out on.

525
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:11,637
I've always thought about that.

526
00:20:11,637 --> 00:20:14,127
I fuckin' wrote a book called
Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook

527
00:20:14,127 --> 00:20:15,581
five years ago on this.

528
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,449
I wasn't doing that.

529
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:20,824
So now, that #AskGaryVee
show is on Facebook Watch

530
00:20:20,824 --> 00:20:24,029
and the DailyVee is on YouTube,

531
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:27,148
when DRock is, wherever the fuck, DRock?

532
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:30,756
Hey, you know, now I could
say what's up, YouTube?

533
00:20:30,756 --> 00:20:31,894
Whereas I couldn't do that before

534
00:20:31,894 --> 00:20:35,165
and those little nuances fuckin' matter.

535
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:38,333
And all the action is
in those little edges

536
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:42,455
and so I broke them up mainly
because of Facebook video.

537
00:20:42,455 --> 00:20:44,580
Now that there's Watch, I'm fascinated.

538
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,069
Any of you watch a show
yet on Facebook Watch?

539
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:47,902
Just raise your hands.

540
00:20:47,902 --> 00:20:48,735
Just curious.

541
00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:49,865
Higher.

542
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:51,857
Right, so this intrigues me.

543
00:20:51,857 --> 00:20:54,232
Like everybody here has to watch one.

544
00:20:54,232 --> 00:20:56,355
Not because like I don't watch shit.

545
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,335
I mean I watched one, the
LaVar, the Ball family

546
00:20:59,335 --> 00:21:01,743
because I just want to see
the fuck they're doing.

547
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:03,735
Like, to me this is the
most interesting thing

548
00:21:03,735 --> 00:21:06,490
that I'm doing that the good market isn't.

549
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,990
You've gotta taste everything.

550
00:21:10,251 --> 00:21:11,917
Like if you wanna win and fuck,

551
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:14,485
there's no way you're
in fuckin' Boise, Idaho

552
00:21:14,485 --> 00:21:15,940
if you don't wanna win right now.

553
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,571
(attendees laugh)

554
00:21:18,571 --> 00:21:19,990
No, I mean that.

555
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,600
Like when I think about who's here,

556
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,374
I'm like fuck, these people are hungry.

557
00:21:25,374 --> 00:21:29,246
So like to me, 19 hands
which means maybe 31

558
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,519
'cause people get shy to two
weeks into Facebook Watch

559
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:33,697
that haven't watched.

560
00:21:33,697 --> 00:21:34,530
That's it.

561
00:21:35,526 --> 00:21:37,193
That's where I play.

562
00:21:38,091 --> 00:21:39,958
That's my margin.

563
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,126
So that's why I did it,

564
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:42,947
because I wanted to make them native.

565
00:21:42,947 --> 00:21:44,276
I have two active shows.

566
00:21:44,276 --> 00:21:46,329
I needed to do something on Facebook.

567
00:21:46,329 --> 00:21:49,483
And because I watched, actually,
fuck it, I'll tell you.

568
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:54,322
It's not fully announced yet,
but I'll see how this goes.

569
00:21:54,322 --> 00:21:57,310
Because I watched Watch
and I watched it for,

570
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,279
you know, kind of like
four days in a row, looked,

571
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,900
I understood what the
fuck they were doing.

572
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,688
So I sent them an email,

573
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:07,223
I pitched them a show and
they bought it, right?

574
00:22:07,223 --> 00:22:10,222
So now I'll have kind of anybody

575
00:22:10,222 --> 00:22:12,178
can put a show on Facebook, right?

576
00:22:12,178 --> 00:22:13,882
Like a page, a Watch page,

577
00:22:13,882 --> 00:22:15,963
which everybody should be doing here.

578
00:22:15,963 --> 00:22:18,625
I'll have my YouTube show

579
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,878
and now I'm gonna have a
produced by Facebook show

580
00:22:20,878 --> 00:22:23,788
that's gonna be a big thing even more.

581
00:22:23,788 --> 00:22:27,146
Listen, man, I talk and
like doin' and hustlin'

582
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:27,979
and all this.

583
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:32,133
I do so much more than I
talk which is fuckin' crazy

584
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:35,010
'cause my mouth is always
running but I'm just doing.

585
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,714
I'm doing, doing, doing 'cause
I'm tasting, I'm tasting.

586
00:22:37,714 --> 00:22:39,329
I never think I'm fancy.

587
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:41,115
So many people in here, I know you.

588
00:22:41,115 --> 00:22:44,397
Like so many people here make
it a little bit and get fancy.

589
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:47,812
Stop, stop doing the
shit that got them there.

590
00:22:47,812 --> 00:22:51,389
That's the minute you're fuckin' dead.

591
00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:52,306
You got it.

592
00:22:53,543 --> 00:22:55,540
(attendees applauding)

593
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,373
Hey, Marshall.

594
00:22:56,373 --> 00:22:57,206
- I have a question.

595
00:22:57,206 --> 00:22:58,039
- [Gary] Yeah.

596
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:58,872
- There's a guy I follow online,

597
00:22:58,872 --> 00:23:00,391
you might have heard of him,
his name is Gary Vaynerchuk.

598
00:23:00,391 --> 00:23:01,355
- [Gary] Yes.

599
00:23:01,355 --> 00:23:02,188
- And he told me to push all in

600
00:23:02,188 --> 00:23:03,757
on whatever it is that you're good at.

601
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,762
So I'm making this big
push as Marshall Live.

602
00:23:05,762 --> 00:23:07,292
I'm going to everything live,

603
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:09,306
like straight to ask me questions.

604
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,468
I love that aspect of your brand.

605
00:23:11,468 --> 00:23:14,011
So the question is if
everything is moving to voice,

606
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:16,506
is live-streaming podcasts going to be,

607
00:23:16,506 --> 00:23:18,958
end up being bigger than say iTunes are,

608
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,566
a recording that you can come back to?

609
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,441
- So, first of all,

610
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:24,055
you said something
interesting that we all do.

611
00:23:24,055 --> 00:23:27,087
If everything is moving
to voice, nothing moves,

612
00:23:27,087 --> 00:23:28,463
nothing is everything.

613
00:23:28,463 --> 00:23:30,461
Like we will always have the written word.

614
00:23:30,461 --> 00:23:31,538
You could have them.

615
00:23:31,538 --> 00:23:33,072
Do you know much virality there is

616
00:23:33,072 --> 00:23:37,198
through long form written
Facebook and Instagram posts?

617
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:39,731
Like if you sit in here and you can write,

618
00:23:39,731 --> 00:23:43,255
write long ass posts on
Facebook and Instagram

619
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,205
and watch what the fuck happens.

620
00:23:45,205 --> 00:23:46,038
We are humans.

621
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:47,781
We've been around a
long fuckin' time, bro.

622
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:51,948
Marshall, written word, audio,
video, shit is locked in.

623
00:23:54,275 --> 00:23:55,230
Got it?

624
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,506
So it's not like you're gonna lose it.

625
00:23:57,506 --> 00:24:00,372
Like fuck, if you're
great at smoke signals,

626
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,503
get the fuck up there, you know?

627
00:24:01,503 --> 00:24:05,940
Like, you know, like
communication doesn't change.

628
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,540
The pillars of communication are set.

629
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,612
Where we communicate changes, right?

630
00:24:12,612 --> 00:24:16,058
And then you have to be contextual, right?

631
00:24:16,058 --> 00:24:18,662
Some people are incredible
at making a six-second video,

632
00:24:18,662 --> 00:24:20,031
I keep looking at him
'cause it's fun to see him,

633
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:20,868
I haven't seen him in awhile.

634
00:24:20,868 --> 00:24:21,701
Others aren't.

635
00:24:21,701 --> 00:24:25,834
Like I can't put two fuckin'
sentences together in my life.

636
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:27,502
I have five New York
Times bestselling books

637
00:24:27,502 --> 00:24:29,043
because I have a ghostwriter.

638
00:24:29,043 --> 00:24:31,918
Because I didn't try to
become a great writer

639
00:24:31,918 --> 00:24:33,917
when the blogging thing happened,

640
00:24:33,917 --> 00:24:36,606
because I've bet on my strengths.

641
00:24:36,606 --> 00:24:39,116
And so, I do believe that everybody here

642
00:24:39,116 --> 00:24:40,499
should bet on their strengths

643
00:24:40,499 --> 00:24:42,492
and surround themselves
with their weaknesses.

644
00:24:42,492 --> 00:24:45,417
I actually think back to earlier question,

645
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:48,043
I think AI and machine learning

646
00:24:48,043 --> 00:24:50,419
is gonna help a lot of us
in here who are creative.

647
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:52,785
Close the gap on a lot of our weaknesses

648
00:24:52,785 --> 00:24:54,937
which is gonna be really awesome.

649
00:24:54,937 --> 00:24:55,854
You got it.

650
00:24:56,763 --> 00:24:57,596
Yo, yep.

651
00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:00,215
Kevin.

652
00:25:00,215 --> 00:25:01,374
- It's Kevin, yeah.

653
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,949
I think a lot of people in here,

654
00:25:03,949 --> 00:25:05,068
using ClickFunnels or not,

655
00:25:05,068 --> 00:25:06,329
have kind of come into a lot more money

656
00:25:06,329 --> 00:25:08,476
than maybe they've ever
been used to making.

657
00:25:08,476 --> 00:25:11,013
And in one of your previous sentences,

658
00:25:11,013 --> 00:25:13,170
you said, yeah you only care about money

659
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,753
and all of a sudden you're 47

660
00:25:14,753 --> 00:25:16,899
but then, you didn't finish your sentence.

661
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:19,139
I was hoping to like here,
you elaborate on that.

662
00:25:19,139 --> 00:25:19,972
- Sure.

663
00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:23,537
I'm sure a lot of people here

664
00:25:23,537 --> 00:25:26,286
who let's say have come into money,

665
00:25:26,286 --> 00:25:28,947
it's not as great as
advertised for a lot of people.

666
00:25:28,947 --> 00:25:29,780
Some people love it.

667
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,402
They like watches and Lambos and houses

668
00:25:32,402 --> 00:25:35,680
and that's fuckin rad, like mazal tov.

669
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,676
You know, other people don't

670
00:25:38,676 --> 00:25:41,292
and you start questioning
what the fuck, right?

671
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:43,255
Because when you've got nothing

672
00:25:43,255 --> 00:25:44,579
and you're on the come up

673
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:45,787
and you've got numbers in your head.

674
00:25:45,787 --> 00:25:46,689
Whether it's a million or five

675
00:25:46,689 --> 00:25:48,679
or three or whatever the fuck it is,

676
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:52,278
it's fuckin' empty when you
get there for a lot of people.

677
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:53,859
And so you know, I'm
just trying to make sure

678
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:55,900
people are being thoughtful.

679
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,393
Much like what I just said to Marshall.

680
00:25:57,393 --> 00:25:59,011
Like life is pretty simple.

681
00:25:59,011 --> 00:26:02,265
Like people play on legacy,
on family, on money.

682
00:26:02,265 --> 00:26:04,264
Like there's just of couple pillars.

683
00:26:04,264 --> 00:26:06,373
I just think in our space right now.

684
00:26:06,373 --> 00:26:08,123
I know a lot of you have
heard me rant on this.

685
00:26:08,123 --> 00:26:10,166
I do think entrepreneurship

686
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:12,828
has taken a turn towards club promotion.

687
00:26:12,828 --> 00:26:15,161
Like, that's just dangerous.

688
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:18,337
It's just dangerous for
the people that are gonna,

689
00:26:18,337 --> 00:26:20,071
it's not, I don't give a fuck.

690
00:26:20,071 --> 00:26:22,020
It's dangerous because
people don't realize

691
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,461
they need to build a business,

692
00:26:24,461 --> 00:26:28,388
not a perception that
they're good at business.

693
00:26:28,388 --> 00:26:31,471
(attendees applauds)

694
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:37,464
'Cause, nobody's, you know
when the market crashes,

695
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:39,482
nobody's going to Vegas with you

696
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:42,389
when you work at Bank of fuckin' 'Merica.

697
00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:43,514
You know, I'm just trying to get people

698
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:45,347
to be more thoughtful.

699
00:26:46,678 --> 00:26:47,748
Sure, hey, man.

700
00:26:47,748 --> 00:26:48,581
- How you doin'?

701
00:26:48,581 --> 00:26:49,414
- I'm super well.

702
00:26:49,414 --> 00:26:51,877
- Awesome, so Russell and you are two,

703
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:54,200
well, last year I was selling websites.

704
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,442
I was getting really frustrated

705
00:26:55,442 --> 00:26:57,017
that I wasn't helping people.

706
00:26:57,017 --> 00:26:58,507
I felt like they weren't
growing their sales,

707
00:26:58,507 --> 00:27:00,418
but they had a really nice site.

708
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,466
So you guys inspired
me to start a podcast.

709
00:27:02,466 --> 00:27:03,299
- Awesome.

710
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:05,546
- Didn't know exactly what for but just.

711
00:27:05,546 --> 00:27:06,876
- You were like fuck it,
those guys are doing it,

712
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,291
I will too?

713
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:09,963
- More along the lines of us listening

714
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:11,430
to a podcast in the gym.

715
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,925
Host asked the other guy,

716
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:14,498
what would you tell your 20 year-old self?

717
00:27:14,498 --> 00:27:18,395
And the guy answered I would
divorce my wife earlier.

718
00:27:18,395 --> 00:27:20,178
I was super pissed off.

719
00:27:20,178 --> 00:27:21,389
I'm married with two young kids

720
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:24,908
and wanted to have a podcast
from a different perspective

721
00:27:24,908 --> 00:27:26,401
and so a year later,

722
00:27:26,401 --> 00:27:27,352
thank God, two weeks ago,

723
00:27:27,352 --> 00:27:30,075
I got to publish my
interview with Russell.

724
00:27:30,075 --> 00:27:32,981
I've had Dean Graziosi
and so my question is,

725
00:27:32,981 --> 00:27:36,714
number one is, how do
you grow even further?

726
00:27:36,714 --> 00:27:38,128
And number two is, not just for me,

727
00:27:38,128 --> 00:27:40,986
but anybody's starting or in progress,

728
00:27:40,986 --> 00:27:43,609
what should your priorities be?

729
00:27:43,609 --> 00:27:44,852
- So, let's sit here.

730
00:27:44,852 --> 00:27:47,746
You know both of those
things I can't answer,

731
00:27:47,746 --> 00:27:50,269
because you need to decide what.

732
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:52,434
First of all you have to
define growing for me.

733
00:27:52,434 --> 00:27:54,376
Is growing being a top 50 podcast?

734
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:56,121
I mean like we all get
into our micro games

735
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:58,444
and by the way, I think
micro games are good.

736
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,719
You know, little short goals,
micro, it's kinda good.

737
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:02,831
You scratch it, it's fun for a little bit.

738
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:05,241
I think you got to have
your macro point of view.

739
00:28:05,241 --> 00:28:07,681
Like if you're telling me the truth

740
00:28:07,681 --> 00:28:09,657
that you felt like the conversations

741
00:28:09,657 --> 00:28:10,865
were going in the wrong directions

742
00:28:10,865 --> 00:28:12,947
and you want it to go a different place,

743
00:28:12,947 --> 00:28:15,054
well the answer to your
question is just do it every day

744
00:28:15,054 --> 00:28:17,003
until you're dead, right?

745
00:28:17,003 --> 00:28:18,125
Like that's my plan.

746
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:21,736
My plan is, you know, hopefully it gets me

747
00:28:21,736 --> 00:28:23,473
to like this one little funny weird thing

748
00:28:23,473 --> 00:28:24,636
that I want to buy a football team,

749
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,179
but other than that,

750
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:28,421
my plan is to put out shit for free,

751
00:28:28,421 --> 00:28:30,081
that is historically correct,

752
00:28:30,081 --> 00:28:32,447
so I can continue to
live the life I'm living,

753
00:28:32,447 --> 00:28:36,224
which is I made the money I
wanted to make a long time ago.

754
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:39,958
But getting 50, 60, 70
emails, 80 emails a day

755
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:41,985
of people like fuck, you helped me,

756
00:28:41,985 --> 00:28:43,640
like that's just like intoxicating

757
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,006
but that's what gets
me off and by the way,

758
00:28:46,006 --> 00:28:48,026
I'm not sure that like,

759
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,018
I understand why that
wouldn't be meaningful

760
00:28:50,018 --> 00:28:51,511
to somebody else like
so you just have to do

761
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:54,285
what you have to do for yourself, right?

762
00:28:54,285 --> 00:28:57,618
Like that's how you grow by consistency.

763
00:29:00,402 --> 00:29:02,016
You know, you grow by year and year in.

764
00:29:02,016 --> 00:29:04,541
You grow when you're 19
years into your podcast.

765
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:06,829
- More specifically, in
terms of actual numbers,

766
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,816
and taking the what you've done and

767
00:29:08,816 --> 00:29:11,796
now like, specifically on
the number aspect of it.

768
00:29:11,796 --> 00:29:14,354
What do you recommend in
terms of taking your platform

769
00:29:14,354 --> 00:29:16,504
and kinda skyrocketing numbers?

770
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,921
- Buy under priced attention.

771
00:29:19,905 --> 00:29:23,921
Whether that's buying ads on
Facebook and Snapchat right now

772
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:25,869
'cause they're under priced,

773
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:27,644
if that's working with influencers

774
00:29:27,644 --> 00:29:30,829
because many are still under priced,

775
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:32,440
whether that's taking the high risk

776
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,042
of trying to make a 10 to $50,000 version

777
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:37,699
of what you just saw,
their incredible video,

778
00:29:37,699 --> 00:29:38,856
because that one video

779
00:29:38,856 --> 00:29:42,386
can be your Dollar Shave
Club of your brand.

780
00:29:42,386 --> 00:29:44,673
Saying yes to everything.

781
00:29:44,673 --> 00:29:47,406
Like if you want it, if you're hungry,

782
00:29:47,406 --> 00:29:50,548
you do what I did which
is four years ago when,

783
00:29:50,548 --> 00:29:52,039
I didn't jump into podcasting right away.

784
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:54,157
The first two years, I
just went on everyone's.

785
00:29:54,157 --> 00:29:57,383
And so I could have went
to sleep at 11:00 p.m.

786
00:29:57,383 --> 00:30:00,400
or I could have went on
Lewis Howes's podcast 11 p.m.

787
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,806
Like that was a decision.

788
00:30:01,806 --> 00:30:03,953
It's just about awareness.

789
00:30:03,953 --> 00:30:06,313
Like where are the eyeballs?

790
00:30:06,313 --> 00:30:10,044
And so just put your time
and effort into that.

791
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:13,313
Some of it's free, some of it costs money.

792
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:14,230
You got it?

793
00:30:15,721 --> 00:30:17,047
- Hey, Gary.
- hey, brother.

794
00:30:17,047 --> 00:30:17,880
- My first time seeing you,

795
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,867
your honesty is so beautiful

796
00:30:19,867 --> 00:30:21,651
and it's just wonderful listening to you.

797
00:30:21,651 --> 00:30:22,851
- [Gary] Appreciate it, bro.

798
00:30:22,851 --> 00:30:24,306
- As someone who is trying
to like build their brand,

799
00:30:24,306 --> 00:30:26,721
you know, get a podcast
and get more to Facebook

800
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:28,592
and all these other things, journals.

801
00:30:28,592 --> 00:30:29,757
What kind of some tips you have

802
00:30:29,757 --> 00:30:31,679
for building like a
powerhouse team around you

803
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,460
to help you accomplish all these things?

804
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,026
- First, it has to be, so stay here.

805
00:30:35,026 --> 00:30:36,392
First it has to be practical.

806
00:30:36,392 --> 00:30:38,883
So some people in here can afford people,

807
00:30:38,883 --> 00:30:40,339
other people can't.

808
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,415
So they either have to learn
how to do it themselves

809
00:30:42,415 --> 00:30:45,638
by spending hours looking
at YouTube videos on how to

810
00:30:45,638 --> 00:30:48,206
or read or finding people.

811
00:30:48,206 --> 00:30:49,910
Like we're an incredible era right now.

812
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:54,401
There are so many kids, 14
to 21, that wanna be creators

813
00:30:54,401 --> 00:30:57,840
and I think it's cool
to like do it for free.

814
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,278
So you just need to test and learn.

815
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:03,677
Guys, everybody's overthinking.

816
00:31:03,677 --> 00:31:05,994
Just do, like I don't know post right now,

817
00:31:05,994 --> 00:31:07,649
like literally right now,
as soon as you sit down,

818
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:10,058
like go on fuckin' whatever
platform has the most,

819
00:31:10,058 --> 00:31:11,350
go on all of them be like

820
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,758
I'm looking for a video and audio intern

821
00:31:13,758 --> 00:31:15,706
and see what the fuck happens.

822
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:17,771
Like again, I always tell
people watch what I do,

823
00:31:17,771 --> 00:31:19,608
not what I say.

824
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:21,097
I know a lot of, you know,
there's good amount of people

825
00:31:21,097 --> 00:31:23,577
I see there that follow me,
like randomly out of no,

826
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:24,650
I fuckin' tweeted today,

827
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,733
does anybody make customizable
retail floor mats?

828
00:31:30,901 --> 00:31:33,595
I needed it, I needed a retail floor mat.

829
00:31:33,595 --> 00:31:34,678
Like, you do?

830
00:31:35,512 --> 00:31:36,345
- [Man] I do.

831
00:31:36,345 --> 00:31:37,293
- Good!

832
00:31:37,293 --> 00:31:41,014
Do you do them for free in
exchange for some awareness?

833
00:31:41,014 --> 00:31:45,181
Like, I would ask and then
try somebody and be like,

834
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:48,711
the amount of people I've hired,

835
00:31:48,711 --> 00:31:49,874
when it was early in something

836
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:51,578
and I didn't know if
they were good or bad,

837
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:54,552
I just thought it was
much smarter to just do it

838
00:31:54,552 --> 00:31:56,208
and then figure it out if it was working

839
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:58,821
and then like oh fuck, they sucked.

840
00:31:58,821 --> 00:32:01,189
I'm just not scared to waste money or time

841
00:32:01,189 --> 00:32:03,096
and everybody's petrified

842
00:32:03,096 --> 00:32:05,696
because you worry about what
other people think about you.

843
00:32:05,696 --> 00:32:09,642
That's why, if you're curious,
that's the fuckin' answer.

844
00:32:09,642 --> 00:32:11,447
That's the fuckin', see ya,

845
00:32:11,447 --> 00:32:13,146
that's the fuckin' answer.

846
00:32:13,146 --> 00:32:15,455
You're answer's so easy.

847
00:32:15,455 --> 00:32:16,288
How do you build a team?

848
00:32:16,288 --> 00:32:17,824
Hire some fuckin' people, bro.

849
00:32:17,824 --> 00:32:20,657
(attendees laugh)

850
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:22,963
Right?

851
00:32:22,963 --> 00:32:25,027
But it's like, but you're
like, but I don't understand.

852
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:27,105
Like people are scared to get had

853
00:32:27,105 --> 00:32:28,751
'cause they don't get it, okay?

854
00:32:28,751 --> 00:32:30,787
Put in a shitload of
time to learn the craft

855
00:32:30,787 --> 00:32:34,147
or bring someone in and watch
what they're doing carefully,

856
00:32:34,147 --> 00:32:36,921
instead of like outsourcing
it and fuckin' falling asleep

857
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,625
because you're all fuckin' passive income

858
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:42,792
and I got a team doing shit
and I'm fuckin' stupid.

859
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,658
Got it?

860
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:45,491
- [Man] Thanks.

861
00:32:45,491 --> 00:32:46,324
- Yeah.

862
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:49,842
- [Jay] Hey, Gary.

863
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:50,675
- Hey, Jay.

864
00:32:50,675 --> 00:32:53,443
- My name is Jay and I run
The Inner Changemaker podcast

865
00:32:53,443 --> 00:32:56,253
and I wanna ask a question
that goes a little deeper

866
00:32:56,253 --> 00:32:57,909
with what you're saying in terms of sound

867
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:58,742
and you're watching what you do.

868
00:32:58,742 --> 00:32:59,760
- [Gary] Sure.

869
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,791
- We've noticed that you've
launched a couple other podcasts

870
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:04,701
outside of #AskGaryVee.

871
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:07,016
- [Gary] Within my experience,

872
00:33:07,016 --> 00:33:08,505
you mean like the Brown
Paper Bags and that shit?

873
00:33:08,505 --> 00:33:09,338
Okay.
- The Brown Paper bags.

874
00:33:09,338 --> 00:33:11,229
Kind of like the 365 daily.

875
00:33:11,229 --> 00:33:12,062
So it--

876
00:33:12,062 --> 00:33:14,219
- The 365 is an Alexa skill.

877
00:33:14,219 --> 00:33:15,130
- [Jay] Right, okay.

878
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,532
- A briefing, excuse me.

879
00:33:16,532 --> 00:33:19,642
So, I've been doing sub
branding in my podcast.

880
00:33:19,642 --> 00:33:20,599
- [Jay] Yeah.

881
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,550
- Because I'm testing to
see if there's traction

882
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,750
and I'll spin them out

883
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,366
and create new pillars.
- I see.

884
00:33:26,366 --> 00:33:29,850
Okay, so I guess my real
question is for content creators

885
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,338
that started on like one platform.

886
00:33:32,338 --> 00:33:35,604
For example, I started an
interview based show, right?

887
00:33:35,604 --> 00:33:37,948
Just kinda like you have,
you know a Q and A show.

888
00:33:37,948 --> 00:33:38,899
- [Gary] Yes.

889
00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:41,709
- If you kinda have that
urge to kinda branch out.

890
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:42,910
- [Gary] Do it within the interview show,

891
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,070
'cause you have a audience there?

892
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:44,903
- [Jay] Yeah.

893
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:46,815
- Don't worry that you
may lose a couple people.

894
00:33:46,815 --> 00:33:48,839
Like right now, as I'm
sure everybody has seen

895
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:51,486
for two strategic reasons.

896
00:33:51,486 --> 00:33:52,692
Out of nowhere I'm talking

897
00:33:52,692 --> 00:33:55,377
a lot more than I should
be about wine, right?

898
00:33:55,377 --> 00:33:57,037
I'm doing it for a reason.

899
00:33:57,037 --> 00:34:00,101
There is no question that
there's people unfollowing me,

900
00:34:00,101 --> 00:34:01,427
'cause like, yo bro, I fuckin' came here

901
00:34:01,427 --> 00:34:03,834
to fuckin' get pumped up
because I have no fuckin' juice.

902
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:07,672
The fuck are you trying to
sell me actual juice, right?

903
00:34:07,672 --> 00:34:10,505
So, but I don't give a fuck

904
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:13,257
because I'm playing up like a macro game.

905
00:34:13,257 --> 00:34:15,129
Like I don't wanna lose people from it.

906
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:18,853
I'm sad, I don't wanna
disrespect your attention

907
00:34:18,853 --> 00:34:21,909
and know what you came for
but I need to test something

908
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:23,314
and this is what I have.

909
00:34:23,315 --> 00:34:25,676
And so I think it's better
off for you to like try it

910
00:34:25,676 --> 00:34:28,366
because one, you may hit paydirt.

911
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:29,815
You know, one thing a lot
of people don't realize

912
00:34:29,815 --> 00:34:33,540
is your numbers look good
but they disguising the fact

913
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,059
that you've plateaued and you're tired.

914
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:39,541
And so I think you try it within it

915
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:41,754
and you take the risk of a little decline

916
00:34:41,754 --> 00:34:45,185
for enormous upside because
you can always go back.

917
00:34:45,185 --> 00:34:46,260
- [Jay] Right.

918
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,549
- Instead of starting a whole new thing

919
00:34:47,549 --> 00:34:49,081
that's gonna take energy, got it?

920
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:49,914
- [Jay] Got it.

921
00:34:49,915 --> 00:34:50,748
- Cool.

922
00:34:50,748 --> 00:34:51,581
- [Jay] Appreciate it.

923
00:34:51,581 --> 00:34:52,481
- You're welcome.

924
00:34:52,481 --> 00:34:53,313
- [Prince] Hey, Gary.

925
00:34:53,313 --> 00:34:54,146
- Like your hat, bro.

926
00:34:54,147 --> 00:34:55,149
- Thank you, appreciate that.

927
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:56,146
My name is Prince.

928
00:34:56,146 --> 00:34:57,928
I run a company called Art of Visuals.

929
00:34:57,928 --> 00:35:01,906
We have over a million content
creators in 122 countries.

930
00:35:01,906 --> 00:35:05,637
You said something earlier
about everyone 14 to 22

931
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:07,342
wants to be a content creator.

932
00:35:07,342 --> 00:35:08,590
I absolutely agree with that

933
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,944
and have a tons of those
people in my community.

934
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:12,846
The problem is with there

935
00:35:12,846 --> 00:35:15,316
being so many content creators now,

936
00:35:15,316 --> 00:35:17,911
how do these content creators,

937
00:35:17,911 --> 00:35:19,160
how do they create a business?

938
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,786
How do they make money when.

939
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:21,999
- By being better.
- We have thousands of people

940
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:22,982
doing it for free, et cetera?

941
00:35:22,982 --> 00:35:25,065
- [Gary] By being better.

942
00:35:27,287 --> 00:35:28,241
- Cool.

943
00:35:28,241 --> 00:35:32,330
- Yeah, it's, you know, it,
guys, it's supply and demand.

944
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,786
And then once there's too much supply,

945
00:35:34,786 --> 00:35:39,020
you have to be the best and
just move on to the next thing.

946
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,771
Like I bought all the Google
AdWords of every wine term

947
00:35:41,771 --> 00:35:43,878
for five cents a click the day it started.

948
00:35:43,878 --> 00:35:46,093
That was good, then everybody jumped on,

949
00:35:46,093 --> 00:35:48,039
they started becoming two and
three and four dollar words

950
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:49,181
and became different.

951
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:50,841
Then I had to be better,
then I had be more crafty,

952
00:35:50,841 --> 00:35:52,916
then what I started doing is the day

953
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:54,798
the Wine Spectator would
come out with good scores,

954
00:35:54,798 --> 00:35:57,215
we would buy that exact
wine, that exact vintage,

955
00:35:57,215 --> 00:35:59,638
that became our new
arbitrage for a year or two

956
00:35:59,638 --> 00:36:02,217
before everybody caught up.

957
00:36:02,217 --> 00:36:06,945
When a market's mature,
you've got to be better.

958
00:36:06,945 --> 00:36:07,778
- Do you think it's good enough

959
00:36:07,778 --> 00:36:09,353
just to be a content creator?

960
00:36:09,353 --> 00:36:10,186
- Nope.
- Do you think those

961
00:36:10,186 --> 00:36:12,760
content creators need to also
have products and other things

962
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,298
that they're pushing as well?

963
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:15,131
Besides the art.
- Look, if you're

964
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,212
fuckin' Steven Spielberg,

965
00:36:16,212 --> 00:36:19,091
you probably could end up
just being a content creator,

966
00:36:19,091 --> 00:36:21,754
but if you're like Sal, you know,

967
00:36:21,754 --> 00:36:24,827
maybe you've got to consider
other revenue streams.

968
00:36:24,827 --> 00:36:25,763
You know?

969
00:36:25,763 --> 00:36:26,596
- [Prince] Right.

970
00:36:26,596 --> 00:36:28,146
- It's just very basic business.

971
00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:30,147
Supply and demand, Prince, right?

972
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:32,755
Four years ago there are
people that land grabbed.

973
00:36:32,755 --> 00:36:35,196
They were good and they were first.

974
00:36:35,196 --> 00:36:36,653
It's just real estate.

975
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,065
If you were the people that bought

976
00:36:38,065 --> 00:36:41,565
Malibu beachfront property first, you won.

977
00:36:43,688 --> 00:36:44,521
Right, boys?

978
00:36:44,521 --> 00:36:45,679
You won, you made money.

979
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:47,842
But there's a reason you were the first.

980
00:36:47,842 --> 00:36:50,925
It wasn't fuckin' Malibu yet, Prince.

981
00:36:52,468 --> 00:36:55,702
And now people who buy
Malibu beachfront properties,

982
00:36:55,702 --> 00:36:58,151
they're just better.

983
00:36:58,151 --> 00:37:00,182
So all those kids that like,

984
00:37:00,182 --> 00:37:02,720
they're gonna aspire to be the next this,

985
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,045
they've got a rude awakening.

986
00:37:04,045 --> 00:37:07,898
To be the next this, you've
got to be five times better.

987
00:37:07,898 --> 00:37:09,348
It's evolution.

988
00:37:09,348 --> 00:37:11,331
When people debate these
athletes versus others,

989
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:13,512
yet these athletes would destroy

990
00:37:13,512 --> 00:37:16,191
every athlete from other generations

991
00:37:16,191 --> 00:37:18,588
because they work out 24/7 now.

992
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:20,324
They have data now.

993
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:22,561
Like it hurts my feelings
too that my childhood,

994
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:25,311
they would get fuckin' destroyed.

995
00:37:26,357 --> 00:37:30,641
LeBron would step on
people's heads in the 80s.

996
00:37:30,641 --> 00:37:31,565
Like people don't get it.

997
00:37:31,565 --> 00:37:33,801
It's just fuckin' evolution.

998
00:37:33,801 --> 00:37:34,634
- [Prince] Cool, thanks Gary.

999
00:37:34,634 --> 00:37:35,717
- You got it.

1000
00:37:36,831 --> 00:37:38,450
Great hat.

1001
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,163
- [Jer] Thanks, man.

1002
00:37:40,163 --> 00:37:42,729
I don't really have asked for you,

1003
00:37:42,729 --> 00:37:43,562
- Of course.
- I have listened to,

1004
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:44,863
I mean I've watched your stuff a ton.

1005
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:45,696
- Thanks, Jer.

1006
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,008
- Um, I just want to say thank you

1007
00:37:47,008 --> 00:37:50,576
for giving me the permission
to pursue my passion

1008
00:37:50,576 --> 00:37:53,159
and now do what I love everyday

1009
00:37:54,104 --> 00:37:57,775
and spend time with my
family and make things.

1010
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:01,401
And I'd be remiss if
I didn't say thank you

1011
00:38:01,401 --> 00:38:02,602
because I don't know if I'll ever see you.

1012
00:38:02,602 --> 00:38:04,379
If you ever wanna play bubble hockey,

1013
00:38:04,379 --> 00:38:06,071
I'll destroy you.

1014
00:38:06,071 --> 00:38:08,638
- [Gary] Dude, thanks.

1015
00:38:08,638 --> 00:38:09,471
- And I know

1016
00:38:09,471 --> 00:38:11,256
that you say that you'll--
- Are you filming this?

1017
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,089
Where do you live?

1018
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:12,922
Well, first of all--

1019
00:38:12,922 --> 00:38:13,755
- I live here.

1020
00:38:13,755 --> 00:38:14,588
There's a spot right down the street

1021
00:38:14,588 --> 00:38:17,284
I can take you to play.
- Listen, listen.

1022
00:38:17,284 --> 00:38:18,899
Listen that's gonna happen now, I think.

1023
00:38:18,899 --> 00:38:20,929
- I'm a winner in Boise, Idaho, Gary.

1024
00:38:20,929 --> 00:38:23,339
- It's so crazy, you see,
you're funny, you're smart,

1025
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:25,460
you know me, you know that
now I'm getting click,

1026
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,578
now I'm blacked out and
wanna destroy your face.

1027
00:38:27,578 --> 00:38:29,465
- [Jer] I know.

1028
00:38:29,465 --> 00:38:31,752
- But the only, you know
what's more interesting though?

1029
00:38:31,752 --> 00:38:33,702
Your fuckin' Whalers hat is fuckin' me up,

1030
00:38:33,702 --> 00:38:35,609
because I'm like fuck man,

1031
00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:36,815
he's got a Hartford Whalers hat.

1032
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,008
This team hasn't been in the
league for 20 fuckin' years,

1033
00:38:39,008 --> 00:38:41,995
he probably is awesome at bubble hockey.

1034
00:38:41,995 --> 00:38:45,191
I'm gonna do something for real
based on what you just said.

1035
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:46,721
I want you to come to
Vaynermedia for a day.

1036
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:49,340
I'll pay for your flight
and the hotel and during.

1037
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,709
(attendees cheering and applauding)

1038
00:38:50,709 --> 00:38:54,810
And during that day,
we'll play bubble hockey

1039
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,259
and we'll see what's up.

1040
00:38:56,259 --> 00:39:00,426
(attendees applauding and cheering)

1041
00:39:05,861 --> 00:39:06,815
- Hello, Gary.

1042
00:39:06,815 --> 00:39:09,220
I first want to say thank
you to both you and Russell.

1043
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,961
You two are kind of like

1044
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:12,867
the Jesus of marketing and branding.

1045
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:15,603
I come from a poor little
country, the Dominican Republic,

1046
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,592
and if it wasn't for you
two, I wouldn't be here.

1047
00:39:17,592 --> 00:39:18,631
- Thank you.
- So I just wanna say

1048
00:39:18,631 --> 00:39:19,464
thank you.

1049
00:39:19,464 --> 00:39:21,110
So my question right now is like,

1050
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,430
what are you doing in other languages?

1051
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,999
Because right now, like my
main language is in Spanish

1052
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:27,485
and I see like a blue ocean.

1053
00:39:27,485 --> 00:39:28,980
Russell is always
talking about blue ocean.

1054
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,813
- [Gary] He's right.

1055
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:31,982
- And all the language is ridiculous,

1056
00:39:31,982 --> 00:39:32,971
the blue ocean that there is.

1057
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:35,251
Marketing, fitness, whatever, you name it.

1058
00:39:35,251 --> 00:39:37,528
The ocean's blue, so I wanna
know what are you doing?

1059
00:39:37,528 --> 00:39:40,557
'Cause I'm going balls deep into Spanish.

1060
00:39:40,557 --> 00:39:43,581
- So what I've been doing
over the last six months,

1061
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,244
I've poured an ungodly amount of money

1062
00:39:45,244 --> 00:39:47,437
into infrastructure to
transcribe all my content

1063
00:39:47,437 --> 00:39:50,740
into a ton of languages and
paid distribution in them.

1064
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,725
I'm spending an, I'm going to Singapore,

1065
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:57,165
which is my second trip to
Asia in the last three months.

1066
00:39:57,165 --> 00:39:59,612
Going to Mainland China in January.

1067
00:39:59,612 --> 00:40:00,576
I'm going to India in February.

1068
00:40:00,576 --> 00:40:03,391
I'm spending an enormous amount of time

1069
00:40:03,391 --> 00:40:06,322
and I'll spend millions
of dollars next year

1070
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:09,676
just on the transcription, the
distribution of the content

1071
00:40:09,676 --> 00:40:12,742
that I'm natively making in
America in the English language.

1072
00:40:12,742 --> 00:40:14,242
So a solid amount.

1073
00:40:15,106 --> 00:40:17,311
- Okay, I'm so into like influencers,

1074
00:40:17,311 --> 00:40:18,144
influencer marketing in other language,

1075
00:40:18,144 --> 00:40:19,672
like it's cheap in English,

1076
00:40:19,672 --> 00:40:22,905
in Spanish is pennies on the buck, so.

1077
00:40:22,905 --> 00:40:24,481
- It's super, I mean you know, again,

1078
00:40:24,481 --> 00:40:25,314
'cause I just can't,

1079
00:40:25,314 --> 00:40:26,219
'cause I'd miss and I haven't see,

1080
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:28,415
it'd be like I remember when Jerome and I,

1081
00:40:28,415 --> 00:40:29,918
I was like Jerome you
need to go and figure out

1082
00:40:29,918 --> 00:40:32,295
who these fuckin'
influencers are in Mexico

1083
00:40:32,295 --> 00:40:34,912
because they're like
even in music right now,

1084
00:40:34,912 --> 00:40:36,782
there's so many, like I'm spending a lot.

1085
00:40:36,782 --> 00:40:37,988
Maybe you guys are paying attention

1086
00:40:37,988 --> 00:40:38,821
because I love hip-hop.

1087
00:40:38,821 --> 00:40:40,013
I'm spending more time with these artists.

1088
00:40:40,013 --> 00:40:41,803
Like I keep telling them

1089
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:44,995
like you need to go down to South America.

1090
00:40:44,995 --> 00:40:47,356
There's so many artists there
that are really popping.

1091
00:40:47,356 --> 00:40:49,879
You have the leverage
'cause the brand of America,

1092
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:51,527
I mean they're much
bigger artists than you,

1093
00:40:51,527 --> 00:40:53,356
but you're America.

1094
00:40:53,356 --> 00:40:55,595
So you're automatically bigger than them.

1095
00:40:55,595 --> 00:40:58,268
Yeah, I mean, I totally agree.

1096
00:40:58,268 --> 00:40:59,101
- [Man] Well, thank you.

1097
00:40:59,101 --> 00:41:00,761
- You got it, good luck.

1098
00:41:00,761 --> 00:41:03,844
(attendees applauds)

1099
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:06,595
- Gary, Caleb Maddix's dad.

1100
00:41:06,595 --> 00:41:10,905
I wanna thank you personally
for your impact in his life.

1101
00:41:10,905 --> 00:41:13,397
Between you and Russell
Brunson, seriously.

1102
00:41:13,397 --> 00:41:16,168
I mean coming from a dad,
there's no way I can repay you.

1103
00:41:16,168 --> 00:41:17,205
- [Gary] I appreciate that.

1104
00:41:17,205 --> 00:41:19,024
- Just that the character
that you've taught him,

1105
00:41:19,024 --> 00:41:20,348
so I thank you for that.

1106
00:41:20,348 --> 00:41:21,489
I have two-part question.

1107
00:41:21,489 --> 00:41:23,341
One, you gave him some advice

1108
00:41:23,341 --> 00:41:25,298
last time you're with him about patience.

1109
00:41:25,298 --> 00:41:26,203
- Australia.
- I hear you talk

1110
00:41:26,203 --> 00:41:27,455
about that a lot

1111
00:41:27,455 --> 00:41:29,734
and I wanna know is that dad you know,

1112
00:41:29,734 --> 00:41:31,762
can you expound a little bit more on that?

1113
00:41:31,762 --> 00:41:33,454
And then the I'll wait
'til you answer that,

1114
00:41:33,454 --> 00:41:34,658
and I'll have one more part about that.

1115
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:35,782
- Right, so you know it's super fun

1116
00:41:35,782 --> 00:41:36,812
for some of us in the space.

1117
00:41:36,812 --> 00:41:38,594
We're literally watching your son grow up

1118
00:41:38,594 --> 00:41:40,904
and I mean, I just saw
him, like fuck dude.

1119
00:41:40,904 --> 00:41:42,931
Yeah, you don't look 14 anymore.

1120
00:41:42,931 --> 00:41:45,574
Like you know, and now he's hanging around

1121
00:41:45,574 --> 00:41:46,648
with all these fuck faces

1122
00:41:46,648 --> 00:41:48,145
so he's gonna get into trouble, right?

1123
00:41:48,145 --> 00:41:52,312
Like patience is important
because he's got more swag now.

1124
00:41:53,707 --> 00:41:54,963
His sneaker game is stronger,

1125
00:41:54,963 --> 00:41:56,750
like he's going into that time of his life

1126
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,995
where dumb fuckin'
decisions are gonna be made

1127
00:41:58,995 --> 00:42:02,008
because he's making decisions
to make short-term cash

1128
00:42:02,008 --> 00:42:03,664
because he's trying to arbitrage it

1129
00:42:03,664 --> 00:42:05,122
for other things in his life.

1130
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,478
Like, why do I preach patience?

1131
00:42:07,478 --> 00:42:09,624
Because it's the only thing
that keeps people away

1132
00:42:09,624 --> 00:42:13,016
from being straight fuckin' assholes.

1133
00:42:13,016 --> 00:42:13,849
- That's good.

1134
00:42:13,849 --> 00:42:14,682
- [Gary] Thanks.

1135
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:16,549
- Alright, so what did your dad do?

1136
00:42:16,549 --> 00:42:17,789
You know, you talked about he coached--

1137
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:19,486
- I didn't have my dad in my life.

1138
00:42:19,486 --> 00:42:22,104
Like, I mean, luckily
still have my dad in my,

1139
00:42:22,104 --> 00:42:23,011
I didn't know my dad

1140
00:42:23,011 --> 00:42:24,713
until I started working in a liquor store.

1141
00:42:24,713 --> 00:42:26,745
Like my dad left before I woke up

1142
00:42:26,745 --> 00:42:27,781
and came home after I slept.

1143
00:42:27,781 --> 00:42:28,732
Like as a matter fact,

1144
00:42:28,732 --> 00:42:30,020
it's probably funny how
I feel about you guys.

1145
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,260
It's fun to watch because I
didn't have that, you know?

1146
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,715
But what my dad did do for me, ironically,

1147
00:42:34,715 --> 00:42:38,882
is because I have that kind
of salesmanship and charisma,

1148
00:42:39,822 --> 00:42:42,142
I was completely full of shit.

1149
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,926
Like I would be,

1150
00:42:43,926 --> 00:42:47,297
everything I make fun of, subtly,

1151
00:42:47,297 --> 00:42:49,370
I would be, if it wasn't for my dad.

1152
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:51,739
'Cause at 14, 15, I went
to that liquor store

1153
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:52,853
and you would walk into that,

1154
00:42:52,853 --> 00:42:55,124
it was called Shoppers
Discount Liquors back there.

1155
00:42:55,124 --> 00:42:57,987
I was 14 years old, I looked 9.

1156
00:42:57,987 --> 00:43:00,302
You'd walk in and be like
do you have this product?

1157
00:43:00,302 --> 00:43:01,135
And I'd be like yeah that we,

1158
00:43:01,135 --> 00:43:02,664
'cause I was already full sales kid.

1159
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:03,948
I'm like we have that product,

1160
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:05,356
but I knew we made more money on this one.

1161
00:43:05,356 --> 00:43:06,683
I was like but this one's better.

1162
00:43:06,683 --> 00:43:09,469
I had it, it was phenomenal, I'm 14.

1163
00:43:09,469 --> 00:43:10,669
(attendees laughing)

1164
00:43:10,669 --> 00:43:11,920
People were like, you had it?

1165
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,373
Like yeah, it's my dad's store I taste it.

1166
00:43:13,373 --> 00:43:16,478
I mean I don't think I,
talk about making shit up.

1167
00:43:16,478 --> 00:43:19,632
I don't think I said a real thing once.

1168
00:43:19,632 --> 00:43:24,123
And so my dad took me and
he taught me (spits) that.

1169
00:43:24,123 --> 00:43:27,062
My dad thinks embellishing
is straight lying

1170
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,955
and he suffocated me
over a three-year period

1171
00:43:29,955 --> 00:43:32,971
that really changed the course of my life.

1172
00:43:32,971 --> 00:43:35,414
And I think a lot of my success comes from

1173
00:43:35,414 --> 00:43:39,647
I have all the skill
sets of that character

1174
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:43,814
but between being old country
and really, really my dad

1175
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,615
really not allowing me to be that guy,

1176
00:43:47,615 --> 00:43:50,637
so that's what he did for me
and I think that's what you,

1177
00:43:50,637 --> 00:43:53,936
as a dad, you need to just
keep watching him evolve

1178
00:43:53,936 --> 00:43:55,632
and when he goes into territories

1179
00:43:55,632 --> 00:43:58,158
that you think are historically incorrect.

1180
00:43:58,158 --> 00:44:00,733
Not new ideas and doing new shit.

1181
00:44:00,733 --> 00:44:05,476
No, tried and true fuckin' human
dynamics that win and lose,

1182
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,192
that's how you try to guide it.

1183
00:44:07,192 --> 00:44:08,227
- Yeah, one more if you don't mind.

1184
00:44:08,227 --> 00:44:10,843
I'm sure a lot of these people
probably have kids as well.

1185
00:44:10,843 --> 00:44:13,285
So like your dad was
a powerful businessman

1186
00:44:13,285 --> 00:44:16,766
and you had a lot of ideas
and passion as a young age.

1187
00:44:16,766 --> 00:44:18,385
What did he do to not like,

1188
00:44:18,385 --> 00:44:20,522
how did you guys balance that?

1189
00:44:20,522 --> 00:44:22,313
Was that decision of him

1190
00:44:22,313 --> 00:44:24,058
making you stop sell baseball cards

1191
00:44:24,058 --> 00:44:25,845
to come work in the liquor store.

1192
00:44:25,845 --> 00:44:27,011
Was that the right decision?

1193
00:44:27,011 --> 00:44:28,670
Would you do that for your kids?

1194
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,292
I'm only asking out of curiosity

1195
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,448
because when I hear that I'm
just very curious about it.

1196
00:44:32,448 --> 00:44:33,451
- It's a tricky one, man.

1197
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:34,864
First of all we were an insular family,

1198
00:44:34,864 --> 00:44:36,067
we're an immigrant family.

1199
00:44:36,067 --> 00:44:36,900
We didn't know shit.

1200
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,845
There was no internet, like
we didn't know anything.

1201
00:44:38,845 --> 00:44:41,211
We literally just
thought when you turn 14,

1202
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:42,232
you go work at the store.

1203
00:44:42,232 --> 00:44:44,025
We were merchants, like right?

1204
00:44:44,025 --> 00:44:45,960
Like you know people like that,

1205
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,124
you know that cliche story.

1206
00:44:47,124 --> 00:44:48,201
It's just what it was,

1207
00:44:48,201 --> 00:44:50,598
it was my 14th birthday,
it was fuckin' time.

1208
00:44:50,598 --> 00:44:51,966
You know my Ds and Fs in school

1209
00:44:51,966 --> 00:44:53,715
weren't helping me with
any compelling reason

1210
00:44:53,715 --> 00:44:55,969
that I could get out of it.

1211
00:44:55,969 --> 00:44:59,823
So you know, as far as how we did it,

1212
00:44:59,823 --> 00:45:01,869
we fuckin' fought tooth and,

1213
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:04,761
I fought for every inch I
had and then I got lucky.

1214
00:45:04,761 --> 00:45:07,784
What happened was when
I came from college,

1215
00:45:07,784 --> 00:45:09,637
my dad had saved up a lot
of money through these years

1216
00:45:09,637 --> 00:45:12,817
and started building a dream
house for him and my mom

1217
00:45:12,817 --> 00:45:15,993
and he took that year off
and he was just not around.

1218
00:45:15,993 --> 00:45:16,986
And that year I took the business

1219
00:45:16,986 --> 00:45:19,698
from three to 10 million dollars in sales

1220
00:45:19,698 --> 00:45:22,373
and that was the end of the debate.

1221
00:45:22,373 --> 00:45:25,358
- [Matt] Awesome, thank you man.

1222
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:26,273
Appreciate it, Gary.

1223
00:45:26,273 --> 00:45:27,106
- Thanks brother.

1224
00:45:27,106 --> 00:45:28,360
Hi.

1225
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,146
- [Sarah] Hi, my name is Sarah.

1226
00:45:30,146 --> 00:45:31,262
- Hi Sarah.

1227
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:32,796
- [Sarah] I'm really enjoying your speech,

1228
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,549
so thank you.
- Thank you.

1229
00:45:34,549 --> 00:45:37,199
- I was wondering in retrospect.

1230
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:39,231
You've built a brand around
yourself and your name.

1231
00:45:39,231 --> 00:45:40,763
- [Gary] Yes.

1232
00:45:40,763 --> 00:45:43,168
- Is that what you would
recommend looking forward

1233
00:45:43,168 --> 00:45:46,279
or rather more of a brand around a brand?

1234
00:45:46,279 --> 00:45:48,769
- I think you have to do both

1235
00:45:48,769 --> 00:45:50,725
if you're gonna build it around yourself,

1236
00:45:50,725 --> 00:45:51,760
because what you're alluding to

1237
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,918
is you can get pigeonholed

1238
00:45:52,918 --> 00:45:55,043
and you live and die by the person.

1239
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,987
I think a lot of people forget with me,

1240
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,811
I built my library first.

1241
00:45:58,811 --> 00:46:00,478
Gary Vee came later.

1242
00:46:01,585 --> 00:46:04,330
So it's not like I went
the Caleb route, per se.

1243
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:08,303
I didn't come up the game as me and so,

1244
00:46:08,303 --> 00:46:09,136
I know how to build.

1245
00:46:09,136 --> 00:46:12,154
Like I'm seriously, it's a
little bit fucked up now.

1246
00:46:12,154 --> 00:46:14,361
I don't think I could pull
it off but I kind of wanna,

1247
00:46:14,361 --> 00:46:16,098
actually you just inspired me, Sarah.

1248
00:46:16,098 --> 00:46:19,374
I'm literally gonna build a
25 million dollar business

1249
00:46:19,374 --> 00:46:21,926
in the next three years
that nobody knows is mine,

1250
00:46:21,926 --> 00:46:24,168
just to remind everybody, for myself

1251
00:46:24,168 --> 00:46:26,253
'cause I'm weird like that and I need it,

1252
00:46:26,253 --> 00:46:28,490
like, that I built businesses.

1253
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:31,799
Now let me promise everybody
in this room one thing.

1254
00:46:31,799 --> 00:46:35,799
Fame is the number one
arbitrage in our society.

1255
00:46:37,154 --> 00:46:39,237
Fame is not Snapchat ads,

1256
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:43,316
not being the first result on Google.

1257
00:46:43,316 --> 00:46:44,149
Fame.

1258
00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:48,982
Full brand awareness is
the number one arbitrage,

1259
00:46:48,982 --> 00:46:52,649
so I've built my brand
as a biz dev machine.

1260
00:46:55,843 --> 00:46:59,327
- Sure, well I'm glad I can inspire you.

1261
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,768
(attendees laughing)

1262
00:47:00,768 --> 00:47:03,768
And let me know if you need a goalie

1263
00:47:04,811 --> 00:47:06,220
on your bubble hockey,

1264
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,549
'cause I think I could be pretty amazing.

1265
00:47:07,549 --> 00:47:09,618
- I might, he's got a
Whalers hat, I'm scared.

1266
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:10,569
- [Sarah] Thank you.

1267
00:47:10,569 --> 00:47:11,402
- Awesome.

1268
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:13,967
- [Rachel] Hi Gary.

1269
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:14,809
- Hey Rachel.

1270
00:47:14,809 --> 00:47:15,647
(Rachel gasps)

1271
00:47:15,647 --> 00:47:16,480
- You have a name tag.

1272
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,191
- Oh, I got so excited.

1273
00:47:19,191 --> 00:47:20,608
Okay, I'm Rachel.

1274
00:47:22,029 --> 00:47:25,463
Wow, that was like cool for
a second then it wasn't.

1275
00:47:25,463 --> 00:47:27,951
So I'm the mom of two young daughters.

1276
00:47:27,951 --> 00:47:28,979
I've got a third on the way.

1277
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:29,932
- [Gary] Congrats.

1278
00:47:29,932 --> 00:47:30,930
- And it's awesome.

1279
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:32,506
Being a parent is obviously

1280
00:47:32,506 --> 00:47:34,826
quite challenging as an entrepreneur.

1281
00:47:34,826 --> 00:47:37,149
You talk a lot about what you were taught

1282
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:39,839
through entrepreneurship
through your dad's mistakes

1283
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,771
and successes and you've
had a lot of success

1284
00:47:42,771 --> 00:47:44,059
as an entrepreneur.

1285
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:45,929
So for your, you have two kids, right?

1286
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:46,803
- [Gary] I do.

1287
00:47:46,803 --> 00:47:48,826
- What are the three
main things that you hope

1288
00:47:48,826 --> 00:47:50,784
that they get out of life

1289
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:51,859
and how are you gonna instill

1290
00:47:51,859 --> 00:47:53,766
those three principles into them?

1291
00:47:53,766 --> 00:47:57,031
- The biggest reason I'm
obsessed with entrepreneurship

1292
00:47:57,031 --> 00:48:00,965
is it's the clearest thing
and most obvious thing to me

1293
00:48:00,965 --> 00:48:02,535
that allows you to do the following,

1294
00:48:02,535 --> 00:48:06,285
which is do what you
want to do today, right?

1295
00:48:07,337 --> 00:48:09,573
Like waking up and being able to do

1296
00:48:09,573 --> 00:48:12,507
whatever the fuck you
wanna do is incredible.

1297
00:48:12,507 --> 00:48:15,530
So the only thing that I want for my kids

1298
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:18,189
like from that standpoint
is the ability to do

1299
00:48:18,189 --> 00:48:19,803
what they wanna do everyday.

1300
00:48:19,803 --> 00:48:22,608
Now, what scares me about that

1301
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:26,912
is they're probably gonna
have that no matter what

1302
00:48:26,912 --> 00:48:29,522
because they're gonna
inherent extreme wealth.

1303
00:48:29,522 --> 00:48:32,097
So much so that I've really
been having feelings.

1304
00:48:32,097 --> 00:48:34,380
I used to make fun of Warren
Buffett and Bill Gates

1305
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,993
in my head of like,

1306
00:48:35,993 --> 00:48:39,388
you're gonna donate 99% of your money?

1307
00:48:39,388 --> 00:48:40,343
You know it's funny.

1308
00:48:40,343 --> 00:48:43,152
You talk shit until you live shit, right?

1309
00:48:43,152 --> 00:48:45,805
Now, I'm like, fuck, I don't
wanna give these kids shit.

1310
00:48:45,805 --> 00:48:46,834
Fuck that.

1311
00:48:46,834 --> 00:48:47,667
(attendees laughing)

1312
00:48:47,667 --> 00:48:51,584
Like because rich kids
have a huge disadvantage

1313
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:55,683
because when I wanted
Sega Genesis in 1989,

1314
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:59,292
my mom's like cool, go get it, right?

1315
00:48:59,292 --> 00:49:02,262
You know, like when I wanted
to go to a Knicks game,

1316
00:49:02,262 --> 00:49:03,885
I had to sell baseball cards and shit,

1317
00:49:03,885 --> 00:49:07,201
sit in the fuckin' you
know, like fuckin' top row.

1318
00:49:07,201 --> 00:49:08,971
Fuckin' Carmelo's coming
over my Hamptons house

1319
00:49:08,971 --> 00:49:12,118
to play with Xander, like it's fucked up.

1320
00:49:12,118 --> 00:49:13,868
So I don't know what,

1321
00:49:16,884 --> 00:49:18,373
but here are the things
I give a fuck about.

1322
00:49:18,373 --> 00:49:20,497
Number one, more than anything.

1323
00:49:20,497 --> 00:49:24,585
And I will kill them, murder, go to jail.

1324
00:49:24,585 --> 00:49:26,360
They have to be kind.

1325
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,384
Kindness is the most important.

1326
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:33,648
Number two, if I ever
see them even a innuendo,

1327
00:49:33,648 --> 00:49:36,698
even a subtle little joke of imposing

1328
00:49:36,698 --> 00:49:40,630
my and my wife's wealth on somebody else

1329
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:42,578
because they think they're part of that,

1330
00:49:42,578 --> 00:49:44,403
I'll break their fuckin' neck.

1331
00:49:44,403 --> 00:49:45,855
(attendees laughing)

1332
00:49:45,855 --> 00:49:47,395
And then number three,

1333
00:49:47,395 --> 00:49:48,303
I will not raise them

1334
00:49:48,303 --> 00:49:51,587
in the political correct
environment we live in now.

1335
00:49:51,587 --> 00:49:55,471
They know there is no such
thing as fourth place trophies

1336
00:49:55,471 --> 00:49:57,804
or participation prizes.

1337
00:49:57,804 --> 00:50:01,519
(attendees applauds)

1338
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:04,602
So, now if they want to be nonprofit.

1339
00:50:06,812 --> 00:50:08,759
You know, look they're gonna
look at daddy's mountain

1340
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:10,247
and they'll be like fuck that,

1341
00:50:10,247 --> 00:50:12,075
or they maybe do what I do.

1342
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:13,357
You know, my dad's things seem big,

1343
00:50:13,357 --> 00:50:14,682
mine's gonna be a hell of a lot bigger.

1344
00:50:14,682 --> 00:50:16,879
But like other people have
made it bigger than me

1345
00:50:16,879 --> 00:50:18,039
and kids have done this.

1346
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:19,861
They're gonna look at that
and they're gonna say,

1347
00:50:19,861 --> 00:50:21,691
fuck that, I'm going the other way.

1348
00:50:21,691 --> 00:50:24,912
I'm building schools in Afghanistan

1349
00:50:24,912 --> 00:50:26,117
or they're gonna be like fuck it,

1350
00:50:26,117 --> 00:50:27,241
I'm gonna climb that mountain.

1351
00:50:27,241 --> 00:50:29,872
I'm gonna stick it to big mouth.

1352
00:50:29,872 --> 00:50:32,971
I don't care, I don't need
my kids to be entrepreneurs.

1353
00:50:32,971 --> 00:50:34,175
I just need them to be as lucky as,

1354
00:50:34,175 --> 00:50:36,574
my mom, I got Ds and Fs.

1355
00:50:36,574 --> 00:50:38,965
Every immigrant got
good grades in the 80s.

1356
00:50:38,965 --> 00:50:40,384
There's a couple of people
a little older here,

1357
00:50:40,384 --> 00:50:41,750
there was no entrepreneurship.

1358
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:42,711
School.

1359
00:50:42,711 --> 00:50:43,873
Good school.

1360
00:50:43,873 --> 00:50:45,374
That was it.

1361
00:50:45,374 --> 00:50:49,598
My mom spit, spit in the
faces of all those parents

1362
00:50:49,598 --> 00:50:52,853
that made fun of my Ds and
Fs and gave me air cover

1363
00:50:52,853 --> 00:50:56,038
to be me and it really fuckin' worked out.

1364
00:50:56,038 --> 00:51:00,521
Not only for me, but the
world became it, right?

1365
00:51:00,521 --> 00:51:03,771
If my kids wanna paint in tomato sauce,

1366
00:51:04,614 --> 00:51:08,299
I will back them to the Earth's end

1367
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:10,357
as long as that's really
why they're doing it,

1368
00:51:10,357 --> 00:51:12,819
not because they're
doing something to like

1369
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,087
run away from themselves or that nature.

1370
00:51:14,087 --> 00:51:17,920
So just blind support
as long as they're kind.

1371
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:19,901
- And the last thing I wanted to say

1372
00:51:19,901 --> 00:51:24,426
is I'm gonna buy the Minnesota
Vikings so I'll see you.

1373
00:51:24,426 --> 00:51:26,455
- Super Bowl?
- In the owner's club.

1374
00:51:26,455 --> 00:51:27,866
- No, no, and, Super Bowl.

1375
00:51:27,866 --> 00:51:31,199
Jets, Vikings, 2047, I'll see you there.

1376
00:51:32,303 --> 00:51:33,136
(attendees applauds)

1377
00:51:33,136 --> 00:51:35,219
- I love this, thank you.

1378
00:51:37,952 --> 00:51:40,854
- Hi Bren, haven't seen
you, what's up, Bren?

1379
00:51:40,854 --> 00:51:41,687
Hi Dan.

1380
00:51:41,687 --> 00:51:42,919
- My question is about time.

1381
00:51:42,919 --> 00:51:43,752
- [Gary] Time.

1382
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:45,742
- So you're an angel investor
in a hundred companies,

1383
00:51:45,742 --> 00:51:47,990
you have books, an 800 person agency

1384
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:50,681
and a family and it's unreal to watch

1385
00:51:50,681 --> 00:51:52,261
how much content you're putting out.

1386
00:51:52,261 --> 00:51:54,861
How do you choose between the
thousands of startup pitches

1387
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:58,005
you're getting and the which
interview to do or which

1388
00:51:58,005 --> 00:51:59,329
speaking event to do?
- Conference to come.

1389
00:51:59,329 --> 00:52:00,658
- It's just so much.

1390
00:52:00,658 --> 00:52:04,075
- 100% blind belief in my intuition.

1391
00:52:07,686 --> 00:52:09,091
(attendees laughing)

1392
00:52:09,091 --> 00:52:10,537
'Cause Dan, you know this in you and Bren,

1393
00:52:10,537 --> 00:52:11,663
everyone's hustling, right?

1394
00:52:11,663 --> 00:52:14,078
Like, eventually you lose, right?

1395
00:52:14,078 --> 00:52:15,946
Like, eventually time,
you don't have enough time

1396
00:52:15,946 --> 00:52:16,948
to do all the opportunity,

1397
00:52:16,948 --> 00:52:19,523
so you're crippled by opportunity.

1398
00:52:19,523 --> 00:52:21,353
You just have to go that route,

1399
00:52:21,353 --> 00:52:22,887
otherwise, you're just
gonna spend all your time

1400
00:52:22,887 --> 00:52:26,451
thinking about the process
of making the best decision

1401
00:52:26,451 --> 00:52:28,149
and it's, you know, and you're gonna waste

1402
00:52:28,149 --> 00:52:29,402
being able to do four things

1403
00:52:29,402 --> 00:52:30,773
which would have included the two things

1404
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:33,962
you've been debating for
the last fuckin' day.

1405
00:52:33,962 --> 00:52:36,123
So just the belief in my intuition

1406
00:52:36,123 --> 00:52:38,901
and then lots of making fun of yourself.

1407
00:52:38,901 --> 00:52:40,393
This one is a perfect example.

1408
00:52:40,393 --> 00:52:43,678
I have to like, talk about time.

1409
00:52:43,678 --> 00:52:45,369
My son has a birthday now

1410
00:52:45,369 --> 00:52:46,202
'cause he's got an August birthday.

1411
00:52:46,202 --> 00:52:47,965
I didn't realize it
was like this Saturday,

1412
00:52:47,965 --> 00:52:50,325
like and I think it actually
came after we booked this,

1413
00:52:50,325 --> 00:52:53,603
but like all the money and from this talk

1414
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:54,968
is going into the fuckin',

1415
00:52:54,968 --> 00:52:56,133
I was originally gonna go to Seattle

1416
00:52:56,133 --> 00:52:57,328
then now I have to take a private plane

1417
00:52:57,328 --> 00:52:58,161
not to miss the flight.

1418
00:52:58,161 --> 00:52:58,994
Like I just fucked it up

1419
00:52:58,994 --> 00:52:59,879
and the whole day, I'm just complaining.

1420
00:52:59,879 --> 00:53:01,240
I'm like, I'm a fuckin' idiot.

1421
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,567
So like you're not always
gonna make it right.

1422
00:53:03,567 --> 00:53:06,246
Like you're always gonna
like play micro, macro.

1423
00:53:06,246 --> 00:53:09,079
But I think everybody's saying no.

1424
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:12,254
Everybody's saying no to shit

1425
00:53:12,254 --> 00:53:13,957
because they think
they're being thoughtful

1426
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,448
or they're smart.

1427
00:53:15,448 --> 00:53:17,982
Like you know how many
people are saying no

1428
00:53:17,982 --> 00:53:21,904
that aren't even fancy
enough to say yes yet?

1429
00:53:21,904 --> 00:53:24,290
So I just say yes, man, a lot.

1430
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:25,248
- [Dan] Thank you.

1431
00:53:25,248 --> 00:53:26,799
- Yeah.

1432
00:53:26,799 --> 00:53:27,925
Hey.

1433
00:53:27,925 --> 00:53:28,758
- [Frank Jay] Hello.

1434
00:53:28,758 --> 00:53:29,591
- Hello.

1435
00:53:29,591 --> 00:53:30,424
- [Frank Jay] Great to meet you.

1436
00:53:30,424 --> 00:53:31,257
- Great to meet you, too, bro.

1437
00:53:31,257 --> 00:53:32,703
- [Frank Jay] I have a
two-part name, Frank Jay.

1438
00:53:32,703 --> 00:53:33,784
- Love it, how are you Frank-Jay?

1439
00:53:33,784 --> 00:53:35,150
- Very good thank you, brother.

1440
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:37,557
I wanna appreciate you
and your dedication,

1441
00:53:37,557 --> 00:53:40,803
your consistency and your communication.

1442
00:53:40,803 --> 00:53:43,572
We own a company called
International Tribe Design

1443
00:53:43,572 --> 00:53:45,800
where we bring a style of communication

1444
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:50,349
which is very simple but
yet rare in the society

1445
00:53:50,349 --> 00:53:52,341
which is honesty and authenticity

1446
00:53:52,341 --> 00:53:54,041
and I feel like you embody this.

1447
00:53:54,041 --> 00:53:56,356
And I feel like a lot of us entrepreneurs,

1448
00:53:56,356 --> 00:53:59,997
well at least for me, it was
like shall I present myself

1449
00:53:59,997 --> 00:54:02,502
strategically or authentically?

1450
00:54:02,502 --> 00:54:03,460
- [Gary] Yeah.

1451
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,790
- And what I wanna ask you

1452
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:05,907
is the first part of the question.

1453
00:54:05,907 --> 00:54:08,566
What do you think sells more
or influence more people,

1454
00:54:08,566 --> 00:54:12,085
authentic honesty or strategic marketing,

1455
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:15,035
Neuro-Linguistic
Programming communication?

1456
00:54:15,035 --> 00:54:19,459
- I think in the short
term, it's a real battle.

1457
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:21,613
I think either could win.

1458
00:54:21,613 --> 00:54:23,943
I think in the 30-year macro,

1459
00:54:23,943 --> 00:54:27,693
the radical candor
authentic way always wins.

1460
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:29,832
You know what I mean?

1461
00:54:29,832 --> 00:54:31,272
And the thing that fucks with people

1462
00:54:31,272 --> 00:54:34,290
is a lot of people can win on strategic,

1463
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:35,869
you're being very politically correct.

1464
00:54:35,869 --> 00:54:38,736
Like a lot of people can win on bullshit,

1465
00:54:38,736 --> 00:54:40,777
play it out for four years,

1466
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:45,044
get out of the game with
their chips and win.

1467
00:54:45,044 --> 00:54:46,878
Not a lot of people can, though.

1468
00:54:46,878 --> 00:54:49,364
But then, once you know
of one of those examples,

1469
00:54:49,364 --> 00:54:53,447
it sounds exciting 'cause
it's a fuckload easier.

1470
00:54:54,829 --> 00:54:57,067
- What do you think the
future is for collaboration

1471
00:54:57,067 --> 00:54:59,391
for as competition?

1472
00:54:59,391 --> 00:55:01,251
So what we're all about is collaboration.

1473
00:55:01,251 --> 00:55:02,408
Let's bring us all together.

1474
00:55:02,408 --> 00:55:04,617
I think we can all do
great things as a team.

1475
00:55:04,617 --> 00:55:06,170
- I think both will work, right?

1476
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,502
Competition matters, right?

1477
00:55:07,502 --> 00:55:09,203
Like I wanna destroy fuckin' Whaler hat.

1478
00:55:09,203 --> 00:55:11,536
I want to kill Vikings girl.

1479
00:55:12,995 --> 00:55:16,233
Like competition matters, right?

1480
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:17,227
Like I'm not gonna like.

1481
00:55:17,227 --> 00:55:18,810
Zenning this all out,

1482
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:21,586
but I'll tell you, like in real life,

1483
00:55:21,586 --> 00:55:24,517
Droga5 let's just put it
even in black and white.

1484
00:55:24,517 --> 00:55:26,132
Droga5, David Droga.

1485
00:55:26,132 --> 00:55:29,042
Phenomenal businessman,
has an incredible agency,

1486
00:55:29,042 --> 00:55:30,331
he's gonna get his.

1487
00:55:30,331 --> 00:55:31,287
Let me tell you one thing

1488
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:32,582
that a lot of you are making mistakes

1489
00:55:32,582 --> 00:55:34,901
'cause you're saying shit
behind people's backs.

1490
00:55:34,901 --> 00:55:38,296
You can't stop winners from winning.

1491
00:55:38,296 --> 00:55:39,296
Winners win.

1492
00:55:40,625 --> 00:55:44,041
So something, I don't remember
when it became obvious to me,

1493
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:44,931
but it's unbelievable.

1494
00:55:44,931 --> 00:55:47,251
If I see a winner, I'm
like she's a winner.

1495
00:55:47,251 --> 00:55:48,084
It's binary.

1496
00:55:48,084 --> 00:55:50,694
Even if she's taking David Droga,

1497
00:55:50,694 --> 00:55:54,221
Winning in My World
alongside Vaynermedia, right?

1498
00:55:54,221 --> 00:55:56,545
I'm pumped, I'm happy for him,

1499
00:55:56,545 --> 00:56:00,852
because if you're also a
winner, you're gonna always eat.

1500
00:56:00,852 --> 00:56:02,179
Winners win.

1501
00:56:02,179 --> 00:56:03,839
A lot of people see
somebody who's a winner

1502
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,044
and they're not there yet

1503
00:56:05,044 --> 00:56:06,789
or they feel like they're
taking away from them,

1504
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:09,199
and they're talking shit.

1505
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:12,829
And really all that's doing
is exposing where you're at.

1506
00:56:12,829 --> 00:56:13,666
Like it's unbelievable.

1507
00:56:13,666 --> 00:56:15,124
You know, I hang out with a lot of people,

1508
00:56:15,124 --> 00:56:16,858
you know, like people
start yapping a little,

1509
00:56:16,858 --> 00:56:19,275
I'm like, winners win, right?

1510
00:56:20,868 --> 00:56:23,677
And so unless you're doing
something really not noble

1511
00:56:23,677 --> 00:56:25,739
or things of that nature, winners win.

1512
00:56:25,739 --> 00:56:28,703
And so I think that I
collaborate with other winners

1513
00:56:28,703 --> 00:56:30,488
who take from me.

1514
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:33,738
Complex and Vice and they're gonna win.

1515
00:56:35,463 --> 00:56:37,745
You're not gonna stop a winner,
and so keep that in mind.

1516
00:56:37,745 --> 00:56:40,153
I think that's something
that does hold back

1517
00:56:40,153 --> 00:56:43,236
this competitive, driven, hungry demo

1518
00:56:44,306 --> 00:56:46,421
more than you might realize.

1519
00:56:46,421 --> 00:56:47,671
Envy is stupid.

1520
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:51,885
It's just not practical.

1521
00:56:51,885 --> 00:56:55,646
I just don't spend any time, like why?

1522
00:56:55,646 --> 00:56:56,804
I don't know.

1523
00:56:56,804 --> 00:56:57,933
- Awesome, appreciate it, brother.

1524
00:56:57,933 --> 00:56:59,549
Thank you.
- Yeah, for sure.

1525
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:00,805
Hey, Rob.

1526
00:57:00,805 --> 00:57:03,204
- [Rob] Gary, great to
be here with you man,

1527
00:57:03,204 --> 00:57:04,037
seriously, live.
- Thanks, man.

1528
00:57:04,037 --> 00:57:05,902
- It's been about three
years since I've been.

1529
00:57:05,902 --> 00:57:08,782
You came across my Facebook feed,

1530
00:57:08,782 --> 00:57:11,190
you were talking to some millennial kid

1531
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:12,475
and you just owned him.

1532
00:57:12,475 --> 00:57:16,288
And you just had me
hooked from that moment.

1533
00:57:16,288 --> 00:57:19,435
But a couple things,
so you talking about--

1534
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:20,602
- I apologize.

1535
00:57:21,881 --> 00:57:26,475
I'm really anti the downplay
of like millennial kids,

1536
00:57:26,475 --> 00:57:27,973
like and I don't think
that's what you're doing,

1537
00:57:27,973 --> 00:57:30,365
but I just figured I'd put it on film.

1538
00:57:30,365 --> 00:57:31,365
Like I'm 42.

1539
00:57:34,137 --> 00:57:36,748
There was plenty of lazy
losers, entitled fuckers

1540
00:57:36,748 --> 00:57:38,689
when I was 22, too.

1541
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:41,097
Like this notion that millennials.

1542
00:57:41,097 --> 00:57:43,052
Like millennials are, first and foremost,

1543
00:57:43,052 --> 00:57:46,183
dramatically better human beings
than any other generation.

1544
00:57:46,183 --> 00:57:48,551
It's actually not even close.

1545
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:50,560
And you can't be mad at them.

1546
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,353
The market, this has nothing
to do with millennials,

1547
00:57:53,353 --> 00:57:56,291
and over parenting, this
has to do with economics.

1548
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:59,070
The last nine years have been phenomenal.

1549
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:00,028
We haven't had a crash.

1550
00:58:00,028 --> 00:58:02,730
How many people here are under 29?

1551
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,348
Raise your hand.

1552
00:58:04,348 --> 00:58:08,714
You've never tasted the
game when it was hard.

1553
00:58:08,714 --> 00:58:11,784
You've never been punched
directly in the fuckin' mouth yet.

1554
00:58:11,784 --> 00:58:12,844
(attendees laughing)

1555
00:58:12,844 --> 00:58:15,120
You don't wake up like I did in April 2000

1556
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,127
and the market collapsed and every invoice

1557
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:18,744
and every order is over.

1558
00:58:18,744 --> 00:58:20,070
You don't know what it feels like

1559
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:22,140
when the corporations that
wanna give you $10,000

1560
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:25,081
for a selfie don't spend money anymore.

1561
00:58:25,081 --> 00:58:26,748
It's a little harder to be an influencer

1562
00:58:26,748 --> 00:58:30,092
when there's no cash in the system.

1563
00:58:30,092 --> 00:58:32,699
So I'm not mad at millennials.

1564
00:58:32,699 --> 00:58:35,648
I'm mad at people's not
understanding of why,

1565
00:58:35,648 --> 00:58:37,822
you know, they're awesome human beings

1566
00:58:37,822 --> 00:58:39,484
'cause they're far more well-rounded

1567
00:58:39,484 --> 00:58:41,807
and they just had it good,
and that's not their fault.

1568
00:58:41,807 --> 00:58:42,764
We could have had that.

1569
00:58:42,764 --> 00:58:44,510
I got into the world in New Jersey.

1570
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:45,790
2000, got shit on.

1571
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:47,241
9/11 got shit on.

1572
00:58:47,241 --> 00:58:48,648
2007 got shit on.

1573
00:58:48,648 --> 00:58:50,315
So I've tasted that.

1574
00:58:51,915 --> 00:58:53,283
So just keep that in mind.

1575
00:58:53,283 --> 00:58:55,647
And by the way, the
reason I told that story

1576
00:58:55,647 --> 00:58:59,125
is please keep in mind that
the economy has been phenomenal

1577
00:58:59,125 --> 00:59:01,156
for the last nine years.

1578
00:59:01,156 --> 00:59:03,858
Like a lot of the good is coming for you

1579
00:59:03,858 --> 00:59:06,394
because of what's
happening at a macro level.

1580
00:59:06,394 --> 00:59:08,061
You're just average.

1581
00:59:09,668 --> 00:59:12,398
I'm being serious, and I'm
not saying that to razz,

1582
00:59:12,398 --> 00:59:14,546
I'm saying that to make you reflect,

1583
00:59:14,546 --> 00:59:16,014
so that you can step up your game

1584
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:19,950
so that when the fuckin'
ravage comes, you don't die.

1585
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:21,989
So good, you got a little
zing that you're average

1586
00:59:21,989 --> 00:59:23,443
but now you can actually stay alive

1587
00:59:23,443 --> 00:59:27,569
and not go work at fuckin',
go back to business school.

1588
00:59:27,569 --> 00:59:29,946
(attendees laughing)

1589
00:59:29,946 --> 00:59:30,779
Sorry, bro

1590
00:59:32,858 --> 00:59:34,648
- Didn't know that was gonna
take you down that course but.

1591
00:59:34,648 --> 00:59:36,354
(laughing)

1592
00:59:36,354 --> 00:59:38,841
So you talk about how companies

1593
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,001
are kinda behind the eight ball

1594
00:59:40,001 --> 00:59:43,080
on the whole social
media, Facebook marketing.

1595
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,949
It's a good value right now.

1596
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:47,593
Are you starting to see
that trend diminish?

1597
00:59:47,593 --> 00:59:48,708
- No.
- And when do you see

1598
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:51,435
that being not a value Facebook?

1599
00:59:51,435 --> 00:59:56,248
- As soon as math again, and
art combine to not be valuable,

1600
00:59:56,248 --> 00:59:58,168
like on television.

1601
00:59:58,168 --> 00:59:59,370
Meanwhile Super Bowl is the best ad.

1602
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:01,061
Anybody here who's got
20 million throw around,

1603
01:00:01,061 --> 01:00:02,970
run a Super Bowl ad this year.

1604
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:04,300
The problem is they're seven.

1605
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,155
It's only seven for the
ad, which is phenomenal,

1606
01:00:06,155 --> 01:00:08,512
but the network makes
you buy some other shit,

1607
01:00:08,512 --> 01:00:09,345
so where it gets fucked up.

1608
01:00:09,345 --> 01:00:12,362
But Super Bowl is an incredible value.

1609
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:14,400
I don't know, I'm stunned
that these big companies

1610
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,055
that I work with still question its ROI

1611
01:00:17,055 --> 01:00:19,662
and wanna run commercials and billboards.

1612
01:00:19,662 --> 01:00:23,422
It's so fun to watch them
all go out of business

1613
01:00:23,422 --> 01:00:26,189
over the next 20 years, they deserve it.

1614
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:28,272
I can't wait, seriously.

1615
01:00:29,569 --> 01:00:32,598
- Last thing is, you mentioned
political correctness

1616
01:00:32,598 --> 01:00:33,898
and your kids which is awesome

1617
01:00:33,898 --> 01:00:35,534
and I think that's what
everyone loves about you

1618
01:00:35,534 --> 01:00:37,524
is you just say what's on your mind.

1619
01:00:37,524 --> 01:00:39,346
And I think we can all take
a page out of that book

1620
01:00:39,346 --> 01:00:41,513
of just being pure honest.

1621
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:46,542
With this crazy climate
of the whole you know,

1622
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:50,022
the Google guy that got fired from there,

1623
01:00:50,022 --> 01:00:51,687
the whole ESPN thing like,

1624
01:00:51,687 --> 01:00:54,023
how do you how do you see
this political correctness

1625
01:00:54,023 --> 01:00:58,190
and what do you do to to
mitigate that in your company?

1626
01:01:00,421 --> 01:01:02,458
- So it's a really good question, Rob,

1627
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:03,409
and it's a really tough one.

1628
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:04,242
Couple things.

1629
01:01:04,242 --> 01:01:06,234
Number one, said something the other day

1630
01:01:06,234 --> 01:01:08,569
that finally articulated
how I feel about all of it,

1631
01:01:08,569 --> 01:01:11,639
which is I said to a
friend like fuck, people.

1632
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:12,969
So there's only one place in my life

1633
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:16,258
where I'm not logical or practical.

1634
01:01:16,258 --> 01:01:18,413
American football, right?

1635
01:01:18,413 --> 01:01:20,246
Like against all data,

1636
01:01:21,276 --> 01:01:24,305
I think that the Patriots are cheaters

1637
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:26,624
and Bill Belichick's a terrible guy

1638
01:01:26,624 --> 01:01:28,483
and even though Tom Brady's like clearly

1639
01:01:28,483 --> 01:01:30,143
and I've like literally spent money

1640
01:01:30,143 --> 01:01:31,385
on investigative journalism,

1641
01:01:31,385 --> 01:01:33,129
he's the nicest human being ever.

1642
01:01:33,129 --> 01:01:34,798
I still say things like yeah,

1643
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:36,495
he left his pregnant wife for Gisele,

1644
01:01:36,495 --> 01:01:41,005
he's a piece of shit, like
I will do anything blindly.

1645
01:01:41,005 --> 01:01:43,728
I've chemically, like
even talking right now,

1646
01:01:43,728 --> 01:01:45,512
the chemicals in my body are different.

1647
01:01:45,512 --> 01:01:46,549
I feel it.

1648
01:01:46,549 --> 01:01:48,224
I hate them so much.

1649
01:01:48,224 --> 01:01:51,224
I really want Bill Belichick to die.

1650
01:01:53,051 --> 01:01:53,884
(attendees laughing)

1651
01:01:53,884 --> 01:01:55,922
Like I don't even, I don't.

1652
01:01:55,922 --> 01:01:56,967
You know it's funny,

1653
01:01:56,967 --> 01:01:58,879
I wonder if people think
like I'm going for,

1654
01:01:58,879 --> 01:02:00,129
like I want it.

1655
01:02:02,834 --> 01:02:05,247
So cool, we've established that, right?

1656
01:02:05,247 --> 01:02:08,336
I'm clearly irrational, over-emotional,

1657
01:02:08,336 --> 01:02:12,226
not logical and just the
worst version of myself

1658
01:02:12,226 --> 01:02:13,685
in that one narrow place.

1659
01:02:13,685 --> 01:02:16,295
I mean there are people
who are fans of me,

1660
01:02:16,295 --> 01:02:19,113
who've DM'd or have
tweeted that I'm a bad guy,

1661
01:02:19,113 --> 01:02:21,429
I mean I yell at children at games.

1662
01:02:21,429 --> 01:02:23,046
I'm not joking.

1663
01:02:23,046 --> 01:02:24,754
You know how people get beer muscles?

1664
01:02:24,754 --> 01:02:25,587
You know that term?

1665
01:02:25,587 --> 01:02:26,656
You drink and you wanna fight?

1666
01:02:26,656 --> 01:02:28,198
I have sports muscles.

1667
01:02:28,198 --> 01:02:29,156
Like I go to a game

1668
01:02:29,156 --> 01:02:30,900
and even though everybody would probably

1669
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,857
be able to beat me up, I wanna fight you

1670
01:02:32,857 --> 01:02:34,805
'cause it feels better
than feeling the pain

1671
01:02:34,805 --> 01:02:37,555
of your team beating mine, right?

1672
01:02:39,157 --> 01:02:40,733
Like a week ago I realized,

1673
01:02:40,733 --> 01:02:43,672
holy fuck, that's how blindly everybody

1674
01:02:43,672 --> 01:02:45,794
is now about politics.

1675
01:02:45,794 --> 01:02:49,158
You're either red or blue
and you deploy no logic,

1676
01:02:49,158 --> 01:02:51,815
no rationale, you are blindly emotional,

1677
01:02:51,815 --> 01:02:53,636
you have no idea what the
fuck you're talking about

1678
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:54,632
and that's it.

1679
01:02:54,632 --> 01:02:57,285
You mean we're about to
turn every issue into a.

1680
01:02:57,285 --> 01:03:00,604
How the fuck is climate a political?

1681
01:03:00,604 --> 01:03:02,840
Like what are we doing here?

1682
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:07,009
So I have a huge office
in New York and LA.

1683
01:03:07,009 --> 01:03:10,837
84% of my employees are liberals.

1684
01:03:10,837 --> 01:03:11,670
84, right?

1685
01:03:13,127 --> 01:03:15,785
And so I have liberal
points of view all day long.

1686
01:03:15,785 --> 01:03:17,234
The thought of hating anybody

1687
01:03:17,234 --> 01:03:19,635
or disliking another
human being for any reason

1688
01:03:19,635 --> 01:03:22,752
other than maybe being a
Patriot is insane to me,

1689
01:03:22,752 --> 01:03:25,493
insane to me, insane to me.

1690
01:03:25,493 --> 01:03:27,618
But I have clearly,

1691
01:03:27,618 --> 01:03:30,477
Republican put like an eighth place trophy

1692
01:03:30,477 --> 01:03:32,711
is why China is gonna shit on us

1693
01:03:32,711 --> 01:03:34,374
with such a big fuckin' dump

1694
01:03:34,374 --> 01:03:37,874
that we'll never be able to breathe again.

1695
01:03:38,768 --> 01:03:43,090
How I handle it is by
one by one, one by one.

1696
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:46,613
It's very, you cannot handle
this at a macro right now

1697
01:03:46,613 --> 01:03:49,113
because our society's on tilt.

1698
01:03:52,843 --> 01:03:55,200
That's how I do it.

1699
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,526
(attendees applauds)

1700
01:03:56,526 --> 01:03:57,526
Thanks, man.

1701
01:03:59,203 --> 01:04:01,524
I'm so fuckin' pissed I
was born in fuckin' Russia.

1702
01:04:01,524 --> 01:04:05,507
I would fuckin' run, win
easy and fuckin' dominate.

1703
01:04:05,507 --> 01:04:09,244
Really would, I'd really
feel like I could do it.

1704
01:04:09,244 --> 01:04:10,077
Josh?

1705
01:04:10,944 --> 01:04:11,777
- [Josh] Gary, I wanna talk about--

1706
01:04:11,777 --> 01:04:12,905
- It was nice meeting
you in the airport, man.

1707
01:04:12,905 --> 01:04:14,774
- Yeah, absolutely, thanks.

1708
01:04:14,774 --> 01:04:15,826
I wanna talk about influencer marketing.

1709
01:04:15,826 --> 01:04:16,865
- [Gary] Yeah.

1710
01:04:16,865 --> 01:04:19,658
- YouTubers, vloggers, Instagramers,

1711
01:04:19,658 --> 01:04:22,275
a lot of people are
talking about Facebook ads,

1712
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:25,015
Instagram ads, Snapchat ads, ROI.

1713
01:04:25,015 --> 01:04:27,214
We can measure ROI with those.

1714
01:04:27,214 --> 01:04:29,045
- You can measure with influencers too.

1715
01:04:29,045 --> 01:04:30,577
- You can but it takes a lot longer.

1716
01:04:30,577 --> 01:04:31,410
- [Gary] No it doesn't.

1717
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:32,243
- How so?

1718
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,082
- You've got to make the creative,

1719
01:04:34,082 --> 01:04:36,357
be a sales creative instead
of a brand creative.

1720
01:04:36,357 --> 01:04:38,428
You can't measure the
ROI of Facebook either

1721
01:04:38,428 --> 01:04:39,801
when you do it the way I do it,

1722
01:04:39,801 --> 01:04:41,879
'cause I'm pumping it for brand.

1723
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:43,821
I'm not trying to sell you shit.

1724
01:04:43,821 --> 01:04:47,071
I can measure it if I had a $49 course.

1725
01:04:48,652 --> 01:04:49,938
- So how--
- Josh, people are confused

1726
01:04:49,938 --> 01:04:52,355
between branding and selling.

1727
01:04:53,864 --> 01:04:56,375
Make fuckin' phenomenal influencers,

1728
01:04:56,375 --> 01:04:58,319
go for the sale in the
creative if they choose to

1729
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,146
and you can afford them.

1730
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,099
Logan Paul sold a
fuckload of Dunkin Donuts

1731
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:04,218
fuckin' gift cards.

1732
01:05:04,218 --> 01:05:07,715
Sales, super fuckin' measurable, Josh.

1733
01:05:07,715 --> 01:05:09,747
- So would you focus, like,

1734
01:05:09,747 --> 01:05:11,659
let's pretend you're not
Gary Vaynerchuk, right?

1735
01:05:11,659 --> 01:05:13,610
Let's take you out of
the equation you are--

1736
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:14,443
- [Gary] Who am I?

1737
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:16,978
- You are a 41 year-old, 42?

1738
01:05:16,978 --> 01:05:17,811
- [Gary] 41 still.

1739
01:05:17,811 --> 01:05:18,644
- 41.

1740
01:05:18,644 --> 01:05:19,749
- Slow your roll.

1741
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:22,277
- You're a 41 year old nobody, right?

1742
01:05:22,277 --> 01:05:25,186
You have say a million dollars
of investors behind you.

1743
01:05:25,186 --> 01:05:27,583
- Well then you're definitely
not nobody if you got that.

1744
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:29,413
That's just contact shit, Joshy.

1745
01:05:29,413 --> 01:05:30,332
- All right, fine, fine.

1746
01:05:30,332 --> 01:05:31,899
You're a 41-year-old nobody.

1747
01:05:31,899 --> 01:05:32,732
- Respect, respect.
- You're getting

1748
01:05:32,732 --> 01:05:34,193
into the game, right?

1749
01:05:34,193 --> 01:05:36,090
Will you focus on growing
your personal brand,

1750
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:37,212
or would you focus on leveraging

1751
01:05:37,212 --> 01:05:38,775
other people's personal brands

1752
01:05:38,775 --> 01:05:39,996
that are already a thing?
- Both.

1753
01:05:39,996 --> 01:05:43,205
- So would you ride the backs of,

1754
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:46,227
using the people that
you're building like,

1755
01:05:46,227 --> 01:05:47,763
that you're investing in?

1756
01:05:47,763 --> 01:05:48,846
- Sure, yeah.

1757
01:05:50,090 --> 01:05:50,923
- [Josh] Okay.

1758
01:05:50,923 --> 01:05:51,787
- Like if you're trying
to, are you asking?

1759
01:05:51,787 --> 01:05:54,327
Josh, what are you asking?

1760
01:05:54,327 --> 01:05:55,616
I'll give you the answer.

1761
01:05:55,616 --> 01:05:58,179
You're trying to build
your personal brand?

1762
01:05:58,179 --> 01:05:59,553
- I am trying to build my personal brand.

1763
01:05:59,553 --> 01:06:00,843
- Thank you.
- Yeah, absolutely.

1764
01:06:00,843 --> 01:06:01,970
- Are you thinking about, are you trying--

1765
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:03,385
- But I wanna build my personal brand

1766
01:06:03,385 --> 01:06:06,411
in a different niche than the influencers

1767
01:06:06,411 --> 01:06:07,285
that I wanna invest in.

1768
01:06:07,285 --> 01:06:08,118
- Understood.

1769
01:06:08,118 --> 01:06:10,728
I think that as long, understand this.

1770
01:06:10,728 --> 01:06:13,091
Just because they may
be in a different niche,

1771
01:06:13,091 --> 01:06:14,625
they have so much awareness

1772
01:06:14,625 --> 01:06:16,284
that the people that watch them

1773
01:06:16,284 --> 01:06:19,034
may be into other things, got it?

1774
01:06:19,957 --> 01:06:20,910
- [Josh] Yep.

1775
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:22,816
- So if it's a good deal on awareness,

1776
01:06:22,816 --> 01:06:24,693
you might be able to convert,

1777
01:06:24,693 --> 01:06:26,563
and then your product has to be good.

1778
01:06:26,563 --> 01:06:27,396
- [Josh] Cool.

1779
01:06:27,396 --> 01:06:28,229
- Do you know what I mean?

1780
01:06:28,229 --> 01:06:29,062
- Yeah.
- Like that's the math

1781
01:06:29,062 --> 01:06:29,895
you're looking at.

1782
01:06:29,895 --> 01:06:32,665
You don't have to use the
targeted nature of the ads

1783
01:06:32,665 --> 01:06:34,699
if the influencers are a better deal,

1784
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:37,145
even though you might
lose 85% of the audience

1785
01:06:37,145 --> 01:06:39,470
because that's not why
they're watching them,

1786
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:42,709
but they're still gonna
get 15% of opportunity

1787
01:06:42,709 --> 01:06:45,163
and then the whole fuckin'
kit and caboodle is,

1788
01:06:45,163 --> 01:06:47,355
are you good enough?

1789
01:06:47,355 --> 01:06:49,111
- All right, one last question.

1790
01:06:49,111 --> 01:06:52,029
I'm a diehard, diehard Patriots fan.

1791
01:06:52,029 --> 01:06:54,566
If Tom Brady makes it to
a Super Bowl this year

1792
01:06:54,566 --> 01:06:57,605
will you go to the Super
Bowl with me, on me?

1793
01:06:57,605 --> 01:06:58,438
- No.

1794
01:06:58,438 --> 01:06:59,271
- [Josh] No?

1795
01:06:59,271 --> 01:07:00,104
All right.

1796
01:07:00,104 --> 01:07:01,057
- And not only that.

1797
01:07:01,057 --> 01:07:02,430
I've been to the last six Super Bowls,

1798
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:04,128
they've been there two or three times,

1799
01:07:04,128 --> 01:07:06,497
you know and I'm now with
VaynerSports and Steve Ross,

1800
01:07:06,497 --> 01:07:08,327
the owner of the Dolphins is
my business partner so I go

1801
01:07:08,327 --> 01:07:10,203
and the owner's dinner, it's all fun.

1802
01:07:10,203 --> 01:07:13,834
The last two Super Bowls, two
of the last three Super Bowls,

1803
01:07:13,834 --> 01:07:15,836
I left the city Sunday.

1804
01:07:15,836 --> 01:07:19,189
I've not watched the Patriots play a down

1805
01:07:19,189 --> 01:07:21,403
of a Super Bowl game in
the last four Super Bowls

1806
01:07:21,403 --> 01:07:23,678
that they've played in because I refuse.

1807
01:07:23,678 --> 01:07:26,177
Everybody's like the greatest
comeback in a Super Bowl.

1808
01:07:26,177 --> 01:07:27,181
I'm good, I have no idea

1809
01:07:27,181 --> 01:07:28,189
what the fuck you guys are talking about.

1810
01:07:28,189 --> 01:07:29,676
I didn't see shit.

1811
01:07:29,676 --> 01:07:30,757
- Well you like winners,

1812
01:07:30,757 --> 01:07:31,966
and I'd like to invite
you to the winning team.

1813
01:07:31,966 --> 01:07:32,799
Anytime you wanna come.

1814
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:35,704
- No, no, Josh, Josh,
you're confused, my friend.

1815
01:07:35,704 --> 01:07:36,703
I'm a winner.

1816
01:07:36,703 --> 01:07:38,237
You root for winners, dick.

1817
01:07:38,237 --> 01:07:39,070
(attendees jeering and laughing)

1818
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:40,278
- Yeah, true, that's very true.

1819
01:07:40,278 --> 01:07:41,982
That's very true.

1820
01:07:41,982 --> 01:07:43,311
- [Gary] Be careful.

1821
01:07:43,311 --> 01:07:44,561
- Thanks, Gary.

1822
01:07:49,281 --> 01:07:51,236
- That, by the way, you just
witnessed my favorite move.

1823
01:07:51,236 --> 01:07:54,257
Knicks-Heat game, seven
years ago, dude walks by,

1824
01:07:54,257 --> 01:07:56,011
beer, remember sports muscles.

1825
01:07:56,011 --> 01:07:58,683
Guys, I get up I'm like, you fuckin' suck,

1826
01:07:58,683 --> 01:07:59,804
sit the fuck down.

1827
01:07:59,804 --> 01:08:01,679
I mean it, I get weird.

1828
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:03,812
He looks at me goes yeah we suck,

1829
01:08:03,812 --> 01:08:05,189
look at the scoreboard, asshole.

1830
01:08:05,189 --> 01:08:08,272
I go not them, you asshole, you suck.

1831
01:08:10,835 --> 01:08:12,788
By the way the darkest
version of what you just saw

1832
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:15,105
and Josh knows I love him
but the darkest version,

1833
01:08:15,105 --> 01:08:16,725
I go to Foxborough for every game,

1834
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:18,506
we always get shit on.

1835
01:08:18,506 --> 01:08:19,661
Around the third, fourth quarter

1836
01:08:19,661 --> 01:08:20,904
when I'm really getting shit on

1837
01:08:20,904 --> 01:08:22,060
because I bring my Jets jersey,

1838
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:25,643
I'm fuckin' running in
there proper, right?

1839
01:08:27,022 --> 01:08:28,385
Somewhere around the fourth quarter,

1840
01:08:28,385 --> 01:08:29,558
when I'm getting shit on,

1841
01:08:29,558 --> 01:08:30,723
I change the conversation.

1842
01:08:30,723 --> 01:08:32,206
I'm like look Zan,

1843
01:08:32,206 --> 01:08:34,981
I'm super pumped that
your entire self esteem

1844
01:08:34,981 --> 01:08:36,395
is wrapped into your football team

1845
01:08:36,395 --> 01:08:39,388
because you work at Pizza
Hut and so fuck you,

1846
01:08:39,388 --> 01:08:41,461
my life's better than yours.

1847
01:08:41,461 --> 01:08:43,578
Maybe your football
team is better than mine

1848
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:45,995
but I'm better than you, Zan.

1849
01:08:49,178 --> 01:08:50,011
Jared.

1850
01:08:50,011 --> 01:08:51,206
- Hey Gary.

1851
01:08:51,206 --> 01:08:53,567
So going back a little bit,

1852
01:08:53,567 --> 01:08:55,397
you talked about intuition, right?

1853
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:56,412
And belief in your intuition.

1854
01:08:56,412 --> 01:08:57,715
- Yes.

1855
01:08:57,716 --> 01:08:59,746
- I'm a two day idea guy, right?

1856
01:08:59,746 --> 01:09:00,999
I get an idea and then.

1857
01:09:00,999 --> 01:09:01,832
- Yeah, me too, man.

1858
01:09:01,832 --> 01:09:03,330
- After two days, I'm like
that was a crappy idea.

1859
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:04,328
- And you're being nice, man.

1860
01:09:04,328 --> 01:09:07,167
You probably like a seven
that you let too, right?

1861
01:09:07,167 --> 01:09:08,207
More, right, Nicole?

1862
01:09:08,207 --> 01:09:10,327
Like he bothers the
fuck out of you, right?

1863
01:09:10,328 --> 01:09:11,161
- [Jared] Yeah.

1864
01:09:11,161 --> 01:09:13,474
- He's like what about a
drone ice-cream company?

1865
01:09:13,474 --> 01:09:14,307
(attendees laughing)

1866
01:09:14,307 --> 01:09:15,140
Go ahead.

1867
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:15,973
- That's a good idea!

1868
01:09:15,973 --> 01:09:17,140
- Thanks, man.

1869
01:09:18,881 --> 01:09:21,444
- So how do you develop that intuition

1870
01:09:21,444 --> 01:09:23,819
and how do you like support
and strengthen your belief

1871
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:24,816
in your own intuition?

1872
01:09:24,817 --> 01:09:27,885
- By acting on some of them.

1873
01:09:27,885 --> 01:09:30,038
The biggest problem is,
especially when you have like,

1874
01:09:30,038 --> 01:09:33,670
people around you, is like
you wanna be right, right?

1875
01:09:33,671 --> 01:09:35,580
Like it's much better
than getting made fun of

1876
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:36,828
for being wrong consistently.

1877
01:09:36,828 --> 01:09:39,901
But like by fuckin' picking like just by.

1878
01:09:39,902 --> 01:09:41,644
I try to do stuff every, you know,

1879
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:43,179
everyone's like, oh
you you're always in it

1880
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,930
like doing like, just trying shit.

1881
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,889
Like nobody talks about the
stuff that I'm doing that.

1882
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:50,127
Guys, nobody remembers the
part where Michael Jordan

1883
01:09:50,127 --> 01:09:51,783
couldn't get to the finals

1884
01:09:51,783 --> 01:09:55,781
because the Pistons were
beating him every single time.

1885
01:09:55,781 --> 01:09:56,985
You know what I mean?

1886
01:09:56,985 --> 01:10:00,583
Guys, let me really unleash
you doing more shit.

1887
01:10:00,583 --> 01:10:04,750
Nobody remembers the losses
as long as you have a win.

1888
01:10:07,695 --> 01:10:09,270
And you know?

1889
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:11,274
Listen, some of you know my stuff

1890
01:10:11,274 --> 01:10:13,639
and like I'm starting to
like figure out my own stuff.

1891
01:10:13,639 --> 01:10:16,430
It comes down to six people.

1892
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:19,552
Your mom, your dad, your
siblings, your loved ones.

1893
01:10:19,552 --> 01:10:22,695
You're doing so much shit
based on their points of view

1894
01:10:22,695 --> 01:10:25,282
on stuff, you can't even imagine.

1895
01:10:25,282 --> 01:10:27,712
You can unwind that,
you're off to the races.

1896
01:10:27,712 --> 01:10:31,879
It scares me how much I value
my wife and parents' opinion,

1897
01:10:33,385 --> 01:10:35,501
and how much I don't at all.

1898
01:10:35,501 --> 01:10:37,751
And in that balance, I win.

1899
01:10:39,317 --> 01:10:41,200
At a macro, I value them,

1900
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,617
but on a micro, my decisions, not at all.

1901
01:10:46,298 --> 01:10:49,581
You know Jared, so you just
got a do one or two of them.

1902
01:10:49,581 --> 01:10:53,748
You go one for seven, it's a
lot better than going O for O.

1903
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,481
- [Jared] Yeah, thank you.

1904
01:10:56,481 --> 01:10:57,314
- You got it.

1905
01:10:57,314 --> 01:10:58,147
- Last question.

1906
01:10:58,147 --> 01:10:59,361
- Yeah, sign it?

1907
01:10:59,361 --> 01:11:00,518
- Yeah, could you sign my book?

1908
01:11:00,518 --> 01:11:01,351
- A hundred percent.

1909
01:11:01,351 --> 01:11:03,409
(attendees laughing)

1910
01:11:03,409 --> 01:11:04,242
Hi.

1911
01:11:04,242 --> 01:11:05,424
Let's do it, while I'm signing.

1912
01:11:05,424 --> 01:11:06,297
What's your question, Katie?

1913
01:11:06,297 --> 01:11:08,368
- Hi Gary, I'm Katie Richardson

1914
01:11:08,368 --> 01:11:10,235
and I was first introduced to you

1915
01:11:10,235 --> 01:11:11,810
as I was trying to go to bed at night

1916
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:13,229
and my husband's got his phone on

1917
01:11:13,229 --> 01:11:16,960
and I'm hearing this
guy make a rant in a cab

1918
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,999
throwing f-bombs every other word.

1919
01:11:18,999 --> 01:11:21,034
I'm like what the heck is this?

1920
01:11:21,034 --> 01:11:23,705
And turns out you speak tons of truth

1921
01:11:23,705 --> 01:11:27,478
and so you have won
over this mother of four

1922
01:11:27,478 --> 01:11:30,136
who's a business owner, and I love it,

1923
01:11:30,136 --> 01:11:33,745
and so that's part of what
my question to you is,

1924
01:11:33,745 --> 01:11:37,724
is like you own who
you are and I love that

1925
01:11:37,724 --> 01:11:39,850
and like that's what people
are so attracted to, right?

1926
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:40,683
- [Gary] A hundred percent.

1927
01:11:40,683 --> 01:11:41,851
- You're up there being Gary.

1928
01:11:41,851 --> 01:11:45,003
At what point, like you talked about how

1929
01:11:45,003 --> 01:11:46,872
you worked with your dad

1930
01:11:46,872 --> 01:11:48,122
and it was a three million-dollar company

1931
01:11:48,122 --> 01:11:50,181
and then you took it to
10 million after he left.

1932
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:52,964
At what point did you
give yourself permission

1933
01:11:52,964 --> 01:11:55,161
to be you and then realize,

1934
01:11:55,161 --> 01:11:57,742
like tell us that story
about when you are like,

1935
01:11:57,742 --> 01:12:00,442
wow, this is working, people
are connecting with me

1936
01:12:00,442 --> 01:12:03,306
and my way of being and
like what was that like

1937
01:12:03,306 --> 01:12:05,087
when you're like this is working?

1938
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:06,632
- I feel like--
- I'm gonna keep doing this.

1939
01:12:06,632 --> 01:12:08,871
- You know it's funny there's,
thank you first of all.

1940
01:12:08,871 --> 01:12:09,826
There's a lot of things there.

1941
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:13,993
Number one, it is 100%
because of nature-nurture.

1942
01:12:15,723 --> 01:12:16,556
Being an immigrant

1943
01:12:16,556 --> 01:12:17,883
and always having a chip on your shoulder,

1944
01:12:17,883 --> 01:12:20,319
you're always an outcast to
begin with at some level.

1945
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:22,187
And I was a Russian immigrant,

1946
01:12:22,187 --> 01:12:24,966
which was our major
enemy when I was a kid,

1947
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:26,169
so I had some weird shit going on

1948
01:12:26,169 --> 01:12:27,948
that I don't tell a whole lot

1949
01:12:27,948 --> 01:12:29,577
'cause it's not as relevant these days,

1950
01:12:29,577 --> 01:12:30,519
but there's a lot of parallels

1951
01:12:30,519 --> 01:12:32,098
to whoever the bad guys are now.

1952
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:34,627
I was the bad guy, it was
kinda weird for a little while.

1953
01:12:34,627 --> 01:12:38,703
Number two, my mom became a mom blindly.

1954
01:12:38,703 --> 01:12:42,355
I remember walking sophomore
year in high school,

1955
01:12:42,355 --> 01:12:43,512
no freshman year in high school.

1956
01:12:43,512 --> 01:12:45,762
I'm 4'11", my freshman
year in high school.

1957
01:12:45,762 --> 01:12:47,466
I spurted it in sophomore year.

1958
01:12:47,466 --> 01:12:50,083
I have the worst fuckin' mullet

1959
01:12:50,083 --> 01:12:52,860
you've ever seen in your life.

1960
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:54,694
I've got a backpack that I'm rolling with

1961
01:12:54,694 --> 01:12:56,523
that's bigger than me.

1962
01:12:56,523 --> 01:12:59,640
And I'm walking down the hall and I go,

1963
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:02,183
I remember this vividly,
I'm like wait a minute,

1964
01:13:02,183 --> 01:13:06,350
I'm not the best-looking,
awesomest dude in the world?

1965
01:13:07,528 --> 01:13:09,842
Like my mom had me so brainwashed.

1966
01:13:09,842 --> 01:13:10,964
(attendees laughing)

1967
01:13:10,964 --> 01:13:14,812
I'm being serious, on
straight positivity that like,

1968
01:13:14,812 --> 01:13:15,888
that never went away.

1969
01:13:15,888 --> 01:13:18,865
Like my mom, if I opened
the door for a woman,

1970
01:13:18,865 --> 01:13:21,771
like my mom was super smart
and I'm doing the same thing.

1971
01:13:21,771 --> 01:13:24,094
She would make, if I opened the door.

1972
01:13:24,094 --> 01:13:25,672
This is a true story, Katie.

1973
01:13:25,672 --> 01:13:30,052
I opened the door for a woman
when I was nine at McDonald's.

1974
01:13:30,052 --> 01:13:31,926
That's the story.

1975
01:13:31,926 --> 01:13:34,174
I went to McDonald's, woman was coming

1976
01:13:34,174 --> 01:13:35,459
and I held the door open for her.

1977
01:13:35,459 --> 01:13:39,079
My mom reacted as if I won
the fuckin' Nobel Peace Prize.

1978
01:13:39,079 --> 01:13:40,522
(attendees laughing)

1979
01:13:40,522 --> 01:13:42,960
And she did that about
all the shit that matters,

1980
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,899
which is what makes me who I am today.

1981
01:13:44,899 --> 01:13:46,436
Fourth grade, Katie, fourth grade,

1982
01:13:46,436 --> 01:13:49,074
I got an F on a science test.

1983
01:13:49,074 --> 01:13:50,232
I needed to get it signed

1984
01:13:50,232 --> 01:13:51,804
because I guess that's
how they used to do it.

1985
01:13:51,804 --> 01:13:53,175
I don't know if they still do that shit.

1986
01:13:53,175 --> 01:13:55,536
I flushed it down the toilet

1987
01:13:55,536 --> 01:13:57,529
because my dad hadn't gotten to me yet

1988
01:13:57,529 --> 01:14:01,337
and then like I was like,
but I was still a kid

1989
01:14:01,337 --> 01:14:03,173
so my conscience was still around

1990
01:14:03,173 --> 01:14:05,833
and so I just couldn't
sleep and I told my mom,

1991
01:14:05,833 --> 01:14:08,464
and basically three weeks later,

1992
01:14:08,464 --> 01:14:11,079
I was sitting in social
studies, fourth grade

1993
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:12,711
and said fuck this, I'm out.

1994
01:14:12,711 --> 01:14:15,524
And from that day on, I
decided to fail every class,

1995
01:14:15,524 --> 01:14:18,846
work on my business skills
and become who I'm gonna be.

1996
01:14:18,846 --> 01:14:20,431
- I love it!

1997
01:14:20,431 --> 01:14:21,264
Thank you.

1998
01:14:21,264 --> 01:14:23,340
- [Gary] You're welcome

1999
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:25,584
(attendees applauds)

2000
01:14:25,584 --> 01:14:26,736
- [Bret] Right, it's my second time.

2001
01:14:26,736 --> 01:14:27,964
- [Katie] Hey, Gary.

2002
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,131
Sorry.

2003
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:29,964
- Sorry, Brett.

2004
01:14:29,964 --> 01:14:31,564
- I just had to quick ask.

2005
01:14:31,564 --> 01:14:33,394
I make amazing baby products

2006
01:14:33,394 --> 01:14:35,530
and I don't know if you're
still having babies or not.

2007
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:36,363
- [Gary] No.

2008
01:14:36,363 --> 01:14:40,358
- But if you need like the
awesomest baby gift for a friend,

2009
01:14:40,358 --> 01:14:42,685
come to me, and my company's
called Pudge, like baby Pudge.

2010
01:14:42,685 --> 01:14:44,481
- [Gary] Send me an email
to gary@vaynermedia.

2011
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:45,314
- Okay.

2012
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:48,396
- In the title, write our entire story.

2013
01:14:48,396 --> 01:14:49,481
I was the one with the four kids,

2014
01:14:49,481 --> 01:14:51,525
the husband in the bed and you won me over

2015
01:14:51,525 --> 01:14:53,923
and the Pudge and this, all of it.

2016
01:14:53,923 --> 01:14:54,882
- [Katie] Awesome.

2017
01:14:54,882 --> 01:14:55,715
- And then we'll interact.

2018
01:14:55,715 --> 01:14:58,508
- Yeah, I'll make you look
amazing as a gift-giver.

2019
01:14:58,508 --> 01:14:59,881
- Thank you.

2020
01:14:59,881 --> 01:15:01,383
- [Katie] You're welcome.

2021
01:15:01,383 --> 01:15:02,216
- Bret?

2022
01:15:02,216 --> 01:15:04,216
- I was gonna say it's my
second time seeing you,

2023
01:15:04,216 --> 01:15:05,959
and it's funny how a different energy

2024
01:15:05,959 --> 01:15:06,896
of different audiences.

2025
01:15:06,896 --> 01:15:08,285
Like, the first time I went,

2026
01:15:08,285 --> 01:15:10,277
you were like you even told the audience,

2027
01:15:10,277 --> 01:15:11,767
I am not excited to be here.

2028
01:15:11,767 --> 01:15:14,167
I looked at your stuff, it sucks

2029
01:15:14,167 --> 01:15:16,521
and the lady had been like
talking about coaching

2030
01:15:16,521 --> 01:15:17,968
the whole time then you're like,

2031
01:15:17,968 --> 01:15:19,696
don't do it just do stuff.

2032
01:15:19,696 --> 01:15:22,220
Anyways it was awesome, it was in Provo.

2033
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:23,216
It was just a couple
of months ago in Provo,

2034
01:15:23,216 --> 01:15:24,493
but it was funny.

2035
01:15:24,493 --> 01:15:26,861
But anyways, quick side question

2036
01:15:26,861 --> 01:15:29,355
is like do you sense
different energy in audiences?

2037
01:15:29,355 --> 01:15:30,188
- [Gary] Hundred percent.

2038
01:15:30,188 --> 01:15:32,684
- [Bret] Okay, because it's
like, it's the same person--

2039
01:15:32,684 --> 01:15:37,161
- I have my religions and my
beliefs, then I have my craft,

2040
01:15:37,161 --> 01:15:39,691
so I'm doing everything
state of the art, right?

2041
01:15:39,691 --> 01:15:42,467
So I have my thesises then I have my work.

2042
01:15:42,467 --> 01:15:43,417
I was in Seattle yesterday

2043
01:15:43,417 --> 01:15:45,862
I spent nine hours, understand
the voice space, love it,

2044
01:15:45,862 --> 01:15:47,800
my craft, my craft.

2045
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,282
So I have my thesises
Bret, I have my craft.

2046
01:15:50,282 --> 01:15:52,559
The reason I'm doing well in speaking

2047
01:15:52,559 --> 01:15:55,081
is I take my thesises, I take my craft

2048
01:15:55,081 --> 01:15:57,360
which sometimes has some nuances
that are valuable, right?

2049
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,303
Usually always ahead of the market

2050
01:15:59,303 --> 01:16:02,648
and then I reverse engineer
the actual audience.

2051
01:16:02,648 --> 01:16:04,892
I reverse engineer the audience.

2052
01:16:04,892 --> 01:16:06,859
Like I give a lot of thought

2053
01:16:06,859 --> 01:16:08,892
and speak to the people that organize.

2054
01:16:08,892 --> 01:16:10,198
Who are you?

2055
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:13,045
Where are you in your funnel of life?

2056
01:16:13,045 --> 01:16:15,352
And like what can I
bring to the most general

2057
01:16:15,352 --> 01:16:17,170
and how quick can I get to Q and A?

2058
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:19,244
So that whatever I miss in the general,

2059
01:16:19,244 --> 01:16:21,810
we can get to in the details.

2060
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:22,767
- [Bret] I totally agree

2061
01:16:22,767 --> 01:16:24,000
because it's just a different energy

2062
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,421
that I feel this time versus last time.

2063
01:16:26,421 --> 01:16:27,368
But my big question is.

2064
01:16:27,368 --> 01:16:28,650
- Please.
- When you think of like,

2065
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:30,750
LaVar Ball or Kim Kardashian

2066
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:32,570
or even Donald Trump for that matter,

2067
01:16:32,570 --> 01:16:33,651
- [Gary] Hacking culture.

2068
01:16:33,651 --> 01:16:34,642
- [Bret] Yeah, like what are your thoughts

2069
01:16:34,642 --> 01:16:37,739
on them and like, is that
the kind of fame you want?

2070
01:16:37,739 --> 01:16:38,921
Or is that the, I mean,
you talked about fame

2071
01:16:38,921 --> 01:16:39,923
being the biggest arbitrage,

2072
01:16:39,923 --> 01:16:42,177
what are your thoughts
on those kind of people?

2073
01:16:42,177 --> 01:16:44,531
- So there's a really interesting
thing that I believe in,

2074
01:16:44,531 --> 01:16:46,311
which is until you know somebody,

2075
01:16:46,311 --> 01:16:47,313
you don't know somebody, right?

2076
01:16:47,313 --> 01:16:48,600
And so like look.

2077
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,493
I mean, getting political never works

2078
01:16:51,493 --> 01:16:54,213
but like, you know, Trump's
got his shtick, right?

2079
01:16:54,213 --> 01:16:58,380
And like he won on my thesis
for the last 10 years, right?

2080
01:16:59,427 --> 01:17:02,695
Kim Kardashian literally is like,

2081
01:17:02,695 --> 01:17:05,867
we are all living in reality TV.

2082
01:17:05,867 --> 01:17:07,522
People shit on reality TV in Hollywood

2083
01:17:07,522 --> 01:17:08,640
then they shit on influencers.

2084
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:11,248
They're all gonna pay
because if you're not abiding

2085
01:17:11,248 --> 01:17:13,554
to what the consumer wants,
you will always lose.

2086
01:17:13,554 --> 01:17:16,200
It doesn't matter what you
want on your ivory tower,

2087
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:19,450
it matters what the world is consuming.

2088
01:17:20,364 --> 01:17:22,681
But I don't, to be very, very, very frank,

2089
01:17:22,681 --> 01:17:25,126
I don't think about it a whole lot, right?

2090
01:17:25,126 --> 01:17:26,742
I know why they're winning.

2091
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:28,159
They were native.

2092
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:33,916
DJ Khaled is an unbelievably
important case study

2093
01:17:33,916 --> 01:17:36,523
in the in the last 10 years
and the next 10 years.

2094
01:17:36,523 --> 01:17:39,214
His personality was native to a platform

2095
01:17:39,214 --> 01:17:41,359
at the right time in the right moment

2096
01:17:41,359 --> 01:17:45,526
and he disproportionately
changed his career on that back.

2097
01:17:47,274 --> 01:17:50,827
Kim Kardashian and Donald
Trump navigated reality TV

2098
01:17:50,827 --> 01:17:53,397
when reality TV was what social media

2099
01:17:53,397 --> 01:17:55,178
has been for last 4 years.

2100
01:17:55,178 --> 01:17:57,284
Somebody in here's gonna get inspired

2101
01:17:57,284 --> 01:18:00,388
and make a voice application
for their business

2102
01:18:00,388 --> 01:18:03,441
that will be that for when voice is here

2103
01:18:03,441 --> 01:18:07,608
in two years for the next
six years, from 2020 to 2026.

2104
01:18:08,738 --> 01:18:11,261
It's literally the same
game over and over, Bret.

2105
01:18:11,261 --> 01:18:14,761
So what I want, listen, fame and exposure,

2106
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:20,005
it doesn't change you,
it exposes who you are.

2107
01:18:20,005 --> 01:18:22,440
So I don't know how you
personally judge those three

2108
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:25,625
and everybody here judges
those three differently.

2109
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:27,825
I just wanna be known for
what I am and who I am

2110
01:18:27,825 --> 01:18:29,639
and how I roll.

2111
01:18:29,639 --> 01:18:30,472
- [Bret] Appreciate that, thank you.

2112
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:31,555
- You got it.

2113
01:18:32,763 --> 01:18:33,754
- Hey, Gary.
- Hey.

2114
01:18:33,754 --> 01:18:35,991
Hey Rach.
- Hi Gary, how are you?

2115
01:18:35,991 --> 01:18:38,097
I'm here with my amazing husband, Josh

2116
01:18:38,097 --> 01:18:41,384
who is like my backbone and
amazing business partner.

2117
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:43,115
I'm a little googly talking to you

2118
01:18:43,115 --> 01:18:45,767
because I remember meeting
Justin Timberlake when I was 14,

2119
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:47,703
but you're like my 32
year-old Backstreet Boy.

2120
01:18:47,703 --> 01:18:49,888
(attendees laughing)

2121
01:18:49,888 --> 01:18:50,794
- He was in NSYNC.

2122
01:18:50,794 --> 01:18:54,342
- Oh yeah, I love them
all, but I love you more.

2123
01:18:54,342 --> 01:18:55,376
For the past seven years,

2124
01:18:55,376 --> 01:18:57,856
you've given me the ability
to be really authentic.

2125
01:18:57,856 --> 01:19:00,294
I'm in a niche where
it's very club promoting,

2126
01:19:00,294 --> 01:19:01,656
it's network marketing.

2127
01:19:01,656 --> 01:19:02,489
- [Gary] Yep.

2128
01:19:02,489 --> 01:19:04,014
- So I basically, for
the last seven years,

2129
01:19:04,014 --> 01:19:06,123
have sold my soul to
direct selling companies

2130
01:19:06,123 --> 01:19:07,316
and they made a lot of money

2131
01:19:07,316 --> 01:19:11,418
and have built an incredible
following of network marketers

2132
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:12,703
and direct sellers.

2133
01:19:12,703 --> 01:19:16,094
And now that I built a
great team that's passive

2134
01:19:16,094 --> 01:19:18,283
and I serve them and I love them

2135
01:19:18,283 --> 01:19:22,507
but I really wanna branch out
into more mainstream impact,

2136
01:19:22,507 --> 01:19:24,362
primarily to female entrepreneurs.

2137
01:19:24,362 --> 01:19:26,928
And I wanna know what's
your recommendation

2138
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:29,909
for somebody like me
who's had this huge niche,

2139
01:19:29,909 --> 01:19:32,265
they all expect me to be
the prospector, the closer,

2140
01:19:32,265 --> 01:19:34,208
of the lead generator, the team builder.

2141
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:37,416
Just now to say all right,
I'm someone new, transition.

2142
01:19:37,416 --> 01:19:41,362
- If we had coffee, I'm
gonna give you the 90% answer

2143
01:19:41,362 --> 01:19:43,058
because there's 10% that's too personal

2144
01:19:43,058 --> 01:19:45,141
I don't wanna do it here.

2145
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:49,704
I have to figure out how
mainstream you wanna be.

2146
01:19:49,704 --> 01:19:50,985
- [Rach] I'll buy you coffee.

2147
01:19:50,985 --> 01:19:51,818
- I'm sure.

2148
01:19:51,818 --> 01:19:54,837
(attendees laughing)

2149
01:19:54,837 --> 01:19:55,670
- Everyday.

2150
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:57,526
- I don't know how
mainstream you wanna be.

2151
01:19:57,526 --> 01:19:59,593
So like if you want to be mainstream

2152
01:19:59,593 --> 01:20:02,737
like the cover of Forbes
and like mainstream,

2153
01:20:02,737 --> 01:20:04,639
like all the way mainstream,

2154
01:20:04,639 --> 01:20:06,916
you'll have to give up network marketing.

2155
01:20:06,916 --> 01:20:07,833
Completely.

2156
01:20:09,736 --> 01:20:10,644
That's it.
- Yeah.

2157
01:20:10,644 --> 01:20:13,064
And I have no problem with
whatever God has for me.

2158
01:20:13,064 --> 01:20:14,716
I just would know if there's any advice.

2159
01:20:14,716 --> 01:20:17,898
- I mean it's a stunningly
binary answer, Rach.

2160
01:20:17,898 --> 01:20:18,852
- [Rach] Correct.

2161
01:20:18,852 --> 01:20:22,821
- If you want to go mainstream,
you have to give it up,

2162
01:20:22,821 --> 01:20:24,179
because it is not mainstream.
- Because of the stigma.

2163
01:20:24,179 --> 01:20:25,133
- What's that?

2164
01:20:25,133 --> 01:20:26,002
- Because of the stigma.

2165
01:20:26,002 --> 01:20:27,031
- [Gary] 100%

2166
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:27,864
- Yeah and then my last question--

2167
01:20:27,864 --> 01:20:29,678
- And the math around how
many people make money

2168
01:20:29,678 --> 01:20:30,757
and how many don't.

2169
01:20:30,757 --> 01:20:32,003
- Correct.

2170
01:20:32,003 --> 01:20:35,073
My last question is there
any trends that you see

2171
01:20:35,073 --> 01:20:37,148
or platforms or any advice that you see

2172
01:20:37,148 --> 01:20:41,188
with women entrepreneurs
primarily my age 30s, 40s?

2173
01:20:41,188 --> 01:20:44,900
- Yeah, so the thing you know
it's funny, Katie, right?

2174
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:45,733
Hey.

2175
01:20:46,936 --> 01:20:47,769
Hi.

2176
01:20:48,964 --> 01:20:50,288
Katie said the most important part,

2177
01:20:50,288 --> 01:20:52,858
I've become unbelievably fascinated

2178
01:20:52,858 --> 01:20:56,546
and empathetic about the
difference between men and women.

2179
01:20:56,546 --> 01:20:58,451
You know I'm super fascinated by it

2180
01:20:58,451 --> 01:20:59,317
from a business standpoint.

2181
01:20:59,317 --> 01:21:01,095
That's my lens to the world.

2182
01:21:01,095 --> 01:21:04,095
It's harder to be 100% yourself

2183
01:21:04,944 --> 01:21:06,598
when you're a woman, than a man.

2184
01:21:06,598 --> 01:21:11,395
I genuinely believe that because
men are dick faces, right?

2185
01:21:11,395 --> 01:21:13,996
And so the answer to your question

2186
01:21:13,996 --> 01:21:17,913
is to be 100% radically transparently you.

2187
01:21:19,656 --> 01:21:21,478
I'm also massively empathetic

2188
01:21:21,478 --> 01:21:23,516
how that's difficult for everybody

2189
01:21:23,516 --> 01:21:25,849
especially attractive women.

2190
01:21:27,330 --> 01:21:28,163
But that's the answer.

2191
01:21:28,163 --> 01:21:28,996
- Thank you.

2192
01:21:28,996 --> 01:21:30,747
- You got it.

2193
01:21:30,747 --> 01:21:32,232
- What's up?
- What's up, man?

2194
01:21:32,232 --> 01:21:33,065
Good to see you.
- So.

2195
01:21:33,065 --> 01:21:33,898
- How you been?

2196
01:21:33,898 --> 01:21:34,731
- [Curtis] I've been good, man.

2197
01:21:34,731 --> 01:21:35,564
- Good, man, it's good to see you.

2198
01:21:35,564 --> 01:21:37,672
- So, four years ago, I was couch surfing

2199
01:21:37,672 --> 01:21:42,189
and living out of my car and
I sat in a room with Gary

2200
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:46,743
and 13 other kids and
Gary told us that this app

2201
01:21:46,743 --> 01:21:49,147
was gonna change our lives forever.

2202
01:21:49,147 --> 01:21:53,314
And it did and Gary was such
a positive change on my life.

2203
01:21:54,739 --> 01:21:58,173
Now unfortunately they
deleted the app, what do I do?

2204
01:21:58,173 --> 01:22:00,126
(laughing)

2205
01:22:00,126 --> 01:22:01,209
- Yeah, fuck.

2206
01:22:02,318 --> 01:22:04,180
That's amazing.

2207
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:07,404
- Actually I just wanted
to make that joke but--

2208
01:22:07,404 --> 01:22:08,973
- I knew.
- But what do you?

2209
01:22:08,973 --> 01:22:11,124
But the real question,
real question for you.

2210
01:22:11,124 --> 01:22:12,778
When you run into your failures

2211
01:22:12,778 --> 01:22:14,516
and you feel like you're
at your rock bottom,

2212
01:22:14,516 --> 01:22:15,798
what's your next move?

2213
01:22:15,798 --> 01:22:19,264
'Cause I'm always trying
to reinvent myself

2214
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:21,161
and I'll do things that work

2215
01:22:21,161 --> 01:22:22,193
and then I'll do things that don't work.

2216
01:22:22,193 --> 01:22:24,313
- Curtis, you and some of the friends,

2217
01:22:24,313 --> 01:22:26,295
you guys have a big advantage

2218
01:22:26,295 --> 01:22:28,735
and all of you have gone
a little bit different

2219
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:30,021
with that transition of mine

2220
01:22:30,021 --> 01:22:32,006
and what happened on
Snapchat and Instagram

2221
01:22:32,006 --> 01:22:32,875
and things of that nature,

2222
01:22:32,875 --> 01:22:34,318
but you have something very special.

2223
01:22:34,318 --> 01:22:36,519
First of all you have talent, right?

2224
01:22:36,519 --> 01:22:39,452
Second of all, you've
once tasted what it's like

2225
01:22:39,452 --> 01:22:42,100
to buy beachfront property in Malibu.

2226
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:44,368
- No I live in an apartment, still.

2227
01:22:44,368 --> 01:22:45,201
But yeah, that'd be nice.

2228
01:22:45,201 --> 01:22:46,034
- [Gary] But know what I mean?

2229
01:22:46,034 --> 01:22:46,867
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2230
01:22:46,867 --> 01:22:48,538
- AKA, you knew what
it meant to your career

2231
01:22:48,538 --> 01:22:50,029
by being one of the first 40 people

2232
01:22:50,029 --> 01:22:53,081
that mattered on a platform
that became huge, right?

2233
01:22:53,081 --> 01:22:54,318
Instead of trying to,

2234
01:22:54,318 --> 01:22:56,270
what you and others that have.

2235
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:57,263
By the way, you know why,

2236
01:22:57,263 --> 01:22:59,455
I wish you could see the
goosebumps I have right now.

2237
01:22:59,455 --> 01:23:00,488
It happened to me.

2238
01:23:00,488 --> 01:23:04,655
I won Twitter and then I
wasn't at the top of stuff

2239
01:23:07,726 --> 01:23:10,587
like I was in that 2006,
seven and eight world,

2240
01:23:10,587 --> 01:23:11,701
you know, right?

2241
01:23:11,701 --> 01:23:12,899
Why do you think the Vine thing,

2242
01:23:12,899 --> 01:23:14,123
and this is where I'm going with this.

2243
01:23:14,123 --> 01:23:15,990
Basically if you choose to,

2244
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:16,989
it's gonna happen again.

2245
01:23:16,989 --> 01:23:17,942
And let me explain why.

2246
01:23:17,942 --> 01:23:20,428
The reason I got you guys all together

2247
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:22,955
and I flew to L.A. and met
with others of you, like,

2248
01:23:22,955 --> 01:23:25,100
the reason I did that was
it was black and white.

2249
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:28,575
I'm like I fuckin' seen
this show before, right?

2250
01:23:28,575 --> 01:23:29,600
- Yeah, you said that.

2251
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,627
You actually said that.

2252
01:23:30,627 --> 01:23:31,460
You were like saying.

2253
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:32,791
this is the new YouTube
and blah blah blah.

2254
01:23:32,791 --> 01:23:33,908
- [Gary] It just was so black and white.

2255
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:34,741
- Yeah, I remember.

2256
01:23:34,741 --> 01:23:35,938
- And obviously, it took different tacks

2257
01:23:35,938 --> 01:23:38,010
and the ones that kind of
tripled down on Instagram

2258
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:40,622
had what happened but you,

2259
01:23:40,622 --> 01:23:44,220
instead of trying to
catch up to what's now,

2260
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:46,868
I give you the recommendation
that I took myself

2261
01:23:46,868 --> 01:23:49,300
because I tend to only give
advice that I've actually done,

2262
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:50,530
'cause it just feels better.

2263
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:54,697
You gotta either hibernate,
make do, grind through

2264
01:23:56,078 --> 01:23:59,261
and spend all your time
looking for that next one.

2265
01:23:59,261 --> 01:24:02,935
That is one, you should
be downloading, you, you,

2266
01:24:02,935 --> 01:24:04,260
should be downloading, you.

2267
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:07,309
You should be downloading a top 100 app

2268
01:24:07,309 --> 01:24:10,961
in the Apple Store that is
social or consumer facing

2269
01:24:10,961 --> 01:24:13,812
every day of your life,
creating an account

2270
01:24:13,812 --> 01:24:16,770
and producing the first piece of content.

2271
01:24:16,770 --> 01:24:17,760
- [Curtis] Okay I'm gonna do that.

2272
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:18,593
- Awesome.

2273
01:24:18,593 --> 01:24:19,426
- [Curtis] Thanks, Gary.

2274
01:24:19,426 --> 01:24:21,176
- You got it brother.

2275
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:24,728
- [Man] Fellow 4'11" freshman, here.

2276
01:24:24,728 --> 01:24:25,679
- I love it.

2277
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:27,646
- Really quick question,
maybe a little personal.

2278
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:28,890
You know we have this engine.

2279
01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:30,384
All of us in this room have this engine,

2280
01:24:30,384 --> 01:24:32,654
we have a hard time shutting off.

2281
01:24:32,654 --> 01:24:34,058
It's what makes us successful.

2282
01:24:34,058 --> 01:24:37,577
How do you balance work and family?

2283
01:24:37,577 --> 01:24:39,357
How do you do it?

2284
01:24:39,357 --> 01:24:40,964
- By first and foremost,

2285
01:24:40,964 --> 01:24:44,320
not adhering to the current
state of political correctness

2286
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:49,011
that everybody here has deployed
on me, most of all, right?

2287
01:24:49,011 --> 01:24:51,219
And second, extremism.

2288
01:24:51,219 --> 01:24:54,025
I almost took the whole
entire month of August off,

2289
01:24:54,025 --> 01:24:56,419
like I go all in, right?

2290
01:24:56,419 --> 01:24:58,020
I go when I'm in this like.

2291
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:58,853
Monday through Friday,

2292
01:24:58,853 --> 01:25:02,955
I do not see my kids pretty much at all.

2293
01:25:02,955 --> 01:25:05,885
39 weeks of the 52 weeks in the year,

2294
01:25:05,885 --> 01:25:07,454
it's just what it is.

2295
01:25:07,454 --> 01:25:08,616
And then on weekends,

2296
01:25:08,616 --> 01:25:12,020
and you know seven weeks,
eight weeks of vacation a year,

2297
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:13,513
I'm all in the other way.

2298
01:25:13,513 --> 01:25:14,508
That's how I do it.

2299
01:25:14,508 --> 01:25:15,422
For me.

2300
01:25:15,422 --> 01:25:17,526
But that is only uniquely gonna work

2301
01:25:17,526 --> 01:25:21,661
if me and my partner in crime
are aligned on that strategy,

2302
01:25:21,661 --> 01:25:23,110
audit that strategy everyday.

2303
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:24,768
By the way, I don't even
want to do it anymore.

2304
01:25:24,768 --> 01:25:27,332
As now, they're eight and
five and not five and two.

2305
01:25:27,332 --> 01:25:29,887
They're just more
interesting to be around.

2306
01:25:29,887 --> 01:25:30,720
(attendees laughing)

2307
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:33,220
You know, so like for example,

2308
01:25:35,168 --> 01:25:38,057
I guarantee you, in 24 more months,

2309
01:25:38,057 --> 01:25:41,620
this exact trip, they're
here and we go to,

2310
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:44,100
we go and see the Grand
Canyon or something, you know?

2311
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:48,267
So like, I'm so sad that so
many people do certain things

2312
01:25:51,215 --> 01:25:54,199
in parenting because that's
what the other parents

2313
01:25:54,199 --> 01:25:55,983
think they should be doing.

2314
01:25:55,983 --> 01:25:58,044
Like, I don't know.

2315
01:25:58,044 --> 01:26:00,736
Like, I just wanna make a
very important statement

2316
01:26:00,736 --> 01:26:03,913
that I implore every parent
in this room understands.

2317
01:26:03,913 --> 01:26:07,056
Everything that is right
in parenting right now

2318
01:26:07,056 --> 01:26:11,767
by the common standards,
will not be in 20 years.

2319
01:26:11,767 --> 01:26:14,789
You're gonna be judged
one way or the other.

2320
01:26:14,789 --> 01:26:16,406
So.

2321
01:26:16,406 --> 01:26:17,239
- [Man] Thanks.

2322
01:26:17,239 --> 01:26:18,683
- You got it brother.

2323
01:26:18,683 --> 01:26:19,970
- [Alex] Gary, over here.

2324
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:20,803
- Oh, sorry.

2325
01:26:20,803 --> 01:26:21,636
Hey Alex.

2326
01:26:21,636 --> 01:26:22,469
- [Alex] Hey how are you?

2327
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:23,302
- Good.

2328
01:26:23,302 --> 01:26:24,159
- Fellow 42 year-old.

2329
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:26,134
I think your mom and my
mom should hang out, bro

2330
01:26:26,134 --> 01:26:26,967
'cause I think--

2331
01:26:26,967 --> 01:26:27,800
- [Gary] Similar stuff?

2332
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:28,962
She sounds amazing.

2333
01:26:28,962 --> 01:26:30,701
- And then, just wanna let you know,

2334
01:26:30,701 --> 01:26:33,301
like validation on the sound, totally true

2335
01:26:33,301 --> 01:26:34,792
'cause I like literally take a shower

2336
01:26:34,792 --> 01:26:36,111
with you every morning, so.

2337
01:26:36,111 --> 01:26:36,944
- [Gary] Thanks brother.

2338
01:26:36,944 --> 01:26:38,046
- I do, I just play it

2339
01:26:38,046 --> 01:26:38,904
I got a little shower thing.
- I get it.

2340
01:26:38,904 --> 01:26:40,147
- I listen to your audio.

2341
01:26:40,147 --> 01:26:40,980
- [Gary] I get it.

2342
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:42,177
- Gets me going so thank you.

2343
01:26:42,177 --> 01:26:43,584
- That visual is fuckin' awesome.

2344
01:26:43,584 --> 01:26:45,906
(attendees laughing)

2345
01:26:45,906 --> 01:26:47,298
- I didn't even think about
you seeing the visual,

2346
01:26:47,298 --> 01:26:48,699
but now that I think about it, yeah.

2347
01:26:48,699 --> 01:26:50,844
That could've gotten off way, thank you.

2348
01:26:50,844 --> 01:26:52,496
So I got a two-part question for you.

2349
01:26:52,496 --> 01:26:54,064
One is on culture.

2350
01:26:54,064 --> 01:26:56,814
So our company has grown and now,

2351
01:26:58,118 --> 01:27:00,805
we're we're doing pretty well and I'm,

2352
01:27:00,805 --> 01:27:02,173
you've been to like nine figures

2353
01:27:02,173 --> 01:27:03,826
and that's where we wanna go, right?

2354
01:27:03,826 --> 01:27:05,718
So my first question is okay,

2355
01:27:05,718 --> 01:27:09,150
from a culture standpoint,
when you grow rapidly,

2356
01:27:09,150 --> 01:27:11,332
how do you embed the culture

2357
01:27:11,332 --> 01:27:13,931
to make sure that it grows
with the right people, right?

2358
01:27:13,931 --> 01:27:14,764
So we built values manifestos--

2359
01:27:14,764 --> 01:27:16,766
- Ready, ready, ready?

2360
01:27:16,766 --> 01:27:17,677
- [Alex] Yeah.

2361
01:27:17,677 --> 01:27:21,260
- How do you get muscles
by doing push-ups?

2362
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:26,087
- You do it consistently every day.

2363
01:27:26,087 --> 01:27:30,221
- I spend an ungodly
amount of my time on HR.

2364
01:27:30,221 --> 01:27:33,117
Like now, I have 800 employees.

2365
01:27:33,117 --> 01:27:35,144
The biggest thing I'm working on for 2018,

2366
01:27:35,144 --> 01:27:39,028
so I have an open door policy,
which is not working for me.

2367
01:27:39,028 --> 01:27:41,144
It's real open door,
like the key big thing

2368
01:27:41,144 --> 01:27:44,366
for my two admins and assistants
is when an employee asks,

2369
01:27:44,366 --> 01:27:45,357
they get booked.

2370
01:27:45,357 --> 01:27:48,587
Whoever, first day, nine years, done.

2371
01:27:48,587 --> 01:27:49,456
Not working.

2372
01:27:49,456 --> 01:27:51,148
They think I'm fancy and Gary Vee,

2373
01:27:51,148 --> 01:27:54,504
they're scared, nobody wants
to really talk to their CEO,

2374
01:27:54,504 --> 01:27:57,489
so next year, I'm gonna mandate

2375
01:27:57,489 --> 01:27:59,806
that I see every one of my
employees every six months

2376
01:27:59,806 --> 01:28:00,836
for 15 minutes.

2377
01:28:00,836 --> 01:28:04,382
Which is gonna eat up big amounts of time.

2378
01:28:04,382 --> 01:28:06,946
Culture is the only thing you trade on.

2379
01:28:06,946 --> 01:28:09,903
- So you're gonna see all
800 employees, 15 minutes?

2380
01:28:09,903 --> 01:28:12,322
- [Gary] Yes, twice a year.

2381
01:28:12,322 --> 01:28:15,429
- Okay, so literally am thinking I wanna--

2382
01:28:15,429 --> 01:28:16,262
- The math is daunting.

2383
01:28:16,262 --> 01:28:18,214
- When I do the one-on-one
time, it always works

2384
01:28:18,214 --> 01:28:20,414
but I'm just thinking that
from scaling standpoint,

2385
01:28:20,414 --> 01:28:21,324
like how the heck do I do it?

2386
01:28:21,324 --> 01:28:25,491
- Scaling the unscalable is
how you build long term wealth.

2387
01:28:26,949 --> 01:28:28,231
- Damn dude, that's a good one.

2388
01:28:28,231 --> 01:28:29,064
- Thanks, bro.

2389
01:28:29,064 --> 01:28:30,782
(attendees laughing)

2390
01:28:30,782 --> 01:28:33,304
I didn't get up here from my looks.

2391
01:28:33,304 --> 01:28:36,419
- Now we know why you get
paid to stand up there.

2392
01:28:36,419 --> 01:28:39,177
My second question was okay, as you grow,

2393
01:28:39,177 --> 01:28:41,651
obviously have things you
get you've got haters, right?

2394
01:28:41,651 --> 01:28:43,472
I'm sure that people don't
like you and whatever.

2395
01:28:43,472 --> 01:28:44,305
- [Gary] Sure.

2396
01:28:44,305 --> 01:28:45,792
- So I always focus on
the mission and the vision

2397
01:28:45,792 --> 01:28:47,857
and the people that we're helping, right?

2398
01:28:47,857 --> 01:28:49,218
But when you get like certain people,

2399
01:28:49,218 --> 01:28:50,580
I mean it still affects me,

2400
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:51,818
like my inner self.
- Of course.

2401
01:28:51,818 --> 01:28:54,797
- So how do you overcome
that so you can keep growing?

2402
01:28:54,797 --> 01:28:56,327
- Empathy.

2403
01:28:56,327 --> 01:28:57,160
- [Alex] For them?

2404
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:58,109
- Yes.

2405
01:28:58,109 --> 01:28:59,976
- Like just with their
life circumstances or?

2406
01:28:59,976 --> 01:29:03,983
- Sure, if a human
being can generate hate,

2407
01:29:03,983 --> 01:29:06,714
they're not in a good place.

2408
01:29:06,714 --> 01:29:08,119
- Okay.

2409
01:29:08,119 --> 01:29:12,208
So what do you do mentally and
mindset to just keep going?

2410
01:29:12,208 --> 01:29:15,726
- I deploy gratitude that I'm not them.

2411
01:29:15,726 --> 01:29:17,753
- Okay, got it.

2412
01:29:17,753 --> 01:29:18,706
- [Gary] Thanks man.

2413
01:29:18,706 --> 01:29:19,904
- Thank you.

2414
01:29:19,904 --> 01:29:20,737
- Hey man.

2415
01:29:20,737 --> 01:29:22,070
- [Woman] Hello.

2416
01:29:23,796 --> 01:29:27,108
So I started on Vine as
well doing like comedy.

2417
01:29:27,108 --> 01:29:27,941
- I remember.

2418
01:29:27,941 --> 01:29:30,189
- Yeah, and now I do it on Instagram

2419
01:29:30,189 --> 01:29:32,712
and I grew a large following on there.

2420
01:29:32,712 --> 01:29:33,545
- [Gary] Very large.

2421
01:29:33,545 --> 01:29:38,365
- Yeah and it's still growing
a lot but I wanna be ahead,

2422
01:29:38,365 --> 01:29:41,590
as you say and I know I have
a lot of meetings about VR,

2423
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:44,283
and creating content within VR.

2424
01:29:44,283 --> 01:29:46,726
- I'm a very anti-consumer VR guy

2425
01:29:46,726 --> 01:29:48,893
in the timing that I like.

2426
01:29:50,283 --> 01:29:52,970
So everything for me is 24, 36 months.

2427
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:53,803
- [Woman] Yeah.

2428
01:29:53,803 --> 01:29:54,636
- Right?

2429
01:29:54,636 --> 01:29:57,019
I just don't know how
many people are consuming

2430
01:29:57,019 --> 01:30:01,029
at the scale that you would
be giving up opportunity costs

2431
01:30:01,029 --> 01:30:04,134
in other places in 36 months of VR.

2432
01:30:04,134 --> 01:30:08,301
Until I see even one person
consistently consuming VR

2433
01:30:10,107 --> 01:30:13,169
like an hour a week, like
if I can find one human

2434
01:30:13,169 --> 01:30:16,916
who's not a fuckin' really weird nerd,

2435
01:30:16,916 --> 01:30:18,575
who spends one hour, right?

2436
01:30:18,575 --> 01:30:20,345
So I think the reason you are feeling that

2437
01:30:20,345 --> 01:30:22,616
is you're in the LA bubble.

2438
01:30:22,616 --> 01:30:24,054
Everybody's pumping a ton of money

2439
01:30:24,054 --> 01:30:26,167
from venture capital into VR.

2440
01:30:26,167 --> 01:30:27,000
- [Woman] Yeah, they have budgets.

2441
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,361
- And it's literally, like,

2442
01:30:28,361 --> 01:30:29,689
I mean the thing you should study

2443
01:30:29,689 --> 01:30:33,287
is what happened to the web in '99, 2000.

2444
01:30:33,287 --> 01:30:35,714
You've probably seen it, pets.com,

2445
01:30:35,714 --> 01:30:37,861
all these companies were worth a drillion,

2446
01:30:37,861 --> 01:30:38,980
that's what I feel about VR.

2447
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:40,014
It's coming.

2448
01:30:40,014 --> 01:30:41,462
Amazon's coming, right?

2449
01:30:41,462 --> 01:30:43,898
eBay is coming, but I think for you

2450
01:30:43,898 --> 01:30:46,338
and knowing the arbitrage
that you can trade on,

2451
01:30:46,338 --> 01:30:47,455
I don't believe,

2452
01:30:47,455 --> 01:30:48,989
like if I was talking to you every week,

2453
01:30:48,989 --> 01:30:50,023
I'd be like that's not a good place

2454
01:30:50,023 --> 01:30:51,714
to be spending your energy.

2455
01:30:51,714 --> 01:30:53,038
That's my intuition.

2456
01:30:53,038 --> 01:30:55,314
I do think voice is incredible.

2457
01:30:55,314 --> 01:30:57,057
And then I think for you specifically,

2458
01:30:57,057 --> 01:30:58,428
'cause I know enough from afar.

2459
01:30:58,428 --> 01:30:59,295
We don't know each other super well

2460
01:30:59,295 --> 01:31:01,741
but I know a lot from afar,

2461
01:31:01,741 --> 01:31:02,945
you might wanna think about

2462
01:31:02,945 --> 01:31:05,633
what you wanna put that
energy into, what bucket.

2463
01:31:05,633 --> 01:31:06,748
That's why it's good
that you're here, right?

2464
01:31:06,748 --> 01:31:09,641
What I do think these guys do,

2465
01:31:09,641 --> 01:31:13,567
that's sales and quant,
like or if it's, you know,

2466
01:31:13,567 --> 01:31:16,297
a brand or an event or,

2467
01:31:16,297 --> 01:31:19,784
you're gonna be able to push
that energy towards something.

2468
01:31:19,784 --> 01:31:21,728
You need to take a step
back and get thoughtful

2469
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:24,925
with yourself on like what
other interests you have

2470
01:31:24,925 --> 01:31:27,282
or that that wouldn't come natural

2471
01:31:27,282 --> 01:31:28,644
as the first thing you would think of.

2472
01:31:28,644 --> 01:31:30,026
Like the five or six things you think of.

2473
01:31:30,026 --> 01:31:32,006
Health and wellness and
lifestyle, it's interesting.

2474
01:31:32,006 --> 01:31:33,866
It's probably something subtle,

2475
01:31:33,866 --> 01:31:36,469
putting your energy into
building in that world

2476
01:31:36,469 --> 01:31:38,955
if you wanna really double
down on entrepreneurship,

2477
01:31:38,955 --> 01:31:40,273
is a good idea.

2478
01:31:40,273 --> 01:31:41,557
- [Woman] Okay, cool.

2479
01:31:41,557 --> 01:31:42,390
Thank you.

2480
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:43,223
- You're welcome.

2481
01:31:43,223 --> 01:31:44,056
- [Host] All right guys, we have time

2482
01:31:44,056 --> 01:31:44,889
for only three more questions,

2483
01:31:44,889 --> 01:31:47,639
so we'll go Miles over there
and then we have two here

2484
01:31:47,639 --> 01:31:48,878
and that'll be it.

2485
01:31:48,878 --> 01:31:50,903
- Charles, get up there, we'll do four.

2486
01:31:50,903 --> 01:31:52,390
But you have to stand up.

2487
01:31:52,390 --> 01:31:54,503
I saw your face.

2488
01:31:54,503 --> 01:31:58,814
- Hey Gary, I'm a big fan of mental models

2489
01:31:58,814 --> 01:32:01,375
and ways to kinda overcome challenges.

2490
01:32:01,375 --> 01:32:04,228
And I like understanding
other people's processes.

2491
01:32:04,228 --> 01:32:06,505
So my question to you is

2492
01:32:06,505 --> 01:32:09,271
what is your number one
business challenge right now?

2493
01:32:09,271 --> 01:32:12,492
And what is your process to
come up with that solution?

2494
01:32:12,492 --> 01:32:14,887
- I'm crippled by opportunity,

2495
01:32:14,887 --> 01:32:17,030
is my number one business problem.

2496
01:32:17,030 --> 01:32:19,594
And it's similar to
what I gave over there.

2497
01:32:19,594 --> 01:32:23,177
I'm just attacking it
with blind intuition.

2498
01:32:24,981 --> 01:32:26,921
Every time me and my team try to attack it

2499
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:29,730
from a quant standpoint, it's too foreign,

2500
01:32:29,730 --> 01:32:31,959
it's moving too fast on us.

2501
01:32:31,959 --> 01:32:34,525
And so, that's it man.

2502
01:32:34,525 --> 01:32:36,220
Crippled by opportunity
which is a blessing

2503
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:37,954
and a fuckin' half, as you can imagine,

2504
01:32:37,954 --> 01:32:40,886
but it's the truth, you
know, it's the truth.

2505
01:32:40,886 --> 01:32:44,138
Like do I say yes to a second
season of Planet of the Apps,

2506
01:32:44,138 --> 01:32:47,152
do I like, do I, mean I mean
the Knicks are for sale,

2507
01:32:47,152 --> 01:32:48,767
it's like running through
my mind, you know?

2508
01:32:48,767 --> 01:32:51,280
Like there's a lot going on, man.

2509
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:53,139
I have a lot going on.

2510
01:32:53,139 --> 01:32:56,036
- Right, but I mean other than intuition,

2511
01:32:56,036 --> 01:32:57,938
I mean I got imagine
that there's a bottleneck

2512
01:32:57,938 --> 01:33:01,199
in terms of leverage,
where's that next step?

2513
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:03,392
- My time, yeah I mean.

2514
01:33:03,392 --> 01:33:05,370
Intuitions to solve for the bottleneck

2515
01:33:05,370 --> 01:33:07,644
which is making decisions
in deploying my energies

2516
01:33:07,644 --> 01:33:09,133
against those decisions

2517
01:33:09,133 --> 01:33:12,278
while leaving everything else on the side.

2518
01:33:12,278 --> 01:33:14,533
You know, I decided a year ago,

2519
01:33:14,533 --> 01:33:16,597
I was raising 150 million-dollar fund,

2520
01:33:16,597 --> 01:33:17,623
I gave all the money back.

2521
01:33:17,623 --> 01:33:20,066
It was the biggest
financial loss of my career

2522
01:33:20,066 --> 01:33:22,964
because I hired the staff
and I was gonna pay the staff

2523
01:33:22,964 --> 01:33:24,897
with the 2%, if you know venture,

2524
01:33:24,897 --> 01:33:26,632
of you know the overall fund

2525
01:33:26,632 --> 01:33:29,030
that I was gonna raise $150 million on,

2526
01:33:29,030 --> 01:33:32,056
that's a lot of money, 2%, I
had a pretty expensive staff.

2527
01:33:32,056 --> 01:33:32,889
I was going through the process

2528
01:33:32,889 --> 01:33:34,623
and I'd raised about $80 million

2529
01:33:34,623 --> 01:33:36,734
and one night, I'm
flying home and I'm like,

2530
01:33:36,734 --> 01:33:37,893
I don't believe in this.

2531
01:33:37,893 --> 01:33:40,462
I don't wanna spend this
$150 million in startups.

2532
01:33:40,462 --> 01:33:42,083
I think there's too much
fake shit in the market,

2533
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:43,524
I don't know where to deploy it.

2534
01:33:43,524 --> 01:33:48,239
I think I'm gonna lose it,
and I gave it all back, right?

2535
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:52,297
That's intuition, thought
process, understanding, you know?

2536
01:33:52,297 --> 01:33:54,204
So I'm just doing that everyday.

2537
01:33:54,204 --> 01:33:55,520
- Awesome, thank you.

2538
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:57,187
- [Gary] You got it.

2539
01:33:58,422 --> 01:33:59,376
- [Sabrina] Hello.

2540
01:33:59,376 --> 01:34:00,209
- Hi Sabrina.

2541
01:34:00,209 --> 01:34:01,234
- Big fan.
- Thank you.

2542
01:34:01,234 --> 01:34:03,128
- But my girlfriend is an even bigger fan,

2543
01:34:03,128 --> 01:34:04,947
and I basically couldn't
live down the shame

2544
01:34:04,947 --> 01:34:06,608
of not asking you a question.

2545
01:34:06,608 --> 01:34:07,559
- [Gary] I love it.

2546
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:10,038
- So I'm a social media manager

2547
01:34:10,038 --> 01:34:12,960
and I would just love to
hear about what you think

2548
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,817
is the best campaign you've ever ran

2549
01:34:14,817 --> 01:34:17,734
and why do you qualify it that way?

2550
01:34:19,156 --> 01:34:20,977
- Sour Patch Kids candy.

2551
01:34:20,977 --> 01:34:22,835
We made it a cultural phenomenon,

2552
01:34:22,835 --> 01:34:23,830
because we gave.

2553
01:34:23,830 --> 01:34:26,277
We took all the money from
television commercials

2554
01:34:26,277 --> 01:34:28,941
which go figure, 12 to
15 year olds don't watch

2555
01:34:28,941 --> 01:34:31,681
and we gave it to all the
people that sit at that table

2556
01:34:31,681 --> 01:34:34,624
or the ones that look like them.

2557
01:34:34,624 --> 01:34:36,814
In 4 1/2 years ago, we
took Sour Patch Kids

2558
01:34:36,814 --> 01:34:39,546
marketing budget and put
into Snapchat and Instagram

2559
01:34:39,546 --> 01:34:41,322
when nobody was thinking that way,

2560
01:34:41,322 --> 01:34:44,877
and if anybody has a nine to
17 year-old in their life,

2561
01:34:44,877 --> 01:34:46,960
they eat Sour Patch Kids.

2562
01:34:47,988 --> 01:34:48,821
- [Sabrina] Awesome, thanks so much.

2563
01:34:48,821 --> 01:34:49,654
- You got it.

2564
01:34:49,654 --> 01:34:50,722
And Sabrina, to answer your question,

2565
01:34:50,722 --> 01:34:52,870
the reason I quantify it that way, wasn't.

2566
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:54,478
There's been campaigns that we've done

2567
01:34:54,478 --> 01:34:58,050
that have made more money,
have, you know, gotten,

2568
01:34:58,050 --> 01:35:02,238
excuse me, many more likes
or awareness or more views.

2569
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:03,962
He stands up here and he goes,

2570
01:35:03,962 --> 01:35:05,874
thanks, everybody, we have 100,000 views.

2571
01:35:05,874 --> 01:35:09,440
I already know him
enough to know, yeah and?

2572
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,917
What's happening with those views?

2573
01:35:11,917 --> 01:35:13,612
You know a lot of people in social media,

2574
01:35:13,612 --> 01:35:15,886
they plan vanity metrics, not sales.

2575
01:35:15,886 --> 01:35:17,453
The Sour Patch Kids is the answer

2576
01:35:17,453 --> 01:35:19,273
because we have had
campaigns getting more views.

2577
01:35:19,273 --> 01:35:21,674
This Budweiser, Derek Jeter and Harry,

2578
01:35:21,674 --> 01:35:23,455
the stuff we're doing
for Budweiser's insane.

2579
01:35:23,455 --> 01:35:24,570
We've really crushed sales,

2580
01:35:24,570 --> 01:35:29,203
we're changing a tough brand
in the U.S. but Sour Patch Kids

2581
01:35:29,203 --> 01:35:33,125
became the fastest-growing
candy in 20 years.

2582
01:35:33,125 --> 01:35:35,875
- Thank you so much.
- You got it.

2583
01:35:37,438 --> 01:35:38,967
- [Man] Over here, Gary, real fast.

2584
01:35:38,967 --> 01:35:39,884
- Oh, okay.

2585
01:35:41,414 --> 01:35:42,372
Hey, Linds.

2586
01:35:42,372 --> 01:35:44,573
- Hi, so I'm a course creator

2587
01:35:44,573 --> 01:35:47,552
and I also help entrepreneurs teach better

2588
01:35:47,552 --> 01:35:49,324
so their students get better results.

2589
01:35:49,324 --> 01:35:51,844
I'm a little bit at a crossroads.

2590
01:35:51,844 --> 01:35:55,344
I heard you talking about being in a space

2591
01:35:56,607 --> 01:35:59,344
that's a little overcrowded.
- Saturated.

2592
01:35:59,344 --> 01:36:00,259
- Right?

2593
01:36:00,259 --> 01:36:01,707
And so course creation
is a little that, right?

2594
01:36:01,707 --> 01:36:02,540
- [Gary] Of course.

2595
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:05,546
- I see, though, the chance
to make better teachers,

2596
01:36:05,546 --> 01:36:06,947
to make their products better.

2597
01:36:06,947 --> 01:36:07,780
- [Gary] Good.

2598
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:08,613
- That's one thing.

2599
01:36:08,613 --> 01:36:10,411
And I think I could do really well there.

2600
01:36:10,411 --> 01:36:11,244
- [Gary] Great.

2601
01:36:11,244 --> 01:36:14,377
- But I'm also around the opportunity of,

2602
01:36:14,377 --> 01:36:19,291
I'm a past tenure track
professor and I left academia.

2603
01:36:19,291 --> 01:36:22,399
And as I was leaving,
fellow professors were like,

2604
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:25,216
you figured it out, like go.

2605
01:36:25,216 --> 01:36:27,706
I also feel a calling to help professors

2606
01:36:27,706 --> 01:36:29,151
kind of do what I do.

2607
01:36:29,151 --> 01:36:30,432
- [Gary] You should definitely do that.

2608
01:36:30,432 --> 01:36:31,916
- So that scares the shit out of me.

2609
01:36:31,916 --> 01:36:32,749
- No, no, no.

2610
01:36:32,749 --> 01:36:33,582
I have great news.

2611
01:36:33,582 --> 01:36:35,964
- But this is easier, like
helping entrepreneurs is so easy.

2612
01:36:35,964 --> 01:36:36,916
Okay.

2613
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:38,444
- No shit, Linds.

2614
01:36:38,444 --> 01:36:39,277
- [Linds] I know.

2615
01:36:39,277 --> 01:36:40,704
(attendees laughing)

2616
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:41,717
- But this is back to that Kevin.

2617
01:36:41,717 --> 01:36:43,602
Like you got to decide what you.

2618
01:36:43,602 --> 01:36:45,723
Like by the way, I have
a crazy thing to tell you

2619
01:36:45,723 --> 01:36:47,293
based on something I've been looking at.

2620
01:36:47,293 --> 01:36:48,246
- [Linds] Please tell me.

2621
01:36:48,246 --> 01:36:49,942
- The professors are
about to become easier.

2622
01:36:49,942 --> 01:36:50,893
- [Linds] I know.

2623
01:36:50,893 --> 01:36:52,342
- [Gary] 'Cause they're all
about to go out of business.

2624
01:36:52,342 --> 01:36:54,659
- No, it's a sinking ship
and the ones who know it--

2625
01:36:54,659 --> 01:36:55,570
- Yes, but guess what?

2626
01:36:55,570 --> 01:36:57,227
This is the thing I
wrote about in Crush It!

2627
01:36:57,227 --> 01:36:58,931
I said all these newspapers and magazines

2628
01:36:58,931 --> 01:37:00,213
are in deep shit.

2629
01:37:00,213 --> 01:37:02,573
It's that the writers are
gonna be better, not worse.

2630
01:37:02,573 --> 01:37:03,688
They think there gonna be.

2631
01:37:03,688 --> 01:37:06,084
These professors are about to
get the money they deserve.

2632
01:37:06,084 --> 01:37:07,449
- Yes, and there's brilliant people.

2633
01:37:07,449 --> 01:37:10,426
- Linds, Linds, eat shit for 36 months,

2634
01:37:10,426 --> 01:37:11,293
leave money on the table

2635
01:37:11,293 --> 01:37:12,491
that was easy from the entrepreneurs

2636
01:37:12,491 --> 01:37:14,304
that are never gonna make it
and go help the professors.

2637
01:37:14,304 --> 01:37:16,300
- What's my first move?

2638
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:17,285
- I mean, your first move

2639
01:37:17,285 --> 01:37:18,935
is to build the business structure,

2640
01:37:18,935 --> 01:37:21,045
like what's the business
that you wanna do?

2641
01:37:21,045 --> 01:37:22,574
Do you wanna be TED conferences?

2642
01:37:22,574 --> 01:37:23,407
Do you wanna be a course?

2643
01:37:23,407 --> 01:37:24,807
Do you wanna teach one-on-one?

2644
01:37:24,807 --> 01:37:26,455
Do you wanna sell a product?

2645
01:37:26,455 --> 01:37:28,668
I mean you need to decide what you are.

2646
01:37:28,668 --> 01:37:30,994
- I want to help them
plan an exit strategy

2647
01:37:30,994 --> 01:37:32,777
and to realize that
there's actually money,

2648
01:37:32,777 --> 01:37:33,769
that there's a lot of professors

2649
01:37:33,769 --> 01:37:36,297
that could probably make
courses really good.

2650
01:37:36,297 --> 01:37:37,130
- [Gary] That's what you should do.

2651
01:37:37,130 --> 01:37:38,025
- Yeah, okay.

2652
01:37:38,025 --> 01:37:40,378
- So like charge them
money for your knowledge

2653
01:37:40,378 --> 01:37:41,327
if that's what you wanna do.

2654
01:37:41,327 --> 01:37:42,322
- [Linds] Okay.

2655
01:37:42,322 --> 01:37:43,155
- And you know you can put that

2656
01:37:43,155 --> 01:37:46,710
in seven different buckets, right?

2657
01:37:46,710 --> 01:37:47,543
- [Linds] Thanks.

2658
01:37:47,543 --> 01:37:48,376
- I'm telling you right now,

2659
01:37:48,376 --> 01:37:49,278
you're walking right into the,

2660
01:37:49,278 --> 01:37:52,172
what is going to be an
enormously large space

2661
01:37:52,172 --> 01:37:54,044
and the fact that you were one of them,

2662
01:37:54,044 --> 01:37:57,042
do you know how much I
kill with small businesses?

2663
01:37:57,042 --> 01:37:58,620
Not because it's funny and haha,

2664
01:37:58,620 --> 01:38:00,435
it's 'cause I was one of them.

2665
01:38:00,435 --> 01:38:02,245
- [Linds] Yeah.

2666
01:38:02,245 --> 01:38:03,194
Thank you.

2667
01:38:03,194 --> 01:38:04,611
- You're welcome.

2668
01:38:05,666 --> 01:38:06,499
- Hey Gary, I'm Kailyn.

2669
01:38:06,499 --> 01:38:07,332
- [Gary] Hi Kailyn.

2670
01:38:07,332 --> 01:38:10,374
- This is crazy, to like
literally be face-to-face

2671
01:38:10,374 --> 01:38:11,903
with you right now, so thank you so much

2672
01:38:11,903 --> 01:38:14,082
for answering my question.

2673
01:38:14,082 --> 01:38:15,701
One of the reasons that I love you so much

2674
01:38:15,701 --> 01:38:16,984
and love following you so much

2675
01:38:16,984 --> 01:38:18,559
is I really resonate with the whole

2676
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:20,924
chip on the shoulder thing.

2677
01:38:20,924 --> 01:38:24,356
That's what drives everything that I do.

2678
01:38:24,356 --> 01:38:25,801
I grew up super poor.

2679
01:38:25,801 --> 01:38:28,071
At least standing here with
all these people right now

2680
01:38:28,071 --> 01:38:30,600
is just insanely surreal.

2681
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:33,039
- [Gary] Right, and you
wanna kill them, right?

2682
01:38:33,039 --> 01:38:33,872
- I don't wanna kill them,

2683
01:38:33,872 --> 01:38:35,196
I wanna like work with all of you

2684
01:38:35,196 --> 01:38:37,140
and just like, hit me up, please.

2685
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:38,000
(attendees laughing)

2686
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,106
But this thing that's happened is,

2687
01:38:40,106 --> 01:38:43,121
I feel like an entrepreneur
on accident, honestly

2688
01:38:43,121 --> 01:38:45,932
and the things that I
love to do is the business

2689
01:38:45,932 --> 01:38:47,130
that I do that's making me money.

2690
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:49,651
But recently, I've started
being like way more vulnerable

2691
01:38:49,651 --> 01:38:51,722
about the whole chip on the shoulder thing

2692
01:38:51,722 --> 01:38:54,490
and like in telling my story.

2693
01:38:54,490 --> 01:38:56,891
And that's resonating with a lot of people

2694
01:38:56,891 --> 01:38:58,212
but that's fuckin' hard.

2695
01:38:58,212 --> 01:38:59,695
Like I hate doing that.

2696
01:38:59,695 --> 01:39:01,516
- Because?
- I'm very introverted.

2697
01:39:01,516 --> 01:39:04,995
I don't like being out there that much

2698
01:39:04,995 --> 01:39:07,682
but that's what seems to be
making the biggest impact, so.

2699
01:39:07,682 --> 01:39:09,505
- I have great news.

2700
01:39:09,505 --> 01:39:10,955
It's binary.

2701
01:39:10,955 --> 01:39:13,560
Either you do more of it
and you get used to it,

2702
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:14,635
and like everything in life,

2703
01:39:14,635 --> 01:39:16,206
once you get used to it,

2704
01:39:16,206 --> 01:39:18,609
it just becomes your norm
and you didn't realize it.

2705
01:39:18,609 --> 01:39:20,706
Now you may never be the most extroverted,

2706
01:39:20,706 --> 01:39:21,539
but you just.

2707
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:23,975
Everybody here can be
a better singer, dancer

2708
01:39:23,975 --> 01:39:24,920
and basketball player.

2709
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:27,854
They may not become LeBron,
but if you do it everyday,

2710
01:39:27,854 --> 01:39:28,811
you get better.

2711
01:39:28,811 --> 01:39:30,710
You keep putting yourself
out there every day,

2712
01:39:30,710 --> 01:39:32,120
you'll get better.

2713
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:34,346
So you can either choose to do that

2714
01:39:34,346 --> 01:39:36,168
or you could say I don't like it.

2715
01:39:36,168 --> 01:39:37,732
I'll leave the money on the table

2716
01:39:37,732 --> 01:39:39,591
because I love the privacy
and the private life

2717
01:39:39,591 --> 01:39:42,195
and not having to engage and you do that.

2718
01:39:42,195 --> 01:39:43,187
It's your choice.

2719
01:39:43,187 --> 01:39:45,124
You're in charge.

2720
01:39:45,124 --> 01:39:48,104
- Are you an advocate for doing
like what's harder though?

2721
01:39:48,104 --> 01:39:48,937
If that can make

2722
01:39:48,937 --> 01:39:50,531
a bigger impact?
- I'm an advocate on doing

2723
01:39:50,531 --> 01:39:52,181
what you wanna do,

2724
01:39:52,181 --> 01:39:56,131
not because I said so
or your friend said so.

2725
01:39:56,131 --> 01:39:59,232
Its, I'm an advocate of you
doing what you wanna be doing,

2726
01:39:59,232 --> 01:40:03,780
but I always encourage to
taste more 'cause it works.

2727
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:07,761
You know how many people here hate oysters

2728
01:40:07,761 --> 01:40:09,290
but have never had one?

2729
01:40:09,290 --> 01:40:11,651
(attendees laughing)

2730
01:40:11,651 --> 01:40:13,471
I think about that shit everyday.

2731
01:40:13,471 --> 01:40:14,749
(attendees laughing)

2732
01:40:14,749 --> 01:40:16,650
That's how I think about business.

2733
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:19,503
Like you've made a judgment on something

2734
01:40:19,503 --> 01:40:22,065
yet you've never done it.

2735
01:40:22,065 --> 01:40:25,078
So, you know what I'm gonna say,

2736
01:40:25,078 --> 01:40:27,306
you know you've like consumed it.

2737
01:40:27,306 --> 01:40:30,649
I mean I already know
you're gonna do more of it

2738
01:40:30,649 --> 01:40:32,177
because you've already
done the hardest part

2739
01:40:32,177 --> 01:40:34,117
which is you've done it.

2740
01:40:34,117 --> 01:40:37,264
You're now a foregone
conclusion to me, KP.

2741
01:40:37,264 --> 01:40:38,171
You're just gonna keep doing it.

2742
01:40:38,171 --> 01:40:39,485
- I love that you just
called me that, thank you.

2743
01:40:39,485 --> 01:40:41,365
- [Gary] You know, like,
that's what you're gonna do.

2744
01:40:41,365 --> 01:40:42,317
- Okay.

2745
01:40:42,317 --> 01:40:43,762
- You're just looking for me
to give you a little more juice

2746
01:40:43,762 --> 01:40:45,030
to do it a little bit more,
and a little bit more,

2747
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:46,646
and a little bit more which is amazing

2748
01:40:46,646 --> 01:40:48,167
and I'm thrilled to do it
'cause it's fuckin' free.

2749
01:40:48,167 --> 01:40:49,076
Here you go, go!

2750
01:40:49,076 --> 01:40:50,069
- [Kailyn] Thank you.

2751
01:40:50,069 --> 01:40:50,902
- You're welcome.

2752
01:40:50,902 --> 01:40:51,735
- Just really quickly.

2753
01:40:51,735 --> 01:40:52,966
Is there anything that is hard for you?

2754
01:40:52,966 --> 01:40:55,319
Like I know like , no.

2755
01:40:55,319 --> 01:40:57,717
Your mindset, the way that
you think about things,

2756
01:40:57,717 --> 01:40:59,166
you're like I am confident, I can do this,

2757
01:40:59,166 --> 01:40:59,999
but like is it hard.

2758
01:40:59,999 --> 01:41:00,832
- [Gary] Yes, yes.

2759
01:41:00,832 --> 01:41:02,347
- To get up in the morning sometimes?

2760
01:41:02,347 --> 01:41:03,302
- [Gary] No, nope.

2761
01:41:03,302 --> 01:41:04,591
- Is anything hard at all?

2762
01:41:04,591 --> 01:41:07,160
- Spelling is fuckin' impossible.

2763
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:08,368
(attendees laughing)

2764
01:41:08,368 --> 01:41:10,114
I can't read for shit.

2765
01:41:10,114 --> 01:41:12,351
If I was reading from a
teleprompter right now,

2766
01:41:12,351 --> 01:41:14,960
I would crumble and be out of here.

2767
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:16,452
Can't read for shit.

2768
01:41:16,452 --> 01:41:19,869
Like you know, fencing probably is hard.

2769
01:41:22,056 --> 01:41:24,693
Oh I'm really way below
average in swimming,

2770
01:41:24,693 --> 01:41:26,298
poor swimmer, like always think like fuck,

2771
01:41:26,298 --> 01:41:27,998
I'll be super pissed if I like.

2772
01:41:27,998 --> 01:41:30,768
If I die because we get fucked up,

2773
01:41:30,768 --> 01:41:33,253
like somebody hits a, and
I have to swim further

2774
01:41:33,253 --> 01:41:36,836
than everybody and
like, yeah there's shit.

2775
01:41:38,876 --> 01:41:42,109
You know why you asked that question?

2776
01:41:42,109 --> 01:41:42,942
- [Kailyn] Validation.

2777
01:41:42,942 --> 01:41:46,242
- No, why you asked me that question?

2778
01:41:46,242 --> 01:41:47,190
Validation the first part.

2779
01:41:47,190 --> 01:41:48,926
The second part.

2780
01:41:48,926 --> 01:41:51,939
You're asking me that as somebody
who knows a lot about me,

2781
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:55,386
because I don't spend any time on it.

2782
01:41:55,386 --> 01:41:57,053
We all suck at shit.

2783
01:41:58,475 --> 01:42:01,860
So like I don't care how you
judge mine, you got shit too.

2784
01:42:01,860 --> 01:42:03,917
So because I don't care about that,

2785
01:42:03,917 --> 01:42:06,237
the only reason people spend
time on their weaknesses

2786
01:42:06,237 --> 01:42:09,093
is because it's everybody
else's opinion on it

2787
01:42:09,093 --> 01:42:10,711
that they're trying to avoid.

2788
01:42:10,711 --> 01:42:12,613
I don't care about your
opinion about my weakness,

2789
01:42:12,613 --> 01:42:13,937
'cause I know you've got them, too.

2790
01:42:13,937 --> 01:42:15,770
So let's just move on.

2791
01:42:16,952 --> 01:42:17,785
- Thank you so much.

2792
01:42:17,785 --> 01:42:19,070
Can I get a photo with
you when you're done?

2793
01:42:19,070 --> 01:42:19,903
- [Gary] Yes.

2794
01:42:19,903 --> 01:42:20,903
- Thank you.

2795
01:42:21,915 --> 01:42:22,822
- [Gary] Hey, Charles.

2796
01:42:22,822 --> 01:42:24,112
- Hey Gary.

2797
01:42:24,112 --> 01:42:25,610
If you ever, I swim a lot,

2798
01:42:25,610 --> 01:42:26,443
so if you ever need somebody.

2799
01:42:26,443 --> 01:42:28,335
(laughing)

2800
01:42:28,335 --> 01:42:29,257
- [Charles] Thanks, bro.

2801
01:42:29,257 --> 01:42:31,060
- Let me know.

2802
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:34,700
I'm 37, so I'm not you know,
where you are at, age wise

2803
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:36,774
but you know, I've been
lucky a few times in life

2804
01:42:36,774 --> 01:42:38,964
and you know, I've done well

2805
01:42:38,964 --> 01:42:40,835
and done not so well on everything

2806
01:42:40,835 --> 01:42:42,197
and I have done well.

2807
01:42:42,197 --> 01:42:44,094
I guess my question is,

2808
01:42:44,094 --> 01:42:46,319
it's always the concept
of the encore, right?

2809
01:42:46,319 --> 01:42:48,212
You know when my one company,

2810
01:42:48,212 --> 01:42:50,536
I've had eight-digit companies before

2811
01:42:50,536 --> 01:42:52,142
and now I'm launching another one.

2812
01:42:52,142 --> 01:42:55,568
And I guess it's like
how do you get into it,

2813
01:42:55,568 --> 01:42:58,651
make bets on it but feel accomplished

2814
01:42:59,939 --> 01:43:02,299
if you don't outdo your last time?

2815
01:43:02,299 --> 01:43:05,406
- Because I do not even remotely think

2816
01:43:05,406 --> 01:43:09,239
that the financial part
is the way I score it.

2817
01:43:10,223 --> 01:43:11,658
You know what I mean?

2818
01:43:11,658 --> 01:43:12,601
I mean that's really simple.

2819
01:43:12,601 --> 01:43:16,025
Like outdoing the last one is, you know,

2820
01:43:16,025 --> 01:43:17,918
even the way you position
and listen to your words,

2821
01:43:17,918 --> 01:43:19,115
you're positioning it like,

2822
01:43:19,115 --> 01:43:23,185
if you're putting pressure on
that I need a niner, right?

2823
01:43:23,185 --> 01:43:25,695
Then you're then you're probably gonna.

2824
01:43:25,695 --> 01:43:28,496
Especially, you know what's
funny about positioning a niner

2825
01:43:28,496 --> 01:43:30,195
when you've had an eighter?

2826
01:43:30,195 --> 01:43:32,066
It's hard to get going.

2827
01:43:32,066 --> 01:43:33,332
- That's probably the challenge, yes.

2828
01:43:33,332 --> 01:43:35,892
- I know exactly what's
going on with you, Charles.

2829
01:43:35,892 --> 01:43:38,047
And so that's why I'm asking you,

2830
01:43:38,047 --> 01:43:40,159
are you doing the ambition of a nine or 10

2831
01:43:40,159 --> 01:43:42,463
or because you see the white space

2832
01:43:42,463 --> 01:43:44,764
and you're gonna strike
like a fuckin' cobra

2833
01:43:44,764 --> 01:43:48,641
or is it 'cause you really
just want to fuckin' do it?

2834
01:43:48,641 --> 01:43:50,163
So let me give me an example.

2835
01:43:50,163 --> 01:43:52,431
What I've been doing for
the last seven years.

2836
01:43:52,431 --> 01:43:53,764
I don't love it.

2837
01:43:54,708 --> 01:43:56,080
Client services?

2838
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:58,126
Like having a 32-year-old brand manager

2839
01:43:58,126 --> 01:43:59,417
from the University of Chicago

2840
01:43:59,417 --> 01:44:01,234
telling me what she should
do with Captain Crunch

2841
01:44:01,234 --> 01:44:03,263
when she can't sell shit?

2842
01:44:03,263 --> 01:44:04,914
- No, I'm actually from
the USDA, so, yeah.

2843
01:44:04,914 --> 01:44:07,880
- Great, yeah like not fun for me,

2844
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:09,344
but I know why I'm doing it.

2845
01:44:09,344 --> 01:44:12,691
I decided at 35, 36 that I was gonna spend

2846
01:44:12,691 --> 01:44:14,358
10 years of my prime

2847
01:44:15,215 --> 01:44:19,892
as a business person building
a Death Star of communication

2848
01:44:19,892 --> 01:44:22,829
by eating shit and building
a very big business

2849
01:44:22,829 --> 01:44:24,980
and then I was gonna
point that Death Star,

2850
01:44:24,980 --> 01:44:26,520
the Vayner X machine

2851
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:29,592
against the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation

2852
01:44:29,592 --> 01:44:32,903
because my brother has
it and I wanna cure it.

2853
01:44:32,903 --> 01:44:34,718
Some business that somebody comes along

2854
01:44:34,718 --> 01:44:35,720
that didn't know how to run it

2855
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:38,907
so I bought it for a million
and then I can get it to 100.

2856
01:44:38,907 --> 01:44:40,973
But I realized six, seven years ago,

2857
01:44:40,973 --> 01:44:43,258
fuck, I now know who I am.

2858
01:44:43,258 --> 01:44:45,107
Let me build the biggest infrastructure

2859
01:44:45,107 --> 01:44:46,217
in the world around it

2860
01:44:46,217 --> 01:44:49,734
and then whether it's to
help hurricane victims

2861
01:44:49,734 --> 01:44:51,753
or sell sneakers,

2862
01:44:51,753 --> 01:44:54,155
I'm gonna be able to
point this fuckin' thing.

2863
01:44:54,155 --> 01:44:57,749
So for me, I don't look at my EBITDA,

2864
01:44:57,749 --> 01:44:59,560
I don't care how much we're growing.

2865
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,202
I've made a 20-year decision

2866
01:45:01,202 --> 01:45:02,684
that I'm in the process of

2867
01:45:02,684 --> 01:45:03,934
and I'm gonna execute against that.

2868
01:45:03,934 --> 01:45:07,599
And the numbers and dollars
are just not the way I score.

2869
01:45:07,599 --> 01:45:10,089
If you've been lucky enough
to have the success you've had

2870
01:45:10,089 --> 01:45:12,615
and you're this young, I
would take a big step back

2871
01:45:12,615 --> 01:45:14,239
and try to figure out, you know,

2872
01:45:14,239 --> 01:45:17,214
what is like the most fun
or the most macro thesis

2873
01:45:17,214 --> 01:45:19,283
you can come up with.

2874
01:45:19,283 --> 01:45:20,116
- Great, thanks.

2875
01:45:20,116 --> 01:45:21,425
- You're welcome.

2876
01:45:21,425 --> 01:45:22,258
(attendees applauds)

2877
01:45:22,258 --> 01:45:24,675
Guys thank you for having me.

2878
01:45:25,606 --> 01:45:28,533
Thanks, it's awesome, thank you so much.

2879
01:45:28,533 --> 01:45:30,260
Hope you enjoyed that keynote.

2880
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:32,532
Now, the question from it.

2881
01:45:32,532 --> 01:45:36,868
What was your biggest new
takeaway from the talk in Boise?

2882
01:45:36,868 --> 00:00:00,000
(mellow music)
