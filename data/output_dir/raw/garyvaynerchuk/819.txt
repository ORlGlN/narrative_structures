1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,001
(applause)

2
00:00:05,391 --> 00:00:06,540
- [Gary] Thank you.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,875
Thank you guys for having me.

4
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:10,744
I'm super excited
to be here actually.

5
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:14,214
Let me some context on where I
come from because I'm going to

6
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,817
assume that a lot of you
don't know and then I'll spiel a

7
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:20,521
little bit about a couple point
of view I have that might be

8
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,289
interesting given the audience.

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,025
And then I'd love to go into Q&amp;A
'cause I think that's when the

10
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,693
most interesting stuff happens.

11
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,973
So I was born in the
former Soviet Union.

12
00:00:29,973 --> 00:00:32,266
I came to the US
when I was three.

13
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,001
We grew up super poor.

14
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,936
I lived in a studio apartment

15
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,438
in Queens with eight
family members.

16
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:41,308
It was a really
tough upbringing.

17
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:45,786
My dad got a job as a stock
boy in a liquor store making

18
00:00:45,786 --> 00:00:48,140
two bucks an hour.

19
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,941
I kinda grew up with that
American dream

20
00:00:49,941 --> 00:00:52,423
merchant kind of world.

21
00:00:52,423 --> 00:00:55,689
We were very immigrant saved
every dollar and eventually five

22
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:58,058
or six years into the US my dad

23
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,295
bought a small liquor store
in New Jersey.

24
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,897
I moved to Jersey
when I was six.

25
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,434
I was very entrepreneurial
lemonade stand, baseball cards,

26
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:11,038
washing cars, raking leaves,
shoveling snow anything to kinda

27
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:13,106
make a buck.

28
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:17,511
When I was in the US, when I was
12 or 13 baseball cards were a

29
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:18,412
very big deal.

30
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,447
Everybody collected them.

31
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:23,617
I was making one to $2000 a
weekend selling baseball cards

32
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,855
as a 12, 13-year-old.

33
00:01:25,855 --> 00:01:27,621
Probably the
richest I'll ever be.

34
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:32,215
That was great but then I turned
14 and I was first-generation

35
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:35,395
oldest son from the old country
which meant I got put dragged

36
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,230
into my dad's liquor store.

37
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,768
Got paid two bucks an hour to
bag ice for 15 hours a day.

38
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,036
So it's kind of hard core.

39
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,599
I always tell a lot of my
friends that I grew up much more

40
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,240
like their grandparents than

41
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,077
they did 'cause we were
so first-generation.

42
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:53,947
When I was 17 I realized that
people collected wine and that

43
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,216
was a big deal for me because I
didn't want to go into my family

44
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,706
business though I wanted to
'cause I thought I could do much

45
00:01:58,706 --> 00:02:00,617
better than my dad.

46
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:04,491
But I wasn't passionate about
selling beer or liquor but this

47
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:08,161
wine thing was super interesting
to me and by the time I was 18

48
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:12,566
somewhere between 16 and 18
I went completely all-in.

49
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,234
Scary to think back how

50
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,603
much I learned about 
wine as a teenager.

51
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:20,107
And I decided that I wanted to
open up 4,000 wine shops all

52
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:22,242
across America.

53
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,111
Eventually build a big business,

54
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:26,646
sell it and buy 
the New York Jets.

55
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,150
Which is my career ambition.

56
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,221
When I was 18 even though I only
spent about 30 minutes of my

57
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,623
life on a
computer at that point.

58
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:37,891
I was in college.

59
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:42,929
And I went to my friends dorm
room and I heard the dial-up

60
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,908
internet sound
for the first time.

61
00:02:44,908 --> 00:02:50,822
And in 1994 about 14 minutes
into surfing the web I ended up

62
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:56,114
on a bulletin board in AOL that
was selling baseball cards and

63
00:02:56,114 --> 00:03:01,329
I realized that I could sell
shit through this machine.

64
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:05,682
24 months later I launched one
of the first three e-commerce

65
00:03:05,682 --> 00:03:10,946
wine businesses in America
called WineLibrary.com and that

66
00:03:10,946 --> 00:03:11,904
became my career.

67
00:03:11,904 --> 00:03:14,703
Spent $15,000 on
building that website.

68
00:03:14,703 --> 00:03:18,878
I was still at university and so
nobody back home at the liquor

69
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:20,333
store knew what to do with it.

70
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,314
So on that $15,000 investment
the wine e-commerce site in the

71
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:28,875
first two years of operations
sold less than $2000 in wine.

72
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:33,180
I don't know how many of you
have a Soviet father but

73
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,715
Sasha Vaynerchuk was not
happy with the ROI.

74
00:03:38,724 --> 00:03:42,889
In 1998, I came home and
took over the business.

75
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:48,862
And from 1998 until 2003 in a
five-year window I grew my dad's

76
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:53,967
business from a $3 million to
a $65 million a year business.

77
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:59,239
I did it on the religion that
allows me the humbleness to sit

78
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,974
in front of you guys here today.

79
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,010
Which is when you have no
money and the business just for

80
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,515
context did $3 million in
revenue, 10% gross profit.

81
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:11,685
So $300,000 before expenses.

82
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:15,088
Luckily, Sasha didn't pay
anybody anything but still there

83
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,555
was really no money.

84
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:19,659
The only way to build that
business as quickly as I did

85
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,696
especially in a time when the
internet was quite immature and

86
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,988
there wasn't the kind of user
base that we all have now,

87
00:04:24,988 --> 00:04:28,802
there was no venture capital.
There was no M&amp;A activity.

88
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,905
I built it because I made every
penny of my advertising work

89
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,907
like hundred dollar bill.

90
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:38,512
How I did that in 1996 was I
launched an e-commerce site when

91
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,280
nobody did that.

92
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,217
In 1997 I launch an email
newsletter that had 200,000

93
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:49,303
people on it that had 91% open
rates and 55% click through to

94
00:04:49,303 --> 00:04:53,693
add to cart button because in
1997 nobody was doing email

95
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:57,664
marketing in the US market or
any market for that matter.

96
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:01,234
The day Google Adwords came out
in 2000 I bought the word wine

97
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:05,672
and I owned it nine
months for five cents a click.

98
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,075
Basically my career is very
different than the legendary

99
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:13,050
status of this agency which is
all of my career in the first

100
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,217
5 to 7 years was predicated on 
the one thing that is my religion.

101
00:05:18,897 --> 00:05:22,189
It's a smart thing and a thing
that I believe in my heart to

102
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:25,469
say in this room, I truly
believe that creative is the

103
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:27,677
variable of success.

104
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:30,931
The creative is the difference
between selling 1,000 cases of

105
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,866
that wine or one
bottle of that wine.

106
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,535
And I think that is
way will be forever.

107
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:41,208
My problem, my excitement, my
debates, my passion, my hours

108
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,211
are spent on the fact that I
believe most people deployed

109
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:49,649
creative into a gap of
attention that is overpriced.

110
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:54,120
My career was built on buying
attention at a very low cost.

111
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,526
E-commerce, email marketing and
Google Adwords in '97, 2000 was

112
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:03,063
grossly underpriced by the
creative and advertising shops

113
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,664
of the world and 
by the businesses

114
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:05,632
and startups of the world.

115
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,201
And that's why I was able to
build such a big business.

116
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,605
I continued that path with
banner retargeting when that

117
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:15,041
wasn't a thing and my career
took a really different turn and

118
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,244
probably started my 
path to the seat

119
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:20,080
in 2006 when YouTube came out.

120
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,083
YouTube came out, I thought
it was going to be a big deal.

121
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,151
And within four months 
of YouTube being

122
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,554
alive I started a wine show.

123
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:32,325
And every day for five years I
sat in front of a camera for 20

124
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,494
minutes and drank
four bottles of wine.

125
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,161
(laughter)

126
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,598
It was a good gig.

127
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:44,170
In the first year and a half of
YouTube, 2006 to 2007 1/2 very

128
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,105
few people watched it.

129
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,707
There was not a single
video that had a million views.

130
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:48,942
It was building.

131
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:54,214
By 2008, I was selling hundreds
of cases of wine per episode if

132
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:57,984
I reviewed the wines carefully
and properly and it was the

133
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,987
first time in my career that I
was selling stuff where there

134
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,323
was no paid distribution.

135
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:06,359
It was completely predicated
on the content itself and the

136
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,084
organic distribution 
of the channel.

137
00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:13,819
A few months later Google
bought YouTube for $1.6 billion.

138
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:16,636
That was the point
where my career changed.

139
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:20,340
I read an article that Ron Conway 
angel investor was set to

140
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:25,148
make $25 million on his $50,000
investment and it was the first

141
00:07:25,148 --> 00:07:28,948
time I realized this gift of
being about right about e-com

142
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:33,747
and Google Adwords and email and
Google and YouTube it has to pay

143
00:07:33,747 --> 00:07:34,988
off more than selling a

144
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,490
couple more cases of 
Bordeaux or Burgundy.

145
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,067
And so I promised myself the
next time I felt it, the next

146
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:43,657
time I felt that feeling that
is so dictated the success of my

147
00:07:43,657 --> 00:07:46,272
life that I would invest.

148
00:07:46,272 --> 00:07:50,070
I went to SXSW the following
March because I wanted to learn

149
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,995
more about this web 2.0
thing that was happening.

150
00:07:53,995 --> 00:07:57,344
There was an app everybody was
making fun of called Twitter.

151
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:00,413
I thought it reminded me a
lot of early email marketing.

152
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,982
I became very friendly with
the founders and a couple months

153
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,386
later I invested in Twitter
at a $50 million valuation.

154
00:08:07,926 --> 00:08:10,323
A couple weeks later I
made my first business video.

155
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,093
It was called, "Facebook should
be worried about Twitter."

156
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,562
I explained why I thought
Twitter was a very exciting

157
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,765
thing and why this new
force Facebook should be paying

158
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:19,966
attention to it.

159
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,629
It led to Mark Zuckerberg's team
reaching out to me, I flew out

160
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:25,672
to Palo Alto and
spoke to their company.

161
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,273
Gave a talk about 
consumer behavior

162
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,342
and the attention graph.

163
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,678
Mark luckily agreed
with a lot of stuff.

164
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,849
We had dinner and a couple weeks
later I bought a shit load of

165
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:36,416
stock from his parents.

166
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,784
A week later I came home to
New York had my first lunch with

167
00:08:39,784 --> 00:08:44,022
David Karp, decided that Tumblr
was gonna be a big deal.

168
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,129
Three months later 
I invested in Tumblr.

169
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:49,295
So as an investor I'll probably

170
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:52,165
never do better than my 
first three investments.

171
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:56,169
I've gone on to invest in
BirchBox and Uber and BuddyMedia

172
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,471
and Wildfire and a lot of good
things and have done quite well

173
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:02,442
but back then I understood that
all those platforms attention

174
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:03,309
was underpriced.

175
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,679
It's the way that I know that
any brand in the world that you

176
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:11,084
work with definitely now the UK,
in the US and many other markets

177
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:15,055
if they are trying to sell
something sneakers, a soda,

178
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:20,040
a piece of candy, clothing to a
15 to 25-year-old 95% of the

179
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,230
ideas in this room, at Vayner and 
many other rooms are not going to

180
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,367
work because were going to
deploy stories in places where

181
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,603
15 to 25-year-olds are not
spending their attention.

182
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:34,074
I'll use Mondelez, Sour Patch
Kids was probably one of our

183
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,209
most interesting
case studies in US.

184
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,845
The brand manager literally
almost got fired for doing what

185
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:45,585
I recommended to be done which
was in 2014 they spent all of

186
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,789
their money on a commercial that
was running on Spike television

187
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,425
because they were trying to
reach 15 to 25-year-olds.

188
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,861
Business was down 7 1/2%.

189
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,948
In 2015, when we took over the
business we moved every single

190
00:09:57,948 --> 00:10:00,880
dollar to only
Instagram and Snapchat.

191
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,870
There was no reporting
to justify the spend.

192
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,894
Mondelez's modeling mix didn't
prove that moving those dollars

193
00:10:07,894 --> 00:10:10,443
to those channels
was gonna do anything.

194
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,980
The first nine months of our
activities because the reporting

195
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,284
wasn't back yet, the brand
manager was literally on the

196
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,521
process of being fired
out of the organization.

197
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:24,234
When it was all said and done
last year's Sour Patch Kids in

198
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:26,426
the US had the fastest growth of

199
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,062
any candy brand 
in the last 10 years.

200
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:31,030
Because I don't know if you know
that this is a crazy fucking

201
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,201
thought but 15 to 25-year-olds
spend their attention in

202
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,170
Instagram and Snapchat.

203
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:42,041
We have right now in marketing
and just all over the world a

204
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:47,614
stunning disrespect for
attention and a gross

205
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:53,620
overwhelming, overwhelming
respect for bullshit metrics,

206
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,490
headlines, awards and a ton a
shit that has nothing to do it

207
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,058
with actually selling product.

208
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,161
Now, now.

209
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:01,995
Thank you my man.

210
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,555
Now.

211
00:11:03,555 --> 00:11:06,299
That being said it is an
interesting thing because I'll

212
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,401
say this and this is super
important to say here because

213
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,171
I think context is everything.

214
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,674
I am in advertising now for
the last seven years really I've

215
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,376
been running the company
for the last five years.

216
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,379
Just for context since you're in
this world I've grown the agency

217
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:23,883
from 30 to 650 people from three
to $100 million in revenue.

218
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:28,001
No M-and-A, no cash infusion.

219
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:29,955
And I'm still selling
something nobody wants.

220
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,565
Nobody wants our creative.

221
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:35,303
Nobody even thinks of
VaynerMedia as a creative shop.

222
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:39,339
And I know enough, 
I don't know much about

223
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:41,534
the advertising world, right?

224
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,748
If you told me you'd give me
$50 billion right now if I could

225
00:11:44,748 --> 00:11:48,986
name the CEO of your company or
any other company I would not be

226
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:50,834
able to do that.

227
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:52,579
I don't know it.

228
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,747
When I go to Cannes I feel super
out of place because I have no

229
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,050
idea what the fuck
anybody is talking about.

230
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,785
I don't know the
space very well.

231
00:11:58,785 --> 00:11:59,786
I mean that.

232
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:04,357
And so the reason I just did
that little rant was I do know

233
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:07,226
enough as a matter of fact I
even use it your guy's name in

234
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,496
some of my speeches because 
I know this is a special place.

235
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:14,000
I know this is one of those
places that is so well known for

236
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,769
their great creative and
things of that nature.

237
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:20,573
And I am funny guy because I
speak so much about creative

238
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,042
being subjective because it is.

239
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,913
It is subjective when it's you
and it's me and I run Dove

240
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:30,883
and you're the creative lead for
Wieden and it's just you and I

241
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,798
and we decide that this 
idea versus that idea

242
00:12:33,798 --> 00:12:35,822
is what goes on television.

243
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,724
That is 100% subjective.

244
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:38,424
Just so everybody knows.

245
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,860
It's 100 fucking
percent subjective.

246
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,597
Now when it goes into real
life it becomes not subjective.

247
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,232
The market decides.

248
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:52,639
However, what bothers me is it
made a lot of sense from 1955 to

249
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,383
2010 to do it that way.

250
00:12:56,383 --> 00:13:02,215
Because you didn't have the
ability to scale your IP prior

251
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,950
to putting it in the market.

252
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,353
For every "Just Do It" and
"MasterCard Priceless" there

253
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:11,421
have been thousands, in this
room, this is so interesting to

254
00:13:11,421 --> 00:13:14,627
me, this is funny I haven't
really spoken too much at shops

255
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,804
like this.

256
00:13:15,804 --> 00:13:19,165
Creative shops in general and
definitely not at this level.

257
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:24,570
In this room, there have been 5
to 11 ideas at individual levels

258
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,261
that literally were they game
changing idea for a business

259
00:13:28,261 --> 00:13:32,445
that never saw the day of life
because of the way creative and

260
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:35,982
brands work
together in a 2016 world.

261
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,582
Because you were too junior and
the senior person decided not

262
00:13:39,582 --> 00:13:42,121
that idea, this idea. Right?

263
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,088
Or because when you presented
it, the brand manager and you

264
00:13:45,088 --> 00:13:47,894
guys I assume this is how 
you guys think about it

265
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,162
it's fun for me to watch.

266
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,198
As I have mapped what we do for
a living I look at the people

267
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,475
that make the decision to run
shit and I'm like this is the

268
00:13:55,475 --> 00:13:57,437
craziest shit I've ever seen.

269
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:00,840
These are actual business
operators which by the way as I

270
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,143
think you guys are getting I
didn't grow drawing and fucking

271
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:04,911
being an artist.

272
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,045
I'm a salesman.

273
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,981
I love brand managers I love
people who give a shit about

274
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,752
margin and fucking stacking
end caps and selling shit.

275
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,487
That is my religion.

276
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:15,588
I love them.

277
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:19,392
But do I think they are the
right person to make a judgment

278
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,227
call on a creative execution?

279
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:21,894
I do not.

280
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,930
And I see it every single day.

281
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,300
And so the whole model to me is
fundamentally broken because I

282
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,702
have the ability, 
and the luxury honestly,

283
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,738
to come from outside eyes.

284
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,005
I don't know any different.

285
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,942
I didn't know why awards and
headlines meant so much in this

286
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:40,413
world until I realized ah,
that's how agencies get talent

287
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:41,748
and get new clients.

288
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,117
Of course that
makes so much sense.

289
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:47,787
I don't understand why media
buying agencies tell all their

290
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:50,990
clients to do programmatic ad
buying when there's literally no

291
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,960
worse piece of fucking
advertising in the world than a

292
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,896
banner on a fucking website
when the whole world is going to

293
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,699
mobile and you don't even see
the banner ad because on the

294
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:04,012
bottom left hand corner, below
the fold on womenswomens.org.

295
00:15:04,012 --> 00:15:06,072
(laughter)

296
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,908
But then I'm like oh, I see
because that's the highest

297
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:13,179
profit margin for
Group M and Digitas.

298
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,680
That's why they push it.

299
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,585
As you start getting in it
if you don't understand the

300
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:23,256
historical context, if you
don't, if you're just not

301
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,726
romantic about the way it was
you start understanding pieces

302
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:27,827
of this industry.

303
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:31,831
Here's the punchline problem, or
the opportunity just depends on

304
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:36,102
where you sit on this issue,
we're going into a day and age

305
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:40,006
where technology is catching up
to two fundamental things that

306
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:42,241
are going to matter to everybody
in this room and everybody

307
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,143
outside of this building.

308
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:48,815
Which is data is catching up to
justify and understand what the

309
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51,217
ROI is of things more
and more every single day.

310
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:52,685
If you really understand.

311
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:53,986
I really nice advantage.

312
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:57,323
I live my life really more in
Silicon Valley than I do in

313
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,660
Madison Avenue and so for
example I'm an investor in many

314
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,496
startups right now that
already have pilot programs with

315
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,766
Coca-Cola and Green Mountain
Coffee and Procter &amp; Gamble

316
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:09,635
where their packages are
"smartified" and you can

317
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,005
actually start justifying and
understanding the whole funnel

318
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:13,840
of the transaction.

319
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,741
You can start quantifying
some of the behaviors.

320
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,611
It's gonna be fucked, we're
going to understand what we do

321
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:22,181
for a living here more than ever
before in a ten year period.

322
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,383
And I'm not talking about direct
response, I'm talking about

323
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,419
branding and how it justifies

324
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,354
controled test with
smart packaging.

325
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:31,290
Really understanding
the ROI of things.

326
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,293
At the same token and I think
you guys know this every single

327
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:38,798
day technology's moving into a
world where they're blocking

328
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:42,268
advertising because advertising
my friends for the last 70 years

329
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,731
has done one thing more than
it's on anything else;

330
00:16:44,731 --> 00:16:48,241
It's stolen time from
the end consumer.

331
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:52,278
Advertising for the last 70
years has been built to not let

332
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:55,748
you do what you actually wanted
to do, stop you and then tell

333
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,550
you about something.

334
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,254
You're watching a show, and all
of a sudden it stops and we try

335
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,489
to sell you fucking beer. Right?

336
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,325
You're reading an article you
turn the next page you want to

337
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,227
finish your fucking article, no.

338
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,262
We're gonna give you a
full page of a fucking car.

339
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,992
Right?

340
00:17:11,992 --> 00:17:14,767
This is what advertising
has done and online too.

341
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,069
You go to ESPN.com, we're
not going to let you read the

342
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,570
article the whole fucking page
is going to be taken out by an

343
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,606
Acura fucking car riding at me.

344
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,285
Right?

345
00:17:23,285 --> 00:17:27,179
And so what we have is we
have the world of advertising

346
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,981
stealing our time while when you

347
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:32,385
look at DVR did if you
actually understand.

348
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,655
One of the great mistakes of
my career is I passed on

349
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,057
Uber's angel round twice.

350
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,594
Very friendly with the founding
team passed twice invested the

351
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:45,197
next round because it came to
New York and I understood holy

352
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:49,568
shit Uber doesn't sell
transportation, Uber sells time.

353
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,572
The reason people take Ubers is
even the perception of the car

354
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,409
being there, the perception
of those five minutes if you

355
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,210
actually look at your own
behavior and I don't know your

356
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,681
financial status but you will
be stunned no matter where your

357
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,784
financial status is the world
if you look at big data how much

358
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:08,220
people spend on time,
convenience when they can't even

359
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,489
afford it because
it's important to them.

360
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,959
And if you look at what
advertising has been built on

361
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,561
it's been stealing
time versus vice versa.

362
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:18,631
So when I think about all of
the digital marketing that

363
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,199
everybody's doing.

364
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:24,136
And how much of it is predicated
on time stealing in a desktop

365
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:28,007
environment when oh, I don't
know if you heard this is the

366
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,576
only fucking way we're going
to consume the internet, right?

367
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,079
And it's happening on an
everyday basis and all those

368
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:36,549
tactics don't work here,
I'm fascinated by that stuff.

369
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:40,553
And look the other thing,
and look I is assume this is a

370
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:43,589
television shop from
what I know and things.

371
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:48,728
Listen, I do not understand
how everybody in this room as a

372
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:53,132
commonsense human being doesn't
understand that television

373
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:57,036
commercials are in major, major
friction against the market

374
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:57,837
right now.

375
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:03,009
People are not consuming as
much television, commercials.

376
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:07,046
It's so funny all my TV creative
shop friends CEOs that I meet at

377
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,080
things they're like,

378
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,749
"Gary TV consumption 
is through the roof."

379
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,417
I'm like, "No shit.

380
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,252
"Everybody is
watching 'Breaking Bad'.

381
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:16,288
"Everybody's watching fucking
'House of Card' and everybody's

382
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:19,025
"fucking watching 'Game of
Thrones' but who the fuck is

383
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:21,627
"watching the commercials?"

384
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:26,565
Fast forwarding globally has
declined last year for the first

385
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:31,470
time during DVR and TiVo and
those things because the new

386
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,473
behavior and you know this
because you actually do it as a

387
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:38,077
human, maybe not as a marketer
and as a creative but as a human

388
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:41,080
you do the second you're
watching something and a

389
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,184
commercial comes
on you grab this.

390
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,620
Everybody loves to talk about
live sports commercials being

391
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,189
this great thing, I don't
understand why people don't look

392
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:55,094
at the most basic data which
is the singular biggest lift in

393
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:58,998
Twitter activity is during
global sporting events when they

394
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,533
go to commercials.

395
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,936
Because you know after something
happens you grab your phone and

396
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:08,040
you want to tell everybody your
opinion on LeBron James' dunk or

397
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,243
your opinion on that 
big match or the big fight or

398
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,712
whatever you just saw.

399
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:16,649
So what happens is your
attention's here while some Jeep

400
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,652
goes up the mountain over there.

401
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:23,122
My friends, listen, listen, I
have no interest in coming in

402
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:26,358
here and saying oh what you do I
just want you to know one thing

403
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:33,666
if you go look at what happened
in the 1950s to the early '60s

404
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:38,117
when the society switched from
radio to television it is an

405
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:40,573
absolute preview to what 
is happening as we

406
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,941
live and breathe today.

407
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,677
This is the television.

408
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:46,045
And the television is the radio.

409
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,748
And you do it every single day.

410
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:52,418
And more importantly go walk
outside and watch the 40 and 50

411
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,286
and 60-year-olds do it too.

412
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:57,957
This is not a
13-year-old girl phenomenon.

413
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,760
And social media just for kicks
and giggles just to settle this

414
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,361
fucking conversation 
once and for all

415
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,896
there is no social media.

416
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:07,133
It is a slang term that
somebody came up with.

417
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:10,569
It's a term that we use for the
current state of the internet.

418
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:14,406
And if you believe in this thing
just kicks and giggles this is

419
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:19,245
just data 53% of all of our
attention, 53% of all of our

420
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:22,948
attention on this device,
this is added up time on apps.

421
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,250
Not opinion

422
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,485
is spent on social networks.

423
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,788
When you start looking at social
media as the current state of

424
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:32,057
the internet where people's
attention actually it a gets a

425
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,727
lot harder to disrespect it.

426
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:38,230
But the skill that sits so
heavily in this room

427
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,698
doesn't go away.

428
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:43,435
It just has to, in my opinion,
one man's opinion, it just has

429
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:46,572
the change its context to where
the stories are being told.

430
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:50,309
It's funny when I started my
company I started hiring fancy

431
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:54,313
creatives, creative directors
from this place and Droga 5 and

432
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,449
72 and Sunny and all
these fuckin' places, right?

433
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,486
All of the creatives hated me
because they would go watch two

434
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,188
videos and they'd hear
something like this.

435
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:05,090
What they didn't realize what I
believe is the following: How

436
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,960
many of you in this room by show
of hands I just want to know

437
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,497
have seen the Extra gum
commercial that's run on YouTube

438
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,999
or Facebook the two-minute
version of where the guy draws

439
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,501
the love notes in the
Extra gum wrappers?

440
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,369
Please raise your
hand for my own context.

441
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,747
Raise it high.
I want to see how many.

442
00:22:18,747 --> 00:22:20,039
All right, five.

443
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:23,319
(laughter)

444
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:27,389
I get it.

445
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:28,489
Respect.

446
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:30,316
It's probably why 
I saw it at first too.

447
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:33,385
We're on that gum business too.

448
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,266
So that was fascinating to me.

449
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:37,556
I think you guys will
get a kick of the story.

450
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:41,961
In the US there's a video you
can see it online they ran a 30

451
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:46,866
second spot version of it for 7
1/2 months and the business and

452
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:52,738
again maybe listen this is very
honest truth I do stereotype

453
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,674
that a lot of agencies actually
don't care about selling stuff.

454
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,277
But here's the good news, I've
come to learn that a lot of my

455
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,412
clients don't actually don't
want to sell stuff either.

456
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:03,115
People behaviors predicate
on the personal interest.

457
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,017
Of course you want to do
award-winning work, it's good

458
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:05,718
for your career.

459
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,087
Of course my people want
headlines, my clients they want

460
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,089
headlines because
then they get promoted.

461
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,023
Everything's backwards.

462
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:13,092
People are just humans and
they're reverse engineering in

463
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,261
their own vested interest
and they should, I'm not mad.

464
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:16,729
It's just life.

465
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,411
It's just true.

466
00:23:18,411 --> 00:23:24,904
Anyway 30 second spot nine
months decline, decline in sales

467
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,706
they made a full version of it
they go, "You know, what the

468
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:30,309
hell let's put it on Facebook."

469
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:34,480
The one minute and 53 second
version of it is a far more

470
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,881
compelling story.

471
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,264
It didn't have to fit into the
box of a system that was built

472
00:23:38,264 --> 00:23:40,986
in 19-fucking-65.

473
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:44,189
And the person that was a
creative and the writer actually

474
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:47,426
got to tell their fucking story
the way it was meant to be told.

475
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,695
And you know I don't know if you
know but there's a lot of people

476
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:51,096
on Facebook.

477
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,198
This whole scale thing
is really intriguing.

478
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,700
There's plenty of fucking scale.

479
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,636
There's more scale on Facebook
every day of the week than there

480
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,939
is on any number one television
show in the world times 10.

481
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,175
Just raw data, unemotional.

482
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:06,912
So remarkable thing happened.

483
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,581
I don't know, just stunning,
funny things happens because,

484
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,984
I don't know, stories
in video form, work.

485
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:12,918
I think we'll all agree.

486
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,620
Because it was actually
consumed, because it was

487
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:19,491
actually told as a story in it's
full complete way and because

488
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,628
people have the ability to pass
things on on Facebook, I can't

489
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:26,999
take my TV and throw it to
somebody, the product exploded.

490
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:28,734
The video exploded.

491
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:33,906
It went secondarily on YouTube
which I think now has 15 million

492
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,007
views or something absurd.

493
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:39,478
And the business has been up
double digits every day since 30

494
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,512
day after they put up on

495
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:44,717
Facebook for the last
seven months.

496
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,885
Everything you do
for a living works.

497
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:50,522
My argument to the whole God
damn marketplace is you're

498
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,809
telling the stories in places
where people aren't anymore.

499
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:55,861
It's declining by the minute.

500
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,830
Do I think people
randomly catch commercials?

501
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,164
Of course.

502
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,601
Do I think it is
massively overpriced attention?

503
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,969
Yes I do.

504
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:08,440
Why is billboard pricing
globally, in the world, up 12%

505
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,111
when every single person here
when on the bus or in a taxi or

506
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:15,180
not the primary driver is
looking at their telephone.

507
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,417
Can you tell me with any fucking
common sense that impressions on

508
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:20,252
billboard are more 
valuable today than

509
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:21,286
they were 10 years ago?

510
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,464
Absolutely not.

511
00:25:22,464 --> 00:25:23,756
It's the same reason I love

512
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:25,657
Super Bowl commercials, 
real quick.

513
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,560
On the flip side, I think the
Super Bowl commercial may be the

514
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,731
single most underpriced asset in
the world of attention, period.

515
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:33,799
In the US I think it was like

516
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,968
$5 or $6 million for a
spot this year.

517
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:38,570
I've recommended ABI and
Mondelez and Pepsi and all of my

518
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:43,642
clients to spend as much is $25
million on a spot because every

519
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:46,044
single person in
America watches it.

520
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,847
Everybody, whether they watched
on YouTube before or they watch

521
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:49,915
it when it airs.

522
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:53,786
Now the creative a lot of times
people are doing things for the

523
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:54,987
sake of winning.

524
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,789
Instead of the sake of
selling stuff but that's a whole

525
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,023
different conversation.

526
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,993
And really and honestly, I don't
even have a lot of passion about

527
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:03,262
that because I do think it is
subjective and actually I'm

528
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:04,663
sorry I got off this tangent.

529
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,832
I want to go back because I
think this is the part that may

530
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:09,968
my creative's finally like
me which has been a relief.

531
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:17,242
If you're a team of ECD, a CD,
and an ACD and you got a client

532
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,279
and you got a strategist and
you got an account person that

533
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:24,450
thinks they know what the deal
is and everybody is jamming, I

534
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,719
just love the idea of being able
to be in a place where if you

535
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:31,890
got an idea for
Trident gum, right?

536
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,561
That all four of you can see the
day of life of your story, you

537
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:40,365
can run it at scale on Facebook
you can get feedback from actual

538
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:43,569
consumers not focus groups where
we put them in weird rooms and

539
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:46,104
show them animatronics or
whatever the fuck you call it

540
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,506
and everyone's like
"Yeah, real good."

541
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:50,460
It makes no sense.

542
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,646
Every time I look at this stuff
I really, again maybe I'm too

543
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:57,382
foreign, maybe I'm wrong
which is very possible.

544
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,183
I've been that before.

545
00:26:59,183 --> 00:27:02,398
Let's go back to this story
and then I'll keep jumping.

546
00:27:02,398 --> 00:27:03,802
This is how I roll.

547
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:06,984
My first meeting first one ever
first one, start the company we

548
00:27:06,984 --> 00:27:09,092
land Campbell's Soup.

549
00:27:09,092 --> 00:27:09,862
I'm gonna put them on Facebook.

550
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,196
They're like, "What's Facebook?"

551
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,498
I'm like, "This is perfect.

552
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:13,499
"This is my world."

553
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:14,433
I go into my first meeting.

554
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:16,969
It's a V-8 juice, you
guys have V-8 here?

555
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,770
Good V-8 fucking juice meeting.

556
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,940
I sit down, it's an
IMC or something.

557
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,309
All the fucking
agency partners, right?

558
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:24,977
I sit down.

559
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,111
I'm super pumped.

560
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:29,181
I promise myself I'm going to
shut up which is rare for me I

561
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:30,949
need to learn I need to
shut my fucking mouth.

562
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:31,783
I'm gonna listen and learn.

563
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:34,019
So I don't say a god
damn thing and here we go.

564
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,788
First comes up the PR company.

565
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:41,193
Just a recap, "Great news, we
got 987 trillion impressions for

566
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:45,397
"you last month," because they
got a mention on Huffington Post

567
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:48,066
seventh page in, bottom
left-hand corner but you know

568
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:51,103
they give the credit for
the entire monthly reach of

569
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:53,338
HuffPo.com for their metrics.

570
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:57,075
So that started off tough
but 800 drillion impressions,

571
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,744
everybody claps.

572
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:02,180
Then somebody comes up, whether
creative shop or somebody else

573
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,949
they did something, they showed
some creative and they go,

574
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:06,685
"Great news, Millard Brown,"
I had never heard that word

575
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,254
before, "Millard Brown says
it's the greatest shit

576
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,292
"that ever happened."

577
00:28:10,292 --> 00:28:13,225
Yay, everybody claps. Right?

578
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:16,795
The activation agency comes up
and goes, "Great news we went to

579
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:20,198
"the NCAA tournament and we gave
out a bunch of fucking soup and

580
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,134
"we got 700 drillion
people to try it."

581
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:24,736
I'm like this is
an amazing world.

582
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:27,539
Somehow they figured out how
many people actually tried the

583
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,475
soup by giving out samples yet
every event I've ever given to

584
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:33,212
all the fucking samples are on
the ground but cool unbelievable

585
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:37,182
7 million people I tried
fucking V-8 soup. Great.

586
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,951
Now I'm getting antsy because

587
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:41,286
this is why failed 
everything in school.

588
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:45,924
I basically just went to
the last page which said the

589
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:49,828
business is down 19%.

590
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:53,432
So finally four different people
present, the digital shop comes

591
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:55,200
up and honestly you
know what's funny?

592
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,004
I will take as much as I just
railed on television commercials

593
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:03,008
if you call it that I will take
a TV commercial over 90% of the

594
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:05,677
bullshit digital
shit that people sell.

595
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:09,648
Pre-roll, banner, takeover
stuff that nobody wants.

596
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:11,717
I would call those
impressions that are negatives.

597
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:15,988
When we going to start, by the
way real quick just as a side

598
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:17,222
note, as a tidbit.

599
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:20,058
Can we start debating the
value of an impression?

600
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:23,428
Why is everybody
predicated on the impression.

601
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,130
Impressions can be bad.

602
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,264
Awareness can be bad.

603
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,167
Everybody knew who
Hitler was, that wasn't good.

604
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,869
Impressions can be bad.

605
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:34,406
I will never buy a Samsung
product because they kept doing

606
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:37,676
pop up banner ads on ESPN.com
that annoyed me so much and by

607
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:39,011
the way you guys know this on

608
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:41,780
mobile devices those 
little x's are small.

609
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,548
And our thumbs are big.

610
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:47,886
So those hundred impressions
that I by accident clicked into

611
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:51,189
seven times back at
Group M everyone's like 7%.

612
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,991
(high five's himself)
(laughter)

613
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:56,428
Meanwhile, I will never buy a
Samsung, I mean literally the

614
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:57,996
seventh time I called 
my wife and said,

615
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,998
"I swear, when I die 
you can remarry.

616
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,833
"You could do whatever the
fuck you want but nobody in his

617
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,935
"family while I'm
alive buys Samsung."

618
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,960
(laughter)

619
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,741
It's true.

620
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:13,512
I finally raise my hand to the
Campbell's meeting I go, listen,

621
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:14,980
I come from an
entrepreneur land.

622
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,648
I come from running
my own businesses.

623
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,516
I'm missing something.

624
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,751
I know this is $1 billion
companies I don't want to deploy

625
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:23,321
my hundred million dollars
business mentality but I've got

626
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,958
to ask I've just sat through
this meeting and I know and I

627
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,895
was I'm self-aware I was like
look I know this is going to be

628
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:32,130
who the fuck is this
guy and what the fuck?

629
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:32,798
Right?

630
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:34,933
I have to ask
because I have to learn.

631
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:38,413
How can we have such a
compelling meeting for 45

632
00:30:38,413 --> 00:30:41,440
minutes where everybody did
everything right and why is the

633
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,675
business down 19%?

634
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,878
And no joke this is my
first corporate America meeting

635
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:49,157
advertising big brand meeting
everybody in their goes

636
00:30:49,157 --> 00:30:50,654
"Yeah, fucking confusing."

637
00:30:50,654 --> 00:30:52,262
(laughter)

638
00:30:52,262 --> 00:30:54,169
And I was like holy shit.

639
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:58,044
I literally said could we debate

640
00:30:58,044 --> 00:31:01,662
the metrics that you
guys score on?

641
00:31:01,662 --> 00:31:05,366
And that was it that was the
beginning of a six year period

642
00:31:05,366 --> 00:31:08,461
where I've come to
realize, you can't.

643
00:31:08,461 --> 00:31:13,130
Once the organization decides to
accept ACE testing, do you guys

644
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,010
know this ACE testing thing?

645
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,808
My ABI client does that.

646
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,368
They make a commercial and then

647
00:31:18,368 --> 00:31:20,263
they have to run it 
through an ACE test.

648
00:31:20,263 --> 00:31:25,945
Which is something out of a 1927
sci-fi movie and that justifies

649
00:31:25,945 --> 00:31:28,496
what sees television.

650
00:31:28,496 --> 00:31:32,430
I know I'm saying
it wrong Animanic?

651
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,696
Yeah.

652
00:31:33,696 --> 00:31:37,420
Pictures, stuff
that makes no sense.

653
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,158
It's stuff that makes no sense.

654
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:43,942
And so, I don't know I'm
confused but not confused

655
00:31:43,942 --> 00:31:49,030
meaning there's a reason, you
know because I spend a lot of

656
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:52,005
time on startup land I would
tell Dove and Johnson &amp; Johnson

657
00:31:52,005 --> 00:31:54,690
clients, I'm like hey you
gotta look out for Method.

658
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,724
Hey, you gotta look
out for Honest Company.

659
00:31:56,724 --> 00:31:59,419
These things are happening
and they would laugh them out.

660
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:03,706
When Dollars Shave Club's video,
bless you,

661
00:32:03,706 --> 00:32:06,596
went viral I think 
that's like television.

662
00:32:06,596 --> 00:32:08,351
That is a lot of video views.

663
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:11,373
I called Gillette people because
I was very friendly with the

664
00:32:11,373 --> 00:32:13,047
former CEO and I said you
got to take a look at this.

665
00:32:13,047 --> 00:32:16,030
They literally, this is not a
joke, they literally laughed me

666
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,430
off the call.

667
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,586
And now of course there's
the Gillette Shave Club.

668
00:32:21,586 --> 00:32:23,573
Right?

669
00:32:23,573 --> 00:32:28,163
I don't understand why we look
at the marketing behaviors of an

670
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:31,560
Airbnb or an Uber or all the
startups that really go from 0

671
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:37,223
to $300, $800, $900 million in
sales and they act one way and

672
00:32:37,223 --> 00:32:41,313
then we all sit on pieces of
businesses that act a different

673
00:32:41,313 --> 00:32:43,278
way and they
continue to decline.

674
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:44,959
They're all declining.

675
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:47,643
Everybody's like how?

676
00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:50,634
And it's the same thing that
happens in American politics.

677
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,004
I kept making videos I'm like
Obama's gonna win, Obama's gonna

678
00:32:54,004 --> 00:32:58,370
win, Obama's gonna win 'cause he
did surgical digital marketing

679
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,028
and everybody's like no.

680
00:33:00,028 --> 00:33:01,646
And then he won and now
everyone's like Trump,

681
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,647
how did this happen?

682
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,818
Because he actually went to
where people's attention is.

683
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,286
It's just attention.

684
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:10,322
My friends, the only thing
you're in here, the only

685
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,157
business you're in 
here is attention

686
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,459
and then your part starts.

687
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:15,193
And then your part starts.

688
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:19,898
And then is your story, is your
copy, is your art compelling

689
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:21,233
enough to sell?

690
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:25,003
But my creatives are happy with
me because we have a process now

691
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,607
where we do 4 to 7 commercials
for a client, test them at scale

692
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:31,670
and then whatever wins you know
the person that actually wants

693
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:35,714
to buy stuff reacts to, that
gets to the light of day but can

694
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:38,350
you imagine, can you imagine
what's happened in our four

695
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,485
walls for the creatives that
have worked in shops like this

696
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,588
for the last 10 years to
actually have their idea see the

697
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:46,124
day of light because we also

698
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,059
built an internal
production house.

699
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,628
We drive down the costs.

700
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:54,199
There's a way to make a
$400,000 video for $190,000.

701
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,267
You hack at it.

702
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:58,036
You find the inefficiencies in
what the market's done and all

703
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,405
of a sudden when you do that and
all of a sudden you convince a

704
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,041
client to spend media
efficiently there's a couple

705
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,443
dollars left over for creative.

706
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:08,280
All of a sudden you got all four
stories and then interesting

707
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,150
things happen, for example we
ran a piece of content that

708
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,219
starred African-American
families and then targeted

709
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,857
African-American families on
Facebook and a remarkable

710
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:21,561
thing happened, it worked.

711
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:23,495
In the US there's a
channel called BET.

712
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:27,376
African-Americans watch more of
that because they star in it.

713
00:34:27,376 --> 00:34:31,036
We run Asian-Americans on
certain stuff and they watch it

714
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:34,005
because when you see yourself
within the creative it works.

715
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,507
And on television
everything's vanilla.

716
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:39,277
Because you have to make it for
everybody and then every slogan

717
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,812
is like just do it.

718
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,380
Or for the good of it or yeah.

719
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,951
Everything's fucking vanilla.

720
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:49,387
I couldn't imagine, as I've
gotten to know you guys better

721
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,456
this is the only world you
should give a shit about.

722
00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:55,893
This is the world that gives
you the opportunity to do you.

723
00:34:55,893 --> 00:35:01,266
Instead of complete vanilla
blunt wide objects that strip

724
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:04,769
all the shit that you
have in your heart.

725
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,904
So, I don't know.

726
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:08,340
I think the golden era of
creative's coming and I think it

727
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,709
comes in the form of Facebook
and it makes me laugh because

728
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:13,478
all my creatives hat have
been doing it for 12 to 20 years

729
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:16,715
poo-poo it and think it's shit
and think it's third tier and

730
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:19,217
fucking bush league because they
don't know what the fuck they're

731
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,906
talking about. That's why.

732
00:35:22,766 --> 00:35:25,490
And so I don't know it's going
to be fun to watch of the next

733
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,892
10 years. I know this.

734
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:32,998
I know that we've never seen the
friction between big brands and

735
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:35,300
their media buying agencies like
we've seen over the last three

736
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,702
years because they're starting
to wake up and realize the two

737
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:40,839
biggest margin areas for media
buying agencies are television

738
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:43,541
and programmatic ad buying
and ironically that's the only

739
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,411
fucking thing that
they tell them to do.

740
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:47,779
I know that.

741
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:50,715
And I know that that's going
to change where dollars get

742
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,418
allocated and how they're
going to get allocated.

743
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:55,787
And I know that we have a whole
generation of people that are

744
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:58,156
not going to be rewarded for
doing the thing that doesn't

745
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,091
get them fired.

746
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,727
I'm religious about attention.

747
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:05,096
I couldn't imagine selling
something to an 18-year-old in

748
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:08,486
America and not spending 80% of
my money on Snapchat creative.

749
00:36:08,486 --> 00:36:09,567
Why?

750
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,703
They don't spend
another minute anywhere else.

751
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:12,804
Why in the world?

752
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:15,173
I don't give a shit 
what your reports say or

753
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,574
what you grew up with.

754
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:20,211
The market is the market is
the market and I'm telling you

755
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,581
especially if you love
advertising, please go study

756
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,484
what happened from 1955 to 1965

757
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:27,886
in the US market
I can speak for.

758
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:30,488
I'm not quite as sure here of
the timing or if that's exactly

759
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,823
what happened but
I'm sure it is.

760
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:35,593
Because when the collective of
our society's attention shifts

761
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:40,398
platforms, carnage 
and opportunity

762
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:41,766
happen at the same time.

763
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:45,203
The four biggest beer brands in
America all collapsed because

764
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,672
they were romantic about radio.

765
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:50,475
Because there was creatives at
the shops that loved writing

766
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:54,979
copy for radio and didn't give a
shit about this 30 second video

767
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:59,466
bullshit on this black-and-white
thing that nobody's gonna watch.

768
00:36:59,466 --> 00:37:00,452
That's why.

769
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,787
That's exactly what's
happening right now.

770
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:03,855
And here's the punchline and

771
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:05,857
I'll go in to Q&amp;A please go
to any detail.

772
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:07,859
I did talk a lot about social
but if you want to talk about

773
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:11,529
Musically or Anchor or Snapchat

774
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:13,531
or whatever you 
like to talk about.

775
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,203
It was romance that put
everybody out of business.

776
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:19,404
And the thing that bothers

777
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:22,440
me about romance is it
lacks practicality.

778
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,276
I hate when I go and speak of
these companies or agencies and

779
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:29,581
they go "He's a disruptor," and
"He's a real disruptor here he

780
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,949
is Gary," and I get up 
there and I'm like,

781
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:33,818
"I'm not a fucking disruptor.

782
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:37,055
"I'm the most practical
fucking guy in this room."

783
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:39,457
You know what I think is
disruptive, trying to sell a

784
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:42,293
25-year-old in 2016 something

785
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,829
through a fucking
television commercial.

786
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,732
That's disruptive,
that's fucking insanity.

787
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,034
And you know what bothers me the
most, and I'll end with this,

788
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:53,638
you know this when you walk
out of this fucking hall.

789
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:54,672
You know this.

790
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:58,109
It's what you do every
fucking day as a normal human.

791
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,944
It's what your parents
are doing every day.

792
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,547
You see it right in your face
but because this is what you do

793
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:05,383
for a living you trick yourself

794
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,051
when you walk 
through these doors.

795
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,753
That's wrong.

796
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,121
It just is.

797
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,457
It just is.

798
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:13,158
Thank you.

799
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:16,948
(applause)

800
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:28,373
What is your name, my man?

801
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:30,508
- [Man] What's the
average age of your employees?

802
00:38:32,548 --> 00:38:36,082
- The last the average age
of VaynerMedia, so we're 650

803
00:38:36,082 --> 00:38:40,321
people, I would say the
average age is probably 28.

804
00:38:40,321 --> 00:38:45,314
And only in the last 150
employees did we even hire

805
00:38:45,314 --> 00:38:49,594
anybody over 35 because so
there's a couple of advantages,

806
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:52,597
I don't run on any margin.

807
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:54,599
That helps me do good work.

808
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,901
I can make $400,000 videos for

809
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,937
$180 because 
I don't run any margin.

810
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:00,905
The reason I don't run any
margin just to get to the real

811
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:03,074
punchline for you guys, I think
you might find it fascinating is

812
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:06,177
I want to build a private equity
business on top of my agency, so

813
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,446
I still want by the New York
Jets I just don't want to open a

814
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,181
4,000 liquor stores.

815
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:14,886
My belief is that we, all of
us in advertising, I guess is

816
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:17,021
Ogilvy the 50% of my
money I'm wasting.

817
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,591
I truly in my heart
think it's 90% now.

818
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:23,695
And in that arbitrage 
I think I can buy brands.

819
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,898
And market them the right
way and make a lot of money.

820
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:30,568
If you know who 3G the private
equity firm that bought ABI and

821
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:33,805
bought Heinz, I want to
build the reverse of that.

822
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:36,407
What they're good at is they buy
a business and they strip it.

823
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:39,077
They bought Burger King 
and had 1400 employees

824
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,545
and now they have 30.

825
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,646
They do that kind of shit.

826
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,735
They print on both sides of the
paper, the CEOs flies fucking

827
00:39:43,735 --> 00:39:45,984
coach middle seat.

828
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:48,195
That's what they do.
Cool.

829
00:39:48,195 --> 00:39:50,788
As an immigrant I
respect the shit out of it.

830
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:51,756
My whole career has

831
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:54,611
been predicated on
growing businesses.

832
00:39:54,611 --> 00:39:58,029
We're young because I couldn't
afford to pay anybody, you know.

833
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:02,233
We've grown a lot, we did
$3,000,000 48 months ago.

834
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,769
You can't afford this kind of

835
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:08,106
talent on that kind 
of top line revenue.

836
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:10,675
Over the last 15, 18 months
we've started being able to

837
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:13,645
afford people and it's
been super interesting.

838
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:16,748
And it's gotten older but the
truth is we just hired our chief

839
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,316
creative officer, right?

840
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:20,919
Started literally nine days ago.

841
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,787
He was at Crispin
Porter for six years.

842
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,690
I spent six months trying to
find the person and this is the

843
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:29,661
order of what mattered to me
first emotional intelligence.

844
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:31,129
When I tell you that I don't

845
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:33,498
respect talent it 
would upset you.

846
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:37,435
It's stunning when I run my
business how secondary pure

847
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,937
talent is to people skills.

848
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:44,509
This notion that some creative
is so fucking special that they

849
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:47,045
can be a douche bag and fuck
up the entire place is the

850
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:50,281
stupidest shit I've
ever heard in my life.

851
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,650
And I'm very unpopular in
tech-land, I did it again at

852
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,485
South-By where I was
like fuck Steve Jobs.

853
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:58,323
I don't want to run a business
where being mean brings

854
00:40:58,323 --> 00:40:59,223
the best out of.

855
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:01,225
I don't give a shit if
you're a creative genius.

856
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,294
Fucking act like a
normal person you asshole.

857
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,330
(laughter)

858
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:09,834
So first I'm always scared of
that we have unbelievable my C,

859
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:14,036
CIO, but he's really our COO my
brother is my CEO partner but

860
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:18,785
James Orsini he was the CFO
and CEO of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and

861
00:41:18,785 --> 00:41:22,480
he's been in that ecosystem for
25 years, when he came and saw

862
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,818
our voluntary turnover rate he
was like, "What are you doing?"

863
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,052
He knew our salaries were in

864
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,787
line it wasn't 
anything like that.

865
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:32,657
I'm like what we're doing is
we're an HR driven organization

866
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,593
because I believe
continuity trumps everything.

867
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:38,996
Continuity you know it's just
like sports a team that stays

868
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,292
together usually beats a team
with superstars that were put

869
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:43,167
together for one season.

870
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,268
And I believe that.

871
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:46,037
And I love continuity at Vayner.

872
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:48,239
We have enormous continuity
already for a young company and

873
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,641
I want to keep it
forever because I give a shit.

874
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,877
Rhys is now living in London,
she's going to be part of the

875
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:55,146
London team because four years
ago when she started working at

876
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:56,101
Vayner I'm like
"What do you want?"

877
00:41:56,101 --> 00:41:57,125
She's like "I want
to be in London."

878
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:58,340
I'm like, "Cool, if we ever go
there, you'll go there,"

879
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,817
and then I did it.

880
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:04,088
And by the way, I don't care
if you're driven by money or by

881
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:08,459
work-life balance or by creative
output I individually at 650

882
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:11,462
care about what you care about
and I also know when you get

883
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:14,004
married you're going to
care about different shit.

884
00:42:14,004 --> 00:42:15,099
We're an HR driven organization.

885
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,001
I needed to find a CCO that

886
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,804
understood that so 
that was a challenge.

887
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:22,945
Especially when you're looking
for them and I was looking for

888
00:42:22,945 --> 00:42:26,989
somebody more like this
because I wanted to taste what a

889
00:42:26,989 --> 00:42:32,417
seasoned veteran from a Wieden
from a Crispin looked like.

890
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:35,086
What did that feel
like internally?

891
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:39,223
Number two I wanted somebody who
is religious about attention and

892
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,193
not the platform he or
she was storytelling on.

893
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:46,164
The level of romance in this
industry of which platform your

894
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:51,636
storytelling on is laughable
at best and insane at worst.

895
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:52,703
Like really?

896
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:56,874
You'd really rather have it on
fucking BBC during a segment

897
00:42:56,874 --> 00:43:01,712
then have 50 times more people
in the world see it, really?

898
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:02,947
Why?

899
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:04,482
Because you were told that.

900
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:07,452
Because that's what's
rewarded in the current moment.

901
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:09,954
The problem is, what pisses
me off is, I have so much

902
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:12,723
compassion for
everybody, you guys are young.

903
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,058
You really think the industry is

904
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,927
going to reward that
in 7 to 10 years?

905
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:19,597
You think as the Ubers and the
Airbnbs become the Mastercards

906
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,366
and the Procter &amp; Gambles
that they're going to want your

907
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,769
talent when you
were that religious?

908
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,071
So I sit on panels with all
these hot shot young creatives

909
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:29,207
I'm like, "Dude, you're fucking

910
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:32,172
"you're on the record
you're fucked.

911
00:43:32,172 --> 00:43:33,229
"You're dead."

912
00:43:33,229 --> 00:43:35,179
What are you doing, right?

913
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:39,650
So we're young but
quickly growing older.

914
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,686
Cliché right?

915
00:43:41,686 --> 00:43:44,689
To me, it's really really
not an age thing truly.

916
00:43:44,689 --> 00:43:47,775
Because I was stunned by how
much Steve Babcock's religion

917
00:43:47,775 --> 00:43:49,627
was about wherever.

918
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:53,297
I think if you find the purest
form creative that has more

919
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,300
practical business DNA then 
just somebody who wants to

920
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,401
get their nut off.

921
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:01,372
There's just so many creatives
that just want to get it done.

922
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:04,342
Because TV's where the budget is
right now and I always wanted to

923
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:05,810
blow up a rock so they're like

924
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,378
fuck it that's where 
I want to be.

925
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,847
If you're religious about
getting your story out to the

926
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:14,085
world and you actually have any
practitioner-ship understanding

927
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:15,686
of what's happening right now

928
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,021
there is no debate 
for that person.

929
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:19,758
We're getting older but that
doesn't scare me because I'll be

930
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:25,196
honest with you I can think of 3
to 4 strategy creative people in

931
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:28,112
the organization that are lets
call it 40 and above who I think

932
00:44:28,112 --> 00:44:30,635
are more in tune to what's
actually going on than a lot of

933
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:32,842
my 26-year-olds.

934
00:44:32,842 --> 00:44:34,605
A lot of my 26-year-olds still

935
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,607
grew up wanting to 
be on Adage's top.

936
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:40,945
One of my kids ran up to me he's
like, "We made GE," GE's been a

937
00:44:40,945 --> 00:44:42,947
brand that's gotten a lot of
credit for a lot of work that

938
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:44,482
we've done over
the last five years.

939
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:47,018
He's like, "We made it on
AdAge's top 10 hit list."

940
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,153
And I'm like,
"The fuck is that?"

941
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:51,776
He's like, "I've always wanted
to be on it," and I was pumped

942
00:44:51,776 --> 00:44:53,491
for him because I grew up
wanting to the in the

943
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:55,459
Wine Spectator and 
I have empathy.

944
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,161
If this is your craft, if
this is what you always knew,

945
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:58,796
If you're dad or mom did this.

946
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:02,667
I don't want to destroy that, 
I just want people to understand

947
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:04,936
it's dangerous to be, the
quickest way to go out of

948
00:45:04,936 --> 00:45:08,306
business is to be romantic
about how you make your money.

949
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:10,975
It's the quickest way.

950
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:13,791
Listen, guys I wish, I didn't
get to tell the full story,

951
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:19,684
I built my library on direct-mail,
outdoor, radio local television,

952
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:22,386
full-page ads in the New York
Times and Wall Street Journal.

953
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,622
I wish that
marketing didn't change.

954
00:45:24,622 --> 00:45:26,958
I had it figured out.

955
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:29,393
I had 1.2 million
followers on Twitter.

956
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,494
Do you know how sad I am

957
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:32,863
that Twitter's fucking
losing attention?

958
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:34,098
Fucking work seven years

959
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:37,130
answering all your
fucking questions.

960
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:40,104
I'm pissed but it doesn't 
change the fact that

961
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:41,672
that's what is happening.

962
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:44,175
And so if I have to stay up 'til
three in the morning to figure

963
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:48,980
out how Musically works because
60 million, 60 million people

964
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:52,500
are using it monthly from 0
seven months ago and if I want

965
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,387
to sell a 16-year-old
something, I need to know.

966
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:58,589
Just need to know.

967
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,625
My man? What's your name?

968
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:02,827
Scott.

969
00:46:02,827 --> 00:46:07,833
- [Scott] Do you think
social platforms (inaudible).

970
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:09,900
- 100%. Yeah.

971
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,570
I will literally walk back in
here for years now and be like

972
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:15,799
you guys are doing
Facebook you fucking idiots.

973
00:46:15,799 --> 00:46:18,376
100%. Absolutely.

974
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:21,045
It's why I've been such a big
advocate of Facebook because out

975
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:23,914
of all the people I've ever
met my life, forget about in

976
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:26,717
business, in my life I truly
believe that Mark Zuckerberg

977
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:28,819
understands EQ more than any.

978
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:31,922
It's so funny because the movie
really did a number for him

979
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,090
in a good way.

980
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:34,592
They made him, 
the whole story is,

981
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:36,260
he didn't build Facebook 
for a girl.

982
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,129
Hollywood is so
fucking interesting.

983
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:41,332
Anyway.
(laughter)

984
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:44,268
His emotional intelligence 
is so extreme,

985
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:46,070
it's how we became 
friends back then.

986
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,271
It's how I got in.

987
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:49,206
Because he was able to
tell this guy gets it.

988
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:51,809
In a way that he, you know?

989
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:55,079
The reason the algorithm was
so brilliant is the only thing

990
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:57,048
Zucks gives a shit
about is attention.

991
00:46:57,048 --> 00:46:58,315
It's why he bought Instagram.

992
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,118
This is good, Piers Morgan 
a London guy, good.

993
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:04,789
I was on CNN the day Facebook
bought Instagram for $1 billion

994
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:07,070
because six months
earlier News Corp.

995
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:09,660
another one they had "The
Daily" remember "The Daily"?

996
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,798
I did a show on a "The Daily"
once a week about business stuff

997
00:47:13,798 --> 00:47:14,799
and tech stuff.

998
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:16,894
I had a prediction show at the
end of the year and I predicted

999
00:47:16,894 --> 00:47:20,538
Facebook would buy Instagram so
four months later they buy it.

1000
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:23,741
And I get to be on CNN
with Piers and talk about it.

1001
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:25,176
And I go that they stole it.

1002
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:28,098
And I don't know if you remember
this, this is two years ago.

1003
00:47:28,098 --> 00:47:30,314
Instagram was 551 days old.

1004
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,917
And they spent $1 billion on it.

1005
00:47:32,917 --> 00:47:34,518
People lost their shit.

1006
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,587
A lot of people in America and 
the world didn't even know what

1007
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:39,423
Instagram was yet and $1
billion is a lot of money.

1008
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,659
And it was a lot of money two
years ago compared to today,

1009
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:42,993
just the way the world works.

1010
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:45,062
And I go on the show
and go he stole it.

1011
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:48,833
I get out of the studio and
there's thousands of people

1012
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:50,768
saying I'm an idiot on Twitter.

1013
00:47:50,768 --> 00:47:54,772
I saved every one of them
when WhatApp was bought for $18

1014
00:47:54,772 --> 00:47:57,341
billion ironically when I'm on
vacation in Turks and Caicos

1015
00:47:57,341 --> 00:48:00,845
with my wife and the first day I
laid on the beach pulled up all

1016
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:04,915
those tweets and replied to
every single person on Twitter

1017
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:07,150
and said, "Now what bitch?"

1018
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:10,354
But the reason I predicted that
Zucks bought Instagram and the

1019
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:13,077
reason Mark Zuckerberg, think
about this guys, Mark tried to

1020
00:48:13,077 --> 00:48:18,729
buy Snapchat for $3
billion 18 months ago.

1021
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,399
The one thing he understands
better than anybody executing

1022
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:24,769
right now is
attention is the only asset.

1023
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:26,670
And so he keeps trying 
to buy the thing that

1024
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,139
will arbitrage him out.

1025
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:30,348
If Facebook did not own
Instagram today, there'd be a

1026
00:48:30,348 --> 00:48:33,344
lot more friction and tension
about it's health but because

1027
00:48:33,344 --> 00:48:35,880
they have another
five years behind that.

1028
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,916
And if they fucking had
Snapchat fucking forget it.

1029
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:39,583
Right?

1030
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:43,521
I think Evan had the benefit of
being rich so he didn't sell and

1031
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:45,823
two he had good intuition.

1032
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,658
And he believes in attention
too if you look at the way the

1033
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:50,494
product's built on both those
front this what I yelled about

1034
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:52,062
Twitter in 2011.

1035
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:53,898
I'm like change the firehose.

1036
00:48:53,898 --> 00:48:55,866
People's attention
is gonna go away.

1037
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:57,468
Create an algorithm.

1038
00:48:57,468 --> 00:49:00,638
These algorithms work
because they keep us on it.

1039
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:04,542
There's a reason Google created
a promotion tab on Gmail.

1040
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:05,633
The data was going in the wrong

1041
00:49:05,633 --> 00:49:09,013
direction 'cause we'd
ruined email.

1042
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:12,516
So yes, I do think that we, me
I spend every minute trying to

1043
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:15,152
ruin Snapchat and Musically.

1044
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:15,853
Yes, I do.

1045
00:49:15,853 --> 00:49:18,689
I think that's what happens
unless these platforms are smart

1046
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:23,027
enough to create different ad
units that don't steal our time

1047
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:24,862
or don't push
stuff we don't want.

1048
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:29,667
Facebook wins because their data
is so insane that I believe that

1049
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:32,710
if advertisers actually got the
shit together we could save our

1050
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:37,341
industry because I actually want
root beer and Lionel Richie and

1051
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:41,779
New York Jets ads in my Facebook
and what's really interesting is

1052
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:44,281
Facebook is trying to figure
this out so many of the media

1053
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:47,484
buying companies are such douche
bags they want to buy Facebook

1054
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,688
in TV like behavior instead of
what they should be doing which

1055
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:53,624
is creating 25 different
cohorts, then giving it to you

1056
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:56,994
and now if you know that you're
going after a single mom with

1057
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:01,498
three kids that all like
basketball that live in Ireland

1058
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,601
think about what you're going 
to make creatively versus

1059
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:05,703
if you're going after moms.

1060
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:07,371
Think about that.

1061
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:10,941
Think about the creative freedom
and volume of different stories

1062
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:11,876
we could tell.

1063
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:14,645
Think about when I just did that
for you versus going moms where

1064
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:15,913
your head went.

1065
00:50:15,913 --> 00:50:18,115
How many more things you could
be doing, the kind of stories

1066
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:19,016
you can be telling.

1067
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:24,088
Yes, I do but I do think at
least Mark as such a young CEO

1068
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:27,691
of such a big company will be
doing behavior for a long time

1069
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,127
that may educate future
platforms and it'll be

1070
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:31,929
interesting to see
where it shifts.

1071
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:34,965
Absolutely I do not think
social is on a pedestal, if I was

1072
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:37,935
here in 2000 I'd be like
guys this Google Adwords thing,

1073
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:39,637
search, right?

1074
00:50:39,637 --> 00:50:43,263
I'm always trying to put
myself out of business.

1075
00:50:43,263 --> 00:50:44,140
Every day.

1076
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:48,646
I'm always everyday waking up
and saying is this is why I'm

1077
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:52,850
heavily after Twitter was what
built me it's where I came from

1078
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:53,884
for this world.

1079
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,686
It's been the thing that I've
been railing on the most for the

1080
00:50:55,686 --> 00:50:57,988
last 12 months even though those
are my best friends, even though

1081
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:00,090
I made millions of dollars on
it, even though I'm sitting on

1082
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,692
millions of dollars in stock.

1083
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:04,728
My reputation of being right is
the only asset and I think it's

1084
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,464
completely fucking broken.

1085
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:09,375
My man? What is your name?

1086
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:11,109
- [Will] Will.
- Will.

1087
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:16,673
- [Will] (inaudible) media
agency (inaudible) media buying

1088
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:20,077
whatsoever.
- We do.

1089
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,146
As I'm getting more educated
about this industry I realized

1090
00:51:22,146 --> 00:51:25,149
oh wow this is how they
used to do it back in the day.

1091
00:51:25,149 --> 00:51:28,152
I think that's right and in
our world when you're making 26

1092
00:51:28,152 --> 00:51:31,188
different segmentations and 26
different creative stories we

1093
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:32,389
have to sit together.

1094
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:36,360
My teams where we and it's funny
in a world of OMD and Group M

1095
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:41,932
and StarCom, we've chipped away
and have won Quaker just gave us

1096
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:45,589
the social media buying duties
even though OMD is the global

1097
00:51:45,589 --> 00:51:50,841
agency because we're just able,
in any bake-off of something

1098
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:54,311
that shows a quantifiable sale
including bullshit metrics like

1099
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:57,448
impressions and click-through
like marketing jargon we win

1100
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:00,517
every time because the
creative is the variable.

1101
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:01,185
Right?

1102
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:06,690
And so you guys are at the mercy
of some big buying, it's crazy

1103
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,158
to do it that way.

1104
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:11,595
It happened because in 1991
Martin Sorrell realized he could

1105
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:14,999
make more margin by
separating this shit.

1106
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:16,166
This is what pisses me off.

1107
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:20,251
I knew nothing, it takes me 20
fucking minutes as a commonsense

1108
00:52:20,251 --> 00:52:23,415
businessman to figure out why this
shit happens and then everybody

1109
00:52:23,415 --> 00:52:27,011
goes award-winning
work sells product.

1110
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:28,312
That's my favorite by the way.

1111
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:29,680
I'm sure that
gets said here too.

1112
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,682
And definitely gets said
in Cannes 5,000 times.

1113
00:52:31,682 --> 00:52:33,984
Award-winning
work sells product.

1114
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:38,389
You mean the studies that were
commissioned by Nielsen's and by

1115
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:42,026
creative shops 25 years
ago to justify creative?

1116
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:45,863
Why is everybody so confused?

1117
00:52:45,863 --> 00:52:48,565
Yes, we absolutely do
the buying when we can.

1118
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:51,239
Some places we can't do it
because were boxed out by the

1119
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:53,370
AOR media buying company.

1120
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:56,607
But what's great is we'd rather
lose the business and continue

1121
00:52:56,607 --> 00:52:59,910
to push against it to prove it
to them eventually willing our

1122
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:04,014
way to an A/B test which I don't
know miraculously we're like 20

1123
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,718
for 20 because when two human
beings are sitting next to each

1124
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:11,021
other and one is saying
okay this is going to go 23 to

1125
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,691
27-year-old females who are fans
of Burberry and who've commonly

1126
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:17,795
gone to Bergdorf Goodman, the
creative has a little bit of an

1127
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:21,398
advantage over the people
that are going 18 to 60-year-old

1128
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:23,232
females, go.

1129
00:53:23,232 --> 00:53:26,765
So yes we think that
that's going to happen.

1130
00:53:26,765 --> 00:53:29,339
I think that will happen to
you guys over the next 10 years

1131
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,141
'cause there'll be no options.

1132
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:32,976
You'll be forced to, I don't
know if you guys are owned by

1133
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:35,612
holding company or not,
you're an independent.

1134
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:38,115
You'll build out that principle
or merge with somebody.

1135
00:53:38,115 --> 00:53:40,984
It's just going to be important.

1136
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,419
People are going
to follow dollars.

1137
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:45,189
Dollars are going
to shift over time.

1138
00:53:45,189 --> 00:53:48,082
And again I actually think
there's a huge pot of money in

1139
00:53:48,082 --> 00:53:49,626
just programmatic banner.

1140
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:52,596
The funny thing is ironically
especially given the energy

1141
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:55,199
I came in with I'm not trying to
convince most of my clients to

1142
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:56,433
stop doing television.

1143
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:58,235
I think that's a golden
goose that most people are

1144
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,536
too romantic about.

1145
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:01,205
I'll let that play itself out.

1146
00:54:01,205 --> 00:54:05,642
I'm actually chipping away at
banner programmatic because that

1147
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:10,753
shit they don't
like and it so crazy.

1148
00:54:10,753 --> 00:54:13,684
When's the last time, when's
the last time somebody clicked

1149
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:16,253
a banner ad?

1150
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:19,890
There's amazing case studies of
people not even seeing banner

1151
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:24,294
ads like being blind to it now
left sides of websites a lot of

1152
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:27,464
UX UIs designers I don't
know there's any in here are

1153
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:31,101
designing the most least, least,
least important thing on the

1154
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,804
left side of website because
they know that we've become

1155
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:37,741
literally blind to that spot
on the right side or left side

1156
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:41,812
depending on the market because
that's where the ads were.

1157
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:44,314
Literally the Facebook
generation the 33-year-olds kind

1158
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:47,951
of right now, 27 to 33 literally
can't see the right side of a

1159
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,447
website because that's where the
Facebook ads were for the five

1160
00:54:50,447 --> 00:54:51,355
years they were there everyday.

1161
00:54:51,355 --> 00:54:52,789
They literally cannot recall.

1162
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,792
Cannot recall.

1163
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,729
Yes sir. What is your name?

1164
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:00,230
- [Rob] Rob.
- Rob.

1165
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,169
- [Rob] What's your tip
for the next biggest thing?

1166
00:55:02,169 --> 00:55:04,238
You talked about
Snapchat, what's next?

1167
00:55:04,238 --> 00:55:06,069
- You know what's funny?

1168
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:08,369
I always so viscerally push
against this the way to my

1169
00:55:08,369 --> 00:55:10,974
brand's positioned in the little
circles that know who I am.

1170
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:14,994
I don't predict.
I don't know.

1171
00:55:14,994 --> 00:55:18,092
- [Rob] What'd you invest in?

1172
00:55:18,092 --> 00:55:20,117
(laughter)

1173
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:23,720
- So there's four
companies, here's my process.

1174
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,790
I've been watching
Snapchat for 3 1/2 years.

1175
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:31,562
I got vocal about a 2 1/2 years
ago this last holiday season

1176
00:55:31,562 --> 00:55:33,864
December, January 
I got very loud because

1177
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:35,265
I felt it went normal.

1178
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:38,502
Meaning I now do feel based on
the metrics I see that we have

1179
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:41,905
tipped over and 30 and 40 and
50-year-olds will be on Snapchat

1180
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:44,174
in the next 12 to 24 months.

1181
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,475
The four platforms that I'm

1182
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:47,477
paying attention to are 
all very different.

1183
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:50,013
I'm looking at Peach 
because Dom Hoffmann

1184
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,748
is a very good product guy.

1185
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:55,085
But Peach is
fucking 41 days old.

1186
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:58,502
It can't even begin to be
meaningful for a year and

1187
00:55:58,502 --> 00:56:01,525
I actually am not very
crazy about excited about it.

1188
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:04,328
Anchor. Anchor is
like a voice Twitter.

1189
00:56:04,328 --> 00:56:05,696
I don't know if you seen Anchor.

1190
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:06,697
Super interesting to me.

1191
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:09,299
I've always wanted it
because a lot of thoughts.

1192
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:12,169
I've always thought
voice Twitter was real.

1193
00:56:12,169 --> 00:56:14,004
So this is the closest thing
I've seen to voice Twitter,

1194
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:15,739
it's called Anchor.

1195
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:18,110
I'm watching that.

1196
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:21,045
Musically is the first platform
that I've seen that has the true

1197
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:23,914
potential to be
the next Snapchat.

1198
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:26,116
If you don't know what Musically
is you should definitely

1199
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:26,783
download it.

1200
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:29,419
It's very interesting. 
Based in China.

1201
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:32,589
But exploded in the US and
the UK and other markets.

1202
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,258
If you go into your...

1203
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:35,626
Who's Apple here versus Android?

1204
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:37,094
Apple?

1205
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:39,763
Just do me one favor, you'll be
so much smarter for doing it.

1206
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:43,600
Every morning open up 
the free app top 150 apps

1207
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,401
and look at the charts.

1208
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,500
It is pure data of where
people's attention is.

1209
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,673
You'll go there and you'll see
Musically is ahead of Twitter

1210
00:56:49,673 --> 00:56:52,676
for the last 30 days and
then you'll say, "What's that?"

1211
00:56:52,676 --> 00:56:54,211
and then you'll download it.

1212
00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:56,513
And then you'll consume it
and then you'll have ideas.

1213
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:58,615
It's a good idea, so
Musically is super interesting.

1214
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:04,454
Musically, Anchor, Peach, After
School's interesting to me.

1215
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:05,856
It's starting to
explode in the US.

1216
00:57:05,856 --> 00:57:08,325
You can only get in to
it with a high school ID.

1217
00:57:08,325 --> 00:57:09,842
Reminds me a lot of Facebook

1218
00:57:09,842 --> 00:57:11,207
where you can 
only get in with...

1219
00:57:11,207 --> 00:57:14,231
So that's gotten some traction
so I'm paying attention.

1220
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:15,332
So I watch things.

1221
00:57:15,332 --> 00:57:18,635
The thing that I do well though
and where I've been able to make

1222
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:25,242
reputation is back to not being
a disruptor, I'm practical.

1223
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:28,979
I'm able to invest in things
when they've already won yet the

1224
00:57:28,979 --> 00:57:30,547
market hasn't accepted them.

1225
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:34,451
So when Vine popped what I did
was I just didn't go to sleep

1226
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:38,388
until 3 o'clock in the morning
for a month because I'm busy but

1227
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:40,757
every night from midnight to
3 o'clock in the morning I

1228
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:44,194
literally looked at everything
I listen with my eyes.

1229
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:46,530
I just looked at everything
that people were doing.

1230
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:48,999
And I created an account
and I started playing.

1231
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:52,736
I think the key to a lot of this
is so you know how many of you

1232
00:57:52,736 --> 00:57:55,806
have an opinion on Snapchat 
and Snapchat advertising

1233
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:57,808
and don't use it?

1234
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:00,209
That to me is a problem.

1235
00:58:00,209 --> 00:58:02,913
You know how many meetings I've
been in with creative shops and

1236
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:05,449
digital shops and they say
something about Facebook

1237
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:06,550
that isn't true.

1238
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:09,319
That isn't true.

1239
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:13,724
So my big advantages is that
some actual practitioner versus

1240
00:58:13,724 --> 00:58:15,492
a headline reader.

1241
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,361
As somebody who's
really deeply in it.

1242
00:58:17,361 --> 00:58:21,865
Every day on Digiday and AdAge
and PR Week and Adweek every

1243
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:26,470
day there are multiple headlines
and articles that are inaccurate

1244
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:28,939
or that there's quotes
from people that have vested

1245
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:31,675
financial interest for
that thing not to happen.

1246
00:58:33,777 --> 00:58:37,614
So I'm an investor in
Meerkat and wrote a huge check.

1247
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:39,315
I think it's dead.

1248
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:41,944
My vested interest in predicated
on being right so that you guys

1249
00:58:41,944 --> 00:58:44,221
invite me back to
sit here again.

1250
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:47,591
So I think that people are very
shortsighted and it's fine when

1251
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:50,293
the market doesn't change for
20 or 30 years you can be a

1252
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:52,829
political animal
and ride your career.

1253
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:55,365
The problem is this
market isn't that.

1254
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:59,669
Nothing that is
important existed 11 years ago.

1255
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:01,571
Not the smart phone, not
Youtube, not Facebook, not

1256
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:04,641
Twitter, not Instagram,
not Snapchat, nothing.

1257
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:06,900
And nobody here
retires in 12 years.

1258
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,607
The fuck you think
is going to happen?

1259
00:59:09,607 --> 00:59:11,515
(laughter)

1260
00:59:11,515 --> 00:59:13,650
This is my point to a lot of
the youngsters that come in.

1261
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:15,919
Let me tell you what I'm
referring to because I'm not

1262
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:17,287
being very frank with you.

1263
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:20,090
I sit on panels in all these
fancy fucking places now ANA,

1264
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,458
IRR, fucking Cannes, right?

1265
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:24,261
And I listen to people and I get
to know them because were in the

1266
00:59:24,261 --> 00:59:27,564
green room for coffee for
an hour before the panel.

1267
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,900
And then eventually you're out
at the fucking Facebook party

1268
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,769
and you see that person and you
get a drink and it's blown me

1269
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:37,174
away how many of these people
when you get a couple cocktails

1270
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:41,578
in to them say to me things
like, "Gary, you're right."

1271
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,680
(laughter)

1272
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,815
And I'm like cool.

1273
00:59:44,815 --> 00:59:48,285
Here's the part that bothers me
the most, you're so young you

1274
00:59:48,285 --> 00:59:51,855
just stood in front of the
entire industry all that video

1275
00:59:51,855 --> 00:59:54,658
is being recorded and in seven
years when you're trying to get

1276
00:59:54,658 --> 00:59:57,394
a job at some other place
that now is built on this thing,

1277
00:59:57,394 --> 00:59:59,996
they're going to be like
this guy is a fucking idiot.

1278
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:02,132
Why are you doing that?

1279
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:04,501
How many of you saw
"The Big Short" the movie?

1280
01:00:04,501 --> 01:00:06,803
Raise your hands
I'm just curious.

1281
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:08,776
I swear to God when I watched
that movie I was like,

1282
01:00:08,776 --> 01:00:11,842
"Holy shit, this is the
advertising industry."

1283
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:13,577
Everybody knows it.

1284
01:00:13,577 --> 01:00:16,112
And everybody's in on it.

1285
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,714
And I'm not mad.

1286
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:18,381
I'm really not.

1287
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:20,984
Even though comes it
comes with a lot of angst.

1288
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:23,186
People are doing what's
right for themselves, I get it.

1289
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:26,456
I'm disappointed because 
I wish I could tell everybody

1290
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,824
how this plays out.

1291
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:31,294
Because when market change, the
rules change and then what you

1292
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:34,498
thought we were doing the safe
thing for yourself, you were

1293
01:00:34,498 --> 01:00:36,782
actually doing the
dangerous thing.

1294
01:00:41,128 --> 01:00:42,057
Any other questions?

1295
01:00:42,057 --> 01:00:43,252
Yeah.

1296
01:00:43,252 --> 01:00:48,604
- [Man] Mark Zuckerberg 
plugging Samson.

1297
01:00:48,604 --> 01:00:52,189
He's kind of doubling down on
the whole VR thing as being a

1298
01:00:52,189 --> 01:00:54,439
thing for the
future of Facebook.

1299
01:00:54,439 --> 01:00:56,820
How do you feel about that?

1300
01:00:56,820 --> 01:01:01,124
- VR is 100%, not
99, the next platform.

1301
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:03,434
The problem is it's much 
further away than a lot of the

1302
01:01:03,434 --> 01:01:05,962
tech nerds think.

1303
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:10,901
What I learned with the
internet, VR is internet 1991.

1304
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:15,038
So I'm investing
heavy in VR only B to B.

1305
01:01:15,038 --> 01:01:17,807
Of the companies I think will
get bought by Google, Apple,

1306
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:19,809
Samsung and Facebook.

1307
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:22,245
Consumer VR is not even close.

1308
01:01:23,865 --> 01:01:26,449
We couldn't even get ourselves
to where Google Glasses,

1309
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:27,450
we're gonna go to VR?

1310
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:32,022
I think VR hits critical mass
when it goes to contact lenses

1311
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:34,824
and it's a good 10, 12, 15
years from now but we'll start.

1312
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:37,994
Gaming, movies everybody in here
in five years will probably put

1313
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:39,629
on a VR set and watch a movie.

1314
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:43,433
Everybody in here in 5 to 7
years will play video game in VR

1315
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:46,937
but the thought that VR is as
close as people think it is it's

1316
01:01:46,937 --> 01:01:48,338
not on the consumer level.

1317
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:52,142
Because people are grossly,
grossly underestimating what

1318
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:55,612
makes the fashion industry
tick and how consumer behavior

1319
01:01:55,612 --> 01:01:57,747
actually works.
It takes time.

1320
01:01:57,747 --> 01:02:00,216
It takes time from anthropology
standpoint we're further away

1321
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:02,352
than we think but
it will happen.

1322
01:02:02,352 --> 01:02:04,955
Because here's why I
think it is going to happen.

1323
01:02:07,591 --> 01:02:11,201
I, very young in my age,
realized holy shit I am a focus

1324
01:02:11,201 --> 01:02:14,664
group of one like everybody
else but I'm such a consummate

1325
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:17,534
salesman and was built that
with such a young age there's

1326
01:02:17,534 --> 01:02:20,000
something that I am that 
I don't really give a fuck

1327
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,838
about my own opinions.

1328
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:26,209
I just try to map what is in
this weird spot in my stomach.

1329
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:29,245
It blew me away when I did the
VR for the first time, not too

1330
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,214
long ago, the real VR that's
coming kinda some

1331
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:32,215
of the preview shit.

1332
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:35,518
I took the headset off after an
hour now mind you I want to give

1333
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:38,421
you a little context, nobody
loves people more than me.

1334
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:41,024
You can be tied with me but
I love human interaction.

1335
01:02:41,024 --> 01:02:43,063
So funny social media when
that was being debated,

1336
01:02:43,063 --> 01:02:45,629
that's a gateway drug to
actual communication.

1337
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:51,001
I love this.
Love it.

1338
01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:54,685
I took the headset off and
literally subconsciously which

1339
01:02:54,685 --> 01:02:58,842
was the part that kind of took
me aback, I took it off and said

1340
01:02:58,842 --> 01:03:02,592
why would anybody ever take this
off and it fucked with me,

1341
01:03:02,592 --> 01:03:03,880
It still kinda fucks with me.

1342
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,083
Because I like was like fuck if
that was my purest reaction to

1343
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:12,155
myself the whole thought of
what's real life and what's not

1344
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:14,991
feels very real because if you
really think about it, if you

1345
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:18,928
really look at a 15, 17,
19-year-old is the life that are

1346
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:21,628
living in our phone more 
or less real the life of the

1347
01:03:21,628 --> 01:03:22,666
living out here?

1348
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:24,901
There's some crazy
ass shit coming.

1349
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:26,803
I think he's betting
because he bets long-term.

1350
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,605
He can afford to.

1351
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:32,108
But I'm not expecting all of us
sitting at home being actually

1352
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:35,111
here right now anytime soon.

1353
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:36,713
But we'll all see it.

1354
01:03:36,713 --> 01:03:38,530
I think we we'll all see it.

1355
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:40,216
Yeah man.

1356
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:42,865
- [Man 3] (inaudible)

1357
01:03:42,865 --> 01:03:44,880
- I don't. No, I don't.

1358
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,524
I'll tell you why, 
I don't judge humans.

1359
01:03:47,524 --> 01:03:49,526
We have a good track record.

1360
01:03:50,276 --> 01:03:51,220
I think human beings are the

1361
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:53,485
most underrated 
brand in the world.

1362
01:03:53,485 --> 01:03:57,341
I think that if we took your
great, great, great, grandfather

1363
01:03:57,981 --> 01:04:01,504
pulled him up revived him, made
him fresh and sat him here and

1364
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:05,408
let him watch everything we
do, he'd be really fucking sad.

1365
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:08,511
I think that if you take
generations, I mean there was a

1366
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:11,981
time only 40 years ago that
people felt that Elvis shaking

1367
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:13,450
his hips was the devil.

1368
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:16,886
I think it's evolution.

1369
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:19,956
I actually, I'm very actually
very happy about technology.

1370
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:20,857
let me explain.

1371
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:25,061
The cliché current version of
sad in the following you go out

1372
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:27,597
with your partner and you go
to a restaurant and you see a

1373
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:29,529
couple sitting there having
dinner and both of them are on

1374
01:04:29,529 --> 01:04:31,067
the phone the whole time.

1375
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:34,037
And you judge, because we
love to judge, don't we?

1376
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,072
You look at somebody
and you go that's sad.

1377
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:37,240
Look at those two.

1378
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,641
They fucking on the
phone and whole time.

1379
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:39,776
That's sad.

1380
01:04:39,776 --> 01:04:43,747
I see the following looking
around for most of you are old

1381
01:04:43,747 --> 01:04:46,416
enough to remember going to
the restaurant 10 years ago and

1382
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:49,753
seeing a couple that sat across
from each other and didn't say a

1383
01:04:49,753 --> 01:04:53,456
fucking word to each
other the entire dinner.

1384
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:56,436
So what I see is that same
couple 10 years later and

1385
01:04:56,436 --> 01:04:58,428
I'm happy for them 
because unlike--

1386
01:04:58,428 --> 01:04:59,095
(laughter)

1387
01:04:59,095 --> 01:05:01,030
I am. I'm being dead serious.

1388
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:04,000
Unlike 10 years ago where they
had to like this and fucking be

1389
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,404
miserable now they have
options to be happy at least.

1390
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,106
I really don't, 
I don't think it is sad.

1391
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:13,877
I think people take the half
glass empty point of view on a

1392
01:05:13,877 --> 01:05:15,245
lot of these issues.

1393
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:19,916
If you look at data of average
14-year-old girl in America she

1394
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,168
now claims to have many more
friends than she did just 10

1395
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:25,188
years ago because if you're
introverted or kind of little

1396
01:05:25,188 --> 01:05:28,925
bit different 14-year-old girl
in America 12, 15 years ago and

1397
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,501
probably all over the world
and the serendipity of the high

1398
01:05:31,501 --> 01:05:35,298
school that you're in didn't
give you the fucking luck of

1399
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:37,967
having another friend or two
that had those interests, you

1400
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:41,004
are isolated but now you
have unlimited options.

1401
01:05:41,004 --> 01:05:44,073
Through your phone or
through Twitch and video games.

1402
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:46,409
There's a lot of healthy
things that are happening.

1403
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:52,248
Maybe I'm an optimist but the
reason I'm not scared or sad is

1404
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:54,851
'cause we proven for a
very long time to adapt.

1405
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:56,319
Evolution is real.

1406
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,521
We're going to become robots.

1407
01:05:58,521 --> 01:06:00,123
People can think it
is sad, I get it.

1408
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:01,524
You know, it's different.

1409
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:04,799
A lot of people think that
interracial marriages are sad.

1410
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:08,378
A lot of people think that
way girls are dress are sad.

1411
01:06:08,378 --> 01:06:11,411
There's a lot of things that
are sad. Men aren't men anymore.

1412
01:06:11,411 --> 01:06:12,696
The great
generation we're tough.

1413
01:06:12,696 --> 01:06:14,426
We're metrosexual.

1414
01:06:14,426 --> 01:06:17,234
I think a lot of
things are judged.

1415
01:06:17,234 --> 01:06:19,609
I don't judge the way
that we communicate.

1416
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:22,312
We've evolved go read what we
wrote about the telephone and

1417
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:26,983
the television and video games
and cell phones, evolution baby.

1418
01:06:29,619 --> 01:06:31,588
Yes.

1419
01:06:31,588 --> 01:06:36,313
- [Man 4] I know you don't
predict but do you think that in

1420
01:06:36,313 --> 01:06:41,972
our future that people, you
know, that classic form of being

1421
01:06:41,972 --> 01:06:45,635
together with
somebody (inaudible).

1422
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:47,991
- I'd be lying--

1423
01:06:47,991 --> 01:06:49,860
- [Man 4] It's tiring, isn't it?

1424
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:51,574
(laughter)

1425
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:56,512
- There's a lot if you want to
go really up there's is a couple

1426
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:58,581
things I think are really
interesting that are going to

1427
01:06:58,581 --> 01:06:59,682
change our relationships.

1428
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:03,086
Number one, I think
that it's hard to hide.

1429
01:07:05,356 --> 01:07:08,442
There's a female researcher at
MIT that really blew my mind

1430
01:07:08,442 --> 01:07:13,563
about the notion of 
marriage being built on the

1431
01:07:13,563 --> 01:07:15,598
shadows of society.

1432
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:17,334
Her thesis I can't remember 
her name I want to give it

1433
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:18,251
to you guys.

1434
01:07:18,251 --> 01:07:21,738
Her thesis was the marriage was
able to be executed was there

1435
01:07:21,738 --> 01:07:23,339
was a lot of secrecy.

1436
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:27,343
And if you look at her theory
on 1920s, '30s, '40s, '50s

1437
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:30,914
housewife just looking the other
way and then evolution as women

1438
01:07:30,914 --> 01:07:32,749
became more equals of just

1439
01:07:32,749 --> 01:07:34,584
cheating but not being
exposed, hiding.

1440
01:07:34,584 --> 01:07:37,921
And as we go into a world
where it's just hard to hide.

1441
01:07:37,921 --> 01:07:40,657
Completely and everything's
being documented as privacy goes

1442
01:07:40,657 --> 01:07:43,092
less and less away
what happens to that.

1443
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:46,996
I think back to VR there's
some incredible thinking around

1444
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:50,099
what's going to happen would
with VR porn that I think is,

1445
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:51,301
it's just true.

1446
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:53,002
They're the fastest
innovators in the space.

1447
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:56,072
VR makes your brain
think you're 99% there.

1448
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:59,359
What happens for men with 
porn that think is 99% real

1449
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,877
in a VR environment?

1450
01:08:00,877 --> 01:08:05,871
I think back to your thing
for us to think that shit's not

1451
01:08:05,871 --> 01:08:09,526
gonna change and not gonna
change aggressively with very

1452
01:08:09,526 --> 01:08:11,301
different technologies,

1453
01:08:11,301 --> 01:08:13,528
yeah I think a lot of 
things are gonna change.

1454
01:08:13,528 --> 01:08:17,593
But I would also tell you and
again, may be predicated on the

1455
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:22,365
optimism, I think the more
that the more that we expose the

1456
01:08:22,365 --> 01:08:26,636
shadows that we may not see it
'cause it takes a long time but

1457
01:08:26,636 --> 01:08:29,604
if you think about, I'll
actually give you a

1458
01:08:29,604 --> 01:08:30,872
focus group of one.

1459
01:08:30,872 --> 01:08:33,977
As I started getting internet
fame and realizing more my shit

1460
01:08:33,977 --> 01:08:37,145
was going to be out there 
I took selfies on the way here,

1461
01:08:37,145 --> 01:08:38,314
people in street.

1462
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:39,881
I've lived a different way.

1463
01:08:39,881 --> 01:08:44,386
It's interesting how freeing it
can be if you kind of, no joke

1464
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:47,523
as a real funny where I'm trying
to get to I literally live my

1465
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:51,361
life at this point as if
it's on the record 24/7.

1466
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:53,763
I'm conditioning myself for
knowing that all of you are

1467
01:08:53,763 --> 01:08:56,399
going to wear contact lenses
in 10 years and you could be

1468
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,667
streaming that or recording it.

1469
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:00,737
This is real.

1470
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:04,040
You can wish how it's not gonna
be but these things are coming

1471
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:07,944
and so I don't know exactly how
to answer your question of like

1472
01:09:07,944 --> 01:09:09,578
what's going to happen but I
definitely think there's

1473
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:10,816
gonna be friction.

1474
01:09:10,816 --> 01:09:14,716
I think the way things are now
are being challenged not just in

1475
01:09:14,716 --> 01:09:18,821
television ads versus Facebook
stream versus Snapchat but in

1476
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:21,890
like all social norms 
and you know

1477
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:23,893
it's just a different world, man.

1478
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:28,631
One more. My man.

1479
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:30,308
How are you?

1480
01:09:31,497 --> 01:09:32,789
Yep.

1481
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:36,706
- [Man 5] I'm obviously‚..
(inaudible) A lot of that is

1482
01:09:36,706 --> 01:09:38,608
going to change.

1483
01:09:38,608 --> 01:09:43,702
You talk a lot about EQ.
(inaudible) hustle.

1484
01:09:46,631 --> 01:09:48,048
Gist about that.

1485
01:09:48,049 --> 01:09:49,652
- Thank you for knowing that.

1486
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:51,854
Yeah, one thing 
I didn't touch on that

1487
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,189
I appreciate you alluding to.

1488
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,748
I think this is been a very
big reason we were able to grow

1489
01:09:56,748 --> 01:10:01,264
VaynerMedia and I think as you
get bigger it gets harder and

1490
01:10:01,264 --> 01:10:02,865
just in general.

1491
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,634
For people that know a
little bit about me.

1492
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:09,305
Being an immigrant I don't think
I have all that many talents.

1493
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:12,241
But what I definitely know more
than anything is that hard work

1494
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:14,243
is an absolute variable.

1495
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:18,014
I think way too many people,
this whole notion of well Gary I

1496
01:10:18,014 --> 01:10:22,018
work smart and that somehow
substitutes working hard is

1497
01:10:22,018 --> 01:10:23,086
really quite silly.

1498
01:10:23,086 --> 01:10:26,622
I think it breeds itself in
talented organizations like

1499
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:30,864
this, and startups where one
thinks their talent can trump

1500
01:10:30,864 --> 01:10:32,675
somebody outworking them.

1501
01:10:32,675 --> 01:10:35,780
For example,
creative is subjective.

1502
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:37,574
Delivering
something on time is not.

1503
01:10:38,874 --> 01:10:41,006
And so these are things that we
kind of think a whole lot about.

1504
01:10:41,006 --> 01:10:44,723
I think no question in a
world where a lot of stuff being

1505
01:10:44,723 --> 01:10:47,818
commoditized because of the
scale of the infrastructure of

1506
01:10:47,818 --> 01:10:53,850
society that hard work is a
stunning variable but it's only

1507
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:57,887
hustle to what you actually
want to happen in your life.

1508
01:10:57,887 --> 01:11:01,190
So the cliché way I talk about
it is I work 15 and 17 hours a

1509
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:03,593
day because I have
these business ambitions.

1510
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:06,763
But I would argue I had a very
telling meeting the other day

1511
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:09,832
where I have a friend who is
made over $100 million and he's

1512
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:13,102
sitting there and he's crying
and complaining to me that he

1513
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:16,639
doesn't spend the time with his
family and I was like literally

1514
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:18,274
I had no love for him and he's
a real good friend and

1515
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:19,509
I'm like, "Fuck you."

1516
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:20,877
You have nothing but money.

1517
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:22,778
You're not doing it for that.

1518
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,647
You're being selfish you want
to spend time with your family,

1519
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:26,745
spend more time
with your family.

1520
01:11:26,745 --> 01:11:29,117
Hustle can come
in a lot of forms.

1521
01:11:29,117 --> 01:11:31,053
It depends on what
you want to deploy it.

1522
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:34,123
But if you want to be great at
your craft if you want to be

1523
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:38,361
great at what you do
professionally to even begin to

1524
01:11:38,361 --> 01:11:41,430
think in today's environment
that you can pull that off an

1525
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:43,065
eight hour day is laughable.

1526
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:44,467
It is just not real.

1527
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:48,204
And so I'm a very, very,
very big believer in hard work

1528
01:11:48,204 --> 01:11:51,507
because I think it is
the differentiation in the

1529
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:52,241
marketplace.

1530
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:55,805
If talent was enough all the
number one draft picks and all

1531
01:11:55,805 --> 01:11:59,615
these sports leagues they would
win and all these different

1532
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:02,251
artists that have
music talent would win.

1533
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:05,704
Hustle I think is the backbone
of how we built what we built.

1534
01:12:05,704 --> 01:12:09,192
It was funny as we started
hiring older people, you know,

1535
01:12:09,192 --> 01:12:10,193
I'm busy.

1536
01:12:10,193 --> 01:12:13,296
So I'd have meetings at 8 or 9
PM at the office that's when I

1537
01:12:13,296 --> 01:12:18,634
can meet them and I knew I was
onto something as I was starting

1538
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:22,014
to hire more senior people
because every one of them were

1539
01:12:22,014 --> 01:12:25,031
on the floor stunned how
many fucking people were at the

1540
01:12:25,031 --> 01:12:27,009
VaynerMedia at
8:30 at night working.

1541
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,278
And they would always
comment on like,

1542
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:30,213
"Holy shit. Huh?"

1543
01:12:30,213 --> 01:12:33,516
And the truth is and this is not
a joke I do feel like our hustle

1544
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:38,087
at 650 and 100 million and a
little bit of love finally is

1545
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:39,188
coming down a little bit.

1546
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:45,795
Success absolutely
pushes against hustle.

1547
01:12:45,795 --> 01:12:48,998
One of the reasons I'm doing my
daily vlog and documenting it is

1548
01:12:48,998 --> 01:12:52,301
to remind all these fuckers
that hard work is a factor.

1549
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:54,503
So. Thank you 
guys for having me.

1550
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:57,142
(applause)

1551
01:12:57,142 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.
