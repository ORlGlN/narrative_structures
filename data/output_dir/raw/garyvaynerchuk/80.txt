1
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:08,633
(piano music)

2
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:16,323
- What's interesting
about fear and excuses

3
00:00:16,323 --> 00:00:18,124
is if you reverse-engineer them backward

4
00:00:18,124 --> 00:00:20,332
to the seed of where it's coming from,

5
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:22,573
it means that a stunning
majority of the people

6
00:00:22,573 --> 00:00:24,130
in this audience

7
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,489
are actually tied up

8
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:30,819
in caring about somebody
else's point of view on them

9
00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:34,178
and I'm really fascinated by that.

10
00:00:34,178 --> 00:00:36,565
Fear's holding you back,
you know what you wanna do.

11
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:37,586
The only reason you're doing it

12
00:00:37,586 --> 00:00:38,551
is 'cause you're scared of doing

13
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:39,881
what you actually wanna do.

14
00:00:39,881 --> 00:00:41,990
So what are you scared of, failing?

15
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,381
- [Man] Not failing but

16
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:47,726
still being at the same
place when my friends are

17
00:00:47,726 --> 00:00:48,818
at the next level.

18
00:00:48,818 --> 00:00:50,290
- Huge mistake.

19
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,538
You don't want the same
thing your friends want.

20
00:00:52,538 --> 00:00:54,625
So why (bleep) do you what they have?

21
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:55,976
Number one mistake so many people make

22
00:00:55,976 --> 00:00:58,387
is they care about what other people have.

23
00:00:58,387 --> 00:01:00,128
I don't (bleep) what anybody has.

24
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:02,126
If I have more, if i have
less, doesn't matter.

25
00:01:02,126 --> 00:01:03,774
I worry about myself.

26
00:01:03,774 --> 00:01:04,607
The fact that you're worrying about

27
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:07,395
other people's accomplishments
is already a losing formula.

28
00:01:07,395 --> 00:01:08,344
You need to get rid of that first

29
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:11,094
then you could focus on yourself.

30
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:16,183
I would argue that well
more than 50% of the people

31
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:18,740
in this audience are here today

32
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,849
because they worry about
the way they would be judged

33
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,131
by one and or two family members

34
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:26,886
in their inner seven, eight people circle.

35
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:30,102
If you're not feeling
it, find new friends.

36
00:01:30,102 --> 00:01:31,582
I'm being dead serious about this.

37
00:01:31,582 --> 00:01:33,430
This one is real big for me.

38
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,437
Who you hang out with is a huge deal

39
00:01:35,437 --> 00:01:36,977
and again, these are all
tried and true things, right?

40
00:01:36,977 --> 00:01:37,971
We've heard the,

41
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:39,978
you're the whatever of the
five friends you spend like,

42
00:01:39,978 --> 00:01:40,997
that's real.

43
00:01:40,997 --> 00:01:43,760
Add one new winner friend.

44
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,054
Like you know what I mean?

45
00:01:45,054 --> 00:01:48,273
Add one new winner friend
and cut one loser friend.

46
00:01:48,273 --> 00:01:50,915
Like yeah I know he's been
your boy since fourth grade

47
00:01:50,915 --> 00:01:54,958
but he sits at home and smokes
weed and plays 2K all day.

48
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,958
Like, you can only love 'em so much.

49
00:01:59,824 --> 00:02:02,199
And to me, that is the
most fascinating thing

50
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:04,833
that's happening as I'm
going through my journey

51
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,541
which is, "Oh."

52
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,541
The reason I

53
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,941
am capable and have the
luxury of standing up here

54
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:16,258
is that my parents parented me in a way

55
00:02:16,258 --> 00:02:20,175
that gave me so much
self-esteem while respect.

56
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,027
When I was nine years
old and opened the door

57
00:02:25,027 --> 00:02:27,806
for an elderly woman at a McDonald's,

58
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:31,639
she reacted as if I won
the Nobel Peace Prize.

59
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:34,588
What my mom did was super smart.

60
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:38,280
She overreacted on
everything that I was doing

61
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,986
that was a good human trait.

62
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:43,757
My mom built huge self-esteem in me

63
00:02:43,757 --> 00:02:45,563
and I feel like the biggest reason

64
00:02:45,563 --> 00:02:47,672
I am who I am today to everybody

65
00:02:47,672 --> 00:02:50,956
is 'cause I feel so guilty and so grateful

66
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:52,553
for what she did for me

67
00:02:52,553 --> 00:02:54,495
that I wanna do it for everybody else.

68
00:02:54,495 --> 00:02:55,586
Which is guess what?

69
00:02:55,586 --> 00:02:57,156
You suck at a ton of (bleep)

70
00:02:57,156 --> 00:02:59,278
Good, so does everybody else.

71
00:02:59,278 --> 00:03:01,581
You're also probably pretty
(bleep) rad at something.

72
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,895
Try as many things as possible

73
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:05,416
until you figure out what
you're rad at and you like,

74
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,537
and go (bleep) do that
for the rest of your life

75
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:11,142
and stop giving a (bleep)
about everybody else.

76
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:12,778
There's this an incredible,

77
00:03:12,778 --> 00:03:15,176
you know, like kind of
access point of like

78
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:16,979
what you're great at and what you love.

79
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:20,729
When you stumble into
being somebody like me,

80
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:22,993
you really win.

81
00:03:22,993 --> 00:03:25,060
When what you're naturally great at

82
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,297
is what you naturally love the most

83
00:03:27,297 --> 00:03:28,414
and away you go.

84
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:31,041
And so I think what you need
to do is taste everything.

85
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,047
It's kind of like food.

86
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:33,456
You don't know what
your favorite food is if

87
00:03:33,456 --> 00:03:35,263
you only eat one food.

88
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:36,955
So I would take advantage of your youth

89
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:40,493
and your flexibility at this kind of age

90
00:03:40,493 --> 00:03:43,714
and try to taste everything,
play with everything,

91
00:03:43,714 --> 00:03:45,255
figure out what you might be good at,

92
00:03:45,255 --> 00:03:49,338
what you might like and
then you make a decision.

93
00:03:51,738 --> 00:03:53,794
It's a very fine balance.

94
00:03:53,794 --> 00:03:55,403
I don't stand up here not giving a (bleep)

95
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:57,542
about what people think about me.

96
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:58,525
It's just that,

97
00:03:58,525 --> 00:03:59,852
I care just a little more about

98
00:03:59,852 --> 00:04:04,019
what I think about myself
than everybody else combined.

99
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:11,142
And I just think a lot
of people are crippled by

100
00:04:11,142 --> 00:04:15,101
going on the offense
because we are sold defense.

101
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:16,863
We are sold defense.

102
00:04:16,863 --> 00:04:17,987
We just are.

103
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:20,029
Offense is always the best defense.

104
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,990
Offense always solves problems

105
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,933
as long as your defense is
not a complete disaster.

106
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:27,884
So I just think offense
is a very good mentality.

107
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:29,042
There is a trigger mindset.

108
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:30,746
I'm always trying to stay on offense.

109
00:04:30,746 --> 00:04:32,659
Same (bleep) I always say.

110
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:35,005
Same (bleep) I hear
from everybody who wins.

111
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:39,203
You know, I think the
fear of losing trumps

112
00:04:39,203 --> 00:04:41,945
the excitement of victory
for so many people.

113
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:43,514
I think people are so scared.

114
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:46,055
Nobody wants the rejection.

115
00:04:46,055 --> 00:04:47,733
Nobody wants to lose.

116
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:50,112
So, I understand the philosophy.

117
00:04:50,112 --> 00:04:52,135
I understand that string of DNA

118
00:04:52,135 --> 00:04:54,885
that doesn't wanna make you lose.

119
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:59,390
But I'm so desperate to figure out

120
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,730
how to convince people that

121
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,403
there is no loss in going for it.

122
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:07,068
That, yeah you might get made fun of

123
00:05:07,068 --> 00:05:09,716
and you might have it in your own mind but

124
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:11,240
trying to figure out how to make people

125
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,518
drop that fear of going and building

126
00:05:13,518 --> 00:05:17,131
a business for themselves in 2012.

127
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:19,665
Trying to figure out how to make a video

128
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:22,665
or a give a talk or send a tweet

129
00:05:22,665 --> 00:05:23,498
or

130
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,888
write a book.

131
00:05:25,888 --> 00:05:28,502
Just something that makes
people understand that

132
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:30,478
executing the way it always is

133
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:31,732
is gonna lead you to a place

134
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,915
where you're not going to win.

135
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:35,191
Life's funny bro.

136
00:05:35,191 --> 00:05:37,555
And I think that a lot of people

137
00:05:37,555 --> 00:05:39,769
are sitting here for
another reason in those two.

138
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:42,165
Fear, judgment of others.

139
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:44,819
This one I'm obsessed with
if you're following me

140
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:47,491
and I just think most
of you lack patience.

141
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:50,320
I tell these 23 year olds,
26 year olds all the time

142
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,219
to be patient because they should.

143
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,318
How old are you?

144
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:54,776
- 44.

145
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:55,609
- I'm 40.

146
00:05:56,532 --> 00:05:59,058
Do you know how young we feel?

147
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,141
It's,

148
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:03,316
when you were 26, did you ever think

149
00:06:03,316 --> 00:06:05,078
that this is what 44 felt like?

150
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:05,911
- No.

151
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:07,393
- You thought that that was finished.

152
00:06:07,393 --> 00:06:08,226
- Yeah.

153
00:06:08,226 --> 00:06:09,434
- Like, you think of 40 year olds,

154
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:10,783
when I was 25 years old,

155
00:06:10,783 --> 00:06:13,294
I thought a 40 year old was finished.

156
00:06:13,294 --> 00:06:15,715
I don't even feel like I'm starting.

157
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:18,045
It's a balance of regret and patience.

158
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,533
Like you can go hard on for three years,

159
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:24,364
do nothing right, wake
up and be young (bleep)

160
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:26,416
You should really go to
a retirement home one day

161
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,284
and volunteer and just talk to them.

162
00:06:28,284 --> 00:06:31,424
It will make you wanna use
(bleep) every minute of your life

163
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,580
because when you see
regret in a man's eyes,

164
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,150
it's (bleep) painful

165
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,770
because you can't do (bleep) about it.

166
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,018
When you're 90 and you're not mobile

167
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:43,048
and you're tired and it's over,

168
00:06:43,048 --> 00:06:45,020
you can't do any, you can't do it.

169
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,570
You can't build that company you wanted.

170
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,435
You can't spend that time with your kid.

171
00:06:48,435 --> 00:06:49,768
It's regret.

172
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:52,908
And that (bleep) drives
the (bleep) out of me.

173
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:55,480
I think that patience

174
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,865
has been the disproportionate
component of my success.

175
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:00,259
- So what should we do, Gary Vee?

176
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:01,092
Let's wrap this up.

177
00:07:01,092 --> 00:07:01,984
What should we do?

178
00:07:01,984 --> 00:07:03,315
What should people do?

179
00:07:03,315 --> 00:07:05,099
- People should stop complaining.

180
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:05,932
- Right, good call.

181
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:07,620
People should figure out
who the (bleep) they are.

182
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,453
- Good call.

183
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:11,016
- People should not listen
to America propaganda

184
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:12,809
of fixing the (bleep) they suck at.

185
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:15,508
They should be tripling down
at what they're good at.

186
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:17,938
They should be competent in certain areas

187
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,151
but you're not gonna become Beyonce

188
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:24,547
or you know, like your bone
structure is a certain way.

189
00:07:24,547 --> 00:07:25,907
Like you're not gonna solve everything.

190
00:07:25,907 --> 00:07:28,195
Your IQ can get a little bit better

191
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:30,008
but don't worry about the incremental.

192
00:07:30,008 --> 00:07:32,280
Figure out what puts you on fire

193
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,024
and you're halfway decent at.

194
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:36,062
If you're lucky enough
right now to be listening

195
00:07:36,062 --> 00:07:38,960
and you're good at what you like,

196
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,811
become tunnel (bleep) vision.

197
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:43,186
Because there's way too many voices

198
00:07:43,186 --> 00:07:45,684
telling you what and how
and here's the other thing

199
00:07:45,684 --> 00:07:46,781
and this is the big one, Joe.

200
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:48,247
Have the conversation

201
00:07:48,247 --> 00:07:50,138
with the person that's holding you back.

202
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:52,112
The reason most people who
are listening right now

203
00:07:52,112 --> 00:07:53,819
are not doing that thing,

204
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,058
is they're worried about
the opinion of somebody.

205
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,258
Usually, their mother.

206
00:07:58,258 --> 00:08:00,292
Usually, their father.

207
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:03,266
And the reality is, is that your spouse

208
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:04,870
may be the person holding you back

209
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,309
and you have to have that conversation.

210
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:07,144
- Cut 'em off.

211
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:09,908
- We have to get to a place
where you're doing you

212
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:11,500
because the number one thing

213
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,156
that scares the (bleep)
out of me is regret.

214
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:15,865
And you're gonna sit there at 72

215
00:08:15,865 --> 00:08:18,176
and you're gonna say,
I wish, I wish, I wish

216
00:08:18,176 --> 00:08:19,135
and whether that's money

217
00:08:19,135 --> 00:08:20,371
or spend more time with your family,

218
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:22,015
there's a million ways to do this.

219
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,481
Not everybody wants to buy the Jets.

220
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:26,829
Not everybody wants to smoke
weed on the beach in Bahamas.

221
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:28,868
Like, everybody's got a
different (bleep) thing.

222
00:08:28,868 --> 00:08:30,296
Figure out what your (bleep) thing is

223
00:08:30,296 --> 00:08:32,520
and stop making (bleep)
bull(bleep) excuses.

224
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,784
Who the president is, your mom did this,

225
00:08:34,784 --> 00:08:36,376
like, like, I missed it,

226
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:38,085
I had that idea for Uber.

227
00:08:38,086 --> 00:08:39,994
Then why didn't you (bleep) do it?

228
00:08:39,994 --> 00:08:43,099
There's a reason that
guys and gals like me

229
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:44,883
continue to have audiences

230
00:08:44,883 --> 00:08:48,151
because people wanna be
motivated to go and do things

231
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:51,043
or they wanna learn tactics
to go and do things.

232
00:08:51,043 --> 00:08:54,245
But whether I'm giving you tactical advice

233
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:57,460
like filters on Snapchat or Facebook Ads

234
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,996
or Instagram story collaborations

235
00:09:00,996 --> 00:09:03,985
or I'm motivating you through my words,

236
00:09:03,985 --> 00:09:05,521
because I communicate that way,

237
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:06,673
or through my actions,

238
00:09:06,673 --> 00:09:09,006
seeing this wake up at five.

239
00:09:10,302 --> 00:09:12,397
If everybody who's watching this

240
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:15,346
actually did something about it,

241
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,832
and then went on the course
of their version of it,

242
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:20,897
then they wouldn't be watching this.

243
00:09:20,897 --> 00:09:23,910
And I genuinely know at
the bottom of my heart,

244
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,541
out of all the people that
wanna build audiences,

245
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:31,017
that I'm the complete
opposite of almost all of them

246
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:34,303
because 99% of people that
produce content like this

247
00:09:34,303 --> 00:09:35,892
that are out there like I am,

248
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:38,351
the business of being
that is what they are.

249
00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:39,583
I have businesses.

250
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,448
I have Wine Library and VaynerMedia.

251
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,949
I don't need your 14 bucks for my book

252
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:46,252
or to be in my course or this and that.

253
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,596
So I don't need to monetize you.

254
00:09:47,596 --> 00:09:51,114
So I then genuinely want you

255
00:09:51,114 --> 00:09:52,913
to never watch me again.

256
00:09:52,913 --> 00:09:56,332
The problem is every time
you guys are posting,

257
00:09:56,332 --> 00:09:57,882
do you know how many times I see on my,

258
00:09:57,882 --> 00:10:00,744
on my Instagram, oh I needed this today?

259
00:10:00,744 --> 00:10:02,256
And you know how many
times I see that person

260
00:10:02,256 --> 00:10:04,585
nine months later still hanging around?

261
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:07,182
If you needed it, then take
it and do something about it.

262
00:10:07,182 --> 00:10:08,735
The reason there's gonna be

263
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:11,627
a billion motivational
views today on YouTube

264
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:15,216
is that people love the
feeling of being motivated,

265
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:16,807
they don't like putting in the work

266
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:19,640
to do something about the feeling.

267
00:10:22,643 --> 00:10:24,810
I hate the motivation me

268
00:10:27,106 --> 00:00:00,000
until you do something about it.
