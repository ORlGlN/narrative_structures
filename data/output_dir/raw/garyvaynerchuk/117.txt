1
00:00:00,677 --> 00:00:04,177
- I'm an attention arbitrage entrepreneur.

2
00:00:05,127 --> 00:00:07,710
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,957
- We are the breakfast club,

4
00:00:13,957 --> 00:00:15,381
got a special guest in the building!

5
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:17,560
- [Co-Host] My favorite
corporate thug motivator is back!

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,564
(hip hop music)

7
00:00:19,564 --> 00:00:21,933
- The next trend is meditation.

8
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:23,593
If you wanna get real smart,

9
00:00:23,593 --> 00:00:25,694
so back to hey give us a
practical piece of advice,

10
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:27,560
if you're intrigued by mental health,

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,348
I'm super intrigued by this issue.

12
00:00:29,348 --> 00:00:31,720
So I think mental health
needs to be the number one

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,406
thing we talk about over
the next twenty years.

14
00:00:34,406 --> 00:00:36,759
Mental health is something
we need to put on a pedestal,

15
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,363
and really start talking about.

16
00:00:38,363 --> 00:00:40,180
Meditation is a huge
opportunity, everybody's

17
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,490
gonna be doing it.

18
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,373
If you're operating system isn't right,

19
00:00:44,373 --> 00:00:46,356
if your brain's not right,

20
00:00:46,356 --> 00:00:48,481
nothing else is gonna work.

21
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,443
If you're a business person,

22
00:00:50,443 --> 00:00:51,513
if you're startin' a juice company,

23
00:00:51,513 --> 00:00:52,579
if you're tryin' to flip sneakers,

24
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:53,716
and it's 100% about the money,

25
00:00:53,716 --> 00:00:55,137
you're gonna lose.

26
00:00:55,137 --> 00:00:57,026
If you don't love your process,

27
00:00:57,026 --> 00:00:59,220
if you don't love eating
the shit along the way,

28
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,635
you got zero shots to hit that huge level.

29
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:04,013
If you don't like takin'
a thousand free throws,

30
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:05,861
if you don't like being in
the office until midnight,

31
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:08,672
if you don't like waiting in
line for six hours in the cold,

32
00:01:08,672 --> 00:01:10,850
to get that thing,

33
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,636
you're finished.

34
00:01:12,636 --> 00:01:14,412
The people that are winning
are the ones who wake up at

35
00:01:14,412 --> 00:01:16,355
4:30, take two trains, and
get third in line and love it.

36
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:19,839
- [Radio Host] Gary V
ladies and gentlemen!

37
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:20,672
- [Co-Host] My guy!

38
00:01:20,672 --> 00:01:23,007
- It's the breakfast club, good mornin'.

39
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:24,780
- What up vlog, I'm really
gonna miss the things,

40
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,471
tomorrow's the big day,

41
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:29,698
the launch of my sneaker
and my Jackie Robinson year,

42
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:30,531
number 42.

43
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:34,585
So lookin' forward to that.

44
00:01:34,585 --> 00:01:36,266
By the time you watch this
it was already my birthday

45
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:38,967
so in the comments you
can go with happy belated.

46
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:39,966
(dinging)

47
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,549
(upbeat music)

48
00:01:46,493 --> 00:01:49,036
- [Male] As far as
tasting shit is concerned,

49
00:01:49,036 --> 00:01:51,953
I wanna taste as much of it as I can,

50
00:01:51,953 --> 00:01:53,630
in as many places as I can.

51
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,580
- Interesting.

52
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,301
- [Male] What I'm gonna
do is travel the world.

53
00:01:56,301 --> 00:01:57,450
- I love it.

54
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,628
So what's the plan?

55
00:01:58,628 --> 00:01:59,617
In detail.

56
00:01:59,617 --> 00:02:00,985
When do you start traveling?

57
00:02:00,985 --> 00:02:01,935
- [Male] January 12th.

58
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:02,922
- And where you goin'?

59
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:03,887
- [Male] Beijing.

60
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:04,858
- And what are you doing there?

61
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,027
- [Male] Teaching three to
five year old kids English.

62
00:02:06,027 --> 00:02:07,428
- I love it.

63
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:08,523
- [Male] I love your
thoughts on this idea.

64
00:02:08,523 --> 00:02:10,288
With personal branding in mind,

65
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:12,492
I realized that I don't
necessarily wanna be the

66
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:13,866
person marketing someone else.

67
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:15,016
- You wanna market yourself?

68
00:02:15,016 --> 00:02:16,729
- [Male] I wanna market myself.

69
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:17,868
- I understand that.

70
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:19,220
- [Male] Yeah.

71
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,623
I obviously need to have
time where I can say

72
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:22,402
something worth a value
that actually helps people.

73
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:23,667
- Or you document versus creating, right?

74
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:25,232
I think it's super
appropriate for you to talk

75
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:28,232
about the one year in China and like

76
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:33,073
get a homie to help you
or you do it yourself

77
00:02:33,073 --> 00:02:35,619
like Casey does of like
all those journeys and

78
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:37,910
learning things and struggling
with learning Mandarin

79
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,121
and I didn't know how
hard languages were or

80
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:42,901
you know, my God, this kid in my class

81
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,586
understood English in one
day, he's a fuckin' genius or

82
00:02:44,586 --> 00:02:46,946
I tasted this fruit and what the fuck.

83
00:02:46,946 --> 00:02:50,873
The big thing I push against
and this is good clarity

84
00:02:50,873 --> 00:02:52,809
for everybody watching and you,

85
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:56,035
is just when people front
and they think they're

86
00:02:56,035 --> 00:02:58,188
business expert or a life coach at 22,

87
00:02:58,188 --> 00:02:59,726
it's tough.

88
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:02,255
It's tough because other
people look at that and say,

89
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:04,463
- [Male] They can smell the bullshit.

90
00:03:04,463 --> 00:03:06,013
- Yeah, you know what, listen.

91
00:03:06,013 --> 00:03:07,505
Talent is talent, maybe you're so wise,

92
00:03:07,505 --> 00:03:09,215
I feel like I was an old soul,

93
00:03:09,215 --> 00:03:11,010
so maybe you can be a life coach at 22,

94
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,667
it's not for me to judge.

95
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:15,197
I think that people do it
for the sake of selling

96
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:17,193
some program for $1,000 a month.

97
00:03:17,193 --> 00:03:19,623
- [Male] Which isn't my end goal at all.

98
00:03:19,623 --> 00:03:21,572
- And by the way, that
doesn't bother me either,

99
00:03:21,572 --> 00:03:24,590
it's just that I see a
lot of people building

100
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,233
a personal brand with one agenda,

101
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:28,054
to then monetize that audience

102
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:29,772
in some sort of horse shit thing.

103
00:03:29,772 --> 00:03:33,324
So to me, I don't think you
have to eat shit for a decade.

104
00:03:33,324 --> 00:03:36,091
You don't have to do my narrative.

105
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,829
I'm not sure if I would
have stayed quiet from

106
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:41,237
22 to 34 if all this existed.

107
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:44,317
But what I do know is I
wouldn't be acting the way

108
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:47,173
I'm acting now, I'd be talking about,

109
00:03:47,173 --> 00:03:49,734
first of all I wish it
happened because then

110
00:03:49,734 --> 00:03:51,763
everybody would have
really saw how fuckin' hard

111
00:03:51,763 --> 00:03:53,425
I was working.

112
00:03:53,425 --> 00:03:55,563
But I think it's super
appropriate to document man.

113
00:03:55,563 --> 00:03:58,096
I think the documentation
creates the origin story.

114
00:03:58,096 --> 00:04:02,263
When you can recall shit
at 29 or 34 and literally

115
00:04:03,685 --> 00:04:07,852
play the clip of the first
time that you use AR in Asia,

116
00:04:09,381 --> 00:04:10,214
got it?

117
00:04:11,686 --> 00:04:13,506
That's why it's important.

118
00:04:13,506 --> 00:04:15,416
What people don't realize
about what I'm doing right now,

119
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,741
is this is fuckin' awesome.

120
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:20,699
Ten years from now this
make this look like shit.

121
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,455
When I'm recalling shit.

122
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:25,844
- [Male] And recalling the recall.

123
00:04:25,844 --> 00:04:28,116
- Do you know how crazy
it's gonna be when fuckin'

124
00:04:28,116 --> 00:04:30,146
voice rules the world and I
show this entire fuckin' year

125
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:31,602
of me spitting it?

126
00:04:31,602 --> 00:04:33,504
It's one thing for me,

127
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:35,146
it happened the other day.

128
00:04:35,146 --> 00:04:37,074
Those musically tweets, late at night,

129
00:04:37,074 --> 00:04:39,535
of me talkin' about
musically two years ago,

130
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:41,911
and putting musically
on and believing in it,

131
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:43,606
and then it sells for a billion dollars,

132
00:04:43,606 --> 00:04:45,256
a hell of a lot better than
when I tell people I like

133
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:47,181
invested in Facebook and Twitter,

134
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:48,922
'cause that's me telling you.

135
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:51,527
Me showing you, plus
it's also cool for life.

136
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:54,014
You're grandkids, are you kidding?

137
00:04:54,014 --> 00:04:54,847
In China?

138
00:04:55,953 --> 00:04:57,907
That's fuckin' rad.

139
00:04:57,907 --> 00:04:59,388
You know?

140
00:04:59,388 --> 00:05:03,087
So I would create as
much content as possible.

141
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:04,538
That would be my advice.

142
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:05,929
It's a real pleasure
man, good luck to you.

143
00:05:05,929 --> 00:05:07,010
Thanks for everything.

144
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,242
- Thank you.

145
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:09,370
- [Gary] Thank you.

146
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,817
(upbeat music)

147
00:05:11,817 --> 00:05:13,387
- Anything I can help you
with in the few minutes

148
00:05:13,387 --> 00:05:14,458
that we have here?

149
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,949
- [Male] Yeah, so I think
my biggest concern right now

150
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,946
is getting a team.

151
00:05:18,946 --> 00:05:22,499
So it's hard to hire people
who are actually skillful

152
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:25,337
at the right price, 'cause like.

153
00:05:25,337 --> 00:05:26,621
- Can you teach it quickly?

154
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:28,433
- [Male] Yes and no.

155
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:29,582
I feel like I can teach it.

156
00:05:29,582 --> 00:05:31,187
- Let me ask a better question.

157
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:32,484
Can you fire quickly?

158
00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:33,696
Are you allowed in China to fire?

159
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:34,964
- [Male] Yes.

160
00:05:34,964 --> 00:05:36,043
- Then that's what, then you're lucky.

161
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:37,135
If you were in fuckin' Norway, or Europe,

162
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:39,957
France, you're dead with my thesis.

163
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:42,284
I've got a great answer for you.

164
00:05:42,284 --> 00:05:43,953
Fire quickly.

165
00:05:43,953 --> 00:05:45,050
I'm giving you my advice.

166
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,488
Eating my own dog food.

167
00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:49,514
I go on gut, Kyle, I keep pointing at him

168
00:05:49,514 --> 00:05:51,470
'cause he's filming it, I'm goin' on gut.

169
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,139
I had a phone call with
him, I had a drink at a bar

170
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:55,036
with him and I'm like, "You're hired."

171
00:05:55,036 --> 00:05:57,190
If he sucked or was all
time it would have both

172
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,154
made sense to me.

173
00:05:59,154 --> 00:06:00,838
If I fire quickly, he'll
work for me for nine weeks

174
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:03,823
but I'll give him a
three months severance so

175
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:05,380
I feel like I'm a good guy.

176
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,680
You know?

177
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,941
So I didn't fuck him up too much,

178
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:09,345
or I'll know their situation,

179
00:06:09,345 --> 00:06:10,926
like if I hire somebody who like,

180
00:06:10,926 --> 00:06:12,613
had no options in life, I'm like, look.

181
00:06:12,613 --> 00:06:14,441
It's not like I took 'em away from

182
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,325
Harvard Business School.

183
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:18,080
You know, I'll play the
reality of the situation.

184
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,720
I think that's what you do man,

185
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,426
you fire quickly.

186
00:06:21,426 --> 00:06:22,961
- Here in Bangor video with--

187
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:24,628
- What up everybody?

188
00:06:25,882 --> 00:06:27,757
Hope you guys are doin' your thing.

189
00:06:27,757 --> 00:06:29,751
One life baby, take advantage of it.

190
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:30,709
- Thank you.

191
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:33,292
(upbeat music)

192
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:35,775
- [Gary] Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

193
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,957
- [Host] What's up bro?

194
00:06:36,957 --> 00:06:38,069
- [Gary] What up baby?

195
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:40,408
- This is the ambassador of arbitrage,

196
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:42,658
the hiram leader of hustle,

197
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:46,593
Gary Vaynerchuk is in the building.

198
00:06:46,593 --> 00:06:47,698
What's up man?

199
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,939
- Life is good man, thanks for havin' me.

200
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:52,944
My legacy of like putting
people on and bringing value

201
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:54,575
while I got mine,

202
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:57,345
is gonna matter exponentially
more to me than the

203
00:06:57,345 --> 00:06:58,629
dollar amounts.

204
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:00,294
You listen,

205
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,012
there's a lot of people who
are gonna make more money

206
00:07:02,012 --> 00:07:02,845
than me.

207
00:07:04,046 --> 00:07:05,728
But I really, really, am
gonna try to make sure

208
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:06,933
nobody has a bigger impact than me.

209
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:08,200
- [Host] That's some fly shit.

210
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,060
- It's why I'm passionate
about doing stuff like this.

211
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:14,227
I, after doing a quick
audit and kind of intuition

212
00:07:15,095 --> 00:07:16,799
of like I knew I wanted to do it,

213
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:19,435
do you know how pumped I
am I'm doin' this show?

214
00:07:19,435 --> 00:07:20,700
Do you know why?

215
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,656
'Cause I want you to use
me as a guest of this

216
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:25,388
to get a different level of guests

217
00:07:25,388 --> 00:07:27,211
to get you to the next place.

218
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:29,588
I know where I came from,

219
00:07:29,588 --> 00:07:32,092
and giving back to that thing

220
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:34,710
is the most interesting
thing in the world.

221
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,076
And the amount of, in a world
where my hour is my fuckin'

222
00:07:38,076 --> 00:07:40,596
- [Host] Yeah, that's
a lot of time for you.

223
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:43,340
- You know, to me, if you
ask me the thing that's

224
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,085
most interesting for me,

225
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:47,118
it's the emails you're gonna
send to the other people

226
00:07:47,118 --> 00:07:48,471
or people when they look, you know?

227
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:49,804
Brand arbitrage.

228
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:52,927
I think my bigger advantage was my mother.

229
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:56,660
If you ask me what's a
bigger advantage to why

230
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,827
I'm gonna win?

231
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:01,379
It is way more my mother
than being a white dude.

232
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:03,735
'Cause she fuckin' set me up.

233
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:05,213
Real proper.

234
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:07,130
So I think your mother,

235
00:08:07,993 --> 00:08:10,379
and I'm talkin' about
everybody who's watching,

236
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:12,499
or your father if he was the stay at home.

237
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:14,082
Whoever raised you.

238
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:16,741
Let's go cliche, or
your grandmother, right?

239
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:18,809
Let me go to every angle.

240
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:20,913
- [Host] Let's go some more.

241
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:22,163
- Right, right?

242
00:08:22,997 --> 00:08:24,993
That is bigger,

243
00:08:24,993 --> 00:08:27,438
is a crazy variable in the
way that I see the world.

244
00:08:27,438 --> 00:08:29,780
The person that was the
puppet master of your mindset

245
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,187
positive or negative.

246
00:08:32,187 --> 00:08:35,799
My grandmother fucked my dad up real good.

247
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,683
And my dad won,

248
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,900
but she was negative.

249
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,852
Everything was bad.

250
00:08:41,852 --> 00:08:43,765
Don't believe in anybody.

251
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:45,288
Everybody's jealous.

252
00:08:45,288 --> 00:08:46,814
Everything is bad.

253
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:48,341
The world's out to get you.

254
00:08:48,341 --> 00:08:50,683
And watching my dad filter the world,

255
00:08:50,683 --> 00:08:53,089
I'm like fuck man, I'm glad I
don't see the world that way

256
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:55,554
and that has nothing to do
with black, white, girl, boy,

257
00:08:55,554 --> 00:08:57,482
so, that's how I see it.

258
00:08:57,482 --> 00:08:59,277
Everybody's reality is their reality.

259
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:01,018
Like they don't know.

260
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:04,913
Like it's tough, nobody
can be in anybody's shoes.

261
00:09:04,913 --> 00:09:09,346
Nobody was with me when I
was crying to my mom like,

262
00:09:09,346 --> 00:09:12,014
at 18 I would cry to my mom a lot.

263
00:09:12,014 --> 00:09:14,302
The last time I really cried a lot except

264
00:09:14,302 --> 00:09:16,988
when Garrison Hurst
broke a 99 yard touchdown

265
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:19,262
in 1999 against the Jets in week one

266
00:09:19,262 --> 00:09:21,946
in overtime, I literally cried.

267
00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:23,835
I was 24 years old, just
so everybody understands.

268
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:26,681
Anyway, I didn't want to go to

269
00:09:26,681 --> 00:09:28,457
my dad's liquor store business.

270
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:31,915
The great struggle of my early adult life

271
00:09:31,915 --> 00:09:35,083
was knowing that I knew I
was gonna be all time great.

272
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,685
Knew it.

273
00:09:36,685 --> 00:09:40,993
And I knew that if I went
and got into my dad's

274
00:09:40,993 --> 00:09:43,492
liquor store business that
people would dangle it over

275
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:45,043
my head.

276
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,394
But I knew that I wanted
to right by my dad

277
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:49,951
and mom 'cause they did so right by me.

278
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:52,409
To ever apologize when you
don't do the wrong thing

279
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:54,268
is a wrong strategy.

280
00:09:54,268 --> 00:09:55,843
- [Host] You're right
it is, I never say sorry

281
00:09:55,843 --> 00:09:57,251
for something I don't do.

282
00:09:57,251 --> 00:09:59,648
- And by the way, on the
flip side on love those

283
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:01,323
rare occasions where I get to say sorry

284
00:10:01,323 --> 00:10:02,685
'cause I'll say it.

285
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,988
You gotta own your shit.

286
00:10:03,988 --> 00:10:05,817
No body fuckin' listening
or watchin' this is perfect.

287
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:10,619
Baseball cards, wine, the
agency and even me as a human.

288
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:12,562
I'm doin' the same shit over and over.

289
00:10:12,562 --> 00:10:15,116
I disproportionately understand
what people are gonna

290
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:16,470
do before they do it.

291
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,656
I'm willing to eat shit and do the work,

292
00:10:18,656 --> 00:10:20,459
not just pontificate about it.

293
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,722
And then I deploy that
attention of those executions

294
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,847
against the the thing.

295
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:27,665
And then I got smart seven
years ago and said fuck,

296
00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:31,031
let me build a machine around this skill.

297
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:34,334
Vander Media is the
manifestation of the the platform

298
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,994
that is basically my one thing.

299
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:40,490
And my one thing is intuitive
understanding of what

300
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,196
people are gonna do before
they do and go it all in.

301
00:10:42,196 --> 00:10:46,867
Investing in a Twitter and
Tumblr and all this stuff

302
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:49,035
right, that's what I did.

303
00:10:49,035 --> 00:10:51,428
- [Host] If you were to die
tomorrow, what would you

304
00:10:51,428 --> 00:10:53,128
wanna be remembered for?

305
00:10:53,128 --> 00:10:55,214
- That I gave more than I took.

306
00:10:55,214 --> 00:10:57,359
- I have a thing that I'm doing.

307
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:58,950
That I started when it comes to education

308
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,964
called Black Boys Win.

309
00:10:59,964 --> 00:11:00,797
Almost like a Udemi for young black boys,

310
00:11:00,797 --> 00:11:04,564
manhood training, things of that nature.

311
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:07,580
What do you think I need
to do to raise the funds?

312
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,113
- How much do you need?

313
00:11:09,113 --> 00:11:10,565
- Right now I need 15 grand.

314
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:11,398
- I'm in.

315
00:11:12,865 --> 00:11:13,835
- I'm sorry, what?

316
00:11:13,835 --> 00:11:15,747
- I'll pay for the whole thing.

317
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:17,573
- Get the fuck outta here.

318
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:19,899
Is this tape rollin'?

319
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:21,611
Son of a bitch.

320
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:23,696
- Now do somethin' with it.

321
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:25,151
- Man trust me.

322
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:25,984
I will.

323
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:27,597
That's amazing, like thank you.

324
00:11:27,597 --> 00:11:29,229
- You're welcome.

325
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:30,246
- [Host] Very famous shook.

326
00:11:30,246 --> 00:11:31,079
Thank you bro.

327
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:31,912
- You're welcome bro.

328
00:11:31,912 --> 00:11:32,745
- [Host] I appreciate that man.

329
00:11:32,745 --> 00:11:33,578
- See ya.

330
00:11:33,578 --> 00:11:36,161
(upbeat music)

331
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,373
- [Nicole] Hello?

332
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:39,326
- What's the name again?

333
00:11:39,326 --> 00:11:40,989
Nicole, hey, it's Gary Vaynerchuk,

334
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:42,460
and you're on the Ask Gary
V show with Tim Ferris.

335
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,182
- [Nicole] Oh my God, I'm losing my mind.

336
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:49,349
- If you're tried and true,
the market will come to you.

337
00:11:50,445 --> 00:11:53,303
What is super interesting
to me about hip hop is

338
00:11:53,303 --> 00:11:57,470
it is now an absolute fundamental
pillar of our culture,

339
00:11:59,181 --> 00:12:03,079
across all genres and it
stayed true to itself,

340
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:04,780
it evolved.

341
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,638
But the world came to hip hop,

342
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:08,463
hip hop didn't go to the world.

343
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:10,061
And I realized as I got
older, oh rock and roll

344
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:11,639
did the same thing.

345
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,945
And honestly, that's
what happened with me and

346
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:15,128
entrepreneurship.

347
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:17,416
If you believe in your
thing, stick with it,

348
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,194
and the world will come to you.

349
00:12:19,194 --> 00:12:21,762
If you're passionate
about cricket protein,

350
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:22,980
this is not a joke by the way now,

351
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,849
this is actually something
that I think is gonna

352
00:12:24,849 --> 00:12:25,726
work out,

353
00:12:25,726 --> 00:12:27,012
if you're passionate
about cricket protein,

354
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,440
bet the farm on it,

355
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,218
because if you see it and you
understand why you see it,

356
00:12:30,218 --> 00:12:32,878
it's gonna be a lot of
fun in nine years when

357
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,124
we're all eating it.

358
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:36,894
And you were there, not
because it's not selling

359
00:12:36,894 --> 00:12:39,084
right now, most of things
that have brought good

360
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:40,722
to Tim and I,

361
00:12:40,722 --> 00:12:42,200
'cause I can definitely
speak for myself but I've

362
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,674
watched from afar and
sometimes close with Tim,

363
00:12:44,674 --> 00:12:47,527
people weren't super
sure about at the time,

364
00:12:47,527 --> 00:12:49,741
we're playing on being
historically correct,

365
00:12:49,741 --> 00:12:52,723
hip hop was historically correct.

366
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:57,701
On this episode, the incredible
Timothy Ferris stops by.

367
00:12:57,701 --> 00:13:01,034
(upbeat music)

368
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:02,482
- [Male] Gary?

369
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,478
- Yes?

370
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:05,020
- [Male] Can we go over
an article really quick?

371
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,544
Not an interview, but.

372
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:08,325
- Yes, give me one second.

373
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:10,091
Here it is, givin' away these shoes,

374
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:11,365
who's getting these?

375
00:13:11,365 --> 00:13:12,320
Some great kid.

376
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,286
First pair I ever wore, being shipped out

377
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:15,205
this is one of the great
reasons to be part of

378
00:13:15,205 --> 00:13:18,122
my notification squad on Instagram,

379
00:13:19,235 --> 00:13:21,005
make sure you set you notifications,

380
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:22,278
60 second club.

381
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:23,678
We're just having fun with it,

382
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,937
it's a lot of fun.

383
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,309
Gamification, just like fun.

384
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:27,944
Literally fun needs to be part of it.

385
00:13:27,944 --> 00:13:30,844
I think it's funny that you
have to comment in the first

386
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:33,505
60 seconds, I don't think
there's any big strategy,

387
00:13:33,505 --> 00:13:36,387
you know, I don't think
it brings any value,

388
00:13:36,387 --> 00:13:38,546
I think the value is fun and

389
00:13:38,546 --> 00:13:40,767
escaping something fun is a big thing, so

390
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:43,439
turn on your notifications
on Instagram I'm always

391
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:44,817
doin' a ton of stuff.

392
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:46,669
First pair, is this going in this box?

393
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:47,836
Switching out?

394
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,544
First pair I ever wore,

395
00:13:50,544 --> 00:13:51,740
getting sent out.

396
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,620
Do you know his name?

397
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,565
- [Male] Muhammad Hosan.

398
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:55,133
- Muhammad Hosan, enjoy
it brother, love you.

399
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:56,435
- [Male] For his younger brother actually.

400
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,969
- Oh is that right?

401
00:13:57,969 --> 00:13:59,186
Even better.

402
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:01,707
Listen get a good look at
this, maybe there's some

403
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,254
sort of scuff that people
can prove this was,

404
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:04,799
actually,

405
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,409
go get me a pen or some sorts.

406
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:07,242
Yeah.

407
00:14:08,076 --> 00:14:08,993
Here it is.

408
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,813
O O 1.

409
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:14,303
First pair.

410
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:17,334
There it is.

411
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:20,189
Let me put it on this one too.

412
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:22,390
Hassan or his bother,

413
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:25,665
you might be able to make
some money on this one day

414
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:28,438
if I can continue to
bring value to the world.

415
00:14:28,438 --> 00:14:32,012
- I have complete understanding
that what I'm saying

416
00:14:32,012 --> 00:14:34,154
doesn't always encompass
everyone's specific

417
00:14:34,154 --> 00:14:36,846
circumstances and want to
acknowledge that I'm doing

418
00:14:36,846 --> 00:14:38,227
the best that I can.

419
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:40,185
At it's most basic form,
I wanna use some of these

420
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:41,952
ideas and expressions to
further conversation or

421
00:14:41,952 --> 00:14:45,604
allow someone to experience
the personal unlock

422
00:14:45,604 --> 00:14:49,161
to see things different or
with a different perspective.

423
00:14:49,161 --> 00:14:52,140
I just want you to look at the bright side

424
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,547
and to the best of my ability
inspire others to have

425
00:14:54,547 --> 00:14:57,630
access to another mindset
that I found valuable in

426
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,630
my own life.

427
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,474
As a practitioner of these ideas,

428
00:15:01,474 --> 00:15:03,731
I'm trying to give you
advice that's worked for me.

429
00:15:03,731 --> 00:15:07,393
The reason I differentiate
my content is so that

430
00:15:07,393 --> 00:15:09,787
I can have a great
articulation on a number of

431
00:15:09,787 --> 00:15:10,829
specific issues.

432
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:13,055
With video you get to
hear what I'm saying.

433
00:15:13,055 --> 00:15:15,918
Which is always improvised
and only captures my

434
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:17,912
thoughts in a single moment.

435
00:15:17,912 --> 00:15:19,837
One of the things I find most fascinating

436
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:22,214
is that even though I document everything,

437
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:25,364
you still only get to
see one to 2% of what's

438
00:15:25,364 --> 00:15:26,422
really going on.

439
00:15:26,422 --> 00:15:28,940
You are hearing one
sentence in one meeting

440
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,577
during one day.

441
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:33,350
The funny thing is the vlog
I produce is only 15 minutes

442
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,140
of the 15 hours of work.

443
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,382
All in all, you actually
don't get to see that much.

444
00:15:37,382 --> 00:15:41,360
So the reason why I do a
podcast and a vlog and full-time

445
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,164
Instagram and produce these
articles is so I can give you

446
00:15:44,164 --> 00:15:47,016
the most nuance to my ideas
and to respect the creator

447
00:15:47,016 --> 00:15:49,487
and the differences of each platform.

448
00:15:49,487 --> 00:15:52,403
Quotes on Instagram might not
always capture the full story,

449
00:15:52,403 --> 00:15:55,691
which is why I write these
articles to expand those ideas

450
00:15:55,691 --> 00:15:57,709
and go deeper into the details.

451
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:00,808
You have to analyze context
and look at the bigger picture.

452
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:03,996
I'm always trying to assess
what works in culture

453
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:07,243
and deploy my creative in a
way that make sense for the

454
00:16:07,243 --> 00:16:09,011
context of the Rumin Pumpkin.

455
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:11,816
Currently full time
Instagram would be work.

456
00:16:11,816 --> 00:16:14,353
They're one piece of the
puzzle that have enormous

457
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:17,025
impact for what I would consider the most

458
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:18,914
motivational side of me.

459
00:16:18,914 --> 00:16:21,440
The vlog, podcasts and
articles are where I can get

460
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,430
tactic way about what
I'm trying to convey.

461
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,263
I can't write 10 pages on
legacy and put it on Twitter.

462
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:30,774
I can't always articulate
all of my thoughts and

463
00:16:30,774 --> 00:16:32,891
keynote ranger media.

464
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,263
Those nuances and that
context is really, really,

465
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:36,851
important.

466
00:16:36,851 --> 00:16:40,000
A lot of people wanna judge
me and make assessments

467
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,407
with a single piece of content they see,

468
00:16:42,407 --> 00:16:44,348
but the truth is it's all about context.

469
00:16:44,348 --> 00:16:47,123
You have to watch my
videos and read my articles

470
00:16:47,123 --> 00:16:49,121
and listen to my keynotes
to really understand

471
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:51,361
my tweets, my quotes or
two minute videos online,

472
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:54,793
that's where the message
is, that's where the mindset

473
00:16:54,793 --> 00:16:56,126
comes in pretty.

474
00:16:57,026 --> 00:16:59,546
- Put in quotes there, in
parentheses or something there

475
00:16:59,546 --> 00:17:02,847
and also say, "Or you
don't because I know you

476
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:05,925
guys have options and time,
but to get the full picture

477
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:06,758
that's the reality of the situation.

478
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:08,175
It's like a great

479
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,153
meal at a restaurant.

480
00:17:12,652 --> 00:17:16,191
You're more than welcome to
just judge it on the green peas.

481
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:19,186
Without taking into consideration
the glass of Champagne

482
00:17:19,186 --> 00:17:21,389
that we gave you when you first walked in,

483
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,541
the music that was playing,

484
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,221
the smiles from the bartender,

485
00:17:26,222 --> 00:17:28,273
the color of the linens,

486
00:17:28,273 --> 00:17:32,441
the peas, before mentioned
peas, as your first dish,

487
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:37,387
the main course, the
dessert, the wine selection,

488
00:17:37,387 --> 00:17:38,977
the service,

489
00:17:38,977 --> 00:17:41,977
and the treats we sent you home with

490
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:46,767
and the follow up phone call
we gave you two weeks later

491
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:48,378
to see how it was, you
didn't see the whole thing."

492
00:17:48,378 --> 00:17:52,545
That's how I think about
my entire content strategy.

493
00:17:57,196 --> 00:17:58,395
It's cool right?

494
00:17:58,395 --> 00:17:59,228
It's true.

495
00:18:00,487 --> 00:18:02,379
Fuck, you know what's even more true?

496
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:04,189
You guys both consumed
my content a lot of it,

497
00:18:04,189 --> 00:18:08,614
and you had no fucking idea
until you got the vortex.

498
00:18:08,614 --> 00:18:12,990
Even remotely close to how
deep and real it is, right?

499
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,898
- [Male] Yeah I always
tell people the difference

500
00:18:14,898 --> 00:18:16,660
from consuming it to
working directly with you

501
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,001
and filming it.

502
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:20,328
- Yeah the filming is the crazy what?

503
00:18:20,328 --> 00:18:22,705
What's the most intense?

504
00:18:22,705 --> 00:18:23,761
Here give me this.

505
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:26,738
This is gonna be the meat of the episode.

506
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,375
So, filming it, what?

507
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:32,292
- Basically just I get
to observe every moment,

508
00:18:33,957 --> 00:18:37,936
every minute, every meeting,
everything you mumble,

509
00:18:37,936 --> 00:18:38,853
everything.

510
00:18:39,982 --> 00:18:41,680
- [Gary] So what's the early
observations of what that,

511
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,847
what does that give you
clarity into or what's the

512
00:18:46,913 --> 00:18:49,827
observation, and don't
sugar coat it to be nice.

513
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:53,242
- Well basically I went
from consuming it as a fan,

514
00:18:53,242 --> 00:18:55,325
and online mentor to then

515
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,946
working directly with Gary, with you

516
00:18:58,946 --> 00:19:02,196
to then filming it being on the inside,

517
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:08,358
seeing the way your mind
runs, your whole thought

518
00:19:08,358 --> 00:19:11,873
process behind everything in the meetings,

519
00:19:11,873 --> 00:19:14,034
all the conversations you have.

520
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:15,283
- [Gary] So what have you learned?

521
00:19:15,283 --> 00:19:19,127
- Well one of my favorite
things to do while filming

522
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:23,134
you is just observing what you observe.

523
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:27,272
So for instance, today
you had the first podcast

524
00:19:27,272 --> 00:19:28,561
that you did.

525
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:30,262
- Gary Vaynerchuk is in the building.

526
00:19:30,262 --> 00:19:31,459
What's up man?

527
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:34,253
- And you mentioned
something about the shoes.

528
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:35,494
- [Gary] Yes.

529
00:19:35,494 --> 00:19:36,894
- And you were gonna
give him a pair of shoes.

530
00:19:36,894 --> 00:19:38,960
And then you, once he said.

531
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,402
- [Gary] 13's?

532
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:42,178
- Yeah he said 13's.

533
00:19:42,178 --> 00:19:44,158
- [Host] I don't have any
sneakers but I wear size 13.

534
00:19:44,158 --> 00:19:46,047
- Respect, get it done guys.

535
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,741
- And then he said surprise
me, whichever ones.

536
00:19:47,741 --> 00:19:49,132
- You want the leather or the flyden?

537
00:19:49,132 --> 00:19:51,455
- [Host] I'll let you pick, I don't care.

538
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:52,693
- You looked at his shoes.

539
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:54,514
- [Host] Second thing.

540
00:19:54,514 --> 00:19:56,075
- [Gary] Oh.

541
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:59,223
Good job, I'm proud, dude
you just made the vlog good.

542
00:19:59,223 --> 00:20:01,834
- You looked at his shoes
real quick and I know

543
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,866
just in my mind, told me
like you just wanna check

544
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:05,427
out his style.

545
00:20:05,427 --> 00:20:07,438
- [Gary] So you know what that his?

546
00:20:07,438 --> 00:20:09,915
You know how I always talk
shit that I'm listening

547
00:20:09,915 --> 00:20:12,319
more than it looks like,
that's a perfect example.

548
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,506
- Those are the things I always look for.

549
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,671
- [Gary] You just made the vlog good.

550
00:20:17,671 --> 00:20:18,504
Cool.

551
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,653
Let's go.

552
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,834
What's it titled?

553
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:26,983
- [Male] My content is a mindset.

554
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:28,622
- Great, let's go.

555
00:20:28,622 --> 00:20:29,907
Publish it.

556
00:20:29,907 --> 00:20:33,395
(dramatic music)

557
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:35,379
- Do you know if I had a
wish besides good health for

558
00:20:35,379 --> 00:20:40,086
all of you, is that I wish
people understood what they

559
00:20:40,086 --> 00:20:41,900
felt like when they were older?

560
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,621
That would be such a gift,
'cause it would slow down

561
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:45,536
the whole game, you'd be
so much more thoughtful

562
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,369
because that's what
you're running up against

563
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:48,786
when you're, when it's early.

564
00:20:50,098 --> 00:20:53,187
You know, dollars, or
things that you, you know,

565
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:56,602
what ever checkbox your
family and your DNA created

566
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:59,232
in your mind and we're racing against that

567
00:20:59,232 --> 00:21:01,643
and it's such a short term arbitrage,

568
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:03,643
and it creates such bad behavior.

569
00:21:03,643 --> 00:21:06,792
If you guys knew what it
felt like to be 15 years

570
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,302
older than you are right now,

571
00:21:08,302 --> 00:21:10,191
you would get real patient and that would

572
00:21:10,191 --> 00:21:12,599
give you huge advantages.

573
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:15,932
Wrapping up, heading home, family stuff.

574
00:21:17,265 --> 00:00:00,000
(dramatic music)
