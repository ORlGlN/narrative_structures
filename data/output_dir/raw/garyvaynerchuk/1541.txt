1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,859
so some<font color="#CCCCCC"> crusher books just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did an IMU</font>

2
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:07,919
seminar and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been on this book tour</font>

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,750
talking a lot about what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> calling the</font>

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,389
Thank You<font color="#E5E5E5"> economy I want probably more</font>

5
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:16,560
money from the bets i made<font color="#E5E5E5"> that crusher</font>

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,119
would make the New York Times bestseller

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,740
list the top 10 the print version then I

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,240
probably did signing the book deal

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,039
because so many people told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that</font>

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,500
people would not die you know from

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,750
internet brands that I put out so much

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,010
content for free that there's no reason

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,870
to buy something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a book and that</font>

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,430
you know old media people thought that

15
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,170
definitely and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of new media people</font>

16
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,059
who bet me thought I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there</font>

17
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">because other internet celebrities or</font>

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,829
salinity experts have not done well with

19
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,280
their books either and so what I knew

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,800
and what I'm powerfully excited about is

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,449
what i call the Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You economy I</font>

22
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:56,129
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're headed towards the Thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> You</font>

23
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:58,949
economy see content though King and

24
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,780
though probably more important than ever

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,250
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think every business needs to</font>

26
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,489
be in it the cost and value<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it has</font>

27
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,040
completely plunged because it's classic

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,770
economics of supply and demand there's

29
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,170
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more supply now that the demand</font>

30
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,210
to pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is considerably lower</font>

31
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,060
however it is the foundation of giving

32
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">you the ability to bring people into</font>

33
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,119
