1
00:00:00,143 --> 00:00:01,455
- What up vlog.

2
00:00:01,455 --> 00:00:03,969
This is keynote I gave in
Oslo a couple weeks ago.

3
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:05,897
Super excited about it.

4
00:00:05,897 --> 00:00:07,608
Really felt strong.

5
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:10,744
Thought a lot of insights
that I haven't touched on

6
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,878
in the past were extracted.

7
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:15,795
The tremendous Oslo, Oslo stand up!

8
00:00:16,638 --> 00:00:19,171
Incredible crowd in Oslo,

9
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:22,575
extracted some interesting
insights and I hope you enjoy it.

10
00:00:22,575 --> 00:00:25,002
Real state of the union
where my mind is at

11
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:26,661
when it comes to attention and framework

12
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:29,578
and strategy around how to succeed.

13
00:00:29,578 --> 00:00:31,012
Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.

14
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:33,595
(upbeat music)

15
00:00:37,852 --> 00:00:41,352
Oslo get ready for the single best keynote

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,782
in the history or this wonderful country

17
00:00:44,782 --> 00:00:46,532
is about to be given.

18
00:00:48,777 --> 00:00:51,777
(audience applause)

19
00:00:57,802 --> 00:01:00,385
(upbeat music)

20
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:12,526
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you Oslo.

21
00:01:12,526 --> 00:01:14,264
- [Man In Crowd] I love you!

22
00:01:14,264 --> 00:01:15,894
- I love you back, bro.

23
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:17,023
(audience laughter)

24
00:01:17,023 --> 00:01:18,869
It's always good when you
bring your brother to a talk.

25
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,909
(audience laughter)

26
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:24,396
So, you know, I love this format,

27
00:01:24,396 --> 00:01:25,722
I really appreciate this format.

28
00:01:25,722 --> 00:01:28,635
The give a talk, then we'll
do some Q and A together,

29
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:30,562
then we'll bring you guys in.

30
00:01:30,562 --> 00:01:32,854
And so, what I want to
accomplish in part one here

31
00:01:32,854 --> 00:01:35,259
is to create a framework
of some of the things

32
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:38,197
that may inspire some questions in detail

33
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:39,815
when we get to that part.

34
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:42,543
I think what excites me more than anything

35
00:01:42,543 --> 00:01:44,343
as I sit here this morning

36
00:01:44,343 --> 00:01:47,341
is that we are living through
such an interesting time.

37
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,724
One that I think is quite binary.

38
00:01:49,724 --> 00:01:52,288
I'm curious what's going
through people's minds.

39
00:01:52,288 --> 00:01:53,823
As a matter of fact, real quick,

40
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:55,741
because I asked some questions,
did a little homework.

41
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,642
How many people here are
in the B to B business,

42
00:01:58,642 --> 00:02:00,365
raise your hands.

43
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:03,071
So this is exciting for me,
because that's quite a bit,

44
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:05,106
and it was interesting
what I was thinking about

45
00:02:05,106 --> 00:02:06,593
on my flight last night.

46
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:09,937
I think that there's a
lot of misconceptions,

47
00:02:09,937 --> 00:02:13,968
assumptions, curiosities, difficulties,

48
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:17,016
for a lot of B to B marketers,
for a lot of entrepreneurs,

49
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:19,113
for a lot of consumer based companies.

50
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:21,472
I think it's a very binary debate.

51
00:02:21,472 --> 00:02:23,048
I really think that we're
in a place right now

52
00:02:23,048 --> 00:02:26,475
where you either believe in
what I think is happening

53
00:02:26,475 --> 00:02:27,595
or you don't.

54
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:29,856
And I think, I want everybody
to listen to that sentence

55
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:32,886
very carefully, not about what's coming,

56
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,188
not what's about to happen.

57
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:39,382
What's happening, versus
believing that or not.

58
00:02:39,382 --> 00:02:40,822
And so what I mean by that is

59
00:02:40,822 --> 00:02:43,053
I believe a lot of the
things that are happening

60
00:02:43,053 --> 00:02:46,219
on the mobile device,
and most importantly,

61
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:50,749
the attention of the end
consumer is not debatable.

62
00:02:50,749 --> 00:02:52,854
And I think that a lot
of people continue to

63
00:02:52,854 --> 00:02:55,080
conjure up statements like,

64
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,317
yes Gary, in a couple of years.

65
00:02:57,317 --> 00:03:00,816
Or soon, or it's coming,
or we can feel it.

66
00:03:00,816 --> 00:03:04,162
All these things that
allude to its non-reality,

67
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:08,317
and to be very frank, I'm not
frustrated or disappointed.

68
00:03:08,317 --> 00:03:12,173
To be very frank, I don't
give a shit what you do.

69
00:03:12,173 --> 00:03:13,334
I really don't.

70
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:15,841
You know, to me, I'd love
to inspire, you know,

71
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:18,469
when I give a talk like this
and I see all these faces,

72
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:22,555
my really big hope is that
one person sees something

73
00:03:22,555 --> 00:03:24,908
in the words that are said today

74
00:03:24,908 --> 00:03:26,675
that makes them take this more serious.

75
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:28,528
Mainly, to be very honest with you,

76
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:31,405
from a selfish place that
I want you to email me

77
00:03:31,405 --> 00:03:35,301
in three years and say
in 2017 you were in Oslo,

78
00:03:35,301 --> 00:03:38,381
you said this about B to
B marketing on LinkedIn,

79
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:40,814
I finally listened, and this happened.

80
00:03:40,814 --> 00:03:43,695
I live a life where I get
hundreds of emails a day

81
00:03:43,695 --> 00:03:46,256
from entrepreneurs, B to
B companies, corporations.

82
00:03:46,256 --> 00:03:48,778
I had a guy fly in to a wine tasting I did

83
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:50,503
for my family business last week,

84
00:03:50,503 --> 00:03:53,909
his company went from $300,000
to $60 million in sales

85
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:56,321
in 18 months on the back of Facebook ads

86
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:57,940
and Instagram influencers.

87
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,410
I wish on all of you the
feeling it feels like

88
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,287
when you actually do something
nice for another human being

89
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:07,119
when you ask for nothing in
return, and you can build,

90
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:09,183
to your point, that legacy.

91
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:12,433
My friends, I have no vested interest

92
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:14,747
in this technology revolution.

93
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:17,264
I was super happy pre internet, I'm old.

94
00:04:17,264 --> 00:04:19,507
I turn 42 in a couple weeks.

95
00:04:19,507 --> 00:04:22,248
I lived pre internet, I
am not a technologist.

96
00:04:22,248 --> 00:04:24,705
I didn't own a computer
until I was 18 years old.

97
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:27,556
I don't give a shit about
gadgets, I don't like VR,

98
00:04:27,556 --> 00:04:30,291
I don't like AR, I don't like Facebook,

99
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,041
I only like one thing, attention.

100
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:37,217
(audience laughter)

101
00:04:37,217 --> 00:04:40,055
And so obviously it
manifests as a human being

102
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:42,760
and I like this feeling, and
I'm more comfortable right now

103
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,600
doing this than even in
any other environment.

104
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,611
But more importantly, I
like attention much more

105
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:49,735
on a macro.

106
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:52,990
Where do our customers spend their time,

107
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,206
and how do we create,
in those environments,

108
00:04:56,206 --> 00:04:58,393
to create the thing that we want.

109
00:04:58,393 --> 00:05:02,203
I started VaynerMedia seven years ago,

110
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:03,860
not with he intent to build an agency

111
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,468
and sell it to a holding company,

112
00:05:05,468 --> 00:05:07,296
I built it because I want to build

113
00:05:07,296 --> 00:05:11,463
a communications Death
Star, so that I can point it

114
00:05:11,463 --> 00:05:13,527
with any ambition I have.

115
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:15,172
Whether that's to sell a sneaker,

116
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:16,842
whether that's to raise money

117
00:05:16,842 --> 00:05:19,190
for my brother's Crohn's disease,

118
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,280
whether that's to help a friend become

119
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,358
the mayor of New York in 20 years,

120
00:05:23,358 --> 00:05:25,575
whether that's to sell a
t-shirt, a bottle of wine,

121
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,742
it's agnostic.

122
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,715
It's agnostic.

123
00:05:28,715 --> 00:05:32,084
Ultimately it's going to
be to use it for propaganda

124
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:34,499
to make everybody in
America a New York Jets

125
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:35,934
American Football fan.

126
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:40,383
But, for the time being, I
continue to hone these skills.

127
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:43,855
I sit here today believing
in Alexa's skills,

128
00:05:43,855 --> 00:05:47,427
and Amazon's big push
for Alexa and Google Home

129
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:50,591
and the future Apple Home
Pod, I believe in that space

130
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:53,508
not because it's showing ROI today,

131
00:05:54,408 --> 00:05:57,304
but my intuition on
consumer behavior tells me

132
00:05:57,304 --> 00:06:01,184
in 36 months, in 48 months,
every single person here

133
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:05,753
is going to interact with an
AI based speaker or device

134
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:08,872
and do search queries and buy products

135
00:06:08,872 --> 00:06:10,760
and interact in that environment.

136
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,326
We're living through, my
friends, let's take a step back.

137
00:06:13,326 --> 00:06:15,903
We're living through the biggest shift

138
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:19,673
in the way humans interact with each other

139
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:21,134
since the printing press.

140
00:06:21,134 --> 00:06:23,573
This internet thing is a big deal.

141
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:26,076
This is not about Facebook or Twitter

142
00:06:26,076 --> 00:06:27,732
or Instagram or Snapchat,

143
00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:31,607
this is about the internet
is finally at true scale,

144
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:35,131
and we're starting to really
understand it's impact.

145
00:06:35,131 --> 00:06:38,273
And it's having obviously
geopolitical impacts,

146
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:41,690
and I just feel that the audacity amongst

147
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:46,517
the B to B environment,
and GE is a client,

148
00:06:46,517 --> 00:06:48,228
and we do things with SAP,

149
00:06:48,228 --> 00:06:51,915
and I'm a start up investor
in tons of SAAS businesses

150
00:06:51,915 --> 00:06:52,949
and B to B business.

151
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:56,167
I think there's a gross misunderstanding

152
00:06:56,167 --> 00:07:00,105
on how much commerce and
actual business results

153
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:03,853
happen in the new environments
in a B to B world,

154
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:05,325
and let me explain.

155
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:08,993
The trick for the B to
B players in this room

156
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:11,122
is that they have to
understand the cadence

157
00:07:11,122 --> 00:07:13,673
on how they have to communicate
in this new environment

158
00:07:13,673 --> 00:07:16,447
that completely
differentiates from the way

159
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:18,963
that you would communicate
as a consumer product.

160
00:07:18,963 --> 00:07:21,860
For example, the way I think about

161
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,465
the haves and the have nots,

162
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:26,775
the binary people that believe
or don't believe right now

163
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:29,650
in this environment plays
out in a different way.

164
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:34,222
I call it headline readers
versus practitioners.

165
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:37,677
There's a lot of people here
who've read an article or two,

166
00:07:37,677 --> 00:07:40,460
who've talked to some people over dinner

167
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,214
and have enormous
opinions on what Facebook

168
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:47,134
or LinkedIn or Instagram
or blogging or a podcast

169
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,145
can do for their business,

170
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:53,089
yet they've never
executed a single podcast,

171
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:55,823
never ran a single Facebook ad,

172
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:58,322
and have never tried segmentation creative

173
00:07:58,322 --> 00:08:01,486
and media executions in
a LinkedIn environment.

174
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:04,319
The reason I keep a GaryVee brand,

175
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:07,787
besides the fact that I love attention,

176
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:11,277
is because I need to be a practitioner.

177
00:08:11,277 --> 00:08:13,057
In the green room before I came out here,

178
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:16,519
I literally posted on Instagram
and thoughtfully thought

179
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:19,092
about the hashtags that I was going to use

180
00:08:19,092 --> 00:08:20,925
to make sure that people discovered it.

181
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:25,830
I pondered the copy that was
going to support the video

182
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,532
that I was putting out, I
watched the video three times

183
00:08:29,532 --> 00:08:31,622
to catch the energy that I thought.

184
00:08:31,622 --> 00:08:35,105
I thought about the time
it was in New York City

185
00:08:35,105 --> 00:08:38,373
this morning, and that
L.A. would not see it

186
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:40,025
because it was going to be too early,

187
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:42,468
and more my European fans would.

188
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:46,830
The depth of thoughtfulness
on timing and creative

189
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,025
and cadence that I thought
about a single Instagram post

190
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:55,310
is completely poo-pooed by
the modern B to B environment,

191
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,863
it is not thought about at
any kind of strategic level,

192
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:03,535
and the reason that most
people fail in winning

193
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:05,975
in social media is because of

194
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:07,752
a couple of huge misconceptions.

195
00:09:07,752 --> 00:09:10,599
Number one, there is no social media.

196
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:14,515
Social media is a slang
term that we came up with

197
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:18,859
for the websites and
apps now that dominate

198
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:21,502
the end consumer's
attention in our society.

199
00:09:21,502 --> 00:09:24,025
If you're willing to look
at social media, the word,

200
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:28,192
the way I am, which is, the
apps that live on the cell phone

201
00:09:29,476 --> 00:09:32,355
that have most of the
attention of the human race

202
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:35,787
and is the current state
of the actual internet,

203
00:09:35,787 --> 00:09:39,215
all of a sudden, social
media doesn't feel so small

204
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:41,907
or a sprinkle, or a nice to have,

205
00:09:41,907 --> 00:09:44,509
or the thing that is coming.

206
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:48,558
Number two, I just don't think
people think it's a craft

207
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:51,064
or a strategy or an art
to the way that I do.

208
00:09:51,064 --> 00:09:55,066
It is far, somebody who has
run television, run print,

209
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:57,168
built his family's liquor store business

210
00:09:57,168 --> 00:09:59,421
on the back of email and Google.

211
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:02,472
As somebody who has lived
in marketing every day

212
00:10:02,472 --> 00:10:05,479
for the last 20 years,
there is has been nothing

213
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,282
more complicated or
difficult to be successful in

214
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:12,497
than social, because, especially
in a Facebook and LinkedIn

215
00:10:12,497 --> 00:10:16,121
environment where the
action for this room is,

216
00:10:16,121 --> 00:10:20,397
it is the birth child of
television and direct mail

217
00:10:20,397 --> 00:10:23,185
and Google all in one platform.

218
00:10:23,185 --> 00:10:26,033
Most people in the world of business today

219
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:28,526
have not quantified the difference between

220
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:31,398
marketing and branding and sales.

221
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:35,012
Most people either sit
on the side of math,

222
00:10:35,012 --> 00:10:37,073
and are quant based marketers,

223
00:10:37,073 --> 00:10:39,917
or sit on the side of art,

224
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:42,782
and are creative, subjective marketers,

225
00:10:42,782 --> 00:10:44,920
and they don't realize
that the mix of the two

226
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,952
and the discipline to respect
the tension of both sides

227
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:52,844
in today's environment is
the brilliance and need

228
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:54,275
to be successful.

229
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:56,738
And so as somebody who
has been a practitioner

230
00:10:56,738 --> 00:10:59,860
at attacking that skillset,
not only for myself,

231
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,001
but for the biggest brands in the world,

232
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:04,918
on the back of an 800 person agency

233
00:11:05,922 --> 00:11:08,428
that does all quant and qual work,

234
00:11:08,428 --> 00:11:10,603
I have a very unique perspective

235
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,250
and I'm very intrigued by it.

236
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,481
I'm very intrigued by how
many people think it is better

237
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:19,906
to spend money on a print
ad in a B to B magazine

238
00:11:19,906 --> 00:11:22,033
than it is to run Facebook ads.

239
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:24,148
I'm intrigued by so many people here

240
00:11:24,148 --> 00:11:28,174
that are so much quicker to
spend for the 8th year in a row

241
00:11:28,174 --> 00:11:32,238
25,000 euros to sponsor
a fucking conference.

242
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:35,238
(audience laughter)

243
00:11:37,388 --> 00:11:40,334
Instead of running $25,000
dollars of LinkedIn ads

244
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:42,834
against the employees of
companies that they're trying

245
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:46,309
to reach with creative that
would actually make them

246
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:49,027
intrigued or inspired
to do business with you.

247
00:11:49,027 --> 00:11:52,445
I am super intrigued by the fact,

248
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:56,015
how many people here
own their own business,

249
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,204
raise their hands.

250
00:11:57,204 --> 00:11:59,422
And how many do not?

251
00:11:59,422 --> 00:12:00,327
Fantastic.

252
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:04,246
I'm intrigued by the
difference of those two groups.

253
00:12:04,246 --> 00:12:07,092
I live in a world right
now which is broken up

254
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:09,635
between Silicon Valley, Madison Avenue,

255
00:12:09,635 --> 00:12:11,398
entrepreneurs and corporates.

256
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,941
I like them all very
much, I love all people,

257
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,127
and I especially love all business people.

258
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:19,455
But it is not the second
group of hands fault,

259
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:22,263
the employees, it is impossible,
you're a human being,

260
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:26,401
it is impossible for you to
spend the money of the company

261
00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:28,275
as if it was your own.

262
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:30,273
It's just not humanly possible.

263
00:12:30,273 --> 00:12:32,009
It's just not the way we're wired.

264
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:35,844
And I watch every day two
very distinct things happening

265
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:37,418
in the market today.

266
00:12:37,418 --> 00:12:40,843
Entrepreneurs, or people
that own their own business,

267
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,653
every day moving ungodly amounts of money,

268
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:47,075
into influencers, into
Facebook, into LinkedIn.

269
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:50,365
Not into, be careful here,
I am not a traditional

270
00:12:50,365 --> 00:12:52,672
versus digital debtor.

271
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:55,190
For example, I believe
that most of the money

272
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,795
spent today on digital is
going directly in the garbage,

273
00:12:58,795 --> 00:13:01,305
because most of the money in digital today

274
00:13:01,305 --> 00:13:04,759
is spent on programmatic
banner and pre-rolls

275
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:08,085
on websites that nobody's
paying attention to,

276
00:13:08,085 --> 00:13:10,145
and there's no context for the creative,

277
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:13,718
it's just hitting the CPM
value, or the impression value,

278
00:13:13,718 --> 00:13:15,757
it has nothing to do with
driving the business results.

279
00:13:15,757 --> 00:13:19,573
So this is not a traditional
media is dead, digital is here.

280
00:13:19,573 --> 00:13:23,740
I have more issues with most
digital, it's about today.

281
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:27,586
It's about day trading attention.

282
00:13:27,586 --> 00:13:30,773
It is you are trying to sell jet engines

283
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:34,604
or shipping supplies or a SAAS business,

284
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:37,815
and you have $10,000 to make that happen,

285
00:13:37,815 --> 00:13:39,861
what are you going to do with it,

286
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,760
and to me that's when
you need to understand

287
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,348
the day trading of attention.

288
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:46,116
What's under priced and
overpriced attention.

289
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,401
If you're in America and
you want to sell product

290
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:51,596
to an under 30 year old
kid, a pair of sneakers,

291
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:54,289
Snapchat should have 50% of your money,

292
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:57,897
regardless of how good of
a deal Snapchat's stock is,

293
00:13:57,897 --> 00:14:00,777
because that is the end
consumer's attention.

294
00:14:00,777 --> 00:14:03,865
And so, we're living through a time

295
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:06,124
where the biggest businesses in the world

296
00:14:06,124 --> 00:14:10,291
are vulnerable because
distribution of information

297
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,605
and products have been
commoditized by the internet.

298
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,427
The distribution of attention,

299
00:14:18,427 --> 00:14:21,551
or the information to us,
has been commoditized.

300
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:26,037
Nobody here was shooting
a satellite into space

301
00:14:26,037 --> 00:14:28,537
to start a TV network 20 years

302
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,992
with that capital
infrastructure, and the cameras,

303
00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:35,845
and the studios, but
literally every one of you

304
00:14:35,845 --> 00:14:39,199
in your pocket right
now has live television,

305
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,078
literally, for free, on
Facebook Live or Instagram Live.

306
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:45,860
I mean, it is remarkable,
we have completely

307
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,288
taken for granted,
completely taken for granted,

308
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:52,831
the power that we sit on
in our hands right now.

309
00:14:52,831 --> 00:14:55,066
The recording that you're doing right now

310
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:58,515
used to cost 10's of thousands
of dollars in equipment,

311
00:14:58,515 --> 00:15:00,364
literally just 30 years ago.

312
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:03,808
We are completely misunderstanding
where the attention is.

313
00:15:03,808 --> 00:15:07,543
We are misunderstanding the
single biggest opportunity

314
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:09,116
for every B to B company here,

315
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,236
and that is to act like a media company,

316
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:13,344
not an advertiser.

317
00:15:13,344 --> 00:15:15,339
The biggest problem for all
the B to B companies here is

318
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:18,272
that it's hard to
advertise B to B products.

319
00:15:18,272 --> 00:15:20,078
And so what happens when it's hard?

320
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:22,374
It becomes very vanilla.

321
00:15:22,374 --> 00:15:26,541
You show three people smiling
in a fucking office, right?

322
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:31,010
And you put it on a piece
of paper on page 87,

323
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,304
and you think something
good's going to happen

324
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:34,721
in 20 fucking 18.

325
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:37,615
It's what happens.

326
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:38,525
We know it.

327
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:42,930
Or you make a flyer and
you send it in the mail,

328
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,569
and you think that's a good idea in 2018.

329
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,431
How many people here can't
wait to leave this conference

330
00:15:47,431 --> 00:15:50,966
and go home and carefully go
through their direct mail.

331
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:52,294
(audience laughter)

332
00:15:52,294 --> 00:15:53,127
Yeah.

333
00:15:53,127 --> 00:15:58,005
So, so what happens is we have
no cadence or understanding

334
00:15:58,005 --> 00:16:01,462
or creative output, yet, everybody here

335
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:05,632
can take those same dollars
and do a six part miniseries

336
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:09,459
in audio form, and create
a six part documentary

337
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:13,440
in podcast form around the
behaviors in their industry,

338
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,521
or creative that's
interesting to their users.

339
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:18,478
For example, I have a lawyer friend

340
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,352
who's starting a golf podcast
because he's trying to reach

341
00:16:21,352 --> 00:16:23,283
high net worth individuals,

342
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,895
and a lot of them play golf.

343
00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:27,118
He's not starting a lawyer podcast,

344
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:29,775
because nobody wants to listen to that.

345
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:34,038
He's starting an interest
podcast as a gateway drug

346
00:16:34,038 --> 00:16:38,644
to his services, because
the law firm is bringing you

347
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:40,192
the golf information.

348
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:43,937
And so, if I can leave
with anything, if anything,

349
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:46,461
if I can get one of the hands that went up

350
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:49,408
from the B to B environment in this room,

351
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,377
if I can get one of them
to actually make the shift

352
00:16:52,377 --> 00:16:54,618
that in 2018 instead of spending

353
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:58,551
hundreds of thousands of
dollars on print and sponsorship

354
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:01,707
and direct mail as an advertiser,

355
00:17:01,707 --> 00:17:04,138
we're going to look at
the digital landscape

356
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:08,305
and become a media company
and bring value and interest

357
00:17:09,198 --> 00:17:13,089
to our perspective
clients as a gateway drug.

358
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,775
That would be a huge accomplishment

359
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:19,104
to make a little less altruistic
and lofty and confusing,

360
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,952
even if you just started
writing white papers

361
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:26,030
that were not sales release,
but were actually white papers.

362
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,346
If you get out of sales
and you get into branding,

363
00:17:29,346 --> 00:17:32,834
if you make a white paper
about trends in your industry

364
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:35,348
and why you're servicing them, right.

365
00:17:35,348 --> 00:17:38,534
If you made a white
paper that was 13 pages,

366
00:17:38,534 --> 00:17:40,972
thoughtful, smart, you
put energy behind it,

367
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:42,391
your best people behind it.

368
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:45,206
And you ran that on LinkedIn and Facebook

369
00:17:45,206 --> 00:17:49,366
against the employees, and
this is how you segment,

370
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:52,277
in an ad form, against the employees

371
00:17:52,277 --> 00:17:55,056
of the companies that you
aspire to do business with,

372
00:17:55,056 --> 00:17:56,999
you would see remarkable results.

373
00:17:56,999 --> 00:18:00,119
Because what attention is
most interesting to me.

374
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:02,062
How many people here have ever played in

375
00:18:02,062 --> 00:18:04,617
the real estate industry in their careers,

376
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,904
raise your hands, just curious.

377
00:18:06,904 --> 00:18:08,139
This is interesting to me.

378
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:10,461
I've started realizing huh,

379
00:18:10,461 --> 00:18:13,461
I'm acting and navigating this world

380
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,327
like I'm in the real estate business.

381
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:21,094
You're attention is no different
than real estate people

382
00:18:21,094 --> 00:18:24,504
look at new places, new
beach front properties,

383
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:28,738
emerging cities, trends within
cities that make you think

384
00:18:28,738 --> 00:18:30,694
the property is under priced.

385
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:32,988
All I do for a living every
day is what's under priced

386
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:36,125
and what's overpriced,
and market by market.

387
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:39,084
What's happening in Oslo that
isn't happening in New York.

388
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:40,487
Or what's happening in New York,

389
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:44,138
and one of the great, I
mean, unbelievable advantages

390
00:18:44,138 --> 00:18:46,014
of being in a market that is not the

391
00:18:46,014 --> 00:18:49,611
United States of America is
being able to watch the trends

392
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:52,343
and understanding which
ones will transfer and not.

393
00:18:52,343 --> 00:18:54,650
Not every app will pop in the Nordics

394
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,878
that pop in America, however,

395
00:18:56,878 --> 00:18:59,275
90% of all of this that I'm talking about

396
00:18:59,275 --> 00:19:01,192
is human, not cultural.

397
00:19:02,696 --> 00:19:04,750
These are human dynamics,
let me give you one.

398
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,500
Everybody here will give
up privacy for time.

399
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:13,300
Time is the pillar asset for us besides

400
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,633
health, money, and religion.

401
00:19:16,946 --> 00:19:17,878
Time.

402
00:19:17,878 --> 00:19:21,432
So, when I think about
audio and why I push you

403
00:19:21,432 --> 00:19:23,644
to thinking about a podcast,

404
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:25,732
is because if you're trying to reach

405
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:28,961
a high net worth individual,
or a decision maker

406
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,658
in a business that would
do business with you

407
00:19:30,658 --> 00:19:33,453
in a B to B environment, I'm
going to make the assumption,

408
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:36,904
that I think we all
can, is that she's busy.

409
00:19:36,904 --> 00:19:38,895
And what audio does, how many people here

410
00:19:38,895 --> 00:19:41,244
follow my content, raise your hands.

411
00:19:41,244 --> 00:19:42,079
Thank you.

412
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,692
Of the people that, keep your hands up,

413
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:45,757
I wanted the other people
to see this, thank you.

414
00:19:45,757 --> 00:19:47,661
Look around if you're in the front, okay.

415
00:19:47,661 --> 00:19:49,258
No it's not enough, don't worry,

416
00:19:49,258 --> 00:19:50,444
that's not what I'm saying.

417
00:19:50,444 --> 00:19:51,938
What I'm saying is watch now this.

418
00:19:51,938 --> 00:19:52,771
Okay, thank you.

419
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:55,654
Now, of those people, how
many of you in the last year

420
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:57,810
have started listening more to my podcast

421
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:01,581
and watching less of my
video, raise your hands?

422
00:20:01,581 --> 00:20:02,884
That.

423
00:20:02,884 --> 00:20:05,442
That's what I am most
intrigued by right now.

424
00:20:05,442 --> 00:20:06,553
To me, thank you.

425
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:10,386
To me, the fact that
technology in 2018 and 19

426
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:14,327
is moving us as humans
to act more like people

427
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:18,643
from the 1930's to 60's
and consume more radio,

428
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:21,507
because we have it on us,

429
00:20:21,507 --> 00:20:25,058
because we are subconsciously
trying to find more time,

430
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,725
because time is emerging as an asset

431
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,616
because we're getting
pounded with information.

432
00:20:29,616 --> 00:20:31,688
Because we are starting to get trained,

433
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:34,412
we grossly underestimate
the brain and human beings,

434
00:20:34,412 --> 00:20:37,210
we're starting to get trained
to listen to the podcast

435
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,043
and do something else.

436
00:20:40,163 --> 00:20:42,663
And so, I am betting on voice,

437
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,956
both podcast and Alexa
skills and Google Home

438
00:20:46,956 --> 00:20:49,417
and all those skills,

439
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:52,482
because I know that is the
thing we're going to buy into.

440
00:20:52,482 --> 00:20:56,257
One of my great misses in
my investment career, Uber,

441
00:20:56,257 --> 00:20:59,007
which I passed on twice in the angel round

442
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,738
at a four million dollar valuation,

443
00:21:00,738 --> 00:21:03,703
I invested in later at a
100 million dollar valuation

444
00:21:03,703 --> 00:21:06,938
because I realized Uber
wasn't selling transportation,

445
00:21:06,938 --> 00:21:10,377
Uber was selling the perception of time.

446
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:12,654
When you hit that button,
you're able to go on

447
00:21:12,654 --> 00:21:14,848
and do what you're doing
until it gets there,

448
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:17,807
and that was the remarkable insight.

449
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:21,681
So much of what you do every
day, the things you value.

450
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:24,179
Do you know why you don't
unsubscribe from emails

451
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,759
that you have no interest in getting?

452
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:27,592
Time.

453
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:30,656
It takes you longer to
unsubscribe to the email

454
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:34,245
than it does to just
delete it or swipe it out.

455
00:21:34,245 --> 00:21:37,018
Time is driving so much of our behavior,

456
00:21:37,018 --> 00:21:41,159
and in the B to B environment,
in the B to B environment,

457
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:44,409
it is emerging more to me strategically

458
00:21:45,456 --> 00:21:48,908
because the decision makers
we're desperate to reach

459
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:51,106
value time even more,

460
00:21:51,106 --> 00:21:54,177
and that's why they will not
go through their direct mail.

461
00:21:54,177 --> 00:21:57,297
That is why they will not go
through a magazine carefully

462
00:21:57,297 --> 00:21:59,368
and stumble on your advertisement.

463
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:01,445
Can we, Oslo, can we make a deal.

464
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,480
Can you not buy a print
fucking ad next year.

465
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,471
(audience laughter)

466
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:07,264
I mean I'm sitting here and
I'm talking, and I'm like,

467
00:22:07,264 --> 00:22:08,559
then the other part of my brain is like,

468
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,818
yeah this is so ridiculous,

469
00:22:09,818 --> 00:22:13,314
like how the fuck you
buy a print ad in 2018,

470
00:22:13,314 --> 00:22:15,141
it makes no sense.

471
00:22:15,141 --> 00:22:16,724
It's so overpriced.

472
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,131
Do you know that you pay
eight to 12 times circulation

473
00:22:22,131 --> 00:22:24,616
as the CPM cost for a print ad,

474
00:22:24,616 --> 00:22:28,854
in case Jorge leaves
the magazine on the bus,

475
00:22:28,854 --> 00:22:30,944
and Susan picks it up and goes to page

476
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:34,112
90 fucking seven and sees your ad.

477
00:22:34,112 --> 00:22:37,202
The lack of practically is so obnoxious.

478
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:40,586
Yet, there are people here
who comfortably buy print ads

479
00:22:40,586 --> 00:22:42,290
because that's what we've always done

480
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:46,457
while asking what the ROI
of Facebook and LinkedIn is.

481
00:22:47,302 --> 00:22:50,351
Just incredible times, and
you will see some of the

482
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:53,720
biggest companies in the
world over the next decade

483
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,252
completely vanish off
the face of the earth

484
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:59,469
because of their misallocation
and their misunderstanding

485
00:22:59,469 --> 00:23:02,517
of where the consumer's attention is.

486
00:23:02,517 --> 00:23:04,285
They will not understand.

487
00:23:04,285 --> 00:23:05,997
They will go out of business.

488
00:23:05,997 --> 00:23:08,644
This is happening, it's
happening faster than you think,

489
00:23:08,644 --> 00:23:10,136
you see it all around the world.

490
00:23:10,136 --> 00:23:11,530
I was in Singapore last week,

491
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,368
the number two magazine media
company shut down it's print.

492
00:23:14,368 --> 00:23:15,677
It's happening every single day.

493
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:17,775
In America, Toys "R" Us,
the biggest toy retailer,

494
00:23:17,775 --> 00:23:20,735
out of business, out of business.

495
00:23:20,735 --> 00:23:22,864
This is happening every single day

496
00:23:22,864 --> 00:23:24,477
and will continue to accelerate,

497
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:26,971
and I'm stunned that I go to a dinner

498
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:30,086
every night of the week where
for the first 30 minutes

499
00:23:30,086 --> 00:23:33,758
a 70 year old executive
will want to talk to me

500
00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:36,560
for 30 minutes how he
or she cannot believe

501
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,419
that Facebook has changed
the election in the U.S.,

502
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,302
changed the Brexit, it's unbelievable.

503
00:23:43,302 --> 00:23:47,531
They should shut it down,
we need laws, this is crazy,

504
00:23:47,531 --> 00:23:50,350
it's too powerful, it's super scary,

505
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,957
what about our grandchildren.

506
00:23:51,957 --> 00:23:54,371
And then we will transition
to the 30 minutes

507
00:23:54,371 --> 00:23:57,016
of the business talk
and they'll say to me,

508
00:23:57,016 --> 00:24:00,095
but my customers aren't on Facebook.

509
00:24:00,095 --> 00:24:02,422
(audience laughter)

510
00:24:02,422 --> 00:24:03,758
That's what I do every time, too,

511
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:05,220
I throw up directly on them.

512
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,698
(audience laughter)

513
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:10,698
(audience applause)

514
00:24:12,454 --> 00:24:17,073
It's time, it's time we have
the proper conversation,

515
00:24:17,073 --> 00:24:19,521
which is the following.

516
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:22,369
Most things that we grew
up with five years ago,

517
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:27,045
banner ads and pre-rolls
included, are overpriced.

518
00:24:27,045 --> 00:24:28,649
It's not that anything's dead.

519
00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:30,550
And I hate when people
are like, TV's dead.

520
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:33,961
TV's not dead, you know, radio's not dead,

521
00:24:33,961 --> 00:24:35,871
they're overpriced.

522
00:24:35,871 --> 00:24:38,557
What you pay for is not what you get.

523
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:41,520
Meanwhile, everybody in
here will read an article

524
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,687
in six years that says 2012
to 2019 was a golden era

525
00:24:46,748 --> 00:24:49,699
of Facebook Ads, and you
should have done more.

526
00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:53,145
And now that they're $48
CPM instead of $7 CPM,

527
00:24:53,145 --> 00:24:56,593
you'll regret and you'll be sad, right.

528
00:24:56,593 --> 00:24:58,198
That's what happened to me.

529
00:24:58,198 --> 00:24:59,505
When I get introduced and people say,

530
00:24:59,505 --> 00:25:01,266
he built his dad's liquor
store from three to

531
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:05,245
60 million dollars, and
everybody's like, I get sad.

532
00:25:05,245 --> 00:25:08,326
Because I spent too much
money on print and outdoor

533
00:25:08,326 --> 00:25:10,760
and radio and all the other things,

534
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,561
even though it was staring me in the face

535
00:25:13,561 --> 00:25:16,894
that Google, for five and
10 and 11 cents a click

536
00:25:16,894 --> 00:25:18,934
was driving unbelievable ROI.

537
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,721
I took it for granted, I was
too young and didn't understand

538
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:24,099
how good of a deal it was,

539
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:26,783
and that's why I stand
passionately up here today

540
00:25:26,783 --> 00:25:30,470
and tell you every penny you
can afford to put into Facebook

541
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,998
and create videos and
pictures to make it work,

542
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:35,522
every penny you can afford
for the B to B players

543
00:25:35,522 --> 00:25:38,270
to put into LinkedIn
and create white papers

544
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,724
and videos for them, every
penny you can afford.

545
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:44,389
Because you will go back
and look at this era,

546
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:47,464
much like many of you did with
Google in the early 2000's,

547
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:50,419
and then you did it in 2010 and 12 and 15,

548
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:53,111
and you're like, and you caught up.

549
00:25:53,111 --> 00:25:55,657
The problem was, now you're
paying the appropriate price,

550
00:25:55,657 --> 00:25:57,662
you're not stealing it like everybody did

551
00:25:57,662 --> 00:26:01,083
from 2001-2006, that is what's happening.

552
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:04,940
Either I'm right or I'm wrong,
it will play itself out.

553
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,182
But I will tell you this.

554
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:10,071
When I see, how many of
you are familiar with Wish,

555
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:12,518
the shopping app, raise your hands.

556
00:26:12,518 --> 00:26:14,185
Wow, that in itself.

557
00:26:15,344 --> 00:26:18,174
18 months ago if I asked that question,

558
00:26:18,174 --> 00:26:19,333
four hands would have put up.

559
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,661
One more time, how many of
you are familiar with Wish?

560
00:26:21,661 --> 00:26:24,471
How many of you have
boughten something off Wish?

561
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:26,148
Fuck, this all makes sense.

562
00:26:26,148 --> 00:26:27,660
Listen to this.

563
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,612
Wish, in the last seven
years, or six years,

564
00:26:30,612 --> 00:26:34,296
has gone from zero,
zero, to anywhere between

565
00:26:34,296 --> 00:26:37,310
three to five billion dollars in sales.

566
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:40,389
It is probably the most
emerging, most important retailer

567
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:42,423
in the world, that most people don't know.

568
00:26:42,423 --> 00:26:47,354
Yet, it is a top 50 app in
every single app store country

569
00:26:47,354 --> 00:26:49,187
on Apple in the world.

570
00:26:50,488 --> 00:26:53,770
All of their money, all of their
money until this last year,

571
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,116
where they put some branding
on the Lakers jersey's

572
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:00,210
and on the Mayweather
McGregor fight in the corner,

573
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,388
all of their money for the last six years

574
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:04,871
has been spent on Facebook.

575
00:27:04,871 --> 00:27:07,142
And these were engineers
that were employees

576
00:27:07,142 --> 00:27:09,114
from Google and left.

577
00:27:09,114 --> 00:27:10,041
Why?

578
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:12,863
Because they saw the pattern
recognition that I saw,

579
00:27:12,863 --> 00:27:14,893
which was Amazon.

580
00:27:14,893 --> 00:27:17,498
Amazon was Google's biggest advertiser

581
00:27:17,498 --> 00:27:19,664
in the early days of Google.

582
00:27:19,664 --> 00:27:21,607
And they used that under price attention

583
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,482
to build a monster company.

584
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:25,882
And that's exactly what
these Wish founders did.

585
00:27:25,882 --> 00:27:28,357
They knew that Google was
under priced for those years,

586
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:30,747
they knew that Facebook was
the new under priced model.

587
00:27:30,747 --> 00:27:32,916
They went all in, all in,

588
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:34,691
and they bought under priced attention,

589
00:27:34,691 --> 00:27:37,370
acquired customers at
a under priced nature,

590
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,974
and built against that momentum.

591
00:27:38,974 --> 00:27:43,141
That environment is still
available for the next 24 months

592
00:27:44,535 --> 00:27:46,147
for the majority of this room,

593
00:27:46,147 --> 00:27:48,619
including the people
that are practitioners

594
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:51,345
and understand that you
can target employees

595
00:27:51,345 --> 00:27:54,071
of organizations on Facebook,

596
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:58,129
and I highly recommend that
you do not take this talk

597
00:27:58,129 --> 00:28:01,203
for granted, and you go
back home after today,

598
00:28:01,203 --> 00:28:02,748
and you start Googling,

599
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:06,031
how do I run Facebook ads
for my B to B SAAS list.

600
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:07,686
How do I do this, how do I do that.

601
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:11,303
The tactics are commoditized,
you can Google it at home.

602
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:15,470
The mindset to understand what
year we're actually living in

603
00:28:16,391 --> 00:28:19,969
is the punchline of this conversation.

604
00:28:19,969 --> 00:28:21,268
Thank you.

605
00:28:21,268 --> 00:28:24,268
(audience applause)

606
00:28:27,012 --> 00:28:29,021
- Awesome, Gary, awesome.

607
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:30,567
My friend Rick bought me this.

608
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:31,424
- I like this.

609
00:28:31,424 --> 00:28:33,002
- Yeah, it's a Jets hat.

610
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:33,865
- I like the Jets.

611
00:28:33,865 --> 00:28:36,241
- And I realized that it
doesn't really make any sense

612
00:28:36,241 --> 00:28:37,147
to give it to you.

613
00:28:37,147 --> 00:28:37,980
- Okay.

614
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,255
- Because you probably
have thousands of them.

615
00:28:40,255 --> 00:28:41,976
- I have 7,000 of them yes.

616
00:28:41,976 --> 00:28:43,281
- But I still have it, so.

617
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:44,997
- Should we sign it and
give it to somebody else?

618
00:28:44,997 --> 00:28:46,034
- That's cool, yeah.

619
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:46,998
- Yeah, we'll do that. Okay.

620
00:28:46,998 --> 00:28:47,914
- We'll do that.

621
00:28:47,914 --> 00:28:49,122
- Okay.
- Okay, cool.

622
00:28:49,122 --> 00:28:50,237
So sit down here please.

623
00:28:50,237 --> 00:28:51,070
- Sure.

624
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,294
- Some water, Red Bull.

625
00:28:52,294 --> 00:28:53,616
We're going to have a
lot of fun with these,

626
00:28:53,616 --> 00:28:54,533
by the way.

627
00:28:55,507 --> 00:28:56,655
You've heard about this, Catchbox?

628
00:28:56,655 --> 00:28:58,115
- Of course.

629
00:28:58,115 --> 00:28:59,592
I fucking speak every day.

630
00:28:59,592 --> 00:29:01,175
- You're so trendy.

631
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:03,394
Sorry.

632
00:29:03,394 --> 00:29:04,251
- No worries

633
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:08,418
- Okay, so, we are going to
have a little conversation

634
00:29:09,568 --> 00:29:11,632
and then you guys can
already start thinking

635
00:29:11,632 --> 00:29:14,716
about all the cool questions
you're going to ask.

636
00:29:14,716 --> 00:29:16,065
But I just want to start.

637
00:29:16,065 --> 00:29:16,898
- Please.

638
00:29:16,898 --> 00:29:18,205
- First of all, welcome back to Oslo.

639
00:29:18,205 --> 00:29:19,038
- Thank you.

640
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:19,871
- How are you feeling.

641
00:29:19,871 --> 00:29:20,704
- Great, great.
- Yeah?

642
00:29:20,704 --> 00:29:21,955
- Thank you so much guys, for the energy.

643
00:29:21,955 --> 00:29:22,934
Really appreciated it.

644
00:29:22,934 --> 00:29:25,934
(audience applause)

645
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:31,024
- So the room is filled
with business people.

646
00:29:31,024 --> 00:29:31,857
- Yep.

647
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:35,335
- And as we talked about
before you hit the stage,

648
00:29:35,335 --> 00:29:38,733
Norway's quite ahead in terms of digital.

649
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:39,623
- 100%.

650
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:43,174
- Snapchat is bigger than Instagram here.

651
00:29:43,174 --> 00:29:45,703
And I would say the average Norwegian

652
00:29:45,703 --> 00:29:47,358
uses social a lot.

653
00:29:47,358 --> 00:29:48,191
- [Gary] I agree.

654
00:29:48,191 --> 00:29:52,904
- But still, I get the vibe
from the advertising industry

655
00:29:52,904 --> 00:29:54,792
that a lot of businesses
are still very behind

656
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:59,104
on investing in Facebook
ads, Google AdWords,

657
00:29:59,104 --> 00:30:01,382
all that jazz, as you
were just describing,

658
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,862
over 70 year old dinner meetings

659
00:30:03,862 --> 00:30:05,332
with 70 year old people.

660
00:30:05,332 --> 00:30:06,771
- And you know why that is, right?

661
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:07,604
- Tell me.

662
00:30:07,604 --> 00:30:10,572
- It's not a Norwegian thing,
it's not a Nordic thing,

663
00:30:10,572 --> 00:30:11,918
it's a global thing.

664
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:13,992
It's because the biggest holding companies

665
00:30:13,992 --> 00:30:16,720
that are the fortified
biggest holding companies

666
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,377
in the advertising industry, the WPP's,

667
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:21,074
the Omnicom's, the Publicis,

668
00:30:21,074 --> 00:30:22,916
these are publicly traded companies

669
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:25,563
who should be driving
their business results,

670
00:30:25,563 --> 00:30:27,224
not their clients results,

671
00:30:27,224 --> 00:30:31,288
are always selling things that
they make the most margin on,

672
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:34,487
which is television and
programmatic digital,

673
00:30:34,487 --> 00:30:37,314
and then they will support
it with bullshit reports

674
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:40,203
that are an inside the game dynamic

675
00:30:40,203 --> 00:30:43,596
to justify the spend, and
they are extracting the value

676
00:30:43,596 --> 00:30:45,554
out of the biggest companies in the world,

677
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:47,931
so they feel comfortable with the reports

678
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:50,837
and the bullshit fucking
metrics that they measure on

679
00:30:50,837 --> 00:30:52,233
internal MMM's.

680
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:55,408
And so it's a complete inside,
did you see the Big Short,

681
00:30:55,408 --> 00:30:56,644
the movie the Big Short?

682
00:30:56,644 --> 00:30:57,477
- Yeah, yeah.

683
00:30:57,477 --> 00:30:59,330
- That's what's happening
in the advertising world.

684
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,867
Everybody's in on it.

685
00:31:00,867 --> 00:31:02,918
The company's are fucking getting fucked,

686
00:31:02,918 --> 00:31:04,452
they're gonna lose.

687
00:31:04,452 --> 00:31:07,118
The biggest media companies are getting

688
00:31:07,118 --> 00:31:09,606
bigger and bigger and bigger
and more and more profitable,

689
00:31:09,606 --> 00:31:12,106
and that's why it's happening.

690
00:31:12,946 --> 00:31:15,929
- So, basically, they should
fire their agencies then?

691
00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:19,123
- Um, no, I don't think
it's their agency's fault,

692
00:31:19,123 --> 00:31:20,900
I think it's their fault.

693
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,824
- [Interviewer] Right.

694
00:31:21,824 --> 00:31:24,590
- Agencies aren't stealing their money.

695
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,333
They're giving the agencies the money.

696
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:27,551
- [Interviewer] That's true, so.

697
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:29,249
- I think what should
happen is we should start

698
00:31:29,249 --> 00:31:32,879
changing the way we compensate the C-Suite

699
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:34,718
of the biggest companies in the world,

700
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:37,223
because all of them are
making decisions based on

701
00:31:37,223 --> 00:31:39,443
what the stock price is when they leave

702
00:31:39,443 --> 00:31:41,799
so they can liquidate and buy their yacht,

703
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:46,723
not if Red Bull's going
to be around for 30 years.

704
00:31:46,723 --> 00:31:48,665
- [Interviewer] Damn.

705
00:31:48,665 --> 00:31:49,902
(audience applause)

706
00:31:49,902 --> 00:31:50,855
- And you know what's funny.

707
00:31:50,855 --> 00:31:51,706
- Yeah?

708
00:31:51,706 --> 00:31:53,910
- They all know it.

709
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,886
I was watching, you guys all know it.

710
00:31:55,886 --> 00:31:59,736
I mean, I know I'm right,
and you know I'm right.

711
00:31:59,736 --> 00:32:01,993
Now, that doesn't mean anything.

712
00:32:01,993 --> 00:32:03,464
Doesn't mean it's going to change.

713
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:06,224
It just means there's
an opportunity, right.

714
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:09,516
When companies that have
a lot more money than you

715
00:32:09,516 --> 00:32:12,965
are throwing 95% of their
money directly in the garbage,

716
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:15,254
you have a change of winning.

717
00:32:15,254 --> 00:32:19,404
Wine.com had 114 million
dollars in fundraising

718
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:23,365
when I had $14,000 in advertising in 1997.

719
00:32:23,365 --> 00:32:25,190
I beat them.

720
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,574
Why?

721
00:32:26,574 --> 00:32:29,374
Because I did the right
thing for the business,

722
00:32:29,374 --> 00:32:31,124
not because I was an executive

723
00:32:31,124 --> 00:32:34,136
trying to maximize my personal wealth.

724
00:32:34,136 --> 00:32:35,190
- Right.

725
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,082
Do you then think that, like,

726
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:39,522
entrepreneurs and small
businesses have a bigger chance

727
00:32:39,522 --> 00:32:40,881
to win now than ever?

728
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:41,881
- 100%.

729
00:32:43,232 --> 00:32:44,394
It's happening.

730
00:32:44,394 --> 00:32:46,057
This is not me predicting.

731
00:32:46,057 --> 00:32:47,261
What the fuck do you think has happened

732
00:32:47,261 --> 00:32:48,856
in the last 10 years?

733
00:32:48,856 --> 00:32:51,840
This is the greatness era because money,

734
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,977
let's say you want to
start a toothpaste brand.

735
00:32:55,977 --> 00:32:57,280
You're passionate about toothpaste.

736
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,422
You want to make more
all natural toothpaste,

737
00:32:59,422 --> 00:33:00,588
and you want to sell it.

738
00:33:00,588 --> 00:33:03,697
You can now sell that
direct to consumer at scale

739
00:33:03,697 --> 00:33:05,573
at a level we've never seen before,

740
00:33:05,573 --> 00:33:07,850
but if you wanted to
start that 25 years ago,

741
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,027
the amount of money you had to pay Tesco

742
00:33:10,027 --> 00:33:12,729
or Saintsbury, or Wal-Mart,
just for trade dollars,

743
00:33:12,729 --> 00:33:15,385
distribution, like of course.

744
00:33:15,385 --> 00:33:17,586
And then if you actually
run Snapchat and Instagram

745
00:33:17,586 --> 00:33:20,875
and Facebook influencer
ads instead of billboards

746
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:23,921
or print or direct mail,
I mean, absolutely.

747
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:27,171
This is an incredible time
to act like an entrepreneur,

748
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,777
whether you're an
entrepreneur or a corporation.

749
00:33:30,777 --> 00:33:34,065
And when I say act like an
entrepreneur, you're scared.

750
00:33:34,065 --> 00:33:36,367
You know, the reason I
became a great marketer,

751
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:38,790
was because the marketing
was for my dad's liquor store

752
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:41,571
and that's how my family ate.

753
00:33:41,571 --> 00:33:44,508
I wasn't going for Cannes Lion Awards.

754
00:33:44,508 --> 00:33:46,727
I wasn't looking at reports every 90 days

755
00:33:46,727 --> 00:33:49,985
that were metrics on
the brand health lift.

756
00:33:49,985 --> 00:33:53,161
This was about fucking selling pinot noir.

757
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:55,948
And so I got very disciplined

758
00:33:55,948 --> 00:33:58,376
that marketing had to
do something for you,

759
00:33:58,376 --> 00:34:02,543
not make you feel good about
justifying that you're a CMO.

760
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:07,854
- Right, and I saw you at
Cannes Lions this year,

761
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:12,429
just like other big agencies.

762
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:15,948
So, the things you're preaching
and you're communicating

763
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:20,116
to us today, how, I mean,
acting like all the others.

764
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,645
Going to Cannes, having
meetings, having parties,

765
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,472
all that kind of things.

766
00:34:26,472 --> 00:34:29,202
How do you make sure
that your whole company

767
00:34:29,202 --> 00:34:31,572
are kind of communicating
the same things you are doing

768
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:34,370
and making them understand
how to prioritize

769
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:37,442
the client's budgets in a different way?

770
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:38,972
- Dictatorship.

771
00:34:38,972 --> 00:34:41,056
(audience laughter)

772
00:34:41,056 --> 00:34:42,684
- Sounds like fun.

773
00:34:42,685 --> 00:34:43,981
- It is fun.

774
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:47,362
I mean, especially when
you're pushing good.

775
00:34:47,362 --> 00:34:48,844
It's super fun.

776
00:34:48,844 --> 00:34:51,246
If I see tendencies from a leader,

777
00:34:51,246 --> 00:34:54,408
Eric here who's in the
front and runs our UK office

778
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:56,779
and most of our European activities.

779
00:34:56,779 --> 00:35:00,291
If I get any indication that
Eric is pushing something

780
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:03,227
that is in the short
term value of VaynerMedia

781
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:05,321
because he wants the P
and L of the London office

782
00:35:05,321 --> 00:35:08,620
to look better and he knows
that the client will buy this,

783
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,288
but it's not on message,
he won't have a job,

784
00:35:11,288 --> 00:35:12,815
and he knows that.

785
00:35:12,815 --> 00:35:14,314
And it's not, that's not bad.

786
00:35:14,314 --> 00:35:16,410
That's just to make sure we don't lose.

787
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,584
Like, to me, I'm not
scared to go to conferences

788
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:19,749
and have a party.

789
00:35:19,749 --> 00:35:21,258
To me that's a framework.

790
00:35:21,258 --> 00:35:23,578
You know, that's like being a human being,

791
00:35:23,578 --> 00:35:24,663
we're all the same.

792
00:35:24,663 --> 00:35:26,385
It's about what's coming out of our mouths

793
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:27,737
and what our actions are.

794
00:35:27,737 --> 00:35:30,555
I am met with a lot of cynicism.

795
00:35:30,555 --> 00:35:31,662
You said it.

796
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,305
You expect much, you'll love this.

797
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:36,599
How many people here
when they first saw me

798
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,895
or consumed my content,
thought I was a douche bag

799
00:35:38,895 --> 00:35:42,245
or completely full of
shit, raise your hands.

800
00:35:42,245 --> 00:35:44,948
Right, so like, I'm aware of that.

801
00:35:44,948 --> 00:35:46,957
And the good news is
that doesn't cripple me,

802
00:35:46,957 --> 00:35:49,753
because I can deliver or I can't.

803
00:35:49,753 --> 00:35:51,404
Either you're right or I'm right.

804
00:35:51,404 --> 00:35:53,127
And that's kind of how I
feel about Vayner right.

805
00:35:53,127 --> 00:35:55,768
Like I'm not worried
about going to Cannes,

806
00:35:55,768 --> 00:35:58,367
because I go to Cannes and
have this conversation.

807
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:03,347
You know, having sizzle, or
looking like everybody else

808
00:36:03,347 --> 00:36:05,364
in the front is irrelevant.

809
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:07,272
It's the execution on the backend

810
00:36:07,272 --> 00:36:10,382
that is going to ultimately
be the case, right.

811
00:36:10,382 --> 00:36:11,428
- [Interviewer] Yeah, absolutely.

812
00:36:11,428 --> 00:36:12,759
- When you and I took
that picture years ago,

813
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:15,946
I was amongst other social media experts

814
00:36:15,946 --> 00:36:18,588
that were charlatans that
were going to take opportunity

815
00:36:18,588 --> 00:36:20,259
in this short window.

816
00:36:20,259 --> 00:36:23,144
I laughed because I was already
a 33 year old businessman

817
00:36:23,144 --> 00:36:25,088
who'd already built an actual business,

818
00:36:25,088 --> 00:36:28,309
I wasn't a real estate agent
six months earlier, right.

819
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:32,194
I just truly believed that the
attention of all these people

820
00:36:32,194 --> 00:36:33,877
was going to be in these things.

821
00:36:33,877 --> 00:36:37,744
There's videos of me, you know, in 2013,

822
00:36:37,744 --> 00:36:39,520
a hell of a lot chubbier, saying like,

823
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,323
Snapchat's going to happen,
either I'm right or I'm wrong.

824
00:36:42,323 --> 00:36:43,855
This is not, you know, super complicated.

825
00:36:43,855 --> 00:36:47,246
I said here, it's on video,
that voice is going to matter,

826
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,079
and all of you are going to interact

827
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,329
with speakers in four years.

828
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:52,327
And if you don't, people are
going to pull up those videos

829
00:36:52,327 --> 00:36:54,962
and say don't listen to Gary,
look how wrong he's been.

830
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,379
So I don't predict, you know,

831
00:36:58,732 --> 00:37:00,387
every time there's new app,

832
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:02,224
I don't do what a lot of other people do,

833
00:37:02,224 --> 00:37:03,452
and just say this is going to be big

834
00:37:03,452 --> 00:37:04,893
and hope one of them is.

835
00:37:04,893 --> 00:37:06,990
I don't fucking guess, I don't hope.

836
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,415
I fucking work and I execute.

837
00:37:09,415 --> 00:37:12,144
- [Interviewer] Sure, I like that.

838
00:37:12,144 --> 00:37:15,144
(audience applause)

839
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:19,213
When we tweeted out that
you're going to visit us today,

840
00:37:19,213 --> 00:37:23,286
I got a lot of questions
about VaynerMedia in Europe

841
00:37:23,286 --> 00:37:24,564
and in the Nordics.

842
00:37:24,564 --> 00:37:25,895
Can you maybe share a little bit

843
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:26,988
about your plans there?

844
00:37:26,988 --> 00:37:30,738
- Look, we have ambition
to service the globe

845
00:37:31,913 --> 00:37:34,099
in a 40 year macro.

846
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:37,847
And so, you know, obviously,
a lot of people in Nordics

847
00:37:37,847 --> 00:37:39,911
saw what we did with ArticStartup,

848
00:37:39,911 --> 00:37:44,078
and we have 10 teammates
coming to Helsinki in January,

849
00:37:45,066 --> 00:37:46,655
like we're looking at
this part of the world

850
00:37:46,655 --> 00:37:48,444
very feverishly.

851
00:37:48,444 --> 00:37:51,952
I'm a very big fan of the time
I've spent in the Nordics.

852
00:37:51,952 --> 00:37:53,228
And I'll be, you know, look.

853
00:37:53,228 --> 00:37:54,807
I think a lot of you do watch my content.

854
00:37:54,807 --> 00:37:56,475
I don't go to every place
and be like, I like you.

855
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:57,945
I do like this place.

856
00:37:57,945 --> 00:38:00,160
There's a really, you know,
it's interesting right.

857
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,037
So I'm funny with Europe
because I disrespect it,

858
00:38:05,037 --> 00:38:06,842
because even though I was born in Belarus

859
00:38:06,842 --> 00:38:08,677
and born in Eastern Europe, like,

860
00:38:08,677 --> 00:38:12,006
there's, like I'm a work ethic guy.

861
00:38:12,006 --> 00:38:14,150
And I'm very empathetic
to like work life balance

862
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:17,304
and quality of life, I don't
just anybody's opinion.

863
00:38:17,304 --> 00:38:20,313
But like, in business,
I do think work ethic

864
00:38:20,313 --> 00:38:22,295
is super hardcore important,

865
00:38:22,295 --> 00:38:25,742
and I think certain parts
of the world have it

866
00:38:25,742 --> 00:38:27,617
too extreme and work
too hard, and I think,

867
00:38:27,617 --> 00:38:30,271
I think New York is one
of them, I really do.

868
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:31,740
Even though I work harder than them,

869
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,295
I can take back a step
subjectively and go, that's a lot.

870
00:38:35,295 --> 00:38:37,957
And then there's other parts of the world

871
00:38:37,957 --> 00:38:41,225
that don't work at all,
like Greece and shit, right.

872
00:38:41,225 --> 00:38:43,024
(audience laughter)

873
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:44,774
And I'm like, you're
fucking losers, right.

874
00:38:44,774 --> 00:38:47,580
And so, but it's been interesting.

875
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:50,488
And I've been to the
Nordics maybe 12, 13 times.

876
00:38:50,488 --> 00:38:52,307
I think there's an
interesting cadence here,

877
00:38:52,307 --> 00:38:54,123
I think there's interesting brands here,

878
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,764
I think there's interesting
businesses here,

879
00:38:55,764 --> 00:38:58,330
and we have real ambitions.

880
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,684
Obviously for people
that follow me the most,

881
00:39:00,684 --> 00:39:03,049
they saw that I kind of
ran my mouth and said

882
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:07,155
we'll be in Singapore in
2018 with VaynerMedia,

883
00:39:07,155 --> 00:39:09,570
which I would say is 95% accurate.

884
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,506
And so, we're looking at Southeast Asia

885
00:39:11,506 --> 00:39:13,711
very aggressively right now.

886
00:39:13,711 --> 00:39:15,575
But, over the next 20 years,

887
00:39:15,575 --> 00:39:19,742
the Vayner brand will have a
flag in every sector, right.

888
00:39:20,922 --> 00:39:24,052
You know, South America and
Africa, we will be everywhere.

889
00:39:24,052 --> 00:39:26,496
And so, we will be here.

890
00:39:26,496 --> 00:39:27,407
- Cool.

891
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:28,899
- Timing, I don't know.

892
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:29,836
- Cool.

893
00:39:29,836 --> 00:39:33,699
And so, I started referring
to the jab jab method

894
00:39:33,699 --> 00:39:35,422
when I work with my clients.

895
00:39:35,422 --> 00:39:38,371
Focus on giving value
and the right to market,

896
00:39:38,371 --> 00:39:40,758
is that still a very
important thing to focus on

897
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:43,548
in your opinion, and what
are the big lines of advice

898
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,279
you usually give to your
clients, like high level.

899
00:39:46,279 --> 00:39:47,568
- For a lot of people that don't know,

900
00:39:47,568 --> 00:39:48,898
I wrote a book several years ago called

901
00:39:48,898 --> 00:39:50,574
Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook.

902
00:39:50,574 --> 00:39:53,430
Give, give, give, and then ask.

903
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,914
I think a lot of people
when they put out content

904
00:39:55,914 --> 00:39:59,726
are ask, ask, ask, ask, or
take, take, take, take, right.

905
00:39:59,726 --> 00:40:02,546
I think what has really
worked for me and the clients

906
00:40:02,546 --> 00:40:04,360
that I've worked with and the start ups

907
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,121
that I've worked with is
when you actually give value,

908
00:40:06,121 --> 00:40:08,140
and a lot of times people
think they're giving value,

909
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,811
but if you look carefully
it's selfish, right.

910
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:12,029
So these are nuances.

911
00:40:12,029 --> 00:40:14,563
But yeah, I think it's
never been more important

912
00:40:14,563 --> 00:40:17,084
to be what I would call consumer centric.

913
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:18,804
A lot of people here talk in boardrooms

914
00:40:18,804 --> 00:40:20,502
about being consumer centric,

915
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:24,961
but advertising in general
already is not consumer centric.

916
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:28,681
You want to steal my time to
tell me how good your soda is.

917
00:40:28,681 --> 00:40:31,478
That's not inherently consumer centric.

918
00:40:31,478 --> 00:40:35,860
And so, more than ever
I believe in empathy.

919
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:40,027
I think empathy is the secret
drug of success in our society

920
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:43,832
both as a leader, when you're a boss,

921
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:46,343
and definitely when you
think about the consumer.

922
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:48,774
And I think that the trait of empathy

923
00:40:48,774 --> 00:40:51,925
that I took from my mother is no question,

924
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:55,151
maybe outside of competitiveness
that I took from my dad,

925
00:40:55,151 --> 00:40:58,311
the core reason why I sit here today.

926
00:40:58,311 --> 00:41:00,983
And if anything I would tell
you if I wrote it again,

927
00:41:00,983 --> 00:41:01,838
I would it call it,

928
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:05,698
Jab, Jab, Jab, Jab, Jab,
Jab, Jab, Right Hook.

929
00:41:05,698 --> 00:41:07,375
It's just more important because

930
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:08,677
there's so much being thrown out, right.

931
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:11,874
As the supply of content and noise grows,

932
00:41:11,874 --> 00:41:15,593
you have to differentiate
with more value, not less.

933
00:41:15,593 --> 00:41:18,835
And so, again, trying to
speak to the people here

934
00:41:18,835 --> 00:41:20,075
who have been following me,

935
00:41:20,075 --> 00:41:23,041
you've seen in the last
18 months compared to

936
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:25,674
the prior five years,
I've been more aggressive

937
00:41:25,674 --> 00:41:29,242
of putting out free
information and good content.

938
00:41:29,242 --> 00:41:33,398
In written, in audio, in
video, in multiple shows.

939
00:41:33,398 --> 00:41:35,831
Like I'm going harder to bring value

940
00:41:35,831 --> 00:41:37,192
because I felt like it was the only way

941
00:41:37,192 --> 00:41:39,509
that I could separate and
create the opportunities

942
00:41:39,509 --> 00:41:41,969
that I wanted for myself, was basically,

943
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:44,319
I basically think I'm
trying to guilt people

944
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,351
into being interested in what I'm doing

945
00:41:46,351 --> 00:41:50,410
by providing so much more
value with nothing in return

946
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:53,149
that it almost creates a level of guilt.

947
00:41:53,149 --> 00:41:54,732
- Yeah, I see that.

948
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:59,378
I've noticed that you've switched from,

949
00:41:59,378 --> 00:42:03,318
you're a lot more motivational
in your content now,

950
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:04,852
then you were earlier.
- I agree.

951
00:42:04,852 --> 00:42:08,151
- And I remember that you
said in an interview once,

952
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,640
that you're very afraid of being looked at

953
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,456
as a motivational speaker.
- Desperately fearful, yes.

954
00:42:12,456 --> 00:42:14,849
- So, what changed?
- Why did I do it?

955
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:18,734
I built another 150 million
dollar revenue a year business

956
00:42:18,734 --> 00:42:20,934
and it made me feel good
that if you called me

957
00:42:20,934 --> 00:42:23,951
a motivational speaker,
I would say, that's fine.

958
00:42:23,951 --> 00:42:25,717
But have you been paying
attention to the fact

959
00:42:25,717 --> 00:42:29,101
that I grew the fastest
growing agency in the industry

960
00:42:29,101 --> 00:42:30,178
in parallel.

961
00:42:30,178 --> 00:42:32,973
So by building an actual business,

962
00:42:32,973 --> 00:42:36,228
and by actually being a
CEO, and by actually again,

963
00:42:36,228 --> 00:42:39,101
not just Wine Library, but
now again a second time,

964
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:40,414
building something.

965
00:42:40,414 --> 00:42:41,465
You know, listen.

966
00:42:41,465 --> 00:42:44,692
It's not easy to build
something from zero dollars

967
00:42:44,692 --> 00:42:48,706
and zero cents to 150
million dollars in revenue,

968
00:42:48,706 --> 00:42:51,873
not valuation, in a seven year window.

969
00:42:52,721 --> 00:42:54,744
That takes operational skill.

970
00:42:54,744 --> 00:42:57,701
And so if you don't see
that that's what I've done,

971
00:42:57,701 --> 00:42:58,879
well then that's okay.

972
00:42:58,879 --> 00:43:02,503
But what has allowed me
to be more motivational is

973
00:43:02,503 --> 00:43:05,636
the lack of fear that that was
the only thing I was doing.

974
00:43:05,636 --> 00:43:06,969
I am optimistic.

975
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:10,451
- [Interviewer] So you got
more confidence and proof.

976
00:43:10,451 --> 00:43:11,350
- 100%.

977
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,538
I felt like I had, you
know, and don't forget

978
00:43:13,538 --> 00:43:15,333
how I figured out the drock thing, right.

979
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:17,412
He's just filming me, I'm living my life.

980
00:43:17,412 --> 00:43:19,074
It's not like I'm doing that.

981
00:43:19,074 --> 00:43:21,660
GaryVee is my side hustle.

982
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:26,470
Gary Vaynerchuk CEO of a
large enterprise is what I do,

983
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,603
and so yes I felt more
comfortable, confident,

984
00:43:28,603 --> 00:43:31,702
that I could speak a little
bit to the motivation,

985
00:43:31,702 --> 00:43:33,789
because the truth is it's really scary.

986
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:36,452
It's, you know, the way I gave this talk.

987
00:43:36,452 --> 00:43:39,285
The tactics are very commoditized.

988
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,442
It's the mindset which gets
into motivational aspects

989
00:43:44,442 --> 00:43:46,399
that is so imperative,
because you're trying

990
00:43:46,399 --> 00:43:49,039
to break through
insecurities in individuals

991
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:52,278
that lack the courage to do something

992
00:43:52,278 --> 00:43:54,430
and are crippled by fear
because they're worried

993
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:55,968
about other people's opinions.

994
00:43:55,968 --> 00:43:58,348
I'm trying to push so hard.

995
00:43:58,348 --> 00:44:01,866
I'm basically trying to be their courage

996
00:44:01,866 --> 00:44:06,035
so they can blame me if they
fail, which I'm fine with,

997
00:44:06,035 --> 00:44:08,674
I just want them to do.

998
00:44:08,674 --> 00:44:10,612
- [Interviewer] Yeah, and you
think it's easier for people

999
00:44:10,612 --> 00:44:12,812
to do things they're scared
of if they can blame you

1000
00:44:12,812 --> 00:44:14,016
at the end if it didn't work.

1001
00:44:14,016 --> 00:44:14,861
- 100%.

1002
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:15,818
I really mean that.

1003
00:44:15,818 --> 00:44:19,485
And I'm okay with that
because I think that,

1004
00:44:20,372 --> 00:44:22,445
I think that people
don't understand how much

1005
00:44:22,445 --> 00:44:25,962
they're going to regret
when they're older.

1006
00:44:25,962 --> 00:44:27,650
I also think a lot of executives here

1007
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:30,280
are going to get fired in six
years for being conservative,

1008
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,809
even though that's what their company's

1009
00:44:31,809 --> 00:44:32,875
telling them to do.

1010
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:35,531
They're going to be the
fall guy and the fall gal

1011
00:44:35,531 --> 00:44:37,231
when the company starts faltering,

1012
00:44:37,231 --> 00:44:40,240
just like the CMO of Under Armour

1013
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,734
was just pushed out
yesterday, I met with him,

1014
00:44:42,734 --> 00:44:45,141
he was very conservative,
the company was telling him

1015
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:47,879
to be conservative, but
when it hurt Under Armour,

1016
00:44:47,879 --> 00:44:50,757
he's the one that's getting
killed, not the CEO.

1017
00:44:50,757 --> 00:44:52,715
So a bunch of people here
are going to be out of a job,

1018
00:44:52,715 --> 00:44:54,991
they think they're being
smart and a political animal

1019
00:44:54,991 --> 00:44:56,429
and they're going to get promoted.

1020
00:44:56,429 --> 00:44:59,002
What they don't realize is
that the market's changing

1021
00:44:59,002 --> 00:45:00,746
on them and when everybody looks at them

1022
00:45:00,746 --> 00:45:02,846
and they were the ones pushing bullshit,

1023
00:45:02,846 --> 00:45:05,085
because the company wanted
them to pull bullshit,

1024
00:45:05,085 --> 00:45:06,450
they're going to get fired,

1025
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,590
and I don't want that to happen to them,

1026
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:10,266
so I'm trying to get them
to die on their sword,

1027
00:45:10,266 --> 00:45:11,685
instead of somebody else's.

1028
00:45:11,685 --> 00:45:14,368
And I'm trying to focus on
getting them to tell the truth

1029
00:45:14,368 --> 00:45:15,988
instead of what they think they need to do

1030
00:45:15,988 --> 00:45:18,969
to get another bonus this year.

1031
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:21,289
(audience applause).

1032
00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:23,234
- [Interviewer] Cool.

1033
00:45:23,234 --> 00:45:24,923
- Thank you, and the
reason they're clapping

1034
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:27,341
is they know how true
what I just said was.

1035
00:45:27,341 --> 00:45:28,607
(audience laughter)

1036
00:45:28,607 --> 00:45:30,367
And you're clapping yet conflicted,

1037
00:45:30,367 --> 00:45:32,115
and I'm empathetic, I
don't think I'm cool,

1038
00:45:32,115 --> 00:45:33,233
I don't think you're bad,

1039
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:35,122
I just want to have these conversations

1040
00:45:35,122 --> 00:45:36,878
so you can be thoughtful.

1041
00:45:36,878 --> 00:45:37,737
Right?

1042
00:45:37,737 --> 00:45:39,165
Like maybe it's time to have the courage

1043
00:45:39,165 --> 00:45:40,593
to say what you actually believe.

1044
00:45:40,593 --> 00:45:41,739
Because let me tell you something,

1045
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:45,659
getting killed on somebody
else's thesis sucks.

1046
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,326
You'd rather go down with yours.

1047
00:45:51,953 --> 00:45:53,598
(audience laughter)

1048
00:45:53,598 --> 00:45:55,602
It's the big one, it's the big one.

1049
00:45:55,602 --> 00:45:58,383
It's the one that, again, that's
why the reaction happened.

1050
00:45:58,383 --> 00:46:01,256
If I can just give people
courage to go into a meeting

1051
00:46:01,256 --> 00:46:03,580
tomorrow and go, you know what.

1052
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,393
First of all, they may
not have the skillset

1053
00:46:05,393 --> 00:46:07,424
of understanding Facebook
or Snapchat filters

1054
00:46:07,424 --> 00:46:08,603
or whatever it may be.

1055
00:46:08,603 --> 00:46:10,625
First, you gotta motivate them to go home

1056
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:14,384
and read and watch and
get educated, right.

1057
00:46:14,384 --> 00:46:18,603
But if they're here at all,
they're already ahead of 99%.

1058
00:46:18,603 --> 00:46:21,123
If they even are here, I've already got.

1059
00:46:21,123 --> 00:46:24,565
When I speak, I'm not speaking
in the middle of Red Square,

1060
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:27,010
hoping I can convince a
couple Russians, right.

1061
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:29,668
I'm in conferences where
people have already come,

1062
00:46:29,668 --> 00:46:31,997
you're already on third base.

1063
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,781
Now it's just which way
are you going to go.

1064
00:46:33,781 --> 00:46:35,062
Are you going to go back,

1065
00:46:35,062 --> 00:46:36,541
or is this the moment
you're going to go forward.

1066
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:40,708
And I take a huge, I'm flattered
that I was invited here.

1067
00:46:41,714 --> 00:46:45,881
I feel obligated to give my
best thoughts and efforts here,

1068
00:46:46,874 --> 00:46:50,364
and so that's why I speak
and communicate the way I do.

1069
00:46:50,364 --> 00:46:51,764
I'm playing for legacy.

1070
00:46:51,764 --> 00:46:52,931
- I like that.

1071
00:46:55,153 --> 00:46:57,720
So, I noticed kind of a pattern interrupt

1072
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:02,215
in what you've been doing
with Planet of the Apps.

1073
00:47:02,215 --> 00:47:05,122
So, for those of you guys who don't know,

1074
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,124
it's your show on Apple Music.

1075
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,707
And I would just love your,

1076
00:47:09,707 --> 00:47:13,475
because it's more
traditional media, kind of.

1077
00:47:13,475 --> 00:47:15,845
I'd love to just hear your thoughts on.

1078
00:47:15,845 --> 00:47:16,945
- Why I did it?

1079
00:47:16,945 --> 00:47:21,688
- Why I did it and if you got
what you wanted out of it.

1080
00:47:21,688 --> 00:47:24,060
- I got what I wanted out of it.

1081
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,209
Not all of what I wanted out of it,

1082
00:47:26,209 --> 00:47:29,744
but I did it because I love
doing things that are win win,

1083
00:47:29,744 --> 00:47:31,207
no matter what happens.

1084
00:47:31,207 --> 00:47:33,623
It's why I did the sneaker.

1085
00:47:33,623 --> 00:47:34,853
And I'll explain that as well.

1086
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:36,419
But I'll stay to your question.

1087
00:47:36,419 --> 00:47:39,043
The reason I did that is
because the other three people

1088
00:47:39,043 --> 00:47:43,248
that were my guests, that were my mentors,

1089
00:47:43,248 --> 00:47:45,934
are fucking famous as shit, you know.

1090
00:47:45,934 --> 00:47:49,267
And by being the fourth, by being Ringo,

1091
00:47:50,456 --> 00:47:53,873
but knowing that I was John or Paul,

1092
00:47:53,873 --> 00:47:55,892
was a very good strategy, right.

1093
00:47:55,892 --> 00:47:58,410
I knew it was a subject matter that I had

1094
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:00,590
much more expertise at, right.

1095
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:02,801
I knew that I was going
to be good on camera,

1096
00:48:02,801 --> 00:48:04,414
because I am good on
camera, just I'd never done

1097
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:06,043
a television show.

1098
00:48:06,043 --> 00:48:07,915
And I thought the whole time that Apple

1099
00:48:07,915 --> 00:48:09,909
would never release it on Apple Music,

1100
00:48:09,909 --> 00:48:11,047
because I thought that was awkward,

1101
00:48:11,047 --> 00:48:12,690
why would you watch a show on Apple Music,

1102
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,773
we didn't get, you know, I don't
like to fight the consumer,

1103
00:48:14,773 --> 00:48:15,924
as I was saying in the green room.

1104
00:48:15,924 --> 00:48:17,038
You do what the consumer does.

1105
00:48:17,038 --> 00:48:19,144
So the whole time, you
know, it took a year

1106
00:48:19,144 --> 00:48:20,957
after we signed to coming out.

1107
00:48:20,957 --> 00:48:22,751
The whole time I'm like, okay.

1108
00:48:22,751 --> 00:48:24,516
They're going to create
something called Apple,

1109
00:48:24,516 --> 00:48:26,054
there going to do something with Apple TV,

1110
00:48:26,054 --> 00:48:28,031
or they're going to create
Apple Entertainment,

1111
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:29,362
or they're going to buy Netflix.

1112
00:48:29,362 --> 00:48:32,016
Like the whole time I thought, there's no,

1113
00:48:32,016 --> 00:48:34,548
literally til like the
week before the show aired,

1114
00:48:34,548 --> 00:48:36,614
I'm like, there's no way
they're going to distribute this

1115
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:38,698
on Apple Music, so the reason
I didn't get everything

1116
00:48:38,698 --> 00:48:40,626
is because it was on Apple Music,

1117
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,203
and that was awkward, they didn't watch,

1118
00:48:43,203 --> 00:48:45,292
even though it was in
every country in the world.

1119
00:48:45,292 --> 00:48:49,063
What I did get, was in 10
episodes for Hollywood,

1120
00:48:49,063 --> 00:48:53,226
I put on film that I'm
a celebrity, I'm a star,

1121
00:48:53,226 --> 00:48:55,507
and I'm worth doing business with.

1122
00:48:55,507 --> 00:48:58,766
And the level of business deals
that I've been offered to do

1123
00:48:58,766 --> 00:49:01,496
any business show I want
on the biggest networks

1124
00:49:01,496 --> 00:49:02,983
in the world has been remarkable.

1125
00:49:02,983 --> 00:49:07,150
Now, ironically, I am so
excited about what's going on

1126
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,838
with VaynerX, you know I bought PureWow,

1127
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:13,620
I created a holding company, VaynerMedia,

1128
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,499
and I think the stakes
are so high based on what

1129
00:49:16,499 --> 00:49:17,971
I've been talking about
with the opportunity

1130
00:49:17,971 --> 00:49:19,646
what the holding companies are doing,

1131
00:49:19,646 --> 00:49:21,835
that I'm, I was about to say I'm probably,

1132
00:49:21,835 --> 00:49:23,952
I'm not going to do a TV show next year,

1133
00:49:23,952 --> 00:49:25,644
like I thought I would.

1134
00:49:25,644 --> 00:49:26,854
Even though the offers are better

1135
00:49:26,854 --> 00:49:28,544
than I could have even imagined.

1136
00:49:28,544 --> 00:49:30,772
Because I have to stay
disciplined and be the operator,

1137
00:49:30,772 --> 00:49:32,940
because the opportunity is to great,

1138
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,286
and so I'm going to see that through.

1139
00:49:34,286 --> 00:49:35,564
But, it was great.

1140
00:49:35,564 --> 00:49:38,444
And also, I love doing firsts.

1141
00:49:38,444 --> 00:49:41,858
Apple is going to figure
out original programming.

1142
00:49:41,858 --> 00:49:45,264
And one day I'll be siting at, bro.

1143
00:49:45,264 --> 00:49:47,450
(audience laughter)

1144
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:48,950
I get it, respect.

1145
00:49:50,906 --> 00:49:52,239
- [Interviewer] Tough crowd, eh?

1146
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,821
- Yeah, he better be taking a shit.

1147
00:49:54,821 --> 00:49:57,560
(audience laughter)

1148
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,350
I know, which is even better.

1149
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:03,517
I wish everybody fucking left
right now and went to work.

1150
00:50:05,476 --> 00:50:07,496
I like that I'll be able
to be here in seven years

1151
00:50:07,496 --> 00:50:08,474
at this conference.

1152
00:50:08,474 --> 00:50:10,469
We'll be talking about
how all the networks died

1153
00:50:10,469 --> 00:50:13,253
and OTT won, and I'll be able
to make a reference like,

1154
00:50:13,253 --> 00:50:16,024
yeah you know, when I did
the first show on Apple.

1155
00:50:16,024 --> 00:50:16,857
- [Interviewer] Right.

1156
00:50:16,857 --> 00:50:18,198
- That has value.

1157
00:50:18,198 --> 00:50:19,183
And that's how I think.

1158
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,035
So it was all upside.

1159
00:50:21,035 --> 00:50:21,868
All upside.

1160
00:50:21,868 --> 00:50:24,309
By traditional TV, if I
did a regular TV show,

1161
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:27,912
like I was offered a ton,
and it failed, for ratings,

1162
00:50:27,912 --> 00:50:30,509
in theory the way this did.

1163
00:50:30,509 --> 00:50:32,261
Then I'd have nothing.

1164
00:50:32,261 --> 00:50:35,823
Here, I siphoned the brand equity

1165
00:50:35,823 --> 00:50:38,247
and had, and I'm completely
on a different pedestal

1166
00:50:38,247 --> 00:50:41,379
in Hollywood because I'm
with the other famous people.

1167
00:50:41,379 --> 00:50:44,035
It was a show that was
around my strengths,

1168
00:50:44,035 --> 00:50:46,870
so I was disproportionally better on it,

1169
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:48,341
so it was a win win.

1170
00:50:48,341 --> 00:50:50,585
It's very smart to do business things

1171
00:50:50,585 --> 00:50:52,942
where there is no downside.

1172
00:50:52,942 --> 00:50:55,768
(audience laughter)

1173
00:50:55,768 --> 00:50:58,503
- So, two seconds about your
shoes before my last question.

1174
00:50:58,503 --> 00:50:59,821
- Yes.

1175
00:50:59,821 --> 00:51:01,972
Literally the same exact thing.

1176
00:51:01,972 --> 00:51:02,805
- Yeah?

1177
00:51:02,805 --> 00:51:06,577
- Sure, it's the, you know,
out of a top 10 sneaker brand,

1178
00:51:06,577 --> 00:51:08,999
it's the first collaboration
where an entrepreneur

1179
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:12,416
has a shoe, not an athlete or a musician.

1180
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:16,539
If it works, then I get to always say

1181
00:51:16,539 --> 00:51:20,361
that I had the first
business sneaker, right.

1182
00:51:20,361 --> 00:51:21,194
Right?

1183
00:51:21,194 --> 00:51:24,509
If it doesn't work, my best
friends get to make fun of me

1184
00:51:24,509 --> 00:51:26,259
for having a big ego.

1185
00:51:27,307 --> 00:51:30,519
- So last question before
we open up for the audience.

1186
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:31,832
So, you talk a lot about legacy.

1187
00:51:31,832 --> 00:51:32,665
- Yes.

1188
00:51:32,665 --> 00:51:34,291
- And you're talking about legacy

1189
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,242
being greater than currency.

1190
00:51:36,242 --> 00:51:37,075
- I do.

1191
00:51:37,075 --> 00:51:39,125
- What do you mean by that?

1192
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:41,491
- I'd rather be remembered
as a tremendous human being

1193
00:51:41,491 --> 00:51:43,907
than make a couple extra dollars.

1194
00:51:43,907 --> 00:51:45,838
I leave money on the table every day.

1195
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:47,797
Way more than people would realize.

1196
00:51:47,797 --> 00:51:50,599
Like, my assistants, my
admins, my lawyers, my agents,

1197
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:52,229
they're always freaked out.

1198
00:51:52,229 --> 00:51:54,439
Because I make decisions
that are going to look good

1199
00:51:54,439 --> 00:51:57,213
when I'm dead, versus making
an extra seven million

1200
00:51:57,213 --> 00:51:58,801
dollars a year this year.

1201
00:51:58,801 --> 00:52:02,718
And so, when I made
$100,000 a year, I made it.

1202
00:52:04,351 --> 00:52:05,965
I came from nothing, you know.

1203
00:52:05,965 --> 00:52:08,171
When you're an immigrant and
you live in a studio apartment

1204
00:52:08,171 --> 00:52:10,463
with seven family members
and you've got nothing.

1205
00:52:10,463 --> 00:52:14,084
When your parents buy you
seven toys your entire life

1206
00:52:14,084 --> 00:52:15,614
and you had to buy the rest of them,

1207
00:52:15,614 --> 00:52:17,719
when you went on one family vacation

1208
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:19,559
in your entire childhood, like,

1209
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:21,815
you're coming from a different place.

1210
00:52:21,815 --> 00:52:25,690
So, like I said, when
I made $100,000 a year

1211
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:28,561
for the first time, when
Wine Library got bigger,

1212
00:52:28,561 --> 00:52:30,598
I was like, phew, I made it.

1213
00:52:30,598 --> 00:52:33,655
So for me, I'm not driven by the money.

1214
00:52:33,655 --> 00:52:35,614
The money will be there,
the money's there now

1215
00:52:35,614 --> 00:52:38,398
at a level that I am super excited about.

1216
00:52:38,398 --> 00:52:41,503
I know I want to buy the Jets,
but it's the chase of trying

1217
00:52:41,503 --> 00:52:42,920
far more than it.

1218
00:52:43,808 --> 00:52:47,013
And I think I was,
listen, when I talk about

1219
00:52:47,013 --> 00:52:48,904
what I think I have that's special,

1220
00:52:48,904 --> 00:52:51,935
I don't think that's an ego or confidence,

1221
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:54,711
I think that's, that's giving my parents

1222
00:52:54,711 --> 00:52:57,544
and being an immigrant a pedestal.

1223
00:52:58,402 --> 00:52:59,890
When I talk about being good,

1224
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:01,716
I think that's me flattering my parents.

1225
00:53:01,716 --> 00:53:03,857
What did I do about it?

1226
00:53:03,857 --> 00:53:07,401
You know, my kids, my
businesses I feel pride in.

1227
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:08,495
Me?

1228
00:53:08,495 --> 00:53:10,051
That's my parents work.

1229
00:53:10,051 --> 00:53:12,394
That's America's capitalism at work.

1230
00:53:12,394 --> 00:53:14,182
That's being an immigrant at work.

1231
00:53:14,182 --> 00:53:16,441
I have nothing to do with the admiration

1232
00:53:16,441 --> 00:53:20,223
that I have for people, so
it keeps me very grounded.

1233
00:53:20,223 --> 00:53:22,919
The reason I was nice, you
know, when people meet me,

1234
00:53:22,919 --> 00:53:24,502
is I didn't do anything.

1235
00:53:24,502 --> 00:53:26,572
I'm the byproduct of Sasha and Tamara,

1236
00:53:26,572 --> 00:53:29,343
they should be running
around acting big shots.

1237
00:53:29,343 --> 00:53:33,245
I'm fucking, just, you
know, trying to deliver

1238
00:53:33,245 --> 00:53:36,553
on the gifts, and I'm
driven, completely fueled,

1239
00:53:36,553 --> 00:53:38,861
completely fueled on gratitude.

1240
00:53:38,861 --> 00:53:41,479
I'm so grateful for my circumstances,

1241
00:53:41,479 --> 00:53:42,942
and that's why I want to give back.

1242
00:53:42,942 --> 00:53:44,308
I feel guilty.

1243
00:53:44,308 --> 00:53:45,934
The reason I understand out of guilt,

1244
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:47,107
is because I feel that guilt

1245
00:53:47,107 --> 00:53:49,543
for having such an unbelievable mother.

1246
00:53:49,543 --> 00:53:52,244
I feel that guilt for being born.

1247
00:53:52,244 --> 00:53:53,077
Thank you.

1248
00:53:53,077 --> 00:53:55,634
(audience applause)

1249
00:53:55,634 --> 00:53:57,550
For being born with talents to communicate

1250
00:53:57,550 --> 00:53:58,404
that touch people.

1251
00:53:58,404 --> 00:54:02,571
I feel guilty for struggling,
which created a skin

1252
00:54:03,936 --> 00:54:07,360
that makes all your opinions matter to me

1253
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,854
and not matter to me at the same time.

1254
00:54:09,854 --> 00:54:12,697
And so, yeah, I really want legacy.

1255
00:54:12,697 --> 00:54:14,046
To be very honest with you,

1256
00:54:14,046 --> 00:54:15,745
because I feel I was built for it.

1257
00:54:15,745 --> 00:54:18,801
Like I, you know, I don't like saying it,

1258
00:54:18,801 --> 00:54:21,272
because it does sound so douchey,

1259
00:54:21,272 --> 00:54:23,689
but I think I'll be all time.

1260
00:54:24,662 --> 00:54:26,554
(audience laughter)

1261
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:27,387
- I love that.

1262
00:54:27,387 --> 00:54:28,235
- And let me tell you why,

1263
00:54:28,235 --> 00:54:29,771
because I haven't even started.

1264
00:54:29,771 --> 00:54:31,738
I'm 41 years old, like.

1265
00:54:31,738 --> 00:54:36,105
I have 40, 50 years of
work to put into the world.

1266
00:54:36,105 --> 00:54:40,761
And for you and others here,
you've seen what's happened

1267
00:54:40,761 --> 00:54:42,986
in one year, compared to a year ago.

1268
00:54:42,986 --> 00:54:46,144
The momentum is so exponential,
and that's how it works.

1269
00:54:46,144 --> 00:54:48,501
Right, it builds, and it builds.

1270
00:54:48,501 --> 00:54:51,202
And what I have is real and it's honest

1271
00:54:51,202 --> 00:54:53,866
and I really genuinely
want to give them 51,

1272
00:54:53,866 --> 00:54:55,656
because I know what to do with the 49%,

1273
00:54:55,656 --> 00:54:58,906
and I watch everybody
else and they want 80,

1274
00:54:58,906 --> 00:55:01,787
and they want 90, and they want 100.

1275
00:55:01,787 --> 00:55:03,444
And that's why I'll beat them.

1276
00:55:03,444 --> 00:55:04,297
- I like that.

1277
00:55:04,297 --> 00:55:07,880
So, you said you had
that I made it moment.

1278
00:55:09,459 --> 00:55:10,292
- Yeah.

1279
00:55:10,292 --> 00:55:12,150
- Many many years ago.

1280
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:15,021
Do you still have those moments.

1281
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:18,080
Are you still, I know you're grateful,

1282
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,283
but are you still having
those kind of moments?

1283
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:23,830
- And even that one was
kind of like whatever.

1284
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:25,396
I'm not good at smelling the roses.

1285
00:55:25,396 --> 00:55:26,229
- No.

1286
00:55:26,229 --> 00:55:28,947
- But I, to your question,
it's an interesting thought,

1287
00:55:28,947 --> 00:55:30,622
and I think it affects people around me,

1288
00:55:30,622 --> 00:55:31,958
that's why I think about it.

1289
00:55:31,958 --> 00:55:35,125
For me, playing the game is the roses.

1290
00:55:37,006 --> 00:55:39,974
The process, the struggle, the failures,

1291
00:55:39,974 --> 00:55:41,728
is the stuff that gets me going.

1292
00:55:41,728 --> 00:55:45,210
Not the accolades, the awards, the money.

1293
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,770
I like the game.

1294
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:50,646
I liked four sports teams
in America growing up.

1295
00:55:50,646 --> 00:55:53,039
My baseball team and hockey
team won a championship

1296
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:54,500
and I stopped caring.

1297
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,544
My football team and my
basketball team still haven't,

1298
00:55:57,544 --> 00:55:58,874
and I care quite a bit.

1299
00:55:58,874 --> 00:56:00,213
That's me.

1300
00:56:00,213 --> 00:56:03,245
I want the climb, I want struggle.

1301
00:56:03,245 --> 00:56:05,742
And I've been successful,
and I think most people

1302
00:56:05,742 --> 00:56:08,872
are successful when they are
in it for the right reasons.

1303
00:56:08,872 --> 00:56:11,894
And if you're an entrepreneur,
the right reasons

1304
00:56:11,894 --> 00:56:13,663
are getting punched in the face.

1305
00:56:13,663 --> 00:56:16,168
You get punched in the face
everyday as an entrepreneur,

1306
00:56:16,168 --> 00:56:19,484
everything's on you, it's
lonely, it's very difficult.

1307
00:56:19,484 --> 00:56:21,272
It's been good the last eight years

1308
00:56:21,272 --> 00:56:22,915
because the world economy's good,

1309
00:56:22,915 --> 00:56:24,411
wait until it gets bad again.

1310
00:56:24,411 --> 00:56:26,083
A lot of these kids don't know yet,

1311
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:27,657
they don't know what it feels
like when the world melts,

1312
00:56:27,657 --> 00:56:29,679
the money dries up, and
you still gotta survive.

1313
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:32,526
And I've been through two
of those cycles already.

1314
00:56:32,526 --> 00:56:34,189
And like, I'm looking
forward to the next one.

1315
00:56:34,189 --> 00:56:36,021
I can't wait for the world to melt.

1316
00:56:36,021 --> 00:56:38,578
Because all of the C and D
and B players get eliminated

1317
00:56:38,578 --> 00:56:41,703
and go get jobs, and I like that.

1318
00:56:41,703 --> 00:56:44,480
That's merit, that's
capitalism, that's the game.

1319
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,279
And so, I don't smell the
roses when things happen,

1320
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:50,322
because I think I'm smelling the roses

1321
00:56:50,322 --> 00:56:52,264
in real time every day.

1322
00:56:52,264 --> 00:56:53,550
- I like that.

1323
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:54,524
Ready for some questions?

1324
00:56:54,524 --> 00:56:55,473
- I am.

1325
00:56:55,473 --> 00:56:57,767
- All right, people.

1326
00:56:57,767 --> 00:57:00,139
Can we change the lighting
so we can actually see

1327
00:57:00,139 --> 00:57:02,056
all the people as well?

1328
00:57:03,067 --> 00:57:06,400
And Dominic, I'll give it to you, catch.

1329
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:09,760
- [Gary] That's fancy.

1330
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,593
- [Audience Member] Hi Gary.

1331
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:11,426
- [Gary] How are you, my friend.

1332
00:57:11,426 --> 00:57:12,475
- I'm good, love you.

1333
00:57:12,475 --> 00:57:14,711
- [Gary] I love you too
man, thanks for the hoodie.

1334
00:57:14,711 --> 00:57:15,878
One life baby.

1335
00:57:17,444 --> 00:57:20,522
- I'm curious, you talk always about,

1336
00:57:20,522 --> 00:57:22,324
you talk always about speed.

1337
00:57:22,324 --> 00:57:23,796
It is important.
- [Gary] Yes, very.

1338
00:57:23,796 --> 00:57:25,291
- [Audience Member] Hiring is important

1339
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:27,191
and firing is even more important.

1340
00:57:27,191 --> 00:57:28,024
- 100%.

1341
00:57:28,024 --> 00:57:29,981
- [Audience Member] What is
the process in VaynerMedia?

1342
00:57:29,981 --> 00:57:33,397
How long do you, does it take
for you to fire a person.

1343
00:57:33,397 --> 00:57:35,474
- Somebody just got approved to be fired

1344
00:57:35,474 --> 00:57:37,281
in 90 days today.

1345
00:57:37,281 --> 00:57:41,590
Other people, I've been
agonizing for 18 months.

1346
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:44,556
There's no one size fits all, right.

1347
00:57:44,556 --> 00:57:49,043
There's two forces, there's
me as an individual,

1348
00:57:49,043 --> 00:57:51,651
as the dictator, as
the CEO, as the leader.

1349
00:57:51,651 --> 00:57:54,583
And then there's the
collective leadership, right.

1350
00:57:54,583 --> 00:57:56,798
And I try to counterbalance
them, I don't blindly,

1351
00:57:56,798 --> 00:58:00,276
I don't take my leadership's
opinions blindly,

1352
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:02,091
because they're protecting their lives

1353
00:58:02,091 --> 00:58:03,240
and their opportunity,

1354
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,993
and so they may be doing the wrong thing.

1355
00:58:04,993 --> 00:58:08,677
Subconsciously, they're not bad people.

1356
00:58:08,677 --> 00:58:10,871
So, it runs the gamut.

1357
00:58:10,871 --> 00:58:13,668
I mean, there was somebody
I hired not too long ago

1358
00:58:13,668 --> 00:58:15,341
that I thought was going to be important,

1359
00:58:15,341 --> 00:58:17,873
and I basically fired
that person in my mind

1360
00:58:17,873 --> 00:58:19,123
48 hours later.

1361
00:58:20,453 --> 00:58:24,148
So, the problem, the reason
most people here don't fire

1362
00:58:24,148 --> 00:58:26,325
when they're supposed to is their own ego.

1363
00:58:26,325 --> 00:58:28,000
They don't want to admit
that they were wrong

1364
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,891
in making the selection of the person.

1365
00:58:29,891 --> 00:58:32,495
And it is killing so
many of your businesses.

1366
00:58:32,495 --> 00:58:34,994
Or, the other reason that they don't fire

1367
00:58:34,994 --> 00:58:37,378
is somebody's too important
to their business financially,

1368
00:58:37,378 --> 00:58:39,572
even though they're a cancer internally,

1369
00:58:39,572 --> 00:58:42,437
which means they're going
to lose long term, too.

1370
00:58:42,437 --> 00:58:45,459
And so, I don't do those two things.

1371
00:58:45,459 --> 00:58:47,279
I make sure I'm way better than
everybody that works for me,

1372
00:58:47,279 --> 00:58:49,321
so I'm never at the mercy of anybody.

1373
00:58:49,321 --> 00:58:50,255
(audience laughter)

1374
00:58:50,255 --> 00:58:51,755
I'm being serious.

1375
00:58:52,843 --> 00:58:53,768
Uh-huh.

1376
00:58:53,768 --> 00:58:57,601
And I also am very humble
when it comes to my,

1377
00:59:00,666 --> 00:59:03,311
I think I have great EQ,
it's what I trade on,

1378
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:06,245
but I've been so wrong so many times,

1379
00:59:06,245 --> 00:59:08,489
because it's so difficult.

1380
00:59:08,489 --> 00:59:10,739
And so, they run the gamut.

1381
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:13,762
There's a million different things.

1382
00:59:13,762 --> 00:59:17,284
What's unacceptable, what speeds up,

1383
00:59:17,284 --> 00:59:20,255
people are fired much quicker for being

1384
00:59:20,255 --> 00:59:23,423
not nice to the other boys
and girls much quicker

1385
00:59:23,423 --> 00:59:26,093
than not being good at their job.

1386
00:59:26,093 --> 00:59:28,524
They can't be disruptive to the energy,

1387
00:59:28,524 --> 00:59:31,729
the culture, because I don't
like tension and negativity,

1388
00:59:31,729 --> 00:59:35,538
and if you're fucking me
up, you've got no shot.

1389
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:38,126
- [Audience Member] I like
that, thank you very much.

1390
00:59:38,126 --> 00:59:39,539
Could you sign two books?

1391
00:59:39,539 --> 00:59:40,985
- Yeah, of course.

1392
00:59:40,985 --> 00:59:44,402
- Okay, so, Rick, I'm throwing it to you.

1393
00:59:46,367 --> 00:59:47,528
- Nice throw.

1394
00:59:47,528 --> 00:59:49,266
- [Rick] Can you hear me?

1395
00:59:49,266 --> 00:59:50,436
- In a second I think we can.

1396
00:59:50,436 --> 00:59:51,381
- [Rick] Can you hear me?

1397
00:59:51,381 --> 00:59:52,214
- Yeah.

1398
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:53,061
- [Rick] Gary, welcome to Oslo.

1399
00:59:53,061 --> 00:59:54,519
- Thank you so much my friend.

1400
00:59:54,519 --> 00:59:55,785
- I've got two questions.

1401
00:59:55,785 --> 00:59:57,913
My first question,
first off I want to say,

1402
00:59:57,913 --> 01:00:00,363
thank you for talking
so much about gratitude.

1403
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:01,322
Thank you.

1404
01:00:01,322 --> 01:00:03,785
My first question, I'm going
to try to make you jealous.

1405
01:00:03,785 --> 01:00:05,549
- [Gary] Go ahead.

1406
01:00:05,549 --> 01:00:08,372
- I was a 13 year old boy.

1407
01:00:08,372 --> 01:00:11,234
I was growing up, I was living
in West Islip, New York.

1408
01:00:11,234 --> 01:00:12,067
- [Gary] Yes.

1409
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:15,201
- January 12th, 1969.
- 1969.

1410
01:00:15,201 --> 01:00:16,371
Best day on earth.

1411
01:00:16,371 --> 01:00:17,494
- I got up at six o'clock in the morning,

1412
01:00:17,494 --> 01:00:18,710
because I couldn't sleep.

1413
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:20,064
- [Gary] Awe man, I'm
super fucking jealous.

1414
01:00:20,064 --> 01:00:21,293
- Waited until four
o'clock in the afternoon,

1415
01:00:21,293 --> 01:00:22,126
what was I doing?

1416
01:00:22,126 --> 01:00:24,544
- You were ready for the
New York Jets stunning,

1417
01:00:24,544 --> 01:00:26,362
my friends, the Sports Illustrated,

1418
01:00:26,362 --> 01:00:28,504
the most important sports
magazine in America

1419
01:00:28,504 --> 01:00:30,911
at the time predicted the
Jets would lose the Superbowl,

1420
01:00:30,911 --> 01:00:32,078
41 to nothing.

1421
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:37,055
They were the biggest
underdog in Superbowl history,

1422
01:00:37,055 --> 01:00:38,285
and they won.

1423
01:00:38,285 --> 01:00:40,923
- [Rick] Broadway Joe Namath
against Johnny Unitas.

1424
01:00:40,923 --> 01:00:43,438
- That's amazing man, that's so cool.

1425
01:00:43,438 --> 01:00:45,184
I'm actually jealous.

1426
01:00:45,184 --> 01:00:48,425
- I brought you hat, that was the hat.

1427
01:00:48,425 --> 01:00:49,513
- [Gary] Do you have a question?

1428
01:00:49,513 --> 01:00:50,770
- The second question is about voice,

1429
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:52,497
because I'm really happy
you're talking about voice.

1430
01:00:52,497 --> 01:00:54,463
I just launched a voice app,

1431
01:00:54,463 --> 01:00:57,416
which is a voice analysis
technology, called Voiceable.

1432
01:00:57,416 --> 01:00:58,339
And what we do with the app,

1433
01:00:58,339 --> 01:00:59,908
is we record somebody's voice,

1434
01:00:59,908 --> 01:01:02,423
and then we help speakers and presenters

1435
01:01:02,423 --> 01:01:03,895
to work on their voice.

1436
01:01:03,895 --> 01:01:04,728
- [Gary] Interesting.

1437
01:01:04,728 --> 01:01:07,059
- It is interesting, and it
allows you to compare yourself

1438
01:01:07,059 --> 01:01:08,482
to some of the greatest speakers

1439
01:01:08,482 --> 01:01:10,405
and inspirational speakers in the world.

1440
01:01:10,405 --> 01:01:11,492
- So you're breaking down the analytics

1441
01:01:11,492 --> 01:01:12,325
of the sounds.

1442
01:01:12,325 --> 01:01:13,158
- [Rick] Exactly.

1443
01:01:13,158 --> 01:01:14,347
We're making it easy to practice with it.

1444
01:01:14,347 --> 01:01:15,180
- Interesting.

1445
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:16,889
- But the number one
celebrity that you can

1446
01:01:16,889 --> 01:01:19,615
compare yourself with
is always Barack Obama,

1447
01:01:19,615 --> 01:01:21,355
hard to beat, most people want to do it.

1448
01:01:21,355 --> 01:01:24,175
But number two, is GaryVee.

1449
01:01:24,175 --> 01:01:26,154
- I think you've got your ratings wrong.

1450
01:01:26,154 --> 01:01:27,828
(audience laughter)

1451
01:01:27,828 --> 01:01:29,882
- [Rick] I may have, I may have.

1452
01:01:29,882 --> 01:01:31,440
(audience applause)

1453
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,309
- That's amazing, I've got to see that.

1454
01:01:33,309 --> 01:01:35,187
- [Rick] So my question is,
there's all these entrepreneurs,

1455
01:01:35,187 --> 01:01:36,843
young entrepreneurs who are racing around

1456
01:01:36,843 --> 01:01:38,707
and they want to be like GaryVee.

1457
01:01:38,707 --> 01:01:40,615
And they're talking fast,
and they're trash talking.

1458
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:42,668
- And you know that scares me, right.

1459
01:01:42,668 --> 01:01:43,925
- [Rick] And my comment is,

1460
01:01:43,925 --> 01:01:45,463
what kind of comment
would you have to them?

1461
01:01:45,463 --> 01:01:46,366
Advice to them?

1462
01:01:46,366 --> 01:01:47,549
- I would say for them to be them.

1463
01:01:47,549 --> 01:01:51,323
You know, self-awareness,
along with gratitude,

1464
01:01:51,323 --> 01:01:52,831
and along with empathy,

1465
01:01:52,831 --> 01:01:54,743
is something I'm spending a
lot of time talking about.

1466
01:01:54,743 --> 01:01:57,718
It's funny, I come across so alpha,

1467
01:01:57,718 --> 01:02:00,805
so when I talk about all
these soft and warm skills,

1468
01:02:00,805 --> 01:02:03,255
I'm always fascinated by
how people consume it,

1469
01:02:03,255 --> 01:02:05,298
because it's a really curve ball, right.

1470
01:02:05,298 --> 01:02:07,296
What I would tell them
is they need to deploy

1471
01:02:07,296 --> 01:02:08,300
self-awareness.

1472
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:12,100
What made me me was I was brought up

1473
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,027
with so much self-esteem by a mother

1474
01:02:14,027 --> 01:02:16,847
that understood its power,
and I had my own DNA

1475
01:02:16,847 --> 01:02:20,306
and circumstances, that
I didn't want to be

1476
01:02:20,306 --> 01:02:21,679
anybody else.

1477
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:25,836
The level of knowledge I
have on Richard Branson,

1478
01:02:25,836 --> 01:02:29,291
Steve Jobs, or Jack Welsh,
or Bill Gates, or Mark.

1479
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:31,266
I know nothing about anybody.

1480
01:02:31,266 --> 01:02:32,737
Like, zero.

1481
01:02:32,737 --> 01:02:36,205
I've always just focused
on being confident

1482
01:02:36,205 --> 01:02:38,370
about what I had, and more importantly,

1483
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:40,350
being humble about what I didn't have.

1484
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:44,517
You can't, you know, when you
try to fabricate charisma,

1485
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:49,458
it comes out as the worst shtick ever.

1486
01:02:50,422 --> 01:02:52,225
And we can all taste it.

1487
01:02:52,225 --> 01:02:55,750
And so, look, I've double
down and tripled down

1488
01:02:55,750 --> 01:03:00,138
and quadrupled down and
continue to on what I have,

1489
01:03:00,138 --> 01:03:02,509
and so I try to tell a
lot of these young men,

1490
01:03:02,509 --> 01:03:04,385
you know it's been really
interesting for me.

1491
01:03:04,385 --> 01:03:07,862
I've been spending an ungodly
amount of time on motivation,

1492
01:03:07,862 --> 01:03:09,626
because I think it's a gateway drug

1493
01:03:09,626 --> 01:03:12,383
to get a lot of young men into my funnel.

1494
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,017
And I think a lot of young men

1495
01:03:14,017 --> 01:03:16,922
are very easily swayed
to the wrong things,

1496
01:03:16,922 --> 01:03:20,312
because of insecurities and
what kind of things guys want

1497
01:03:20,312 --> 01:03:22,991
in their 20's, and I've
been very proud about this

1498
01:03:22,991 --> 01:03:25,031
the last year from a legacy standpoint

1499
01:03:25,031 --> 01:03:27,519
of getting so many guys to think I'm cool,

1500
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:29,440
because then I systematically
break them down

1501
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,885
with my content.

1502
01:03:30,885 --> 01:03:33,437
Instead of being disrespectful and

1503
01:03:33,437 --> 01:03:36,147
instead of looking for money and girls

1504
01:03:36,147 --> 01:03:37,661
and things of that nature,

1505
01:03:37,661 --> 01:03:39,973
I start teaching them
tried and true things

1506
01:03:39,973 --> 01:03:43,295
that will make them get
everything they've ever wanted,

1507
01:03:43,295 --> 01:03:47,719
and be a much better
contributor to society.

1508
01:03:47,719 --> 01:03:49,293
- [Rick] Great, thank you
Gary, thank you very much.

1509
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:50,522
- You're welcome.

1510
01:03:50,522 --> 01:03:53,478
(audience applause)

1511
01:03:53,478 --> 01:03:55,296
And let's make sure we bring it up there,

1512
01:03:55,296 --> 01:03:58,494
because I always feel like we
always mess that up, right.

1513
01:03:58,494 --> 01:04:00,057
It always happens.

1514
01:04:00,057 --> 01:04:01,378
- [Audience Member] Hey Gary.

1515
01:04:01,378 --> 01:04:02,211
- How are you?

1516
01:04:02,211 --> 01:04:03,160
- [Audience Member] Fine, thank you.

1517
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,354
Very inspiring to be here.

1518
01:04:04,354 --> 01:04:05,421
- Thank you.

1519
01:04:05,421 --> 01:04:07,581
- I have a question, I do sales training

1520
01:04:07,581 --> 01:04:09,138
for business to business.

1521
01:04:09,138 --> 01:04:09,971
- [Gary] Awesome.

1522
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:11,302
- One of the biggest challenges for them

1523
01:04:11,302 --> 01:04:13,298
is to find the right customers

1524
01:04:13,298 --> 01:04:15,647
and actually get enough customer meetings

1525
01:04:15,647 --> 01:04:16,933
with the right clients.

1526
01:04:16,933 --> 01:04:17,766
- [Gary] Makes sense.

1527
01:04:17,766 --> 01:04:19,417
- I think that's all over the world,

1528
01:04:19,417 --> 01:04:20,525
about the same problem.

1529
01:04:20,525 --> 01:04:21,706
- Do you know why?

1530
01:04:21,706 --> 01:04:24,372
Because most people in B to B sales

1531
01:04:24,372 --> 01:04:27,910
are always talking instead of listening.

1532
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:30,735
The concept is spam everybody
on fucking LinkedIn,

1533
01:04:30,735 --> 01:04:32,231
pound them, pound them, pound them,

1534
01:04:32,231 --> 01:04:33,628
and nobody wants to talk to them anymore,

1535
01:04:33,628 --> 01:04:36,372
which is why they don't
have enough meetings.

1536
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:39,662
Instead of engaging in
content that's being put out

1537
01:04:39,662 --> 01:04:40,897
on Twitter and LinkedIn.

1538
01:04:40,897 --> 01:04:43,642
Where as if they say something
meaningful in a comment

1539
01:04:43,642 --> 01:04:46,660
in LinkedIn, they get
asked to have a meeting,

1540
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:49,643
versus the other way around.

1541
01:04:49,643 --> 01:04:52,021
- [Audience Member] And over
here you talked about Facebook

1542
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:54,044
being under priced, and
you talked about this

1543
01:04:54,044 --> 01:04:55,908
white paper on LinkedIn.

1544
01:04:55,908 --> 01:04:58,502
What is kind of under
priced or right value

1545
01:04:58,502 --> 01:05:02,301
meaning to get in contact
with the right clients

1546
01:05:02,301 --> 01:05:03,881
for business to business companies.

1547
01:05:03,881 --> 01:05:05,277
- The reason I love B to B is you know

1548
01:05:05,277 --> 01:05:07,018
who you're trying to reach.

1549
01:05:07,018 --> 01:05:08,332
And so when I said listening,

1550
01:05:08,332 --> 01:05:09,849
I gave you the tactical way, which is

1551
01:05:09,849 --> 01:05:11,142
people are putting out content,

1552
01:05:11,142 --> 01:05:13,349
and you can engage with that
content, and they'll see you.

1553
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:14,927
The much better way to listen

1554
01:05:14,927 --> 01:05:17,520
is to know the company you're going after,

1555
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,154
doing some research for an
hour or two or three days,

1556
01:05:21,154 --> 01:05:24,726
and understanding what their
strengths and weaknesses are,

1557
01:05:24,726 --> 01:05:26,804
and then things that people blow me away.

1558
01:05:26,804 --> 01:05:28,758
For example, in my business.

1559
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,409
There's a lot of people I
want to do business with,

1560
01:05:30,409 --> 01:05:33,994
but if the CEO is best
friends with Martin Sorrell,

1561
01:05:33,994 --> 01:05:36,253
we're not getting that business.

1562
01:05:36,253 --> 01:05:38,636
And so, I'm stunned by
sales people's inability

1563
01:05:38,636 --> 01:05:40,797
to deal in reality.

1564
01:05:40,797 --> 01:05:42,094
I love when sales people are like,

1565
01:05:42,094 --> 01:05:43,103
I'm going to break through.

1566
01:05:43,103 --> 01:05:44,399
No you aren't, asshole.

1567
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:45,980
You're going to waste time.

1568
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:50,430
And so I think listening,
research, understanding,

1569
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:52,792
instead of blanket spray
and pray, high volume,

1570
01:05:52,792 --> 01:05:56,922
cold calls, emails, networking
events, handing cards,

1571
01:05:56,922 --> 01:05:59,422
it's just, it's not working.

1572
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:00,757
It's a waste of time and money.

1573
01:06:00,757 --> 01:06:02,837
Sometimes the math works
out, I'm not against it,

1574
01:06:02,837 --> 01:06:04,373
I love the hustle.

1575
01:06:04,373 --> 01:06:06,991
But a lot more listening
and understanding the score,

1576
01:06:06,991 --> 01:06:08,933
understanding who you're competing with.

1577
01:06:08,933 --> 01:06:12,031
And understanding if that
product, there's happiness,

1578
01:06:12,031 --> 01:06:13,243
in the system.

1579
01:06:13,243 --> 01:06:15,148
The reason Vayner's grown so quickly

1580
01:06:15,148 --> 01:06:17,742
is I paid attention to who was not happy

1581
01:06:17,742 --> 01:06:19,806
with their digital work.

1582
01:06:19,806 --> 01:06:21,433
I didn't go after brands,
there's a lot of brands

1583
01:06:21,433 --> 01:06:22,647
I wish I was working with.

1584
01:06:22,647 --> 01:06:24,298
Cereal is my favorite product,

1585
01:06:24,298 --> 01:06:25,588
and we don't have a cereal client.

1586
01:06:25,588 --> 01:06:26,988
I can't fine the right angle right now

1587
01:06:26,988 --> 01:06:30,679
to seeing any of the big
cereal brands upset enough

1588
01:06:30,679 --> 01:06:33,035
that it's a good conversation.

1589
01:06:33,035 --> 01:06:33,868
Got it?

1590
01:06:33,868 --> 01:06:34,701
- [Audience Member] Yeah.

1591
01:06:34,701 --> 01:06:37,073
- So, a lot more, the best
way to be a great sales person

1592
01:06:37,073 --> 01:06:40,420
is to be a listener, not a talker.

1593
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:41,283
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

1594
01:06:41,283 --> 01:06:42,445
- You're welcome.

1595
01:06:42,445 --> 01:06:44,409
(audience applause)

1596
01:06:44,409 --> 01:06:47,076
- Okay, all the way in the back.

1597
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:50,091
- [Audience Member] Cereal killer.

1598
01:06:50,091 --> 01:06:51,424
- Cereal killer.

1599
01:07:00,721 --> 01:07:03,812
- Hey, my name's Kurt
and I'm the president

1600
01:07:03,812 --> 01:07:06,477
of one of the university's here in Oslo.

1601
01:07:06,477 --> 01:07:07,450
- Very nice.

1602
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:10,256
- And university education
is a dying industry.

1603
01:07:10,256 --> 01:07:12,765
We're slaves to the campus model,

1604
01:07:12,765 --> 01:07:14,814
our government cares only about

1605
01:07:14,814 --> 01:07:18,016
getting people through fast enough.

1606
01:07:18,016 --> 01:07:21,121
I assume you think
education is a good idea,

1607
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:24,376
but do you see any value for degrees.

1608
01:07:24,376 --> 01:07:27,313
- I do see value for degrees
for the short and medium term

1609
01:07:27,313 --> 01:07:29,559
if people have a very
specific job they want

1610
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:32,516
and that organization requires a degree.

1611
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:36,081
If you want to be a consultant
at Bain and McKinsey

1612
01:07:36,081 --> 01:07:38,321
in the next 24 to 36 months,

1613
01:07:38,321 --> 01:07:39,864
I still believe that they care about

1614
01:07:39,864 --> 01:07:41,200
where you went to college.

1615
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,850
However, and you can hold onto the mic,

1616
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:46,285
because I think we might have
a good conversation here.

1617
01:07:46,285 --> 01:07:48,265
However, to you're question
that you're leading,

1618
01:07:48,265 --> 01:07:49,984
I think you're barking up the right tree.

1619
01:07:49,984 --> 01:07:51,394
I don't think that people realize

1620
01:07:51,394 --> 01:07:53,253
that the biggest and best
universities in the world

1621
01:07:53,253 --> 01:07:56,054
are only trading on brand, right.

1622
01:07:56,054 --> 01:07:57,557
Not on the actual education.

1623
01:07:57,557 --> 01:07:59,765
That that actual education
is actually sitting

1624
01:07:59,765 --> 01:08:00,922
at the professor level,

1625
01:08:00,922 --> 01:08:03,011
not at the university or campus level.

1626
01:08:03,011 --> 01:08:05,422
And as education gets commoditized,

1627
01:08:05,422 --> 01:08:07,259
you know, distribution of
education gets commoditized,

1628
01:08:07,259 --> 01:08:08,651
and things like Khan Academy

1629
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:11,158
and the seven other things
that are about to happen,

1630
01:08:11,158 --> 01:08:14,982
if you get the 13 best
professors of economics together.

1631
01:08:14,982 --> 01:08:18,501
If I, if I as a great
business man went out

1632
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:22,942
and rounded up the 13 best
professors around economics

1633
01:08:22,942 --> 01:08:25,604
and created a direct to consumer economics

1634
01:08:25,604 --> 01:08:30,000
training education
platform, we would dominate.

1635
01:08:30,001 --> 01:08:31,504
We would dominate, we would win.

1636
01:08:31,504 --> 01:08:33,019
Because that's where the IP is.

1637
01:08:33,019 --> 01:08:36,055
It's in her and him,
not at the local level.

1638
01:08:36,055 --> 01:08:39,862
And so, I think over
the next 20 to 30 years,

1639
01:08:39,863 --> 01:08:43,934
this great run of 100
years plus, is coming to.

1640
01:08:43,934 --> 01:08:45,125
- [Audience Member] 1,000 years.

1641
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:46,161
- Respect, respect.

1642
01:08:46,161 --> 01:08:47,403
Because I'm undereducated.

1643
01:08:47,403 --> 01:08:50,011
This great run, it's true, I am.

1644
01:08:50,011 --> 01:08:54,046
To your point, is clearly
in a vulnerable place.

1645
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:56,162
And I think every country
has it's own dynamics.

1646
01:08:56,162 --> 01:08:58,894
My answer was, you know, in America,

1647
01:08:58,895 --> 01:09:00,362
you started getting into the 50's

1648
01:09:00,362 --> 01:09:02,398
when everybody had to go to college,

1649
01:09:02,398 --> 01:09:05,618
or a community college,
not go vocational, right.

1650
01:09:05,618 --> 01:09:07,843
So there's different
dynamics, different cultures

1651
01:09:07,844 --> 01:09:11,495
will spend their time
differently in dissolving this.

1652
01:09:11,495 --> 01:09:13,818
But I think your energy is right,

1653
01:09:13,818 --> 01:09:15,990
I think when somebody watches
this video in 50 years

1654
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:18,013
they're going to say,
wow those guys got it.

1655
01:09:18,013 --> 01:09:18,880
- Those guys got it.

1656
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,263
Yeah, you know, because
all we really need to do

1657
01:09:21,263 --> 01:09:23,876
at the institutional level is, in a sense,

1658
01:09:23,876 --> 01:09:25,662
double check and give accreditation

1659
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:28,297
to all the crazy online work experience,

1660
01:09:28,298 --> 01:09:30,568
combination of things
that people put together

1661
01:09:30,568 --> 01:09:31,703
to make an education.

1662
01:09:31,703 --> 01:09:33,103
- And don't forget, and don't forget,

1663
01:09:33,104 --> 01:09:35,055
that's just playing on the brand, right.

1664
01:09:35,055 --> 01:09:36,948
Putting that seal of
approval is just brand.

1665
01:09:36,948 --> 01:09:38,772
- [Audience Member] And
ensuring the quality.

1666
01:09:38,773 --> 01:09:40,703
But the idea that we're
going to draw everybody

1667
01:09:40,703 --> 01:09:42,343
to move onto campus for
five years to get education,

1668
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:43,497
that's crazy.

1669
01:09:43,497 --> 01:09:44,663
- And listen, listen.

1670
01:09:44,663 --> 01:09:45,837
The counter argument people will say,

1671
01:09:45,837 --> 01:09:47,437
well people have grown
up on these campuses.

1672
01:09:47,438 --> 01:09:49,113
I listen to that, I agree, but listen.

1673
01:09:49,113 --> 01:09:50,310
Travel around the world then.

1674
01:09:50,310 --> 01:09:52,587
You know, like there's
so many alternatives

1675
01:09:52,587 --> 01:09:54,963
to putting them on campus
where they can learn

1676
01:09:54,963 --> 01:09:57,629
to mature as individuals.

1677
01:09:57,629 --> 01:10:02,122
I mean, you're preaching
to the choir on this one.

1678
01:10:02,122 --> 01:10:03,872
I think it plays out,

1679
01:10:04,957 --> 01:10:07,344
but of course learning is imperative.

1680
01:10:07,344 --> 01:10:09,556
But like, you know for me, you know,

1681
01:10:09,556 --> 01:10:10,954
entrepreneurship's probably the one

1682
01:10:10,954 --> 01:10:12,409
that's most intriguing to me,

1683
01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:14,203
because the thought of
learning entrepreneurship

1684
01:10:14,203 --> 01:10:16,725
in a classroom versus being in the field,

1685
01:10:16,725 --> 01:10:18,831
is just so ludicrous.

1686
01:10:18,831 --> 01:10:21,617
And then America has
a weird extra dynamic.

1687
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:25,148
The level of debt our
citizens are going into.

1688
01:10:25,148 --> 01:10:27,337
You've got 23 year olds
coming out of college today

1689
01:10:27,337 --> 01:10:32,271
with $280,000 in debt at
enormously high interest rates,

1690
01:10:32,271 --> 01:10:34,060
and the piece of paper's not getting them

1691
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:36,405
a good job anymore.

1692
01:10:36,405 --> 01:10:38,190
I mean, it's really bad in America.

1693
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:39,023
Really bad.

1694
01:10:39,023 --> 01:10:40,412
And ironically, it's the one thing

1695
01:10:40,412 --> 01:10:43,288
you can't declare bankruptcy
from and clear up.

1696
01:10:43,288 --> 01:10:47,574
You can literally be fraudulent
and clean up your credit,

1697
01:10:47,574 --> 01:10:50,831
but you can't do it with a college debt.

1698
01:10:50,831 --> 01:10:55,180
I mean, it's such a fucking
fraud it makes me throw up.

1699
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,656
- [Audience Member] Yeah, that's right.

1700
01:10:56,656 --> 01:10:57,916
Me too.

1701
01:10:57,916 --> 01:10:59,884
(audience applause)

1702
01:10:59,884 --> 01:11:03,204
- Unfortunately Gary, we're
out of time for questions.

1703
01:11:03,204 --> 01:11:04,114
- Really?

1704
01:11:04,114 --> 01:11:07,603
- Yeah, and the organizers
are really strict about time.

1705
01:11:07,603 --> 01:11:09,398
- But can we sneak maybe one more in?

1706
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:10,889
- Yeah, let's be rebels, let's do that.

1707
01:11:10,889 --> 01:11:11,722
Fuck that.

1708
01:11:11,722 --> 01:11:12,780
- Fight the system.

1709
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:14,113
- Last question.

1710
01:11:17,007 --> 01:11:20,733
- Okay clearly that guy.
- Okay this guy, obviously.

1711
01:11:20,733 --> 01:11:22,118
- [Gary] That was good marketing.

1712
01:11:22,118 --> 01:11:23,064
- [Interviewer] Yeah, strong feelings.

1713
01:11:23,064 --> 01:11:25,096
- [Gary] I'm telling you,
sound is a voice baby.

1714
01:11:25,096 --> 01:11:28,191
- [Audience Member] Thank you so much.

1715
01:11:28,191 --> 01:11:31,493
Okay, hi GaryVee, I'm Jan Frederik B.

1716
01:11:31,493 --> 01:11:33,819
It's an honor to talk to you.

1717
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:36,141
You were talking about Google,

1718
01:11:36,141 --> 01:11:39,090
and the possibility to do
a deal as good as a steal,

1719
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:40,470
then it was Facebook.

1720
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:42,375
Which emerging platforms do you see

1721
01:11:42,375 --> 01:11:46,470
with the biggest potential
for steal deal right now.

1722
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:49,132
- Alexa skills and briefings.

1723
01:11:49,132 --> 01:11:50,084
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

1724
01:11:50,084 --> 01:11:51,055
- You're welcome.

1725
01:11:51,055 --> 01:11:53,183
And let me give you
guys why that plays out.

1726
01:11:53,183 --> 01:11:55,433
I believe that if you're quick to building

1727
01:11:55,433 --> 01:11:57,844
briefings and skills, and if
you don't know the difference

1728
01:11:57,844 --> 01:11:59,622
between an Alexa skill
and an Alexa briefing,

1729
01:11:59,622 --> 01:12:01,350
you literally just Google it,

1730
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,740
and in about 15 minutes
you'll know, got it.

1731
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,359
But one is just passive information,

1732
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:07,715
one is more AI and understands and can go

1733
01:12:07,715 --> 01:12:08,869
back and forth with you.

1734
01:12:08,869 --> 01:12:11,556
I, look, in the same way to your point,

1735
01:12:11,556 --> 01:12:12,897
Snapchat's bigger here than Instagram,

1736
01:12:12,897 --> 01:12:13,995
and things of that nature.

1737
01:12:13,995 --> 01:12:16,010
I always want to give
advice that matters to you.

1738
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:19,306
I don't know how the voice
play plays out in the Nordics,

1739
01:12:19,306 --> 01:12:21,182
but here's what I can tell you.

1740
01:12:21,182 --> 01:12:23,306
It's going to happen, and
the quicker you understand

1741
01:12:23,306 --> 01:12:26,588
the theoretical strategies behind it,

1742
01:12:26,588 --> 01:12:29,863
when your thing happens,
you'll be able to move quicker

1743
01:12:29,863 --> 01:12:32,077
instead of debating if
it's going to happen.

1744
01:12:32,077 --> 01:12:34,246
And that's why I think that's the most.

1745
01:12:34,246 --> 01:12:36,655
And I don't usually guess, or I don't,

1746
01:12:36,655 --> 01:12:39,179
by day trading attention, you
don't know what's coming next,

1747
01:12:39,179 --> 01:12:41,440
you don't care, you only care about today.

1748
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,550
But to give you an
insight, I do believe that

1749
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:46,262
is the clear black and
white emerging space

1750
01:12:46,262 --> 01:12:48,128
in our society.

1751
01:12:48,128 --> 01:12:49,085
- Nice.

1752
01:12:49,085 --> 01:12:50,390
- [Audience Member] Amazing, thank you.

1753
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:51,223
- You're welcome.

1754
01:12:51,223 --> 01:12:53,016
- Okay, so I'm just going to give you some

1755
01:12:53,016 --> 01:12:54,079
practical information in Norwegian,

1756
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:54,937
so bear with us.

1757
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:55,770
- Respect.

1758
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:56,676
- And then we're going to thank you

1759
01:12:56,676 --> 01:12:57,891
and we're going to give
you a nice applause.

1760
01:12:57,891 --> 01:12:58,724
- Great.

1761
01:12:59,866 --> 01:13:01,533
I'll check my phone.

1762
01:13:02,928 --> 01:13:06,845
(speaking in foreign language)

1763
01:14:12,451 --> 01:14:15,616
- We're going to watch a
movie, so, two seconds.

1764
01:14:15,616 --> 01:14:17,616
- That's what I thought.

1765
01:14:18,963 --> 01:14:21,546
(upbeat music)

1766
01:15:31,054 --> 01:15:33,776
(audience applause)

1767
01:15:33,776 --> 01:15:36,109
- Okay everybody, thank you.

1768
01:15:37,842 --> 01:15:39,515
Thank you so much for coming,

1769
01:15:39,515 --> 01:15:42,030
and let's give Gary a big applause.

1770
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:43,564
(audience applause)

1771
01:15:43,564 --> 01:15:46,270
- Thank you, thank you.

1772
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:50,344
- [Interviewer] And have
a great day, thank you!

1773
01:15:50,344 --> 01:15:53,344
(audience applause)

1774
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,070
- Leave your four cents,
