00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:05,339
were going to submit<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question via</font>

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,919
Instagram I said no because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,840
a smartphone so I can't get an account

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,450
so I borrowed my daughter's phone to

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,969
open an account<font color="#E5E5E5"> and upload the stupid</font>

7
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,779
question my<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is are you happy</font>

8
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,990

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,460
and interacting on Twitter for a very

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,260
long time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that you care</font>

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,960
enough about me and this show to jump

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,720
into new waters is in essence the entire

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,059
thesis of what I do for a living would

14
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,500
just try to get people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop drawing</font>

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,270
lines in the sand and not be religious

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,430
and jump in and do new things and taste

17
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,219
them and then decide if they're stupid I

18
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,120
am happy but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a hell of a</font>

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,950
lot happier in nine and a half months

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,719
when I go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your account that you</font>
