1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:01,125
- 60 second club.

2
00:00:01,125 --> 00:00:03,417
- [Jewell] 60 second club.

3
00:00:03,417 --> 00:00:04,333
- Making dreams happen.

4
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:05,834
- [Jewell] It is blowing up.

5
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:06,792
It is amazing.

6
00:00:06,792 --> 00:00:08,542
- You know, it's
getting back on the upswing.

7
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:09,708
I took it away for a little bit,

8
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:10,959
for five minutes,
because I wanted depth,

9
00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:13,583
but I realized
the depth of comments

10
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:16,708
didn't offset the
excitement of that quick minute

11
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:19,125
and just the action,
so, I brought it back

12
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,417
and I'm getting
real serious about it.

13
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:23,166
- [Jewell] When you did
that I was actually amazed.

14
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,333
I'm like, this guy
knows how to direct attention.

15
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,500
I was like, it's crazy.

16
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,000
- It's day training attention.

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,041
- [Jewell] That's crazy stuff.

18
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,917
- Cool, what
can I help you with?

19
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:33,208
- [Jewell] So, gosh, a lot
of different things.

20
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:36,083
So, basically
right now I am in Dallas,

21
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,583
I'm in the mortgage industry.

22
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,250
Like I said, I
was a loan officer,

23
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,125
so it really plays
on my natural abilities.

24
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,083
- Yep.

25
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,708
- [Jewell] I'm 26,
I've moved 21 times.

26
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:45,750
- Really?

27
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,250
- [Jewell] Yeah, from
California originally,

28
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,250
lived everywhere in California,

29
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,583
lived all over the place,
Atlanta, Dallas now.

30
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,792
- Family dynamics
or military or?

31
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:56,291
- [Jewell] I come
from a military family,

32
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,458
but that's not why. (laughs)

33
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,750
My mom was in real estate
and stuff when I was younger,

34
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,041
and so, we just moved
with that, and then it--

35
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,291
- Flipping, building?

36
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,667
- [Jewell] Yeah, it
just became habitual.

37
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:06,417
So, I really got sucked into it,

38
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:07,917
just that change of pace.

39
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:10,375
So, there's a lot of
positives that come outta that.

40
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:12,333
- Yeah, I mean, sure.

41
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,291
- So, I've never met a stranger.

42
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,291
I can go anywhere
and you can drop me in,

43
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,917
and I'll fit in pretty quickly.

44
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:20,333
But at the same time,
I haven't really developed

45
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,583
those long term
relationships or anything.

46
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,041
- Yeah, of course,
flag in the ground.

47
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,667
- [Jewell] Exactly.
So, I love trying new things,

48
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:28,917
and I will give my
attention to it 100%

49
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:30,208
like right in the moment.

50
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,083
And I will kind of dissect it,

51
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,333
how I will put my
brain power into it,

52
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:35,834
and then I kind of
move on to the next thing.

53
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:37,667
Because it's like,
okay, something new,

54
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:40,500
squirrel, almost in a sense.

55
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,542
- I think I'm like that

56
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:44,583
but what I think
has made me successful

57
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,667
is I've always
had one big pillar.

58
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:48,875
It's kind of
like eating a burger

59
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,208
but always having
different complements to it.

60
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,875
I think a lot of people just eat

61
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:56,125
the potato or the pickle,
or the onion,

62
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,000
or the mayonnaise, or
the mayonnaise and mayo,

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,208
or the ketchup, or the jalapeno,

64
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,625
but they never eat the burger.

65
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:02,291
- [Jewell] Right.

66
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:05,708
- Like, I have the
burger, Wine Library,

67
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,875
VaynerMedia,
my personal brand, investing.

68
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:11,333
Those are my burgers
but I do a million things.

69
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,625
Do you how many
people think this,

70
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,250
I mean, he's
covering me for this,

71
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,458
this is insane.

72
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,458
I have no time.

73
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:17,041
- [Jewell] Yeah, exactly.

74
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,250
- For me to be
spending 49 minutes on this

75
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,375
is so fucking crazy, 
it makes zero sense.

76
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:27,208
But it sits in the
GaryVee brand pillar.

77
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,000
I believe in it.

78
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,667
But it is me being ADD'd out.

79
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:33,667
- [Jewell] Yeah.

80
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:35,000
- And what I think
you need to figure out

81
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,750
is you gotta create
at least one burger.

82
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,041
I've got four, right?

83
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,959
You need to have one.
- [Jewell] Right.

84
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,542
- If you feel you
don't, I don't know yet,

85
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:42,625
but that's the analogy.

86
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:43,583
- [Jewell] Yeah, so I would say

87
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,583
I don't necessarily
have a burger.

88
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,250
- Right. Because what the
burger does is it allows you

89
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,500
to create the wealth creation
or the financial stability

90
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,959
that allows you to go flirt.

91
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,208
- [Jewell] Yeah, this is true.

92
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,375
Yeah, it gives you freedom 
to have that flexibility.

93
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,834
One thing I'm
trying to do on the side,

94
00:02:57,834 --> 00:02:59,708
so, I'm learning this whole
business development thing

95
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:00,583
and trying to play on that

96
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,750
just because of the
relationship aspect.

97
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,542
- Before we go there,
let's work backwards.

98
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:06,417
At this moment of your life,

99
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:08,041
what are the major KPIs?

100
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,458
Like, you know,
if you go real long term,

101
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,917
of course, right now
there's gonna be a lot of things

102
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:15,875
like that money stream and
different things of that nature.

103
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:19,625
But like, if you can anticipate
good things playing out

104
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,792
or not good things,
how do you see it?

105
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:25,458
How big is your ambition?

106
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,708
And not like peacocking,
like, you're still a young man

107
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,959
but you're not 14, either.

108
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,708
What's your intuition say?

109
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,542
Because this is
a big part of it.

110
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:35,625
- [Jewell] Yeah, absolutely.

111
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,667
So, I think, I mean,
money's important.

112
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:39,333
- Of course.

113
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,417
- [Jewell] But it's not a
driving factor in any capacity.

114
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:42,708
So, one thing that I love to do,

115
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,834
and I know you hear
this day in and day out,

116
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:46,000
but I love to give back.

117
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,750
So, I'm 26, by about no
means, no shit. (laughs)

118
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,959
Like I'm still
definitely learning.

119
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,333
But there's a
lot of opportunities

120
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,125
that I've been afforded that
a lot of people can't have.

121
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,500
And so, my big thing
that I kind of operate

122
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,000
from my personal space is

123
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,458
every conversation
that I have with somebody

124
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,458
if I can give them
something that, you know,

125
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,166
basically in the
same way that you do.

126
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,917
You give
somebody practical stuff,

127
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:06,583
I just try and share that.

128
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,667
- Is that because
you love being a leader

129
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,166
and deploying your charisma?

130
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,333
- [Jewell] So, I'm
the oldest of four boys.

131
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,291
- Makes sense.

132
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,625
- [Jewell] And then
also just being that mover.

133
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,542
- Yeah, I get it.

134
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:16,458
- [Jewell] I have to kind of--

135
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,500
- So, you get a high
from that leadership role.

136
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,166
- [Jewell]
Absolutely, absolutely.

137
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,000
- I get it.

138
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,667
- [Jewell] And so,
what that means in terms of

139
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:26,125
a business space or a
professional space or career,

140
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,875
I mean, you can kind of dig
that anywhere that you want.

141
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,834
So, one thing that I'm
doing on the side right now

142
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:32,250
I'm just gonna see
how it kind of flourishes,

143
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,625
I'm actually gonna start a blog.

144
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,375
- You should definitely do that.

145
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,041
That was the next
place that I was gonna go,

146
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:41,333
which is do you feel like
you wanna be a personality?

147
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,041
- [Jewell] I mean,
yeah, I can be.

148
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,917
- And I know you know
enough about my thing,

149
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:46,750
and I'm not going down the

150
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,959
who the fuck do
you think you are,

151
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,959
don't be that
26-year-old life coach.

152
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,708
But I do think we've
never lived in a time

153
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,375
where people can
be personal brands,

154
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,625
I mean, it's
really funny, right.

155
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,166
I wrote a book almost a
decade ago called "Crush It!",

156
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,083
which is go build
your personal brand.

157
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:00,959
And then I've
spent the last 10 years

158
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,500
making fun of people who--

159
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,417
- [Jewell] Who do it.

160
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:04,834
- Because so many
people try to fake it.

161
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:06,166
- [Jewell] Yeah. No, absolutely.

162
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:09,125
- And that's how I got
to document over creating.

163
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,375
- [Jewell] Man,
I can't tell you.

164
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,667
I mean, obviously,
that's gone viral

165
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:13,917
but that's so huge,
just that concept.

166
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:16,000
- Because then you don't have
to fake it till you make it.

167
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,333
- [Jewell] Exactly.

168
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,250
- To me, you're
not any different,

169
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,291
outside of a couple
tweaks here and there,

170
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:26,458
like me 26 years old
was gonna be me, this.

171
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:29,333
I wish I was
documenting that shit.

172
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,917
I wish I was going
through my first bit.

173
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:36,583
- [Jewell] The ability to do it,
I mean, that requires video--

174
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:40,458
- So devastated that
shit's lost in history.

175
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,583
Again, just vibing
off your natural charisma

176
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,166
and the whole thing,
that's the game.

177
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:46,750
- [Jewell] Yeah.

178
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,041
- You need to figure that out.

179
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,333
- [Jewell] Yeah, absolutely.

180
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,750
And so my thought
process behind the blog

181
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,750
is, obviously, I
wanna give value to people.

182
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,875
- And you're
gonna do a blog written?

183
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:56,917
- [Jewell] It will be written.

184
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:58,125
- 'Cause you can write?

185
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,750
I can write but I
also have a lot of videos,

186
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,500
obviously, a big piece,
I think that's easy.

187
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Podcasts add an element to that,

188
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,417
kind of like an
interview type thing.

189
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:07,542
I think there's a
lot of different factors.

190
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:09,208
- So, let me give
you something to debate.

191
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:14,166
I think nobody has taken my
words and gone real practical.

192
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,625
Like, I think
somebody should brand,

193
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:21,417
I think you should call
it like The Journey to 42.

194
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:26,000
Somebody needs to put some
context around what I'm doing.

195
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,166
26, right?
- [Jewell] Yep.

196
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:32,375
- The 20-Year Itch, like
I think you should write,

197
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,750
everything you should talk about

198
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,333
is to getting to 46 years old.

199
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:40,083
Like nobody's
synthesized down my thesis

200
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,041
and made it about that.
- [Jewell] Right.

201
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,417
Like, you know?

202
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,125
- [Jewell] Absolutely.

203
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,959
I think with your
document versus create,

204
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,333
so I, habitually I'm a little,

205
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,667
I have that kind of ADD

206
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:54,417
in terms of change and things,
but I'm also a perfectionist.

207
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:56,750
So, I love things
to be really sweet.

208
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,792
And so, before I heard
the document versus create

209
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,542
I was very much involved in the

210
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:02,625
this has to be perfect,
I wanna do it right.

211
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,792
- Document versus
create was built

212
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:07,834
out of my internal
hate for perfection.

213
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:08,667
- [Jewell] Yep.

214
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:10,291
And I realize that it
doesn't get me anywhere

215
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,542
when I try and be perfect.

216
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:13,875
- It doesn't exist,
it's a subjective call.

217
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,000
What the fuck is perfect?
- [Jewell] Exactly.

218
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,458
So, once I heard that

219
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:20,333
I got much more into my
SnapChat, and my Instagram,

220
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,250
my Facebook and documenting,
and now I'm much more--

221
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,250
- Well, go figure.

222
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,083
- [Jewell] I know,
it's ironic how it works.

223
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,250
- Go Figure.

224
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,083
- [Jewell] So, it's pushed me
into more of a creative space

225
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,667
where now I'm not so much--

226
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,625
- What I don't
think people realize is

227
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:36,041
by documenting and
communicating on a daily basis,

228
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:39,000
as you build an
audience that is just interested

229
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,667
in people, reality TV at scale,

230
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,792
it opens up business
development opportunities.

231
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:45,750
You never know when
you're gonna write something

232
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,583
or say something in a
video six years from now

233
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,875
that unlocks the
leader that wants to see you.

234
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:55,959
I had one of the great
stars of the last 20 years

235
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,625
team in here a couple hours ago,

236
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,417
they came to me off the
document thing and creating.

237
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:05,583
I think, again, as you
know, you've seen this.

238
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,417
- [Jewell] Yeah, absolutely

239
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:07,667
- I've had these
specific meetings.

240
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:10,125
Everybody gives
slightly different advice.

241
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,500
I do think,
I think people don't know

242
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,917
if I'm just being nice.

243
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:17,375
Like remembering you
from the DC event is easy

244
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,959
because you have a
little bit of a presence.

245
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,250
- [Jewell] Thank you.

246
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,208
- I think you need
to figure that out.

247
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,834
And what I mean by that is

248
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:26,208
I actually think you
have a very basic blueprint.

249
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,083
I think you need to
communicate on a daily basis.

250
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,041
Don't bullshit.

251
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:29,875
- [Jewell] Yeah.

252
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:34,291
- But I do think a child
of 21 locations in 26 years,

253
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,667
a oldest of four boys,

254
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:37,917
I think opening up,

255
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,457
and you haven't
opened up yet to me

256
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:41,875
on what that 21, you know,

257
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,750
that 21 locations has
some dirt in there, too.

258
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,750
- [Jewell] It absolutely does.

259
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,583
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Of course.

260
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,208
I think you need
to find your cadence.

261
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,834
I didn't open up about things.

262
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:52,417
I didn't talk
about my struggles until,

263
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:55,041
it took me time.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

264
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:58,834
- I think, so,
I buy into a 26 year old

265
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,875
that's never built
a $10 million business

266
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,625
from a "leadership" standpoint,

267
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,667
'cause I buy into
being the oldest of four,

268
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,375
especially if you can
give me a story or two.

269
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,917
- [Jewell] Right. Yeah.
- You know?

270
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:11,583
So, I think you should
definitely go hardcore at that.

271
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,500
I'll say another thing,
and this is as much for you

272
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,917
as everybody who's
watching 'cause I think

273
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:16,959
this is a new thought I have.

274
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,667
I think there's
a lot of DRocks.

275
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:19,708
I think a lot of
people see DRock,

276
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,750
and they know I pay
him, and they're like,

277
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,625
"Well, shit, I can't do
that, I have to do this."

278
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,000
I actually don't
think that's true.

279
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,041
I actually think there
are thousands of people

280
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,333
that are watching
this right now,

281
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,542
and even if you didn't
have the serendipity and luck

282
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:33,333
of being here, and now
it'll naturally come to you

283
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,750
in the comments of
DailyVee, you're gonna get this,

284
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,458
I think there's just, if I
were you, and more importantly

285
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,959
the 10,000 people 
watching right now,

286
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,417
for this advice,
they should go to YouTube,

287
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,208
they should spend a
month, find 59, 159,

288
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,834
437 people making video content,

289
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:50,667
who have very few subscriptions,

290
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,208
DRock could have been had.

291
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,417
Somebody could have
emailed him and said,

292
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:55,500
"I believe in your talent, 
come and be my partner.

293
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,041
"Come and document me,
I'm going to be like that.

294
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,083
"Believe in me."

295
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,417
I think you can
sell people on that.

296
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:00,917
- [Jewell] Yeah.

297
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:03,792
I would believe you,
let alone 500 people

298
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:06,291
who just want to be artists
and who just want to do it,

299
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,250
and who want to be
nomads too, so that's

300
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,583
another thing to
think about, man.

301
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:14,208
- [Jewell] Okay, and so I think,
on that note specifically,

302
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,917
given the fact that with
cell phones and all that,

303
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:17,792
we have the ability
to do it all ourselves,

304
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:19,667
I don't know if necessarily
that's something like,

305
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:21,458
me going and finding out--
- That's up to you.

306
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,500
- [Jewell] Now, that could
be beneficial in the future.

307
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,166
And it could be
teaming up or something,

308
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,250
it's not
necessarily hiring them,

309
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,667
it's somebody that
just wants to jump in.

310
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:29,917
- It's number two.

311
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:31,875
If you can't afford it, 
I just generally,

312
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:35,166
you have to understand: 
it's a supply and demand game.

313
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:35,708
- [Jewell] Right.

314
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,750
When people get mad
about "working for free,"

315
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,125
they don't understand
it's all supply and demand.

316
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:44,375
No hardcore
amazing computer developer

317
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,291
works for free anymore
because there's demand.

318
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:46,959
- [Jewell] Right.

319
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,625
When there are
unlimited kids filming,

320
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,959
and listen, if
you're Steven Spielberg, go!

321
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,458
But before you're that,
where do you think,

322
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,500
you know it's so funny, 
"working for free."

323
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,333
Working for free on your terms,

324
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,583
versus getting paid
dick to pay your dues

325
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,250
on not terms,
it's not even close!

326
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,375
- [Jewell] Yeah, it's true.

327
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,917
You're enjoying it,
it's a passion.

328
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:12,500
- Yeah, get in here.

329
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,041
I've been waiting for this.

330
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,166
I've been waiting for this!

331
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,917
Is that going to
fit there, though?

332
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:20,583
No, I don't think so.

333
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:24,041
That's why I wanted
it to go up and down.

334
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:27,500
But we might be able to hack it.

335
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,834
- [Jewell] Yeah 
because that one

336
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:30,500
could probably fit on that wall.

337
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,166
- Yeah, so you know
what we're going to do?

338
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,166
We're going to
move that up there,

339
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,583
That right there,
and that right there.

340
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,417
- [Jewell] That's badass.

341
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:40,500
Got it? Book, thing right there,

342
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,125
because it looks
thin enough, right?

343
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,333
The top one?

344
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,708
You're going to
move family business

345
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,917
to where the book thing
is, and that right there.

346
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:47,333
- [Man] Perfect.

347
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:51,083
- Alright, cool,
just put it right there.

348
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,583
Yeeeeeaaaahh, I'm
pumped about that.

349
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,125
I'm always
trying to reference it,

350
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:58,500
and then I'm like,
"fuck, where are the books?"

351
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,458
- [Jewell] So I
think that's absolutely,

352
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,208
that is so funny, with--

353
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,333
- The biggest thing
you have to get over

354
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,834
is having a dude or chick
following you around on camera.

355
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:07,250
Because that's douchey.

356
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,208
And I'm the most egotistical,
and self-promoter,

357
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,583
and it took me a couple months.

358
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,000
- [Jewell] So that's
a big thing

359
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,083
that I think was
kind of a mental block is,

360
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,083
man I'm going to
look like a douche

361
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,250
filming myself all day long.

362
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,500
- Everybody looks like a douche

363
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,792
when they start something new.

364
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:22,625
Hollywood made fun of reality TV

365
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,625
like nobody's fucking business.

366
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,333
Hollywood made
fun of the Kardashians

367
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,041
like nobody's business.

368
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,166
Everbody's a douche
until they're a pioneer.

369
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,041
- [Jewell] And it's cool.

370
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,959
In that, I've gotten
through that mental block,

371
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,542
because now I'm more
comfortable in front of it.

372
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:37,291
I can kind of be open,
and so if you're talking about

373
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,000
sharing those stories so much,

374
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,959
That's why
I think the the blog's

375
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,166
going to be great,
if I can do that.

376
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,917
- As long as you
don't bullshit it.

377
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:45,583
People that are
trying to sell $5,000,

378
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,041
I literally had a
guy email me and said,

379
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:51,083
"Hey Gary, I need you to help
me, teach me social media."

380
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,417
And there was
something in the way he asked,

381
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:53,959
I don't remember
the second part,

382
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:56,959
but he basically said,
"for my social media firm."

383
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,959
That's what it
was, right DRock?

384
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,250
So I emailed him
back and I was like,

385
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,083
"Hold on, are you charging
people to sell to social media?"

386
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,875
And he's like,
"Yeah," and I'm like,

387
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,834
"And you don't
know anything about it?"

388
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:12,125
He's like, "Yeah,"
and he didn't get it.

389
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,083
(group laughter)

390
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,875
And it scared
the shit out of me,

391
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,500
and I know why it's happening,

392
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,041
but all you have to
do is tell the truth.

393
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,083
- [Jewell] And that's my thing--

394
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,500
And again, I'm
giving you, and again,

395
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,250
you know this isn't normally
the way I push this hard.

396
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,166
It's because I actually
think you have charisma.

397
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:28,667
- [Jewell] Thank you.

398
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:29,917
And I actually
think you're starting to

399
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:33,917
give me some data,
right, like 21, 26,

400
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:35,291
you're going to
have to dig into that.

401
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,792
Oldest of four, you
have to dig into that.

402
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:39,250
- [Jewell] And I
think, so, I've been very--

403
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,959
- And remind people.

404
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,667
You know one thing, and
I'm sorry to cut you off

405
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:45,291
but I want to give you this:
I think the best thing I do,

406
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,208
and I don't get to do it often

407
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,792
'cause I keep myself in a lane,

408
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:50,750
once in a blue moon
people ask me questions in a Q&A

409
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,750
that are outside of
marketing and business,

410
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,917
and I always say,
"I don't know."

411
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:54,667
- [Jewell] Yeah.

412
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,208
And it's amazing,
I actually wish more people,

413
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,834
I feel like I'm going to start
planting people in my Q&As

414
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:02,375
to ask me something
about science, or healthcare,

415
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,500
just so I can say I don't know,

416
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,917
'cause watch all the faces
when you peacock the way I do,

417
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:08,208
and then you come
all the way the other way

418
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,625
and go, "I actually
don't know that world."

419
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:11,250
- [Jewell] Right.

420
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,166
(blows air) It's the
greatest move,

421
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,000
I wish it happened more often.

422
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,166
- [Jewell] Yeah.

423
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,250
And I think you can do that.

424
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,083
- [Jewell] It provides no
value if you bullshit people.

425
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,583
- But everybody's doing it.

426
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:24,083
And unfortunately,
we're in a world right now

427
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:27,291
where it's on the offense,
because in a world of fake news,

428
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:31,458
and fake data,
what I'm more fearful of

429
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:36,333
is if the truth
loses its place in society,

430
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:39,291
then everything,
all bets are off.

431
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,458
And so, I think I've
over-indexed it.

432
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,041
I get extremely upset
when people compare me

433
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,291
to other people that
they think are like me

434
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,375
just because of energy,
or are in your face.

435
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,834
You've just got
to have your truth,

436
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:51,917
so focus on that.

437
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:54,500
- [Jewell] And I think
one thing maybe I'll ask,

438
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,959
and I know it's
different for every person.

439
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,500
I'm very IQ oriented.
- You are?

440
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,333
- [Jewell] For architecture,
that's just how my brain works.

441
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,125
- That's great.

442
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,000
- [Jewell] I've
got that perfectionist thing

443
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,500
going on, I think.
- That's good.

444
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,250
- [Jewell] So,
I feel like I'm

445
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,667
one of the most
emotional people that I know,

446
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:10,208
but I don't, like it's so--

447
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,417
- You don't show it.

448
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:13,792
- [Jewell] It's so closed off--
- Because you protect it?

449
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:14,959
- [Jewell] I honestly
couldn't tell you.

450
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:15,750
I think it is, because I'm--

451
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,542
- Of course.

452
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,708
Do you feel like it's a cliche,

453
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,250
'cause you're a man
and you had to be the man,

454
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,083
the oldest brother?

455
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:22,917
- [Jewell] I think
a little bit of it

456
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:24,375
probably came from
being the oldest brother,

457
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,625
and like, look,
I've got to be tough,

458
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,500
and I think a
little bit of it predicates

459
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,959
itself on the
logical, like, look man,

460
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,583
nobody's going to care
about my feelings anyway.

461
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,458
It's like I've got
to figure out how to...

462
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,834
- I don't know,
I'm EQ'd out for days,

463
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:39,875
and I'm under IQ in my opinion,

464
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,417
and I talk about nobody cares
about your feelings either.

465
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:44,166
So, I think the
thing, that most,

466
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,166
so, here's
something interesting.

467
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,667
You got me into a good place.

468
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,542
I think most
people fear my blueprint,

469
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:55,458
which is, I talk in a
lot of contradictions,

470
00:15:55,458 --> 00:16:00,208
because they're true,
and I think people are scared

471
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,542
to be
pigeonholed within a micro.

472
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:04,834
- [Jewell] Hmmm. Yeah.

473
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:06,834
And I feel the
negative effects of it.

474
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:09,667
People have reactions
to me in both pro and con

475
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,000
for that reason.

476
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:13,792
I've got an answer
for you, it's similar

477
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:17,125
to document and create:
let it play out.

478
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,166
Let it play out!

479
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,208
Nobody's going to
think you're irrational

480
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,333
if you're rational
in a 50 year window.

481
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,208
Nobody's going to think
I'm a snake oil salesman

482
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,959
when it's all said and done.

483
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,375
They did, they may, they could
still believe it right now

484
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:37,708
because they're
waiting for this, like this,

485
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,583
inevitable shoe
that's going to drop.

486
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,417
That I'm going to
close all my content down,

487
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:45,000
or I've been actually
quietly taking five dollars

488
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,333
from you each
month from your Venmo.

489
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,458
Cynicism exists.
- [Jewell] Oh yeah.

490
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,500
- But the thing
that always beats cynicism

491
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,291
is the truth at
the end of the game.

492
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:57,834
- [Jewell] Yeah and obviously
you're super long term.

493
00:16:57,834 --> 00:16:58,792
- But that's it, man.

494
00:16:58,792 --> 00:16:59,875
- [Jewell] It's all long term?
- It's all long term.

495
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,166
- [Jewell] I think the
challenge--

496
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,041
- Is within the short term?

497
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,083
Well, what do you
need in the short term?

498
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,790
Because if you
care about short term,

499
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,249
it means you need something.

500
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,875
So the thing that
always drove me was,

501
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,040
I didn't need anything.

502
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,333
One great thing is,
because I didn't need to show,

503
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,665
my self confidence
was so within,

504
00:17:16,665 --> 00:17:19,207
the thing I didn't need
that so many of my friends

505
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,959
needed in their 20s
was things to put them on

506
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,834
to girls, to the world,
they needed a BMW.

507
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:26,959
They needed a watch.

508
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,792
They needed to go to
Vegas and have table service.

509
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:32,291
I didn't need those things,
which saved me a lot of money,

510
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,291
which meant I didn't need money.

511
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,792
- [Jewell] Right. Yeah, no.
Makes a lot of sense.

512
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:39,250
And especially, the 26-year-old
world that I live in

513
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,542
(Gary blows lips)
that's crazy.

514
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:44,291
And being in Dallas, you know,

515
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,959
it's a tough place to live.
- You're right.

516
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:47,000
- Even if you go
outdoors to do anything,

517
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,041
all you can do
is eat, shop, drink, party.

518
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,417
- And Dallas is
one of those places

519
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:54,708
where the dollars
and the perception

520
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,000
lead to fun stuff.
- [Jewell] Exactly, exactly.

521
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,917
I get it.
I'm empathetic to that.

522
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:02,041
Look, this is
where it gets fun.

523
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,041
This is where I get to say
the things I love the most,

524
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,333
which is okay,
and that's the game.

525
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,208
- [Jewell] Yeah, you're gonna
do whatever you want.

526
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,500
I think the one thing that
I always tells guys is like,

527
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,542
and I mean this, some
things are just true in life.

528
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,583
I think boys and girls
have to live life differently.

529
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,708
I think guys are impatient.

530
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,417
I wish guys knew that

531
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:21,917
at 40, you can be in the game

532
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:23,166
as much as 26.

533
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,792
You know, it's like,
it's a real mistake.

534
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:27,583
All these guys that
wanna hook up with chicks

535
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,959
don't realize they
should eat shit for seven years.

536
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:32,250
They'll do way better
at 33 than they will at 26

537
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,000
and have a fuck
load more leverage

538
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,667
for this
magical thing they want.

539
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:36,834
They're just posing

540
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:38,834
and getting sniffed out,

541
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,542
versus actually having it.

542
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:43,208
- [Jewell] I gotcha. So, yeah,

543
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:46,708
I totally
resonate with eat shit.

544
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:50,125
That was great.
- (laughs) Yeah.

545
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,166
- [Jewell] I guess one of the
struggles for me, obviously,

546
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,458
I'm starting this blog space.

547
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,708
So what I'm doing
currently in my career field,

548
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:59,000
I don't know if it's necessarily
in tune directly with like

549
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,250
something that's
gonna drive me for 20 years.

550
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,333
- It's definitely not.

551
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,291
- [Jewell] I don't
think it has to.

552
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,959
You already know it's not,

553
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:06,000
but that's okay.

554
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,458
There's a eat shit for that too.

555
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,708
If it's paying your bills
and giving you the air cover

556
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,959
to play a little
bit on its left hand,

557
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,959
the jab is very important.

558
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:17,000
- [Jewell] Yeah.
- Oh, the jab and the job.

559
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,708
I gotta do something with that.

560
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,834
Yeah, I love, you know.

561
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:23,291
hey finally, in
Crush It! my favorite

562
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,792
thing that I
established that I

563
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:25,959
wanna triple down on

564
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:27,959
is the 7 P.M. to
two in the morning.

565
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,750
I like the nine to five.
- [Jewell] Right.

566
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,917
- One of the things
I want people to do

567
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:32,875
is get more strategic
with their nine to five.

568
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:33,750
I would argue.

569
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,708
- [Jewell] That's exactly,
that's where I was going.

570
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,834
So right now in that space,

571
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:39,041
the job that I have,
I don't think it's

572
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,000
necessarily long term,

573
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,417
but there's
value in what I'm doing

574
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:44,834
that I can pick up
that maybe will help me

575
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:46,500
when I make that next move.

576
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,917
- And now the question becomes

577
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:49,417
Is there something
else that you can do

578
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:52,041
that pays you $10,000
less that's even more valuable

579
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,834
to where you think you're going.
- [Jewell] Gotcha.

580
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:55,875
So if you truly think
you're gonna be a personality,

581
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,959
if you truly believe that,
- [Jewell] I think I could.

582
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:58,708
- Do you think you want to?

583
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,625
I think people are
scared to say they want to

584
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,333
because of the vanity behind it.

585
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,583
I'm trying to make you feel safe

586
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:05,917
because I'm gonna
give you very, very good

587
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:06,875
piece of advice.

588
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,375
You just need to
feel safe with me.

589
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,208
- [Jewell] I think
I'm safe with it

590
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,125
and there's a lot of people
that tell me all the time.

591
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,875
Like, oh my goodness, 
you have a presence,

592
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,542
you can do this .
- Well, you do.

593
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:16,125
You've got the
looks and the vibe,

594
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:16,750
you could.

595
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,417
- [Jewell] Yeah, I mean 
I think it's something I--

596
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,750
- Well, this is
where I would say

597
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,708
you should go to L.A.
and make $15,000 less a year.

598
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,417
- [Jewell] Yeah.

599
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:24,917
'Cause you'll
stumble into more of it.

600
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:26,917
- [Jewell] Right, there's
more opportunities in L.A.

601
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:30,000
Okay. That makes sense. 
Absolutely.

602
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,625
- It's also the
time to take risks.

603
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:35,125
- [Jewell] Yeah, I could fail
it now and rebound.

604
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,000
- You can do everything
wrong for the next five years

605
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,875
and be a ridiculously young man.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

606
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,959
Like you could do nothing
productive for five years

607
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:42,917
and still be early in the game.

608
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:44,625
- [Jewell] I got you.
- That's crazy.

609
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,667
Like, I wish
kids understood that.

610
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:48,875
- [Jewell] Mhmmm. 
Yeah.

611
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:49,792
That's true.

612
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:52,000
And I love the
space that you operate in.

613
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,500
I think I'm very similar with
the contradiction of like,

614
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,125
I don't care what
anyone thinks about me

615
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,166
but at the same time 
I want everyone to like me.

616
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,291
- You care. 
I've got the same thing.

617
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,208
- [Jewell] So I guess--

618
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,500
- That's a
really good place to be.

619
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,667
I actually probably feel like

620
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:05,375
that's why I
probably like you intuitively.

621
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,792
That's the best place.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

622
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:09,875
- The genuine,
I Don't Give A Fuck,

623
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,166
for real.

624
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,291
- [Jewell] Yeah.
- And oh my God, like,

625
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:15,083
@sallypants44 in Ireland

626
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,500
with three
followers says you're a jerk.

627
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,417
I'm like fuck,
Sally Pants, no I'm not.

628
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:20,792
But that's incredible.

629
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:24,875
That's an
incredible paradox that is,

630
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,542
that I'm fascinated by
and almost wish on everybody

631
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:29,083
because then you're cruising.

632
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,000
Because really, then
you've got two gears.

633
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,333
I can turn on feeding
trolls when I want to,

634
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,333
I can turn on...

635
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,583
It's unbelievable.

636
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,375
I can turn it on
and off at any moment.

637
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,667
- [Jewell] Right.

638
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:43,291
- Just depending on
mood I'm in at that moment,

639
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,125
I can feed you and go deploy

640
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,125
being the bigger person like,

641
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,458
I'm so sorry you feel that way.

642
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,458
I hope we get to meet.

643
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,625
I do that all the time,

644
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,041
and other times I could say,

645
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,291
cool, you think I'm a dick.

646
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,125
I had one on Super Bowl night

647
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,000
where the guy's like,

648
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,291
and he's a great kid. 
I DM'ed a bunch of them.

649
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,625
I love 'em.

650
00:21:58,625 --> 00:21:59,375
Him and his bro.

651
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,500
But he was like, fuck you, Gary.

652
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,917
Tom Brady's 10 times,

653
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:05,291
100,000 times the man you are.

654
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,750
And I'm like, cool, cool.

655
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,750
Let's shelf that.

656
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,125
The problem is
Brady's a good dude too,

657
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:10,834
because he was just an athlete.

658
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:11,917
I could have won that,

659
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:13,667
but I'm like fuck,
Brady's a good dude.

660
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,417
So I was like cool,
let's shelf that for a minute.

661
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,000
What about me versus you?

662
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,959
Like, I'm willing
to pull either move.

663
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:21,500
- [Jewell] Right.
- That's a great place to be.

664
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,708
- I enjoy it.

665
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,917
I'm learning how to navigate
that, but--

666
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:26,125
- Yeah, it took me
a little while too.

667
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,417
- [Jewell] And I think that

668
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:28,875
that's probably
another reason why

669
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:29,667
I really connect with your

670
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:31,667
give, give, give, give, give.

671
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:32,500
- It's leverage.

672
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,041
- [Jewell] Never take if
you never have to.

673
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:36,667
- My great hope in life is

674
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:37,875
I never call in a favor.

675
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:41,708
- [Jewell] Yeah,
and so on that note,

676
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:43,375
I love to give. 
I'm the same way

677
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,375
and so I can create

678
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:48,458
personal relationships
very quickly with anybody.

679
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:51,875
Joe Schmoe on the street,
give, give, give.

680
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,083
One thing that I struggle with

681
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,583
and maybe I'm looking
at this the wrong way is

682
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:58,208
taking the ability to create
those personal relationships

683
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,834
and develop 
business out of them.

684
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:01,834
- Well, I think you
don't sell against it.

685
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:03,917
I think the thing
that I'd done different

686
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,959
than what people think I'm doing

687
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,834
or people that
they compare me to

688
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:09,166
is that I'm not
selling the audience.

689
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,000
- [Jewell] Right.

690
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,708
Yes, I've got a
book every three years.

691
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,542
Yes, I've got some
t-shirts here and there,

692
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:15,125
but there's
nothing meaningful there.

693
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,375
All the revenue I make
and those things combined

694
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,667
aren't as exciting as
what I do here in four minutes.

695
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:20,458
- [Jewell] Right.

696
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,583
And people don't get that.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

697
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:25,333
So what I would say is

698
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:29,208
you've got to create a
container to make money in

699
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,583
that isn't reliant
on being charismatic

700
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,333
and manipulating that
person into selling them

701
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,458
some horse shit.

702
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,041
- [Jewell] True.

703
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,750
- That's been the
great difference of me.

704
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,458
There is no $5,000 course.

705
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:42,583
There's not.

706
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:43,625
- [Jewell] Give it all
away for free.

707
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:44,708
- I do.

708
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,291
And yes, again,

709
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,333
but what has that done?

710
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,166
It's made me popular,

711
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,333
which has led to me
being a headline biller

712
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,708
for a speaking.

713
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:55,083
It led to me doing TV shows.

714
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,667
It's led to me being awareness

715
00:23:56,667 --> 00:24:00,041
around the container
I created for the agency.

716
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,583
People go to
the Wine Library to visit

717
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,708
'cause that's like the
Mecca of where I started.

718
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:04,875
Every day there's
somebody on social media

719
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,625
taking a selfie
at the Wine Library.

720
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,083
The house that GaryVee built.

721
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,625
And you know,

722
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,208
if they buy $400 worth of wine.

723
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:12,834
I guess I make
17 cents at the end.

724
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:14,375
Like, you know, like

725
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,041
to me,

726
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,583
this is where you separate it.

727
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,166
What I would recommend

728
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,458
is figure out a container
that you can put it into

729
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,041
that isn't reliant on that,

730
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,708
and there's a way
to do it without being

731
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:26,792
a good business person.

732
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:28,417
So what I was gifted with,

733
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:29,875
the thing that people forget

734
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,959
and this is a big
thing people forget.

735
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:34,625
Is I didn't say a fucking word.

736
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:37,625
Zero, zero self promotion.

737
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,667
Zero narcissism.

738
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:43,542
For 14 years.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

739
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:47,291
- And that's the
beginning of my official career.

740
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:48,917
It was even longer than that.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

741
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:50,667
- It was the triple reverse.

742
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:51,875
I was a kid,

743
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:54,083
not complaining
that I worked every day.

744
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:55,458
From 14 to 22

745
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,875
and then from
22 to basically 35,

746
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:00,917
2,000 what? Nine?

747
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,291
You know, fucking didn't talk.

748
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:05,333
I didn't talk.

749
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:07,583
- [Jewell] Just worked.
- I worked.

750
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:11,083
I gave myself
permission to talk.

751
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:11,875
- [Jewell] Yeah.

752
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:12,750
- You know and
whether people think that

753
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,250
that's right or wrong,
meaning like today,

754
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,125
that's fine,
that will work itself out,

755
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:20,083
but I was a good
businessman first.

756
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:20,792
- [Jewell] Yep.

757
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:23,500
- Like this plaque
represents 22-year-old kid

758
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,208
building a 60 million
dollar business in a retail

759
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:28,333
environment, selling
beer, liquor and wine.

760
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:29,166
- [Jewell] Yeah.

761
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:31,125
- That has nothing to
do with like, you know,

762
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:33,834
people everyday, what
has this guy ever done?

763
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:36,250
I'm like are you
so, I'm like how.

764
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,667
Now the reason I
don't get upset is,

765
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:40,417
I don't have the ego
to think that they should

766
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:41,291
have done the homework.

767
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:42,125
- [Jewell] Right.

768
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,166
- Like who am I?

769
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,083
Why should they do
the homework on my life?

770
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:46,583
They saw an Instagram video,

771
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:49,417
like, it's okay, and
by the way, my energy

772
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:53,291
does look on first sniff,
like some of the bad stuff.

773
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:55,291
- [Jewell] Yep.
- So I'm okay with that.

774
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:56,959
Here's what I'd say.
You got two moves.

775
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:58,708
One, you're either a
good enough businessman

776
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:01,417
where you've got
an architecture firm

777
00:26:01,417 --> 00:26:02,583
that makes
$3 million dollars a year

778
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:05,750
and on the side, I mean,
you know like right now,

779
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,500
GaryVee, matches my business.

780
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,291
- [Jewell] Yeah.

781
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:10,375
- But it didn't
when I was doing wine.

782
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:11,041
- [Jewell] Right.

783
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,166
- All that stuff that
happened with Crush It!

784
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:14,250
and all my
business advice, yeah, okay,

785
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,917
occasionally somebody
wanted to buy wine from me,

786
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:17,291
'cause they felt
good, but I wasn't,

787
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:20,000
it wasn't a natural flow,
and it isn't here either.

788
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,708
This company only sells
to Fortune 500 companies,

789
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:25,917
who probably look
negatively at the hype stuff.

790
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:26,750
- [Jewell] Right.

791
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,291
- So this is where
people are confused.

792
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:29,917
I have two
separate things going on.

793
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:32,917
You can do that, or you
can play it the other way,

794
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:34,625
which I think
is a very smart way

795
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,208
which is what I would be doing

796
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:38,166
if I wasn't a good businessman,

797
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:41,792
which is you can eat shit
building personal brand,

798
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,792
and instead of
monetizing the audience,

799
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:45,500
you monetize
through a third party

800
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,792
that has the
audience's attention.

801
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:49,083
What do I mean by that?

802
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:51,542
I mean you produce,
you produce, you produce,

803
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:53,708
and then a third party
conference wants to pay you

804
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:56,333
$5,000 to speak, and so
you're not selling directly

805
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:59,458
to the audience, but
you're in the B2B business

806
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:00,333
versus the B2C.

807
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:01,291
I'm in the B2B business.

808
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:02,166
- [Jewell] Yeah,
absolutely.

809
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:04,959
- My popularity is being
executed in a B2B environment.

810
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:06,959
I'm doing that with
Apple, for the show.

811
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,959
I'm doing that with these
conferences for the events.

812
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,875
I'm doing that in those ways.

813
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:13,458
I'm not doing it
direct to consumer.

814
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,500
I'm leading economics
'cause I could do it

815
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,750
direct to consumer.
- [Jewell] Yeah. Mhmmm.

816
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,458
- I'm leaving
50 cents on the dollar

817
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:21,000
and giving it to there,
but it creates such a better

818
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,917
relationship with the people.

819
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:25,208
I'm willing to leave
so much money on the table

820
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:27,041
to have you feel
about me the way you do.

821
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,875
- [Jewell] Yeah.

822
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:29,917
It makes 100% sense.

823
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:31,083
- 'Cause I'm
doing the long game.

824
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,208
- [Jewell] Yeah.

825
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:33,583
- Because all those
people making lots of money

826
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,458
on their ebook or this and that,

827
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:39,875
they're becoming 
rich for the short term,

828
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:44,250
and I'm looking to become
wealthy for the long term.

829
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,458
So if you build
and build and build,

830
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:48,208
how you turn it into
something is you start getting

831
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,083
180,000 people
following you in Instagram,

832
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:55,125
or Snapchat, or the next
platform, and they really care,

833
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:56,792
there's gonna be businesses
that find you and figure out

834
00:27:56,792 --> 00:27:58,000
how to make that move.

835
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,750
- [Jewell] Yep,
absolutely, I mean it's --

836
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,041
- And that's
where you should go.

837
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:01,875
You should do what I do.

838
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:03,792
You should go in biz dev
and use your charisma

839
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:05,250
with the biggest
brands in the world.

840
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,208
Go to conferences
where they are.

841
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:08,250
Try to reach out to them.

842
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,834
Look at everybody's
profile and be like,

843
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:12,583
oh, that's the CMO
of Kangaroo Sneakers.

844
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:14,041
Hey, Rick,
thanks for following me.

845
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:15,166
Can we get a drink?

846
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:16,917
- [Jewell] Mhmmm. Yeah.

847
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:18,750
- I do that with people,
like yesterday I saw

848
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,583
Malcolm Jamal Warner, you know,

849
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:24,708
Theo Huxtable, like said
something good about my car,

850
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:28,375
I DM'd him, like hey,
you know like biz sev,

851
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:32,500
for what you're doing,
it's easy to monetize

852
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,041
against your audience
in the short term.

853
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,458
Everybody's doing it.

854
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:37,542
It's why it will continue
to go down in value.

855
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:38,166
- [Jewell] Exactly.

856
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:40,500
So with that being
said, so, obviously,

857
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,458
you started
business side,

858
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:44,125
so me, I'm not 
necessarily starting--

859
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:46,417
- [Gary] Good, and that's
great self-awareness.

860
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:47,166
You don't have to.

861
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:51,417
- But I also, you know,
I've heard you say, you know,

862
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:52,959
go all in on what
your strengths are,

863
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:55,000
but be dangerous in the
fields that you don't, so --

864
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,834
- [Gary] Yes.

865
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:58,708
- So don't be naive
and think that you don't

866
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:00,542
have to know a little
bit about this or that.

867
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:01,417
- It's nice.

868
00:29:01,417 --> 00:29:03,000
- [Jewell] So
with that being said,

869
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,083
because I have that pickup--

870
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:05,542
- You know what I
would do if I were you?

871
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:06,375
- [Jewell] Yeah.

872
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,375
- Like I already, like
I think I figured it out.

873
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:11,083
At least I feel really good
about this piece of advice,

874
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,750
and you know I'm not
usually this definitive.

875
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,959
I think you should
go work for somebody

876
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:17,083
that you wanna become like.

877
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:19,291
I think you should
so some real homework,

878
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,417
and look at who
looks more like you.

879
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:24,208
Okay, this one, like map 'em.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

880
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:25,125
- Then you
should go work for them.

881
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:25,792
- [Jewell] 'Kay.

882
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:28,417
- And get to as
close to them as possible.

883
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:30,166
- [Jewell] That's the
biggest opportunity to learn.

884
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:32,041
- And that's where
you go and be an admin.

885
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:32,917
I being serious.

886
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:34,291
- [Jewell] Yep, okay.

887
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:35,333
Well it makes sense.
- You see where I'm goin'?

888
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:36,208
- Yeah, because --

889
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,208
- [Gary] Does anybody
stand out, like when you look

890
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:39,125
at their careers?

891
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,375
Have you done that work yet?

892
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:41,834
- Not necessarily.

893
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:45,458
This is a kind of new
space and so I just,

894
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:47,500
the reason I'm
talking about the blog is

895
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,250
because it's been something
that's kind of in my head

896
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,875
for maybe the last six
say months or something,

897
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,583
and it's kind of been that
thing that's just in the back,

898
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,333
I'm like oh, I'll get to it,
and so this year,

899
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:58,125
the second week of
January or something

900
00:29:58,125 --> 00:29:59,208
I put it on my Facebook,

901
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:00,166
I put it on and I say, hey --

902
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,125
- [Gary] You put 
yourself out there.

903
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:01,834
- [Jewell] I put 
myself out there.

904
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:03,625
- Smart. Suffocate yourself.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

905
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:04,708
So I could hold
myself accountable

906
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:07,291
and get into action,
and so with that,

907
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:09,417
I'm learning a lot more and
reaching out to different people

908
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:12,542
on running blogs, getting,
you know, traction with that

909
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:14,417
and just
different types of content,

910
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:16,625
that I think are valuable to me,

911
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:18,417
and which I think will
be valuable to other people.

912
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:20,458
- I think that's it,
like as long as it's valuable

913
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:23,875
to you, and as long
as it's true, don't judge

914
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:25,291
the content for the market.

915
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:26,125
- [Jewell] Yeah.

916
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,208
- The market will decide.

917
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:27,917
- [Jewell] Yeah.

918
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:28,917
- They just will decide.

919
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:30,250
It might not come.

920
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,542
Most people stink,
and aren't interested,

921
00:30:32,542 --> 00:30:33,875
and can't pull it off.

922
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,500
- [Jewell] Yeah.

923
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,792
- But overthinking it
upfront is wrong too.

924
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:40,291
All the breakthroughs
come when, you know,

925
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:43,041
like, otherwise there
would be no pioneering.

926
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,542
Otherwise,
there'd be no new genres.

927
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:45,166
- [Jewell] Yeah.

928
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:47,166
- Otherwise
everything would be the same.

929
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:48,667
There's always something new.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

930
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:50,458
- And the only way to
win is if it's your truth.

931
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:51,291
- [Jewell] Right.

932
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:54,291
So in order to
avoid the shotgun approach

933
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:57,000
and just like, hey let me
reach out like and laser --

934
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,083
- [Gary] I don't think so.

935
00:30:58,083 --> 00:30:59,166
- Like...

936
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:00,125
- [Gary] I'm okay with that.

937
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,333
I think whatever comes natural.

938
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:02,333
Here's what I would say.

939
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:03,875
It's more binary than that.

940
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:05,375
Produce.

941
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:06,208
- [Jewell] Just put it out
there --

942
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:08,375
- I think your logic,

943
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:10,875
I'm not gonna give you
a framework or a blueprint

944
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,125
that's that detailed.

945
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:13,291
- [Jewell] Yeah. Well, yeah.

946
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:14,542
- It's macro.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

947
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:15,917
- It's making the switch.

948
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:17,250
It's the bigger
thing that I've been poking

949
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,500
at periodically
through this conversation.

950
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,166
- [Jewell] Yeah.

951
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:21,583
- Give yourself
permission to be willing

952
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,166
to be a personality,
even though you think

953
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:25,250
it's a little douchey
and a little less logical,

954
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,250
and has some baggage,
and once you own it,

955
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,583
well then you're on
your way, because right now

956
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:30,625
you're half pregnant.

957
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:31,667
- [Jewell] Yeah.

958
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:34,375
You want it, but
you're not ready to go there,

959
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:37,083
and boy do I get it because,
again, I'm so comfortable

960
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:40,083
in my skin, and this took time.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

961
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:41,542
- And I knew this
was the right move.

962
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:44,166
I knew documenting
everyday was the right move,

963
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:46,250
but I was like, whew.

964
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,250
Actually, you
and I were together

965
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,166
like the third day I did it.

966
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:50,625
- Oh we were?
- [Gary] Yep!

967
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:51,959
- [DRock] Remember that episode.

968
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:52,792
- [Gary] In Vegas.

969
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:54,625
- [Erik] Oh, that's right, yes!

970
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:55,625
- That's where I
was still trying.

971
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,959
I was like this is so weird.

972
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:00,333
Now it's like so normal.

973
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:01,333
(laughter)

974
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:02,458
I don't even know he's here.

975
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:03,417
- [Jewell] Exactly.

976
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:04,708
- It's crazy.

977
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:05,667
It's crazy.

978
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:09,333
Like it makes me really
understand why reality TV works.

979
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:12,083
Like humans get really
accustomed to their environment.

980
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:14,750
- Yeah, and I think
documenting yourself,

981
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,125
one thing that I struggle with

982
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:18,667
that frustrates
the hell out of me

983
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:21,542
is I know it's a talent,
I know it's something

984
00:32:21,542 --> 00:32:23,625
that some people are born
with and some people aren't

985
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:26,834
but something will happen
in my day-to-day life,

986
00:32:26,834 --> 00:32:29,959
that like the light bulb won't
click for like three hours

987
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:32,500
after or two weeks later,
I'm like oh shit,

988
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,500
I missed that by being
able to like really perceive

989
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,208
my own thoughts in the moment.

990
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:38,792
I think that's something
that you're really good at.

991
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:40,792
You're like, oh shit,
okay, let's go act on that.

992
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,625
- [Gary] I do.

993
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:44,583
- Do you think there's
any way to like hone that in,

994
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:45,667
to like really develop that?

995
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:46,875
- Probably.

996
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:47,834
I don't know how.

997
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:48,667
- [Jewell] Yeah.

998
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:49,667
I mean, I know
documenting for me,

999
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,375
like going back
and watching things,

1000
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:53,291
like that day that
I recorded, I'm like,

1001
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:54,625
oh damn, okay I can change--

1002
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:56,792
- Interesting, that's cool.

1003
00:32:56,792 --> 00:32:59,000
Yeah, it comes
so intuitive to me.

1004
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,083
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1005
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:03,708
- I mean I would make the most
drastic decision on a whim

1006
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:04,792
that you could ever imagine.

1007
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:06,792
- [Jewell] Yeah,
'cause you can rebuild.

1008
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:08,708
- Yeah.
'Cause I'm not scared.

1009
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:09,667
- [Jewell] I think
that's the biggest thing.

1010
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:10,500
- I'm not scared.

1011
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,333
- [Jewell] For a
lot of people.

1012
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:13,542
I mean, I'm not
scared but I'm scared.

1013
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,375
I don't have the VaynerMedia--

1014
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:16,959
- Yeah, but I had
it the whole time.

1015
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:18,625
I think it's a DNA thing.

1016
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:19,917
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1017
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:22,250
- Every time
somebody goes, but this...

1018
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,708
I'm like, no, no, no.

1019
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:25,208
I was here.

1020
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:27,250
Like, where do you think I was?

1021
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,000
- [Jewell] More, more, more.

1022
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,291
- Like you know,
more, more, more.

1023
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:31,125
Did you see Drake?

1024
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:33,542
- [Jewell] I saw,
I saw that (laughs).

1025
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:38,500
- I don't think it's true,
but it's surely wild.

1026
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,333
That was wild.

1027
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:40,166
- [Jewell] Gained 
a lot of traction.

1028
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:42,708
- No, I still can't
wrap my head around it.

1029
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:44,750
I just don't see the
path of how that hit his radar

1030
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,083
so quickly and I don't
have that direct link,

1031
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,375
but you never know.

1032
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:49,834
- [Jewell] I think you're
bigger than you think though.

1033
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:52,250
- No, I feel good in my reach.

1034
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,166
It just newish, too.

1035
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:55,583
It happened too fast.

1036
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:56,792
Trust me, if I
pushed it hard for

1037
00:33:56,792 --> 00:33:58,375
three, four or five
months, and then it happened,

1038
00:33:58,375 --> 00:33:59,875
I would have been, like, yeah!

1039
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:01,625
Just seemed like it
happened way too fast.

1040
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:02,875
But maybe, I don't know.

1041
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:03,875
- [Jewell] A couple weeks,
a week, what?

1042
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,667
- Yeah. 
- [Jewell] How long?

1043
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:08,041
- It's really, what 
do you think DRock?

1044
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:09,083
No, no, what do you think?

1045
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,667
You think it's got a chance?

1046
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:13,041
I feel like the only
chance is one of his boys

1047
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:14,542
is following--
- [DRock] Yeah.

1048
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:15,833
- Said it,
he picked up, (fingers snap)

1049
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:16,792
That's the path.

1050
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:18,750
- [Jewell] That's the millenial
space that you operate in.

1051
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,792
- Exactly right, no, that I
believe potentially is true.

1052
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:24,333
Without even one knowing.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1053
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,667
- It was funny. Okay.

1054
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:29,208
- So, yeah, alright, well I mean

1055
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:34,458
it seems like I just
need to stop being a pussy

1056
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:36,083
and just get after it (laughs).

1057
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:39,625
- [Gary] I think so man,
here's what I would say,

1058
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:40,708
so you know what's cool?

1059
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:44,500
I can give this advice 'cause
I don't have it in business,

1060
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,750
but I have it in other places.

1061
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,250
I didn't learn how to swim
until I was nine years old.

1062
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,958
And the only
reason I learned to swim

1063
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:51,583
was my six year old sister.

1064
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:54,125
I was playing Knock
Hockey at the pool club,

1065
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,291
and I heard from a distance,

1066
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:58,208
that my mom was
cheering (hands clap)

1067
00:34:58,208 --> 00:35:00,041
my sister had
just learn how to swim.

1068
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:02,750
Before she was
finished clapping,

1069
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:07,333
I had my shirt off,
jumped in, and started swimming

1070
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:09,500
because I didn't want
the historical narrative

1071
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,625
to be that my sister
learned how to swim before me.

1072
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:12,667
- [Jewell] So competitive.

1073
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:15,583
- So competitive.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1074
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:18,583
- Jumping off that cliff
in Jamaica on spring break,

1075
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,917
I'm scared of heights
and things like that, right?

1076
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:23,000
That's what it takes,

1077
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,875
it takes just
jumping in the pool,

1078
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,375
and then the second you do it,

1079
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:29,250
it's your first kiss,
it's everything, it's that.

1080
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:29,917
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1081
00:35:29,917 --> 00:35:31,625
You're just gonna have to do it.

1082
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:32,750
And I think the
best way to do it is

1083
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,667
a similar version of how you
called yourself out on social,

1084
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,834
but a more
extreme version, which is,

1085
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:39,834
go map who you want to be like,

1086
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:41,708
email them cold,
and their inner circle,

1087
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:43,375
until one of them says,
sure, you can come work

1088
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:46,333
for me for free as my
admin or my chief of staff,

1089
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:48,000
and move to L.A. and do it.

1090
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,083
- [Jewell] Makes sense.

1091
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,917
- It will work.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1092
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:53,166
- Here's why,
you can always go back

1093
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:54,959
to what you're
doing now in 24 months.

1094
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:58,166
The practical world
is always open armed.

1095
00:35:58,166 --> 00:35:59,375
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1096
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:00,542
- It's what the
whole thing is built for.

1097
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:02,208
- [Jewell] Yeah.
- That's what people don't get.

1098
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:03,708
The practical world?

1099
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:05,125
The way school is built,

1100
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:06,083
to be an employee?

1101
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:08,083
They're waiting for you always.

1102
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,333
They're always there for you.

1103
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,875
- [Jewell] Mhmmm.

1104
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:13,542
- To me, that's
how I see the world.

1105
00:36:13,542 --> 00:36:15,125
It's actually a
no risk game.

1106
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:17,542
It doesn't go away.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1107
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:21,041
- It's always there.

1108
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:22,000
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1109
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,959
- [DRock] I also think
the narrative of DailyVee

1110
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:26,500
is interesting too, because
we didn't start daily.

1111
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,375
We started three times,
two times a week,

1112
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:32,583
where we just were
trying to figure it out.

1113
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:33,959
- I iterate a lot.

1114
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:35,291
People think I figure--

1115
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:38,291
I figure out macros,-- 
- [DRock] Yep.

1116
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:40,500
- and then it takes sometimes
years to get to the micro.

1117
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,333
- [Jewell] Yeah. 
- [DRock] Yep.

1118
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,166
- [Jewell] I
think that's exactly it.

1119
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:45,417
I try and micro
it out before I--

1120
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:46,667
- [Gary] Everybody does.
- Yeah.

1121
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:48,166
- [Gary] that's why 
I'm successful.

1122
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:48,667
- Yeah.

1123
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:52,458
- [Gary] Success is predicated
on pushing as high as you can,

1124
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:54,333
and then working backwards.

1125
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:56,208
Everybody else tries to go up.

1126
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:58,583
- [Jewell] Yeah. Well
that's--

1127
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,708
- You know?

1128
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:02,667
I wonder when I
realized how strategic

1129
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:05,708
the narrative of
buying the Jets was?

1130
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:07,667
- [Jewell] Hmm.
- You know?

1131
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:10,625
That's just my disguise for
being obsessed with the journey.

1132
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:12,333
- [Jewell] Yep.
- I wish it never ended.

1133
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,792
The reason I don't want to
die and talk about my funeral

1134
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:16,458
has nothing to do
with anything other than

1135
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:18,959
I'm in complete bliss.

1136
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:20,250
- [Jewell] Yeah.
- I'm doin' it.

1137
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,208
I'm doin' it my way,
the way I was built to do,

1138
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,166
and it's clean.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1139
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:27,208
- And everything
else is secondary.

1140
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:30,083
The followers,
the money, the attention,

1141
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:34,291
they're all such a
distant secondary to that space.

1142
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:37,542
That pure space of doing
exactly what you want to do

1143
00:37:37,542 --> 00:37:40,000
every second of your life,
the way you wanted to do it.

1144
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,834
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1145
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:42,875
Which is why I
struggled so much with school.

1146
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:44,834
It was the complete reverse.

1147
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:47,125
It was rules
and structure around

1148
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:49,458
something I couldn't believe in.

1149
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:52,959
And that's why I feel so
much pain for the masses.

1150
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:55,959
Because I feel like
that's everybody's job.

1151
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:58,125
- [Jewell] There's a lot of
drones out there, unfortunately.

1152
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:00,375
They just don't know
how to break out of that

1153
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:02,708
and I think that's why,

1154
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:05,166
I think the blog
space is going to be

1155
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:07,834
big for me because
it does play on my

1156
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:10,333
coaching and leadership
for my little brothers

1157
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,291
and really taking that,--

1158
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,750
- [Gary] As long as you stay
in your lane, you will win.

1159
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,667
Stay in that lane.

1160
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:17,667
Make those analogies.

1161
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:19,333
I'm able to break
out of my lane because

1162
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:22,625
I make analogies
of things of how,

1163
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:25,834
the reason people throw
me in to the motivation,

1164
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:28,083
I'm talking about life,
though the lens of business.

1165
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,291
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1166
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:31,667
It's why my parenting
advice goes so far,

1167
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:33,750
that's why I'm
writing Perfectly Parented.

1168
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,250
'Cause it's operations--

1169
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,291
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1170
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:40,375
- It's reverse engineering
a human being.

1171
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:42,458
It's all that stuff.

1172
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:45,125
It's people's behavior.

1173
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:46,875
I understand it.
- [Jewell] Right.

1174
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:48,166
- That's why this
is easy for me.

1175
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:49,708
- [Jewell] Yeah. 
I know I'm right.

1176
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:51,333
- [Jewell] Mhmmm, yeah.

1177
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:53,375
I know you're
right, too (laughs).

1178
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,708
- And so I think the reason
people are attracted to me

1179
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,542
is there's a little bit of that

1180
00:38:57,542 --> 00:39:00,125
immigrant, Jersey, street thing

1181
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:02,583
that everybody gets
value in different ways.

1182
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:06,208
Some people need a little
bit of an East-coast push,

1183
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:08,000
that's my natural
way of communicating

1184
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,917
and that works for some people.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1185
00:39:09,917 --> 00:39:12,250
- That's why it works for,
a lot of young guys love me,

1186
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,542
'cause it works for them.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1187
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:16,625
- They can associate.

1188
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:19,834
Middle America grandmas,
not as much.

1189
00:39:19,834 --> 00:39:22,250
The f-bomb is a binary turn-off.

1190
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,792
- [Jewell] It's so funny
how many people are like,

1191
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:24,792
oh but he...

1192
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:26,125
I'm like you
don't even understand,

1193
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:27,375
get past the f-bomb--

1194
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:28,542
- But you have to understand,

1195
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:30,417
the cursing's really
fun for me because

1196
00:39:30,417 --> 00:39:34,583
if one is inable
to get through cursing

1197
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:37,125
to get to the message,
they have no shot

1198
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,834
of listening to my advice.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1199
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,917
- It's almost another
subconscious mechanism

1200
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:42,417
to not let people in.

1201
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:44,291
I actually think
my whole life is that.

1202
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:45,125
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1203
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:47,625
I think I act in a way that vets

1204
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:49,375
people before they get to me.

1205
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:51,333
It's not even for me,
you know what's so funny?

1206
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:52,542
I don't need anybody.
- [Jewell] Yep.

1207
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:53,834
- It's that there's no chance

1208
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:55,333
they're gonna get
value out of me,

1209
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:57,083
people that are
actually attracted to me

1210
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:59,417
struggle with the
macro-nature of my message.

1211
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:01,250
If you're stopping at cursing,

1212
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,875
you've got no prayer.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1213
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:05,208
You're stopping at fucking,
the first floor,

1214
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:07,959
I'm trying to get you
to the 72nd penthouse.

1215
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:09,792
The people that
like me get to 55,

1216
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:12,500
but getting 55 to
72 is a lot of work.

1217
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,000
If you're stopping at floor one,

1218
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,500
I'm not getting you there.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1219
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,917
- If you're literally
scared because of cursing,

1220
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:19,667
in today's world, that's
what you're gonna like,

1221
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,208
that's what's stopping you from

1222
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:22,792
hearing the
purity of the message?

1223
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:24,500
Like, you're literally
getting ripped off by

1224
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,083
people that are
selling you stuff

1225
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:28,458
garbage, garbage
because they don't curse,

1226
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:31,291
and I'm out of consideration
because of my cursing,

1227
00:40:31,291 --> 00:40:32,917
you are a fucking loser.

1228
00:40:32,917 --> 00:40:35,917
- [Jewell] Yeah, I absolutely
agree, I tell people (mumbles)

1229
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:37,333
you guys don't understand.

1230
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:40,083
And you've effectively
become a mentor to me,

1231
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:42,208
you got that mentor
video out and everybody's like,

1232
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:43,041
oh, you won't be my--

1233
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:45,792
you are a mentor, I
watch you and I soak it in.

1234
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:48,333
- The mentor
video was another proxy.

1235
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:50,750
- People aren't looking, like,

1236
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,417
it's the Wizard of Oz.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1237
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:54,417
- They take everything literal.

1238
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:57,041
I do everything
to weed people out.

1239
00:40:57,041 --> 00:40:58,458
- [Jewell] Mhmmm. 
- To judge people.

1240
00:40:58,458 --> 00:40:59,875
That's how I
scale big businesses.

1241
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,959
All my rules
and all my structure

1242
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,917
is to actually know who you are.

1243
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:05,333
When you leave a comment

1244
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:06,875
that like I'm
wrong about mentorship,

1245
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:08,667
it gives me an insight to how
you're thinking about things

1246
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:10,583
'cause you actually
didn't hear me in that video,

1247
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:13,041
which is an insight into
where your mind is right now.

1248
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:13,875
- [Jewell] Right.

1249
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:16,083
- That video
wasn't about mentorship.

1250
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:18,417
That video was about, go do.

1251
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:20,250
That video was more, more, more.

1252
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,166
You have to execute.
- [Jewell] Yep.

1253
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:24,959
- If you keep wanting a mentor,
and a book, and a course,

1254
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:27,083
you're just in the
game of the learning.

1255
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:28,708
The learning is safe to you.

1256
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:30,500
You're paying for safety.
- [Jewell] Yep.

1257
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,708
- These people are
piranhas on your safety needs.

1258
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,166
I want you out.

1259
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,083
- [Jewell] And I think that's--

1260
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,750
- Like, these people
want more followers

1261
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,125
and want people to
stay, I want everybody out.

1262
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:42,625
I want to have 4,000,000
followers and zero engagement.

1263
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,792
- [Jewell] Mhmmm.

1264
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,417
That's the reverse.

1265
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:46,208
- [Jewell] It's so
funny because

1266
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:47,333
you've done that
exact thing to me.

1267
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:50,500
So I was very much
learn, learn, learn, perfect.

1268
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,250
And like after
watching you, I got...

1269
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,583
It's a transition,
I'm growing out of it,

1270
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:55,667
but it's funny how

1271
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:58,458
I take action faster.
- [Gary] I'm pushing you.

1272
00:41:58,458 --> 00:41:59,667
I'm pushing you.

1273
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:01,250
- [Jewell] That's why I said
you're like a real mentor.

1274
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,083
- The reason people
leave a struggle with me

1275
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:05,583
is I'm making
them uncomfortable.

1276
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:07,000
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1277
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,166
- They're struggling because,

1278
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:10,291
I'm exposing its truth.

1279
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:11,125
- [Jewell] Yep.

1280
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:11,959
- And everybody else is,

1281
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:12,792
like,

1282
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:14,792
they genuinely don't like me,

1283
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:17,125
pushing them for
free to their truth.

1284
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:21,792
They'd rather pay somebody to
reinforce their shortcomings.

1285
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:23,291
I mean it's insane.

1286
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,750
- [Jewell] You can't do
anything in the comfort zone.

1287
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,708
- But here's why I do it.

1288
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:28,583
The legacy.

1289
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:29,834
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1290
00:42:29,834 --> 00:42:32,125
- Nobody goes to
those people and say,

1291
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:34,417
"Thank you for
what you did for me."

1292
00:42:34,417 --> 00:42:37,166
They go to those
people 23 years later and say,

1293
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:38,375
"You fucked me pretty good."

1294
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:40,000
- [Jewell] Yep.
- You got me.

1295
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,417
- [Jewell] Your whole
legacy is gonna be predicated

1296
00:42:42,417 --> 00:42:43,583
on how many other GaryVees--

1297
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,708
- A hundred thousand,
and when you factor that,

1298
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:47,708
do you know that
your grandchildren

1299
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:48,708
are gonna watch this video?

1300
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:50,333
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1301
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:53,834
- Do you understand they're
gonna be kids when I'm dead,

1302
00:42:53,834 --> 00:42:55,083
for thirty years,
that are gonna watch this,

1303
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:56,333
who love you,

1304
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:57,917
who you're their grandfather.

1305
00:42:57,917 --> 00:42:58,750
And they're gonna be like,

1306
00:42:58,750 --> 00:42:59,583
that

1307
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,125
that was when,

1308
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:02,708
like,

1309
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:04,792
could you imagine?

1310
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:06,542
Could you imagine if
there was video right now

1311
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,375
of this nature

1312
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:11,208
of some iconic
individual, or even,

1313
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:12,959
iconic in your own family?

1314
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:15,083
Like that person that made it?

1315
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:17,375
I couldn't imagine
watching videos of my dad

1316
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,750
sitting in a room

1317
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:21,417
being in America for one
year with a heavy accent,

1318
00:43:21,417 --> 00:43:22,333
getting good advice.

1319
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,583
Like, that's insane.

1320
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:24,542
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1321
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:25,792
- That's, that's
very attractive to me.

1322
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:28,208
- [Jewell] With like,
you know, Instagram stories

1323
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:29,542
and Snapchat stories,
and things like that,

1324
00:43:29,542 --> 00:43:31,208
because I'm putting
more and more stuff out,

1325
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,375
everyday I make it a point to
save it, and I'm storing it.

1326
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:34,208
- [Gary] Yep.

1327
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:35,583
- So that like, later
on I can go back and look.

1328
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:36,834
And even a week later, I'm like,

1329
00:43:36,834 --> 00:43:39,000
"Damn, that happened last week?
I forgot about that piece."

1330
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,625
But, you know it's
instant frame of mind.

1331
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:44,708
- I was watching the Grammys
last night and these tributes,

1332
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:46,375
and I'm like,
that's what I'm drawn to.

1333
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:47,834
I'm like, I want tributes.

1334
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:49,208
- [Jewell] Yep.

1335
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:50,375
- I just do.

1336
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:51,875
And like, fine.

1337
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:54,125
You can be mad
at me for that, but

1338
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:55,583
I find it amazing.

1339
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,291
I feel like people
who are really obsessed

1340
00:43:57,291 --> 00:43:59,333
with their legacy
give the world the most.

1341
00:43:59,333 --> 00:43:59,875
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1342
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:01,041
- Because that's
their selfishness.

1343
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:02,333
Post-game.

1344
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:03,875
Everybody else
is trying to take.

1345
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:08,333
- [Jewell] Yeah.
That makes so much sense.

1346
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:09,708
- Go find who you
think you're like.

1347
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:11,125
Go do some real homework.
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1348
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:13,375
- Find the person that's, you
know I'm not that exact thing.

1349
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:16,792
Find that balance of
charisma, practicality.

1350
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:19,417
Try to figure out who that is,

1351
00:44:19,417 --> 00:44:20,542
and then go work for them.

1352
00:44:20,542 --> 00:44:22,542
That is the best piece of
advice I could give anybody.

1353
00:44:22,542 --> 00:44:23,375
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1354
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:26,834
- Go work for the
person you think you are.

1355
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:28,083
- [Jewell] Yep.

1356
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,250
- 'Cause,

1357
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,291
hence, their success,

1358
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:31,500
you know.

1359
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,792
The successful version of you.

1360
00:44:32,792 --> 00:44:33,625
- [Jewell] Right.

1361
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:36,417
- Because if you map
with that person 80%,

1362
00:44:36,417 --> 00:44:37,708
like DRock and I

1363
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,875
map philosophically.

1364
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:41,083
It's not like we
have the same skills,

1365
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:42,250
but we're the same kind of

1366
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,500
dude in our heart.

1367
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,333
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1368
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:45,166
- So that helps.

1369
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:46,000
So like,

1370
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,291
watching him
evolve in 24 months,

1371
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:50,291
there was no filmmaker
that was gonna teach him that.

1372
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:51,125
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1373
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:52,625
- Maybe there is, but
do you know what I mean?

1374
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:54,333
And by the way, if
there is that filmmaker

1375
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:56,750
with that EQ mapping, that
would have been the person.

1376
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,792
- [Jewell] Mhmmm. 
- But,

1377
00:44:58,792 --> 00:45:00,458
it helps.

1378
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:01,375
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1379
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:02,708
It makes a whole lot of sense.

1380
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:03,792
I'm gonna have
to do my homework.

1381
00:45:03,792 --> 00:45:04,625
- Do your homework.

1382
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:05,458
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1383
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:06,333
I'll have to keep
you updated on that.

1384
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:07,166
- Please.

1385
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:08,583
- [Jewell] I'm also,

1386
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:10,500
I'm late to this
party but I'm jumping in

1387
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,792
the 2017 challenge.

1388
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,291
- [Gary] You are?
- Yeah, so.

1389
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:16,125
- [Gary] Well by the way,
that's interesting to me because

1390
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:20,708
you know, you didn't come across
as hardcore, like selling,

1391
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:22,959
because we didn't
go down that path.

1392
00:45:22,959 --> 00:45:26,208
To me, the biggest reason
I love the 2017 Flip Challenge

1393
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:27,291
is because

1394
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:28,625
teaching people how to,

1395
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:29,959
you know that whole, like,
you can bring them to the,--

1396
00:45:29,959 --> 00:45:30,792
- [Jewell] Yeah.

1397
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:31,834
- You teach people how to sell,

1398
00:45:31,834 --> 00:45:33,291
you unlock a
totally different thing.

1399
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:34,125
- [Jewell] Right.

1400
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:35,792
Yeah, no, I'm excited about it.

1401
00:45:35,792 --> 00:45:37,458
- I can't wait for
this spring and summer,

1402
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:39,250
when everybody's garage-saling,
and flea-marketing.

1403
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:40,083
- Oh yeah.

1404
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:41,500
- I can't wait to, my
weekends are gonna be so fun

1405
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:45,333
with people like,
sending out details of like.

1406
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:47,125
By the way, it's
been such a selfish thing.

1407
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:49,083
People posting,
"I bought this t-shirt

1408
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:50,708
"at the thrift
store for a dollar.

1409
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:51,875
"I sold it for $9.99."

1410
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:53,959
That high, of the flip,

1411
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:56,041
even not even my money
is the greatest.

1412
00:45:56,041 --> 00:45:57,792
- [Jewell] Right, you're
creating business people.

1413
00:45:57,792 --> 00:45:59,417
- It's not even that,
I love the flip.

1414
00:45:59,417 --> 00:46:00,458
- [Jewell] Yeah.
- The action.

1415
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:01,291
- [Jewell] Yeah, right.

1416
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,125
- Yeah, I'm like, "Oh my God,

1417
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:03,333
"you bought a Smurf
figure for 40 cents,

1418
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:04,667
"and it's nine bucks?"

1419
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:06,208
I just get off on the flip.

1420
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:08,333
It's not even like,
that one's not as noble.

1421
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:11,583
That's just a short term
action of the flip.

1422
00:46:11,583 --> 00:00:00,000
(dramatic music)
