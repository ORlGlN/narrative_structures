1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:11,040
morning hey guys uh so you know I I just

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">listen to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and have a good sense of</font>

3
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,969
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> following the tweets and I think we</font>

4
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:17,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">can probably all weirdly agree that at</font>

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,620
some level this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid</font>

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,870
conference right because if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think</font>

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,340
about it the thought of having a

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,730
conference to like push the envelope of

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,860
getting everybody to think about mobile

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,980
as an important place to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things is</font>

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,980
ludicrous right the I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> for anybody</font>

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,190
to not understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the closest</font>

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing to the extension of a human being</font>

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,750
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> like for anybody to even debate</font>

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,000
that everything you know we're now 20

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,040
years into the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> state of the</font>

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,230
internet right you know like it's been

18
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,899
20 years since windows 95 came out and

19
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,630
normal people non nerds went on the

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,600
platform and so we now have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the luxury</font>

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,630
of recognizing that all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

22
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,730
just repeat themselves like everybody

23
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,920
thinks I like I know some of you know me

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,200
and some don't but I have a built a

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,540
large wine business mainly on web one

26
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,720
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> o dynamics right you know 1996</font>

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">ecommerce site email</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> marketing banner</font>

28
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,140
google adwords and then social<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

29
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,729
came along which you know for a lot of

30
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:22,260
us we remember was really just called

31
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,940
web two point oh and they just changed

32
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,700
the word right and so these things came

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,830
along and then all the dynamics you know

34
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,880
everyone's like oh you're so good at

35
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,830
social media I'm like right because it's

36
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">just like email marketing it's just like</font>

37
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,299
direct mail it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the same</font>

38
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,210
thing meaning even<font color="#E5E5E5"> this company which I</font>

39
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,250
was an angel investor in button the

40
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,159
theory was we did this for desktop we're

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">just going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it for app culture it's</font>

42
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,950
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> curious I almost want to turn</font>

43
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,110
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a weird QA instead of a talk</font>

44
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,810
I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> curious if this is even a</font>

45
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,759
worthwhile conversation isn't this a

46
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,830
complete foregone conclusion I almost

47
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel like I'm going to start a</font>

48
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,939
conference called oxygen con oxygen

49
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,310
matters of course it matters like there

50
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,860
is nothing else like like there is no

51
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">other ecosystem that's going to matter</font>

52
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,300
in the business world this is where the

53
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">money is going to be this is where the</font>

54
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,530
action is this is the first second

55
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,360
I run a 600 person digital social

56
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,880
advertising agency right now and you

57
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,050
know there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of terminology like</font>

58
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,880
the first screen the second screen a lot

59
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,650
of people refer to this as a second

60
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,990
screen because I guess the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TV's supposed</font>

61
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,170
to be the first screen this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the first</font>

62
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,750
second third fourth fifth and sixth

63
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,060
screen right I dropped my phone the

64
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,190
other day and my glass cracked and so I

65
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,720
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it changed an apple said</font>

66
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,040
cool you can get a change come to the

67
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,200
 genius<font color="#E5E5E5"> bar I go I get there I'm</font>

68
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,280
supposed to get it back in two hours I

69
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,720
said oh weird we have to give it to you

70
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">tomorrow morning I literally ran home</font>

71
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,610
and walked around<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my laptop because</font>

72
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">I couldn't not be connected</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

73
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:54,690
literally everywhere like outside took

74
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,280
my kids to Central Park holding my

75
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,230
laptop because i need to get my text

76
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,810
messages in that place<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean the</font>

77
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,410
thought the debate that this even needs

78
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,900
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talked about or like there's no</font>

79
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,260
conference that addresses this maybe not

80
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,940
in the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> narrow sense but every</font>

81
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,590
conference addresses it like what do we

82
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,630
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> when we talk about consumer</font>

83
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,280
behavior and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are happening</font>

84
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,329
everything it only comes from mobile app

85
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:23,100
culture I don't know and then the

86
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">commerce part maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just share</font>

87
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:27,299
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might be interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

88
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:29,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorta day I still in my family wine</font>

89
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:30,870
business I haven't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> been involved</font>

90
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,280
with it that much but recently in the

91
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,810
last year I've gotten a little bit more

92
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,450
involved and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I started an Instagram</font>

93
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,959
account called wine deals so real

94
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,640
quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I be awesome if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys would</font>

95
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,150
follow that account and so wine deals is

96
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,890
an account<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> created mainly to</font>

97
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,989
just sell wine at a ridiculously low

98
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:50,760
price<font color="#CCCCCC"> and free shipping on bottle number</font>

99
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">one there was a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of innovation in the</font>

100
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">wine space that followed the group on</font>

101
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:57,600
living social model of<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal the day kind</font>

102
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,790
of dynamics and I felt that Instagram

103
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,650
had an opportunity to become the next

104
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,900
arbitrage of that same exact behavior

105
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,780
aka the same stuff just works everywhere

106
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,609
else you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have to deploy it and make</font>

107
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:10,290
it contextual to the reality of that

108
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">marketplace as many of you guys know in</font>

109
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,760
Instagram because of the functionality

110
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,160
people tag their friends all day long in

111
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,720
the comments which creates enormous

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,910
awareness because Instagram right now is

113
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,770
dominating the attention graph which oh

114
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,810
by the way is the only thing

115
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,370
that matters always and forever

116
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,870
it's about attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> you reverse</font>

117
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,430
engineer it that's where the money is

118
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,020
that's why all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this that we'll talk</font>

119
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,729
about today is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work because all</font>

120
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:36,250
our attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> is directly transposed in</font>

121
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,220
here 24 7 365 and that's why it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

122
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,360
to work and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> people figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out how</font>

123
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,830
to make it work in that environment so

124
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">Instagram which owns the attention graph</font>

125
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,240
in a social environment because I can

126
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,770
have 1 million Twitter followers and

127
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,840
tweet something and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 58 things will</font>

128
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,880
happen i can have 150,000 followers on

129
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">instagram</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and four thousand things will</font>

130
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,210
happen that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> attention that's a</font>

131
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">that matters ninety percent of the</font>

132
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,180
market cares about with because they're

133
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,800
 stupid it's all about depth

134
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,600
that's where you actually make things

135
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen and so you should check out at</font>

136
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,710
wine deals because<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's what's</font>

137
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,360
interesting as<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody is trying to</font>

138
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,190
figure out what's the ROI and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

139
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,080
make this happen commerce in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile is</font>

140
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,419
so phenomenal that the execution<font color="#CCCCCC"> of wine</font>

141
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:18,370
deals right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now is such horseshit it</font>

142
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,199
makes me so embarrassed that I'm

143
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,090
associated with it right because it's

144
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,250
Instagram you put a picture you

145
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,780
can't link out if you're not running an

146
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,539
ad so literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> you push a picture of a</font>

147
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,130
bottle of wine you give the information

148
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,430
there's a discount code in the

149
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,950
post because Wine Library<font color="#CCCCCC"> com is a piece</font>

150
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,910
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I haven't paid attention</font>

151
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,400
to it in a while and so you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

152
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,250
then the link out is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually in your</font>

153
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,870
profile<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that's the only way you</font>

154
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,639
can lick it out you link it out it sends

155
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">you to the current offer it's a complete</font>

156
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,539
disaster show there's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> good the</font>

157
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:52,419
level of friction is so insane you get

158
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,310
like burn on your thumb for even being

159
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,570
involved right yet with all that we sell

160
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:04,020
a fuckload of wine through it because

161
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">commerce and mobile is a foregone</font>

162
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,979
conclusion because<font color="#CCCCCC"> commerce happens</font>

163
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:11,289
wherever attention is and that's what

164
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:13,120
this whole thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that's what</font>

165
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,919
it's about it's as simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> as that the</font>

166
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:17,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">only asset that matters to everybody in</font>

167
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:20,590
this world is broken down in the

168
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,389
following order number one you care

169
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:24,190
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> family and the people you</font>

170
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">love number two you care about money</font>

171
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,130
right and number three and this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

172
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,389
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most interesting one I'll tell you a</font>

173
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:32,680
story about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that will contextualize</font>

174
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,780
my whole thesis on what matters<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

175
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,630
number three is<font color="#E5E5E5"> time time has become</font>

176
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,190
outrageously important to all of us

177
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,289
because we live in a 24-7

178
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:44,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">65 world now and so one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big</font>

179
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,689
mistakes in my investment career<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

180
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:50,369
passed on the angel<font color="#E5E5E5"> round of uber twice</font>

181
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:54,939
which really hurts and and the reason I

182
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:57,369
invested in the next round was because

183
00:06:57,369 --> 00:06:59,409
my brother AJ took the first uber in New

184
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:00,849
York<font color="#CCCCCC"> City when Travis came he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said hey</font>

185
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:02,259
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys test this out so AJ takes</font>

186
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:04,330
the uber we're sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our office it</font>

187
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,770
takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to burr he goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inside and I'd</font>

188
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,779
used uber in San Francisco at this point

189
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:09,430
but there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just something about it</font>

190
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">working out in New York where we have</font>

191
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:12,849
the greatest transportation of all time

192
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">and one hundredth of a second before you</font>

193
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:18,129
know AJ takes the uber were in the

194
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:19,930
office still<font color="#E5E5E5"> just jamming on what we had</font>

195
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,819
a jam on it he goes downstairs and it

196
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:22,899
just clicked to me because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was just</font>

197
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:25,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">so in my face in real life that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uber</font>

198
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:27,939
doesn't sell transportation uber sells

199
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:32,050
us time right and so the reason all this

200
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,509
infrastructure matters in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nap culture</font>

201
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:36,819
is it's just seamless there's less

202
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:39,309
friction that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred and thirty</font>

203
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:41,830
second matters those two seconds matter

204
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,649
right this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most important</font>

205
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:46,330
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this what matters when you</font>

206
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,129
start integrating these pumps these

207
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:49,899
pipes excuse me and let these apps speak

208
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:52,330
together is just it brings us value and

209
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,459
it brings us value in the place where it

210
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:56,409
really matters to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us which is time and</font>

211
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,659
time is the asset it's why I'm so

212
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:00,459

00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:43,059
hate when i asked show of hands and

00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,100
people head nod it's super basic show of

233
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,560

235
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:53,769
pissed off

236
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:58,179
when another human being calls them

237
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:01,420
raise<font color="#CCCCCC"> your hand raise it high just hold</font>

238
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,800
it for a second people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> front row on</font>

239
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you look at what I'm looking at</font>

240
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:08,439
just look at this just hold it high 75

241
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:10,689
to 80 percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room is actually</font>

242
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:14,350
now mad when another human being calls

243
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,379
them and it's based on one thing which

244
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:18,579
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I asked this question three</font>

245
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:20,049
years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room would have raised</font>

246
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:21,459
their hand at a ten to fifteen percent

247
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:23,470
clip I've watched this number explode

248
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,629
over the last 36 months the reason that

249
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:28,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">is is because you value time so much you</font>

250
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,730
are so angry at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your best friend or your</font>

251
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,850
mom for calling you because you

252
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,519
recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that person is hitting you up</font>

253
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,730
on your time that they're stealing your

254
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,829
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you now have technology where</font>

255
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:43,720
they should have texted you or emailed

256
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,549
you and you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to them when</font>

257
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:48,269
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time it is the asset</font>

258
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:50,949
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will play out amongst</font>

259
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:53,829
this mobile execution app ecosystem is

260
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:56,170
predicated on that everything and that

261
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the opportunity at hand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is why</font>

262
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:00,639
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work and it's the</font>

263
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:02,910
combination of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our disproportionate</font>

264
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,160
enormous value in time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that</font>

265
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,869
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the place where all of our</font>

266
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:10,420
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one plus one equals three</font>

267
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,699
there's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> else everything else to</font>

268
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:14,319
everybody talks<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is just minor</font>

269
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:16,480
details in the scheme event and what you

270
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to be reverse engineering and</font>

271
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:19,629
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and strategizing in this</font>

272
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:20,889
room for<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever the you want to</font>

273
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:22,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen is predicated on those two</font>

274
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:26,939
pillars period end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of story thank you</font>

275
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,839
how much time two minutes five nice I'd

276
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,999
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do QA because that was really Oh</font>

277
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:38,619
two examples of companies doing it right

278
00:10:38,619 --> 00:10:44,290
in time or two snapchats winning

279
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,579
attention right let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

280
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,490
snapchat everyone's like why did this is

281
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,319
where sucks is so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> smarter than</font>

282
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:52,720
everybody else he<font color="#E5E5E5"> always has for the</font>

283
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,860
last seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> years run his company</font>

284
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,860
predicated on attention arbitrage it's

285
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,720
why I bought Instagram when for pride

286
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,939
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> 500 days for a billion dollars I</font>

287
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:02,679
grew stole it we all know it

288
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,720
right now right when he<font color="#CCCCCC"> offered three</font>

289
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,490
billion for snapchat everyone's

290
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,540
like what the

291
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,009
he's gonna steal this could<font color="#E5E5E5"> you imagine</font>

292
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:10,509
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were sitting in a world right this</font>

293
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:12,399
second we're facebook on Facebook

294
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,779
Instagram and snapchat they would

295
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:15,790
literally own the entire ecosystem of

296
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,500
attention for the next 10 years and

297
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,139
layer facebook data on top of that

298
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:21,850
attention and literally be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire</font>

299
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,339
advertising industry in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years like</font>

300
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:27,069
scary so snapchats winning

301
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:29,019
attention for all the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

302
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:30,339
doing right<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things they</font>

303
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:31,990
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> done yet they have attention a</font>

304
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,750
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and twenty million</font>

305
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,089
people every day live<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that</font>

306
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:38,800
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and so when everyone's</font>

307
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,269
like what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business model what I</font>

308
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:42,190
think you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out eventually</font>

309
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,350
especially when you're raising a good

310
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">rilian dollars at a 16 billion dollar</font>

311
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,269
valuation so I so I think snapchat is

312
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:51,250
stunningly winning the attention raft

313
