1
00:00:00,152 --> 00:00:03,741
- More importantly, when
I come back in September,

2
00:00:03,741 --> 00:00:06,225
we're gonna come with
some real fire on YouTube,

3
00:00:06,225 --> 00:00:07,420
so YouTube, get ready.

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,986
Me and the team are gonna spend this time

5
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:11,842
to really come back with the 4.0 version

6
00:00:11,842 --> 00:00:13,266
of what we're doing here.

7
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:16,554
â™« Me and GaryVee up in the office

8
00:00:16,554 --> 00:00:19,189
â™« Do-rag flappin'
walkin' through corporate

9
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:21,558
â™« Talks about ownership and leverage

10
00:00:21,558 --> 00:00:25,725
â™« 1800 checks and shy out of average

11
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,200
(mellow hip hop music)

12
00:00:42,563 --> 00:00:43,870
- It's very simple at its most binary.

13
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,878
If you actually realize
that you're a media company,

14
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:47,774
and then you do whatever you do,

15
00:00:47,774 --> 00:00:49,848
well then everything else flows.

16
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:52,082
To me, it's about being able to stay alive

17
00:00:52,082 --> 00:00:53,475
to make your media pure

18
00:00:53,475 --> 00:00:55,652
so that you can capitalize on the back end

19
00:00:55,652 --> 00:00:57,669
because you have a much bigger audience.

20
00:00:57,669 --> 00:00:59,101
The people that are selling programs

21
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:00,376
on Instagram and YouTube,

22
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:03,855
they're not on the cover of Forbes.

23
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,833
They're not on CNN.

24
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,954
These things matter, brand.

25
00:01:07,954 --> 00:01:12,831
Brand is the single reason that
I'll be the guy of this era,

26
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:14,869
and it will be the thing
that I push you towards

27
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:16,052
this entire time.

28
00:01:16,052 --> 00:01:17,897
All the things I preach, patience.

29
00:01:17,897 --> 00:01:19,730
It takes time to build a brand,

30
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,918
but it's the brand part that will matter.

31
00:01:21,918 --> 00:01:23,501
And it's understanding the following,

32
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:25,752
you will never trick the market.

33
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,850
- Let me ask you this.

34
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,474
How many people in the course of your day,

35
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:29,979
as you're providing content,

36
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:32,576
will ultimately bring
that to the web for you?

37
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:33,778
- My team now?
- Yeah.

38
00:01:33,778 --> 00:01:35,002
- 15.
15?

39
00:01:35,002 --> 00:01:36,242
- But here's the good news.

40
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:37,939
24 months ago, one.

41
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:40,145
One thing that we've
all stepped into shit in

42
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:42,725
is every nine year old can do it all.

43
00:01:42,725 --> 00:01:44,296
- [Man In Plaid] Dude. (laughs)

44
00:01:44,296 --> 00:01:46,237
- There's literally two
24 year olds right now

45
00:01:46,237 --> 00:01:48,123
who don't get to do what they wanna do.

46
00:01:48,123 --> 00:01:49,500
These kids believe, and especially,

47
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,110
it's one thing about what
Shoots does and what I do,

48
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,442
that's different.

49
00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:54,370
That's traditional.

50
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,887
But the actual creation,
distribution, and editing?

51
00:01:56,887 --> 00:01:59,102
Nine out of 10 times the 23 year old's

52
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:00,523
better than 34 year old

53
00:02:00,523 --> 00:02:03,266
because they're more native and have,

54
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:06,148
Iris, how long have you been
doin' your thing with video?

55
00:02:06,148 --> 00:02:08,056
- [Iris] I started my YouTube in college,

56
00:02:08,056 --> 00:02:10,501
second year of college, and
I just graduated last year.

57
00:02:10,502 --> 00:02:12,125
- Right, they come with four--

58
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,542
Right?
- Whatever, look, I'm sure--

59
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:14,439
- You know what I mean?

60
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,562
There's people who've been
doing it since they were nine.

61
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:21,426
I view editing and production
and engineering and creation

62
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:25,455
far more like the NBA where
if you're good enough at 18,

63
00:02:25,455 --> 00:02:26,495
you're just good enough.

64
00:02:26,495 --> 00:02:27,721
It's a talent.

65
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:31,348
I prefer you hire it as your overhead

66
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:35,154
because my intuition is
you'll be more successful.

67
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:37,454
- Is there a place on the internet--

68
00:02:37,454 --> 00:02:39,120
- [Gary] To find these people?

69
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,881
- No, where a person can
publish the equivalent

70
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:46,048
of an episodic reality show not
through an existing Netflix?

71
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:48,735
So say I had an idea for a program.

72
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:49,568
- I do that.

73
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:50,401
I do that.

74
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:51,234
- [Man In Plaid] 30-minute shows.

75
00:02:51,234 --> 00:02:52,398
- Have you ever seen DailyVee?

76
00:02:52,398 --> 00:02:53,231
- [Man In Plaid] Yes.

77
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:54,086
- That's what I do.

78
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:55,617
That's what this is right now.

79
00:02:55,617 --> 00:02:56,450
- [Man In Plaid] Right.

80
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,647
- It's called Facebook and YouTube.

81
00:02:57,647 --> 00:02:59,169
- [Man In Khaki Pants] You're on it.

82
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:00,785
(laughter)

83
00:03:00,785 --> 00:03:01,782
- [Gary] You're on it.

84
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:02,615
You're really on it.

85
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,844
Listen, I'm only on a different level

86
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:05,361
because I did exactly what you just said.

87
00:03:05,361 --> 00:03:09,025
Instead of begging Netflix
and Hulu and Amazon and ABC,

88
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:12,795
I just went to the consumer at scale.

89
00:03:12,795 --> 00:03:14,791
It's called Facebook and YouTube, man.

90
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:15,986
Apple came to me.

91
00:03:15,986 --> 00:03:18,156
To do it the right way, it's all marathon.

92
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,233
To do it the wrong way, it's sprint,

93
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,784
and that's why, you know.

94
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,227
If you can leave here with knowing

95
00:03:23,227 --> 00:03:24,601
that you're a media company,

96
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:25,973
and your behavior should map towards it

97
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,135
and you separate and don't have pregnant

98
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:31,756
the sales and branding, and you
can create that environment,

99
00:03:31,756 --> 00:03:33,844
then you've got something.

100
00:03:33,844 --> 00:03:38,498
Shoot for the moon because if
you land at the clouds, cool.

101
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:39,938
If you shoot for the clouds,

102
00:03:39,938 --> 00:03:41,429
you're going to be at the top of a tree.

103
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,096
(buoyant music)

104
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:48,366
- Thanks, man.

105
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:50,780
- See you guys later, enjoy.

106
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,905
The themes of the day of
the last week really impacts

107
00:03:54,905 --> 00:03:58,033
all of us, actually
that's why we're all here.

108
00:03:58,033 --> 00:03:59,672
We have to get out of the business

109
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,810
of having brains doing brawn.

110
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,564
Listen, I'm going to
say something right now.

111
00:04:03,564 --> 00:04:04,826
I'm going away for three weeks.

112
00:04:04,826 --> 00:04:07,050
I've been on fire for the last two months.

113
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,471
You got a lot to do, but please can we,

114
00:04:10,471 --> 00:04:13,171
like Tyler, I don't give
a fuck, like watch shit.

115
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:15,244
- Well that's why, it's gonna be good.

116
00:04:15,244 --> 00:04:17,434
So our next three weeks is
basically what we're doing,

117
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:18,421
this DailyVee season thing.

118
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:20,786
So next week is season one recap,

119
00:04:20,786 --> 00:04:22,981
which is like one through 91,

120
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:25,487
which Ellie already went
all the way through.

121
00:04:25,487 --> 00:04:26,990
So there's not going to
be as much gold there,

122
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,383
but we're going to replay it out.

123
00:04:28,383 --> 00:04:30,083
She's halfway through season two,

124
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,645
and all of season three has
never even been re-looked at.

125
00:04:32,645 --> 00:04:35,154
And so my biggest
difficulty this whole time,

126
00:04:35,154 --> 00:04:37,408
it's always been the biggest
problem for like two years,

127
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:39,693
but I don't know what I don't
know and I'm just keep going

128
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:43,510
versus having these people
have access to this footage.

129
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,811
- The other thing is we
could make so much gold.

130
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:48,087
Do you know how cool it
would be for me just for fun,

131
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,529
I want to make some
ha-ha throw away content,

132
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:53,822
like 7 1/2 hours of me taking selfies.

133
00:04:53,822 --> 00:04:56,412
I like hacking culture.

134
00:04:56,412 --> 00:05:00,568
Let's put up a 7 1/2-hour video,
7 1/2 hours with every song

135
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:04,209
we've ever used on DailyVee,
of me just taking selfies.

136
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:07,319
And I don't care if anybody watches that.

137
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,891
Nobody wants to watch that.

138
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,894
I just want it to exist.

139
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:15,323
Things like that where it's
more like just branding, ha-ha

140
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:16,536
like hacking.

141
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:19,017
Here's why what I just said was super good

142
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:20,844
and what has to be our culture.

143
00:05:20,844 --> 00:05:22,077
Okay, so there's that.

144
00:05:22,077 --> 00:05:23,213
Eric hates it.

145
00:05:23,213 --> 00:05:24,478
I'm whatever.

146
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:25,870
But here's what's funny.

147
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,480
Me even thinking Eric hates
it makes me then react,

148
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,514
so then I go hmm okay, how
do I make this more valuable?

149
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:32,419
Aha!

150
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:35,681
I'm going to get HarperCollins
to release the audio

151
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:38,530
of The Thank You Economy for
free, and I'm going to put it

152
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:43,454
on the back of 7 1/2 hours
of fucking me taking selfies.

153
00:05:43,454 --> 00:05:45,397
And now I'm like, hey gang.

154
00:05:45,397 --> 00:05:47,286
The Thank You Economy audio.

155
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:48,680
Free, here it is, link.

156
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,230
Oh by the way, I put seven
hours of me taking selfies

157
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,164
with you guys on it.

158
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:53,309
Thank you, you know.

159
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:54,142
Got it?

160
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:54,975
Good idea.

161
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:56,269
There it is.

162
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:57,596
That's how I brainstorm everyone.

163
00:05:57,596 --> 00:06:00,467
I didn't take vacations when
you and I knew each other.

164
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:01,300
There's a very funny --

165
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,177
- Why don't you take the first one?

166
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:04,019
- There's very funny things that happen

167
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:05,398
when I go on vacation.

168
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,551
- [Team Member] Yeah, he
talks to us about work.

169
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:08,824
(laughter)

170
00:06:08,824 --> 00:06:10,637
- I will literally talk to you more--

171
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:11,587
- That's great.

172
00:06:11,587 --> 00:06:12,744
- On the first day.

173
00:06:12,744 --> 00:06:13,708
This week's my parents,

174
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,129
but at home you will hear from me like 80,

175
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:17,947
you see, I talk to you on the weekends.

176
00:06:17,947 --> 00:06:22,041
It's about to get real serious up in here.

177
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,329
- [Team Member] Okay, we're gonna go.

178
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:24,582
- Let's go.

179
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:27,165
(mellow music)

180
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:31,199
- In a different world,
I would probably be

181
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,783
an all-time debate champion.

182
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:35,128
- Oh yeah.

183
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,503
- In a different world, you know?

184
00:06:36,503 --> 00:06:39,831
- You just wait to hear their
M.O., and then counter with--

185
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:41,201
- I'm like karate.

186
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:44,432
I let their force make
them walk into them.

187
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:46,540
Heading down to Long Island City.

188
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,462
YouTube, this is gonna be your first look.

189
00:06:48,462 --> 00:06:51,225
We built a huge studio in Long Island City

190
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:54,298
for all the production
capabilities we want, for video

191
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:57,027
and audio where we'll do
our original podcast series

192
00:06:57,027 --> 00:06:58,723
that we're going to
continue to make for clients

193
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:01,299
and ourselves, where we're doing all sorts

194
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:03,527
of Facebook commercials for our clients.

195
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:05,188
I'm gonna try to hack it.

196
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:07,602
Obviously a lot of times
when I'm going to airports,

197
00:07:07,602 --> 00:07:09,106
it's better for me to be there.

198
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:12,106
So rare footage of me in the subway.

199
00:07:18,283 --> 00:07:19,775
Subway life.

200
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:21,275
Iris, it's crowdy.

201
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,776
(mellow music)

202
00:07:38,048 --> 00:07:38,914
- How's it going?

203
00:07:38,914 --> 00:07:39,747
- Good.

204
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:40,580
- You learning?

205
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,516
- Lots of, lots, lots, lots.

206
00:07:41,516 --> 00:07:43,504
- What are the most unusual things?

207
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,301
How is it different with me?

208
00:07:46,301 --> 00:07:48,786
- Five-minute meetings.

209
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:49,792
Back-to-back.
- It's unusual.

210
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,625
- Yes, and the energy.

211
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:53,377
- Hey!

212
00:07:53,377 --> 00:07:54,230
- What's up man?

213
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,063
- How's it going, brother?

214
00:07:55,063 --> 00:07:55,917
- Good, brother, how are you?

215
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:57,194
- Good.

216
00:07:57,194 --> 00:07:59,742
- You know what I love it?

217
00:07:59,742 --> 00:08:01,109
Because I feel like--

218
00:08:01,109 --> 00:08:02,304
- I wanna be just like you.

219
00:08:02,304 --> 00:08:03,137
- Oh my God.

220
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:04,984
And I like, the energy that you,

221
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,901
the vibe, good positive everything.

222
00:08:08,742 --> 00:08:10,150
- Honey over vinegar.

223
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,983
- Yes.

224
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:15,949
(laughter)

225
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:18,616
(hip hop music)

226
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:28,576
â™« They don't wanna see you win

227
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,206
â™« Put you down and keep you in

228
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:31,530
â™« Put you down and keep you in

229
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,480
- How's everything?

230
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,143
- I'm excited.

231
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:35,283
Hey, hey.

232
00:08:35,283 --> 00:08:37,246
â™« Flex and say say I did it

233
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:40,634
â™« Yeah, don't wanna see you win

234
00:08:40,634 --> 00:08:43,701
â™« Put you down and keep you in

235
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:46,981
â™« I been workin' for a minute girl

236
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:49,828
â™« So I can flex and say I did it

237
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:51,930
â™« They don't wanna see you win

238
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,141
â™« They don't wanna see you win

239
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:54,542
â™« They don't wanna see you win

240
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:55,994
â™« They don't wanna see you win

241
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,853
â™« They don't wanna see you win

242
00:08:57,853 --> 00:08:59,181
â™« They don't wanna see you win

243
00:08:59,181 --> 00:09:00,720
â™« They don't wanna see you win

244
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,705
â™« They don't wanna see you win

245
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:07,256
â™« Met her on the west side

246
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,411
- What's up?

247
00:09:08,411 --> 00:09:10,056
- Life is good, boys.

248
00:09:10,056 --> 00:09:11,377
- How you doing?
- How are you guys?

249
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:12,267
- Doing well.

250
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:16,196
I mean, one big question I
have, and it's almost like

251
00:09:16,196 --> 00:09:17,369
don't want to put you on the spot, but--

252
00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:19,024
- I'm comfortable on the spot.

253
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:23,047
- (laughs) VaynerSports isn't
about collecting contracts.

254
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:23,880
Okay, it's just not.

255
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,455
It's about completely full service

256
00:09:25,455 --> 00:09:27,339
and honestly being true to it.

257
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:28,172
- Yes.

258
00:09:28,172 --> 00:09:30,894
- To do that, you almost need to blow up

259
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:33,271
the client-to-staff ratio that's currently

260
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:35,688
in place in the agency space.

261
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:40,080
So what's your plan to growth hack that?

262
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,625
How are you going to get
around the status quo?

263
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:47,442
- By not caring about
how much money we make.

264
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:50,760
- So it's that extra long term.

265
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,082
That's like what we were
talking about with Tyler.

266
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:58,847
Right now guys will leave to
go because they see the chains.

267
00:09:58,847 --> 00:09:59,680
They see the cars.

268
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,440
But if they're really
thinking what's best for me.

269
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,576
- You guys know this with consuming

270
00:10:05,576 --> 00:10:08,966
whatever level of content
you consumed with me.

271
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:11,412
I'm giving people the blueprint.

272
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:14,451
I just don't think they have
the skills to execute it.

273
00:10:14,451 --> 00:10:16,072
I'm showing people what to do,

274
00:10:16,072 --> 00:10:18,149
how to think about it, what works.

275
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:20,399
People aren't built for it.

276
00:10:22,027 --> 00:10:24,212
Alpha male, 22 years old,

277
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:25,285
Hey, bro.

278
00:10:25,285 --> 00:10:27,137
Eat shit for a decade.

279
00:10:27,137 --> 00:10:29,803
And don't enjoy all the alpha bro things

280
00:10:29,803 --> 00:10:33,499
that come along with being
an alpha male from 22 to 32.

281
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,869
How many dudes signing up? (clicks tongue)

282
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:36,702
- Zero.

283
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,182
- I don't think people understand

284
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:40,940
what we're about to do in that world.

285
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,273
You get to see it firsthand.

286
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:46,934
You'll be just like the people

287
00:10:46,934 --> 00:10:48,747
that were at Vayner seven years ago.

288
00:10:48,747 --> 00:10:52,571
When you're in a big nice
fancy VaynerSports office,

289
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:55,499
you'll be like, "No, no,
we started in VaynerMedia.

290
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:56,921
"People didn't even know.

291
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:58,441
"We sat by Iris."

292
00:10:58,441 --> 00:10:59,404
You know what I mean?

293
00:10:59,404 --> 00:11:00,867
- There were six of us in
a row bumping shoulders

294
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:01,700
with Danny.

295
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,759
- Yep.
- Yep.

296
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:05,381
And now they have Payton Manning

297
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:06,886
and Tom Brady and Michael Jordan.

298
00:11:06,886 --> 00:11:07,780
Right?

299
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,593
That's what's gonna happen.

300
00:11:09,593 --> 00:11:11,615
It's a foregone conclusion.

301
00:11:11,615 --> 00:11:12,715
As long as A.J. Knight's still healthy

302
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:14,966
it's just what's going to happen.

303
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,168
It's because of the balance

304
00:11:17,168 --> 00:11:20,737
between the talent and the patience.

305
00:11:20,737 --> 00:11:24,570
If you're actually great
and you're actually patient,

306
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,203
you become fundamentally unbeatable.

307
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:28,751
Did you see that moment,
I'm sure you guys watched

308
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:30,001
USC Talk right?

309
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:33,466
The best moment of that
whole talk is when I'm like

310
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:35,152
this is the best, most
you can ever have it.

311
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,077
Gratitude, it's just gratitude.

312
00:11:37,077 --> 00:11:39,795
One life, one at bat, one time.

313
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:42,250
I just don't want to see
that regret in my eyes

314
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,117
that I see in so many,
and that's why it's so fun

315
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:47,468
for me to come and talk to you now.

316
00:11:47,468 --> 00:11:50,249
Because it's like, straight
up, for 90% of you,

317
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:52,451
this is the greatest era
of your life right now.

318
00:11:52,451 --> 00:11:53,889
That's just the truth.

319
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:55,437
You can be mad at me.

320
00:11:55,437 --> 00:11:56,663
You can be sad at me.

321
00:11:56,663 --> 00:11:57,806
You can think I'm stupid.

322
00:11:57,806 --> 00:11:59,467
I'm telling you straight
to your fucking faces,

323
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:01,214
for 80 to 90% of you this is it.

324
00:12:01,214 --> 00:12:02,829
This is the fucking pinnacle,

325
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:05,856
so you better squeeze the
fuck out of this thing.

326
00:12:05,856 --> 00:12:09,420
Because if you're smart and
you do, then it won't be.

327
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,906
That was such a fuck you moment.

328
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:12,437
- The guy to your left--

329
00:12:12,437 --> 00:12:13,270
- Laughed.

330
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,497
- [Man] They're like,
"You're right." (laughs)

331
00:12:14,497 --> 00:12:18,880
- Whether they think I'm right
or they thought, "Fuck you,"

332
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,494
I'm still gonna be right.

333
00:12:20,494 --> 00:12:21,327
- Makes sense.

334
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:23,002
- But it's all about the kid.

335
00:12:23,002 --> 00:12:24,287
It's all about the CEO.

336
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:26,921
It's all about the quarterback.

337
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:29,932
It's about saying yes for everybody

338
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:32,599
and accepting no from everybody.

339
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:34,869
Yeah that's a good spot.

340
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:36,232
I just think everybody's gonna say yes

341
00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:37,390
when I pitch them something.

342
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,173
But I'm super cool when 90% say no.

343
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:43,073
And I make my bread on
the 10 that say yes.

344
00:12:43,073 --> 00:12:45,582
And then I stick it to
the people that said no.

345
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:47,276
I'll never be too fancy.

346
00:12:47,276 --> 00:12:48,297
I just can't.

347
00:12:48,297 --> 00:12:50,374
It's not in me.

348
00:12:50,374 --> 00:12:51,801
I can't sell out.

349
00:12:51,801 --> 00:12:53,542
It's just not in me.

350
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:55,191
- I guess it goes back to just the balance

351
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,360
of the jockey versus the horse

352
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,229
and so you're gonna go
with the jockey every time.

353
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:03,975
- One thing I will tell you
is if in three years from now

354
00:13:03,975 --> 00:13:07,865
the number one rated quarterback
is begging me to take him,

355
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:09,931
and he's a douchebag,
we're not taking him.

356
00:13:09,931 --> 00:13:11,813
So there's that.

357
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:15,690
On the flip side, if I
fall in love with a punter

358
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,007
in nine years, we'll go.

359
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:20,154
So it's, got it?
- Yeah.

360
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:21,789
- It's more about the human.

361
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:23,352
- What type of agent are
you going to be looking for

362
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:26,012
at VaynerSports say in eight years?

363
00:13:26,012 --> 00:13:27,095
- I don't know, I don't know.

364
00:13:27,095 --> 00:13:28,878
I don't know enough yet.

365
00:13:28,878 --> 00:13:29,922
I'm still tasting.

366
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:31,609
I'll be able to really answer
that in two or three years,

367
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:32,853
just not yet.

368
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,511
- What type of qualities do you think

369
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:36,284
that ace needs to have?

370
00:13:36,284 --> 00:13:38,065
- They need to look like
they could be an AJ.

371
00:13:38,065 --> 00:13:39,671
They need to be a fuckin
stone cold assassin

372
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:41,822
but a good human being.

373
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,295
Like just 'cause she can close everybody

374
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:47,378
doesn't mean she can be
a douchebag to everybody.

375
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:49,637
You know what I mean?

376
00:13:49,637 --> 00:13:50,470
- Yeah.

377
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,400
- Just gotta be straight
up fuckin the best winner.

378
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,669
- How much of that do you think's natural?

379
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:56,502
- A lot.

380
00:13:58,843 --> 00:13:59,676
A lot.

381
00:14:01,527 --> 00:14:04,004
- I guess not the good
person part but the--

382
00:14:04,004 --> 00:14:06,837
- Charisma's super hard to create.

383
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,857
To be binarily an
assassin is teachable-ish.

384
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:19,595
I see the confidence in
the people around me grow,

385
00:14:19,595 --> 00:14:21,345
but not to become me.

386
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:27,084
So I think of it like
basketball, actually football,

387
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:28,323
but let's use basketball

388
00:14:28,323 --> 00:14:29,225
because it's a little bit different.

389
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:32,673
I think all four of us could
be better basketball players.

390
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:35,256
I don't think we can be LeBron.

391
00:14:36,117 --> 00:14:37,538
I think if I play
basketball five hours a day

392
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:41,203
starting tomorrow at
41 years old every day

393
00:14:41,203 --> 00:14:43,762
that in two years I can really play.

394
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:45,468
I think my left will fully develop.

395
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,801
I think I'll be really good.

396
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:49,989
And.

397
00:14:51,397 --> 00:14:52,230
A lot.

398
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,043
I think the key for you
guys, all three of you,

399
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:57,547
at this young of an age is to figure out

400
00:14:57,547 --> 00:14:59,501
what were the things that you were given

401
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:01,251
and make them better.

402
00:15:03,952 --> 00:15:08,119
So if you're kind, become the
most kind person of all time.

403
00:15:09,782 --> 00:15:13,615
Betting on strikes,
obsessed with that thesis.

404
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:16,989
Okay cool, YouTube.

405
00:15:16,989 --> 00:15:19,040
Go get more charismatic like me.

406
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,686
You're not gonna do it.

407
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,337
But if you are then fuckin'
triple down on that,

408
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:24,031
but don't be full of shit
and use your charisma

409
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:25,489
as a negative.

410
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:29,477
(alternative rock music)

411
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:31,513
- Thank you so much.
- Take care.

412
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,232
Talk to you soon.
- Good talking to you.

413
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:35,950
- [Jake] Good talking to you as well, man.

414
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:36,783
- Hey, I'm Brian.

415
00:15:36,783 --> 00:15:38,795
- Such a pleasure.
- The pleasure's mine.

416
00:15:38,795 --> 00:15:41,908
(alternative rock music)

417
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:44,818
- I mean it because I think

418
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,601
I'm an all-time unique person.

419
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:47,980
I genuinely believe that.

420
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,813
- I believe that about you.

421
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:51,893
- And honestly I think I used to think it

422
00:15:51,893 --> 00:15:54,762
for different reasons than I do now.

423
00:15:54,762 --> 00:15:57,548
Now I really fucking
believe it. (laughing)

424
00:15:57,548 --> 00:16:00,795
I think I before
intuitively thought maybe.

425
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:02,621
Now it's fuckin' obvious.

426
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:05,995
- Alright so Drew, the person who produced

427
00:16:05,995 --> 00:16:08,743
a bunch of really fuckin' dope music

428
00:16:08,743 --> 00:16:10,194
that I'm sure you would vibe out.

429
00:16:10,194 --> 00:16:11,127
He loves smooth shit.

430
00:16:11,127 --> 00:16:12,497
So his production style you'd love.

431
00:16:12,497 --> 00:16:13,850
He's with all these West Coast artists

432
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,019
that we've messed with,

433
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:19,405
but now he has my favorite
hip hop clothing brand,

434
00:16:19,405 --> 00:16:20,522
and he's just murdering it.

435
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:21,355
- [Drew] Super hip.

436
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,499
- It's right here, 40s and Shorties and...

437
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:25,424
Linking an influencer with him,

438
00:16:25,424 --> 00:16:27,728
I feel like that would almost
make the influencer cooler.

439
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:28,593
(laughter)

440
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:30,704
- You know what I mean?
- Of course.

441
00:16:30,704 --> 00:16:32,638
So when things are happening he's on top.

442
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:33,955
- He's hacking.
- And they move very fast.

443
00:16:33,955 --> 00:16:34,788
- I get it.

444
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:35,621
Tell me about you.

445
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:36,587
Where'd you grow up?

446
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:40,510
- I'm originally from the Bay
area, and then I moved to LA

447
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,858
when I was like 21.

448
00:16:42,858 --> 00:16:44,287
And then from there

449
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,347
I kind of just started everything

450
00:16:46,347 --> 00:16:47,590
that I wanted to do.

451
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,500
- [Gary] What did the
21-year-old you think?

452
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,447
- When I moved to LA?

453
00:16:51,447 --> 00:16:52,280
- [Gary] Yeah.

454
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,298
- Man, that's a lot of competition.

455
00:16:54,298 --> 00:16:55,930
(laughter)

456
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,850
- It's gonna be a rough road.

457
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,941
That's the first thing
that popped in my head,

458
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:02,358
but I knew I wanted it so I just had to--

459
00:17:03,412 --> 00:17:04,377
- [Gary] How old are you now?

460
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:05,324
- I'm 31.

461
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,457
- [Gary] You look good man.

462
00:17:06,457 --> 00:17:07,471
- Thank you.

463
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:08,800
- [Gary] Got good DNA.

464
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,633
(laughter)

465
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:10,733
- He's just in the right mix.

466
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:11,708
- [Gary] I understand.

467
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:12,839
- I guess when you're
talking about influencers,

468
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,497
obviously you're with
a lot of influencers.

469
00:17:14,498 --> 00:17:16,464
What are you trying to do?

470
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:19,118
- The end goal of it is just to have

471
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:23,780
more of just like a
longevity thing and have--

472
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:27,589
- [Gary] Longevity's going
to come at the variable

473
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,645
of how good you are at continuing
to do what you're doing.

474
00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:33,795
Everybody starts off looking like you,

475
00:17:33,795 --> 00:17:35,132
and then they sell out.

476
00:17:35,132 --> 00:17:37,016
And then the streets don't fuck with them.

477
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:37,849
You know that.

478
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,808
- 100%.
- I don't have to explain it.

479
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:44,518
So the good news is, I don't
think influencers are the

480
00:17:44,518 --> 00:17:46,601
vulnerability of, I know.

481
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,528
You know, everything
I've heard, I know you,

482
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,189
I'm just repeating shit you know.

483
00:17:52,189 --> 00:17:53,204
It's just attention.

484
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:55,287
The key is it's my story.

485
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:02,115
The reason I'm never scared
is I'm not gonna sell out.

486
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:04,710
I'm never gonna think
I'm better than anybody.

487
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,685
Thus in the business
world, that's the sell out.

488
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:09,619
Let's get to know each other.

489
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:10,580
- Yeah.
- Real pleasure.

490
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,413
- Appreciate it.

491
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:12,774
- Yeah, keep doing your thing man.

492
00:18:12,774 --> 00:18:14,135
- I will.
- Yeah, cool.

493
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,019
So here's what I would say.

494
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:15,852
How old are you?

495
00:18:15,852 --> 00:18:16,685
- 22.

496
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:18,681
- You should 100% go
in the family business.

497
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,580
- Yeah?
- Let me tell you why.

498
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,211
- Why?
- You'll never regret it.

499
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:23,590
- Okay.
- You don't know how long

500
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,778
your mom and everybody else
is going to be on earth.

501
00:18:25,778 --> 00:18:28,863
You will never regret going
into the family business.

502
00:18:28,863 --> 00:18:31,542
You may completely waste
three years of your life.

503
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:33,216
It's just not that much time.

504
00:18:33,216 --> 00:18:34,496
- Okay, it was nice to meet you.

505
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:35,398
Thank you, Gary.
- Okay, guys.

506
00:18:35,398 --> 00:18:36,835
Before I go back into the city,

507
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:39,193
out here in Long Island
City, which has been amazing,

508
00:18:39,193 --> 00:18:40,378
before I go back into the city,

509
00:18:40,378 --> 00:18:42,651
this is a little bit of my sign off.

510
00:18:42,651 --> 00:18:44,799
As you might have saw in
the article that I wrote,

511
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,632
let's put the URL here.

512
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:47,281
Let's create a little mini URL.

513
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:49,779
Let's link it in the
episode here on YouTube.

514
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:51,294
I'm going off the grid with family now

515
00:18:51,294 --> 00:18:54,340
for the rest of August
right up until Labor Day.

516
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,208
I'm gonna attack it from the
August strategy that I have.

517
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,880
This has been an incredible
journey with you guys so far,

518
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,040
and this is the biggest break I'm taking

519
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,794
since I've been kind of all into my vlog.

520
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:06,332
I just want to thank you for that.

521
00:19:06,332 --> 00:19:11,291
And more importantly when
I come back in September,

522
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,287
we're gonna come with
some real fire on YouTube,

523
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:14,348
so YouTube get ready.

524
00:19:14,348 --> 00:19:16,466
Me and the team are gonna spend this time

525
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:19,408
to really come back with the 4.0 version

526
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,585
