1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,974
- The biggest thing that's
tough when you're young

2
00:00:02,974 --> 00:00:04,810
is reconciling two things.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,800
Reconciling why you see it so clearly,

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,020
and not just saying "we're young."

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,356
And two, understanding
what happens over time.

6
00:00:13,356 --> 00:00:14,489
(electronic music)

7
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:18,572
♪ Me and Gary V up in the office ♪

8
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:20,432
- [Xander] Yeah.

9
00:00:20,432 --> 00:00:21,265
- How you doing, bro?

10
00:00:21,265 --> 00:00:22,098
- [Jace] It's good to see you, man.

11
00:00:22,098 --> 00:00:23,470
I haven't seen, I like,
feel like we've talked

12
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,303
and I haven't seen you in so long.

13
00:00:24,303 --> 00:00:26,090
- [Gary] Dude, the
lines and the hair, man.

14
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,610
I need to really add that to my game.

15
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,443
- [Jace] Oh, you like?

16
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:30,276
Dude, do it.

17
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:31,109
- I love it.

18
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:33,260
I did it in sixth grade.

19
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,093
- [Jace] Yeah, it was a bold move by me--

20
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:34,926
- It's hot right now.

21
00:00:34,926 --> 00:00:37,150
- [Jace] And I feel good about it.

22
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:37,983
- Yeah (laughs)

23
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:38,980
- [Jace] You either love it or hate it.

24
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,813
They either think I'm like--

25
00:00:39,813 --> 00:00:40,646
- It's faded out a little, right?

26
00:00:40,646 --> 00:00:41,479
You did it a couple weeks ago?

27
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,312
- [Jace] Yeah, I did it awhile ago.

28
00:00:42,312 --> 00:00:43,590
- [Xander] He's doing,
like, national TV with it.

29
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,157
- Oh, you did what?

30
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:46,289
(laughs)

31
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:47,122
- It's fortunate.

32
00:00:47,122 --> 00:00:48,071
It's 'cause I'm not allowed to do anything

33
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:49,810
for the show.

34
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,816
Like change my look, so like,
this is the most I can do

35
00:00:51,816 --> 00:00:53,920
to feel like I have control of myself.

36
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,753
- Are you off filming?

37
00:00:54,753 --> 00:00:55,586
You're not filming right now?

38
00:00:55,586 --> 00:00:56,668
- No, we're on hiatus right now.

39
00:00:56,668 --> 00:00:57,501
- Got it.

40
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:58,334
It's awesome, man.

41
00:00:58,334 --> 00:00:59,167
Sit, sit, sit.

42
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:01,170
- I need to introduce you,
this is my business partner,

43
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,660
that's my brother, X.
- I know him.

44
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,493
- [Gary] Hey man, how are you?

45
00:01:03,493 --> 00:01:04,325
- [Jake] I'm with, I meet you with--

46
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:05,414
- [Gary] Yeah, I remember.

47
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:06,410
- [Xander] Xander.

48
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,243
- [Gary] How do you spell it?

49
00:01:07,243 --> 00:01:08,076
- [Xander] X-A-N--

50
00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:08,909
- [Gary] Oh, like my little guy.

51
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,370
- He actually watched your,
when did we watch Gary, dude?

52
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,450
- [Jake] Ah, couple years.

53
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,410
- He showed me you.

54
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,820
So he watched you--

55
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,210
- [Gary] Thanks, brother.

56
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,370
- Three years ago, four years ago?

57
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,203
Something like that.

58
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,070
- [Gary] It's awesome, it's awesome.

59
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,094
So what's cooking?

60
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:22,470
How are things?

61
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,950
- Good, I've been here
for like, a week now.

62
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,000
It's crazy, it's just--

63
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,833
- What are you doing?

64
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,717
- I'm doing press for the show

65
00:01:27,717 --> 00:01:28,790
and the new company that I made.

66
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,341
- The stuff you guys are working on?

67
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:31,267
- Yeah.

68
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:33,670
- And the show airs when?

69
00:01:34,806 --> 00:01:36,350
- January 19th.

70
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,400
- This is season what?

71
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,962
- Four.

72
00:01:38,962 --> 00:01:40,960
And I'm coming out with
an animated show now, too.

73
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,820
- Are you the voice of?

74
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,782
- Yeah.

75
00:01:42,782 --> 00:01:43,615
- That's good.

76
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:44,448
- That's awesome.

77
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,281
- That scales.

78
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:46,480
- Yeah, no, they're trying to,

79
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,240
and then we're fucking with
merchandise and stuff, so--

80
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,073
- So it's clicked.

81
00:01:49,073 --> 00:01:49,906
- That's, yeah, it's clicked--

82
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:50,739
- It's become a franchise.

83
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:52,400
- Yeah, it's become
established a little bit.

84
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,233
- That's cool.

85
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:56,220
- Which is like, hard, with kind of like,

86
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,480
the way that TV is.

87
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,313
We're like, one of the only shows--

88
00:01:58,313 --> 00:01:59,296
- Of course.

89
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,129
- That has that.

90
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:01,480
- So obviously, what I really wanna do

91
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,340
is really help you guys.

92
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,590
Obviously, we've had some interactions

93
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,423
and things of that nature.

94
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:06,380
And obviously, you know, we're in control

95
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,213
of all the cameras here.

96
00:02:07,213 --> 00:02:08,479
So we don't wanna use anything sensitive.

97
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,409
So like, I wanna treat
this like a real meeting.

98
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,243
- Okay, cool.

99
00:02:11,243 --> 00:02:12,900
- Like what can I help you with?

100
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,360
Let's start with that.

101
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:17,220
- Just kind of, I guess advice.

102
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,053
- Yeah.

103
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:18,886
- We're just starting out

104
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:21,420
and we're young and we're trying,

105
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,420
but we don't know--

106
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,000
- Well, what do you want to happen?

107
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,805
- We want this to be a,

108
00:02:25,805 --> 00:02:27,660
we want the company to be the like,

109
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,090
kind of CAA, go-to brand.

110
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,070
Mark like, as far as like, the
way that people think of it,

111
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,260
the way that we kind of produce.

112
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,140
We want, like, to have all
the top kind of influencers

113
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,780
be going to us because of our quality

114
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,120
and because of the way that we--

115
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,158
- As a production company?

116
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:47,532
- It's a, yeah, like a production company.

117
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:48,960
- [Jake] I have a FOUR agency background.

118
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,310
That's why I know AJ.

119
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,570
I'm trying to create, with Jace,

120
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,450
like a comparison in the sense of like,

121
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,370
a celebrity-backed company that, you know,

122
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,880
has a good face to it.

123
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,034
But I want it to be a
little bit more formal,

124
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:02,130
where it's like we're not
all feeding off each other.

125
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,880
It's kind of each client is
managed by the same person,

126
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,730
but you're not dependent on each other.

127
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,290
Meaning I take care of
one client separately

128
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,479
and I take care of the next.

129
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,500
So kind of like a management
style type of company.

130
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,520
- I understand.

131
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,790
But the output isn't management.

132
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,570
The output is production content?

133
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,670
- Yeah, and (mumbles) management, too.

134
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,858
I mean--

135
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:23,691
- [Gary] So you do--

136
00:03:23,691 --> 00:03:25,250
- Traditional managers (mumbles)
handling your acting stuff,

137
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,540
but in reverse, you know, branding work,

138
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,620
I mean, there's a lot
of management type of

139
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,619
an agent type of--

140
00:03:29,619 --> 00:03:31,030
- [Gary] So management.

141
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,030
- Yeah, it's a fact.

142
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,120
I mean, my vision probably
eventually is to become

143
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,100
a formal management company.

144
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,250
- The way we pitch it isn't
like we're management.

145
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,880
I pitch it like we connect
brands with millions of people

146
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,540
using influencers and
we do it the right way,

147
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,290
which is not shoving it in their face.

148
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,360
It's integrating it right, like--

149
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,042
- [Gary] So you're building
a client service business.

150
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:48,875
- Yeah.

151
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,694
- [Jake] But the thing also is--

152
00:03:50,694 --> 00:03:51,527
- [Gary] Go ahead, Xan.

153
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:53,320
- [Jake] The thing is
like, a lot of the clients

154
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,680
already are repped by
multiple other people,

155
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,280
so it's hard for us to
just come in and be like,

156
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,800
yo, yes, like full-service manage you.

157
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,388
So it's definitely--

158
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:03,370
- [Xander] We're not equipped
for full-service management.

159
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,540
- [Xander] But I mean,
it's definitely more

160
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:08,376
the branded content angle.

161
00:04:08,376 --> 00:04:10,300
- [Jake] Another big
difference is that we're going

162
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,180
more after traditional celebrities

163
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,509
as opposed to YouTube, more like,

164
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:17,220
YouTuber slash traditional influencers.

165
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,428
- So your dream scenario would've been

166
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:20,799
the people behind Will
Smith starting a daily vlog?

167
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,966
- [Jace] Yes, exactly.

168
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:25,110
Or finding like, the Madison
Beer when she's younger

169
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,860
and then growing her into what she is now,

170
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,940
the Alexis Ren.

171
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,773
You know what I mean?

172
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:29,606
Do you know who those people are?

173
00:04:29,606 --> 00:04:30,439
- Of course.

174
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,415
- Yeah, so--

175
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:33,100
- I know more about this world
than anybody in the game.

176
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,170
Period, end of story.

177
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,628
I've been there from 2006 to this moment.

178
00:04:36,628 --> 00:04:38,750
- Isn't crazy how it's panned out?

179
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,583
- [Gary] Yeah, of course.

180
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,160
- [Xander] Have you been watching
what he's doing (mumbles)?

181
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,993
- Of course.

182
00:04:41,993 --> 00:04:43,430
- [Xander] I don't know who
his team is, but they're good--

183
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,290
- Juju naturally is good at it.

184
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,831
We've met with Juju from
the VaynerSports (mumbles)

185
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:49,180
- [Jake] A lot of it is like,
a natural instinct, right?

186
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,180
- [Gary] Yeah.

187
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,560
- Well, that's kind of
what I'm getting at,

188
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,830
is it's like, there's a lot of people,

189
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,663
and you're not one of them,

190
00:04:53,663 --> 00:04:55,150
but there's a lot of people
who are like in board meetings

191
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,191
trying to like, theorize
about what the kids,

192
00:04:57,191 --> 00:04:58,630
I'm like, we're in it.

193
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,463
We're there.

194
00:04:59,463 --> 00:05:00,449
- [Gary] I agree.

195
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:01,282
- These are my friends.

196
00:05:01,282 --> 00:05:02,115
- [Gary] So it's very, very, very similar

197
00:05:02,115 --> 00:05:03,430
to what we're doing with VaynerTalent

198
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,130
other than you guys are willing to

199
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,509
do more things than just
produce the content.

200
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,450
- Right.

201
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,283
- Right?

202
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:12,116
- Yeah.

203
00:05:12,116 --> 00:05:13,297
- Do you guys know what we're
doing with VaynerTalent?

204
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:14,130
- [Jake] I'm not familiar.

205
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,650
- So we have, Lindsay, who was just here,

206
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,230
runs a division inside
here called VaynerTalent.

207
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:25,230
So like, Ray Dalio or Michael
Ovitz, who started CAA, or--

208
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,690
- [Jake] And I'm friends with
Arnold Lyer, who is one--

209
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,690
- Right, those are the
two engines behind CAA.

210
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,760
Like, there's people paying
us right now $20,000 a month,

211
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,900
$30,000 a month, to build out,

212
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,730
Serge Ibaka from the NBA,
like, we're wrapping up,

213
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,750
we do a lot of executives.

214
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,874
Like, so we do--

215
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:42,707
- [Jake] Oh, interesting.

216
00:05:42,707 --> 00:05:44,710
- We do, like, I'm living in kind of like,

217
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,657
those two places--

218
00:05:45,657 --> 00:05:46,910
- [Jake] Right.

219
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,270
- Like, you'll be more,
like, the way you pitched it,

220
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,032
you want him to have more of a
life that looks more like me.

221
00:05:52,032 --> 00:05:54,880
He's more of an actual celebrity came up,

222
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,180
but I've gone down.

223
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,590
- [Jake] I think this is
an unprecedented territory

224
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,049
where I'm trying to clone.

225
00:05:59,049 --> 00:06:00,400
You know, he's doing a
whole bunch of campaigns,

226
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,007
doing like a bunch of
videos about anti-bullying

227
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:04,001
with a bunch of different celebrities.

228
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:06,300
Like Kevin O'Leary is doing it with him

229
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,690
and Anthony Scaramucci
trying to build like

230
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,080
a mini series on that.

231
00:06:10,043 --> 00:06:12,180
And both doing TODAY Show with Megyn Kelly

232
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,360
kind of surrounding the dyslexia angle.

233
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,973
I'm really trying to build Jace
out as more of a real person

234
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:17,812
as opposed to being--

235
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:18,645
- Of course.

236
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:19,478
- More inward.

237
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:20,540
'Cause right now, I think the big thing

238
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,373
that I've been seeing is people

239
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:22,970
who don't know Jace know Henry.

240
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:23,803
- Well, of course.

241
00:06:23,803 --> 00:06:24,780
- And I want people to know Jace.

242
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,260
And I think that's where we
can start a (mumbles) executive

243
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,220
and turn it into a business--

244
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,308
- Sure.

245
00:06:30,308 --> 00:06:31,141
- You know, a formal businessman.

246
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,188
Like, it's kind of contradictory

247
00:06:32,188 --> 00:06:34,730
that you wear spandex
and red tights on TV,

248
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,860
and then he's wearing a suit and tie

249
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,672
going on CNBC talking business.

250
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:39,452
I'm trying to kind of create that--

251
00:06:39,452 --> 00:06:40,285
- I understand.

252
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:41,118
- Bridge.

253
00:06:41,118 --> 00:06:43,000
- But the business that you're
trying to build underneath

254
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,382
I understand, so or at least
I'm picking up the pieces.

255
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:47,472
- [Jake] Yeah, but are you trying to go

256
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:49,089
that traditional ABC route?

257
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:52,480
- I'm trying to react to
the reality of my situation

258
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,290
and invest in the things
that make sense, right?

259
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,123
Like what you guys are doing

260
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:57,780
or investing in something
that makes sense,

261
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,984
you know where the world's gonna,

262
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:00,650
the world's flipped, right?

263
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,710
And like, you guys know it, to your point,

264
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,760
'cause you're in it.

265
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,210
I have the big advantage
'cause I wasn't in it

266
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,516
but I knew it, and all my money
was made in investing in it,

267
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:11,030
building around it.

268
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,960
Like, that's what I've done, right?

269
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,555
- It's like when people
ask me, they're like,

270
00:07:14,555 --> 00:07:15,388
where'd you come up with this idea?

271
00:07:15,388 --> 00:07:16,260
I'm like, it was just kind of there.

272
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,720
Like, I didn't come up with it,

273
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,360
I just literally like saw it
and was like, "I'll do that."

274
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,550
- I think the game, the important,

275
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,480
I think the biggest thing that
you'll have to think about,

276
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,670
especially based on you bringing up Ronald

277
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,970
and your background, and the
biggest thing I would tell

278
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,148
all three of you is what they
had that none of us will have

279
00:07:35,148 --> 00:07:37,740
is the human has much more leverage

280
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,070
than they did in the past.

281
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,460
Over the next decade--

282
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,350
- [Jake] Like the individual client?

283
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,720
- Yes, Jace has more leverage every day

284
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,050
and all these people, Madison and Ren.

285
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,610
Because they always did but
they only had three places to go

286
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,610
and they only had eight
places to be put on.

287
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,790
What your vulnerability is is--

288
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,140
- [Jake] Competition.

289
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,370
- But unlimited competition,

290
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,360
and unlimited and less
ways to differentiate.

291
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,570
Every kid is growing up getting it.

292
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,403
- [Jace] Yeah.

293
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,183
- So--

294
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:10,016
- [Xander] But that's what Jace is saying.

295
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:10,849
It's not proprietary,

296
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:11,930
but I feel like it genuinely still is--

297
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,931
- Oh, by the way.

298
00:08:12,931 --> 00:08:16,400
Just by energy, I'm like, oh yeah,

299
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,286
they'll build a 10, 20, 40
million dollar business.

300
00:08:19,286 --> 00:08:20,119
- [Jake] Thanks, man.

301
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,730
- Which is great.

302
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,630
But what you need to realize
is every day that it goes by,

303
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,370
you lose leverage, not gain.

304
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,526
And so as long as you're
strategizing towards that--

305
00:08:28,526 --> 00:08:30,150
- [Jace] Right.

306
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,110
It's just about becoming
the CAA in five years.

307
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,840
- You know what's funny, when
you bring up Madison or Ren,

308
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,347
what's really super interesting,

309
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:39,030
it's actually very interesting.

310
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,340
The moment we had in our meeting

311
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,640
is the most important part of the meeting.

312
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,290
You asking me, "Do you know who they are?"

313
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,250
And me knowing who they
were the day they started

314
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,940
is the danger of your business.

315
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,714
- [Jace] But I asked, you're
the only person above 20

316
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:52,898
who I've asked and know who they are.

317
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:53,731
- I get it, I get it.

318
00:08:53,731 --> 00:08:54,564
- [Xander] But as time ticks--

319
00:08:54,564 --> 00:08:55,900
- That's exactly right.

320
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,440
- [Jace] But we're gonna
grow with it, ideally.

321
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,507
- [Jake] No--

322
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:00,430
- You can't outpace, you're
not gonna outpace it,

323
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,263
which is okay.

324
00:09:01,263 --> 00:09:02,649
- [Jace] But hopefully--

325
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:03,482
- By the way--

326
00:09:03,482 --> 00:09:04,315
- [Jace] But you can hope--

327
00:09:04,315 --> 00:09:05,148
- Correct.

328
00:09:05,148 --> 00:09:07,166
You could adjust to the leverage, right?

329
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,690
- But from my experience in the NBA,

330
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,280
when I worked with my partner
was 27 and considered,

331
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,320
you know, the older
quote unquote presence.

332
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,180
And what I found was the
players relate a lot better,

333
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,830
I'm sure AJ has seen this, too,

334
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,464
to people they can relate to.

335
00:09:17,464 --> 00:09:19,469
- [Gary] But it's not an age thing, right?

336
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:20,302
- Uncomfortability--

337
00:09:20,302 --> 00:09:21,180
- [Gary] But it's not an age thing, right?

338
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,280
So if AJ walked in right
now and we would say,

339
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,920
"AJ, of the 15 people, 9
people that VaynerSports has,

340
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,150
who are they relating to?

341
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,410
Relating to the most?"

342
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,900
He'd say, "You, Gary."

343
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,733
Why?

344
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,220
'Cause it's an understanding.

345
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,800
- But you two are
emulating, trying to like--

346
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,090
- [Gary] Relating, relating,

347
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,612
because I know more about
Will Zan than they do.

348
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:41,529
(men crosstalking)

349
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,260
- [Gary] But like, here's
the punchline, right?

350
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,750
Like, and this is an important
reason I'm bringing this up,

351
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,564
and this is not to be like, I'm cool.

352
00:09:48,564 --> 00:09:50,590
It'll help you.

353
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,630
It's never gonna be about
anything other than knowing.

354
00:09:55,305 --> 00:10:00,240
Like knowing, like I know
No Jumper's podcast matters

355
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,890
whether I'm 15 or 42,

356
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,140
what you need to do is
just always know more.

357
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,330
- [Jake] But you're an anomaly.

358
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,370
- No question.

359
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,370
Why do you think I think you
can build a 40 million thing?

360
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,380
If I was the norm, you
wouldn't build shit.

361
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,140
- Well, that's what I'm saying.

362
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,760
In the NBA world, you
see all these agents.

363
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,460
And I'm sure if somebody's
in the NFL, I know them.

364
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,221
They're 55, 65.

365
00:10:18,221 --> 00:10:19,054
- [Gary] Ugh.

366
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:20,068
- The players think they're weird.

367
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:20,901
The players don't like them.

368
00:10:20,901 --> 00:10:21,950
The question is can they
negotiate a good contract?

369
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:22,850
The answer is yes, but if you come--

370
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,280
- You know what's even, but you know this.

371
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,490
Negotiating the contract,

372
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,792
my eight year old daughter can do it.

373
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:28,625
- [Jace] Bullshit.

374
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,990
You and me are also one of the only people

375
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,040
who's going 100% in on the social.

376
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,530
Like, these people, they have agents

377
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,920
but those agents actually take it second.

378
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,860
- [Gary] No, I totally get it.

379
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,350
- It's like oh, you do social media?

380
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,520
Yeah, we'll do some social media stuff.

381
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,800
But let's focus on this audition.

382
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,010
Let's focus on this meeting--

383
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,927
- [Gary] Of course, 'cause
the economics are there for

384
00:10:42,927 --> 00:10:43,760
(mumbles)

385
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,593
- It's already established.

386
00:10:44,593 --> 00:10:46,810
It's funny how people don't,
like, it seems very simple.

387
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,970
- [Gary] But guess what?

388
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,827
Like, when we bought cryptocurrency
in 2013, nobody got it.

389
00:10:51,827 --> 00:10:52,660
(muffled speaking)

390
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,850
Like, when I bought Twitter and Tumblr,

391
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,550
go, Jake, read it for me.

392
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,340
- [Xander] Hey AJ, I wanted to say thanks

393
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,590
for being our first ever
Uber rider in New York.

394
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,423
- [Gary] Period.

395
00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:06,640
Like, when you're in stuff early

396
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,160
and you see the world
for what it actually is,

397
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,470
you see it for what it actually is.

398
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,030
The bottom line is of course, dude.

399
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,060
The biggest thing that's
tough when you're young

400
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,296
is reconciling two things.

401
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:20,720
Reconciling why you see it so clearly,

402
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,950
and not just saying, "We're young."

403
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,617
And two, understanding
what happens over time.

404
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:27,840
What gets commoditized.

405
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,260
Your knowledge gets commoditized.

406
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,730
More people will know.

407
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,380
People are starting to understand.

408
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,620
Like when Gary V., on the back
of not Entrepreneur magazine

409
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,420
or the Planet of the Apps,
but on the back of Instagram

410
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,860
and thank you, Instagram and--

411
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,876
- [Jake] We have been on
Breakfast Club, by the way.

412
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:47,030
- And YouTube, you know
like, yeah, that stuff.

413
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,760
Like that stuff is everything.

414
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,860
It's trading culture.

415
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,370
The thing that you guys have
to decide as a partnership

416
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,930
is what you, this is the best advice.

417
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,770
The two of you need to start
getting unbelievably real

418
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,860
with each other about how you care about

419
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,500
the next 12 days, 12 weeks,
12 months and 12 years,

420
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,430
because that's the only
thing that matters.

421
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,960
- [Jake] One thing he and I
do have is a pretty open--

422
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,380
- I believe in you, but both of you

423
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,990
are holding certain
things back as you should.

424
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,018
It's human nature.

425
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:17,050
- Not me.

426
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,750
- [Gary] But you know
what subconscious bias is?

427
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,583
- Yeah.

428
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,832
- [Gary] That's what we all do.

429
00:12:21,832 --> 00:12:23,510
- I'm kind of nuts, though.

430
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,990
- [Gary] Respect, but no human's, me too,

431
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,830
but guess what.

432
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,490
But there's still other stuff
and it's about anticipation.

433
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,450
What happens if you fall in
love with a crazy person?

434
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,420
What happens if your mother gets sick?

435
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,600
Like, I'm talking everything.

436
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,150
Not like how good you want
to feel transparently,

437
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,450
like I wanna screw him.

438
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,570
Most people don't want to screw people.

439
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,682
- No, I agree.

440
00:12:41,682 --> 00:12:44,140
Really delve into the nooks and crannies.

441
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,286
- Of course, so like, to me,
I think it's super important

442
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:49,270
for you to think about
that, because here's why.

443
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,780
The business you're starting now

444
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,040
is not gonna be the
business you're gonna be in

445
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,110
in three years, and definitely not six,

446
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,790
and definitely not 10.

447
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:00,470
And the question will become
are you excited about you,

448
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,840
you have the...

449
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,730
You've gravitated
towards loving that game,

450
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,563
which I also love.

451
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:10,990
I can deal with people's
bullshit for the rest of my life.

452
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,770
It's innate to me and that's
what doing human stuff with.

453
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,020
- [Jace] What do you mean
other people's bullshit?

454
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,500
- Well, if you get into
anything that looks like CAA

455
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,100
or William Morris or the
stuff you've been doing,

456
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,278
or the NBA or VaynerSports--

457
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:22,111
- [Jace] Yeah.

458
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:23,464
- You're in the people business.

459
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:25,770
Cool, it sounds great
right now, but when you're,

460
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,490
even if you get to the
greatest holy grail tomorrow

461
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,690
being the exclusive social
media content provider

462
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,350
and manager of Beyonce,

463
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,684
you're in the Beyonce's
personality business.

464
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:36,517
- [Jake] Yeah, mhm.

465
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:38,580
So I also started in sales business.

466
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,291
- [Gary] Of course you are.

467
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,164
Of course, but the product--

468
00:13:43,164 --> 00:13:44,840
- He's the salesman.

469
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,673
- [Gary] Of course.

470
00:13:45,673 --> 00:13:46,670
- The older agents don't realize that.

471
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,330
They think they're in this
like, super C special,

472
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,822
and I'm just like, you're a sales guy.

473
00:13:50,822 --> 00:13:51,843
You're selling a product to the team--

474
00:13:51,843 --> 00:13:52,676
- [Gary] A hundred percent.

475
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:53,509
- And you have to think
about it like that.

476
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:54,580
- [Gary] Now look, it
takes a certain temperament

477
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,200
and talent to sell human.

478
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,670
The real business for you
guys is these real celebrities

479
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,770
are about to eat so much humility.

480
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,880
And if you can be the
people that tame them,

481
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,080
from going to a pedestal
down to the trenches

482
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,140
to build back up to a pedestal,

483
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,530
it's an incredibly big opportunity.

484
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,427
See what I mean?

485
00:14:12,427 --> 00:14:13,260
- [Jake] Yeah.

486
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,196
- You guys are right, you're right.

487
00:14:14,196 --> 00:14:17,180
Yeah, yeah, it's, look, you know this.

488
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,920
It's proprietory in
your handling of people.

489
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,110
- [Jace] Why do you think
that these celebrities are,

490
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,690
'cause for me, I was always--

491
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,523
- Here's why.

492
00:14:26,523 --> 00:14:27,356
- [Jace] I'm on TV--

493
00:14:27,356 --> 00:14:28,253
- I'll tell you why.

494
00:14:28,253 --> 00:14:29,086
- [Jace] I'm always
terrified of TV going away.

495
00:14:29,086 --> 00:14:29,983
You know what I mean?

496
00:14:29,983 --> 00:14:30,816
- [Jake] The honest thing is--

497
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:31,649
- [Jace] Like why are
they not more afraid?

498
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:32,482
Why are they not thinking?

499
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:35,630
- They're not afraid
'cause they are afraid,

500
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,836
but they have too much ego.

501
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:41,150
The only thing a real
celebrity, not you, a real A--

502
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,320
- [Jace] Yep.

503
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,340
- Not a B or C--

504
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,173
- [Jake] Not you.

505
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:45,006
- Not you.

506
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:45,839
I'm talking a real A.

507
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:46,672
- [Jace] Yeah.

508
00:14:46,672 --> 00:14:47,505
- Like the biggest
celebrities in the world

509
00:14:47,505 --> 00:14:49,140
who are fucking this up, right?

510
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,380
Is that they don't have the
humility to start at zero.

511
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,213
- [Jake] Come back down to earth.

512
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:54,046
- That's right.

513
00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:55,225
When you are a big time celebrity--

514
00:14:55,225 --> 00:14:56,058
- [Jake] Yeah, I get that.

515
00:14:56,058 --> 00:14:56,891
- For the last 10 years,

516
00:14:56,891 --> 00:14:58,170
and you have to start
an Instagram tomorrow

517
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,003
'cause you have to.

518
00:14:59,003 --> 00:14:59,836
- [Jace] Will Smith, Will Smith.

519
00:14:59,836 --> 00:15:01,378
- But Will Smith does have the humility--

520
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:02,411
- [Xander] I know, but I'm saying--

521
00:15:02,411 --> 00:15:03,244
- Which is why he's
gonna fucking dominate.

522
00:15:03,244 --> 00:15:04,294
- [Xander] That's the reason--

523
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:05,370
- He's still hungry.

524
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,650
But a million people I'm
sure we can name right now,

525
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,680
the reason they're not
doing it is they don't like

526
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,780
having 5,000 followers that first day.

527
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,240
- [Jace] 'Cause then it makes them look

528
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,336
like they're nothing.

529
00:15:14,336 --> 00:15:15,436
(X speaks muffledly)

530
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:16,308
They can't take that.

531
00:15:16,308 --> 00:15:17,141
- Of course they need it because--

532
00:15:17,141 --> 00:15:17,974
- [Jake] Why?

533
00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:20,190
- Go read the transition
of radio to television.

534
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,023
Of course they need it.

535
00:15:21,023 --> 00:15:21,856
- [Jake] I know, but some
of them are just like,

536
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:22,890
whatever happens happens.

537
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:23,961
- Oh, listen--

538
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:24,794
- I'm really good friends with (mumbles)

539
00:15:24,794 --> 00:15:27,690
- Brother, brother, brother,
that's a whole different story.

540
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,739
Like if you don't give
a fuck, nothing matters.

541
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:31,010
- [Jake] True.

542
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:31,843
- You know what I mean?

543
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:32,900
- [Jake] I think it's a
lot of the old actors--

544
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,770
- That's fine.

545
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,120
Brother, that's fine.

546
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,061
- [Jake] Oh well, I'm
gonna have enough money

547
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,000
to last me (mumbles)

548
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,364
- A hundred percent, but
you know what kicks in?

549
00:15:38,364 --> 00:15:40,630
Tasting irrelevance.

550
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,400
You know the scariest place
right now is to be a solid B.

551
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,240
Because a solid B is awesome

552
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,140
but it's about to get really not awesome.

553
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,150
It's all the same game, brother.

554
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,810
The same people that you're
talking to that I'm talking to

555
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,520
all see the world the same way.

556
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,020
I think the biggest, so
here's the difference between

557
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,080
where I'm at and where you're at.

558
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,720
And I think it'll be a good
thing for you to debate

559
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,190
on the differences and
decide what that means to you

560
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,960
as you think about the next 50 years.

561
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,960
I have decided to eat shit
and build these non-exciting

562
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,560
EBITDA businesses, like
we're talking right now,

563
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,620
for one reason.

564
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,620
Because I'm gonna buy
PONY or Cracker Jacks

565
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,390
or Captain Crunch, take the energy,

566
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,000
buy something for 288
million, and sell it for 1.7.

567
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,220
I'm gonna do Champion.

568
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,350
What happened to Champion
over the last three years

569
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,914
is what I'm gonna do
one day with something.

570
00:16:27,914 --> 00:16:28,853
- [Jake] Do you know if you're saying

571
00:16:28,853 --> 00:16:30,200
you wanna take a preexisting brand--

572
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,100
- Correct.

573
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,933
- [Jace] You know what I'm doing right now

574
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:36,933
is my brand is as big as it ever has been

575
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,630
and maybe ever will be.

576
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,640
So right now, I know I
wanna do entrepreneurship.

577
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,810
I know I wanna do bigger things, so--

578
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,720
- [Gary] I would--

579
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,553
- Say look, I'm doing this--

580
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:46,044
- [Gary] I would argue it's
the smallest it will ever be--

581
00:16:46,044 --> 00:16:46,877
- [Jace] Look long term--

582
00:16:46,877 --> 00:16:48,540
- If you're ever bought
into where it is right now.

583
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,280
The way you're talking,
so here's what's funny--

584
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,113
- But listen, but listen--

585
00:16:51,113 --> 00:16:52,150
- [Jake] It's a combination

586
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,539
of he doesn't know where he wants--

587
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:55,710
- [Jace] No, no, no, listen, listen.

588
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,820
It's macro, it's the smallest.

589
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,430
I'm saying I could die for
five years, establish myself,

590
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,930
say I've already done this
company, grind, grind, grind

591
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,359
for ten more years, and
then get to another thing.

592
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,425
I just need to use this juice
that I've got to just grow.

593
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:09,637
Do you understand what I'm saying?

594
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:10,470
- [Gary] Two things.

595
00:17:10,471 --> 00:17:11,479
Of course I understand.

596
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:12,311
Two things.

597
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:13,959
That's right, but it will
get exponentially bigger

598
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,150
if you do this thing.

599
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,200
The fact that you're--

600
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,050
- Right, no, I'm not saying
I'm not doing this thing--

601
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,369
- No, no, meaning everything
that you guys are talking about

602
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,369
is exactly, it's gonna just get bigger.

603
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:22,202
Like it's great--

604
00:17:22,203 --> 00:17:23,349
- [Jace] What's gonna just get bigger?

605
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,189
- Your juice.

606
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,030
Like, the bigger you get
on Instagram, Snapchat,

607
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,560
Facebook and podcasting is gonna make you,

608
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,330
as big as Nickelodeon is,

609
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,058
they'll just play off of each other.

610
00:17:34,058 --> 00:17:34,891
(muffled speaking)

611
00:17:34,891 --> 00:17:36,420
It's the reason why I'm
willing to do TV if it's right.

612
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,680
Apple won for me before it started

613
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,630
because it was behind a pay
wall and all this other stuff.

614
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,260
It didn't matter, it just
positioned me differently--

615
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,093
- [Jake] Right.

616
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:45,610
- In a world that I know
is dying, Hollywood,

617
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,060
but it mattered for me in the short term

618
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,560
'cause you're always just
balancing out your gain.

619
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:51,970
- [Xander] Was it about, like,

620
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,290
putting yourself peer to Peer With--

621
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,271
- [Gary] Of course.

622
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:57,920
I won on the day of the announcement.

623
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,960
It just subconsciously put
me on a different place

624
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,793
to the masses.

625
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:03,913
- [Xander] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

626
00:18:03,913 --> 00:18:04,746
- Right?

627
00:18:04,746 --> 00:18:05,579
That's all.

628
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:06,500
- What do you think about,

629
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,350
like the whole celebrity entrepreneurship

630
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,280
that's kind of happening right now?

631
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,220
Like you, I'm not gonna
put you in that same realm,

632
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,604
but Elon Musk and like,
there's this kind of like,

633
00:18:12,604 --> 00:18:13,600
you're just kind of like--

634
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,800
- [Gary] Yeah, it's cycles.

635
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,459
It's cycles, it's cycles.

636
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:18,410
- It's almost like these
people who are creating things

637
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,966
are now the new, almost new celebrities

638
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,500
because of what they've done.

639
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,910
- Brother, do you know how
not famous athletes were

640
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,120
in the thirties and forties?

641
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,990
There was a couple but not collectively.

642
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,870
The NBA Finals in 1983 was on tape delay.

643
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,380
They didn't even show it live.

644
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,040
- Well, what's interesting is now,

645
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,630
but now it's not a money game anymore.

646
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,340
Now it's a what can you do game.

647
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,628
Like Elon Musk, it's like Elon
Musk or some billionaire--

648
00:18:40,628 --> 00:18:43,460
- Hold on, Jake, is it
a money game for you?

649
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,379
Yes.

650
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:45,635
- [Jake] Everything's a money game.

651
00:18:45,635 --> 00:18:47,054
- No, no, no, I mean big, big scale.

652
00:18:47,054 --> 00:18:47,887
Big, big, big.

653
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:49,100
- [Gary] I mean, listen, it
all depends on the person.

654
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,136
Jake could have answered no, by the way.

655
00:18:51,136 --> 00:18:51,969
Let me give you my story.

656
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:52,802
This is just true.

657
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:53,635
- I'm just saying who's
gonna go down in history,

658
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:55,102
the YouTube billionaire or--

659
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:55,935
- [Gary] I get it.

660
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:56,768
- I mean the super
billionaire or the Elon Musk

661
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:57,900
who spent all of his money on Tesla?

662
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,733
Do you know what I'm saying?

663
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:00,410
- Legacy is always different than money.

664
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,250
Nobody who ended up with the
most money is remembered.

665
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,083
- [Jace] That's what I'm saying.

666
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,050
- Yeah, but that's because
everything is being documented.

667
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:08,963
- [Jace] Right.

668
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:09,796
- That's the difference now.

669
00:19:09,796 --> 00:19:10,670
- [Xander] Did you change up your strategy

670
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,503
on that by the way?

671
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:12,336
- What do you mean?

672
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:13,169
- [Xander] The whole, like,
document pre-screening?

673
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:14,280
- Meaning?

674
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,560
- [Xander] Like, that was
what you were pitching

675
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,550
for awhile, right?

676
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,790
- That's my biggest belief.

677
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,190
- [Xander] But you haven't
switched up on that at all.

678
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,480
'Cause haven't you been trying
to do more narrative stuff?

679
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,550
- Like what?

680
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,640
- I don't know, I just
heard you mentioning

681
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,300
you were trying to do, like,

682
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,216
more creative narrative-based stuff.

683
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:30,328
- I just want to make sure I understand.

684
00:19:30,328 --> 00:19:31,610
Maybe the answer is maybe,

685
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,443
I just want to understand the question.

686
00:19:32,443 --> 00:19:34,710
- [Xander] Oh okay, so for
awhile you were pitching like,

687
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,200
I'm not creating, I'm documenting.

688
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,170
- Which is what I'm doing right now.

689
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,877
- [Xander] Yes, but what do you,

690
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,040
do you consider like, the
podcast content documentation

691
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,873
or do you consider that creative--

692
00:19:41,873 --> 00:19:43,281
- No, I consider that creative,

693
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:44,114
but no, I think that's creative,

694
00:19:44,114 --> 00:19:45,150
and by the way,

695
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,530
the first thing I ever did was creative.

696
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,890
Wine Library TV wasn't
gonna be documenting.

697
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,672
I did a wine show for 30 minutes, right?

698
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:50,505
- [Xander] Yeah.

699
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:51,338
- [Jace] What year did you do that?

700
00:19:51,338 --> 00:19:52,171
- 2006.

701
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:53,615
- [Jace] Online?

702
00:19:53,615 --> 00:19:54,448
- [Jake] I have an
interest so (audio drops)

703
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:55,300
reached out to me (mumbles)

704
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,721
A friend of mine,

705
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:59,270
and they want to do a podcast
with Jace on entrepreneurship.

706
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,103
- [Gary] Okay.

707
00:20:00,103 --> 00:20:00,936
- [Jace] What do you think of that?

708
00:20:00,936 --> 00:20:01,850
- He's kind of iffy on it
and I want to get your take.

709
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,730
- Oh, you should definitely do a podcast.

710
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,010
- [Jace] We're not gonna do a
podcast without (audio drops)

711
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,457
- Yes, you should just--

712
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:07,389
- [Jace] So is it worth it?

713
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:12,389
- Yes, I look at audio
as just so important

714
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,840
that you have to be on it.

715
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:16,002
- I think for us, it's a combination.

716
00:20:16,002 --> 00:20:18,106
- I always keep hearing
that audio is the next thing

717
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:19,060
and I don't understand it.

718
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,310
- [Gary] 'Cause it's passive consumption.

719
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,297
It's the same reason Uber worked.

720
00:20:22,297 --> 00:20:23,660
- Like when they're going to sleep

721
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,590
or waking up in the morning,
when they're driving--

722
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,423
- [Gary] When they're driving,

723
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:26,798
they're not fucking
wondering if Henry Danger--

724
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:27,810
- I wasn't sure what was,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah--

725
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,080
- I listened to (mumbles)
podcast every morning

726
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,230
and then, you know, I listen to--

727
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,310
- But how much value--

728
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,360
- [Gary] Let me give you some, amazingly--

729
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,330
- But if you're not paying attention--

730
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,900
- [Gary] No, no, you're half
paying attention to everything.

731
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,810
Like it's all the same,

732
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,439
let me give you a great piece of advice.

733
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:46,140
The written word, audio
and video are gonna be here

734
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,410
long after we're gone,

735
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,422
have been here long before.

736
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:50,520
All of the platforms always matter,

737
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,560
they just go up and
down in their importance

738
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,350
based on technology.

739
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,750
The radio was a hell of a lot
more important than video,

740
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,630
you know, for a moment
there, and then this and that

741
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,760
and so they bounce up and down.

742
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,320
The car radio was super important.

743
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,670
Having a morning talk show
in the car was a monster.

744
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,160
Howard Stern was a monster.

745
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,070
So you've got, it goes up and down.

746
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,530
- [Xander] Do you feel
like, within the past year,

747
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,710
podcasts have just become super saturated?

748
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,070
- Everything gets saturated when it,

749
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,028
do you think influencers
have become super saturated?

750
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,873
It's supply and demand.

751
00:21:19,873 --> 00:21:22,690
The supply is not equal to the demand yet.

752
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,570
And guess what else happens next?

753
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,230
Talent rises to the top.

754
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,063
Do you know how many

755
00:21:28,063 --> 00:21:30,516
social media guru and
businessmen there are?

756
00:21:30,516 --> 00:21:31,349
- [Xander] Yes.

757
00:21:31,349 --> 00:21:32,490
- There's a difference between me and them

758
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,290
because I'm more talented than them.

759
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,880
- That goes for acting, too.

760
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,010
- [Gary] Of course it does.

761
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,570
- There's a double, there's a like--

762
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,000
- [Gary] It goes for everything in life.

763
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,833
The end.

764
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:43,666
- [Xander] Yeah, it's just--

765
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:44,560
- There's nothing else to really say.

766
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,660
- [Jace] It doesn't
matter if you're willing

767
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,493
to stick it out.

768
00:21:46,493 --> 00:21:47,326
- Dude, when I tell you--

769
00:21:47,326 --> 00:21:48,338
- [Jace] It doesn't
matter if you're willing--

770
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:49,171
- You'll love this, as
soon as you're done texting

771
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:50,620
I'll tell you something you're gonna love.

772
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,750
- [Jake] Growing with
a platform or with a--

773
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,860
- Of course, can I tell
you what that's called?

774
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,710
Somebody bought beachfront
property at Malibu

775
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,150
when it first came out.

776
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,110
Some man and woman walked
in and they were like,

777
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,279
"Fuck it, we'll take a chance."

778
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,112
- [Xander] Yeah.

779
00:22:03,112 --> 00:22:06,528
- Now, it's still great,
it's just way more expensive.

780
00:22:06,528 --> 00:22:07,630
(Xander speaks muffledly)

781
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,380
I was on YouTube in 2006.

782
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,920
That was what I gave.

783
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,960
Twitter, I was one of the first people

784
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,070
with a million followers.

785
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,360
That was the foundation.

786
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,640
- I feel like Twitter's got a resurgence

787
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,110
because of politics.

788
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:19,990
I feel like it was
dying there for a second

789
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,900
and now it's kind of--

790
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,689
- [Gary] It all depends
on what you use it for.

791
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:26,040
- But now it's like a main
kind of source for information

792
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,873
about the world.

793
00:22:26,873 --> 00:22:28,680
- [Gary] Yeah, I mean it always was.

794
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,870
It just--

795
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,703
- It just wasn't like--

796
00:22:30,703 --> 00:22:31,790
- [Gary] It's on your mind right now

797
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,760
because of the politics stuff.

798
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,900
Let me tell you this, though.

799
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,509
Fake humility sucks.

800
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:38,043
- 'Cause it's like, you're fake as hell.

801
00:22:38,043 --> 00:22:38,876
- [Gary] It's shit.

802
00:22:38,876 --> 00:22:39,709
- It just comes across like you're bigger.

803
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:41,800
- But the thing is you
suck it up and you do it.

804
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,420
- I do it when I know that
I'm wearing my, your jersey,

805
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,333
and I don't do it when
I'm wearing his jersey.

806
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,696
I play both, which is weird.

807
00:22:49,696 --> 00:22:50,983
- [Xander] So what did you have first?

808
00:22:50,983 --> 00:22:52,150
- [Jace] What jersey did you have first?

809
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,090
- [Xander] Personal brand Gary versus--

810
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,744
- Well I was, nobody
knew who the fuck I was

811
00:22:54,744 --> 00:22:55,790
until I was 34 years old.

812
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,920
So I was a businessman my whole life,

813
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,740
so it wasn't like super hard,
that was my first jersey.

814
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,662
That's what's worked for me.

815
00:22:59,662 --> 00:23:01,100
He's the reverse.

816
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,170
- I could put on a different
jersey at a different time.

817
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,003
Like you--

818
00:23:03,003 --> 00:23:04,560
- [Gary] Yeah, when you
go, look, look, look.

819
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,970
You don't roll up on Fat Joe and be like,

820
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,040
of course you know who I am.

821
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,790
But when you're in a meeting
and you're playing the exec,

822
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,140
but look, by the way,
this is the wrong answer.

823
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,220
Just keep doing what you're doing.

824
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,290
Keep doing what you're doing--

825
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,123
- [Jace] Right, I just--

826
00:23:15,123 --> 00:23:15,956
- And that's it.

827
00:23:15,956 --> 00:23:17,900
And both, by the way, you
guys just had an exchange

828
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,260
that has always been my biggest issue.

829
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,320
You both put, you just have
to both default starting now

830
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,390
'cause you're both alpha
winners and wanna win

831
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,720
into we both, we put--

832
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,900
- [Jake] We do the we.

833
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,150
- No, no, but no, no,
I'm watching you guys.

834
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,150
Listen to me.

835
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,170
This is what I talk about
12 days, 12 months, 12,

836
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,750
I want you guys to win.

837
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,075
I don't give a fuck.

838
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:39,840
You guys do the we at certain times

839
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,940
and you do the, I'll
replay the video tape of

840
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,940
The Breakfast Club
statement two seconds ago.

841
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,070
He just said that's the reason
I can get into (mumbles)

842
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,790
And you said I got you into (mumbles)

843
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,540
Brother, because it's true.

844
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,400
It's true.

845
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,540
- [Jake] Right, both of
your statements are not--

846
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,640
- His brand, they're both true.

847
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,740
And the biggest issue I have
with my other alpha partners

848
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,130
is we both think it was us.

849
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:02,800
I think everything that
VanderSports is gonna do is me.

850
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,300
But it's also AJ.

851
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,133
Like--

852
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:05,966
- [Xander] AJ works his ass off.

853
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:06,799
- Do you know what I mean?

854
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,890
So like, it's just, so you guys will lose

855
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,170
if you don't fight every day for we

856
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:14,424
and understand that truth.

857
00:24:14,424 --> 00:24:15,785
- We're gonna do this, man.

858
00:24:15,785 --> 00:24:19,897
- [Gary] And it's B+, A-.

859
00:24:19,897 --> 00:24:21,140
- Right.

860
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,973
- Got you.

861
00:24:21,973 --> 00:24:22,930
- I'm literally living the life

862
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,080
a couple months ahead of you,

863
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,310
couple years ahead of
you that you're living.

864
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,143
That's all.

865
00:24:27,143 --> 00:24:28,610
That's what being older
is good about, you know?

866
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,962
Like now you're fucking set.

867
00:24:30,962 --> 00:24:32,320
Now you're set.

868
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,153
He's not--

869
00:24:33,153 --> 00:24:33,986
- Do you feel so old?

870
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:35,790
- Yeah, you know, compared to you guys.

871
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,610
I feel young as fuck but you
fuckers are young as shit.

872
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,170
You know, so listen, I'm here for you guys

873
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,160
because I've thought through
some of these things a ton.

874
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,040
How do you scale something,
somebody who doesn't wanna be

875
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,740
not authentic and not like,
there's a very specific reason

876
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,160
that I'm winning this thing
and I know I'm gonna win it

877
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,600
the most out of anybody.

878
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,370
It's because I've been doing
it for a much longer time

879
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,841
than most, and number
two, I care about both.

880
00:25:00,841 --> 00:25:02,818
- Yeah, thanks man, I really
appreciate it, seriously.

881
00:25:02,818 --> 00:25:03,747
- It's really good to see you, bro.

882
00:25:03,747 --> 00:25:04,580
- Thank you.

883
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,413
- Oh, let me take a picture.

884
00:25:05,413 --> 00:25:06,860
Oh, actually, wait a minute,
you got my, wait a minute.

885
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,730
This is the advantage you have.

886
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:08,840
My daughter watches this shit.

887
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,633
I gotta get something good.

888
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:13,233
This is your biggest fuckin' arbitrage.

889
00:25:13,233 --> 00:25:14,220
- [Xander] Can we all
get a picture, though?

890
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,357
- Yeah, of course.

891
00:25:15,357 --> 00:25:17,620
Just say, Mischa, your daddy's the best

892
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,523
or something like that.

893
00:25:18,523 --> 00:25:19,370
- Alright.

894
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,240
What's her name, Mischu?

895
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,790
- Mischa, ready?

896
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,760
- What's up, Mischa?

897
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,020
I'm here, we're hanging out with your dad.

898
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,800
Convince him to come down
to LA, we'll get a set tour

899
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,230
and we'll hang out.

900
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,661
- I promise, Misch.

901
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,320
- We just made a promise.

902
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,471
- I will deliver on it.

903
00:25:31,471 --> 00:25:32,865
Alright, let's take a photo.

904
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,032
- [Woman] One, two, three?

905
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,029
Cool.

906
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:39,160
- Awesome, can you email me that?

907
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,993
- Really appreciate it, man.

908
00:25:39,993 --> 00:25:40,826
- It's good to see you, brother.

909
00:25:40,826 --> 00:25:41,810
- Thanks.

910
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:42,643
- Good to see ya.

911
00:25:42,643 --> 00:25:43,476
- Appreciate it.

912
00:25:43,476 --> 00:25:44,309
- Good to see ya.

913
00:25:44,309 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat hip hop music)
