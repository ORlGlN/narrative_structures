1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,214
(lively music)

2
00:00:06,671 --> 00:00:10,240
(audience applauds)

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,040
- What's up, Dublin?

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,360
(audience cheers)

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,640
(laughs) I'm really
excited to be here.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,240
I have really enjoyed,

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,000
this is, first of all,
actually, back to the reference

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,160
of that, I've done this a lot,
I've been very blessed

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,960
to be able to speak a
whole bunch in the last decade

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,280
and I can tell you that this
is a remarkable execution

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,640
for a first year event,
and so I think we should

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,120
all collectively clap
it up for these fuckers.

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,640
(audience applause)

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,720
Really good.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,440
Think it worked well.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,480
I'm super humbled to be here.

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,920
I really wanna focus
on a couple of things.

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,360
I'm gonna frame up this
talk, I decided just now,

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,240
'cause I like to improv
it up, in clouds and dirt.

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,000
Some of you that pay attention
to me know what the means,

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,959
for the rest of
you I'll explain it.

22
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,280
I think almost all of my
success, and when I talk about

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,600
my success I wanna make sure,
I'll use this opportunity,

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,080
as well, to clear that up.

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,440
It's not about how much money
I make, it's not if I actually

26
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,720
buy the New York Jets, my
football team that I'm trying

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,920
to buy, it's that I just
genuinely wake up every day

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,080
being extremely happy.

29
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,800
I'm an extremely happy guy.

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,200
I think the world is
in a much better place

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,760
than the majority of people.

32
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,520
I think that I'm an optimist,
I think there's enormous

33
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,920
gifts in being optimistic,
I hate cynicism, I think people

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,200
lack perspective, I think
people don't realize the math

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,920
between becoming an actual
human being, when you start

36
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,800
understanding four
hundred trillion to one

37
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,200
is the odds that you're
actually sitting in this seat,

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,240
it's so intense it's hard,
and I'm completely driven

39
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,360
by gratitude, and so
when I think about my success

40
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,080
as a human, living happy
so that I can do my thing,

41
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,800
I think about it
in clouds and dirt.

42
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,920
And I think about it in
clouds and dirt in my success

43
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,680
of being an
entrepreneur, as well.

44
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,240
And when I understood
the diversity of the audience

45
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,000
watching here and
watching in live streaming,

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,320
I thought it was
the right place to go,

47
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,680
because whether you're a
startup founder, or whether

48
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,440
you're an executive or
whether you're an entrepreneur,

49
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,360
or a student, whether you're
18 or 81, the one thing that

50
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,840
has been consistent in success
when I have analyzed it

51
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,320
is this notion of clouds and
dirt, and what I mean by that

52
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,040
is the following.

53
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,240
For example, there's a
lot of marketers in here,

54
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,720
and the reason I believe
that they will not be

55
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,560
macro successful to
their ambitions or their wants

56
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,800
and dreams is because
they're just headline readers.

57
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,520
They're just in 
the clouds, right?

58
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,920
They've read the articles, 
they've read the books,

59
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,640
they've heard those thesises.

60
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,440
They've heard somebody
say Facebook ads don't work,

61
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,400
They've heard somebody
say Facebook ads do work.

62
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,680
They've heard people
say Snapchat doesn't matter

63
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,880
anymore cause Instagram
copied the features.

64
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,240
They talk in theory.
They lack being a practitioner.

65
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,520
Others are in the dirt.
They're 100% practitioners,

66
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,320
They know how everything works,

67
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,360
I think of it, really, in
the same way I think about

68
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,000
marketing overall, which
is branding versus sales.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,400
Some people don't do
anything unless they can do

70
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,920
last touch attribution,
conversion math,

71
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,320
and understand what it's worth.
They laugh at the notion

72
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,240
of doing something like
putting a logo on a stadium

73
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,120
or doing a video
for the sake of video,

74
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,120
because they're just
transactional salespeople,

75
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,880
they're math marketers.

76
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,840
Other people like my
clients, the biggest brands

77
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,800
in the world, go
completely the other way,

78
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,480
they only wanna do branding
a stadium and TV commercials,

79
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,200
and they make up
bullshit metrics and reporting

80
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,480
to justify if
it actually worked.

81
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,840
It's the same
way of being a CEO.

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,320
I'm in the clouds,
I've gotta run the whole thing,

83
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,560
it's $100 million company. 
It's an agency,

84
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,040
800 people, four offices,
it's a lot of work,

85
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,920
I've gotta be up here.

86
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,440
But the thing I pride
myself in, you couldn't imagine

87
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,880
the happiness in my
heart as I stand here knowing

88
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,360
that in the dirt of
practitionership within the

89
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,080
social media environment,
which is where I spend a lot of

90
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,080
my time on right now,
I'm just a better executor

91
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,480
than every
fucking person in here.

92
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,800
And the reason I am is cause
I just devote seven, nine,

93
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,960
14 hours a day to it, I just do.

94
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,160
And the other thing is
I'm not scared, I'm not scared

95
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,040
when there's a new
feature or a new platform.

96
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,400
I don't mind wasting my
time on Marco Polo or Anchor

97
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,160
or Peach or House Party,
because one of them may become

98
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,800
Snapchat or Instagram,
or they may become Vine

99
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,600
or Social Code or Plurk,
it actually doesn't matter

100
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,080
because it actually just
goes right to what's up here

101
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,480
on both sides,
which is the following.

102
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,840
The greatest way to
think about what you're trying

103
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,040
to accomplish is
actually strategy.

104
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,760
The number one thing
that I don't talk about,

105
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,880
even the people
that know me the best,

106
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,360
I rarely talk about the
way I think about strategy.

107
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,760
I elude to it, I do it in
actions, but I don't get here

108
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,880
by accident, I didn't
get here by being funny

109
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,560
or charismatic or
aggressive or cursing,

110
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,520
I did it by work.

111
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,600
One thing I wanna remind
all the young entrepreneurs

112
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,520
in this room is, and
I need to just say this

113
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,400
and I need to say it more
often, especially with the way

114
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,520
so many are rolling,
and I didn't say a word

115
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,600
to the world for 14 years,

116
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,360
I went into my dad's liquor
store, it was a small business,

117
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,360
I grew it from a three to a
$60 million business,

118
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
I worked every day,

119
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,920
every weekend,
for 15 hours a day,

120
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,720
and built a 
$60 million a year business,

121
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,720
and then talked about
how I did it for 13 years

122
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,760
and prior to that moment.

123
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,240
We live in a world right
now where everybody is just

124
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,240
putting things in
their profile and claiming

125
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,240
to be the part.

126
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,000
And that is an absolute
mistake because the winners

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,880
can sniff it out.

128
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,920
You can trick losers.

129
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,760
You can't trick winners.

130
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,040
And not tricking winners
is the biggest vulnerability

131
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,440
that so many young
entrepreneurs have right now.

132
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,240
I wanna explain day
trading attention, it is the one

133
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,960
core move of my career.

134
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,360
When I was six years old and
I tricked my five friends

135
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,560
to stand behind the
lemonade stands, what I did

136
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,280
the whole time was
walk up and down the streets

137
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,600
of New Jersey, sit on
the corner, literally,

138
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,480
I need you to wrap your
head around what I'm saying,

139
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,960
as a six year old child I
thought it was a fun thing to do

140
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,240
to sit for hours at a
time and watch cars drive by

141
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,120
and try to figure out
what tree or telephone post

142
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,840
they would most look at so
I could put a sign up there

143
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,560
for my lemonade.

144
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,720
Basically from the
womb, much like somebody who

145
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,840
had to sing, or like somebody
who had to play football,

146
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,320
I had to follow attention.

147
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,600
When I sold baseball
cards and sports memorabilia

148
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,440
as a 12 and 13-year-old,
I would look at my table

149
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,160
and I would watch how
people would look at it

150
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,880
and I would rearrange
product predicated on

151
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,640
what they would look at.

152
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,240
How many people
here are designers, UI/UX,

153
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,840
raise your hands, anybody?

154
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,640
A couple.

155
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,160
To me, I feel such an
attachment to you guys,

156
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,440
because it's really how
I think about the entire world.

157
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,440
Everything to me
is about attention.

158
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,960
I have no emotion
to the logos down here,

159
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,200
Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat,
Facebook, YouTube, zero,

160
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,560
I'm thrilled whether
it's VR, whether it's AI,

161
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,680
whether it's six other platforms
over the next six years,

162
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,360
I have zero emotion wrapped
up into where I communicate.

163
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,200
What I care about is
where is your attention today,

164
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,120
where is it underpriced,
and where is it overpriced.

165
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Television commercials,
in theory, work.

166
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,760
There's some, there's
probably four people in here

167
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,600
that watch them, right, like
you could get to somebody

168
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,960
with a television commercial.

169
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,600
The problem is
it's historically priced.

170
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,040
It's so overpriced
for the attention.

171
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,320
I could go on
this beautiful building

172
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,560
and do smoke signals.

173
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,840
Somebody inevitably would go
out and look up and see it.

174
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,960
It was probably just
not a good use of my time.

175
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,320
My email open rate in 1996

176
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,880
on WineLibrary.com was 91.1%.

177
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,600
91% of the people on an
e-mail newsletter opened it.

178
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,320
53% of them
clicked Add to Cart button.

179
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,840
That is impossible in a
2017 world 20 years later

180
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,040
because the only thing
that happens with attention,

181
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,200
just so you know,
is there's attention,

182
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,679
and people that
wanna sell to you,

183
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,960
are chasing you
there and they're ruining

184
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,080
the place that you went to.

185
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,280
There's always a new platform,

186
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,000
and it's really
fucking awesome at first.

187
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,039
We love it, right?

188
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,840
No ads, this and that,
and then the ads comes,

189
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,000
and then you all
say, "Oh, fuck Instagram.

190
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,720
"Now that they have ads
I'm gonna go somewhere else."

191
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,120
But you don't.

192
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,320
'Cause you're full of shit.

193
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,240
(audience laughter)

194
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,320
Right?

195
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,680
And then, guys and
gals like me take advantage

196
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,480
of that perfect moment when
it's big enough to matter,

197
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,440
and sell shit, whether that's
to sell a pair of sneakers,

198
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,360
to get you to donate to an NGO,

199
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,640
to get you to vote for me,
whatever it may be.

200
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,560
And we sell you
in that great period

201
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,320
that every
platform has always had,

202
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,680
whether it was
newspaper ads or direct mail,

203
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,480
or television, or Facebook,
Google AdWords for me in 2001.

204
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,640
Guys, I owned the word
wine for five cents a click

205
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,880
before they made it a 10
cent minimum for nine months,

206
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,600
before anybody bid me up.

207
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,440
I built a huge
business on the back of that,

208
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,960
and I had no money.

209
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,640
It was so underpriced
that I took care

210
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,280
of that arbitrage
and I won on it.

211
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,120
And so, what you do,
and this is the number one

212
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,960
piece of advice for
everybody in clouds and dirt,

213
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,360
please make your
strategy around attention.

214
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,400
Nothing else matters.

215
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,400
I don't give a crap
what you do in this room,

216
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,760
you've got to tell me about it

217
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,040
before I do something with it.

218
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,640
And that is our number one job.

219
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,160
I don't care if
you built the greatest

220
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,760
fucking SaaS product
for fucking farmers.

221
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,120
I don't care if your
sneaker is lighter and cooler,

222
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,680
or your coffee tastes better
than anything ever produced.

223
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't care if
you're the funniest

224
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,120
fucking influencer of all time.

225
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,240
Before you prove it,
you need to figure out

226
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,600
where the attention is,
you need to deploy it,

227
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,760
and then it needs to convert.

228
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,080
There is a period and
there is always a period

229
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,000
of one to three years where a
platform has that attention,

230
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,440
and it is grossly underpriced,
and it is your job

231
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,880
in this room, to figure out how

232
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,560
to contextually
story tell within it.

233
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,840
It is not Snapchat,
or Facebook's job

234
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,200
to make a
platform for B2B selling.

235
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,640
It is your job to
figure out how to sell

236
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,920
a B2B product
on those platforms.

237
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,840
Got it?

238
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,000
That's the game.

239
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Period, end of story.

240
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,520
That is the macro strategy
of all things in society,

241
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,200
and basically,
for me, it's all I've got.

242
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,200
I really kind of
suck at most things.

243
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,480
But my ability to really

244
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,320
understand where
the attention is,

245
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,680
and then, 'cause that's
the macro, that's the clouds.

246
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,520
That's the thesis,
that's the strategy.

247
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,640
Chase attention,
and day trade it.

248
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,840
The reason I added day trading,

249
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,400
is I realized, "Holy crap,
this stuff changes

250
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,800
"not year by year.
This changes now day by day."

251
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,640
If I was here seven months ago,

252
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,160
one of the things
I might've brought up

253
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,000
in my improving
right now is that,

254
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,040
"Hey, I'm
worried about Instagram."

255
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,120
You know, Snapchat is
growing older by the second,

256
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,000
Facebook's much
younger than you guys think,

257
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,240
and I'm not sure
where Instagram has a spot

258
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,280
over the next year or two.

259
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,640
Then, Instagram makes
seven feature changes,

260
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,960
all of which Snapchat had,
and now my conversation's

261
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,760
completely different
as many of you,

262
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,080
I can see some
faces that follow me,

263
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,480
I'm more bullish on
Instagram than anything.

264
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,640
And I've no emotion of what my
opinion was seven months ago.

265
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,520
People that make
statements and then think

266
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,520
they have to hold on to it
for the rest of their lives

267
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,440
'cause they made it
are going to lose always.

268
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,120
Especially in a world that's
changing as quickly as this.

269
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,400
And so, for me, it's
all about top line strategy.

270
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,840
And so my top line strategy
nine years ago was this;

271
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,200
That this was going to become

272
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,600
the primary device of our lives.

273
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,440
That not only was it
gonna be the remote control

274
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,920
of our lives, but that
this would become the television

275
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,560
and the television
would become the radio.

276
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,600
And so nine years ago,
I basically committed my life,

277
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,000
to understanding that
this was the television,

278
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,040
and that Facebook,
Twitter, Instagram, YouTube,

279
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,680
were the BBC, and CBS,
and NBC, and CNN, and SkyNet,

280
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,920
and I was gonna figure out how
to make the best shows on it.

281
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,600
Whether that was me.
Whether that was Wine Library.

282
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,320
Whether that was
my clients, and I promise you

283
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,960
that that thesis has worked out,

284
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,800
and I implore everybody
here to start thinking

285
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,040
about their lives
in success, right?

286
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,320
From a clouds
and dirt perspective.

287
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,200
I loved the last presentation.

288
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,640
I barely listen to anything.
I consume no content,

289
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,840
and so much of what I
heard as I was getting ready

290
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,920
was so right and
makes me think a lot

291
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,640
about how I was parented,
and how I want to parent.

292
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,480
My macro clouds
in being a parent

293
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,320
is I want my children
to be as happy as I am.

294
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,560
Because I'm real fucking happy.

295
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,760
(audience laughter)

296
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,000
So that's my clouds,
it's simple. Right?

297
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,320
Most parents tie
their own self-esteem

298
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,200
into their
kids' accomplishments.

299
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,200
That's why they put
stickers of what they did

300
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,920
in school, or what
club they're part of.

301
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,240
I don't care if my
kids wanna be entrepreneurs,

302
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,920
not entrepreneurs,
if my daughter wants

303
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,800
to make
paintings out of tomatoes,

304
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,640
she'll get my support 1,000%.

305
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,480
I want to reverse engineer them.

306
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,040
I want to know what
they want to do, right?

307
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,160
That's my macro.

308
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,560
Then my micro is
the details of that.

309
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,000
The actual
practitionership around that.

310
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,720
Like, how much do
tomatoes cost, right?

311
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,040
Like that.

312
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,840
And I believe 98,
99% of this room plays

313
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,680
in the middle
of clouds and dirt.

314
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,400
I believe that the
market plays in the middle.

315
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,520
A, they don't have
top line strategies

316
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,280
and understand
where the world's going,

317
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,040
and B, they get
fancy and they don't want

318
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,040
to get their hands dirty.

319
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,800
Much like my intro
which I appreciate.

320
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,480
The reason I stopped
and took a selfie

321
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,160
and said hello and shook
hands is who the fuck am I?

322
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,800
Do you know what
kind of feeling it is

323
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,640
to have people
admire what you do?

324
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,280
Do you know how nice it is?

325
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,360
Do you know how nice it is

326
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,600
that someone will
DM you and say, "Hey."

327
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,960
Do you understand
what that feels like?

328
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,560
You have to pull
from opposite directions.

329
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,240
Clouds and dirt.

330
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,040
That's called
really big fucking ego,

331
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,080
and really massive humility.

332
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,800
And that's why people
react so differently to me

333
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,280
because it depends on
what snippet they saw.

334
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,120
'Cause they're
either seeing this,

335
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,240
awesomest dude they've ever met,

336
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,680
or this, fuck that motherfucker.

337
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,960
(audience laughter)

338
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,160
what makes me comfortable,
and what I would implore

339
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,680
all of you to think about,
is the clouds and dirt

340
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,160
about how I think about that.

341
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,680
Which is,
I really don't give a shit

342
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,200
about what any one
of you think about me.

343
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,760
That's over here.

344
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,920
Let me come back over here.

345
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,560
It is insane to
me how much I care

346
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,520
about what every single person
in here thinks about me.

347
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,360
That's literally my life.

348
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,680
I literally macro,
clouds, don't give a fuck.

349
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,200
That's how I've
achieved what I wanted.

350
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,840
Most of you are not
doing what you want to do

351
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,520
with your life
because you're worried

352
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,320
about someone else's opinion.

353
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,000
Normally, 
your fucked up mom,

354
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,640
or your spouse,

355
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,200
or somebody very close to
you is fucking your shit up.

356
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,480
(audience laughter)

357
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,560
Right, so that's awesome
for me, but on the flip side

358
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,560
in the macro of
me not giving a shit

359
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,080
when somebody leaves one comment
on an Instagram post like,

360
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,520
this guy is a scam artist.
I'm like strategizing

361
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,520
how to fix that like
it's the most important thing

362
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,600
that has ever happened to me.

363
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,280
Pulling from opposite directions

364
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,400
is like a bridge, my friends.

365
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,480
It is not something
that you should be scared of.

366
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Way too many people
think it's a contradiction,

367
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,480
think it's a flaw.

368
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,400
When you define what
true intelligence is,

369
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,800
it is holding
opposite things in your head

370
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,320
and allowing them to push.

371
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,240
I love that
everything is easy to me.

372
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,600
We were having fun
beforehand, I'm like,

373
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,960
what's this thing I'm
doing after my keynote,

374
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,400
and they're laughing, they're
like, you didn't read it?

375
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,680
I'm like, I haven't
read shit in 20 years.

376
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,960
I don't need to be
prepared, I stay in my lane.

377
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,760
The reason I love doing
Q&amp;A is if I don't know

378
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,080
the answer to
your question I'll say

379
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,040
I don't know the
answer to your question.

380
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,040
We are fronting, we are
fronting in our society.

381
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,840
You need to triple down,
quadruple down on who you are

382
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,080
and what you know,
and then you can win.

383
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,320
When people ask me
how do I produce content?

384
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,320
One big breakthrough in
my community was when about

385
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,760
six months ago I said, you
know what, we should document

386
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,319
instead of create.

387
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,118
It opened up so much for
so many when they realized,

388
00:17:08,118 --> 00:17:11,919
wait a minute, right,
you need to be documenting

389
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,400
in your stories or in
your vlog about the journey

390
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,560
of becoming an entrepreneur,
not claiming that you're

391
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,640
a 21-year-old life coach,
and pay me $5,000 a month

392
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,480
and I'll teach you how
to fucking live, fuck you.

393
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,680
(audience laughter)

394
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,600
Documenting versus creating.

395
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,320
Your truth is the only
thing that you will ever

396
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,560
successfully sell.

397
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,160
I love when people think sales
people are shitty, right,

398
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,960
and I agree, except
the top one percent.

399
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,160
The reason I've been so
successful is I only sell

400
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,640
stuff I believe in.

401
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,200
Every wine I ever sold,
every thesis I've ever had,

402
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,840
every startup
I ever invested in.

403
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,600
Do you know how fun it
is to sell something you

404
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,920
fundamentally believe in?

405
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,560
Now, here's what comes along
with the clouds and the dirt

406
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,840
of selling something that
you fundamentally believe in.

407
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,800
From a clouds standpoint,
over two, three, four years,

408
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,280
especially if
you're good, you will win.

409
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,960
The world will come to you.

410
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,840
Plenty of people made
fun of me when I started

411
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,640
an e-commerce website in 1996.

412
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,080
Nobody was gonna buy
wine on the internet.

413
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,080
Shit, in 1996, for all you
youngsters who weren't there,

414
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,320
the internet was a
fad, remember that?

415
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,840
People made fun of me
when I did email marketing

416
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,160
instead of
making a wine catalog.

417
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,320
The hell was email?

418
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,040
It's stupid.

419
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,440
People made fun of me
when I started a YouTube show

420
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,360
a couple of months
after YouTube came out.

421
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,400
What was YouTube?

422
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,680
Where will it
be tomorrow, right?

423
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,640
People definitely
made fun of Twitter.

424
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,880
People definitely
made fun of Snapchat.

425
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,240
This is what people do, they
fear, they don't take risks,

426
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,800
and so, when I started talking
about documenting versus

427
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,800
creating, I want to
tell you why I did that

428
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,120
and why I think
it's important for

429
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,200
so many of you in this room.

430
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,040
My friends,
whether you like it or not,

431
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,240
whether it fits your
philosophical point of view

432
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,960
of where the world is,
you are a media company

433
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,480
before you are anything else,

434
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,560
and I mean you as a human being.

435
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,200
That's just the
reality of the marketplace.

436
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,680
I you are able to
understand that and realize that

437
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,080
you are a media company, comma,

438
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,880
you're a SaaS
product for farmers,

439
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,040
you're a media company, comma,

440
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,240
you're a salesperson at
Facebook, you're a media, comma,

441
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,160
you've got this startup.

442
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,880
If you can understand
that it changes everything,

443
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,360
it changes the way that
you think about the world.

444
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,840
If you are not talking in
these platforms, my friends,

445
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,800
this it it.

446
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,600
And by the way, this
would be gone one day, too,

447
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,720
and I can't wait to come here
in seven years and be like,

448
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,160
this, fuck you,
this is over, you suck.

449
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,720
(audience laughter)

450
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,920
But this is it, and if you
are not communicating about

451
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,040
what you're trying to
accomplish effectively here,

452
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,720
and contextually,
differently, in every platform

453
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,120
predicated on how the consumer
thinks about the platform

454
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,320
when they're in it.

455
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,280
AKA, when a woman
is on Pinterest

456
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,320
and has aspiration of
shopping and buying, her mind

457
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,800
is in a different place
than when she is on Facebook

458
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,040
keeping up with her
friends and media companies,

459
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,200
and you have to
storytell differently based on

460
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,960
the mindset, the way
you act and think and work

461
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,320
is very different than
when you go on a girl's trip

462
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,400
for the weekend.

463
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,520
Psychology, 
reverse engineering,

464
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
macro understanding.

465
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,600
This shit isn't
happening by accident.

466
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,040
I didn't make a funny
fucking video and curse twice

467
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,920
and everything
miraculously happened.

468
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,240
Yeah.

469
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,160
(audience laughter)

470
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,160
So it might be time for
me to start putting pressure

471
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,640
on this narrative,
which I enjoy. I like playing

472
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,800
the I'm stupid at everything,
I even did it in this talk.

473
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,600
But I promise you, I'm gonna
end up being way less stupid

474
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,240
than people think
when this is all done.

475
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,960
Because the great
thing about not giving a shit

476
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,160
about what anybody
thinks is very simple.

477
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,320
Let me tell you why
it's very practical for you

478
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,080
to change your
life and start pushing

479
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,240
against that narrative.

480
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,240
One of the two of
you is gonna be right.

481
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,080
Regardless of how you
debate it in your head,

482
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,560
either you're gonna be right
and you're gonna be special

483
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,560
and you're gonna make it,
or your psycho dad is gonna

484
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,680
be right and you're a
lose and you'll never make it

485
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,720
out of this town.

486
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,400
But debating it over
appearance for 30 years

487
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,000
is a fucking waste of time.

488
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,880
What's way more interesting
is to go out and fucking do

489
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,800
and execute and stick it
to people's fucking faces.

490
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,040
Two days ago, and it never
ends, my friends, two days ago

491
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,840
Apple announced it's show,
Planet of the Apps,

492
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,080
it's one of Apple's original
new shows, you can watch it

493
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,240
through Apple Music,
please do, cause I'm in it,

494
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,080
and there's four judges.

495
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,120
World superstar Will.I.Am,
world superstar Jessica Alba,

496
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,000
world superstar Gwyneth Paltrow,
and me.

497
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,680
(audience laughter)

498
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,640
Super cool for me and my family.

499
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,760
Next step in my career,

500
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,440
more top of the line attention,
then they'll google my name,

501
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,440
then they'll go to
launch my stuff, and I'll have

502
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,160
more stuff, and I'll
figure out what to do

503
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,080
with that attention.

504
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,200
But here is the best part I
took away from the announcement.

505
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,680
Lot of articles written
about it, cool, cool, cool,

506
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,200
but one really stood out.

507
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,880
Planet of the Apps is a
new show by Apple with judges

508
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,720
Gwyneth Paltrow, Will.I.Am,
Jessica Alba, and others.

509
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,280
(audience laughter)

510
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,360
- Best day of my life.

511
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,720
(audience laughs)

512
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,440
There is nothing
that makes me happier

513
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,080
than having a
chip on my shoulder.

514
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,240
(audience laughter)

515
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,920
Chips on my shoulder

516
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,200
have been the
bellwether of my career.

517
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,080
First chip was not being able
to speak English in America,

518
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,440
'cause I was an immigrant and

519
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,200
having five and six-year-olds
make fun of you for that.

520
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,920
Great. Love it.
(audience snickers)

521
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:57,560
Next, is to be 4' 11" your
freshman year of high school.

522
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,480
(audience laughter)

523
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,000
Perfect.
(audience laughter)

524
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,560
Next is to get D's
and F's in high school

525
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,640
during the era where
education was at its apex,

526
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,720
and entrepreneurship
was at its low,

527
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,880
and having every teacher
and every friend's parent

528
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,720
say that you wouldn't make it.

529
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,520
Fuckin' perfect.
(audience laughter)

530
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,480
And then going into
your dad's liquor business

531
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,440
and saying that
you're not good enough

532
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,560
so you have to go
into your daddy's store.

533
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,760
Love it.
(audience laughter)

534
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,440
And on and on and on.

535
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,240
And with
everything that I've got,

536
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,640
and everything that I'm at,

537
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,840
still I get categorized as,

538
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,520
"And among others."

539
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,800
(audience snickers)

540
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,040
And I promise you,

541
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,080
that's the way
I always want it to be.

542
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,480
No matter what I achieve,

543
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,760
no matter where I go,

544
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,800
being underestimated
is the greatest gift.

545
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,560
When you can make the mind shift

546
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,120
and actually not care.

547
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,000
When you can make the
mind shift and realize

548
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,160
the debate doesn't matter.

549
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,760
Guys, the debate doesn't matter.

550
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,640
What matters is the end result.

551
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,160
What matters is the
legacy that you leave.

552
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,440
What matters is
don't prove it to me,

553
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,760
don't tell it to
me over social media,

554
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,240
show me.

555
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,080
I love that,

556
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,160
and I love that
we're all so blessed

557
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,760
to be living, and
let me remind you,

558
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,320
because there's a lot of media
that tells you otherwise.

559
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,200
Let me just say it because data,

560
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,280
like the last presentation,
is just a funny thing.

561
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,320
We're living in the greatest era

562
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,160
that any human
has ever lived in.

563
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,480
We need to get grateful.

564
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,160
Is there problems? Fuck yes.

565
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,800
But it's all about alternatives.

566
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,400
You want to be growing up

567
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,680
during the era of
the Black fuckin' Plague?

568
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,520
(audience laughter)

569
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,400
You want that?

570
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,040
You think that's fuckin' fun?

571
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,480
Fuck. Sorry, shit
scares the fuck out of me.

572
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,320
It's all about options.

573
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,520
You don't like your job?

574
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,680
Stop fucking crying
and go get another one.

575
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,040
You're sad that you thought
of Uber before they did it?

576
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,200
Nobody gives a fuck,
everybody thought of it.

577
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,240
(audience laughter)

578
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,440
Everybody's fucking complaining.

579
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,920
Let me end with this, and then
I wanna get into our panel,

580
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,200
which I'm excited for.

581
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,600
Let me just end with this,

582
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,840
because you need to
understand what this means.

583
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,080
Complaining.

584
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,040
There are only
two groups of people

585
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,400
that will listen
to you complain.

586
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,480
The three to four loved ones
that are most closest to you,

587
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,200
and they love you so much

588
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,520
they're willing to
listen to your shit,

589
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,680
(audience laughter)

590
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,000
and group number two,

591
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,320
your other loser friends.

592
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,760
(audience laughter)

593
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,560
Stop fucking complaining.

594
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,640
Thank you.

595
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,320
(audience cheers and applauds)

596
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,960
Thank you.

597
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,680
- Thank you very much.

598
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,720
Okay, I'm not
gonna take up much time,

599
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,360
I'll get out of the
way as quick as possible

600
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,800
because we're gonna pick
up with a panel discussing

601
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,360
much of what Gary
was talking about.

602
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,120
The official title of
the panel discussion is,

603
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,240
"How to Harness the
Power of Global Conversation

604
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,840
"through the Various
Channels Social Media Offers."

605
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,240
I suspect a better term maybe,
a day trading for attention,

606
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,440
as Gary put it.

607
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,600
He's gonna come back out,

608
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,280
he's gonna be
joined by Bruce Daisley,

609
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,520
who is EMEA Vice
President for Twitter,

610
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,800
by Kieran Flanagan,

611
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,280
who's VP of Marketing
for HubSpot,

612
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,640
and the moderator
for the panel discussion

613
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,360
is Ross Kingsland, owns
his own creative agency,

614
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,480
and is a
contributor to FAST Company.

615
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,080
So will you
please welcome back Gary,

616
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,680
and welcome
Bruce, Kieran, and Ross.

617
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,560
(indie rock music)

618
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,160
- Want the middle?

619
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,520
- I'm fine here. Thank you, bro.

620
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,760
Long time.

621
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,000
(audience laughter)

622
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,000
- [Ross] Great. Okay, so--

623
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,520
- Is that your actual voice?

624
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,280
Fuck. (audience
and panel laughs)

625
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,400
Alright, thanks for having us.

626
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
- Came on yesterday.

627
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,480
- Jesus.

628
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,320
(audience and panel laughs)

629
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,240
- Awesome, awesome talk by Gary.

630
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,680
Really, really important.

631
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,160
Very, very true,
particularly with

632
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,160
where we are with
the world at the moment.

633
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,520
And I think it'd
probably be useful

634
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,760
if we can talk and use your
cloud analogy to start up here

635
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,200
and talk about the way that

636
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,120
social media is being influenced

637
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,640
very, very directly by some
very, very powerful people.

638
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,480
From someone who
obviously has interacted

639
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,280
with social media
and how we use it,

640
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,880
I'd just like to start
by, Gary if you go first,

641
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,920
just getting your thoughts on

642
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,800
how a leader,

643
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,360
political or business,
or otherwise,

644
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,760
should start to
engage social media

645
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,520
if they haven't
been on it before.

646
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,640
- Well look, I think there's
a very specific reason that

647
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,960
when somebody
creates a coup d'etat,

648
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,000
and wants to
overthrow a government,

649
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,480
the first place they
historically have gone

650
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,000
is after the TV and
radio and newspaper.

651
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,520
They've gone after the media.

652
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,160
The media is what
controls our thinking.

653
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,400
The internet
itself has arbitraged out

654
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,360
the traditional media channels.

655
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,920
So the way I think about it is,

656
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,240
it's the single most
important thing in the world.

657
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,480
The reason I think social
media's so funny, is as a word,

658
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,680
and I'm sure you guys are
gonna jump in here and agree,

659
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,480
it's amazing how
some people think of it

660
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,520
as this afterthought,
a sprinkle,

661
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,480
a nice to have, a
clever little thing.

662
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,760
It's a slang term for the
current state of communication

663
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,920
in an internet environment.

664
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,280
And when you think
about what that means,

665
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,800
it's very hard
to underestimate it.

666
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,920
And I do believe that whether
it's Brexit or Donald Trump

667
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,280
or things of that nature,

668
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,680
we are now in the beginning
process of the transition

669
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,480
of people not
thinking about this

670
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,160
as a small little thing anymore.

671
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,800
In the last six months,

672
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,040
I have had more propaganda
organizations reach out to me

673
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,880
than I've had
in the last decade.

674
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,120
People that have an agenda
about changing the perception

675
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,760
of an issue on
a political level,

676
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,960
and now want me to navigate it,

677
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,480
and architect it.

678
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,760
And I've stayed away from it

679
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,560
because these
things are hardcore,

680
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,120
but the tide has changed.

681
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,040
- [Bruce] Yeah,
in terms of advice,

682
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,320
what I'd give to
someone getting going,

683
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,840
I think, truly,

684
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,800
the best way to ever take
in the power of social media

685
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,040
and the way that
social media's working

686
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,120
is to listen first.

687
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,480
Sometimes you can be ten-eerd

688
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,320
if you stride forward and
you try and say something,

689
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,240
and that might be
you try and say something

690
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,520
in the midst of a big news story

691
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,080
that's blowing up around you.

692
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,560
So always listening first
is the most powerful thing.

693
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,880
And I think, as Gary says,

694
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,720
over the last six months
everyone's been reminded

695
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,240
that more and more people
are getting their information

696
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,680
from the device
in their pockets.

697
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,800
More and more people
are forming their opinions

698
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,440
based on that,

699
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,640
and so it's never
been more important

700
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,320
for people to understand
the implications of that.

701
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,240
And for marketers,
and for people here,

702
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,520
to try and channel that

703
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,600
for their own
companies' benefits really.

704
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,440
- [Kieran] Yeah, I think
one of the things

705
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,240
I'm fascinated about in terms of

706
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,600
the power of
social at the moment

707
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,600
is like its role in the U.S.,

708
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,560
even like the
political pre-election

709
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,080
and current political system.

710
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,720
And if you read
some of the articles

711
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,360
of how how much news
is distributed today,

712
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,960
and like it's
very difficult to do.

713
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,120
Checks or not, it
shows you how much reliance

714
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,160
people put in the
information they consume

715
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,680
through social channels.

716
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,400
And I think for any business

717
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,840
rather than think
"Do I have to do social?"

718
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,200
what you are
really trying to do is

719
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,080
communicate with people
where they spend their time.

720
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,920
And so for a business
you are trying to understand

721
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,480
where do my
users spend their time?

722
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,320
How can I communicate
in a way that is

723
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,440
part of their day to day life?

724
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,840
Not a part of, like,
that person just going

725
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,680
I hate this brand
because they are stopping me

726
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,320
from doing the
things I actually love.

727
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,920
So I think that's
the way I interpret how

728
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,320
businesses can kind of
leverage those challenges.

729
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,120
- And Bruce,
obviously over at Twitter,

730
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,920
famously you've got,
had some issues with

731
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,320
loss profit warnings
recently and share price.

732
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,160
We talked a little
bit earlier backstage

733
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,960
but you obviously
can't go into too much

734
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,360
detail about that.

735
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,560
But was that
basically as I understand it

736
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,400
through a lack of
advertising spent.

737
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,000
And I wonder what
the implications we're on

738
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
that with a social
media giant such as Twitter,

739
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,560
has it now need to
plateau, as like Gary explains,

740
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,480
as some of the new ones come up,

741
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,560
and just what is
Twitter's thinking on that?

742
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,280
- Yeah I think that's
a good segue actually

743
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,960
from the
previous question because

744
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,720
simultaneously
you're saying social media

745
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,320
and the way we're
consuming news is changing

746
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,280
a pace faster than ever before.

747
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,960
Simultaneously you're saying

748
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,200
actually you might
superficially read stories

749
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,400
that frame our own situation,

750
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,520
Twitter's own situation,

751
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,000
as more
difficult in that context.

752
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,160
And I think actually
that the first is a reminder

753
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,160
that the device in
our pocket, our phones,

754
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,040
are going to be so
fundamental in terms of

755
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,680
how we communicate
and how we connect

756
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,360
with the world.

757
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,760
What we've tried
to do at Twitter,

758
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,960
I think, there's
one mega trend right now

759
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,280
which is this reductive
thinking and people thinking

760
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,600
that a simple answer
is the answer to things.

761
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,320
And I think what
we've done at Twitter is say

762
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,720
for us to achieve
strong user growth,

763
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,560
for us to build
engagement with the product,

764
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,000
that's not a simple
three bullet point list.

765
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,600
So what we've
tried to do is think

766
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,440
okay let's go back to basics.

767
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,920
There's no quick
solution to accelerate

768
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,120
our audience growth.

769
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,240
And we've
changed a hundred things.

770
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,720
And I think the
consequence of that is the,

771
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,920
over the last 12 months, 
each successive quarter

772
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,840
we've seen an acceleration
in our audience growth,

773
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,760
daily audience is
growing probably faster

774
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,600
than any time since our IPO.

775
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,720
And so we're in a position where

776
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,600
there wasn't a simple answer

777
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,920
but we've worked on that.

778
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,560
But I think just a
reminder, you know,

779
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,800
we're in an environment where

780
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,480
it's a very competitive world.

781
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,880
People have got
four or five apps

782
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,880
they use on their phone.

783
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,000
I think 90% of the
time that people spend

784
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,680
is on their top three apps.

785
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,480
So we know massive potential
if we get the product right.

786
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,040
If we make people
realize that time is a

787
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,280
compelling narrative,
there's so much news,

788
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,280
if we make people
realize that Twitter is

789
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,200
an exciting
place to get your news,

790
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,920
then we're in a good position.

791
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,680
- [Ross] Gary.

792
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,920
- [Gary] Yeah, listen.
Twitter... (sighs)

793
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,800
Twitter has a very
deep emotion in my heart, right?

794
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,800
I genuinely feel
comfortable in saying this.

795
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:56,040
As much bravado as I have,
Twitter is a very substantial

796
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,560
reason to why I am
sitting on this stage.

797
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,720
It was the platform
that completely catapulted me

798
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,800
into the tech space.

799
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,720
You know, it's
like my first love.

800
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,760
It's like the first
girl I hooked up with,

801
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,560
it's always
gonna be there, right?

802
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,159
And so, I have a lot of
emotion towards Twitter.

803
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:10,840
I would tell you,

804
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,600
and Dick Costolo
is probably one of my

805
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,360
favorite human beings on Earth,

806
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,719
let alone somebody
that I've met in tech,

807
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,639
I think Twitter is
an amazing story of

808
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,639
complacency on the product side.

809
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,040
It went five years when
it was the number two player,

810
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,840
and there was no
three, four and five,

811
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,159
where they did nothing.

812
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,880
They did nothing
on the product side.

813
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,920
And I agree with you.

814
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,199
I am really excited
about Twitter, not from

815
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,800
Trump using it and that thing,

816
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,840
but from little subtle
changes to the product.

817
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,719
I mean, you know, when
you look at why Snapchat

818
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:44,040
and Instagram both, 
in however you look at it,

819
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,679
have had good years,
good 18 months,

820
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,960
they change their
products all the time.

821
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,880
There's feature
sets all the time.

822
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,120
And so I think Jack's
energy of product changes

823
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,360
is very important.

824
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,120
But I do think that
we should understand

825
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,560
how special Twitter is.

826
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,400
And let me explain
what I mean by that.

827
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,160
As a business, it's not
going to sound as great,

828
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,560
as a utility, it's
going to sound the best.

829
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,400
Twitter is actually, 
actually the only

830
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,400
pure play social
network in the world today,

831
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,320
as it was
defined in the beginning.

832
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,400
It's the only place
where you put out content,

833
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,440
and you consume content,

834
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,840
and you engage with
people at real scale.

835
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,600
If you look at what's going
on with every other platform,

836
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,160
they're content
push out systems.

837
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,640
They're CMSs at scale with some

838
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,080
functionality of
engagement like a blog.

839
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,000
When you look at
Twitter, it is actually

840
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,640
the water cooler of our society.

841
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,760
The problem and
challenge for Twitter is

842
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,680
CMS content push at
scale is good business,

843
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,320
because you're just consuming,

844
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,040
and every fifth time
you consume a commercial.

845
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,320
In the way that people consume

846
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,840
the firehouse of Twitter,
they're not consuming.

847
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,840
Twitter, if you
want ads right now on it,

848
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,480
versus other platforms,
it's just not working

849
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,000
to the math that
Twitter wants it to.

850
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,680
But to their credit,
with some of the

851
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,040
video products,
with some of the stuff,

852
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,200
I'm starting to see an uptick.

853
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,360
And again, much like
the micro conversation

854
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,640
I said of, you know,
I said that Instagram

855
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,600
might be in trouble.

856
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,680
Nothing would
make me happier than

857
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,600
two years from now, wait a
minute, it's about Twitter.

858
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,600
And if you look at 14 to
16 year olds in the U.S.,

859
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,440
there's a huge
spike of Twitter growth.

860
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,600
So that's intriguing.

861
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,920
But I think there's a
lot of feature changes

862
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,440
a lot of shifts,
but I will say this.

863
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,560
Whether it's Twitter,
or it's something else,

864
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,160
the same way there was
MySpace and then Facebook,

865
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,120
there will always
more than anything else

866
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,720
be a need for
that actual product.

867
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,800
The globe needs a water cooler.

868
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,120
We will always have it.

869
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,480
We will always have that.

870
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,960
And I think it does hold a very

871
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,520
special place in the ecosystem.

872
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,880
- [Ross] Kieran,
what are your thoughts

873
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,480
from your perspective?

874
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,080
- [Kieran] Yeah I
think that, I don't have,

875
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,480
I think I agree
with Gary in terms of

876
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,320
it's product development,
right, there just

877
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,720
didn't seem to
iterate on the product,

878
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,480
and you see,
I think one of the things

879
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,280
Snapchat has proven,
and I'm definitely

880
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,640
one of the people
who thought Snapchat

881
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,120
was really fucking
stupid when I first used it.

882
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,840
And now I wear a
pair of spectacles,

883
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,720
it's like, dude,
they can build product.

884
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,760
And I think, but the
thing is, for any platform,

885
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,000
you were right,
it's competitive.

886
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,560
How much room do you
have for a different,

887
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,080
these types of communication
channels in your life?

888
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,280
It's a different
ballgame to pass from

889
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,040
200, 300 million into that

890
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,400
one billion that Facebook has.

891
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,040
And that's a
serious mountain to climb

892
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,560
I think for any of
those types of companies.

893
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,360
- I think an important
point that he just made

894
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,960
that's important for
everybody who's watching is,

895
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,080
everything is stupid,
until it's not.

896
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,640
Right? Like to me that is been
the most fascinating thing

897
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,760
over the last decade
in this space.

898
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,120
None of these platforms,
I mean, 2007, when I invested in

899
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,440
Twitter, it was beyond stupid
because you have to understand

900
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,840
social media
wasn't invented yet.

901
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,080
So forget about Snapchat being
stupid as a new social media

902
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,600
thing, at least we
accepted Facebook and Twitter.

903
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,280
We hadn't even accepted
the form of communication.

904
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,440
So it was like who gives a
shit if you're walking your

905
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,400
dog or eating a pizza?

906
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,120
A lot of people.

907
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,800
(group laugh)

908
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,840
- So Kieran just to kick us
off a nice bit, so one of the

909
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,760
issues, and then for everyone
here, is how do you start to

910
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,680
then develop what you will call
your social media strategy?

911
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,960
Or just your marketing,
digital marketing strategy?

912
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,560
What are the first
steps you would recommend?

913
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,080
- I think it's so, I talked
about this in my talk earlier,

914
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,440
but when, in any kind of,
when you come at it like an

915
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,640
acquisition strategy, or
you're acquiring, you're trying

916
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,360
to acquire an audience or
users for products or services,

917
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,880
like where I always recommend
to start spending their time

918
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,760
is actually talking to potential
customers or customers.

919
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,840
Right it's, you can play
around in data, but I think

920
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,640
actually polling like where
your customers spend their time

921
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,280
and how they purchase products
is one of the best ways you

922
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,760
can build out
different channel maps.

923
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,720
And I think what a lot of
business do is they go, I should

924
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,680
be on all businesses, all
channels at once, and they don't

925
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,920
do any one channel very well.

926
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,800
They just do
everything kind of average.

927
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,640
And typically when you're a
business or a startup, you're

928
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,320
actually gonna scale through
one or two channels, you're

929
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,960
gonna dominate one or two
channels and that's where you're

930
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,760
gonna get your growth from.

931
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,520
You're not gonna grow through
a mixture of being average in

932
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,720
a bunch of different things.

933
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,040
So I think trying to understand
you're dream customer,

934
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,840
where they spend their time
and how they consume,

935
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,000
consume content.

936
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,440
And trying to align your
strategy to be part of their day

937
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,840
and something that they want
to consume, not something like

938
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,280
you're trying to interrupt
them or you're trying to create

939
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,880
basically native content for
the platform that they live in.

940
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,160
- [Ross] Cool, Bruce I think
I know your answer,

941
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,440
but what would it be?

942
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,560
- You know I loved Gary's and
Tony's talk, you know, I spoke

943
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,480
to some film students
last week and, no doubt, in the

944
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,240
group of 100 film students
they'll be one student who uses

945
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,640
all the things available, and
works out how every social

946
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,080
platform from Pinterest,
to YouTube, to Instagram,

947
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,760
to Twitter will work for
them, to make them famous.

948
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:05,880
And the challenge for all of
us is trying to work out how to

949
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,240
make a platform work, but there
are people who have achieved

950
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,160
outstanding results
on all the platforms.

951
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,600
I think, quite often, we look
for the simple answer, rather

952
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,880
than think about what are we
looking to achieve and looking

953
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,120
for examples of 
people doing it well.

954
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,120
And pretty much
every platform, you know,

955
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,120
from Twitter, 
but through to Snapchat,

956
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,240
to Pinterest, has people
who are achieving remarkable

957
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,680
results on it.

958
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,360
- [Ross] Yeah, Yeah.

959
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:37,000
- [Gary] I think the answer is
to actually put in work.

960
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,600
Like there's no fuckin trick,

961
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,320
there's no algorithm.

962
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,840
There's no B2B SaaS product
that's going to help you do it.

963
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,640
Like everybody thinks that
there's some magical thing.

964
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,880
It's quality and quantity.

965
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,480
Because we're living in 
supply and demand issues.

966
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,600
To your point, DJ Khaled made

967
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,000
tens of millions of
dollars on Snapchat.

968
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,200
Maybe you didn't.

969
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,760
There are tens of thousands
of people who have made a

970
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,520
million dollars,
million dollars of profit,

971
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,360
through Pinterest.

972
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,320
You're absolutely right.

973
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,160
And so the problem is
people don't want to do work.

974
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,720
Like everybody wants to be an
influencer and get a brand to

975
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,560
pay them $50,000
to take a picture and a selfie

976
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,160
on Instagram, they
don't want to put in the work.

977
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,960
Plus, most
people aren't beautiful,

978
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,240
most people aren't funny,
most people aren't talented.

979
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,600
Like we need to actually
deploy more self-awareness, and

980
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,320
we need to deploy 
more understanding of what

981
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,680
we're actually
trying to achieve.

982
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,960
Like everybody's trying to
build the next Twitter, Hubspot,

983
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,080
Facebook, Twitter.

984
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,320
The reality is those
are .001% executions.

985
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,000
Meanwhile, everybody trying
to do that is going to put

986
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,560
themselves out of business,
and then go work at a bank

987
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,240
instead of trying to build a
business that does $284,000

988
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,320
a year, which then allows them
to like, like we completely

989
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,000
lack practicality in this space.

990
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,840
It's like Snapchat or bust.

991
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,960
Meanwhile you're gonna wake up
when we have a macroeconomic

992
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,480
correction, and it isn't as
good as it's been the last

993
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,840
nine years and you're gonna work

994
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,000
at fuckin'
Bank of America, dick.

995
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,280
(audience laughter)

996
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,800
- [Ross] So, from my end,

997
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,480
so like working
with tech companies,

998
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,000
one of the things
we always talk about

999
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,600
is a minimum viable product.

1000
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,800
What's the smallest version
that you can do to test, to find

1001
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,560
out where you can get traction
with your company,

1002
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,720
with your customers,

1003
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,360
with your platform,
that you can then develop.

1004
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,320
- That's super smart, but as
you know and I know, that's

1005
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,400
super hard when
you make three assets.

1006
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,280
- Yep, yeah.

1007
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,600
- Like the strategy right is
great, build, test, learn,

1008
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,760
grow, yes.

1009
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,760
But how do you put yourself
in a position where you're

1010
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,560
putting out 74 pieces
of content a day

1011
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,160
across 31 different platforms?

1012
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,760
Like, should I do blogging?

1013
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,560
Yes.

1014
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,640
Should I do a
video show on YouTube?

1015
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,280
Yep.

1016
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,480
Should you podcast?

1017
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,480
You sure should.

1018
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,240
Should I do
infographics on Pinterest?

1019
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,600
Mhmmm.

1020
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,240
You know like should
I do Instagram stories?

1021
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,400
Like people are like, Gary,
Instagram stories

1022
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,960
or Snapchat stories?

1023
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,560
Both, asshole.

1024
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,840
(audience laughter)

1025
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,760
Right? I mean your model and
my model break

1026
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,920
if they make one video.

1027
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,560
- [Ross] Yeah, but everyone
thinks it's gonna be that

1028
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,600
one video.

1029
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,200
- Right everyone's fuckin'
Dollar Shave Club out here.

1030
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,120
- [Ross] Yeah.

1031
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:25,800
- Okay

1032
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,720
- Kieran you must get this a
lot where people come to you

1033
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,960
and say, we want to
do everything, and then

1034
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,040
- Yeah, I think most people
- And they butcher it.

1035
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,200
- Like, I get that you should
do everything, but most people

1036
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,720
get disheartened when they
try to do everything,

1037
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,360
and none of them are successful.

1038
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,720
I think if you get into the
habit of being successful on

1039
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,400
one, the other
channels are easier to do.

1040
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,080
And I think people get into,
they'll go to conferences,

1041
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:56,280
they'll go back, they'll have
this moment where they're just

1042
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,800
really anxious and crushed
because they're not doing

1043
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,080
anything on 
any of these platforms,

1044
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,200
and they're trying to 
do everything at once.

1045
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,920
And they'll have 
one video on YouTube,

1046
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,600
they'll have a podcast
with one interview.

1047
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,920
They'll have some
Tweets and then

1048
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,840
they're like,
"Oh, this is exhausting

1049
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,120
"I'm just going to quit,

1050
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,440
"and go and work
at Bank of America."

1051
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,720
And I think that--
- [Gary] Oh and by the way I

1052
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,320
think that's right,
and it's because they suck.

1053
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,960
Like, like, like,
this is a very important

1054
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,960
thing--
- Or they don't have enough,

1055
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,120
they don't have the resources
other people have, right,

1056
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,680
if you're a team of two or
three people, how do you,

1057
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,480
it's harder to do everything.

1058
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,640
- Your resource is time.

1059
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,600
Stop playing fucking ping pong.
(audience laughter)

1060
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,560
No but I mean this and I
think, I'm jumping in because

1061
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,760
you're right, but we have
to macro this conversation.

1062
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,320
It goes back to your ambition.

1063
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,680
- [Kieran] Right.
- Right, you're right.

1064
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,080
My ambition is so large
that I have to do all that.

1065
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,240
To your point, if your ambition
is to make $81,000 being a

1066
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,800
flowers influencer, you
can do that on one platform.

1067
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,920
The problem is people's
ambition and strategy maps to

1068
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,360
being on everything, and
then they give up after three

1069
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,080
months on one thing, like
what do you think this is?

1070
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,920
- [Bruce] Yeah I think your
point is exactly right,

1071
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,160
because if you try 
and shortcut this,

1072
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,240
if you don't
understand the platforms,

1073
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,120
if you're not using 
the platforms on a daily basis,

1074
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,640
then you're gonna
try to look for the easy and

1075
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,280
someone says well
what's the reason?

1076
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,120
But if you understand the
platforms and then you know what

1077
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,520
your objective is,
then this makes sense.

1078
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,200
- You guys are both

1079
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:14,960
saying the--
- There's multi

1080
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,600
there's multimillion
business who grew just

1081
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,840
through Facebook.
- You're right.

1082
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,800
- That's what I'm saying like
if you dominate one channel,

1083
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,400
you can have a bigger
business than $81,000 a year.

1084
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,160
Like dominating one
channel is not a bad way to

1085
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,080
make a huge business.

1086
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,120
- No I actually think he's
exactly right, here's what your

1087
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,880
saying that I think is
interesting and it's just worth

1088
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,360
the debate, what if your company
could have been worth tens

1089
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,360
of millions of dollars if you
put your energy on YouTube

1090
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,160
versus Facebook but
you never tasted YouTube.

1091
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,920
You don't know if chicken is
your favorite food if you've

1092
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,040
only eaten beef.

1093
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,400
So I think your not wrong and
I think back to your strategy

1094
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,880
of test and learn, the
question becomes do you want to

1095
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,840
go out and try all those things
and then find that you're

1096
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,200
naturally over indexing on
voice, and doing podcasting.

1097
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,840
But the point of this
discussion is so important.

1098
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,640
There's a million ways to do it,

1099
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,440
there's just not a million
ways that you can do it,

1100
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,800
and that's the part that
needs to be figured out.

1101
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,960
- Fundamentally I have
a problem, everyone comes

1102
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,400
and wants a silver bullet.

1103
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,920
Everyone here is looking

1104
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,320
for what's Gary
going to tell me,

1105
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,000
that I'm going to get
the edge over everyone else.

1106
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,120
Just from say,

1107
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:17,960
the future is...

1108
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,760
Like Snapchat.
- [Gary] You're so right.

1109
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,040
- [Bruce] I used to work at a
publishing firm a long time ago,

1110
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,600
10 years ago and I used to
say to them, I used to implore

1111
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,840
everyone, you have to sign up
for Facebook and of course,

1112
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,480
what happened was
they were making magazines

1113
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,760
and they were certain
that these magazines were

1114
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,080
understanding exactly
what their readers wanted.

1115
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,520
I said, but unless
you're signed up to Facebook,

1116
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,720
you can't see what people
are starting to do to compete

1117
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,440
and I think it comes down to
that you can't necessarily

1118
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,480
fake things.

1119
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,440
And there are a lot
of people think, right,

1120
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,480
I haven't got the time to
learn how Pinterest works.

1121
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,960
I haven't got time to
work out how Twitter works.

1122
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,840
So just give me
the bullet points.

1123
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,080
And I don't think
that's ever as convincing

1124
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,600
as someone who has
deeply tried to understand

1125
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,760
and go through that
point where you think its dumb.

1126
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,080
You're never going
to be as convincing

1127
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,200
if you're trying to fake it.

1128
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,640
- [Gary] Do you know how many
people here, have opinions

1129
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,960
on Facebook advertising

1130
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,440
and have never placed
a fucking Facebook ad?

1131
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,120
(audience laughter)

1132
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,400
I mean, do people know? I mean,
I'm not sure if it's open to

1133
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,840
the Ireland market,
but in the U.S. for sure,

1134
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,000
Snapchats open
market of buying filters

1135
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,840
in an open place
marketplace is early Twitter,

1136
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,960
early Facebook and
early Google Adwords.

1137
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,960
You can buy filters for $5
for 20,000 square foot

1138
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,320
for an hour. So you
can know that there's

1139
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,800
this big high school
football game in Texas

1140
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,240
'cause that's religion there

1141
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,720
and your brand that
tries to reach high school kids

1142
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,840
and you could put a
filter over that school

1143
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:49,240
and you could buy it for $5 and
it's an incredible arbitrage,

1144
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,800
but nobody's a practitioner.

1145
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,760
They've got opinions on stuff.

1146
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,000
Everybody will read
a headline from TechCrunch

1147
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,200
or Ad Age or Fast Co.
They'll read something

1148
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,440
and they'll be like,
oh, Snapchat is dead.

1149
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,960
You don't know what the
fuck you're talking about,

1150
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,080
unless you're a practitioner
and even within them,

1151
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,400
there's opportunities, right?

1152
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,800
Yes, maybe at a macro,
I'm a little bit concerned

1153
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,440
about a Twitter ad,
but the reason I threw out,

1154
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,200
but in the video product is
even within the macro statement

1155
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,040
there's micro opportunities to
expose underpriced attention

1156
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,800
and that to me is where
getting your hands dirty

1157
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,640
matters so much.

1158
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,160
- [Russ] Just quickly, 'cause
we're nearly out of time,

1159
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,960
but one of the
questions I get asked a lot is,

1160
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,880
"How do you train up?"

1161
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,840
Because there's,
like, two elements

1162
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,320
to mastering social media.

1163
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,600
There's the skill, and
actually knowing how to do it,

1164
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:42,160
what to do, and there's
also the communications style

1165
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,080
that you have, that you
portray across that is your

1166
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,440
persona that comes
across in social media.

1167
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,840
Bruce, you can
start if you'd just like.

1168
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,000
What would be your
tips for people here

1169
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,680
and those listening on
how to start that journey?

1170
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,600
Like, two practical steps?

1171
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,160
- [Bruce] On a personal level,
how to--

1172
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,360
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1173
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,280
- [Bruce] So, what you're
asking, how to create

1174
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,160
your own voice on
social media, is that it?

1175
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,000
Okay, look, a lot of
people talk about authenticity,

1176
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,120
and it's sort
of become so tired.

1177
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,920
I think, you know, the
interesting thing is, like,

1178
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,920
start with what
you want to accomplish.

1179
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,000
I use social media principally
to talk about pop music,

1180
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,280
and I work at a
place where a lot of people

1181
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,520
at Twitter, when a
bit of news comes out,

1182
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,280
they all tweet out
the press release on it,

1183
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,640
and I'm not
interested in following that.

1184
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:32,560
For me, I don't use
Twitter as a B2B tool,

1185
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,920
but other people do,
so principally, you know,

1186
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,000
something like Twitter is,
it's about consuming

1187
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,640
what's happening right now.
So for me,

1188
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,800
a new pop song
drops on Friday morning,

1189
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,600
and that's what
I'm interested in.

1190
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,240
But what you tend to
find, and back to what we've

1191
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,640
been talking about here, is
that some people will come in

1192
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,640
and they'll post
things on social media,

1193
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,800
and it might be they're
trying to be an

1194
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,640
influencer LinkedIn, or they're
trying to rebrand themselves,

1195
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,760
and it feels unconvincing,
because they're trying

1196
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,240
to shoehorn some
opinions about programmatic

1197
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:06,440
into their Facebook feed,
and it's just uncomfortable.

1198
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,240
So, just knowing
what you want to do,

1199
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,880
or knowing why you're doing it,

1200
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,960
sends, like, a
pretty good idea to me.

1201
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,800
Sometimes, curiosity's
the reason to do it, right?

1202
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,200
You know, I've
just started podcasting.

1203
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,040
I've started podcasting,
firstly, because I'm just really

1204
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,840
curious about the
experience, how it works,

1205
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,800
the platforms, so
starting with curiosity's

1206
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,040
probably the right thing.

1207
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,000
The idea of us all
trying to present a more honest,

1208
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,520
nuanced version of
ourselves is great,

1209
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,080
as long as you've
got nuances and depth

1210
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,920
that people are gonna be
able to explore, I think.

1211
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,760
- [Russ] Kieran, obviously, your
Twitter handle is searchbrat.

1212
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,480
- Yeah, I need to change it.

1213
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,640
Doesn't go down well, and it
means something else in the U.S.

1214
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,200
I think, to jump
right on, that one thing

1215
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,760
I'm passionate about
is something Gary said,

1216
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,880
in that everyone in this space
should be a practitioner.

1217
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,760
I think that's, you never have
an excuse not to be able to

1218
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,600
try things.
So, like an example, last night,

1219
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,240
I was up building, like, a
chat bot for Facebook Messenger

1220
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,600
through a
platform called Chatfuel,

1221
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,200
'cause Facebook
are about to launch ads

1222
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,800
that allow you to send

1223
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,960
paid media straight into your
messenger bot, right,

1224
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,200
and it's so easy
to spin up a page,

1225
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,000
have a simple chat
bot, put it on Reddit,

1226
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,560
get some traffic in,
start to send things into it,

1227
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,840
so if you want to know
about something in that space,

1228
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,800
spend, like, a couple of
thousand dollars and go do it.

1229
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,800
If you're
ignorant in this space,

1230
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,720
then it's just
the wrong place to be.

1231
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,480
- [Russ] Yeah, right, you can't
outsource success, right?

1232
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,560
- Yeah, yeah.

1233
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,880
- [Gary] I know
we're sidetracking,

1234
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,840
but I wanna build on that,

1235
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,280
'cause it was
such a fun statement.

1236
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,400
Everybody here should
be trying to figure out

1237
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,240
how to do an Alexa
skill for their business.

1238
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,040
I'm working on one right
now that I'm gonna launch,

1239
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,600
and it's just, you know,
people's morning routines.

1240
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,640
I'm trying to debate if
I'm gonna do a motivational

1241
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,800
statement of the day,
or a tip on business,

1242
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,960
like, what people
don't understand

1243
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,960
is this is all
about beachfront property.

1244
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,760
You either buy it
right before Malibu

1245
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,240
becomes the
biggest beach in the world

1246
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,600
and you bought it
right on the beach

1247
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,520
and it's worth a trillion.

1248
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:03,280
You look at the early pioneers
on Twitter, blogging, search.

1249
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,000
People think trying something
new is a waste of time,

1250
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,440
at times, and I do love where
you're going with depth,

1251
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,640
by the way, but you gotta

1252
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,200
taste it just to be dangerous,

1253
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,840
because when you hit it,
and you're good at it,

1254
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,760
and if you're lucky
enough that you picked Snapchat

1255
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,240
instead of SocialCam,
and it becomes huge,

1256
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,120
you can really change your life.

1257
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,520
The upside's enormous.

1258
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,520
As far as your question,

1259
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,600
I just think the
truth always plays out.

1260
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,600
When I started talking
about business on Twitter,

1261
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,960
every single
comment in 2009 was,

1262
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,760
"Shut your
fucking mouth, wine boy.

1263
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,440
"Stay in your lane."

1264
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,280
but what they didn't
know was that was my truth.

1265
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,000
Long before I became the wine
guy on YouTube and Twitter,

1266
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I was a business man,
and I think if it's your truth,

1267
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,240
this goes back to the joke
I made about 21-year-old

1268
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,760
life coaches,
if you talk about the journey

1269
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,320
of trying to
become a successful,

1270
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,920
there's a very big
difference between being

1271
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,440
an entrepreneur and a
successful entrepreneur.

1272
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,520
I can say that
I'm a football player.

1273
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,720
Doesn't mean I'm
gonna get paid to do it.

1274
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,440
And so, I think the truth, like,

1275
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,440
you truly like that
music, I think it's unbelievably

1276
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,880
exciting for me,
it feels warm in my heart

1277
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,680
that the thing
I've seen consistently,

1278
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,960
analyzing this every
second of my breathing day

1279
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,680
for the last decade, has been
whatever your truth may be,

1280
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,800
as long as it is
actually your truth,

1281
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,480
you will always over-index.

1282
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,480
And people told me
to not curse on stage,

1283
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,920
you know, my
agents who booked, like,

1284
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,640
"Stop cursing on stage, 'cause
we're losing so much money."

1285
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,200
I'm like, I can't.

1286
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,920
I have to be me, and
wherever the chips fall,

1287
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,200
and I think for everybody, 
A, it's fun, 'cause it's easier,

1288
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,760
and B, audiences
are smart to your point.

1289
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,800
You can smell when that
person wants to put their

1290
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,000
agenda through, and
so I think the truth,

1291
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,640
which is a very exciting answer

1292
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,440
to this question,
the truth is undefeated.

1293
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,200
- [Russ] Well, I think that's a
very good place to finish,

1294
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,360
and I'd like to thank
Gary, Bruce, and Kieran

1295
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,320
for taking the time, and
for you for bearing with me

1296
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,080
with my ridiculous
voice, so thank you very much.

1297
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,000
(audience cheering
and applauding)

1298
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,600
- Nice to meet you.

1299
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,360
Nice to meet you, man.

1300
00:54:19,360 --> 00:00:00,000
(synthesized music)
