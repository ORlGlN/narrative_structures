1
00:00:00,157 --> 00:00:01,323
- What up, guys?

2
00:00:01,323 --> 00:00:02,638
The other day I spoke
at a really interesting

3
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:04,702
food and agricultural keynote.

4
00:00:04,702 --> 00:00:06,773
This is an incredible
keynote for a lot of people

5
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,574
in the B2B sector or the traditional

6
00:00:09,574 --> 00:00:11,875
$100 million dollar plus business sectors,

7
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:14,681
this is a keynote that
you should forward to

8
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,690
a bunch of your dads and
grandpops and grandmas

9
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,659
and grandpas, it's just
a very interesting talk.

10
00:00:19,659 --> 00:00:21,453
I felt, I mean this was,

11
00:00:21,453 --> 00:00:22,286
I was really in the zone.

12
00:00:22,286 --> 00:00:23,119
I hope you agree.

13
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,786
(uptempo music)

14
00:00:29,788 --> 00:00:30,621
Morning.

15
00:00:31,926 --> 00:00:34,014
Very, very happy to be here.

16
00:00:34,014 --> 00:00:37,697
Really enjoyed the opening monologue.

17
00:00:37,697 --> 00:00:41,119
In the context of today's morning,

18
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:42,912
I tweeted just now,

19
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:45,755
it's been interesting over
the last 72 hours whether

20
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:48,562
in a Wall Street Journal
interview or a business meeting,

21
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:52,157
now a conference, and a
lot of one-on-one meetings,

22
00:00:52,157 --> 00:00:54,478
I've heard the same thing
about 11 or 12 times

23
00:00:54,478 --> 00:00:57,523
and it struck me finally
this last time on stage

24
00:00:57,523 --> 00:01:00,285
which is how many people
keep saying the word

25
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:03,960
or the sentence it's
changing, it's changing.

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,855
I think anybody here this morning

27
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:10,646
that hasn't fully quantified
how much has actually changed,

28
00:01:10,646 --> 00:01:12,022
this has changed.

29
00:01:12,022 --> 00:01:14,764
I think there is an
unbelievable disconnect

30
00:01:14,764 --> 00:01:16,492
between the framework and strategy

31
00:01:16,492 --> 00:01:18,101
of how we are running our businesses,

32
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:22,345
whether a B2B or B2C
environment on us calibrating

33
00:01:22,345 --> 00:01:24,808
is it changing or has it changed?

34
00:01:24,808 --> 00:01:29,673
And more importantly, the
practicality of the timing.

35
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:33,289
I spend very little time on
the impact of self-driving cars

36
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:37,095
in a micro, in a 24 or 36 month window,

37
00:01:37,095 --> 00:01:40,920
but I try to understand and
quantify them in a macro.

38
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,404
And I think the thing that I've spent,

39
00:01:42,404 --> 00:01:45,860
and I'm a real hardcore,
purebred entrepreneur,

40
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,589
just to give you guys context
on the cross lines here,

41
00:01:48,589 --> 00:01:51,233
I was born in the Soviet
Union, came to the US,

42
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:53,783
lived in a studio apartment
half the size of this stage

43
00:01:53,783 --> 00:01:55,176
with eight family members,

44
00:01:55,176 --> 00:01:57,892
very old school, merchant upbringing.

45
00:01:57,892 --> 00:02:00,189
My dad got a job as a
stock boy in a liquor store

46
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:01,880
and we saved all our dollars.

47
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,042
I'm super an enigma.

48
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:06,295
All the Russian Jews that emigrated

49
00:02:06,295 --> 00:02:07,832
were straight A students.

50
00:02:07,832 --> 00:02:10,582
I was a straight D and F student.

51
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:14,521
It's really interesting,
I'm extremely bitter now

52
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:16,972
because I was making
three to $4,000 a weekend

53
00:02:16,972 --> 00:02:19,747
when I was 12 selling baseball cards,

54
00:02:19,747 --> 00:02:21,571
'cause that was the cultural phenomenon,

55
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:23,624
but I was a loser because
I was getting Ds and Fs

56
00:02:23,624 --> 00:02:25,849
because it was the late 80s, early 90s,

57
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:29,669
and the only ROI was the
college you were going to.

58
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:31,528
If I was making $4,000 a weekend

59
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:33,919
selling baseball cards today,

60
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,980
I would be the next Mark Zuckerberg

61
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,860
and on covers of magazines.

62
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,027
And so, I'm very fascinated by trends,

63
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:45,085
by things that happen,
but I think the thing

64
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:47,053
that has really worked
for me is I didn't realize

65
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:48,752
probably into the last decade,

66
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:53,148
I take a lot of pride when I
was an early investor a long,

67
00:02:53,148 --> 00:02:55,775
two, three, four years
pre-IPO or acquisition

68
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,755
on things like Twitter and
Facebook and Venmo and Uber.

69
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:00,617
I'm not in the luck business,

70
00:03:00,617 --> 00:03:03,638
I'm in the marathon running
business, and more importantly,

71
00:03:03,638 --> 00:03:05,320
I'm in the timing business.

72
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,447
I'm so deeply actually consumer-centric

73
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:10,726
that I don't have any other gear.

74
00:03:10,726 --> 00:03:13,494
The only thing I ever do
is try to reverse-engineer

75
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:16,107
the attention of my end consumer

76
00:03:16,107 --> 00:03:18,534
whether in a B2C or B2B environment,

77
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:21,022
and I try to understand things like,

78
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:25,785
it blows my mind how many
people here feel comfortable

79
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:29,808
because they have long-term
contracts and relationships

80
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:31,486
with some of the biggest
companies in the world

81
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:33,661
without realizing that
those companies themselves

82
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:37,759
are so disproportionately
vulnerable, and I just,

83
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,175
I play with this, right?

84
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:40,804
I play with the fact that $80 billion

85
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,990
is spent on television commercials

86
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,529
on the Fortune 500 CPG brand side,

87
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,931
yet 94% of them lost market share

88
00:03:47,931 --> 00:03:49,746
because not a human being on earth

89
00:03:49,746 --> 00:03:52,326
watches a television commercial.

90
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:53,469
None.

91
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:55,237
And by the way, can we
all agree this is not

92
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:57,621
a 14 year old girl crowd, right?

93
00:03:57,621 --> 00:04:00,872
We are a little bit
older here, but not old.

94
00:04:00,872 --> 00:04:02,287
Everybody here has got plenty of time.

95
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:03,173
How many people, actually, you know what?

96
00:04:03,173 --> 00:04:04,800
Let me frame up my entire talk here.

97
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,636
Before I go any further,
how many people in this room

98
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:11,214
are retiring within the next 10 years,

99
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:14,686
not because you're gonna
crush it and cash out,

100
00:04:14,686 --> 00:04:17,714
but because you're actually just old?

101
00:04:17,714 --> 00:04:20,015
(crowd laughing)
Just raise your hands.

102
00:04:20,015 --> 00:04:21,427
Okay, all right.

103
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,859
So for the 13 of you, I think
there's a level of grain

104
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:26,234
of a salt that we can take going forward,

105
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:27,787
but for the rest of you, I
want to tell you something

106
00:04:27,787 --> 00:04:29,419
that I really want to get across

107
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:32,989
as a framework to the strategy
of why this conversation

108
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:35,495
is disproportionately important and how,

109
00:04:35,495 --> 00:04:37,704
and I work with companies,
like say, P and G

110
00:04:37,704 --> 00:04:39,429
and a bunch of food service companies,

111
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:41,952
so I have a real sense
of context in this room.

112
00:04:41,952 --> 00:04:44,341
I want to leave you with
disproportionate practicality

113
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:47,986
of why I think you need to
look at your marketing spend,

114
00:04:47,986 --> 00:04:49,340
or more importantly, why you need

115
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,325
to start debating a marketing spend,

116
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,510
because if you are a
sales-driven organization

117
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,699
in a B2B environment, you are
disproportionately vulnerable,

118
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,004
so we need to talk about that.

119
00:04:58,004 --> 00:04:59,552
But before we get into that,

120
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:01,857
here's why I asked that 10 year question.

121
00:05:01,857 --> 00:05:05,222
Literally nothing we talk
about, or way more importantly,

122
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:08,089
literally nothing that
controls the attention

123
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:12,237
of our end consumer existed 13 years ago.

124
00:05:12,237 --> 00:05:14,872
We need to take a big step back
in this room and understand

125
00:05:14,872 --> 00:05:18,951
what we are talking about is
not social media or Snapchat,

126
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,954
what we are talking about is the maturity

127
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:25,775
of the internet itself, what
that means to the human race,

128
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:27,968
and everybody in this room, including me,

129
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:30,889
is so disproportionately misunderstanding

130
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:33,093
how substantial this shift is

131
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:35,859
and what happens over the
course of the next decade.

132
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:39,026
The internet is the middleman, period.

133
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:42,144
And it's maybe just not your turn.

134
00:05:42,144 --> 00:05:45,022
It was the bookstore's turn first.

135
00:05:45,022 --> 00:05:48,937
It was some guy or gal that
owned 13 medallions in taxis

136
00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:51,523
in this city second or third.

137
00:05:51,523 --> 00:05:55,220
It is the hotel rooms
and the supply and demand

138
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,042
of that world's turn today.

139
00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:02,857
It is the media companies across
the board's turn right now

140
00:06:02,857 --> 00:06:04,667
and it may be your business next.

141
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:07,196
Walmart's not gonna give you the contract,

142
00:06:07,196 --> 00:06:09,327
Walmart's gonna have to do
it itself, they're gonna be,

143
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,984
they're gonna buy dairy farms,

144
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:15,362
they're gonna grow the grain,
everything gets shrunk.

145
00:06:15,362 --> 00:06:17,451
And so we have to take a real step back

146
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:21,047
and understand that there
is only one thing, one,

147
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,572
there's one thing that will keep you

148
00:06:23,572 --> 00:06:25,624
from being a commodity;

149
00:06:25,624 --> 00:06:27,173
Your brand.

150
00:06:27,173 --> 00:06:29,899
The only thing that will keep you away

151
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:33,150
from being completely
commoditized is your brand.

152
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,612
Can you create an environment

153
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:37,248
where somebody actually
makes an emotional decision

154
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:40,574
or a subconscious decision,
not a practical one?

155
00:06:40,574 --> 00:06:42,319
Because if you're in the middle

156
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,891
and people are gonna
make practical decisions,

157
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:47,624
there's an enormous amount of
vulnerability in the system.

158
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:50,584
We are completely and utterly
controlled by this device

159
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:51,949
whether you like it or not.

160
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:55,363
Please, my friends, do not
make business decisions

161
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:56,740
because of your personal,

162
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,789
romantic point of view of technology.

163
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:02,484
The amount of people here that
will dictate their businesses

164
00:07:02,484 --> 00:07:05,115
to failure because of their points of view

165
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:07,592
of when they go out, they find it sad

166
00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:09,192
that people look at their phones

167
00:07:09,192 --> 00:07:12,487
instead of talk to each
other is staggering to me.

168
00:07:12,487 --> 00:07:16,054
And so look, this is real
disruption, this isn't ha ha,

169
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:19,284
this is over the course
of the next decade,

170
00:07:19,284 --> 00:07:24,283
90, 80, 70% of the biggest
companies in multiple sectors

171
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:27,871
will not only decline
but completely diminish

172
00:07:27,871 --> 00:07:30,437
and completely vanish.

173
00:07:30,437 --> 00:07:32,765
I look at the fashion industry,

174
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:34,420
it's just so fascinating, literally,

175
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,784
they're all out of business.

176
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:37,265
The math is just not gonna work.

177
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:39,378
Every day, there are brands that go

178
00:07:39,378 --> 00:07:41,766
from zero to $15 million in sales

179
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:44,439
on the back of influencers on Instagram

180
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:47,749
with no overhead or
infrastructure, at scale.

181
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:51,291
And the cut of those
thousand cuts is staggering.

182
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,149
And this all is on top of you can talk,

183
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:56,577
we can talk about food trends

184
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:58,210
and the behavior of the end consumer,

185
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,487
that's absolutely right, that's fine.

186
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:04,869
That is minor leagues
compared to the fundamental

187
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:06,640
human shifts we're going through.

188
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,717
Did anybody see the robot that
went viral on the internet

189
00:08:09,717 --> 00:08:10,799
the other day?

190
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:12,845
There's a robot that was
doing twists and turns.

191
00:08:12,845 --> 00:08:15,744
How many people, just raise
your hands, I'm curious.

192
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:18,912
Did you see what Elon Musk said about it?

193
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:19,954
Which was, so there's this robot,

194
00:08:19,954 --> 00:08:21,541
you have the find this, I don't
have a lot of data on this,

195
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,509
so you know, it's in the feed,

196
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:24,519
in the headline reading society,

197
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,137
I don't like to talk
about things I don't know,

198
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:27,182
here's what I know.

199
00:08:27,182 --> 00:08:30,741
A robot that scared the crap
out of me was in my feed.

200
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:35,721
Just doing stuff that makes
LeBron look like me, right?

201
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:37,636
Elon Musk decides to take that,

202
00:08:37,636 --> 00:08:39,903
somebody more educated
in robotics than I am,

203
00:08:39,904 --> 00:08:41,792
and said something very clever

204
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:43,764
and I know enough about
how he communicates

205
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:46,900
where he's like, "You think this is cute?"

206
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,301
In 24 or 36, I don't remember the timing,

207
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:53,221
very shortly, you won't even
be able to see this robot

208
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:55,741
without technology that
it would be so fast

209
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:58,568
that the human eye can't even see it.

210
00:08:58,568 --> 00:08:59,798
Now why do I bring that up?

211
00:08:59,798 --> 00:09:01,944
I bring that up because it's a proxy.

212
00:09:01,944 --> 00:09:03,541
It's a proxy to the following.

213
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,668
Everybody in this room needs to realize

214
00:09:05,668 --> 00:09:06,985
that we are about to run

215
00:09:06,985 --> 00:09:10,652
an incredibly fascinating
business marathon,

216
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:14,362
and most of you aren't
even on the treadmill yet.

217
00:09:14,362 --> 00:09:15,206
And let me explain.

218
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:18,311
The treadmill to me is
how you spend your money

219
00:09:18,311 --> 00:09:20,411
on marketing and sales.

220
00:09:20,411 --> 00:09:22,632
The one place that you
could leave here today,

221
00:09:22,632 --> 00:09:24,480
walk out the door, fly home,

222
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,939
and do something about
what I'm talking about

223
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:31,037
is how you spend money to get revenue in.

224
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:35,060
I am fascinated by people in the B2B space

225
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,664
to think it's ROI positive to
buy booths and full-page ads

226
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:43,579
in B2B magazines in
2018 and not understand

227
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:45,528
how Facebook advertising works

228
00:09:45,528 --> 00:09:48,125
to become a top of the funnel
conversion sales funnel

229
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,089
for their business.

230
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:54,065
I'm fascinated, I am fascinated
that a room like this

231
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:57,705
with as many successful
people as sit in these chairs

232
00:09:57,705 --> 00:10:01,375
have unbelievable opinions
of Facebook advertising

233
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:05,069
without ever running a
Facebook ad in their lives.

234
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:07,818
You have a whole lot of
opinions based on stock prices

235
00:10:07,818 --> 00:10:10,843
or a headline you read or
what the Wall Street Journal

236
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:13,300
wrote on the issue nine months ago,

237
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,487
yet you lack practitionership
to understand

238
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:17,016
exactly what's happening here.

239
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,843
And we are living through
the great divide right now,

240
00:10:18,843 --> 00:10:20,939
my friends, of the headline readers

241
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:23,753
and the practitioners when it
comes to running businesses.

242
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:27,197
And by the way, that last line, society.

243
00:10:27,197 --> 00:10:31,648
All these confusions of how
things are changing is the deep

244
00:10:31,648 --> 00:10:34,171
either lack of interest to look at it

245
00:10:34,171 --> 00:10:37,479
because it's so heady that
it's so scary to understand

246
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:39,424
how big of a shift this is,

247
00:10:39,424 --> 00:10:43,257
or the naivete, or worst
of all, the audacity.

248
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:46,652
Every business that is CFO-driven,

249
00:10:46,652 --> 00:10:51,255
short-term, 90-day-driven
financial arbitrage machines

250
00:10:51,255 --> 00:10:53,958
are on-call because
they haven't quantified

251
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,303
that the ground that they're
standing on has changed

252
00:10:56,303 --> 00:10:59,490
and that's been a stable
ground in consumer behavior.

253
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,173
Look, consumer behavior
is super interesting

254
00:11:01,173 --> 00:11:02,570
for the last 70 years.

255
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,097
What we don't quantify is
that for the last 70 years,

256
00:11:06,097 --> 00:11:09,483
the propaganda that made
you make business decisions

257
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:11,206
stayed the same.

258
00:11:11,206 --> 00:11:15,373
It was print, television, radio,
direct mail, it was basic.

259
00:11:17,168 --> 00:11:21,598
The internet is such a
harder place to navigate.

260
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,739
And what's interesting, and
let me take a step back,

261
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:27,313
to frame up what my passion
is my opening rant sits on,

262
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:28,791
I only have one move.

263
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,008
How many people here by show
of hands are familiar with

264
00:11:31,008 --> 00:11:33,850
Mariano Rivera, the New
York Yankees pitcher

265
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,708
that pitched for 20 years?

266
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,152
I'm just curious, because
I want to use the analogy.

267
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:39,108
Okay, good enough, I'll use it.

268
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:41,181
20 years, closer for the Yankees,

269
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:43,892
goes down as one of the great
all-time players of all time,

270
00:11:43,892 --> 00:11:45,290
the guy had one pitch.

271
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,246
We had others for the
baseball nerds in here,

272
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:49,642
but the fact the matter
is, he had one pitch,

273
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,697
and nobody could hit it.

274
00:11:50,697 --> 00:11:52,639
Edgar Martinez from the
Mariners could hit it.

275
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,063
Nobody could hit it for 20 years.

276
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:57,038
And that's what I have.

277
00:11:57,038 --> 00:11:59,590
I suck at most things, but
I will buy the New York Jets

278
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,588
and win seven Super Bowls,

279
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:02,835
which will cost me billions of dollars

280
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:04,085
because I have one pitch,

281
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:05,838
and is what I'm trying to shove down

282
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:09,420
the throat of this room which
is I day trade attention

283
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,854
and you better start
understanding what I mean by that.

284
00:12:11,854 --> 00:12:13,687
I day trade attention.

285
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,112
No matter what you do in this room,

286
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:19,156
for the people presenting to
the most senior executive here,

287
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,450
whether you have a side
business when you go home

288
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,758
that you're passionate about,

289
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:25,535
which is selling jelly
direct-to-consumer on Amazon,

290
00:12:25,535 --> 00:12:28,834
I don't know you and I don't
know what you're up to,

291
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:31,964
but let me promise you, the
one thing that I can talk about

292
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:33,255
that connects everybody here

293
00:12:33,255 --> 00:12:34,804
and will bring value to everybody

294
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:37,388
is before you tell me
how good your thing is,

295
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:38,748
you need my attention.

296
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:42,292
Many rely on historic
natures of the business,

297
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:45,185
the sales funnel, the B2B
nature, the contracts,

298
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:46,950
the way it's been.

299
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,752
Others, 25% of this room
probably spend their time

300
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:51,287
thinking about the consumer.

301
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:53,844
How many people here actually
are in B2C businesses?

302
00:12:53,844 --> 00:12:54,816
Raise your hands.

303
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:55,947
Just curious.

304
00:12:55,947 --> 00:12:57,772
Just higher, if you don't mind,

305
00:12:57,772 --> 00:12:58,910
because I want to navigate
my talk, thank you.

306
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,109
B2B.

307
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:01,359
The rest, okay.

308
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:05,594
I'm fascinated, let me
go very tactical on you

309
00:13:05,594 --> 00:13:07,388
because I really want to go to Q an A,

310
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:08,622
so I want to set up as much framework,

311
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:09,914
but I'm gonna go a little tactical,

312
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,247
maybe it'll spur a question.

313
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:16,903
I'm watching SaaS companies
that have a million dollars

314
00:13:16,903 --> 00:13:20,402
in funding create disproportionate wealth

315
00:13:20,402 --> 00:13:21,735
by running Facebook ads

316
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:24,748
against the employees of segmentation.

317
00:13:24,748 --> 00:13:26,016
I believe that a lot
of people in this room

318
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:28,839
don't understand that
their company can run ads

319
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:31,929
against the employees of an organization

320
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:33,390
they are trying to do business with.

321
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,852
That ad may say, "Does
your head buyer know,

322
00:13:36,852 --> 00:13:40,194
"does your CIO know, does your CFO know

323
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,732
"the fact that I can run
ads that cost me $4 CPMs

324
00:13:43,732 --> 00:13:45,664
"that are actually being consumed

325
00:13:45,664 --> 00:13:48,246
"and that the creative of
the video or the presentation

326
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:50,718
"or the white paper or the paragraph

327
00:13:50,718 --> 00:13:54,485
"or the image with words on it
starts with copy in the post

328
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:57,735
"that says does your blank
within your organization know

329
00:13:57,735 --> 00:14:01,306
"which then leads to between
1.3% and 4% of people

330
00:14:01,306 --> 00:14:03,990
"forwarding it to that
person whether janitor

331
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,907
"or C-suite co-worker?"

332
00:14:07,602 --> 00:14:09,177
To then convert in top of funnel

333
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:11,991
is something I've never
seen in B2B in the 20 years

334
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:13,859
of being a practitioner in marketing,

335
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:16,418
both traditional and direct
mail and radio and television

336
00:14:16,418 --> 00:14:19,413
and outdoor and digital,
my passion sits here today

337
00:14:19,413 --> 00:14:20,561
because I know that Facebook

338
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:23,994
is the disproportionate
arbitrage for this room,

339
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:25,897
and I also am empathetic to know

340
00:14:25,897 --> 00:14:28,448
why nobody would believe
that in a B2B environment

341
00:14:28,448 --> 00:14:32,026
in this room, but it doesn't
make it any less true.

342
00:14:32,026 --> 00:14:33,838
And because building my dad's business

343
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:36,379
from a three to a $60 million business,

344
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:37,967
which was a liquor store in New Jersey

345
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:40,934
over a five year window
with no dollars at all,

346
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:44,434
no cash infusion, no VC was very difficult

347
00:14:45,303 --> 00:14:46,744
but the only reason I pulled it off

348
00:14:46,744 --> 00:14:48,716
is because I day traded attention.

349
00:14:48,716 --> 00:14:51,287
In 1996, I started an email newsletter

350
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:52,750
when nobody was doing that,

351
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,378
and I had 91% open rates
for the first four years

352
00:14:56,378 --> 00:14:58,694
of my career, which is unheard of.

353
00:14:58,694 --> 00:15:02,822
And then Google came out and
I bought wine terms on Google

354
00:15:02,822 --> 00:15:05,630
for five cents a click from the word wine

355
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,912
to the word Silver Oak.

356
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:10,576
And when I hear, and it
wasn't in the bio here,

357
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,409
but a lot of times they're like,

358
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:13,730
"And he took his business
from three to $60 million",

359
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,849
I cringe in the corner before I come on

360
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:19,174
because I say to myself,
"It should have been 250."

361
00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:20,795
And the reason it should have been 250

362
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,887
was because I was one
of the first advertisers

363
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:25,066
on Google AdWords because I was on there

364
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:26,679
the day it came out.

365
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:29,215
It was so grossly under-priced attention,

366
00:15:29,215 --> 00:15:33,132
but I was too young to
understand that it was so big

367
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,440
that it was a once-in-a-lifetime,
a twice-in-a-lifetime,

368
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,150
maybe a three-times-in-a-lifetime

369
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,583
in my 60-year career
arbitrage to build wealth

370
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,458
on such underpriced attention.

371
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,316
I stand here with this energy

372
00:15:46,316 --> 00:15:47,687
because I have a chip on my shoulder

373
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:49,567
because I'm mad that I
didn't understand it,

374
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:52,899
and that I spent money on
direct mail and print and radio

375
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:54,794
and sales and many other things.

376
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:56,346
How many people here play poker?

377
00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:58,087
Raise your hands.

378
00:15:58,087 --> 00:15:59,046
Thank you.

379
00:15:59,046 --> 00:16:01,299
When you have the best
hand, you go all-in.

380
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:03,818
I had it, and I didn't.

381
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:06,029
The best hand as I stand here today,

382
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:07,862
and I could care less if it's not tomorrow

383
00:16:07,862 --> 00:16:10,445
'cause I day trade is Facebook.

384
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,618
And you have to, at a bare minimum,

385
00:16:14,618 --> 00:16:16,976
understand how to start
spending money in that world,

386
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,836
not because it's gonna be so
disproportionately ROI positive

387
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:23,661
for your business, though I
think any dollar spent there,

388
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:24,874
if you actually know how to do it,

389
00:16:24,874 --> 00:16:28,064
will be better than what
you spend anywhere else,

390
00:16:28,064 --> 00:16:31,976
it's because you need to start at the top,

391
00:16:31,976 --> 00:16:35,928
creating a cadence to
understand how to market

392
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:39,017
and sell in the new
environment that we live in.

393
00:16:39,017 --> 00:16:41,817
There is no way that you
will be an organization

394
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:45,434
that has success and
machine learning and AI

395
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:47,466
and any other things that are gonna happen

396
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:51,633
from 2020 to 2030 if you don't
understand how to communicate

397
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:56,155
in the mobile-first
environment that is today.

398
00:16:56,155 --> 00:16:58,547
You will not have the
taste or understanding,

399
00:16:58,547 --> 00:17:02,426
and to be very frank,
some won't even get there.

400
00:17:02,426 --> 00:17:05,343
And so it's a very fascinating time

401
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:09,601
and the stakes are extremely high.

402
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:13,768
When I look at the businesses
in this room from afar,

403
00:17:14,788 --> 00:17:17,323
when I look at the current marketplace,

404
00:17:17,323 --> 00:17:21,367
I get enormous passion
because it's so avoidable,

405
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:24,821
but the problem is, even the
three people in this room

406
00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:26,788
that are inspired and are
actually gonna do something

407
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:28,329
about this will outsource it

408
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:30,406
and not become the
practitioners themselves

409
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:32,159
which will then create the vulnerability

410
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,576
because 95% of the execution of the thesis

411
00:17:34,576 --> 00:17:37,282
that I just talked about
right here is garbage

412
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:39,785
and is being done in the
best interest of the partner,

413
00:17:39,785 --> 00:17:43,014
not necessarily your organization.

414
00:17:43,014 --> 00:17:44,451
We live in a very tricky world.

415
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:46,541
In my thesis of day trading attention,

416
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:50,015
the Super Bowl is the number
one under-priced asset.

417
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:51,284
Here I am talking about digital

418
00:17:51,284 --> 00:17:55,491
and crap like machine learning,
and even for B2B companies,

419
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,431
I think the best thing
you could spend money on

420
00:17:57,431 --> 00:17:59,586
is the Super Bowl in North America,

421
00:17:59,586 --> 00:18:01,637
because you know every single American

422
00:18:01,637 --> 00:18:03,680
will know what you have to say

423
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,042
if you actually execute that
30-second spot properly.

424
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:09,132
It's 100% penetration.

425
00:18:09,132 --> 00:18:11,569
It's under-priced at $7 million a pop.

426
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:14,399
Meanwhile, a lot of you
spend money on digital,

427
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,021
may spend money on digital.

428
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:17,954
Most likely not because I was digging,

429
00:18:17,954 --> 00:18:21,674
a lot of sales-driven, we'll
get into that in a minute,

430
00:18:21,674 --> 00:18:24,879
and I believe that
programmatic digital buying

431
00:18:24,879 --> 00:18:28,957
is the most garbage overpriced
marketing in the marketplace

432
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:30,090
that nobody in this room,

433
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,863
just like they don't consume a commercial,

434
00:18:31,863 --> 00:18:35,711
ever goes to a website and
carefully consumes a banner ad

435
00:18:35,711 --> 00:18:38,162
below the fold and then clicks that banner

436
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:39,830
and gets into the funnel,

437
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,731
yet billions of dollars being
poured into that environment.

438
00:18:42,731 --> 00:18:44,702
And so what's tricky about it

439
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:48,396
is in a keynote environment like this,

440
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:50,055
I can only go top-line.

441
00:18:50,055 --> 00:18:53,330
In reality, there's so much
depth underneath this thesis

442
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,693
in the practitionership,
but what is most important

443
00:18:56,693 --> 00:19:00,880
is understanding what
happens with the next chapter

444
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,763
of companies that own the attention.

445
00:19:03,763 --> 00:19:07,096
Amazon and Google and Facebook and Apple

446
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,903
are not kidding around.

447
00:19:10,903 --> 00:19:13,628
They're building a layer on
top of the internet itself.

448
00:19:13,628 --> 00:19:15,800
The internet is where we live our lives.

449
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,064
This is now secondary,
whether you like it or not,

450
00:19:19,064 --> 00:19:20,984
by the allocation of attention time.

451
00:19:20,984 --> 00:19:22,253
It just is.

452
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:26,177
This is secondary, and it's
gonna get extreme in a VR world

453
00:19:26,177 --> 00:19:29,177
and for a lot of us, we will never see it,

454
00:19:29,177 --> 00:19:30,611
but you think this is intense?

455
00:19:30,611 --> 00:19:33,359
You think it's bad kids
are on iPads during dinner?

456
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:35,433
Kids are gonna live in pods in San Diego

457
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:38,776
and be in the internet 20 hours a day.

458
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:42,444
We will see that, 20,
30, 40 years once VR,

459
00:19:42,444 --> 00:19:45,122
VR is the only potential
technology at this point

460
00:19:45,122 --> 00:19:48,366
that can arbitrage the
internet out itself.

461
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:49,555
The majority of this room,

462
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,015
and I'm looking at the faces and the ages

463
00:19:51,015 --> 00:19:55,495
will wear contact lenses that
mix them between real life,

464
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:59,662
AR, like Santa Claus is giving
the keynote with me right now

465
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:04,213
or VR, you're just literally
in a different place right now.

466
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:07,463
And so this phone that seems so intense

467
00:20:08,513 --> 00:20:12,266
and you can't live without
it, this is a pager.

468
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:13,744
Remember those pagers?

469
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:15,653
This crew remembers the pager.

470
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:16,846
As a matter of fact, do
you know there are people

471
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:18,599
in this room who said they
would never get a mobile device

472
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:20,270
because their pager was good enough,

473
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,568
and if they needed to get a hold of you,

474
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:25,620
"I'll get back to you and
I can get back to you"?

475
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,814
So another thing I want to talk about,

476
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,737
because I think it might,
I'm gonna go very high level,

477
00:20:28,737 --> 00:20:30,016
but I do think for this kind of room,

478
00:20:30,016 --> 00:20:31,338
some people will understand this.

479
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:32,724
This is what I'm spending all my time on,

480
00:20:32,724 --> 00:20:35,304
this is why I believe that
the Alexa and the Google Home

481
00:20:35,304 --> 00:20:37,109
and the Apple Pod are the next arbitrage

482
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:38,772
and I think a lot of you
should think about this

483
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:40,111
and this is where sales people

484
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:42,087
can become disproportionately trained

485
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:45,858
or arbitraged out completely,
let's talk about it.

486
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:47,257
At the top of the framework,

487
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:49,219
the reason I invested in Uber years ago

488
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:51,529
was not because I thought
they sold transportation,

489
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:54,208
it was because they sold you back time.

490
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:57,878
Every person here besides
health, wealth and religion

491
00:20:57,878 --> 00:21:00,360
and their family put time in the pedestal

492
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,203
of the things that
matter to them the most.

493
00:21:02,203 --> 00:21:03,263
You do it every day.

494
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:06,091
You give up privacy,
you spend tons of money

495
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:07,511
to arbitrage time.

496
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:09,176
Uber doesn't sell transportation,

497
00:21:09,176 --> 00:21:12,629
Uber sells the perception of time.

498
00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:15,361
The thing that will sell
the most time back to us

499
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:20,137
over the next decade will be
voice devices that are smart.

500
00:21:20,137 --> 00:21:23,063
I buy toothpaste now in my bathroom

501
00:21:23,063 --> 00:21:25,846
in one second through Alexa.

502
00:21:25,846 --> 00:21:26,804
I don't make a note,

503
00:21:26,804 --> 00:21:29,081
I don't grab my phone and
buy it on Amazon, I say,

504
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:30,448
"Alexa, order me toothpaste."

505
00:21:30,448 --> 00:21:31,935
She says, "Sure."

506
00:21:31,935 --> 00:21:34,917
I say, "Buy this", and
the transaction is done.

507
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:37,455
How many of you have an Amazon Echo or Dot

508
00:21:37,455 --> 00:21:38,999
or a Google Home device in your homes?

509
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:40,513
Raise your hands.

510
00:21:40,513 --> 00:21:41,574
Great.

511
00:21:41,574 --> 00:21:45,965
Most people are using it
for music, which is nice,

512
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:49,535
but where this device
is going is staggering.

513
00:21:49,535 --> 00:21:51,181
And the potential is enormous.

514
00:21:51,181 --> 00:21:52,654
I saw a startup the
other day, for example,

515
00:21:52,654 --> 00:21:54,749
that I'm probably gonna
invest in that you say,

516
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:57,715
"Alexa, I'm reading the
book", you tell 'em the book,

517
00:21:57,715 --> 00:22:00,613
"Jack and Jill", you start
reading the book to your child

518
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:02,656
and as you're reading, the Alexa is doing

519
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:06,386
a surround sound narrative
along with you, in unison.

520
00:22:06,386 --> 00:22:08,212
You say, "And then it started raining",

521
00:22:08,212 --> 00:22:10,798
and the whole room
sounds like it's raining.

522
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:13,567
There will be not a child
on earth in seven years

523
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:15,732
that will accept a book read to them

524
00:22:15,732 --> 00:22:18,039
without 360 supported sound.

525
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:20,373
(crowd laughing)

526
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:24,188
More importantly, the things
that you will do in your car

527
00:22:24,188 --> 00:22:28,093
when you travel when you think
of it to use a voice device

528
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:31,570
to get it done, reorder your
product, the smartification,

529
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,547
when an IOT device, when
technology is in our food

530
00:22:34,547 --> 00:22:36,727
and it's reordering itself for you,

531
00:22:36,727 --> 00:22:41,192
every person here is going
to have a smart refrigerator

532
00:22:41,192 --> 00:22:43,600
in a decade that reorders the products

533
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,975
in your refrigerator for you.

534
00:22:45,975 --> 00:22:48,611
Amazon's vulnerability is no retailer

535
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:50,265
that has physical locations.

536
00:22:50,265 --> 00:22:53,706
I don't care what M and
A activity Walmart has,

537
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,104
Amazon's vulnerability is the smart home

538
00:22:56,104 --> 00:22:57,795
that reorders products for you

539
00:22:57,795 --> 00:22:59,439
without you doing it for them.

540
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:02,013
Toll Brothers is a bigger
competitor to Amazon

541
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,934
if when you buy a new home,
it is stocked with products

542
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:07,798
that just keep reordering
themselves for you.

543
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:10,050
When you go into that kitchen
cabinet for the first time

544
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,012
and the toothpaste and
deodorant is picked for you

545
00:23:12,012 --> 00:23:14,346
'cause it's free and
it just reorders itself

546
00:23:14,346 --> 00:23:16,071
when it's being used up,

547
00:23:16,071 --> 00:23:18,932
when your Crest toothpaste
understands you've got

548
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:22,609
one goddamn squeeze left and
it reorders itself for you

549
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,306
and it comes just as
you're squeezing it out,

550
00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:26,946
you'll start understanding what I mean.

551
00:23:26,946 --> 00:23:28,924
And every person in this room will see it.

552
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:31,428
My friends, please do me one favor,

553
00:23:31,428 --> 00:23:33,090
and this is the advantage you have

554
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,486
over the 25 year old that gets it,

555
00:23:35,486 --> 00:23:39,236
you underestimated the
internet 13 years ago.

556
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:42,955
Please take your mental
place back to where it was,

557
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:46,365
remind yourself of the
embarrassment statements

558
00:23:46,365 --> 00:23:48,315
that you made like the internet itself

559
00:23:48,315 --> 00:23:50,080
is a fad 15 years ago,

560
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,742
that Facebook was a fad and
you would never be on it,

561
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:56,659
that you would never send an emoji,

562
00:23:57,653 --> 00:24:01,535
please, please understand
that I only have one pitch

563
00:24:01,535 --> 00:24:02,618
and here it is;

564
00:24:02,618 --> 00:24:04,794
I know what you're gonna do before you do

565
00:24:04,794 --> 00:24:07,772
because we like to say
no before we say yes,

566
00:24:07,772 --> 00:24:09,605
but we have no choice.

567
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,540
Now, you live your life how you want.

568
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,674
You know how to parent and grandparent,

569
00:24:16,674 --> 00:24:18,819
you do with your money what you want,

570
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:22,166
blah blah blah blah blah,
but do not bring that

571
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,393
to the business environment.

572
00:24:24,393 --> 00:24:26,901
Your responsibility as
an executive is to be

573
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:29,936
100% unemotional on these issues

574
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:31,902
when it comes to the business environment.

575
00:24:31,902 --> 00:24:33,300
That's what we do.

576
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,741
And so please leave your opinions at home

577
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:38,854
on what's happening to the human race.

578
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:41,593
Let me remind you that
Elvis shaking his hips

579
00:24:41,593 --> 00:24:44,037
was once considered a devil move.

580
00:24:44,037 --> 00:24:45,858
Understand this is all evolution.

581
00:24:45,858 --> 00:24:48,035
The robots will kill us in the end,

582
00:24:48,035 --> 00:24:50,368
hopefully not for us to see,

583
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,080
but realize that the
upside of this next decade,

584
00:24:57,185 --> 00:25:00,154
all this conversation I just had,

585
00:25:00,154 --> 00:25:02,177
I'm curious how this is
going through your head

586
00:25:02,177 --> 00:25:04,328
because for me, everything out of my mouth

587
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:07,661
for the last 20 minutes sets up offense.

588
00:25:10,031 --> 00:25:12,239
The problem is, so many people
are successful, have scale,

589
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:15,214
and they see defense in
what comes out of my mouth.

590
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:18,405
You have leverage in the distribution

591
00:25:18,405 --> 00:25:21,282
or the business
architecture you've created,

592
00:25:21,282 --> 00:25:25,725
so this disruption of
that is not interesting

593
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:27,871
because your leverage
sits in distribution.

594
00:25:27,871 --> 00:25:30,818
The problem is all,
distribution of all kinds

595
00:25:30,818 --> 00:25:32,485
is now commoditized.

596
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:36,784
And so what you need to
do is what I try to do

597
00:25:36,784 --> 00:25:39,202
every day of my life, I
will go into my office today

598
00:25:39,202 --> 00:25:43,216
and I will try to put
myself out of business.

599
00:25:43,216 --> 00:25:44,515
I will go into my office today

600
00:25:44,515 --> 00:25:46,163
and try to put myself out of business.

601
00:25:46,163 --> 00:25:47,984
I will look at what we do

602
00:25:47,984 --> 00:25:51,516
and I will try to understand
who can come along and kill us

603
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,442
if I don't make the long-term investment.

604
00:25:54,442 --> 00:25:58,609
To make short-term P and L
decisions for your own bonuses,

605
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:03,006
the stock price, the
board, or what have you

606
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:06,308
in today's environment is business suicide

607
00:26:06,308 --> 00:26:09,986
because every company has to
make long-term investments

608
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:13,789
because the C-changes
are so extraordinary.

609
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:15,122
I run an agency.

610
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:19,631
We're gonna do $114 million in
revenue this year from zero,

611
00:26:19,631 --> 00:26:20,798
six years ago.

612
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:24,675
We're gonna make $1.4
million dollars in profit,

613
00:26:24,675 --> 00:26:26,775
triple-checked yesterday, right?

614
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:28,439
We made $1.3 million in
profit the third year

615
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:30,134
when we did $6 million.

616
00:26:30,134 --> 00:26:31,031
Why?

617
00:26:31,031 --> 00:26:33,559
Because I'm losing millions of
dollars building capabilities

618
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:37,280
around voice and machine
learning and AI and messenger

619
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,991
and everything else that
I know in 36 months,

620
00:26:39,991 --> 00:26:42,204
the Pepsis and Coca Colas and Budweisers

621
00:26:42,204 --> 00:26:44,422
and Nikes of the world are gonna need

622
00:26:44,422 --> 00:26:46,524
to have a chance to succeed.

623
00:26:46,524 --> 00:26:48,355
It's not fun for my,

624
00:26:48,355 --> 00:26:51,438
the saddest human on earth is my CFO.

625
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,713
He literally hates his life.

626
00:26:58,997 --> 00:27:00,830
I feel so bad for him,

627
00:27:01,816 --> 00:27:03,998
because I want to give him autonomy

628
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:07,128
and I respect his position
and I let him do his thing,

629
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:09,095
and then he gets to the goal line

630
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:10,853
and I send him all the way back

631
00:27:10,853 --> 00:27:14,234
because this is the only
framework that has success

632
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:15,385
in today's environment,

633
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:18,634
the lack of risk and chances
people are taking in here,

634
00:27:18,634 --> 00:27:20,581
even though they know they are right

635
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:22,387
because of playing for the short-term,

636
00:27:22,387 --> 00:27:26,215
oftentimes for your own
human selfish reasons

637
00:27:26,215 --> 00:27:28,417
because of the timing
of how long you will be

638
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:31,420
in that position is the
fascinating thing to me

639
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,386
in the business environment today.

640
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:37,303
Short-term stuff works in the past.

641
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:42,235
Wall Street dynamics work, bonus
structures work, it worked.

642
00:27:42,235 --> 00:27:43,515
It will not.

643
00:27:43,515 --> 00:27:45,574
And that is why the long-term players

644
00:27:45,574 --> 00:27:47,829
will continue to eat up attention

645
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:51,098
and deploy anything they want.

646
00:27:51,098 --> 00:27:53,930
Amazon and Google and Apple,

647
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:58,097
Facebook are not gonna
stop at the things, I mean,

648
00:27:59,061 --> 00:28:03,228
I was so stunned and disappointed
by the collective surprise

649
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:08,221
of Amazon buying Whole Foods.

650
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:09,388
I was stunned.

651
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,673
I'm just shocked that so many smart people

652
00:28:13,673 --> 00:28:15,252
were like, "Whoa."

653
00:28:15,252 --> 00:28:16,724
Whoa what?

654
00:28:16,724 --> 00:28:19,075
How do you think this plays out?

655
00:28:19,075 --> 00:28:21,316
Do you know what Chase
Bank's biggest competitor is?

656
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:22,149
Amazon.

657
00:28:23,205 --> 00:28:25,913
What do you think is happening here?

658
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:29,100
This is the biggest cultural
shift to the human race

659
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,978
since the printing press
and it magnifies by 10 X.

660
00:28:31,978 --> 00:28:35,424
Do you understand the
ramifications of the Blockchain?

661
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:39,134
You can talk about Bitcoin
being $10,000 all day long,

662
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:42,630
that is the pager to
what the Blockchain is.

663
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,438
Blockchain decentralizes the human race.

664
00:28:46,438 --> 00:28:49,234
Blockchain, not Bitcoin, not Ethereum,

665
00:28:49,234 --> 00:28:53,597
Blockchain is something that
Russia, America and China

666
00:28:53,597 --> 00:28:56,213
agree on and will stop

667
00:28:56,213 --> 00:28:59,112
because it's their biggest vulnerability.

668
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:02,161
Everything in the middle is vulnerable.

669
00:29:02,161 --> 00:29:04,927
All of you are in the middle.

670
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:06,260
And so now what?

671
00:29:07,244 --> 00:29:09,790
I think what happens is the following.

672
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,812
I'm gonna throw you for a real loop here.

673
00:29:11,812 --> 00:29:12,645
I'm gonna close with this

674
00:29:12,645 --> 00:29:13,825
because I really want to go into Q and A.

675
00:29:13,825 --> 00:29:15,320
Let me set up the Q and A.

676
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,229
The reason I really want to do Q and A is

677
00:29:17,229 --> 00:29:20,417
I've made my statement,
you're gonna have other talks,

678
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:22,534
I kind of was listening to the agenda,

679
00:29:22,534 --> 00:29:26,542
I'm desperate for people to
ask very basic 101 questions

680
00:29:26,542 --> 00:29:28,080
because my intent when I speak is to get

681
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,942
one or two people to do something.

682
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:33,818
I have no ambition to get
five, 10, 20, 30% of this room

683
00:29:33,818 --> 00:29:36,953
to act on this thesis,
it's just not practical

684
00:29:36,953 --> 00:29:38,751
in their short-term financial interest,

685
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:39,879
but if I get one, two, or three,

686
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:41,695
so for those people that are curious,

687
00:29:41,695 --> 00:29:43,622
please get ready, simple questions.

688
00:29:43,622 --> 00:29:46,740
How does a B2B food service
provider use Facebook

689
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,046
to get an extra account?

690
00:29:48,046 --> 00:29:49,644
I don't care, wherever you want to go.

691
00:29:49,644 --> 00:29:51,477
But before I go there,

692
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:56,185
I really want to talk about the fact that

693
00:29:58,636 --> 00:30:01,368
the historical legacy stakes are very high

694
00:30:01,368 --> 00:30:02,760
of what I'm talking about,

695
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,828
the compounded nature of
the marketplace is very high

696
00:30:05,828 --> 00:30:06,910
of what I'm talking about.

697
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,099
Here's what I mean by that.

698
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:11,517
The scale that we now
live in is so extreme.

699
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:14,204
The ability to go from zero
to a million to 100 million

700
00:30:14,204 --> 00:30:16,966
is so quick because of how much attention

701
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:17,984
is in these phones.

702
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:20,107
You have to look at it most practical,

703
00:30:20,107 --> 00:30:21,438
this gentleman here
with the nice yellow tie

704
00:30:21,438 --> 00:30:24,090
is working while this is happening.

705
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,210
This is just, which I'm
cool with, do your thing--

706
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,793
(crowd laughing)

707
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,619
But it's fun for me, right?

708
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:32,884
Because you have to understand
how incredible that is.

709
00:30:32,884 --> 00:30:35,447
That is not something we
could all do 15 years ago,

710
00:30:35,447 --> 00:30:38,578
there's just, I'm trying to
really push through here,

711
00:30:38,578 --> 00:30:41,478
please, stop underestimating.

712
00:30:41,478 --> 00:30:43,094
Stop underestimating.

713
00:30:43,094 --> 00:30:44,459
You have sales staff?

714
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:45,734
How many people here have sales staff?

715
00:30:45,734 --> 00:30:46,647
Raise your hands.

716
00:30:46,647 --> 00:30:49,003
Great, let me talk to you
what I think you should do.

717
00:30:49,003 --> 00:30:51,361
You should start an internal podcast

718
00:30:51,361 --> 00:30:53,909
that you program every week

719
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:55,807
that is made for your sales team

720
00:30:55,807 --> 00:30:59,603
because the toolkits and
the PDFs and the emails

721
00:30:59,603 --> 00:31:02,321
and the off-sites and awarding one guy

722
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:04,757
the good thing he did
that we all want you to do

723
00:31:04,757 --> 00:31:09,382
a year award at the end is
not doing what you need.

724
00:31:09,382 --> 00:31:12,263
But, they are on the move.

725
00:31:12,263 --> 00:31:15,092
They are consuming content
at scale in their car.

726
00:31:15,092 --> 00:31:17,816
They can listen to your
podcast which is internal

727
00:31:17,816 --> 00:31:19,939
and all 1,600 of them can listen,

728
00:31:19,939 --> 00:31:23,248
and you can push propaganda
down their throat 24/7

729
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:26,397
if you understand how to give them value

730
00:31:26,397 --> 00:31:29,997
in 60% of the content,
entertainment, escapism,

731
00:31:29,997 --> 00:31:31,993
something that benefits them

732
00:31:31,993 --> 00:31:34,413
so that you can subtly bring in yours in.

733
00:31:34,413 --> 00:31:36,358
I believe that the businesses in this room

734
00:31:36,358 --> 00:31:37,699
have to take a page out of something

735
00:31:37,699 --> 00:31:39,098
that has been done historically

736
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:41,933
by companies like the
Michelin Tire Company

737
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,778
and Guinness Beers Company.

738
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:45,594
I believe the people in
this room that understand

739
00:31:45,594 --> 00:31:49,310
that they are now a media
company first, comma,

740
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,814
and then whatever comes out of your mouth

741
00:31:50,814 --> 00:31:52,213
or is on your business card

742
00:31:52,213 --> 00:31:54,195
that you will have the
framework of success

743
00:31:54,195 --> 00:31:55,329
for the next decade.

744
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:57,341
Let me explain.

745
00:31:57,341 --> 00:31:58,728
I believe that if you understand

746
00:31:58,728 --> 00:32:02,111
why the Michelin Tire
Company 100 years ago

747
00:32:02,111 --> 00:32:06,750
decided to start reviewing
villas and hotels and restaurants

748
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,804
throughout Europe because
they wanted people

749
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:12,342
to start driving and using up their cars

750
00:32:12,342 --> 00:32:14,728
and stopping at their
stations and getting gas,

751
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:17,211
and more importantly, changing tires,

752
00:32:17,211 --> 00:32:19,630
they started pumping propaganda,

753
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:23,053
a guide in the cities of London and Paris

754
00:32:23,053 --> 00:32:25,726
which remarkably and coincidentally

755
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:29,179
scored all the best foie
gras and champagne lists

756
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:32,101
40 miles outside the city,

757
00:32:32,101 --> 00:32:34,020
and forced people to go and see what this

758
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,314
three-star chateau was,

759
00:32:36,314 --> 00:32:38,682
and they used a media property to create

760
00:32:38,682 --> 00:32:41,015
the business behavior that they wanted,

761
00:32:41,015 --> 00:32:44,046
that the Guinness Book came out because

762
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:46,919
Guinness was losing market share in pubs,

763
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,799
but knew that people talked
about trivia and fun facts

764
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:51,808
in the pubs through their market research

765
00:32:51,808 --> 00:32:53,513
and created the Guinness
Book of World Records

766
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,286
because they would hope
that you would talk about

767
00:32:55,286 --> 00:32:58,823
a 17-foot man, and then the Guinness brand

768
00:32:58,823 --> 00:33:01,084
would be reinforced and it
would come out of your mouth

769
00:33:01,084 --> 00:33:01,917
at the pub.

770
00:33:01,917 --> 00:33:05,545
These are two historically
unbelievably successful

771
00:33:05,545 --> 00:33:07,133
media executions.

772
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:10,913
My belief is that if
you actually understood

773
00:33:10,913 --> 00:33:12,837
in the same way that it
is impossible for you

774
00:33:12,837 --> 00:33:15,223
to not have a CFO or a controller,

775
00:33:15,223 --> 00:33:18,448
it is impossible for you
not to have a head of sales,

776
00:33:18,448 --> 00:33:20,596
I believe for most of your organizations

777
00:33:20,596 --> 00:33:22,028
in the next five to 10 years,

778
00:33:22,028 --> 00:33:23,761
it will be impossible for you not to have

779
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:26,727
an editor-in-chief of your business.

780
00:33:26,727 --> 00:33:30,196
You are not at the mercy of
the in-between media companies,

781
00:33:30,196 --> 00:33:31,881
you can go direct.

782
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:34,318
You can start the most meaningful podcast.

783
00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:37,192
You can start the most
meaningful podcast tomorrow

784
00:33:37,192 --> 00:33:40,353
for all the franchisee
owners of every QSR company

785
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:42,870
in America by giving them information

786
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,752
that makes them run their business better,

787
00:33:44,752 --> 00:33:47,506
and then use all of
that attention to deploy

788
00:33:47,506 --> 00:33:49,895
what you want to accomplish
in your business.

789
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:51,095
You can.

790
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,725
It's super far-fetched, it
doesn't feel comfortable,

791
00:33:53,725 --> 00:33:55,766
but it didn't feel
comfortable for the executives

792
00:33:55,766 --> 00:33:58,600
at the Nintendo Company
to switch from being

793
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,535
a playing card company
to a board game company

794
00:34:01,535 --> 00:34:03,535
to a video game company.

795
00:34:04,996 --> 00:34:08,931
The evolution that is needed
in the strategies in this room

796
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:12,621
when it comes to marketing
and sales are extraordinary.

797
00:34:12,621 --> 00:34:13,942
They're extraordinary.

798
00:34:13,943 --> 00:34:17,652
And please do not rely
on what got you here.

799
00:34:17,652 --> 00:34:20,200
It's exactly what is
not going to allow you

800
00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:22,315
to get to the next stage.

801
00:34:22,315 --> 00:34:25,039
So that's where I'm at, that's
what I'm thinking about.

802
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,940
I want to put a couple more points on,

803
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,102
and where are the runners for the Q and A?

804
00:34:29,103 --> 00:34:30,610
Just got a couple?

805
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,221
Okay, awesome, just raise
your hands in a second,

806
00:34:32,221 --> 00:34:34,774
just looking at the timing.

807
00:34:34,774 --> 00:34:36,330
I'll leave with this, and
then we'll do some Q and A,

808
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,918
we'll take it from there.

809
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,376
And please think about your question.

810
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:44,177
Much bigger, better companies than yours

811
00:34:44,177 --> 00:34:45,927
went out of business.

812
00:34:48,447 --> 00:34:50,142
It's history.

813
00:34:50,143 --> 00:34:53,043
And what is happening
now to the infrastructure

814
00:34:53,043 --> 00:34:56,342
of our society is something
we're gonna have to navigate,

815
00:34:56,342 --> 00:34:59,284
so please check your audacity at the door,

816
00:34:59,284 --> 00:35:01,506
nobody cares about your
contracts or your history.

817
00:35:01,506 --> 00:35:03,319
It's your vulnerability.

818
00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:04,258
Thank you.

819
00:35:04,258 --> 00:35:07,175
(crowd applauding)

820
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:17,620
- [Woman] I'm gonna help you
sort of find our question.

821
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,336
- Awesome, who's got a question?

822
00:35:19,336 --> 00:35:20,169
- [Woman] Do we have anybody?

823
00:35:20,169 --> 00:35:21,669
Oh, we've got lots of hands.
- Yeah.

824
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:23,027
- [Woman] All right, we'll
start out over there.

825
00:35:23,027 --> 00:35:25,560
- It's the greatest
keynote I've ever given.

826
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,516
Hey.
- Very interesting.

827
00:35:26,516 --> 00:35:27,750
Thank you very much.
- What's your name?

828
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,583
- [Roy] Oh, Roy Foster.

829
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:29,416
- Roy.

830
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,287
- [Roy] I'm curious with
your mindset right now

831
00:35:31,287 --> 00:35:33,483
where to take your marketing spin.

832
00:35:33,483 --> 00:35:34,316
- Yes.

833
00:35:34,316 --> 00:35:36,436
- [Roy] How do you see
that potentially shifting

834
00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:38,991
with repeal of net neutrality?

835
00:35:38,991 --> 00:35:40,774
- That's a super great question.

836
00:35:40,774 --> 00:35:42,584
Roy, one thing, you can see I can peacock

837
00:35:42,584 --> 00:35:44,122
with the best of them.

838
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:46,636
I hate to answer stuff that
I haven't fully quantified.

839
00:35:46,636 --> 00:35:48,547
I'm spending a ton of
time of trying to play

840
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:50,155
not only the short, look,

841
00:35:50,155 --> 00:35:51,564
guys like me and gals like me,

842
00:35:51,564 --> 00:35:54,066
there's a lot to be said,
like screw you, the tollbooth,

843
00:35:54,066 --> 00:35:55,093
this is terrible.

844
00:35:55,093 --> 00:35:56,821
I'm a funny, it's so funny,

845
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:00,387
maybe I'm intense capitalism
because I was born in communism

846
00:36:00,387 --> 00:36:04,282
and I'm so fascinated by the countermove.

847
00:36:04,282 --> 00:36:05,798
Let's say it plays through.

848
00:36:05,798 --> 00:36:07,014
What next?

849
00:36:07,014 --> 00:36:08,958
Cool, so the ISPs are this,

850
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,669
but why can't Facebook
and Google and Apple

851
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,274
arbitrage that out by deploying all,

852
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:16,563
great, everything gets overcharged, great.

853
00:36:16,563 --> 00:36:19,157
You have Verizon and they give you Yahoo,

854
00:36:19,157 --> 00:36:23,084
blistering fast for free,
but Google costs $50 a month.

855
00:36:23,084 --> 00:36:24,540
Something a lot of people
here have not quantified

856
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,951
their head around that
is a very real statement,

857
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,784
and I mean like this, right?

858
00:36:29,784 --> 00:36:31,298
Everybody's like, with
little headline readings,

859
00:36:31,298 --> 00:36:32,753
like Matt Lauer and this and this,

860
00:36:32,753 --> 00:36:34,599
everybody's paying
attention to so many things,

861
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:35,860
you wake up and in 18 months,

862
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,560
you're paying $50 a month
for the right to use Google.

863
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,586
That's like, what the
hell just happened, right?

864
00:36:40,586 --> 00:36:43,822
But here's what's funny about the game.

865
00:36:43,822 --> 00:36:47,318
What happens next is
more interesting, right?

866
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:49,895
As they start getting fat,

867
00:36:49,895 --> 00:36:52,621
the people that are getting
commoditized by them and hurt

868
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:55,593
have the ability to arbitrage them out.

869
00:36:55,593 --> 00:36:57,408
And by the way, I'm so pumped,

870
00:36:57,408 --> 00:36:59,148
I'm so thrilled you
brought up that question.

871
00:36:59,148 --> 00:37:00,956
That's my biggest fear here.

872
00:37:00,956 --> 00:37:04,345
There's a lot of people
here who play in the ISP,

873
00:37:04,345 --> 00:37:06,705
net neutrality environment
in their business.

874
00:37:06,705 --> 00:37:09,078
They think they've got it locked up,

875
00:37:09,078 --> 00:37:11,682
until their customer's out of business,

876
00:37:11,682 --> 00:37:13,875
until their customer's
being squeezed so much

877
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:17,294
by the innovators of Tesla
or Facebook or Amazon

878
00:37:17,294 --> 00:37:18,872
that they have to start
changing their business model,

879
00:37:18,872 --> 00:37:21,477
and they don't want you
to make profit anymore.

880
00:37:21,477 --> 00:37:24,133
It's not about is Walmart or
McDonald's go out of business,

881
00:37:24,133 --> 00:37:26,009
is it that they are losing enough business

882
00:37:26,009 --> 00:37:30,604
that they don't want you
to make a penny ever again.

883
00:37:30,604 --> 00:37:32,057
So what do I think?

884
00:37:32,057 --> 00:37:34,787
I think day trading attention

885
00:37:34,787 --> 00:37:36,796
is something I'd become committed to,

886
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:40,160
which is I think about it
when it becomes the reality

887
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,674
and I just do it immediately.

888
00:37:41,674 --> 00:37:43,963
I spend time trying to be
thoughtful about these things.

889
00:37:43,963 --> 00:37:45,269
You can't predict a lot of things.

890
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:46,937
I made a video nine months ago that said

891
00:37:46,937 --> 00:37:50,195
Instagram was in trouble
because Snapchat was exploding.

892
00:37:50,195 --> 00:37:52,126
Facebook's much younger than people think.

893
00:37:52,126 --> 00:37:54,287
A week later, and they copied
everything of Snapchat,

894
00:37:54,287 --> 00:37:55,411
and they're the disproportionate

895
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:56,702
most important platform to market

896
00:37:56,702 --> 00:38:00,772
if you care about consumers
25 to 40 in North America.

897
00:38:00,772 --> 00:38:04,939
So I think it's potentially
annoying, potentially dangerous,

898
00:38:05,928 --> 00:38:09,467
feels really not fun, but
there's places that have it.

899
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:11,413
You can look at what
Portugal's market looks like,

900
00:38:11,413 --> 00:38:14,418
but I don't think they're
ready to pay 11 bucks a month

901
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:17,456
for Facebook being the speed it is now

902
00:38:17,456 --> 00:38:20,277
versus it being free, but taking an hour.

903
00:38:20,277 --> 00:38:21,884
Do you know how mad everybody gets here

904
00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:24,073
when their internet is
100th of a second slower

905
00:38:24,073 --> 00:38:26,812
than what they're accustomed to?

906
00:38:26,812 --> 00:38:27,829
Right?

907
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:31,508
I mean so I think it's a
very interesting tollbooth

908
00:38:31,508 --> 00:38:34,661
and I'm excited to watch it play out,

909
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:37,275
but I don't get crippled on what if.

910
00:38:37,275 --> 00:38:38,623
I'm more worried than everybody here's

911
00:38:38,623 --> 00:38:42,283
wasting money right now, tomorrow.

912
00:38:42,283 --> 00:38:44,337
And that's why when people
talk about VR and AR,

913
00:38:44,337 --> 00:38:46,740
or it's changing or it's
coming, I'm like, no, no no,

914
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,056
what are you doing today?

915
00:38:49,056 --> 00:38:49,904
Where was your money,

916
00:38:49,904 --> 00:38:51,566
do you know you know what's fun

917
00:38:51,566 --> 00:38:54,294
is not being at the mercy of sales people

918
00:38:54,294 --> 00:38:56,715
and their commissions and
structures and bonuses.

919
00:38:56,715 --> 00:38:58,660
Brand, have the leverage.

920
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,577
Brand is the only leverage we have.

921
00:39:02,421 --> 00:39:03,721
Questions?

922
00:39:03,721 --> 00:39:04,980
We've got a gentlemen here.

923
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,513
- Let's go--
- Yeah.

924
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:08,677
- To that same table.
- Okay, same table.

925
00:39:08,677 --> 00:39:09,558
How are you?

926
00:39:09,558 --> 00:39:10,754
- [Woman] Good, thank you.

927
00:39:10,754 --> 00:39:11,587
- [Gary] What's your name?

928
00:39:11,587 --> 00:39:13,027
- I'm Annie.
- Annie.

929
00:39:13,027 --> 00:39:14,456
- [Annie] I have a question.

930
00:39:14,456 --> 00:39:16,137
How do you, can you hear me?

931
00:39:16,137 --> 00:39:17,712
- Yes.

932
00:39:17,712 --> 00:39:20,869
- [Annie] How do you translate taste?

933
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:23,503
Which is key to what we do food and Ag.

934
00:39:23,503 --> 00:39:25,723
How do you translate that on the internet

935
00:39:25,723 --> 00:39:30,330
or through virtual reality
or whatever the format is?

936
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:33,412
- The historic translator
of taste that over-indexes

937
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,230
is called video.

938
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:39,209
A human being articulates
through a visual and words

939
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:42,036
what they are experiencing
and we consume it, right?

940
00:39:42,036 --> 00:39:44,506
None of this stuff is any
different than anything happens.

941
00:39:44,506 --> 00:39:46,939
The same thing that Julia
Childs did, that Emeril did,

942
00:39:46,939 --> 00:39:49,057
that many other things have been done

943
00:39:49,057 --> 00:39:51,756
is being done now by somebody on Instagram

944
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:52,820
in a one-minute video.

945
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,371
I think everything is translated
through three core things;

946
00:39:56,371 --> 00:39:58,543
Audio, video, and the written word.

947
00:39:58,543 --> 00:39:59,389
The end.

948
00:39:59,389 --> 00:40:01,929
How everybody consumes
information here is different,

949
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:04,950
the historical upside is in video.

950
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:08,446
It's the biggest penetrator of our psyche.

951
00:40:08,446 --> 00:40:12,228
I would say video, but where and how much?

952
00:40:12,228 --> 00:40:14,683
You can make an $800,000
video that is a commercial

953
00:40:14,683 --> 00:40:16,259
on television on the Food Network

954
00:40:16,259 --> 00:40:19,133
that not a soul will watch, in my opinion.

955
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:21,560
You can make a YouTube video in 2006

956
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,839
when nobody else was doing it

957
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:24,558
and get a tremendous land grab.

958
00:40:24,558 --> 00:40:26,811
I think about attention like real estate.

959
00:40:26,811 --> 00:40:28,768
I want you to buy beachfront
property in Malibu

960
00:40:28,768 --> 00:40:30,435
63 years ago, right?

961
00:40:31,873 --> 00:40:34,623
Not overpriced real estate on the

962
00:40:37,224 --> 00:40:40,054
Meatpacking District in Manhattan.

963
00:40:40,054 --> 00:40:42,167
And I think that's what
the majority of people do

964
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:43,800
because it's tried and
true without understanding

965
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,550
how overpriced it is.

966
00:40:48,472 --> 00:40:50,057
- [Woman] We have another
question over here.

967
00:40:50,057 --> 00:40:50,890
- Over there, great.

968
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,458
Who's got it?

969
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:53,610
Let's go.
- Down the center there.

970
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,443
- Okay.

971
00:40:57,762 --> 00:40:58,595
How are you?

972
00:40:58,595 --> 00:41:01,986
- [Nick] Very well, that was a
quite frightening, thank you.

973
00:41:01,986 --> 00:41:04,015
Nick from Rabobank.

974
00:41:04,015 --> 00:41:04,848
Two things.

975
00:41:04,848 --> 00:41:09,011
One, why Facebook, why not
Instagram, whatever, Twitter?

976
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:11,024
And also you talk a lot about attention,

977
00:41:11,024 --> 00:41:14,160
and we keep hearing
that the attention span

978
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,907
of people is getting shorter and shorter

979
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:18,080
so how do you maintain their attention?

980
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,698
- So when I talk about Facebook,

981
00:41:19,698 --> 00:41:20,589
you can hold the mic for a second,

982
00:41:20,589 --> 00:41:22,081
'cause this might be a follow-up,

983
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:24,850
Facebook and Instagram,
owned by the same company.

984
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,310
When I talk, it's a nuance
of the business talk,

985
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,605
I do want to talk Instagram.

986
00:41:28,605 --> 00:41:30,621
Facebook, because it's scale.

987
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:33,446
So the highest conversion selling stuff

988
00:41:33,446 --> 00:41:37,294
that I know in the world is 60
to 80 year olds on Facebook.

989
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:40,248
Not conventional wisdom,
not the headlines you read,

990
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:42,521
but as a practitioner,
there's a lot of nuances

991
00:41:42,521 --> 00:41:44,557
to figuring out why it's
been working for me.

992
00:41:44,557 --> 00:41:47,446
Number one, a 72 year old on Facebook

993
00:41:47,446 --> 00:41:51,667
goes through their
Facebook stream like this.

994
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:53,336
(crowd laughing)

995
00:41:53,336 --> 00:41:55,883
A 17 year old goes through
that same stream like this.

996
00:41:55,883 --> 00:41:57,960
It's just attention arbitrage, right?

997
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,418
So Facebook, 'cause of its scale.

998
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:02,893
Instagram's on its way,
but Instagram plays 15 to

999
00:42:02,893 --> 00:42:05,253
let's say 45, 50 on the coasts,

1000
00:42:05,253 --> 00:42:07,671
it plays 15 to 35 in the middle,

1001
00:42:07,671 --> 00:42:11,079
Facebook is 25 because
it's not winning under--

1002
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:12,178
- [Nick] The minute I got on Facebook,

1003
00:42:12,178 --> 00:42:13,562
my daughter got off it.

1004
00:42:13,562 --> 00:42:14,420
- That's exactly right.

1005
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,508
It's classic cops and robbers, right?

1006
00:42:17,508 --> 00:42:19,996
And now parents are getting on Instagram,

1007
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,152
and they're looking elsewhere,

1008
00:42:21,152 --> 00:42:22,583
and Snapchat more 'cause it disappeared.

1009
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:23,894
We've all been there.

1010
00:42:23,894 --> 00:42:25,120
We've all locked our room,

1011
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,761
we all wanted a second phone line,

1012
00:42:26,761 --> 00:42:28,634
we all understand that dynamic.

1013
00:42:28,634 --> 00:42:30,936
That to me is like secondary fodder.

1014
00:42:30,936 --> 00:42:32,294
I just want to know
where the attention is.

1015
00:42:32,294 --> 00:42:34,155
Facebook is so ridiculously under-priced.

1016
00:42:34,155 --> 00:42:34,988
Let me explain.

1017
00:42:34,988 --> 00:42:38,354
You will pay seven dollars to
get in front of 1,000 people

1018
00:42:38,354 --> 00:42:40,075
which 13 will actually see it,

1019
00:42:40,075 --> 00:42:41,378
'cause they'll go through it,

1020
00:42:41,378 --> 00:42:45,197
but you're gonna pay $58 for
that same thing in four years.

1021
00:42:45,197 --> 00:42:46,338
That's all.

1022
00:42:46,338 --> 00:42:47,577
I don't know else to say.

1023
00:42:47,577 --> 00:42:49,711
If you've ever run a
Google AdWords campaign,

1024
00:42:49,711 --> 00:42:52,328
the word wine cost me five
cents a click one day,

1025
00:42:52,328 --> 00:42:54,774
it now costs me $14 a click.

1026
00:42:54,774 --> 00:42:56,865
Marketplaces are supply and demand,

1027
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,393
which means there's
vulnerabilities in them.

1028
00:42:59,393 --> 00:43:02,497
Attention spans, there's a lot
of conversations around this.

1029
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:05,770
First of all, it's old talk audacity.

1030
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:08,298
We love to say new people
are not as good as us

1031
00:43:08,298 --> 00:43:11,304
because we're getting
older and closer to the end

1032
00:43:11,304 --> 00:43:13,142
and it's our defense, right?

1033
00:43:13,142 --> 00:43:15,764
We love to talk about the
Millennials' entitlement.

1034
00:43:15,764 --> 00:43:18,577
90% of the people I know that
I grew up with in their 40s

1035
00:43:18,577 --> 00:43:20,413
were lazy and entitled too.

1036
00:43:20,413 --> 00:43:23,403
(crowd laughing and applauding)

1037
00:43:23,403 --> 00:43:25,071
- [Nick] That's just Americans, isn't it?

1038
00:43:25,071 --> 00:43:27,879
- Yeah.
(crowd laughing)

1039
00:43:27,879 --> 00:43:30,471
You know it's funny, there's
a lot of truth to that,

1040
00:43:30,471 --> 00:43:32,048
but that's a hell of a
lot better than Europeans

1041
00:43:32,048 --> 00:43:33,600
who aren't even in the game.

1042
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:38,247
(crowd laughing and applauding)

1043
00:43:38,247 --> 00:43:39,611
By the way, the Chinese
are gonna kill everybody

1044
00:43:39,611 --> 00:43:40,836
because that's the way you,

1045
00:43:40,836 --> 00:43:42,244
by the way, you know
what's crazy about China?

1046
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,722
They run their country the
way we run our businesses.

1047
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:48,568
Our businesses are
capitalistic with dictatorship.

1048
00:43:48,568 --> 00:43:50,373
It's really funny to
watch it all play out.

1049
00:43:50,373 --> 00:43:52,071
Nonetheless, I'm not worried
about attention spans

1050
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:54,627
because I like when things are all equal.

1051
00:43:54,627 --> 00:43:56,182
It's back to net neutrality.

1052
00:43:56,182 --> 00:43:57,977
As long as every other
person I'm competing with

1053
00:43:57,977 --> 00:44:00,697
is dealing with the same
ramifications then I'm cool, right?

1054
00:44:00,697 --> 00:44:02,912
And I think that's the part
that's making it so interesting.

1055
00:44:02,912 --> 00:44:05,030
As the technologies advance,

1056
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,435
we get put into more of a
playing field that's equal

1057
00:44:07,435 --> 00:44:09,285
which takes away a lot of the advantages

1058
00:44:09,285 --> 00:44:11,306
we had historically, and that's the rub.

1059
00:44:11,306 --> 00:44:12,962
Retail didn't need to go out of business.

1060
00:44:12,962 --> 00:44:16,225
We just need to do enough
more retail on e-commerce

1061
00:44:16,225 --> 00:44:18,924
to break their whole model
'cause it lowered just enough,

1062
00:44:18,924 --> 00:44:21,433
the sales, where the
infrastructure costs of real estate

1063
00:44:21,433 --> 00:44:24,533
and all the things in the
real estate environment,

1064
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:27,555
fixtures and people broke the model,

1065
00:44:27,555 --> 00:44:29,996
so you don't need a lot
to stress the system.

1066
00:44:29,996 --> 00:44:32,048
Attention spans are tremendous

1067
00:44:32,048 --> 00:44:35,271
if you give people something
they want to watch.

1068
00:44:35,271 --> 00:44:38,379
I see people watching 47
minute videos on Facebook

1069
00:44:38,379 --> 00:44:40,449
and not watching six second videos.

1070
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:45,045
The quality of the content
is the differentiator,

1071
00:44:45,045 --> 00:44:46,295
not the length.

1072
00:44:49,299 --> 00:44:51,882
You want to pass it behind you?

1073
00:44:56,086 --> 00:44:56,932
How are you?

1074
00:44:56,932 --> 00:44:58,408
- I'm great and--
- Thank you.

1075
00:44:58,408 --> 00:44:59,400
- [Man] And thank you.

1076
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,005
Some of the things that you
said, absolutely eye-opening.

1077
00:45:02,005 --> 00:45:02,838
- [Gary] Like what?

1078
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:05,062
- [Man] So for example the concept like--

1079
00:45:05,062 --> 00:45:07,023
- [Gary] No really, I'm
curious, what hit you?

1080
00:45:07,023 --> 00:45:10,549
- [Man] The concept of
Facebook advertising

1081
00:45:10,549 --> 00:45:12,094
or using Facebook or B2B--

1082
00:45:12,094 --> 00:45:14,601
- It's like, right?
- To me was brand new.

1083
00:45:14,601 --> 00:45:16,329
- I get it.
- I've always thought about it

1084
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:19,609
as consumer-facing, it
used to be consumer-facing,

1085
00:45:19,609 --> 00:45:21,239
but from a B2B standpoint,

1086
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:23,838
it was a little bit eye-opening
for me and hopefully--

1087
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:25,262
- And I have some great news.

1088
00:45:25,262 --> 00:45:28,223
It's for you and everybody
else in the environment.

1089
00:45:28,223 --> 00:45:30,348
Most companies literally think it's better

1090
00:45:30,348 --> 00:45:33,334
to spend $47,000 on a
print ad in a B2B magazine

1091
00:45:33,334 --> 00:45:36,468
that nobody opens then
spend $10,000 to test

1092
00:45:36,468 --> 00:45:38,789
how Facebook could work for them.

1093
00:45:38,789 --> 00:45:41,206
Utter audacity, nothing else.

1094
00:45:42,416 --> 00:45:45,499
- [Man] So again, eye-opening for me.

1095
00:45:47,436 --> 00:45:51,766
Also, thank you for inviting
us to ask very basic questions.

1096
00:45:51,766 --> 00:45:53,667
So I'd actually appreciate
if you could elaborate

1097
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:57,834
a little bit more on an example
you gave of does your CEO--

1098
00:45:59,032 --> 00:46:00,131
- Let's talk about your business.

1099
00:46:00,131 --> 00:46:02,189
Who are you trying to reach?

1100
00:46:02,189 --> 00:46:04,482
- [Man] So we're a food
and greeting company.

1101
00:46:04,482 --> 00:46:06,399
- Okay.
- And so we have

1102
00:46:08,446 --> 00:46:11,807
manufacturers of food products.

1103
00:46:11,807 --> 00:46:14,210
For example, we have,

1104
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:18,809
we're developing some
very special ingredients.

1105
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,635
We'd probably love to be able to develop

1106
00:46:21,635 --> 00:46:24,911
some sort of Intel Inside type concept--

1107
00:46:24,911 --> 00:46:26,952
- Love that, I understand.

1108
00:46:26,952 --> 00:46:28,834
- [Man] We're a middle market company,

1109
00:46:28,834 --> 00:46:32,097
so our ability to spend
massive dollars to do that

1110
00:46:32,097 --> 00:46:33,959
as Intel can is not there.

1111
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:35,150
- Yes.

1112
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:37,004
- [Man] But the
concept-defining strategies

1113
00:46:37,004 --> 00:46:40,454
that can help us do that is fascinating.

1114
00:46:40,454 --> 00:46:42,747
- And they didn't have it either, right?

1115
00:46:42,747 --> 00:46:44,227
When you have the ingredient

1116
00:46:44,227 --> 00:46:47,015
that every consumer-facing
product is proud to put

1117
00:46:47,015 --> 00:46:49,839
on the front of their package,
they'll do it for you.

1118
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,348
Your problem is you need
to actually build a brand.

1119
00:46:53,348 --> 00:46:55,302
You need to make the, how many people

1120
00:46:55,302 --> 00:46:58,110
are aware of what happened
with the Dollar Shave Club?

1121
00:46:58,110 --> 00:46:59,508
I assume a lot of you are, right?

1122
00:46:59,508 --> 00:47:01,762
Raise your hands, I'm just
trying to get context.

1123
00:47:01,762 --> 00:47:04,110
So Dollar Shave Club made
a video that went viral

1124
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:06,086
and sold their company
for one billion dollars

1125
00:47:06,086 --> 00:47:07,248
in four years.

1126
00:47:07,248 --> 00:47:08,771
There's nothing else really there.

1127
00:47:08,771 --> 00:47:09,937
They did it, but by the way,

1128
00:47:09,937 --> 00:47:13,238
so did Nike with Just Do
It, and so did MasterCard

1129
00:47:13,238 --> 00:47:15,691
for a 15 year period with Priceless.

1130
00:47:15,691 --> 00:47:17,539
You make a video that we all get by it,

1131
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:19,218
Wendy's had a moment in the 80s,

1132
00:47:19,218 --> 00:47:20,730
it was called Where's The Beef?

1133
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:22,060
It works.

1134
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,263
The fact that you could
actually make a three minute,

1135
00:47:24,263 --> 00:47:26,804
13 second video of a mom and a daughter

1136
00:47:26,804 --> 00:47:29,001
and they have a healthier
life because of your product

1137
00:47:29,001 --> 00:47:30,638
and the other part of
the three minute video

1138
00:47:30,638 --> 00:47:32,863
showed if they had not had
your product, they wouldn't,

1139
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:35,055
and that just strikes a chord,

1140
00:47:35,055 --> 00:47:38,085
or the Ice Bucket Challenge,

1141
00:47:38,085 --> 00:47:41,504
the fact that you can spend
$100,000 to make a video

1142
00:47:41,504 --> 00:47:44,028
and another $50,000 to 100 to spend on ads

1143
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:47,904
against the potential demo
to create the groundswelling

1144
00:47:47,904 --> 00:47:49,989
to then drive back to
give you the leverage

1145
00:47:49,989 --> 00:47:52,029
with the consumer packaged good companies

1146
00:47:52,029 --> 00:47:55,157
so that they come to you
to put the greeting in

1147
00:47:55,157 --> 00:47:59,324
instead of you begging, whoever
asks gives up the leverage.

1148
00:48:00,819 --> 00:48:03,554
I can't believe we live in a
world where you have a chance

1149
00:48:03,554 --> 00:48:07,545
for that $200,000 to have
Procter and Gamble and Unilever

1150
00:48:07,545 --> 00:48:09,597
and Coca Cola actually reach out to you.

1151
00:48:09,597 --> 00:48:10,809
That is mind-boggling.

1152
00:48:10,809 --> 00:48:13,971
Now, I'm not here to sell fairy dust.

1153
00:48:13,971 --> 00:48:17,746
20 out of 21 of those efforts could lose,

1154
00:48:17,746 --> 00:48:19,303
but four may be singles.

1155
00:48:19,303 --> 00:48:21,257
Dollar Shave Club was a grand slam.

1156
00:48:21,257 --> 00:48:23,390
Four of those videos maybe singles.

1157
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:26,360
20 may be strikeouts, and then
you just wasted two million,

1158
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,752
this is practical, but
the fact that 10 of them

1159
00:48:29,752 --> 00:48:31,249
can be double, singles, triples,

1160
00:48:31,249 --> 00:48:33,644
and as we start getting
smarter about the creative

1161
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:37,238
that actually gets people to
watch, it's an incredible time

1162
00:48:37,238 --> 00:48:40,375
to be in business, you know?

1163
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:43,630
It is absolutely frightening,
like the gentleman said,

1164
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,033
but it's also unbelievably incredible.

1165
00:48:46,033 --> 00:48:49,328
You just can't hold on to
the romance of the strategies

1166
00:48:49,328 --> 00:48:53,058
and leverage that you had or
have or that you overpaid for

1167
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:56,954
just recently, it just
doesn't work that way,

1168
00:48:56,954 --> 00:48:58,683
that's why people go out of business.

1169
00:48:58,683 --> 00:49:03,201
So what I would do, if you're
trying to be Intel Inside,

1170
00:49:03,201 --> 00:49:05,108
you actually have to win consumer.

1171
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,719
So you have to make the emotional creative

1172
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:09,976
to get the Millennial mom
or the 50 year old male

1173
00:49:09,976 --> 00:49:12,847
or whoever your target demo
is to actually start demanding

1174
00:49:12,847 --> 00:49:15,151
or getting excited about this ingredient

1175
00:49:15,151 --> 00:49:16,785
that will make them live.

1176
00:49:16,785 --> 00:49:21,090
I'm super fascinated by cricket
protein for example, right?

1177
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:23,980
So I think I'm bullish on cricket protein,

1178
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,340
there's just a lot there,

1179
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,286
it's just a very easy
narrative for me to sell

1180
00:49:27,286 --> 00:49:28,973
and everything you just heard,

1181
00:49:28,973 --> 00:49:32,291
I just have to make people
excited about eating crickets.

1182
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:35,041
(crowd laughing)

1183
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,372
But you know what's more
difficult than that?

1184
00:49:39,372 --> 00:49:41,826
Convincing people 40 years
ago to pay for water,

1185
00:49:41,826 --> 00:49:43,409
'cause it was free.

1186
00:49:47,336 --> 00:49:48,552
So, that.

1187
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:51,460
And while it's four dollars to
get in front of 1,000 people

1188
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,043
and not 63, got it?

1189
00:49:54,942 --> 00:49:56,785
That's why I'm excited.

1190
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:59,573
That's what this energy
is, because I'm so thrilled

1191
00:49:59,573 --> 00:50:02,563
that 94% of this room is
gonna wake up in six years,

1192
00:50:02,563 --> 00:50:06,024
read an article how the
years of 2013 to 2018

1193
00:50:06,024 --> 00:50:08,845
were the best years to build on Facebook,

1194
00:50:08,845 --> 00:50:10,724
and all these big companies came out of it

1195
00:50:10,724 --> 00:50:13,273
and I want them to remember
this talk and be super pissed

1196
00:50:13,273 --> 00:50:14,823
they didn't listen to me.

1197
00:50:14,823 --> 00:50:17,294
(crowd laughing)

1198
00:50:17,294 --> 00:50:21,686
I mean it, historically
correct, that's my currency.

1199
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:24,009
- Thank you.
- You got it.

1200
00:50:24,009 --> 00:50:25,942
- [Woman] Looks like we
have another hand down--

1201
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:27,159
- Yeah, right next to you.

1202
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:29,483
And let, right side, what up?

1203
00:50:29,483 --> 00:50:32,780
(crowd laughing)
Let's get going over there.

1204
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,225
Somebody's got to step up for that side.

1205
00:50:35,225 --> 00:50:36,685
- [Ken] Hi, Ken Zuckerberg.

1206
00:50:36,685 --> 00:50:38,406
- Hey, Ken.
- Fascinating discussion.

1207
00:50:38,406 --> 00:50:39,296
- [Gary] Thank you.

1208
00:50:39,296 --> 00:50:42,295
- [Ken] Are we, since
this room has a lot of

1209
00:50:42,295 --> 00:50:44,897
sort of businesses that are traditional,

1210
00:50:44,897 --> 00:50:48,518
are we at the end of the
day talking about disruption

1211
00:50:48,518 --> 00:50:50,416
of distribution, the middleman?

1212
00:50:50,416 --> 00:50:51,675
- Yes, yes we are.
- I mean that's a key message

1213
00:50:51,675 --> 00:50:54,504
I got here, and I guess
if you could explain when

1214
00:50:54,504 --> 00:50:56,791
we have people that are
manufacturing product,

1215
00:50:56,791 --> 00:50:59,723
selling a traditional
channel to a consumer,

1216
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,843
obviously a lot of B2B,

1217
00:51:01,843 --> 00:51:05,207
how do you help the CEOs
and the senior managements

1218
00:51:05,207 --> 00:51:08,267
embrace this in a way that they can then

1219
00:51:08,267 --> 00:51:12,434
have the action rate at
95%, not 4% or 3% then?

1220
00:51:13,423 --> 00:51:14,965
- With the success of the creative?

1221
00:51:14,965 --> 00:51:16,468
- Yeah.
- You can't.

1222
00:51:16,468 --> 00:51:17,972
Which is what's so difficult, right?

1223
00:51:17,972 --> 00:51:20,495
Creative is the variable of
success and it's very difficult.

1224
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:21,687
I've been spending the last seven years

1225
00:51:21,687 --> 00:51:23,175
in trying to close the gap.

1226
00:51:23,175 --> 00:51:25,311
The way you can do it is
by driving down the cost

1227
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,886
of the creative.

1228
00:51:26,886 --> 00:51:30,757
If you have $500,000 to spend
and you only get one chance

1229
00:51:30,757 --> 00:51:33,575
to try, you'll lose, and
so what I've been doing

1230
00:51:33,575 --> 00:51:35,119
is building over the last seven years

1231
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,881
the ability to give you
11 at-bats for that price

1232
00:51:37,881 --> 00:51:40,548
at the same quality of just one.

1233
00:51:41,459 --> 00:51:45,121
- [Ken] So your thinking
is 10 standard deviations

1234
00:51:45,121 --> 00:51:46,462
quicker than most of us.

1235
00:51:46,462 --> 00:51:47,899
I mean, it's inspiring, it's terrific.

1236
00:51:47,899 --> 00:51:48,732
- Thank you.

1237
00:51:48,732 --> 00:51:49,613
- [Ken] When you bring it back to--

1238
00:51:49,613 --> 00:51:50,446
- Reality?

1239
00:51:50,446 --> 00:51:53,840
- [Ken] Reality, think
about a chemicals company,

1240
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,606
think about an ingredients company,

1241
00:51:55,606 --> 00:51:58,023
how do you make that initial,

1242
00:51:59,104 --> 00:52:00,771
how do you make that initial step?

1243
00:52:00,771 --> 00:52:02,620
And I--
- It's very simple.

1244
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,743
It's a religious step, right?

1245
00:52:04,743 --> 00:52:05,741
Or a functional step.

1246
00:52:05,741 --> 00:52:07,653
To your point, it's what
I've been fascinated by,

1247
00:52:07,653 --> 00:52:09,637
getting into bigger business environments,

1248
00:52:09,637 --> 00:52:12,409
coming from entrepreneurship
in Silicon Valley

1249
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:15,909
through radical things like firing the CEO

1250
00:52:17,132 --> 00:52:19,748
or scaring them or inspiring them.

1251
00:52:19,748 --> 00:52:21,471
You can't play in the middle.

1252
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,706
Or what really needs to happen,

1253
00:52:23,706 --> 00:52:27,706
which is changing the
way we incentivize them.

1254
00:52:27,706 --> 00:52:30,646
I can't blame you, I used to
be so mad at these people,

1255
00:52:30,646 --> 00:52:31,824
like, "You are such jerks,

1256
00:52:31,824 --> 00:52:33,960
"you just care about the
stock price being good

1257
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,298
"in three years so when you leave,

1258
00:52:35,298 --> 00:52:37,516
"you buy a yacht, you
piece of crap", right?

1259
00:52:37,516 --> 00:52:39,362
That's what I thought.

1260
00:52:39,362 --> 00:52:43,240
I still weirdly think that,
but I'm way more empathetic

1261
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,169
that the structure of the whole game

1262
00:52:45,169 --> 00:52:46,881
has put you in that position.

1263
00:52:46,881 --> 00:52:50,639
But here's the really
important part of the question.

1264
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:53,081
I have unbelievable empathy,

1265
00:52:53,081 --> 00:52:56,722
but what I try to remind
people on a one-to-one

1266
00:52:56,722 --> 00:52:58,976
who've really gotten to know
me, or in this environment is

1267
00:52:58,976 --> 00:53:01,871
it's going to happen, it's
happened, it's happening,

1268
00:53:01,871 --> 00:53:05,644
so why I'm so fascinated about marketing

1269
00:53:05,644 --> 00:53:06,935
is 'cause I know a lot of people here,

1270
00:53:06,935 --> 00:53:08,527
if they spend any money on marketing

1271
00:53:08,527 --> 00:53:10,829
are putting it directly in the garbage.

1272
00:53:10,829 --> 00:53:12,429
And so by taking it out of the garbage

1273
00:53:12,429 --> 00:53:14,659
and whether it's a $100,000 or $3 million,

1274
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:17,388
spending that right starts
giving people in here

1275
00:53:17,388 --> 00:53:21,172
the confidence of wait a
minute, why did that work?

1276
00:53:21,172 --> 00:53:22,327
And then you start building on it.

1277
00:53:22,327 --> 00:53:24,945
We've gone from places where
Ruby Tuesdays and Mondelez

1278
00:53:24,945 --> 00:53:28,144
where it went from being 1%
of the way they did things

1279
00:53:28,144 --> 00:53:32,187
to 40%, not 'cause they
liked me or I was charismatic

1280
00:53:32,187 --> 00:53:35,020
or I'm clever, because of results.

1281
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,487
So you try every different angle.

1282
00:53:39,487 --> 00:53:41,239
I've been in this B2B environment.

1283
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:45,494
91% of my clients don't do it
the way that I want them to.

1284
00:53:45,494 --> 00:53:48,256
I'm trying to be historically
correct, and more importantly,

1285
00:53:48,256 --> 00:53:49,800
my entire thesis as to why I'm buying,

1286
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,710
I'm building VaynerMedia to become

1287
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:54,291
a consumer packaged goods holding company.

1288
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:55,901
I want to build the
next Procter and Gamble

1289
00:53:55,901 --> 00:53:58,275
on the back of building the next WPP,

1290
00:53:58,275 --> 00:54:00,503
and I went in because I thought 3G

1291
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:02,472
was gonna be over compensated

1292
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:06,026
and heralded in the last decade,
which clearly, they have,

1293
00:54:06,026 --> 00:54:09,838
but you can only fire so many people.

1294
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:13,201
You have to build top-line
revenue and brand.

1295
00:54:13,201 --> 00:54:14,969
And so nobody's ever built the complement,

1296
00:54:14,969 --> 00:54:17,899
I am building the complement
for ever Carlisle and Bain

1297
00:54:17,899 --> 00:54:20,479
and Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman on earth,

1298
00:54:20,479 --> 00:54:24,275
I'm in the process of it,
which is why I can see this.

1299
00:54:24,275 --> 00:54:26,600
I'm being very patient,
I'm eating my own dog food

1300
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,942
that I'm trying to get you to,

1301
00:54:27,942 --> 00:54:29,936
which is run a marathon, not a sprint,

1302
00:54:29,936 --> 00:54:32,121
because you don't realize the sprint game

1303
00:54:32,121 --> 00:54:33,146
is not even gonna be in,

1304
00:54:33,146 --> 00:54:34,892
it's not gonna be in the Olympics anymore.

1305
00:54:34,892 --> 00:54:35,725
Do you understand?

1306
00:54:35,725 --> 00:54:36,780
That's the problem.

1307
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:39,522
And so how do you do it?

1308
00:54:39,522 --> 00:54:41,917
You suffocate them, right?

1309
00:54:41,917 --> 00:54:42,750
I mean it.

1310
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:46,229
You suffocate the decision
maker, through sheer will,

1311
00:54:46,229 --> 00:54:48,878
through frightening, through inspiring,

1312
00:54:48,878 --> 00:54:50,962
through data, I don't know,

1313
00:54:50,962 --> 00:54:54,045
but you have the actual conversation.

1314
00:54:56,871 --> 00:54:58,630
Let's get that dude
all the way over there.

1315
00:54:58,630 --> 00:54:59,463
He went far right.
- Oh yeah.

1316
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:02,213
Right side of the room.
- Love it.

1317
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:10,356
It's binary, right?

1318
00:55:10,356 --> 00:55:12,066
I can give you a million new, it's binary,

1319
00:55:12,066 --> 00:55:13,435
they either decide to do it or not,

1320
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,775
but marketing is the most movable thing.

1321
00:55:15,775 --> 00:55:20,042
(crowd member speaking quietly)

1322
00:55:20,042 --> 00:55:21,420
I'll repeat it for everybody.

1323
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:25,420
(crowd member speaking quietly)

1324
00:55:37,371 --> 00:55:40,998
My brother, I invested, I
bought Mark's parents shares

1325
00:55:40,998 --> 00:55:45,165
in 2008 on a discount on a
valuation that was $10 billion,

1326
00:55:46,025 --> 00:55:48,409
and I put every dollar
I had in liquid into it.

1327
00:55:48,409 --> 00:55:51,206
My financial advisor, my
parents, my contemporaries,

1328
00:55:51,206 --> 00:55:54,123
my mentors, they shit on me, right?

1329
00:55:55,963 --> 00:55:58,215
Next, it went public.

1330
00:55:58,215 --> 00:56:01,310
All my friends because I was
an early investor and advocate,

1331
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:03,619
all my friends that were
the top 100 employees there,

1332
00:56:03,619 --> 00:56:06,960
90% of them sold 90% of
their holdings between 12,

1333
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,074
excuse me, 19 and $40 a share,
depending on their timing.

1334
00:56:10,074 --> 00:56:12,185
Six month, you know?

1335
00:56:12,185 --> 00:56:15,269
I bought it in 2008, I
haven't sold one share.

1336
00:56:15,269 --> 00:56:17,165
I bought Twitter, back to your question,

1337
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,557
I never fully finished
answering it, why not Twitter?

1338
00:56:19,557 --> 00:56:22,609
I bought Twitter at the same time.

1339
00:56:22,609 --> 00:56:26,650
A $47,000 investment that
was worth $16 million to me,

1340
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:30,878
and I sold 90% of my holding
at $44, it's $20 now,

1341
00:56:30,878 --> 00:56:33,433
because I just day trade attention.

1342
00:56:33,433 --> 00:56:35,762
I'm not emotional.

1343
00:56:35,762 --> 00:56:36,595
The end.

1344
00:56:37,703 --> 00:56:38,947
You want to make a lot of money?

1345
00:56:38,947 --> 00:56:40,829
Put all your liquid
into Facebook and Amazon

1346
00:56:40,829 --> 00:56:42,845
that you can never touch.

1347
00:56:42,845 --> 00:56:45,597
As long as Jeff Bezos and
Mark Zuckerberg are alive

1348
00:56:45,597 --> 00:56:48,014
and running it, you will win.

1349
00:56:51,552 --> 00:56:54,052
Guys, this hasn't started yet.

1350
00:56:55,642 --> 00:56:58,570
The shrug is 'cause it hasn't started.

1351
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:00,339
I love how people think disruption,

1352
00:57:00,339 --> 00:57:03,580
everything you see being
disrupted right now,

1353
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,728
tier three auto.

1354
00:57:05,728 --> 00:57:09,919
How does a car dealership
survive in the 40-year macro

1355
00:57:09,919 --> 00:57:12,142
when Tesla goes direct to consumer?

1356
00:57:12,142 --> 00:57:14,963
Because the government and the
laws are gonna protect you?

1357
00:57:14,963 --> 00:57:16,046
For how long?

1358
00:57:17,396 --> 00:57:21,563
It's just naivete and
short-term thinking at scale.

1359
00:57:24,061 --> 00:57:27,061
- [Man] Thanks, it's been
eye-opening for me as well.

1360
00:57:27,061 --> 00:57:28,047
- [Gary] Thank you.

1361
00:57:28,047 --> 00:57:30,244
- [Man] You've talked a lot
about day trading attention

1362
00:57:30,244 --> 00:57:33,411
between B2B and B2C, but as a bank,

1363
00:57:33,411 --> 00:57:36,380
we're also sort of a
middleman, to a certain extent.

1364
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,639
- [Gary] You're in deep shit too.

1365
00:57:37,639 --> 00:57:40,431
(crowd laughing)
- So,

1366
00:57:40,431 --> 00:57:42,362
apart from hosting you at our conference

1367
00:57:42,362 --> 00:57:45,177
and being the keynote
speaker, what can we do?

1368
00:57:45,177 --> 00:57:47,650
- I think you need to look
things in the eye, right?

1369
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:49,535
You need to actually not say,

1370
00:57:49,535 --> 00:57:51,650
and you can't be in
conferences like this and say,

1371
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:54,002
in a more conservative
environment and say,

1372
00:57:54,002 --> 00:57:57,002
"Over the next 10 years
Amazon or Venmo or Blockchain

1373
00:57:57,002 --> 00:58:00,798
"are disruptive or
potentially disruptive",

1374
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:01,977
it's really no different,

1375
00:58:01,977 --> 00:58:04,131
it's gonna be the same answer
for everybody at that scale.

1376
00:58:04,131 --> 00:58:07,051
Banks have to realize
what their value prop is

1377
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:09,838
and how quickly it's being commoditized.

1378
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:12,383
And it's happening fast, right?

1379
00:58:12,383 --> 00:58:16,855
So I think it's about creating
new products and services.

1380
00:58:16,855 --> 00:58:18,466
I think it's about M and A activity

1381
00:58:18,466 --> 00:58:20,136
and grossly overpaying for things

1382
00:58:20,136 --> 00:58:21,663
that look like you're overpaying for them.

1383
00:58:21,663 --> 00:58:24,403
I was on CNN the day after
Facebook bought Instagram.

1384
00:58:24,403 --> 00:58:25,419
They paid a billion dollars.

1385
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:28,678
Instagram was 551 days
old and Piers Morgan goes,

1386
00:58:28,678 --> 00:58:30,647
"Okay Gary Vee, what do you think?"

1387
00:58:30,647 --> 00:58:32,126
And I go, "They stole it."

1388
00:58:32,126 --> 00:58:35,805
I get out of the studio in
Columbus Circle and 10,000 people

1389
00:58:35,805 --> 00:58:37,660
on Twitter tell me I'm an idiot

1390
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:38,774
because they'd never heard of it,

1391
00:58:38,774 --> 00:58:41,998
and a billion dollars sure
sounds like a lot of money.

1392
00:58:41,998 --> 00:58:44,198
By the way, side note, I
favorited every one of them

1393
00:58:44,198 --> 00:58:46,858
and two years later on a
trip to Turks and Caicos,

1394
00:58:46,858 --> 00:58:48,522
I went back and replied to all of them

1395
00:58:48,522 --> 00:58:49,908
and said, "Now what?"

1396
00:58:49,908 --> 00:58:51,965
(crowd laughing)

1397
00:58:51,965 --> 00:58:54,019
I think the biggest thing the
biggest companies here can do

1398
00:58:54,019 --> 00:58:57,000
is grossly overpay for the future,

1399
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,826
but they have to be right.

1400
00:58:59,826 --> 00:59:00,982
But that's what they need to do.

1401
00:59:00,982 --> 00:59:03,952
You need to buy up other services

1402
00:59:03,952 --> 00:59:05,279
if you believe what I believe.

1403
00:59:05,279 --> 00:59:07,252
And I could be wrong,
I've been wrong before,

1404
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:11,435
but the core of what a
bank does at its essence

1405
00:59:11,435 --> 00:59:12,971
is being disrupted very quickly.

1406
00:59:12,971 --> 00:59:15,900
You do not put Blockchain back in the bag.

1407
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,998
It may not happen,
Bitcoin could go to zero.

1408
00:59:18,998 --> 00:59:20,260
That's irrelevant.

1409
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,106
You have an entire
generation that understands

1410
00:59:22,106 --> 00:59:26,423
the decentralization of us
interacting with each other.

1411
00:59:26,423 --> 00:59:30,175
When you understand that
you are gonna close a house

1412
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:34,064
on Ethereum, between me and
you, and we will accept that,

1413
00:59:34,064 --> 00:59:36,136
it goes into a totally different place.

1414
00:59:36,136 --> 00:59:37,249
I think people are very naive.

1415
00:59:37,249 --> 00:59:40,916
They don't understand
how religion happened.

1416
00:59:42,817 --> 00:59:44,484
That's what I think.

1417
00:59:45,534 --> 00:59:47,009
Sir.

1418
00:59:47,009 --> 00:59:47,842
Yes.

1419
00:59:49,314 --> 00:59:51,228
- [Man] Yes, so I'm
gonna almond processor--

1420
00:59:51,228 --> 00:59:53,398
- [Gary] Oh, I'm sorry,
where's this coming from?

1421
00:59:53,398 --> 00:59:54,436
- Right here.
- Where?

1422
00:59:54,436 --> 00:59:56,263
- In the--
- Oh, hey sorry.

1423
00:59:56,263 --> 00:59:58,079
Okay, we'll do you quickly as well

1424
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,633
then we'll get out of here,
I don't want to run too late.

1425
00:59:59,633 --> 01:00:01,051
- [Man] We're an almond processing company

1426
01:00:01,051 --> 01:00:04,329
that exports to 70 different countries.

1427
01:00:04,329 --> 01:00:06,900
Do you expect Amazon to accept Bitcoin

1428
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,336
and how will that affect the marketplace?

1429
01:00:09,336 --> 01:00:14,225
- I believe cryptocurrencies
crossed over the chasm.

1430
01:00:14,225 --> 01:00:16,654
I expect China, Russia and America

1431
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,571
to have a whole lot of say on this issue

1432
01:00:18,571 --> 01:00:20,716
and I don't know how the
citizens in our world

1433
01:00:20,716 --> 01:00:21,903
will react to it.

1434
01:00:21,903 --> 01:00:23,236
So I don't know.

1435
01:00:24,534 --> 01:00:26,169
You know why I love what I do up here?

1436
01:00:26,169 --> 01:00:27,601
I don't guess.

1437
01:00:27,601 --> 01:00:30,071
Everything you've heard so far is fact.

1438
01:00:30,071 --> 01:00:31,500
You just don't see it.

1439
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,741
That's me guessing.

1440
01:00:32,741 --> 01:00:36,261
My intuition is Jeff
Bezos wants to dominate

1441
01:00:36,261 --> 01:00:37,513
at such a scale,

1442
01:00:37,513 --> 01:00:40,438
he has such internal ambition for legacy

1443
01:00:40,438 --> 01:00:42,870
that he'll go as hard
and as fast as he can

1444
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:44,505
at disrupting everybody

1445
01:00:44,505 --> 01:00:47,838
as long as the governments allow him to.

1446
01:00:48,734 --> 01:00:51,048
But you know this by playing in 70,

1447
01:00:51,048 --> 01:00:54,129
European DNA versus US DNA
versus China, you gotta,

1448
01:00:54,129 --> 01:00:56,042
you're gonna have fragmentation at scale.

1449
01:00:56,042 --> 01:00:58,683
Just like you've seen
from Google and Facebook,

1450
01:00:58,683 --> 01:01:00,629
everybody create closed gardens.

1451
01:01:00,629 --> 01:01:02,941
What do you think America's
trying to do right now?

1452
01:01:02,941 --> 01:01:04,217
And you're gonna see
some reactions to that,

1453
01:01:04,217 --> 01:01:06,489
so we have to figure that out.

1454
01:01:06,489 --> 01:01:07,702
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1455
01:01:07,702 --> 01:01:09,136
Sir?

1456
01:01:09,136 --> 01:01:11,667
- [Man] You talked about
the importance of brand.

1457
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:15,759
We've seen brands that were
icons that have tarnished

1458
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:17,700
and new brands come out of nowhere.

1459
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,047
What are the most
important values in a brand

1460
01:01:20,047 --> 01:01:21,861
that you look for or see?

1461
01:01:21,861 --> 01:01:23,749
- The biggest reason big
brands get tarnished,

1462
01:01:23,749 --> 01:01:26,948
AKA, irrelevant, is 'cause they take money

1463
01:01:26,948 --> 01:01:29,907
and put it directly in the garbage, right?

1464
01:01:29,907 --> 01:01:31,751
The reason the biggest
brands are losing right now

1465
01:01:31,751 --> 01:01:33,863
is 'cause they think
running television ads

1466
01:01:33,863 --> 01:01:36,593
is worth their 70% of the
allocation of their money.

1467
01:01:36,593 --> 01:01:37,735
The end.

1468
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:38,767
This is historical.

1469
01:01:38,767 --> 01:01:40,623
You want to really learn
something if you're a nerd?

1470
01:01:40,623 --> 01:01:42,809
Go look what happened in
the late 40s and early 50s

1471
01:01:42,809 --> 01:01:45,762
when we transitioned from
a primary radio society

1472
01:01:45,762 --> 01:01:47,630
to a primary television society.

1473
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:51,297
The biggest brands in
the world died, right?

1474
01:01:52,505 --> 01:01:54,069
Because they went to the club

1475
01:01:54,069 --> 01:01:56,819
with the guy that sold him radio.

1476
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:01,376
Misjudging where people
are paying attention,

1477
01:02:01,376 --> 01:02:04,043
this keynote has content, right?

1478
01:02:04,949 --> 01:02:07,525
Whether you like this or
not, this was content.

1479
01:02:07,525 --> 01:02:10,021
If nobody was in this hall right now,

1480
01:02:10,021 --> 01:02:13,096
it would have been a bad use of my time.

1481
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:14,588
That's how brands lose.

1482
01:02:14,588 --> 01:02:16,530
And there's another part.

1483
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:18,219
They become vulnerable to the person

1484
01:02:18,219 --> 01:02:21,006
that's closest to the consumer.

1485
01:02:21,006 --> 01:02:24,433
In 1982, the biggest supermarkets

1486
01:02:24,433 --> 01:02:26,472
and super stores in this country

1487
01:02:26,472 --> 01:02:29,119
basically got zero trade dollars

1488
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,798
from the biggest brands in the world.

1489
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:32,995
And Pillsbury and Kellogg's
and everybody else

1490
01:02:32,995 --> 01:02:35,180
was able to spend all
their money on marketing.

1491
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:39,049
As Walmart and Albertsons
and Publix got smarter

1492
01:02:39,049 --> 01:02:41,589
and started making people
pay for shelf space,

1493
01:02:41,589 --> 01:02:44,678
support their internal ad
networks and everything else,

1494
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:47,524
they started taking money
out of the suppliers

1495
01:02:47,524 --> 01:02:49,356
and putting it into their own pockets.

1496
01:02:49,356 --> 01:02:51,373
And then it became a drug,

1497
01:02:51,373 --> 01:02:53,481
because it was great for short-term sales,

1498
01:02:53,481 --> 01:02:55,216
and then they took that drug money

1499
01:02:55,216 --> 01:02:56,856
and started creating private labels

1500
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:59,528
and commoditized the biggest
brands out of the world,

1501
01:02:59,528 --> 01:03:01,517
while then the biggest brands in the world

1502
01:03:01,517 --> 01:03:03,525
still spent money on television

1503
01:03:03,525 --> 01:03:05,681
because the biggest media
companies in the world

1504
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:07,631
push television down their throat

1505
01:03:07,631 --> 01:03:10,132
with bullshit metrics
from Nielsen's and others

1506
01:03:10,132 --> 01:03:11,398
because that's where the margin is

1507
01:03:11,398 --> 01:03:13,850
for the biggest holding
companies in the media world,

1508
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:16,995
leaving brands like Pillsbury Doughboy

1509
01:03:16,995 --> 01:03:19,745
and Tony the Tiger left for dead.

1510
01:03:22,034 --> 01:03:23,207
Got it?

1511
01:03:23,207 --> 01:03:25,332
(crowd laughing)

1512
01:03:25,332 --> 01:03:28,826
Thank you.
(crowd applauding)

1513
01:03:28,826 --> 01:03:29,659
Thank you.

1514
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:32,421
Let's end it with this.

1515
01:03:32,421 --> 01:03:34,425
Who are you sending this keynote to?
