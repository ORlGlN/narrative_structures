1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:01,863
- Gotta pee.

2
00:00:01,863 --> 00:00:02,696
- What?

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,013
- You want to go pee real quick, now?

4
00:00:05,013 --> 00:00:07,094
- I'm gonna hold it in.

5
00:00:07,094 --> 00:00:08,632
- For real?

6
00:00:08,632 --> 00:00:10,364
- That should be how you actually start

7
00:00:10,364 --> 00:00:11,752
the episode that way.

8
00:00:11,752 --> 00:00:14,173
♫ Me and Gary Vee up in the office

9
00:00:14,173 --> 00:00:16,560
♫ Do rag flappin'
walkin' through corporate

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,753
♫ Talks about all this shit been leveraged

11
00:00:18,753 --> 00:00:22,920
♫ 1,800 texts and shout out the beverage

12
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:29,866
- [Gary] All right, let's do this again.

13
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:34,053
Now this time, we're
gonna, oh there's AJ, AJV.

14
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:35,354
You gonna call?

15
00:00:35,354 --> 00:00:37,604
AJ on a Vayner sports call.

16
00:00:39,212 --> 00:00:40,939
That was exciting.

17
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:42,800
Always good to see my bro.

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,481
All right let's go downstairs.

19
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:47,834
Downstairs is where Pure Wow is.

20
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:52,031
If you're not subscribe
to purwow.com right now.

21
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:56,198
Taylor, can you put the link
right here for purewow.com?

22
00:00:57,338 --> 00:00:59,481
That is where this is.

23
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:00,314
Hey!

24
00:01:01,246 --> 00:01:02,117
- Hey, how are you?

25
00:01:02,117 --> 00:01:03,105
- I'm super well, how are you?
- Good.

26
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,310
- [Gary] Good.

27
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,385
- You're filming?

28
00:01:05,385 --> 00:01:06,764
- [Gary] Yeah, I'm just
doing a little filming.

29
00:01:06,764 --> 00:01:08,231
Fuck it, why not.

30
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:10,998
Let's see what's going on down here.

31
00:01:10,998 --> 00:01:13,248
That's Pure Wow over there.

32
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:15,921
Hey, Lisa Buckley!

33
00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:16,754
- Hi!

34
00:01:16,754 --> 00:01:17,587
- [Gary] How are you?

35
00:01:17,587 --> 00:01:18,420
- Good, good, how are you?

36
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,253
- [Gary] Well?

37
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:20,086
I'm super well, hey dude.

38
00:01:20,086 --> 00:01:23,774
Wow, you're hair is
legit, I really like that.

39
00:01:23,774 --> 00:01:24,831
- [Man] What's up, Gary?

40
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:25,902
- [Gary] What's up, man.

41
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:26,873
You guys like his hair?

42
00:01:26,873 --> 00:01:28,143
(laughing)

43
00:01:28,143 --> 00:01:29,092
I like it.

44
00:01:29,092 --> 00:01:30,035
Hey, man, how are you?

45
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:30,868
- Hi.
- Hi.

46
00:01:35,994 --> 00:01:37,411
This is Pure Wow.

47
00:01:39,204 --> 00:01:42,154
Just show you something really quick.

48
00:01:42,154 --> 00:01:46,325
This Ryan Harwood when
he was 30 pounds lighter,

49
00:01:46,325 --> 00:01:50,688
but he's still a CEO,
so it didn't affect him.

50
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:52,802
The extra weight didn't
affect him and his ability

51
00:01:52,802 --> 00:01:55,799
to be the CEO of Pure Wow.

52
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,879
We are, rare opportunity where
DRock or Iris or Justin are

53
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,042
not around, and I'm in
the office by myself.

54
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:05,324
So, let's get a little bit of a tour.

55
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:08,102
This is the Quiet Riot
room, for all you '80s kids.

56
00:02:08,102 --> 00:02:09,940
There's Quiet Riot.

57
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,088
That's it.

58
00:02:11,088 --> 00:02:13,109
There's a couple, I don't
know what the hell is going

59
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:14,230
in here now.

60
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,604
There used to be a big ass table here,

61
00:02:15,604 --> 00:02:17,799
but something's going on.

62
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:20,382
Let's see what's going on here.

63
00:02:21,763 --> 00:02:23,744
- Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.

64
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:24,913
Hey!
- That's right, Shirley.

65
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:26,405
Glad I caught that.

66
00:02:26,405 --> 00:02:27,238
- [Shirley] Hey, great.

67
00:02:27,238 --> 00:02:28,453
- Amazing, hey.

68
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:32,950
Make sure that's huge
and everybody sees it.

69
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,547
- And I beat everybody.

70
00:02:34,547 --> 00:02:35,623
I don't know.

71
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:39,790
♫ They say you don't gotta go
home but you can't stay here

72
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:44,961
♫ And though I don't wanna be
alone in the world out there

73
00:02:46,074 --> 00:02:48,251
- Let me actually show
you around a little bit,

74
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,084
since the first time you're here.

75
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:49,947
And then we'll come back.

76
00:02:49,947 --> 00:02:54,114
♫ They say you don't gotta go
home but you can't stay here

77
00:02:55,728 --> 00:02:57,899
♫ And though I don't wanna be alone

78
00:02:57,899 --> 00:02:59,116
- It's right here.

79
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:02,718
♫ In the world out there

80
00:03:02,718 --> 00:03:06,885
♫ They say you don't gotta go
home but you can't stay here

81
00:03:09,837 --> 00:03:14,004
♫ And though I don't wanna be
alone in the world out there

82
00:03:16,844 --> 00:03:18,378
♫ They say you don't gotta go home

83
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:21,878
- I have one skill.
- I like your approach.

84
00:03:24,312 --> 00:03:26,729
- I really understand people.

85
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:32,605
In my will, in my active
will, it says if the human

86
00:03:33,977 --> 00:03:36,711
race figures out how to
measure emotional intelligence

87
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:38,211
I wanna be scored.

88
00:03:41,251 --> 00:03:45,418
That's how deeply I feel it
came to me at a genius level,

89
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:49,822
but we don't talk about that.

90
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:53,337
The only people that make the
move care about one thing.

91
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:54,848
Legacy.

92
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:57,652
If you do not care about
legacy, you don't trade

93
00:03:57,652 --> 00:03:59,316
on this moment in time.

94
00:03:59,316 --> 00:04:00,566
Andy?

95
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:02,085
Babbin?

96
00:04:02,085 --> 00:04:02,918
DRock?

97
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,526
I've got it figured out.

98
00:04:05,526 --> 00:04:08,609
(upbeat piano music)

99
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:16,752
- Here, I'm gonna sit.
- Hi!

100
00:04:16,752 --> 00:04:17,927
- Sounds awesome.

101
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:20,658
The practicality of
I'm gonna learn a craft

102
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:23,426
this summer is ludicrous,
'cause there's too many things

103
00:04:23,426 --> 00:04:25,640
that are not in control of
that being the situation,

104
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,222
hence why I think it's
about the people, and plus,

105
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:31,202
in reality, anything you
would learn in six or eight

106
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:34,599
or 10 weeks, you're gonna
learn in the first 90 days

107
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:35,588
of a job.

108
00:04:35,588 --> 00:04:37,161
At this point, where you're
questioning everything

109
00:04:37,161 --> 00:04:39,254
and so many of you are still in that place

110
00:04:39,254 --> 00:04:41,687
where you're just checking
the box of what the right

111
00:04:41,687 --> 00:04:44,431
thing to do is, because
that's how you've been trained

112
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:47,207
for the last 20 years of
your life, this is exactly

113
00:04:47,207 --> 00:04:50,103
the time to start debating it, for real.

114
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:52,647
Because you wake up and
you're 32 real quick.

115
00:04:52,647 --> 00:04:54,897
(laughing)

116
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,900
Right?

117
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,286
This is Eric Castner.

118
00:05:01,286 --> 00:05:02,572
He helped me build Wine Library.

119
00:05:02,572 --> 00:05:06,400
We were just sitting in a
small cubical five seconds ago,

120
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,204
building this website,
so it happens real quick.

121
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:12,189
- [Woman] How do you stay
focused on your own path

122
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:15,017
and success without comparing
yourself to other people

123
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:17,331
or not listening to anybody
else's opinion of you?

124
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:18,556
- I don't know.

125
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:20,958
Combination of being an immigrant
and having a ridiculously

126
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,168
big time mom.

127
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:23,004
Because I don't.

128
00:05:23,004 --> 00:05:24,357
And it's so real.

129
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:28,144
I really wish you could have it, too.

130
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:30,147
God, confidence, right?

131
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:31,413
Just not wavering.

132
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:33,770
Just fundamentally not caring
about what anybody else thinks

133
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,791
or feeling that anybody else
is impacting me besides myself.

134
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,492
But that's what I will do to the end.

135
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:40,139
So.

136
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,258
Thanks, guys.

137
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,091
Thanks, everyone.

138
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,038
(clapping)

139
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:43,871
- How are you?

140
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:44,706
- Really good, how are you, my friend?

141
00:05:44,706 --> 00:05:45,539
Real pleasure.

142
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,933
- I was the first black stand-up
comedian in South Africa.

143
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:49,251
- [Gary] Really?

144
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:51,001
- About 19 years ago.

145
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,761
Almost every black comic from
South Africa, I found them,

146
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:57,013
or I put them on my show.

147
00:05:57,013 --> 00:05:59,383
I've got a show called The
Blacks Only Comedy Show

148
00:05:59,383 --> 00:06:02,185
which has been going
on for about 13 years.

149
00:06:02,185 --> 00:06:03,113
- [Gary] Incredible.

150
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,899
- So coming here now, it's a bit like--

151
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:05,991
- [Gary] It's fun, I get--

152
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,983
- I can just book a theater,
but then, I'm not gonna be

153
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:10,285
part of the system--

154
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:11,135
- [Gary] I got it, I got it.

155
00:06:11,135 --> 00:06:12,513
- I kinda need to get into that--

156
00:06:12,513 --> 00:06:13,541
- [Gary] Social.

157
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,374
- Yeah.

158
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,207
- Fast.
- Yeah.

159
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:16,464
- You know what you need to do?

160
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:18,518
You need to call in every favor.

161
00:06:18,518 --> 00:06:21,524
If you take a picture
every single goddamn day,

162
00:06:21,524 --> 00:06:24,868
with some comedian who has
10,000, 50,000, 100,000,

163
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:28,086
40,000, five million, 100,000, a million.

164
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:32,093
If you just do it
everyday, it will matter.

165
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:35,432
And then, if you, in between
that, make good content,

166
00:06:35,432 --> 00:06:37,602
you're on your way.

167
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:39,735
And that part comes easy
to you, 'cause you're

168
00:06:39,735 --> 00:06:40,848
a successful comedian.

169
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:43,515
(hip hop music)

170
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,002
- Thanks for making happen.

171
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:48,456
I mean I would've done anything.

172
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:51,022
Thanks, man.
- No doubt.

173
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:51,855
- Real pleasure.
- Thank you so much.

174
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:52,688
- Let's stay in touch.

175
00:06:52,688 --> 00:06:53,855
DM me anytime.

176
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:59,289
- [Man] This is the fire from (mumbling).

177
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:00,408
- Love it.

178
00:07:00,408 --> 00:07:01,246
Hi.

179
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:02,808
- Hi, I'm Jordan, nice to meet you.

180
00:07:02,808 --> 00:07:03,799
- Jordan, I'm Gary, nice to meet you.

181
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:04,709
- Hey Gary.

182
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:05,542
Good to see you.
- Good to see you again.

183
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:06,375
How are you?
- I've heard so much

184
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,208
about you.
- I'm good, man.

185
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,041
- Good man.

186
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,666
- The coolest thing about your
impact on the world right now

187
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,891
and I said it in the email
is that here's a guy,

188
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:14,279
23 years of school, three
graduate degree, right?

189
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,362
Orthodontist.

190
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:18,918
As pro-school as there is out
there, telling his daughter

191
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:21,465
when she comes back from a
week-long program in Louisville

192
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:23,637
to figure out what your
future is, she somebody speak

193
00:07:23,637 --> 00:07:25,216
about social media
branding, and I say to her,

194
00:07:25,216 --> 00:07:27,510
if social media branding is what you want,

195
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,569
and that's where you wanna go, intern.

196
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:30,958
Go somewhere and learn the business.

197
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,131
Don't go to college.

198
00:07:32,131 --> 00:07:34,409
And she's fighting me,
I wanna go to college.

199
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:35,940
And I'm like, you're not going to college.

200
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,773
(laughing)

201
00:07:36,773 --> 00:07:37,905
- It's like this bizarro world.

202
00:07:37,905 --> 00:07:40,237
She's like, Dad, college is fun.

203
00:07:40,237 --> 00:07:41,585
- Yes, that's what I said.

204
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:42,874
- She's like I want a sorority.

205
00:07:42,874 --> 00:07:44,129
So, I'm like, I'm gonna go
find a bunch of good looking

206
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,131
girls, pay them money to take you--

207
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,054
- To hang out?

208
00:07:46,054 --> 00:07:47,212
I love it.

209
00:07:47,212 --> 00:07:50,314
- That's like a hashtag,
like the Gary Vee affect.

210
00:07:50,314 --> 00:07:52,340
- But you know what's funny
about that, or she could do

211
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,438
college the way I did,
which is actually understand

212
00:07:54,438 --> 00:07:57,530
that truth, have fun in her
sorority, what have you,

213
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,359
but in the time that
would've been study hours,

214
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:02,373
hone her craft.

215
00:08:02,373 --> 00:08:06,396
She could kind of go to
college and, there's a version,

216
00:08:06,396 --> 00:08:09,012
you've gotta go to a shitty
enough college, this is

217
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:11,238
just the truth, where you
can actually have a job,

218
00:08:11,238 --> 00:08:13,071
and have college life.

219
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,640
Like some colleges will kick
you outta school, right?

220
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,024
Some won't.

221
00:08:18,024 --> 00:08:19,120
I went there.

222
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,285
(laughing)

223
00:08:20,285 --> 00:08:22,909
Like I literally went to
four classes in my life.

224
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:26,320
- So, the key is she needs to
go to a shitty enough college.

225
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,374
- Shitty enough college
that you can still get

226
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,645
the college experience,
but you have eight hours

227
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:35,121
a day to actually work on
the, you could have four years

228
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:36,825
of getting great at social
by literally working.

229
00:08:36,826 --> 00:08:39,100
If you go to Ohio State,
working at some Columbus, Ohio,

230
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,472
small agency, like nine to
five, should be going to class.

231
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:44,215
Now, Ohio State will probably
kick you out, but this is

232
00:08:44,216 --> 00:08:45,787
literally my thesis on this.

233
00:08:45,787 --> 00:08:47,918
- This is like one of those
millions of conversations

234
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:49,748
that now you've created
in homes that didn't exist

235
00:08:49,748 --> 00:08:51,653
before you--
- I get it, man.

236
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:52,540
I get it.

237
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,947
- It was weird, I never
though my dad would say--

238
00:08:54,947 --> 00:08:55,780
- [Gary] You were like, what
are you talking about, Dad.

239
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,613
- And I was a crappy student.

240
00:08:56,613 --> 00:08:57,446
- [Gary] And where are you, now?

241
00:08:57,446 --> 00:08:59,061
Like a sophomore, junior?

242
00:08:59,061 --> 00:09:00,050
Where are you in high school?

243
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:00,946
- I'm gonna be a senior.
- You're gonna be a senior?

244
00:09:00,946 --> 00:09:01,779
- Yeah.

245
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:02,612
♫ I'm gonna be a legend

246
00:09:02,612 --> 00:09:03,989
♫ I'm gonna be a Jonny to your daddy

247
00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:05,690
♫ Outside news

248
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,529
♫ Ordinary people
staying going going crazy

249
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:09,170
♫ For an outlier

250
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,344
♫ I'm gonna kiss ya like you busy missy

251
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:13,089
♫ Be my cherry putting out fires

252
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:15,169
♫ See, I ain't never running from a rebel

253
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:17,194
♫ Only if I got my cramp under

254
00:09:17,194 --> 00:09:19,265
♫ Minor is my word

255
00:09:19,265 --> 00:09:20,992
♫ My bark is my bite, girl

256
00:09:20,992 --> 00:09:22,999
♫ My co-world, my lips, girl

257
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:25,039
♫ Love your curl, love your words

258
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,041
♫ Seein' as I'm leaving now or later

259
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,919
♫ Love me longer, longer for you my dear

260
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,966
♫ Bein' we believin', I'm lay awakin'

261
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:32,715
♫ Even when I didn't, baby I swear

262
00:09:32,715 --> 00:09:35,999
- Bottom line is we've
really figured it out.

263
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,355
Like I really know what to do.

264
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:39,722
You could become unbelievably
recognized every time

265
00:09:39,722 --> 00:09:42,366
you walk around Portland, in
a way that would stun you.

266
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:44,005
I don't know what else to say.

267
00:09:44,005 --> 00:09:46,426
It's basically, think of
it more like Lucille Ball

268
00:09:46,426 --> 00:09:49,268
and Bob Hope, when radio
went to television,

269
00:09:49,268 --> 00:09:51,678
the world still thought
a radio star was bigger

270
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:53,543
than a television star,
but it wasn't true.

271
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:56,179
And it took about a decade
for people to be like fuck.

272
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,886
That's basically.

273
00:09:57,886 --> 00:10:01,559
Logan and Jake Paul are
way more famous to anybody

274
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,640
under 25 than virtually every
other person you can name.

275
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,260
That's it.

276
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,210
- You think about it?

277
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,118
I just saw a headline said one
piece of content can change

278
00:10:09,118 --> 00:10:10,851
it all, no seriously.

279
00:10:10,851 --> 00:10:13,499
Tim Ferris wrote one book
that literally launched

280
00:10:13,499 --> 00:10:14,489
the entire career.

281
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,023
You've got two or three videos--

282
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:19,134
- Even better, bro, even
better, bro, to your point,

283
00:10:19,134 --> 00:10:23,130
that keynote I gave at the
Javits Center at Web 2.0,

284
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,875
then went on YouTube on TED
Talk, changed my career.

285
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,396
- Yeah.

286
00:10:27,396 --> 00:10:28,264
- Led to Crush It.

287
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:29,212
You know, it's one piece of content.

288
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:33,659
But if you have brand equity,
but if you have brand equity,

289
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:34,954
you will be fine.

290
00:10:34,954 --> 00:10:36,841
There is never a bad
time when you believe,

291
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:39,042
when you work hard and when
you know what you're doing.

292
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:41,860
But you have to do, this
is where it's crucial,

293
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,286
you have to do what you love, because let

294
00:10:44,286 --> 00:10:45,517
me tell you something.

295
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:47,890
It gets tough, but if you
love it, you will win.

296
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,755
The only way to succeed now is
to be completely transparent.

297
00:10:51,755 --> 00:10:53,270
Completely.

298
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,576
Everything is exposed, everything you do.

299
00:10:55,576 --> 00:10:58,512
So, your legacy is your ultimate life.

300
00:10:58,512 --> 00:11:01,011
It's all you've got, and you
can build so much on that.

301
00:11:01,011 --> 00:11:03,255
When you have brand equity,
anything can happen.

302
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:06,319
Written word, audio, video, pictures.

303
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:10,173
Four forms of communication
have the ability to do 'em all.

304
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:13,482
I mean, it's the best job on earth.

305
00:11:13,482 --> 00:11:15,625
It's literally what every single
14 year old on earth wants

306
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,964
to either be a YouTube
star or an influencer.

307
00:11:17,964 --> 00:11:20,477
Like why wouldn't you live
your life and make money?

308
00:11:20,477 --> 00:11:22,114
These are fuckin' hot!

309
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,364
I have so many cool sneaks.

310
00:11:29,463 --> 00:11:31,347
Who's a 10 1/2 around here?

311
00:11:31,347 --> 00:11:32,444
Who?

312
00:11:32,444 --> 00:11:33,277
(mumbling)

313
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:34,110
You are?

314
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,443
(rustling and chatting)

315
00:11:39,888 --> 00:11:40,721
I don't think I'll wear these.

316
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:41,554
You want these?

317
00:11:41,554 --> 00:11:42,659
Bang.

318
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:43,569
You're a 10 1/2?

319
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:44,543
- [Man] No.

320
00:11:44,543 --> 00:11:45,818
- What are you big, you a 12?

321
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:47,353
Yeah, I got it, I nailed it, I nailed it.

322
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:49,208
I'm good at guessing people's shoe size.

323
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,623
That's a random skill that
people don't realize I have.

324
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:54,492
Oh, so you're really
trying to be a winner?

325
00:11:54,492 --> 00:11:55,501
- Yes.

326
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:56,435
- I'm proud of you, man.

327
00:11:56,435 --> 00:11:57,268
- So you go in here--

328
00:11:57,268 --> 00:11:59,101
- This is fuckin' rad.

329
00:12:00,098 --> 00:12:03,705
So, why don't we take it,
don't spend the money so fast.

330
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:06,323
For example, that, we
should take two interns,

331
00:12:06,323 --> 00:12:09,382
literally just DM every
single fuckin' Facebook

332
00:12:09,382 --> 00:12:12,535
culture page and pay
them just to share it.

333
00:12:12,535 --> 00:12:14,057
- Yeah.

334
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:18,994
- What need to do is
replicate something, starting

335
00:12:18,994 --> 00:12:21,656
with Vayner, this is
back to my intern idea.

336
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:23,750
We need to have a slush fund of people.

337
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,516
The way I roll, the right
model is there's five

338
00:12:26,516 --> 00:12:29,492
guys and girls on our team
that actually don't have

339
00:12:29,492 --> 00:12:31,854
anything to do other than
the thing of the moment

340
00:12:31,854 --> 00:12:33,542
until I take them off
the thing of the moment.

341
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:37,726
Like right now, if I had
four people, think about who

342
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:38,710
they have to be.

343
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,577
They have to be more
of our cloth, which is,

344
00:12:40,577 --> 00:12:42,546
they have to be completely,
utterly not fancy

345
00:12:42,546 --> 00:12:44,754
and have to be willing
to eat shit and be like,

346
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:47,574
for example, back in the
day, when me and AJ launched

347
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:49,915
prelees dress me, the
search engine, the tshirt

348
00:12:49,915 --> 00:12:53,900
search engine, the best
thing I did, the thing I was

349
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,575
most fun was staying up to
five in the morning DMing

350
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,107
people or whatever that was at the time.

351
00:12:58,107 --> 00:12:59,391
Email blogs randomly.

352
00:12:59,391 --> 00:13:03,558
I think it's cool to now, I'm
gonna weirdly start sending,

353
00:13:04,556 --> 00:13:08,398
once Z's up to date,
Tyler's gonna, I think it's,

354
00:13:08,398 --> 00:13:10,716
and I don't care who does it...

355
00:13:10,716 --> 00:13:13,378
To me, nothing's smarter
right now than spending

356
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:18,278
15 hours messaging every
Facebook that has a million

357
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:20,695
followers that's a culture
page and be like hey,

358
00:13:20,695 --> 00:13:22,552
we have a video we'd like you to share.

359
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,661
How much?

360
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:25,852
Control C, Control V, listen
to your favorite fuckin'

361
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:28,737
album 50, like I can't wait
for my vacation in August

362
00:13:28,737 --> 00:13:30,174
to do that.

363
00:13:30,174 --> 00:13:33,594
I just wanna remind you guys
that that's probably why

364
00:13:33,594 --> 00:13:35,886
my Instagram and podcast
work, 'cause I went

365
00:13:35,886 --> 00:13:37,830
on vacation, did that a
little bit and was like

366
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,714
this is what we.

367
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:41,388
We need to figure out how
to hire and how to frame up

368
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,760
for people to realize
that's the best thing to do,

369
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,458
not oh, wait a minute,
I'm a film maker or I'm a

370
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,432
business development, or
like you know what I mean?

371
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:52,652
We need unbelievable amounts of humility

372
00:13:52,652 --> 00:13:56,509
to get done the kind of
things I most believe in,

373
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:59,118
'cause what I most believe in
is all these people right now,

374
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:01,674
I just want to basically
DM people on Facebook.

375
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,570
This is Gary Vay-ner-chuk,
and this is episode 260

376
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,062
of the Ask Gary Vee Show.

377
00:14:08,062 --> 00:14:09,979
And I'm super fired up.

378
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,836
All right, Linda, tell
everybody who you are.

379
00:14:12,836 --> 00:14:13,886
- [Linda] All right, the two cents.

380
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,855
Here's the two cents.
- Three cents.

381
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,688
- Three cents, okay.
- Legends get three cents.

382
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:19,120
- Okay, nobody has hosted
more Sports Centers than me

383
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,953
on ESPN.
- Okay, hold on.

384
00:14:19,953 --> 00:14:20,976
Let's just say that one more time.

385
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:23,604
- All right, nobody, male
or female, has hosted more

386
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:26,210
Sports Centers on ESPN
than me, Linda Cohn.

387
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,305
All right.

388
00:14:27,305 --> 00:14:29,194
- Thank you so much.
- All right, Gary.

389
00:14:29,194 --> 00:14:32,134
- You keep asking question,
we'll keep answering them.

390
00:14:32,134 --> 00:14:34,443
- [Linda] Awesome.

391
00:14:34,443 --> 00:14:37,110
- On this episode, LFC stops by!

392
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:39,740
You have a good day?

393
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,914
- Oh, hell yeah.

394
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,819
- [Man] An hour and a half might work.

395
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:45,319
- Bye.
- Bye, Gary.

396
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,242
- Good?

397
00:14:47,242 --> 00:14:48,825
- [Man] Good, Gary!

398
00:14:49,930 --> 00:00:00,000
