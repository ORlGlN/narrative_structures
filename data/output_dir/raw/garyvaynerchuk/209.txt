1
00:00:02,738 --> 00:00:05,655
(background noise)

2
00:00:10,832 --> 00:00:13,038
- You may be thinking
that I'm watching the show

3
00:00:13,038 --> 00:00:14,513
but what I'm doing what I always do,

4
00:00:14,513 --> 00:00:18,166
which is I'm reading
your comments on YouTube.

5
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:21,034
I've said it for all the
new ones that are here

6
00:00:21,034 --> 00:00:22,452
the comments are my oxygen.

7
00:00:22,452 --> 00:00:25,361
I don't think people
understand how much qualitative

8
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:29,340
feedback you get from
comments, reading comments,

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,938
watching the explore pages,
looking at how you guys

10
00:00:33,938 --> 00:00:36,336
respond to my stuff and others.

11
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:40,171
There's so many hours of consumption.

12
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:44,314
This is where I don't
consume shows and things

13
00:00:44,314 --> 00:00:48,123
of that nature because
I spend so much time

14
00:00:48,123 --> 00:00:50,298
reading, reading,
reading, reading, reading

15
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:51,289
your feedback.

16
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:54,856
As a collective, I consume
you guys more than you

17
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:56,206
consume me.

18
00:00:56,206 --> 00:00:59,843
And so, I just highly
recommend when you have a small

19
00:00:59,843 --> 00:01:02,154
audience you read every
one of those comments,

20
00:01:02,154 --> 00:01:04,382
you engage with every
one of those comments,

21
00:01:04,382 --> 00:01:05,834
brick by brick by brick

22
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:07,156
eventually you can't reply to everybody

23
00:01:07,156 --> 00:01:09,781
but you can always read a lot.

24
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:14,666
I mean I read, I'm just
reading all these comments.

25
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:17,908
- [Video Audio] About helping
everybody get good at it,

26
00:01:17,908 --> 00:01:21,173
not she or he is insecure
and it creates a moat around

27
00:01:21,173 --> 00:01:22,506
their skill set.

28
00:01:24,278 --> 00:01:25,111
- Gary.

29
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:25,944
- Nice to meet you.

30
00:01:25,944 --> 00:01:26,777
- Nice to meet you man.

31
00:01:26,777 --> 00:01:27,610
Beano, Gary.

32
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:28,443
- Good to meet you.

33
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:29,276
- What up man?

34
00:01:29,276 --> 00:01:30,109
- How you doing man?

35
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:30,942
- How you feeling?

36
00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:31,775
- Real good, man.

37
00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:32,608
Real good.

38
00:01:32,608 --> 00:01:33,441
- Nice to meet you, Sophie.

39
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:34,274
- Sophie?

40
00:01:34,274 --> 00:01:35,107
Gary.

41
00:01:35,107 --> 00:01:35,940
- Gary.

42
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,773
Pleasure.

43
00:01:36,773 --> 00:01:37,606
- How you doing man?

44
00:01:37,606 --> 00:01:38,439
- What's up man?

45
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,272
Gary.

46
00:01:39,272 --> 00:01:40,105
It's a pleasure.

47
00:01:40,105 --> 00:01:40,938
What up man?

48
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:41,771
How are ya?

49
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:42,604
Gary.

50
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:45,739
- Try to stay creative while
we get the marketing ready

51
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,969
and all I don't wanna stop
being in the music vibe,

52
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:50,127
I just wanna keep recording
up until the release

53
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:51,478
date you know?

54
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,644
- Stay in that zone, I love that.

55
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:53,848
- Yeah, just I fell out before.

56
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:56,843
I got out of music and
started getting all like video

57
00:01:56,843 --> 00:01:59,093
and marketing, thinking
about selling the shit.

58
00:01:59,093 --> 00:01:59,926
- Yeah.

59
00:01:59,926 --> 00:02:01,506
- It's like painful getting
back into music mode.

60
00:02:01,506 --> 00:02:05,051
- So while you're in it
you're gonna stay in it.

61
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:06,541
- I'm making myself at home.

62
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:10,127
- Do you think that
opportunity is something that

63
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:13,612
everybody has access to or if it's innate?

64
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:17,341
- I think that, today's world,
there's no more old white

65
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:20,066
guy being the gate keeper so
everybody's got an at bat,

66
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:23,432
I just don't think
everybody's got it like that.

67
00:02:23,432 --> 00:02:26,472
But I think everybody
can maximize their shit.

68
00:02:26,472 --> 00:02:28,178
Listen, I love playing basketball,
I'm not fucking Lebron.

69
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:30,100
You know what I mean?

70
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,392
So we've all got our
talents, but you know,

71
00:02:34,392 --> 00:02:35,750
what you guys do for a living,

72
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,288
I mean I'm looking at music
and I'm spending a lot

73
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:39,227
of time looking at it.

74
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:42,224
Fucking Soundcloud, Spotify,
putting music on vlogs.

75
00:02:42,224 --> 00:02:45,419
No more Jimmy Iovine
fucking trips over you.

76
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:48,874
No more fucking, you're
fucking one song away

77
00:02:48,874 --> 00:02:50,707
like putting out shit,

78
00:02:51,816 --> 00:02:54,937
and you don't even need rap caviar.

79
00:02:54,937 --> 00:02:58,917
You just need to put out
music and I think the one

80
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:00,645
variable, the shit that
I fucking trade on is

81
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:02,414
trade culture.

82
00:03:02,414 --> 00:03:04,928
If you're hungry, and
like trying to think about

83
00:03:04,928 --> 00:03:06,484
your career

84
00:03:06,484 --> 00:03:08,424
it's so hungry right now where you're at.

85
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:10,630
Young, and what's going
through your mind is the same

86
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,209
shit that went through my mind 30 times.

87
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,153
You're saying to yourself in your mind

88
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:16,006
this project, especially with this man,

89
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:18,484
this project, oh, this
is what it's gonna be.

90
00:03:18,484 --> 00:03:19,916
This is what is gonna happen.

91
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:20,749
And guess what?

92
00:03:20,749 --> 00:03:22,336
It might not.

93
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,157
Like for me if I'm in
music I wish I could rap

94
00:03:24,157 --> 00:03:26,745
because I know I could be
humongous because all I would

95
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:30,135
do is make music and then
lay in bed for 11 hours,

96
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:32,009
try to hack on social media.

97
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:34,471
Getting my shit recognized, noticed.

98
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:37,737
You're one person away,
one piece of content away.

99
00:03:37,737 --> 00:03:39,215
You just gotta fucking make it.

100
00:03:39,215 --> 00:03:42,938
What's amazing about music,
I don't like speaking about

101
00:03:42,938 --> 00:03:44,578
shit I don't know so I
don't wanna speak to it but

102
00:03:44,578 --> 00:03:47,657
one thing I do know is I
believe that every artist

103
00:03:47,657 --> 00:03:49,979
that ever lived had a
lot more songs in their

104
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,444
fucking dome than ever saw the day of life

105
00:03:52,444 --> 00:03:54,499
because of the way it worked, right?

106
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:58,281
Now everybody's fancy,
everybody's trying to understand

107
00:03:58,281 --> 00:03:59,460
supply and demand.

108
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,798
I don't think people understand
how busy the world is.

109
00:04:01,798 --> 00:04:04,414
The world's so busy, there's
so much shit that I'm a

110
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:06,602
big fan of telling
people to put out music,

111
00:04:06,602 --> 00:04:08,501
put out music, put out music
like fucking every week.

112
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:10,334
If you've got it like that,
some people don't have it,

113
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,687
I don't know, but if
you've got it like that

114
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:14,167
put it out, put it out.

115
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:15,629
People are hungry for it.

116
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,987
And every time you put out
that's giving you another

117
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:19,137
at bat.

118
00:04:19,137 --> 00:04:21,599
I think that we'll be a big
time artist in the next decade

119
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:23,732
that puts out a song a day.

120
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:25,860
- I agree with that.

121
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,785
We did a campaign last year
called Marathon Monday,

122
00:04:27,785 --> 00:04:29,120
you got the song.

123
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,583
When I saw the reaction to
that, more so than dropping

124
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,416
the album.

125
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,552
- A hundred.

126
00:04:34,552 --> 00:04:35,835
I'm telling you now somebody's
gonna wake up and do

127
00:04:35,835 --> 00:04:38,200
something called 365

128
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,462
and they're gonna start
on fucking January 1st

129
00:04:40,462 --> 00:04:42,587
and they're gonna fucking go.

130
00:04:42,587 --> 00:04:47,041
The reason I love 365 is
you can social commentate.

131
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,329
Like what people love is relevance, right?

132
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:52,951
Do you write or do you just go?

133
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:54,670
- I do both.

134
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,801
- Right so for me, like
just culture right?

135
00:04:57,801 --> 00:05:00,632
Like game seven of the NBA
finals, like you slip a little,

136
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:02,720
like nobody can beat you to the market.

137
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,703
You're just dropping shit
that everybody gives a fuck

138
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:05,536
about.

139
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:07,595
Something pops on fucking
Instagram and everyone's

140
00:05:07,595 --> 00:05:08,428
talking about it?

141
00:05:08,428 --> 00:05:09,561
Just one little line.

142
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:12,030
That's what cooks people,
it's what hooks it, ya know?

143
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,293
It's just, to have that
discipline and to put yourself

144
00:05:16,293 --> 00:05:17,777
out there,

145
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:21,497
to put yourself out there like
yo I'm gonna actually do this

146
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:22,497
that's hard.

147
00:05:24,348 --> 00:05:26,654
It's a risk, but the reward.

148
00:05:26,654 --> 00:05:28,154
I'm all about risk, reward right?

149
00:05:28,154 --> 00:05:29,307
I get a sneaker?

150
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:30,640
Like all upside.

151
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:33,550
The sneaker I got coming
out, like if it fails,

152
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,304
nobody expects a 40 year
old fucking entrepreneur

153
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:38,035
to have a hot kick, right?

154
00:05:38,035 --> 00:05:39,368
But if it works.

155
00:05:40,489 --> 00:05:41,322
Right?

156
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:44,759
I fucking had 2,000 people
at Shoe Palace on Melrose

157
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,502
Tuesday night and the owner walked in.

158
00:05:47,502 --> 00:05:48,494
He's like, "There's more
people here than when we

159
00:05:48,494 --> 00:05:49,752
"dropped Yeezy's."

160
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:50,956
Everybody heard that.

161
00:05:50,956 --> 00:05:52,123
And that's it.

162
00:05:54,196 --> 00:05:55,737
That's what I keep doing, right?

163
00:05:55,737 --> 00:05:57,395
And the best part is you
just have to have humility.

164
00:05:57,395 --> 00:06:00,982
If there was six people
there I'd be like, "I lost."

165
00:06:00,982 --> 00:06:02,683
And that's just when you
get to that place where

166
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:05,132
you just don't give a fuck
about what anybody else thinks.

167
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,447
That's how you put out 365 music, right?

168
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:11,027
Cause that Sunday February
9th you put out something,

169
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:12,519
okay, and people are like, "Whack, whack."

170
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,955
You should have done this project.

171
00:06:13,955 --> 00:06:15,659
That's when you get punched
in the fucking mouth,

172
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:18,741
are you gonna fucking drink
that blood and just record

173
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:21,180
the next day and fucking
get 'em, or you gonna fold

174
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,378
like a cheap chair and be like, "Fuck me."

175
00:06:23,378 --> 00:06:25,893
So you have to have the
right DNA to go for those

176
00:06:25,893 --> 00:06:27,306
kinda projects.

177
00:06:27,306 --> 00:06:29,036
- I don't think there's
anyone in hip hop who could

178
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:30,678
really change things.

179
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:32,401
Like Nipsy can.

180
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:34,187
- And the other thing about it is

181
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:36,867
I've seen you speak a couple times

182
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:39,281
and then I've spoken to a
few people in the tech world

183
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:42,489
to set up these speaking
engagements or these

184
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:45,997
conferences or you know
Gary speaks all the time.

185
00:06:45,997 --> 00:06:48,531
When I saw him speak, it
was like, I've heard a lot

186
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:51,614
of people say the same type of stuff.

187
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:56,010
I've never understood it
until I heard him say it.

188
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,186
And so it's like because of
your firsthand experience

189
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:02,070
and then because of your
point of view and just the way

190
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,050
you are able to communicate
to people and just have

191
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,785
people understand things.

192
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:07,651
And then like the stuff
you're doing with the clothing

193
00:07:07,651 --> 00:07:09,446
and then when you, I watched
the video when you went

194
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:12,369
into Starbucks and you met the guy.

195
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:14,619
And now he's like your CTO.

196
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:18,795
- He had some technology
on the Starbucks table

197
00:07:18,795 --> 00:07:20,544
and I had my daughter, I
was just taking her to the

198
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:23,193
bathroom and it was like
shit I hadn't seen before.

199
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,673
It was like reading the
bone structure of his hand

200
00:07:26,673 --> 00:07:29,701
off of a LCD and he started
explaining that it was

201
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:31,856
autonomous driving.

202
00:07:31,856 --> 00:07:33,140
Designing for Uber.

203
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,392
- Basically for us sitting
down after that meeting.

204
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:36,228
- [Gary] Yeah.

205
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:39,894
- He basically opened my
mind up to how we can, where

206
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:43,954
we intersect as far as tech
and as far as hip hop and

207
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:45,367
culture and just.

208
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:48,738
- Tech is the oxygen of our society.

209
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:50,686
I don't think people understand,
I'm sure you're gonna

210
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:52,047
understand this.

211
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:54,960
Everybody in this room,
everyone's quite young, we're

212
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,059
all gonna live in a mixed reality world.

213
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,386
Contact lenses, when we're
sitting here right now,

214
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:03,087
fucking pock and VR is
sitting right here with us.

215
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:04,754
People have no clue.

216
00:08:06,378 --> 00:08:07,650
They think shit's crazy now?

217
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,207
We haven't even started.

218
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:12,622
This is the fucking national
anthem of a 19 inning game.

219
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:14,088
People haven't even wrapped
their head around how

220
00:08:14,088 --> 00:08:16,107
fucked up shit is gonna be.

221
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:18,297
Are you fucking around
with block chain yet?

222
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,130
- Yeah.

223
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:19,963
- [Gary] You enjoying it?

224
00:08:19,963 --> 00:08:20,796
- Yeah.

225
00:08:20,796 --> 00:08:22,246
- [Gary] You hacking
on top of ethereum yet?

226
00:08:22,246 --> 00:08:23,136
- No not yet.

227
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,697
- [Gary] Not yet, but it's
caught your eye right?

228
00:08:24,697 --> 00:08:25,619
- Yeah.

229
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:27,012
- [Gary] Yeah that shit's
gonna be fucking ...

230
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:29,729
And that's why I'm trying to
push you and your young man

231
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:32,481
here and everybody to debate
this idea if the world

232
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:36,447
is in an issue of supply
and demand then why not

233
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:38,433
have the thesis of just
fucking pounding out-

234
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:40,993
I have a man following me everywhere.

235
00:08:40,994 --> 00:08:41,827
- What do you mean by that?

236
00:08:41,827 --> 00:08:42,826
What's the issue with supply and demand?

237
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:45,332
- There's so much supply of
content that you can never

238
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:47,590
be overexposed cause
everybody's getting pulled in

239
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,082
so many directions.

240
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:51,097
So the reason nobody wanted
to put out so much music

241
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,974
before, overexposure, overexposure.

242
00:08:53,974 --> 00:08:54,961
That shit doesn't exist.

243
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:57,048
There's nobody overexposed
cause everybody's getting

244
00:08:57,048 --> 00:08:58,593
pulled in so many directions.

245
00:08:58,593 --> 00:09:00,755
- So did people just evolve
to take in more info?

246
00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:04,922
- That's for damn sure, but
even at scale, I think that

247
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:08,423
you can't be overexposed
as an artist if you're

248
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,233
capable of putting out a song every day.

249
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:11,068
- Right.

250
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:12,427
- And that's where
everyone's fucked up, right?

251
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,936
You know how it used to be right?

252
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:15,864
You come out, you do your
thing then you fucking

253
00:09:15,864 --> 00:09:19,997
disappear, gotta keep that balance right?

254
00:09:19,997 --> 00:09:22,967
I think that shit's so
competitive, there's so much

255
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:25,305
great content, there's
so much shit going on

256
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:28,562
that if you've got it like that.

257
00:09:28,562 --> 00:09:29,395
- You gotta go.

258
00:09:29,395 --> 00:09:30,228
- You gotta go.

259
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:31,356
- But you know that's
interesting because if you look

260
00:09:31,356 --> 00:09:35,664
at what made Future Pop like
shift gears, what made like

261
00:09:35,664 --> 00:09:37,395
Raw shift gears and like-

262
00:09:37,395 --> 00:09:38,228
What's up?

263
00:09:38,228 --> 00:09:39,061
- Sup man?

264
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:39,894
- [Male Voice] What's up bro?

265
00:09:39,894 --> 00:09:41,490
This is Shep, this Tay.

266
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,666
- Shep, Tay, Gary.

267
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,867
- What's up bro, Shep.

268
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:44,700
- Sup man, it's my pleasure.

269
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,533
- Nice to meet you.

270
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:46,366
- How are ya?

271
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:47,199
Real pleasure.

272
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:49,294
- It was them pounding like
dropping music bro they

273
00:09:49,294 --> 00:09:50,396
fucking went crazy.

274
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:51,229
- Dropping music.

275
00:09:51,229 --> 00:09:52,264
Look how much fucking
music Drake puts out?

276
00:09:52,264 --> 00:09:53,385
- Right, yeah.

277
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,577
- It's a lot of fucking
music by standards of what we

278
00:09:55,577 --> 00:09:57,397
all grew up with.

279
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:58,913
He's putting more music out
in 24 months than people

280
00:09:58,913 --> 00:10:00,577
put out in their careers.

281
00:10:00,577 --> 00:10:03,025
- I think the x factor is
the quality, if you can

282
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:04,195
manufacture the quality.

283
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:06,027
- Well this comes down to talent, right?

284
00:10:06,027 --> 00:10:07,180
Like this is my thing with you,

285
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,308
you gotta push the boundaries
of how talented are you?

286
00:10:11,308 --> 00:10:12,422
- I agree with that.

287
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:14,688
- Right? How talented are you?

288
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:18,427
There's always especially
something as fucking

289
00:10:18,427 --> 00:10:21,267
culturally relevant and
as passionate as art,

290
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:22,589
you guys do art.

291
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:27,216
If you've got it in you
to do it, then you do it.

292
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:28,540
Some people don't, some
people got different processes

293
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,558
right?

294
00:10:29,558 --> 00:10:31,738
You can't force it.

295
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:33,488
But if you've got it.

296
00:10:34,506 --> 00:10:38,599
If your notebook is fulled,
full, full with bangers

297
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:40,637
you need to put that shit out.

298
00:10:40,637 --> 00:10:42,696
It can't be like Prince and
you fucking, when we find

299
00:10:42,696 --> 00:10:44,646
him dead and you go in the
safe and there's a hundred

300
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:45,551
other great songs.

301
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:47,570
That day doesn't exist anymore.

302
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,528
Him and MJ didn't have
it, they couldn't do that.

303
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:53,314
They had to wait every three
years to put out 11 of them.

304
00:10:53,314 --> 00:10:56,024
Anything anybody does,
somebody aspires to do.

305
00:10:56,024 --> 00:10:56,857
- Yeah.

306
00:10:58,084 --> 00:11:01,138
- It just didn't work
like that back in the day.

307
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:02,442
I'm a business man.

308
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:05,559
Do you know what a 41 year
old white business man

309
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,202
looked like in culture 20 years ago?

310
00:11:07,202 --> 00:11:09,003
(laughter)

311
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:11,786
Same with producers right?

312
00:11:11,786 --> 00:11:15,809
Who was talking about
producers 30 years ago?

313
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:18,946
The internet literally
came along and leveled the,

314
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:21,676
like not even leveled the playing field,

315
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:23,313
you know what it did?

316
00:11:23,313 --> 00:11:26,646
It ate up the distribution of everything

317
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:30,544
and then took nothing for it.

318
00:11:30,544 --> 00:11:33,426
And is paying out two groups of people.

319
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,930
The biggest ballers
who built on top of it,

320
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,167
Facebook, Google,

321
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:40,834
it's basically like the
internet is the land

322
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,786
and what Facebook and
Google did is like build the

323
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,953
trains and the planes, but
all the artists, everybody

324
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:51,509
with the IP the leverage,
they're getting the dollars.

325
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:52,342
No more middle.

326
00:11:52,342 --> 00:11:55,719
Middle men have to bring so much value now

327
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:58,905
which is great, you can't
just sit and be like cool.

328
00:11:58,905 --> 00:12:00,067
Right?

329
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:00,900
That's it.

330
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,526
And there's merit to it.

331
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:04,028
People that deserve it are getting it.

332
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:06,562
And it hasn't even started.

333
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:08,000
- You know what I noticed
over here and I want your

334
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,163
opinion on this, I've
noticed that every idea that

335
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:14,486
I've had whether it's
drum kit or the podcast

336
00:12:14,486 --> 00:12:16,153
or whatever it was pass the aux.

337
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,278
- Good.

338
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,658
- They're all things that
I've felt like would be

339
00:12:19,658 --> 00:12:21,075
really fun to do.

340
00:12:21,954 --> 00:12:26,213
And my philosophy that
I'm adopting now is like

341
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:28,418
if it's fun it's probably worth doing.

342
00:12:28,418 --> 00:12:29,817
- You know why that happens?

343
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:32,317
It's a bigger macro situation.

344
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,260
Because it's fun, you're
willing to work your face off.

345
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,264
- Right.

346
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:39,097
- And working your face off
is actually the gateway.

347
00:12:39,097 --> 00:12:40,164
It's not the fun.

348
00:12:40,164 --> 00:12:43,763
The fun is the doorway that
gets you to put in the work that

349
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,986
gets you the results.

350
00:12:45,986 --> 00:12:49,292
Because D-Rock loves filming,
the 24/7 nature of what he

351
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:53,459
does, is why so many kids
wanna film and do this but

352
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:56,366
they don't wanna, it's
not fun enough for them.

353
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:58,014
You have to love it.

354
00:12:58,014 --> 00:13:00,194
The cost of entry now,
see do you understand?

355
00:13:00,194 --> 00:13:04,447
For me, building brands,
whether it's my own brand

356
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:06,360
brands for other people,
other things, the why,

357
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,576
it's so the only thing
I give a shit about that

358
00:13:09,576 --> 00:13:12,517
I'm willing to put in
the 19 that it takes.

359
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:14,429
Because the problem is
now with the internet like

360
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:16,036
we were just saying being
the middle man and everybody

361
00:13:16,036 --> 00:13:18,873
can play, there's some kid
in Kansas City who's gonna

362
00:13:18,873 --> 00:13:19,765
put in the 19.

363
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,010
- Right.

364
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,034
- Might even put in 20.

365
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:26,894
- I don't want any of you
little fuckers to take my shit.

366
00:13:26,894 --> 00:13:29,207
Now what's amazing is though,
the biggest things I didn't

367
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:32,636
know is that's some fun,
but there's so much that all

368
00:13:32,636 --> 00:13:35,118
those little fuckers that
are gonna put in the 19

369
00:13:35,118 --> 00:13:37,996
are gonna get theirs too
and that makes me happy.

370
00:13:37,996 --> 00:13:38,829
- Yeah.

371
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:42,730
- I would say fun's a great
gateway to, fun is the

372
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,801
precursor to ridiculous amount of work

373
00:13:45,801 --> 00:13:47,487
which then gets you there, right?

374
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:48,520
- Yeah.

375
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,356
How often do you balance
that for yourself?

376
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:55,803
How often is it fun and
how often is it not fun?

377
00:13:55,803 --> 00:13:59,091
- As long as it's macro
fun, I recognize micro shit

378
00:13:59,091 --> 00:13:59,924
exists.

379
00:14:01,358 --> 00:14:03,329
Like Tuesday might suck.

380
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:04,746
March might suck.

381
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:06,984
2018 might suck.

382
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,053
But macro it's fun.

383
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:13,308
And when you get to that
perspective, you stop, you don't

384
00:14:13,308 --> 00:14:16,746
slow down when Tuesday,
March or a year is shit.

385
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:18,859
And that's why most people
lose, cause they stop

386
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:23,152
either an hour into it not
going well, a day, a week,

387
00:14:23,152 --> 00:14:24,189
a month.

388
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:25,022
Got it?

389
00:14:25,022 --> 00:14:25,855
- Right.

390
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:28,409
- So nothing's perfect every second.

391
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,586
The best things on earth,
nothing's perfect but having

392
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:34,234
the understanding that
macro, what else would you

393
00:14:34,234 --> 00:14:35,297
rather be doing?

394
00:14:35,297 --> 00:14:36,894
- Exactly, exactly.

395
00:14:36,894 --> 00:14:38,930
- And then you start complaining
about dumb shit, right?

396
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:39,763
- Yeah.

397
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:41,857
- Meanwhile you're playing
the game of your dreams.

398
00:14:41,857 --> 00:14:44,113
Like little you growing up
in Newark, if you would have

399
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:46,505
showed this now, you and Dr. Dre?

400
00:14:46,505 --> 00:14:47,913
Come on.

401
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:48,746
- It's crazy.

402
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:49,626
It's crazy every time I see him.

403
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:50,891
- So that's it, you know what I mean?

404
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,808
So I'm perspective out.

405
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:55,441
- That makes so much sense.

406
00:14:55,441 --> 00:14:57,065
- That's what's so great about media now.

407
00:14:57,065 --> 00:14:59,086
Ten years ago we would have
met and been like oh let's

408
00:14:59,086 --> 00:15:00,633
chop it up in the future,
now I'm like boom, let's put

409
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,794
them on brown bags, we put out content.

410
00:15:02,794 --> 00:15:05,472
Turn yourself into a media company.

411
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:07,765
You can always do stuff,
always do stuff right?

412
00:15:07,765 --> 00:15:09,140
- Yeah, it's 360 nature now.

413
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,189
- Oh god it's so fun.

414
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:13,439
And the stakes are so high.

415
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:15,969
The stakes are so high.

416
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:18,265
The people that don't
grab this shit by the neck

417
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:21,008
over the next two decades are
gonna sit back and be like,

418
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:24,000
"What the fuck was I thinking?
How did I not see it?"

419
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,703
- Yeah, 100%.

420
00:15:25,703 --> 00:15:26,536
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

421
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:27,369
They're ahead of the curve.

422
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:30,248
What he's doing, he might be the only one.

423
00:15:30,248 --> 00:15:31,081
- I am.

424
00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:35,545
- He took something that
used to be held secret and he

425
00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:38,899
opened sourced it and created
an API and so he's scaling

426
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:40,457
like a tech company.

427
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:41,350
- When you put it like that.

428
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,100
- And that's what I'm doing.

429
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,714
The business knowledge and
the ideas I have I'm sharing

430
00:15:46,714 --> 00:15:48,192
them with the world for free.

431
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:49,038
- Yep.

432
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:50,451
- This is stuff people used to sell.

433
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:52,852
This is stuff a bunch of
losers are selling now

434
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:53,986
and are giving you nothing.

435
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,947
This is stuff that I get paid
tens of millions of dollars

436
00:15:55,947 --> 00:15:58,259
for and I'm giving it to these
fuckers for free if they're

437
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:00,028
willing to just sit on their
ass and watch it a little

438
00:16:00,028 --> 00:16:00,994
bit on YouTube.

439
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,603
That is incredible.

440
00:16:02,603 --> 00:16:03,509
That's why I have power.

441
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:04,973
That's why so many people show up.

442
00:16:04,973 --> 00:16:07,220
Cause I'm giving the best shit for free.

443
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,534
- It's funny cause I think
the biggest reason everything

444
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:12,320
ends up working is he does
the podcast, he does the Q&A

445
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,735
thing, he gets on Twitter
he responds to people.

446
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:16,074
- Love, love, love, love,
love, love, love, love, love.

447
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:17,657
- Exactly, exactly.

448
00:16:20,081 --> 00:16:22,692
- He gives a lot away for free too though.

449
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:23,525
- It's leverage.

450
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:24,661
- Yeah.

451
00:16:24,661 --> 00:16:26,467
Listen, everybody close their
eyes and think about the

452
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:28,861
person that brings you the
most happiness and love and

453
00:16:28,861 --> 00:16:32,131
value, you're always trying
to be around that person.

454
00:16:32,131 --> 00:16:33,131
- 100%.

455
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:35,446
It's actually gonna be here tonight.

456
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:36,279
- [Gary] Thank you.

457
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,909
- Wait are you Gary Vee?

458
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:39,742
- [Gary] I am.

459
00:16:39,742 --> 00:16:40,965
- I'm such a big fan of yours.

460
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:41,798
I'm Jacqueline.

461
00:16:41,798 --> 00:16:42,899
- Hi.

462
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,420
- I used to manage a group
that you used in a song

463
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,254
in one of your YouTube videos, Saunder.

464
00:16:48,254 --> 00:16:49,087
- Who's that?

465
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:49,920
- Saunder?

466
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,172
- [D-Rock] Oh yeah, I love Saunder.

467
00:16:51,172 --> 00:16:52,189
- Oh yeah, okay D Rock.

468
00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:53,057
How are you?

469
00:16:53,057 --> 00:16:53,890
I'm great.

470
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,723
- What's your name?

471
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:55,556
- I'm Jaqueline.

472
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,389
- Jacqueline, nice to meet you.

473
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:57,222
- Very nice to meet you.

474
00:16:57,222 --> 00:16:58,055
- Such a pleasure.

475
00:16:58,055 --> 00:16:58,888
- Thank you for doing
all the work that you do.

476
00:16:58,888 --> 00:16:59,721
- Of course, thank you for the love.

477
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:00,554
- You're killing it.

478
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:01,387
- Thank you.

479
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,220
- What are you guys up to?

480
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,053
- About to go into this place,
this is Incubator right?

481
00:17:03,053 --> 00:17:03,886
- This is the best place.

482
00:17:03,886 --> 00:17:04,719
- It is alright if I get
a photo with you, man?

483
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:05,551
- Of course, man what's your name?

484
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:06,384
- I'm Ty.

485
00:17:06,385 --> 00:17:07,218
- Ty let's do it.

486
00:17:07,218 --> 00:17:08,050
- I talk about you all
the time to my boss, man.

487
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:08,883
- Thank you, man.

488
00:17:08,884 --> 00:17:09,857
- You're literally like
inspiration for a lot of people.

489
00:17:09,857 --> 00:17:10,690
- Nice to meet you.

490
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,260
- It's such a pleasure, thank
you for the love, take care.

491
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,927
- Dude this is sick.

492
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:18,478
Seriously keep going, you
inspire me so fucking much, bro,

493
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:19,502
seriously.

494
00:17:19,502 --> 00:17:20,984
- I will, thank you man thank
you so much for the love,

495
00:17:20,984 --> 00:17:21,977
thank you, take care of yourself.

496
00:17:21,978 --> 00:17:22,810
You're not coming up?

497
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:23,643
- Oh I didn't know if it was.

498
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:24,477
- They can come up right?

499
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:25,839
Yeah, let's go.

500
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,362
- They gotta go see Tyrese.

501
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:30,040
- Oh go see Tyrese, I'm
not trying to hold you up.

502
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,467
We can chop it up, we're all
east coast, we can chop it

503
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:33,523
out anytime.

504
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:34,945
- Yeah, I appreciate it.

505
00:17:34,945 --> 00:17:37,739
- My man, I'll see you in
September, we're gonna lock you

506
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:38,987
in for brown bags.

507
00:17:38,987 --> 00:17:39,820
- Let's do it.

508
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,858
- I think we got the date already.

509
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:42,167
Hopefully you're around and if
not, we'll do it in October.

510
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:43,530
- You wanna do a pic?

511
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,530
- Oh yeah, let's definitely do that.

512
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:49,850
- Good day, huh?

513
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:50,683
- I smell like weed.

514
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:51,516
- You do?

515
00:17:51,516 --> 00:17:52,349
- I do.

516
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:53,182
- What's up man, good to see ya.

517
00:17:53,182 --> 00:17:54,927
- Josh, good to see you too.

518
00:17:54,927 --> 00:17:56,209
- I was in the studio, Nipsy
has to, smell me, smell me.

519
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:57,459
- Yeah, you do.

520
00:17:58,945 --> 00:17:59,945
- Great day.

521
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:02,349
- Jessie, nice to meet you.

522
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:03,569
- Cruising today.

523
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:04,640
- You been having a good week?

524
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,473
- Yeah.

525
00:18:05,473 --> 00:18:06,306
- Good, man.

526
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:07,514
Yeah, everyone's been
like it's been good right?

527
00:18:07,514 --> 00:18:09,227
You guys been entouraging it up?

528
00:18:09,227 --> 00:18:12,218
- Broken tables and
chairs, when we got here.

529
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:16,848
We cleared it out, this guy's
in museums all over the world.

530
00:18:16,848 --> 00:18:18,409
- What the fuck?

531
00:18:18,409 --> 00:18:20,583
- This is a priceless
fucking installation here.

532
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:23,142
And it's all blacklight.

533
00:18:23,142 --> 00:18:24,147
- Seriously?

534
00:18:24,147 --> 00:18:25,199
Like this.

535
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:26,327
- He's in like a high point
in his career right now,

536
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:28,406
it's unbelievable.

537
00:18:28,406 --> 00:18:29,871
- So if I came when you guys
were sleeping and cut this

538
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:31,479
out and sold this slate, how much?

539
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:33,036
- Oh ...

540
00:18:33,036 --> 00:18:36,035
- What do you think, what do you think?

541
00:18:36,035 --> 00:18:38,239
- I think his last one was
like half a million to 3/4.

542
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:39,937
- No this is tens of
thousands maybe for that.

543
00:18:39,937 --> 00:18:43,100
- So when you're sleeping
tomorrow when I send Bab in here

544
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,099
and drill this out I
can get like 30 for it?

545
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:46,942
- Yeah, but this piece, so in New York ...

546
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:48,826
- But this whole thing.

547
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:51,595
Oh yeah, in New York this is
this the hottest night club.

548
00:18:51,595 --> 00:18:54,113
- Exactly, we were like we
can build these little nests

549
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:54,946
back here.

550
00:18:54,946 --> 00:18:55,779
- And so what?

551
00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:56,612
You guys.

552
00:18:56,612 --> 00:18:57,445
- This was just a broken table and chairs.

553
00:18:57,445 --> 00:18:58,476
- And so you're boys with this guy?

554
00:18:58,476 --> 00:18:59,309
- Yeah.

555
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:00,142
- Clearly.

556
00:19:00,142 --> 00:19:01,667
- So we represent him and
help do some deals for him.

557
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:02,500
- Got it.

558
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,142
- And then he was like if
do a big mural for you we

559
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:06,654
can bring people through,
it's easier, it's all

560
00:19:06,654 --> 00:19:08,952
blacklight, as well so
at night it goes up.

561
00:19:08,952 --> 00:19:12,732
But this is if you Google
Kenny Scharf, it's just float

562
00:19:12,732 --> 00:19:13,793
Vaskiot, Herring, Warhol.

563
00:19:13,793 --> 00:19:15,382
That's the crew and him.

564
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:16,702
He's the only one that's alive.

565
00:19:16,702 --> 00:19:18,619
That's the only reason.

566
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:20,535
- Right when he dies, okay.

567
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:21,368
Babbit.

568
00:19:23,633 --> 00:19:25,115
How old is he?

569
00:19:25,115 --> 00:19:26,282
- Mid sixties.

570
00:19:28,402 --> 00:19:29,591
He was in here at night.

571
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:30,946
- When you kill him.

572
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:35,287
- And this is like this
weed bottle stuff, he just

573
00:19:35,287 --> 00:19:37,072
comes in a glues this shit all the time.

574
00:19:37,072 --> 00:19:37,905
It's been going.

575
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:39,238
- And he lives out here?

576
00:19:39,238 --> 00:19:43,204
- Yeah we can see our flag from his house.

577
00:19:43,204 --> 00:19:44,479
And we do different parties up here.

578
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:47,056
I have a small wine sponsor
going, I even have like

579
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:48,465
different wine glasses going.

580
00:19:48,465 --> 00:19:52,632
- Hey, hey, Tyler, connect
Kip Garcia, Phil I know you're

581
00:19:53,781 --> 00:19:54,938
so close to this.

582
00:19:54,938 --> 00:19:57,933
Let's do something proper
here to get more exposure.

583
00:19:57,933 --> 00:20:00,111
- Okay so flag was broken
for 10 years, I had it fixed

584
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:02,209
and the one day after it clips
we can put anything we want

585
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:03,143
in it.

586
00:20:03,143 --> 00:20:03,976
- At any time?

587
00:20:03,976 --> 00:20:04,809
- At any time.

588
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:06,298
- So like a Gary Vee flag?

589
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:07,661
- I was gonna make one, but
I thought it'd be too much.

590
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:09,438
- Yeah, nothing's too much by the way.

591
00:20:09,438 --> 00:20:10,376
- Okay perfect, next time.

592
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,626
- Unreal views.

593
00:20:18,114 --> 00:20:18,947
My boy.

594
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:23,498
Do you remember the Laff Olympics?

595
00:20:23,498 --> 00:20:24,331
- No.

596
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:26,229
- Can somebody Google Laff Olympics?

597
00:20:26,229 --> 00:20:27,701
I know I'm saying it right

598
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:29,478
No the Laff Olympics.

599
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,066
It was like the yogi yahoo-ies
vs. the Scooby doobies

600
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:36,796
vs. the rotten scoundrels
and it was like the Olympics

601
00:20:36,796 --> 00:20:38,740
of all the cartoon characters.

602
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,110
I used to watch it on USA.

603
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,092
It exists right?

604
00:20:42,092 --> 00:20:42,925
- Laff.

605
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:44,008
- Laff, yeah.

606
00:20:45,042 --> 00:20:46,846
What does it say?

607
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:47,921
I knew I was right.

608
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:48,985
When did it air?

609
00:20:48,985 --> 00:20:50,740
- Animated comedy television series.

610
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,573
- When?

611
00:20:52,804 --> 00:20:55,371
- Is a spoof of the Olympics in 1977.

612
00:20:55,371 --> 00:20:58,511
Spoof of the Olympics and
the ABC television series

613
00:20:58,511 --> 00:20:59,803
Battle of the Network Stars.

614
00:20:59,803 --> 00:21:01,468
- Yep.

615
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,087
- And it featured 45 Hanna
Barbara characters who

616
00:21:04,087 --> 00:21:07,460
organized the teams, the
Scooby-Doobies, the Yogi-Yahoo-ies

617
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,121
and the Really Rottens.

618
00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:12,103
- Fucking nailed that, gimme some.

619
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:14,585
It was the best cartoon.

620
00:21:14,585 --> 00:21:17,386
Have you guys seen this
new trend all these 18

621
00:21:17,386 --> 00:21:18,397
year olds can't believe
you can watch an antenna

622
00:21:18,397 --> 00:21:19,260
to watch tv?

623
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,026
- I saw the headline.

624
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:22,395
- What is an antenna?

625
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:25,360
- Yeah, like you can get free tv.

626
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,564
They're like oh!

627
00:21:26,564 --> 00:21:28,627
Like if you search it on
twitter they're like "Yo!

628
00:21:28,627 --> 00:21:30,946
"You can get free tv!"

629
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:31,780
and people are like, "How?"

630
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,697
it's called an antenna!

631
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:38,354
It's so fun the way the world works.

632
00:21:38,354 --> 00:21:41,055
The world is actually divided
right now in a way that

633
00:21:41,055 --> 00:21:42,439
we've never seen.

634
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:44,754
There's like two worlds playing out.

635
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:47,295
There's like the mobile
culture and everything that's

636
00:21:47,295 --> 00:21:50,391
real there and then the other one.

637
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:52,558
The one that's in trouble.

638
00:21:54,574 --> 00:21:55,646
- [Male Voice] Tell us
about your company and what

639
00:21:55,646 --> 00:21:58,311
you do for your clients.

640
00:21:58,311 --> 00:21:59,991
- Hey guys it's Gary
Vaynerchuk, CO of Vayner Media.

641
00:21:59,991 --> 00:22:02,908
- [Male Voice] Alexa, ask Gary Vee.

642
00:22:04,715 --> 00:22:06,832
- [Alexa] Hey Gary V, you
should partner up with Green

643
00:22:06,832 --> 00:22:08,915
Street, they're the best.

644
00:22:14,803 --> 00:22:16,720
- How do we get around?

645
00:22:19,688 --> 00:22:20,521
- Sup man?

646
00:22:20,521 --> 00:22:21,354
Gary.

647
00:22:21,354 --> 00:22:22,187
- Gary?

648
00:22:22,187 --> 00:22:23,441
I seen you I think like in podcasts.

649
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:26,154
- Yep, what's your name?

650
00:22:26,154 --> 00:22:26,987
- My name's Brian.

651
00:22:26,987 --> 00:22:27,820
- Nice to meet you man.

652
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,745
Take care of yourself,
thanks for the love man.

653
00:22:30,745 --> 00:22:32,964
I never get involved in content right?

654
00:22:32,964 --> 00:22:33,797
- Yeah.

655
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:35,141
- I was laughing, like I
wonder what Bab would think.

656
00:22:35,141 --> 00:22:37,643
Or like Jake, that was Jake.

657
00:22:37,643 --> 00:22:39,241
And then I got involved in yours too.

658
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:41,241
I wanna destroy Atlanta.

659
00:22:45,718 --> 00:22:47,154
I love you Andy, you
don't get enough love.

660
00:22:47,154 --> 00:22:49,715
Make sure this is in the clip.

661
00:22:49,715 --> 00:22:52,383
What's up with my stuff?

662
00:22:52,383 --> 00:22:53,413
What did they do?

663
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,830
Really? So I gangstered them?

664
00:22:57,323 --> 00:22:58,182
- [Male Voice] Yeah.

665
00:22:58,182 --> 00:22:59,918
- And they accepted the L?

666
00:22:59,918 --> 00:23:03,169
♫ I know that you're waiting
for the new stuff, it'll come.

667
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:05,592
♫ I think that they hate
that I don't care for what

668
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,099
♫ They've done.

669
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:10,905
♫ I moved out the city now
they sound like all my sons.

670
00:23:10,905 --> 00:23:14,713
♫ They say they don't love me
but I know they sing along.

671
00:23:14,713 --> 00:23:18,067
♫ I know that you're waiting
for the new songs, it'll come.

672
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:18,900
- Gary everybody.

673
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,476
- Hello, hello, hello.

674
00:23:20,476 --> 00:23:24,643
♫ I moved out the city now
they sound like all my sons.

675
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:29,651
♫ They say they don't love
me but I know they sing along

676
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:30,754
♫ I did it I did it right.

677
00:23:30,754 --> 00:23:33,358
♫ They looking out for the new.

678
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:34,761
- What do you like that it's good right?

679
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:36,027
How bout that?

680
00:23:36,027 --> 00:23:38,956
I wanna get set up here
in open house in L.A.

681
00:23:38,956 --> 00:23:43,057
Doing some shit with Ferg,

682
00:23:43,057 --> 00:23:43,890
in L.A.

683
00:23:47,765 --> 00:23:50,033
- Diamonds in my mouth
you see me talking lavish.

684
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:51,283
Work work work.

685
00:23:53,075 --> 00:23:54,761
What's the five for?

686
00:23:54,761 --> 00:23:55,919
- It's my favorite number.

687
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,610
It's my lucky ass number.

688
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,443
I'm glad it's not six.

689
00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:04,572
Babin's ready for anything good
and smart cause he's Babin.

690
00:24:04,572 --> 00:24:05,405
- Yeah.

691
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,341
- What you guys don't know
YouTube is that this man

692
00:24:09,341 --> 00:24:12,508
is the man behind your beloved D Rock.

693
00:24:13,381 --> 00:24:14,581
Deloved.

694
00:24:14,581 --> 00:24:15,414
- [D Rock] Not behind.

695
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:16,247
- I know, I'm kidding.

696
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,258
No, no, not behind as
in behind you, meaning

697
00:24:18,258 --> 00:24:20,238
- [D Rock] I'm dying.

698
00:24:20,238 --> 00:24:21,669
- Yeah, you're pride,

699
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:24,002
- You're basically finished.

700
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:28,632
- To finish off your question,
my biggest thing that I want

701
00:24:28,632 --> 00:24:32,220
people to leave with is how
ridiculously impossible it is

702
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,980
to be a human being and how
grateful everybody should be

703
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,750
and to realize that your
grandparents did not have it this

704
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,583
good.

705
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:42,389
This internet thing that
is just second nature to us

706
00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:44,754
it's fundamentally the
biggest thing that has ever

707
00:24:44,754 --> 00:24:48,348
happened to the human
being and if you can't

708
00:24:48,348 --> 00:24:50,498
eliminate your excuses and
do something about your

709
00:24:50,498 --> 00:24:54,116
one life, you're gonna regret
it and regret scares the

710
00:24:54,116 --> 00:24:57,544
shit outta me, so if you
leave with anything please

711
00:24:57,544 --> 00:24:59,915
squeeze the fuck out of
your life cause you get only

712
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,228
one at that.

713
00:25:01,228 --> 00:25:03,478
(applause)

714
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:07,004
- Guys give it up for Gary Vee.

715
00:25:08,116 --> 00:00:00,000
(Hip hop music)
