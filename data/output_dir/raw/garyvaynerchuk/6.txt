- What's up, Vayner?

10
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:29,170
- [Group] What's up?

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,003
- How's the trip going?

12
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:32,830
- [Woman] Oh, so good.

13
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:33,663
- That's awesome.

14
00:00:33,663 --> 00:00:35,820
- [Man] Yeah, so where are you?

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,160
- I'm in Los Angeles.

16
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,410
Hustling, taking care of a couple fires.

17
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,980
I'm so sorry I can't be with everybody.

18
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,150
Why are you guys there?

19
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,910
Because one of you may taste a
candy you've never had before

20
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,685
and become infatuated with
it, bring me back one,

21
00:00:48,685 --> 00:00:52,250
I taste it and seven years
later we buy the company.

22
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,810
Right? Like, shit like that.

23
00:00:55,984 --> 00:00:58,350
And obviously, number three,

24
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,620
one of the things I want to continue

25
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,580
to build on is EQ and team building.

26
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,099
Like, you can't imagine
what's running through

27
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,760
my head right now on
this short little trip

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,560
on how you guys are gonna build some--

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,830
I mean, a lot of you guys
don't know each other.

30
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,820
And you're gonna go from
not knowing each other

31
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,890
or even saying hello in the hall,

32
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,340
to having inside jokes,
to having a friendship

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,810
and maybe even a really great friendship.

34
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,090
And I do think that's something

35
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,180
that I aspire to for our organization.

36
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,080
It's just a fun trip, I mean
there's a fun trip aspect.

37
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,640
I also think your thinking
is extremely valuable

38
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,500
and you're gonna be able
to give some of that

39
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,810
to the people you cross paths with

40
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,520
over the next 72 hours as well.

41
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,920
So just a lot of good that
adds up to an exciting trip.

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,600
I'm obviously disappointed that

43
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,304
I had to deal with a fire
that didn't allow me to come.

44
00:01:45,304 --> 00:01:48,304
(bright pop music)

45
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:15,653
- [Andy] Ready?

46
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:16,513
- [Camera Person] Yeah.

47
00:02:16,513 --> 00:02:18,930
- My name is Andy Krainak,
I'm Brand Director

48
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,440
for Gary Vee at Vayner Media.

49
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,650
- Hi, my name is Lexi
Finger, I am a Media Manager

50
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,860
on the Paid Media team at Vayner Media.

51
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,310
- Hey, I'm Lisa Abinakad,

52
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,040
I'm a Senior Media Planner on Chase.

53
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,350
- Hi, I'm Vinny.

54
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,210
I'm an ACD, Associate Creative Director

55
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,230
at Vayner Media on the Entertainment Team.

56
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,320
- Hi, my name is Jodi Schwartz,

57
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,340
I am Director of Experience
Strategy & Design

58
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,470
at Vayner Media.

59
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,820
- My name is Marta and
I'm a Senior Art Director

60
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,440
in the LA office.

61
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,210
- My name is Christina Blankenship,

62
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,850
I am a Media Supervisor on the Paid Team.

63
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,714
- I'm Polina, I'm an Art Director.

64
00:02:50,714 --> 00:02:54,920
- My name is James Davey,
I am an Account Executive

65
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,100
working out of Vayner Media London.

66
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,240
- I think I got nominated
to go on this trip

67
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,870
because I got the best
squad and they just wanted

68
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,980
to give me love and send me to Helsinki.

69
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,920
- I think I got nominated for this trip

70
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,670
because I love winter and the snow.

71
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,650
And I made that very clear
to all my co-workers.

72
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,890
- My director actually wasn't
able to come to this trip,

73
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,536
so I subbed in and was asked to come

74
00:03:14,536 --> 00:03:16,710
three days before we flew.

75
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,300
- I think I'm known a little bit to be

76
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,900
a bit of a straight shooter and kinda get

77
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,306
to the root of why things
are the way they are.

78
00:03:24,306 --> 00:03:26,850
- I'm happy to be here in Helsinki

79
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,920
because I was able to be a representative

80
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,430
of Vayner Media for
some potential clients.

81
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,720
- I think I got nominated

82
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,940
because I have wonderful
co-workers that love me.

83
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,940
- I kind of abuse the vacation
policy of unlimited vacation.

84
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,378
In turn, I am just always online

85
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:47,040
whenever I actually do go on vacation.

86
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,150
So I think my team just wanted
me to unplug for a while.

87
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,890
- I think I got nominated
to come to Helsinki

88
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,690
because I can speak to a lot
of aspects of production.

89
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,959
- Maybe I'm just good at
cracking on, getting the job done

90
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,959
and trying to exhibit
the key Vayner values

91
00:04:03,092 --> 00:04:07,080
that pretty much I see being
exhibited every day around me.

92
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,413
(pop music)

93
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,991
- Makia was started early 2001

94
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:21,690
but we actually took some careful thinking

95
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,270
and some banging head on the wall

96
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:29,060
and then finally 2007 it
kind of saw the day of light.

97
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,760
Beginning, it was kinda really small,

98
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,760
we had like a tiny cellar,
like all of the patterns

99
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,930
were hand drawn on paper
and made all the samples.

100
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,258
Everything was like hand made.

101
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:42,591
(pop music)

102
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:50,178
(light music)

103
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,670
- It's 12 p.m., Helsinki, Wednesday.

104
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,780
The whole group has finally arrived.

105
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,320
Right now we're going to
some top culinary chef

106
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,960
to prepare some meals and
have a culinary lesson.

107
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,743
(light pop music)

108
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:41,708
- It's cold.

109
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,050
Had a great meal cooked by us

110
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,660
and a head culinary chef from Finland.

111
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,346
Now we're going to ArcticStartup.

112
00:05:51,346 --> 00:05:53,846
(light music)

113
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,810
- So, welcome to old Maria Hospital.

114
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,130
This used to be a hospital
for more than 100 years.

115
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,170
Two years ago, the city of Helsinki

116
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,410
decided to convert into a startup hall.

117
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,065
And today it's home to about 80 startups,

118
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:12,547
15 investment companies and
then a couple service providers.

119
00:06:12,547 --> 00:06:16,450
Totaling more than 600 people
already operating here.

120
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,550
Today, we're going to hear some pitches

121
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,070
from our core business
related media events

122
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,300
and then we're gonna hear some of these

123
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,278
other portfolio companies
tell us what they're doing.

124
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:28,861
(upbeat music)

125
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,910
- Helsinki, we're in the lobby.

126
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,400
We're just jamming on the decks,

127
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,710
mini 4Ds presentation
we're gonna be doing.

128
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,300
We're breaking up into two groups

129
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,120
and going through two different companies,

130
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,910
trying to deliver the things
that they asked of us.

131
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,160
And then also giving them context
on what Vayner Media does.

132
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,590
It's exciting, it's fun
to jam with these people

133
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,320
and learn more about what
they do day-to-day at Vayner.

134
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,970
I'm really impressed with
just their skills and talents,

135
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,220
and the different expertise we have here.

136
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,053
So it's fun.

137
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:00,683
(light music)

138
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,680
- [Camera Person] Vinny,
where are we going?

139
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,290
- Somewhere in Helsinki, through the snow.

140
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,677
Over the river and through the woods

141
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:14,670
to Jan's friend's place we go.

142
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,260
You don't know what I'm
talking about, do you?

143
00:07:18,757 --> 00:07:21,140
We're gonna go present the 4Ds

144
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,460
and what Vayner does to a
bunch of these companies

145
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,930
that Jan has put together
so we can give them

146
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,100
a little idea of what we do, how we do it,

147
00:07:30,436 --> 00:07:33,420
and give them a little peek
under the hood of Vayner Media.

148
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,350
So I think it should be great,

149
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,130
we put some great presentations together.

150
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,396
Hopefully they get a
little something out of it.

151
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:41,229
(heavy pop music)

152
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:48,175
- Beautiful snow here in Helsinki.

153
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:51,375
Just took a trip, arrived at...

154
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,183
Fazer? That's how you say it?

155
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:55,170
- Fazer, yeah.

156
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,672
Candy, chocolate.

157
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:59,505
(light pop music)

158
00:08:14,414 --> 00:08:16,090
- So we wrapped up with Fazer.

159
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,500
We had some candy,
chocolate, a good lunch.

160
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,477
Now we're heading back
to the Civic Center,

161
00:08:21,477 --> 00:08:23,978
going to the Shortcut community.

162
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:27,700
They help refugees and
immigrants to integrate

163
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,596
into the Finnish ecosystem
with your business.

164
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:33,179
(techno music)

165
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,440
- We are at Langvik I've never
actually been here before,

166
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,437
but it's like this very
nice conference center.

167
00:09:06,437 --> 00:09:08,097
♪ I've been lane changing too long ♪

168
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:09,834
♪ I've been way too in my zone ♪

169
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:11,729
♪ I'm just so caught up in money baby ♪

170
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:13,720
♪ I ain't even chasing them hoes ♪

171
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,580
- But what I want you to do
now, you see these cards.

172
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,680
Beautiful different cards,
it's from a game called Dixit.

173
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,000
So what we have planned right now,

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,040
is that you pick two cards.

175
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,910
One that represents you
and your inner-self,

176
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,880
and two that represents
what you are willing to give

177
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,170
to the group today.

178
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,630
Whether that's skills,
whether that's who you are,

179
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,590
whatever, anything.

180
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,040
What do you want to give to the group?

181
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,873
(inspiring music)

182
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,610
- I love being vulnerable and
not knowing what's going on,

183
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,280
but also just like winging it.

184
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,900
- You know, looking for
good incentives today.

185
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,098
Looking for that, you
know, blue sky thinking.

186
00:09:52,098 --> 00:09:54,530
- I think I'm kind of shy
and quiet at the start,

187
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,790
but some of you have learned that

188
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,350
I'm really kind of just crazy.

189
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,630
- A synonym for design is manipulation.

190
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,350
The artist manipulated the art

191
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,983
so they're a designer, and that's also me.

192
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:09,650
(light inspirational music)

193
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,960
- [Andy] My favorite part
of this trip to Helsinki

194
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,056
has been connecting with
the eight other people

195
00:10:19,056 --> 00:10:20,400
that I was flown here with.

196
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,090
- Making 10 new best friends.

197
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,020
- All the friends that I've made here

198
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,690
even though we've been
in the same building.

199
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,060
- How hard we've been going.

200
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,240
It's been outrageous how much we've been

201
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,800
working and playing and
we've worked with so many

202
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,229
different companies and startups.

203
00:10:35,229 --> 00:10:38,139
Jan has really, and everyone
at ArcticStartup has really

204
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:42,880
redefined my mindset and
my definition of hustling.

205
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,892
- When we get into a room
and start working together

206
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:47,210
and putting together
some thought-starters,

207
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,620
there's that one common
thread that comes through.

208
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,120
Like, we're across
departments, but we all have

209
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,440
that same approach to work, same tactics.

210
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,440
- The sauna, I think
it's a great experience.

211
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,400
I liked the combination of cold and warm.

212
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,700
- Walking barefoot in the ice and snow,

213
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,630
because it gave me perspective
about what real cold is.

214
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,270
I will never complain again.

215
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,550
- The hospitality of all the people here

216
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,460
that we've met in Finland.

217
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,712
All the people who've
helped organize this.

218
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:20,654
Any kind of interaction we've had

219
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:23,194
with the people here has been phenomenal.

220
00:11:23,194 --> 00:11:24,027
- When we were putting together

221
00:11:24,027 --> 00:11:26,900
what we were gonna talk about
through these presentations,

222
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,900
I noticed that myself and
the other people on the team,

223
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,590
even though we worked
in different departments

224
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,350
and different disciplines, we still had

225
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,230
a lot of the same core tenets

226
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,630
that we were gonna be speaking to.

227
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,920
And then personally, I would say,

228
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,080
I mean I'm sure everybody gives

229
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,840
the same answer, but the people.

230
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,890
We had a lot of great, just moments,

231
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,090
and I got to know a lot of
really cool people on the team

232
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,895
that I haven't worked with closely before.

233
00:11:47,895 --> 00:11:49,530
Or the couple of people I did know,

234
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,760
I got to know them better.

235
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,210
So between the dance parties that we had

236
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,103
and the time joking around on the bus

237
00:11:55,103 --> 00:11:57,340
or the different vans we took,

238
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,660
and even ice skating that
we did this afternoon.

239
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,940
I got to know a bunch of
people in a different way

240
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,477
than you do in the office and I think

241
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:09,110
that core togetherness is
what makes us so strong.

242
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,870
So thanks Claude, thanks Gary,

243
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,110
thanks to whoever nominated me for this.

244
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,180
Very much appreciated and hopefully

245
00:12:15,180 --> 00:00:00,000
I can return that favor sometime.
