1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:02,625
- On this episode,
Erik Wahl stops by and

2
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:05,250
we get artistic and thoughtful.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,333
(hip hop music)

4
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:19,750
- [Gary] You ask questions,

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,667
and I answer them

6
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:27,625
this is The #AskGaryVee Show.

7
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,500
- Hey everybody,
it's Gary Vay-ner-chuk

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,875
and this is episode 243

9
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:38,166
of The #AskGaryVee Show

10
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,291
and I'm super excited.

11
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,625
Another guest, Erik.

12
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,625
- Dude, you do that so good.

13
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,792
- Actually, I've
been rusty lately,

14
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:45,250
but since I did it
recently, I remembered

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,583
what the title was.

16
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:47,625
You've got a
big Sharpie with you.

17
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,708
Erik Wahl, welcome to the show.

18
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,208
Thrilled to see you, my man.

19
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,375
- Thank you kindly.

20
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,500
Appreciate the
opportunity to be here.

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,750
- I'm excited because
you've got a big book launch.

22
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,708
We've got a call-in show.

23
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,583
You are a killer of the arts.

24
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:01,959
I mean, people
who are seeing this,

25
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:04,041
you might have seen the
version you've made for myself.

26
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,166
In episodes of DailyVee.

27
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,417
You are a very talented dude

28
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:12,417
that I've gotten to
know in the last year or so,

29
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:14,583
and I'm excited to
introduce you to the audience.

30
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,458
So for the people that
don't know who you are,

31
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:17,959
how do you sum yourself up?

32
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:21,041
- I am a disruptive strategist.

33
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:25,000
So, I'm a performance
artist who speaks

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,375
on the
corporate lecture circuit.

35
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,208
I'm also an author.

36
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:30,500
Flying around,
doing 100 shows a year

37
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,291
for the last 12 years in a row.

38
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:36,708
Sharing about
disruption, how to innovate,

39
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:40,792
how to differentiate
from the competition,

40
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:42,375
how to embrace the
future of business.

41
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:46,542
But it's a very niche
market, so it's all corporate.

42
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:50,667
Conferences, sales events, but
I don't do many public shows,

43
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:53,333
so I'm not a household name.

44
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,250
I'm invisible to pop culture.

45
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,834
- Because you've been
more into a B2B strategy.

46
00:01:57,834 --> 00:01:58,834
- Exactly.
- Right.

47
00:01:58,834 --> 00:01:59,667
- Speaking to corporate.

48
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:00,959
- So how did you get there?

49
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,792
Did you come, I'm going to
assume, just knowing your vibe,

50
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:05,625
you came up as
an artist and then,

51
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,959
did you stumble into that world?

52
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,041
Or did you go the other way?

53
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,083
Help me.
- Negative.

54
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,041
I'm a former,--
- See?

55
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:10,792
- I'm a former suit.

56
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:12,667
- That's why you
don't assume, people.

57
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:13,625
Sorry, Stephan.

58
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,125
- I have a very
logical, linear background.

59
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:19,834
I went to school, went
to, got a job out of school

60
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:21,708
as a partner in a firm.

61
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,917
- Jesus.

62
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:24,834
- Did that for eight years,

63
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:26,375
then had an early
mid-life crisis, and,

64
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,000
- So at 30?
- At 30.

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,959
- I did too, a little bit.
- Yeah?

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,917
And that's where
I found the arts.

67
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:35,917
I didn't care about
creativity in the arts

68
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:36,750
because there
was no money in it.

69
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,583
- Yeah.

70
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,417
- You can't make it.
There's no ROI.

71
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:40,083
- So what kind of kid were you?

72
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,834
So you drawn, you were,--
- I was an athlete.

73
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:42,875
- You were an athlete?

74
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,500
- Athlete and I
was an alpha dog,

75
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,458
so divide and conquer, kick ass.

76
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,875
If it was in school,--
- What did you play?

77
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:48,625
- I was a wrestler.

78
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:49,792
I also, you know,
football, baseball, basketball.

79
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:50,583
- Where did you grow up?

80
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:51,375
- In Seattle, Washington.

81
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,917
- Okay, are you a Seahawks fan?

82
00:02:53,917 --> 00:02:54,750
No?

83
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,083
- I'm a recovering Seahawks,

84
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,208
so I, because I
watched it with my dad,--

85
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,000
- Yeah.

86
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,708
- I was a Seahawks fan,
I was Mariner fan.

87
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,250
- You loved Steve Largent?

88
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,083
(both laugh)

89
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:02,917
- You know who Steve Largent is?

90
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:03,750
- Listen, we're old.

91
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,834
- Yeah.
- I do.

92
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:06,125
- Jim Zorn.
- I'm 41 years old.

93
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,500
- Jim Zorn
through to Steve Largent.

94
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,625
Sherman Smith is
who carried the pill.

95
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,208
Dan Doornik,--
- Oh, you?

96
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,458
In Seattle, people that I know.

97
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,583
- You're bringin' it.

98
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,458
- And I also was there,

99
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,083
- But I remember
Warner and David Kreig.

100
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:19,041
I'm like, I remember those
mid-'80s Seahawks teams.

101
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,291
- And I remember Al Toon.

102
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,792
- Yep, that's my boy.

103
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:22,750
- I remember, I don't
remember Joe Namath.

104
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,333
- Yeah, me neither.

105
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,417
- That, my dad told me.
- So,

106
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:25,166
- My dad told me about it.

107
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,667
- So Seattle athlete.
- Yep.

108
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:28,333
- Alpha dog, win, win, win.
- Yep.

109
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,542
- Go into job, get a
good job, duh, duh, duh.

110
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:31,458
- Win, win, win, there.

111
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,917
- 30 years old, freak out.

112
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:36,583
- Dot-com bomb, I got flattened.

113
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,542
- Got it.

114
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:38,375
- So I,--

115
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,291
- Why, did you put
your money into the market?

116
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,125
- Everything, yeah.

117
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,500
So I was, because I,--
- Was that?

118
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,125
- Yeah because you,--
- Because Seattle, mmm.

119
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,417
- At that age, well, I didn't,

120
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:46,500
all I knew is that when
I graduated from college,

121
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,333
everything you touch didn't,--
- Which was what year?

122
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,458
- '93.

123
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:50,917
- Okay, so you're
five years older than me.

124
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:51,458
Go ahead.

125
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,750
- Everything you
touch turns to gold.

126
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,166
You buy InfoSpace at
five and in seven days,

127
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,667
it was at 75, so I knew,--

128
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:57,750
- This is interesting timing.

129
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,959
- I was going to, and
it actually, you know,

130
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,458
I thought I was going
to retire at age 27, 28.

131
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,000
- So you were making
good money at a corporate job,

132
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,166
taking the money and
investing in the market

133
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,959
and making a killing.

134
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,500
- Killing for me.

135
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,542
- For you, correct.

136
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:14,500
- For me, it was
- I'm not even trying,

137
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,083
but you know, listen.

138
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,666
Buying stocks at
five that go to 170,

139
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,625
even if you put in $10,000,
you're making real money.

140
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,666
- Plus, the rush
of how that feels.

141
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,500
I'm so smart.
- So, what, were you?

142
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,375
Listen, it's
funny because I, again,

143
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,125
I keep yelling at all
these kids on Instagram

144
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,792
that life's too good right now.

145
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:31,291
When this crashes,
shit's going to get weird.

146
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,667
Were you, I forgot about this.

147
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:33,750
This actually reminded me.

148
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,708
Were you at a place
where you had your job,

149
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,083
but you were
struggling to even focus on it

150
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,041
because you kept
looking at Yahoo Finance

151
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,208
and watching the money?
- Yeah, oh yeah.

152
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,250
- Yeah.
- Refresh, refresh.

153
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,375
- Guys,
- Refresh.

154
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,875
- Doo, doo, doo, doo.
- You were watching your stocks

155
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,250
and every time my stock went up,

156
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,458
I was like, a
little bit happier.

157
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,834
I was a little bit smarter.

158
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:49,625
I was a little bit,--

159
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,542
- You thought you
were a real genius?

160
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:51,667
- I was closer to retirement,

161
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,041
but when my stock went down,

162
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,208
I started to get pissed.

163
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,000
(Gary laughs)

164
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,875
I started to maybe
not treat people as well.

165
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,250
And it was like losing a sale,

166
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,875
was when my stock went down.

167
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,708
And it then, it
all went down and,--

168
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:05,959
- Are we talking about 2000?

169
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,834
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it burned.

170
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:09,875
- And so, I got destroyed.
- Hammered.

171
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:10,542
- I got destroyed.
- So what happened?

172
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:11,542
- It was like a shark attack.

173
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:13,083
- Were you
married at this point?

174
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:13,750
- Yeah, to that,
- Yeah, I know.

175
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,500
I know, I see her.

176
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,166
- To that beautiful
woman right there. 22 years.

177
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,041
- So wait, you like, literally,

178
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,208
it was April, right?

179
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,458
It was April, so what?

180
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,208
You just come
home and like, "Fuck"?

181
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,959
- Well, it felt like that,

182
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,208
but it lasted a lot longer.

183
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,667
So the suffering, first of all,

184
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:27,834
you lose everything,

185
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:30,333
then you think
about everything you lost

186
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,917
and then you just walk
around the house at night

187
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:35,417
because you can't sleep
because everything that I was

188
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,125
was wrapped up--
- In the success of that.

189
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,041
- In the success
of that and the money,

190
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,208
my security.
- Your self-worth, yeah.

191
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,083
- I was addicted to security.

192
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,625
- Redaction of
security of those finances.

193
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,208
- Yeah, and so
when that was taken away

194
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,375
and they said,
I basically had to start over

195
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,542
at ground zero.

196
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:50,667
That was really depressing.
- With three little kids.

197
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:52,166
- With three little kids.
- [Woman] Yeah.

198
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,917
- And no money.
- Did you have, yeah.

199
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:55,708
And what, did you have mortgages
and all that good stuff?

200
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:56,834
- Oh, yeah.
- [Woman] Yeah.

201
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:57,667
- So what happened?

202
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:58,500
(Erik laughs)

203
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,333
- So,--

204
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,083
- So wait, did you
lose the consultant,

205
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,041
did you lose the
job you had, too?

206
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,166
- I left the job
because that dried up.

207
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,000
- Because you
were just like, yeah.

208
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,250
- Yeah, what I did was,
I brokered entertainment

209
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:05,959
and so, at that time,

210
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,583
- Well, this is
the thing that, again,

211
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,542
like listen, we're
going a little somber start.

212
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:10,542
It will get better.
(Erik laughs)

213
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:12,000
But I want
everybody to pay attention

214
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,291
because you guys know
that I've been on this kick

215
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,125
that this good
times can't last forever.

216
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,542
It's not only that
you don't get paid $8,000

217
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:21,208
to take a photo in your
Instagram with a fucking tea

218
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,667
or thing like that.

219
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:24,417
You also actually
lose your other job.

220
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,583
So like, who else?

221
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,250
So, somebody making a
buck 30 a year right now,

222
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,583
24 years old doing
sponsored posts on Instagram

223
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,750
around clothing brands,
and fruit, and protein shakes,

224
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,417
it's not only that you lose that

225
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:37,750
because the
brands dollars shred up

226
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,542
when the economy goes soft,

227
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:41,625
it's that when you
then go to get a job,

228
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,750
those jobs aren't there either.

229
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,750
Like, it goes from here to here.

230
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,458
- And you're balancing,
I was balancing my ego

231
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,708
in this as well.

232
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,166
So my ego,--
- Well, what you think

233
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,917
is wrapped up and when you
say in your Instagram profile

234
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:56,959
you're an influencer and
you're traveling to Ibiza

235
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,834
and Coachella, and
telling all your friends

236
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:03,333
that you're making $180,000,
$400,000, $1 million a year.

237
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,000
- They expect that
of you in perpetuity,

238
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,875
and if you can't
showcase it all the time,

239
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,291
all the sudden 
you start to feel less.

240
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,792
I felt less.

241
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:13,041
It was a very difficult time.

242
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,083
So let's bounce from there.
- Let's go.

243
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,250
- That's where I,
- I want to stay there

244
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,917
the whole time,
just so everybody knows

245
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:20,417
because I want you
fuckers to actually understand

246
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:22,333
what the fuck
we're talking about,

247
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,708
but we'll bounce for now.

248
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,333
- It, it--
- We'll go to this clip

249
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,917
in 16 months
when the world melts.

250
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:29,000
Go ahead.
- There you go.

251
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,708
(group laughter)

252
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,250
- So I needed to find a reason
to get up in the morning.

253
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,041
I needed to
find a reason to go on

254
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,208
and I didn't want to go back
and try and build this business

255
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,083
from zero and try and
find what I want to do

256
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,000
with the rest of my life.

257
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,417
And so, I actually
found life with other artists.

258
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:45,959
Like, other people who
had suffered a little bit,

259
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,458
I could relate to them.

260
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,959
(Gary laughs)
And they started sharing,--

261
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,250
- Suffering artists like India.

262
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,333
- Starving artists.
- Yeah.

263
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,500
- And the reason it's a
cliche is because it's true.

264
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,250
Now India's work is unbelievable

265
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,291
and she's going to be
worth millions, but there's,

266
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,208
- I agree, I agree.

267
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,250
She doesn't know this,
but I own 49% of it

268
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,959
when she signed her contract.
(India laughs)

269
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,959
Sorry, India.
Go ahead.

270
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,917
- There's actually,--
- India, you need to show her.

271
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:05,834
You got to show her.

272
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:07,667
She hasn't been on The
#AskGaryVee Show in 100 years.

273
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:08,708
- Hi.
- [Gary] Alright.

274
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,125
- India!
- For two years.

275
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,417
- India and I have
worked closely here for a while.

276
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:13,625
- So go ahead.

277
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,458
- So I've realized that
gosh, a lot of these artists

278
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,625
actually aren't that happy,

279
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,708
even though they
have these philosophies,

280
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:19,625
they don't have any income.

281
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,917
They don't have any,--
- Sure.

282
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,750
- money. They don't know how to
build traction or build a brand,

283
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,583
and so,--
- Well, they're probably

284
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,917
like India, they get
happiness out of complaining

285
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:28,250
and being starving
(Erik laughs)

286
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,041
and the negativity.

287
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,500
By the way, I'm that way too.

288
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,417
It's actually why, you
know, you want to hear this?

289
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:34,125
It's actually why I
really associate with that.

290
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,041
I like the pain of the process.

291
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:36,875
- Mhmmm.

292
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,041
- I really do, like, the
reason I keep fantasizing

293
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,125
about melting is I'm excited.

294
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,291
By the way, you think I'm
excited to fire 280 people

295
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,792
because a third of
our clients fire us?

296
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,166
You think that's
interesting to me?

297
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,583
You don't think I think
about that every day

298
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,375
in a world where we've
had nothing but growth?

299
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,625
I'm scared shitless of the
pain that's going to bring me.

300
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,917
Truth is, you have no options.

301
00:08:56,917 --> 00:09:00,000
- The way things go.

302
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,291
If you're an artist
looking to build a brand,

303
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,166
I think there is a lot to learn.

304
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,291
That's what I
found is that artists

305
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,375
did not have
that grind of learning

306
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,500
how to amplify
their brand to scale.

307
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,542
How to push
their genius out there,

308
00:09:13,542 --> 00:09:14,625
and so that's where I come--

309
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:18,417
- So you were business-y,
went to art, and then

310
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:20,417
went back to 
business-y around art.

311
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:21,500
- Right.
- I love that.

312
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,166
- And this time is
when I started to create.

313
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,291
I'd never painted before, but
it was so fascinating to me.

314
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,166
- You're so good at it!

315
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,583
No really, he is.

316
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,708
- [DRock] He's very intelligent.

317
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,166
- Are you fascinated by that?

318
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,792
One thing I tell
a lot of people is,

319
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:35,625
people ask me, what's
my passion Gary, right?

320
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,417
And I'm like, well if
you never had a hot dog,

321
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,708
would you know if
you liked eating hot dogs?

322
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,959
Did you find it,
were you confused

323
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:43,750
that you were good at it?

324
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,041
- Good is a relative term.

325
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,500
I sucked when I started,

326
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,834
but I loved the process.

327
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:49,583
I loved the idea of creating,

328
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,792
I loved the idea
of getting better.

329
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,208
Painting was
just where it kind of

330
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,375
opened up and I got branded

331
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,750
as a graffiti artist early on,

332
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,417
partly because
I loved it so much,

333
00:09:58,417 --> 00:09:59,417
I loved their philosophy,

334
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:00,959
I loved street artists,

335
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,083
and also I started doing it

336
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:02,917
and hanging out with them.

337
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:05,250
But I also started
landscape painting,

338
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,000
figure drawing, writing poetry,

339
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,458
doing photography,

340
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,667
so that was the
gateway drug to understanding

341
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,041
creativity as a whole.

342
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,917
And creativity is not
just painting or graffiti,

343
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:17,333
it's a way of life,
it's an energy.

344
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,792
- It's a mindset.
- It's a mindset.

345
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:21,875
So that's why I took
it not only into writing

346
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:25,291
and into sculpture
but also into business,

347
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,667
because business is
all about being creative.

348
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:28,542
- Of course.

349
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:29,917
- Marketing, strategy...

350
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:32,917
- So actually now I'm really
deep into the vortex of this.

351
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:34,583
So you start making shit, right?

352
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,583
You've got three
kids at home and the wife.

353
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,708
What happens?

354
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:42,667
Give me a quick five second
2000 to 2005, like,

355
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:43,708
what happened?

356
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,875
- I started writing all
these ideas that artists

357
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,750
had the genius but no
discipline to how to get

358
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,375
their message to scale.

359
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,583
Businesses had this
incredible discipline

360
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:57,583
but no disruptive
thinking or curiosity,

361
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,542
so that's where I
wrote a presentation about

362
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:01,875
how to merge the two.

363
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:02,542
I called it The Art of Vision,

364
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:04,000
started painting onstage,

365
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,208
started cranking rock music.

366
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,166
- How did you
get your first gig?

367
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,083
- Marketing. Hustling.

368
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:13,708
My wife and I created
a manufactured brochure.

369
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:17,250
We taped a presentation,
so we asked a local college,

370
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,291
hey can we come and
deliver a presentation for free.

371
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,875
- How much did they pay you?

372
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,417
- We got paid zero.

373
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:25,834
And we also paid a film
crew to come and film us.

374
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:26,667
- Negative!

375
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,875
- And make it look like,
make it look like this is

376
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:29,750
something that it isn't.

377
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,792
- How many presentations
did you give for free

378
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,875
in the early days?

379
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,875
- Fortunately, and I know
where you're going with this...

380
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,125
- But that's
okay, I want your truth,

381
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,792
I don't want you to
appease my strategy.

382
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:42,000
- Yeah, I did probably three.

383
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,291
- No, no you have to understand.

384
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,417
Enormous amounts of
people feel like that's

385
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:48,125
three too many.

386
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,208
- If you want to be
a professional speaker,

387
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,125
you should be doing
hundreds of present--

388
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,917
- If you want to be
a professional anything

389
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:56,542
that nobody else
wants to pay you for,

390
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:58,875
you should do it for free.

391
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,083
That's your
only way of doing it.

392
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,125
- When I first spoke, I sucked!

393
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,875
My wife was super...

394
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,250
- Disappointed in you?

395
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,625
- She was super supportive.

396
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,458
(woman laughs)

397
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,959
- She's like "You suck"!

398
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,291
- Somehow she
was able to muster,

399
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,959
instead of saying "You
suck", she still was able

400
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,417
to say, "Let's go Hon".

401
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:17,834
So I felt
affirmed, I'm like okay--

402
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:19,708
- But she's more
glass half full, right?

403
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,291
And you're more
glass half empty.

404
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,208
- I would say so.

405
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,792
- I know you guys, not
that you're so horrible,

406
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:27,458
but I mean she is
a little bit more,

407
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,625
like her natural
reaction is a little bit

408
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,583
more positive.

409
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,667
- She's my Yoko Ono.

410
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,250
So I'm this kind of
confused John Lennon.

411
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,125
I've got ideas but
insecure about putting them

412
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,625
out there.
That's the truth.

413
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,583
She's always been
behind me and pushing

414
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,041
that out there,
like "You know what?

415
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,083
"I think this is
gonna be awesome.

416
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,208
"You know what?
They're gonna go for this".

417
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,875
And so I had a lot of
support and encouragement

418
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,333
early on from her,
and I ended up doing

419
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,750
a presentation.

420
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,583
She hustled for
me to speak to some

421
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,083
American healthcare association,

422
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,583
kind of a national meeting,

423
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,041
and inside there's 50
state associations, so--

424
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,250
- And that blew it up!

425
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,375
- It's kind of
like hitting the lotto.

426
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,208
- That was the moment.

427
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,041
- [Woman] That was the moment,

428
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,208
and you just kind
of learn as you go.

429
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:03,959
- Yeah a hundred percent.

430
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,458
- [Woman] What's the
best way is you start

431
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,291
big and you go
backwards, you reverse engineer.

432
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,083
- Hundred percent.

433
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,291
We're about to
get into a phone call.

434
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,417
I want to do two things
before we get there, Andy.

435
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,333
Oh you're Facebook, Instagram,
start putting your phone...

436
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,500
Oh you're doing Facebook!

437
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,333
Instagram, sorry.

438
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,083
Facebook Live is doing
the phone numbers this time.

439
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,208
Please post your phone numbers

440
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,208
and we will call somebody.

441
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,458
- I wanna make one
connection really quick.

442
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,417
- You're gonna be
able to do that for sure.

443
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:27,667
I got two other
things before we do calls.

444
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:28,667
Go ahead, you start.

445
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:30,083
- Okay. You gave a
presentation in Dublin

446
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,041
called Clouds and Dirt?

447
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:31,834
- Yes.

448
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:33,792
- That is the
spark and the grind.

449
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:35,917
It is the idea and execution.

450
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:37,875
- Wait you just wrote
the Clouds and Dirt book

451
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,208
that I've been
wanting to write one day?

452
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,208
I'm very upset right now!

453
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,166
- I beat you to market.

454
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:42,959
- Is that the spiel?

455
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:43,959
- That is exactly
it, and that's why

456
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:45,542
I brought Rodin's Thinker,
because he's a man

457
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:48,583
of great muscularity,
so it's not just this sage,

458
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,542
he's a doer, and so he's
kind of been my little mascot

459
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,041
that I've been
bringing around with me.

460
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,208
- This one.
- Yes, the Heisman trophy.

461
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:59,041
- And so this, why don't
we study for another second

462
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,375
the book.

463
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,125
You've written several books?

464
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,125
- This is my second
major published release.

465
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,875
- And did some direct
to consumer stuff before,

466
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,708
but you feel like
this is your second book.

467
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:08,417
- This is my second baby.

468
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:10,542
- How do you feel
that process has been?

469
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:11,750
This is your second book.

470
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,917
How do you
compare it to your first?

471
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:14,166
What do you
think you did better?

472
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,625
What's different, da da da...

473
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,250
- The writing
process was similar

474
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,166
in that I love it.
I love the grind of writing.

475
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,834
- You love writing?
- I love writing.

476
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:21,959
- I hate writing.

477
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:22,875
I don't write.

478
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,750
- What I don't
like is the marketing.

479
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,500
The fact that I've gotta like,

480
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,125
Hey everyone...

481
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:32,583
I actually don't care--
- You hate selling?

482
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,333
- I know you love selling--

483
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,166
- No, no, be careful.

484
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,959
I've said this, some of
you that really know me,

485
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:40,208
I actually hate microselling.

486
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,917
The way I like selling
is giving so much value,

487
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,250
and building so much brand,

488
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,834
that it's sold before,

489
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:46,834
I hate selling.

490
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:50,959
I actually decided not
to raise a fund last year.

491
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,750
I was raising a big fund,
Vayner Capital, a new fund.

492
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,959
And I stopped 'cause
I so disliked asking

493
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,166
people for money.
- I hear you.

494
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,708
- I hate it. I hate selling.

495
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,458
I hate it.

496
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,792
- I hate the fact that
this is tipped up like this

497
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:04,542
like we're trying to pimp it.

498
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:05,959
- I agree. No, no--
- I would prefer--

499
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:07,875
- Like, yeah.
- Let's put those over there.

500
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,917
Let's just talk--
- I agree.

501
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:11,375
- We'll let the
thinker stand in--

502
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,375
- I agree. I get it.

503
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,917
I mean, every time
when I'm on book tour

504
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:14,959
and I'm doing
something like this,

505
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,417
they're like,
"Why don't you tell us

506
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,458
"why they should buy the book?"

507
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,792
I'm like, "They shouldn't!"
- Yeah.

508
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,875
(group laughter)
- Don't buy it!

509
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,667
- I'm not interested in going
through chapter by chapter

510
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:23,708
or anything about that book.

511
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:24,750
It's the brand.

512
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,792
That's one channel of my brand.

513
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,500
- By the way, I'm thinking
about calling it "Crushing It."

514
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,375
Not "Crushed It."

515
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,834
I'm writing my next
one called "Crushing It."

516
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:31,792
- Okay.
- It's a follow up.

517
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:33,917
And the process, but I
do it totally different.

518
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:34,750
I have a ghost writer.

519
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,041
I'm recording it,
like doing interviews,

520
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:40,375
sliding down icy driveways
in Colorado while I do it,

521
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,959
but I was curious how
everybody's different process.

522
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,792
I'm always curious
about the second time.

523
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:46,125
- So, mine is a verbal vomit.

524
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,708
I write every single day.

525
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,291
That's what I do.
That's how I process thought.

526
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,291
That's how I think.

527
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,000
So, I write, write, write.

528
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,041
It's called a verbal vomit.

529
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,583
And then I send it to editors.

530
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,667
(Gary murmurs) And
like, Random House.

531
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:56,875
- Yeah, yeah.
- And they're incredible,

532
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,333
because they put it in
bite-sized chunks

533
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,000
where consumers are like,
"Oh, yeah. That makes sense.

534
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,708
"Oh yeah, That makes sense."

535
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,083
But when I think,
I'm just writing.

536
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:03,625
So that's what it is.

537
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,417
- You have an ungodly
amount of 20 to 25-year-old

538
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:09,500
entrepreneurs,
wannabe entrepreneurs,

539
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,959
and we have the full gamut,

540
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,208
but growth on
Instagram for me has translated

541
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,083
to a much younger audience.

542
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,375
What do you want to tell
those characters right now?

543
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,166
Let's do our first phone call.

544
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,959
What's on your
mind for that demo?

545
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,125
I know this is generalizing.

546
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,375
- That structure
creates freedom.

547
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,166
So, that's kind of
the paradox of creativity

548
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,000
or innovation.

549
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,458
That discipline and
routine and hard work

550
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,125
is what makes way
for constant creativity.

551
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,625
And then, of course, patience.

552
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,208
- You agree with that?

553
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,083
- I'm living that.

554
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,500
It's more than just agreeing.

555
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,834
- It's not something
that came natural to you

556
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:43,875
in your younger age?

557
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:44,708
- Patience?

558
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,417
(woman laughter)
No, no.

559
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:47,875
I'm an alpha dog.

560
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,792
- But I am, and
patience comes very easy to me.

561
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:51,875
- That's awesome.
- I do both.

562
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,542
- And that's awesome for you.

563
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:57,041
I've learned more
patience in the last 12 months

564
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,000
than I've had to
endure my entire life--

565
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,708
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

566
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,166
Before we go
into this phone call,

567
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,291
I'm sorry there.

568
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,417
In the last 12 months?

569
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:04,875
- Yeah. Should I
get comfy on the couch?

570
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:05,540
- Yeah.

571
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,082
- Do the psychology thing?
- You intrigued me before we--

572
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:08,915
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

573
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:10,874
Tell me that.

574
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:14,790
- That I thought my
brand was gonna launch.

575
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,915
I thought that I've
done the 10, 12 years

576
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:21,415
of hard ass work, slaving
away doing 100 shows a year--

577
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,582
- Mmhmm.
- Logging 250,000 miles--

578
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,583
- That as soon as
you went out, weirdly,

579
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,250
and did the
videos and all this--

580
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,375
- [Woman] Yeah.

581
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,792
- Dude. Shit, man.

582
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:32,083
That makes me so,

583
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:32,917
so, I don't know
if you know this,

584
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,750
but I have a TV show coming.
- I do.

585
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,208
- I'm convinced it is
not gonna be the thing

586
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,583
that people think it's gonna be.

587
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,458
It's Apple,
it's tens of millions

588
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,041
of dollars in marketing.

589
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:47,625
I think my ecosystem
thinks it's gonna be the moment

590
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,875
that I become
massively mainstream famous

591
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:54,166
and I already know that
it's not going to be that.

592
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,750
It'll be another piece.
- Mhmmm.

593
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:00,083
- But the
punchline is, it happens.

594
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,750
Simon Cowell, it happened.

595
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,000
It happens.

596
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,166
But I get it, man.

597
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,250
And I think
about it all the time.

598
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,792
The amount of times
this was gonna be the thing

599
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:09,542
that changes my career.

600
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:11,583
Remember Facebook video?

601
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,542
We had the inside
track on Facebook video.

602
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,792
Like, "This is
gonna be the thing!"

603
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:16,625
You know?

604
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,458
Like the other thing were
working on at the same time?

605
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,875
It's never the thing.

606
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,208
- I've gone
through a lot of suffering

607
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,583
to learn how to be patient,

608
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:28,083
to realize this will
take time on setbacks.

609
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,458
This too shall pass.

610
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,667
And all of those
are building resiliency

611
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:33,333
for wherever this thing goes.

612
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,667
And I don't know that
there is such thing as,

613
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:36,625
you say there's no such thing
as an overnight success,

614
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:40,125
but I wonder Malcolm Gladwell's
tipping point.

615
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,667
I'm waiting for that.

616
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:43,750
'Cause I feel like I've
done a lot of this backfill.

617
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,000
When does it tip?

618
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,750
When do you, "Ah! That was
sweet. That was the moment."

619
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,417
- So, I think
the question becomes,

620
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:50,291
"Are you able to
reframe your brain into

621
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,542
"that same place when you
were learning how to create?"

622
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:53,375
- Mhmmm.
- Yeah.

623
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,834
- You need to figure out how
much do you love this journey

624
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:59,625
and how you actually
change it to love it more

625
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,291
if you're yearning
for the tipping point.

626
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,417
I would tell you that I'm
sitting here psychoanalyzing

627
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:06,291
myself in parallel
to you and saying,

628
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,166
"Or am I secretly
hopeful that the Apple show

629
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,917
"won't work so big?"

630
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,417
Because I do love the grind.

631
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:14,708
I like losing.

632
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,417
Let me give you an example.

633
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:17,792
Tony Robbins was
here the other day.

634
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:18,625
- Yep.
- Right?

635
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,291
- I saw it.

636
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,083
10,000 viewers on Facebook.
- Yep, right.

637
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,875
- That was insane.
- Yep. Ready for this?

638
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,125
Ungodly amounts of
comments that I suck shit

639
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,291
because I
interrupt when I interview.

640
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:30,041
You would not
believe how much I love that.

641
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,500
I love when people
call out my shortcomings.

642
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,583
Perceived shortcomings!

643
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,792
Tony Robbins has eight
trillion interviews out there.

644
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:39,208
If you wanna go watch
or listen to an interview

645
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,458
where the person
doesn't interrupt them?

646
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,208
Mazel Tov.

647
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,166
I've got my style of my show.

648
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,375
It's free.

649
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,667
And I need to do it my way,

650
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:47,667
but it was funny.

651
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:49,625
I read them all.

652
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:50,625
- Yeah.

653
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,208
- During my little
pockets over the weekend,

654
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,333
I read them all.

655
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,166
All of them.

656
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,208
Every Facebook and
YouTube comment that says,

657
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,417
"Shut up, Gary. What the fuck?

658
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:59,166
"You're a douchebag. I hate you.

659
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,250
"You suck shit."

660
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,333
And I'm like,
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."

661
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,792
(mimics eating)
More.

662
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:06,959
I love the process of losing
in a world where I'm alpha

663
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,500
and want to win
more than anything.

664
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,959
- I'm still learning that.

665
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,583
I am emotional.

666
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,708
I'm an artist.

667
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,125
I look at trollers or haters.
- Yes.

668
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,458
- And I'm like (groans).

669
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:19,000
- Yeah, to me, I pet
their little, fluffy hair

670
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,583
and go, "I'm listening to you."

671
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,166
By the way, I'm empathetic.

672
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,125
This is live.

673
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,792
This is super live.

674
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:26,083
Super no-edited.

675
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,792
It's not the only
thing I do in my life.

676
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:29,375
I'm not a professional
podcaster that makes

677
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,333
one fucking video once a week

678
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,208
and sit cozy in my
booth and have unlimited time

679
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:37,542
and it's the only fucking
thing I'm doing that day.

680
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:38,750
Sorry, was that--

681
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,500
- It's a channel--
(laughter)

682
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,542
- But--
- Oh my word!

683
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:47,333
- I do think that the
battle scars are attractive.

684
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,667
- They're what make
the joys that much higher.

685
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:51,417
So, I don't know that
success would feel as good

686
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,166
if you didn't feel
the pain along the way.

687
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,708
- I think when
I'm listening to you--

688
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,542
- [DRock] Brendon Marshall
just texted me and said,

689
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:00,708
"You interrupt a lot."

690
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,041
- Brandon Marshall did.

691
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,000
I love Brandon, but
now I don't care about

692
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,625
Brandon Marshall's feedback
because he's not a Jet anymore.

693
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,208
Brandon, you only have
so much weight with me.

694
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,041
- That's the
Jet's wide receiver,

695
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,250
for anyone who
doesn't know that.

696
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,708
That's cool, hey
Brandon, what's up?

697
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,834
- It's my natural feeling,
I go fast, I anticipate,

698
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:16,625
and I know it's not
enjoyable to watch at all times,

699
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,917
and I'm empathetic
and I do apologize,

700
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:20,375
but I just can't not be me.

701
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,834
And I think this
goes back to where

702
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:22,750
I was actually going with this,

703
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,625
which is the
greatest thing to hack is

704
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:29,083
figure out what parts
don't make the journey exciting

705
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,250
and either fix
them or cut them out

706
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,917
cause you lose otherwise.

707
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,083
- And to love the journey.

708
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:37,917
Like I realize at
this point in my career,

709
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:39,500
if I don't love what I'm doing,

710
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,667
(phone rings)

711
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:43,375
I'm not gonna grind at it,
so I love the hard work,

712
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,291
I do too.

713
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,417
(phone rings)
- Who is this?

714
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,959
- [Andy] Blake.

715
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:48,708
- [Blake] Hello.

716
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,166
- Blake, it's Gary Vaynerchuk
and you're on

717
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:53,083
The #AskGaryVee Show
with Erik Wahl.

718
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,333
- [Blake] Get out of here.

719
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,959
- You made it Blake.

720
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:58,166
Where you from and
what's your question?

721
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,834
- [Blake] Wow, from Harrisburg,
Hershey, Pennsylvania,

722
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:02,208
chocolate-town USA

723
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,166
- Very nice.

724
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,458
- What's your name,

725
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,959
your name's Blink?
- Blake

726
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:06,792
- Blake.

727
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:10,583
Dude, my great, great
grandfather is Carlton Hershey,

728
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,166
invented the
Hershey bar long ago.

729
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,375
- The hell we doing here?

730
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,708
- So, shout out (crosstalk)

731
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,834
shouldn't there be
some royalties, right?

732
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:19,792
No, so anyway, cool,

733
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:21,542
I'm glad you're
calling from Hershey, PA.

734
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:23,000
- Blake, let's do it.

735
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,667
- [Blake] Sure,
well you talk a lot about

736
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:28,375
documenting the journey,

737
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,291
and you know,

738
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:34,166
I was trying to figure out,
the chicken or the egg here.

739
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:38,000
You know you talk
about starting and just doing

740
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,291
and going for it,
but then you talk about

741
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:44,458
how you didn't start talking
until you actually built,

742
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,708
you know, built a
business and built brand

743
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:49,875
and built awareness, but you
were quiet for quite some time.

744
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,166
So Gary, the chicken or the egg?

745
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:53,875
Which one do we do when we
try to build a personal brand?

746
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:57,500
- I'm glad you asked that,
because there's a very strong

747
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,333
clarification here that you'll
give to the whole audience

748
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:03,250
if they're confused and I can
see how they'd be confused.

749
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,375
I would've started documenting
the Wine Library journey,

750
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,291
but I wouldn't have at 22,

751
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:11,500
come out and said
I was a business expert

752
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,917
because I hadn't successfully
built a huge business,

753
00:23:13,917 --> 00:23:15,750
so I would have
documented being,

754
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,291
"Hey guys, this is
22-year-old GaryVee,

755
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,166
"I think that I'm going
to be really successful

756
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,625
"because for the
last eight years,

757
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:23,083
"I've been
selling baseball cards,

758
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,834
"I've been in my dad's
business, I think got this,

759
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:28,125
"the internet's going
to be big, you'll see it."

760
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:31,750
So I would have been
documenting my truth when I say

761
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,333
I didn't come out
and talk until I did,

762
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:37,375
as an authority worthwhile
of writing business books

763
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,542
that I thought
people should have followed,

764
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:41,375
and so that's the clarification.

765
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,125
I would have
documented the early days

766
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,792
of my entrepreneurship.

767
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:47,708
What happened
instead was, I became,

768
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,708
I felt comfortable
coming out as an authority

769
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:53,000
because I had serious
business success at that point.

770
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,542
Does that make sense?

771
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,250
- [Blake] Yeah,
I understand that.

772
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,375
- So, I think you can
choose one or the other.

773
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,708
I would recommend
the documenting,

774
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:03,875
because if you're willing to
do it, the upside is extreme.

775
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,125
It gives you another
place where you might

776
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:09,250
be able to be successful
in or I'll for example,

777
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,917
I think Wine Library would
have done a lot more revenue,

778
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,667
if there were also
tens of thousands of people

779
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,917
following my journey
of building the store,

780
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:17,208
they would have come and visited

781
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,166
because they would have thought
the 25-year-old punk kid

782
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,625
was interesting and intriguing,

783
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,917
so it would have had
greater reach along the way.

784
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:25,542
- I want to also say, Blake,

785
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:28,208
I think you learn
a lot my documenting.

786
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,917
So just by the
process of documenting,

787
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:31,834
your mind is
working differently than

788
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:33,291
if you're just on
to the next product.

789
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:34,291
- What happened when you--
- Documenting--

790
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:35,625
- So, you started
documenting behind the wall,

791
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:38,041
I know it's
ideated across the way,

792
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,792
it's like what were
the biggest eye openers

793
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:41,750
when you started doing
the vlog in your world.

794
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,625
- That I sucked at it.

795
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:45,291
That I knew I was
good live on stage

796
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:46,875
when I could see the
whites of people's eyes,

797
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,500
and I could adjust,
but behind the camera,

798
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,875
when someone said,
"Action," or "Now you're on,"

799
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:53,917
I would tense up and
I would become less authentic.

800
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:56,750
So for me, it was just
massaging through the fact

801
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:00,959
that I'm not that
strong yet at being on camera.

802
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,917
- Did winning in artistry
and getting better at that

803
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:05,875
give you like a quiet confidence
in the back of your head

804
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:07,708
because you solved that thing?

805
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:09,041
- No, it was a hook.

806
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,542
Art was more therapy,
I use art in the presentations

807
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:13,250
because people think it's cool.

808
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,375
But for me, it's a
sanctuary back in my studio

809
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:17,166
just to grow, but
it's also documenting,

810
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:18,750
that's why I write, to document.

811
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,959
- Blake, I think
the key is always

812
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:21,291
reverse engineering yourself.

813
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:23,625
I think the fact that we're
capable of today's technologies

814
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,208
to document is really cool.

815
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:26,583
To be very frank with you,

816
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,208
one thing that I
also want to throw out is,

817
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:28,750
I think people are

818
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,083
underestimating 
the documentation

819
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:33,417
of their lives and the
impact on their families.

820
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:35,166
I would tell you, no question,

821
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,250
the coolest thing
from documenting all this

822
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,375
and what I'm doing,
is the amount of content

823
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:42,041
my great, great-grandkids are
going to have in watching me,

824
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,291
and seeing the similarities
in their DNA and me.

825
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:45,667
Like it just cool, like having,

826
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,667
I don't have a
lot of family photos.

827
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:50,625
I know nothing about my two,
when I tell you I know nothing

828
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:53,041
about my two grandfathers,
I know nothing.

829
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:54,708
And so, like, I
think there's some cool,

830
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:56,500
the documenting is a
lot cooler than you think,

831
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,166
just from that part, let
alone the business impact

832
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:00,166
it has in the short term.

833
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:02,208
- We also talk, we opened the
show kind of talking about

834
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:05,166
Ibiza and the couple
hundred grand and private jets

835
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:07,083
and that's one thing for
Instagram and social media,

836
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:09,834
but to actually see
people who aren't winning yet,

837
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:13,000
to watch the process,
the challenge,

838
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,750
that documenting
I think is as interesting,

839
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,375
if not more interesting
that the actual bling bling.

840
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:22,333
- So Blake, I think you could
document the journey now,

841
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:24,250
and that would be cool
and it has it's upside,

842
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,375
or if it's more
interesting for you,

843
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:27,500
you put your head
down for a decade,

844
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,959
and if you want to
come out as an expert,

845
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,458
you come out after
you've already won,

846
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,625
cause it's a lot
more fun to talk shit

847
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,875
once you've
accomplished something.

848
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:36,291
- [Blake] Exactly,
I'm trying to do both,

849
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:37,250
so I appreciate that.

850
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,041
I knew you also
said that, you know,

851
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:42,041
instead of putting
like CEO in your profile,

852
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:44,125
put like "aspiring artist"
or something like that,

853
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:45,625
so how do you build credibility

854
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:47,917
if you're aspiring while trying.

855
00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:49,792
- You don't, you
don't deserve credibility

856
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:52,041
if you haven't accomplished.

857
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:52,959
- [Blake] Okay.

858
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:55,041
- You may, you might
become fascinating to somebody

859
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:58,542
with your bravado of
predicting your accomplishments,

860
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:00,000
but people are
trying to get credibility

861
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,417
before they've earned it,

862
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:03,667
and they think some way they
can create a facade for it,

863
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:05,041
and that's my
fucking problem with it,

864
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,375
because it's undermining you.

865
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,083
You may trick the 10% losers,

866
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:13,041
but you've lost
with the 10% winners.

867
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:14,417
- [Blake] I'm with you,
I'm with you.

868
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:16,041
Just want to make sure
I've got confirmation on it.

869
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:17,041
- No worries brother.

870
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:18,667
Let's move it along
because I know we're,

871
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:20,667
time limit constraints.

872
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:23,208
I don't want to get
yelled at for interrupting.

873
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,667
- If you're an aspiring artist,

874
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:28,834
don't race to commoditize.

875
00:27:28,834 --> 00:27:31,291
Keep working the
brand building the brand,

876
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:33,875
you might lose
authenticity if you try

877
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:35,417
to commoditize too early.

878
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:39,458
So aspiring artist,
stay hungry, build the brand,

879
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,875
but don't, be careful
about when you turn

880
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,834
and try and
turn into a business,

881
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:46,500
because you could lose
some of your authenticity.

882
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,750
- 100%.

883
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,166
(phone ringing)
- [Andy] Randy.

884
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:51,083
- Randy?

885
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,583
- [Andy] I'm going
through exactly what it...

886
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:54,500
- Well this is right.

887
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,959
- [Andy] We'll see.

888
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
- Randy this is Gary,

889
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,959
Randy this is
Gary Vaynerchuck,

890
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:01,583
you're on The #AskGaryVee Show.

891
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:02,834
- [Randy]
What's up GaryVee?

892
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:06,500
Shout out to DRock
first off, Mark and Gary.

893
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:08,417
(radio feedback on phone)

894
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:11,667
Oh my god, I'm gonna need
to turn this off real quick.

895
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:13,708
Alright, sorry,
sorry about that.

896
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:16,041
My question to
you is, I've created

897
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:19,750
what I believe to
be a high end brand.

898
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,834
It doesn't have a
whole lot of followers,

899
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,917
but it's hard for
me to position myself

900
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:27,083
to create another brand

901
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:28,291
that will help
support me through this.

902
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,458
Because I'm doing
photography and video,

903
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,250
which is why I
shouted out to everybody

904
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,959
that's using the Sonys there.

905
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:34,875
Like what should I do?

906
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:36,000
I've been doing
this for 10 years,

907
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,583
I haven't really gotten
a whole lot of traction.

908
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:42,500
I've been struggling, and
I need to know what to do.

909
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,083
- Eric?
- Yeah.

910
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:48,667
First of all, the,
in photography, there's--

911
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:51,250
- [Randy] Excuse me, 
I apologize because you know,

912
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,333
I do photography,
video, and websites.

913
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:55,083
But more photography and video.

914
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,500
- What do you want to
happen, before Eric answers it?

915
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,542
Like what do you want to happen?

916
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:00,458
Do you have a side job,
do you have a regular job?

917
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:01,333
Is this your side job?

918
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:04,875
- [Randy] No, no, no,
this is all I've wanted to do

919
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:07,875
I used to do club flyers,
so my friend used to,

920
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:10,417
he used to own the club by
the street, he got shut down.

921
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:13,083
And after doing
club flyers for awhile,

922
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:15,500
I realized I hated flyers.

923
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,708
So I got into--
- Don't blame him

924
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,458
- [Randy] I really
hate doing flyers.

925
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:22,417
So I decided to do
photography and videography,

926
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:25,583
it comes easier to me,
and if you check out my work,

927
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:28,208
you actually
messaged me back one time.

928
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:31,125
And it's really good, I'm
not one to toot my own horn,

929
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,417
but a lot of people like it.

930
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:34,333
But not enough
to sustain a living.

931
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:36,917
What I really want to happen
out of this, is a roadmap.

932
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:38,708
Because I've
actually looked for a mentor,

933
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:40,542
not in
photography, video aspect,

934
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:43,333
but on the
business side of that stuff,

935
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,959
because like, I was
transitioning to marketing.

936
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:46,750
- Do you think that,
do you think you need

937
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,000
a business
partner that understands

938
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,542
how to do the business part,
and that you're the creative?

939
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:53,375
- [Randy] There's not 
enough upside

940
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,875
for them to come in, 
and I live at

941
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,417
a local college down the street.

942
00:29:57,417 --> 00:29:58,250
- Sounds like an artist.

943
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,917
- [Randy] Even for
the internships,

944
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:01,708
they'll like,
they'll learn what I teach,

945
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:03,250
what I teach really well,

946
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,875
and then they'll just
take off on their own.

947
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:08,417
Which is great because, I
taught somebody really well

948
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:10,959
how to get to at
least where I am,

949
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:12,792
but it's not enough upside

950
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:16,083
for somebody to come
in and say hey, whatever.

951
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:18,375
- Do you love photography?

952
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:23,542
Like if you hit the
lotto this afternoon,

953
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:28,166
would you do
photography next week?

954
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:30,458
- [Randy] Would I do,
if I hit the lotto,

955
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:32,875
I would, and I'm
at the point where--

956
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,583
- Tell the truth.

957
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:35,333
- [Randy] Huh?

958
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,875
- Tell me the truth
about this lotto question.

959
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:38,834
Five million dollars.

960
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:41,708
- [Randy] Yes, if
I won five million dollars,

961
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:43,542
they invest in what
you know, Warren Buffet,

962
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:46,500
and you said it yourself, I
can only invest in what I know,

963
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,834
I'd be stupid to throw my
money into something else.

964
00:30:48,834 --> 00:30:50,750
So yes, it'd be
photography and videography.

965
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:54,083
I'd love to build a
building beside you.

966
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:57,333
I understand your concept of
looking to build a building

967
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,959
and not worrying
about everybody else,

968
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,917
not destroying
everybody else's building.

969
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:02,750
I'd be up under
you somewhere else.

970
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,792
I'm not saying I'm gonna
be the next Gary Vaynerchuck

971
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:06,041
because I don't
have enough energy.

972
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:07,500
Because I pray,
but for the love of god

973
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,291
I do not understand how
you're not on self meds,

974
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:12,333
Jesus Fucking Christ, you
have a shit ton of energy.

975
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:15,041
I'm really sick of it
- I do.

976
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,500
- [Randy] You've got to
tell me how you do it.

977
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,083
I don't know if it's
the Russian Jewish thing,

978
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:21,250
I don't know, either way.

979
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:25,417
My idea is that photography
and videography by itself

980
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:30,083
is not enough, considering
the saturation of the market

981
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:31,583
to actually sustain a living.

982
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:34,792
So I started to put my
photography and videography

983
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:36,875
in places where it
could be more useful,

984
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:37,959
i.e. the marketing side.

985
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,750
This is what this
picture can do for you,

986
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,333
versus here's a nice picture.

987
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:42,333
You're like, oh I'll just put it

988
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,959
on my Facebook on my Instagram,

989
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:45,125
and then hope
they some attraction.

990
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:46,458
- What's his name?

991
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:47,667
- [Randy] That's what
I've been doing,

992
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:48,834
and I've been talking to people.

993
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:51,625
I just talked to a lady
who has a younger--

994
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:53,458
- Hey Randy, Ran, Ran

995
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:56,875
First of all, your energy
excites me (group laughter)

996
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,667
so I think you
have so many, listen

997
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,834
let's let, you know
I kinda let you go here

998
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:04,417
just for kind of like
show, to be very frank,

999
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:06,417
let's pull this back in.

1000
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:11,291
So you're
trying to make a living

1001
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:14,166
creating for clients,
is that correct?

1002
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,083
- [Randy] Absolutely.

1003
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:18,041
- How much time do you spend
trying to get new clients?

1004
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:20,250
And don't bullshit me
Randy, because I will hang up.

1005
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:24,375
How much time every
day, do you spend DMing,

1006
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:28,041
do you spend creating a
brochure and hanging it,

1007
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:30,583
or putting it on somebody,
I'm gonna remind everybody,

1008
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:32,750
me printing flyers and
going to the Short Hills Mall

1009
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,458
and putting it on people's
cars, because I had no money.

1010
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:37,125
Everybody thinks
it's easy, once it like,

1011
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,125
no, no we all
start out at zippo.

1012
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,458
Like, how much
time are you spending

1013
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:44,625
trying to get
clients, for real, daily?

1014
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:47,166
Don't bullshit
me, don't bullshit me.

1015
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:50,458
- [Randy] I'm spending
two hours doing it,

1016
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:53,417
because I have so much content
that I have to get out.

1017
00:32:53,417 --> 00:32:55,792
- So what are you doing?

1018
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:56,625
- [Randy] What am I doing?

1019
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:59,959
I'm more so stuck
Photoshopping which I--

1020
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:02,125
- No, no, no, no, no.

1021
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,375
On your two hours a
day of trying to sell,

1022
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:06,291
what are you actually doing?

1023
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:10,917
- [Randy] I'm
sitting on the computer.

1024
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:12,750
I mean, what do you...

1025
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,208
- No, I'm asking
you in detail, brother.

1026
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:17,166
- [Randy] What's my
day to day look like?

1027
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:18,000
- No!

1028
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,291
One more time, you told me
that you spend two hours a day

1029
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,792
trying to sell and
get clients, correct?

1030
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,041
- [Randy] Oh, what do
I do during the selling.

1031
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:28,417
I go to the
clients that I already have

1032
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:31,667
and I ask them to, you
know, their hair salons,

1033
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:34,458
again, the yoga studio,
see if they have clients

1034
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:37,959
that'll fit my
profile versus cold calling.

1035
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:42,583
- Yeah, so I think that you
are not a natural salesperson.

1036
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:43,417
I think that you need to get

1037
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:46,917
very comfortable around
cold calling, cold DM'ing,

1038
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:49,000
emailing websites
that are local,

1039
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,291
and driving for an
hour up and down main street

1040
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:52,500
and knocking on doors

1041
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,291
because that's
your issue right now.

1042
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:56,166
You need to grab business.

1043
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:57,750
It's not gonna come to you.

1044
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,375
The end.

1045
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:00,458
- [Randy] Alright, thanks.

1046
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:01,583
- You're welcome, my man.

1047
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:02,959
Good!

1048
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:06,000
- And that's tough
'cause he's a starving artist

1049
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,083
and there's
millions of them out there.

1050
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,417
- One more, let's
get one more call.

1051
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:11,250
- It's tough.

1052
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,083
You've got to build your brand,

1053
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,125
you've gotta build
the value proposition,

1054
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:15,208
and you have to hustle.

1055
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:17,750
- Yeah, I mean
look, it's super hard.

1056
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:21,667
This is being in
the creative business.

1057
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:22,875
He wants to have a business.

1058
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:24,125
The problem with a lot of people

1059
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:25,417
when they want
to have a business

1060
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:27,500
is they don't
want the business part.

1061
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,917
- The hard work.

1062
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:29,958
- They wanna do the,

1063
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:31,917
and by the way, it's hard
work to create the art,

1064
00:34:31,917 --> 00:34:33,917
it's hard work to be handy,

1065
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:35,708
and some people
are great plumbers,

1066
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:36,542
it doesn't mean that they

1067
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:38,291
should have a plumbing
business that they own.

1068
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:39,917
They should go work for somebody

1069
00:34:39,917 --> 00:34:41,750
and be the most
valuable plumber.

1070
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,166
The craft is
separate from the business.

1071
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,333
- [Korrina] Hello?

1072
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,583
- Korrina, it's Gary Vaynerchuk,

1073
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:48,166
and you're on
#AskGaryVee with Erik Wahl.

1074
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,333
- [Korrina] Oh my God!

1075
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:50,708
You have to be
kidding me right now!

1076
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:52,583
- You made it, Korrina!

1077
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:55,291
- [Korrina] Oh my God,
that is awesome!

1078
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:56,792
- What's your question?

1079
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:59,542
- [Korrina] Okay, my
question is if you have

1080
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:01,583
too much passion
to do too many things,

1081
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:04,000
like for instance, like
you have too many things,

1082
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,166
like right now you do so much,

1083
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:08,792
like you just don't
like that you have the--

1084
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:11,708
- Yeah, you've got to many
things that you want to do.

1085
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:12,542
- [Korrina] Exactly, yeah.

1086
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:14,166
- How do you pick one?

1087
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:15,000
- [Korrina] Correct, yes.

1088
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,959
- Pick one!

1089
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:18,041
(group laughter)

1090
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:19,708
- [Korrina] So that's
the only advice?

1091
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:20,542
Okay.

1092
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:22,000
- Erik, what do you have?

1093
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,917
I mean, this is my
most common asked question.

1094
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:26,041
"Gary, I have 11 passions,

1095
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,875
"how do I choose the right one
to build my business around?"

1096
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:31,708
- I've got 11 passions as well.

1097
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:35,750
I pour my time and energy into
the ones that I'm best at,

1098
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,750
and that make money,

1099
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,875
and then I keep the
other ones as side projects

1100
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:41,625
that I will tend to as hobbies

1101
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:43,875
until I can actually
turn them into something

1102
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,667
either that I'm very good at

1103
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:48,166
or that I can commoditize
and make money at,

1104
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:50,792
and so, yeah.

1105
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:54,000
- Korrina, I think
this is a humongous excuse

1106
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,083
by the majority of people

1107
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:56,959
that they have so
many different things

1108
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:58,667
that they are passionate about,

1109
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:00,333
as an excuse to not actually

1110
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:02,750
put in the 15 hours a
day against something.

1111
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:06,583
I really mean that, and I don't
know if that's your issue,

1112
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:09,041
but I'm saying that because
a lot of people are watching,

1113
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,917
and I wanna get to
this once and for all.

1114
00:36:10,917 --> 00:36:13,875
No joke, flip a fucking coin.

1115
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:17,166
Write all your different
passions on a dartboard

1116
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:19,792
and throw the dart,
like, just pick one.

1117
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:21,000
I love when people are like,

1118
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,166
"Gary, I love
them all so equally."

1119
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:26,208
I go, "Great, then
there should be no concern."

1120
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:29,125
The other things is if you're
trying to decide between two,

1121
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:32,000
when you flip the coin,
a funny thing happens.

1122
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,625
Your heart will tell you,
your brain will tell you

1123
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,250
which one you actually wanna do.

1124
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:39,000
- And Korrina, this is,

1125
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,917
the fact that you have 11 things

1126
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:42,125
that you're super pumped about,

1127
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:43,166
I think that's awesome.

1128
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:45,875
There's a lot of people out
there listening or watching

1129
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,750
that are trying to find what
they're passionate about.

1130
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,667
They don't know,
they're trying to seek money

1131
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:52,417
or financial security.

1132
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:54,250
The fact that you have so
many things to choose from

1133
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,208
is a blessing that
you get to pick one

1134
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:58,583
and not try and find
something in the world.

1135
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,041
I think that's awesome.

1136
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:01,792
- [Korrina] Alright, 
that's awesome.

1137
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:03,500
That was all my questions,
thank you guys for calling me.

1138
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,959
This is like a really cool
experience--

1139
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:07,542
- Korrina, don't
leave yet, I got a question.

1140
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:08,458
- [Korrina] Go ahead, yeah.

1141
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:11,125
- Which passion are
you gonna pick right now?

1142
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:13,250
- [Korrina] My passion, I'm
probably gonna be a trader.

1143
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,959
I wanna do penny stock trading.

1144
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,458
I am also really passionate,

1145
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:19,959
like I have a great
charisma with people,

1146
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:22,375
so I'd actually like to just
get in on modeling right now,

1147
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:24,667
'cause I do that,
so, my main one is--

1148
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:26,041
- Wait a minute, 
we're deciding between modeling

1149
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:27,375
and penny stock trading?

1150
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:28,208
(group laughter)

1151
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:29,250
This is amazing! Do both!

1152
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,917
(group laughter)

1153
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:32,333
- Korrina, if there's
anything that I can do

1154
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,208
to talk you out of penny
stock or day trading--

1155
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:37,708
- How can she find oyu?

1156
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:39,083
- She can't find...

1157
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:39,917
How can she find me?

1158
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:41,875
- Yeah, like email you where
or hit you up on Twitter where?

1159
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:44,417
If you're gonna agree
to help her, let's do it.

1160
00:37:44,417 --> 00:37:48,583
- Korrina, hit me up on
Instagram or Twitter @erikwahl

1161
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:51,625
and send me a note
and I'll respond to you,

1162
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:53,458
but I would--

1163
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:55,458
- Korrina, great news, he's
gonna turn you into a model.

1164
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:56,834
He's gonna talk
you outta penny stock!

1165
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:58,375
- There you go, there you go.

1166
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:00,834
Future modeling
career, congratulations!

1167
00:38:00,834 --> 00:38:02,333
- What's that?

1168
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,208
- [Andy] That
question really remind me

1169
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:06,750
of your Jason Calacanis rant.

1170
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,583
- Yeah, I agree.

1171
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:10,750
Alright, so this is like the
big moment of the episode.

1172
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,792
So this is insane.

1173
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:17,375
That's right, thank you.

1174
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:20,625
I'm giving this away
because this is so sick.

1175
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:22,083
And just like, I just...

1176
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:24,917
To be very frank, I
kinda want it for myself,

1177
00:38:24,917 --> 00:38:26,041
but here's why I
wanna give it away:

1178
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:29,291
I'm so convinced
in your value prop

1179
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:31,166
and my belief of like

1180
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:33,208
what this is gonna
be worth to one of,

1181
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:35,041
so you've gotta
come and pick it up.

1182
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:35,875
This is the weird thing.

1183
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:38,583
So, like, I'm not
shipping it, I decided,

1184
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,125
and so if you live in
Seattle and you win this,

1185
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:43,000
come and visit me.
I'll high five you.

1186
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,500
We're gonna pick one person
from the comments randomly,

1187
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,667
but you have gotta answer
Erik's question of the day.

1188
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:50,792
As a guest, you get to
ask the question of the day,

1189
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:51,959
could be any question,

1190
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:53,291
and one of you randomly,

1191
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:55,291
in Facebook, or
Instagram, or YouTube,

1192
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,041
one of those three
places, will win this...

1193
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:59,250
How long did
this take you to make?

1194
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,625
- That took me
a couple of hours,

1195
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:02,375
but that's just a
box that I shipped.

1196
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:04,917
And before we get to
far, I just wanna explain

1197
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:07,417
that number one, I don't
sell any of my art anywhere,

1198
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:10,083
so you can't buy it anywhere,

1199
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:12,917
but I'm also into
value proposition,

1200
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:16,708
so whoever calls in,
or whatever India sets up

1201
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:17,542
is gonna get this,

1202
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:20,125
but I also wanted to

1203
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:23,291
throw this into that box.

1204
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:24,583
So this is...

1205
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:27,542
I was talking about the thinker.

1206
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:31,792
This is the clouds and dirt,
this is the hard work,

1207
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:34,625
this is the heavy
lifting and the thinking,

1208
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:36,125
so not either or, it's yes and.

1209
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:37,125
It's the spark and the grind,

1210
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:40,083
so that goes inside that box.

1211
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:42,291
- Okay, so
actually, should I ship it?

1212
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:43,125
I should probably ship it.

1213
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:44,792
We're gonna ship it.

1214
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,625
So what is the
question of the day, my friend?

1215
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:50,208
- Okay, so what I do is I,

1216
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:51,708
since I don't
sell any of my artwork,

1217
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,667
I hide it all over the world.

1218
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:55,041
I hide pieces of
artwork like this

1219
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:57,750
and then I tweet it
out in what are called

1220
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,250
art drop treasure hunts,

1221
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,875
and the first person
to find it on social media

1222
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:01,959
gets to keep it,

1223
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:04,375
and so with something
like this, I wanna know

1224
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:05,333
from whatever city you're at,

1225
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:09,000
what city would you like me to
hide a piece of artwork from?

1226
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,875
Whatever gets the most response

1227
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,917
is where I'll be aiming
to hide the next piece of art

1228
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:14,792
for art drop.

1229
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:16,750
- Erik, also, I
wanna wrap up with this.

1230
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,208
Tell everybody
where they can find you.

1231
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,583
Obviously, you
mentioned your Instagram,

1232
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,917
but video blog, the
books, like what's...

1233
00:40:21,917 --> 00:40:24,792
- My website,
theartofvision.com.

1234
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:25,625
Let's link that up.

1235
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:26,291
(bell rings)

1236
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:28,291
- Yeah, all of
my social's on there.

1237
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:30,792
Because of you, I have
become fluent in Snapchat

1238
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:32,625
the last year,
Instagram stories,

1239
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:34,708
so I'm kind of
new to social media,

1240
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:38,291
but I'm building
my plane as I fly it.

1241
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:40,417
Learning the game
like everyone else.

1242
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:41,708
- I love you, buddy.
- Thank you, pal.

1243
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,125
- It's really good
to have you on the show.

1244
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:43,792
- Pleasure being here.

1245
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:46,750
- You keep asking questions,
we'll keep answering them.

1246
00:40:46,750 --> 00:00:00,000
