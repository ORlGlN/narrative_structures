00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem of culturing all this</font>

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,380
is psychology right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> born</font>

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,899
the Soviet Union right and so like for

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,150
as much as China loves to talk about

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,099
it's capitalism there's plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,170
communist tendencies still in that

7
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">country there I'm an investor in a</font>

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,980
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> that control and then</font>

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,380
somebody wired into the government who

10
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,600
was competing with that app decided that

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,310
was a bad thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just disappeared</font>

12
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,380
right that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really happen as much</font>

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. right and so I think that</font>

14
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,810
culturally we have to understand a lot

15
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,759
of differences for example nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

16
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,829
America cares about privacy let's start

17
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">with that we think we do but our</font>

18
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,410
behavior shows we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the only</font>

19
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,020
do things Americans really care about is

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,879
the health of their family and money and

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,070
both of those things have been solved

22
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,950
with a more open world not<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition for</font>

23
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,719
example how many being here on that

24
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,430
credit<font color="#E5E5E5"> card fraud in their lives our</font>

25
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,699
strategy right quite a few if every one

26
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,680
of these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't get their money</font>

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,180
back they would give a<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

28
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,949
privacy but they all<font color="#CCCCCC"> have their money</font>

29
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,080
that right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then when you look at</font>

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,510
kidnapping<font color="#E5E5E5"> or crime because of all media</font>

31
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,150
companies now right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can record</font>

32
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,760
kidnapping is actually collapsing it

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,409
across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> country because it's hard to</font>

34
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:14,909
kidnap a kid in the ball at four

35
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">o'clock is between nine hundred pictures</font>

36
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,479
right so however so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is important as</font>

37
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,000
so what that does is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it allows us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,430
America to share to put out more stuff

39
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,110
if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the behavior in other</font>

40
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,180
places those countries in the Middle

41
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,220
East where people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are very scared to</font>

42
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,079
share something and even in China the

43
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,350
shareability has

44
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,360
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so culturally there's</font>

45
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,710
so many variables<font color="#CCCCCC"> we work with a lot of</font>

46
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,990
global brands we spend a lot of time

47
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,259
understanding the slang the nuances you

48
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:46,090
know pop culture the US on Sundays

football pop culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the other</font>

50
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,170
sundays cricket there's all these

51
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,080
variables<font color="#E5E5E5"> I basically call it down to</font>

52
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">like slide right it's just knowing the</font>

00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,759
nuances you have the North Star when

you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of achieve but if</font>

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are unable to translate and</font>

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,020
culturally you lose so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

same picture doesn't do as well on

facebook as it doesn't pinterest as does

an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Instagram as it does on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

62
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,900
there's very different context to the

63
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,120
person while they're looking a 27 year

64
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,069
old woman on pinterest looking at a

65
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:23,470
picture she's window shopping or the

66
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,019
intent or aspiration to buy what she's

67
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:27,970
going through stream on facebook she's

68
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,160
keeping up with her world you would the

69
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,470
message totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> different if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

70
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,630
sell based on what platform she's on

71
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,000
based on if she's on mobile versus if

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,920
she's on desktop so we're grossly

73
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,530
underestimated all these contacts points

74
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,850
we just think you know everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> says</font>

75
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,970
content is king that's ludicrous content

76
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,519
through the proper<font color="#E5E5E5"> context filter is</font>

77
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,760
king and that context filter is takes a

78
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,370
lot of data and understanding like how

79
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">many for example I know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> picture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

80
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:58,870
Instagram<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a primary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> color</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> red in</font>

81
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,820
the bottom left corner has a better

82
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,160
chance of succeeding than not right but

83
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that takes a lot of testing and being in</font>

84
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,910
at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason I know that is</font>

85
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,130
because we manage 150 accounts and we

86
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,560
have scale of metrics and all we ever do

87
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,150
knowing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook has all the data</font>

88
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,440
is we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

89
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,840
creative data right how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many how many</font>

90
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,390
words in a post how many hashtags on

91
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,299
Instagram all these different variables

92
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:23,050
and it becomes

93
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,190
pretty endless when you go to

94
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">geo-targeting I mean America segmented</font>

95
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,650
if you use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> word pop you know when</font>

96
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,390
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> close in South Carolina it will do</font>

97
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,460
better that if you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same work</font>

98
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,470
soda in New York it will do matter and

99
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,930
so you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the heavy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so nautical</font>

100
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">slang marketing it's very intense when</font>

101
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,780
you go China America America France

102
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,090
because the cultures are fundamentally

103
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,390
different things messaging resonates

104
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,640
very differently you know us is very

105
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,860
conservative when it comes to sex I can

106
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,420
tell me French posts that are risking

107
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,760
crushed right and so it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

108
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,860
stereotypes that we've all heard they

109
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,250
work but yeah blanket just taking

110
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,600
something and posting it even if you

111
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,520
completely translator word-for-word

112
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,170
never works because you took out the

113
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,120
contact all you do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> translate the</font>

114
00:04:10,120 --> 00:00:00,000
content
