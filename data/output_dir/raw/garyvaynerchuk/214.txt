1
00:00:00,344 --> 00:00:01,552
- It's 12 minutes, right?

2
00:00:01,552 --> 00:00:02,892
(woman speaking afar)

3
00:00:02,892 --> 00:00:04,147
Is every talk 12 minutes?

4
00:00:04,147 --> 00:00:05,094
- I don't know.

5
00:00:05,094 --> 00:00:07,103
- Joe Nameth, you are number 12.

6
00:00:07,103 --> 00:00:10,102
For all you jet home fans at home.

7
00:00:10,102 --> 00:00:13,185
(calm hip-hop music)

8
00:00:18,173 --> 00:00:20,308
- Instagram, wanna jump on real quick.

9
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:23,458
Tomorrow, in Los Angeles, 7 to 9PM,

10
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,618
Shoe Palace, doing a
little meet-and-greet,

11
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:27,703
teaming up for my sneaker
that's coming out,

12
00:00:27,703 --> 00:00:30,070
my collaboration sneaker
that's coming out in November

13
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,675
with K-Swiss.

14
00:00:31,675 --> 00:00:34,707
So, I am teaming up with them to launch it

15
00:00:34,707 --> 00:00:36,239
at Shoe Palance tomorrow.

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,603
Are we switching?

17
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:38,436
- I mean, you don't have to, but

18
00:00:38,436 --> 00:00:39,269
- But I like-

19
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:40,102
- You should for tomorrow.

20
00:00:40,102 --> 00:00:41,473
- I mean, they're so cool.

21
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:43,643
- This is kind of my
favorite pair that they have.

22
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:46,226
Okay, good flight this morning.

23
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,921
How are you, brother? Good to see you.

24
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:51,082
You well? I've got a couple of bents.

25
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:51,915
I'm fireside chatting Will.i.Am.

26
00:00:51,915 --> 00:00:53,248
- [Woman] Yes.

27
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,561
- Will?

28
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:56,089
- Oh, shit, what up, GV?

29
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,985
- I'm very excited to
be fireside chatting you

30
00:00:57,985 --> 00:00:58,990
in a second.

31
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,823
- Oh, yeah, that thing's gonna be,

32
00:00:59,823 --> 00:01:01,095
(Gary laughs)
hey, don't,

33
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,107
don't beat me up, bro.

34
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:02,960
- I won't.

35
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,232
- Now, as my 12 minutes.

36
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:05,862
I've got 12 minutes.

37
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:07,297
- [Woman] Will.i.Am is also on, though.

38
00:01:07,297 --> 00:01:09,553
- I'm gonna talk about-

39
00:01:09,553 --> 00:01:11,448
I'm gonna be the Uber of pillows.

40
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:12,920
Great, fuckface.

41
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,788
Everybody's trying to
communicate something

42
00:01:14,788 --> 00:01:17,809
and it's awfully hard to
penetrate if you think

43
00:01:17,809 --> 00:01:20,325
you're gonna be able to
just talk in an environment

44
00:01:20,325 --> 00:01:22,222
where the supply and demand of talking has

45
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:24,055
fundamentally shifted.

46
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,346
These are always kind
of the most interesting

47
00:01:26,346 --> 00:01:30,456
moments, 4 or 5 minutes
before, 7 minutes before

48
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:31,743
the keynote.

49
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:33,939
I get into that weird zone.

50
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:37,048
Where I just wanna destroy the audience.

51
00:01:37,048 --> 00:01:38,780
It's the weirdest thing,
I really get competitive

52
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,826
with the audience itself.

53
00:01:39,826 --> 00:01:42,544
I wanna give it so much
value, that I turn it

54
00:01:42,544 --> 00:01:44,451
into my competitor.

55
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:46,305
It's such an interesting insight.

56
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:48,562
Anyway, pretty interesting crowd.

57
00:01:48,562 --> 00:01:50,798
A lot of leaders from a
lot of different sectors

58
00:01:50,798 --> 00:01:55,360
here, at Worlds, so, 12
minutes is super short.

59
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,792
Sometimes it takes me
12 minutes to warm up,

60
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:57,805
as you know, D-Roc.

61
00:01:57,805 --> 00:01:59,240
Youtube, you guys know.

62
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,940
As you guys know, usually
you guys all skip the first

63
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,948
12 minutes of a keynote, right?

64
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:07,199
'Cause it's the backstory,
so I gotta get right into it.

65
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:10,062
I'm ironically not a
zero-to-sixty speaker on stage.

66
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:13,410
I am in rants, I can go
right there, so this will

67
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,861
be a good challenge.

68
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:17,363
I'm excited about it though.

69
00:02:17,363 --> 00:02:20,484
Lot of friends in the audience,
a lot of acquaintances.

70
00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:22,516
So, should be an interesting talk.

71
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:23,410
See what happens.

72
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,244
One other thing that has
been really on my mind

73
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:27,767
when it comes to entrepreneurship
and the ones that

74
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:29,638
are winning and the ones that are losing,

75
00:02:29,638 --> 00:02:31,780
and the word is "gratitude."

76
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,447
I am stunned by people's
ability to complain

77
00:02:36,727 --> 00:02:37,958
about dumb shit.

78
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,002
(audience laughs)
(Gary laughs)

79
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:42,876
I wish every one of you, if I could wish

80
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:46,112
any fictional thing on
you right now, I wish

81
00:02:46,112 --> 00:02:48,849
that your great-great-great-
grandparents would

82
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:51,542
come up, be alive, look
you dead in the face, and

83
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:54,061
say, "You're a fucking asshole."

84
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:57,054
(audience laughs)

85
00:02:57,054 --> 00:03:00,278
But the fact, I mean,
at the most micro-level,

86
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:01,486
'cause I'm actually going macro here, but

87
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:03,707
at the most micro level
of entrepreneurship,

88
00:03:03,707 --> 00:03:06,667
there was never a day and
age where you were under 30,

89
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:08,646
getting 4-million-dollar
valuations and funding

90
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,906
on your idea, respected
in society so much because

91
00:03:11,906 --> 00:03:14,185
the technology shift,
all of the sudden, 50,

92
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:16,705
60, 70-year-olds respect
your point of view,

93
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:19,011
and yet, we find things to
complain about, even though

94
00:03:19,011 --> 00:03:21,975
this is the single,
disproportionate, greatest

95
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:24,472
era ever to be under
30 to build a business.

96
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:25,601
And it's not even close.

97
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:29,035
And so we complain about
things like Facebook and

98
00:03:29,035 --> 00:03:32,010
Instagram changed their algorithm.

99
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,976
Like, let me just save
everybody a little time,

100
00:03:35,976 --> 00:03:37,669
if you meet somebody
who's complaining that

101
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:39,522
their business is in
trouble because Facebook

102
00:03:39,522 --> 00:03:41,404
and Instagram changed
their algorithm, that

103
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:42,992
person fucking lost.

104
00:03:42,992 --> 00:03:44,398
(audience laughs)

105
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:45,287
They're done.

106
00:03:45,287 --> 00:03:48,383
The one thing I've lost
that I'm now reconnected

107
00:03:48,383 --> 00:03:50,556
with over the last 12
months, that I implore

108
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:53,694
everybody here gets really
connected with is that

109
00:03:53,694 --> 00:03:56,156
entrepreneurship changes
every day, the market

110
00:03:56,156 --> 00:03:59,360
changes every day,
things happen every day.

111
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,571
Entrepreneurship sucks.

112
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:04,028
I know it's cool, but let
me tell you, entrepreneuship

113
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:05,382
is lonely as shit.

114
00:04:05,382 --> 00:04:07,784
One thing we don't talk
about in this group,

115
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:09,517
us friends, we like to talk
about all the good shit,

116
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:12,414
we're not talking about
the depression, and suicide

117
00:04:12,414 --> 00:04:13,948
that so many of our
friends are going through

118
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:15,734
because it's the first
time they've actually

119
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:18,469
lost because school is a rigged game.

120
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:21,535
Entrepreneurship is, you're
playing against the market.

121
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:22,890
And the market doesn't give a fuck what

122
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,208
your grandfather did.

123
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,458
And so, we need to really,
really start understanding

124
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:30,445
that the number 1 trait of a number 1 is

125
00:04:30,445 --> 00:04:33,253
the ability to get punched in the mouth,

126
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:36,023
the face, the stomach,
over and over and over and

127
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:37,673
over again.

128
00:04:37,673 --> 00:04:40,109
I eat shit for a living.

129
00:04:40,109 --> 00:04:44,192
(audience laughter and applause)

130
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:49,447
And your ability, in
this room, if you aspire

131
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:52,043
or continue to be an
entrepreneur, your ability to

132
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:55,859
eat shit is the quickest
indicator of where you end up.

133
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:59,074
Because it moves, it changes,
and we're treating it like

134
00:04:59,074 --> 00:05:02,230
this awesome lifestyle
thing, putting bullshit

135
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,762
fucking photos on Instagram
like it's so fucking rad.

136
00:05:05,762 --> 00:05:09,407
My friends, entrepreneurship
is not Coachella.

137
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:12,240
(audience laughs)

138
00:05:13,775 --> 00:05:14,886
They're like, "Oh, it'll be no problem."

139
00:05:14,886 --> 00:05:16,858
- [Man] So many luxury venues-

140
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:17,691
- How you doing?

141
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:18,524
- Hey, really good.

142
00:05:18,524 --> 00:05:19,357
How are you?

143
00:05:19,357 --> 00:05:20,190
- Good.
- Tim?

144
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,023
- Yeah.
- Welcome.

145
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,856
- [Interviewer] Alrighty, so,

146
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:22,689
what's your favorite thing about this

147
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,356
summit about worlds?

148
00:05:25,445 --> 00:05:26,278
- The people.

149
00:05:26,278 --> 00:05:28,841
You know, I think there's
so many friends and

150
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:32,177
acquaintances that come
to this event, that

151
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:34,102
are in my social graph
that I don't get to spend

152
00:05:34,102 --> 00:05:36,795
time with because
everybody's kind of busy.

153
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,077
The people that I deem friend
and sell as acquaintances

154
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:40,937
are the ones that I
barely seek 'cause they're

155
00:05:40,937 --> 00:05:42,637
hustling as well.

156
00:05:42,637 --> 00:05:44,270
So, just being able to
run into that, and then,

157
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,841
the other 100 people, 30
people, 17 people that

158
00:05:47,841 --> 00:05:51,952
I get to run into, introduce
myself, get to know them.

159
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,815
So I think of it as like
the depth and the width of

160
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:58,065
worlds that a lot of events
don't provide for me, so

161
00:05:58,065 --> 00:06:00,702
you know, depth being that
4th or 5th time I get to

162
00:06:00,702 --> 00:06:03,158
have a conversation with
somebody that's in my circle,

163
00:06:03,158 --> 00:06:05,931
but with that, you know,
so many times, and it's

164
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:07,751
already happened, I've
been here just a few hours,

165
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:11,207
and last time, gaining
context with that first

166
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:14,530
introduction, to new people
that I'll know forever,

167
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,947
I like that.

168
00:06:15,947 --> 00:06:17,632
- You say, change your
friend group, that's

169
00:06:17,632 --> 00:06:19,437
one of the most important
things you can do.

170
00:06:19,437 --> 00:06:20,921
How do you get started on that?

171
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:22,581
Especially living in a place like LA.

172
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:23,965
(Gary laughs)
You know?

173
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:27,950
How do you, interact with, how do you,

174
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,898
what's the first step to-

175
00:06:28,898 --> 00:06:29,983
- It's one of the first times I've ever

176
00:06:29,983 --> 00:06:32,282
talked about it on stage
today, so I'm still

177
00:06:32,282 --> 00:06:33,869
kind of developing this
thought, but I've been

178
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:37,013
giving a lot of thought
to how fortunate I am.

179
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:38,456
I think a lot of people
talk about luck and,

180
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:40,771
when you're somebody
like me, you work a lot

181
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:42,895
and things of that nature,
it's hard to accept luck,

182
00:06:42,895 --> 00:06:45,593
but there's no question,
things like being able to

183
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:47,396
immigrate out of the
Soviet Union or having a

184
00:06:47,396 --> 00:06:50,542
mother that is so insanely
amazing, you know,

185
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:52,909
I didn't control that, that
was given to me, and so

186
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:55,032
one of the things I've been
thinking a lot about is,

187
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:57,223
well, what happens when
you're 25, you hear one of my

188
00:06:57,223 --> 00:06:58,848
clips, you're somebody
else, and you're like,

189
00:06:58,848 --> 00:06:59,681
"Wait, that's true."

190
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:02,197
Like, my mom stinks, or
like, my family environment

191
00:07:02,197 --> 00:07:04,878
was bad, or maybe I was,
let me go another way,

192
00:07:04,878 --> 00:07:08,198
maybe I was so priviledged,
that I don't have hunger.

193
00:07:08,198 --> 00:07:10,749
If you now are self-aware,
deploying new thoughts,

194
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:13,717
and you understand some truths,
what can do you about it?

195
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:16,072
The only thing that I believe in is you

196
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:17,309
can't fake environment.

197
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:18,237
- Right.

198
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,329
- You can't fake environment.

199
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:23,112
So, if you gather yourself
with people who are

200
00:07:23,112 --> 00:07:26,082
from a certain cloth, or
have a certain hunger,

201
00:07:26,082 --> 00:07:28,167
or have a certain point
of view, very quickly

202
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:30,448
that rubs off on you, and I
think what people struggle

203
00:07:30,448 --> 00:07:33,107
with is, when they want to
evolve, they want to stay

204
00:07:33,107 --> 00:07:35,540
tried and true to their
friends, and that's a

205
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,773
very difficult bridge,
of selling out, in both

206
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:39,644
directions.

207
00:07:39,644 --> 00:07:41,781
I think the cliche one, is
you come from not that much,

208
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:43,699
you wanna move up, that's
the one that most people

209
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,871
think when they hear this,
but I'll tell you that

210
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:48,852
I'm probably giving more
advice to kids that grew up

211
00:07:48,852 --> 00:07:52,385
with privilege, to go and
live in reality because

212
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:54,995
that's the only way they
can offset, and that's super

213
00:07:54,995 --> 00:07:56,141
hard too.

214
00:07:56,141 --> 00:08:00,954
Because breaking your patterns
if extremely difficult,

215
00:08:00,954 --> 00:08:04,099
but if you're unhappy with
your situation, you've gotta

216
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:05,614
change your pattern.

217
00:08:05,614 --> 00:08:07,459
Much like a diet, like
if you're not happy with

218
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:09,962
where you're at, you've
got to change your patterns

219
00:08:09,962 --> 00:08:12,032
in a hardcore way.

220
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:14,171
I just believe in that in
life, and that is just not

221
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:16,605
a conversation that people
are having, it's not

222
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:19,938
a very politically correct conversation.

223
00:08:20,777 --> 00:08:22,791
I think I'll be historically
correct, so I'm willing

224
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,071
to take the short-term push-back for the

225
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,718
long-term success.

226
00:08:26,718 --> 00:08:29,301
(upbeat music)

227
00:08:35,256 --> 00:08:36,863
You change your livelihood-
when people make

228
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:38,642
a mistake, 'cause they make
$280 being a salesperson,

229
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:41,634
they wanna start a candle
company, but then they

230
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:43,904
buy a house and have all this overhead-

231
00:08:43,904 --> 00:08:44,737
- Right.

232
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:46,198
- And they fucking feed
their own thing and they

233
00:08:46,198 --> 00:08:47,031
never go make the candle.

234
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:47,864
(Gary speaks over man.)

235
00:08:47,864 --> 00:08:49,922
If you know you wanna do something else,

236
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:52,253
and you're good at this,
save your fucking money,

237
00:08:52,253 --> 00:08:54,457
and then when you jump into the pool, go

238
00:08:54,457 --> 00:08:56,848
fucking rent a shithole and give yourself

239
00:08:56,848 --> 00:08:59,228
that two years to see if you can do it.

240
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:00,676
And then you live with no regret.

241
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:01,750
'Cause you can always go back.

242
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,066
- [Man] 'Cause you never wanna
wake up saying, "What if?"

243
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:04,684
- 'Cause you can always
go back to the thing that

244
00:09:04,684 --> 00:09:06,615
you're good at, that makes you money, that

245
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:07,453
you don't love.

246
00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:08,819
You can always go back to that.

247
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:10,449
There's always people
looking for salespeople.

248
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:11,282
- Absolutely.

249
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:12,115
- Got it?

250
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:13,526
Super productive day,
we'll be a nice, little

251
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:14,868
clean edit for you, D-Roc.

252
00:09:14,868 --> 00:09:15,990
Nice, tight day.

253
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,740
Gotta work out now, gotta sneak those in,

254
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,652
take care of your body.

255
00:09:19,652 --> 00:09:22,083
Just always a good strategy.

256
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,535
And a couple meetings for tonight, reload

257
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:26,880
for tomorrow, just got
done with an incredible,

258
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,112
I don't know if you filmed it, D-Roc,

259
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:29,653
probably did, that's how
you roll, but I saw you

260
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:30,759
bullshitting with Tyler,
so maybe you didn't,

261
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:32,763
but if you did, just got
done with an incredible

262
00:09:32,763 --> 00:09:33,786
recruitment call.

263
00:09:33,786 --> 00:09:36,407
We're super fucking passionate about you.

264
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:40,394
I, listen, to be very frank, I've already

265
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:41,795
won because of this phone call.

266
00:09:41,795 --> 00:09:42,628
Right?

267
00:09:42,628 --> 00:09:46,710
Either, you go with
us, and we dominate, or

268
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,533
I get to make fun of
you at the pro-bowl in

269
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:50,433
9 years not coming with us.

270
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:52,025
This being a sports thing is so funny,

271
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,942
it's amazing how passionate I am to

272
00:09:56,726 --> 00:10:00,189
these kids are making
such funny decisions,

273
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:03,459
it's like us, and not
us, it's like, you know,

274
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:06,360
in the agency world, in
the wine world, like,

275
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,876
us versus the rest was
close enough that it

276
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:10,404
didn't feel devastating.

277
00:10:10,404 --> 00:10:13,231
These kids are, God, I
really hope they go with us.

278
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:16,870
Anyway, nonetheless, good
day, and I hope everybody's,

279
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,273
we're in the dog days of summer.

280
00:10:19,273 --> 00:10:22,358
This is when the separation
in the marketplace happens.

281
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:23,699
You drinkin' rose?

282
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:25,677
On the beach?
(man laughs)

283
00:10:25,677 --> 00:10:26,844
Or aren't you?

284
00:10:28,363 --> 00:10:29,304
Cool.

285
00:10:29,304 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
