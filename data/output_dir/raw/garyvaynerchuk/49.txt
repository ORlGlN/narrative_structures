1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,450
- Dragon fruit.

2
00:00:04,574 --> 00:00:07,741
(inspirational music)

3
00:00:12,737 --> 00:00:15,404
(calming music)

4
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:30,507
PureWow mafia, Mary Kay and Ryan.

5
00:00:30,507 --> 00:00:32,648
Anyway, nonetheless, Babin and I

6
00:00:32,648 --> 00:00:33,880
have done a bad job this morning.

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,920
So what'd I do, I worked
out, I had a meeting

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,772
with Matt Higgins, with
the Steven Ross crew there,

9
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,853
my business partner, I went
and met a new potential client,

10
00:00:41,853 --> 00:00:44,329
I did a couple phone calls,

11
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:48,832
we announced Michael Badgley,
our signed kicker from

12
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:49,885
the University of Miami,

13
00:00:49,885 --> 00:00:51,089
it's all about the U.

14
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:53,824
And now I'm here with PureWow
to make things happen.

15
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:54,660
- Is it three?

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,750
How much money?

17
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,894
'Cause I don't wanna --

18
00:00:56,894 --> 00:01:00,289
- We're still figuring it out ourselves.

19
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:01,122
- Got it.

20
00:01:01,122 --> 00:01:03,281
- And the truth is, it
doesn't work that way.

21
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:04,876
One video can change everything.

22
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:05,859
Do you understand --

23
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:07,343
- You can't contest it against something.

24
00:01:07,343 --> 00:01:10,091
So you're betting on the one --

25
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:13,641
- My man, you're making
television commercials,

26
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:16,348
the only difference is,
there's more attention,

27
00:01:16,348 --> 00:01:18,481
and you get more at bat's.

28
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:19,577
There's three things that are happening.

29
00:01:19,577 --> 00:01:20,966
You're getting more at bat's,

30
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:22,343
you're getting three instead of one,

31
00:01:22,343 --> 00:01:24,012
a lot more people are seeing it

32
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:25,562
so it can penetrate culture,

33
00:01:25,562 --> 00:01:29,062
and the client is paying a lot less for it

34
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:31,686
than they would have in the alternative.

35
00:01:31,686 --> 00:01:32,991
That's why it's right.

36
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:35,307
It doesn't go beyond that, got it?

37
00:01:35,307 --> 00:01:36,730
You wanna hear something amazing?

38
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,381
We only have ancillary beat the hero.

39
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:42,329
We do a vlog, it never gets
seen as much as the one minute

40
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:43,886
clips we get out of the vlog.

41
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:44,957
- That makes total sense.

42
00:01:44,957 --> 00:01:46,864
- Only ancillary beats.

43
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:48,869
Now, this is very long form.

44
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:49,702
- Yup.

45
00:01:49,702 --> 00:01:50,887
- Three minute videos are actually,

46
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:55,083
actually, I retake my thing
'cause if I was to make

47
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,392
a three minute rant right now,

48
00:01:56,392 --> 00:01:57,620
it would beat out the ancillary.

49
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,453
- Yup.

50
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,265
- Like I made the greatest video ever that

51
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:02,879
would have gotten a hundred
fifty million views,

52
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,489
but Babin didn't have audio
in the Milwaukee airport.

53
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:07,322
- [Man] Are you serious?

54
00:02:07,322 --> 00:02:08,787
- That's right vlog, the greatest video --

55
00:02:08,787 --> 00:02:10,139
- It was Australia.

56
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,078
- It was Australia.

57
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:13,198
The greatest video I ever
made that would have been my

58
00:02:13,198 --> 00:02:16,957
true 200 million viewed video on Facebook,

59
00:02:16,957 --> 00:02:18,290
Babin fucked up.

60
00:02:19,977 --> 00:02:21,371
- Oh guys, want your pen?

61
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:22,204
- Yeah.

62
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:27,795
- Yeah, I got it.

63
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:30,538
- If you could tell Dana that
we're gonna meet late tonight

64
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:33,418
about cocktails, that'd be great.

65
00:02:33,418 --> 00:02:35,434
- About cocktails --

66
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:36,544
do we have--

67
00:02:36,544 --> 00:02:37,388
- How are you doin'?

68
00:02:37,388 --> 00:02:38,221
- How are you doin'?

69
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:39,054
Thank you, I didn't
want to just jump in --

70
00:02:39,054 --> 00:02:39,887
- No worries. What's your name?

71
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:40,720
- It's Regina.

72
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,553
- Regina, nice to meet you.

73
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:42,386
- Nice to meet you.

74
00:02:42,386 --> 00:02:44,373
- Have a great day.

75
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:48,658
Oh my god, I have such
a tagline for our brand.

76
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:50,283
Hi low. Fuck the middle.

77
00:02:50,283 --> 00:02:52,252
(laughs)

78
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:54,085
But that's what it is.

79
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:56,065
The middle --

80
00:02:56,065 --> 00:02:57,055
- Fuck in a tagline.

81
00:02:57,055 --> 00:02:58,613
- But that's like what my belief is.

82
00:02:58,613 --> 00:02:59,572
- [Man] It's really good.

83
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:01,655
(laughs)

84
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:05,120
- That's what it is though,

85
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,433
the middle is where everybody's losing.

86
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:10,516
Like that's where everybody's losing.

87
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,315
Yo, whaddup Team Gray V account.

88
00:03:15,315 --> 00:03:16,648
It's me, Gary V.

89
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,553
In Vegas, doin' my thing at CS.

90
00:03:19,553 --> 00:03:20,656
Babin's hustlin'.

91
00:03:20,656 --> 00:03:22,525
It's gonna be back, 2018.

92
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:24,795
I'm gonna fuckin' dismantle 2018.

93
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:26,320
You think we did work in '17?

94
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
Fuckin' '18.

95
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:35,703
What's up man, how are you?

96
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:37,120
Yeah, real quick.

97
00:03:39,644 --> 00:03:41,790
- Gary V. 'Preciate you, dog.

98
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,301
- Take care, brother.

99
00:03:44,301 --> 00:03:47,218
(elevator buzzing)

100
00:03:51,138 --> 00:03:53,934
Just going to a meeting at babbycan film,

101
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,851
that's all we're doin'.

102
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:15,875
- Dude.

103
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:16,880
- Dude, pleasure to meet
you, Shawn Gunn man.

104
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,886
- Hey Shawn, how are you?

105
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:18,720
- Can I take a picture with you?

106
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,553
- 100%.

107
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:20,386
- Aw man.

108
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:21,219
- My man.

109
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,052
- Perfect.

110
00:04:22,052 --> 00:04:22,885
Keep doin' it, keep doin' it.

111
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:23,718
- Take care of yourself, I will. Stay low.

112
00:04:23,718 --> 00:04:25,280
Anyway, how you doin'?

113
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,283
- Good man, good.

114
00:04:26,283 --> 00:04:27,545
I didn't know you were gonna be out here,

115
00:04:27,545 --> 00:04:32,247
I was just here, I was doing
a couple speaking engagements.

116
00:04:32,247 --> 00:04:34,481
I think it was like Homie was like,

117
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:35,314
"Is Gary out there?"

118
00:04:35,314 --> 00:04:36,812
- That's a good question.

119
00:04:36,812 --> 00:04:37,645
- Probably.

120
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:38,478
(laughs)

121
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,619
I mean shit, let's see him
face to face if we're here

122
00:04:39,619 --> 00:04:40,931
and you could spend the
time, I appreciate you--

123
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:42,214
- Yeah, as soon as I
knew you were available,

124
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:43,880
I canceled some stuff.

125
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,657
- "Hey listen, I'm 18 years old,"

126
00:04:45,657 --> 00:04:49,115
he's like, "I'm on this Gary V thing,"

127
00:04:49,115 --> 00:04:50,095
he goes "I'm right there with you,"

128
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:51,722
he goes "when I was 14,"

129
00:04:51,722 --> 00:04:54,067
he goes "I coked with Gary V."

130
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:56,970
And he goes "I've been through
some issues with school"

131
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:57,803
and blah blah blah,

132
00:04:57,803 --> 00:04:59,519
long story short, I gave
him a 20 minute meeting

133
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,101
goes "changed my life."

134
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:05,371
I mean he's now 18 and runs this company,

135
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,669
and he's got, he goes "I've
got this entrepreneur house

136
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:08,843
I'm doing at South by Southwest,

137
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:10,739
I want K-Swiss to be part of it."

138
00:05:10,739 --> 00:05:13,802
He goes, "I'm not gonna charge you."

139
00:05:13,802 --> 00:05:15,368
- Man, that's just so real.

140
00:05:15,368 --> 00:05:16,478
- And he goes, "I just
want you to be involved

141
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:17,944
because 20 of my partners are there,

142
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:19,683
we're all entrepreneurs,"

143
00:05:19,683 --> 00:05:21,628
And he goes, "we're gonna create content."

144
00:05:21,628 --> 00:05:24,183
And I said, "Done, let's go, we're in."

145
00:05:24,183 --> 00:05:25,016
Isn't it amazing?

146
00:05:25,016 --> 00:05:26,700
That was four years ago.

147
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,489
14, this kid's 18 now.

148
00:05:28,489 --> 00:05:29,574
And he's comin' up to me,

149
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:30,929
I mean when I was 18,

150
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:31,817
I wasn't going up to

151
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:34,209
people like that and say "Hey,
give me your business card."

152
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,561
And he's giving me value for free.

153
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:39,156
He said right off the bat like,

154
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:41,031
I'm not gonna charge you because I'm like

155
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:42,155
"Oh right, I'm not interested."

156
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:43,694
- I'm teaching them how to win.

157
00:05:43,694 --> 00:05:46,361
It's so much bigger than
people realize. Okay.

158
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:48,944
(techno music)

159
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:05,532
Hi guys, hi hi hi.

160
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:08,288
Come on in.

161
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:10,203
We go look at culture and the consumer,

162
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:14,370
and we put out a two minute,
14 second cartoon of --

163
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:18,484
'cause that's what the fuck we decided?

164
00:06:18,484 --> 00:06:20,124
I could've sold that to her in that moment

165
00:06:20,124 --> 00:06:24,317
for two thousand off a
separate piece of her budget,

166
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,881
I know it, but I didn't have the tool --

167
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:30,309
I know how I sell, and I know
that there's opportunities,

168
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:33,254
and I wanna have a product to sell.

169
00:06:33,254 --> 00:06:35,004
But like whatever it is,
and it might be one to three

170
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:36,232
products, it might be one product,

171
00:06:36,232 --> 00:06:37,948
it might be a way we talk,

172
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:41,404
but by south by, definitely by can,

173
00:06:41,404 --> 00:06:44,366
the three of us are talkin'
the same language-ish.

174
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:46,623
You know, we alter it
to the moment in time.

175
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:49,429
But the three of us are
talking the same language,

176
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:51,492
and it just becomes habit.

177
00:06:51,492 --> 00:06:53,997
Because I've got the history
and I understand where

178
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,497
I'm taking it, so.

179
00:06:57,085 --> 00:06:59,902
What up vlog, tryin' to use
my phone more this year.

180
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:02,433
We're headin' out, we're here in Vegas.

181
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:04,378
Kickin' Babin out 'cause
I got a MediaLink party

182
00:07:04,378 --> 00:07:07,007
and then after meetings, no
reason to have him hang out.

183
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,945
I'm gonna let him go
have some fuckin' fun.

184
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:12,324
'Cause you know, Babin in
Vegas creates a serious

185
00:07:12,324 --> 00:07:14,416
combination of fuckin' fun.

186
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,011
So while he's goes has fun,

187
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:19,344
I'm gonna go fuckin' create foundational

188
00:07:20,394 --> 00:07:21,561
experiences --

189
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:23,749
I'm just gonna go fuckin' work.

190
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:24,978
It's as simple as that.

191
00:07:24,978 --> 00:00:00,000
(techno music)
