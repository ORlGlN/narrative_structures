1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the New York Jets are gonna</font>

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:12,120
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten and six I think the buffalo bills</font>

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,880
are the most grossly overrated team in

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,379
the NFL everybody's body into the

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,050
hyperbole I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> completely blown away by</font>

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,310
people's belief that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the playoffs and they're gonna win nine</font>

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,449
or ten games it's a five and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11 teen</font>

9
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,510
they stink I feel it in a big way<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,330
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and with that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sunday the</font>

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jets go out and beat the cleveland</font>

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,450
browns 19 to seven I recognize that I

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,820
put myself out there but I believe baby

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">I believe official prediction time guys</font>

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,570
I think the Jets ride the momentum of

16
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,030
last week's win in second half and stun

17
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,559
the Indianapolis Colts the official

18
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,219
score of the game is 2621 New York Jets

19
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:59,789
I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> go eagles 20 Jeff 16 puts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

20
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:01,289
feelings to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go that route but that's uh</font>

21
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,769
that's my official prediction I think

22
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,479
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Jets go into Wembley 1914 thank</font>

23
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,040
me tight I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's made a</font>

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,760
lot of scoring and so I think the Jets

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,610
prevail at a home 2210 jets over the

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">Redskins</font>

27
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,270
I don't hedge I don't hedge but I'm

28
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,730
hedging meaning this is clearly the game

29
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,130
I'm most<font color="#E5E5E5"> confused about unfortunately go</font>

30
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:42,260
2716 Patriots so i just got done taping

31
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,490
another episode where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got to talk</font>

32
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,740
about going 6 for 6 i'm not happy about

33
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,090
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i hate the Patriots with all</font>

34
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,550
my heart and soul and I'm a little bit

35
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,200
worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Raiders game coming up</font>

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,880
this week so 747 is gonna be a challenge

37
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,400
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not quite sure exactly</font>

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,990
what's gonna happen a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

39
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,780
toss-up game but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope you're making</font>

40
00:01:59,780 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">money because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm brilliant</font>
