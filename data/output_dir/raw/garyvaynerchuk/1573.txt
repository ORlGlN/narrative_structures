1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
so I'm sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> here laying here actually</font>

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,580
working watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> the NBA finals and I</font>

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,550
tweeted a little bit ago uh saying that

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,530
Facebook vanity URLs was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a</font>

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,150
game changer and everybody you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a</font>

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,410
lot of people greet actually on Twitter

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,610
but something really why I don't you

8
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,880
know here's why facebook fan pages with

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,150
vanity<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs can do so much more than the</font>

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,189
average Twitter account because you can

11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,900
customize a fan book page you can do a

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,939
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so when you create</font>

13
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,650
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> call to action when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you land</font>

14
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,170
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just following somebody you</font>

15
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,640
can do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of engagement you can do a</font>

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,210
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things and another huge component</font>

17
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,160
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that Facebook vanity URLs</font>

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,290
for the fan page are easy to remember

19
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,210
you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like twitter.com slash</font>

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,059

21
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,920
Twitter's explosion I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt that</font>

22
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook has been about six months slow</font>

23
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,329
to releasing these because once you get

24
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,760
on TV or print or billboards or radio

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,760

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,060
where they're going to become so much

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,860
more important for anybody building

36
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,549
brand or storytelling because of all the

37
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,680
