1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:01,968
- This is a very exciting moment for me.

2
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:04,763
My life is all shit, fires, and issues.

3
00:00:04,763 --> 00:00:08,930
So for Tyler to say this
is a good one, I'm excited.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,817
CEO of (bleep) or (bleep)?

5
00:00:15,962 --> 00:00:16,799
Amazing.

6
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:17,634
(laughing)

7
00:00:17,634 --> 00:00:19,709
We'll be beeping two of the words in there

8
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:21,360
but it went well, it was good.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,027
(hip-hop music)

10
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:30,733
(phone ringing)

11
00:00:32,528 --> 00:00:35,183
So do you wanna focus on
that part of my career,

12
00:00:35,183 --> 00:00:36,709
like why I thought I was able to go from

13
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:38,343
being a wine retailer into kind of

14
00:00:38,343 --> 00:00:41,473
this media thing I've become?

15
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:44,801
When it comes to business
I've always been fearless.

16
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:47,422
I didn't start swimming until I was nine.

17
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:51,615
I was scared of dogs
pretty much my whole life.

18
00:00:51,615 --> 00:00:53,831
I don't like heights all that much.

19
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:56,291
I'm scared of snakes like,
I'm not trying to tackle them,

20
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,064
I have no interest in
hanging around with snakes.

21
00:00:58,064 --> 00:01:00,337
I think everybody's got their
strengths and weaknesses.

22
00:01:00,337 --> 00:01:02,894
When it comes to business,

23
00:01:02,894 --> 00:01:05,734
boy have I been fearless my whole life.

24
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:08,057
Sometimes people wait
until their parents die

25
00:01:08,057 --> 00:01:10,761
so they can run the business, you know?

26
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:12,534
I went a different route.

27
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:15,228
I wanted to give back to my parents,

28
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:17,651
I built the business for them

29
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:21,624
and I then I checked that box
and took my skills elsewhere.

30
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:22,914
I will say this, I think

31
00:01:22,914 --> 00:01:27,130
the surrounding neighborhoods
of Manhattan have a thing.

32
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,919
When you're in the heart of it right,

33
00:01:29,919 --> 00:01:31,733
the heart of the world,
I mean New York City is

34
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:33,958
literally, literally, maybe,

35
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:37,216
arguably the most important
city in the world.

36
00:01:37,216 --> 00:01:39,163
You know when you're within miles of that,

37
00:01:39,163 --> 00:01:42,167
you feel that heartbeat but
you're still not it, right?

38
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:43,928
So you have a little bit of
that chip on your shoulder

39
00:01:43,928 --> 00:01:46,346
and there's a little bit
of that bridge and tunnels,

40
00:01:46,346 --> 00:01:49,164
a little bit of like,
you're the second tier

41
00:01:49,164 --> 00:01:51,425
of the ultimate A tier.

42
00:01:51,425 --> 00:01:53,191
I'll be honest with you, I think that is a

43
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:55,283
disproportionate advantage.

44
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:58,460
I think it's the most
similar thing to actually

45
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,545
being an immigrant in America.

46
00:02:01,545 --> 00:02:04,108
You know, it's having that
little bit of hunger and chip

47
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:06,971
and then if you're lucky
enough to be an immigrant

48
00:02:06,971 --> 00:02:09,533
and grow up in Jersey,
I think it's an edge.

49
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:13,398
I think it's an intensity,
a vibe, a comet,

50
00:02:13,398 --> 00:02:16,981
a level of common sense,
it's an awareness.

51
00:02:18,032 --> 00:02:21,599
Yeah, I think it's a really,
pretty special thing.

52
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,022
Embrace the chip on your shoulder

53
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:28,024
and expand on it and triple down on it

54
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:31,282
and really use it to your advantage.

55
00:02:31,282 --> 00:02:35,135
Awesome, you're welcome,
take care, bye-bye.

56
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:36,254
- I have one more question

57
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:37,528
that I've been wondering.

58
00:02:37,528 --> 00:02:39,693
Who would you say that
besides I guess family members

59
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,886
has been your biggest role model?

60
00:02:41,886 --> 00:02:42,719
- Nobody.

61
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,552
- Nobody?

62
00:02:44,544 --> 00:02:46,249
- That's the truth.

63
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,349
- No one's ever like

64
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:49,567
inspired you to do something?

65
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:53,024
- I'm sure, but I can't figure it out.

66
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:53,857
The real answer--

67
00:02:53,857 --> 00:02:54,975
- 'Cause you're trying to figure it out

68
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,997
or something you've just
kind of, have accepted?

69
00:02:56,997 --> 00:02:58,747
- Like do you know who, you know who,

70
00:02:58,747 --> 00:03:00,567
because they're not,
it's not like I've ever

71
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:02,338
spent any thoughtful time in saying

72
00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:06,184
Richard Branson did this or
I've just never done that.

73
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:09,849
Like kindness and compassion
and empathy and gratitude

74
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:13,561
and good guys and girls inspire me,

75
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:17,982
like oh that's a nice
person, that's a good dude,

76
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:20,815
that gets me going and then the market.

77
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:22,065
Like everybody.

78
00:03:23,011 --> 00:03:24,232
Like the game.

79
00:03:24,232 --> 00:03:27,381
The game, the market, the process.

80
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:30,048
But I've never really, you know?

81
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:33,174
- You seen that video
of Matthew McConaughey,

82
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:35,499
like my role model is like me in 10 years?

83
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:36,726
Like that's kind of--

84
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:38,845
- That's interesting, I
kinda, that's interesting.

85
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:40,519
- You try to be yourself in 10 years

86
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:41,884
and when you get there,
obviously you're not--

87
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:43,135
- That's cool.

88
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:46,122
That's a better articulation probably.

89
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:47,742
- Yeah, that's how I kind of--

90
00:03:47,742 --> 00:03:51,075
- I'm very insular, like really insular.

91
00:03:52,294 --> 00:03:55,710
Like really, like I don't
even know about people.

92
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,543
You know?

93
00:03:57,384 --> 00:03:59,695
Like the thought to
take time to do homework

94
00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:02,763
on somebody that I admire

95
00:04:02,763 --> 00:04:05,634
is like going to outer space.

96
00:04:05,634 --> 00:04:07,668
- You also have to do the
homework, like you said

97
00:04:07,668 --> 00:04:09,085
building relationships,
you have to kind of

98
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:10,551
know the people that you're meeting.

99
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:13,317
- Yeah but I treat, notice
it's a good microcosm

100
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:14,846
back to the (bleep) thing.

101
00:04:14,846 --> 00:04:18,175
You're right but I'm agnostic.

102
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,382
I'm basically talking
to you as hard as I'd be

103
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:23,419
talking to my next meeting
which is Wladimir Klitschko.

104
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:25,822
Which is true, literally
Wladimir Klitschko

105
00:04:25,822 --> 00:04:27,938
is walking in right now
but I'm not gonna try

106
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:30,521
any harder, it's just the same.

107
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:32,694
- I respect that.

108
00:04:32,694 --> 00:04:36,116
- Yeah it ended up being a
great attribute in hindsight.

109
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:38,759
- And you find that people respect that?

110
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,664
Like they don't--

111
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:43,173
- I think people subconsciously feel it.

112
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:46,699
I think big name people
realize I don't give a fuck

113
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:51,647
and I think people on the
coming up appreciate it.

114
00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:53,064
- That makes sense.

115
00:04:53,064 --> 00:04:54,651
It's like they've been treated

116
00:04:54,651 --> 00:04:56,074
like royalty their entire life--

117
00:04:56,074 --> 00:04:57,724
- It's a competitive advantage,

118
00:04:57,724 --> 00:04:59,596
it's a competitive vantage, you know?

119
00:04:59,596 --> 00:05:03,310
The thing for me is
like I just don't care.

120
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,563
I do the right thing at the
right moment every time--

121
00:05:06,563 --> 00:05:09,579
- And if they're not about
it, just on with them?

122
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:10,597
- Yeah 'cause I don't think

123
00:05:10,597 --> 00:05:12,968
anybody's gonna do anything for me.

124
00:05:12,968 --> 00:05:15,218
- Yeah that's true.

125
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:17,979
- I have zero expectations

126
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:21,157
and I can get everything by myself.

127
00:05:21,157 --> 00:05:22,343
- Did you always think that?

128
00:05:22,343 --> 00:05:23,493
- Yeah.

129
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:24,930
- I feel like at the
beginning, it's a lot of like

130
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,935
you do everything for yourself.

131
00:05:26,935 --> 00:05:28,308
- Don't forget, I had a lot of advantages.

132
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:31,230
I was a bad student, I didn't
grow up in a big time family,

133
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,115
so I had a lot of advantages

134
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:35,102
because I didn't know the alternative.

135
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,010
- Yeah that's true.

136
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,592
- I didn't know what the Hamptons were.

137
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:40,955
I didn't know what, oh you
go to an Ivy League school

138
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:43,662
or a good school or fuck,
if I knew that shit,

139
00:05:43,662 --> 00:05:45,650
I should've at least did
a little bit just for,

140
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,257
if it was just Michigan,
Wisconsin, or Indiana right,

141
00:05:49,257 --> 00:05:50,525
I woulda been like oh,

142
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:51,393
(laughing)

143
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:54,401
I didn't even know that meant anything.

144
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:57,455
I was in a such an
immigrant, insular cocoon

145
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:59,675
in my own head, in my own little family,

146
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:02,202
I didn't even do like
extracurricular activities,

147
00:06:02,202 --> 00:06:04,003
it was just insular.

148
00:06:04,003 --> 00:06:05,132
It was super weird.

149
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:06,543
- When did you say you figured that out?

150
00:06:06,543 --> 00:06:07,596
- The last 10 years.

151
00:06:07,596 --> 00:06:10,920
I'm like, oh that's why
it's good to go to Penn.

152
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,204
You know, like your roommate
might be fuckin', you know?

153
00:06:13,204 --> 00:06:14,661
- Yeah.

154
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:15,494
That's very true.

155
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:16,399
- Like I didn't know.

156
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,363
That's given me an unbelievable advantage.

157
00:06:18,363 --> 00:06:20,946
(upbeat music)

158
00:06:27,827 --> 00:06:31,435
Rumors are that, there was no music.

159
00:06:31,435 --> 00:06:33,868
- [D-Rock] I didn't use
the Airport Gary music.

160
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:36,024
- Why would you not use
the Airport Gary music

161
00:06:36,024 --> 00:06:37,645
when I'm turning into Airport Gary?

162
00:06:37,645 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
