1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:02,162
(laughs)

2
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:04,367
- [Man] Wowww!

3
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:05,200
Okay!

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,178
- I bet you didn't think
that was comin' today!

5
00:00:07,178 --> 00:00:09,877
♫ We're unstoppable

6
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:11,253
- Super excited this morning,

7
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:12,379
got super fired up.

8
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,718
Been listening to 21 Savage & Metro Boomin

9
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:15,723
all morning.

10
00:00:15,723 --> 00:00:17,801
They just dropped an album.

11
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:19,182
That's always good,

12
00:00:19,182 --> 00:00:21,098
when Savage is

13
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:22,515
get excited here.

14
00:00:23,872 --> 00:00:24,705
What else?

15
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:27,415
Two groups of people,

16
00:00:27,415 --> 00:00:29,528
very much top of mind for me right now,

17
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:31,008
18 to 25 year olds

18
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:33,487
and 40 to 50 year olds.

19
00:00:33,487 --> 00:00:34,944
Same shit.

20
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:37,191
Lacking patience, in very different ways.

21
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:38,782
18 to 25,

22
00:00:38,782 --> 00:00:41,586
just early, young, cliche impatience.

23
00:00:41,586 --> 00:00:43,205
But the 40 to 50 year olds

24
00:00:43,205 --> 00:00:46,276
who don't realize that
(rap music playing)

25
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:47,704
who don't realize that they have

26
00:00:47,704 --> 00:00:48,877
(music stops)
their whole life

27
00:00:48,877 --> 00:00:49,710
in front of them.

28
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,624
And I know that sounds ridiculous

29
00:00:50,624 --> 00:00:52,081
to some, especially if you're under 30,

30
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:52,914
like, what?

31
00:00:52,914 --> 00:00:53,834
50's so old!

32
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:54,966
It just isn't.

33
00:00:54,966 --> 00:00:56,893
You got 25, 30, 35

34
00:00:56,893 --> 00:01:00,718
hardcore productive big-time
years in front of you.

35
00:01:00,718 --> 00:01:02,263
And to be very frank,

36
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:04,224
I'm trying to suffocate both

37
00:01:04,224 --> 00:01:05,688
the under 30 set,

38
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:07,354
and the 40 to 50 year old set.

39
00:01:07,354 --> 00:01:08,187
I don't have anything right now

40
00:01:08,187 --> 00:01:09,304
for you 30 to 40 year olds.

41
00:01:09,304 --> 00:01:10,137
(laughs)

42
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:10,970
But, you know

43
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,529
the under 30 set and the
40 to 50 year old set,

44
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:15,736
is super fascinating to me

45
00:01:15,736 --> 00:01:17,907
just huge trends in my DM's,

46
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:19,027
in my emails.

47
00:01:19,027 --> 00:01:21,912
I just can't wrap my head around people's

48
00:01:21,912 --> 00:01:23,579
lack of perspective.

49
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:25,407
And that is what I'm gonna focus on.

50
00:01:25,407 --> 00:01:27,207
Framing up the perspective,

51
00:01:27,207 --> 00:01:28,536
the reality of the situation.

52
00:01:28,536 --> 00:01:30,656
Last night's talk at Samsung

53
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:32,629
I think really had a ton of fire.

54
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:34,211
I hope Iris edits it right,

55
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:36,922
I hope we get a bunch of microclips for

56
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:37,927
Instagram for it,

57
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:40,260
Facebook, because it's just,

58
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,254
it's just a very
interesting time in my life

59
00:01:44,254 --> 00:01:46,976
as I become more in tune
with the opportunities

60
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:48,851
and the realities of the game.

61
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:51,144
It exposes the ones that aren't,

62
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:54,192
and I feel a level of guilt

63
00:01:54,192 --> 00:01:57,982
of almost responsibility
to over-communicate

64
00:01:57,982 --> 00:01:59,660
given my communication style

65
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,243
to you, to just somehow

66
00:02:02,243 --> 00:02:04,165
tweak your brain and make you see it

67
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,622
and so,

68
00:02:05,622 --> 00:02:07,491
I'm on fuckin' mission.

69
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:08,495
There he is.

70
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:09,328
- Not bad!

71
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:10,161
- Not too bad.

72
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:11,536
- Considering

73
00:02:11,536 --> 00:02:13,477
- Great to see you.

74
00:02:13,477 --> 00:02:15,143
No worries.

75
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:17,341
Matt Higgins, the brains of the operation.

76
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:18,751
- What's up?

77
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:20,174
Let's get this on.

78
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:22,507
♫ Southside

79
00:02:27,964 --> 00:02:30,942
- Now when people come out
with signature sneakers

80
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,718
(fast-forwarding noise)

81
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:34,082
When Durant comes out with something

82
00:02:34,082 --> 00:02:35,156
- Yeah exactly,

83
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,439
we dropped the KD 10.

84
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,461
- And there's only one?

85
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:38,871
- Three, but then,

86
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:39,945
each couple months it's like

87
00:02:39,945 --> 00:02:41,280
(fast-forwarding noise)

88
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,627
- Maybe we'll just call it The Vee.

89
00:02:42,627 --> 00:02:43,556
- Yeah.
- V-e-e.

90
00:02:43,556 --> 00:02:47,723
(hip hop music)
(phone texting)

91
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,680
Where's Iris?

92
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,759
She has a lot of stuff from yesterday.

93
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,399
The keynote at Samsung was

94
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,649
fuckin' loaded.

95
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:05,435
Loaded!

96
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:11,598
(phone texting)

97
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:17,987
Hey man, real pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

98
00:03:17,987 --> 00:03:18,937
- How are things?
- Good, good.

99
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:19,770
How are you doing?

100
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,603
- 'Sup man?

101
00:03:20,603 --> 00:03:21,683
How are you?

102
00:03:21,683 --> 00:03:22,734
- Pleasure, pleasure.
- Real pleasure,

103
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:23,993
sit, sit, sit.

104
00:03:23,993 --> 00:03:25,242
What's cookin'?

105
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:26,240
- Nice to meet you finally.

106
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,565
- Nice to meet you.

107
00:03:27,565 --> 00:03:29,026
Thank you, man.

108
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:30,156
So what's going on?

109
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:31,033
What can I help you with in this

110
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:32,664
short period of time we got?

111
00:03:32,664 --> 00:03:34,167
Here's the best part,

112
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:35,584
and you've heard this from me.

113
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:36,417
Go home,

114
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:37,708
this might be the best thing that

115
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,212
comes out of this meeting.

116
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:40,045
Go home and be like,

117
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:42,509
how do I get traffic
from Pinterest on Google

118
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:43,554
and just fuckin',

119
00:03:43,554 --> 00:03:45,092
give me 10 hours

120
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:45,925
- Yeah.

121
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:46,874
- If you're still playing in that field,

122
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:47,867
you love that field,

123
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:50,171
you give me 10 hours of watching videos,

124
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:51,826
reading free content,

125
00:03:51,826 --> 00:03:53,799
and then start hacking,

126
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:55,947
you're one Pin away from insanity.

127
00:03:55,947 --> 00:03:57,608
And while everybody's
looking at influencers

128
00:03:57,608 --> 00:03:58,774
and Facebook,

129
00:03:58,774 --> 00:04:01,691
and that demo against that product.

130
00:04:03,164 --> 00:04:04,053
(camera photo)
Love it.

131
00:04:04,053 --> 00:04:05,029
(camera photo)
Love it.

132
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:05,862
Take care of yourself.

133
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:06,695
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

134
00:04:06,695 --> 00:04:07,528
Try that, let me know how that goes.

135
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:08,361
- I am.

136
00:04:08,361 --> 00:04:09,746
- I don't know if you're
in the mindset for it,

137
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:11,952
but before you go away we can do

138
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:14,471
a little voiceover of a story?

139
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:17,588
- Marissa Bird and Robbie
Turnick got together

140
00:04:17,588 --> 00:04:18,505
at 9:01 am,

141
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:20,821
and were waiting for Gary V

142
00:04:20,822 --> 00:04:22,546
to pop out,

143
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:24,276
he would always be a
little bit late because his

144
00:04:24,276 --> 00:04:26,342
Russian mother would always make sure

145
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:28,304
he ate a little bit of breakfast

146
00:04:28,304 --> 00:04:29,750
like they did in the old country.

147
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,752
While Marissa and Robbie

148
00:04:31,752 --> 00:04:33,761
were super excited about either

149
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:37,975
playing basketball or hopscotch, or spud,

150
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:40,975
Gary had a different agenda in mind.

151
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:45,612
Today, they were going
to wash people's cars.

152
00:04:45,612 --> 00:04:48,442
Gary was feverishly running door to door,

153
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:49,713
ringing doorbells,

154
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:52,198
negotiating, haggling, and trying to get

155
00:04:52,198 --> 00:04:55,245
somebody to pay five
dollars to wash their car.

156
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:56,993
Finally somebody answered.

157
00:04:56,993 --> 00:04:58,746
Gary gives his best pitch,

158
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:01,834
which is met with an
unsuccessful conversion,

159
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,332
and the door closes.

160
00:05:03,332 --> 00:05:05,340
While Marissa and Robbie are shook,

161
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,093
Gary loves the fact that
he lost his first at-bat.

162
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:11,136
And is only motivated dramatically more

163
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:13,152
to go to the next home.

164
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:16,011
After 11 more minutes
and seven more doorbells

165
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:17,735
and two more rejections,

166
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:21,275
finally on the cul-de-sac down the road,

167
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:22,727
somebody bites

168
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:24,694
and the team gets to action.

169
00:05:24,694 --> 00:05:26,192
Gary rings the doorbell

170
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,696
to show the great work they've done,

171
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:29,739
which is met with a great smile and a

172
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:31,074
glass of lemonade.

173
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:32,700
And the team moves on.

174
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,287
It's 11:07, and they're
onto their next mission.

175
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:37,762
I'm so talented, it's scary.

176
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:39,097
(laughs)

177
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:39,930
- [Man] It was good?

178
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,981
- It was probably better than good,

179
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:44,565
it probably reminds me
that I might be all-time.

180
00:05:44,565 --> 00:05:48,146
The fact it's the first
time I tried to storyboard

181
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:49,301
an animation

182
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:51,403
and I did it improv in one take,

183
00:05:51,403 --> 00:05:53,289
and it was that remarkable.

184
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:54,131
Yeah I mean it's difficult,

185
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,977
it's difficult for me to

186
00:05:55,977 --> 00:05:57,388
comprehend my talent.

187
00:05:57,388 --> 00:05:58,473
That's a nice sweatshirt.

188
00:05:58,473 --> 00:05:59,385
100 percent!

189
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:00,218
- [Woman] This is my

190
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:01,422
Halloween costume.
- You are very perfect.

191
00:06:01,422 --> 00:06:02,432
- I nailed it!

192
00:06:02,432 --> 00:06:03,765
- You nailed it.

193
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:07,324
(laughs)

194
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:09,821
Guys, best Halloween costume ever.

195
00:06:09,821 --> 00:06:11,528
Look, it's me.

196
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:12,486
- It's mini-you.

197
00:06:12,486 --> 00:06:13,330
Well, actually we're like the same height

198
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,163
so it's fine.

199
00:06:14,163 --> 00:06:14,996
- Be careful.

200
00:06:14,996 --> 00:06:15,829
I fuckin',

201
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:17,617
I don't know if this is
the same fuckin' height.

202
00:06:17,617 --> 00:06:19,376
I think we've got some
confusions around here.

203
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:20,415
(laughs)

204
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,797
- Thank you so
- You're welcome.

205
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:22,662
It's awesome!

206
00:06:22,662 --> 00:06:24,874
If Tyler's saying it's bonkers,

207
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:27,300
in a world where we live bonkers

208
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,717
(laughs)

209
00:06:28,717 --> 00:06:29,550
I'm like, what is it?

210
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,632
So I'm like, rolling and I'm

211
00:06:30,632 --> 00:06:32,502
looking at my schedule and I'm like,

212
00:06:32,502 --> 00:06:34,429
am I flying to Australia,

213
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:37,598
giving four speeches
on two hours of sleep,

214
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:40,598
and then flying back 30 hours later?

215
00:06:41,436 --> 00:06:43,206
Vlog, the answer is yes.

216
00:06:43,206 --> 00:06:45,058
- [Man] You have no idea

217
00:06:45,058 --> 00:06:46,985
how grateful I am to you.

218
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:48,071
I mean just for what you do

219
00:06:48,071 --> 00:06:49,319
day in and day out.

220
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,896
I think the difference that you're making

221
00:06:51,896 --> 00:06:53,075
in people's lives

222
00:06:53,075 --> 00:06:54,659
is staggering!

223
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:55,492
- Listen, man,

224
00:06:55,492 --> 00:06:57,533
I don't even want to begin to tell you

225
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:59,245
if I can live long enough,

226
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:01,416
I can have a real profound impact.

227
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,624
- Yeah.
- And I can feel it

228
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:04,540
running through my entire soul.

229
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,540
And I'm completely, like

230
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:09,131
weirded out by it

231
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:10,762
in an incredibly exciting way.

232
00:07:10,762 --> 00:07:12,301
- Sure.
- I mean this is

233
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:14,385
absolutely potentially my great legacy.

234
00:07:14,385 --> 00:07:15,218
- Yeah.

235
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:17,183
- And I actually am
struggling to figure out

236
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:18,889
how it's not gonna be.

237
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:19,722
- Right.

238
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:21,223
- Because if you could really get

239
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:22,140
27 million,

240
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,809
17 million, 49 million

241
00:07:25,815 --> 00:07:27,104
'cause I think globally on this issue.

242
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:27,937
- True.

243
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,066
- Men, 15 to 25

244
00:07:31,248 --> 00:07:34,528
to fundamentally rewire themselves

245
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:37,028
and become more noble and kind

246
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:39,172
and compassionate,

247
00:07:39,172 --> 00:07:41,070
and empathetic and grateful

248
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,153
and positive.

249
00:07:45,593 --> 00:07:46,922
- Thank you so much, man.

250
00:07:46,922 --> 00:07:47,755
- Such a pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

251
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:48,669
- Such a pleasure, my friend.

252
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,713
Hey everybody this is Gary Vay-ner-chuk,

253
00:07:50,713 --> 00:07:52,425
and this is episode 270 of the

254
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:53,842
#AskGaryVee Show.

255
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,592
Hey Alexa!

256
00:07:55,592 --> 00:07:57,011
Buy my soap!

257
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:58,846
- [Alexa] Did you want me to find soap?

258
00:07:58,846 --> 00:07:59,722
- Yes!

259
00:07:59,722 --> 00:08:00,555
- Got it.

260
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:01,644
- I mean this is,

261
00:08:01,644 --> 00:08:03,263
hey Alexa, buy this!

262
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:04,436
I mean, that's it.

263
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:06,520
I just bought Dove men's soap.

264
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,391
- Order placed.

265
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,985
By the way, I can now
send you notifications

266
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:11,773
about future shipping updates.

267
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:12,650
- Hey Alexa,

268
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,299
buy an iPhone charger!

269
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:15,396
- Okay.

270
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:16,400
- Just buying shit here on the

271
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,735
#AskGaryVee Show today.
(laughs)

272
00:08:17,735 --> 00:08:18,850
You know, and even watching you guys

273
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,191
and even watching Seth right now,

274
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:22,124
imagine brushing your
teeth in the morning,

275
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:24,074
remembering that you need socks,

276
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:26,123
and saying in your bathroom,

277
00:08:26,123 --> 00:08:28,463
hey Google, hey Apple,
hey Alexa, hey Facebook

278
00:08:28,463 --> 00:08:30,001
or whatever else comes out,

279
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:30,834
I need,

280
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:31,835
and now the question becomes,

281
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:33,130
why was that Dove?

282
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,587
And who has the power?

283
00:08:34,587 --> 00:08:37,211
You think end caps at retail
at Walmart are powerful?

284
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:38,633
Fuckin' Amazon.

285
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,414
Why do they choose that?

286
00:08:40,414 --> 00:08:41,726
How much do you pay

287
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,256
to be the first result?

288
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:45,956
You think Google AdWords are expensive?

289
00:08:45,956 --> 00:08:47,142
I don't think people understand

290
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:48,436
what the fuck is actually coming.

291
00:08:48,436 --> 00:08:51,327
Making anything happen, D-Rock?

292
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:52,865
I mean you've been,

293
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,612
you've been sitting here so I feel like

294
00:08:54,612 --> 00:08:55,971
you should be making something happen.

295
00:08:55,971 --> 00:08:56,971
- [Man] Yes.

296
00:08:58,642 --> 00:08:59,929
- Hi, Gary.
- Hi.

297
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:00,771
How are you, hi.

298
00:09:00,771 --> 00:09:01,787
What happened in the 50's,

299
00:09:01,787 --> 00:09:03,343
60's, 70's, 80's, 90's,

300
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:04,585
even in the early 2000's

301
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,122
was the golden era of
television, print and radio.

302
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:09,368
That was a world where
the consumer was there

303
00:09:09,368 --> 00:09:11,249
and the pictures and
videos and written words

304
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:13,339
that fit that medium were perfect.

305
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:14,297
And it was great!

306
00:09:14,297 --> 00:09:15,464
It was a lot of fun.

307
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:17,577
Let's not forget, prior to television,

308
00:09:17,577 --> 00:09:19,295
the radio dominated.

309
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:20,636
And the people that knew
how to write jingles

310
00:09:20,636 --> 00:09:22,651
and make sounds that
had great written words.

311
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:25,887
Because we've lived in the TV print era

312
00:09:25,887 --> 00:09:27,640
of the last 50 years, 60 years,

313
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,248
people didn't want to give it up

314
00:09:29,248 --> 00:09:31,024
when the internet came along in '95,

315
00:09:31,024 --> 00:09:32,609
'cause that was a long run of 50 years!

316
00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:33,695
That's the way it was.

317
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,353
Starting in 1995 with Windows '95,

318
00:09:36,353 --> 00:09:38,611
the internet became consumerized.

319
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,822
Normal people started
getting on the internet.

320
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:43,372
And now we're 20 years into that.

321
00:09:43,372 --> 00:09:44,620
There's full maturity.

322
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,408
There's people that are now at scale,

323
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:48,033
we buy things on the internet.

324
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:49,618
The internet controls our attention,

325
00:09:49,618 --> 00:09:51,561
now it's with us at all times.

326
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:53,811
And so, the consumer moved.

327
00:09:54,812 --> 00:09:56,287
The advertising industry

328
00:09:56,287 --> 00:09:58,485
doesn't get to choose.

329
00:09:58,485 --> 00:10:00,472
It has to move to where
the eyeballs and ears

330
00:10:00,472 --> 00:10:02,469
and attention of the consumer is.

331
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,473
There's a lot of,

332
00:10:03,473 --> 00:10:05,644
there's five major holding companies

333
00:10:05,644 --> 00:10:07,543
that make billions of dollars

334
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:09,226
that don't want it to change.

335
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:10,393
Why do we love

336
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,742
Zeus or Spider-Man?

337
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:15,439
Right?

338
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:16,324
Why do we love these things?

339
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,810
We love as human beings

340
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,285
origin stories.

341
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,618
These luxury brands, literally,

342
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:24,654
have the best origin stories.

343
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:27,330
Yet, because of the
limitation of television,

344
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,118
outdoor billboards, and print,

345
00:10:29,118 --> 00:10:31,121
they've never been able to tell them!

346
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:32,247
This is a documentary,

347
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:34,586
every fashion brand in the world

348
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:36,630
should make four documentaries

349
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,505
of how it happened.

350
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:39,968
That is propaganda.

351
00:10:39,968 --> 00:10:40,838
That is media.

352
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:41,959
That is marketing.

353
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:43,683
And the fact that you can post that

354
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:44,821
in a Facebook environment and have

355
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:46,057
millions of people see it.

356
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:47,845
You don't need to make
a deal with the BBC.

357
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:50,003
Netflix doesn't have to pick it up.

358
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:51,450
This is incredible flexibility,

359
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,923
this is the greatest
time for luxury brands.

360
00:10:53,923 --> 00:10:55,397
But yet,

361
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:58,311
they hold on, they hold on because

362
00:10:58,311 --> 00:11:00,151
they put themselves on a pedestal

363
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:01,986
and they've looked down

364
00:11:01,986 --> 00:11:04,203
at the modern communication tools.

365
00:11:04,203 --> 00:11:05,770
Much to their detriment.

366
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,966
Hey Alexa, buy this!

367
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:07,947
- [Alexa] Order placed.

368
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:09,189
By the way, I can now--

369
00:11:09,189 --> 00:11:10,194
- I just bought

370
00:11:10,194 --> 00:11:12,361
a 30 dollar pair of boots.

371
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:15,963
Just right now.

372
00:11:15,963 --> 00:11:17,043
So, how

373
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,378
- [Alexa] I don't understand.

374
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:19,504
- Alexa, stop.

375
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:22,337
How I think people need to realize

376
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,097
how to be the boot that comes up on Alexa

377
00:11:27,097 --> 00:11:29,059
when people ask for a coat or a boot

378
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:30,290
or an umbrella or a sneaker--

379
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,741
- [Alexa] Sorry, I'm not sure

380
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:32,844
- Alexa, stop.

381
00:11:32,844 --> 00:11:34,684
I think this is incredibly powerful.

382
00:11:34,684 --> 00:11:36,228
I don't think people understand.

383
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,440
People are just now trying
to figure out influencer

384
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,781
or Facebook and Instagram,

385
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:41,244
and the world's already moved

386
00:11:41,244 --> 00:11:43,154
to the next frontier of voice.

387
00:11:43,154 --> 00:11:44,443
Listen,

388
00:11:44,443 --> 00:11:48,076
if the fashion brands,
the high luxury brands

389
00:11:48,076 --> 00:11:49,992
think it's complicated now,

390
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:51,600
and it feels tight now,

391
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,249
wait 'til they see the next 10 years.

392
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:56,836
The biggest, most historic
brands of our time

393
00:11:56,836 --> 00:11:59,541
are going to go out of business.

394
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,208
(phone texting)

395
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,553
- [Man] Good time for
a little update, too?

396
00:12:12,553 --> 00:12:14,184
- I've been working.

397
00:12:14,184 --> 00:12:16,851
(phone texting)

398
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:24,242
(dramatic hip hop music)

399
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:35,499
Tell me I'm wrong on this issue.

400
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:36,788
Just like, Calv.

401
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:39,754
Can somebody make me feel good about

402
00:12:39,754 --> 00:12:41,171
me being wrong here?

403
00:12:41,171 --> 00:12:42,384
It's fuckin

404
00:12:42,384 --> 00:12:43,754
an hour and a half in,

405
00:12:43,754 --> 00:12:45,165
there's 17 of us,

406
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,633
and I don't have a BSU.

407
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:49,261
- Came out at one, the episode.

408
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:50,458
And then--
- Great.

409
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,590
That's even worse, keep going.

410
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,844
- And the next morning,

411
00:12:52,844 --> 00:12:53,761
the video now

412
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:54,853
- I just, I can't wrap my

413
00:12:54,853 --> 00:12:56,391
this is,

414
00:12:56,391 --> 00:12:57,633
you guys know me.

415
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:59,688
I'm not in the one strike policy.

416
00:12:59,688 --> 00:13:01,737
I'm not in the three strike policy.

417
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:05,404
Like, we have 17 fuckin'
people on our team!

418
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:09,574
You just texted last, don't worry.

419
00:13:09,574 --> 00:13:10,407
I'm not,

420
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:11,240
I don't even know!

421
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,157
I don't even know,

422
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:13,289
I just take it as one collective,

423
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:14,421
we suck shit.

424
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:15,838
There's 17 of us.

425
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:21,085
I care about like four things

426
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:22,728
that I bring up.

427
00:13:22,728 --> 00:13:25,895
We just need to figure it out, please.

428
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,990
That sucked.

429
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:40,558
(phone texting)

430
00:13:55,415 --> 00:13:57,911
Guys, I'm always right if
I complain about something

431
00:13:57,911 --> 00:14:00,540
'cause I never complain
about anything ever!

432
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,540
It's binary.

433
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,646
- Right, but

434
00:14:03,646 --> 00:14:04,479
- The end.

435
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:05,620
There's not buts and more importantly,

436
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,297
what's way more ridiculous

437
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:09,178
is I can deal with anything.

438
00:14:09,178 --> 00:14:11,378
But the audacity not to communicate

439
00:14:11,378 --> 00:14:12,638
that we're gonna deliver on it,

440
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:13,721
is ludicrous!

441
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,725
You can fuckin' post it at 3:40

442
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:18,994
if you can make me understand why.

443
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:21,647
But, there's no way out of this

444
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:22,698
with a but,

445
00:14:22,698 --> 00:14:25,605
because there wasn't even the

446
00:14:25,605 --> 00:14:27,188
respect or kindness

447
00:14:28,705 --> 00:14:30,622
to even acknowledge

448
00:14:30,622 --> 00:14:32,067
that it wasn't gonna happen.

449
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:33,495
And more importantly, why?

450
00:14:33,495 --> 00:14:34,995
Why are we behind?

451
00:14:37,073 --> 00:14:37,906
I got it.

452
00:14:37,906 --> 00:14:40,797
Then I wanna hear from
you at 2:30 in the morning

453
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,833
that I expect us to be an hour late.

454
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,337
Because then I'll say, no.

455
00:14:45,337 --> 00:14:46,294
And I'll say, Baban wake up,

456
00:14:46,294 --> 00:14:47,914
help him.

457
00:14:47,914 --> 00:14:49,632
Like, I don't get it.

458
00:14:49,632 --> 00:14:50,671
If we're gonna have,

459
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:52,262
at a macro

460
00:14:52,262 --> 00:14:53,638
I don't care about you tripped

461
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:55,931
and the fuckin' hard drive
went into the garbage

462
00:14:55,931 --> 00:14:57,225
at a macro.

463
00:14:57,225 --> 00:14:59,019
If we're gonna make a
commitment to a time,

464
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:00,228
then let's deliver on the time.

465
00:15:00,228 --> 00:15:01,772
We're not doing it right!

466
00:15:01,772 --> 00:15:03,479
And we have no excuses.

467
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:04,312
So like,

468
00:15:05,244 --> 00:15:06,494
we just don't.

469
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:08,946
So like, we need to start
asking each other for help.

470
00:15:08,946 --> 00:15:12,238
Doing something, because
it's not working for me.

471
00:15:12,238 --> 00:15:13,619
It's not working for me.

472
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:14,583
So,

473
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,574
when it doesn't work for me,

474
00:15:16,574 --> 00:15:17,991
that's a problem.

475
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,597
(floaty pop music)

476
00:15:37,724 --> 00:15:38,557
Vlog,

477
00:15:38,557 --> 00:15:39,849
you need to follow this man.

478
00:15:39,849 --> 00:15:41,120
- Hey, what's going on?
- It'd be a really

479
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,953
good decision, vlog.

480
00:15:41,953 --> 00:15:43,011
- Follow this guy.

481
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,861
- I'm sure some cool Instagram pop up

482
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:45,980
just came up here and post at it.

483
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,147
(laughs)
I'm sure it's phenomenal.

484
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:47,980
You won't regret it.

485
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,813
- Thank you man.

486
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:49,646
Appreciate you.

487
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:51,111
- What's that?

488
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:54,028
(floaty pop music)

489
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,827
(phone texting)

490
00:16:03,772 --> 00:16:05,049
We doin' all hands on?

491
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:06,927
- [Man] Yup.
- Let's go.

492
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:09,677
(dramatic music)

493
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:22,055
(audience applauding)

494
00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:23,555
Hello hello hello.

495
00:16:24,763 --> 00:16:25,596
Thank you.

496
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:29,191
Good afternoon, VaynerMedia.

497
00:16:29,191 --> 00:16:30,524
Happy Halloween.

498
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,476
Today's all hands on is

499
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:36,908
to announce a little fun
thing that I'd like to do

500
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:38,406
which is that

501
00:16:38,406 --> 00:16:40,989
nine individuals at VaynerMedia

502
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:45,445
will be going to Helsinki, Finland.

503
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:47,250
Yup.

504
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,836
(audience laughs)

505
00:16:49,836 --> 00:16:52,547
We do some random shit
around here sometimes!

506
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:53,795
(audience applauding)

507
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:54,863
Have a great day, see ya.

508
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:58,030
(audience applauding)

509
00:17:00,146 --> 00:17:01,260
(laughs)

510
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,260
Maybe I'll nominate you.

511
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:09,250
Good to see you.

512
00:17:11,794 --> 00:17:12,627
Good to see ya!

513
00:17:12,627 --> 00:17:14,232
Hey!

514
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:15,065
Hey!

515
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:17,200
What's up, man?

516
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:18,034
How are you?

517
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:19,352
- Good.

518
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:22,661
- You think you're
getting any nominations?

519
00:17:22,661 --> 00:17:25,325
Are you gonna jockey for it?

520
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:27,305
You think you'll get any nominations?

521
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:28,768
- Maybe!

522
00:17:28,768 --> 00:17:30,794
- Have you been kind
to your fellow homies?

523
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:31,879
- You wanna ask?

524
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:34,015
- Helsinki, anybody?

525
00:17:34,015 --> 00:17:36,366
Travis let's talk about
something way more important.

526
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:37,423
Helsinki.

527
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,720
- All you have to do is
send an email about me.

528
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,763
- He's gonna try to get
people drunk with some whiskey

529
00:17:42,763 --> 00:17:44,308
and then say, hey!

530
00:17:44,308 --> 00:17:46,270
Send the Helsinki fuckin' email!

531
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,098
Hey bro, you like bourbon?

532
00:17:48,098 --> 00:17:49,770
(laughs)
I like Helskini.

533
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,769
How you guys doing?

534
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,278
- Good!

535
00:17:52,278 --> 00:17:53,944
Excited!

536
00:17:53,944 --> 00:17:55,064
- I think you'll get zero nominations.

537
00:17:55,064 --> 00:17:55,897
- I agree!

538
00:17:58,153 --> 00:17:58,986
- How are you, man?

539
00:17:58,986 --> 00:17:59,819
- Good.

540
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:00,652
- Good to see ya.

541
00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:01,485
Helsinki?

542
00:18:01,485 --> 00:18:02,318
- Yeah.

543
00:18:02,318 --> 00:18:03,151
- Helsinki!

544
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:06,484
(uplifting piano music)

545
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:14,998
- Jay Shetty.

546
00:18:14,998 --> 00:18:15,956
- Hi, Jay.

547
00:18:15,956 --> 00:18:16,789
How are you, man?

548
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:17,622
- Good to see you, man,

549
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:18,455
finally.
- Great things about you,

550
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:19,288
brother.

551
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:20,121
- It's fine.

552
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:20,954
- Thank you, my man.

553
00:18:20,954 --> 00:18:21,787
How are things?

554
00:18:21,787 --> 00:18:22,620
Sit sit sit.

555
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,723
- Thank you, man.

556
00:18:23,723 --> 00:18:25,683
- Jay interviewed me at
NASDAQ a little while ago

557
00:18:25,683 --> 00:18:26,920
and we started following each other

558
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,393
and I just kind of became
obsessed with his content,

559
00:18:29,393 --> 00:18:30,397
just in general.

560
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:31,230
I think I mentioned this

561
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,706
to you.
- You did, I dug in,

562
00:18:32,706 --> 00:18:34,473
I saw the pretty eyes.

563
00:18:34,473 --> 00:18:35,306
(laughs)

564
00:18:35,306 --> 00:18:37,033
I filled in the whole thing.

565
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,397
- Relationships I think is huge.

566
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:39,622
- I agree.

567
00:18:39,622 --> 00:18:42,270
From a guy's perspective.
- Yeah, exactly.

568
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,160
- He had, I saw one of them.

569
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,225
One of the two videos that went
completely viral on Facebook

570
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:50,355
on relationships was like,

571
00:18:50,355 --> 00:18:51,458
it's very relatable.

572
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,619
It's not just for guys,

573
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:54,749
girls are gonna love this stuff
that he's talking about too.

574
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:55,672
- It's cool to meet you man,

575
00:18:55,672 --> 00:18:56,505
where do you live, here?

576
00:18:56,505 --> 00:18:57,461
- I'm based out of New York,

577
00:18:57,461 --> 00:18:58,671
but I travel so much for work.

578
00:18:58,671 --> 00:18:59,837
London

579
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:01,678
- And what are you doing now?

580
00:19:01,678 --> 00:19:03,251
- So, I'm basically

581
00:19:03,251 --> 00:19:04,342
just social video.

582
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:05,175
- Yeah.

583
00:19:05,175 --> 00:19:06,687
- Social video, branded sponsored content,

584
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,598
workshops,
- Yep.

585
00:19:07,598 --> 00:19:08,475
Understood.

586
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:09,308
Yep.

587
00:19:09,308 --> 00:19:10,141
Real pleasure to meet you.

588
00:19:10,141 --> 00:19:11,058
Good luck to you.
- Thank you so much.

589
00:19:11,058 --> 00:19:12,341
- Yeah I hope we get
to see each other soon.

590
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:13,810
- Me too.
- For sure.

591
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,857
(phone texting)

592
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:17,774
No worries.

593
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:20,741
Dinner, or

594
00:19:20,741 --> 00:19:22,436
self promotional but

595
00:19:22,436 --> 00:19:24,944
I think the merit of
the creative ultimately

596
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:26,958
plays itself out, right?

597
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,372
Do I think I'm gonna win a
hell of a lot of business

598
00:19:29,372 --> 00:19:32,424
super long-term, because
I'm gonna be proven to

599
00:19:32,424 --> 00:19:33,544
be historically correct?

600
00:19:33,544 --> 00:19:34,508
Absolutely.

601
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,045
Just the truths, right?

602
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:39,337
I don't really focus on
anything other than my truths.

603
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:40,800
I've been blown away by how,

604
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,261
it's worked better than I thought.

605
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:44,625
So my intuition is, yeah.

606
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,838
It is.

607
00:19:45,838 --> 00:19:48,816
(phone texting)

608
00:19:48,816 --> 00:19:50,308
(dramatic music)

609
00:19:50,308 --> 00:19:52,682
(phone texting)

610
00:19:52,682 --> 00:19:55,432
(dramatic music)

611
00:19:56,818 --> 00:19:59,072
(dramatic music)

612
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,475
(phone texting)

613
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:02,308
Pleasure.

614
00:20:02,308 --> 00:20:03,141
- Same here.

615
00:20:03,141 --> 00:20:04,189
- How are you my man?
- Doing good, doing good.

616
00:20:04,189 --> 00:20:05,022
- Real pleasure.

617
00:20:05,022 --> 00:20:05,989
Hey.
- What's up, sir?

618
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:06,822
- How are you?

619
00:20:06,822 --> 00:20:07,817
- Nice to meet you.
- Such a pleasure.

620
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:09,153
How you doing?

621
00:20:09,153 --> 00:20:09,986
- Great, man, great.

622
00:20:09,986 --> 00:20:10,993
- Sit, get comfortable.

623
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:11,826
How's life?

624
00:20:11,826 --> 00:20:12,777
- Great.

625
00:20:12,777 --> 00:20:15,795
I know you always on the move, on the go.

626
00:20:15,795 --> 00:20:16,628
- Yep.

627
00:20:16,628 --> 00:20:18,094
- So, bruh, what's sleep?

628
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:18,929
Like how often?

629
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:21,008
- My man, sleep is important.

630
00:20:21,008 --> 00:20:22,854
I'm not worried about how
many hours people sleep,

631
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,467
I'm worried about what they're
doing when they're awake.

632
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:25,507
- Mmm!

633
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:27,805
- I'm trying to get
six, seven, eight hours.

634
00:20:27,805 --> 00:20:29,222
Like the body is
- Mmm!

635
00:20:29,222 --> 00:20:30,055
- Not jokin' around.

636
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:31,050
Like, I got a little bit,

637
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,011
I was just complainin', I'm
goin' to Australia next week

638
00:20:34,011 --> 00:20:36,937
for two days and I'm
only sleeping two hours.

639
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:38,690
I don't know what my
assistant was thinking.

640
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,769
(laughs)

641
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:41,238
People are just wasting their at-bat.

642
00:20:41,238 --> 00:20:42,071
- Man!

643
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:44,698
Heyy, I like that!

644
00:20:44,698 --> 00:20:47,948
You on deck, you wait, you
try to get your opportunity,

645
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:49,028
then you too tired to hit the goddamn

646
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:49,992
- A hundred percent.

647
00:20:49,992 --> 00:20:52,952
And then you prefer to sit
and dwell and complain.

648
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:53,785
- Mmm.

649
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,959
- And people just come
up with a million reasons

650
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,463
why not to do.

651
00:20:57,463 --> 00:20:59,837
I just get so many kids who wanna be you.

652
00:20:59,837 --> 00:21:00,713
- Yeah.

653
00:21:00,713 --> 00:21:02,797
- And a lot of them

654
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:05,807
don't have much, and I'm like

655
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:08,051
Work at Chick-Fil-A, save
your money, go in a studio!

656
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:08,884
- Exactly.

657
00:21:08,884 --> 00:21:10,971
- I mean like, I don't know,

658
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:12,428
what do you want me to tell you?

659
00:21:12,428 --> 00:21:13,310
- Yeah.

660
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,021
- And then what's even
crazier, actually, is

661
00:21:15,021 --> 00:21:18,325
the shit you can now do that doesn't even

662
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:19,742
need studio time.

663
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:21,742
Right?

664
00:21:21,742 --> 00:21:23,389
It's not what you and
I grew up with, right?

665
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:24,532
I mean the technology's

666
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:25,652
you know what this is?

667
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:26,485
- I know what,

668
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:27,318
a studio!

669
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:28,317
(laughs)
- This is a studio!

670
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:29,826
That's exactly what it is!

671
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:31,579
(group laughs)

672
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:34,824
It's just suffocating out excuses.

673
00:21:34,824 --> 00:21:35,741
- Oh my god!

674
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:36,583
(laughs)

675
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,622
- You know, right?

676
00:21:37,622 --> 00:21:38,644
Is there anything that

677
00:21:38,644 --> 00:21:40,838
since we got time together,
is there anything that

678
00:21:40,838 --> 00:21:43,955
stands out that I can
answer, I can help with,

679
00:21:43,955 --> 00:21:44,965
is there anything we can do?

680
00:21:44,965 --> 00:21:47,676
- Yeah, and I run into a theme where,

681
00:21:47,676 --> 00:21:49,261
and he'll tell you where he's like, bruh,

682
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:50,428
you need to tweet something,

683
00:21:50,428 --> 00:21:51,421
you need to IG,

684
00:21:51,421 --> 00:21:52,338
- And it's not your

685
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:53,377
natural state.
- It's hard for me

686
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:54,210
How do I
- Let me tell you,

687
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,227
as somebody who goes
the complete other way,

688
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:57,060
- Yeah.

689
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,236
- And peacocks, you know?
(laughs)

690
00:21:58,236 --> 00:21:59,069
- Yeah.

691
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,276
- It's probably the way you
feel about your music, man.

692
00:22:02,276 --> 00:22:04,355
I feel so good about what I'm saying

693
00:22:04,355 --> 00:22:05,188
- Yeah.

694
00:22:05,188 --> 00:22:06,607
- That I'm willing to take the heat.

695
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:07,440
- Okay.

696
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,273
- You know how many
people don't put out music

697
00:22:08,273 --> 00:22:09,318
'cause they don't want to take the heat?

698
00:22:09,318 --> 00:22:10,151
- Mmm.

699
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:11,152
- Most of them.

700
00:22:11,152 --> 00:22:12,033
- Most of them.

701
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:15,260
- So you need to not
talk when he wants you to

702
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,036
'cause it's smart strategy.

703
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,516
You need to find a way to,
when you feel something,

704
00:22:19,516 --> 00:22:20,373
to talk.

705
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:21,378
- Okay.

706
00:22:21,378 --> 00:22:22,498
- Right?

707
00:22:22,498 --> 00:22:23,740
If you can convert it,

708
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,174
in the way you think about music,

709
00:22:25,174 --> 00:22:26,515
the reason I put out so much shit is

710
00:22:26,515 --> 00:22:27,937
I got something to say!

711
00:22:27,937 --> 00:22:30,155
Listen, if you did a
fuckin' Instagram story

712
00:22:30,155 --> 00:22:31,234
right now and said,

713
00:22:31,234 --> 00:22:33,202
I'm taking an intern
to be my videographer,

714
00:22:33,202 --> 00:22:34,558
I'm not gonna pay you shit,

715
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:37,222
and you get to follow me
around and make videos

716
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:38,807
and put it out,

717
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:41,106
fuckin' 10,000 people raising their hand!

718
00:22:41,106 --> 00:22:41,942
(laughs)

719
00:22:41,942 --> 00:22:43,648
You know how many people
would rip their arm off

720
00:22:43,648 --> 00:22:46,023
that love you more than life to do that?

721
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:48,234
Two years ago when I decided
to film everything I did,

722
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:49,506
I'm like,

723
00:22:49,506 --> 00:22:51,357
that's some douchey-ass shit, right?

724
00:22:51,357 --> 00:22:52,692
(laughs)
Like how am I going to

725
00:22:52,692 --> 00:22:54,484
explain that, you know?

726
00:22:54,484 --> 00:22:56,949
But I just knew it was right.

727
00:22:56,949 --> 00:22:59,329
Like in the world that I live in my dome,

728
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:01,094
imagine all those videos
we could be watching

729
00:23:01,094 --> 00:23:02,754
of when Pac and Biggie were friends?

730
00:23:02,754 --> 00:23:04,124
- Oh my God!

731
00:23:04,124 --> 00:23:05,674
- You know how fun this is?

732
00:23:05,674 --> 00:23:07,793
My man, you and I are
gonna sit there and break

733
00:23:07,793 --> 00:23:10,010
and eat some food in 13 years

734
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,926
and pull up our phone or whatever,

735
00:23:11,926 --> 00:23:13,046
and watch this!

736
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:13,879
- Yeah.

737
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:15,548
- And by the way, let
me go on a real crazy

738
00:23:15,548 --> 00:23:16,466
left turn on you.

739
00:23:16,466 --> 00:23:17,299
- Okay.

740
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:18,602
- You're just gonna like having this

741
00:23:18,602 --> 00:23:19,641
when you're an old man,

742
00:23:19,641 --> 00:23:22,398
because your kids are
gonna be able to watch it.

743
00:23:22,398 --> 00:23:23,231
- Yeah.

744
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:24,064
That's real.

745
00:23:24,064 --> 00:23:24,976
- In the world that I live in,

746
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:26,868
my kids, my great-great-grandkids

747
00:23:26,868 --> 00:23:28,610
long after I'm gone,

748
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,694
are gonna sell this meeting,

749
00:23:30,694 --> 00:23:33,405
sell it as virtual
reality and they're gonna

750
00:23:33,405 --> 00:23:35,407
be actually sitting right there.

751
00:23:35,407 --> 00:23:36,290
- Man.

752
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,741
- 'Cause they think you're cool,
'cause they think I'm cool,

753
00:23:37,741 --> 00:23:39,001
'cause I'm their great-grandpappy

754
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,085
and they're gonna sell it!

755
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:41,961
- Mmm.

756
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:43,041
- Yeah it's crazy!

757
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,039
(laughs)
But I promise you

758
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,821
the guy that drew Batman

759
00:23:45,821 --> 00:23:47,904
never thought in 70 years

760
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:52,259
there's gonna be billion
dollar movies made.

761
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:54,593
You can't project that far out.

762
00:23:54,593 --> 00:23:55,429
- Right.

763
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:56,886
- But I can!

764
00:23:56,886 --> 00:23:58,000
(laughs)
A little bit, a little bit.

765
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,016
A little bit.

766
00:23:59,016 --> 00:24:00,758
There's something else
I've been thinkin' about,

767
00:24:00,758 --> 00:24:03,231
I want to throw you since
the vibes I'm feelin'.

768
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:05,355
This is something, you haven't
heard this one yet from me.

769
00:24:05,355 --> 00:24:06,481
- No, let's go!

770
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:07,776
(laughs)
Bring it on!

771
00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:09,192
- I have a concept that I haven't seen.

772
00:24:09,192 --> 00:24:10,025
- Okay.

773
00:24:10,025 --> 00:24:12,646
- Song comes out, album
comes out, project comes out.

774
00:24:12,646 --> 00:24:13,896
Something pops!

775
00:24:14,873 --> 00:24:18,873
In movies, they come out
with number two, quick.

776
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:22,379
You put out, right,

777
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:23,749
Guardians of the Galaxy.

778
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:25,038
You're like, what the fuck happened?

779
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:26,338
It blows up in the theater,

780
00:24:26,338 --> 00:24:28,341
they're fuckin' in
production on number two,

781
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,264
from the bat!

782
00:24:29,264 --> 00:24:30,425
You write a song.

783
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:31,667
It's about what you're goin' through

784
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:32,724
with your girl.

785
00:24:32,724 --> 00:24:34,175
With your best friend.

786
00:24:34,175 --> 00:24:35,841
With somebody sick in your family.

787
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:36,841
And it goes.

788
00:24:37,751 --> 00:24:41,385
Well it's been some time
in between you writing that

789
00:24:41,385 --> 00:24:43,132
and now it happening.

790
00:24:43,132 --> 00:24:43,965
- Mmm.

791
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,649
- To write the update,

792
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:49,564
and piggy back off the momentum is

793
00:24:49,564 --> 00:24:51,265
something I've never seen.

794
00:24:51,265 --> 00:24:52,153
- So quick question.

795
00:24:52,153 --> 00:24:52,986
- Yes sir.

796
00:24:52,986 --> 00:24:54,028
- Would that not be considered a remix?

797
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:56,414
- No, because remixes
are other people's ideas

798
00:24:56,414 --> 00:24:58,689
on top of it.
- Well it could be your ideas.

799
00:24:58,689 --> 00:25:00,657
- The remix is

800
00:25:00,657 --> 00:25:03,780
some form of a collaboration
that's building off

801
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,499
the equity of the popularity.

802
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:07,583
There used to not be
anything called the remix.

803
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:08,416
- Right.

804
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:09,249
- I'm old.

805
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:10,082
(laughs)

806
00:25:10,082 --> 00:25:10,915
When I grew up,

807
00:25:10,915 --> 00:25:11,919
there was no remix.

808
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,386
There isn't something
called the follow up,

809
00:25:14,386 --> 00:25:15,524
or the update.

810
00:25:15,524 --> 00:25:17,074
But I think it can happen.

811
00:25:17,074 --> 00:25:18,595
The speed in which you can do things,

812
00:25:18,595 --> 00:25:20,052
that's,

813
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,143
that fuckin' excites

814
00:25:21,143 --> 00:25:22,385
because I'm in it, you have to understand

815
00:25:22,385 --> 00:25:24,011
who I am as a listener.

816
00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:25,433
I'm in it for the story.

817
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:26,571
- Mmm.
- Right.

818
00:25:26,571 --> 00:25:28,225
- You're not just talking
about going to the club

819
00:25:28,225 --> 00:25:29,555
and having fun which is great

820
00:25:29,555 --> 00:25:30,559
- Yeah yeah.
- When you're

821
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,900
telling life's stories, life didn't stop!

822
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,733
And if that song went,

823
00:25:35,197 --> 00:25:38,610
and you've got a couple more
lines to add to the equation,

824
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,449
that is super interesting.

825
00:25:41,449 --> 00:25:43,579
A project that took two years to come out.

826
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:45,170
A song that resonates.

827
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,451
A truth that there is a follow-up story,

828
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:50,019
not fabricated.
- Yeah, yeah.

829
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:51,879
- That you can get generated about.

830
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:53,800
And then it comes out 11 days later,

831
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,460
and everybody's been feelin' that song

832
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,927
and now you're telling what happened?

833
00:25:57,927 --> 00:25:59,856
You're feeding 'em.

834
00:25:59,856 --> 00:26:00,689
- Yup.

835
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:03,439
(laughs)

836
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:04,356
Woww, okay!

837
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:09,347
- I bet you didn't think
that was coming today!

838
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:13,888
My man.
- Thank you, tonight.

839
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,721
- Yeah.

840
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:15,594
I'm gonna see you guys tonight.

841
00:26:15,594 --> 00:26:16,427
I'll see you guys tonight.

842
00:26:16,427 --> 00:26:17,707
Take care.

843
00:26:17,707 --> 00:26:19,362
Vlog, great way to end.

844
00:26:19,362 --> 00:26:22,136
Incredible talent, Big Krit.

845
00:26:22,136 --> 00:26:23,725
Going to Halloween now.

846
00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:25,405
Doin' that Halloween thing!

847
00:26:25,405 --> 00:26:26,577
We'll see you later.

848
00:26:26,577 --> 00:00:00,000
(hip hop music)
