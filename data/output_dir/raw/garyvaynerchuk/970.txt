<font color="#E5E5E5">and I look at my iphone and look at what</font>

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,939
Yelp scored it right so and that's

10
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,970
community you know so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,750

00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,809
know some little fat this isn't about

18
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:43,059
Twitter this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a facebook fan</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">know the internet that we know I know it</font>

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,530
went back further nerds I'm sorry but

22
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,820
I'm talking about the one that we know

23
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,339
the one that AOL started sending CDs in

24
00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:56,859
the mail is about 14 years old and if

25
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:58,300
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about the impact globally</font>

26
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,269
financially business-wise that it's had

27
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:03,309
its staggering and to be naive enough to

28
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:04,750
think that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a way</font>

29
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,300
bigger impact going forward I don't want

30
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,830
to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's gonna happen in</font>

31
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,620
five years it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a totally big ships</font>

32
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,720
these are big waves and<font color="#CCCCCC"> their constant</font>

33
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a hurricane this isn't a drizzle</font>

34
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,820
and so I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a big one on the</font>

35
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,980
wine industry you know I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what wine</font>

36
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,570
library TV has meant to wineries that

37
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,220
I've gotten good ratings or bad ratings

38
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,200
and when I can do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> as one</font>

39
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,420
individual with zero cost just sweat

40
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,610
equity and create a platform like wine

41
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,560
rbtv that has the same impact that

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,150
things like the wine spectator and

43
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,070
Robert Parker bad which about decades of

44
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,140
a head start and millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of millions of</font>

45
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">dollars and tons of infrastructure that</font>

46
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,620
needs to be paid attention to and

47
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,180
understood that it's replicated in

48
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,110
multiple platforms

49
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,510
you know I I think it's funny I think

50
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,100
there's this huge trend that everybody's

51
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,440
so excited to dis you know Parker and

52
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,290
spectator in 100 point scale but at the

53
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,450
end of the day if you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> go back</font>

54
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,440
prior to them coming along wine was this

55
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,980
big and I think that at<font color="#E5E5E5"> some level it</font>

56
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,440
made it a little bit more inclusive you

57
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,080
know people understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> what a 99 means</font>

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,400
in 100 point scale what a 81 means and

59
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">before you blame Parker and spectator</font>

60
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,370
you should blame the retailers in the

61
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,650
wineries who've made them big you know

62
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,870
if I didn't put Robert Parker shelf

63
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,970
talkers on every wine in my store or

64
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,650
when I emailed out saying 95 points

65
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,240
Parker when he wouldn't mean anything

66
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,450
right so well obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just me I</font>

67
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,280
mean everybody but you know so I think

68
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,570
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's imperative for people to</font>

69
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,790
understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it had a lot of</font>

70
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,970
value do I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that community driven</font>

71
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,610
stuff like Yelp is going to be important

72
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,800
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do that's why ball court calm and</font>

73
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,690
why I'm relaunching it now and which is

74
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,800
actually I mean we probably just

75
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,120
relaunched it by the way which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

76
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,300
amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know so yeah I mean a big</font>

77
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,220
misconception of wine library TV what I

78
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,180
do is people think I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the new</font>

79
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,800
Parker or the new spectator I have no

80
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,090
interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that I just want to build</font>

81
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,810
wine self-esteem

82
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,650
yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what's funny is</font>

83
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,840
that my dad<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a liquor store we were</font>

84
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,030
shoppers discount liquors that was the

85
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,340
store I grew up in wine was not a play

86
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,819
in my household my dad drank vodka and

87
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,980
cognac because he's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> russian boy</font>

88
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,450
that's what we do so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I first fell in</font>

89
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,650
love with wine when I realize people

90
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">collected and so my reading began at</font>

91
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">seventeen sixteen because I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

92
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">know a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it because people</font>

93
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,640
collected it that was my hook I was a

94
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,099
collector the actual loving of wine

95
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,370
started really happening at like 22 23

96
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,170
when you know it started going from

97
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,060
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a commodity to being home and I</font>

98
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,200
really like this stuff this is

99
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,390
interesting look at these crazy flavors

100
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,709
like how the heck did that just tastes

101
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:48,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> racket wall like you know those</font>

102
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,390
kind of things right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so um there was one</font>

103
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,970
specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> amarone that I had a tasting</font>

104
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,709
when I was 22 when I could really<font color="#E5E5E5"> taste</font>

105
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,599
the chocolate so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much so I walked</font>

106
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,909
outside and called my mom remember like

107
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:01,290
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> cellphones were like this big and</font>

108
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,060
you're like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like like that I</font>

109
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,579
called my mom<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was like mom it's</font>

110
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,829
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen I can taste these things</font>

111
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:09,450
I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe this but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just tasted</font>

112
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,269
chocolate and this wine and that was

113
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:13,530
probably when I was like oh this is

114
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,700
really getting good I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just enjoying</font>

115
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,120
it

116
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,079
yeah that's a great question i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

117
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,440
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i turned 30 on november 14th 2005</font>

118
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,040
and you know there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a one percent of</font>

119
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,960
unhappiness you know like okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to</font>

120
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,090
buy the new york jets and so that's

121
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,520
gonna cost a couple billion dollars am I

122
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,630
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really make a couple billion</font>

123
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,940
dollars selling just wine and the

124
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,190
realization was I could have I very much

125
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,570
feel like could have had big big things

126
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,360
happen i launched my library in 1997 but

127
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,680
the laws<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this country</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and people</font>

128
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,240
watching this video right now in<font color="#E5E5E5"> boston</font>

129
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,060
can't buy wine for me right so I want to

130
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">do something else and at the same token</font>

131
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,170
as I was feeling this itch in november i

132
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,700
went to a tasting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> december and</font>

133
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,010
realized people did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have wine</font>

134
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">self-esteem they wanted to drink the</font>

135
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,530
same old stuff they wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

136
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,180
jerk-offs to each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they</font>

137
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,200
thought they knew something cuz they

138
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,600
read it in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> latest spectator I just</font>

139
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,810
thought the wine culture had a lot of

140
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,670
opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be much cooler and you</font>

141
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,320
know there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> so many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> places around the</font>

142
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,090
world that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've traveled to where there</font>

143
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,030
isn't this you know uptight aspect to

144
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,860
the wine industry it's much more part of

145
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,020
culture and<font color="#E5E5E5"> data life and I I felt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

146
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,700
I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of character I knew my</font>

147
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,470
personality and my DNA and my hustle

148
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,720
could create this platform that not only

149
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,790
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful then by virtue of</font>

150
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,320
that success would create a different

151
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of culture so wasn't so much that I</font>

152
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">was dissatisfied as if it was just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

153
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,970
wanted to change the game again you know

154
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,950
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an amazing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feeling for me when</font>

155
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,780
i launched Wine Library<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm in 97 was</font>

156
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,840
one of the first wine shops to do so

157
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,910
less than a handful and it changed the

<font color="#E5E5E5">game it blew</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up my family business from</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you know I want to be a pioneer it's</font>

163
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,520
what I want to do and so that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

164
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,390
did with wine library TV

165
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,380
you know I if anything maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a</font>

00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit too aggressive you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

167
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:07,910

out my show what can I do<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you at the</font>

170
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,639
same token I think I don't think of that

171
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,620
as a mistake I feel as though I was a

172
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,330
little bit more raw I think you know six

173
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,199
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was a little more</font>

174
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,240
polished but I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> more selective</font>

175
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,080
every was like why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

180
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,770
crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel like wine library TV was</font>

181
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,260
itsy-bitsy tiny in 2006 but if somebody

182
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,600
hit me up they'd be really happy to have

183
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,669
the relationship today and so you know

184
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:39,740
what just hit top hit up the top 500

185
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,870
Twitter people today that's insanity

186
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,720
that its lead ism so you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> promise</font>

187
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,060
up and having a lot of hustle and and

188
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,060
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that's what I did I mean if</font>

189
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,740
a top wine bloggers was upset that I was

190
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">hitting up everybody it you know that</font>

191
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:55,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">might have been a mistake in some</font>

192
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,220
people's eyes but not in mind and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

193
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,380
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> i made a million mistakes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean i</font>

194
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,510
built a big business around me you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

195
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,490
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the most scalable thing at a</font>

196
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,169
lot of people's opinions but to me I

197
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:07,940
understand kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vision</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I see</font>

198
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,580
going forward and I try to stay away

199
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,380
from mistakes the mistakes I make are

200
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">the opportunities I haven't taken like</font>

201
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,880
big platform television things like that

202
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,479
I'm sure there's mistakes in my nose but

203
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,849
there's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> few let's get really</font>

204
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:24,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">obnoxious there's zero mistakes in my</font>

205
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,860
yeses because normally my threshold for

206
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,849
a yes is first learning not necessarily

207
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:34,729
the results I need to know this you know

208
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:36,800
I've thought about be seeing companies

209
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,199
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> never been v seed even</font>

210
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">though it's a stupid thing to do</font>

211
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,870
financially for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning process</font>

212
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,120
there was one big<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment that was the</font>

213
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,419
day i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was on Conan O'Brien show and</font>

214
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:52,580
slate com wrote a huge profile on the

215
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,849
same day and that and that and this was

216
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:58,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">in August</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about seven so Twitter was</font>

217
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,009
still a baby and that whole community we

218
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:03,860
all knew each other kinda sorta and so

219
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,479
it became like the only thing people

220
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:07,669
talked about on twitter watch Gary on

221
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:10,190
Conan which was really cool it was

222
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,930
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> my I was really starting to fray</font>

223
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,819
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tech world the web two point O</font>

224
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:15,050
world the social media world whatever

225
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,900
the heck you want to call it and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

226
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,460
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first people to kind of make</font>

227
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,259
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right oh my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> god</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he's in his office</font>

228
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:22,849
talking about why and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's now on the</font>

229
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:24,770
Conan O'Brien show and I went really

230
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,139
well on top of that so it was a big

231
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,400
moment was first time wine was getting

232
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,319
late night exposure on multiple levels

233
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,699
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an interesting an important</font>

234
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:34,219
moment both in the wine business end in

235
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:37,399
the tech space<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

236
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,990
one moment that really I can pinpoint

237
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,240
other than that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very big on</font>

238
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,950
analytics and metrics and paying

239
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,589
attention of traffic and did we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> 23%</font>

240
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:47,420
and this and that I know what I'm doing

241
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,380
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> right there's no ounce of me of that</font>

242
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,200
has any doubt and I work for myself so

243
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,240
there's no justifying it to the

244
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,209
dinosaurs that pits I my check so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I puts</font>

245
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:01,610
me in a very substantially good position

246
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,290
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of ways plus I've done it</font>

247
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">before I mean I was making lots and lots</font>

248
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,589
of money thousands of dollars a week and

249
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:09,200
some baseball cards you know I've built

I'm a marathon runner you know

capitalizing on something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

259
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,350
doesn't you know how did I with CIA you

260
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,660
know I got more exposure night lined in

00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,500
lots of more Twitter followers people

265
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">end of the day what I think is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

266
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,660
is that people have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand it's a</font>

267
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,580
marathon you know building a business

268
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,920
doesn't happen in six weeks there's no

269
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,660
shortcuts you know getting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

270
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,640
account isn't a magic potion you know

271
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,260
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you know roll up on me</font>

272
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,940
especially in 2008<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter</font>

273
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,110
account<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a great what do you want</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">cookie I mean it's a you know it's not</font>

275
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,750
going to change your business but you

276
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,310
know at the same token the people that

277
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,230
think this stuff is silly and it's not

278
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,470
important are just trying to draw lines

279
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,580
in the sand because they don't want to

280
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a part of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's a huge</font>

281
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,970
mistake because<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless you're retiring</font>

282
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,430
in next six to 12 months you better

283
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,520
understand what<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is all about inside</font>

284
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,790
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

285
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,069
my vision is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I sell so many copies</font>

286
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:31,139
a crush it that Harper Collins gets off

287
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:33,660
my back and I can wing these next<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine</font>

288
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,100
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> career it's not a</font>

289
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,339
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer</font>

290
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,660
you can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them they know exactly you</font>

291
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,250
know the funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> part is this what I love</font>

292
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,660
about is I signed with Harper<font color="#CCCCCC"> studios</font>

293
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,940
it's a totally different<font color="#E5E5E5"> model you know</font>

294
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,400
there I got offered almost as much for

295
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,110
one book as these guys gave me for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

296
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,820
but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rebs share in the back end was</font>

297
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,740
substantially more so they've changed

298
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,290
the model quite a bit and I'm betting on

299
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,510
myself right so you know obviously I

300
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,820
want to participate and win on the back

301
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,890
end so I I'm very<font color="#CCCCCC"> hungry to see what I</font>

302
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,530
can do with this book and I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

303
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:15,770
really hard at it and I'm very<font color="#E5E5E5"> confident</font>

304
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,530
I know you guys are big time and there's

305
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,460
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people going to watch this</font>

306
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,470
video so if for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> watch</font>

307
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,030
this video if you leave with one thing

308
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,890
out of this video even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though there's</font>

309
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,360
much more important things being said

310
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,980
about life and happiness and making

311
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,720
money about just playing the game

312
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,790
perfectly in my opinion this is what I

313
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,310
want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave with when you go into</font>

317
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,860

Baptist from Argentina so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is</font>

328
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,910
this I can tell you right now you are a

329
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,280
wine expert if you spend two years and

330
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,920
in that window you never order the same

331
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of wine and if you do that and then</font>

you once you hit all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wines you can</font>

different grapes you're gonna be shocked

337
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,680
of what you know and how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

338
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,360
understand your palate because everybody

339
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,770
who's watching this right now here's

340
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,120
what you're really doing you're only

341
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,780
drinking coke and sprite every meal and

342
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,080
you have no idea of root beer Hawaiian

343
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,530
Punch grape soda black cherry you have

344
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,020
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> clue tomato juice pomegranate juice</font>

345
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,630
you have no idea if you like those

346
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,520
because you're sticking to Pinot Grigio

347
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,760
and Pinot Noir please for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me try</font>

348
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">something new</font>

349
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,560
there's two countries right now that I

350
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,990
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can be very safe in finding</font>

351
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,760
some really neat stuff one is South

352
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,640
Africa if you order a Chenin Blanc or

353
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,010
find a Chenin Blanc very crisp very

354
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,350
clean very aromatic great with shellfish

355
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,480
and light salads you can get them<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

356
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,490
eight to twelve bucks all day long and

357
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:26,300
in red hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the dominant country</font>

358
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,210
and value in my opinion is Portugal you

359
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,150
know Portugal is just ripping I think

360
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,970
the quality out of Portugal for seven to

361
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,430
twelve dollars is staggering I actually

362
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,680
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a twenty20 investigation and</font>

363
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,970
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much these people are getting paid</font>

364
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,650
over there because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

365
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,270
the math of how the lines can be so good

366
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,440
and they can deliver them for<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven</font>

367
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,520
bucks so from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> douro the dow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alentejo</font>

368
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,110
these are places that really make some

369
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,760
great great portuguese wines

370
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,890
what your palate likes so the makers for

371
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,770
sure the pedigree is important right you

372
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,089
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this builder is good you know the</font>

373
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:04,890
chef's good you know this car maker is

374
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:08,370
good you've got a reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> point to</font>

375
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,630
knowing if the wine is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be good</font>

376
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,209
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is farming I don't care for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

377
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:14,550
best wine maker of all time if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> rains</font>

378
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">every day you're finished so that's also</font>

379
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">very very important what I think is most</font>

380
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,640
important when you first start learning

381
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,820
is understanding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> grape varietals</font>

382
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,240
understanding the difference between

383
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chenin Blanc and some young blanc and</font>

384
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,730
riesling and pinot noir and pinot gris

385
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,339
and there's a lot there that will really

386
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,660
be the foundation of what you like

387
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,339
the real move like the date move is to

388
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:40,470
like Google's asked you know like<font color="#CCCCCC"> asset</font>

389
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">Eric grape varietals right and just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

390
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:44,370
ask for<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know do you need late</font>

391
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,620
harvest Grenache from the banyule you

392
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,990
know totally like throw off the somme

393
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,730
with the mad skills but you've got like

394
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one move if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to be a little</font>

395
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:54,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit more authentic which I highly</font>

396
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,230
recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's imperative to</font>

397
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,170
name off three wines that you've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

398
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,699
the past that you've liked and that's

399
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:03,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">the sommelier to go in a different</font>

400
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,629
direction with varietal or from a

401
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:09,629
different country you know me and to

402
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:11,550
expand your palate I think you know

403
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,920
there's a romance with you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> being on</font>

404
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">a date of saying you know to your date</font>

405
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,579
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know let's explore some new stuff</font>

406
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,589
together kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing I like cabs but</font>

407
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:21,509
what else would I like well you might

408
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:23,370
like to Matt<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's big tannins</font>

409
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,949
a big fruit you know and so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

410
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:27,689
always be something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be my</font>

411
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:30,170
go-to move

412
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:32,779
you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we're living the</font>

413
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:35,389
Google era right I mean I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font>

414
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:37,220
learn so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much more by reading good blogs</font>

415
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,579
like the nog raphy or fermentation dr. V

416
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:43,040
know there's there's just too many good

417
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,819
resources from the blogosphere and from

418
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:49,429
forums and you know what I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

419
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:51,139
corked is not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you review the</font>

420
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:53,689
wines but then people can comment on

421
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:56,239
those reviews so like creating threaded

422
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:57,889
conversations around wines i think is

423
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:02,089
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm excited about the</font>

424
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:03,139
fact that i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think people have to</font>

425
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:06,610
spend $150 for a class or you know

426
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,100
necessarily buy a book now both are so

427
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,389
worthwhile classes there's that

428
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:13,939
engagement interaction books it's kind

429
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,129
of there with you can you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

430
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:17,899
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> still think there's nice romance about</font>

431
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:21,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">a book though I'm thrilled for Kindle or</font>

432
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:23,209
e-reader or whatever you know however

433
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:25,759
you why I pro knock yourself out it's

434
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,429
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the content but I think</font>

435
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:29,689
there's so much free content out there

436
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,420
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't necessarily need to sit</font>

437
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,679
here and recommend a source that's going

438
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:34,939
to hit somebody in the wallet save those

439
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:38,350
20 bones to buy a good bottle wine

440
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,590
yeah we were talking outside and you

441
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,150
know i was<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying you'd be shocked what</font>

442
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,270
happens between 15 and 25 the wine world

443
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,420
right now 25 to 40 bones you can drink

444
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">world-class stuff that you know you</font>

445
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,240
start getting into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shot of the pop</font>

446
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,790
world<font color="#CCCCCC"> priorat world you start getting</font>

447
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">into wine set you can't necessarily get</font>

448
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,590
to under 15 and they're really

449
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,180
sensational really I feel like the

450
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,890
quality of a wine given the depressed

451
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,829
market and given the advances in farming

452
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:08,970
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30-dollar wine today probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tasted</font>

453
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:12,000
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> good as most sixty to eighty dollar</font>

454
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,940
wines a decade ago that's powerful I

455
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:18,930
mean you know it's powerful it's a very

456
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">good direction for the wine drinker and</font>

457
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,950
I think it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious and so if I</font>

458
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">could say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything if you're into wine</font>

459
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,339
you know you start looking seriously at

460
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,170
25 to 40 bones you can get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy</font>

461
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,560
stuff

462
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:37,370
no you're gonna overpay that's all I got

463
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,870
nothing there I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean why do the month</font>

464
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,270
clubs are fine listen I created one for

<font color="#CCCCCC">gary vaynerchuk and Wine Library TV</font>

466
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,480
because I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create one that was</font>

legit I mean people getting ripped off<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

469
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,190
letter that says thank you you know so

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

471
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,590
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the best way to do that is</font>

472
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:04,340
to find sources that you respect and

473
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,990
Trust whether that's one number TV or

474
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,140
another blogger or local wine merchant

475
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,690
you know that that's the only way he's

476
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,490
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep you is by giving you great</font>

478
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,779
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> really do think we're going to see an</font>

479
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:19,400
explosion<font color="#E5E5E5"> and things like worked I mean</font>

480
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,630
that's why I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> so bullish on it and</font>

481
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,640
launching it now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think yelp has</font>

482
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,169
provided a platform that people

483
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,900
understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> community driven scoring</font>

484
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,970
has value and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's going to</font>

485
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,350
come to wine in a big way

486
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:35,869
I think Napa Valley you know hate being

487
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:38,690
so anti USA right I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Napa's</font>

488
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:41,960
massively overvalued I think I think

489
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,019
Priya rat in Spain is overpriced the

490
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:46,729
wines there tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into that sixty</font>

491
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:49,909
to eighty dollar range I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

492
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:51,769
there's parts of Bordeaux that are

493
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:53,649
overrated i think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left bank</font>

494
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:56,059
overshadowing the right bank meaning poo

501
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:17,629
I mean I like it but it's not insane so

<font color="#CCCCCC">Tuscans in Tuscany can get very</font>

505
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:26,450
overrated I mean so many of those wines

506
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,070
start at sixty seventy dollars a bottle

507
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,159
and I think that's insanity so you know

508
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:33,950
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there's a lot I think</font>

509
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,940
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot especially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when there's so</font>

510
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,009
many underrated places like the Provence

515
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:53,679
interesting

516
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,150
yellowtail gets blamed<font color="#E5E5E5"> for something</font>

517
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,880
that was happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> also with Robert</font>

519
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,780

520
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">that Robert Parker's the you know</font>

gorilla in the room very important wine

522
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,840
critic and he started reading a lot of

523
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">Australian wines that were under twenty</font>

again big scores under<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bucks and so</font>

528
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,430
consumers<font color="#CCCCCC"> started saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well I'm gonna</font>

529
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,340
spend 50 when I can spend 20 and I think

530
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,440
yellowtail came out at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time had</font>

531
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,970
this big marketing push became a huge

532
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:35,150
brand and create a scenario where people

533
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,820
blamed yellowtail for everybody thinking

534
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,710
Australia was a ten dollar price range

535
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,690
category so all the premium<font color="#E5E5E5"> Australian</font>

536
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:45,170
producers really got hurt in that period

537
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,700
but it was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the Parker</font>

538
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,920
scores and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the economy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was starting to</font>

539
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,230
soften and Spain and Portugal were

540
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,820
coming on strong with eight dollar wines

541
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,830
I think was a perfect storm that

542
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:59,590
yellowtail gets blamed for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know so</font>

543
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,180
young till is executed on something

544
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worked in the US which is</font>

545
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,450
good marketing and a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

546
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,370
sweetness you know they have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

547
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,530
bit more sugar levels and those Ozzie

548
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,260
whines then and so people like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

549
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,300
it's easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drink and kudos to them</font>

550
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,310
because they were very aggressively

551
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,350
marketing and they really got a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

552
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,000
support from some big retailers around a

553
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,800
country like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sam's and total wine I</font>

554
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,480
thought they played that very<font color="#CCCCCC"> smart</font>

555
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,340
there was a lot of smartness to what

556
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,720
Deutsch did there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and have a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

557
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,280
respect for the way they built<font color="#E5E5E5"> the brand</font>

558
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,260
I think the goodness proves that wine

559
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,580
can be cut you know you can still<font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

560
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,100
big brands and leveraging marketing and

561
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,340
pop culture<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the bad thing is is</font>

562
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,560
that you know people fall in love<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

563
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,720
in just drink that I'm not as mad about

564
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,460
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't feel bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the Australian</font>

565
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,840
business people they're the ones who

566
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,340
relied on Parker<font color="#E5E5E5"> in spectator never</font>

567
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,630
built a real business in the first place

568
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I'm not so worried about them I'm</font>

569
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,410
more worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the consumer that</font>

570
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,390
drinks a magnum of yellow tail shiraz

571
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,190
every night and I want them to try

572
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,520
different things

573
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:00,739
one thing Tony<font color="#CCCCCC"> Terlato did it you know</font>

574
00:22:00,739 --> 00:22:02,239
you brought<font color="#CCCCCC"> Corvo and Santa Margarita</font>

575
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,989
into this country<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a quite a feat</font>

576
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:08,269
kendall-jackson jess jackson was the

577
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:09,739
pipe in one of the first pioneers of

578
00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:11,029
building a real big brand what he did

579
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:15,559
with KJ is monumental you know but

580
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:17,509
there's not a lot of innovation on the

581
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:20,029
retail side on the producer side Pete

582
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:21,049
you know everybody ripped up their

583
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,849
plants to plant Pinot Noir it's a lot of

584
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:27,320
chasing and and not a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of innovating</font>

585
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,869
you know it's kind of it's kind of

586
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:31,700
shocking it's probably why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able to</font>

587
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,999
do so well<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that world not because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

588
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:36,950
was so good but more because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

589
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,399
competition

my mom and<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dad he'll punch me in the</font>

591
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:45,010
face if I did that in there my parents

592
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:49,150
by far but if you want me to break out

593
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,309
of that for a second i would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

594
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:53,650
I'm a storyteller I think my success is

595
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:54,580
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a great</font>

596
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,730
storyteller and in that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I build</font>

597
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,799
brands I tell stories to the to the

598
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:07,110
world to me Walt Disney Vince McMahon

599
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:11,860
and the notorious b.i.g are also great

600
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,179
storytellers that I respect

601
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,950
my dad told me very<font color="#E5E5E5"> early on your word</font>

602
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:25,049
is bond right he said he said you know

603
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:26,549
it came<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a good time is when I was</font>

604
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:28,679
into wu-tang clan too so I've heard it

605
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:30,809
and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hip-hop song so probably was</font>

606
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,490
a little more powerful to me but the

607
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,230
fact matter was my dad told me you make

608
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,580
a commitment i became<font color="#E5E5E5"> the buyer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

609
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,039
store<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 22 years old he said you make a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that is absolutely to this day the</font>

00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,860
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i'm doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

library TV I remember I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a</font>

624
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,970
Cabernet Franc episode and I wanted have

625
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,440
a Cabernet Franc from every part of the

626
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,440
world and we only had one<font color="#E5E5E5"> California</font>

627
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,779
four or five of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our California camp</font>

628
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:24,429
honks were out of stock and the only one

629
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:25,630
we had was from a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> friend of mine</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Shawn Larkin who let me sleep in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

we opened up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wines and he's always</font>

633
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,640
made great Cab Franc so I was very

634
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,590
confident going in that it wouldn't be

635
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,240
anything weird but they were never too

636
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,649
spectacular that I'd give it a hundred

637
00:24:38,649 --> 00:24:41,080
or anything right and I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it</font>

638
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I you know he could think really</font>

fast and even<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was only two seconds I</font>

642
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:54,760
to be sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I went on and pan the</font>

643
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,070
wine and he really got pissed you know

644
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,620
phone call f-bombs fight me after school

645
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,100
the whole nine you know so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a it</font>

646
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,570
was a very difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing it was</font>

647
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,960
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> crossroads because nobody</font>

648
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,360
knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'd stayed his house in 1996</font>

649
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,320
you know it's a long time ago and so it

650
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">was tough it was disappointing for me</font>

651
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,950
but you know what the best part is now

652
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,929
we're back right like he gets it so like

653
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:21,789
it's like it's cool you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I</font>

654
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:22,600
just think at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day you</font>

655
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,539
can't win in this new world by not being

one hundred percent transparent

657
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:32,470
your personal brand is your resume you

658
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,330
know if you think anybody's hiring off a

659
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,100
resume in three years you're out of your

660
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,640
God darn mind you know ninety<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent</font>

661
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,030
people I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google you first anyway no</font>

662
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:49,020
shot so yeah whether you like it or not

663
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,550
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> laughing at people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that don't</font>

664
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,890
think they're selling right you know the

666
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">the tech space that sometimes busts my</font>

667
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,880
chops that they're always selling to

668
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,320
they just don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> realize it they're not</font>

669
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">selling the way they think they're</font>

670
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,260
selling in a different way but they're

671
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,360
not you know and what push comes to

672
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,950
shove if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not selling you're going</font>

673
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,840
to go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of business and and they</font>

674
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">always sell out to the big corporations</font>

675
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you know you know this hierarchy of</font>

676
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,820
don't be a salesperson or don't promote

677
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,210
yourself you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i understand and being</font>

678
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,740
too much is definitely a bad thing and

679
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,840
i'm at bolt at that at times I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

680
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,630
but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you know excited and and I</font>

681
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,580
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's important to build a</font>

682
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,570
personal brand because it's the only

683
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,360
thing you're gonna have your reputation

684
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,060
online and in a new business world is

685
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,610
pretty much the game and so you got to

686
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,990
be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good person because you can't hide</font>

687
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,700
anything and more importantly you've got

688
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,830
to be out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some level I mean if</font>

you've ever left a comment on a blog or

<font color="#E5E5E5">can run away from you know being you</font>

703
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,290
know an introvert is not a negative you

00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,370
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to be obnoxious and</font>

705
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,770
over the top you can be yourself that's

706
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:24,340
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine but to be naive to the world</font>

we're moving towards where<font color="#E5E5E5"> informations</font>

at your fingertips and it's readily

709
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,320
available and everything you do is being

710
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,670
monitored you know you have a problem

711
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">with big brother you take that up with</font>

715
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,030
you're here

716
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,610
and you've got skates on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hockey</font>

00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,750
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand but the fact that</font>

721
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,180
matter is this you know we're living in

722
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:58,390
a very connected transparent everybody

723
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,580
knows your business world and I think

724
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to embrace that and harness it</font>

725
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,480
not run away from it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it's</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality the marketplace</font>

727
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,200
putting it out there right like you know

728
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,180
any junior level executives sit in

729
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,890
meetings and want to vomit all over the

730
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:16,230
place from what's being said and say oh

my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god the senior management or the CEO</font>

ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you to create a blog or to</font>

738
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:32,820
when I say that I'm not telling people

<font color="#E5E5E5">grab guns and go into post offices I'm</font>

740
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,540
just saying to you know this America

00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,140
right to you know speak your mind you

743
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,290
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I obviously we've got to be</font>

746
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,910
fired and you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go on an</font>

747
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,430
employment but you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">very smart of you know somebody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> writing</font>

749
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,380
I have an idea and just putting it out

750
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,790
there because once you put out your

751
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,570
smarts you've got a real shot and

752
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,920
vaynermedia charges you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> tons of</font>

753
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,530
money you know hefty hefty amount of

754
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,630
money a month consulting but I put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

755
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,010
of it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> for free on Gary Vaynerchuk</font>

756
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:10,890
calm the reason it works is because I

00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk in theory there and what I have a</font>

758
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,880
client we talk specifics and there's a

759
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of nuances and navigation through</font>

760
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,590
specifics and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of where</font>

761
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,920
that's at

762
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,470
I just want people to who are watching

00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,360
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know obviously I understand the</font>
