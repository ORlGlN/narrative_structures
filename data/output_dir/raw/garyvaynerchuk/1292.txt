1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,350
yeah the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> was if you're a</font>

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">developer how do you find business</font>

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,240
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help you that's funny</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">because I think businesspeople suck shit</font>

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,080
and are always<font color="#E5E5E5"> swarming after developers</font>

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,420
like you know like I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a lot</font>

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">easier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find that I think I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">I feels like there's so many of those</font>

9
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,609
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of characters running around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

10
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:19,710
think the better question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is once you</font>

11
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">put yourself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get that how</font>

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,880
do you filter<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get rid of 90% of</font>

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">their that are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Street full of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shit yeah</font>

14
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's a good point I thought I were you</font>

15
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,890
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go out and build it and launch it</font>

16
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then then try and at that point if</font>

17
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:32,308
you start getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> gaining traction</font>

18
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:33,870
you'll have you'll be swarmed by

19
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,460
business people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to work with</font>

20
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,410
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I also think the whole like</font>

21
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,870
I'm just shocked<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I'm big on the</font>

22
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,280
small town rules little Jetsons

23
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,800
Flintstones thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> honestly I would</font>

24
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,969
ask the<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 230 people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're the</font>

25
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:49,649
closest with and just start that process

26
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,020
I'm surprised how in this world where

27
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,670
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all friends and acquaintances</font>

28
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,710
I still think<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something as important</font>

29
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,420
when you go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with somebody</font>

30
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,210

31
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,320
deal than I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think people think</font>

32
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,049
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have success and so</font>

33
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,909
I would really spend a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of time</font>

34
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:07,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">vetting who you want to go into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

37
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:15,240
really really trust not a tweet<font color="#E5E5E5"> like who</font>

38
00:01:15,240 --> 00:00:00,000
wants a<font color="#E5E5E5"> team up</font>
