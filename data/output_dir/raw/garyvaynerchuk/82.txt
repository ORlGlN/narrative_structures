1
00:00:00,764 --> 00:00:02,921
- Easily one of my favorite
episodes of 'Daily Vee'

2
00:00:02,921 --> 00:00:04,813
this lunch got into some real insights,

3
00:00:04,813 --> 00:00:07,135
some different thinking, and some

4
00:00:07,135 --> 00:00:07,968
really powerful stuff here in Toronto.

5
00:00:07,968 --> 00:00:11,051
So I hope you enjoy today's Daily Vee

6
00:00:13,355 --> 00:00:16,772
(Alternative Rock Music)

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,184
- Oxygen to me, it's how everything works.

8
00:00:24,184 --> 00:00:25,696
You know, and if you do it great,

9
00:00:25,696 --> 00:00:29,592
you're getting people to do
things for the right reasons.

10
00:00:29,592 --> 00:00:31,252
You know and that's cool.

11
00:00:31,252 --> 00:00:34,612
Branding and propaganda
can get very close right?

12
00:00:34,612 --> 00:00:36,578
That's why I throw in
for the right reasons.

13
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,702
Because that's long term.

14
00:00:38,702 --> 00:00:41,825
But to me its not being
at the mercy of anybody.

15
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:43,895
I think what I like about my life is

16
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:45,410
I'm not at the mercy of anybody.

17
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,587
And a lot of that has to do with branding.

18
00:00:47,587 --> 00:00:49,212
And just my own, kind of like,

19
00:00:49,212 --> 00:00:51,955
lack of expectation of others.

20
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:55,646
Which makes it all upside, which is good.

21
00:00:55,646 --> 00:00:59,583
So I think to me that's
what's been so interesting

22
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,336
about the auto industry is,

23
00:01:01,336 --> 00:01:04,762
technology has stepped
right in the middle of

24
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:07,777
you and the end consumer
in a meaningful way.

25
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:09,626
And they have the leverage.

26
00:01:09,626 --> 00:01:13,051
The amount of referral business
that goes on in this world,

27
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:14,837
the amount of money, dealerships pay

28
00:01:14,837 --> 00:01:17,164
for referrals in one shape or form,

29
00:01:17,164 --> 00:01:19,914
is a bad macroeconomic structure.

30
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,651
- It's unbelievably expensive.

31
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:24,877
- Not only is it unbelievably expensive,

32
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:27,485
the referrers are being kind to you still.

33
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:29,735
They have all the leverage.

34
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,990
Apple one day decided, it was
30 percent vig on the app.

35
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,954
Right?

36
00:01:36,954 --> 00:01:39,439
You guys know what goes
on in the Apple world?

37
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,368
Like when you transact there,
Apple's vig is 30 percent.

38
00:01:43,368 --> 00:01:44,501
Do you know how crazy?

39
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:46,248
That's a big number.

40
00:01:46,248 --> 00:01:50,097
You know if one player
in the referral business

41
00:01:50,097 --> 00:01:53,463
decides to double the fee
because they can afford to,

42
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:55,048
they'll all be double

43
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,529
and you're going to do nothing about it.

44
00:01:58,529 --> 00:01:59,977
You have no leverage.

45
00:01:59,977 --> 00:02:02,780
Brand is the only thing
that can stop that.

46
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,982
Got it?

47
00:02:03,982 --> 00:02:08,149
Brand is the one thing that
goes from utility, to emotional.

48
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:11,866
- So I have a quick question

49
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:13,731
about what goes along with branding.

50
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:16,934
So our dealer group, we have 12 stores.

51
00:02:16,934 --> 00:02:20,698
Not all of them are named the
same, but our name is Pfaff

52
00:02:20,698 --> 00:02:22,549
and we're trying to brand the name Pfaff

53
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:24,215
and get the name out there.

54
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:26,857
But we have a Porsche
dealership, a McLaren dealership,

55
00:02:26,857 --> 00:02:28,689
some luxury high end dealerships,

56
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:31,005
what is more important to focus on?

57
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:32,764
The Porsche name, the McLaren name,

58
00:02:32,764 --> 00:02:34,355
or to keep branding as Pfaff.

59
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:35,188
- Pfaff

60
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,468
- And get the name out there.

61
00:02:36,468 --> 00:02:37,925
- It's not even close.

62
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:40,682
It's even a close debate.

63
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:42,784
- So that's what we've
on the path of doing.

64
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:46,230
- It's so much, it's so important,

65
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,728
that if that was my family business

66
00:02:47,728 --> 00:02:49,393
and I looked at the contracts,

67
00:02:49,393 --> 00:02:52,788
and there was a way for us to
fire somebody not doing it,

68
00:02:52,788 --> 00:02:54,868
and they were the biggest economic driver,

69
00:02:54,868 --> 00:02:56,480
I would spend all my life

70
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,328
convincing my dad we had to fire them.

71
00:02:58,328 --> 00:02:59,799
That's how much of a non debate it is.

72
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:00,949
- So should we switch all of the

73
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:03,480
new acquisitions that we've
got to the name Pfaff, as well?

74
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,248
- You should do whatever
you think is right Gene.

75
00:03:05,248 --> 00:03:06,591
But if I was part of the business,

76
00:03:06,591 --> 00:03:07,449
and I had say,

77
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:09,766
It'd be the only thing I care about.

78
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:12,211
It's the answer that I just
gave the gentleman there.

79
00:03:12,211 --> 00:03:16,378
It's the only, brother,
it's the only thing you got.

80
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:20,110
It's the only thing you have.

81
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:26,130
It doesn't feel like that, right?

82
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,033
That doesn't win the sprint,
Porsche wins the sprint.

83
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:32,033
Pfaff wins the marathon.

84
00:03:35,224 --> 00:03:37,629
- We were having the same conversation.

85
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:39,631
I actually, I'll admit
I said the opposite.

86
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:40,464
- I get it.

87
00:03:40,464 --> 00:03:41,297
- Right?

88
00:03:41,297 --> 00:03:44,109
It's because the end consumer
isn't the person buying so.

89
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:45,582
- You're right about that but

90
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:48,768
you're just not playing
out the chess of it all.

91
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:50,515
- Can you walk me through it?

92
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:51,357
- Sure.

93
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:52,666
In four years when
Porsche sends you an email

94
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,580
and says you've got 18
months and we're out.

95
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,100
You're going to be like fuck.

96
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,163
(Laughing)

97
00:04:00,163 --> 00:04:02,829
- You can still sell the oranges or

98
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:05,776
the lawn mowers, or
the pre-owned anything.

99
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:08,040
- But Jimmy, on that note
guys, I'm gonna say it.

100
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,708
I want to make sure you understand it.

101
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,179
Nintendo was a playing card company.

102
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:14,547
Nintendo started as a playing card company

103
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:17,297
I started off as a wine merchant.

104
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,591
Like, I get it.

105
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:22,223
But I actually usually
think the number one move

106
00:04:22,223 --> 00:04:24,934
when shit is interesting,

107
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:27,809
is to leverage while you've got it

108
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,350
the building of the other
thing with the assumption

109
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,587
that the first thing might
not even be there at all,

110
00:04:32,587 --> 00:04:35,337
and then taking it all as upside.

111
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:38,263
And then you can get smart right?

112
00:04:38,263 --> 00:04:40,407
The orange is kind of silly,

113
00:04:40,407 --> 00:04:43,152
lawn mowers a little bit closer.

114
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:45,731
But what about, why can't you guys start

115
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:49,580
the coolest air refreshment
thing in a car company

116
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,201
out of your little one stop?

117
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:53,842
Like why couldn't somebody here create

118
00:04:53,842 --> 00:04:57,675
the ten dollar premium
air refresher, why not?

119
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:00,750
You could.

120
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:02,965
And you'd have pretty much as

121
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:06,162
much permission to do it as anybody else.

122
00:05:06,162 --> 00:05:08,671
I'll go a different place with you.

123
00:05:08,671 --> 00:05:11,646
I think that BMW and Porsche and Mercedes

124
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:14,772
should be going into other sectors.

125
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,712
I'll go the reverse.

126
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:18,302
I think if I'm at Mercedes and I'm the CEO

127
00:05:18,302 --> 00:05:22,303
I would be creating an Alexa,
Google Home, Apple Homepod

128
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,193
competitor because I have
permission because of my brand,

129
00:05:25,193 --> 00:05:28,433
to be behind engineering
and high quality product.

130
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:32,358
Why should Braun be the
biggest razor in the world?

131
00:05:32,358 --> 00:05:34,358
I would buy BMW's razor.

132
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,760
So, you know, you gotta think about

133
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,173
where you have permission to hedge.

134
00:05:43,173 --> 00:05:44,786
- Some of these guys are
already doing stuff like that,

135
00:05:44,786 --> 00:05:46,996
like making bicycles and making this.

136
00:05:46,996 --> 00:05:48,708
- Makes sense, that's cool.

137
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:53,114
- You can buy anything that's
branded Harley Davidson.

138
00:05:53,114 --> 00:05:54,908
- Because Harley Davidson
really built a brand.

139
00:05:54,908 --> 00:05:57,799
Whoever was running, like I know nothing.

140
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,837
But like whoever was running that ship,

141
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:00,859
in probably that era.

142
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:01,878
They went all the way.

143
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:03,877
I actually think they went too far.

144
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:05,886
I think of Harley Davidson
similar to Playboy.

145
00:06:05,886 --> 00:06:07,429
I think sometimes you
whore out your name so much

146
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:09,319
that you dilute it so
you have to be careful.

147
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:11,057
- 60 percent of our sales
are in motor clothes,

148
00:06:11,057 --> 00:06:12,689
rather than actual physical motorcycles.

149
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:13,994
- Which by the way may be great.

150
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:15,657
You know it's funny
sometimes you look at margin,

151
00:06:15,657 --> 00:06:16,930
you know my dad's business,

152
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,526
I'm trying to convert Wine Library,

153
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:19,963
It's called Wine Library.

154
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,995
I'm trying to get my dad to
basically become a food store.

155
00:06:22,995 --> 00:06:24,682
You know I'm not a scholar.

156
00:06:24,682 --> 00:06:27,017
I didn't go to Yale, and
did a couple studies,

157
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:29,246
and am a good public
speaker and wrote a book,

158
00:06:29,246 --> 00:06:30,908
and we're having this conversation.

159
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:32,301
I do what you do.

160
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:33,259
There's never been a day,

161
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,860
The day I left college
at 22 I drove from Boston

162
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,723
to New York, to New Jersey, to home.

163
00:06:38,723 --> 00:06:42,723
I got there at 4:18 and
worked from 4:18 to 7:30

164
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:45,797
before me and my dad went home.

165
00:06:45,797 --> 00:06:48,753
This is the day I left college.

166
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:51,678
From that moment on to the
second I'm sitting here

167
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:55,142
right now, I have never
not operated as a CEO,

168
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:57,473
of business in my life.

169
00:06:57,473 --> 00:06:59,820
Even in transition between Wine Library

170
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,212
and the building of Gary Vee,
I was the CEO of Vayner Media.

171
00:07:03,212 --> 00:07:05,361
Yes I was a little more
passive than AJ was.

172
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:07,560
But it wouldn't be there without me.

173
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,967
I don't say this stuff in theory.

174
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,492
This is not theory for me.

175
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:14,571
This is not intellectual.

176
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:17,301
This is practical reality.

177
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:20,950
I think the way I communicate
it feels hyperbolized,

178
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,805
because I'm a showmen.

179
00:07:22,805 --> 00:07:24,458
But now I'm in an interesting
part in my career,

180
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,156
because now I have some history behind me

181
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:27,831
that makes it a little,
it's a little harder

182
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:30,487
to completely laugh me
off the state, you know?

183
00:07:30,487 --> 00:07:33,636
Because you keep winning
that much, it's hard.

184
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:35,526
That's why I built Vayner Media.

185
00:07:35,526 --> 00:07:37,020
Madison Avenue, tough
place, big companies,

186
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,761
holding companies,
billion dollar companies,

187
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:40,091
he's just a Twitter kid.

188
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:42,237
The articles are on the internet.

189
00:07:42,237 --> 00:07:44,397
Twitter boy thinks he
can win Madison Avenue.

190
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,192
This fuckin' kid, they didn't say that.

191
00:07:46,192 --> 00:07:49,750
This guy thinks, that's
what they wanted to say.

192
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,740
This guy thinks he's a big shot.

193
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,637
It's a lot harder to build
a Madison Avenue agency

194
00:07:53,637 --> 00:07:56,092
is than to get some Twitter followers.

195
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:58,458
Vayner Media is the fastest
growing organic top line

196
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:02,059
revenue agency in the
history of the business.

197
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:05,275
Seven years, 150 million dollars, no M&A,

198
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:07,775
all organic, no cash infusion.

199
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,552
That doesn't happen
because I'm charismatic.

200
00:08:12,552 --> 00:08:15,135
That happens because I operate.

201
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,848
- So how do you handle work life balance?

202
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:21,181
- Communication.

203
00:08:22,206 --> 00:08:23,373
- Good Answer.

204
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:26,086
- Communication.

205
00:08:26,086 --> 00:08:28,530
- I always think what my
wife would've said to that.

206
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,865
- Day trading communication.

207
00:08:30,865 --> 00:08:34,592
If my wife texts me right now
and she's like "fuck this"

208
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:36,178
I won't go to Chicago right now,

209
00:08:36,178 --> 00:08:39,890
I'll fly home, and I'll
talk til it's not fuck this.

210
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,688
Now a lot of it was back
to making good strategies.

211
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,921
Like I at a young age knew
who I needed to marry.

212
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:47,502
I didn't know it.

213
00:08:47,502 --> 00:08:49,656
You know us guys, and
we're mainly guys here.

214
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:50,489
When you're younger you're like

215
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,592
you want your girl to
be obsessed with you.

216
00:08:52,592 --> 00:08:54,856
I didn't realize how desperately I needed

217
00:08:54,856 --> 00:08:56,319
to marry somebody who
was super independent.

218
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,635
And had her own shit, you know?

219
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:00,966
That's funny to me in
hindsight of the teenage me

220
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:02,780
would've never thought that right?

221
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,143
So my wife's super her own person,

222
00:09:05,143 --> 00:09:07,151
and she's a stay at home mom.

223
00:09:07,151 --> 00:09:10,070
But from a framework she doesn't
need me you know kind of.

224
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,493
Which is interesting.

225
00:09:11,493 --> 00:09:13,222
And then in extremism.

226
00:09:13,222 --> 00:09:16,305
So Monday through Friday
when I'm on the field,

227
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,127
it's seven am to Midnight.

228
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:21,773
And then on the weekends I'm
completely checked out at home,

229
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:24,021
and I take seven full weeks of vacation,

230
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,938
completely checked out.

231
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:28,567
And that's it, extremism.

232
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,738
Something that won't work for most.

233
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:31,571
You know, you don't know what's going on

234
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,589
in somebodies bedroom right?

235
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:36,580
I'll give you another answer.

236
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,832
Maybe even more important
that communication.

237
00:09:39,832 --> 00:09:41,337
I'm just not interested
in your guys opinion

238
00:09:41,337 --> 00:09:43,244
on my parenting style.

239
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:45,265
Too many people are pandering

240
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:48,044
to the current state of political
correctness of parenting.

241
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:49,542
- Everyone has their own way.

242
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:53,908
- That's right, and I'm
apathetic to it I get it.

243
00:09:53,908 --> 00:09:56,411
But I actually, I actually
am on the record of this,

244
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:59,248
I do believe this co-parenting concept

245
00:09:59,248 --> 00:10:02,947
will be looked upon in 100
years from now as wrong.

246
00:10:02,947 --> 00:10:05,257
I do not believe in
two cooks in a kitchen.

247
00:10:05,257 --> 00:10:08,368
There's no such thing as co CEO's.

248
00:10:08,368 --> 00:10:10,503
- So you leave everything
for her to decide?

249
00:10:10,503 --> 00:10:13,003
- Or him, I think in 70 years,

250
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:18,925
I think we all know couples where

251
00:10:21,103 --> 00:10:22,830
when you look at their DNA,

252
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,458
the women or the man should be at work,

253
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,604
the women or the man should be at home.

254
00:10:26,604 --> 00:10:29,087
So I think we went through
women at home, man.

255
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,143
Now we're living through another,

256
00:10:31,143 --> 00:10:32,871
starting to get into a co-parenting thing.

257
00:10:32,871 --> 00:10:34,886
And we'll do this for another 20-30 years.

258
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:38,647
I think our kids, and probably
more likely our grandkids,

259
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:40,905
are gonna be really smart
and audit with each other

260
00:10:40,905 --> 00:10:41,928
and be like.

261
00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:44,816
You have a higher capacity to earn,

262
00:10:44,816 --> 00:10:47,690
I have a higher capacity to nurture.

263
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,575
And then let's go because
boy I know ten couples

264
00:10:51,575 --> 00:10:54,496
where the woman's at home
and she's 50 fucking times

265
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:56,388
more capable than the guy.

266
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:58,784
And I know equally as many couples

267
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,769
where she's a disaster
and not nurturing at all

268
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:04,618
and he's the most lovely
thing of all time.

269
00:11:04,618 --> 00:11:08,227
I think that's going to be
the future of parenting.

270
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:09,668
I think so.

271
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:11,585
I think it's practical.

272
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:14,879
Bon Apetit

273
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,588
- What's your biggest miss?

274
00:11:16,588 --> 00:11:19,042
- My biggest miss is definitely the things

275
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:20,182
that I haven't done.

276
00:11:20,182 --> 00:11:22,205
So I don't know them in detail.

277
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:24,001
Because that's my biggest issue.

278
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:26,501
Cripple by opportunity, right?

279
00:11:27,944 --> 00:11:31,079
The biggest misses black and white are,

280
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,002
I was super right about YouTube,
a company called Viddler

281
00:11:34,002 --> 00:11:36,474
came along, and gave me seven
percent of their company

282
00:11:36,474 --> 00:11:38,913
to move my Wine Library show to Viddler.

283
00:11:38,913 --> 00:11:40,563
And I stopped producing
for YouTube up until

284
00:11:40,563 --> 00:11:42,152
a year and a half ago.

285
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:43,818
And I left ungodly amounts of branding

286
00:11:43,818 --> 00:11:46,265
on the table over the last decade.

287
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:49,461
I passed on Uber's angel round twice.

288
00:11:49,461 --> 00:11:51,802
If you guys go take outta
the library Crush It,

289
00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:52,635
my first book.

290
00:11:52,635 --> 00:11:55,052
I had only acknowledged one
person in my acknowledgements

291
00:11:55,052 --> 00:11:57,166
besides my parents, my family.

292
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,406
And that's Travis the CEO of Uber.

293
00:11:59,406 --> 00:12:01,224
Because he's a dear friend of mine and

294
00:12:01,224 --> 00:12:03,818
I passed on a friend
of mines company twice

295
00:12:03,818 --> 00:12:06,107
and it ended up being Uber.

296
00:12:06,107 --> 00:12:09,526
So that's pretty black and white.

297
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:13,327
I didn't answer the email
that reads like this.

298
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:14,771
Hey Garry Vee we're huge fans we

299
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:17,015
desperately want you to
invest in our company

300
00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:18,239
we'd love to have a meeting.

301
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:19,873
Didn't even reply to the email.

302
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,706
That came from AirBnB.

303
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:27,252
I was so right that I
have such real losses.

304
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:29,295
You know because you
couldn't get them all, right?

305
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:32,970
I don't have the losses
that most people have,

306
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,240
Because I have never done anything

307
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,296
financially that could hurt me really bad.

308
00:12:37,296 --> 00:12:40,970
I'm stunned by people's
ability to do things

309
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,640
that can put you out of business.

310
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,973
Like overextending yourself.

311
00:12:48,354 --> 00:12:49,757
I don't do that.

312
00:12:49,757 --> 00:12:52,363
Now I'm not, if I don't have
the cash I don't do that.

313
00:12:52,363 --> 00:12:53,600
I'm willing to borrow.

314
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,183
I mean I got a lease at Hudson Yards

315
00:12:55,183 --> 00:12:56,570
that scares the shit outta me.

316
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,403
Right?

317
00:12:57,403 --> 00:12:59,332
But those are a little more calculated.

318
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:02,393
One of the biggest reasons
I built my personal brand,

319
00:13:02,393 --> 00:13:06,304
is I used Gary Vee as an
insurance policy for my life.

320
00:13:06,304 --> 00:13:09,490
Like if all else fails, I can
make 20 million dollars a year

321
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,040
speaking and writing books.

322
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,705
That's the most ridiculous thing

323
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:14,825
I've ever said in my life, but it's true.

324
00:13:14,825 --> 00:13:16,242
And it's awesome.

325
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:22,691
So I think I did that, but
I also did it for branding.

326
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:24,908
Vayner Media doesn't pick RFP's.

327
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:28,722
Last week. Five of the
biggest 500 businesses

328
00:13:28,722 --> 00:13:32,282
in the world and said will
you take our business.

329
00:13:32,282 --> 00:13:35,474
That's called brand you know?

330
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:37,524
So, we don't have a sales team.

331
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:40,613
We don't have a head of new business.

332
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:43,134
And we're the fastest growing,

333
00:13:43,134 --> 00:13:44,675
let the market come to you.

334
00:13:44,675 --> 00:13:48,342
The person that asks,
gives up the leverage.

335
00:13:49,826 --> 00:13:50,659
Sales.

336
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:51,860
That's why it's hard.

337
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,199
They way I knew the internet
was going to be big,

338
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,065
the way I knew e-commerce, the way email,

339
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:59,428
and Google AdWords, I was
building, by not being educated,

340
00:13:59,428 --> 00:14:00,734
by not knowing rich people,

341
00:14:00,734 --> 00:14:03,050
I came from like a very funny place.

342
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,501
I didn't know a lot of stuff.

343
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:07,456
I didn't even know
venture capital existed.

344
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:10,089
So I'm like wait a minute.

345
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:12,417
This is interesting

346
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:15,139
I'm good at things,
like this is not a joke.

347
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:17,521
I'm like I understand,
I'm not a good salesman.

348
00:14:17,521 --> 00:14:22,037
I'm not a good wine
merchant, I'm good at things.

349
00:14:22,037 --> 00:14:24,116
So I started reading
everything about YouTube

350
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:25,354
selling for two billion dollars.

351
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:26,281
And I don't know if you guys remember

352
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:27,604
when YouTube sold for two billion.

353
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:29,189
It was one point seven.

354
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:32,243
It was in 2007 or 2008,
I don't remember exactly.

355
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:34,957
But if you remember, that was like a

356
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,000
trillion dollars at the time.

357
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,833
Remember?

358
00:14:39,942 --> 00:14:42,609
Good, I'm glad you guys remember

359
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,716
That was like, a trillion.

360
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,634
A trillion's a lot.

361
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:51,937
If I woke up this morning and
Snapchat sold for a trillion.

362
00:14:51,937 --> 00:14:53,655
I'd be like whoa that's a lot.

363
00:14:53,655 --> 00:14:55,617
So it hit me that hard and it

364
00:14:55,617 --> 00:14:57,503
was something that I understood

365
00:14:57,503 --> 00:15:00,536
as one of the first 50,000
people to understand.

366
00:15:00,536 --> 00:15:03,105
So I'm like there's something in that.

367
00:15:03,105 --> 00:15:06,869
In that digging I read
about angel investors.

368
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:09,166
Then I Googled angel investor.

369
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,871
This is why I always give this advice.

370
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,351
And I'm like oh you can
invest in companies?

371
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,256
I'm being serious with you.

372
00:15:17,256 --> 00:15:19,029
There's certain things I'm good at,

373
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:20,948
there's certain things I'm not.

374
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:23,660
Before they go on the stock market?

375
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,219
Then I started really getting into tech.

376
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:27,818
And I was like this is
going to eat the world.

377
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,145
That's when I basically,
binarily over night,

378
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:31,816
decided everything that's happening

379
00:15:31,816 --> 00:15:34,489
now will basically eat up everything.

380
00:15:34,489 --> 00:15:35,406
Everything.

381
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,644
And so I started really learning,

382
00:15:39,644 --> 00:15:42,807
I started reading tech crunch every day.

383
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:46,390
And then I went to
South By Southwest 2007.

384
00:15:47,671 --> 00:15:51,643
And at that South By Southwest
2008 Twitter was exploding.

385
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:55,242
And everyone was shitting
on it, even the tech kids.

386
00:15:55,242 --> 00:15:56,838
They're like who cares if you..

387
00:15:56,838 --> 00:15:59,329
Because it was psychology
it wasn't utility.

388
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:02,234
Everybody was like who
cares, you know you'd have

389
00:16:02,234 --> 00:16:05,282
real tech people, the people
that now you all know.

390
00:16:05,282 --> 00:16:06,738
Like very famous and
then some that you don't.

391
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:09,395
But they'd sit here and
I'd be at the BBQ pit,

392
00:16:09,395 --> 00:16:10,761
because I'm listening right?

393
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,606
For all my talking, and I'm
doing a lot of it today,

394
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:14,499
I listen all the time.

395
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:16,298
And I'm listening, and they're like

396
00:16:16,298 --> 00:16:19,889
who gives a shit if you
walk the dog this is stupid.

397
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:22,490
Nobody's gonna care that
you're eating pizza.

398
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,612
And I'm sitting there and I'm
like everybody's gonna care.

399
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:27,331
I'm like that's what we do.

400
00:16:27,331 --> 00:16:28,998
That's what life is.

401
00:16:30,152 --> 00:16:31,794
We don't want to admit it.

402
00:16:31,794 --> 00:16:33,154
So that's what I'm good at.

403
00:16:33,154 --> 00:16:33,987
Right?

404
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:36,300
I knew that everybody was
gonna put their credit card

405
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,467
into a computer when everybody
told me they wouldn't.

406
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,022
Every one of you is gonna
retna scan everything.

407
00:16:48,022 --> 00:16:49,987
Because it's going to save you time.

408
00:16:49,987 --> 00:16:53,513
I knew that everybody
was gonna online date

409
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,082
when everybody thought it was

410
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:57,488
the weirdest shit ever in 2000.

411
00:16:57,488 --> 00:16:59,683
It's just time arbitrage.

412
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:02,348
It will be the thing
we trade on every time.

413
00:17:02,348 --> 00:17:04,615
I get an email from Dave
Moren the head of Platform,

414
00:17:04,615 --> 00:17:06,845
it says, Mark would love for you to come

415
00:17:06,845 --> 00:17:09,608
and speak to the company
about why you believe this.

416
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:11,832
I said, I'll be there tomorrow.

417
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:13,513
I flew out to Palo Alto.

418
00:17:13,513 --> 00:17:14,416
I spoke in front of the company

419
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,348
when it was the size of
this conference I just gave.

420
00:17:17,348 --> 00:17:19,838
I only spoke about consumer behavior.

421
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,512
Because at that point there
was something weird about

422
00:17:22,512 --> 00:17:24,839
Facebook that they really were doing

423
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,672
what I would do if I knew how to do that.

424
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:28,881
So I went weird.

425
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,425
It was I had ever spoken.

426
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,617
I didn't even know how to articulate it.

427
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:33,450
Right?

428
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,113
I didn't know Mark was there.

429
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:39,221
He sat all the way in the back, slouched.

430
00:17:39,221 --> 00:17:41,600
Came down, goes do you want
to have dinner tonight?

431
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,841
I said, I sure do.

432
00:17:43,841 --> 00:17:45,136
We had dinner.

433
00:17:45,136 --> 00:17:47,574
He was one of the only people
I've ever met in my life

434
00:17:47,574 --> 00:17:50,475
that I've thought had the
same intuitive understanding

435
00:17:50,475 --> 00:17:52,194
about people as I do.

436
00:17:52,194 --> 00:17:54,656
Which is super funny to me
because the way he's portrayed

437
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,958
in the movie is super, like
he's so not introverted.

438
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,245
He's introverted in some ways.

439
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,662
But in a macro he's all time.

440
00:18:04,076 --> 00:18:06,493
We became friendly, he would
come to New York a bunch

441
00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:08,145
and I would see him.

442
00:18:08,145 --> 00:18:09,639
Which are going to be
great stories one day

443
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:11,095
to tell my grandkids.

444
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:13,742
And one day his sister called me, Randy

445
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:17,409
And said, "Our parents,
Mark and I's parents

446
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:21,338
want to sell a bunch
of stock to buy a house

447
00:18:21,338 --> 00:18:23,146
and we'd really like you
to be part of the family.

448
00:18:23,146 --> 00:18:25,553
Would you like to buy some stock?"

449
00:18:25,553 --> 00:18:27,949
And I said, "I sure do."

450
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:29,540
I was in the back of taxi in Miami.

451
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,044
I will never forget that
moment my whole life.

452
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:33,430
I put in every dollar I
had in my bank account

453
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,321
except for 100,000 dollars,

454
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:38,306
and I have not sold one share since.

455
00:18:38,306 --> 00:18:40,126
Thank you, thanks for having me.

456
00:18:40,126 --> 00:18:41,400
It was really nice meeting you guys.

457
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,285
Have a good day take care. Bye.

458
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:45,262
