1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,624
- You guys are looking for Gary V

00:00:01,624 --> 00:00:03,123

00:00:03,123 --> 00:00:03,956

4
00:00:03,956 --> 00:00:04,789
(laughter)

5
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:06,282
- General admission right
here VIP over there.

6
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:07,813
We're not lettin' people in yet.

7
00:00:07,813 --> 00:00:08,646
- This is Gary V.

8
00:00:08,646 --> 00:00:09,479
- I am Gary V.

9
00:00:09,479 --> 00:00:11,729
(laughter)

10
00:00:12,607 --> 00:00:13,679
How you doin"?

11
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,361
- As good as I been vlog,

12
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:18,631
fuckin' sunshine in
Los Angeles, real good.

13
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:19,978
Iris, where are you?

14
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,042
It's unbelievable, we'd
much rather eat soil

15
00:00:22,042 --> 00:00:23,627
than smell roses.

16
00:00:23,627 --> 00:00:25,007
That's why we have so many roses.

17
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:26,061
- Thanks man.

18
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:27,284
- Take care of yourself.

19
00:00:27,284 --> 00:00:28,518
- You're so inspiring bro,

20
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:29,628
- Thank you very much.
- Swear to God.

21
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:30,986
- You're the most inspirational guy.

22
00:00:30,986 --> 00:00:32,292
- Congratulations
- Thank you

23
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:34,109
- We're in complex times.
- Rappers?

24
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:35,757
- These are just good human beings.

25
00:00:35,757 --> 00:00:38,573
Ferg overslept, so now I
gotta go on 11:15 solo.

26
00:00:38,573 --> 00:00:42,934
When impact is your
motivation you could be calm.

27
00:00:42,934 --> 00:00:45,715
I like the people waitin' in
line tryin' to make that money.

28
00:00:45,715 --> 00:00:46,828
You know what this reminds me of?

29
00:00:46,828 --> 00:00:48,544
It's baseball card
shows, that's all it is.

30
00:00:48,544 --> 00:00:51,102
It's just patience man.

31
00:00:51,102 --> 00:00:53,764
Fuckin' hard ass work,
listening to absolutely nobody

32
00:00:53,764 --> 00:00:55,878
and everybody wants to listen
to other people's opinions

33
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:58,133
it's all fuckin' mistakes.

34
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:00,201
You have one big thing they don't have.

35
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:01,850
If one fuckin' persons in there.

36
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,035
I am going to fuckin' bring
it as hard as I fuckin' can.

37
00:01:04,035 --> 00:01:06,889
This is a serious fuckin'
event, that people are going to

38
00:01:06,889 --> 00:01:08,684
realize really matters.

39
00:01:08,684 --> 00:01:10,642
- I'm 19 years old, I
fuckin' hate college.

40
00:01:10,642 --> 00:01:11,730
I fuckin' hate school.

41
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,102
- So fuckin' call their
bluff, work at Burger King,

42
00:01:14,102 --> 00:01:15,267
live with nine for...

43
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:16,645
Life's about options bro.

44
00:01:16,645 --> 00:01:19,184
Dude I was makin' 34 thousand
dollars a year at 26.

45
00:01:19,184 --> 00:01:21,021
You're not gonna fuckin' make me sob.

46
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:23,089
This guy, this is his natural talent,

47
00:01:23,089 --> 00:01:25,090
this is natural talent.

48
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,415
For all the rest of us,
we've got to fucking grind,

49
00:01:27,415 --> 00:01:28,755
we're not all blessed.

50
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,206
I am dropping my fucking
case with class...

51
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:32,172
Before you.

52
00:01:32,172 --> 00:01:34,178
I was too scared that you
were going to get it first.

53
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:36,562
He was just makin' business
decisions, if you can't

54
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:38,562
afford fuckin' future,
you can't afford future.

55
00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:42,028
No! This is the sweeper window,
get to the sweeper window.

56
00:01:42,028 --> 00:01:43,303
(cheers)

57
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,399
- How do I get the confidence
to get back on the horse?

58
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:46,749
- There's no fuckin' choice.

59
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:48,515
You've gotta do what
the fuck you wanna do.

60
00:01:48,515 --> 00:01:50,907
99% of influencers go for
the cash, never waiver.

61
00:01:50,907 --> 00:01:52,589
Almost everybody wants it faster.

62
00:01:52,589 --> 00:01:55,352
Most of the people here
aren't where they're at

63
00:01:55,352 --> 00:01:58,023
because they did actions
that were predicated

64
00:01:58,023 --> 00:01:59,225
on lack of patience.

65
00:01:59,225 --> 00:02:01,099
Hot Ones community, I love you.

66
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:03,349
Even the 7,000 of you
that said I am the worst

67
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:05,538
piece of shit, that's
why I replied to you,

68
00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:07,014
because I got love for you.

69
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:09,265
Dude, can you throw that
phone on the ground?

70
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:10,198
Take a photo.

71
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,277
Could you ever imagine what
you and I do for a living,

72
00:02:12,277 --> 00:02:13,474
being an entrepreneur?

73
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:15,497
We cross over to what
he does for a living.

74
00:02:15,497 --> 00:02:16,862
You're not stopping.

75
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:19,416
- I want what you got -
you stop when you die, man.

76
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,135
- I learn a whole lot from you,
I pastor a church in Miami.

77
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:23,287
Thank you sir, I appreciate you.

78
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:24,310
- I appreciate the love, man.

79
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,323
Hey, keep doing your thing.

80
00:02:25,323 --> 00:02:26,448
"Post production".

81
00:02:26,448 --> 00:02:28,988
I don't like dialing back, the
question is, do you have to?

82
00:02:28,988 --> 00:02:31,388
The quickest way to never
buy the Porsche company

83
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:33,298
is to buy a Porche.

84
00:02:33,298 --> 00:02:34,131
'Sup my man?

85
00:02:34,131 --> 00:02:35,066
- How are you man?

86
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:36,098
- Keep doing your thing, man.

87
00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:36,931
- Thank you bro.

88
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:38,005
- It's fun to watch.

89
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:38,921
- I appreciate that!
- Such good vibes.

90
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:40,584
- I'm so glad I'm fun to watch
- How are you?

91
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:43,113
It's my sweeper, my first
entrepreneur collaboration.

92
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:44,108
- That's so cool!

93
00:02:44,108 --> 00:02:46,802
- Man's eatin' popcorn like a boss!

94
00:02:46,802 --> 00:02:48,763
Never do something for somebody else.

95
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:50,993
Be you period, end of story.

96
00:02:50,993 --> 00:02:52,218
- Why?

97
00:02:52,218 --> 00:02:54,202
- Because you will be more
hungry to make it the next year.

98
00:02:54,202 --> 00:02:57,490
- Oh my God, I am.
- Patience, my man,

99
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,390
- Hey Rock, get this
guy's info for this whole

100
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,912
"Global thing I've got" idea.

101
00:03:00,912 --> 00:03:02,885
It's just all so good, like
what the fuck do we have

102
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:03,718
to complain about?

103
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:04,733
The wine guys are here.

104
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:05,566
(laughter)

105
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:07,345
Look at these guys.

106
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:08,550
- I made this for you Gary.

107
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,446
It's a piece I call The Good Challenge.

108
00:03:10,446 --> 00:03:12,221
- I'm a big fan of your shit.

109
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:14,351
The champion right here, you don't know.

110
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:16,268
Get on who this man is.

111
00:03:17,726 --> 00:03:19,795
This is fuckin' legit, thank you brother.

112
00:03:19,795 --> 00:03:22,468
We need to exercise tomorrow.

113
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,692
Everybody here's making
bad decisions always.

114
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:26,692
That's gonna kill, kill!

115
00:03:28,065 --> 00:03:28,996
- How you doin'?

116
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:30,074
- Good to see you.

117
00:03:30,074 --> 00:03:30,907
- Shawn

118
00:03:30,907 --> 00:03:32,665
- Everybody walkin' around
here that's never been punched

119
00:03:32,665 --> 00:03:34,447
in the face, they're still vulnerable.

120
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,358
Imagine that shit happened to you at 37?

121
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:40,724
Eric Moose, he's my
favorite from everybody.

122
00:03:40,724 --> 00:03:41,974
- 301 for life.

123
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:47,108
- Yo, upgrade your fuckin' software.

124
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:48,971
In the fuckin' dome, not your phone.

125
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:50,492
- Not your fuckin' phone baby.

126
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:52,341
- Get it, one life.

127
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:54,602
- By showin' patience, remember
I'm going to fuckin' die,

128
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:56,728
practicality, all that
shit, happenin' right now.

129
00:03:56,728 --> 00:03:59,619
- Yes! If you're willing to bleed.

130
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:01,471
If you're willing to be humble.

131
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:02,368
Work!

132
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:03,767
Reboot your operating system,

133
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:05,440
it's in the dome not the phone.

134
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,118
You either have money or you have time.

135
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:09,950
Everybody's fancy and
doesn't want to fuckin' be

136
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,959
at a hundred people.

137
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,042
Is it 5:30? Second floor?

138
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:15,074
The Studio

139
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:17,742
5:30 The Complex Studio, it's goin' down.

140
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:21,762
The Q and A session, come see
me if you are at Complex Con.

141
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:25,688
All that WWF wrestling promotion
shit watchin' came through.

142
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:27,974
I'll tell you right now, there's
not one fuckin' group here

143
00:04:27,974 --> 00:04:29,584
that had the right concept.

144
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:33,325
They just kept iterating what
they did, they did, they did.

145
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:35,297
- That guy right there is
a fuckin' genius everybody.

146
00:04:35,297 --> 00:04:37,785
- Thank you brother. Thank you.

147
00:04:37,785 --> 00:04:41,657
Big Crit, this guy's new
project, do not sleep on this.

148
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:43,435
- Don't sleep, you heard it from Gary V.

149
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:44,708
- How you doin'?
- I love you.

150
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:45,997
- I love you too.

151
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:47,936
- It's all the same shit,
self awareness, what are you

152
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:50,863
good at, patience, gratitude, hard work.

153
00:04:50,863 --> 00:04:54,978
It's just beginning, you're
not even in the parking lot yet

154
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:56,830
to the fuckin' game,
to the national anthem.

155
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,840
Like, you've just started.

156
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,901
- I'm eatin' lunch with
the scalpers outside.

157
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:01,391
(laughter)

158
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:03,502
- I'm telling you, just pick one.

159
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:06,722
Just pick one, you're not
gonna know how it would've

160
00:05:06,722 --> 00:05:07,874
worked out anyway.

161
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,249
Stop bullshitting and
start doin' somethin'.

162
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:11,744
I'll get you fuckin' mental fit,

163
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,962
because you've got one fuckin'
life, stop bullshittin' it.

164
00:05:14,962 --> 00:05:16,704
I might be in Atlanta the
day after Thanksgiving.

165
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:19,107
You'll never regret
fuckin' making that punch.

166
00:05:19,107 --> 00:05:21,914
So much progress for both of us.

167
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:23,148
Not even a year.

168
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:23,981
- You're unbelievable.

169
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:26,977
- Vlog, thank you Barney,
you're unbelievable

170
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:29,835
for seeing it for reaching out.

171
00:05:29,835 --> 00:05:32,103
- What's your goal for 2018?

172
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:34,017
- I just want to be better
than I was the year before,

173
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:37,912
as a person, as an executor,
as an entrepreneur,

174
00:05:37,912 --> 00:05:40,719
as a personality, as a dad, just better.

175
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:42,317
- Tell the people they're gonna die?

176
00:05:42,317 --> 00:05:43,680
- Oh, I know they're gonna die,

177
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,328
it's what they're gonna do about it.

178
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:46,429
Do something.

179
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:50,371
You can't make up a narrative,
either you played Spades

180
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:51,925
and Cielo or you didn't.

181
00:05:51,925 --> 00:05:54,834
Either you lived in the
environment we lived in

182
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:55,759
or you didn't.

183
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,787
It was like my Puff Daddy.

184
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:58,326
The mmms are comin' in.

185
00:05:58,326 --> 00:05:59,887
I was about to sit down
because mmms are like,

186
00:05:59,887 --> 00:06:02,506
oh shit, I better say
something else fuckin' fresh.

187
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:05,603
I haven't even talked about
mmms before I sit the fuck down.

188
00:06:05,603 --> 00:06:06,998
I better come over a little more fresh.

189
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:09,975
Nobody is giving a fuck about
a supreme backpack when your

190
00:06:09,975 --> 00:06:10,941
health isn't goin' anywhere.

191
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:12,916
Thank you guys so much, I
have nothin' but love for you.

192
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,166
(cheering)

193
00:06:17,097 --> 00:06:20,430
Uh oh, look at this Vlog, double fisted.

194
00:06:22,928 --> 00:06:24,879
Double fisted on the Vlog.

195
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,426
Good day guys today.

196
00:06:26,426 --> 00:06:27,596
Pretty good, right?

197
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,712
We hacked a little culture, today.

198
00:06:30,712 --> 00:06:32,781
I was in a different head-space in there.

199
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:36,161
- It was great when you said
all the nine to 11 entrepeneurs

200
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:37,028
- All the hat?

201
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:37,861
- All the nine to 11...

202
00:06:37,861 --> 00:06:39,263
(laughter)

203
00:06:39,263 --> 00:06:41,263
(music)

204
00:06:49,169 --> 00:00:00,000
- That was some good content.
