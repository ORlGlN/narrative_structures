1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,907
- Going in to a big client meeting.

2
00:00:01,907 --> 00:00:02,740
See how it goes.

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,719
Did we get anything today?

4
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:07,302
(bouncy, electronic music)

5
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,586
You know I'm gonna throw you
a little bit of a curve ball.

6
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:15,008
First of all, that's 100% right.

7
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:17,145
I made enough dollars

8
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:19,557
a long time ago and I don't
mean some of the cool stuff,

9
00:00:19,557 --> 00:00:22,417
I mean, when I made $100,000 a year

10
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:23,899
I literally thought I'd made it.

11
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:24,732
- [Man] Sure.

12
00:00:24,732 --> 00:00:27,739
- You know in the micro with
all my crazy Jets ambition.

13
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,953
I can tell you right now and I mean this,

14
00:00:29,953 --> 00:00:32,164
'cause I want you to hear it from me.

15
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:36,700
My wants around this area
are far more about my legacy

16
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,018
and how I go to sleep at night
than the financial packs.

17
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:41,851
For me.

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,793
I'm so much more driven by legacy.

19
00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:52,232
Legacy is greater than currency.

20
00:00:52,232 --> 00:00:54,429
Let's get in to that
statement a little bit more.

21
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,727
One of my favorite, kind of,

22
00:00:55,727 --> 00:00:57,014
I'm not sure if anybody's
ever said it before,

23
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:58,843
I'm sure somebody has
but I'm all about it.

24
00:00:58,843 --> 00:01:01,270
What do I mean when I say
legacy is greater than currency?

25
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,687
You know, I always go from self,

26
00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:06,163
inside of myself when I
communicate and talk to people

27
00:01:06,163 --> 00:01:07,743
and that's why I think
I'm able to articulate it

28
00:01:07,743 --> 00:01:09,551
because it's my DNA, right?

29
00:01:09,551 --> 00:01:11,745
So everything I've ever done,

30
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:14,003
when I first got in to
the liquor store industry

31
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:16,604
with my dad, all I ever wanted to do

32
00:01:16,604 --> 00:01:18,856
was be the biggest wine shop in the world.

33
00:01:18,856 --> 00:01:20,334
That was the number one agenda.

34
00:01:20,334 --> 00:01:22,748
And so, what I talk about,

35
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:24,768
every business decision that I ever made,

36
00:01:24,768 --> 00:01:28,616
every one of them was always
based on my longterm legacy

37
00:01:28,616 --> 00:01:31,570
as being the biggest wine
retailer in the world.

38
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,108
That was my entire thought process,

39
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:34,651
so when I was paying myself nothing

40
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:36,020
even though the business was exploding

41
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,372
and when I was letting other
managers take vacations

42
00:01:38,372 --> 00:01:39,951
in lieu of my vacation time,

43
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:42,036
all these decisions, every one of them,

44
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:44,636
you can't skimp, every one of them

45
00:01:44,636 --> 00:01:46,768
has to be about your longterm legacy.

46
00:01:46,768 --> 00:01:48,900
It can't be about the dollars
you're putting in your pocket.

47
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,092
In this world where things
are changing every minute,

48
00:01:51,092 --> 00:01:52,916
where players are changing every minute,

49
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:55,220
if you're a hustler, if
you're a very hard worker

50
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,308
and you're putting everything on the line,

51
00:01:57,308 --> 00:01:59,068
put it in to your own personal brand.

52
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:00,908
Just make rent, pay your bills,

53
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:03,110
and keep building your personal brand.

54
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,680
And always think of the big picture.

55
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,574
The legacy.

56
00:02:05,574 --> 00:02:07,774
Who are you going to be viewed as

57
00:02:07,774 --> 00:02:08,907
when it's all said and done?

58
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:10,892
Happy birthday.

59
00:02:10,893 --> 00:02:11,791
- What's this?

60
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:12,694
Oh my God.

61
00:02:12,694 --> 00:02:13,613
What is that?

62
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:15,062
- It's a Corzine signed jersey.

63
00:02:15,062 --> 00:02:15,895
- Are you serious?

64
00:02:15,895 --> 00:02:17,557
- Yep.

65
00:02:17,557 --> 00:02:19,247
- Hey, I got something for him.

66
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:22,216
It's Gary's sneaker in
a rice krispie treat.

67
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:23,081
- What?

68
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:25,053
That is so rad.

69
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:27,231
And the reason I keep pounding
it is because of this.

70
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,020
I truthfully believe all the way

71
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,829
that if every business decision you make,

72
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:34,556
from hiring a secretary
to what paper you buy,

73
00:02:34,556 --> 00:02:36,124
to every move you make,

74
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:37,506
if the first question you ask

75
00:02:37,506 --> 00:02:39,845
is how does this effect my legacy,

76
00:02:39,845 --> 00:02:41,054
my longterm legacy,

77
00:02:41,054 --> 00:02:42,337
when it's all said and done

78
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:44,594
I guarantee the currency
will be there at the end.

79
00:02:44,594 --> 00:02:46,655
The world is changing,
we're more connected.

80
00:02:46,655 --> 00:02:48,015
And your legacy, your maneuvering,

81
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:50,412
your decision-making process has to start

82
00:02:50,412 --> 00:02:51,713
at your longterm legacy.

83
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,684
Big picture always wins.

84
00:02:53,684 --> 00:02:56,020
And so, if you take
every decision out there

85
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,197
that you can make from who
you're gonna be surrounded by,

86
00:02:59,197 --> 00:03:01,164
who are your friends, right?

87
00:03:01,164 --> 00:03:03,004
People looking for short
term traffic, right?

88
00:03:03,004 --> 00:03:04,804
You know, dig, stumble
upon, this and that,

89
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:06,081
silly things like that,

90
00:03:06,081 --> 00:03:07,580
or who your circle of friends are

91
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,052
or any of those kinds of decisions,

92
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:13,028
minor decisions, what
conferences you go to,

93
00:03:13,028 --> 00:03:15,731
what color's your website, everything,

94
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:17,499
everything has to start with,

95
00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:21,194
how is this going to
impact my global legacy.

96
00:03:21,194 --> 00:03:23,291
And I guarantee you, when
you make legacy decisions

97
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:27,300
instead of quick cash decisions
or mid range cash decisions,

98
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,736
you're gonna win every time.

99
00:03:28,736 --> 00:03:30,973
When you come from that thought process,

100
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:33,060
when you add it to the DNA
game that we talked about,

101
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,759
being your DNA, when you add
it to not lying to yourself

102
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,648
and you start putting
these pieces in place,

103
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,924
you start winning.

104
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:44,174
(gentle, bouncy music)

105
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:47,886
How ya doing Babbin?

106
00:03:47,886 --> 00:03:48,719
- [Babin] Alright.

107
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,828
- Great.

108
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:51,134
So bunch of meetings, heading in now.

109
00:03:51,134 --> 00:03:52,935
Chris Bradley say what's up to the vlog.

110
00:03:52,935 --> 00:03:53,861
- What's up vlog?

111
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:55,723
- Chris Bradley, incredible,
creative at Vayner.

112
00:03:55,723 --> 00:03:57,307
Going in to a big client meeting.

113
00:03:57,307 --> 00:03:58,340
See how it goes.

114
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,909
Did we get anything today?

115
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:01,000
- [Babin] Very little.

116
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,744
- Sorry vlog.

117
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:03,577
I kind of like it.

118
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,444
And that's what you need to do.

119
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,565
You need to survive and thrive.

120
00:04:06,565 --> 00:04:08,094
You need to just keep it going,

121
00:04:08,094 --> 00:04:09,045
you know you've got to pay your bills,

122
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:10,776
see your family, do all
those things, right?

123
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:12,331
Stay healthy, have a little excess cash

124
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:14,425
just so you can buy a Wii or
something to make you happy.

125
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:17,877
But, at all times, all
times eye on the prize.

126
00:04:17,877 --> 00:04:20,975
Legacy is greater than currency.

127
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:23,142
(mumbles)

128
00:04:24,327 --> 00:04:25,440
All right, going to a Nicks game

129
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,788
with Marc Yudkin, Head Counsel.

130
00:04:28,788 --> 00:04:31,401
Super interesting day,
just got a lot done,

131
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:33,697
not leaving Babin with a whole, whole lot.

132
00:04:33,697 --> 00:04:34,729
Here's all I can tell you.

133
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:36,229
When you're in your fucking zone,

134
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:37,105
when you're doing your thing

135
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:37,938
you're not scared of anything

136
00:04:37,938 --> 00:04:40,567
even being in the middle of
the road, just walking at it.

137
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:42,073
You're just not fucking scared.

138
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,722
You're just in your fucking zone

139
00:04:43,722 --> 00:04:45,081
and that's where I'm at right now.

140
00:04:45,081 --> 00:04:46,697
I'm in my fucking zone.

141
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:48,196
My CEO zone.

142
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:49,754
My execution zone.

143
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:51,049
Scared of nothing.

144
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:52,275
Zero.

145
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:53,622
Goose egg.

146
00:04:53,622 --> 00:04:55,478
Robert fuckin' Parrish, double zero.

147
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:58,290
Benoit Benjamin, baby,
Benoit Benjamin, baby,

148
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,517
for you MBA old school fans.

149
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:01,350
I'm just feeling great

150
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,473
and I wish you the ability
to be in your fucking zone

151
00:05:04,473 --> 00:05:05,506
where it just all clicks,

152
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:06,875
you understand all the variables,

153
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,849
you know all the moves, it's the reps.

154
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:10,817
You've seen it before,

155
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:11,671
you've seen it before,

156
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:13,569
you've seen it before.

157
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:14,603
That's where I'm at.

158
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:16,897
Please, if anything, after this video,

159
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:19,417
what is your legacy is
going to be the question

160
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:20,769
you need to ask yourself

161
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:23,697
before you make any kind
of financial decision.

162
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:27,489
Legacy, my friends, is
greater than currency.

163
00:05:27,489 --> 00:00:00,000
(bouncy, playful beat)
