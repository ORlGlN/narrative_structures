1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,800
- I'd like to introduce
our first speaker of the day.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,700
Mr. Gary Vaynerchuk
builds businesses.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,000
Fresh out of college he took a
family wine business and grew it

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,333
from $3 million to
$60 million in just five years.

5
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:27,033
Now he runs VaynerMedia,
one of the world's hottest

6
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:30,867
social media
first digital agencies.

7
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:35,467
Along the way, Gary became a
prolific angel investor and

8
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:40,734
venture capitalist investing in
companies including Facebook,

9
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:45,800
Twitter, Tumblr, Uber, Birch Box

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,433
before cofounding Vayner/RSE,

11
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:52,266
a $25 million investment fund.

12
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:55,500
He's got a track
record of success.

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,100
Gary was named to both Crane and
Fortune magazine's 40 under 40

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,266
list in the past year.

15
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:05,934
He has profiled
in New York Times,

16
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:08,400
Fortune and Inc. magazines

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,567
and is frequently
sought to share his expertise on

18
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:17,700
CNN, Bloomberg TV,
CNBC and many more.

19
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,166
He's here today to provide
a unique perspective on the

20
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,800
changing perception of value.

21
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,800
I have my own kinda
interaction with Mr. Vaynerchuk.

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm watching 60 Minutes the
other day and he comes on

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,667
60 Minutes and I go,
"He's our speaker."

24
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:39,633
That was so cool.

25
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:42,433
Ladies and gentlemen,
please help us welcome

26
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:44,567
Mr. Gary Vaynerchuk.

27
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:47,133
(audience applause)

28
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:52,533
("Can't Stop The Feeling"
by Justin Timberlake)

29
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,600
- [Gary] First and foremost,
I want to thank my mom

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,600
for writing that intro.
(audience laughter)

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,433
That was nice.

32
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:08,532
I'm really excited to be here.

33
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:12,166
I'm gonna give you context on
how I got here and then actually

34
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:16,734
I'm gonna pontificate on what
I believe but mostly I'd like to

35
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:20,333
leave as much time as possible
for Q&amp;A because I think theory

36
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:24,300
is lovely but the fact of the
matter is I'm very obsessed

37
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,700
with the practitionership.

38
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,967
And the goal that I have here
which is I think I'll be talking

39
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:35,300
about a lot of stuff that people
are either blind to or don't

40
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,233
want to believe or aren't doing
and the reality is I'll deploy a

41
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:42,934
lot of the energy that I was
naturally gifted with and we'll

42
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:46,900
all feel good and debate and
then it will be next Thursday

43
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,433
and you'll be back to your norm
and a lot of this won't happen.

44
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:53,500
And so, my big goal very
honestly here this morning is to

45
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,567
get one or two people to
understand how phenomenal the

46
00:02:57,567 --> 00:03:01,033
opportunity for our businesses
is in the new world and try to

47
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:04,967
shift what I know is the
collective appetite towards the

48
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:08,934
landscape that I market in and
build businesses in which is a

49
00:03:08,934 --> 00:03:11,734
lot of people look at
these things as a negative.

50
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:14,133
A lot of people look at these
things as something they didn't

51
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:17,600
grow up with and they go
completely in the defense

52
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,767
instead of understanding
the offense of all of this.

53
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,633
So, let me start by saying this,

54
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:25,500
I love social media
because of two things.

55
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,734
Number one, it's just the
word that represents the current

56
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:30,300
state of the internet.

57
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,467
I think when people hear the
term "social media" it's very

58
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:36,166
easy to kind of think
it's this nice to have

59
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,400
up-and-coming little thing.

60
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,967
When you understand that this is
now the primary device of every

61
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:47,767
human being in our society and
over 50% of every minute that is

62
00:03:47,767 --> 00:03:51,734
spent on this device is spent
on one of those seven websites,

63
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:53,700
you know,
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,

64
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,000
Snapchat, YouTube, LinkedIn it
starts to get a little harder to

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,166
completely disrespect it as

66
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:03,300
something that may
sell somebody a product.

67
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,467
And so, for me, I love social
media because it sells stuff.

68
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:10,266
I want to set the
tone very quickly here.

69
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:14,333
I did not own a computer
until I was 19 years old.

70
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,734
I was not techy.

71
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:17,266
I was an awful student.

72
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:18,899
I don't love technology.

73
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,966
I don't give a
crap about gadgets.

74
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:24,567
I don't even want to ever own a
drone but I know I will have to

75
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:25,533
at some point.

76
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,333
I'm not into this.

77
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,367
I'm into making money because
I want to buy the New York Jets.

78
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:32,800
(audience laughter)

79
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:37,934
And so and 
I think this is important.

80
00:04:37,934 --> 00:04:41,333
The reason I'm more excited,
so I'm running out of here after

81
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,333
this keynote and I'm
going to Las Vegas to CES,

82
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,633
the computer electronic show and
I will spend the next two days

83
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:52,433
spending all my time with the
Fortune 500 CMOs who pay me tens

84
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:55,166
of millions of dollars to do
their marketing and to be very

85
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,934
honest there is no comparison to
the excitement that I have for

86
00:04:58,934 --> 00:05:01,834
this 60 to 90 minutes
in comparison to that.

87
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:05,967
Not because of the money or the
stage but because I'm so much

88
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:08,166
more you than I am them.

89
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,633
I was born in the Soviet Union.

90
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:12,567
I came to U.S. when I was three.

91
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:14,266
We were ridiculously poor.

92
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:16,967
My family lived in a
studio apartment in Queens,

93
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:20,967
New York with eight family
members in an apartment the size

94
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:23,200
of the stage
that I'm on right now.

95
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,233
My dad made two dollars an hour
being a stock boy in a liquor

96
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:30,900
store in Clark, New Jersey
and that's where I come from,

97
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,000
that's who I am.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I didn't know my dad until I was
14 years old because he would

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,900
leave before I woke up and got
home after I slept 'cause he

100
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,667
worked every day as a
stock boy and then a manager.

101
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:42,300
And I don't know if
any of you are immigrants,

102
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,433
anybody here an immigrant
or a child of an immigrant?

103
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:48,233
Immigrants have a
really interesting strategy.

104
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:52,667
It's called don't spend any
money on anything for a decade.

105
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:54,734
(audience laughter)

106
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:56,900
And that's what my
parents did and they

107
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,800
saved and my dad eventually
bought a small liquor store in

108
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,300
Springfield, New Jersey.

109
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,734
We moved to Edison, New Jersey
when my dad became the manager

110
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:06,667
of the Clark, New Jersey
liquor store and that's where my

111
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,800
entrepreneurial career began.

112
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,166
When I was six, I had a
five lemonade stand franchise.

113
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:16,367
(audience laughter)
I manipulated,

114
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:18,567
tricked, depends on
how you want to word this,

115
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:22,100
my friends to stand behind the
lemonade stands when I was in

116
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,767
first grade and
I would ride my Big Wheels.

117
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,100
How many of you
remember Big Wheels?

118
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,767
That little toy.

119
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:29,800
I used to ride my Big Wheels
at the end of the day to my

120
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,400
locations and pick
up my cash like I was

121
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,967
Tony Soprano or something.

122
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:35,700
(audience laughter)

123
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,266
So that's who I am.

124
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:39,834
I mean I'm starting to
paint you a very clear picture.

125
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:40,834
I actually, you know what?

126
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:41,800
This is the perfect crowd.

127
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't usually tell
this part of the story.

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,533
Actually that was
my second business.

129
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:49,266
My first business for about
two months before I segued into

130
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:52,100
lemonade was to run
around the neighborhood,

131
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,467
rip people's flowers out of
their yards and then ring their

132
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:57,667
doorbell and
sell it back to them.

133
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,867
(audience laughter)

134
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:01,433
So you're about to
hear a lot of noble,

135
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:03,967
care about your
customers, customer service,

136
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:08,033
word-of-mouth stuff but that's
the seed that I come from so

137
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:09,467
don't think I'm Mother Teresa.

138
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:12,600
When I was 12, I started
my first big business.

139
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm 41 so anybody in that age
group probably it skews a little

140
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,367
bit more male but if you're in
that age group baseball cards

141
00:07:19,367 --> 00:07:21,533
were the real pop
culture thing for us in fifth,

142
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:24,433
sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth,
tenth grade and I was making

143
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:27,100
$2-3000 a weekend selling

144
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,533
baseball cards in
the malls of New Jersey.

145
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:32,567
And I don't know about you but
when you're 13 and 14 and you

146
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:37,834
have $30,000 in cash under your
bed and you're not selling weed,

147
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:38,767
you're doing a good job.

148
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:40,934
(audience laughter)

149
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:43,734
So, you know, it's
really fascinating.

150
00:07:43,734 --> 00:07:46,300
I'm sure for a lot of you, you
feel this too as I look around

151
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,867
kind of get the
demo of this audience.

152
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:51,000
It's fascinating that
entrepreneurship is now cool.

153
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,166
It's crazy to me that people
follow me on the internet and

154
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,867
think like I have micro
internet celebrity around

155
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:58,333
just being a businessman.

156
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,633
For me, when I was growing up
getting D's and F's in school

157
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:04,600
which is what I did was
extremely rare for an immigrant

158
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,767
and was unbelievable that my
parents kind of gave me that

159
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:09,800
freedom to be the
entrepreneur that I was.

160
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,033
But it wasn't cool
to be a businessperson.

161
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,900
You know, grades were
the proxy of your success.

162
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,834
So I sit here and I think so
much about how much opportunity

163
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:21,767
came to me because of
the scale of the internet.

164
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,433
I was a D and F student.

165
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:25,066
I went to college.

166
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:28,467
I came home every weekend to
work at my dad's liquor store.

167
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:31,433
I fell in love with
wine when I was 15 or 16

168
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:33,033
because people collected it.

169
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:35,166
I hated working at my dad's
liquor store the first two or

170
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,734
three years because I was in
the basement bagging ice all day

171
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:39,767
making two bucks an hour.

172
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:42,567
I hated it instead of making
$1000 being a baseball card

173
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:44,633
dealer at the
mall, my own thing.

174
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:48,633
But some around 16, I realized
that people collected wine and

175
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:52,400
I loved my family and I wanted
to help and like any good punk

176
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,934
entrepreneurs 16-year-old,
I thought I could do it better

177
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,600
than my dad and
so I wanted to help.

178
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,633
I was very self-aware and
empathetic to this amazing

179
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:03,800
opportunity my family created
for me and I wanted to give back

180
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,233
to that business
but I wasn't interested

181
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:07,066
in selling beer or liquor.

182
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:09,400
The wine thing was very
fascinating to me and at 16,

183
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,033
17 I went all-in, pot committed
and learned more about wine than

184
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:15,700
any child should.

185
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,667
And that became my passion.

186
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:18,700
I went to college.

187
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,100
I'm in my dorm room in
1994, September of 1994.

188
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,133
I'm playing Madden '94,
dominating by the way,

189
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:27,100
and my friend
comes in and he goes,

190
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,433
"You have to come and see this."

191
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:30,600
I end my game,
I walk into the room and

192
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,667
my buddy's sitting there.

193
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:33,734
Just a couple of them
and they're at a computer.

194
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:37,166
Now, I'm really one,
there's some youngsters in here.

195
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,633
For people of my age and
above this will make sense.

196
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:42,400
I mean I had
literally at this point,

197
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,667
I'm about to turn 19.

198
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:49,700
At literally at this
point have spent

199
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,633
15 hours on the computer.

200
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,033
Right, nine.

201
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:55,867
I mean like probably computer
class but since I was trying to

202
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:58,900
sell baseball cards during
class I wasn't really on it.

203
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,400
So I'm in front
of this computer.

204
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,033
I mean I brought a word
processor to do my papers on.

205
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:06,200
Like just to wrap,
this is only 20 years ago.

206
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,033
Let's stick with this and then I
hear sound the changes my life

207
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:14,100
which (imitates dial-up modem).

208
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,700
Some of you might remember that.

209
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,000
The dial-up internet game where
AOL was charging two bucks a

210
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,767
minute after you used up your
free minutes and I said some

211
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:26,200
profound thing like, "Is this
the information superhighway?"

212
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,934
Because I had
heard of this thing.

213
00:10:27,934 --> 00:10:31,967
And within a couple of minutes
my friends were on chat rooms

214
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:33,300
trying to get girls.

215
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,633
And within the first
time that I sat again,

216
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:37,700
one more time
for the youngsters,

217
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,934
I actually watched
people on the internet

218
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:43,133
for 4 1/2 hours because

219
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:47,433
it was so crazy and then I
waited my turn and I got on the

220
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:50,667
internet within about an hour
I realized that there were these

221
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,367
chat rooms and bulletin boards

222
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:54,266
that were
selling baseball cards.

223
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:57,000
And within 24 hours
of being on the internet,

224
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,967
I realized that instead
of opening up 1,000 wine

225
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:05,000
superstores across the country
and building the Toys "R" Us of

226
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,533
wine that I was
going to do this thing.

227
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,500
And a year and
half later in 1996,

228
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,500
I launched one of the first
e-commerce wine businesses in

229
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,867
America called WineLibrary.com
and that was a good decision

230
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:21,934
except, and this
is super important,

231
00:11:21,934 --> 00:11:24,166
this is going to
really relate to what I hope

232
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,066
to achieve in this room.

233
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:28,467
What I'm gonna go into and what
I'm gonna do in the Q&amp;A with you

234
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:34,834
guys is try to push you to spend
time and money on storytelling

235
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:39,800
why somebody should buy your
services and your pool or spa

236
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,133
through the
platforms that exist here.

237
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:46,500
I'm going to tell you with a lot
of data and a crap load of heart

238
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,967
why I can replicate direct mail,
like I'm doing every day for

239
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:55,533
Wine Library right now, and
deliver 4 to 6 times the result

240
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:58,834
by making Facebook
ads act like direct mail

241
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:00,433
instead of direct mail.

242
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:04,133
I will do all that over the next
hour and change but here's the

243
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:06,300
part you have to
listen to carefully of where

244
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,600
Sasha Vaynerchuk, my dad,
did something really well.

245
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,900
I launched
WineLibrary.com in 1996.

246
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,367
It cost $15,000.

247
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,266
I just want
everybody to understand,

248
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:18,567
our business was doing
$3 million and change in top

249
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:21,667
line revenue on 
10% gross profit.

250
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:25,767
We were taking home $340,000
a year before our expenses.

251
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:28,033
Luckily, he didn't have a whole
lot of employees and he was able

252
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:30,400
to take home a little
bit of money but we were not

253
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,433
making a lot of money.

254
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:36,033
The prior six years' marketing
budget was less than $15,000.

255
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:37,433
And I don't mean per year.

256
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:39,100
I mean combined.

257
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,667
So I spend $15,000 as
a small business in 1996

258
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,467
to launch WineLibrary.com.

259
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:45,700
Couple of fun facts.

260
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,934
Number one, I knew nothing about
technology or the internet.

261
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,834
The Russian guy named Alex that
built it for me ripped me off at

262
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,467
a level where is
there camera here?

263
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:57,400
Yeah, Alex if I find you,
I'm gonna slice your throat.

264
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,567
(audience laughter)

265
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:01,533
Sorry, I just
needed that for me.

266
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:05,433
So, I spent $15,000 on
a piece of crap website and

267
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:08,700
in the first year we sold

268
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,967
$817 worth of wine

269
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:15,734
on the website
for the entire year.

270
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:20,433
Now I don't know how many of you
have a Soviet father but that

271
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:23,433
was not the ROI that
Sasha was looking for.

272
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:28,700
What's important is is that it
took me time to figure out what

273
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,066
was going on in that world.

274
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:33,467
I was still going to school so
it was half-pregnant but the

275
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:36,834
punchline is that same business
when I took over and was back

276
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:40,433
from school full time on
.com and the store I grew that

277
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:43,133
business from a $3 to a
$60 million business

278
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:44,800
in a five-year window.

279
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,633
I did it because of this.

280
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:51,066
If you really understand why
this is now become the thing

281
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:54,367
that I've attached myself to
that I say and how important it

282
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:57,734
is to you, everything
will change in your business.

283
00:13:57,734 --> 00:14:00,333
And by the way, what I'm talking
about today and I think you know

284
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,233
it's funny to watch the
presidential election caught

285
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:06,000
people off guard in
the way that was marketed.

286
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,300
If you care about the nonprofit
that you're associated with.

287
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,834
If you care about helping your
school raise money or whatever

288
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:15,567
it is, what we are
living through my friends is the

289
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:19,934
greatest shift in communication
since the printing press.

290
00:14:19,934 --> 00:14:22,567
The way we communicate, do
you understand that there are a

291
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:26,567
grown ass men in this
room that sent poop emoji's

292
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:27,934
via text last night?

293
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,433
(audience laughter)

294
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,100
You're, you this is
not high school now,

295
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,834
your parents are
living on these platforms.

296
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:42,600
Your mother is on
Facebook right this minute.

297
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,066
And you know
what's great about her?

298
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:47,834
She goes through it real slow.

299
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:50,834
Which lets me sell
to her even better.

300
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:54,100
The great, pssst, secret right
now for me is I'm converting

301
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,066
more dollars at 50 to
80-year-olds than I am from

302
00:14:57,066 --> 00:15:00,000
20 to 30-year-olds on Facebook
because the speed in which they

303
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,100
go through the content.

304
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,934
The amount of you that
sit here and act one way.

305
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:07,734
You've got an Instagram account.

306
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:09,166
You're on Facebook.

307
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:13,133
You're debating if you should
get on Snapchat and then when

308
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:16,166
you've put on your business
hat and clothes and go into the

309
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,367
office you don't market that
way 'cause you don't think your

310
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:22,300
customers on it 'cause you
decided it's a young person

311
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,166
sport even
though your old, John,

312
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:30,567
is fascinating to me and that
dichotomy in 2017 world is

313
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:32,300
where all the opportunity it.

314
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,166
Attention is the
only thing that matters.

315
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,533
Why was I able to build
Wine Library with no money?

316
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:40,834
This is not a venture
capital based Instagram,

317
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:42,300
Snapchat, Facebook story.

318
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,467
This is a small business
in 1998 story with no money.

319
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:49,333
It was because I made every
penny that I spent work it's

320
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,467
face off and how did I do that?

321
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:53,934
Instead of doing direct mail
and some of the other things,

322
00:15:53,934 --> 00:15:56,000
newspapers, and I did
all those things by the way.

323
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,633
Just so everybody
knows I did direct mail.

324
00:15:57,633 --> 00:16:00,066
If anybody here,
anybody here from New Jersey?

325
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:03,834
Right, so you might've saw the
billboards that I put on the

326
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:05,000
Turnpike and 78.

327
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,200
Like I did everything but I
always created call to actions

328
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,266
to understand the ROI against
it 'cause I have the benefit of

329
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:13,667
being a retailer just like you.

330
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:14,500
This is easy.

331
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,934
You will know if these dollars
are effective because you

332
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,066
control the whole
funnel of the transaction.

333
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,867
When I work with Budweiser or
when I work with Under Armour,

334
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:23,867
they got so many different
behaviors going and they're not

335
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:25,633
selling it direct, it's
happening in other channels,

336
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:29,200
they don't know if it's TV or if
it's radio or if it's marketing

337
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,066
or promotions or Facebook.

338
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:33,633
You have that advantage
so here's what happened.

339
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:38,500
In 1997, I had a huge email
newsletter that I built by every

340
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,133
time anybody
walked into the wine shop,

341
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:44,100
I collected their email and
I built a huge 100,000+ person

342
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:50,700
email newsletter and I had
89.9% open rates because in 1997

343
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,300
nobody was sending email.

344
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,200
And so, what I was doing was
I was day trading attention.

345
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,633
In 1997, when there was only a
table of this size at the

346
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:03,066
North New Jersey Chamber of
Commerce event when I was like,

347
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:06,433
"Hey guys, the internet," while
they were spending money on

348
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:09,834
direct mail, I was
sending email at no cost.

349
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:13,767
It was free and I was selling
faster and more and people were

350
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:18,500
paying attention even though
not everybody was on email.

351
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,200
My friends, it doesn't matter if
you're on Instagram or Snapchat

352
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,733
or Facebook, it
matters that your customer is.

353
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:31,166
You don't get to decide on a
focus group of one that this is

354
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,800
the way that
everybody acts and is.

355
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,300
If you do not understand that
every penny you pour into this

356
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:43,667
platform to try to sell what
you sell is a higher ROI than

357
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:47,066
anything else you've done then
you are missing the absolute

358
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,066
opportunity in '17.

359
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:49,400
And let me
explain what that means.

360
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,967
The biggest fear I have
in this room is success.

361
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:55,166
I hate coming to these kind of
conferences where it's the best

362
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,300
of the bunch because
success, I love when people,

363
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,567
I'll do this whole thing and
they'll be spending all their

364
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:02,166
money on print or not at all.

365
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,533
I mean there's a lot of
people here who are first,

366
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:06,567
second, 10, 15,
20 years in business,

367
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:09,233
everybody here knows this
is a word-of-mouth business.

368
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:11,567
And I don't mean pools and spas.

369
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:13,266
I mean everything.

370
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:15,033
Word-of-mouth is the game.

371
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:19,967
What I'm stunned by is the
complete misunderstanding that

372
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:23,433
social media is the
current plumbing of

373
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:25,300
word-of-mouth in our society.

374
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,567
If you crush it for somebody and
you put in super nice and it's

375
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,600
all great and you're
unbelievable and you did

376
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,033
everything
perfect in your services,

377
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:37,667
how do people do you
think that person told in 1986?

378
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:40,033
In 1994? In 2001?

379
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:42,767
A couple of friends
when they came over?

380
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:44,166
Seven? Nine?

381
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,533
Do you know how many people they
now tell after they take one

382
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:49,467
picture and put it on
Facebook and Instagram.

383
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:51,600
Everybody they know.

384
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,333
And so, to me, I'm fascinated
because I've lived it.

385
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,300
This isn't, "Hey, I've invented
this thing Pinterest and

386
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,266
"you should use it."

387
00:18:59,266 --> 00:19:01,467
This is we have no money.

388
00:19:01,467 --> 00:19:04,000
We spent it on
email marketing in '97.

389
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,667
Then something
came out called Google.

390
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:09,834
The only time my dad fought me
in my career of something that

391
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:11,266
I wanted to do was Google.

392
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:14,600
Google comes out, it
starts doing better than Yahoo.

393
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,133
I'm fascinated by it and then
they start something called

394
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:18,433
AdWords, right?

395
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:19,867
At this point, you
all know what that is.

396
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:24,033
The day came out, I wanted to
buy the word "wine" on AdWords.

397
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:26,600
It was five cents
a click, minimum bid.

398
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,033
Nobody was on it yet.

399
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:31,600
I was there so I start
running it and it is crushing.

400
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,567
There's never been
anything close to it.

401
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:38,333
That run of 2001,
'02, '03 of Google AdWords,

402
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,266
I've never had better marketing
success other than what I'm

403
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:44,133
living through right now
on Facebook ads and

404
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:47,567
Instagram influencers doing
promotion right now.

405
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:50,166
That's why I'm
so loud right now.

406
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:53,266
If you've watch my career,
seems like a couple you on body

407
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:55,400
language have known
a little bit about me.

408
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,500
I was very quiet for the last
two or three years while I was

409
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,033
building VaynerMedia and doing
things so it was nothing crazy.

410
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,033
There was nothing that was so
blatantly underpriced if

411
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:05,367
you day trade attention.

412
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,967
Right now, that is
Facebook advertising.

413
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:10,367
That is Instagram influencers.

414
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,433
A mom in a neighborhood with
1,700 people that follow her on

415
00:20:14,433 --> 00:20:18,567
Instagram that you could pay
$150 or give her free services

416
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:20,233
for and she gives
you a shout out and

417
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:22,734
you convert four people, that.

418
00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:26,934
So to me, Google AdWords was
insane but my dad fought me

419
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,767
because he said to
me so it's working,

420
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:30,433
it's black and white.

421
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:32,800
I show him I go,
"I want to bet the farm."

422
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,767
The one thing that is great
about marketing is when you've

423
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:38,066
got the best hand,
you go pot committed.

424
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:40,700
So I wanted to go all-in on
Google Adwords and my dad was,

425
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,033
check this out, my dad didn't
want to do it 'cause he thought

426
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,967
our competitors would go
to Google and click our ads.

427
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:49,734
Like that's how
early it was back then.

428
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:51,300
And so, anyway,
luckily we did it.

429
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:56,100
We exploded and then my
career took a huge turn in 2006.

430
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,200
YouTube came out.

431
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,166
I thought it was
gonna be a big deal.

432
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,567
I started making a
wine show and this is,

433
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,066
I want to go into this phase
right now and this is where I'm

434
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:07,400
hopeful one or two of you really
latch onto and try to perform

435
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,333
this for yourselves because this
is my belief where there's the

436
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,934
most upside for your
business in the room.

437
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:16,000
Out of everything I just I just
got finished saying two minutes

438
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,800
ago that Facebook ads and
Instagram influencers are the

439
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,667
best arbitrage and the best buy
that I've seen in marketing in a

440
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:26,767
decade but what I'm about to go
into has the most upside for you

441
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:29,300
to transcend the
revenue of your business.

442
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,333
The problem is
it's extremely hard.

443
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,300
But here we go.

444
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,700
In 2006 YouTube
comes out, I go,

445
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,100
"Holy crap, this is a
huge," and I sit down

446
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,200
I start a show
called Wine Library TV.

447
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,567
I send when my
stock boys to Best Buy,

448
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:42,834
he buys a camera.

449
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,066
I sit down in my office.

450
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:47,100
I get the wine staff to pick me
some bottles of wine to taste

451
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,266
and I'm thinking that
I'm about to do QVC, right?

452
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:53,433
That's the
mentality I went in with.

453
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:54,767
If you're grew up in New Jersey,

454
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:58,533
I was really gonna go
Crazy Eddie meets QVC.

455
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:02,166
And so I'm ready, I'm pumped and
here we go and that camera goes

456
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:05,967
on and I realize, "Holy crap,
this is going to sit on the

457
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:09,233
"internet forever," and
literally like sometimes I look

458
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:12,400
back at episode one I can see,
'cause I know myself obviously,

459
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,500
I can see somewhere around a
minute or two in like uh-oh this

460
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,467
is not what I should do.

461
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:21,867
And right then and there, in the
first episode in the first five

462
00:22:21,867 --> 00:22:25,100
minutes of something I went
on to do 1000 episodes of,

463
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,967
over four and a half,
five years,

464
00:22:26,967 --> 00:22:30,567
I realized I needed to
become America's wine guy,

465
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:33,066
not a salesman for Wine Library.

466
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:35,967
And the reason it became his
huge phenomenon for 90% of you

467
00:22:35,967 --> 00:22:38,967
that don't know it became a show
that hundreds of thousands of

468
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:42,133
people started watching a day
and I did five days a week and

469
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:45,200
the format was me
sitting at a table drinking

470
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,166
four bottles of wine.
(audience laughter)

471
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,967
By the way, best gig I ever had.

472
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:53,734
But what confused people,
as you can imagine,

473
00:22:53,734 --> 00:22:56,600
what confused people was these
were wines that I had hundreds

474
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,900
of cases in stock of I would
pour it and taste it and would

475
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,900
tell people not to drink it.

476
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,367
Yeah, my staff was the same way.

477
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:05,800
Not to drink it.

478
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,066
That it reminded me of a
sheep taking a poop, right?

479
00:23:10,066 --> 00:23:14,166
Or that it tasted like rubber or
that it was too sweet and it was

480
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:17,033
chaos internally
within my company.

481
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:19,800
But what I was doing was
I was building credibility.

482
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,333
And I was leveling up.

483
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,400
I don't want you to be
necessarily the consultant of

484
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,567
pool and spa services.

485
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:27,433
You could even
go into home decor.

486
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:29,567
You could even
go into landscaping.

487
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:33,333
You've got your skills
but if you are an extrovert,

488
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:36,100
if you are somebody who thinks
that they can feel comfortable

489
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,266
in front of the camera now I'm
gonna take it to another place.

490
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:42,400
I don't know how, how many of
you are now or in the last year

491
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,967
have actively listened
to a podcast of any sort?

492
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,333
Raise your hands.
Raise 'em high.

493
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:48,900
High, I want to see it.

494
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,500
Raise it high 'cause
I, actually do me a favor.

495
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,834
It's early and
it's good to get blood.

496
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:54,367
If you, all the
hands, stand up for a second.

497
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:55,867
I want people to
visually see this.

498
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,033
If you actively in the
last year listened to a

499
00:23:58,033 --> 00:24:00,300
podcast of some sort.

500
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,633
So, don't sit yet,
I want to really watch this.

501
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:06,667
This is a very high percentage
of a room that again I think we

502
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:10,133
can all collectively agree, this
is not a 15-year-old teenage

503
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:13,133
girl aged crowd, right?

504
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:15,333
What's happened is
technology is changing.

505
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,433
Podcast, thank you for
standing, I appreciate it.

506
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:21,600
So podcasts is another place

507
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,233
where I want you to debate.

508
00:24:23,233 --> 00:24:25,166
Here's where I'm actually going.

509
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:29,433
I am asking, I am
challenging this room

510
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:32,300
to debate this concept.

511
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,667
What would it look like
if you started a weekly show,

512
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:39,300
whether it was a
radio show on podcast,

513
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,767
whether it was a video show on
Facebook video and YouTube or

514
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:46,200
whether it was a weekly thing
that you wrote on Medium or

515
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,700
LinkedIn or Facebook, what would
happen if you didn't think of

516
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,400
yourselves as resellers and
retailers and service providers

517
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,767
but as a media
company, retailer?

518
00:24:57,767 --> 00:25:02,266
Now, listen again, this is the
great advantage of coming from

519
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:04,467
exactly where you live.

520
00:25:04,467 --> 00:25:09,300
If I walked in to my dad's
office in 2006 and pitched what

521
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,433
I just said
'cause it's what I lived,

522
00:25:11,433 --> 00:25:13,767
he would've
punched me in the face.

523
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:15,667
He would've said I have no
idea what you're talking about.

524
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:19,133
This 10 years ago, 11 years of
right now everybody sitting in

525
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:20,767
saying what is this,
where is he going?

526
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:23,233
What does that mean?

527
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:27,300
What I know is the
following; all the attention,

528
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,467
all of it is going here.

529
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:33,333
What that means is distribution
has been commoditized.

530
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:38,767
No longer do you have to pay for
distribution if you can produce

531
00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:41,166
the content that is effective.

532
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,900
It's smart to pay for
distribution on these platforms

533
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,834
but you don't have to.

534
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,900
It can happen organic.

535
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,166
You can get there and
you could spend some of

536
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:50,367
your money building it.

537
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:54,233
What also happens is your end
consumer starts latching onto

538
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:57,734
you at a higher level than
just the transaction that you're

539
00:25:57,734 --> 00:25:58,867
trying to do with them.

540
00:25:58,867 --> 00:26:03,367
And for anybody in this room and
I did my homework before I came

541
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:07,066
to do this talk, anybody in this
room who isn't trying to triple

542
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:11,667
down, 10X down, on being in
the service business above and

543
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:14,467
beyond after the first
transaction is just not running

544
00:26:14,467 --> 00:26:16,333
a smart business as they can.

545
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:19,600
That is where all the economics
are in what you do for a living

546
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,600
and if you can actually use the
pool or spa as the gateway drug

547
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,433
to services
around the entire house,

548
00:26:26,433 --> 00:26:30,100
let alone those two units,
that's when you start getting

549
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,066
into the economics that change
you from being a seven-figure

550
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:35,800
business into an
eight figure business.

551
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,667
Very honestly, by the
way, I just want everybody to

552
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:39,834
understand one thing
that's very important to me,

553
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:43,233
everything that
I talk about is hard.

554
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:45,967
Everything that I talk about
takes a crap load of work.

555
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:49,100
Everything I talk about takes
away from you watching entire

556
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,700
seasons of "House of Cards."

557
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,767
So if you sit in this room and
you've put in your 30 years and

558
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:57,700
you're happy with how much
money's in the bank and you're

559
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,266
feeling good and
you're a little tired,

560
00:27:00,266 --> 00:27:02,266
you don't have to listen to me.

561
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:05,500
But if you want
more this is offense.

562
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,533
If you want more, this is
offense and I promise you here's

563
00:27:08,533 --> 00:27:12,800
the part that
really makes me ponder.

564
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,767
Right now, it's offense.

565
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:19,600
In 2022, it's
going to be defense.

566
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,400
How many people here are
retiring in the next five years?

567
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,967
And I don't mean
you're gonna crush it and

568
00:27:25,967 --> 00:27:27,667
retire and buy a boat.

569
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:29,767
I mean you're old
and you're finished?

570
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:32,533
(audience laughter)

571
00:27:32,533 --> 00:27:35,667
Raise your hands high.

572
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:36,767
Respect.

573
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:40,100
Alright, so for the four
of you old dudes, respect.

574
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,333
Go fish.
(audience laughter)

575
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:45,367
For the 99.8% of
the rest of this room,

576
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:46,700
everything I'm
talking about right now,

577
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,900
if you have the audacity to own
your own business and live the

578
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,300
life that entrepreneurship and

579
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,400
owning your own
business allows you

580
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,066
and you do not put in the
hours over the next half decade

581
00:27:58,066 --> 00:28:01,500
to educate yourself, I do not
want anybody running out of this

582
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,133
talk saying, "Wait
a minute, he's right.

583
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:07,333
"I'm in a letter 23-year-old
niece now do her thing."

584
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:11,033
This is not your outsourcing it
to that young buck and I know

585
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:12,367
that's why some of
you laughed, you're like,

586
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:14,500
"Yeah, Nancy gonna,"
no, no, not Nancy,

587
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,800
you John you're gonna do it.

588
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,300
If you own your business in this
room you need to spend 50 to 100

589
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:26,033
hours on the internet reading or
watching videos or listening,

590
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:29,133
I don't know how you learn but
you need to understand where

591
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:32,100
your end consumer's attention is
because you're not to be able to

592
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,500
reach them and
word-of-mouth, listen guys,

593
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,500
one more time.

594
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,900
Think about this,
this is so good.

595
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,667
I've actually never said this
publicly just literally came to

596
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:42,934
my head, you know how we're
talking about social norms?

597
00:28:42,934 --> 00:28:45,166
You know you're talking
about how upset you are?

598
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:48,800
One of my favorite debates of
parents right now is they say

599
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,934
that their children aren't,
don't know how to be social.

600
00:28:52,934 --> 00:28:55,033
They've decided,
parents in this room,

601
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:58,300
have decided that our children,
their children are socially

602
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,900
awkward because they
only live in the phone.

603
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,367
They've decided that the way
humans communicate is only

604
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:08,500
defined by looking somebody in
the eye and using their mouth.

605
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:13,433
They have been romantic in this
room about the platform that one

606
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:16,567
communicates through instead
of actually communicating.

607
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:21,133
Every child 8 to 12 to
17 in America right now

608
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:24,433
is dramatically
more social than you.

609
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:28,800
Because when you were 12 and
none of your friends were around

610
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,633
and it was 4:30 on a Tuesday you
went outside and threw a ball

611
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:38,400
against the wall.
(audience laughter)

612
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,934
You interacted with a
tire rapped to a tree.

613
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:47,633
So you may not like the way they
communicate but I promise you

614
00:29:47,633 --> 00:29:50,266
they're the most
social that we've ever seen.

615
00:29:50,266 --> 00:29:52,500
They're just using a
device and a platform that

616
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,200
we didn't have access to.

617
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,033
Some of you begged to have your
own phone line in your room so

618
00:29:58,033 --> 00:29:59,934
you could be on the
phone with your girlfriend for

619
00:29:59,934 --> 00:30:04,700
seven hours watching 90210.

620
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:09,734
Yes, I don't know how social
that was but here's what I know.

621
00:30:09,734 --> 00:30:12,500
I know that the thing that
you're complaining about is

622
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,367
going to hurt your business
because as we continue to

623
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:19,133
communicate that way the way we
recommend products and service

624
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:21,467
will continue
to happen that way.

625
00:30:21,467 --> 00:30:24,367
When 29-year-old Sally who's 17

626
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:27,100
or 19 or 21 right now is only

627
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,734
talking to her friends when they
first buy their or 41-year-old

628
00:30:30,734 --> 00:30:33,834
Sally, I always try, I
want to remind everybody.

629
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:36,200
This is not 2008 anymore.

630
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,000
This is not what's coming.

631
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,834
This is what happened.

632
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:45,000
98% of the Fortune 500 CPG
brands in America declined last

633
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,100
year because they
continue to think the following,

634
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,967
watch this.

635
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:50,533
You really want to get
is the macro of all this.

636
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:54,533
How many people here now when
they watch television when you

637
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:57,934
watch your favorite TV
shows outside of live sports,

638
00:30:57,934 --> 00:31:01,533
now watch them when you want to
watch them not when they air?

639
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:06,400
Netflix, DVR, TiVo,
on-demand, raise your hands.

640
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,700
High, high.

641
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,033
Great everybody, 90%.

642
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:17,433
How many of you fast-forward
every single commercial when

643
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:18,300
given the opportunity?

644
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,300
Raise your hands.

645
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:28,667
90% and even if the brands,
my brands that spend,

646
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:32,000
stick with me here,
collectively tens I think it's

647
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
now $80 billion to
make 30 second videos

648
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,133
and then air them in-between

649
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:41,066
shows that you
actually want to watch,

650
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:45,900
even if they're lucky enough to
have you have a chance to see

651
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,800
them because the remote
control falls off the bed.

652
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,100
(audience laughter)
Even if that miracle happens,

653
00:31:56,567 --> 00:32:00,333
every person here the second
their favorite show goes into

654
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:04,633
commercial grabs this.

655
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:07,600
And this is where
the attention is

656
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,266
and that at a macro is what

657
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:11,867
I'm worried about you.

658
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:15,667
You're not, you are not like
Sonic restaurants or Toyota my

659
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,567
client in
spending on television.

660
00:32:17,567 --> 00:32:19,000
You're spending
on something else.

661
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
But boy, is my intuition that
it's not being spent in the best

662
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,400
place that that dollar can be
spent or even more scary because

663
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,300
you've been so successful and
you were the king or queen of

664
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,867
that town you've gone completely
complacent and aren't spending

665
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:37,567
at all 'cause word-of-mouth is
in process which creates the

666
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:38,934
greatest vulnerability and

667
00:32:38,934 --> 00:32:43,133
I promise you in
2022 and in 2024

668
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:45,967
it's not just the kid at the
table there was going to do it

669
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:50,867
better, it's also going to
be the macro discussion of,

670
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:52,867
you think Amazon
cares about your feelings?

671
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:58,867
You think Walmart spent 
$20 billion buying e-commerce

672
00:32:58,867 --> 00:33:02,734
sites so you can
sell pools and spas?

673
00:33:02,734 --> 00:33:05,333
Where do you
think the world's going?

674
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:09,734
And so, if you are not planning
on retiring in the next five

675
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:13,433
years then you need to start
really understanding what's

676
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:15,000
happening because 
I'm just talking about

677
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,400
simple social media right now.

678
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,533
How many people have
an Alexa in the home?

679
00:33:19,533 --> 00:33:20,834
Raise your hand.

680
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:23,166
How many people have
an Alexa in their home?

681
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:24,367
An Echo, one more time.

682
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:26,200
Alexa Echo. Okay.

683
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,800
How many people don't
know what that is actually?

684
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,200
It's okay, I just
want to get a sense.

685
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,500
Great, man that guy in
the back there loves retiring,

686
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,800
loves not knowing anything.

687
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,467
I love that dude.

688
00:33:35,467 --> 00:33:37,734
I just got to find him, yeah.

689
00:33:37,734 --> 00:33:39,166
He's old school, huh?

690
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:40,133
I like that dude.

691
00:33:40,133 --> 00:33:45,200
Alright, anyway.
(audience laughter)

692
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,333
Let me just give
you the average day for

693
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:51,233
somebody needs to have
their pool serviced in 2023.

694
00:33:51,233 --> 00:33:54,066
Alexa, I want my pool serviced.

695
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,500
That's it.

696
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,100
And I'd think it be really smart
if you understood how social

697
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,767
media worked in 2017 so that
when you have to understand how

698
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:08,000
Alexa's algorithm works in 2020
that you're the answer to that

699
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,467
question not Amazon
itself or somebody else.

700
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,934
Guys, the
stakes are much higher.

701
00:34:13,934 --> 00:34:17,132
Please do me a favor, please go
read what happened during the

702
00:34:17,132 --> 00:34:20,467
Industrial Revolution and how
many people went out of business

703
00:34:20,467 --> 00:34:23,100
out of complacency because they
didn't understand that we were

704
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,967
living through the biggest
technology shift of that era.

705
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:27,833
We are fully in it.

706
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:30,967
We're now in it and
so over the next decade,

707
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:34,199
I want to remind you that 10
years ago everything we live on

708
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,600
now didn't exist.

709
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,567
10, 10 years ago it's 11
for some of the websites,

710
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:42,766
10 years ago no smartphone.

711
00:34:42,766 --> 00:34:44,500
10 years ago.

712
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,734
10 years ago,
YouTube's 11, Facebook's 11.

713
00:34:47,734 --> 00:34:51,367
These are, if you 
think a lot's happened

714
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:53,433
in the last 10 years

715
00:34:53,433 --> 00:34:56,100
wait 'til you see what
happens over the next 10 years.

716
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,800
The stakes are enormously high

717
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,233
and I'm not here fear mongering.

718
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:02,200
This is just what's happening.

719
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,834
Very honestly, the fact that
you're the crĂ¨me de la crĂ¨me,

720
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:10,433
I assume that the
majority of people

721
00:35:10,433 --> 00:35:12,300
in this room are like yes.

722
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,266
This is the opportunity.

723
00:35:13,266 --> 00:35:16,500
This is where I transition from
a $6 million a year business to

724
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,734
$15 million a year business.

725
00:35:17,734 --> 00:35:20,867
This is when I transition from
$180,000 a year business

726
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:22,200
to a $2.9 million
a year business.

727
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,934
This is pure opportunity.

728
00:35:23,934 --> 00:35:26,900
The problem is and this is where
everybody defaults into they

729
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,433
raise their hand, Gary,
I didn't grow up with this.

730
00:35:29,433 --> 00:35:30,734
Me neither, Carl.

731
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:33,533
(audience laughter)

732
00:35:33,533 --> 00:35:36,734
I didn't grow up
with this either, Carl.

733
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:37,934
And guess what, Carl?

734
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:41,433
You didn't grow up
driving and you figured it out.

735
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:44,233
Understanding the digital
landscape and what our consumers

736
00:35:44,233 --> 00:35:47,800
are doing on it is
now oxygen for businesses.

737
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,700
If you do not understand it,
you will be destroyed.

738
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,066
I've lived this.

739
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:55,934
I gave a keynote, so I
was an early investor in Uber.

740
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:59,700
I give a keynote at the limo and
taxi service thing and when they

741
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,200
announced me they said
Uber and a couple booed.

742
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,700
Half of them, just
like the Alexa thing didn't

743
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,667
even know it existed yet.

744
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:09,066
And I said, my friends, you have
to understand what this means.

745
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,567
And where I really went with the
talk and this is where I want to

746
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:15,166
go with you to bring you value
versus telling you a story,

747
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:17,066
here's my thesis.

748
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:22,066
My thesis is very simple, it is
far better to put yourself out

749
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:26,734
of business than to have
somebody else do it for you.

750
00:36:26,734 --> 00:36:31,400
And what I mean by that is if
you know your vulnerability,

751
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,400
whatever you heard
here whatever you know,

752
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,266
well then you should
start doing that to curtail that

753
00:36:37,266 --> 00:36:41,166
vulnerability and the reason I
want you to build a media brand

754
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:45,600
around you is no
technology, not Alexa,

755
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,900
not Facebook, not anything that
gets invented that we don't know

756
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,567
exist now, none of that builds
or beats brand because they're

757
00:36:53,567 --> 00:36:57,066
not gonna ask Alexa for

758
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:59,500
"Let me service my pool
or who should I go with?"

759
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,333
They're gonna say I
want to go with David.

760
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,233
Call David and fix my pool.

761
00:37:03,233 --> 00:37:05,567
And that's called brand.

762
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:06,934
And there's a
very big difference,

763
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:10,133
my friends,
between brand and sales.

764
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:13,133
And 90% of people are
in the sales business.

765
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:15,767
The direct mail
is a call to action,

766
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:16,934
it's a sale.

767
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:19,900
The Facebook stuff that
you've been doing and I did some

768
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,567
homework it's not
working 'cause you're selling.

769
00:37:23,567 --> 00:37:25,767
You're not even
trying to romance a girl,

770
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:29,633
you're going right in.
(audience laughter)

771
00:37:29,633 --> 00:37:31,233
How about making a video that's

772
00:37:31,233 --> 00:37:35,767
instructional that can actually
help people to know what to do.

773
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:37,433
Now you've provided value.

774
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:40,433
I taught people how to
decant, this is very nerdy,

775
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:44,700
my decanting how to decant wine
video that was the gateway to

776
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,200
$1.7 million worth of sales.

777
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,266
It was very easy.
I watched it.

778
00:37:50,266 --> 00:37:53,200
They'd go to YouTube, they'd
watch the decanting video.

779
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,934
They'd click WineLibrary.com
'cause it was linked below,

780
00:37:55,934 --> 00:37:59,200
they'd go to the website
and they'd buy something.

781
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,033
When you provide
value upfront, you win.

782
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:05,834
I've written four New York Times
best selling books.

783
00:38:05,834 --> 00:38:07,400
The one that is
sold the least is called

784
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,367
"The Thank You Economy."

785
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:11,934
It's the one
that matters the most.

786
00:38:11,934 --> 00:38:15,233
And the reason it's sold
the least is 'cause nobody

787
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:17,600
wants to do the work.

788
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,333
When people are done
reading it they put down a say,

789
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:22,633
"Screw that."

790
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:26,700
They don't want to provide the
upfront value and all I'm trying

791
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,700
to do in my career is
provide the upright value.

792
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,667
Basically my entire thesis of
selling which was the next book

793
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:37,533
I wrote, "Jab, Jab, Jab, Right
Hook" is how do I guilt you

794
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:39,734
into buying my stuff?

795
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,400
How do I provide you so
much value that it would be

796
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,133
inconceivable to you
to go with somebody else.

797
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:48,500
And that is what I want to
challenge everybody here to

798
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,800
think about as a thesis and then
what I want to spend the next

799
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,900
55, 50 minutes I want to start
Q&amp;A pretty quickly so let me

800
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,567
frame up Q&amp;A.

801
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:56,900
I'll talk a little
bit then we'll get going,

802
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,967
then we'll see how Q&amp;A.

803
00:38:58,967 --> 00:39:00,533
I want to go
very detail oriented.

804
00:39:00,533 --> 00:39:02,166
When we go in to
Q&amp;A I want to be like,

805
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:05,033
"Hey Gary, Sal, own
two stores in Minnesota,

806
00:39:05,033 --> 00:39:05,934
"you know, shops.

807
00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:07,900
"We tried
Facebook, it didn't work."

808
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,367
Let's go very
deep like how I set up?

809
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:10,400
Is Snapchat worth it?

810
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,133
Go very, to me this is
the opportunity this is the

811
00:39:14,133 --> 00:39:14,900
opportunity that this

812
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,367
organization has
created for you,

813
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:19,333
this is I think you
can go watch the first

814
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:21,166
30 minutes of this on YouTube.

815
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:23,033
What BioGuard did for you is
gave me enough time to do the

816
00:39:23,033 --> 00:39:25,834
Q&amp;A so please ask me your
direct questions digitally.

817
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:27,333
What websites still matter?

818
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:28,400
How do you think about this?

819
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,767
Let me give you
some other things.

820
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:32,467
By the way, day trading
attention my most exciting

821
00:39:32,467 --> 00:39:36,233
meeting is with a guy by name of
Bob Pittman tomorrow who started

822
00:39:36,233 --> 00:39:37,934
MTV who owns iHeartRadio.

823
00:39:37,934 --> 00:39:39,433
That's why I
asked about the podcast.

824
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:42,700
My belief is that drive time
radio is starting to get low

825
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,500
enough in cost that
it might be a deal again.

826
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,000
So I'm not digital-ist.

827
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,100
I'm an attention-ist.

828
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,667
I don't care where your
attention is if tomorrow I woke

829
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:54,834
up and Facebook,
Twitter, Instagram,

830
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:59,500
Snapchat, YouTube and LinkedIn
all disappeared I'd be pumped

831
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,000
because my contemporaries
would be confused and I would be

832
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,033
spending every minute figuring
out where everybody went.

833
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:07,367
And I would know for next
24 to 36 months it would be

834
00:40:07,367 --> 00:40:11,066
underpriced because while people
debated if it's gonna stick

835
00:40:11,066 --> 00:40:14,900
around or matter I'd be
executing and selling stuff.

836
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:19,166
So, that's the punchline.

837
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,934
Are we in a position, do
you think digitally first?

838
00:40:21,934 --> 00:40:25,033
The answer is no for
85, 90% of this audience.

839
00:40:25,033 --> 00:40:27,700
Are you, if you are,
for the other 15%,

840
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,033
are you complacent in the things
that got you here which was you

841
00:40:31,033 --> 00:40:33,233
were just like me
and you won on Google?

842
00:40:33,233 --> 00:40:36,033
And you won on Google Adwords
but now that's changing 'cause

843
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,734
that expense is going
higher and that's not branding

844
00:40:38,734 --> 00:40:39,533
'cause that sales.

845
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:40,467
That's just blue letters.

846
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:42,900
Have you figured out how to
make two-minute and three-minute

847
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,934
videos and put them on
Facebook to drive your business.

848
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:47,900
Have you figured out how to

849
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,834
get home and
lifestyle Instagram accounts?

850
00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:54,800
Paying them $100, $200 for a
shout out which then drives

851
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,700
conversion for you?

852
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:01,700
Have you figured out the new
arbitrages and inevitably

853
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,900
what are you gonna then
go and do about it?

854
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,600
Because the opportunity is real.

855
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,033
I believe for small businesses
in America you're on the clock.

856
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:13,767
When I gave this talk, a
very different version in 1999,

857
00:41:13,767 --> 00:41:15,200
you know who's D-Day it was?

858
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,133
It was called bookstores.

859
00:41:18,133 --> 00:41:22,100
They didn't know it but they
were done and then who was on

860
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:26,200
D-Day in 2009, '10, '11
cab and limo drivers.

861
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,000
Do you know how sad
it is personally for me?

862
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,400
As I told you
was born in Russia,

863
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,867
some of my dad's
friends went to LA and started,

864
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:34,633
you know, drove a
cab for 7, 8, 10 years.

865
00:41:34,633 --> 00:41:37,433
Then eventually saved up all
the money and bought a couple of

866
00:41:37,433 --> 00:41:39,133
cars and built their business.

867
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:40,934
Got to that age of 55, 56.

868
00:41:40,934 --> 00:41:42,867
Had something of a business that
was worth something they were

869
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:46,900
about to sell it off and in 24
months Uber destroyed the value

870
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,967
of their business by 90%.

871
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:51,900
One of my dad's friends was
gonna sell his business for

872
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:56,367
$3.7 million decided not to
for another year or two and

873
00:41:56,367 --> 00:41:58,367
sold for $370,000.

874
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,400
That's just real so
as we sit here today,

875
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,500
I promise you the Marriott
and the Hilton weren't sitting

876
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,834
around four
years ago and saying,

877
00:42:07,834 --> 00:42:09,633
"What are our
threats in the future?"

878
00:42:09,633 --> 00:42:11,867
I promise you nobody raised
their hand in that room and

879
00:42:11,867 --> 00:42:15,433
said, "Hey, wait a minute what
if somebody invents a website

880
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:19,367
"that is like the eBay
of people's actual homes and

881
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:21,066
"instead of staying in hotels

882
00:42:21,066 --> 00:42:24,000
"we would stay in
each other's homes?"

883
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
How many people here have
used an AirBnB or on AirBnB?

884
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,100
Raise your hands.

885
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,200
Raise them high.
I want people to look.

886
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
How many people here
don't know what AirBnB is?

887
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,433
I expect some, raise
your hand, it's okay.

888
00:42:36,433 --> 00:42:38,000
It's okay, don't worry.

889
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,266
AirBnB stands for
air bed and breakfast.

890
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:43,467
It is a website where people
list their homes and apartments

891
00:42:43,467 --> 00:42:47,967
when they're not there and other
people stay in people's homes.

892
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:52,133
That's what's hurting the hotel
industry and so you sit here

893
00:42:52,133 --> 00:42:54,967
today and I just want you to
do good content on Facebook,

894
00:42:54,967 --> 00:42:57,533
YouTube and Instagram 'cause
that's where the attention is

895
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:01,300
and I'm worried if there's some
kid that's Sally right now is

896
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,133
about to invent something that's
gonna really hurt you and so

897
00:43:04,133 --> 00:43:08,367
that's why this is what I call
almost like digital fitness.

898
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:11,533
There's no way to run a marathon
if you haven't been on the

899
00:43:11,533 --> 00:43:14,166
treadmill preparing for it.

900
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:17,000
The most important thing for
me for you to do Facebook and

901
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,033
Instagram and YouTube and
videos and content and podcasts,

902
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:24,133
the most important thing for me
is that it's getting you into

903
00:43:24,133 --> 00:43:27,033
the mindset of that world in
case you really

904
00:43:27,033 --> 00:43:28,633
need it in three or four years.

905
00:43:28,633 --> 00:43:30,900
Right now, I'm sitting here
and talking to you about the

906
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,400
differences of you growing your
business next year 4% versus

907
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,333
growing it 18%.

908
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:38,467
I don't want to come back here
in four years and talk about the

909
00:43:38,467 --> 00:43:40,133
difference between
you selling your business

910
00:43:40,133 --> 00:43:44,500
for $3.7 million or $370,000.

911
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,500
Thank you.

912
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:50,166
(audience applause)

913
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,100
So who's got questions?

914
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,633
Great.

915
00:43:59,633 --> 00:44:00,900
How many mic runners do we have?

916
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,834
One? Oh three, awesome.

917
00:44:02,834 --> 00:44:04,533
Great, let's start
with this lovely lady here.

918
00:44:06,633 --> 00:44:07,934
Thanks for having me guys.

919
00:44:07,934 --> 00:44:09,800
Jesus, I go in
such a weird trance.

920
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,800
I feel like I'm just
like getting out of it.

921
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,767
Hey, what's your name?
- Hey, my name's Mallory.

922
00:44:13,767 --> 00:44:14,867
- How are you Mallory?
- I'm from the

923
00:44:14,867 --> 00:44:16,500
Chicagoland area
- [Gary] Little closer to your

924
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,066
mouth,
- So...

925
00:44:18,066 --> 00:44:19,400
- A little closer.
- Closer?

926
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,500
- Yeah.
- OK one of my questions is,

927
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,767
where do you draw the line

928
00:44:22,767 --> 00:44:25,233
on informational and
actually teaching someone

929
00:44:25,233 --> 00:44:27,800
how to do something that
you're already trying to sell?

930
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,333
Like for our industry,
service is really big,

931
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:32,133
and I know our
owners have always worried

932
00:44:32,133 --> 00:44:34,467
how much content
we put on social media

933
00:44:34,467 --> 00:44:37,500
so that we're not
selling ourselves out.

934
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,100
- [Gary] If you don't do it
somebody else is gonna do it.

935
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,233
- Okay.

936
00:44:40,233 --> 00:44:41,333
Okay.

937
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:44,500
- Guys, have you
been on the internet?

938
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:47,700
What do you think,
you're not gonna do it Mal,

939
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,967
and your homies
are not gonna do it?

940
00:44:49,967 --> 00:44:53,166
What's gonna happen is some
entrepreneur's gonna do it

941
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:57,567
who works for one of your
companies, become the guy,

942
00:44:57,567 --> 00:44:58,900
and then get all
the referral business

943
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,633
to come through him.

944
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:02,734
And then he's
holding, whoever has

945
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:06,567
the end consumer's
attention has the leverage.

946
00:45:06,567 --> 00:45:09,300
So, give it away.

947
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,033
I would absolutely
give away milk to sell cows,

948
00:45:12,033 --> 00:45:14,467
all day long, but
people don't wanna do that,

949
00:45:14,467 --> 00:45:16,400
because they're
used to selling milk.

950
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,233
- [Mallory] Right.
- And that's why the guy

951
00:45:17,233 --> 00:45:19,867
that comes along and
gives away the milk for free

952
00:45:19,867 --> 00:45:21,734
kills all the other businesses.

953
00:45:21,734 --> 00:45:24,467
And the problem for you
is there's no cost of entry

954
00:45:24,467 --> 00:45:26,000
to giving away the information.

955
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,233
If I knew what the hell to do
with the stuff you guys do,

956
00:45:29,233 --> 00:45:30,767
I could do it right now.

957
00:45:30,767 --> 00:45:32,467
Luckily I don't
so please help me.

958
00:45:32,467 --> 00:45:33,734
But you know...

959
00:45:33,734 --> 00:45:34,800
- [Mallory] Okay.
- You know what I mean?

960
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,133
- [Mallory] That's always
been the work.

961
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:37,133
- And by the way,

962
00:45:37,133 --> 00:45:38,133
just 'cause you're
now gonna tell them

963
00:45:38,133 --> 00:45:39,734
'cause you met some
guy who wrote books,

964
00:45:39,734 --> 00:45:42,333
they're not gonna believe you.
- [Mallory] No, I know.

965
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:43,900
- [Gary] They're not 
gonna change.

966
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,367
That's why they're gonna lose,
'cause they deserve to lose.

967
00:45:47,367 --> 00:45:50,166
It makes me happy
that they're gonna lose.

968
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:52,233
That, by the way,
that's capitalism!

969
00:45:52,233 --> 00:45:54,266
Everybody loves
capitalism and business

970
00:45:54,266 --> 00:45:56,367
when it's in your favor.

971
00:45:56,367 --> 00:45:58,367
You loved it when
you outworked the old guy

972
00:45:58,367 --> 00:46:01,033
that used to be in
town and took the business.

973
00:46:01,033 --> 00:46:03,734
You don't like it
when it happens to you.

974
00:46:03,734 --> 00:46:06,066
That's why I make fun
of all my crony 60 and 70

975
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:09,500
and 80 year old white Republican
homies that are my friends

976
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,934
who want to then, after
hustling and making money

977
00:46:11,934 --> 00:46:14,700
want to change laws to
protect them, I'm like uh uh.

978
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,900
You're old now, you will die.

979
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,200
(audience laughter)

980
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,567
By the way, unless,

981
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:23,433
my business
partner's Stephen Ross,

982
00:46:23,433 --> 00:46:26,100
he owns 30% of VaynerMedia,
he's my partner in my fund,

983
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,567
he owns the Miami Dolphins,

984
00:46:27,567 --> 00:46:29,433
he's the biggest real
estate developer in America,

985
00:46:29,433 --> 00:46:31,500
it's called Related,
he's worth $13 billion,

986
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,066
he's 76 years old, and
if I text him right now

987
00:46:34,066 --> 00:46:38,433
and say hey, I just
found this weird shed in

988
00:46:38,433 --> 00:46:41,066
Louisiana and I think
we can buy it for 100,000

989
00:46:41,066 --> 00:46:43,600
and flip it into a
million dollar deal,

990
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,734
he'll text me back in one
minute, he loves the game.

991
00:46:46,734 --> 00:46:49,200
It's not about the money,
loves the game.

992
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,433
And that's the way it is.

993
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:51,433
Question?

994
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:52,266
Hey man.

995
00:46:52,266 --> 00:46:54,767
- Steven Metz Central Jersey
Pools, Freehold, New Jersey.

996
00:46:54,767 --> 00:46:56,166
- [Gary] Awesome,
where do you live?

997
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:57,400
- Freehold.
- [Gary] Oh Freehold,

998
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,200
I didn't catch that.
- Yes.

999
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,166
- [Gary] Yeah that's awesome.

1000
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:01,834
- So we've grown our Facebook
audience to a large number

1001
00:47:01,834 --> 00:47:04,800
but when we post videos--
- [Gary] Organic reach is dead.

1002
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,633
- It's dead.
- [Gary] Yes.

1003
00:47:06,633 --> 00:47:08,900
- So, is there any
way to get around that?

1004
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,166
- [Gary] Nope, pay.
- Just pay.

1005
00:47:10,166 --> 00:47:12,433
- [Gary] Just pay, and I'm
glad you asked that Steven

1006
00:47:12,433 --> 00:47:14,700
because that hurt so
many people's feelings.

1007
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,600
I wanted to
remind all those people,

1008
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,000
well you pay other places.

1009
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,133
So what happened
was, it was funny.

1010
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:24,033
If you check videos online I've
talked about this for years,

1011
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:25,567
it's starting to correct itself.

1012
00:47:25,567 --> 00:47:28,633
That was huge for me,
and my selfish interests

1013
00:47:28,633 --> 00:47:30,767
because while
everybody was emotional

1014
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:33,433
and saying that
Zuck screwed them,

1015
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:36,266
I was spending money
'cause it was underpriced.

1016
00:47:36,266 --> 00:47:38,367
It's incredible, you
can target people that are

1017
00:47:38,367 --> 00:47:42,200
$250,000 household
income within five mile radius

1018
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:46,700
of your office, and you
can pick other targeting.

1019
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,400
The big thing though, so yes
pay, it's still under priced.

1020
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,734
In two or three
years, five years,

1021
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:53,133
it'll be like Google and
it'll be priced accordingly,

1022
00:47:53,133 --> 00:47:54,300
and then it's
gonna be like Google

1023
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,033
in some categories, over priced.

1024
00:47:57,033 --> 00:47:59,800
But the key for you to really
think about is the content.

1025
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,367
'Cause once you
get my attention,

1026
00:48:01,367 --> 00:48:03,834
like this keynote,
I have all your attention!

1027
00:48:03,834 --> 00:48:05,533
The framework has
been set for the attention.

1028
00:48:05,533 --> 00:48:09,266
If this talk sucked, nothing
good was gonna happen for me.

1029
00:48:09,266 --> 00:48:10,033
Right?

1030
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:11,767
So really think
about the content,

1031
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:13,000
back to
Mallory's question right?

1032
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,633
What are you
actually putting out there?

1033
00:48:14,633 --> 00:48:16,200
Is it just
feature, feature, feature?

1034
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,166
Testimonials.

1035
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:21,266
You know like, oh let's talk
about the "Thank You Economy."

1036
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:23,633
I want to challenge everybody
here, thank you my friend,

1037
00:48:23,633 --> 00:48:25,233
appreciate it,
continued success.

1038
00:48:25,233 --> 00:48:28,567
I want to challenge
everybody here to a concept.

1039
00:48:28,567 --> 00:48:32,400
I call it the Jay Cutler
thesis, let me explain.

1040
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,133
(laughing) Some football fans.

1041
00:48:35,133 --> 00:48:37,367
So, I'm writing
the "Thank You Economy,"

1042
00:48:37,367 --> 00:48:39,600
it comes out in
2011, so in 2010,

1043
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,467
I asked my order
department at WineLibrary.com to

1044
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:46,633
search people's names on Google

1045
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:48,734
with the word Twitter after it.

1046
00:48:48,734 --> 00:48:51,233
So, based on when
somebody orders something.

1047
00:48:51,233 --> 00:48:54,433
So if Sally Thompson
ordered something, every order.

1048
00:48:54,433 --> 00:48:56,900
There was two people
internally that went online

1049
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,467
typed in Sally Thompson
Twitter, and that'd be hard

1050
00:48:59,467 --> 00:49:01,033
'cause there'd be
17 Sally Thompsons

1051
00:49:01,033 --> 00:49:02,567
could they figure out
if it's the right person?

1052
00:49:02,567 --> 00:49:04,100
Somebody like Gary
Vaynerchuk would've been great,

1053
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,200
one of a kind name.

1054
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,767
So we got some of those.

1055
00:49:06,767 --> 00:49:08,033
So we took some of those things

1056
00:49:08,033 --> 00:49:09,467
and then we
followed them on Twitter.

1057
00:49:09,467 --> 00:49:10,800
Want everybody to
pay attention to this

1058
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,066
'cause this
really works on Facebook.

1059
00:49:12,066 --> 00:49:14,066
This is the reason I
want every single transaction

1060
00:49:14,066 --> 00:49:16,533
you make, that
you figure out a way

1061
00:49:16,533 --> 00:49:19,000
to be following
that person on Facebook.

1062
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,200
Make it a business practice
that that's a prerequisite,

1063
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,467
or you do something for them,

1064
00:49:23,467 --> 00:49:25,667
make that relationship,
here's why.

1065
00:49:25,667 --> 00:49:27,000
Not them follow you,

1066
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,700
pay attention to how
much I reverse stuff.

1067
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,000
You follow them, let me explain.

1068
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,667
So we find this guy

1069
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:35,133
who places a $287 order

1070
00:49:35,133 --> 00:49:38,834
for a case of
Pinot Grigio to Chicago.

1071
00:49:38,834 --> 00:49:41,500
And we find him online,
unique name they find him.

1072
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:45,166
And every Tweet he puts
out is about Jay Cutler.

1073
00:49:45,166 --> 00:49:47,066
Jay Cutler you're the man.

1074
00:49:47,066 --> 00:49:49,233
Jay Cutler great pass.

1075
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:51,934
Jay Cutler what the
(hums) you know,

1076
00:49:51,934 --> 00:49:53,467
Jay Cutler this,
Jay Cutler that,

1077
00:49:53,467 --> 00:49:55,266
Jay Cutler this,
Jay Cutler that.

1078
00:49:55,266 --> 00:49:57,600
So, I keep getting
presented while I'm traveling,

1079
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,600
hey we found this,
this person's into surfing

1080
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,500
but not really.

1081
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,533
Oh we got somebody, this
guy's really into Jay Cutler.

1082
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:06,800
I go great, go on eBay and
buy a Jay Cutler signed jersey

1083
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,900
and send it to him
and write a note that says

1084
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:12,433
thank you for your business
at Wine Library, that's it.

1085
00:50:12,433 --> 00:50:13,533
And the person on
the other line goes

1086
00:50:13,533 --> 00:50:15,700
but he only bought a
$270 thing and we made

1087
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,967
$13 of profit, we're
a premium price leader.

1088
00:50:19,967 --> 00:50:20,934
I said uh huh.

1089
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:24,800
He goes okay, so we
bought a $330 Jay Cutler jersey

1090
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,867
and shipped it to
him signed, or 289.

1091
00:50:29,066 --> 00:50:31,233
And I'm pumped, I'm like this
person's gonna be blown away.

1092
00:50:31,233 --> 00:50:34,567
Right, they bought a
cocamanian case of Pino Grigio,

1093
00:50:34,567 --> 00:50:36,533
this is 2011,
right, he's gonna be like

1094
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,700
how the hell did they even know?

1095
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,000
I'm super pumped.

1096
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,834
And we sent four or five
other things, little things

1097
00:50:42,834 --> 00:50:44,400
not as extravagant.

1098
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,033
And some of those
people wrote back emails.

1099
00:50:46,033 --> 00:50:48,800
And this guy has not
written back for three weeks.

1100
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,900
And I'm like where the hell
is this son of a bitch, right?

1101
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,600
(audience laughter)

1102
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,300
And so I'm waiting and
I'm waiting and I'm waiting,

1103
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,900
and finally I'm
about to board a plane

1104
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,800
and I get a phone call and
they said, big, we got 'em.

1105
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,800
I'm like great.

1106
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,333
I'm like what did he do?

1107
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:06,400
They go, it's actually
a little bit different.

1108
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,367
I'm like go ahead.

1109
00:51:07,367 --> 00:51:11,033
They're like, we just
got a $4,800 burgundy order

1110
00:51:11,033 --> 00:51:12,867
from Plano, Texas.

1111
00:51:12,867 --> 00:51:14,333
I'm like great.

1112
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:15,600
What do you mean?

1113
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,000
They go let us read
you the note in the order.

1114
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,467
Hey Wine Library, first of
all, great burgundy selection.

1115
00:51:22,467 --> 00:51:24,400
This is insane, your
prices are incredible.

1116
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,533
Can you hold the order
'cause it's a little hot

1117
00:51:26,533 --> 00:51:29,300
right now in Texas, can
you ship it in the fall?

1118
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,467
P.S., you sent my friend John

1119
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:34,367
a Jay Cutler jersey,

1120
00:51:34,367 --> 00:51:37,133
that's how I became
aware of your website.

1121
00:51:37,133 --> 00:51:38,800
P.S.S.,

1122
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,433
I'm a huge
Bruce Springsteen fan.

1123
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:45,266
(audience laughter)

1124
00:51:48,133 --> 00:51:51,400
If your company,
whether it's you or an intern

1125
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,100
or a junior employee, is
following every single person

1126
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,367
that you've ever sold a
pool or spa or servicing

1127
00:51:58,367 --> 00:52:03,467
on Facebook, and they
see that that wife posts

1128
00:52:03,467 --> 00:52:05,867
that it's the first
day of nursery school

1129
00:52:05,867 --> 00:52:08,934
for their daughter
Charlotte, and you go

1130
00:52:08,934 --> 00:52:11,967
and send that person to Target
and buy some nice flowers

1131
00:52:11,967 --> 00:52:15,300
or gifts and bring it
to them and say congrats.

1132
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,200
Or you call them
on their birthday.

1133
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,333
Or you realize
they're a big sports fan

1134
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:20,734
and their team's
playing in the playoffs.

1135
00:52:20,734 --> 00:52:22,266
They're a Dolphins fan and
they're playing in the playoffs

1136
00:52:22,266 --> 00:52:25,266
for the first time in
15 years in the playoffs,

1137
00:52:25,266 --> 00:52:28,200
and you send them the
chicken wings and catering

1138
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,600
and say thank you
for their business.

1139
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,166
That word of mouth
will change your business.

1140
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:36,567
Because I'm a
salesman and I know

1141
00:52:36,567 --> 00:52:40,300
that after we make the sale,
we go hunting for the next one.

1142
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,300
And I know that in 1996,

1143
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,467
when you do something like that,

1144
00:52:45,467 --> 00:52:47,633
that those people
would always talk about you

1145
00:52:47,633 --> 00:52:48,633
and tell that story.

1146
00:52:48,633 --> 00:52:52,567
I know in 2017, those people
are gonna take four pictures

1147
00:52:52,567 --> 00:52:54,166
and put them on nine websites

1148
00:52:54,166 --> 00:52:57,133
and everybody in your town will
know that you're a business

1149
00:52:57,133 --> 00:53:01,233
with a little bit more
soul than the ability to fix

1150
00:53:01,233 --> 00:53:04,233
or sell them that
product or service.

1151
00:53:04,233 --> 00:53:08,800
This is the effort and the
uniqueness of using social media

1152
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,266
and digital media as a gateway
to create human interaction.

1153
00:53:13,266 --> 00:53:17,467
I use this as the first step

1154
00:53:17,467 --> 00:53:19,066
in my chess match

1155
00:53:19,066 --> 00:53:20,900
to shake your hand.

1156
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,633
Do you understand?

1157
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:26,066
So many of you think
this is replacing something,

1158
00:53:26,066 --> 00:53:28,433
when you don't
realize it became the gateway

1159
00:53:28,433 --> 00:53:30,500
to the next thing.

1160
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:34,567
10 years ago, it was super
weird to be dating somebody

1161
00:53:34,567 --> 00:53:37,200
you met on the internet.

1162
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:42,333
Today, every 20-year-old I know
swipes to the right and left

1163
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:44,767
20 hours a day.

1164
00:53:44,767 --> 00:53:48,166
So social norms change.

1165
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:51,300
There was a time
when Elvis shook his hips

1166
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,900
and grandmas and
moms all over this country

1167
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,800
thought he was the devil.

1168
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,300
Have you seen what
people are posting on Instagram?

1169
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,967
(audience laughter)

1170
00:54:00,967 --> 00:54:01,800
Questions?

1171
00:54:03,834 --> 00:54:06,934
There's one over here,
one over here.

1172
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:10,166
It's a race.

1173
00:54:13,734 --> 00:54:15,400
Okay, people are very close.

1174
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,166
Alright.

1175
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:18,367
- [Travis] So with all the
information--

1176
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,767
- What's your name?
- [Travis] Travis Hogan.

1177
00:54:19,767 --> 00:54:20,867
- Travis.
- [Travis] Fiesta Pools.

1178
00:54:20,867 --> 00:54:22,333
So where do you start?

1179
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:24,400
You name so 
many different things.

1180
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,633
Do you go home with content and
you have to make it relevant

1181
00:54:27,633 --> 00:54:28,867
that people want to watch

1182
00:54:28,867 --> 00:54:31,100
or else you're just like
every other person--

1183
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,033
- [Gary] So, Trav,
let's start from the beginning.

1184
00:54:33,033 --> 00:54:33,900
Keep, stay up.

1185
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,900
We'll use you to
really bring a ton of value.

1186
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,600
- [Travis] Great.

1187
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,467
(audience laughter)

1188
00:54:38,467 --> 00:54:40,934
- So Trav,
what are you doing now?

1189
00:54:40,934 --> 00:54:41,767
Anything?

1190
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:43,266
- We've done some Facebook ads.

1191
00:54:43,266 --> 00:54:45,367
I mean, to be honest,
not a whole lot.

1192
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:46,734
But we've done a few things.

1193
00:54:46,734 --> 00:54:48,333
So, Facebook ads,
we're doing Google ads.

1194
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:49,367
- [Gary] How much?

1195
00:54:49,367 --> 00:54:53,300
- 1,500 a month in
AdWords on Google

1196
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,166
and 500 on Facebook.

1197
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:57,567
- [Gary] And
what else do you do?

1198
00:54:57,567 --> 00:54:58,900
- We do some print.

1199
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,834
- [Gary] How much?
- Media direct.

1200
00:55:00,834 --> 00:55:02,834
Probably 10,000 a year.

1201
00:55:02,834 --> 00:55:04,133
Just in print.

1202
00:55:04,133 --> 00:55:05,900
- [Gary] Yep.

1203
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,233
- Other, word of mouth
is where we get a lot...

1204
00:55:09,233 --> 00:55:10,934
- [Gary] So how much marketing
dollars do you spend a year,

1205
00:55:10,934 --> 00:55:11,767
you think?

1206
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:13,734
- Probably 40,000, 50,000.

1207
00:55:13,734 --> 00:55:17,667
- And so the
rest is word of mouth.

1208
00:55:17,667 --> 00:55:18,633
That's really
driving the business, right?

1209
00:55:18,633 --> 00:55:19,433
- [Travis] Correct.

1210
00:55:19,433 --> 00:55:20,767
- So look, very honestly, man?

1211
00:55:20,767 --> 00:55:22,333
Trav, I think
first and foremost,

1212
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:24,066
how many customers
have you had in the history

1213
00:55:24,066 --> 00:55:25,367
of your business?

1214
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:26,166
- Say it again, I'm sorry.

1215
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:27,767
- [Gary] How many customers
have you had in the history

1216
00:55:27,767 --> 00:55:28,867
of your business?

1217
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,133
- Probably 10,000.

1218
00:55:30,133 --> 00:55:31,400
- [Gary] Do you have the data?

1219
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,867
- A lot of it, yes.

1220
00:55:32,867 --> 00:55:34,800
- [Gary] Yeah, I would really,
really latch on to the

1221
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,233
last thing I just did.

1222
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:38,200
First of all, with
that limited a budget,

1223
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,133
I wanna
maximize sweat, not cash.

1224
00:55:41,133 --> 00:55:44,133
So let's go back and
look at those 10,000 people.

1225
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:46,033
If I bought into your business
and I was a new partner,

1226
00:55:46,033 --> 00:55:48,266
obviously you'd be like "Hey,
Gary, you do the marketing."

1227
00:55:48,266 --> 00:55:49,867
I'm like "No shit, Trav."

1228
00:55:49,867 --> 00:55:53,133
(Travis and audience laughter)

1229
00:55:53,133 --> 00:55:53,867
- Yes.

1230
00:55:53,867 --> 00:55:57,734
- So I would say of the 50,000,
I'd probably spend 15,000

1231
00:55:57,734 --> 00:55:59,767
on thank you economy, right?

1232
00:55:59,767 --> 00:56:01,700
I'd probably get an intern,

1233
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,500
because people always
want to work and learn.

1234
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,967
Intern to do
Facebook and Twitter data.

1235
00:56:05,967 --> 00:56:08,867
You'll find
somebody, if you try.

1236
00:56:08,867 --> 00:56:11,834
An intern, very
low cost, to reach out

1237
00:56:11,834 --> 00:56:14,934
and follow all 10,000 people.

1238
00:56:14,934 --> 00:56:16,400
All of them, I mean it.

1239
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,300
It's gonna take
the whole summer.

1240
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,266
- [Travis] So do
you friend them?

1241
00:56:18,266 --> 00:56:19,667
- [Gary] Uh-huh.
- Alright.

1242
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:21,300
- [Gary] And you friend
them as your business,

1243
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,867
so you have to have a
business page, not you.

1244
00:56:22,867 --> 00:56:23,700
- [Travis] Yeah, got it.

1245
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,133
- 'Cause, I mean, what's Trav
up to, you know what I mean?

1246
00:56:25,133 --> 00:56:26,633
And so--

1247
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:27,500
- [Travis] (laughs)
Hashtag creepy?

1248
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,633
- Yeah.

1249
00:56:28,633 --> 00:56:30,900
(audience laughter)

1250
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,200
Can you zoom in on the beard?

1251
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:38,066
And so of those 10,000,

1252
00:56:39,467 --> 00:56:42,033
847 will accept your friendship.

1253
00:56:42,033 --> 00:56:43,433
First of all, of those 10,000,

1254
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:47,133
6,900 are still
there inactive, so 894.

1255
00:56:47,133 --> 00:56:48,133
And those 894...

1256
00:56:48,133 --> 00:56:49,734
And probably
work backwards, right?

1257
00:56:49,734 --> 00:56:52,633
I would attack heavily
everybody in the last 18 months,

1258
00:56:52,633 --> 00:56:53,867
because it's still fresh.

1259
00:56:53,867 --> 00:56:55,934
How long you been in business?

1260
00:56:55,934 --> 00:56:57,066
- 60 years.

1261
00:56:57,066 --> 00:56:57,900
- [Gary] Jesus.

1262
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:58,734
- Yeah, I had to stop and think.

1263
00:56:58,734 --> 00:57:00,734
- Yeah.

1264
00:57:00,734 --> 00:57:02,500
Let me reframe it,
let's restructure.

1265
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,100
The last two years,
every customer,

1266
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,166
follow them on Facebook

1267
00:57:05,166 --> 00:57:10,300
and then spend $10,000
on surprise and delight.

1268
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,433
You know?

1269
00:57:11,433 --> 00:57:13,600
The other thing you can
do while they're doing that

1270
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,633
is you should go to
every local business in town

1271
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,400
and try to make biz dev deals.

1272
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,200
Be like, you go to a
local business, the barber,

1273
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,333
and be like "Listen, I know
this is gonna sound weird.

1274
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:25,700
"I was in Louisiana
and there's this weird guy,

1275
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:28,333
"he gave a talk and he made
me do this, so bear with me.

1276
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:32,300
"I want to surprise some of
my clients with your services.

1277
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,667
"I think this could be a
great word of mouth for you.

1278
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:36,867
"Are you willing to
give me five free haircuts?"

1279
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:38,133
Let me save you time.

1280
00:57:38,133 --> 00:57:39,767
He or she's gonna say yes.

1281
00:57:39,767 --> 00:57:42,233
So now all of a sudden,
we're gonna get $40,000 worth

1282
00:57:42,233 --> 00:57:46,100
of services for, you might
not even have to spend 10,000.

1283
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,533
Remember when I said
what I talk about is hard?

1284
00:57:48,533 --> 00:57:50,433
This is the 
"House of Cards" part.

1285
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:52,200
This is the 
"Call of Duty" part.

1286
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,200
This is the you want
your business to grow

1287
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,767
but you're on four
goddamn softball teams.

1288
00:57:57,767 --> 00:57:58,600
Right?

1289
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,066
So this is what I would do.

1290
00:58:00,066 --> 00:58:03,300
The rest, then, I would
do is reach out to people

1291
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,900
in your community
that are making content.

1292
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,433
So it's searched on
Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube

1293
00:58:08,433 --> 00:58:10,233
of young kids and other actors.

1294
00:58:10,233 --> 00:58:11,233
Where do you live?

1295
00:58:11,233 --> 00:58:12,066
- Tulsa.

1296
00:58:12,066 --> 00:58:14,700
- Great. Plenty,
plenty of content producers.

1297
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,433
See if some of them
want to make the funny videos

1298
00:58:17,433 --> 00:58:18,600
or the interesting videos.

1299
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,133
Drive the costs down.

1300
00:58:20,133 --> 00:58:23,033
And then I would
save the last $30,000,

1301
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:27,967
20,000 of it on Facebook
ads against that content

1302
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:30,934
in the local area, against
high net worth individuals

1303
00:58:30,934 --> 00:58:33,700
that can afford the
products and services.

1304
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,367
- [Travis] Thank you.
- [Gary] You got it.

1305
00:58:35,367 --> 00:58:36,200
- Yeah.

1306
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,367
- [Peter] So, I
work for BioLab as well.

1307
00:58:37,367 --> 00:58:38,200
- Great.

1308
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,500
- What role can we--
- [Gary] What's your name?

1309
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,333
- Peter.
- [Gary] Peter.

1310
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:41,166
- Nice to meet you.

1311
00:58:41,166 --> 00:58:42,000
- [Gary] Nice to meet you man.

1312
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,033
- What role can we play to
help Travis and all the other

1313
00:58:44,033 --> 00:58:46,367
dealers do that,
because we have scale, right?

1314
00:58:46,367 --> 00:58:49,000
We should be able to help them
venture into these channels.

1315
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,867
- [Gary] You know it's funny,
we were talking back stage.

1316
00:58:51,867 --> 00:58:53,533
Vayner, my company,
we've gone from

1317
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:57,400
zero to 100 million
in revenue in six years.

1318
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,800
What happened is, now we're
only able to work with the

1319
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,767
biggest companies in the world

1320
00:59:00,767 --> 00:59:01,967
because we're
fancy and expensive.

1321
00:59:01,967 --> 00:59:04,767
Over the holiday,
I'm like, "This sucks."

1322
00:59:04,767 --> 00:59:08,033
I want to help
people that I'm like,

1323
00:59:08,033 --> 00:59:10,233
so I've spent
the last six months,

1324
00:59:10,233 --> 00:59:12,066
and we're just
about to roll it out,

1325
00:59:12,066 --> 00:59:14,667
of a program that is
somewhere in the ballpark of

1326
00:59:14,667 --> 00:59:18,800
$350,000 to
$400,000 a year, you know.

1327
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,900
I want to start
working with more companies

1328
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,867
that look like you guys
because if you then start

1329
00:59:22,867 --> 00:59:27,100
doing better actions like this
with your marketing dollars

1330
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,934
then you can start using them
as case studies to show them

1331
00:59:29,934 --> 00:59:34,266
and I want to make you do
the scaling the un-scalable.

1332
00:59:34,266 --> 00:59:35,800
We have to remember,
what you're doing

1333
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,533
they may not
have the budget for,

1334
00:59:37,533 --> 00:59:39,967
so it's not that I
want the 350 for anything

1335
00:59:39,967 --> 00:59:41,400
other than amplification.

1336
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,633
We're still going to do the
same kind of stuff as well,

1337
00:59:43,633 --> 00:59:46,166
but I think the
number one, it's parenting.

1338
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:50,367
The best way to parent
is set an actual example.

1339
00:59:51,266 --> 00:59:53,667
- [Peter] Good deal, thank you.
- Cool.

1340
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:56,000
My friend, oh hey, how are you?

1341
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,834
- [Angela] Good.
- What's your name?

1342
00:59:56,834 --> 00:59:57,667
- Angela.
- Angela.

1343
00:59:57,667 --> 00:59:58,600
- [Angela] From 
upstate New York.

1344
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,033
- Awesome.

1345
01:00:00,033 --> 01:00:04,700
- Our biggest social
media concern is reviews.

1346
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,033
- [Gary] That's not a
concern, it's uncontrollable.

1347
01:00:07,033 --> 01:00:07,867
- Right.

1348
01:00:07,867 --> 01:00:08,834
- [Gary] Go to
Glassdoor right now

1349
01:00:08,834 --> 01:00:10,433
and everybody I've
ever fired at VaynerMedia

1350
01:00:10,433 --> 01:00:12,834
says I'm the worst piece
of crap they've ever met.

1351
01:00:12,834 --> 01:00:15,567
- Right, so how do you respond?

1352
01:00:15,567 --> 01:00:16,867
- [Gary] I don't.

1353
01:00:16,867 --> 01:00:18,233
- You just leave it blank?

1354
01:00:18,233 --> 01:00:20,066
- Because anybody who's smart

1355
01:00:20,066 --> 01:00:22,200
in the world, especially
if they're going to buy

1356
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,200
a product and
service that costs something

1357
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,200
is going to take an anonymous
review with a grain of salt.

1358
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,800
So how do I do it?

1359
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,867
I think that most people when
they think about reviews,

1360
01:00:31,867 --> 01:00:34,767
become ostriches and
put their head in the sand.

1361
01:00:34,767 --> 01:00:36,600
What I try to do is become

1362
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,500
Loyola Marymount
basketball 1992.

1363
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,767
I know that's very nerdy.

1364
01:00:40,767 --> 01:00:45,066
I'm trying to win
the game 147 to 132.

1365
01:00:45,066 --> 01:00:46,934
The biggest reason
you need to get louder

1366
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:48,200
is if you don't get loud,

1367
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,700
somebody else is
going to be loud for you.

1368
01:00:52,667 --> 01:00:53,700
- [Angela] Okay.

1369
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:54,867
- [Gary] I can leave
a negative review for

1370
01:00:54,867 --> 01:00:57,133
every one of you right now.

1371
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:02,834
- [Angela] Alright,
that's it then.

1372
01:01:02,834 --> 01:01:04,100
(audience laughter)

1373
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,967
- So, you know, I'm
doing that for effect

1374
01:01:05,967 --> 01:01:08,834
because it was funny,
but the real punchline is

1375
01:01:08,834 --> 01:01:10,667
people are going
to leave reviews.

1376
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,300
What do you think,
just by not being active

1377
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,734
on the internet, people are
just going to not write reviews?

1378
01:01:14,734 --> 01:01:16,633
People have written reviews.

1379
01:01:16,633 --> 01:01:17,600
So what's the punchline here?

1380
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,567
- [Man] Should you
be pushing people

1381
01:01:18,567 --> 01:01:19,533
to review you though?

1382
01:01:19,533 --> 01:01:21,233
- I mean, I think when
you do the right ac,

1383
01:01:21,233 --> 01:01:23,200
I think when you buy
somebody chicken wings

1384
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,300
to watch a football game,
they might leave a review.

1385
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,100
- [Man] For sure.

1386
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,900
- You know, I think
whenever you ask for something

1387
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,367
it's not as pure as if
it would have happened.

1388
01:01:30,367 --> 01:01:33,400
Sure, again, this is the
beauty of having retention.

1389
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,266
This is why again,
I'm a businessman,

1390
01:01:36,266 --> 01:01:38,367
I happen to be
good at marketing.

1391
01:01:38,367 --> 01:01:41,266
If you're not deploying
services on top of your sales,

1392
01:01:41,266 --> 01:01:42,400
it's just not smart.

1393
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,400
You're leaving so
much money on the table.

1394
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,800
So first, I would do that
and then I would find ways

1395
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,400
to be in touch with those
people as often as possible

1396
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,533
and then not just when you're
asking them for goddamn money.

1397
01:01:54,533 --> 01:01:58,500
You're super in
touch when you want cash.

1398
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,700
How about when something
big in their life happened?

1399
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,900
How about actually
building a relationship?

1400
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:07,667
My friends, as
we go more Jetsons,

1401
01:02:07,667 --> 01:02:11,967
the people that act like the
Flintstones are going to win.

1402
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:15,367
Your grandparents
are more theoretically

1403
01:02:15,367 --> 01:02:19,000
prepared for
social media than you are,

1404
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,333
because they
invented the baker's dozen.

1405
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:23,200
They invented when
you walked into the shop

1406
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,633
they started
cutting your roast beef

1407
01:02:24,633 --> 01:02:26,166
because they knew who you were.

1408
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:27,967
They invented
coming over your house

1409
01:02:27,967 --> 01:02:30,867
and giving you a cake
when your grandmother died.

1410
01:02:30,867 --> 01:02:35,467
Now you have technology
and you can scale that.

1411
01:02:35,467 --> 01:02:38,767
Can we please deploy some soul

1412
01:02:38,767 --> 01:02:41,100
and scale it?

1413
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,200
My friend back there?

1414
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,500
Yes, let's get him a mic.

1415
01:02:50,033 --> 01:02:51,333
- How are you, my friend?

1416
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:53,734
- Pretty good, Russ Michael,
DMV Pools, New York.

1417
01:02:53,734 --> 01:02:54,700
- [Gary] Very Nice.

1418
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,567
- Two-part question.
- [Gary] Please.

1419
01:02:56,567 --> 01:02:57,900
- Blogs.
- [Gary] Blogs.

1420
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,867
- They were very big.
- [Gary] Yes.

1421
01:02:59,867 --> 01:03:01,533
- But you're pushing video.

1422
01:03:01,533 --> 01:03:02,433
- [Gary] I am.

1423
01:03:02,433 --> 01:03:02,967
- Okay.

1424
01:03:02,967 --> 01:03:07,133
- MASH used to be the
number one show on television.

1425
01:03:07,133 --> 01:03:08,934
- [Russ] Okay.
(audience laughter)

1426
01:03:08,934 --> 01:03:11,367
Regarding content on the videos.

1427
01:03:11,367 --> 01:03:13,367
Lots of our
vendors are producing them.

1428
01:03:13,367 --> 01:03:15,633
You're saying to
do it on your own.

1429
01:03:15,633 --> 01:03:16,734
- [Gary] Correct.

1430
01:03:16,734 --> 01:03:18,400
- Home-grown, ignore that.

1431
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,800
- [Gary] Yes, I mean,
you don't ignore it.

1432
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,967
Maybe when you
get really to a scale

1433
01:03:21,967 --> 01:03:24,266
where you may have a
video person that knows

1434
01:03:24,266 --> 01:03:25,800
what to do with it,
maybe they can take that,

1435
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,734
edit pieces out, but if you're
putting out the same content

1436
01:03:27,734 --> 01:03:29,934
that everybody else is putting
out, 'cause you're all lazy,

1437
01:03:29,934 --> 01:03:32,166
and you're just
pushing republish,

1438
01:03:32,166 --> 01:03:34,000
you're not
differentiating yourself.

1439
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,800
- [Russ] Okay,
all right, thank you.

1440
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,300
- [Gary] You're welcome.

1441
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,333
More of that, please, by the
way, that was super helpful.

1442
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:44,266
It's very unusual for me to
have this much Q&amp;A time.

1443
01:03:44,266 --> 01:03:46,066
It's a great way for
me to start the year.

1444
01:03:46,066 --> 01:03:49,433
By the way, I audited a lot
of the businesses in here.

1445
01:03:49,433 --> 01:03:52,266
Nobody should be
shy, you all suck.

1446
01:03:52,266 --> 01:03:55,200
(audience laughter)

1447
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,834
Hey.

1448
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:59,934
- James Robyn from Rin
Robyn Pools in New Jersey.

1449
01:03:59,934 --> 01:04:00,934
- [Gary] Where?

1450
01:04:00,934 --> 01:04:02,367
- Bernardsville
and Hackettstown.

1451
01:04:02,367 --> 01:04:05,867
- [Gary] Very cool, my
sister lives in Basking Ridge.

1452
01:04:05,867 --> 01:04:06,700
- Great.
- [Gary] Let's make a deal.

1453
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,166
- [James] Does she have a pool?

1454
01:04:08,166 --> 01:04:09,467
- No, she's got a townhouse.

1455
01:04:09,467 --> 01:04:11,133
- Does she want a pool?

1456
01:04:11,133 --> 01:04:13,200
- [Gary] She does, but she
needs to hustle a little more.

1457
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:17,300
- Okay, not
directly in social media,

1458
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,767
but I'm sure everybody in
this room has been approached

1459
01:04:19,767 --> 01:04:23,633
by folks like
HomeAdvisor and Angie's List.

1460
01:04:23,633 --> 01:04:24,633
- [Gary] Sure.

1461
01:04:24,633 --> 01:04:27,467
- I have my opinion,
I'm interested in yours.

1462
01:04:27,467 --> 01:04:29,367
- I think that they
are taking advantage

1463
01:04:29,367 --> 01:04:31,700
of your lack of knowledge,
and are arbitraging you

1464
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:34,433
out of your own customer,
and are sitting in the middle,

1465
01:04:34,433 --> 01:04:36,166
and eventually will
have tons of leverage,

1466
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:38,667
and will cut into your margin.

1467
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,667
And so I think you're all
collectively digitally lazy,

1468
01:04:43,667 --> 01:04:47,066
and so you're
giving away the real value.

1469
01:04:47,934 --> 01:04:49,333
What do you think?

1470
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:51,867
- Oh, I think they're
a total rip-off, yeah.

1471
01:04:51,867 --> 01:04:53,300
- So what I want is--

1472
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,100
- [James] I would
not participate at all.

1473
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,867
- And I don't think they're
a total rip-off, I don't.

1474
01:04:57,867 --> 01:05:00,133
You know, I have empathy for
why you would think that,

1475
01:05:00,133 --> 01:05:02,800
I just think, Jesus,
you own your own business.

1476
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,367
Why don't you work harder,
understand what you have to do,

1477
01:05:05,367 --> 01:05:09,333
to not rely on that drug.

1478
01:05:09,333 --> 01:05:11,600
That's how I feel about Google.

1479
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,500
What do you think
Google's gonna do?

1480
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,300
You think Google cares about
your business in Bernardsville?

1481
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:18,066
I think this is
ridiculous, what we're doing.

1482
01:05:18,066 --> 01:05:20,100
We have an
opportunity to build our brand.

1483
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:23,000
The reason I want your content
is, I wanna see your face.

1484
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,500
Or, whoever you decide, right?

1485
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,000
The thing that 
is not commoditize-able,

1486
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:28,934
that's the key.

1487
01:05:28,934 --> 01:05:31,633
So absolutely, they're
arbing you in-between.

1488
01:05:31,633 --> 01:05:34,734
Do you know how OpenTable
built its restaurant business?

1489
01:05:34,734 --> 01:05:37,967
They took advantage of
restaurant, they make money.

1490
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:40,233
The reason they charge
one dollar, so OpenTable,

1491
01:05:40,233 --> 01:05:42,667
has anybody used OpenTable
to book a restaurant, great.

1492
01:05:42,667 --> 01:05:45,100
OpenTable charges those
restaurants a dollar

1493
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:45,834
when you book.

1494
01:05:45,834 --> 01:05:50,300
Right, but it costs them 90
cents to get you on Google.

1495
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:53,467
It's their customer,
it's their customer.

1496
01:05:53,467 --> 01:05:56,967
You Googled one tree
restaurant to book it,

1497
01:05:56,967 --> 01:05:59,633
but because a
OpenTable ad shows up first,

1498
01:05:59,633 --> 01:06:02,900
you booked it through OpenTable.

1499
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:07,200
So they became a toll
booth for their customer.

1500
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,633
Are you kidding me?

1501
01:06:09,867 --> 01:06:11,033
I'm pissed.

1502
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:14,500
(audience laughter)

1503
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:15,867
So that's the scoop there.

1504
01:06:15,867 --> 01:06:16,700
Questions?

1505
01:06:18,233 --> 01:06:21,133
Let's do it,
let's keep this goin'.

1506
01:06:22,633 --> 01:06:24,500
By the way, as I'm thinking,

1507
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,700
before we get this
question, Twitter search.

1508
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,667
If you wanna write down
something very fascinating,

1509
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:33,100
if you go to twitter.com/search,
you can search pool terms,

1510
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,800
home terms, the words,
putting in a pool,

1511
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:38,767
sentences even, the word pool,
and then you can search

1512
01:06:38,767 --> 01:06:42,367
within a five or 10-mile
radius of your zip code

1513
01:06:42,367 --> 01:06:45,433
and then you can see everything
people are saying about,

1514
01:06:45,433 --> 01:06:47,133
literally, people
will say things like,

1515
01:06:47,133 --> 01:06:49,200
thinking about
putting in a pool this year.

1516
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,934
This is the
world we live in now.

1517
01:06:50,934 --> 01:06:52,300
They will actually tweet that.

1518
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,400
Now, remember
what I said earlier.

1519
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,000
Don't do the 
17-year-old dude move.

1520
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,934
Don't just jump in
and be like, I sell pools.

1521
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:04,533
Right, romance
the girl a little bit.

1522
01:07:04,533 --> 01:07:05,500
Try to provide them value.

1523
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,333
What kind, do you
have the yard structure?

1524
01:07:07,333 --> 01:07:09,700
You know, some of those things
that you give away for free.

1525
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,333
Then they trust, and
you become the person

1526
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:13,767
that they decide to go with.

1527
01:07:13,767 --> 01:07:17,133
So twitter.com/search, search
the terms that you guys know

1528
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:18,967
from a maintenance,
I'm not an expert,

1529
01:07:18,967 --> 01:07:20,800
I'm sure there's terms
for some of the pipes

1530
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,834
and different things,
not just the word, pool,

1531
01:07:22,834 --> 01:07:24,600
'cause you get a lot of
things like, in the pool,

1532
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,600
and that's not gonna
do you anything, right?

1533
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,467
Search within your mile radius,

1534
01:07:28,467 --> 01:07:30,600
so that's the advanced search.

1535
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,133
When you search
terms, you'll get results,

1536
01:07:32,133 --> 01:07:34,667
you'll see an advanced
search in there, you know,

1537
01:07:34,667 --> 01:07:36,734
put in your zip code,
put in a mile radius,

1538
01:07:36,734 --> 01:07:38,467
and then just read
what people are saying.

1539
01:07:38,467 --> 01:07:40,066
This is no different than if

1540
01:07:40,066 --> 01:07:42,500
you were sitting at the
park and somebody was talking

1541
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,166
and saying, yeah,
thinking about getting a pool.

1542
01:07:44,166 --> 01:07:45,633
And you be like,
excuse me, you know.

1543
01:07:45,633 --> 01:07:47,467
And on Twitter, it's accepted.

1544
01:07:47,467 --> 01:07:50,667
Creeper, on Facebook.

1545
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:52,900
On Twitter, it's an
open forum, so it's accepted.

1546
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,133
So you jumping in,

1547
01:07:54,133 --> 01:07:56,834
just have the right
cadence to bring value first.

1548
01:07:56,834 --> 01:07:58,900
They're gonna know what
you are, they're gonna look

1549
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,767
at your profile and
know that you sell it.

1550
01:08:00,767 --> 01:08:05,767
You don't have to tell 'em,
you're wearing the t-shirt.

1551
01:08:05,767 --> 01:08:07,000
- Yes, hey, man.
What's your name?

1552
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,800
- [Mark] Hi, my name's Mark,
I'm from Nova Scotia, Canada.

1553
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,166
- Very nice.
- With the video content,

1554
01:08:12,166 --> 01:08:13,300
what have you learned in terms

1555
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:15,100
of the length of
content that's applicable?

1556
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,133
Are you lookin'
for a 30-second teaser,

1557
01:08:17,133 --> 01:08:18,767
that then gets
into three minutes?

1558
01:08:18,767 --> 01:08:20,734
What's the target
in terms of length?

1559
01:08:20,734 --> 01:08:21,734
- [Gary] It's a great question,
thank you.

1560
01:08:21,734 --> 01:08:24,100
So, the conventional
wisdom in my world,

1561
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,966
it's seems like
you're asking a question

1562
01:08:25,966 --> 01:08:29,800
with a little bit of data,
is shorter is better,

1563
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,500
and I don't believe that.

1564
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:35,600
So, I believe that if
Stars Wars' next film came out

1565
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,033
and it was seven
hours and 13 seconds,

1566
01:08:38,033 --> 01:08:39,466
people would watch it.

1567
01:08:39,466 --> 01:08:42,899
And I know that when
Vine was hot for six seconds,

1568
01:08:42,899 --> 01:08:44,133
I looked at data
that showed plenty

1569
01:08:44,133 --> 01:08:46,800
of people would stop
watching after three.

1570
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,300
So, I would say, whatever
message you're trying to say,

1571
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,332
that's the beauty of
it not being a commercial,

1572
01:08:52,332 --> 01:08:54,433
where you bought 30
seconds worth of time.

1573
01:08:54,433 --> 01:08:58,734
If what you have to say is gonna
take 16 seconds, mazel tov.

1574
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:01,800
If it's gonna take four
minutes and 10 seconds, great.

1575
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,000
So, I have videos on
Facebook that do extremely well

1576
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,100
that are an
hour and a half long,

1577
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,800
but no question, when
I can find those moments

1578
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,166
for a minute or two,
there's absolutely

1579
01:09:11,166 --> 01:09:14,066
a little bit more upside
in the one to two minutes.

1580
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:18,367
But those 60 minute keynotes
are very valuable, too.

1581
01:09:18,367 --> 01:09:20,500
So, it just depends,
and I would say,

1582
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,332
you should produce enough
content that does all things,

1583
01:09:23,332 --> 01:09:26,633
and you'll learn
what works for you.

1584
01:09:26,633 --> 01:09:30,233
Video, look,
nothing has changed.

1585
01:09:30,233 --> 01:09:33,300
Human behavior is just
adjusting to new platforms.

1586
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:36,265
TV and movie stars were
always bigger than authors.

1587
01:09:36,265 --> 01:09:39,567
So, if you can do video,
it's real powerful.

1588
01:09:39,567 --> 01:09:41,300
- [Mark] Great, thanks.
- You got it.

1589
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:42,934
Questions? Very
good, here we go.

1590
01:09:42,934 --> 01:09:44,633
Yes.

1591
01:09:44,633 --> 01:09:45,567
Hey, man.

1592
01:09:45,567 --> 01:09:47,500
- [Bob] Bob Davis from Virginia.

1593
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:50,000
- Hey, Bob.

1594
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,300
- I'm wondering, a lot of
the information that I've,

1595
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:57,800
a lot of what I've seen from
you is a lot of brief stuff.

1596
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:58,700
- [Gary] On Facebook?

1597
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,233
- Yeah, I've listened to you
for about four or five years.

1598
01:10:01,233 --> 01:10:03,066
- [Gary] Thank you.
- Anyway,

1599
01:10:03,066 --> 01:10:05,633
what's the
future of the website?

1600
01:10:05,633 --> 01:10:08,500
- [Gary] That's a good question.

1601
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,433
I still think you need
a home on the internet,

1602
01:10:10,433 --> 01:10:13,233
so I'm pretty
bullish on the website still.

1603
01:10:13,233 --> 01:10:16,033
I'm just sad when
I meet new businesses,

1604
01:10:16,033 --> 01:10:17,633
or talk to friends
or small businesses,

1605
01:10:17,633 --> 01:10:21,400
or even corporations
that overspend on the website.

1606
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:25,000
So, to me, thinking about
the businesses in this room,

1607
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,166
I think with
Squarespace and WordPress like

1608
01:10:28,166 --> 01:10:31,600
for what you actually do, you
could really honestly get away

1609
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,000
with probably between
five and 25,000 all in

1610
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,734
and be in an amazing place,
probably even less in some ways.

1611
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:41,066
So, I do think that
you don't ever want to,

1612
01:10:41,066 --> 01:10:43,166
just like in Angie's List,
I don't wanna be at the mercy

1613
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:48,266
of Facebook, or Instagram,
or Snapchat, or Youtube,

1614
01:10:48,266 --> 01:10:51,200
but I wanna extract the value
of attention while I'm there.

1615
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,600
And I wanna push them to my
brand, first and foremost,

1616
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,000
so that it's remembered, but
the website is a good place

1617
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,433
to collect data to
put out the information.

1618
01:11:00,433 --> 01:11:02,500
But it is stunning
to watch how many people

1619
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,533
now are making a
decision on business.

1620
01:11:04,533 --> 01:11:06,567
The amount of people
in this room, my friend,

1621
01:11:06,567 --> 01:11:09,133
who've lost
business last season,

1622
01:11:09,133 --> 01:11:12,467
because their Instagram and
Facebook seem like crickets

1623
01:11:12,467 --> 01:11:14,800
or they were out of
business, is stunning.

1624
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,166
It is becoming the
place that people go first

1625
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:19,066
to make decisions,
not just the website.

1626
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:21,166
But I do not
believe the website is dead,

1627
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:23,533
I still think it
needs to be maintained.

1628
01:11:23,533 --> 01:11:24,867
If people here have a website

1629
01:11:24,867 --> 01:11:26,633
that they built
11, 12 years ago,

1630
01:11:26,633 --> 01:11:28,567
it'd probably be
smart to refresh it

1631
01:11:28,567 --> 01:11:30,200
a little bit to feel relevant.

1632
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,800
I think it's more
of a branding thing.

1633
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,734
And from a
functionality standpoint,

1634
01:11:33,734 --> 01:11:36,500
a Facebook ad that has
your phone number in it

1635
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:39,400
that you spend $5,000 a year
on is gonna do a lot more

1636
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,400
than the phone
number on your website.

1637
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:45,934
So, I'm still into it,
but it's clearly,

1638
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:47,333
it's an evolving
thing, but I do believe

1639
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:49,100
there's still value in it.

1640
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,233
Do you have any
followup for that?

1641
01:11:51,233 --> 01:11:54,166
- [Bob] Well, it seems like the
biggest activity that we get

1642
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:58,800
on our website is
people will call and say,

1643
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,633
"Hey, I read what
you wrote about a pool

1644
01:12:00,633 --> 01:12:03,066
"or a hot tub or something."

1645
01:12:03,066 --> 01:12:04,066
I was in the
store the other day,

1646
01:12:04,066 --> 01:12:05,200
and a guy
actually told me, he said,

1647
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:08,967
"Yeah, I read what you wrote
on the website about hot tubs."

1648
01:12:08,967 --> 01:12:10,066
I was like, "That's cool."

1649
01:12:10,066 --> 01:12:11,367
- [Gary] It's real, man.

1650
01:12:11,367 --> 01:12:12,700
- Yeah, and so I think--

1651
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,567
- [Gary] You know, to me,
literally, if like we

1652
01:12:14,567 --> 01:12:16,500
were jammin'
together, I'd be like,

1653
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,834
"Hey, let's make the
phone number bigger."

1654
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:20,433
It's amazing
some of these things,

1655
01:12:20,433 --> 01:12:22,667
these subtle little tweaks,
but I agree with you.

1656
01:12:22,667 --> 01:12:24,166
You know, even
before you said that,

1657
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:26,800
notice how I used the
phone number, Facebook ad.

1658
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,100
I just know what's going,
I see it, it's not I'm genius,

1659
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:30,800
I'm putting in the
work 18 hours a day

1660
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,867
to watch the behavior of
consumers on the internet.

1661
01:12:32,867 --> 01:12:35,500
So, yeah, I would triple
down on the phone number.

1662
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:36,967
And then you
know what I would do,

1663
01:12:36,967 --> 01:12:38,900
who's getting the phone calls?

1664
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:42,166
- Well, we have different
phone numbers on the site,

1665
01:12:42,166 --> 01:12:44,533
but my name is by my cell phone.

1666
01:12:44,533 --> 01:12:46,800
As long as somebody doesn't
call me yellin' and screamin',

1667
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,100
cussin' mad, I'll talk
to anyone anytime of day.

1668
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,700
And the truth is,
I rarely get called.

1669
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:56,367
But when I do get called, it's
usually for something good.

1670
01:12:56,367 --> 01:12:58,033
But listening to
you standing here,

1671
01:12:58,033 --> 01:13:00,767
it occurs to me that probably
one of the greatest values

1672
01:13:00,767 --> 01:13:04,200
or the best uses of my website
could be to tell the story.

1673
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:09,266
Because sales
happen from a good story.

1674
01:13:09,266 --> 01:13:10,266
- [Gary] That's exactly right.

1675
01:13:10,266 --> 01:13:12,633
- And then inform
people about our people

1676
01:13:12,633 --> 01:13:14,667
and tell a few
stories about that.

1677
01:13:14,667 --> 01:13:15,834
- [Gary] You beat me to it.

1678
01:13:15,834 --> 01:13:17,400
What I would have done,
my website--

1679
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,033
- [Bob] Rah rah.

1680
01:13:19,033 --> 01:13:21,333
- I would have a phone
number, I would have two

1681
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:23,967
or three videos, and
then what I would make

1682
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,600
in that video is I
would reverse engineer

1683
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,166
the biggest themes
of the phone calls.

1684
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:31,367
So, the reason I was asking
you who gets the phone calls,

1685
01:13:31,367 --> 01:13:34,367
I'd love to know by breakdown,

1686
01:13:34,367 --> 01:13:35,800
like having them
start documenting

1687
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:39,066
the content of the phone call.

1688
01:13:39,066 --> 01:13:41,500
Because that,
I think, is so valuable

1689
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,233
because then you
just reverse engineer

1690
01:13:43,233 --> 01:13:44,200
what they're
actually looking for.

1691
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,867
And if you're seeing
seven out of 11 calls focusing

1692
01:13:46,867 --> 01:13:50,300
in on this, you
storytell against that.

1693
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,166
- [Bob] Thanks.

1694
01:13:51,166 --> 01:13:53,000
- You got it, brother.

1695
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,667
Questions?

1696
01:13:55,667 --> 01:13:56,467
Oh, great.

1697
01:13:56,467 --> 01:13:57,500
Stand up.

1698
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,667
- [Kara] Okay.
- What's your name?

1699
01:13:58,667 --> 01:13:59,367
- [Kara] I'm Kara.
- Kara.

1700
01:13:59,367 --> 01:14:01,500
- [Kara] Wichita, Kansas.
- Very nice.

1701
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,367
- We do Facebook,
Twitter, and all of that

1702
01:14:03,367 --> 01:14:05,133
but we haven't
done an Instagram yet

1703
01:14:05,133 --> 01:14:08,000
and I think.

1704
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,333
Do you normally for a
business just feature products

1705
01:14:11,333 --> 01:14:13,300
or how do you get started in?

1706
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,567
- [Gary] Yeah, so you should A,
definitely do Instagram.

1707
01:14:15,567 --> 01:14:16,400
- [Kara] Yeah.

1708
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,033
- So much of the
decision maker in the home

1709
01:14:19,033 --> 01:14:21,033
that's making decisions for
your products and services

1710
01:14:21,033 --> 01:14:23,500
is starting to live there.

1711
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,934
So, here's what I would do.

1712
01:14:24,934 --> 01:14:26,433
I would go to Instagram.

1713
01:14:26,433 --> 01:14:27,800
Do you
personally have Instagram?

1714
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,367
- [Kara] I do
but I don't use it.

1715
01:14:29,367 --> 01:14:31,033
- Okay, open it,

1716
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:33,433
resign in if you
have to whatever.

1717
01:14:33,433 --> 01:14:35,233
There's a search function.

1718
01:14:35,233 --> 01:14:36,467
You know what a hashtag is

1719
01:14:36,467 --> 01:14:37,667
from Twitter?
- [Kara] Yes.

1720
01:14:37,667 --> 01:14:39,300
- Search hashtags,

1721
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,166
take the six most
important terms in your world,

1722
01:14:41,166 --> 01:14:42,133
pool, spa,

1723
01:14:42,133 --> 01:14:44,166
and then again I'm
not educated enough

1724
01:14:44,166 --> 01:14:45,867
I want you to get
into those second.

1725
01:14:45,867 --> 01:14:46,834
It's not wine,

1726
01:14:46,834 --> 01:14:48,266
it's Pinot Noir,

1727
01:14:48,266 --> 01:14:49,600
it's Bordeaux,

1728
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,600
it's Silicon Valley,
Sonoma Valley.

1729
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,133
You guys know those terms.

1730
01:14:53,133 --> 01:14:55,266
Search those terms on Instagram.

1731
01:14:55,266 --> 01:14:58,600
I want you to spend
between five and 10 hours,

1732
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,166
while you're on the flight,

1733
01:15:00,166 --> 01:15:02,000
walking down whatever.

1734
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,834
It doesn't have to
come in prime time.

1735
01:15:03,834 --> 01:15:05,867
Chip away in inefficient times.

1736
01:15:05,867 --> 01:15:08,433
And I want you to
search those hashtags

1737
01:15:08,433 --> 01:15:10,667
and look at all the
content that's being produced.

1738
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:12,066
Click into the content,

1739
01:15:12,066 --> 01:15:14,400
look at the engagement, 
look at the comments,

1740
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,700
and you get an audit and a feel.

1741
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:18,066
And you're like oh wow,

1742
01:15:18,066 --> 01:15:20,567
these kind of
photos are over indexing

1743
01:15:20,567 --> 01:15:23,467
across the entire
Instagram ecosystem.

1744
01:15:23,467 --> 01:15:26,000
It seems like when
people take photos of their pool

1745
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,600
at sunset people get like really

1746
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,100
like you'll pick up
on some action shots

1747
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:34,033
or one minute tutorials
of how to fix it instead of

1748
01:15:34,033 --> 01:15:36,734
back to that.
So, put in the work.

1749
01:15:36,734 --> 01:15:37,567
- [Kara] Yeah.

1750
01:15:37,567 --> 01:15:38,300
- Cool.
- [Kara] Thank you.

1751
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:41,567
- Yeah.
Questions?

1752
01:15:41,567 --> 01:15:42,467
My man's back over here.

1753
01:15:42,467 --> 01:15:43,300
Let's,

1754
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,567
we'll get to
second time over there.

1755
01:15:45,567 --> 01:15:46,400
Somebody over here?

1756
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,867
One more time
raise your hand for me?

1757
01:15:47,867 --> 01:15:48,767
Okay, just one.

1758
01:15:48,767 --> 01:15:50,433
Got it.
Great.

1759
01:15:50,433 --> 01:15:52,433
- [Josh] I'm Josh from
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

1760
01:15:52,433 --> 01:15:53,266
- Hey, Josh.

1761
01:15:53,266 --> 01:15:55,800
- How do you find
Instagram influencers

1762
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,533
for neighborhoods and markets?

1763
01:15:59,533 --> 01:16:01,967
- [Gary] You search again.

1764
01:16:01,967 --> 01:16:03,667
Hold the mic in
case there's a followup.

1765
01:16:03,667 --> 01:16:04,600
You search,

1766
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,033
you search by count.

1767
01:16:09,033 --> 01:16:10,367
So, you go into search

1768
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:13,066
and you can
search every single photo

1769
01:16:13,066 --> 01:16:15,233
that was posted in
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

1770
01:16:15,233 --> 01:16:18,633
And the first 12
photos are the top posts

1771
01:16:18,633 --> 01:16:21,133
and underneath that
are the most recent.

1772
01:16:21,133 --> 01:16:23,166
So, you search your zip code.

1773
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:25,934
You click the first photo.

1774
01:16:25,934 --> 01:16:28,667
The amount of hand-to-hand
combat this is

1775
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,433
that people don't want to do,

1776
01:16:30,433 --> 01:16:32,834
it's like sit ups.

1777
01:16:32,834 --> 01:16:34,834
We all known what sit ups do.

1778
01:16:34,834 --> 01:16:36,734
They do good things,

1779
01:16:36,734 --> 01:16:38,533
we just don't want to do them.

1780
01:16:38,533 --> 01:16:40,233
So, you have to do this work.

1781
01:16:40,233 --> 01:16:41,500
You have to go and search.

1782
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,300
You click.

1783
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,100
The first one's a
42 year old female

1784
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,667
that has 1400 followers.

1785
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:46,800
You look at her content.

1786
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,967
She seems to be
like a trendy mom.

1787
01:16:48,967 --> 01:16:51,667
You hit the upper right hand
corner and send her a message

1788
01:16:51,667 --> 01:16:54,200
and say to her we
think you're an influencer.

1789
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:57,467
We'd love to have
you post about our,

1790
01:16:57,467 --> 01:16:58,734
you go right there.

1791
01:16:58,734 --> 01:17:00,934
I'm comfortable going
in right for the hook.

1792
01:17:00,934 --> 01:17:02,600
You say look we
love your profile.

1793
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,467
We'd love for you to give
a shout out to our service.

1794
01:17:04,467 --> 01:17:06,600
But this is where
you deploy some empathy.

1795
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,166
Are you aware of our service?

1796
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:09,133
Do you care about that stuff?

1797
01:17:09,133 --> 01:17:09,967
If you are,

1798
01:17:09,967 --> 01:17:12,166
we'd love to do a
business transaction with you.

1799
01:17:12,166 --> 01:17:13,834
The reason I want you
to do business transaction,

1800
01:17:13,834 --> 01:17:15,166
these smaller influencers,

1801
01:17:15,166 --> 01:17:17,567
they're not
even expecting money.

1802
01:17:17,567 --> 01:17:18,667
If they happen to have a pool

1803
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:20,500
just you go and
checking out everything.

1804
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,333
Or like who knows?

1805
01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:24,133
Whatever like
light weight supplies?

1806
01:17:24,133 --> 01:17:25,433
And by the way,

1807
01:17:25,433 --> 01:17:27,467
sometimes just by bragging

1808
01:17:27,467 --> 01:17:28,734
that a business
reached out to them

1809
01:17:28,734 --> 01:17:30,266
and thought their
Instagram was cool enough

1810
01:17:30,266 --> 01:17:31,567
to give a shout out.

1811
01:17:31,567 --> 01:17:32,734
So you just do that at scale.

1812
01:17:32,734 --> 01:17:33,934
Other people will surprise you.

1813
01:17:33,934 --> 01:17:35,567
You'll listen to me.

1814
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:36,400
You'll do three of these.

1815
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,800
You'll be pumped you're
getting some shout outs.

1816
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:38,967
You do the fourth one

1817
01:17:38,967 --> 01:17:42,033
and she's like I
want $18,000 for a post.

1818
01:17:42,033 --> 01:17:42,867
You know?

1819
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:44,900
So, you've go
to learn that game.

1820
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:45,800
But that's how you do it,

1821
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,467
hand-to-hand combat.

1822
01:17:47,467 --> 01:17:49,700
- [Josh] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1823
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,200
- Yes, sir?

1824
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,734
- [Man] Question,
clearly content is king.

1825
01:17:54,734 --> 01:17:58,400
Many of us have,
"Click here to get our free

1826
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:00,600
"pool building guide.

1827
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,300
"Click here to get our
free spa buying guide."

1828
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,367
You're saying to cut
that up into little pieces

1829
01:18:05,367 --> 01:18:06,734
and turn 'em into videos?

1830
01:18:06,734 --> 01:18:08,433
- [Gary] I do, I do.

1831
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:10,533
I assume you're
using that as a gateway

1832
01:18:10,533 --> 01:18:12,266
to get the information to get--

1833
01:18:12,266 --> 01:18:14,433
- [Man] Capture, yeah,
putting in your email address

1834
01:18:14,433 --> 01:18:17,400
and then, bam, out it goes.
Then it's a trickle thing--

1835
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,033
- [Gary] Of course, 
it's a funnel.

1836
01:18:19,033 --> 01:18:22,734
- First five ideas on
things you need to know,

1837
01:18:22,734 --> 01:18:24,900
the next five things
that you need to know.

1838
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,667
So, you're saying to
turn everything into a video?

1839
01:18:27,667 --> 01:18:29,734
- [Gary] Yes, I'm saying that
one of those five ideas

1840
01:18:29,734 --> 01:18:32,800
in a minute, 37 second
video on Facebook,

1841
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,800
on Memorial Day
weekend gets shared enough

1842
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,100
to change your business way more

1843
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:38,633
than that funnel will ever do.

1844
01:18:38,633 --> 01:18:40,600
- [Man] Thank you.
- You got it.

1845
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,066
Hey, what's your name?

1846
01:18:43,066 --> 01:18:46,233
- Megan Spillers, I'm from
Champaign-Urbana in Illinois.

1847
01:18:46,233 --> 01:18:50,433
My question is
regarding Snapchat.

1848
01:18:50,433 --> 01:18:53,000
I'm just, kind of,
wondering your opinion

1849
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,433
on the format
since it's pictures,

1850
01:18:56,433 --> 01:18:58,300
10 second videos at max.

1851
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:02,333
I use it to send pictures
to my friends, cool places,

1852
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:05,867
all the places I went
last night in the city.

1853
01:19:05,867 --> 01:19:08,400
How can you
connect as a business?

1854
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,066
Are you just trying
to be forefront of mind?

1855
01:19:11,066 --> 01:19:14,834
Are you trying to get in touch
with influencers on Snapchat?

1856
01:19:14,834 --> 01:19:17,533
How can you utilize that?

1857
01:19:17,533 --> 01:19:19,934
- [Gary] As somebody who
invested five million dollars

1858
01:19:19,934 --> 01:19:21,867
into Snapchat several years ago,

1859
01:19:21,867 --> 01:19:23,934
I'm very
bullish on the platform.

1860
01:19:23,934 --> 01:19:24,900
I thought it was
was the first platform

1861
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,300
that came along that could

1862
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,333
really bring Facebook
a challenge

1863
01:19:28,333 --> 01:19:31,300
because it had won
the entire, at the time,

1864
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,200
13 to 22-year-old demo.

1865
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:37,233
It's an
incredibly powerful tool.

1866
01:19:37,233 --> 01:19:39,400
The reason I didn't
bring it up a lot here

1867
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,200
versus the last talk I gave,

1868
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,266
I spent 80% of my time on it

1869
01:19:43,266 --> 01:19:44,867
because the people in
the room were marketing

1870
01:19:44,867 --> 01:19:47,300
to 15 to 25-year-olds,

1871
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:50,867
is my concern is that
the demo is still too young.

1872
01:19:50,867 --> 01:19:53,667
In 2007, when I was
talking about Facebook

1873
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:55,166
I wasn't necessarily
talking to companies

1874
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:56,967
that were marketing to
70-year-olds.

1875
01:19:56,967 --> 01:19:58,900
Today, you heard
me talk about 50 to 70

1876
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,800
being my favorite demo.

1877
01:20:02,734 --> 01:20:04,400
I'm helping a a
startup that goes after people

1878
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,500
that are going
to retirement homes.

1879
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:09,333
Their number one
conversion is Facebook,

1880
01:20:09,333 --> 01:20:11,867
targeting 50 and 
60-year-olds of people

1881
01:20:11,867 --> 01:20:15,133
who have parents that are
70 and 80 and 90-year-olds.

1882
01:20:15,133 --> 01:20:17,066
So I think Snapchat's amazing.

1883
01:20:17,066 --> 01:20:18,367
I think it's got
a ton of work to do.

1884
01:20:18,367 --> 01:20:20,333
As you know
Instagram has copied almost

1885
01:20:20,333 --> 01:20:22,433
all their features over the
last three to four months,

1886
01:20:22,433 --> 01:20:25,900
which has slowed down some
of the growth for Snapchat.

1887
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:27,233
They've obviously got spectacles

1888
01:20:27,233 --> 01:20:29,233
and that's a whole
'nother thing of AR and VR

1889
01:20:29,233 --> 01:20:32,200
and live streaming.

1890
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,767
I don't think that
Snapchat, today at this moment,

1891
01:20:34,767 --> 01:20:37,333
is the craziest, most
important thing for this room.

1892
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:39,800
But, back to me
saying get on the treadmill

1893
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,533
before running the marathon,

1894
01:20:41,533 --> 01:20:43,400
do I believe
every single person here

1895
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,300
should download
Snapchat and figure it out?

1896
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:46,166
I do.

1897
01:20:46,166 --> 01:20:49,533
I know that seems
insane for so many of them.

1898
01:20:49,533 --> 01:20:51,266
How many people
here are now on Snapchat?

1899
01:20:51,266 --> 01:20:53,800
Raise your hand.

1900
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,133
A year ago this
would've been three hands.

1901
01:20:56,133 --> 01:20:58,800
It would've been three.

1902
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,567
What nobody realizes
is we're living in a world

1903
01:21:01,567 --> 01:21:04,533
where everybody's
living a younger life

1904
01:21:04,533 --> 01:21:06,066
than their parents did.

1905
01:21:06,066 --> 01:21:08,633
The younger
generation's dragging you down.

1906
01:21:08,633 --> 01:21:10,333
If you want to
talk to your daughter,

1907
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:11,166
you gotta get on Snapchat,

1908
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:12,600
that's where she's
spending 83% of her time

1909
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,066
so you're gonna be there.

1910
01:21:14,066 --> 01:21:15,066
It's an important platform.

1911
01:21:15,066 --> 01:21:17,700
Filters are super fascinating.

1912
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:20,367
The fact that people
here can buy a filter

1913
01:21:20,367 --> 01:21:22,834
for a hundred
bucks around the radius

1914
01:21:22,834 --> 01:21:25,867
of the most
important park in town,

1915
01:21:25,867 --> 01:21:27,233
that they may bring awareness,

1916
01:21:27,233 --> 01:21:28,633
I think is, kind of, cool.

1917
01:21:28,633 --> 01:21:31,567
I think in a year that would
be the strategy I'd probably do

1918
01:21:31,567 --> 01:21:32,934
which is buy a filter.

1919
01:21:32,934 --> 01:21:35,000
The way filters work is,
if you've been on Snapchat,

1920
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,633
I know a lot of you haven't
but it seems like a lot have,

1921
01:21:36,633 --> 01:21:37,567
you take a
picture and you can swipe

1922
01:21:37,567 --> 01:21:38,934
and get these little filters.

1923
01:21:38,934 --> 01:21:41,367
As a small business,
you can buy a filter.

1924
01:21:41,367 --> 01:21:42,400
I see University of Kentucky,

1925
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,633
you could buy a
filter over Rupp Arena,

1926
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:46,133
one day, for 500 bucks,

1927
01:21:46,133 --> 01:21:47,333
and then
everybody becomes aware.

1928
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:48,133
They're like, "What is this?"

1929
01:21:48,133 --> 01:21:48,967
And you have to be smart,

1930
01:21:48,967 --> 01:21:50,400
how do you make a
basketball and pool

1931
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,667
you gotta be creative.

1932
01:21:51,667 --> 01:21:54,834
But, that's branding,
that's less funnel,

1933
01:21:54,834 --> 01:21:57,533
and less conversion,
that's more branding.

1934
01:21:57,533 --> 01:22:00,033
Once something
has all the attention,

1935
01:22:00,033 --> 01:22:01,433
if I want to sell
something right now

1936
01:22:01,433 --> 01:22:03,300
to a 17-year-old in America,

1937
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:06,367
I'm only spending my
money on Instagram and Snapchat

1938
01:22:06,367 --> 01:22:08,567
not a penny anywhere else.

1939
01:22:08,567 --> 01:22:12,700
That 17-year-old
becomes 27 very quickly.

1940
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:14,367
You got it.

1941
01:22:14,367 --> 01:22:16,433
Back there, yup, got 'em.

1942
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:21,033
This is fun.

1943
01:22:21,033 --> 01:22:22,734
- [Nick] Absolute pleasure,
thank you very much.

1944
01:22:22,734 --> 01:22:25,533
My name's Nick, I'm
from Toronto, Ontario.

1945
01:22:25,533 --> 01:22:27,667
I'd like to get your
input on augmented reality

1946
01:22:27,667 --> 01:22:29,066
and where it's going.

1947
01:22:29,066 --> 01:22:31,333
- [Gary] It's gonna happen.

1948
01:22:31,333 --> 01:22:34,800
How many people played
Pokemon GO, raise your hands?

1949
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,500
Raise it high.

1950
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:37,333
It's a good number.

1951
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:41,834
So, prior to Pokemon Go, zero
hands, augmented reality,

1952
01:22:41,834 --> 01:22:44,500
we will be seeing things.

1953
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:47,200
You wanna really get
into black and white?

1954
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,266
The reason I
won't give this advice

1955
01:22:49,266 --> 01:22:52,333
is because this would
cost $150,000 to build

1956
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:54,934
and I don't think that's
practical for the high-risk,

1957
01:22:54,934 --> 01:22:57,400
low-reward chance
of pulling this off,

1958
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,800
but this is a perfect
example of how Angie's List

1959
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,767
or, remember when I said put
yourself out of business?

1960
01:23:03,767 --> 01:23:05,800
If somebody here's
big enough to do this,

1961
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,400
you should debate this.

1962
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:11,033
What if you built the app
that looked at your backyard

1963
01:23:11,033 --> 01:23:14,300
like this, and helped
them put the size of the pool

1964
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:16,433
that they should put in, 
and then that app,

1965
01:23:16,433 --> 01:23:20,567
because it's a utility,
was a gateway for your service?

1966
01:23:22,433 --> 01:23:24,500
So what I just
said is gonna happen.

1967
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,266
People are gonna go
into their backyard,

1968
01:23:26,266 --> 01:23:27,934
they're gonna pull out their
phone, they're gonna point it,

1969
01:23:27,934 --> 01:23:28,900
they're gonna see their backyard

1970
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,700
as if they were taking a photo,
but they're gonna do that

1971
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:33,867
through the app
called Pool Locator.

1972
01:23:33,867 --> 01:23:35,900
And it's going to do
whatever the hell you guys do

1973
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:40,600
for a living and figure out
that he needs to cut that tree

1974
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,300
and the app would
eliminate that tree

1975
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:45,567
and would show him
the options of the pool,

1976
01:23:45,567 --> 01:23:47,033
and then he would
say, "I like that,"

1977
01:23:47,033 --> 01:23:49,500
he would press a button,
she would press a button,

1978
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,767
and you would be
the person that does it.

1979
01:23:51,767 --> 01:23:54,834
And as you think,
if you make the utility

1980
01:23:54,834 --> 01:23:56,500
and get tens and
thousands and hundreds,

1981
01:23:56,500 --> 01:24:01,333
and then you could not only
service Grand Rapids, Michigan,

1982
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:03,800
but then you could
refer all the leads,

1983
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,667
'cause the app was big,
to all the other people

1984
01:24:05,667 --> 01:24:09,100
in this room and
make 20% referral fee

1985
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:12,633
through having the biggest
app of how people now decide

1986
01:24:12,633 --> 01:24:15,033
where they're gonna put a pool.

1987
01:24:15,033 --> 01:24:16,934
That's what I
think's gonna happen.

1988
01:24:16,934 --> 01:24:18,133
That was cool, actually.

1989
01:24:18,133 --> 01:24:19,100
That was a good idea.

1990
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:20,100
Somebody should do that.

1991
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:23,600
(audience laughter)

1992
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,033
Yep, over there, yep.

1993
01:24:25,033 --> 01:24:28,400
Oh, oh, great, yeah,
let's get on this side.

1994
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,567
- [Kathy] Hi, Kathy
from Aqua-Tech

1995
01:24:29,567 --> 01:24:31,934
in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

1996
01:24:31,934 --> 01:24:35,133
Just wanted to find out if
you could help me prioritize

1997
01:24:35,133 --> 01:24:37,066
in the exact
order that you think

1998
01:24:37,066 --> 01:24:39,600
I should be spending my time.

1999
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,467
Right now we do a lot of
email marketing, primarily,

2000
01:24:42,467 --> 01:24:46,166
so my marching orders, when
I go home, should be what?

2001
01:24:46,166 --> 01:24:47,800
- [Gary] How's email doing?

2002
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:48,633
- Fabulous.

2003
01:24:48,633 --> 01:24:50,333
- And so explain that in detail.

2004
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:52,367
You're collecting emails somehow

2005
01:24:52,367 --> 01:24:53,700
and then you're
marketing against it?

2006
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:54,533
- [Kathy] Correct.

2007
01:24:54,533 --> 01:24:56,066
- Yeah.

2008
01:24:56,066 --> 01:24:57,834
The thing that will
probably excite you the most

2009
01:24:57,834 --> 01:24:59,633
in the quickest period of time,

2010
01:24:59,633 --> 01:25:01,600
because the vulnerability is
the first six months or year

2011
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,700
when it's not working as
well 'cause you don't have

2012
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:06,100
all the expertise, is Facebook.

2013
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:07,900
Facebook is the
closest thing to email

2014
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:09,800
in the marketing
realm right now.

2015
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,934
So how are you collecting email?

2016
01:25:11,934 --> 01:25:13,734
- [Kathy] With every water test
and every transaction.

2017
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:14,600
- [Gary] Got it.

2018
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,367
And then you're
remarketing for services?

2019
01:25:16,367 --> 01:25:17,233
- [Kathy] Correct.

2020
01:25:17,233 --> 01:25:20,467
- So it's more of a farming
mechanism than a hunting?

2021
01:25:20,467 --> 01:25:22,200
- [Kathy] Correct.
- Got it.

2022
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:27,233
So, I think email and text
messaging, and following them

2023
01:25:27,233 --> 01:25:28,834
on Facebook and
surprising them--

2024
01:25:28,834 --> 01:25:30,266
- [Kathy] That's a kick butt
idea.

2025
01:25:30,266 --> 01:25:31,467
- And I knew you would like that

2026
01:25:31,467 --> 01:25:34,834
because you like email because
it's a retention vehicle.

2027
01:25:34,834 --> 01:25:37,767
So let's talk about the
hunting, instead of the farming.

2028
01:25:37,767 --> 01:25:40,066
How are you getting clients?

2029
01:25:40,066 --> 01:25:41,900
- Our website, primarily.

2030
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:44,633
We've spent a lot of time and
effort into Google ratings,

2031
01:25:44,633 --> 01:25:47,233
so I think that we should
stop half, and maybe--

2032
01:25:47,233 --> 01:25:48,066
- [Gary] I don't
think you should,

2033
01:25:48,066 --> 01:25:49,834
by the way, it's never like,

2034
01:25:49,834 --> 01:25:51,467
people still look at billboards.

2035
01:25:51,467 --> 01:25:53,300
Do I think they're as
valuable as they used to be?

2036
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:55,367
They can't be, because
every passenger's looking

2037
01:25:55,367 --> 01:25:57,567
at their phone, and
those are lost eyeballs.

2038
01:25:57,567 --> 01:25:58,667
(audience laughter)

2039
01:25:58,667 --> 01:26:01,133
So, it's not that
you should stop that,

2040
01:26:01,133 --> 01:26:04,700
but back to having so
much time, money, and energy.

2041
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:06,066
Facebook.

2042
01:26:06,066 --> 01:26:07,467
You have to
understand what Facebook is.

2043
01:26:07,467 --> 01:26:11,734
Facebook is direct response
sales and branding.

2044
01:26:11,734 --> 01:26:13,100
You can do both.

2045
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:14,500
Whereas Google
and Google reviews

2046
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:15,567
it's all black and white,

2047
01:26:15,567 --> 01:26:17,333
it's all blue,
actually, blue, right?

2048
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:18,667
It's not building brand.

2049
01:26:18,667 --> 01:26:21,266
These videos that I'm
desperate, and by the way,

2050
01:26:21,266 --> 01:26:22,700
are you guys
completely blown away as I am,

2051
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:25,166
the quality of
video from just this?

2052
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:27,500
You don't need to
hire DRock. Sorry, DRock.

2053
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,367
(audience laughter)

2054
01:26:29,367 --> 01:26:30,700
This!

2055
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:31,734
This!

2056
01:26:31,734 --> 01:26:35,734
And the other thing is, every
single 17-year-old in America

2057
01:26:35,734 --> 01:26:37,300
knows what to do.

2058
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:40,033
So you've unlimited
kids in Winnipeg or Toronto

2059
01:26:40,033 --> 01:26:42,633
that are willing to do
it for minimal or free.

2060
01:26:42,633 --> 01:26:45,467
More video content on
Facebook as a gateway drug.

2061
01:26:45,467 --> 01:26:49,533
There's a phone call ad on
Facebook which I brought up

2062
01:26:49,533 --> 01:26:52,333
to you, I really
want you to do that.

2063
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:54,700
It's an ad that is underused
because small businesses

2064
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:57,767
are underusing Facebook,
and big companies,

2065
01:26:57,767 --> 01:27:00,900
Coke and Pepsi and BMW
don't want you to call them.

2066
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:04,533
So it's an ad that has creative
but it also has a button

2067
01:27:04,533 --> 01:27:06,133
for the phone, and
as you guys all know,

2068
01:27:06,133 --> 01:27:08,333
now we look at Facebook on this,

2069
01:27:08,333 --> 01:27:10,166
not on your desktop as
much, so when you see it,

2070
01:27:10,166 --> 01:27:12,967
you press one
button and you're calling.

2071
01:27:12,967 --> 01:27:15,934
So, Facebook,
Facebook, Facebook.

2072
01:27:15,934 --> 01:27:20,066
Targeted, geo-located to the
Winnipeg area,

2073
01:27:20,066 --> 01:27:21,467
that would be the place.

2074
01:27:21,467 --> 01:27:23,000
And again, because
we have limited time,

2075
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,533
there's a website, all of
you should write this down.

2076
01:27:25,533 --> 01:27:28,133
This is probably the information
gateway you're looking for.

2077
01:27:28,133 --> 01:27:30,266
There's a website,
I'll spell it for you,

2078
01:27:30,266 --> 01:27:33,133
and that's where you can get
deeper information about this.

2079
01:27:33,133 --> 01:27:34,800
It's spelled G,

2080
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:35,834
O,

2081
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:37,000
O,

2082
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,433
G,
(audience laughs)

2083
01:27:38,433 --> 01:27:39,633
L,

2084
01:27:39,633 --> 01:27:41,367
E.

2085
01:27:41,367 --> 01:27:43,166
And here's why
I'm making that joke.

2086
01:27:43,166 --> 01:27:46,133
If you wanna say, "How
do I make Facebook video

2087
01:27:46,133 --> 01:27:48,367
"for a small business,"
you type that into Google

2088
01:27:48,367 --> 01:27:51,133
and you'll have plenty of
articles and plenty of videos.

2089
01:27:51,133 --> 01:27:54,033
This is like exercise.

2090
01:27:54,033 --> 01:27:58,166
You know what to do, you
just don't want to do it.

2091
01:28:00,033 --> 01:28:03,200
So, now I can give
you one good answer,

2092
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,734
now that I've understood
where you're coming from

2093
01:28:04,734 --> 01:28:07,033
and what you react to:
get great at Facebook.

2094
01:28:07,033 --> 01:28:08,834
We're gonna have two to three
years, everybody in this room

2095
01:28:08,834 --> 01:28:11,433
that doesn't listen to me, in
three years, will regret it

2096
01:28:11,433 --> 01:28:15,133
when all the articles of
2020 is, now it costs $80

2097
01:28:15,133 --> 01:28:18,900
to get in front of 1,000 people
on Facebook instead of $6.

2098
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:22,700
We all "missed" it
from 2015 to 2020, got it?

2099
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:23,367
- [Kathy] Got it.

2100
01:28:23,367 --> 01:28:24,800
- Because you know how
much the word wine cost

2101
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,000
per click, in 2002?

2102
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,066
Five cents.

2103
01:28:28,066 --> 01:28:29,166
Now it's $13.

2104
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:34,100
Installing a
pool cost five cents.

2105
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,900
Now it's
probably something else.

2106
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:37,367
And so that's what's
gonna happen on Facebook,

2107
01:28:37,367 --> 01:28:38,533
that's why I'm pushing you all.

2108
01:28:38,533 --> 01:28:40,300
It's a supply and demand.

2109
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:44,033
Everybody wants to get to a
40-year-old female in Winnipeg,

2110
01:28:44,033 --> 01:28:45,734
a 40-year-old female in
Calgary,

2111
01:28:45,734 --> 01:28:47,066
a 40-year-old woman in New York.

2112
01:28:47,066 --> 01:28:49,767
They're the decision maker
of so many transactions.

2113
01:28:49,767 --> 01:28:51,633
You're not competing
with everybody in this room,

2114
01:28:51,633 --> 01:28:53,800
you're competing with
every business in the world

2115
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:57,133
'cause Facebook has to
keep the ads under control,

2116
01:28:57,133 --> 01:28:59,400
'cause if you get too
many ads, you're gonna leave,

2117
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,633
so only so many
ads can get in there,

2118
01:29:01,633 --> 01:29:04,533
which means the price of the
ad will continue to go up

2119
01:29:04,533 --> 01:29:07,166
once people realize
how well it's working.

2120
01:29:07,166 --> 01:29:08,667
Supply and demand.

2121
01:29:11,867 --> 01:29:12,700
You're welcome.
- [Kathy] Thank you.

2122
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:14,100
Let's get another
one over there.

2123
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:15,767
Yeah.

2124
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:24,867
- Hi, I'm Mary from Maryland,
from Regina Pools and Spas.

2125
01:29:24,867 --> 01:29:25,700
- [Gary] How are you?

2126
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:26,500
- Good, how are you.

2127
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:27,333
- [Gary] Amazing.

2128
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:30,967
- Good, my question to
you is we've actually started

2129
01:29:30,967 --> 01:29:32,934
shooting Facebook Live videos,

2130
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:35,333
because it sends a notification
out to our followers

2131
01:29:35,333 --> 01:29:38,533
that we're live, so
that they can come to us.

2132
01:29:38,533 --> 01:29:41,100
And shooting little
tidbit videos on how to maintain

2133
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:44,333
a hot tub right now, because
pool season is closed for us.

2134
01:29:44,333 --> 01:29:45,934
- [Gary] Yup.

2135
01:29:45,934 --> 01:29:47,033
- Do you think that...

2136
01:29:47,033 --> 01:29:49,033
There's also Instagram Live,

2137
01:29:49,033 --> 01:29:51,734
but you can't do that at the
same time as Facebook Live.

2138
01:29:51,734 --> 01:29:52,834
- [Gary] You sure can.

2139
01:29:52,834 --> 01:29:53,667
- You can do it?

2140
01:29:53,667 --> 01:29:55,100
- [Gary] Yeah, you just
have to get a second phone.

2141
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:56,934
- Yeah, well yes, there's that.

2142
01:29:56,934 --> 01:29:58,433
(audience laughter)

2143
01:29:58,433 --> 01:30:00,200
- [Gary] Guys, I'm a genius!

2144
01:30:03,066 --> 01:30:05,800
- But my question to you is--

2145
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:06,700
- [Gary] So definitely do that!

2146
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:11,300
- Yes, so we'll get
a second video going.

2147
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:13,000
If we're not
doing Facebook Live,

2148
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,100
and you're telling
people to shoot content,

2149
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:16,166
what kind of camera?

2150
01:30:16,166 --> 01:30:17,600
Should we just use iPhones,

2151
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,900
or should we actually go
get a camera and some mics?

2152
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:23,367
- I think that the
iPhone is more than capable

2153
01:30:23,367 --> 01:30:26,367
to produce the quality video
that everybody in this room,

2154
01:30:26,367 --> 01:30:27,800
based on the size of
business that I believe is

2155
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:30,333
in this room, needs, yeah.

2156
01:30:30,333 --> 01:30:30,900
- [Mary] Thank you.

2157
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:32,633
- How is the
Facebook Live going for you?

2158
01:30:32,633 --> 01:30:35,567
- So we recently just
started it last month.

2159
01:30:35,567 --> 01:30:37,433
- [Gary] How many Facebook
fans do you have on your page?

2160
01:30:37,433 --> 01:30:39,033
- Not much.
- [Gary] How many?

2161
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:40,500
- 465, I believe.

2162
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,533
- [Gary] So I assume that means
you're getting one to two

2163
01:30:42,533 --> 01:30:43,400
people watching the streams.

2164
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,133
- Yes, at the current
moment but some--

2165
01:30:45,133 --> 01:30:46,767
- [Gary] You know what,
I love you for that.

2166
01:30:46,767 --> 01:30:49,000
I don't know, one to
two is better than zero.

2167
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,800
- Right, and we
get a couple likes.

2168
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,367
The first couple videos,
we've only done three.

2169
01:30:53,367 --> 01:30:55,834
The first two
got around 200 views,

2170
01:30:55,834 --> 01:30:58,934
and then our third one
actually got over 300 views,

2171
01:30:58,934 --> 01:31:00,567
so it's slowly--

2172
01:31:00,567 --> 01:31:04,133
- When you finally post it,
make sure you're adding

2173
01:31:04,133 --> 01:31:06,900
a link to drive to a conversion.

2174
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:08,600
- [Mary] Right, so that's
something that

2175
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,700
we haven't been doing,
but as you were speaking today,

2176
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:13,400
that is something in my
notes to do for the next one.

2177
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:14,700
- Because what I like
is when people are trying

2178
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:17,300
to be pioneers
and do new things...

2179
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:21,333
Like, you know
what old man Stan, 67,

2180
01:31:21,333 --> 01:31:25,300
sitting over there and thought
about 300 views, jack crap.

2181
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:27,734
He wants to know what
it meant for the business.

2182
01:31:27,734 --> 01:31:30,333
And so for me, what I like is
I don't care how many likes,

2183
01:31:30,333 --> 01:31:32,867
I don't care how many
followers, I don't care.

2184
01:31:32,867 --> 01:31:35,200
I mean, I care because it's
a proxy normally if you're

2185
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,233
good at it to where it's going.

2186
01:31:37,233 --> 01:31:39,500
I wanna figure out
where does it lead to.

2187
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:40,767
And the good part is
you're just starting.

2188
01:31:40,767 --> 01:31:42,500
Like to me, back to
patience, reason I said

2189
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:44,300
the first six months
scare me with you,

2190
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:46,667
like the biggest fear
I have here is this was a good

2191
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:49,333
session, it was this,
and then you know,

2192
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:50,633
you're gonna go out of
business if you don't listen,

2193
01:31:50,633 --> 01:31:52,433
then it's been
detailed, and da da.

2194
01:31:52,433 --> 01:31:55,233
It's all this, and there's
like nine to 15, to 22 people

2195
01:31:55,233 --> 01:31:56,633
that are sitting here
saying, you know what?

2196
01:31:56,633 --> 01:31:57,533
Yes, this is gonna...

2197
01:31:57,533 --> 01:32:00,100
Oh, and it's January 4,
exactly, so we're like yeah,

2198
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,200
this is the year!

2199
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,333
You know, it's all that stuff,

2200
01:32:03,333 --> 01:32:06,266
but it's hard and it takes time.

2201
01:32:06,266 --> 01:32:09,033
Right, now what I'm excited
about, back to pool season,

2202
01:32:09,033 --> 01:32:11,700
I don't know when people
decide that, or service it,

2203
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:15,834
or buy that, or what have
you but if you can do this

2204
01:32:15,834 --> 01:32:18,033
hard and well, and
learn for the next three,

2205
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:21,500
four, five, six months,
really nice early things

2206
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,633
can start happening
the back end of this year.

2207
01:32:23,633 --> 01:32:26,233
And then '18 can be
really interesting.

2208
01:32:26,233 --> 01:32:28,200
I just wanna make
sure everybody understands

2209
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:30,600
the advice I'm giving here,
if you decide to go look

2210
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:34,767
deeper and you look at it,
it's not easy, it's called work.

2211
01:32:36,266 --> 01:32:38,700
This isn't a I'm gonna 
miraculously hire

2212
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:40,934
this 22-year-old.

2213
01:32:40,934 --> 01:32:44,266
22-year-olds use Snapchat 
and Instagram to hook up.

2214
01:32:44,266 --> 01:32:47,533
(audience laughter)
Not sell pools.

2215
01:32:47,533 --> 01:32:50,667
It's a different skill set,
but they do understand it.

2216
01:32:50,667 --> 01:32:51,834
Cool, thanks.

2217
01:32:51,834 --> 01:32:53,700
- [Mary] Thank you.

2218
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:54,533
- Any other questions?

2219
01:32:54,533 --> 01:32:56,066
Yeah, that's good, this
will be the last question.

2220
01:32:56,066 --> 01:32:59,567
Thank you guys so
much for your attention.

2221
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:09,533
- [Ava] Hey, I'm Ava from
West Bernard, Louisiana,

2222
01:33:09,533 --> 01:33:13,567
and we live in a
very small area about,

2223
01:33:13,567 --> 01:33:17,000
all of our little small areas,
maybe 60,000 people.

2224
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,567
- [Gary] Okay.

2225
01:33:18,567 --> 01:33:24,266
So, our Facebook following,
currently, is 231, to be exact.

2226
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:29,600
How do you know if
you're actually reaching enough

2227
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,367
for your area?

2228
01:33:31,367 --> 01:33:33,367
We only have one
other competitor,

2229
01:33:33,367 --> 01:33:35,767
they have about 400 followers.

2230
01:33:35,767 --> 01:33:38,667
How can we maximize
getting our customers

2231
01:33:38,667 --> 01:33:40,100
to our Facebook page?

2232
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:41,800
- [Gary] So, I think

2233
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:46,100
and is your ambition to
continue to service that 60,000?

2234
01:33:47,066 --> 01:33:47,934
- [Ava] Huh?

2235
01:33:47,934 --> 01:33:50,300
- Are you guys
gonna expand the business,

2236
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:51,400
do you want more locations?

2237
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:52,667
Do you want to go
into other cities?

2238
01:33:52,667 --> 01:33:54,633
Or this is a family business,
this is what you're doing?

2239
01:33:54,633 --> 01:33:55,900
- Family business,
this is what we're doing.

2240
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:59,900
- Great, I would go knock
on all 60,000 homes, door.

2241
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:02,633
- [Ava] Realistic.
- I'm being dead, seriously.

2242
01:34:02,633 --> 01:34:06,567
I swear on my children's
health that I would spend

2243
01:34:06,567 --> 01:34:08,934
the rest of my life
trying to build a relationship

2244
01:34:08,934 --> 01:34:11,433
with all 60,000
people individually,

2245
01:34:11,433 --> 01:34:12,300
because I think it can be done,

2246
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:14,400
it's not that big of a number.

2247
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,533
I'm being dead serious.

2248
01:34:16,533 --> 01:34:20,233
So the way I would do
that to scale is if I ran your

2249
01:34:20,233 --> 01:34:24,333
business, I would
probably try to invent a

2250
01:34:24,333 --> 01:34:29,033
town wide event
that everybody went to,

2251
01:34:29,033 --> 01:34:31,066
that I was the
owner of that event,

2252
01:34:31,066 --> 01:34:33,300
and used the event as
the gateway to be the biggest

2253
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:35,934
business in town.

2254
01:34:35,934 --> 01:34:39,567
I would create the
annual 100 meter dash,

2255
01:34:39,567 --> 01:34:41,367
or pickle eating contest.

2256
01:34:41,367 --> 01:34:43,900
I'm being dead
serious with you by the way.

2257
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:46,533
And then the content
would be about the event

2258
01:34:46,533 --> 01:34:48,867
because when you have
such a small circumference,

2259
01:34:48,867 --> 01:34:50,667
you can really do
the thank you economy

2260
01:34:50,667 --> 01:34:54,200
in hand-to-hand combat, and so
I'd probably run Facebook,

2261
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:55,967
I wouldn't care
about likes at all.

2262
01:34:55,967 --> 01:34:58,333
231 versus 400 means nothing.

2263
01:34:58,333 --> 01:34:59,800
I would probably run some

2264
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:03,300
Facebook ads
against the zip code,

2265
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:05,367
and I would try to
literally meet them.

2266
01:35:05,367 --> 01:35:09,867
I'm not kidding, I would think
a lot about event marketing.

2267
01:35:09,867 --> 01:35:10,967
I mean, I assume
you're not spending

2268
01:35:10,967 --> 01:35:12,533
a lot of money on marketing.

2269
01:35:12,533 --> 01:35:14,800
- Actually, none.

2270
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:17,033
- [Gary] Right, 
that makes sense.

2271
01:35:17,033 --> 01:35:19,233
- We have good word of mouth.

2272
01:35:19,233 --> 01:35:21,133
- [Gary] Of course,
so you're basically sitting

2273
01:35:21,133 --> 01:35:23,233
and waiting for
people to call you?

2274
01:35:23,233 --> 01:35:23,967
- [Ava] Absolutely.

2275
01:35:23,967 --> 01:35:26,133
- I hate the
living shit out of that.

2276
01:35:26,133 --> 01:35:29,567
(audience laughter)

2277
01:35:29,567 --> 01:35:34,100
- But we do, we offer
so much for our community,

2278
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:37,166
and we're so well known that...

2279
01:35:37,166 --> 01:35:38,700
My father-in-law
owns the business,

2280
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:41,934
and his mentality is I
don't need to spend money

2281
01:35:41,934 --> 01:35:44,166
on marketing when we
have as much business

2282
01:35:44,166 --> 01:35:46,066
as we can handle
at this current time.

2283
01:35:46,066 --> 01:35:48,133
So we're kind of--

2284
01:35:48,133 --> 01:35:53,367
- [Gary] Listen, I can't
deploy my thesis or ambition

2285
01:35:53,367 --> 01:35:54,900
on your father-in-law.

2286
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:56,967
Like, when I hear that
we have more business than

2287
01:35:56,967 --> 01:36:00,066
we can handle, my mind
goes to you better hire

2288
01:36:00,066 --> 01:36:01,734
a bunch more people, jerk.

2289
01:36:01,734 --> 01:36:04,867
(audeince laughter)

2290
01:36:04,867 --> 01:36:07,600
- Yeah.
- [Gary] Yeah.

2291
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:08,767
Family dynamics.

2292
01:36:08,767 --> 01:36:10,333
(audience laughter)

2293
01:36:10,333 --> 01:36:13,000
Thank you guys, thank you!

2294
01:36:13,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(audience applause)
