Usually I'm in your world.

- I'm excited about this.
- Yeah man.

rubbin' you the wrong way,

19
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,083

00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,041
Now author of Black Privilege:
Opportunity Comes

21
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,417

radio personality,

22
00:01:03,417 --> 00:01:05,500
TV personality,
professional slang-spitter,

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,250
heavy-hitter, shit-talker.

24
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,291
- Wow.
- My man,GaryVee.

25
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,708
- You know, you really
got your thing down.

26
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:13,583
That was really strong.
(Cha laughs)

27
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:16,333
So listen, one
that that excites me is,

28
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,959
you're interesting to me.

29
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:21,667
You're interesting to
me because I think you

30
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,750
really, really, really get it.
- Mhmmm.

31
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,667
- The reason I've really
enjoyed gettin' to know you

32
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:27,667
and your crew is like
I just think you get it.

33
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:29,500
And what I mean
by getting it, is

34
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,625
I think you're intent is good.

35
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,333
I love that.
- Everything is about intent.

36
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:36,041
- And then I think you
understand where attention is.

37
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,708
And I like the way that
you put yourself in positions

38
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:42,458
to be heard, to hack culture.
- Mhmmm.

39
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,583
- I just think it's smart.
And I think you're a nice guy.

40
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:46,875
- Yeah, thank you.
I appreciate that.

41
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,375
My grandmother would
always told me manners

42
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,166
will take you where money won't.

43
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,417
So, I mean, I don't
have like a formal education.

44
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:54,166
I didn't go to
college or anything like that.

45
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,208
So all I have is like--
- [Gary] What you got.

46
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,000
- That's what I got.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,583
When I walk in a room,
I just try to, you know,

48
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,291
show love to everybody,
treat everybody the way

49
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,542
I would want to be treated.

50
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:03,000
Treat 'em with respect.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,166
And you know, it seems
good things come from it.

52
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,708
- Now you're

53
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,542

66
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,583
- How'd you get
all these fancy people

67
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:33,625
to give you quotes?

68
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,959
- That's just years and
years of networking, man.

69
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:37,583
I mean, I got
Lena Dunham on the back.

70
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,166
Lena Dunham is
somebody I met maybe

71
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,250
like a couple years ago.

72
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,125
I call her my
problematic princess.

73
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,583
You know, cause I've
always been a fan of "Girls".

74
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,417
And she started responding
to me on social media.

75
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,875
You know, social media
connects the world.

76
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,417
If it was six
degrees of separation before,

77
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:52,417
now it's like one or two.
- [Gary] It's true.

78
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:54,250
- Issa Rae, you know,
somebody who I--

79
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,792
- A lot goes down on DM.
- Yeah, yeah.

80
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:58,959
Issa Rae, I don't
know if you know Issa Rae.

81
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,166
Issa Rae has a show
on HBO called "Insecure".

82
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,208
And she's one of those
people that had just utilized

83
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,917
the digital
world to her advantage,

84
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:07,708
'cause she started off
with a web show called

85
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:08,959
"Awkward Black Girl".

86
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,083
Turned into a book,
now it's a hit

87
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,875
television show
called "Insecure".

88
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,250
Stephen Colbert,
South Carolina legend.

89
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,291
I've done the Colbert show.

90
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,417
- How'd you feel about South
Carolina losin' final four?

91
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:18,250
Were you sad?

92
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,083
- It hurt, I went
to the game though.

93
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:19,917
- [Gary] You were
really into it, right?

94
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:21,875
- Yeah, my wife went to the
University of South Carolina.

95
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,000
I had a lot of
sex in the quad house.

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,625
You know, a lot of
unprotected sex back in the day

97
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,583
on the University of
South Carolina campus.

98
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,542
- Don't promote,
you're gonna get in trouble.

99
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,000
Don't promote unprotected sex.

100
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,125
- Oh, I'm married now.

101
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,417
- No, Trojan the
brand could be watching.

102
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:37,333
I'm not talking
about people, brands.

103
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,875
- I did used to wear
magnums when I was,

104
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,750
you know, having
sex with other women.

105
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,041
- I see this book everywhere,

106
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,083
like you're really doing it.

107
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,792
- I'm tryin', man, I'm tryin'
to follow your lead.

108
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:48,000
- Well you did, you
followed that little

109
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,083
hack direct to Amazon.
- Absolutely.

110
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,917
- So, what is
exciting you right now?

111
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:53,917
You've obviously got this.

112
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:55,917
What is the
premise of Black Privilege?

113
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:59,083
- The premise of Black
Privilege: Opportunity Comes

114
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,458
to Those Who
Create It, it's this

115
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,959
whole concept in
America of white privilege,

116
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,959
which is a very real concept,
you know, but I feel like--

117
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,333
- Wealth privilege.
- Wealth privilege.

118
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,000
- No matter what
you look like. That's real.

119
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,917
- Wealth privilege is
real, celebrity privilege is.

120
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,875
There's all type of
different privileges.

121
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,250
- Celebrity privilege may
be the realest of them all.

122
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,083
- It might be
realest of them all.

123
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:15,959
- It might be
realest of them all.

124
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,500
- That's why
Donald Trump is president.

125
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,625
- It might be the
realest of them all, right?

126
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,750
- I absolutely agree with that.

127
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,959
So I just feel like you have
to embrace what you have.

128
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,375
Like, I was created a black man.

129
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,708
Like how you always talk
about when a person had sex.

130
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,333
One sperm cell out of millions.

131
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,583
- It's just crazy.

132
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,250
- One sperm cell--
- You got lucky.

133
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,667
- Out of millions
created us, so it's a privilege

134
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:36,125
just to be alive
and be breathin'.

135
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,166
So for me, I am what I am.

136
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,542
I'm a black man in
America, so I have to

137
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:41,291
find privilege within that.

138
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,208
Like I can't
look at a white person

139
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,750
and be like, he's got
more privilege than me

140
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,500
because of the color
of his skin even though

141
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,375
that may be true.
I still gotta live.

142
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,333
- It's a mindset.
- It's a mindset.

143
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,917
- Like it's like sports, right?

144
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,542
Like, okay, he's
faster so, you know,

145
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:56,417
drill into him
cause he's not as strong.

146
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:58,333
Do something.
- So I shouldn't run?

147
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,083
I shouldn't even compete,
just 'cause he's faster than me?

148
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:04,125
- Or I actually, genuinely
think like, look he's faster.

149
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,542
So like, I'm stronger.

150
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:07,542
I'm gonna bash him
down for three quarters

151
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:09,417
and by the end, I'll win.
- Absolutely.

152
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:11,375
- Like, and by the
way, to black privilege,

153
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,667
which I genuinely believe that
in a world that we live in,

154
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:16,500
and by the way, I believe
in all those privileges,

155
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,959
wealth, white, celebrity.

156
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,792
It's a better time to be
black than it was 30, 40,

157
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,583
50, 60, 70, 80 years ago.

158
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,542
Especially,
when hip hop culture,

159
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:27,125
there's not a white kid that
works that works VaynerMedia

160
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,542
that's isn't
affected by hip hop culture.

161
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:30,125
- Oh yeah, I mean black
people have changed the world.

162
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,333
It's so funny,
they talk about people

163
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,250
co-opting our
culture, but you look

164
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,500
at a movie like "Get Out".

165
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,625
They want to co-opt
our consciousness, period.

166
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,125
They want to co-opt our spirit.

167
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,291
And I just feel
like it's a spirit

168
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,959
that is permeating
the whole planet.

169
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,750
Like everything starts and end,
to me, with hip hop culture.

170
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,750
Like they still like to
use the term pop culture,

171
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,166
but pop culture
just means popular.

172
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,667
What's the most
popular culture out right now?

173
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:53,583
Hip hop.

174
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,333
- Let's go to the phones, Andy.

175
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,875
And so, let's talk about hip hop

176
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,125
while Andy gets the first call.

177
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,041
Who's exciting you right now?

178
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,750
- Right now
I still love Big Sean.

179
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,959
I think Big Sean is the
best rapper out right now.

180
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,792
Kendrick--

181
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,041
- Why do you think
he's the best rapper?

182
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,750
- 'Cause I'm just
simple with it.

183
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,625
Lyrics, delivery, bars,
you know, different flows.

184
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,000
I think Big Sean got that.

185
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,750
For whatever reason, people
don't take him serious enough.

186
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,000
- Why?
- I don't know.

187
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,041
It's interesting with him,
like somebody like Kendrick

188
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,291
can say something and everybody
holds on to his every word.

189
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,041
- 'Cause Kendrick plays
that role where he's like,

190
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,708
he positioned himself
like thoughtful like that.

191
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:27,750
- [Hashim] Hello?
- True.

192
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,667
- Hello, what's your name?

193
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,625
- [Hashim] Hashim.
Hashim Lafond.

194
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,959
- My man, you're on
The #AskGaryVee Show with Cha.

195
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,917
- [Hashim] Yes!
(group laughter)

196
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:40,125
- What's up, my guy?
- [Hashim] C Tha God, what's up?

197
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,667
- What's up, brother?
How are you?

198
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:43,792
- [Hashim] I'm good, man.

199
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:45,500
I watch
The Breakfast Club all the time.

200
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,250
I watch GaryVee all the time.

201
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,583
- You sound like
a very smart man.

202
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,041
(laughter)
- You've got good taste.

203
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,166
- [Hashim] I'm trying
to get my life in order.

204
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,166
- So what's
you're question, my man?

205
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,083
- [Hashim] Alright,
so my name is Hashim.

206
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,166
I have my wife, Bennetta.

207
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,834
We've been together,
we're high school sweethearts.

208
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:03,208
I have two baby girls right now.

209
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,166
Two-year-old and one-year-old.

210
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,041
Another one, born on the way.

211
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,583
And we've been
documenting our life of Facebook

212
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,792
so far for a while now.

213
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:13,375
- What's a while?

214
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,166
- Since it first came out.

215
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,291
- Okay.

216
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,417
- So you mean you've been--

217
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,250
- [Hashim] Like
there's pictures of us.

218
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,291
- Yeah you've been
putting up pictures.

219
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,125
Okay.

220
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,291
So you mean like
every other person on Earth?

221
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,208
- [Hashim] Yes, yes.

222
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,750
- Okay, I just
wanted to establish that.

223
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,625
- Yeah, my two-year-old daughter

224
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,667
had a video that
had 8,000,000 views

225
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,333
of just her
saying goo goo gah gah.

226
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,125
- Oh God, now you
think she's gonna be famous.

227
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,417
- Well, she is famous.
- [Hashim] Oh it's a definite.

228
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:41,500
I'm an artist, but...

229
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,291
I'm an artist, I'm a filmmaker.

230
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,500
I do as much as I can
to provide for my family.

231
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,458
- So do your thing.

232
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,250
- [Hashim] I do things
that actually get me famous

233
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,417
but my kids are naturals.

234
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:51,542
They became models
and stuff like that.

235
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:52,333
- I love it.

236
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,041
- [Hashim] Now my
question is, how do I monetize

237
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:54,792
something like this?

238
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:57,041
We have a huge following

239
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,959
and I wanna figure out
how do you monetize that.

240
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,125
- Have you had
brand's reach out to you?

241
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,333
- [Hashim] We've
reached out to brands.

242
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,542
My wife does that.

243
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:05,667
She's reached out to
different baby products

244
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:06,500
and stuff like that

245
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,291
and they've been
giving us free things

246
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,750
to take pictures of
us and stuff like that

247
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,417
but--

248
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:13,667
- How many followers
do you have on Instagram

249
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:14,875
and how many
followers do you have

250
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,417
on your Facebook fan page?

251
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:20,959
- [Hashim] On Facebook,
I have 16,000

252
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,875
and on Instagram I have 1,300.

253
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:26,959
- You're not big enough.

254
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,000
- I'm verified on Facebook,
but--

255
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,750
- Yeah, I mean I'm
not even gonna lie.

256
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,166
That's always a
difficult question for me

257
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,957
'cause I don't think you
should try to monetize fame.

258
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:33,957
There's nothing attached to it.

259
00:08:33,957 --> 00:08:35,416
Like, what are you famous for?

260
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:37,082
Like, if she
had an actual skill,

261
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:39,041
or a talent or something--
- [Gary] Well, she does.

262
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,957
I think this is
actually an interesting debate,

263
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:44,625
because I would say escapism

264
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,875
is the fame. Right?

265
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:50,834
So when people say
what is she famous for?

266
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:54,500
Is watching men run
around and throw a ball

267
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,542
into a basket or throw it
around and run over each other,

268
00:08:57,542 --> 00:09:01,625
when was that considered a
huge skill and when wasn't it?

269
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,917
You see where I'm going?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

270
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,417
- It's a really
interesting time, right?

271
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:06,500
Like, what becomes...

272
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,250
It's amazing to
watch America, this market,

273
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,792
make certain things skills.

274
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:15,792
Kids did not get paid to be
good at skateboarding in 1960.

275
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:18,500
They do now because
people will watch it.

276
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,708
So famous for the sake of famous

277
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,041
has been around forever.

278
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,000
An icon named Zsa Zsa Gabor--
- Nah, but they're not though.

279
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,291
- But they are. Zsa Zsa Gabor
wasn't known for anything.

280
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,625
She tried to act.

281
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,250
Everybody can try to act.

282
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,417
I think it just
comes down to attention.

283
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:33,458
- So Zsa Zsa Gabor was
the original Kim Kardashian

284
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,542
is what you're saying?
- One hundred percent.

285
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:36,250
- Okay, got you.
- It's true.

286
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,000
- I just feel like
you still have

287
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,625
to have something
attached to it.

288
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,875
- Listen, the
attach is escapism.

289
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,000
I think if you're pretty,
that's escapism.

290
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,250
Eyes are on you.
It's called modeling.

291
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,792
- Pretty girl privilege.

292
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:48,792
- That's real.
(Cha laughs)

293
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:50,583
That might be actually,
let's take the fame one out.

294
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,500
That might really be the one.
- That might be the one.

295
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,333
- My man, listen.
Here's the punchline.

296
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,792
I think you might
be slightly delusional

297
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:58,333
in a very sweet way.

298
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,792
I can already tell you're
a good guy. You're just...

299
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:02,208
The numbers,
and I haven't even looked at

300
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,125
the engagement rates
against that top line

301
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,542
following account.

302
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:08,500
But, everybody's
got 2,000 followers.

303
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,917
Everybody's got
16,000 followers.

304
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:13,041
You can't monetize
because brands don't think

305
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,000
it's special enough,

306
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,834
because you don't
have enough of attention.

307
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:17,834
You're a TV show, bro.

308
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:18,959
You're a TV show.

309
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,041
You just don't
have enough viewers.

310
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:22,959
- [Hashim] Okay.

311
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,250
- Right? So I think,
of course, you think

312
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,708
your kids are the most talented.

313
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,041
I literally think
my two are as well.

314
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,625
It's just what we do. Right?
- Yeah.

315
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,291
- You've gotta
let the math speak.

316
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,583
It's great that
you're getting free stuff

317
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,417
with those numbers.

318
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:37,542
That means your wife's a
hustler and a salesperson

319
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:38,750
and she's doing her thing.

320
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,000
Getting free
stuff at those numbers

321
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,458
is already an accomplishment.

322
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,875
I kinda wanna hire her.

323
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,667
Send her my way,
because that's a good job

324
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:47,166
for that small of a base.

325
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:51,166
To start getting paid
five, 10, $15,000 by a brand,

326
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,125
you've gotta get those
numbers and engagement up.

327
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,041
Period.

328
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,208
- [Hashim] Alright.
- Alright. Good luck.

329
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,708
- What you said is interesting
too, about escapism though,

330
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,291
'cause I think sometimes
you can have those numbers

331
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,083
just because people are bored.

332
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,083
I don't know if I want people
just to be tuning into me

333
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,333
just because they're bored.

334
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,291
- But they're tuning
into everything because

335
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,917
bored is the slang term for

336
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:10,708
I'm not doing
something right now

337
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,083
and I want to do something else.

338
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,208
You know what's
really interesting?

339
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm also fascinated by
when the political climate

340
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,792
is rough, like it is now,

341
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:18,500
like you know,
when people are scared,

342
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,125
during times of war...

343
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:23,542
So during World War II,
one of the things that grew

344
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:25,417
was the circus.

345
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:27,458
People didn't have
money for porridge.

346
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,625
And they were
going to see the circus,

347
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,166
because when life's hard,

348
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,208
you need to just do
shit that doesn't matter.

349
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,000
Like the Jets.

350
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,500
The Jets means so much
more to me than people realize

351
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,583
because it's the one
place that I really care

352
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,625
about something that
really doesn't matter.

353
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:42,750
- It does, though.

354
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,583
It's a different
level of excitement.

355
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:44,417
You get dressed.

356
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:47,041
- Some people feel
that way about runway shows.

357
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,125
Some people feel that way
about a new album dropping.

358
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,875
Some people feel that
about kids playing hacky sack.

359
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,500
Everybody's got
their different interests.

360
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,375
Rap wasn't music, remember?

361
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,667
Until it was.

362
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:57,333
- Yeah

363
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,583
- Like everybody
tried to dis the new thing.

364
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,417
E-Sports, right,
Instagram models.

365
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:02,083
- [Jonathan] Hello?

366
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:02,792
- Hello, my man
this is GaryVee and

367
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:04,208
you're on The #AskGaryVee Show.

368
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,625
- He said
Instagram models. (laughs)

369
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,917
- [Jonathan] Holy Christ, okay.

370
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,375
- What's your name, man?

371
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,083
- [Jonathan] I'm Jonathan.
- All right, Jonathan.

372
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,625
- [Jonathan] Leclair
from Richland, Washington.

373
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,625
- I love it, man,
what's your question?

374
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,250
- [Jonathan] Okay, so,

375
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,458
when you started
the 2017 Flip Challenge,

376
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,542
I decided to try
doing that selling books.

377
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,834
- Let me just say one thing.

378
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:25,959
Let me say one thing,
Jonathan, I apologize.

379
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:26,792
'Cause it just
has to be mentioned

380
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,166
for everybody who
might not know this.

381
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:32,458
The reason the 2017
Flip Challenge happened

382
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,333
was because I was
on The Breakfast Club,

383
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,375
we were doing our thing,

384
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,667
Envy said, "Okay, give a
practical piece of advice,"

385
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,917
because I'm good,
I didn't fold and feel sad,

386
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:42,375
I came up with one on the spot,
which was go buy stuff

387
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,333
at the dollar
store and thrift stores,

388
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,417
sell stuff in your house,

389
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:47,500
and now there
are tens of thousands

390
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,375
of people selling stuff.

391
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,500
I'm getting
crazy emails of like,

392
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,125
"I had no money, now
I have $4,000,

393
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,083
"'cause I sold all my
clothes that I don't wear."

394
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,250
So it's been huge,
I'm glad you jumped on it,

395
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,417
and thank you, Charlamagne, 
or having me on the show

396
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:01,792
to create that
little micro movement.

397
00:13:01,792 --> 00:13:03,750
Go ahead, Jonathan.

398
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,000
- [Jonathan] Yeah, okay, so
I've made progress on that,

399
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,208
but it's going
slower than I'd like.

400
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,917
I've only made a
couple thousand dollars.

401
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:12,208
- Only made a couple thousand.
- I wanna punch him in the face.

402
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,750
- Oh my God.
- Punch him.

403
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,208
- Only made a couple thousand?

404
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,375
Come on, bro,
how much did you have before?

405
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,333
- Zero!

406
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,417
- [Jonathan] Well, we
put in like 2,000, so.

407
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:23,875
- Okay, and so, good.

408
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:28,417
And so, what's, how
much are you working?

409
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:29,667
Like how much
are you spending time

410
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,208
going to thrift stores
or whatever you're doing

411
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,625
to get these books
and then flipping?

412
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,875
How much time
are you allocating?

413
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,792
- [Jonathan] Not as much for
the results I want right now.

414
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:39,917
- Not as much
time for the results.

415
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:40,708
- That's his fault.

416
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,417
- Okay, okay,
that's fine, keep talking.

417
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,125
- [Jonathan] I wanted
to, because books though,

418
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,708
like the return for the time
wasn't where I want to be.

419
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,792
Me and my
business partner for the,

420
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,667
I guess because we made
a, like, entity around it.

421
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:57,250
- Yep.

422
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,750
- [Jonathan] Anyway, we
wanted to scale up the idea.

423
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,834
And so
essentially just create...

424
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:04,875
So, because for the
book dealing industry,

425
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,291
you have to, like, go to
everyone to get donations.

426
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:07,834
- Yep.

427
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:09,417
Like, Goodwill and
thrift stores and everything.

428
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:10,542
So we just wanted to ask

429
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:12,875
the main stream of
donations ourselves,

430
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,708
and set up a system around that.

431
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,917
Like, create a
book shop/e-com store.

432
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:19,667
So, I was
wondering what your thoughts

433
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:21,834
on the best way
to do that would be.

434
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,792
- Well, if you were
impatient flipping books,

435
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,125
you're about to
get really impatient

436
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,333
because the ambition
you have to build this,

437
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:31,917
to arb out the
Goodwill and the Salvation Army,

438
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:34,667
and Amazon resell is a beast.

439
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:38,000
So, you know, what I would
say is you're gonna need

440
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,333
to really play and
build something big.

441
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,542
It depends on
your ambition, right?

442
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:46,375
So look, to build a
real platform like that,

443
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,375
you're talking about millions
of dollars in development,

444
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:52,583
millions of dollars in
advertising, and a decade.

445
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,625
(Jonathan laughing nervously)

446
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,166
- See, that's the problem with
a lot of these kids nowadays,

447
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,417
they want it now
instead of realizing

448
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:02,208
that you've just gotta
appreciate the process.

449
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,583
- And I'll say
something about Jonathan,

450
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,542
I can tell that him and his
homie wanted to be smarter.

451
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:08,208
They said,
"Wait a minute," Right?

452
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,542
Like, I can feel it from him.

453
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,708
Jonathan, here's what we say,

454
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,333
if you wanna be the
platform that's such a big game,

455
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,250
everybody wants to be
Uber and Airbnb, and Amazon,

456
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,458
and Google, right?

457
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,291
- [Jonathan] I don't
wanna be the platform,

458
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,542
I still wanna use
Amazon for reselling,

459
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:22,917
I just wanna get the donation

460
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:24,417
so I don't have to pay over for
the--

461
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:26,333
- I know that.
You wanna be a platform.

462
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,708
You wanna be a collection
platform for the inventory

463
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:30,667
so you can flip it.

464
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:33,917
The problem is you
have zero awareness.

465
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:35,375
Nobody knows you exist.

466
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,834
And to build a real awareness,

467
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:38,750
you have to spend real
money and do a lot of things,

468
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,917
or be very, very bright,
or things of that nature.

469
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:44,708
I would tell you,
there's a lot of different ways

470
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:45,500
to think about it.

471
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,542
So, for example, you'll
probably succeed quicker

472
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:52,375
if you put up signs on trees
all around your neighborhood

473
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,083
and pay kids
$5 an hour to garage sale

474
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,417
and buy every book, and
arbitrage the garbage out.

475
00:15:58,417 --> 00:15:59,959
- Word.

476
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,333
- [Jonathan] Okay.
- You've gotta be annoying.

477
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,750
You've gotta be
DJ Khaled levels of annoying.

478
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,542
- You've gotta be, "Charlamagne
is a fucking asshole,

479
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:10,542
"but he's my favorite one."
- Absolutely.

480
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:11,959
You've gotta be
a lovable asshole.

481
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:13,834
There's nothing wrong
with selling yourself.

482
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:16,458
- Jonathan, before
you worry about scale,

483
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,291
like, I'm worried
you didn't put enough,

484
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,500
like, one thing
that people don't realize

485
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,708
is there's a lot of
different ways to flip,

486
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:28,250
meaning you went to books.
That homie Rezy Resells made

487
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,083
a lot of money because
he just went all macro.

488
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,125
He just bought every book

489
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,333
and just made the
arb, and then decided

490
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,041
what to do with the bulk books.

491
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,792
Every single person
watching this right now

492
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:40,333
can go to
Marshall's, buy sneakers,

493
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,333
flip them on
Amazon and make money.

494
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,792
Every single one.

495
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:47,333
Now, some people
are happy with $2,000

496
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,417
for 11 hours of work this week.

497
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:51,250
Others aren't.

498
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,417
You've gotta
figure out if reselling

499
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:55,708
fits your ambition,
or if you need

500
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,375
to be doing
something altogether different.

501
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,166
What reselling is
really good for, in my opinion,

502
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:04,000
is for people who wanna
make under 100,000 a year

503
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,665
with the 19 hours a
week that they waste.

504
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:08,082
That's set.

505
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,415
If you get really good,

506
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:11,915
and you're lucky,
I was giving that advice

507
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:13,999
because Envy was
pushing me like, I got nothing,

508
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,915
so I was doing that,
I said dollar store,

509
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:17,082
I was like, six bucks.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

510
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:21,790
- Buy six tchotchkes, make
11 back, go back, buy 11,

511
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,833
11 tchotchkes, 19 back. Go buy
19 tchotchkes, $43 back.

512
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:30,083
When I hear
two kids got 2,000 to start,

513
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,208
you could make,

514
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,875
that's a $10,000
sneaker flip from Marshall's.

515
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:35,875
- I wonder what he wants?

516
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,917
Like, what would be a number
that's a good goal to you?

517
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:41,125
Like, what would you want?
What would make you happy?

518
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,000
- [Jonathan] Well,
what timescale? (laughs)

519
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,375
- Yeah, but,
like, so let's go there.

520
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,792
What's your time worth, bro?

521
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:49,375
What's your time
worth per hour, Jonathan?

522
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,417
- [Jonathan] Like,
this last week?

523
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:55,041
- No, no, you've got
this thought in your mind

524
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,542
of my time is
so fucking valuable

525
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:59,000
that I've gotta
make it efficient.

526
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,166
In your mind, what is
money you wanna make per hour?

527
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,375
- [Jonathan] Well, I don't
have a time worth per hour,

528
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:10,000
I just have a goal for
like, about 15 years from now.

529
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,917
- What's the goal
15 years from now?

530
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:15,583
- [Jonathan] Um, couple
of hundred million. (laughs)

531
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,667
- A couple hundred million.
- Good, man.

532
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:20,625
- [Jonathan] Not like, I have
an actual specific number,

533
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,291
440, but that's good enough,

534
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,125
my ambition is to go to Mars.

535
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,291
- To go to Mars?
- [Jonathan] Yeah.

536
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:33,291
- Dude, so like, you're telling
me your ultimate ambition

537
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,959
is to go to Mars, not
the 440 million, right?

538
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,583
- [Jonathan] But I want
the money to be able to

539
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,875
make sure I have
three times as much needed.

540
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,291
- So you're
hustling to go to Mars.

541
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,291
The way Gary
hustles to buy the Jets,

542
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,667
he's hustling to got to Mars.

543
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,083
There's nothing wrong with that.
- No, I'm super happy.

544
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,834
Johnathan, I think
you should document.

545
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:53,208
You should literally document
your journey to Mars, bro.

546
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,458
I'll watch it.

547
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,708
(Cha laughs)

548
00:18:57,959 --> 00:19:01,041
Alright man, good luck,
let's move on.

549
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,667
Listen, I think
that would, listen.

550
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:05,375
- That's the interrupt,
I've never heard that before.

551
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,625
He's selling books
because he wants to

552
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,166
fly to another world.

553
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,834
(group laughter)

554
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:13,208
- Let's get one more,
let's get one more.

555
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,959
Listen, I think look,

556
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,959
let's make this
valuable for everybody.

557
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:18,875
Jonathan is super valuable

558
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,750
to so many of you
the same way Taylor

559
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,125
really hit a nerve
for so many of you.

560
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:27,625
Jonathan is so worried about
something so macro, so macro.

561
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:31,667
Do you know how much I worry
about buying the New York Jets?

562
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:33,083
Goose egg.

563
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,875
Robert Parish.

564
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,375
It's what I'd like to happen,
but I don't think about it

565
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,917
every second,
every little transaction.

566
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:41,917
Macro transactions,
when I sold a piece

567
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:44,125
of this fucking
empire to Stephen Ross,

568
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,166
I thought about that because
he's the owner of the Dolphins.

569
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,375
And that whole thing.

570
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,750
But not on every
little transaction,

571
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,250
not when I was selling
books, now when I was doing

572
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:51,875
every little thing.

573
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,875
Stephanie Land, my ghost writer.
The best in the game.

574
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,208
Did you use a ghost writer?

575
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,583
- No I wrote--

576
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,291
- You wrote,
okay, I'm impressed.

577
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,458
Stephanie's responsible
for all four of those things

578
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,333
actually becoming a real thing.

579
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,417
Who's this?
- [Andy] Shonronda.

580
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:07,667
- Shonronda?

581
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:08,458
- [Shonronda] Hello?

582
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,625
- Hello, this is GaryVee 
and you're on

583
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,875
The #AskGaryVee Show
with Charlamagne Tha God.

584
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,166
- What's up Shonronda?

585
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:16,625
- [Shonronda] Ahhh get the
fuck outta here, oh my God.

586
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,542
Yo, that's crazy. Yo,
y'all are like the cool, most,

587
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:22,750
like my most favorite
people ever, like ever.

588
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,375
- That's dope.

589
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,208
- [Shonronda] Like,
it's so crazy.

590
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,917
I never even put my number
in here before, until today.

591
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:29,125
Like, that's crazy.

592
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,250
- Wait a minute, wait
a minute, wait a minute!

593
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,542
You've never put
your number before?

594
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:34,083
You didn't love me enough
to put your number before.

595
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,375
It took
Charlamagne to actually do it?

596
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,875
- [Shonronda] No, I never
really watched it live because

597
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,583
I always listen to you at work.

598
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,875
- Respect. I appreciate it.

599
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,458
- [Shonronda] But I'm
always like watching the video.

600
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,375
I don't ever watch it live,
but today it just so happens

601
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,583
that I was able
to watch it live.

602
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,125
- True, true, true.

603
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,166
- Alright, what's your question?

604
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,625
And what's your
name? I didn't catch it.

605
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,542
- [Shonronda] Okay,
it's Shonronda.

606
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:58,500
- Shonronda. Got it, great.
What's your question?

607
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,458
- [Shonronda] Okay, ah God,
my mind just went blank, okay.

608
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:07,500
Okay, one question I have
for, Charlamagne, right?

609
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,417
- [Gary] Yep.
- Yes.

610
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:12,500
- [Shonronda] Okay,
I preordered a book already.

611
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,208
- Thank you!

612
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,250
- [Shonronda] The
Black Privilege book.

613
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,917
- Appreciate that.
- [Gary] Everyone should.

614
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:17,875
- [Shonronda] And Gary I have
all of your books already,

615
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,458
every one that came out so far.

616
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,750
- [Gary] Stephanie's very happy.

617
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,375
- [Shonronda] So for
Charlamagne, I know that you're

618
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,417
a big believer in The Secret.
- Absolutely.

619
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:29,458
- [Shonronda] Stuff like that.

620
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:33,458
So, my thing is, I think
that, how do you feel about

621
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:37,625
coming out with like, a
documentary video that's

622
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,417
something like The Secret but
more for the quote unquote

623
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:41,959
urban type areas?

624
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:44,083
'Cause I feel like
that's something that

625
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:47,083
the black community in
particular is missing out on,

626
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:51,583
as far as keeping your your
energy high, being positive,

627
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:52,750
stuff like that.

628
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,417
And I think that would change
a lot of what's going on

629
00:21:56,417 --> 00:22:00,166
in society.
- Yeah, you're absolutely right.

630
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,375
That's why I named by
book Black Privilege, because

631
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,834
I said that we have to
start finding privilege

632
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:06,417
in ourselves, we have
to start realizing that

633
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:08,500
we're special too,
and that's how I grew up,

634
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,667
I grew up with them
teaching me about black power,

635
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:13,208
and black pride, and black
excellence, and black kings,

636
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,458
and the black man is God.
- And who did that?

637
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,375
- Just studying,
studying like the Five Percent.

638
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,959
- But what about
your inner circle?

639
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:22,333
- Yeah, my father, my
father always kept me watching

640
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,625
Elijah Muhammad videos, and
Minister Farrakhan videos,

641
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,750
they just kept pushing
black excellence in my head.

642
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,834
So that's actually why I
named my book Black Privilege,

643
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:31,792
for that exact reason,
because I feel like we have to

644
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:33,667
change our mindset,
because everything starts

645
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:34,500
with a mindset.

646
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,834
Like if you wake up in
the morning and you feel like

647
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:38,250
you can't do something,
it won't get done.

648
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,333
And I feel like all
this talk of white supremacy

649
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,875
and white privilege,
which is very real, has created

650
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,917
a black inferiority
complex in our people,

651
00:22:44,917 --> 00:22:47,375
so that's exactly why I named
my book Black Privilege,

652
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,500
and then the subtitle
is very important too,

653
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,875
opportunity comes
to those who create it.

654
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,500
So I feel like we can start
creating our own opportunities

655
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,834
simply by changing our mindset.

656
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,834
That's exactly why I named
my book Black Privilege.

657
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:02,500
- There's two ways to build
the biggest building in town.

658
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,458
One is to build the
biggest building in town,

659
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:06,959
and that's what
you're talking about.

660
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:09,959
The other is to tear down
everybody else's building.

661
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:12,542
And I think when you
talk about black privilege

662
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:16,083
or white privilege,
when you peel away at that,

663
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,583
94% of the people are trying to

664
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:20,750
tear people's buildings down.

665
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,834
People hear black privilege,
and I've been watching

666
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,542
how people have been
acting, they think that comes

667
00:23:24,542 --> 00:23:26,041
at the cost of
somebody who's white, or Asian.

668
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,750
- Not true.
- That's crazy!

669
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,041
When people
hear white privilege,

670
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,917
look, I understand
the macro belief that

671
00:23:32,917 --> 00:23:34,708
it comes at the cost of,

672
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:37,625
except the people that have
the mindset of black privilege!

673
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,291
This is not a black-white,
girl-boy issue.

674
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,250
This is a
positive-negative issue.

675
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,417
- That's it. That's it.

676
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:45,583
And we all
have divine privilege,

677
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:47,125
because we're all here!

678
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,041
Listen, I know I keep
going back to this but I.

679
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:49,917
- [Gary] 400 trillion to one.

680
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:51,083
- That's it,
400 trillion to one,

681
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,875
I love when Gary says
that because it's so real,

682
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,583
you almost gotta
see it for yourself.

683
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:58,792
Next time you have sex
and the guy busts off on you,

684
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:03,000
just look at all those sperm
cells and realize only one

685
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,792
can be a child!

686
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:04,625
- But wait a minute,
wait a minute,

687
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:05,500
knowing a little
bit about sperm,

688
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,917
enough to talk about this,

689
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:08,291
how are you
actually able to see it?

690
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:11,583
You don't take it and
put it into a microscope.

691
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:12,583
You can't really see it.

692
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,166
- You never busted
off on a girl, Gary?

693
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,000
What you mean?

694
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,625
- No no, of course,
but you can't see.

695
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:18,458
- Oh, because they swim.

696
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,834
- You can't see the
four hundred trillion sperms.

697
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,417
- Oh, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
- You can't either!

698
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:22,250
- You right.

699
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,375
- What are you like, take it
and putting it on a microscope?

700
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,583
What, have you got a
microscope by your bed?

701
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:27,834
- I just assume when I look
at it, when it's on my wife,

702
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:30,917
I'm like that's 400 trillion.
(group laughter)

703
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:32,834
I just assume.

704
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:36,208
- [Gary] So did we
answer the question?

705
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,375
- [Shonronda] Yes,
yes, Charlamagne did.

706
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:39,834
Can I ask you a question, Gary?

707
00:24:39,834 --> 00:24:42,083
- Of course, go fast.

708
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,959
- [Shonronda] Okay,
I've been trying to start

709
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:45,542
a beekeeper company.

710
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:46,708
- A beekeeper?

711
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:48,792
- [Shonronda] Yeah, a beekeeper.

712
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:49,625
- Wooooow.

713
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:54,041
This is dope, this is new ideas.

714
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:56,750
- Where's my honey? Go ahead.

715
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,417
- [Shonronda] What do
you think would be a good way

716
00:24:58,417 --> 00:24:59,417
to kind of promote that?

717
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:03,333
I'm trying to do urban
beekeeping and stuff like that,

718
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:07,917
I'm trying to push that to the

719
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:09,291
urban and black communities.

720
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:10,583
- I don't like that word, urban.

721
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:12,208
Why does
everything have to be urban?

722
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,708
- [Shonronda] I know you don't.

723
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:15,166
I just hate to be so,

724
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:16,417
'cause it's not
just black people

725
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:18,041
in particular that
I'm talking about.

726
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:22,083
It's black people,
Mexicans, Spanish people.

727
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,625
- Yeah and there's not black
bees, Mexican bees, white bees.

728
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,208
Bees are bees.

729
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:27,959
If people got a bee problem,

730
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,917
they gonna want
you to help them.

731
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:31,625
- [Gary] Well, you
didn't call it Human Privilege.

732
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,333
- That's true. (laughs)

733
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:34,875
- [Shonronda]
People in urban areas.

734
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:37,542
- Listen, listen, listen.
Real quick.

735
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:39,417
If you wanna be
the black beekeeper,

736
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:40,708
I think that's brilliant.

737
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:42,291
Are you good at it?

738
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,208
- [Shonronda] I'm
trying to be. (laughs)

739
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,625
- Well let's start there.

740
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:51,000
It doesn't matter if you're
black, white, rich, or poor:

741
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,208
if you stink at your
skill, you're gonna lose.

742
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:56,166
- [Shonronda] Okay.

743
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:58,917
- So, before you try to build
this brand, why don't you

744
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:01,917
go work for a beekeeper
for a year, and get taught

745
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:04,041
the proper way to be one?

746
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:05,792
- [Shonronda] Okay.

747
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:07,333
- Yeah, because you ain't
gonna convince no black people

748
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,083
that they need a beekeeper.

749
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,500
That's just an
expense I don't need.

750
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,959
I'm gonna be honest with you.

751
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:14,291
- [Shonronda] I kinda know that.
I kinda figured that.

752
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:15,333
- [Gary] No, no, but
listen, can I ask you

753
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,667
a really interesting question?

754
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:18,458
'Cause now I'm excited.

755
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:21,959
Is there a a reason
you want to do that?

756
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,125
You like bees?

757
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,125
Tell the truth.

758
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,375
You think there's money in it?

759
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:29,959
Somebody once
told you something?

760
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:31,917
- [Shonronda] Truthfully, I
know that there's money in it.

761
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:35,291
Because there's a lot more to
the beehive than just honey.

762
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:36,125
- I agree.

763
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:39,166
- [Shonronda] You
got propolis, you got,

764
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:42,500
there's a lot of stuff,
there's beeswax, royal jelly.

765
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,625
There's a lot to it.

766
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:45,458
And then the services
that come along with it,

767
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,291
like bee removal, pollination.

768
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:48,583
- Listen, my young man.

769
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:50,333
Listen, I like
that answer a whole lot.

770
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,542
I'm gonna give you a very.

771
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:53,375
How old are you? 22.

772
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,625
- [Shonronda] No, 30.
- Nice.

773
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:58,458
You're a very, very young man.

774
00:26:58,458 --> 00:26:59,917
Go work for a beekeeper.

775
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:00,959
- I think that's a woman, Gary.

776
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:03,166
- [Gary] Oh, sorry, are you?

777
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:05,875
- [Shonronda] Yeah.
- I apologize, thank you.

778
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:07,250
- [Shonronda] Yeah
I get that all the time.

779
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,125
- Trust me, good news,

780
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:09,875
I get the reverse
of it all the time too.

781
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,125
I call down to the
hotel and they're like,

782
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:12,834
your towels will
be right up, ma'am.

783
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:15,041
(Cha laughs)

784
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:17,917
Listen to me, you are
an extremely young woman.

785
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:21,834
Go work for somebody for
two years, learn the craft,

786
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:23,000
and do your thing.

787
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,041
You can be on a 10 year
mission, you'll be 40 years old,

788
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:28,166
a year younger than
me, how old are you?

789
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:30,625
- I'll be 37 this year, I think.

790
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:33,417
- A few years older than
Cha, and you can absolutely

791
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:35,834
win this game, but you're
not gonna convince anybody

792
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:38,166
about anything unless
you are actually the part.

793
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:41,792
We are living through the
greatest fronting PR moves

794
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:43,959
of all time because
people think taking the pictures

795
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:45,583
on Instagram proves it.

796
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:48,417
It does not, and if you have
a passion for this, and you

797
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,792
gave a great answer,
you actually understand

798
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:52,125
there's something there.

799
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:54,917
I need you to
actually then get good at it,

800
00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:58,291
and then you can
actually succeed.

801
00:27:58,291 --> 00:27:59,750
- [Shonronda] Okay,
sounds great.

802
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,750
Thank y'all so much, man.

803
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,625
- Great, thank you
so much, thank you.

804
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,250
- I only know one
person who had a bee problem,

805
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,375
and that was Dr. Oz,
because when you go to

806
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:08,667
the Dr. Oz show, he
gives you jars of honey.

807
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:10,208
And the reason he started
giving out jars of honey is

808
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:13,000
because he had a bee problem,
so he hired some beekeepers to

809
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,917
come in, and they came in
and started keeping the bees,

810
00:28:15,917 --> 00:28:18,375
and now he
harvests his own honey.

811
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:22,000
- Do you know honey's actually
one of the only things in

812
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,125
the world that I don't like?

813
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:27,333
- I love honey, I put honey
in my green tea every morning.

814
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:29,542
- And I'm trying to
make myself like it.

815
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:31,917
Because I did
that with cilantro.

816
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:34,333
I didn't like it, and
then I just kept eating it

817
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,333
until I loved it.

818
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,041
- I don't even know what
cilantro is, when you said that

819
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,250
I though that was the
dude that sang Whip Nae Nae.

820
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,542
(Gary laughs)
(phone ringing)

821
00:28:42,542 --> 00:28:44,625
- [Andy] Miguel.

822
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:49,875
- Coriander?

823
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:50,708
- [Miguel] This is Miguel.

824
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:51,959
- Miguel, this is GaryVee
and you're on

825
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:54,959
The #AskGaryVee Show
with Charlamagne Tha God.

826
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:57,667
- [Miguel] Man, ridiculous,
Charlamagne what's going on?

827
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:58,959
GaryVee, thanks so
much for giving me a call.

828
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:00,166
- What's up, brother?

829
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,834
- Of course my man,
what's your question?

830
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:05,000
- [Miguel] Alright, so
I'm a beginning Loan Officer

831
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,375
in the state of Arizona.

832
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:11,458
Alright, so I'm an analytics
guy, I'm one of those cats that

833
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,041
you look at my Instagram
I have 500 people following me

834
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:16,834
and I get 120,
130 likes per post.

835
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:18,250
That makes me happy, right?

836
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,083
- Okay?

837
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:21,333
- [Miguel] So, I'm
trying to jump that up.

838
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:23,834
I'm trying to be patient,
I have to learn patience

839
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:25,834
from you Gary like
nobody's fucking business.

840
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:27,875
- I don't think Gary has
patience to be honest with you.

841
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,542
- [Gary] I surely do.

842
00:29:29,542 --> 00:29:32,667
- [Miguel] Patience
is my worst enemy by far.

843
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:36,166
I would stab myself
in the foot if I could,

844
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:38,041
not to waste something.
- [Gary] Mhmmm.

845
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:40,000
- [Miguel] So that's my question
- That's the problem.

846
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,250
You think you're wasting,
you haven't calibrated time.

847
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,041
Charlamagne's
making a joke but like,

848
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:48,375
I'm so macro patient it's crazy.

849
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:52,542
I think in 30, 40, 50,
60 year terms all the time.

850
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:54,041
It's the only way I think.

851
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,750
And so you think
you're wasting time

852
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,667
and I'm thinking that
I'm picking up context.

853
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:01,000
When I'm doing things
that don't get instant results,

854
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,625
that 99% of people
think is wasting time,

855
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:06,250
I'm happy because I'm
getting data from the reaction.

856
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,834
If you're such an analytics
guy, you're an analytics guy

857
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:11,959
on the math front, you're
not an analytics guy in life.

858
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:13,583
If you're an analytics guy
- [Miguel] Right.

859
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:15,417
- In life you
understand that all the things

860
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:18,500
that are doing things that
don't create instant results

861
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,750
are frameworks and
bricks to the reality

862
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,083
of what you're building.

863
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:23,959
- Yeah I gotta
chapter in my book, and then

864
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:26,125
the whole chapter's
basically based off of there's

865
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,708
no such thing as losses in life.

866
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:29,583
You either win or you learn.

867
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:31,083
So it's like if you're
not getting the results

868
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:32,250
you want in that
moment you should

869
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,875
be learning
something from that experience.

870
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,166
- Let's take a step back.

871
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,708
It's imperative
that you figure out

872
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:38,500
who you're
trying to prove this to.

873
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,083
Patience comes--
- Myself.

874
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:41,792
- Yeah so I think
- [Miguel] Myself, 100%.

875
00:30:41,792 --> 00:30:42,667
- Great, then you need to start

876
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:44,375
loving yourself
a whole lot more.

877
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,208
- Absolutely.

878
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:46,333
- You're judging
the shit out of yourself

879
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:47,875
in a very poor way.
- [Miguel] Hell yeah,

880
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:49,208
I'm so critical to myself.

881
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:51,917
I'm fucking critical to myself
and if I have to learn that,

882
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,375
a whole lot more
too because now this

883
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:56,917
is my first 100%
commission job, gig, ever.

884
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:57,667
- Right.

885
00:30:57,667 --> 00:31:01,625
So for me coming from
that corporate mindset to,

886
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:02,875
fuck if I don't
go out there and

887
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:04,875
work and actually
did my job now,

888
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,875
I'm gonna shoot
myself in the foot.

889
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,834
So that in itself is a
fucking piece of me saying

890
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,708
- The other--
- Why do hate your feet, bro?

891
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:12,000
You wanna stab
yourself in the foot,

892
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,333
shoot yourself in the foot?

893
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,875
What's wrong wit your foot?

894
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,000
- [Miguel] Charlamagne
what happens when

895
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,667
you can't walk right, bro?

896
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,458
It fucks up your day,
it fucks up your life.

897
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:21,458
It fucks up your mentality,
you can't run, you can't jump.

898
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:22,375
- Yeah.
- [Miguel] That's why

899
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:22,959
I always joke about my feet.

900
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:23,625
- That's so weird.

901
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:25,875
This is a funny thing about
mindsets, when you said that

902
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:27,834
I was like, I would
dominate on a wheelchair.

903
00:31:27,834 --> 00:31:29,291
(Cha laughs)

904
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:32,667
- [Gary] It was weird, I swear,
it's super funny like I--

905
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:33,875
- That's why Gary can't lose.

906
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:34,708
- You know what?

907
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,291
I think that's right man.
- Isn't that right man.

908
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:38,458
It was really interesting
to me, I heard you say that

909
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:39,959
and was like man if
I was in a wheelchair,

910
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:41,500
I would milk the shit out of it.

911
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,250
I would create stuff.
(Cha chuckles)

912
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,375
- I would like, I would
come up with a sneaker brand

913
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,667
which would then be funny.

914
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:49,458
You know like, I would do stuff.

915
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:51,333
- That's funny cause
Professor X was in a wheelchair

916
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:53,000
but he was the
leader of the X-Men, no!

917
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,959
But he was the thinker.
- [Gary] I get it.

918
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:55,583
- He was the thinker.

919
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:56,625
- [Gary] My man I think there--
- That makes perfect sense

920
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:57,458
Because, that
makes perfect sense

921
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:00,125
that you say that too because
it's a smart, smart market

922
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,792
you can make
yourself go into it,

923
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,917
I understand what you're saying.

924
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:03,750
- Listen my man

925
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,625
- [Miguel] I need a
Fitbit and I turn it up

926
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:05,542
a little bit more on here.

927
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:07,542
- I'm telling you,
you're beating yourself up.

928
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:10,834
You're beating yourself
up, which means immediately

929
00:32:10,834 --> 00:32:12,250
you're set up to lose.

930
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,458
So for example I'm listening
to you and I like your vibe,

931
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:16,000
and I'm like dammit,
he's probably not gonna

932
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,375
be successful at this thing.

933
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:18,250
'Cause that's
what I defaulted to,

934
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,000
I'm always ready for the loss.

935
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,792
And I'm saying when
he's not gonna be successful

936
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:24,250
at this 100% commission
job, he's gonna go through

937
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,750
a shitty phase cause
he came from corporate

938
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,417
where he was protected, he
went out into the real world.

939
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:30,458
I have no idea what
he's selling, right?

940
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:32,792
He may be selling that's not
that good of an item to sell,

941
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:35,166
he might not be good
at selling that item.

942
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:37,959
And he's gonna decide in nine
months that he's not good,

943
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:39,333
and that's gonna
take him three, four years

944
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,542
to get out of that cloud.

945
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,583
And so I'm sitting
here nervous Miguel,

946
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:45,125
I'm kinda happy you called.

947
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:48,375
Because if I could do anything,
please do this for me.

948
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:52,250
When you fail at this 100%
commission thing, be happy.

949
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,208
And that is gonna be so
ridiculously hard for you,

950
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:58,875
I can taste it already,
but remember I said that.

951
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:00,917
Today, tomorrow
and 10 weeks from now.

952
00:33:00,917 --> 00:33:01,875
What do you say

953
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:03,041
about that?
- I think I kinda fore,

954
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:04,875
I kinda forecasted
that on my own too cause

955
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:06,208
I like to, again, analytics.

956
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:08,625
And seeing myself and
analyzing myself often.

957
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:10,250
And I had a position open up

958
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,542
to me this last week for a team.

959
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:14,583
Which, I mean a lot of
the marketing shit would

960
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:15,583
get off my own back.

961
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:17,750
But, at the same
time I was learning.

962
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,291
And I heard you say
that a couple weeks ago,

963
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:22,542
sometimes you have to take
a step back so you can learn

964
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,291
your trades become a tradesman.

965
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:26,291
I learnt in a now,
I haven't been in mortgage

966
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:28,500
since September last year, bro.

967
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,708
I can sell (inaudible)
if I really want to.

968
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:33,125
But at the end of the day,
not everybody needs a mortgage

969
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:34,250
every single fucking
minute of their lives.

970
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,291
- That's real
- [Gary] Yep.

971
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:36,125
That's exactly right
- So.

972
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:36,959
- You either win

973
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:38,542
or you learn man.
- And another thing too that,

974
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:40,166
- [Miguel] The industry
that I'm in is so fucking

975
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:43,375
detail-making goal, from A to Z,
so many different options,

976
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:46,458
that it's really
impossible for me right now,

977
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,166
nine, three, four
months in the way,

978
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:50,708
that I'll learn everything
because I won't see that much

979
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:51,667
business come through my

980
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:53,417
pipeline to be
able to learn from.

981
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:55,291
So, I jump back I'm like--
- So, so.

982
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:56,375
Take a step back
- It makes me feel like a fool

983
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:58,250
- Let's, we're
being very logical here.

984
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,959
So, if that's all
true, which it is,

985
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:05,750
why are you judging
yourself on the first quarter

986
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,667
in a triple overtime game?

987
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:09,333
You gotta do this
for a decade before

988
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,750
you can decide if you did it.

989
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:14,417
- [Miguel] Right, I
guess I'm just being

990
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:16,583
too fucking
critical of myself, I'm just,

991
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:18,083
I'm not sure I fucking went.
- You know so,

992
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:19,458
you know what's so
crazy about patience?

993
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:20,417
- [Gary] No, no, real
quick I apologize,

994
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:21,250
please don't forget,

995
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,166
'cause I'm gonna get
yelled at for interrupting you.

996
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:27,417
You wanna win quick.

997
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:30,875
If you just wanted
to win, you'd be calm.

998
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:32,375
- Yeah.
- I'm super calm

999
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:33,625
'cause I just wanna win.

1000
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:34,833
- You know you will.
- I just.

1001
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:37,250
I just know it's a 50 year game.

1002
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,166
The hell am I getting
excited or bent outta shape of?

1003
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:42,208
When I met Steph Land,
'cause she's here

1004
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:43,917
and I like using
anything that's in the room.

1005
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:45,833
Right?
People, products.

1006
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,250
We were talking about
social media, Crush It!

1007
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,833
In 2008, cause
it came out in '09.

1008
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,833
I will never
forget that meeting Steph.

1009
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:53,875
I was talking about
stuff that nobody knew what it,

1010
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:56,917
what like, you
understood it cause you'd work

1011
00:34:56,917 --> 00:34:58,959
with Seth Godin and stuff,
you were right for me.

1012
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:01,291
'Cause you
understood it conceptually,

1013
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:03,708
but the details
in it was like silly.

1014
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:06,458
- Well it was just,
can this really be done?

1015
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:07,625
- [Gary] Right.
- Or you're the anomaly.

1016
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:09,041
- [Gary] Right.
- That was the question.

1017
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:10,041
- You know what, thank you.

1018
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,417
I remember sitting
there writing Crush It!

1019
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:15,959
And feeling the cynicism from
the team, not in a bad way,

1020
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:18,083
'cause everybody was very nice,
as you can see she's lovely.

1021
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,166
But it was like,
no but wait a minute.

1022
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:22,708
No you can't you on YouTube
and Twitter and just live

1023
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:23,750
your dream like.

1024
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,959
Like is this?
- [Stephanie] Well you could

1025
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:25,917
obviously you could do it.
- Right.

1026
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:26,750
If you were somebody

1027
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,583
- And somebody else do it.
- Right.

1028
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,083
And what I knew was the
long tail would be there.

1029
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:31,583
I knew there would be
the hundreds of thousands

1030
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:34,500
of people on Instagram
right now making 71,000,

1031
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,708
89,000, not everybody's
gonna make a trillion.

1032
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:40,083
So, dude you gotta be patient.

1033
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:42,542
You're not doing it
'cause you just wanna win,

1034
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:45,792
you're doing it
'cause you wanna win fast.

1035
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,875
- Yeah, and I
thought I basically

1036
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:49,125
was gonna have
the same sentiment.

1037
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:51,875
The thing about life is
you can't fast-forward life.

1038
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:53,583
It's gonna take,
it's gonna be five years,

1039
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,834
it's gonna be 10 years,
the hours, 60 minutes.

1040
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:57,917
We can't speed up the process

1041
00:35:57,917 --> 00:36:00,000
regardless of how
much we think we can.

1042
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,959
So you just gotta
live the process out.

1043
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:04,834
- [Miguel] Word, well
I appreciate you guys.

1044
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:05,750
Man, keep on killin it.
- Alright, my man.

1045
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,375
Take care yourself.

1046
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:07,125
- [Miguel] I love
you're confident.

1047
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:09,542
- Thank you.

1048
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,083
- GaryVee.

1049
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:12,625
- [Gary] A real pleasure, man.
- Thank you, man.

1050
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:14,083
Listen, I need to
sell 100,000 books

1051
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:15,667
in my first week like GaryVee.

1052
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:17,375
- [Gary] 104.
- Okay, 104.

1053
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,417
What's the exact number, 104?

1054
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:20,500
- No actually 100, was it 100?

1055
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,417
And 500, 100?

1056
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:24,166
- 100 and?
- [Gary] Top left number 549?

1057
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:25,375
- Yeah.
- [Gary] Top left number.

1058
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:28,083
- That's an amazing
feat by the way.

1059
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:30,000
- [Iris] 100,549.

1060
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,583
- And that's for
The #AskGaryVee book.

1061
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:34,291
- Let's help this
man sell 100,550 books

1062
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:35,333
so he can always make fun of me.

1063
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,583
- Black Privilege: Opportunity
Comes to Those Who Create It,

1064
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:39,333
it's eight principles
that I've learned in my life

1065
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:41,125
that I'm sharing
with the people.

1066
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,542
Okay, I'm not an
expert at anything,

1067
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:44,875
I just got a little experience
in life because I've lived.

1068
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:47,083
And that's all you can ask for
once you live a little bit.

1069
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:48,208
- [Gary] You lived a little.
- I've lived a little,

1070
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:50,000
that's it, that's
it I've lived a little.

1071
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,959
- [Gary] Question of
the day, ask him.

1072
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,375
You get to ask a
question of the day,

1073
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:53,458
any question you want.

1074
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:55,542
They'll answer and
get thousands of answers.

1075
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:57,083
This might be a time
to do market research,

1076
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,708
this might be an
opportunity to see

1077
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:02,083
something you're curious
about, this is your shot.

1078
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:03,959
- My question is simple,

1079
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:05,542
do you believe that there is

1080
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:07,250
such a thing as black privilege?

1081
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,834
Like do you
believe that you can find

1082
00:37:08,834 --> 00:37:10,583
privilege in your blackness?

1083
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:13,583
- And can we use Blackness
as an all-encompassing?

1084
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:14,291
- Yeah.

1085
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:17,291
Can we see it as a
perceived shortcoming?

1086
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:18,542
'Cause that's what it is.

1087
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:19,708
- Yeah it's perceived
as a shortcoming.

1088
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:21,250
I mean I want people
even when they see this,

1089
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,625
I don't want
them to think that the

1090
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:24,083
book is just for black
people because it's not.

1091
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:26,041
It's for anybody who's
ever feel marginalized,

1092
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:27,375
anybody has ever felt depressed,

1093
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:30,000
anybody who feels
like they lack privilege.

1094
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,542
Like I feel like it's a divine.

1095
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:32,375
- [Gary] I've
got Jets privilege.

1096
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,417
- You got Jets privilege.
- [Gary] I mean it.

1097
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,917
All these Giants
fans run around,

1098
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:36,625
they think
they're so cool and happy.

1099
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,834
What they don't realize
is the Yankees and Rangers

1100
00:37:38,834 --> 00:37:40,041
won championships for me

1101
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:41,834
and I dropped
them like a bad habit.

1102
00:37:41,834 --> 00:37:43,125
And now I'm all
about the Knicks and Jets

1103
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:44,542
because I love to climb.

1104
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:45,500
(Cha laughs)

1105
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,708
So you Giant fans,
you have it bad.

1106
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:49,250
Patriot fans
think they're so good.

1107
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,834
I laugh at all these
kids running around when

1108
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:52,375
they had their
self-esteem wrapped up

1109
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:53,500
in their football team.

1110
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,333
- You know what's
so funny about that?

1111
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:55,125
- [Gary] Who
gives a shit if your

1112
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,500
football team is good?
Are you good, mother fucker?

1113
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,041
- I'm a Dallas Cowboys fan.

1114
00:37:58,041 --> 00:37:59,333
So I always tell Patriots fans,

1115
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:00,166
there's going to
come a point where ya'll

1116
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:02,250
down for like five, six years.

1117
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,458
It's going to happen.

1118
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:05,125
Trust me.
We dominated the 90's.

1119
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,166
- [Gary] When that
mother fucker retires

1120
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:07,250
at 50 years old.
- Yeah.

1121
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,708
- [Gary] Fucking piece of shit.
- Absolutely.

1122
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:10,750
Thank you for having me, Gary.

1123
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,291
- [Gary] You keep
asking questions,

1124
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,125
we'll keep answering them.
- My man.

1125
00:38:14,125 --> 00:00:00,000
(hip hop music)
