1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:03,320
- Vlog, this is a fairly uneventful

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,632
vlog.

3
00:00:04,632 --> 00:00:06,579
Babin, we're gonna have to figure out

4
00:00:06,579 --> 00:00:09,606
some random shit right now, which we will.

5
00:00:09,606 --> 00:00:11,651
I'll come up with some
crazy rant but first,

6
00:00:11,651 --> 00:00:14,234
(hip-hop beat)

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,197
(upbeat electronic beat)

8
00:00:30,048 --> 00:00:31,284
Hey guys, good morning.

9
00:00:31,284 --> 00:00:34,913
Here in Houston, big ups, congrats to the

10
00:00:34,913 --> 00:00:39,492
Astros, big championship,
what up Little Lou.

11
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:41,325
Full day with clients.

12
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:43,925
We made bunch of phone calls,

13
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:47,404
all internal Vayner, VaynerMedia stuff.

14
00:00:47,404 --> 00:00:50,550
Show Jeff real quick, he hates it.

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,192
Jeff Nicholson, our
incredible Chief Media Officer

16
00:00:54,192 --> 00:00:56,014
and I got a lot of work
done on the flight out here

17
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,589
for a 6:00 a.m. flight,
that was pretty epic.

18
00:00:57,589 --> 00:00:58,646
I actually think the air--

19
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:00,696
Actually vlog, airport hack.

20
00:01:00,696 --> 00:01:02,373
I think more people should take flights

21
00:01:02,373 --> 00:01:03,554
just to have meetings and then leave.

22
00:01:03,554 --> 00:01:06,418
Like sometimes, that's our y-positive.

23
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:09,039
We'll do it much more on the way back.

24
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:11,796
Great holiday weekend, life is good,

25
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:14,321
super pumped how well the
Permission video is doing.

26
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:16,066
What permission are you looking for?

27
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:18,069
I'm just so tired of, you know,

28
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:20,132
so many people are using me right now

29
00:01:20,132 --> 00:01:21,731
to give them permission to do stuff

30
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:23,412
and it is my literally, my literally

31
00:01:23,412 --> 00:01:24,891
greatest feeling of my life.

32
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:26,550
If you haven't seen it, check it out.

33
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,913
Very fired up about today's Cyber Monday.

34
00:01:28,913 --> 00:01:30,573
I know you guys are seeing
this Wednesday or Tuesday,

35
00:01:30,573 --> 00:01:32,171
I don't know what you guys are doing but,

36
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:34,078
Cyber Monday offer on my
new book, Crushing It,

37
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:34,911
it's gonna be phenomenal.

38
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:36,778
Big Cyber Monday deal going on today.

39
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:38,984
If you're planning on
buying Crushing It, my book,

40
00:01:38,984 --> 00:01:40,728
today is the day to do it.

41
00:01:40,728 --> 00:01:45,302
I'm doing a buy five books,
get entered into a contest.

42
00:01:45,302 --> 00:01:48,066
Five of you are getting,

43
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,077
five of you are getting dinner
with me in New York City.

44
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,714
And just a lot of themes, right?

45
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:54,648
You know, you saw Cyber Monday and

46
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,317
well, I'm already assuming it.

47
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:59,060
You know, Black Friday and I
assume today on Cyber Monday,

48
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,596
just incredible, dominant maneuvering to

49
00:02:03,596 --> 00:02:06,247
retail happening online and communication

50
00:02:06,247 --> 00:02:09,489
and your media consumption patterns,

51
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:11,419
you know the internet
is eating up the world

52
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:14,685
and you need to be on the
right side of that history.

53
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:17,369
Working on 003, the sneaker launch,

54
00:02:17,369 --> 00:02:18,985
this is just a little bit of an update,

55
00:02:18,985 --> 00:02:21,640
working on a couple secret projects

56
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,663
that I can't tell you about,

57
00:02:23,663 --> 00:02:27,096
and just you know, a day
in the life of a CEO of

58
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:28,850
of a 800 person holding company.

59
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,246
Today, got some pure wow
stuff for the gallery

60
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:33,886
on the VaynerX world,
tons of VaynerMedia stuff,

61
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:35,658
just unlimited VaynerMedia stuff.

62
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:37,180
More about our capability of what partner

63
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,843
we bring in above the line.

64
00:02:38,843 --> 00:02:41,631
Make a quick phone call
to my dad and Brandon

65
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:44,850
about Wine Library stuff as
they go into their core season.

66
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,003
And also, the white label Harold

67
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:49,516
and the Robert Craig in the 'Con Valley,

68
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:51,516
I would go hard at that.

69
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:54,609
Just trying to up my game, a lotta,

70
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,588
a lot of engagement on Instagram lately.

71
00:02:56,588 --> 00:03:01,224
Babin's excited about all
these 100,000 like plus posts.

72
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:03,908
You guys look like the Beatles.

73
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:07,011
It's like the fuckin'
Beatles are walking by.

74
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:08,590
Anyway, gotta go.

75
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,499
Big meeting here in Houston,
that's what I'm here for.

76
00:03:10,499 --> 00:03:14,107
Babin's here. B-A-B-I-N on Instagram.

77
00:03:14,107 --> 00:03:17,375
Better than D-Rock,
slightly worse than Iris.

78
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,807
(laughing)

79
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:21,348
- How you doing Gary Vee?

80
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:22,364
- How are you doing man?

81
00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:23,197
- Michael.

82
00:03:23,197 --> 00:03:24,095
- Michael, with pleasure.

83
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:25,133
- Sorry to bother you but
I got a quick question.

84
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:26,425
- Now worries, sure go ahead.

85
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:27,283
You got it?

86
00:03:27,283 --> 00:03:28,545
- What's one good tip that you can give

87
00:03:28,545 --> 00:03:31,438
to a young entrepreneur that's
trying to grow his business?

88
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:32,726
As far as on the training side?

89
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:33,816
- On the training side?

90
00:03:33,816 --> 00:03:35,054
I think it's content man.

91
00:03:35,054 --> 00:03:35,958
You gotta get out there.

92
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,892
You gotta get people
here to know who you are

93
00:03:37,892 --> 00:03:39,330
so they ask for you.

94
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,614
I think Instagram is ridiculous.

95
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:44,140
Like how often are you
posting on Instagram?

96
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,973
Honestly.

97
00:03:44,973 --> 00:03:45,973
- Honestly, I try,

98
00:03:45,973 --> 00:03:48,941
of myself or just about knowledge
in general, information?

99
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:51,200
- Information or you
know, you looking good,

100
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,239
but posts on Instagram on
your Instagram account?

101
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,402
- At least two times a day.

102
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,801
- Good, I would go to four.

103
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:57,783
- Four times a day.

104
00:03:57,783 --> 00:04:00,301
Just content or just workout
videos and information?

105
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:02,777
- The more you give them,
you know, and listen,

106
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:05,299
a good shot of you
looking good is for them

107
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:07,732
but like more about
them than you about you.

108
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:08,565
- Okay.

109
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:10,281
- And then, you gotta be smart about it.

110
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:12,512
So for example, I'm about
to post this video about

111
00:04:12,512 --> 00:04:15,376
hashtags, like really
being smart about hashtags.

112
00:04:15,376 --> 00:04:18,190
Like when you post, you need to post,

113
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,305
the first comment needs
to have 20, 30 hashtags.

114
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:21,138
- I have that.

115
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:21,971
- Good.

116
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:23,400
- I have all my hashtags
already saved or whatever.

117
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,399
- Now the next thing.

118
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,232
You gotta go, you gotta search hashtags

119
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:29,014
like fitness, things of
that nature in your radius,

120
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:31,494
so within a 20 mile radius of this place.

121
00:04:31,494 --> 00:04:33,298
Let me show you.

122
00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:35,601
So like literally, you go into here

123
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:37,601
and you type in fitness,

124
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:41,196
right?

125
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:43,406
And you go into the tags,
right and you hit that.

126
00:04:43,406 --> 00:04:44,377
- Okay.

127
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:45,210
- Right?

128
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,156
- Right.

129
00:04:46,156 --> 00:04:49,645
- And now, you need to like
look at people's stuff,

130
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:53,379
really consume it and
then leave a comment like,

131
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:54,827
"Yo bro, that's doing it right."

132
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:55,660
- Got you.

133
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,617
- You need to become
part of the community,

134
00:04:57,617 --> 00:04:59,152
not just pushing out.

135
00:04:59,152 --> 00:04:59,985
- Got you.

136
00:04:59,985 --> 00:05:03,622
- If you go hard, four
times a day, shit for them.

137
00:05:03,622 --> 00:05:06,513
You go into 90 accounts
a day and leave your,

138
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:08,234
you know, that's you laying
in bed in the morning

139
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:10,452
or like fuckin', right
now, you're a little early,

140
00:05:10,452 --> 00:05:12,712
yeah, exactly, grab a
coffee or whatever you do

141
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,550
and like, you do that--

142
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,175
Honestly, as I've gotten my fitness up

143
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:17,537
in the last couple years,

144
00:05:17,537 --> 00:05:19,883
it's the same shit you know about fitness.

145
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:21,356
There's no shortcut.

146
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:22,988
There's no shortcut,

147
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:24,390
and there's no steroids in this.

148
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,005
You know, like, there's no shortcut.

149
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:29,196
It's just fuckin' everyday
eating, like you know,

150
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,255
some people are like, what's happening,

151
00:05:30,255 --> 00:05:32,498
you're not eating right or you're not,

152
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,666
I've all of a sudden finally figured out

153
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,800
how to use my lats so my
shoulders aren't hurting

154
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,643
and I'm finally starting
to build, you know?

155
00:05:38,643 --> 00:05:39,476
- I got you.

156
00:05:39,476 --> 00:05:40,746
- It's that.

157
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:41,648
Discipline.

158
00:05:41,648 --> 00:05:43,793
- Discipline, four times a
day, consistent, got you.

159
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:45,208
- Go into the community.

160
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,041
- Okay.

161
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:46,954
Appreciate it my man.

162
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:47,787
If I could get a quick photo with you--

163
00:05:47,787 --> 00:05:49,824
- Yeah, sure, of course.

164
00:05:49,824 --> 00:05:50,942
- I greatly appreciate it.

165
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:51,796
- Wish you well brother.

166
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:54,495
Take care, have a great holiday.

167
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:57,713
Here's, here's Justine and Mark Evans.

168
00:05:57,713 --> 00:05:59,088
They are now here.

169
00:05:59,088 --> 00:06:01,528
So now we are going to go and attack.

170
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,382
YouTube, YouTube,
YouTube, I love you guys.

171
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:05,422
Please subscribe if you haven't.

172
00:06:05,422 --> 00:06:06,631
Would mean the world to me

173
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:07,757
and I appreciate all your comments,

174
00:06:07,757 --> 00:06:09,440
read a bunch of them over Thanksgiving,

175
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,797
enjoyed the shit out of it.

176
00:06:10,797 --> 00:06:12,517
On my way to Equinox for a shower

177
00:06:12,517 --> 00:06:13,634
'cause that's how I do it.

178
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:14,551
Texans fan.

179
00:06:16,638 --> 00:06:17,702
And let's go.

180
00:06:17,702 --> 00:06:21,119
(upbeat electronic beat)

181
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:26,615
Vlog, this is a fairly uneventful vlog.

182
00:06:26,615 --> 00:06:28,534
Babin, we're gonna have to figure out

183
00:06:28,534 --> 00:06:31,815
some random shit right now, which we will.

184
00:06:31,815 --> 00:06:33,940
I'll come up with some
crazy rant, but first,

185
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,608
your favorite moment.

186
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:38,688
Vlog, one of the great
things about this vlog

187
00:06:38,688 --> 00:06:39,821
is the memes, right?

188
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:43,988
Like the fake or is it rivalry
between Babin and D-Rock.

189
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:49,016
But the best meme, no question,

190
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:51,941
is the incredible nature
of the greatest superhero

191
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:53,323
we've ever seen really.

192
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:56,563
I mean like, really, the
greatest, I mean listen,

193
00:06:56,563 --> 00:06:58,534
I'm a big fan of Batman.

194
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:02,701
Like I understand Spider-Man
and Superman and Thor's

195
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:08,590
intrigue and amazing abs and biceps

196
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,757
but has there ever been a
superhero more exciting for

197
00:07:13,887 --> 00:07:17,637
2018 entrepreneurs than the one and only,

198
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:22,815
one of the great, and I mean great

199
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:25,565
entrepreneurs of this generation,

200
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:29,828
hustle coming out of all parts of his body

201
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:32,245
and that's just how we do it.

202
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:34,189
- We made it baby.

203
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:36,480
- We made it baby, tell 'em.

204
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,685
- G5 mofuckin' airplane, big dick baby.

205
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:40,535
(laughing)

206
00:07:40,535 --> 00:07:41,368
- Pleasure man.

207
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:42,703
- Pleasure.

208
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:44,309
- Airport Gary.

209
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:46,949
Now you know why he's
such a great superhero.

210
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:50,025
'Cause he deals with content
of all kinds at all times

211
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:52,466
and never wavers baby.

212
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:53,549
Airport Gary.

213
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,738
(laughing)

214
00:07:57,738 --> 00:07:59,405
That was incredible.

215
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:04,975
Guys, knowing that this is gonna be,

216
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:08,794
a content thin episode,

217
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:11,472
think it's super important to

218
00:08:11,472 --> 00:08:13,831
bang out a little rant,
give you some value.

219
00:08:13,831 --> 00:08:16,481
One thing that might have
hit and missed your radar

220
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,234
that I wanna get in here,

221
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:20,619
I think a bunch of you saw it
but I'm seeing huge results.

222
00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:23,251
Some of the fastest
feedback I've ever seen

223
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:26,196
is around this $1.80 strategy.

224
00:08:26,196 --> 00:08:28,839
90 posts on Instagram
leaving your two cents

225
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:32,402
becoming part of the community
for growth and content,

226
00:08:32,402 --> 00:08:33,876
super fascinating.

227
00:08:33,876 --> 00:08:35,482
If you don't know what I'm talking about,

228
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,914
let's link down below Babin.

229
00:08:37,914 --> 00:08:41,727
I'm sure we've posted it on
Facebook and YouTube by now.

230
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,423
Your $1.80 strategy is incredible.

231
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,721
One of the biggest things
that so many of you've missed

232
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:49,056
is everybody talks about content, right.

233
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:50,966
What content, what content, what content.

234
00:08:50,966 --> 00:08:52,611
Nobody's talking about community.

235
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:54,866
You know, context of the content matters

236
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:55,699
but community.

237
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:56,690
The three C's right?

238
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,839
Like content of course,
we all talk about it.

239
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,693
Context, which is the thing that I think

240
00:09:00,693 --> 00:09:02,414
I've been teaching you which is what

241
00:09:02,414 --> 00:09:04,334
kind of creative and what platform.

242
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:05,986
But community, something I wrote in

243
00:09:05,986 --> 00:09:07,583
Thank You Economy in 2011,

244
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,624
is just like super duper, duper--

245
00:09:09,624 --> 00:09:10,457
- Gary Vee.

246
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:12,893
- Hey man, how are you?

247
00:09:12,893 --> 00:09:13,726
- Recording your video?

248
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:14,559
- Yeah you're in it now.

249
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,443
You're in it bro.

250
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:17,028
You're in it.

251
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:17,861
Community.

252
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:20,087
Community really, really,
really, really matters

253
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:23,164
and this $1.80 strategy
is one of the more unique,

254
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:25,068
clever ways that I've come up with it.

255
00:09:25,068 --> 00:09:26,777
Have you seen it yet Babin?

256
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:27,709
I'm pumped about it.

257
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:28,542
Check it.

258
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:30,043
Double down on the $1.80.

259
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:31,282
Shit, go $3.60.

260
00:09:31,282 --> 00:09:33,669
While this is gonna be a
funnier kind of episode,

261
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:35,421
let's settle once and for all.

262
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:37,924
You know, Babin, D-Rock, Kyle,

263
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:40,818
Justin, Iris, right?

264
00:09:40,818 --> 00:09:43,581
Those are the five that
have really done it?

265
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:45,795
Why don't you edit up a scene,

266
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:49,118
two scenes that are six seconds each,

267
00:09:49,118 --> 00:09:52,715
so that's 12 times five,
sixty seconds, two scenes,

268
00:09:52,715 --> 00:09:56,646
now you gotta be fair 'cause
it's you, Babin, in it,

269
00:09:56,646 --> 00:10:00,114
so have you have to be fair or don't.

270
00:10:00,114 --> 00:10:02,787
Two scenes, six seconds
each, from all five

271
00:10:02,787 --> 00:10:04,117
and in the comment section,

272
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:07,292
vote for you favorite production editor,

273
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:12,217
predator, producer, director, of DailyVee.

274
00:10:12,217 --> 00:10:13,948
- You just started the World War 3.

275
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:16,185
- I mean look, D-Rock has
a disproportion advantage

276
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:17,975
for being around for a long time.

277
00:10:17,975 --> 00:10:21,444
You have this whole kind of
like, underbelly cult following,

278
00:10:21,444 --> 00:10:24,227
Iris has won over a lot of
hearts, she's really skilled.

279
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:26,540
Justin disadvantage for being around,

280
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,181
being gone for a little while.

281
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:29,514
Hi, how are you?

282
00:10:30,556 --> 00:10:31,793
My

283
00:10:31,793 --> 00:10:33,857
leave that there,

284
00:10:33,857 --> 00:10:34,984
I couldn't print my ticket

285
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:36,331
'cause there was some adjustments,

286
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:39,801
Justin disadvantaged it
for being away for so long

287
00:10:39,801 --> 00:10:41,991
and Kyle's new but has a crazy mustache.

288
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:43,323
Chop it up.

289
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:44,656
Give us answers.

290
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:47,402
So it's early Monday morning,

291
00:10:47,402 --> 00:10:50,275
and I've been wanting to
make a Monday morning video

292
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,860
for a long time and finally
D-Rock, we're doing it.

293
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,683
So real quick, this is just a rant.

294
00:10:55,683 --> 00:10:57,166
(hip-hop music)

295
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,097
Congrats, you're in fuckin' debt.

296
00:10:59,097 --> 00:10:59,930
(laughing)

297
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,323
You need to be more better
Homes and Garden and less QVC.

298
00:11:04,323 --> 00:11:05,156
Got it?

299
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:05,989
- Thank you so much.

300
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:07,950
You're welcome, take care.

301
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,045
- Gary, love your wine show.

302
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:10,089
- Thank you so much man.

303
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:10,922
I appreciate that.

304
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:11,823
How are you?

305
00:11:11,823 --> 00:11:12,656
- Nice to meet you.

306
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:13,489
- Nice to meet you man.

307
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:15,184
Babin here is all bent out of shape.

308
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:16,742
He just said today is rough.

309
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,043
To be very frank with you VaynerNation,

310
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:18,926
I don't give a f--

311
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:21,434
Alright, big night for
D-Rock, Babin fucked up.

312
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:23,437
New K-Swiss sneakers and Babin literally

313
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:25,568
forgot the sneakers at the office.

314
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:27,045
This morning, I don't
know if we caught it Iris,

315
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:30,275
I don't think so, I told Tyler like

316
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:34,163
bringing the fuckin' sneakers to the shoot

317
00:11:34,163 --> 00:11:36,771
for the shoot of the fuckin' sneakers.

318
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:38,120
Babin.

319
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,150
- He told me and I--

320
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,450
- It would been good if you figured it out

321
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,513
19 minutes ago instead of--

322
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:44,440
And I mean that, it's like
I think the real reason

323
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,398
I give away my content for free,

324
00:11:46,398 --> 00:11:49,247
I engage with all of you,
I answer, I give love,

325
00:11:49,247 --> 00:11:51,315
I think the biggest reason I do that

326
00:11:51,315 --> 00:11:54,722
is 'cause I don't need your help or money

327
00:11:54,722 --> 00:11:56,584
to accomplish my goals.

328
00:11:56,584 --> 00:11:57,945
I think it's the ultimate leverage

329
00:11:57,945 --> 00:11:59,870
to be able to give more
and always give more

330
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,097
and always give more.

331
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:04,425
And learn how to take, not at the expense

332
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:05,837
of the people you're giving--

333
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:07,925
And I'm starting to find a little clarity.

334
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:10,879
Starting to understand
why this thing is so hard.

335
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,748
This game of entrepreneurship.

336
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:14,820
Shit, this game of life.

337
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,888
It's because the real
answer is really found

338
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:22,094
when you're pulling from
opposite directions.

339
00:12:22,094 --> 00:12:23,908
Sitting here laying and saying, why?

340
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:26,091
Why, why am I so blessed?

341
00:12:26,091 --> 00:12:28,423
Why is all this good stuff happening?

342
00:12:28,423 --> 00:12:30,647
And it's because I'm a contradiction.

343
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:34,551
You know, I knew that what
I was doing in business,

344
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:35,986
what I was doing in friendship,

345
00:12:35,986 --> 00:12:36,849
what I was doing in parenting,

346
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:38,709
like that was all on point.

347
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:39,958
But in the back of my mind,

348
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,775
I knew that my health wasn't there right?

349
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:44,753
But the way I was rolling,

350
00:12:44,753 --> 00:12:46,661
I should've looked a thousand times worse

351
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:48,266
than I looked back then, right?

352
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:51,465
Like, my weight and just my body structure

353
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:54,880
and my natural DNA kept it in check enough

354
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,576
that I wasn't 400 pounds because

355
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,576
there was no good eating habits,

356
00:12:58,576 --> 00:13:00,986
there was zero, I mean basically,

357
00:13:00,986 --> 00:13:02,639
there was zero exercising,

358
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,136
zero until the time I was 38
and a half when I did this

359
00:13:05,136 --> 00:13:07,976
so it's on the back of my
mind since I turned 30.

00:13:07,976 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat electronic beat)
