1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,835
- On this episode, 
this talent stops by.

2
00:00:07,947 --> 00:00:10,542
(hip hop music)

3
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,250
- [Gary] You have questions

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,959
and I will answer them.

5
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:29,917
This is The #AskGaryVee Show.

6
00:00:33,542 --> 00:00:35,959
- Hey everybody, this
is Gary Vay-ner-chuk

7
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:40,667
and this is episode 246
of The #AskGaryVee Show.

8
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:43,708
We are in the studio with one of

9
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:46,375
our entire
crew's favorite artists,

10
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,917
one of the favorite artists
of the entire music generation

11
00:00:48,917 --> 00:00:51,208
that's living in the
music world right now, Logic.

12
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:52,667
- Swag, sup dawg?

13
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:55,417
- I'm so happy to be here, man,
thank you for the hospitality.

14
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:56,500
We're gonna
answer some questions.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,417
- The energy.

16
00:00:57,417 --> 00:00:58,875
- Energy's legit.
- Energy's legit.

17
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,708
- I'm happy as fuck.
- Yeah, this is tight.

18
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:01,875
- Okay, good. 
- Life is great.

19
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,166
- Life is great.
- Life is great.

20
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,542
- Do you know how rare
it is to be a human being?

21
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:06,291
- Yeah.

22
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:08,667
Four hundred trillion to one.
- V rare.

23
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:12,417
You're more likely to do the
NCAA tournament perfectly

24
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:16,291
on your bracket 11 times in
your life than being born.

25
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,792
- That's crazy, well
I'm glad I'm here, then.

26
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:22,291
- (laughs) Logic, for the 13
people that don't know,

27
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,166
because you've absolutely
exploded, it's been fun

28
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:27,208
to watch from afar, gotten
to know your team really well

29
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,667
over the last
month or so, it's just

30
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:32,500
a really impressive rise
not only on the talent side

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,875
of what you do musically,
but how you guys have been so

32
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,583
thoughtful, how you
actually give a crap

33
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:39,208
about your audience,
who you are as a dude,

34
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,208
and the team that you
surround yourself with.

35
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,750
Why don't you give the Vayner
Nation as I like to call them,

36
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,792
my homies, a little
bit of 411, who are you?

37
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:49,875
- Yeah, my name
is Logic, you know?

38
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,792
Born Sir Robert Bryson
Hall the Second in 1990,

39
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:55,917
I'm biracial to a black
father and a white mother

40
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:58,667
and I grew up in
Gaithersburg, Maryland.

41
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm very proud of where I'm
from, and it was crazy, man.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,083
In my household,
I was the only child between

43
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:06,583
my mother and father, but my
household was predominantly

44
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,333
black, all my brothers
and sisters were black.

45
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,375
Seven brothers
and sisters, you know.

46
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:14,542
It's crazy, brother's selling
crack and me having to rise

47
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:17,333
out of that. My father abusing
drugs. My mother using drugs

48
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,792
and abusing alcohol,
making my way out of that.

49
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,750
When I was 17 years
old I left the house,

50
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,333
I got two jobs, worked in
the morning and the evening,

51
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,333
and I would come home
every single night and record

52
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,542
and record and record, because
I told myself I was going

53
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:33,750
to do it, and long story short,
I fucking made it to this,

54
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,166
we're in my house,
if you can believe it.

55
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,667
I can't believe it's
happened, so fucking dab.

56
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:41,375
(group laughter)

57
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,500
- Honestly, before
we get into the questions

58
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,959
we need to take a step back.

59
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,417
In such a tough environment,
was there anybody in your life,

60
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:52,041
whether a teacher or
grandparent or random neighbor,

61
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:55,041
or was it very
internal that made you look

62
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,959
at your surroundings and speak
to yourself in your own dome

63
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,667
and say "I'm gonna get
out of this and this is how

64
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,583
"I'm gonna do it?"
And in parallel,

65
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:02,417
'cause I'm getting excited now

66
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:04,500
'cause I love these
stories, when did you realize

67
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,625
you had the talent to
potentially be able to pull off

68
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,708
this ridiculousness?

69
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,208
- No, I don't think 
it was the talent.

70
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,166
First and foremost,
I think it was the mentality

71
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:14,166
of looking at music and life
in general as a business.

72
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,166
So where a lot of
people look at chains and money

73
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,041
and bitches and all
this shit, like legitimately,

74
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:22,750
it's like "God I want that",
I saw past all that

75
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,291
and I saw the greats setting
up companies and investing

76
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,000
and all that and I said to
myself, "I want that.

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,333
"I want to be able
to support a family."

78
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,125
I never really had a family,
you know, so that's something

79
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:38,834
I wanted, and I think when
it comes to talent and stuff,

80
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:41,542
yeah, I don't know,
it's something fun.

81
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:45,000
I said, "What do I love,
and what do I love the most

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,083
"that I can hopefully do for the
rest of my life as a career?"

83
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:51,375
And then I looked at it
from a business standpoint.

84
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,166
Not just an artistic --
- When?

85
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,625
- As a kid.
- Nine?

86
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,333
- No, I was 17, it was like
when I realized oh my God --

87
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:00,959
- Did you rap outside,
or battle rap, or play rap?

88
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,834
- Yeah I was such an
introvert at the same time,

89
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:06,500
because everyone else
was out drinking and smoking

90
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,667
and this and that, and
I wasn't really about that,

91
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:11,917
and hip hop has
always been kinda known...

92
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:13,166
- For those things.

93
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,000
- Yeah but there's also
at times, like going out

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,083
into the world, it's just
a violent place.

95
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,750
So that's another thing,

96
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,250
I just always kept to myself,
even now. You know what I mean?

97
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,375
When I go out and
people recognize me,

98
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:28,291
I'll be in my zone and I go
places and make sure I'm secure

99
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,417
and everything's good, but
I'll go somewhere and somebody

100
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:33,500
will start crying
behind the cash register,

101
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,625
as I'm ordering a McDouble
or some shit and I'm like,

102
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,875
"Oh, that's right."

103
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,250
- This is my life now.
- I forgot.

104
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, you know and it's so cool.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,959
- Do you love taking selfies?

106
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,667
- Yeah totally, I love
anything that has to do

107
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,792
with fans and interaction
because they're who made me.

108
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:50,000
But it's not the bullshit
of, "Yeah, they made me",

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,417
like don't give a shit. We were
talking about it earlier,

110
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:56,250
last year before my album
was out, the most important

111
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,333
album I ever did, The Incredible
True Story At The Time,

112
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,667
I literally paid for a tour bus

113
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,250
and spent over six figures to

114
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,542
start in Los Angeles, California
and end in New York,

115
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:08,417
traveling across
the United States.

116
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:10,542
Going to fans' houses, 
surprising them,

117
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:13,166
playing my album
before it came out,

118
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,708
sharing meals with them,
spending time with them.

119
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,875
And it was incredible,
and that really let me know,

120
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,458
this is why I make music.

121
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:23,208
All the bullshit, or the
write-ups, or the accolades,

122
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,208
that's great, but fuck that.

123
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,667
- It's a by-product.

124
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,166
- I can't even believe
that I can affect someone,

125
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,834
where they're like,
"Yo, you saved my life."

126
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:34,667
- When was the first
time you tasted success?

127
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,083
Like, did you put out
a song on the internet?

128
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,375
- Alright, I'm gonna be honest.

129
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,250
- Please.
- The first time --

130
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,417
- That would be great.

131
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:42,542
- The first time
I really looked in,

132
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,291
it wasn't even looking in
a mirror, I looked around,

133
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:48,667
is when I got a check
for a million dollars.

134
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:49,792
- You lost your mind, right?

135
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:51,375
- No, I didn't lose
my mind, I was like,

136
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,250
I'd already had a few
million dollars in my account,

137
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,625
but when I looked at one
check that was for a million

138
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,250
dollars, I was
like, "Oh God damn."

139
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,291
(Gary laughs)

140
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,792
Yeah, I was like
this is really crazy.

141
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:05,875
- But before that insanity,
because that's insanity,--

142
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:06,708
- Yeah.

143
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,583
and 99.9% of people
will never feel that.

144
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:09,834
- Everything else was failing.

145
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:12,000
Everything to me was
like, okay, you know,

146
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,208
such and such
amount of money for a show,

147
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,041
it was like okay, yeah, but
there's always gonna be more.

148
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,333
I never put myself out
where I'm like, "How poppin'

149
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,458
"is Logic, how good am I?
How this, how that?"

150
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,667
I never really thought about it.
I always put it away,

151
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:28,750
even sitting here and talking
to you, as an entrepreneur,

152
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,834
you're so successful,
but even this, I was like

153
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:33,542
let me not read
too much into it.

154
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:35,291
I'm just gonna sit
down with this dude.

155
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,291
I don't like to hype shit,
so I know what you're saying.

156
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,750
I could be like,
"When I signed to Def Jam,

157
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,375
"when I got that check",
but it's like --

158
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,291
- What about the first
time somebody rolled up on you

159
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:50,083
and really brought a verse
that you put out to the world

160
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,542
to you?
- In what sense?

161
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,959
- As you put out
early music, early, early.

162
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,917
Not like recently, early.

163
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,875
Like somebody just
rolling up at you at McDonald's,

164
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,792
before people cried at
McDonald's, did somebody roll up

165
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:06,250
on you and regurgitate one
of your hooks or your lyrics?

166
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,625
I think that's where it
gets interesting, right?

167
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:11,625
- I was back in College Park
in Maryland, this was before

168
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,583
the Young Sinatra mixtape came
out. And the Young Sinatra's

169
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,166
mixtape was the one
that started the foundation,

170
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:20,375
and somebody was
driving down the street.

171
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,291
- And you heard him playing it?

172
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,250
- I heard him
playing one of my songs.

173
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,625
And I'm like
shooting a music video,

174
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,166
I was in the middle of
shooting a music video.

175
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,500
That to me was why,
it was probably 2010.

176
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,750
I couldn't, that--

177
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,458
- That's what I mean, right?
- yeah, that was it.

178
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,625
- Back in those days,

179
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,667
that's where it
gets interesting.

180
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:35,667
- Yeah, but that,
that's 'cause like,

181
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,125
every little
thing was so amazing,

182
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,500
'cause I mean, when it
really started, I was like,

183
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,792
"Yo, I'm gonna really,
really do this.

184
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,959
I was 19 and I was homeless

185
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,125
and I, I didn't
have a place to stay

186
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,542
and it was Christmas time

187
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:49,208
and my homey,
Lennie, who you met upstairs,

188
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,000
- Yeah.

189
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,083
- Big Lenbo,
who's an amazing rapper,

190
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:55,291
let me live with him and
sleep on his couch for a year.

191
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,333
And, and he was like,
"Yo, like you have a year,

192
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,208
"blah, blah, blah,"

193
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,291
I was supposed to get a job

194
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,208
and things were going so well.

195
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,834
Every week, it seemed
like there was something new

196
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:03,208
and something amazing and, and,

197
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,750
and he was a land
surveyor for 12 years,

198
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,667
so he would like survey areas,
- Hm-mm.

199
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,625
- Before, you know,
things would get built,

200
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,291
and houses and
buildings and whatever.

201
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,000
And almost a year to the day,

202
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,792
he took care of me,
he fed me, he clothed me,

203
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:17,583
he let me sleep on his couch

204
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,208
and almost a year to the
day, I signed with Def Jam,

205
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,333
told him to quit
his job of 12 years

206
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,667
and we moved to L.A.

207
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,583
- I love it, man, I love it.
- Yeah, crazy.

208
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,041
- Listen, for
everybody in my audience,

209
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,333
I'm really excited to be here

210
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,333
and you'll understand why,

211
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,417
because the path of the talent

212
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:34,207
and finding out what you love

213
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:36,125
and then building around it,
you guys know my spiel,

214
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,917
Crush It!,
that's a long time ago.

215
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,832
It's the execution of the way--

216
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:41,581
- Lexecution, I'm just kidding.

217
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:44,583
- Yeah, the
execution and the way that

218
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,000
these guys put out,
when I say these guys,

219
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,875
Logic and his team
think about putting out music,

220
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,166
how they engage with fans,

221
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:54,083
it's the modern
attention graph story.

222
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,500
I haven't come
across a lot of people

223
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,667
that I think have
totally grasped it

224
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,917
in the way that
you and your team have

225
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:01,000
and you've got
a great team here.

226
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,041
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

227
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,083
- And I just, it's fun for me,

228
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,917
because I know how this ends up

229
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:07,417
and to be very frank,
I'll put, I'm gonna put it

230
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:09,083
on the record,
'cause it's fun for me.

231
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,750
I know this ends
up with you being

232
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,166
one of the biggest
talents in your game.

233
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,125
- Shit, hope so.

234
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:14,875
- And so like,
it's fun for me to

235
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,166
look at this video in four years

236
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,000
- Nice.

237
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,208
- and tell my kids,
"Like, I told you."

238
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,250
- That's pretty gangster.

239
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,542
- That's pretty
much what I'm doing here.

240
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:21,375
- That's dope.
- I'm selfish.

241
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,208
- No, but that's real.
(laughs)

242
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,875
'cause I always believe in
speaking things into existence.

243
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,291
In 2010, I did
some random interview

244
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,708
and nobody, I didn't
have a fan in the world,

245
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:29,959
and I was like
I'm gonna be a X--

246
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,500
- HipHopAtLunch.com, or--

247
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,542
- Yeah, something like that.

248
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:34,792
In 2013, and I named the date,
I said in 2013

249
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:36,542
I'm gonna be a XXL Freshman

250
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:37,542
and I was, you know, it's like,

251
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:39,792
so just saying
these things, you know,

252
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,041
to cover that
magazine was incredible.

253
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,792
Or to say I'm
gonna release an album,

254
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:44,959
I'm gonna do such and such
in my first week, you know.

255
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,291
- Is there any
artists you wanna collab with?

256
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:47,917
I was curious about that.

257
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,333
- Actually there's like--
- I know you haven't,

258
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,166
that's why I'm asking.

259
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,125
- Yeah, no, rap is cool,

260
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,458
but I don't know, I'm
just like, rap is dope,

261
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,375
but I just like, I like...

262
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,041
- What like Blake Shelton
or something? (laughs)

263
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,166
- Nah, I just like indie rock, 
you know what I mean?

264
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,375
And like
different shit like that.

265
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,917
I like this dude named Destroyer

266
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:04,750
and I like, love
Adele, I just love the...

267
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,083
I don't know, it's like
rap is so cool and it's fun

268
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,708
and it's just what I
happen to be good at,

269
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,542
but if I could I would like,
pick up a guitar and like sing

270
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:13,792
to the world.
(Gary lughs)

271
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,000
But I don't have that
talent, so I'm just like,

272
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
giving you what I got.

273
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,125
- Listen,
- You know.

274
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,166
- What you've got is plenty.

275
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,792
Boyd, we got
phone numbers coming?

276
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:20,583
Everybody on Instagram Live,

277
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,875
start putting up
your phone numbers,

278
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:22,375
- Yeah,

279
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,333
- We're gonna
call the first person.

280
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:23,875
- Straight up.

281
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,208
- Ah, you got this?

282
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,291
Alright, so as they're
pulling up the first call,

283
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,917
you can just put it, you can
call it and put in on speaker

284
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:30,667
and we'll have
the first questions.

285
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:31,667
- You're going too fast.

286
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:33,750
- Yeah, it's going fast,
but they're big boys.

287
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,625
Those are two big boys
right there, they got it.

288
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,500
You good, Boyd?

289
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,667
- [Boyd] Yeah.
- Okay, good.

290
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:38,959
While they're doing their thing,

291
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,750
'cause we don't
have the big, like...

292
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,458
speaker phone here right now,

293
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:46,333
tell me, when you talk
about all those other songs

294
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,917
and genres, how much
other music do you listen to?

295
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:50,917
Daily?

296
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,875
- Oh yeah, I listen to
different music every day.

297
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,208
I don't really listen to rap,

298
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,875
especially now, just
like, ever since my last album,

299
00:10:56,875 --> 00:11:00,375
and mix tape, I just,
like I'm so detached from rap.

300
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,208
- Why?

301
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,333
- But not to, yeah, not to where

302
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,583
I don't know what's going on,

303
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,166
I love to know what's
going on with artists,

304
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,875
that I really
appreciate, you know.

305
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,792
I love Cole and
Kendrick and Drake and,

306
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:11,041
but even, you know,
classic and Nas

307
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,500
and like all types
of dope shit like that.

308
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,750
- Do you have any time to
look at the kids coming up?

309
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,583
Or you just like two--

310
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,708
- Oh, of course, but
that's like, that's like

311
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:17,917
just ear to the
streets, you know,

312
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:18,750
like you always--

313
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,583
- Yeah, how
important is that to you?

314
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,750
- I think that's a,
that's a big thing,

315
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,834
because it's like
you wanna know,--

316
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:23,458
- You got it?

317
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,291
- you wanna
know what's relevant,

318
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,208
you wanna know what's going on,

319
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,875
so that you're able to
stay with yourself--

320
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,583
- Connect and understand?
- You know what I mean?

321
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,417
You wanna vibe
with somebody else,

322
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:31,458
so somebody who
might be coming up,

323
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,250
who's like a
super dope lyricist,

324
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,083
or whatever the case may be
and you wanna go from there.

325
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,333
- What's going on here?

326
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,166
- Is it going?

327
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,417
- It's about to go, I hope.

328
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:39,375
- Is it going?

329
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,041
- It says that it's calling.
(phone ringing)

330
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:41,834
Here we go.
- Snap.

331
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:46,291
- Somebody's about
to be real happy.

332
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,375
(phone ringing)

333
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,625
- [Ryan] Hey, Ryan speaking.

334
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,959
- Ryan, this is GaryVee

335
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,125
and you're on
The #AskGaryVee Show with Logic.

336
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,417
- [Ryan] (laughs) Hey, Gary.
What's up, man?

337
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,792
- Life is good, man.

338
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:01,834
What kinda
question you got for us?

339
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:05,458
- [Ryan] Well, I just
wanna know how many hours

340
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,834
you are currently working and
trying to balance family life.

341
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:12,708
- Are you struggling with
your work-life balance?

342
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,792
- [Ryan] No, I think
I need to work more.

343
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:15,917
- Respect, okay.

344
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:17,750
Logic, I'm gonna throw
this at you first, right?

345
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,000
You're a happily
married man now.

346
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,834
- Yeah.
- Right?

347
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:21,500
- Totally.
- How long?

348
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,417
- It's been a year and a half.

349
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:23,834
- Alright, so you're
newly wed, right?

350
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:24,417
- Yeah, yeah.

351
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:25,917
- How long were you guys
together before you got married?

352
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:26,834
- We were
together for two years.

353
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:27,625
- Got it.

354
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,542
Do you struggle with,
I mean, obviously you've got

355
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,291
your workspace
here at your home.

356
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,750
Do you think
about work-life balance?

357
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,708
Do you think about,
'cause you're grinding,

358
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,750
you're in this incredible
moment in your career.

359
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,458
Do you worry about
finding the right balance?

360
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,291
Do you feel good
about your balance?

361
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,250
Where you at today?

362
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,875
- It's something that
it's always never-ending.

363
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,333
So for me, for
example, last year,

364
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,041
I performed over
130 shows, I performed.

365
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,750
I was gone like 90% of the year.
- You were gone the whole year.

366
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,500
- Exactly, so it's nice to know,
you really do need balance.

367
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,917
- Was she able
to travel with you?

368
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:57,333
- Yeah, she was
able to travel, but then,

369
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,500
she's her own person too.

370
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,333
- Yeah, she's got a life.

371
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,208
- So we were able to see each
other and things like that.

372
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,708
So I think sure,
work as hard as you can,

373
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,417
but when it affects
the person you love,

374
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,875
in truly any
type of negative way,

375
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,041
that's when you just
need to sit down and say,

376
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,166
"Alright, how are
we gonna do this?"

377
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,458
And you guys schedule it
out together and you say,

378
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,625
"These days are ours,
or this dinner is ours,

379
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,708
"and these three
hours on Sunday is ours.

380
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,583
"And this is mine,
and that's yours,

381
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,458
"and this is us together,
and this is work."

382
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,583
- Ryan, I think
Logic's got it right.

383
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,959
It comes down to
communication, right?

384
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:28,375
And the truth is,
some weeks, some months,

385
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,792
some years, it goes perfect,

386
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:32,333
and other times it's
a real struggle, right?

387
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,041
And so for me,

388
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,875
I've got the greatest
support system of all time.

389
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,000
My wife, Lizzie, is
absolutely the foundation

390
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,875
of my insanity.

391
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:43,125
I also travel a shitload,
and I've got two young kids.

392
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,333
But you've also gotta
look at circumstances, right?

393
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,458
So much of, I don't
know if you caught this part,

394
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,917
but so much of what makes Logic

395
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:51,792
is the scenario of
the house he grew up in.

396
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:54,083
I grew up in an immigrant
household where my dad

397
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,750
left before I woke up and got
home after I went to sleep.

398
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,917
My dad and I slept
in the same exact place

399
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,875
for the first 17
years of my life.

400
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,083
This is true, by the way.

401
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,250
I never went to sleep-away camp.

402
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,125
We basically, outside of a
couple sleepovers that I had,

403
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,583
slept in the same home every
night and I barely saw him.

404
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:14,500
And my wife also had a
ridiculously successful father,

405
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,375
different,
corporate America success,

406
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,500
not immigrant entrepreneur
success, so he traveled a lot.

407
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,250
So for her and I, it's
not foreign that I'm away

408
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,834
and traveling 50,
100, 150 days a year.

409
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:28,583
Whereas other people, if you
ate dinner with mom and dad

410
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:32,208
every night, and
your dad was home at 5:30,

411
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,333
and then you go marry
somebody who's traveling

412
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,959
180 days a week, that's foreign.

413
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,250
So you've gotta communicate,
you've gotta understand

414
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,417
the context of where
everybody comes from.

415
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:42,083
When I hear you say you
think you gotta work more,

416
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,250
that's a whole
different question.

417
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,667
That's not about
work-life balance.

418
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,708
That is, are you doing
the thing you wanna do?

419
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,458
Are you hungry?

420
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,208
- Personal happiness.

421
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,917
- Yeah, exactly, I mean,
personal happiness

422
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:52,166
is really fascinating
because the truth is, Ryan,

423
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,333
the biggest that, if
you're watching me,

424
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,667
the one thing I'm scared of is

425
00:14:57,667 --> 00:15:00,375
not everybody has to buy
the New York Jets, right?

426
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,708
I'm trying to buy
the Jets, and I mean it.

427
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,625
So I am gonna
bleed out of my eyeballs

428
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,041
for the rest of my life.

429
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,708
But not everybody has to do
that, so I think it's imperative

430
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,375
that you figure out,
you don't necessarily have

431
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,792
to work more, unless
you wanna achieve a lot more

432
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:17,834
and wanna be happier
with what you're doing

433
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,000
day in and day out.

434
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,583
- [Ryan] Yeah, I just
realized I'm so passionate

435
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,917
about Treehouse, I'm just
gonna get up earlier now.

436
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:27,834
So I get up at 4:30 and
just grind, and I love it.

437
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:28,625
It's good.

438
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,333
- That's awesome, man.

439
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,250
Well, listen,
keep doing your thing.

440
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,959
Thanks for watching the show.

441
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:32,750
- [Ryan] Love you, man.

442
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,500
- And go listen to
Logic's music, if you haven't,

443
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,792
'cause I feel like you haven't
and you need to immediately.

444
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:40,041
- [Ryan] Will do.
- You promise?

445
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,208
- [Ryan] I promise.

446
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,208
- Do you promise Logic right
now, he's literally here,

447
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,250
you have to promise him.

448
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,917
- I promise you, just
say, "I promise you, Logic."

449
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:48,959
- [Ryan] Logic, I promise you,
I'm driving home,

450
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:49,917
I'm gonna listen right now.

451
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:52,041
- Spotify right now, bro,
L-O-G-I-C.

452
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,208
It's not spelled ghetto.

453
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,166
(group laughter)

454
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,375
- Ryan, seriously,
you're gonna think back

455
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,125
to this moment in three
years when Logic's literally

456
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,250
one of the five
biggest musicians in the world

457
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,917
and think that was the craziest
shit that ever happened.

458
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:04,291
- [Ryan] (laughs) I can't wait.

459
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,291
- Alright man, take care,
buh-bye.

460
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,041
Alright, you guys, do
you have it on your thing?

461
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:08,959
- What a nice guy.

462
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,875
- Great guy, listen
that's the one thing,

463
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,041
and I think, you know what, and
I've looked at a lot of your

464
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,834
fan base--
- Yeah.

465
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:16,333
- As I was starting
to really dig the last week.

466
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,041
I think you and I have a
very similar thing which is

467
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:21,417
a funny thing happens when
you put good into the world.

468
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:23,333
- Oh dude,
positivity is everything.

469
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,083
- Like our fans
struggle to be negative

470
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,708
'cause they know that
we won't like that.

471
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,583
- Yeah, that's so insane.

472
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,166
- So, that's the punchline.

473
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,875
- I never understand
that though and I, you know

474
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,458
here's one thing so like, so
since my motto, my whole motto

475
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,792
is peace, love and positivity.

476
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:37,750
- Peace, love and positivity.

477
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,333
- That's it.

478
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,500
That's my whole
motto and some people

479
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,291
like hate me.

480
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,667
They're like fuck you, war, hate

481
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,583
and negativity.
They'll say disgusting things,

482
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,291
hurtful things but
that's just the internet.

483
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,125
And I used to always--

484
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,166
- It's not just the internet,
it's just people.

485
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,208
- Yeah, it's just people.
- And listen, if they're

486
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,250
broken inside,--

487
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:49,875
- Oh yeah.

488
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,333
- they're trying to drag
people down with them.

489
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,000
- And I used to wonder,
I would ask myself,

490
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,625
I would say, "Why do people
hate? I don't understand it.

491
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,750
"I don't understand how, why
would somebody hate on me?

492
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,083
"Why would somebody hate?"

493
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,041
And then, it clicked and I said,
I will never understand

494
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,500
because I'm not a hater.

495
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,542
I don't have a hater mentality.

496
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,540
I have a winner mentality.
A lover's mentality,

497
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,374
you know what I mean?
- I get it.

498
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,040
- So, it's just like
with law of attraction

499
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,790
or whatever you wanna call it.
Like I don't, I don't use...

500
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,039
You know a lot of people say,
"Oh, you know, I wish

501
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,665
"I could travel the world
or I wish I could do this

502
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:16,082
"with my life but..."

503
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,790
and as soon as they say but
that's it, they destroyed it,

504
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,039
it's over.
- 100%

505
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,250
- If you say
but that's bullshit,

506
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,208
you have to say,
"I'm gonna, I will,"you know?

507
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,790
or before, you know what I mean?

508
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,540
- And, listen, but people front

509
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,082
and peacock all the time.
- Yeah, of course.

510
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,000
- Like, you've
gotta put in the work.

511
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,041
- Yeah, 100%.

512
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,375
(Gary stammering)

513
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,542
- You've got talent and
all this but like again,

514
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:35,166
reverse engineering your track.

515
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,583
Like, you fucking worked.

516
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,000
- Worked hard.
Definitely.

517
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,917
- And you're not gonna stop.
- No, for sure.

518
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:40,875
- And that's that.
- Yep.

519
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,750
- I worked every,
like people,

520
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,208
I remember when
I started really blowing up

521
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,125
and people would
hit me up and say,

522
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,041
"Gary, I went to
high school with you.

523
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,417
"You got so lucky,
I'm so pumped for you."

524
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:50,291
- Lucky?

525
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,583
- And I would reply
and I would be like

526
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,000
"Yo bro, I'm not lucky."

527
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,458
"Remember when you
went to the Jersey Shore

528
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,375
"and banged chicks?
I worked."

529
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,708
- Yeah, I was grinding.
- "I worked"

530
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,500
- That's how I feel,
the same way.

531
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,208
- Because you worked.
Everybody who worked.

532
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,875
- I feel like in
many ways, I missed out,

533
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,125
and I don't wanna
use the word missed out

534
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,125
but I'm saying like, you know,
while other guys were like

535
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,417
going to parties,
and enjoying themselves

536
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:10,333
and doing all this
other stuff, it's like,

537
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,708
I thought man,
that could be cool.

538
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,333
I was never that
person anyway but I was like

539
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,917
man, if I had that
ambition and wanna go have fun.

540
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:18,959
Man, that could be so fun

541
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:21,208
but now I look back like,
I would rather be here

542
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,667
any day of the week
than that was my glory day

543
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,166
and I'm fucking
working at J Crew still.

544
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,583
- I mean, you're married
now and in a different place

545
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,458
but like if people understood
the leverage that comes along

546
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:34,250
with the success and all the
things that they think they

547
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,208
want by taking shortcuts,
they can get in spades.

548
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,542
- Yeah, that's real.
It's 100%.

549
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:41,792
- Got one?
Let's do it.

550
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:44,125
Yeah, I mean, you know.

551
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:49,125
(phone ringing
and goes to voicemail)

552
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,125
- Oh, yep, that's it.

553
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,166
The kid's gonna be
devastated forever.

554
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:52,959
- Damn.

555
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:56,708
- So, as they're
pulling up the next number...

556
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:57,667
- That's how you know it's real.

557
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,375
- What other interests
do you have outside

558
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,041
the music world?
- Oh, I wanna act.

559
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,458
I wanna act and I wanna invest

560
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,625
but before I invest I
have a number in my mind

561
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,875
that I want in my
personal account, after taxes,

562
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,792
after everything,
just sitting in my account.

563
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:10,000
- And then you'll
go on the offense?

564
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,875
- Yeah and then
that way it's like okay.

565
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,917
- You can afford
to play and learn.

566
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,542
- Exactly, exactly.

567
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:16,500
- And learn because
you know you're gonna

568
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,333
lose some dollars--
- Yep.

569
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,458
- but you'll learn--
- Yeah.

570
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,083
- I understand.

571
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,083
- It's all education
process so it's like

572
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,708
totes magotes.

573
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,792
- Magotes.
(DRock laughs)

574
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:28,542
(telephone rings)

575
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,542
- [Ryan] Hello?

576
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:30,625
- This is GaryVee

577
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,917
and you're on
The #AskGaryVee Show with Logic.

578
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:34,708
- [Ryan] Hey guys.
How are you guys doing?

579
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,542
- Sup? Life is good.
- Very good. Very chill,

580
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:36,583
I like that.

581
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:37,959
What's your name man?

582
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:38,750
- [Ryan] My name is Ryan.

583
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,542
- Ryan, how are you?

584
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:42,750
- [Ryan] I'm pretty damn
stoked talking to you guys.

585
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,792
- Awesome, what's your question?

586
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,792
- [Ryan] I got a
business related question.

587
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:49,917
I've been working
since I was 18, entrepreneur,

588
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:51,667
been you know, ups
and downs obviously with

589
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:52,959
the first three years

590
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,458
you know, you lose money,
you make money,

591
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,125
it's all up and down stuff.

592
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,583
Definitely to a point, to
where I'm trying to figure out

593
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,542
to where, trying
to get to an employee,

594
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:02,542
to get people under you,

595
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:04,458
I'm not sure what
the right timing is.

596
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,166
Obviously, trying to
juggle 20 different things

597
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,166
from graphic design,
photography, production side

598
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,458
to everything else
but trying to figure out

599
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,667
when is the best
time to ask for help,

600
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:16,542
or how to get the right help.

601
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:19,750
- Can you afford an employee?

602
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,125
- [Ryan] As of right now,
I think we can,

603
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,458
definitely trying to
get to talk to the CPA

604
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,458
and kind of figure
out what's the best move

605
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,041
but that's probably a
question I get, just ask him

606
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,667
to see what the budget would be.

607
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:31,708
- Did you say CPA?

608
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,708
Like you need to
ask your accountant?

609
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,792
- [Ryan] Yeah, to kind of run
down numbers and everything,

610
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:39,333
'cause he does all like the
day-to-day work as far as,

611
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,166
you know, we have the mint
as far as the financial stuff

612
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,375
but he kind of
gives the final decision

613
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,792
"Hey, this is how
much you guys can get paid.

614
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:46,458
"This is how much
you guys can do this."

615
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,125
You know, so on and so forth.

616
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,083
- I mean the
second you can afford,

617
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,125
are you trying to
build a big business?

618
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,333
- [Ryan] Yeah.
I mean that's always, yeah,

619
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,917
that's definitely the
goal to build a big business,

620
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:58,500
something that can
really start running for itself

621
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,375
and not necessarily, hey
we'll leave the business,

622
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,708
but something to where
we can create infrastructure

623
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,250
to really start running for
itself and not just always

624
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,458
trying to catch what the errors
is at the end of the day.

625
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,166
- If you're trying
to build something big,

626
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,917
the second you
can afford an employee

627
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:14,375
is when you need an
employee, and then, because

628
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,959
the reality is you
can't do everything, right?

629
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:18,792
And so if you're
investing in your long term,

630
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:20,458
invest in your long term.

631
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,667
Like, you should
spend no money on anything,

632
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:24,500
you should buy no fancy stuff,

633
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,708
and you should put the
money back into the business

634
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,917
and then, so you can
build up the business right?

635
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:29,750
Too many people
are talking out of

636
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,041
both sides of their mouth,

637
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,875
they want to build
up a big business

638
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,041
but every time they
make a couple of bucks,

639
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,458
a little bit of coin,
they're buying some dumb shit,

640
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,083
like a new pair of Jordans.

641
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,000
- That's real.

642
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,542
- [Ryan] Yeah, that's something
we've invested it to more

643
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:44,041
like, as far as more marketing,

644
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,333
more step services.
Stuff like that.

645
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:50,834
- Do you feel like you
can't get to everything

646
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:52,125
and you really
need that employee?

647
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,291
Obviously you do,
that's why you asked it, right?

648
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:57,083
- [Ryan] Yeah, I mean to
be honest in my aspect of

649
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,542
the business I think
we definitely do.

650
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:01,625
I mean every bit of help is
where you know you try to do

651
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,959
10 different things to
keep the business going.

652
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:05,792
- So, let's break
this down technically.

653
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,792
If you're spending money
that you guys are making,

654
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:09,041
not on dumb shit, thank God,

655
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,625
but on marketing to
get more opportunities,

656
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,917
you're better off
not spending that money

657
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:16,667
on more opportunities
and putting it into employees

658
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:19,375
so that you can then when
you have enough to spend on

659
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:22,291
new marketing opportunities,
take all that opportunity.

660
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,625
If you're getting your
sales ahead of your delivery,

661
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,458
or what you guys can handle.

662
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,750
- Vicious.
- Then you're gonna struggle.

663
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,667
- [Ryan] Okay.

664
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:32,208
- The other thing is,
you brought up something

665
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:34,959
very subtle which
is the right person.

666
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:37,667
It's not about the right
person when you hire them,

667
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:40,333
it's about knowing
when to fire them.

668
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,875
- [Ryan] Gotcha, I think that
is my biggest concern to when--

669
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,792
- Everybody's so
crippled, my man,

670
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:49,083
everybody's so
crippled by the hire.

671
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:51,708
Everybody's got ego
around the hire. They're like,

672
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:54,000
"Oh, I'm so good at this.
I got a process.

673
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,500
"I've got good people skills."

674
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,125
I think I got the best
EQ of all fucking time

675
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,917
and I've hired
so many schlemiels

676
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:01,750
I can't even count 'em.

677
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,458
Because everybody's their best
PR'ed version when they're...

678
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:08,208
When you're trying to hire
somebody, you know how it is,

679
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,500
the cliche, "Hey,
tell me one of your flaws"

680
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,125
"Oh, sometimes I work too hard."

681
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,125
- [Ryan] Yeah, everyone
always says the same things

682
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,083
but you know I got to
get to the real nitty gritty.

683
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,834
- So hire, hire on
that intuition, feel it,

684
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:21,959
and then if it's not
right six months later,

685
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:24,458
three months later or
shit if you know five days,

686
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,792
I've fired people five days in,

687
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:28,708
it might take three or four
months because I wanna be fair

688
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:31,417
but I'm like crap, I'm in
trouble. I just know right away

689
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:33,708
that something
doesn't taste right

690
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,250
so, don't be
crippled by the hiring,

691
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,125
know to be good about the
firing and then you can hire.

692
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,166
You should hire somebody,
by the way, everything

693
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,917
tells me you should
hire somebody tomorrow.

694
00:23:42,917 --> 00:23:44,166
- You're fired.

695
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,917
- [Ryan] Okay,
definitely makes sense.

696
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:47,291
- Alright my man,
thanks for calling.

697
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:48,166
- [Ryan] Perfect.

698
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:49,792
And a quick thing
for both you guys,

699
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:51,750
Logic, I mean you're
absolutely a made act,

700
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,583
I actually do follow your music

701
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,000
and definitely keep it
up, very, very inspiring.

702
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,834
- Thank you dude.

703
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,041
- [Ryan] And Gary, you as well,

704
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,583
both of you
guys are just amazing

705
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,834
and Gary I will definitely
be sending you over a DM

706
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:02,417
to do some
business for you guys first

707
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:03,792
and definitely some
merchandise for you guys.

708
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:04,542
- Thank you my man.

709
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:06,375
So wait, when you saw
that we were both together,

710
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,333
if you're fans were
you just like holy shit?

711
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:10,583
Like peanut butter and jelly?

712
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,250
- [Ryan] I mean,
pretty much, I mean,

713
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,834
I follow your work
as far as your podcast,

714
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:15,083
I listen to it
every single morning

715
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,000
and as far as, you
know, Instagram Live

716
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,417
we're having to
click that (mumbles)

717
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:19,834
because (mumbles)
says I should never

718
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:20,875
watch you on Instagram Live

719
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:21,542
- Got it.

720
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:23,083
- [Ryan] So then, yeah,
I put my number down

721
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,166
a couple of times
and hoped for the best.

722
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:26,458
- Alright my man,
take care of yourself.

723
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:27,333
- Best of luck.

724
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,583
- [Ryan] Thank you, Gary.

725
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,667
- That was, that was
some gangsta ass advice

726
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,333
you just gave that
dude, that's so gangsta.

727
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,792
- Logic, what about you
as an entrepreneur as a kid?

728
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:36,041
So you were very artistic,

729
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,708
you're clearly
artistic and thoughtful.

730
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,750
Did you have a
selling DNA where you like go

731
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,250
and buy Blow Pops
and try to sell 'em?

732
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,291
Like did you have that part?

733
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:43,667
- I'm very ashamed
to tell you a story

734
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:45,875
that I've never
told anyone in my life.

735
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:46,708
- Here we go.

736
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,250
- So, so where I came from-
- Let me get coze.

737
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,041
Yeah so when I grew up,
you know what I'm sayin',

738
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:51,708
I was like hella poor,
I didn't have shit.

739
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:53,792
- Right, you
stole and sold shit?

740
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:54,792
- No.
- Damn.

741
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:55,542
- No.

742
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,166
- Because I think
that's okay. (laughs)

743
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:59,166
- No I went a step further.

744
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:02,417
I created this
like laminate thing

745
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,417
and it was like this whole thing

746
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:06,333
I put it on this like
this gangsta lookin' box

747
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:07,166
(Gary laughs)

748
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:09,083
and it was like
this like metal box

749
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:11,542
and me and my boy
dressed up and we went around

750
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:13,542
and I forget what
the fund was called

751
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:14,917
but it was basically like
the Poor People of America.

752
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:16,208
- Oh, oh, oh.

753
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:17,708
- And we would
knock on people's doors

754
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:18,959
in a rich neighborhood

755
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:21,792
and say, "Would you like to
donate five dollars or more?"

756
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:22,583
'Cause you know
gotta have wiggle room.

757
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:23,667
- Right, right,
right, right, right, right.

758
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:25,291
- So it's like well
even if a dollar works out

759
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:25,959
they're like oh-

760
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:26,625
- Right you had
room to negotiate

761
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,750
- And yeah and like bro,

762
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,625
I mean we must have walked away

763
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:31,000
with like a
couple hundred dollars.

764
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,542
- And what did you do with it?

765
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:34,208
- I fuckin' bought
junk food and shit man,

766
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,208
you know what I'm sayin'?
(Gary laughs)

767
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:37,458
I was poor, I was a
poor person of America.

768
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:38,708
But yeah, no that was it.

769
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:39,417
- I love it.

770
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:41,291
So you, you hey you
had a little of that.

771
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:43,417
- A little slight, a
little somethin' somethin'

772
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,792
but that was like
mischievous hustle.

773
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:45,708
(phone ringing)

774
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:47,458
- Listen I used to rip people's
flowers out of their yards

775
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:48,458
and then ring their doorbell
(phone ringing)

776
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:49,375
and sell 'em right back to them.
(phone ringing)

777
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:50,417
- That's hustle. (Gary laughs)

778
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:52,959
- So everybody starts
with a little bit of that

779
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:55,625
when you're young and
you don't know better.

780
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:56,875
- [Nathan] Hello.

781
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:57,792
- Hello this is GaryVee

782
00:25:57,792 --> 00:26:01,083
and you're on
The #AskGaryVee Show with Logic.

783
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:02,417
- [Nathan] Hey.

784
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:04,917
(Gary and Logic laugh)

785
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:07,917
- So what's your question
and what's your name?

786
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:09,291
- [Nathan] My name is Nathan

787
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:10,834
and my question is like

788
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:13,750
what is your best
advice for startup businesses?

789
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,875
Because like I've been
working on one for three years

790
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,583
and it's just so small,
I don't know what to do.

791
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,625
- Well what kind of
business do you have?

792
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:24,208
- [Nathan] Well
I'm starting to do like

793
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:27,250
branch out on social media like

794
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,542
YouTube and stuff like that.

795
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:34,625
And I have a small
team working on like...

796
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:37,792
Well okay, so I make
beats for smaller rappers.

797
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:40,208
- Okay, that's a good start.

798
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:41,625
So I got a good business idea,

799
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:44,291
I'm gonna trick Logic
into using one of your beats

800
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:45,417
and then you're gonna blow up

801
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:46,834
and everything's gonna be set.

802
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:48,583
- Yeah fam. (Gary laughs)

803
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:49,583
- So wait is this more like,

804
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:52,750
but is this more
like you're trying

805
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,083
to set up your
personal brand via social media,

806
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,000
is that what you're asking,

807
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,208
the best way to go about that?

808
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:57,959
- [Nathan] Yeah.

809
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:59,291
- So you're trying
to become a big producer

810
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:02,000
you wanna be Metro Boomin and
you wanna go in that route?

811
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,333
- [Nathan] Yeah.

812
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,708
- Logic?

813
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:09,875
- My advice here is
interaction with your peers

814
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:12,792
and through that so
say there's other producers

815
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:15,083
so there's a zillion
producers out there, right?

816
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:16,417
So find some of your favorites

817
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:18,917
or some people that you would
almost see as competitors

818
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,166
and collaborate.

819
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:21,417
If you work with somebody else

820
00:27:21,417 --> 00:27:23,083
you guys are always
trying to out do each other

821
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,000
but it's such a
friendly competition

822
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,583
that their listeners on their
YouTube and their Twitter--

823
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:28,417
- Nathan?

824
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:30,542
- are gonna find out that
you guys are working together

825
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:31,417
and they're gonna
wanna hear what you're doin'

826
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:32,458
with this guy or that guy

827
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:35,291
and then through that then
other rappers are gonna start

828
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:36,583
to hear what you
guys are doin' together

829
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:39,125
or even individually
and then wanna mess with you

830
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:42,500
and then that rapper might
have you know 2,000 followers

831
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,000
or 5,000 followers,
whatever the case may be.

832
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,250
So to be quite honest,

833
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,125
I think especially
in this day in age

834
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,750
for personal branding
there's two things,

835
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,458
there's one you should,
you know do little vlogs

836
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:52,667
and talk about who you are

837
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:54,667
and the things that you like
and the things you enjoy,

838
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:57,250
How do you produce?
Is it FL Studio, is it Ableton?

839
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,625
Do you use an MPC,
do you like the keyboard?

840
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:01,625
All these things, do tutorials,

841
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:03,542
how to make beats,
how to this how to that.

842
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:07,708
You want people to tune
in and go, I like this guy.

843
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:09,875
So for everything I want,
I'm gonna come to him.

844
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:11,125
Whether I wanna buy a beat,

845
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:13,125
whether I wanna
learn how to make a beat,

846
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,708
or whatever the case may be
it should be all about you.

847
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:17,458
You wanna be the shit.
You know what I mean?

848
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:18,750
So I would say just have fun

849
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:23,333
and connect with others that
are even better than you,

850
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:24,834
and learn why
they're better than you

851
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:26,959
and fuckin' take
their secrets and kick ass.

852
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:29,208
- Nathan, where do you live?

853
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,834
- [Nathan] I live in Kentucky.

854
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,041
- And how old are you?

855
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:33,125
- Shout out Bryson Tiller.

856
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,375
- [Nathan] I'm 14.

857
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:36,083
- So you've been
doin' it since you were 11?

858
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,708
- I love this.
- [Nathan] Yeah.

859
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:42,125
- So listen, I assume
you love Logic and all that,

860
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:43,542
like have you ever
seen any of my content?

861
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:46,000
Do you know like my
belief on patience at all?

862
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,750
Do you know anything about this?

863
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,625
- [Nathan] Yes, I've been
watching you for like two years.

864
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:51,708
- I love you for that.
Thank you.

865
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:55,041
So here, listen
it's very simple man.

866
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I have a lot of good
things going on in my life.

867
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,083
I would trade to
be you right now.

868
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:02,250
If you're at a place where

869
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,208
you're watching
my Instagram Live

870
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,417
when you're talkin'
to me and Logic,

871
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:06,458
you're 14 years old,

872
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:08,458
you've already put in
three years worth of work,

873
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:11,375
you're savvy enough to be
paying attention to my content

874
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,917
and listening to
this kind of music,

875
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,708
like you're in
such a great spot.

876
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:17,959
The biggest problem
is when you're 14

877
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,917
it's hard to be patient, right?

878
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:22,125
Like, it's just hard but listen,

879
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:23,750
you need to hone your craft.

880
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,917
Like you're still in the place,

881
00:29:24,917 --> 00:29:27,875
if you think about
mine and Logic's stories,

882
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:30,625
at 14 there was
no internet for me,

883
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:31,500
there was for him a little bit

884
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,083
so it's a little
bit different but

885
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:35,208
like we were just
still working on our craft.

886
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,875
I was still at
baseball card shows

887
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:41,000
learning how to like set up
tables, trade, how to negotiate.

888
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,667
Logic, were you
writing at this point?

889
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:43,750
- Oh yeah, I was totally writing

890
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,166
but one other
thing that I do want you

891
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:46,875
to also think about is like

892
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,375
you being 14
it's like you're like

893
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:50,125
oh man I just wanna do it
now, I just wanna do it now,

894
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:50,959
there's a lot of people are like

895
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:51,959
no I don't wanna finish school.

896
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,458
I don't wanna do this
or I don't wanna do that.

897
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,875
Like first and foremost
remember that if you are blessed

898
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,917
and you are in a position
where you can go to school

899
00:29:57,917 --> 00:30:00,583
and get an education you
do not take that for granted

900
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:02,500
because it's something
that I did take for granted.

901
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,333
But one piece of
advice I want to give you

902
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:05,542
and everybody
out there watching,

903
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:07,875
who's like no I just
wanna get rid of everything else

904
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:10,583
and just focus on this
one thing that's BS man

905
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:13,083
because when I was
17 years old I left home

906
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:15,125
and I worked two
jobs at the same time

907
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:16,875
while still working on my music.

908
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:18,667
So no matter how
hard it might feel

909
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:21,000
or how angry it
can be to just want

910
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,708
to do that one
thing all the time,

911
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:25,959
make sure you are balancing
your life. It's very important.

912
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:28,625
- So I'm a bigger
fan of going all-in.

913
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:31,250
I'm not saying quit
school at 14 and this and that

914
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,125
but I feel like
you did go all-in

915
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:35,208
by having two side
jobs that enabled you

916
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,375
to survive in some way
to focus on your music.

917
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:40,000
- Oh completely,
but what I guess--

918
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
- Go ahead.
- what I'm saying is

919
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,041
is that if you're a kid
don't drop out of school

920
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,250
because you just
wanna focus on one thing,

921
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,375
unless there is no other option.

922
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,708
For example, I didn't drop out,

923
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:49,875
I was kicked out of school.

924
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:52,250
- Right. Or, or if the
market told you so.

925
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,583
If you're a 19-year-old

926
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:55,250
and you're the best
basketball player in the world

927
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,708
and the NBA is
ready to pay you--

928
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:57,750
- Oh come on, dawg.
- You drop, right?

929
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,458
- Yeah you get the bread.
- So Nathan, listen.

930
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:00,208
- [Nathan] Yeah.

931
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,875
- I think more than anything,

932
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:05,041
like if you're being
very honest with me and Logic

933
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:07,625
are you good yet?
Like do you think you're great?

934
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:08,708
Do you think
you're like all-time?

935
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:10,875
Do you think you're
like Lil Wayne at 14

936
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,708
and like actually
that great already

937
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:14,834
or do you think you just
still have a long way to go

938
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:17,583
'cause you're just
getting your shit together?

939
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:20,000
- [Nathan] I think I
have a longer way to go

940
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,750
but I do think I do
have some skill at FL Studio.

941
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,041
- Yes, yes.
- Okay, so I love that.

942
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,667
So where are you with social?

943
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:28,291
Have you been promoting?
Are you storytelling?

944
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:30,208
Are you vlogging?
Do you have a vlog on YouTube?

945
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:34,708
Like which I think is just a
great way to go about this.

946
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,083
- [Nathan] I will start that.

947
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:38,083
I'm planning on
getting a camera soon,

948
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,500
it's not gonna be like a big one

949
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,917
but it's gonna
be like cheaper,--

950
00:31:40,917 --> 00:31:42,000
- Do you have a phone?
- [Nathan] I want to be

951
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,417
able to, yeah.

952
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:44,625
- Well then, you have a camera.

953
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:47,208
You have a camera, don't
like overthink the quality.

954
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:49,583
Like, I want you to do the work,

955
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,166
like you gotta taste it. 
- Content.

956
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:52,500
- Like once you have the excuse

957
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,792
that I don't have a camera yet,

958
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:55,041
you're in excuse zone.

959
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:58,708
Film a vlog tomorrow on,
you have an iPhone?

960
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:00,959
- [Nathan] No.
- A Samsung?

961
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:02,083
- [Nathan] But I
have a good camera.

962
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:03,959
- Great, I don't care
what you have, flip phone.

963
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:05,583
Like if you have a
camera on your phone,

964
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:07,250
film it and put it out tomorrow.

965
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:10,417
Promise Logic that you're
gonna make a vlog tomorrow.

966
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:11,667
- Yeah, promise me,
or I'm gonna haunt you.

967
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:12,708
- Promise Logic.

968
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:14,917
- [Nathan] I promise that
I'll make a vlog tomorrow.

969
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:15,708
- Great.
- I love it Nathan.

970
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:18,458
Nathan, listen I'm
Gary@VaynerMedia.com

971
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,542
I want you to
email me in a month

972
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:23,083
about how your vlog's going.

973
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:24,041
- [Nathan] Okay.

974
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:25,708
- Alright, my man?
Good luck to you.

975
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:28,125
- [Nathan] Yeah, thank you.
- You're welcome.

976
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:28,917
I love it.

977
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:30,250
- Yo, what a little boss.

978
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,083
- Isn't that great?
- That was epic.

979
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:36,542
- So listen, to make this
valuable for everybody,

980
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:40,417
are you 26?
- Just turned 27.

981
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,291
- Logic is
twice that dude's age.

982
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:45,750
- Yeah, oh man,
you're making me feel old.

983
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:49,417
- When I was 27 and
looked at 41-year-olds

984
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:52,083
I was like oh that's
like a good size older

985
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:54,375
and the way I feel
right now I feel like a baby.

986
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:55,625
Patience.

987
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,250
Like if you wanna
be great at something,

988
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,375
you've gotta put in the work.

989
00:32:58,375 --> 00:32:59,417
- That's 100%

990
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:02,041
Like do you remember your
first like song you ever made?

991
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:05,166
- I have it written, I have
it in a big ass box upstairs.

992
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:06,417
I have the rap. I have it.

993
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,500
- And, how is it?
- It's, it's horrible.

994
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,708
(Gary laughs)
- It's like the worst shit ever.

995
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:13,500
- I mean, that's it.
- Takes time.

996
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,166
- It just takes time.
- It just takes time.

997
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:17,250
But you gotta
really want it though.

998
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,959
You can't just be bullshitting.

999
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:21,250
- Everybody's
pushing against you.

1000
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,417
- Yeah.
- It's all no's.

1001
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,875
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You start with all no's.

1002
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:25,583
- Yep. And then
you force the yes.

1003
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:27,166
- 100%. I love that.
- Yeah, yeah.

1004
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:29,250
(phone ringing)
- Just start with all no's.

1005
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,041
- No, no, no.

1006
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,875
You start with no's,
and then you.

1007
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:33,291
- [Victor] Hello?
- Hey man, it's GaryVee,

1008
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:35,625
and you're on
The #AskGaryVee Show with Logic.

1009
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,083
- Swag.

1010
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,125
- [Victor] Oh, what's up?

1011
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:40,667
- What's up, man? How are you?

1012
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:42,333
- [Victor] I'm awesome.

1013
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:44,667
- Yeah, you swagging? (laughs)

1014
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:45,583
- [Victor] (laughs) Yeah, man.

1015
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:46,708
Logic, gotta love you, man.

1016
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:48,875
Gary, you're really
inspirational as well.

1017
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:50,583
- I appreciate it, man.
- Thank you.

1018
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:52,250
- So, what kind of
question do you have?

1019
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:55,291
What can we answer for you?

1020
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:56,917
- [Victor] I just feel like

1021
00:33:56,917 --> 00:33:59,375
a lot of things
that I'm trying to do,

1022
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:01,917
that everyone's
against me on them.

1023
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:03,667
- Like everybody, like your mom?

1024
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:04,875
- [Victor] Yeah.
- Like your ideas?

1025
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,250
- [Victor] Like parents
and all that, like friends.

1026
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,750
- Fuck them, no,
I'm just kidding.

1027
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,917
- I believe that, by the way.

1028
00:34:08,917 --> 00:34:10,083
- I mean, to some extent.

1029
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:11,375
- Of course.
- Love your family, but.

1030
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:13,750
- So, what are you up to?

1031
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,458
What's your name again?

1032
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:18,542
- [Victor] What I really
love to do is lacrosse.

1033
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:21,958
Like, I've been playing
lacrosse for four or five years,

1034
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:26,542
and there's
nothing more I enjoy to do.

1035
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:30,542
There's just nothing
that I can really do to

1036
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:33,875
take me to the
next level in the sport.

1037
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,417
- Let me ask you a
question, real quick,

1038
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:36,583
let me ask you one question.

1039
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:39,583
When you say there is nothing
more that you love to do,

1040
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:42,375
when it comes to lacrosse,
do you really mean that?

1041
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:44,958
Do you really mean that there
is nothing more that you love?

1042
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:49,000
Or could you ever see yourself?

1043
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,291
'Cause, one,
you should go for it.

1044
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:51,792
Go for it, if that's
what you want to do,

1045
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:54,500
but I always love to
think long term as well,

1046
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,000
'cause you might
want to play lacrosse,

1047
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,542
but what happens if?

1048
00:34:57,542 --> 00:34:58,667
- You become 41.

1049
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:01,834
- Yes, so, it's like, would
you still want to be involved?

1050
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:04,250
No, I'm just being real, 
age takes a toll on the body,

1051
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,834
so it's like, is playing
lacrosse the only thing that's

1052
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:08,333
ever going to make you happy,

1053
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:12,041
or are there other outcomes as
well that surround lacrosse

1054
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:14,625
that you can go, have a
great career in lacrosse,

1055
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:16,583
but then, also, see
the end result of like

1056
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:18,542
being a commentator
or being a coach?

1057
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:19,667
- This is exactly right.
- Just being involved?

1058
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:21,417
What do you really want?

1059
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:22,333
- Logic's smart.

1060
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:23,500
- When you're 41
years old with a family?

1061
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,875
- [Victor] I just
want to be involved.

1062
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:27,417
Like, I enjoy the creativity,
you know, all of the--

1063
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:28,834
- So, what's the story?

1064
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:30,834
Everybody in your
family and friends say,

1065
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:33,333
even Major League Lacrosse,

1066
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:35,000
it's not like a real lifestyle.

1067
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,458
Like you can't become.

1068
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:37,583
- [Victor] Yeah.
- Got it.

1069
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:38,875
- That's bullshit by the way.

1070
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:43,041
- [Victor] I just
come and go to school,

1071
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:46,750
I've been told
I'm extremely smart,

1072
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,917
but I just don't enjoy school,

1073
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:49,750
so I haven't been trying.

1074
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,667
- How old are you?

1075
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:52,834
- [Victor] I'm fourteen.

1076
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:54,500
- Geez, we're on
fire with 14-year-olds.

1077
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,458
- Killin' it.

1078
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:57,417
- What's your
name again, my man?

1079
00:35:57,417 --> 00:35:58,291
- [Victor] I'm Victor.

1080
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:00,041
- Victor, so listen,
let me give you

1081
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:01,500
a really good piece of advice,

1082
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,959
and make sure your
parents watch this video.

1083
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:06,542
You can always get a job.

1084
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:08,125
- So true (laughs).

1085
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,834
- You can do whatever they want

1086
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,208
and what you want very easily.

1087
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:14,667
You can go and play
lacrosse in college.

1088
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:18,667
You can try out for
Major League Lacrosse teams.

1089
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:20,625
You can either succeed or fail,

1090
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:21,834
but I got good news for you.

1091
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:25,667
When you're 27, which
is a ridiculous young man,

1092
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:27,250
you can just go get a job.

1093
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,583
- That's true,
you can go get a job,

1094
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:30,041
but you can never go back, bro.

1095
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:32,625
You can never go
back to 21 years old

1096
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:36,333
and kind of take
that leap of faith.

1097
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:39,917
You're so young, but like
plan, but just do it, bro.

1098
00:36:39,917 --> 00:36:41,166
Fuck that. (laughs)

1099
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,667
- You love giving
that advice? (laughs)

1100
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,458
- Yeah (laughs).
- Victor, listen, listen.

1101
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,083
You're talking to two guys who

1102
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:48,875
created scenarios in their head.

1103
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:49,917
And they lived it.

1104
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:51,625
And not everybody
goes through that,

1105
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:54,208
so you've got to rationalize
what's going on here,

1106
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:57,041
which is you've got two
ridiculously optimistic people,

1107
00:36:57,041 --> 00:36:59,708
because they've seen
some of what they've wanted to

1108
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:03,417
achieve through in a world
where most people told them no.

1109
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:04,208
Right?

1110
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:07,417
So, but here's where yours
is practical,

1111
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:10,041
like you're 14,

1112
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:12,291
which is like
four seconds ago, right?

1113
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:14,792
So, you've got to factor
that in, how young you are,

1114
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:16,875
but you're going
to be able to do both.

1115
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:18,792
You're going to be
able to make your parents

1116
00:37:18,792 --> 00:37:20,250
and your haters happy,

1117
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,458
'cause you can run
the course of school.

1118
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:26,834
Like right now, just be
ridiculously great at lacrosse

1119
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:29,166
and get a scholarship
and go play at

1120
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:32,208
John Hopkins or
Syracuse or be big time,

1121
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,291
and you've got literally,
literally eight years

1122
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:37,750
until you have to make
a decision if you want to

1123
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,542
become a
professional lacrosse player.

1124
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:43,291
Instead of dwelling on, oh,
everybody doesn't think I can,

1125
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:45,542
go throw the lacrosse
ball against the wall.

1126
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:46,792
- Totally.

1127
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:48,291
- Like just get great.
- [Victor] Yeah.

1128
00:37:48,291 --> 00:37:49,333
- Do you know what I mean?

1129
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,250
Like, none of this
is going to play out

1130
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,250
if you don't get great.

1131
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,625
You're going to lose to
them if you don't get great.

1132
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:57,125
So, like every minute
you even think about it,

1133
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:59,875
turn that into thinking
about how to become great

1134
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:01,708
and put in the
work to become great.

1135
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,792
Let the chips fall.
Listen, I'm 41.

1136
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:05,458
There was a lot of
kids that were told,

1137
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:07,875
stop playing video
games and go get good grades

1138
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,000
and become a lawyer.

1139
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,375
And they're making $137,000
a year right now, miserable,

1140
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:14,792
hate their lives, 'cause they
listened to their parents.

1141
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,250
Yet, they were
actually great at video games,

1142
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,583
and they could be
making $14 million a year

1143
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:22,583
as an e-sports star, but
we didn't know 20 years ago

1144
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:24,959
that Twitch was coming.

1145
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:27,500
Your parents don't
know 11 years from now that

1146
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,708
lacrosse is
now a bigger niche sport,

1147
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:32,208
because the Major League
Lacrosse organization made

1148
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:34,708
a deal with Snapchat,
became the first over-the-top

1149
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:37,667
sport on Snapchat, and
every kid 11 and 19 became a

1150
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:41,625
lacrosse fan, because they
used Snapchat the way that

1151
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:45,667
WWF used, you know, pay for
view and it became a good thing.

1152
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:48,000
- Goddamn, I'm inspired.

1153
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,291
- Do you understand, Victor?

1154
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:51,041
- [Victor] Yeah.

1155
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:53,917
- So, we don't know what
the next decade looks like.

1156
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:56,000
Maybe Major League
Lacrosse players make

1157
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,583
$4 million a year in 10 years.

1158
00:38:57,583 --> 00:39:00,000
I don't think so,
'cause a lot has to happen,

1159
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,792
but it doesn't
matter what I think.

1160
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:05,375
And, more importantly,
if you make $83,000 a year

1161
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:07,792
or $50,000 a year, or be
like an old school athlete.

1162
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:09,917
Do you know major league
baseball players had jobs

1163
00:39:09,917 --> 00:39:11,792
in the summer
in the '50s and '60s.

1164
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:13,834
They loved being
baseball players.

1165
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:15,041
These are fucking
Hall of Famers, Victor.

1166
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:17,208
- Happiness, man.
It's just about happiness, bro.

1167
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:19,125
That's all that
matters is your happiness.

1168
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:20,125
Other people are
going to tell you

1169
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,750
what they think you should do,

1170
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,750
or what they would
do if they were you,

1171
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,041
but they're not you,
bro, they're not you.

1172
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:27,792
So, just be happy,
and do what you love.

1173
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:28,959
Stay passionate.

1174
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:29,917
Be smart.

1175
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:31,542
And have fun, and take risks.

1176
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:34,417
- And be a Wuzzle, a
Wuzzle is a 1984 cartoon,

1177
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:35,792
where two animals
were in one animal.

1178
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:36,500
Be a Wuzzle.

1179
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,041
Be a professional
lacrosse players,

1180
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:39,125
and a fucking doctor.

1181
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:41,333
And Grandma
Fucking Victor is thrilled.

1182
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:42,208
- Swag.

1183
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:44,208
I love how we're talking
to 14-year-old kids today.

1184
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:45,708
It's awesome.

1185
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,750
- [Victor] If you
look at lacrosse,

1186
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:51,375
lacosse is growing
like disgustingly fast.

1187
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:52,500
- Dude, I'm 41.

1188
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,375
Lacrosse has been
growing disgustingly fast

1189
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:56,792
since I was 14, so be careful.
But it doesn't matter.

1190
00:39:56,792 --> 00:39:58,625
Be happy and
execute on your thing.

1191
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:02,542
Don't justify your dreams.
Execute on them.

1192
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:03,875
Ooh.

1193
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,625
- Yo, put that
shit on a shirt, bro.

1194
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:07,458
- That's actually
what "Ooh" was.

1195
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:09,041
Alright, Victor,
we gotta go, my man.

1196
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:09,959
We wish you well.

1197
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:11,375
- [Victor] All right, all right.

1198
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:12,458
See ya, thanks Logic.

1199
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:13,417
- See you.
- Peace, thank you.

1200
00:40:13,417 --> 00:40:14,125
- [Victor] Thanks, Gary.

1201
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:16,667
- Alright, one more.
- Damn that was crucial.

1202
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:17,792
Yo, this is tight.

1203
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:19,417
- This is fun, right?
- This is cool as shit.

1204
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,917
- I'm going to see, Ask Logic,

1205
00:40:20,917 --> 00:40:22,959
in a couple of weeks on YouTube.
I'm going to be excited.

1206
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:25,375
You should do this, man.
- Yeah.

1207
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:27,417
- It's fun, right?
- Yeah, this is dope, thank you.

1208
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:28,291
- You're welcome.

1209
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:29,208
- This is a
really good experience.

1210
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:31,250
- And it's a good way to
scale interaction with fans.

1211
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,834
- I like this energy.

1212
00:40:32,834 --> 00:40:35,708
- Do you think we
should start a morning show?

1213
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:39,291
Like me and you
versus Kelly and Michael?

1214
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:40,125
- Yeah, I know. That'd be great.

1215
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:41,041
- You said you wanted to do TV.

1216
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:42,291
- I'll wear the dress. (laughs)

1217
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:46,250
- (laughs) I'll wear it too.
We'll both wear it.

1218
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,500
- Alright.
- Here we go.

1219
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,750
- You know the person's name?

1220
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,166
Or didn't catch it?

1221
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,250
- Lafonda.

1222
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,500
- Lafonda, you're on
The #AskGaryVee Show.

1223
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,375
- What is it?

1224
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:56,625
(phone ringing)

1225
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:59,667
- Alright, we'll get it.
Relax over there, guys.

1226
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:00,959
Sticking phones in
each other's pockets.

1227
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:01,625
- [Man] Hello?

1228
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,500
- Yo, this is GaryVee and you're on

1229
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,542
The #AskGaryVee Show with Logic.

1230
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:10,125
(phone beeps to end call)
(group laughter)

1231
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:11,083
They got scared.

1232
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:14,041
They were like, you could
hear us in the background,

1233
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:15,250
they got excited.

1234
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,750
Alright, before we
get into last question.

1235
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,542
Logic, what else do
you want everybody to know?

1236
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,041
What else is interesting?

1237
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:21,708
What's on your mind?

1238
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:22,417
- I don't know, man.

1239
00:41:22,417 --> 00:41:24,917
I just think one thing
about all of this and just

1240
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:26,708
kind of sitting down
here and talking today

1241
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:29,291
it just shows me like, you know,
you're very successful

1242
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:30,917
in your field. I'd like
to think I'm very successful

1243
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:32,417
in mine.
- You are, you are.

1244
00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:35,750
- And like, all that
matter is that we're happy.

1245
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,166
I know that when
I wake up every day.

1246
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:39,125
Like literally, I only
have one tattoo and it's

1247
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:40,458
"Happy wife, happy life."

1248
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:43,667
I'm happy with my wife,
I'm happy with my friends,

1249
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,041
I'm happy with my
career and I don't know

1250
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:50,083
why I'm saying this
but I wasn't truly happy

1251
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:53,417
until I stopped looking
for acceptance in others.

1252
00:41:53,417 --> 00:41:55,667
- Don't justify your dream.
- That's a real thing.

1253
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:58,041
I wasn't truly
happy until I could say,

1254
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:59,834
"No, fuck you if you
don't like this or that."

1255
00:41:59,834 --> 00:42:01,625
I did it because
it made me happy.

1256
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:02,792
- It's the best feeling, man.

1257
00:42:02,792 --> 00:42:03,583
- Whoever you are out there,
(phone ringing)

1258
00:42:03,583 --> 00:42:06,542
do what you do
for yourself, please.

1259
00:42:06,542 --> 00:42:07,708
- They'll come to you if you do.

1260
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:08,708
- And buy my albums. 
No, just kidding.

1261
00:42:08,708 --> 00:42:10,667
(group laughter)

1262
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:14,583
- That will make you happy.

1263
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:18,250
(phone ringing)

1264
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,375
- [Sebastian] Hello?

1265
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:23,166
- This is GaryVee and you're on
The #AskGaryVee Show with Logic.

1266
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,792
- [Sebastian] Oh my God.
Are you for real?

1267
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,542
- I'm super for real,
my man, what's your name

1268
00:42:26,542 --> 00:42:28,125
and where you from?

1269
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:31,208
- [Sebastian] Holy crap,
oh my God.

1270
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:33,834
My name's Sebastian.
I'm 15, I'm from South Carolina.

1271
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:34,667
- Alright, Sebastian.

1272
00:42:34,667 --> 00:42:36,000
South Carolina
in the Final Four,

1273
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,166
you guys all freaking out there?

1274
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:40,041
Is South Carolina
like shut down?

1275
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,792
- [Sebastian] Yeah, man,
totally Gamecocks.

1276
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:43,291
They can take it all, so.

1277
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:44,375
- You feelin' good about it?

1278
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:46,417
Now don't lie, what
was your name again?

1279
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:47,875
I apologize,
I'm getting excited.

1280
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:50,250
- [Sebastian] Sebastian.
- Sebastian, did you have them?

1281
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,834
Where'd you have
them in your bracket?

1282
00:42:51,834 --> 00:42:53,959
Don't bullshit Logic.

1283
00:42:53,959 --> 00:42:55,250
- I don't give a
shit about sports.

1284
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,417
- [Sebastian] I didn't
make a bracket

1285
00:42:56,417 --> 00:42:59,125
but I'm just happy
they're in the Final Four.

1286
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:00,375
- You didn't make a
bracket, that upsets me.

1287
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:02,333
Alright, what's your question?

1288
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:05,542
- [Sebastian] Alright,
so basically like,

1289
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:09,291
I'm stuck between
I just want to do YouTube

1290
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:12,625
and just film my life

1291
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:14,834
or starting a business.

1292
00:43:14,834 --> 00:43:17,000
You think I
could collab with them

1293
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,375
or stick to one or--

1294
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:20,041
- First of all, bro,
I'm going to interrupt you

1295
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:22,250
and tell you right now
that you filming yourself

1296
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,667
and doing vlogs
is a business, bro.

1297
00:43:24,667 --> 00:43:26,542
So that's knocking two birds
with one stone right there.

1298
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:28,417
- If you're interesting,
Sebastian.

1299
00:43:28,417 --> 00:43:30,166
If you're boring as shit,
nobody's going to watch

1300
00:43:30,166 --> 00:43:32,208
and you're not
going to make any money.

1301
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:33,083
- [Sebastian] Okay.

1302
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:35,208
- (stammering)
You need to understand this.

1303
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:36,667
This is the one thing that
everybody has to understand

1304
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:39,583
because this is a phenomenon
because I wrote a book

1305
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:42,125
when you were like zero, 
you were like seven years old.

1306
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:44,000
It was called, Crush It!,
and I talked about

1307
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,041
the emergence of
YouTube, this thing,

1308
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:48,500
and it's so fun for me to
now see this in real life.

1309
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,166
Like 15 year olds are like,
"Yo, I want to do YouTube."

1310
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:52,792
That's insane to me.

1311
00:43:52,792 --> 00:43:55,625
That makes me so happy
that I was right, I guess.

1312
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:57,959
But here's the problem.

1313
00:43:57,959 --> 00:44:00,917
All of you want to do YouTube.

1314
00:44:00,917 --> 00:44:03,792
All of South Carolina
15-year-olds want to do YouTube.

1315
00:44:03,792 --> 00:44:06,583
All of North Carolina
15-year-olds want to do YouTube.

1316
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:08,000
Everybody wants to do YouTube.

1317
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,291
Everybody wants to be a rapper.

1318
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:10,917
Everybody wants to
be an entrepreneur.

1319
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:12,959
Everybody wants
to be in the NBA.

1320
00:44:12,959 --> 00:44:15,792
What you need to figure
out is not only what you want

1321
00:44:15,792 --> 00:44:18,250
but are you good enough
to be able to pull it off?

1322
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,125
- Damn, that's crucial.
- [Sebastian] Okay.

1323
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:21,542
- You know what I mean?

1324
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:23,291
You understand where
I'm coming from, Sebastian?

1325
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:24,583
I'll tell you this.

1326
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:27,083
You won't know unless you start.

1327
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:28,917
- Yeah, it's true.

1328
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:30,166
Yeah, do it.
- [Sebastian] Okay.

1329
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:31,625
- You see what I mean?

1330
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:35,125
Like you just won't
know unless you start doing

1331
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:38,708
if you're great,
charismatic, funny, interesting,

1332
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:41,417
like by the way, right
now is the time to start.

1333
00:44:41,417 --> 00:44:43,417
Everybody's paying
attention to South Carolina.

1334
00:44:43,417 --> 00:44:46,458
You're in the Final Four,
document the next three days.

1335
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:50,125
Go into like Wendy's and see
what people are talking about,

1336
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:51,834
go and do.

1337
00:44:51,834 --> 00:44:53,875
- Yeah.
- [Sebastian] Okay, okay.

1338
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:57,625
- Hey, what's the
last thing you ate?

1339
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:58,959
- [Sebastian] What's
the last thing I hate?

1340
00:44:58,959 --> 00:45:00,500
- Yeah.
- Ate, ate, not hate.

1341
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,291
Don't hate anything.

1342
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:05,000
- Hate taxes.
- [Sebastian] Cereal.

1343
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,333
- Nice.
- Which one?

1344
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:09,417
- [Sebastian] Cinnamon
Toast Crunch.

1345
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:11,000
- That's a good one,
that's a good one.

1346
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,166
- Nice.
- What's your favorite cereal?

1347
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:13,250
- My favorite cereal? Pussy.

1348
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,917
No, I'm just kidding.
(Gary laughs)

1349
00:45:15,917 --> 00:45:19,250
Cap'n Crunch.
- Me too, me too, the Captain.

1350
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,166
Sebastian.

1351
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:22,041
- [Sebastian] Yes, sir.

1352
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:24,542
- I don't feel like
I'm leaving this call

1353
00:45:24,542 --> 00:45:28,083
with you actually
doing a vlog tomorrow.

1354
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:30,000
- [Sebastian] Okay,
well, here's the thing,

1355
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,208
I have one video on my
YouTube and I'm currently

1356
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:34,291
focused on my Instagram.

1357
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:37,208
I have videos on
my Instagram, so.

1358
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:39,333
- What's your Instagram account?

1359
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:43,667
- My Instagram is @im and then
my name, Sebastian Betancur.

1360
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:45,792
- How do you
spell your last name?

1361
00:45:45,792 --> 00:45:50,583
- B-E-T-A-N-C-U-R. Check me
out for some funny videos.

1362
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:52,625
- I'm going to
pull this up right now

1363
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:54,750
because I've got great news.

1364
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:57,708
So you know who Logic is, right?

1365
00:45:57,708 --> 00:45:59,542
- [Sebastian] Yeah.

1366
00:45:59,542 --> 00:46:02,166
- Logic's going to
follow you on Instagram.

1367
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:03,166
- [Sebastian] Oh my God!

1368
00:46:03,166 --> 00:46:05,417
- Yeah dude, can you believe it?

1369
00:46:05,417 --> 00:46:06,917
He's the best.
(DRock laughs)

1370
00:46:06,917 --> 00:46:09,834
- [Sebastian] This is the best
day of my life, oh my God.

1371
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:11,500
- Okay, I'm Sebastian now what?

1372
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:17,083
- [Sebastian] B-E-T-A-N-C-U-R.

1373
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:21,875
- Dude, Logic, you're
such a good dude for following

1374
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:23,542
this dude.
- What is it, what is it?

1375
00:46:23,542 --> 00:46:26,750
- I'm Sebastian but I don't
have the last name down yet.

1376
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:30,667
- Hold on, spell Sebastian
just so we don't screw it up.

1377
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:33,500
- Yo, Sebastian.
[Sebastian] Did you find it?

1378
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,834
- Not yet, bro. Spell Sebastian.

1379
00:46:36,834 --> 00:46:39,000
- [Sebastian] Alright,
it's I am--

1380
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,041
- Oh I am. Hold on,
hold on, my fault. Hold on.

1381
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:46,041
I am Sebastian,
I found you, bro!

1382
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:48,750
- [Sebastian] Oh my God,
this is insane, Gary!

1383
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,500
- Yeah, Sebastian.

1384
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,917
- Yo Sebastian, you've got
2,500 followers, bro!

1385
00:46:52,917 --> 00:46:55,959
- You have 2,438 followers

1386
00:46:55,959 --> 00:46:59,291
and your 2,439th
follower is Logic.

1387
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:01,792
Sebastian,
do you understand, bro,

1388
00:47:01,792 --> 00:47:03,041
do you understand

1389
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:05,333
that in a couple of
minutes you're going to be able

1390
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:08,125
to text friends and be
like, "Yo, Logic follows me

1391
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:10,792
"on Instagram," and
everybody in South Carolina

1392
00:47:10,792 --> 00:47:13,125
is going to shit their pants.

1393
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:17,083
- [Sebastian] Yeah dude. Logic,
please don't ever unfollow me.

1394
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:18,333
(group laughter)

1395
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:19,500
I look up to you so much.

1396
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,041
- I am, I am, I did
the same thing.

1397
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:22,667
- Oh, I am!
- No, you put I.

1398
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:24,333
I am! 
- Yeah, got to put I am.

1399
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:25,208
Fix it, fix it.

1400
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:26,125
Logic, while you
were trying to find him,

1401
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:27,375
did you hear what he said?

1402
00:47:27,375 --> 00:47:28,000
- Yeah.

1403
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,542
- He said, "Don't
unfollow me, bro."

1404
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:30,375
- Oh, I'm going to
unfollow you as soon

1405
00:47:30,375 --> 00:47:32,458
as this interview's over.
(group laughter)

1406
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:34,041
What the hell? I can't do it.

1407
00:47:34,041 --> 00:47:35,792
- [Sebastian] Gary, I just
want to thank you so much

1408
00:47:35,792 --> 00:47:39,834
for calling me, I love
all your videos so much.

1409
00:47:39,834 --> 00:47:43,333
Honestly, you're just a
motivational person, man.

1410
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:44,291
- I appreciate it, bro.

1411
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:47,250
Listen, I have good news,
I'm a better dude than Logic.

1412
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:50,834
I just followed you and I'm
not going to unfollow you.

1413
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:54,166
- I'm not going
to unfollow you, bro.

1414
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:57,959
- Dude, dude, look at right now.

1415
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:01,417
Boom, there's Logic, dude
and DRock just followed you.

1416
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:03,417
Bro! DRock followed you.

1417
00:48:03,417 --> 00:48:06,625
- [Sebastian] Oh my God,
this is so crazy.

1418
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:09,166
I just got 30 followers.

1419
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:10,333
Thank you so much, man.

1420
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:13,166
- Now, Sebastian, here's the
key, who's the first person

1421
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:16,375
you're about to
text as soon as you

1422
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:18,500
and I get off this phone?

1423
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,583
- [Sebastian] You know,
I think my dad.

1424
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:22,041
- Your dad?

1425
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:23,291
- [Sebastian] Yeah.
- That's beautiful, man.

1426
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:25,208
I love it.
- Yo, this kid's adorable.

1427
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:26,458
Yo, can I have your hair?

1428
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:29,041
- Yeah, bro, your hair is legit.
- It's legit.

1429
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:30,458
- [Sebastian] Thank you
so much, man.

1430
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:32,917
- Yo, you can
braid that shit, dawg.

1431
00:48:32,917 --> 00:48:35,083
- Dude, you got
some nice photos.

1432
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:36,166
- This is hilarious.

1433
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:37,625
- Bryson Cooker, I like it, man.

1434
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:40,083
You're doing your thing.
- You got it.

1435
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:40,875
- [Sebastian] Thank you.

1436
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:43,583
- Hey, listen,
listen, put out more content.

1437
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:45,250
I see what you're doing.
I like it.

1438
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:48,083
Now, you've got to put
more hashtags in your posts.

1439
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:50,375
You've got six or seven
or eight, you need more.

1440
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:51,458
- Yeah, hashtag it.
- [Sebastian] Okay.

1441
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:54,125
- And the other thing is, who
do you think you are, Logic?

1442
00:48:54,125 --> 00:48:57,125
You need to reply to every
single person that's leaving

1443
00:48:57,125 --> 00:49:02,041
a comment and giving you love
because it makes no sense.

1444
00:49:02,041 --> 00:49:03,291
- [Sebastian] Yeah,
I understand.

1445
00:49:03,291 --> 00:49:04,834
- Dude, you know
what else is crazy?

1446
00:49:04,834 --> 00:49:06,583
Are you paying
attention to what's going on?

1447
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:09,458
Your latest picture
has all sorts of people

1448
00:49:09,458 --> 00:49:10,959
commenting that
they're watching you right now.

1449
00:49:10,959 --> 00:49:13,000
- I just liked
your last one too, dawg.

1450
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,625
Your last, there you go.

1451
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:17,875
- I'm going to
like the one that

1452
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:21,625
you said, "Girls are weird,"
and I'm going to like it.

1453
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,375
- Girls are weird.
My wife's weird.

1454
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:24,917
- Don't let those
girls fuck you up, alright?

1455
00:49:24,917 --> 00:49:26,500
- My wife fucked me up.
- [Sebastian] Okay.

1456
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,166
- Alright, brother, good luck.

1457
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:29,458
- [Sebastian] Thank you so much.

1458
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:30,750
That's amazing.

1459
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:31,625
I love you guys.

1460
00:49:31,625 --> 00:49:33,583
- I love you more, Sebastian.

1461
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:35,375
Can I get an "I love
you, Sebastian" shirt?

1462
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:36,792
(bell dings)
Can we get that done?

1463
00:49:36,792 --> 00:49:38,417
Alright. I'm being dead serious.

1464
00:49:38,417 --> 00:49:40,458
I'm wearing an
"I love you Sebastian" shirt

1465
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:42,458
and then like a Logic
fan's going to roll up at me

1466
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:43,917
like wearing it, guarantee it.

1467
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:45,708
Alright, we're done with that.

1468
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:47,250
- Logic?
- Yes.

1469
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,041
- You're a good dude.
- You're a good dude.

1470
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:50,250
- I love you.
- We're good dudes.

1471
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:51,708
- Now, question of the day.

1472
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:54,041
You get to ask everybody
the question of the day.

1473
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:55,792
There'll be
thousands of comments

1474
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:58,625
in Facebook and
YouTube to this question.

1475
00:49:58,625 --> 00:49:59,542
What's the question
you wanna put out

1476
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:02,291
to the 13, 14, 15-year-olds

1477
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,291
and everybody else in the world,

1478
00:50:04,291 --> 00:50:05,959
what would you
like to see them answer?

1479
00:50:05,959 --> 00:50:06,834
Might be a good
opportunity for you to

1480
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:08,875
get a little bit
of a feedback loop.

1481
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:10,417
You might be able
to get some insight

1482
00:50:10,417 --> 00:50:12,542
on something from the masses.

1483
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:13,917
- I didn't know that
you were gonna ask me this.

1484
00:50:13,917 --> 00:50:14,750
- I know, that's why I,

1485
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,500
and notice how I didn't give
you that heads up beforehand.

1486
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,750
'Cause this awkward pause
right now is everything to me.

1487
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,834
I'm gonna rewind
and watch this part.

1488
00:50:26,542 --> 00:50:27,625
Shhh.

1489
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:30,166
This is gonna be
an amazing question.

1490
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:31,208
I'm predicting
the greatest question

1491
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:32,667
asked by a guest in the history

1492
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:34,333
of The #AskGaryVee Show.

1493
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:35,583
- Why do you think--

1494
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:37,625
- Oh, this is
gonna be good actually.

1495
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:42,750
- Jesus, 'kay Gandhi,

1496
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:47,583
and Martin Luther King, JFK,

1497
00:50:47,583 --> 00:50:49,458
John Lennon,

1498
00:50:49,458 --> 00:50:53,000
so many more amazing people

1499
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,625
who only spread love
and peace and happiness

1500
00:50:57,625 --> 00:51:01,166
and that message were
killed for their cause?

1501
00:51:01,166 --> 00:51:03,041
I wanna know why,
why you think that.

1502
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:06,458
I'm just curious.
I have my reason to why I think,

1503
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:08,291
but I don't know,
I just feel like--

1504
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:09,125
- You're curious.

1505
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:12,417
- why so many
incredible amazing figures

1506
00:51:12,417 --> 00:51:16,834
that were just
loving and happy met...

1507
00:51:16,834 --> 00:51:20,166
- That fate.
- That fate.

1508
00:51:20,166 --> 00:51:22,083
- Continued success, man.
- Thank you, you too.

1509
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:23,000
- You got a real talent.
- Appreciate it.

1510
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,041
- And a great, great vibe, man.
I enjoyed this so much.

1511
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:26,542
You keep asking questions,

1512
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:28,083
we'll keep answering them.

What do you have to say?

1516
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:35,375
What are you saying?
What's going on?

1517
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:37,166
Get some fuckin' money.
Let's do this!
