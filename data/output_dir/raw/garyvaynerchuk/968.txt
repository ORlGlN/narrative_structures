social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think believe it or</font>

72
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,370
that it was all over itunes and in front

73
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">of all our faces i'm even have to be at</font>

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think beyonce does social well to</font>

77
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,020
be honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you I think it's kind of</font>

78
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,050
lead us the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> of engaging with her</font>

79
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,850
community or doing anything different on

80
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,130
social that she does a traditional media

81
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,590
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm being social had a lot of doing</font>

82
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I think what I'd love to do with it</font>

83
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,660
was she's fucking legit has been famous

84
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,820
for a long fucking time and put out a

85
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,920
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of good content so I want to</font>

86
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,650
oversell the social<font color="#CCCCCC"> dessert social</font>

87
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,620
deserves credit for me right who had no

88
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,990
platform and nobody knew and I used the

89
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,750
tools to build myself up Beyonce at this

90
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,120
level I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think had more to do with the</font>

91
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,550
exposure she was able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get from itunes</font>

92
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,250
and then sort of that we're social came

93
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,090
in is it might be Jackson the same thing

94
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,260
ten years ago what so he didn't Beyonce

95
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,329
was when that came out people found it

96
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,350
interesting and what you

97
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,270
really is guys the way at least I think

98
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,640
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is it the plumbing for word of</font>

99
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,010
mouth in our society right so he is

100
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,380
flying right and we'd love to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> each</font>

101
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,480
other things and so what happened was as

102
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,570
I caught buzz social amplify the

103
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,430
awareness so maybe there was an

104
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,290
awareness factor may be whether it was

105
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,080
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> or faster that's where social</font>

106
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,200
played into a play but she had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the grand</font>

107
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,330
advocated the structure for that to be

108
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,810
successful maybe people bother albums

109
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,910
quicker because they became aware of it

110
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,130
quicker in their fees because of social

111
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,950
but I wouldn't save Social some of those

112
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,580
hours so you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> socialblade more of I</font>

113
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,860
guess it's not really a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tabbed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

114
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,330
was really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a right hook for you can</font>

115
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,510
see it really<font color="#CCCCCC"> engage them leave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that as</font>

116
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,510
a catalyst of several<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours I think</font>

117
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,240
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> about self stuff I always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have I</font>

118
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,580
think anybody here if your salesperson

119
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">business person live in the world you</font>

120
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,810
realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you every person here has</font>

121
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,420
bought has been their<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard-earned money</font>

122
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,700
on things because somebody they trust or

123
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,950
no said something was good but there was

124
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,110
a restaurant an album of beverage

125
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,450
whatever it is we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> now living in a</font>

126
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,640
world where we all think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> our word</font>

127
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">of mouth is valuable right like we</font>

128
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,310
default like if we're all watching the

129
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,380
same show like we're all going to watch

130
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,760
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Super Bowl and when something</font>

00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens you leave here entitled to</font>

132
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,600

133
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,250
cents on that fucking cash

134
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">titan to our two cents that we never had</font>

135
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,110
before and so it's creating more volume

136
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,970
of word of mouth we're consuming each

137
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,460
others opinions and thoughts it's

138
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,229
changing the course of the way to make

139
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,750
decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> not only about what we buy how</font>

140
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,080

I take it very seriously and I get very

355
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,800
mad at people I did what I had 100

00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,360
followers when i had a hundred followers

357
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,450
on twitter i was like on drink people

358
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,260
when I said this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> salsa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right amount</font>

359
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,760
of people that because they see other

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,200
people have a million<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't respect the</font>

361
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,910
572 followers they have and then worried

00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,050
about how am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I going to get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a million</font>

363
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,780

00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,370
you're not getting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thousand is</font>

365
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,290
because you're not respecting your 572

00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,050
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> million was respecting</font>

370
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,230

373
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,310

00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,830
bringing me awareness to convert later

381
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,170
down the line the biggest problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

382
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,450
now in the game is that everybody wants

383
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,270

407
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,680
reason I write for media and the reason

that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> never heard of me so the</font>

425
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,360

dollars to give a why our keynote I

430
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,559

criticism or comments on articles or

778
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,460

that you don't know and that's my first

780

food as a matter fact I've spent a lot

00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,790
of time in the last 12 months trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

782
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,620
do a better job responding the positive

783

feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I was just spending all</font>

784
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,270
my time we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop feeding the trolls</font>

785
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,010
right like feeding the negative instead

<font color="#E5E5E5">of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thanking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the positive you can</font>

788
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,270
start let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with a very different</font>

789
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,670
angle on why I respond to people's David

790
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:39,190
comments because for the most part<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

791
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,980
believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they believe it like I</font>

792
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,350
think I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they think I stink</font>

793
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,810
or that this was bad or I was wrong on

794
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,520
this so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say is</font>

795
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,890
I'm a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> concerned that all of a</font>

796
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,080
sudden anybody disagrees with you or

797
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,270
leaves a negative comment is it true I

798
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,890
look at it as<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody who just has a</font>

799
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,470
different point of view and I respect if

800
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,910
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be if I'm gonna take all the</font>

801
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,400
athletes I'm gonna take the negative B

802
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,440
lab not to mention you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can learn from it</font>

803
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,650
my knees and feet

804
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,570
last eight years on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

805
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,179
formed I have changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> uncertain things</font>

806
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:13,399
like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I've done tighter like I</font>

807
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:15,020
try not to exaggerate ever because

808
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,639
everything's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the record like I'm</font>

809
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,350
doing everything I've got better because

810
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,090
of it so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing I would say to</font>

811
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,649
you man<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know if somebody's</font>

812
00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:23,510
malicious or using slurs or

813
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,460
inappropriate actually just<font color="#E5E5E5"> dead the</font>

814
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,710
variable but you know first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

815
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,449
should respect somebody else's point of

816
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:31,010
view I think it's healthy for you to

817
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,230
address in and engage it can teach you

818
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,820
something I think it has enormous value

819
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,630
I mean I respond to my negativity an

820
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,699
awful lot I would tell you that my<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

821

823
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:52,370
navigation I mean that's it the good

824
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the bad that is beneficial I've</font>

around that more people<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading into an</font>

00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:31,290
social media and you need the jobs act

845
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,609

849
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,859
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to take advantage of</font>

850
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:07,080
the fact that before we get a good 25

851
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,089
and 50 thousand other checks for me and

852
00:36:09,089 --> 00:36:10,740
not everybody had<font color="#E5E5E5"> the skills to build a</font>

853
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,390
bit of product or be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sell</font>

854
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,460
somebody to write that kind of chat but

supply-demand a more crap product so i

862

happen is a locking rhythms<font color="#CCCCCC"> lotta money</font>

it will be even worse<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm completely</font>

865
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,650
positive one of the products to blow off

of below average product that's talent

870
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,990
there is news source backdrop is our

871
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,330
degrees now cover five six years ago is

872
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,310
a lot of dumb bunny there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

874
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,930

875
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,850
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more dumb on</font>

unlimited on money right everybody put

00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:10,100
either 50 bucks I think we're going to

878
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,110
see him look like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> kickstart if you</font>

879
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,700
watched a starter look at the products

880
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've got a lot of great product but my</font>

881
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,760
percentage it's changed as become more

882
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,840
mass and so I'm concerned that you know

883
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,060
I hope people just I'm very<font color="#CCCCCC"> worried that</font>

884
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a lot of attacks on the</font>

885
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,330
dreamers I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> very concerned about it we</font>

886
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

887
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:35,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the checks some things that have no</font>

888
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,330
prayer so I'm thinking you know it's

889
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">funny but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've been thinking about</font>

890
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,890
this a lot how do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> like help without</font>

891
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,960
coming across like a cynic because I'm

892
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,850
in that game right I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

893
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:49,850
figured it out again but you know on the

894
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,850
flipside being an optimist everything

895
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,710
hope there are 20 to 100 companies that

896
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,970
are formed that would have never had a

897
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,740
chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're like two kids in</font>

898
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,090
Kansas that would have not had access

899
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:01,130
below in the way that Kickstarter has

900
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,800
done some great stuff is I what I

901
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,060
actually think is going to happen is

902
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,619
what happened d<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet bubble I think</font>

903
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:07,790
I'm front there's going to be a frenzy

904
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,530
think a lot of people lose money the

905
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,930
lead correction will calm down and I

906
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:12,859
think it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be much more</font>

907
00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:16,850
beneficial and exciting in 2020 then it

908
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:19,010
will be for the next half decade thank

909
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:22,990
you yeah big lesson I think that's a

910
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:30,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">thanks only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> choice first of all diving</font>

and got<font color="#E5E5E5"> over 20,000 engagements and</font>

917
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook was measuring our CPC at zero</font>

918
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,890
sense it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually less than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Pena</font>

919
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,150

content in your books everywhere you

talk about giving value building<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

924
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:02,090
audience by giving value and it kind of

925
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,250
comes back in a variety of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

926
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,570
ways and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what we do we are</font>

927
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:07,580
businesses in three pieces and we give

928
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,900
value in three very different ways to

929
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">three very different audiences with in</font>

930
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,950
one industry but it's focused on

931
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,530
partnerships to<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how do you form</font>

932
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,210
your partnerships how do you structure

those how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start them how how do</font>

934
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a place where you're working</font>

935
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,980
with someone on a regular basis

936
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,990
cohesively what are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for me</font>

937
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:30,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">myself you yourself so partnerships come</font>

938
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,840
in so many ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> and forms right like to</font>

939
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,820
partnerships I've only had to my dad and

940
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:38,270
my brother right partnerships coming in

941
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,400
form of you know we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> touring my</font>

942
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,560
employees where it's not about the

943
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,420
business about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a relationship</font>

944
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,010
partnership are you talking about the

945
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,590
actual business<font color="#E5E5E5"> way no</font>

946
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:51,380
lo guys other than that but less

947
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,480
specific so we ago I have my<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

948
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,620
partner and then we have a few equity

949
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,530
partners but one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

950
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:58,790
do is kind of act as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a digital</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agency</font>

951
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,800
for people who are influential in our

952
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,580
space and so we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> by interviewing</font>

953
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,900
them on our podcast and they started

954
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,670
asking us for four things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we were</font>

955
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,690
already planning<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give but they</font>

956
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:09,980
started knocking on her door wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

957
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,170
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we want to provide them now so</font>

958
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,730
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep up with their need</font>

959
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:15,530
and grow with it but there's all these

960
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,090
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> types of partnerships so how</font>

961
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:19,310
do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ceiling for other partners to</font>

962
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:21,200
provide the services that these<font color="#CCCCCC"> google</font>

963
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">offers you can't get some YY content</font>

964
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,460
partnerships audience partnerships

965
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,080
mutual win-win value-driven how do you

966
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,330
the my biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with something</font>

967
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,850
like that for me you may not have people

968
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,470
have this month with his<font color="#CCCCCC"> house</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> policeman</font>

969
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:36,320
for me is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a real specific</font>

970
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,020
reason that I was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dnf student you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

971
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,060
people always think it was cuz oh he

972
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,430
must have been so entrepreneur that he

973
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,380
didn't give up right truth is like I

974
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,230
really hate details right I don't like

975
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">them all that much and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so from you to do</font>

976
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,430
a true partnership I need to dig I'm

977
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,930
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my name on something and say</font>

978
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:56,030
hey we're put this guy hey work with

979
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:58,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">this girl I had to dig I didn't need to</font>

980
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,110
know and so I just stay away from a lot

981
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,850
of stuff because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm all the time or</font>

982
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,380
patience to actually put in all the

983
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,030
world to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it give that recommendation</font>

984
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,810
to answer your question

985
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,790
first of all you to put in the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

986
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,130
won't you send<font color="#E5E5E5"> these people to that they</font>

987
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:12,630
actually can execute on it right because

988
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,950
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> faking going on out there I</font>

989
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to bother with you here's revenue I</font>

990
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,770
would do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the order to figure out who's</font>

991
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,110
the best in class to provide value for

992
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:24,090
the people to transcend and then once

993
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,860
you find them you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to go to that</font>

994
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,320
individual or organization and provide

995
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,000
that more value than they're providing

996
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,550
to you and so one of the ways to do that

997
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:34,830
is to do a referral to them without

998
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:37,230
asking for any referral fee because now

999
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,280
they don't think you're just trying to

1000
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,260
cite that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20-percent big for just</font>

1001
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,120
seven eight email right like people

1002
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">always are like Gary one of those sales</font>

1003
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,870
for you I don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> your fucking sales</font>

1004
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,150
right like I'm you twenty percent me to

1005
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,970
get it anyway thanks Joe you know it so

1006
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:54,150
and so I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would do I</font>

1007
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,800
would audit when you think is best<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1008
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,930
then I think you should attack them and

1009
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,460
provide that more value than you're

1010
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,820
asking thank you very much the<font color="#CCCCCC"> value</font>

1011
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">addition of irritation</font>

1012
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,579
my name is Andrew and I love what you do

1013
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:11,099
and I watched at least six hours of your

1014
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:12,930
presentations the different companies

1015
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,240
online and one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1016
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk a lot about its contents yes</font>

1017
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:19,710
creating context with individuals in and

1018
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,079
you personalize it with even individuals

1019
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the audience yes just I guess even</font>

1020
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:26,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">give some additional tips to that</font>

1021
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,530
present day like how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get contacts</font>

1022
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,810
now you know context is around<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1023
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:33,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">about hops right on even look like I to</font>

1024
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">convert I mean when I sit down to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> signal</font>

1025
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,859
I look at as many of your faces as I

1026
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:40,349
could to try to demo up this audience

1027
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:43,410
right like context is at all times you

1028
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,329
know I'm always thinking about context I

1029
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:48,060
mean context<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is the bedrock of a</font>

1030
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,250
good storytelling good salesmanship good

1031
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">providing value so you know I don't know</font>

1032
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:54,839
how to go deeper to what I'm talking

1033
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:56,720
about but here's what I would say it's

1034
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,910
kind of like it's religion versus in

1035
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,579
church right like the religion doesn't

1036
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:04,140
change but the way you build a church

1037
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,210
has a lot to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community and where you</font>

1038
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">are you might throw my both outdoor</font>

1039
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:09,930
church in a warm weather place you know

1040
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:12,089
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's just nuances so to me I'm</font>

1041
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,730
always in context mode right like where

1042
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:15,900
do you comfort that challenge from

1043
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,670
Vermont and that literally was a

1044
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:20,400
contextual spent in my mind you said

1045
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,230
into not handy like I think about shit

1046
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:24,869
like that I'm serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm contacting at</font>

1047
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:27,420
all times what<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are giving me so</font>

1048
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,339
that when I give in return it has a

1049
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,819
better chance of landing on the spot

1050
00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:33,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">nobody's I talk a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about context</font>

1051
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,670
right now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> because social media is</font>

1052
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,920
bold into one thing and the difference

1053
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,849
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook Twitter Tumblr</font>

typically the one that does an Instagram

collecting data all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> different data</font>

1078
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,090
points they're all context I don't know

1079
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:32,890
how to go any deeper than the fact that

1080
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:36,430
it's not you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you keep saying except</font>

1081

1085
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,390
a business so I'll contextualize it

1086
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:49,000
messes but most of my advice if it's

1087
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,270
human like you know and that's you know

1088
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:53,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">you just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to know how to be a pro</font>

1089
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:56,140
you act the same way in a funeral<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you</font>

1090
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,880
do in a business fetal as you do in las

1091
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,770
vegas even though all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

1092
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:02,890
the same you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have respect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> context it is</font>

1093
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:06,180

delay in wouldn't what are your

1116
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:53,670
strategies are nuances for when offline

1117
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,380
in a relationship do you say they know

1118
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,490

<font color="#CCCCCC">life line like I think it's one insane</font>

1123
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:09,420
look you know they're saying three

1124
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,610
questions I don't world here you slept

1125
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:13,950
out like let's do nine right it's always

1126
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:16,620
happening you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen there were</font>

1127
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,840
times that it's appropriate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and</font>

1128
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,570
ask right away it happens I hate it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1129
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,150
hate when there's a moment where

1130
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,260
something happens where I<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel it's</font>

1131
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,430
appropriate<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me to ask right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font>

1132
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,200
because I've given<font color="#CCCCCC"> up my leverage</font>

1133
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,750
whoever asks first is in second place

1134
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:43,850
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I truly believe that I do believe</font>

1135
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:45,890
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a by asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first I've lost leverage</font>

1136
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:48,440
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the relationship I feel like whether</font>

1137
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">I subconsciously maybe because I'm old</font>

1138
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,940
school but immediately I feel like I

1139
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,520
mean a few times<font color="#E5E5E5"> it happens I like so</font>

1140
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,500
panicky I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> over-delivering for that</font>

1141
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,510
person like TEDx right like I'm just

1142
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:01,610
doing jump to share<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go like it's just</font>

1143
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's so difficult for me to go there</font>

1144
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:05,150
that's why natural demeanor that is not

1145
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:06,860
everybody's natural demeanor that's not

1146
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,420
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> by default everybody's demeanor is</font>

1147
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:12,500
the other way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I get it listen every</font>

1148
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,810
day that I'm more successful it's easier

1149
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:18,590
for me to be patient right I get it I'm

1150
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:20,870
not naive but even when I wasn't this

1151
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:23,270
was my game because I know the game is

1152
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:26,270
wrong i'm not patient because i can

1153
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,610
afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be impatient because the game</font>

1154
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:30,680
is played a lot longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> than we think</font>

1155
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,000
about it you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

1156
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,130
professional you're gonna be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a human</font>

1157
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:37,340
being for the bigger hole lobby right

1158
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,620
like everybody in this room except for a

1159
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,910
couple of youngsters in the ground are

1160
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:43,730
on the clock right now until it's over

1161
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:47,900
so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's a lot</font>

1162
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">of ways to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provide value you know it's</font>

1163
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just about buying and selling you</font>

1164
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:53,420
know one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> though you people that</font>

1165
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,770
are doing the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they collect</font>

1166
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,750
people and they do a lot of matchmaking

1167
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,180
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a lot of you can do that</font>

1168
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:01,100
poorly they're literally collecting

1169
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:01,609
people

1170
00:48:01,609 --> 00:48:04,339
to do matchmaking for the sake of having

1171
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,890
that leverage I think we can smell that

1172
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:08,779
and I think that one thing I can leave

1173
00:48:08,779 --> 00:48:11,739
you with is please remember that intent

1174
00:48:11,739 --> 00:48:15,410
deeply matters your intentions is

1175
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:17,509
something we can actually feel it's how

1176
00:48:17,509 --> 00:48:19,670
humans are out of the bullshit radars

1177
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:21,049
are much better<font color="#CCCCCC"> than we give each other</font>

1178
00:48:21,049 --> 00:48:22,880
credit for I think the reason for me

1179
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,349
it's always worth is my intent is pure

1180
00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:27,230
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> just as I give and the selecting</font>

1181
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:28,970
people get confused<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Times that</font>

1182
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:31,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">a huge profile me in October about me in</font>

1183
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:33,680
this book and I think they took a little

1184
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,420
bit of a cynical shot at thing because

1185
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,249
in one part they were like everything

1186
00:48:37,249 --> 00:48:39,470
Aaron does is with the intent to sell

1187
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:41,059
them on something eventually I was like

1188
00:48:41,059 --> 00:48:42,769
that's a really sad way to look at it

1189
00:48:42,769 --> 00:48:45,470
here's how I look at it I give I did

1190
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:48,109
that interview I do this tonight I give

1191
00:48:48,109 --> 00:48:49,910
I meet with people talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to</font>

1192
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:52,999
football<font color="#E5E5E5"> players friend movie I give</font>

1193
00:48:52,999 --> 00:48:56,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it enables me to have the</font>

1194
00:48:56,499 --> 00:49:01,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity to maybe ass I'm not</font>

1195
00:49:01,339 --> 00:49:04,220
entitled I don't just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like gate doesn't</font>

1196
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:07,160
mean now you know I can't because I

1197
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,470
don't know I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna go really real with</font>

1198
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:13,099
you the reason i did is so insane it's

1199
00:49:13,099 --> 00:49:14,299
gonna make some of your head spin right

1200
00:49:14,299 --> 00:49:16,160
now here's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> i love to get more than</font>

1201
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:21,349
anything else I give for two for one

1202
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:23,450
major reason first of all let me say

1203
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:25,489
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't need any of you I don't</font>

1204
00:49:25,489 --> 00:49:27,529
talk about the camera I'm gonna get my

1205
00:49:27,529 --> 00:49:30,410
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that good okay so I'm not doing</font>

1206
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:32,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">it because I need to get something I'm</font>

1207
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:34,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing it for such a crazy reason the</font>

1208
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,710
reason I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give so much is in case</font>

1209
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:40,579
something insane happens and what I mean

1210
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:44,839
insane I mean like<font color="#CCCCCC"> world war three the</font>

1211
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:46,940
reason i like to give is me as if i give

1212
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,579
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm fucking bomb blows up half of</font>

00:49:49,579 --> 00:49:51,499
America me my finger the west coast and

1214
00:49:51,499 --> 00:49:52,580

00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:56,950
one of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really hope that I gave</font>

1216
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,650
or get a more real way that I'm very

1217

1219
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:12,660
the one thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need the most about</font>

1220
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,069
traveling so much is when other people

1221
00:50:14,069 --> 00:50:15,480
are driving I don't like not being the

1222
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,309
controlling that you know I was and

1223
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:18,569
these letters look at the phone the

1224
00:50:18,569 --> 00:50:23,970
whole time look at the road you know you

1227
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,150
daughter you know like one of me listing

1232
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:38,640
but that's what I like giving because

1233
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,049
it's gives me peace to know that I've

1234

1238
00:50:48,089 --> 00:50:50,309

1262
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:57,460

1263
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:00,220
on how do you evaluate talent and how do

1264
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,930
you bring the right people on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Teen</font>

1265
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:03,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">Belgrade people like when you're going</font>

1266
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:07,240
through old sales when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 16 that</font>

1267
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,960
sets up this guy was an idiot he was

1268
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,269
pretty bad human being and I basically

1269
00:52:13,269 --> 00:52:16,450
dislike him but he said one thing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

1270
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,339
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was 16 he loved</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

1271

<font color="#E5E5E5">carrying a case of absolut vodka 1.75 to</font>

1272
00:52:21,849 --> 00:52:24,160
the winter session and stopping the

1273
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,880
wheel Old scummy you but he saw me and

1274
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,039
we had a little talk and he said

1275
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:31,059
something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be that I'll never forget</font>

1276
00:52:31,059 --> 00:52:33,369
and I translated it into my own versions

1277
00:52:33,369 --> 00:52:36,150
the answer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your question he said Gary</font>

1278
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:38,799
he goes you don't know what you have

1279
00:52:38,799 --> 00:52:41,259
until you sleep with it that's the kind

1280
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:43,490
of duty

1281
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:45,590
and that's answered your question the

1282
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:48,770
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got him in talent is I try my best</font>

1283
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:52,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">to intuitively feel like yeah she's got</font>

1284
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">it like let's give her a shot but the</font>

1285
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">truth is until she walks in and actually</font>

1286
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:58,940
huge for 30 days I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know and</font>

1287
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,920
you read you know pretty quickly once

1288
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,100
they're in but evaluating Italian talent

1289
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,250
up front is very difficult like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel</font>

1290
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,990
like I have the best people skills ever

1291
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:11,330
I can feel that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been wrong and so</font>

1292
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:13,070
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> people fit into this notion of</font>

1293
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:16,160
try your best it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about hiring it's</font>

1294
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,400
about firing that's the key it's not

1295
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">about who you let in it's how you get</font>

1296
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,840
them out if they're not right that's the

1297
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,520
skill that we shall be<font color="#E5E5E5"> focusing on</font>

1298
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,710
because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to miss too many in</font>

1299
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:31,280
the upfront and so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how I</font>

1300
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,440
do it I you know I'm an optimist I'm a

1301
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,020
half last full guide like nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants</font>

1302
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,550
to be interviewing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a video via because</font>

1303
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:39,290
people walk in they be no skills on me

1304
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:42,290
but I feel it this kid's got it pretty

1305
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:44,800
tight

1306
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:47,860
no chump like Wall Street is going to be

1307
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:50,530
a ninja like I'm bad everyone I think

1308
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:52,180
everybody can do it so they kind of

1309
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,550
tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take me out of the equation of</font>

1310
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,830
hiring and Boehner but that I always

1312
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:07,840

<font color="#E5E5E5">brightening well actually a thing it's</font>

1669
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,850
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here representing the company</font>

1670
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:33,620
want to also in a larger my own personal

1671
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:35,450
pressure but again i'm representing is

1672
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:37,310
as well to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a trick i'm just not</font>

1673
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:38,689
sure out a<font color="#E5E5E5"> breakthrough that without</font>

1674
01:08:38,689 --> 01:08:40,009
doing this respect to the company that's

1675
01:08:40,009 --> 01:08:44,569
a really good question you know I'm

1676
01:08:44,569 --> 01:08:46,250
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> struggling right now in vaynor</font>

1677
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,430
because a lot of my employees

1678
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:50,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">has to be on this panel can I speak and</font>

1679
01:08:50,439 --> 01:08:53,470
I'm saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> no and I'm super scared if</font>

1680
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:54,819
they think that I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to suppress</font>

1681
01:08:54,819 --> 01:08:56,140
them so they can't build<font color="#E5E5E5"> up their game</font>

1682
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:58,180
the reason I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that I don't feel</font>

1683
01:08:58,180 --> 01:08:59,740
confident that everybody in my

1684
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:01,930
organization has their POV down on

1685
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:03,670
everything if they're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage and say</font>

1686
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:06,490
yes that's bad that automatically even

1687
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:08,350
if it's Carol or Susie or Tommy and

1688
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:10,420
Johnny that reflects on me and I can't

1689
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:12,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">have anything be wrong now go that way</font>

1690
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,550
we're trying to roll right yeah I get it

1691
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:17,560
man it's really really tough it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1692
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,600
tough I let<font color="#CCCCCC"> my employees do whatever I</font>

1693
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,069
want them to all be bigger than me and

1694
01:09:21,069 --> 01:09:22,149
what have you because I believe in

1695
01:09:22,149 --> 01:09:24,279
capitalism you know suppressing people

1696
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:25,510
from not being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do their thing</font>

1697
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:27,700
that's communism I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that it's</font>

1698
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:30,580
bad so you know I think the number one

1699
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:32,290
way to fix every issue in the world is

1700
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:33,790
communication if this is something

1701
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:35,560
that's deep in your heart I would go and

1702
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,180
have a talk with your CEO really listen

1703
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:38,979
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put out videos I want to do</font>

1704
01:09:38,979 --> 01:09:42,310
blocks I'm aware that that sets us area

1705
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:44,710
where I may get recruited but for the

1706
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:46,240
time being I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's also going to</font>

1707
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:49,390
bring it a lot of business for you maybe

1708
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:51,069
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does you can do better for me</font>

1709
01:09:51,069 --> 01:09:52,779
maybe you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you feel</font>

1710
01:09:52,779 --> 01:09:55,090
we love this view the student ID<font color="#CCCCCC"> rather</font>

1711
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:57,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">feel like maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd say don't listen I</font>

1712
01:09:57,070 --> 01:09:58,630
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just be the best shot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't so</font>

1713
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:00,070
if I can be your right-hand man I don't

1714
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:01,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">want my own agency</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want to work</font>

1715
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:04,480
anywhere else I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that listen</font>

1716
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,700
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an answer for everybody there's</font>

1717
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:07,930
something weirds been going on this

1718
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:09,880
finale a lot in my life lately I've

1719
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,500
always been a big proponent of over

1720
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,970
communicating has been some really

1721
01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:13,480
highly

1722
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:15,280
sensitive issues for employees with

1723
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,989
family my own family where I've been

1724
01:10:16,989 --> 01:10:19,180
pushing this it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just stunning it</font>

1725
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:21,820
always works<font color="#E5E5E5"> either you're going to</font>

1726
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:23,890
speed on the bad thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> or it's going to</font>

1727
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:27,040
make it way better and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

1728
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,450
you this is a real day in your heart you

1729
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:37,420
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have talked thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here yeah</font>

1730
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:39,460
so I'm Mike ambassador bringing and i'm

1731
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:41,710
working on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> start-up all brand inside</font>

1732
01:10:41,710 --> 01:10:43,989
of a brand brand inside already so

1733
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:45,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what I'm looking to do is get</font>

1734
01:10:45,489 --> 01:10:48,790
the last one was that interesting

1735
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:50,680
because basically what I'm looking to do

1736
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,350
is connect take companies and help them

1737
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:55,390
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn their actual employees until</font>

1738
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:57,370
marketing arm for them you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

1739
01:10:57,370 --> 01:11:00,550
very big human right on people to space

1740
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:02,260
right now and that's where I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1741
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:03,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">connect the question for you is is</font>

1742
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:06,400
connecting to Colorado yes employee

1743
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,340
advocacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> is social</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did you um</font>

1744
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:11,140
dynamic signal that's right so some of

1745
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:13,810
those folks which in those cases a lot

1746
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:15,700
of times they provide a platform but as

1747
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:18,040
I say the strategy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey company let</font>

1748
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,450
me take you through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the steps of how you</font>

1749
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:21,370
actually wanna do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1750
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:22,870
vaynermedia version you want to the

1751
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:24,880
product<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to do that is something</font>

1752
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">abstract yes and the number one that you</font>

1753
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,560
should do is reach out to some<font color="#CCCCCC"> chorus</font>

1754
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,690
and now you're the signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> demarcus stuff</font>

1755
01:11:31,690 --> 01:11:33,580
so my boys don't want to all these

1756
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,650
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ask them how do you feel</font>

1757
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:37,360
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> calling to</font>

1758
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,460
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> no our account people are doing that</font>

1759
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:41,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it'd be interesting for me to see</font>

1760
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:43,510
how they would respond to that because

1761
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:45,400
they may actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support you</font>

1762
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,470
because you be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> third party not just</font>

1763
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:52,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">them and that would rise all ships yeah</font>

1764
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:54,230
what I look at this

1765
01:11:54,230 --> 01:11:56,910
as I was actually that employee I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1766
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:58,860
disgruntled employee who became a brand

1767
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,360
ambassador and that changed everything

1768
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,610
sure and then I started working on

1769
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:04,860
revamping the program like that totally

1770
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:07,230
tell you guys something in here the

1771
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:08,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">number one day I don't even want</font>

1772
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:10,470
anything people<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of business is to</font>

1773
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:13,290
scratch your own inch so right here<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1774
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:14,760
say that that already need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1775
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,560
dramatically more confidence because you

1776
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,330
scratched your own edge let it live it

1777
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:21,170
number two I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would highly recommend</font>

1778
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,310
blocking and putting on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of content</font>

1779
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:25,320
the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> mistake people have with a</font>

1780
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,420
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> soul forgive you and stuff is</font>

1781
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:29,970
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that their IP their ideas is</font>

1782
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:31,890
what they are selling rate holding<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1783
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:34,920
think go to the other way I buddy I'm

1784
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:38,400
vaynermedia<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's gotten 20 to 300</font>

1785
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,200
employees pretty much predicated on

1786
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,820
strategy and I put out of twenty

1787
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:44,280
thousand bucks right like like I just

1788
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">put it out there i think one thing you</font>

1789
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:47,370
