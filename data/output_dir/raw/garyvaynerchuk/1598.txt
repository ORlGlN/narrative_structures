Liz<font color="#CCCCCC"> EV who allowed me to do this not</font>

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,260
only that kind of pushed<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she</font>

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,150
believed in this thought and I thought

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,350
it was exciting I just twittered

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,060
something out and that's where I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,410
with this which is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big debate that</font>

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,939
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to raise right now and I'm</font>

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking a lot of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is that is</font>

12
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,769
Twitter quickly stealing an enormous

13
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,110
amount of Facebook and at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

14
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,780
day a better and bigger app<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,910
that people would find preposterous is

16
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,850
now starting to look very real to me the

17
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,460
quickness of twitter is such a factor

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,500
the instant gratification the world is

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,539
moving so quickly that the fact that we

20
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,820
can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that response so quickly look</font>

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,670
look AOL<font color="#CCCCCC"> Instant Messenger still around</font>

22
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,750
and strong right so is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter taking a</font>

23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,460
lot from facebook i noticed a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">people I kind of asked you know is that</font>

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,309
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case for you and a lot of people</font>

26
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:06,299
saying yes a lot now why is this now

27
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,890
some people are saying you know no

28
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,930
zombie invites in all the distracting

29
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,080
situations a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people saying</font>

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">facebook seems real slow to them right</font>

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,759
now now before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get completely</font>

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:18,900
ridiculous before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I make this</font>

33
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,770
preposterous statement let's be honest

34
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,920
facebook has feeds<font color="#E5E5E5"> right they've got a</font>

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,170
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money right they've got a big</font>

36
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,689
noxious talent big<font color="#E5E5E5"> shout out to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dave</font>

37
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">Morin follow him at at dave morin on</font>

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,409
twitter um they need to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

39
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,770
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make their feed Mick mechanism a</font>

40
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter club you know like flat out they</font>

41
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,479
need to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to make their</font>

42
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,140
feed situation a subset<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Facebook some</font>

43
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,420
that's quicker better more instantaneous

44
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,930
and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be adding each other on</font>

45
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook or I think Twitter and things</font>

46
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,759
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter are really going to start</font>

47
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,950
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and more and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

48
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,869
market<font color="#CCCCCC"> share as mobile becomes far more</font>

49
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,119
important simplicity is going to be

50
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,008
important and I think the simplicity of

51
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,538
Twitter's mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> application is is</font>

52
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,569
dominant I don't know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really you</font>

53
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:13,510
know just kind of hit

54
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,180
as I was dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it once you get on</font>

55
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">that speed of what Twitter does and that</font>

56
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,620
allows you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> interact quickly and more</font>

57
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,510
efficiently and that's really what we

58
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,610
want I mean we love to play Scrabble and

59
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,230
there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we like to do</font>

60
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,640
and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely that place to go</font>

61
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,319
but that's kind of like going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

62
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,090
vacation do you understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

63
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying we spend a little bit more money</font>

64
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:34,720
on our house than we do in our vacations

65
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,370
so it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing time where</font>

66
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,650
things seem and can come from anywhere

67
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,450
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in others were off the big high of</font>

68
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">South by in Twitter always gets a big</font>

69
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,620
push from there but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> as Twitter</font>

70
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,209
starts getting into mainstream world

71
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,099
because don't get it twisted nobody

72
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:53,769
knows what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter is we do you're</font>

73
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:55,750
watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now you do but most</font>

74
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,269
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't as it starts seeping into</font>

75
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:00,940
mainstream I think we want to see a real

76
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">opportunity for this app to have far</font>

77
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:04,989
more potential pickups to AB I mean him

78
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:07,030
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> his crew those guys are killing it</font>

79
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,099
every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it feels like even oh do what</font>

80
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:10,540
they saw before come on let's be honest

81
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,920
they killed it so my question I'm asking

82
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,970
you tonight is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter or something</font>

83
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,709
like Twitter over next five or<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten years</font>

84
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:23,709
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's being ridiculous over next 24</font>

85
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:27,190
to 36 months have more upside and more

86
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,169
importantly are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

87
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:31,889
fully expect facebook to adjust to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

88
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:34,060
changing scenario because it's always

89
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,169
changing changing scenario and adjusting

90
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:40,989
their feed mechanism to look and act and

91
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:44,250
feel a lot more like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter</font>

92
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,440
experience see you later<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna kick</font>
