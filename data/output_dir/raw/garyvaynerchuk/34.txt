1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,147
- This is Agent 2021!

2
00:00:02,147 --> 00:00:04,814
(serious music)

3
00:00:08,914 --> 00:00:11,414
(funky music)

4
00:00:21,684 --> 00:00:24,351
(serious music)

5
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,350
So I'm super excited like
obviously I do this a ton

6
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,470
but it's never been my party
right, I've just been a guest.

7
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,810
The maybe the guest of
honor, but always just guest,

8
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,290
and so to be the host,
and Kim is crushing it,

9
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,460
and the venue's insane,
hopefully you or Derock

10
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,780
or somebody will get
some sort of crazy angle

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,610
from up top, like it's
pretty fucking legit.

12
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,530
And everything is perfect.

13
00:01:04,074 --> 00:01:06,640
And just cause I love
Steve Ross I will not razz

14
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,510
on the dolphins part of it all,

15
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,570
the irony of it all, but super excited.

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,410
- [Loudspeaker] Ladies and
gentlemen, please welcome

17
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,308
to the stage, the CEO of
VaynerX, Gary Vaynerchuk.

18
00:01:16,308 --> 00:01:19,308
(audience cheering)

19
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:23,490
- You know, when I came up
with the concept of the name,

20
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,530
I thought it was interesting

21
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,130
to create a conference
that actually expires.

22
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:32,130
We, our ambition is to create
this brand, Agent 2021,

23
00:01:32,612 --> 00:01:35,240
for people that we have as
agents, you know obviously

24
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,900
we pick the four sectors,
industries, that I think

25
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,290
what I'm about to keynote
about really matter,

26
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,040
the timing around my
new book, Crushing It,

27
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,220
and this talk, is very important,
because what is stunning

28
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,520
to me is how much opportunity
there is for everybody

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,380
at this conference, what
I think is super important

30
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,380
to really attack this
morning is I truly believe

31
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,310
that most of you don't understand
how big the stakes are,

32
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,820
because you get caught,
the way I get caught.

33
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,080
I don't believe that most of
us understand how early it is,

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,240
and I'm worried that you
haven't gone deep enough

35
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,090
while you're thinking about going wider.

36
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,960
You're doing well on
Facebook ads, or Google ads,

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,310
but you're leaving so
much more on the table.

38
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,920
I notice, because even I'm doing that.

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,070
If I can give you the
biggest pieces of advice,

40
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,210
that would be blanket,
that I know everybody could

41
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,430
be affected by, whether you
have a restaurant, or did,

42
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,290
whether you have a liquor
store, or did, whether you're

43
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,260
in the real estate business,
insurance, I know for fact,

44
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,530
for fact that you could
four to fifty times X,

45
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,420
your investment in both creative,
the pictures, the videos,

46
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,480
the written words, and in actually

47
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,020
spending the ads, to get far more.

48
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,520
The fact that you're
spending, and it's working,

49
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,540
is hiding the fact that there's
a lot more underneath that,

50
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,920
and I would really really really

51
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,240
take advantage of this morning

52
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,040
to set up, to set up the mindset,
for you to realize there's

53
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,800
probably a lot more going on in the depth,

54
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,870
then there is in the width.

55
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,660
Before you get get inspired,
to start your show,

56
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,910
your podcast, your Alexa
skill, what's going on

57
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,480
with Vine 2 when it comes
out, before you do that,

58
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,070
which you should, but I
feel like for most of us,

59
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:28,540
including myself, that
should be 20% of our energy

60
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,540
and mind, and 80% should
be looking very carefully

61
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,870
at what's working, and getting
far more committed to it.

62
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,880
This moment, right now, this
is how it's going to play out.

63
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,340
And I'm putting it on film,
and I'll look back at it.

64
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,700
This is the land grab of the Internet.

65
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,480
This is the land grab
to establish yourself

66
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,710
as the personality, the
authority, the organization,

67
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,360
the service in your industry,
still, you can have four

68
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,580
competitors who've got
more followers than you,

69
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,380
you can have people you look
up to that have crushed it,

70
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,180
and things of that nature that
will speak today, but still,

71
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,370
we haven't even come close,
so what does this all mean.

72
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,930
Here's how I think this plays out.

73
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,700
I genuinely believe that
80% and that includes people

74
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,430
that are more shy and
scared to be on camera,

75
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,130
and are introverted, I believe
that 80% of this audience,

76
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,730
over the next half-decade,
is gonna start debating

77
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,080
having a Derock, and an IRS, and a baben.

78
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,400
I think all of you over the
next decade will realize

79
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,610
that you are in the media
business, that before that you are

80
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,170
any kind of agent, you are
actually a show, that the shit

81
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,510
that you watch on Bravo
and HGTV and all the other

82
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,030
fucking channels, you
can do the same thing,

83
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,020
outside of the guy we
have here on his show

84
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,960
and about three other
shows, nobody really watches

85
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,200
any of these cable shows.

86
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,400
Literally the biggest thing
that's holding back the far

87
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,090
majority in this room, from
going into a completely

88
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,250
different level, financially,
and happywise, is the fact

89
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,330
that every year they're
just taking home too much

90
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,970
of the money they made,
and they're buying cars

91
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,530
and vacations and homes and
fucking bullshit jewelry.

92
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,800
If you're making money right
now, please re-invest it.

93
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,520
In the one thing that
doesn't get shattered during

94
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,150
a bad economy, which is your reputation.

95
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,430
I can't thank you enough for being here,

96
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,130
I am so excited about
Agent 2021, I am so humbled

97
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,860
that you guys are here, I
adore you, and I'm really

98
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,960
looking forward to seeing you guys

99
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,010
throughout the rest of the day.

100
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:27,870
Thank you.

101
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,302
(audience cheers)

102
00:05:30,302 --> 00:05:31,135
- [Audience Member] Thank you for that.

103
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:33,160
That was like a game changer.

104
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,993
- Listen.

105
00:05:33,993 --> 00:05:35,870
It's the point of this whole talk.

106
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,030
Like honestly while I've
got a lot of you listening,

107
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,360
cause it's a different feeling
then onstage, listen to me.

108
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,310
Nobody here is spending enough
money or time on this thing.

109
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,223
Nobody.

110
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:48,540
If I'm not, you're not even fucking close.

111
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,373
Nobody.

112
00:05:49,373 --> 00:05:52,150
There's so much for you to take and I

113
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,800
just think everybody's checking the box.

114
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,550
You feel good that
you're on it, when you're

115
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,200
with your other friends,
because, you justify things like

116
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,840
I have 4,000 followers on
Instagram, it means dick.

117
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,160
Like you have to go all in.

118
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,690
This is like, rough.

119
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,500
I can feel the regret
building in my own body,

120
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,430
and I'm like literally
the leader of the whole

121
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,120
fucking thing, so where the fuck are you.

122
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,290
Please, please understand how big this is.

123
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,925
Yeah show a lot of different
tones, they've loved,

124
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:19,560
just kind of talk to
everybody like I'm talking

125
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,150
to like one person, a lot of
times I'm in showman mode,

126
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,070
I went way more mellow,
just like, plead, I was like

127
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,510
almost pleading, like right?

128
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,010
It was like a plea.

129
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,320
And it's a plea to all of
you, like please understand

130
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,230
how great this era is,

131
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:37,230
we're just not going hard
enough, fuck, think about it.

132
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,850
It's the Internet my friends,
it's the fucking Internet.

133
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,920
It's not him, or me, it's the Internet.

134
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,100
It eliminates everything
that has commodity.

135
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,130
This is about the fucking
Internet, and it can fucking

136
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,450
break your face unless you
ride the wave, because too many

137
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,520
of you are looking at
the wave coming at you,

138
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,600
and you think you're somebody
because you've had some

139
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,900
success, this thing is
gonna fucking kill you.

140
00:07:02,018 --> 00:07:02,851
- Amen.

141
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:09,660
- I, I really am concerned
that people think that they're

142
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,820
doing social media and
marketing and building their

143
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,260
personal brand, and I think
that, that concerns me,

144
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,950
because I think there's
so much left to be had,

145
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,810
I think good enough is is just
a bad idea, oh it's because

146
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,180
you're not pushing yourself
and taking it there,

147
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,430
I think what I'm even
specifically focused on right now,

148
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,600
is there is underpriced
attention on social media,

149
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,000
that can be leveraged for your
success, for your happiness,

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,300
and so what I was kind of
ranting at, since the people

151
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,340
that came to this conference
are a little bit more educated,

152
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,560
is hey, I know that you have
an Instagram and a Facebook

153
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,730
account, I know you're
running some of these ads,

154
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,580
you're doing Google, you're getting it,

155
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,760
but let's gear it up deeper.

156
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,890
Let's do more Facebook
ads, let's do a podcast,

157
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,670
let's get serious, cause
the land grab is real.

158
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,970
And the tough thing about real estate is,

159
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,910
you don't know who's in the market.

160
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,810
So you need brand awareness.

161
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,230
You are trading on brand.

162
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,670
That is what Re/Max and fuckin',

163
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,620
you know, and all the, it's brand.

164
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,050
When, Ryan was like,
they're not gonna matter,

165
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,470
like brand always matters.

166
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,940
Brand always matters.

167
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,020
So, it's good to own it, not rent it.

168
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,770
Every one of you is
wearing something right now

169
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,130
far more likely because of the brand,

170
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,520
not because of the sales.

171
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,770
I don't think you walk
into a store and got sold

172
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,672
those sneakers, you know, you
were like, you knew, brand.

173
00:08:22,672 --> 00:08:23,660
Brand.

174
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,493
Brand.

175
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:25,326
- [Audience Member] Like
the Cheese Swizzles?

176
00:08:25,326 --> 00:08:26,159
- What's that?

177
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:26,992
- [Audience Member] The Cheese Swizzles?

178
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:28,340
- That's exactly right.

179
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,880
- [Audience Member] How come
you didn't give us all a pair?

180
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,572
- Because they're sold the fuck out.

181
00:08:31,572 --> 00:08:34,409
(audience laughing)

182
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,242
- Anyway, gotta go.

183
00:08:35,243 --> 00:08:36,076
Let's go.

184
00:08:36,076 --> 00:08:36,909
- [Audience Member] Hey
it's Andy Ria Facebook live.

185
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:37,741
- Live, what up.

186
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:38,574
Love you guys see ya.

187
00:08:38,575 --> 00:08:39,408
All right bye guys.

188
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:40,275
See you soon.

189
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:41,449
Thank you, thank you
man, thank you brother.

190
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,539
- What's your overall message.

191
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,259
Not just today, but when you --

192
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,324
- Macro?

193
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,157
- Yeah.

194
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:49,430
- 400 trillion to one,
was my overall message.

195
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,250
I just can't believe that
I'm looking right at you,

196
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,240
camera, that we don't take advantage

197
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,720
of the fact that we're people.

198
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,810
It's 400 trillion to one
to even become a person.

199
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,690
My overall message is to squeeze

200
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,300
this thing for all it's got,

201
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,840
and hey the Internet, has
come along, and for everybody

202
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,090
who's sitting and watching this right now,

203
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,380
and who's in a job that they
hate, the fact that they

204
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,830
can still pay their mortgage,
their college loans,

205
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,420
or their kids' schools,
but then from 7:00 PM

206
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,260
to two in the morning,
sell stuff on Ebay, start

207
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,010
a vlog, start a podcast, this is real.

208
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,770
This is very real.

209
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,220
People are gonna say, oh, ah.

210
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,053
It's real.

211
00:09:24,053 --> 00:09:26,410
I came from nothing,
and millions of people

212
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,590
have come from nothing on
the back of the Internet.

213
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,910
- Loaded question.

214
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,240
What is the truth about
college for children.

215
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,290
- Are you gonna pay for his college?

216
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,150
- Yes I am.

217
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,120
- Well then take your
four year vacation bro.

218
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,120
(audience laughing)

219
00:09:43,712 --> 00:09:44,545
- Just kidding.

220
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:48,960
- I mean, look, look, I think,
look, the, college thing

221
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,390
is very very very difficult for me.

222
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,070
I wish I actually was a great student.

223
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,240
I wish I went to Harvard.

224
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,860
Because I think I could
impact more people.

225
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,520
I think most people think
my point on view on college

226
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,790
is because I was a shit student

227
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,540
and went to a shit college
and became successful.

228
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:07,340
My point of view on college
is based on unemotional math.

229
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,630
The math is broken.

230
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,500
We went through a 50, 60 year period

231
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,900
where going to college was ROI positive.

232
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,090
If you went to college
and got a piece of paper,

233
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,950
you would then be able to get
the return on that investment

234
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,810
because that's how the world worked,

235
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,550
and we were in the era of
corporations having the control.

236
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,950
That's not exist.

237
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,300
Do you need, do you need a
degree for certain professions?

238
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,320
If you want to be a doctor,
lawyer, I understand all that.

239
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,320
But, college is, will he become
a well-rounded young man,

240
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,330
and like all the social
things, let him go tour

241
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,390
fucking Europe for three
months, he'll be way more

242
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,500
well-rounded and worldly
than sitting in a fucking

243
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,550
dorm room playing fucking Call of Duty.

244
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,041
- Well you just wanna warn us.

245
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:49,874
Thank you Gary.

246
00:10:49,874 --> 00:10:50,870
- You're welcome.

247
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,240
Love you guys see ya!

248
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,840
Like literally for the
last, probably year now,

249
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,640
I'd say, I've been
dreaming about this call,

250
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,340
there's not been anything that
is gonna disrupt marketing

251
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,210
to the level of that voices, since social,

252
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,830
and so I'm just excited to
be at the forefront of it.

253
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,280
- Where'd this whole idea
come about, Agent 2021.

254
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,113
I heard there was --

255
00:11:10,113 --> 00:11:10,960
- You're gonna love this.

256
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,793
- Kay.

257
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:12,640
- Agent 2021.

258
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,473
- Yes.

259
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,470
I recap this nation event.

260
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,710
- Here's what I can tell.

261
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,130
It's going well.

262
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,950
We're in the middle of it right now,

263
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,350
for a first-time event, it's grand, right,

264
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,230
it's like a stadium, like, I think my team

265
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,460
did an incredible job,
I'm sure we'll recap

266
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,010
some of the strengths,
some of the weaknesses,

267
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,570
here's what I can tell you.

268
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:36,240
The 2019 version of this event,
is gonna be pretty gangster.

269
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,630
- Typical advice to all
this audience that would

270
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,960
you know like to see you
in like role model stuff.

271
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,840
- Patience.

272
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,750
Fucking patience.

273
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,740
Patience and self-esteem.

274
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,050
That's what I give a shit about.

275
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,163
I guess my punch line is,

276
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:50,996
- Yes.

277
00:11:50,996 --> 00:11:51,829
- This next generation,

278
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:55,770
is gonna destroy, destroy 40 to 50%

279
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,010
of the establishment,
because that establishment

280
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,560
didn't know how to speak to that.

281
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,970
But now these kids live
100% on their phone,

282
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,250
which means that if
you're not in Instagram

283
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,250
and Snapchat, you don't exist.

284
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,630
Brands that are growing
at an extreme rapid rate,

285
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,720
are spending on Facebook and Instagram,

286
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,790
and brands that are declining
at an extreme rapid rate,

287
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,480
are disproportionately
spending money on television.

288
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,560
There's nothing else to say.

289
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,511
That's data.

290
00:12:20,511 --> 00:12:23,320
It's just about perspective on this shit.

291
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,528
You have no choice.

292
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:26,800
- Yeah.

293
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,633
No absolutely.

294
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:30,480
- What, you gonna dwell
about 2000 fucking eight?

295
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,510
For how long?

296
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,690
You won't get your shit
together unless you understand

297
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,270
what the fuck is actually happening here.

298
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,040
And what's actually happening
here, is we're looking

299
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,680
through the greatest
fucking time of all time,

300
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,350
because we are fucking
live on video on Facebook.

301
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,810
Do you guys understand how
ridiculous the opportunity is?

302
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:46,990
Please take advantage of it.

303
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,080
So many people wasting the opportunity.

304
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,620
Because it takes a little success,

305
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,600
and you're not really fucking squeezing.

306
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,260
My whole keynote this morning
was a weird vibe, I was like,

307
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,250
we're not fucking squeezing it enough.

308
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,504
Fucking squeeze it Canada!

309
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:03,337
(excited chatter)

310
00:13:08,893 --> 00:13:11,090
- So I feel like the cooler
thing for me to see throughout

311
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,610
the day was like, that,
created this, and it

312
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,120
got people here, but
the value that they got

313
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,140
out of what we provided,
and then they left

314
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,973
and they were like --

315
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:21,720
- What you guys, the core of
what people felt about what

316
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,400
you guys did, and then what our
employees did, it was great.

317
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,233
All right.

318
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:27,092
Thank you guys.

319
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:27,925
Bye.

320
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:30,508
(mellow music)

321
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,878
- Just another day at the office.

322
00:13:37,878 --> 00:13:40,461
(mellow music)

323
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:11,140
(turn signal ticking)

324
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,010
- My why is really like, gratitude.

325
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,720
Almost guilt.

326
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,340
I feel like I was gifted all this shit,

327
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,173
and I feel like --

328
00:14:27,173 --> 00:14:28,006
- [Friend] Gotta give back, right?

329
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:29,340
I, I get you.

330
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,300
- 100 percent.

331
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,150
- [Friend] Talk about what
gets you up, like every day.

332
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,030
- 100%.

333
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,863
Legacy.

334
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,641
So one thing I'm fascinated by
with realtors, is the recall.

335
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:46,570
If I told the three of you, four of you,

336
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,490
my favorite move, my favorite move,

337
00:14:49,526 --> 00:14:53,940
I think you guys sell
a home and you're out.

338
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,670
It's like you hooked up with
a pretty girl and you're out.

339
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,370
I think if you went and sent
someone a $200 gift basket,

340
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,630
18 months, not a year,
after you sold their home,

341
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,340
and said, hey, I was
thinking about you, so hoping

342
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,510
that you're in love with
the home as you were,

343
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,900
a year a half ago.

344
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,740
That's it.

345
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:17,640
They're gonna get that gift
basket and be like, the fuck?

346
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,780
And then, three weeks
later, their aunt's gonna

347
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,690
come over and say they're selling a home,

348
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,180
and they're gonna say,
you know you fucking have

349
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,972
to use, no, when I tell you
nobody does it, for real.

350
00:15:28,972 --> 00:15:31,972
(audience cheering)

351
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:34,550
- He still has a voice.

352
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,730
- I don't, I don't know
how much of a voice I have,

353
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,870
but I will say this.

354
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,630
First of all, I wanna
thank Tom for coming up,

355
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,020
Brian, I see you in the corner
there, you're hair's getting

356
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,190
a little puffier, which I like.

357
00:15:47,027 --> 00:15:47,860
It's the humidity!

358
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,940
I knew it!

359
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,070
I wanna thank you too bro,
and you're whole team,

360
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,170
I mean you're whole team's got great hair.

361
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:59,200
I, thank you guys all so much
for coming out, you know,

362
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,810
you guys being here has
given our team back home

363
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,410
an obnoxious amount of confidence.

364
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,650
And what we're gonna
do with this next year.

365
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,900
I wanna just thank
everybody for coming out,

366
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,060
I think there was a lot of value today,

367
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,220
most of all, I hope you heed
the content that you consumed,

368
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,070
there's a lot of winners in
this room, and I think winners

369
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,170
are the most vulnerable,
cause they're leaving a lot

370
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,710
on the table because they're
winning, and so I hope

371
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,683
that's the theme that a
lot of people left with.

372
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:27,540
But most of all, just thank you so much,

373
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,300
I wish you guys health,
because everything else

374
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,070
is controllable.

375
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,140
I love you more bro.

376
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,453
Thanks for being here.

377
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,286
And I hope you have a good night.

378
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,119
Take care.

379
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,952
Thanks, cheers!

380
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:41,403
- [Woman] Long day?

381
00:16:41,403 --> 00:16:42,407
- Long day.

382
00:16:42,407 --> 00:00:00,000
(mellow music)
