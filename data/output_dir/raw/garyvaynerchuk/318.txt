1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,201
- On this episode,

2
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:03,667
John Legend stops by.

3
00:00:03,667 --> 00:00:06,542
(hip hop music)

4
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:18,333
- [Gary] You ask questions

5
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:21,125
and I answer them.

6
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,875
This is

7
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:26,000
The #AskGaryVee Show.

8
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,165
- Hey everybody,
it's Gary Vay-ner-chuk

9
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,542
and this is episode 250

10
00:00:33,542 --> 00:00:37,333
of The #AskGaryVee Show.

11
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,041
Super excited,
250, nice round number.

12
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:43,959
Makes sense to have superstar
John Legend in the house.

13
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:45,458
DRock you're excited.

14
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:46,959
- [DRock] I am.
- Very excited.

15
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:49,000
Susan, thanks for
making this happen. John.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,166
- How are you, sir?
- It's a pleasure, man.

17
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,750
Why don't you say to the
zero people who don't know

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,834
who you are
(laughs)

19
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:56,125
right now a
little bit of who you are

20
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,083
and what you're up to.

21
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,708
We'll get into some call-in
and we'll jam a little bit.

22
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,875
- I'm just a kid from Ohio.

23
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,834
I like to make music.

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,166
I have a wonderful
wife named Chrissy Teigan.

25
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,291
My daughter's name is Luna

26
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:13,917
and I make music and
other art for a living.

27
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:16,333
That's pretty much what I do.
- I love the humble answer.

28
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,458
(laughs)
I know how you roll.

29
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,542
John, before we
get into the calls,

30
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:21,000
Facebook, where's Facebook?
Right there?

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,125
Facebook please
put your phone number.

32
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:27,750
Let's go with music or
entrepreneur or art questions

33
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,917
for John and I.

34
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:31,083
Please put your phone
number, we'll be calling you

35
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:34,333
in a second and you'll have a
chance to talk to the Legend.

36
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,708
John, because I know a
little bit of your backstory,

37
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:37,667
I think a lot of people do,

38
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:39,250
I think so many
people have been watching us,

39
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,291
been spending a lot of
time with emerging artists,

40
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:45,500
hip hop, all forms of
music over the last year

41
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,083
so on my platform.

42
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,959
One of the biggest reasons
that we talked about this

43
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,083
we were just jamming a
little bit with our friend

44
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:54,041
Robert Souza,
like Chance and others

45
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,583
direct to consumer--
- Yeah.

46
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,250
- you came up
during a different era.

47
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,625
- Yeah, I came up
in the era when people

48
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,834
needed a record deal--
- [Gary] How to get discovered.

49
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:03,250
- To get get discovered.

50
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,792
They needed a lot
of investment early on

51
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:09,792
not just in recording costs,
but in marketing costs

52
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:13,417
and physical products had
to be made to sell to people

53
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:15,375
and obviously things
have changed quite a bit now.

54
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,625
Very few people will
actually buy a CD anymore.

55
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,250
Very few people
will buy vinyl anymore.

56
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,208
And people are
getting their music digitally

57
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,583
and they're streaming.

58
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,750
There's a lot less
need for record labels now.

59
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,166
So, you see with artists
like Chance and Frank Ocean

60
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,792
and other artists,
people choosing to circumvent

61
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:37,083
the label and go
straight to the consumer.

62
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,166
- How does a guy like you
that sits at the tippy top

63
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:42,125
of the game?
I mean you really won.

64
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:45,542
You're in a different, aspiring
entrepreneurial musician

65
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:47,708
says, "Okay,
that's gonna be my path."

66
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,333
I've gotten to
know you a little bit.

67
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,625
Actually, I think
this is a fun fact.

68
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,417
We're in a building
here, we just moved in.

69
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:54,333
Boston Consulting
Group is in this building.

70
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,625
This is what you were doing.

71
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:56,834
- My first job
out of college was at

72
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:58,333
Boston Consulting Group.

73
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,250
- You know, a lot of
people know who you are,

74
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,542
but I'm not sure a lot of
people understand like kind of

75
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:05,875
the skills you have outside of

76
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:06,959
your music career.

77
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,208
You're a smart dude.

78
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,250
A great academic career,
which gives you the opportunity

79
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,500
working at BCG.

80
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,834
I know that you're smart
and savvy and business like

81
00:03:15,834 --> 00:03:17,291
not just the artist.

82
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,083
How do you think
about the changing landscape

83
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:23,083
where you have
golden handcuffs, right?

84
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,333
That's a way to look at it.

85
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,750
You have real economics,
whereas when you're starting

86
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,208
from zero going direct
to Instagram or Musical.ly

87
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,792
or uploading on SoundCloud or
Spotify is the only option,

88
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:34,125
the natural option...

89
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,125
You're in a very
different small group of people

90
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,625
looking at the landscape change.

91
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,000
- Well,

92
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,834
having success and
having an audience is always

93
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:43,500
gonna give you power.
- [Gary] Yes.

94
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,625
- Having an audience of,
you know, almost 10 million

95
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,208
followers on Twitter and, you
know, six or seven million

96
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,458
followers on Instagram.

97
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,208
That gives you an opportunity
to say no to whatever

98
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,208
you want to say no to and
say yes to what you want to

99
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,500
say yes to

100
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,250
and we all have choices.

101
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,083
And many of us are
still signed to record labels

102
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,583
because record labels
made us enough of an offer

103
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,583
to buy out...
- [Gary] The bank.

104
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:06,625
- Yeah (laughs).

105
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,291
So, they gave us enough
money for us to say, well,

106
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,959
it's worth staying in
with the record labels

107
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,500
and they do have some
expertise and some scale

108
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,625
when it comes to marketing
and some of the other things

109
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,208
that they do that it
still makes it beneficial

110
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,125
for us to work with them and
then you combine that with

111
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,834
the fact that they buy us out
and give us a good advance

112
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:28,667
and we say, well, here's
the economics of doing this

113
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:30,375
one way or
doing it the other way

114
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,125
and a lot of us have chosen
to stay with the record labels

115
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,000
because of.
- And to give you guys

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,250
context a lot of you
talk about self-publishing.

117
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,083
I was free agent,
six, seven months ago.

118
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,625
I know, DRock, you saw
a lot of this negotiation

119
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,208
that we never showed
but Harper Collins

120
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,041
was able to do the same
with me in the book, right?

121
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,333
- Yeah.
- They made it economically

122
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,250
interesting, that I
decided not to self-publish

123
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,083
just yet.

124
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,750
And I think those big
companies will continue to have

125
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,583
that option.

126
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,333
I think they're gonna
have to make the deal

127
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,917
sweeter and sweeter
for the people that sit

128
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,750
at the top of their craft.
- Exactly.

129
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,041
- We have a choice,
and they have to offer us

130
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,000
enough value in
whatever deal we do with them

131
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
for us to take our
independence off the table,

132
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,333
or for us at least to share
- [Gary] Share.

133
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,834
- some of the independence,
and so they're making

134
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:14,291
that offer, and then we
decide whether it's worth it.

135
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,959
- I know touring is a
big part of the world.

136
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,792
- Sure.

137
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:19,875
- Talk to me about,
and I want to link this.

138
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,959
We've got to find
where the links are.

139
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,834
- Well it's very easy.

140
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:24,583
- No, don't tell me about
touring, I know you're gonna--

141
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,917
- Yeah, but
johnlegend.com is the place

142
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:26,750
where you find that.
- Got it, great,

143
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,417
so let's link that
up, your tour's starting

144
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:30,041
or started, just
about to start, right?

145
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,875
- It's just about to start--
- Where's opening?

146
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,959
- First show's in
Miami on May 12th,

147
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,708
and right now
we're just in rehearsals.

148
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,500
We are setting up our
production rehearsals,

149
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,583
and we've already been in

150
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,291
music rehearsals and, 
man, I'm excited.

151
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,125
- I just got motivated,
here's what we're gonna do.

152
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:49,917
Somebody in the Facebook
comments, one random person

153
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:52,583
in the Facebook comments,
I'm going to randomly pick

154
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,000
tomorrow, no, I'm
gonna randomly pick Friday,

155
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,458
give you guys
time to watch this.

156
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,834
I'm gonna pick
somebody on Friday,

157
00:05:57,834 --> 00:05:59,208
and I'm gonna
buy you two tickets

158
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,417
to the show and
fly you to Miami.

159
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:03,083
- Oh.
- [Man ]Nice.

160
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,500
- To Miami.
- That was a good one, right?

161
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,333
I like that.

162
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,583
- You gotta watch GaryVee.
- Dunk, what do you think?

163
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,458
That's good stuff.
(John laughs)

164
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,583
- I think I might comment.

165
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,333
- By the way, also real
quick, make sure you guys

166
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,375
cut out that part where he said,

167
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,708
"You gotta watch GaryVee,"
and let's use that in

168
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,542
all promotion material.
(group laughter)

169
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,959
All right, let's get
into the 1st question.

170
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,125
John, we're gonna take some
questions from the viewers,

171
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,375
but how do you prepare,
while he's make this call,

172
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,333
how do you
prepare for tours usually?

173
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,166
Is it a lot of practice,

174
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,291
is it a lot in your head,
is it physical?

175
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,417
- Well I've been playing--
- [Gary] Doing it for a while?

176
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:33,375
- songs for a long time, so
the only things that are new

177
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,208
are the songs
from the new album.

178
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,875
We had a new album,
Darkness and Light,

179
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,583
that came out in
December, and we're

180
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,875
gonna integrate
that into the show--

181
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,125
- How much percentage
from that album do you think?

182
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,417
- We'll do probably
seven songs from that album,

183
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:47,291
in a 90-minute set, so probably

184
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:50,000
it'll be like 30%
of the show maybe.

185
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,917
We definitely want to
work in all the old hits,

186
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:52,959
and I don't
have to (phone rings)

187
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,458
practice those as much (laughs)

188
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,250
'cause I've been playing them
for a long time. (laughs)

189
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,083
- [Michael] Hello?

190
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,250
- Michael, it's Gary Vaynerchuk,
and you're

191
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,667
on The #AskGaryVee Show
with John Legend.

192
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:02,792
- What's up, man?

193
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:05,250
- [Michael] Oh my God.
(laughing)

194
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,291
Oh my God.

195
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,166
- You did it.

196
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,166
- [Michael] Gary.
- Yes.

197
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,250
- [Michael] I love you, dude.
- I love you back.

198
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,500
- [Michael] John
Legend. This is crazy.

199
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,583
(John laughs)

200
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,125
- What's your question?

201
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:21,125
- [Michael] I am a rapper,
I go by MJx Music,

202
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,458
and I've been
watching all your podcasts,

203
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,125
just trying to understand
how to brand myself,

204
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,959
how to market myself,
but it's so hard

205
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,959
to be rapper today
because everyone wants to talk

206
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,667
about sex, drugs,
girls, whatever it may be.

207
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,041
I'm freaking out this is insane.

208
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,250
(Gary laughs)

209
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,583
but I'm trying to
build a following right now.

210
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,458
I've been following and
unfollowing people on Instagram.

211
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,708
It hasn't work out to the
best, so I really think--

212
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,959
- Michael, 'cause
that's a tactic, right?

213
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:51,083
Following people and
hoping they follow you back,

214
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:54,083
and then unfollowing
you is just very low

215
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,875
common denominator, not
bringing any value to anybody,

216
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,625
and I'm glad to hear
that it's not working,

217
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,458
'cause it shouldn't work,
'cause it's a shit tactic.

218
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,458
- Well, there you go, so--
- [Gary] Yeah.

219
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:07,000
to me the main question
is the music, what are you

220
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,875
bringing to the table
as an artist that makes you

221
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,500
special, and that's gonna
make people want to listen?

222
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,708
Because I think that
content really matters

223
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,417
as much as any other
tactic you're gonna use.

224
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:19,834
I think the
content matters more.

225
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:21,959
- Michael, I think this
is crazy that you called

226
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,375
when we had John
on because this is now--

227
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,291
- [Michael] I think
it's crazy too, dude.

228
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,125
(group laughter)

229
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,208
- Let me tell you why, though.

230
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,667
Let me tell you
why, how old are you?

231
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:31,500
- [Michael] I'm 23.

232
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,917
- This is perfect 'cause I'm
41. John, how old are you?

233
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:34,792
- I'm 38.

234
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:38,082
- Great, so when John
1st hit my radar a decade ago

235
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:41,707
it feels like, and maybe even
a little bit longer, actually.

236
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:43,582
It was interesting to me because

237
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:46,458
John came up
during a time in music

238
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:51,083
where hip hop and
soul and R&amp;B actually,

239
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,417
I thought he was an anomaly,
he came from a different angle,

240
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:57,458
talked about different things
in a different way of singing.

241
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:01,375
It wasn't kind of the
sound that I was hearing.

242
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,000
It was throwback
for me, and he popped

243
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,041
because he
stayed true to himself.

244
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,792
It was really
interesting about hip hop

245
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:11,500
when I was a kid, my man,
was that in the early '90s

246
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,750
into '90 to'96 there was
so much about being hard.

247
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,375
Literally rappers
made up that they came

248
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,875
from tough places
(John laughs)

249
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,291
'cause it was the
only way to do it.

250
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,125
I would tell you that
I think you're getting tricked

251
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,625
by what's working on Instagram,

252
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,625
or you're looking
at one or two artists.

253
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,875
Your truth, back to
John's point, the music.

254
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,625
Your honesty and your
truth is what's gonna work.

255
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,667
When Eminem came
out, he spoke about,

256
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:37,708
forget about being white
and being from the hood,

257
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,166
he spoke about depression,
issues with his mom--

258
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,750
- Family issues, yeah,
it was super authentic,

259
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,750
and honesty is
what sells rap to me.

260
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,583
I'm always connecting
more with artists

261
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:51,083
who speak their truth
and do it in a way that

262
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:55,083
musically dope and
in a way that feels like

263
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:59,083
you feel the
urgency in a sense of power

264
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:02,458
and truth coming from
them, and if you give us that,

265
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,792
then we're gonna
like what you do.

266
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:05,625
- Michael I...

267
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,708
- [Michael] Yeah, and I--
- Go ahead.

268
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,125
- [Michael] I really
appreciate that,

269
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,542
but for me, like, when I was

270
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,125
in eighth grade my dad...

271
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,166
I'm being so vulnerable
with you guys right now,

272
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,166
eighth grade, my dad was
arrested, I had to sell my

273
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:19,208
house, sell all the cars, I was
15 years old, and I had to

274
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,000
get a job, help pay
the rent back at home.

275
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,750
And I've been trying
to use that in my music,

276
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,375
and it's so cool, 'cause I
only have like, I don't know,

277
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,375
2,000 followers on
Instagram or whatever but I get,

278
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,333
direct message like once or
twice a week, just say I'm like,

279
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,834
hey man, your music's
really inspiring to me, to me,

280
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:39,417
that's crazy because I live
in D.C., and there's so many

281
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:41,542
kids out there that look
up to these rappers that are

282
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:43,542
talkin' about guns,
drugs, or whatever,

283
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,917
but it's just like, I think
you can change the world if

284
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:49,875
you can make music that is
inspiring kids to be educated.

285
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,250
And stop the violence,
or whatever it may be.

286
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,834
That's my goal with all of it,

287
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:56,291
and John your music
has inspired me so much.

288
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,875
"All of me", I might have
that play at my wedding.

289
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,792
(Gary and John laugh)

290
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:03,667
- Michael, listen, 
I think you're barkin' up

291
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,291
the right tree.
Here's what I would say.

292
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,875
Don't get impatient,
and don't get frustrated.

293
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:11,458
If you speak your truth,
when at 29, you may

294
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,667
break through right?

295
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,667
Like, John, talk about
your, you know, coming...

296
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:16,375
- My journey was--
- Yeah.

297
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,834
- First of all, I started
playing the piano when I was

298
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,000
four years old.

299
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,875
I started singing publicly
when I was like, six or seven.

300
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:25,417
So if you think about it, my
career has been 30, over 30

301
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:28,166
years of performing
in front of people.

302
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,917
I was doing it at a church,
I was doing it at school,

303
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:33,041
and by the time
I got to college,

304
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,542
I went there at sixteen,

305
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:37,166
and I was singing in an
acapella group, and I was also

306
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,959
directing a
church choir, and then,

307
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,291
I wanted to get a
record deal at some point.

308
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:45,083
And I wanted that since I was
a kid, but I started to see

309
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:49,125
the path when I got to
college, and I started making

310
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,708
my first demos
when I was like, 18.

311
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,583
I started
writing a lot more songs,

312
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,208
collaborating with more people,

313
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,875
and I thought I was ready
to get a record deal then.

314
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,208
You know, I had that same
exuberance that you have that,

315
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:04,583
that you know, I'm great, why
isn't someone signing me yet?

316
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,917
And it took me a while to
realize that I had to keep

317
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:09,417
working at it, keep
getting better, keep writing,

318
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:12,959
and eventually it worked out,
but it didn't work out until

319
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,333
2004 when I was 25
going on 26 years old,

320
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:21,166
So, it's a process, and
you have to be persistent,

321
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,000
and you have to take
constructive criticism,

322
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,875
and you have to realize
that even when people say no,

323
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,458
that shouldn't
discourage you from

324
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,333
keeping going and working hard.

325
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:35,041
- Did your noes,
did they excite you?

326
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,041
I mean, everybody's different.

327
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,417
The reason I'm
asking you that, I love no.

328
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:40,000
- They were frustrating, but...

329
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,417
- Wasn't it like, fuck you,
I'm going to win anyway?

330
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:47,458
- It wasn't an active
fuck you, it was more like,

331
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,417
I believed I could
prove them wrong.

332
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:53,875
But it also made me think,

333
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,542
what would I need
to do to improve myself?

334
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,583
Because I think you can't
just think you know everything

335
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,083
already, and you're already
great at everything already.

336
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:03,291
Especially at your age,
like, there's a lot of things

337
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,792
you gotta get better at.

338
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:06,291
And if you're getting criticism,

339
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,375
maybe some of
the people are right.

340
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,750
Maybe they're not all right,

341
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,166
but maybe some
of them are right.

342
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,125
And that doesn't mean stop,
that means work even harder,

343
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,166
and get even better.

344
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,500
- Michael, for you,
and everybody who is watching,

345
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,625
the key is self-awareness,
and doing it your way.

346
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,166
For me, it was
really "fuck you."

347
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,834
It was.
It was my way.

348
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:27,583
I was talking about selling
stuff on the internet in the

349
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,208
mid 90's, and it was
hard for people to buy in.

350
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,792
Other people, it's, okay,
I'm going to prove you wrong.

351
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:35,542
But what did I just hear from
you that could build on...

352
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:38,250
I would say that one of my
weaknesses is, I don't take

353
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,834
the constructive criticism,
and factor it in enough.

354
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:43,000
I'd rather run through the wall
and figure it out for myself

355
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,750
but that's because I know me,
and you know you, and so

356
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,291
I would say, Michael, you gotta
take different pieces, but

357
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:52,291
patience, and knowing yourself
are two absolute fundamental

358
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,458
formulas for this tough game.
Thanks for your call, man.

359
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,333
- [Michael] (mumbling)
- Thank you, brother.

360
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,208
- [Michael] Yeah,
real quick, Gary,

361
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,542
can I ask you one last question?
- Go ahead.

362
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:02,708
- [Michael] So,
one thing for John.

363
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,834
John, I've never
talked to someone like this

364
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:06,917
before in my life, so I'm just
going to throw it out there.

365
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:10,041
If I make a dope track, would
you consider singing on it?

366
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,417
- Who me or John?

367
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:18,375
- It's gotta be
really dope! (laughs)

368
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,792
- Like, the dopest of dope.
We're hanging it up after that.

369
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:25,083
- Thanks Michael.
(John laughs)

370
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:28,834
While Andy's getting the
next call, how do you think,

371
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,083
I mean, that was very
nice of Michael, and obviously

372
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,291
that's a Hail Mary,
and good for him.

373
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,500
- Hey, why not?
It doesn't hurt to ask.

374
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,500
- How often are you
being asked to sing the hook,

375
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,333
or like, collab...

376
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,583
I mean, people that are big
deals, and are real celebrities

377
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,417
I assume, are in that world...

378
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:45,750
How often is that happening?

379
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,542
How do you even go
about thinking about that?

380
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:51,417
- Well, the...

381
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:53,542
It doesn't
get to me very often

382
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:55,417
because I have enough people

383
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:58,708
to kind of
filter through things.

384
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,542
So the chances
that I'll get to meet

385
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:04,041
are only when it's
really serious artists that

386
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,708
are, you know, major level.

387
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:06,875
- [Gary] It's big.
- Major people.

388
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,250
- Have you ever
reached out to anybody?

389
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,333
Or like, oh my God,
I love this up

390
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,166
and coming kid,
I wanna put them on?

391
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,708
(phone ringing)
- Absolutely.

392
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:17,667
Usually it's not I wanna
put them on, it's usually

393
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,750
I've already worked
with them in some way.

394
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,959
Maybe I've written
with them or they've shown

395
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,333
me in some way
they they're talented.

396
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,750
- [Gary] Sharon, hold on.

397
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,750
- And then I'll say,
why don't you

398
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,291
work with me on this track?

399
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,500
And a lot of times
it's more behind the scenes,

400
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,667
they're writing
or they're playing

401
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,000
guitar, they're
doing this or that.

402
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
- [Gary] Got it.

403
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,542
- And for me to use,
to reach out to someone

404
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:40,500
and try to get them
as a featured artist on

405
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,917
my project,
usually they're a pretty

406
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:43,041
established artist already.

407
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,667
'Cause ya know, why?

408
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:45,583
- [Gary] You're just,
you're at that place.

409
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,125
- Yeah, I'm at that
place where you might as

410
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,792
well have somebody
that not only adds something

411
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:52,333
musically, but also
their marketing value.

412
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,458
- [Gary] Of course, Sharon?

413
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,708
- [Sharon] Yes, this is Sharon.

414
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:56,625
- I don't know
if you've noticed,

415
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:57,792
but this is
GaryVee and you're on

416
00:15:57,792 --> 00:16:00,125
The #AskGaryVee Show
with John Legend.

417
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:00,875
- Hi Sharon.

418
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,625
- [Sharon] I know, 
hi there, I'm so excited!

419
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,166
- Where you callin' from?

420
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,375
- [Sharon] Everyone's
numbers scrolling past,

421
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,291
I'm like, there's no
freaking way, no way.

422
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,083
- Your number was
picked, where you from?

423
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,250
- [Sharon] I'm
from Safford, Arizona.

424
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,083
- Very nice.

425
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,083
- Arizona, I'll be
in Phoenix soon.

426
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,333
- On tour?
- [Sharon] Oh, yeah, awesome!

427
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,500
- You better go to the show.

428
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,917
- [Sharon] I know,
I'm like, where and when?

429
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,583
Will I have my
kids that weekend?

430
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,458
(laughing)

431
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,291
- Take them!

432
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,208
- JohnLegend.com,
you can bring your kids.

433
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,750
(John laughs)

434
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,917
- Sharon, so
what's your question?

435
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:35,708
- [Sharon] Well I mean
you're both such big.

436
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,375
- Good looking guys!

437
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,542
- [Sharon] Oh definitely.

438
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:41,542
- Obviously that's
what Sharon's saying.

439
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,375
(Gary laughs)

440
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,208
- [Sharon] You're
both strong forces

441
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,333
in your industry,
how do you stay

442
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,250
humble, yet strong,
you stay humble?

443
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,083
I know you stay humble, but
you're such strong forces.

444
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,792
How do you balance that,
those two aspects?

445
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:56,000
'Cause they're very
opposite because some

446
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,959
people come off cocky,
you know what I'm saying?

447
00:16:58,959 --> 00:16:59,792
- Yeah.

448
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:02,375
- [Sharon] How do you do that?
How do you balance that?

449
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,625
- Well I think you have to know

450
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:04,583
what you know, and also be aware

451
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,165
of what you
don't know, and I think

452
00:17:06,165 --> 00:17:08,790
part of being smart,
part of being savvy

453
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,374
is knowing
where you might need

454
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,915
someones help,
knowing where

455
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:14,833
you're not the greatest
at everything and

456
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,333
if you're confident
enough in yourself

457
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,708
to ask for help at
the right time, it's like

458
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:22,333
the right balance of
humility and confidence.

459
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,750
Other people have
expertise in areas

460
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,415
that you don't
have them in, like Gary,

461
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:27,707
has expertise in areas
that I don't have them in.

462
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,917
- [Gary] And I can't play
the piano for shit.

463
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,375
(Sharon laughs)
- And if I'm confident and also

464
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,792
humble, humble
enough to say here's

465
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:37,375
where I could
use some help,

466
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,792
here's where
I could use some advice.

467
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,667
I think it's the
right combination.

468
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:43,750
- Sharon, I think,
to John's point,

469
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,750
I think when
you're ultimately confident

470
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,208
the humility
actually comes with it.

471
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,667
You know to me, you know listen,

472
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,291
I think there's
also some benefits

473
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,417
and I don't want
to speak for John's

474
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:55,917
background, but
for me, you know.

475
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:57,667
When you're born with so little,

476
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:59,166
in a communist country, when you

477
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:02,291
come here, I get to watch,

478
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,583
just watching how my
parents navigated

479
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,083
the first decade of America,
no complaining,

480
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:11,208
working 24/7,
not having a lot of stuff.

481
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,625
You know it's very just,
it's impossible

482
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,250
for me to forget
where I came from.

483
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,708
- The same with me.
- And then I would--

484
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,000
- [Sharon] Yeah,
the same with me.

485
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,375
- And then Sharon, I'll tell you

486
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,458
the other thing that's
really caught my attention,

487
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,375
presidents, people like
Prince and David Bowie,

488
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,041
using music references.

489
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:30,291
Other athletes,
celebrities, business tycoons,

490
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,917
you know, you watch them
pass away as you get older and

491
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:34,750
you realize you know,
America mourns for

492
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,750
a day or two, and then
the world moves on, right?

493
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,583
- [Sharon] Right.

494
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,208
- And so for some reason I got

495
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,750
all-time legacy
wants and ambitions,

496
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,083
but I also
recognize what I actually

497
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,667
mean in the
grand scheme of things.

498
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:50,291
And that's very
humbling as well.

499
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,875
- Yeah that's
humbling and I think,

500
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,125
like he said, when
you know you've come from,

501
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,083
I think
we're in touch with

502
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:59,333
our background
still and we appreciate

503
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,667
the struggle that
our parents went through

504
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:03,542
to get us the opportunities
that we were able to get.

505
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,166
And we don't take
those things for granted.

506
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,708
And I don't
forget about people that

507
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,125
grew up in my
neighborhood,

508
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,291
and the type of people
that I grew up around.

509
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,250
When I'm thinking
about where I am now.

510
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,917
Even though I'm in
rarefied air in a lot of ways.

511
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:17,625
When I think
about my politics,

512
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,625
I think about my
philanthropy,

513
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,542
I'm always thinking
about people that grew

514
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:23,250
up in the neighborhoods
where I grew up.

515
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,333
And trying to make
life better for them.

516
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,959
- Sharon, I'll tell
you one other thing,

517
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,625
to keep an eye out for,
and this is for everybody.

518
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,834
I genuinely see,
when I see the cockiest

519
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,542
or worst versions,
I genuinely feel

520
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:35,166
bad for those people.
- It means they're insecure.

521
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,375
- It's insecurity.
- Yeah.

522
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,792
- It's a seed of insecurity,
that's what it is.

523
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:41,333
Like they're putting up a front,

524
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,792
because they don't
want you to get through.

525
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:44,250
I think of them
as cactuses.

526
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,375
They put up that facade,
because if you actually

527
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,125
get in there,
they're quite weak.

528
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,000
And I feel like
that has just been

529
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,875
very obvious to me,
and so, I don't know

530
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,583
that's something
else to keep in mind.

531
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,625
- Yeah, it's the
same with celebrities.

532
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,625
It's really the
ones that you feel

533
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,166
like are having the most trouble

534
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,917
with their celebrity
are also the ones

535
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:04,792
that kind of put up
that arrogant facade.

536
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:06,917
- It makes sense.
- It's hard, it's tough.

537
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:08,041
- [Sharon] Yeah,
have a good day guys!

538
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,583
- Take care.
- So sweet. It is hard, right?

539
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:15,667
And so talk to me about
that transition of rarefied air.

540
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:16,875
As people are going through

541
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,291
different versions
of that right now.

542
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,583
What was the most
intriguing, difficult,

543
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,500
easiest, what were
some of the adjustments

544
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,417
of going from a
place where, nobody knew

545
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:28,417
who you were, or
was, to now, you walk

546
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:31,250
down the streets and
people are turning, and selfie?

547
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,750
You obviously have a
very famous spouse as well.

548
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,500
So that compounds
the entire situation.

549
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,542
- It's interesting because

550
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:43,333
when you're trying to

551
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:47,125
make music and then make
that music known to people,

552
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,583
fame comes with it
and you welcome it,

553
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,875
especially at first.
- [Gary] Of course.

554
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:51,834
- Because you're like,

555
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,041
"Oh, they know who I am now.

556
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,458
"That's great. I want
them to know who I am."

557
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,583
- [Gary] This is
an opportunity, yes.

558
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,583
- I make music because
I want people to hear it

559
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,834
and I want
people to know who I am,

560
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:00,417
but obviously
there's always some cost

561
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:01,959
that comes with that.
- That's right.

562
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,083
- So you give up
some of your privacy,

563
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,458
you give up some
of your anonymity.

564
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,625
I can't just walk
around and enjoy the city

565
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,583
like a normal person can.

566
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:09,667
- Do you guys try to
do it once in a while

567
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:10,542
and see what happens?

568
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:12,041
- We walked
around SoHo yesterday.

569
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,708
- How'd it go?
- There were paparazzi,

570
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,708
we got, you know,
stopped for photos.

571
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,125
But it wasn't an
unpleasant experience.

572
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,708
It was an enjoyable afternoon.

573
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,375
- Is New York good for fame?

574
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,750
Like, do you feel like.

575
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,917
How does New York handle
you two walking around?

576
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,625
- Well, New York is
different because you walk.

577
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,750
There's not a lot of cities
- Right.

578
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,458
- There not a lot of cities
- People can grab you.

579
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,125
in America where you walk.
- Right.

580
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,041
- Most people
drive in, you know,

581
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,959
L.A. or Denver, or--
- Yep.

582
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:38,917
- you know, Houston.

583
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:39,959
Most people drive.

584
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:41,250
So New York is very different

585
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,750
in the sense that
you're physically accessible

586
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,583
to more people.

587
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,000
So you're able
to get stopped more,

588
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,333
but that's what we
love about New York, too.

589
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,000
There's that energy.
- [Gary] Yep.

590
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,583
- There's that kinetic vibe,
- [Gary] Yep.

591
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,125
- that connection that
you have with the city.

592
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,250
And as people used to say, well,

593
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,542
"New Yorkers, they don't give
a fuck about celebrities.

594
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:57,875
"They'll just let you go."
- [Gary] Right, right.

595
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:58,708
- No.
- [Gary] Not true.

596
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,625
(John laughs)

597
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,583
- If they know who you are
they want to talk to you.

598
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:02,458
- [Gary] But the paparazzi's

599
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,959
different than it
is in L.A., right?

600
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:05,667
- It used to be.
- It's starting to change?

601
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:07,708
- It's about the same now.
- Got it.

602
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,166
- Like, we're,--
- Andy?

603
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,750
- We're renting
a house right now

604
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,125
and they're camped
outside of our house

605
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,333
knowing where we're going to be.

606
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,375
- That's tough.
- Yep.

607
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,667
- Andy?
- [Andy] Yeah.

608
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:18,083
- It's Gary Vaynerchuk
and you're on

609
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,834
The #AskGaryVee Show
with John Legend.

610
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:22,291
- [Andy] Holy shit!
- How you doing buddy?

611
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,333
- [Andy] What's up
fucking GaryVee?

612
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,375
- What up man?
How are you?

613
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,291
- [Andy] I'm doing awesome.
How are you guys?

614
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,125
- Really good, Andy.
- Great.

615
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,375
- What's your question?
- [Andy] I got a question.

616
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:33,250
So my dream project
is called Banjo Earth

617
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,959
and I travel around the world

618
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:37,875
to different
countries with a banjo.

619
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:38,667
- Okay.

620
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:40,625
- [Andy] And collaborate
with the local folk musicians

621
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,458
of each country.

622
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,917
So I make a
documentary and a CD.

623
00:22:44,917 --> 00:22:48,250
And my question is,
how do I tap in?

624
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,708
I've got a YouTube
channel I'm working on.

625
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:54,000
How do I tap into these people
who are making TV shows?

626
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,500
I want to be like the
Anthony Bourdain of the banjo

627
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,083
and just make
music around the world.

628
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:58,917
- That's kinda fun.

629
00:22:58,917 --> 00:22:59,959
I like that concept.
- That's cool man.

630
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:01,667
Where are you from Andy?

631
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,083
- [Andy] I live
in North Carolina.

632
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,750
- I love it.
So how long-

633
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,208
- [Andy] I just want to
China and did one last year.

634
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,333
I funded it through Kickstarter.

635
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:13,875
And I want to go to Brazil
this fall and do another one.

636
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,041
- Couple things,
I'll jump in first

637
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,291
and then John, you jump in.

638
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,208
One thing I want to
make sure you realize

639
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,875
is you want the leverage and
you want it to come to you.

640
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:23,583
So instead of reaching
out to CAA or William Morris,

641
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,083
or production companies,

642
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,417
because of the beauty
of YouTube and Instagram

643
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:29,208
and Snapchat and
things of that nature,

644
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:30,667
the number one
thing you should be doing,

645
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:32,125
it's far more important for you

646
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,125
to be DM'ing people
with a million followers,

647
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:37,291
500,000 followers, in different
cities around the country

648
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,625
and going and
collaborating with them

649
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:42,708
than it is for you to be
hitting up a talent agent

650
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:45,333
or production
company to put you on.

651
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,792
So what I would do
is create the reality

652
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:50,333
and let it come to
you instead of you begging

653
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:53,250
to be that one lucky
person that broke through

654
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,625
'cause that's a
much more difficult game.

655
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,375
That's a game that John did win

656
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,166
but I just genuinely
believe the level

657
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:01,250
of talent and serendipity
for that is so extreme

658
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,333
in a world where
there's other options.

659
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,125
So I would tell you,

660
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:07,875
I would spend all my time
trying to reach out with people

661
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,750
that have audiences
either on Instagram or YouTube.

662
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,583
Reach out to them and say,

663
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,208
"Hey, do you
want to collaborate?"

664
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:17,792
And you're gonna get one yes
for every 900, 90, 87 requests

665
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:20,208
but that yes matters
and you just build on that.

666
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,625
And if you have talent, and
you have a unique story, right?

667
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:23,458
The banjo thing.

668
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:24,875
Right away we both reacted to.
- Yeah.

669
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,417
- I would tell
you strategically,

670
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:28,792
don't think about
becoming Anthony Bourdain.

671
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:31,000
Think about, the
next Anthony Bourdain

672
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,625
is gonna be a food
person from Instagram

673
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:36,417
not somebody that
looked like Anthony Bourdain.

674
00:24:36,417 --> 00:24:38,708
- Yeah, I think
you have the power

675
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:41,208
because what isn't you're
doing isn't expensive to do

676
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:43,834
if you do it domestically first.

677
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:45,792
You don't have to
fly to Brazil first.

678
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:48,083
You can do a lot of it
just around this country.

679
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:50,708
This country is really diverse.

680
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:53,417
You can just hop in a
car and do of lot of this

681
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:57,208
and kind of establish
your persona online

682
00:24:57,208 --> 00:25:00,417
and establish the way
you collaborate with people.

683
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,208
And then you'll start
to get more and more people

684
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,250
that are viewing it and
then you can afford to fly

685
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,834
to all these other places too.

686
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:08,917
- Andy, I got one
other one for you.

687
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:09,750
- [Andy] Yeah?

688
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:14,000
- I would DM
Delta, Amtrak, JetBlue,

689
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,708
everybody, Uber, Lyft.

690
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:18,875
I would reach out to
transportation companies

691
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,208
and say, "Hey, I'll make you

692
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,041
"the official
sponsor of my world."

693
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:23,542
So you did Kickstarter.

694
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:25,542
I'm gonna presume you
don't have enough money

695
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:27,959
to travel everyday,
every way you want to.

696
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:28,792
- Amtrak would be fun.

697
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:30,375
- I would reach out
to the Starwood group.

698
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,291
All these different
people who can sub.

699
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,375
Brands are always
looking for unique content

700
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:36,667
so they can
subsidize your overhead

701
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:39,542
and so now all you're doing,
is just it's your time, right?

702
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:42,083
Because you've got your
transportation paid for.

703
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:45,041
That would be a very
compelling DM, reaching out.

704
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,625
- Or an actual car company.

705
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:47,458
- Avis, too.

706
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:49,125
Or a car that you can drive.
- Yeah.

707
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:52,208
- To John's point, there's
probably 40 to 100 companies

708
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:53,917
that you should
be reaching out to.

709
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:56,291
Or you can start a
hitchhiking concept.

710
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:58,500
You need to figure out how
to take care of your overhead

711
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,083
and then you can really just
rely on the collaborations

712
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:04,875
and then you you're one
minute from the right person,

713
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:07,708
whether real A-list
celebrity or social celebrity

714
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:09,500
with big audience,
seeing your stuff,

715
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,458
being like,
"Holy crap, that's dope."

716
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:13,000
Hitting you up, collaboration.

717
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,375
Kodak Black does it
'cause he just loved your stuff

718
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:17,708
and your whole world changes.

719
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:19,500
- [Andy] Awesome, man.
I thank you guys so much.

720
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,083
Gary, I love everything you do.

721
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:22,458
It's been a real inspiration.

722
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:23,291
- Thank you my man.
- John Legend,

723
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:24,583
you're the man, dude.

724
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,250
- Take care man!
Play that banjo.

725
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,583
- John Legend, you are the man!
(John laughs)

726
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:30,750
So, John, have you,

727
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,291
while Andy's
pulling up another one,

728
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,375
talk to me about your real life,

729
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:38,458
not John Legend, John Legend's
social media behavior.

730
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:41,625
Do you, as a human,
not as the celebrity,

731
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,333
do you wake up
like everybody else

732
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:45,333
and go to the bathroom and
look through your Instagram?

733
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:48,041
- I do.
- Are you hot on Facebook?

734
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,250
How do you roll on?

735
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,667
- I'm mostly
Instagram and Twitter.

736
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:53,458
I do Snap some, but I'm not huge

737
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:55,500
on Snap for some reason.
It's just not.

738
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,417
- [Gary] It doesn't
come natural to you.

739
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:57,458
- It doesn't
come naturally to me.

740
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:58,792
- [Gary] Do you
engage with fans?

741
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:00,125
- Yes, I do.
- [Gary] You do?

742
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:02,583
- I write back fans,
especially on Twitter,

743
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:04,834
and sometimes I'll
comment back and forth

744
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:06,041
with them on Instagram, as well,

745
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,875
but most likely,
interaction I'll have

746
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,125
with someone is on Twitter.

747
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:10,417
And I'm very into politics,

748
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:11,959
as anybody that
follows me knows,

749
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:14,667
so a lot of what I tweet about,

750
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:16,208
or talk about on Twitter,

751
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:18,959
is related to what's
going on in the country

752
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:20,875
or around the world
when it comes to politics.

753
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:23,041
- Have you replied to people
in the Instagram comments?

754
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,708
I've noticed celebrities,
- Occasionally, yes.

755
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:25,875
- I think that's a real fun one.

756
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:27,333
- Yeah.
- You know, cool, awesome.

757
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:28,166
Got one?

758
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:30,625
- [Andy] Yeah.
- I love that.

759
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:34,959
Look, I got it, sorry, now,

760
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:36,125
Are you ready?
(phone ringing)

761
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,041
I thought you were ready.

762
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:37,875
(phone ringing)
Who is it?

763
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:39,166
(John laughing)
- [Andy] Jamai.

764
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,000
- Who?

765
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,375
- [Andy] Jamai.
- Jamai.

766
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:42,250
- [Andy] He's
got a good question.

767
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,208
- Okay.
(phone dialing)

768
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:48,125
- I wanna get a tweet
back from John Legend.

769
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,125
I'm serious.
- Hit me up, GaryVee.

770
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,208
- I will, I will.

771
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:51,875
(Gary and John laughing)

772
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:53,917
- Uh oh, Jamai.
- [Jamai] Hello?

773
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:55,792
- Jamai?
[Jamai] Yes.

774
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:56,875
- This is Gary Vaynerchuk
and you're on

775
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,917
The#AskGaryVee Show
with John Legend.

776
00:27:59,917 --> 00:28:00,750
- What's up Jamai?

777
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,125
- [Jamai] Aw, man.
That's what's up, man.

778
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:05,125
My name is Jamai,
I'm an R&amp;B singer.

779
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:08,875
I grew up on
John Legend in high school...

780
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:11,333
- It always freaks me out when
people say they grew up on me.

781
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:14,708
- You're old now.
(John laughing)

782
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:17,000
- Jamai, where you from?

783
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,917
- [Jamai] I'm from Philly.

784
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:19,333
- Alright, so you
grew up on John Legend,

785
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,542
so this is surreal and
exciting for you, right?

786
00:28:21,542 --> 00:28:22,625
- I went to college there.

787
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:23,875
- [Jamai] Yeah,
it's real and exciting.

788
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:25,917
I'm a singer, I'm an
R&amp;B singer from Philly.

789
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:28,458
My Instagram is Jamaimusic.

790
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,542
My question is,
I've been working on,

791
00:28:32,417 --> 00:28:37,708
my issue has been
creating and not documenting.

792
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:40,375
So I recently, as of
like, the last couple days,

793
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:44,000
just worked on doing
Instagram and YouTube covers,

794
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,583
like posting
them on the regular,

795
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:47,417
just so that people
can have new content

796
00:28:47,417 --> 00:28:49,166
that comes through my page.

797
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:53,208
But, my question
is I'm trying to get

798
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:55,375
into the college
market as an artist

799
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:57,792
and I'm a black guy,
an R&amp;B artist,

800
00:28:57,792 --> 00:29:00,875
but I also do pop, so it's
a little struggle for me.

801
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:03,959
Thing is, I've traveled
overseas and performed.

802
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:07,750
It's a struggle for
me to be identified as,

803
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,625
some people wanna put me in
a category of just an R&amp;B,

804
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,500
like a John Legend,
but I'm really

805
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,792
more so of like a
Jason Derulo, Chris Brown.

806
00:29:15,792 --> 00:29:17,792
I can do both equally.

807
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:20,750
So what I recently
started doing was,

808
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,041
I watched, I think, episode 139

809
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,125
when you talk
about DM'ing people,

810
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:27,458
and I basically have been going

811
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:31,125
to every student
government college, you know,

812
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:33,166
every student
government president,

813
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:36,417
and basically
DM'ing them about events

814
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:38,166
that they have
coming and things like that.

815
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:39,917
- And how's that going?

816
00:29:39,917 --> 00:29:42,333
- [Jamai] Not really well,
I know you said

817
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:45,250
maybe one out of 900,
so I'm trying

818
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,667
to be consistent with it.

819
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:48,750
But my question is,
I have two questions.

820
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,667
My first question is because

821
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:53,083
I am naturally
a versatile artist,

822
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,083
I'm naturally R&amp;B,
I'm naturally pop,

823
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:58,667
do I need to just be

824
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:01,166
an R&amp;B artist for now

825
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:04,417
so that people can
kind of categorize me

826
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:07,291
and be more familiar with me,

827
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:10,333
or should I be
who I am and be the

828
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:14,542
international pop,
R&amp;B, EDM artist that I am?

829
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:15,375
And my other question is...

830
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:17,041
- Hold on, let's get
John to answer that one,

831
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:18,166
and then we'll go
to the second one.

832
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:20,166
- Well I think, because

833
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:22,417
I think there's
already a model out there

834
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:24,291
for the type of
artist that you want to be,

835
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:25,500
so I don't feel
like there's a limit

836
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,542
on you going out there
and saying "This is who I am."

837
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:32,083
Like, some of our
biggest pop stars are people

838
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:34,834
who are black,
and also make R&amp;B.

839
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:37,166
Like Chris Brown,--
- [Jamai] Yeah but...

840
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:40,375
- Beyonce, Rihanna,
these people are like,

841
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:42,583
hugely successful doing exactly

842
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:44,458
what you say you want to do.

843
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:45,750
And so, I don't feel like there

844
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,917
I don't feel
like there's any limit

845
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:48,041
on you doing those things,

846
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:49,708
because there's
a model out there

847
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:53,417
of successful artists
that have done that.

848
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:54,792
So I don't think
it's a hard thing for you

849
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:57,083
to convince someone
"Hey, I can make R&amp;B

850
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:58,625
"and pop and dance music."

851
00:30:58,625 --> 00:30:59,458
Like you said.
- [Jamai] But the thing...

852
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,375
- There's Jason,
there's Chris, there's Beyonce,

853
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:03,625
there's Rihanna, all
these people make kind

854
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:05,625
of those hybrids of music.

855
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:06,959
And so I don't
think there's anything

856
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:10,417
holding you back
in people's perception

857
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:11,375
of what black artists can do.

858
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:13,583
- [Jamai] But the thing about,
the thing about that,

859
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:15,834
and I could go on, 'cause I feel

860
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:19,250
like on an
independent artist level,

861
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,125
like it's easier
to look at Beyonce,

862
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:23,959
Chris, a lot of
more versatile artists.

863
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:28,083
But on the
independent level, most R&amp;B,

864
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:31,500
or most black
artists are just like soul.

865
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,291
- Sure but you
also have to understand

866
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:38,291
that what those
artists have access to,

867
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:40,041
when it comes to production and

868
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:42,667
songwriters is a
little bit different.

869
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,000
So these people
are working with the

870
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,125
biggest pop producers on Earth.

871
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:47,917
They're working
with the biggest pop

872
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:50,959
songwriters on Earth,
and so it's

873
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:52,583
a whole enterprise
that goes into

874
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:55,667
making the music
they make, and so

875
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,166
you may not be
able to make all that

876
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:59,500
music on your own,
so you might want

877
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,083
to find an
alliance with a producer

878
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:03,125
that can help you do that.

879
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:06,208
My alliance was with Kanye West,

880
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:08,583
when we were both not famous.

881
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,083
- [Gary] That was a good idea.
- That was a pretty good idea.

882
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:13,834
(group laughter)

883
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:16,834
But a lot of
those types of artists

884
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,125
that you're
talking about are very

885
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:19,583
producer driven, and so if you

886
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:21,166
are also a producer,
that's amazing.

887
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:22,667
But if you're not, you
might want to collaborate

888
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:24,333
with someone that
can help you do that.

889
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:25,834
- And Jamai,
just listen, and this

890
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:27,959
is coming from the deep, deep,

891
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:30,375
part of my heart,
you're in excuse mode

892
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:33,041
right now, my man.

893
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:36,583
Like you're looking for
the angle to why not.

894
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:39,750
Like, nothing you
said is infeasible and

895
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,083
isn't happening,
you're just coming

896
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:44,375
up with the reason
it's not happening.

897
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:45,959
Instead of just focusing on the

898
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:47,417
things you need to
do to make it happen.

899
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:49,041
You excited the crap out of me,

900
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:50,750
when you said you've been DM'ing

901
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,834
you know schools, and college,

902
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:55,000
people that are
producing the events.

903
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,500
(crosstalk)

904
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,375
Yeah of course
you can say anything.

905
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:03,166
- [Jamai] I think
you misunderstood my,

906
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:05,208
basically what I'm saying is

907
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:08,250
I have like music,
I have the production.

908
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,291
But as far as the
market is concerned

909
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:12,542
for independent
artists, like the

910
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:14,750
venues, and
things like that, like

911
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,917
when I bring my dancers with me.

912
00:33:17,917 --> 00:33:20,166
I already have that,
I have dancers,

913
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,625
I have all those
different things.

914
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,375
I have the music,
the product, but

915
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:27,542
when I go, it's
like the audiences

916
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:30,333
are not accepting,
and I am really good.

917
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:32,333
But the audiences
are like, because

918
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:34,667
of my look,
it's like too far to the left.

919
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:39,458
Or you know, I might wear a
fucking latex costume and I--

920
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:42,667
- My man.
- I think you have to get

921
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:45,208
the audience before
they see you at the show.

922
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:48,458
Because if
you're creating, these

923
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:51,083
recordings and you're publishing

924
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,792
them somehow
online, you're gonna

925
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:55,041
develop a fan base
if people like you.

926
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:56,875
And then that
way when people come

927
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:58,291
see your show,
they've already listened to

928
00:33:58,291 --> 00:34:00,000
the songs a few times.

929
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,875
They've already bought into
who you are as a persona.

930
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,500
And the way you
dress and all those things,

931
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,250
'cause they've seen
it on your Instagram.

932
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,166
They've seen it on
your Instagram page

933
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:11,166
so you can't
just cold call all of

934
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:13,875
these producers,
and say, come let me

935
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:15,166
perform at your
show, when no one

936
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:17,458
at the school
knows my music yet.

937
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:19,708
You wanna get
your music out there,

938
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:22,583
so that when you show up,

939
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:25,250
you've already
got a base, you've already

940
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,958
got people that've
like, oh I follow this person

941
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:30,083
for a year and
I really like them.

942
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:31,500
And I know some of the words to

943
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,917
some of his songs
and I connect with them.

944
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:34,958
- [Jamai] So Gary, what is this

945
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,875
pick up number,
'cause that's what

946
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:39,542
I'm trying to
get into, I'm tryna

947
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:41,166
get into the market by I don't

948
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:43,041
have the following necessarily.

949
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,667
- Well that's
'cause you're, Jamai,

950
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:47,166
my man, you're
blaming the market.

951
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,208
Right, you're like, they're not

952
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:50,542
seeing it,
they're not feeling it.

953
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:52,333
I'm too far to
the left, any artist

954
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,875
that blames the
audience already lost.

955
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:56,250
- Yeah it's not
the audiences fault.

956
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,458
- I'll tell you this,
you need to put out

957
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:00,083
more music on
SoundCloud, you should

958
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:02,625
put out a, how
much music do you have?

959
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,750
Like how many songs do you got?

960
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,458
- [Jemiah] That goes
into my second question,

961
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:09,625
I have music on iTunes.

962
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:10,834
I got a few mixtapes,

963
00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:14,000
and I've been
doing often I do, covers.

964
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,834
Like official covers.
- Yep, yep.

965
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:20,500
- [Jamai] But my question,
was about the songs,

966
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,583
was like, I have one song that

967
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:25,708
I truly believe in,
like wholeheartedly.

968
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:28,333
And I just feel like because

969
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:30,500
I'm so versatile
should I put the one

970
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,375
song or should
I have multiple songs?

971
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:37,250
- Jamai, you saw
the piece of content

972
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,667
where I was
hanging out with Kyle?

973
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:41,041
Did you see that?

974
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:41,875
- [Jamai] Nah,
I didn't see that.

975
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:42,708
- Alright, I'm gonna link it

976
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:43,542
(bright bell
rings) in this episode.

977
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:45,667
You need to watch it and you
need to put out music man.

978
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:48,458
The big advantage now
of distribution online

979
00:35:48,458 --> 00:35:49,500
is you need at-bats.

980
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,875
Don't fall in
love with that song.

981
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:53,208
You may love it,
the world may hate it.

982
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:55,125
You need to put out music.
- [Jamai] Okay.

983
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:56,792
- You need to put out music.
- Put it out man.

984
00:35:56,792 --> 00:35:59,667
And if people love it, it'll
start to generate some buzz.

985
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,750
Like people will listen to it,

986
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,458
they'll share it with their
friends and you'll start to get.

987
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:07,208
- [Jamai] What if I
don't have the money

988
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:09,792
to put out music as
often as I would like to.

989
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,542
Like quality sounded music.

990
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:14,250
- Then you're stuck and
you lost like everybody else.

991
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,125
You need to figure it out.

992
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:17,917
Like Prince was a
janitor in his studio

993
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:18,875
and the quality now, yeah!

994
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,083
- It's so cheap to
make music now.

995
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,125
Like the money
should not be a problem.

996
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:23,166
- Jamai, listen man.

997
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:24,125
- It's really cheap
to make music.

998
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:27,375
- I love you and I'm trying
to be kind 'cause John's here.

999
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:29,625
Everything you're
saying is backwards.

1000
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:31,375
You need to do and work.

1001
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,750
You're coming up
with all the wrong angles

1002
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,083
in my opinion and
I'm so pumped you called

1003
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:38,708
because I'm hoping that this
is the breakthrough moment.

1004
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:39,750
Like you need to,

1005
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,208
so far I heard, 
it's the audience's fault.

1006
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:45,000
It's too far to the left,
the music's too expensive.

1007
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,125
You are fully,
fully in excuse mode.

1008
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,041
You can put out
plenty of quality music.

1009
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,458
To John's point,
it's inexpensive

1010
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:53,917
and if you want it
so bad, go fucking work

1011
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:56,166
at the studio in
exchange for studio time.

1012
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:58,166
Like you need to go
out and put out music,

1013
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,375
put in the work,
put your head down,

1014
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:02,125
and then figure it
out after the fact.

1015
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:04,875
You need to put out 150 fucking
songs and see how people

1016
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:09,417
react to it before we hear
another phone call from you.

1017
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:10,875
- [Jamai] Bet, got you.
- Let's do it!

1018
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:11,500
- Thank you.

1019
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,875
- I believe in you!
- You're welcome.

1020
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:13,834
Do it!

1021
00:37:13,834 --> 00:37:15,667
- Right I mean, that was
a, I love how he ended it,

1022
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,458
I'm glad he took
that punch to the face

1023
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:18,333
and said bet.

1024
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:20,166
That's what I was
hoping he would say,

1025
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:21,000
but like right?

1026
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,333
That's what a lot of people do.
- Yeah.

1027
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:23,750
They're like looking 
for like why not.

1028
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,625
Like the audience does it?
It's the audience's fault?

1029
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,834
You mean the market?
- Yeah.

1030
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:29,500
- The market decides.
- Yeah.

1031
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,583
The market decides and
you have to create something

1032
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,166
that you believe in.

1033
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:34,959
But ultimately people are
going to decide whether

1034
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:35,792
or not they like it.

1035
00:37:35,792 --> 00:37:37,834
And you can't blame
them for not liking it.

1036
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:39,000
If they don't like
it they don't like it.

1037
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
(phone ringing)

1038
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,708
- [Andy] Zach.
- Zach?

1039
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:42,458
- [Andy] Yep.

1040
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:44,000
- That's right,
that's just the way it is.

1041
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,834
(phone rings)

1042
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:45,667
Last one and
I got one more question.

1043
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:48,333
- There are
ways to market things

1044
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:49,500
to make people like it more.

1045
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,625
- Of course!
- But the content matters.

1046
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:56,917
- [Zach] Hello this is Zach.
- Zach, it's GaryVee, you're on

1047
00:37:56,917 --> 00:37:59,792
The #AskGaryVee Show
with John Legend.

1048
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:00,875
- [Zach] Oh my goodness!

1049
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:02,375
GaryVee, how are you doing, sir?

1050
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:04,917
- Tremendous my friend.
Where are you from?

1051
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:07,375
- I am from, actually
I live in New York City

1052
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:09,291
but I'm in Denver right now.
- I love it!

1053
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:11,500
Say hello to John Legend.

1054
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,792
- [Zach] Mr. Legend,
how you doin', sir?

1055
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:13,625
- I'm doing great, how are you?

1056
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,417
- Mr. Legend?
- Mr. Legend!

1057
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:17,166
- [Zach] I'm doing it at home.

1058
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:19,625
Hey Gary, by the way
I've emailed you this morning.

1059
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:21,625
Since you, I sent you

1060
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:24,000
my media analytics
platform but nevertheless.

1061
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,166
- I love it man, well I haven't
gotten to my email.

1062
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:27,041
I'll check it out later.
Go ahead.

1063
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:27,875
- [Zach] Awesome!

1064
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:30,375
Okay, so my question
is about expectations.

1065
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:32,875
You said you had zero
expectations which allows you

1066
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:36,375
to essentially you know,live
life a little bit more freely.

1067
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:37,458
How do you do that?
- I have,

1068
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:40,333
let's clarify it, I have
zero expectations of others

1069
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:42,041
because I deploy
empathy that they have

1070
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:44,500
their own shit going
on and their own thing

1071
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,834
and so I don't put
myself in a position

1072
00:38:46,834 --> 00:38:49,041
where people let me
down because I deploy

1073
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:51,708
enormous amounts of
empathy to understand

1074
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:55,125
they have other
variables going on for them.

1075
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,834
- [Zach] Got ya, got ya.
Okay, so my question is?

1076
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,000
- So I have huge
expectations of myself, right?

1077
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,542
I have enormous
expectations of myself.

1078
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:04,458
- What about your employees?
- I'm empathetic.

1079
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:06,458
Like of course I pay
them and I expect them

1080
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:08,750
but like if they
don't work as hard,

1081
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,083
like my friends
or like my employees

1082
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:10,917
don't work as hard as me.

1083
00:39:10,917 --> 00:39:12,500
I'm like give them a
piece of the business.

1084
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,708
Like, I'm empathetic
to what the trade is,

1085
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:16,458
- Yeah.

1086
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:19,291
and some of them grossly
underperform what they get paid,

1087
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:22,542
Others grossly over-perform.
I'm trying to make sure

1088
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:24,458
I'm closing the gap
on who's over-performing.

1089
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:26,250
I'm trying to move up people
that are underperforming.

1090
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,959
But I'm realistic about it.

1091
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:29,667
I don't get emotional.

1092
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:32,542
Everybody's putting so
much on the other person,

1093
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:33,667
I worry about what I can do.

1094
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:35,667
- Yeah.
- Go ahead, my man.

1095
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:36,291
- [Zach] Absolutely.

1096
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:39,708
My next question
would be, is I know it with,

1097
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:41,417
would you have
very high standards?

1098
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:43,375
Like I had extremely
high standards for myself

1099
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:45,083
and so sometimes
when I'm underperforming

1100
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,917
it stifled my creativity.

1101
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:51,583
How do you go about
essentially combining the two,

1102
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:53,542
or not letting it
stifle your creativity?

1103
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:55,792
- So for me,
I don't judge myself.

1104
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:58,041
I'm worried
about the pre-effort,

1105
00:39:58,041 --> 00:39:59,708
not necessarily the result.

1106
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:02,000
I feel unbelievably
satisfied with myself

1107
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,083
because I know
I'm giving it my all.

1108
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:07,917
And just that is what I'm
judging myself on my effort

1109
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:11,500
and my tenacity and
where my intent is coming from,

1110
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,041
not necessarily the
results that manifested in

1111
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:16,959
the short term
from those actions.

1112
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,625
- Yeah.
- [Zach] Beautiful, beautiful!

1113
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,291
- John?
- And I think the standard.

1114
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:21,166
- [Zach] What about you John?

1115
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:22,000
- I think the
standard should be,

1116
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,250
did you put
everything into it to make sure

1117
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:27,083
it was successful?

1118
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:29,667
And if you can feel
confident that you did that

1119
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:31,583
then you should
feel good about yourself.

1120
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:32,625
- [Gary] John, in a
world where the world

1121
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:34,041
gets to judge your stuff.

1122
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:35,959
Like, I'm kind of
like doin' my thing.

1123
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:37,834
But in a world where
maybe you fell in love

1124
00:40:37,834 --> 00:40:39,959
with a song, like, or an album,

1125
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,542
that maybe underperformed.

1126
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:44,291
Is that difficult
or are you able to say,

1127
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:45,625
wow, I really gave it my all.

1128
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:47,375
It sucks that
this under-performed

1129
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:48,542
or this song's not doing well

1130
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:49,917
or even this
album's not doing well.

1131
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,125
How does that play out for you?

1132
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:53,291
- Yeah, you have
feelings of doubt.

1133
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:55,166
Especially at this
point in my career.

1134
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:57,708
Because, you know,
I'm almost 40.

1135
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:00,583
And most hugely
successful pop stars kind of

1136
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:05,375
peak in their, you know,
late 20's through mid-30's.

1137
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:06,708
And so you're
always wondering like,

1138
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:08,375
are people just going to get
tired of you after awhile?

1139
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:10,166
- But you had your
biggest song ever,

1140
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:11,708
what three, four years ago?
- Couple years ago.

1141
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:12,959
- Like three, what is it?

1142
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:15,125
- "All Of Me", 2013, '14.

1143
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:17,458
- Do you feel a lot of pressure,
did you feel pressure

1144
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,708
when the album came
out in December to have

1145
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:22,625
a song of that
nature or did you realize

1146
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:23,834
that was a unicorn?

1147
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:25,583
- That was a unicorn,
I didn't expect any song

1148
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:26,792
to be as big as "All Of Me."

1149
00:41:26,792 --> 00:41:28,917
I didn't expect "All Of Me"
to be as big as "All Of Me"

1150
00:41:28,917 --> 00:41:30,500
and I don't
expect a song after that.

1151
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,417
- Do you expect to never have
a song, like, how do you,

1152
00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:33,875
I'm actually curious right now.

1153
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:37,375
- I literally had one of the
biggest songs in the world

1154
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:39,959
that year and it's
nearly impossible to do that

1155
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:41,125
multiple times.

1156
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:43,583
There's only a few
artists that do that, so I--

1157
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:44,875
- But what's your gut
tell you, do you think

1158
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:46,041
you got another one in you?

1159
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:47,959
- I believe I'm gonna
keep writing songs for

1160
00:41:47,959 --> 00:41:50,959
at least 20 more years
and I'll have some more

1161
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:53,625
really great songs
but again, who knows if

1162
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:55,291
they'll ever be as
big as "All Of Me," like,

1163
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:56,750
it's hard to be the
biggest song in the world.

1164
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,333
- You know what's crazy about,
and you know what's crazy

1165
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:00,625
about "All Of Me" is like,
I don't know, every goddamn

1166
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:03,333
wedding for the rest of time
is gonna have a good chance

1167
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:05,625
of having that song
somewhere in that playlist.

1168
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:06,667
- And like "Love Me Now."

1169
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:08,041
- Like, Dunk's gonna
dance to that at his wedding.

1170
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:10,291
- "Love Me Now" from
this album did very well.

1171
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:11,291
- It did.

1172
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:13,500
- Like pre-"All Of Me"
standards it was like one of my

1173
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,500
biggest songs.
- Biggest hit.

1174
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,041
- Yeah, but compared
to "All Of Me" it's like,

1175
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:17,875
it didn't do as well.

1176
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:19,834
- My man, let me give you a good
piece of advice for the people

1177
00:42:19,834 --> 00:42:21,834
that work for you, for
the people you work for,

1178
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:24,834
for yourself,
judgment is dangerous.

1179
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:28,291
You need to be reactionary,
too many people paint pictures

1180
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:30,667
to themselves that
they can't live up to

1181
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:33,875
and I think accepting
yourself is extremely important

1182
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:36,291
while pushing yourself
and they're positively,

1183
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:39,417
they're obviously opposite
energies but it's important

1184
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:41,583
to find that balance because
if you go one way or the other

1185
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:44,959
you're gonna fall off kilter.

1186
00:42:44,959 --> 00:42:46,041
- [Zach] Beautiful.

1187
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:47,250
- Alright my man, thank you.

1188
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,125
- [Zach] Thank you,
thank you, take care guys.

1189
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:50,500
- Take care.
- Take care.

1190
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,500
- John, thanks for
bein' on the show man.

1191
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,583
- Of course, it was my pleasure.

1192
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:53,583
- This was fun, right?
- I had a great time.

1193
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:55,917
- John, you get to ask
the question of the day.

1194
00:42:55,917 --> 00:42:58,375
Any question you want,
thousands of comments

1195
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,959
on Facebook and
YouTube to give insight,

1196
00:43:00,959 --> 00:43:03,750
anything you're curious
about on a macro, at a micro,

1197
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:07,166
any question of the day,
but the guest gets to ask it.

1198
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:08,834
Fire away.
- I'm asking you?

1199
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:11,291
- Nope, the universe.
- Oh, asking the universe.

1200
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:13,792
- You get to ask them
any question you want,

1201
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:16,291
I'm glad to see that you've
been watching 250 episodes

1202
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:19,834
of The #AskGaryVee Show.
(group laughter)

1203
00:43:19,834 --> 00:43:22,375
Alright, you get to ask
them any question you want,

1204
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,458
macro question, it's a
good consumer insight thing,

1205
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:25,917
if you wanna know
where trends are going

1206
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:27,708
or things of that nature,
what are people into,

1207
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:30,708
like, artists,
technology or trends or--

1208
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:35,041
- How many concerts
do you go to in a year?

1209
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:37,083
- Dunk?

1210
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:38,500
- Probably two,

1211
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,333
- [Gary] Sus?

1212
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:41,000
- No, three, four, four.

1213
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,125
- Two.

1214
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:43,500
- [Woman] Four.

1215
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,708
- Tyler?
- [Tyler] I don't know, like 10?

1216
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,875
- [DRock] I mean this is
the most I've ever gone like.

1217
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,542
- DRock.

00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:50,250
- Thank you.
Jake?

1220
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:54,083
- [Gary] You go to 40
or 50 concerts a year?

1221
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:54,917
- Yeah.

1222
00:43:54,917 --> 00:43:56,583
- [John] You're our
favorite consumer here.

1223
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:57,625
- [Gary] That's hardcore.

1224
00:43:57,625 --> 00:43:58,959
Who do you see the most?

1225
00:43:58,959 --> 00:43:59,959
- [Jake] Phish.

1226
00:43:59,959 --> 00:44:01,834
- [John] Oh so you're a--
- [Gary] One of those.

1227
00:44:01,834 --> 00:44:03,250
- [John] Like a
Deadhead, Phish person.

1228
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,000
- [Gary] Of course,
I knew that it had to be

1229
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,667
something like that.
- [John] You like the jam vibe.

1230
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:08,500
- Yeah.
- [Gary] That's fine.

1231
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,583
I may go to zero,
I'm very weird with concerts,

1232
00:44:10,583 --> 00:44:11,333
I'll go to one.

1233
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:12,708
- I used to go to
like two or three honestly.

1234
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:13,667
- Yeah.
- That aren't my own.

1235
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:15,708
- We went to yours in 
and that was so much fun.

1236
00:44:15,708 --> 00:44:17,041
That was a great night.

1237
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:18,333
John, thank you man.
- Thank you.

1238
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:20,417
- Yeah, you keep
asking questions,

1239
00:44:20,417 --> 00:44:22,667
we'll keep answering them.

1240
00:44:22,667 --> 00:00:00,000
