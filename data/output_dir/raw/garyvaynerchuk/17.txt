1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,090
- Hey, guys, #podSessions number four.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,410
At this point, I'm not gonna do the whole

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,360
intro like I've done in the other three.

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,170
Hopefully if you've been listening along,

5
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,520
you've got the context of the show.

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,680
Bringing people together that
I'm interested in from afar.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,240
Some I know really well, some
I'm just getting to know,

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,210
some I just am meeting for the first time.

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,380
I've really enjoyed it.

10
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,140
This format has been super interesting.

11
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,340
I think we're getting better and better

12
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,410
at mixing up the crew,
and I'll be really honest,

13
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,200
I apologize to the other three
sessions that started us off,

14
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,430
I think this is gonna be the best one yet.

15
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,263
- Lit.

16
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,570
- And so we are going to introduce.

17
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,400
We will start with ladies first.

18
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,970
Why don't you introduce yourself and give

19
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,550
a quick little line about
your jam, what you do,

20
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,520
and then we'll take it from there?

21
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,080
- I am Hannah Bronfman,
thanks so much for having me.

22
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,913
- [Gary] Of course, Hannah.

23
00:00:43,913 --> 00:00:46,780
I run a wellness media
company called HBFIT.

24
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,780
I'm also a DJ, and I curate
and create content for myself,

25
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,530
my company, and a lot of
other companies as well.

26
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,675
- [Gary] Awesome.

27
00:00:55,675 --> 00:00:58,460
- I'm Nik Stauskas,
professional basketball player

28
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,311
for the Brooklyn Nets.

29
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:02,260
I got traded here a couple months ago.

30
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,880
It's my fourth year in the league.

31
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,850
And I'm a huge fan of the
show, huge fan of Gary.

32
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,730
- [Gary] And we just had the
best one-on-one meeting ever.

33
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,260
- We did have a pretty
good one-on-one meeting.

34
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,093
Learned a lot.

35
00:01:11,093 --> 00:01:12,150
- [Gary] Love it. My man.

36
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:12,983
- What's up, guys.

37
00:01:12,983 --> 00:01:16,440
Illmind, I'm a music producer,
four-time Grammy-nominated.

38
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,380
- [Gary] Four-time?

39
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,471
- Yeah, I'm an official Grammy loser.

40
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:22,240
- I'm a five-time New York
Times bestselling author.

41
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,890
- Oh, they're not even
ready for that (laughs).

42
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,340
Worked with J. Cole, Kanye West,

43
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,920
Kendrick just dropped
that Black Panther album,

44
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,262
produced X with my man--

45
00:01:31,262 --> 00:01:32,095
- Congrats.

46
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:33,940
- Thank you, with my man
Sounwave, shout to T--

47
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,410
- My wife asked me about
you being in it today.

48
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,243
- [Illmind] Nice.

49
00:01:37,243 --> 00:01:38,076
- It's hit the lexicon.
- Aw, that's crazy.

50
00:01:38,076 --> 00:01:40,690
Well, I did do Moana, You're Welcome,

51
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,660
Disney with Lin-Manuel.

52
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,407
I did some stuff with Lin and just kind of

53
00:01:45,407 --> 00:01:46,790
happy to be here, man.

54
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,910
Gary Vee's the man.

55
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,200
- So this is a really fun format,

56
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,530
and the thing that I'm
starting all these shows with

57
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,430
has been really fun to explore.

58
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,970
I want to go back around
the circle and ask you

59
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,460
what you are currently obsessed with.

60
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,300
Now, a couple episodes ago,
the crew went really like,

61
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,169
"World peace" and like, very
vague, complete bullshit.

62
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,240
I mean, not bullshit,
maybe they are actually

63
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,470
passionate about world peace,

64
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,310
but I want something subtle, right?

65
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,830
Like this new marker you have
or your new teammate's haircut

66
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,470
or a new up and coming kid's song

67
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,090
or something outside your genre,

68
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,970
like you're obsessed with fixing
the pothole on your street.

69
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,200
What are you currently obsessed with?

70
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,033
Hannah?

71
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:36,070
- Okay, well, I mean, besides
multiple beauty products,

72
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,590
because that's a daily obsession.

73
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,154
I have something new
everyday, but really, though?

74
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:41,320
- Like, really, really.

75
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,370
- Really, really I'm
obsessed with this company

76
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,050
that I'm advising, and it's
like a crazy data company

77
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,590
that basically scrapes all
of your Instagram comments

78
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,940
and can tell the intent of
a user to buy something.

79
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,290
So, that's what I'm
obsessed with right now.

80
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,660
I kind of want to know, like
they could basically tell me

81
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,210
if I wanted to put out a product,

82
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,610
what product that would
be based on my audience.

83
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,860
- So you're all about the big data?

84
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,730
- I am, right now, I'm obsessed.

85
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,680
- Are you nerding out on it?

86
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,557
- I am, yeah.

87
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:11,390
- [Gary] Like you're just sitting there,

88
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,223
and be like, "Holy shit".

89
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:14,410
- Yeah, it's kind of incredible
because then you can also

90
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,368
start to tailor your own
content, and right, so--

91
00:03:17,368 --> 00:03:18,730
- [Gary] You use it to like--

92
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,563
- Exactly.

93
00:03:19,563 --> 00:03:22,385
- So, are we gonna see avocado
face masks from you (laughs)?

94
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:23,760
Like all sorts of random shit?

95
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,620
- It's funny you say that
because I've been thinking about

96
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,520
a new series called
Face Masks in the Wild,

97
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,630
where you're literally
putting on a face mask

98
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,328
and going out to do normal things.

99
00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:33,270
- [Illmind] That's sick.

100
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,120
- You might actually see
me in an avocado face mask.

101
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,515
I should have worn one
today, to be honest.

102
00:03:37,515 --> 00:03:38,670
(laughing)

103
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,660
- No, this is, your
regular face is better.

104
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,493
Alright, Nik.

105
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:44,655
- Something I'm currently
obsessed with, so I mean,

106
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:47,570
I guess being a professional
athlete, what I eat

107
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,930
and what I put in my body is important.

108
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,390
And there's this, I don't know,

109
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,290
maybe you guys have been
there, it's called Sweet Green?

110
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,576
- [Hannah] Yeah, love.
- I love Sweet Green.

111
00:03:54,576 --> 00:03:56,950
- What is this, 1999 (laughs)?

112
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,366
- I don't know, I don't know how--

113
00:03:58,366 --> 00:03:59,691
- Where are you from?

114
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:02,200
- Well, I just moved to
Brooklyn from Philly.

115
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,033
I'm from Toronto originally.

116
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:04,800
- [Gary] And is there no
Sweet Greens in Philly?

117
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,110
- There is a Sweet Green in
Philly, but I had no idea

118
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,990
that this is like, I thought
Sweet Green was just in Philly,

119
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,823
to be honest with you.

120
00:04:10,823 --> 00:04:11,656
(laughing)

121
00:04:11,656 --> 00:04:13,860
So over the last couple of months, I have,

122
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,380
I'm talking about every
day I have Sweet Green.

123
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,524
I have to--

124
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:19,399
- What's your favorite dressing?

125
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,959
- Balsamic, I have to have
the balsamic dressing.

126
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,989
- D-Rock is shaking his head.

127
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,630
- [D-Rock] I like lime cilantro.

128
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,210
- See for me, it's the cashew peanut, but.

129
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:30,099
- I haven't even tried that one.

130
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:30,932
I've heard it's really good though.

131
00:04:30,932 --> 00:04:31,765
- Yeah, it's fire.

132
00:04:31,765 --> 00:04:33,690
- With me, I'm one of
those guys that's like

133
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,299
once I find something that
works for me or that I like,

134
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:38,485
I don't try anything else, so like--

135
00:04:38,485 --> 00:04:41,560
- Wait a minute, Nik, so what
were you eating before this?

136
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,192
Before you switched into this--

137
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:44,025
- You don't even remember.

138
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:45,729
What was life before Sweet Green?

139
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:47,020
- I was like, I can't even remember.

140
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,370
I honestly didn't have a go-to place.

141
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,250
- [Gary] You were lost.

142
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,083
- I was really lost.

143
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,320
- It wasn't Philly cheese steaks, right?

144
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,530
- Although, I did like
a Philly cheese steak

145
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,410
every now and then.

146
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,066
- Yeah, they're crazy.

147
00:04:59,066 --> 00:04:59,899
- Those things are really good.

148
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,518
But too many of those,
and I'd be out the league.

149
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:03,626
- [Gary] Ill?

150
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:07,005
- Man, but aside from Star
Wars and Game of Thrones?

151
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:08,440
- [Gary] Yes (laughs), those are macro.

152
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,810
I wanna go really, really, really narrow.

153
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,460
- I'm actually, I've
just been getting into

154
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,280
and being obsessed with
different ways to compose music.

155
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,280
So you have the black and white key piano,

156
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,630
has been the main instrument for,

157
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,530
I mean, you know, you're a DJ.

158
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,730
So the piano's been our main instrument

159
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,310
for hundreds of years, if
not thousands of years.

160
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,080
So now with technology,
there's ways to trigger chord

161
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,220
progressions and different
melodies on your phone,

162
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,440
like being able to not play an instrument,

163
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,650
but be able to compose full melodies

164
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,960
with triggering on the phone.

165
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,000
And so, in doing my research,

166
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,837
I'm downloading all
these apps on my phone,

167
00:05:47,837 --> 00:05:50,940
and there's actually these
new pieces of hardware

168
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,930
that allow for you to
compose full professional

169
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,950
pieces of music and access
gospel chord progressions

170
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,480
that you would need years
of training to access,

171
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,380
but now I can do it with
the push of a button.

172
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,509
So I just think that's interesting.

173
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:05,342
- That sounds like I can
get into the music industry.

174
00:06:05,342 --> 00:06:06,660
- You can, no you literally can.

175
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,190
So I'm kind of obsessed
with being a music producer

176
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,900
and being trained in music,
but then also using that

177
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,790
technology to be able to--

178
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,328
- Not being fancy and romantic about it.

179
00:06:16,328 --> 00:06:18,760
And instead of saying that's
bullshit and being sad

180
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,810
that you had all these
years, being open to it

181
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,643
and riding that wave.

182
00:06:21,643 --> 00:06:25,520
- Yeah, and then also, too,
like where music is headed

183
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,353
because of that.

184
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:29,100
I mean, you can get a random
kid, download Free Loops

185
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,830
and be able to compose an
amazing piece of music.

186
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,420
I mean, how's that gonna
shake up the production world?

187
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,657
- It's gonna change the supply
and demand of opportunity.

188
00:06:36,657 --> 00:06:37,730
I mean, it's just the
same old game, right?

189
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,780
The Internet is the middle man.

190
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,470
Technology squeezes the middle.

191
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,360
And we're in it now.

192
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,000
- I think the next thing is holograms.

193
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,617
Putting the glasses on and
then composing in the air.

194
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:48,960
- Oh, whoa, that's crazy.

195
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,290
Kind of like an augmented?

196
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,123
- Exactly.

197
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:52,940
Like imagine ProTools, but
like moving the waves around.

198
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,200
- Totally, it's like very Minority Report.

199
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,033
- [Illmind] Yeah, Minority Report.

200
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:58,470
Yeah, it's crazy.

201
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,506
- [Hannah] Yeah, that was just a little--

202
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:00,339
- [Gary] Just do it one more time?

203
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:01,380
- Yeah, that was just (laughs).

204
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,890
- I actually think that
technology and holograms and VR,

205
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,270
that we will never get to the place

206
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,400
where we're really
wearing glasses at scale,

207
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,460
that by the time the
technology gets good enough,

208
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,160
that we're all deep into that world,

209
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,610
we'll be into contact lenses.

210
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,873
- Do you think that's in our lifetime?

211
00:07:16,873 --> 00:07:17,910
- [Gary] 100%.

212
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,743
- I think so.

213
00:07:18,743 --> 00:07:20,190
I think the next big one is in-ear,

214
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,495
and then the one after
that will be in-eye.

215
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:24,130
- I think in-ear is gonna be a lot of fun

216
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,760
because it eliminates language.

217
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,710
I love the fact that I'll be
able to go in mainland China

218
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,720
or India and we're just
talking to each other

219
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,638
because it's translating for
me in my native language.

220
00:07:32,638 --> 00:07:33,471
- Yeah, that's sick.

221
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:34,304
- But here's my question.

222
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:35,580
I'm all about that--

223
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,810
- Real quick, Hannah, I apologize.

224
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,180
So if you're in seventh grade
Spanish, fucking mail it in,

225
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,116
it's not gonna fucking matter.

226
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:40,949
(laughing)

227
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:41,782
- But that's what I mean.

228
00:07:41,782 --> 00:07:44,050
Okay, so because, right,
because that this technology

229
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,590
is coming and that it will
break down so many barriers,

230
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,850
do you think that learning

231
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,450
other languages will become obsolete?

232
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,520
- It will be commoditized.

233
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,394
So it's not that it's obsolete
and you're more than welcome,

234
00:07:53,394 --> 00:07:56,090
but yes, it is not as valuable as it was

235
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,930
in the same way that it's
not as valuable today

236
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,800
to memorize who the presidents
of the United States were

237
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,040
because we have a phone on
us and we can look it up.

238
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,890
- But you still have to do that in school.

239
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,140
- Yeah, but school's broken

240
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,460
for the reality of the marketplace.

241
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,600
- But will school be
fixed by the time that--

242
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,387
- Probably not, my intuit--

243
00:08:11,387 --> 00:08:13,340
- [Hannah] Right, which
then creates the problem.

244
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,440
- Well, the problem exists now, actually.

245
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,800
Broken school is causing real problems

246
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,555
because people are sitting
with enormous college debt

247
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:25,330
and they don't have leverage
to close the gap on that debt

248
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,530
post-school, and they
aren't being taught skills

249
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,910
that matter as much in
today's environment.

250
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,730
When you are going into a
job in the corporate world,

251
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,740
I mean, listen, college
was a great machine

252
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,760
for a 1950s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s world.

253
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,420
And it hit its apex, but it's
now clearly on the decline.

254
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,420
And, no, I am unbelievably
down on the education system

255
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,680
that is in place right now to an extreme.

256
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,230
To an extreme.

257
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,120
And so, let's talk about
music for a minute.

258
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,540
Emerging artists,
obviously, you know I have

259
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,730
a lot of passion for
that, Boyd's in the room.

260
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,550
That's been our jam for 10 years.

261
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,630
I know you fuck with a lot of people,

262
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,340
so it's hard, I'm putting
you on a tougher spot

263
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,170
where I know there's
31 kids that you think

264
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,120
really have real potential.

265
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,310
But for fun and it just is what it is,

266
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,320
it's not like you're not
naming somebody else.

267
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,240
If I put you in a corner, which I am,

268
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,798
who's an emerging artist
that most people won't know

269
00:09:21,798 --> 00:09:23,980
that you're like, "Wow, if I had a bet,

270
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,750
"and I'll be really happy in four years

271
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,590
"when Iris sends me the clip of this,

272
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,540
"and I was super right about this person."

273
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,560
Who's that kid right now?

274
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,393
- Oh wow, oh man.

275
00:09:33,393 --> 00:09:34,260
There's a handful.

276
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,670
- [Gary] I know there's a ton.

277
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,271
- I'm trying to narrow it down in my mind.

278
00:09:37,271 --> 00:09:39,200
- While you're doing that,

279
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,840
I'm gonna let you really think about this.

280
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,673
I'm gonna ask Nik, who's gonna--

281
00:09:41,673 --> 00:09:42,506
- [Illmind] I got it, though, I got it.

282
00:09:42,506 --> 00:09:43,339
- Oh, you got it?

283
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:44,260
- I got it, yeah.

284
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,547
This girl G.L.A.M.

285
00:09:45,547 --> 00:09:46,380
- [Gary] Glam.

286
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,550
- G-L-A-M, it stands for
Good Lyrics and Music.

287
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,490
And so she's from
(laughing), yeah, G.L.A.M.

288
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,750
She's from Oakland.

289
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,530
She lives in New York.

290
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:00,710
She raps, she sings, she
produces all of her own music.

291
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,200
I dibble and dabble, you know I'm good.

292
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,610
But she does all her shit.

293
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,710
And she's kind of, if I can
kind of describe her sound,

294
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,630
she's Missy meets, I
know this is bold, but--

295
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,463
- Yeah, no, this is what always happens.

296
00:10:12,463 --> 00:10:14,940
- It's like Missy fun, but Oakland,

297
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,196
very like Oakland-sounding.

298
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:17,990
- Like Missy meets Too Short?

299
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,950
- Yeah, you can say that.

300
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:23,890
Yeah, like very, like it's
Bay, but it's soulful and fun

301
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:28,240
and upbeat, but she got bars, too.

302
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,340
She could rap.

303
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,274
She's fucking amazing.

304
00:10:30,274 --> 00:10:31,970
- Is she SoundCloud or is she Spotify?

305
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,000
- She's both.

306
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,430
She's both, but she doesn't
have that much new stuff out.

307
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,263
- [Gary] Well, that's good.

308
00:10:36,263 --> 00:10:37,500
- But she's cooking, man.

309
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,350
She's amazing, G.L.A.M.

310
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,500
- [Hannah] Alright, I'm
gonna look into that.

311
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,333
- Yeah, look her up.

312
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,680
- Nik, who's gonna win the
NCAA tournament this year?

313
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,120
Obviously, you had a really
fun career at Michigan.

314
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,870
Who's gonna win this
year's NCAA March Madness?

315
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,326
It's coming, it's gonna
be here any minute.

316
00:10:52,326 --> 00:10:54,450
- Yeah, I mean, once it
comes to the tournament,

317
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,820
your guess is as good as mine.

318
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,460
I mean, anything really
happens in a tournament.

319
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,228
Like last year, that's actually crazy.

320
00:10:59,228 --> 00:11:04,228
My alma mater, Michigan, they
were bottom of the Big 10

321
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,392
throughout the entire season.

322
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:06,225
- [Gary] Yep, they got hot.

323
00:11:06,225 --> 00:11:08,030
- They went to the Big 10 tournament,

324
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,390
and they are taking off
the runway on the plane

325
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,733
to go to the Big 10 tournament,
and their plane crashed.

326
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:15,848
And when their plane crashed,
everyone got off the plane.

327
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:17,540
Really traumatic experience.

328
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,400
And coach looked at them and was like,

329
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,912
"Do you guys still want to go?

330
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:23,140
"We can call off the season right now.

331
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,770
"We can forfeit and the season's done."

332
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,140
And the players were like, "We're going."

333
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,670
They win the big, they end
up going as a bottom seed.

334
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,890
They win the Big 10 tournament.

335
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,980
Get a seed in the NCAA tournament.

336
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,290
And then make it to the Sweet 16.

337
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,016
So, there's really no telling.

338
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:38,410
If I had to guess, I'd say--

339
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,040
- You really don't want to
say Michigan State, right?

340
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,010
- Michigan State has no chance (laughing).

341
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,232
There's no chance.

342
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:44,120
If I had to guess--

343
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,953
- Guys, for everybody listening,

344
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:45,786
Michigan State has a huge chance.

345
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:47,383
He's just a huge rival to this.

346
00:11:47,383 --> 00:11:49,160
- If I had to guess,
I'm gonna go with Duke.

347
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,350
This kid Marvin Bagley at
Duke, he's gonna be a problem.

348
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,950
So if I had to guess,
I'm gonna go with Duke.

349
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,420
If not, I'm just gonna go with Michigan

350
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,080
and hope they make a run this year.

351
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,070
- Hannah, what is your favorite restaurant

352
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,010
and or actual meal right now?

353
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,425
Could be fast casual, what have you,

354
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:08,310
but what food are you
really thinking about?

355
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,490
And I'd love to know restaurant,

356
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,440
if there has been one in
the last six months or so.

357
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,460
- Interesting, well, there's a few.

358
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,660
I mean, okay, 4 Charles
has the best burger

359
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,490
in the city right now,
and it's the atmosphere,

360
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:23,391
the burger, everything about
it is hands-down, is amazing.

361
00:12:23,391 --> 00:12:24,224
- What's it called?

362
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:25,057
- [Hannah] 4 Charles.

363
00:12:25,057 --> 00:12:25,890
- Like 4, the number 4?

364
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:26,723
- [Hannah] Yeah, and it's got--

365
00:12:26,723 --> 00:12:29,142
- Write it down, she wrote
for your music person.

366
00:12:29,142 --> 00:12:31,356
She said, oh you're
streaming, so no worries.

367
00:12:31,356 --> 00:12:32,710
- And then I've been dying--

368
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,749
- Have you been there, Tyler?

369
00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:34,582
- [Tyler] Nope.

370
00:12:34,582 --> 00:12:36,160
- Can you set up one of my
meetings there right now?

371
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,030
Can you actually, while
we're doing this podcast,

372
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,850
edit a meeting I'm
having in a couple weeks.

373
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,880
Send the invite, re-set it.

374
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,010
- It's hard to get a reservation.

375
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,770
So Monday night might be
ambitious, but maybe for you Gary

376
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,380
they'll make it happen, I don't know.

377
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,213
- Let's change this.

378
00:12:50,213 --> 00:12:52,035
Let's buy 4 Charles company.

379
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:52,868
(laughing)

380
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:55,120
Nah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

381
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,953
We play it humble.

382
00:12:55,953 --> 00:12:57,550
I'll go in six months,
I don't give a fuck.

383
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,470
- There's another place
called Nur, that I'm--

384
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,320
- What's the hardest place to
get into the city right now?

385
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,880
- 4 Charles has a really crazy--

386
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,713
- Really?

387
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:04,546
Who else?

388
00:13:04,546 --> 00:13:05,420
Anybody else?

389
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,992
It's so cool to hang out with cool people.

390
00:13:06,992 --> 00:13:08,864
This is how I get the information.

391
00:13:08,864 --> 00:13:10,776
- Nur is really hard
to get into right now.

392
00:13:10,776 --> 00:13:13,110
- So both your answers
happen to be also super hard.

393
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,177
- Listen, I mean, when
you're talking about--

394
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:15,180
- [Gary] You're not providing
for the people, Hannah.

395
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,350
- I think, to be honest,
I cook at home mostly

396
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,449
because I love to cook.

397
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:19,282
- [Gary] You love cooking?

398
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:20,770
- Yeah, it's a very
therapeutic thing for me,

399
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,890
and I also care a lot
about what I put in my body

400
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,447
and whatnot, even though
I just said that the best

401
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:27,980
place to go is for a burger,
but it is one of those burgers

402
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,975
that you kind of just have to try.

403
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,250
- [Gary] How new is it?

404
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,475
- It's probably like six months old?

405
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:32,555
- Who's place?

406
00:13:32,555 --> 00:13:33,560
- [Tyler] Trowdy goes every other week.

407
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,277
- Trowdy goes every other week?

408
00:13:35,277 --> 00:13:36,198
Is Trowdy here?

409
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:37,464
- [Tyler] No.

410
00:13:37,464 --> 00:13:39,060
- He never fucking works (laughing).

411
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,680
- I know a guy who has
a standing reservation

412
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,590
every Tuesday night,
and he's always trying

413
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,410
to get rid of them because
he can't go every week.

414
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,880
So, maybe I can throw
you one or something.

415
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,722
- [Gary] Please.

416
00:13:47,722 --> 00:13:48,992
(laughing)

417
00:13:48,992 --> 00:13:50,620
- And then there's this
other place called Nur,

418
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,070
which is like a new Israeli
place that opened up

419
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,219
that's supposed to be crazy.

420
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:55,052
- [Gary] Where is it?

421
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:55,885
- It's in Flatiron.

422
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:57,630
And I haven't been there yet, but it's--

423
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,210
- [Gary] You're dying to go?
- I'm dying to go, yeah.

424
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,043
- Love it.

425
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,960
What do you want to know?

426
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,913
What's on your mind?

427
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:06,090
What can I answer?

428
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,400
What can one of the
two, three of us answer?

429
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,080
Illmind, what's on your mind?

430
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,080
- Man, I wanna know if
it really is worth it

431
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,760
to, I mean you talk about
this shit all the time,

432
00:14:19,614 --> 00:14:21,900
put yourself all in on something.

433
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,210
Is it really worth it to
go all in, in my world,

434
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,440
on the social media thing?

435
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,617
So go all in on YouTube, go
all in on all the platforms?

436
00:14:32,617 --> 00:14:33,450
- Yes, yes, yes.

437
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,396
Let me tell you why.
- [Illmind] And just commit?

438
00:14:34,396 --> 00:14:35,870
- Yes, let me tell you why.

439
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,200
It is grossly under-priced attention.

440
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,420
And it gives you the leverage.

441
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,553
- I mean, I agree.

442
00:14:43,553 --> 00:14:44,386
I just came from a--

443
00:14:44,386 --> 00:14:45,219
- [Gary] I know you
agree, you're living it.

444
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,400
- Yeah, I just came from a movie, I mean,

445
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,920
I just came from a meeting with YouTube.

446
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,940
And I took a deep dive into--

447
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,844
- Was it with Ben Mason?

448
00:14:52,844 --> 00:14:53,890
- [Hannah] Yeah, it was.
- Yeah.

449
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:54,744
- Yeah, he's dope.

450
00:14:54,744 --> 00:14:57,030
- I had the same meeting
yesterday with him.

451
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,450
What'd he tell you, though?

452
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,707
- I mean, he told me so many things.

453
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:01,970
Well, specifically, my YouTube channel's

454
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,970
for my company, HBFIT, so
we basically went straight

455
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,740
into what's working, what's not working,

456
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,790
where we can tailor, how we can optimize.

457
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,530
- My manager's calling me, sorry bro.

458
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,363
- [Hannah] No, it's all good.

459
00:15:12,363 --> 00:15:13,225
- No, he's out.

460
00:15:13,225 --> 00:15:14,190
(laughing)

461
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,970
- [Gary] Hannah, you're in, manager's out.

462
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,380
- But you know, at
first, I was like, damn.

463
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,450
There's a lot of shit I
need to be implementing

464
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,130
and doing differently, but I'm really glad

465
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,270
that I put out the content that I put out

466
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,955
so I have stuff to at least go off of

467
00:15:26,955 --> 00:15:28,590
and know what to change and where to tweak

468
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,730
and do all that stuff.

469
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,440
It kind of seemed a little
overwhelming at first,

470
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,850
but I also have some girl
who is awesome and at school

471
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,300
wanted to use HBFIT as a
case study, so I have her

472
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,329
implementing all the findings.

473
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:41,162
- [Illmind] Sick.

474
00:15:41,162 --> 00:15:43,890
- More importantly, to that point, Hannah,

475
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:47,250
guys, this is financially
viable to do the right thing.

476
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,270
Meaning, if you're in a place

477
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,330
where you could afford it, do it.

478
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,510
I don't know if you, I have 17 people,

479
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,500
and I'm about to go, I mean,

480
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,730
I just upped my Instagram ad
spend by a multiple of 12.

481
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,563
This is real.

482
00:15:59,563 --> 00:16:00,396
This is a moment in time.

483
00:16:00,396 --> 00:16:01,970
This is why we're crushing it.

484
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,770
I didn't write it just to write it.

485
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,400
I wrote it because I'm like, fuck,

486
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,650
the thing I believed nine years ago,

487
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,100
which I ended up being very right about,

488
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,900
I'm actually still underestimating it.

489
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,540
This is so fucking huge.

490
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:16,970
- Yeah, I think for me I just want

491
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,420
to make sure I am going all in.

492
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,500
I mean, when we had our first meeting,

493
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,880
you put the fucking battery in my back.

494
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,310
- I mean, I looked at your social.

495
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,143
- [Illmind] And then I
just went into my YouTube,

496
00:16:25,143 --> 00:16:25,976
and I have to do YouTube.

497
00:16:25,976 --> 00:16:26,809
- Let's talk about this real quick.

498
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:28,860
I saw that, we had that
meeting in the car.

499
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,230
And I literally watched
you go do the right thing

500
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,400
by YouTube, Instagram, making the memes.

501
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,900
I'm watching, I'm like,
he's fucking doing it.

502
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,960
What has happened?

503
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:38,628
- [Illmind] Extreme growth.

504
00:16:38,628 --> 00:16:39,900
- Well, what the, and what about

505
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,620
outside of followers and things like that?

506
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,110
Like what about in real life?

507
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:46,640
- I mean, extreme growth, colleagues,

508
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,640
people that I was cool
with, now stepping in

509
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,020
and wanting to do more because
they're seeing more of it.

510
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,926
And then they're just seeing

511
00:16:55,926 --> 00:16:58,380
the audience grow authentically.

512
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,391
- Right, so growth,
opportunity, more awareness.

513
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:05,790
I mean, honestly, I've been
looking at your page, too,

514
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,250
and I think that what you do
is, like not a lot of people

515
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,060
in the producing and
the music-making world

516
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,530
put out content the way
that you've packaged it.

517
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,301
- Not one, I'm trying to get
these motherfuckers to like,

518
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,460
you know, let's do this together

519
00:17:17,461 --> 00:17:21,069
because my community
is super undereducated.

520
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:23,130
- Right, and you can be as
inclusive as you wanna be.

521
00:17:23,131 --> 00:17:24,530
- [Illmind] I wanna try to help them.

522
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,770
- Right, no, no, no, I think it's--

523
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,160
- This is literally the story of my life.

524
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,245
It started with wine in 2006.

525
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:30,179
- [Illmind] Yeah, you were the guy.

526
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:33,203
- It was 2006, and I
believed in this shit.

527
00:17:33,203 --> 00:17:35,960
It was YouTube, nobody
had ever heard of it.

528
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,060
It was five months old.

529
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,153
There wasn't a video that had
a million views yet, ever.

530
00:17:40,153 --> 00:17:43,982
And it was really a different
world when I started.

531
00:17:43,982 --> 00:17:48,780
And nobody knew anything
about wine that was under 35.

532
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,020
And it was just, I wanted to educate.

533
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,730
I wanted people to try new shit.

534
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,910
I was tired of people drinking
the same 15 kinds of wines

535
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,600
when there was like 4,000
kinds of wines worth drinking.

536
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,228
And then it happened with just
entrepreneurship in general.

537
00:18:03,228 --> 00:18:05,490
There's a lot more people
that do the kind of thing

538
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,520
that I do on Instagram every
day, but to your point,

539
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,760
when a producer, music producer, does it.

540
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,360
I think the athlete journey, Nik,

541
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,730
to be honest with you, just like,

542
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,870
bro, you said to me,
in the meeting earlier,

543
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,883
"Yeah, okay, so I'm in
the gym for two hours."

544
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:20,410
I was just laughing.

545
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,040
People think they want
to be basketball players.

546
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,110
You're in the gym for two hours every day.

547
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,040
And that's just with the ball.

548
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,100
Then you go work out.

549
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,480
I don't think people understand.

550
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,324
That's what I told you earlier.

551
00:18:30,324 --> 00:18:31,210
And I just had these kids in here

552
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,490
when I drew all over my table.

553
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,440
From 20 to 30, I did nothing.

554
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,340
I went all in.

555
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,429
No out, no out, no out, no out.

556
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:41,200
No burger place, no club, none of that.

557
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,270
All my friends, I'm 42, all my friends now

558
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,280
who are the same age, they're like,

559
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,113
"Remember?"

560
00:18:45,113 --> 00:18:45,946
And I'm just like, no.

561
00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:46,779
(laughing)

562
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:47,612
I don't even know what
club you're talking.

563
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:48,445
No, I never went to Suede.

564
00:18:48,445 --> 00:18:49,470
No, I don't know it.

565
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,370
I don't know Tunnel.

566
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,780
I don't know it, I fucking worked.

567
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,540
And so to me, that's not, by
the way, the right answer,

568
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,440
it's just you need to know

569
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,880
what the cost of your ambition is.

570
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:04,320
So I could have been less
successful professionally,

571
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,470
and had some balance and fun, that's fine.

572
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,330
I could have.

573
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,343
It's just not what I want.

574
00:19:09,343 --> 00:19:10,900
And you have to understand what you want

575
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,410
and what you're trying to achieve.

576
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,280
But yes, all in, every fucking
person listening to this.

577
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,310
And if you're listening to me,

578
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,080
you're already in the
consideration set of debating,

579
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,970
should I go all in?

580
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:20,873
If you even know who I am,

581
00:19:20,873 --> 00:19:22,630
if you're even listening
to this right now,

582
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,520
the answer is yes because
if I, 22 months ago,

583
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,770
needed to remind my own
self, I need to go all in,

584
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,730
everybody needs reminding.

585
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,563
- [Illmind] True.

586
00:19:31,563 --> 00:19:32,460
- What do you want to know Nik?

587
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,770
I mean, obviously you
and I had our one-on-one,

588
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,960
so what about more generally
or from the peeps here?

589
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,150
What kind of music do you listen to?

590
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,983
You got two fucking--

591
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:40,095
- I'm a hip-hop fan.

592
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,400
- Yeah, we were chatting up a lot.

593
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,930
- Yeah, we were just chatting.

594
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,490
For me, my favorite artist
right now is Travis Scott.

595
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,780
I feel like over the last two years,

596
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,673
everything Travis Scott
has made has just been--

597
00:19:49,673 --> 00:19:50,610
- Turned to gold.

598
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,120
- Absolutely fire, like turned into gold.

599
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,640
So, definitely been a
huge Travis Scott fan.

600
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,190
Being from Toronto, I love Drake, and--

601
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,860
- What about KILLY?

602
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,710
- KILLY?

603
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,894
- From Toronto, right?

604
00:20:02,894 --> 00:20:03,727
- [Nik] I don't know about KILLY.

605
00:20:03,727 --> 00:20:04,560
- I don't know KILLY either.

606
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,760
- I don't know KILLY.

607
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,140
- Toronto has so many crazy up-and-comers.

608
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,517
- Canada has everyone, I mean it's crazy.

609
00:20:10,517 --> 00:20:11,583
- [Gary] Go ahead, Mike,
I see why you wanna talk.

610
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,710
- [Mike] Yeah, you'll like KILLY.

611
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,543
- [Nik] KILLY?
- [Mike] Yeah.

612
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:14,376
- [Nik] How do you--

613
00:20:14,376 --> 00:20:15,360
- K-I-L-L-Y.

614
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,368
- [Nik] K-I-L-L-Y?

615
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:17,630
He's a rapper?

616
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,590
- You're gonna love him.

617
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,040
- [Nik] Okay, I'll take your word for it.

618
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,000
- Oh, KILLY's on fire.

619
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,270
I mean, he's huge, bro.

620
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,892
- [Gary] He's huge to
somebody like Mike Boyd--

621
00:20:23,892 --> 00:20:25,870
- Well, he's huge to people who
are looking for new artists.

622
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,856
- Exactly, by the way, this is what's so--

623
00:20:27,856 --> 00:20:28,901
- [Mike] A record label
is trying to sign him--

624
00:20:28,901 --> 00:20:30,480
- But, by the way, this is
what's so great about the game.

625
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,120
KILLY's huge for people that
look at the world that way.

626
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,220
This is burger place is huge for,

627
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,100
it's just what world are you in?

628
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:39,933
- [Illmind] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

629
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:41,610
- And that's why, by the
way, that's why, this show,

630
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,836
even the way it's flowing right now,

631
00:20:42,836 --> 00:20:45,530
I'm like in the show, but then
my other part of my brain's

632
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,650
like analyzing the show.

633
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,473
I'm like, this is exactly right.

634
00:20:48,473 --> 00:20:50,460
These are people that are in their world.

635
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,350
They know their worlds.

636
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,150
They're passionate about their worlds.

637
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,730
You know five guys right
now who are gonna be

638
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,130
the biggest basketball players
in the world in six years

639
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,090
that nobody else in this room
besides me has ever heard of.

640
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,050
Because they're either a
McDonald's All-American

641
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,310
or they're freshmen at Oklahoma right now,

642
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,570
but they don't live in that world.

643
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,139
But for you, you're like, "What
do you mean you don't know?"

644
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:11,426
- [Mike] You might be huge to KILLY.

645
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:12,259
You know what I mean?

646
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:14,404
He might look up to you
with you being from Toronto.

647
00:21:14,404 --> 00:21:16,380
- Yeah, I mean the crazy
thing is with music for me

648
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,700
is that I guess I don't
really search for the next up,

649
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,540
I don't go on YouTube and
like, who's hot up-and-coming.

650
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,490
I'm more of like, what's--

651
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,769
- You're like, "Yo, did you
guys hear about The Weeknd?"

652
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:27,602
(laughing)

653
00:21:27,602 --> 00:21:29,660
- Yeah, whatever's popular,
whatever is being put out there.

654
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,090
- By the way, I'm very similar to that.

655
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,170
I'm very similar to that when
I'm not in Mike Boyd mode.

656
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,730
Once every three or four
years, I'll go into his world,

657
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:40,290
and I'll get really in it,
which is what I'm in right now,

658
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,160
and then other times, I'm
super thrilled to just

659
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,180
give me the seven songs
that are most popular,

660
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,060
and I need a little
Lionel Richie, normally,

661
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,168
mixed in there as well
(laughing), and then I'm good.

662
00:21:49,168 --> 00:21:50,093
Actually I want Lionel
on Monday to Monday.

663
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:51,170
- [Hannah] Do you listen to Hype Machine?

664
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,003
- No.

665
00:21:52,003 --> 00:21:54,890
- Hype Machine is a good,
if I always just like,

666
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,670
if I'm in my office, I
just put that on Popular,

667
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,910
and that's how I find all my new music

668
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,980
because I constantly am DJ-ing,

669
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,970
and sometimes I DJ an
event where they're like,

670
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,170
"We'd actually like you to
play songs with no lyrics."

671
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,110
And I'm like, okay.

672
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,650
And then other times
it's like, the turn-up.

673
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,220
- I should send you a
bunch of instrumentals.

674
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,080
- Yeah, let me know.

675
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,460
I would love that, I would love that.

676
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,355
- [Gary] That's the best
thing that happened.

677
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:17,079
- Are you part of Record Pools, too?

678
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:19,870
Do they feed you the new
stuff, being a DJ, or?

679
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,230
- No, no.

680
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,960
I mean, I've got a lot of
friends who are producers

681
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,430
and I get a bunch of stuff from them.

682
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,600
There's also this kid,
have you heard of Buddy?

683
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,000
- Yeah, signed to Pharrell?

684
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,833
- [Hannah] Yeah.

685
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:31,666
- Yeah, he's ill.

686
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,700
- Buddy's sick, so he actually
performed at my wedding.

687
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,807
- [Illmind] Nice.

688
00:22:35,807 --> 00:22:38,470
- It was the first time he
ever left the country, as well.

689
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,990
He's a kid from Compton.

690
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,720
And he got his passport just
for the wedding, too, yeah.

691
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,553
It was awesome.

692
00:22:45,553 --> 00:22:46,640
- Buddy's the man.

693
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,800
You're right though about
there's different worlds

694
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,310
that are huge, and if you're not in them,

695
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,410
you don't know about them.

696
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,000
- Well, I mean, I think
that's, you know honestly,

697
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,620
that's in a weird way the
purpose of this format for me,

698
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,070
which is, somebody who's
consuming on the other end

699
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,980
is getting bounced
around to four different,

700
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,920
three different, two
different kind of worlds,

701
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,953
and I think that's super interesting.

702
00:23:03,953 --> 00:23:07,800
And I think in a lot of ways,
curation has always been

703
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,980
unbelievably important and gets compounded

704
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,530
when there's a lot of supply.

705
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,950
And so for me, the only
reason I produce content

706
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,010
is to bring value to the
audience, period, end of story,

707
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,440
simple zero, zero, zero sum game.

708
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,900
And so I'm always challenging myself

709
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,330
to be better and better and better.

710
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,163
I want to be all-time.

711
00:23:22,163 --> 00:23:23,830
I want to be all-fucking-time.

712
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,035
And so this format, for me, is incredible

713
00:23:26,035 --> 00:23:28,730
because that's what's being
provided right now, right?

714
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,010
Like if you're on the other side of this,

715
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,748
you've literally just
found three new this,

716
00:23:31,748 --> 00:23:33,320
two new that, one new that.

717
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,600
And obviously these shows are taking

718
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,300
very different forms every time.

719
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,640
What do you want to know, Hannah?

720
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,443
- What do I wanna know?

721
00:23:40,443 --> 00:23:43,410
I guess right now what I'm
really interested in is

722
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:47,100
I'm kind of in a space where
I want to grow my brand.

723
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,920
I don't want to necessarily
have to physically

724
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,680
show up places to make money,

725
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,640
which obviously kind of then
translates into product.

726
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,470
When I think about product,
obviously marketing is a huge

727
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,470
part of that, and I just
wonder, for me, I really find

728
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,550
that I connect with products
that have integrity,

729
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,970
and their marketing ends
up being kind of shitty

730
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,690
because they've cared so much

731
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,970
about the integrity of the product.

732
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,580
- They're being too fancy and romantic.

733
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,450
- Right, but then all the
brands that are doing really,

734
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:21,280
really well are brands that
are actually the product

735
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,850
is shit, but the marketing is so on point.

736
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:26,840
- But I think the thing
to think about there

737
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,400
that you may want to debate is just

738
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,330
the game of how long a game is, right?

739
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,180
So, I think one thing that
people have to be thoughtful of

740
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:39,040
is a shitty product, over
the long term, will lose.

741
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,013
It will.

742
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:42,420
- I think that as well.

743
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:47,000
- So, one has to remember,
that you may deem Dove soap

744
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,600
or Coca-Cola or cereal,
Cinnamon Toast Crunch,

745
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,540
or Head and Shoulders as
shitty, but you've got

746
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,100
to reverse engineer the
context of the market, right?

747
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,770
So I think about music like
this all the time, too,

748
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,140
since we're staying on that theme,

749
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,320
or like sports, what I love
about sports is, guess what,

750
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,740
the shit's gonna play out on the court,

751
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,275
right in front of your fucking face.

752
00:25:07,275 --> 00:25:08,330
There is gonna be no debate.

753
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,060
There's no, you can't talk trash.

754
00:25:11,065 --> 00:25:11,940
And then you play.

755
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,773
And then it plays out.

756
00:25:12,773 --> 00:25:16,110
You can be mad that a song
is number one on the charts

757
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,830
and you're like that's
some bullshit, bullshit.

758
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,773
Guess what, the market fucking spoke.

759
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:20,606
(laughing)

760
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:22,420
And so, that's how I
think about products, too,

761
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:26,830
as a lot of people that
have your profile and taste,

762
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,560
and that's the truth, are
getting into the product game,

763
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,740
I'm speaking to a lot of
them, and they're having this

764
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,610
interesting point of view,
this filter, makes sense.

765
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,890
I think what's interesting
in this conversation

766
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,630
is I've blindly accepted the market,

767
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,680
and then try to figure out
what I want to do within it.

768
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,490
- So, I'm kind of doing that as well.

769
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,160
I think also, and actually,

770
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,970
I feel like you kind of know my brand.

771
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:52,730
What would you think that
the product would be?

772
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,563
- [Gary] To make for you?

773
00:25:53,563 --> 00:25:54,495
- Yeah.

774
00:25:54,495 --> 00:25:55,940
- I've got a, I actually do
have a pretty good idea on this

775
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,090
because obviously we
haven't had the chance

776
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,600
to really chop it up, so it's like years

777
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,040
in the pent-up making.

778
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,970
I think you have permission
that a lot of people don't

779
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,180
to go completely left fucking field.

780
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,190
If you and I, let's say this
went, and we got friendly,

781
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,440
and you're like, "Gary, I really wanna

782
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,273
"do a business with you."

783
00:26:11,273 --> 00:26:12,160
(sneezing)
Bless you, Boyd.

784
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,480
And you said, "I really
wanna do business with you."

785
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,150
And I'd be like, okay, only
under one circumstance.

786
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,380
We have to go to some weird fucking place,

787
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,680
bring in some product
nobody in America knows,

788
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,740
and it has to be legit shit, right?

789
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,090
Somebody figured, like pomegranates.

790
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:28,870
I was born in Russia, in
Belarus, specifically.

791
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,200
When I came to America,

792
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,490
pomegranates were huge
in the Soviet Union.

793
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,300
When we came to America, my mom
would go to different stores

794
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,610
to seek them out, and we would
have pomegranates in 1984,

795
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:41,860
1987, 1990, and my American
friends would come over

796
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,335
in those years, and be
like, "The fuck is that?"

797
00:26:44,335 --> 00:26:45,168
(laughing)

798
00:26:45,168 --> 00:26:48,510
They'd never seen a pomegranate
in their life, right?

799
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,780
And so like a lot of
people who are listening

800
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,280
who come from cultural backgrounds,

801
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,810
like if you've got a friend from Haiti.

802
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,440
They got some fucking
food that's in the store,

803
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,390
it's usually a cultural store,
you're like, "What is that?"

804
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,290
"What is that?"

805
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:00,690
I think what's super fascinating
about your positioning,

806
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:05,110
in my opinion from afar,
is you have permission to,

807
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,560
like we should go to Peru,
and find some random shit,

808
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,393
and make--

809
00:27:09,393 --> 00:27:11,387
- It's the next anti-aging whatever.

810
00:27:11,387 --> 00:27:15,640
- $100,000 fucking, you can
settle into the easy part

811
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,640
of making another uh, you
have upside to be like,

812
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:25,360
there's red bananas in
the fucking Amazon jungle,

813
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,358
and we're making fucking lip cleaner.

814
00:27:28,358 --> 00:27:32,200
You should make some fucking
shit up that is true, though,

815
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,910
which is like the indigenous people

816
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,046
have been using this for 800 years.

817
00:27:36,046 --> 00:27:39,920
That is a remarkable opportunity for you

818
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,880
that an enormous amount
of people do not have

819
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,160
because there's not a credibility,

820
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,480
a momentum, a star factor.

821
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,290
You need to be really thoughtful

822
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,890
because you have to understand why.

823
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:55,200
If I'm right, and the
product's rad, and it hits,

824
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,620
the economics are disproportionately crazy

825
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,260
because you have such a lead

826
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,310
and an ownership over a category,

827
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,290
not you're just a good
product within a category.

828
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,110
You're creating a fucking category.

829
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,030
- Interesting.

830
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,550
- [Illmind] I agree with that.

831
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,383
That's sick.

832
00:28:10,383 --> 00:28:11,660
- Got a little NBA'd in here.

833
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,230
So that's where I'm at with that.

834
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,410
- [Hannah] Cool, I'm glad I asked that.

835
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,700
- Nik who's your favorite
athlete growing up?

836
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,503
- My favorite athlete?

837
00:28:19,503 --> 00:28:20,570
- [Gary] Yes, sir.

838
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,900
- LeBron James, without a doubt.

839
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,160
- [Gary] Really?
- Yeah.

840
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,993
- [Gary] All you young fuckers (laughs).

841
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:24,826
- I was a huge--

842
00:28:24,826 --> 00:28:25,659
- How old are you?

843
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:26,492
- 24.

844
00:28:26,492 --> 00:28:27,325
- Oh wow.

845
00:28:27,325 --> 00:28:28,420
- I was a huge LeBron fan.

846
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,240
First time I watched
him play was in Toronto.

847
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,390
I was 11 years old.

848
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,800
He was kind of just starting
out his career at that point.

849
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,610
And the first time he walked
out of the tunnel, I cried.

850
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,710
I cried when I saw him in person.

851
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,100
And then by the time--

852
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,330
- How did your dad or mom or
friend react to your crying?

853
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,640
- They, I mean, they just
knew I was obsessed with him.

854
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,070
So they were like, "That's
just Nik being Nik."

855
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,903
You know what I mean?

856
00:28:49,903 --> 00:28:50,736
They didn't think anything of it.

857
00:28:50,736 --> 00:28:54,680
But, my obsession got to
the point where every year

858
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,540
my Christmas present
was a trip to Cleveland

859
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,930
to watch the Cavs play.

860
00:28:59,021 --> 00:29:01,940
- So what happened the first
your team, so your rookie year,

861
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,240
tell me the full story, go.

862
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,080
Your rookie year, tell everybody
who you were drafted by.

863
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,920
- I was drafted eighth overall

864
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,480
by the Sacramento Kings in 2014.

865
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,270
And so I'm playing for the
Kings, we're in Cleveland,

866
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:16,170
and the whole day leading up to the game,

867
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,800
my stomach's just in knots.

868
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,450
My first year, every game was
exciting because every night

869
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:24,020
I was going up against someone
that I had looked up to

870
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,684
as a kid, but LeBron was
a different story for me.

871
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:29,460
And so the game starts--

872
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,700
- Did you cry when you (laughs)?

873
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,533
- No, I didn't cry.

874
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:32,366
I didn't cry this time.

875
00:29:32,366 --> 00:29:33,370
I didn't cry.

876
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:37,630
But the game starts and LeBron and I are,

877
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,760
like we play different positions,

878
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,040
so we weren't guarding each other.

879
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,070
But then maybe a minute and
a half, two minutes into

880
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,940
when I checked into the
game, it just happened

881
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,340
that in transition
there was a missed shot.

882
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,660
We came down on offense,
he matched up with me,

883
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,152
and he called it out, too.

884
00:29:53,152 --> 00:29:56,450
He says, "I got Stauskas," and I was like,

885
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,357
did anyone else hear that?

886
00:29:57,357 --> 00:29:58,190
He knows who I am.

887
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,023
(laughing)

888
00:29:59,023 --> 00:30:00,286
He just said my name.

889
00:30:00,286 --> 00:30:03,360
And for the whole possession,
I didn't even touch the ball,

890
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,600
he was just right next to me,
and I was just looking around.

891
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,420
I was like, does everybody see this?

892
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,880
LeBron's guarding me right now.

893
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,770
- That's awesome.

894
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,570
- [Illmind] That must have felt surreal.

895
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,036
- For me, that was like--

896
00:30:13,036 --> 00:30:14,930
- Illmind, did you have something
like that in the studio?

897
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:15,763
Have you ever had that happen?

898
00:30:15,763 --> 00:30:17,550
- [Illmind] Yeah, always man, always.

899
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,460
- No, but I get it, there's
a lot of people you--

900
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,918
- [Illmind] Oh, a specific one?

901
00:30:20,918 --> 00:30:22,380
- Yeah, something like that
because obviously he had other

902
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,350
players he appreciated and
had stories, but I mean like

903
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,440
for real, for real.

904
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,930
- First time I met Dre, Dr. Dre.

905
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,604
I mean, Dre was--

906
00:30:30,604 --> 00:30:32,850
- [Gary] Give me the story.
- The guy.

907
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:36,790
Okay, so, 2013 I'm in LA.

908
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,890
And I'm at this studio in LA.

909
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:42,210
And I get a call from
my guy who, at the time,

910
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,680
just got hired to be in A&R at Aftermath.

911
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,430
And so I knew him from years ago

912
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,330
when he was doing some other stuff.

913
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,550
And so he's like, "Yo,
Ill, what are you doing?"

914
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,680
I'm like, yo, I'm in LA.

915
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,513
I'm in the studio.

916
00:30:51,513 --> 00:30:53,130
He's like, "Yo, I'm out here.

917
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,160
"I'm with Dre.

918
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,370
"Where you at?"

919
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,820
And I give him the address
to the studio, and he's like,

920
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,250
"Yo, me and Dre are across
the street at the bar."

921
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,420
So I'm like, Dr. Dre?

922
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,720
(laughing)

923
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,640
He's like, "Yeah, me
and Doc are over here."

924
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,740
He's like, "Yo, come
through, come say what's up."

925
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,824
So I leave the studio,
and I go into the bar,

926
00:31:12,824 --> 00:31:16,290
and I see my man and Dre, Tahim.

927
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:20,504
And I meet Dre for the first
time, I'm like super stoked.

928
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:22,470
He's like, "Yo, Illmind, what's up, man?

929
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,490
"Yo, my man Tahim told
me you got that fire."

930
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:28,062
I'm like, yeah, you know,
I'm alright (laughs).

931
00:31:28,062 --> 00:31:28,940
I do dabble a little bit.

932
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,020
And so we're having drinks.

933
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,590
He's buying me a shot.

934
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,830
And he's looking at me, like,

935
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,600
"Yo, Illmind, can't wait
to hear these joints."

936
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,900
I'm like, yeah, you know, we'll get in.

937
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,820
We'll get in.

938
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,620
And he's like, "You got a studio?"

939
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,060
I'm like, yeah.

940
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,350
And so, I'm like, yeah,
come across the street.

941
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,490
I'm actually in a session.

942
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,730
I have the room.

943
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,350
So then we leave the
bar, so it's me, Dr. Dre,

944
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,520
and my man, Tahim, and
so we go into the studio.

945
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,870
- [Gary] And you're thinking
what as you're walking in?

946
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:57,870
- I'm like, I'm 50% super
confident and stoked

947
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,950
because I love my shit and
I can't wait to show him.

948
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:06,010
And then 50% nervous as
fuck, like, oh my God.

949
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,910
I'm about to play my stuff for Dr. Dre.

950
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,160
And so he's sitting back there.

951
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,830
I'm on the board, speakers.

952
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,900
And then I plug my computer in.

953
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,490
And I start hitting play on some beats,

954
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,900
like a minute per beat,
just playing beats.

955
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,000
And I'm not looking back
because I'm super nervous.

956
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,470
I'm like, in my mind, Dre is doing this.

957
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,150
Like he's wildin' out in the back.

958
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,630
And so I'm looking straight,

959
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,720
and I'm just playing all my beats.

960
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,190
I'm like, yeah, I know
Dre fucks with this.

961
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,320
I know he loves this,
I know he loves this.

962
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,150
And then so a couple beats
in, I glance to the back.

963
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:43,000
And Dre is looking down
on his phone like this.

964
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,430
Super bored, not feeling anything.

965
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,320
And I was just like, damn.

966
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,970
My heart broke, and I was like, fuck.

967
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,870
So anyway, I stop playing it.

968
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,990
And then I had a convo with Dre.

969
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:53,970
He's like, "You know,"

970
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,730
he's like, "Your shit is cool,

971
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:59,160
"but it ain't really nothing
I haven't heard before."

972
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,590
And then we got into a
really deep conversation.

973
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,600
He was schooling me on stuff.

974
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,620
And then that was that.

975
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,120
And then a year later, I come back to LA.

976
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,180
And then he's working
on an actual project,

977
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,820
and then we start working together.

978
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,920
And he's showing me, this
is when the NWA movie,

979
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,960
before it dropped, he was
showing me trailers of the movie

980
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,660
and I'm super stoked.

981
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,910
Dr. Dre is showing me
clips of the new NWA movie

982
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,900
that no one has seen yet.

983
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,310
So then we get in the studio again.

984
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,760
He's like, "Yo, Illmind,
play me some stuff."

985
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,910
And he loved everything.

986
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:29,920
And he was like, "Yo."

987
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,020
And he recorded some
shit, and then from there

988
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,473
we just started a working relationship.

989
00:33:33,473 --> 00:33:34,306
- That's amazing.

990
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:36,620
- So my first experience was terrible,

991
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,428
but then because I just kept
going and kept at it, I got.

992
00:33:40,428 --> 00:33:43,470
And now, every time I see
Dre, it's super amazing,

993
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,270
but I still get super nervous around him

994
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,120
because it's always gonna be Dre.

995
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,355
- You got one, you said.

996
00:33:48,355 --> 00:33:51,160
- Yeah, I had one, a
had a moment this week,

997
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,993
which was this week.

998
00:33:51,993 --> 00:33:54,540
- This week you had your
core, like again, remember,

999
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,890
these guys have met other people,

1000
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,590
but you're saying this is the one?

1001
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,423
Happened this week?

1002
00:33:58,423 --> 00:34:00,050
- Dude, it happened this week, literally.

1003
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:03,660
I had a shot of tequila with Oprah.

1004
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,020
- No!

1005
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,437
- [Gary] Wow.

1006
00:34:06,437 --> 00:34:07,440
- [Illmind] Airhorn.

1007
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,679
- Literally, right?

1008
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,914
I mean that was, listen, Oprah--

1009
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:14,320
- You had a shot of
tequila with Oprah Winfrey?

1010
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,395
Not Oprah Thompson.

1011
00:34:15,395 --> 00:34:16,320
- No, no, no Oprah Winfrey.

1012
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,110
By the way, in Harlem, okay?

1013
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,520
It doesn't really get better than that.

1014
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,732
- Wait, was that at Red Rooster?

1015
00:34:22,732 --> 00:34:24,364
- It was not at Red
Rooster, it was at this--

1016
00:34:24,364 --> 00:34:25,197
- I love him, man.

1017
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:26,780
I love that place.

1018
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,030
Marcus, big shout-out.

1019
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,404
Guys, if you ever come to New York

1020
00:34:29,404 --> 00:34:31,639
and you need to go to Red Rooster.

1021
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,919
It's in Harlem, the flavor's legit.

1022
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,110
It's just a good experience.

1023
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,943
But go ahead.

1024
00:34:35,943 --> 00:34:37,449
- Okay, so the Studio Museum in Harlem

1025
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,919
is an iconic museum here in New York City.

1026
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,830
My mom has done tons of work
for them over the years.

1027
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,280
I actually, it was a
full circle situation.

1028
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,190
So I'd been going there ever since

1029
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,409
I was in my mom's snuggly pack.

1030
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:54,159
And I got a call, two weeks
ago, asking if I could DJ

1031
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,180
the OWN Network event
at the Studio Museum,

1032
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,971
which will be the last event
that will ever take place

1033
00:35:00,971 --> 00:35:04,010
in the Studio Museum because
they are closing that building,

1034
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,150
tearing it down, and building a new one.

1035
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:06,983
- That is not true.

1036
00:35:06,983 --> 00:35:09,080
I'm gonna run there
now and put on an event

1037
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,580
because I wanna be the last event.

1038
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,752
I'm just kidding (laughing).

1039
00:35:11,752 --> 00:35:12,585
- No, I already did it.

1040
00:35:12,585 --> 00:35:13,418
I already did it.

1041
00:35:13,418 --> 00:35:15,560
So I go and I'm like, okay, Mom,

1042
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,460
you gotta come to the event.

1043
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,293
This is crazy.

1044
00:35:18,293 --> 00:35:19,860
I didn't even think
Oprah was gonna be there,

1045
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,693
you know what I mean?

1046
00:35:20,693 --> 00:35:23,260
I just thought I'm like
DJ-ing a corporate,

1047
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,470
another corporate event, and
this time it was gonna be

1048
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,831
uptown, full of black people,
so it was gonna be fun.

1049
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:28,664
(laughing)

1050
00:35:28,664 --> 00:35:30,340
So I'm like, I'm down.

1051
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,170
So I go and Oprah's there.

1052
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:36,120
And next thing you know,
I'm on a second level,

1053
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,960
so I'm like, oh, I'm probably not gonna

1054
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,910
get to meet her or anything.

1055
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:42,390
Next thing you know, after
she gives her speech,

1056
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:46,470
she comes upstairs,
introduced herself to me,

1057
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:49,140
and everyone in the whole place

1058
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,600
is gonna take a shot of tequila.

1059
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:55,080
And she hands me her shot,
then gets another one,

1060
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,140
cheers me, says her whole
thing, we took a shot together.

1061
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,070
I mean, granted, it
was also with the other

1062
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,050
hundred people in the room, but we were

1063
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,700
right next to each other, and
she handed me her tequila.

1064
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,880
It was a major moment.

1065
00:36:08,827 --> 00:36:11,430
It felt, and also, it's Oprah.

1066
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:15,710
I aspire to have so many of her qualities

1067
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,860
and make an impact on
the world like she has.

1068
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,250
And it was just epic.

1069
00:36:22,798 --> 00:36:24,080
- That's fucking awesome.

1070
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,410
Good for you.
- [Hannah] Thanks.

1071
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,170
- What is your first Instagram post?

1072
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,230
I want you to pull up
your phone right now.

1073
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,063
- [Illmind] How do I do that?

1074
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,098
- What?
- How do I pull?

1075
00:36:32,098 --> 00:36:33,239
- [Gary] We're gonna teach you.

1076
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,072
- Okay.

1077
00:36:34,072 --> 00:36:34,905
- [Gary] Stop your fucking stream.

1078
00:36:34,905 --> 00:36:35,960
- Okay, sorry guys.

1079
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,669
- [Gary] Hit the fucking Instagram logo.

1080
00:36:37,669 --> 00:36:38,502
- [Illmind] We out.

1081
00:36:38,502 --> 00:36:39,340
- Let's go Nik, I wanna see it.

1082
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,045
I'm gonna explain it visually.

1083
00:36:42,045 --> 00:36:43,741
You're just gonna keep
scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.

1084
00:36:43,741 --> 00:36:44,790
I think it's a fun thing--

1085
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,278
- It's so funny, I remember
mine like it was yesterday.

1086
00:36:46,278 --> 00:36:47,126
- [Illind] You do?
- Yeah.

1087
00:36:47,126 --> 00:36:48,450
- [Gary] Alright, pull it up, pull it up.

1088
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,890
- Wait so, I have to manually scroll?

1089
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:50,723
Just fucking go.

1090
00:36:51,622 --> 00:36:53,300
- Actually, Instagram,
if you're listening,

1091
00:36:55,231 --> 00:36:57,570
Ishmon is Instagram, if
you're listening right now,

1092
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,230
we'd like to you add a
button that allows you

1093
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,680
to go directly to your first.

1094
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,553
Yeah, it takes a while,

1095
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,360
and you know how it does the whole thing.

1096
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,193
- [Hannah] This is gonna take forever.

1097
00:37:05,193 --> 00:37:06,026
- Yeah, yeah, no, it's
gonna take you forever.

1098
00:37:06,026 --> 00:37:06,859
I know, we're gonna keep doing it.

1099
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:08,070
- Well, I can just describe it.

1100
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,530
- No, no, I want to really look at it.

1101
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,060
- [Nik] I'm almost embarrassed.

1102
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,180
I don't even know what's gonna come up.

1103
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,250
- Well, this is a very fun thing.

1104
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,590
This is a new game we've
just created on the spot.

1105
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:18,960
What is your first Instagram photo ever?

1106
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,850
I see Tyler Schmidt is doing it.

1107
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,930
Anikon, the legend, is
here, but he's not doing it.

1108
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,740
He's too fucking fresh to do it.

1109
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,550
But I wanna see what everybody's
first Instagram photo is

1110
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,110
and, as a matter of fact,
for everybody listening,

1111
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:31,943
I'm gonna do a contest.

1112
00:37:31,943 --> 00:37:34,630
I'm gonna send somebody
five signed books, five.

1113
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,670
This is where you can sell them

1114
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,670
for 20 bucks on eBay and make some cash.

1115
00:37:39,148 --> 00:37:41,880
To one person randomly, go to your phone,

1116
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,350
go to your profile, go to your
first Instagram photo ever,

1117
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:48,010
screenshot your phone, Tweet
it at me, and put #GVfirst.

1118
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,730
Yeah, #GVfirst, that'll be fine.

1119
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:51,563
I'll find it.

1120
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:52,423
And I'm gonna pick one of you.

1121
00:37:52,423 --> 00:37:53,650
- [Hannah] GVfirstIG.

1122
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,760
- Okay, fine, thanks HB, #GVfirstIG

1123
00:37:56,789 --> 00:37:58,150
because we're collaborating here.

1124
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,960
And I will pick one of you.

1125
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,793
You found it Nik?

1126
00:38:00,793 --> 00:38:01,626
- Found it.

1127
00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:02,459
- [Gary] Nik, let's see it.

1128
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:03,375
- You probably haven't
posted that many, though.

1129
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:04,349
- This is actually funny.

1130
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:05,670
- [Gary] Okay, first, when is it?

1131
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,569
Keep going, Ill.

1132
00:38:06,569 --> 00:38:07,402
Hannah?

1133
00:38:07,402 --> 00:38:08,470
Hannah, I don't care.

1134
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,840
- Your wifi's like not--

1135
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,910
- My wifi's fucking badass,
don't try to diss on the wifi.

1136
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,850
Keep fucking going.

1137
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:16,302
- [Illmind] I'm on 3G,
I'm not even on Wifi.

1138
00:38:16,302 --> 00:38:18,550
- [Gary] Nik's first photo ever

1139
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,670
is with LeBron James (laughs).

1140
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,746
- [Hannah] Stop.

1141
00:38:21,746 --> 00:38:22,969
- [Nik] It's me and LeBron.

1142
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:25,386
- [Gary] December 28th, 2012.

1143
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,417
- That was worth creating an account.

1144
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:28,250
- [Nik] Yeah.

1145
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,377
- [Hannah] You look
like such a little baby.

1146
00:38:29,377 --> 00:38:30,680
- That's crazy bro.

1147
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,790
- [Nik] I created the account
for that picture, I think.

1148
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,240
- [Illmind] That's insane.
- Oh my God.

1149
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,090
- That's unbelievable.

1150
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,330
How's you get, what happened?

1151
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,630
You were a good player and
they got you in, like what was?

1152
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,980
Why do you have this photo?

1153
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,880
- That was my first year at
the University of Michigan,

1154
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,330
and one of my teammates at Michigan,

1155
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,730
who now plays for the Knicks,
his name's Tim Hardaway Jr.

1156
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,370
He played with me and his father

1157
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,070
worked for the Heat at that time.

1158
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,910
And so the Heat were playing
the Pistons in Detroit.

1159
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,224
- Keep going Hannah, don't give up.

1160
00:38:55,224 --> 00:38:56,057
Don't fucking give up.

1161
00:38:56,057 --> 00:38:57,150
Iris, do you wanna help Hannah?

1162
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,390
You're a big fan of her work.

1163
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:00,620
Can you please scroll her Instagram?

1164
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,130
Iris, can you please
scroll Hannah's Instagram?

1165
00:39:04,012 --> 00:39:06,623
- [Hannah] You don't have to
scroll through my Instagram.

1166
00:39:06,623 --> 00:39:07,530
I'm not done.

1167
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,550
- I'm on 2014 right now.

1168
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,920
- I mean, how many posts
have you, Nik, how many posts

1169
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,620
have you posted on your Instagram?

1170
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,674
It says it's one of the top--

1171
00:39:16,674 --> 00:39:17,751
- 623 posts.

1172
00:39:17,751 --> 00:39:19,117
- 623, okay.

1173
00:39:19,117 --> 00:39:21,480
3,500.

1174
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,680
- Yeah, okay, so you're gonna have

1175
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,690
to scroll for six times longer.

1176
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:25,821
Nothing too crazy.

1177
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,308
We'll be here for a little bit longer.

1178
00:39:27,308 --> 00:39:28,141
Ill?

1179
00:39:28,141 --> 00:39:29,390
- I'm good, yeah, I'm going.

1180
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,290
I'm still going.

1181
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,220
- While you guys are doing this,

1182
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,920
I want everybody also to go and look at

1183
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,400
Oprah's first-ever Instagram photo.

1184
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,780
- [Hannah] How are we supposed
to do both at the same time?

1185
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,880
- Well, you're not supposed to do that,

1186
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,620
but we'll have somebody do that while,

1187
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,700
why don't you do that Seth?

1188
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,630
We're gonna pull up Oprah,
since we just talked

1189
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,160
about her first Instagram photo, as well.

1190
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,250
- I love Oprah.

1191
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,210
- [Gary] You love her so much, right?

1192
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,043
- I really do.

1193
00:39:48,043 --> 00:39:50,400
- And her first Instagram
photo should be pretty iconic.

1194
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,550
- [Illmind] How's her aura?

1195
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,930
- She's powerful.

1196
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:56,590
Honestly, she commands attention.

1197
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:59,060
She speaks with such
authority and vulnerability.

1198
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:02,449
- [Gary] Hannah is talking
and scrolling as we speak.

1199
00:40:02,449 --> 00:40:03,282
- It's kind of insane.

1200
00:40:03,282 --> 00:40:05,256
- She's doing a no-look scroll.

1201
00:40:05,256 --> 00:40:06,850
It's kind of like a no-look pass, Nik.

1202
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,380
She's doing no-look (laughs).

1203
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,340
- Dre has that same, you know when

1204
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,324
certain people walk in a room?

1205
00:40:11,324 --> 00:40:12,157
- [Hannah] They just do.

1206
00:40:12,157 --> 00:40:13,040
- [Gary] Legends have
aura, that's just real.

1207
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,940
- And it's like, they
don't have to say anything.

1208
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,760
- I love that song, by the way, Neon Guts.

1209
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,593
- [Illmind] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1210
00:40:18,593 --> 00:40:19,426
- I love that song.

1211
00:40:19,426 --> 00:40:20,259
- [Illmind] Neon Guts is my shit.

1212
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:25,259
- I have a running list in
my notes of good rap lyrics

1213
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:27,260
that would make a good Instagram caption,

1214
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,328
and that's one of them, Neon
Guts and the Colorful Aura.

1215
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,590
- [Illmind] Pharrell's a genius, man.

1216
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,080
- Hannah, how's your
scrolling coming along?

1217
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,943
- [Hannah] I mean, it's going, it's going.

1218
00:40:34,943 --> 00:40:35,967
- [Illmind] I'm at 2014.

1219
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:37,120
- Okay, we've got Oprah's first photo.

1220
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,970
Let's see what it is.

1221
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,670
- [Illmind] This is fun, actually.

1222
00:40:42,582 --> 00:40:43,415
- What?

1223
00:40:43,415 --> 00:40:44,710
(laughing)

1224
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,543
- [Illmind] What is it?

1225
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:47,141
- Are you for real?

1226
00:40:47,141 --> 00:40:49,100
- What date is that?

1227
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,240
- This is really upsetting.

1228
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,540
This is April 25th, 2012.

1229
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,020
And Oprah's first photo is of Gary Vee.

1230
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,455
- No.

1231
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,280
- You know, just trying
to live life out here.

1232
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,113
- See?

1233
00:41:01,113 --> 00:41:03,463
You knew, you set this up so fucking well.

1234
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:05,296
- What a fucking flex!

1235
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:07,048
Hold on.

1236
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:07,881
- If I had known I was giving you

1237
00:41:07,881 --> 00:41:08,920
a fucking lay-up right there.

1238
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,958
- [Gary] Lay-ups out here.

1239
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:11,630
Nik's here, I gotta throw a lay-ups.

1240
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,723
I gotta throw lay-ups.

1241
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:14,350
Uh, uh.

1242
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,640
- That's crazy.

1243
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,880
- [Gary] That was fun.
- [Illmind] Fuck.

1244
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,713
- [Gary] That was a little fun for me.

1245
00:41:17,713 --> 00:41:19,600
- Guys, mine's gonna be so anticlimactic.

1246
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,673
It's gonna be.

1247
00:41:20,673 --> 00:41:21,506
- Well, I get it.

1248
00:41:21,506 --> 00:41:24,849
Well, actually, so far
Nik's was with LeBron.

1249
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,334
Oprah's first photo was with me.

1250
00:41:27,334 --> 00:41:29,134
(laughing)

1251
00:41:29,134 --> 00:41:31,500
Actually, what's my first photo?

1252
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,319
It's gonna be ridiculous.

1253
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:35,030
Actually, can you, Tyler can we--

1254
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,010
- Oh, I'm actually getting close.

1255
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:37,843
I have a lot.

1256
00:41:37,843 --> 00:41:39,886
I probably, how many do you have, Hannah?

1257
00:41:39,886 --> 00:41:41,447
- [Hannah] I have
probably more than 3,500.

1258
00:41:41,447 --> 00:41:42,590
- When did you join?

1259
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,423
What year?

1260
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:48,390
- It was actually New Year's
Eve that I posted my first,

1261
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:51,097
and I think it was New Year's of 2012.

1262
00:41:51,097 --> 00:41:54,300
- Nik, what was your
favorite toy as a kid?

1263
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,350
While these guys are going through that,

1264
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,920
we're gonna go through favorite toy.

1265
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,380
Singular, favorite toy as a child.

1266
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,595
- Oh you know what it was called?

1267
00:42:02,595 --> 00:42:03,729
(laughing)

1268
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,562
- [Gary] Yes, I just love your face

1269
00:42:04,562 --> 00:42:05,690
how you actually figured it out.

1270
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,100
- What was it called, it was a beatbox.

1271
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,780
You know those like, "Twist it!

1272
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,613
"Pull it!"

1273
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:11,530
And then it was like--

1274
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:12,363
- [Male Voice] Bop It.

1275
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,294
- Bop It, that's what it was.

1276
00:42:13,294 --> 00:42:14,127
- [Illman] Boppin.

1277
00:42:14,127 --> 00:42:16,886
- [Gary] T-rock's on, guys,
T-rock's having a great day.

1278
00:42:16,886 --> 00:42:17,719
(laughing)

1279
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:18,552
- [Nik] Yeah, definitely, Bop It.

1280
00:42:18,552 --> 00:42:22,310
- Anik, you just came
in here nice and slow.

1281
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,860
- I was told to.

1282
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,062
- Yeah, we know, I'm glad you're here.

1283
00:42:26,062 --> 00:42:26,950
How you doing?

1284
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,000
- I forgot about some of these pics.

1285
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,157
These are good pics.

1286
00:42:29,157 --> 00:42:30,410
- [Gary] You got some good stuff, see?

1287
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:31,243
- Yeah.

1288
00:42:31,243 --> 00:42:32,076
- [Gary] You got some recalls.

1289
00:42:32,076 --> 00:42:34,440
- It's not every day you go
through your entire feed.

1290
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,273
- [Gary] Yes.

1291
00:42:35,273 --> 00:42:37,400
- You know what's cool
about Instagram, too?

1292
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,020
And especially successful
people, you get to see

1293
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,910
where that cut-off point was
of, oh they got money now.

1294
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:43,743
(laughing)

1295
00:42:43,743 --> 00:42:44,576
You know what I mean?

1296
00:42:44,576 --> 00:42:47,549
- Why, are you wearing
garbage cans on your head?

1297
00:42:47,549 --> 00:42:48,382
(laughing)

1298
00:42:48,382 --> 00:42:49,215
- I'm still very poor.

1299
00:42:50,492 --> 00:42:52,360
Mom's basement.

1300
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,799
- Illmind, what about
your favorite toy of all--

1301
00:42:54,799 --> 00:42:55,660
- [Illmind] Growing up?

1302
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,530
- Yeah, of all time.

1303
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:59,350
- Shit, it must have
been a Star Wars thing,

1304
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,530
like a Star Wars toy.

1305
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:02,166
- [Gary] How old are you?
- I'm 35.

1306
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:03,820
- [Gary] Got it.
- Yeah, so some kind of Star--

1307
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,810
- [Gary] Return of the Jedi?

1308
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:06,480
- Star Wars was before my time, too.

1309
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,340
- I know, was Return of the Jedi your jam?

1310
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,173
Were you there for that?

1311
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:10,900
- [Illmind] No.
- What year were you born?

1312
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,600
- [Illmind] It was 80,
I don't even remember.

1313
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,883
- You do not know your birth year, bro?

1314
00:43:15,883 --> 00:43:16,716
- [Hannah] You were born in--

1315
00:43:16,716 --> 00:43:17,820
- '82, '82.

1316
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,280
- [Hannah] '82, yeah, because
my brother's the same age.

1317
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,824
- What the fuck was that?

1318
00:43:20,824 --> 00:43:24,255
I've never seen, guys, this
was, forget about me and Oprah,

1319
00:43:24,255 --> 00:43:26,390
that was the, I've never seen that before.

1320
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:29,630
I've never seen somebody
struggle so hard, at least

1321
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:32,591
that wasn't in their 90s,
of what year they were born.

1322
00:43:32,591 --> 00:43:34,870
Have you gotten to your first photo?

1323
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:36,670
- I'm so close.

1324
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:37,539
I'm so close.

1325
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:38,480
- [Hannah] I feel like I'm close, too.

1326
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,970
- Hannah, what is your
favorite all-time toy as a kid?

1327
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:46,170
- I don't know, I don't
think I played with toys.

1328
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:47,003
- [Gary] Really?

1329
00:43:47,003 --> 00:43:50,620
- I mean, I played a lot of
video games when I was a kid.

1330
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:55,570
I loved like that, I can't
even believe I'm saying this,

1331
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:59,380
but I loved that terrible
Sega game, Echo the Dolphin.

1332
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,820
- Oh, I loved Echo the Dolphin!

1333
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:01,653
- [Gary] That game is terrible.

1334
00:44:01,653 --> 00:44:04,050
- It was so bad, but I did love it, too.

1335
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:04,883
I don't know.

1336
00:44:04,883 --> 00:44:06,350
- Oh you know, what, I'm
gonna change my answer.

1337
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,631
My shit was video games,
I'm a video game--

1338
00:44:08,631 --> 00:44:09,646
- I also really loved Sonic the Hedgehog.

1339
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:11,087
- [Gary] Don't fucking
steal Hannah's answer, bro.

1340
00:44:11,087 --> 00:44:12,320
- [Illmind] No, that just reminded me.

1341
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,339
- You're just stealing her shit.

1342
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:14,309
- [Illmind] Sonic was my shit.

1343
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:15,430
- But I also, I was a dancer,

1344
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:17,370
so my favorite thing were my dance shoes.

1345
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:18,203
- [Illman] Earthworm Jim?

1346
00:44:18,203 --> 00:44:19,690
- Yeah, I was kind of the same way.

1347
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:22,900
I was gonna just say basketball
or I loved basketball shoes,

1348
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,419
like Jordans growing up, I loved shoes.

1349
00:44:24,419 --> 00:44:26,900
- You know I never owned a pair
of Jordans in my entire life

1350
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,260
because I hate him with
all my fucking heart?

1351
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,093
- [Nik] Why?

1352
00:44:29,093 --> 00:44:30,780
- Because I'm a Knicks fan and
any real fucking Knicks fan

1353
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,960
hates Michael fucking Jordan.
(clapping)

1354
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,710
- But you respect the greatness, though?

1355
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:34,543
- [Gary] Of course.

1356
00:44:34,543 --> 00:44:35,990
- Of course, but Patrick
Ewing, by the way,

1357
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:38,837
you didn't ask me who my
favorite sports' person was,

1358
00:44:38,837 --> 00:44:40,341
I don't know if that was just a gender?

1359
00:44:40,341 --> 00:44:42,132
(laughing)

1360
00:44:42,132 --> 00:44:43,650
- When did we do favorite sports?

1361
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,260
- You asked Nik who his favorite sports--

1362
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,873
- Yeah, I was making it
contextual to his world.

1363
00:44:46,873 --> 00:44:47,706
- Well, anyway--

1364
00:44:47,706 --> 00:44:48,539
- He's a basketball player.

1365
00:44:48,539 --> 00:44:50,000
- Mine was Patrick Ewing
because I'm a Knicks fan.

1366
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,833
- [Gary] I love you for that.

1367
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:51,666
- [Illman] Wait was your--

1368
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:53,410
- Patrick Ewing is my
favorite all-time player.

1369
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:54,243
- He's the best.

1370
00:44:54,243 --> 00:44:56,720
By the way, I saw Kembe
Mutombo once in a club,

1371
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,030
and I tried to take a photo
of him, and guess what--

1372
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:58,863
- And he did the finger?

1373
00:44:58,863 --> 00:44:59,710
He did the finger!

1374
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:01,603
No, did Kembe fi--, did the finger?

1375
00:45:01,603 --> 00:45:02,436
I almost went (laughing).

1376
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:04,648
- [Hannah] I know you,
yeah, no, no, no, but yes.

1377
00:45:04,648 --> 00:45:05,746
- [Nik] No, no, no.

1378
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:07,770
- Guys, get to your fucking first photo!

1379
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:08,603
- [Illmind] I'm almost
there, I have a New York--

1380
00:45:08,603 --> 00:45:10,017
- You've been saying "almost" for years.

1381
00:45:10,017 --> 00:45:11,576
- [Illmind] I have a New
York Knicks flex moment.

1382
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:14,193
- I like it that Nik had
eight photos on Instagram.

1383
00:45:14,193 --> 00:45:15,692
- I have a New York Knicks flex moment.

1384
00:45:15,692 --> 00:45:17,890
I wanna, fuck this, I'm doing it.

1385
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:19,425
Anthony Mason's son--

1386
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,870
- [Gary] Oh, Anthony Mason Jr.

1387
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:25,010
- So I was at A3C in Atlanta,
and I shared an elevator

1388
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:26,570
with Anthony Mason.

1389
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:28,240
- [Gary] Senior?
- Senior.

1390
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,890
And he said that his son is a fan of mine,

1391
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:32,723
listens to my beats.

1392
00:45:32,723 --> 00:45:33,556
- [Gary] That's fucking cool.

1393
00:45:33,556 --> 00:45:34,454
- Whoa, that's amazing.

1394
00:45:34,454 --> 00:45:37,737
- I was like, am I in the
elevator with Ant Mason right now?

1395
00:45:37,737 --> 00:45:39,900
- I have also another
little sports situation.

1396
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,380
My uncle, Lou, started the Gouchos.

1397
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,309
- Oh, I used to play against
Gouchos all the time.

1398
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:46,606
- You did?
- Yeah.

1399
00:45:46,606 --> 00:45:48,292
- And did you beat their faces?

1400
00:45:48,292 --> 00:45:50,845
- I dropped like 35 on them
one time in Pittsburgh.

1401
00:45:50,845 --> 00:45:51,678
- [Gary] Alright, Ill?

1402
00:45:51,678 --> 00:45:55,700
- Alright, August 31st, 2011.

1403
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:59,438
It's a picture of, what is it?

1404
00:45:59,438 --> 00:46:00,404
What's his name?
- [Gary] Where's mine?

1405
00:46:00,404 --> 00:46:01,895
He fucking quit, Tyler, wait a minute.

1406
00:46:01,895 --> 00:46:02,960
- [Male Voice] It's 5:04.

1407
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,390
- I don't give a fuck if
it's fucking midnight,

1408
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,030
I asked you to get to the first photo.

1409
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,958
You gave up like two seconds.

1410
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:08,875
- Got mine!

1411
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,820
- [Nik] Oh, we got both at the same time.

1412
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,003
- I'm so happy everybody
has theirs, but mine

1413
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:17,140
because Tyler, who's supposed to help me

1414
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,943
in situations like this literally

1415
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:21,210
just disregarded my request.

1416
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,350
I asked nicely.

1417
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:23,270
I asked nicely.

1418
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:24,410
- [Hannah] What are we looking at here?

1419
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:25,750
- [Illmind] Mine's a picture
of a Harry Potter wand.

1420
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,010
It's a Harry Potter wand.

1421
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:29,250
- [Gary] You are a straight nerd.

1422
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,400
- [Illmind] I told you I was a nerd.

1423
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,680
- [Gary] Five Likes, two comments.

1424
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,513
- [Illmind] What'd they say?

1425
00:46:33,513 --> 00:46:34,406
What were the comments?

1426
00:46:34,406 --> 00:46:35,239
(laughing)

1427
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:36,816
- The comments were "You fucking nerd."

1428
00:46:36,816 --> 00:46:37,649
(laughing)

1429
00:46:37,649 --> 00:46:39,340
No, I'm just kidding.

1430
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,840
Guys, the first comment is,
"Yo, I'm a half Filipino kid

1431
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,820
"from Bloomfield who manages, got some."

1432
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,560
- [Illmind] Hey, kid,
that's where I'm from.

1433
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,393
Swag.

1434
00:46:48,393 --> 00:46:49,760
- [Gary] Hannah?

1435
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,290
- I told you it was
gonna be anticlimactic.

1436
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:55,520
- Hannah's is 27 Likes, one
comment, January 5th, 2012.

1437
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,490
It's fireworks.

1438
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:57,460
- [Hannah] It was from New Year's Eve.

1439
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:00,750
- And the one comment is, "I
hope my first and only wife

1440
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,940
"looks something like you
because then I wouldn't have

1441
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,470
"problems doing anything it takes

1442
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:07,013
"to keep her happy, kicksagram."

1443
00:47:07,013 --> 00:47:07,846
There you go.

1444
00:47:07,846 --> 00:47:08,928
All these pervy dudes.

1445
00:47:08,928 --> 00:47:09,761
- Whoa.

1446
00:47:10,647 --> 00:47:12,620
- That's calm on, thank God, for--

1447
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,200
- That's 318 weeks ago.

1448
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,070
- [Gary] Just like yesterday.

1449
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:17,730
- This, I should have started with this.

1450
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,360
This was the second post.

1451
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,390
Me in the studio.

1452
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:21,688
That was the proper one.

1453
00:47:21,688 --> 00:47:23,204
- But that's not how it works out.

1454
00:47:23,204 --> 00:47:24,621
That's not ever how it works out.

1455
00:47:24,621 --> 00:47:25,890
- [Illman] I'm deleting
the Harry Potter one.

1456
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:27,130
- I cannot wait to see
those photos on Twitter.

1457
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:30,440
Guys, remember, what was
the hashtag, #GVinsta?

1458
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,273
- [Hannah] #GVfirst--

1459
00:47:31,273 --> 00:47:34,200
- Oh no, it's #firstinstaGV?

1460
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,060
- No, #GVfirstIG.

1461
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:38,650
- #GVfirstIG, okay, thank you guys.

1462
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,580
Which is why you guys got
good grades and I didn't.

1463
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:45,020
- When you look back at the
early days of your Instagram,

1464
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:47,710
I'm like, what was I even up to?

1465
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,880
- You were not up to the
things you're up to now.

1466
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,040
That's what's up.

1467
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,450
- Except for still killing
the nail art game, though.

1468
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:53,283
Let's get real.

1469
00:47:53,283 --> 00:47:54,770
- [Gary] Yeah, you were,
that's really good, actually.

1470
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,021
- Been on that early.

1471
00:47:56,021 --> 00:47:57,240
- [Nik] You were up on that.

1472
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,134
- Since the 90s?

1473
00:47:58,134 --> 00:47:59,652
- [Hannah] You know.

1474
00:47:59,652 --> 00:48:01,410
- Guys, I really appreciate having you on.

1475
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:05,210
Last parting words for the
audience, what do you got to say?

1476
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:06,043
Hannah?

1477
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,660
- Last parting words for the audience.

1478
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,360
- Anything you want, questions,
statements, inspirations,

1479
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,950
demotivations, whatever you roll with.

1480
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,560
- I don't know, do what
makes you feel good.

1481
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:21,890
- [Gary] Good, I like that.

1482
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:22,723
Nik?

1483
00:48:22,723 --> 00:48:25,330
- Be great, perfect your craft, I think.

1484
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,300
For me, that's what motivates me.

1485
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,100
Every day I just look at
guys that are the best

1486
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,130
in their sport or their profession.

1487
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:34,480
I look at guys like Tom
Brady in the Superbowl.

1488
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,650
- Dude, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1489
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,708
We don't talk, we don't mention that.

1490
00:48:40,708 --> 00:48:41,660
- [Hannah] I knew this was
gonna go there (laughs)

1491
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:42,800
as soon as you just said that.

1492
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,221
- [Gary] Dude, our friendship
just took a huge setback.

1493
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:46,574
- I'm so, so sorry.

1494
00:48:46,574 --> 00:48:47,407
I'm--

1495
00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:49,630
- I'm literally looking at
you with a huge Jets logo

1496
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:52,320
over your head, no, no,
above it, see it right there?

1497
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,153
This is my angle.

1498
00:48:53,153 --> 00:48:54,080
- [Nik] Oh yeah.

1499
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,849
- Know how I talked about
the Jordan thing earlier?

1500
00:48:56,849 --> 00:48:57,682
- Yeah.

1501
00:48:57,682 --> 00:49:01,340
- Brady's on some more current
feeling shit, you know?

1502
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:02,740
So, no.

1503
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,660
Okay, say somebody else.

1504
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,534
Pick somebody else.

1505
00:49:04,534 --> 00:49:05,367
(laughing)

1506
00:49:05,367 --> 00:49:07,480
- I mean, even someone
like Floyd Mayweather.

1507
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,862
- [Gary] No, no, I'm just
kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1508
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,031
- A guy like Floyd Mayweather.

1509
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:12,360
He's just all about perfecting his craft.

1510
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,746
He's just obsessed, every day,

1511
00:49:13,746 --> 00:49:15,830
whether it's three in the
morning, four in the morning.

1512
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:16,663
He just goes to the gym.

1513
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:17,750
He's like, "I want to be the best ever."

1514
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,410
And he's 50 and 0 because of it.

1515
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:20,800
So, be great.

1516
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,633
Do what you do.

1517
00:49:21,633 --> 00:49:22,466
- [Gary] Love it, Illmind?

1518
00:49:22,466 --> 00:49:24,620
- I would say, man,
just try a bunch of shit

1519
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:27,890
until you find something
you're obsessed with doing,

1520
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:29,300
and then just do it everyday.

1521
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,980
- Yes, guys, I really appreciate you.

1522
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:31,813
Have a great weekend.

1523
00:49:31,813 --> 00:49:32,646
- [Nik] Appreciate you.

1524
00:49:32,646 --> 00:49:34,620
- [Hannah] Thank you
so much for having me.

1525
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,453
- You got it?

1526
00:49:35,453 --> 00:49:37,940
Wait, that was actually
unbelievable timing.

1527
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,850
Tyler, you actually did
