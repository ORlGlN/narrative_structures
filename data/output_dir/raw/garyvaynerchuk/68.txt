1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,862
- Just grinding like an operator.

2
00:00:02,862 --> 00:00:04,528
We need to do something with

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:06,287
the operator thing, like a surgeon.

4
00:00:06,287 --> 00:00:07,364
I like that.

5
00:00:07,364 --> 00:00:10,364
(upbeat bass music)

6
00:00:13,856 --> 00:00:17,263
(light electronic music)

7
00:00:17,263 --> 00:00:20,313
- Where it gets really
interesting is culture.

8
00:00:20,313 --> 00:00:24,552
Culture is the hidden retention of it all.

9
00:00:24,552 --> 00:00:26,025
It's been really fascinating for me

10
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:29,350
to watch people, and it makes sense,

11
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,641
pick happiness over finance.

12
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:35,808
Even in their 20's, or maybe
especially in their 20's.

13
00:00:36,956 --> 00:00:40,335
Literally the conversation
I was just having outside.

14
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:43,342
We've gone through a heavy,

15
00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:46,092
kind of a very entry-level model.

16
00:00:48,362 --> 00:00:50,810
We are building almost like a dumbbell,

17
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,619
going very heavy up top,

18
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,645
going incredibly systematic at the bottom,

19
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:58,532
and being very scrutinizing our middle,

20
00:00:58,532 --> 00:01:00,917
where there's a enormous hidden garbage.

21
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:02,321
Be at the mercy of the individual

22
00:01:02,321 --> 00:01:05,385
instead of creating, Vince
McMahon did it right, right?

23
00:01:05,385 --> 00:01:08,339
He's gonna bring you
in, he's gonna name you,

24
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:10,036
he now owns that name.

25
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:12,151
You're not Brutus the Barber Beefcake.

26
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:14,286
You're not Hillbilly Jim.

27
00:01:14,286 --> 00:01:17,515
And then, Babble will tell you up,

28
00:01:17,515 --> 00:01:20,365
that's kind of what I've done for my team.

29
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:22,752
I've built such a brand that it's hard.

30
00:01:22,752 --> 00:01:25,167
I like them, they're
good, there's continuity.

31
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:26,882
But it's hard for me.

32
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:29,532
It's a little hard cause I'm
a human, it's a small team.

33
00:01:29,532 --> 00:01:30,673
But as a business model,

34
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,885
it's what I want to replicate

35
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:34,911
because I don't know,
there's 1000 people lined up

36
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:36,994
willing to work for free.

37
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:40,759
- If we change the laces.

38
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,588
I think there might be
regular laces in there.

39
00:01:42,588 --> 00:01:43,421
- Yeah.

40
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,290
- This is, the box looks great.

41
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,167
- Yeah, it's going to be really fun.

42
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:50,334
How are you?

43
00:01:50,334 --> 00:01:51,324
- I'm excellent.
- Great man.

44
00:01:51,324 --> 00:01:52,781
What's been going on?

45
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:54,195
- Just trying to get the year in here.

46
00:01:54,195 --> 00:01:55,294
- How's it ending?

47
00:01:55,294 --> 00:01:59,123
No, I feel like I'm talking
to Brandon or my brother.

48
00:01:59,123 --> 00:01:59,956
- Yeah, no, no.

49
00:01:59,956 --> 00:02:03,047
- Listen, but that's why I'm
thinking about every variable.

50
00:02:03,047 --> 00:02:04,762
So I'm thinking, okay, there's the,

51
00:02:04,762 --> 00:02:07,147
you know, to your point,
there's something I've,

52
00:02:07,147 --> 00:02:09,645
You've gotten to know me a little bit.

53
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:11,633
The thing that I'm worried about is,

54
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:14,619
I sabotage relationships
because I give so much.

55
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:16,568
I do the wrong thing.

56
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:19,755
I do the right thing so
much that I get upset

57
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:21,356
and then I do the wrong thing.

58
00:02:21,356 --> 00:02:23,948
Scarcity versus volume.

59
00:02:23,948 --> 00:02:28,113
All it is is a supply
and demand game, right?

60
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:29,080
So let's talk about this.

61
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,330
When does the 003 come out?

62
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:36,918
Okay, make some note,
well, somebody, yeah,

63
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:38,212
you make some notes.

64
00:02:38,212 --> 00:02:39,045
- (Gary) What up vlog?

65
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:42,001
Dealing a little bit of a
fire right now with a client.

66
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:43,072
I'm gonna call in two minutes,

67
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,822
just had my K-Swiss 2018 meeting.

68
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,081
Had another meeting about some possible

69
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:50,927
business partnerships.

70
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:54,528
Heading to the LA office now,
a bunch of meetings there.

71
00:02:54,528 --> 00:02:56,897
Then heading to airport,
heading to London,

72
00:02:56,897 --> 00:03:00,884
for the holiday party and
some business meetings there.

73
00:03:00,884 --> 00:03:05,051
Just a little LA, London combo
here to wrap up the year.

74
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:10,674
And here with my main man
Babbin, and that's it.

75
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:13,810
And when you say connecting,

76
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,892
I'll fucking fly in and fly out

77
00:03:15,892 --> 00:03:17,796
to have a breakfast, lunch, and dinner

78
00:03:17,796 --> 00:03:20,515
because, again, I need
you guys to know this.

79
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:23,595
This is more about how I
feel about myself as a man,

80
00:03:23,595 --> 00:03:26,897
than about the size of the
financial vulnerability.

81
00:03:26,897 --> 00:03:28,075
- I'm sorry--
- It's a pleasure.

82
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,011
- You're busy.
- How are you?

83
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,195
- Good.
- Good to see you.

84
00:03:30,195 --> 00:03:32,140
- Thank you, I have
operations associates out.

85
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,281
- It's a pleasure.
- Great to meet you.

86
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,347
- (Gary) I love the Eagles gear.

87
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,180
(woman laughing)
- (Woman) Thanks.

88
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,055
- (Gary) Sorry about Carson.

89
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:37,501
- (Woman) I know, it's horrible.

90
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:38,334
- (Gary) Hey guys, happy holidays.

91
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:39,810
- (Many) Hey Gary.

92
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,643
Hey guys.
- (Woman) Hey.

93
00:03:40,643 --> 00:03:42,309
Hi. Hi.

94
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:43,255
Hi Lauren.
- How are you?

95
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:44,112
- (Gary) How are you?
- Good to see you.

96
00:03:44,112 --> 00:03:45,095
- (Gary) Good to see you.

97
00:03:45,095 --> 00:03:46,056
- Just coming in?
- Just coming in.

98
00:03:46,056 --> 00:03:46,889
- How was your flight?

99
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:49,800
- (Man) It was good, it was
last night, pretty good.

100
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,306
- (Gary) What up Instagram?

101
00:03:52,306 --> 00:03:54,542
I wanted to jump on and
say, "Hey, hey, hey."

102
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:55,917
(clearing throat)

103
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:57,516
My voice is a little suspect.

104
00:03:57,516 --> 00:03:59,551
I keep losing it, ignoring this cold.

105
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:01,141
Good to see you.

106
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,044
What up?

107
00:04:02,044 --> 00:04:04,686
People throwing up the five, I like that.

108
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:05,635
Broden Bird, good to see you.

109
00:04:05,635 --> 00:04:07,635
Trinidad James, the man.

110
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:10,974
Thank you Trinidad James.

111
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,982
Headed to London right
now, in the LA office.

112
00:04:15,982 --> 00:04:18,457
Real good, got a lot done.

113
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:21,341
Just grinding, like an operator.

114
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:22,261
I feel like I'm an op,

115
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:23,693
we need to do something
with the operator thing,

116
00:04:23,693 --> 00:04:25,738
like a surgeon, I like that.

117
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:26,582
Good to see you.

118
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:28,533
Happy holidays to everybody.

119
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:29,930
I see a lot of you getting your thing.

120
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,741
I just posted this video for a lot of you,

121
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:34,491
that you need to see.

122
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,868
- (Gary) and what you want, very easily.

123
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:49,322
You can go and play lacrosse in college.

124
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:53,293
You can try out for major
league lacrosse teams.

125
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,186
You can either succeed or fail,

126
00:04:55,186 --> 00:04:56,470
but I got good news for you.

127
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,995
When you're 27, which is
a ridiculous young man,

128
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:01,969
you can just go get a job.

129
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,087
- (Man) That's true, you can go get a job,

130
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:04,535
but you can never go back, bro.

131
00:05:04,535 --> 00:05:08,014
You can never go back to 21 years old

132
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:10,602
and take that leap of faith.

133
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,217
You're so young, but like plan.

134
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:15,878
But just do it, bro, fuck that.

135
00:05:15,878 --> 00:05:18,295
(chattering)

136
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,244
- (Female) And ladies and gentlemen,

137
00:05:21,244 --> 00:05:22,967
if you're standing by for Washington,

138
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:25,578
our next departure will
leave at two o'clock.

139
00:05:25,578 --> 00:05:27,442
It should be leaving out of C41,

140
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:31,292
so if you wanna get over
to C41 and remain seated,

141
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:33,010
we'll hopefully be able to help you

142
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,482
(ding)

143
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:37,149
a little later with those seats.

144
00:05:41,017 --> 00:05:44,017
(people chattering)

145
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:55,335
(ding)

146
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:02,338
(people chattering)

147
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:21,334
(ding)

148
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:25,642
(people chattering)

149
00:06:27,555 --> 00:00:00,000
(mellow music)
