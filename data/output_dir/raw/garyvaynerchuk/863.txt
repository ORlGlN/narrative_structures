00:00:00,177 --> 00:00:01,436
("The Best" by Tina Turner)
- Alrighty,

2
00:00:01,436 --> 00:00:02,168
ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,504
boys and girls, we're here.

4
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,089
If you know who's 
about to come out stage,

5
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,044
I know you're excited.

6
00:00:07,044 --> 00:00:08,985
He's one of the hottest speakers

7
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:10,428
on the planet right now.

8
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:11,566
Just like what we do here,

9
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:13,417
this man builds businesses.

10
00:00:13,417 --> 00:00:15,896
Fresh out of college, 
took his family wine

11
00:00:15,896 --> 00:00:17,704
business from three million

12
00:00:17,704 --> 00:00:21,605
to 60 million, in less
than four or five years.

13
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,230
Along the way, 
he's become an incredibly

14
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,298
successful venture
capitalist, an angel investor,

15
00:00:26,298 --> 00:00:27,844
invested in a couple 
of small companies

16
00:00:27,844 --> 00:00:28,733
you may have heard of,

17
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:31,888
called Facebook 
and Twitter, and Uber.

18
00:00:31,888 --> 00:00:33,330
He's got a brand new book coming out

19
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,890
very soon, it's called #AskGaryVee,

20
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,881
because he is Gary Vee.

21
00:00:37,881 --> 00:00:39,060
Ladies and gentlemen, please be

22
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,766
on your feet and welcome to the stage,

23
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:43,083
the last speaker for ICON 2016,

24
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:46,130
give it up for Gary Vaynerchuk.

25
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,070
(audience cheers and applauds)

26
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,351
Gary Vee!

27
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:49,671
(energetic rap music)

28
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:53,380
Gary Vee!

29
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,812
(laughs)

30
00:00:57,386 --> 00:00:58,739
(speaker is drowned out by loud music)

31
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,609
- Thank you so much.

32
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:06,605
Thank you!

33
00:01:10,074 --> 00:01:11,487
Thank you!

34
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:13,851
Thank you so much!

35
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:16,559
So, (audience member cheers).

36
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:17,595
Thank you!

37
00:01:17,595 --> 00:01:18,631
How's everybody?

38
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:19,749
(audience cheers)

39
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:21,415
Awesome.

40
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,817
Couple things,

41
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:25,560
first, I was asked very politely

42
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,294
not to curse, so they'll
be no cursing. (laughter)

43
00:01:28,294 --> 00:01:30,021
(audience boos)

44
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:32,479
It's just the truth.

45
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,003
Second of all, because I wanna figure out

46
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:35,242
where I wanna take this talk,

47
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:38,087
based on the crowd,

48
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:40,159
how many people in this room

49
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,683
don't know who I am and don't have

50
00:01:41,683 --> 00:01:43,003
a good feel for my spiel?

51
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:45,229
Please raise your hand.

52
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:48,927
Alright, that hurts. (laughter)

53
00:01:48,927 --> 00:01:49,597
Makes sense.

54
00:01:49,597 --> 00:01:51,092
Alright, so I'm gonna go very quickly,

55
00:01:51,092 --> 00:01:53,124
since it's not that big of a percentage,

56
00:01:53,124 --> 00:01:55,298
then I'm gonna go into my spiel,

57
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:57,899
and then I honestly wanna go into Q and A,

58
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,174
as quickly as possible, because I think

59
00:02:00,174 --> 00:02:02,125
70% of you have heard a lot of this,

60
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,011
the 30% of you are gonna enjoy it,

61
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:05,596
but I think if we can go into

62
00:02:05,596 --> 00:02:07,933
the context and the details,

63
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:09,036
it'll be far greater.

64
00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:11,955
So, actually, I'm gonna go
with a very short version

65
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:14,129
of it, 'cause there
wasn't that many hands.

66
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:15,917
I was born in the Soviet Union,

67
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:17,380
so I grew up an immigrant.

68
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,229
What that means is,

69
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:20,947
how many people here
were not born in America?

70
00:02:20,947 --> 00:02:22,218
Raise your hand.

71
00:02:22,218 --> 00:02:24,270
Wow, let's clap it up for the immigrants

72
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,103
in the house.

73
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:25,875
(audience cheers)

74
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:26,638
I like that.

75
00:02:26,638 --> 00:02:28,061
Oh actually this is very international,

76
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:29,036
you flew in, you don't live here,

77
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:30,418
got it, sorry, I screwed up.

78
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:34,298
Okay, so, I grew up very poor,

79
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:37,143
I lived in a studio apartment
with eight family members,

80
00:02:37,143 --> 00:02:38,565
so I've got grit, right?

81
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:39,784
Like, I'm not scared to work,

82
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,901
I think one of the biggest problems

83
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:42,466
right now, is we're living through

84
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:45,556
one of the great generations
of fake entrepreneurship,

85
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:46,814
because so many people are able

86
00:02:46,814 --> 00:02:49,376
to raise money, and so you've got,

87
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:50,741
you just have people 
that are not supposed

88
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:52,491
to be running businesses,
running businesses,

89
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:53,789
'cause there was so much capital

90
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:55,141
for the last seven or eight years,

91
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,396
and that's interesting for me to watch,

92
00:02:57,396 --> 00:02:59,286
though the stuff is
starting to hit the fan,

93
00:02:59,286 --> 00:03:01,541
so, that will play itself out.

94
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,365
I was a hustler, I know
stuff, I know, (laughter)

95
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:07,331
I was a hustler from the get,

96
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:10,623
I was lemonade stand, baseball cards,

97
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:14,828
all that stuff, so I was
really a salesperson,

98
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,860
through and through.

99
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,639
When I was 12, I was making two

100
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,840
to $3,000 a weekend,
selling baseball cards

101
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,669
in the malls of New Jersey,

102
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:24,655
and I don't know about you guys,

103
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:29,187
but when you have $30,000 in cash,

104
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:33,007
under your bed, and you're 14 years old,

105
00:03:33,007 --> 00:03:34,836
and you're not selling weed,

106
00:03:34,836 --> 00:03:35,953
you're doing a good job.

107
00:03:35,953 --> 00:03:37,204
(laughter and applause)

108
00:03:37,204 --> 00:03:40,623
So, that was me.

109
00:03:41,897 --> 00:03:43,624
My dad dragged me into the liquor store

110
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:47,232
that he now owned, he was
making two bucks an hour

111
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:48,471
as a stockboy, when he first came

112
00:03:48,471 --> 00:03:49,974
to America, so you can imagine

113
00:03:49,974 --> 00:03:54,322
how much my parents are
very much my heroes.

114
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:56,557
He owned a small store,
really not much bigger

115
00:03:56,557 --> 00:03:58,471
than the stage I'm on, it
was a 400 square foot store,

116
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,189
then he built it up, made it bigger,

117
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:02,302
I was dragged into it. 
I hated it.

118
00:04:02,302 --> 00:04:04,131
It was not fun for me,

119
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:07,565
I'd bagged ice for 15 hours a day,

120
00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:08,702
I was in the basement.

121
00:04:08,702 --> 00:04:09,617
How many people here have seen

122
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,384
the movie Goonies?

123
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,657
Raise your hand. (audience cheers)

124
00:04:12,657 --> 00:04:14,741
I literally like was Sloth

125
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:16,265
for like three years. (laughter)

126
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:18,398
I was basically chained to the basement

127
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:21,812
of my dad's liquor store. It sucked.

128
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:23,336
Finally I was allowed upstairs

129
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:26,476
and I realized that people collected wine

130
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:28,163
and that was my connection to the world

131
00:04:28,163 --> 00:04:30,235
I came from, with baseball cards

132
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:32,632
and things of that
nature, and that started

133
00:04:32,632 --> 00:04:36,472
kind of my interest
into my dad's business.

134
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:38,707
'Cause at that point I was
a punk entrepreneur kid,

135
00:04:38,707 --> 00:04:40,965
I thought I could run the
business better than my dad,

136
00:04:40,965 --> 00:04:43,464
but I wasn't interested in
selling Coors Light and Absolut,

137
00:04:43,464 --> 00:04:45,110
but this wine thing was interesting,

138
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,491
and it felt like the marketing thing

139
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:48,543
that I couldn't define at that point,

140
00:04:48,543 --> 00:04:50,569
storytelling, bullcrapping,
whatever you want to call it,

141
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:52,745
like, I couldn't figure out what I was,

142
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:54,330
but I knew I was somethin',

143
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,077
and I knew that it wasn't interesting

144
00:04:56,077 --> 00:04:57,549
to deploy that against Coors Light

145
00:04:57,549 --> 00:04:58,683
or an Absolut, but the wine thing,

146
00:04:58,683 --> 00:05:00,227
most people didn't understand,

147
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:02,157
there was an opportunity to really market.

148
00:05:02,157 --> 00:05:04,839
So I, from 17 to 18 years old,

149
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,297
16 to 18 years old, I
probably learned more

150
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:09,492
about wine than most
people should ever learn

151
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:12,620
in their lives, I was a terrible student,

152
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,201
I started getting F's in fourth grade,

153
00:05:15,201 --> 00:05:18,228
I punted it very early in my life.

154
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:20,463
I would tell you that I
if could wish anything

155
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:22,556
for everybody in this
conference right now,

156
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,100
if I could actually wish you anything

157
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,050
besides health, that would be number one,

158
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,712
but if I could wish you
anything besides health,

159
00:05:28,712 --> 00:05:30,865
I would wish you self-awareness.

160
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:34,096
I truly believe that
self-awareness (audience applauds),

161
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:36,534
I truly believe that
self-awareness is a big deal

162
00:05:36,534 --> 00:05:39,623
and my self-awareness
was extreme as a kid,

163
00:05:39,623 --> 00:05:41,575
and I just knew who I was,

164
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:42,853
and even though the market.

165
00:05:42,853 --> 00:05:44,945
Don't forget, I was an immigrant,

166
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,408
so the way out for immigrants

167
00:05:46,408 --> 00:05:48,706
in America, for a lot of you
that don't know, is education,

168
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:49,835
they push it hard.
(audience member shouts)

169
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:52,273
So all my friends, my parents' friends

170
00:05:52,273 --> 00:05:54,589
were pushing education,
all the other Russian kids

171
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:56,885
went to Yale, and if
they were like a loser

172
00:05:56,885 --> 00:05:58,287
they went to NYU. (laughter)

173
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:01,477
I was like getting F's, but my parents

174
00:06:01,477 --> 00:06:03,305
supported my entrepreneurship,

175
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:04,402
but more importantly than that,

176
00:06:04,402 --> 00:06:06,007
I was gifted, 'cause I really,

177
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:08,100
I'm trying to figure out how to teach it

178
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,477
or elevate it, because it's a big deal,

179
00:06:10,477 --> 00:06:11,900
but I was gifted with self-awareness

180
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,597
by 12 or 13, even though
all my friends' parents

181
00:06:15,597 --> 00:06:18,828
told me I was a loser, 'cause
I was failling classes,

182
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:21,591
even though my teachers said that,

183
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:23,948
I knew, I knew because
I was making a crapload

184
00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:26,519
of cash every weekend (laughter).

185
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,490
But I also knew because
I just could taste it,

186
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,770
I knew who I was.

187
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,213
So, anyway, I got involved

188
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:33,610
in my dad's liquor store,

189
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,764
my plan was not to go to college,

190
00:06:35,764 --> 00:06:37,389
my mom, this is how much my mom

191
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:39,116
didn't know about the education system

192
00:06:39,116 --> 00:06:40,957
in America. My mom came to me

193
00:06:40,957 --> 00:06:45,419
in February of my graduating
year of high school.

194
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:46,990
You know, you're graduating in 90 days

195
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,449
and goes to me, "So what
are we doing about college?"

196
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:51,501
I'm like, I've been doing
a lot of things mom,

197
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:53,675
I'm not going, and then
she punched me in the face

198
00:06:53,675 --> 00:06:56,072
and (laughter), like a
couple of days later I,

199
00:06:56,072 --> 00:06:58,063
this is not a joke, this
is how I went to college,

200
00:06:58,063 --> 00:07:00,136
a couple days later, I got a postcard

201
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:02,432
in the mail from Mount Ida College,

202
00:07:02,432 --> 00:07:04,321
and I filled out my name and address

203
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:06,933
and send it in and that's
how I went to college.

204
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:08,965
So, that fall I went to Mount Ida College

205
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:11,069
in Newton, Mass, I was in my dorm room

206
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:14,340
on a very faithful day,
playing Madden '95,

207
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,367
dominating by the way, (laughter)

208
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:19,318
my boy comes in (chuckles), and says,

209
00:07:19,318 --> 00:07:20,537
"Hey, you gotta come see this,"

210
00:07:20,537 --> 00:07:21,756
I went into a dorm room,

211
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:22,975
there's eight dudes,

212
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,519
they're standing over a computer,

213
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:27,038
I had a word processor for the papers

214
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:28,379
I was supposed to do.

215
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:31,264
So I, at this point, I'm 18 years old,

216
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:34,231
I've spent maybe 30
minutes on the Internet,

217
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:38,396
excuse me, I'm sorry, 30 minutes
on a computer in my life.

218
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:40,834
I'm old, so like that's
how we did it, right?

219
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:43,191
And so, I'm standing in
front of the computer,

220
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:47,254
I understand, at this point
the information super highways

221
00:07:47,254 --> 00:07:50,200
in the news, I hear for the first time

222
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,455
(loud mouth beeping),

223
00:07:52,455 --> 00:07:55,645
is 1994, (laughter) I'm like,

224
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:56,560
is this the Internet?

225
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,018
The information super highway, oh my god!

226
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:03,655
I, eight dudes are standing
over an AOL chatroom

227
00:08:03,655 --> 00:08:07,669
for five hours, I waited three hours

228
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:09,559
for my turn, (laughter)

229
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:12,627
I get on the Internet,
and within seven minutes,

230
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:13,877
and I could barely use a computer,

231
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:18,225
I still can't type,
like, in seven minutes,

232
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:21,171
I'm on a random AOL message board

233
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:24,016
where people are selling
and trading baseball cards.

234
00:08:24,016 --> 00:08:25,946
And within 30 minutes of ever being

235
00:08:25,946 --> 00:08:27,592
on the Internet in 1994,

236
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:30,599
I realized, holy crap, I don't need

237
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,707
to open up 4,000 liquor stores,

238
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:36,206
I'm gonna sell on this thing.

239
00:08:36,206 --> 00:08:37,344
And that's my relationship

240
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:38,400
with the Internet. (audience applauds)

241
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,168
Don't clap, 'cause I didnt' accomplish

242
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:43,674
anything yet, but here
it comes. (laughter)

243
00:08:43,674 --> 00:08:47,067
I figured out, I started
getting super interested,

244
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:48,205
I, like, you know?

245
00:08:48,205 --> 00:08:50,094
When I came back from, we
didn't have cell phones,

246
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:51,882
and you didn't know your
friend's phone numbers

247
00:08:51,882 --> 00:08:53,641
back then, like when I
came back from school

248
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:54,900
that summer, I found a couple nerds

249
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,255
from high school, I was like, yo, nerds,

250
00:08:56,255 --> 00:08:57,210
you know this crap, right?

251
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,571
They're like, "Yeah," I'm like, alright,

252
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,179
like, I went to their
house, they got like a modem

253
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:01,705
in their phone, they're weird as hell,

254
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:03,208
it's in the basement, it's awkward,

255
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,017
but I'm like, this is it.

256
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:07,506
And so (laughter), two years later,

257
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:11,062
I launch the second
e-commerce wine business

258
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:13,459
in America, called winelibrary.com.

259
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:15,857
And so, it's comin', (laughter)

260
00:09:15,857 --> 00:09:19,006
and then in 1998, actually
this is a good story,

261
00:09:19,006 --> 00:09:20,311
this will, you know what?

262
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:21,428
This is a good story for a lot of people

263
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,196
in this room, you know, I've audited

264
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,496
a lot of people in this room,

265
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:26,206
looking at people using the hashtags,

266
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:27,669
I've spoke here three or four years ago,

267
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:29,924
I've got a solid sense of
what's going on in here.

268
00:09:29,924 --> 00:09:31,935
I'm really excited
because this little story

269
00:09:31,935 --> 00:09:33,804
I'm about to tell, actually,

270
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:36,296
I've never said it this way,
Joe Mama, I see you brother.

271
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:37,839
A lot of people have heard this before,

272
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,647
I'm actually gonna tie this in nicely.

273
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:41,720
I would tell you the most
interesting thing for me,

274
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,528
in this room today, is the following,

275
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:46,210
I believe that I'm standing in a room

276
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,135
of non-marketers or brand people.

277
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:50,172
Non!

278
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,919
I think I'm sitting in the room

279
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,721
of transactional salespeople,

280
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:58,150
and by the way, I like that,

281
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,841
just so everybody knows,

282
00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:00,995
I'm not saying that's bad or good,

283
00:10:00,995 --> 00:10:02,823
but I feel that the far majority

284
00:10:02,823 --> 00:10:07,142
of this room are transactioners.

285
00:10:07,142 --> 00:10:10,758
One of the biggest reasons
that there is a stunning

286
00:10:10,758 --> 00:10:13,907
disrespect for social media 
in this room

287
00:10:13,907 --> 00:10:16,122
is because the far 
amount of people here

288
00:10:16,122 --> 00:10:18,377
work on quant and transactions

289
00:10:18,377 --> 00:10:21,750
and data and 
short-term business metrics,

290
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,526
not on brand and marketing,
and long-term business metrics.

291
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:29,066
So, I'm gonna break that
down, (low clapping)

292
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:31,121
thanks back there, one
person was clapping,

293
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:33,275
he's pumped! (laughter)

294
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:35,713
So, (chuckles) this is what happened,

295
00:10:35,713 --> 00:10:37,491
and this is why I launched winelibrary.com

296
00:10:37,491 --> 00:10:39,584
in 1996, just remember.

297
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:41,677
How many people here, over the age of 38?

298
00:10:41,677 --> 00:10:42,794
Raise your hands.

299
00:10:42,794 --> 00:10:43,627
Love it.

300
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:46,167
So, a good portion of you remember

301
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:47,813
what I remember, which was,

302
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,556
and by the way, some of you thought this,

303
00:10:50,556 --> 00:10:52,851
people thought the Internet itself

304
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:56,305
was a fad, not Snapchat or Twitter,

305
00:10:56,305 --> 00:11:00,288
the whole damn thing. (laughter)

306
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:03,356
So, I remember literally giving a talk

307
00:11:03,356 --> 00:11:05,367
in 1996 at the Chamber of Commerce

308
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:07,735
of like, I launched a dot-com,

309
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:09,482
and like people making fun of me,

310
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:11,311
I literally was on a panel with a guy

311
00:11:11,311 --> 00:11:13,912
who sold Yellow Pages, (laughter)

312
00:11:13,912 --> 00:11:15,964
and said that this kid, he said,

313
00:11:15,964 --> 00:11:17,620
in a big crowd, no, small crowd,

314
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,880
but he goes, "How many of you

315
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,436
"in this section, how many of you

316
00:11:20,436 --> 00:11:23,931
"have ever bought or will buy
anything from the Internet?"

317
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:26,226
And nobody raised their hand. (laughter)

318
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:28,075
I'm 22 years old, and he goes,

319
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:30,005
"And this kid is gonna tell you

320
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:33,216
"that you're gonna buy
wine on the Internet."

321
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:35,837
And everybody goes, ha
ha ha ha. (laughter)

322
00:11:35,837 --> 00:11:37,098
So I'm sitting there, this is the part

323
00:11:37,098 --> 00:11:38,622
where I really wish you let me curse,

324
00:11:38,622 --> 00:11:41,507
but, (laughter)

325
00:11:41,507 --> 00:11:44,697
(crowd cheers) so I go,

326
00:11:44,697 --> 00:11:45,530
so I go,

327
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,171
so I go, and this is funny,

328
00:11:48,171 --> 00:11:49,919
and this is interesting
how the world played out,

329
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,367
I said, this is actually my,

330
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:53,455
and I didn't realize how the world

331
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:54,593
was really gonna play out,

332
00:11:54,593 --> 00:11:56,015
I said, you know I really wish

333
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,327
this was being recorded,

334
00:11:57,327 --> 00:11:58,485
is what I said.

335
00:11:58,485 --> 00:11:59,614
I said, because you're gonna be

336
00:11:59,614 --> 00:12:01,730
on the wrong side of history.

337
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,940
The biggest problem and slash

338
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,647
the biggest opportunity to make

339
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:09,247
and lose money is, most people sitting

340
00:12:09,247 --> 00:12:11,563
in this room, just a straight fact,

341
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:14,062
are projecting all their decision-making

342
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:16,135
completely predicated on how the world

343
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,776
is right this second, without projecting

344
00:12:18,776 --> 00:12:22,311
or deploying emerging consumer behaviors.

345
00:12:22,311 --> 00:12:25,657
I, for a fact, stand here today

346
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:28,583
knowing that 20 years from today,

347
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,472
which, depending on
how you think about it,

348
00:12:30,472 --> 00:12:32,221
is a long time or a short time,

349
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:34,456
feels short to me, 'cause I'll see it,

350
00:12:34,456 --> 00:12:35,736
I won't be dead.

351
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:40,003
20 years from today,
everybody in this room

352
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:42,693
will be living in a virtual reality world,

353
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:46,058
and I mean the people in
this room will be sitting

354
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:47,803
at home or whatever the
hell we're living in,

355
00:12:47,803 --> 00:12:49,871
because we're now in a VR world,

356
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:51,050
probably all in San Diego,

357
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,752
'cause it's super nice
there, right? (laughter)

358
00:12:53,752 --> 00:12:58,665
And you will literally
put on contact lenses

359
00:12:58,665 --> 00:13:02,180
or whatever, it's not gonna
be this bullcrap Oculus,

360
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,562
it's gonna be contact lenses

361
00:13:03,562 --> 00:13:05,198
and who knows what could happen in,

362
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:07,569
maybe, you know, LASIK
right into your eyeballs?

363
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:08,991
Right?

364
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,308
And you will sit there, and your brain

365
00:13:11,308 --> 00:13:13,157
will believe what you're seeing

366
00:13:13,157 --> 00:13:16,378
is real, as what's happening right now,

367
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:21,358
98.6%, by the best scientist right now,

368
00:13:21,358 --> 00:13:23,205
you will believe it.

369
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:25,054
So let's take a step back,

370
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,593
in 20 years, you'll sit in a room,

371
00:13:27,593 --> 00:13:28,844
and you will believe everything

372
00:13:28,844 --> 00:13:30,817
that you're seeing, even though
it's not actually happening,

373
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:32,686
'cause we've all now lived life,

374
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,226
and you'll, 98.6% believe it.

375
00:13:35,226 --> 00:13:37,516
There will be a point
in human beings' time,

376
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,426
where what we're doing right now

377
00:13:39,426 --> 00:13:41,153
is gonna be debated as real life,

378
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,652
compared to what's going on there.

379
00:13:43,652 --> 00:13:45,135
If you don't believe that,

380
00:13:45,135 --> 00:13:46,252
then you haven't been paying attention

381
00:13:46,252 --> 00:13:47,900
to how humans are
walking around the world,

382
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,424
looking at their phone all the time,

383
00:13:49,424 --> 00:13:51,070
regardless of situation.

384
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,975
And though it was a social awkward thing

385
00:13:53,975 --> 00:13:55,052
that we pushed against,

386
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:57,319
now the oldest of us are more than happy

387
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:59,208
to do it at all times in public.

388
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:02,723
My friends, the Internet, is the biggest

389
00:14:02,723 --> 00:14:06,238
shift in our lives, ever,

390
00:14:06,238 --> 00:14:08,993
more than the printing
press and caves, ever!

391
00:14:08,993 --> 00:14:11,677
VR is coming and it will
be the next platform.

392
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:13,932
I will probably buy the New York Jets

393
00:14:13,932 --> 00:14:15,619
by my investments in VR,

394
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:18,199
but it's gonna take 20 years, right?

395
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:19,723
It's gonna take 20 years.

396
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:21,490
Right now a lot of people
are investing in it,

397
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,628
and they're gonna lose money,

398
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,847
just like all the people that tried

399
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:25,829
to invest in the Internet in '91, '92,

400
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:29,408
they thought it would
be done by 1995, 1997.

401
00:14:29,408 --> 00:14:30,993
I made those same mistakes,

402
00:14:30,993 --> 00:14:33,065
when I launched winelibrary.com in 1996,

403
00:14:33,065 --> 00:14:38,043
I said, by the year
2000, 50% of my business

404
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,720
is gonna be online!

405
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,402
You know, it's still 33%.

406
00:14:42,402 --> 00:14:43,581
And we were ahead of it,

407
00:14:43,581 --> 00:14:44,698
and really bet on it,

408
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:45,543
so, you know?

409
00:14:45,543 --> 00:14:48,164
And by the way, just to
put things into context,

410
00:14:48,164 --> 00:14:50,886
e-commerce, things we buy and ship,

411
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:55,876
still only represent 15 to 17%
of all commerce in America.

412
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:59,613
All that prime still just adds up to that.

413
00:14:59,613 --> 00:15:02,042
So, things happen faster and sooner,

414
00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:03,891
but what I wanna talk about

415
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:05,821
is why I launched winelibrary.com.

416
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,872
I launched it in 1996,
and the first two years,

417
00:15:08,872 --> 00:15:11,432
that business did about $1,000

418
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:14,093
in sales, in two years.

419
00:15:14,093 --> 00:15:15,841
I was still in school, nobody even knew

420
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:18,443
what a computer was back
at the liquor store,

421
00:15:18,443 --> 00:15:19,805
so it did $1,000.

422
00:15:19,805 --> 00:15:23,116
We paid $15,000 to build it.

423
00:15:23,116 --> 00:15:24,295
I don't know how many of you

424
00:15:24,295 --> 00:15:27,607
have a Soviet father, (laughter)

425
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:29,537
but Sasha Vaynerchuk wasn't happy

426
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:33,693
with that ROI. (laughter)

427
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:35,501
It's the same way so many people

428
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,163
in here, when they talk about Snapchat

429
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:39,707
or other things of that nature,

430
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:43,344
wanna know what the ROI is today.

431
00:15:43,344 --> 00:15:47,773
Winelibrary.com, from 1998 to 2003,

432
00:15:47,773 --> 00:15:49,784
in a five year window helped me grow

433
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:51,410
my dad's business, and
let's break this down,

434
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,909
this was a $3,000,000 a year business,

435
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:57,383
that was making 10% gross profit,

436
00:15:57,383 --> 00:16:02,198
so it was making $300,000
in profit before expenses.

437
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:04,433
Now luckily, Sasha didn't
pay anybody anything

438
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:07,460
so he got to take home
150K or what have you.

439
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,804
And he was investing
and owning the property

440
00:16:08,804 --> 00:16:10,096
and that was his, he made it, right?

441
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:13,297
Came into this country with
two bucks, so, he made it!

442
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:15,756
I grew that business, no cash infusion,

443
00:16:15,756 --> 00:16:19,235
no raising money, 
no M&amp;A, no partnership.

444
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:21,064
With no money, I grew that business

445
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,339
from a three to a 65
million dollar business

446
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,066
in five years. (crowd cheers)

447
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:28,195
I did that on what I wanna talk

448
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,085
to you about today.

449
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:32,092
I guess I put it up in my slide now.

450
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:37,082
I suck crap at 99.9%

451
00:16:37,082 --> 00:16:38,688
of things in my life,

452
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:41,797
I'm crap, I'm bad,

453
00:16:41,797 --> 00:16:42,995
I don't know much.

454
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:44,702
Really, I'm pretty like,

455
00:16:44,702 --> 00:16:47,790
I'm stunningly undereducated,
right? (laughter)

456
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,501
You know what it is?

457
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:49,976
I do have huge EQ,

458
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:51,581
my emotional intelligence
is through the roof,

459
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:53,075
that's why I'm gonna be a billionaire,

460
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:54,741
'cause EQ is more important than IQ.

461
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:56,773
So that's good, but, (crowd cheers)

462
00:16:56,773 --> 00:16:59,394
but, this is the only thing I do.

463
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:00,877
What I, now that I'm 40,

464
00:17:00,877 --> 00:17:02,462
I finally figured out what do I do

465
00:17:02,462 --> 00:17:04,319
for a living, that's what I do.

466
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,786
I, day trade attention.

467
00:17:07,787 --> 00:17:09,146
That's what I do.

468
00:17:09,146 --> 00:17:12,642
So, my career was, I thought e-commerce

469
00:17:12,643 --> 00:17:16,239
was gonna big in 1996, the market didn't,

470
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:19,034
I bought e-commerce, in
essence, follow me here,

471
00:17:19,034 --> 00:17:20,346
I bought, I paid a lot for the site,

472
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:22,762
don't go tactical, go
higher level with me,

473
00:17:22,762 --> 00:17:24,958
I bought into e-commerce,

474
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,906
which meant all my behavior,

475
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:29,346
I didn't try to make more money

476
00:17:29,346 --> 00:17:31,033
and buy a second liquor store,

477
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:32,638
I tried to make a lot of money

478
00:17:32,638 --> 00:17:34,283
and build a website.

479
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:37,940
I bought e-commerce in '96, '97, '98, '99,

480
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,789
when the market didn't believe in it.

481
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:43,772
Then I started and I bought
into email marketing.

482
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:44,672
How many people here have done

483
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:45,765
email marketing in their careers?

484
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,248
Raise your hand. (crowd cheers)

485
00:17:47,248 --> 00:17:48,116
Great!

486
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:53,053
I did, I, in 1996, in mid-1997,

487
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:57,624
I had a 200,000 person email newsletter

488
00:17:57,624 --> 00:17:59,225
for a wine store,

489
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:03,885
that had 91.3% open rates.

490
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:05,006
- [Voiceover] Wow!

491
00:18:05,006 --> 00:18:06,236
- Yeah, and by the way,

492
00:18:06,236 --> 00:18:08,431
I'm not fancy, like, thanks for your wows

493
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:10,343
or whatever, here's why,

494
00:18:10,343 --> 00:18:12,244
I day trade attention.

495
00:18:12,244 --> 00:18:15,478
Nobody else was doing email marketing,

496
00:18:15,478 --> 00:18:17,367
so people, you know, one more time,

497
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:19,683
how many people here are 38 and older?

498
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:20,800
Right, good, we're old in here,

499
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,487
so stick with me (laughter),

500
00:18:22,487 --> 00:18:23,421
you guys remember this,

501
00:18:23,421 --> 00:18:25,209
remember all old dudes and chicks?

502
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:26,672
Remember what you did with email

503
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,216
the first couple years we had it?

504
00:18:28,216 --> 00:18:30,553
We read, (loud clap) youngsters
there's a lot of you, too,

505
00:18:30,553 --> 00:18:33,803
youngsters, we read every
(loud claps) single email

506
00:18:33,803 --> 00:18:35,388
and every word of every email

507
00:18:35,388 --> 00:18:37,745
for four years! (laughter)

508
00:18:37,745 --> 00:18:39,634
Because more than I know that the sun

509
00:18:39,634 --> 00:18:41,301
will come up tomorrow, I know

510
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:44,400
that marketers ruin everything!

511
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,538
(laughter)

512
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:47,529
It's what we do!

513
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:49,805
And it's because we day trade attention.

514
00:18:49,805 --> 00:18:51,056
I started email marketing,

515
00:18:51,056 --> 00:18:53,281
that helped me, as you
can imagine, quite a bit.

516
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:55,560
How many people here have
bought Google AdWords

517
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,380
in their career, believe in that?

518
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,518
Good.

519
00:18:58,518 --> 00:19:01,587
The day it launched, I
bought the word wine,

520
00:19:01,587 --> 00:19:03,579
for five cents a click,
because the minimum

521
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:05,570
wasn't 10 cents yet, and I owned it

522
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,958
for nine and a half months
before anybody bid me up.

523
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,173
Because I was day trading this thing

524
00:19:12,173 --> 00:19:15,119
called Google AdWords while everybody

525
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,532
was talking about what's the ROI,

526
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,083
let me, that's not true.

527
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,347
For the first two years,

528
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:22,423
nobody knew what it was,

529
00:19:22,423 --> 00:19:23,743
they didn't know it existed,

530
00:19:23,743 --> 00:19:27,097
they were still in Yahoo
and freaking askjeeves.com.

531
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:28,188
(laughter)

532
00:19:28,188 --> 00:19:29,326
(chuckles)

533
00:19:29,326 --> 00:19:34,084
So, and then, while people debated,

534
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:36,055
"Does this work, what is this?"

535
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:37,409
I was just doing it, as a matter of fact,

536
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,014
I would tell you the
fundamental biggest mistake

537
00:19:39,014 --> 00:19:41,100
of my career was not spending

538
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,604
all my money on Google AdWords,

539
00:19:42,604 --> 00:19:44,453
the reason Wine Library,

540
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:45,956
you'll like this, Wine Library right now,

541
00:19:45,956 --> 00:19:47,846
for the first time in its existence

542
00:19:47,846 --> 00:19:50,731
under my watch, is spending every dollar

543
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,664
on just one marketing behavior,

544
00:19:52,664 --> 00:19:55,407
only Facebook ads.

545
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:57,703
No Google AdWords, shifting it,

546
00:19:57,703 --> 00:19:59,633
only Facebook, because what I learned

547
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:02,132
from Google in 2002 and 2003,

548
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:03,270
is changing my behavior,

549
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,642
which was, when something
is grossly underpriced

550
00:20:06,642 --> 00:20:09,824
by the market, because
people aren't practitioners.

551
00:20:09,824 --> 00:20:12,546
Do you know how many people in this room

552
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:15,985
have strong public opinions

553
00:20:15,985 --> 00:20:19,236
on Facebook ads, have talked crap

554
00:20:19,236 --> 00:20:21,389
these last three days about Facebook ads

555
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:24,599
and have never run Facebook ads?

556
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:28,150
'Cause that's what 
we have a room full of,

557
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,332
headline readers, 
non-practitioners,

558
00:20:31,332 --> 00:20:34,258
or practitioners in one craft

559
00:20:34,258 --> 00:20:35,863
that has made them money,

560
00:20:35,863 --> 00:20:37,386
so they love it so much,

561
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:40,657
like it's their first
girlfriend (laughter), right?

562
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,750
You get romantic about
how you made your money,

563
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,172
you were good at email marketing,

564
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:46,306
so know you want it 
to be good forever,

565
00:20:46,306 --> 00:20:47,951
you were good at Google AdWords,

566
00:20:47,951 --> 00:20:49,475
so you wanna be good forever,

567
00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:51,365
you were good at affiliate marketing,

568
00:20:51,365 --> 00:20:53,350
so you wanted to be good forever.

569
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,815
But that's not how markets work!

570
00:20:56,815 --> 00:20:58,441
Right, so your affiliate marketing

571
00:20:58,441 --> 00:21:00,594
and Google AdWords and email marketing

572
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,545
disrupted other things.

573
00:21:02,545 --> 00:21:04,963
There were older dudes than you

574
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:08,904
that loved direct mail
and magazine copyrighting

575
00:21:08,904 --> 00:21:11,627
and horsecrap like that. (laughter)

576
00:21:11,627 --> 00:21:12,725
And then you came along,

577
00:21:12,725 --> 00:21:13,609
in your younger years and said,

578
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:14,848
"This Google thing's good."

579
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:16,555
And now you're not happy,

580
00:21:16,555 --> 00:21:17,855
but you refuse to look at data

581
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:20,741
like, oh, I don't know, Google themselves

582
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:23,240
putting out data that Google AdWords

583
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,984
are down 19% in clicking,

584
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:29,707
because we've gotten used to it.

585
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:31,881
Sally, Arkansas, doesn't
go to Google anymore

586
00:21:31,881 --> 00:21:34,217
and click every ad, every time.

587
00:21:34,217 --> 00:21:35,416
Got it?

588
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:39,012
And, by the way, I'll come
back five years from now,

589
00:21:39,012 --> 00:21:42,970
ICON 2021, and be asked

590
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,119
not to curse and (laughter),

591
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,299
and I'll come here and say,

592
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:49,290
you guys are still
spending money on Facebook?

593
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,286
You idiots!

594
00:21:50,286 --> 00:21:53,651
The market is shifted,
because I day trade attention,

595
00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:56,617
I have no romance for any marketing

596
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:58,568
or business behavior and never will,

597
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:01,026
to the day I die, period.

598
00:22:01,026 --> 00:22:05,762
And that's a very important
statement that so few

599
00:22:05,762 --> 00:22:10,129
in this room actually deeply believe.

600
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:13,652
And if you did, then you would never

601
00:22:13,652 --> 00:22:16,014
disrespect anything new that has

602
00:22:16,014 --> 00:22:19,047
150 million

603
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,506
active monthly users,

604
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,578
like Snapchat, because it doesn't

605
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:26,504
have a click-out function,
so you can figure out

606
00:22:26,504 --> 00:22:31,426
what the conversion rate is. 
(laughter)

607
00:22:31,426 --> 00:22:33,977
We are living in two 
very separate worlds,

608
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:37,248
the reason I am 
going to make billions

609
00:22:37,248 --> 00:22:38,955
and have made 
hundreds of millions

610
00:22:38,955 --> 00:22:41,373
and the reason many in
here will make millions

611
00:22:41,373 --> 00:22:44,116
is 'cause there's a
difference between sales

612
00:22:44,116 --> 00:22:47,793
and transactions and 
brand and marketing.

613
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:48,626
Got it?

614
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:50,568
And here, (loud clapping) you're
welcome! (audience cheers)

615
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:53,534
And here's why I'm here, not to say,

616
00:22:53,534 --> 00:22:55,525
oh I'm so cool and I make more than you,

617
00:22:55,525 --> 00:22:56,810
'cause plenty of you
will make more than me,

618
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:00,467
it's not that, it's that
if you just gave an ounce

619
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:02,214
of respect that brand matters,

620
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,941
you know, if you just looked at what

621
00:23:03,941 --> 00:23:05,079
you were wearing right now

622
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:09,224
and realized that's why
you bought it. (laughter)

623
00:23:09,224 --> 00:23:11,560
If you just gave it a little respect,

624
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,044
and you just cut yourself a little bit

625
00:23:13,044 --> 00:23:16,288
out of being just pure math arbitrators,

626
00:23:16,288 --> 00:23:18,767
if you just did that, if you just realized

627
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:20,941
it was in your best financial interest

628
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,826
to take 20% of your moneys and behaviors

629
00:23:23,826 --> 00:23:25,248
and learn new things.

630
00:23:25,248 --> 00:23:27,564
And learn 'em!

631
00:23:27,564 --> 00:23:30,022
You would make so much more success

632
00:23:30,022 --> 00:23:31,729
out of your businesses.

633
00:23:31,729 --> 00:23:33,436
So much more.

634
00:23:33,436 --> 00:23:35,549
Instead of doing the easy route,

635
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:37,967
that has happened time and time again,

636
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:40,892
you're gonna poo-poo the new thing,

637
00:23:40,892 --> 00:23:43,473
there's so much value in figuring out

638
00:23:43,473 --> 00:23:45,748
what's happening on musical.ly,

639
00:23:45,748 --> 00:23:49,896
and After School and Anchor and Peach.

640
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:51,323
Do I spend all my time in that?

641
00:23:51,323 --> 00:23:54,513
No, two, three percent 
but the behaviors

642
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:58,109
that I learned on Socialcam,
which crashed and burned

643
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:00,588
in four minutes, were the foundation

644
00:24:00,588 --> 00:24:03,128
of what I learned to make Vine videos

645
00:24:03,128 --> 00:24:05,139
and Instagram 15-second videos,

646
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:06,480
which have deployed and created

647
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,401
enourmous amounts of money for me.

648
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:10,331
You're learning a skill,

649
00:24:10,331 --> 00:24:12,521
do you think the world's
gonna just stand still

650
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:14,849
and never evolve?

651
00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:16,454
And so, we're making a lot of mistakes

652
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,136
in this collective room,
because we're stuck

653
00:24:19,136 --> 00:24:20,582
in a math game.

654
00:24:20,582 --> 00:24:23,727
The same stuff that put 
Zynga and LivingSocial

655
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:25,373
in a really bad place.

656
00:24:25,373 --> 00:24:26,441
So it's fine if you're playing

657
00:24:26,441 --> 00:24:28,525
at a micro, micro level and that's cute,

658
00:24:28,525 --> 00:24:30,720
and that's cool, and do you,

659
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,284
and everybody's got different wants

660
00:24:32,284 --> 00:24:35,018
and needs in life, but please,

661
00:24:35,018 --> 00:24:36,826
please understand that the market

662
00:24:36,826 --> 00:24:38,391
doesn't care about you.

663
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:42,007
When I saw Uber, before I
invested in it, I called my dad.

664
00:24:42,007 --> 00:24:43,145
When my dad came to America,

665
00:24:43,145 --> 00:24:45,725
he went to New Jersey,
but some of you may know,

666
00:24:45,725 --> 00:24:47,554
if you lived in the L.A. area,

667
00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:49,150
a lot of Russians moved to L.A.,

668
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,552
and they went into the cab business,

669
00:24:50,552 --> 00:24:51,588
they were, you know?

670
00:24:51,588 --> 00:24:53,234
These are men, these are my dad's friends,

671
00:24:53,234 --> 00:24:54,697
by the way, these are men that came

672
00:24:54,697 --> 00:24:55,643
to America with no money,

673
00:24:55,643 --> 00:24:56,902
and started being cab drivers,

674
00:24:56,902 --> 00:24:58,243
making two bucks an hour.

675
00:24:58,243 --> 00:24:58,853
Right?

676
00:24:58,853 --> 00:24:59,799
They built up, you know,

677
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,485
immigrants are really good at one thing?

678
00:25:01,485 --> 00:25:03,842
Not spending money on dumb crap, right?

679
00:25:03,842 --> 00:25:05,418
So, they save their money forever,

680
00:25:05,418 --> 00:25:08,660
and they buy medallion
and a car and they build.

681
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,154
So, I see this thing and I'm like,

682
00:25:10,154 --> 00:25:11,832
man this Uber thing's gonna,

683
00:25:11,832 --> 00:25:13,754
and not at first, I
didn't see it at first,

684
00:25:13,754 --> 00:25:14,933
that's a little bit later,

685
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:17,626
but then when it, it happened fast.

686
00:25:17,626 --> 00:25:19,374
Like, San Francisco first market,

687
00:25:19,374 --> 00:25:21,255
the numbers were like ten x

688
00:25:21,255 --> 00:25:22,737
what they projected like week,

689
00:25:22,737 --> 00:25:24,690
I mean, it happened fast, right?

690
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,063
We all know what Uber is.

691
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:28,989
So, I call my dad, I said,

692
00:25:28,989 --> 00:25:30,728
dad, I gotta call your friend Madic

693
00:25:30,728 --> 00:25:33,064
and Nikolai and Vladimir and all

694
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,994
those cliche Russian names (laughter)

695
00:25:34,994 --> 00:25:37,656
and I said, I gotta call your homies.

696
00:25:37,656 --> 00:25:39,749
And so, I did, he gave me the number,

697
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:41,272
and I called them.

698
00:25:41,272 --> 00:25:42,349
Now these are men that I love,

699
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:43,751
these are like pseudo-uncles,

700
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:45,225
these are my dad's best friends,

701
00:25:45,225 --> 00:25:46,444
these are men that came to this country,

702
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:49,349
worked their face off for 30 years,

703
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,767
they're finally in their late 50s and 60s,

704
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:55,181
and they finally have
fleet of cars, right?

705
00:25:55,181 --> 00:25:57,664
They're getting residual,
they're finally got their boats

706
00:25:57,664 --> 00:26:00,062
and, I have my dad's DNA,
my dad's a workaholic,

707
00:26:00,062 --> 00:26:01,159
he's gonna work, 
but a lot of these guys

708
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,605
are startin' to chill a little bit

709
00:26:02,605 --> 00:26:04,736
after 30 years, 
they can enjoy themselves.

710
00:26:04,736 --> 00:26:06,635
And I call them, and I go, look,

711
00:26:06,635 --> 00:26:08,505
this thing, Uber, and
I explained it to them,

712
00:26:08,505 --> 00:26:09,846
like, you take your phone and,

713
00:26:09,846 --> 00:26:11,115
I mean, you know?

714
00:26:11,115 --> 00:26:11,683
Right?

715
00:26:11,683 --> 00:26:13,420
I'm like, the phone, they'll come.

716
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:17,604
And they're like, "Boychik,
boychik, boychik. (laughter)

717
00:26:17,604 --> 00:26:19,392
"That's very cute, right?

718
00:26:19,392 --> 00:26:20,590
"But, da-da-da-da-da-da-da,"

719
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,072
I said, okay, cool.

720
00:26:22,072 --> 00:26:25,190
36 months later these mens' businesses

721
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,735
are literally, 36 months,
after 30 years of working

722
00:26:28,735 --> 00:26:31,986
every day, 36 months later,

723
00:26:31,986 --> 00:26:33,489
these guys' businesses are worth

724
00:26:33,489 --> 00:26:36,232
between a nickel to a dime

725
00:26:36,232 --> 00:26:40,946
on the dollar that it was 36 months ago.

726
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:43,404
Guys, innovation doesn't give a crap

727
00:26:43,404 --> 00:26:47,813
about you or me.
You're just in the way.

728
00:26:47,813 --> 00:26:51,531
And what most of you do
is you wanna hold ground

729
00:26:51,531 --> 00:26:54,376
as it comes directly in your face.

730
00:26:54,376 --> 00:26:56,629
My friends, can we all agree

731
00:26:56,629 --> 00:26:59,067
this is an important device in life?

732
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:01,382
Can we agree, can you (mumbles)
agree with me on this?

733
00:27:01,382 --> 00:27:03,292
- [Voiceover] Yes!

734
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:08,168
- Do you know that 53% of
every person's attention,

735
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,789
the collective, on this device

736
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:14,090
is spent on social networks?

737
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,523
53%, you have games, movies,

738
00:27:17,523 --> 00:27:19,067
calendars, runner aps,

739
00:27:19,067 --> 00:27:23,984
53% of our collective,
and not teenage girls

740
00:27:23,984 --> 00:27:28,963
in Manhattan, 53% of the collective

741
00:27:28,963 --> 00:27:31,592
is spending time on social media.

742
00:27:31,592 --> 00:27:34,823
Oh, I'm sorry, social media, A.K.A.

743
00:27:34,823 --> 00:27:38,726
the slang term for the current state

744
00:27:38,726 --> 00:27:41,379
of the Internet.

745
00:27:41,379 --> 00:27:44,844
So, I can stand here and tell you

746
00:27:44,844 --> 00:27:49,273
of 50, not four, not one, 50 businesses

747
00:27:49,273 --> 00:27:52,687
that I'm associated with
that are converting sales,

748
00:27:52,687 --> 00:27:55,572
leads, transactions, money,

749
00:27:55,572 --> 00:28:00,082
better on Facebook than on Google,

750
00:28:00,082 --> 00:28:04,471
or banner retargeting right now.

751
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:08,055
I can, flat out, best in class e-com guys,

752
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:11,217
how many people here are
familiar with the app Wish?

753
00:28:11,217 --> 00:28:12,111
Raise your hand.

754
00:28:12,111 --> 00:28:13,545
Raise it, I wanna see how many of you,

755
00:28:13,545 --> 00:28:14,836
raise it high, I wanna see.

756
00:28:14,836 --> 00:28:19,204
So, good, Wish, the fastest
growing e-commerce product

757
00:28:19,204 --> 00:28:23,263
in the world. Huge in every 
country in the world.

758
00:28:23,263 --> 00:28:27,291
It is founded by 13 members,

759
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:30,257
but three core founders, that were all

760
00:28:30,257 --> 00:28:33,020
on Google's AdWords team.

761
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,788
Every dollar they have spent

762
00:28:34,788 --> 00:28:36,393
to build the biggest shopping app

763
00:28:36,393 --> 00:28:40,332
in the world has been on Facebook.

764
00:28:41,626 --> 00:28:45,324
My personal trainer, Mike, (chuckles)

765
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,138
has made more transactions

766
00:28:47,138 --> 00:28:51,161
to his $400 a month online course

767
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:56,130
through Snapchat content
in the last 90 days

768
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,771
than he has on Facebook ads, Twitter,

769
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:02,774
Google AdWords, affiliate
and Instagram combined,

770
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:05,496
in 18 months.

771
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:10,047
This is not headline reading,
this is not hyperbole,

772
00:29:10,047 --> 00:29:12,729
this is not curiosity,
this is not the future,

773
00:29:12,729 --> 00:29:14,294
this is happening right now.

774
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,326
Here's the fundamental difference,

775
00:29:16,326 --> 00:29:20,430
Mike's a better practitioner
in Snapchat content

776
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,807
than he was in the other stuff.

777
00:29:22,807 --> 00:29:25,143
There is a land grab going on right now

778
00:29:25,143 --> 00:29:26,931
on Snapchat, because people don't know

779
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,004
who to follow, there is no functionality,

780
00:29:29,004 --> 00:29:31,230
so, he gets that awareness.

781
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,591
And we've watched 
this very carefully,

782
00:29:32,591 --> 00:29:34,379
so much of it is not 
even coming from me,

783
00:29:34,379 --> 00:29:36,188
I'm on purpose not giving
him as much shout-outs

784
00:29:36,188 --> 00:29:40,576
as possible, 'cause I want
to see it naturally happen.

785
00:29:40,576 --> 00:29:42,161
I just want everybody in this room

786
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:46,224
to understand, I'm not predicting here,

787
00:29:46,224 --> 00:29:48,378
I'm telling you the past,

788
00:29:48,378 --> 00:29:50,633
the past will tell you the future.

789
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:53,254
It's always the same
game, it's happening right

790
00:29:53,254 --> 00:29:56,241
in front of your eyes,
you're going out every night,

791
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:59,329
when you go out every night, every night,

792
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:01,137
and you go to the restaurant or a bar,

793
00:30:01,137 --> 00:30:02,539
when people are 
opening up their phone

794
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:04,754
and going to Instagram or Snapchat,

795
00:30:04,754 --> 00:30:07,741
they're not searching on Google.

796
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:08,980
They're not going on a random site

797
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,210
that has an affiliate link,
they're not getting pumped

798
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,989
to go on their phone
and click a banner ad.

799
00:30:15,989 --> 00:30:17,188
How many people in this room

800
00:30:17,188 --> 00:30:19,829
have never, on purpose,
'cause those X's are small,

801
00:30:19,829 --> 00:30:21,597
how many people in 
this room have never,

802
00:30:21,597 --> 00:30:23,344
on purpose, clicked a banner ad

803
00:30:23,344 --> 00:30:24,401
on their mobile device?

804
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:26,006
Raise your hand, everybody.

805
00:30:26,006 --> 00:30:29,350
(laughter)

806
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,991
I mean, you're living one way,

807
00:30:31,991 --> 00:30:34,714
you're living one way 
as a human being,

808
00:30:34,714 --> 00:30:38,290
and you're marketing a separate way,

809
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:41,337
and in that arbitrage comes

810
00:30:41,337 --> 00:30:43,511
going out (loud claps) of business.

811
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:44,895
It may not happen today.

812
00:30:44,895 --> 00:30:50,013
It may not happen tomorrow 
but it is full-on happening.

813
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:52,268
And it's happening because of a couple

814
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:54,851
of different things,
early consumer behavior,

815
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:56,842
I can't believe what
I'm about to tell you,

816
00:30:56,842 --> 00:31:00,540
I now no longer travel with a laptop.

817
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,551
For the last three weeks,
no, a little bit more,

818
00:31:02,551 --> 00:31:05,700
last, for this actually, this year,

819
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,788
every trip I've taken, I've
only taken with my phone.

820
00:31:08,788 --> 00:31:11,694
I now do everything I do on my phone.

821
00:31:11,694 --> 00:31:14,030
It, that's insane, like, to me.

822
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,809
Even to me, that only preaches this,

823
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:17,699
like, I can't believe that.

824
00:31:17,699 --> 00:31:22,657
Like, when you think about
your conversion rates

825
00:31:22,657 --> 00:31:26,081
and your funnel, and your optimization

826
00:31:26,081 --> 00:31:29,779
on your dot-com desktop versus mobile,

827
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:31,993
go look at those numbers
when you get home,

828
00:31:31,993 --> 00:31:34,696
see how that math works out for you.

829
00:31:34,696 --> 00:31:37,946
My friends, I implore you,

830
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:41,014
whether you agree with
this hyperbole or not,

831
00:31:41,014 --> 00:31:44,103
take five hours, it's not a lot of time,

832
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:46,541
and please understand that shifts

833
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:50,746
are happening very quickly,
and it is super cliche

834
00:31:50,746 --> 00:31:53,286
why people lose because they don't adapt

835
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,277
to current market behaviors,

836
00:31:55,277 --> 00:31:57,126
not because they're not smart,

837
00:31:57,126 --> 00:31:59,727
but because you started
making a couple of bucks

838
00:31:59,727 --> 00:32:02,449
and you don't want it to go away.

839
00:32:02,449 --> 00:32:04,928
Guys, the quickest way
to go out of business

840
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:09,378
is to be romantic about
how you make your money.

841
00:32:09,378 --> 00:32:12,039
It's a big deal, you know?

842
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,911
You could have rah-rah. 
You can have balloons

843
00:32:13,911 --> 00:32:14,887
or whatever the hell you guys were

844
00:32:14,887 --> 00:32:17,476
throwing up here, 
rock music, give awards,

845
00:32:17,476 --> 00:32:20,334
paper checks, 
that's all fine and dandy.

846
00:32:20,334 --> 00:32:21,919
You know what's 
way more interesting?

847
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,686
The market.

848
00:32:23,686 --> 00:32:25,169
The market is doing its thing,

849
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:28,461
and it's happening fast, and
you can get very confused,

850
00:32:28,461 --> 00:32:30,594
very quickly, because normally

851
00:32:30,594 --> 00:32:33,493
when you're playing
arbitrage, 'cause that's what

852
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,139
so many of you are playing,

853
00:32:35,139 --> 00:32:37,355
normally, when you play arbitrage,

854
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,529
here's what it looks like.

855
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:40,545
And what I mean by arbitrage,

856
00:32:40,545 --> 00:32:42,142
just to make sure I'm giving clarity is,

857
00:32:42,142 --> 00:32:43,828
you're playing conversation base, right?

858
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:45,332
You're buying ads for this,
you're converting that,

859
00:32:45,332 --> 00:32:47,424
it's just math, you're buying these leads

860
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:48,542
for that, whatever it is,

861
00:32:48,542 --> 00:32:49,578
whether it's affiliate, or Google

862
00:32:49,578 --> 00:32:51,938
or Facebook, it doesn't
matter, it's just quant, right?

863
00:32:51,938 --> 00:32:54,579
It's just math, right?

864
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:56,083
Here's how those businesses look,

865
00:32:56,083 --> 00:33:00,764
for all time, not today,
du-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu, pfiu.

866
00:33:02,424 --> 00:33:05,820
And so, I come here with empathy

867
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,177
and try to get people to understand

868
00:33:08,177 --> 00:33:09,904
that you have to pay attention

869
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,771
to where consumer's attention's going.

870
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:15,006
Where technology is going is more scary

871
00:33:15,006 --> 00:33:16,266
for a lot of people in here,

872
00:33:16,266 --> 00:33:18,806
that are not in the branding
and marketing business,

873
00:33:18,806 --> 00:33:21,183
and are in the conversion business.

874
00:33:21,183 --> 00:33:23,600
And again, conversion business, you know?

875
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,104
You're buying ads that lead to whatever

876
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:27,452
you're selling, supplements, 
masterminds, e-books,

877
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:29,423
whatever the hell you're doing,

878
00:33:29,423 --> 00:33:30,784
it's all that.

879
00:33:30,784 --> 00:33:32,511
And let me tell you why,

880
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,433
because starting with this,

881
00:33:34,433 --> 00:33:36,058
du-du-du-du-du, remember that?

882
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:37,155
TiVo?

883
00:33:37,155 --> 00:33:40,040
When that happened, everything changed.

884
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,763
Watch this, this is for my
own personal gratification.

885
00:33:42,763 --> 00:33:47,061
How many people in this
room, (clears throat)

886
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:50,231
when now watching television,

887
00:33:50,231 --> 00:33:51,816
watch it on their time?

888
00:33:51,816 --> 00:33:54,021
Meaning, outside of live sports,

889
00:33:54,021 --> 00:33:57,576
TiVo, DVR, Netflix, when a show airs,

890
00:33:57,576 --> 00:33:59,385
you don't watch it, you
watch it when you have time.

891
00:33:59,385 --> 00:34:03,570
Raise your hand, everybody. (laughter)

892
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,191
How many of you, when given the option,

893
00:34:06,191 --> 00:34:10,031
fast forward every single commercial?

894
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:12,449
Everybody.

895
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:16,695
My clients, at VaynerMedia,
Unilever, Pepsi,

896
00:34:16,695 --> 00:34:19,275
Turner, Toyota, all the bigget brands

897
00:34:19,275 --> 00:34:23,339
in the world spend 80 billion dollars

898
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:26,549
making commercials and
then distributing them

899
00:34:26,549 --> 00:34:29,333
and not a soul in 
America's watching them.

900
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,547
And even if they get lucky enough,

901
00:34:31,547 --> 00:34:34,038
that you see it, because you're in bed

902
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:37,938
and your remote control
falls off your bed,

903
00:34:37,938 --> 00:34:41,940
(laughter)

904
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,313
even if that happens, every person

905
00:34:45,313 --> 00:34:48,626
in this room grabs their phone

906
00:34:48,626 --> 00:34:52,791
and checks their work,
checks their Instagram,

907
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,882
sends a tweet, and then they sell you

908
00:34:54,882 --> 00:34:57,951
on this bullcrap that, "But sports is

909
00:34:57,951 --> 00:35:00,125
"still the last holy grail, right?"

910
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:03,392
Meanwhile, the highest engagement

911
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:08,085
on Twitter spikes always
are during commercial time

912
00:35:08,085 --> 00:35:10,198
of big sporting events, 'cause everybody

913
00:35:10,198 --> 00:35:14,009
wants to tweet about Steph
Curry's half-court shot.

914
00:35:14,009 --> 00:35:15,146
Right?

915
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:18,682
So, while that mountain goes up this hill

916
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:21,120
or that cute girl tries
to sell you a soda,

917
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,757
you're paying attention to this, not that.

918
00:35:24,757 --> 00:35:26,788
That same thesis of technology

919
00:35:26,788 --> 00:35:28,393
that created fast forwarding,

920
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:29,531
because the only thing you guys

921
00:35:29,531 --> 00:35:33,951
really care about is health comma money

922
00:35:33,951 --> 00:35:37,893
comma your family comma, not in order,

923
00:35:37,893 --> 00:35:39,477
or depends on how you roll, (laughter)

924
00:35:39,477 --> 00:35:41,854
and finally, the one that most people

925
00:35:41,854 --> 00:35:43,947
don't understand, the fourth one,

926
00:35:43,947 --> 00:35:46,629
and it's the big one, and
it's the fastest growing one

927
00:35:46,629 --> 00:35:49,981
in value, time.

928
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,704
You care about time,
and you don't realize it

929
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,720
but you're doing a lot of things

930
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,036
where you, if you broke down your life

931
00:35:56,036 --> 00:35:58,169
the way I break down your life,

932
00:35:58,169 --> 00:36:00,689
and you realize how much money

933
00:36:00,689 --> 00:36:02,538
you're giving up for time,

934
00:36:02,538 --> 00:36:04,041
you would go crazy.

935
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:06,328
You would not believe some
of the stuff you're doing,

936
00:36:06,328 --> 00:36:07,587
'cause you value time so much,

937
00:36:07,587 --> 00:36:10,181
that you're overpaying, I mean, it's.

938
00:36:10,181 --> 00:36:11,838
I started doing something
that really bothered me,

939
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:15,648
I'm an immigrant that 
came from nothing,

940
00:36:15,648 --> 00:36:16,705
like four or five years ago,

941
00:36:16,705 --> 00:36:18,971
I started leaving all the change

942
00:36:18,971 --> 00:36:21,958
that I got back, on the counter.

943
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:23,055
And I was like, oh, god,

944
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,355
if my dad saw this, he would rip

945
00:36:24,355 --> 00:36:26,062
my face off, right? (laughter)

946
00:36:26,062 --> 00:36:26,602
You know?

947
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:30,096
All of it, 94 cents, one cent.

948
00:36:30,096 --> 00:36:31,661
And somewhere around two years ago,

949
00:36:31,661 --> 00:36:33,928
was like, oh my god, time,

950
00:36:33,928 --> 00:36:36,041
like I, something that some of you,

951
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:37,535
how many people 
have watched DailyVee?

952
00:36:37,535 --> 00:36:38,652
Raise your hand.

953
00:36:38,652 --> 00:36:39,953
Appreciate it. (crowd cheers)

954
00:36:39,953 --> 00:36:41,233
You guys saw a couple of episodes ago,

955
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:44,423
I don't tie my shoes, ever. (laughter)

956
00:36:44,423 --> 00:36:47,369
Time, I'll tie time if
like I finally settle down

957
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:49,278
and I'm, but I would never be walking

958
00:36:49,278 --> 00:36:50,985
and stop and tie them.

959
00:36:50,985 --> 00:36:55,028
Time, and time's why we
fast forward commercials,

960
00:36:55,028 --> 00:36:57,243
and time is why technology is gonna

961
00:36:57,243 --> 00:37:00,877
be built like ad blockers,

962
00:37:00,877 --> 00:37:02,696
like what's going on now

963
00:37:02,696 --> 00:37:05,309
where everything on a mobile device

964
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:07,808
that is either an affiliate or an ad

965
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,921
or a click to something you don't want,

966
00:37:09,921 --> 00:37:12,095
Outbrain, Taboola, that world,

967
00:37:12,095 --> 00:37:14,431
will not be in front of you,

968
00:37:14,431 --> 00:37:16,666
'cause Apple doesn't need that money.

969
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:17,784
Got it?

970
00:37:17,784 --> 00:37:21,014
Please understand, the reason

971
00:37:21,014 --> 00:37:23,249
so many of you like 
me because I'll answer

972
00:37:23,249 --> 00:37:25,159
your questions any time, 
I'm not trying

973
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,507
to have like gated wall 
or a mastermind,

974
00:37:27,507 --> 00:37:29,681
yes, every three years I sell a book

975
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:33,345
for $19, kill me, but for the most part,

976
00:37:33,345 --> 00:37:34,641
(laughter) for the most part,

977
00:37:34,641 --> 00:37:37,086
it all is me giving away?

978
00:37:37,086 --> 00:37:38,183
Yeah, I'm a good guy,

979
00:37:38,183 --> 00:37:39,687
mom and dad had 
sex at the right moment

980
00:37:39,687 --> 00:37:43,039
and gave me nice guy DNA. 
(laughter)

981
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:44,888
But there's another reason I do it,

982
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,407
it's 'cause I'm building a brand,

983
00:37:47,407 --> 00:37:50,191
I'm building a brand.
(audience cheers)

984
00:37:50,191 --> 00:37:53,494
I'm not tryin' to transact 
you at every corner,

985
00:37:53,494 --> 00:37:54,388
like every other.

986
00:37:54,388 --> 00:37:55,810
Do you know how 
many people right now

987
00:37:55,810 --> 00:38:00,503
are running ads for 
Snapchat crash courses

988
00:38:00,503 --> 00:38:03,510
for 300 bucks, who are completely

989
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,319
just ripping off my free content

990
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:07,432
and packaging it up and then are fans

991
00:38:07,432 --> 00:38:08,732
of me and saying, "This is great,"

992
00:38:08,732 --> 00:38:11,518
and then doing this bullcrap?

993
00:38:11,518 --> 00:38:14,748
So, my friends, my friends,

994
00:38:14,748 --> 00:38:16,983
it's fine, and I will never stand here

995
00:38:16,983 --> 00:38:19,381
and begrudge how anybody
makes their money,

996
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:23,180
you do you, but I stand
here in front of you today,

997
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:27,142
ICON, caring about my brand forever.

998
00:38:27,142 --> 00:38:30,007
Caring about my legacy forever,

999
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:32,587
caring more about 
how I made my money,

1000
00:38:32,587 --> 00:38:37,298
than how much I made. 
(audience cheers)

1001
00:38:40,827 --> 00:38:42,851
And, what the dirty little secret is

1002
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:45,601
of that little Mother Teresa rant,

1003
00:38:45,601 --> 00:38:48,364
is not only do I get to
be a better human being

1004
00:38:48,364 --> 00:38:51,119
than most people, I actually

1005
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,124
get to survive every shift

1006
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:58,853
in technology, because I have a brand,

1007
00:38:58,853 --> 00:39:01,088
because I can go do the next platform,

1008
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,673
because the day I decided to get serious

1009
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:06,228
about Snapchat, I already had 9,000 views

1010
00:39:06,228 --> 00:39:09,256
on my snaps, 'cause I brought value,

1011
00:39:09,256 --> 00:39:13,279
not transactions, and this, my friends,

1012
00:39:13,279 --> 00:39:15,615
is a room full of transactors,

1013
00:39:15,615 --> 00:39:17,952
and that's the truth and you know it.

1014
00:39:17,952 --> 00:39:21,243
And it is what it is, and I'm telling you

1015
00:39:21,243 --> 00:39:24,322
it's not because I'm mad or
I wanna stand on top of you

1016
00:39:24,322 --> 00:39:26,435
and say, that's it. 
I'm saying it because

1017
00:39:26,435 --> 00:39:28,559
I want you to win, I'm saying it because

1018
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:30,449
what's great about
capitalism and marketing

1019
00:39:30,449 --> 00:39:33,314
and business is you 
can change tomorrow

1020
00:39:33,314 --> 00:39:36,625
and it can change, but too many

1021
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:39,978
are crippled by the money they make.

1022
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:42,671
And what really pisses me off
is I have some real friends

1023
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:45,536
that are transactors, making
hundreds of thousands,

1024
00:39:45,536 --> 00:39:47,344
millions of dollars, and I tell them,

1025
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:50,595
shift it, you'll be safer, shift it!

1026
00:39:50,595 --> 00:39:52,525
And, they're like, "I
can't afford," I mean,

1027
00:39:52,525 --> 00:39:53,825
these are, you know?

1028
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:56,265
Wine background helps, I get them,

1029
00:39:56,265 --> 00:39:58,175
I know which wines have a
little more alcohol than others

1030
00:39:58,175 --> 00:39:59,881
and I'm like, (laughter)
so when I get them

1031
00:39:59,881 --> 00:40:03,529
in a real place, after
four glasses of wine, when.

1032
00:40:03,529 --> 00:40:04,272
You know what pisses me off?

1033
00:40:04,272 --> 00:40:06,060
I go to conferences like this with them,

1034
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,787
they sit with me on stage,

1035
00:40:07,787 --> 00:40:09,839
they spew their bullcrap,
because they wanna make money

1036
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,638
on you, and then when 
I get them drunk,

1037
00:40:11,638 --> 00:40:13,786
they're like, "Yeah,
you're telling the truth."

1038
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:14,883
They can't be my friends,

1039
00:40:14,883 --> 00:40:17,251
I can only call them my acquaintances

1040
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:18,551
or my contemporaries.

1041
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:21,782
They can't be my friends
when they do that, right?

1042
00:40:21,782 --> 00:40:23,143
And, when I talk to them,

1043
00:40:23,143 --> 00:40:24,484
they're like, "Gary, I can't afford it,"

1044
00:40:24,484 --> 00:40:26,109
and they get real with me, these are guys

1045
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:28,226
I've known for seven, 10
years, they get real with me,

1046
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:30,676
they're like, "Gary, it's hard to go back,

1047
00:40:30,676 --> 00:40:33,064
"I came from nothing, now I got this."

1048
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:36,895
And I look at it and I'm,
they have so much, you know?

1049
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:38,866
One of 'em right now literally,

1050
00:40:38,866 --> 00:40:42,280
he vacations like 40% of his life,

1051
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,953
he could vacation 20% of his life

1052
00:40:44,953 --> 00:40:47,025
and deploy the other 20% against building

1053
00:40:47,025 --> 00:40:49,220
an actual thing that has value

1054
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,028
to the end consumer long-term.

1055
00:40:51,028 --> 00:40:54,258
My friends, we're at a very awkward place

1056
00:40:54,258 --> 00:40:57,733
in Internet culture, where
everybody's absolutely,

1057
00:40:57,733 --> 00:40:58,891
and it's just business culture,

1058
00:40:58,891 --> 00:41:00,374
it's not even Internet culture,

1059
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,284
where everybody's absolutely thinking

1060
00:41:02,284 --> 00:41:04,600
way too short-term.

1061
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,277
The scarier part is, this mobile shift

1062
00:41:08,277 --> 00:41:10,248
is happening very quickly,

1063
00:41:10,248 --> 00:41:13,296
and you're gonna wake
up in 36 to 48 months

1064
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:16,425
and all that desktop
traffic is gonna be gone,

1065
00:41:16,425 --> 00:41:18,396
and you're gonna have to adjust,

1066
00:41:18,396 --> 00:41:20,673
and people's attentions are
gonna be in different places,

1067
00:41:20,673 --> 00:41:22,238
and you're gonna have to adjust.

1068
00:41:22,238 --> 00:41:23,721
And things are gonna come, listen,

1069
00:41:23,721 --> 00:41:25,662
I don't, listen, I like D.R. better

1070
00:41:25,662 --> 00:41:27,441
than branding, too.

1071
00:41:27,441 --> 00:41:30,103
I like math. I like knowing the math.

1072
00:41:30,103 --> 00:41:31,313
I love running Facebook ads

1073
00:41:31,313 --> 00:41:32,999
and running 80 bucks and getting

1074
00:41:32,999 --> 00:41:34,525
a customer for Wine Library for a buck 20,

1075
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:35,636
and knowing that they're gonna shop.

1076
00:41:35,636 --> 00:41:37,354
Like, I love it!

1077
00:41:37,354 --> 00:41:39,873
It's just only part of it,

1078
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:43,225
it can't be your business, right?

1079
00:41:43,225 --> 00:41:47,411
I don't like Snapchat,
Snapchat's hard! (laughter)

1080
00:41:47,411 --> 00:41:51,303
Snapchat is hard.
You have to create content.

1081
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:54,676
It's television, it's
Youtube, it's way harder

1082
00:41:54,676 --> 00:41:56,911
than writing copy, or being good at

1083
00:41:56,911 --> 00:42:00,608
planning the creative and the planning

1084
00:42:00,608 --> 00:42:04,326
the segmentation and cohorts and math.

1085
00:42:04,326 --> 00:42:07,049
Math is commoditized,

1086
00:42:07,049 --> 00:42:08,674
brand is not.

1087
00:42:08,674 --> 00:42:11,417
And that's just true, it's true,

1088
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:12,587
there was no math that got me

1089
00:42:12,587 --> 00:42:14,822
to buy these Nikes.

1090
00:42:14,822 --> 00:42:17,321
Nike's brand got me to buy these Nikes.

1091
00:42:17,321 --> 00:42:18,703
Got it?

1092
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:21,059
And, there's so many smart ways to do it.

1093
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:22,380
How many people here have done

1094
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,875
campaigns using Instagram
influencers for their business?

1095
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:29,085
Raise your hand.

1096
00:42:29,085 --> 00:42:32,112
Jesus. (laughter)

1097
00:42:32,112 --> 00:42:34,245
I would tell you besides Facebook,

1098
00:42:34,245 --> 00:42:38,024
the best math arbitrage in the world

1099
00:42:38,024 --> 00:42:42,047
is Instagram influencers product
placement and conversion.

1100
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,993
Yet, because, you know why I asked it?

1101
00:42:44,993 --> 00:42:47,960
Because I know that it's
not pure math, right?

1102
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,032
It's not pure, there's an ad platform,

1103
00:42:50,032 --> 00:42:51,210
and I can just do it,

1104
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,161
there's no algorithm, there's no exchange,

1105
00:42:53,161 --> 00:42:54,888
there's no affiliate, there's no that,

1106
00:42:54,888 --> 00:42:56,656
because there's some other thing

1107
00:42:56,656 --> 00:42:58,708
besides that, where you gotta reach out

1108
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:00,617
to a person, negotiate, something.

1109
00:43:00,617 --> 00:43:01,674
And you gotta think 
about the creative,

1110
00:43:01,674 --> 00:43:03,503
and how the brand 
looks on the picture,

1111
00:43:03,503 --> 00:43:05,616
because there's something,

1112
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:08,115
99.6% of this room is not involved.

1113
00:43:08,115 --> 00:43:10,289
Even though mathematically,

1114
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:12,808
it's so easy to track,
because they run it,

1115
00:43:12,808 --> 00:43:15,177
they do a call to action with a code,

1116
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:16,489
or they put a link in their profile

1117
00:43:16,489 --> 00:43:20,268
and you can quantifiably, not qual, quant.

1118
00:43:20,268 --> 00:43:22,868
Not qual, quant!

1119
00:43:22,868 --> 00:43:25,327
Yet, because there's 
just 10% of something

1120
00:43:25,327 --> 00:43:28,293
that isn't horsecrap, man,
I'm really fighting here.

1121
00:43:28,293 --> 00:43:32,153
(heartily laughter)

1122
00:43:32,153 --> 00:43:34,348
Because there's only 10% of something

1123
00:43:34,348 --> 00:43:37,944
that's not algorithmically,
sit in your shorts,

1124
00:43:37,944 --> 00:43:41,195
not talk to another human, 
run all math,

1125
00:43:41,195 --> 00:43:43,664
this entire room has 
stayed away from it.

1126
00:43:43,664 --> 00:43:47,261
While in March 2013 
it's the second best

1127
00:43:47,261 --> 00:43:50,247
quant conversion 
on the Internet.

1128
00:43:50,247 --> 00:43:52,604
SHREDZ and Protein World have gone

1129
00:43:52,604 --> 00:43:55,794
from zero to 
50 and 80 million dollars

1130
00:43:55,794 --> 00:43:57,677
in sales in 24 months,

1131
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:02,925
product placing their crap 
on pretty girls on Instagram.

1132
00:44:02,925 --> 00:44:05,099
Where are you guys?

1133
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:06,492
I'll tell you where you are,

1134
00:44:06,492 --> 00:44:08,321
you're in the cliche place,

1135
00:44:08,321 --> 00:44:09,560
that makes the next five years

1136
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,339
not look so good, 
that's where you are!

1137
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:16,732
So, I come here 
to be Debbie Downer

1138
00:44:16,732 --> 00:44:19,841
for a few minutes, (laughter)

1139
00:44:19,841 --> 00:44:23,782
only out of love, only
out of hope (loud claps)

1140
00:44:23,782 --> 00:44:25,529
that three to nine people in here

1141
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,866
listen to me hardcore and do (laughter).

1142
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:29,776
And I'm, by the way, I mean it!

1143
00:44:29,776 --> 00:44:32,826
I've done this a long time.

1144
00:44:32,826 --> 00:44:34,594
I see a lot of faces I've
known for a long time,

1145
00:44:34,594 --> 00:44:36,443
I've done this a long time.

1146
00:44:36,443 --> 00:44:37,865
I know that I can come in here

1147
00:44:37,865 --> 00:44:40,669
and do my thing, 
and everybody feels it

1148
00:44:40,669 --> 00:44:42,562
and bunch of, I mean,
I'm watching your faces,

1149
00:44:42,562 --> 00:44:43,528
that's why I'm glad the lights are on,

1150
00:44:43,528 --> 00:44:44,849
I'm seeing what's going on,

1151
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:45,845
people are commenting about people

1152
00:44:45,845 --> 00:44:47,246
that are doing the Snapchat thing,

1153
00:44:47,246 --> 00:44:49,705
and who's doing it, so
it's like, I'm watching.

1154
00:44:49,705 --> 00:44:52,915
And people get inspired, and
people get somewhat curious,

1155
00:44:52,915 --> 00:44:54,622
they may go home and go
down the rabbit hole,

1156
00:44:54,622 --> 00:44:56,085
they're thinking about
other people in here

1157
00:44:56,085 --> 00:44:57,751
that they know that
were kinda selling this,

1158
00:44:57,751 --> 00:44:58,412
and they're like, "Oh, wait a minute,

1159
00:44:58,412 --> 00:45:00,017
"maybe I should go talk
to Rick one more time."

1160
00:45:00,017 --> 00:45:01,622
I know what's going on.

1161
00:45:01,622 --> 00:45:04,080
And then, this is what happens.

1162
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:09,049
Next Thursday happens, 
and next Thursday

1163
00:45:09,049 --> 00:45:11,530
you're quant game 
didn't look so good,

1164
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:12,831
you made a little bit
less than you thought you

1165
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,508
were supposed to, one of
your goddamn affiliates

1166
00:45:15,508 --> 00:45:18,759
dropped out, and your
moneys don't look so good

1167
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:20,526
and you go on the defense, and go back

1168
00:45:20,526 --> 00:45:23,940
to tried and true, instead of the offense.

1169
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,922
And you look that wave of innovation

1170
00:45:25,922 --> 00:45:28,218
in the face, and it's over there,

1171
00:45:28,218 --> 00:45:29,925
and you look at it with complete

1172
00:45:29,925 --> 00:45:32,258
and utter disrespect as it comes

1173
00:45:32,258 --> 00:45:35,695
marching directly for your mouth.

1174
00:45:35,695 --> 00:45:39,024
And so, I'm looking for
three to nine people,

1175
00:45:39,024 --> 00:45:40,385
the three to nine people that I get

1176
00:45:40,385 --> 00:45:43,769
every four or five years, that say,

1177
00:45:43,769 --> 00:45:46,959
"Gary, I saw you at
South by Southwest 2011,

1178
00:45:46,959 --> 00:45:49,458
"I was one of those copyrighter jerkoffs,

1179
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:51,449
"conversion, this, that, the other thing.

1180
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:53,359
"I was making 800,000 a year selling pills

1181
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:54,680
"from China that I white-labelled,

1182
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,033
"I had no idea what is in it. (laughter)

1183
00:45:56,033 --> 00:45:59,234
"I bet you I killed thousands of people.

1184
00:45:59,234 --> 00:46:01,489
"And then you spoke to me, 
you spoke to me

1185
00:46:01,489 --> 00:46:04,253
"that day, and you changed my life.

1186
00:46:04,253 --> 00:46:07,199
"I was some $480 e-books 
that all it was

1187
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:09,127
"was crap I got for free
around the Internet,

1188
00:46:09,127 --> 00:46:11,860
"and you spoke to me, 
and you changed me."

1189
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,363
That's who I'm looking for today.

1190
00:46:13,363 --> 00:46:15,793
Three to nine of you, (audience cheers),

1191
00:46:15,793 --> 00:46:17,418
that are willing to be patient

1192
00:46:17,418 --> 00:46:19,816
to be proud about when your kids

1193
00:46:19,816 --> 00:46:21,319
look your name up on the Internet

1194
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:24,387
in 30 years, and realize
you did it the right way,

1195
00:46:24,387 --> 00:46:26,256
instead of the wrong way.

1196
00:46:26,256 --> 00:46:30,509
(audience applauds and cheers)

1197
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,038
And you know what 
the best part is for me?

1198
00:46:34,038 --> 00:46:35,155
And I want to go 
into Q and A now,

1199
00:46:35,155 --> 00:46:37,207
so, listen, I've clearly set the tone

1200
00:46:37,207 --> 00:46:40,267
for a direction of a
talk, they've got runners,

1201
00:46:40,267 --> 00:46:41,750
please go practical with me, right?

1202
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,010
Let's go into Q and A and like,

1203
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:45,184
please go practical, like
this transactional thing,

1204
00:46:45,184 --> 00:46:47,665
I'll answer any social 
one-on-one on this.

1205
00:46:47,665 --> 00:46:50,147
I highly recommend you
don't leave, at all,

1206
00:46:50,147 --> 00:46:51,732
that's a humongous mistake,

1207
00:46:51,732 --> 00:46:52,820
you're leaving a lot
of money on the table,

1208
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:57,270
but do your thing. (laughter)

1209
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:00,602
But I will say this, I will say this,

1210
00:47:00,602 --> 00:47:03,040
the best part for me 
about this whole talk

1211
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,945
is I'm gonna be historically correct

1212
00:47:05,945 --> 00:47:07,632
about what I just said,

1213
00:47:07,632 --> 00:47:10,050
this will get replayed and regurgitated

1214
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:12,081
and I'm gonna feel really good.

1215
00:47:12,081 --> 00:47:13,829
It feels fun for me when
I got made fun of

1216
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:17,914
that Facebook would 
never age up in 2007. Right?

1217
00:47:17,914 --> 00:47:19,396
When I said the grandma
thing is gonna happen,

1218
00:47:19,396 --> 00:47:21,285
I said, kids are gonna get older,

1219
00:47:21,285 --> 00:47:22,707
they're gonna have kids,
they're gonna put pictures

1220
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:23,531
on there, and the grandma

1221
00:47:23,531 --> 00:47:24,538
is gonna wanna see the pictures

1222
00:47:24,538 --> 00:47:25,776
and they're gonna start using it.

1223
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:27,253
It's fun for me to
stand here and tell you,

1224
00:47:27,253 --> 00:47:30,504
you will all be on 
Snapchat in 36 months

1225
00:47:30,504 --> 00:47:31,703
and you're like, "No way, man."

1226
00:47:31,703 --> 00:47:35,421
Cool, see you in 36
months, Rick! (laughter)

1227
00:47:35,421 --> 00:47:38,436
And so, (laughter)

1228
00:47:38,436 --> 00:47:40,633
and so, that's fun for me,

1229
00:47:40,633 --> 00:47:43,448
and so, I don't want this talk to just

1230
00:47:43,448 --> 00:47:46,597
be fun for me. I want it to
bring value for some of you.

1231
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:49,482
So, listen, it's not easy to go back,

1232
00:47:49,482 --> 00:47:51,270
it's not easy to invest.

1233
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:53,078
You know what really pisses me off,

1234
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,846
mainly on the collective?

1235
00:47:54,846 --> 00:47:57,629
Is people just don't
wanna put in the work.

1236
00:47:57,629 --> 00:48:01,266
Like, you can keep all the vulnerable

1237
00:48:01,266 --> 00:48:03,420
or bullcrap money that
you're making right now

1238
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,122
in parallel to learning this thing

1239
00:48:06,122 --> 00:48:08,702
that I'm telling you, by just working

1240
00:48:08,702 --> 00:48:11,364
four more hours a day,
instead of, you know?

1241
00:48:11,364 --> 00:48:13,030
I don't know, 
maybe you shouldn't rent

1242
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,062
expenive cars for the day,
so you can take

1243
00:48:15,062 --> 00:48:16,890
an Instagram photo 
and tell the world

1244
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:19,477
what kind of pimp 
entrepreneur you are.

1245
00:48:19,477 --> 00:48:20,785
(laughter)

1246
00:48:20,785 --> 00:48:24,015
Jesus!

1247
00:48:24,015 --> 00:48:25,733
Maybe that, right?

1248
00:48:25,733 --> 00:48:28,427
Maybe that would be 
a good goddamn idea?

1249
00:48:28,427 --> 00:48:30,601
(audience cheers)

1250
00:48:30,601 --> 00:48:31,942
(chuckles)

1251
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,222
Thank you.

1252
00:48:33,222 --> 00:48:37,276
(audience cheers)

1253
00:48:37,276 --> 00:48:39,064
Thank you.

1254
00:48:39,064 --> 00:48:40,445
- [Voiceover] Alright.

1255
00:48:40,445 --> 00:48:43,087
- [Gary] Thank you.

1256
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:44,184
Thank you.

1257
00:48:44,184 --> 00:48:48,578
(loud techno music)

1258
00:48:53,225 --> 00:48:54,090
Thank you.

1259
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:56,081
Alright, we got a lot of time.

1260
00:48:56,081 --> 00:48:57,239
We got a lot of time for Q and A

1261
00:48:57,239 --> 00:48:59,393
and then I also pushed back

1262
00:48:59,393 --> 00:49:00,957
a bunch of calls, so I think

1263
00:49:00,957 --> 00:49:03,398
I'm gonna do a little bit of a
book signing afterwards, too.

1264
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:06,660
(audience cheers) Not sure, so.

1265
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,183
And some selfies would be cool.

1266
00:49:08,183 --> 00:49:09,402
Alright.

1267
00:49:09,402 --> 00:49:11,170
- [Voiceover] Hi, Gary.

1268
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:12,099
- Where you at?
- [Voiceover] Right here,

1269
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:12,993
right here, right here.

1270
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:14,476
- Alright homie, what's your name?

1271
00:49:14,476 --> 00:49:15,736
- [Voiceover] Howard Partridge.

1272
00:49:15,736 --> 00:49:16,935
- Howard, how are you?

1273
00:49:16,935 --> 00:49:19,302
- [Voiceover] I am
phenomenal, how are you?

1274
00:49:19,302 --> 00:49:20,643
- Super great!

1275
00:49:20,643 --> 00:49:21,598
- Alright.

1276
00:49:21,598 --> 00:49:24,280
So you said that VR is the future,

1277
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,982
don't humans long for flesh

1278
00:49:26,982 --> 00:49:30,741
to flesh, true community, and if so,

1279
00:49:30,741 --> 00:49:32,651
how will those two coexist,

1280
00:49:32,651 --> 00:49:33,972
in your opinion, in the future?

1281
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:35,131
- I think humans do.

1282
00:49:35,131 --> 00:49:38,320
I think that when 
your brains get tricked,

1283
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,778
funny things happen, 
so I think, you know?

1284
00:49:40,778 --> 00:49:42,871
When testosterone 
and other chemicals

1285
00:49:42,871 --> 00:49:44,455
get lifted, you know?

1286
00:49:44,455 --> 00:49:46,000
Look, there's a bunch of dudes in here

1287
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,747
that know when their chemicals shift,

1288
00:49:47,747 --> 00:49:50,043
they become different versions
of themeselves, right?

1289
00:49:50,043 --> 00:49:52,948
So, I will tell you that, yes,

1290
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,452
and we're not gonna all live in pods

1291
00:49:54,452 --> 00:49:56,219
and not interact with each other,

1292
00:49:56,219 --> 00:49:58,190
but I would tell you right now,

1293
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:00,202
and I'm, don't forget,
I'm talking 20 years

1294
00:50:00,202 --> 00:50:01,482
from now, I think we're seeing

1295
00:50:01,482 --> 00:50:04,265
the early stages now, but I'm completely

1296
00:50:04,265 --> 00:50:06,073
convinced we're gonna
spend an enormous amount

1297
00:50:06,073 --> 00:50:08,166
of time, maybe not in our homes,

1298
00:50:08,166 --> 00:50:09,649
like, I'm actually, it's funny,

1299
00:50:09,649 --> 00:50:11,031
I'm trying to think about like,

1300
00:50:11,031 --> 00:50:12,575
should I invest in real estate

1301
00:50:12,575 --> 00:50:15,277
and convert 'em into resorts that?

1302
00:50:15,277 --> 00:50:16,792
I'm tryin' to figure it out, because

1303
00:50:16,792 --> 00:50:18,966
there's gonna be some
amazing businesses built

1304
00:50:18,966 --> 00:50:21,546
on the back of this new world

1305
00:50:21,546 --> 00:50:23,183
where you can have your.

1306
00:50:23,183 --> 00:50:25,926
I mean, bro, Howard, what if we all

1307
00:50:25,926 --> 00:50:27,990
literally felt we were right,

1308
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:29,676
what if this all felt real,

1309
00:50:29,676 --> 00:50:31,566
and we were just not here?

1310
00:50:31,566 --> 00:50:32,785
I mean, I know, I get it,

1311
00:50:32,785 --> 00:50:34,329
I get it, but I'm telling you,

1312
00:50:34,329 --> 00:50:37,397
sit here in 1988, let me be somebody

1313
00:50:37,397 --> 00:50:39,794
that told you about the Internet in 2016,

1314
00:50:39,794 --> 00:50:42,192
and they would never believe you.

1315
00:50:42,192 --> 00:50:43,533
Do you know how fast (snaps
fingers) things happen?

1316
00:50:43,533 --> 00:50:46,682
Internet dating was weird and taboo

1317
00:50:46,682 --> 00:50:50,107
seven years ago, now it is weird

1318
00:50:50,107 --> 00:50:52,849
and taboo to not Internet date.

1319
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:57,757
Shit changes fast! 
(laughter)

1320
00:50:57,757 --> 00:50:59,121
You're welcome.

1321
00:50:59,121 --> 00:51:03,033
(laughter)

1322
00:51:03,033 --> 00:51:04,679
Oh, we got a, we going this?

1323
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:06,498
- [Voiceover] Hey, Gary.
- Hey, brother.

1324
00:51:06,498 --> 00:51:07,645
- First of all, when I first heard

1325
00:51:07,645 --> 00:51:09,416
your story, I thought you were 22, so.

1326
00:51:09,416 --> 00:51:10,279
- [Gary] Thanks. (laughs)

1327
00:51:10,279 --> 00:51:11,773
- I'm so glad you're 38. (laughs)

1328
00:51:11,773 --> 00:51:12,969
- [Gary] I'm 40, goddamn it!

1329
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:14,629
(laughter)

1330
00:51:14,629 --> 00:51:15,909
- I'm 44, I've been-

1331
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:16,945
- [Gary] You look good, bro.

1332
00:51:16,945 --> 00:51:19,171
- My leads, thank you.

1333
00:51:19,171 --> 00:51:19,983
- [Gary] What's your name?

1334
00:51:19,983 --> 00:51:20,898
- My name is Mitch.

1335
00:51:20,898 --> 00:51:22,604
Chervis.
- [Gary] Mitch, awesome.

1336
00:51:22,604 --> 00:51:24,921
- [Mitch] Thanks.

1337
00:51:24,921 --> 00:51:26,648
(laughs) Thanks, you know my name,

1338
00:51:26,648 --> 00:51:28,305
I don't know what I said this for.

1339
00:51:28,305 --> 00:51:30,032
(laughter) Sorry.

1340
00:51:30,032 --> 00:51:31,800
I go from business to business,

1341
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,506
I get my leads, they send me work,

1342
00:51:33,506 --> 00:51:36,518
I have an auto glass
company here in the valley.

1343
00:51:36,518 --> 00:51:38,306
I don't do anything on the Internet.

1344
00:51:38,306 --> 00:51:39,394
- [Gary] Okay, that's a mistake.

1345
00:51:39,394 --> 00:51:40,485
- Yeah, it's huge, right?

1346
00:51:40,485 --> 00:51:42,354
- [Gary] This internet things 
got a chance!

1347
00:51:42,354 --> 00:51:44,357
- [Mitch] But I, and
I know it, it's I know

1348
00:51:44,357 --> 00:51:46,037
it's coming, but I don't know how,

1349
00:51:46,037 --> 00:51:47,398
like, I don't wanna be,

1350
00:51:47,398 --> 00:51:48,414
you ever watch The Office,

1351
00:51:48,414 --> 00:51:49,563
and there's like Bob Vance from Vance

1352
00:51:49,563 --> 00:51:51,372
Refrigeration.
- [Gary] I don't watch TV.

1353
00:51:51,372 --> 00:51:52,024
Ever!
- [Mitch] There's Bob Vance,

1354
00:51:52,024 --> 00:51:53,223
Vance Refrigeration, every time

1355
00:51:53,223 --> 00:51:54,535
he introduces himself, he's Bob Vance,

1356
00:51:54,535 --> 00:51:55,871
Vance Refrigeration.

1357
00:51:55,871 --> 00:51:56,619
I don't wanna be Mitch,

1358
00:51:56,619 --> 00:51:58,206
I'm on the Burton Auto Glass,

1359
00:51:58,206 --> 00:51:59,999
like, I don't wanna be that.
- [Gary] Got it!

1360
00:51:59,999 --> 00:52:01,015
- [Mitch] But can you,

1361
00:52:01,015 --> 00:52:03,656
can you have your
personal life on Facebook,

1362
00:52:03,656 --> 00:52:04,611
and your business life?

1363
00:52:04,611 --> 00:52:06,196
Can you have your personal Snapchat

1364
00:52:06,196 --> 00:52:07,304
and your business Snapchat,

1365
00:52:07,304 --> 00:52:09,072
and your personal Instagram?
- [Gary] Yep!

1366
00:52:09,072 --> 00:52:10,494
- [Mitch] Is it authentic?

1367
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,993
- [Gary] Sure!

1368
00:52:12,993 --> 00:52:13,695
- Like, can my business,

1369
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:16,092
I wanna be like (laughter),

1370
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:18,197
I don't know what they
call, you know what I mean?

1371
00:52:18,197 --> 00:52:19,688
Yes, that's the answer.
- [Gary] I think I know

1372
00:52:19,688 --> 00:52:22,885
what you mean, but I think
it's so ludicrous that all

1373
00:52:22,885 --> 00:52:24,827
I could give you is, sure!

1374
00:52:24,827 --> 00:52:26,371
- (laughs) It seems inauthentic to me,

1375
00:52:26,371 --> 00:52:28,626
because I'm authentic with my guys

1376
00:52:28,626 --> 00:52:30,373
that I go and get my business with now,

1377
00:52:30,373 --> 00:52:32,100
I'm authentic with them, and we sit

1378
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:32,901
and we chat and I--

1379
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:33,719
- [Gary] Can I ask you a question, Mitch?

1380
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:34,410
- Yeah.

1381
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:36,137
- Do you text other human beings?

1382
00:52:36,137 --> 00:52:36,909
- [Mitch] I do, all the time.

1383
00:52:36,909 --> 00:52:38,169
- Are you a fake, weird person

1384
00:52:38,169 --> 00:52:39,043
when you text?

1385
00:52:39,043 --> 00:52:39,896
- [Mitch] No.

1386
00:52:39,896 --> 00:52:40,932
- Okay, good.

1387
00:52:40,932 --> 00:52:43,262
So do that on the Internet
and business. (laughter)

1388
00:52:43,262 --> 00:52:46,919
Like it's a, your mind, you decided

1389
00:52:46,919 --> 00:52:48,890
to put your brain in a situation

1390
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:50,344
that makes you believe that.

1391
00:52:50,344 --> 00:52:51,624
- [Mitch] Yeah.

1392
00:52:51,624 --> 00:52:53,473
It's hard to--

1393
00:52:53,473 --> 00:52:54,732
- Everything's hard, Mitch!

1394
00:52:54,732 --> 00:52:56,450
- I know, (laughter)
like I don't wanna like,

1395
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:58,400
I don't wanna ruin my
personal relationships,

1396
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,843
I have personal relationships--

1397
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,887
- Oh, well Mitch, don't
sell your best friend

1398
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,081
on your service!

1399
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:05,849
Mitch, do you go to
your best friend's house

1400
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,409
every day and go, "Hey
bro, buy some glass!"

1401
00:53:08,409 --> 00:53:09,894
- Yeah, I don't.

1402
00:53:09,894 --> 00:53:11,796
I almost do the opposite,
I know what you're saying,

1403
00:53:11,796 --> 00:53:13,923
because I do shy away from my,

1404
00:53:13,923 --> 00:53:15,345
everybody says, "Oh,
go get your warm leads,

1405
00:53:15,345 --> 00:53:17,418
"go at your family, go
at your friends first,

1406
00:53:17,418 --> 00:53:18,677
"and then you'll go out
and get your thing."

1407
00:53:18,677 --> 00:53:19,518
But what you're saying is--

1408
00:53:19,518 --> 00:53:20,822
- [Gary] Mitch, those are 
people that just sell advice

1409
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:23,016
and never build an
actual goddamn business!

1410
00:53:23,016 --> 00:53:27,059
(audience cheers and applauds)

1411
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:27,823
Mitch.
- [Mitch] It's true.

1412
00:53:27,823 --> 00:53:29,340
- [Gary] You built a business,

1413
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:32,164
everything I do online is how I did it

1414
00:53:32,164 --> 00:53:34,419
20 years in real life.

1415
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:35,699
I never try to 
close on a first date,

1416
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:37,589
I wrote a book called,
Jab, Jab, Jab, Right-Hook,

1417
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:40,311
which was give, give, 
give, and then ask,

1418
00:53:40,311 --> 00:53:41,917
not take, ask.

1419
00:53:41,917 --> 00:53:44,781
So, just be a nice human there.

1420
00:53:44,781 --> 00:53:46,407
As a matter of fact, 
if you really understood

1421
00:53:46,407 --> 00:53:47,890
what I did with Wine Library TV,

1422
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:50,511
I educated people on it.

1423
00:53:50,511 --> 00:53:51,770
Why don't you educate people

1424
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:55,448
on your genre, put out
that content, whether they.

1425
00:53:55,448 --> 00:53:57,723
You know how many people bought wine

1426
00:53:57,723 --> 00:54:00,223
because of my videos, not for me?

1427
00:54:00,223 --> 00:54:03,534
Let me give you the
answer, most. (laughter)

1428
00:54:03,534 --> 00:54:06,541
Because I was looking 
to build a brand,

1429
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:08,898
not a transaction, 
so you can go

1430
00:54:08,898 --> 00:54:10,788
and educate people on.

1431
00:54:10,788 --> 00:54:12,068
Do you feel like your competitors

1432
00:54:12,068 --> 00:54:13,083
or other people in the marketplace

1433
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,973
are selling less quality stuff,

1434
00:54:14,973 --> 00:54:16,456
bad advice and other things?

1435
00:54:16,456 --> 00:54:17,147
- Absolutely!

1436
00:54:17,147 --> 00:54:21,434
- [Gary] Then teach America,
Mitch! (audience cheers)

1437
00:54:21,434 --> 00:54:24,217
- Thank you.

1438
00:54:24,217 --> 00:54:25,071
- That feels good, right?

1439
00:54:25,071 --> 00:54:26,404
That feels authentic?
- [Mitch] Yeah, yeah.

1440
00:54:26,404 --> 00:54:27,561
- You don't feel like a scum bucket

1441
00:54:27,561 --> 00:54:29,336
doin' that, do you Mitch?
- [Mitch] No I don't.

1442
00:54:29,336 --> 00:54:30,895
- No, okay! 
(Mitch laughs)

1443
00:54:30,895 --> 00:54:31,891
So do that!

1444
00:54:31,891 --> 00:54:32,663
- [Mitch] Thank you.

1445
00:54:32,663 --> 00:54:33,924
- You don't all of a
sudden go on the Internet

1446
00:54:33,924 --> 00:54:35,874
and turn into something like jerkoff.

1447
00:54:35,874 --> 00:54:36,673
- [Mitch] That's what I
feel like, I'm gonna go

1448
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:37,525
on there be like, "Hey, everybody,

1449
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:38,203
"love Auto Glass!"

1450
00:54:38,203 --> 00:54:39,559
I can just be yourself.
- [Gary] This is what

1451
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:41,205
everybody's confused about with money

1452
00:54:41,205 --> 00:54:42,691
and fame and notoriety, like,

1453
00:54:42,691 --> 00:54:44,385
I get credit now, like,

1454
00:54:44,385 --> 00:54:46,084
"Oh, Gary, you're so nice."

1455
00:54:46,084 --> 00:54:47,669
I'm like, what?

1456
00:54:47,669 --> 00:54:50,798
Money and fame or notoriety

1457
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:54,446
doesn't change you, it just exposes you.

1458
00:54:54,446 --> 00:54:56,173
The Internet's not
gonna change you, Mitch,

1459
00:54:56,173 --> 00:54:59,154
it's just gonna expose
how awesome you are!

1460
00:54:59,154 --> 00:55:00,715
- [Mitch] Thank you.

1461
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:04,488
(audience applauds and cheers)

1462
00:55:04,488 --> 00:55:06,505
- Where are we goin'?

1463
00:55:06,505 --> 00:55:07,335
- Right over here.

1464
00:55:07,335 --> 00:55:08,696
(laughter)

1465
00:55:08,696 --> 00:55:10,173
Hey, Gary, I'm Matt, I'm a long-time--

1466
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:11,961
- Matt, your crew is hyped,

1467
00:55:11,961 --> 00:55:14,584
you guys feel. (audience
cheers and screams)

1468
00:55:14,584 --> 00:55:16,718
You guys feel like 
you're good people,

1469
00:55:16,718 --> 00:55:17,635
(Matt laughs) you're gonna be the ones,

1470
00:55:17,635 --> 00:55:18,602
I've been watching your vibe

1471
00:55:18,602 --> 00:55:19,345
on this talk.
- [Matt] We're the brands man,

1472
00:55:19,345 --> 00:55:21,199
we're the brands.
- [Gary] Okay.

1473
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:23,122
- [Matt] So, my name's Matt,
I'm a long-time lurker,

1474
00:55:23,122 --> 00:55:25,417
but now I've seen every
single #AskGaryVee Show,

1475
00:55:25,417 --> 00:55:27,023
DailyVee, I'm lovin' it.

1476
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:27,713
- [Gary] Thank you, bro.

1477
00:55:27,713 --> 00:55:29,118
- We run, my wife and I--

1478
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:30,404
- So wait a minute, let's
break this down for a second.

1479
00:55:30,404 --> 00:55:31,271
- [Matt] Yeah man.

1480
00:55:31,271 --> 00:55:33,726
- You mean you've
consumed all this content,

1481
00:55:33,726 --> 00:55:36,550
for free, I very often say on the show

1482
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:38,277
please leave one comment,

1483
00:55:38,277 --> 00:55:39,841
it's my oxygen, and you've decided

1484
00:55:39,841 --> 00:55:41,873
to never, (laughter) you didn't pay,

1485
00:55:41,873 --> 00:55:43,702
and you never, ever wanted to leave

1486
00:55:43,702 --> 00:55:44,575
one comment?

1487
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:45,557
- No, no, not at all.

1488
00:55:45,557 --> 00:55:49,377
So, when I started watching. 
(laughter)

1489
00:55:49,377 --> 00:55:51,429
When I started watching you,

1490
00:55:51,429 --> 00:55:54,192
I was 50 episodes in, is
when I heard about you,

1491
00:55:54,192 --> 00:55:56,407
so I watched all 50 episodes

1492
00:55:56,407 --> 00:55:57,942
and then, I remember it being,

1493
00:55:57,942 --> 00:55:59,952
it was like 57 or something,

1494
00:55:59,952 --> 00:56:02,410
and you were like, you
started it by going,

1495
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:03,853
"We got a lot of lurkers here,

1496
00:56:03,853 --> 00:56:05,092
"you guys need to leave a comment."

1497
00:56:05,092 --> 00:56:06,952
And that was the first show I
left a comment on. (loud clap)

1498
00:56:06,952 --> 00:56:07,869
- [Gary] Alright bro, good, thank you!

1499
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:10,440
- And then, from then
on, when an episode

1500
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,300
spoke to me, I left a
comment, I shared it--

1501
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,783
- Respect, meritocracy!

1502
00:56:13,783 --> 00:56:15,124
Don't give it to me if I don't deserve it.

1503
00:56:15,124 --> 00:56:16,288
- [Matt] Yeah, man.
- Alright.

1504
00:56:16,288 --> 00:56:18,633
- Okay, so, my wife and I, we run

1505
00:56:18,633 --> 00:56:20,848
an online school for
wedding photographers,

1506
00:56:20,848 --> 00:56:21,945
we are wedding photographers,

1507
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:24,801
we're educators, as is
our whole crew here,

1508
00:56:24,801 --> 00:56:27,462
so, my question is, we've built it

1509
00:56:27,462 --> 00:56:28,916
to a spot that we're really comfortable

1510
00:56:28,916 --> 00:56:30,704
with right now, but we can either

1511
00:56:30,704 --> 00:56:33,244
keep it niched down and build it more,

1512
00:56:33,244 --> 00:56:35,490
with that, our audience, which is

1513
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:38,497
a money audience in the
scheme of everybody.

1514
00:56:38,497 --> 00:56:39,960
Or, we can use the framework

1515
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,316
we've build, the system
we've built online,

1516
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:44,917
rebrand it, repackage
it for another industry,

1517
00:56:44,917 --> 00:56:46,310
who can I meet some 
of you guys out there

1518
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:48,913
who need education 
in other industries.

1519
00:56:48,913 --> 00:56:51,127
What do I do, do I go still with the niche

1520
00:56:51,127 --> 00:56:53,281
or do I build bigger, now
that I've got a system?

1521
00:56:53,281 --> 00:56:54,520
- It's a personal
question, but the answer's

1522
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,665
both can work, I think, if you go

1523
00:56:56,665 --> 00:56:58,290
into other genres, you need to make

1524
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,976
sure you spend it an
ungodly amount of time

1525
00:56:59,976 --> 00:57:01,683
vetting who your partner is

1526
00:57:01,683 --> 00:57:04,243
around their expertise,
because what people

1527
00:57:04,243 --> 00:57:05,575
normally do in this moment,

1528
00:57:05,575 --> 00:57:07,810
is there's so excited 
about going wide,

1529
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:09,496
that the first person, they like,

1530
00:57:09,496 --> 00:57:11,284
they back to like 
being romantic about it,

1531
00:57:11,284 --> 00:57:13,072
like, "Oh, John's a good enough guy

1532
00:57:13,072 --> 00:57:15,185
"and seems like he knows
enough about pastries,

1533
00:57:15,185 --> 00:57:17,004
"good, he's our pastry guy." Right?

1534
00:57:17,004 --> 00:57:19,342
So, I would tell you,
if you wanna feel good,

1535
00:57:19,342 --> 00:57:20,520
and you wanna do the right thing,

1536
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,375
that you spend an enormous amount of time

1537
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:26,362
on vetting people in, and
then, more importantly,

1538
00:57:26,362 --> 00:57:28,455
and this is back to hiring and firing,

1539
00:57:28,455 --> 00:57:30,080
people are always crippled by hiring,

1540
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,234
I'll hire anybody.

1541
00:57:32,234 --> 00:57:33,555
You could even walk into my office

1542
00:57:33,555 --> 00:57:35,679
with a Patriots jersey,
and I'll still hire you.

1543
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:36,491
(laughter)

1544
00:57:36,491 --> 00:57:37,284
Yep!

1545
00:57:37,284 --> 00:57:38,239
True.

1546
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:41,083
But, 'cause it's not about hiring,

1547
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:43,524
it's about firing, right?
- [Matt] Yeah.

1548
00:57:43,524 --> 00:57:45,860
- [Gary] So, after you made a gut call,

1549
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,944
Rick's the best tire guy you ever met,

1550
00:57:47,944 --> 00:57:49,915
he's gonna be in the tire genre,

1551
00:57:49,915 --> 00:57:51,674
then you watch, and if you don't like

1552
00:57:51,674 --> 00:57:54,051
how Rick goes, and this is where everybody

1553
00:57:54,051 --> 00:57:56,652
goes to the dark side, Rick becomes

1554
00:57:56,652 --> 00:57:58,541
the best salesperson.

1555
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:02,097
You know, 'cause Rick's getting
a little black hat, right?

1556
00:58:02,097 --> 00:58:03,632
Converting a little of this,

1557
00:58:03,632 --> 00:58:05,724
and he's your biggest
earner, by percentage,

1558
00:58:05,724 --> 00:58:07,797
'cause you're making a vig on Rick,

1559
00:58:07,797 --> 00:58:09,666
'cause he's on your platform,

1560
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:10,887
and that's when you, even though

1561
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:12,565
Rick's the number one person,

1562
00:58:12,565 --> 00:58:13,775
if he's doin' the wrong thing,

1563
00:58:13,775 --> 00:58:15,067
you've got to cut him.

1564
00:58:15,067 --> 00:58:16,855
And that's the part that nobody does.

1565
00:58:16,855 --> 00:58:18,094
- [Matt] Yeah.

1566
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:21,206
- Nobody devalues currency over legacy.

1567
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:23,161
- [Matt] Yeah.
- And unfortunately, that's most.

1568
00:58:23,161 --> 00:58:24,172
- Yeah.

1569
00:58:24,172 --> 00:58:25,600
Which is, I mean, I'm glad you said it,

1570
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,732
'cause that's exactly why we chose

1571
00:58:26,732 --> 00:58:27,719
the people that are sitting here

1572
00:58:27,719 --> 00:58:30,645
to be our educators 
in our first academy,

1573
00:58:30,645 --> 00:58:32,331
because they're people 
that we've known

1574
00:58:32,331 --> 00:58:33,367
for a long time, we know--
- [Gary] Of course, that's

1575
00:58:33,367 --> 00:58:34,911
the easiest thing to vet.
- [Matt] Yeah,

1576
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:36,374
and, they're the best.

1577
00:58:36,374 --> 00:58:37,573
So, how would I actually reach out

1578
00:58:37,573 --> 00:58:38,568
to people in industries

1579
00:58:38,568 --> 00:58:40,226
that I am not an expert in

1580
00:58:40,226 --> 00:58:43,395
and find those people who
should be the educators in that?

1581
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:46,505
- [Gary] It's called work,
so what you'll do (laughter).

1582
00:58:46,505 --> 00:58:47,950
- I'm ready for that!

1583
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:49,250
- Yeah, I'm sure, you did it,

1584
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:52,074
I mean, that's what's so great
about today's world, right?

1585
00:58:52,074 --> 00:58:54,248
You can literally type in into Google

1586
00:58:54,248 --> 00:58:56,239
any subject matter, see the first

1587
00:58:56,239 --> 00:58:57,763
three pages results, click 'em,

1588
00:58:57,763 --> 00:58:59,867
lists, go on Twitter, see how they roll,

1589
00:58:59,867 --> 00:59:02,296
you can watch 
them from afar, you know?

1590
00:59:02,296 --> 00:59:03,323
Since you've been watching as much

1591
00:59:03,323 --> 00:59:05,369
of my content, I'm sure you know,

1592
00:59:05,369 --> 00:59:06,661
I mean, I feel very confident right now

1593
00:59:06,661 --> 00:59:09,221
that you'll know how to
sniff out certain things.

1594
00:59:09,221 --> 00:59:10,277
Just put in the work.

1595
00:59:10,277 --> 00:59:11,943
What I would do if I were you

1596
00:59:11,943 --> 00:59:13,995
is to try to think about the marketplace

1597
00:59:13,995 --> 00:59:16,068
that is either the hottest,

1598
00:59:16,068 --> 00:59:19,197
or the most profitable,
like, make a business

1599
00:59:19,197 --> 00:59:21,330
decision on which 
sector you go into next.

1600
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:23,809
i also think, a compliment
to your core thing

1601
00:59:23,809 --> 00:59:27,628
is smart, so whether that's catering

1602
00:59:27,628 --> 00:59:29,663
or filming or I just, I don't know,

1603
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,862
I would think about that, too.

1604
00:59:30,862 --> 00:59:31,532
- [Matt] Yeah.

1605
00:59:31,532 --> 00:59:32,162
- Cool.

1606
00:59:32,162 --> 00:59:33,158
- [Matt] So when it's marketing,

1607
00:59:33,158 --> 00:59:34,397
and we give you a call,

1608
00:59:34,397 --> 00:59:37,346
and say, we vetted we for quite awhile.

1609
00:59:37,346 --> 00:59:38,240
- Yes.

1610
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,296
- [Matt] My name's Matt Kennedy.

1611
00:59:39,296 --> 00:59:39,926
- Yes.

1612
00:59:39,926 --> 00:59:40,759
Done. (laughter)

1613
00:59:40,759 --> 00:59:41,795
Thank you brother.

1614
00:59:41,795 --> 00:59:43,526
Appreciate it man.

1615
00:59:45,053 --> 00:59:46,516
Who's next?

1616
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:47,898
- [Voiceover] Straight in
front of you, in the back.

1617
00:59:47,898 --> 00:59:48,914
- Let's go to.

1618
00:59:48,914 --> 00:59:50,878
Oh, I get to pick?

1619
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:51,752
Oh, this is fun.

1620
00:59:51,752 --> 00:59:55,327
Okay. (laughter)

1621
00:59:55,327 --> 00:59:55,957
Hello.

1622
00:59:55,957 --> 00:59:56,668
- [Voiceover] Hi.

1623
00:59:56,668 --> 00:59:57,411
- [Gary] How are you?

1624
00:59:57,411 --> 00:59:57,879
- I'm good.

1625
00:59:57,879 --> 00:59:59,301
- [Gary] Good, could you
put your mic to your mouth?

1626
00:59:59,301 --> 00:59:59,916
- Okay.

1627
00:59:59,916 --> 01:00:01,277
- [Garry] Awesome, what's your name?

1628
01:00:01,277 --> 01:00:01,861
- Terry.

1629
01:00:01,861 --> 01:00:03,182
- [Garry] Terry.

1630
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:06,229
- I didn't, I've never followed you, so,

1631
01:00:06,229 --> 01:00:07,817
I apologize.
- [Gary] Huge mistake, Terry!

1632
01:00:07,817 --> 01:00:09,702
Huge! (laughter)

1633
01:00:09,702 --> 01:00:11,693
But I knew it, I could, I knew that's

1634
01:00:11,693 --> 01:00:14,110
what you were gonna say.
- [Terry] I subscribed

1635
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,737
to your channel.

1636
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:17,403
- [Gary] Thank you so much! 
(laughter)

1637
01:00:17,403 --> 01:00:18,811
- Okay, my question is,

1638
01:00:18,811 --> 01:00:20,680
you were talking is,

1639
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,529
I know that everything's mobile.

1640
01:00:22,529 --> 01:00:24,236
- [Gary] Yes!

1641
01:00:24,236 --> 01:00:27,060
- So why are we developing websites?

1642
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,722
- Well, because mobile devices deliver

1643
01:00:29,722 --> 01:00:31,440
us websites, darlin'.

1644
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,553
- [Terry] No, but I
mean, on the big screen.

1645
01:00:33,553 --> 01:00:34,894
- Well, we shouldn't.

1646
01:00:34,894 --> 01:00:36,824
When we design our websites today,

1647
01:00:36,824 --> 01:00:38,980
anybody in here who's 
when they're designing

1648
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,053
the UI and the UX, as it's called,

1649
01:00:41,053 --> 01:00:43,458
should be designing 
for a mobile device,

1650
01:00:43,458 --> 01:00:45,124
not for a laptop.

1651
01:00:45,124 --> 01:00:48,171
- 'Cause I've seen lots of money spent

1652
01:00:48,171 --> 01:00:49,776
on beautiful designs--

1653
01:00:49,776 --> 01:00:50,377
- [Gary] That's right!

1654
01:00:50,377 --> 01:00:51,802
- That show great on a web page.

1655
01:00:51,802 --> 01:00:53,229
- That's right, those are
people that are not as good

1656
01:00:53,229 --> 01:00:57,364
at business. 
(laughter)

1657
01:00:57,364 --> 01:00:59,066
It's just true.

1658
01:00:59,066 --> 01:01:01,047
- [Terry] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1659
01:01:01,047 --> 01:01:01,852
Cool.

1660
01:01:01,852 --> 01:01:03,478
Number three, let's do it.

1661
01:01:03,478 --> 01:01:04,433
- Hey, Gary.

1662
01:01:04,433 --> 01:01:05,977
Matt Rickets, I've seen you at

1663
01:01:05,977 --> 01:01:07,216
several live events this year,

1664
01:01:07,216 --> 01:01:10,528
I was at Thrive, that
was a pretty good one.

1665
01:01:10,528 --> 01:01:11,971
I love that you customize the message

1666
01:01:11,971 --> 01:01:13,129
for each audience.

1667
01:01:13,129 --> 01:01:14,995
- [Gary] Appreciate it man.
- [Matt] Very different kinda

1668
01:01:14,995 --> 01:01:18,226
vibe tonight than Thrive
and Digital Marketer

1669
01:01:18,226 --> 01:01:19,323
at their event, so.

1670
01:01:19,323 --> 01:01:20,472
- It's mainly, I basically

1671
01:01:20,472 --> 01:01:21,733
have a good speaking career

1672
01:01:21,733 --> 01:01:23,877
because I really give a
crap about you, right?

1673
01:01:23,877 --> 01:01:24,741
It's literally you, right?

1674
01:01:24,741 --> 01:01:26,712
Like, there's people, how many people

1675
01:01:26,712 --> 01:01:28,135
have seen me more than once this year?

1676
01:01:28,135 --> 01:01:28,846
- [Voiceover] Wooh!

1677
01:01:28,846 --> 01:01:29,792
- Right, so I'm scared of that.

1678
01:01:29,792 --> 01:01:31,072
I'm scared of that, right?

1679
01:01:31,072 --> 01:01:32,891
Because most of my
friends and contemporaries

1680
01:01:32,891 --> 01:01:35,126
have the same slides, it's the same talk,

1681
01:01:35,126 --> 01:01:36,975
and so, I have no interest in you looking

1682
01:01:36,975 --> 01:01:38,632
at your phone while I'm on stage,

1683
01:01:38,632 --> 01:01:40,075
so that's why I do it.

1684
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:41,680
- Yeah, so, what I wanna do

1685
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,179
is ask you a tactical question (mumbles).

1686
01:01:43,179 --> 01:01:44,695
- [Gary] Sure.

1687
01:01:44,695 --> 01:01:46,536
- Facebook, you talked about.
- [Gary] Yes.

1688
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,018
- Using it extensively in my business,

1689
01:01:48,018 --> 01:01:49,980
it's unusual in the
house cleaning industry.

1690
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:50,656
- [Gary] House cleaning, okay.

1691
01:01:50,656 --> 01:01:53,213
- Not many people are marketing well.

1692
01:01:53,213 --> 01:01:53,639
- [Gary] Yes!

1693
01:01:53,639 --> 01:01:55,949
- But are you using the new lead ads

1694
01:01:55,949 --> 01:01:58,123
from Facebook effectively,
or are you still taking

1695
01:01:58,123 --> 01:01:59,475
them off-site to capture leads?

1696
01:01:59,475 --> 01:02:00,491
Are you doing it right in the--

1697
01:02:00,491 --> 01:02:01,182
- Both!

1698
01:02:01,182 --> 01:02:03,143
I actually think the phone call ads

1699
01:02:03,143 --> 01:02:04,791
are really incredible.

1700
01:02:04,791 --> 01:02:05,218
- [Matt] Okay.

1701
01:02:05,218 --> 01:02:06,539
- 'Cause people are mobile devices

1702
01:02:06,539 --> 01:02:08,431
and just press the phone number.

1703
01:02:08,431 --> 01:02:11,926
And the phone is an amazing closer.

1704
01:02:11,926 --> 01:02:13,165
I test everything, man.

1705
01:02:13,165 --> 01:02:14,771
I'm day trading attention, so what I,

1706
01:02:14,771 --> 01:02:16,619
by the way, when somebody watch,

1707
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:18,164
hey, whoever's watching this,

1708
01:02:18,164 --> 01:02:20,094
when you watch this in six months,

1709
01:02:20,094 --> 01:02:22,837
whatever my answer 
is now may change.

1710
01:02:22,837 --> 01:02:24,320
I'm changing my, this used to drive

1711
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,539
my poor dad crazy.

1712
01:02:25,539 --> 01:02:27,550
My dad's a real (spits
loudly) word his bond,

1713
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:29,379
stick forever, so like,
when I would change

1714
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:31,736
my decisions, he'd be
like, "But you said,"

1715
01:02:31,736 --> 01:02:32,873
I'm like, yeah, but I changed my mind,

1716
01:02:32,873 --> 01:02:33,747
he'd be like, "What the?"

1717
01:02:33,747 --> 01:02:35,799
He would be so pissed.
(laughter)

1718
01:02:35,799 --> 01:02:38,887
So, I'm using them all, depends

1719
01:02:38,887 --> 01:02:41,021
on the, but remember,
let's take it step back

1720
01:02:41,021 --> 01:02:45,612
for everybody, creative is
the variable of success,

1721
01:02:45,612 --> 01:02:48,579
the words and the pictures and the video

1722
01:02:48,579 --> 01:02:51,017
will impact the success.

1723
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:54,349
So, we could talk about the functionality,

1724
01:02:54,349 --> 01:02:55,751
is it a click out to a website?

1725
01:02:55,751 --> 01:02:58,729
Is it a, within it's lead
gen, is it a phone number?

1726
01:02:58,729 --> 01:03:01,375
But if the creative isn't good,

1727
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,773
so, the reason I start with
day trading attention is,

1728
01:03:03,773 --> 01:03:07,044
Facebook's attention is still underpriced,

1729
01:03:07,044 --> 01:03:08,019
even though it's more expensive

1730
01:03:08,019 --> 01:03:10,762
than it was 24 months ago, mainly because

1731
01:03:10,762 --> 01:03:13,710
a room like this is still
not spending enough on it.

1732
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:16,372
And corporate America,
forget those losers, right?

1733
01:03:16,372 --> 01:03:19,663
So, you start there, but then there's

1734
01:03:19,663 --> 01:03:21,106
a whole 'nother conversation,

1735
01:03:21,106 --> 01:03:22,803
it's why I wrote Jab,
Jab, Jab, Right-Hook,

1736
01:03:22,803 --> 01:03:25,140
because I was like,
look, this is important.

1737
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:28,452
So, I would tell you,
first, need to try 30

1738
01:03:28,452 --> 01:03:30,240
to 50, 100 different variables,

1739
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,149
different times, different
cadences, different,

1740
01:03:32,149 --> 01:03:33,145
before you say.

1741
01:03:33,145 --> 01:03:34,303
You know how many people here,

1742
01:03:34,303 --> 01:03:35,209
you know how many people here

1743
01:03:35,209 --> 01:03:37,272
poo-pooed Facebook ads after spending

1744
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:41,254
their first thousand
or $10,000 on Facebook?

1745
01:03:41,254 --> 01:03:43,358
Losing players, bro.

1746
01:03:43,358 --> 01:03:44,394
- And then one last thing.

1747
01:03:44,394 --> 01:03:46,223
Do you still anticipate putting out

1748
01:03:46,223 --> 01:03:49,149
that evergreen product
for small businesses

1749
01:03:49,149 --> 01:03:50,455
or is that more of a long-term plan?

1750
01:03:50,455 --> 01:03:51,424
- [Gary] You mean the VaynerMedia side?

1751
01:03:51,424 --> 01:03:53,284
- Yeah, we talked a little bit about that.

1752
01:03:53,284 --> 01:03:55,075
- He's referring to, I'm,

1753
01:03:55,075 --> 01:03:56,355
it's weird you said that,
I was thinking about it

1754
01:03:56,355 --> 01:03:58,082
most of the flight here today.

1755
01:03:58,082 --> 01:04:01,394
I'm fascinated that my
brand is much stronger

1756
01:04:01,394 --> 01:04:03,547
in rooms like this than
it is corporate America.

1757
01:04:03,547 --> 01:04:05,997
I built VaynerMedia
from zero to 100 million

1758
01:04:05,997 --> 01:04:08,294
in four years, in revenue, in an industry

1759
01:04:08,294 --> 01:04:09,422
that didn't even know who I was,

1760
01:04:09,422 --> 01:04:11,718
or liked me or buy 
what I want or has no.

1761
01:04:11,718 --> 01:04:14,623
Like, this, so, when I think about

1762
01:04:14,623 --> 01:04:16,402
where am I leaving a billion dollars

1763
01:04:16,402 --> 01:04:18,028
potentially on the table it's building

1764
01:04:18,028 --> 01:04:20,750
a SaaS product 
around my core strength

1765
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:22,355
for businesses of this nature.

1766
01:04:22,355 --> 01:04:24,407
So, I think about it a lot. (laughs)

1767
01:04:24,407 --> 01:04:27,353
I just, I'm pretty intuitive

1768
01:04:27,353 --> 01:04:28,918
and I do things when I
feel like they're ready

1769
01:04:28,918 --> 01:04:31,051
but it's on my mind.

1770
01:04:31,051 --> 01:04:32,209
Because I know I can win,

1771
01:04:32,209 --> 01:04:35,135
I know that I can get $60,000
out of every person here,

1772
01:04:35,135 --> 01:04:36,903
and bring them back more.

1773
01:04:36,903 --> 01:04:39,320
I just haven't put 
it all together yet,

1774
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,661
because I won't launch it,

1775
01:04:40,661 --> 01:04:42,998
even at the height of 
my career right now,

1776
01:04:42,998 --> 01:04:45,680
separated myself from the
other social media people

1777
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,610
would be really easy for me to convert,

1778
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:49,357
I care so much about lifetime value

1779
01:04:49,357 --> 01:04:51,816
and legacy, that until
the final little piece

1780
01:04:51,816 --> 01:04:53,746
clicks in my head 
where I know even

1781
01:04:53,746 --> 01:04:55,545
the worst practitioners in here

1782
01:04:55,545 --> 01:04:58,227
will feel good about the
investment they made on it,

1783
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:01,356
I'm just not there yet.

1784
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:04,911
Four!

1785
01:05:04,911 --> 01:05:05,643
- [Voiceover] Hi, Gary, thanks--

1786
01:05:05,643 --> 01:05:07,846
- I'm super into this. (chuckles)
(audience laughter)

1787
01:05:07,846 --> 01:05:09,851
Four!

1788
01:05:09,851 --> 01:05:10,724
What's up bro?

1789
01:05:10,724 --> 01:05:13,408
- First of all, thanks
so much for all you do.

1790
01:05:13,408 --> 01:05:14,221
- [Gary] What's your name?

1791
01:05:14,221 --> 01:05:14,831
- Jared.

1792
01:05:14,831 --> 01:05:15,785
- [Gary] Jared, thanks man.

1793
01:05:15,785 --> 01:05:18,203
- So, I currently use Facebook,

1794
01:05:18,203 --> 01:05:20,438
Twitter, a little bit of Youtube

1795
01:05:20,438 --> 01:05:23,277
and Periscope for one
of my businesses and--

1796
01:05:23,277 --> 01:05:24,680
- [Gary] What kind of business?

1797
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:27,487
- I'm a physical therapy
private practice owner,

1798
01:05:27,487 --> 01:05:28,462
and.
- [Voiceover] Yeah!

1799
01:05:28,462 --> 01:05:29,672
- Thank you. (laughter)

1800
01:05:29,672 --> 01:05:30,668
And I--

1801
01:05:30,668 --> 01:05:32,447
- [Gary] People love to be heard, wooo!

1802
01:05:32,447 --> 01:05:35,637
- I also teach, I have an
online business teaching

1803
01:05:35,637 --> 01:05:37,173
about private practice.

1804
01:05:37,173 --> 01:05:38,961
And so, my question is,

1805
01:05:38,961 --> 01:05:41,076
that I'm already feeling really stretched

1806
01:05:41,076 --> 01:05:42,884
just to do those four platforms--

1807
01:05:42,884 --> 01:05:43,656
- [Gary] Makes sense.

1808
01:05:43,656 --> 01:05:46,674
- Especially in the way that
you advised to have content,

1809
01:05:46,674 --> 01:05:48,852
native for each platform.
- [Gary] Yes, yep.

1810
01:05:48,852 --> 01:05:50,123
- So, my question is--
- [Gary] What do you do about

1811
01:05:50,123 --> 01:05:51,534
it, right? Deep or wide, right?

1812
01:05:51,534 --> 01:05:52,748
- [Jared] Exactly, do I go deeper--

1813
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:54,094
- So, here's my first question,

1814
01:05:54,094 --> 01:05:56,796
how many hours a day are you working?

1815
01:05:56,796 --> 01:05:57,852
- 10 or 12.

1816
01:05:57,852 --> 01:05:59,742
- [Gary] Are you pumped
where you are financially,

1817
01:05:59,742 --> 01:06:01,753
like are you at a spot where you're good,

1818
01:06:01,753 --> 01:06:03,785
you're happy, like, you're good?

1819
01:06:03,785 --> 01:06:05,674
- I'm happy, but I want more.

1820
01:06:05,674 --> 01:06:07,503
- [Gary] Good, so work 12 to 14.

1821
01:06:07,503 --> 01:06:08,214
- Yeah.

1822
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,514
- [Gary] That's the answer, bro.

1823
01:06:09,514 --> 01:06:10,980
- Can I ask one follow-up though,

1824
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:11,885
in terms of--
- [Gary] Sure!

1825
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:14,059
- Do you feel like 
it's more important

1826
01:06:14,059 --> 01:06:16,213
to put that extra time 
into the platforms

1827
01:06:16,213 --> 01:06:17,391
I'm already on, or do you feel

1828
01:06:17,391 --> 01:06:20,512
that Instagram and Snapchat
are so important now

1829
01:06:20,512 --> 01:06:21,528
and moving forward

1830
01:06:21,528 --> 01:06:23,210
that I need to add those in?
- [Gary] It'a good question.

1831
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:24,817
It's a good question, it's
the right follow-up question,

1832
01:06:24,817 --> 01:06:25,670
so good job.

1833
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:27,214
I would look at the conversion,

1834
01:06:27,214 --> 01:06:29,034
I would look at your business,

1835
01:06:29,034 --> 01:06:31,939
and if I felt like there is a moment

1836
01:06:31,939 --> 01:06:35,413
where if Twitter doesn't
bring enough revenue in,

1837
01:06:35,413 --> 01:06:37,526
and it's disproportionate
to the amount of time

1838
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:38,278
that you're spending on it

1839
01:06:38,278 --> 01:06:39,660
that you can jump off.

1840
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:43,105
I've jumped off Tumblr and Google+, right?

1841
01:06:43,105 --> 01:06:44,405
They became a time,

1842
01:06:44,405 --> 01:06:47,209
so, yeah, there is a time,

1843
01:06:47,209 --> 01:06:50,074
but, I still want you to work more,

1844
01:06:50,074 --> 01:06:53,040
if you're not content, you know?

1845
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,564
Content is content, you know?

1846
01:06:54,564 --> 01:06:57,318
Like, either you want more or you don't.

1847
01:06:57,318 --> 01:07:00,916
Like, it's a binary game, like, and so,

1848
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:02,908
you have to give up other things

1849
01:07:02,908 --> 01:07:04,188
and deploy more of this,

1850
01:07:04,188 --> 01:07:06,240
if you want more, or maybe

1851
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,479
and there's nothing wrong with that,

1852
01:07:07,479 --> 01:07:09,231
as a matter of fact, I,

1853
01:07:09,231 --> 01:07:10,470
this is not a joke, and a lot of people

1854
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:11,791
would not believe this,

1855
01:07:11,791 --> 01:07:13,985
if there was a drug that I could take

1856
01:07:13,985 --> 01:07:15,865
and there probably is, but I'm
scared of drugs (laughter),

1857
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,547
but, if there was, 
yeah, maybe a shot,

1858
01:07:18,547 --> 01:07:19,441
I'm scared of those, too.

1859
01:07:19,441 --> 01:07:22,987
But, I wouldn't mind to take
some ambition out of my body.

1860
01:07:22,987 --> 01:07:24,565
I wouldn't. You know?

1861
01:07:24,572 --> 01:07:26,645
I wouldn't mind to have a
little more work-life balance,

1862
01:07:26,645 --> 01:07:27,356
you know what I mean?

1863
01:07:27,356 --> 01:07:30,208
Like so, but, extra time

1864
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:33,511
fixes all vulnerabilities.

1865
01:07:34,843 --> 01:07:35,517
Cool.

1866
01:07:35,517 --> 01:07:37,264
One.

1867
01:07:37,264 --> 01:07:38,403
- [Voiceover] Gary.
- Yes.

1868
01:07:38,403 --> 01:07:39,153
- [Voiceover] Thank you, man.

1869
01:07:39,153 --> 01:07:40,567
- You're welcome, bro.

1870
01:07:40,567 --> 01:07:41,779
- I got three questions for you,

1871
01:07:41,779 --> 01:07:43,059
first one is,

1872
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:43,953
- [Gary] What's your name?
- [Man] Which wine

1873
01:07:43,953 --> 01:07:45,757
pairs best with fish?
- [Gary] Fish?

1874
01:07:45,757 --> 01:07:46,456
(laughter)

1875
01:07:46,456 --> 01:07:47,291
- [Man] That's first question.

1876
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:49,653
- [Gary] Spanish White Riojas.

1877
01:07:49,653 --> 01:07:50,791
- Okay, perfect.
- [Gary] Good.

1878
01:07:50,791 --> 01:07:51,667
- [Man] I'll make a note of that,

1879
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:52,805
said on Facebook last night

1880
01:07:52,805 --> 01:07:54,419
I was gonna ask that question today.

1881
01:07:54,419 --> 01:07:55,949
Second--
- [Gary] Way to come through, bro!

1882
01:07:55,949 --> 01:07:58,021
- Yeah. (laughs)

1883
01:07:58,021 --> 01:08:00,277
Second question is, 
my partner and I

1884
01:08:00,277 --> 01:08:02,532
are here from 
Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

1885
01:08:02,532 --> 01:08:03,162
- [Gary] Love it.

1886
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:05,571
- We operate a real
estate brokerage there,

1887
01:08:05,571 --> 01:08:07,878
we're realtors, obviously,
(audience cheers)

1888
01:08:07,878 --> 01:08:09,463
I'm very interested (Gary
chuckles) in Snapchat,

1889
01:08:09,463 --> 01:08:11,048
been on the platform for about

1890
01:08:11,048 --> 01:08:13,161
a year or so, just really started

1891
01:08:13,161 --> 01:08:15,935
digging into it within the
last probably couple of months

1892
01:08:15,935 --> 01:08:17,073
since you got on there and told everybody

1893
01:08:17,073 --> 01:08:18,852
to get onto Snapchat. 
(Gary laughs)

1894
01:08:18,852 --> 01:08:19,827
I'm comfortable with video,

1895
01:08:19,827 --> 01:08:21,363
I've been doing video since 2010,

1896
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:23,415
big inspiration for me
getting on to Youtube,

1897
01:08:23,415 --> 01:08:25,529
starting a video blog, that sort of thing.

1898
01:08:25,529 --> 01:08:26,100
- [Gary] Yep.

1899
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:29,149
- I'm curious, what kind of content

1900
01:08:29,149 --> 01:08:30,854
should we be putting out there

1901
01:08:30,854 --> 01:08:32,481
(Gary sighs) in terms of Snapchat

1902
01:08:32,481 --> 01:08:34,343
15, 20 seconds--
- [Gary] Are you only selling,

1903
01:08:34,343 --> 01:08:37,604
are you in renting spaces?

1904
01:08:37,604 --> 01:08:39,149
- [Man] So we do property management,

1905
01:08:39,149 --> 01:08:40,693
we have a mortgage brokerage,

1906
01:08:40,693 --> 01:08:42,807
we also have a 
real estate sales division.

1907
01:08:42,807 --> 01:08:44,992
- So, look you got a
map the demo right now,

1908
01:08:44,992 --> 01:08:48,296
right now Snapchat in Canada
is skewing very young.

1909
01:08:48,296 --> 01:08:52,372
So, one, you're investing,
right, you're investing.

1910
01:08:52,372 --> 01:08:54,627
You know, are you guys
able to do transactions

1911
01:08:54,627 --> 01:08:56,772
with the 20 to 35-year-old demo a lot?

1912
01:08:56,772 --> 01:08:57,970
- Sure, yeah, probably pushing

1913
01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:00,084
more towards the
35-year-old demo, for sure.

1914
01:09:00,084 --> 01:09:01,354
- So you're probably, my intuition

1915
01:09:01,354 --> 01:09:03,488
is you're 24 to 30 months away,

1916
01:09:03,488 --> 01:09:04,747
which is a long time,

1917
01:09:04,747 --> 01:09:06,555
from like it getting really good.

1918
01:09:06,555 --> 01:09:07,930
- [Man] Yeah, but I love what you say

1919
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:10,185
about investing into the platform.

1920
01:09:10,185 --> 01:09:11,220
- But you gotta be practical

1921
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:12,460
with your investment, right?
- [Man] Sure.

1922
01:09:12,461 --> 01:09:15,004
- [Gary] And so, I would tell you,

1923
01:09:15,004 --> 01:09:17,319
are you hardcore Facebook?

1924
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,698
- Hard work, we run a lot
of Facebook advertising.

1925
01:09:19,698 --> 01:09:20,714
- [Gary] How's it going?

1926
01:09:20,714 --> 01:09:21,810
- Really well, actually.

1927
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:22,399
Really well.

1928
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:23,944
- [Gary] It probably can go better.

1929
01:09:23,944 --> 01:09:26,641
- Okay.
- So I would tell you, take 50%

1930
01:09:26,645 --> 01:09:28,881
of what you were 
gonna do with Snapchat,

1931
01:09:28,881 --> 01:09:31,395
and deploy that to 
be better at Facebook.

1932
01:09:31,395 --> 01:09:32,732
But still do Snapchat.

1933
01:09:32,732 --> 01:09:33,951
- [Man] We're also on Instagram, as well,

1934
01:09:33,951 --> 01:09:35,313
we just started diving into it

1935
01:09:35,313 --> 01:09:37,907
about three weeks ago,

1936
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:39,162
four weeks ago we've, we grown--

1937
01:09:39,162 --> 01:09:40,885
- [Gary] So, seems like you
been around for a little while,

1938
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:42,828
you remember my favorite concept
around real estate, right,

1939
01:09:42,828 --> 01:09:45,564
which is own the story around the town?
- Right.

1940
01:09:45,564 --> 01:09:47,622
- [Gary] Quadruple down on that.
- Okay.

1941
01:09:47,622 --> 01:09:49,371
- Most of you guys, like you,

1942
01:09:49,372 --> 01:09:51,992
2010 Crush It! blueprint, do this,

1943
01:09:51,992 --> 01:09:54,272
most of you have 
not gone far enough

1944
01:09:54,272 --> 01:09:57,686
at owning the 
review of every business

1945
01:09:57,686 --> 01:10:00,551
and park and store in your area,

1946
01:10:00,551 --> 01:10:02,196
and the three to five I can think of

1947
01:10:02,196 --> 01:10:04,309
that have, have destroyed it.

1948
01:10:04,309 --> 01:10:05,000
- [Man] Right.

1949
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,300
- So.

1950
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,493
- [Man] Okay, last question.
- Yeah.

1951
01:10:07,493 --> 01:10:09,237
- [Man] Can I get a snap?
- Yeah.

1952
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:11,523
- [Man] Chat selfie?
- Yes!

1953
01:10:11,523 --> 01:10:12,501
- [Man] With you?
- Yes!

1954
01:10:12,501 --> 01:10:13,647
- [Man] Cool.

1955
01:10:13,647 --> 01:10:14,444
- Cool.

1956
01:10:14,444 --> 01:10:15,256
(audience applauds)

1957
01:10:15,256 --> 01:10:16,435
Let's go to two.

1958
01:10:16,435 --> 01:10:19,096
Oh my god, three's beard is amazing!

1959
01:10:19,096 --> 01:10:22,022
I'm gonna save it, I'm gonna save it.

1960
01:10:22,022 --> 01:10:22,774
- Thanks, brother.

1961
01:10:22,774 --> 01:10:23,630
(man from audience shouts unintelligibly)

1962
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:24,767
(laughter)

1963
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,905
- Now, now,

1964
01:10:25,905 --> 01:10:27,470
how many people here on Snapchat?

1965
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:28,282
(audience cheers)

1966
01:10:28,282 --> 01:10:29,725
So, please take a picture,

1967
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:31,066
I'm gonna do a contest with you guys,

1968
01:10:31,066 --> 01:10:32,955
there's a filter, did you see this?

1969
01:10:32,955 --> 01:10:33,971
- Oh, cool!
- [Gary] I made a custom

1970
01:10:33,971 --> 01:10:37,446
Geo-filter, for this talk only,

1971
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:38,586
there it is.
- Awesome!

1972
01:10:38,586 --> 01:10:40,034
- How sick is that?
- Thank you, brother!

1973
01:10:40,034 --> 01:10:41,714
- You got it, bro! (loud snap)
(audience cheers)

1974
01:10:41,726 --> 01:10:43,557
Weird high-fives are weird.

1975
01:10:43,557 --> 01:10:47,174
(laughter)

1976
01:10:47,174 --> 01:10:47,844
Hello.

1977
01:10:47,844 --> 01:10:50,018
- Hi, I'm Frances.

1978
01:10:50,018 --> 01:10:50,790
- [Gary] How are you?

1979
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:51,705
- I'm fine.

1980
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:53,107
- [Gary] Good!

1981
01:10:53,107 --> 01:10:56,398
- How would you recommend using Periscope?

1982
01:10:56,398 --> 01:10:58,345
- Well, very carefully, for most people,

1983
01:10:58,345 --> 01:11:01,047
'cause live video is really hard.

1984
01:11:01,047 --> 01:11:02,368
And so, I would tell you that,

1985
01:11:02,368 --> 01:11:04,948
as I've been auditing
the live video space,

1986
01:11:04,948 --> 01:11:06,950
it's been, I would really,

1987
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:09,429
one guy's point of view
is subjective, clearly,

1988
01:11:09,429 --> 01:11:13,594
but I think 95 to 97% of
the content is disastrous.

1989
01:11:13,594 --> 01:11:14,956
It's super hard.

1990
01:11:14,956 --> 01:11:17,396
So, first and foremost, I would say,

1991
01:11:17,396 --> 01:11:19,121
do you feel like you can bring value

1992
01:11:19,121 --> 01:11:21,030
to the other person on the other end,

1993
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:22,554
instead of just checking the box

1994
01:11:22,554 --> 01:11:23,997
that you're doing live video?

1995
01:11:23,997 --> 01:11:25,308
Is the first religious thing

1996
01:11:25,308 --> 01:11:27,401
that everybody has to decide.

1997
01:11:27,401 --> 01:11:29,453
After that, I would replicate

1998
01:11:29,453 --> 01:11:32,581
what's doing well in
live video on television.

1999
01:11:32,581 --> 01:11:35,141
So, I mean, I'm telling you right now,

2000
01:11:35,141 --> 01:11:37,091
I think, this is random,

2001
01:11:37,091 --> 01:11:39,225
if you like love, like skateboarding

2002
01:11:39,225 --> 01:11:42,801
or like basketball, or like hockey

2003
01:11:42,801 --> 01:11:44,710
or street hockey, I think somebody

2004
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:47,413
can build a fairly big business

2005
01:11:47,413 --> 01:11:48,806
where they can make like a 100,000 a year

2006
01:11:48,806 --> 01:11:50,788
in a sponsor pretty fast,

2007
01:11:50,788 --> 01:11:53,389
if they're the livestream of like

2008
01:11:53,389 --> 01:11:57,452
the games that are going
on in their neighborhood.

2009
01:11:57,452 --> 01:11:59,931
So, think about sports, think about QVC,

2010
01:11:59,931 --> 01:12:01,353
I'm stunned.

2011
01:12:01,353 --> 01:12:02,816
I would tell you my biggest regret

2012
01:12:02,816 --> 01:12:04,462
is that I'm not still
doing Wine Library TV,

2013
01:12:04,462 --> 01:12:06,555
'cause I would be crushing

2014
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:09,866
24-hour QVC Wine Library TV right now,

2015
01:12:09,866 --> 01:12:12,173
I'd be selling a crapload of wine.

2016
01:12:12,173 --> 01:12:14,652
So, replicate what did well on live

2017
01:12:14,652 --> 01:12:17,360
and television, variety shows,

2018
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:21,786
sports, that, or telemarketing,

2019
01:12:23,223 --> 01:12:26,006
telethons, and just information.

2020
01:12:26,006 --> 01:12:29,257
But, too many people just wanna be live,

2021
01:12:29,257 --> 01:12:30,578
and say they're doing it,

2022
01:12:30,578 --> 01:12:32,305
and not realizing that almost

2023
01:12:32,305 --> 01:12:34,255
all their content is
just in their personal

2024
01:12:34,255 --> 01:12:36,196
best vested in interest.

2025
01:12:36,196 --> 01:12:37,665
I mean, you go look 
at some of the people

2026
01:12:37,665 --> 01:12:39,853
right now that 
are Periscope experts,

2027
01:12:39,853 --> 01:12:41,804
they go on Periscope, 
and they're trying

2028
01:12:41,804 --> 01:12:44,018
to sell you the Periscope class.

2029
01:12:44,018 --> 01:12:46,477
Guys, can we just once and for all

2030
01:12:46,477 --> 01:12:49,159
have a real discussion that we have

2031
01:12:49,159 --> 01:12:52,145
to become dramatically more cynical

2032
01:12:52,145 --> 01:12:54,563
of people that are selling people

2033
01:12:54,563 --> 01:12:56,026
on themselves, when they've never

2034
01:12:56,026 --> 01:12:57,390
built a business in their lives,

2035
01:12:57,390 --> 01:12:58,981
outside of selling people?

2036
01:12:58,981 --> 01:13:00,133
(audience cheers and applauds)

2037
01:13:00,133 --> 01:13:01,860
Just a little bit, just a little bit.

2038
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:03,364
So that's what I would do.

2039
01:13:03,364 --> 01:13:05,355
- So, how would you recommend using

2040
01:13:05,355 --> 01:13:08,077
Periscope in health and wellness?

2041
01:13:08,077 --> 01:13:09,337
- Content, right?

2042
01:13:09,337 --> 01:13:11,105
So if you can teach people,

2043
01:13:11,105 --> 01:13:14,477
if you can create a scheduled class

2044
01:13:14,477 --> 01:13:16,123
where it's always eight
to nine in the morning,

2045
01:13:16,123 --> 01:13:17,302
where you're gonna teach them yoga

2046
01:13:17,302 --> 01:13:20,187
or things of that nature,
and you set it up, something.

2047
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:23,580
If you start with bringing
them value, you will win.

2048
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:24,839
Most people don't wanna give anybody

2049
01:13:24,839 --> 01:13:26,810
the real value, 'cause they want them

2050
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:28,700
to pay them for the real value,

2051
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,325
which by the way, 
with people like that,

2052
01:13:30,325 --> 01:13:33,352
is 97% of the time 
crap to begin with.

2053
01:13:33,352 --> 01:13:36,542
And so, give your best
advice away to the world

2054
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:38,472
in a structured, scheduled way,

2055
01:13:38,472 --> 01:13:41,348
build an audience, you'll
make much more money

2056
01:13:41,348 --> 01:13:43,380
with a yoga pants company,

2057
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:44,863
buying advertising on you,

2058
01:13:44,863 --> 01:13:47,606
than charging everybody for the $29 e-book

2059
01:13:47,606 --> 01:13:51,274
to how to be a yoga
instructor on Periscope.

2060
01:13:52,443 --> 01:13:55,593
Brand over transaction.

2061
01:13:57,659 --> 01:14:01,835
Cool, one, no, I'm
sorry, three, the beard.

2062
01:14:01,835 --> 01:14:03,472
- [Man] Thanks, Gary, 
I'm a huge fan.

2063
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,910
Actually, I need you to sign my book.

2064
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:08,429
I just watched you (Gary laughs)
present at Venture Madness.

2065
01:14:08,429 --> 01:14:09,689
- [Gary] I'm sorry, brother?

2066
01:14:09,689 --> 01:14:12,290
- I just watched you
present at Venture Madness,

2067
01:14:12,290 --> 01:14:13,114
like an hour or two ago.

2068
01:14:13,114 --> 01:14:16,072
- [Gary] Yes, we were there.

2069
01:14:16,072 --> 01:14:18,591
- Due to my beard, I'm
one of the cofounders

2070
01:14:18,591 --> 01:14:20,724
of the Dollar Beard Club,
don't know if you heard of it.

2071
01:14:20,724 --> 01:14:24,348
We spent bunch of money
on Facebook and Instagram,

2072
01:14:24,348 --> 01:14:26,685
I heard a statistic, and
I don't know if it's true

2073
01:14:26,685 --> 01:14:30,484
but they say over 65% of all mobile videos

2074
01:14:30,484 --> 01:14:32,780
they are watched without sound?

2075
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:34,060
- Yes, that is true.

2076
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:36,193
That's why VaynerMedia is got a huge

2077
01:14:36,193 --> 01:14:38,977
transcribing and kind of like,

2078
01:14:38,977 --> 01:14:40,004
what else do they call it?

2079
01:14:40,004 --> 01:14:42,035
Captioning division brewing right now

2080
01:14:42,035 --> 01:14:44,758
for all of our social videos.

2081
01:14:44,758 --> 01:14:46,130
It's crazy.

2082
01:14:46,130 --> 01:14:47,837
There's also a data point that I'm trying

2083
01:14:47,837 --> 01:14:49,665
to confirm of how much people

2084
01:14:49,665 --> 01:14:52,266
are watching like three,
four, five, six, seven, eight

2085
01:14:52,266 --> 01:14:55,986
minute videos, all with captioning and,

2086
01:14:55,986 --> 01:14:57,298
it's unbelievable.

2087
01:14:57,298 --> 01:15:00,386
So the answer is yes,
that is an emerging thing.

2088
01:15:00,386 --> 01:15:01,016
- [Man With Beard] Thank you.

2089
01:15:01,016 --> 01:15:01,910
- You're welcome.

2090
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:03,810
Come in here, I'll sign it real fast.

2091
01:15:03,810 --> 01:15:05,436
This way you won't have
to stand in a huge line.

2092
01:15:05,436 --> 01:15:06,878
You had courage and ask a question.

2093
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:08,971
Two!

2094
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:10,202
And I'll go, I'll just keep going,

2095
01:15:10,202 --> 01:15:11,008
I feel like I'm out of bounds.

2096
01:15:11,008 --> 01:15:12,562
- [Voiceover] How's it going, Gary?

2097
01:15:12,562 --> 01:15:15,429
- So well it would blow your face off.

2098
01:15:15,429 --> 01:15:17,389
- Good.
(laughter)

2099
01:15:17,389 --> 01:15:19,748
So, just throwin' it back to

2100
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:21,851
our homie's virtual reality question.

2101
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:22,400
- [Gary] Yes.

2102
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,391
- Do you see virtual reality going towards

2103
01:15:24,391 --> 01:15:27,926
more gaming or reliving an experience

2104
01:15:27,926 --> 01:15:30,527
or being able to live an
experience with someone else,

2105
01:15:30,527 --> 01:15:33,331
like a family member, while
they're on a trip or something?

2106
01:15:33,331 --> 01:15:34,631
- Oh, you get a pen?

2107
01:15:34,631 --> 01:15:36,358
Yes!

2108
01:15:36,358 --> 01:15:38,146
- [Man] To both?

2109
01:15:38,146 --> 01:15:38,929
- All of 'em. (laughter)

2110
01:15:38,929 --> 01:15:40,128
- [Man] Perfect.
- Right?

2111
01:15:40,128 --> 01:15:42,444
Entertainment, porn's gonna be first,

2112
01:15:42,444 --> 01:15:44,191
'cause they're always fast, right?

2113
01:15:44,191 --> 01:15:46,284
So, porn will be huge, 
I'm super pumped.

2114
01:15:46,284 --> 01:15:48,235
(laughter)

2115
01:15:48,235 --> 01:15:49,912
(loud clapping)

2116
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:50,847
I mean.

2117
01:15:50,847 --> 01:15:52,994
Is that my timer or was
that, I said something weird?

2118
01:15:52,994 --> 01:15:54,152
(laughter)

2119
01:15:54,152 --> 01:15:56,023
I hope it's my timer.

2120
01:15:56,023 --> 01:15:58,421
But porn, movies, video games,

2121
01:15:58,421 --> 01:16:01,407
like imagine Madden 2026 and you really

2122
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:03,715
feel like you're the
quarterback, and it's cool.

2123
01:16:03,715 --> 01:16:05,462
So, but everything,

2124
01:16:05,462 --> 01:16:08,697
there's companies
already now that are filming

2125
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:10,587
people's lives, so they can relive them,

2126
01:16:10,587 --> 01:16:12,366
so you can literally
relive holding your baby

2127
01:16:12,366 --> 01:16:15,434
for the first time, and feel it, 98.6%.

2128
01:16:15,434 --> 01:16:16,775
Like there's gonna be, guys,

2129
01:16:16,775 --> 01:16:18,055
tourism's vulnerable.

2130
01:16:18,055 --> 01:16:19,662
Like, what if you really
felt like right now,

2131
01:16:19,662 --> 01:16:20,475
you put on your contacts

2132
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:22,405
and you feel like you're
at the Eiffel Tower?

2133
01:16:22,405 --> 01:16:24,274
Like you really felt it?

2134
01:16:24,274 --> 01:16:26,489
So, the whole world will be disrupted,

2135
01:16:26,489 --> 01:16:27,566
just like the whole world

2136
01:16:27,566 --> 01:16:29,475
was disrupted when the railroad came.

2137
01:16:29,475 --> 01:16:32,340
Guys, history, history,

2138
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:34,595
like Detroit and Pittsburgh and the ports,

2139
01:16:34,595 --> 01:16:37,562
when the innovation of a, you know, boats?

2140
01:16:37,562 --> 01:16:39,350
That was the innvovation!

2141
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:41,828
Holy crap, there's this
thing that can do this?

2142
01:16:41,828 --> 01:16:43,921
And the ports became rich!

2143
01:16:43,921 --> 01:16:47,680
And then railroads, oh
crap, that's different!

2144
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:50,809
Like, and then suburbs, boxed stores

2145
01:16:50,809 --> 01:16:52,597
and Walmart made their bank, right?

2146
01:16:52,597 --> 01:16:54,689
And then the Internet, Amazon,

2147
01:16:54,689 --> 01:16:58,286
like, guys, the world will always do this

2148
01:16:58,286 --> 01:16:59,617
and you will always sit here and be like,

2149
01:16:59,617 --> 01:17:00,714
"No, it's gonna be exactly like this

2150
01:17:00,714 --> 01:17:01,852
"for the rest of time 'cause I'm happy

2151
01:17:01,852 --> 01:17:05,266
"with the way it is." 
(laughter)

2152
01:17:05,266 --> 01:17:07,135
So, yeah, I think all of those things.

2153
01:17:07,135 --> 01:17:08,943
- [Man] Awesome.
- And to answer it more

2154
01:17:08,943 --> 01:17:11,137
interestingly for you, without hyperbole,

2155
01:17:11,137 --> 01:17:12,722
it will be the talented entrepreneurs

2156
01:17:12,722 --> 01:17:14,855
that decide which 
genres they go into

2157
01:17:14,855 --> 01:17:16,217
that will disrupt it.

2158
01:17:16,217 --> 01:17:18,391
Taxi cabs didn't have 
to be the next thing

2159
01:17:18,391 --> 01:17:20,179
that went, it was just 
that Garrett Camp

2160
01:17:20,179 --> 01:17:22,414
and Travis Kalanick 
decided it was.

2161
01:17:22,414 --> 01:17:23,612
Got it?

2162
01:17:23,612 --> 01:17:25,637
So, I don't know if it's gonna
be entertainment or sports

2163
01:17:25,637 --> 01:17:26,938
or reliving things, it's gonna

2164
01:17:26,938 --> 01:17:29,295
be the best entrepreneurs producing

2165
01:17:29,295 --> 01:17:31,724
for that platform first, you know?

2166
01:17:31,724 --> 01:17:34,080
Jeff Bezos decided
bookstores were in trouble,

2167
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,681
he could've decided wine stores
were in trouble, you know?

2168
01:17:36,681 --> 01:17:37,759
- [Man] Yeah.
- Got it?

2169
01:17:37,759 --> 01:17:39,056
- [Man] Thanks.
- Yeah.

2170
01:17:39,056 --> 01:17:40,866
Four, I know I'm off the time,

2171
01:17:40,866 --> 01:17:42,424
but I'm eating to my own book signing

2172
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:43,887
so I'm gonna go a little further.

2173
01:17:43,887 --> 01:17:45,066
- [Kassem] Gary, my name is Kassem.

2174
01:17:45,066 --> 01:17:47,047
I appreciate you being here.

2175
01:17:47,047 --> 01:17:48,429
I think my question's
gonna get me yelled at

2176
01:17:48,429 --> 01:17:49,231
a little bit, I don't want you to--

2177
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:50,197
- [Gary] Do you want that,

2178
01:17:50,197 --> 01:17:51,395
are into that weird crap?
- [Kassem] No.

2179
01:17:51,395 --> 01:17:52,675
I'm a glutton for punishment,

2180
01:17:52,675 --> 01:17:54,869
actually.
- [Gary] Okay, good.

2181
01:17:54,869 --> 01:17:56,060
- [Kassem] I know what 
you're saying as far as

2182
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:58,904
high integrity marketing,
principle center, provide value,

2183
01:17:58,904 --> 01:18:00,102
and I know you're kinda saying

2184
01:18:00,102 --> 01:18:04,084
stop putting things in a box,

2185
01:18:04,084 --> 01:18:05,343
and I'm gonna just--

2186
01:18:05,343 --> 01:18:07,111
- And by the way, I'm saying,

2187
01:18:07,111 --> 01:18:09,450
if you're 100% in that,

2188
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:11,838
you should start debating
shifting some of it.

2189
01:18:11,838 --> 01:18:14,540
I'm not saying, hey give up your 15,

2190
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:17,060
$150,000 a year arbitrage that's going

2191
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,523
into your pocket and
you're sitting at home

2192
01:18:18,523 --> 01:18:20,412
and it's great and like, and then

2193
01:18:20,412 --> 01:18:23,114
just go become Mother
Teresa and close that down,

2194
01:18:23,114 --> 01:18:26,182
but I'm saying pay attention.

2195
01:18:26,182 --> 01:18:28,834
- [Kassem] Absolutely.
- Okay.

2196
01:18:28,834 --> 01:18:30,674
- [Kassem] Just, from a
philosophical perspective,

2197
01:18:30,674 --> 01:18:31,590
I love everything you're saying,

2198
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:33,582
from a practical 
application perspective,

2199
01:18:33,582 --> 01:18:35,388
like, if you were to write Gary's,

2200
01:18:35,388 --> 01:18:36,912
the 10 things that you need to do

2201
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:39,452
on a day-to-day basis 
to market like Gary,

2202
01:18:39,452 --> 01:18:41,423
'cause I hear the high level,

2203
01:18:41,423 --> 01:18:44,003
thought leadership 
and building a brand,

2204
01:18:44,003 --> 01:18:45,356
but what's the, I mean,

2205
01:18:45,356 --> 01:18:47,196
walk me through the day-to-day.

2206
01:18:47,196 --> 01:18:47,948
Is that annoying?

2207
01:18:47,948 --> 01:18:49,594
- No, it's not annoying,
it's a great question.

2208
01:18:49,594 --> 01:18:52,032
I mean, I'm in a different
part of my career,

2209
01:18:52,032 --> 01:18:53,251
like, let's start with,

2210
01:18:53,251 --> 01:18:54,836
let's start with the 
fact that because

2211
01:18:54,836 --> 01:18:57,436
I thought the social media
was gonna be important,

2212
01:18:57,436 --> 01:19:00,057
after running Wine Library from
three to 50 million dollars

2213
01:19:00,057 --> 01:19:01,775
in revenue in a heartbeat
(snaps fingers loudly),

2214
01:19:01,775 --> 01:19:04,904
I started, after eight
years, 96 straight months

2215
01:19:04,904 --> 01:19:08,094
of doubling revenue, 20%
revenue growth minimum,

2216
01:19:08,094 --> 01:19:10,248
every month that I operated the business.

2217
01:19:10,248 --> 01:19:14,128
The first month that I
started doing Twitter, right?

2218
01:19:14,128 --> 01:19:16,505
Our business was flat.

2219
01:19:16,505 --> 01:19:17,928
So I made a decision, on whatever

2220
01:19:17,928 --> 01:19:19,451
was going on in my life at the time,

2221
01:19:19,451 --> 01:19:21,951
that this future thing was so important,

2222
01:19:21,951 --> 01:19:24,104
that I was gonna spend
15 hours a day replying

2223
01:19:24,104 --> 01:19:28,565
to every person on Twitter, 
and built brand. Right?

2224
01:19:28,565 --> 01:19:30,240
So, I can give you that practical,

2225
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,622
'cause that happened, what I did was,

2226
01:19:31,622 --> 01:19:34,156
every day, I lost money,

2227
01:19:34,156 --> 01:19:36,132
to invest in my future.

2228
01:19:36,132 --> 01:19:37,241
And that's really 
what I'm saying here

2229
01:19:37,241 --> 01:19:38,521
to everybody, right?

2230
01:19:38,521 --> 01:19:42,341
And so, if you're making money right now,

2231
01:19:42,341 --> 01:19:44,474
you gotta decide how you're
gonna make your money.

2232
01:19:44,474 --> 01:19:47,379
I didn't know how I
was gonna make my money

2233
01:19:47,379 --> 01:19:48,984
when I decided to build

2234
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:50,752
some notoriety and attention.

2235
01:19:50,752 --> 01:19:53,344
At first, I thought I was gonna
be selling more wine, right?

2236
01:19:53,344 --> 01:19:55,387
Then I realized it was gonna
be investing in these things,

2237
01:19:55,387 --> 01:19:56,891
which made me a lot, a lot of money.

2238
01:19:56,891 --> 01:19:58,863
Then it was, holy crap, 
they wanna pay

2239
01:19:58,863 --> 01:20:00,631
me $1,000,000 
to write a book?

2240
01:20:00,631 --> 01:20:01,647
That's money!

2241
01:20:01,647 --> 01:20:04,697
Then it was, wait, you want
to pay me $80,000 to speak?

2242
01:20:04,697 --> 01:20:05,570
That was money.

2243
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:07,257
Then it was, I'm gonna
build a business again,

2244
01:20:07,257 --> 01:20:09,024
'cause everybody thinks I'm Gary Vee,

2245
01:20:09,024 --> 01:20:10,203
and nobody remembered that I actually

2246
01:20:10,203 --> 01:20:11,280
built a business, and I don't wanna be

2247
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,438
like all those other people,

2248
01:20:12,438 --> 01:20:14,429
so I'm gonna go back and
start another business.

2249
01:20:14,429 --> 01:20:16,582
So I decided to start a
client service business,

2250
01:20:16,582 --> 01:20:18,127
because I realized 
brands were spending

2251
01:20:18,127 --> 01:20:20,768
all their money on TV
and banner retargeting

2252
01:20:20,768 --> 01:20:22,475
and email, and I knew
this social media thing

2253
01:20:22,475 --> 01:20:23,267
was gonna come.

2254
01:20:23,267 --> 01:20:25,096
So that day-to-day was,

2255
01:20:25,096 --> 01:20:26,843
me and my brother 
and his four homies

2256
01:20:26,843 --> 01:20:31,374
out of college, like, cold
email the CMO of Campbells

2257
01:20:31,374 --> 01:20:33,426
and just start hustling

2258
01:20:33,426 --> 01:20:36,737
and got Gillette 
to pay us $80,000

2259
01:20:36,737 --> 01:20:38,180
to do an activation in Las Vegas

2260
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:39,210
with some Facebook stuff

2261
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:42,098
that we didn't understand,
that they didn't understand,

2262
01:20:42,098 --> 01:20:43,927
and then I started hiring people

2263
01:20:43,927 --> 01:20:47,259
and getting more clients and putting

2264
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:49,392
out content to lead to more business.

2265
01:20:49,392 --> 01:20:51,668
Like, I just, I built an agency, right?

2266
01:20:51,668 --> 01:20:54,900
So, it's not about building your brand

2267
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,844
and then an arbitraging it,

2268
01:20:56,844 --> 01:20:58,165
it's about deciding what business

2269
01:20:58,165 --> 01:21:00,585
you want to run and figuring it out.

2270
01:21:00,585 --> 01:21:02,211
For example, I know that everybody

2271
01:21:02,211 --> 01:21:03,673
in this room, listen to this,

2272
01:21:03,673 --> 01:21:05,807
this is a good one, most people

2273
01:21:05,807 --> 01:21:07,737
in this room can make more money

2274
01:21:07,737 --> 01:21:09,687
than they're making by buying things

2275
01:21:09,687 --> 01:21:12,349
on Ebay and relisting them on Amazon.

2276
01:21:12,349 --> 01:21:15,496
(laughter)

2277
01:21:18,862 --> 01:21:22,357
(audience applauds)

2278
01:21:22,357 --> 01:21:25,117
It's a crazy arbitrage right now.

2279
01:21:27,346 --> 01:21:28,951
So, what I mean by that,

2280
01:21:28,951 --> 01:21:30,881
is that was a tactic, right?

2281
01:21:30,881 --> 01:21:32,689
Like, hey, you wanna make $100,000?

2282
01:21:32,689 --> 01:21:34,173
Go find two categories,

2283
01:21:34,173 --> 01:21:35,757
do the math over 40 days,

2284
01:21:35,757 --> 01:21:38,378
100 days, learn, put in work,

2285
01:21:38,378 --> 01:21:40,674
and pick any random category

2286
01:21:40,674 --> 01:21:44,166
and buy it on Ebay and
resell it on Amazon.

2287
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:48,366
(loud lone whistle)

2288
01:21:48,366 --> 01:21:49,946
- [Kassem] Thanks, man.
- Yeah, man.

2289
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:51,425
(laughs)

2290
01:21:51,425 --> 01:21:53,639
One.

2291
01:21:53,639 --> 01:21:54,960
And I think, what we did there,

2292
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,032
which is, thanks brother, you got a pen?

2293
01:21:57,032 --> 01:21:57,784
You're welcome.

2294
01:21:57,784 --> 01:21:59,461
Who do I make it out to?
- [Voiceover] Kyle.

2295
01:21:59,461 --> 01:22:00,144
- You wanna take a picture?

2296
01:22:00,144 --> 01:22:01,696
- [Voiceover] Yeah.
- Get up here.

2297
01:22:01,701 --> 01:22:03,132
I'm cozy. (speaker is
far away from microphone)

2298
01:22:03,132 --> 01:22:03,785
Oh, you're just gonna take a weird

2299
01:22:03,785 --> 01:22:05,385
picture of me doin' it,
that's so weird? (laughter)

2300
01:22:05,385 --> 01:22:06,401
- And it's C-Y-L-E.

2301
01:22:06,401 --> 01:22:07,800
- C-Y?

2302
01:22:10,665 --> 01:22:12,067
Awesome.

2303
01:22:12,067 --> 01:22:12,676
Wish you well, man.

2304
01:22:12,676 --> 01:22:13,225
Good luck to you.
- [Cyle] Thanks, man.

2305
01:22:13,225 --> 01:22:14,485
I think I'm gonna meet you

2306
01:22:14,485 --> 01:22:16,293
at Andy, in Vegas,
- [Gary] Hope so, hope so.

2307
01:22:16,293 --> 01:22:17,490
Good to see you.

2308
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:18,160
One,

2309
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,493
(audience applauds)

2310
01:22:19,493 --> 01:22:20,499
- Hey, Gary, how you doin'?

2311
01:22:20,499 --> 01:22:21,231
- [Gary] Really well.

2312
01:22:21,231 --> 01:22:22,383
- Good.

2313
01:22:22,383 --> 01:22:23,120
I actually--

2314
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:23,913
- [Gary] What's your name?

2315
01:22:23,913 --> 01:22:25,276
- My name is Michael.
- [Gary] Michael.

2316
01:22:25,276 --> 01:22:28,509
- I actually tweeted
about one of the things

2317
01:22:28,509 --> 01:22:30,439
doing at ICON was to be to get you to sign

2318
01:22:30,439 --> 01:22:33,080
my book, or sign a copy of your book

2319
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,961
and you actually favorited it. (laughter)

2320
01:22:34,961 --> 01:22:36,728
So, now I have to do it.

2321
01:22:36,728 --> 01:22:37,318
- [Gary] Let's do it!

2322
01:22:37,318 --> 01:22:38,151
- Alright.

2323
01:22:38,151 --> 01:22:41,239
My quick question is, I follow a lot

2324
01:22:41,239 --> 01:22:42,580
when you're on Periscope.

2325
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:43,149
- [Gary] Okay.

2326
01:22:43,149 --> 01:22:44,205
- And I just wanted you to know

2327
01:22:44,205 --> 01:22:46,269
I'm kind of in the
online seminar business,

2328
01:22:46,269 --> 01:22:48,057
what do you think of Blab?

2329
01:22:48,057 --> 01:22:49,276
Do you think--
- [Gary] I haven't used it yet

2330
01:22:49,276 --> 01:22:52,610
out of like an inside joke
with myself. (laughter)

2331
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:53,361
I'm not even kidding.

2332
01:22:53,361 --> 01:22:55,507
So many people want 
me to do it with them,

2333
01:22:55,507 --> 01:22:57,884
that I'm literally just 
jerking myself off

2334
01:22:57,884 --> 01:23:00,749
and not doing it. 
(laughter)

2335
01:23:00,749 --> 01:23:02,334
That's literally the truth.

2336
01:23:02,334 --> 01:23:04,467
Like, I'm on a random kick of like,

2337
01:23:04,467 --> 01:23:05,828
I think it's funny.

2338
01:23:05,828 --> 01:23:07,993
And I don't wanna do it.

2339
01:23:07,993 --> 01:23:08,846
(laughter)

2340
01:23:08,846 --> 01:23:11,011
But meaning on the flip side,

2341
01:23:11,011 --> 01:23:12,189
back to everything you've heard from me,

2342
01:23:12,189 --> 01:23:14,120
I'm watching it every day.

2343
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,005
Like, I'm watching Blab,
and I'm watching Peach,

2344
01:23:17,005 --> 01:23:20,459
and I'm watching 
everything, everyday.

2345
01:23:20,459 --> 01:23:24,095
Blab isn't at a place
where my little inside joke

2346
01:23:24,095 --> 01:23:25,863
is more valuable for me to go,

2347
01:23:25,863 --> 01:23:28,972
like, the second I decide
Blab's valuable enough,

2348
01:23:28,972 --> 01:23:31,938
I'll get off my little joke.

2349
01:23:31,938 --> 01:23:33,015
- Do you, well, quick follow-up,

2350
01:23:33,015 --> 01:23:36,144
do you think that will kinda replace

2351
01:23:36,144 --> 01:23:38,826
or actually compete with like the,

2352
01:23:38,826 --> 01:23:42,098
all the webinar software that is, like--

2353
01:23:42,098 --> 01:23:42,799
- All that stuff.

2354
01:23:42,799 --> 01:23:44,357
I don't know, I don't know.

2355
01:23:44,357 --> 01:23:47,364
I mean, look, I do think
that online courses

2356
01:23:47,364 --> 01:23:48,989
and that stuff is a big business,

2357
01:23:48,989 --> 01:23:51,691
there's a lot of players,
Chase Jarvis has got his thing,

2358
01:23:51,691 --> 01:23:54,567
Udemy, Skillshare, there's a lot,

2359
01:23:54,567 --> 01:23:56,883
a lot players, everybody wants to do it,

2360
01:23:56,883 --> 01:23:58,062
they all want to do the same thing,

2361
01:23:58,062 --> 01:23:59,687
which is, they wanna build a platform,

2362
01:23:59,687 --> 01:24:01,699
sit in the middle, let you do your thing,

2363
01:24:01,699 --> 01:24:03,263
let me do my thing, take a percentage

2364
01:24:03,263 --> 01:24:05,457
of our action, way too much.

2365
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:07,956
And that's what they're doing.

2366
01:24:07,956 --> 01:24:09,128
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

2367
01:24:09,128 --> 01:24:10,592
I think that's a race to the bottom.

2368
01:24:10,592 --> 01:24:12,116
I think the person that wins it,

2369
01:24:12,116 --> 01:24:14,127
charges people very, very, very little,

2370
01:24:14,127 --> 01:24:15,401
everybody goes there and they win

2371
01:24:15,401 --> 01:24:16,803
because the platform shouldn't

2372
01:24:16,803 --> 01:24:19,241
make as much of the 
vig for the providers

2373
01:24:19,241 --> 01:24:22,509
of the content who have the audience.

2374
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:25,989
Are you gonna come up here
and get your book signed?

2375
01:24:25,989 --> 01:24:27,879
Let's do it.

2376
01:24:27,879 --> 01:24:29,565
Alright, four.

2377
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:30,947
See, I blabbed you!

2378
01:24:30,947 --> 01:24:32,827
You wanted it so bad, I wanted
you to wait a little bit.

2379
01:24:32,827 --> 01:24:35,001
We're coming, though.

2380
01:24:35,001 --> 01:24:35,814
Hi.

2381
01:24:35,814 --> 01:24:37,320
Well, what is this, two for one gig?

2382
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:39,656
(laughter)

2383
01:24:39,656 --> 01:24:40,184
- [Voiceover] Can I?

2384
01:24:40,184 --> 01:24:40,725
- Yes.

2385
01:24:40,725 --> 01:24:41,492
Sure.
- [Woman] For my husband,

2386
01:24:41,492 --> 01:24:42,902
T-E-E-R-R-Y.

2387
01:24:42,902 --> 01:24:43,653
- T-E?

2388
01:24:43,653 --> 01:24:44,985
- T-E-R-R-Y.

2389
01:24:44,985 --> 01:24:46,117
- Mhmmm, Terry.

2390
01:24:46,117 --> 01:24:48,027
- Yes, he's a big fan of you.

2391
01:24:48,027 --> 01:24:49,574
- Well, tell Terry I'm very happy.

2392
01:24:49,574 --> 01:24:50,935
- Yes, can I get a picture with you?

2393
01:24:50,935 --> 01:24:52,195
- Yes.

2394
01:24:52,195 --> 01:24:53,170
With you?

2395
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:54,023
- Yeah!

2396
01:24:54,023 --> 01:24:54,877
- Get on here.

2397
01:24:54,877 --> 01:24:55,425
(laughs)

2398
01:24:55,425 --> 01:24:58,392
Sorry guys, I can listen to the question.

2399
01:24:58,392 --> 01:25:00,179
- Gary, Kerwin Rae from Australia,

2400
01:25:00,179 --> 01:25:00,995
mate, how are you?

2401
01:25:00,995 --> 01:25:01,990
- [Gary] Hey, brother, how are you?

2402
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:02,742
- Good to see you again.

2403
01:25:02,742 --> 01:25:04,591
- [Gary] Yeah, thanks for
having me in Vegas that time.

2404
01:25:04,591 --> 01:25:05,363
- Mate, it was a pleasure.

2405
01:25:05,363 --> 01:25:08,431
It's really changed the 
face of the way

2406
01:25:08,431 --> 01:25:10,259
that we do business--

2407
01:25:10,259 --> 01:25:11,133
- [Gary] Meaning, meaning?

2408
01:25:11,133 --> 01:25:12,245
You're welcome darling.
- [Kerwin] Meaning,

2409
01:25:12,245 --> 01:25:13,108
I'll give you some context.

2410
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,090
Over Christmas, I started to realize

2411
01:25:15,090 --> 01:25:18,536
that we are socially illiterate

2412
01:25:18,536 --> 01:25:20,547
when it comes to promoting

2413
01:25:20,547 --> 01:25:23,567
or cross arrange
different social channels.

2414
01:25:23,567 --> 01:25:26,317
And so I came back from
my little bit of a break

2415
01:25:26,317 --> 01:25:29,826
with a vengeance, and we're now,

2416
01:25:29,826 --> 01:25:31,736
I have a videographer that's
following me basically

2417
01:25:31,736 --> 01:25:34,195
four days a week, we're
constantly filming content,

2418
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:35,962
preparing it to push it out

2419
01:25:35,962 --> 01:25:37,994
across a whole range of channels.

2420
01:25:37,994 --> 01:25:40,687
Snapchat specifically 
and just to give you

2421
01:25:40,687 --> 01:25:43,085
some gratitude for that,

2422
01:25:43,085 --> 01:25:45,365
in the first 10 days 
of being on Snapchat,

2423
01:25:45,365 --> 01:25:48,027
we actually netted about
$11,000 in sales from--

2424
01:25:48,027 --> 01:25:49,794
- [Gary] Let me hear that one more time.

2425
01:25:49,794 --> 01:25:52,639
- In our first 10 days
of being on Snapchat

2426
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:55,463
we netted about $11,000 in
sales. (audience cheers)

2427
01:25:55,463 --> 01:25:57,332
- Let me just help everybody
understand what that is,

2428
01:25:57,332 --> 01:26:01,472
that's called ROI, motherfuckers!

2429
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:05,662
(audience cheers)

2430
01:26:09,862 --> 01:26:12,239
Seriously, guys, guys,

2431
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:15,835
everything you do, and
the market looks for,

2432
01:26:15,835 --> 01:26:17,521
that's called direct mail.

2433
01:26:17,521 --> 01:26:19,736
It's been around forever,
it's transactional,

2434
01:26:19,736 --> 01:26:21,982
you send 40,000 of 'em to the mail,

2435
01:26:21,982 --> 01:26:24,705
you collect 18,000 coupons or 800 coupons,

2436
01:26:24,705 --> 01:26:25,903
you run the quant.

2437
01:26:25,903 --> 01:26:28,342
There's another thing,
it was called television,

2438
01:26:28,342 --> 01:26:30,983
it's how the biggest businesses
in the world were built,

2439
01:26:30,983 --> 01:26:35,635
it wasn't quantifiable, it
was just scale and brand.

2440
01:26:35,635 --> 01:26:38,175
Digital came along 
and everybody decided

2441
01:26:38,175 --> 01:26:40,999
that the better bet was direct mail

2442
01:26:40,999 --> 01:26:42,889
because you could measure it,

2443
01:26:42,889 --> 01:26:45,550
and they wanted to punt television,

2444
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:48,720
'cause you couldn't.

2445
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:49,585
Got it?

2446
01:26:49,585 --> 01:26:50,580
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

2447
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:51,628
- Cool, keep going.

2448
01:26:51,628 --> 01:26:56,098
- So that 11 grand came from
no direct promotion whatsoever,

2449
01:26:56,098 --> 01:26:57,480
just from snapbacks--
- [Gary] Oh, weird,

2450
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,126
when you actually bring value,

2451
01:26:59,126 --> 01:27:00,591
people are like, "Oh, this feels better

2452
01:27:00,591 --> 01:27:03,070
"than the douchery that
everybody else is doing."

2453
01:27:03,070 --> 01:27:03,943
(laughter)

2454
01:27:03,943 --> 01:27:05,223
Weird!

2455
01:27:05,223 --> 01:27:09,145
Crazy, crazy.

2456
01:27:09,145 --> 01:27:10,276
- Which would happen while I just

2457
01:27:10,276 --> 01:27:12,501
leaning how to basically use the tool.

2458
01:27:12,501 --> 01:27:14,432
So, to get to the question,

2459
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:16,443
I'm curious to know 
if you have a specific

2460
01:27:16,443 --> 01:27:18,434
Snapchat content strategy?
- [Gary] Are you wearing

2461
01:27:18,434 --> 01:27:20,274
a Snapchat T-shirt? (laughter)

2462
01:27:20,274 --> 01:27:20,956
- I am.

2463
01:27:20,956 --> 01:27:22,154
- [Gary] Jeez.

2464
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:22,714
Amazing.

2465
01:27:22,714 --> 01:27:23,635
- And I cannot tell you,

2466
01:27:23,635 --> 01:27:25,355
I have literally had probably,

2467
01:27:25,355 --> 01:27:26,940
I'm gonna guess here,

2468
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:29,277
maybe 30 people that
have connected with me

2469
01:27:29,277 --> 01:27:30,353
as a result of just

2470
01:27:30,353 --> 01:27:31,552
wearing this T-shirt.
- [Gary] Sure, they did

2471
01:27:31,552 --> 01:27:32,478
the screen, yeah.

2472
01:27:32,478 --> 01:27:33,657
- Yeah.

2473
01:27:33,657 --> 01:27:34,644
But I'm curious to know if you've got

2474
01:27:34,644 --> 01:27:37,386
a specific content strategy for Snapchat?

2475
01:27:37,386 --> 01:27:39,093
- [Gary] Yes.

2476
01:27:39,093 --> 01:27:40,922
- [Kerwin] Outside of
just providing value,

2477
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:42,263
like is it, like, you try to have

2478
01:27:42,263 --> 01:27:44,701
a frequency there, is
there something specific

2479
01:27:44,701 --> 01:27:46,134
that you're tryin' to go for?

2480
01:27:46,134 --> 01:27:47,333
- No!

2481
01:27:47,333 --> 01:27:50,441
I use it where I know that
something else can't do it.

2482
01:27:50,441 --> 01:27:51,701
So on days I'm doing DailyVee

2483
01:27:51,701 --> 01:27:53,349
and I know DRock's there,

2484
01:27:53,349 --> 01:27:54,823
I don't have to 
document as much,

2485
01:27:54,823 --> 01:27:56,103
because I know that's taken care of it,

2486
01:27:56,103 --> 01:27:58,811
but when I'm traveling like I
am right now, I'll do it more.

2487
01:27:58,811 --> 01:27:59,676
But what it's really there for,

2488
01:27:59,676 --> 01:28:02,349
and I wonder if Anchor's
gonna do this for me as well,

2489
01:28:02,349 --> 01:28:04,076
is it allows me to not lose

2490
01:28:04,076 --> 01:28:05,986
the 80,000 things I wanted to tell

2491
01:28:05,986 --> 01:28:07,684
all of you over the last seven years,

2492
01:28:07,684 --> 01:28:09,451
that I didn't, because I didn't put it

2493
01:28:09,451 --> 01:28:11,849
in Twitter form, I didn't
put it in Youtube form,

2494
01:28:11,849 --> 01:28:15,445
but Snapchat, like, yesterdays'
Snapchat secret rant

2495
01:28:15,445 --> 01:28:16,664
brought a lot of value 
to a lot of people,

2496
01:28:16,664 --> 01:28:18,411
I got hunderds of emails.

2497
01:28:18,411 --> 01:28:19,143
Right?

2498
01:28:19,143 --> 01:28:20,829
And so, that wouldn't have happened

2499
01:28:20,829 --> 01:28:25,482
without Snapchat, I wouldn't
have done that in Twitter form.

2500
01:28:25,482 --> 01:28:27,656
So, I'm using it for when I feel

2501
01:28:27,656 --> 01:28:29,200
that there's no other outlet for it,

2502
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,277
but there's no direct strategy,

2503
01:28:30,277 --> 01:28:31,983
like I'm gonna post seven times a day,

2504
01:28:31,983 --> 01:28:33,243
at these timezones,

2505
01:28:33,243 --> 01:28:35,925
because my users are in China,

2506
01:28:35,925 --> 01:28:37,591
and here in the US like.

2507
01:28:37,591 --> 01:28:39,704
I don't do that, becase that, again,

2508
01:28:39,704 --> 01:28:41,390
is good, and you can do that,

2509
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:42,365
and people should do that

2510
01:28:42,365 --> 01:28:45,485
and it's fine, it's just not what I do.

2511
01:28:45,485 --> 01:28:46,664
- Do you think it's possible, and I know

2512
01:28:46,664 --> 01:28:48,574
I'm gonna--
- [Gary] Yes, I definitely

2513
01:28:48,574 --> 01:28:49,386
think it's possible!

2514
01:28:49,386 --> 01:28:52,515
- Do you think it's
possible to snap too much?

2515
01:28:52,515 --> 01:28:56,111
- If it's good, no, if it's not, yes.

2516
01:28:56,111 --> 01:28:58,753
People will watch a four hour movie

2517
01:28:58,753 --> 01:29:00,805
if it's great, nobody's gone there

2518
01:29:00,805 --> 01:29:02,125
and they're wrong, I might make one

2519
01:29:02,125 --> 01:29:03,832
just to prove it. (laughter)

2520
01:29:03,832 --> 01:29:07,103
And, they will get out
of a six second Vine

2521
01:29:07,103 --> 01:29:09,947
two seconds in, if it sucks.

2522
01:29:09,947 --> 01:29:11,614
People are always trying to look for,

2523
01:29:11,614 --> 01:29:13,952
"Gary, what are the nine
rules of a good snap?"

2524
01:29:13,952 --> 01:29:17,996
Guys, it's value!

2525
01:29:17,996 --> 01:29:19,702
If you're great,

2526
01:29:19,702 --> 01:29:21,876
I can fucking stream 24 hours a day

2527
01:29:21,876 --> 01:29:24,782
and pull it off, 'cause I got
a lot of value. (laughter)

2528
01:29:24,782 --> 01:29:25,371
Really!

2529
01:29:25,371 --> 01:29:26,895
But probably I'd run out, too, right?

2530
01:29:26,895 --> 01:29:28,540
Like, it just comes 
down to how much value

2531
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:32,525
can you bring to the audience.

2532
01:29:32,525 --> 01:29:34,946
- Thank you.
- [Gary] You're welcome.

2533
01:29:34,946 --> 01:29:36,751
Three.

2534
01:29:36,751 --> 01:29:38,336
- [Voiceover] I actually
appreciate it when you swear.

2535
01:29:38,336 --> 01:29:39,413
- Thanks man.

2536
01:29:39,413 --> 01:29:40,388
(laughter)

2537
01:29:40,388 --> 01:29:42,399
- So, my name is Myles Binford,

2538
01:29:42,399 --> 01:29:44,472
I wanna talk to the investor
side of you for a second.

2539
01:29:44,472 --> 01:29:45,975
- [Gary] Okay.

2540
01:29:45,975 --> 01:29:46,808
Oh, please wrap up.

2541
01:29:46,808 --> 01:29:49,127
- You mentioned the market
correction (laughter)

2542
01:29:49,127 --> 01:29:50,002
that's happening in the venture--
- [Gary] Hold on,

2543
01:29:50,002 --> 01:29:51,382
let me take a picture,
this is pretty funny.

2544
01:29:51,382 --> 01:29:53,008
What, go ahead, venture side of me.

2545
01:29:53,008 --> 01:29:54,072
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.

2546
01:29:54,072 --> 01:29:55,982
So, you mentioned the correction

2547
01:29:55,982 --> 01:29:57,781
that's kind of happening
at the venture end,

2548
01:29:57,781 --> 01:29:58,695
so.
- [Gary] Yes!

2549
01:29:58,695 --> 01:30:00,443
- [Myles] Coming up
here, what is your take

2550
01:30:00,443 --> 01:30:02,860
on what's happening 
and the fund raising

2551
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:06,457
side of things and for a
serial startup entrepreneur

2552
01:30:06,457 --> 01:30:09,504
trying to raise funds, do
you think it's gonna be hard

2553
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:11,373
to raise funds as a startup?
- [Gary] Yes!

2554
01:30:11,373 --> 01:30:12,978
- [Myles] Or, later on?

2555
01:30:12,978 --> 01:30:13,954
- [Gary] Yes!

2556
01:30:13,954 --> 01:30:14,543
- Definitely?

2557
01:30:14,543 --> 01:30:17,665
- I think that the market

2558
01:30:17,665 --> 01:30:19,596
is in a place where--

2559
01:30:19,596 --> 01:30:20,828
- Where's the market, Gary? (laughter)

2560
01:30:20,828 --> 01:30:22,656
- The market's at a place where

2561
01:30:22,656 --> 01:30:24,038
every entrepreneur's getting exposed

2562
01:30:24,038 --> 01:30:25,582
'cause money's getting harder

2563
01:30:25,582 --> 01:30:26,517
and so if you're good enough,

2564
01:30:26,517 --> 01:30:27,797
you'll raise money, but if you're not,

2565
01:30:27,797 --> 01:30:29,027
you won't as easily.

2566
01:30:29,027 --> 01:30:29,657
- Fantastic.

2567
01:30:29,657 --> 01:30:30,542
- You're welcome. (laughter)

2568
01:30:30,542 --> 01:30:31,883
- [Myles] Okay.

2569
01:30:31,883 --> 01:30:34,182
- So, (audience cheers),
whether it's a SaaS tech product

2570
01:30:34,182 --> 01:30:37,310
or a product or if it's just you, Johnny,

2571
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:39,586
it doesn't matter what it is,

2572
01:30:39,586 --> 01:30:41,415
their money's drying up because

2573
01:30:41,415 --> 01:30:44,706
the supply and demand is off-kilter.

2574
01:30:44,706 --> 01:30:45,783
- [Myles] Okay.

2575
01:30:45,783 --> 01:30:46,494
- Yeah.

2576
01:30:46,494 --> 01:30:47,977
Awesome, thanks man.

2577
01:30:47,977 --> 01:30:49,463
Two.

2578
01:30:52,962 --> 01:30:54,254
- [Voiceover] Hi, Gary!
- Hi!

2579
01:30:54,254 --> 01:30:55,664
- [Voiceover] My name is Roberta Ross

2580
01:30:55,664 --> 01:30:56,591
and--
- [Gary] Hey, Roberta!

2581
01:30:56,591 --> 01:30:58,802
- [Voiceover] Thank you
very much for your message,

2582
01:30:58,802 --> 01:30:59,748
it's--
- [Gary] Do you love it?

2583
01:30:59,748 --> 01:31:01,231
- [Roberta] It's a gift to
the world, it really is.

2584
01:31:01,231 --> 01:31:01,983
- [Gary] To the world?

2585
01:31:01,983 --> 01:31:05,254
- Yes, to the world. (laughter)

2586
01:31:05,254 --> 01:31:06,554
One audience at a time.

2587
01:31:06,554 --> 01:31:07,266
- [Gary] That's right.

2588
01:31:07,266 --> 01:31:08,200
Go ahead.

2589
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,557
- My only exposure to you before this

2590
01:31:10,557 --> 01:31:13,483
was an interview you did of Seth Godin,

2591
01:31:13,483 --> 01:31:15,372
so I hadn't heard your story--

2592
01:31:15,372 --> 01:31:16,287
- [Gary] And did you feel like

2593
01:31:16,287 --> 01:31:17,445
I was into--
- [Roberta] A quarter Russian,

2594
01:31:17,445 --> 01:31:18,745
so we have that--
- [Gary] Was that on my show

2595
01:31:18,745 --> 01:31:19,867
or something--
- [Roberta] It was on yours,

2596
01:31:19,867 --> 01:31:20,984
yes.
- [Gary] And did you feel

2597
01:31:20,984 --> 01:31:22,085
like I was--
- But he promoted it.

2598
01:31:22,085 --> 01:31:23,956
- And I was interrupting
him too much? (laughter)

2599
01:31:23,956 --> 01:31:25,308
- [Roberta] You were
interrupting him a lot,

2600
01:31:25,308 --> 01:31:26,385
yeah.
- [Gary] Yes.

2601
01:31:26,385 --> 01:31:27,248
- [Roberta] But in a good way. (laughs)

2602
01:31:27,248 --> 01:31:28,569
- Oh, good, thank you!

2603
01:31:28,569 --> 01:31:30,438
Thank you for figuring me out,

2604
01:31:30,438 --> 01:31:31,738
even some of my own fans didn't,

2605
01:31:31,738 --> 01:31:32,598
I'm very mad at you.

2606
01:31:32,598 --> 01:31:33,242
Okay, go ahead.

2607
01:31:33,242 --> 01:31:36,899
- So, I feel like your message

2608
01:31:36,899 --> 01:31:39,479
is something that I've on the path of,

2609
01:31:39,479 --> 01:31:41,612
I've been an entrepreneur
for over 20 years,

2610
01:31:41,612 --> 01:31:43,543
I've been a business coach,

2611
01:31:43,543 --> 01:31:46,224
and I've been taking
people on this journey,

2612
01:31:46,224 --> 01:31:48,175
helping them recognize their value,

2613
01:31:48,175 --> 01:31:50,735
make more money and be happy.

2614
01:31:50,735 --> 01:31:54,981
And so, the big hook for people

2615
01:31:54,981 --> 01:31:56,911
that I feel like to get their attention

2616
01:31:56,911 --> 01:32:01,280
is I, my brand is Six
Figure Real Estate Coach,

2617
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,027
that's the name of my company,

2618
01:32:03,027 --> 01:32:05,099
and I coach a lot of real estate agents

2619
01:32:05,099 --> 01:32:07,416
and solopreneurs.

2620
01:32:07,416 --> 01:32:09,366
And so, I know that they wanna make

2621
01:32:09,366 --> 01:32:11,063
more money, so I do that for them

2622
01:32:11,063 --> 01:32:12,323
to get that attention

2623
01:32:12,323 --> 01:32:13,695
and it's not--
- [Gary] And then you trick 'em!

2624
01:32:13,705 --> 01:32:14,924
- It's not a bait-and-switch,

2625
01:32:14,924 --> 01:32:16,001
it's not a bait-and-switch!
- [Gary] But it is!

2626
01:32:16,001 --> 01:32:16,935
I love, I do it, too!

2627
01:32:16,935 --> 01:32:18,919
- It's a bait-and-add.
- [Gary] My entire personality

2628
01:32:18,919 --> 01:32:20,108
is a bait-and-switch.

2629
01:32:20,108 --> 01:32:20,810
- Okay. (laughter)

2630
01:32:20,810 --> 01:32:23,585
Maybe, then maybe 
this might be moot,

2631
01:32:23,585 --> 01:32:25,332
but I was interested 
in your opinion,

2632
01:32:25,332 --> 01:32:26,328
because I struggled

2633
01:32:26,328 --> 01:32:27,892
a little bit with the brand.
- [Gary] Because the name

2634
01:32:27,892 --> 01:32:31,459
is so, yeah, like, 'cause
I think you're a spambot.

2635
01:32:31,459 --> 01:32:32,475
- That I'm a spambot?

2636
01:32:32,475 --> 01:32:33,572
- Yes.

2637
01:32:33,572 --> 01:32:35,279
Because anybody's 
brand that's six figure

2638
01:32:35,279 --> 01:32:38,012
or seven figure this, 
I think is crap.

2639
01:32:38,012 --> 01:32:40,808
But, but!
- [Roberta] Okay.

2640
01:32:40,808 --> 01:32:42,027
- [Gary] 40% of people hate me

2641
01:32:42,027 --> 01:32:43,632
the first time they
ever consume me,

2642
01:32:43,632 --> 01:32:45,167
so I'm hearing you and saying,

2643
01:32:45,167 --> 01:32:46,681
ooh, I like that, 
I see what she's doing,

2644
01:32:46,681 --> 01:32:48,399
that's what I do.

2645
01:32:48,399 --> 01:32:51,723
- So, great, because
when I first heard you

2646
01:32:51,723 --> 01:32:52,597
I was like,

2647
01:32:52,597 --> 01:32:54,694
not it, not it.
- [Gary] Yeah, he's a jerk.

2648
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:56,333
- [Roberta] And then I
listened more, because

2649
01:32:56,333 --> 01:32:57,213
Seth was next to you--
- [Gary] Think about how great

2650
01:32:57,213 --> 01:32:58,867
this is, we both felt the same way

2651
01:32:58,867 --> 01:32:59,511
about each other.

2652
01:32:59,511 --> 01:33:01,179
- Isn't that so interesting?

2653
01:33:01,179 --> 01:33:02,642
(laughter)

2654
01:33:02,642 --> 01:33:05,364
See, we just gotta not prejudge, right?

2655
01:33:05,364 --> 01:33:07,865
We have a deeper bond.
- [Gary] Yes.

2656
01:33:07,865 --> 01:33:09,441
- [Roberta] So, maybe then I don't need

2657
01:33:09,441 --> 01:33:10,387
to do anything.

2658
01:33:10,387 --> 01:33:12,784
So, there's a part of 
me that even though

2659
01:33:12,784 --> 01:33:16,372
I'm letting go that
transactional approach.

2660
01:33:16,372 --> 01:33:16,940
- [Gary] Yes.

2661
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:18,566
- And I'm just putting stuff out there,

2662
01:33:18,566 --> 01:33:20,955
I just wanna lift people up, I want them

2663
01:33:20,955 --> 01:33:22,336
to recognize their value--
- [Gary] You're talking about

2664
01:33:22,336 --> 01:33:23,749
your actual, so you're saying,

2665
01:33:23,749 --> 01:33:25,314
"Now I'm giving good advice,

2666
01:33:25,314 --> 01:33:26,300
"some people used to come in

2667
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:28,007
"and have to pay for some of that,

2668
01:33:28,007 --> 01:33:29,409
"but now I'm putting it out there."

2669
01:33:29,409 --> 01:33:30,114
- [Roberta] Well, as a coach,

2670
01:33:30,114 --> 01:33:31,536
they have to pay for it, if they want

2671
01:33:31,536 --> 01:33:32,427
one-on-one attention.

2672
01:33:32,427 --> 01:33:33,254
- [Gary] Of course, 
that's right, yep.

2673
01:33:33,254 --> 01:33:35,331
- But yes, so I'm just
putting it out there,

2674
01:33:35,331 --> 01:33:36,022
even--
- [Gary] You should!

2675
01:33:36,022 --> 01:33:37,090
- [Roberta] Like, I have people posting

2676
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:38,706
things and I don't ask for anything,

2677
01:33:38,706 --> 01:33:41,226
they even say, 
"Go like my Facebook page,"

2678
01:33:41,226 --> 01:33:43,136
I'm like, don't even put that on!

2679
01:33:43,136 --> 01:33:45,818
So, my question is,

2680
01:33:45,818 --> 01:33:48,357
I have a hard time letting go

2681
01:33:48,357 --> 01:33:50,003
of the brand, because I know

2682
01:33:50,003 --> 01:33:51,120
that it gets--
- [Gary] It's your identity?

2683
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:52,741
- [Roberta] Attention, it's not really

2684
01:33:52,741 --> 01:33:54,459
mine, I mean,

2685
01:33:54,459 --> 01:33:57,672
I invested six years into it.
- [Gary] Well it is, yeah.

2686
01:33:57,672 --> 01:34:01,474
- [Roberta] But it's still (mumbles),

2687
01:34:01,474 --> 01:34:03,221
like I'm afraid to let it go,

2688
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:05,845
because I wanna make sure--
- [Gary] Because it's working!

2689
01:34:05,845 --> 01:34:06,475
- [Roberta] Yes!

2690
01:34:06,475 --> 01:34:08,315
- 'Cause you're bottom feeding.

2691
01:34:08,315 --> 01:34:09,534
(Roberta laughs)

2692
01:34:09,534 --> 01:34:10,692
- Well actually I feel

2693
01:34:10,692 --> 01:34:12,968
like because I'm 
speaking from the heart

2694
01:34:12,968 --> 01:34:14,681
and I want other people, too--
- [Gary] No, because you're

2695
01:34:14,681 --> 01:34:19,146
speaking to a vanity
that many people want.

2696
01:34:19,146 --> 01:34:20,308
That's what you're speaking to, darling.

2697
01:34:20,308 --> 01:34:21,377
- I'm referring not to the brand,

2698
01:34:21,377 --> 01:34:23,177
I'm referring to the message.

2699
01:34:23,177 --> 01:34:24,256
- [Gary] No, no, so--
- The message

2700
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,028
when I'm a speaker--
- [Gary] Got it!

2701
01:34:25,028 --> 01:34:26,181
- [Roberta] And when I speak.

2702
01:34:26,181 --> 01:34:27,928
- You're saying that, "I don't feel great

2703
01:34:27,928 --> 01:34:30,093
"about myself in how I
get them in the door,

2704
01:34:30,093 --> 01:34:31,190
"but once I get them in the door,

2705
01:34:31,190 --> 01:34:32,829
"I feel great."

2706
01:34:32,829 --> 01:34:34,292
- [Roberta] Okay, yeah,
that's probably true.

2707
01:34:34,292 --> 01:34:35,552
- It is true, that's what you're saying.

2708
01:34:35,552 --> 01:34:36,591
Everybody knows this, 
(Roberta laughs)

2709
01:34:36,591 --> 01:34:37,891
so let's get it grounded.

2710
01:34:37,891 --> 01:34:38,796
Okay.

2711
01:34:38,796 --> 01:34:40,381
Now the question becomes.

2712
01:34:40,381 --> 01:34:43,165
- So the question is,

2713
01:34:43,165 --> 01:34:45,365
my, I feel--
- [Gary] Are you hoping,

2714
01:34:45,365 --> 01:34:46,901
let me ask you a question,
are you hoping

2715
01:34:46,901 --> 01:34:49,928
that by putting out good
content, that that might become

2716
01:34:49,928 --> 01:34:53,789
the gateway drug, instead of the brand?

2717
01:34:53,789 --> 01:34:56,166
- I feel like the shift in me

2718
01:34:56,166 --> 01:34:58,360
and what I'm putting out is attracting

2719
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:00,656
the people that I want to work with,

2720
01:35:00,656 --> 01:35:02,017
more and more and more--
- [Gary] Instead of,

2721
01:35:02,017 --> 01:35:05,355
because you were getting a
different kind of person before.

2722
01:35:05,355 --> 01:35:06,403
- More of a range.

2723
01:35:06,403 --> 01:35:07,312
But now it's narrowing.
- [Gary] No, no, not more

2724
01:35:07,312 --> 01:35:08,419
range, you were getting people

2725
01:35:08,419 --> 01:35:10,959
that were attracted to Six
Figure Real Estate Coach

2726
01:35:10,959 --> 01:35:12,645
because people that are attracted

2727
01:35:12,645 --> 01:35:15,571
to the brand Six Figure 
Real Estate Coach

2728
01:35:15,571 --> 01:35:16,587
are the people that don't want

2729
01:35:16,587 --> 01:35:19,878
to do anything that is real,

2730
01:35:19,878 --> 01:35:24,542
and they want shortcuts
to get to six figures.

2731
01:35:24,542 --> 01:35:28,204
- So, that's my, so my question is,

2732
01:35:28,204 --> 01:35:29,646
I guess I have your opinion,

2733
01:35:29,646 --> 01:35:31,515
but should I change it,

2734
01:35:31,515 --> 01:35:32,612
even though--
- [Gary] That's not,

2735
01:35:32,612 --> 01:35:34,868
that's not my thing to say.

2736
01:35:34,868 --> 01:35:36,838
We all know that 
you wanna change it.

2737
01:35:36,838 --> 01:35:39,012
My thing is, you should change it

2738
01:35:39,012 --> 01:35:40,313
for a couple of months,

2739
01:35:40,313 --> 01:35:43,703
you can always go back to it.

2740
01:35:45,505 --> 01:35:47,293
How you make your money

2741
01:35:47,293 --> 01:35:50,585
matters more than how much you make.

2742
01:35:50,585 --> 01:35:52,315
To me, and by the way,

2743
01:35:52,315 --> 01:35:53,614
and by the way.
- [Roberta] Yes, I like that.

2744
01:35:53,614 --> 01:35:55,771
- [Gary] It does not have to to you,

2745
01:35:55,771 --> 01:35:58,047
I have no interest in judging you,

2746
01:35:58,047 --> 01:36:00,952
you have to judge you.

2747
01:36:00,952 --> 01:36:02,496
But I know anybody who ever asks

2748
01:36:02,496 --> 01:36:05,162
me that question wants to be on this side

2749
01:36:05,162 --> 01:36:07,701
of the equation. Because there's plenty

2750
01:36:07,701 --> 01:36:09,204
of six figure other things that don't

2751
01:36:09,204 --> 01:36:10,719
wanna ask the question.

2752
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:11,775
Got it?

2753
01:36:11,775 --> 01:36:12,791
- Yes.

2754
01:36:12,791 --> 01:36:13,685
- [Gary] I know you do.

2755
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:14,437
- Yes, thank you,

2756
01:36:14,437 --> 01:36:15,432
and one more question.
- [Gary] You're welcome.

2757
01:36:15,432 --> 01:36:16,545
Yes!

2758
01:36:16,545 --> 01:36:17,269
- [Gary] That was so profound,

2759
01:36:17,269 --> 01:36:18,731
I thought that was a good place to end.

2760
01:36:18,731 --> 01:36:20,023
(laughter and cheers)

2761
01:36:20,023 --> 01:36:21,648
Now you're gonna ask
like how many characters

2762
01:36:21,648 --> 01:36:22,623
should I use in a tweet?

2763
01:36:22,623 --> 01:36:23,781
No, it was so perfect,

2764
01:36:23,781 --> 01:36:24,801
but I'm just kidding, go
ahead, what do you got?

2765
01:36:24,801 --> 01:36:26,208
- I do wanna get a picture.

2766
01:36:26,208 --> 01:36:27,061
- [Gary] Yes, you could do that.

2767
01:36:27,061 --> 01:36:28,698
- And I've been interviewing people

2768
01:36:28,698 --> 01:36:30,144
for about six years for a series

2769
01:36:30,144 --> 01:36:31,789
I do, and I would 
love to interview you.

2770
01:36:31,789 --> 01:36:33,354
I'm shaming you in front
of all these people.

2771
01:36:33,354 --> 01:36:34,573
- [Gary] Well, the good news
is you're not shaming me

2772
01:36:34,573 --> 01:36:35,934
because what you're asking for

2773
01:36:35,934 --> 01:36:39,298
is a very valuable asset,
which is the brand association

2774
01:36:39,298 --> 01:36:40,883
and right now time 
is a problem for me.

2775
01:36:40,883 --> 01:36:42,915
But, if you stay very hardcore

2776
01:36:42,915 --> 01:36:44,703
and keep persisting, I do buckle

2777
01:36:44,703 --> 01:36:45,913
under most circumstances. (laughter)

2778
01:36:45,913 --> 01:36:49,683
- Okay. (laughs heartily)

2779
01:36:49,683 --> 01:36:50,985
- I'm gonna do the book signing.

2780
01:36:50,985 --> 01:36:52,022
Listen, I've got a full hour

2781
01:36:52,022 --> 01:36:55,272
to do either book signing,
or selfie, you pick.

2782
01:36:55,272 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you very much,
ICON! (audience cheers)
