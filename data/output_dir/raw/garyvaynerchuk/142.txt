1
00:00:00,297 --> 00:00:02,165
- The reason I spend my
time talking about this

2
00:00:02,165 --> 00:00:04,175
is not because I want to be a
fucking motivational speaker

3
00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:06,781
and fluffy, fluff, fluff
and ra-ra-ra, it's because

4
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:08,864
it's the fucking thing!

5
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:11,947
â™« We're unstoppable

6
00:00:11,947 --> 00:00:13,764
- Yo, yo, yo, what up, vlog?

7
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:18,132
Busy day today, didn't
really film anything

8
00:00:18,132 --> 00:00:21,673
on this Friday, just work,
work, work, work, work.

9
00:00:21,673 --> 00:00:24,473
Did film an Ask Gary V,
how did that go, Seth,

10
00:00:24,473 --> 00:00:25,487
was it a good Ask Gary V?

11
00:00:25,487 --> 00:00:26,320
- Great one.

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,850
- Awesome, nonetheless,
gave a talk in Portland

13
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,695
a couple weeks ago to
Dutch Bros coffee company,

14
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:36,797
it turned into an epic, I mean an epic.

15
00:00:36,797 --> 00:00:37,679
D. Rock, how long was it?

16
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,601
- Two and a half hours.

17
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:41,749
- So, this is gonna be a
two-and-a-half hour episode

18
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:43,347
of DAILYVEE?

19
00:00:43,347 --> 00:00:45,596
Two and a half hour episode of DAILYVEE,

20
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:48,957
touched on a ton of new
content, I think you guys

21
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:52,124
are gonna super-enjoy it and sit back,

22
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:55,828
pour a glass of wine from
the Gary V. Wine Club,

23
00:00:55,828 --> 00:00:59,545
oh wait, what, you're not
part of the Gary V. Wine Club?

24
00:00:59,545 --> 00:01:01,022
D. Rock, are you part of the Gary V?

25
00:01:01,022 --> 00:01:03,163
You are, Seth, are you part of the--

26
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:03,996
- Not yet.

27
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:08,651
- Dude, what the fuck?

28
00:01:09,787 --> 00:01:12,768
Guys, don't be a dickface,
sign up for the Garry V.

29
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:14,556
Wine Club and watch this now.

30
00:01:14,556 --> 00:01:16,744
- Let's welcome to the
stage, Mr. Gary Vaynerchuk.

31
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,744
(audience cheering)

32
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:30,923
- Hello.

33
00:01:31,994 --> 00:01:32,827
Thank you.

34
00:01:34,147 --> 00:01:34,980
Thanks.

35
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:39,204
All right, let's go, let's
go, sit down, let's do this.

36
00:01:39,204 --> 00:01:41,704
- [Audience] Gary, Gary, Gary!

37
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:46,196
- What up?

38
00:01:46,196 --> 00:01:48,049
What up, what up, what up?

39
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:50,071
Thank you for having me, thank
you so much for the awesome

40
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:54,701
intro and reaction, very
frankly, how are we doing

41
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:57,033
the Q&A, where is the Q&A gonna come from?

42
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,343
You guys have runners?

43
00:01:59,343 --> 00:02:02,675
Awesome, cool, I just can't
wait to get to the Q&A,

44
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:05,061
so I just wanted to get
that out real quick.

45
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:06,111
And the reason why I want to do the Q&A

46
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:08,657
to be very frank, is I
think I get to speak a lot

47
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:12,309
and when I think about
speaking, at the end of the day,

48
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:15,212
I'm trying to reverse-engineer
the audience, right?

49
00:02:15,212 --> 00:02:17,667
To me, as a lot of you
know, how many people here

50
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:20,764
have seen some of my content
online, raise your hands?

51
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:24,114
Thank you, actually, real
quick, how many of you have not,

52
00:02:24,114 --> 00:02:27,150
raise your hands, okay, fuck you guys.

53
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,400
(laughing)

54
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:34,552
Kidding, kidding, kidding.

55
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:37,738
So, for about 70% of you, you
guys have seen the content

56
00:02:37,738 --> 00:02:39,710
and I'll go through certain
things that I want to talk

57
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,195
to you guys about, for
the 30% or 40% of you

58
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,094
that just raised your
hands that you haven't,

59
00:02:44,094 --> 00:02:46,406
you can go to YouTube or
Facebook and see this,

60
00:02:46,406 --> 00:02:49,472
so what's super-important
to me is to make this talk

61
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,839
contextual and when I
think about this audience,

62
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:55,233
and whether it's of age or mindset,

63
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:58,790
the youth in the offense
of this organization

64
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,791
is super-attractive to
me, from afar, right?

65
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:05,958
For me, I'm 41, I'm old,
but I feel 16 in my mind,

66
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:10,156
right, and I work like I'm 19, you know,

67
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,952
in my prime, because I'm on the offense.

68
00:03:12,952 --> 00:03:14,249
It's a mindset.

69
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:15,717
And so the thing that I
want to first start with

70
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:17,550
is intangibles, right?

71
00:03:18,838 --> 00:03:20,264
I've been thinking about this quite a bit,

72
00:03:20,264 --> 00:03:22,499
and let me tell you why this
is the first thing I want

73
00:03:22,499 --> 00:03:25,748
to start with, yesterday,
for some of you that know,

74
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:29,314
I'm a ridiculously
die-hard Jets fan, right?

75
00:03:29,314 --> 00:03:32,294
And yesterday, the Jets fucked me up

76
00:03:32,294 --> 00:03:35,547
because they won a football game.

77
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:37,284
So for some of you that
aren't into football,

78
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,459
my strategy for this
season was to go 0 and 16

79
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:42,566
and take a quarterback with the first pick

80
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:44,854
and so I literally was
in the stands yesterday

81
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:48,824
in New York, really upset
as my team was dominating

82
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:51,762
an arch rival in the Miami
Dolphins and all the fans

83
00:03:51,762 --> 00:03:53,987
around me were pissed because I was booing

84
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:55,357
when the Jets were doing good shit,

85
00:03:55,357 --> 00:03:58,107
and it was fucking awkward, okay?

86
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:00,518
But here's what happened.

87
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:03,662
The Jets took a player this
year by the name of Jamal Adams

88
00:04:03,662 --> 00:04:07,829
out of LSU and he basically
was disproportionately

89
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:12,523
impactful on the game yesterday
without doing anything

90
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:15,199
that you would normally
consider a turning point.

91
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,860
He didn't have an
interception for a touchdown,

92
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,099
he didn't do any of the
things that would show up

93
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:21,007
in the stats sheets
that would make you say,

94
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:23,585
oh he won the game as a defensive back,

95
00:04:23,585 --> 00:04:26,083
what he did was intangibles.

96
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,266
What he did was, the hour before the game,

97
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:31,541
the way he interacted
with all his teammates

98
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,817
didn't look anything like a
kid playing his third game

99
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:37,503
of his life in pros, it
looked like a 16-year veteran

100
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,915
doing the little things.

101
00:04:38,915 --> 00:04:41,844
What he did was, on every
play when the Dolphins

102
00:04:41,844 --> 00:04:44,968
made a mistake or an
off-side, he basically looked

103
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:48,663
at the entire crowd, which was
half-empty and would get them

104
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,513
excited, what he did was
when a teammate came off

105
00:04:51,513 --> 00:04:54,207
the field that made a nice
play on special teams,

106
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:56,798
he ran over and gave him dapps.

107
00:04:56,798 --> 00:05:00,965
He literally, fundamentally
willed the vibe of the game

108
00:05:02,646 --> 00:05:05,053
to go in the direction
that created the outcome.

109
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:09,913
I am not physically structured
to win all my competitive

110
00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:11,943
battles through my life.

111
00:05:11,943 --> 00:05:14,688
Yet, when I think about all
the one-on-one basketball

112
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:16,541
games or the floor hockey
matches or ping pong

113
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,697
matches or tennis or football or whatever,

114
00:05:18,697 --> 00:05:22,309
like 80% of the time when
I fucking win something

115
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:24,731
in a physical confrontation sporting event

116
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:29,296
it's because I used intangibles
to mentally outmaneuver

117
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,401
or disproportionately
figure out how to win.

118
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:34,401
I am fascinated, fascinated by this.

119
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:39,039
I am fascinated by fucking
mindset, I am fascinated

120
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,908
in a complicated world that
we're all growing up in,

121
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:45,290
it's a binary decision if
you're gonna be positive

122
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,252
or negative about shit.

123
00:05:47,252 --> 00:05:50,643
I'm fascinated that when
you're addicted to kindness

124
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:54,466
and optimism and positivity,
it just, you know,

125
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:55,299
it's so funny.

126
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:56,937
You know stuff like the secret,

127
00:05:56,937 --> 00:05:58,740
I love when people talk
about like the secret,

128
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,158
people think you sit on
your ass on your couch

129
00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:03,697
and you're like, "I wish
I had a million bucks"

130
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,145
and it's like, bloop and it just shows up.

131
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:11,290
What I'm fascinated by is
the reason people succeed

132
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,892
that put their mindset into it
is because it does something

133
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:19,055
that has really also caught
my attention over the last two

134
00:06:19,055 --> 00:06:20,659
years, which is the following.

135
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:24,459
When you bet on optimism,
when you're on the offense,

136
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:27,003
when you're playing towards intangibles,

137
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:30,047
you do something super-duper interesting.

138
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:33,175
You start suffocating excuses.

139
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:36,133
If you asked me what
the number one things is

140
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:38,610
that I'm thankful for
that my parents gave me,

141
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,551
taking me from a communist
country and moving me to the US.

142
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:44,188
You know, parenting me well, nothing bad,

143
00:06:44,188 --> 00:06:47,264
you know, roof and
clothes, all good stuff,

144
00:06:47,264 --> 00:06:49,662
if you asked me the
number one thing I wake up

145
00:06:49,662 --> 00:06:52,131
every morning and thank
that my parents did

146
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:54,164
is that I never saw either
one of them complain

147
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,144
about jack shit and they
basically created learned

148
00:06:57,144 --> 00:07:00,757
behavior for me, I'm incapable
of actually complaining

149
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:02,125
about shit.

150
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,900
And that has become the
foundation of my success.

151
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,473
When I was in my 20s
and early 30s, I spent

152
00:07:08,473 --> 00:07:12,507
eight, 15, 16, 17 hours a
day for 13 years, building

153
00:07:12,507 --> 00:07:14,112
my dad's liquor store for him,

154
00:07:14,112 --> 00:07:16,595
I own nothing of Wine Library, right,

155
00:07:16,595 --> 00:07:19,690
I leave that business in
my mid-30s, I've no wealth,

156
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,402
I've built a 60-million
dollar wine business

157
00:07:21,402 --> 00:07:24,060
for my dad and I don't
sit there and complain,

158
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,877
I think about it as I did
the right thing by thanking

159
00:07:26,877 --> 00:07:29,578
my parents and giving back.

160
00:07:29,578 --> 00:07:32,486
Literally, literally, no joke,
if I leave this conference

161
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:34,774
today, right now, if I
leave, right, if we do this,

162
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:36,573
we have a nice little
Q&A, it's a good talk,

163
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:39,368
it's fucking cool, I leave,
I go to cross a street

164
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:40,819
to go into my car, to go to the airport,

165
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:43,569
and I get hit by a car,
literally as I'm laying there,

166
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:46,037
I'd be like fuck, I shouldn't
have left the conference

167
00:07:46,037 --> 00:07:46,954
that early.

168
00:07:47,896 --> 00:07:50,956
It is in my mindset that
literally every negative thing

169
00:07:50,956 --> 00:07:53,837
that happens to me is my fucking fault.

170
00:07:53,837 --> 00:07:57,214
I recognize that that's
not true, you know,

171
00:07:57,214 --> 00:07:59,287
when I talk about this publicly,

172
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:01,644
everybody starts bringing up
stuff like what if you're raped

173
00:08:01,644 --> 00:08:04,171
and what if you're this
and that, I understand.

174
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:07,134
I'm a logical, practical
person, I'm not talking about

175
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:10,968
knowing or thinking
everything is my fault,

176
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:13,376
I'm talking about living
a life where you default

177
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:17,065
into believing that as your
mindset because what happens

178
00:08:17,065 --> 00:08:20,074
is you start spending all
of your time on offense.

179
00:08:20,074 --> 00:08:23,404
My friends, listen, here's
what fucking freaks me the

180
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:26,987
fuck out, do you
understand, you like that?

181
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:32,458
Let me get to it, it's
really interesting to me,

182
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,295
I wish everybody in this
conference, including myself

183
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:38,785
by the way, who spends
all this time on this,

184
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,033
I wish we had better perspective.

185
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:42,764
I wish that there was some fucking crazy,

186
00:08:42,764 --> 00:08:44,927
that dude right there with
the weird fucking horse

187
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:48,487
T-shirt, I wish he was some
weird genie that could take us

188
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:52,446
back in time 80 years ago
so that every one of you

189
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:55,172
could live one fucking
day in your great, great

190
00:08:55,172 --> 00:08:58,177
grandparents shoes and
understand how fucking good

191
00:08:58,177 --> 00:09:02,015
you have, like if you
really, really understood

192
00:09:02,015 --> 00:09:04,228
how amazing the era we live in

193
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:08,074
and listen, I'm not
naive to what's happening

194
00:09:08,074 --> 00:09:11,758
in our society, I'm aware
of the political current

195
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:13,878
climate, I'm aware of everything.

196
00:09:13,878 --> 00:09:16,317
Let me just say thins very
clear so everybody gets it

197
00:09:16,317 --> 00:09:20,059
through their fucking
dome, this is the greatest

198
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:24,059
year to ever be alive in
the history of mankind.

199
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:30,976
I am super-empathetic, again,
when you make those kind

200
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:33,342
of statements, do I believe that there is

201
00:09:33,342 --> 00:09:34,370
suppression around?

202
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,537
Of course, but on a macro
data, macro data, health,

203
00:09:39,473 --> 00:09:42,485
life expectancy, how much
hate and negativity actually

204
00:09:42,485 --> 00:09:46,773
is in the complete
world, this is the best.

205
00:09:46,773 --> 00:09:50,560
We have it the best and all I
see is people sitting around

206
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,669
and dwelling around dumb
shit around what they don't

207
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:56,256
have instead of focusing
on what they do have.

208
00:09:56,256 --> 00:10:00,089
My friends, the internet
is a fucking miracle.

209
00:10:00,992 --> 00:10:04,139
It's a fucking miracle, the
scalability in which you can

210
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:06,603
achieve, the things
that you could be doing,

211
00:10:06,603 --> 00:10:08,993
the fact that you could
be laying fucking naked

212
00:10:08,993 --> 00:10:10,543
in your bed at two in the morning

213
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:14,925
and doing productive
shit is fucking crazy.

214
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:18,551
It's crazy, if you got your side hustle,

215
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,159
if you think about your side hustle

216
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,051
or you're crushing it
with these guys and doing

217
00:10:23,051 --> 00:10:25,630
side hustle, there was
no side hustle for your

218
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,577
great-great-grandparents.

219
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:30,541
Like, when it was 9 p.m. it
was dark and cold outside,

220
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,208
it wasn't practical.

221
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:37,154
We take things for granted,
do you know how upset,

222
00:10:37,154 --> 00:10:39,258
do you know what's crazy to me?

223
00:10:39,258 --> 00:10:42,925
How mad I get when my internet
is a hundredth of a second

224
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:45,342
slower than what I'm used to.

225
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:49,778
Like, literally, a
hundredth of a second slower

226
00:10:49,778 --> 00:10:51,961
and I feel it because I'm
used to what speed it's

227
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:55,588
supposed to be and that's
frustrating like on a plane

228
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,525
because the Wi-Fi on the
plane is a little slow

229
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,740
which is so ridiculous because
I'm on a fucking plane,

230
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,573
and then it's Wi-Fi, it's there, I'm old,

231
00:11:04,573 --> 00:11:08,605
I remember not having it,
it's crazy how quickly

232
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:10,855
we take things for granted.

233
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:16,140
So, London just banned Uber
and my buddy landed there

234
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,970
and he's like what the fuck am I gonna do?

235
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,925
I'm like, I don't know, what
everybody has done for the

236
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:23,342
last 300 years, dickface, take the train.

237
00:11:26,277 --> 00:11:29,027
We just get used to shit so fast.

238
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:33,464
And in our speed of getting
used to how fucking awesome

239
00:11:33,464 --> 00:11:37,306
it is, I'm just desperate
this afternoon for you

240
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:40,965
to not lose perspective,
perspective is the fucking game,

241
00:11:40,965 --> 00:11:41,861
right?

242
00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:44,929
Both my grandpa, look,
I sit up here, get paid

243
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:47,770
super-duper-duper-well, get
people to think I'm cool

244
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,552
because I have entrepreneurial
DNA and the timing of it

245
00:11:51,552 --> 00:11:53,710
was cool because entrepreneurs got cool.

246
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:57,210
Both my grandfathers had
the same exact thing I had

247
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,743
and because they were
Jewish in communist Russia

248
00:11:59,743 --> 00:12:02,532
post World War Two,
their communism put them

249
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:06,305
both in jail for 10 years in Siberia.

250
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:09,888
Just think about that,
timing, opportunity,

251
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:14,384
yes, it is absolutely
difficult for all of us,

252
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:17,599
we all have stuff, do
I believe a white male

253
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:18,558
has more privilege?

254
00:12:18,558 --> 00:12:21,324
Of course, yes I do, here's my problem,

255
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:25,927
if anybody has ever done
it with your circumstances,

256
00:12:25,927 --> 00:12:28,208
then you have nothing to
talk about in the mindset

257
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,711
that I want for you to win.

258
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:33,268
If anybody has ever
achieved something with two

259
00:12:33,268 --> 00:12:37,308
alcoholic parents, that's the
blueprint that you can follow

260
00:12:37,308 --> 00:12:38,846
versus looking the other way.

261
00:12:38,846 --> 00:12:43,545
Life is binary, it's
either offense or defense,

262
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:45,579
you are there sitting
in your seat right now

263
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:48,190
on the offense or you're
not, there is no fucking

264
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,687
half-pregnant, there is no
in-between, you're either

265
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,770
this or that.

266
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:57,003
And so, I come here with the
energy to let you know about

267
00:12:57,003 --> 00:13:00,022
how I see it from afar
not knowing every nuance

268
00:13:00,022 --> 00:13:03,025
of your life, A, I think this
is the greatest opportunity

269
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:07,124
to be alive because the
internet has created infinite

270
00:13:07,124 --> 00:13:08,800
opportunity for all of us.

271
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,885
B, I love something
that I'm fascinated by,

272
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:13,788
which is that everything gets accelerated.

273
00:13:13,788 --> 00:13:15,867
What you're living through
right now, my friends,

274
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:18,393
in society and the business
world, is everything is

275
00:13:18,393 --> 00:13:20,845
getting accelerated, what
the internet has done,

276
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:24,168
it hasn't changed us, it's exposed us.

277
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:26,695
What the internet has
done is not necessarily

278
00:13:26,695 --> 00:13:29,136
suppress things, it's made
everything at the forefront,

279
00:13:29,136 --> 00:13:32,040
there is no hiding,
everything is so clear,

280
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,368
out in the open, difficult to hide.

281
00:13:34,368 --> 00:13:36,942
And so I'm fascinated by thing
because it leads to bigger

282
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,891
opportunity, the speed
at which good can happen

283
00:13:39,891 --> 00:13:43,441
is extraordinary, it just
comes down to actions.

284
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:45,990
So, what's really happening?

285
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,199
This first and foremost, this
device, if you're sitting

286
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,685
in your seat and you
have any entrepreneurial,

287
00:13:51,685 --> 00:13:55,239
intrapreneurial DNA, aka,
do you want to be the CEO

288
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:57,372
of this company one day
and grow in the ranks

289
00:13:57,372 --> 00:13:59,365
or do you want to do something
for yourself one day,

290
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:02,271
if you have either one, which
I assume is one or the other

291
00:14:02,271 --> 00:14:04,916
inside your body, you have
to take a step back and

292
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,716
wrap your head around the
following, this right here,

293
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:11,204
this device is the remote
control of our society,

294
00:14:11,204 --> 00:14:12,787
this is everything.

295
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:16,080
Everybody keeps trying to
tell people to spend less time

296
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,605
on this, I recommend you
spend all your time on it.

297
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:21,557
I don't give a fuck if you look at another

298
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:23,640
human being's eyes again.

299
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:25,810
This.

300
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,408
This.

301
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,810
Because where do you
think the world is going,

302
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,150
I have two young kids now
and I love all these parents,

303
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,894
like, Gary, you're into
this social media stuff,

304
00:14:32,894 --> 00:14:33,852
this is terrible, right?

305
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:35,835
I'm like, no, Dick, this is the best,

306
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:38,657
because, they're like,
"But I'm gonna tell my kid

307
00:14:38,657 --> 00:14:40,446
"to spend less time on technology."

308
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,739
I'm like, why, what world
do you think your kids

309
00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:45,804
are gonna be living in 20 years?

310
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:49,971
I love the naivete, the
naivete, this is all history,

311
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:54,060
my friends, people thinking
we're gonna go backwards,

312
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,337
every person in this
room is gonna be wearing

313
00:14:56,337 --> 00:15:00,325
contact lenses full time,
on their body in 20 years

314
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:04,492
and triggering between real
life, augmented reality,

315
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,876
where I don't know, Santa is
on here, on stage with me,

316
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:11,656
right, and complete virtual reality.

317
00:15:11,656 --> 00:15:14,839
Everybody in here, in 20 or
25 years is going to be living

318
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,482
a mixed reality world, you
may not like it, you may think

319
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:21,047
it's weird, but people
used to think online dating

320
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:24,057
was weird, people used to
think the internet was weird,

321
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:26,453
people definitely thought
sending a 14-year-old girl

322
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:29,308
into a stranger's car was
super-weird and that's

323
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:31,917
what we do with all our
daughters now at 14,

324
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:34,168
and put them into Ubers
and strange men's cars

325
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:38,140
every day, social norms
are changing at a speed

326
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,052
we've never seen before.

327
00:15:40,052 --> 00:15:43,534
So, this amplification of
everything is what I want to focus

328
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:46,363
on right now, I wrote a
book six years ago called

329
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:48,856
the Thank You Economy, I want
to talk to you guys about it

330
00:15:48,856 --> 00:15:51,553
today, because it maters
to most of you right now.

331
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:56,189
It is stunning to me how
doing a good deed now travels

332
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:59,108
to such greater length
than it ever did before.

333
00:15:59,108 --> 00:16:02,632
To me, if you took anything
away from my talk before

334
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:05,554
I go into the Q&A, I want you
to understand the following,

335
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:08,221
somebody is always watching now.

336
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,505
There is no interaction that you're having

337
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:15,055
ever again that is just
between you and that person.

338
00:16:15,055 --> 00:16:17,634
And let me tell you why I
want you to think this way,

339
00:16:17,634 --> 00:16:20,686
though that may be true,
because it becomes he said,

340
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:24,450
she said, thought that
may be true, if you switch

341
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,502
and live the mindset that
I've been living for the last

342
00:16:27,502 --> 00:16:29,929
seven years, I really believe
that a lot of good things

343
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:32,765
will happen for you, if you
believe that every single

344
00:16:32,765 --> 00:16:35,170
thing that you do is on the record,

345
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,571
you'll be stunned by how
your behavior changes.

346
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:41,722
If you actually believe
that every single thing

347
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:44,559
you do is actually being
documented, is actually

348
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:47,616
going to be recorded, is
actually being watched,

349
00:16:47,616 --> 00:16:51,010
a miraculous thing happens,
you change your behavior,

350
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,503
not that you go from being
a dick to being phenomenal,

351
00:16:54,503 --> 00:16:56,617
and I'm telling you
because I've been living it

352
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:59,425
for the last decade, you
just start sliding every

353
00:16:59,425 --> 00:17:02,752
so often a little bit
towards a better place

354
00:17:02,752 --> 00:17:05,298
and start changing your
behavior and what happens

355
00:17:05,298 --> 00:17:08,487
is you start having
momentum of positivity.

356
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:12,077
I believe that karma is
practical, I believe that doing

357
00:17:12,077 --> 00:17:14,387
the right thing is always the right thing,

358
00:17:14,387 --> 00:17:18,359
and so how many people here
are managers, raise your hands.

359
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,570
Actually, can you guys stand
up, if you're managers,

360
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,373
can you stand up real
quick, don't get lazy on me,

361
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,606
let's get the blood going,

362
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:26,621
let's not clap up for them,
they don't need to be clapped,

363
00:17:26,621 --> 00:17:29,038
I'm trying, fine, clap, clap.

364
00:17:34,078 --> 00:17:37,621
All right, you can sit,
can we keep the lights on,

365
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:40,726
it's better, I like seeing their faces.

366
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,127
I'm fascinated by management,
how many people became

367
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:48,208
a manager within the last
two years, raise your hand.

368
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,593
Funny shit, right?

369
00:17:49,593 --> 00:17:51,672
It used to be fun saying
your manager was a dickface

370
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:53,553
until you became one.

371
00:17:53,553 --> 00:17:54,623
(laughing)

372
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:57,468
And now you're like, oh now I get it.

373
00:17:57,468 --> 00:17:59,380
Management is super-interesting to me,

374
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,486
I'm super-fascinated by
it, I have 800 employees

375
00:18:01,486 --> 00:18:03,460
at VaynerMedia and I
love watching somebody go

376
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,889
from super star, entry
or specs tier and when

377
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:09,398
they go to management,
shit changes because

378
00:18:09,398 --> 00:18:11,458
everything flips.

379
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:15,883
Let me tell you something,
managers, I run VaynerMedia,

380
00:18:15,883 --> 00:18:19,966
I'm the CEO, 800 employees,
I work for everybody.

381
00:18:22,596 --> 00:18:26,763
I don't have people working
for me, I work for everybody.

382
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:31,255
The biggest issue that
managers have when they make

383
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:34,616
that leap, is they get very
fucking confused, they think

384
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:38,023
that people work for them
and they don't understand

385
00:18:38,023 --> 00:18:40,640
that they're working for those people.

386
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,432
So, when I think about
the Thank You Economy

387
00:18:42,432 --> 00:18:44,569
and being documented and
what I really want from you,

388
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:46,908
I'm not here to raz the
managers, I want everybody

389
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:49,360
who just stood up to get to
the place that they want to

390
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,753
in their lives and in their
careers and I want to suffocate,

391
00:18:52,753 --> 00:18:55,143
real quick, for all of them
to leave their fucking fancy

392
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:59,030
PoVs at the fucking door,
because what happens as you grow

393
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,689
up the ranks of society
and life and in business,

394
00:19:01,689 --> 00:19:05,717
is you have to start
deploying humility, not ego.

395
00:19:05,717 --> 00:19:07,971
And that has been the
most fascinating thing

396
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:09,796
that I have watched throughout my career,

397
00:19:09,796 --> 00:19:11,939
watching that shift become difficult,

398
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:16,275
because the way to succeed
within an organization

399
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:18,977
that has people working
is you have to figure out

400
00:19:18,977 --> 00:19:23,487
how to learn to eat shit
and that is super-difficult

401
00:19:23,487 --> 00:19:27,288
and the higher up you
go, the more shit you

402
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:31,335
have to eat, the amount of
shit that I eat every day

403
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:34,278
is so fucking staggering to me,

404
00:19:34,278 --> 00:19:38,077
and it is basically the
blueprint of my success and every

405
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,785
other person that I have seen.

406
00:19:39,785 --> 00:19:43,149
Literally your ability to
be the bigger man and woman

407
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:46,486
in every situation, even
though nine out of 10 times,

408
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:50,298
you may be right is the
variable of your success

409
00:19:50,298 --> 00:19:54,049
both within your organization
and compounded when you

410
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:56,230
go out into the real world
and this takes me back

411
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,340
to where I started.

412
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,465
Please understand the following,

413
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,715
being nice is ROI positive.

414
00:20:04,074 --> 00:20:07,845
It is traveling, it is
be known, it is leverage,

415
00:20:07,845 --> 00:20:11,148
the ability to be not nice, politicking,

416
00:20:11,148 --> 00:20:15,920
on the defense, always
wins up-front, which is why

417
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,748
people are seduced by it.

418
00:20:17,748 --> 00:20:20,149
But it never wins the
long game, you're winning

419
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:22,789
the sprint for about 40
seconds, but you never

420
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,679
win the marathon of
what's being played here.

421
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,855
It is now compounded
because information about us

422
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:31,747
travels at a level
we've never seen before.

423
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:35,747
Being a dick in Portland
in 1974 was super fine,

424
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:40,103
because you could move to Minnesota.

425
00:20:40,103 --> 00:20:43,483
That information now
travels with us at scale,

426
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:46,354
you don't even want to
know how much of a jerk

427
00:20:46,354 --> 00:20:49,488
your great-great-grandfather
was, all that stuff

428
00:20:49,488 --> 00:20:51,064
is lost in history.

429
00:20:51,064 --> 00:20:53,998
All of our baggage, here forever.

430
00:20:53,998 --> 00:20:56,701
The biggest thing I remind
people when they go on tilt,

431
00:20:56,701 --> 00:20:59,066
whether it's politics or life or whatever,

432
00:20:59,066 --> 00:21:00,890
is just remember, everything you're saying

433
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,332
is going to be there forever.

434
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:05,708
Everybody in this room is
going to have a conversation

435
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,362
with their granddaughter and
they're gonna have to explain

436
00:21:08,362 --> 00:21:10,665
their points of view on everything.

437
00:21:10,665 --> 00:21:12,921
Let's forget politics, life.

438
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:14,481
Everything.

439
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,890
And so I'm fascinated by
thing dynamic, I think it's

440
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,399
a super-interesting time,
and I really want to,

441
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:22,660
not inspire, it's really
funny, I think about,

442
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,912
I don't get a super-high to
inspire and make a fun event,

443
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:30,897
I get a super-high on the
emails I read on the way out

444
00:21:30,897 --> 00:21:32,416
to this flight this morning.

445
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,888
The people that were in the
audience, the guy who just told

446
00:21:34,888 --> 00:21:37,889
me backstage, when he saw
me speak two years ago,

447
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:39,613
quit his job and went on the offense.

448
00:21:39,613 --> 00:21:42,030
I'm in for one thing, legacy.

449
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:46,004
I'm in it for one person
sitting here, emailing me

450
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,974
in six years and saying, you
know, I was a little fancy

451
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,342
as a manager until you came
to Portland, I was a little

452
00:21:51,342 --> 00:21:55,171
high on myself and thinking
I was special, I was building

453
00:21:55,171 --> 00:21:58,332
towards the wrong path
that wasn't going to be

454
00:21:58,332 --> 00:21:59,615
historically correct.

455
00:21:59,615 --> 00:22:02,689
And I am just fascinated by
the fact that that the most

456
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:06,291
simple of traits now
is the fundamental game

457
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:09,077
we're playing, that is
crazy to me, as we go more

458
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,556
Jetsons, the people that
know how to play like the

459
00:22:11,556 --> 00:22:13,132
Flintstones are gonna win.

460
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,160
Literally I believe the manners that your

461
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,441
great-great-grandparents
have are far more suited

462
00:22:18,441 --> 00:22:21,142
for where we're going
than the majority of us.

463
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:23,402
Now, we don't realize
what's actually happening

464
00:22:23,402 --> 00:22:25,859
in front of us, which is we are all,

465
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:28,638
not just me, all day putting out content,

466
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,709
D. Rock, where you at?

467
00:22:30,709 --> 00:22:32,872
Not just having a weird
dude following you around

468
00:22:32,872 --> 00:22:37,263
full time, filming you,
not me, all of you.

469
00:22:37,263 --> 00:22:40,436
Maybe mine's an extreme
version, but for all of you,

470
00:22:40,436 --> 00:22:43,713
all of you, you are
documenting your entire life

471
00:22:43,713 --> 00:22:45,130
at scale forever.

472
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,548
And when you start wrapping
your head around that,

473
00:22:49,548 --> 00:22:51,044
two things unfold.

474
00:22:51,044 --> 00:22:55,211
I hope, for 95% of you, number
one, the quality of the life

475
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:58,953
that you're trying to live
as a human so that you're

476
00:22:58,953 --> 00:23:01,093
proud about the conversation
you have at 60, 70

477
00:23:01,093 --> 00:23:04,620
and 80 and when you get
there, a funny thing happens,

478
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,458
as you push yourself to be a
better fucking human being,

479
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:11,785
better things start happening
for you in your actual

480
00:23:11,785 --> 00:23:14,535
selfish business wants and needs.

481
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:19,750
And so, I hope that I
can suffocate and ignite

482
00:23:21,993 --> 00:23:25,063
a mindset here today of
people actually understanding

483
00:23:25,063 --> 00:23:25,919
what they're doing.

484
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,779
Think about all the dumb shit
you believe five years ago

485
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:30,785
that you don't believe anymore.

486
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:34,118
We keep evolving, we
keep changing as we grow.

487
00:23:34,118 --> 00:23:37,575
I implore you to understand
how big the stakes are

488
00:23:37,575 --> 00:23:39,673
in the world that you live in right now.

489
00:23:39,673 --> 00:23:42,381
The opportunity is so ridiculous.

490
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:44,285
And so let's get into the
details before I get into

491
00:23:44,285 --> 00:23:45,285
Q&A of this.

492
00:23:46,345 --> 00:23:48,907
I am desperate for every
person in this room

493
00:23:48,907 --> 00:23:51,501
to understand couple of piece of data.

494
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:53,898
Number one, if you believe
that this is the remote

495
00:23:53,898 --> 00:23:56,013
control of our society the way I do,

496
00:23:56,013 --> 00:23:58,174
then it gets really interesting
when you start thinking

497
00:23:58,174 --> 00:23:59,673
about social media.

498
00:23:59,673 --> 00:24:02,235
Social media is this nice
little, in my marketing world,

499
00:24:02,235 --> 00:24:04,718
it's a slang term for
nice to have, that you

500
00:24:04,718 --> 00:24:06,685
support with television,
things of that nature,

501
00:24:06,685 --> 00:24:10,260
I see a lot of young
faces, it's norm for you,

502
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,642
it's the main communication
funnel, but it probably

503
00:24:12,642 --> 00:24:15,551
has a balance between
business and your real life

504
00:24:15,551 --> 00:24:17,344
of what you're doing as a human.

505
00:24:17,344 --> 00:24:18,709
I need everybody to understand something,

506
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:21,946
more than 50% of the time
spent by all Americans

507
00:24:21,946 --> 00:24:25,149
on a cellphone is on a social network.

508
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:27,732
This is pretty much the punchline.

509
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:31,386
How many people here are
retiring in 10 years,

510
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,867
and I don't mean you're gonna
open up a bunch of these

511
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:35,907
and you're gonna fucking
crush it and buy an island,

512
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:39,308
I mean, you're fucking
old and you're finished?

513
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:42,432
How many people are retiring
in the next 10 years?

514
00:24:42,432 --> 00:24:43,432
Great, zero.

515
00:24:44,498 --> 00:24:47,768
So, for everybody here, please
understand the following,

516
00:24:47,768 --> 00:24:51,027
everything, everything that
is running our society's

517
00:24:51,027 --> 00:24:53,193
attention right now, Facebook and YouTube

518
00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:55,653
and Instagram and SnapChat and Twitter,

519
00:24:55,653 --> 00:24:58,903
everything, 12 years ago did not exist.

520
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:03,805
The smartphone did not
exist, Uber did not exist,

521
00:25:03,805 --> 00:25:07,080
Airbnb did not exist, nothing.

522
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,870
You know, back to the
awesome dude with the fucking

523
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:15,511
horse T-shirt, the reason I
wish you could take everybody

524
00:25:15,511 --> 00:25:18,924
back is we don't have
context to how remarkable,

525
00:25:18,924 --> 00:25:21,601
it's tough, the people that lived

526
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:24,452
during the Great Depression,
the people that lived

527
00:25:24,452 --> 00:25:26,102
during the World Wars,
people that lived during

528
00:25:26,102 --> 00:25:29,666
the industrial revolution, it's
hard because it's our lives,

529
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:33,675
it's hard for us to understand
how different it is for us

530
00:25:33,675 --> 00:25:35,399
than the prior two generations.

531
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:38,036
It's difficult because you
have no context to anything

532
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,812
else, but the stakes and
opportunity are all time,

533
00:25:41,812 --> 00:25:43,360
they're all time.

534
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,249
Our great-great-grandkids, everybody else,

535
00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:48,652
will look back at this era as the moment.

536
00:25:48,652 --> 00:25:51,417
So, I implore you to take
a step back and really

537
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:53,750
fundamentally ask yourselves
a couple of questions,

538
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,934
one, what legacy are you
building because it will be

539
00:25:55,934 --> 00:25:57,560
the leverage for everything that you want

540
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,239
over the next 60 years and
that is based on your actions,

541
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:03,669
and two, very honestly,
are you squeezing the shit

542
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:06,680
out of this moment as much as you can?

543
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,713
The thing that I'm super-passionate
about as a lot of you

544
00:26:08,713 --> 00:26:12,261
know is I think work ethic
is the one thing that's

545
00:26:12,261 --> 00:26:14,293
super-fucking controllable.

546
00:26:14,293 --> 00:26:15,193
Right?

547
00:26:15,193 --> 00:26:17,657
A lot of us were born with
what we were born with,

548
00:26:17,657 --> 00:26:20,780
you're only so pretty,
you're only so smart,

549
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:24,263
you're only so fast,
you're only what you are,

550
00:26:24,263 --> 00:26:27,610
the one thing that I'm
fascinated by as you sit here,

551
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,050
the way you were parented,
where you were born,

552
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:33,301
what you got, the one thing
that actually is in your

553
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:37,233
control is the decisions of
what you do with your hand.

554
00:26:37,233 --> 00:26:39,110
It's like a great poker player, right?

555
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,151
A great poker player doesn't
need the best hand every

556
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:44,752
time to win, it's how she or
he navigates with that hand.

557
00:26:44,752 --> 00:26:47,966
We're not gonna change who
we are or where we were born

558
00:26:47,966 --> 00:26:51,103
or to whom we were born with,
but no matter where you are

559
00:26:51,103 --> 00:26:53,796
in the lifecycle right now,
we all have the opportunity

560
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:55,423
to start looking at it a little different,

561
00:26:55,423 --> 00:26:58,108
and to me, very frankly,
I just think we spend

562
00:26:58,108 --> 00:27:01,544
an enormous amount of time on dumb shit

563
00:27:01,544 --> 00:27:04,162
when we have ambition to do so much more.

564
00:27:04,162 --> 00:27:08,049
Now look, you do you, I'm
not interested in peddling

565
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:10,664
being a workaholic, I'm really not.

566
00:27:10,664 --> 00:27:12,380
You can do whatever you want.

567
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,544
The happiest friend I know
from growing up, I think

568
00:27:15,544 --> 00:27:18,245
he makes $50,000 a year,
he's on 17 fucking softball

569
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:21,831
teams, he takes every vacation day off,

570
00:27:21,831 --> 00:27:25,687
and he's happy as shit and
I love him and it makes me

571
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:26,690
so damn happy.

572
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,934
I have friends who are
employees at Facebook,

573
00:27:28,934 --> 00:27:30,543
they have a hundred million
dollars in their bank,

574
00:27:30,543 --> 00:27:32,124
and they're miserable and it's shit.

575
00:27:32,124 --> 00:27:33,837
This is not a money conversation,

576
00:27:33,837 --> 00:27:36,837
this is very simply, do your actions

577
00:27:38,108 --> 00:27:39,691
back up your mouth?

578
00:27:42,364 --> 00:27:45,537
To me, looking at hashtag,
looking at people talking

579
00:27:45,537 --> 00:27:48,686
about this, looking at their social media,

580
00:27:48,686 --> 00:27:50,490
when I have the whole
East Coast to West Coast

581
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,668
long flight, I get into
a lot of work, I get

582
00:27:52,668 --> 00:27:54,593
all my work done and then
I start looking at all

583
00:27:54,593 --> 00:27:56,964
of your social media on the way here.

584
00:27:56,964 --> 00:27:59,481
And I'd look at the
hashtag and what you said

585
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:02,709
about the earlier speaker
and I do my thing, right?

586
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:05,991
The thing that fascinated me
a lot about this conference

587
00:28:05,991 --> 00:28:08,639
is you've got a lot of people peacocking

588
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:13,047
in this organization, aka,
a lot of you are talking

589
00:28:13,047 --> 00:28:15,842
big shit and I don't mean
about this conference,

590
00:28:15,842 --> 00:28:17,581
I went back and looked at all your tweets,

591
00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:19,733
did you know there are 37
billionaires sitting with us

592
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:20,840
today?

593
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,777
I'm fascinated by that, I'm
fascinated because we're

594
00:28:23,777 --> 00:28:26,768
sitting in a world right
now where entrepreneurship

595
00:28:26,768 --> 00:28:29,650
is on a pedestal of cool,
and so everybody is flocked

596
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,793
to it and everybody is talking
about how they're gonna

597
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,263
crush and what they're gonna
do and who they're gonna be

598
00:28:34,263 --> 00:28:38,430
and then you look at their
content, and every Friday night,

599
00:28:39,996 --> 00:28:42,905
they're at a fucking concert,
and every Sunday morning

600
00:28:42,905 --> 00:28:45,587
they're this and every Tuesday
afternoon they're that,

601
00:28:45,587 --> 00:28:48,021
and they watch a shit-load
of fucking Netflix

602
00:28:48,021 --> 00:28:49,972
and they're incredible
at fucking Candy Crush

603
00:28:49,972 --> 00:28:52,472
and fucking, fucking, fucking.

604
00:28:54,156 --> 00:28:58,173
And so, I go on this rant
not to do anything to raz

605
00:28:58,173 --> 00:28:59,949
or to fucking call anybody out,

606
00:28:59,949 --> 00:29:02,569
I'm just asking a very simple question.

607
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:06,312
I promise you, if you want
to be pumped professionally

608
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:09,085
and personally there's one
thing that will drive you

609
00:29:09,085 --> 00:29:12,475
to the biggest success,
it's called self-awareness.

610
00:29:12,475 --> 00:29:15,494
Do you know who you are, do
you know who you're about?

611
00:29:15,494 --> 00:29:18,168
Are you actually talking about
shit that you care about,

612
00:29:18,168 --> 00:29:21,358
are you talking because three
or four people that you love

613
00:29:21,358 --> 00:29:24,065
talk that game and you
feel like you got to fit in

614
00:29:24,065 --> 00:29:27,833
or appease your mom or dad or
uncle or aunt or grandmother's

615
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,420
ambition?

616
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,800
The thing that helped me so
much was just self-awareness.

617
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,058
In fourth grade I punted school because

618
00:29:35,058 --> 00:29:38,040
I knew I sucked at it, I
knew I could make $3,000

619
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,384
a weekend as a 10-year-old
selling baseball cards,

620
00:29:40,384 --> 00:29:42,883
but I couldn't spell 90%
of the words that were

621
00:29:42,883 --> 00:29:44,352
being thrown at me.

622
00:29:44,352 --> 00:29:46,897
It was just who I was,
it was how I was wired,

623
00:29:46,897 --> 00:29:51,408
and I implore everybody in
this conference to really think

624
00:29:51,408 --> 00:29:53,741
about this incredibly interesting thing

625
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:58,095
which is when you're self-aware
and you can get to that

626
00:29:58,095 --> 00:30:00,981
place of understanding
yourself, I implore you

627
00:30:00,981 --> 00:30:02,814
to triple down on your strengths

628
00:30:02,814 --> 00:30:05,425
and punt your weaknesses.

629
00:30:05,425 --> 00:30:09,469
This country is really good
at selling down our throats

630
00:30:09,469 --> 00:30:11,271
what we're not good at.

631
00:30:11,271 --> 00:30:14,128
We're always being sold what to fix.

632
00:30:14,128 --> 00:30:17,588
I truly believe that
most people in this room

633
00:30:17,588 --> 00:30:20,758
will succeed by not
addressing those things,

634
00:30:20,758 --> 00:30:23,187
now, something could be
fatal, right, something

635
00:30:23,187 --> 00:30:25,445
could really hurt you, but I
think that you need to just

636
00:30:25,445 --> 00:30:28,565
lift those, get them to a certain place

637
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:30,480
where they're not a
vulnerability and triple down

638
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,260
on your charisma and triple
down on your salesmanship

639
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,064
and triple down on your work ethic.

640
00:30:37,064 --> 00:30:39,986
Whatever those, three to
four, one, two, three, four,

641
00:30:39,986 --> 00:30:42,543
five pillars are, it's
fascinating when you study

642
00:30:42,543 --> 00:30:45,951
who's winning and who's not,
it's the people that have

643
00:30:45,951 --> 00:30:49,951
the confidence to suck
at shit that are winning.

644
00:30:51,402 --> 00:30:52,485
I can't read.

645
00:30:53,842 --> 00:30:54,675
Right?

646
00:30:55,557 --> 00:30:59,513
I'm terrible at it, like,
reading a second grade book

647
00:30:59,513 --> 00:31:02,347
to my daughter is like, you
sure you want me to read,

648
00:31:02,347 --> 00:31:05,198
you should go look at a bird.

649
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:08,478
Yet, standing in front of
800,000 people, I'm like, cool,

650
00:31:08,478 --> 00:31:11,059
I'm good, we need to start
thinking more and more

651
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:13,104
and as you're going through
your careers right now,

652
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:16,279
I implore you to be confident
in what you're good at

653
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:18,889
and to punt what you suck at,

654
00:31:18,889 --> 00:31:22,330
because I promise you, everybody
else sucks at shit too.

655
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,604
Everybody's got strengths and weaknesses

656
00:31:24,604 --> 00:31:27,392
and I'm fascinated by
people's obsession to pour

657
00:31:27,392 --> 00:31:30,426
all of their efforts into
fixing the weaknesses,

658
00:31:30,426 --> 00:31:33,878
which is playing defense, and
not tripling down on their

659
00:31:33,878 --> 00:31:35,565
strengths, so if I
leave you with anything,

660
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:37,705
structurally from a strategy standpoint

661
00:31:37,705 --> 00:31:41,146
and mindset standpoint, I
highly implore you on that.

662
00:31:41,146 --> 00:31:41,979
And that's it.

663
00:31:41,979 --> 00:31:44,407
Those are the things that
are really kind of happening

664
00:31:44,407 --> 00:31:48,324
to me, I'm fascinated
that we're in this era.

665
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:52,407
I want people to take bigger
advantages of it, right?

666
00:31:52,407 --> 00:31:55,828
I need people to understand
how ridiculously unbelievable

667
00:31:55,828 --> 00:32:00,818
it is and to figure out
do they really want stuff,

668
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:04,663
how many people love working
because they just love the game

669
00:32:04,663 --> 00:32:08,650
of trying to win at a career
or building a business?

670
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:11,588
Raise your hands, those
people are gonna have

671
00:32:11,588 --> 00:32:13,338
a disproportionate
advantage because it doesn't

672
00:32:13,338 --> 00:32:15,645
feel like work, it's just their zone.

673
00:32:15,645 --> 00:32:18,085
For the rest of you, you
need to figure out what

674
00:32:18,085 --> 00:32:20,697
you like about it and spend
all your time on that,

675
00:32:20,697 --> 00:32:22,938
because if you're in a place
where you don't like it,

676
00:32:22,938 --> 00:32:25,583
you're not gonna put in the
amount of work that's needed

677
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:29,351
to actually achieve the
things that most of you want.

678
00:32:29,351 --> 00:32:31,794
It's very, very simple, put yourself

679
00:32:31,794 --> 00:32:34,415
in a position to succeed.

680
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:36,996
Put yourself in a position to succeed.

681
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,815
And how many people here
feel like they are not

682
00:32:39,815 --> 00:32:40,814
self-aware?

683
00:32:40,814 --> 00:32:42,504
Because I want to address this if I can,

684
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:45,152
just raise your hands if
you struggle a little bit

685
00:32:45,152 --> 00:32:47,303
with self-awareness, raise your hands,

686
00:32:47,303 --> 00:32:49,865
nobody wants to do that.

687
00:32:49,865 --> 00:32:53,414
I'll just go to it, I
respect that's a tough one,

688
00:32:53,414 --> 00:32:55,730
and why we got half the
hands that we should have

689
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,008
and more importantly the ones that we got

690
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,791
were fucking crocodile hands.

691
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:02,041
(laughing)

692
00:33:03,422 --> 00:33:04,670
If you were listening for
the last seven minutes,

693
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:09,103
I'm going through awkward
territory, I'm going there

694
00:33:09,103 --> 00:33:11,362
because it has been clearly
in the last four years

695
00:33:11,362 --> 00:33:14,930
the thing that I've seen as won and lost.

696
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,314
I would highly implore
you take the five people

697
00:33:17,314 --> 00:33:18,569
that spend the most time with you,

698
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:20,926
co-workers, or family members
if you feel like you're

699
00:33:20,926 --> 00:33:23,204
struggling with this issue
and invite them to dinner,

700
00:33:23,204 --> 00:33:25,257
create a weird event
where it's like your mom

701
00:33:25,257 --> 00:33:30,048
and a co-worker, and she'll
say what the fuck is happening,

702
00:33:30,048 --> 00:33:34,717
create a weird event and tell
everybody you really want

703
00:33:34,717 --> 00:33:36,632
to figure out what you're good
at, what you're not good at,

704
00:33:36,632 --> 00:33:38,878
and spend three hours
getting people that love you

705
00:33:38,878 --> 00:33:40,906
and know you the best
comfortable with telling you

706
00:33:40,906 --> 00:33:43,392
the truth because nobody
wants to tell you.

707
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:45,517
Because most people are
kind, we don't tell people

708
00:33:45,517 --> 00:33:47,337
because we like each other,
especially the people

709
00:33:47,337 --> 00:33:49,811
that are closest to you,
but this is something

710
00:33:49,811 --> 00:33:51,628
I threw on about a year
ago in a blog post or maybe

711
00:33:51,628 --> 00:33:53,480
two years ago and it's been
the thing that I've been

712
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,647
the most emailed about, it's remarkable.

713
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:57,761
And it's an unlock because
when you don't see it,

714
00:33:57,761 --> 00:34:00,159
when you're blinded to it,
you're doing the same repeat

715
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,818
behavior that's stopping
you from the thing

716
00:34:01,818 --> 00:34:04,023
and once you can break it,
if you have the humility

717
00:34:04,023 --> 00:34:05,925
to be comfortable with
yourself, to go there,

718
00:34:05,925 --> 00:34:09,931
it's a humongous unlock and
it's the disproportion reason.

719
00:34:09,931 --> 00:34:13,018
Listen, my friends, a lot
of people when they talk

720
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:16,847
about technology and social
media and investing in business,

721
00:34:16,848 --> 00:34:18,643
they want me to talk about details, right,

722
00:34:18,643 --> 00:34:20,840
like we're about to do
Q&A, we'll go to it now,

723
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:23,688
in two minutes, I promise,
and if you want to ask me

724
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:25,660
a simple question of how to
get more Instagram followers,

725
00:34:25,661 --> 00:34:27,818
I'm thrilled to answer
to you, I'm thrilled,

726
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:29,686
I will give you everything
I've got in detail,

727
00:34:29,686 --> 00:34:33,676
but if you ask me why I
got to sit here today,

728
00:34:33,676 --> 00:34:35,804
if you asked me why I believe
he's been able to build

729
00:34:35,804 --> 00:34:39,161
this business, my friends,
all the magic is in the gray,

730
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:40,909
it's not in the black and white.

731
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:43,068
All the tactics you can Google right now,

732
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:44,588
you can Google anything you want.

733
00:34:44,588 --> 00:34:45,915
You want to do Facebook ads better?

734
00:34:45,915 --> 00:34:48,190
It's the best deal in marketing,
you want to sell shit?

735
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,456
You Facebook advertise it.

736
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:51,277
Your company should do a
shit load more Facebook

737
00:34:51,277 --> 00:34:53,255
advertisement, I should do
more Facebook advertising,

738
00:34:53,255 --> 00:34:56,284
it's a fucking steal, it's the steal.

739
00:34:56,284 --> 00:34:57,117
Right?

740
00:34:57,118 --> 00:34:59,528
Instagram influencers, fucking steal.

741
00:34:59,528 --> 00:35:00,720
People don't know how to price themselves,

742
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,329
they give you awareness,
some are overpriced,

743
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:04,387
some are underpriced, fucking steal.

744
00:35:04,387 --> 00:35:05,264
Under 30?

745
00:35:05,264 --> 00:35:08,539
Snap-chat ads, 3$ CPMs, swipe
up, people watching videos,

746
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,834
these are details, but if
you're fucking insecure

747
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:14,578
it's not gonna mean dick.

748
00:35:14,578 --> 00:35:16,109
If you don't know what the
fuck you're doing with yourself

749
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:18,182
it's not gonna mean shit.

750
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,732
The reason I spend my
time on talking about this

751
00:35:19,732 --> 00:35:22,023
is not because I want to be a
fucking motivational speaker

752
00:35:22,023 --> 00:35:24,509
and fluffy-fluff-fluff
and ra-ra-ra, it's because

753
00:35:24,509 --> 00:35:26,687
it's the fucking thing.

754
00:35:26,687 --> 00:35:28,472
It's the thing.

755
00:35:28,472 --> 00:35:30,932
If your operating system
isn't right, you've got

756
00:35:30,932 --> 00:35:32,517
no fucking chance.

757
00:35:32,517 --> 00:35:36,005
Do you know how fucking unbeatable I feel?

758
00:35:36,005 --> 00:35:37,479
Do you know if you
think that I'm the best,

759
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:39,718
then I'm fucking the best,
and you're wearing my hoodie

760
00:35:39,718 --> 00:35:42,098
and I'm the fucking best, do
you know how good that feels?

761
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:42,931
Phenomenal.

762
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:43,850
Do you know if you're
sitting here right now,

763
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,282
never heard of me, and
you're like, fuck this guy,

764
00:35:45,282 --> 00:35:49,213
I don't like this bravado,
I don't give a fuck either.

765
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,046
I don't care if you think
I'm the best, I don't care

766
00:35:51,046 --> 00:35:52,809
if you think I'm the
worst, I'm just in my shit

767
00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:55,114
because I'm grounded,
'cause I know what I am

768
00:35:55,114 --> 00:35:57,098
and I know how I'm trying to live my life.

769
00:35:57,098 --> 00:35:59,435
And I want that for every
fucking person, because

770
00:35:59,435 --> 00:36:03,277
let me tell you something,
it fucking is the best.

771
00:36:03,277 --> 00:36:04,978
It's such a good place to be.

772
00:36:04,978 --> 00:36:06,804
Do you know what it's like
to be in your own head,

773
00:36:06,804 --> 00:36:07,723
and nothing else matters?

774
00:36:07,723 --> 00:36:10,112
Do you know what it feels
like to give a shit so much

775
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,942
about what everybody
thinks, yet not care at all?

776
00:36:12,942 --> 00:36:14,365
Do you know when I leave
here, I'm gonna look at

777
00:36:14,365 --> 00:36:16,846
every single Tweet about
this talk and if somebody

778
00:36:16,846 --> 00:36:19,404
says eh, I'm gonna be
devastated like I fucking died,

779
00:36:19,404 --> 00:36:22,071
yet I equally don't give a fuck!

780
00:36:24,798 --> 00:36:27,439
When you can get to that
place, amazing shit happens.

781
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:29,097
You know why?

782
00:36:29,097 --> 00:36:31,777
Because you stop being scared.

783
00:36:31,777 --> 00:36:34,583
When you're not scared, you do shit.

784
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:37,895
When you're scared, you do nothing.

785
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,989
And when you're not scared, you do shit,

786
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:43,348
and even better, when you're
coming from a good place,

787
00:36:43,348 --> 00:36:45,832
and your intent is good
because you're good

788
00:36:45,832 --> 00:36:49,999
and you have good to give,
shit really starts happening.

789
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:53,318
So, I implore you, let's
go, get the mics ready,

790
00:36:53,318 --> 00:36:55,299
I'm ready, let's go into the Q&A,

791
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:57,951
but I implore you, I'll
go into every detail,

792
00:36:57,951 --> 00:37:01,644
but I implore you to get
inside your head real quick,

793
00:37:01,644 --> 00:37:04,599
figure out who you really
are, and figure out if what

794
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:07,876
you're talking is being
mapped by what you're doing.

795
00:37:07,876 --> 00:37:09,783
Because the second you
put those things together,

796
00:37:09,783 --> 00:37:11,603
shit fucking unlocks.

797
00:37:11,603 --> 00:37:13,000
Thank you.

798
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
(audience cheering)

799
00:37:19,096 --> 00:37:20,216
Let's do it.

800
00:37:20,216 --> 00:37:22,008
Let's get to the good part.

801
00:37:22,008 --> 00:37:23,027
How are we doing this?

802
00:37:23,027 --> 00:37:24,303
Just line up in the rows,

803
00:37:24,303 --> 00:37:25,537
line up behind you and line up behind you?

804
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:26,491
Great, what's your name?

805
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:27,324
- [Audience Member] Hello.

806
00:37:27,324 --> 00:37:28,157
- Hello.

807
00:37:28,157 --> 00:37:28,990
- Wow, that's odd.

808
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,646
My name is Angela, I'm from Dutch Bros

809
00:37:30,646 --> 00:37:34,313
Hillsborough Cornelius,
a huge fan of yours.

810
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,074
- [Gary] Thank you, thank you.

811
00:37:37,074 --> 00:37:39,837
- Okay, so I watched tons
and tons of your content,

812
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:42,044
your videos, your daily Vs,
I listen to your podcast,

813
00:37:42,044 --> 00:37:44,804
I question that I was
thinking about for a while

814
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:48,712
is how do you as a leader
motivate your team to be just

815
00:37:48,712 --> 00:37:51,517
as hungry and passionate
as you are and make them

816
00:37:51,517 --> 00:37:53,178
want to bust their ass just as hard?

817
00:37:53,178 --> 00:37:54,790
- I don't.

818
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:57,892
I think it's crazy for CEOs
and owners of things to

819
00:37:57,892 --> 00:38:01,269
expect their staff to bust
their ass and be as hungry

820
00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:03,726
as them because when you own something,

821
00:38:03,726 --> 00:38:05,098
it's different.

822
00:38:05,098 --> 00:38:07,340
And so, what I do, is I try to motivate

823
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:10,396
by meeting each and every one of them.

824
00:38:10,396 --> 00:38:12,556
The reason you've seen it,
that I meet with all of them

825
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:16,662
and do those meetings, I want
to buy the New York Jets,

826
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:19,952
I need like seven billion fucking dollars,

827
00:38:19,952 --> 00:38:23,267
I work 18 hours a day, I wake up at 4.30

828
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:25,282
to be here today, I'm going back.

829
00:38:25,282 --> 00:38:27,181
This was originally, I was
supposed to sleep here,

830
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:29,310
no, I need to get three
meetings in tomorrow,

831
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,511
I'm taking a bullshit red-eye tonight,

832
00:38:31,511 --> 00:38:33,781
I don't expect that from others,

833
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:35,796
because most people
aren't insane to have this

834
00:38:35,796 --> 00:38:38,176
romantic point of view
of not being able to buy

835
00:38:38,176 --> 00:38:40,218
a Jets jersey for 20 bucks
when he first came to America,

836
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:41,431
to owning the team.

837
00:38:41,431 --> 00:38:43,708
I've got a fuck you, on me, got it?

838
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:46,290
I don't expect that for anybody else.

839
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,817
What I want to know is what
makes every one of them tick.

840
00:38:49,817 --> 00:38:51,642
Do you know how many people
just want to make 200,000

841
00:38:51,642 --> 00:38:53,737
a year and have great work-life balance?

842
00:38:53,737 --> 00:38:55,283
That's fucking
unbelievable, that's fucking

843
00:38:55,283 --> 00:38:56,116
hitting the luck.

844
00:38:56,116 --> 00:38:58,508
If you are the kind of
person that is obsessed with

845
00:38:58,508 --> 00:39:00,815
making $200,000 a year,
and being able to go to all

846
00:39:00,815 --> 00:39:03,069
sporting events of your
wonderful children,

847
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:05,424
that's incredible balance
and if that's what you want,

848
00:39:05,424 --> 00:39:07,885
I want to empower you to do that.

849
00:39:07,885 --> 00:39:09,949
I think the biggest mistake
the leaders make is they

850
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:13,427
expect others to care about
their shit as much as they do,

851
00:39:13,427 --> 00:39:14,849
that's fucking ludicrous.

852
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:16,285
I want to figure out what you care about

853
00:39:16,285 --> 00:39:19,586
and it's my job to put you
in a position to succeed,

854
00:39:19,586 --> 00:39:21,987
to be hungry, and if that
means seeing every fucking

855
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:24,309
recital of your little
Suzy, I'm gonna fucking

856
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:25,642
do that for you.

857
00:39:34,525 --> 00:39:35,358
- [Audience Member] What up, G?

858
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:36,191
- How are you, bro?

859
00:39:36,191 --> 00:39:37,024
- [Audience Member] Good man.

860
00:39:37,024 --> 00:39:40,869
I'm Logan, I work for
West Vancouver franchise.

861
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:42,766
- Oh, is this the thing we
do, you say where you're from

862
00:39:42,766 --> 00:39:44,329
and then your four people are like, yeah,

863
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:45,855
what up, motherfucker, what's up!

864
00:39:45,855 --> 00:39:48,083
I got it, I got it, just
trying to get it down,

865
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:49,700
I got it now.

866
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,588
- They're my groupies.

867
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:54,345
- [Gary] You all from VaynerMedia
New York, give me some!

868
00:39:54,345 --> 00:39:56,012
All right, go ahead.

869
00:39:57,265 --> 00:39:59,263
- One thing I've learned
from working with the company

870
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:01,220
for so long and stuff is the passion.

871
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,618
Everybody here has passion.

872
00:40:02,618 --> 00:40:03,451
- [Gary] Clearly.

873
00:40:03,451 --> 00:40:05,932
- And we give so much.

874
00:40:05,932 --> 00:40:08,256
I mean it could be passion with our job,

875
00:40:08,256 --> 00:40:10,105
it could passion from outside, it could be

876
00:40:10,105 --> 00:40:11,598
whatever it is.

877
00:40:11,598 --> 00:40:13,450
- You guys are so ridiculously lucky,

878
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:17,617
we've an internal job board,
I have full-time employees

879
00:40:18,573 --> 00:40:22,098
trying to help people get
jobs to leave our company

880
00:40:22,098 --> 00:40:23,391
'cause we want it better for them,

881
00:40:23,391 --> 00:40:26,414
I've literally never sensed a truer purity

882
00:40:26,414 --> 00:40:29,284
of that mission as much
as you guys have as well

883
00:40:29,284 --> 00:40:30,263
and it's remarkable.

884
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:31,658
You guys are very fortunate.

885
00:40:31,658 --> 00:40:35,586
It stems from the top and
like-minded people find each

886
00:40:35,586 --> 00:40:37,776
other, it's really rad,
I'm really impressed,

887
00:40:37,776 --> 00:40:40,060
I'm super-pumped to be here, go ahead.

888
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,727
- Basically my question is,
do you ever hold back any

889
00:40:43,727 --> 00:40:46,444
of your passion, does it ever
maybe get the best of you

890
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,586
sometimes and that you
have to maybe take a couple

891
00:40:48,586 --> 00:40:53,253
of steps back and realize,
I may have gone too far.

892
00:40:53,253 --> 00:40:54,836
- The answer is no.

893
00:40:56,152 --> 00:41:00,541
But, more importantly,
for me it's kind of like,

894
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,462
I do lots of things out of
passion that I'm not pumped

895
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,934
about, for example, let's
go back to football,

896
00:41:05,934 --> 00:41:09,184
two years ago, at a Jets-Steelers game,

897
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,252
Jets were beating the
Steelers, this was four years

898
00:41:14,252 --> 00:41:15,831
ago, for no reason,
Steelers were much better,

899
00:41:15,831 --> 00:41:18,025
Jets were bad that year, Jets
are on the verge of winning,

900
00:41:18,025 --> 00:41:21,151
this 85-year-old guy is
coming up the stairs,

901
00:41:21,151 --> 00:41:24,842
and I get sports muscles,
when I'm in Jets world,

902
00:41:24,842 --> 00:41:27,547
I'm not me, it's the
only place I'm not me.

903
00:41:27,547 --> 00:41:29,500
I get too emotional, right?

904
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,579
So, the guy is walking up
and the Jets are winning,

905
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:33,546
it's the fourth quarter
and I stand up 'cause I'm

906
00:41:33,546 --> 00:41:37,688
ridiculous and I'm like, hey,
old man, you're finished,

907
00:41:37,688 --> 00:41:40,211
old man, you're finished, right?

908
00:41:40,211 --> 00:41:41,540
And everybody is kind of
looking at me because it was

909
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,740
super-inappropriate and then I go,

910
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,907
and I don't mean the game.

911
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,693
Right.

912
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:51,743
So, my passion went too far there.

913
00:41:53,006 --> 00:41:54,423
So, I understand.

914
00:41:55,438 --> 00:41:56,697
I get it.

915
00:41:56,697 --> 00:41:59,715
I guess, first of all I just
wanted to tell you that story

916
00:41:59,715 --> 00:42:02,599
because it's so fucked up.

917
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:04,179
I needed to get it out
of me, it's so horrible,

918
00:42:04,179 --> 00:42:05,394
I'm glad I was able to share it,

919
00:42:05,394 --> 00:42:06,894
I feel better now.

920
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,473
- I guess this is more
like, maybe I feel like

921
00:42:11,473 --> 00:42:14,420
sometimes when I give off my passion--

922
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,437
- [Gary] It makes people creep out?

923
00:42:15,437 --> 00:42:16,705
- Kind of, yeah.

924
00:42:16,705 --> 00:42:19,047
People basically get
scared the shit out of them

925
00:42:19,047 --> 00:42:21,003
just because I did so much--

926
00:42:21,003 --> 00:42:22,768
- Bro, honestly, as long
as you're coming from

927
00:42:22,768 --> 00:42:24,699
a good place, I did the
same thing, I curse,

928
00:42:24,699 --> 00:42:27,144
but I'm coming from such a good place,

929
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:29,440
that I'm not trying to
impose any negativity,

930
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,125
as long as your passion is
coming from a good place

931
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:33,503
and it's not a shtick 'cause
you think it's helping you

932
00:42:33,503 --> 00:42:35,714
and it's an act, and it's
not trying to do something

933
00:42:35,714 --> 00:42:37,704
that's bad for them, you're fucking good.

934
00:42:37,704 --> 00:42:40,263
Let the chips fall, you
know what I'm saying?

935
00:42:40,263 --> 00:42:42,099
This is back to self-awareness.

936
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:44,312
You got to ask yourself two
very important questions,

937
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,555
number one, is it a shtick?

938
00:42:46,555 --> 00:42:48,430
Are you doing it 'cause it's self-interest

939
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,966
and it's a narrative you're trying to pave

940
00:42:49,966 --> 00:42:51,794
to do something selfish for you?

941
00:42:51,794 --> 00:42:54,341
Number two, are you doing
it to suppress somebody

942
00:42:54,341 --> 00:42:56,432
because you're insecure about their skills

943
00:42:56,432 --> 00:42:58,573
that you don't have, as
long as it's neither one

944
00:42:58,573 --> 00:43:01,807
of those two, fucking be
as passionate as you want.

945
00:43:01,807 --> 00:43:02,640
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

946
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,057
- You're welcome.

947
00:43:07,098 --> 00:43:07,931
Wow, yes.

948
00:43:09,158 --> 00:43:09,991
- [Audience Member] Hi, Gary.

949
00:43:09,991 --> 00:43:10,824
- Hi.

950
00:43:10,824 --> 00:43:11,898
- I'm Erika, nice to meet you.

951
00:43:11,898 --> 00:43:12,850
- [Gary] Nice to meet you, Erika.

952
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:16,902
- I run the social media pages
for the Spoke and Dutch Bros.

953
00:43:16,902 --> 00:43:17,950
- [Gary] All 10?

954
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:18,783
- Yeah.

955
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:24,602
So, six months ago, I
was at an agency, running

956
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,866
their social media
department, I was miserable.

957
00:43:27,866 --> 00:43:30,515
Not my kind of humans, just not my place,

958
00:43:30,515 --> 00:43:32,175
I watched your videos for about a year,

959
00:43:32,175 --> 00:43:34,387
telling me to hustle, telling me to do it,

960
00:43:34,387 --> 00:43:37,397
just work hard, so I quit
my job, I started my own

961
00:43:37,397 --> 00:43:40,191
social media company and I feel blessed,

962
00:43:40,191 --> 00:43:42,986
but in three months I've doubled my salary

963
00:43:42,986 --> 00:43:46,322
and it's really taken off, a
lot to do with these people,

964
00:43:46,322 --> 00:43:49,847
but, so my next question
for you is how do I go

965
00:43:49,847 --> 00:43:52,087
to the next step, you know
I've got this small business,

966
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:54,693
I'm hustling, working 12
hours a day, how do I get

967
00:43:54,693 --> 00:43:55,776
to 800 staff?

968
00:43:57,071 --> 00:43:57,904
- [Gary] Is that what you want?

969
00:43:57,904 --> 00:44:01,419
- Yeah, I picture, my company
is called Talk Fast Social,

970
00:44:01,419 --> 00:44:04,633
I picture a TFS on a building every day

971
00:44:04,633 --> 00:44:05,670
and I work for it.

972
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:07,010
- [Gary] Love it, so how old are you?

973
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,108
- I'm 26.

974
00:44:08,108 --> 00:44:10,112
- Good, all right, step number one.

975
00:44:10,112 --> 00:44:12,798
The next 10 years of your
life you have to close your

976
00:44:12,798 --> 00:44:15,202
eyes and think about nothing else.

977
00:44:15,202 --> 00:44:17,677
Now, that doesn't mean
you can't find love,

978
00:44:17,677 --> 00:44:19,368
it doesn't mean you can't do other things,

979
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:21,608
but the only way you can build something

980
00:44:21,608 --> 00:44:26,120
very, very, very big is
you put those on a building

981
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,673
and you put in the back of your mind

982
00:44:27,673 --> 00:44:29,401
and you close your eyes.

983
00:44:29,401 --> 00:44:32,693
The biggest reason almost
everybody fails in their

984
00:44:32,693 --> 00:44:35,471
big ambitions is 'cause
of lack of patience.

985
00:44:35,471 --> 00:44:37,117
You know I talk about this all the time.

986
00:44:37,117 --> 00:44:40,575
People struggle because what they do is,

987
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,965
they get a little success
and they start getting

988
00:44:42,965 --> 00:44:45,493
greedy in a good way, I'm
using it as a slang term for,

989
00:44:45,493 --> 00:44:47,898
okay, you've got a little
momentum, you're like,

990
00:44:47,898 --> 00:44:50,931
wait a minute, fuck, I can
do this and then people

991
00:44:50,931 --> 00:44:54,030
start getting greedy and
they over-extend themselves

992
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:56,633
because they're rushing so fast.

993
00:44:56,633 --> 00:44:59,636
People literally say things to
me, I got to do five million

994
00:44:59,636 --> 00:45:01,525
or I got to put my name on a building.

995
00:45:01,525 --> 00:45:04,243
They make up these things,
like the Jets thing,

996
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,033
the Jets thing is not even real for me.

997
00:45:06,033 --> 00:45:07,924
I've talked about it a little bit.

998
00:45:07,924 --> 00:45:10,354
I desperately want to buy
the Jets because I think

999
00:45:10,354 --> 00:45:11,890
I'm more likely to win
a Superbowl for them

1000
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:16,057
than any other way, but the
chase of trying to buy them

1001
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,990
is what gets me off, not getting it.

1002
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:24,688
I've forever in my have
never needed anything.

1003
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:28,170
Not a certain dollar amount,
not some vision of a building,

1004
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:31,973
you know what I mean,
I'm just telling you it's

1005
00:45:31,973 --> 00:45:34,526
one step in front of the other, patience

1006
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:36,346
and doing tried and true things.

1007
00:45:36,346 --> 00:45:38,846
I leave money on the
table at extreme levels

1008
00:45:38,846 --> 00:45:41,718
every year because I'm
being patient, I'm building

1009
00:45:41,718 --> 00:45:44,500
real legacy and real
relationship step by step,

1010
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,857
by step, by step, you just
got to close your fucking

1011
00:45:46,857 --> 00:45:48,396
eyes for the next decade.

1012
00:45:48,396 --> 00:45:49,229
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

1013
00:45:49,229 --> 00:45:50,646
- You're welcome.

1014
00:45:52,464 --> 00:45:53,297
- [Audience Member] Hey.

1015
00:45:53,297 --> 00:45:54,130
- Hey.

1016
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:54,965
- [Audience Member] I'm Gamby.

1017
00:45:54,965 --> 00:45:55,798
- How are you?

1018
00:45:55,798 --> 00:45:56,801
- I'm great, how are you?

1019
00:45:56,801 --> 00:45:57,634
- [Gary] Great.

1020
00:45:57,634 --> 00:46:02,278
- Good, I'm from Chico,
there's like six of us.

1021
00:46:02,278 --> 00:46:05,988
- [Gary] That dude like
yawned, he's like, yeah.

1022
00:46:05,988 --> 00:46:07,423
Go ahead.

1023
00:46:07,423 --> 00:46:11,121
- So you have a chief hiring
officer at Vayner Media,

1024
00:46:11,121 --> 00:46:11,954
right?

1025
00:46:11,954 --> 00:46:12,787
- [Gary] Yes.

1026
00:46:12,787 --> 00:46:16,680
- So, when you bring her on,
what's that discussion like

1027
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,526
when you talk about her
objectives, do you have

1028
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:23,469
KPIs, things that are
available, are there incentives,

1029
00:46:23,469 --> 00:46:25,731
how much detail can you
go into and obviously

1030
00:46:25,731 --> 00:46:27,449
you don't have to tell
me how much she makes,

1031
00:46:27,449 --> 00:46:29,659
stuff like that, but whatever,
how much can you tell me

1032
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:33,382
about how to make it
something that's as objective

1033
00:46:33,382 --> 00:46:36,345
as possible for someone
like that to be successful

1034
00:46:36,345 --> 00:46:38,063
with what you put in front of them?

1035
00:46:38,063 --> 00:46:40,857
- So, first of all, it's a great question,

1036
00:46:40,857 --> 00:46:43,401
and asking about the
black and white around it

1037
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:45,675
is super-interesting to
me because it's the most

1038
00:46:45,675 --> 00:46:48,509
gray role in our organization, right?

1039
00:46:48,509 --> 00:46:51,115
So, for example, lifetime
retention of employees

1040
00:46:51,115 --> 00:46:53,800
is not a KPI because if we think Karen,

1041
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,947
I mean, like the young woman we just met,

1042
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:59,282
we may encourage her to
start her own company,

1043
00:46:59,282 --> 00:47:01,899
I'm trying to push six or
seven of my best people out,

1044
00:47:01,899 --> 00:47:04,020
like you need to start your
own company because we're

1045
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,967
gonna have a problem in
three years because you're

1046
00:47:05,967 --> 00:47:09,423
such an A and you just
need to scratch this itch.

1047
00:47:09,423 --> 00:47:12,202
So, I'll be honest with
you, I micro-manage HR

1048
00:47:12,202 --> 00:47:15,958
for 20 years that I ran my
company, my entire life,

1049
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,165
until I found a soulmate
in Claude who literally

1050
00:47:19,165 --> 00:47:21,286
looked at all the situations the same,

1051
00:47:21,286 --> 00:47:23,672
and she was on the account
side and then she left

1052
00:47:23,672 --> 00:47:26,413
Vayner and I courted her to
come back to do a totally

1053
00:47:26,413 --> 00:47:29,529
different role because
the truth is, the KPI

1054
00:47:29,529 --> 00:47:33,928
is how do you keep 800 people,
1500 people, 4000 people

1055
00:47:33,928 --> 00:47:38,399
happy with the machine, and
by the way, it's impossible.

1056
00:47:38,399 --> 00:47:40,770
The level of cynicism
that is in our society

1057
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,226
is extraordinary.

1058
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:44,846
It's so hard to prove to
somebody that you care,

1059
00:47:44,846 --> 00:47:47,494
everybody is so scared to
trust because they don't

1060
00:47:47,494 --> 00:47:49,947
want to get hurt, that
it's easier to be cynical.

1061
00:47:49,947 --> 00:47:52,254
I understand, but all that Claude may do,

1062
00:47:52,254 --> 00:47:55,440
the whole flight here, we
text about individual people,

1063
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,079
I know exactly what's going on right now

1064
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:00,139
with Kristsuz Valdi,
right, and exactly what's

1065
00:48:00,139 --> 00:48:02,937
going to happen with Joe
Catrone and why we've

1066
00:48:02,937 --> 00:48:05,065
moved Natalie Karie into a different pot,

1067
00:48:05,065 --> 00:48:09,232
I'm so fucking in it, but
we have lightweight KPIs,

1068
00:48:10,425 --> 00:48:13,263
but Claude and I are outside the lines.

1069
00:48:13,263 --> 00:48:16,560
We surround ourselves with
people making sure all the things

1070
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,554
that are black and white, simple things,

1071
00:48:19,554 --> 00:48:21,465
like people getting raises
appropriately at the time

1072
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:22,439
they're promised.

1073
00:48:22,439 --> 00:48:26,780
Not just silly shit that, we've
got the special part down,

1074
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,856
we surround ourselves to
make sure we don't drop

1075
00:48:28,856 --> 00:48:31,176
the ball on the commodity, the key is,

1076
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:32,918
how the fuck do we get
everybody to feel good

1077
00:48:32,918 --> 00:48:35,083
every day, right?

1078
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:36,698
That they know that we've got their back

1079
00:48:36,698 --> 00:48:39,275
whether they work with
us for one more day.

1080
00:48:39,275 --> 00:48:41,431
Every time that somebody
quits in a weird way,

1081
00:48:41,431 --> 00:48:43,906
I always grab them,
always, I'm like, dude,

1082
00:48:43,906 --> 00:48:46,758
what the fuck, man, I put
out content every day,

1083
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:50,691
I've told you, I emailed
you, why didn't you use me

1084
00:48:50,691 --> 00:48:53,352
if you were so unhappy, I
could've gotten you a job,

1085
00:48:53,352 --> 00:48:57,565
the other way, like I
thought I was underpaid,

1086
00:48:57,565 --> 00:49:00,046
I'm like, dude, you've got $11,000 pay up,

1087
00:49:00,046 --> 00:49:01,479
A, I would've been
thrilled to give it to you,

1088
00:49:01,479 --> 00:49:04,740
but way more importantly,
there's 11 people like you

1089
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,991
that I'm friends with
right now, let me help you.

1090
00:49:07,991 --> 00:49:11,505
Basically what I'm trying
to do is build real trust

1091
00:49:11,505 --> 00:49:14,327
through scaling the unscalable.

1092
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:17,148
One-on-one conversations, the problem is,

1093
00:49:17,148 --> 00:49:19,867
that we're learning, at
first it worked unbelievably,

1094
00:49:19,867 --> 00:49:22,699
but now she becomes too much of a machine,

1095
00:49:22,699 --> 00:49:25,423
so it's me and her, now
we're like the parents

1096
00:49:25,423 --> 00:49:27,839
or the siblings, so you got
to bring in other things,

1097
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,344
I used to have an open-door
policy, not working.

1098
00:49:30,344 --> 00:49:34,387
2018, mandated 15 minutes
with every fucking employee

1099
00:49:34,387 --> 00:49:36,793
I have twice a year.

1100
00:49:36,793 --> 00:49:39,604
Mandated, it's gonna take
me enormous amounts of time,

1101
00:49:39,604 --> 00:49:42,271
I don't care, it's all I've got.

1102
00:49:43,677 --> 00:49:48,068
Religion, you know, I don't
care what the church or the

1103
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:50,577
synagogue, or the temple
or the mosque is decorated

1104
00:49:50,577 --> 00:49:53,325
like, I care about the
religion and too many people

1105
00:49:53,325 --> 00:49:54,773
care about, you know.

1106
00:49:54,773 --> 00:49:56,726
She makes hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of thousands

1107
00:49:56,726 --> 00:49:59,844
of dollars, nobody is bonus
at Vayner Media because

1108
00:49:59,844 --> 00:50:02,048
I want everybody to be
obsessed with the logo,

1109
00:50:02,048 --> 00:50:04,258
and so when people talk to
me about their incentive

1110
00:50:04,258 --> 00:50:05,971
packages or things of that
nature, I just match it

1111
00:50:05,971 --> 00:50:07,333
and put it into their salary.

1112
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:09,963
Some people go, well, then
they're de-incentivized.

1113
00:50:09,963 --> 00:50:11,601
No, they're not, if you
don't fucking achieve,

1114
00:50:11,601 --> 00:50:13,768
we fire your fucking face.

1115
00:50:15,771 --> 00:50:16,604
Cool.

1116
00:50:18,468 --> 00:50:19,362
- [Audience Member] Hey, what's up, Gary?

1117
00:50:19,362 --> 00:50:20,195
- How are you?

1118
00:50:20,195 --> 00:50:21,028
- [Audience Member] Good, how are you?

1119
00:50:21,028 --> 00:50:21,861
- Amazing.

1120
00:50:21,861 --> 00:50:24,221
- My name is Mick, I'm
with these lovely people

1121
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:27,232
from around California right here.

1122
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,053
- [Gary] I saw that move, I saw that move.

1123
00:50:29,053 --> 00:50:33,220
- So, I took over managing
in my stand earlier this year

1124
00:50:34,568 --> 00:50:36,372
and one of the more interesting things,

1125
00:50:36,372 --> 00:50:40,788
challenges that I've come
across is identifying

1126
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:44,929
qualities in people that
I think would translate

1127
00:50:44,929 --> 00:50:48,059
well into them moving into leadership

1128
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:49,104
and management.

1129
00:50:49,104 --> 00:50:51,804
So I was curious for you
if you have someone in your

1130
00:50:51,804 --> 00:50:53,846
company who you're looking
at to put in leadership

1131
00:50:53,846 --> 00:50:55,852
or management, what are
some of the most important

1132
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:57,667
qualities that you look for?

1133
00:50:57,667 --> 00:50:58,500
- Empathy.

1134
00:51:01,272 --> 00:51:05,727
Empathy is fucking disproportionately
important for leaders,

1135
00:51:05,727 --> 00:51:07,808
if you are not capable of
thinking about the other

1136
00:51:07,808 --> 00:51:10,391
person first, you are finished.

1137
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:17,471
Empathy, work ethic, I
think work ethic matters,

1138
00:51:17,471 --> 00:51:19,244
it's tough, right, because
if you're not working

1139
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:21,751
as hard as your team or
harder, that starts becoming

1140
00:51:21,751 --> 00:51:24,577
the vulnerability,
gratitude is one that I look

1141
00:51:24,577 --> 00:51:26,434
for quite a bit, are
they actually grateful

1142
00:51:26,434 --> 00:51:28,049
or are they entitled and
think, of course I'm gonna

1143
00:51:28,049 --> 00:51:29,021
be a manger.

1144
00:51:29,021 --> 00:51:32,745
But empathy is fucking 80%
of it and then the other

1145
00:51:32,745 --> 00:51:36,849
20% is work ethic,
gratitude, things like that.

1146
00:51:36,849 --> 00:51:38,266
Yeah, you got it.

1147
00:51:41,211 --> 00:51:42,044
- [Rich] What's up, Gary?

1148
00:51:42,044 --> 00:51:42,877
- Hey, bro.

1149
00:51:42,877 --> 00:51:45,959
- I'm Vince, and I guess
I'm here with everybody

1150
00:51:45,959 --> 00:51:50,126
because I think we're all
here for the same reason.

1151
00:51:50,965 --> 00:51:54,256
Also, this adrenaline rush
is like the best adrenaline

1152
00:51:54,256 --> 00:51:58,803
rush I've gotten since
high-school, so thanks, man!

1153
00:51:58,803 --> 00:52:01,060
- [Gary] Real quick, paint me the picture

1154
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,638
of what was happening in
high-school when you felt this.

1155
00:52:03,638 --> 00:52:07,638
- Honestly, I'd say it
was like my last home-run

1156
00:52:11,741 --> 00:52:13,518
when I was playing baseball.

1157
00:52:13,518 --> 00:52:14,965
- [Gary] Respect.

1158
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,410
That's not what we thought.

1159
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:19,243
All right, keep going.

1160
00:52:20,358 --> 00:52:22,143
- So, my question for
you, you talk about the

1161
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,616
seven to two.

1162
00:52:23,616 --> 00:52:25,931
- [Gary] 7 p.m to two in the morning.

1163
00:52:25,931 --> 00:52:27,552
- And I just kind of want
to know because I know

1164
00:52:27,552 --> 00:52:31,070
you're trying to be that
Jets owner, by the way,

1165
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:33,397
William Johnson doesn't have shit on you.

1166
00:52:33,397 --> 00:52:35,082
- [Gary] That's for damn sure.

1167
00:52:35,082 --> 00:52:37,342
- I just want to know
what's your side hustle

1168
00:52:37,342 --> 00:52:39,371
looking like right now because obviously

1169
00:52:39,371 --> 00:52:40,988
if you want to get to that,

1170
00:52:40,988 --> 00:52:42,771
what steps are you taking?

1171
00:52:42,771 --> 00:52:44,541
- So, when I talk about side hustle,

1172
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:47,023
I talk about either
really wanting something

1173
00:52:47,023 --> 00:52:48,568
that you don't have
right now or getting out

1174
00:52:48,568 --> 00:52:50,199
of a bad situations.

1175
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:53,159
I'm so in my zone, my
side hustle is my hustle,

1176
00:52:53,159 --> 00:52:58,080
I'm working 7 a.m to 10,
11, I don't think I've been

1177
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,951
home before 10.30 in the last three years,

1178
00:53:01,951 --> 00:53:03,352
on a week day.

1179
00:53:03,352 --> 00:53:06,402
My work life balance is
in the extremes, I take

1180
00:53:06,402 --> 00:53:09,023
seven weeks' vacation, I
have the weekends, but Monday

1181
00:53:09,023 --> 00:53:11,569
through Friday, I don't even see my kids.

1182
00:53:11,569 --> 00:53:13,774
That's just how my wife and
I, we're comfortable with,

1183
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,475
that's my reality.

1184
00:53:15,475 --> 00:53:18,146
So I don't have that, I
would say my side hustle

1185
00:53:18,146 --> 00:53:21,265
is probably Gary V, I'm
spending all my time

1186
00:53:21,265 --> 00:53:23,746
being the CEO of Vayner Media,
but because of the concept

1187
00:53:23,746 --> 00:53:26,723
that D. Rock and I and
my team have figured out,

1188
00:53:26,723 --> 00:53:30,037
it feels like I'm me out
and about, but it's because

1189
00:53:30,037 --> 00:53:33,752
I only show, and I only
talk 30 times a year.

1190
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:37,884
I'm able to create so much
content, so I think my side

1191
00:53:37,884 --> 00:53:40,681
hustle is Gary V, because
I enjoy this so much,

1192
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:43,181
I enjoy jamming with you guys.

1193
00:53:44,066 --> 00:53:48,003
Bro, if I could make you
guys feel what I felt like

1194
00:53:48,003 --> 00:53:50,132
when I heard that young woman say to me,

1195
00:53:50,132 --> 00:53:52,728
I was in a job and I watched
your shit for a year,

1196
00:53:52,728 --> 00:53:55,801
you pumped me up, gave me
the courage, let's call

1197
00:53:55,801 --> 00:53:58,333
it what it is, to make
that leap, and now I'm

1198
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:01,075
doing twice as good and do
you know what it feels like

1199
00:54:01,075 --> 00:54:02,492
to impact people?

1200
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,340
It's knarly.

1201
00:54:06,032 --> 00:54:09,615
So, that's my side
hustle, thanks, brother.

1202
00:54:11,301 --> 00:54:12,672
All right, yes?

1203
00:54:12,672 --> 00:54:13,505
- [Audience Member] What's up, Gary?

1204
00:54:13,505 --> 00:54:14,338
- [Gary] How are you doing?

1205
00:54:14,338 --> 00:54:18,374
- Doing good, name's Kyle, East Vancouver.

1206
00:54:18,374 --> 00:54:19,592
- [Gary] East Vancouver.

1207
00:54:19,592 --> 00:54:21,259
- Nicely done, guys.

1208
00:54:22,978 --> 00:54:24,385
Yeah, I don't affiliate with any gangs.

1209
00:54:24,385 --> 00:54:26,930
- [Gary] Respect, huge
mistake, keep going.

1210
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:27,882
- I appreciate that.

1211
00:54:27,882 --> 00:54:30,212
So, for one, I know there are kids here,

1212
00:54:30,212 --> 00:54:31,885
but holy fucking shit, nice job.

1213
00:54:31,885 --> 00:54:32,718
- [Gary] Thank you.

1214
00:54:32,718 --> 00:54:34,390
- That was pretty impressive.

1215
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:37,013
I listen to you for hours,
I tried audio books,

1216
00:54:37,013 --> 00:54:38,904
and I fall asleep to your
voice because it's pretty

1217
00:54:38,904 --> 00:54:39,907
fucking--

1218
00:54:39,907 --> 00:54:42,107
- [Gary] Done bro, done.

1219
00:54:42,107 --> 00:54:45,000
- So, actually I'm standing
here still scared shitless,

1220
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,817
and that's kind of the
transition, so with these

1221
00:54:49,817 --> 00:54:52,504
moments in time, these
monumental steps that you want

1222
00:54:52,504 --> 00:54:55,705
to take towards success, I
know how you're talking about

1223
00:54:55,705 --> 00:54:58,811
being unbeatable in your own
head, reaching that status

1224
00:54:58,811 --> 00:55:01,061
of your own self-awareness,

1225
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:05,008
just kind of like with the basics,

1226
00:55:05,008 --> 00:55:07,544
what would be your tactics for--

1227
00:55:07,544 --> 00:55:08,992
- [Gary] To get to that place?

1228
00:55:08,992 --> 00:55:09,825
- Yeah.

1229
00:55:09,825 --> 00:55:12,174
- Step number one, more than
anything, I alluded to when

1230
00:55:12,174 --> 00:55:14,060
I talked, but this is
why I love Q&A, you have

1231
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:17,593
to figure out whose opinion
is dictating your actions

1232
00:55:17,593 --> 00:55:19,682
beside yourself.

1233
00:55:19,682 --> 00:55:22,296
You have to figure out who has say,

1234
00:55:22,296 --> 00:55:23,895
let's keep it on him right
now because this is gonna

1235
00:55:23,895 --> 00:55:25,223
matter for a lot of people.

1236
00:55:25,223 --> 00:55:27,082
Let's actually play through
this, who in your life

1237
00:55:27,082 --> 00:55:30,963
has say when you do shit, who factors in,

1238
00:55:30,963 --> 00:55:35,398
who runs through your mind,
who are you curious about,

1239
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:37,360
about how they would react or think?

1240
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,172
Who are those people?

1241
00:55:39,172 --> 00:55:41,920
- Honestly, that would
probably be like, actually

1242
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,284
Pierce right here, Pierce,
if you saw the viral video,

1243
00:55:45,284 --> 00:55:48,371
or I saw, viral picture, he
was the one that was pranked,

1244
00:55:48,371 --> 00:55:49,518
he's a very good friend of mine.

1245
00:55:49,518 --> 00:55:51,169
- [Gary] So, Pierce's
opinion matters, good,

1246
00:55:51,169 --> 00:55:52,177
and who else?

1247
00:55:52,177 --> 00:55:54,575
- My girlfriend and my
parents and my sister.

1248
00:55:54,575 --> 00:55:55,408
- Great.

1249
00:55:55,408 --> 00:55:58,529
You need to get into a
place where you respect

1250
00:55:58,529 --> 00:56:01,145
Pierce, girlfriend,
parents, you love Pierce,

1251
00:56:01,145 --> 00:56:03,472
girlfriend, parents,
you'll do anything for

1252
00:56:03,472 --> 00:56:07,141
Pierce, girlfriend,
parents, but you get into

1253
00:56:07,141 --> 00:56:08,888
a place where you don't give a fuck about

1254
00:56:08,888 --> 00:56:11,326
Pierce, girlfriend, and parents.

1255
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:15,493
And listen, it's pulling so
hard from opposite directions,

1256
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:20,898
like, I want to stay on this
because this will really

1257
00:56:20,898 --> 00:56:21,905
be a big unlock.

1258
00:56:21,905 --> 00:56:25,400
If I can get one person to
shift a hair, it's huge.

1259
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,133
It's crazy to me how much
I care about everybody's

1260
00:56:29,133 --> 00:56:30,993
opinion, like these two
people in the fourth row

1261
00:56:30,993 --> 00:56:34,361
have hoodies with my
quotes on, I care so much

1262
00:56:34,361 --> 00:56:37,004
about what they think about
me, you would not believe,

1263
00:56:37,004 --> 00:56:41,603
while equally really giving
no shit about what they think.

1264
00:56:41,603 --> 00:56:45,520
And it's about this crazy
balance, I never let

1265
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:49,687
somebody else's opinion matter
more than mine of myself.

1266
00:56:50,832 --> 00:56:54,409
You know, there's just
nothing you can say,

1267
00:56:54,409 --> 00:56:56,920
from people that know me the best, my mom,

1268
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:00,657
there's nothing you're gonna
be able to say about me

1269
00:57:00,657 --> 00:57:03,792
that makes me not realize,
of course you think that,

1270
00:57:03,792 --> 00:57:06,427
you don't really know me
and that goes all the way

1271
00:57:06,427 --> 00:57:08,249
to my mom, right?

1272
00:57:08,249 --> 00:57:11,497
You know what you've seen,
I know why you think that

1273
00:57:11,497 --> 00:57:13,829
if that's the only piece of
content you've ever consumed

1274
00:57:13,829 --> 00:57:16,739
from me, this is where
I'm a different version,

1275
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:20,239
I get it, I get it, I'm empathetic to why,

1276
00:57:22,091 --> 00:57:25,682
but the way to get there
man, is very simply,

1277
00:57:25,682 --> 00:57:26,515
you first.

1278
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,522
It's so weird to say
do everything you think

1279
00:57:31,522 --> 00:57:34,772
you should do, but that's what I do.

1280
00:57:34,772 --> 00:57:36,698
And I think maybe for me it's easy because

1281
00:57:36,698 --> 00:57:39,324
somewhere along the line
I figured out that I can

1282
00:57:39,324 --> 00:57:42,238
get everything that I
wanted for myself by myself,

1283
00:57:42,238 --> 00:57:45,046
so I don't need anybody,
which is a really important

1284
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:47,561
thing, to be in that place
where you know that you don't

1285
00:57:47,561 --> 00:57:50,314
need anybody emotionally
or financially, it's just

1286
00:57:50,314 --> 00:57:53,647
a very lonely and very not-lonely place.

1287
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:57,583
So, it's hard, honestly,
I wish I could give,

1288
00:57:57,583 --> 00:58:00,918
like fuck, man, I think I'm
trying so hard to put out

1289
00:58:00,918 --> 00:58:03,047
so much content because it's
the closest way I'll ever

1290
00:58:03,047 --> 00:58:05,765
get to giving it, I wish I could give it,

1291
00:58:05,765 --> 00:58:10,103
because it's fucking,
so peaceful, you know?

1292
00:58:10,103 --> 00:58:10,936
- Much appreciated, man.

1293
00:58:10,936 --> 00:58:12,019
- You got it.

1294
00:58:14,608 --> 00:58:16,199
I can keep going, right?

1295
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:18,675
I'm in great shape, right?

1296
00:58:18,675 --> 00:58:20,520
Cool, fuck it.

1297
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,881
- [Audience Member] You can
go as long as you want, Gary.

1298
00:58:21,881 --> 00:58:23,748
- I really want to go long.

1299
00:58:23,748 --> 00:58:24,652
You guys want to keep doing this?

1300
00:58:24,652 --> 00:58:26,241
- [Audience] Yeah!

1301
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:27,464
- Let's go.

1302
00:58:27,464 --> 00:58:29,074
- Thanks for being here and
setting a bunch of fires

1303
00:58:29,074 --> 00:58:30,883
in this room, we need
it, we always love fire,

1304
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:31,886
but this helps.

1305
00:58:31,886 --> 00:58:35,173
- [Gary] What are we, double firing?

1306
00:58:35,173 --> 00:58:36,781
- Big fire.

1307
00:58:36,781 --> 00:58:38,166
On the subject of self-awareness,

1308
00:58:38,166 --> 00:58:41,267
I saw you at the Hologram,
super-dope, it was fire.

1309
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:42,955
- [Gary] Thank you, thank you.

1310
00:58:42,955 --> 00:58:44,693
- On the subject of
self-awareness, I wanted your

1311
00:58:44,693 --> 00:58:46,936
opinion on someone else's content.

1312
00:58:46,936 --> 00:58:50,288
They said that strength isn't
something you're good at

1313
00:58:50,288 --> 00:58:52,577
and weakness isn't
something you're bad at.

1314
00:58:52,577 --> 00:58:55,006
Strength is something
that strengthens you,

1315
00:58:55,006 --> 00:58:56,681
an activity that strengthens you,

1316
00:58:56,681 --> 00:58:59,460
and weakness is an
activity that weakens you,

1317
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:03,284
I've just been stuck on that
and I wanted your opinion.

1318
00:59:03,284 --> 00:59:04,666
- [Gary] One more time?

1319
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,456
- Strength isn't something you're good at,

1320
00:59:07,456 --> 00:59:09,635
you can be really good at
something and it can bore

1321
00:59:09,635 --> 00:59:12,282
the shit out of you, you
feel no passion, whatsoever.

1322
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:13,715
- [Gary] Understood.

1323
00:59:13,715 --> 00:59:17,029
- A strength is something
that strengthens you,

1324
00:59:17,029 --> 00:59:19,160
a weakness is something that weakens you.

1325
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,236
- [Gary] Yeah, cool.

1326
00:59:20,236 --> 00:59:22,945
- How much of that comes
into self-awareness?

1327
00:59:22,945 --> 00:59:26,607
- I think there's a lot
there, it makes sense to me,

1328
00:59:26,607 --> 00:59:29,009
now that I've grasped it.

1329
00:59:29,009 --> 00:59:31,924
Look, I'll be honest
with you, for somebody

1330
00:59:31,924 --> 00:59:34,050
that talks so much and puts
out fucking four quotes

1331
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:36,573
on Instagram every day, and
fucking does all this stuff,

1332
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,039
it's insane how much I hate words.

1333
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:41,686
I was just thinking,
you saying that to me,

1334
00:59:41,686 --> 00:59:44,455
I'm like, man, if somebody
is saying one of my quotes

1335
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:46,788
to their buddy, I hate that.

1336
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,657
I don't want that.

1337
00:59:49,657 --> 00:59:53,515
To me, that makes sense,
but my whole big thing is,

1338
00:59:53,515 --> 00:59:57,262
and now what, okay, cool,
a strength is a fucking

1339
00:59:57,262 --> 00:59:58,595
strength, right?

1340
00:59:59,575 --> 01:00:01,475
I don't know, every fucking
thing that I've just said,

1341
01:00:01,475 --> 01:00:03,604
to me, it's about the engine.

1342
01:00:03,604 --> 01:00:05,196
To me, why I like that you brought it up

1343
01:00:05,196 --> 01:00:08,038
is that it hit you in a way
that made you thoughtful,

1344
01:00:08,038 --> 01:00:10,716
now my question becomes,
are you gonna do anything

1345
01:00:10,716 --> 01:00:12,554
with it, right?

1346
01:00:12,554 --> 01:00:16,165
To me, what I think has
worked for me, is the reason

1347
01:00:16,165 --> 01:00:20,299
25% of people don't like
at first is I'm suffocating

1348
01:00:20,299 --> 01:00:24,785
excuses, people want to think
it's other people's faults.

1349
01:00:24,785 --> 01:00:29,004
It's fun to think you're
suppressed, it's fun when you're

1350
01:00:29,004 --> 01:00:32,589
not a manager 'cause then the
manager sucks shit, right?

1351
01:00:32,589 --> 01:00:34,214
And when you become manager,
it's the regional manager

1352
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,504
that's an asshole, and then
when you're the regional

1353
01:00:36,504 --> 01:00:39,504
manager, who's an asshole, and then.

1354
01:00:40,685 --> 01:00:43,685
(audience cheering)

1355
01:00:49,925 --> 01:00:51,632
But who does he get to blame?

1356
01:00:51,632 --> 01:00:53,750
And the answer is nobody at
least from this organization

1357
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:57,448
or like many CEOs that
I've met, my mom did this.

1358
01:00:57,448 --> 01:01:01,644
Here's the thing, to me, I
just hope it inspires you

1359
01:01:01,644 --> 01:01:04,586
to do, if it broke an
insight to you to make you do

1360
01:01:04,586 --> 01:01:06,859
something differently that tastes better,

1361
01:01:06,859 --> 01:01:08,041
then that's all I want.

1362
01:01:08,041 --> 01:01:10,650
The reason I try to
suffocate excuses it's 'cause

1363
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:13,924
it's the thing that holds
everybody down, right?

1364
01:01:13,924 --> 01:01:16,120
It's the thing that you
can rely on when you don't

1365
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,634
want to work 15 hours a day.

1366
01:01:17,634 --> 01:01:20,784
It's the thing you can
rely on when it's hard,

1367
01:01:20,784 --> 01:01:24,574
or it's painful, or you
can't figure it out.

1368
01:01:24,574 --> 01:01:28,874
And so, sounds awesome,
but what's most interesting

1369
01:01:28,874 --> 01:01:32,312
to me is it meant something
to you, now I'd rather

1370
01:01:32,312 --> 01:01:34,507
you not care about my
opinion on it, that person,

1371
01:01:34,507 --> 01:01:38,674
I want you to internalize it
and go do something with it.

1372
01:01:40,059 --> 01:01:42,476
(applauding)

1373
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:48,688
- I swear I'm gonna pass out, right.

1374
01:01:48,688 --> 01:01:50,498
- [Gary] Thanks, man.

1375
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:53,209
- So, personally I think
that growth and development

1376
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:56,485
within a company is
super-huge, you've got to grow

1377
01:01:56,485 --> 01:01:57,782
your people so that--

1378
01:01:57,782 --> 01:01:58,615
- [Gary] A 100%.

1379
01:01:58,615 --> 01:02:01,112
- So, I just want to know
what are some of the methods

1380
01:02:01,112 --> 01:02:04,056
that you use to grow somebody,
whether that's somebody

1381
01:02:04,056 --> 01:02:06,362
that you see potential
in or somebody that's--

1382
01:02:06,362 --> 01:02:08,862
- [Gary] Listening, listening.

1383
01:02:10,804 --> 01:02:11,804
- Listening?

1384
01:02:12,772 --> 01:02:14,013
Okay.

1385
01:02:14,013 --> 01:02:15,325
- It's listening.

1386
01:02:15,325 --> 01:02:19,799
There is no blueprint,
there's 3700 different things,

1387
01:02:19,799 --> 01:02:23,957
maybe you're slacking
because you're in pain

1388
01:02:23,957 --> 01:02:26,231
because your parents are
going through a tough time,

1389
01:02:26,231 --> 01:02:28,744
there's just eight million things.

1390
01:02:28,744 --> 01:02:30,535
I always tell my employees,
even once I get you

1391
01:02:30,535 --> 01:02:33,036
to a perfect place, I'm
prepared for your family

1392
01:02:33,036 --> 01:02:34,711
to die the next day.

1393
01:02:34,711 --> 01:02:36,716
And I say a very extreme
thing and I know it's a

1394
01:02:36,716 --> 01:02:39,095
weird thing to say, but I
say it because I need them

1395
01:02:39,095 --> 01:02:41,374
to understand that what
I think my responsibility

1396
01:02:41,374 --> 01:02:44,405
as a CEO is, is to be
prepared for everything.

1397
01:02:44,405 --> 01:02:48,334
Even if I get you to a
great place, the next day

1398
01:02:48,334 --> 01:02:51,542
you may lose a loved one,
or something else happens,

1399
01:02:51,542 --> 01:02:54,253
or something silly, like you're upset,

1400
01:02:54,253 --> 01:02:57,997
or Bernie Madoff happens,
like I had a friend

1401
01:02:57,997 --> 01:03:00,151
who thought he was fine
because he was gonna inherit

1402
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,448
all the money and the
family lost all the money,

1403
01:03:02,448 --> 01:03:03,448
life, right?

1404
01:03:04,291 --> 01:03:07,819
Life, you're cruising in
Puerto Rico and you have

1405
01:03:07,819 --> 01:03:10,842
a mansion and weather, like shit.

1406
01:03:10,842 --> 01:03:12,619
Stuff, right?

1407
01:03:12,619 --> 01:03:16,786
So, to me, it's always
listening, every day, forever.

1408
01:03:18,198 --> 01:03:21,865
It's not an X-ray of
today, it's not hey Susan,

1409
01:03:21,865 --> 01:03:24,748
oh Susan, you were a little
overconfident because

1410
01:03:24,748 --> 01:03:26,585
you were a good student,
but that doesn't actually

1411
01:03:26,585 --> 01:03:28,969
translate to life, so let
me deploy a little humility

1412
01:03:28,969 --> 01:03:30,737
so you understand what
the real world looks like,

1413
01:03:30,737 --> 01:03:32,950
oh now you're in a better
place, you understand?

1414
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:36,867
But a leader is always
on oxygen, it's forever,

1415
01:03:39,043 --> 01:03:40,893
so that's how I think about it.

1416
01:03:40,893 --> 01:03:41,738
- [Audience Member] I've got one more.

1417
01:03:41,738 --> 01:03:42,645
- Go ahead.

1418
01:03:42,645 --> 01:03:43,804
- Can I take a selfie with you?

1419
01:03:43,804 --> 01:03:44,637
- Sure.

1420
01:03:47,879 --> 01:03:48,796
Who's next?

1421
01:03:52,614 --> 01:03:55,545
Go ahead, I can double task.

1422
01:03:55,545 --> 01:03:57,694
Dude, what's up with your fucking screen?

1423
01:03:57,694 --> 01:03:58,833
It's shattered.

1424
01:03:58,833 --> 01:04:00,428
- It got ran over by a go kart.

1425
01:04:00,428 --> 01:04:01,350
- By a go kart?

1426
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:02,313
You're gonna get a new one?

1427
01:04:02,313 --> 01:04:03,146
- Yeah.

1428
01:04:04,214 --> 01:04:07,214
(audience cheering)

1429
01:04:11,383 --> 01:04:14,466
- Hi, I'm Marisa, I'm from EG Oregon.

1430
01:04:16,991 --> 01:04:19,854
First I'd like to see I
acknowledge the Russian-Jewish

1431
01:04:19,854 --> 01:04:21,742
heritage, I am too, so I'd like to say

1432
01:04:21,742 --> 01:04:23,931
(speaks in Hebrew).

1433
01:04:23,931 --> 01:04:25,758
- [Gary] Thank you, thank you.

1434
01:04:25,758 --> 01:04:29,136
- Also, I was just wondering,
how long did it take you

1435
01:04:29,136 --> 01:04:32,664
to find the balance between
your work and your life?

1436
01:04:32,664 --> 01:04:35,893
You say you work 18 hours
a day, do you work while

1437
01:04:35,893 --> 01:04:38,226
you sleep as well and just--

1438
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:40,462
- [Gary] I sleep really easy.

1439
01:04:40,462 --> 01:04:42,710
- Good, I'm glad.

1440
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:44,710
- Because I'm exhausted.

1441
01:04:46,346 --> 01:04:48,120
I've never thought of them separate.

1442
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,553
Hold on to the mic, hold on.

1443
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:51,581
It's funny when you asked
that, I've never thought

1444
01:04:51,581 --> 01:04:54,498
of them separate, I really haven't.

1445
01:04:55,537 --> 01:04:58,926
And that's cool because we work a lot.

1446
01:04:58,926 --> 01:05:02,411
It's funny because a lot
of people are confused

1447
01:05:02,411 --> 01:05:04,625
by my message, it's
when I bring up my buddy

1448
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:08,926
in Califon, New Jersey,
making 50K, on 17 softball,

1449
01:05:08,926 --> 01:05:12,530
I want that, I don't want
the Jets or I'm gonna buy

1450
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:17,293
the Sea Hawks, I want people
to just figure themselves out.

1451
01:05:17,293 --> 01:05:19,676
I figured myself out, by
the way, being a workaholic

1452
01:05:19,676 --> 01:05:21,815
is frowned upon.

1453
01:05:21,815 --> 01:05:24,445
By the way, somebody
wrote an off-hand piece

1454
01:05:24,445 --> 01:05:27,852
in New York times that shit
on me because I work too much.

1455
01:05:27,852 --> 01:05:31,649
There's always two sides,
there's a lot of people who judge

1456
01:05:31,649 --> 01:05:34,083
my parenting style, they
think just because they come

1457
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:36,197
home at six o'clock and don't
really pay attention to their

1458
01:05:36,197 --> 01:05:38,177
kids, but they're
physically in the building,

1459
01:05:38,177 --> 01:05:41,126
that they're better dads than I am.

1460
01:05:41,126 --> 01:05:45,067
I respect their point of view,
I understand how they can

1461
01:05:45,067 --> 01:05:48,636
go there, it makes them feel
better about themselves,

1462
01:05:48,636 --> 01:05:52,678
I just understand, but you
know, to me, I want you

1463
01:05:52,678 --> 01:05:56,845
to make work and life the same
whether that's nine to five,

1464
01:05:58,389 --> 01:05:59,904
whether that's nine to three as a teacher

1465
01:05:59,904 --> 01:06:01,064
and having the whole summer off,

1466
01:06:01,064 --> 01:06:04,161
whether that's 18 hours
a day, because it's just

1467
01:06:04,161 --> 01:06:07,816
too big of a percentage
of our time on Earth.

1468
01:06:07,816 --> 01:06:12,286
It's literally what we
spend the most time on.

1469
01:06:12,286 --> 01:06:14,022
It's crazy.

1470
01:06:14,022 --> 01:06:17,464
So, to me, the only people
I know who make a $120,000

1471
01:06:17,464 --> 01:06:22,342
a year, who if they made
89,000 would be 50,000 times

1472
01:06:22,342 --> 01:06:25,411
happier and the only variable
difference is instead of

1473
01:06:25,411 --> 01:06:28,809
driving a BMW, they'd
have to drive a Toyota?

1474
01:06:28,809 --> 01:06:33,193
It's crazy how people get
caught up in the wrong shit,

1475
01:06:33,193 --> 01:06:35,384
so to answer your question, I've no idea.

1476
01:06:35,384 --> 01:06:36,441
I've never thought of it differently.

1477
01:06:36,441 --> 01:06:37,830
I grew up in a family business,

1478
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:39,719
so it's super-intertwined, right?

1479
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:42,627
- That was kind of my
question, have you always known

1480
01:06:42,627 --> 01:06:45,457
that you were going to be
a CEO and an entrepreneur

1481
01:06:45,457 --> 01:06:49,477
and all these big
businesses that you have?

1482
01:06:49,477 --> 01:06:53,869
- I knew that I was a
fucking terrible student,

1483
01:06:53,869 --> 01:06:56,450
so education wasn't going to be my path.

1484
01:06:56,450 --> 01:06:59,153
I knew that I wanted
to pay my parents back

1485
01:06:59,153 --> 01:07:01,685
for being the best parents
ever and getting me out of

1486
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:04,420
communist Russia, I felt
a real passion for that,

1487
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:07,035
so I did think, okay, I'm
not gonna get a great job

1488
01:07:07,035 --> 01:07:08,927
because I don't have a
good education, so I'm

1489
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:11,171
gonna go into dad's store,
I'm gonna build it up for him,

1490
01:07:11,171 --> 01:07:13,912
and then during that time, you know,

1491
01:07:13,912 --> 01:07:15,422
all of us are still
learning about ourselves,

1492
01:07:15,422 --> 01:07:17,902
whether we're 45 or 14, you
just keep learning, right?

1493
01:07:17,902 --> 01:07:19,705
Somewhere along the line, I'm like, wow,

1494
01:07:19,705 --> 01:07:21,154
I'm a really good salesman,
and then I'm like,

1495
01:07:21,154 --> 01:07:22,805
wow, I'm a really good
businessman, oh, I'm a really

1496
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:24,089
good manager, oh I'm a really good boss,

1497
01:07:24,089 --> 01:07:26,543
I'm a really good marketer,
you know, you just start

1498
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:30,596
building and then when YouTube
came out and I predicted

1499
01:07:30,596 --> 01:07:34,198
that would be big, after
email, after Google Ad Words,

1500
01:07:34,198 --> 01:07:36,061
then I'm like, I've got a
knack for what people are

1501
01:07:36,061 --> 01:07:38,372
gonna do before, then I
infested in Facebook and Twitter

1502
01:07:38,372 --> 01:07:40,915
and Tumblr, and you just
build it, and even now,

1503
01:07:40,915 --> 01:07:43,458
I never thought that I'd inspire people,

1504
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:44,744
I thought I was a businessman.

1505
01:07:44,744 --> 01:07:47,601
Who thought that
entrepreneurship would be like an

1506
01:07:47,601 --> 01:07:50,060
athlete or a rapper, it's crazy.

1507
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:51,565
For me, I went to the Jets game yesterday,

1508
01:07:51,565 --> 01:07:54,958
30-year-old dudes, I'm like what the fuck,

1509
01:07:54,958 --> 01:07:58,791
be up in this bitch, so
you don't know, right?

1510
01:08:00,803 --> 01:08:04,970
But I do know one thing,
doing something for a living

1511
01:08:05,995 --> 01:08:09,240
eight hours a day, when
you sleep eight hours,

1512
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,456
I mean, it's a third of your life.

1513
01:08:11,456 --> 01:08:14,197
It's so, maybe half of your life.

1514
01:08:14,197 --> 01:08:16,977
I'm just desperate for
people to do shit they like,

1515
01:08:16,977 --> 01:08:19,340
and if they like something
that pays them less,

1516
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:21,902
you don't need fancy shit,
you'll be much happier

1517
01:08:21,902 --> 01:08:22,819
at the end.

1518
01:08:23,721 --> 01:08:24,554
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

1519
01:08:24,555 --> 01:08:25,388
- Welcome.

1520
01:08:28,890 --> 01:08:31,377
- [Audience Member]
What's up, Gary, I'm Mike,

1521
01:08:31,377 --> 01:08:33,544
and I'm here from Arizona.

1522
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:36,673
- This is the best.

1523
01:08:36,673 --> 01:08:38,937
- [Audience Member] Nailed it.

1524
01:08:38,937 --> 01:08:40,783
- I'm like seriously
thinking about starting a new

1525
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,842
Jersey location, just so
they could be represented

1526
01:08:43,843 --> 01:08:45,093
here next year.

1527
01:08:46,231 --> 01:08:47,984
- [Audience Member] I grew
up at Bridgewood, so we got

1528
01:08:47,984 --> 01:08:48,852
someone there.

1529
01:08:48,853 --> 01:08:50,004
- [Gary] Let's go, man.

1530
01:08:50,004 --> 01:08:51,346
- So my question for you is, as manager,

1531
01:08:51,346 --> 01:08:53,473
is we spend a lot of time
hiring people who are like

1532
01:08:53,474 --> 01:08:55,618
that millennial generation, I'm in it,

1533
01:08:55,618 --> 01:08:57,451
a lot of us are in it.

1534
01:08:59,229 --> 01:09:00,677
You talk a lot about self-awareness,

1535
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:03,665
how do you recognize that in
a 10 to 15 minute interview,

1536
01:09:03,665 --> 01:09:05,277
how do I know that the
person I'm gonna hire is--

1537
01:09:05,277 --> 01:09:06,727
- [Gary] You don't.

1538
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:08,060
- Dang it, Gary.

1539
01:09:09,511 --> 01:09:13,678
- I got really good hiring
advice, learn to fire fast.

1540
01:09:15,788 --> 01:09:17,512
If you guys, especially
for what you guys do

1541
01:09:17,513 --> 01:09:19,867
for a living, I get it,
I used to pay people 9.50

1542
01:09:19,867 --> 01:09:22,675
an hour, 12.50 an hour,
stock guys at liquor store,

1543
01:09:22,675 --> 01:09:26,354
I did, I did what you did
for a long time in my life.

1544
01:09:26,354 --> 01:09:29,854
Everybody has their ego tied up in hiring.

1545
01:09:31,268 --> 01:09:33,384
You guys have your ego
tied up in your hiring,

1546
01:09:33,384 --> 01:09:35,756
you think you're so good
at hiring and then you hire

1547
01:09:35,756 --> 01:09:37,573
somebody and they're
shit, but you may pretend

1548
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:39,429
they're not because firing them admits

1549
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:42,255
that you were wrong, so it's
your own ego that's holding

1550
01:09:42,255 --> 01:09:46,625
you back, my ego is only
balanced by my humility.

1551
01:09:46,625 --> 01:09:48,603
I hired somebody for hundreds
of thousands of dollars

1552
01:09:48,603 --> 01:09:52,622
the other day, six months
ago, I interviewed them

1553
01:09:52,622 --> 01:09:56,181
three times, three times,
that's a lot of time for me,

1554
01:09:56,181 --> 01:10:00,348
I fired him one day into
him working at Vayner Media.

1555
01:10:01,982 --> 01:10:05,029
One day, now I fired
him four months later,

1556
01:10:05,029 --> 01:10:07,738
but in my day, he literally
got fired the first day.

1557
01:10:07,738 --> 01:10:08,655
Like, fuck.

1558
01:10:11,225 --> 01:10:14,740
So, especially for this
business, for all of you guys,

1559
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:17,552
check your ego at the
door, you're not that great

1560
01:10:17,552 --> 01:10:20,612
at fucking hiring, but
good news, nobody is.

1561
01:10:20,612 --> 01:10:22,211
Get good at firing.

1562
01:10:22,211 --> 01:10:25,676
- [Audience Member] Thank you, Gary.

1563
01:10:25,676 --> 01:10:27,504
- That one's gonna work for you guys,

1564
01:10:27,504 --> 01:10:28,641
that one's gonna be a big one.

1565
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,391
Watch margin explode.

1566
01:10:32,088 --> 01:10:33,117
- What's up, Gary?

1567
01:10:33,117 --> 01:10:35,703
- Because let me tell you why
margins are gonna explore,

1568
01:10:35,703 --> 01:10:37,848
if you're not sitting and
dwelling about what you're

1569
01:10:37,848 --> 01:10:40,162
gonna do with fucking suckie-ass Rick,

1570
01:10:40,162 --> 01:10:41,524
you guys are gonna
worry about the customer

1571
01:10:41,524 --> 01:10:43,752
and maximizing margin.

1572
01:10:43,752 --> 01:10:44,585
Fire!

1573
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:46,950
Go ahead.

1574
01:10:47,982 --> 01:10:51,815
- So, my name's Daniel,
I'm from Corin, Idaho,

1575
01:10:53,348 --> 01:10:54,838
got my group over there.

1576
01:10:54,838 --> 01:10:56,670
I actually kind of hopped.

1577
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:57,503
- [Gary] Yeah, I was about to ask you,

1578
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:58,645
what the fuck are you doing there,

1579
01:10:58,645 --> 01:11:00,829
their line is right there.

1580
01:11:00,829 --> 01:11:04,478
- Shorter line, man, hopped
over there, came here,

1581
01:11:04,478 --> 01:11:05,454
just one person.

1582
01:11:05,454 --> 01:11:08,071
- [Gary] I appreciate the hustle.

1583
01:11:08,071 --> 01:11:09,606
- Anyway, so I got a couple of questions.

1584
01:11:09,606 --> 01:11:11,303
- Actually you know what's crazy by that?

1585
01:11:11,303 --> 01:11:14,803
I'm actually weirdly intrigued by you now.

1586
01:11:15,641 --> 01:11:16,720
I'm being dead serious,

1587
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:18,521
that's just a smart hack.

1588
01:11:18,521 --> 01:11:19,771
I like it.

1589
01:11:19,771 --> 01:11:21,063
- You know, word, I thought it would maybe

1590
01:11:21,063 --> 01:11:22,982
give them some more time,
but just I came here,

1591
01:11:22,982 --> 01:11:23,844
so it worked.

1592
01:11:23,844 --> 01:11:25,014
- [Gary] Good shit.

1593
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:28,081
- Anyway, couple of things
I wanted to ask you,

1594
01:11:28,081 --> 01:11:30,020
first thing, how do you
not burn yourself out

1595
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:32,227
when you're pushing yourself
so hard all the time?

1596
01:11:32,227 --> 01:11:34,533
I always hear people
tell me, my whole life,

1597
01:11:34,533 --> 01:11:36,356
Dan, if you push yourself
so hard in this area,

1598
01:11:36,356 --> 01:11:37,267
you'll burn out.

1599
01:11:37,267 --> 01:11:39,515
- [Gary] Do you feel it that way?

1600
01:11:39,515 --> 01:11:40,348
- No.

1601
01:11:40,348 --> 01:11:42,181
- Because you love it.

1602
01:11:45,193 --> 01:11:49,110
If you asked me to hang
a picture on that wall,

1603
01:11:50,861 --> 01:11:53,091
I would burn myself up
before I even got halfway

1604
01:11:53,091 --> 01:11:54,174
to that wall.

1605
01:11:55,533 --> 01:11:57,750
But if you told me to run
like a 500 million dollar

1606
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:00,837
business for the next 17
years, 18 hours a day,

1607
01:12:00,837 --> 01:12:02,587
I'd be like, you bet.

1608
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:05,940
- Okay, so another thing
I wanted to ask you,

1609
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:09,466
if you are that point I guess,
great leaders can inspire

1610
01:12:09,466 --> 01:12:12,201
people, bringing them kind
of the same point, right,

1611
01:12:12,201 --> 01:12:14,092
the same goal, same
mission, how can you inspire

1612
01:12:14,092 --> 01:12:16,621
other people to feel that same desire

1613
01:12:16,621 --> 01:12:18,223
to keep pushing it non-stop, not feel like

1614
01:12:18,223 --> 01:12:20,320
they need to take a break every other day,

1615
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,560
you know what I mean?

1616
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:24,290
- By listening to them,
it's gonna be the same shit,

1617
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:27,798
guys, it's not about us,
you're like, you're a great

1618
01:12:27,798 --> 01:12:30,423
leader, inspire them,
yeah, by never thinking

1619
01:12:30,423 --> 01:12:33,313
about my part, I'm a
great leader and I inspire

1620
01:12:33,313 --> 01:12:36,881
because I listen, because
I deliver when people

1621
01:12:36,881 --> 01:12:39,255
ask for things, including,
hey I don't like this,

1622
01:12:39,255 --> 01:12:40,887
I'm like, look, you don't like this,

1623
01:12:40,887 --> 01:12:44,104
so there's somebody I'm
about to let go, right?

1624
01:12:44,104 --> 01:12:46,942
She's on her seventh department,

1625
01:12:46,942 --> 01:12:48,550
she didn't want to do this,
she didn't want to do that,

1626
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:50,925
right, and I've been
trying, trying, that's it,

1627
01:12:50,925 --> 01:12:55,214
I'm over it, tried, really,
seven is fucking crazy.

1628
01:12:55,214 --> 01:12:57,631
And so, it's about them, bro.

1629
01:12:59,382 --> 01:13:03,125
By the way, to build a great organization,

1630
01:13:03,125 --> 01:13:04,708
you need Bs and Cs.

1631
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:07,147
I love C-players.

1632
01:13:09,642 --> 01:13:12,225
Who's gonna do a C-player shit?

1633
01:13:13,997 --> 01:13:17,548
If we all had As, nobody
would be doing anything.

1634
01:13:17,548 --> 01:13:19,502
Everybody would be
strategizing and architecting,

1635
01:13:19,502 --> 01:13:21,342
and I love people on my vlog are like,

1636
01:13:21,342 --> 01:13:24,477
what do you do all day,
you don't fucking work,

1637
01:13:24,477 --> 01:13:25,627
you have meetings all day.

1638
01:13:25,627 --> 01:13:27,230
I'm like, yeah.

1639
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:30,518
Understand, 16-year-old
Charlie from Calgary

1640
01:13:30,518 --> 01:13:33,870
that doesn't know what the
fuck he's talking about,

1641
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:36,850
you'll one day hopefully
understand what it is,

1642
01:13:36,850 --> 01:13:39,334
because you're thinking all
day, you're making decisions

1643
01:13:39,334 --> 01:13:42,203
all day, that's what an executive does.

1644
01:13:42,203 --> 01:13:46,370
I miss the times of stocking
shelves, it was easy,

1645
01:13:47,262 --> 01:13:48,664
it was fucking fun.

1646
01:13:48,664 --> 01:13:52,187
And so, yeah, man, it's
about them, and they're

1647
01:13:52,187 --> 01:13:55,864
not gonna be you, they're
not as ambitious as you,

1648
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:56,870
and that's awesome.

1649
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:59,088
What you should do is figure that out,

1650
01:13:59,088 --> 01:14:00,725
and then try to make them the best version

1651
01:14:00,725 --> 01:14:05,073
of that player, not everybody
can be the quarterback, man.

1652
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:07,156
Long snappers matter too.

1653
01:14:12,594 --> 01:14:13,910
- [Audience Member] Hey, Gary, what's up?

1654
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:14,743
- How are you, my man?

1655
01:14:14,743 --> 01:14:17,243
- Good, man, my name is Chris.

1656
01:14:21,816 --> 01:14:25,204
First of all, I've been
sitting here, listening to you,

1657
01:14:25,204 --> 01:14:28,357
it's amazing, stumbled across
your USC video a couple

1658
01:14:28,357 --> 01:14:31,960
of years ago, and I've just
absorbed tons of your content.

1659
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,007
- [Gary] Thanks, brother.

1660
01:14:34,007 --> 01:14:36,573
- And I also think it's cool
that my wife and I were in

1661
01:14:36,573 --> 01:14:40,020
New York about a year ago
and I sent a Tweet at you,

1662
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:42,928
asking if you wanted to
go to the Knicks game

1663
01:14:42,928 --> 01:14:45,186
and I thought it was so cool
that you actually responded,

1664
01:14:45,186 --> 01:14:46,902
like you say you do.

1665
01:14:46,902 --> 01:14:47,880
- [Gary] Thanks man.

1666
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,350
- And you sent a video,
I thought that was rad.

1667
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:50,405
- [Gary] Thank you man.

1668
01:14:50,405 --> 01:14:51,414
- Yeah, that was cool.

1669
01:14:51,414 --> 01:14:52,489
- [Gary] I appreciate it.

1670
01:14:52,489 --> 01:14:54,510
- Question that I have for
you kind of in my head--

1671
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:56,310
- And by the way, real quick, I apologize,

1672
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:59,237
that to me is super-important,
especially for a lot

1673
01:14:59,237 --> 01:15:01,893
of managers here, when a
customer tweets anything

1674
01:15:01,893 --> 01:15:04,643
about your business, take
the 13 seconds on the way

1675
01:15:04,643 --> 01:15:07,776
to going and taking a piss
to make a video and be like

1676
01:15:07,776 --> 01:15:11,287
thank you or I'm sorry, it's so powerful.

1677
01:15:11,287 --> 01:15:12,704
I'm busy as fuck.

1678
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:15,259
Dude's in New York, like, you
want to come to the Knicks

1679
01:15:15,259 --> 01:15:16,644
game, that's not the
shit that you're supposed

1680
01:15:16,644 --> 01:15:21,104
to be answering, but because
I did, it builds a deeper

1681
01:15:21,104 --> 01:15:24,187
relationship with us, it's just real.

1682
01:15:25,731 --> 01:15:28,648
So, actually I got something fun,

1683
01:15:28,648 --> 01:15:30,020
while we're having this
conversation, I want everybody

1684
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:33,095
to open up Instagram, and go
to Oprah Winfrey's account,

1685
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:36,330
@Oprah, and I want you to
scroll all the way down,

1686
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:39,344
all the way down, to her first photo ever,

1687
01:15:39,344 --> 01:15:42,545
I want you to look at it
while I'm giving this point.

1688
01:15:42,545 --> 01:15:46,537
I'm sitting with her and I'm
putting Oprah on Instagram,

1689
01:15:46,537 --> 01:15:48,510
I'm in a room with Oprah-fucking-Winfrey,

1690
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:52,549
and I'm like, Oprah, Instagram,
it's gonna be important,

1691
01:15:52,549 --> 01:15:55,660
and she's like, t-d-d, I'm
trying to explain to her

1692
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:58,589
why it's so important to reply to people.

1693
01:15:58,589 --> 01:16:00,693
And I go to her, when
you were doing your show

1694
01:16:00,693 --> 01:16:03,613
at the height of your
popularity, when you guys

1695
01:16:03,613 --> 01:16:06,274
would stop and reset the cameras, right?

1696
01:16:06,274 --> 01:16:09,218
I'm like, do you ever look
at anybody in the audience?

1697
01:16:09,218 --> 01:16:10,913
And she's like, yeah.

1698
01:16:10,913 --> 01:16:13,693
And I was like, did you ever
smiler or wink at anybody?

1699
01:16:13,693 --> 01:16:15,544
She's like, yeah.

1700
01:16:15,544 --> 01:16:17,548
I'm like, do you know they
will be telling that story

1701
01:16:17,548 --> 01:16:19,381
for the last 15 years?

1702
01:16:20,223 --> 01:16:23,884
It matters, man, depth versus width.

1703
01:16:23,884 --> 01:16:26,959
The way you get more customer
count in your locations

1704
01:16:26,959 --> 01:16:29,492
is by over-indexing on the
ones that are coming in

1705
01:16:29,492 --> 01:16:31,075
in the first place.

1706
01:16:32,073 --> 01:16:32,906
Go ahead.

1707
01:16:34,208 --> 01:16:35,810
- Something going along with
that that I've told a lot

1708
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:38,999
of my crew about is that
Ricky Henderson effect

1709
01:16:38,999 --> 01:16:40,895
that you talk about, I think that's huge.

1710
01:16:40,895 --> 01:16:42,834
- That's what I call it.

1711
01:16:42,834 --> 01:16:44,466
Just real quick, when
I was 10, I went to a

1712
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:46,397
Yankees game, it was my
first game, we were poor,

1713
01:16:46,397 --> 01:16:51,064
going to a game was crazy,
I think I wore a suit.

1714
01:16:51,064 --> 01:16:53,691
And Ricky Henderson was
coming off the field

1715
01:16:53,691 --> 01:16:56,179
and I stood up and he winked.

1716
01:16:56,179 --> 01:16:57,211
Now, what's crazy about the story is,

1717
01:16:57,211 --> 01:17:01,518
it's like, 80 people just
thought I winked at them.

1718
01:17:01,518 --> 01:17:03,727
Right, so I don't know if
he really winked at me,

1719
01:17:03,727 --> 01:17:06,695
but the amount of Ricky
Henderson baseball cards,

1720
01:17:06,695 --> 01:17:11,156
jerseys, here I am, right,
30 years later, talking about

1721
01:17:11,156 --> 01:17:14,563
Ricky Henderson, depth,
man, depth versus width.

1722
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:17,164
And by the way, that's how
you've got to manage Sally

1723
01:17:17,164 --> 01:17:19,688
who works for you for
four months at the front

1724
01:17:19,688 --> 01:17:23,030
of the store because you
really gave a fuck in 13 years

1725
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:26,345
when she's a top executive,
does a business development deal

1726
01:17:26,345 --> 01:17:28,208
with you because you did the right thing,

1727
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:32,375
because kindness is practical
and karma is ROI positive.

1728
01:17:34,799 --> 01:17:38,137
Honestly, honestly, this was
not a big enough reaction

1729
01:17:38,137 --> 01:17:41,094
to that statement, you've got
to really get it to your head,

1730
01:17:41,094 --> 01:17:44,546
those claps are dick for what I just said.

1731
01:17:44,546 --> 01:17:47,296
It's a big deal, it's a big deal.

1732
01:17:51,983 --> 01:17:56,150
- Yeah, so my actual question,
I've seen you scale from

1733
01:17:59,838 --> 01:18:02,576
400 people a couple of
years ago to 800 now,

1734
01:18:02,576 --> 01:18:05,420
and we've grown a lot, my wife
and I have about 250 people

1735
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:08,716
on our crew and it's
been really hard on me,

1736
01:18:08,716 --> 01:18:10,533
we've grown quickly in the last year,

1737
01:18:10,533 --> 01:18:13,086
we've went from about a
hundred to 250 in a year.

1738
01:18:13,086 --> 01:18:14,083
- [Gary] More locations?

1739
01:18:14,083 --> 01:18:15,417
- Yeah.

1740
01:18:15,417 --> 01:18:18,750
So, how do you connect with your people?

1741
01:18:20,933 --> 01:18:22,393
- [Gary] Technology.

1742
01:18:22,393 --> 01:18:24,497
Do you have everybody on your text?

1743
01:18:24,497 --> 01:18:25,330
- Yeah.

1744
01:18:26,254 --> 01:18:28,619
- Lay in bed and text them.

1745
01:18:28,619 --> 01:18:30,949
Here's a big one, here's a big one.

1746
01:18:30,949 --> 01:18:34,444
Don't judge yourselves, there's
230 Vayner Media employees

1747
01:18:34,444 --> 01:18:35,978
watching this video right now, being like,

1748
01:18:35,978 --> 01:18:39,916
fuck that guy, I haven't heard
from him in seven months.

1749
01:18:39,916 --> 01:18:43,175
I don't judge myself, I
know I'm trying with all

1750
01:18:43,175 --> 01:18:45,958
my fucking might, but if
something slips through the

1751
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:48,171
cracks or if I go through a bad rally,

1752
01:18:48,171 --> 01:18:52,097
or to maybe my number
one, two, three, my guy

1753
01:18:52,097 --> 01:18:53,830
who's like, fuck you don't talk to me,

1754
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:56,094
I don't judge myself.

1755
01:18:56,094 --> 01:18:59,517
I try real hard, but I don't
cripple myself by shortcomings

1756
01:18:59,517 --> 01:19:02,255
because I know that I'm trying
harder and better than most

1757
01:19:02,255 --> 01:19:05,173
and life is about alternatives.

1758
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:07,831
When I'm most down on
fuck, I say to myself

1759
01:19:07,831 --> 01:19:12,230
would they be better off
somewhere else, the answer is no.

1760
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:13,249
- [Audience Member]
That's good, thank you.

1761
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:14,332
- You got it.

1762
01:19:19,523 --> 01:19:20,520
How are you?

1763
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,361
- I'm doing phenomenal, man.

1764
01:19:22,361 --> 01:19:23,194
- [Gary] I love it.

1765
01:19:23,194 --> 01:19:25,147
- I couldn't ask for any more.

1766
01:19:25,147 --> 01:19:26,945
- [Gary] You're the best.

1767
01:19:26,945 --> 01:19:30,313
- And I don't even work
for Dutch Brothers.

1768
01:19:30,313 --> 01:19:31,442
- [Gary] You snuck in?

1769
01:19:31,442 --> 01:19:34,881
- Yeah, I just rolled in,
but I love all these people.

1770
01:19:34,881 --> 01:19:36,276
- [Gary] Yeah, they're great.

1771
01:19:36,276 --> 01:19:38,561
- And this atmosphere.

1772
01:19:38,561 --> 01:19:41,889
- [Gary] So did you
literally break the fuck in?

1773
01:19:41,889 --> 01:19:43,508
- No, I got a free ticket.

1774
01:19:43,508 --> 01:19:45,834
- Oh, respect, respect, I would've thought

1775
01:19:45,834 --> 01:19:50,180
it would've been way cooler
if you just snuck the fuck in.

1776
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:52,307
- I heard you were speaking here,

1777
01:19:52,307 --> 01:19:54,488
so I came down from Southern Washington.

1778
01:19:54,488 --> 01:19:56,206
- [Gary] I'm flattered, how are you?

1779
01:19:56,206 --> 01:20:00,356
- I'm doing phenomenal,
I'm a dishwasher at

1780
01:20:00,356 --> 01:20:03,603
Trapers' Sushi currently and
have been for a few years,

1781
01:20:03,603 --> 01:20:06,025
but I'm trying to break
out of that and move up

1782
01:20:06,025 --> 01:20:07,762
in the restaurant.

1783
01:20:07,762 --> 01:20:11,138
And hopefully one day become
a sushi chef and hopefully

1784
01:20:11,138 --> 01:20:13,138
not cut off any fingers.

1785
01:20:15,015 --> 01:20:17,649
- Though, if you did, that
could bring a lot of awareness

1786
01:20:17,649 --> 01:20:20,801
to you and maybe create a
viral moment that could be

1787
01:20:20,801 --> 01:20:22,352
ROI positive.

1788
01:20:22,352 --> 01:20:23,556
- [Audience Member] True, true.

1789
01:20:23,556 --> 01:20:25,912
- Just keep that in the back of your mind.

1790
01:20:25,912 --> 01:20:28,785
- But between my multiple sclerosis

1791
01:20:28,785 --> 01:20:30,315
and my traumatic brain injury

1792
01:20:30,315 --> 01:20:33,533
I had from when I was
a kid, I have symptoms,

1793
01:20:33,533 --> 01:20:37,116
defects, whatever, that
would hold me back,

1794
01:20:38,319 --> 01:20:42,486
but I'm still moving forward,
I'm a marathon runner,

1795
01:20:43,798 --> 01:20:46,297
I run races all the time.

1796
01:20:46,297 --> 01:20:49,297
(audience cheering)

1797
01:20:51,617 --> 01:20:54,704
It's because my legs are
hurting from this half-marathon

1798
01:20:54,704 --> 01:20:57,699
I ran yesterday and the day before I ran

1799
01:20:57,699 --> 01:21:01,589
the (mumbles) in Washington,

1800
01:21:01,589 --> 01:21:05,605
but anyway, I've written
one book and I'm becoming

1801
01:21:05,605 --> 01:21:10,429
what I am, a motivational
author, and wanna-be speaker.

1802
01:21:10,429 --> 01:21:11,451
- [Gary] Love it.

1803
01:21:11,451 --> 01:21:16,442
- Thank you, and yeah, I'm
just wanting to move forward

1804
01:21:16,442 --> 01:21:18,972
with that, and I'm working
on my second book right now,

1805
01:21:18,972 --> 01:21:22,147
and I've started, and
watching you in the past

1806
01:21:22,147 --> 01:21:24,779
few months or a year, I've
been totally fired up.

1807
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:25,758
- [Gary] Thank you.

1808
01:21:25,758 --> 01:21:26,651
- And I love you, man.

1809
01:21:26,651 --> 01:21:27,860
- [Gary] I love you back.

1810
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:28,860
- Thank you.

1811
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:31,022
- [Gary] Are you trying
to figure out how to make

1812
01:21:31,022 --> 01:21:32,424
that more successful?

1813
01:21:32,424 --> 01:21:33,412
- Yeah.

1814
01:21:33,412 --> 01:21:36,048
- [Gary] Are you putting out
content on a daily basis?

1815
01:21:36,048 --> 01:21:36,881
- Yes, I am.

1816
01:21:36,881 --> 01:21:37,714
- [Gary] How?

1817
01:21:37,714 --> 01:21:38,930
- On my Facebook.

1818
01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:40,628
- [Gary] What about YouTube?

1819
01:21:40,628 --> 01:21:43,777
- I'm working on, I've started
on YouTube, I just haven't

1820
01:21:43,777 --> 01:21:45,400
done very much all.

1821
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,491
- What about Instagram?

1822
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:49,387
- [Audience Member] I've
downloaded Instagram and begun

1823
01:21:49,387 --> 01:21:51,323
putting content on
there, just haven't gone

1824
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:52,833
full force into it.

1825
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:54,158
- What's your name, Shane?

1826
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:55,369
- [Audience Member] Shane.

1827
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:57,125
- Shane, let's go a different route.

1828
01:21:57,125 --> 01:21:58,448
Shane, I want you to do
me a favor, I want you

1829
01:21:58,448 --> 01:22:02,912
to send me an email to
gary@vaynermedia.com, okay?

1830
01:22:02,912 --> 01:22:03,745
- [Audience Member] Okay.

1831
01:22:03,745 --> 01:22:04,578
- You got that?

1832
01:22:04,578 --> 01:22:05,411
You know Vayner Media right?

1833
01:22:05,411 --> 01:22:06,244
- [Audience Member] Yeah.

1834
01:22:06,244 --> 01:22:07,077
Vayner Media.

1835
01:22:07,077 --> 01:22:10,746
- Just say, Shane, I'm the
guy who spoke at the event,

1836
01:22:10,746 --> 01:22:13,974
and the marathons, you made the
joke about cutting the thing

1837
01:22:13,974 --> 01:22:16,734
and all that, put it
all in the title, okay?

1838
01:22:16,734 --> 01:22:18,415
- [Audience Member] Okay.

1839
01:22:18,415 --> 01:22:20,692
- Instead of me giving
you one tid-bit, Shane,

1840
01:22:20,692 --> 01:22:23,130
I'm gonna fly you to New York city,

1841
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:26,113
to Vayner Media, and you're gonna spend

1842
01:22:26,113 --> 01:22:30,280
a day with me and my team and
we'll show you what to do.

1843
01:22:34,392 --> 01:22:35,559
Love you back!

1844
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:57,955
Let's keep going.

1845
01:23:02,378 --> 01:23:05,739
How are you gonna top that, bro?

1846
01:23:05,739 --> 01:23:07,156
Worst spot, ever.

1847
01:23:09,197 --> 01:23:10,532
- How are you, Gary?

1848
01:23:10,532 --> 01:23:11,365
- [Gary] How are you?

1849
01:23:11,365 --> 01:23:12,288
- I'm good.

1850
01:23:12,288 --> 01:23:15,590
Name's Dan, and I respect
that you're a straight

1851
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:18,590
shooter, you don't sugar-coat anything.

1852
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:21,207
And I'm just curious what you have for us,

1853
01:23:21,207 --> 01:23:25,446
as a company, as your biggest
criticism or some advice

1854
01:23:25,446 --> 01:23:27,867
for us as a company.

1855
01:23:27,867 --> 01:23:29,410
- That's a great question.

1856
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:30,858
You know what's cool about that?

1857
01:23:30,858 --> 01:23:32,961
That's a super-great question, and fuck,

1858
01:23:32,961 --> 01:23:34,782
I'm really sad with what I'm about to say,

1859
01:23:34,782 --> 01:23:39,436
which is, so at marketing
conferences a lot of people say,

1860
01:23:39,436 --> 01:23:41,096
hey, this happens every conference,

1861
01:23:41,096 --> 01:23:44,179
hey, Gary, name one brand
that's doing social media

1862
01:23:44,179 --> 01:23:47,389
really well that's not
a Vayner Media client,

1863
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:51,254
and I always look like a
douche because I don't know.

1864
01:23:51,254 --> 01:23:53,504
And the answer, this is
such a great question,

1865
01:23:53,504 --> 01:23:56,065
and it's a great follow
up to that moment, I can't

1866
01:23:56,065 --> 01:23:58,949
answer because I've not
spent one minute auditing

1867
01:23:58,949 --> 01:24:01,057
the marketing or the organization.

1868
01:24:01,057 --> 01:24:04,504
I understand the founder's
intent very clearly,

1869
01:24:04,504 --> 01:24:06,833
we've had some people out
from the organization,

1870
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:09,463
at four D's, for one day
section, so I got a little vibe,

1871
01:24:09,463 --> 01:24:13,197
I spent some time, I clearly
got a sense of the energy.

1872
01:24:13,197 --> 01:24:17,364
I've made a living by treating
my company like a family,

1873
01:24:18,477 --> 01:24:20,755
which means that you get all
the things that come along

1874
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:23,314
with a family, I've made less
money, I've got weirdness

1875
01:24:23,314 --> 01:24:25,435
of people that have been
with me for a long time

1876
01:24:25,435 --> 01:24:27,677
that are probably in bigger
spots than they deserve to.

1877
01:24:27,677 --> 01:24:29,802
When I start auditing
this company from afar,

1878
01:24:29,802 --> 01:24:34,015
the critiques that I would
have, I can't critique because

1879
01:24:34,015 --> 01:24:37,217
I'd be a hypocrite because
I do so many of them myself.

1880
01:24:37,217 --> 01:24:39,602
But as far as from the
marketing standpoint,

1881
01:24:39,602 --> 01:24:42,614
what you guys are doing on
Facebook, bigger marketing,

1882
01:24:42,614 --> 01:24:44,288
digital, things I could really help with,

1883
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:47,109
internally, operational,
I love all the strengths

1884
01:24:47,109 --> 01:24:49,202
and all the weaknesses, I
understand they just happen over

1885
01:24:49,202 --> 01:24:51,556
and you fixed those over
time, that's a commodity.

1886
01:24:51,556 --> 01:24:53,846
I don't have a sense of the marketing,

1887
01:24:53,846 --> 01:24:55,828
so in a world of shooting
it straight, the answer is

1888
01:24:55,828 --> 01:24:56,911
I don't know.

1889
01:24:58,637 --> 01:25:00,109
And that sucks, but that's true.

1890
01:25:00,109 --> 01:25:01,518
- [Audience Member] I respect that, Gary,

1891
01:25:01,518 --> 01:25:02,351
I respect that a lot.

1892
01:25:02,351 --> 01:25:04,184
- Cool man, thank you.

1893
01:25:09,984 --> 01:25:10,817
- Hey, Gary.

1894
01:25:10,817 --> 01:25:11,650
- [Gary] Hey man.

1895
01:25:11,650 --> 01:25:12,483
- I'm Logan.

1896
01:25:12,483 --> 01:25:13,316
- [Gary] Hey, Logan.

1897
01:25:13,316 --> 01:25:15,336
- Number two, I guess.

1898
01:25:15,336 --> 01:25:16,691
- [Gary] Number two as in
you're the second Logan

1899
01:25:16,691 --> 01:25:17,786
that spoke today?

1900
01:25:17,786 --> 01:25:20,094
- Actually, maybe the
third Logan, there's like

1901
01:25:20,094 --> 01:25:21,540
a couple of us.

1902
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:23,922
- [Gary] Who's Logan in here?

1903
01:25:23,922 --> 01:25:26,172
All right, Jesus, let's go.

1904
01:25:27,329 --> 01:25:30,662
- So, my first question of two, I assume

1905
01:25:31,534 --> 01:25:32,631
maybe you've taken a look at

1906
01:25:32,631 --> 01:25:34,452
some of our company's social?

1907
01:25:34,452 --> 01:25:35,573
- [Gary] Nope.

1908
01:25:35,573 --> 01:25:37,934
- So that's question is easy.

1909
01:25:37,934 --> 01:25:39,066
The second question--

1910
01:25:39,066 --> 01:25:41,277
- But I can tell you one
thing, because it doesn't

1911
01:25:41,277 --> 01:25:43,855
matter, you're not doing enough Instagram,

1912
01:25:43,855 --> 01:25:46,463
influencer marketing, you
should be the fucking farm on it

1913
01:25:46,463 --> 01:25:49,717
given the nature of the business, you can,

1914
01:25:49,717 --> 01:25:51,549
and you guys are West Coast.

1915
01:25:51,549 --> 01:25:55,253
You have to understand,
there's an alpha mom

1916
01:25:55,253 --> 01:25:59,623
in Tampa, Arizona that
you could give $50 to

1917
01:25:59,623 --> 01:26:01,979
or five free this or 10 free that,

1918
01:26:01,979 --> 01:26:04,432
or one month free this,
who's the alpha mom

1919
01:26:04,432 --> 01:26:07,396
of your entire five mile radius,

1920
01:26:07,396 --> 01:26:10,136
by her just giving you
love, three times on her

1921
01:26:10,136 --> 01:26:12,114
Instagram, it's gonna
disproportionately change

1922
01:26:12,114 --> 01:26:14,417
your business at a local micro level.

1923
01:26:14,417 --> 01:26:17,644
Multiply that by 74,000
humans and you change your

1924
01:26:17,644 --> 01:26:19,351
fucking business.

1925
01:26:19,351 --> 01:26:22,397
How the fuck do you think I got here?

1926
01:26:22,397 --> 01:26:24,324
Humans are amplifying my shit.

1927
01:26:24,324 --> 01:26:26,402
I do it two ways, I hack
attention and understand

1928
01:26:26,402 --> 01:26:29,761
where people pay attention,
and I do nice human things,

1929
01:26:29,761 --> 01:26:31,743
and I'm a good dude, and it
makes people want to talk

1930
01:26:31,743 --> 01:26:36,418
about me, and I'm smart as
fuck, charismatic as shit.

1931
01:26:36,418 --> 01:26:37,251
Go ahead.

1932
01:26:40,315 --> 01:26:41,579
- [Audience Member] So, I
still have two questions.

1933
01:26:41,579 --> 01:26:43,069
- Go ahead.

1934
01:26:43,069 --> 01:26:44,833
Respect, Logan, the third.

1935
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:47,757
- First question is we
have a social media account

1936
01:26:47,757 --> 01:26:51,218
times three, probably for
each thing, for almost

1937
01:26:51,218 --> 01:26:53,060
every location that we have.

1938
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:55,638
- [Gary] So, every location
has three different handles?

1939
01:26:55,638 --> 01:26:57,592
- No, every location has
a Facebook, Instagram,

1940
01:26:57,592 --> 01:26:59,360
Twitter and probably SnapChat.

1941
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,680
- [Gary] Okay.

1942
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:01,809
- I was curious about your thoughts.

1943
01:27:01,809 --> 01:27:02,642
- I like it.

1944
01:27:02,642 --> 01:27:05,592
If you're doing anything with it.

1945
01:27:05,592 --> 01:27:10,042
Like, having one, for this
location and it's somebody's

1946
01:27:10,042 --> 01:27:13,212
fifth job who's also on
shift and does it once

1947
01:27:13,212 --> 01:27:15,129
in a while, that's bad.

1948
01:27:16,135 --> 01:27:18,489
But if it's actually being run, it's good.

1949
01:27:18,489 --> 01:27:22,284
It's like, what's the ROI
of having an Instagram

1950
01:27:22,284 --> 01:27:24,939
handle for every account?

1951
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:27,815
It's the same question of
the ROI of a basketball,

1952
01:27:27,815 --> 01:27:31,225
for me, zero, for LeBron, a billion.

1953
01:27:31,225 --> 01:27:34,021
If a location uses those
four things properly,

1954
01:27:34,021 --> 01:27:35,442
they're gonna get ROI.

1955
01:27:35,442 --> 01:27:37,661
I don't think it confuses the market,

1956
01:27:37,661 --> 01:27:39,600
I'm not one of these people
that thinks just the main

1957
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,315
handle should do all the work.

1958
01:27:41,315 --> 01:27:43,822
They should work hand-in-hand
because you could do

1959
01:27:43,822 --> 01:27:46,193
different things because the local context

1960
01:27:46,193 --> 01:27:49,363
of a single location can
reference the high school

1961
01:27:49,363 --> 01:27:53,782
football games victory,
and that's how I see it.

1962
01:27:53,782 --> 01:27:57,068
You can't give it to
Sally on her fourth job,

1963
01:27:57,068 --> 01:28:00,318
to do in-between, you've got to invest.

1964
01:28:01,553 --> 01:28:02,386
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

1965
01:28:02,386 --> 01:28:03,219
- You're welcome.

1966
01:28:03,219 --> 01:28:05,008
- Second question, you just
got done with Tony Robins

1967
01:28:05,008 --> 01:28:06,362
and Wim Hof, is that right?

1968
01:28:06,362 --> 01:28:07,195
- [Gary] Yes.

1969
01:28:07,195 --> 01:28:08,706
- I was curious as to
what your biggest takeaway

1970
01:28:08,706 --> 01:28:11,426
from that whole experience was,
working with those two guys?

1971
01:28:11,426 --> 01:28:13,680
- We didn't see each other
because everybody is flying

1972
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:14,888
in and flying out.

1973
01:28:14,888 --> 01:28:17,776
So, my biggest takeaway
was we're busy as fuck

1974
01:28:17,776 --> 01:28:20,193
and we didn't see each other.

1975
01:28:24,814 --> 01:28:26,036
Hey man.

1976
01:28:26,036 --> 01:28:28,495
- So, how would you define
success and I can expand

1977
01:28:28,495 --> 01:28:29,632
on that if you need.

1978
01:28:29,632 --> 01:28:31,856
- Sure, my first answer to
that is doing what you want

1979
01:28:31,856 --> 01:28:34,265
every single day of your life.

1980
01:28:34,265 --> 01:28:35,901
Right?

1981
01:28:35,901 --> 01:28:37,779
And again, this has been the theme today,

1982
01:28:37,779 --> 01:28:41,280
if that is to be a part
of 17 softball teams,

1983
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,401
mazel tov!

1984
01:28:42,401 --> 01:28:44,735
If that is trying to buy the Jets, great.

1985
01:28:44,735 --> 01:28:49,048
To me, I lived 11 years
or so of my life waking up

1986
01:28:49,048 --> 01:28:52,223
every morning up sick because
I didn't want to go to school.

1987
01:28:52,223 --> 01:28:53,491
I didn't want to do that.

1988
01:28:53,491 --> 01:28:54,481
I remember what it feels like.

1989
01:28:54,481 --> 01:28:58,564
This time of year, fall,
I love the Jets so much,

1990
01:28:59,779 --> 01:29:03,628
right, that I was pumped, but
Sunday nights were the worst,

1991
01:29:03,628 --> 01:29:05,723
knowing that the next
day was the start of this

1992
01:29:05,723 --> 01:29:08,974
terrible fucking week
that I fucking hated.

1993
01:29:08,974 --> 01:29:13,107
Now, to wake up, I'm
fucking on vacation always.

1994
01:29:13,107 --> 01:29:15,346
I can wake up every day,
fucking fired up, right?

1995
01:29:15,346 --> 01:29:17,042
So, being able to do what
you want, when you want,

1996
01:29:17,042 --> 01:29:19,015
and it doesn't take a
lot of money to do that,

1997
01:29:19,015 --> 01:29:20,867
people are very confused
how much money it takes

1998
01:29:20,867 --> 01:29:23,651
to do what you want, how you
want, it's that you don't

1999
01:29:23,651 --> 01:29:26,030
know how to spend your
money in the right places,

2000
01:29:26,030 --> 01:29:27,813
so that you're like, fuck, I need 300,000,

2001
01:29:27,813 --> 01:29:29,968
you don't need 300,000, you
need to figure yourself out

2002
01:29:29,968 --> 01:29:31,893
and put yourself in a position to succeed.

2003
01:29:31,893 --> 01:29:34,198
But that's the answer, do
what you want every day.

2004
01:29:34,198 --> 01:29:35,183
- Awesome.

2005
01:29:35,183 --> 01:29:37,374
One other thing, as far
as relationships go,

2006
01:29:37,374 --> 01:29:41,230
you kind of focus on
your own opinion first,

2007
01:29:41,230 --> 01:29:42,837
how does that keep you
connected with people?

2008
01:29:42,837 --> 01:29:46,810
- Easy, my selflessness
comes from my selfishness.

2009
01:29:46,810 --> 01:29:49,891
Right, if you talk to the
people around me, I'm the best

2010
01:29:49,891 --> 01:29:52,096
because I'm in the
giving game at all times,

2011
01:29:52,096 --> 01:29:55,791
I've got a couple of things
that I have to do for myself,

2012
01:29:55,791 --> 01:29:59,958
but once you're good, your
connections are better.

2013
01:30:00,944 --> 01:30:03,611
People are confused,
you have to go selfish

2014
01:30:03,611 --> 01:30:06,480
to get yourself right
because once you're right,

2015
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:09,169
all you're doing is giving and
everybody is fucking pumped.

2016
01:30:09,169 --> 01:30:11,347
And then all you have to do
is to make sure that the thing

2017
01:30:11,347 --> 01:30:13,449
that you're selfish about
isn't something that breaks

2018
01:30:13,449 --> 01:30:16,701
one of those seven people, right?

2019
01:30:16,701 --> 01:30:18,727
You just got to make sure
those things you're selfish

2020
01:30:18,727 --> 01:30:22,278
about are the things that
your partner can deal with,

2021
01:30:22,278 --> 01:30:23,780
whether that's being a workaholic,

2022
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:25,695
whether that's being
home, whether that's being

2023
01:30:25,695 --> 01:30:27,861
into golf, and you've got
to golf every Saturday,

2024
01:30:27,861 --> 01:30:29,581
it can be a million little weird things.

2025
01:30:29,581 --> 01:30:31,779
You just got to make sure
that's okay with the other

2026
01:30:31,779 --> 01:30:34,753
person, that's where
people have disconnects.

2027
01:30:34,753 --> 01:30:39,260
Right, if we were all ripped
down to, you can only do

2028
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:42,066
these three things, we
could all get there,

2029
01:30:42,066 --> 01:30:44,179
and I would recommend
everybody to have a few lines

2030
01:30:44,179 --> 01:30:47,424
in the sand and then give
and that really creates

2031
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:49,424
the balance, you got it.

2032
01:30:50,602 --> 01:30:53,019
(applauding)

2033
01:30:54,589 --> 01:30:55,723
Hi.

2034
01:30:55,723 --> 01:30:59,890
- Hi, I'm Kaytlin from (mumbles).

2035
01:31:00,917 --> 01:31:03,029
So, I have a couple of bullet
points, I didn't want to

2036
01:31:03,029 --> 01:31:04,958
forget anything, so bear with me.

2037
01:31:04,958 --> 01:31:05,796
- [Gary] I'm ready.

2038
01:31:05,796 --> 01:31:09,574
- I 100% know what I want and
will accomplish with my life,

2039
01:31:09,574 --> 01:31:13,086
I want to impact the
world, people specifically,

2040
01:31:13,086 --> 01:31:16,640
massively and I'm not talking
about ripples or waves,

2041
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:19,973
it's like tsunamis, I want it to be big.

2042
01:31:21,929 --> 01:31:24,889
And I have my why, I know
why, I'm still figuring out

2043
01:31:24,889 --> 01:31:27,199
the how, that's something
I've been on for a little bit.

2044
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:28,997
- [Gary] What's the why?

2045
01:31:28,997 --> 01:31:30,044
- I love people.

2046
01:31:30,044 --> 01:31:32,095
I love people so much.

2047
01:31:32,095 --> 01:31:35,762
- I hate dogs because
I love people so much.

2048
01:31:39,792 --> 01:31:41,973
Dude, me and you, I love people so much,

2049
01:31:41,973 --> 01:31:45,890
I think the whole animal
thing, I'm weirded out

2050
01:31:46,922 --> 01:31:49,288
by this whole issue.

2051
01:31:49,288 --> 01:31:50,288
I hate dogs.

2052
01:31:51,923 --> 01:31:53,784
Super-unpopular, people
are freaking out right now,

2053
01:31:53,784 --> 01:31:55,762
seven people were just
like, I fucking loved

2054
01:31:55,762 --> 01:31:57,008
this guy until that moment.

2055
01:31:57,008 --> 01:31:59,251
Fuck that dude, people
love fucking animals,

2056
01:31:59,251 --> 01:32:01,705
I don't know, I just love people so much,

2057
01:32:01,705 --> 01:32:05,270
that it makes me weird against
animals for some reason.

2058
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:08,121
Not that I want to kick a dog, but fuck,

2059
01:32:08,121 --> 01:32:09,944
I just wish people would
like people a little bit more

2060
01:32:09,944 --> 01:32:12,777
instead of their fluffy schnauzer.

2061
01:32:16,416 --> 01:32:17,393
- [Audience Member] Anyways.

2062
01:32:17,393 --> 01:32:18,610
- Yeah, sorry.

2063
01:32:18,610 --> 01:32:21,571
- So, also, what really
fascinates me because I love

2064
01:32:21,571 --> 01:32:23,743
people so much and you do
too, I have no idea how you

2065
01:32:23,743 --> 01:32:26,115
could say, fuck it, I don't
care, that's something that

2066
01:32:26,115 --> 01:32:27,523
super-duper fascinates me.

2067
01:32:27,523 --> 01:32:30,695
- And honestly, maybe
that's the thing, right?

2068
01:32:30,695 --> 01:32:32,724
Because I think what allows me to deal

2069
01:32:32,724 --> 01:32:34,574
with every single day, people are like,

2070
01:32:34,574 --> 01:32:36,358
you're a charlatan, you're
full of shit, you're

2071
01:32:36,358 --> 01:32:38,451
snake oil salesman, you
suck, your daddy gave

2072
01:32:38,451 --> 01:32:41,202
you a liquor store, they
don't know my story.

2073
01:32:41,202 --> 01:32:44,813
So, I think the reason I can deal with it,

2074
01:32:44,813 --> 01:32:48,488
the reason I can love so
much is I don't care so much

2075
01:32:48,488 --> 01:32:49,595
'cause I know who I am.

2076
01:32:49,595 --> 01:32:51,490
When people try to troll me and be like,

2077
01:32:51,490 --> 01:32:53,803
easy for you to say, daddy
gave you a liquor store,

2078
01:32:53,803 --> 01:32:56,649
they don't know the truth
which is that I gave up 13

2079
01:32:56,649 --> 01:33:00,047
of my best years of my life to
build my dad's store for him

2080
01:33:00,047 --> 01:33:02,244
and I left at 36 years old
with no fucking collateral

2081
01:33:02,244 --> 01:33:06,077
value and no money in
the bank, starting over.

2082
01:33:07,205 --> 01:33:08,136
But what am I gonna do?

2083
01:33:08,136 --> 01:33:10,113
Spend all my time replying to everybody?

2084
01:33:10,113 --> 01:33:11,142
What am I gonna do?

2085
01:33:11,142 --> 01:33:13,449
Go on fucking TV and say, that's my story?

2086
01:33:13,449 --> 01:33:16,882
- What about, you said, even
your sister, your girlfriend

2087
01:33:16,882 --> 01:33:17,715
saying--

2088
01:33:17,715 --> 01:33:20,671
- [Gary] I'm married now, let's
not talk about girlfriends.

2089
01:33:20,671 --> 01:33:21,703
- But how do you say I
don't care about that too.

2090
01:33:21,703 --> 01:33:22,661
Sorry, it was only--

2091
01:33:22,661 --> 01:33:23,913
- I'm kidding.

2092
01:33:23,913 --> 01:33:27,142
I don't care because I know
where they're coming from.

2093
01:33:27,142 --> 01:33:28,949
Everybody is coming from a perspective,

2094
01:33:28,949 --> 01:33:31,058
I deploy empathy and I know
why my sister thinks that,

2095
01:33:31,058 --> 01:33:32,608
I know why my wife thinks that,

2096
01:33:32,608 --> 01:33:33,843
I know why my mom thinks that.

2097
01:33:33,843 --> 01:33:35,164
- [Audience Member] You don't
worry if they're disappointed?

2098
01:33:35,164 --> 01:33:36,372
Or not happy with your decision?

2099
01:33:36,372 --> 01:33:40,556
- I only care if I'm
doing something wrong.

2100
01:33:40,556 --> 01:33:42,222
Wrong is different than
doing something that somebody

2101
01:33:42,222 --> 01:33:44,555
else doesn't want you to do.

2102
01:33:46,027 --> 01:33:47,397
That's very different.

2103
01:33:47,397 --> 01:33:51,053
I worry if I hurt somebody or
try to do something malicious.

2104
01:33:51,053 --> 01:33:53,040
I'm only trying to do good, so it makes me

2105
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:56,519
very appeased with myself and
sometimes that means I have

2106
01:33:56,519 --> 01:33:58,533
to be selfish for a moment,
but I know what my macro

2107
01:33:58,533 --> 01:34:00,346
effect is, and if you want
to build a fucking tsunami,

2108
01:34:00,346 --> 01:34:02,215
you better fucking figure
out how to get real selfish

2109
01:34:02,215 --> 01:34:05,134
real fast, because if you
look at Gandhi or M. L. K.

2110
01:34:05,134 --> 01:34:10,026
or anybody else, they're the
most selfish fuckers going.

2111
01:34:10,026 --> 01:34:11,840
I'm serious.

2112
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:13,663
Go break that down.

2113
01:34:13,663 --> 01:34:17,169
This dude is dying laughing, brother,

2114
01:34:17,169 --> 01:34:18,857
I'm telling you, if you go look at them,

2115
01:34:18,857 --> 01:34:21,557
you start realizing that they
were selfish about having

2116
01:34:21,557 --> 01:34:25,856
a legacy and figured out
the code if they're giving

2117
01:34:25,856 --> 01:34:28,715
at all times and everybody knows about it,

2118
01:34:28,715 --> 01:34:31,102
that's going to build a legacy.

2119
01:34:31,102 --> 01:34:32,789
I know why I'm standing here today,

2120
01:34:32,789 --> 01:34:35,439
and I'm getting paid
unbelievably, but it's not ROI

2121
01:34:35,439 --> 01:34:38,567
positive to me, I could
make more money other ways,

2122
01:34:38,567 --> 01:34:42,194
it's why I'm going overtime,
because I know I have a little

2123
01:34:42,194 --> 01:34:44,365
more time than normal,
and I want to keep going,

2124
01:34:44,365 --> 01:34:46,806
and I know in the last 20
minutes, there's one answer,

2125
01:34:46,806 --> 01:34:49,749
two answers, it's gonna matter,
it's gonna build legacy.

2126
01:34:49,749 --> 01:34:51,987
You better get real fucking
selfish 'cause you're

2127
01:34:51,987 --> 01:34:54,296
not gonna have a ripple,
you're gonna have nothing

2128
01:34:54,296 --> 01:34:57,850
because you won't be strong
enough to deal with it.

2129
01:34:57,850 --> 01:35:00,618
Everybody likes the come up,
everybody wants to be big,

2130
01:35:00,618 --> 01:35:03,579
you don't know what
happens when that happens.

2131
01:35:03,579 --> 01:35:05,322
You got to be strong.

2132
01:35:05,322 --> 01:35:06,553
You don't know what happens
when you get the fucking

2133
01:35:06,553 --> 01:35:07,970
other side of it.

2134
01:35:09,675 --> 01:35:10,508
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

2135
01:35:10,508 --> 01:35:11,768
- You're welcome.

2136
01:35:11,768 --> 01:35:12,601
- [Audience Member] It was really helpful.

2137
01:35:12,601 --> 01:35:13,434
- You're welcome.

2138
01:35:13,434 --> 01:35:14,267
- That wasn't my question, though.

2139
01:35:14,267 --> 01:35:16,617
This will be fast, I promise
guy, I promise so much.

2140
01:35:16,617 --> 01:35:20,231
So, I know how I said, I'm
still figuring out the how,

2141
01:35:20,231 --> 01:35:22,073
I don't want to be stuck
figuring out the how and not

2142
01:35:22,073 --> 01:35:26,051
thinking about the next step,
and in order to accomplish

2143
01:35:26,051 --> 01:35:29,978
something that huge of life
purpose, I have to have

2144
01:35:29,978 --> 01:35:32,524
some key components, what are those?

2145
01:35:32,524 --> 01:35:35,849
- The first thing you need
to have is what do you have

2146
01:35:35,849 --> 01:35:36,682
to give?

2147
01:35:39,314 --> 01:35:41,301
- [Audience Member] So, once
I figure out the how, then--

2148
01:35:41,301 --> 01:35:43,756
- You can't figure out the how, for me,

2149
01:35:43,756 --> 01:35:46,249
once I figured out that
I understood how to build

2150
01:35:46,249 --> 01:35:48,831
businesses and that
entrepreneurship was a gateway

2151
01:35:48,831 --> 01:35:51,709
to the outcome for so
many people because it was

2152
01:35:51,709 --> 01:35:54,951
independence, I spent 15
years of my life building

2153
01:35:54,951 --> 01:35:57,181
a business, to have
then credibility to talk

2154
01:35:57,181 --> 01:35:59,425
about building a business, right?

2155
01:35:59,425 --> 01:36:01,017
Which gave people more
confidence to look and listen

2156
01:36:01,017 --> 01:36:03,927
to me, because if you're
a 20-year-old life coach

2157
01:36:03,927 --> 01:36:06,138
on Instagram, you're gonna
be faced with cynicism

2158
01:36:06,138 --> 01:36:08,872
because you're 20 years old.

2159
01:36:08,872 --> 01:36:11,050
So, I think the thing that
you have to figure out

2160
01:36:11,050 --> 01:36:13,143
is what do you have to give.

2161
01:36:13,143 --> 01:36:15,143
I've confidence to give.

2162
01:36:15,996 --> 01:36:17,586
Got it?

2163
01:36:17,586 --> 01:36:20,054
I'm up here, on full
fucking attack to inject you

2164
01:36:20,054 --> 01:36:22,473
with confidence and
eliminate insecurity which

2165
01:36:22,473 --> 01:36:24,846
leads to having very
difficult questions about how

2166
01:36:24,846 --> 01:36:28,065
you judge other people's
opinions in your inner circle,

2167
01:36:28,065 --> 01:36:29,535
that's how I got there.

2168
01:36:29,535 --> 01:36:31,374
I was like, wait a minute,
all of you aren't doing your

2169
01:36:31,374 --> 01:36:33,692
thing because your mom
parented you in a weird way,

2170
01:36:33,692 --> 01:36:36,477
'cause she was miserable
and misery loves company,

2171
01:36:36,477 --> 01:36:38,817
so she tried to make you
feel insecure 'cause she was

2172
01:36:38,817 --> 01:36:41,096
insecure and that's why
you're not confident,

2173
01:36:41,096 --> 01:36:42,962
and that's why you're not
doing shit and that leads

2174
01:36:42,962 --> 01:36:47,129
to you got to go confront
your mom and that's like fuck!

2175
01:36:47,991 --> 01:36:49,795
That's what I have to
give, that confidence

2176
01:36:49,795 --> 01:36:52,627
and self-esteem was my drug
that allowed me to open up

2177
01:36:52,627 --> 01:36:54,825
my opportunities which
led to awareness because

2178
01:36:54,825 --> 01:36:56,731
I was never scared to taste
shit and I figured out

2179
01:36:56,731 --> 01:36:58,597
what I was good at because I
never cared what you thought

2180
01:36:58,597 --> 01:37:02,011
about my shortcomings because
they were my shortcomings.

2181
01:37:02,011 --> 01:37:03,939
You have to figure out
what you have to give.

2182
01:37:03,939 --> 01:37:04,772
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

2183
01:37:04,772 --> 01:37:06,272
- You're welcome.

2184
01:37:12,108 --> 01:37:12,941
- [Audience Member] What's up, dude?

2185
01:37:12,941 --> 01:37:14,191
- What up, bro?

2186
01:37:15,964 --> 01:37:19,728
- I love the passion that you
bring, it's super-inspiring,

2187
01:37:19,728 --> 01:37:21,548
I wish some day I could
have the same amount.

2188
01:37:21,548 --> 01:37:22,381
- [Gary] Thanks.

2189
01:37:22,381 --> 01:37:24,286
- But I listened to a lot of your stuff,

2190
01:37:24,286 --> 01:37:28,838
and I want almost the help
of reconciling of a lot

2191
01:37:28,838 --> 01:37:32,081
of things you say, sometimes
I feel like they contradict

2192
01:37:32,081 --> 01:37:32,942
other things.

2193
01:37:32,942 --> 01:37:34,291
- [Gary] They always contradict.

2194
01:37:34,291 --> 01:37:35,817
- Perfect.

2195
01:37:35,817 --> 01:37:36,951
So, earlier you were saying--

2196
01:37:36,951 --> 01:37:38,591
- The whole conversation
we've been talking about today

2197
01:37:38,591 --> 01:37:42,289
is listen to nobody, listen to everybody.

2198
01:37:42,289 --> 01:37:43,876
- [Audience Member] Yes.

2199
01:37:43,876 --> 01:37:46,718
- Have you been following along at home?

2200
01:37:46,718 --> 01:37:49,318
Go reconcile that shit.

2201
01:37:49,318 --> 01:37:50,295
Go ahead.

2202
01:37:50,295 --> 01:37:52,613
Can I tell you, you know
where I figured something out,

2203
01:37:52,613 --> 01:37:53,709
I'm gonna try to go there.

2204
01:37:53,709 --> 01:37:57,174
I figured out, you know, I'm
reading every one of these

2205
01:37:57,174 --> 01:37:58,432
comments, right?

2206
01:37:58,432 --> 01:38:00,281
So I'm like, fuck, it is a contradiction,

2207
01:38:00,281 --> 01:38:01,959
I'm a contradiction, the fuck is this?

2208
01:38:01,959 --> 01:38:06,017
And I realized, oh,
because it's macro-micro.

2209
01:38:06,017 --> 01:38:08,772
On a micro, I listen to everybody,

2210
01:38:08,772 --> 01:38:11,341
on a macro I don't listen to anybody.

2211
01:38:11,341 --> 01:38:12,982
So, it sounds like a contradiction because

2212
01:38:12,982 --> 01:38:16,845
we think they're on the
same plane, but they're not.

2213
01:38:16,845 --> 01:38:21,418
Right, I hate selling, yet
I'm a big-time sales person,

2214
01:38:21,418 --> 01:38:25,177
it's 'cause I play
build-a-brand, so it comes to me,

2215
01:38:25,177 --> 01:38:27,759
not send them emails and be
like, hey you should book me,

2216
01:38:27,759 --> 01:38:30,912
it comes to me, macro branding,

2217
01:38:30,912 --> 01:38:33,862
so I don't have to micro-sell.

2218
01:38:33,862 --> 01:38:35,486
But go ahead.

2219
01:38:35,486 --> 01:38:38,110
- Earlier you were saying, the hustle--

2220
01:38:38,110 --> 01:38:40,990
- [Gary] Yes, work
ethic is fucking insane.

2221
01:38:40,990 --> 01:38:45,017
- Self-awareness, I would
say, situational awareness,

2222
01:38:45,017 --> 01:38:47,062
what everyone--

2223
01:38:47,062 --> 01:38:48,825
- [Gary] A 100%.

2224
01:38:48,825 --> 01:38:52,130
- And then, you also say that
we want to get technology

2225
01:38:52,130 --> 01:38:55,435
in kids' hands, I think
that limits work ethic

2226
01:38:55,435 --> 01:38:58,900
and they're not mature to
have situational awareness,

2227
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:01,381
that they ruin their
reputation and opportunity

2228
01:39:01,381 --> 01:39:04,103
for future, how to reconcile that?

2229
01:39:04,103 --> 01:39:08,111
- I think that's a romantic,
old, traditional man's

2230
01:39:08,111 --> 01:39:10,579
point of view that you've
absorbed and I don't know

2231
01:39:10,579 --> 01:39:14,547
why, but I couldn't
disagree with you more.

2232
01:39:14,547 --> 01:39:16,245
I think what you just said is what people

2233
01:39:16,245 --> 01:39:17,976
have been saying for throughout history

2234
01:39:17,976 --> 01:39:20,456
about every advancement in
technology and they're always

2235
01:39:20,456 --> 01:39:22,373
historically incorrect.

2236
01:39:23,353 --> 01:39:26,030
But I could be wrong, maybe you're right,

2237
01:39:26,030 --> 01:39:29,540
but I think that we are
very much shortsighted

2238
01:39:29,540 --> 01:39:31,863
on thinking about technology
because what we're

2239
01:39:31,863 --> 01:39:34,878
not recognizing is the
playing field of situational,

2240
01:39:34,878 --> 01:39:39,088
experiential, changes
what technologies impact.

2241
01:39:39,088 --> 01:39:42,921
I mean, for example, we
debate things based on

2242
01:39:43,980 --> 01:39:47,562
anti-technology, yet we put
other things on a pedestal

2243
01:39:47,562 --> 01:39:51,087
that do the same, aka,
we look down at texting

2244
01:39:51,087 --> 01:39:53,352
and writing to each other,
but if somebody writes us

2245
01:39:53,352 --> 01:39:55,618
a letter, we've now
put that on a pedestal,

2246
01:39:55,618 --> 01:39:57,520
even though it's the same exact thing,

2247
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:01,078
it's just a thing that's
delivering is different.

2248
01:40:01,078 --> 01:40:03,754
So, I don't know, I think
there's a lot of places

2249
01:40:03,754 --> 01:40:05,814
where I contradict, but on that one,

2250
01:40:05,814 --> 01:40:08,897
I think that, you know, we were told,

2251
01:40:10,383 --> 01:40:13,743
there's people in this
audience, mothers that were told

2252
01:40:13,743 --> 01:40:16,435
that Elvis was the devil
because he shook his hips

2253
01:40:16,435 --> 01:40:20,766
or the Beatles have long
hair, or Madonna this,

2254
01:40:20,766 --> 01:40:23,599
you know that's just defense, man.

2255
01:40:25,995 --> 01:40:30,368
By the way, if you hold on
to that, I'm talking some

2256
01:40:30,368 --> 01:40:31,796
because I want you to get
in here, I don't want it

2257
01:40:31,796 --> 01:40:35,678
to be just, 'cause I'm up
here, we also don't know.

2258
01:40:35,678 --> 01:40:37,489
And there's another
thing, we've been betting

2259
01:40:37,489 --> 01:40:40,957
against humans as humans
for a long time, we're still

2260
01:40:40,957 --> 01:40:45,515
standing, like I don't bet
against humans, we adjust.

2261
01:40:45,515 --> 01:40:47,755
Right, technology changes us.

2262
01:40:47,755 --> 01:40:50,038
Do you know what the
biggest fear in the world,

2263
01:40:50,038 --> 01:40:53,292
in society was, in the late 1800s?

2264
01:40:53,292 --> 01:40:54,709
The kaleidoscope.

2265
01:40:55,804 --> 01:40:57,299
Everything you just said,
you want to have a real

2266
01:40:57,299 --> 01:40:58,952
fucking funny thing, take
your phone out right now

2267
01:40:58,952 --> 01:41:01,876
and read about the dangers
of the kaleidoscope.

2268
01:41:01,876 --> 01:41:05,398
We are scared, we are scared,
and if I got my timing right,

2269
01:41:05,398 --> 01:41:07,481
I think it might be the
early 1900s, we are scared

2270
01:41:07,481 --> 01:41:10,605
that kids are looking at
technology too much and not

2271
01:41:10,605 --> 01:41:13,647
looking at the real world,
because the kaleidoscope

2272
01:41:13,647 --> 01:41:16,192
comes out and we're freaking
out and we're looking at it,

2273
01:41:16,192 --> 01:41:18,459
and it's so crazy, that people
are walking around London

2274
01:41:18,459 --> 01:41:22,126
and Paris, full time
because it was so pooh!

2275
01:41:23,742 --> 01:41:26,136
That's how I see phones
now, phones are making kids

2276
01:41:26,136 --> 01:41:29,710
more social, not less social,
it's giving plenty of people

2277
01:41:29,710 --> 01:41:33,121
courage that they didn't have
in real life and just because

2278
01:41:33,121 --> 01:41:36,608
it's not the way we grew up,
I don't see any romance of,

2279
01:41:36,608 --> 01:41:39,327
you have to go up to the
bar and ask a girl out,

2280
01:41:39,327 --> 01:41:41,081
that doesn't make you any more of a man,

2281
01:41:41,081 --> 01:41:43,748
you can slide in through the DM.

2282
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:49,280
- [Audience Member] That's awesome.

2283
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:52,499
- I think we've put things
in the past on a pedestal

2284
01:41:52,499 --> 01:41:55,404
because it's what we came up
with, you know what I mean?

2285
01:41:55,404 --> 01:41:58,404
That's what I think, you're welcome.

2286
01:42:01,005 --> 01:42:02,016
Yo.

2287
01:42:02,016 --> 01:42:02,849
- [Audience Member] What up, dude?

2288
01:42:02,849 --> 01:42:03,760
- What up, bro?

2289
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:07,022
- My name is Paul,
representing DB Sacramento,

2290
01:42:07,022 --> 01:42:08,445
I'm one of the managers over there.

2291
01:42:08,445 --> 01:42:10,789
- [Gary] Very nice.

2292
01:42:10,789 --> 01:42:12,861
- Aside from managing, I
have a little side hustle,

2293
01:42:12,861 --> 01:42:14,802
it's called Brosthetics Apparel.

2294
01:42:14,802 --> 01:42:16,006
- [Gary] Brosthetics.

2295
01:42:16,006 --> 01:42:18,755
- I started about two
years ago and Dutch Bros

2296
01:42:18,755 --> 01:42:20,752
have been super awesome
because they have been

2297
01:42:20,752 --> 01:42:22,194
super-supportive and they
have been really supporting

2298
01:42:22,194 --> 01:42:26,352
my passion, anyways, you
always talk a lot about

2299
01:42:26,352 --> 01:42:29,495
creating opportunity, and
making sure to be fearless,

2300
01:42:29,495 --> 01:42:32,280
it's always going to be
a no unless you try it.

2301
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:33,760
- [Gary] A 100%.

2302
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:36,560
- What I did, I actually
made four T-shirts for you,

2303
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:39,289
I made a Brosthetics
collab for the Gary V.

2304
01:42:39,289 --> 01:42:40,982
I did all the designing myself, printing

2305
01:42:40,982 --> 01:42:43,764
and I did it for my T-shirts
and I was wondering if I could

2306
01:42:43,764 --> 01:42:45,161
present this to you right now?

2307
01:42:45,161 --> 01:42:46,484
- Yes.

2308
01:42:46,484 --> 01:42:49,651
(audience applauding)

2309
01:42:58,231 --> 01:42:59,148
Who's next?

2310
01:43:10,437 --> 01:43:11,596
- You are so awesome, by the way.

2311
01:43:11,596 --> 01:43:12,596
- Thank you.

2312
01:43:14,256 --> 01:43:16,385
- So, I know how much you like the Jets,

2313
01:43:16,385 --> 01:43:19,290
so I had to do a little color scheme,

2314
01:43:19,290 --> 01:43:22,708
also I wanted to make sure
it's pretty presentable,

2315
01:43:22,708 --> 01:43:25,179
so I made a thermal, because
it's really cold over there.

2316
01:43:25,179 --> 01:43:26,458
- You mean in New York?

2317
01:43:26,458 --> 01:43:27,291
- Exactly.

2318
01:43:27,291 --> 01:43:28,158
- It's colder here.

2319
01:43:28,158 --> 01:43:29,023
- You wear V-necks.

2320
01:43:29,023 --> 01:43:30,243
- Yes, I wear this.

2321
01:43:30,243 --> 01:43:31,076
- Three-quarter sleeve.

2322
01:43:31,076 --> 01:43:31,909
- That's all right.

2323
01:43:31,909 --> 01:43:34,841
- And then plain through,
all of this is a really cool

2324
01:43:34,841 --> 01:43:37,087
like a swayed mixture, so to be honest,

2325
01:43:37,087 --> 01:43:38,096
if you like it.

2326
01:43:38,096 --> 01:43:39,253
- I'll wear it, I'll wear one.

2327
01:43:39,253 --> 01:43:41,525
- I appreciate it, thank you so much.

2328
01:43:41,525 --> 01:43:42,858
- D. Rock, come.

2329
01:43:49,415 --> 01:43:52,282
Thanks brother, appreciate it.

2330
01:43:52,282 --> 01:43:54,206
- Hey, Gary, my name is Carlos.

2331
01:43:54,206 --> 01:43:56,492
- [Gary] Carlos, your
hair is fucking awesome.

2332
01:43:56,492 --> 01:43:59,874
You said that, right, 'cause you're smart.

2333
01:43:59,874 --> 01:44:01,023
Go ahead, Carlos.

2334
01:44:01,023 --> 01:44:05,465
- I'm 18, I don't work here,
I completely snuck in here.

2335
01:44:05,465 --> 01:44:08,882
- [Gary] Let's clap it up for the hustle.

2336
01:44:10,529 --> 01:44:13,741
- I've been watching your
stuff for a long time,

2337
01:44:13,741 --> 01:44:16,601
you've motivated me a
lot, I've hustled a lot,

2338
01:44:16,601 --> 01:44:19,330
I've gone out, done social
media for different businesses,

2339
01:44:19,330 --> 01:44:23,351
done all that, I'm here
really just to ask you

2340
01:44:23,351 --> 01:44:26,419
if I could come to Vayner
Media with that other guy

2341
01:44:26,419 --> 01:44:28,223
on a plane, if you could give me a ticket,

2342
01:44:28,223 --> 01:44:32,050
if there's any way I could
talk to you or present

2343
01:44:32,050 --> 01:44:35,803
an idea, a music idea, we
have patents for and stuff

2344
01:44:35,803 --> 01:44:39,257
that you might be interested
in, kind of revolved around

2345
01:44:39,257 --> 01:44:42,151
making streaming music profitable.

2346
01:44:42,151 --> 01:44:43,406
- Okay, so let's do this.

2347
01:44:43,406 --> 01:44:45,946
I love to shoot it straight,
why don't you do this,

2348
01:44:45,946 --> 01:44:48,890
why don't you email me
first the framework,

2349
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:51,662
and then let me decide, right?

2350
01:44:51,662 --> 01:44:56,312
So, gary@vaynermedia,
Carlos dude with great hair

2351
01:44:56,312 --> 01:44:59,956
that snuck in, and then
just give me all the stuff

2352
01:44:59,956 --> 01:45:02,255
and I will reply to you within this week.

2353
01:45:02,255 --> 01:45:03,398
We'll start a relationship that way.

2354
01:45:03,398 --> 01:45:04,231
- [Audience Member] Thank you so much.

2355
01:45:04,231 --> 01:45:05,648
- You're welcome.

2356
01:45:10,346 --> 01:45:11,179
- [Audience Member] How's it going?

2357
01:45:11,179 --> 01:45:12,012
- Really good, man.

2358
01:45:12,012 --> 01:45:14,845
- Good, so I'm Patty from Covalis.

2359
01:45:16,671 --> 01:45:18,855
And as I came to speak for many of us,

2360
01:45:18,855 --> 01:45:21,838
we are college students
and our friends down at

2361
01:45:21,838 --> 01:45:23,598
UGNR as well.

2362
01:45:23,598 --> 01:45:26,733
- Hold on, hold on, you guys,
your bro gave me his shirt

2363
01:45:26,733 --> 01:45:29,363
and now you're fucking leaving?

2364
01:45:29,363 --> 01:45:30,196
Flight?

2365
01:45:31,654 --> 01:45:33,404
Let's boo these guys.

2366
01:45:35,126 --> 01:45:36,334
Awesome.

2367
01:45:36,334 --> 01:45:37,897
Thanks guys, have a good flight, be safe,

2368
01:45:37,897 --> 01:45:39,201
all right, go.

2369
01:45:39,201 --> 01:45:41,962
- Okay, so for a lot
of us college students.

2370
01:45:41,962 --> 01:45:44,796
- Let's boo them one more time.

2371
01:45:44,796 --> 01:45:47,296
All right, go ahead, go ahead.

2372
01:45:49,458 --> 01:45:50,654
College.

2373
01:45:50,654 --> 01:45:52,869
- College students, yeah,
we've got a long going on.

2374
01:45:52,869 --> 01:45:55,082
- [Gary] I mean, I don't
know if we got a lot

2375
01:45:55,082 --> 01:45:57,415
going on, bro, but go ahead.

2376
01:45:58,314 --> 01:45:59,963
Those are the best fucking
four years of your life,

2377
01:45:59,963 --> 01:46:02,204
you have nothing going on.

2378
01:46:02,204 --> 01:46:05,902
I mean, you do, but it's
still fucking a vacation.

2379
01:46:05,902 --> 01:46:08,735
- Yeah, okay, I'll give it to you.

2380
01:46:09,996 --> 01:46:13,986
If we're not pursuing
franchising, this job is--

2381
01:46:13,986 --> 01:46:14,819
- [Gary] A stepping stone.

2382
01:46:14,819 --> 01:46:15,841
- To the next place.

2383
01:46:15,841 --> 01:46:17,987
- Which by the way, the
more I'm getting educated,

2384
01:46:17,987 --> 01:46:19,126
I'm gonna do a little
more homework before I get

2385
01:46:19,126 --> 01:46:21,126
caught up in the whole
nature of it because I've got

2386
01:46:21,126 --> 01:46:23,272
my own version of that.

2387
01:46:23,272 --> 01:46:27,375
If this is what I think it
is, this is where people

2388
01:46:27,375 --> 01:46:28,675
should go for a stepping stone.

2389
01:46:28,675 --> 01:46:30,223
When you have an organization
that is supportive

2390
01:46:30,223 --> 01:46:34,390
of side hustle, like, cool
man, yes and you're lucky

2391
01:46:35,301 --> 01:46:37,372
that you stumbled into it
because a supportive stepping

2392
01:46:37,372 --> 01:46:39,298
stone is rare.

2393
01:46:39,298 --> 01:46:42,131
- Yeah (mumbles).

2394
01:46:44,792 --> 01:46:45,902
- By the way, it's just
smart for companies

2395
01:46:45,902 --> 01:46:48,674
because he knows, sorry
bro, we'll get to it,

2396
01:46:48,674 --> 01:46:52,566
but there's millions more behind you.

2397
01:46:52,566 --> 01:46:54,050
The reason they're supportive
is because it becomes

2398
01:46:54,050 --> 01:46:56,343
a deal flow, the reason I take
care of all of my employees

2399
01:46:56,343 --> 01:46:58,422
is because it makes 10 more
want to come in the door

2400
01:46:58,422 --> 01:46:59,933
once they know the truth.

2401
01:46:59,933 --> 01:47:03,646
Being supportive as an
employer is fucking practical,

2402
01:47:03,646 --> 01:47:05,765
it's actually smart.

2403
01:47:05,765 --> 01:47:09,593
It's unbelievable, it's basically
the thematic of everything

2404
01:47:09,593 --> 01:47:10,627
I've been talking about.

2405
01:47:10,627 --> 01:47:13,544
Positivity and offense always wins.

2406
01:47:14,465 --> 01:47:16,585
Historically, always.

2407
01:47:16,585 --> 01:47:17,418
Go ahead.

2408
01:47:20,149 --> 01:47:21,982
Just go ahead, go, go.

2409
01:47:27,775 --> 01:47:30,609
- So, also earlier we did an
exercise with the other speaker

2410
01:47:30,609 --> 01:47:32,791
about talking to someone
else about their weakness

2411
01:47:32,791 --> 01:47:34,691
and what they're not good
at and it came up again

2412
01:47:34,691 --> 01:47:37,287
and this is where I'm
gonna pose my question,

2413
01:47:37,287 --> 01:47:40,770
there's this inherited fear
of failing in your career,

2414
01:47:40,770 --> 01:47:43,913
your major, your degree,
your business, moving up

2415
01:47:43,913 --> 01:47:46,843
in Dutch Bros management,
whatever it may be for yourself,

2416
01:47:46,843 --> 01:47:49,365
what's your one liner
for just taking the leap

2417
01:47:49,365 --> 01:47:50,782
and going for it?

2418
01:47:52,698 --> 01:47:56,063
- You know, I hate repeating
myself, but I get it,

2419
01:47:56,063 --> 01:47:58,808
and I'll do it until the day I day.

2420
01:47:58,808 --> 01:48:01,160
Who are you afraid of, like what?

2421
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:05,301
What if you get fired
from Dutch Bros tomorrow?

2422
01:48:05,301 --> 01:48:08,968
Which I can see is
pretty much gonna happen.

2423
01:48:10,819 --> 01:48:14,319
When that happens, what are you scared of?

2424
01:48:15,277 --> 01:48:17,085
Your dad is gonna be like,
I told you you're a loser,

2425
01:48:17,085 --> 01:48:19,656
or your girl is like,
I can never trust you,

2426
01:48:19,656 --> 01:48:23,175
I can never marry you, like what?

2427
01:48:23,175 --> 01:48:26,675
It is a woo, tell me the thing, like what?

2428
01:48:29,371 --> 01:48:33,487
This is why I'm petrified of
fucking eight place trophies.

2429
01:48:33,487 --> 01:48:35,680
If you grew up where
everybody gets an eight place

2430
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:37,763
trophy, you're actually scared of losing

2431
01:48:37,763 --> 01:48:41,040
and then you're fucked
because losing is real.

2432
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:45,207
I swear on my fucking kids'
health, I'm obsessed with losing

2433
01:48:46,486 --> 01:48:48,438
and I fucking love losing.

2434
01:48:48,438 --> 01:48:50,025
I love losing because I
know exactly what you're

2435
01:48:50,025 --> 01:48:52,080
thinking about my loss and
I can't wait to stick it

2436
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:55,247
in your fucking face when I come back.

2437
01:49:02,544 --> 01:49:04,898
I remember once my grandma
said I was lazy because

2438
01:49:04,898 --> 01:49:07,669
after seven hours of fucking
dragging wood in my parents'

2439
01:49:07,669 --> 01:49:09,938
backyard, I was like, I need
a break, because she's old

2440
01:49:09,938 --> 01:49:13,626
school Russian gangster
and I remember laying there

2441
01:49:13,626 --> 01:49:15,675
and her drilling me and
me thinking to myself,

2442
01:49:15,675 --> 01:49:17,719
I'm gonna fucking stick it
to you grandma, like nobody

2443
01:49:17,719 --> 01:49:20,422
has ever, I like losing.

2444
01:49:20,422 --> 01:49:22,531
When the Yankees and Rangers
won their championships,

2445
01:49:22,531 --> 01:49:23,900
I stopped rooting for them.

2446
01:49:23,900 --> 01:49:25,684
People laugh at me,
like you're a Jets fan,

2447
01:49:25,684 --> 01:49:28,566
I love being a Jets fan, I
hate being a Sea Hawks fan

2448
01:49:28,566 --> 01:49:32,062
because you won, it's
over, the climb is over.

2449
01:49:32,062 --> 01:49:33,362
That's it.

2450
01:49:33,362 --> 01:49:37,677
What are you fucking fearful
of, your sister making fun

2451
01:49:37,677 --> 01:49:39,287
of you because she's got a better job?

2452
01:49:39,287 --> 01:49:40,120
Fuck her.

2453
01:49:45,039 --> 01:49:46,727
That's my answer.

2454
01:49:46,727 --> 01:49:50,754
Cool, don't forget my
friends, you could be winning

2455
01:49:50,754 --> 01:49:54,050
28-nothing at half time and lose.

2456
01:49:54,050 --> 01:49:56,704
So, your older sibling that's
got a great fucking job,

2457
01:49:56,704 --> 01:49:59,287
could be a crackhead next year.

2458
01:50:01,137 --> 01:50:04,745
Could, could, because he's
had a whole facade the whole

2459
01:50:04,745 --> 01:50:09,423
time of trying to suck
your parents' dick, right?

2460
01:50:09,423 --> 01:50:12,276
And he's actually insecure
inside and something went wrong

2461
01:50:12,276 --> 01:50:15,760
at the office and he starts
doing coke on the side,

2462
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:19,403
guys, don't you understand
how this is being played?

2463
01:50:19,403 --> 01:50:21,812
This is real, I'm being serious.

2464
01:50:21,812 --> 01:50:23,446
Who gives a shit if you're
losing when you're in college,

2465
01:50:23,446 --> 01:50:26,860
you've got 80 fucking years
to stick it to them, bro.

2466
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:29,360
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

2467
01:50:31,684 --> 01:50:35,660
- I actually have a whole
different new concept,

2468
01:50:35,660 --> 01:50:39,827
I recommend fucking up on
purpose, I'm being serious,

2469
01:50:40,794 --> 01:50:45,168
it's so much better to eliminate
expectations from the get.

2470
01:50:45,168 --> 01:50:48,036
Then you're playing with
house money, if you're scared

2471
01:50:48,036 --> 01:50:50,402
of other people's opinion,
you fuck up on purpose,

2472
01:50:50,402 --> 01:50:51,693
then everybody thinks you suck shit,

2473
01:50:51,693 --> 01:50:53,443
then it's all upside.

2474
01:50:54,569 --> 01:50:58,236
I'm telling you, I'm
not joking, by the way,

2475
01:51:00,501 --> 01:51:02,405
actually, you know what's fucking weird?

2476
01:51:02,405 --> 01:51:04,403
This is what's fun about
talking, maybe that's what

2477
01:51:04,403 --> 01:51:07,699
happened to me, maybe
what happened to me was

2478
01:51:07,699 --> 01:51:09,936
because I got Ds and Fs
and every teacher and every

2479
01:51:09,936 --> 01:51:11,760
friend's parent thought I
was going to be a loser,

2480
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:14,748
because, how many people
are 40 years or older?

2481
01:51:14,748 --> 01:51:17,428
Raise your hands, good,
so for the few of us here,

2482
01:51:17,428 --> 01:51:20,616
education was the only thing,
there was no entrepreneurship

2483
01:51:20,616 --> 01:51:22,905
in the 80s, that wasn't a
conversation, I didn't even

2484
01:51:22,905 --> 01:51:23,959
know what the fucking word meant.

2485
01:51:23,959 --> 01:51:25,060
The first time I heard
it, it meant that you were

2486
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:27,504
kind of like a loser,
that didn't do anything,

2487
01:51:27,504 --> 01:51:30,297
maybe that's what happened to me.

2488
01:51:30,297 --> 01:51:32,300
Maybe the advice I'm giving
you man, is based on what

2489
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:36,292
happened to me, which was
because I sucked so bad at school

2490
01:51:36,292 --> 01:51:39,271
and that's the only way that
we were graded back then

2491
01:51:39,271 --> 01:51:41,916
that all expectations
were goose egg for me

2492
01:51:41,916 --> 01:51:44,954
and all of it was upside,
so I was liberated

2493
01:51:44,954 --> 01:51:47,504
to play in the fucking machine
and just went on straight

2494
01:51:47,504 --> 01:51:50,171
fucking offense and fucking won.

2495
01:51:51,354 --> 01:51:52,604
So, go fuck up.

2496
01:51:59,737 --> 01:52:01,415
Are we done?

2497
01:52:01,415 --> 01:52:02,980
Have we defeated the crowd?

2498
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:03,867
Oh, no.

2499
01:52:03,867 --> 01:52:05,361
Hey.

2500
01:52:05,361 --> 01:52:06,450
- Hey, Gary.

2501
01:52:06,450 --> 01:52:10,000
Oh, sorry, I'm a coach,
so I never have a voice.

2502
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,250
I'm from Bent, Oregon, this is my crew.

2503
01:52:14,329 --> 01:52:16,915
And I'm a mew assistant
manager in our franchise

2504
01:52:16,915 --> 01:52:19,631
and someone once on a podcast told me

2505
01:52:19,631 --> 01:52:21,565
the best thing you can do is find a person

2506
01:52:21,565 --> 01:52:23,811
who encourages you and inspires you

2507
01:52:23,811 --> 01:52:24,867
and just latch onto them.

2508
01:52:24,867 --> 01:52:28,247
And I definitely have a
(mumbles), but I'm wondering

2509
01:52:28,247 --> 01:52:30,404
who was yours, you're so
confident, so sure of yourself,

2510
01:52:30,404 --> 01:52:33,229
but when you were just
starting, who was it?

2511
01:52:33,229 --> 01:52:34,062
- [Gary] My mom.

2512
01:52:34,062 --> 01:52:34,895
- Your mom?

2513
01:52:34,895 --> 01:52:35,728
- [Gary] My mom.

2514
01:52:35,728 --> 01:52:36,782
- What did she do for you?

2515
01:52:36,782 --> 01:52:37,615
Everything?

2516
01:52:37,615 --> 01:52:40,998
- When I was nine years
old, and opened a door

2517
01:52:40,998 --> 01:52:43,715
for an elderly woman at a McDonalds,

2518
01:52:43,715 --> 01:52:48,230
she reacted as if I won
the Nobel Peace Prize.

2519
01:52:48,230 --> 01:52:49,227
- [Audience Member] Good mom.

2520
01:52:49,227 --> 01:52:52,229
- What my mom did was
super-smart, she overreacted

2521
01:52:52,229 --> 01:52:55,185
on everything that I was
doing, that was a good human

2522
01:52:55,185 --> 01:52:59,512
trait and she held me
accountable for things that

2523
01:52:59,512 --> 01:53:04,329
didn't matter, like grades,
I got punished four times

2524
01:53:04,329 --> 01:53:08,140
a year, every year, from the
time I was in third grade,

2525
01:53:08,140 --> 01:53:10,978
until my senior year of high school.

2526
01:53:10,978 --> 01:53:14,356
Literally, I would get my
report card, I would take it

2527
01:53:14,356 --> 01:53:17,611
out of the mail and
flush it down the toilet,

2528
01:53:17,611 --> 01:53:20,721
this is true, which would buy me a week,

2529
01:53:20,721 --> 01:53:24,210
then my sister finally broke
down and would tell on me,

2530
01:53:24,210 --> 01:53:27,974
I'd be punished for two
weeks, no TV, no Nintendo,

2531
01:53:27,974 --> 01:53:29,590
and we'd reset.

2532
01:53:29,590 --> 01:53:32,783
My mom built huge self-esteem
in me and I feel like

2533
01:53:32,783 --> 01:53:35,552
the biggest reason I am who
I am today, to everybody

2534
01:53:35,552 --> 01:53:39,547
is because I feel so guilty
and so grateful for what she

2535
01:53:39,547 --> 01:53:42,772
did for me, that I want to
do it for everybody else.

2536
01:53:42,772 --> 01:53:44,193
Which is, guess what?

2537
01:53:44,193 --> 01:53:47,369
You suck at a ton of shit,
good, so does everybody else,

2538
01:53:47,369 --> 01:53:49,854
you're also probably pretty
fucking rad at something,

2539
01:53:49,854 --> 01:53:52,013
try as many things as
possible, until you figure out

2540
01:53:52,013 --> 01:53:54,748
what you're rad at and you
like and go fucking do that

2541
01:53:54,748 --> 01:53:56,706
for the rest of your life
and stop giving a fuck

2542
01:53:56,706 --> 01:53:58,456
about everybody else.

2543
01:54:00,945 --> 01:54:02,735
- [Audience Member] That's awesome.

2544
01:54:02,735 --> 01:54:04,152
- Thanks, cheers.

2545
01:54:09,095 --> 01:54:09,928
Hey.

2546
01:54:09,928 --> 01:54:11,848
- Hi, I'm Val.

2547
01:54:11,848 --> 01:54:12,725
- [Gary] Hey, Val.

2548
01:54:12,725 --> 01:54:17,019
- I'm here with Dutch Bros,
I didn't sneak in, but--

2549
01:54:17,019 --> 01:54:19,461
- [Gary] But you're
keeping it pretty shady.

2550
01:54:19,461 --> 01:54:20,294
- What?

2551
01:54:20,294 --> 01:54:21,882
- [Gary] I don't know,
aren't you supposed to say,

2552
01:54:21,882 --> 01:54:25,480
I'm from Eugene, Oregon or something?

2553
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:26,397
- Let's go!

2554
01:54:27,242 --> 01:54:28,159
I'm actually--

2555
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:29,821
- [Gary] Corporate?

2556
01:54:29,821 --> 01:54:31,352
- What, no.

2557
01:54:31,352 --> 01:54:34,185
I'm here with Dutch Bros Rockland,

2558
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:37,182
formerly from DVAZ.

2559
01:54:40,490 --> 01:54:42,858
We're all family here.

2560
01:54:42,858 --> 01:54:44,344
- [Gary] Respect, go ahead.

2561
01:54:44,344 --> 01:54:47,500
- My question is for you,
with how busy you are,

2562
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:51,372
I'm sure you have set some
boundaries so that you spend

2563
01:54:51,372 --> 01:54:55,945
quality time with your
family, how do you disconnect?

2564
01:54:55,945 --> 01:54:57,375
- Easily.

2565
01:54:57,375 --> 01:55:01,542
Like, I'm aware that I
spend so much time doing me,

2566
01:55:02,711 --> 01:55:07,073
that it's hard, actually, I
say easily, that first day

2567
01:55:07,073 --> 01:55:10,791
is defragging, you're still on that drug

2568
01:55:10,791 --> 01:55:15,048
of adrenaline and working,
but it's so important to me

2569
01:55:15,048 --> 01:55:18,381
to win at extremities that I do my best.

2570
01:55:19,333 --> 01:55:23,964
I would say 80% of the
weekends or 80% of vacations

2571
01:55:23,964 --> 01:55:28,016
I'm good, I'm fucking there,
I'm in it, but 20% of time,

2572
01:55:28,016 --> 01:55:30,863
something just happened or
I'm hot on this wine club

2573
01:55:30,863 --> 01:55:33,057
that I'm building for my
dad, I'm just into it,

2574
01:55:33,057 --> 01:55:36,532
I miss wine, and so this August,
when I was with my family,

2575
01:55:36,532 --> 01:55:38,783
I probably did a little too
much wine club on the phone

2576
01:55:38,783 --> 01:55:41,516
when I should have
disconnected, but it's similar

2577
01:55:41,516 --> 01:55:43,524
to what I said, I don't judge myself.

2578
01:55:43,524 --> 01:55:46,622
I'm not gonna be perfect,
I'm trying really hard,

2579
01:55:46,622 --> 01:55:50,262
for all of us, some things
are better than others,

2580
01:55:50,262 --> 01:55:55,122
but in reality, I think I
owe it to the whole system.

2581
01:55:55,122 --> 01:55:58,881
Not just my kids and my wife,
I owe to the whole fucking

2582
01:55:58,881 --> 01:56:02,797
thing, to really work hard
at checking out and being

2583
01:56:02,797 --> 01:56:05,403
there, and I enjoy it.

2584
01:56:05,403 --> 01:56:09,709
I'm always into the jersey I'm
wearing, do I love my work,

2585
01:56:09,709 --> 01:56:10,973
does it come more natural?

2586
01:56:10,973 --> 01:56:13,589
It does, it is more natural
for me to work every day

2587
01:56:13,589 --> 01:56:16,969
for the rest of my life,
it's my zone, it just is,

2588
01:56:16,969 --> 01:56:19,598
it is what it is, it's the truth.

2589
01:56:19,598 --> 01:56:21,883
But especially my kids
are now eight and five,

2590
01:56:21,883 --> 01:56:24,101
so now they're like actually real.

2591
01:56:24,101 --> 01:56:25,883
When they were that little,
I'm like, fuck that,

2592
01:56:25,883 --> 01:56:29,339
but when they become real
and they can say shit

2593
01:56:29,339 --> 01:56:30,533
and now my daughter is like me,

2594
01:56:30,533 --> 01:56:32,169
and I'm like, fuck, she's
like me, a girl version,

2595
01:56:32,169 --> 01:56:33,357
fuck that's gonna be crazy.

2596
01:56:33,357 --> 01:56:37,357
So, so, I enjoy it and
it's getting even better.

2597
01:56:39,310 --> 01:56:41,494
For me, and everybody is
different, as they're getting

2598
01:56:41,494 --> 01:56:43,737
older, it's even more fun
and then carving out more

2599
01:56:43,737 --> 01:56:44,825
time with my wife.

2600
01:56:44,825 --> 01:56:46,494
I'm back to Jewish
holidays, I text my wife

2601
01:56:46,494 --> 01:56:48,500
on the air, I'm so pumped
for Yom Kippur because

2602
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:51,072
we can't do shit, we're just
gonna hug and lay together.

2603
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:55,164
And I'm trying the best I can,
too many people are letting

2604
01:56:55,164 --> 01:56:58,236
other people judge their
parenting and relationships.

2605
01:56:58,236 --> 01:57:00,728
This all comes down to
the same shit, right?

2606
01:57:00,728 --> 01:57:03,886
People are allowing other
people to tell them how to

2607
01:57:03,886 --> 01:57:07,758
parent, which is fucking
ludicrous because whatever

2608
01:57:07,758 --> 01:57:11,404
is politically correct
now isn't going to be.

2609
01:57:11,404 --> 01:57:14,819
I promise you, the way of,
oh shit, they did it right

2610
01:57:14,819 --> 01:57:17,112
in the 60s, divide and
conquer is gonna be super hot

2611
01:57:17,112 --> 01:57:17,945
in 2020.

2612
01:57:20,259 --> 01:57:22,691
So, I'm not relying on
everybody else telling me how

2613
01:57:22,691 --> 01:57:25,282
to do it, I'm gonna do it
the way that feels right

2614
01:57:25,282 --> 01:57:28,515
for me, my spouse and
my kids and every day.

2615
01:57:28,515 --> 01:57:30,884
If I walk into the house
tomorrow and my little guy goes,

2616
01:57:30,884 --> 01:57:33,950
you travel too much, I
hate it, I will adjust,

2617
01:57:33,950 --> 01:57:36,398
if I feel like I have to.

2618
01:57:36,398 --> 01:57:38,544
If it hurts, then I'll adjust.

2619
01:57:38,544 --> 01:57:41,185
Actions, back to the dude
about the weakness and story,

2620
01:57:41,185 --> 01:57:43,226
words are bullshit.

2621
01:57:43,226 --> 01:57:47,212
Actions, I took most of
August off, that's an action.

2622
01:57:47,212 --> 01:57:50,299
I just did, I took
fucking 28 days in a row,

2623
01:57:50,299 --> 01:57:51,894
that's more days than
what I took in my entire

2624
01:57:51,894 --> 01:57:54,728
20s combined off, not natural
for me, but it's actions

2625
01:57:54,728 --> 01:57:58,635
and so just hacking, hacking every day.

2626
01:57:58,635 --> 01:57:59,511
- [Audience Member] Awesome, thank you.

2627
01:57:59,511 --> 01:58:00,992
- Welcome.

2628
01:58:00,992 --> 01:58:03,159
Vera, can I say some shit?

2629
01:58:05,008 --> 01:58:07,852
He's adjusting, I saw you
on the phone with Taylor,

2630
01:58:07,852 --> 01:58:08,965
is he freaking?

2631
01:58:08,965 --> 01:58:09,798
Good.

2632
01:58:09,798 --> 01:58:13,792
All right, hey, who's up, oh sorry, bro.

2633
01:58:13,792 --> 01:58:14,896
- [Audience Member]
What's up, Gary, I'm Matt.

2634
01:58:14,896 --> 01:58:15,729
- Matt.

2635
01:58:15,729 --> 01:58:19,646
- I'm over here with DVTC
from Caldwell, Idaho.

2636
01:58:21,638 --> 01:58:25,552
So, I'm kind of, first off,
your energy, incredible.

2637
01:58:25,552 --> 01:58:26,473
- [Gary] Thanks, bro.

2638
01:58:26,473 --> 01:58:29,122
- Dude, we do this every
day, we get to vibe with you,

2639
01:58:29,122 --> 01:58:31,553
thank you for coming out here.

2640
01:58:31,553 --> 01:58:35,376
Also, going back to Logan
the Third, his marketing

2641
01:58:35,376 --> 01:58:39,774
and social media, you
mentioned investing into that.

2642
01:58:39,774 --> 01:58:43,782
What are some specifics,
that we could do money,

2643
01:58:43,782 --> 01:58:47,145
do we need a specific person for it?

2644
01:58:47,145 --> 01:58:48,787
What are some big--

2645
01:58:48,787 --> 01:58:50,441
- I think you can hire
some, where are you guys,

2646
01:58:50,441 --> 01:58:51,503
Colorado you said?

2647
01:58:51,503 --> 01:58:53,021
- [Audience Member] Caldwell, Idaho.

2648
01:58:53,021 --> 01:58:55,945
- I think for $27,000 a year
you can get a full-time person

2649
01:58:55,945 --> 01:58:57,481
that fucking dominates.

2650
01:58:57,481 --> 01:59:00,869
Now, here's the
vulnerability, who's the judge

2651
01:59:00,869 --> 01:59:04,513
of the person if they're good or not.

2652
01:59:04,513 --> 01:59:07,182
So, if you run your shit,
the key is that you know

2653
01:59:07,182 --> 01:59:09,094
so that you can judge.

2654
01:59:09,094 --> 01:59:11,911
Too many people outsource
their social or anything,

2655
01:59:11,911 --> 01:59:14,219
their finances, they
outsource to other people

2656
01:59:14,219 --> 01:59:16,210
because they don't want to
do it or they don't know how

2657
01:59:16,210 --> 01:59:18,515
and that's what gets them in trouble.

2658
01:59:18,515 --> 01:59:22,538
So I think at that price
point, I think there's

2659
01:59:22,538 --> 01:59:25,375
plenty of 22-year-olds
that know what to do,

2660
01:59:25,375 --> 01:59:29,274
I was one, but I also think
there's far more that don't,

2661
01:59:29,274 --> 01:59:31,395
but look the part because they're young.

2662
01:59:31,395 --> 01:59:33,250
And there may be a
47-year-old that knows exactly

2663
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:37,477
what to do, so I think,
whoever is the judge and jury

2664
01:59:37,477 --> 01:59:41,375
of the person who's
managing, has to be capable

2665
01:59:41,375 --> 01:59:43,175
of understanding what the result is,

2666
01:59:43,175 --> 01:59:45,720
and the result is not
likes and the result is not

2667
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:48,308
followers, I don't think
you're paying your dues

2668
01:59:48,308 --> 01:59:50,814
with likes, you don't take likes, right?

2669
01:59:50,814 --> 01:59:54,814
So this is the business
mind, a lot of people on

2670
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:57,739
social media, in the beginning,
they played on vanity

2671
01:59:57,739 --> 02:00:00,052
metrics, people have their
self-esteem wrapped up

2672
02:00:00,052 --> 02:00:02,599
in how many followers or likes they get,

2673
02:00:02,599 --> 02:00:04,114
I'd rather have four people follow me

2674
02:00:04,114 --> 02:00:06,144
and three of them buying than 2.3 million

2675
02:00:06,144 --> 02:00:09,507
and none of them buying,
from a business standpoint.

2676
02:00:09,507 --> 02:00:13,007
From an ego standpoint,
the second one is rad.

2677
02:00:13,007 --> 02:00:16,489
But from a business standpoint,
those are specifics.

2678
02:00:16,489 --> 02:00:20,451
- One more, time frame of
it, is it an every day,

2679
02:00:20,451 --> 02:00:22,481
all day, 24-hour thing?

2680
02:00:22,481 --> 02:00:26,220
- Yeah, now that person is
not gonna work 24 hours,

2681
02:00:26,220 --> 02:00:27,053
but sure.

2682
02:00:28,132 --> 02:00:30,299
The answer is always more.

2683
02:00:31,503 --> 02:00:35,443
But then you go backwards,
so the answer is yes,

2684
02:00:35,443 --> 02:00:37,649
now what's practical
and what can you afford,

2685
02:00:37,649 --> 02:00:40,563
right, and wherever it
stops, that's where you want,

2686
02:00:40,563 --> 02:00:42,386
shoot for the moon and
end up in the clouds,

2687
02:00:42,386 --> 02:00:43,590
don't shoot for the mountain top

2688
02:00:43,590 --> 02:00:47,090
and end up somewhere in the fucking river.

2689
02:00:49,741 --> 02:00:53,908
Where the fuck does this
shit come from, thanks, bro.

2690
02:00:55,014 --> 02:00:56,193
Did you get that one D. Rock?

2691
02:00:56,193 --> 02:00:57,026
Thanks.

2692
02:00:57,026 --> 02:00:57,859
- What up, Gary V?

2693
02:00:57,859 --> 02:00:58,692
- [Gary] Hey man.

2694
02:00:58,692 --> 02:01:02,442
- I'm Vayland, and I'm
from the Corvalis, DB.

2695
02:01:03,408 --> 02:01:05,668
So, I'm going through a big
point of growth in my life,

2696
02:01:05,668 --> 02:01:08,227
I'm 20 years old and I
know the next 10 years

2697
02:01:08,227 --> 02:01:10,420
are gonna be a lot of progression for me,

2698
02:01:10,420 --> 02:01:12,967
if you could give yourself
one tip when you were

2699
02:01:12,967 --> 02:01:14,956
my age, what would it be?

2700
02:01:14,956 --> 02:01:16,873
- Don't count anything.

2701
02:01:18,155 --> 02:01:19,066
- [Audience Member] I feel that.

2702
02:01:19,066 --> 02:01:19,899
- Do you?

2703
02:01:21,301 --> 02:01:22,551
- I think I do.

2704
02:01:23,972 --> 02:01:26,224
- Let me tell you what I mean, literally

2705
02:01:26,224 --> 02:01:28,906
don't judge where you're
out for the next 10 years.

2706
02:01:28,906 --> 02:01:31,322
Literally close your eyes until you're 30.

2707
02:01:31,322 --> 02:01:33,585
Same advice I gave earlier.

2708
02:01:33,585 --> 02:01:37,081
The biggest problem for
people is they're keeping

2709
02:01:37,081 --> 02:01:39,883
score along the way, which
means they're looking back,

2710
02:01:39,883 --> 02:01:42,498
which is allowing people to pass them.

2711
02:01:42,498 --> 02:01:46,665
I went into a coma in my
20s, just like, checked out.

2712
02:01:47,873 --> 02:01:50,414
I don't think what I did was
right, I checked out so extreme

2713
02:01:50,414 --> 02:01:53,403
that I stopped talking to
anybody, I just went there,

2714
02:01:53,403 --> 02:01:57,225
right, I think, in hindsight
there is a healthier balance,

2715
02:01:57,225 --> 02:01:59,641
but I think everybody else is
too much in the other place,

2716
02:01:59,641 --> 02:02:02,169
like at 30 I'm gonna be
this, at 22 this, and if I'm

2717
02:02:02,169 --> 02:02:03,983
not the manager at 21,
then I'm gonna be this,

2718
02:02:03,983 --> 02:02:06,155
if I'm not making 63,000 at 20,

2719
02:02:06,155 --> 02:02:08,026
people are just counting
against themselves because

2720
02:02:08,026 --> 02:02:10,298
they're so used to the
game of school and rankings

2721
02:02:10,298 --> 02:02:12,818
and scoring and then you
get into the real world

2722
02:02:12,818 --> 02:02:16,823
where it's detrimental, not a positive.

2723
02:02:16,823 --> 02:02:17,793
Do you understand?

2724
02:02:17,793 --> 02:02:18,626
- [Audience Member] I do.

2725
02:02:18,626 --> 02:02:20,501
- And you're gonna wake up
at 30, I woke up at my 30th

2726
02:02:20,501 --> 02:02:22,468
birthday, this is a real
story, drove to the store,

2727
02:02:22,468 --> 02:02:25,419
looked myself in the mirror
and I said the next 10 years

2728
02:02:25,419 --> 02:02:28,641
are gonna be really
important building years.

2729
02:02:28,641 --> 02:02:31,047
You just do that at 20,
I promise you when you're

2730
02:02:31,047 --> 02:02:33,349
at 30, you're gonna do the same thing.

2731
02:02:33,349 --> 02:02:35,217
So, the answer is, it's forever, there's

2732
02:02:35,217 --> 02:02:37,856
important years in your
20s, there's important years

2733
02:02:37,856 --> 02:02:40,234
in your 30s, there's
important years in your 40s,

2734
02:02:40,234 --> 02:02:43,370
and 50s and 60s and 70s and 80s and 90s.

2735
02:02:43,370 --> 02:02:47,537
So, don't over-judge yourself,
do learn the work ethic

2736
02:02:48,994 --> 02:02:52,647
and the skills that match your ambition.

2737
02:02:52,647 --> 02:02:56,814
- [Audience Member] Thank you
Gary, don't stop grinding.

2738
02:03:01,502 --> 02:03:02,829
- Hi.

2739
02:03:02,829 --> 02:03:04,134
- Hi, I'm Hannah.

2740
02:03:04,134 --> 02:03:04,967
- [Gary] What's your name?

2741
02:03:04,967 --> 02:03:05,800
- Hannah.

2742
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:06,633
- [Gary] Hannah?

2743
02:03:06,633 --> 02:03:08,098
- Yeah, I don't want
to say where I'm from,

2744
02:03:08,098 --> 02:03:09,007
I don't want them to scream.

2745
02:03:09,007 --> 02:03:11,912
- [Gary] Okay, does screaming
freaks you the fuck out?

2746
02:03:11,912 --> 02:03:14,927
- Yeah, because I would
probably start shaking.

2747
02:03:14,927 --> 02:03:16,303
I have kind of a broad question, though,

2748
02:03:16,303 --> 02:03:18,662
I eventually want to get
to something creative,

2749
02:03:18,662 --> 02:03:21,446
like marketing or something like that,

2750
02:03:21,446 --> 02:03:24,029
and I stopped going to college.

2751
02:03:25,231 --> 02:03:26,064
- [Gary] Awesome.

2752
02:03:26,064 --> 02:03:27,416
- I think that was a bad decision.

2753
02:03:27,416 --> 02:03:28,509
- [Gary] No.

2754
02:03:28,509 --> 02:03:29,922
- You think I could
still make that happen?

2755
02:03:29,922 --> 02:03:31,572
- A 100,000%.

2756
02:03:31,572 --> 02:03:32,405
- Okay.

2757
02:03:34,686 --> 02:03:38,853
- Good, Hannah, Hannah, do
you know that if you spend

2758
02:03:42,692 --> 02:03:45,843
the next three months
emailing people that have

2759
02:03:45,843 --> 02:03:49,434
businesses that have jobs
that you're interested in,

2760
02:03:49,434 --> 02:03:51,625
one of them would say yes?

2761
02:03:51,625 --> 02:03:52,458
- [Audience Member] No.

2762
02:03:52,458 --> 02:03:53,541
- Good, that would happen.

2763
02:03:53,541 --> 02:03:54,374
- [Audience Member] Free advice.

2764
02:03:54,374 --> 02:03:55,207
- Free advice.

2765
02:03:55,207 --> 02:03:56,040
- [Audience Member] Thank you so much.

2766
02:03:56,040 --> 02:03:57,123
- You got it.

2767
02:04:00,514 --> 02:04:02,037
- [Audience Member] What's up, Gary?

2768
02:04:02,037 --> 02:04:02,971
- [Gary] Life is good, man, how are you?

2769
02:04:02,971 --> 02:04:03,804
- Pretty good.

2770
02:04:03,804 --> 02:04:07,971
My name is Alec Peter, I'm here
from Rosenberg with my crew

2771
02:04:09,363 --> 02:04:11,810
and you can make as much noise.

2772
02:04:11,810 --> 02:04:13,444
- [Gary] No, but the one
dude was doing some kind

2773
02:04:13,444 --> 02:04:15,177
of crazy thing.

2774
02:04:15,177 --> 02:04:16,802
I love it, respect.

2775
02:04:16,802 --> 02:04:19,565
- First off, thank you for
giving us your time and I'm

2776
02:04:19,565 --> 02:04:22,919
pretty stoked that I finally
was able to get up here,

2777
02:04:22,919 --> 02:04:24,947
and ask you this question,

2778
02:04:24,947 --> 02:04:28,853
I've been trying to focus
more on stop thinking

2779
02:04:28,853 --> 02:04:33,021
and doing more, and this
is my one starting point,

2780
02:04:33,021 --> 02:04:36,854
I'm here off to start
doing and stop thinking.

2781
02:04:38,043 --> 02:04:39,699
Thank you.

2782
02:04:39,699 --> 02:04:41,969
- [Gary] No worries, man, keep it going.

2783
02:04:41,969 --> 02:04:44,800
- My question is, so you
do what you do every single

2784
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:47,608
day, you wake up and
you run your business,

2785
02:04:47,608 --> 02:04:51,426
and you do your daily
vlogs and you go places,

2786
02:04:51,426 --> 02:04:53,855
and you're a motivational
speaker for a lot of people

2787
02:04:53,855 --> 02:04:57,108
and people look up to you
and they need motivation

2788
02:04:57,108 --> 02:04:59,236
so they look up your shit.

2789
02:04:59,236 --> 02:05:03,123
What drives you to do what
you do and just keep moving

2790
02:05:03,123 --> 02:05:05,748
and don't stop what you're doing?

2791
02:05:05,748 --> 02:05:08,665
- The gratitude for that situation.

2792
02:05:09,892 --> 02:05:12,754
I'm completely driven by gratitude.

2793
02:05:12,754 --> 02:05:14,459
Do you know how grateful I am?

2794
02:05:14,459 --> 02:05:16,626
Do you know what did I do?

2795
02:05:18,307 --> 02:05:22,653
My parents had sex at this
one moment and created me.

2796
02:05:22,653 --> 02:05:25,415
Like, I'm being serious,
I'm being grateful,

2797
02:05:25,415 --> 02:05:27,855
I have such a good thing
going, people like it,

2798
02:05:27,855 --> 02:05:31,396
I like it, it's so
good, but what did I do?

2799
02:05:31,396 --> 02:05:33,691
Do you know how lucky I was
that I was an immigrant?

2800
02:05:33,691 --> 02:05:35,932
Do you know how much I'm driven
by a chip on my shoulder,

2801
02:05:35,932 --> 02:05:37,885
do you know how lucky I
got that I was 4ft 11 when

2802
02:05:37,885 --> 02:05:39,562
I went into freshman year of high school,

2803
02:05:39,562 --> 02:05:41,956
all these things went in my favor,

2804
02:05:41,956 --> 02:05:45,282
I don't know man, I'm driven by gratitude.

2805
02:05:45,282 --> 02:05:47,962
Every morning I wake up
and I'm just grateful,

2806
02:05:47,962 --> 02:05:51,788
grateful, grateful, I'm
42 years old almost,

2807
02:05:51,788 --> 02:05:56,237
and unfortunately, three of
my four grandparents died

2808
02:05:56,237 --> 02:05:58,031
before I got to know them,

2809
02:05:58,031 --> 02:06:01,386
so not only was I born
in a communist country,

2810
02:06:01,386 --> 02:06:04,172
where capitalism and
entrepreneurship is shit on,

2811
02:06:04,172 --> 02:06:06,472
I went to the place where
it's post on a pedestal,

2812
02:06:06,472 --> 02:06:08,434
I got the greatest mom in the world,

2813
02:06:08,434 --> 02:06:12,005
my dad taught me work ethic and my word,

2814
02:06:12,005 --> 02:06:14,432
which made me not a bullshit
artist, saved my ass.

2815
02:06:14,432 --> 02:06:16,432
Right, but then on top of everything else,

2816
02:06:16,432 --> 02:06:18,782
I've had very little death
or pain around me and I'm

2817
02:06:18,782 --> 02:06:21,976
42 years old, it's unfortunate
why that's the case,

2818
02:06:21,976 --> 02:06:24,565
given the circumstances before,
but it's still my reality

2819
02:06:24,565 --> 02:06:28,493
and I have a communications
style that for some reason,

2820
02:06:28,493 --> 02:06:31,801
who knew, don't forget, I was 33 years old

2821
02:06:31,801 --> 02:06:33,758
before I even made a video.

2822
02:06:33,758 --> 02:06:36,902
I've never thought this could be real,

2823
02:06:36,902 --> 02:06:38,603
it didn't even fucking cross my mind,

2824
02:06:38,603 --> 02:06:39,990
I was a business man.

2825
02:06:39,990 --> 02:06:42,034
Like, watching 20-year-olds
that are hungry

2826
02:06:42,034 --> 02:06:43,445
and thinking about their lives,

2827
02:06:43,445 --> 02:06:45,519
I'm excited because I'm
like, bro, you don't have

2828
02:06:45,519 --> 02:06:47,432
any clue where this might fucking go,

2829
02:06:47,432 --> 02:06:51,150
because at 31 years old,
I'm like, maybe I'll make

2830
02:06:51,150 --> 02:06:53,544
one video on this YouTube
thing, you have no idea

2831
02:06:53,544 --> 02:06:56,921
where it's going, so I'm
completely driven by gratitude,

2832
02:06:56,921 --> 02:07:00,636
I'm so thankful, I'm so
grateful and it drives

2833
02:07:00,636 --> 02:07:02,267
the shit out of me.

2834
02:07:02,267 --> 02:07:04,763
- And that helps you to
not procrastinate and just

2835
02:07:04,763 --> 02:07:08,427
be in a slump, if you
ever are, in a slump,

2836
02:07:08,427 --> 02:07:09,924
I'm sure we all are.

2837
02:07:09,924 --> 02:07:11,646
- Everybody is in a slump,
but here's my thing, man,

2838
02:07:11,646 --> 02:07:13,313
nobody gives a shit.

2839
02:07:14,562 --> 02:07:15,405
- [Audience Member] Fuck yeah.

2840
02:07:15,405 --> 02:07:18,871
- You know what I mean, the
thing that people don't realize

2841
02:07:18,871 --> 02:07:21,159
about slumps and depression
and things like that,

2842
02:07:21,159 --> 02:07:22,959
you got to break them
down, for some people

2843
02:07:22,959 --> 02:07:25,318
it's a real disease, it's
real stuff, but that's on

2844
02:07:25,318 --> 02:07:28,648
a different plane, but being in a slump,

2845
02:07:28,648 --> 02:07:32,340
everybody's in a slump,
everybody's got adversity,

2846
02:07:32,340 --> 02:07:33,358
there's always something.

2847
02:07:33,358 --> 02:07:35,252
To me, somebody has always got it worse.

2848
02:07:35,252 --> 02:07:38,158
There's 7.7 billion people and unless I'm

2849
02:07:38,158 --> 02:07:40,870
in some weird little
cage in some fourth world

2850
02:07:40,870 --> 02:07:44,191
country, that means I'm not in last place,

2851
02:07:44,191 --> 02:07:47,013
which means I've got
nothing to complain about,

2852
02:07:47,013 --> 02:07:47,846
you know what I mean?

2853
02:07:47,846 --> 02:07:48,679
- [Audience Member] Yeah.

2854
02:07:48,679 --> 02:07:49,923
- You live in America.

2855
02:07:49,923 --> 02:07:50,756
- [Audience Member] Fuck yeah.

2856
02:07:50,756 --> 02:07:53,282
- The fuck are you complaining about?

2857
02:07:53,282 --> 02:07:56,671
- I was just wondering,
you've spoken for a lot of

2858
02:07:56,671 --> 02:08:00,882
businesses and people, I was
just wondering what do you

2859
02:08:00,882 --> 02:08:03,752
think about Dutch Bros and
what we are and what we do

2860
02:08:03,752 --> 02:08:06,827
and the questions that a lot
of the people have asked you?

2861
02:08:06,827 --> 02:08:08,677
- Look, the biggest takeaway
for me is there is a lot

2862
02:08:08,677 --> 02:08:11,059
of energy, it's young and
all that, it's all rad,

2863
02:08:11,059 --> 02:08:14,484
to me, it's just really
cool that there's a smart

2864
02:08:14,484 --> 02:08:15,707
operator at the top.

2865
02:08:15,707 --> 02:08:18,048
And listen, you guys know
me, I don't know him,

2866
02:08:18,048 --> 02:08:20,874
I don't give a fuck about him.

2867
02:08:20,874 --> 02:08:22,860
I'm being serious.

2868
02:08:22,860 --> 02:08:27,027
And the same way he does it
to me, but it's important

2869
02:08:28,015 --> 02:08:29,547
for me to tell you this,
we don't know each other,

2870
02:08:29,547 --> 02:08:31,457
we met three seconds
before I came on stage,

2871
02:08:31,457 --> 02:08:34,000
it's just cool to see
somebody smart and building

2872
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,502
a framework that works
both for his organization

2873
02:08:36,502 --> 02:08:39,194
and the people in it, I know
it because I do it as well

2874
02:08:39,194 --> 02:08:41,714
and it's cool, I'm
hopeful that this becomes

2875
02:08:41,714 --> 02:08:45,205
humongous because you need
examples of capitalism

2876
02:08:45,205 --> 02:08:48,040
that is positive on both
sides, because I think

2877
02:08:48,040 --> 02:08:49,900
that's a 2.0 version, right?

2878
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:54,124
The reason I'm excited,
that I'm cool to young kids,

2879
02:08:54,124 --> 02:08:57,780
is I'm teaching them good
principles, not bad principles.

2880
02:08:57,780 --> 02:09:00,897
All the other dickfaces that
are popular on Instagram

2881
02:09:00,897 --> 02:09:03,387
and YouTube are flashing fucking cars

2882
02:09:03,387 --> 02:09:06,324
and watches and fucking
clubs, and all this fucking

2883
02:09:06,324 --> 02:09:09,245
shit down these 23-year-old dudes' mouths

2884
02:09:09,245 --> 02:09:11,301
and it's fucking stupid
because it's short-term

2885
02:09:11,301 --> 02:09:15,604
behavior, I am collecting
popularity because of gratitude

2886
02:09:15,604 --> 02:09:18,461
and because once I get
them in, them in like,

2887
02:09:18,461 --> 02:09:20,803
okay, listen, you want to
know what the real thing is?

2888
02:09:20,803 --> 02:09:22,758
It's fucking hard work,
it's being respectful,

2889
02:09:22,758 --> 02:09:24,703
it's being a good person,
it's being 30 years

2890
02:09:24,703 --> 02:09:28,063
in the making and to
me, my energy of this,

2891
02:09:28,063 --> 02:09:31,468
it's cool to see it because
you don't see it often

2892
02:09:31,468 --> 02:09:34,274
and when you see it, you appreciate it.

2893
02:09:34,274 --> 02:09:37,441
(audience applauding)

2894
02:09:41,522 --> 02:09:42,850
Two more.

2895
02:09:42,850 --> 02:09:44,651
I got to go, I apologize.

2896
02:09:44,651 --> 02:09:46,481
- I'll keep it short, I
promise, thanks for staying.

2897
02:09:46,481 --> 02:09:49,564
Gary, I'm Chelsea, I'm with the DBAZ.

2898
02:09:50,876 --> 02:09:52,765
We're all getting tired.

2899
02:09:52,765 --> 02:09:55,215
So, I love that you say listen to people,

2900
02:09:55,215 --> 02:09:57,979
I get to be at a position
that's a little bit like

2901
02:09:57,979 --> 02:10:00,939
your chief hiring officer in your offices,

2902
02:10:00,939 --> 02:10:03,289
I've been in that gray
area for a while though,

2903
02:10:03,289 --> 02:10:05,294
engagement, and player
retention, that kind of thing.

2904
02:10:05,294 --> 02:10:06,787
- [Gary] Okay.

2905
02:10:06,787 --> 02:10:10,818
- I wonder when it's
important to say I don't give

2906
02:10:10,818 --> 02:10:13,269
a fuck about your opinion
and when it's important

2907
02:10:13,269 --> 02:10:16,556
to say, hey I need to
coach you and guide you

2908
02:10:16,556 --> 02:10:18,743
and actually pull you aside
from this path that you're

2909
02:10:18,743 --> 02:10:19,690
on right now?

2910
02:10:19,690 --> 02:10:20,543
- I think you know.

2911
02:10:20,543 --> 02:10:22,518
How long have you been doing that?

2912
02:10:22,518 --> 02:10:23,493
- [Audience Member] Six years.

2913
02:10:23,493 --> 02:10:24,674
- Do you like it?

2914
02:10:24,674 --> 02:10:25,507
- [Audience Member] Love it.

2915
02:10:25,507 --> 02:10:26,442
- Comes natural, right?

2916
02:10:26,442 --> 02:10:27,313
- [Audience Member] Yeah.

2917
02:10:27,313 --> 02:10:29,259
- You know the answer,
it's circumstantial.

2918
02:10:29,259 --> 02:10:32,717
Right, the fact that you
even asked me that way

2919
02:10:32,717 --> 02:10:37,016
made me know that I
didn't have to answer it.

2920
02:10:37,016 --> 02:10:38,549
You know what you're doing.

2921
02:10:38,549 --> 02:10:43,079
The thing for you and I
and people that really

2922
02:10:43,079 --> 02:10:46,738
give a fuck about HR and
people is it's tough,

2923
02:10:46,738 --> 02:10:49,975
it's so emotionally draining, right,

2924
02:10:49,975 --> 02:10:52,279
because when you see somebody
who's not self-aware,

2925
02:10:52,279 --> 02:10:56,583
you know how tough, the
game is already over, right?

2926
02:10:56,583 --> 02:10:59,849
I think the one thing I would tell you,

2927
02:10:59,849 --> 02:11:02,195
you can see how I talk about these issues,

2928
02:11:02,195 --> 02:11:06,186
I go that one extra place
where most people don't go,

2929
02:11:06,186 --> 02:11:08,133
it's because that uncomfortable place,

2930
02:11:08,133 --> 02:11:10,679
fuck you, mom, and this and
that, that uncomfortable

2931
02:11:10,679 --> 02:11:12,975
place is where it is.

2932
02:11:12,975 --> 02:11:14,660
Because what you're doing
as somebody who loves it

2933
02:11:14,660 --> 02:11:17,284
and is good at it, and what I
was doing early in my career

2934
02:11:17,284 --> 02:11:19,586
is you go right to the
edge, the problem is,

2935
02:11:19,586 --> 02:11:21,819
that doesn't create the unlock.

2936
02:11:21,819 --> 02:11:24,523
The unlock is when you suffocate it.

2937
02:11:24,523 --> 02:11:27,122
So, I think about it
like this, I try to give

2938
02:11:27,122 --> 02:11:28,984
a bunch of honey before
I deliver the vinegar,

2939
02:11:28,984 --> 02:11:32,244
and I go back to the extremes of pulling,

2940
02:11:32,244 --> 02:11:33,863
if I'm gonna have a tough
conversation, I'm gonna

2941
02:11:33,863 --> 02:11:35,702
really set the framework,
which is like, look,

2942
02:11:35,702 --> 02:11:37,917
I'll do anything for you,
you don't have to work here,

2943
02:11:37,917 --> 02:11:41,356
I'll make it so awesome, and then I'll go,

2944
02:11:41,356 --> 02:11:44,440
you're a fuck-face, and
you're a fuck-face because

2945
02:11:44,440 --> 02:11:46,672
you're insecure and Karen
underneath is better

2946
02:11:46,672 --> 02:11:49,164
than you, so you're suppressing
her because you don't

2947
02:11:49,164 --> 02:11:51,194
want her to take your
job, because this is about

2948
02:11:51,194 --> 02:11:53,566
as high as you're gonna
get up and you know that.

2949
02:11:53,566 --> 02:11:55,305
So, what's happening is
you're manifesting bad

2950
02:11:55,305 --> 02:11:57,194
behavior because you're
protecting your grounds,

2951
02:11:57,194 --> 02:11:59,499
'cause you got to pay
your mortgage, I get it.

2952
02:11:59,499 --> 02:12:02,911
But it's not gonna work, so now what?

2953
02:12:02,911 --> 02:12:05,199
So, that's the part that's hard,

2954
02:12:05,199 --> 02:12:08,367
but when you really give a
fuck, if you're making decisions

2955
02:12:08,367 --> 02:12:10,200
because you have to hit
a certain margin to pay

2956
02:12:10,200 --> 02:12:12,340
to the mothership, that's
different, but I know

2957
02:12:12,340 --> 02:12:14,353
that's not the case already,
so you're fucking lucky,

2958
02:12:14,353 --> 02:12:17,704
you know how many people have
to make decisions on that?

2959
02:12:17,704 --> 02:12:20,216
So, you're making decisions
on EQ, so you're just

2960
02:12:20,216 --> 02:12:23,395
gonna have to go that,
if we're gonna have this

2961
02:12:23,395 --> 02:12:26,215
moment together, six months,
six months going one step

2962
02:12:26,215 --> 02:12:29,595
further in radical candor
which does not come natural

2963
02:12:29,595 --> 02:12:30,428
to us.

2964
02:12:31,699 --> 02:12:33,041
- [Audience Member] Or maybe Dutch Bros.

2965
02:12:33,041 --> 02:12:34,407
- Or maybe Dutch Bros.

2966
02:12:34,407 --> 02:12:36,977
Radical candor is tough and
I get it, and by the way,

2967
02:12:36,977 --> 02:12:39,490
not maybe Dutch Bros,
everything I can tell already

2968
02:12:39,490 --> 02:12:40,871
makes me know they're not good at it

2969
02:12:40,871 --> 02:12:42,586
because I'm not good at it.

2970
02:12:42,586 --> 02:12:45,355
When you're so EQ-ed out
and it's so good vibes,

2971
02:12:45,355 --> 02:12:49,522
you're leaving money on the
table because it feels better.

2972
02:12:50,467 --> 02:12:53,001
So radical candor comes hard,
but it's the evolution for

2973
02:12:53,001 --> 02:12:55,908
him and me and our next
frontier, for us to take our

2974
02:12:55,908 --> 02:12:58,768
companies to the next level,
we have to inject a little

2975
02:12:58,768 --> 02:13:01,868
bit of that and the way
I'm doing it is a different

2976
02:13:01,868 --> 02:13:03,634
version of what we've
been doing, this is now me

2977
02:13:03,634 --> 02:13:06,108
talking to him, I'm
creating bigger severances,

2978
02:13:06,108 --> 02:13:10,275
real packages, mascot jobs
that don't bother anybody else,

2979
02:13:11,191 --> 02:13:13,840
anything if I have to deal
with 17 people that I'm

2980
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:17,502
emotional towards, that are
fucking everything else up,

2981
02:13:17,502 --> 02:13:20,363
but not addressing it will
collapse the whole fucking

2982
02:13:20,363 --> 02:13:22,606
empire and that's why I call
my organization the honey

2983
02:13:22,606 --> 02:13:25,350
empire, the honey empire.

2984
02:13:25,350 --> 02:13:27,573
It's not the empire of
honey, I will always chose

2985
02:13:27,573 --> 02:13:31,166
people .1% more than the business,

2986
02:13:31,166 --> 02:13:35,083
but after you get into
year three, seven, nine,

2987
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:39,602
you get to a scale where
your strength becomes

2988
02:13:39,602 --> 02:13:41,935
your vulnerability, so yeah.

2989
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:44,686
- The leaders above me are great

2990
02:13:44,686 --> 02:13:47,313
with radical candor, it's the millennials

2991
02:13:47,313 --> 02:13:48,521
and the generation z

2992
02:13:48,521 --> 02:13:51,106
that's coming up that seem
a little bit more sensitive

2993
02:13:51,106 --> 02:13:52,338
towards that kind of thing.

2994
02:13:52,338 --> 02:13:54,039
- Yeah, but I'll be honest
with you, that's a cop-out,

2995
02:13:54,039 --> 02:13:57,789
I'm not gonna let the
millennial generation z

2996
02:13:58,710 --> 02:14:01,775
be the conversation, I
actually think that we should

2997
02:14:01,775 --> 02:14:04,827
be looking at ourselves, and not them,

2998
02:14:04,827 --> 02:14:07,570
because it's easier to
be like you fucking kids,

2999
02:14:07,570 --> 02:14:09,128
I don't believe in that bullshit,

3000
02:14:09,128 --> 02:14:11,648
I really don't, it's us.

3001
02:14:11,648 --> 02:14:12,481
You know?

3002
02:14:13,715 --> 02:14:14,548
It's us.

3003
02:14:15,970 --> 02:14:18,434
They are big boys and
girls and there's plenty

3004
02:14:18,434 --> 02:14:21,756
of fucking people that are
soft as shit in their 40s,

3005
02:14:21,756 --> 02:14:25,796
60s and 80s too, that were lazy
as fuck and entitled as fuck

3006
02:14:25,796 --> 02:14:29,102
and the same way with that
dude with the technology,

3007
02:14:29,102 --> 02:14:32,748
we are using the millennial
and the gen z cop-out

3008
02:14:32,748 --> 02:14:36,190
of entitlement to not address
it because subconsciously

3009
02:14:36,190 --> 02:14:38,633
we've got our own things to work through.

3010
02:14:38,633 --> 02:14:40,466
It's always our fault.

3011
02:14:41,438 --> 02:14:44,605
(audience applauding)

3012
02:14:45,901 --> 02:14:46,734
- [Audience Member] What's up, Gary?

3013
02:14:46,734 --> 02:14:48,301
- What's up, bro?

3014
02:14:48,301 --> 02:14:49,990
- My man, I've got to be honest with you,

3015
02:14:49,990 --> 02:14:54,243
I've never heard of you
before until this day.

3016
02:14:54,243 --> 02:14:55,817
- [Gary] I get it, I've
never heard of you either.

3017
02:14:55,817 --> 02:14:57,484
- Dude, thanks, man.

3018
02:14:58,640 --> 02:15:00,040
Well, we're hearing each other now.

3019
02:15:00,040 --> 02:15:01,631
- [Gary] Here we are.

3020
02:15:01,631 --> 02:15:03,111
- And I'm definitely
gonna look up your stuff,

3021
02:15:03,111 --> 02:15:04,496
that's for sure, I'm gonna say that.

3022
02:15:04,496 --> 02:15:05,463
- [Gary] I'm gonna definitely look up you,

3023
02:15:05,463 --> 02:15:09,130
you're like straight
out of central casting.

3024
02:15:11,702 --> 02:15:12,535
- Thanks.

3025
02:15:14,579 --> 02:15:15,458
- [Gary] What's your name?

3026
02:15:15,458 --> 02:15:17,281
- My name, oh, my name's
Kyle, but everyone

3027
02:15:17,281 --> 02:15:19,381
just calls me by my last name, Rodo.

3028
02:15:19,381 --> 02:15:23,002
- [Gary] Rodo, loving
it, let's do it Rodo.

3029
02:15:23,002 --> 02:15:25,039
- So, I have two questions for you.

3030
02:15:25,039 --> 02:15:26,627
The first one is about SnapChat.

3031
02:15:26,627 --> 02:15:27,460
- [Gary] Okay.

3032
02:15:27,460 --> 02:15:30,534
- So, I run the SnapChat
for my franchise, it's

3033
02:15:30,534 --> 02:15:32,208
in West Valley Arizona.

3034
02:15:32,208 --> 02:15:36,211
They all just left
except for her, they had

3035
02:15:36,211 --> 02:15:37,383
to catch a flight.

3036
02:15:37,383 --> 02:15:38,266
- [Gary] She's a gangster.

3037
02:15:38,266 --> 02:15:39,294
- Oh, dude, I know.

3038
02:15:39,294 --> 02:15:40,606
- [Gary] That's your girl?

3039
02:15:40,606 --> 02:15:41,679
- Yeah, I'm dating her.

3040
02:15:41,679 --> 02:15:44,643
- Oh, you're dating her,
like she's really your girl?

3041
02:15:44,643 --> 02:15:45,476
Okay.

3042
02:15:46,614 --> 02:15:49,038
That's not exactly where
I was going, but it makes

3043
02:15:49,038 --> 02:15:50,788
it awesome, go ahead.

3044
02:15:51,810 --> 02:15:54,060
- So, what can I be doing--

3045
02:15:55,487 --> 02:15:56,386
- [Gary] To make it better?

3046
02:15:56,386 --> 02:15:59,564
- Not even to make it
better, damn, yeah, I guess--

3047
02:15:59,564 --> 02:16:02,224
- [Gary] Do you want people
to come into the store?

3048
02:16:02,224 --> 02:16:03,057
- What's that?

3049
02:16:03,057 --> 02:16:04,315
- [Gary] You want people to
come to the business, right?

3050
02:16:04,315 --> 02:16:05,597
- Hell yeah.

3051
02:16:05,597 --> 02:16:08,093
- Let me throw a really
interesting curveball at you.

3052
02:16:08,093 --> 02:16:10,496
You should literally take
the account right now,

3053
02:16:10,496 --> 02:16:14,247
look at it, and be like,
hey, guys, what can I do here

3054
02:16:14,247 --> 02:16:16,918
to make it better for you?

3055
02:16:16,918 --> 02:16:21,026
One of the craziest moves in
social that I find fascinating

3056
02:16:21,026 --> 02:16:24,560
is just asking the
audience what they want,

3057
02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:27,400
you'll be blown away by how
much feedback you'll get

3058
02:16:27,400 --> 02:16:29,428
that will unlock.

3059
02:16:29,428 --> 02:16:33,547
Literally, like, hey, it's
Rodo, I run the fucking

3060
02:16:33,547 --> 02:16:38,102
shit for this store, what up,
I need you guys to tell me.

3061
02:16:38,102 --> 02:16:40,348
And SnapChat is legit now,
you can just keep holding it

3062
02:16:40,348 --> 02:16:42,490
down, so you're good, you don't
have the 10 second bullshit

3063
02:16:42,490 --> 02:16:43,629
anymore, right?

3064
02:16:43,629 --> 02:16:46,400
So, you're just holding
it down, it's Rodo,

3065
02:16:46,401 --> 02:16:48,952
what up, I fucking run
shit here, what do you guys

3066
02:16:48,952 --> 02:16:50,787
want on this SnapChat?

3067
02:16:50,788 --> 02:16:53,056
And here's what's gonna happen,
80% of them are gonna be

3068
02:16:53,056 --> 02:16:55,878
like, give us free shit, no shit.

3069
02:16:55,878 --> 02:16:59,879
Which you can mix in, by
the way, I'm on a whole kick

3070
02:16:59,879 --> 02:17:01,727
at Wine Library now, every
Saturday, we're just giving

3071
02:17:01,727 --> 02:17:04,671
away $10 worth of gourmet
food and we're doing it,

3072
02:17:04,672 --> 02:17:06,563
the ROI actually works.

3073
02:17:06,563 --> 02:17:09,376
Giving away free shit,
people like to shit on it,

3074
02:17:09,376 --> 02:17:11,429
it's kind of clever if
you've got something good,

3075
02:17:11,429 --> 02:17:13,716
because the cost of entry is low.

3076
02:17:13,716 --> 02:17:17,565
But look, you know this,
people want entertainment,

3077
02:17:17,565 --> 02:17:21,849
and you're fucking entertaining
just on your fucking face.

3078
02:17:21,849 --> 02:17:23,367
You know?

3079
02:17:23,367 --> 02:17:24,200
I mean it.

3080
02:17:24,200 --> 02:17:25,906
- Yeah, I hustle hard for that.

3081
02:17:25,906 --> 02:17:28,994
- I believe you, so
remember when I talk about

3082
02:17:28,994 --> 02:17:30,692
bet on your strengths,
not on your weaknesses,

3083
02:17:30,692 --> 02:17:35,409
go fucking all Bill and
Ted's excellent adventure.

3084
02:17:35,410 --> 02:17:39,577
Go all, I mean it, I can
taste it from this far away,

3085
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:43,500
you'd be entertaining as fuck,
and it will bring people.

3086
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:46,316
Make every fucking person
want to watch it for you

3087
02:17:46,316 --> 02:17:49,782
and for Larry, the mop
guy, 'cause he's funny,

3088
02:17:49,782 --> 02:17:52,199
create a fucking sitcom, bro.

3089
02:17:53,559 --> 02:17:54,989
- Thank you.

3090
02:17:54,990 --> 02:17:56,990
So, before I go to my second
question, would you mind

3091
02:17:56,990 --> 02:17:58,621
if I took that SnapChat right now?

3092
02:17:58,621 --> 02:17:59,703
- [Gary] Yeah, let's do it.

3093
02:17:59,704 --> 02:18:01,371
- I appreciate that.

3094
02:18:07,405 --> 02:18:08,692
All right, here we go, brother.

3095
02:18:08,692 --> 02:18:10,609
- [Gary] Go ahead, bro.

3096
02:18:11,480 --> 02:18:13,540
- What's up, DB, West Valley,

3097
02:18:13,540 --> 02:18:17,707
I'm here with, (audience cheering).

3098
02:18:19,293 --> 02:18:23,123
I'm here with Gary V, he's a
huge motivational speaker--

3099
02:18:23,123 --> 02:18:25,124
- [Gary] He never heard
of me before today!

3100
02:18:25,124 --> 02:18:28,079
- I haven't, I haven't, but we're here,

3101
02:18:28,079 --> 02:18:32,235
and we are curious to see
what you guys want to see

3102
02:18:32,235 --> 02:18:34,449
or we're curious to hear
what you guys want to see

3103
02:18:34,449 --> 02:18:36,609
on this SnapChat.

3104
02:18:36,609 --> 02:18:40,192
- Tell him, tell him
what you fucking want!

3105
02:18:41,450 --> 02:18:44,113
Can we do that, that's okay, right?

3106
02:18:44,114 --> 02:18:48,114
It's okay, it's approved,
approved from the top.

3107
02:18:49,459 --> 02:18:50,292
Yeah!

3108
02:18:56,561 --> 02:18:57,546
- I'm posting that.

3109
02:18:57,546 --> 02:18:59,963
- [Gary] I bet you are, Rodo.

3110
02:19:01,916 --> 02:19:03,333
Okay, number two.

3111
02:19:05,967 --> 02:19:08,213
- Everything you've been
saying about self-insight,

3112
02:19:08,213 --> 02:19:11,405
and self-awareness moment,
I'm eating that shit up,

3113
02:19:11,405 --> 02:19:12,237
I love it.

3114
02:19:12,237 --> 02:19:14,206
- [Gary] Good, it's delicious, right?

3115
02:19:14,207 --> 02:19:15,661
- Oh, good, dude, yes.

3116
02:19:15,661 --> 02:19:19,099
- [Gary] What does it
taste like, cinnamon?

3117
02:19:19,099 --> 02:19:21,002
Okay, go ahead.

3118
02:19:21,002 --> 02:19:22,835
- So, I have so many--

3119
02:19:24,241 --> 02:19:26,416
- [Gary] Go ahead, we're
not going anywhere.

3120
02:19:26,416 --> 02:19:29,516
- What you've been saying with
like, how you are constantly

3121
02:19:29,517 --> 02:19:31,822
finding out new shit
about yourself every day,

3122
02:19:31,822 --> 02:19:34,330
but also you have these--

3123
02:19:34,330 --> 02:19:35,563
- [Gary] Core principles?

3124
02:19:35,563 --> 02:19:39,730
- Yeah, you were telling that
guy, fuck your girlfriend,

3125
02:19:41,225 --> 02:19:45,980
like, love them, but don't
fucking listen to them,

3126
02:19:45,980 --> 02:19:49,469
how do you, while you're
still constantly learning

3127
02:19:49,469 --> 02:19:51,473
new stuff about yourself
every day, how do you keep

3128
02:19:51,473 --> 02:19:53,900
this self-insight in check?

3129
02:19:53,900 --> 02:19:55,339
How do I know--

3130
02:19:55,339 --> 02:19:56,944
- [Gary] You're right?

3131
02:19:56,944 --> 02:19:58,987
Everybody wants to know if they're right.

3132
02:19:58,987 --> 02:20:00,394
- [Audience Member] Yeah, well, I mean--

3133
02:20:00,394 --> 02:20:01,394
- You don't.

3134
02:20:03,851 --> 02:20:04,798
- [Audience Member] Except sometimes.

3135
02:20:04,798 --> 02:20:08,965
- No, dude, to me, this is
why intent has been brought up

3136
02:20:10,585 --> 02:20:14,978
so much, my big thing is
I don't know if I'm right,

3137
02:20:14,978 --> 02:20:16,637
I just know I'm doing things for the right

3138
02:20:16,637 --> 02:20:19,689
reasons, and I'm okay with
letting the chips fall

3139
02:20:19,689 --> 02:20:21,041
where they may.

3140
02:20:21,041 --> 02:20:22,751
Let me tell you something
that didn't get brought

3141
02:20:22,751 --> 02:20:25,738
up today while we're on this gig.

3142
02:20:25,738 --> 02:20:28,512
One of the biggest reasons a
lot of you don't do the right

3143
02:20:28,512 --> 02:20:32,372
thing is because you expect
somebody to do that in return

3144
02:20:32,372 --> 02:20:33,705
after you do it.

3145
02:20:35,039 --> 02:20:38,175
And that expectation, the reason I'm good

3146
02:20:38,175 --> 02:20:42,961
is because I give with
zero expectation in return.

3147
02:20:42,961 --> 02:20:45,933
And when you give with
zero expectation in return,

3148
02:20:45,933 --> 02:20:48,705
it unlocks you, and I can
see some of you get this,

3149
02:20:48,705 --> 02:20:51,503
it's a big one, I'm sitting
here and I'm jamming

3150
02:20:51,503 --> 02:20:53,950
with you guys, I'm like,
ah, right, I'm always

3151
02:20:53,950 --> 02:20:57,516
trying to break down the
formula, because it's never

3152
02:20:57,516 --> 02:20:59,117
one thing, right?

3153
02:20:59,117 --> 02:21:03,143
It's like wine, a good wine
has a blend of components,

3154
02:21:03,143 --> 02:21:06,798
a lot of what works for me is
I do it for the right reasons,

3155
02:21:06,798 --> 02:21:09,935
I'm all in, I don't mind if
I lose, I actually weirdly

3156
02:21:09,935 --> 02:21:14,263
prefer it, and if I do great
for you and then I need you

3157
02:21:14,263 --> 02:21:18,242
in a year, and you don't
deliver, I'm cool with that too,

3158
02:21:18,242 --> 02:21:19,492
I'm empathetic.

3159
02:21:20,424 --> 02:21:23,720
Maybe you didn't get it, maybe
you're not a good person,

3160
02:21:23,720 --> 02:21:26,099
maybe you got some shit on
your mind that didn't allow

3161
02:21:26,099 --> 02:21:27,729
you to come through.

3162
02:21:27,729 --> 02:21:31,606
I think the expectation
of others and the opinions

3163
02:21:31,606 --> 02:21:35,427
of others are disproportionately
guiding your life

3164
02:21:35,427 --> 02:21:37,430
and I think that you will
end up regretting that

3165
02:21:37,430 --> 02:21:39,097
in your older years.

3166
02:21:40,642 --> 02:21:44,475
- [Audience Member] Thank
you, that was great.

3167
02:21:48,039 --> 02:21:51,533
- I never have to rush,
anybody, are we done?

3168
02:21:51,533 --> 02:21:53,037
- [Audience Member]
Yes, one more, one more.

3169
02:21:53,037 --> 02:21:54,620
- Yes, let's do it.

3170
02:21:57,297 --> 02:21:59,635
- [Audience Member] Hi,
so our company has done--

3171
02:21:59,635 --> 02:22:00,592
- What's your name?

3172
02:22:00,592 --> 02:22:01,425
- I'm Shell.

3173
02:22:01,425 --> 02:22:02,258
- [Gary] Shell?

3174
02:22:02,258 --> 02:22:05,425
- I'm from (mumbles).

3175
02:22:08,852 --> 02:22:11,181
So, our company is founded
on its culture and we hold

3176
02:22:11,181 --> 02:22:13,646
it very close to our hearts, and earlier

3177
02:22:13,646 --> 02:22:15,861
you were talking about
leadership and you were saying

3178
02:22:15,861 --> 02:22:19,472
that selflessness and
empathy is everything

3179
02:22:19,472 --> 02:22:22,859
when it comes to leadership,
and I just wanted to know

3180
02:22:22,859 --> 02:22:26,024
how has selflessness and
empathy impacted your life

3181
02:22:26,024 --> 02:22:29,059
and impacted your company
within your leadership?

3182
02:22:29,059 --> 02:22:33,226
- It's allowed me to, God,
that's such a good question,

3183
02:22:34,753 --> 02:22:38,920
Shell, it's almost like
asking me how has brown eyes

3184
02:22:40,635 --> 02:22:42,052
impacted my life?

3185
02:22:43,788 --> 02:22:47,285
I don't even know of anything else,

3186
02:22:47,285 --> 02:22:50,487
what I think it's done,
it's created a stickiness

3187
02:22:50,487 --> 02:22:53,975
and an emotion towards
me and the organization

3188
02:22:53,975 --> 02:22:56,604
that has created its strength.

3189
02:22:56,604 --> 02:23:00,597
I believe that continuity
leads to speed, speed leads

3190
02:23:00,597 --> 02:23:02,285
to results.

3191
02:23:02,285 --> 02:23:04,547
So, the reason I love
culture so much is it means

3192
02:23:04,547 --> 02:23:07,122
we stick around with each
other longer, so we know

3193
02:23:07,122 --> 02:23:08,865
each other's strengths
and weaknesses, we become

3194
02:23:08,865 --> 02:23:11,997
a gelled unit and then we
can be faster in whatever

3195
02:23:11,997 --> 02:23:15,903
we do, decisions, strategies, executions.

3196
02:23:15,903 --> 02:23:18,769
I'm a retailer, when
it's busy on a Saturday,

3197
02:23:18,769 --> 02:23:20,628
everything, everything.

3198
02:23:20,628 --> 02:23:23,041
So, for me, man, I think
it's impacted, I don't

3199
02:23:23,041 --> 02:23:25,508
there's an accident that
this company and my company

3200
02:23:25,508 --> 02:23:28,668
have hyper-grown very quickly
in comparison to other

3201
02:23:28,668 --> 02:23:30,472
people's companies, right?

3202
02:23:30,472 --> 02:23:33,880
I think that, I feel
like there's only one way

3203
02:23:33,880 --> 02:23:36,405
to make anybody besides the
person that owns something

3204
02:23:36,405 --> 02:23:39,106
give a shit, which is to
give a shit about them more

3205
02:23:39,106 --> 02:23:41,801
than they give a shit
about you, and in that,

3206
02:23:41,801 --> 02:23:43,935
creates the stickiness
that creates continuity

3207
02:23:43,935 --> 02:23:47,778
which creates speed and
my genuine belief about

3208
02:23:47,778 --> 02:23:50,904
everything else in business
is that speed is the variable

3209
02:23:50,904 --> 02:23:51,821
to success.

3210
02:23:53,696 --> 02:23:54,529
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

3211
02:23:54,529 --> 02:23:56,112
- You're welcome.

3212
02:23:56,112 --> 02:23:57,029
Dutch Bros.

3213
02:24:00,791 --> 02:24:02,846
Okay guys, so you sat down
and watched that entire

3214
02:24:02,846 --> 02:24:04,943
marathon which is insane.

3215
02:24:04,943 --> 02:24:06,830
So, the real simple
question of the day is,

3216
02:24:06,830 --> 02:24:10,575
what was your favorite
part of this keynote,

3217
02:24:10,575 --> 02:24:13,031
what made you feel the most,

3218
02:24:13,031 --> 02:24:15,698
what part can you feel the most?

3219
02:24:18,270 --> 00:00:00,000
(melodic music)
