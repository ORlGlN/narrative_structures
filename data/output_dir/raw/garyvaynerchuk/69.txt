1
00:00:00,307 --> 00:00:01,659
- The biggest problem is, you're right,

2
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:03,629
you're climbing up a
hill, that isn't gonna

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:05,132
be valuable when you get there.

4
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:06,987
- Right, right.

5
00:00:06,987 --> 00:00:08,709
- It's super not interesting to eat shit

6
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,954
for the next seven years, get there,

7
00:00:10,954 --> 00:00:12,896
and be like, (makes cartoon noise).

8
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:14,404
That's exactly what's gonna happen.

9
00:00:14,404 --> 00:00:16,987
(upbeat music)

10
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,980
(happy chiming)

11
00:00:51,908 --> 00:00:53,821
- How are you, Steve?
- Great, and yourself?

12
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:54,988
- Really good.

13
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,232
Yeah, anywhere.

14
00:00:57,232 --> 00:01:00,028
Don't worry about them, the vlog is easy.

15
00:01:00,028 --> 00:01:00,913
Did you guys meet Nate?

16
00:01:00,913 --> 00:01:02,391
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

17
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:04,336
So tell me what you guys are up to.

18
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:08,499
- Uh, well I'll try to be
as concise as possible,

19
00:01:08,499 --> 00:01:11,955
but obviously I retired three years ago--

20
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:13,765
- That goes fast, man.

21
00:01:13,765 --> 00:01:16,432
- Yeah, and it took me two years

22
00:01:17,396 --> 00:01:19,858
to kind of find balance again, in my life.

23
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:22,239
- To like just decompress from that?

24
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,406
- Yeah, I can't sit still.

25
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,994
I have a production company,

26
00:01:28,994 --> 00:01:31,240
and we've directed a 30 for 30,

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,331
we've done a bunch of digital content,

28
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:36,755
we are doing stuff in
filming television and--

29
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:38,033
- [Man] Sorry, are you Steve Nash?

30
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:39,323
- Yes.

31
00:01:39,323 --> 00:01:42,123
(group squeals)

32
00:01:42,123 --> 00:01:44,469
- Went through a soccer game, actually.

33
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:45,302
- [Host] You met at a soccer game.

34
00:01:45,302 --> 00:01:47,487
- I've been in LA for a year.

35
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:49,035
We played football together.

36
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:51,542
- But anyways, so, we're doing
film and television stuff,

37
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:53,130
and trying to figure out like,

38
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,588
what is it we really wanna do,

39
00:01:54,588 --> 00:01:55,980
and we've slowly started
to figure that out,

40
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,949
but at the same time, filming television,

41
00:01:57,949 --> 00:02:00,575
you're going up against the Titans,

42
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:02,715
guys who have been doing it for 30 years,

43
00:02:02,715 --> 00:02:04,253
there's ways to make in growings,

44
00:02:04,253 --> 00:02:05,484
but there's just such an upside

45
00:02:05,484 --> 00:02:07,476
to building something digital.

46
00:02:07,476 --> 00:02:09,568
- Yeah, I mean, the biggest problem

47
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,736
is you're right, you're climbing up a hill

48
00:02:11,736 --> 00:02:13,764
that isn't gonna be
valuable when you get there.

49
00:02:13,764 --> 00:02:14,597
- Right.

50
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:17,360
- It's super not interesting to eat shit

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,578
for the next seven years, get there,

52
00:02:19,578 --> 00:02:21,599
and be like (makes cartoon noise).

53
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,145
That's exactly what's gonna happen.

54
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,372
So you're like okay, let's not do that.

55
00:02:27,372 --> 00:02:28,859
- And then at the same time,

56
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:31,284
I've never really been one that like,

57
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,670
like there was a part of me that's like,

58
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,368
I maybe will just disappear,

59
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,609
and not be heard from again and my life.

60
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:39,236
Be with my kids, and do all the things

61
00:02:39,236 --> 00:02:41,823
that I wanna do, and just
kind of get away from it.

62
00:02:41,823 --> 00:02:43,475
But then I realized--

63
00:02:43,475 --> 00:02:44,598
- That's just not who you are.

64
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:45,848
- I enjoy life.

65
00:02:46,873 --> 00:02:48,594
- You're also young as shit.

66
00:02:48,594 --> 00:02:51,496
- I like traveling, I think
I do have something to say.

67
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:54,097
So I'm trying to find my voice

68
00:02:54,097 --> 00:02:56,211
in a way that we can be in control of it,

69
00:02:56,211 --> 00:03:00,982
we can be impactful,
transformative, sports content.

70
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:03,325
Has started to get exciting for me,

71
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:07,090
and then we've started to take
a step filming some stuff,

72
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,331
and conceiving some stuff,

73
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:10,374
and so, as I think I've heard you say,

74
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:12,418
to learn cheaply, earn the way.

75
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:14,279
So, I think that's right now,

76
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:16,104
is we're trying to fill a platform,

77
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:19,003
that initially starts around my life,

78
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:20,966
you know, whether it's vlogs, or podcasts,

79
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:23,801
or little series that we conceive of,

80
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,039
but that hopefully, it starts to bring

81
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,997
in other athletes and people.

82
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:28,414
- Yeah, man, yes.

83
00:03:29,448 --> 00:03:31,818
Yeah, build the leverage, and then decide

84
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:35,092
where you wanna put all that attention,

85
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:38,434
whether it's through something like,

86
00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:42,795
your version of the ESPN bar
stool, or Players Tribune,

87
00:03:42,795 --> 00:03:46,719
mixed with TED, and I think you if you can

88
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,342
spend a year, 18 months,
building up your personal brand,

89
00:03:50,342 --> 00:03:53,216
creating content exactly how you said it,

90
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,753
whether the vlog and the podcast

91
00:03:54,753 --> 00:03:58,266
are the main pillars, or
the podcast, or the vlog,

92
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:00,523
surround it with other stuff,

93
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:03,793
and then really read the tea leaves

94
00:04:03,793 --> 00:04:06,548
and see who's reaching
out to you from your

95
00:04:06,548 --> 00:04:08,735
first chapter of your life,

96
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:13,091
who's emerging and interested
in this new chapter.

97
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:18,081
It's funny, learn cheaply, must
make mistakes at low costs,

98
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:21,659
but more importantly,
gather enormous amounts

99
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:23,909
of quant and qual feedback,

100
00:04:25,952 --> 00:04:26,809
and the other thing is also,

101
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:29,165
recognizing in 24 months,
there may be a slight

102
00:04:29,165 --> 00:04:31,834
spin on it that you don't know yet,

103
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:36,008
or taste yet, or it's
literally one story, from one--

104
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:37,345
You know?
- Yeah.

105
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:38,878
- One former teammate, or somebody else,

106
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,122
or a guy or a kid on the street

107
00:04:40,122 --> 00:04:42,757
that stops you, that could end up becoming

108
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:45,326
the anchor of the framework.

109
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,419
So the thing with the
vlog, that I would tell you

110
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:49,034
is super important to me,

111
00:04:49,034 --> 00:04:50,875
as the first thing about this meeting,

112
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,322
you need to go fast,
there are still not famous

113
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:55,788
people really vlogging.

114
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:57,195
- Right, so before it catches on--

115
00:04:57,195 --> 00:04:58,638
- Yeah, the same reason Ashton won

116
00:04:58,638 --> 00:05:02,875
so big on twitter, the same
reason Khalid won on Snapchat,

117
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,867
there's not a lot of,
I mean, I don't know.

118
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:09,514
Gavin, I'm so busy, but I don't feel

119
00:05:09,514 --> 00:05:13,405
like there's no athlete of your caliber

120
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:15,726
that I can think of that
is vlogging, for real.

121
00:05:15,726 --> 00:05:18,797
- [Man] Yeah, bits of
clips come out on internet,

122
00:05:18,797 --> 00:05:20,269
and stuff like that, but--

123
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:22,578
- Yeah, I mean, I'm super
close with Maverick,

124
00:05:22,578 --> 00:05:26,086
and all that, but that's
not him on YouTube

125
00:05:26,086 --> 00:05:28,453
with no subscribers at first,

126
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,277
being like hey, like really doing it.

127
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:33,686
That's fucking crazy, and then again,

128
00:05:33,686 --> 00:05:35,519
all these characters--

129
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:40,600
When you're actually famous,

130
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,114
and you actually played basketball,

131
00:05:42,114 --> 00:05:46,755
I mean like, half the
vloggers that are doing well,

132
00:05:46,755 --> 00:05:48,657
I'm talking like the Paul Brothers,

133
00:05:48,657 --> 00:05:51,476
and all these crazy
characters that I know,

134
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,124
them sitting there being like,

135
00:05:53,124 --> 00:05:55,627
"Is Steve Nash actually
vlogging on YouTube?"

136
00:05:55,627 --> 00:05:58,809
Followed by, "Holy shit,
let's reach out to him,

137
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:01,579
"and do like a 3-point
contest in my back yard."

138
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:02,912
Is like, insane.

139
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,962
Especially in LA, they're all,

140
00:06:05,962 --> 00:06:06,940
like people overthink it,

141
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,853
they think if the first
episode isn't right,

142
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:10,527
you can't mess up.

143
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:13,001
- Go on to the next, this
new cycle's so (mumbles).

144
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:16,402
- Like, the ideal tweet is like,

145
00:06:16,402 --> 00:06:18,727
Holy shit, I listened to
Steve Nash's first podcast,

146
00:06:18,727 --> 00:06:21,613
it sucked, episode 17 with Antoine Walker,

147
00:06:21,613 --> 00:06:25,419
how he lost all his money, is insane.

148
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,252
You can't lose.
- Yeah.

149
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:31,880
- The only way you can
lose is by not recognizing

150
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,286
how few people that look
like you have done it,

151
00:06:34,286 --> 00:06:35,872
and then letting two of them,

152
00:06:35,872 --> 00:06:38,012
I mean, everybody's
having this conversation.

153
00:06:38,012 --> 00:06:41,750
Like, everybody kinda
knows something's going on.

154
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,846
- It's who gets out there first,

155
00:06:42,846 --> 00:06:43,916
and yeah, you're right, I mean,

156
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:44,916
I think we--

157
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:48,852
It's not a box set, right?

158
00:06:48,852 --> 00:06:51,719
It's not gonna go like in a library,

159
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:53,632
you want to connect with an audience,

160
00:06:53,632 --> 00:06:54,899
and keep connecting with them,

161
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:57,078
and learn to connect better,
and keeping on to them.

162
00:06:57,078 --> 00:06:58,113
- This is not a game won by the way

163
00:06:58,113 --> 00:07:00,316
Star wars is won, it's
not special affects,

164
00:07:00,316 --> 00:07:03,256
it's just not, it's not
the game we're playing.

165
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,564
What's cool about it is,

166
00:07:04,564 --> 00:07:06,579
if you do this game
right, you have unlimited

167
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:09,241
ability to do Star Wars, if you want.

168
00:07:09,241 --> 00:07:10,286
- Right.

169
00:07:10,286 --> 00:07:12,099
- Like true family, I
was pumped when you said,

170
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:12,932
can I bring my guy?

171
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,823
I'm like perfect, I'm bringing Nate.

172
00:07:14,823 --> 00:07:17,969
This is not a joke, at some
point in the last 18 months

173
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:19,596
or so, or two years
ago, or three years ago,

174
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:21,766
Nate's like, "There's three
people I need you to become

175
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:26,182
"friends with, Steve Nash, John
Mayor, and Phil Nickelson."

176
00:07:26,182 --> 00:07:28,340
And this is not a joke, I
become friends with all three

177
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,771
this year.

178
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:31,438
It was the craziest.

179
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,733
Hold on.

180
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,481
- Sweet, thanks.

181
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:37,785
(people talking over one another)

182
00:07:37,785 --> 00:07:39,686
- [Man] Safe travels, everybody.

183
00:07:39,686 --> 00:07:41,081
- [Host] Have a great holiday, man.

184
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:41,914
- [Man] Bye, guys!

185
00:07:41,914 --> 00:07:43,331
- Bye, take care!

186
00:07:46,771 --> 00:07:47,808
Great meeting with Steve Nash,

187
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:49,577
what a great fuckin' dude.

188
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:53,077
Love meeting like, dudes that are awesome.

189
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,148
Getting towards the end of the year vlog,

190
00:07:58,148 --> 00:08:00,047
super excited to see what
the team does for you guys

191
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,758
in these two weeks that I'm away,

192
00:08:01,758 --> 00:08:03,070

193
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,000
Got some stuff, just wrapping up the year,

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,090

contracts signed for 2018,

195
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,545
VaynerMedia's looking
real, real, real good.

196
00:08:10,545 --> 00:08:12,394
Coming out the gate hard.

197
00:08:12,394 --> 00:08:15,214
With a new book on the
30th, excited about that.

198
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:18,758
Got a bunch of conferences, agent 20/21,

199
00:08:18,758 --> 00:08:21,890

200
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,453
Vayner Sports Party, couple weeks later,

201
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:27,641
NBA all-star weekend, Vayner Sports Party,

202
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,488
got two new sneakers coming out,

203
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:34,115

predominantly 96% Vayner X,

204
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:38,193
pure wow, Vayner Media,
real hard core focus

205
00:08:38,193 --> 00:08:40,138
for me next year.

206
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:42,041
Excited about it.

207
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:45,291
Genuinely excited about next year, man.

208
00:08:46,882 --> 00:08:48,865
(spits)

209
00:08:48,865 --> 00:08:50,398
Show that part, I wanna
hear all the comments.

210
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:52,481
(grunts)

211
00:08:54,488 --> 00:08:57,871
So here's what we're gonna
have to figure out, right?

212
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,724
Even though, I feel the way about you

213
00:08:59,724 --> 00:09:02,619
that I felt with my wife, I'm gonna need

214
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:04,558
a couple of months of us jamming, right?

215
00:09:04,558 --> 00:09:05,960
I also wanna know them a little bit.

216
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,348
So what we need to think about is,

217
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,359
I hear you loud and clear,

218
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:12,717
and I love the way
you're talking about it,

219
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:15,087
I need to figure out the vibes.

220
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,254
We need to figure out how,

221
00:09:18,113 --> 00:09:20,702
there's so much good here,
right, there's so many

222
00:09:20,702 --> 00:09:22,285
ways to slice this.

223
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:25,010
I need to be thoughtful of like,

224
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,081
I gotta feel comfortable
and then I can go fast,

225
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:28,070
you know what I mean?

226
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,653
(upbeat music)

227
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:38,562
- Ah, how you doing man?

228
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:41,336
- Good, brother, how are you?

229
00:09:41,336 --> 00:09:42,169
- Feeling okay?

230
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:44,203
- I feel amazing, you
look insane, brother.

231
00:09:44,203 --> 00:09:46,818
I mean, I see it online, but--

232
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:49,213
to see it in person makes
me so fuckin' happy.

233
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,965
- Man, just like, your words resonated

234
00:09:51,965 --> 00:09:54,713
so much with me, just cause,

235
00:09:54,713 --> 00:09:57,117
I mean, I've always like--

236
00:09:57,117 --> 00:09:59,534
It's like you have disciples.

237
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:01,817
- I'm aware.

238
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,793
A funny thing happens
when you speak the truth.

239
00:10:06,793 --> 00:10:08,876
(laughs)

240
00:10:10,894 --> 00:10:11,727
- Yeah.

241
00:10:11,727 --> 00:10:12,995
- You know?
- Yeah.

242
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:14,938
- When you speak the
truth with no expectation,

243
00:10:14,938 --> 00:10:19,077
or wants in return, and
mine's not like religious,

244
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,433
or altruistic, mine's more predicated

245
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:23,320
on my ability to get mine,

246
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,122
and being brought up in a way that,

247
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:28,090
my mom and I were talking
about this the other day,

248
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:31,169
of just like, I'm so similar
to my mom in a lot of ways,

249
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:32,593
and I got certain things of my dad,

250
00:10:32,593 --> 00:10:34,369
and that's how I become me,

251
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:36,383
we don't want anything from anybody,

252
00:10:36,383 --> 00:10:39,546
everything's our fault,
we're very insular,

253
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:40,879
um, I know, man.

254
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:44,209
- Mm-hm.

255
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:46,187
- The best part is when
you get to interact

256
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,029
with somebody you know, like,

257
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:51,593
there's millions of people
eventually I'll never know,

258
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:53,292
but to your point of eight years,

259
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:55,480
it's like, I was thinking about it today,

260
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,080
when we were like, we're
gonna make it happen.

261
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,478
Just thinking about all
the silly conversations

262
00:11:00,478 --> 00:11:04,028
through the years,
building mix-tapes, and--

263
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:05,445
- Travis Porter--
- Travis Porter,

264
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:07,581
I always think about those stories.

265
00:11:07,581 --> 00:11:08,435
You know?

266
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,226
And then just watching your whole like,

267
00:11:10,226 --> 00:11:12,733
when you started running,
like one of those videos

268
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:15,792
really caught me, when
you were like ready to go,

269
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:18,631
and now you look, I mean,
people don't even recognize you,

270
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:19,464
I'm sure.

271
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:22,445
Like, you roll up on
people, they're like, what?

272
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:24,067
(laughs)

273
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:24,900
Right?

274
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,733
- Yeah, I almost didn't recognize you

275
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:27,021
when you walked through the main lobby.

276
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,330
And I saw you like a month ago,

277
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,349
like he's really training.

278
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:31,932
- When I was young,

279
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:36,768
like, I always wanted to be an athlete,

280
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:41,713
that was like my core,
true, rolled in truth.

281
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,859
Like, I'm gonna be an athlete.

282
00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:48,550
But then I was always the big kid.

283
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,585
And like, I loved basketball,

284
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,897
and church versus skins, as a kid,

285
00:11:52,897 --> 00:11:54,973
like I'd have to drop down like,

286
00:11:54,973 --> 00:11:57,672
if they picked skins, I'm
gonna be able to play,

287
00:11:57,672 --> 00:11:59,440
and then the pool never took my--

288
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,273
- Sure.

289
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:02,010
- So I needed something to be good at,

290
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,260
growing up, so, it's like when you want

291
00:12:07,398 --> 00:12:10,029
girls to like you, you've
gotta have something

292
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:14,664
that you, and, um, I was like,
I'm gonna be in business.

293
00:12:14,664 --> 00:12:17,709
Like, I'm CEO Charlie, like young age,

294
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:20,540
I'm CEO Charlie, and, at that early age,

295
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,701
I varied what I truly wanted to be,

296
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,401
and I did business, and I got good at it.

297
00:12:25,401 --> 00:12:29,644
And as the business grew,
you know, like, I grew.

298
00:12:29,644 --> 00:12:31,277
(laughs)

299
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:34,860
And it's got up over,
you know, 300 pounds,

300
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:39,244
and this guy Cameron,

301
00:12:39,244 --> 00:12:41,764
he came into my life, and
he was the most amazing man.

302
00:12:41,764 --> 00:12:43,486
He said I like see something in you,

303
00:12:43,486 --> 00:12:47,833
but like, he was like,
you can't diet anymore,

304
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,884
because I can tell your brain is fried

305
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:51,476
from always doing diets,

306
00:12:51,476 --> 00:12:55,071
he said we're gonna run,
so we did three marathons,

307
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:57,952
and from the first
marathon to third marathon,

308
00:12:57,952 --> 00:12:59,714
I gained weight.

309
00:12:59,714 --> 00:13:00,547
- Really?

310
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,673
- Yes, cause I was a binge eater,

311
00:13:03,673 --> 00:13:07,275
like I would run, and
I could run 26.2 miles,

312
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:11,422
but then, I'd crack, and I'd
eat 10,000 calories in a night.

313
00:13:11,422 --> 00:13:13,273
I knew something was wrong,
but I didn't know what

314
00:13:13,273 --> 00:13:17,634
was wrong, and one day,
I woke up and the room

315
00:13:17,634 --> 00:13:19,563
just started spinning.

316
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:22,922
And this is when he was doing
the Dab and stand sweaters,

317
00:13:22,922 --> 00:13:25,515
they were like killing the whole game.

318
00:13:25,515 --> 00:13:27,157
- Yeah, like, I wake up--

319
00:13:27,157 --> 00:13:30,037
- Right, you're at the
top of your business game.

320
00:13:30,037 --> 00:13:34,139
- Never sad, never, wake
up, room is spinning,

321
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:37,248
I'm like oh, this isn't good.

322
00:13:37,248 --> 00:13:41,355
And then I got outta bed,
went to pick up the shoes,

323
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:42,272
passed out.

324
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:45,333
- Woke up where?

325
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,273
- On the floor!

326
00:13:46,273 --> 00:13:47,290
- But you woke up there?

327
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,213
Not in a hospital or anything?

328
00:13:48,213 --> 00:13:49,046
- No, no, no.

329
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:49,879
- And?

330
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:54,175
- Went to the doctor,
brain tumor wrapped around

331
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:57,436
left optic nerve, coronary artery,

332
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:01,603
it could start corroding
the top of my spinal cord.

333
00:14:04,253 --> 00:14:07,836
At that point, it's
like, when you gave me,

334
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,230
like my secret sword to go slay my dragon.

335
00:14:14,097 --> 00:14:17,764
Like, I'm like, I'm
gonna change everything.

336
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,060
This is something lasting.

337
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,622
I'm gonna change everything.

338
00:14:23,622 --> 00:14:26,085
And I knew everything had to change,

339
00:14:26,085 --> 00:14:30,252
and I left my company, and
said I'm gonna do an Iron Man.

340
00:14:32,174 --> 00:14:34,475
And I said, I'm gonna reverse
the brain tumor naturally,

341
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:37,013
because I'm not doing chemo,

342
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:40,207
and this medication that
the doctors have me on,

343
00:14:40,207 --> 00:14:43,500
affects your heart valves,
that's when I said,

344
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,208
I'm gonna do an Iron Man,
and I just started going.

345
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:50,193
I went vegan, plant-based,
and reversing it naturally,

346
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:51,747
like my brain tumor's shrinking

347
00:14:51,747 --> 00:14:52,823
because of the food I eat.

348
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:54,332
- I get it, brother.

349
00:14:54,332 --> 00:14:55,619
I believe in that shit.

350
00:14:55,619 --> 00:14:57,452
In a real fuckin' way.

351
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:03,958
- When I'm on my bike rides,

352
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:08,365
like, I did 112 mile bike
ride from Atlanta to Alabama,

353
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,698
and back, and I got through,

354
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:18,214
I think like 37 episodes of Daily V.

355
00:15:18,214 --> 00:15:20,047
Like, when I say like,

356
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,410
I had to change everything
I was consuming.

357
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,533
Not just food, but like what you consume.

358
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:32,344
Literally, it's like, when I
say you gave me that sword,

359
00:15:32,344 --> 00:15:35,866
to slay my dragon, I'm taking
the biggest risk of my life,

360
00:15:35,866 --> 00:15:40,029
like, when I left my
company, this was scary.

361
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:41,189
- Hell yeah, it's scary.

362
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:42,521
Cause it's your truth.

363
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:44,604
- Talk about eating dirt,

364
00:15:47,886 --> 00:15:49,671
millionaire, now I live
with four roommates.

365
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:53,010
Because I know, I'm smart
enough to know like,

366
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,722
okay, where I'm going,
I wanna be an athlete,

367
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:57,972
that's not just like clear,

368
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:00,196
I'm a good businessman, I've always been

369
00:16:00,196 --> 00:16:02,504
a good businessman, but my dream,

370
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:05,668
that eight year old truth,
before I put all this

371
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:08,251
society stuff on me, this mask,

372
00:16:09,462 --> 00:16:11,196
I wanna be an athlete.

373
00:16:11,196 --> 00:16:14,157
So I'm eating dirt, I know I'm gonna die,

374
00:16:14,157 --> 00:16:16,657
now I'm gonna live, like damn.

375
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,039
(laughs)

376
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,289
Thank you, man.

377
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:23,944
I need to confirm something with you.

378
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:24,777
- Go ahead.

379
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:27,526
- So, my friends, you
know, there's some people

380
00:16:27,526 --> 00:16:29,540
that like you, and some
people who don't, right?

381
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,990
- Oh me, yeah, yeah, yeah.

382
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,479
Of course.

383
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:35,885
- And I wanna know if this is right?

384
00:16:35,885 --> 00:16:36,718
- Go ahead.

385
00:16:36,718 --> 00:16:38,918
- True or false, for me to
speak on your behalf to people.

386
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:42,081
And they're like, man, is he happy?

387
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:44,430
- And I'm like, you know what,

388
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,597
this is my theory on Gary.

389
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:51,654
My grandparents were
immigrants from Lebanon.

390
00:16:51,654 --> 00:16:54,497
And they had your mentality, not success,

391
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:56,001
but mentality, like immigrants,

392
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:59,918
like they're not worried
about, they are happy.

393
00:17:03,735 --> 00:17:05,204
In their mission.

394
00:17:05,204 --> 00:17:08,615
- Oh, so the questions of the
friends, or acquaintances is,

395
00:17:08,616 --> 00:17:11,009
am I happy because I'm always working?

396
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:13,778
- Like I think that is
what makes you happy,

397
00:17:13,778 --> 00:17:16,118
because I know that's what
made my grandparents happy,

398
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,282
they weren't worried about "happiness"--

399
00:17:18,282 --> 00:17:22,449
- I'm absolutely, like, that
makes a lot of sense to me,

400
00:17:23,673 --> 00:17:26,356
that's a valid question for people

401
00:17:26,356 --> 00:17:29,439
that value other things, it's values.

402
00:17:30,513 --> 00:17:34,877
Like, nothing makes me
happier than building.

403
00:17:34,877 --> 00:17:35,928
- Mm-hmm.

404
00:17:35,928 --> 00:17:38,078
- Nothing makes me happier than building,

405
00:17:38,078 --> 00:17:41,503
in a way that also builds
up people along the way,

406
00:17:41,503 --> 00:17:42,836
as I'm building.

407
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:46,838
Yeah, I mean, listen, I love working.

408
00:17:46,838 --> 00:17:48,088
Like, I get it.

409
00:17:49,514 --> 00:17:51,264
My big thing is that,

410
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:57,406
I think people need to be
smart about what they say,

411
00:17:57,406 --> 00:17:58,239
you know?

412
00:17:59,104 --> 00:18:01,974
Like, to me, the person that's
far more unhappy than I am,

413
00:18:01,974 --> 00:18:05,575
is the one that says, that their CEO,

414
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:07,148
or they're hustling and they're not.

415
00:18:07,148 --> 00:18:09,377
I think anybody is happy when they're

416
00:18:09,377 --> 00:18:12,885
living their truth,
including the verse of me.

417
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:16,398
I think the people that I
notice that are most happy,

418
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:18,331
that remind me of me, are actually people

419
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,409
that aren't working that much.

420
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:23,072
That have found their work/life balance.

421
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:25,934
I grew up in a very lower/middle-class,

422
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:28,431
I have very interesting
point of reference,

423
00:18:28,431 --> 00:18:32,236
which is, the happiest
person I saw growing up,

424
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,614
were my parents who worked like dogs,

425
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:35,667
both my mom in the house,

426
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:39,667
my dad outside, and random
people that were like

427
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:43,918
friends' parents that
were making 47k a year,

428
00:18:43,918 --> 00:18:46,411
and they just liked drinking Budweiser

429
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:50,578
and watching the game, and
like kept it simple as fuck.

430
00:18:51,607 --> 00:18:55,774
I think people find happiness
in extremes, I really do.

431
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,065
I think when you're half pregnant,

432
00:18:59,065 --> 00:19:03,863
you're stuck, that's why
making a hundred, 10,000 a year

433
00:19:03,863 --> 00:19:06,926
scares me, like it feels middle.

434
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:08,902
- Yeah, I'd also say, you know,

435
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:11,182
Gary has a great family, he has two kids,

436
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:13,663
and he loves football, so even to answer

437
00:19:13,663 --> 00:19:16,527
a few of your questions, there
are things that aren't worth,

438
00:19:16,527 --> 00:19:17,975
you know what I mean?

439
00:19:17,975 --> 00:19:20,082
They're like, it's like a big
part of your life, you know?

440
00:19:20,082 --> 00:19:22,654
- Honestly, I'm just
happy people are talking.

441
00:19:22,654 --> 00:19:24,089
- Well yeah, if you're successful,

442
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:25,309
people are gonna say that stuff.

443
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:29,357
- No, listen, very few
people come at me with real

444
00:19:29,357 --> 00:19:34,037
heat or anger, if they do,
they're just in a bad place,

445
00:19:34,037 --> 00:19:36,976
listen, I'm working much
harder than most people.

446
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,781
That's just the truth.

447
00:19:38,781 --> 00:19:40,264
And I think that fucks with people,

448
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:41,916
especially when I started the vlog,

449
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,166
and there became no debate.

450
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:46,368
But I did that on purpose,

451
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:48,673
cause I know there's a lot of people,

452
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:49,997
honestly, there's a lot of immigrants

453
00:19:49,997 --> 00:19:51,528
who can outwork the competition.

454
00:19:51,528 --> 00:19:54,651
Or, where the fuck are you two from?

455
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,270
You don't need to be an immigrant,

456
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,593
like there's a lot of people that live

457
00:19:58,593 --> 00:20:00,159
like immigrants that are born here,

458
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:02,992
like, yeah, I think I mean for me,

459
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,791
brother, I'm living my truth, you know?

460
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:11,124
Honestly, I'm most unhappy when I'm

461
00:20:11,124 --> 00:20:13,252
doing the most normal shit.

462
00:20:13,252 --> 00:20:16,332
(man mumbling in background)

463
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:18,314
- I'm only happy in my extremes.

464
00:20:18,314 --> 00:20:20,487
Just living your truth, man.

465
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:21,860
Right?

466
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,931
But the fact that you
tapped into yourself,

467
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:27,264
and executed, you know how rare that is?

468
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:30,482
- Thank you, man.

469
00:20:30,482 --> 00:20:33,919
- People are scared to live their truth.

470
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,531
Because they're worried about
all the other variables.

471
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:39,889
That's why your world is so extreme,

472
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:42,472
you went so hardcore both ways.

473
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:44,945
It's good to see you, man.

474
00:20:44,945 --> 00:20:46,878
- Thank you, man, thank you for time, too.

475
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,279
- Of course, man.

476
00:20:48,279 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
