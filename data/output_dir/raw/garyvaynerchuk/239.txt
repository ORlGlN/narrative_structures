1
00:00:00,264 --> 00:00:02,079
- Straight up, for 90% of you,

2
00:00:02,079 --> 00:00:04,809
this is the greatest year
of your life right now.

3
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:06,642
That's just the truth.

4
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:10,551
(upbeat rap music)

5
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:21,617
(upbeat music)

6
00:00:57,652 --> 00:00:59,386
Just landed in L.A.

7
00:00:59,386 --> 00:01:01,566
I'm going to talk with
the USC football team.

8
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:05,733
Just called Colin on the
team now to do some articles.

9
00:01:09,048 --> 00:01:11,549
Hey Colin, how are you?

10
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,456
Super well, real quick, when
you say brand put your brand,

11
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:19,908
your product, your service, your business.

12
00:01:19,908 --> 00:01:21,002
You know what I mean?

13
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:23,605
When you say document there,
you're gonna link that

14
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:25,657
word document to document and create?

15
00:01:25,657 --> 00:01:26,533
- [Colin] Yes.

16
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:27,366
- Okay keep going.

17
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:28,882
Ah, what you say interesting like

18
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:32,299
a media company ad or end or a publisher.

19
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:34,433
Got it?

20
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:38,600
And brand is everything
if you're trying to create

21
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,684
a business of value.

22
00:01:44,455 --> 00:01:48,622
Now in the modern digital
landscape instead of social.

23
00:01:51,593 --> 00:01:53,093
That's how you make it.

24
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:55,587
One of the reasons I want
to write this article is,

25
00:01:55,587 --> 00:01:58,667
I think people see that alfa anger

26
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:00,696
competitiveness, hunger.

27
00:02:00,696 --> 00:02:01,529
You know how?

28
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:03,195
Go to fuckin Google, dick.

29
00:02:03,195 --> 00:02:06,577
(audience laughter)

30
00:02:06,577 --> 00:02:09,851
And they misunderstand that
it is under the context

31
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:12,851
and the guise of the business scheme

32
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:15,241
not overall life.

33
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:19,563
I don't even know if I want to
position it with that title.

34
00:02:19,563 --> 00:02:23,730
I think it's more about
dissecting being misunderstood.

35
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,649
We need to make it more
of a macro-conversation

36
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:29,528
of everybody being misunderstood.

37
00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:32,809
Like for me, this is less
about a piece of content

38
00:02:32,809 --> 00:02:35,358
that I want out there for me to point to

39
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:37,445
and more of a piece of content to empower

40
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:39,998
people to keep doing their thing,

41
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:42,159
because a lot of them
are not doing their thing

42
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,152
because of other people's opinions.

43
00:02:44,152 --> 00:02:46,835
For me, I'm empathetic to being

44
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:49,168
misunderstood not combative.

45
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:55,212
Hey Tony, it's Gary
Vaynerchuk, how are you?

46
00:02:55,212 --> 00:02:57,651
Good how is your summer going so far?

47
00:02:57,651 --> 00:02:59,933
So I want to talk to you
about the creative pillar

48
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:02,170
and the pros and cons of
where you want to take it

49
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,040
creatively and we'll have that

50
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,172
conversation right after this.

51
00:03:04,172 --> 00:03:06,136
The part that you can count on me is

52
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:08,755
you will be able to go to Long Island city

53
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:13,023
to our podcast studio and that
is literally where you can,

54
00:03:13,023 --> 00:03:14,625
we will set it up for you.

55
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,239
we will design the logo for you,

56
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,739
we will get you on the iTunes and Spotify,

57
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:24,172
all the Google platforms.

58
00:03:26,394 --> 00:03:28,764
We'll give you the kind
of one on one of how

59
00:03:28,764 --> 00:03:30,266
to get people to listen to it

60
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,097
and where you send people.

61
00:03:32,097 --> 00:03:34,722
We'll do podcasts in a box for you.

62
00:03:34,722 --> 00:03:36,783
All you will really need to do

63
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,198
is just come to the studio
and tell your guests

64
00:03:39,198 --> 00:03:43,041
to come to the studio, record and leave.

65
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,624
(upbeat music)

66
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,162
What's the best and the
worst part of being a CEO?

67
00:03:56,162 --> 00:03:59,052
Which is everything is on
you, the ups and the downs.

68
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:00,717
Let's use Anchor from afar,

69
00:04:00,717 --> 00:04:02,537
we don't each other
that well but I followed

70
00:04:02,537 --> 00:04:04,645
Anchor very closely from the beginning.

71
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,532
You came out the gate
and then there's that

72
00:04:06,532 --> 00:04:09,865
two to three weeks when everybody
was on your nuts, right?

73
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:11,170
You were gonna be this thing

74
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,489
and it was exciting and it was
the first time you did this.

75
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:15,883
And you're like, oh man, what
the hell am I dealing with?

76
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:18,043
Gary V's talking about it,
all these people are talking

77
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:20,374
about it, VC's are coming at me.

78
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,792
Real people I looked up
to in tech care about me

79
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:25,171
are on the platform and then for everybody

80
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:26,736
who's listening, tell them what's happened

81
00:04:26,736 --> 00:04:28,552
over the last 12 to 15 months.

82
00:04:28,552 --> 00:04:31,134
You had that high and then they low comes

83
00:04:31,134 --> 00:04:33,425
and you're trying to build the product

84
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:35,526
and the articles aren't
being written about it

85
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,285
and you actually have to operate

86
00:04:37,285 --> 00:04:40,121
and you actually have to
build something successful.

87
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:42,273
There's a lot of
competition and there's the

88
00:04:42,273 --> 00:04:44,491
other flavors of the week, right?

89
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:47,274
So like the loneliness of that is real.

90
00:04:47,274 --> 00:04:50,865
I assume from afar, one
week you're like oh my God

91
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:53,066
I'm the next Instagram and then a week

92
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:55,074
later the market doesn't care.

93
00:04:55,074 --> 00:04:57,967
And that's what entrepreneurs
have to deal with.

94
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:01,061
Everybody's excited when
they start their company.

95
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:02,867
What happens a month later?

96
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,362
The answer to my question is,

97
00:05:04,362 --> 00:05:06,214
I try my damnedest.

98
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:07,440
I think about it everyday.

99
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,587
I obsess over my business every second.

100
00:05:09,587 --> 00:05:11,985
I obsess over, am I doing
the right thing as a parent,

101
00:05:11,985 --> 00:05:15,807
as a father, as a husband, as a brother,

102
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:18,474
as a son, as a human to society?

103
00:05:19,412 --> 00:05:21,608
And you let the friction of that ambition

104
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:23,947
play out everyday and some days you win

105
00:05:23,947 --> 00:05:25,964
and some days you lose

106
00:05:25,964 --> 00:05:27,579
but you never give a fuck what anybody

107
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:30,246
thinks about your wins or loses.

108
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:35,157
And confidence goes in funny places.

109
00:05:35,157 --> 00:05:37,600
We're doing this interview,
I would tell you,

110
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,171
listen, I love you and love
this platform so I'm doing it

111
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:42,642
but it's not the biggest
interview of my life, right?

112
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,475
And I gotta tell you,
your phone call comes in

113
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:46,917
and I know it's a hidden
number 'cause I've been

114
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:49,060
playing with your platform
so I knew it was you.

115
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,686
And it's so weird what
went through my mind

116
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:53,854
which is, I literally,
this just went through

117
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,602
my mind, I'm about to give the

118
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:58,435
best Anchor interview of all time.

119
00:06:00,848 --> 00:06:01,752
Yeah, it's like one of my most

120
00:06:01,752 --> 00:06:04,669
watched YouTube videos of all time.

121
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:07,671
But it was maybe the
entrepreneurial class.

122
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:08,931
Let's start with this.

123
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:12,286
I fully, 100,000 percent with no hedge,

124
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:15,097
do not believe that you
can teach entrepreneurship,

125
00:06:15,097 --> 00:06:17,180
right, so that's awkward.

126
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:23,276
(crowd talking)

127
00:06:23,276 --> 00:06:25,780
- [Woman] Already got a
(mumbles) guy for you Gary.

128
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,886
- How are you?

129
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,274
- I've never been happier.

130
00:06:28,274 --> 00:06:29,358
(laughter)

131
00:06:29,358 --> 00:06:30,416
- (mumbles) boosters.

132
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,249
- How's it going?

133
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:32,230
- [Man] Awesome.

134
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,174
- [Gary] Life is good?

135
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:34,007
- Oh, yeah.

136
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:34,840
- Good.

137
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,157
- Where you from originally?

138
00:06:36,157 --> 00:06:38,398
- I was actually born in Russia.

139
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,231
- Okay.

140
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:40,766
- Beautiful facility, huh?

141
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,018
- Yeah.

142
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:44,435
- You know how to do it here.

143
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:48,698
(crowds talking)

144
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,279
(laughter)

145
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,326
But the reality is,
that's your reality right?

146
00:06:57,326 --> 00:06:58,848
You know that that's the reality

147
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:01,434
but to your point, there's
nothing against collecting

148
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:04,469
business cards, it's
only about relationships.

149
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:07,953
You need to dap it up with
as many people as possible.

150
00:07:07,953 --> 00:07:09,778
Life is only about the people.

151
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:12,329
I made tens of millions of dollars

152
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:13,600
because I became friendly...

153
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,611
I thought Twitter was gonna be important

154
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:18,104
and I made those relationships

155
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,784
with those founders and that's
what opened up everything.

156
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:23,878
Everybody you talk to
ever, ever that's made it,

157
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:26,689
that really made it,
it's just relationships.

158
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:30,547
I would meet every single
person, siphon and learn.

159
00:07:30,547 --> 00:07:33,564
They want to see you 'cause
they want to take a selfie

160
00:07:33,564 --> 00:07:35,643
and show their 14 year
old son they know you.

161
00:07:35,643 --> 00:07:38,788
You want to see them
because you wanna win life.

162
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:42,365
- I think you have to have
a balance to it too though.

163
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:45,032
(upbeat music)

164
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:59,803
- For me it's gratitude.

165
00:07:59,803 --> 00:08:01,720
I'm super grateful man.

166
00:08:04,356 --> 00:08:06,455
I was born in a shit place.

167
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:09,641
Got out of Russia when
nobody was getting out.

168
00:08:09,641 --> 00:08:11,641
Got lucky, I'm grateful.

169
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:17,469
If I wake up and everybody
in my family is alive,

170
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:18,948
I'm so fuckin fired up.

171
00:08:18,948 --> 00:08:21,580
I don't watch shit, I
don't listen to shit.

172
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,163
I'm just like, I'm so grateful.

173
00:08:25,861 --> 00:08:27,633
Yogi, like a fuck,

174
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,958
I just like, you know I
don't know what else to say.

175
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:30,791
I'm just super...

176
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,703
I'm part of this non-profit,
Pencils of Promise.

177
00:08:32,703 --> 00:08:35,525
I took some of my people
and went to Ghana.

178
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:38,642
Went to Ghana, landed in Acra
and then drove four hours.

179
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,995
These were places people walk
an hour to get fresh water.

180
00:08:41,995 --> 00:08:43,825
That man's water bottle there,

181
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:46,118
they would fuckin die for that shit.

182
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:48,231
I just think everybody's lost perspective.

183
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:51,147
And I'm real empathetic that
this room's lost perspective.

184
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:53,317
You're a football player of USC.

185
00:08:53,317 --> 00:08:55,687
Your perspective is broke.

186
00:08:55,687 --> 00:08:58,311
It just is, so I like try to unwind.

187
00:08:58,311 --> 00:09:00,757
My perspective is I'm
a white man in America

188
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:02,247
and I'm rich as fuck.

189
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:04,432
My perspective is broke.

190
00:09:04,432 --> 00:09:07,420
So I'm trying to rewind it
back to just be grateful.

191
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,611
I'm just grateful.

192
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:12,233
So the way I stay on the
edge and just like gratitude.

193
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:15,042
It's just gratitude, one life, one at bat.

194
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:17,918
One time, I just don't
want to see that regret

195
00:09:17,918 --> 00:09:20,348
in my eyes that I see in so many.

196
00:09:20,348 --> 00:09:22,674
And that's why it's so fun for me to come

197
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:23,699
and talk to you now

198
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:26,494
because straight up for 90% of you,

199
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:29,054
this is the greatest year
of your life, right now.

200
00:09:29,054 --> 00:09:30,661
That's just the truth.

201
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:32,609
You can be made at me,
you can be sad at me.

202
00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:33,826
You can think I'm stupid.

203
00:09:33,826 --> 00:09:35,551
I'm telling you straight
to your fuckin faces.

204
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:38,097
For 80 to 90% of you, this is it.

205
00:09:38,097 --> 00:09:39,597
This is the fuckin pinnacle, so you better

206
00:09:39,597 --> 00:09:42,175
squeeze the fuck outta this thing.

207
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:46,342
Because if you're smart and
you do then it won't be.

208
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,722
- [Man] Yeah, I couldn't agree--

209
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,963
(laughter)

210
00:09:51,963 --> 00:09:54,003
- It is 'cause it's true.

211
00:09:54,003 --> 00:09:56,548
It's not like I'm smart,
I'm just looking at data.

212
00:09:56,548 --> 00:09:57,559
- [Man] Well if you think about it.

213
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,392
- I'm just looking at history.

214
00:09:58,392 --> 00:09:59,422
I'm just talking to people.

215
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:02,083
Just being a student of life, it's true.

216
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,042
What they're doing isn't right

217
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:05,757
because they're full of shit.

218
00:10:05,757 --> 00:10:08,525
They're just not
delivering on the promise.

219
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,168
- When I talked to (mumbles),

220
00:10:10,168 --> 00:10:13,754
I was asked all the same
questions, why did you get in?

221
00:10:13,754 --> 00:10:15,098
What's your reason now?

222
00:10:15,098 --> 00:10:16,080
And that's the difference.

223
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,585
- Right, my difference was, I bought it

224
00:10:17,585 --> 00:10:18,876
'cause I'm gonna buy the Jets

225
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:21,272
and I just wanted to learn
for 30 years from now.

226
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:22,105
- Right.

227
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:23,776
- Now I'm in it to fuck it up.

228
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:26,371
I want, I'm being dead serious.

229
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:27,539
'Cause I want people to understand.

230
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:28,713
I want to tell you the truth.

231
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:31,742
I want in my Wikipedia to say and then

232
00:10:31,742 --> 00:10:35,427
in the 2017, he entered
the sports agency world

233
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,095
and he fucked that up too.

234
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,086
Yeah we gotta go.

235
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:39,375
- Let's get a pic before
you get outta here

236
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,306
so I can send it to JP.

237
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,139
- Yeah, let's do it.

238
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:43,299
- Yeah, can you get one for me?

239
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:44,511
- Appreciate it man.

240
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:45,923
- Y'all be easy, awesome pleasure.

241
00:10:45,923 --> 00:10:46,892
- Such a pleasure man.

242
00:10:46,892 --> 00:10:47,725
- Yes sir.

243
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:48,558
- I'll see ya.

244
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:49,747
- Appreciate it man, congrats

245
00:10:49,747 --> 00:10:51,001
and blessing with everything else.

246
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:52,923
- Same for you, good health.

247
00:10:52,923 --> 00:10:53,875
That was fun?

248
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:54,708
- It was great.

249
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,815
- Alright, we gotta go.

250
00:10:56,815 --> 00:10:59,065
Can't wait, coin toss baby.

251
00:11:00,838 --> 00:11:03,133
(crowd talking)

252
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:05,716
(upbeat music)

253
00:11:06,856 --> 00:11:08,812
Alright, DRock, let's
see how this one works.

254
00:11:08,812 --> 00:11:10,446
DRock said, do you have a rant in you?

255
00:11:10,446 --> 00:11:11,956
I go no, then I said yeah.

256
00:11:11,956 --> 00:11:13,750
- [DRock] I don't think
you said no, by the way.

257
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,583
- What did I say?

258
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:15,416
- [DRock] You said yeah.

259
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,249
- Oh I said yeah?

260
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:17,082
- [Camerman] You said yeah real fast.

261
00:11:17,082 --> 00:11:18,274
- I said no in my head, that's wild.

262
00:11:18,274 --> 00:11:20,210
This is a funny way to start this video.

263
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,616
Just spoke to the USC football team

264
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:24,248
and I said something in there

265
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:27,337
that really caught my attention.

266
00:11:27,337 --> 00:11:28,774
(smack hands)

267
00:11:28,774 --> 00:11:31,634
- [Gary] Alright where's this guy?

268
00:11:31,634 --> 00:11:32,467
(laughter)

269
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:33,300
How are you?

270
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,133
- I'm good man, how are you?

271
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:34,966
- What's your name?
- My name is Marquet.

272
00:11:34,966 --> 00:11:35,818
- Marquet, real pleasure man.

273
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:37,217
- Yeah, i was just watching your interview

274
00:11:37,217 --> 00:11:38,169
with The Breakfast Club man.

275
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:39,002
- Thank you my man.

276
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:39,880
- Very motivational, I appreciate that.

277
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,550
- Thank you my man.

278
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,662
- I recognize your face, I'm like whoa!

279
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:44,944
Let me say what's up to that guy.

280
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:46,090
- [Gary] (laughter) I
appreciate it, my man.

281
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:46,923
- Alright man, take care.

282
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,323
- [Gary] Have a good one.

283
00:11:48,323 --> 00:11:49,156
What's that?

284
00:11:49,156 --> 00:11:50,303
- [DRock] You want to walk home?

285
00:11:50,303 --> 00:11:51,136
- [Gary] I can't.

286
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:51,969
- I'm John Rowe.

287
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:52,802
- John, real pleasure.

288
00:11:52,802 --> 00:11:54,131
- Yeah, I coach here for a football team.

289
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,136
I played for a couple of years.

290
00:11:55,136 --> 00:11:56,531
I fucked up my shoulder but now I coach.

291
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:57,783
- Make sure DRock you wanna talk

292
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,754
to this dude to get the right--

293
00:11:59,754 --> 00:12:01,418
- So you still use Uber?

294
00:12:01,418 --> 00:12:02,950
- Yeah, it's funny, I
couldn't find my driver

295
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,011
so I had to use it like,
was the perfect spot.

296
00:12:05,011 --> 00:12:05,964
You know what's funny?

297
00:12:05,964 --> 00:12:08,084
So what do you think, I just care--

298
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:09,938
- Cam Early, he's my roommate.

299
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,104
Cam, the guy (mumbles)
talked about wine in the--

300
00:12:12,104 --> 00:12:13,040
- That dude is awesome.

301
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,950
- Yeah, he's my roommate,
he's my best friend.

302
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:15,783
- My favorite baseball player.

303
00:12:15,783 --> 00:12:16,616
- I don't want to hold you up.

304
00:12:16,616 --> 00:12:19,737
- Dude, if there's anything I could ever

305
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:21,184
be of help to anybody, let me know.

306
00:12:21,184 --> 00:12:22,017
- It's all good.

307
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:22,968
- Take care.

308
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:23,801
How are you?

309
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:24,634
- [Driver] Good, how are you?

310
00:12:24,634 --> 00:12:25,801
- [Gary] Good.

311
00:12:26,955 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
