1
00:00:00,397 --> 00:00:01,761
- You know what's so funny?

2
00:00:01,761 --> 00:00:03,994
That's probably the most, uh, I've had

3
00:00:03,994 --> 00:00:06,272
in my stomach in a long time in a rant.

4
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:08,855
(upbeat music)

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,180
- [Woman] He's like forward thinking.

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,939
He's not scared to speak his mind.

7
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,097
- And it's practical.

8
00:00:22,097 --> 00:00:22,952
- [Woman] It's totally practical.

9
00:00:22,952 --> 00:00:25,243
- That's the thing that,
like, that's the part

10
00:00:25,243 --> 00:00:27,773
I will never win because
of my gift of gab.

11
00:00:27,773 --> 00:00:31,375
It hides the level of
practicality that I'm speaking to.

12
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,521
This is real now.

13
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:34,732
- [Woman] It's completely real now.

14
00:00:34,732 --> 00:00:36,913
I think that you're
basically, this is what

15
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:39,701
you had to say, and I hope that--

16
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:40,534
- I want--

17
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:41,684
- [Woman] I hope the P&G'ers--

18
00:00:41,684 --> 00:00:44,720
- It's a selfless execution.

19
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,553
- [Woman] Absolutely.

20
00:00:45,553 --> 00:00:46,820
- Because my ambition is to buy brands

21
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,125
that companies like this ruin,

22
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,154
buy them on a nickel on the
dollar, and resurrect them.

23
00:00:52,154 --> 00:00:54,166
So, I just can't buy them all,

24
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,969
so might as well do good along the way.

25
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,438
- [Man] I'm running a small startup.

26
00:00:58,438 --> 00:00:59,271
It's like--

27
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:00,104
- It's a totally different point, right?

28
00:01:00,104 --> 00:01:02,290
- [Man] It's like your
head, you're going all this,

29
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,584
it's like you don't tolerate things

30
00:01:04,584 --> 00:01:05,863
that you would've at bigger companies.

31
00:01:05,863 --> 00:01:07,420
- 100%, you can't afford to.

32
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,253
- [Man] Yeah.

33
00:01:08,253 --> 00:01:09,198
- Yeah, thanks for saying hello, yeah.

34
00:01:09,198 --> 00:01:10,031
- [Man] Thank you, yeah.

35
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:11,333
- The vlog, it's gonna be a short episode

36
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,701
mainly cause D-Rock overslept,

37
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:14,750
and because we took a connecting red-eye

38
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,888
from LA, to Chicago, to here in Cincinnati

39
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:19,385
where I just gave a key note.

40
00:01:19,385 --> 00:01:21,061
To be very frank, maybe
it's because my good friend

41
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:23,612
Craig, let's show Craig,
maybe because of his words,

42
00:01:23,612 --> 00:01:26,377
and he's always very straight but kind,

43
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,968
or maybe just, you know,
you have these talks.

44
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:29,196
They're moments in time.

45
00:01:29,196 --> 00:01:30,990
Something really great
just happened on stage.

46
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,945
I would say that what it was was it's

47
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:36,611
a moment that I would say synthesizes,

48
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:40,807
confirms, reinforces, puts
the bow on this thesis

49
00:01:40,807 --> 00:01:42,924
that I'm living on an every day basis,

50
00:01:42,924 --> 00:01:44,286
and i just fucking know I'm right.

51
00:01:44,286 --> 00:01:45,358
I don't know what else to say.

52
00:01:45,358 --> 00:01:47,075
I just know I'm right,
and I know that every day

53
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:51,048
that passes, more good is
gonna be happening for me.

54
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:53,827
The amount of money that
I'm leaving on the table

55
00:01:53,827 --> 00:01:56,784
the last seven years, for
the historical brand equity

56
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,641
of being correct, is enormous.

57
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:00,820
This is a subtlety that I
don't talk to you about,

58
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,927
don't talk about in general.

59
00:02:02,927 --> 00:02:05,305
It's because I'm not cashing
in on all the opportunities

60
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:09,122
because I'm trying to spend
time on doing a talk like this

61
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:10,592
that just took up my whole day

62
00:02:10,592 --> 00:02:12,352
because the inefficiencies
of LA, Cincinnati,

63
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,939
and New York, but the impact is greater

64
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:17,371
in the word of mouth of
this collective audience

65
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,996
over a four to five year macro.

66
00:02:19,996 --> 00:02:22,155
So many people, so many
of you are scrutinizing

67
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:24,797
how to maximize more views, more likes,

68
00:02:24,797 --> 00:02:27,378
more engagement, more ad
sense pre-roll in your thing,

69
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:30,494
more sales, more t-shirt
sales, more speaking fees,

70
00:02:30,494 --> 00:02:32,244
short term financial.

71
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,764
Please, please pay
attention to what I'm doing

72
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:39,257
which is make the financial
you need to survive,

73
00:02:39,257 --> 00:02:41,272
to live, and maybe to get
that one or two things

74
00:02:41,272 --> 00:02:43,990
you need a year to get
your nuts off and be happy,

75
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,371
a trip here, a trip there,
but then take all those

76
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:48,257
other dollar opportunities, or dollars,

77
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:50,874
and reinvest them into where you're going.

78
00:02:50,874 --> 00:02:53,723
I reinvest them in content creation,

79
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:56,886
in distribution of my thoughts,
in pontificating my truths,

80
00:02:56,886 --> 00:03:00,043
and giving away my best value to you

81
00:03:00,043 --> 00:03:02,126
and anybody who's willing to consume it

82
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:04,424
with the hopes and
thoughts that the karma,

83
00:03:04,424 --> 00:03:07,189
and the realities of those
truths in a 10 year window,

84
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:09,894
create the opportunities
for me to trade on

85
00:03:09,894 --> 00:03:11,127
in the future.

86
00:03:11,127 --> 00:03:13,756
Please, please, please pay
attention to what I'm doing

87
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:16,306
I'm super empathetic.

88
00:03:16,306 --> 00:03:17,779
I only deploy empathy.

89
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:20,030
It doesn't make it right, though.

90
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,724
And, there's something clearly happening.

91
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:23,057
It's macro data.

92
00:03:23,907 --> 00:03:25,314
The brands are losing.

93
00:03:25,314 --> 00:03:26,147
- [Woman In Gray] Yeah, they're losing.

94
00:03:26,147 --> 00:03:26,980
- It's real.

95
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,230
97%, this is not you, all of them.

96
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:32,359
- [Woman In Gray] No, it's
all brands are losing.

97
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:35,740
- All of them, 97% Fortune
500 CPG brands declined.

98
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,254
That's absurd.

99
00:03:37,254 --> 00:03:38,155
- [Woman In Gray] It is absurd.

100
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:40,726
- It's the over investment
in TVC and programmatic

101
00:03:40,726 --> 00:03:42,647
digital banners.

102
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:43,736
That's really what it is.

103
00:03:43,736 --> 00:03:44,969
There's a lot going on.

104
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:46,482
- Yeah, we've been talking
about it the whole conference.

105
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:49,415
- Online dating, Uber,
Airbnb, this is real stuff.

106
00:03:49,415 --> 00:03:50,669
- [Woman In Gray] It's real, I know.

107
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:51,502
- Like, it's real.

108
00:03:51,502 --> 00:03:52,335
It's not coming, it's here.

109
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:54,367
- [Woman In Gray] No, and
Gen Z and millennials,

110
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,200
if you look at actually
what they grew up with--

111
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,623
- What about you?

112
00:03:57,623 --> 00:03:58,505
- [Woman In Gray] Yeah, what about me?

113
00:03:58,505 --> 00:03:59,506
We even use Uber.

114
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,858
We Ubered last night.

115
00:04:00,858 --> 00:04:01,691
- Thank you.

116
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:04,314
How easy is it to get to
you on page 147 of Vogue.

117
00:04:04,314 --> 00:04:06,924
How easy is it to get to
you to a banner pop-up ad.

118
00:04:06,924 --> 00:04:07,907
How easy is it?

119
00:04:07,907 --> 00:04:08,740
It's not.

120
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,429
It's not where your attention is.

121
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:14,461
Not your actual attention,
not potential attention.

122
00:04:14,461 --> 00:04:15,443
It's just real.

123
00:04:15,443 --> 00:04:16,865
- [Man] I mean, you see companies like,

124
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:19,610
I mean the one invested
the catalog with Sears,

125
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,570
and where is Sears today?

126
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,675
- That's right my friend.

127
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:23,257
- [Man] So, you start looking at history.

128
00:04:23,257 --> 00:04:24,512
If you don't change--

129
00:04:24,512 --> 00:04:25,772
- You will die.

130
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:27,242
- [Man] Congratulations.

131
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:28,075
- Thank you.

132
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:28,908
- [Man] Thank you so having us.

133
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:29,741
- Thank you for listening.

134
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:30,574
Hey, guys.

135
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:32,002
I'm gonna try and do this more often

136
00:04:32,002 --> 00:04:33,985
when I'm lucky enough if D-Rock's with me.

137
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:37,772
Just tried something new
where I posted A, B, C, or D

138
00:04:37,772 --> 00:04:40,872
on Twitter where I'm gonna get feedback.

139
00:04:40,872 --> 00:04:42,086
I have four videos I'm sitting on.

140
00:04:42,086 --> 00:04:43,933
Instead of me kind of
arbitrarily looking at

141
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:46,984
what the team's chopping up
through our conversations,

142
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:48,464
I'm gonna start using Twitter a little bit

143
00:04:48,464 --> 00:04:50,915
in a kind of like 1, 2,
3, or 4, A, B, C, or D,

144
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,561
post the videos up, see
what the feedback is,

145
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:56,750
and then go and distribute
it in the other channels.

146
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,210
Sometimes we, I'm trading
on the arbitrary nature

147
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,750
of what I'm feeling,
which often does well,

148
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,612
but there's so many opportunities
to do creative things

149
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:08,579
so it's a new creative pillar for Twitter.

150
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:09,728
Make sure you follow me there.

151
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:11,305
Here's the new reason why.

152
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:13,653
You get to see almost everything.

153
00:05:13,653 --> 00:05:17,057
That allows me to use it
as a siphoning mechanism

154
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:20,603
to what I then put on some
of the other platforms.

155
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:23,499
You know, try what I'm
doing, do what I'm doing

156
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:24,733
not what I'm saying.

157
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:26,774
Here's me in real time,
innovating, trying something new,

158
00:05:26,774 --> 00:05:30,024
four videos in a row, bang, bang, bang,

159
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:33,440
still trying to even post,

160
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,379
and then looking up the feedback.

161
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:36,691
Let's see what happens.

162
00:05:36,691 --> 00:05:37,795
Cool.

163
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,553
Instagram's a really interesting platform.

164
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:42,288
You should go look at my
trainer, Jordan Syatt.

165
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:43,657
He's so knowledgeable.

166
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:45,102
I was like, bro, you're
sitting on knowledge.

167
00:05:45,102 --> 00:05:46,249
Put it out.

168
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:49,317
So, then he started making
content that was just valuable,

169
00:05:49,317 --> 00:05:51,880
like breaking down things
and teaching people.

170
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,397
Then miraculously, he
went from 4,000 to 250,000

171
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,257
followers in nine months.

172
00:05:56,257 --> 00:05:57,090
Why?

173
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,228
Because he listened to the other things

174
00:05:58,228 --> 00:06:00,920
that I told him which is
Instagram's about hashtags

175
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,993
if nobody's following you.

176
00:06:01,993 --> 00:06:03,187
Do not post anything on Instagram

177
00:06:03,187 --> 00:06:06,675
without your first comment
being 15, 20 hashtags

178
00:06:06,675 --> 00:06:10,424
because hashtag is the
currency inside Instagram.

179
00:06:10,424 --> 00:06:12,274
He got disciplined, put out content

180
00:06:12,274 --> 00:06:14,008
that was valuable to people, and then also

181
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:15,724
put 30 hashtags.

182
00:06:15,724 --> 00:06:17,802
Then, slowly but surely,
people started discovering him,

183
00:06:17,802 --> 00:06:19,640
and he had something of value to them.

184
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,157
This is value exchange.

185
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:23,740
The reason I've won for the last 20 years,

186
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,487
and for the rest of my life in business,

187
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:27,351
I'm trying to give the best value,

188
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:29,785
and that is leverage for
me to get what I want.

189
00:06:29,785 --> 00:06:31,045
51-49.

190
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:32,669
I'm gonna give you more than I ask,

191
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:34,621
and that's why I get plenty.

192
00:06:34,621 --> 00:06:36,632
Thank you, Craig.

193
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:38,771
I don't know if you've heard about the,

194
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:39,606
I got it, I got it.

195
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:40,439
Here you go, man.

196
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,272
Thank you.

197
00:06:41,272 --> 00:06:42,105
- Oh, thank you, I appreciate it.

198
00:06:42,105 --> 00:06:43,143
- I don't know if you've
heard about the hottest

199
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:45,105
super hero in the game.

200
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,472
- The hottest super hero?

201
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,490
- Yeah, the hottest
super hero in the game.

202
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,323
Do you know who it is?

203
00:06:49,323 --> 00:06:50,203
- [Craig] Who's that?

204
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:53,203
- That is this incredible super hero

205
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,914
called Airport Gary.

206
00:06:56,843 --> 00:07:00,901
You're gonna watch as he
transforms into it right now.

207
00:07:00,901 --> 00:07:01,734
Yes.

208
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,507
I go from normal business man

209
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:10,007
to entrepreneurial super hero.

210
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:12,829
Airport Gary.

211
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:14,552
D-Rock, this is your
favorite part of every vlog.

212
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:15,697
- [D-Rock] Yeah.

213
00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:16,798
- I have music now.

214
00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:18,099
- This is another day in the life.

215
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:19,838
(laughs)

216
00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:20,694
- Oh, you're--

217
00:07:20,694 --> 00:07:21,800
- We're on Delta.

218
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,033
- You guys are on Delta?

219
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:23,866
- Yeah.

220
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:24,699
- And, I'm on what?

221
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:25,532
- [Man] United.

222
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:26,803
- Okay, well, I'm wrapping up here.

223
00:07:26,803 --> 00:07:27,636
Thank you.

224
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:29,722
How are you.

225
00:07:29,722 --> 00:07:30,555
- Very well.

226
00:07:30,555 --> 00:07:31,388
I enjoyed it.

227
00:07:31,388 --> 00:07:32,221
- [Gary] Thank you so much.

228
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:33,514
- Thoughts for the ride home.

229
00:07:33,514 --> 00:07:34,454
- [Craig] I'll make sure they hold that.

230
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,319
- [Gary] It's very real.

231
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,253
- If brands can make it's products

232
00:07:36,253 --> 00:07:37,548
and struggle, but manage
to make it, I guess.

233
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:38,381
I don't know.

234
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:41,919
You've just got to start
living old school today.

235
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,996
- [Gary] It's systematic in the way

236
00:07:44,996 --> 00:07:47,035
that we're rewarding
people and their behavior.

237
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:48,322
- No, I get that.

238
00:07:48,322 --> 00:07:49,155
- [Gary] It's just very big.

239
00:07:49,155 --> 00:07:51,738
(upbeat music)

240
00:07:59,107 --> 00:00:00,000
- Way better than Batman.
