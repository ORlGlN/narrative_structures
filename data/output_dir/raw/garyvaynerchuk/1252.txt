Daniel asks numbers of monthly active

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:05,160
users aside do you think Instagram is

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,960
actually a larger social network than

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,490
Twitter Daniel I think that a its rim

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,580
and Twitter are tremendously different I

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,920
think Twitter is kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> town hall</font>

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,710
the cocktail party of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our society when</font>

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,199
things happen in the world you know

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,310
that's where we're going you know

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,949
unfortunate hostage situation in Sydney

11
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,320
I'm not running to insta to see the

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,910
pictures I'm running to Twitter for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">conversation on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the flip side I do not</font>

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,360
believe there's a social network in the

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,070
world that exists right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now that has</font>

16
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,079
more of the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> attention of the</font>

17
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">consumer that Instagram meaning we're</font>

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,070
looking at those pictures pretty

19
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,440
carefully in this world by comparison

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,140
you know it's you know this episode's

21
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,430
going to tie nice together<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

22
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,200
nicely because I know the other

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,350
questions and I know my push for insta I

24
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,629
think it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> attention on the gram</font>

25
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,520
and I think that's where it's really

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,960
winning I think people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are really</font>

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,149
consuming content and paying attention

28
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,710
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons that Twitter is</font>

29
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,359
evolving is you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to be able</font>

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,729
to send a tweet six<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago and even</font>

31
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:07,260
though with<font color="#E5E5E5"> substantially less of an</font>

32
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,210
audience of reach I had more action

33
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,950
because the attention was more serious

34
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,600
now the fire hose has gotten so intense

35
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,750
so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the variables you know from</font>

36
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> net net game of attention I think it's</font>

37
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,280
pretty close<font color="#E5E5E5"> but Instagram is clearly</font>

38
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,259
going in the right direction they just

39
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,210
put that differently that's all oh crap

40
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,470
wait subscribe do I need subscriptions

41
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,170
because I can't push this many right

42
00:01:31,170 --> 00:00:00,000
hooks in social so subscribe
