00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,760
how to be confident when you're a bigger

221
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,130
girl confidence I don't care if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

bigger girl or a hot chick ugly chick or

225
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,520
anything confidence is when you believe

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,430
in yourself and you just kind of have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

like graphs grasp that I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even talk</font>

228
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,880
it's so hard for someone to say like how

229
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,590
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be confident because it really is</font>

230
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,840
when you find your inner self that you

231
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,200
can be confident um like for me I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

233
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,820
person that I am confident as well like

235
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">wear I would always you know I don't</font>

236
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">even know how to describe this but</font>

237
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,770
certain things can make you feel better

238
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,270
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself about yourself like for</font>

ignore other people say to an extinct

263
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,649
ignore hurtful things and believe in
