00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
hey guys today we're on a gangsta lean

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,640
because I'm so comfy right now I was

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,049
just watching YouTube videos and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I</font>

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">was like text message I've still got to</font>

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,620
fill my would you rather um video that I

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,690
asked you guys questions on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook and</font>

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">I didn't get mini but i don't know maybe</font>

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,730
it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a small me a short</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video or</font>

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,439
something so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is and</font>

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,970
i'm reading off the screen would you

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,039
rather shave your head or never wear

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,980
makeup again ever in your whole life

13
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,300
definitely shave my head because then at

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,829
least I could just shave my head for

15
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,410
cancer or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> raised some money</font>

16
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could just wear wigs like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd</font>

17
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,010
hate to get rid of my hair because I

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,200
really like my long hair like my hair

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,059
long I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like short hair and I would</font>

20
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,039
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> ridiculous bald but I just wear</font>

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,620
wigs every day and I feel good<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

22
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">makeup is like a big part of my life</font>

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,649
like I don't know makeups fun and I

24
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,379
prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> make up to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here if you know what</font>

25
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,109
I mean would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rather do Lady Gaga or</font>

26
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:03,449
Katy Perry's<font color="#E5E5E5"> makeup Katy Perry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

27
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,519
hundred percent I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> katie period is</font>

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,189
like a total babe and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not a big fan</font>

29
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:09,840
of Lady Gaga I think she's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weird</font>

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,450
um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Katy Perry is just absolutely</font>

31
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,400
stunning and amazing so Katy Perry would

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,560
you rather be<font color="#E5E5E5"> deaf or blind this is</font>

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,689
really really hard for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

34
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:24,000
don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I can't imagine having</font>

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,900
either maybe diff like I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> think both</font>

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,860
of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> would just be so terrible um</font>

37
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:40,259
sorry um yeah probably diff would you

38
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,909
rather go out to the movies or stay at

39
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,310
home watching DVDs I'd rather go out and

40
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,689
watch movies just<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz I like the</font>

41
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,220
atmosphere especially if you're like in

42
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,479
a funny movie like everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else laughs</font>

43
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,100
and it just makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more funny than a</font>

44
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,610
new banners um even though like<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

45
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,020
out for movies are so expensive it's

46
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,670
such a ripoff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know I just</font>

47
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,119
like the atmosphere would you rather fit

48
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,310
with foundation or would you rather wear

49
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,680
eyeshadow foundation I never used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,068
wear eyeshadow um I like having my skin

51
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:12,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">and even tired I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't like my rudeness</font>

52
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,320
and

53
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,400
stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes me look so much more</font>

54
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,290
fresh faced in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wake so yeah um next or</font>

55
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">mac and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I probably have to say Mac just</font>

56
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I love mac eyeshadows and mac</font>

57
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,340
lipsticks and stuff like next<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love</font>

58
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,110
their lipsticks and blushes but make I

59
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,690
love their next bit lipstick splashes

60
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,560
and other stuff so I think Mac would

61
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,050
just win yeah would you rather marry

62
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,940
someone who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> good looking in vain or</font>

63
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,380
someone with poor self-image probably

64
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,300
someone that was vain because I hate it

65
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">when people go on about themselves like</font>

66
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">I am so ugly like if you compliment</font>

67
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,060
someone and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just come back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at you</font>

68
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,840
like no I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not I'm not pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or I'm</font>

69
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,250
ugly and I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're</font>

70
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,750
nicely I used to be like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ages ago</font>

71
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,610
exciting no confidence whatsoever and

72
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,310
now I realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> how annoying there was so</font>

73
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,210
yeah like Richie he ain't vain but he

74
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,980
doesn't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he's ugly or anything</font>

75
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,750
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yeah Emily um would you</font>

76
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,520
rather live in a place where it was

77
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,370
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> super hot 365 days a year would</font>

78
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,780
you rather loan place where was always

79
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,480
really cold hot I just want my lip

80
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,440
because I hate the cold light I don't

81
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,810
know just hate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but they may hate it</font>

82
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,280
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hot in your lying in</font>

83
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,080
bed<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can't sleep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the life of</font>

84
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,730
you because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just too hot I hate</font>

85
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,770
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> too gangsta lean um yeah I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

86
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">know I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd still say hot just cuz</font>

87
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,730
I love hot sunny days and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's so pretty</font>

88
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,260
outside and I don't know it's just nicer

89
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,240
ok this is the last persons questions

90
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,400
and she asked lots<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok would you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rather</font>

91
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,230
love someone who hates you or hate

92
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,120
someone who loves you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe love</font>

93
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,440
someone who hates you because at least

94
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,660
then you could keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a secret and then</font>

95
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,880
that never know so they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have cared</font>

96
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,550
I don't know and would you rather read

97
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,840
the whole dictionary or eat your

98
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">favorite food into your sink that</font>

99
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,200
therefore never be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> eat again</font>

100
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,370
definitely the second one I'd rather eat

101
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">my food my favorite food until I was</font>

102
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:22,750
sick of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because my favorite foods are</font>

103
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,870
all really creepy for me so like say if

104
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,080
my favorite food was pizza

105
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,699
I think my favorite foods like pizza and

106
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:30,349
pasta and like Italian food and stuff

107
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:32,900
like that and Mexican food like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

108
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,370
rather just stuff my face full of that

109
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,509
so I never wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> eat it again</font>

110
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:40,310
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> my body wouldn't mind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um would</font>

111
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,539
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> rather watch a documentary about</font>

112
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:43,370
cells for 18 hours straight endless and

113
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,110
take notes and not do anything else or

114
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,759
not go on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the computer for an entire</font>

115
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,919
month probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first one cuz my</font>

116
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,569
entire life<font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

117
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:55,430
computer right now like<font color="#CCCCCC"> my entire course</font>

118
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,520
is like basically completely computer

119
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,759
orientated my<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube's on the computer</font>

120
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,229
it's how I stay in touch with friends

121
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:05,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I don't see often so I'd rather</font>

122
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">bore myself to death 18 hours straight</font>

123
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,629
um would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you rather be absolutely</font>

124
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:14,180
freezing naked and tactica or<font color="#E5E5E5"> wear a</font>

125
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,889
snowsuit and<font color="#CCCCCC"> butyl private of water and</font>

126
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:18,710
the Sahara Desert I haven't no idea

127
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,940
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think I'd probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> die either</font>

128
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,940
way like how<font color="#E5E5E5"> could anyone survive it I</font>

129
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:28,069
think I'd have to say the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

130
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:30,529
freezing naked in Antarctica because I

131
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:31,879
get heatstroke really really easily

132
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,069
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good if I said I'd rather</font>

133
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:35,810
live in some with it was really hot all

134
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,029
year long but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm yeah like I get</font>

135
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:39,800
heatstroke just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> BAM and I would</font>

136
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">just feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm gonna faint and I</font>

137
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,509
feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need a woman and I get like</font>

138
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:47,089
real dry and yet it's horrible so I

139
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:48,650
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just imagine like completely</font>

140
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,330
passing out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and dying in the Sahara</font>

141
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,669
Desert would you rather kill a

142
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:54,770
defenseless animal or a mediocre not

143
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,550
very good person this is really sad

144
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,319
because I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather color person</font>

145
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,150
no but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really i wouldn't do a color</font>

146
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,979
person like<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it well I couldn't even</font>

147
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:05,810
ever do that I don't know how it is

148
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,759
possible for these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like Steve</font>

149
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,500
someone or shoot someone I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

150
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,819
