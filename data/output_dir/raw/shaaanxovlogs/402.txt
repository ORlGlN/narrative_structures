67
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,910
knee problems when I was a bit younger

68
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,070
like I remember going on like a hiking

69
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,780
trip and my need dislocated and it was

70
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,010
real sore and I never really got<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

71
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,370
fixed I think just the like pressure on

72
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,410
my knees and<font color="#CCCCCC"> my joints was really sore</font>

73
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,770
but I ran life out better today so into

74
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,480
the gym and I ran<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 10 minutes</font>

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,080
straight quite quickly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then man how</font>

76
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,670
much realized that the actual distance

77
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,709
sitting wasn't even stood up properly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

78
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:05,420
there was a fail but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go</font>

83
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,320
my needs of strengthened up a bit at all

84
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,870
because usually I stick to bike rowing

85
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,239
and cross trainer so it's not like

86
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,800
outdoor running where you really have

87
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,989
like up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like lots of strain</font>

88
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:26,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">on your knees and everything and but if</font>

challenge on the treadmill because it's

91
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:30,530
better doing it on the trip more than

92
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,840
not at all i really want to accomplish

93
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,840

94
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,310
idea how far<font color="#CCCCCC"> I went in 18 minutes</font>

95
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,140
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would have at least cost</font>

96
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,690
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> halfway</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I didn't do any of the</font>

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,919
can't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> how long it took me i</font>

154
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:50,449

but I ran it three kilometers no

158
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:58,010
stopping but I didn't do the burpees so

159
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,650
I didn't completely successfully do the

160
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,449
challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I am still really happy</font>

161
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:04,639
with how I went and it's something that

162
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">I can work towards in the future I'm</font>

163
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,419
really really proud of myself like so

164
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:10,310

184
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,620
on the treadmill at the gym so basically

185
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,570

186
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,370

188
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,700

189
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,860
be you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep on running and</font>

190
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,600
hopefully one day I can run<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 kilometers</font>

191
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,120
outside without stopping my<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest</font>

192
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,400
issue with running outside as I run

193
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,110
really really fast at first i tire

194
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,660
myself out really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really quickly so I</font>

195
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn to breathe and to</font>

196
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,770
pace myself while I'm running outside so

197
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,240
we don't use up all my energy really

198
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,760
really really quickly on the treadmill

199
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,380
at the gym I can kind of just go<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

200
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,660
steady speed and I can therefore last a

201
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,450
lot longer so it's easier for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and so</font>

202
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,710
yeah that's my goal I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font>

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">running on the treadmill at the gym and</font>
