<font color="#E5E5E5">know I just really like the food here</font>

154
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,740
it's delicious it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of expensive</font>

155
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,270
but it's malicious there we have

156
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,160
socialized vegetables and fruit and all

157
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,810
sorts of stuff the other thing i love

158
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">about is alone I love in I hate so this</font>

159
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,880
can count as one for both two degrees of

160
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">separation here in New Zealand you know</font>

161
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,200
one person who<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows another person</font>

162
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,330
every time every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single time like</font>

163
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,420
somehow if you randomly run into someone

164
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,310
and Oakland and I'm from Christchurch

165
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,600
that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not from Christchurch but</font>

166
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,290
understand and there is like such a high

167
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,910
chance that somehow you know someone

168
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,050
that they know or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

169
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,670
ladies just two degrees<font color="#CCCCCC"> of separation</font>

170
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,400
everywhere it's insane everyone knows

171
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,020
everyone you kind of keep secrets<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

172
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,090
towns like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so it's like this</font>

173
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">country's like this so a couple more</font>

174
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">things I don't like about New Zealand</font>

175
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,500
everything's freaking expensive like

176
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,080
makeup

177
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,870
is it insane like heaps of things are

178
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,460
just insanely priced just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

179
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,169
know we're so far away from everyone

180
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:47,610
else like yeah there's the exchange rate

181
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,259
but then on top of that is free to call

182
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,060
this net in this net there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as many</font>

183
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,680
opportunities here is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in a lot</font>

184
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">of other countries like I mean these</font>

185
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,550
limited jobs and things like that in

186
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,319
certain fields because obviously we're

187
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,990
very eager cultural inclined and most of

188
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,699
the jobs aren't like bigger cities like

189
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,919
Oakland Christchurch<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wellington things</font>

190
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,659
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> like my city there's not far</font>

191
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,819
you can go I suppose it's something

192
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,710
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that great I mean that's why</font>

193
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,389
so many New Zealanders move over to like

194
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:14,159
Australia because there's so many more

195
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:15,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">jobs and opportunities over there such</font>

196
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,789
like it's obviously a huger country so

197
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:19,979
my favorite animals or pizza ever had

198
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,560
when I was little I had a rabbit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font>

199
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,139
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> first birthday party and the magician</font>

200
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,120
pulled a rabbit out of his magicians hat

201
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,219
and I got to keep it it was amazing I

202
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:31,080
had roosters once they were freaking

203
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,400
cool part from one time they chased me

204
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,349
