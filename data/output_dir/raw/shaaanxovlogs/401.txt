I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them today so I got</font>

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,890
in both hit okay so Sam law asked hey

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,170
Sam yes would you rather be<font color="#E5E5E5"> blind or</font>

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,990
paralyzed from the neck down who neither

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,320
I think I would rather be it's so hard

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,570
because either you can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything you</font>

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,189
can't see anything um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd rather</font>

13
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,600
be paralyzed because like my being in

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,910
life is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just being able to see pretty</font>

15
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and enjoy things that I can see</font>

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,090
oh that's so hard I don't know I feel

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,410
like I should rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> be blind because</font>

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,149
then at least I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> walk around and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

19
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,800
things but what's the point<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you</font>

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,260
can't see I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> barbecue sauce or</font>

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,420
tomato sauce<font color="#E5E5E5"> barbecue i freakin love</font>

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,579
barbecue sauce although i do like tomato

23
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,890
sauce some tomato sauce on a pie it's

24
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,960
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't had a pie in so</font>

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,520
long would you rather go without makeup

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,049
free year ago with that care products

27
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,760
for you differently care products

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,119
because I don't ah sorry definitely care

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,159
products because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

30
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">many hair products in my hair anyway at</font>

31
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,520
least eight counts shampoo and

32
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,140
conditioner because in that case I would

33
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,970
rather go without makeup for you but if

34
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,890
it's just like here products like

35
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,450
styling products then definitely i'd

36
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,920
rather go without hair styling products

37
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,860
oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good would you rather change</font>

38
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,500
genders every time you sneeze or not be

39
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,090
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell the difference between your</font>

40
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,070
muffin I would rather change in does

41
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,390
every time I sneeze because that would

42
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">be hilarious and I've always wanted to</font>

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,869
see what it's like to be a boy plus if I

44
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,490
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a baby I wouldn't want to</font>

45
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,640
misplace my baby in the pantry<font color="#CCCCCC"> and grab</font>

46
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,040
muffins and try to breastfeed muffins

47
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,200
that's awkward would you rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

48
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,700
sexually attracted to fruit or

49
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,189
permanently head twistys stuck two

50
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:52,110
fingers like the dust stuck two fingers

51
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,869
if it's permanently stuck to my fingers

52
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:56,340
does that mean you can constantly look

53
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,780
it off and always be there because that

54
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,070
I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably get really over late</font>

55
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,159
because I love twistys I think I'd

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,930
rather be sexually attracted to fruit

57
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,549
because then at least I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay away</font>

58
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,770
from fruit at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least someone like looked</font>

59
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,598
at a banana in my house<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be a</font>

60
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,580
bit tragic would you rather destroy your

61
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,280
makeup collection

62
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,200
clothing collection clothing collection

63
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,390
because I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have expensive</font>

64
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,819
clothing or anything like that when I'm

65
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:20,500
talking about my clothes I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

66
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,140
wear like like twenty percent of my

67
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,330
wardrobe I'm constantly going through

68
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,280
and like grabbing stuff for charity or

69
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,440
grabbing stuff her friends so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

70
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,140
rather have my fashion collection

71
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,270
destroyed no violations or no eyebrows

72
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,930
I'd rather have no eyebrows because I'm

73
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably better drawing on eyebrows then</font>

74
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,050
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stick on false eyelashes when</font>

75
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,700
there's no eyelashes there to hold<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font>

100
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:34,600

00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,010
you'll be invisible and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like spy on</font>

102
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,540
people and listen to conversations but

103
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,120
some things are better this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

104
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,950
random but I think some things are

105
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,200
better like when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't know about</font>

106
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,910
them if you what I mean so it would just

107
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">get you into really bad situations but</font>

108
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,530
if you can fly like hollow convenience

109
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,329
and how cool is that would you rather

110
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:54,609
live in a mansion with no makeup or live

111
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,260
