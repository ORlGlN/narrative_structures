00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,250
it's gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like but it's not really</font>

78
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,739
bit that's just what runs through my

79
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,780
mind apparently and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't know it's</font>

82
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:44,819
insecurities like I'm pretty fine um

like they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like I don't get our</font>

88
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:01,859
