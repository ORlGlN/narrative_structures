3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,950
child in you tag and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i haven't really</font>

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,389
read through the questions I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

5
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:11,429
just briefly remember them from watching

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">her video but I'm just going to jump</font>

7
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:14,400
straight into it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really</font>

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,320
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear this video too much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,090
the first question as a kid what was

10
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,060
your dream job my dream job for ages was

11
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,369
to be a marine biologist because I was

12
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,859
obsessed with dolphins whales sea

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,109
creatures in general and they asked that

14
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,849
I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really wanted to be a bit but</font>

15
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,549
then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> discovered well I got told that</font>

16
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,530
if i was a bit i would<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably have to</font>

17
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,440
deal with putting down a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of animals</font>

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,620
and giving them operations and<font color="#CCCCCC"> lots of</font>

19
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">girls</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and i couldn't deal with</font>

20
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,450
that because i love animals and I

21
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,350
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to see them hurt so yeah</font>

22
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,629
um how old were you when you found out

23
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:53,190
that santa wasn't real with how did you

24
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,190
find out well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was a pretty smart kid</font>

25
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,930
let me tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I was probably I</font>

26
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,579
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite young when I found out but I</font>

27
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,260
never told my mom because I knew that if

28
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,060
I told my mom usually wouldn't mind me

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,310
um present from Santa anymore that's

30
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,689
what I thought because<font color="#E5E5E5"> she still buys me</font>

31
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:12,960
presents from Santa but when I was

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,280
younger you know I was an animal

33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,409
phonetic did any of you used to collect

34
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,810
those animals animals animals like you

35
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,640
know those little magazine things that

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,630
you could collect and put in a big

37
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,280
binder I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to click them I'd like</font>

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,360
every single one for<font color="#E5E5E5"> like two years</font>

39
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,119
anyway I knew that reindeers couldn't

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,700
fly you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just knew was impossible</font>

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,659
um so I figured out Santa can be real if

42
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,579
he rides around on flying reindeers you

43
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,439
know that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of crap I</font>

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,119
probably figured that out when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was six</font>

45
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,240
or seven I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> told anyone what was</font>

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,700
your favorite Halloween costume is a kid

47
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,540
and use it when we don't really

48
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,460
celebrate Halloween that much my parents

49
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,079
never let me go I've never been they

50
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">never let me go to go feeling because I</font>

51
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:51,720
was too scared that I would knock on

52
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,399
some old<font color="#CCCCCC"> men's door and it kept me or</font>

53
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:54,990
knock on someone's door in that poison

54
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,890
the lollies or something out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

55
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they're psychos everywhere I</font>

56
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,219
don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like just because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't</font>

57
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,829
really celebrate it not really like they

58
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:02,820

59
