really hard to explain but like you have

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,360
to think to yourself if you're making

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,950
videos and someone sees something nasty

19
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,989
they're not the one making videos

20
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:50,309
they're not the ones putting themselves

21
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,070
out there they could be a five-year-old

22
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,620
