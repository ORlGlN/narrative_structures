151
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,910

152
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,790
30 minutes it looks like four times a

153
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,330
week and I will<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do it on quite a</font>

154
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,780
hard resistance or I'll do like really

155
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,430
low resistance and then really high

156
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,260
resistance<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'll do like three minutes</font>

157
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,520
slower through minutes hearth room it's

158
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,780
low three minutes hi and that burns all

159
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,220
the calories and gets a lot of muscle

160
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,140
going as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well but yeah generally I like</font>

161
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,270
to keep on a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a harder resistance</font>

162
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,710
