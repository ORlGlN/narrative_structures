00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,340
which I need to kill because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's ruin</font>

49
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,310
all the fun subscribe award and the

50
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,690
screen of greenness I could put my hand

51
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,130
anywhere in the world with this

52
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,530
technology so that's what I did right as

53
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,440
you can see look I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to those little</font>

54
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">twisty in things that you know locked</font>

55
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,970
into a wall this here basically is

56
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,340
doubling over so I can lift this up and

57
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,290
I can put this down I can put a second

58
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,750
life in between the screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I want to</font>

59
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,410
that way if I really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I can light</font>

60
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,959
up green screen because sometimes you

61
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,790
actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put a life behind the</font>

62
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,850
green screen to get like extra beaming

63
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,200
light and you can have backward like I'm

64
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,610
for that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> call lighting up the green</font>

65
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:51,200

66
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,709
the external hood and this and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

67
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:57,920

68
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,860
daylight if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use it but think</font>

69
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the green screens it's funny</font>

70
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,390

00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,670
light the last daylight you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

72
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,470

00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,149
minimize in daylight and maximize on the

77
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,640
controllable light like this guy here

78
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,738

I'm risking I'm risking my life on the

142
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">basis that she ain't gonna be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> until six</font>
