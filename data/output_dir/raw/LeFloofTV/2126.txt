53
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:39,360
on earth oh you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of crazy</font>

54
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,440
me and think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I don't know</font>

55
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,450
saying that she saw this picture a while

56
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,120
ago and it was like a kiss at with a

57
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,850
pencil and it was like you know the

58
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,830
future generations will not understand

59
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,480
how these two things went together and

60
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,920
it's like yeah like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> would that make</font>

61
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense to anybody you know like like a</font>

62
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,080
cassette and a pencil because when we're

63
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,030
like when I grew up anyway that was how

64
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,650
you fast-forward and rewind the tongues

65
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,810
you play a<font color="#E5E5E5"> song you know anything or I</font>

66
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,100
run my first walkman

67
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,280
only around 90 only fast-forwarded and

68
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,380
it didn't rewind so your passport a

69
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,300
zombie couldn't rewind the song so you

70
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,040
play the song<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want you dejected</font>

71
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,470
cassette from the Walkman and you'd use

72
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">your pencil in school to like rewind the</font>

73
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,488
song and put it back in and play it or

74
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:23,980
turn it on to the other side drover that

75
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,990
turning it on to the other side was like

76
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,010
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have no idea do you know man I</font>

77
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,560
have an ipod<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay when I don't know why</font>

78
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,200
never when DVDs first came out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

79
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,930

81
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,380
rewind it and if you didn't rewind the

82
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,680
video it was like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 50p fine you know</font>

never did it with this sauce and with

501
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,680
this I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good who's all</font>

502
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,310
tomahto so who cares but it looks good

503
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,380
it smells good the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Basel smells amazing</font>

504
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,920
I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably but it done I'll</font>

just put it down really low and i'm

00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:05,600
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set the table which whenever</font>

507
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,010
when we're on our own we never eat

508
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,810
dinner<font color="#E5E5E5"> tate whenever right at that table</font>

509
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,510
though it's just doing here which is

510
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,050
super dark but look it's so cute<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

511
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,970
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the candle lit and everything</font>

00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,290
showing you what the final cut

518
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,420
it looks like after I'm finished cooking

519
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,330
but the reason for that honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

520
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually I'm like I get really stressed</font>

523
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,870
everybody because I hate cooking and I'm

524
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,730
not any good at it so I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like</font>

525
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">really stressed out and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I always</font>

526
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">just like usually I'll fill them a</font>

527
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,700
little bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just get really</font>

528
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,260
stressed things will go wrong or

529
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,790
whatever things would go right it

530
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,440
doesn't matter i<font color="#CCCCCC"> just get stressed any</font>

531
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,630
weight and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just end up like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

533
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,200
not cooking so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the final product</font>

534
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,540
this is what it looks like and we shall

535
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if Jonathan likes that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or not</font>
