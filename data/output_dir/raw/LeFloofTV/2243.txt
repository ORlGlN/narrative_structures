this is what Jonathan he buys about five

71
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,890
pairs of slippers a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> because he</font>

72
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,290
decides after he's so weird with

73
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,710
Footwear even your socks remember last

74
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,400
time last time diesels oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hear ya i</font>

75
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,780
know they're the only shoes that you've

76
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,700
actually like sometimes he'll just

77
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,440
decide he doesn't like shoes anymore and

78
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,970
he'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like not wear them anymore</font>

79
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,950
and then they'll end up getting thrown

80
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,260
at next time we move that's what happens

81
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,650
so he's very strange<font color="#E5E5E5"> about socks and</font>

82
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,110
stuff like he used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal my socks</font>

83
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,510
until I gave him like four pairs so that

84
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,200
he would stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then um what else dude</font>

85
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,210
it's so what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have just a weird thing</font>

86
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,790
about Footwear so he buys slippers and

87
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,530
then he wears them for a while and then

88
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,210
he decides they're old and he wants a

89
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,240
