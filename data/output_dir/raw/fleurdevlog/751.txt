because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a bit too blonde at</font>

16
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,360
the moment I really like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tone of it</font>

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,510
it's kind of a she but I kind of want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">myself as better and I thought it would</font>

28
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,920
show you my hair and then of the

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,149
bathroom<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the lighting in here is</font>

30
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:02,280
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good but this is what my hair</font>

31
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,010
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a lot as ice might not a</font>

32
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,780
lot different but it's definitely a few

33
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,570
shades darker I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad at filming</font>

34
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,490
like this I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn to wrap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

35
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,040
yeah it's definitely a few shades darker

36
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,740
as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see like it's still blonde</font>

37
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,350
but um it's a bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a natural</font>

38
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">color and it matches my eyebrows a bit</font>

39
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">better as well so I really like that if</font>

40
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,140
I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a different light you might be</font>

41
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,159
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different it's</font>

42
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,200
really blue light in here switch the

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,110
local yeah so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit dark but</font>

44
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,610
I think it's more natural<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really</font>

45
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,920
really like it so yeah it's a pretty

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,240
boring drive down to be honest yeah not

47
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">much to report on that really just</font>

48
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,009
roadworks and driving and<font color="#E5E5E5"> road works but</font>

49
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,229
I'm off to see Tanya a gym now which I'm

50
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,189

summer collection which<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be kind of</font>

53
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,329
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> because um I always kind of</font>

54
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:58,920
forget that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll use a brand that does</font>

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,390
kind of seasonal styles i always just

56
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,159
think it does like the classic ugg boots

57
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,450
stuff but it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting to see</font>

58
