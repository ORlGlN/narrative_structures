not your classic like a horror but it's

45
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,040
creepy isn't it it's like more of a

46
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,860
suspense thriller um but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

47
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,209
good Martin Scorsese Leo DiCaprio

48
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:09,720

amazing was it your before in at my

66
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,570
number for Mike would argue this isn't

67
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,840
really a scary movie but for me it's a

68
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,360
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit scary because I have a mild</font>

69
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,459
obsession with zombies would you would

70
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">you agree with that statement like I'm</font>

71
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,200
big zombie fan but I'm also a little bit

72
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,510
scared of<font color="#E5E5E5"> zombies so in at number four</font>

73
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">is zombieland that's not a horror film</font>

74
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,739
that's a common it is kind of creepy

75
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:21,720
it's not it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a comedy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good comedy</font>

76
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,100
and it's slightly scary because it has

77
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,140
an awesome cameo from the neck that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

78
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,760
will not<font color="#CCCCCC"> say because it will ruin it but</font>

79
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,140
it fits my Halloween though right

80
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,820
because Halloween isn't always about

81
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,610
super scary spots about zombies<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

82
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">the most ultimate scary movies of all</font>

83
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,180
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not it well I hope</font>

84
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,489
