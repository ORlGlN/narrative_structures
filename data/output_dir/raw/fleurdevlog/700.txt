29
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,799
at the moment I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think June bugs kind of</font>

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,460
boring I thought about like valid like

36
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,520
of weird so if you guys can think of a

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,070
good name for vlogging every day in June

38
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,689

39
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,030
below the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I was going to</font>

40
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that over the last three</font>

41
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,320
weeks I've actually been getting really

42
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">into fitness which is really not like me</font>

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,259
at all if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys watched my April vlog</font>

44
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,420
kind of regularly might have seen that I

45
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,540
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of decided to take a few steps</font>

46
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,159
towards leading a bit of a healthier

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,829
lifestyle but as far as exercise was

48
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,860
going I hadn't really adjusted much I've

49
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,329
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to walk the dog more and</font>

50
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:58,680
just be a bit a little bit more active

51
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,320
and kind of just move a bit more but

52
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,899
since then I have decided to actually

53
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,570
start going to gym and properly working

54
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,489
out for summer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get kind of in a</font>

55
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:10,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of a better shape as well as</font>

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,700
eating healthily so I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

57
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,170
combine the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two now</font>

58
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,120
and it's going really really well I've

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,790
actually got personal trainer who I see

60
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,500
once a week and I found that even though

61
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,120
it's expensive to get a personal trainer

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,090
it really actually helps motivate me to

63
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,300
work out for the whole of the week and

64
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,790
to be honest for me that is a kind of

65
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,730
priceless thing to have because I am so

66
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,110
bad at most fitting myself to go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

67
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,630
gym I've never stuck to a kind of

68
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,700
exercise routine beyond like two weeks

69
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,500
before and I'm in the fourth week now so

70
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,980

actually outside look at the sky it's so

100
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,070
sunny the weather has been incredible

101
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,959
for the last week in England and it's

106
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,530
little less<font color="#E5E5E5"> honey but apart from that</font>

107
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,019

110
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,569
into vlogging<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyday again I find it</font>

111
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:14,549
weird like when I'm in a routine I'm

112
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:15,870
used to vlogging everyday i find it

113
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,488
really really easy but like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said</font>

114
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:19,440
having a month without vlogging<font color="#E5E5E5"> i find</font>

115
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,390
it hard to like have something to vlog

116
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,849
about it sounds really<font color="#E5E5E5"> odd but just kind</font>

117
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:25,800
of works like that I don't know anyway I

118
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">pull</font>

119
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:28,129
wearing sunglasses I've got the most

120
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:30,979
watery eye in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole world for really</font>

121
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,960
itchy face as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well but my eye is just</font>

122
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,999
like streaming and streaming so it's

123
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:36,529
really sensitive to light I don't know

124
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:38,300
what I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it last night it's just</font>

125
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,490
started watering and it hasn't stopped

126
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,930
since it doesn't hurt or anything it's

127
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,180
just watering it's like I'm crying out

128
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,900
one I for like 24 hours oh well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>
