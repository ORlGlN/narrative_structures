00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:09,780
asking you guys if you had any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,639
about confidence I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that was slightly back to</font>

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,940
school specific because um I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,380
it's that kind of time of year<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought confidence was a great one</font>

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,340
because the one number<font color="#CCCCCC"> one thing I think</font>

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,570
you need for<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to school</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

12
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,920
confidence now I'm filming this on my

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,300
iPad so I'm not entirely sure how it's

14
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,980
going to work out I apologize<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

15
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,390
lack of good quality normally my task

22
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,260
which will be after I put this up so it

23
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,670

the questions so number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lippy</font>

25
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,270
and mascara on twitter says how do you

26
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,649
gain confidence when surrounded by

27
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">gorgeous and successful people it is</font>

28
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,539
difficult sometimes if say if your

29
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,530
friends are you know get more attention

30
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,510
than you<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more successful in</font>

their work at<font color="#E5E5E5"> school if guys like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

32
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">or it can be a little bit difficult to</font>

33
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,100
or it can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of knock your confidence</font>

34
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,720
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think what you've got</font>

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,430
to remember in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of situation is</font>

36
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,590
what you bring to the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> why you're</font>

37
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,290
different why you're special and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not</font>

38
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,909
necessarily compare yourself to others

39
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,630
as much you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you can like it's</font>

40
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,570
impossible you can't be nobody's<font color="#CCCCCC"> perfect</font>

41
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">and nobody and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you don't want</font>

42
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be somebody else like you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

43
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:39,960
an individual and you need to remember

44
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,090
why your friends are friends with you

45
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,799
while you're surrounded by<font color="#CCCCCC"> these kind of</font>

46
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,079
gorgeous successful people who obviously

47
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,810
like you think friends so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

48
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,780
kind of remember that everybody's

49
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,220
individual everybody is going to have

50
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,869
their strengths and their weaknesses you

51
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:56,790
might not have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the longest legs you</font>

52
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,320
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have the best-looking</font>

53
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,479
boyfriend you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever but at the</font>

54
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,189
end of the day like you have some great

55
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,140
qualities that other people don't so you

56
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,369
know individuals<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all different and</font>

57
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:07,170
you can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of compare yourself to</font>

58
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,080
others too much the next question is

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,060
beauty related it comes from rodarte

60
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,080
rebel on<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter</font>

61
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,510
asking i often get shy wearing bold

62
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,490
lipstick out do you have any tips for

63
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,890
being more confident with lip color I

64
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely do because I used to be</font>

65
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,610
really self-conscious when it came to

66
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,610
wearing bright lipstick like really bad

67
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,790
and over the years I<font color="#CCCCCC"> found that I've got</font>

68
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,710
more confident wearing it I think the

69
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,210
trick is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of introduce</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself</font>

70
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,880
slowly so maybe start by buying a bright

71
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,710
lipstick but using it kind of dabbed on

72
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,450
the lips instead of just straight out

73
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">Matt bright color you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do that or you</font>

74
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,480
can also try making the rest of your

75
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">makeup really neutral so try say wearing</font>

76
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">no eyeshadow just eyeliner and mascara</font>

77
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,780
obviously like<font color="#E5E5E5"> foundation if you want to</font>

78
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,400
wear that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of different but no</font>

79
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,810
other color on your face apart from the

80
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,040
lipstick<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it can look really great</font>

81
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,080
and it also makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a lot easier to</font>

82
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">wear because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't look kind of too</font>

83
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,340
much apart<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that I mean try wearing</font>

84
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,750
around the house first when I find it it

85
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,570
is more scary actually wearing bright

86
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,000
colors like when you're out and about if

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,709
you try<font color="#CCCCCC"> wearing them at home first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

88
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:15,240
kind of get a bit more used to seeing as

89
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,160
I've wearing them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and therefore will get</font>

90
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,650
a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more confident wearing them</font>

91
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,540
so number three is from cherry on the

92
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,550
cake on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter and she asked have you</font>

93
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,050
always been confident or is it something

94
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,540
that you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned I wouldn't say I am</font>

95
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,850
100-percent the most confident person in

96
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,709
the world but confidence is definitely

97
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:34,230
something that has grown for me with

98
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,959
time when I was a teenager I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was wasn't</font>

99
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,209
look half as confident as I am now I

100
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,320
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just something that you learn</font>

101
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,130
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal with like self-confidence</font>

102
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,620
issues and you kind of learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> steal</font>

103
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,050
them as you get older I guess through

104
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,970
your experiences in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your life save</font>

105
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,290
something knocks your confidence you

106
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,420
kind of learn how to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and it</font>

107
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,580
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult and really like there</font>

108
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,320
are various tips that I can give you

109
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,470
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you know try and like</font>

110
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,090
realize the positives in life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

111
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,019
like that but at the end of the day a

112
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,330
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it is down to experience and</font>

113
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,670
sometimes you do have to be not to get

114
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,480
back up again so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't always</font>

115
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,829
been the most confident but I definitely

116
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,470
definitely have grown in confidence and

117
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,649
I would say if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are feeling</font>

118
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:24,120
self-conscious and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of not very</font>

119
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,690
confident in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your teens</font>

120
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,430
probably something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will diminish</font>

121
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,560
with time as you get older<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially in</font>

122
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,330
terms of actually confidence in social

123
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,360
situations telephoning people used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

124
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,890
terrified telephoning people for some

125
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,560
reason and now it's just a non-issue I

126
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,760
think the more you do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more</font>

127
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,950
you expose yourself to something in

128
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,050
social situations then you know

129
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">eventually it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to become easy and</font>

130
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,800
it's kind of got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> become an everyday</font>

131
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,880
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number for this kind of</font>

132
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,100
links into it<font color="#CCCCCC"> makeup for biochem on</font>

133
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,050
Twitter asks how much more confident

134
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,580
have you become in real life social

135
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,260
situations it's starting YouTube and

136
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,940
this is a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question because YouTube</font>

137
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,800
has definitely given me a lot a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

138
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,320
confidence both in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my real life</font>

139
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also in terms of kind of YouTube</font>

140
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,840
related things when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> on YouTube</font>

141
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,730
you're exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a lot of people</font>

142
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously and you're also exposed to</font>

143
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,280
potential criticism which is never nice

144
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,410
but definitely getting constructive

145
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,420
criticism from people does help to build

146
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,160
your confidence in a way because the

147
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,110
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> you learn to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it the more</font>

148
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,550
confident you are in yourself and the

149
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,770
more you<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn to either ignore like</font>

150
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,440
negative criticism which is unlike not

151
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,540
constructive at all it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able</font>

152
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,190
to ignore it but also it's good to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

153
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,419
able to learn how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take constructive</font>

154
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:41,350
criticism and use it wisely and it also

155
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,240
helps to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build your confidence when you</font>

156
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,890
do that because you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

157
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,950
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something better or if you learn</font>

158
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make a change to something that</font>

159
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're doing because of our criticism</font>

160
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,150
that someone's given you then that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

161
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,890
just a measure of confidence in itself

162
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you have to be confident I think</font>

163
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,810
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take on criticism say okay</font>

164
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,970
I'll accept that and change something

165
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,770
like I think that takes confidence to do

166
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,169
that so youtube's definitely helped<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

167
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:06,970
in terms of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and being able to deal</font>

168
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,669
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in my real life also another</font>

169
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,260
thing through<font color="#E5E5E5"> youtube</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i've actually</font>

170
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,970
attended quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of events</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

171
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,240
example like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Edinburgh TV festival i</font>

172
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,570
attended last week<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never have</font>

173
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,910
been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go up on a panel and speak</font>

174
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,890
in front of loads of people in a

175
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,890
basically lecture theatre before i

176
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,090
started youtube it would have absolutely

177
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,550
terrified me but now I mean I got a

178
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,960
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit nervous before I went on but</font>

179
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,280
it was mainly kind of butterflies I was

180
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,080
more kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of excited about meeting</font>

181
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,200
people and actually

182
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,880
the questions I wasn't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> nervous</font>

183
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,440
about being there at all I wasn't

184
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">nervous about meeting the people I was</font>

185
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,000
on the panel with and I think that it's

186
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,230
something definitely changes with

187
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,450
YouTube putting yourself out there for

188
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,740
the world sorry about the gist rain will

189
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,450
he's moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> around putting yourself out</font>

190
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,010
there for the world is<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely a</font>

191
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,870
daunting prospect but it seriously can

192
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,910
majorly<font color="#E5E5E5"> help with your confidence in</font>

193
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,320
terms of real life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's definitely</font>

194
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that I advocate if you're a</font>

195
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,590
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit shy and you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scared of</font>

196
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,260
doing YouTube just jump in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it and</font>

197
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">it will seriously from my experience</font>

198
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,670
anyway it's made me much much more

199
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,590
confident in real life<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the final</font>

200
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,260
question comes from the weezer<font color="#CCCCCC"> HM 26 and</font>

201
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,120
she asks how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you can have</font>

202
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,590
the confidence to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be different for</font>

203
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,750
example everyone thinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's weird that</font>

204
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,460
I don't drink and this is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

205
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,410
interesting one not drinking personally

206
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,110
I'm inclined to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say if somebody thinks</font>

207
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,540
you're weird for not doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> something or</font>

208
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,640
doing something that you disagree with

209
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">or agree with like not drinking or not</font>

210
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,620
smoking me personally I'm inclined<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

211
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,170
just tell them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to shove it because I am</font>

212
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,450
like that but if you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

213
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">younger I understand when you're a</font>

214
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,420
teenager is it sometimes can be really

215
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,550
hard with peer pressure and especially

216
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,290
with drinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> and smoking sometimes</font>

217
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,580
people like oh you're not cool because

218
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,620
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've always been</font>

219
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,800
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of stubborn when it</font>

220
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,820
comes especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> when it comes to</font>

221
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,990
smoking because I've always been avidly

222
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,300
anti-smoking even when all my friends

223
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,830
thought it was really cool when we have

224
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,540
like 15 and they're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah having a</font>

225
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,310
cigarette and kind of don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

226
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,040
and I'm like no gross kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing I've</font>

227
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,270
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> been quite a strong world when it</font>

228
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,100
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that but in terms of building</font>

229
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">your confidence to avoid situations like</font>

230
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,170
that and to stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> people thinking that</font>

231
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,420
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird I definitely think you just</font>

232
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to prove yourself as being equally</font>

233
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,690
as fun equally as nice a person when you

234
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't do that and a great example of</font>

235
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,350
somebody who does this amazingly well is

236
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,419
Jim my friend Tanya's boyfriend who's

237
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,039
Jimmy Baba<font color="#E5E5E5"> on YouTube he doesn't drink</font>

238
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,200
but he still remains to be a really fun

239
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">person to hang out with if you go out</font>

240
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">for drinks with him or for dinner with</font>

241
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,919
him or if you go out to a bar whatever

242
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,050
he<font color="#CCCCCC"> is still a really fun guy to hang</font>

243
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">around with him the fact that he's not</font>

244
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,070
drinking like you don't even notice so I

245
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing if you don't make</font>

246
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,400
a point of

247
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,220
and you don't kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of preach to people I</font>

248
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,350
think it's definitely good to defend

249
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,150
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to be able to like say if</font>

250
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are mocking you for not doing I</font>

251
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,140
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's good to be kind of confident</font>

252
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,730
in yourself to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say because I disagree</font>

253
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,380
with it but don't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge thing of</font>

254
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,910
it don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like oh look down on other</font>

255
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,160
people for choosing to do it this is

256
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,680
more of a kind of like moral thing

257
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,480
rather than having confidence but in

258
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,070
terms of gaining confidence to be able

259
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,590
to do that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just think you really have</font>

260
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,890
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have belief in yourself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that your</font>

261
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,870
decisions are the best for you and you

262
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,570
also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just remember that like you</font>

263
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,890
can't let other people dictate what you

264
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,300
do to your life especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> when it comes</font>

265
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,620
to things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like things like drinking and</font>

266
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">smoking which can be really unhealthy</font>

267
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,610
for you so if you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font>

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,150
somebody kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of effectively bully you</font>

00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,650
into doing something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want</font>

270
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,300
to do and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is bad for your body then</font>

271
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,490
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really bad of them and to be</font>

272
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,690
honest you don't worry front of them if

273
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,680
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that because it's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">not a cool thing to do that was a</font>
