17
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,750
London this whole week to do with work

18
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,940
so I'm away from home so I'm away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

19
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,370
all of my makeup and my general setup my

20
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,480
lighting setup and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ings like that so it</font>

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,010
makes it really hard to film youtube

22
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,899
videos and then last weekend I was

23
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually an Edinburgh which if you saw</font>

24
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,129
my last but one I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> videos on here</font>

25
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:51,629
you'll know that I was in Edinburgh and

26
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:53,879
I had a really good time and I didn't

27
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,469
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up filming as much as I wanted to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

28
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:56,640
wanted to do like quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

29
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,770
following me around<font color="#CCCCCC"> for years when I was</font>

30
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">there but I got there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the weather</font>

31
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,210
was awful like horrendous it was so

32
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,600
windy and so rainy and just impossible

33
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,890
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> film like it's not bad to walk around</font>

34
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,570
in I took wellies with me so it's fine

35
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,850
but filming in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rain is bad because</font>

36
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,100
you just have water coming into cameras

37
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,960
and things like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I took a little</font>

38
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of footage of the cupcake or I think</font>

39
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,700
it's called like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dessert bar in</font>

40
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,409
harvey nichols and<font color="#E5E5E5"> edinburgh which i</font>

41
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:23,400
might insert at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this video</font>

42
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,869
because that was really really fun we

43
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,520
had chocolate fondue and then we also

44
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,650
went on a ghost tour and I really wanted

45
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,840
to film that but we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this ghost</font>

46
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,799
tour and I thought it's gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really</font>

47
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,750
scary the friend that I was with says

48
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">she had been on two before basically as</font>

49
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,729
two different ghost tours in tempura two

50
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:39,960
different types is also two different

51
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">companies which I'll get to in a minute</font>

52
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,479
there's two different types is one where

53
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,009
you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> around graveyard and then there's</font>

54
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,930
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one we're all numerous</font>

55
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,430
graveyards we didn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one and</font>

56
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">then there's one way you go underground</font>

57
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,399
into the like underground vaults

58
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,979
underneath the bridge<font color="#E5E5E5"> and emre and my</font>

59
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,299
friend had done both of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and she</font>

60
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:55,590
said the vault one is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

61
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,060
scary and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be really cool and we</font>

62
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,350
didn't do it like because we were going

63
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,630
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> for dinner that night so and we kind</font>

64
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,250
of had plans already so we didn't do it

65
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,479
a night we did it like four thirty in

66
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,390
the afternoon and it was not scary like

67
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,160
we chose the wrong company we went with

68
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,560
the city<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dead tools I think instead</font>

69
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,000
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other company that did them and</font>

70
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,540
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically like</font>

71
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,849
being in someone's cellar and it was

72
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:18,219
like next<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a restaurant and you go</font>

73
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:19,780
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> these rooms and you can hear the</font>

74
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,040
people in the restaurant next to looks

75
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,560
like you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like ruin the</font>

76
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,760
mood and you could hear like you have to

77
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,379
like walk over that office isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

78
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,670
it's just not that scary and there was

79
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,500
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> like three rooms the guy doing the</font>

80
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,879
tour was really good he had quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

81
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">of good stories to tell but the actual</font>

82
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:34,569
place where we wasn't scary and my

83
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,189
friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> said the last time she</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> went was</font>

84
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,170
way scarier and the vaults were much

85
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,030
bigger and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just more space and</font>

86
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,530
kind of you could have potentially got

87
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,909
lost things like that whereas this was

88
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:45,400
like not scary at all so I didn't end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

89
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,739
filming in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because it wasn't</font>

90
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:49,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">really scary and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there wasn't like gonna</font>

91
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,280
be funny with us kind of freaking out it

92
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,900
was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> us kind of being like this is</font>

93
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,909
kind of creepy and we won't like a

94
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:56,200
little bit scared like a little bit

95
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,030
unnerved because it's like dark and<font color="#E5E5E5"> damp</font>

96
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,150
but nothing scary happened and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

97
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,439
know it wasn't I didn't find it that

98
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:04,180
scary but it was kind of a good

99
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,829
experience to do it anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I go again</font>

100
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:08,169
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely want to do the graveyard</font>

101
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:09,879
talk at night as well because i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think i</font>

102
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">would be really scared and I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

103
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">know why I like being scared it's like a</font>

104
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:14,680
love hate relationship for me with<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

105
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,599
scared sometimes I'm like I hate

106
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,739
watching scary movies but there's

107
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,120
something about them that I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

108
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,459
stop watching them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I love them so</font>

109
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:23,290
apart from that talking of movies i went

110
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,900
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a preview of no strings attached</font>

111
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,150
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ashton Kutcher and Natalie</font>

112
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">Portman's new film</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put that sounded</font>

113
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">like some nasty Portland Natalie</font>

114
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">Portman's new film and it's just like a</font>

115
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:39,129
rom-com kind of girly film and I

116
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:40,840
actually really enjoyed it normally I'm

117
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,909
a little bit hard to please with chick

118
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:44,829
flicks<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually really like this</font>

119
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">tonight with my sister along to it's not</font>

120
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:47,500
out in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UK</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think I think it's</font>

121
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,780
been out in<font color="#CCCCCC"> America for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few weeks but</font>

122
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,129
I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes out this week in</font>

123
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:53,379
England I think I don't know I'm not

124
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:55,389
only potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you want kind of</font>

125
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:56,859
like a mini review i would say it's

126
00:03:56,859 --> 00:03:58,959
definitely worth seeing it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

127
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,239
must-see movie but if you want to go to

128
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:02,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cinema with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of your friends and</font>

129
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:05,199
see a fun girly film then that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

130
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,310
funny and it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to see</font>

131
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,400
Natalie Portman in a kind of jokey role

132
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,169
because obviously she's done Black Swan

133
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:12,699
so recently it's kind of nice that she's

134
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,799
got a really serious role and then kind

135
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,298
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a jokey role coming out at the same</font>

136
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,769
time well obviously it's a little bit

137
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">later than Black Swan but a similar time</font>

138
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,399
and you kind of get to see more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of her</font>

139
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,250
and relax kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of funny side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of her so I</font>

140
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,039
did really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that so I went to see</font>

141
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:27,400
that

142
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,540
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying to think of anything</font>
