a big effort either paint like properly

47
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:54,930
clear out and everything and buy a new

whether or not and that will kind of

52
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,780
tide me over for probably a few months

53
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe six months or whether it's worth</font>

54
