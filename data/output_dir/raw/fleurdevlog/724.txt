00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
hey guys and welcome to April vlog day<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7</font>

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,390
so today you due<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a lack of anything</font>

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,710
particularly interesting going on in my

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,660
life I decided to do the youtuber tag I

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,210
love doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> tags when I kind of have</font>

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,799
nothing specific to blog about because

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,420
otherwise I<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys would get</font>

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,910
bored so I one<font color="#E5E5E5"> tagged where anyone in</font>

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,800
particular to do this tag but my really

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,199
good friends Tanya and her boyfriend Jim

11
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,880
both have done it and they tagged

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,609
everybody well Jim<font color="#E5E5E5"> tagged everybody</font>

13
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,230
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember if Tanya tagged everybody</font>

14
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,490
or not but Jim definitely did so

15
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,098
technically Jim tagged me ok so there

16
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,170
are 13 questions number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one what do you</font>

17
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,940
like most about YouTube and this is easy

18
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,020
for me because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the reason why i</font>

19
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,670
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing youtube in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first place</font>

20
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,309
it's the fact that it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

21
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,379
amazing platform to find people with

22
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:44,820
similar interest to you the reason why i

23
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,550
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing beauty videos on youtube</font>

24
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,960
is because none of my friends and<font color="#CCCCCC"> family</font>

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,000
were really that into beauty they were

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,789
kind of um you know they wear makeup and

27
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,170
stuff but they weren't like obsessed

28
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,449
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obsessed so that's why I</font>

29
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:58,949
started and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I most like</font>

30
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,320
about it it just is the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> incredible</font>

31
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,539
network of people and it puts you in

32
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,010
touch with lots of other lovely<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

33
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,580
who like the same things number two what

34
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,260
do you dislike most about YouTube<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

35
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,930
one is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy it's the bugs if you</font>

36
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,670
guys use YouTube a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot you will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

37
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,640
there are a lot of annoying bugs so the

38
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,350
thing was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the moment is the</font>

39
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,509
automatic update on the comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

40
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,490
irritating<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's also known stuff</font>

41
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,220
about view counts and a bug mess that up

42
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,430
for a while the inbox system is crazy

43
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,780
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of the technical stuff about</font>

44
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube I find the most annoying number</font>

45
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,299
three who inspired you to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> videos i</font>

46
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,119
watched a few people before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i started</font>

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">making videos and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think most</font>

48
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,409
specifically they were lollipop 26 who

49
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,680
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make videos anymore Laura Blair</font>

50
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,360
juicystar 07 I watched at the very

51
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,840
beginning kandeejohnson and all the kind

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,399
of older youtubers that have been going

53
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">for kind of three years or more I kind</font>

54
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,909
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> watched them for a while and then the</font>

55
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,740
person actually inspired me to start

56
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,270
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> my own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> videos like to actually</font>

57
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,340
take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> jump was my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mum because um I</font>

58
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,920
showed her you earlier I showed her a

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,330
review of some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of skin</font>

60
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,740
roanoke Sekot me what it was that she

61
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,990
wanted to buy one day<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of told her</font>

62
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the whole thing and she was like</font>

63
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,530
you should do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you usually would be</font>

64
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,520
good at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you should do it you should</font>

65
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,170
do it and basically push me into doing

66
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,360
it and now we've got her to thank

67
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,890
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's amazing number four what do</font>

68
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to achieve on YouTube and have</font>

69
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,660
you achieved it yet I think my goals

70
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,040
change all the time with YouTube because

71
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,450
i remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> when i first started i</font>

72
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,420
thought if i can get like 50 followers

73
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,950
whatever it will be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most amazing</font>

74
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,450
like 50 people want to watch my video

75
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,880
that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be amazing and now i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think i</font>

76
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,350
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 50 subscribes in the first</font>

77
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,200
four<font color="#E5E5E5"> days so that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like my goal the</font>

78
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,430
chief right there but then obviously

79
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,340
once that happens you then look to

80
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,560
bigger goal so then it was 500

81
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,030
subscribers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was a thousand</font>

82
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,640
subscribers and i remember when i hit

83
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,530
10,000 subscribers i literally was

84
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,380
dancing around the kitchen it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was huge</font>

85
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,590
huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was like so excited</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it but</font>

86
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,720
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you grow more and more</font>

87
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,440
you become kind of not numb to it but

88
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,209
you just look towards bigger goals i

89
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:15,160
guess so i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really have yeah</font>

90
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,260
actually no that's not right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do have</font>

91
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,940
goals but they change every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> i reach</font>

92
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,280
them i<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't like kind of ever reach a</font>

93
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,450
goal and think right that's it I've

94
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,590
achieved everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to achieve</font>

95
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">now and I think that would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be pretty sad</font>

96
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,880
if I did that if I was like that's

97
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,380
enough I'm gonna stop now I've achieved

98
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,769
it so yeah and the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> big goal for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

99
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:34,420
is 300,000 subscribers because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

100
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the moment on my beauty channel i'm</font>

101
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,570
at like to 55 or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

102
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,920
three hundred thousands like the next

103
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,489
big big one<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me so and then a hundred</font>

104
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:46,750
thousand for this channel as well which

105
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,930
is not too far off i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm at 92,000</font>

106
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,690
10 filming this but yeah so they change

107
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,370
all the time number five if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font>

108
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,709
change anything about<font color="#E5E5E5"> youtube what would</font>

109
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:59,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">it be like i said before probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

110
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,870
glitches the upload speed as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

111
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,130
although that's probably my internet

112
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,200
rather than youtube<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get so frustrated</font>

113
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">cuz i don't live in london or in a big</font>

114
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,660
city and if you live in a big city you

115
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">get much faster internet speeds so</font>

116
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,200
whenever I go down to London upload a

117
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,730
video uploads like five times faster

118
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,839
than if I uploaded at home which is

119
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">really frustrating so that's what I</font>

120
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,760
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> change about you g6 what kind of</font>

121
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,990
videos do you do if you're watching this

122
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">video</font>

123
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,880
pretty sure you will know that I do

124
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,970
beauty videos if not I do cutie videos

125
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,889
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> beauty reviews kind of favorites</font>

126
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:32,620
top products the occasional tutorial but

127
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,450
not too many because I'm not a

128
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,190
professional makeup artist so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

129
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,070
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> teaching everybody things on a</font>

130
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,710
daily basis about how to apply makeup

131
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,639
but I do like to do the occasional

132
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,560
tutorial as well and then this channel

133
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,860
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for kind of me random stuff</font>

134
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,500
about me and daily vlogging and this

135
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,270
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing logging every day every</font>

136
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">other month because I didn't quite feel</font>

137
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,180
that I could live up to the challenge of

138
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,120
vlog year so i decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do every other</font>

139
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,910
month and it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so far April's</font>

140
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,660
going pretty fast so far in fact I think

141
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,830
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7 do you wish you had more</font>

142
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,919
subscribers um that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a funny</font>

143
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,780
question because I'm overwhelmed<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the</font>

144
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,729
amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that are subscribed to</font>

147
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,780

people to see and so yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would I</font>

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,630
moment as well so a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this and that</font>

157
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,610
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 how many people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

159
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,720
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the region of 50</font>

160
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,930
to 100 that is very very vague<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,270
really know number nine no number<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten if</font>

00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:07,060
get hate i'm actually quite lucky don't

166
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,870
get too much hate fingers<font color="#E5E5E5"> crossed and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

167
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,370
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you put yourself on youtube</font>

168
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,580
you are putting yourself out there to

169
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,660
everybody in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole world to watch</font>

170
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,340
and potentially criticize your videos

171
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,590
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think you have to be aware of that</font>

172
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,760
there are people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that aren't very nice</font>

173
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,680
in the world and if you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting</font>

174
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,450
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> online to everybody then some</font>

175
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,380
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't going to like you and</font>

176
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,070
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that they don't</font>

177
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you and because they're hidden</font>

178
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:30,550
behind a computer they sometimes say

179
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,930
things that are really inappropriate in

180
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">the wooden station in real life so you</font>

181
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">just have to kind of put it into</font>

182
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:36,760
perspective delete block if they're

183
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,129
really

184
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:39,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">see if they're like abusive but yeah I</font>

185
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:41,779
don't let<font color="#E5E5E5"> it bother me too much I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

186
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:43,759
think over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> period of two and a half</font>

187
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,110
years I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing YouTube I've got</font>

188
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,719
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> upset about nasty comments</font>

189
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:50,029
probably twice which i think is pretty

190
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:51,830
good going like like generally like

191
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,569
don't let it<font color="#CCCCCC"> get to me and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of the</font>

192
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:56,479
time there's things to be taken from

193
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,209
hate as well like if obviously not blind

194
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:00,589
hate but if people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually making</font>

195
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:02,599
criticisms of your videos then sometimes

196
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:04,489
there's something to look out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

197
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:06,919
yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just generally ignore it and</font>

198
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:08,330
block and delete if they're really

199
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,339
abusive that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much how I deal</font>

200
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:13,879
with it 11 do you have a lot of friends

201
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,259
on YouTube this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite question</font>

202
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:17,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the first question what do you</font>

203
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,069
most like about YouTube is kind of 5050

204
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:20,689
whether I was going to say that I've

205
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:22,879
made friends but I think what I said to

206
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first question about how it's an</font>

207
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,759
amazing community also kind of leads on

208
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,499
to this that I've met so many amazing

00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:04,399
of blog focused and specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube</font>

224

I've met lots of people through what I'm

229
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:18,110
doing and what is cool like i said in

230
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,699
the answer to question one is that they

231
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,169
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> similar interests which is awesome</font>

232
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:23,089
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i love it and i love all of my new</font>

233
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:24,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">friends well they don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really know</font>

234
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:25,550
anymore cuz<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been on YouTube for</font>

235
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,300
like two and a half years number 12 what

236
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,279
is a piece of<font color="#CCCCCC"> advice you would give to a</font>

237
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,679
beginner on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube it would definitely</font>

238
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,009
be be<font color="#E5E5E5"> persistent and like with your</font>

239
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:39,799
videos be persistent and consistent I

240
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,509
don't know whether that's contradictory

241
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:44,269
um persistent in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that you don't</font>

242
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:46,639
give up and don't let anything kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

243
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,630
get you down you're not going to get

244
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,830
thousands and millions

245
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,110
views in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first week because nobody</font>

246
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,940
has seen you yet and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes a while to</font>

247
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,510
kind of get people kind of aware of your

248
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,580
channel so it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a while and it</font>

249
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,920
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> frustrating so be persistent and</font>

250
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,130
be consistent with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your videos so and I</font>

251
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,500
mean upload however many you can but if

252
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,420
you're uploading what a week or you can

253
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,130
upload one a week kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stick to that</font>

254
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,690
rather than uploading five in one week

255
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,760
and then none for a month or you know

256
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,260
vice versa whatever so I mean I I yeah

257
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,340
yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's my advice and try be a</font>

258
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,370
bit different<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well because I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

259
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,420
was fairly lucky like when I started

260
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">there weren't that many people they</font>

261
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,680
weren't quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it</font>

262
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,700
to be fair there were loads of people

263
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,770
but now it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

264
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,240
exploded and there's so many new

265
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,790
channels out there that I think be kind

266
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">of different and be yourself and let</font>

267
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,510
your personality shine through and then

268
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,370
I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what makes you different</font>

269
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,450
because everybody has different

270
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,900
personalities and that is my advice be

271
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,260
yourself be<font color="#E5E5E5"> persistent and be consistent</font>

272
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:55,550
um number 13 the last question<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are</font>

273
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,620
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite types of video my favorite</font>

274
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,540

275
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,040
definitely like monthly favorites I

276
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,620
really like them I don't watch so many

278
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,680
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> first started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but i think i've seen so</font>

279
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,140
