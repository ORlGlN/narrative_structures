<font color="#E5E5E5">things i bought this in vlogs but</font>

22
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,710

23
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,090
quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys might</font>

24
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,160
want to see but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not necessarily</font>

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,480
beauty and fashion related i thought i

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,649
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> put it on this channel so</font>

27
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically i bought a load of books and</font>

28
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,140
if you guys didn't watch my la<font color="#E5E5E5"> vlogging</font>

29
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,760
you might not know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my kindle</font>

30
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,799
on the plane how annoying is that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,290
literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm kicking myself still</font>

32
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,350
however I've kind of rediscovered

33
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,909
reading real book so I really I'm kind

34
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:13,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">of starting to enjoy reading real books</font>

35
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,080
again but whenever I travel I'm like oh

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,820
so annoying because I don't ever want to

37
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,350
take my book because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a big fat</font>

38
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,540
heavy book and it takes up like half my

39
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,450
handbag so I do miss kind of taking a

40
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,650
book with me on the train and things

41
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,549
like that because I haven't been doing

42
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,890
that but anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> I bought a whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

43
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">new books and most of these was actually</font>

44
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,420
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much all of these pretty much</font>

45
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,490
with suggestions from you guys when I

46
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,060
did my favorite books video so thank you

47
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the suggestions and I will get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

48
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,200
show you what I bought the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing</font>

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,540
was probably one of the most highly

50
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,950
recommended ones and it's the maze

51
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,460
runner this is as a she says on the top

52
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,140
a must for fans of The Hunger Games this

53
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">is like really widely compared to them</font>

54
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,790
the games and I can see why in the story

55
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,740
I'll read<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back to you it says when</font>

56
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">the doors lift when the doors of the</font>

57
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,780
lift crank open the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing Thomas</font>

58
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,000
can remember is his first name but he's

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,128
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> alone he's surrounded</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by boys who</font>

60
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,649
welcome him to the glade an encampment

61
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:11,400
as

62
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,989
center of a bizarre and terrible maze

63
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,840
like Thomas the Gladers don't know why

64
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">or how they came to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there or what's</font>

65
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,650
happened to the world outside all they

66
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,000
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that every morning when the</font>

67
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,650
walls slide back they will risk

68
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,930
everything to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out so I think the</font>

69
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,790
sounds really really exciting most of

70
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,310
the books that I got are actually kind

71
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,769
of based on a futuristic dystopian kind

72
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:35,159
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> society I think partly because in my</font>

73
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:37,409
favorite book video I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

74
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:39,680
how much i love the hunger games and

75
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,269
what else did<font color="#CCCCCC"> i say i love during that I</font>

76
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:44,370
can't even remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> but anyway I think</font>

77
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,870
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but I'm loving the</font>

78
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,700
sound of that the second one I picked up

79
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">is noughts and crosses by Malorie</font>

80
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,799
Blackman and this is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

81
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,480
interesting i haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> i heard a lot</font>

82
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,829
about the major on for I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't heard</font>

83
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:58,019
so much about this and on the back it

84
00:02:58,019 --> 00:02:59,790
says cameras are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a second-class</font>

85
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,829
citizen in a world run by the ruling

00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:04,739
crosses<font color="#CCCCCC"> seffy is a cross daughter of one</font>

87
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:05,879
of the most powerful men in the country

88
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,889
in their world noughts and crosses

89
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:10,980
simply don't mix and as hostility turns

90
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,560
to violence can calamus<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fe possibly find</font>

91
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,569
a way to be together they are determined

92
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,819
to try and then the bomb explodes so

93
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,650
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how exciting and I can't wait to</font>

94
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">read that and then the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one I got</font>

95
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,690
was the first book<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the game of</font>

96
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,260
thrones line is ashley i think it's

97
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,019
called a song of fire and ice I don't

98
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,359
know whether ya book one of a song for a

99
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:35,159
nice as the game of thrones this was

100
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,790
basically recommended to me by a lots

101
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,319
and lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people and what I was in la</font>

102
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">visiting my friend Ingrid she said how</font>

103
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:43,650
much she loved the TV show and I haven't

104
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen any of the TV show and but I know</font>

105
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,519
she loved the book as well so I thought

106
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">I prefer to read the book first before i</font>

107
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,180
watch the TV show so I got that it's

108
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,400
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a heavy book so I don't</font>

109
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,530
know when I think I'm less<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited to</font>

110
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,819
read this than the other one so I don't

111
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,900
know when I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get around to</font>

112
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,449
reading that it might even be like in

113
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">the summer of my summer holidays but I'm</font>

114
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,879

115
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,840

116
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,459
highly recommended to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and I actually</font>

117
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,879
saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in a video that L all verses 21</font>

118
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,000
did and it sounded really cool very

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,810
simple as hungry

120
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,959
games kind of thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the book is like</font>

121
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,060
amazing for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like a holographic</font>

122
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,700
book cover I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think it's</font>

123
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,220

124
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,840

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,460
books um in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my book video but then I</font>

128
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,020
realized I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't actually remember who I</font>

129
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,790
then 22<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I left it somebody a</font>

130
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,680
long time ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

131
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,419
reread it so I bought me one of these

132
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,370
and these were all really good prices I

133
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,200
don't know if you guys order books from

134
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,580
Amazon at a lot but they were all like

135
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,850
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> three most number three and four</font>

136
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,350
pounds i think one was six I can't

137
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,180
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> which one was six but and they</font>

138
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,440
were all a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheaper than there would</font>

139
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,450
be if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy them in the shops yeah so</font>

140
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,910
that's what I got book wise i also got a

141
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,300
few bits of technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> technologies I</font>

142
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,900
got a new tripod whoo how exciting is

143
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,820
this I know this isn't massively

144
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,380
exciting what I know a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people who</font>

145
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,610
watch my videos actually make their own

146
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,970
videos so um I thought you might find it

147
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,400
interesting to know about when you equip

148
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,490
an eyeball so this tripod the tripod

149
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,990
that my camera is standing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on right now</font>

150
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,520
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys are sitting right there</font>

151
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,039
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually like a death trap for my</font>

152
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,440
camera it's an amazing tripod it's

153
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,590
called the Sun pack travel smart and it

154
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,840
was so so good because it folds up to a

155
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,110
teeny tiny thing like literally half the

156
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,180
size of this and it goes really high

157
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,970
like as tall as me and it has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

158
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,190
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really light and everything but the</font>

159
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:51,419
a lot of the features<font color="#E5E5E5"> like how you move</font>

160
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,160
it and stuff the actual pin has just

161
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,320
come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and won't go back in so every</font>

162
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,270
now and again the camera will<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go</font>

163
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">bosch and like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fall on its front and</font>

164
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:01,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">that has just it's got to be bad for the</font>

165
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,570
lens so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought it's about time I</font>

166
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,280
picked up a new tripod this one was

167
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,910
actually so cheap it was thinking was 13

168
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,639
pounds which seems amazing because I was

169
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,289
unsure of what the quality<font color="#E5E5E5"> was gonna be</font>

170
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,090
like foot because i personally like my

171
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,710
tripod stays in a similar place the

172
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,240
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I'm not kind of taking it</font>

173
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,680
outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't need to be heavy duty</font>

174
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,780
it just needs to be like a standard for

175
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,520
my camera it doesn't you know have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

176
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,650
anything special<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

177
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,940
apprehensive about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the quality of this</font>

178
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,569
one but like at first

179
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:30,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">I obviously haven't used it yet but it</font>

180
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,649
seems pretty sturdy 413 pounds i thought

181
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:34,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was such a good bye and it has the</font>

182
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:36,639
kind of thing here and you can wind it

183
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,169
up and down do whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this which</font>

184
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:44,020
my last tripod didn't have so um I

185
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,759
thought that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really good bye I'll</font>

186
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,949
put links to everything in the nation

187
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,270
Pablo if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know exactly which</font>

188
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,800
ones I bought but I got only tripod and

189
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,039
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> very excited about that and next I</font>

190
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,749
got a couple of other kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of techy</font>

191
00:06:55,749 --> 00:07:00,689
things I got a new USB flash drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

192
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:05,229
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically because whenever i do</font>

193
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:07,360
any videos for anyone else like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

194
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,770
know if you guys know but i make videos

195
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,569
for the carmine website things like that

196
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:13,919
if I ever have to send them<font color="#E5E5E5"> the video</font>

197
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,969
because the internet isn't that fast

198
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,439
where I live it's sometimes easier just

199
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,059
to pop it on a USB stick and send it

200
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:21,399
overnight instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of uploading it</font>

201
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,689
because it saves them upload download

202
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:25,719
whatever and therefore I end up like

203
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:26,800
losing a lot of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm</font>

204
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,019
sending them to people but and this was

205
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:30,189
actually really good price i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it</font>

206
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:32,199
was eight pounds and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was going to buy</font>

207
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,809
a few of them because they're a lot more

208
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:36,369
expensive in the shops<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was going to</font>

209
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:37,689
buy a few of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> but i wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

210
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:39,399
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> how good a quality this one was</font>

211
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:42,069
before so yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought that was quite</font>

212
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:43,869
a good deal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also got this</font>

213
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:48,669
little case for my SD cards which I

214
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,649
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> II used to take pictures and</font>

215
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:52,389
films and stuff and it actually fits

216
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,659
eight I only have three at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment</font>

217
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:58,240
but it's definitely something that i

218
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,089
will use because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know if you</font>

219
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:02,469
guys know but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you buy an SD card</font>

220
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:04,719
they come with the like little plastic e

221
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:07,029
cases and i always seem to lose them I

222
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,529
just thought would be easier to have a

223
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,419
case where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep all my SD cards in</font>

224
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:12,219
at the same time when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I travel and</font>

225
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:13,809
they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get like bashed</font>

226
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:15,789
around a lot of the time I'll leave one

227
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:17,259
inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my laptop because I don't have</font>

228
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:18,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">a case for it but then it kind of sticks</font>

229
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,740
out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge so it's a little bit dodgy</font>

230
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i got bad i think this was</font>

231
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,789
about four or five pounds and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

232
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:26,889
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice quality actually its</font>

233
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:30,069
aluminium and feels really sturdy so

234
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:32,529
that's good and then finally you guys

235
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:34,630
are gonna laugh but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm on that</font>

236
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,510
health and fitness kick well finally I

237
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,078
bought a DVD and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jillian Michaels</font>

238
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:41,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">banish fat</font>

239
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,270
metabolism six-minute fixes basically

240
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to update you guys in a kind</font>

241
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">of health and fitness video which i'm</font>

242
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,700
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to upload i'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to record it</font>

243
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,839
after this video it will probably be

244
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,940
uploaded like a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of days from when</font>

245
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,260
this video goes up but I've been really

246
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,130
enjoying my<font color="#CCCCCC"> some DVD copy of a she a</font>

247
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,950
game it's on the week um I've been

248
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">really enjoying that I really like it</font>

249
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,000
but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think if you do things too often</font>

250
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">you kind of get bored of them so I was</font>

251
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for something new to try out and</font>

252
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,060
I get bored like doing a whole workout

253
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,890
TV that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like an hour long would bore</font>

254
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,170
me to tears and I would basically just

255
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,570
fail and stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it so I thought this</font>

256
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,430
sounds kind of good because it sounds

257
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,810
like it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bits of</font>

258
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,600
work out kind of blasts rather than and

259
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,790
like a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> hour and I get bored and</font>

260
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">never watch it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this was really</font>

261
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:33,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">cheap as well i think it was like</font>

262
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,070
reduced to five pounds or something and

263
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">i thought i might as well try it because</font>

264
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:38,649
I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good things about her</font>

265
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:41,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">DVDs I know her 30 day shred dvd was</font>

266
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,810
like um II thought like number one or

267
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:44,950
number two or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was</font>

268
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,120
tempted to try that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i thought i'll</font>

269
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,100
transfer first and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll see how it</font>
