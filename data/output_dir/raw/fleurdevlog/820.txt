00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
hi everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> posted a blog</font>

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,170
video in like two weeks and I feel so

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,250
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> because when I started this channel</font>

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,370
I really wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be uploading at least</font>

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,110
one video a week but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just got so busy</font>

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,900
recently as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tell I've been ill</font>

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,580
as well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of hasn't helped</font>

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,100
and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been trying to kind of post</font>

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,570
videos on my puter channel as a priority

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,140
to hear um because obviously that's my

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">main channel um but i'm back with a</font>

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">share the love video I thought I would</font>

13
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">do a shell on a video on this channel</font>

14
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,760
because even though a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are</font>

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,740
beauty related there's also some non

16
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,850
beauty related things in there as well

17
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,210
so I thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would kind of include it</font>

18
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,370
with a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of update videos well I'm</font>

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,780
Yorkers or if you've lived in New York

60
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,790

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,940

68
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,620
liked

69
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,200
touristy things I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of know about</font>

70
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,519
what if there's anything I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

71
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:18,780
everybody knows about the main touristy

72
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,980
things in Europe because New York such a

73
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,299
famous city bit there's anything that's

74
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:23,310
kind of off the beaten track that you

75
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,780
guys can recommend I'll be amazing

76
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,819
because obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're there for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a week</font>

77
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,230
so it's quite a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and I think</font>

78
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll have quite a lot of time to do</font>

79
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:31,860
some good<font color="#E5E5E5"> shopping and kind of see a few</font>

80
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,019
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> normally</font>

81
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:35,459
see when you're in New York so go a

82
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit further afield as well I hope</font>

83
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,930
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope yeah so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the share the love</font>

84
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,629
actual content of the video<font color="#CCCCCC"> here I mean</font>

85
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,430
me nice to share the love for a long

86
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,750
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I kind of just haven't really</font>

87
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,340
got around to it and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

88
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">people on YouTube</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've been</font>

89
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,799
watching and also blogs I've been

90
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:52,319
reading as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well beauty related and I'm</font>

91
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,609
abuse-related that I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell you</font>

92
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:55,650
guys about and I kind of have a list

93
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,569
there in no particular order really<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

94
00:02:57,569 --> 00:02:58,709
i'll start with beauty related just

95
00:02:58,709 --> 00:02:59,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that's kind of top on my list</font>

96
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,579
the first one is a model recommends or

97
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:06,180
Ruth and she makes videos on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube and</font>

98
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,190
has a blog and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I honestly don't</font>

99
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,040
understand how<font color="#E5E5E5"> she doesn't have like</font>

100
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,480
five times the amount of subscribers

101
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,159
that she has on youtube because I find

102
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">her so funny and she's basically a</font>

103
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,440
professional model and has been feel

104
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">like years and years ago so she's</font>

105
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:22,049
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> really knowledgeable about all</font>

106
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:23,099
things beauty of see she's getting

107
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,190
makeup put on her all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time um and</font>

108
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,359
things like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's just really</font>

109
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:30,000
witty um and she smacks me laugh so

110
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,470
whenever<font color="#CCCCCC"> she uploads video I always kind</font>

111
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">of gravitate towards them and watch</font>

112
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,639
those so um a model recommends i

definitely recommend that's weird i

114
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,629
recommend the model recommends if you
