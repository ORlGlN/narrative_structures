41
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,460
personally two of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good friends</font>

42
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,869
have actually made it through the first

43
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,450
one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jimmy Baba or Jim you might know</font>

44
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,790
him as pixie to woo or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tanya buzz</font>

45
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,890
boyfriends on YouTube and he makes male

46
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,020
grooming videos and I think even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font>

47
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,430
they're male grooming a lot of girls

48
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,680
watch his channel as well because he's

49
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,030
just really interesting to watch he's

50
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,380
really great<font color="#E5E5E5"> in front of the camera</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

51
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,270
he gives good product reviews<font color="#CCCCCC"> and things</font>

52
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,759
like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jim is the first one who</font>

53
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,110
I'm really rooting for and the second

54
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,670
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Gemma or gems maquillage who is</font>

55

also a beauty girl here on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube and</font>

56
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,689

58
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,810
