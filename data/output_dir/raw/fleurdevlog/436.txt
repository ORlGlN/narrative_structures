00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,569
packing wise<font color="#E5E5E5"> I basically at the moment</font>

64
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:28,220

with me video and which to be honest

70
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:40,640
it's probably better than this because

71
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,870
it doesn't have the pile of clothes on

72
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the floor but um this place ooh I</font>

74
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,849
really well it is from boohoo and my

75
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:51,340
necklace is also from boohoo actually

76
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,840
funnily enough which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is weird because</font>

77
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,790
normally i'm gonna wear<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mixture of</font>

78
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,200
stuff and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have tights on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:04,459
outfit of the day and obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>
