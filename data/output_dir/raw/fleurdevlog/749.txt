00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,310
morning so I think it's catching up with

83
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,930
me because I'm one of those people like

84
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,760
some people will be like oh that's quite

85
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,190
obviously I need a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lotta sleep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm</font>

86
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,300
