156
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,450
realize it's really hard in France

157

because<font color="#CCCCCC"> he lives in France were on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

158
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,169
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult right I was</font>

159
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,550
explaining to fly like I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

160
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,650
restaurant my family came to visit it

161
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,990

162
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,510
meal<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I just asked them is that any</font>

00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,320
anything and they like no and the chef

165
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,590
would rather like turn party away then

166
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,970
cook something that you didn't want to

167
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,190
make well that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just so it's a</font>

168
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,530
challenge yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how this is easy</font>

169
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">access like there's bit more it doesn't</font>

170
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,850
bigger as well yeah so we're gonna try

171
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,680
and find somewhere that does something

172
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,120
tasty for Gemma cuz we don't want to go

173
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,400
we don't want her to go without tasty

174
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,190
food obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm all right I'm Ali</font>

well they're far are they in Paris has

176
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,360
been really fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I feel ragazze if I</font>

177
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,520
can show you guys more in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> L'Oreal</font>

178
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,350
research labs because it was actually

179
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,820
kind of confidential we had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put on</font>

180
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,420
these like plastic lab coat and I kid

181
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,980
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought I was going to faint</font>

182
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,590
at one point because it was kind of warm

183
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,300
in there and because we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> wearing</font>

184
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,920
this plastic lab coats over the top for

185
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,260
clothes it was like sweat central log

186
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,020
flume on the log flume on towers if

187
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,770
anyone knows what we mean then thumbs up

188
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,940
but it would they weren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

189
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,200
attractive but I didn't write about that

190
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,190
but the fact that I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hot and I</font>

191
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,680
I've got quite strong disposition if

192
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,820
that makes sense that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font>

193
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't Lee said sure yeah yeah um</font>

194
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,020
rather than a weakness position like I

195
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,840
don't really get faint very often and I

196
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,890
honestly<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to faint</font>

197
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:31,910
and it was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be really</font>

198
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,160
embarrassing whilst this head scientist

199
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,620
was telling us about<font color="#CCCCCC"> L'Oreal's research</font>

200
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,860
into hair<font color="#CCCCCC"> color ins and um it could have</font>

201
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,720
been really<font color="#E5E5E5"> embarrassing but it wasn't</font>

202
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was ok this fine got what if we got</font>

203
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,830
water and we we were all right but I

204
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,970
wish we could phone a bit more but it

205
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,970
was kind of um you weren't allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

206
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,740
film and they told you there was certain

207
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,940
spots that you'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a picture</font>

208
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">and there I couldn't do anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

209
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,430
it's there like research place my guess

210
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">I guess i'll see ya the machines they</font>

211
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">used a kind of cutting edge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there yeah</font>

212
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">loreal are the only people that got a</font>

213
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,560
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that those kinds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of yeah and it</font>

214
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,970
was you know what it was actually so

215
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,040
interesting as well because I mean of

216
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,930
all opportunities like YouTube has given

217
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,810
me and general obviously like asks a lot

218
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,000
of opportunities in general I think to

219
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,160
go and see the the behind-the-scenes

220
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,510
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of everything that goes into</font>

221
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,060
creating a product is very very

222
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,620
fascinating we got to ask a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

223
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,560
questions that<font color="#CCCCCC"> um and maybe we should</font>

224
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,920
move on my mind

225
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,300
as well because that's something that I

226
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that's like a whole nother video</font>

227
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,409
because I know like I'm gonna mention it

228
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:37,200
now and like grief obviously it is a

229
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,450
huge huge topic but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue of animal</font>

230
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,169
testing if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are sensitive to and I'm</font>

231
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">edgy tonight yeah I mean that I think</font>

232
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">about a lot like I take it very</font>

233
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,510
seriously and I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

234
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,910
investigate but<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I had a few tweets</font>

235
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,320
today just from saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> other going to</font>

236
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,760
lauriol dislike this stigma that your

237
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,410
tests on animals and we had a massive

238
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,110
in-depth discussion with the head of

239
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,790
communications for l'oreal yeah what

240
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,460
does exactly what so it was it was

241
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,140
really interesting basically to learn

242
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,390
more and to<font color="#CCCCCC"> otis not just black and</font>

243
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,970
white<font color="#CCCCCC"> eyes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah ingredients and the laws</font>

244
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,220
of different yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean we're not</font>

245
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,180
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into it in this vlog</font>

246
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,220
because it's like what nine o'clock at

250
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,380
just it to cut it short it was

251
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,710
fascinating to see that yeah and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

252
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and say look my followers think</font>

253
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,250
