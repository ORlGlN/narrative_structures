00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,920
be more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the actual exam itself and</font>

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,420
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the process of taking exams</font>

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,550
rather than the revision side of things

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,050
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to jump right into it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font>

10
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,020
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> five questions the first one is from</font>

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,050
Emmy or cyber<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sparrow on Twitter and she</font>

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,060
says do you find cramming right before

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,949
an exam helped or impeded your

14
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,520
performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the exam personally I'm a</font>

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,739
really quite organized person when it

16
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,270
comes to exams so I've never liked

17
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,230
crammed for an exam and not done any

18
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,260
like long-standing revision before um if

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,059
you guys are watching from outside the

20
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,680
UK there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a difference in the</font>

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,680
school system pretty much the whole of

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">our grades that go on to our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CV for like</font>

23
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,930
the rest of our lives<font color="#E5E5E5"> are from exams</font>

24
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,430
like there's a certain portion course

25
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,620
work but we don't get graded in terms of

26
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,059
our performance in class throughout the

27
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,440
year what like we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a grade</font>

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,539
point average like you do in the States

29
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,580
or I'm not sure how everyone in the

30
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,380
world school system works but in the UK

31
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,470
is very very exam based so I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

32
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,000
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were in the States</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you might be</font>

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,200
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get away with climbing a little</font>

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,720
bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the exams aren't quite</font>

35
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,420
as important they don't like have as

36
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,710
much weight as<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do in England but</font>

37
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,759
for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know that i would rather kind</font>

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,330
of if i'm gonna slack it wouldn't be

39
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,799
during revision time like it would be

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,630
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> term time and then i have like a</font>

41
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,729
month or<font color="#E5E5E5"> three weeks before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the exam</font>

42
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,060
where I really really study hard so yeah

43
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,720
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really crammed having said that</font>

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,329
I do revised right up to the last minute

45
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,460
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the night before the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exam I usually I</font>

46
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,869
used to have like flash cards and I

47
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,280
would go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through all the flash cars like</font>

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,079
the main points and just kind of make

49
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,000
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> I knew them and the thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,619
you're cramming like the light<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I</font>

51
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,689
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like not much of it goes in because</font>

52
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,250
you're kind of in a bit of a panic<font color="#E5E5E5"> state</font>

53
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,380
so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I these learners I need to learn</font>

54
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and the more you kind of try and</font>

55
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">force your brain to remember something I</font>

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,390
feel like it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work as well it's</font>

57
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,920
more about kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> building knowledge</font>

58
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,560
but like as a whole that you kind of

59
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,720
hold<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

60
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,419
don't recall

61
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,530
instantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of at the back of</font>

62
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">your mind so if you're writing say an</font>

63
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,890
extended answer to a question or an

64
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,780
essay you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> write a point and then</font>

65
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,310
another point will come to you being

66
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,870
only I remember he said that because

67
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,620
you've actually done like a work over a

68
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,239
long period of time rather than trying

69
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:26,940
to remember points at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last minute so</font>

70
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,950
cramming has a place<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely for like</font>

71
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,780
less important tests I definitely

72
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,280
crammed and didn't revised like a week

73
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">before but it's not the way to go guys</font>

74
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,739
it's not the way to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay number two</font>

75
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:40,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nancy don't concern from facebook asks</font>

76
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:43,269
can you talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to overcome test</font>

77
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:46,209
anxiety and fatigue during the exam I

78
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:48,010
have a four hour standardized exam for

79
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,290
grad school that I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking in june for</font>

80
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,480
the fourth time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know the material</font>

81
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,640
but it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus for hours at high</font>

82
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,980
intensity when they videotape you in the

83
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,600
exam to prevent cheating<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm actually</font>

84
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,519
that was a long questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> oregon I've</font>

85
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:02,019
actually never had<font color="#E5E5E5"> them videotape an</font>

86
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:04,180
exam I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think but I have had very</font>

87
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">very long exams i don't think i've had a</font>

88
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,569
four-hour One I think my longest at

89
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:09,549
university was three and a half hours

90
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:11,440
and it is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to stay</font>

91
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">focused cuz it's such a long exam like</font>

92
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,329
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a half hours or four hours is</font>

93
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,920
a long time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be concentrating on the</font>

94
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">same thing and not have like a break and</font>

95
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,430
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside and get some fresh air or</font>

96
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,010
whatever the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I finds make</font>

97
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,450
sure you have water with you I know

98
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,850
that's like a really obvious thing for

99
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,950
long exams taking a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottle of water if</font>

100
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,170
you think we need a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy</font>

101
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,120
maybe take<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a juice or something if</font>

102
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,590
you can I know different exams<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

103
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,609
different guidelines of what you can

104
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:38,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">have in clear bottles but pretty much</font>

105
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:39,250
they'll let you take in juice if you

106
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">take the label off and all of us so I</font>

107
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,620
find that really helps if you need kind

108
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,600
of a boost of energy definitely take

109
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,430
snacks so I used to take in like boiled

110
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,660
sweets because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can kind of suck on</font>

111
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,310
them they last for like maybe five

112
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,049
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> or so rather than if you take</font>

113
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,180
like a whole bag<font color="#CCCCCC"> of chewy sweets and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

114
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,380
just eat them all then you're going to

115
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,790
be on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a massive sugar high and it's</font>

116
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably not great but I found boiled</font>

117
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,700
sweets are quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> good because you can</font>

118
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,829
kind of like they take a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> to eat</font>

119
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:10,060
them you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to eat like five</font>

120
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,980
in a minute and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a sugar high</font>

121
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,250
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then again a sugar low so I find</font>

122
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,019
things like boiled sweets take nuts if

123
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">you like nuts and things like that</font>

124
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,779
they're always good for kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeping</font>

125
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:22,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">up energy over a period of time</font>

126
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,860
and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of anxiety the same thing I</font>

127
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,680
said in part 1 of this video I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think try</font>

128
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,360
and just calm yourself down take a step

129
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">back if you have a real panic over a</font>

130
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,139
question just<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a step</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back I find a</font>

131
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,970
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time with the long exams if</font>

132
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:41,250
you're writing essays um I think it's

133
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,620
good sometimes if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from my</font>

134
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,879
personal experience anyway if I'm

135
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,259
writing an essay and sometimes I think

136
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,180
oh this isn't quite going<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

137
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,220
direction that I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to take a</font>

138
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,080
step back go and look<font color="#E5E5E5"> back at your plan</font>

139
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,669
for your essay which you should have

140
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,409
made if you don't plan for essays in

141
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:57,419
exams i would highly recommend that<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

142
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,460
back to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan and like take a look</font>

143
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,900
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again and see where you're wanting</font>

144
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,430
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can kind of readjust the</font>

145
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,560
direction if you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to panic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font>

146
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,430
a thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

147
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,080
wrong thing you can always<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of steer</font>

148
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,759
things back to the way that you wanted

149
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">them to be yeah and that's pretty much</font>

150
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:12,960
it for my tips for long exams<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

151
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,150
you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of like take a minute</font>

152
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,710
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start panicking just shut your</font>

153
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,580
eyes and take a breath<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

154
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">to it that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like my main tip for</font>

155
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,360
anything about anxiety is just try and

156
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,099
relax<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it rather than</font>

157
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:28,650
like panic panic panic and like trying

158
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,120
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add more things in I think it's just</font>

159
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,550
take a deep breath shut your eyes and

160
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,030
try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> relax and drink a bit of water</font>

161
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,400
number three Joanna Harding from twitter

162
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,580
asks how not to get distracted and when

163
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in exams this is my number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one tip</font>

164
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:45,650
if you get easily distracted take

165
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,930
earplugs number one thing every single

166
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,690
exam as soon as they said you may start

167
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,729
to like open the paper start writing

168
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,529
whatever they say beginning the exams I

169
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:58,050
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put my ear plugs in and go and</font>

170
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,389
then you even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though you can't really</font>

171
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:02,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">hear like it is a bit strange because in</font>

172
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,319
a way you kind of aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> people around</font>

173
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,849
you but you can't hear them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me</font>

174
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:08,460
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number one best thing to stop</font>

175
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,469
being distracted and exams because I am

176
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:13,289
so distracted<font color="#E5E5E5"> by people like tapping</font>

177
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:17,159
their feet or like breathing heavily or

178
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:20,460
like shuffling I just I can't stand it

179
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,819
and it really puts<font color="#E5E5E5"> me off number four um</font>

180
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:28,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Santos</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mihari asks um if you what</font>

181
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,990
do you do if you forget an answer do you

182
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,120
leave it blank or do you just guess this

183
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,650
is like such an easy question<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

184
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,199
because there's no way in<font color="#E5E5E5"> any scenario</font>

185
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,669
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would leave a question life</font>

186
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:41,320
because at the end of the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

187
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,810
you're never<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get marks for a</font>

188
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,419
blank on so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't physically</font>

189
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:47,710
get any marks if you don't write

190
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,660
anything but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you write just like</font>

191
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,430
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know about that general</font>

192
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,590
topic if you don't have a clue like what

193
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're asking for and you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just right</font>

194
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,400
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what you know the chances are</font>

195
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,389
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to get like one or two</font>

196
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:01,210
marks for it because if you know things

197
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> links within the answer</font>

198
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,229
then it's got to be there somewhere so

199
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:07,570
for example I remember in my physics a

200
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,220
level exam there was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> question that I</font>

201
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,789
just did not have any idea how to come

202
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:14,470
to the answer so I just wrote down<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

203
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,110
every equation that I knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was to</font>

204
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,180
do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that topic and kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

205
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,120
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come to a conclusion and like</font>

206
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,729
it was basically wrong but I'm pretty

207
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:26,110
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got one mark for that because I</font>

208
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,289
had the right kind of idea there but you

209
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:31,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that it's always worth putting</font>

210
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,070
something even if you have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea just</font>

211
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,570
make something up because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might go</font>

212
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,919
to mark it's better than just<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaving it</font>

213
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,360
blank and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably have the time</font>

214
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,770
to write anyway because they'll allocate

215
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,599
the time for the exam so you may as well

216
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:42,639
don't miss out on marks that you might

217
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">be able to cheat your way into like by</font>

218
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,590
writing something random okay number

219
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:51,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ali</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> malaysia asks how are exams at</font>

220
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,979
uni different than before and I touched

221
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:56,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">on this briefly in part 1 of this video</font>

222
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,630
as well from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my personal experience at</font>

223
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">least I found that University exams are</font>

224
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,909
very much more based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on knowledge and</font>

225
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:05,860
like a deeper level of knowledge so a

226
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,360
lot of it is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've read what</font>

227
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,419
you've read outside of the reading list

228
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:15,550
kind of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can link your thinking</font>

229
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,260
back to other people this was something

230
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,330
that took me a while to learn when I was

231
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,010
at uni as that you never thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

232
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,050
anything for us like at school you can

233
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,580
seem to just write I think this because

234
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,590
this and in your exams and you can kind

235
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">of come to own conclusions you don't</font>

236
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,220
have to reference anybody where is that

237
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,810
you need the main difference is the fact

238
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,690
that every like academic point that you

239
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,969
make you have to reference like where

240
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:38,650
that came from or like wave that not

241
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,479
from and that's the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that it</font>

242
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,339
took me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> while to get used to that uni</font>

243
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:45,250
the reading and then referencing the

244
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,240
points that you've learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

245
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,730
readings I like it it's

246
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,410
different style of learning but it's

247
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,860
definitely like once you've cracked how

248
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,019
to do it it becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite easy because</font>

249
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,620
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you almost think point reference</font>

250
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,329
point reference rather than just writing

251
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:02,519
kind of free hand like he was when

252
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,350
you're doing your a levels and GCSEs so

253
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,790
there's a different different but

254
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,430
there's definitely a difference there

255
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm in terms of the learning like it's</font>

256
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,010
it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more independent so it's a</font>

257
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,899
lot more independent reading I think

258
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,149
once you leave school<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start uni you</font>

259
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:20,160
realize how much your spoon fed at

260
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,940
school to know like the exact like

261
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,810
curriculum that you're meant to know and

262
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't really learn much outside that</font>

263
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,529
at all where<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it you you're kind of</font>

264
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:30,990
actively encouraged<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just go on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

265
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,820
own and kind of learn different things

266
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,470
that you're interested in surrounding

267
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,610
the subject and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a lot more</font>

268
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,079
marks for that exams at uni apart from

269
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they're pretty similar um in terms</font>

270
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,800
of the whole exam format there's nothing

271
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,470
different for me at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> my uni exams</font>

272
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,180
were a much smaller environment so there

273
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,649
were rooms with say<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50 people then</font>

274
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:55,290
whereas my school exams had like 150

275
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,910
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in them so they're a little bit</font>

276
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,519
less intimidating like that like the

277
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,410
size of the room is much smaller so

278
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,720
they're not as kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of scary but in</font>

279
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,800
terms of the format they're pretty

280
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,120
similar like there may be a bit longer

281
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">depending on what course you do but</font>

282
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:10,350
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much the difference there</font>

283
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,540
yeah so I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> helps some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

284
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,190
guys who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing exams at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment</font>

285
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,069
i'll have exams coming up<font color="#CCCCCC"> i really wish</font>

286
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:18,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">you all the best of luck if you have</font>

287
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,069
exams coming up<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz i know it is a</font>

288
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:22,110
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> nerve-wracking time and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm so</font>

289
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,300
glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i'm not in that environment</font>

290
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,339
anymore<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to do exams because</font>

291
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,709
it's such a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stress but always</font>

292
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:30,660
keep in mind the feeling of when you

293
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,250
finish your last exam and you have the

294
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,019
whole summer ahead of you that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also</font>

295
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">the best feeling in the whole world like</font>

296
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing compares to that feeling of like</font>

297
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,949
it's summer yeah and I wish I could go

298
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:43,050
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> having that like the end of hard</font>

299
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,760
work in the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of summer so I</font>

300
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,920
don't know what that random tangent was

301
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,120
