3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,639
anything too exciting I've been just at

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,170
my house all day kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of making videos</font>

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,480
editing videos uploading videos so i

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,719
hope you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys enjoyed my nail tutorial</font>

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,600
wolf is trying to eat the cat Wolfie

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,680
don't bite um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I've just been at</font>

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,689
home doing videos I think Mike's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

10
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:25,890
been on a bike ride and he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just got</font>

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,689
back that's why woofs like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just love</font>

12
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,579
with you so much look at me she's so

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,590
cute anyway so I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just been catching</font>

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,899
up with emails and all that jazz but I

15
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,510
thought I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you a quick update</font>

16
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,910
on my p.o box situation now I never

17
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,350
really thought that I would need a p.o

18
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,710
box that people would actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

19
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,700
write to me or send me things or

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,770
anything like that but I have had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

21
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">of requests and even more so recently to</font>

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,699
let you guys know if I have a p.o box

23
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,000
and if I do what is the address so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,739
don't actually have a p.o box the reason

25
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,750
being in the UK<font color="#E5E5E5"> pierre boxes aren't</font>

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,030
actually very secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> because when you</font>

27
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,379
register for a p.o box<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think your</font>

28
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,000
address actually goes link to the pier

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,560
box if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look online in a database</font>

30
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,880
apparently you can find the address

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,610
anyway so it's not really a very secure

32
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,939
way of putting my address like publicly

33
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,530
I don't think anything that's a great

34
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,680
idea anyway but I've managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to arrange</font>

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,110
a p.o box situation with my network so I

36
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,060
now have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mailing address that you guys</font>

37
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,979
can send to i'm going to put all of the

38
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,250

39
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,549
