month and as March isn't one of the

00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,039
vlogging everyday months I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

21
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,300
would ask you guys what you would like

22

<font color="#CCCCCC">to see so you guys have any like</font>

23
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,060
anything I can try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make like one else</font>

24
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,479
hang on the series of my experience or

25
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,719
benighted uni and I did my gap here and

26
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:20,649
things like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything like that</font>

27
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:22,840
that you'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see or just anything</font>

at all really any requests would be

29
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,360
awesome and i thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would also just</font>

30
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,979
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've been getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of sorry</font>

31
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,090
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a beautiful day those kind</font>

32
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like spring for the first time ever</font>

33
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,360
and I'm a little bit out of breath this

34
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,069
is another thing I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit our</font>

35
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:41,469
breath because I'm massively unfit so I

36
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:44,289
have to having like a break and getting

37
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:46,569
you know feeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> much better and</font>

38
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:48,580
healthier I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

39
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:53,649
fitness and<font color="#E5E5E5"> health kick um now like</font>

40
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:56,289
today and carrying on forward into the

41
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:58,119
future because basically and I get a lot

42
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">of questions actually about what I do</font>

43
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,950
for fitness and how to stay in<font color="#CCCCCC"> shape and</font>

44
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,649
stuff my answer to that is absolutely

45
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:08,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing I don't do any exercise which is</font>

46
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,840
atrocious like and I really should I'm

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,000
quite lucky that I'm naturally fairly

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,829
slim so I haven't had to kind of do it

49
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,660
from that perspective but from a health

50
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,970
perspective and generally being fit I

51
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,620
want to start living a bit more

52
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">healthfully as well because I don't eat</font>

53
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,859
very helpfully either so I'm gonna take

54
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:28,239
you guys on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of journey with me</font>

56
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:32,230
the actual exercise our<font color="#E5E5E5"> breath walking</font>

57
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,489
like that's how bad this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be</font>

58
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:35,609
