00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,830
and so they knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I delivered</font>

174
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,300
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they would need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suction out her</font>

201
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering where he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was and why he wasn't</font>

202
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">there and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> knew because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we kind of</font>

203
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,810
knew him personally that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

210
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,350
didn't know any better<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

211
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would have been a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vocal</font>

212
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,160
because but I just didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know any</font>

213
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,990
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I really was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happy that my mom</font>

214
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,540
was advocating for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and Joel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

215
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,050
we didn't know and the nurse told<font color="#CCCCCC"> us we</font>

216
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,720
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once you get to attend we</font>

217
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,000
like the baby to rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and descend for an</font>

218
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,620
hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no I am NOT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to rest and</font>

219
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,410
descend<font color="#E5E5E5"> for an hour when my baby is</font>

220
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">under stress and I have been in labor</font>

221
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,930
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifteen hours like no that's not</font>

222
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening and so we were pretty upset</font>

223
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> took an hour I pushed for one</font>

224
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,090
hour so I start like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think another</font>

225
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:29,680
nurse had me start pushing and it took

226
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,050
me one full<font color="#E5E5E5"> hour of pushing before</font>

227
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">Olivia was born and I remember we'd been</font>

228
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,170
asking for the doctor for<font color="#CCCCCC"> about two</font>

229
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,590
hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he walked in as the head was</font>

230
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:45,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming out and he didn't even like wash</font>

231
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">his hands or anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he came in he</font>

232
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">threw on some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gloves he didn't even have</font>

233
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">a gown on he literally ran in the room</font>

234
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">put his gloves on and caught the baby</font>

235
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it really makes me upset to this day</font>

236
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,010
kind of because every appointment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

237
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,540
had with him<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> told</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

238
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,610
want to tear<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want to tear I</font>

239
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,320
would rather be<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut you know have an</font>

240
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,530
episiotomy<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I would like if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

241
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">because you know you hear some doctors</font>

242
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,220
do the massaging<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they help stretch</font>

243
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,970
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you don't tear well I had a</font>

244
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,820
third-degree tear and it was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

245
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,610
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the way to my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bum hole and I</font>

246
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,110
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a little graphic but it's</font>

247
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,680
true<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it was it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was nasty it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was bad</font>

248
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so when Olivia was born she was born</font>

249
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,730
at 8:01 a.m. she<font color="#CCCCCC"> was 6 pounds 14 ounces</font>

250
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,260
and 19<font color="#CCCCCC"> inches long and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happy</font>

251
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,990
once that once<font color="#CCCCCC"> she was here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

252
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,880
doctor was<font color="#E5E5E5"> stitching me up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font>

253
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,640
never gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> the baby right to me which I</font>

254
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,000
knew that they needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go suction her</font>

255
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">but I didn't know what was going on</font>

256
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">until the next morning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when my mom told</font>

257
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

258
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,850
but they took Olivia

259
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,890
and they had to stick a tube<font color="#CCCCCC"> down her</font>

260
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,170
throat and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they suctioned out her lungs</font>

261
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,850
and they had to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

262
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,060
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they couldn't get her heart</font>

263
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,710
rate up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> parents and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jill's</font>

264
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,960
parents were out in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hall and I guess</font>

265
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mother-in-law said that once they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

266
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,550
suctioned her lungs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they couldn't</font>

267
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,350
quite get her breathing quite right they

268
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,910
couldn't get her heart rate up<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

269
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,100
paged the respiratory nurse and she came

270
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,170
bailing down the hall throwing gloves on

271
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,240
as she was<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming down and they were</font>

272
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,600
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on her and they they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did end up</font>

273
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">giving her her heart rate back up which</font>

274
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,530
was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good and she</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was raspy for</font>

275
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,090
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of days but she was just</font>

276
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:46,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">fine and the rest of the hospital stay</font>

277
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">was really great</font>

278
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,960
I didn't nurse very well with Olivia<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

279
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">nursed her for about four months and</font>

280
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,940
like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said I didn't know any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better the</font>

281
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">nurse gave me a shield</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use and settle</font>

282
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,160
this will help and I wish I<font color="#CCCCCC"> never would</font>

283
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been introduced to the shield</font>

284
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I could have nursed</font>

285
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,190
her longer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> better if I didn't have</font>

286
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we just enjoyed our hospital stay</font>

287
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,200
together as a family<font color="#CCCCCC"> Joel stayed with me</font>

288
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,720
through the nights<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> loved the</font>

289
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,310
hospital some people hate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

290
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,110
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but we just really</font>

291
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">enjoyed being there we watch movies we</font>

292
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,880
just take naps<font color="#E5E5E5"> together and I don't know</font>
