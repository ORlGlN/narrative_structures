<font color="#E5E5E5">practice where there was a during</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

114
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,639
week or after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weekend once</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font>

115
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,340
walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bonnie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> across sandwich park at</font>

116
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,530
least until<font color="#CCCCCC"> our paths had to part ways</font>

117
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,949
but that walk takes two minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font>

118
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:49,699
made<font color="#CCCCCC"> it last</font>

119
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:53,120
I bet it took us an hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop yeah</font>

120
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,010
we'd walk across and then we'd stand

121
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,620
there and we'd watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cars go by and</font>

122
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,360
then he'd walk his<font color="#CCCCCC"> way and I'd walk my</font>

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,479
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> any time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went to any meetups we</font>

time like those were really<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun times</font>

126
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,270
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's really where we got to know</font>
