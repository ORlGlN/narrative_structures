Twitter
the real grumpy cat is he followed me on
Twitter the real grumpy cat followed me
on Twitter how freaking cool is that I'm
freaking out hope she's gonna be at
playlist
yeah maybe let me so go okay we're gonna
play some game now look he's up from his
nap huh so cute I am done playing my
game I was very much procrastinating
when I was playing that video game I am
trying to not stressed out so I'm
wearing my Tiger outfit so that I stay
relaxed I am packing right now so I've
got all my outfits laid out I'm trying
to kind of be organized when I pack
because sometimes I really have a
tendency of over packing all the time so
I'm trying really hard not to over pack
so I've got like six different pants
I've got about eight different sweaters
I've got my jacket scarfs I've got some
leggings here in case I want to like
pair them with something I've got my
party dresses cuz we will be going to a
couple parties a Papa and I still just
need to get like my undergarments and um
night clothes stuff like that so I'm
feeling like I'm doing pretty good so
far I might still be a tad over packing
especially with all these scarves dude
does one person need this many scarves
probably not so I'm going to try
and pair them up with outfit so that way
I'm not bringing all the scars but at
the same time you never know what kind
of scarf you're gonna be wanting to wear
that day favorite things I got while
shopping was this really really pretty
Hardy dress and it's cool cuz it's black
and it's long-sleeve so it's a tad
warmer obviously it's not going to be
super warm but I will be inside anyway
so it shouldn't be a big deal to try and
get as much packing done now and then
I'm going to take this doggy to the
doggie Park so he can play for a little
bit huh you want to go play go play all
you want to go play too I guess
past brien thought it'd be hilarious if
I put all our suitcases up here cuz we
don't use them that much come on pass

staying here with Oliver we really
wanted to take him but at the same time
we were like this play this is going to
be a little bit smaller a little more
low-key and it might be a good idea for
Missy and I just to sort of enjoy each
other's company I mean I mean that is
honestly it is really nice right about a
little like time but no I really wish we
could have brought him but I really your
Jail
we have to have someone with us yeah
it's like unless we're willing to
you someone because to be honest he
probably can't stay at the meetups the
whole time so someone else to take him

leave or something so this way we get to
actually meet you guys who's paying to
go to the event without having to leave
