I don't know if it's because Oliver had
such a fun day yesterday or if he truly
is just one going on 15 but Oliver slept
for 15 hours last night 15 hours how is
that even possible bro he's like a true
Hollister Lanning because we love our
sleep I could not believe it it was
11:00 a.m. he finally woke up and he
ended up falling asleep around 8 a.m.
less or 8 p.m. yesterday he was
definitely pooped yeah I was up till 4
a.m. editing yesterday's vlog if you
guys didn't see it the waterpark vlog I
tried to make it extra special so go
check it out
so I was up super late and I was asleep
at 4 a.m. and I actually woke up before
everyone else especially for this kid
he's so happy with himself what
don't push me oh you see the bestest
bestest the bestest all right guys I got
the whole car loaded up
I got softboxes camera equipment a
couple more things to add to the filming
studio because that's where I am headed
this is cousin Jeffrey and I have
basically designed our own little space
in his house which isn't too far from
where we lived the place where we can
record music and film covers and have
everything like available to us and
accessible to make it really really easy
for us I got something super exciting in
the mail today and I couldn't even help
myself so I brought it and it's in the
car and we're gonna open it up at his
house - hey Olli who do you have her do
you have left you have buzz he's been
talking about buzz all morning and I
actually had a midwife appointment today
which I'm really looking forward to
haven't seen her in so long we kind of
were like oh we can go six months or six
weeks between my appointments but
because I was doing an Anatomy scan but
then like all this stuff happened and
now I'm like eight weeks out for my last
appointment but that's okay cuz really
you just go there and like check the
heartbeat and talk them it's not really
a big deal but I'm gonna I'm actually
going to mop real quick and I've been
using this mop for a few months now and
I still love it like I just think that
it does such a good job cleaning cuz
it's a steamer so it like I feel like it
really sanitizes the floor my floors are
not looking too good you probably can't
tell but they're not looking great Jim
this is how mommy cleans the floor huh
so I've got I moved everything over and
Bryant actually off he's getting some
stuff done with our cousin for like some
new covers for his channel so I'm
mopping with a baby that's always fun
huh all right guys my new toy came Evan

poppin people you might not want to step
forward though cuz
yeah actually yeah Papa really love the
lights too oh we're all right I just got
out of my midwife appointment which was
great it was kind of a boring
appointment but I do have to set up a
glucose test which oh I don't like drink
Lucas it's so gross but I'll probably
set that up soon but I was really funny
cuz she was like all right before you
leave go um I want you to do like a
urine sample and so when we were leaving
I was like we've been where am I
supposed to do that I don't know I said
well we'll figure that out after I go
the bath Kyrie let's go pee and of
course I went B and then I was like wait
is that yeah I was supposed to do a
urine thing and that I have to pee so
that's kind of funny
I felt so dumb like I literally walked
out of the bathroom and looked at my mom
and she was like what the heck why'd you
go pee I like fighting yelling is that
Dobby but we just both weren't really
thinking so that's okay we can just do
it when I do my glucose
you hear it a lot more so we are in our
filming room getting ready to film a
cover for you guys just setting
everything up for the first time getting
everything miked and adjusted properly
so it all sounds good but I'm excited we
found this Cajon it's got these really
cool symbols on the front I think it
adds a really cool sound to the song I
just picked up Brian and um he was he
was at his cousins and being babysat all
day I feel like I dropped you off that's
the babysitters and I just picked you up
it was so fun we got so much done I'm so
excited
it did sound really good got an T in the
back and an T actually a little spiel a
little just a little spill she was
trying out the new scooter and she got
it up really fast she actually was
snapchatting at the same time and it
said like 7 miles per hour which I
believe which but I swear it was
probably going faster it was going
really good the scooter actually went
right into the grass but she fell back
hard hit her head she didn't even get up
for it for a minute or so like it was it
was pretty bad I was kind of scared she
was ok should blackout or anything and
she might have heard her read why you
gotta be careful even on those things I
think outside
I fell I hit my back and in my head and
I think like trying to like get my fall
and it's my wrist so cool right
it was really cool so cool it is the
coolest thing ever simply best money
I've ever spent
so I love it so I wish I could ride it
you're not at my mom and dads and she
may be strong enough and I was like yes
that's what I want
so now reading beef stroganoff here and
I think I want to bite so I think I'm
gonna go get a bite this is what he's
been doing
oh my god so you're walking now I'm
gonna make some corn in the copy and
tyonne drive this thing in target yeah
see why not they may not allow it
remember when we had those um skate
shoes Cass Keeley's oh I don't think you
were allowed to wear they're going to
become the new you ease yeah I got on
those too yep get him get him get again
but tickle tickle
oh thanks oh come tickle me come tickle
me get him get him ollie get him they've
been doing this like oh did you get him
oh yes they've been doing this for like
a good five minutes get him come on
again this about you I'm gonna get you
run I'm gonna get you
I feel like I'm doing a really good job
at it now that I could probably vlog
around the house while writing it yeah
what what well we were like chasing each
other and that's probably why he's like
no you're gonna get me what do you guys
think about this video quality smooth as
butter right
I'm alright I bet this is way better
than any stabilizer would be what buddy
did you I'll get you my busy look at all
the lights just like reflects on
everything oh also so I actually did
fall I fell and I bled and it was kind
of funny but Missy see I was leaving for
work and so I was like I'm gonna ride
alongside you and you tell me how fast
I'm going and so I did it and I think we
got up to like 12 and then I just lost
control because you're not supposed to
go that fast and so I jumped off but
when I was jumping off when my feet hit
the ground
I wasn't balancing cuz on this thing you
don't balance you just let it balance
for you so you have to like teach
yourself to not balance and so because I
wasn't balanced I was like flailing all
over the place
and then I ended up falling back and I
just like scraped my ankle just a little
bit but there was blood I bled so jared
be ready for that but yeah I am
definitely enjoying it whoa what okay
you want to try he said I want to turn I
know he's but no no not at all no I will
not do that no you can't write it you
can't so suck
I'm sorry you're too little you'll hurt
yourself would you let him write a
skateboard yeah
anyway I think where I'm gonna go ahead
