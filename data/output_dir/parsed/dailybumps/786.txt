all day of course he's not gonna be here
till late we're not target we have to
grab my things more or less than things
right
gotta get diapers again but I'll tell
you I definitely learned my lesson with
not getting too many of one sides
because these babies grow too fast so
I'm not gonna get as many so I usually
like to stock up so that I've got so
many then I'll never run out and I never
have to get extras I now have any of the
boxes for twos they only have bags for
twos that's kind of a bummer I'd be so
much easier this is good
yeah they box one not two's got diapers
that's good I don't want to run out of
those cuz you or a peepee bottom all
right next stop Petco we go to Petco you
dog you and all the doggie okay hang on
so we are in need of some new rock for
hash tags little home right now I have
red and white in there and I want to try
to change it up what color should we do
ollie
yeah blue deficiency I pity you can't
hold the fishy
hey hitting that you're scarin who is
that turtle
he knows I wish we could get a dino for
it but I feel like that happen well I
don't know I think that's too big
we need something small I like this one
nice and small I am attempting something
that I really never do I'm going to cook
me cooking dinner tonight and I don't
like my dinner normally because I'm
actually not a very good cook I'm really
terrible at it um I also don't enjoy it
I do not enjoy Kathina ideas I do enjoy
baking I think also the reason I don't
like cooking dinner is that I really
don't enjoy food I'm definitely not like
a foodie because I'm such a picky person
my mom sent me this really cool recipe
that I'm really excited to try it cakes
are used to chicken alfredo but you
leave one pot so I'm really excited
about it I guess you just like cook up
some chicken which I'm doing right now
and then I got all my ingredients right
here we'll be adding some garlic right
into it then you add chicken broth
yeah we add some heavy whipping cream
then some penne pasta and then after
this all cooks and all that and it's all
soft then you add a bunch of Parmesan
cheese
