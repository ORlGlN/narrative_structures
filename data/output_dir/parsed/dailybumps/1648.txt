say good morning I had my first shower
today and you like to drink you hi hey
you you're really excited to be awake
and clean baby boy
is awesome baby
you are old
new amazing things
haha check out those jugs it's a
beautiful day in the neighborhood
no it is actually really nice alright
now it's like 88
it's been like 88 all night it did not
cool down at all you guys and it was
kind of sucky we just slept with a fan
on cuz NMR on the air-conditioner all
night it's beautiful morning today even
zombie is enjoying himself HP for
yourself I have to just run and grab a
few things before Heidi gets here Heidi
is Missy's YouTube friend hang out and
do a couple videos because they are road
tripping from Arizona
I believe so this might actually be
really nice for them because it is not
120 so they might actually like it here
hello guys so I'm starving which does
sometimes make a little more grouchy of
a Missy
look at this hands-on boy he is all
ready to meet Rosalyn hopefully he
actually makes it in this outfit as long
as her for when she gets here but I did
want to show you guys
he smiled this morning so I started
snapping some pictures and look what I
caught look at that cute little smiling
face like oh my gosh that was the face
he made right before he smiled cafe kava
kava kava kava kava kava cafe I love me
Shamas coffee Oh
iced coffee what yeah check it out I've
literally only had that much but I've
gotten away from drinking coffee in the
morning and I actually like it well I
like iced coffee lace not really like
hot coffee I mean you live in California
you're not supposed to be drinking hot
drinks
check out Missy's hair and how you guys
some hip hop pop star something like
that so style hey hey guy life isn't
that hard relax we're running to the CHP
which is the California Highway Patrol
and we are going to have our car seat
checked out basically there's a lot of
differing opinions when it comes to a
Prius on and where the safest place is
for Oliver to be whether it's the middle
decides and how it should be buckled in
or lashed and all that so there's just
like so much information
that it's confusing and we've tried it
like always and we seem to like the
middle the best but and we're pretty
sure the middles proper way to do it but
we're just going to have the CHP like
check it out we also did actually ask
Toyota we actually took the car there to
have Toyota check it and they said this
was also the safest place so we're
pretty sure this is where he's supposed
to be we're just gonna have a double
check yeah
like the sound of that click huh this is
a guy that can move okay
where I want you to come check it is
come check right here no more movement
than an inch an inch which way when I
decide oh I see so oh wow
see how where it was before yeah where
it is now that's crazy
I've done you know thousands of seats
what is he very secure yeah so we took
the latches off and we're just using the
belt issues and that's that's safer and
it's still good in the middle oh yeah
okay I would put my baby in there just
right now if I had one this big dang
well thank you so much that's awesome
that was interesting we guys didn't hear
we have it in the right spot but we had
at last gotcha did lachen I don't
know how he's they had fun glad she
basically doesn't need to be lashed and
just needs the seatbelt and he really
worked his butt off to make sure it was
tight and now it's like literally like
it doesn't move at all all you moms is
up high right here yeah you need to take
your car seat and because he says that
ninety-five percent at least 95 percent
of every car seat he's put in wrong
every car is different every car seat is
differ
I definitely take your cars you say
because I don't even think that we could
do that he definitely has to do that
experience he's done thousands of them
turn on the car and crank desi sounds
like all this poor guy like sweat beads
yeah but he was so nice and so yeah I
definitely feel better now that we know
a hundred percent that the car seat is
properly put in and he is all saving
everything so that's good
Missy is getting her babywearing ready
to put it in and I have to say she's so
good at an hour so you can do it in like
maybe a minute huh less than that even
if you guys are ever confused about this
we just put up a video and you can watch

the small setting so that was an easy
fix
Oh got him oh how could I face this cute

so sad can time this huge watermark
there and on the whole sleeve it's like
what I have to look forward to

first time in the car together and karma
doesn't seem to really care because he's
going to the dog park better between the
duct work and I fed are gonna put my
balls huh
crying don't laugh it up like that look
at Rosalind she's got a little bow in
her her and it matches the rap we had to
put a bow on because she looks like a
boy I think people have to know she's a
girl got some wicked arson going on out
here
he karma wants to play with a cart
Legation three yeah Coco come we're
actually at the park that I filmed a lot
of my videos at and this is her first
time and I it's so weird like Oh
pictures were hanging yeah you know yeah
like it's it's real it's a real thing
it's a real place yeah yeah it's so
crazy that Heidi's here right now like
it's just the coolest thing I can't
believe that like two YouTube channels
have just met and our powers come back
what did you do right look there oh my
god my god man what's your ball ball
three like I'm like in a cloud of dust
it's like in my eyes yeah this is
actually where we filmed the Mother's
Day video so Heidi's picture was hanging
just like right in those yeah the most
treated was I reared it's so weird
yeah yeah so it's right now I'm walking
through here holding all the girl you
feel like you're just in like a super
long daily bumps blog that's a little
bit yeah like oh and just walked right
through the computers vlog on end
look at the German Shepherd puppies are
so cute come on look at the cookie oh my
well karma told Jake the dog super cute
karma she there was ants that we were
changing the kids and there was ads and
so now Roslin's getting her diaper
change while standing up you want me to
take him hey my boy karma do you like
Ken's bowtie come here come sit sit Oh
or lay down he's pretty tired look at
okay so karma has this fancy Dancy
bowtie on and then ken has this fancy
dancy bowtie but Ken's is not a clip-on
yeah you tie that yourself yep well now
it's untied come on tile tied again
ah go tie test go try it
done and done
boom and he adjusts it but yeah that's
pretty good
Rosalynn what do you think of Daddy's
boat I says bowties are cool maybe I
should start wearing bowties babe was
where college wear a collar and a little
bow tie cheap and oh yeah
karma had so much fun he's even laying
down in the back he never lays down I'm
pretty worn out and he's so hot I feel
like I'm melting like a Heidi's tape oh
you can explain explain the test okay so
the test is you get your food coloring
blue food coloring and it doesn't work
yeah
I'm asleep or taste-making wait okay but
so crazy
instead of dye the tastebuds so we can
tell whether or not she had more or less
taste buds in the average person and
there's this thing called a super taster
where you have extra taste buds like
more than a normal person which is why
you don't like a lot of things so we
decided look at Heidi's mouth right now
define blue food coloring on my tongue
but now my whole mouth is blue wait let
me see your tongue hey just looks blue
something it like what is going on it's
because I put my tongue straight serve
in my mouth after we did it oh I see the
little speckles okay you can see them
how they're spent on Omaha you compare
so you have a lot in the back and a lot
in the front but none like in the middle
uh-huh so I just taste everything all
the time Friday okay all right Heidi
you're at what just don't worry he's God
you off it work not very well right cuz
I just think that because it's mostly
your shirt is that your favorite Vina
it's not pulling on the camera Rosalyn
problems wait I want some blood don't
get it on I'm walking again Oliver okay
but it saturate give it a moment not
what okay let's take like a turn all the
