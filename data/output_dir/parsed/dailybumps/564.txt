I'm actually performing on the main
stage tomorrow night and I'm going to be
sharing a couple of new songs with you
guys which I'm really excited about be
the first time anyone I see a shadow of
Jeffery in the bathroom right now we are
a little bit worried about Finn he's
been having a rough day he threw up on
the plane he's a little bit of a fever
so we're kind of just checking in yeah
he's really good yesterday I was like
should he even go should I stay but I
mean I thought it was just like a cold
and maybe I'm not really sure yet he
didn't have a fever when we left and he
seemed fine yeah so he definitely has a
fever right now we're just gonna watch
him closely and see this Bentley higher
I'll probably end up taking him to
Urgent Care just because I might always
my worry is like a UTI because he does
have some kidney he has kidney issues
issues a little bit not like issues but
it's just something that to watch out
for so if it gets any higher I would
have came to Urgent Care
which would really be a bummer but we're
hoping that he wakes up and everything's
good and yeah he definitely just needs I
think we all need sleep but anyway yes
hopefully we wake up in the morning and
I was good and we can go to play this
live and have a blast hope you guys
