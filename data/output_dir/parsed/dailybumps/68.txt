- Hey guys.
So today is going to be a
little bit different of a vlog.
We did not expect this today,
we actually had a lot of different plans
and not really sure any
of those plans right now
because we just recently, kind of,
received an email and a
lot of things have changed,
and I'll let Bryan kinda explain
what we're gonna be doing.
- Yeah, so,
we got an email
and it's,
(sniffs)
- You okay?
(Bryan crying)
- This is gonna be a
really difficult thing
for us to talk about
and it's gonna be a really sad vlog
and it might even be something
that you guys won't wanna watch, so.
- So we had a phone call
today with Make-A-Wish,
and there's this little boy,
he's five,
and he watches our channel
and he likes our videos,
- Likes our music.
- And he's not doing very well.
- Yeah.
He has Leukemia
and in typical Make-A-Wish situations,
we would go and, you know,
do a meet and greet,
hang out,
- Maybe, like,
get to spend the day with him.
- Yeah.
- You know,
like bring him some happiness.
- Yeah,
and this is just a really
much different situation.
He's basically looking at end-of-life,
doesn't have very long.
And so--
- So we had these plans,
and we're kinda just stopping everything
and like,
just talking
and praying
and crying.
- This is more important, obviously.
Nothing else matters.
If you get a request like this,
you know,
you drop it all, and you,
obviously we're heartbroken.
We wanna, like, help this family.
- So Henry's final wish is to meet us
and sing him our theme song.
I'm not sure if it's
Tribe or This is Home.
Honestly, I don't know
if we're really gonna be able
to get through any of them.
It's one of those things
that you kinda have to
remove yourself from.
And there's, like,
a lot of thoughts go in
your head that are, like,
They can be really selfish,
they can be very confusing.
I think it gets hard,
because we have this platform
and we never thought we'd
have to do something like this
and it's especially hard because
this boy is five.
- Yeah.
- It's a five-year-old boy.
- Yeah.
- We have a four-year-old boy, you know?
- I know.
- I can't imagine what this
family's going through,
but at the same time
if we can bring them any joy
or any peace or any happiness.
- Comfort.
- Then like, we have to.
I feel like it's our duty
as the people that we are.
- Yeah.
I wanna just talk about
how we're feeling right now
'cos it's hard to even imagine
how they're feeling.
But, you know,
the first thoughts that
come into your mind
when you're asked something like this
as selfish as it is, it's like no way!
And then you start to realize that
we know these things happen
every day, all the time.
We're all, a lot of us are in a situation,
where we don't have to think about it.
It's not happening to us.
And so, it's easy to just
take yourself out of it.
But, the truth is that, I
think that all of us would love
to help someone in this situation,
but there's never really
anything for us to do.
And in this situation right
now, there's not just a child,
there's a whole family, that needs us.
- We can impact, you know,
- That we can help and there is, actually,
something for us to do.
And so, obviously that is
extremely important and,
nothing else matters at that point.
- We're, kinda just like,
we're stopping everything,
you know, we have everything
booked to go to CES,
and do that, and we may end up out there.
I don't know what the rest of
the week's gonna look like,
but today, we have to get through today.
And, it's gonna be hard, but.
- We're gonna have some support,
we have Jeffrey coming with us, who is,
we're super close with and
he can also even help us get
through a song, if
that's what we're doing.
He can play guitar and stuff,
and then we've got my
Aunt Chrissie coming.
Who's a huge support.
He's actually done a lot
of stuff like this before.
- Yeah.
- And so, she'll be able to,
kinda, help us get through it.
I think, what we're kind of,
obviously there's a lot of
prayer going on in, I think,
we're praying a lot for
this family and care.
The heartbreak that's
going on is so unbearable.
But we also are praying for ourselves,
to be able to, like, know
what to say and how to,
and how to, like, comfort them.
I'm praying that, 'cos
we are like devastated,
in this whole situation, but
I'm just praying that when
we enter that room, that
there's some sort of, like,
peace that comes over us and,
helps us, really guide us through, like,
how to navigate this situation.
And this is definitely,
like, our worst nightmare.
It's not even just a nightmare.
- As a parent, you know what I mean?
It's what every parent thinks, so,
- But, it's not our nightmare,
the truth is, it's not our nightmare,
it's someone else's nightmare.
And, we just wanna, like, help them.
- In any way we can.
- In any way.
And we're debating how to
go about this vlog, exactly.
And, again, this is not about
us, this is about the family.
But we did want to share
with you, what we're gonna be
going through today, and
maybe why things are gonna be,
I couldn't imagine, I can't
imagine making a vlog today
about anything else.
- Yes, I think it's hard to explain that.
We can't, we can't, like,
make a fun vlog today.
- Yeah.
- It's not gonna be a fun vlog.
- It's not, it's, yeah,
it's gonna be hard,
it's gonna be sad and, you
know, there might not be
much to it either.
I don't think we'll vlog
a lot of this situation.
But, we wanna talk about
what we're going through,
and share with you, you
know, just Henry's story.
And maybe, you know, we
can all just, kind of,
pray that this family has
comfort during this time.
And know that this is not the only family
going through this.
I mean, there are an unbelievable
amount of people who are
dealing with this kind of a situation.
And it's just so easy for
people to just kind of like,
"I don't want to deal with
that, I don't wanna see it.".
But sometimes you're just faced with it,
and that's what we're going
through right now, so.
(sniffs)
I think we're gonna be,
heading there really soon.
