- Good morning guys, I have been talking
a little special project
that I've been working on
and I finally get to
reveal to you what it is.
(upbeat music)
- I am at my barn right now
that I board my horse at,
Nacho, he's right over there
and I gotta tell you that this has been
one of the most amazing experiences.
Horses have always been
part of my childhood
and a part of like my blood
and for Bryan to be
able to kinda like say,
like go for it, this is
your dream, let's do it,
was amazing, but the next step
was finding a barn that
I could fit in with
and finding someone who can
make this a good experience,
because it can be hard
to find the right people
to work with when you are doing something
that means so much to you.
Bryan found me the most amazing barn
and the most amazing person to help me,
as you guys know her name is Maria,
and she has literally
made my dreams come true,
she has made this experience so amazing
and she has thought me so much.
So this is actually Asher,
this is Maria's baby,
she has got a couple of them
and he is such a sweet little horse.
Maria just, she cares
for her animals so much,
and not just hers, she
cares for all animals,
and all her animals here,
she constantly says it's
just all about the horses.
So she has such a cool property here
and she always has like little projects
that she wants to get done,
and they usually involve
something to do with the animals,
whether how can she make the,
taking care of them easier,
or their life easier and better,
but there's one thing
that she wants to do,
but I don't know if she'll
ever really have the time to do
and it's for her, it's
not really for the animals
and that is this room right in her barn.
She actually used this room for her pig
that she got on Christmas,
who's the cutest thing, Wally,
and it was so cold and she
really had nowhere to put him in,
that she kind of put him in here,
it's a mess now guys, I'm gonna be honest.
She's like it's a mess and such a bummer,
but he now has a nice,
warm, cozy place to be
and now I'm thinking why don't we
make a really special
little heaven for her
that she can just come in,
relax, hang out with her horses.
It's actually a really, really fun room,
it's got a lot of space,
so that's why I thought
it would be so cool if I came in here
and just ripped out everything
and redid it all for her.
So they actually just left
for a trip for one week.
I got one week guys,
and they are off to a beautiful
Cabo to go relax in the sun.
They left and I was like,
okay let's get in there
and let's start ripping stuff up.
So today we're here and we're
basically just gonna start
cleaning up, ripping all these floors out
and just starting, starting fresh.
So we're going to try and use
as much as we can in here,
but her daughter was actually
telling me about this table,
I guess her neighbor
custom made this for her,
so I definitely wanna
incorporate this somehow,
maybe just kind of
refinish it a little bit,
or even just like clean it up,
maybe add some new hardware
and then we'll definitely
keep like cabinets,
and you know just switch out
a few things here and there,
but we definitely have to start fresh
and we gotta get going because
we are on a time crunch.
(upbeat music)
So this is Wally right here,
she got him on Christmas.
So he's the cutest thing,
but he is the one who destroyed that room
and that is where we're
going to fix up and make look
so cute since he's got a
nice place to sleep now.
-  Still going Wally?
- I think he was in there a
long time because he was cold.
- Yeah, but you know how
when you wake you just go?
He's still going,
okay can someone do a
Google search real quick?
How long do pigs pee on average?
Are you proud of yourself?
(upbeat music)
- So I am cleaning the
walls before we paint them
just 'cause there's a lot
of dirt on them and dust.
So in order to cover as
much wall as possible
I am using a Swiffer, it's all wet,
it's actually working pretty good.
(upbeat music)
So the scent in this room is so strong,
I actually feel like the ammonia
is starting to get to
my head or something,
but that's what I'm
saying, like this place
is not going to be just
like a treat for the eyes,
it's going to be a treat for the nose,
because we are going to make
this place smell so good.
And I have to say that I'm so
thankful to my dad especially
'cause he's definitely helping
make this really happen,
but even all my other like,
I have friends that are
gonna be helping me,
I had Brooke help me stuff pick stuff out
and I think she's even coming
up here later to help clean
and help me like decorate and paint
and even Bryan for letting
me do my crazy ideas
and he's just like okay, if
that's what you wanna do.
These kind of things just make me so happy
and just so thankful, even
to my brother, who's helping.
So many people are gonna help me
and we're gonna get this done so quickly.
So what do you think of
this crazy idea that I have?
- Well, it's not unlike a
lot of your crazy ideas.
Missy is one of those people
who's just always thinking
of something that she
can do for someone else.
It's gonna be super
unexpected, Maria's gonna.
- She has no idea.
- Be super surprised.
- She actually has recently talked to me.
She's like, I just really
should get that room done.
I was like, yeah, no, don't do it.
(both laugh out loud)
(upbeat music)
-  Finn, are you
getting ready to paint?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, all right guys, it
is almost painting time,
look at this, we've got everything out,
we're taking down the blinds.
We were gonna keep the blinds,
but they are just a little too dirty
and those ones are just like trash.
And I was like well, I'm
getting rid of those ones,
maybe I'll just fix these ones.
We are gonna start painting now, ha?
And that's why we don't
have the real flooring now.
So make sure you dip it and then kind of.
-  No!
-  You don't want
it to drip too much.
Oh, good job bud, Olli, you are here now!
Are you gonna help us paint?
- Yeah.
-  And you just did an O?
-  Yeah.
- The boys are being so helpful.
(upbeat music)
Oh my gosh, we just got
rid of all of the yellow,
all there is now is just a fresh
coat of prime on the walls.
It has just totally brightened
and like made this room
look so much bigger
and there is no bad smell, so
yeah, we got the smell out.
My brother's working on
putting a new knob here.
My dad is working on
putting the new fan in.
We are staying on schedule,
my plan was today to be done with painting
and then we will start
the flooring, woo-hoo!
We are getting it done.
I'm actually also doing quite
a few projects for the room
and some of them are like
a little bit personal.
And one is, I'm gonna be
taking some professional photos
with her horses and that is Brooke.
- Hello.
-  She's taking the
photos and we're trying,
we've got Rusty, he's
totally standing next to hay,
so what do you expect?
- He wants this stuff,
he has been working hard.
- This is what we're
doing, mom's gonna help,
she's gonna film.
(soft music)
okay, we just finished, Rusty was so hard,
I thought he was gonna be like easy,
I thought he was just gonna stand there
and just whatever, he was like, no.
But look at these, we got some cute ones.
Look at that, Brooke is so nice,
she's gonna like take these and edit them
and we're gonna print them fast.
Oh my gosh, she's gonna love looking
at pictures of you guys
in her little room.
Well thank you Brooke.
- You are welcome, this is so fun.
- I know.
We are now starting flooring,
oh my gosh this is so cool dad
and it's so awesome, Brooke
is now helping me clean it
and get it all ready and
then even Shaun, her husband,
was helping my dad, so
thank you Shaun and Brooke,
it is so nice of you.
Things are moving along
now, Kelsey's here!
- Hey!
- And she actually just got
done staining all these crates.
And we're making a little TV stand
that the TV won't necessarily
be standing on it,
and yeah, these were just like pine
and now she's like staining
them like this dark brown
and I think it looks so cute.
(upbeat music)
Olli, are you out here playing?
- Yeah.
- Um yeah, the boys are out here playing,
I just found Finn, he's
like a wild kid right now.
Put your shirt back on!
It is freezing out here guys,
like I'm wearing like a little jacket
and he has his arm out of his shirt.
I think he's just really
feeling the wild life.
Finn what are you doing?
Your cheeks are even red.
- He's just running around
this field with a wild goat?
-  I know.
- Grazing in the background.
- All right guys, the
room in the barn is done.
I spent about three days finishing it up
and it is so cute, I
love everything about it,
I love all the little details,
and I'll show you all,
everything about it in a minute,
but I actually went off on a trip
and I got back the same
day that Maria got back,
she ended up actually going
in and seeing the room,
which I'm really excited about,
I feel like it happened in a
real fun, natural way for her.
Her husband was so nice
enough to actually film the,
like her seeing the room,
which I'm really excited about to see,
but I'm gonna go ahead
and include it right here
so you guys can watch it.
- I just go, I just caught a glimpse.
(all chuckle)
-  Just go in, go in!
- Oh,
I don't even wanna walk, what?
Is this even my barn?
(all chuckle)
Oh my goodness, this is crazy.
What have you guys done?
-  Not us.
-  Oh my god.
- Oh, how cute.
Missy and Bryan, you guys are, oh my god.
-  Oh mom, there's a card.
-  There's card
here, look at the wine bottle.
-  Oh, you've
always wanted one of those.
This is better than my room.
- Right, I'm just gonna move here.
Thank you, I love you.
- Oh, she's almost crying.
And remember, you wanted
to, you wanted to do that?
- Oh it's showing Rusty!
- You didn't notice that?
(chuckles)
- Ah, he's so handsome.
I'm so excited, thank you.
- So I'm now headed up to go see Maria
and show her all the
little things about it
that she may not have seen,
and I'm just so excited to see it all
and I'm excited to be home so
I can enjoy the room as well.
It's gonna be so fun and so
far she has been messaging me
and she loves it, so I
can't wait to see her
and talk about it all with her.
(soft music)
I'm here with Maria and it has been so fun
showing her all the little details.
- Amazing, I'm so grateful
and thankful and excited
and I can't wait to spend some
time in here with you guys.
- I know, we're gonna have some drinks
and hang out with our horses
and Felicia's hiding,
she refuses to come out,
but I am excited that you
get to hang out here too,
because she's always up
in her and doing homework
and now she can do homework down here.
- She already did
homework down here today.
- This was like so much fun to do,
and I'm so thankful to my dad,
I know I like thanked
him a couple of times,
but I like could not
have done it without him,
and for Brooke, Brooke
helped me do tons of,
like the decorating and
of course the photos.
We were here one night till like 2AM,
just like oh let's put this here,
I mean this right here,
I mean you would be,
you'd be like why are you guys
spending an hour doing this?
But like, oh that's too
tall and that's too little,
but we had so much fun and
I'm so glad they love it,
I love it too.
- We love it!
- And I'm just, again I'm
so thankful for Maria,
like she has done so much for me, yes,
yes she has, she just made it so fun,
and I just, I literally feel like I found
like a little horse family with them
and it's crazy how little
time I've known them,
but how like, I just,
they're so special to me now.
- We are so happy to have you here.
- Thank you for letting me do it.
Anyways I hope you guys
enjoyed this fun little video.
