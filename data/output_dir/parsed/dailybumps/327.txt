(upbeat music)
-  We're in Legoland!
(upbeat music)
♫ Wherever you are,
that's where I wanna be
♫ All it took was a
laugh in that soft sunset
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said
♫ This is home
♫ Just running around
you never looked so cute
♫ Hugging you tight,
cuddling all I could saying
♫ I am home
♫ Home forever you're with me
- Morning!
- Good morning, buddy.
What're we doing today?
- We're gonna see Lego Batman.
- We're gonna go to Legoland.
We're actually just in the shuttle,
headed across the street.
We are gonna have a fun day planned,
and part of that day is
gonna be meeting Lego Batman
and Ollie is so excited.
We've never been to
Legoland with the boys.
I've been once, when I was
like 12 or 13 years old.
So I'm thinking there's going
to be a lot for them to do,
and we're really excited.
- Let's do this!
-  Who is that Ollie?
-  I don't know.
- That is a Lego Knight
and he's got something special for you.
You wanna go get it?
- Yeah.
- Go get it!
What do you say?
- Thank you.
-  This is so cool.
We got our badges
- That's so neat.
- And our pins.
- This says 2017 on it.
-  Yeah that's so cool.
Alright we've got out lanyards,
now we're putting on our first visit pin.
- Yeah and it's really spiky.
- Yeah you gotta be careful, huh?
Yeah. (laughs)
So what's cool is our badges
have little mini figs on 'em
and we can trade with any
other workers in the park
if they have a mini figure
that they want or that we want
we can trade them ours.
Ollie, so if you see someone
who has a mini figure
on their badge, you can
trade it for this one, okay?
So don't get attached. (laughs)
- You might find one that is
really cool that you want.
- Well, I want a Ninjago
that's got a red sword.
-  He wants a red
Ninjago with a sword.
- Ooh, that'd be cool!
- And this is our wonderful
Legoland tour guide Innocent.
She's gonna be givin' us the inside scoop.
We get to go behind the scenes,
we get to go on all the rides,
and she's gonna make it all happen.
So, we're super excited.
Thank you Legoland for hooking us up,
because Ollie is so excited.
- I hope the Lego door's not locked.
- It's not gonna be locked.
(upbeat music)
He is gettin' comfy already.
- Come on guys, get in here!
-  This bed can't
be comfy, you're crazy!
-  Just kidding!
-  He's such a little ham today.
- I know.
-  There's a very
cool Lego brick play area
for the boys.
-  Woo! (laughs)
-  Talk about
trapped in Lego bricks, huh?
And then they have this
huge Lego castle playground.
What do you think of this, Ollie?
Whoa, it's a skeleton.
Say, "Hi, Skeleton."
- Hi, Skeleton!
- That's right guys, we
are behind the scenes
at Legoland right now.
This is all the little pieces,
they're all categorized.
We have models here.
Look at this.
That is too cool!
Did you build this?
- I was actually the only
model builder out of all of us
that didn't build it.
-  So this is like a full model
of the new Lego Ninjago world?
- Full-ish.
-  Full-ish. (laughs)
(upbeat music)
You wanna build something, Ollie?
- Yeah, alright, you both get one.
Here we go.
There we go.
We can build with this stuff, right?
-  He thinks we're
building a rocket or space ship.
- Maybe some sort of vehicle.
What do you think this is for, Ollie?
- They could be wheels.
-  Yeah what's that part?
- Whoa, I made it!
-  You made something, huh?
- Ready to see what it is?
We are building, submarine.
-  Oh cool!
They showed us the completed
model for like 10 seconds
and now we're trying to build it.
- I'm crying.
- I'm getting close.
I did it you guys! I
made a little submarine.
Ollie is doing so good too.
Alright, we had so much fun
behind the scenes of Legoland.
And now, Ollie.
- Hey guys, I have to tell you something.
- Oh, okay, Ollie.
What do you have to tell them?
- I can jago sword!
- He's on the look for a Ninjago sword.
And we are officially in Legoland!
(upbeat music)
-  We're in Legoland!
-  We are on the island in the sky.
This thing gets up to 150 feet.
-  Wow.
- Look at that wind
blowing through his curls.
We can see the whole park from here.
We are now headed in to Duplo Valley,
which I think Fin will like.
Ollie, look at this little person.
Hello.
Come say hi!
Aww.
Fin, we're in your neck of the woods, bro.
Duplo Farm.
Let's go check it out.
(computerized clucking)
Hey Ollie, did you know
that the chicken is related
to the T-Rex?
- Yeah.
-  Isn't that cool?
Now we are entering The World of Chima.
He's got a big sword doesn't he?
-  Yeah.
- That's pretty cool.
We now look like Lego figures, you guys.
(laughs)
We're on a boat ride,
and the object is to shoot
the other player in the boat,
and Ollie really wants to do it.
And I was like, "I don't
wanna get that wet!"
People were getting soaked.
You ready Ollie?
Shoot 'em!
-  Wow!
(Bryan laughs)
- Shoot Ollie, go, go, go!
Get 'em, get the bad guys!
This is an arm workout for sure. (laughs)
Everything got soaking
wet, including the camera.
(laughs)
Ollie, let me see you. (laughs)
I'm sorry, kiddo.
-  We'll get dry, don't worry.
-  We'll dry off, okay?
- It's bad!
-  It's really bad, I know!
That waterfall came down on us.
Poor Fin got soaked too.
- I tried so hard.
I was like, "No, not the baby!"
-  Ollie is so soaking wet.
He's in this dryer.
How's it feel?
Is it warm?
How's that feel? (laughs)
- Good.
- I got soaked but that was so fun!
- Someone very special
is coming to meet us.
Who is that?
- Lego Batman.
- Oh my gosh!
Do you see his face?
- Yeah.
-  Look who it is!
- Well, hello there, Bruce. (laughs)
Go give him a hug!
Give him a big hug!
Hi, Batman!
He's so happy, that's so awesome.
Fin is like, "What is going on?"
I don't even know who that is, huh?
Alright Batman, I gotta blog with you.
Big fan.
Love the movie.
Good job.
Is there gonna be a sequel?
He's still waitin'.
I hope you get the sequel, I really do.
Shake his hand, Fin.
- Yeah!
-  Bye Batman!
-  Look at that cape.
- That is a cape!
- There's a cool cape, huh?
- Yeah!
(Bryan laughs)
- Look who else we got, it's Emmet!
Emmet is my fave.
I just gotta say, Emmet,
you are my fave right here.
(laughs)
Look who it is, Ollie.
Say hi, Emmet!
- Hi, Emmet!
-  He's gonna take
your slushie. (laughs)
- Just kidding!
- Aww.
Did you see Emmet?
I love Emmet.
Emmet is so cool.
Everything is awesome!
Can you dance, Ollie?
Dance party!
I'm embarrassing him,
we're embarrassing him.
That was seriously so cool.
Legoland set up a private meeting
with Lego Batman and Emmet.
- Ollie was so excited.
- He was so excited.
Oh, that was so cool to see.
Now we are entering something amazing.
This is what fascinates me about Lego.
This is Miniland USA.
And Innocent said, how many bricks?
- Over 30 million.
- Over 30, can you imagine that, babe?
So they have tons of little
set ups all around the world.
Built with just Legos.
(upbeat music)
We are now headed to Pirate's Cove,
where there's gonna be a pirate show,
where they go on water skis.
Very excited about that.
Ollie loves pirates still.
So there may even be an opportunity
for him to do something really fun.
Pirate's Cove, here we go!
Oh look and there's
some pirates over here.
They weren't even holding on, Ollie.
They were using their feet.
What was that?
- It was a gator!
-  They're on skis?
- Yeah, that's so funny!
-  Look at those guys.
Oh no, Ollie.
There's pirates!
How we gonna get rid of them?
- I don't know.
- I don't know either.
We got pirates, guys.
No!
Oh no, Ollie.
The pirates have taken over.
(swords clanging)
Here's the leader, Captain Brick Beard!
Look at his peg leg.
Push it, Ollie, push it!
-  One, two, and wheee!
-  Nice job, Ollie! (laughs)
Ollie you scared away all the pirates.
- I scared the pirates away.
-  Yes you did.
Good job, dude.
There's Captain Brick Beard
and he's being chased by a shark.
-  Enjoy the
rest of your day here,
at Legoland Florida.
-  Ollie are you
excited to go way up there?
Look up.
- Ready to go all the way up?
-  So they get to
like, pull themselves up
using the rope.
- Gotta work for it.
-  Yeah! (laughs)
Bye Ollie!
- He's not helping at all.
(Missy laughs)
-  Go up, go up!
-  It's a giraffe!
-  Yeah, it is a giraffe.
That's pretty cool, huh?
- I'm going to ride it.
- It's actually made out
of the Lego Duplo bricks.
And then over here we have
Albert Einstein, right there
and another giraffe over
here wearing sneakers.
He's wearing sneakers!
That's weird, huh?
- I see Nick's goggle.
-  You see Nick's goggles?
- Yeah!
(Bryan and Missy laugh)
-  I've been trying to teach him
how to pronounce 'Ninjago' all day.
- Nick's goggles!
- Nick's goggles!
Hey Ollie, say "Nin."
- Nin.
- Then say, "jago"
- Jago.
- Good job, now say, "Ninjago."
- Nick's goggle.
- Nick's goggles!
We are headed to Ninjago.
Ollie has been dying to go here all day.
The moment he's been waiting for.
They've got a really cool
ride and we're gonna explore.
See what they have for us, but sounds fun.
- We saw it in the mini form, right?
- Yes, yeah. We saw the actual
display behind the scenes.
So that's cool.
And look it, we're eating ice
cream out of a Lego brick.
- It's so good too.
(mystical music)
-  That's Kai!
Kai has fire in his
blood and he likes speed.
- He has a sword?
-  Kai has a sword, yep.
Jay is a master of lightning, huh?
You wanna go see what he has for you?
Jay's Lightning Drill, do you wanna start?
-  Go!
-  Push it!
Push that one, Ollie.
Get it!
Good job.
Hurry, hit the light!
Hi-yah!
Good job, Ollie.
I'm proud of you dude, you got 12.
That's pretty good.
- He has a sword too.
- I know, can you take it?
Oh!
Ollie, guess who's here!
Kai!
Do you wanna meet Kai?
- Yeah.
-  He's the one
who controls fire, huh?
Say hi!
- Hi!
-  Ollie, tell him
he's your favorite ninja.
- I'm your favorite ninja!
(Bryan laughs)
-  Ollie is your favorite ninja,
that's for sure, huh? (laughs)
Aww.
Come here Fin!
Come say hi to Kai!
Can you give him a hug?
Aww. (laughs)
He actually gasped.
What is that, Ollie?
Let me see it.
That is so cool.
Is that what you've been
waiting for all day?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
Should we get two and get one for Fin?
- Yeah.
- He's been asking for
a Ninjago sword all day.
I am so thankful that they sell them here!
- How about we can just get one?
- We need to get one for Fin too though.
And you and I have to battle, remember?
(martial shouts)
(swords clashing)
- Hiya!
(Missy laughs)
-  Oh, he got you! (laughs)
Oh, you got him!
-  Alright, we are
entering the ride now.
Ooh Ollie look at those swords.
So cool!
- That's the one I got!
-  That's the one we got, yeah!
-  That's Kai!
-  That's Kai!
-  You just met him!
And Nya,
Lloyd,
Zane,
and Lord Garmadon.
-  Yeah he's mean.
- And so is Scales, huh?
- Yeah, 'cuz he's mean too!
-  Yeah.
Aww. (laughs)
You killed the ride operator, Ollie.
(Operator moans)
Oh wow.
Who's gonna let us on the ride, Ollie?
(death sounds)
- Okay, okay.
- So we're at this little play place
called Pharaoh's Revenge.
And in it are these little
machines that spit up
all the balls.
And Fin is just doing his duty
and helping all of the big kids,
by picking up the balls and
putting them in the holes.
Look at him.
Good job, Fin!
Keep going.
Woo!
He's like, "I just cleaned up this mess!"
I feel like though, Fin is very
project oriented like this.
You know?
- He loves to put things in its place.
-  Yeah.
- Check out this double decker carousel.
It's so cute.
Alright Ollie, we can get on.
We're gonna go to the top!
Alright, go pick a horse.
I say get that one.
Ollie's got the black one.
Fin's got a brown one.
You gonna ride one, Bryan? (laughs)
-  And the horses
are off, aren't they?
-  That spins.
-  What?
- That spins.
-  Yeah that's how it works.
- Yeah.
-  Isn't that cool?
-  Yeah.
-  Let me get Fin going for it.
-  Whee!
- Ollie, did you have fun at Legoland?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we had so much fun, didn't we?
- Yeah!
- Yes.
Thank you Legoland for having us out,
and for giving us an amazing experience.
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.
If you did, be sure to give a thumbs up.
Ollie, thumbs up!
You are breaking all the
rules right now, bro.
Thumbs up, thank you guys for watching,
and we will see you mañana.
Ollie, can you say bye?
- Bye!
