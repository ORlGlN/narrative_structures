yeah it kind of is painful don't be king
good yeah it looks good
what up guys hope you guys are all
having a good Sunday um Missy and I are
gonna head out and go do a couple things
grab some food maybe see a movie really
want to see identity thief because I
really like Melissa McCarthy oh I want
to tell you guys that movie that I
watched last night Celeste and Jesse
forever it was awesome
you guys seriously need to check it out
Andy Samberg rashida Jones they were
just so cool and I love the way it was
shot you know it was kind of a smaller
movie so it wasn't like really
publicized a lot um so I had a more of
an indie feel to it it was really really
cool go check it out
Celeste and Jesse forever you guys also
I wanted to give a shout out to all our
subscribers on the East Coast I hope you
guys are all staying warm you know when
I saw Nemo in the news I really thought
they were announcing Finding Nemo 2 and
I was ecstatic and then I learned it was
a huge storm and I was sad so I hope you
guys are all staying safe um please stay
warm
also yesterday's vlog it gave me so much
trouble first I was dumb I forgot to add
the little clip to the beginning which I
actually really liked in our vlog so I
had to change it I had to add it and
then when I uploaded it again he left
out the end image and YouTube kept
giving me all these airs and it was so
frustrating I ended up letting it go up
again it didn't still didn't put in the
last image but everything else work so I
finally made it live so if you saw the
vlog appear and then reappear that's
what would happen the name because it
changed the thumbnails because we're
still not able to upload custom
thumbnails which is kind of a drag right
now me being the perfectionist that I am
so I had to put a new name coordinating
with the image and actually I liked it
better because Missy talks a lot about
chocolate in the vlog and she's obsessed
with chocolate did he do it good boy
he still can't do it like alone he has
to have someone there with him he's like
encouragement yeah he thinks he gets a
treat every time I'm going to
they're bred Missy's favorite place yeah
I just love their bread like she loves
anything with bread in the title right
yeah like if slightly like okay my thing
is you gotta I'm gonna go there you
gotta give me read/write and this place
gives you bread yeah like and the things
I don't know my wife video she gets
annoyed when I don't take her places I
have read so and we didn't before when
we came here we didn't even know what
Panera Bread was I just said I was like
oh do you want to try Panera Bread and
her eyes like lit up and she's like
bread yeah sure and it is a plus because
Panera Bread is in my Luther app so I
could literally pick my meal and count
all my crap that I need to before we
even get there
okay so Missy needs to tell you about
her own obsession it just went to a
whole new level here from there well I
just I wanted as much as I could get so
I kept asking like what can I do to get
the most friend what do I need to do she
wanted to be like a you pick too and
that instead of soup get bread instead
of chips get bread and can I have it on
the bread and can I get an extra bread
okay and then she just learned you get
more but if you just go full sandwich
and then she learned you can actually
buy the full bag app for 239 right so
you're gonna be here a lot I don't
understand why is it red so much better
I know you
so it's a bad gap by the way it's the
baguette that is so delicious and I just
I love butter so I put butter on its way
to she eats the sandwich has an excuse
to have a breath essentially yeah
it's slippery ah you did it you already
went she's cheating I stopped that sorry
yeah yeah turbo is that enough bread for
You Missy we'll see I mean my mom or I
got the Sierra Turkey on this vacatio
bread which is really really good and
then chicken noodle soup chicken do some
some 123 terrible so that's pretty cool
he sees people watching what are they
talking about
I was so good and I am so full missing
finish all the bread sheet I'm gonna
finish it in the movie yeah she's
totally gonna Mack on that sandwich of
the movie this acai berry on Sween iced
tea is really good too so at least never
disappoints so we just got carded to see
a rated R movie
17 years old is when you're allowed to
see rated oh and they carted us
ridiculous oh yeah okay but we look
older than 17 don't you think oh this is
our theater so we just got out of
identity thief and it was so funny
Melissa McCarthy is like my new favorite
actress now do you like it yeah yeah and
it ended nice too so that was awesome
and now Missy wants to find a red shirt
for Valentine's Day for her bump date
because it actually is on Valentine's
Day so we're going into forever 21 so
wish me luck a chrome manikins now they
look like they belong to like the x-men
or something
Missy walks by the eyebrow threading
place and she's never done it so
she's going to try it out
oh okay not too thin not mine oh
okay
what
oh it's hurt no weird how's it
physically like do you feel um being
pole no it just is strange feeling
really embarrassing I've been eating
just digital time ha it looks clean
sighs yeah yeah that is insane that is
so cool Missy okay so otherwise I can
concentrate
having a little child she's never done
it before
he's a brick
you're right you're right
there you go just take a deep breath
take a deep breath don't tell her that
she's gonna make me do it yeah it kind
of is painful yeah it looks good relax
relax
you gonna I know be good yeah noisy they
look good they don't cry hey don't cry
poor thing so tell me about that
experience business is the worst thing
ever seriously do that again
Oh worse than waxing yeah usually it's
basically the same thing but waxing it
like a billion times but you have
forgetten thousand times
it was so P I gotta tell you it was so
cool to watch she was like she'd like
put that thread in there and then like
rip all those hairs out insane - she was
so annoyed - she was so annoyed I can't
concentrate because you're kidding me
don't worry but you ain't on fire I
decided to have my eyebrows threaded
okay and let me tell you something her
so freaky and bad mom like she wouldn't
stop it was basic no like I kept saying
can I breathe a she's like I can't
concentrate again comes in Jay and I was
like it just hurt so badly and she
wouldn't stop feel like they're on fire
like they hurt so badly right now hi
bear will not leave me alone literally

trying to watch TV get diggin up Claire
please oh my gosh
he's just so furry you can't sit here I
believes it right there
lay down right there it's not gonna work
for you Oh
okay yeah this is not better at all
crazy kitty cat right there right there
good kidney so that's it for us I hope
you guys had a great weekend we are
getting ready for bed so we're just
gonna probably lay down and watch
something into we fall asleep Oh
Saturday Night Live was on and we DVR'd
it so I think I'm gonna watch some
Saturday live and go to bed also I did
want to let you guys know that I think I
want to change the time that I upload
the vogs instead of 9:00 a.m. I want to
start doing it maybe at like noon
because as soon as I'm done as soon as
what I'm done doing this essentially
like wrapping it up I put everything on
my computer and I just start editing and
I export and upload and all that jazz
and I think I stay up way too late and
so I think what I want to do is actually
go to bed and then wake up and just make
sure that I have the vlog up by by like
noon so I think I'm gonna try that
tonight just because I've been staying
up way too late lately and I think it's
because of this and I don't really need
another reason to stay up late cuz I'm
already a night owl so I think I might
try that with this one
so if you guys were freaking out because
the vlog wasn't up and 9:00 a.m. this is
why I wanted to try something a little
different so hope you guys had a great
weekend thank you for watching and we
will see you guys all tomorrow I like
your picture of your belly that's funny
hmm
cool it definitely I think yeah looks
they're from this angle
yeah some angle you see that every day
right yeah
