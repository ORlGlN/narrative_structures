Labor Day weekend and that means that
everything is a disastrous mess I swear
every time I started vlogging he's
trying to get fussy good so good think
he's like realizes and I'm no longer
paying attention to him and so he feels
you need to grab my attention but
anyways yeah so Liberty we can basically
tore our house apart
definitely going off of schedule means
that things are messy and diagnose may
be washed and clothes name three war
rooms need to be cleaned boy I gotta do
all kinds of cleaning and I do not have
enough hands to clean and take care of
this little guy he's been so cute every
morning now he gives me these cute
little smiles and I always go like oh
yeah you're smiling I grab the camera
and then he stops smiling huh you stop
smiling as soon as I get the camera out
you make these faces one of these days
I'm gonna catch you guys a smile okay a
real-life smile
hey guys I've been working hard in the
office all morning and is now lunchtime
and I'm gonna run into free Birds free
birds which I've been craving ever since
I've been here oh yeah this is happening
just notice they have these little like
foil sculptures everywhere the guy
because a bird cup oh my gosh these are
so cool
I am NOT that taunted old motorcycle oh
that's my favorite right there sounds
good
got myself a burrito and I went a little
crazy and I got me here it's a repair I
couldn't wait till I got to work to eat
it so I open it up in my car
and so good it's like a little tube of
awesomeness that is everything Mexican
nom nom nom nom nom he's on me you want
some of my burrito did have brains in it
no just steak rice corn cilantro
dang it Brian you know I'm allergic to
cilantro you guys so just finish my
burrito and I made a little sculpture
can you guess what it is it's really
really crappy but um it's supposed to be
a Golden Snitch
from arable uh so I guess that was a
good version one well you know what I
should do I should sign it and then put
it in there and then one of you guys can
go find it all right I initialed it and
I'm going to set it up here with all the
others
so if you're in this area you guys I
just left my mark at this Freebirds
it's right there and I've hit the Golden
Snitch and it's got my initials on it so
if you find it Instagram it to me
because I want to see it I want to see
if anyone is in this area that can go
get it we don't really put into
perspective how many people thirty-two
thirty-two thousand people is that's how
many subscribers we have and how many
people are watching the vlogs and how
many people actually might be in this
area
so if you're in this area go get it just
like go get it right we'll finish
watching this vlog and then go get it
and I mean make sure that you have
permission if you're under 18 and don't
like do anything illegal to get it
please I feel like maybe I should like
reiterate some rules I cannot seem to
get anything done today because my both
my carriers ones in the washer and one
is in Brian's car so it's like actually
said so much more difficult to actually
get things done when you've only got one
hand one to care for him and the other
to clean was he has been a little bit
fussy today that's a cuddle which I'm
super exhausted I've been thinking about
taking a nap now just cuz I'm so tired

one this week cuz he just looked so hot
with all this hair is your soul like a
big furry coat huh how's your little
brother doing you checking on him come

embarrassing to do on the camera Wow
