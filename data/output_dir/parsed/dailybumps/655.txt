yeah so my gosh I think I see one right
now you wanna go look yeah I know
getting on the players with Mama what
are you guys gonna go do you gonna check
the mailbox I'm never doing my seasoning
we're off to the mailbox and I have
crazy hiccups right now they're driving
me nuts
that's a warm day and actually it's
really really warming hopefully a day
that we should pop of the pool but I
think I'm actually gonna be finished
dancing coat so hopefully we don't wrote
down there we'll probably get in the
pool at some point
in the mailbox so we're out here right
now looking for snakes and lizards and
we've seen nothing so far Holly the
lizard yeah we haven't seen any lizards
and I'm surprised because it is such a
hot day I would think they are out but
look what we came across yes two huge
beautiful white flowers in that pretty
alley
yeah that's some one to me and Ali are
just riding around and check out what I
just found
all right that right there is a line
it's a snake line tracks the snake
definitely crossed through this path and
not too long ago because it doesn't have
any tracks over it as a snake around
here somewhere Kali
all right we are back at it again we are
working on the chicken coop always out
here playing were you playing with what
I was nail is he swimmin
my goodness - snails Wow yeah always up
here playing commas playing in the pool
right now and me and my dad are going to
work a little more on this we've got the
top on here
now we're gonna frame out the bottom I
forgot to tell you guys my chicken coop
came the other day and it ends up being
the wrong coop like they brought me the
wrong kit coop that I paid for so now
they had to set it up so now if I can
come till next week but that's okay we
still weren't done with this anyways so
it'll be done just in time for the
chicken coop and then we can get
chickens alright we are officially all
framed in now we just got to put the
wire around it but I'm gonna tell you
I've said it like five times today it is
so hot so freakin hot so I think it's
break time then we'll do the wire okay
so do you guys remember a few years back
when me and Brian bought a couch and it
was white and all you guys were like
don't get a white couch you have
toddlers and kids and it's gonna get
really dirty well I kind of got tired of
cleaning it all the time because I I
cleaned that thing all the time and I
knew that when we got to the new house I
was gonna want something a little bit
easier to take care of fortunately my
sister is actually moving out so I think
she's actually gonna want that couch but
me and Brian have been waiting for this
couch for a really long time
because it was kind of gonna be like
part of the centerpiece to our new house
and so
it just keeps going so it's kind of it's
gray
I think it's charcoal but it's gray it's
got a little bit of brown in it it's
huge
which is awesome because it'll fit the
entire family look at that thing
so freaking cool and it's like oversized
so it's meant to like lay and be
comfortable my house and just layout
yeah yeah it's not like a traditional
like classy ah classic couch it's like a
cozy slouchy lazy couch it's super low
which is nice too because if it's the
coffee table the TV it's so comfortable
you guys it literally feels like I'm
laying in a cloud right now I can't even
this is this is our couch so cool yeah I
didn't think you could get any more
comfortable than our other couch
honestly still in great condition in a
great couch and so I'm thinking it'll go
to either someone really like close to
us who wants it or yeah we already have
a couple people who actually do want to
buy it which is nice this is our new
couch and it's cool because this is a
kind of couch that like if we're sick of
the color in 10 years we can get it
reupholstered you know like yeah yeah
it's big we'll probably show more and
talk about more when we do like an
official house tour for this room but
it's kind of all coming together and I
do love this couch ah comfy we might can
we sleep here can we sleep on its way I
actually would wake up in the Mulla
night and watch TV on the couch and I'd
fall asleep on it she was so comfy hey
no oh my gosh I'm I really love this
couch I love a color feels amazing it's
huge it's exactly what we wanted
finally our house is slowly coming
together you guys I feel like this is
like the last big piece I was coming and
it's really just exciting because you
see our house starting from nothing to
something
actually thought it was the first thing
we bought and ordered and it took like
four months three months things about
three months yeah yeah it's here
okay you guys cannot believe I am saying
this but I set up all the house phones
and they're actually working which is
awesome so this is where the line is to
the gate so it goes into here
we'll probably have I think we have this
volume all the way down so we don't even
hear this basically just like what sends
the signal out okay and then I actually
have phones all over the place so we
have one in the living room and I also
have one over here in the dining room
over here and I actually just got all
the nest cameras set up too so we can
see what's going on so there's a phone
in there there's a phone in our bedroom
there's a put in our office they all
ring the gate they all open the gate
which is really nice big relief since
now we don't have to run to the kitchen
to open the cupboard and then answer the
phone
what's also really cool I didn't know
house phones could do this you guys but
apparently I can pick up this phone in
the living room and I can call the phone
in my office
so if Missy is like yelling for me and I
can't hear she can just pick up the
phone call and then I'll be able to like
talk to her she'll probably be like hey
you need to take out the trash or
something so feeling pretty accomplished
got lots of things set up got the nest
cams everywhere to which I like because
we can kind of just see what's going on
I actually have one in the play room
from here looks down into the whole
playroom so that when kids are playing
if one of the kids runs out and it's
crying and it's like someone's over
hitting me so no we did it you know all
that stuff I just be like let's look at
the footage see who hit who you know how
kids are okay
getting stuff set up and it feels so
good hey guys me me me and papa
