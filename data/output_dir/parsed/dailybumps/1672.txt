like I murmured he did not like that he
fixed it you baby boy son baby

take the morning thumpers today we are
up and getting ready
Brian's mom's coming over so we headed
this way not even coming over to me
she's here to visit him I'm pretty and
uh so I can't even hope you can tell but
it was a pretty rough night we were up
most the night weren't we Meili you just
wanted to be held on that he didn't have
a rough night I'm more had a rough night
oh he just wanted to eat and be held
most the night think he was was doing a
little bit cluster feeding love the time
with him so I love being up with him now
I'm exhausted
he didn't want to be put down he just
wanted to be held all nice oh that
pretty much was my night was just
holding Hammond trying to calm him down
you're mommy's big guy I have the huge
diaper on him today
I put my prefold on with a with a cover
it has just made look so huge but I
really like the diaper so who cares me
and Oliver are getting ready well he's
taking a quick nap of course but I'm
getting ready we're gonna go out today I
gotta get a few things so it should be
interesting
my first we've been out before but I
know it seems different because Brian's
not gonna be with us I am taking my mom
though and sister dish because that we
can all do something together but I was
sitting here trying to like write my
list of you know things I need and I'm
like going through them like what else
do I need
I'm like I need sleep can you buy sleep
guys um so I'm actually on my lunch
break I know you guys were hanging out
with Missy right now but I instagrammed
a picture that Missy sent me and it's
like the cutest picture in the world
look at this baby Oliver is just deep in
thought and so I start a little contest
and people are commenting with their
favorite captions and I'm gonna shout
out a couple of them that I absolutely
love I was literally like laughing my
head off in the office people are
holiday like what is going on
cassadee 19 said was that chicken okey I
tasted in mom's boob kia hicks e18 why
doesn't daddy make milk
Alysia Lee lien anyone what shall I need
my youtube channel and actually I made
me think what should we name his YouTube
channel hmm need sleep that's what I
really need maybe I can take a nap later
huh I'm really really enjoying it
everything I just love even our night
times are just so like nice cuz I get to
just spend my time with him which is the
best you know Taco Tuesday um I am so
happy that I did not miss Taco Tuesday
because you guys know I'm notorious for
missing Taco Tuesday but that's an
awesome thing about California is that
there is literally taco shops on every
single corner and you can get a taco for
like a dollar fifty it's pretty pretty
dope it's pretty dope I wish I knew how
to say that in Spanish but I don't if
you speak Spanish how you say pretty
dope in Spanish we are out and I
definitely am feeling like I'm on a time
crunch because I feel like he's gonna
wake up any moment and he's gonna want
me to beat him we're out and about so ah
it seems like he's doing good but I
definitely feeling like I'm on a time
limit and got certain amount I know we
need to get home hey come on my boy hi
karma as you can oh hey yo he wants to
give me hug okay gimme huh okay hi Oh
hugs okay as you guys can see I am at
home now basically I decided I'm gonna
call my uncle who's picking my mom from
the airport and tell him not to worry
about it and I'm actually gonna surprise
my mom and go pick her up
so she has no idea that I'm coming so
this should be really cool you know
yesterday we talked about how we're
calling my mom Graham after my grandma
and because she is a grandma now but my
grandma was notorious for surprises like
bringing up him like when you least
expected her to she'd just show up at
the door and like she take people places
randomly and like it was just shoot that
was just something she was really known
for and she kind of brought that sense
of surprise to the family so I'm gonna
do this in honor of my grandma I'm gonna
drive all the way to the airport and
pick up my mom and she has no idea that
I'm coming so it should be really cool
to see you're all surprised I gotta go
okay
you take care of Missy and baby Ollie
when they get back
okay we do that you want to go play with
your ball and take care of baby Olli
that is into a head till then okay we
did it we went all through wall or
through target without any puffiness
they slept through the whole thing but I
think it's about and of course I had to
pull out her heartstrings I made a
little sign that says gram on it so that
when I meet her I can hold up the sign
and she can know that she's gram and
she's gonna be so excited I never grew
up with a dad so my mom was like an only
parent and she was amazing
and so I really miss her really glad
that she's taking this trip out to see
baby Olli probably have to eat soon
before we go to anywhere else but he did
really good
so that was fun I was looking for a
little teddy bear to help him stay calm
because sometimes like a teddy bear that
maybe plays music but I could cry Niq
Niq don't look someone else so my little
app says that Oliver is hungry and that
it's time for him to eat but he's not
really sit he's not saying the same
thing he says it's time to sleep not
time to eat but I don't have to feed
them and so we're gonna do a little
feeding in the back of the car I was
gonna work though I feel like super
awkward he didn't like I don't know I
guess we'll see that was a hotel room in
the back of a van huh well that didn't
really work he wasn't going for it he
doesn't really think that eating the car
is
something that you should be doing timid
but really he just didn't want to wake
up I think he's okay for now he's only
been a couple hours so we're gonna we're
headed home in a few minutes so you
should be able to make it till then huh
no you're starting to regret your
decision now you want to eat now you
want to eat hopefully I'm doing this
right I'm not entirely sure um but I can
hear airplanes so think I'm in the right
spot I think never picked anyone up from
the airport probably should know how to
do this probably should know how to do
this before I got here but we're just
going with you guys we're just going
with it
thumbs up for spontaneous trips to the
airport to pick up your Jima
she's not my Jima she's Graham all right
I think she's down there somewhere not
entirely sure though still
I see her she's right there wearing
purple

down the room a little bit um it's kind
of a blank spot over here but just to
make things easier when I go to change
him and stuff Cassie thinks that his
eyes are officially green I don't really
know though you're a dark thing she
thinks you can see a tint of green in
there but no I still see it's it's dark
green I'm looking at like things like
dark blues oh me me anyway they are dark
green I don't know if it's I don't know
if it's official though cuz it's still
such a newborn oh yeah I'm saying
they're gonna I think they're gonna
light up to like a lighter green uh-huh

you would like a ship ticket if you were
to go like go somewhere on his ship I
guess and it's like from the old days
and so it actually has it punched in
marked but shows like when he was born
its punched on July and then on the 27th

that Brian made and I absolutely loved
it and so we're gonna be sending that
