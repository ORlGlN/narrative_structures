water has far I'm scared like when I go
into cannonball stand how much all this
is going to hurt and I like I can't hold
on to it oh my gosh that's crazy you're
not ready to take on that one then
really a person so the pool guy just
left he basically explained that there's
going to be a lot of programming and
setting up over the next week because
everything's still sort of not working
how it should for example all the pumps
were turning off after 10 minutes you
weren't able to keep them on so I played
with it a little bit back here but here
see it's like a it's like a scientist
layer back here I don't even know where
to begin I may have figured it out
because we want to keep the pump on
because that plaster
it's like dusty that we want to make
sure to get them all that water nice and
clean but I'm so happy with the pool
right now it's so oh so cool it's like a
dream come to a 101 not as good I don't
like being cold I do have a heater on so
hopefully I can keep the heater on a
little warmer and I got it it's like 70
right now he's trying to make it like a
nice 85 I'm sure everyone's like yeah
70s not that bad but look at the color
of it though it's just so beautiful like
from the step and help you put in it
like the starfish and the turtle yeah oh
so a more turtle more fish it was cool
being it was like add our own things
like design it how we want to feel like
my dad is obsessed with a moray eels
they look like and they don't fit
testing out the wall it's weird but look
it's vocal this is what the pool you're
going to learn to swim in Ben oh oh he
