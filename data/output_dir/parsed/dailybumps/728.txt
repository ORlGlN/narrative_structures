we're in Hawaii Wow Aloha good morning
guys TV spring break has begun we are at
the airport getting all checked in I
guess there was a problem with Missy's
mom's ticket they gave away her seat or
something so we're hoping that they can
get a spot on the plane scary not a fun
way to start the day security - yeah all
are you ready make sure you're on your
best behavior when we go through
security okay okay yeah we want to keep
you well we are not sitting on our plane
we are sitting in the customer service
area for American Airlines they delayed
Missy's mom and dad for a long time we
were in security for over an hour
Missy actually made it to the gate at
8:00 a.m. which was what our departure
time was and what happened the flight
the plane was gone there was no claim
that there was no plane like it was not
that father's went mine that a plane was
leave before departure time without
seven of its passengers including two
kids no in at least seven claim no there
were people in our line
we're waiting also oh yeah pretty peeled
right now doughnuts
yes we got Dunkin Donuts to ease the
pain easing the pain with doughnuts all
you want to donut we do take a bite all
right more for me all right so they're
boarding a flight to Honolulu right now
and we're basically just standing here
and hoping that we make this flight as
if we don't make this flight then we
have to stay here until 6 p.m.
you keep saying 6 p.m. it's so nice
honey but 657 practically 7 yes so we're
really hoping that we can get on this
one it's been a nightmare yeah they
tried to get us into the next flight but
that didn't work so they actually booked
us for almost a 7 p.m. flight we're not
going to be in Hawaii until 11 p.m.
completely rude yeah like they were not
nice even though it wasn't our fault in
your being very nice to them like they
were not nice to us their system seems a
little messed up another lady said to me
because yeah we just had 22 people
missing on a fight and we left without
it I was like there's 22 people missing
and they're all checked in and they're
all checked in they're just you know in
security and they're not going to get
them 10 minutes not going to hold that
fight for any amount of minutes they
will need 10 minutes early in fact now
we get to spend the day in the airport
and fitness not even the hard one it's
only he doesn't can run around and play
and he can't all right we are leaving
that terminal far behind and headed to
terminal 7 now we have booked a much
student like Missy Missy as the Savior
yeah so we're going to get a refund from
American and Missy booked another flight
with United so we're actually headed
over to their terminal now because I

stressful right now but everyone's happy
