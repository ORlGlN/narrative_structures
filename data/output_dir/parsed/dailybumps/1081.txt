you want to sing 982 everyone mmm
kissing ruff
good morning guys we are on our way home
we cannot wait to see our baby we miss
him but we've actually been driving we
actually left in a great time so there's
been no traffic yes and I've actually
been on the phone like the entire Drive
basically we had HMO plan it was not
working for us unable to get Oliver in
to see neurologist for like a month or
two yeah and it was even like a stat it
was just everything was just kind of
pain like that we could only use certain
doctors and then we did use that doctor
they were months out and we couldn't
switch it and it was just a big
nightmare and so like lo and behold like
I swear it was like all God but we were
able to switch to a PPO plan so that's
like totally different basically we can
go to any gosh we want we don't have to
go to like our primary first to get like
referrals or anything just call the
doctor and be like hey I need an
appointment oh you don't have an
appointment for a month later then I'll
call a different doctor so
having insurance if you can't go like
yeah later
yeah it is just kind of ridiculous
though definitely can't do HMO we just
don't fit the age of okay the age of all
plants aren't good for people who don't
really need to see the doctors a lot and
apparently we do need to do it on here
in ten years probably probably at least
I don't think he's ever been to a doctor
since I'm so I'm going to really know
the doctors paid and they're gonna have
like a list of things but this has been
happening to me and they say about right
today we're pretty excited it definitely
just happened like randomly and it kind
of just it was a real blessing because I
couldn't imagine having to go the entire
year with an HMO plan so anyways yay we
are headed home and I'm really really
ready to see my baby I got a really
relaxing trip yes we really did like I
feel like I got so much rest and because
even this morning like we woke up we had
breakfast and then we just like slept
and like took a nap and it was just
really nice I think it was kind of
needed I think that it is really good
for like husband and wives to get away
like at least once a month like ghosts
on the night somewhere else and just
like relax and just hang out if you have
that option why not yeah I feel really
fortunate that Mimi wants to watch all
the way all the time and you know what
honestly my parents today and I would
stay with my grandma and grandpa
basically once a month they would just
like go up to mountains and they'll
spend the night and just have time for
themselves it's really important and
it's important for us to spend time with
our grandparents
so it was really much needed and I
definitely hope that we can do that
every once in a while bed then me me and
aunty make you a good lunch at Agra just
have mommy like it this - what is this
yes but worn this in like six months

you guys know Easter is coming up and I
really want to take all a to do an
Easter egg hunt
I bought little Easter eggs and I'm
going to hide them around the house so
each one of them has like a fruit snack
or it has a animal cracker in it so I
just thought it would be fun for him to
find them and then see that there's
something fun inside even though it's
just like one little thing I'm sure most
of the Easter eggs will actually have
candy and you won't really be able to
eat the candy yeah I just thought this
would be fun and get him in kind of the
idea of what Easter well not wasters
about but what he can do at the Easter
egg hunts so I'm gonna hide them for you
okay okay all right
just go in right here oh crap there one
right here there well do this one a
little bit more in it
so I got them just kind of scattered
around the house now I know he's really
dying to go find them so we'll see if he
gets the game alright all I hung out
with daddy
well I hid the eggs someone oh good job
here can you put it in the basket
good job guy will find more where the
other ones oh oh yeah can you find more
Easter eggs put it in the basket
