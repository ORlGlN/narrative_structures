see they want you to drink a whole
milkshake I can do it and they want me
to eat the stuff that I put in the
hummus the tahini a spoonful of tahini

over the place I'm not even kidding
janessa you are evil the chubby bunny

I couldn't believe the peanut butter
thing on a white bed - I really thought
she was gonna get peanut butter all over
our bed sample different flavors of baby
food that might be a good one not just
desserts no I would follow this he's not
good with eating stuff oh good I love
that they want you to eat one of Karma's
cookies okay well absolutely I couldn't
maybe you can maybe eat one of Commerce
cookies
hello oh hi hey Missy 1990s calling on
the on the home phone hi how are you I
don't even remember the 90s that was
great is Will Smith Will Smith is around
right yeah
yeah we normally don't talk on phones
like these because it's kind of an
inconvenience look at all these monsters
eight
I love monsters saying my mom too
actually
my mom loves monsters eight this is
belly feels rock-hard right now it's
like super tight I'm not worried
that's so cool now but it just feels so
weird wait it's not like that like all
the time no this is how it is no oh this
is how it is now yeah are you serious
this is like how my belly is it's like
always tight like this oh my gosh that's
cool okay so we actually are in Walmart
right now cuz mrs. buying office
supplies but I just heard a comment
someone daring us to dance behind people
without their knowledge in Walmart that
might be happening that's actually
really funny too because I filmed me
dancing behind Missy and she didn't know
it that was before I got that comment
well I want to tell you that your were
approved in your number 25 MLS already
at number 225 like that's really cool
Wow
317 votes yay thank you guys so now
things are gonna get real
oh yeah is that good that was pretty
good
okay so that was super fun I cannot
believe I did that you guys okay I mean
I don't know if it'll be funny how you
know how it turned on the video but it
was really funny we were there and I
would you're doing it right now oh my
gosh yes right now
Oh Missy's telling me that when I when
she's talking oh my gosh I was when I'm
telling her and she's talking I will
like mouth the words she saying behind
me oh my god I cannot believe that you
caught that I was looking like stuff
you're doing yeah I need a camera on
this side oh my gosh what's wrong with
me okay here's the thing I think that I
do that like I'm now the what she's
saying so that I can understand it like
twice as much in my brain because I'm
the one who edits all the vlogs and so I
have to go through all the vlogs and
like choose what to put and so and I
know how to do it pretty easily probably
because I know exactly everything we
filmed today but that is so funny I
cannot believe I just hit twice we were
just talking about that yesterday oh my
god oh yeah I was just super funny when
he was doing it it was super scary like
I thought everyone was I thought like
especially guys I thought they're gonna
reach out and punch your face yeah I did
think it seemed like a couple people
were like like skin gently out of the
corner there I'm like walking looking
for you why are you behind hey Dee
Kirkland zero three one zero that was a
really great dare and it came at the
perfect time because I was just
refreshing comments while we were in
Walmart when Missy was shopping to get
supplies so yeah it was perfect
that was perfect and you're getting it
later alright guys so we are headed home
to pick up my mom so we can head to my
doctor's appointment yay so we get to
see the baby again I'm just
it feels like it's been a while since
we've been since we saw your OB yeah I
mean actually it's been four weeks four
weeks and that's the longest we've ever
gone to should we usually go every two
weeks but two weeks ago we also want to
see my high-risk point doctor so it's
only been two weeks since my last
doctor's appointment and I really I saw
the baby like a week ago because I am
obsessed with seeing my maybe he's just
so thank you I can't it's funny that you
actually mentioned that because she's
been feeling like butterflies and she's
like never sure if it's the baby you
know other pleasure good or it could be
the baby or the bean burrito or you know
that I'm really jealous of your blood
pressure mine is always a high side
absolutely perfect so and they said for
sure for sure baby boy hey hey there be
that's not a no to me that's a pee pee
they annoy more yeah and everything I
see what's really really good I love it
fluid fluid looks fantastic who has a
similar type of situation you have and
she was really scared and I said you
know what I really want you to see this
patient of mine because she's so amazing
she's got such an amazing supportive
family and you know a bike or a uterus
people can do really really well with
and so far you're exactly that person
did you see hi everyone normal whine no
one dares him do anything on Karma so
you stopped back from the doctor's
appointment and it was super awesome
definitely check out my bump date if you
want a more in detail of how it went but
he just chucked the baby and the baby
was perfect and getting so big he says
he's about the size of like if he were
spread out he'd be about the size of his
hand
just huge have a baby inside me earlier
today I had to dance behind people in
Walmart's / your guys's request and now
Missy's gonna take a dare from coma
Queen 17 who says that we should do the
chubby bunny and I think since Missy had
it pretty bad yesterday with the whole
dog licking peanut butter off her face
that was pretty brutal I'm gonna give
her that one just because I think it'll
be funny and probably not as messy my
guess is that she can do 12 marshmallows
everyone else is saying like maybe 6 or
7 how many do you think you can do I
don't know I've never done this before
ever I don't even know I don't know I've
no idea I'm gonna do it I mean they're
pretty big marshmallows
yeah okay so you know the rules of
chubby bunny you put a marshmallow in
your mouth and you say I'm a chubby
bunny karma really want should we just
give them a marshmallow no oh he just
snatched it up in my I'm a chubby bunny
come what okay you'll fit my million
here I would probably bunny don't laugh
I'm some bunny
that's only three put him in your cheeks
say it say I'm five that's all you could
do I guess okay that's sad yeah okay
okay let me try so I bigger cheek so I
probably do this a little better so I'm
gonna try to just cuz here we go I'm a
chubby bunny how much having bunny Oh 12
or 13 right but Wow did you actually do
more than me I did just hard
no look at the mini marshmallows no four
or five that size we both suck at this
maybe you're supposed to use mini
marshmallows I just don't know all I
know is there's a bunch of chewed up
marshmallows in front of me and I'm
under ahhh
okay so now that I have this cool ninja
chopper I looked online for things that
I can do in it and I guess it's really
good for chicken salad so I have a bunch
of stuff here that I'm gonna make
chicken salad with I have chicken that I
just grilled up in seasoned and then I
have some little chunks of sharp cheddar
and bell pepper and then I'm also going
to use this male with olive oil this
stuff is awesome because it's a half the
fat and calories of regular mayonnaise
so it's good for you and it does has no
taste difference like Miracle Whip does
and I think I'm gonna throw a little bit
of this classic ranch it's yogurt ranch
which is 45 calories or so I think it's
more than half the fat and calories of
regular ranch dressing - I'm going to
add a little bit of that and then also I
love dried cranberries so I'm gonna put
some dried cranberries in there as well
and chop it all up and see
happens yeah so I have everything in
here now I got a thin layer of
mayonnaise on the top I don't think
that's gonna be enough but I'm just
gonna do a couple quick chops and see
what happens
looks cool yeah yeah whoa that's so cool
oh it smells amazing I'm gonna put
instead of more mayonnaise I'm gonna put
a little bit of this yellow that
actually doesn't actually looks like
enough Mayo
I mean does yeah I know it called for
like a half a cup of mayonnaise on what
no way am I playing oh my god isn't it
gonna put just a little bit of this
yogurt ranch but yeah looks amazing and
it's got cheese NIT I've never had like
cheese in chicken salad oh all you do
okay I got a little bit everything hey
mom
those really good that's amazing that's
like the best chicken salad I've ever
tasted Brian only eight Oh here you know
Brian only ate half of his bell peppers
so I gave karma the other half and he
hasn't been eating his breakfast he's
been kind of big he is picky with food
everyone small but now he's willing to
eat it because he got bell peppers at
him and he loves bell peppers so I just
got done filming my bump date which I'm
kind of sitting here now hoping that it
turns out fine because you always worry
about it and you don't need to know
sometimes well like the thing is is that
it's always so long and I can never
remember like what I really said and I
ramble a lot sometimes it's always stay
here after I finish my bump date and
just like stress like I hope it was good
I hope I said everything that I want to
say I hope I didn't say too much so
that's pretty much what I do so I did
want to mention that we had some super
super awesome dares today that we
actually we were willing to do a lot of
them and we wanted to do some like crazy
ones that were on there we have two
weeks that is going to be full of
probably craziness so with
easy at least for me I mean what he did
was like crazy I was like I could never
do that like I'm so afraid of being
embarrassed thank you guys so much for
giving us a dare and then hopefully we
will get more dares tomorrow and have
fun with it I probably look ridiculous
