- I just wanna like, mark off everything
on the United States
and then start working--
-  I know, babe, I
have our passports, let's go.
- Let's do it.
- Where do you guys wanna go next?
♫ Wherever you are,
that's where I wanna be
♫ All it took was a laugh
and that soft sunset
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said
♫ This is home
♫ Just running around
you never looked so cute
♫ Hugging you tight
cuddling all I could singing
♫ I am home
♫ Home's wherever you're with me
- Good morning.
What are you doing, Ollie?
- Going to school.
- You're going to school
and he is super excited for school today.
School is only twice a week.
He like, wakes up every day like,
wait, so there's no school?
And I'm like, nope, just two times a week.
Are you gonna learn stuff today?
Alright, let's go.
I am back home and I
am trying to get things
cleaned up because me and Kelse actually
have a really fun day planned.
First we're going to the gym
which we went yesterday together
and it was so much fun.
I usually, well, I have
been going by myself
and it was pretty cool.
We got to like, do some
machines and run and it was fun
but we're gonna do the same things today
but for Kelsey's birthday
we are going to a spa
so I'm trying to get things
cleaned up before I leave
because Bryan's going
to be here with Corbin
with the kids and me and
Kelsey are peace-ing out.
That's what we're doing today.
We're really excited because
it's been a long time
since we've been to the
spa, so let's do this.
Are you gonna be good for your Papa?
Are you gonna be good and let your Momma
have fun today?
(laughs) She's like, um, I don't know.
Let's see how it goes.
You're so cute, alright,
you have a fun day, okay.
- Well hello guys.
Today has been a very busy day.
We've got lots of stuff to do this week
to prepare for our brand new family song
coming out on iTunes on Friday.
If you guys follow me on social media
you guys saw the announcement.
Our new family song, Tribe,
comes out this Friday
and I'm so excited
because we all sing on it.
It's so representative of families
and it's supposed to be
really empowering for families
and it's something that
we love and the boys love
and we're all so excited for
you guys to hear it, so yes,
new family song, coming out this Friday,
been preparing for that.
Ollie's at school and Finn is taking a nap
so I'm using this time
to get some stuff done,
and Missy's at the spa and she's having
like, an amazing day and she deserves it.
By the way, I just realized
all of my air plants
are taking a bath and they
are ready to get dried out.
So I love these air plants, I have a ton,
I'll show you right now.
These are all my air plants (laughs).
I actually just got a bunch
because they're so cheap
and they're so easy to take care of
and check out this one you guys.
So this is all you have to do.
All you have to do is soak
them for about 30 minutes
and then you let them dry.
Check out this air plant though,
it's starting to bloom.
That means it's gonna change colors.
Do you see those pinks
and purples coming in?
This whole thing is gonna look amazing
in just a couple days.
I'm gonna put it somewhere really cool
so that I can watch it.
(upbeat music)
So I think all you Harry Potter fans
will really appreciate
this, check this out.
I was just showing you all my air plants
and how I have them
scattered all over the house,
like in different, cool places,
well this is one of them.
These are my Harry
Potter trio collectables
and I have one of the
air plants right by Ron
because it reminds me of
the venomous tentacula.
That huge plant thing that like,
they had to like fight
in The Sorcerer's Stone.
So I was like, that's such
a cool place to display it,
but check this out, I got the whole,
I got the whole trio.
I got Hermione with her time turner,
Harry and Ron is kind of
tangled up in the plant.
-  Oh hey there Finn.
Are you hanging out with
Daddy while he's working?
I'm home, me and Kelse
just got back from the spa
and it was so amazing, so
relaxing, it was so nice.
Bryan is now in his office
editing, working like crazy.
He has just been working so hard lately.
It's actually been kind of sad.
Like we actually have been so busy
and he's been working that
we haven't really hung out
as much as we're used to.
Like normally, in a day like me and Bryan
are together a lot and we're doing things
and making fun videos and stuff
and lately he's just been
like, doing a lot of work.
But it's good, it's all good stuff.
Anyways, I am home and just trying to get
the house cleaned up a little bit.
Natalia and Jeffry actually
picked up Ollie today
which was awesome because
Bryan was like, super busy
and I was at the spa and luckily
they were totally up for it
so I guess he's been
having a really fun day
with the Johnsons and I think they even
went out for like, ice cream or something.
So I'm sure he's happy.
Finn has been a crazy boy.
Huh, you been keeping Daddy busy?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but I have missed Ollie so much.
We haven't seen him all day.
He's been at school and then out and about
so I think he's gonna be here soon
and I'm excited to see
him, but for now, dishes.
Guess what, Finn?
I hear your brother outside.
I think he's here, is he here?
- Hi Missy.
- Who's here?
- Did you know Oliver
got snow cones with us?
-  He got a snow cone?
It's all over your face (laughs).
Did you have fun at school, I missed you.
- I miss you.
- I miss you.
-  Excuse, what's going on?
What are you guys doing in here?
Hi Peyton, how was school?
- Good.
-  Good, let me see
what color is your mouth?
What color is your mouth?
What color is your mouth, Finn?
(laughs) Finn's is fine because
he didn't have snow cones.
What color is your mouth?
You're good too, did
you not eat snow cones?
- I had birthday cake.
- Oh, there we go.
- The cake is just white.
- Oh, okay.
Hi guys, how was school, Ollie?
- Good.
-  It was good?
Do you like going to preschool with Ollie?
Yeah, the Johnsons just
dropped off Ollie from school
and he did so good.
Okay, Ollie, did you eat
all your lunch at school?
- Yes.
- Did you take a nap?
- Yes.
- Did you learn things?
- Yes.
- Did you guys learn
about the letter H today?
- Yes, yes, yes.
-  Ollie, what
starts with the letter H?
- Um, help.
- Help, good job.
He's got like, clown lips.
They're all just playing,
the kids are all just playing
in the guest room.
You guys are so funny,
alright, I'll leave you alone.
(laughing)
It's normal right, a bunch of kids
just playing in a closet?
Should we scare them?
(growling and screaming)
You guys are all trapped in here forever.
(growling and screaming)
- You guys, I am so excited
because today we had
someone come in and help us
clear out everything down there.
It was getting really
like, just full of weeds,
so much brush to the point where like,
you couldn't even drive
through it with the Polaris
but even just going down there,
it was just, know there's
like snakes and everything
living in it so I'm gonna go take
a drive down there right
now and go check it out.
It looks so good though just from here so,
I'm gonna get the pups,
they've been sitting in the side yard
and I'm gonna go check it all out.
Hey puppies.
Do you guys want to go explore?
Come on.
And go.
Alright, we're taking the drive down
we've got the dogs loaded up.
We're gonna go check it out, okay boys?
- Okay.
-  Look at that.
It's so clean.
Wow, I guess the guy said
that there was even poison oak
growing all in here because
it's been like, neglected
for so long so hopefully we
can keep up on it from now on.
We really do want to make this whole area
just a really fun area, like a nice area
that you can walk through.
We want like a little decking area
to have like, picnics and stuff like that.
So we're super excited about this all
but we definitely had to start with just
clearing it all up and getting it ready.
Okay, do you guys
remember when I showed you
the amazing flower on this cactus?
Well now look at it, it's
completely shriveling up
into itself, it's turning
into a little ball
and then it's literally
just gonna crumble away
and check this out, overnight
this little guy popped up.
This is a brand new bud that's going to
turn into a flower just like that.
Isn't that incredible?
It's seriously like, out with the old,
in with the new overnight,
overnight you guys.
Funny thing is too, we might actually have
two big star flowers at
the same time on this thing
because there's two buds back here
and then there's three more in front.
This thing could possibly be full of them.
So neat, I love plants like that
where you can just like, see
them constantly changing.
And you guys are gonna get to see it too,
you guys are gonna get to see that one
turn into a new flower literally, probably
in the next couple of days.
Whoa, you like your new bean bag?
- Yeah.
-  Do you like it?
And go.
(laughing)
He is a wild child.
He always has to put his
hands behind his back too.
Look, okay, and go.
He's getting really good
at that jump though.
Check out these new bean bags.
These are the boys' new bean
bags for their playroom.
They're a little big.
- They are a little bigger than we hoped
but we really needed new ones.
Those ones were so dirty and
we can't take the covers off.
-  Yeah, that's right.
And this one has a big pocket
too which is really cool.
Kind of looks like a wolf.
The one thing we haven't
shown you guys yet
is our new map of the
world, world, world, world.
So I found this map on Amazon
and it's one of those maps that you
scratch the places of where you've been.
So right now it's kind of
boring and black and white
but we gotta fill this baby out.
We gotta scratch where we've been.
We gotta travel the world.
- This one's really cool because
it has like, every name
of all the countries
and even the states which is neat.
And then it also has all
the wonders of the world
which we've been to quite a few of
so that'll be fun to scratch off
and then all the flags.
-  The flags of
where you visited too.
- So that's really, I'm excited.
(laughing)
-  Yeah, and so the more we travel
the more colorful this map will get.
I think it'll just be
something really cool
for our family to have.
- It's actually kind
of inspiring to go more
because you're like I wanna get them all.
-  Totally, I'm like, Russia,
that'd be a nice big
color, maybe we should
just go there real quick.
- We can just go there real quick,
maybe we'll do like, we'll go to Finland
and then just pop over to Russia
and then we can mark that right off.
-  Yeah, pretty cool.
So we're gonna scratch this thing off?
- Yeah, let's do it.
-  It came with a little scratcher.
Alright, Finn, this is
our map of the world.
Ollie, have you seen our new map?
- Yeah.
-  Remember all the
cool places that we've been?
Remember when we went to London?
-  Yep.
-  Yep, well we get
to do that one right here,
we have United Kingdom and France.
Finn's like, let me at it let me at it,
I'll scratch the whole thing off.
That is so cool.
Look at California
Missy, it's bright blue.
-  That is so neat.
-  Alright, I'm gonna do Florida.
See what color it is.
Looks like a purpley-blue.
-  Like a dark blue maybe?
-  Oh, this is hard.
-  I know.
-  It's okay if we get into it.
Oh, and Alabama too.
Been there done that.
(playful music)
Definitely been to Canada.
Just a little piece of it.
CN Tower, this city is so cool.
We definitely have been to Hawaii.
That is the most amazing (mumbles)
I have ever seen in my life.
Hawaiian pineapple babe.
We found St. Croix,
we've been to this
little island right here.
So this is the Caribbean Sea
you guys, it's beautiful.
(playful music)
So now that we've done
the top half of the map
of where we've been,
we get to come down here
to the wonders of the world
where we get to check off
all the wonders of the world
where we've been and all of the flags.
(playful music)
- Where were you?
- We live right down here
in Southern California
where it's nice and hot.
-  Isn't that cool?
Look at our travels you
guys, this is so cool.
We've got five wonders of the world,
we've got a bunch of flags.
- Yay, this looks so cool.
-  It's exciting.
- Now I just wanna mark off everything
on the United States
and then start working--
-  Babe, I have
our passports, let's go.
- Let's do it.
You wanna go?
- Yeah.
- Where do you guys wanna go next?
- Disneyland.
(laughing)
- You don't need a passport
to go to Disneyland, silly.
(upbeat music)
