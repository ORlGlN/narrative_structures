- All right, you guys.
I think it is time we talk
about something a little bit serious.
- We do.
♫ This is our life, this is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream, this is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take the shield and we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life, let's live it
♫ Live it forever
- Good morning.
-  Good morning.
- (laughs) What's up, Mister Horse?
Hey, Ollie, something's
different about your face.
-  What?
- Can't quite put my finger on it.
Looks different though.
What's wrong with your face?
(Ollie shouts)
- Ah, there he is, good morning.
-  Good morning.
- How's it going, dude?
So, today's a fun day because we just
have a whole film crew here in our house.
And Missy's filming something
very special this morning.
This horse is eating me (yells).
Missy's filming something
really cool all day today.
So, Ollie wanted to put on his horse head
and scare everyone.
-  I'll scare them.
-  Go scare, mama, okay?
Scare mama.
(yells)
Got a crazy horse.
- That's so scary.
(Bryan laughs)
-  He's like
going around the house,
scaring the whole crew
with his horse head on.
It's so funny.
- I would say you can't see,
that's what I'm thinking.
-  (laughs) He just
climbed all over that producer.
You wanna go scare more people?
Come on, Ollie.
-  Ollie, can I have a ride?
-  Are you a zombie horse?
-  Getting on my horse.
- Zombie horse.
Trying to keep the boys happy
while Missy is in there
filming some stuff.
I actually lucked out
because it's only gonna be
Missy and the boys on camera.
So, I kind of got to take
it easy a little bit today.
But I do feel bad for Missy
because she's still sore from the rock gym
and she's got a full day
of being on set and being filmed all day.
Well, it's not like we're not used to it
'cause we film all day every day anyway.
The boys were getting a little ancy inside
so we're playing.
That's a cool cave, dude.
- Yeah.
-  Is there anything neat in there?
- No.
-  Any animals?
- No.
-  No, Finn, here, drive up here.
Oh, no, it looks like
Luna got to your car, huh?
-  We were storing it back there.
-  Yeah, we asked for it.
-  Luna.
- Luna got it, yeah.
That's okay.
(upbeat music)
All right, you guys.
I think it is time we talk
about something a little bit serious.
- We do.
- Speaking of, look what
he's doing right now.
- I know.
- Okay, so, this is
what's going on, you guys.
For the past couple of weeks,
Finn has been--
- He's picked up a new habit.
-  A new habit.
And he twirls his hair in his finger.
- It is so cute.
-  It's seriously so cute.
He does it when he cuddles (laughs).
- When he wants to like
relax, just like cuddle.
Or he's getting tired, it's just twirl.
- But it's created a
little bit of a problem.
And I'm gonna show you right now.
- Who who ha ha ha.
-  Are you being a little monkey?
- Show mom how you twirl your hair.
-  Can you twirl your hair?
Twirl your hair.
- No, he's not gonna do it right now.
-  Do you guys see
this little chunk of hair right here?
He has literally created
a huge knot in his hair.
-  I mean, it's like a dread lock.
-  It's like a dread lock.
Oh, and he hates when you touch it.
- I think it's pulling too
'cause it's got so many hairs.
-  It's bothering him.
- If you like do anything
with it, it pulls.
-  Yeah.
-  I can't get it out.
I think there is actually
like grass in there.
-  Stuff in it, yeah.
(laughs) It's so weird.
- And he looks for that
one specifically too.
'Cause he feels it and
he just twirls that one.
- He likes to twirl it, yeah.
So, today,
we are
going to give Finn his very first haircut.
-  Yep.
- It's kind of a bitter sweet day
because he's almost two.
He still has not had an official haircut.
I don't know if this is even gonna count.
- I had a pirate birthday!
- (laughs) But we are
going to cut the dread lock
from his hair now.
- We have to.
-  We have to.
It's gotta go, okay?
It's gotta go, okay, Finn?
All right, Finn, Mimi's got the scissors.
It's got to go.
-  Gonna give
him his first haircut.
-  Ready, dude?
(lighthearted music)
Done.
-  Oh, my gosh.
-  Normal hair again.
-  It's done.
-  It's gone, buddy,
it won't bug you anymore.
Isn't that nice?
-  Put that in his baby book?
-  Yeah.
-  Oh, my gosh.
Baby's first dread lock.
- Look at that.
(Bryan laughs)
This is a big knot, yeah.
I mean, it's a thick knot.
There is so much hair in there.
That's crazy.
- I know, that is crazy, he's okay.
He's better now that's he's
got that out of his hair.
(laughs) Finn is just so funny.
He's like got his own personality.
He's got his own little
habits and hobbies.
And it's so funny.
- I think of him as just like a baby.
-  Yeah.
- Like he's still a baby.
-  He wants to be babied too.
- He just wants to be a baby forever.
-  (laughs) I think it'll be nicer
without that on his head.
- I know, it was actually
really bugging him.
Like, every time I like touched his head.
He'd be like, "Ow."
(lighthearted music)
- Good job, buddy.
Ollie, come here.
What did you just do?
Did you just do a shot?
Are you my little actor, buddy?
(laughs) I love you.
Hey, I love you.
Thanks for being such a good boy.
This is his new hairspray.
It smells like cotton candy, huh?
Here, smell my hair.
Does it smell like cotton candy?
- Ew!
- No, it smells good.
- No, it doesn't.
(upbeat music)
-  Hey, Finn, do
you wanna see the fishies?
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah, the fishies
are doing so good, you guys.
They're just clowning around in there.
(laughs) That's your dad's joke.
- (laughs) I know.
-  I can't steal it.
- Clowning around.
-  They're in
such a good mood though.
They're just chilling out.
Where's Phoenix?
He was just here.
- He just came in here.
-  Oh, he must
be afraid of the kids.
-  I think Ollie
scared him (laughs).
- I see my bud.
-  You see what?
- My bud.
-  Your bud?
- Yeah, my bud.
-  The shrimp is your buddy?
- Yeah.
-  Here comes Kai.
Oh, he's catching some shrimp (laughs).
-  Wait, he's eating shrimp?
-  Yeah, he likes to eat shrimp.
I think he's a shrimp.
(Missy laughs)
There they go.
(upbeat music)
Ollie, what did we find?
- A snake, a baby snake!
-  We got a baby snake.
Kelsey actually found it.
Oh, there he is!
-  Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.
-  Get it!
(Bryan yells)
- That is so cool.
-  (laughs) Ollie likes snakes,
in case you didn't know.
-  Yeah, I don't know what kind.
- That is a cool looking snake.
It is black and it has
a red line at its neck.
People are probably
Googling while watching this
and they're like, "Oh, yeah.
"That's actually the most
poisonous snake in the world."
Missy's trying to put it
in a bucket right now.
- It is a very crazy snake.
But I'm excited to figure out what it is.
-  You want to see it (laughs)?
- I can't get it.
- Where's Papa when you need him?
(Missy yells)
Oh, he went under the concrete (laughs).
That was a cool snake though.
Maybe we'll see him again, you guys.
(laughs) Missy's so determined.
-  What, where is it?
- (laughs) You gotta be
really careful with snakes, right, boys?
- But where is it?
I can't see it, you guys.
(upbeat music)
- So, we Googled it and it's
called Ring-necked snake
and it's slightly venomous.
Although, it's usually like never
like a real threat to humans.
-  What, really?
-  Yeah and it
says they're nocturnal.
So, it's interesting that
it's out during the day.
- I'm so bummed I didn't get it.
- I know, we finally saw a snake
like different than a
rattle snake (laughs).
Look at you, dude, you're
ready to catch a snake, huh?
You know Missy, she can't let nothing go.
- I caught it.
-  She caught it (laughs).
Did you literally just drive up here
to see the new snake (laughs)?
- It's a beauty, look at that.
-  It's really cool, flip it over.
Flip it over.
-  Isn't that crazy?
-  Red, red belly.
- I've never seen a
snake like that out here.
-  I have never.
-  He grew up here.
-  It says they're nocturnal
and they're actually mostly in Florida.
-  I wonder if there's more.
Like, if this is a baby.
- Where's the nest?
-  Yeah, it's
pretty cool though, huh?
-  Is he very fast?
- Really freaking fast.
(laughs) I'm like scared.
And he jumped at one point.
-  Oh, gees.
-  Look at that dark.
- That's a black snake!
Like, if I saw a big one
of that, I'd be scared.
I would be so scared.
-  Yeah (laughs).
- At first, I thought
it was a rattle snake
because of the neck went in.
Or to me, it looked like it went in.
-  The head don't look--
- It's not a rattle snake.
But at first, when I saw it from far away,
it looked like the neck
went in and popped out.
-  Yeah, we're always
finding snakes here, huh?
- Silver head, gophers, and Garters.
-  You caught me.
-  I've never seen a Ringed snake.
- I have never either,
I have never seen one.
-  We're gonna
have to show mom though.
(upbeat music)
Hey, boys!
-  What?
-  It's October six
and you get your candy.
Are you guys excited?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yay.
I want the red one.
If there's a red one in here.
- Okay, let's find out together, okay?
Looks like we got orange and pink.
Which one do you guys want?
- That.
-  You want orange?
Does that sound good?
- Yeah.
- (laughs) Luna's like,
"Hey, can I come in now?"
(laughs) You can come in,
in just a minute, okay?
Give me a minute.
Anyways, we are getting ready for bed now.
It is getting late, I need
to take my eyelashes off.
And take my makeup off and all that.
Bryan is actually out with the boys.
I mean, he's out with my dad,
my brother, Jeffry, Corbin.
So, they're just having
like a fun guys night.
So, I think Kelsey's
gonna actually come over
and we're gonna hang out
and do some fun stuff.
But the boys get the snack on their candy
and then it's bedtime, okay?
Yep, there it is.
(laughs) He's pretty excited.
He's pretty happy, huh?
And what are you guys watching?
(Finn yells)
-  Nightmare before Christmas.
- Nightmare before
Christmas, watching it again.
They're addicted, you guys.
You guys love it, huh?
- They made it for Halloween.
-  Yeah (laughs).
