-  That's the scary dragon.
Ready to fight him over there?
- But--
- Okay, let's go.

- Good morning!
- Good morning!
Good morning, guys.
If you don't know, we are on a little trip
to the Great Wolf Lodge.
Yesterday, we spent the whole day
playing at the water park, huh?
- Yeah.
- Bryan is actually sleeping.
It's kind of still his birthday weekend,
and I thought, let's let
him relax in the hotel room
and get some sleep and
I'll take these boys out.
Get some breakfast in them, and
maybe do a couple fun things
before Daddy comes down and meets us.
We're very excited, though,
it's gonna be a fun day, huh?
(peaceful guitar music)
Finn, who's that?
Is that the wolf?
- Yeah.
(Mom laughs)
- Smile, Finn!
Say cheese!
What do you think of that?
Oh, he says it's yummy.
I just got them their breakfast,
and it's actually a
delicious buffet for them.
They do really good at buffets.
They got lots of food, lots
of yummy stuff for ya, huh?
(happy music)
(clapping)
Finn is very excited to say hi
to Violet the Squirrel, huh?
Is she here?
Go give her a hug.
Aww!
Good job.
Say bye.
- Bye.
- We are done with breakfast.
It was so much fun.
The boys had a blast meeting all
the little tree animals, huh?
- Yeah!
- And what is this, boys?
- A treasure box.
- Wow, that is so cool.
Something really cool they
have here at Great Wolf is
a magic map quest that you can
go on with a magic wand, huh?
- Yeah.
- And he, and Finn, want a wand so badly
so they can go around and
do all kinds of magic stuff
with little things they
have all over the hotel.
I think we're gonna go ahead and go in
and grab them all their supplies
so they can play with their magic wands,
huh?
- Yeah.
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.
- We gotta go pick you out a wand.
I think there's even
outfits they can pick out,
and then we'll go on
our little magic quest.
(fantastical music)
First thing they get to
do is pick out an outfit
and Finn really liked this one.
He thinks it looks like
Harry Potter, or actually,
Ollie likes this one because
it looks like Harry Potter.
And then this one is a little
bit smaller and simpler
so I'm gonna get that one for Finn.
Do you like that wand?
- Yeah!
-  And which one do you like?
Oooh, look at that.
Next, you get to pick out a gem topper,
and they've got dragons and unicorns
and, ooh, they got all
kinds of cool stuff.
Ooh, they even have a cute little wolf.
Are you leaning towards the dragon one?
That one is pretty cool.
(optimistic music)
The boys are ready to
do their magic quest.
Are you ready?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
-  Are you so excited?
- Yeah.
- First off,
they look absolutely adorable.
They got this cute little wizard outfits.
He's got one kind of the same.
Love these little hoods,
that's the cutest thing ever,
then they have a utility belt.
Show us everything that's
in your utility belt, Ollie.
- I got a little--
-  Protection, protection rune?
- Yeah.
-  They each have a
lightning protection rune.
Hopefully that'll keep them safe.
- And then we got a little sword.
-  They got a sword in here.
Just in case they need
to fight some dragons.
Let me see you do it.
(wind rushes)
Careful (chuckles).
And Finn's got one, too,
he's trying to pull it out.
Show us your fighting skills.
(wind rushes)
Good job.
And then, the most important
item of all, you've got?
-  A wand.
-  A wand.
Pull it out, bud.
Wow.
Show me one.
- Watch what I do
with my wand.
- Wow.
- Wingardium leviosa.
(Missy laughs)
-  Good job.
Ollie got this red, fiery
wand, with a very cool dragon on top, huh?
- Fire breathing dragon.
- Fire breathing dragon.
And then Finn over here's
got this blue, icy wand,
with a cool crystal on top, huh?
They each have a game name.
What is your wizard game name?
- Fire Breathing Wizard.
- Oooh, that is pretty cool.
And Finn, do you know your name?
It's Cool Wizard, huh?
- Yeah.
- Are you guys ready to play this game?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- We're going to start
the game at a portal
and it's gonna tell us five
things we have to find.
Let's go start this game.
Ooh!
Tap on the pixie, goblin, or dragon
to begin or continue a quest.
Are you ready?
- Yes.
(soft music)
-  First things we
need to find our these items,
okay?
- Okay.
- We've gotta find these gems.
Alright, so we are looking for
- Found it!
- Three little gems.
Do you think that's it?
Let's see, you can point it at it.
Oooh, good job.
That was really cool but it's not quite
what we are looking for.
We are looking for some blue gems, okay?
Ollie, what's that right there?
-  Crystal.
There it is.
- Wow.
Can you put your wand up
to it and see what happens.
(twinkling)
Wow.
Good job, you did it.
(fantastical music)
(wind rush)
(twinkle)
- Look, I found it!
- Good job!
They are having so much fun.
They actually found something,
I didn't even see it.
I think the game is
technically for ten and up
but I was like, we'll
play and see how it goes,
and they're actually
doing pretty dang good.
We are on a quest to get five crystals.
We found three already, huh?
- Yeah.
-  What colors did we get?
- We got red, blue--
-  And white.
- And white.
- We still need green and purple,
which they say is on the fifth floor
so let's go to the fifth floor, okay?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
-  Do you see one?
-  Yeah!
-  Oh my goodness!
(twinkling)
We found the green one, good job.
We still gotta find a purple one.
- Look!
- Do you see one?
-  You have found
the purple crystal.
- Yeah.
- Yay!
- Wow.
- Wow.
-  Look at all the
dazzling crystals you collected.
-  You've got so many crystals.
-  Well done.
I believe you deserve this
super sparkly dazzle rune.
Have a dazzling day, Magi!
-  Bye!
- We need five items
for the healing potion
and we just found slime, huh?
- Yeah.
- We still need four more things
and they're all on different floors.
First, we're gonna go get Daddy
so he can come help us play.
Sound good?
(Finley whimpers)
Yeah, your cape fell off.
Let's put it back on, 'kay?
(fantastical music)
(wind rush)
- Alright, so the boys had
to recruit good ol' dad
because I know my way around
a magic wand, you guys.
Helping them find their ingredients
for their healing potion
but we just found a sword?
- Yeah!
- What?
Can you get it out?
(Bryan grunts)
Try it, Finn.
(Finn cries.)
(Missy awws)
Alright, I'm gonna use my big muscles
and I'm gonna try, okay?
Okay, ready?
(metallic sliding)
(Bryan groans)
-  Ohhh!
So close.
- It is in there.
Let's see what happens when you wave
your wand at this, boys.
Show me what you do, Ollie.
(Oliver casts spell)
Whoa!
- Ohp, I don't think
that was the right thing.
-  That wasn't the moss?
-  Nope.
(fantastical music)
-  Even wizards need a break, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
-  What are you eating, Ollie?
- A donut.
- A donut.
And I had to grab a hot tea.
I sometimes forget that I
drink hot tea in the morning,
so I didn't even order it at first,
and then I was like, "Oh, I
need that in my life right now."
(fantastical music)
(wind rush)
- It's named moss which
is on the lower level.
And we need fungus which
is on the fifth floor.
-  We're looking
for moss down here.
- And then fungus.
-  Of course
moss would be down here.
Look it, you guys.
It's all ancient and wet and drippy.
Whoa!
-  You have found the
green chest and some gold.
-  Ollie, you found some gold.
(fantastical music)
There is a little friendly
frog over here in this tree.
Do you think he has any moss?
(wind rush)
-  You have found the shadow moss.
- The shadow moss?
-  We found the moss.
Good job, Ollie.
(fantastical music)
(wind rush)
-  You have found
50 gold hidden in my book.
- Ooh!
- Nice.
(wind rush)
(wind rush)
(sprinkling)
Whoa.
That's a pretty crown, huh?
- Yeah.
(fantastical music)
(wind rush)
(birds tweeting)
-  Whoa, Ollie.
Fungus!
- Yay!
-  We found the fungus, Ollie.
- We need the pixie lady in the lobby now.
-  Ooh, we get to
go to the fairies, boys.
- Yay!
- We have our healing potion.
-  Now what are we gonna do?
- We are gonna go see the pixie lady.
- Okay, let's go.
The boys have been working so hard,
they have their health potion,
and now we are headed
to go to the fairies.
I think this is gonna be
really exciting for them.
- Yeah, also we've all kind of
taken a part of Finn's costume.
-  Yeah.
(Bryan and Missy chuckle)
- There's a princess.
-  Yep, wave your wand.
(wind rush)
- Nice.
Pixie and princess.
-  Hello, Magi, I
am so relieved to see you.
-  She's talking to you, dude.
- Really?
(fantastical music)
-  We need this last
rune here called the Enchant,
and then we unlock the pixie.
-  Alright, let's see what we need.
-  The Enchant Creature
rune is truly a wondrous item.
(Bryan ooohs)
(fantastical music)
-  Oh no, Ollie, I found
an evil dark wizard, Carl.
Can you defeat him?
Go get him, defeat him.
(wind rush)
Oh no, he's getting away.
(wind rush)
(Carl fakes yells)
You have been defeated, Evil Lord Carl.
- He's too powerful.
He's too powerful.
(Bryan and Missy laugh)
Now he's breaking out the sword.
- Oh, now he's gotta defeat me.
(metallic clank)
(Bryan laughs)
Now I'm done.
- I think you defeated
him, Ollie (laughs).
We're on the hunt right
now for a silver apple.
There it is.
-  Wave your wand.
-  You now have the silver apple.
-  Nice!
Look, it's spinning.
Now we're looking for a painting.
-  Awesome, you found a piece
of the Enchant Creature rune.
-  Nice.
Come on, wizard, let's get in the elevator
so we can go to the next enchanted land,
'cause that's I'm sure
what wizards are doin'.
We're looking for a paw chest.
We're in the Cryptic Cavern.
Nice.
- Good job, you did it.
-  We need one more piece
of the Enchant Creature rune.
-  Wowee!
You found a piece of the
Enchant Creature rune.
-  I think we
have everything, Ollie.
- Let's go check out the portal.
(fantastical music)
- Alright, Ollie, it is now time
to fight the giant fire breathing dragon.
Are you ready?
- That's the one.
- That's the scary dragon.
Are you ready to fight him over there?
Okay, let's go.
(intense fantastical music)
(growling)
(growling)
(metallic scraping)
(wind rush)
(loud growling)
Oh, he doesn't like that, Ollie!
Cast one more spell at him!
(wind rush)
I think you defeated the
dragon, Ollie, high five!
Whoo!
- Whoo!
-  That was so cool.
What do you got to say to him?
- You should be a nice dragon.
(Bryan chuckles)
Apparently, Momma is a real life wizard,
because she made all of
these magical tickets appear.
Missy's like, I know the system now.
We're hijacking the arcade right now.
- Apparently, they have
four of these games
and I beat every single one
so I have over 400 tickets.
Pretty excited.
This was the game that Ollie
annihilated the last time
we were at the arcade
and he won 1,000 tickets.
Punch again.
So close!
- We have finally made it back home,
and we had such a blast at Great Wolf.
Did you have fun, Finn?
- Yeah.
-  And everyone else had fun?
(all agree)
We had so so so much
fun and if you guys want
