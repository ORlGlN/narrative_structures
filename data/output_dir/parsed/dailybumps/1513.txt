start realizing that because you're
vlogging you are creating memories and
you're actually going out of your way to
enjoy your date or like to live your day
to the fullest because you're
documenting it and obviously you don't
wanna look back on a boring day
obviously there's gonna be days that are
boring but you know what I mean you want
to like live it to the very fullest that
you can so if that means you're sitting
home doing nothing limit to its fullest
I can't even doing it for almost a year

every single day always the thing I say
is like go out there and make memories
cuz you're gonna remember you know I'm
not going to remember sitting on the
couch and watching 12 seasons of Netflix

a lot so I just got done doing the
dishes are actually which was a disaster
I was actually dishes yesterday but I
was so tired that I didn't do them and
then I had a huge mess this morning so
I've been working it like forever I am
actually having a little video chat with
a girl you guys might know her but she
just had a video kind of go crazy and
we've been friends for I think a couple
weeks now and so I'm so thrilled for her
you guys can check out the video below
in the description because it's amazing
I think it's something that's really
close to my heart because Missy and I
sort of tried to express the same sort
of thing but I'm here chatting it up
with Lizzie Velasquez say hi Lizzie uh
so Lizzie has a youtube channel also I
don't know you're like one of the most
coolest people I think I've met online

YouTube oh you find me my youtube name

not knowing I'll never be able to change
it yeah oh that's my name that's so
funny definitely check it out you guys
she did a TED talk at the Austin
conference and it was it was it's just
really cool and I'm I'm sure a lot of
you have seen it but if you haven't go
check it out in the description below
that was so weird I just heard a BP but
I have no idea where it came from I
really did you guys hear it did I press
record Boren it wasn't my phone my phone
doesn't even make that sound
I'm so confused about mice it's just
laying box this month this is my January
citrus 9 bucks and I actually am gonna
be filming the video because I usually
film the unboxing of it to look at it
but it doesn't go up till next week
which means I have to wait a whole week
see what's in here this totally sucks it
like drives you crazy because we get
like a package in the mail you like want
to open it like immediately be like
what's decided I go so it started and
now I have to like wait it looks really
cool though and it's we're like really
heavy and like it's heavy and it feels
full and I'm really excited I really
want to know what's in it like they send
all over the cool stuff every single
month like he loves everything that's in
it so every month that we've done it
he's really enjoyed it huh I don't want
to be over that overly tired but I'm
trying to kind of hey um mate you know
not let him nap too much because he
tastes like lots of little naps like
little 10 15 minute naps which I think
might be also hindering my ability to
get him to sleep at night peacefully yes
we might be starting to get tired
there's no um I've been having a little
bath type dilemma um just that basically
Oliver is growing out of this thing and
I want to put him in the bathtub a lot
of you suggested the laundry basket I
think that's pretty dang cute yeah I
think it's working
I'm afraid so he's back is up against
this and his feet are sort of touching
this so he's sort of holding himself up
to I don't think he'd fall forward like
that you know right now he's got the
hiccups and you're chewing on two
different toys yeah come on all right
you guys take two we're gonna try and
get all agree take three um tonight
we're gonna put Ollie in his crib to
sleep tonight until the first wake up
yeah
thankfully get him started in his crib
at least which is a really hard thing
okay what what emitters crib I know very
like emotional I know but at the same
time I'm like I need my own room see
there he's gonna be in here or I'm gonna
be in here no you know what I mean I
just hate that like we have to tiptoe
around him when he's in our room cuz
like we hang out in our room it's not
it's like our living room too you know
yeah it's just I go closer to six months
that's when the chances of SIDS actually
goes down a lot you still playing Animal
Crossing yeah are you giving up on Super
Mario I don't have really hard part
oh really
but I'm really enjoying animal crossing
right now Austin I blame you
thanks a lot Austin was tweeting about
jack-in-the-box I guess at nine and they
started this thing called the Munchie
box which gives you like a choice of
sandwich to tacos and like calves he
fries with a drink and I was like okay
and she was like complaining while she
was trying to get Oliver to sit she's
like I am so starving cuz all we woke up
late and we just dilly-dally around and
all we did we went to lunch with her
family and then we kind of haven't eaten
since then so we're all kind of hungry
so I'm running to Jacquelyn box to get
food but this thing is so funny okay you
guys want to know how picky Missi is
this is what she gets
she gets the homestyle chicken club
sandwich right but she doesn't order it
like how it's on the menu she only gets
the homestyle chicken and the bakery bun
individually like all a cart with no
mayo
and a chocolate Oliver oat cake that's
like her favorite thing to get I just
think it's so fun like it's like 9
o'clock I'm in my pajamas and I'm headed
to Jack the box so thanks a lot Austin
well now bathtub time is really fun to
clean up look at all that so baby is
asleep in his crib and I gotta tell you
I've been in there for over an hour
maybe even close to two hours now trying
to get him to go to sleep it was like
really rough okay like I had a screaming
baby like that but I got a secret to
tell you I got into sleep using Katy
Perry I know it's so bad but at the same
time at that point I was desperate I
didn't want to pick him up and comfort
him because I knew that if I picked him
up it would help but I just had one Shh
so finally I just let him lay in his bed
just like he is right there and I put
Katy Perry on the other side of the crib
and he fell asleep to her maybe I should
just put my phone underneath his bed and
put it on KP repeat I like a sound app
or we just bought it so if F and B on
it's like this little thing it hangs on
this craving it's got like a sounds but
so far he's just listening to a sound
thing and it's working someone see how
long you'll stay asleep one of my
favorite songs on the radio you guys
something beautiful need to breathe
awesome song go check it out if you
haven't seen it I just realized the
lights that on so you probably can't
even see me
look at this cutest face ever but of
course extremely guilty face huh ever
since uh Brian started making him seem
on the floor he gets so guilty when he
lays on the bed he's like hey you're not
supposed to play just really just I I
missed the bed okay
I missed the bed you lookin he's so
funny you tired baby boy he just seems
like such a different dog these days
yeah probably has to share his attention
with ollie
okay so um Ollie slept for like 45
minutes which is actually pretty good
that's like more than a nap if it was an
avid be good yeah so um tell us what you
just went in there and did Missy yeah I
put it I put my iPad under his bed and
then I just put Katy Perry war on repeat
it totally worked he was screaming and
then I literally heard the song he's
like hey well lately that is hilarious
hey but we have a problem I've had the
12 percent Welsh's plug that junk in Oh
