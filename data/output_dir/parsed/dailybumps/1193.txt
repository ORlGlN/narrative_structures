my anaconda don't want none unless you
got buns hon
good morning guys how's it going today
we've got some stuff going on Missy is
peeling and quartering apples
I am 1/16 168 today making a homemade
apple pie peeled and cut by hand
yep last night we have the great idea
that today we are actually going to do
our turkey Thanksgiving dinner with
Missy's family tomorrow on Thanksgiving
we're gonna be spending it with some
other family and we want turkey we love
Turkey so we were like let's cut the
turkey and it was my guys birthday over
gone over it yeah that's true you see
your son right now
Missy oh he's pushing around this fondue
basket and he flipped it over and now
he's climbing on top whoa whoa okay
you've had your adventure kid let's stop
trying to hurt ourselves okay good
morning karma so anyway last night I
actually went and I bought everything we
need for Thanksgiving dinner one of the
things that we need for Thanksgiving
dinner is rolls we do these amazing
Rhodes rolls every year they are to die
for
I thought they'd want to take longer to
rise than they actually did so he
started it last night and woke up to
this they rose so much they actually
flattened it was just way too long so I
don't know what we're gonna do also we
got a turkey somewhere is it out here
let's go check the turkey
Missy put it in here to some overnight
with some water and I think it's good I
don't know why she has a pan in here Oh
probably to keep it down cuz it it feels
squishy the turkey feel squishy yay it
worked so yes today is gonna be a fun
day I've got some fun dishes planned for
Thanksgiving
we're gonna be doing lots of cooking and
celebrating with family so you're
basically getting a Thanksgiving vlog on
Thanksgiving yeah yeah you're welcome
check out this apple pie filling it is
basically cinnamon and sugar and flour
and brown sugar all kinds of good yummy
stuff it smells amazing it actually
tastes pretty good too this is going to
go into the pie crust and in the oven
and it's going to be a Dutch apple pie
it's going to be delicious and let's say
I'm getting this all done earlier as
much as I can done early so that because
I'm actually going to go paint and
Brian's doing majority of all the work
so this was my responsibility and I'm
pretty much pretty much dead in yourself
your homemade crust right yes I I made
my homemade crust right in here oh crap
right did it work
oh it sank okay I didn't have time to
make a pot homemade pie crust okay oh my
pie crust that you made earlier yeah
there you go this is that like too
convenient but I really like my pie pan
so I took the pie crust out of it and
put it into my other pie pan but
apparently that doesn't work because it
just basically sunk right into the pan
we are at the house and we are going to
start painting right now the walls are
very flat white and we're going to paint
them this really pretty it's just like a
cream color and the reason we chose it
it's kind of a plain color but we the
other color in the house is a brown we
feel like it'll really like kind of
brighten up the house with this cream
color and also it will match because
obviously we don't wanna do something
totally different than the brown but
basically all night taping everything
off and everything's pretty much flat
wall so I feel like it's gonna go really
fast
I just need to do this thing which is
actually pretty uh
curvy and got all kinds of little holes
and indents and I even got to get up on
top of this thing and paint up there we
still haven't done any of the edging so
I sent my mom to go get the flat edger I
just think it works so good and really
easy to put it on so I'm trying to get
all the first coat done before she gets
back because she's getting that and us
some lunch because I totally forgot I
haven't eaten anything today I have been
playing some Super Smash Brothers the
new one for the Wii U Toon Link is where
it's at he's my new favorite character
you see I played a little bit last night
I don't know if she was really liking
the game um probably because I kept
beating her she's not really into
fighting games - but she was having fun
just been getting some stuff done all he
takes a nap but he just woke up so let's
go see his smiling little face little
baby hey kiddo
wanna help daddy do some shopping today
I gotta grab some stuff before we start
dinner
I started our rolls over again texted my
mom and she's like yeah those won't be
edible like cuz they fall because they
like fell after they rose they'll just
like not cook correctly I guess so we're
starting those over hey what do you do
it
go on the motorcycle ride
go ahead push it come on push it over
here come here can you push it you won't
hold it down oh just like precedent
short burst it's not fun er he's like no
that's funner it must be nice to just
get to see a start do a little bit and
then all of a sudden we're done even
though we've been working for like hours
but we are all done with the second coat
on the living room and I love it I think
it turned out great this good thing
about this paint is that because it
blends like so well with like the white
it's again my mom is like it's very
forgiving like you can't really tell if
the blotches because it kind of just
blends in with white so I'm really
really happy with how it turned out and
I think it looks really pretty even
though you guys probably can't really
tell the difference when I like go like
this but you can tell like that was what
pretty much what it looked like and now
it's kind of this creamy vanilla color I
gotta say all you are a great shopping
buddy you know that we got everything
last second that we need it for tonight
so pretty excited
you did good huh - you look what we got
going on I got duck in the pan you guys
i he is a big bird he is a beast I have
never cooked a turkey before in my life
so I'm going off of Suzanne's recipe
which is basically just rub olive oil
all over and seasoning salt that's what
you do every year and it's amazing so
that's what we're doing okay so there's
my turkey and I had to pull his neck out
that was fun I walked it he's like I had
to pull his neck out of his bottle they
just dump it in there why did he stuff
his negatives bottle that's not fair I
just roasted some garlic for my mac and
cheese that I make in and it's all going
in here you want to put it in there babe
oh good
push him head push him in awesome tell
you guys dinner in 10 hours
yeah did I tell you guys about the time
when my mom made this beautiful turkey
set it up on the table like cut it all
up and then our dog boo ate the whole
thing the whole turn if you think it's
all over turkey was gone and there she
is roasting away ladies and gentlemen
Missy is making a pie crust yeah she
tried to get out of this and you guys
remember this morning her other pie
crust sort of fell well she baked that
pie crust and then when I went to go to
the store karma found his way on top of
the stove and ate it
yeah yeah so it was kind of like a sign
from God that you just need to make your
own pie crust right yeah um I'm not
really sure how to do it so hopefully I
do have a pumpkin pie in there so that's
okay too
just got the pie crust in here it's been
sitting in any fridge and now I
basically put it in here I'm like really
nervous about it I don't know if I've
ever actually made homemade pie crust
before so that is my streusel topping
that will I'll sprinkle on top and then
it'll be like the topping to the pies
okay so good taste an apple mmm
is it good do you like apple pie oh my
gosh I'm in in Turkey what very
delicious look at this bird like this
bird yeah that will go oh it's good
uh we got marshmallows going here as
gravy here he's making some fancy
macaroni and cheese I'm really excited
oh and look at this you guys sing a song
my anaconda don't my anaconda don't want
none unless you got buns hon look at
these butts look at that and put two in
one so it makes a little butt and these
look perfect this one's a little bit
burnt but I don't look at that well you
know this is parmesan and mustard powder
I threw the mustard powder in there to
make it smart you know thinking ahead
and then five cups did you order them
why you better my achievement huh why is
it in this oh I ran out of plastic bags
and so I just took the box and was like
that'll do I don't know why you didn't
think just put it in one of our many
many like you know pots or dishes or
something but I figure everything will
be in use in the innocent Thanksgiving
in our first place and like we don't we
don't plan for making like an eight
course meal for six people be buggin
