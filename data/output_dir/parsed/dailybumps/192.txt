-  Let's see.
(gasps) Is he still sleeping?
Oh, oh, where is he?
Where is Ollie?
(Finn squeals)
Get him!
(gasps) Peekaboo!
(Finn giggles)
(gentle, theme music)
♫ Wherever you are
♫ That's where I wanna be
♫ All it took was a laugh
and that soft sunset
♫ Big, blue eyes looked up and said,
♫ "This is home."
♫ Just foolin' around,
you never looked so cute
♫ Huggin' you tight,
cuddling all I could saying,
♫ "I am home."
♫ Home's wherever you're with me
- Good morning, guys!
Don't worry, I will not
let that annoying chipmunk
start the vlog like he did yesterday.
If you don't know what I'm talking about,
watch yesterday's vlog.
So, today, we put both
kids down for a nap.
They both took amazing naps.
And we were able to get
a ton of stuff done.
But little Finny woke up first.
(lightly taps door)
(Finn yells)
You want out?
Oh, Finny!
Whoa, look at it, you guys.
His nursery is like a club, it's so funny.
Turn that off, turn this off.
Turn this off, how do you turn this off?
There we go.
Turn this off.
(gasps) Oh, hi.
Good morning, cute, little boy.
(Finn whines)
Say, "Hi."
- Hey.
- Can you say, "Good morning?"
(Finn whines)
That's his mumbling good morning.
'Cause he's very tired.
Did you have such a good nap?
- Yeah.
- I missed you.
What do you want to do today?
- Mama.
- You wanna just go see mama?
- Yeah.
- He always wants to go see mama.
Good morning, Finn.
And good morning to you guys.
(Finn babbles)
Really?
(Finn babbles)
Okay, alright.
- Alright, Finn is up from his nap.
And he slept so good.
And you know who else slept so good?
Ollie, they both went down so good.
They didn't cry, they just went to bed.
And now it's time for
Ollie to wake up, huh?
You gonna go get him up?
He's been a little clingy to mama.
(gasps) Let's see.
(gasps) Is he still sleeping?
Is Ollie still sleeping?
Oh, oh, where is he?
Where is Ollie?
(Finn babbles)
Get him!
(gasps) Peekaboo!
(Finn giggles)
(laughs) Did you have a good nap?
You slept so good!
Good job, I love you.
You guys both did so good.
Yeah, they slept so good.
We were able to get so much work done
while they were sleeping.
It was nice.
I told him he didn't have to sleep.
I just wanted him to have
some time to rest in his room.
And he was like, "Okay."
And then he just fell asleep.
Guess what we get to do, guys.
- What?
- We get to go see Uncle Corbin
and Auntie Kelsey's new house.
Do you guys wanna go see their new house?
And go play with them?
-  At Meme and Papaw's?
- (laughs) No, not at Meme and
Papaw's, at their new house.
Ollie actually thinks that
Corbin and Kelsey's house
is the house that we stayed at in Oregon
when we saw the eclipse.
So, I've been telling him
that they're moving here.
And he's like, "They don't
have their house anymore?"
But he's never actually been
to their real house which is funny, so.
Yep, we're going to their real house now.
Because they live here now.
-  Hey, Ollie.
- What?
-  Where are we at?
- Kelsey and Corbin's new house.
-  Yes, we are, aren't we?
And look at you boys.
(Finn babbles)
(laughs) The boys are already exploring.
We're checking out the new digs.
- What do you guys think?
- Oh, my gosh, this is amazing.
-  This is so cool.
-  Thanks, yeah, I love it.
- It's actually happening, you guys.
Our friends have moved
from Oregon to California.
And we're so excited.
I'll let you guys watch
their empty house tour.
I'll have the video of theirs,
linked in our Icard today
so you can check it out.
But yeah, we're here
exploring their new house.
Whoa, that is really cool.
It's really nice.
Ollie, where's June?
- I don't know.
-  Is she sleeping?
Gotta be quiet, huh?
Do you like that she lives closer now?
She's gonna grow up and you guys,
maybe, are best friends together.
That's kind of cool.
Then you can have lots
of cool friends, huh?
- Yeah, but where did
Kelsey and Corbin go?
-  I think they're
still exploring upstairs.
(gentle music)
What did you just find?
-  A little, tiny, baby lizard.
-  That is so cute.
Look at how cute it is.
-  Aw, it's so little.
- You can't have it.
(Bryan laughs)
-  Aw, it's his
new friend (laughs).
-  Whoa, that's cool.
- This kid is crazy.
He just dropped it 'cause
he wanted to catch it again.
Be nicely though.
-  Pick it up nicely.
'Cause his tail will fall off.
-  There you go.
-  If he gets scared.
-  There you go (laughs).
- Does he bite?
- No, you're good.
(gentle music)
-  Hey, Finn,
do you like her outfit?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, 'cause she's
wearing your old clothes.
That is so cute (laughs).
(gentle music)
Missy and I have a plan to get back
at Corbin and Kelsey for pranking us.
(growls)
And we're gonna test it out
on the boys first, right?
Okay, so we have these gorilla suits.
Look at that, that's so creepy.
And Missy's gonna hide in the closet.
The boys are gonna come in.
They're eating dinner right now.
So, they're gonna come
in to get ready for bed.
And then, you're gonna
jump out of the closet
and scare them.
- Okay.
- Wait, we need a code word.
The code word is going to be bananas.
When you hear me say, "Banana",
that's when you jump out, okay?
You got this, babe.
Oh, yeah, that's freaky.
They're gonna love that, okay.
Okay, good luck in there.
-  Okay, bye.
(laughs)
- Okay, I'm going.
(Oliver giggling)
(laughs) Come on, Ollie.
Come on, Finn, it's time
to get ready for bed, okay?
(growls) Look at these cute,
little kiddos in this mirror.
They're so cute, aren't they?
Aren't they so cute?
You guys are like a couple
of cute bananas, aren't you?
(Missy growls)
(screams)
(Missy growls)
Who is it?
It's Mama (laughs)!
- (laughs) His face was terrifying.
-  Really?
(screams)
And now, he's laughing.
- Wait a second.
Is that funny (laughs)?
His face was so funny.
Did you get scared?
- No, are you wearing a gorilla?
- Isn't she a good gorilla?
What do you boys think, was that scary?
- Yeah!
-  Hey, Ollie, do you think
that would work on Kelsey and Corbin?
- Yeah.
- Should we scare them?
- Should I put on a suit too
and then we scare Kelsey and Corbin?
They got monkey suits.
So, I have one and Missy has one.
And I think we're gonna get
back at Kelsey and Corbin.
Because when we were with them
for the solar eclipse, they pranked us.
You don't prank us and get away with it.
So, now there's a couple of scary gorillas
that are coming after them, right?
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Mama, I will distract.
-  You're gonna distract them?
- Yeah.
- Perfect.
- The tables have turned.
♫ I'm dressed as a gorilla
- (laughs) That's a pretty cool gorilla.
- What do you think?
Is this a good look for me?
- That looks really cool.
- Do you know what this
hair on top reminds me of?
-  What?
- June (laughs).
Doesn't it look like her hair?
-  Uh-huh.
- So, I am in the gorilla suit now.
And we have a plan.
- Yes.
-  Missy's gonna
pretend to see a spider
and she's gonna yell at Corbin.
- Huge spider right there.
-  There's huge spider, ginormous.
- (gasps) Spider, Corbin!
Come get it, come get it, it's so gross.
Oh, my God, it's so gross.
It's so big, it's so big.
- It's just a spider.
How big is it?
-  Just get it.
It's fine, it's fine, just get it.
It's so freaking big and nasty.
It's so gross.
- I don't want to.
Oh my, what the!
(yells)
Oh, my God.
(imitates gorilla noises)
(yells)
-  Got you, bro.
I remembered the silly string.
-  Babe, what happened?
-  Got you.
- That freaking scared me.
(laughs)
Spider.
-  Meditating Ollie is back.
Oh, my goodness, you are so funny.
He's trying to get in zen mode right now.
(Bryan blows tongue)
