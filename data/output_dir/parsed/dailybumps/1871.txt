brag that they didn't use the filter but
then there they usually look at cup oh
where are we going oh I'm thinking wings

me to share to Facebook and Twitter okay

a real rainforest but you're working
with what you got so well it still ends

I liked your photo um I was a little
concerned when you wanted to tag trees
yeah it's good sometimes people refer to
marijuana as trees
and if all I had was my camera if I was
left in the car and all I had with a
hammer what would I do

wrong oh wait you would unlock the doors
