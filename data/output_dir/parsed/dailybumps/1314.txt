a day before your birthday buddy son
baby is a boy he's gonna new amazing
things which we have a button on the end
slate or there's always a link below in
the description so one year ago today
Missy was like having troubles feeling
him kick he wasn't moving a lot and he
was basically in distress it's amazing
to see how far we've come
you know I know a lot of people probably
you know came to our channel at
different times but basically I mean for
the longest time we were struggling with
Missy just staying pregnant you know we
lost two boys two boys and it was is the
most like traumatizing thing that I
think ever happened to us and I think
like you know we don't like to talk
about it a lot but it's something we
seriously will never forget we will
always remember how it felt no Missy got
pregnant with this little guy and it was
like just an insane miracle insane that
he made it because she hadn't felt him
for so long and now like you're here
with us huh I love this little guy good
put some of this organic whole milk in
there for Olly I'm just gonna let it
soak up a little get a little bit soft
shake his whole face in that puddle of
milk it was drinking it he's eight
almost his whole cereal which he never
does you got milk in your hair buddy
yeah got some choco chip Eggo waffles
for me
you I love these things and I'm in the
rest of always man you're done you ate
everything buddy I just gotta clean you
off now huh like I will take those now
these Eggo waffles are so simple and I
just eat them plain I just think they're
really good plain okay you still want
something all right guys I just ordered
all these cakes mash and I'm really
excited because I called around to a lot
of places to see if they would do like a
healthier cake but in the end I was like
he's not gonna eat very much of it it's
such a little amount it's doing like
they're doing like a whipped cream
frosting which is kind of I guess a less
sugary than like they're butter creams
and stuff like that so I'm trying not to
worry about it
this is his one-year birthday I'm just
gonna let go and let him have fun and
eat some cake they're gonna make some
good pictures Brian yeah I'm excited
