and all he is right now down for his nap
and we are trying to get out of the
house by the time he wakes up because we
have a couple things I do and
and we have meet my company today so all
I can hang out with his cousins and so
before all any wakes up from his nap
when I make him a green smoothie so
because he's sick and he's been not
eating as well I think this is like
super important first we're gonna put in
this vanilla yogurt for him it's gonna
help with protein and all that good
stuff help get something good in it I'm
going to be on it so the smell of yogurt
makes me so sick and then a little
coconut water again protein and then we
just gotta add all the veggies in fruit
and then he'll have a yummy yummy green
juice when he wakes up from his nap I'm
gonna be honest there's all kinds of
good stuff in this thing I think we have
yogurt coconut water a little bit of
this mango carroty juice stuff I don't
know strawberries carrots apples banana
oranges spinach ice there might even be
a few more things in there that I don't
remember I pretty much just threw
anything that looks yummy in it and this
is a big smoothie and it will actually
he'll probably eat one of these for
lunch and then he'll have another one
for dinner and it might even go into the
next day we've got Ali's sippy cup for
right now when he wakes up and I've got
this one these serve as like sippy cups
right here so this is like four
different smoothies for him so this is
pretty awesome this is laughs that's

things that we're gonna be doing is
there's a nurse practitioner over there
that works with a lot of the people of
Cambodia and they can't get borax and
this really helps them they are just
like a cleaner right yeah but if they
have skin conditions and oh yeah for
them and then also she also can't get
