huh he woke you up with tickles we are
munching on some food from last night

some little sandwiches and how are the
the hit of the night which was the
Montecristos and she left some uncooked
so I just threw him in the oven yeah and
I'm gonna dust my powder sugar and sear
it and I would saw that was like the
craziest rudest thing I've ever heard of
but it's actually really good
we're gonna eat a meat what okay
it is Christmas over at Mimi and Papa's
and we're together you guys I'm sorry I
was busy yeah we went to London so kind
of like if we didn't do it before then
you do it like at the last minute and
she didn't do it before so we are now
going to decorate their Christmas tree
which is obviously going to be a family
affair we've got all the Christmas
decorations in a very very old box like
it's from 2000 and pretty sure I
decorated this when I was a kid how old
was I yeah I mean come on decorated this
together I was 11 years old
I show this probably every single year
I'm pretty sure this side is mine and
then this side is Jimmy's because it
looks like crap so obviously I'll tape
it up and don't throw it away yeah I
know there's like tape like all over it
like this this thing is broken but how
could you throw this away can't ever
throw that away so we are gonna decorate
oh yes my mom grew this out in her
backyard we just chopped it down
just put it back oh yeah I recycle it
yeah every year she like waters it all
year make sure it stays alive um anyways
we got the Christmas letter that we have
to read which is always a really big
deal and I always get really nervous
because I have to write it every year
and I usually forget and then I'm like
oh crap I should have done that forever
ago so I hope it's good this year I
don't ever remember doing it but I know
I did so that's
you play on some cars yeah what did you
get it auntie gave you cars today yeah
so what did you do I just gotten access
doors
so you went Christmas shopping with
auntie then I was yes we got the
Christmas tree all decorated and he's
ready to put the start maybe you and
Finn can do it together huh yeah yeah
cuz I feel like Finn really wants to be
involved hyung you want to put that star
up maybe you can show him how and then
he can do it after you okay feel like
we've had this star for like years mom
Oh remember maybe I just keep your
claisen I'm pretty sure this is the same
one this got holes in it pretty sure
it's the same star that I put on when I
was a kid but not obviously like that
but it is definitely been around for a
long time we are making dinner right now
and we're making beef stroganoff so
excited I'm actually super hungry I
barely eaten today rummaging through
your heart I'm I just need to play with
something pushed away yeah okay so every
year I know why this is my job but I
write a Christmas letter for the
following year and we've been doing this
since I was a little kid the reason I
get around little kids because I wanted
to be fair on who gets about the star up
on the tree because every mirror it just
seems like it's always Jimmy's turn but
like no there's gotta be a system here
it's problem I turn one of these years
anyways nothing I write I wrote like a
letter and then at the NSA and by the
way it's Misty's turn to put the staff
to the next eight years it was Missy's
term no we keep all the letters I still
have like a lot of them now it's not so
much about putting the star up because
it's probably always turning like every
year now or at least until Finn's old
enough to do it but it's always still
fun to do water so I am in a box
Merry Christmas 2016 2016 seriously
these years go by too fast lately the
days even go by too fast we are always
running and going I hope we are starting
to slow down if not I hope
taking event of all our opportunities
and truly living life to its fullest
every year I write these letters and
every year life is so different from the
last someone's moved a new family member
career etc this year I suspect big
life-changing things to take place
giving recently took a possible job in
opportunity in Chicago and we are all
nervous about that Cassie is heading off
to Cambodia and then hopefully college
next fall
my hope is that Cassie makes good
decisions and finds her passion in life
Jimmy and Cassie are the best auntie and
uncles that I could ask for for my kids
and only wish the best for them every
year I worry about that in his life
career but I see him finally retiring
Hey to be free from all those drinks his
job put on him physically animal flash
dad is doing this more than I I wrote
this why make is negotiable I'm not I
can't hear I said dad deserves this more
than anyone I know he has thought only
it's okay where were you I know my dad
is great okay um dad heard this more
than anyone I know
he thought I've only his family for
years we love you daddy don't we get you
so much mom you were the best and dad's
biggest supporter and motivator I didn't
know how I would do it without you
you're all of our support and best
friend Thank You Bryan
I love you so much oh wait wait Scotty I
love you too
me for so anything is you talking to
bride no wait let me read that part so
much and can't believe the lies we have
made for ourselves our kids in our
family I love me more than already I
expressed all you are becoming so big
and I'm so proud of you I truly wish I
could freeze time Finn my littlest baby
I can't imagine how big you are walking
maybe say a couple words I can't wait to
see you turn into a little boy
Merry Christmas family I love you so
much into a little boy what does he know
hello frog it was a really crazy year
like so much happened like when dad
like I'm over every year writing this
letter and always just being like I
guess just like dad's just like the
years go by so fast because dad was
working like every single day and we
never got to spend time with him and
it's just a lot and it's just crazy that
now eat it doesn't keep me just get to
spend time together and I like this
really cool what I love most about these
letters is that you always like
predicting the future yeah I think that
you basically just proved that you're a
witch maybe everything but that you want
to catch a good decision you know what
also also I have a hunch that Missy
wrote that last week she's like every
year I got to get on my production work
in your garage you put the ramen I
didn't write this anytime student I
don't know exactly when I wrote it I
literally always forget I do it on
purpose um when I write this letter and
be done with it but when did you
actually retire everybody
so I mean I wrote it in January so we
were probably like talking about and
thinking about it for a while so yeah
it's not like it's totally apart but oh
look at this baby's first Christmas with
ollie
mm whoa your head is so big it's
touching the ceiling Ollie all right put
the star on you know what to do there
