- So that prank kind of backfired on me.
I tried to Super Glue the
coins to the concrete,
and I just got Super
Glue all over my kids.

(Finley shouts)
- Good morning!
-  Good morning boys!
How are my boys today?
Did you catch some fish?
- Yeah.
- Whoa, that's amazing.
- I'm hungry.
- You are?
Well, it is time to eat breakfast.
Should we get our breakfast on?
- Yeah.
- Pound it.
(imitates explosion)
There was like a little
tiny explosion that happened
when you hit Dad, did you
know that? (laughs) (mumbles)
(upbeat music)
Alright we are getting the
boys some cereal this morning.
- Yeah they want Honey Nut Cheerios.
Gotta get the milk.
Are you guys excited for your cereal?
- Yeah.
- Me too.
Can't eat cereal without your spoons, yay!
-  Alright boys.
- We've got cereal.
Dig in, dig in.
-  Eat your cereal, okay boys?
(silly music)
What's wrong with it?
-  What happened?
- It's freezed!
- What?
- It's freezed?
No it's not.
- Take a bite--
-  Ollie, we
just poured the cereal,
just grab your spoon.
- Fin just pick your spoon.
What the?
- What?
- What the heck?
What's happening?
-  Fin what
happened to your cereal?
(Fin babbles)
(Bryan and Missy laugh)
-  Ollie, you can't take a bite?
-  Is yours the same dude?
Pick it up.
- I just poured this, what happened?
Oh!
- Oh, there's some came out.
-  Oh good, we can eat some.
-  I don't understand
what's happening here.
- Okay wait, what's today?
- Easter.
- It's Easter,
but it's also April Fool's!
-  April Fool's!
-  April Fool's!
(Fin babbles)
- Yeah you guys can't eat
frozen cereal. (laughs)
-  Isn't that funny?
-  Look at this you guys.
This is like for real frozen cereal.
(Fin babbles)
Fin's determined, he's like,
"I'm gonna wait til it
thaws and I'm gonna eat it".
Aw, jokes on you, Mama's got
real cereal for you boys.
There you go Finny.
Alright take a bite of
your normal cereal Fin.
(kids babble and mumble)
Yeah, I know you have that one,
and you have that one, huh?
-  But how did it get freezed?
- So last night Mommy and Daddy thought
it would be really funny to
make you guys a bowl of cereal
and then put it in the freezer,
and then pretend to give
it to you for breakfast.
(Fin babbles)
Isn't that funny?
(Bryan laughs)
- At this point, Missy,
we're just pranksters
teaching our little
pranksters how to prank us.
- Yeah, I know, right?
- So we really do need to be
careful today. (both laugh)
(happy music)
Hey Ollie, whatchya got here?
- A Venus flytrap.
-  No way, and what's in it?
- There's a spider and a fly.
-  That's crazy.
Is he eatin' 'em?
- Yeah.
- Ollie is so excited
about Venus flytraps.
We found a dead fly in the windowsill,
which we put it in his mouth, huh?
- Yeah.
- And then we also put
a spider on top of it,
and then it closed and ate it, huh?
- Yeah.
- That's the spider.
-  Don't touch it!
-  I won't touch it.
And then that's the fly.
What do you think about that Fin?
(Fin babbles)
You've gotta be careful,
do you know why Fin?
- Yeah?
-  'Cause the plant could eat YOU!
(Fin screams)
Mama broke out the chocolate.
She must be up to something, huh Ollie?
- Mom, what are you doing?
- Well, I also need a chocolate melter.
What should we do with melted chocolate?
- Make make chocolate chip cookies.
- I mean that's a good idea too.
(Bryan laughs)
- Look you guys.
It's our old Christmas
cage in the background.
For this next trick, or prank,
I'm about to do on the kids,
I'm gonna need some coinage.
I never carry actual coins,
but just found Missy's
purse, so I'm gonna raid it.
Come on babe, pull through.
Oh yeah! I knew it.
(coins clink)
Missy always has coinage.
You know what you guys?
It's April Fool's Day, no one is safe.
(laughs) She's gonna kill me.
Oh wait, I should put it
in the coin pouch too.
Just to make up for what I took, you know?
How's that you guys?
- Mom, where's your purse?
- Oh my gosh, Bryan, this
is a really nice purse.
-  Well, I thought I
put really nice animal cookies.
Is that okay?
- No, no it's not okay.
-  (laughs) April Fool's!
- See, you just do anything
you want on April Fool's Day.
And you just call it a joke.
-  (laughs) I filled Mama's purse
with animal crackers, isn't that funny?
- Why?
- He's so confused.
He's like why would you do that, Dad.
- I've been trying to explain it to him.
He's like I don't get it.
- This is great actually,
because Ollie has no concept
of what a trick or a prank is right now,
I don't think, so he
will fall for anything,
and this next one I have
is gonna be a funny one.
Alright I'm gonna have
the boys come out here,
and I'm gonna show them this
new Spanish lavender we planted
but I want them to go for these coins,
so I'm gonna drop them, and
see how they fall naturally.
And now I'm gonna glue 'em.
(silly music)
Ollie, Fin, I have something to show you.
Daddy has new Spanish lavender
outside in the courtyard.
Do you guys wanna go see it?
- Yeah.
- You guys
like lavender right?
Okay, let's go check it out.
Alright, let's go boys.
Come check it out.
So we put 'em in both
of these pots down here.
Spanish lavender.
Does it smell good?
- Money!
-  What'd you find Fin?
- Money.
- What?
Grab it!
- What?
How did it get here?
It's sticky!
- Oh, ah.
Oh is it stuck?
Oh it didn't work as much or
as good as I wanted it to.
(laughs) Daddy was trying
to play a prank on you,
and it didn't really work.
And Fin's like, "Yeah, it didn't work."
Oh Fin, don't rub your hands!
Come on, come on boys.
So that prank kind of backfired on me.
I tried to Super Glue the
coins to the concrete,
and I just got Super
Glue all over my kids.
So, babe, I tried to play an
April Fool's joke on the kids,
and the Super Glue did not stick
to the concrete and instead
it stuck to their hands.
- Oh my gosh,
so (mumbles) you got glue on you?
- Yeah.
- No, don't do that.
Are you sure?
-  It was probably
just a little bit,
but we need to wash their hands.
There you go.
No more April Fool's jokes, okay Ollie?
- He's like, I don't get this day.
- We won't do any more today.
(dings)
Dry your hands off boys.
Sorry about that.
- Daddy's so silly, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, I'm a little silly.
Alright, I think we are on
our second April Fool's fail.
(laughs)
- Yeah, I was like--
-  The Easter Fail, what is this?
- I thought that this was
seriously gonna be so fun and easy
but I cannot get this chocolate.
-  We're trying to
make giant chocolate eggs,
you guys, and we cannot get
it to pop out of the shell.
It's just broken.
- Like I've got a thick one,
I've got a thinner layered one,
and it's just nothing.
It doesn't, it just, this is what it says.
Just hold it over, and flex,
and it should just pop out easily.
No, it doesn't happen.
-  So this is what
you're supposed to do
if you get 'em all made properly.
It's supposed to make a
giant chocolate Easter egg,
which it kinda does, that's kinda cool.
- I think I can save the day though.
(upbeat music)
(silly music)
(door creaks)
(playful music)
- Ollie, Fin, guess what?
Mom and I just saw the Easter
Bunny in our living room,
and he's got a job
for you guys.
- He left these
for you guys, look it's Mickey Mouse.
-  That's so cool.
- Cat Boy!
-  Cat Boy?
Fin. (Fin babbles)
So that's your Easter basket,
and you guys wanna go get some eggs?
- Yeah.
- Alright let's go.
- Okay, let's go find eggs.
You can't open 'em 'til we're all done.
You find 'em and put 'em in your basket.
(happy music)
(kids mumble)
-  There you go.
-  Wow, you're making--
-  Fin, come here.
Fin come here, come here.
Look at this one.
Careful.
What's going on in it Fin?
Don't open it, just put it in your basket.
Is it vibrating?
- Yeah.
-  Ollie found a giant one.
(happy music)
Nice find, dude.
Ooh it's really in there.
The boys got some super
cool Easter eggs, huh Ollie?
- Yeah.
- That's so neat.
And look what else the Easter
Bunny brought you guys,
two giant chocolate eggs
with more goodies inside.
Do you wanna open those later?
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's count
how many you got.
-  Yeah count your
eggs boys, how'd you do?
- One, two,
three,
four,
five,
six.
-  Nice.
- And seven.
- Yay!
-  Ollie got seven eggs.
And how many for you Fin?
(Fin mumbling)
-  There's four, five,
-  How many'd you get?
-  Six, he's lining
them all up, he's so into it.
-  Seven, is that all of them?
- Oh nope, two more.
-  Ooh, eight.
You've got more than Ollie?
-  Yeah, so
Ollie, Fin has more eggs,
but your eggs are bigger.
- You got big ones, but he got more.
-  Isn't that cool?
- I got little ones and big ones.
-  Yeah, alright, should we see
what's in all these eggs?
- Yeah.
- Okay Ollie, you get
to open up yours first.
This is your chocolate egg.
- This giant chocolate egg.
- Can you open it?
- Whoa!
Why did you get me broccoli?
(Missy laughs)
- What?
- Why there's broccoli?
- What?
Why is there broccoli in there?
-  There's broccoli
in your giant chocolate egg?
- Get it out!
-  Well Ollie, you
know rabbits eat broccoli.
So--
- Yeah, does that look good?
-  Alright Fin,
let's see what's in yours.
He's like, I hope it's a burrito. (laughs)
Whoa!
What'd you get Fin?
A pepper?
Let me see.
- A red pepper,
and a yellow pepper.
-  And what's that Fin?
- Peppers are spicy.
- An onion.
-  An onion?
- Smell it.
- Eww
- He licked it.
-  (laughs) Well,
Fin don't you know,
that bunny rabbits,
they like peppers and onions, and stuff?
Alright boys, April Fool's!
- April Fool's!
- We got you.
- He's like I don't know.
- He's like
this is not an April Fool's Joke.
- I got a giant egg of chocolate,
okay that's enough chocolate,
that's good that's good.
-  That is awesome,
look at all this broccoli in here.
Alright, time to open up all our eggs now.
The boys are going for the gold one.
- What is it?
-  Put it on the
table, put it on the table.
- Oh that's so cute.
- What?
It's like a little hamster.
That moves, that's so cool.
Whoa!
I love that!
-  Oh my gosh,
Kath would love these.
-  Yeah, that's so funny.
Fin, there's a big one in here.
- Can you get it?
-  Open it up.
Ooh, what'd you get Ollie?
- Legos.
- Legos?
What'd you get Fin?
Oh, anchovies!
- Anchovies, ew!
-  Oh wow, okay this is happening.
Oh gosh, are you actually
opening this, babe?
In our house?
They're little fishies Fin.
- Do you want some?
- No.
-  No, he doesn't want those, babe.
- Ew.
- There, smell em.
-  No anchovies? (laughs)
Are you okay babe? (laughs)
- I don't wanna smell it.
-  (coughs) My
bad, didn't take it away.
- Sorry about that.
- April Fool's!
- He's like, can I get something real?
-  Go for it, open it buddy.
Dinosaurs?
Wow!

- I got a Ring Pop!
- What?
- What?
If you guys did not know,
Ring Pops are coming back.
The kids love 'em.
Open this one.
- Ew!
- Mushrooms!
What?
- Why did you get mushrooms?
- I don't know.
- This Easter Bunny
is crazy.
- You know why he got mushrooms?
Because it's Easter and April Fool's Day.
-  (laughs) Candy!
I want this one.
Fin made out with the dinosaurs,
and you got a Ring Pop so you
don't have to seal Ollie's.
Ooh you got more Legos, Ollie?
- Yeah.
- That's so cool.
Hey you wanna see what's in this one?
Oh, a Kinder Egg.
And Fin, look what's in
this one, another one!
Alright Ollie open up this big one.
Let's see what's in it.
What is it, what is it?
Ooh looks yummy.
-  Is it candy? (laughs)
What is that?
- Carrots.
- Carrots?
Or is it meat?
(Missy and Bryan laugh)
Worst.
Easter.
Ever. (laughs)
Alright boys, you can have all the candy.
Daddy will take all the mushrooms
and vegetables and stuff, okay?
(upbeat music)
- Look who's over now, it's Pey and Liv.
We have been having such a fun day,
now Peyton and Olivia are
over, and we're actually
gonna do some more Easter stuff.
Okay so we thought it'd
be fun to have a little
Easter egg hunt, with the
girls, since they're here.
And so me and my Dad are
out here, setting up eggs.
Oh look a perfect spot for one.
How cute is that?
(upbeat music)
We've got a really loud one in here.
(egg vibrates)
Hey kids, do you wanna
do an Easter egg hunt?
-  Yeah!
-  Woo, get down here!
Pick your Easter baskets.
So you get the pink bunny,
and that looks like a blue little sheep.
And you got Cat Boy, Mickey Mouse.
Are you guys excited?
-  Yeah!
-  Okay, on your marks,
get set,
go!
(happy music)
Kids are going through all their loot now.
Wow, you got lots of eggs.
- (mumbles) A lot of eggs too.
-  You've got a big one.
(screaming and laughing)
Did you get lots of eggs?
-  I got a giant one too.
- Whoa, good job.
Did you have a good Easter,
you little Easter Bunny?
It is so late now, the kids
had so much fun playing today,
playing with Pey and Liv, and
just being with the family.
But something we've been trying
to figure out is honestly,
what does this bunny actually
represent for Easter?
And I don't even really
understand Easter eggs either,
but it's a tradition, and
that's what we keep up with.
But yeah, so now the kids
are passed out asleep.
Bryan's actually working on the video now.
I was like, oh no, we
need to end the vlog.
So I am going to end it right now.
Make sure you give this
video a big thumbs up,
and let us know down in the comments below
what is a really good April Fool's prank.
Let us know down below,
and maybe we will use it for next year.
We will see you guys tomorrow.
Happy Easter everyone.
Bye!
