moose after being taken down from Ali's
room Ashley broke and so now my dad set
up a little area so they could actually
smash it ready

I come again
morning good morning guys always sneaky
buying because of a beat yes guys yes
oli is very busy playing dinosaurs good
morning guys welcome to gear five five
years ollie
we're on year five babe and it's
starting out on a sour note
this is organizing all of our kids cups
glasses mugs everything because we get
just got new cups for both the kids
because they know what they both like
now and we found something really cool I
was actually at the vlog like 10 minutes
ago because I found something really
cool a glass from our comm it says prom
son Simon mastery and it was just like a
really amazing night and it was
something that I always change it's just
like one little memory from that night
and I want to show you guys because just
like officially 10 years old yeah
and so I set it down and then I was like
thinking about how we're gonna have that
forever like I'm just going to be an ink
you doesn't play better if you like this
is from our problem 2007 and then I
kicked it on accident and it should team
up you can see a little bit of it there
it is and midnight mass grade prom 2007
yeah we're not going to have that for
every song it's gone okay
typical laughs I didn't really think too
much about things and that's like and we
are not hoarders and we do not like
flinch at like throwing stuff away we're
not using it like we like to not have a
lot of stuff but that was one thing
that's been in our kitchen for a long
time like it's from our home yeah these
are really cool night tonight sorry babe
no too bad we don't have a blog from
that night huh their pictures and we
recreated some of it in the who new
music video when we were in the car and
you put on my boat I remember that as
kilo all I need to tell you guys
something what do you need to tell
you wanna tell me we were hot we were
seeing palana and songs about Woody from
Toy Story yes I am just so surprised at
him still okay all he is is growing up
so fast
he's now singing along to song
memorizing songs singing them on his own
I always just assumed like that stage of
fascination would go away with your kids
but they just keep learning new things
you just keep learning new things kiddo
you know you even dressed yourself this
morning huh that's pretty cool and Ben
loves to dance
so we have a little dance parties in the
morning huh yeah I know you like that
song huh Luna are you in Ali's room they
excited me I need me to exam yes this is
your bedroom actually just recently
moved the chair a little closer to the
door because we're trying to slowly get
them used to us not sitting in the
rocking chair while he goes to bed
and we're just kind of doing this like
slow process yeah so now it's just like
randomly in the middle room I know after
a night like oh she paid we forgot to
put her out what happens when you have a
puppy I'd rather put her out I should
have put her out and I was just you all
right now I'm gonna go clean that up
all right Luna you just go and change
he's a really great training session had
like two training sessions and
super-smart we want to take advantage of
her smartness yes thing is that because
we travel and have sort of hidden stuff
like that and we already have two other
trips coming up I don't want to like
jeopardize jeopardize her right now
she's soaking it all in
she actually are friends with the
trainer he's like he's kind of like
knows like our family really well and he
wants to take her to his house and train
her there that way you can soak up as
if you can and come back and and then in
turn keep teaching us how to do it all
come back like hopefully not buy any
kids right now unfortunately thing is
like you can't really play with the kids
figure out happy create kind of easier
this nothing so crazy because you have a
really hard decision for us because we
love human Tibet it's the best thing you
can do though for puppies it's the board
training just does so well so I'm
excited to see the type of puppy she's
gonna become huh yeah and we'll see you
soon
we'll see you in just a couple days okay
see you wanna go outside play Thank You
behalf of your dog all right yeah
totally yeah so they're taking Molly too
so they have each other these are the
resources they're basically just going
off the doggie camp okay
yeah Molly will be joining them because
they play so well together and we have a
big property we just want all our dogs
to be as trained and a smart as possible
thank you thank you
yeah he was saying like there's
rattlesnakes and there's coyotes out
here and listen if they don't like
listen right away and they're jarrandi
and the point of having a dog is to
protect us all so we want to keep them
safe as well we don't want them to be
hurted and get hurt and it's over all
right Luna you're going away to camp run
away to camp just war if you did okay
new to Molly to money and karma made you
the camp two afterwards but Wolfie he's
such a smart dog he's been doing the

behind but I have like 500 these badboys
design and huge announcement I now have
a brand new music video up on my channel
for the song ropes and it's such an
emotional song and emotional music video
it would really mean a lot if you guys
went and checked it out showed your
support because it was it was hard to
film it was definitely hard and
emotional to film a huge music video
there's some crazy underwater scenes
crazy emotional scenes between Missy and
I and we just kind of put our all into
it so please go check that out link down
below the description go out to any
music video so we have been working all
day and is now nighttime a little
stressful right knocks were actually
headed out or no get some food with the
kids because I haven't going to go shoe
shopping in a while but the chickens
have been out most of the day and I want
to see if they put them all put all
themselves back to bed I'm gonna go
count and see how many are in here
alright I just got electricity put in
here but it seems to not be working so I
turn on my phone there's one two three
four five oh there's one more over here
Heidi six alright one two three four
five six we got all you guys in here so
I'm not locking up so you know one gets
yeah it is actually super important that
I make sure that they're locked up at
night because we have coyotes literally
sometimes in my eye sound like they're
in my yard and it's so scary so luckily
this coop is very secure and very safe
for them but I have to walk this out
like if I left this door open I don't
think it would be good I mean he may not
come around there's one specifically a
coyote that comes around and sometimes I
can even see him and it's really scary
so you gotta lock him up in here no
nothing get some clothes this one too if
he knew that they were like like they're
chases open at night you would get them
in a second but he doesn't probably know
that they're actually open they're
secure now good night chicken you're
safe all right you guys all he really
wanted to show you what he can do now he
said daddy I want you to vlog you gonna
show me okay go not as easy with socks
