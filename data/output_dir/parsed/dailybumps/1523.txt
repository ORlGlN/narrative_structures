good morning guys I got from the future
it's not the future zombie it's just the
year 2014
whatever same thing they're selling
brains in the supermarket yet
Oh
I think some of those okay this is our
son baby
boy do amazing things good morning you
guys it is 2014 the very first day of a
brand-new fresh year a new me a new vlog
I knew you a new dream a new goal I'm
starting the new year off right you guys
I'm doing it I'm just gonna start off
right it's bright and early and I am
getting Donuts
none mmm look at those doughnuts look at
those Leo's how can you deny those
doughnuts good morning guys
say good morning Ollie are you gonna get
ready for the day what are you gonna
wear so cute today he's actually in a
really good mood last night went okay he
slept but he would only sleep basically
on me so um which I try and keep him in
his bassinet as much as possible and he
just every time I put him down he was
just heard screaming so I just I think
he just needed mommy cuddles last night
huh me not so good I like I sleep but
when he's sleeping with me I don't sleep
very well I sleep very like
uncomfortably because I'm just like
worried about him and so Oh kinda what
are you doing like rolling himself in
all his clothes anyway I'm pretty
exhausted David he's actually in a
really good mood huh she's getting so
big
I watched actually one of our vlogs
right when he was first born this
morning I was just like oh my gosh I
can't believe how little he was and how
big he is now it's just crazy and now
it's 2014 huh and this year you're gonna
turn a year old I only have a couple
goals for the year 2014 and I'm gonna
say goals and not resolutions okay here
are my goals for 2014 I want to be
funnier I want to laugh more I want to
make people laugh more I want to just
step up my game this year I want to
probably not eat as many doughnuts when
I buy doughnuts that's good
I'm going to throw that out there that's
a good goal I really want to just try
and enjoy the little moments with my son
and my wife just a little bit more
we often get like really caught up and
like the rush rush of the day and what
we need to do next and stuff and and I
think just that idea just you know
sitting with them and peace and quiet
and just like enjoying their company
just a little bit more as well I think
that should always be one of my goals
look how cute you look he's here in his
adorable sweatshirt which I actually
showed you guys on my haul video as a
Carter's haul video I put out on Monday
so he's wearing that and then these cute
little like um mrs. texture called it's
a corduroy like they're like corduroy
pants thank you hang on Oh doesn't me
how you'd look you look pretty much
adorable you knit so adorable ah so this
morning when I got doughnuts they had
this thing called a cronut and I've
never had one before let me know if you
guys have but I guess it's like a
specialty thing um and it looks like
it's got like cream filling in it but
it's like flaky and but I remember
seeing a Byron Talbott do a recipe on
his channel about it and so I was like
oh I'm gonna try it and it's like quite
possibly when your favorite doughnut is
this doughnut I don't even know I'm
gonna try some of this cafe if I'm Nuala
they sent me over some little samples
when I ordered let's get that going and
good morning karma hi how are you this

hey little cutie Hey hahaha are you
ready to shoot a video I'm gonna shoot a
video with him for my channel so is it
up there today yeah it's up there right
now so after you guys are done watching
this you can go to the description and
click the link for my new video
something you wear on your feet and it's
really airy mostly we're doing like the
hot season and yes gang or good we still
got taboo out say one of the words was
he do it I dare you I was like I love
this game
I have been slacking so much these past
two old days and I didn't do diapers and
I'm because basically we had disposables
available and I took advantage so um
yeah I was just being really lazy but I
finally did him and you look really
clean and they smell good so I just need
to put them in the dryer and then we'll
be back to class I know when that
temptation is there you want to take it
but I really enjoy cloth diapering and
low that I don't have to spend the money
I don't have to go and buy go out and
buy disposables I have cloth diapers um
and I like that they're just enough I
just like a lot a lot of things about
them I've done a few videos about it but
um the work can be a little annoying and
when you have a temptation of disposable
I take it and stop looking at Katy Perry
we trying to shoot a video that's why I
changed my shirt but he's not having it
yeah your video
oh no bun not cool
Eddie yeah you need to not babe just
give them a nap baby take this off you
buddy you're wanted back on set in 30
minutes okay okay hey listen to me the
talent we have to work with you guys so
needy so Oliver has not taken a binky
for like a few weeks now and it's
actually even like really sad because I
won it's kind of an easy thing to do
when he's like really really upset I
just said put him in his room for a nap
I just grabbed the nearest binky because
he was like screaming and he's totally
going to town on it not it's not the one
that he normally uses like nobody uses a
man and that's a I forget which one that
is but one of those just like the nipple
kind that's like ground and he loves it
he's like totally fine so I think he'll
actually nap is that that in his mouth
and he seems pretty content it's like a
miracle
I know I'm really happy I'm so happy
that you it will just sit in there maybe
fall asleep
Allie finally did it he was in a good
enough food to get the video done um it
wasn't we were trying to do a different
style the light is like about to go down
really just it in time but he got his
nap and then he was in a better mood and

bit different style but um we just went
a little bit easier and it worked out
good so now we're done and yeah he's
