- Good morning on three.
(Bryan laughs)
-  Let's try that again.
-  Good morning.
- Hey guys,
the boys needed a little bit of a do over
with that good morning, didn't we?
- Yeah.
(ding)
- Hey, look what they're wearing today.
What are you guys wearing?
- I'm wearing the tribe
shirt that says Daily Bump.
-  Daily Bump, that's us, huh?
- Yeah.
-  And Finn, who's on your shirt?
- That's me and Finn.
-  That is so cool.
Look at that you guy's
in dinosaur costumes.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- The boys were so excited to wear
themselves one their shirts today.
We have a really fun day coming up.
Lot of big things
happening inside the house
and Missy actually just
got back her DNA results,
and I think she wants to share
them with you with her mom
because it was pretty interesting.
But yes, welcome to today's blog.
Let's have some fun.
Today is kind of a bittersweet day,
because it is the day we finally
take down all of our
Christmas decorations.
(family exclaims)
We have enjoyed our house
being so Christmasy,
haven't we?
- Yeah.
-  Are you gonna be sad it gone?
-  Now we gotta take
down all our Christmas stuff
including this monster of a tree. (laughs)
- You just have to wait
like 11 more months
and we can put it up again.
-  11 more months till Christmas.
- Yay.
(laughter)
- Yay.
(bright music)
- Alright, there is so much happening
at our house today, you guys.
So much going on today
and we're so excited to show you later.
And we're excited to see ourselves.
- It's gonna be cool.
- Totally, but we are
taking a little break
in the middle of the day
and we are taking the
kids to go see a show.
We're gonna go see Annie.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so we have a couple
of friends in the show.
Maddie is in the show,
Maddie's dog is in the show,
it's gonna be a cool time.
- Yeah.
And it's like a play.
So I'm really excited.
I think it's just like at a high school,
kind of like a chill one,
but I think it's gonna be fun.
I always loved Annie.
- I think it has a pool.
-  You think what?
- I think it has a pool, actually.
-  Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- It doesn't.
This one little lion has
passed out on the way there.
That's cute, huh?
- Yeah.
(bright music)
-  Ollie, who you waving to?
- Aunt J.
-  Auntie, yeah, everyone's here.
-  Hey.
-  June's getting
some papa time. (laughs)
We are all sitting and we're
so excited to see Annie.
It's a hard knock life. (laughs)
- He's never even watched Annie.
- I know.
You're gonna love the music, dude.
You know there's singing
and music and stuff.
Isn't that cool?
- And you're gonna see Maddie.
- Yeah.
-  Finn, are you finding all
your favorites in the cast?
- Yeah.
- Do you see Maddie?
There's Maddie.
-  (laughs) He's so
cute looking at it like that.
(audience chatter)
- How are you enjoying Annie?
Is it fun?
- Good.
We're in intermission right now.
Bryan actually just took Finn home
because he was like I'm done. (laugh)
well, Finn was.
And so we do have a lot
going on at the house
and so we're doing a little intermission,
eating some candy.
I'm even eating some candy too.
We're gonna go back in and watch the rest.
It's actually really good.
I'm so surprised.
(applause)
(upbeat music)
(cheers and applause)
(cheers and applause)
We just got back from Annie,
which was really, really good.
I was actually really impressed,
but we have some big changes
that just happened in the house
and I'm so excited to show you guys.
-  Should we show them?
It's right behind the camera.
- I'm looking at it right now.
- We got a new entertainment system.
Check this out, you guys.
You remember what was there before?
That little entertainment system.
This thing is massive.
- Yeah, the other one was super cool,
super cute,
but we needed something
a little bit bigger,
had more storage space and just--
-  Look at this.
-  A little more built in.
-  This is crazy.
And it's not done, that the thing too.
A lot happened today so all of this
is kinda built in to the walls now,
which is nice.
So it kinda just looks like
it belongs with the house
and then we have the nice
farm doors in the front.
- So it's the same color
now as our other cabinets.
It has the same molding
as our other cabinets.
Obviously a lot more storage.
Yeah, so we're pretty excited about it.
- It's so cool and this was
a really big decision for Missy and I.
Missy's really attached to the traditional
entertainment center stuff and I dig it.
- Really good at compromises.
- Yeah, it's like a
cool mix of both worlds.
And I got a new TV.
I got a new TV.
So we now have a 4K TV, finally.
-  Everyone's waiting for this,
'cause we can't watch it.
- This is the best part of
when you get new technology
is peeling the plastic off the surface.
-  Had to get a chair.
- Had to get a chair.
-  Here we go.
- So I could reach up here,
'cause it apparently wants
me to do it from here.
(boys shouting)
Ready?
-  Yep.
(peeling)
Look at that.
- Oh wow.
-  Wait, wait, I
get to do the other half.
Oh shoot, no.
I didn't want it to move.
- Voila.
-  Oh wow, look at that.
- This is a lot more plastic than
what they put on your cellphone.
-  Yeah, a little more satisfying.
- I am amazed, this is crazy.
We've never had a TV look this good.
We've always bought the
cheapest TVs we could find
and now I'm like I want something cool.
So we can watch some good movies,
it's mostly Youtube actually.
-  I love it.
So we gotta put all the decor in here,
kinda fill it up.
We do have a lot more that's
gonna be happening with this.
- Yeah, we have something
else that's happening,
we're gonna keep it a secret though.
Stay tuned.
-  Stay tuned to see what
changes with the entertainment center.
But yeah, we had a really fun day.
My parents actually were like
we're craving chicken gnocchi.
So they went down to get
us some Olive Garden,
so we can all eat some yummy food tonight.
-  Dude, what do you think
of our new TV and entertainment system?
-  Good.
-  Is it pretty cool?
-  Yeah.
-  You wanna watch lots
of cool movies on here and
have family movie nights?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
(Finn giggles)
- Oh no.
Finn, you have to put it up
your nose if you want him to stop.
(Finn giggles)
- Ow.
I think you won.
-  He found another way.
-  Auntie just put it up her nose.
- Hey, i just put it up
my nose and he was done.
(laughter)
(Ollie giggling)
-  Now what are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
-  Ollie, you
gotta put it up your nose.
- Grab it, put it in your nose.
Put it in your nose.
Put it in your nose.
-  Here it comes.
-  Put it in your nose.
- Put it in your nose.
(family sighs and laughs)
- Kids are finally in bed,
they had such a fun day and
were out like that. (snaps)
But before today's blog
ends I wanted to share
with you guys a really cool clip
that I filmed for 23andMe with my mom.
I'm pretty excited about
some news that I found out
and so I'm gonna go ahead
and roll that clip now.
Did you know human DNA is organized
into 23 pairs of chromosomes?
Which is how 23andMe
came up with their name.
Your DNA is who you are and 23andMe's
personal genetic service was created
to help people understand it better.
You'll be able to see where
your ancestors come from
and learn how your DNA influences
your facial features, your hair,
your taste, your sleep and so much more.
It also connects you with your family,
you can learn more about
the genetic connections
that you share and see
what makes you, you.
Our 23andMe results are finally in.
And so me and my mom are gonna share them
with you guys right now.
We have not seen them yet.
I am so excited.
(bright music)
Alright, I'm sitting here with my mom.
- Hey.
- (squeals) And we're so excited.
- Yeah, for sure.
- I was always told that I had
a lot of Native American in me.
- Yeah, Grandpa's mom was Cherokee,
that's what we heard,
but we also know that there's
an adoption in there somewhere.
I dunno.
- Should be interesting.
And what are you expecting to see?
- A lot of English, like British,
because my grandfather
emigrated over from England.
- Wow, okay.
Mine says 100% European.
- Oh, I am also 100% European.
- So I'm mostly British and Irish.
- 52% of that is British and Irish.
- That's almost exactly mine.
- But I thought that
you had a lot of German?
Hollister is a German
name and so I thought
that there might be some German in--
- But that might be
the adoptive people so.
That might be an adoptive
last name, so crazy.
That is so much fun.
I feel like we're gonna
have such a fun time
comparing our DNA together.
- Yeah, going through all
the little bits and pieces.
- There's so much that
you can learn and see,
which I think is gonna be really cool.
-  Be sure to head
on over to 23andme.com
or check the link down
below in the description box

- We're gonna get back
to comparing our DNA.
