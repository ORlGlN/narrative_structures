good morning guys we're gonna go get
Olly and he just woke up from a nice
long Navin ething it is great what are
you doing did you sleep so good
maybe some of those hey baby
boy he's gonna do amazing things he just
woke up from a two-hour nap I'm so happy
although we did miss swim class but I
just rescheduled it for just tiny bit
later but he's not and that's the good
part huh it's a good baby he actually is
sleeping so good in this crib I really
feel like this crib has made a huge
difference because little do we know
that he actually is a really big mover
when he sleeps like he literally fought
from this side to this side in a matter
of seconds while he's sleeping and I
think that because he was in the mini
crib it was hindering him from being
able to move as much as he wanted to and
then he would just get upset or
frustrated cuz he's bonked his head so
easily and he slept for so long yeah you
love it hon
we're gonna be late well we're not gonna
be late but then we gonna get there and
we have to like get him ready actually
Brian's gonna go swimming with him at
this time just because he hasn't done it
and I actually really don't really feel
like going swimming today you're gonna
go swimming at them you got to put him
underwater I think Brian's a little bit
nervous about it it's it's hard do you
want to do it right you don't want you
cuz if you do it wrong technically you
hurt him so thank you
now they have them in this little
contraption and the point of this is to
help him learn his center of gravity do
use him to float with like feel the
feeling of floating without someone
holding him kind of thing and kind of
like at that point see that's kind of
what that little contraption does and it
keeps him in a laying down more like a
laying down position than in like up and
up in upright position the column into
upright positions is it teaches them to
be up and down them they need to be
learning to swim and I'm more like a
laying down trying to climb out
all right you guys we are headed into
target you know what that means they've
got the big red balls don't you think
it's weird they have these big red balls
out here yeah they want some say your
hair looks really cool yeah how long
that take you looking at some swimsuits
cuz we're gonna be going to Florida and
like what is it less than two weeks babe
look at this one's got anchors on it oh
you can find like a sexy one piece right
oh that's cool yes kind of looks like
the shirt you're wearing now I need to
find a new swimsuit too because I owe

and orange one that I got like three
years ago
Lucy's three years old I need a new
swimsuit for Florida because we're going

couple pairs of shorts and I'm all set

like a two-week thing can take forever
for her to pick one we're trying us so
hard to keep all of her up right now

two really good naps a day and he's got
like maybe 20 30 minutes until his next
nap and he's falling asleep on the way
home

radio for the Internet
I was on the crew Cicerone show and he
interviews like entrepreneurs and
solopreneurs and amazing people he said

people but I was on a show and I talked
about YouTube and stuff so if you guys

sleeves up at least two hours me and
karma I'm gonna cuddle I'm gonna take a
nap I love this dog so much I have a kid
now so it's like we have a different
type of relationship because before we
were so like it was just like me and him
like he was like my main focus but now
that I have like a baby he's not my main
focus but we still have this really
awesome relationship taking a nap I'm
really really hoping for two hours I'm
actually just planning on just keep
going back in there and making him sleep
for two hours and then I would say if
that happens like that'll be pretty
awesome because then his next time that
he sleeps will be bedtime and we'll just
be perfect I feel like if this works our
schedule could really like work out like
this so I'm really looking forward to it
hoping these days asleep and I don't
have to go in there too much and fight
with them too much let's not fight Ali

this Friday night and I'm headed to go
hang out with some friends at a poker
party she's like looking stuff looking
at stuff for the nursery his monkey is
only 9 bucks why is it only $9 I don't
know from $60 maybe it's true then today
we got a new terabyte hard drive this is
a 4 terabyte hard drive because this is
all our hard drives right thank you this
red little light that means that it's
running out of storage that was an odd
sound this is a 4 terabyte and I have
two I have two terabytes and 1/4 and I
basically just have to keep upgrading it
but I don't know what we're gonna do
about this whole storage thing because
this thing is getting full and it might
be start to become impractical to
actually keep all our original footage
what do you guys think we should do
because I know like I don't think
shaycarl keeps any of his original
footage but I know like Charles Trippy
he keeps all of his original footage and
I don't know if maybe we should start
using YouTube as like the main storage
thing what do you think so scary you're
deleting all our footage yeah all right
buddy daddy's leaving he's not happy in
that thing where's Ali angry this little
monkey to go to bed got that you're bad
