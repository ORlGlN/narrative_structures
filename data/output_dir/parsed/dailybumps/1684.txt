beautiful day you know what I just
realized

conversation you guys were talking to us
and we talked to you
so leave in the comments below how are
you feeling today what's going on you
know are you struggling with something

know and I'll try and respond to some I
got bumper dance on radio we're on baby
watch right now you guys could happen
anytime we're just trying to prepare
ourselves mentally and have the hospital
back close to the door and I will gotta
say guys we actually shot a video when
Missy is telling everyone she's in labor
and we have it up on her channel but it
will only go live as soon as we're on
the way to the hospital so we're on the
way to the hospital I'm gonna like just
jump on my phone make the video live so
you guys will know right away when she's
in labor on her pregnancy channel the
bum song away which you can really
subscribe to in the link in the
description so that's really really
exciting that we actually did that good
morning everyone
so
he's going to be a fun day I've got lots
going on it's so hot like and really it
hasn't been that high I mean I would say
90s and that's not even that bad for the
round here but now that full term I
think that I'm just really starting to
feel that whole pregnant during the
summertime which is nice though because
at least it hasn't been like the whole
like summertime that I've been miserable
it's just the last couple weeks and so
that's kind of nice and I just realized
Karma's got this toy out I know if you
guys remember um a few days ago a few
weeks ago we actually got this from a
subscriber and this he has still has not
torn up
he usually grabs him and just tears him
up but there's a few toys that he will
just sometimes hold on to and he doesn't
want to tear them up and you know just
play with them you don't want that one
to get thrown away because you ripped
all this stuffing out yeah we're doing a
little learning with karma I don't know
if that's the right word but let's see
if you can do it so he's got all his
toys lined up and we're going to ask him
karma can you get your frisbee where's
your frisbee karma get your frisbee
good job boy good boy okay let's try
another one
we have to put away the frisbee
otherwise he just keeps going for it
okay Carm are you ready for the next one
all right
karma get your snowman all right he's
going on
that's not your campaign interest oh man
karma this is your snowman right here
okay here he just doesn't know what to
do are we playing or not
he's usually better than that but he is
a little bit sidetracked today aren't
you karma by the way if you haven't
noticed already yes me and my sister are
wearing the same shirt and she looks
like you turn it but like it's so funny
because I bought much this shirt like
forever ago and the other day she was
wearing her shirt and I was like why are
you wearing my shirt and then we
realized that she went shopping like a
few days ago and bought the same exact
sure as me and she didn't mean it and
she's wearing a small and I'm wearing a
large and so now I actually didn't mean
to we just ended up wearing the same
shirt today oh we both have braids too
so I am out braving this heat with my
family I think I'm gonna get my eyebrows
waxed
which is like the best place ever
oh that was a fun experience yeah my
eyebrows pretty much hurt really badly
and I think I'm swelling over here but
I'm not like super impressed but that's
okay I got it done at least and that's
always the hardest part is actually
going there and doing it so just got off
work and I'm at the brewery with some
guys but this brewery is so cool look at
all these barrels they got going on and
they have like huge things over there
and they have this big ole miss machine
I'm not sure why any a Miss machine but
it's pretty cool Missy has got the whole
Katniss braid going on do you know that
she doesn't even know you guys I've seen
the movie her Katniss braid so that's
cool I also noticed the eyebrows guys
that's our that's a good tip out there
if you know your wife is doing something
with the whole face or hair or something
make a mental note to look at it you got
to mention it you guys if you don't
mention it then you're in trouble
she made me almost cry oh do you
remember when we did that the threading
all man when we first started this vlog
we did threading and miss you got her
eyebrows so I had to try it out and it
was the worst thing ever and then we
were doing like this dare week and I
actually got my eyebrows threaded I'll
see if I can find the videos and put it
in the description but you should go
look because they're hilarious I am
making dinner tonight and I got my
chicken all pre-portion down so I'm just
defrosted that but I'm gonna do a little
uh just some noodles with sauce and so I
got some littell noodles some cheesy
ragu which is actually like a light
alfredo throw in some chopped red pepper
which I love and then maybe spinach I
love baby spinach it's got a lot of iron
it's super good too super food and I
just want to say a lot of people been
telling me that I should use my fitness
pal and I just want to say My Fitness
Pal isn't actually very good because the
food that's in the system has been
entered by people who use it and so it's
not 100% accurate and actually you can
watch a lot of YouTube videos like I did
of people showing like the difference
and you know when you're counting
calories and like grams of fat and stuff
like that those things add up and so I
would highly recommend the lose it
because they actually work with with the
brands
and like the restaurants and stuff to
get the accurate the accurate
nutritional info all right miss usually
does this I know that's weird that Missy
is the one who cuts my belt over but she
does it cuz she likes the smell of it
which actually Oh smells so good I love
fresh bell pepper all right Oh so I'm
just outside playing with Karma he is
just loving this backyard I really we
all are we're just so so happy with this
house in this backyard and karma just
gave me his ball to throw for him Oh
okay ready hey yeah I want to let you
guys know though aya I often talk about
someone on YouTube her name is Sarah
Louise
I'll have her to her channel linked
below
she's like exactly the same amount of
weeks as me she's probably like one week
ahead of me actually and she's just like
this cutest girl that I met on YouTube
and we talk all the time and she's had a
lot of issues through this pregnancy a
lot of high blood pressure and whatever
and so the plan was that she was
actually going to be delivering him
tomorrow but she's actually delivering
him right now so I'm so excited and so
nervous for her all the same time I just
can't wait I'm praying that they have a
safe delivery but I can't wait to see
him he were both having boys so it's
just been really exciting getting to
have like a friend through this
pregnancy that's like the same amount of
weeks and we kind of experience like the
exact same things at the exact same time
but if you guys want to check out her
channel she I mean she's about to have a
baby so if you want to see her baby you
guys should go check her out alright so

her bum day and she reveals something
really funny about peeing while you're
pregnant and it may be hard to
understand so she's going to give you
guys a demonstration okay so I kind of
tried to describe it on the bump date
but I'll show it to you now this is
going to be a little weird ok I'm not
and I'm gonna actually goes back okay so
this is how I do it so of course it's
own toilet it's really embarrassing it's
so funny though it's and so weird so in
order for me to get all the pee out and
for it to actually like come out I have
to do this hey Pharrell you really have
come down that low yeah I have to
literally go like this then he comes out
and I'm like it's so uncomfortable so
painful my belly he's like I think he
gets squished too cuz it like leaned up
against the toilet I was like oh wow
there's a little pregnancy TMI for you
guys I was major T mine I didn't know
what it was like my pee yeah well I mean
they're following someone who's pregnant
you're gonna get a little TMI sometimes
it's just the truth of the matter her
lopsided right now you see it yeah
hopefully he stays exactly in his
position if not you could just turn a
little bit before we guy here
he actually didn't run away when I
started the camera
oh it's cuz you're like giving him this
amazing my shy huh look at him Oh - the
stuff we also got this one down here
Claire bear Claire Claire bear Clarence

karma stared him down Claire don't get
too chizzes about it all right little
bear now you gotta be up here for
protection
I was like oh if you guys don't know yes
our cat's name is Claire yes he is a boy
Missy thought he was a boy and so our
girl who first got him and so named him
Claire then we found it was a boy and
now he's he's still Claire bear we all
get that question when we say his name
they're like everyone's like Claire is
it Anna boy so yeah Claire's short for
Clarence but not really still Claire
bear you still a Clary Berry's always be
your Claire bear he he goes around the
neighborhood and he's like hi my name's
Claire
he doesn't talk what are you talking
about
to all the other kitties like they all
mean like hey my name is Bella and he's
like my name's Claire and then they all
look at and make fun of huh and after
how much drugs did you do but when you
witness this I didn't what did I just
imagine him when he meets all his other
cats and he wants to be all tough and
mighty cuz he's like a tough cat and he
has to tell them that his name is Claire
my name is Claire bear are you
I don't think we can see you anyway I'm
gonna vlog as you know I'm using Missy's
camera hey can you be quiet in there I'm
trying to end the vlog as you can see
I'm using Missy's pink camera and to be
honest my camera kind of sucks it's got
like stuff on the screen I can't get off
it's falling apart it was super cheap
I'm pretty sure I bought like a reverb
when we first did it I don't know
Missy's is like super durable that's
probably really it that's probably
really annoying huh then I tap it like
that I definitely want to get a new one
and I'm you know what they have green
ones I think I should get agreement what
do you guys think should I stick with
the black or should I get a green one I
think the green would be cool I don't

will see you tomorrow taking a blood
pressure you feel okay
