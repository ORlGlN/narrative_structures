that way there you go yeah go down your

I honestly feel like this was like the
best investment we made for his
Christmas because he plays with it all
the time so I you can funk your head in
there look at this I'm not just
beautiful you guys good morning it is a
beautiful 68 degrees out here Missy I
guess is filling up the pool we do have
company coming over later but today I
have a job and that is to get new
cushions for our outdoor patio these are
the cushions that came with it and there
they've been out all season and they're
really gross so I'm just gonna run by
Louis I saw they were having a special
on him but I need to measure them first
look at me be it all handy yes I do know
how to use a tape measure so that is on
my lips today to get new cushions for
out here but dang it is a great day for
a barbecue wouldn't you say and I think
we are actually gonna have a barbecue
I finally got Ali's room clean it has
been driving me nuts it's been kind of a
disaster the past few weeks and mostly
because I just he kind of comes in here
he'll like throw out all those books on
the floor and then I'm too exhausted to
clean them up I'm glad I finally got it
clean I've actually been doing a lot of
cleaning in here always to pee in my
makeup chair what are you doing yeah
you're sitting in the chair alright I
care I think it's just about your nap
time Kay he's been actually being really
good while I do my makeup and clean it
up but I do something with my hair I do
not have the energy today to do my hair
and I don't know what I'm gonna do with
it and I really don't want to straighten
it so I think I might actually try and
wear it curly I'm not sure I guess we'll
see what I end up doing with it
alright come on it's nap time may I get
you ready for your nap I know
se9 night of karma come on baby
today my dad and his family are coming
over we're just gonna hang out a little
bit eat some dinner
and maybe swim a little bit and I know a
lot of people ask a lot of questions
about my birth father and if you guys
don't know actually almost a year ago
this month was when I decided that I was
going to look for my birth father
because I'd never met him
and I think a month after that we ended
up meeting after you know finding him
and being so open about it on the vlog I
really just kind of took a step back
from it not even for like my sake or
your sake it's honestly for their sake
just because I know that they are not
used to this whole vlogging thing they
probably don't really understand it a
whole lot we've hung out a couple times
since then it's really awesome I mean
he's a really great guy super laid back
and his family is like super loving and
accepting we basically just want to
respect their feelings so I found these
cool navy blue colors at Lowe's holy cow
took me forever to get through that
traffic you guys hopefully Missy likes
this color but if not I kept from
receipt that's first rule of shopping
for things for your wife always keep
your receipt
alright you guys want to see the
finished product I got new cushions
those blue ones which makes you like
Missy likes so plus and then I actually
found this outdoor rug also and I just
think it's nice because if we do go to
the pool and then to the table so like
dry our feet and just be a little bit
more comfortable it just makes it look a
little nicer starting to look really
good back here just been cleaning up and
I sprayed down all around the pool area
so it's nice look at there pretty good

in one door then he told Noah to put two
of every kind of animal on the ark God
sent the animals to Noah - right - there
were two elephants and two mice - two
cans and two lion carry giraffes and two
pandas then it started to rain it rain
and rain until all the earth was covered
in with water see the dolphin after 40
days the rain stopped and Noah sent out
a dove when the Dove returned with an
olive branch
no one knew there was dry land finally
Noah opened the door to let all the
animals off the ark and there in the sky
was a rainbow a sign of God's promise
that a flood would never again destroy
the whole earth
