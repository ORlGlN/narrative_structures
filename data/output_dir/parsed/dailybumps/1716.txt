completely mobile you're completely
mobile aren't you we should go to that
pool I'm gonna heal myself to this one
and
okay it's not that cold this is the one
this is a warm pool get in get in
oh it's painful to watch you do this I
am wearing my Fitbit flex and you can
wear it while swimming I've won it while
showering but yeah
here tap on it Missy see if the little
things show up oh wait does it look like
it I think you just put me into sleep
mode hit it again
you put me in a sleep mode there we go
oh yeah you can wear it while swimming
and a lot of people have been asking me
about it and I just want to say that I
do still love it it's been tracking my
activity really really well
got it alright you gotta jump in three
two
whoa go on three two oh there you go
that fun yeah I remember when you were
like one-year-old that's all you did do
you remember that you would just climb
out of the pool and jump back in over
and over and over and over and over
again
why do you backflip or cut left back
so that somebody was a lot of fun I felt
so nice yet in the pool and I was able
to get into the big pool so I'm proud of
myself for that now I me my mom were
headed to her doctor's appointment
she said get everything checked out
because she's like I said a few blogs
ago that she's been filming actually a
lot better and we're wondering if we
need to go through with the surgery
because you know when you have a when
you do surgery there is that small
chance that you do make things works and
it's just scary and so we're thinking
what if we don't have to do the surgery
or what if we can at least postpone it
until after the birth that way she can
be there and all that shoot Mada gasps
mama we're working on it all out of gas
and I'm gonna be like this is awesome
see that not awesome literally just
walked in my room and Brian left it when
he leaves for work he just leaves
everything a disaster is it crazy I
don't I don't know why he does this but
I guess that's just how he gets ready I
think he panics right before and he
starts thinking he's gonna be late and
he starts throwing things around I mean
how many outfits did he try on I mean
actually those are mostly bathing suits
how does he have to paying suits hmm um
excuse me Carmen I think I'm going to go
ahead and try and sew up this bumper
because we have actually regular size
bedding for the bed but we have a mini
crib and so I have to try and figure out
a way to incorporate regular-sized
bedding into this and so I'm gonna try
and do some sewing today I'm going to
try and catch some of this big movements
he's going crazy
okay that was a lot right there that was
actually pretty good
Oh another one he is just been going
crazy for the past hour
kicking me come on dude I'm gonna go
ahead yes by the way my shirt is up it's
just very sore right now so what I'm
doing is I'm going to try and make this
bumper which is for a regular sized crib
fit into this mini crib the reason is is
because let's say there are not a lot of
mini crib bedding sets out there there
just isn't and if there is they're not
in my theme if I could find a mini crib
bedding set I'd have to have it like
almost custom-made I'm like Etsy or
something so we actually got this
bedding set from Kelly for free and she
just was so nice enough to just kind of
give it to us then we're gonna go ahead
and try and figure out if we can make
this bumper fit the mini crib oh man
it's way into the storage room to get my
sewing machine out and look where it is
right in there this is so sad I was so
excited I was gonna be all productive so
I just got out of work I had to film a
graduation and it was actually really
cool because they had a really really
awesome commencement speech by one of
the guys who runs one of the huge
wineries in this area the whole thing
like just started making me think of my
graduation and like how like fast it
went
and I remember little things about my
graduation it was cool just to sort of
like relive all those you know watching
all these kids graduate - okay so after
some convincing of my brother I was able
to get in to bring out my sewing machine
remember how I was out of gas
and my way here are on my way to work
well I forgot to get gas and now I'm
really really out of gas and so here's
to hoping that I don't well I guess
should I go up on that x-axis I never
know what to do here we go
and you're really nervous he's just like
cut into it hopefully hopefully I can do
this play whatever I'm thinking my brain
actually is gonna work oh good gosh dude
yeah I also got a little boost because
I'm exhausted
I slept maybe like five hours which
crazy I've been exhausted all day and
watch with my life is gonna go okay
we're good oh my gosh I did you guys
like I'm totally freaking out like okay
well of course it's not perfect you can
see that there's like stitching but uh
that's pretty cool and it totally is
gonna fit it's I don't know it's kind of
cute though it just kind of helps with
decoration like ties it all in what do
you think Bryan Bryan's home by the way
I decided to skip the little ties
because really didn't feel like pushing
my luck and messing it all up and it's
not that big a deal it's not gonna be in
here when he's sleeping anyways I don't
know it's kind of cute though it looks
so good with the blanket yeah did you
take the tack room feasel yeah noise
yeah I just think it like helps tie it
in a little bit yeah it's really good
it's dinner and we're kind of bored and
like maybe it is an idea to go hang out
at the hot tub no one's with us usually
we have like a whole party friend yeah
but today it's just me and Brian we are
actually at Tara Lynn's hot tub which is
Missy's cousin we went down to the
community pool which technically were
not allowed in and there was a guard and
we were like okay we're gonna go hang
out of her hot tub so we did and we just
got out and funny story I was getting
out to get the camera and vlog and I
ripped my pants so that's what's going
