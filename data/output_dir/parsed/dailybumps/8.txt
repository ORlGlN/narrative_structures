- We're over here taking
refuge at the adult table.
- This is the safe zone.
-  Yeah, and this is the chaos.
- Somebody took their shoe off.
(kids giggling)
- It's a stinky shoe now!

-  Good morning!
- Hi boys, how are you?
-  Good.
- Did you sleep good?
-  Yeah.
- Yeah?
So this morning, Missy
left very, very early.
4:00 A.M. she left, and it's
just me and the boys now.
We are at home, and we're just
gonna make this work, right?
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah.
Ooh, are you playing with a wand?
- Ow.
-  (laughs)
As you can tell, Finn had oatmeal
because it's all over him.
Why's it all over you?
It's supposed to be in your
belly, not on your shirt.
(chuckles)
Good morning, Ollie.
- Good morning.
-  You miss Mama?
- Yeah.
-  Are you excited to
hang out with Dada though?
- Mm-hmm.
- So for this vlog, I
thought I would give you guys
an idea of what it's
like 24 hours, two kids,
no Mama, no wife.
Let's see what happens. (chuckles)
(relaxed music)
This is so funny, you guys, look at this.
I woke up this morning,
came into the bathroom,
and she left me this little note.
Isn't that sweet of her?
Oh Finny, what do you think you have?
Finn, what do you have?
- A doo-dee.
-  You got a cookie?
- Yeah!
-  (laughs) You
think just 'cause you ate
all your breakfast, you
get a cookie already?
- Yeah.
-  Hey, you can't take a cookie
without asking permission, dude.
- No.
- You have to say, "Daddy,
can I have a cookie please?"
- Yeah.
-  Say it.
- I cookie please!
- (laughs)
That wasn't even close.
How did he get that cookie?!
Give me that cookie back, Finn.
Oh, you think just 'cause you can hide
under the table that you're safe there?
Well, Luna's gonna come eat that cookie.
Luna, eat that cookie!
Get it out of his hands!
Get it, Luna!
-  Can I have a cookie please?
-  You can have a cookie if you
finish your breakfast, okay?
You can have it. (laughs)
These kids are going to destroy me.
Send help.
All right, you all done
with your breakfast?
- Yeah, I can balance it with one hand.
-  Well, that's pretty good.
One thing we've been
teaching Ollie is that,
when he is done with his food, he needs to
put it in the sink and
clean up after himself, huh?
-  Yeah.
-  Pop it in, there you go.
Thanks, dude.
- I'm gonna get a cookie.
-  Okay, you can have
a good old morning cookie.
Looks like Missy was having
a little midnight snack
before she got on the
plane yesterday, huh?
- Yeah.
- We are all dressed for the day,
and we are all wearing Star Wars shirts.
-  Yeah.
- Look it, I'm repping Chewie.
- I wear BB-8 and, wait, where's?
-  Yeah, BB-8 and R2.
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, and Finn.
- All the spaceships.
-  Yeah, that's so cool.
Finn, show me what you got.
- I got (mumbles).
-  He's got
stormtroopers and Darth Vader.
-  Darth Vader, yeah.
- And it says, "Hanging
with my troops." (laughs)
All right, come here,
it's time to do hair.
Put stuff in hair.
We gotta look semi-decent, I guess.
You too, you need some of
this, too, 'kay? (chuckles)
Oh, you don't like that brush, huh?
- Yeah.
- It's gotta be this brush. (laughs)
All right, let's blow dry this hair.
Looks good, dude. (chuckles)
And the kids are all ready.
You got your hair all done.
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, are you gonna
have a good day with Dada?
- Yeah!
- Well, I showed you earlier
the note above the toilet.
There are a lot more. (chuckles)
And Missy said, "Bet you
can't find all my notes, lol."
Here's another one on the Apple HomePod.
"Greatest Showman is perfect for bedtime,"
'cause the boys love listening to that
when they take their bath.
Also, this one was sweet.
On the scale she put, "Proud of you."
I love you, babe, and I hope you're having
an amazing time in Hawaii without me.
For the second time.
(bright music)
- You just drive right past my school.
- I know I did, huh? (chuckles)
I am taking the boys out to have some fun,
and let out some energy, and
we drove past Ollie's school.
And every time we drive
past it, he gets so excited,
because he's like, "That's
my school, that's my school!"
And I think he always wants
me to drop him off there.
- Oh yeah, this is where the new park is.
-  What's up, Amelia?
- Good.
-  Finn, do you
wanna go play in that park?
Go play, go have fun!
Aww, are you nervous 'cause
there's lots of people here?
Finn got a good little nap on the car ride
over here, didn't you, huh? (chuckles)
Go, Finn!
He's flying, like Buzz Lightyear, dude!
(laughs)
Whoa!
You kind of stalled
there, dude. (chuckles)
Finny, you can't go up the slide,
you're supposed to go
down the slide, silly!
- No!
- Yeah! Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!
Can you go down while it's tickling?
While you're being tickled? Oh!
This is seriously the coolest
park ever, look at this.
They, like, modeled it
after Old Town Temecula.
So they have, like, the
General Merchandise Store,
the Post Office, so much to
climb, and see, and explore.
And we got Jude in the house.
What's up, man?
- What's up!
-  Ollie and Jude on the swings.
-  Really high!
-  Really high?
-  He wants to
go really high, Brooke.
-  Okay, I'm working on it.
-  (laughs)
-  Yeah, what's up?
-  Buzz Lightyear!
-  Yeah, this kid's
a Buzz Lightyear fan.
They gotta go high.
-  Yeah!
-  Watch yourself,
there, dude. (laughs)
This is such a cool little rock wall, too.
Ollie loves doing these.
You got it, dude, now put
your foot right there.
There you go, oh!
You okay?
Look it, Jude's got it.
Can you go all the way to the top?
Yes you can.
Easy for him, he's tall. (laughs)
Wow, crawl through, guys!
This is so cool.
There's like a huge log
here to crawl through.
Wow. You can climb on top of it.
-  Yeah.
-  You're getting
to be a good climber, dude.
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!
(laughs)
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!
I think this was a good idea.
First night with the boys on my own.
I think that they are
going to be exhausted,
and hopefully they go to bed very easily.
And stay in bed.
What?
- Again.
-  Tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle!
We love having fun together, huh?
Finny, look it, we found some horses.
That's so cool, is that
how you ride a horse, Jude?
(laughs)
You just jump right on top of it?
- Yep.
-  These are huge.
I don't think these
are just, oh, you okay?
Well, when you fall off a horse,
you know what you gotta do, Finn?
You gotta get back on, 'kay?
(grunts)
Sit on the horse like Mommy.
Sit on it like Mommy, Finn. (chuckles)
Look it, they even got a little colt here.
That's cute.
(chuckling) Isn't that cool?
- I think I could jump off.
-  You think so?
It's kinda high.
They have this huge climbing structure,
and Ollie can climb
all the way to the top.
Right, Ollie?
-  Yeah.
-  That is amazing, look at him go.
Get it, dude.
Careful when you get to the top.
Pay attention.
Oh my gosh, he's so high
up there. (chuckles)
There is a covered wagon
here, and Ollie just climbed
to the top all on his own.
Let me see your muscles.
Yeah! (laughs)
This is so cool.
There's like a cool little fire pit.
- And I'm in the fire!
Going on the zip line with Jude.
- Yeah, we're both going on the zip line!
- They have this super cool zip line here
that goes around the whole park,
and we finally have
convinced Ollie to do it.
And I think he's going to love it,
if he doesn't get scared
before he gets up there,
but there are kids
smaller than him doing it.
He should be able to do it.
All right, Ollie's gonna do it with Daddy.
Woo!
(bright music)
Was that cool?
- Yeah.
- Yeah? (chuckles)
You did it, dude, I'm proud of you.
(bright music)
So we are now at Pat & Oscars for dinner
with Brooke and Sean, and we're over here
taking refuge at the adult table.
- This is the safe zone.
-  Yeah.
And this is the chaos.
Hi. (chuckles)
You kiddos doing okay?
- Somebody took their shoe off.
(kids giggling)
- It's a stinky shoe now!
-  (laughs)
Ollie, what's on your straw?
- Uh, a bread.
-  A breadstick?
And how many breadsticks have you eaten?
Be honest.
- One, two, three.
(adults laugh)
-  That's not bad.
They've been so good all together,
it's been the cutest thing, honestly.
But yeah, it's a little mayhem.
So we just got back from
something really cool.
It was Ollie's first open
house at preschool, huh?
- Yeah.
- He got to see the classroom that
he may be going into next year, right?
And you got to show me all the
cool stuff in your classroom.
And look at this, you guys,
he made a little caterpillar!
Isn't that so cool?
- It's actually an ant, guys.
- It's an ant?
- Yeah, there's a lot of ants.
- Well, I thought it was a caterpillar,
'cause you guys are growing butterflies
in your classroom right now.
- I know, we was making this last time.
-  Oh, that's cool.
So it's made out of an egg
crate and you painted it?
- Yeah.
-  That's so cool.
- Then we put the eyes on.
-  Yeah?
- And these little
tentacles so it can walk.
-  Oh, that's cool.
And look at this, you guys.
They had this hung up on the wall.
It was what his favorite
Dr. Seuss book is,
is Have You Seen My Dinosaur.
Look at that picture, he's so cute.
Did you guys have a fun day out with Dada?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- You did, too?
You, Finn, was so good, you know that?
I am so proud of you, Finn.
- Yeah.
- I love you.
Well now we are gonna get ready for bed.
It's gonna get time to quiet down.
So you guys have just a couple
more minutes to play, okay?
-  Okay.
-  You all ready for bed, Finny?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
I'm getting the boys ready for bed.
And while I was doing
so, I found another note!
About instructions on how
to give the kids vitamins.
(chuckles)
Oh look, another note.
Don't forget to floss
Finn's two front teeth.
I have instructions, Finn.
- Oh.
-  Ahh.
- Ahh.
-  There we go, Finny.
(laughs)
This is difficult.
You try?
Oh, it's gotta be wet?
Is that better?
- More.
-  Gotta brush those teeth,
and get rid of all the sugar bugs!
Yes, we do!
All right, say ahh.
Oh, you got this?
You can do it all on your own?
Look how big my kid is,
he's brushing his own teeth.
No, you're getting too big.
(chuckles)
All right, we did vitamins, we did shower,
we brushed teeth, we had
a really awesome day,
and now it's time for bedtime.
Right, kiddos?
Yeah, are you tired?
- Yeah.
-  Oh, hi.
- Hi!
-  Hi.
-  Say hi.
- Hi, Mama.
-  Hi, Mama.
-  Did you guys
just get out of the bath?
-  Yeah.
-  We had to take a shower.
-  Oh, cool.
- Goodnight, Mommy.
-  Say night night, Finn.
-  Give Mommy a kiss.
(Finn moans)
(Missy chuckling)
- Did you boys have such a good day?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we got to talk to Mommy in Hawaii.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, she's having fun, right?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.
Thank you boys for being
such good boys for Daddy.
Yeah, we're gonna have some
fun with these kiddos, right?
(laughs)
But anyway, I hope you
guys enjoyed today's video.
If you did, be sure to
give it a big thumb's up,
subscribe, and we will see
you mañana, right, Finny?
- Yeah.
-  Bye! Boop.
(upbeat music)
