stroller and I thought this is our son
baby boy is gonna do amazing things
oh hey guys how's it goin
nothing you're gonna try and say good
morning to you guys good is definitely
not morning I just took an amazing nap I
got up really early this morning with
Oliver like really early too early
actually because he we didn't really
time it right in his nap ended up being
right when he was supposed to go to swim
today I got up with him and made him
breakfast and I got some work done watch
some cartoons with him at the same time
and then I don't know what came over me
I just got really tired I was like I
need to take a nap if you guys don't
know we actually switch off getting up
with Oliver every morning today was my
morning so I had to get up really early
with him but on days my morning I'm
still up the night before editing and
uploading though I tend to like take
little catnaps but I just took like an
hour and a half not and it felt so good
I'm gonna be honest I was a little upset
I woke up and it's not iPhone launch day
there's a piece of me and I was like
maybe I'll fall asleep and I'll wake up
and then I can cook at my new iPhone I
feel very energized I bet that this
super bright window has something to do
with it
Ollie can you say good afternoon like
mom no good afternoon guys I miss swim
and I just spilt food all down his shirt
so that's a bummer oh oh oh
woke up early and then by the time it
was time for his swim he just was super
tired and I'm really really bummed about
it cuz they don't have anything that I
can go to later either to like do a
class or you literally slept for like
two hours woke up
now eat lunch I'm trying to convince him
that cottage cheese and apple sauce mix
together is good what do you say yeah
you want to try you know try it's like
no mom I can't do that yeah I don't know
if you like this
he makes weird faces and then but he
does ask for more so if he does all
right we're running errands with Mimi
yay me my mom actually really wanted to
go to the makeup store and so I decided
to go together but while I'm out I
decided I'm gonna go to Radio Shack I
didn't even know Radio Shack was still a
thing I didn't even think people go to
Radio Shack anymore but I thought I
would take my monitor in and see if
maybe they have a charger that I could
use or a battery that I can put in there
that would work and I would be amazing I
would like love Radio Shack forever
you guys I still don't know what to do
do we get the iPhone 6 or the 6 plus I
mean I have an iPhone 6 all we have to
do is go pick it up tomorrow but I think
I'm gonna go with white this year I got
a black one but they said you can change
your color in the store so I definitely
think I'm gonna go with a white iPhone 6
and I really really want the six plus
you guys I've watched videos about it
all around the internet I know it's
really big I just don't I don't know if
I I don't I just don't know if it's
really worth it having that big of a
phone you know how big is your phone
what do you guys have right now I know
like the note 3 is kind of like the same
size as the 6 plus cherokee telling me
that the 4.7 inch screen on the iPhone 6
is perfect but I don't know oh by the
time you guys are watching this I'll be
will have our new iPhones that's gonna
be really exciting tomorrow is iPhone
day we'll be trying out the 6 plus in
the store I'm gonna hold it I'm gonna
try and put in my pocket if they let me
I'm gonna do some very rigorous tests to
see if I would actually like it they did
it actually found me a charger to charge
this thing and it wasn't even it was
like 20 bucks why didn't I do that in
the first place I'm so mad because I can
totally now spy on him again
ah so it's like a huge relief but part
of me is like really mad that I didn't
just like go here in the first place but
I got it I fixed it and yeah I'm so
excited real fun begins we're going to
old tub Beauty which is actually a new
makeup store that opened up and they got
lots of really cool coupons and deals so
it's a little bit better than Sephora
and they have like Sephora type makeup
but then they also have a drugstore type
makeup all right he's getting a little
bit antsy Oh like with shoes on so you
can walk around I don't have a good
feeling about this stuff okay that's
what this thing yeah that got a make
though lipstick ooh actually you know
guys I've been read I want this palette
so badly it's a little pricey though hum
baby not right now what else do I like
done Oh Oh see you later

primers

touching he was just getting really
antsy in his stroller and I thought that

not going back in a stroller though you
got crazy if you think he's going back
in the stroller huh yeah alright after
some girly time now we have to have lows
time but Bryan really wanted me to pick
up some fly traps for the backyard so I
guess I'll do that but I was going to
tell you guys the tell-tale Tellez I
hated tail tail tail the telltale sign
that you've been at the beauty store
marking once all over like our wrists in
our next
I'm like this is all yeah so but that's
okay cuz we got something cool yeah
what's that ollie

green but she's nice
well how do you move that gonna give me
nightmares
we like let's go Mimi let's go better
later crazy
thank you he's like slowly like let's
get out of here this is a daily issue in
our house right now
Ali's climbing in the pantry and what is
it did you want you want Apple Jacks you
are upset look at him he's obsessed with
Applejack ah okay he knows where they
already just gets them all the time
thanks quite hilarious no more look at
this kid
this kids love to snap don't you take
bites of that if I give it to you you
just take bites good job that was a good
bite kid oh my god he's taking after me
you guys he loves to snack I don't I
don't think that's a good thing you're
so cute though check it out I can see
him and he's trying to take his nap
right now is so nice to be able to see
what he's doing in there it was like
really driving me nuts but as you can
see it actually is only like able to
really latch on a little bit can't go in
all the way so it's not like the perfect
match so I'm definitely still waiting
for the one that the company is sending
to me but they said it could be like
another week or so like I think that
they don't even get it into their
warehouse until the 19th and yeah I can
see he's just sitting there right now it
goes and takes his naps
on his own now he doesn't need me to
nurse miss sleep might take him a few
minutes to actually fall asleep but he
does it and he doesn't he really doesn't
cry he does every once in a while but
for the most part he's putting himself
to bed and he's not even crying self to
bed so it's pretty pretty cool can you
say let's go out back tonight huh

love that you have a personnel because I
don't have to carry my wallet yeah
