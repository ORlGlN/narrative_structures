anyways we are currently watching the
news if you guys don't know there was a
shooting at LAX this morning it looks
like at this point all I know of is
three people have been wounded so it's
really sad and of course it's on TV like
crazy it's breaking news and all that
but the interesting thing is is that
about two weeks ago me and Brian were
planning our trip our our vacation we
were actually going to go to San
Francisco to visit our friends then the
end we decided not to but today would
have been the day that we would have
left to go to San Francisco we would
have gone to LAX because that was the
the cheapest flights to San Francisco
from LAX to San Fran it would have been
going today not crazy that's really
insane I can't believe like this was a
date we're planning on being there yeah
we were gonna leave this morning and
then we'd come back on Monday or so do
you understand how close you are to like
making that trip yeah and I'm pretty
sure around the time that happened the I
think the flight I was like around 9:30
so I don't know what time the shooting
happened and what time we would have
been there but we were so close like we
were like really close to clicking and
then the end we just kind of like
decided to achieve that day removed our
vacation to a winter vacation instead
yeah exactly he would have been there I
don't know if it would have been around
that same time but like something we
just decided not to and then it's just
crazy how close to home that is I mean
that's an LAX yeah it's like an hour
away yeah we were gonna even that was a
new I've never flown out of LAX I don't
think I have um but we were going to do
that one because I was the cheapest one
very interesting how life works out good

baby you want to know what it says
basically says I'm getting an iPad air
it says something new is coming into
your life to benefit a view bulb right
guys it's so true right now actually
says someone but someone I believe is
that iPad out okay I see I have the very
human-like quality to it but if it was
someone who would it be that would
benefit us who's coming into our life
we'd have another baby huh you discover
treasures where others see nothing
unusual lame the only cool fortunes are
the ones that say you're gonna get
something or am i right yeah look how
thin it is you guys
it's so light fill it fill it which one
do you want luckily I don't care I don't
I don't like the chrome in the back you
like look how thin the side bezel is two
different if you don't know we you can
tell them were using something different
yeah we're using my phone because I
forgot my vlogging camera don't fed and
this is hammer died so it's really like
a blog with this camera is it why it's
just so close oh it's like backup yeah

one time that we go out without two
cameras usually we always I always have
mine he always this is my camera dies
and we had no camera so find mine where
are your clothes
good job so we just got our daily bumps
iPad this what we're calling it yeah
because this color is like our color you
guys it just like follows us analyze
there it is
yeah actually really like the color of
our car in the color boy's room and I
got a new iPad we got a new iPad babe
it was my iPad we sold it and then we
got an iPad okay let's start over
we had iPads and he sold his iPad to get
something different then I can't ride
then we sold my iPad so that we could
get an iPad that's out way there's
nothing by the way I just want to say
you just the most magical moment of an
Apple unboxing yeah I was gonna refer
them to something else remember that
video you made on your channel of you
unboxing it was pretty hilarious I don't
even think it's up anymore if it is all
linked up below don't watch it this is
the new iPad it seems lighter let me see
it's way lighter it weighs like a little
I could spin it on one finger no don't
don't spend my iPad look at how thin it
is it's so pretty it's so light and fun
to hold did you notice the side bezels
are smaller babe I have no idea what
that means bathtime this is probably the
cutest thing in the world I just been
letting them sit in here for a while so
we could play click the most exercise
you've ever gotten huh
as you can see we've transferred into
the tub in the tub because he splashes
so much you did so cute I want you to be
able to play so I put you in here hard
to do it with this thing on you huh I
can't show people your junk okay so what
do you think about our new iPad my iPad
is really pretty
is it's so cool-looking like the way it
like it hugs the iPad a little
differently like inside it's just really
cool-looking I do like the iBooks app
this hunger games she needs to read
Hunger Games yeah hopefully I can do
that soon it's much lighter I do like
how light it is
yeah so you can easily hold that watch
Grey's Anatomy on Netflix and nurse him
exactly well that's it for today's vlog
I hope you guys enjoyed it we are gonna
plan a live chat soon I know we haven't
done in a long time since Ali's been
born I think we're gonna do something

Q&A portion and then maybe like a little
game portion like a scavenger hunt like
