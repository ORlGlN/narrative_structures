- Good morning guys,
apparently I didn't get
the memo this morning,
there was family outfits for
church coordinated prior,
I wasn't able to be involved.
- Okay.
-  Look at my cute family.
- I looked to see if
there was one your size
and it's just mom.
- Aww.
- I think this technically,
I think it's for mom
and daughter, so I was like
these are kind of boyish.
-  Yeah.
All right, we're at the blue pig,
we're gonna go get
breakfast before church.
You guys are so cute in
your matching sweaters.
You excited to eat some food?
- Yeah.
- Finn what are you going to order?
(babbles)
He's like uhh, this giant pig,
okay let's go buddy, let's go.
You're so cute.
All right we are taking
a seat at our table.
Look Finn, we get to sit on
a couch, isn't that cool?
(laughing)
- Guys, look.
-  Is someone
out there doing stuff?
We have this amazing view
of a beautiful golf course,
it's like such a beautiful day.
-  I know how to do that.
-  Oh you do?
What Finn? (laughing)
Finn's just always copying
everything Ollie does.
We've got people golfing over here,
and the boys are loving it.
They are like, why are
they hitting that ball?
Should we go golfing someday Ollie?
- Yeah.
- Me and you?
(upbeat music)
Babe our kids are so funny.
- I know, they like do
everything that they pick up.
- Yeah, Finn has to copy
everything Ollie does,
it's so hilarious.
- I literally tell Ollie,
don't do that and then he'll
do something else don't do that
and then Ollie, the same
thing, he'll do the two things.
-  Finn the same thing, yeah.
Are you drinking chocolate
milk and water together?
(laughing)
Finn's like, this is kind of weird.
(upbeat music)
So we just got done eating breakfast,
and I think it's so cool,
because outside of the restaurant
they have these huge troughs,
and they're growing herbs
that they use in the actual kitchen,
which I think is so cool!
Look at all these greens
and herbs they use.
Look you guys,
over here they're growing
oregano and rosemary.
That is cool.
(babbling)
You want to see?
- Yeah.
- Yeah look.
They're growing stuff for
the kitchen, it's cool!
All right we're all done with church
and we're hanging out with our friends,
Jude and Joelle, and they have a kitty!
- And we also have a PlayStation VR,
if you've never heard of
this, make sure to buy one,
because they're sick.
-  So we are
checking out their cats,
this one is peacing
out, it's like okay bye.
- Maymay, she's a rescue,
her mommy abandoned her,
so we've had her since
she was nine days old.
- Is this the one that I met
when it was super little.
- Yes.
- Oh, okay, aww.
- So she survived, but
she's a little funny.
-  She's still young.
- She's really young., I
think around six months old.
-  Whoa, who is this one?
- Tudder.
- Tudder? (laughing)
Hi, what do you think
Ollie, are they sweet?
-  This is a girl
and that's the boy.
-  Hi.
Hi kitty.
Finn's like, I'm gonna come
in for the hug. (laughing)
- He's the sweet one.
- You look like a cat I had when
I was younger named Bubba.
- Aww.
- Remember Bubba?
-  No, or Claire, aww, Clarence.
- If you want to know something,
this cat actually lost fur
and we thought he couldn't
make it, but he made it,
because he got super sick,
and then he got scabs all over his face.
-  Now he's good and cured?
-  He was a mess.
-  What did we just find?
- Oh, the cutest cat in the world.
-  This is
Cupcake, and what is she?
- She's a ragdoll.
It just means she's floppy and
likes to be held like a baby,
and she'll just kind of hang out.
She's getting to be kind
of a teenager though,
so she's getting kind of sassy.
-  She's so cute.
- One second, we're going
to let Ollie hold her.
Yeah, she's a sweetie face.
- She's my own kitty.
-  She is so soft.
Did you name her Cupcake?
- Yeah.
- What's her middle name?
- Moon.
- Cupcake Moon.
-  Cupcake Moon.
- She wants her tummy rubbed.
- She looks like frosting.
- And look at her face.
-  She's so cute.
- Couple of lines.
-  Did Santa bring her to you?
- Did Santa bring her?
Kind of, Santa was involved.
- Can I tell why I named her cupcake
because she looks like frosting,
and these look like chocolate chips,
and her eyes are blueberries.
- She does look like frosting, yeah,
I can see those reasons,
those are good reasons.
- Let's give Missy a time okay.
- This is like holding the new baby,
everyone's like I want
to hold the new baby.
- Oh my gosh.
-  What do you think Ollie?
-  Do you like her?
-  Ollie has always
just loved cats, it's so funny.
-  She's a good one too,
this is a really good breed for kids,
because they're really, really mellow.
She gets crazy too, but
she's really friendly.
And they get huge, like, main coons.
-  Ollie's so in love.
(laughing)
How is this real?
- You are so cute.
-  You are so cute.
Look at those eyeballs.
-  She is so
cute, how old is she now?
- She is just about five months,
so she is starting to
be a bit of a teenager.
(talking and laughing)
-  I think she looks
really good on you Missy.
- I know.
This is like, a chill cat,
we had like a crazy cat.
-  I know, I miss
our main coon, Clarence.
- Ya, we had a Clare, I
thought it was a girl,
but he ended up being a boy.
-  So we just changed
the name to Clarence.
- Can still be Clare.
-  Yeah, Clare and Clarence.
Ollie is playing with the laser.
You've got to point the
laser at the ground okay?
And then they'll get it.
Say, come get it Cupcake.
-  Come get it Cupcake.
-  Hey cupcake!
She's so cute.
(soft music)
All right so we just
left our friends house,
the boys had so much fun playing.
Then we saw strawberries,
like a strawberry stand
on the side of the road.
Right now in California,
there are no strawberries
in the grocery stores,
they just disappeared.
- They are all like white and gross.
- Yeah, so they're not even
putting them out in the produce sections.
But, we just got a half
a flat of strawberries.
Look at this.
-  Our whole car smells
like fresh strawberries.
- This is my hand, and
look at that, that's huge.
Crazy, they look so good.
One of the perks about
living in California,
is you can get strawberries like this
on the side of the road.
Alrighty, we've been slowly
putting things back together.
- I know, it looks good.
- Yeah so we've put up some
of our entertainment stuff.
If you guys didn't see our vlog yesterday,
we saw our new entertainment
system we had built.
- And like I said, it's not done,
a lot of the finishing stuff
will be done hopefully tomorrow.
So, but this is kind of
fun, to get to decorating.
-  Totally, so we
have our pictures up here,
more pictures over here,
we might do like little baskets down here.
- I think baskets will
kind of break up the white
and just like basic decor.
I think like cool wood, or
wicker basket or something.
- It's starting to look good though,
we still have a lot of stuff
to bring in from the garage,
there's like furniture that
needs to be brought in too.
Our house is just like empty
now that Christmas is over.
- Yeah I know, I mean its
hard when it's all bare,
and it feels like you just moved in,
you like really want to get stuff back up.
-  I know. (laughing)
Whoa, is that a picture of Ollie?
-  Yeah.
-  That's his
first day of school, huh?
- And mine, when I was born
I used to be like that.
-  Yeah is that you?
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
- All right, these boys are
going to brush their teeth.
It's toothirty, right?
Real good time to brush your teeth.
- Time for bed.
- We had such a fun day, you guys,
and we were so productive.
We got up early and we went
to breakfast before church.
That's pretty good for us,
so I think that counts as a good day.
But yeah, I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video.
If you did be sure to
give it a big thumbs up.
We'll see you manana,
we've got some fun stuff happening,
Missy and I are traveling
somewhere super fun,
so it's gonna be a cool
week, so don't miss out.
Okay, bye, boop.
(upbeat music)
