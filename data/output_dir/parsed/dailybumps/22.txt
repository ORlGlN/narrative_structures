- Good morning, guys!
And welcome to today's vlog.
It is actually a B-E-A-utiful day here
in sunny southern California.
We have blue skies and clouds.
And last night, it poured rain.
And it was supposed to rain
and be cold all day today.
And it's still cold.
But look at these beautiful
blue skies, clouds.
It's amazing out here.
It's cold, let's go back inside.
Shut the door.
Before we get on to today's
vlog, I just wanted to say
a huge thank you to
each and everyone of you
for all your love and support.
We put up a vlog recently
of me going to the doctor
for the first time, who gave me a referral
to go see a neurologist
because she definitely thinks
that it's not something simple.
I joked in that vlog.
I'm definitely on this journey
of "what's wrong with Bryan?"
And hopefully, we figure it out soon.
And yeah, just seriously, thank you guys
for all the love and support.
I have been getting like,
so many amazing tweets.
You guys have been filling
out the comments section
with so much love and positivity.
And it's exactly what
the world needs today.
So, thank you guys so
much for all that you do.
We appreciate each and every one of you.
So, today, Missy is,
of course, at the barn.
She's got a riding lesson.
She's doing some English lessons.
And I'm hanging out in
the house with the boys.
But I just found something
pretty incredible.
I'm not sure what it is.
I don't want to get my hopes up,
but I'm gonna show the boys
and see what they think.
So you know that, right?
That's our starfish, Patrick.
Do you know what this is?
- No.
-  It's a baby starfish!
- Really?
-  There's a baby
starfish in our tank!
- Whoa.
-  I know, isn't that crazy?
We got a picture of it.
- I'm gonna go see it.
-  Okay, so I came over
here and there was definitely
something on the glass of the fish tank.
And I have to say our starfish
has been acting really weird.
It's been all over this thing.
And there was definitely
something on the glass.
I'll show you the picture I took.
I doubt you can even see
but there is a baby starfish
in the sand right now.
That is crazy.
So this is what it
looked like on the glass,
and it must have fallen off or something.
I'm not sure if it's going to last
but that is definitely a
baby starfish in our tank.
I'm not really sure how that happened.
Oh, hi, Luna.
What Ollie?
- I thought it was a flower.
-  No, it's a cute baby starfish.
Isn't it cute?
- Yeah.
- Look, it's got like,
legs and everything.
Okay, I'm going to sit
down and do some Googling
and see what we can find
when we Google baby starfish.
Let's check Google images
just to see if I'm seeing
what is actually a baby starfish.
Oh my gosh, look, okay, right there.
ReefSanctuary.com.
New rock equals baby starfish.
And look at all of these, yep.
Baby starfish, this is so tiny.
Oh my gosh.
I have a baby starfish about the size
of a pinkie fingernail,
came off of a piece of live coral.
Um, that actually is a huge possibility
'cause we just had our fish tank worked on
and we got a ton of new coral and stuff,
so it could've been something
that was actually hiding inside.
Or, it could've been that our starfish
actually gave birth.
I think that'd be amazing.
But that actually looks like it.
That is really, really
exciting and I feel bad
that it already fell off the glass.
But I'm really glad I took a
picture so I can show Missy.
I love that we have the salt water tank
and we get surprises like
this every now and then.
It's like, really, really fun.
Yeah, baby starfish!
You guys see that?
Look at this picture
of this baby starfish.
That is adorable.
Let us know what we should name it
down below in the comments.
Maybe Squishy.
Maybe he'll be my Squishy.
(laughing)
- Hi, I just got back from the barn.
I had a very eventful time
and Ollie is telling me what?
- There's a baby starfish.
-  We have a baby starfish?
- Yeah!
- How crazy!
I wanna go check it out.
I'm actually exhausted.
I don't know if I can honestly
get off this couch right now.
I did lessons and then
we had a horse get out.
Kick one of Maria's horses.
He was hurt pretty bad and it was so sad.
-  The starfish was right here!
-  He was right here?
-  Yeah.
- Hm, gotta keep your eyes open.
See if you can see him.
Tell me if you see him.
But anyways, how cool
that we have a starfish,
a baby starfish?
I hope that it gets nice and big.
Um, but, yeah.
I'm hurt, there was a lot of craziness.
It was just, it was sad.
He was just gushing blood
and we had to stop it.
And my dad actually came out to help out,
which was really nice.
And so yeah, it's just been
kind of a crazy morning,
and I just wanna sit down.
We were gonna like, go do stuff
and go places but think I
might just need to relax
for a little bit for I go out.
Luna, you're being crazy.
You're being crazy, Luna.
You wanna go outside.
Alright, I'll get up again.
So, I've had a little time to rest
after a kind of long, stressful day
and I wanna show you guys
some really cool changes
that we're making in the backyard.
So first of all, as you can see here,
this is my little egg apron
that Bryan got me for Christmas.
And I've used it a few
times but, to be honest,
I always, I never know where it is.
So I was like, can we hang it
back here so that I can like,
easily grab it if I need it but then like,
easily put it back, so like,
it's not like way down there
or way in there.
So we're just testing out this.
Obviously, we need to hook it onto here.
But this is perfect and
I was hanging it on here,
but Luna kept grabbing it and
dragging it out to the yard.
And doing what she does best.
Finny, you playing?
- Yeah.
-  Oh my goodness!
Are you playing with Spider Man?
-  Yeah.
- How cool.
And then we're actually
doing a few other things.
This summer, we're actually
making a lot of changes
with the yard and something really big
and exciting we're doing is
stuff to my chicken coop.
So you guys know we had this put in here
and we literally just like, set it here.
And now, we're just kinda trying to like,
raise up the dirt so it's all level.
And we wanna bring it
all the way down there
so that the kids have a place to play.
And we can like, garden over here.
And I just kinda wanna
clean up all of this.
And we've thrown out
lots of different ideas
with doing a pond back
here and things like that
but we just wanna keep it kinda simple.
Just like, a nice area
that I can get down here
for the chickens and the
kids can play over here
without putting a lot of,
a lot of this stuff ends
up getting in the grass
and then ruining the grass.
So we want a nice spot.
So we're kind of raising this up.
Got a pretty big drop right now
but we'll either add
like, stairs or a gradual.
Up, see, this is the problem
right here, Karma Chameleon.
Stop digging!
No, no digging.
The digging is ridiculous.
I thought it was Luna but I
actually think it is Karma.
Ah, you're stepping in the mud!
Look at all these holes, you guys.
Hole, hole, really big
hole, even bigger hole.
Oh, look at this hole.
No, no!
That hole and that hole and that hole
and that hole and that hole.
They are literally ruining our yard.
I thought it was Luna 'cause
we never had a digger before
until we got Luna but
every time I turn around,
I see him digging.
So if you guys have any suggestions on how
to make your dog stop digging,
please let us know in the comments.
We've been sticking like, rocks in there.
Or even like, dog poop so
that if they start digging,
they're like, ew, that stinks.
I don't want to touch it.
Any other suggestions, please let us know.
'Cause we're doing a lot of landscaping
and we don't want the
dogs tearing it all up.
I'm so excited to see how
this is gonna turn out.
It's going to be so cute!
And then check out this little spud.
We went ahead and put these bricks here
and we got like, a tall plant.
Isn't that so pretty?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. We got little plants here.
And it's just so fun.
You guys need to be careful.
Don't ruin our plants, okay?
As you guys know, me and
Bryan aren't like, really good
at this stuff so my dad helps me a lot.
This is Bobby, he does a
lot of our grounds work.
He's a green thumb and he knows how to do
everything when it comes
to plants so I'm like,
"can we do something like this?"
And then he basically was
like, "sure, let's do this."
So I love it.
It looks so cool.
You're all muddy!
- Yeah.
- That's so dirty!
Yeah, me and Bryan are really
good at having a vision
but we're not really good
at making things happen
so that's how it often works with, like,
if we have a fun idea for
the videos, we're like,
"we really wanna do something like this."
And then my dad always like,
builds it or makes it happen.
My dad and Bobby and me
and Bryan have all just
kind of been working
together to figure out
how we can make this yard just like,
fun and beautiful, relaxing, exciting.
Just like, something to do
in every part of the yard.
You know, swim, relax, play,
have a chicken coop, have a garden.
It's just amazing.
And we have big, big plans
for other parts of our yard.
It's just so exciting, huh?
We love our house.
And that's my little apron, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
- Apron.
- Yeah.
You guys, I think I see the starfish!
I've been waiting to see it
all day and I finally see it.
And I think we have
found a second starfish,
like baby starfish.
Let me show you.
Do you see the baby starfish?
- Yeah.
- Alright, so that's
the big mama starfish.
And look over here, in this corner.
That little tiny one.
Look at that.
That is the craziest
thing, that is such a baby.
And I swear I counted like all
the little lines right there.
It has like, seven legs.
That is insane.
And then, if you look down here.
Okay, it's kinda far away
but if you look straight
in the middle, there's a little
tiny, it looks almost white,
like tan-ish.
You can see like, a black star-ish.
I'll have to try and point
it out through the video
but that thing is moving and
it does look like a starfish.
And it's tiny, tiny, even
tinier than the one up there.
But, yeah, it is totally
moving and it is so small
and you can barely see
it but that's a starfish.
Another one, that's two.
And check this out, in just
the short amount of time
that we've been talking,
that thing moved from over
here to all the way over there.
That is the craziest thing ever.
I cannot believe we have baby starfish.
How neat.
Alright, guys, that is all for this vlog.
It's so, so late.
It's time for bed, huh?
You got those sleepy eyes on, huh?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna take my morning eyes off
and put my sleepy eyes on.
- Aww, his sleepy eyes.
Alright, guys, it is time for bed.
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.
Please give a big thumbs up if you did.
Hey look, that's my
hair hanging down there
and also that's hair a little bit cut out
because this guy got scissors, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he feels really bad.
He got in a little bit of trouble, huh?
But yeah, bunch of hair there and my hair.
So yeah, that happened.
Anyways, I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video.
And we will see you guys tomorrow.
What do you say?
- Bye!
-  Boop.
