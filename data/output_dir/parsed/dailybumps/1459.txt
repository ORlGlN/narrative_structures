are falling apart I can actually see my
foot that's my foot touching my foot
right now I need new shoes babe look at
this kid he's standing up like hey hello
I'm going to jump out of here should I
get him
I mean he's totally chill I don't want
him to fall though oh I mean he is
pretty dang good balance nowadays like
if he's got something I hold with one
hand as he's doing here we kind of want
him to like be just relax and just chill
in there for a walks we don't want to
like run to get him every single time he
cries he actually just grabbed his
blanket sat down
good morning guys I'm doing laundry and
I'm kind of waiting up for Ollie to um I
don't know it's not wake up cuz he's
sitting in his crib waking you know
awake but I'm just kind of waiting for
him to tell me that he's ready to get up
because he kind of fun he only slept for
like 30 minutes and I just wanted to
hang out in there I'm kind of bunks I
really wanted him to get a good nap in
um but I don't think that's gonna happen
cuz I kind of go soon everything is cool
when you're part of a team everything is
awesome when you live in our dream
this is such ok I know I listen to this
song a lot but I think what what it does
is it just lifts your spirit if you're
like in a bad mood or like you woke up
late or something just listen to this
song everything is awesome go search on
YouTube and it will just make you feel
better it does just how it is just makes
you feel better you want dance
everything is cool when you're part of a
team everything is awesome when you live
in a team I know 9 I'm up to save the
world
you like that there you go mmm that's
funny I am headed to get my hair done in
a few hours you're going to see well I
guess technically for a few minutes for
you a few seconds you're gonna see a
totally different Missy because I'm
going totally different not like
different from my past but more like
different from this I'm just kind of
over it I guess and it's just been a
long road with the ombre and I'm just
ready to change it up so really excited
I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do
but it's gonna be quite a shock but I'm
bringing my mom my Brian's a time with
his friend or something bringing my mom
to what helped watch oli he like I said
did not get a good nap so he's a little
bit grouchy hopefully this isn't a
disaster but I'm really exciting my hair
done I've been like itching to go to
this appointment for week snacks I just
really want to get my hair done I swear
I am the worst driver ever you guys like
the worst driver but I'm like so
horrible with directions right so I'm
headed to beat up to meet John and get
some lunch and I literally was just on
autopilot and I was like I had music on
and I was just thinking about things you
know that I have going on
and all of a sudden I was at the mall
and I was like that is not anywhere near
close of where it should be
oh my god I just got on all a pile and I
was because that's where we seen I are
always going we're always going in that
direction can you guys please make me
feel better and let me know in the
comments do you do that to autopilot is
the worst it when you're in the car
because I think I will literally be in a
turn lane and Missy will be like hey
where you going and I'll be like oh crap
and I almost like snap out of it and
then I'm like oh yes I'm going here so I
need to go this way but you know part of
the reason is I'm a guy and guys cannot
multitask girls on the other hand this
is why they make good mothers because
they're good at multitasking they can
cook dinner a dude series they can cook
dinner they can do laundry they can take
care of a kid all at once because they
can multitask whereas if a guy was doing
that it'd be a complete disaster I don't
have a mirror so I'm checking to see if
Jesus Lee this is just for you Brian so
don't put it in the book oh god it's
good making the vlog look at this sick
right oh my god
do you see this bro yeah so cool it's
what what is like a three-wheeler spider
yeah think baller got brakes on all okay
that is so cool Missy take a mental note
I want one of those
so Missy is getting her hair done right
now and I think I'm gonna buy a
highchair you've been looking at this
one because it's cool it's got like wood
and this thing comes off pretty easily
she's been begging me to buy it for like
past couple days now but we just haven't
had a chance to run down here and grab
it so I'm gonna get it for her and
surprise her but I'm she's really bad at
surprises so probably won't surprise her
very much there's really not that many
options but I don't really I'm not just
not into the whole plastic and like
metal ones you know I want like
something that looks nice and that's
like wood you know so we're gonna go for
this bad boy
this is awkward holding this and
vlogging but
got it excited and I hope she likes it
basically this gives me daddy points and
husband points I'm alright I know anyway
I should be leveling up alright so now I
gotta do is set this thing up should be
easy right and I text Missy and said how
much longer do you think she has and she
sent me a picture of this so I think her
hair is still coloring so I may have
time yeah this might be a little harder
than it seems and whoa here's my new
hair what do you guys think umm so yeah
I went really really really dark like a
I don't even know it's not black but
it's like a very dark chocolatey color
and then it's actually got highlights of
like the highlights but it's got like
this tinge of purple in it or like an
Auburn in it so in the light a burgundy
yeah so in the light can you see the
purple yeah a little bit a little bit
yeah this is really cool I really like
it's kinda it's like exactly what I was
thinking because I was just like um I
want this I don't know is she I just
heard like telling her what I wanted
she's like alright she like mixed all
these concoctions together and she made
this and I think it's really
cool-looking so here's my hair different
much different and it feels like
healthier to me but I really like it I'm
pretty much amazing I put this thing me
it was really easy actually to put
together and it's all set up now I put
this thing on loud boom hey ladies and
gentlemen we have a high chair that's
how you do it
oh we shot a bow or something I could
like slap on it I did have two screws
left over is that normal hopefully those
don't go in anything important
Missy's home look at it dang it's cool I
like it hey I barely seen you today like
why did you Nikki go in her
the worst trip ever did you not have fun
oh look why you're so weird
I try and surprise her and she's like
standing by the door forever well I
think we're just talking about my hair
no look what I did put it again I built
this thing with my own two hands Missy
so be careful when you put them in there
okay it's like her because you can
literally sit at the table with us
basically if I have his own little spot
what do you want to eat first time in
your high chair huh when you want to eat
hey I'm not food I want four oh my god
I'm like seriously love it Hey hi Holly
there's a piece of banana right in front
of you
yeah look at that look it look at that
look at that Oh pick it up pick up like
a big boy
in your mouth no smash it on the thing
so we just made a quick little target
trip so I'm playing this game I'm
probably really late to the game craft
to like guess what this picture is and
then these letters are so it's two words
I got to figure out what the heck this
is
please if you know what it is leave it
in the comments because I cannot figure
it out and work out this thing for date
also actually just posted a picture of
my new do and everyone seems to really
love it which I totally love it too but
I'm not kidding you and one more person
tells me that I look so much better I
don't know what I'm gonna do I really
don't know I mean yeah I'm gonna delete
the picture a second
it is like seriously I don't I don't
think people realize how rude that is
like tell me that I look way better like
I knew that like I look different look I
guess I could be prettier but I know no
you can't say that you can't say that I
look better or prettier or way younger
or wave dad like
people say things without thinking no I
just like everything that comes in I'm
like I love my hair I think I I've been
like thinking about this hair for a
couple months now and I was like I don't
really want to do it but I wanted to try
the Aubree out and I liked the ombre but
