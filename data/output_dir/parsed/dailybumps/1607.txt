house to look very father you know like
girls she likes to just get all get all
dhikr ad
I don't think that's a word so we are at
a craft store right now and I just
walked down the like nautical-themed
Akali the oli aisle yeah and um yeah
this I definitely could have gone even
further when it comes to his room but I
went pretty simple yeah my mom and my
sister and oli
are out we are looking because we're
decorating the house if you guys don't
know that's our mission we've been
working on that for the past few days
and we just need to figure out like a
couple frames and definitely want to do
like a little more of a fall theme we
don't ever decorate our house or
anything because it's just a lot of work
now to decorate it and then that season
goes away and then you got to redecorate
it and but I would like to get like a
couple things to make it look a little
bit more fall-like all right guys I'm
headed to go make a t-shirt order I just
went through all your orders while Missy
and I did this morning we got a great
look at this so ghetto we ran out of
print paper so I put on this lined paper
but I have like all the sizes and styles
and stuff so I'm gonna go get these
orders because I'm excited to see them
the store is just amazing like this is
ridiculous
Hobby Lobby has like everything you
could possibly think of and more like
they just they give you it's another one
of those inspirational like stores who
are always popular this is like the
coolest song ever I know if you guys
have heard it but it's by Mika it's
called popular song it's really kind of
different and cool I like music that's
different
popular i know about popular it's not
about who you are your fancy car
remember knew you were it's really cool
because it's about being popular and
about how that's like not like the best
thing to do when you're in high school I
think the goal is to be popular right if
you're not popular in high school you're
a loser and I was never one of those
people I was never one of the popular
kids I always had like a small group of
friends and actually my last years in
high school I really was only hung out
with Missy Missy and I were best friends
we cut class together it's all about
treating everyone equally because you
never know where people are gonna go you
know what about you know treating people
the way you want to be treated I think
that's I think that's a good message
there's a cool song so we're looking for
something that is gonna go above our
pictures and there's like all this like
one big happy family
since family it's is it the best place
to be is together and we're trying to
decide which one we like more there's
just so much there's so many cute little
sayings I got to show you this one how
cute this is this frame and dermal I'll
show you something I was like this would
be perfect in Ali's room although it's
not anchor themed her wanting to
safety-pin since we cost Ivor I just
thought it'd be so cute to have a safety
pin and I could like hang it right above
his diapers Oh that'd be so adorable
stay like Raggedy Ann old-looking it is
a hot day which means it's the perfect
day for bumper Janelle you have you boy
