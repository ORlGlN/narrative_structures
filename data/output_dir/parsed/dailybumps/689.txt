hey guys before today's vlog starts we
want to show you something really cool
that we produced in association with
mots medleys fruit flavored snacks we
actually had a ton of fun filming it and
it actually turned out really cute so go
check it out
oh man you guys it feels so good to come
together as a family after such a long
crazy day this is what it's all about
being together and doing stuff like this
right there perfect and then put it on
the paper big things to mots for making
this fun video happen now back to
today's vlog so I am getting ready this
morning if Finn is down for a nap which
is awesome sometimes it can be really
tough in the morning to get ready but
he's sleeping and now we got to do your
hair you little scraggly waggly boy yeah
you're juggling ugly and that was a nice
what ten five ten-minute nap yeah he
just took like a 10-minute nap that
didn't really help any of us I didn't
get really anything done you're lucky
you're cute
and I love you the cool thing often is
although he um doesn't take the best
naps all the time he can sit and play
for a little while so if I could find my
curling iron I could start coming my
hair and he probably could play the
whole time I'm selling my hair
all right Harris done I definitely did
not get as much curl in it as I was
hoping for
I'm not good at curling with a
straightener but I went ahead and just
like a little like top knot with my hair
down um all I even brought some toys in
for him to play with and you're just
playing here huh I'm your little blanket
that was very good at you okay a big
product that I want to get started today
is decluttering at my house a little bit
I've already started a tab on like the
kitchen because some of these cabinets
just had like way too many things and
then that we don't use and stuff because
there's actually a lot of areas in this
house that I really need to clean up
especially if we are going to be moving
soon I want that when the time comes to
actually start packing I don't have to
actually do clutter and pack I can just
pack everything let me check out this
closet not too bad I actually just
recently organized the closet so it's
not like terrible probably some things
in here that I can get rid of or throw
away or give away which is a lot of the
things I've been trying to do I'm trying
to do a lot of giveaway or take them to
like a goodwill or something like that

pretty much too cluttered laundry room
