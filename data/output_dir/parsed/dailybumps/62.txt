-  Good morning.
- It is time for school,
or almost time for school.
We gotta get ready.
-  Fred!
-  And they just walked out here.
What?
Why are you guys yelling Fred already?
- Look up.
-  (gasps) Oh my gosh!
What is he doing?
-  He's flying!
- He is like sliding down this string.
What is he gonna do with this tree?
Why is he swinging to the tree?
That's so crazy.
He look like he's like on a mission
and he's flying with Buddy, our reindeer.
Finn's just like um, come here, Fred.
I'll catch ya, huh?
Well, that was a fast finding Fred.
That's so funny.
All right, let's get
you boys some breakfast.
Mama is cold and tired.
But it's school day so I gotta
get you all ready for school, right?
- Yeah.
-  Let's go.
All right, Ollie is all ready
and he's off to school, right?
- Mm-hmm.
-  And who's taking you?
-  Papa!
- Papa's taking you.
He's so excited for Papa to take him.
Okay, you have a good day.
You just have a quick little short day
and then we're gonna
pick you up real early.
Is that exciting?
-  Mm-hmm.
-  Yeah.
All right, see ya later.
Finn, give him a hug.
Say bye.
- Bye bye.
- Good job.
Yeah, the school just has a half day today
because the kids actually
have a program tonight
and I am so excited.
Ollie will be getting up in front of stage
and singing a song with all of his friends
or all of his classmates and stuff
and I'm so excited.
But we have a really, really busy day
before that, basically.
So my dad offered to take Ollie to school
and we have to get going with our day, so
now you're riding the big horsie?
-  Ya.
-  Okay.
Can you even control it?
Wow, that's actually pretty good.
Go Finn, go.
Go Finn, go.
- Good morning, you guys.
Today is such an exciting day because
Ollie has his very first
performance at school.
They're doing like a
little Christmas program
with all the other preschoolers
and he learned a song,
a couple songs I heard.
He's gonna get to perform on stage
and it's gonna be the
first time that Missy and I
are getting to see anything like this.
So I'm super excited
to just be that parent
in the audience filming it
and it's gonna be really fun.
So super excited for that.
Also, where did the days go?
It's six days 'till Christmas you guys.
Are you ready?
Better be ready.
- We have been working
all day on the boys' room
and we're super excited.
It's not necessarily a surprise.
They've kind of heard us
talking about it here and there
about like them sharing a room and stuff,
but today we're doing it all.
Ollie's not home.
He's basically at school,
and then he's going to Mimi and Papa's
until it's time for his program.
Finn's seen a little bit,
but he's mostly been hanging out out here.
We're now eating some lunch,
taking a little break,
and look at his face.
Finn, let me see your face.
Oh my goodness.
He's been eating spaghetti
and I'm having some
leftover spaghetti as well
because we needed some food
before we get back to work, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
- All right, you guys.
We have acquired one Ollie.
Hi, Ollie.
- Hi.
-  How was school, buddy?
- Good.
-  Good?
And now we're back at school.
- Yay.
- So today is Ollie's Christmas program
and I am so excited to hear him
go up on the stage and sing.
Are you excited to sing on stage?
-  Yeah.
-  You too, Finn?
- Yeah.
- I don't think Finn's going yet.
But yeah, you're gonna go up there
and sing in front of everyone.
That's gonna be cool, huh?
-  Yeah.
- Hey Ollie, did you know
that daddy's done that before?
- Really?
-  Yeah, lots of times.
You got nothing to be afraid of, kay?
- Kay.
- You're gonna have a lot of fun.
I am so excited to hear him.
It's gonna be really, really
cool, so should be interesting
to see how it all goes.
- I know.
-  You know, I
was a little nervous,
but then he was like, "why
do I have to do it again?
I already did it today."
So I think they really walked
them through everything
and he's like, "what, I can do that.
It's not a big deal."
-  Yeah.
- I feel like he's gonna
be excited and do good.
- All right, we just dropped Ollie off
and we are so excited.
We are headed to grab a seat.
You ready, Finn?
- Yeah.
- We gotta get a good spot so
we can see your brother, huh?
- You gotta cheer really
loud for him, okay?
(Festive music)
-  Woo!
(Applause)
-  Yes, he did it.
(Festive music)
-  Merry Christmas!
(Applause and cheering)
- Christmas program just
ended and they did so good.
Good job, buddy.
Proud of you, dude.
Didn't he do so good, babe?
I actually heard him singing
- He was so cute!
-  When I was sitting in front
I said, "make sure you sing
really loud so I can hear you."
And he did.
- Yeah.
-  So cute!
- He loves it.
- The boy of the hour is here
and he got his candy cane!
- You got the rainbow
candy cane that you been
Talking about
- He's been talking about this
-  Rainbow candy can for a while.
You deserved it, buddy.
- Was that your prize for
singing and doing good?
- Yeah.
-  Hey Ollie, what
did you tell your teacher?
- That I have a Christmas album.
-  Really?
- You told him that you sing on an album?
Aww.
-  That's so cute.
Finn, give your brother a
hug and say, "good job!"
-  Oh, good job.
-  Give your brother a hug.
Oh, aww.
Good job, Ollie.
-  Where you going?

And Ollie is home for just a little bit
We have to get his jammies and stuff
before he actually is gonna
go spend the night with
- Mimi and Papa's house.
- Yay.
He's really excited.
He can't sleep in his room yet
'cause it is still a surprise
so hopefully tomorrow he gets to see.
Are you ready to open up Advent calendar!
-  Yeah.
- We have two, because we
didn't do one yesterday.
So it is actually six days till Christmas
but we get to open up this one.
There you go.
What's in there?
- I saw one.
-  What is that?
- Storm trooper.
-  Nice, good one.
Kay Finn, what is it?
This one right here.
What is it?
Oh, it's another little spaceship.
Let's hand that to uncle to put together.
All right, now it is the sum sum turn
and you get to open up,
Finn, actually not that one.
So handsy.
Oh, you actually have to open this one.
Seven.

Oh my goodness.
Who is that?

I think it is.
- Ya.
- Yeah, is that Baloo?
Here, let's open it.
Look at that.
Baloo, he's so cute.
Go show Mimi and make sure it is Baloo.
I'm just like not 100 percent sure.
All right, and then Ollie,
you get to open up the six
'cause it is six days 'till Christmas.
-  What'd I get?

All right, these boys got all their toys.
Oh, the storm trooper's
already taken apart.
Bye, Finn.
And then we've got this little boat.
We never know what these are, exactly.
I think they're like ships but
Finn's pretty
excited about it.
- This is not
-  A boat, Missy.
-  What is it?
- They do not have boats
in Star Wars.
- That's true, that's true.
-  They fly around in space.
- Okay, I guess it's just another
spaceship?
- So it's a spaceship
-  It goes (makes
flying sound effect)
- So many spaceships now and pieces.
-  No, that is a boat.
-  Oh, that one is so you're wrong.
All right, boys.
They're in their jammies and
they're all ready for bed.
-  Ho, ho, ho.
- Anyways, we had such a fun day.
It was kind of a busy one
and it was just so fun
getting to see you perform.
-  Yeah, dude.
I'm so proud of you.
High five.
-  You did so good.
It was so cute.
At one point, he was
like starting to zone out
and he was just like looking around like
why are we still doing this?
I was laughing so hard.
But then he got into again
and it was just so cute.
He even blew me a kiss from the stage.
- Oh, he did.
- Yes, isn't that cute?
Anyways, all right boys.
We gotta end this video.
So can you give it a big thumbs up?
- Thumbs up for the video.
Thumbs up!
-  Thumbs up, oh!

You're giving the little
candy thing a thumbs up?
-  Yeah.

We'll see you guys tomorrow.
What do you say, boys?
-  Bye. Boop.
