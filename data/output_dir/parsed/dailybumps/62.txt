-  We came home to Finn sleeping.
He's so cute when he naps.
Awww.
Honestly, though, if you've
ever taken a nap on our couch,
that's just what you look like.
That's what everyone looks like
when you take a nap on our couch.

- Good morning!
- Morning boys, did you guys sleep good?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Who's here with us?
- Uncle.
- Uncle!
Yeah, we actually all went
to breakfast this morning.
And now we are headed out,
well, me and Bryan are headed out
to go ride Nacho.
- Yeah.
- The boys are gonna hang out
with Uncle for a little bit.
- Happy.
- Happy?
- Yeah.
- I think Finn's saying he's happy.
But yeah, I'm excited I'm
finally gonna get Bryan
on the horse and I think it's gonna be
a really fun time.
It's just gonna be me
and him so super low-key.
No ones gonna be around,
like, making anyone nervous.
So it'll be really cool.
So you guys are gonna hang out with Uncle?
- Yeah.
-  Okay.
- Yeah.
- See you guys in a little bit, OK?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Yeah, be good for Uncle.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Hey, were back down at the barn.
- Yeah.
- This is me and Bryan
and we've got Nacho already out.
- So sweet.
- I haven't read comments
today to see what people
suggested for a name.
- Oh yeah, yeah.
- For a second name.
- We're still calling him Nacho.
- Yeah, Nacho's for now.
Maybe I'll end up connecting with it.
It does feel like his name
- Yeah.
- After I call him that for so long.
- I definitely feel a lot more comfortable
with him today.
Like, I've never been a big horse guy.
-  Yeah.
- They've always kind of
really intimidated me,
but he's a sweetheart.
-  He really is nice and this'll be
a great horse to get
him, like, comfortable
so that he kinda understands
the mannerisms of a horse.
- It was nice, too, just walking him.
-  Yeah.
- He keeps his head,
like, right next to you.
-  Yeah, he doesn't, like, pull
or walk away from you.
He's a great, good horse.
- Alright, we're gonna saddle you up.
- We're gonna saddle him
and get him all ready.
- I haven't been on a horse in so long.
- I'm gonna make Bryan do a bunch of stuff
so he can really, like,
get to know how it goes.
(bright music)
- So, hang on.
I'm working at a horse salon.
And obviously, what I'm doing
is brushing and cleaning.
(laughter)
-  Brushing his tail.
(laughter)
Didn't pull.
- Are you loving this, Nacho?
Is this awesome?
-  He says, "I'm a boy.
"Leave me alone."
- Yeah, he goes, "I wanna play."
He's so soft.
Alright, we are now cleaning Nacho's feet.
Apparently, these are his nails?
- Yep, his nails.
-  So weird.
He's got a lot of gunk in them.
- He's so great.
He just picks it up for you.
-  Alright, you
want me to try this one?
-  Okay, you want to do this one?
He's ready.
He's like, already leaning over.
-  Okay, what do I do?
-  Come on the side of it.
He just picks it up.
And you just...
Look at that.
Keep going, you can
really dig that nail in.
See the grooves?
- Mm Hmm.
It's so weird.
So weird, man.
This not who I am.
I am a city boy.
And I married a country girl.
This is really kinda funky.
-  Good job, though.
That looks clean.
Oh, here's Rolly.
He's out.
-  Alright, so Missy's
putting on his bridle.
And apparently he's
really stubborn sometimes.
- It's probably my fault, too.
I'm not, like, the best at doing it here.
-  Come on, dude, you got it.
Hey, good job.
- It's not his fault.
It's my fault.
I'm not the best at it.
-  Yeah.
So check this out, you guys.
We have the horse all saddled.
Missy showed me how to do everything.
And I've probably been walked through that
maybe once before in my life,
like when I was little.
But it's cool, like, we did it.
- We've got one little strap.
-  Yeah.
So this is the one that I got you
for Christmas, too.
- Yeah, and it's really
special's why I put it on.
-  Aww.
-  It looks good
hanging a little low,
not, like, choking him.
-  Okay.
- It's nice and comfortable.
-  So you put this
one on to get him ready,
and then you put this one on
when you're about to ride.
- Yeah.
-  So he gets,
like, an outfit change,
basically halfway through.
He's basically ready by now.
- Yeah.
Alright, I've got Bryan on the horse.
What do you think, Nacho?
He's like, "He's definitely a beginner."
He's like, "I can do whatever I want."
(laughter)
But Bryan's starting to kinda understand
how to give him rein.
Try and have him go left,
er, yeah sorry, right.
Turn his head.
There ya go.
Use that for pressure.
See?
And just tell him keep
going, you don't wanna stop.
Yeah, just do, like, a small
circle around me basically.
Just, there ya go.
Now tell him turn right.
You're doing it.
Ya starting to get it?
- A little bit, yeah.
(laughter)
-  A little
nervous, but, Nacho's like,
"I'm just trying to teach you what to do."
(laughter)
You look good up there.
- Thanks.
-  You look like a cowboy.
- Oh, do I?
-  Yeah.
Have him turn right.
You're doing it.
I'm proud of you.
(laughter)
He is kinda magnetic to me, huh?
- Yeah.
-  He just keeps
walking back to me.
- He's pulled to Missy.
-  Yeah.
It's actually kinda cute.
I love it.
I'm not gonna complain yet, but...
Alright, keep going a little bit more.
Good job.
You're doing it.
It's actually really cool to see Bryan
on my horse, but on a horse at all.
And maybe, if he gets comfortable enough,
and figures now we can
go trail riding together,
it should be really, really fun.
Come on. (clicks)
You're doing a pretty lazy walk.
(laughter)
- I feel like he's going 30 miles an hour.
(laughter)
-  You gotta go...
- Look at that, my hips
are going back and forth.
(laughter)
-  You could totally get him up to,
like, an active walk.
Just a little faster.
- No, not today, whoa.
-  He's like, "Okay, I'm back."
You're doing so good.
♪ They'll be coming around
the mountain when they come ♪
Yeehaw!
You really are doing so good.
Like, I really am proud of you.
- Thanks babe.
Nacho's had enough of doing pony rides
so Missy's gonna jump on him
and give him a little trot.
- He was great.
He would so have done
that a little longer.
- Yeah, he did good.
No, that was cool.
Saddle's definitely a little small for me
so it was a little painful, but, yeah.
Alright.
- Once I get you on one
of the other horses,
you'll have a more comfortable saddle.
-  Yeah.
(upbeat music)
- We just got back from the horse ranch
and now we are eating
some lunch, aren't we?
Say hey.
- Stop.
-  What'cha eating?
- Um, a peanut butter.
- Yep, we made sandwiches
because we were starving.
Missy actually ended up
going on a little trail ride,
which was really cool because
she got to take him out
for the first time ever.
And we came home to Finn sleeping.
He's so cute when he naps.
Awww.
Honestly, though, if you've
ever taken a nap on our couch,
that's just what you look like.
That's what everyone looks like
when you take a nap on our couch.
- It's so nice.
It's just about sunset.
The sun's, like, just starting
to go over that mountain.
And it's just such a nice time.
I'm actually just getting ready.
I put my shoes one, got my hat on.
I was gonna head out, do a
little bit of grocery shopping.
Like, we have stuff for dinner
but I kinda wanted to grab
a few more ingredients
even for the dinner and
just stuff for the week.
And I just walked out here with the boys
and I was like, "I don't
want to go anywhere.
"Let's just stay home and hang out
"and enjoy our evening, not leaving."
So, now we're not leaving,
we're gonna hang out, OK?
- Yeah.
- I mean, I was going to leave the boys
with Bryan anyways and go by myself,
and I was like, "I just
wanna hang out, too."
So now we're all just gonna hang out.
And Luna got the little flag that goes
on the top of the mountain.
And I think she chewed
off the part that goes in.
So now it's like, too fat
to actually fit in the hole.
- It can't.
-  Dang it, huh?
(cheerful music)
(upbeat pop music)
