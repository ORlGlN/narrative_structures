tiny baby boy he's gonna do amazing
things
good morning guys I have been doing all
kinds of stuff Oliver's taking a nap and
today he's taking an extra-long nap
which is so great because when he does I
can actually get things done you know
his normal these days have been like 30
minute nap like I literally it's so hard
to get him past 30 minutes I'm starting
to just think he's a 30-minute nap er
and that's it 30 minutes is just not
enough like I just get him down and then
I try and get ready and then he wakes up
right in the middle and so then it just
it messes with my day today he's going
on an hour and I was able to get
everything done I was able to get ready
I was able to start laundry fold laundry
clean up the room
I still got his toys out but I know he's
making up soon so what's the point
Oh in putting it all away hey guys so I
am making some guacamole and I know I've
said it before but I love that we live
in a place where we can literally get
like the freshest avocados year round
amazing thing about California so making
some guacamole and I'm actually using
this thing to like cut and scrape and
mash and it was sent to us by subscriber
a while ago but I use this thing all the
time it's awesome and it's like my
favorite color green tea and there you
have it ladies and gents fresh guacamole
yesterday we went to the CPK California
Pizza Kitchen and they have this
cuacamole that had like whole beans and
corn in it I think that sounds amazing
definitely something I'd want to try
this is pretty good too just plain old
wok
I think he's awake you ready to get him
can you hear him
Oh a stupid fan so scary huh boy wait
hang on cut turn the lights on good
mining superbug he slept forever how
long did you sing for I think II slept
for like an hour and 45 minutes
something like that
did you sleep all morning oh my goodness
okay not you it's not you to bed you
okay come on what are you doing in here
did you see really good you ready to get
up hmm see ya we need to play you guys
know how Missy's playing Albertsons
monopoly you buy things and they give
you like little stickers that you can
win things with well we went last night
and she figured out that you get one
sticker for every instant lunch a cup of
noodles that you buy he's only 20 cents
each so we bought ten for two bucks and
she got ten little things that she can
put on her map and I thought that was
just so funny because we don't really
eat these I mean they're good to have in
the house in case you're like starving
and you just want to throw it in
microwave actually used to eat these all
the time but these are like so bad for
you 1190 milligrams of sodium oh my god
my grandma would kill me it's not so
good on baby you seem so good it's great
because we actually are gonna go to
swimming today it's not technically
swimming lessons it's just like an open
swim and so I want to be rustics

and well-rested and ready to place your
pages Oh red room sleeping look at this

I like that you guys win yeah yeah bitch
drove in all my time on one's knees

learn to swim it and they're not doing
all that stuff like hanging on him

No okay here we go
don't need to do it Oh guys it's the
kick kick kick kick look at him kicking
you guys so when he kicks we actually
have to like a move him like he's

was so so tired so I'm glad I was able
to put him to bed last night was a
little rough he was giving me a hard
time um but I guess I'm just gonna kind
of hang out chill out and kind of paying
for myself normally me and Brian um you
know totally relax and hang out together
um and just kind of like watch TV and
play games and stuff but now that he's
gone kind of sad getting all set up
again we are finishing up vocals on the
cover that's gonna be on my channel it's
actually gonna be up on Thursday we're
finishing it today are you guys excited
yeah and this is so cool we got like the
whole setup here we got backlight got
the monitors we can check ourselves as
we're singing cameras all set up like
they'll set up and we're getting ready
I'm really excited to finish this
project but the cool thing is it's it's
actually going up the day before
Valentine's Day so when it comes out
share it and send it to the person that
you love okay that's that's what I'm
telling you guys got it okay also did
want to address a couple things a lot of
you guys have been asking questions
where are the 15 minute vibes where did
they go we're just kind of trying
something out we thought we'd you know
experiment a little bit with the vlogs
and the times and so what we like and
see what the viewers like and the
numbers are like and all that I want to
say that you're not missing anything for
the you know of course obviously we only
put so much in the vlogs anyways we
don't film every single thing we do I
wouldn't say that we're filming any less
we're just gonna cut try and compact it
a little bit more into a 10 minute vlog
I do think that there's a lot of people
out there who don't necessarily
I have time to sit down and watch 15
minutes and we know that our core
subscribers or our core followers are
always going to watch whether it's 20
minutes or 10 minutes or whatever but we
want to kind of reach out to those who
maybe you don't necessarily have 15
minutes to sit down and watch I don't I
know I don't always have 15 minutes so
we're just kind of experimenting and
hopefully you guys can be supportive in
that okay got all the way back to bed
anyways just want to let you guys know
that's kind of why we're doing the 10
minute vogs right now but I do want to
thank everyone who's being supportive
either Whigs I know you guys love us and
you just want to see us and that's what
we're trying to make happen and just
trying to figure out what works best for
us and everyone else I'm getting ready
for bed just cleaning up and gotta go do
the dishes and stuff like I said I'm
gonna take a shower
relax uh probably much like a girly
movie that I don't get to normally watch
with Brian since he doesn't have to
watch uh romantic was they usually like
a romantic comedy or something
Brian's at the studio he says he's gonna
be there all night so I really hope he's
not gonna actually be there all night he
said he's just been recording in time
and all that so I'm gonna go ahead and
end the vlog so give it a big thumbs up
if you enjoyed it of course all I was
adorable today in that swing pool like I
said I'm gonna watch a movie a girly
movie so leave in the comments below
your favorite romantic movie and if it's
something I haven't seen it I'm gonna
have Brian download um one of the ones
that you guys mentioned because I want
to watch something on Valentine's Day
