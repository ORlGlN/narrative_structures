that's amazing I guess there's some
places I would feel uncomfortable
we're under this really nice is this a
willow tree yeah that's kind of Camilla
tree what kind of tree is this you guys
leave it in the comments if you know a
couple days ago we announced our daily
bumps march site and one of our main
goals was was to have a product that we
offered where we can give the profits to
this horse ranch something that like
Missy is like really passionate about he
wanted to work toward actually
sponsoring a horse and because of you
guys buying the car McKay's like we have
karma iPhone designs that we've been
doing all the cases because of you guys
we've actually raised enough money to
sponsor a horse and hopefully keep it
going Missy's actually gonna sponsor a
horse and she's got to decide I think
you want these horses maybe safe and
like I'm here in this sanctuary in this
ranch that they put together but that's
not the end I mean it costs a ton of
money to keep this place going one of
the guys was telling me that he actually
was at an auction for one of the horses
one of the black ones up there and he
was saying that the slaughter he was
bidding against the slaughterhouse
essentially the slaughterhouse was
trying to outbid this guy to get the
horse because they actually slaughter
the horses and then they sell the horse
meat to like Asia and other countries
yeah like that is the career I've never
heard of that sapphire oh that's
sapphire you guys know sapphire Missy
has like a huge connection with sapphire
if you guys go to our March store and
you buy those karma cases it's
contributing to them and if you guys
don't want to buy the case and you just
want to contribute you definitely can do
that too and I'll put a link in the
description so that you guys can donate
any little bit even if you guys donate a
buck to like help feed these horses that
helps so we're gonna play with your
frisbee huh all right here we go
but I heard a little bit too fast for
him so he has a hard time catching it
but he that just means he's got to get
faster whoa good job you got it
then uh-oh he's gotta get her kisses in
she's gonna go to yoga you could yo gun
I'm headed to yoga and the funny thing
is I'm a few guys remember but last week
I was really upset so I went to yoga and
I walked in it like at 6 o'clock when
class starts and the door was locked and
I was like so upset like I just couldn't
get over it so anyways I love my yoga
teacher a lot of you were like dunk that
yoga teacher and go somewhere else
but I loved my yoga teacher like I'm
she's so cool so I actually I'm friends
with on Facebook and I was like um I
walked into class and the door was
locked
she's like the door doesn't lock she's
like he's just got to push it open okay
I'm telling you guys I really tried but
I just I think that part of me was like
holding back because I I knew that like
she had just started class and I didn't
want to like a fake breaking down the
door you know this time I left just a
teeny tiny bit earlier hoping that we'll
make it way I'm listening to Christmas
