- Ollie we made it to Disney Land
and who do you see?
Whoa okay, this one's really scary.
Oh my gosh.
Oh my gosh!
You're finally big enough!
You can go on this ride Ollie.
- That's so cute.
A baby bear!
That's so cute!
-  Hello!
- Good to see you my friends.
♫ This is our life
♫ This is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream
♫ This is our team
♫ Shine among the stars
♫ Take this shield and we'll all be fine
♫ Take this hand and we'll all just shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
- Good morning Finn.
Where are we goin' today?
(mumbling)
Disney Land!
We're goin' to Disney Land.
We're so excited huh?
'Cause Mimi and Papa and
uncle are comin' with us.
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be so fun.
And Finn has already
started another twirl.
I cut one out a few days ago.
I cut one out yesterday, like last night.
And I'm gonna have to cut another one out.
I think I'm just gonna
have to cut his hair.
Because he just keeps making huge knots.
We're going to Disney Land
and this guy's so excited too.
- Yeah 'cause the Disney Land. (mumbles)
It's out now!
-  It's open again huh?
- Open!
- Yay, he's so excited.
Last time we went to
Disney Land it was closed.
And he was so sad.
But it's open now huh?
And Mimi's comin' with.
- Yay.
- Yay.
And we're off.
Uncle's ridin' with us.
The boys are all ready.
We debated between this and the truck
'cause the truck does have movies
that they can watch but,
the Volvo is just a lot easier
to drive than the truck.
So I went ahead and I'm taking the Volvo,
my parents are taking the truck.
And we're all headed to Disney Land,
it's gonna be such a fun day!
Yay!
Alright so we are on
our way to Disney Land.
Finn is a little upset right now.
But I thought I'd tell you guys,
if you didn't know, there
are some major fires
down in Southern California.
And there actually is one
pretty close to Disney Land.
We checked the air quality,
and it says that it's moderate.
So I don't think that's too bad.
But just coming down into the valley,
Finn's really upset.
You can like literally see
just like a haze of smoke.
And it's really kind
of like eerie looking,
it's kind of weird.
Alright so we are driving
passed a lot of the
Anaheim Hills fires that
were on the freeway.
And this is so scary.
Like I can't believe
how close this fire was
to where we're driving right now.
And you can see more up
here even close to like
houses and stuff.
Ollie we made it to Disney Land,
and who do you see?
- Ariel.
- Ariel.
Now she's not in her mermaid outfit,
she's in her dress.
But she still looks beautiful huh?
- Have a flower.
- She has her legs on.
- Yeah she has her legs on today.
So cool.
We made it!
Everyone's so excited.
In the park, they haven't gone in a while.
- I haven't been like, I feel
like it's been about a year.
- We're gonna have a fun day here.
And we definitely have to meet,
who do we have to meet today?
- Jack Skellington.
- Yeah.
He really wants to meet Jack Skellington.
And I'm making it number
one on my priority.
Look at the Storm Troopers!
How cool is that?
He seems pretty excited to
meet the Storm Troopers.
- Very cool!
- Very cool!
Hey Ollie, maybe we should
see if you're tall enough
to go on the Star Wars ride.
Should we see?
Okay.
Oh my gosh.
- Hang on.
-  Oh my gosh!
- Oh you're tall enough!
-  Oh my god!
You're finally big enough!
You can go on this ride Ollie.
- You're not even standing up straight.
-  Stand up straight.
- You bumped your head.
-  He's tippy-toeing.
-  I think that counts.
- I think he's in.
-  Spike his hair up.
-  Finn, you got a
little bit more ways to go,
okay bud?
Maybe next year?
Maybe in a couple years.
Alright we're goin on our first ride.
Mimi's got Finn, uncle's got Ollie
and here we go.
We're goin' on the rocket ship.
We seem to be going on this one a lot.
Okay, okay.
Whoa, okay, this one's really scary.
(upbeat music)
Ollie you finally get to go on Buzz huh?
And you're goin' with Papa?
Alright you defeat Zerg okay?

He's so happy.
Are you ready Finn, sit on your bottom.
Here's your gun.
Get him.
Shoot him Finn, shoot him.

- Oh okay.
Well I beat all of you.
Me and Jimmy, came in a close second.
- Did you get the Zerg, 100,000 points?
- I think so.
Yeah I got 148.
Did you get 138?
- Yeah 133.

Alright Ollie, who are we in line for?
- Jack Skellington.
- You're gonna finally meet him?
And you know who else is there?

You luckily got a spot in line
and it is crazy.
Jack is like everyone's top priority huh?
Look at him,
he think he looks so cool.
Are you gonna see Jack Finn?
Are you excited?
- Yeah.
- He was scared of Captain
Hook the other day.
So I'm not sure how he's
gonna react to Jack.
Ollie do you see him yet?
Not yet.
He's over there.
Do you see him Finn?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Does he look scary?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
He's like I'm not sure.
It's almost your turn Ollie.
Alright baby, you're turn.
Go up there first.
Go say hi.
Hello.
- Good to see you my friends.
I love the red--
- Go say hi.
- Costumes.
You were out batting today.
-  Finn do you wanna come say hi?
Do you wanna go say hi?
- No.
- No.
Wow.
You look so cute.
Alright should we do a family picture?
Do you want to give Jack a high five?
No.
Do you want to give Sally a high five?
No.
- That's okay, my hands might fall off.
You never know.
- It could happen.
- Say bye Jack, bye Sally.
-  Bye Jack.
-  Ollie what
did you think of that?
- It was good.
- What did you think of that?
You were kind of scared huh?
Bye Jack.
Wow, that was so neat.
On my gosh that was the cutest thing ever.
Not only does Jack talk.
But Ollie got to interact
with him and like,
told him his name and
oh my gosh it was just,
so so cool.
I think Ollie loved it.
I think it's something
he will never forget.
Because it was so cute.
And Finn was so cute.
He like knew who Jack was,
but he was like, you're
a little scary in person.
I was like give him a high five,
he's like no, no I'm not doing that.
So cute.
Did you guys like meeting Jack?
-  Yeah.
- Yeah, was that so neat?
That was so cool.
Daddy wishes he was here so badly.
He wanted to take him.
But he also really wanted
Ollie to meet Jack.
So we did it anyways.
But maybe daddy can come next time kay.
And you can meet him with daddy.
Alright Ollie, guess what?
- What?
- You get to go on your
very first, big boy ride.
And you know which one it's gonna be?
- What?
- Soaring Over the World.
You get to fly over the world.
Are you excited?
Are you scared?
- No.
- No.
- Oh my gosh we're so excited!
- But is it scary?
- It's not scary at all.
So as you guys know,
we learned today that he's big enough
to go on some of the big kid rides.
One of them is soaring.
There's Star Tours and he can
even go on Space Mountain.
I think we're gonna save
those ones for next time.
But right now we're gonna go on Soarin'.
And we're so excited!
So uncle and Papa and Mama are taking
them on Soarin' right now.
Yay!
Alright let's just double check it again.
Stand up.
Oh gosh, okay.
- That's close
You're right there.
We'll see if they let you.
I'm like so scared.
Because he's like, he is 40 inches.
But he's just like right there
and you never know if
they're gonna be like,
no not this time.
So we'll see.
(quirky music)

And so I'm so excited for
them that he gets to go again.
He loved it!
I am sitting here entertaining Ms. June!
And Finn's gettin' in there.
Okay, hop on out.
Should we do the clappy hands?
If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands.
Yay!
If you're happy and you

entire time I'm watching her.
If you're happy and you

- A little bit.
-  A little bit.
So is that one your favorite ride now?

I think he means the Halloween ride.
So is Halloween better than Soarin'
or do you like Soarin' better?
- I like Soarin' better.
-  Oh he likes
Soarin' more than Halloween.
Haunted mansion.
Alright guys, we have decided
to head out of the park.
We had a ton of fun.
We did a ton of stuff.
But it actually is a pretty busy day.
And if we wanted to stay any longer
we'd have to be like in a ton of traffic
and we'd get home super late.
My parents are actually
taking the boys home.
Which is super nice of them.
They're just the best parents ever.
And I'm actually gonna
go meet up with Bryan.
Because he is at a conference right now
with a lot of our friends.
And it's a pretty cool conference
that is all about YouTube and all that.
And so I thought I would meet up with him
for the night.
And then I'm gonna be back with the boys,
tomorrow morning,
or I may even go home tonight.
But we will see.
But yeah, I'm gonna head there now.
It's a lot of traffic
already going there so.
It's gonna be a long drive.
- Everyone party in the elevator!
- Elevator party!
- Elevator party!
Carl!
We are with everyone.
The whole crew.
We got--
- My dad.
-  We got Corbin.
We got Carl and Jinger.
And Missy is joining us now.
Oh we're going out.
Oh yeah, we're going to get snacks.
We're sneaking up to the club level
to see if we can get some snacks.
So we had a full day of education.
Right Darren, right Carl?
We learned a lot.
Now we all get to hang out and have fun.
And Missy is coming from Disney Land
to hang out with us,
and I'm really excited.
We have arrived.
Ooh pasta, what's in there?
Whoa chicken!
- Oh my gosh,
it's like a legit dinner.
-  Yeah.
Appetizers.
(laughing)
What are you doing?
-  Making it so
you can see yourself.
-  Oh I can see your perspective.
Okay, just so you guys are all wondering,
this is Missy's perspective of
me walking down the hallway.
(laughing)
Missy's here.
Hey babe.
You ready to party in your Mickey shirt?
- Yeah.
