he loves this good afternoon everyone we
are off to get lunch we run to get some
food the wonderful food in our bellies
yeah I put up to Brian to decide what
we're having for lunch because we are
pretty much past the point of starvation
I'm are going grocery shopping today
Yesi I know we're doing that today I got
a small on yesterday but it definitely
was just like a couple things and really
had nothing for breakfast all he had
breakfast he's good
we're just starving we're gonna do some
errands today I'm excited it took me a
fun day and if you guys all know my
surgery is on Friday it's happening for
you guys it's tomorrow so I'm getting a
little bit nervous as I get closer to
the actual date
it's a little nerve-wracking but I'm
also excited to get it over with but
yeah just oh that's
so surgery no matter what it's really
scary so I'm starting to get to that
point where it's something like a it's
happening it's gonna happen xud and so I
I really have nothing to really be
afraid of other than if something crazy
happens and I mean it is my uterus and
if you like messes it up then I could
potentially not be able to have kids
anymore and that's a really really scary
thought but that's very very rare that's
not really I really don't think that's
going to happen so but those words have
been put into my head in the past he's
told me like you know this could risk
you know you not be able to get pregnant
or Bowl on so those are really really
scary things to think about and now that
I'm getting closer those words start
coming back into my head like okay that
is a possibility you know I I really do
have confidence in my doctor and I'm
just ready to get it out for us really
hey Brian had started on yellow basket
this is not the my most popular place to
go to but it's not bad I mean it's just
like chicken and sandwiches and stuff
like that I have a hard time letting
people decide what I'm gonna eat but the
songs are good or a little cold front
that we've been having is actually over
and Missy is still dressed the part I
never dress at the right to not dress
properly so I'm in my house I think it's
cool
so I leave and I have this on and I'd
regret it it's gonna be like 85 today
yeah I'm already like all he looks cute
though hey buddy what are you doing he's
getting old enough where we can just
sort of set him next to us in a booth
and he just chills out on his own
piggy oh dear god what are you drinking
there when you got near miracle 360 cop
you like that thing he is excited today
you guys don't you wish you can wake up
with that much energy how do you want to
play a game
Oh
oh you got to get it to the edge okay Oh
without going over
I look at this one kodachi oh no don't
eat it
does anyone else play this game where
you try and take the packet and you have
to get it hanging off the table like
this do you remember we used to do this
Missy oh that was weak
Oh does that count
all these right now I just ran into
Macy's to grab a couple cooking things
because I'm gonna start doing like
cooking videos on my channel which I'm
really excited about and I grabbed this
professional baked earth non-stick
baking mat and it's on a Silpat it's
like a soap okay
it's really cool because you can bake
cookies on it and they're obviously
nonstick and there's just it's like it
feels amazing it's like this silicone II
really cool texture and I'm really
excited to make cookies up I Ren use it
a lot I got a bunch of other like really
cool little items in there so I'm really
excited to start doing baking videos
because it's actually something I really
enjoyed doing excited until I get to
show you guys some cool recipes that I
like to bake and see if you guys like
doing to and plus it's like baking
season so it's like perfect timing
alright well that was kind of a fail I
knew it wasn't gonna last she put it all
this paper bag I was like this is so
heavy it's gonna tear it tore and then
this nice little pie pan miss you got
fell and completely broke so now we have
to go back but yeah look at that it was
a disaster good thing we did it like
leaving we're out in the parking lot so
we're supposed to be grocery shopping
but we got distracted by all of the
Christmas decorations babe we gotta go
all out this year we have our own place
you know oh cool it's like a little
advent calendar right you put a little
treats in it I wish Ollie could open
these up they're a little hard to open
up you know like he would have so much
fun opening these up they look at these
little trees oh yes let's get this when
can we start counting down yeah you know
and everyone always says Thanksgivings
coming up yeah we love Thanksgiving too
and you can have everything decorated
for Christmas during Thanksgiving yeah
it goes holy I love they see me I'm not
skipping Thanksgiving I just celebrate
and I can see cuz as you look at this
goal this looks like something leggy
Lady Gaga would have in her house babe
that is really cool
I got glitter all over with me the First
Noel the angel did see this is cool he
loves it that is so cool I'm so excited
to see him around Christmastime are you
excited he's gonna be running around
Missy Missy we have hit the mother lode
it's not my gosh look at the trees
there's trees and ornaments this is so
cool
Missy I'm just saying that tree would
fit because we have that really tall
room we can get any tree we want
ornaments oh my gosh I love Christmas
you guys I love Christmas so much and
this is what's left of Halloween in the
sad like empty shelves and clearance
clearance get it out of here they need
to extend the Christmas stuff this way
we went grocery shopping this is what
grocery shopping looks like after we
unpack I just like actually really sad
when you think about how many plastic
bag you know it's really bad I I just I
really should start buying the reusable
ones I just haven't gotten around to it
and I just can't imagine about money I
would need I think we need to do it soon
because I'm pretty sure they passed the
ordinance in Riverside County that it's
illegal to start carrying plastic bags
so yeah I think stores are gonna have to
force people to do it yeah I did hear
that I mean I think they did change the
law that I don't know how much it will
go into effect because it can be quite
inconvenient but they might start
charging to use plastic bags that'd be
weird okay you gotta eat your dinner you
guys being a little bit picky tonight
which is always not fun
yeah you bomb you this medicine and you
didn't have the cap so I'm using an
actual fireball shot glass to take my
medicine while is not like the wrong
amount no I'm filling it up the right
now I guess it didn't come with a little
glass to drink it hey hey what are you
doing
come inside eat all the stuff he keeps
dropping on the floor you okay you okay
enter time can be a little bit stressful
sometimes but it's always like hittin
assistants sometimes dinner it's just
like perfect needs whatever I give him
and some nights like tonight he puts his
feet on the table and this I feel any
nothing or smears the spinach everywhere
yeah he did just white brand-new table
he did just do that he just smeared it
all his food
I was pretty nasty I just got done
filming a video which is funny because I
never film videos at nighttime I always
film during the day like without fail
number one I can't film at night because
I get really really really red eyes and
so it's kind of embarrassing so I just
feel like I look so so I just have
lights in here and I actually just got
done filming a video going to be up
today because actually on Wednesday I
didn't do a video because on Tuesday I
was just so tired and no I just started
vlogging I feel like I just started
walking and telling you stuff but I
didn't really have a point to say that
does no I'm going to stop bugging though
O'Brien's still filming b-roll too
technically I should be helping him do
this but but I'm vlogging I wanted to
show you guys how in tomorrow's video
you'll see that I somewhat look cute
with my shirt in my scarf but what you
don't know is what I'm wearing down here
just pajama bottoms I just thought that
was funny because I normally don't do
that I kind of just throw on this shirt
and I just kept wearing my pajama
bottoms
it's not funny Brian yeah I'm a my lazy
youtuber no you can't see us or am I
just a typical YouTube youtuber just
eggs do all youtubers just wear nothing
oh you first either I just finished
editing Missy's video this is what I
stared at the entire video right her
cute face mmm then there's this I've
been wanting to play this Missy pick
this up for me yesterday when I wasn't
feeling very good and I really want to
play it but I just haven't had time as
far as being sick I am feeling better
today I feel like my congestion is like
really getting a whole lot better so
that's really good so hopefully tomorrow
I'll be close to a hundred percent yeah

a fun little announcement in it as well
