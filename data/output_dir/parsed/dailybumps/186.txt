- Ollie, you better be
cleaning your play room.
- Okay Momma.
(upbeat music)
- That looks good.

I cleaned my play room!
♫ This is our life this is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream this is our team
♫ Shine among the stars
♫ Tae the shooting stars take
this hand and watch it shine
♫ This is our life let's live it
♫ Living for your fam
-  Good morning!
- Hey guys, so what did you
think, the new intro babe?
- It's pretty cool.
- I'm so excited.
- It's super different but
yet still our same style.
- It's short and sweet and
to the point too, which a lot
of you wanted.
And a new song and a new
animation, I think it's cool.
- I really like intros, I
know people have different
opinions on them and
personally I think it's cool
that people can watch our
show or watch our videos
and know who we are
and what our names are.
- Before it technically starts.
- So I'm not offended if
you guys skip it but I love
the intro and I think it's
important for us to have.
- No we worked hard on
that intro and you need to
watch it every single time!
- Yes watch it every time!
- Every single time!
Anyway what's up guys?
Today we got the whole damn
fam over, oops I did it again.
I Brittany'd it'.
- But Auntie is not here and Ollie was
pretty upset about it.
- Alright Mimi what are we doing today?
- Alright we're gonna do some
carne asada, kind of fajita,
kind of asada, I don't
know, what's the difference?
I don't know, tell us in the comments.
-  We have some veggies to stir fry,
we've got meats.
