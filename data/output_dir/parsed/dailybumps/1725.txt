okay it's green I can go you guys are
watching this it's green and I'm going I
could pulled over for turning on green
good morning everyone
so me and my mom are headed off to a
doctor's appointment but before I go as
you can see my hair is an absolute wild
crazy mess on days like this I usually
do something to my hair that's just like
my lazy hairdo but everyone always
freaks out and they always want to know
what the heck did I do with my hair why
is it look so cute and they want to know
how to do it and so I'm going to show
you it's super super easy this is
basically just the hairdo I do when I
just didn't straighten my hair and I'm
really really lazy okay so as you can
tell I just pinned my bangs back but you
don't have to split my hair it does not
have to be perfect then I take this and
I start with one little piece and I cut
it in half and then I bring this piece
over here over and I just start grabbing
pieces and I bring them together the
French twist so you just take it and you
bring it over now you've got this tie on
over here and then I just grab a piece
and then just bring it over doing this
until all my hair is out there's that
and then I will usually use something to
hold it in place while I do the same
thing okay the other side huh oh and
then just keep doing that until you're
out of hair okay so now I just got like
this you could just do it and it could
be down like a ponytail I usually put it
up in a bun so I'll do this I guess I'm
crazy however you want to do your hair
so it's in a bun that's pretty much how
I do it but then I'm going to take a
couple of bobby pins and just kind of
hit it so that it looks a little bit
cuter and like I did it so that's what I
do is my hair when I'm like super lazy
super fast and it puts always that I
don't have to look at it money guys so
last night I wore my Fitbit when I was
sleeping and I had to track my sleep it
basically told me it you know I slept
for seven hours and I was awake
12 times I don't know if that's normal
but like it basically said that I was
restless the little blue the light blue
bar
are restless so basically awake and
that's 12 times sometimes for like five
minutes at a time I wonder like what
that could be from if you guys have any
suggestions about that let me know in
the comments because that's a lot of
times being restless in one night asleep
12 times we are headed to an appointment
I actually had appointment with my
doctor but my mom got an appointment
with the spinal surgeon we've been
trying to get ahold of him for like ever
and he finally said if you want to come
come now so I went ahead and rescheduled
my appointment so that I could take her
to the spinal surgeon and hopefully get
things figured out don't forget back
shut the door get out go peace just
dropping Cassie off at school she it's
actually like noon but she's got finals
to do down here and I supposed to have a
meeting down here at work in like an
hour and a half but now I get to go back
and then come back then when I grab some
lunch
cuz I'm pretty starving and I've just
been munching on wheat thick's tomato
base weakens actually and they're
amazing they're so good I did not think
that they were gonna be that good but
I'm like I got a I got I have to portion
let's drop the camera but I have the
portion myself or else I'm in the whole
box so I just got home and Missy's still
not here
nice tie her she was getting
Wienerschnitzel with her mom but she's
still not here I wonder where she's out
anyway I'm here and I get to be here for
like 15 minutes and I got to leave from
a meeting but I grabbed a flat bread
sandwich at Subway and it's not that
good a flat bread is cut it's like
there's at least is like kind of chewy
and like kind of tough
caramel eat it though I'm not giving to
you I feel bummed because I haven't seen
Missi like all day but I just talked to
her and I guess her and her mom are like
in and out of appointments all day which
means a lot of driving here in
California so that kind of sucks but
hopefully after my meeting I can
actually
I see my wife it sucks three days like
these especially it was like she works a
lot I work a lot I feel like we do get a
lot of time together but when we don't I
feel like I am like constantly missing
her we are done with our doctor's
appointments well actually we do have
one more a little bit later we finally
made an appointment with our actual
surgery appointment but it's for a month
away
June 18th which is actually my mom's
anniversary which kind of sucks but at
the same time it doesn't really matter
because we just want to get her fixed so
we're kind of scared because I'm gonna
be eight months pregnant at that point
and we really don't want to push it and
be going that close to my due date but
obviously we booked it and then if we
can get a sooner one then we'll
definitely take that another waiting
room we're so done with this I've been
in waiting rooms like all day we're so
tired we're both wearing Armani shoes I
really comfortable nice and swishy
I feel aggressive my manicure pedicure
that tree right there my act might look
like a real tree with feathers
how does that work and branches and
feathers coming out so I just got out of
my meeting and this is kind of funny I'm
at the same intersection that I turned
right on red and I got a ticket a couple
of locks Akiho and it's actually 257 and
it says no turn on red Monday through
Friday 3 to 4 can I turn on red I mean
it's 3 minutes I don't think that I'm
going to take that risk even though it's
2 minutes ok it's green I can go you

I'm going I get pulled over for turning
on green I'm gonna be I'm good we're
