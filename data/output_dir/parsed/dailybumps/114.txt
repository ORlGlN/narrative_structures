Happy Thanksgiving babe!
- Happy Thanksgiving.
-  What are you doin'?
- I'm setting the kids' table with these
cute little kids' forks,
and knives, and spoons.
- Aw.
- They're so cute.
- Yeah.
- I don't know how CJ
is gonna feel about them,
but I think they're adorable.
- This is our first year with
an official kids' table, huh?
- Uh huh.
- So it's gonna be so cool,
so all the kids are gonna be
situated on the kids' table,
which is directly adjacent
to the adult table,
which we're also gettin' set up.
- It's like a kid friendly fancy dinner.
- Yes.
- They get their own
little place settings,
- Check this out.
This is where Finn's gonna be sitting.
(laughs)
And it is not going to look
like this for very long.
- Yeah (chuckles).
(upbeat instrumental music)
- Happy Thanksgivin'!
-  Happy Thanksgivin' buddy.
What do you got there?
(electronic swishing)
Whoa, a sword?
- Yeah.
- That's so cool.
Happy Thanksgiving guys.
You guys excited to eat some yummy food?
- Yeah!
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
You guys all just playin'?
(laughs)
All right, keep playin' guys.
(Finn talking loudly)
Good morning, Finn.
Or should you be saying,
"Ho ho ho?"
- Ho.
- You look like Santa Claus.
Aw, gettin' cuddles from
little baby Santa Claus,
you guys.
Finn is gettin' in the spirit
of Christmas, aren't you?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
(upbeat instrumental music)
-  Happy
Thanksgiving boys and girls.
(upbeat instrumental music)
Ollie, what sound does a horse make?
(neighing)
Okay Bailey, what sound does
the unicorn make, though?
- Yee yee yee.
- Are you sure?
(laughing)
Alright you guys, we're
still cookin' all our food
and I think some more family's coming.
But, I wanted to prank the
kids with this turkey mask
and see what they think (chuckles).
It makes it look like there's
an actual turkey on my head.
Check this out.
(laughing)
Look at it, it even has
two little eye holes
down by the breast.
Let's go see what the kids think.
Happy Thanksgiving you guys.
It's been a good day.
Rawr!
Ollie, can you help me?
I have this turkey stuck on my head.
Can you help me take it off?
(crying loudly)
(laughs)
Help, help!
This turkey's stuck on my head, Bailey!
- Is that a real turkey?
- Yes, it's stuck on my head.
Feel it.
See, it's a real turkey.
(Bailey laughs)
It's stuck on my head you guys.
Karma, help me!
- Come here!
- I know how to get it off.
- You know how to get it off?
- Ahh!
- I got it off!
- Freedom!
(laughs) Thanks Bailey boo.
Ollie, it was just Dada.
Aw, he's scared.
It's okay.
Ollie.
(whining)
It was just Dada, buddy.
Did I scare you?
- Yeah.
- Yeah (laughs).
Well, if you thought a
turkey was on my head,
why didn't you help me get it off?
Huh?
- Because.
- 'Cause (laughs).
Daddy didn't get a
turkey stuck on his head,
although that would be quite funny.
(growls)
(woman shrieks)
Hey, I got a turkey stuck on my head.
Can you help me take it off?
- And, and, um.
- Can you help me take it off?
Help me take it off?
So far, you're not that good at it.
Bailey could do it.
Oh, okay.
Should have put more butter on it.
(laughs)
- You want that turkey?
- No.
-  I really scared Ollie.
He was so scared (laughs).
- Oh really?
- He was crying.
I felt bad.
Alright you guys, as you
know, it's Thanksgiving
and what is Thanksgiving without a turkey?
We need to cook a turkey tonight.
We're having a lot of people come over.
We're feeding about 20
people, so we need to find
a big turkey bird, and I think I heard one
runnin' around the house.
- Gobble, gobble, gobble.
(gobbling)
- Gobble gobble.
Gobble gobble.
Gobble.
- You guys, there's a turkey
loose in the house.
- Gobble gobble.
(gobbling)
-  There's a turkey
loose in the house you guys!
- Oh no!
- There's a turkey!
-  Randy, grab the turkey, come on!
You guys, we need a
turkey tonight for dinner.
Oh we got a turkey--
(gobbling)
- Gobble gobble.
- We got a turkey runnin'
around the house, you guys.
- We have to get her!
- We gotta get that thing so we can put it
in the oven, CJ!
Oh no!
- Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble!
(gobbling)
-  You are a good lookin' turkey.
It's time for dinner.
(growls)
Ah!
The turkey's eating me!
Thanksgiving has taken a
turn for the worst everybody!
Ah!
(happy squealing)
- Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.
-  Get back here!
Get back here, turkey!
(kids talking loudly)
Get 'em Baily, get 'em!
Get 'em, bring 'em down!
Bring 'em down!
Ah!
- We caught our turkey,
(Bryan sighs)
and we are cookin' him up right now.
- Check this out you guys.
Ooh, he is lookin' good!
(gobbling)
Oh, was that a gobble?
- Gobble, gobble, gobble.
(laughing)
- Are you hungry for turkey, Finn?
- No.
- Yeah.
Finn is teething hard core you guys.
Poor little guy is so sad
and his teeth are hurting him
so much, he's been in his
mouth, he's had a runny nose,
and it's kind of ironic that
his teeth are hurting him
on Thanksgiving.
This is the day you need your teeth dude.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, 'cause we're gonna eat
lots of food.
By the way, babe, I love your apron.
- Thank you.
- It's like a little Mrs. Claus apron?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you're so cute.
(upbeat instrumental music)
Alright, what are we doin' here babe?
- We're playin' the No Thumbs Challenge!
-  Oh, so Bailey's
got her thumbs down,
and what does she have to do next?
- We have to make the best ice cream cone.
- Oh cool.
Out of the--
- Out of clay, yeah.
-  Alright, you guys, one minute.
- Ready?
Go!
-  No thumbs or no big toes?
What would you do babe?
- You mean any?
If you don't have big toes,
you can't walk very well.
- Yeah (laughs).
- So I think
it'd be no thumbs.
- You're already clumsy.
- I think I would do--
- What about you, CJ?
- No thumbs or no big toes?
- Um,
no thumbs.
- You'd rather have no thumbs?
(laughs)
(upbeat instrumental music)
- Down, thumbs down!
- Okay, um,
- Missy, that's actually
super impressive
ice cream cone.
- It's a cherry flavored
ice cream cone.
- They got it done quick.
- Yeah, they did, huh?
-  Show us your
ice cream cone Bailey.
-  Let's see yours Bailey.
Whoa!
- Wow!
- What flavor is that?
- Strawberry.
-  Strawberry.
(laughing)
Jessie's swingin' the boys.
Are you okay?
(squeals happily)
Whoa!
(laughing)
They're both dizzy now.
Wow, that is a good
lookin' turkey right there.
That looks perfect.
Suzanne always makes the best turkey.
- Luck.
- It's the luck of the Mimi.
(laughs)
- She always does it perfect.
(upbeat instrumental music)
-  Alright,
everyone's standin' around
and we are carvin' the
turkey now, well, not me.
- I love how there's this
paper towel, just like,
shoved everywhere.
(laughing)
- Gotta be moist.
- Yeah, he cut
this giant breast off.
This is the other breast he's cuttin' it
into slices now.
- I never cut it like this.
- [Missy} It looks so good.
- It looks so good.
-  I did try a little
piece of it and it is amazing.
You're gonna die.
- Yeah, it's always
incredible.
- I mean, mom always wins.
Because she's just like,
even though she kind of
took it out too soon,
- I took it out way too soon.
-  In the end
it's gonna be perfect,
and look what I did.
(laughing)
I made 'em black.
- Look at this breast.
This is one side.
- I know!
Yeah, this is just the other side of it.
- Wow.
The kids are all gettin'
situated at their kids' table.
- Hey don't call me a kid anymore.
-  Oh, we already got one, okay.
Ollie, you helpin' Finn?
Are you excited to eat
Thanksgiving dinner?
- The buds are still cooking!
- Oh geez!
(laughing)
The buds are still in the oven!
-  You probably should
have set that on timer--
- She says we're good, okay.
We're starting to sit down and eat dinner.
Luna's like, "You guys are crazy.
"Y'all need to calm down, it's just food."
(upbeat instrumental music)
Hey babe, I have created a
Thanksgiving volcano palette.
This is the technique,
ladies and gentlemen.
You start with the mashed
potatoes in the middle,
and you just work in a circle,
and then you pour your gravy,
and it's just like...
- It's pretty good.
- center of awesomeness.
Finn, are you eatin'?
- Yeah.
- Is it yummy?
- Yes.
- Yay.
(upbeat instrumental music)
- You guys, Thanksgiving is over.
It is such a mess in here.
Finn's plate is still there (laughing),
and I'm in my onesie because
it is definitely getting late.
It is such a mess, like my whole house
is just like (groans).
Crazy house, huh?
- Yeah.
- But anyways, everyone's basically left.
Just got a few people left over.
Karma's still here, huh?
Did you have a good Thanksgiving?
Did you have a good Thanksgiving, Luna?
We're gonna go ahead
and end today's video.
We had such an awesome day,
I'm so thankful for my family.
I just love my family so much,
and you and your brother,
and I'm so thankful for you.
Did you know that?
- Yeah.
- You are like
the best little boy ever.
Did you know you're the
best little boy ever?
(laughs)
I'm just so thankful for
all my family, and I'm just
so glad that we're able
to all attend together.
And it may not always be
like this, where we can
all get together and stuff.
So anyways, make sure you give this video
a big thumbs up, and let
us know in the comments
what are you thankful for this year?
- Big thumbs up.
- But big thumbs up,
you're right.
And we'll see you guys tomorrow!
Bye!
- Bye!
Boop.
- Boop.
