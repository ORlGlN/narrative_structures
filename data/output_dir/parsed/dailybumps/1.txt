-  Okay, what are we doing?
- We're gonna prank house.
(upbeat music)
♪ Let's live it ♪
♪ Live it forever ♪
-  So the plan is?
- Hopefully, fill this up with balls.
-  All these balls.
- When they come to get
something out of there
it all falls down on them.
-  We're
gonna put a Nest Cam in there
to catch their reaction.
Just having a little April Fool's prank.
(upbeat music)
-  What
are we doing right now?
-  They
know that we did something
but they have no idea what it is.
-  They just not sure what.
- So they're afraid to do
anything in this house.
They are afraid to open the pantry.
I told her not to open the trash (laughs)
there's nothing in there,
she was ready to open the trash.
Now they're just literally on edge,
they have no idea what to expect.
- I think they are having
a conference right now.
-  They are strategizing.
- They are literally on,
they are on pins and needles.
And I told them earlier,
I said, "We need Jimmy,
"'cause Dad doesn't want to touch it."
(laughs) There's like something living.
(laughter)
-  I told them
that I was getting so scared
that I think that I was gonna
go, I couldn't even watch it.
All right, we shall see.
-  (shrieks)
-  Oh my god!
(laughter and yelling)
-  Oh my god.
(laughter)
-  Success?
(upbeat music)
