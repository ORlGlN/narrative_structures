We're so excited to see Karma, huh?

(Oliver gasps)
-  What, whoa!
The whole house is
decorated for Christmas?
-  Look, stockings!
-  We have our stockings up?
Ollie, who did all this?
- Ugh, maybe Fred?
-  Maybe, let's
go look at his note!
There's Fred just hanging
around like he always does.
- Okay it says
" Hi Ollie and Finn,
"I'm so excited to be back,
"and can't wait to see what kinda fun
"we get into this month.
"Christmas is just around the corner,
"and I'm excited to tell Santa
that you have been good boys.
"Love, Fred."
And it says
"PS I was a little too impatient for you
"to get into the Christmas spirit
"so I had to decorate the house for you"
-  That's so cool!
-  Yeah, but I didn't-
-  That's his little door.
- And then Fred shows up!
-  Yeah, look at this tree.
He decorated this whole tree?
- I didn't see.
-  Wow, it's so pretty!
Look at the frosted flowers babe.
-  Wow, it's so pretty.
-  That is so cool,
and look at the little owl up there!
That's so cool.
-  I wonder what
we can do with this wand.
-  Whoa!
-  Oh my gosh!
-  Did you just turn on
the Christmas tree with that?
- Yeah.
-  You can do that?
Ah, whoa!
-  It's the
magic of the magic wand!
-  You can turn on the
Christmas tree with the wand!
Fred must have brought that
from the North Pole for us, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Wow, what you
guys, this is crazy!
Our whole house is decorated!
What a cool magic wand!
Let's look around the house
and see what else he did, okay?
Ollie, look it, there's snow and frost
all over our Christmas tree this year.
-  Pretty!
- It's not real ones.
-  No, it just looks like it.
That is an amazing tree.
Check that out you guys.

playroom is all decorated
for Christmas too?
-  Yeah!

Finn, it's Christmas.
Oh look at that!
We got Woody, and Jessie.
And look at this you guys.
You guys have your own
little Christmas tree in here
you can help set up!
We got a cute little Christmas tree
that the boys can put together.
And this is an advent calendar.
And, look it, here's all your stuff
for the Christmas tree, boys.
So you can start sticking all
your stuff right on the tree,
and it'll stick.
So where do the presents go, Ollie?
No, presents go on the
bottom of the tree, silly.
Put it on the tree, Finn!
There you go!
-  Candy cane.
-  Yeah, put a candy cane on.
- Yeah.

tree in your playroom.
You wanna put the hat on?

Oh, on your head?
You silly, it goes on the tree!
- It's our tree!
-  It looks so good, boys!
Let's go explore the rest of the house!

Whoa, we got a plate especially
for cookies for Santa?
And milk?
- There's candy cane!

(Christmas music)
Look at how pretty of a job Fred did.
- This was very magical.

It looks so furry and snowy and-
-  Magical?
-  Magical.
Um, babe, I think he did our room too.

-  It's so Christmasy in here!
-  Ollie, look

Fred really went all out
decorating, you guys.
He even decorated our bed.
We've got mistletoe.
- Look how pretty this is!

Fred must know that you love Outlander,
and he made an Outlander Christmas tree.
-  Look at that
sword, look at that sword!

-  There's a sword in there?
And the plaid ribbon,
the feathers, the leather, the pictures.
Look at these ornaments, babe.
This is so Claire and Jaime.
(Scottish music)
That is so awesome.
If you guys didn't know,
Missy and I love Outlander.
It's a show that's on right now,
and it's about time travel and love,
and it's one of Missy's favorite things.
- So romantic.
-  Fred, you outdid yourself.
I can't believe he decorated
this Christmas tree,
it looks so cool.
- He definitely made
Christmas magical in our room.
-  And look, even our bed.
Okay boys, you wanna go see your rooms?

Finn, you have your own Christmas tree
with all your own woodland critters on it.
That is so cool!
And a little Santa.
Whoa!
Finn do you like your room?
- Yeah!
-  Hey, Ollie,

something in your room?
- Yeah.

Come look!
(Oliver gasps)

You've got Jack Skellington and Belle.
Look at all the fun characters.
-  This is so cute!
-  I love the elf.
Look it, Ollie.
There's little elf legs
sticking out of your tree.
- Look at this.
-  Whoa, is that Woody?
-  Woody and Batman!
-  And who else do you see?
Ollie, do you see this one, Jack?
- My favorite!
-  I know, and look it,
you have all your new Christmas books out!
That's so neat!
We can start reading
Christmas books at night.
- Look over here, it's so pretty!
-  Oh wow, I didn't even see this.
This is so cool.
-  Wait, I want that!
-  Cinnamon sticks, smell it.
-  Can you smell it?
This is so cute.
Wow, Fred.
So if you guys didn't
see last years video,
our house got magically decorated as well.
I'll have it linked in the
icard so you can check it out.
This was a huge surprise.
Ollie, do you wanna say thank you to Fred?
- Thank you, Fred!
-  That's right, thank you Fred.
Oh we should go see your chicken coop!
- Yes!
-  I saw there was stuff on it.
Let's go check out the chicken coop, boys.
- Alright, I'm so excited
to see my chicken coop!
I always wanted to decorate
it like super cute,
and look at it.
It looks like Santa's workshop!
Wow, oh my gosh, it's so pretty!
The North Pole.
-  That's cool.
(Christmas music)
-  And little flowers.
Are they real?
They're real!
- You have poinsettias in here!
Are they planted in here?
-  Yeah!
- Fred planted poinsettias,
that is so cool.
-  Papa?
-  Did you just call Santa "Papa"?
-  Say "Hi Santa!"
-  Hi Santa!
- Ho, ho, ho.
You better be good this year boys.
I'll be watching you,
I'll be watching you.
-  Ew, he's scared.
- Happy Christmas chickens!
-  That's right,
happy Christmas ladies!
- How ya'll doing?
-  You got your coop all set up.
Do you have any Christmas presents for us?
In the form of eggs?
- I got one.
-  We got an egg?
- Yeah.
-  I love these
poinsettias in here.
That's so cool.
- I know, it's so pretty.
(Christmas music)
- Boys, look at what I just saw.
-  What?
- I just saw that we have a Santa mailbox.
Do you know what that means?
- What?
-  We can put letters in here,
and then I bet Fred will take
them to Santa every night.
So we can write Santa letters,
and tell him what we want for Christmas.
- Well I want a toy.
-  You want a toy?
- Yeah.
-  Do you know what
you want for Christmas?
- I don't remember.
- You don't remember?
Well we're gonna figure out
what they want for Christmas,
and we're gonna write letters to Santa.
Have Fred deliver them every night.
This is just such a cute little like,
just a cute little
mailbox for Santa Clause.
You just put them right in there.
The boys are super excited
because they found the
Christmas Lego houses!
- And this is really cool!
-  This is really cool.
This one has reindeer, and a sleigh,
and Santa Clause, and Mrs. Clause,
and a big house.
Choo-choo train with elves.
And this one's cool because
it's got a little house,
and a big Christmas tree.
- I mean, this one
comes with a teddy bear,
and a baby kitty cat.
-  Oh, nice.
Oh yeah, there's a teddy bear
and a kitty cat, you're right.
So I think we're gonna put these together,
and then maybe display
them in their playroom.
Wouldn't that be cool?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, let's
start working on it, okay?
- Okay.
-  Finn just came
in to show me his pajamas.
Look how cute he is.
You are dressed like elf on the shelf.
You even got the hat.
-  Yeah!
-  Oh my goodness, Ollie.
Look at you, you look so good
in your elf on the shelf jammies,
since Fred is back.
-  You gotta put your hat on.
-  Oh, you gotta have the hat on.
Finn, what are you doing?
-  Watch the tree!
-  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
He's looking at the peas in the pod.
You guys remember when Finn
was the peas in the pod
for Toy Story Halloween special?
I'll have it linked in the icard above.
That's what you wore.
That was your very
first Halloween costume.
Did you know that?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
The boys are both wearing
their elf on the shelf jammies
and they look so cute.
What do you think of your tree?
- Good, but there's a
minion on the hiding,
and he has to put the banana up.
-  No way,
I know there's lots of cool
characters on there, huh?
-  Yeah.
Fred we're dressed just like you!
-  You're dressed
just like him, ha!
Finn's pretty excited.
Hey, let's take a picture
of you guys with Fred.
Okay, picture!
(laughter)
-  These boys are just doing
a little nightly breakdancing
in their elf on the shelf jammies.
You guys, speaking of elf on the shelf,
we need to say goodnight to Fred.
-  Yeah!
-  Alright you guys,
say goodnight to Fred.
-  Goodnight Fred!
-  Now we gotta get all,

You guys made a huge
mess in this living room.
