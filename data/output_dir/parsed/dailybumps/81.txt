- Good morning, boys.
Hey, how was your Christmas yesterday?
-  Good.
- So, good?
Are you wearing the hat I gave you?
I love that hat on you, dude.
That's a cool Star Wars hat, huh?
It's actually made out of leather.
Good morning, Finn!
So, guess what.
I am so proud of both of you.
You both slept in your bed
until 7:30 this morning
and did not get up last night.
High five.
High fives all around
to everyone involved.
You guys did so good.
They are now sleeping
in the same bed, huh?
- Yeah.
- You guys like
sleeping in the same bed
together in your new room?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
So, the day after Christmas
is always going to be
a day of organization, cleaning up,
and playing with new toys.
We're basically trying to do that today.
Some years it can be a little bit harder,
some years it can be a little bit easier,
but I think, this year, the
boys are very preoccupied
by all their super-cool toys.
Hey, Finn, let's show
them your tool bench.
You set it all up, huh?
Whoa!
This is so cool!
So, now Finn has all the
tools, just like Papa.
He's got a saw and a
hammer, screwdriver, wrench.
That's so neat, Finn.
- Yeah!
-  You have a
brace here you can use.
This is so neat!
(upbeat music)
- So, like Bryan said, we're
doing a ton of cleaning today
and I'm going through
a lot of our presents
and, as you can see
here, I've got a present
that my mom and dad got me
and it's basically like
a little selfie taker
and it has a ball, but
it's selfie for dogs,
so I'm gonna show you guys how it works.
Let's see.
Ready?
And, ball!
He's actually doing it.
He's like, okay, now give me the ball.
No!
Oh, wow, he actually got the ball.
I didn't know you could
take the ball off of it.
He's like, okay, I did my picture,
now I get the ball, right?
Well, at least it comes off
and he doesn't just go
running with my phone.
We are now testing out
the new Star Wars drone
that Bryan got yesterday from Santa
and it is pretty cool.
We're gonna try and fly it out of here.
It's so funny because the
controller talks the whole time.
- Yeah, it has sound effects and stuff.
-  Which, I think it puts you more
in the Star Wars mode.
All right, let's see it take off.
(upbeat music)
There it goes.
(upbeat music)
(Missy screaming)
- It's pretty cool.
-  Yeah, it's fun.
-  It's definitely
easier doing it outside
than it is inside.
-  Yeah.
That actually looks really cool.
(Missy screaming)
Oh, my gosh.
That's so cool.
-  It does flips and stuff
and you can also shoot.
(drone making laser shooting noises)
-  Oh, my gosh.
-  Let's see how fast it goes.
(Missy screaming)
-  Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.
- And, it just crashed.
-  It went fast.
- Yeah, I need to turn that down.
- So, this is an indoor one?
- It's an indoor-outdoor one, yeah.
- Yeah, I feel like this is more outdoor.
Let's see it take off.
(Missy screaming)
Okay, let's go.
(upbeat music)
(Missy laughing)
Uh oh.
- I just crashed it in that tree.
-  It's in a tree now.
Karma, you're gonna have to go get it.
- Isn't this what day two
of Christmas is all about?
-  Yeah, playing with
your toys and breaking them.
(Missy laughing)
He's gotta climb it to get it.
Oh, god!
(Missy laughing)
You got it, you got it.
- Slippers.
-  Oh, my gosh.
There you go.
- There she is.
- Saved it.
- A little banged up, but--
- It's all good.
My dad is down there right
now because he is setting up
the zip line that Santa got
the boys and I am so excited.
I hope it's done soon.
It looks really fun.
It's really, really long, too.
Bryan is flying the drone
down to my dad, down the hill.
Karma is legit going to eat that thing.
Look at what my dad's doing!
- You want to try it, don't you?
-  I know, I wanna try it,
but we probably can't, huh?
- I don't know.
I mean, that's a sturdy tree.
That's a pretty sturdy tree.
- Yeah, my dad is
setting up this zip line.
- I know it will work for the kids.
- Yeah, I'm sure we'll
just do it for the kids.
It looks so fun.
I think if I got on this it
would literally just sink.
-  I don't know.
I can tighten it more.
-  Yeah?
- Just tighten this.
- Oh, really.
- It depends on what the trees can take.
- All right, the boys are so
excited to try the zip line
that they got for Christmas.
We got it all set up.
Remember when you did
this, Ollie, in Florida?
- Yeah.
-  And, what did you zip line over?
- The pool!
-  Yeah, remember the alligators?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that was so fun.
- I did it so cool.
- You did do it so cool.
This one is not as crazy as that one.
This one is kind of more
like a swing in our backyard,
so it's a little more tamer,
but it should still be fun
and it's cool that it's
out here in the backyard.
Check out this set up we got.
We even have a little hay
bale here to help him get up.
- You ready, dude?
- Yeah.
-  Thank you papa for setting up
our backyard zip line.
This is so cool.
Do you wanna try it, Ollie?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, so here are the rules.
You can only do this with
parents present, okay?
We have to be here with you.
You have to hang on to
those handles and not let go
and you have to stay
still on the seat, okay?
- Okay.
-  Nice!
(upbeat music)
Grab him, babe.
That was awesome!
That was perfect!
What did you think, Ollie?
- Good.
- That went so good.
He was not high off the ground at all.
He didn't go super fast,
so it wasn't too crazy,
and then they can just drag it up.
Is there anybody that wants to go?
- Me!
- Me!
- Who wants to go next?
- Me!
- Me!
- You already went, so who else?
Who wants to go next?
- Me!
- Okay.
- All right, hang on tight!
Reach up!
You ready, Finn?
(upbeat music)
Look at you go, dude!
(upbeat music)
Nice!
See, that's kinda cool 'cuz
you can even hold on to it,
so it doesn't get too crazy fast either,
'cuz Finn's light, so he could be flying.
(upbeat music)
Look at Finn.
He's like, my turn!
I need it!
(Bryan laughing)
(upbeat music)
Woo!
Jim, that could not be more perfect.
(upbeat music)
The boys are having such a blast.
I will say, if this is something you kids
want to do at home, definitely
have a parent present,
make sure you're following
all the proper safety precautions.
Finn, is this your favorite thing ever?
- Yes.
- Okay.
Go!
Woo!
- Yay!
-  Was that fun, Finn?
- Yeah.
(Bryan and Missy laughing)
(upbeat music)
(cheering and laughing)
-  He loves this so much.
- I know, it's so cute.
- This is like
the stuff our kids love.
Our boys just like to
get dirty and go fast.
- I had a zip line when I was little.
- Yeah?
- One my dad rigged up
and I think I burned
my hands a couple times
'cuz all we had was a
branch that went down
on a rope.
- Oh, geeze.
This is 2017, okay?
We're doing things right.
- This is a little safer, probably.
- Hit it!
(upbeat music)
(Missy cheering)
(upbeat music)
-  Finn, you're
supposed to sit on it.
He's a zip line thief.
Take it back up.
He just likes pulling it on the cable.
- Go.
Give it to Ollie, now.
-  Go on, buddy.
(upbeat music)
- I'm taking it up so I can ride,
but I think I'm gonna hit the bottom.
The kids get pretty low.
Go.
-  Feet up.
(Bryan laughing)
- I got like five feet.
-  I think this is a kids' toy.
- Well, if dad had it really
high, it'd be fun for us,
but then it would be
too high for the kids.
- Yeah, then it's too high for the kids.
It's be six feet in the air.
-  Yeah.
-  My turn!
- All right, your turn.
-  Mommy's trying
to steal your toy.
Did you see her go, Ollie?
- Yeah.
- It was funny.
(upbeat music)
- Look, I see the moon!
-  That is right, Ollie.
That is the moon.
How crazy?
Look at the sky.
- That's where Santa Claus lives.
-  That's where Santa lives?
- Yeah.
-  I think Santa lives
at the North Pole though.
- Yeah, inside of the moon
there's the North Pole.
- That sounds like
something kids just know
and parents in the movies are like,
no, that's not a thing,
and then they cut to the next scene
and it's like North Pole on the moon.
That's so cute.
- Go, Jedi!
Go, Jedi!
-  It's taking off.
-  It's off again.
Are you watching dad?
-  Gotta put my lights on.
It's dark out here.
-  Oh, look at that.
Oh, that's so cute.
Ollie, does it look like a real spaceship?
- Yeah, but it does a really cool trick.
-  You wanna see the cool trick?
-  Yeah, trick.
-  Three, two, one.
(Missy screaming)
-  Woo!
-  Is that cool?
-  That is so cool.
-  Wanna see it again?
There it goes.
(Missy cheering)
-  It's so cool
that this makes sounds.
- I know.
(Star Wars sound effects)
I wish we had the other drones here,
so they could battle.
- I know.
- I think when you hit the
other drones, like, actually,
it falls a little bit
- Oh, wow.
- And reacts.
- That's so cool.
All right, boys, it's cold.
Get inside.
Get inside.
Hurry.
Here it comes, boys.
Are you ready?
-  Yeah.
-  It made it.
You're home.
Good trip, guys.
-  My the force be with you.
X-wing, engaged.
Ready for take off.
Timing mode, activated.
Systems check, complete.
(Star Wars music and sound effects)
(character screaming)
(Finn laughing)
(Star Wars music and sound effects)
-  Aw.
- We played all day again today.
The boys even stayed in their jammies.
We just changed their jammies
so that they had some
fresh jammies for bed.
We had a really fun day, huh?
- Yeah.
- Just playing with all our
toys and just hanging out.
We actually organized and cleaned a ton,
so that was really nice,
but now, I'm putting the boys to bed.
I gotta say that putting these boys
in a bunk bed and in the same bed together
has gone very, very smoothly
and I'm just so excited.
I feel like they're
excited to sleep together
and hang out together
and it's just been going
really, really good.
We had a couple first
somewhat rough nights
where I might have had to stay in there
a little bit longer, come in
in the middle of the night
to let them know that everything's okay,
but the past few nights have been so nice.
It is now bedtime.
We're going to climb into your
comfy, little cabin up there.
Let me know, when do you guys stop reading
the Christmas books
because I still kinda want
to read Christmas books just at least
for a little bit longer,
but I know we gotta put
them away at some point
because we can't be reading
Christmas books all year round
otherwise it probably won't be as special
around Christmas time.
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.
We had a blast.
Make sure you give it a big
thumbs up if you enjoyed it
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.
What do you say?
- Bye!
- Bye!
Boo bah!
(upbeat music)
