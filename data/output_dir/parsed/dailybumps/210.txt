trying to get everything back in order
since just getting home from Oregon in
our little trip so Brian's getting some
work done and I'm letting my chickens
run around the yard right now I would
say I've been probably cooped up most of
the time that I am going my brother
doesn't really let the chickens out when
I'm home or when I'm not home cuz it's
kind of like you have to keep an eye on
them it's a little more work so all the
little chicks are always hanging out
together it's pretty cute there's
definitely like a drift in the chickens
like they hang out together and then the
older chicks hang out together good
morning guys it feels so good to finally
be home where it's comfy and familiar
and it's just it's home why do we ever
leave oh no Finn you got a splinter I

actually amazing huh
good job buddy hey it was hard to color
in those lines so now that ollie is back
from school I have a little surprise for
him you guys I picked up this thing
called an airport never heard of it
before in my life but oh my gosh I wish
we had this as a kid let me know if you
guys any of you guys did this did you
make forts out of sheets and fans so I
got this airport it's a little bit more
modern it makes a little bit more easier
so I'm gonna set this up for Ollie and
surprise him with it so we have
something fun to play in it's kind of
like a cool color - it's like a black
and gray
manual don't be a manual you need manual
come on it's just like a big like
blanket a sheet thing and now we're
gonna hook it up to the fan and see if
we can make it look like a fort okay so
I actually didn't need the instructions
you guys I opened up the instructions
and it actually had like four little
velcro pieces so these are on the fan
like so and then that's what these
strapped to so that can stay strapped on
the actual fan so now that that's done
let's hook it up and see if it works
oh my gosh this is so cool you guys look
at the window so we can look in there
and see and it's still going look at
that oh my gosh
all he is going to die you guys that is
so cool
I just created an airport in Ali's
bedroom and now he gets to play in it
hey I guess what I have a surprise for
you do you want to see what do you think
it is
what is it it's a fort dude and look at
this fan is blowing it up with air to
keep it like that
you want me to tell you we'll go in
together okay
three two what go how cool and then it
will just blow back up see how Denis is
that dude you have a cool port in your
room now yeah and look at it actually
has like this little mesh guard over the
fan which is cool it'll keep you cool
bro I know it's so cool I didn't realize
it's like taller than he is so he can
completely stand up yeah let's get lots
of cool stuff to put in it and ease off
ladies and gentlemen that is so cool you
guys check out this fort we're in I wish
I had this as a kid because I would
literally live in this thing I think
this thing cos it like 15 bucks oh you
are well hello aunty it's a fort I know
by men just looked at there you go
alright let's make a pile of weapons
that we're gonna bring to our fort okay
yeah Maui's fishhook you need that Oh
another shield we're gonna need that Oh
walkie-talkies yep gonna need those yes
you are yes we always need Buzz Light
here for the trip yep alright only I got
a trick for you you when you want to
carry a lot of stuff at one time you
just get a blankie and you put all the
stuff in the middle of the blanket grab
that corner and then grab that corner
all through the middle just like that in
that cool that should grab those
beanbags and I'll carry this okay
yeah auntie come check out the tap
getting some new furniture for our fort
huh our giant airport we should set it
up and then show it to thin so I think
he's about to wake up from his nap we
got a surprise man that might be the
best way ever to wake up huh oh he
missed you all he's so excited to show
him the fort no look at that dude do you
wanna go in there he's like what is
going on get in get in get in hang on
it's flowing back up there it goes I
thought it'd what do you think getting
new fort dude pretty neat huh all right

antes under attack then I don't think
you're a mask fist bro you're Jedi so
he's a Jedi with an Iron Man helmet a
Dragon shield and a pirate sword
that's what Ollie would be then
just some casual stories today
Karma's trying to go in the port come on

the park great success kids love it
we let the chickens out this morning to
hang out they're so happy
go say hi you guys think they have been
roaming around all day and all the
chicks like to stick together I think
we're gonna try and put them all away
this is always interesting exactly it is
so hard the big ones go in like right
away but the babies are like no I'm not
doing that
you got all the chickens in except two
so I have Ashley here and she never
really lets us hold her so I'm actually
glad that we were able to catch her
because she does have a little bit of an
owie on her back from actually Meredith
who kind of beat her up she's kind of
the lowest on the pecking order I
believe and so I wanted to clean it up
so I was able to clean up her little
alley and get like some antibiotic and
all that on it so I'm glad I was able to
catch her so I don't really get to do
that very often she's happy right now
she's like actually been like nuzzling
me I felt like she was like kissing me
like she was like nothing my my arm
which was kind of cute hi I'm sorry you
get beat up on it's not fair huh all
right everyone is gathered around now I
made a blackberry cobbler with all the
caught with all the blackberries I had
