sleep and stuff so I think he's feeling
a little bit better he wants some sleep
I thought I'd show you my super super
clean bathroom oh it hang on and I gotta
clean it up probably I don't know if you
guys noticed but this area for me has
always been like a disaster because I
just have like a lot of like products
and things and and so this is just
always a mess and so I got a little
basket and I put all my little things in
it and it's so much more organized I'm
happy with it it just looks more like

you guys yeah is that right are they
supposed to pull himself up before they
crawl I've no idea I haven't really
looked into like what he should be doing
