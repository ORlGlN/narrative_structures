-  What do you think of that one?
This one really likes licking.
Finn keeps teasing him.
Look at that tongue.
I've never seen a horse lick.
That is so funny.
Oh, my gosh.

Are you guys cleaning up the kitchen?
- Yeah.
- Thanks, dude.
- You're helping daddy?
-  No used crying over
spilled rice, I guess, huh?
-  Good job, bud.
That was good helping.
- I spilled this
whole thing of rice on the floor.
- Aw.
Good morning, guys.
We are having a cleaning fun day.
We are actually taking
down the Christmas tree.
I've got all the ornaments here,
I've got all the bulbs off,
the garland, the beads,
all the fun stuff, and
we're taking it down.
I'm actually really proud of us.
I feel like we kept the
tree pretty well fed,
so it lasted a really long time,
all the way until January first.
At this point, it is pretty dead,
but honestly, I've had more dead trees.
They're really not falling off,
so I'm pretty proud of us.
I think we did good.
It's definitely time though.
We'll leave all the other decorations up
for just a few more days,
but this tree has just gotta go.
It's just that time, right, Ollie?
Yeah.
All right, I have been
literally taking apart
this tree for hours.
It's finally gone, thanks to my dad.
He helped me finish it off.
I literally was untangling the lights
and I could not get it untangled.
The lights literally looked as though
I had tied knots around it.
Like, we're never
getting rid of this tree.
So, thanks to my dad,
finally got it out and now
I've got to sweep all this up
and get rid of those needles,
which is always the funnest part
about having a tree, huh, Karma?
I'm trying to really
pack it all into here.
For some reason, we have a ton of balls.
I do not know why we have so many balls,
so I'm going to donate these
because I just don't need them.
I don't need that many balls
and there's all different sizes and colors
and I kept what I need.
I don't need any more than that.
Me and my parents decided
to go on a little adventure
and we are back at the boarding facility
that I'll be boarding my
horse once I actually get one
and I just want to show them
and kinda look around again.
I just feel like this could be the place
I'm going to hang out a lot,
so I wanna really get to know it.
I'm taking Finn to come see it, too.
Oh, my gosh.
This is Wally.
Hi, Wally.
Finn, do you see Wally?
-  Look at Wally.
-  Can you sit?
-  Wally is like a dog.
He can sit.
He's trying.
How about you just give me it?
What do you think of that, Finn?
Is he cute?
My mom's feeding the pig.
Mom, do I need to get a pig?
-  I don't know.
You wanna feed him?
-  It's nice we can come here.
Oh, gosh, he's so nervous.
Some pig, hey?
- Did you give him a kiss?
- Look, he likes Cheerios.
- Can you pet him?
Can you pet Wally?
Aw.
Check out this guy.
How are you?
You're very camera friendly.
(Missy laughing)
He's like, where's my Cheerios?
Look at him.
He's like, come here.
Give me some love.
Finn, say hi to the horsey.
- Hi.
-  Can you pet his nose right here?
(Missy laughing)
What do you think of that?
- Hug?
- You can give him a hug.
Aw.
(light upbeat music)
He likes peppermints?
That's so sweet.
- He likes everything.
- He's gonna have good breath.
-  He used
to drink beer with my dad.
- Really?
(Missy laughing)
- Check out this view.
It's so pretty.
I just love this property.
Finn, what do you think of all this?
Is that pretty cool?
You like the horses?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
You wanna go say hi to the horses.
- Yep.
- Yeah?
Aw, are you my little horse guy?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
What do you think of that one?
This one really likes licking.
Finn keeps teasing him.
Hi.
Look at this.
He's so cute.
What was his name again?
- Cosmo.
- Cosmo.
Oh, there you are.
Oh, he likes peppermints, too?
- Oh, yes.
Yes.
- Hi.
Look at that tongue.
I've never seen a horse lick.
Is that a good peppermint?
That is so cute.
Oh, my gosh.
-  All right, go ahead.
-  Give her a lick.
-  Oh, there you go.
-  It's literally a puppy dog.
- It's like getting licked by a giant dog.
- Ollie and I just got
back from the movies.
We had a little guys' day
going to see Star Wars, huh, Ollie?
- Good job.
You get to feed the hamburger to him.
-  You're playing Pop the Pig?
- Yeah, and then you push it
down one time so it clicks.
Good job.
All right, Finny's turn.
- Actually, Ollie and I both
went to see the new Star Wars,
the Last Jedi for the
second time for both of us.
He sat through the whole
thing again, he loved it,
we ate so much popcorn, it was delicious,
so it's kinda like a great
way to start the New Year.
- Three.
-  And now, they're
playing some Pop the Pig.
- I'm gonna pick red.
-  What does it say?
- Two.
- Two.
-  Good job.
Put it in and then you gotta
push down two times.
Good job.
- Good job.
-  All right, Finn's turn.
-  That's how he rolls dice.
That's amazing.
- All right, a red one.
You need to do a red one.
Can you do that one?
- Yep!
-  Red.
- Do the red.
One of these.
Good one.
Now, what does it say?
Ollie, what does it say on the bottom?
- Three.
-  Three!
Good job.
All right, Finn, you have to feed him.
- Yep.
- Okay, you get to push it three times.
One, two, three.
- Three!
- Good job.
(upbeat country music)
- Oh, he did it!
-  What happened, Ollie?
-  No, he exploded.
He ate too much!
- He popped.
He ate too much and he popped.
-  All right,
we gotta empty him out.
Ready?
- Oh, boys!
Time for dinner.
I have combined two of
your favorite foods,
grilled cheese sandwiches and waffles!
Does that sound good, Finn?
- Yeah.
-  Ollie, does that sound good?
- Not really.
-  Ollie's a little unsure.
- I would be too, but you have to try it.
-  Okay, wait, I want to show this.
We had waffles this morning
and we had a couple left over
and I was like, well, maybe
I'll do something with them,
so I saved them.
- They smell good.
- It smells so good.
Actually, just give me that one.
I wanna take a bite.
I have to test it before we
give it to the kids, right?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Is it good?
- Mmm.
I think they'll love it.
- Here.
Finn, you wanna try, bud?
Let's go sit down for dinner.
(upbeat music)
All right, kids are in bed
and we are just chilling for the night.
I had such a fun day hanging
out at the boarding place.
It was so cool to just get
to know the other horses
and people around.
It was just a really cool time.
Plus, today was the first day of 2018.
- Yes, we made it one day.
- One day.
- Ollie's already asking
when Christmas is.
- Yeah, he's like, so, now
that Christmas is over,
when's Christmas again?
I hope you guys had a
good first day of 2018.
We have some fun stuff planned this year.
I'm actually excited to travel more.
Not necessarily more than we did,
but just continuing to travel.
2018's gonna be really cool,
but anyways, I hope you
guys enjoyed today's video.
We're going to be, huh Karma Chameleon?
You gonna go nigh nighs?
All right, give this
video a big thumbs up.
- Thumbs up.
- And we'll
see you guys tomorrow.
You guys wanna say goodbye?
- Bye.
- Say bye.
Boop.
(upbeat music)
