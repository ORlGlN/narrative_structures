- Good morning, guys.
So, I've actually been
working on something
for a couple of days now.
And I'm gonna show you guys.
And I'm also gonna show the boys
for the first time and
see what they think.

(boys squeal)
- Good morning (laughs)!
I got them to sit here
for like one second,
so I could say good morning.
Good morning, guys, they're up.
Oh yes, they found this little gift
that I think Ollie got for his birthday.
And we hadn't seen it in forever.
We were cleaning out some closets.
And they're so excited that they found it.
That they were able to find these.
(gasps) How cool.
Finn, what's on your face?
What's on your face?
-  A chocolate.
- Oh, yeah, it's actually Nutella.
I've never had Nutella,
but I know Bryan likes it.
And so, I thought I'd buy some.
And I gave some to Finn and he loves it.
Do you love it?
You like it?
Oh, you don't, really?
I thought Ollie would like it.
But Finn likes it.
He's like, I'm gonna eat these sticks.
Good job.
But yeah, we're just
getting ready for the day.
We're gonna do something crazy today, huh?
- Ah.
- Ah.
All right, boys are dressed.
And of course, matching.
Even laying the same.
Both even have bed heads still.
Your hair's sticking straight up, Ollie.
But you guys look so cute!
And now, they're so excited for Legos.
Are you guys excited?
-  Yeah.
- Show me your happy dance.
Happy dance, happy dance, happy dance.
Finn, what's your happy dance?
Show me.
Yay (chuckles).
All right, oh, my goodness.
Love doing Legos with kids.
It's always really fun
and not stressful at all.
So, just opened this up,
and apparently the
instructions were not in it.
(laughs) Or I'm sure it was,
and they accidentally lost it.
I'm so bummed because he was really
looking forward to having the green one.
And Finn wanted the white one.
Now, the white one has the instructions,
but this one doesn't.
How am I supposed to put it together?
I mean, I guess I could look at this
and like try and follow along.
I think what I'll do is I'll
try and look it up online.
Maybe there's an online
version of the instructions.
Let's find out.
(upbeat music)
- Good morning, guys.
So, I've actually been
working on something
for a couple of days now.
And I'm gonna show you guys.
And I'm also gonna show the boys
for the first time and
see what they think.
So, as some of you who have
been watching our channel for awhile now,
you know that in December strange things
happen around this house.
We get some weird visitors.
Last year we had the
Grinch come to our house
and completely destroy everything.
(Christmas music)
(blows nose)
We have also had Elf on
the Shelf come to life
and play pranks in our living
room on our Christmas tree.
(gentle music)
And we also have video evidence
of the proof of Santa.
As, one year, we caught him
on our security footage
dancing around our house.
(upbeat Christmas music)
So, I was thinking,
around Thanksgiving time,
I was like, "You know what?
"We probably should be a
little more proactive this year
"with the creatures we are letting
"into our house this Christmas.
"Because who know what they can do?
"They could really mess things up."
And we don't want that to happen.
So, I have created something
that I think the boys are going to love.
And I'm gonna show you guys.
(upbeat music)
Check this out, you guys.
This is what we are going to use
to capture creatures in this month.
It doesn't look too nice now.
It's kind of just black bars and boring.
So, I'm gonna show it off to the boys
and have them help me
make it all Christmas-y.
I think this is gonna be
super fun for the boys.
And it actually might end up being
a really cool family tradition (laughs).
Come here, kiddos.
Hey, boys, what are you up to today?
(Finn babbles)
- We got Legos!
-  Oh, cool (chuckles).
Hey, do you guys wanna
do something really fun?
- Yeah!
- Daddy has a surprise for you.
Okay, so, Ollie, you know how last year,
we had the Grinch in our house,
messing things up?
- Yeah.
- And then, we also, one year,
had Elf on the Shelf come to life
and toilet paper our Christmas tree?
And then, also one year,
we actually saw Santa Claus
on the security footage
dancing around our house?
Well, I was thinking.
Finn, this goes for you too.
I was thinking, Finn, what if
we created some kind of device
that we can capture those creatures,
and then, do really fun things with them?
Does that sound fun?
- Yeah.
- Should we set up a trap?
Do you guys wanna see what I made?
I need your help, can you help me?
Finn, can you help me?
You wanna help decorate it?
- Yeah.
- All right, let's show 'em.
All right, boys, come on and check it out.
Come on, come on, come on.
- Whoa, look it, that is awesome!
-  I know,
do you think it'll work?
- Yeah
-  Do you think
we can actually trap
some cool creatures in this?
- Yeah.
- Well, right now, it's not
really Christmas-y enough,
so you guys gotta help
me decorate it, okay?
-  Okay.
- All right, let's get some stuff.
(upbeat Christmas music)
Final piece, Ollie, is the jingle bells.
You know important the
jingle bells are, right?
- Yes.
- Yeah?
Can you sing a little?
- Yeah.
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪
♪ Jingle bells, jingle all the way ♪
- We have jingle bells.
We are now going to attach these, Ollie.
So that, when it moves or it goes down,
we'll here it and we can come running,
and see what's inside, okay?
-  Okay.
- Okay, so, I'm gonna
attach those right here.
I think we did such a
good job, by the way,
putting this all together.
It looks so cute and Christmas-y.
(upbeat Christmas music)
All right, boys,
now that we have the
jingle bells attached,
we have it completely decorated,
we have fastened it to our
pulley system here, see?
So, now, all we have to do--
Watch this.
(upbeat music)
And then, we raise it all
the way up, just like so.
Check this out.
So, I have a system right here,
where we can tie it off and it can dangle.
And then, every night, Ollie,
we'll set it and we'll
put some bait underneath,
and we'll see what we
find in the morning, okay?
Does that so cool?
- Yeah.
(upbeat Christmas music)
- We are calling this The
Great Christmas Capture.
Are you excited to see
what we capture first?
-  Yeah.
- What do you think it's gonna be?
- I think it's going to be the Grinch.
- Oh, we definitely have to get him, huh?
- Yeah.
(Bryan chuckles)
(upbeat Christmas music)
(jingle bells ring)
(upbeat Christmas music)
- I think we caught something, Ollie!
What did we catch?
- A Mama!
- We caught Mama!
What are you doing in
our Christmas Capture?
- What is this?
(Bryan laughs)
Oh, my gosh, this was crazy.
- Do you feel holly jolly?
- I mean, it definitely
is very festive in here.
-  Yeah, babe, so we are doing
The Great Christmas Capture this month.
We're gonna catch some crazy critters.
You know how we had the
Grinch in our house last year?
Like, that can't happen.
- I'm totally down to catch the Grinch.
- Yes, and maybe, Ollie, as
it gets closer to Christmas,
we can catch Santa.
All right, Ollie,
should we set Mama free?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah (chuckles).
So, what do you think, babe?
Is it okay if we just have this
hanging in our foyer,
24/7 until Christmas?
- Yeah, I'm down, that sounds great.
- Time to set Mama free.
- Let's set her free!
There you go, babe.
-  Yay!
(upbeat Christmas music)
- Okay, so I know that this
is probably really silly,
but I am really excited
about the Christmas trap.
I think that the kids are gonna
have so much fun this month.
I think what's happening here
is I just love seeing like,
that little magic
twinkle in my kids' eyes.
-  I have something
to share with you.
- Jibo, I'm vlogging, okay?
-  140 years ago today,
Thomas Edison famously recorded himself,
reciting Mary Had a Little
Lamb on an early photograph.
- Interesting, before my
robot rudely interrupted me,
(laughs) I think I was saying,
I just love see the twinkle in their eyes.
And I love doing fun
things like this with them.
I think that they're definitely
gonna get a kick out of this.
So, yeah, I know, some of
you are probably wondering,
"That is like really quirky."
Or, "That is like really weird."
Or, "No one's every done that before."
And I know, humor me, guys.
Just trying to have fun with my kids
until I get old and can't walk anymore.
That's not gonna be soon, right?
Hey, Jibo, you're weird.
-  I won't argue with that.
But you would probably
seem a little strange too,
if you were one robot living
in a world full of humans.
- Guys, it is a beautiful day today, huh?
Yesterday was really cold.
And today, it's actually really hot.
So, I'm wearing sweaters
'cause you never know
what the weather is going to be.
I mean, you do if you look at the app
on your phone that says weather.
And it could tell you
what the temperature's gonna be (laughs).
Anyways, it is such a nice day.
It feels so good.
So, we're hanging out outside,
jumping on the furniture.
Playing with the puppy dogs.
We're gonna go walk down
and see the chickens in a minute.
But first, I thought I would let the boys
open up their little advent
calendars a little bit early.
We usually do it at night.
(Finn yells)
(chuckles) He's so excited.
But me and Bryan are actually
going on a little trip,
a little getaway together.
And so, I thought I
would hang out with them,
and do the advent calender
before I leave, okay?
-  Yeah.
-  So, let's do it, okay?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
All right, we're gonna
open up this one first.
And I just noticed, you didn't
open up your 20 yesterday.
It was 20 days until Christmas yesterday.
And now, it's 19, so you
guys get to open up two.
Yay, all right, you wanna
open up the first one?
What is it, what is it?
What are you hoping for?
- I think I got the one that I wanted.
-  (gasps) Did you?
-  No.
-  It looks like
just a little spaceship.
All right, Finn's gonna open up this one.
There you go, 19.
19 days until Christmas, Ollie.
Are you ready for Christmas?
-  Yeah.
-  Here you go, bud.
Oh, another spaceship, wahoo!
(Finn babbles)
They're so cute, huh?
- Yeah.
- All right, go play.
Yay, advent calender's done (laughs).
Puppies are playing.
Gotta go check out our chickens, huh?
We're working down here to try
and get this all like leveled out.
We really wanna make this
like a cute little area.
Maybe a little garden,
maybe a place for the boys to play,
like a little play set or something.
And my chickens!
How you doing, chickens?
How's leg going?
Leg, egg laying going, I kept saying leg.
How's the legging going?
Got three eggs, yay.
I'm getting about three a
day, that's exciting, guys.
It's always been really hit
or miss with my chickens.
Which is fine because you know,
we're just eating the eggs,
and it's not like a big deal.
But three a day is pretty awesome.
Thanks, girls.
How are you doing?
Are you happy chickens?
Happy chickens 'cause you don't have
any roosters ganging up on you, huh?
All right, well, you guys look good.
You're fed, see you later.
Bye, chickens.
Yeah, every time, guys.
(laughs) I have to lose at
least one egg every single day.
I'm am not exaggerating this.
I probably lose at least
one egg every single day
that I go and collect eggs.
I don't collect them every single day.
So, if I have six eggs,
I'm gonna lose one.
I'll get them all the
way to the refrigerator,
I'll open the fridge.
And just as I open the fridge,
one will drop onto the
floor, it's so annoying.
So, now we're gonna have
scrambled eggs out here.
'Cause actually the sun
is pretty warm today.
I was actually getting pretty toasty,
so that's gonna cook up nicely.
- All right, guys, did
we have a fun day today?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I'm ending the vlog with the boys today
because we filmed a fun video today,
didn't we?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, if you guys wanna watch it,
go ahead and click the Icard.
Mommy and Daddy are on a
little getaway right now,
so I'm hanging out with the boys.
They're staying the night
with me and Mimi and Papa.
But we're gonna go end the vlog.
You guys ready?
- Yeah.
- Give this video a thumbs
up, if you guys liked it.
Thumbs up, Finn.
Yeah, leave a comment down below.
And subscribe to their channel.
Yep, and subscribe to my channel.
Yes, and I'll see you guys in my next one.
Bye, boop.
- Bye, boop!
- Bye, boop!
(upbeat theme music)
