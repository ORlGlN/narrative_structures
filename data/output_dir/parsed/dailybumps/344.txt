Oliver what is doing it's all over now
why did you do that you did really
hungry yeah all right we just got to the
doctor's me and Finn and we are going to
get a little update on him I think he's
doing great they just said they want to
see him back in a week so then about a
week almost a week and he sounds great
to me
I think that he's completely through the
clear of all of it and he's definitely
getting a lot better I feel like he's
not it hasn't even had like hard time
breathing or anything like that so we
just need to update from the doctor see
how things are going
hey buddy you hate being in the car huh
get me out here mama you know you're
still wearing your jammies I want didn't
get you just today
but it is a little chilly so at least
you won't be like hot one ally Logan
well in a shocking turn of events I
decided to not go to this appointment I
waited about an hour there was like 20
kids waiting before Olly are you for
Finn and they were all like sick kids
I'm like waiting in the sick room and
I'm just thinking this is cannot be good
person waiting in this big room when he
does that over his sickness so I guess
that it hasn't even been a week yet and
she said you want to see in a week after
one of his appointments so I'm just
going to reschedule maybe at a time it
is not so busy but it's not like a
bazillion sick kids around us so I'm
gonna head home now all right Missy is
back from the doctor's which got moved
round and my stuff come in Finn is
taking a nap now and missing I just got
off of a meeting and kind of have some
bad news and I'm pretty bummed about it
just because we've been working on this
for a long time I can't name any names
or give any specifics but basically we
were planning a pretty huge trip we were
getting ollie ready
the whole family ready we were working
with a couple of different companies and
this morning they just pulled up and it
was kind of a bummer because we were
literally supposed to leave in a couple
hours and the reason that they pulled
out was very minut but rubber reason
they did just kind of bummed when you've
been planning something for so long and
then it gets canceled and we're trying
to figure out if we can make it work on
our own and I don't know it's gonna work
out I'm just really kind of bummed and
I'm especially just bummed for the kids
because we don't really tell the kids
things too far in advance because then
they'd ask about us ask about every day
and we just finally started gearing
Ollie up for it like yesterday and now
it's not happening so I do feel bad for
Ollie because he was looking forward to
it and now it's not happen also I just
learned is International Day of
happiness so trying to be happy through
the midst of all this bad news and
seeing what we can do I'm kind of in a
rut right now we need to figure it out
for sure hey Olli what do you guys build
in oh really who do you have pain bad
guy
oh is that penguin let me see oh yeah
that's the penguin bad guy huh yeah we
picked up a little Lego set to do with
Olli because he's been so excited about
it yeah we've been pretty busy so what
is this going to be it's going to be a
car Olli that's cool
Oh for Batman cool yesterday we picked
up an easy lunch to throw into the oven
it happens on that way Oh smells so good
normally needs us for dinner so the fact
that we're having it for lunch is
definitely making it an international
day hasn't it also got some garlic bread
I've burned the last batch so I'm trying
not to burn this one how's that look
looks good all right that's okay what'd
you find Olli fret pan are you afraid I
think she's afraid yes that's a spider
do you want me to get a jar and we can
put it on top and look at it put the
turn on top of it and it'll trap it oh
he's moving so freaking did you get it
oh no he's on the side get it I got him
he's in there now can we have some
smashing you have to smash him Wow what
if you learn to do that Olli it's okay

that because cuz why why a nice Wow

firing flock horses woke up from his nap
he is so bad come on no bugs not going
on r7s my mommy said I really have to
camp out everything and you want to get
ready for this and it's kind of a bummer
house I don't think your child for the
same thing that I'm sad about but I know
Brian kind of give you a little bit of
our update feel like the house is a
little sad right now whether it's about
the same thing and I just kind of like
we had I have like the kids pack I have
most of my stuff packed I have like all
our snacks and everything is like at
least put together whether in the
suitcases are not with some stuff is in
the suitcases I have to unpack it all
it's kind of kind of a bummer well bud
oh maybe we'll still do something fun
all right we are spending some time
outside right now it is beautiful I
guess there's a nice breeze is not
chilly I bought both thing and Ollie
some Crocs because they love playing
outside but they always just play out
here barefoot and I thought might be
nice for them to have something they can
easily slip on and off that way they
don't like scrape up their fee and stuff
so here you go ollie you're going to
your team let your feet enough they're
really easy to put on
yeah you just flip it on like that and
then slip on your other one and you got
yours
everyone needs a good pair of Crocs I
know and like I can pull them off these
kids I'm gonna see a friend yeah
big I got it going there you go
let me see em Wow good I'll help you put
the strap on the other side so they stay
on a little better
Wow you ready say let's do this beauty
okay go frolic what do you think those
are pretty handy huh yeah we let the
chickens out to do some frolicking you
looking for eggs Olly
whoa and there's a chicken they thanked
for the egg look at I don't you that's
three eggs a day only different colors
that's so cool hot different day
so we've been getting a lot of questions
about the dogs you guys haven't seen
them in a few days and I wanted to kind
of tell you guys what we're doing we
have a lot of trips going on right now
they actually went off to a little
boarding area so that they can like not
worry about the construction that's
going on we don't do worry about getting
them two incomes we have a couple trips
they're only going to gone for a short
while and they'll be back but the
coolest thing is while they're at the
boarding they also are being trained
again when you guys might be wondering
why are we training again I thought she
already did the training so the training
that we did before I honestly didn't
know that there were like multiple types
of training and honestly from a lot of
your guys's comments I had learned that
the training that we had chose probably
wasn't the perfect type of training for
especially for our very very smart dogs
so I kind of learned right away that it
wasn't really something I wanted to
continue with karma I continued with
Luna for a little bit longer but then
really it just was not the direction I
want to go and so for those of you who
don't really understand I'm saying is
that it was a correctional type of
training where you use training like
collars whether it was like a choke
collar or a pinch collar after doing a
lot of research
I honestly realized that it was not what
we want to do and we ended up she like
graduated it but we ended up stopping a
little bit earlier than if we had
continued on she would have gone for a
little bit longer and it was just
something I kind of hit like a breaking
point
once they wanted to introduce like the
shock collar or the remote collar or
whatever that's when I was like no I
can't do that this is not going any
further so anyways I went into a lot of
research about it I found a trainer that
does positive reinforcement training
which I did know the thing so I want to
say thank you guys for kind of informing
me all the boys are having a fun time
right now
so thank you guys performing me that
there are other options of training but
we stopped it before it went too far and
now they are at a positive reinforcement
boarding class where they are getting
like the full dose the guy there is just
so nice so amazing I feel like he's
taking really good care of my dogs and
he says this is definitely the best way
to train your dog if you want a
well-trained dog you can do weekly
courses but you may not get the same
effect especially with having you know
two younger kids and things like that so
I know there's a lot of like debate on
training and boarding trains but
honestly it's a very reasonable thing
that people do and it's worked out
because we had a lot of trips plans
months one of them got canceled so
another one is going to take its place
most likely so we're just using this
time while the dogs are there to be able
to not have to worry about them like do
things that we would have to do and have
to worry about them yeah like they would
be going in and out of boarding instead
they're just going to stay there do
their training and in one place and get
training same time and it will be I
think a little less stressful especially
with all this construction going on it
gets loud it gets noisy it's stressful
it's for the best it's really hard
though I miss them both so so much
better doing it together though because
they're so influenced by each other yeah
I think it's for the best I think we did
a lot of research on this this time I
think we I wish I would have done a
little bit more starting from the
beginning because if we had it we might
probably wouldn't need to send them to
boarding right now but that's the thing
about life is like if he knew all the
right answers in the beginning it Rison
yeah perfect and great and I think not
always about what the thing is is though
Luna is okay like Luna got a good
foundation and she was never abused I
don't want anyone to think to let she
was like her in any way shape or form we
just stopped it before I was because
before I like it became too
uncomfortable for our family and for her
so everything's good I miss them a lot
though but I think it's for the best
Ollie fell asleep on the couch and they
have to go he has to go question Wow hey
Finn can you wake up your brother
even
