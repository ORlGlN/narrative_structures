good morning Finn
good morning ollie oh we are getting up
and we're cleaning up on why you look so
cute look at that he's full-on and
getting himself into
yeah let's front dinos he's full-on
getting himself into crawling positions
it's so crazy look at this hear that is
that crazy or what
ah you are the craziest four and a half
almost five month old ever he's crazy
like you were ollie you want crumb cakes
you guys this is the secret to success
so I give them my secret yeah sometimes
in the early mornings if he gets up
really really early he grabs one of
these snacks and sits on the bed with us
and we all watch TV together huh yep I
guess sometimes I'm not ready to get up
at 6:00 a.m. you want to open it
these ones are crumb cakes though and
this one's really crummy so maybe we'll
go downstairs and eat this one kay you
guys not there so I know I wanted to
take my drone to Hawaii and so last
night I actually got everything situated
and I charged all of my batteries and
then I read online this morning
that if you go on to an airplane with
charged batteries they will explode so
basically now I have to deplete all of
my batteries so I put one in here and
I'm basically just gonna fly it above
our house for an hour until all the
batteries are depleted and not charged
up anymore kind of a fail on my part but
I really want to bring the drone because
I want to get some really cool shots
good morning guys we are just finishing
up our packing I'm basically all packed
I'm just
kind of finishing up some cleaning um
you know it's not fun to come home to a
dirty house we also having friends or
family actually stay here while we're
gone so I have to make sure the house is
clean and orderly so that people can
stay here you are just trying to crawl
away huh you are so so singing cute and
the weird is baby ever
oh okay so we leave in one hour to go to
the hotel and I'm still not packed I'm
working on it this is probably the
hardest trip I've ever had to pack for
and it's because we're going to two
different areas two different climates
though I'm not really sure what to pack
so this is one side of my suitcase and
it's basically full of all my clothes
and this never happens but I just wasn't
sure what I should bring so and I still
have more things to put in there now so
gotta find room for those but always
taking a nap bin he's taking a nap
right here actually so we have one hour
to basically finish packing and get
loaded up so we can be on our way there
