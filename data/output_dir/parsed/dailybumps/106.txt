- We would do something
we have never done before.
- Yes you guys we're gonna do it.
We're gonna read some mean comments.
- Why would you say something like that?
- That's so rude, that's just hurtful.
- Like I feel so bad.
♫ Shine, this is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
(upbeat music)
- Happy Sunday everybody and welcome
to the Daily Bumps vlog.
Sunday is always such a fun day
for us because it's the day
we always kind of chill.
We all went to church this morning.
Which went very good,
the boys both did great
and then we got home and the boys
are now doing quiet time for Finn
that means a nap, for Ollie that
means he gets to lay in his bed
and watch a show, read a book,
play with his toys, anything as long
as he's doing it in very little
light with very little noise.
But I have to show you guys this because
I was not going to put
Finn in his crib anymore.
I can not get him in and every time
I do he just wakes up so I literally
just sat him on the
floor next to his crib.
Because I figured he's probably
gonna sleep a whole lot better
next to his crib than inside his crib.
Plus he's two now, he's gonna wake up
and he's gonna walk out of the room
and just look for me or Missy
or someone and we're watching him.
So I know that he's okay.
But I think it's just getting close
to the time we put him into a big boy bed.
When we do that I really want Ollie
and Finn to share a room because
I feel like it would be really, really
good for them as brothers to share a room.
But that's what we're
working with right now
with his sleep transition it's been crazy
getting him to fall
asleep in his crib lately.
So he's chilling pretty good
on his floor next to his crib.
(soft music)
- Good morning bud.
(Finn mumbles)
Did you sleep on the floor?
- No.
- Yeah you did, did
you sleep on the floor?
- No.
- Yes you did, yeah I just got home.
I was actually hanging
out with my mom and dad.
And apparently he slept on the floor.
That is crazy, we have definitely
been still struggling with like
what exactly we wanna do with his
crib or big bed and stuff like that.
And it's hard because most nights,
most of the time, this is
the best option for him.
But putting him in here
can be such a pain.
'Cause you have to kinda like shove
him in and then zip it up and
then hope he stays asleep.
And sometimes he's not asleep
and he's like get me out of here.
He's like in that in between stage.
He's not quite ready for big boy bed.
But he's like super done
with the crib, huh bud.
And we just went back to watch
when we switched Ollie over although
every kid is different and I really
am not trying to like
compare where they're at.
'Cause Ollie and him are very different.
And Ollie was never the kind to
like just climb out of the crib.
He would rather just sit there
and wait for me to come get him.
But either way we switched him right
about at this exact age,
two years and one month.
He'll be two years and one
month in a few weeks so crazy.
Alright, what do you want baby?
(Finn mumbles)
Oh yeah, he's like obsessed with
clothes right now he's like always
wants to try on a different outfit.
What are you thinking, you
need something else to wear?
- No.
-  No you're comfy?
- Ollie's still sleeping, he fell
asleep watching a show so, I'm gonna
go in and get him because we
want him to sleep good tonight.
Ollie, hey buddy, iPad,
what's he watching?
Disney Junior Halloween (laughing).
Hey buddy, did you get a good little nap?
Mama wants to cuddle with you.
You wanna go cuddle with mama?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, come on kiddo,
you're so cute, you fell
asleep watching your show.
I love kids when they
wake up they're so cute.
Hey climb onto daddy
there we go, good morning.
- Good morning.
- It's not morning time (laughing).
- Did it feel good to
nap, ooh you are sweaty.
-  Yeah he is.
(laughing)
- Hi.
(soft music)
- It is five o'clock you guys
not even five o'clock, five
minutes to five o'clock.
And this is what the time change gave us.
It's seriously almost dark here you guys.
And it's not even five o'clock.
I think sometimes the time change
is like a love and hate thing.
So let me know down in the comments below,
do you love or do you hate
the time change, and why?
I definitely don't like
that it gets darker earlier.
But I might be biased
because I'm a vlogger
and we use cameras and
they need light and stuff.
Finn just walked out the back
door with a bag of cereal.
What do you have kid, Lucky Charms.
(Finn laughs and mumbles)
-  I know it's yummy huh?
- Yeah, ooh.
- I really love his new haircut you guys.
It's seriously so cute, if you haven't
seen his haircut vlog I'll
have it in the I-card.
Do you like your haircut Finn?
- Yeah (mumbles)
-  Yeah, okay.
- Egg, he's like my eggs, oh no.
-  No.
-  Too slow.
-  Too slow.
(Bryan laughing)
-  How many eggs you get?
-  Two.
-  Not bad, it's cold.
- Not bad when they're
mostly all roosters.
-  Yeah and it's cold.
- It is getting chilly.
Alright kids are eating
dinner and it has been
a pretty chill Sunday today so we thought.
- It really has.
- We would do something
we have never done before.
- Yes you guys, we're gonna do it.
We're gonna read some mean comments.
Everyone gets, every
YouTuber gets mean comments.
We got them probably day one of uploading.
- Yes.
- There are some interesting
people in the world
and you find them in
the comments of YouTube.
- In YouTube comments.
- So we have.
- I never knew these types of people
existed until I went onto YouTube.
- Yes, yes and it's kind of like
a prerequisite of being a creator.
You have to be able to
handle stuff like this.
And make a fun video like this.
- Yeah here we go, we're gonna read,
hopefully not your guys' mean comments.
But someone's mean comments.
- Yeah you guys aren't posting these
mean comments that's not you.
- No, no one's watching
these leaving mean comments.
- Okay, first one comes
from Arianna, annoying brat.
- No I'm not.
- I've been meaning to tell them
that they are annoying brats.
Karma and Luna they
just get they're crazy.
- They are so bad.
- They jump up and down
you're right, you know.
- Yeah, you're right.
- They are pretty bratty I'm sure
that's who they were talking about right.
- Oh well of course, no one else
in my family's an annoying brat.
Alright next one's from modern sword,
and they said, what the bleep type
of bleep did I just bleeping click.
(Missy laughing)
(Bryan laughing)
I don't know.
- You probably clicked on a
very good looking thumbnail.
- Yeah a really cute
thumbnail, I don't know.
- So, you're the one who clicked on it.
- Sorry, sorry we're
so good at thumbnails.
-  Finley will you stop
stealing your brother's pizza.
- No.
-  Alright Ollie I got
a mean comment for yah, I
wanna see what you think okay?
- 'Kay.
-  Tiana Johnson said,
this to be honest is not really good,
I know y'all can do better,
what do you think about that?
- Not good.
-  Not good, who's
not good, us or Tiana?
- Finn.
- Finn, you don't know
what you're talking about.
Finn has acquired pizza so he is happy
and hopefully he will
stop eating Ollie's pizza.
- Finn, Ollie's.
- Roblox gaming said, this
is corny as bleep, corny?
- Yeah.
- We don't eat a lotta corn,
do you eat a lotta corn?
- I actually do like corn so maybe.
- She's gonna make corn now you guys.
Alright here's a really
mean one from Vincent.
To me it seems that all the Brian
cares about is the views and the video
and not his family, crappy dad.
- Who's Brian.
- The Bri, no it's not
Brian, it's the Brian.
- The, the Brian.
- To me it seems that all the Brian.
I am, okay, from now on I am the Brian.
- Okay.
- Crappy dad, you wanna see a crappy dad.
I'll show you a crappy dad.
-  Do the poo-poo dance.
(fart noises)
Pappy Taz says, no one cares
about your bleeping life.
- Ouch.
- I mean, I'd say about
2.8 million people might.
- Almost three million people.
I mean it's hard to fight with numbers
but they're pretty, pretty solid.
- It's a lot, I mean even
if you cut that in half.
- No one, I mean would
you, that could, maybe,
maybe no one means three
million peoples to this person.
So maybe what he's saying, what
he's talking about is three million people
care about your bleeping life.
- Yeah that makes sense.
- Alright Rahma said, Bryan you
and Missy won because you're both fat.
- I mean I'm sorry that our body
is not how you want it to look.
- Is it okay to call people fat?
- No it is absolutely not okay.
- It's 2017 Rahma.
- No, yeah.
- A lot of people care
about what we look you guys.
Alejandro said, Bryan thinks he
is cute but he is ugly as F.
- No you're not you are handsome
and so cute and I love you.
- Thanks babe, aw thanks, thanks babe.
- Cameron says, no offense
but I hate potatoes.
- What, I'm not even sure
this is a real person.
Jalijah said, you suck you suck
name the starfish hotdog
listen ninja starfish hot dogs.
Oh, they're telling us
what to name our starfish.
- So it's hotdog.
- Name the starfish hotdog.
Listen, ninja starfish hotdog.
Hey Ollie, should we name our
starfish, ninja starfish hotdog?
- That actually is a pretty cool name.
Actually we haven't picked
a name for the starfish.
So we will take that
one into consideration.
- Yeah.
- Why would you say something like that?
- That's so rude, that's just hurtful.
- Like I feel so bad for potatoes.
- I feel bad for people
who hate potatoes like.
- Yeah.
- Tif said, Missy you are bad mom.
- I am bad mom, am I a bad mom?
- You are the goodest mom ever.
-  What?
- Goodest mom ever.
- You're the goodest mom ever.
- Okay we can just stick with
bad mom, goodest mom,
you know, that all works.
- Hey Sara I saw your comment
it said, LOLOLOLOLO cringe, cringe.
(both laughing)
- That is so cringy.
- I mean she got, she laughed.
So obviously we're entertaining.
- Yeah, and like hate, I mean hate
is a really strong word you
don't like french fries.
- Potatoes didn't do anything
wrong to you, they didn't.
- Yeah and like french fries.
- They're great.
- Yeah.
- Mashed potatoes.
- You are a terrible person.
- Tater-tots.
- Come on, hash browns.
- Twice, hash browns,
twice baked potatoes, like.
- Baked potato soup, I think it's a thing.
- Potato chips.
- Oh yeah.
- Fatmah said, stop cutting
your hair it looks ugly.
- I look ugly?
- I think they're talking about my hair.
Do I just need to grow my
hair, do this, I think Fatmah.
- Prefers you with long hair.
- Prefers me with long hair
it's cute that he cares so much.
(Missy laughing)
Honestly.
- Alright Maria says, love love love DB
but why does Missy constantly laugh
and scream in every video
even when nothing is funny
I've been a day one watcher and she
has changed a lot will still
always be a die hard fan.
Well I appreciate you being a fan.
I'm not quite sure what you mean
by laughing and screaming, screaming?
- You've changed apparently things
are funnier and also
scarier in this new Missy.
- Yeah my, the new Missy
laughs a lot more I guess.
- In every video.
- Every single one?
- Have you screamed yet in the vlog?
(Missy screaming)
Ellie said, hate the fact it's really
obvious that you're miming in the video
cute video but for me I found
the miming cringeworthy even though
I play this one constantly
brought it without
even listening to the
sample it's an amazing song.
Okay, so I'm assuming they're talking
about the Tribe music video which
you should definitely go watch
in the I-card, you're not gonna
find any miming in the video.
- Miming.
- There's no invisible boxes or ropes
or anything like that, Ellie's
probably confusing the word
miming with lip syncing.
- Lip syncing makes sense, I will say.
- Which is what you do in music videos?
- Thank you for buying the song.
- Yeah thanks for listening to the song.
- And thanks for watching.
- I think Ellie's trying to request
that we do a video where we are mimes.
So I'll add that to the list.
- Okay.
- Thanks Ellie, alright
Missy last mean comment.
Samina said, Daily Bumps you are stupid.
- Stupid?
-  Look how they spelled stupid.
- Stupid, I don't know what that means.
-  S, T, O, O, P, I, T.
- Like stoop, 'cause you
know you can sit on a stoop.
Stoop it?
-  You know what, I'm gonna
make sure my kid knows how to
spell stupid that's for sure.
(Missy laughing)
- You know who looks
stoop it, that person.
- That's all the mean comments,
don't leave any mean comments below.
'Cause that's just mean
don't be a mean person.
- Meanie.
- You should spread love and positivity
always whenever you have the chance.
Love the person next to you.
- That's what we try to do, we love
all you guys even when you're mean.
- Yeah that's, you gotta love your haters.
Haters make us famous
(Missy laughing)
- Yes, oh my god did I
just laugh for no reason.
- Your, you've been laughing and screaming
nonstop in every video I am so annoyed.
You have changed so much I will
still always be a die
hard fan of you though.
- Okay.
- No matter how.
(Missy laughing)
Hey Ollie, what do you think
about all these mean comments?
- People could be nice.
-  They could be
nicer huh, are you nice?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, even when you don't
know someone you're nice to them right?
- Yeah.
- Hey Ollie, have you
ever left a mean comment?
- No.
- No, you've never said
anything mean to someone?
No, 'cause he's a good
boy, I raised him right.
This kid is living his best life
right now look at him, nothing
but a diaper on, eating pizza and peaches.
Dancing around in the living
room, watching Disney movies.
Hey Finn, are you having a good night?
- Yeah.

- No he's just a.
-  Okay then, goodnight Finn.

iPad, he's such a trickster.
- Yeah he's trying to get me to (mumbles).
-  Ollie what, did you drop Buzz?
I'll save him, Buzz
Lightyear to the rescue.
(Finn laughing)
-  Maybe Buzz can end the vlog.
