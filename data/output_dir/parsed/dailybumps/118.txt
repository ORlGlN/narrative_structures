- We were moving along really nicely.
We had about 90 miles left.
Then, the freeway
completely stopped moving.
Just stopped.
The time just went up to like, 3 hours.
We had to find a way
to get off the freeway.
We're now 125 miles away and climbing.
We are going the opposite way.
We have to go a different way so we can
try and get back on track.
So sad.

- Morning.
Good morning guys.
What do you have Ollie?
- I have a dino tooth.
- Whoa.
It's big.
-  Alright Ollie,
what are we doing today?
- We're going on a field trip.
-  A field trip?
We're actually going on a road trip,
and it's going to be our
first family road trip,
as a family of four.
A real road trip.
Are you ready Finn?
Hello guys, yes, everything
is kind of a mess right now
because we are packing for a road trip.
We do not road trip,
if you guys don't know,
Missy does not like to road trip.
But we're not going very far,
it's about five, six hours away,
and it's gonna be the first road trip
that we've ever taken
with both of the boys.
We once did a family road trip with Ollie
when we went to go see
Ellie and Jared in Utah,
and we've never done
anything like that with Finn,
but now I feel like they're
both at the perfect age
where they're gonna be really good.
So, knock on wood.
Knock on wood, hopefully it goes well.
Finn that is my suitcase,
you cannot unpack it,
and no, we do not need
to take this cactus,
this knitted cactus.
Can you go put that back?
Ollie have you started packing?
- No.
-  We'll you need to
pack, what're you gonna bring?
- Toys.
-  You gonna bring some toys?
- Yeah.
- Well good morning guys.
That's right, I'm here getting
ready now for our road trip,
and you know, I'm pretty
good at packing now,
I've been packing for a long time,
but I am not good at road trips.
The trust is, is that my
family and I went on road trips
all the time as a kid.
We would always usually be driving from
all the way from Idaho, to California,
and that road trip is like,
I'll never do that road
trip ever ever ever again.
Don't even try and ask
me to do that Bryan.
- Okay.
- But anyways, I'm just like,
not a fan of road trips.
I feel like I get so bored,
I feel like claustrophobic,
I feel like I can't move, it's just hard.
And probably one of the worst
road trips that ever went on,
but I have to be careful
because it's also like
a very amazing time with Bryan,
but our trip to New York was torture.
Oh my goodness.
- Apparently I have forgotten
to pack a couple of things.
-  Are you guys
gonna ride in the suitcase?
- No mom.
I'm trying to get Finn to,
for, from the toys try packing.
-  You're packing those toys
but you don't want him to get them?
- Yeah.
- You guys can actually ride in the car,
you don't have to ride in the suitcase,
you know that right?
- No but our road trip to
Utah where we went to see
Ellie and Jared, it was actually
a pretty good road trip.
We did it at night, and
it went fairly well,
and so I'm like, "Okay, let's do it.
"Let's go on this road trip."
Hopefully, it'll be good.
Hopefully, Finn does okay.
He still not amazing in the car,
I think that's why we have not
braved a road trip with him yet,
but he's finally turned around,
and we've got lots of other
things to keep him busy,
so I'm hoping it's a good trip.
And make sure you guys keep watching
to find out where we're
going, it is so exciting,
and leave in the comments right now,
where you think we are going.
It's gonna be so much fun
and a lot of crazy
things are gonna happen.
-  Finn.
What is going on in here?
What are you doing?
There's soap everywhere.
He's like wiping all over his face.
You know what he's doing right?
- He just watched you wash your face.
- I just washed my face in our bathroom,
he was looking at me like this,
and then I heard water
running in the bathroom.
You just trying to be like
daddy and wash your face?
- Yeah.
- I think that's a great
thing for me to teach you.
Yes, thank you for helping
me wash my face too, okay?
- Okay.
- You are so cute, have a kiss.
I washed my face, doesn't
need to be washed again.
Alright, we have to say
goodbye to the doggies.
They're gonna be staying here with uncle.
Uncle's gonna be hanging out
at our house while we're gone,
just so that Luna gets the care she needs
since she just had her surgery.
We don't wanna be taking
trips or anything,
although it'd be so fun to
bring her where we are going
because, where we are
going is always a fun time,
isn't it Luna?
Okay, I love you, kisses.
Kisses.
Bye Karma boy.
I love you, be good, okay?
They're like, "We got this."
I'm also really excited for this road trip
because we're taking our truck,
and it actually just had this installed,
and it's basically like a cover
for the entire bed of the truck.
So it's unclipped.
So now we have all our
stuff loaded up in there,
you can just close this like so,
and then we even lock it
on the inside right here.
It's so cool.
So now all our stuff will be like,
nice and secure in the back of the truck,
and yes, we are bringing
Finn's mattress and cover
because we have the space so, why not?
And let's go.
(road trip music)
And, we are off,
and listen to that.
- Quiet.
- Just listen, it's quiet.
The boys are all set up in
the back with the DVD player
with their headphones so
that they can hear it,
and they're just like, so comfortable.
- I'm watching Scooby Doo.
-  Okay that's awesome buddy.
And Finn just kind of keeps
taking the headphones on and off
but he's still occupied.
And when he does put them
on, can you put them on Finn?
When he does put them
on, he like, loves it.
He's so happy.
How are you feeling?
- Pretty good.
-  First minute.
- I know, I'm driving
for like the first hour.
-  Yeah.
- Just to maybe kill some time,
but then I don't like driving,
so I'm just gonna drive to kill
some time and then I'm done.
(road trip music)
-  Alright, so Missy
packed a good old lunch
for the boys, which by the
way, look at his lunch box.
It used to look like this,
and now it looks like this, it's so funny.
This is Ollie's lunch box
and she packs both the boys',
peanut butter and jelly,
pringles, apples, and a drink.
And Ollie was like, "I'm hungry",
so he's eating his lunch now.
You doing good?
He's doing good.
And that one's asleep, so, great success.
(road trip music)
- Ran out of gas?
-  No, we didn't run out of gas.
We just need to get some more though.
Because if we keep driving,
we might have, huh?
Yeah.
We stopped to get gas,
we're filling up the truck.
Missy and I are swapping out,
so I'm gonna be driving
the rest of the way, okay?
- Yeah.
-  Alright, did you wanna drive?
- I don't know how to drive.
-  You don't know how to drive?
- You wanna drive?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, we'll let you drive.
- He doesn't know how to drive.
-  Probably not, huh?
Alright, we are good.
- We got snacks.
-  What're you eating?
- I'm eating a wing-pop.
-  Whoa.
You got one too?
- Yeah.
- I got wed.
-  Finn had to wed too.
-  Apparently
we needed lots of candy
for this road trip, so
we got a huge Starburst,
I've never seen these
before, that is ginormous.
And we also got some Skittles.
See, it's so big.
- Wow.
I wanna see what's inside.
- See.
-  I know you do.
Candy.
- Alright, the sun is behind us,
and we are still drving.
- Driving.
- I brought my whole setup.
I've got, really comfy
blanket and a pillow.
This is how I've always
done my road trips.
And yeah the boys--
- Not me.
-  I am as minimal as possible.
I'm like, I want my wallet and my phone.
That's all I want up here.
- I think kind of gets
driven crazy when I'm like,
"Okay I have this and
this and this", he's like,
"So many things."
- Like it's a five-hour drive.
- Yeah I know, it is a little
much, but you know what,
I didn't bring much other than this.
I'm very comfortable.
But the boys are happy right now.
Finn has like moments of freak-out,
then I just give them a
little candy and he's happy.
How much longer do we
have like, three hours?
- Couple hours.
- We're gonna get there.
They say five hours, but I
think it's like a six-hour.
(road trip music)
So it is officially dark out,
and we are almost to Vegas.
And I'm actually really excited
because I don't think Ollie has ever seen
somewhere like Vegas, like
lit up, bright lights,
hopefully not the inappropriate but,
I think he's going to be really excited.
Because we saw like one
vet when we passed through
the California and Nevada border,
and he was like, "Whoa, look at that",
so I think he's going to be
really excited actually Vegas.
The boys are still doing good.
Finn is now naked
because he spilled an entire
bottle of water on himself.
I didn't feel like going to
get a new outfit from the back,
so I was like, "Well, you just
gonna have to sit naked now."
- I think, you ready for Vegas Ollie?
- Yeah.
(road trip music)
- Look at that laser.
- What do you think of that?
- Now there's lasers,
-  and lights.
-  Do you see how Finn?
- Yeah, I saw a palm tree.
-  A palm tree?
- Yeah.
-  Look at those
big buildings Ollie.
- Wow.
Wait, is it taller than me?
-  Yeah they're taller than you.
- Well I'm big, I can't
be taller than my hands.
-  Yeah you
don't think the building
is taller than your hands?
- Yeah.
-  Those are like pretty
tall buildings to me Oliver.
- Whoa, look at that horse.
-  You see a horse.
- Yeah I saw a horse.
It was just a small-town horse.
-  Isn't this a cool town?
- Yeah.
- I saw a man on a O.
-  On the letter O?
- Yeah.
-  That was the Bellagio.
- Bellagio?
-  Yeah.
- So why's it here?
-  Bellagio is a hotel and casino.
Look, there's Caesar's Palace.
-  Caesar's Palace?
-  Yeah.
That one's a big one.
Do you see the Ferris wheel?
-  I saw it.
-  Yeah that's
the Ferris wheel ride.
So for those of you who have been
wondering where we're going,
we just passed Vegas so
we're not headed there,
although, that would
been a really fun place.
But we're getting close,
just a few more hours.
So keep your guesses coming
where you think we're going,
passing Vegas.
We have officially been in the car
for five and a half hours?
- Yeah.
- We were moving along really nicely,
we had about 90 miles
left and we were like,
"Yes, we're gonna be there
in like an hour and a half",
and then the freeway
completely stopped moving,
just stopped.
We we're at a dead stop
for like 30 minutes,
and the time just went
up to like three hours,
it was gonna be at least three hours,
and I started reading like the,
like whatever's going on on the freeway.
It's just completely shut
down because of an accident,
and we're like, "Oh crap",
and as you can tell like,
Finn's just like, "Um momma,
"when are we getting out of here?"
- I also want to go to the bathroom, okay?
- Yeah, I told him I, you
know, he can pee in this.
(crickets creaking)
Anyways, we had to find a
way to get off the freeway,
so that we can turn around.
We're now 125 miles away and climbing.
We are going the opposite way.
We have to go a different
way so that we can
try and get back on track,
and we're so bummed.
It's probably gonna be by the end of this,
at least a seven and a
half hour drive, right?
- Yeah, five-hour trip turned into a
almost eight-hour trip.
- Yeah.
So sad.
So bummed.
We're going to get through this,
we're gonna get there pretty late.
Oh wow, look at that lighting guys.
It's like it's daytime now.
Anyways, it's definitely
about, we're really really sad,
we're kind of upset.
But we're gonna get there,
we're gonna make it.
Okay Finn, we're gonna get you there.
- Okay.
- Okay.
(uplifting music)
-  Okay Ollie, where are we?
- We're at Carl and Jinger's house.
(cheering)
- We're at Carl and
Jinger's house, we made it.
- We're gonna have so much fun,
you guys have no idea what's coming.
-  I'm so excited.
- We have lots of awesome stuff planned.
-  We made it Missy.
- Yes we did, it was a--
-  It was a
journey, but we made it,
and all the boys have
been playing already.
It's unfortunately bedtime
because we just got here.
-  Exactly, how
red Finn's eyes are,
he's so tired.
-  Finn is so
stoked because he's eating
a grilled cheese and chocolate melt
with a big boy cup.
Look at you.
- Oh that's a big bite.
-  Anyway, I hope you
guys enjoyed our road trip.
I'm so happy we made it successfully.
