you've been filming all day doing work
you are wearing makeup fresh shave it's
crazy
we're in the same city at the same time
get together good morning guys we are
off to swim class are you gonna swim oh
yes last week was a little bit tougher
than the week before he was definitely
having a hard time being in there and us
all on the outside and I don't know he's
just he's not always great with other
teachers like a teacher so I told him if
he's really good and he doesn't swim
class good then he'll get a sucker okay
I'm hoping that some bribery will help
him actually participate and not cry or
want and just not do the class we'll see
oli I am so thinking proud of you you
know that yeah yeah you want a sucker
cuz you did so good he floated all by
himself a couple of times perfectly and
I don't know if my mom and dad caught it
but like he literally floated on his
back by himself no one talked to him for
10 seconds and he would roll and it was
so good I honestly was so proud he had a
little hard time getting in there
without me so I went ahead and sat on
the steps so that he like had my support
but once I was in there he was so good
I'm so I literally you're so good you
did so good and Finn actually did really
good too he went under water a couple
times they're both just killing it and
they're doing so good so we're gonna get
you a sucker cuz you were such a good
boy okay okay excuse me sir is this seat
taken
good afternoon guys I'm hanging out with
Jeffrey and we just drove to LA we have
a couple of cool things we're doing at
maker studios and there's like a panel
and a meeting with a bunch of brands and
cool stuff like that so we made the
drive out here to LA we came in about an
hour early so we're actually at the
Westfield Mall which I've been to a
couple of times they have really great
food options so I got like this sandwich
on the spread that they fresh baked
right in the oven yeah you got Oh
Hawaiian food yn bar food Segundo Missy
is hanging out with the place today they
had to swim so she couldn't come to this
there's something she was kind of
planning on coming to so she's hanging
out with the boys today and I'm getting
stuff done in LA all right Ali
Mimi picked you up a candy cuz you did
so good she couldn't find suckers but
yeah baby this will do right you can
suck on it say thanks Mimi
alright let's open it for you guys and
back of the chicken stores we are
looking at chickens were looking at
getting fence and we just bought our
coop so really really soon we're gonna
get our chickens okay
look at they're almost all gone like
remember when this thing was before all
right you guys that we are at the
swankiest office building 1d OMD is
where we're at yeah I don't think I've
ever been in an office building like
this but I got really excited when I saw
this look at this fish steak it's
ginormous and it has the coolest fish in
it you guys look at this like you know
they have an employee that just takes
care of these fish because these things
are high maintenance
that one looks familiar all they would
know from Finding Nemo or finding dory
dude I've never seen a like a puffer
fish like that in a tank so we're
actually doing like a business panel
file with some other brands with OMD and
maker and so this is where everyone is
sitting it's actually on this basketball
court which i think is crazy cool
Geoffrey I don't know can you follow
these rules wants you to keep your
language clean I don't know we're
hanging out on the be bald court before
it starts you're supposed to take your
glasses off into court court rules yep
swish
yes alright guys I'm gonna give you a
little bit of a fair warning there is a
bit of snake footage that is gonna be
shown for a few minutes we just caught a
snake my dad did not even need this
snake is a good snake though he's really
mad he's a really mad snake this type of
snake is nice because they'll catch mice
so catch Gophers they'll catch all those
things they're not like a bad snake
they're not gonna like hurt you but this
snake in particular it's a gopher snake
he's really mad so this is him and I'm
just gonna give you a little warning you
might scare you but what we're gonna do
is we are gonna take in just a little
bit off the property just because I'm
not really comfortable with him being on
my property
we're not Robbie's not killing him or
anything he's a good snake but he's mad
he's in a bad mood
so the thing about gopher stinks as well
is they make sounds like rattlesnakes
and they look kind of like rattlesnakes
so that's like their protection but he's
not a rattlesnake and actually he isn't
hands like little tiny cheeks that could
draw blood but he wouldn't like be able
to do that much damage but he is scary
I'll tell you that right now
he's trying to make a noise like a
rabbit yeah see he's a big guy it's too
big for this cage he shouldn't yeah for
sure he's not happy guy we're gonna let
you go we let you go we just don't want
you living next to me okay
you'll probably be on your property yeah
he probably will the far end of your
property yeah probably oh no all right
we are just moving them along goodbye
mr. gopher hey that's my sand relocated
them a little bit into a more secluded
area just like it will be in the main
private property there's like the island
of just you know greenery like if you
don't know if you guys can tell what
there's a line where you can see the
tracks of where he came out so you came
out of this big old greenery look at it
along you can see this single line right
here so they're gonna long so he
basically made it from that greenery up
to here my dad kind of scuffled in here
a little bit with them I think he's
probably a truly fried snake he's not
gonna like come on us or anything but I
didn't really like his attitude he was
kind of scaring me so I was like
a little bit further away from us I just
don't want to see him around piss but he
was in a bad mood today so he has to
move a little bit further away from us
