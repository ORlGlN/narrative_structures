last night was a little rough for us I
thought for sure all he was gonna sleep
all night and it was gonna be so awesome
because he hadn't barely slept last
night and it was a really really hard
night not necessarily crying he couldn't
get comfortable and he didn't like sleep
well like when he did was sleeping it
was just a constant like tossing turning
kind of thing so I don't know I'm just

cuz it's Saturday more you gotta watch
Saturday morning cartoons on Saturday
morning this is one of my favorite
cartoons is Phineas and Ferb it's just
so much fun and I think it's cool cuz
they have like jokes for kids and adults

the colors and music but the annual
problem of our generation is fun and a
good way to spend it like maybe what's
your guys's favorite cartoon let me know
in the comments it's okay if you're an
adult just to watch cartoons okay it's
actually better because if you find a
cartoon that you like and your kid likes

gonna ride around with mommy while she
does her work you're probably wondering
where's your ergo the ergo is probably
much more comfortable probably is but I
don't know where it is you find it
anywhere it's literally lost I cannot
write anywhere this is not like you know

disappears the ergo went somewhere where
that is this is not comfortable I feel
like he's gonna fall no he's okay Wow
riding that yeah I'm a kangaroo again
boom boom but I'm betting penny he gets
ready boom boom boom
so today I was going through my Twitter
and act cool again 27 tweeted that he
went to chick-fil-a and I was like oh
hell yeah it's lunchtime and I'm
hatching for a long time so as long as I
was like I'm getting you chick-fil-a
okay whether you like it or not while
you're young like it I know you he when
you go she always gets it she gets an
ocean no pickle that's what I can do
I understand the pickles on a chicken
sandwich that's just wrong
another cool thing that he did was he
paid for the car behind him
and I was like oh that's such a really
cool gesture so she cuz it's right
around Christmas time so I was like you

we just tell her Merry Christmas oh yeah
thank you
perfect thank you you too great success
I just made someone's day a little
bitter
Phoebe always says and friends how a
good deed is always a selfish good deed
because at the beginning or at the end
of every good deed you at least feel
good about yourself and not selfish but
I don't care sometimes it's good to be
selfish if that means doing a good deed
you know what I mean
Merry Christmas happy I guess I could I
should have said like Happy Holidays or
something but if they're at chick-fil-a
they'd probably celebrate Christmas am i
right I mean we Christians eat a chick
flick
that was a broad statement I'm sorry if
you're Chris if you're not Christian
indeed it's in play it's just always
good to do like good deeds like you know
especially around Christmastime because
Christmas time is hard for a lot of
people you know some people they really
can't afford a lot of presents or their
family's out of town and they can't
afford to like come together as a family
so a lot of people have to spend
Christmas alone
a lot of times if someone in your family
has died around Christmas Christmas can
be really really hard and sort of like a
reminder to that so I always try and do
good things around Christmastime but I
always try to do good things like all
year round you know what I mean so I
always feel like if I feel blessed and I
feel like I'm given the opportunity to
help someone out then I I always want to
try and do that you know even if like
something really small and stupid you
know it's lunchtime I got chicken and
waffle fries and sauce they forgot my
honey mustard but that's okay I'll
forget them
you got always like what is wrong with
you dad why is he gonna watch it
chick-fil-a I'm gonna tickle your teeth
with your beauty I went to go uijik and
agreed apparently fake ear tickles don't
count we're doing boring adult stuff
today sheet time sheet washing time how
many times has Olli peed and spit up on
these I don't know telling you guys
that's what happens when you have kids
so me and Bryan just realized we're
wearing the same shirt I'm wearing a
v-neck great and so is he you copy me no
you copied me oh wait you did get
dressed first
yeah look up I think this is a great
look for you Cassie I really do and it
used to get a perm color your hair this
weird reddish brown color and okay
curing out that's what you are I don't
know is she it's a wig with elf ears you
get either okay anyway so me and my
brother and sister
at Target right now we're going
Christmas shopping which is kind of
ridiculous because there's like a
bazillion people out there also all
staring at me because I'm talking to a
camera so that's weird I'm gonna put you
down so you know how a couple days ago
we did this handprint impression and we
actually made it's gonna make like a
little ornament I think it's all the way
dry now so I'm gonna put the ribbon on
it and of course Missy main one for
karma which I don't know if this one is
going to come out but I guess we'll hang
it anyway because she's silly looky
there
I got it all stringed up okay let's see
if I can hang it up hi
oh hang it like there and there we got
Karma's up there to some I still be
happy with that
look at that so cool pretty Christmas

presents accumulating under said tree so

filling my mom and dad's stockings
stockings we actually every year fill
them with things just like we oh sorry

won't fill my parents talking so we have
to fill it um so I'm still being staring
at you guys anyways so yeah we always

we have look like things that are still
a to put in it what if children watch
this you're ruining so many people okay
