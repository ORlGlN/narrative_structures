good morning guys actually it's 9:00
morning it's like afternoon um I'm so
sick oh my gosh I do not feel good oh I
hate vlogging when I'm like this
just cuz I don't have a whole lot of
energy and I feel like garbage yeah I'm
sick so I'm taking it easy and I'm
trying to catch up on some relaxation
because or pool guys here trying to
catch up on some relaxation because when
Ellie and Jared here we just we seem to
do a lot you know and I didn't want to
like stay back because I was sick or
whatever but Ellie and Jared actually
left this morning they got a little bit
of a later start because they wanted to
wait till Jackson was awake to leave us
we got to see them and say bye and it
was really cool just having them over
and just being with friends for like a
week I thought that was really cool we
didn't get sick of them at all
a lot of people were saying that like
company is like a dead fish after three
days it starts to stink but they were
not like that at all they were not like
a dead fish so for the record they were
pretty awesome but I think Missy's
taking a nap right now and all he's
taken a nap I hope she doesn't get sick
um because she's got surgery here in
just a couple days and I don't want her
to not be feeling well on top of having
surgery as well so Missy's actually
having a surgery to repair her uterus
she has a like a uterine septum in the
middle which is why Oliver was so
high-risk
when she was pregnant with him and
hopefully after the surgery things will
go smoothly and she can bring again
because we do we we want to grow our
family I mean that's our goal you know
like we want to have more children and
Oliver is amazing and we love him and
and we just want to experience more of
that you know I came from a small family
Missy had a big family she had two
siblings I don't know I like the dynamic
of lots of kids and stuff so I'm
rambling I know what I'm talking about
but I just don't feel good
hurts my nose is congested I'm trying to
get caught up on a lot of stuff I
actually realized that I haven't paid
our bills yet usually I pay all our
bills at the beginning of the month just
before they're all do and so today I'm
gonna have to like frantically gather
together and get that taken care of and
just little things that I haven't been
doing because we had company and I
didn't want a tooth that might now have
to do when I'm sick so also been
checking out our new look on our channel

threw this together randomly and it'll
probably change but I like the way it
looks so far I love our little cartoony

learned about it like probably along 45
