guy sleeping smiles he's get sleepy

waiting he's been so good
just keeping dreaming about muddy
boobies oh snip the cool thing about
this race actually it's to raise funds
for organizations that help with things
like bullying and schools and cyber
bullying and you know being on YouTube
and sort of in the internet realm we
kind of have experience with this
obviously we have experienced bullying
online a lot of people have I mean it's
set up to like 90% of kids in school
nowadays are bullied and I don't think
I've ever talked about it but in high
school I was very much bullied I was
called names I was a loner for the
longest time there were times when I had
maybe one or two friends at a time but
it wasn't until really like Missy came
into school we became friends and I was
able to just like distance myself from
that so if any of you guys are out there
and you know you're being bullied I
encourage you to speak up because it's
not going to get fixed if you don't
speak up and I know a lot of people are
afraid of like repercussions if they
speak up of being bullied but it's a big
thing in schools nowadays it's not
something that you have to be ashamed of
cuz it's not your fault it's the bullies
problem it's not the person being
bullied so just know that and I just
want to like build you guys up and just
know that there are people out there who
care about you and life is so much
different outside of school you really
don't have to worry about that
then insects that kids nowadays have to
worry about that um let me know in the
comments though if you guys you know
have been bullied or your bullying story
or if you ended up how you were able to
get through it and just like leave some
positivity for other people who are
coming here who may have been bullied
people need to know what they can do you
