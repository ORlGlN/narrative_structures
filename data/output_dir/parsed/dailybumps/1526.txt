dinner naturally and it literally was
like the worst trip ever okay we tried
to put Olly in a highchair with his cool
new cover and he kept like sliding out
of it and then I'm not kidding he spit
up on Missy and I both like at least
five times and at one point Missy wiped
her face with the towel that we had
previously cleaned him with and she got
spit up in her mouth I really grabbed it
and just wiped my mouth like Oh gross
this is one of those moments where it's
like oh yeah we have a five-month-old
this is why we don't do things like this
okay but then we left here and I was
like oh she's literally should we get in
the car and she's like I'm so cute I
want another wife and I'm like are you
serious after what we just after what

excited and then the kid comes and
literally like ruins their lives and
like makes the biggest messes and they
all look miserable and then she finds
out she's pregnant again and they're
like hmm and then they're like super
