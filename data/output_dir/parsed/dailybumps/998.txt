you're gonna scare the fishes
go ashore
good morning guys I am out and about
with my sis and we're just going to grab
some things I gotta take back some stuff
and run a couple errands but you know
she just graduated so she kind of made
Bank for graduation this she kind of
wants to go shopping she's already gone
shopping without me and she got this
Fedora she doesn't know what you guys
think you guys like it do I pull it off
it's cute right I like it when you guys
yeah we're just headed out and we go hot
it is like the hottest day this year I
think it supposed to reach a hundred and
two today I should not be shopping I
should be in my pool um but yeah I just
gotta get a few things done and I
Lambright her at home so hopefully then
having some fun and I can make it back
there before I melt hey guys how's it
going
ah what's up I would say good morning
but that would be a lie it is not
morning I actually spent my morning
sitting at the table watching WWE sue
the Apple Worldwide Developer Conference
hey boy you want to go out there Apple
announced all the cool new stuff it was
working on like software wise and they
announced Apple music which is actually
really cool so I just came out here to
put karma out here and I noticed the
pool just turned on automatically to
clean and the hot tub is on so the pool
is not going to get clean unless I fix
that I told Missy I would do last night
but I didn't
and we're go then fixed it via Apple
announced all the cool new software
stuff I'm really excited for Apple music
it basically is going to replace my
Spotify subscription because I do like
to stream music and you can save it for
offline view or listening which is
really cool and you can watch all the
music videos that are on iTunes I just
think it's really cool so all is
probably just about to get up from his
nap and Missy is running errands we have
some really cool fun things to film
today so we got work to do but I came
out here and I looked at this and I was
like this is setup so perfectly I
thought and I was like this is so tumblr
right now these are the Polaroids from
all of our shenanigans yesterday for
Cassie's graduation party there's a
machine terilyn all of them playing life
Missy and Ally in the pool I
instagrammed that one earlier watermelon
testing out the macro mode on the new
Polaroid I really love this picture of
Terrell in Missy and Ollie in the pool
and then some cute ones of me trying to
get Ollie to take a picture with me I
thought how cool does that look right
now that Sun is bright alright guys we
just got done with the mall and we just
left oh we go route although the walkers
nope we're done we're good and I spot
like some hand soaps and stuff I love
routes it's all like organic and natural
things but we just needed water
there's the fanciest water there and
she's trying that this water it's tough
luck one has glass and then look at mine
it kind of looks like a beer bottle but
it's a glass I'm really trying to try it
just been working on finishing the
scripts for things that we need to film
and watching WWDC and now I'm hungry so
I need lunch and it's kind of cool we
keep our freezer like packed with really
good lunches that are easy to do so I
think I'm going to make me should I
might
a little pizza could be better leave
that I holder just like I know we are
very particular about water we
definitely work that's commercialism
mmm it's good it could be colder okay
yeah so weird I feel like I've never
drink out of a glass bottle before ever
selling soda so when would I ever drink
out of a glass bottle you know I feel so
weird although we do have a ton of
leftovers from Freebirds uh-huh cuz we
had them cater Cassie's graduation party
we ordered way too much food I probably
could have done it with like half the
amount of food so I sent a bunch of
people home with leftovers and then we
have our own leftovers but I don't know
if I can eat another one okay all right
so I ended up making a couple of little
quesadillas with all those leftovers but
now I hear oli so I'm gonna go get him
so he's not so lonely I'm all alone
good morning oli

blueberries in his diaper
