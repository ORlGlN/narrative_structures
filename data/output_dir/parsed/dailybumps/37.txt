- Good morning everyone and
welcome to today's vlog.
Happy weekend. We made it.
(laughs)
Missy right now is actually at the ranch,
riding her new horse.
If you guys have not
seen yesterday's video,
I'll have it linked in the iCard
so you can go check it out.
We basically reveal
Missy's brand new horse
that she just got.
His name, what kind of horse
he is, like all that fun stuff.
So be sure to go watch that
video it's super special.
Me and the boys met the horse
for the first time that day
and it was really, really cool.
But I also wanna share one
more thing with you guys
before we get going on today's vlog.
I know a couple of days ago
we told you guys a story
about little Henry who lost
his battle with cancer.
Make-A-Wish had contacted us, you know,
he wanted to meet us and we
wanted to like sing to him
and hang out with him.
Unfortunately, we never made it.
And it's been like really just like
weighing on my heart a lot this week.
I think this has been a really hard week
for both Missy and I.
So we've been kind of using this week
to reflect on all that.
I wanted to let you guys know
that the family does have a GoFundMe page.
I'm gonna link it down
below if you guys, you know,
feel at all called to help
or donate or anything,
feel free to do that there.
We definitely wish that we
would have been able to meet little Henry.
He sounded like such an amazing little boy
and it would have been so fun
just to hang out with him
and sing our songs to him,
but that wasn't able
to happen and you know,
sometimes that's just
the way life works out.
We don't really get all the answers.
So anyway, I'm gonna
have their GoFundMe page
linked down below if you guys would like
to help along with us as well.
But for now, I'm just waiting for Missy
to get back from the ranch,
so that we can have a
fun Friday with the boys.
- Good morning guys!
Good morning my puppies!
Each of my puppies are here.
As soon as I say hi to them
they just like jump up.
Good morning, Ollie.
- Good morning.
- Mornin'
(Finn babbles)
We are actually eating lunch right now.
The boys are having some
peanut butter and jelly's,
and I actually just got
back about an hour ago,
I got back from riding Nacho.
Not for the first time,
I did ride him when I was
looking to purchase him,
but the first time as him
being mine, and it was awesome.
I didn't bring the camera
'cause I just wanted to
really focus on him and it
did take a while to kind of,
you know, get my saddle all figured out,
'cause it's brand new and I've never done
this kind of a saddle
and style just 'cause
there's some new like technologies on it,
'cause it's kind of a fancy
little saddle I guess.
I had so much fun,
I just kind of rode around in the arena
and it was really good.
He's so awesome, like
he just really, really
listens to me as a beginner,
like slows down if he notices that
I'm a little wobbly or unbalanced,
and he was just like so, so awesome.
So patient with me, even
saddling him, oh my gosh,
it took us forever to figure
it out, and he was so patient.
Oh, I just love him!
So yeah, it was a really,
really awesome little time
and I'm excited to go back.
Probably a little later with the boys,
'cause they really wanna see Nacho, huh?
- Yeah.
-  You wanna see Nacho?
(laughs) Hopefully soon
you get to ride him, okay?
- Okay.
- I've been looking at
all kinds of fun stuff
that I can get like the
little buddy saddle,
so Ollie can sit behind
me while I'm riding.
That would be so fun, huh?
- Yeah. I also wanna go in the tree house.
- Oh yeah they have a
tree house at the house.
- And the trampoline.
- And a trampoline, he really
wants to go back and do that.
It was just an awesome
trip and I'm excited.
It's been a fun day, so I actually haven't
been feeling the best
today, so I've been kind of
laying low, and I even have sweats on now,
but I'm hoping that with
a little bit of medicine,
I'll feel a little bit better
and we can head back up
there in a little while.
(Finn babbles)
And play. Sound good?
- Yeah.
I've actually been
sitting here with the boys
and we've been talking
about all the horse rules
and how to stay safe around the horse
'cause with little kids
it is very nerve-wracking
and they are a little bit crazy.
I've just been going
over some of the rules
so I thought I'd let them say,
what is the number one rule, Ollie?
- The one about you
can't go around the back.
-  Okay. So you can't
go around the back because...
- It'll kick you.
-  Good.
(laughs)
Is that right, Finn?
Alright, I'm gonna let
you finish eating, okay?
- Yep.
- Alright you guys so
there has been a present
that we've been wanting to
get the boys for a while now.
We first planned this present when it was
Finn's birthday in October, and we said,
"You know what? We're gonna get them this.
They really enjoy things like this.
We think they'll really
enjoy it for the party."
It never showed up. It never
came, it was never delivered.
It just got stuck.
They ended up canceling my
order and I was like "Ugh."
So then Christmas rolls
around and I'm like
"You know what, this is
my chance. Redeem myself.
Let's get the boys an
awesome Christmas present.
They'll like it as a Christmas
present, it doesn't matter."
I order it, plenty of time in advance.
Still doesn't come in time, you guys.
Still does not come in time.
Then I get it-- (laughs)
and it's missing parts.
I'm missing like four parts.
I have to call the
company, order more parts,
they sent them to me.
Finally we get it done.
So now we have a combination
birthday, Christmas present
that is ready for the
boys to finally open.
It's here.
It is finished.
Alright boys, Happy Birthday!
- Happy Birthday!
- Oh, Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
- Well what is it? Is it your
birthday? Or is it Christmas?
- No it's not Christmas or my birthday.
- It's not either but you know what, boys?
-  What?
- Mommy and Daddy have a present for you.
- You got a present?
- Yeah, come here!
We wanted to surprise you guys
with something really,
really cool for a while now,
and it took a while, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay, you guys wanna go see what it is?
-  Yeah!
- Okay. You excited?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
(upbeat music)
Alright, come on out boys!
Come on out!
(screams)
Whoa it's a giant present!
Rip it open!
Come here, Finn, rip it open!
(laughs)
Tear it off, Ollie!
Tear it!
(paper ripping)
Get it, Finn, get it!
Get it, Finn!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Whoa!
(laughs)
What is it, Ollie?
- Wow!
A volcano!
-  It is kind of
like a big volcano, huh?
- It's got a trampoline!
-  That is so cool!
(laughs)
You guys wanna know what it is?
-  What?
- It's a rock climber.
- Rock climber?
-  Yes, so it has all
different types of climbing
on every single side of it.
Over here there's some ropes,
some handhelds, and guess what?
-  What?
- You guys can make it a game.
The first kid to the top of the volcano,
you grab this flag, and
then you're the winner.
You guys wanna play capture the flag?
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah?
- Alright boys, as soon
as Mommy says "Go!"
You have to race to the
top as fast as possible
and capture the flag, okay?
- Okay.
-  On your mark, get set, go!
(suspenseful music)
-  Whoa!
Ollie!
You are a good climber!
Oh, Finn, look at you buddy!
-  Look at you!
(Bryan yelling)
-  And he's the winner!
Good job!
Pound it, bro!
Hey Finn, you did such
a good job, pound it!
Pound it!
(laughs)
Ollie already got the flag, buddy.
Get it, Finn, yay!
(Missy yelling!)
-  Yay!
-  This is the
coolest climber ever.
It seriously is like a little volcano.
I think it was when we
took Ollie rock climbing
that one day he loved
it so much, I was like,
"We gotta get them a good climber."
So now you can climb all
the way to the top, Ollie.
Here, try on this side.
Come on this side right
here and try to climb up.
Go Finn, go!
See, you guys can be creative
and find your own way
to the top of the mountain, huh?
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah.
And then you guys could even
like, hang out up here, huh?
-  And you can
even play under here.
(Finn babbling)
-  Yeah, and there's a really cool
play area all under here.
Finn or Ollie can have the top and then
the other one can have the bottom.
So what do you guys think?
Is this a good Birthday
slash Christmas present?
-  Yeah!
(Missy laughs)
-  Thank you Mommy and Daddy.
-  You're welcome, Ollie!
-  And Finn.
-  And Finn.
We love you guys.
(Missy kisses Finn)
Have fun, okay?
-  Okay.
-  Whoa, that's kind of cool, huh?
- Yeah.
-  It's like your own little fort.
(upbeat music)
- It is such a beautiful
day today, you guys.
You know how yesterday I was like
"It's kind of chilly,
it's like 50 degrees."
It's gotta be like 80 degrees today.
I actually had to put these down and then
we moved the little play
thing into the shade
'cause we're like "It's so hot."
It feels good in the shade,
but it's definitely a warm day today,
which also makes it harder when
you wanna like ride horses and stuff.
(Finn babbles)
Finn's playing over there.
Ollie's having a blast.
They're both just having a great time,
and I'm just sitting here
enjoying the weather.
I just went and checked on my chickens
and they're doing good.
Got four eggs, so that's pretty nice.
(soft electronic music)
-  How are our fishies doing today?
Look at their nice, beautiful,
(dog barks) clean tank.
Karma!
Karma you're gonna scare the
fish with your barking, okay?
Just say hi.
Our fish have been doing so amazing and
I don't know if you guys can really tell,
but they're getting bigger,
and our coral is getting bigger too.
Look at that one, that
one is doing so good.
Oh, and there's Pearl.
She's our designer clown fish that we got
when we first started.
Ella always looking at dudes like,
"Hey pay attention to me, please."
Look how big she is though!
She's like, double in size, it's crazy.
So yes, our fish are doing very well.
-  Alright, Finn got a little owie,
so Ollie is helping him
make, help him feel better.
You checking his heart?
Does it sound good?
Is that better?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
Oh he's gotta check one more thing, baby.
(mellow music)
- Blood pressure.
-  Okay, he's gotta
check his blood pressure.
(laughs)
How's it look?
- Looks goo, great.
- Ollie has been so cute.
Finn has been really
sad for like 15 minutes
and so Ollie was like officially-
- I need this flashlight.
- Well it's not good to
point that into his eyes.
I know that's sometimes what doctors do,
but you can check his mouth.
Say "Aah."
How's it look?
- Good.
-  Alright, so
now what do you think?
What's your diagnosis?
But what's your diagnosis?
He just needs a Band-Aid?
- Yeah.
-  And you already
gave him a little medicine?
- Yeah.
-  Are you feeling better, Finn?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, okay let's
get you your Band-Aid.
- It's gonna be okay, Finn.
- Okay.
(Missy laughs)
- You have a sweet big brother, huh?
- I've got a surprise for you.
It's a surprise grass scorpion.
(Missy gasps)
-  Is he giving you the scorpion?
- Yeah, it's for him because he likes it.
-  Alright, Ollie really wants to
put his Band-Aid on, it's
on the back of his heel.
Looks good, that feel better?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, you want
a hug from Momma, too?
- Yeah.
- Aww (kisses)
-  Alright the boys are
coming outside one last time
'cause they love this thing so much.
It's kind of been amazing.
It's been preoccupying
them for much of the day.
Which is always fun
and they're just having
so much fun playing on it.
You guys like it?
- Yeah.
-  Okay.
- Thank you.
-  You're welcome.
They're so cute about it too.
But anyway, I think that's
all for today's vlog.
We're gonna put these kiddos to bed.
Hope you guys enjoyed it, if you did,
