hey guys before today's vlog starts we
want to show you a really cool video we
did with tide they are doing a great job
of trying to spread awareness in an
effort to keep children safe and they
actually just partnered up with our good
friends Ellie and Jared and : Katie to
take tides childproof challenge
personally we use the laundry packs
because they're so easy but if you use
them just remember to keep them up keep
them closed
keep them safe so if you're looking for
easy tips on child proofing be sure to
go check those videos out our cousins
rose and Casey just had a beautiful baby
girl and we had a blast making over
their home to the extra safe so click

warming drawer because it's keeping
everything nice and toasty and warm and

Kelly loving it Oh complement to the

also happening this morning Krista from
Salvage Seoul is here she is putting in
a barn door for the playroom look at
that and we're also getting doors put in
at this entrance also and this is what
it looks like on the front oh yeah oh
yeah covers that arch the amazing or
what oh it looks so good oh I'm so
excited just have this closed off if we
need to if it gets a mess in there so
you are amazing Krista hahaha good job
she also put in these really cool baby
gate doors for this entrance to the
playroom that big door too as well so
really excited about this because we can
swing them out and have them open which
we probably will most the time but if
kids are playing in there and getting
crazy we can close them too so that's
really cool she's got to attach some
hardware there too so that they stay
nice and closed I love it though yeah
he's gonna get you alright
Krista has moved on to our closet door
this is actually gonna be really cool
because we're gonna be able to take off
the closet drawer that's in there now
and it's going to give us even more
space which is gonna be neat and this is
the door that's going to go up it's
another barn door a little bit not as
big really cool natural gray colors and
you said all that is restored wood or
reclaim Oh
so this from like an old barn just from
alarm that's so cool
yeah history in your bedroom I love it
alright we are on a Polaris ride with
everybody they all say I'm a crazy
driver what about you guys we're going
through Jurassic
ah
like a good ol phalaris ride in the
morning to wake you
morning guys I don't think I've actually
bought anything today but we've been
doing that so much and look at the
finished product I think Brian showed
you a little bit of what we were doing
but we put a barn door in our closet and
I'm super excited about it there's Brian
I love it I just think it looks so cool
and so rustic especially on this dark
paint yeah yeah it kind of opens it up a
little more closet in here it's gonna be
nice I closed in such a disaster oh yeah
and then the inside actually looks
really cool too it's very just like raw
wood raw wood and it's just got a nice
little handle on it I love it I was like
really kind of nervous about this one
because I wasn't sure if I was gonna
like that really rustic look because
everything else in our house kind of
tends to be a little bit more on the
traditional side I think but I just
think it looks really cool especially
with this yeah we're gonna have
something else in this bedroom that's
gonna match this door me and my dad have
a really big project that we're gonna be
doing and as you guys know we're
incorporating a lot of wood into the
house I love wood I think it looks
really nice so we are going to actually
turn this entire wall behind our bed
into a basically a restored wood wall
yeah
and the colors gonna be so much this
similar tonight yet raised and reds and
so it'll definitely tide that door in a
little bit more with this and I think
the bed will look really cool against
this just like a flood wall project it's
it's inexpensive and it's actually
something that's kind of yeah it's kind
of like I can take it down if I don't
like it it won't be like permanent I
mean I'll have to fix some stuff if I do
take it down but I can put it up and I'm
gonna take it down if I want and I think
I think it'll tie in the lights more
it'll tie on that and then I'm even
thinking about doing maybe a little bit
of wood in front of that fireplace we
don't even think about the fireplace
idea but I'm loving I feel like our
house is like coming together little
projects that can like ants the house in
different ways and I was excited because
Salvage soul who came here and did that
she said she would actually do this wall
but after I thought about I was like me
my dad would love to do that like we
could totally just do it together as a
project so that's why we're at the wood
place the other day to me and my dad cuz
I think we're gonna do it together it
makes my day
if everybody
all right an inappropriate I just pulled
the Katie
this is my candle there we just got this
in I'm really excited before we moved in
here this room actually for the previous
owner was a very big game or like a
sports room so there was couches there
was like 12 TVs on here and here he
patched all that up and we've turned it
into a formal dining room and I love it
I just think that it's as right as you
walk in the house you're gonna see a
beautiful chandelier and a bill dining
table and I definitely getting a piano
soon I'm loving this room and how it's
coming together so all the balls
separate yes so all the balls has to be
put on here I love this gender layer
because it's definitely not like a
really simple it's simple but yet it's
not the it's not a typical chandelier
it's very um what's the word industrial
yeah it's like the long ways so like it
takes up more space yeah and it kind of
makes the room look longer I think like
bigger and stuff so it's really cold all
right
here he is munching on some kiwi and all
kinds yummy stuff it was a sour huh
little sour he's doing so good you guys
I'm loving it and I'm working on a
little fun project over here I found one
of these little videos on Facebook I
think they're called like tasty calm or
something like that and it was for like
an apple pie type of dish but basically
you take like cinnamon rolls and you cut
them up you bake them you cook some
apples on the stove I've got some eggs
and milk and cinnamon mixture here that
I'll be mixing up and then you just like
throw it all together and it supposed to
make like this yummy Apple baked pie
thing but it's not pie it's like almost
like a cake I don't know I'm really
excited about though I've been thinking
about for a long time it even goes the
icing that comes with the senton rolls
you just put it right on top of it and
it sounds really good so let's see how
it turns out calls for a tablespoon of
cinnamon seems like so much good oh my
goodness this is looking so good that's
just all brown sugar
all right so I have my cinnamon roll and
cinnamon egg mixture and then I pour
this over it kind of hard to do
one-handed Missy what have you done
I'm a something oh my goodness Wow
is it gonna overflow it said it 25 to 30
minutes
I put 30 in there it says seven more
minutes though oh you'll be fine
I said 25 to 30 oh I'm gonna take it out
in like a minute or when it hits golden
brown and wow it smells incredible in
here you guys it's crazy it's one of
those crazy videos cooking videos that
no one does everyone just watches them
late at night when they're hungry no not
Missy this is like I'm gonna do that and
I'm gonna show them that that can be
done that's so funny
so different than like when they do it
online like they make it look so like
perfect and then I don't like LOC slop
okay we'll see sure is half the amount
online is mine would look like so much
and theirs was like perfect and like mmm
