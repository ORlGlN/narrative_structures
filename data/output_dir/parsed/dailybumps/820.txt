Cap'n hashtag mom life all right so I
just got done dipping a ton of peanut
butter balls which I am super excited
about you guys have see me roll them dip
them and now I'm getting ready to
package them and they look absolutely
delicious
so every year actually give away peanut
butter balls as gifts to the family and
this is actually when it gets really
chaotic because I'm finishing dipping
all of them and now I have to get ready
to package them all the Ziploc brand
actually helps curb a lot of that
holiday chaos during this time because
other cute designs on their storage bags
and containers and that's cool because I
don't have to waste time wrapping and
putting bows and ribbons on all of the
packages and stuff
also my family knows that when they see
the Ziploc brand containers that they
are about to get some yummy peanut balls
for their presents they start done
putting peanut balls into this container
for my aunt and uncle and it's a really
pretty red for the Christmas time and
then I have it treats in this ziplock
storage bag for my mom and dad and it's
got these cute little festive bulbs on
it am i cute and then I've got a bunch
in this zipper storage bag for all my
cousins which I really love because it's
green and it's got cute little pillows
on it is fun and then I put the leftover
P number balls into this fancy Ziploc
brand freezer bag and I put them in the
freezer to keep them fresh because I
probably forgot someone but let's be
honest they're probably just for me it's
funny because I was just watching a
video that the Ziploc brand put up on
their YouTube channel and I thought it
was so cool they surprised a ton of
people driving to their holiday
destination with family travel kits in
Ziploc brand storage bag which made the
holiday travel a little easier and less
chaotic and I thought it was really cute
so go check it out by clicking the
screen or the link in the description
and shout out
to the Ziploc brand for sponsoring
today's video and for making such cute
packages for my yummy peanut balls
headed to target we are missing like a
lot of main essentials for the house
especially dinner stuff anyone sick and
tired of like making dinner and thinking
of food to eat for dinner like it's just
exhausting like planning your meals and
stuff I feel like it gets old really
fast I wish I had like a chef the Sun is
setting right now and I have been
spending my day organizing all my
Christmas presents making sure
everyone's got what they're supposed to
get because I ordered a lot of stuff
online and I'm feeling really good I
feel like I got everyone a good amount
of gifts that like it equals out for
everyone I was not about the gifts or
the number of gifts or know what you
spend it's not it's about the love
behind it it is ladies and gentlemen
it's the true meaning of Christmas I'm
just saying
begins that I got you it's priceless
what a bracelet I feel like every year
me and Brian have a competition and who
can get each other's a better gift and
he always wins always think he's really
better present with you I always didn't
know exactly what he's doing but I don't
know what you're doing this year
and I don't think you know what I'm
doing this if I am doing anything that's
true I might just win by default
