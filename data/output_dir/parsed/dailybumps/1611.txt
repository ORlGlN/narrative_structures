Shay tober and it also means in six days

noticed yet I got chocolate on me and
I'm pretty much just like a mess oh my
god of course you would since I made
cupcakes I am easily able to figure out
how many calories so I'm gonna try and
talk Brian into eating only 130 calories
for this yeah I'm gonna don't know whose
cupcake okay I got you
hey that was Tim is only 30 calories
okay that's a tablespoon yeah I measured
it out even okay and how much is the
cupcake 100 you can do that let me see
