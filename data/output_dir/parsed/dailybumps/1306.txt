Raghu here it's a sock Oh got it got it
I guess I gotta show you this really
cool carrier that I just got from my
friend Cecilia she said it to me and her
husband designed this carrier it's by me
Amelie and it's called the hipster and I
am seriously in love with it I actually
am obsessed with it right now so her
husband their parents look at the color
I know okay I gotta show it to you guys
so it's by me Amelie it's a lot like
their go but it has this really cool
seat for your child so number one is
that this actually can be used just to
carry your kids check this out if I want
to just like have him on me he can sit
on this as well as like on my hip and I
don't have to like go like that I can
just stand up straight and you can see
like this I just know
Han and it's like and the seat I guess
designed so that their legs aren't
dangling yes Vanessa that's really
important to your child really shouldn't
be the lake should be dangling they
should be in sort of a seated position
kind of like that and so this keeps it
so that they are so if they're like this
as well as check this out mommy's not
facing they can front he can totally
front face now that's so cool this is
just the first part but it also has a
carrier like the Ergo yeah all I have to
do is attach this you just slip it on
boat and then it snaps right here Missy
is totally nerding out about this you
guys she's so excited of course you can
just carry them like the Ergo and it's
got his little seat right here
um but then you can face it outwards and
then it goes up like this and also came
with the teething pads too on it U is
good because he's always sucking on the
stress just like the Ergo does just like
in the back so he can forward face we
can have ours it's got his legs and it's
got vision pocket oh yeah this out to
you guys so if it's kind of a hot day
sometimes these can be a little bit warm
to warm to hold you can just unzip this
thing and now it's cool it's enough it's
got this mesh pattern so now it's a lot
cooler so it healed and then you can you
zip this right back
also just slip my phone into here oh my
gosh look at this
see ya Cecilia and her husband actually
designed this thing so I think it's just
so cool because it's actually designed
my parents they have a little girl
adorable little girl and so this
actually isn't released they sent us
this and they just launched a
Kickstarter so you guys should
definitely go check out the Kickstarter
I'll have a link below in the
description so you can check it out but
basically these things are going to be
going for a lot more than you're going
to get it for on Kickstarter so I'm
kick-started you're definitely going to
get a deal so go check it out they've
already made five grand babe I know not
awesome drop suicide so it's less for
you to have to have on okay so you can
actually have a little I just this is so
cool this little seat I love it I can't
stand straight you can just sit on it
and it's good posture for him and you
and so Missy got this and she was like
geeking out so much is so funny so you
gonna wear it today while we go do some
errands yeah
load up kid we're gonna go do some
shopping okay look at he's playing with
a ball a monkey and his water bottle in
the pet bed this is like ollie right
here in a nutshell hey Oliver are you
are you in a good mood or a bad mood can
tell us what would you describe your
mood as I'm gonna say it about actually
funny I don't know if I'm can catch it
on camera but he does this new thing
with his face where he with his more
like with his mouth that he'll go fellow
clown he like plays with his tongue it's
really weird I think he's kind of trying
to like learn the talk and like
experimenting with his mouth it's really
weird because I am
real-world testing of the hipster it
worked I went to the bathroom and it
worked
yep my gosh I'd wash my hands and then I
like had to turn the blow dryer on and
he did it's like shaky thing which he
does sometimes but it's obviously
because the sound that's so funny and

really cool video of you know showing
him like from birth and I just need to
stop I need to just
relax and realize that all that stuff
doesn't have to happen right away I feel
like I put unneeded time restraints on
myself and it's mostly due to me just
wanting everything to be perfect all the
time I put a lot of pressure on myself
that I don't need to you know just you
guys does anyone else do this I put a
lot of pressure on myself for things to
be perfect because I'm very passionate
about our YouTube channel and I want
everything to be perfect
but I just have to realize that I'm
human and things just take time so
that's what I'm doing I'm trying to just
let it go let it go but anyway I did
wanna let you guys know we put out a new
video on and Missy's channel so go check
