-  Good morning.
- Good morning Ollie, how
are you feeling today?
- Good.
- Good?
He has no fever today.
I think he is all better,
and it seems to have lasted like 24 hours.
He had a fever all day yesterday.
We've been keeping up on
his medicine and stuff.
But he looks good, so now you
get to play with your friends.
We've got Carl and Ginger's kids over.
We got Luke and Gage and
Kyle's probably somewhere.
And it is, guess what?
What is today?
- Daddy's birthday.
- So we're going to make
him some breakfast right?
-  Yeah.
- We're making our famous pancakes.
So we've got the old
fashioned, plain pancakes.
We've got chocolate with chocolate chips.
And then we've got over here,
chocolate chips but there
is banana all in it.
He loves banana.
So I think he's going
to love this breakfast,
and we're gonna go ahead
and start cooking now.
(soft music)
Alright, he's out and about.
He's still working on his birthday, so.
- Thanks, babe.
-  You got smiley face
banana chocolate chip pancakes.
- So cute.
-  Finn, how do
you like the pancakes?
- Um, good.
-  Good? Okay, good.
Alright, breakfast is done
and I am now baking cakes
for Bryan and he actually asked
for something very specific.
I think he's asked for
it probably every year,
and I just can't imagine making it
because it just doesn't
sound appetizing to me,
but I think to a lot of
people, they're going to think
wow, this is gonna be delicious.
But anyways, I'm making a
three layer chocolate cake
with raspberry filling inside of it.
Which does not sound good to me,
but he's always wanted it,
so I'm making it right now.
And the raspberry is gonna be
hopefully from scratch if I can get--
This doesn't seem like very many,
so my dad's bringing up
some more raspberries,
but we'll see how much he makes,
but he does want it seedless.
Which means I have to strain it all
and get all the seeds out
before I can actually make the sauce,
so we'll see how it turns out.
(soft music)
- The zip line.
-  Yeah, it is a
beautiful day out here,
so we are showing Gage,
Luke, and Kyle our zip line.
Have you ever done a zip line, Luke?
- Um, I have once and I fell off.
-  Well this one
we're really safe with.
Make sure there's lots of supervision.
Are you excited?
- Yeah, I'm super excited.
- Was that fun?
- Yeah.
-  You did so good, Finn.
Aw, this is so cool.
Hanging with my boys on my birthday.
Check out the sky too,
it's like a beautiful day.
Alright, here comes Kyle.
He might be a little big.
Keep your feet up.
Feet up.
He did it.
I don't think anyone heavier
than him could even try.
We kind of designed it
for like, four year olds.
- It's a zip line in the backyard.
- I know, how cool is that?
- Let's do this.
- Woo, let him go.
Whoa.
Nice catch.
How was that Ollie?
- Was that fun?
- Yeah.
- You know what you kind of sound like
when you're coming down
on that wire, Ollie?
He sounds like a TIE
fighter from Star Wars.
Doesn't it?
Oh hey Finn, what are you doing?
Finn just found this piece of wood.
And he's like, I'm just
gonna sit here and chill.
I love you, dude.
You know where those gold shoes are from?
- What?
-  From my EP release party.
- Oh really?
-  For like a lion, yeah.
I think those were the
ones that Ollie wore.
- Vote down in the comments
below, who has cooler shoes?
-  Finn's like,
mine are pretty cool.
(upbeat music)
- Okay, the raspberry sauce seems
to have turned out pretty good.
It's pretty thick, it's not a ton though,
so hopefully it's enough,
and I'm trying to make a three layer.
I've got one layer here,
the other layer completely fell apart,
and so my dad came up with
oil and three of these.
So I have two Ghirardelli boxes in here,
and I'm hoping they turn out better.
You think they're going to be better?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so I think I'm gonna
finish with this one as well.
That way, maybe I'll just make this one
a regular chocolate cake
because I can't believe
I'm going to put raspberry in
my delicious chocolate cake.
- Alright, we're winding
down and watching some shows.
Finn cannot even keep his eyes open.
- He's almost out.
- And...I think we lost him.
(music box melody)
Good night, Finn.
- Alright, the birthday
celebrations are starting to begin.
I mean, we've been celebrating all day,
but we've got this delicious cake.
It was going to be three, now it's two,
because it's started falling apart.
And we attempted to make
a 28 but you can't tell.
Now it just looks ridiculous.
- Papa, can you go grab
the gasoline please?
We're just going to douse
it in one shot, you know.
I'm trying, I'm getting
them primed, the wicks.
- Okay, this is actually
ridiculous, like...
- Yeah, who bought these
candles? They have no wicks.
-  Where's
that blow torch you had?
- It's at the barn.
- We actually just pulled
the tops off of some Q-tips.
- Now you're not going to know
if it's white chocolate or wax.
(laughing)
(upbeat music)
- See, these candles are basically done
and those ones aren't lit yet.
- Okay, ready?
Okay, three, two, one,
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday dear Bryan ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
-  Yay!
- Wait, last one, last one.
- Oh my god.
Hurry, it's about to go out.
- We did it, it's gonna explode.
-  Yay!
- Look, you can clearly tell
which candles were lit first.
-  Happy Birthday Daddy.
- Thanks buddy, high five.
Come here.
-  Bryan, I
hope your wishes come true.
(babbling)
- What are you saying?
(babbling)
- What?
What is this noise you're
making with your mouth?
Alright, Missy made me a very yummy cake,
and I'm so excited.
- What do you mean?
- I don't know, it took me really all day.
-  I'm sorry.
Ooooh.
-  I want one, I want one.
- How's that look, Finn?
- Good.
- That looks so good.
It has a raspberry filling too?
-  Yep.
It's raspberry filling.
-  Thanks, babe.
-  Okay, how is it?
Oh, he's been trying it?
What do you think?
- Finn always gets the first bite.
-  Good?
Yeah.
-  He's like, it
tastes like chocolate cake.
- Good, good.
That's what he said.
This raspberry filling looks dope.
-  Is it good?
- Yes.
-  It's not--
- It reminds me of the chocolate
tower cake at PF Chang's.
-  Oh, yeah.
And that's a very dark chocolate.
What do you think of the dark chocolate?
It seemed very dark chocolate.
- I love it.
- Mine, mine.
- What?
No, mine.
- Mine.
No, mine.
- Oh, is that one yours?
I love this guy, you're so funny.
Okay Finn, you feed me now, okay?
-  Okay, feed Daddy.
Good job.
That's so nice of you.
- Feed Daddy again.
- No, mine.
- Oh, is that one yours?
-  No, mine.
Alright, it is finally present time.
Bryan has been looking
at this giant present.
- Finn, are you so excited?
- Yeah.
-  Do you know what it is?
- Yeah.
-  Don't say, okay?
- Okay.
-  It's a secret.
- Okay.
- I think this present is
almost taller than you,
it's as big as you are.
Come here, how about you?
Oh see, you're taller.
-  You're definitely taller.
- Okay, should I open it?
What are these?
-  Um, just other presents.
You should probably
open the big one first.
- Oh, okay.
It's like a match.
-  We wrapped it good, huh Ollie.
- Did you boys help mama?
- Yeah.
- What is it?
- Oh my god, whoa.
-  It's a telescope.
- Oh my god, are you serious?
-  Yeah.
- Look at this.
-  He's been asking for
a telescope for a while now.
- This is so cool babe.
I would love being outside and like,
we look with our phones
and see certain things.
-  Yeah.
And this one will literally,
you'll say, I want to see Jupiter,
it'll find Jupiter and
like, show it to you.
- Are you kidding me?
That is amazing.
-  Yay, he likes it.
- Thanks guys.
-  He's like,
thanks I picked it out.
- Mimi and Papa.
- Don't you guys know?
This is my baby shower.
- What is that?
- I don't even know what it is.
Power tank.
Oh it's a mobile power
station with a spotlight
for the telescope.
-  Nice.
- Perfect, thanks guys.
Another one?
Okay what's this one, what's this one?
Oh, it's a smartphone holder.
-  Oh that's so funny.
- That's so cool.
-  That's cool.
It'll attach to the--
- It's the most high-tech telescope ever.
That's crazy.
-  Yeah, you
can set it up somewhere
and you can look at stars.
- Alright, we are now
getting ready to head out.
We are having a little
birthday dinner for moi,
and we're all ready for the night.
These boys are going to bed.
That's right.
-  You're tired, you're tired.
-  You tired buddy?
Yeah.
Kyle, I love your batman PJs.
You look so dope, dude.
Hey boys, you want to end the vlog?
- Yeah.
- Say, thanks for watching.
(babbles)
- Say, give the video a thumbs up.
Subscribe, and we'll see you mañana.
What do you say?
- Bye.
