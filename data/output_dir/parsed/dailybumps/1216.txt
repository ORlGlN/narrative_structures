we had to get up super early this
morning because we're actually going to
be at Disneyland before they open
because it's basically Jared in Ellie's
first time so it's kind of exciting it
had to take them to like a few place
actually
Jared's first time ever it is I'm I can
my favorite thing in the whole world is
to do something with someone who they've
never done before but I've experienced
it because I love like feeling other
people's joy like I really did I'm so
excited to take Jared and Ellie spent
once when she was younger which is I'm
still really excited to not be look what
we got today in the mail you guys

so much that we had to order another one

grab it we'll throw some snacks in the
backpack so let's see what we got draw
very crispy choose stone those look good
black and white granola cocoa and
vanilla flavor
I love granola do we got pistachio power
clusters whole wheat raspberry cookie

told Jared I was like Missy apologizes
because she's so slow he's like whew
can finally keep up you drive so slow
Missy that Jared actually caught dancing
in there that have a dance party we're
at Disneyland were actually we've been
waiting a lot of lines so far but I
think once we get in there we're gonna
go to California ventures first cuz it
seems like it's going to be a little bit
calmer we hopefully won't be waiting in
as much lines while we wait we are
letting the boys hang out
they're so cute yeah are you having fun
Jackson
yeah always check out this little tray I
just got yesterday so it actually is an
accessory that you can purchase at like
Babies R Us that attaches to it and it
attaches really easily you just like
push this button and it like pops in and
pops out and I love it I don't know what
how I've been living without a tray for
this long because now you can just have
snacks and drink and it's just so
convenient so it actually also figured
out how to undo this top straps up here
so that he just has like the belt strap

the Hollywood Tower you have no idea
what happens though right now we're just
getting in a normal service elevator

Justin elevator yeah Center because
we're that's where we're going is up
yeah definitely this spooky it's nothing
to me
it's a male area yeah you know there's
don't pay any attention to the cobwebs
of the fly eggs oh my gosh
so I guess it wasn't quite the most
normal elevator that was a weird
elevator I apologize
usually they just go up and stomp this
one went up and down and up and down and
up and down Hey look how cute this is
now a bugs land and there's riding this
little caterpillar through the
watermelon and the cookie box

as he ran in to try and retrieve it
found it turns out it was actually in
the stroller we're like waiting for the
train to come by all you have to leave
your shoes on buddy
so we just plowed through two Chinese
food boxes full of food down here at the
Pacific Wharf
so there's like Francisco pretty much
this is like the San Francisco area of
Disney California and I think this is
like my favorite area look what Missy
got you guys
a salad in a bread bowl that's so a
track and they give you this extra piece
of bread that you smother that sourdough
oh so good

in California Adventure it's called The
Sorcerer's workshop and it's this huge
room it's air-conditioned so it feels
amazing and they have like tons of
concept art and like videos from
different movies I guess cycles through
up here's what Monsters Inc

just want to say one more time about the

so many of you guys for this small
amount of time that we actually had at
the Meetup
I think we got to meet probably between
60 to 70 people basically we were able
to be everyone who showed up between
like 3:30 and like 4:20
luckily the Disneyland staff was
actually so kind because after they told
us to split up I was like we just say
bye to everyone really really quick and
give everyone a hug he's like yeah you
could do that and so he was so nice at
least he was able like I was able to
actually do that I say hi to everyone
who was there you know you're so sorry
we feel so bad for everyone who showed
up just a little bit later hoping to see
us like it just breaks our heart
I wish there would have been some way
for us to meet you
we were at that point we were being
followed by security and they were like
you need to stop so I feel really bad we
know that a lot of people did drive
quite far to get to us but I hope that
you guys were able to at least enjoy
your you know the rest of your
California vacation well thank you so
much for giving us such an amazing
Meetup

point pretty much we can't do casual
meet ups and actually what a cool thing
to say like at this point like so many
people love us and just want to see us
in a way and now we're just going to
kind of have to do a little bit more
professional ones we can't just do
casual ones and we know now hopefully
