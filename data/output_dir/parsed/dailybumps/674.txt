the balls this is just like when we got
only this thing and he played with the
box huh I think he likes it cuz it makes
noise good morning guys it is a
beautiful day out here in the country
this morning oli and I actually walked
around all the house and we watered all
of these plants so we have a ton of
plants that are in pots and I think the
original owner she left these I think
what she wanted to do was start growing
these in these pots and then when
they're mature enough transplant them
into the yard so I actually completely
spaced that you're supposed to water
these until they started dying a little
bit oli and I went around the entire
property and watered them all so
hopefully they're not dead and look at
Carmen
throw the ball throw the ball Katina
throw the ball contain the ball
container go get it yeah so hopefully
they come back to life today I plan
tackling my office it's just a huge mess

super excited about this because I had
to have something for storage because I
have lots of like camera stuff GoPro
stuff just stuff that needs to be put
away in a specific place so I actually
got this really cool desk system those
two hutches are gonna hang on the walls

to find a place for everything now but I
love it this is like the same kind of
style that holds our TV in the living
room and I think it's perfect it's gonna
look really cool I did hook up the TV in
here with the ps4 and I really want to
start playing Uncharted 4 because I've
