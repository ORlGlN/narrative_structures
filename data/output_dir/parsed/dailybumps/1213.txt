we're not bringing it back it's really
really sad it's kind of hard it's kind
of bittersweet it is yeah we had a lot
of fun doing the show but like I mean
all good things have to come to an
engine exactly we don't want to like run
the show into the ground and we're kind
of at the point where we just had to
make a decision we kind of want to focus
on other projects and other things
doesn't mean we're done my baby
we may end up doing something else on
baby league we're not sure but we had
fun and we loved the episodes they're
hard to film I'm going but the end
result when they're done
it's we feel still like watching them
back it's like look at him grow and like
and just go through all those changes
when we started he just got there and
now he's like running out of the shots
and so partially why it's hard to keep
