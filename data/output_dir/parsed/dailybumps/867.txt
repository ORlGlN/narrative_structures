elephant le hey by the way kid are you
gonna put on some pants today he's gonna
wear your diaper all day oh he says
he'll put on pants when mom is often
okay today it's just you know we're just
trying to fill these days with
distractions just trying to distract
Missy from the fact that she's still
pregnant and contracting and
I just got to give it up for her going
through what she's been going through
these past couple weeks the prodromal
labor you know the early labor
contractions her doctor saying maybe
this is it keep trying and do things and
kind of it all not working takes a lot
of guts and a lot of patience to do what
she's doing just trying to wait for her
body to do the natural thing and start
having this baby since she is overdue
though there are some risks that are
coming up that we have to be mindful of
she does have an appointment on Monday
to talk to her midwife and to see if she
can even go any farther because at a
certain point the placenta starts to
break away from the uterine wall the
baby could also have its first bowel
movement and when babies first have
their bowel movements it's called the
meconium it's a really sticky like black
tar like substance and that can get into
the water and then get into their lungs
and then that poses risks for after
they're born so it's kind of kind of
getting down to the wire honestly for
how much longer we can do this but her
midwives are giving her really great
instructions and they're super smart
they know what they're doing so we're
just trying to trust them and hope it
all turns out also while I'm out today
guys I'm going to be trading in some
games at Gamestop these are all games
that I've gotten for my ps4 that I've
either played all the way through and
beaten or played through halfway and
lost interest my favorite of these games
is probably Call of Duty advanced
warfare that was a lot of fun and I'm
trading in destiny because I'm gonna get
destiny the taken king cuz Jarret

it anymore I'm having contractions and
they heard but I'm waiting for them to
become more regular it's like my life
it's so draining I'm kind of tired of
talking about it to be honest and I
would stop talking about it but it's all
I think about all day long cuz they're
just like I'm like over who haven't
heard like maybe there'll be another one
let it hurt more next time and every
time and sometimes I feel another one
but it's not as painful or whatever
