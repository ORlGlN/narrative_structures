there Ollie oh really
cool breaking out the good old fashioned
throat coat before I had to rehearsal
seem to have my congestion under control
my throat making it so that I'm not
coughing and stuff but I have lots of
her CIL's so this one's mainly just
gonna be able to like fill out the band
and the setlist
and then other ones that can focus on
actually singing and stuff but it's
interesting how when you stop seeing for
a long time you have to like kind of
retrain yourself kind of like getting on
a bike I've been on one in a long time
which that reminds me I have a job I get
a long time either but when I was in the
studio my my voice was so like
disciplined because I was recording
every day and it was easy but when you
take long breaks like this just it's a
little harder so I got my throat oh hey
Ollie did you see our new chickens yeah
you did
they're really cool look at they're in
the cage oh don't let Susan out chickens
are doing good they were being a little
loud and obnoxious yesterday I think we
should be able to let them out and let
them hang out with all these ladies what
oh the chickens I know
are there any eggs in there no how I got
very excited all right come on buddy hey
Ollie don't make a mess buddy Finn that
goes for you too
oh all right me and the boys are getting
ready to head out and I want to show you
Finn's new car seeds he's graduated to
in one of these car seats before but
then we went back because he just wasn't
happy again and I still don't think he's
technically happy he's not really happy
no matter what if he's in the car but I
thought you know it's time to get him an
official one instead of the baby carrier
that he's been using for so long and so
yeah we got this navy blue one and I
like it it's comfy huh
you can still sleep in it and replace
like I don't know I just hate the car
hon do you just hate the car so me and
tau are braving Target with all four
kids two in there one here one here and
it was up of the strap but it's like
under his chin but it seems to be
keeping him in here so it's all it
really matters right
what's up she's very excited about the
target doggie sitting up here he says
it's looking at him yeah we're gonna
take all four kids and we're going
shopping for house stuff they were smart
and brought an iPad
Levi oh your phone yeah I found this I
might have to hand mine over to me and
town made it out of Target and why we
are now meeting up with the boys and
we're gonna get some dinner but I did
make one mistake and that is I forgot
diapers and wipes and this kitchen book
and he smells so bad
waiting for Brian to get here so that we
can get a fresh diaper in some way the
kids are over here opening some eggs
also watched Jeffrey's blog to see what
they're doing they're very excited about
it you guys have been hanging out all
day having fun haven't you and we just
got back to the house and I have some
bad news
are you ready for the bad news your
hatch Amol didn't hatch it didn't hatch
yeah look at you guys I do it didn't
hatch bro it's it's dead tied stop
that's how far it got this one might
even feel it alive but the wrestling
guide so we have to we have to hatch it
by ourselves
no it's dead the whole thing is dead
yeah I've been shaking
maybe that's why dead one time it was
away for a few minutes yeah it's nothing
like the other one which is packing peg
and piggy if it fell asleep you wake up
right yeah and that's the thing we know
how these are most because we have one
and this one seriously never finished
pecking good we've been trusting and
we'll take time I don't think it works
shake it rabbit cuddle it nothing which
is really sad but you know what I think
that hatch smells is teaching kids a
life lesson because not a X hatch right
we always lose some you always see
that's just biology it's just life we
lost an egg not gonna have a furry
hatching a fun but seriously I wonder if
we deliver it by c-section you think we
should give it a little more time yeah
no this is definitely been a hatch Amol
disaster right you guys
hatching will fail okay
they were literally just asking me to
anybody national and I'm like I know I
got I got this one so that I could play
with it and it turned out to get dad I'm
sorry Liv are you sad you're trying to
wake it up I don't know what's gonna
happen
