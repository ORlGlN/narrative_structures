in yesterday's vlog were given Missy a
lot of flack for waking me up in the
middle of the night to change all of our
diaper the routine is Missy will
breastfeed and then she'll wake me up to
change his diaper and a lot of people
are like why do you wake Brian up to
change his diaper when you're already up
well the truth is is I'm his parent too
and we don't want Missy doing all the
work like that would not be fair at all
and I want Missy to wake me up because I
want to change the site but I want to
help I don't want to be one of those
dads who just sleeps through the night
well my wife has to get up like two or
three times you know
to breastfeed and change his diaper so I
want to get up and I want to do it and
she doesn't wake me up every single
night it's like she a lot of the times
if she knows I'm up late and I've been
working a lot
she'll just let me sleep and she'll go
do it but some nights she will wake me
up to do it and I appreciate it because
I want to help out and stuff
so I just want to clarify that I also do
want to clarify a lot of people have
noticed I'm not filming at the office
anymore well I quit doing the office and
I'm now working solely from home so
essentially we have to stay at home
parents which is really really cool
obviously I do a lot of work from home
still I just wanted to help out more I
think and it worked out perfectly for us
so I'm super stoked about that
that's exciting huh Oliver psych yeah I
like having you around but anyway I'm
gonna go ahead in the vlog just because
