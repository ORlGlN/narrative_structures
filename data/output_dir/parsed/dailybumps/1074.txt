I think they loved it I can't wait to
hear what they think of it I think the

they always do crazy stuff
that was one of the coolest most
exhilarating things I've ever done
did you like it is like fun I was never
very like afraid but I was never I feels
like I feel like - is it'll heal yeah
yeah yeah oh my god so cool you
guys I got a certificate though that was
so much fun
shout out to I fly in full screen for
putting this together and hooking us up
because that honestly was one of the
coolest things I've ever done it was
cool too because our instructor said
afterwards that this is actually harder
to do than actual skydive which kind of
makes me feel like whoo I would love to
do that then you know I guess most of
the thrill is actually just jumping out
of the airplane and the views and stuff
but that was so much fun it was so
amazing so now I think we're just going
to explore a little bit of city walk
