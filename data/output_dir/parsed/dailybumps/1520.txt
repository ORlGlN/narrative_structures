gonna do amazing things
good morning guys it's Saturday morning
I started I was in the strength of love
like this this morning I'm eatin cold
pizza watching Saturday morning cartoons
Karma's begging bad boy no you do not
bug nope Canadian bacon pineapple best
pizza
cold in the morning no joke look at our
new room you guys everything's all set
up all differently and cool and freshen
the windows will be open you pour some
light in here you see we're gonna get up
and we're gonna move around we're gonna
do things and we're gonna be productive
hey hey hey there's my boy what's up
dude what's up hey and it's going on I'm
gonna be honest you smell like spit up I
woke up his mom with quite the fountain
of spit up on her didn't you
what do you want to do today you wanna
play with Sophie - Sophie come on give
her a hug No okay
oh you know just rolling over like a
boss still and we'll go back use one to
driver a little bit huh
good morning guys I am up and ready and
Olly is still not look I have been
removing his clothes lately because he's
just so gross that I just rather clean
him up rather than changes outfits a
million times today but we're gonna get
interesting now but you are so slobbery
it's not even funny kind of busy we're
trying to figure out our um trip because
we're flying we're just gonna be
interesting with a baby I've never flown
with a baby I go I only have ever flown
is by myself it's like the only time we
fly is just like alone when cuz that's
all we could afford and so now me and
Brian and Ollie are all flying together
and so it'll be X range interesting with
you but it's weird cuz when you buy your
tickets you don't um buy a ticket for
Oliver because he's so young he can just
sit on our lap and stuff you have to
call them later and add him on and then
you in order to have like proof of age
you need either a birth certificate or
something else Frank what what are you
doing yeah what you gonna take him so I
can pick out an outfit for him oh Jesus
pass off you got that
oh he's really shy I know holding him on
so shiny
okay anyway so we need something to like
prove his age so I went online and I was
like okay I'm gonna find um him a birth
certificate and order it but it's really
expensive and then it takes like forever
to order birth hibbett we had to then
order like a fast path fast shipping
thing and then altering that you don't
need that anything that proves his age
so I'm like oh my god so and then we
paid for the first if it probably not
even gonna get it in time and if we do
we don't need it okay
outfit mmm how cute do we want him to be
I've got one
oh my god six six okay we'll make all
the other babies jealous that's cool um
but then you have to wear a long sleeve
onesie underneath it
a monkey with stars on it that's cute
sweet you home it is No
Oh what the dummies r7d alright so we
just got done filming some videos I love
and more productive and we get videos
done because I mean if you don't know we
do like what we do seven videos on the
daily because it's every day and do
three videos on my channel and then two
videos on his channel a weeks that's
twelve videos a week that's a lot of
videos and so it's nice when we get them
kind of going so they're like I don't
know it's just good when we're
protective um but I don't know Brian
yesterday showed these but I don't know
if he showed them from like the view
this out here it's really cool yeah I
was gonna name like a row
I seriously need to like I don't I think
it's fine it's already really woo it's
really bright
how's that so yeah can you see it pace
yeah it's a little bit too right you see
it ah don't go into the light yeah
that's what it looks like it's really
pretty and then this is what it looks
like over here cuz he showed like a
close-up give you like a out like a it
sounds looks so cool no yeah the burlap
like it almost looks like it's um the
mat it looks like a most like burlap mat
but it's not it's kind of like they're
like load loading it's really cool
they're stuck between two glasses it was
very hard to do anyways it's lunchtime
and I'm starving okay yeah this thing is
just about done this rock and play he
literally can like flip all the way
around he can sit up in it you literally
can just like push himself up well there
he goes
um the strap doesn't even like fit
around him so if we do put a minute he
has to be like watched very carefully ha
you're silly
jack up smile save it in a file
I know anyways yeah so he can do
basically all kinds of things in this
little contraption to mommy and baby
smile please stop it don't do that good
this is the Idahoan in me leftover
mashed potatoes and gravy pretty much
bomb and definitely hitting the spot
right just ate a light lunch cuz I'm
thinking that we're gonna go out tonight
gonna try and do a double date didn't
think Missy and I have you been on
double date I guess we found on a few
double dates but my buddy John and I
haven't hung out in a while so we're
gonna go out and try and go to one of
those places where they like cook the
food in front of you and like bling it
around I think that'd be so cool I've
never done that anything like fancy like
that um so should be fine i'ma try and
do that I'm gonna try and get some
editing work done where you gonna be
karma I'm gonna stand guard over me
got a crying baby down there we got the
crying baby down there yes we do yes Oh
crack baby growing baby oh boy getting
really tired huh we're gonna have a nap
I'm actually gonna try a bottle today
because the other day I tried a bottle
and he really didn't like it and
obviously I want him to be able to do a
bottle if you want but I also don't like
doing it very often so I'm gonna make a
bottle and having do that for his net
maybe like for nap time I'll do a bottle
or something I'm not sure hopefully he's
not totally against bottles that would
kind of suck because I pump and I have
the milk I might be able to use it
although I am thinking about making a
video about things you can do it breast
milk that might be interesting tell me
if you guys actually want to see that
because I know a lot of it and I don't
really use it enough thinking about
doing something fun with it yeah like I
saw this breast milk so we have a
problem we're all dressed and ready to
go and we're headed out with some
friends tonight and Oliver decided to
choose this night to refuse his bottle
so mrs. mom had volunteered to babysit
him while we were gone but we tried it
out earlier today and he's just not
going for it
it's the same thing in here bro
different delivery system yeah same
thing no gotta get over a seam and get
my mommy
hmm so he did take it for a little bit
we're hoping Missy's just gonna feed him
and then we're hoping he'll be good and
then by the time that they go to feed
him maybe he'll be so hungry that he'll
just take it sometimes it is better
you're not like in the room yeah so if
I'm not here maybe he'll be more likely
to take it you guys have any suggestions
please leave them in the comments cuz
that kind of sucks are those your boots
yeah I've never seen you wear those
boots did you buy those secretly no we
bought them around here oh really
for wood you are on the moms of you oh I
was starting to worry there I thought I
was gonna have to take him with me but I
fed him hopefully he's good my plan is
to have like my mom like kind of like
every 10 minutes just like try and feed
in the bottle like once he gets hungry
and then um just keep trying if I'm not
there hopefully works so I got to tell
you worth it like this is supposed to be
like a date night and we're supposed to
like be like a night to like relax and
no baby and stuff and I'm like totally
stressed like so stressed don't stress
I'm so stressed I take care of my baby
