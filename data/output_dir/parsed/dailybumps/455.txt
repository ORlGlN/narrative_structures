hold on to it open it soon I just
cleaned up Oliver's playroom what we
actually cleaned it up together and we
got rid of a ton of toys yeah it always
feels good to get rid of toys huh I'm
actually pretty impressed with how good
he is I think he's used to it right now
because I've go through his 20 bucks
every few months and I pretty much just
like get rid of anything that isn't like
a sentimental item really kind of clean
it out and I always tell him that we're
gonna donate it to other kids he
actually will usually help me go through
all his toys and say you would give this
to other kids and give this to other
kids so it's kind of nice he's just kind
of used to it yeah and he said he gets
toys later cuz christmas is coming up
and you get more toys ha so he is pretty
understanding to that which I'm really
impressed with as a three-year-old
that's pretty cool I just went through
all his toys we got rid of a bunch of
stuff and actually a lot of stuff I'd
already gotten rid of and I think a bag
had come in from the garage that had
previously gotten rid of it never got
donated and got dumped into the trash or
into the playroom so got rid of a ton of
stuff and we're gonna donate those
pretty soon what'd you say he is the
best dog ever huh your boy loves you so
much so we are gonna open up three days

actually have a couple that we didn't do
bringing me Christmas cards today for me
me and
Papa so we're gonna make some Christmas
cards I'm gonna roll some peanut butter
balls we're gonna try and get a bunch
done because there's three days till
Christmas and I've barely got anything
been sleeping though so I'm gonna get a
bunch of stuff done right now so I got
my pan butter out
I started rolling I got about one layer
and two balls and they're like really
not very good those are super round
right and I literally could not roll any
more I don't know what's wrong with me
but I'm just like pooped I feel like so
exhausted and fins up now and when fins
up I'm pretty sure everything stops so
Ollie you wanna go get Finn you playing
with your toys um see I finish up I've
barely got any balls rolled I think I
just need to have like a peanut butter
ball rolling party that way it feels
like it's going faster because I
literally stopped definitely fifteen
minutes I like ten balls then I was like
oh my god and I don't want to do this
anymore
let's graph it good mining Peru
how did you sleep your brother wants to
say hi oh my goodness you boys are crazy
can get Finn a hug give me a kiss and
say good morning whoa you know what
Ollie we haven't found Fred yeah and
yesterday the Grinch Adam do you think
he's okay
yeah yet I can't find him he always been
looking for him all morning but I think
it's time we finally find him yeah okay
let's go find him I know hi and you
never found him today huh no I guess he
could me oh no he's still a little
freaked out about that Grinch he's like
I didn't see the Grinch but he was in
the house and he's a little scared oh my
gosh so fast oh my goodness what is he
doing
said no no no no he
he's gonna take all your stuff huh you
know what what's he wearing
I saw he's actually wearing a little
rain jacket why is he wearing a rain
jacket but it's a thing down Andes
upside down why I guess I dad what a
silly little Fred yeah let's go look
outside
fred is wearing a rain jacket and if you
look outside it's pouring rain oh wait
it kind of thought just now but
literally as I walked by like saying
it's raining so hard it has been raining
all day I don't think it's gonna I think
it's taking a tiny break but it's crazy
like how much rain we've been getting
honestly if the weather got just like a
little bit colder we have snow in the
other morning it was actually 30 degrees
out there but there was no like rain or
anything and now obviously it's warmed
up and now it's rain but we're so close
to having snow we are headed out to go
check on with chickens
they gave me one egg yesterday I didn't
get to fog it hello
free you did your job today
not one egg oh man you got me one ate
yesterday that's it
they did get you one yeah one was in
there some either she hasn't laid the
other one yet or they might be just a
little dull like adjusting all right
guys we have the whole family over right
now Brian's actually in the other room
and we are having a peanut butter Wong
party I was supposed to roll him earlier
and I just did not have the energy to do
it
oh well game over start rolling 400
paper balls and I told them they
couldn't leave until 400 peanut butter
balls are old you're crazy
technically the fact is supposed to make
400 but we never really do that we will
end up making them bigger and then we
get like 200 we just have this great
idea because we're just so tired and we
don't want to do that many people rolls
we're gonna make peanut butter like
squares layer of chocolate layered
peanut butter and then a layer of
chocolate on top and then it'll just cut
them up that's not good get your feet
off here that sounds better right okay
