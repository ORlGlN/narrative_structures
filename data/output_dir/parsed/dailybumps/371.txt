sitting down here and getting some work
done because it's been stressing me out
for a couple days now so been working on
that but yeah I did well you guys know
we do have something really really
special and fun coming up we've done it
before but never to this magnitude so
it's going to be it's going to be really
cool but it's like a beautiful day I'm
going to show you this guy because I've
been staring at it outside the window
right now and I just I can't believe how
freaking beautiful it is I just love
that I live in California I can just
step outside and look at this beautiful
sky look at these green hills you guys
give me blue guys not so beautiful at
this pool we are doing a confession but
look what the progress we've made on
this rock wall we're getting there
and I have our own little Disneyland out
here also I just noticed that our cherry
blossom tree which was bright pink not
only days ago is now dark and kind of
ugly look at it's not ugly but all the
leaves turned like brown red and then
these ones started blooming it's crazy
because everything kind of goes in waves
that like what's starting to like blue
mountain stuff so there's even some bees
on these
there's lots of bees on these fats those
are actually really pretty trees though
gotta have lots of green coming in and
check out this by the chicken coop this
is pretty amazing
all of these wild flowers just started
blooming right in front of the chicken
coop how amazing is that you guys feel
pretty should like pick them and like
make up a case like they're not very
tall - yeah so lots of things starting
to bloom here in California again see
how it's going to be time to stop
wearing pants pretty soon that's for
sure
how are you doing things I started out
on we are getting some lunch now ASID
eat
see I've been getting a ton of clothes
done at the house trying to catch up on
a lot of work and now we didn't realize
it and is wonderful it's actually one
o'clock so we're hungry we're going to
get some lunch and then we're going it's
back to work I think you actually have
planned to do something fun with the
boys over later so I'm excited for that
alright guys well we were the ones
blocked when I show them what you have
for lunch yeah you never seen that
before
no it's right yeah okay so tell them
what you have for lunch
I got waiking and shaped anything yeah
oh
and then Trini bets off you got a bitch
boy drinks too huh I'll be the head a
little so you've got a big boy chain
she's quite proud of it yeah
go repress what that situation yeah you
could do that all right just rode out on
the Polaris out here because we have
flour that is a big flower that's cool
comes a little salad
hi Wow
they're all different it looks like it
differently think of it it's like I got
a flower yeah these are cool Wow look
across the street not all the
wildflowers right now now that's really
cool
- is so happy for this flower check this
out you guys these hay bales from
Halloween our sprouted hey hey
here out on a little hike and it's
something I've been wanting to do for a
long time but I haven't felt the
confidence to go out and explore which
is kind of just like I'm back this way
this amazing area there's a couple of
pools over there just like little ponds
of water and it's really pretty out here
I love it so green since after all the
rain tomorrow a little hike and Brian
can come with us some kind of about
cookies dealing with internet issues
we're just going to explore this amazing
area Wow
Oh
can't touch the grass Holly
Oh
right Ollie right you can't donate your
uh just get on the dirt there you go
rusted rough maple
ah okay did you get anything cool didn't
oh it's like I really need you
okay run back - are you exploring - so
the Ranger was very clear that Ollie or
nobody is - well again do you think
nobody is to go off the path or I
basically said don't touch the grass he
said I said are there snakes out he said
yes we got some rattle thing make sure
the kids stay on the path
yeah Ollie took that very seriously
well Wow yeah if we touch the guys and I
think he's been playing like lava like
it's hot lava but he's so cute he's like
trying to like carefully go around the
grass mm-hm
I don't know why I have to walk like
this okay
Holly where are we at the fish this
where you catch the fish I did it a
beautiful day we just made it to our
destination which is oh my gosh Holly
please drop off just like this amazing
pond this is all just rain water yeah
this is usually completely drying if you
look on the map it'd be dry and it
really is probably only like six inches
deep but it looks so cool
so I don't know if there's much fish in
this pond but we are seeing a lot of pad
polls and it's so funny because those
are the tackle divers my childhood just
think for Paliwal Polliwogs yeah tadpole
just like a little tiny frogs and
they're like a date it was fun easier to
talk about how we got to Idaho and we
saw little pollywog titles because unita
ho there like bullfrogs out here there's
like you know tiny babies by maybe
talking effort enough it is like a foot
deep just be really miserable on the
lock box
this is snake-infested water like this
is ridiculous up a third one
at least yeah like hanging out like all
these Janelle ball is so the Vegas
resident water okay I'm pretty sure
they're really harmless snakes they're
real they're not anything dangerous
the only thing changes that we have are
rattle signals and we are very very
round so it's still very appreciative
example snakes like living in the water
really fun to watch so they're pretty
nice so pretty Holly you just want to
catch them then come here you're done
using to go any further
Finley's days you will not go oh my god
thank you my key won't let anyone hold
it I mean Oh actually log it's pretty
crazy
