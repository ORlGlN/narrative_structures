is Missy's birth week she's like
pretty excited yeah miss you know we're
just talking about that this morning how
we can seriously own our own business we
can buy a car we can have children we
can buy a house but we cannot rent cars
you know we can buy alcohol we can buy
cigarettes we can buy lottery tickets we
can buy marijuana just getting you're
not supposed to do that but we couldn't
we still do not have the ability to rent
a car your 325 in the United States to
rent a car and that's kind of sucks it's
not as if you everyone like do something
like go to Florida for playlist live um
we can't rent a car yeah we have to like
use taxis and like drivers and stuff
like that so Missy's getting closer hala
beginner how are you old you gonna be
babe what no you're not you can't she's
already starting to count down like make
it smaller than it actually is
come on how old are you gonna be 24 24
years young that's right you guys I got
myself an older woman it's a ringer this
is going crazy in the kitchen you guys
what are you doing babe yeah yeah we
parently had like a ton of old food what
is it Oh a little avocado I might eat
that no I might eat it still it's
avocado it's nummy what else is in here
a half-hour available off of it I might
eat that Missy and then there's another
one is okay we got one and a half bagels
you guys keep note look at my shade
tober food drawers looking pretty bare
cuz I'm gone shopping in a while ha so
just clean out the fridge and it looks
so much better I hate when that happens
like all are like um like old dinners
and stuff like build up build up and
then it's just like all this food in
there no one wants to throw it away but
yeah no one's going to eat it and
just gets kind of disgusting and gross
to get to clean it out then the other
problem is you never want to clean out
because whoever's dishes and I'll have
to do all those dishes so I always feel
so bad you hate it when I clean the
dishes
all right hand okay goodness oh my
goodness oh this is why you can think up
a duck going by we're reading Oliver his
very first book you can think about day
a day in the day the water is blue and
the birds are awake baby's marvelous
maybe he's gonna be a movie person I
think he does not like like broke out
the toys because Oliver wants to play I
think he's like sorry I know I was like
I want to play too
I kind of been going through them and
like cleaning them up and get em ready
so that Oliver can really start to like
grab at things and play with them hi
dude mmm ah you want to play those too
don't you you think well we're gonna
share right try to figure out which one
you like doesn't you pretty much doesn't
care for any of them there's a pretty
cool ones like we got some pretty cool
toys in here and these are a lot of toys
for such a small baby you got so many
toys you're so spoiled oh I know I know
I know you want to play thank you
Oliver's toys okay okay but I'm just
thinking one the one that's talking I
want that one yeah I'm trying to read
all over a book but the book squeaks so
Carla's really interesting like that's
Martin am I gonna read you your first
book okay this is it eh okay that's a B

I was like gadget circles really cool
when I when I wanna do to me actually he
seems to really like this one it
vibrates when you push it
no you cannot touch this one because
this one will probably already sucking
on it it's like a tea that kind of
course we've got essentially we like
Sophie hmm oh my gosh it's so late it's
not that late but it feels so late we
haven't done like barely anything today
that huge pumpkin Angie that count for
the to pretend probably not actually I
think this is $39.99
oh it's called Big Mac pump mm okay sign
Big Mac comfy that's so funny and it's
weird I don't think it look like a very
nice pumpkin I wouldn't want that but I
bet it's like pumpkin seeds like it's
big
okay you can't like how like a handful
probably you just eat one pumpkin it's
like take bites of the pumpkin seeds
dick guess oh we are going shopping
right now because we need something
which is bring something to eat
something to do which is looking at it

you that big ol smile so our swing ran
out of batteries and he needs to swing
cuz I need to eat some dinner so I've
designated this joj my mom this is the
current state of our bedroom right now
it's pretty um pretty messy disastrous
Missy yeah yeah it's just crazy cuz
we're getting shirts done today and
Ritchie was playing with Ollie with the
toys and the table somehow got over
there how'd that happen and then this is
my desk
currently receipts in what yeah it's
just freaking me out to be honest you
know anything they're dirty and it just
freaks you out oh by the way so all he
really likes his position he like will
cry and cry and cry and then I'll carry
him like this and he'll be all quiet and
happy and I was just thinking if someone
carried me like this
I'd be so pissed I'd be screaming my
head off and it's actually like the one
thing that calms him it turned out the
whales were quite friendly with their
giant tail splashing that scent the
waves flashing they had Oliver laughing
and laughing and laughing Oliver could
have stayed forever but some
we knew he had places to go and things
to do the winds were growing high and
some pirates came by with their peg legs
tattoos high missing teeth and wreck
shoes some were bald some were hairy
every one of them was scary and demanded
hand over your gold
Oliver was small he didn't like them at
all he longed to be tall and mighty but
he dashed out and thrashed out and
altogether lashed out and frightened
those pirates away it was Oliver's mum
who snapped Oliver up it Oliver's dad
who wrapped Oliver up drying Rosie's
cuddly and cozy clean almost done
snuggly and cozy Oliver set sail for
sleep ah you go sleep tank II think I'll
go see ya I read this book to him when
