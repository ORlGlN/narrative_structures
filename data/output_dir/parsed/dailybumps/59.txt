(swooshing sound)
(ice falling)
- Good morning, guys.
We've got just a couple
days 'til Christmas
and we have hardly caught
anything in this Christmas cage.
We caught Buddy the Elf,
we caught Santa BBA.
We did catch mama at some point,
but we were hoping to
catch a couple of few more
magical creatures before
Christmas is over.
So, I have acquired a bucket of ice
and I am gonna attempt
to catch something today
and it may work, and it may not.
But, I guess we'll see.
There's our Christmas cage,
and I am going to set the bait
right underneath it and see if this works.

- Good morning!
-  Good morning,
Ollie! Who is on your sweater?
- Abominable snowman!
-  That's right,
the Abominable Snowman!
-  He's so cool looking! (laughs)
- (roaring)
That is so cool, Ollie.
We are hanging out in
the boys' new bedroom.
If you guys have not seen
the reveal in the tour
I'll have it linked above in the I-card
so you can watch it.
Ollie is so excited, because he's got
the Abominable Snowman on his sweatshirt.
And your next, okay?
- Yeah!
(lighthearted music)
-  Where's Finn?! Where's Finn?!
-  Where's Finny? There he is!
 You got the Abominable
Snowman on yours too.
-  Oh look, and you have ears.
-  Yeah!
-  (roars)
(roars)
- (roars)
- We are hanging out right now
and we have been looking
for Fred all morning.
We haven't found Fred, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
-  I wonder where he is.
Sometimes this guy,
he makes it so hard for
us to find him, huh?
But I did want to take the boys around
and show them that, there is only
three days 'til Christmas. That is wrong.
We're gonna change it
right now. Here we go.
Three days, boys.
That means we have like 72
hours 'til Christmas guys.
-  Do we?
-  Yeah. That's not a lot.
I really hope all of you
have gotten your Christmas shopping done.
We are all done with our
Christmas shopping, huh?
We got our presents
that we wanna give them.
We just have like a little
bit more wrapping to do even.
But, yes guys. Three days 'til Christmas.
And I gotta say,
I'm actually kind of impressed
with myself this year.
Some years, I'm going out on Christmas Eve
to finish my Christmas shopping.
Ahh! It's so crazy to see that number.
Three! Three days!
Only three more sleeps
'til it's Christmas and Santa comes
and brings us presents.
- Did we put the bait down?
-  We sure did. Come check it out.
 What do you think
we'll catch with this ice?
Probably something cold, right?
Maybe like a penguin?
- No, maybe an Abominable
Snowman like this.
-  Maybe.
I don't know if that's
gonna happen though.
Maybe a Narwhal.
-  No.
-  Maybe we'll catch a Narwhal
 You want to catch this?
- Yeah.
This is going to be a
nice Abominable Snowman.
-  Alright, well
let's see if we catch him.
We got our ice under the cage.
(laughs) Shake it up.
- I'm coming for you snowman.
(mischievous music)
(cage slams)
(jingle bells cling)
- So, yeah. Today--
Oh, did you guys hear that?
Did you guys hear that?
Boys did you hear that?!
-  What?
-  We caught something.
I think we caught something
in the Christmas cage!
- (screams)
-  What is it?
- Abominable Snowman!
-  Oh my god.
-  We caught the
Abominable Snowman?!
Oh my goodness. Look at his hands.
Ollie, come here. Come here. Look at him.
Hi, Abominable Snowman.
Are you a nice snowman?
- I'm sorry guys. I'm really sorry.
I just, I smelled the ice and
there's no ice in California.
I just really wanted some ice. Okay?
-  That's okay. I mean,
we kinda wanted to catch you.
-  Would you let me out?
- Yeah we'll let you out.
-  Should we let him out?
-  Yeah.
-  Alright you guys, I think
the Abominable Snowman is good.
We're gonna let him out of the cage.
And we will free the Abominable Snowman!
-  You're free.
-  I can keep this, right?
-  You can have the ice, yes.
You can have the ice.
 Ollie, look at his feet.
Come touch his feet, they're huge.
-  (screams)
-  Those are
some big feet you have.
-  (laughs)
What do you think about that, Ollie?
The Abominable Snowman
in your house? (laughs)
-  (screams)
-  He's not sure about that.
-  Hey, Abominable Snowman!
Come check out my room!
- I'm sure the Abominable
Snowman is very busy
and he has to be going on his way.
- Yeah, I think I'm gonna
go outside actually.
-  Oh, do you want to go outside?
-  Yeah.
-  Let's go outside.
- It's really hot out there
though. It's California.
I think I actually wanted to
make some snow for you guys.
-  What?! Do you
guys wanna make snow?
- Yeah!
-  Finn, do you
wanna play in the snow?
- Yeah.
-  That would be so cool, Snowman.
You can really do that?
-  Yeah, just follow me.
- He just, like, has magical powers.
He can make snow whenever he wants?
- Wow, this is gonna be crazy.
 Okay, we got put
all your shoes and socks on.
-  Alright, I
found some sleds boys.
Do you wanna go sledding maybe?
-  Yeah!
-  That would be cool.
Finn, there's a green one
over there. You want that one?
-  Pull it like this.
-  (laughs) He's
like, no I want to get in it.
 (howls)
Alright, we are following the
Abominable Snowman out here.
He says he gonna make some snow?
(enchanted music)
(twinkling sounds)
(magical sounds)
(cheery music)
- Whoa, real snow!
-  There's snow?! What?
You guys, there's actually
snow in California?!
Whoa! We got our own snow hill, dude.
Jump in it. Is it real snow?
Oh, your-- (laughs)
His shoe came off already.
That's so cool.
(screams)
(laughs)
Wow, you guys. It is soft, real snow.
That's amazing!
Alright, Abominable Snowman
can you show us how it's done?
Oh, my gosh! Look what's
over here, you guys.
 Ollie, Finn! Who is that?
- Fred!
-  Mimi look, it's Fred!
- What is Fred doing?
-  What do you think he's doing?
-  I think he's--
-  He's sledding.
-  (gasps) Guys!
-  Whoa! Look, we got some,
We got some snow toys.
And Abominable Snowman is
gonna test out the hill.
-  (cheers)
-  Whoa!
Oh, look at this Fireball, Ollie.
Do you want to go on the fireball?
-  Yeah.
-  Alright, we got these two.
Ollie's gonna jump in this one,
Finn's gonna jump in this one.
And, go!
(howls)
(laughs) Finn won!
Huge thanks to the Abominable Snowman
for making snow in our
backyard, here in California.
We are now going to hit the slopes
and have some fun in the cold.
(screams) He almost got you.
(upbeat holiday music)
 Whoo-hoo! (laughs)
He is flying.
This is so cool, that Yeti
came and gave us snow,
and now we have an actual Yeti blow up.
-  I know.
-  Alright, Poppa. You going?
- One, two, three!
-  Oh, he almost fell off.
(upbeat music)
 Three, two, one, go! (howls)
(upbeat music)
 What do your doggies
think of the snow, Carma?
Do you remember that?
(upbeat music)
 Ollie, what do
you think about the snow?
It's like real snow, huh?
- I can't build a snow man.
-  Oh, I'm sure you can--
Oh my gosh, watch out!
You want to build a snow man, Ollie?
- Yeah.
-  Alright, we are going to attempt
building a snow man.
What do you think, Poppa?
-  Oh my gosh, it's so
cold and icy. It's just ice.
-  Uncle! Where have you been?
- Uh.
-  Do you see the snow?
- It's pretty cool, yeah.
-  There's a bunch
of snow in our yard.
But it had nothing to do
with you though, right?
- I was upstairs.
-  You were reading probably?
- Yeah, reading.
-  Yeah.
We're trying to build a snowman.
Be very careful, Ollie.
- Californians do not have
the right gear for this.
- Alright, the fun has really begun.
We have invited friends
and family to come over
to the sledding hill and tear it up a bit.
 And here goes Aunt Linda!
-  Whoo!
-  Whoo! Almost ran into CJ.
(cheerful music)
So, June just experienced a
sledding miracle in California.
Didn't you? (laughs)
- Did you like the snow?
She's like straight faced.
-  Kelsey and Corbin
brought June over to the sledding hill.
Be sure to check out them in the I-Card
and you can watch it right now.
We thought we would give you guys
some Christmas presents.
- Aw.
-  And we have a really cool one
we want to give you guys for June.
Alright, help mama.
- It's a new dog!
-  Laughs.
- I'm holding it's mouth
so it doesn't bark.
-  Here you go,
June. Merry Christmas.
Do you want to see? (whooshing sound)
-  Whoa!
-  Down here, it's right here.
-  Look at that.
-  It's so fluffy.
- It's so fluffy. It's
like a fluffy Paris.
-  That's so cute.
-  It looks just like Paris.
-  Finn will show her how it works.
He's a little crazy on it.
But Finn always has loved these rockers
so, I was like, oh we
gotta get one for June,
and that one's so cute.
-  Okay, here we go. Saddle up.
-  Oh my goodness, look at you!
(laughs)
- Yeah!
Oh, that's so cool
- Yeah.
-  Merry Christmas, Junebug.
-  Say, thank you.
Look, she's smiling.
- We had such a fun day
hanging out in the snow with Yeti.
Didn't we boys?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that was a fun day.
Check out the sweater I'm wearing.
I got the Belsnickel sweatshirt.
Impish or Admiral?
If you guys don't watch The Office,
it's basically one of Dwight's characters.
It is so comfy, I'm just wrapped up in it
walking around the house.
Missy is dipping some peanut butter balls.
- Back at it.
-  Back at it.
Getting some sweets going.

surprises this weekend.

Look at this crazy cloud in the sky.
We just got a ton of text messages
saying to look up at this cloud.
Look at that. What is that?
It's so bright.
-  It's shining
on the perfect angle.
-  I don't know.
That gives me goosebumps.
That's crazy.
-  I don't know if I got goosebumps
or if I'm just freezing.
-  I know, right. (laughs)
Wow, that is crazy.
