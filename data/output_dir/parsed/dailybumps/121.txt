- It is Finn's birthday!
(Missy cheers)
- That was so sad.
He's always so happy to be there,
he always gives me a hug and a kiss,
and then he's off playing with
his friends, and it's always so cute.
But this time, he was crying.
- You have a decision to make, right here,
on the first day of being
two years old, okay?
Are you gonna be terrible, or are
you gonna be a good two year old?
♫ This is our life, this is our fun
♫ This is who we are, this is our dream
♫ This is our team, shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
- Cheese!
Good morning!
-  What are we doing?
- Going to school!
-  Yay, are you excited?
- Yeah.
- Yep, it's another day, and that means
it is school time, and we're excited!
Are you excited to see your
teacher, and all your friends?
He only goes to school two days a week.
On those days, he is very excited.
He usually misses all his friends
and teachers so much, huh?
Alright, let's head to school.
That was so sad.
I have always dropped off Ollie,
and he's always so happy to be there,
he always gives me a hug and a kiss,
and then he's off playing with
his friends, and it's always so cute.
But this time, he was crying
and he was so sad, and
it's so weird, because literally
going into the classroom,
he was like, oh I'm so
excited to see my teacher,
and then I dropped him off and
he was just clinging to me,
was like, I don't want you to
leave, and he started crying.
And it was so sad.
He's never ever like that,
so I don't know if something
is going on in his classroom,
that he hasn't told us.
And then maybe he forgot, and then
he got there, then he just realized it.
But he said his teacher and
it's never really like that,
and that he did cry last Thursday
when my Dad dropped him off,
because he didn't hear my Dad say bye.
So maybe he just kind of
remembered that feeling?
I'm not really sure, but it kind of sad.
I felt really bad, but I
think Payton just got there,
and Payton's always like his best friend,
and I think he'll be happy to see her,
and they can kind of hang out together,
and it will feel like home I guess.
- So today is a special day,
if you guys do not know,
it is Finn's birthday!
(Missy cheering)
He's two babe!
- He's two; he's officially two!
- Officially, it is
terribly two's, huh Finn?
-  Uh huh.
- Uh huh.
- Are you gonna be terrible?
So this one it's two!
- Two!
- Take that one!
- We're still teaching him
how to hold up two fingers.
Yes, that's right, you're two years old.
And what are you.
What's in your mouth right now?
-  Gum.
- You're chewing on gum?
You're not old enough to chew on gum!
I love you so much buddy!
This kid has so much
life and love to give,
and he just loves exploring and playing
and I just love the little
boy that he's turning into.
It's so cute, huh!
-  Cute.
-  Oh look at this,
adventurous right there.
-  He has birthday
presents to open.
-  You got some
birthday presents to open?
- Ah!
- I know, I see you chewing
gum; terrible twos have begun.
The terrible twos, do
you guys remember that,
with Ollie?
- Yeah, with Ollie.
- There were some definite moments,
when Ollie was two years
old, I was like, wow!
- Yeah.
-  They do not
prepare you for this.
-  He is already, definitely--
- He's definitely feisty, huh?
Are you feisty?
You have a decision to make, right here,
on the first day of being
two years old, okay.
Are you gonna be terrible, or are
you gonna be a good two year old?
- Um, ba ah ah!
- He has so much to say right now.
He's telling you guys a story right now.
-  Are you gonna
be terrible, or good.
- Good.
- Good?
- Good!
- Good.
(Missy cheering)
- Alright, we're gonna hold
you to that birthday boy!
(laughing)
So today, on Twitter, we
asked you guys to share
some of your favorite moments
from Finn, on the vlog,
with the #happybirthdayfinn.
We got so many good ones,
and I have a feeling
we're about to get
emotional right now, but,
before you guys watch
this awesome montage,
leave in the comments below,
what is your favorite moment of Finn,
and be sure to wish him
a very happy birthday.
Shall we run the montage?
-  Say hit it!
- Hit it!
(laughter)
(somber music)
-  Uh oh you
guys, the terrible twos
have officially begun!
Finn is screaming crying, because
he wants a Batman cupcake.
You really want one?
- Yes!
-  And it has to be Batman?
- Yes.
-  Okay, happy birthday!
I love you.
- Dah dah.
-  What do you say?
Say thank you.
- Thank you dada.
- His speech is getting so much clearer,
like he just said thank you dada.
That's so cute, but yes, I do fear
that the terrible twos
have begun with Finn.
It was a little crazy with
Ollie, and I have a feeling
it's gonna be the same with him too.
So, it's gonna be a fun year, honestly.
Can you get it?
- I took this off, and he's really mad.
Do you want me to take it off?
- No!
- Okay, you do it!
(Finn crying)
He's trying to stick it back on.
-  You have to
take it off to eat it bro!
Do you see how conflicted he is?
- Now we have to give him a new one.
-  It is soiled.
(rhythmic music)
- Look what came you guys!
I got samples of the
brand-new Tribe shirts.
Look at this all over color print.
I love it, and it's got
the Tribe logo on it.
And then we also have them in youth sizes,
and I believe onesies, as
well, just with the Tribe logo.
We weren't able to do the whole color
all over the youth sizes, but
the adult ones look amazing.
Look at that you guys, that's so cool.
So if you guys want to nab
yourself a Tribe shirt,
head on over to dailybumpsmerch.com.
Check out what we got,
we got some cool stuff there for you guys.
-  What's up dude?
-  Oh my goodness!
-  How are you?
-  Hi, I'm the aunt.
- So me and my Dad just ran into
a thrift store, and we
got a bunch of goodies,
for our haunted maze that we're doing
for our Halloween party,
and I'm so excited.
And look what I had to
buy, about 40 VHS's.
I guess you're gonna have to find out
later what this is for, but
I am super excited about it.
It was actually kind of
funny, and I don't know why,
what the lady was thinking
when I was buying 40 of these,
but she was like you're about to have
a really cool movie night.
I tried to buy as many
dumb movies as possible.
Sometimes you just have to get a good one,
like Liar, Liar! (laughing)
No, there are some good ones in here too.
- We may rescue a couple.
- Yeah.
- Maybe have a few rescues in there.
- Maybe, maybe.
- What's up dude?
How was school?
- Good.
- Good, you eatin' one of the cupcakes
from Finn's superhero birthday party?
- Mm-hmm.
- How's it taste?
- Good.
- Good?
How was school,
- Good.
good, did you take a nap?
- No.
- No, you didn't take a nap today?
- Mm-mm.
- Alright, but you had fun?
- Mm-hmm.
- What'd you learn about?
- The letter U.
- U, oh that's so cool!
Like umbrella?
- Mm-hmm.
- And unicorn?
- And underpants!
(laughing)
- So Finn got this birthday card
at his birthday party, from the Johnson's,
and I don't know if he's seen it yet.
Hang on.
♫ To the right, to the right,
to the right, to the right
Look at these farm
animals, they're dancing!
(laughter)
- Is that cute?
Ollie picked this card out for you.
Do you want to open this one?
- This is from me.
-  Yep, Ollie picked
this card out just for you Finn.
Oh, look at him opening it, that's cute.
(Bryan laughs)
- Da thank you!
(laughter)
- Da thank you!
-  What'd you get
Finn, what'd you get?
Who is it?
Ollie, he loves it!
- Birthday hugs to you,
let's see what it says.
Mickey Mouse has come to play,
and have some fun with you today.
And something else he's coming to do,
is bring a birthday hug for you.
-  Ah, so you've got
to give him a big hug Ollie!
- Happy birthday, Finn.
- You want me to take this off for you?
- It's so cool, Ollie,
picked this out, all himself,
and it's a card that
has a little bracelet,
that he can wear, and then it
plays the Hot Diggity Dog song.
I was like, that's so cool!
And those dancing animals, huh?
Ah, that's so cool.
All these crazy cards now
days, I think it's so funny.
Look it, he can't even
focus, he's so loving this.
Ollie, you did a good job dude!
- Hey, is that a bracelet?
- Yeah, he wears it and it
plays the music from the card?
-  Look at momma's.
-  Oh, you guys are matching!
-  Look at this!
-  Hey Finn, guess what!
We have more presents; you
wanna open some more presents?
There they are!
-  You want to open it?
-  Yes, Finn is
obsessed with Batman,
so they're all wrapped in Batman.
Here you go buddy, do you want to open it?
There you go; what is it, Finn what is it?
He needs his music, so he can
dance and unwrap his present.
Are you kidding me right now?
Karma's gonna help, Karma's gonna help.
Grab this right here, there you go.
-  Ollie, you want to help too?
-  Go ahead.
How many humans and animals
does it take to open a birthday present?
Whoa, Finn look!
It's Cars Thunder Hollow, that's so cool!
We got another one; this is from Ollie.
Who is it?
-  What is it?
Batman!
-  Whoa, Finn, punch
him, punch him in the chest.
Hard!
(toy growls)
(laughing) Isn't that so funny, Finn.
- I think he's done with it.
- He's like yay, a toy I
can actually wrestle with.
Go for it Finn, open him up, open him up.
What do you see, what do you see?
What do you see, what do you see?
Whoa!
- Cars!
-  More cars,
from the Cars 3 movie.
That's so cool, and a
storage case for them all.
-  Yay.
- Aha, the boys love the new Cars 3 movie.
Finn was watching it this morning.
Ollie was watching it this morning.
It like just came out.
What'd you get, what'd you get?
Let me see!
Whoa, that's so cool!
What'd you get Ollie?
- Mater!
- Ah, cool!
That's gonna be so fun for them.
They love cars and racing and stuff.
It's so cute.
- Yay!
-  Happy birthday
Finn, I love you buddy.
- We love you so much,
huh, can I have a kiss?
(upbeat music)
- Alright, we've got the whole fam,
and we, well besides Kathy, auntie,
we are are headed into a
super fun pumpkin patch.
It's a lot different
than the pumpkin patch
that we went to the other day.
It's more of like a bouncy house, fun one,
and the boys are so excited, huh Finney?
I told Bryan, we have to
go to this pumpkin patch,
because this is the one we've
been taking the boys to,
and they always have a picture
called How Tall This Fall.
It's so cute, I love it, I love.
We took Finn when he
was just a few days old,
for the How Tall This Fall
picture, and now he's two.
(lighthearted guitar music)
- So we're at Hunter's Pumpkin patch.
We come here every year, and every year
they have the coolest blow-up jumpers.
Look at this giant crocodile one.
Ollie, have you ever seen a huge
crocodile, bigger than our house?
- No.
-  Well look at this.
Isn't that crazy?
- Can you jump in it?
-  I don't know.
That's a huge gator though, huh?
- Yeah, he's got sharp teeth.
-  Yeah, he's got some sharp teeth.
Look it, he keeps him clean too, huh.
- Yeah.
-  Do you think
he brushes his teeth?
- No.
-  No? (laughs)
Nice!
How tall this fall.
-  Whoa.
-  Wow Ollie, you're
almost six feet tall!
How bout you Finn?
- Am I a bird?
-  You're a scarecrow! (laughs)
- A scarecrow?
-  Yeah, now Finn's a scarecrow.
-  Alright, Finn is
about to do the obstacle course.
Go Finn go, go Finn go!
He's gotta climb up the ladder.
Go Finn go!
Up the ladder, down the slide.
Come on Finn, woohoo!
Where is he?
Finn, where are, there he
is, he's coming through!
You did it!
Do you wanna go again?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, one more time.
-  Look at this big
kid we have now you guys!
He's doing so good.
-  Watch where you're going!
-  Whoa!
You're so good dude!
- And that's a wrap!
The boys are in bed, we had
such a fun day, it was so good.
Finn is absolutely in love with
his cars, and he hasn't even opened
the main part of it.
- The main one.
I bet they would love Hot Wheels.
- Oh yeah.
- They're really cool, I was always
into Hot Wheels growing up too.
- So was I!
- Really?
- Yeah, we always had to get
Hot Wheels when we were kids.
- Yeah.
- They are gonna be so excited,
well especially Finn, but even Ollie,
is gonna be so excited when
we put it all together.
Then they can actually race and stuff.
The kids are in bed, so
I think we're gonna go
ahead and--
- They got a good workout at
that pumpkin patch.
They both went to bed.
- Yeah, they were exhausted. (laughing)
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.
Make sure you give it a
big thumbs up if you did,
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Bye!
- Bye!
(soft fun music)
