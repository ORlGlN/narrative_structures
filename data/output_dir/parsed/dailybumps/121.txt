-  What'd you guys find?
- A frog!
-  Aww!
- Be very gentle.
Don't point him at me!
-  That is such a cool one!
(giggling)
It's crawling up Papa!
(children laughing excitedly)
- Slow down, slow, gentle with him.
You don't scare him.
- Grab him.
Good job Ollie!
(laughing)
- Oh, he was jumping on you!
♪ This is our life ♪
♪ Let's live it ♪
♪ Live it forever ♪
- Good Morning!
Batman!
Oh my!
Jeez, what just happened?
- Batman mean.
- Batman's mean?
Morning guys, I'm just hanging
out with Finn right now,
and Ollie's at school.
We need to pick him up soon.
You miss Ollie?
- Batman?
- You wanna be Batman or
you want Mama to be Batman?
Batman!
(screams)
Don't attack me!
What are you, the Joker?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Hey bud, we gotta get you dressed, okay?
I've got your pants, and your shirt,
and it's time to get dressed, okay?
We had such a fun night
yesterday, it was Friendsgiving.
We had a lot of friends
over, we had a yummy dinner.
We just played some games
and had a really, really fun night.
So now it's back to reality.
Yesterday the whole day was just kind
of all about the party,
and cooking and baking.
Definitely was like a little pre-gamer
for next week, which is Thanksgiving.
Now it is back to life and
I gotta go get him ready,
and I gotta go get Ollie today.
And we have a few more things to do.
And he's dressed!
Are you being a crazy boy today?
Do you miss your brother, Ollie?
- No, no, no!
(laughing)
- All right.
Let's go baby.
Karma, what have you been doing all day?
Have you been looking for your friend?
Where's Luna?
He's like "Where is she?"
You guys, this morning we
had to say goodbye to Luna.
Where's Luna, Finn?
- Luna (babbling).
- Oh yeah?
Luna actually had a
spay appointment today,
and so she had to go early this morning
to the doctor's to get
spayed, and I feel so bad.
She's been such a good
dog, and I feel like she's
gonna be like, "What the heck,
did I do something wrong?".
'Cause she just goes
there to get surgery done.
She's getting spayed, which I think
was really, really important for her,
but she's also getting a microchip.
Yay, although I will say this.
I feel like everyone also
thinks that a microchip
is so that you can track them
wherever they are, it's not.
It's that if they find her,
and they take her somewhere
where they can scan it, then
they can see her address
or her contact information.
But it's still a really awesome thing,
and I'm really glad that
she's gonna have that now.
That's just a little bit more of security.
We've also taken a lot
of different actions
and we actually finally found a piece
that goes on her collar, so
that we can actually track her,
and see where she's at at different times.
It's hard because we kind
of in like a rural area,
and so it's hard to find
ones that work in this area.
But I think we might
have finally found one.
But anyways, we are headed
off today to do a few things,
and then we gotta go pick up Luna.
Ollie, how was school?
Good?
Were you sleeping in class?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Ollie, your hair is all messed up.
You have bed head!
Isn't that funny?
(laughs)
All right, I'm glad
your home, I missed you.
All right, we are headed to go get Luna!
Did you know Luna was gone today?
- No.
- No, you didn't know.
He didn't know that we took her.
So she had a little operation,
she went to the doctors.
So she's gonna be a little groggy,
and a little slow today.
So we'll have to be really gentle
and take really good care of her, okay?
- Okay.
- Finn, sound good?
You still with mommy's babysitter?
(laughs)
All right, I'm gonna go get Luna.
My mom's here so she can
- Watch the kids.
- watch the boys,
while I go in and get her.
I hope she's okay, I hope she's not sad.
Oh by the way mom, Karma has
been looking for her all day.
- Really?
- Yes!
I would go, "Where's Luna?",
and he would look around the house.
And then he runs off and
then he even cries sometimes
when he runs off, like "Where is she?".
- That's cute.
-  Ollie, are
you excited to get Luna?
Yeah, are you gonna take care of her?
Maybe you can be her doctor,
give her lots of hugs and kisses?
- I don't know how to be a doctor.
-  You're right.
Okay, then you can just be Ollie
and just give her lots of love, okay?
Here she comes!
There she is!
Hi, girlie.
-  She's still a little drowsy.
- Aww, are you okay?
You wanna give her some hugs?
She just got a little owie
on her tummy but she's okay.
All right, come on girl.
She's so out of it.
-  Hi pretty girl, come on.
There you go.
-  Good job Luna.
(light banjo music)
Karma, your friend is here!
Be gentle!
She's like "What did
they do to me, Karma?".
Karma you've done it too, you
can tell her all about it.
Aww, she's so happy to see you.
- I missed her honestly.
I dropped her off today, this morning,
and she was so scared
and she didn't know what was happening.
And then she just got home.
-  Yeah, and she saw you,
and started wagging her little nub.
(laughs) She was so happy to see him.
- You okay, girl?
- You got your guy?
(light banjo music)
-  I have here in my hands
the first official Daily
Bumps 2018 calender.
Look at that babe.
- This is so cool.
-  It's so much
nicer than I thought.
It's super nice quality and
the color looks so good.
- It's so creative.
Like there's so, it's just I love it
because I feel like every
picture is so different.
-  Yeah, and we've
worked so hard so this.
- It's so vibrant and life to it.
I love pictures that
have movement in them,
and you can see something
happening in them.
And that's almost every
single one of them.
-  Yeah, totally.
I thought I would give you
guys a really quick sneak peak
because we really can't
give away too much.
- I know, it's so good though.
- But we're gonna show you
guys the very first month
of the Daily Bumps calender, okay?
There's the intro page, which is cute.
You ready, you ready for it?
You ready for it?
Boom.
- January.
In January we eat
breakfast in bed everyday.
-  Apparently, yes.
Look that is the very
first picture of the month.
We're not gonna give away anything else.
Yeah, that was such a fun
shoot in the bed like that.
- It has your birthday on it.
- Yes, it's full of
special dates and reminders
throughout the whole year.
If you guys have not
ordered your calender,
go order one right now.
Link is down below, in the description.
We are signing a very
limited amount of these
and we're gonna get the kids in on it too.
Just really proud of this.
We worked really hard
on this, it was cool.
- Yeah, this was a lot of
work, but it was so worth it.
And I will say, that you better believe,
that every one of my family
members is getting one
of these for Christmas.
- Totally!
Christmas present, we have it!
- All my cousins, like, oh,
I've got my daily calender.
- I think it's cool and
the boys are so cute too.
So yes, link down below
in the description.
Go get your calender!
Look what we have, Ollie!
It's our calender!
-  Isn't that cool?
- Wait, that's our cereal!
-  That's cereal.
-  That's us in bed, huh?
- Pancakes!
- Pancakes!
-  Yeah, isn't that cool, Ollie?
It's our first calender.
- Hey guys, we should go swimming.
- You wanna go swimming?
- You wanna do the polar plunge again?
- Just go swimming.
- If you guys didn't see yesterday's vlog,
Ollie jumped in a freezing
cold swimming pool, didn't you?
That was crazy.
- How cold was it, Ollie?
- Yeah, how cold was it?
- Really cold!
(Missy laughing)
-  There you have
it, you heard it first.
-  All right, showing
my parents the calender.
- It's so pretty!
-  So cute, right?
You're getting one for Christmas.
-  Yeah, you guys are putting that
in your bedroom, right?
Or your kitchen?
- Well, yeah.
- Hallway, both?
- All over the house.
-  Every room will have a calender.
- It's so cute, look at that.
- The colors are amazing,
they're so vibrant.
These are the cutest people ever.
- You managed to work a
chicken in to it, huh?
You managed to work a chicken in?
-  Our chickens are there.
-  And my cactus.
(laughing)
- Oh, look at that!
- Isn't that cool?
- Wow!
- Is that you?
-  Okay you gotta keep it like this
so they won't see it.
- All right, it's a surprise.
-  What do you think of that one?
- That's so cute.
- Is that you?
Who's that?
- Dada!
- Yeah, who's that?
- Mama!
- Who's that?
- Chick.
- Chickens!
Now you guys know there's a chicken.
-  Yeah!
What'd you guys find?
- A frog!
-  Be very gentle.
-  What, are you scared, Finn?
Oh my goodness!
Are you gonna hold it?
- No, no, no!
- He'll jump right in your
face if you're not careful!
-  I know!
- Don't point him at me!
(laughing)
(dog barking)
-  That is such a cool one.
(laughing)
(yelling excitedly)
Finn, Finn hold it!
It's crawling up Papa!
- Slow down, slow, gentle with him.
Don't scare him.
-  Grab him, good job.
- Oh!
(laughing)
He was jumping on you!
He gave you kisses!
(Missy laughing)
- I'm not gonna hold that!
I'm gonna run away!
- You kissed a frog!
He looks kind of like a tree frog.
-  Wow, he's a jumper.
- He is.
(screams in surprise)
(laughing)
Don't point him at me!
(boys laughing)
-  Oh gosh, I'm pretty
sure you kissed the frog.
Did it kiss you?
Finn, can you pet him?
- No.
-  Can you give him a little pet?
(screams)
- It scared him.
-  Is that a tree frog?
-  Yeah.
- Oh, it's a tree frog.
(screams)
He almost got me!
-  Look at him crawling up.
-  He's climbing,
he's climbing, he's climbing!
-  He is climbing, huh?
He's like Spiderman.
Show it to daddy.
Grab it.
-  That's a big frog.
-  That's a tree frog.
- Aw, look at how cute he is.
Oh my gosh, look at that!
Why is he wet, is he peeing on me?
- No!
- No, he already peed.
(laughing)
Earlier today.
- He's so cute.
- Aww, I know!
I wanna take a picture.
- You want him on your spoon?
- Oh no, don't eat him!
- I'm not gonna eat him!
-  All right, don't eat him.
(laughing)
- Stop!
- Just kidding.
- You're so funny, Ollie.
Oh my gosh.
-  He's gonna
jump right in your mouth man.
Slow down!
- He's like oh I don't want
him to jump in my mouth.
- I do not want that to happen.
- Let's put him up on the.
- Look he can sit right there.
-  In his own trees.
-  He's like,
"These are the driest trees
"I've ever touched."
- What a cool looking frog.
- Yeah, he's really cool.
-  Oh, that was quite a jump!
Wow, he really does jump.
(upbeat music)
- All right guys, something just happened.
Finn has been saying
he needs to go poo poo,
and so I figured he did go poop,
but I just checked, and he hadn't.
And so Ollie is trying to
show him the big boy potty.
You gonna go check it out, Finn?
-  Hey Finn, let me show you.
-  Go turn the light on.
- Like that.
- Oh that's how you sit on it?
Turn the light on so he's not scared.
All right, show him how to sit on it.
So basically you put that down,
the little seat, and then you just sit.
You think you can do that?
- Yeah.
-  You can do that Finn, go ahead.
- Go ahead.
- Just go, just go!
- I'll help you.
All done!
- Mama's trying, you wanna try?
-  You wanna try?
- No.
- It's so comfy, are you sure?
- He's tried it a couple
times, he sits on it.
Oh is that what you do?
- (laughs) Yeah!
- All right, kids are finally asleep.
Usually bedtime is not a big deal at all,
but both kids were just
not feeling it tonight.
- I laid Ollie down, and he
put his arms around my neck,
so I was laying him
down, and I just let go
and came back up and he
was still attached to me.
I was like, okay.
(laughs)
- Yeah, it's really not usually that hard,
but they were just not gonna sleep tonight
and so Finn was super tough
and Ollie was really hard
and I don't know, I guess it
was just one of those days.
- I feel like it's mostly school days
when Ollie doesn't see me a lot.
-  Yeah.
- At night he just clings to me.
- It could be that, he
also did nap at school
which I think he never naps,
so when he naps at
school you better believe
he's probably not gonna want
to sleep at night, at bedtime.
And Finn, actually, didn't
sleep well the night before,
but he took a two hour nap today.
So I think he also, I think
we just both were like,
"Oh cool, they both got naps,"
but now they're not gonna sleep.
So kind of a bummer, but
they're finally asleep.
We win, we always win boys.
I don't know why you fight us.
But yeah, we are so ready
to just relax for the night
and just watch some T.V.
We're actually hanging
out in Bryan's office.
Luna is chilling right over there.
She's not even gonna poke her head up.
She's so out of it.
I feel so bad for her.
She's still just totally
loopy and kind of just like
"What's going on", so I feel so bad.
But hopefully she starts
to feel better by tomorrow.
But anyways, I hope you
guys enjoyed today's video
and don't forget to get
one of these calendars.
- Get yourself a calendar
before they're gone.
- Aren't they so cute?
Make sure you give this
video a big thumbs up
if you enjoyed it and we'll
see you guys tomorrow.
Bye, boop.
(upbeat bright music)
