just America good morning Ari are we all
dressed up we got our hair all dead what
are we doing today to know why we
filming something really cool
yesterday nifty doesn't smell something
really cool and now all of us get stoned
something really cool right yeah we
actually have a whole film tree at our
house today setting up we're going to be
filming something really funny I think
that the kids are really going to enjoy
you can enjoy what do you get to do in
the video oh and right now is that
breeze outside our door and Holly has
potential right yeah I'm getting all her
letters for the shoot Missy actually
took Fidan to meet hospital today he was
having some problems breathing last
night he was wheezing very short of
breath and it's things that we've dealt
with before but it got really really bad
last night so Miffy took us to the
hospital today and they're actually
doing chest x-rays hoping that
everything is good so bad for the little
guy because it cannot be very fun and if
something's wrong then we kinda have to
cancel our whole day because he's poor
at that point so we need to hear back
from them to see how he is and hoping
that they show up but right now we have
a full crew here so all in our just make
the most of it and see if we get
something done okay well good get the
burger get them oh powerchute I was at
your power shield you have a lot of
energy right now don't ya yeah very
cutely Jeffrey's Bay
the subject you get to relax today huh
you got your shades on you got to keep
them on to protect your eyes what are
you drinking Gatorade yeah my daddy
wearing this funny outfit I know right
thank you having fun okay are we doing
something hey hey guys hey come whining
how you feeling bud
oh you hug yeah we just got back to my
dog Oh last night was really rough this
is bad I slept next to his bed he was
definitely having some a hard time
breathing but if he was breathing it was
just like a nose somewhat difficult his
fever spiked pretty high at one point so
I had to give him medicine which had
been lower they just said to get him I
couldn't the morning so I did and after
doing an x-ray they were able to see
that he has the beginning of pneumonia
which is a really scary word especially
for a mom to hear but basically what
happened is he had bronchiolitis which
is sort of what he gets every once in a
while it definitely traveled he'll get
like a regular cold it just travels to
his chest like really easily but then
what happened is pneumonia just kind of
built up in there they said that it's
just like right at the beginning stages
in that they gave him a shot of
antibiotic so he's kind of breathing
Truman today and I shot him in a biotic
and I feel like he's already seems a lot
better has more energy now that could
just be because he's like ready to have
more energy and he's just tired of
laying around I don't know if it's
necessarily from the shot of antibiotics
but I feel like he's starting to look a
little bit better and the thing is
somehow with 18 month olds is even if
they're sick they don't want to just lay
in that like I want him to lay in bed
and cuddle next to me and not move but
he just is determined to move so I've
got by the way that's like a total mess
but he's happy right now which is good a
little cleaning but that is to be
expected
yeah but he's actually doing
pretty good so we're just have to keep
up with his breathing treatments
functioning is no no's and then and
we're going to follow up tomorrow I'm
sure Brian told you we have one filming
crew here and I was getting ready to
tell them go home I can't do this but
he's doing ok so I think he's not in
anything so we're just going to make
sure he's happy in content I don't know
what he's going through right now but
and then all the street a couple four
Clips yeah it's just hard an ammonia
such a scary word I like until I was
like that's really scary like is he okay
like you think I'm going to end up in
the emergency room and she said it's
just really hard to know but just to
watch him really closely so that is what
we're doing
ah yeah hey hey wow wow oh wow wow wow
all right you guys we've had such a busy
day filming something super funny we
were able to film everything that we
needed to do at our house but
unfortunately then really couldn't be in
much most of it because he's not feeling
well he's actually taking an amazing nap
right now which is really really good
for him obviously the best thing you can
do when you're sick is nap but he's a
kid he just wants to run around and play
but we got him to take a nap we were
able to film everything and then we just
have a little shoot tomorrow on location
networking me doing yeah fun productive
day Olly what are you doing
did I just catch you red-handed no only
on the wall yeah we're being responsible
parents and letting him only color on
the wall what are you drawing over there
Holly can you draw Maui's fishhook
pretty close yeah pretty close you want
me to do this one I can I have your
permission look at that I did a smiley
face that's pretty cool right
Oh
pretty close here run a color inside the
circle good job yes all he has made
quite a mess and all of this will make
sense very shortly it's actually part of
the video we did where he's coloring on
the wall like a crazy person was that
fun yeah don't get daddy you already got
me on the nose oh don't do that yes this
will make sense soon they're bringing in
a painter to paint this wall because I
don't know exactly
oh man hey is gonna be mad yeah that you
did this without her home pretty good
though you're like an artist
are you doing I got my dragon soul fight
and my dragon are you a dragon warrior
yeah yeah and we caught a baby dragon
right here huh
good kid you kind of breathe fire huh
we are enjoying ah sighs it is feeling
really good right now it is kind of nice
just like ghosts are like ups and downs
of not feeling like his best I didn't
want to give you an update laughter
jerks get bad his chest x-ray results
which I I must insist because she liked
it said okay I got the result he has
pneumonia but then she called and said
okay I just looked at the results and he
has bronchitis but after listening
seeing him and with his high fever we
are going to treat it like pneumonia so
which I'm happy with I want her to treat
it you know with as pneumonia so that we
can kick it in the butt because it
probably will turn into that kind of if
it sounds like that it's probably the
chat but the check sucks chest x-rays do
not show that I think that's kind of
better because I don't think that he has
pneumonia but we're going to treat it
like it it so either way it's all just
kind of scary but I think he's going to
start feeling better here realized it
just taken me there enjoying some green
grass and some fresh air it's a really
really nice day today good news I was so
excited this morning because I got three
eggs I've been getting three ate pretty
consistently buying that through the
other day but then today I found another
one I had four eggs today I think
chickens for eggs that is pretty good
odds if you ask me and one of them was
not Susan which I don't expect her to
lay she just lays me little tiny white
eggs so there's only one chicken that
isn't laying as consistently as the
others I would say I'm just really
excited I expect like five on a good day
six on the best day but four is like
pretty good then how you feeling Ben you

comfortable but I get really nervous
when my kids are sick especially with
something that's obviously going to you
