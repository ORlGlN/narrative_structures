strawberries yeah we had a fun day
outside putting the coop all together
it's all finished right now you can
probably hear they're still working on
the wood accent wall probably not gonna
show you that till it's all finished but
I know a lot of people are gonna be
wondering why didn't it Missy and her
dad do it well ended up being that if
they wanted to do it it actually cost a
whole lot more and it'd be a lot more
work we found someone really really
awesome to put it together they're super
talented it looks amazing
I can really want to do the experience
yeah I think they've sort of been really
awesome but me my dad are really good at
making functional things I don't know
what do you think just to look pretty
yeah and so it probably would turn out
and beautiful yeah so having
professionals do it and actually ended
up being cheaper I think than doing it
ourselves
which was nice and the whole thing is
just gonna be really cool so we'll show
you guys when it's all finished with a
big grand reveal you got a cookie yeah
how'd you get a cookie I know I'm pretty
sure that's the cookie I took out of the

what is this instrument it's very
interesting it has two strings group
what is this called the mandolin oh okay
and all it is is it's essentially guitar
the top four strings of guitar but it's
upside down it's backwards oh I want to
play AG chord but it's way out of tune

more soon but we just had an amazing
pre-production meeting going over all of
it so exciting stop get excited
they're in bed and my voice is coming
back slowly but surely little bit good
yeah that's like torture thank you talk
ill II can't tell Ollie what to do yeah
okay and he doesn't listen like he's
just like why are you talking like that
like he just he's like I'm joking or
something I don't know and then like if
I whisper to him he's just like yeah so
funny relating in front of a new wood
wall yeah that smells like a barn in
here oh is so fun yeah it's pretty cool
we wanted to take this time out though
to talk about what happened this morning
you guys don't know this morning a
gunman opened fire in a nightclub killed
over I think over 50 people and it was
horrific really I mean the day before
you know you hear about Christina grimey
murdered outside of her meet-and-greet
and then this the next day I kind of
woke up and I was like what no that
didn't happen but it actually did like
that kind of horror exists in our world
it was just really sad and we just
wanted to say like our prayers are with
Orlando right now and for everyone
dealing with it it's not something that
you should have to deal with it's really
sad too I mean it's just scary as
parents I think when you have kids the
world has didn't even scarier place
because you just want your kids to be
able to live in peace and not have to
fear for the world they live and not
have to fear to live their lives yeah so
yeah we just want to say that we're
praying for Orlando and started end the
vlog on a sad note but yeah you should
say something know that we're thinking
about that and praying about it and it's
really sad anyways she's on the Block
tired yeah no your bed I'm hoping since
day to sleep I just heard him cry so let
me get back to sleeping through the
night anyways I hope you guys enjoyed
today's video give it a thumbs up if you
