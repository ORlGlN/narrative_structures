I'm just gonna pour this fresh can of
fresh gypsy blood into this pan ha ha ha
ha ha just kidding it's tomato soup hey
baby boy nice tie this is our son baby
boy he's gonna do amazing things
what what's so funny good morning good
morning baby
you woke up with the biggest smile on
his face he's just been playing mmm
morning kisses yeah when kiss is more
some guys been sleeping on daddy all
morning can't figure out what side he
wants to be on I'm sure they said thank
this side you like this side
what did make up your mind I just
realized that InP this morning
so I pretty much already have a full
bladder and I have to drink all this
some free bummed hour that really sucks
good morning I am actually off to a
duck's movement with my room I have been
rushing around all morning trying to
like make phone calls and like confirm
my appointment and I have just been
sitting like really crazy morning
but now I've headed to my appointment
I'm getting an ultrasound
done on my uterus and figure out you
know the shape because there's all kinds
of confusing information out there and
whether or not we're going to fix it all
that I'm a little nervous about it
because everyone is told me that like a
few people told me that it's like kind
of hurts and that is uncomfortable Simon
like kind of stressing about it and I'm
super bummed because I have to drink
like all this water this left my home
but I feel kind of sad actually didn't
even get a chance to nurse him so I
brought my pumps on to pump in the car
which sucks and I just spit on you guys
sorry
she nearly finished off this whole
bottle of dr. Brown's goodness hum baby
boy home boy bad boy look at this silly
monkey you guys see this silly monkey
hey you got a silly monkey on you we
made it and then my butt hurts I feel
like I'm pregnant again and I have to
pee really badly like always I always
had to pee I'm starting to remember all
the comments of people telling me that
it's really painful and uncomfortable
because I guess they have to like dilate
you and go into the uterus so I'm like
they feel my uterus with saline and then
yeah so I'm like God and I was supposed
to take Advil I remember people are like
take three hands before you go I didn't
do that i don't have Advil
so I'm starting to like really stressed
about it but I got my mommy here so
she's gonna hold my hand
but I'm looking quite stylish today in
my fall outfit I love this shirt it's so
cute it has little holes in it I know
you guys already see it if you haven't
watched my fall haul you should watch it
because it shows where I got all this
stuff yeah are you wearing my boots it's
gonna be a good day when you get to wear
your boots right got baby ollie to sleep
which is good because I really have a
lot of work that I need to do for a
while there he was only sleeping and my
arms but then I finally got him in the
crib and I set up the baby monitor so I
can listen to him oh oh
I think he's okay and this monitor I
really hate this monitor I can't wait
until we can find one we want to get one
with a video where we can actually like
see him just like a cheap crappy I'm
pretty sure Missy Missy's dad got this
from my garage so I was like here you go

murdered no sleeping uh-oh
it didn't really last long okay baby
okay
nap times over hey baby boy hey hey Oh
big yawns was that good nap got a little
good nap in huh don't know he's laughing
or crying no he's crying so that was a
big waste of our time
I got in there I put on my gown they put
a hospital thing on me cuz I guess it's
like a real like procedure and
everything and apparently the doctor who
was supposed to do the ultrasound isn't
there and he's like scheduled it
completely wrong it was like a really
really weird time like everyone was
super confused and they're like why are
you doing this and it's really weird so
in the end I didn't get anything done
total waste my time I even called this
morning and waited on on the phone for
like ever to confirm that I really did
have an appointment and like yeah cuz I
never got like a confirmation so like
