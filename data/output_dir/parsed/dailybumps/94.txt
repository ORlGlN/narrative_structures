- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- What have you been doing this morning?
- Just eating breakfast.
- Eating breakfast and looking for Fred.
- Yeah.
- Have you seen anyone
who looks like this?
Right? (laughs)
Ollie says he thinks Fred
is running late again.
What's that noise?
Is that us singing?
Let's go see.
That's our song from
our new Christmas album!
That's so weird.
We just woke up.
I've got ready for the day.
But there's like music playing on in here.
Who started the music?
Let's keep a look out.
Where's Fred, Finn?
- Where is it?
-  You don't know?
- No.
-  Hmm.
'Kay, let me know when you find him.
- Fred!
- What?
I just stopped recording.
You see him?
Oh my goodness, he's up here.
Okay.
I'm gonna go look.
Let's see what he's doing.
Oh my goodness.
I think this explains a lot guys.
He's wearing headphones
and listening to music.
And it says jingle bells rock.
He's been listening to our music guys,
our new album.
How cool.
Do you like it Fred?
I don't know if you can tell,
but he looks pretty happy.
And I'd say he's enjoying the new album.
- I wanna see him a bit closer.
- A little bit closer?
Here we go, standing on top of a table.
Picking up a child.
What do you think?
He's gonna sing to our song.
He's probably listening to
you sing Christmas carols.
You're singing Jingle Bells and stuff.
How cool.
Don't touch him.
You wanna see Finn?
-  Yeah.
- Oh my goodness, is
he listening to music?
- Yeah.
- Aw.
How cool.
Alright, well you tell Santa, Fred,
that we have a new Christmas album out.
I mean I think it's pretty cool.
I think it's a pretty good
Christmas music, right?
Do you like our new album?
If you guys want to listen
to our new Christmas album,
just like Fred,
make sure you guys click
the link down below
and go ahead on over iTunes
and look up Daily Bumps.
We all have a huge part in the new album.
And it's really special.
Like I'm so excited about it.
I was so nervous about it.
And I actually feel like
it turned out pretty good.
No, I'm not a singer, no
I'm not amazing or anything,
but I feel like it turned out to where
you don't have to plug
your ears if I'm singing.
So that's good.
- Because I have a dinosaur.
-  Whoa, where did you get that?
- From Kelsey and Corbin, 'cause
it was my pirate birthday.
- Oh really?
- Yeah.
- Whoa, he's walking.
That's so cool.
He walks a little bit slow.
I bet he'll walk a lot
better on the table.
Look at him go, see?
(laughs)
That is a very loud toy.
Thank you Kelsey and
Corbin for the amazing toy.
(laughs)
Oh hey Finn.
Oh, you're not Finn.
You're Emma.
Hi Emma.
So our cousin Rose dropped
off her two little girls,
Alivia and Emma.
And this is Emma.
How old is she?
- She's about six months.
-  Six months and
she's so sweet and calm.
And yeah.
- I know.
She's like the easiest baby.
Even her mom says she's the easiest baby.
So I'm like, yeah I'll
babysit the easiest baby
in the world.
- Are you a good baby?
Are you a good baby?
- She says that she
doesn't really cry a lot.
I didn't have to feed her
'cause she won't really whine.
I's like oh my goodness.
It's gonna be easy.
-  It's so weird seeing
you with a little baby girl.
'Cause you're such a boy's mom.
- I know it's so weird
seeing such a bright color
on someone.
-  I know, that's true.
- They're so fun.
-  Hi.
And then Alivia's here
playing with good ole
Buzz Light year, huh?
That's so nice of you Ollie and Finn
to share your toys with Alivia.
Is that baby Jesus?
- Yeah.
-  It's like a cute,
little kids' nativity scene.
You gonna set it all up?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
So you put baby Jesus right there.
That's Joseph, his dad.
Oh, he's right there, he's not in there?
- Yeah.
- And then the wise men.
Oh the wise men gets to
stand next to baby Jesus,
but his dad doesn't?
Oh there's Mary.
Okay, that's his mom.
More wise men.
- This one.
-  There we go.
And the angel goes on top?
- Yeah.
- Oh that's cute.
- Yeah.
And then animals go right here.
-  Oh, how cute.
("Silent Night")
- Yay, toesies.
(Bryan laughs)
-  Is Ollie kissing your feet?
Oh hey Emma.
You gonna come play with us?
- You wanna play?
- So this is so fun
watching Alivia and Emma.
Because it's not only
like we have four kids,
and two girls, but also like
the boys have two sisters.
That they have to like
behave with and take care of
and share with.
I'm like, I don't know.
Would they like to have a sister?
- I don't know, 'cause
he was like so excited
to show Alivia his dinosaur,
but she was scared of it.
No.
Finn is getting some of
the cutest big brother,
oh Ollie too. (laughs)
You guys, when mommy has another baby,
are you gonna be the
best big brothers ever?
- Yeah.
- Finn is like so sweet.
Like he just loves her.
He's like gimme a hug.
(laughs)
Oh my goodness.
Our next one better love cuddles, huh?
I'm so excited.
When we have another one,
I think both the boys
are gonna be the sweetest.
I feel like with Ollie,
he wasn't super into Finn
when he was born, 'cause he was just like
in a different stage in life,
like had always just been on his own.
And it's just different,
depending on like their age and stuff.
But now they're both like at that age
and even Finn it's just
because he's had other kids
in his life a lot,
I think he could be so
happy to be a big brother.
It's so cute watching
him do this with Emma.
He loves you, doesn't he?
-  Hey Finn, is that your bottle?
No.
- You're not gonna try it.
You're gonna give it to the baby.
You wanna feed her?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay,
let's go sit down.
-  Finn is so excited to feed Emma.
We have no idea if this is gonna work.
- I know.
- But we're like,
okay, we'll let you try.
- Okay, put the bottle in her mouth.
You gotta hold it up for her.
- Yay.
- You gotta hold it like this.
-  You're doing it buddy.
Oh, (laughs) he's like,
I'll keep that warm for you.
- That's so funny.
You are not a baby.
-  We're just practicing
for a baby sister, huh?
Oh my gosh, you are adorable Finn.
- No, no mister.
Oh my goodness.
He's going back a few years.
-  Finn is doing such a good job,
practicing for a baby sister maybe?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
(laughs) He's so cute.
Alivia and Ollie are also having
so much fun playing together.
They are currently raiding the pantry.
You finding any good snacks guys?
- Yeah, I'm getting a snack for Alivia.
- That's so nice of you.
- By the way, it may be
confusing to some of you,
but yes, Ollie has two little
cousins, both name Olivia.
One is spelled with an O.
and Alivia spelled with A.
(bright music)
Oh, Finn's got some too.
- He got spacey ones.
-  These are sour cream, yeah here,
hold it and I'll open it.
There you go buddy.
- Thanks.
-  That's for all
your hard work you did
taking care of the baby, 'kay?
Oh you want it all the way off?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
There you go.
-  Did you guys
have so much fun today?
- Yeah, but look.
-  Playing with, yeah,
she's crawling under you.
Alivia, you were so good.
And Emma you were so easy.
-  Say thank you.
- Thanks for coming over girls.
It's a race to the toys.
It's a race to the toys.
Go, go, go!
Did you have fun pretending
that we had little sisters?
Yeah.
How fun.

Happy birthday Jesus, I love you.
- Me!
-  Yeah, that's you.
Guess what time it is boys?
What time is it?
- Peanut butter time.
- If you guys don't know,
every year I make peanut butter balls.
It's a very special recipe.
I think there's a recipe
up online that I did.
I'm thinking on my channel.
You guys can check it out,
look for like Missy Lanning's
peanut butter balls.
I love them.
Every year we make them.
It's a little overwhelming,
'cause we make a lot
of peanut butter balls.
- Yes!
- (laughs) How many peanut
butter balls do we make, Ollie?
- 400 balls.
-  That's right.
We make 400 balls out of
all this peanut butter, huh?
- Yeah.
- But anyways I'm starting it now.
We just put three pounds
of butter in there.
- And it smells like peanut butter.
- My hands are gonna
smell like peanut butter
for the next two weeks because
after I start rolling stuff,
I feel like it just seeps into my skin.
And I'm just like, still
smells like peanut butter.
Alright, let's get started!
(bright music)
Alright, we've just mixed all
the melted butter in here.
And now we have to put in two
pounds of powdered sugar huh?
I think Ollie's like a little,
like this does not look good Mom.
I don't want that.
But, I think you're gonna be
amazed when it's done Ollie.
It's gonna be delicious.
This is like where it gets messy.
And kinda crazy.
Gotta have taste testers huh?
Just a little bit.
No no, okay.
Here.
Yeah, there you go.
Just like that.
Lick your finger.
Oh my goodness, you can't even try that.
Oh my goodness, you don't like it?
Alright, go wash your hands then.
Alright your turn Finn, try it.
Tell me if you like it, try it.
How is it?
- Good.
- Is it good?
- Yeah.
- See your brother's crazy.
It's sugar you silly.
- Mama, what are we doing?
- We're making peanut butter balls.
- Yes sir.
- Are you ready, should I turn it on?
- Yeah!
- Okay, you gotta point
it right at the machine,
so you can see what happens.
We're gonna put the sugar in.
We've already put a lot
in, but it gets messy.
- Okay, I'm not gonna do this.
I don't want to get it on the camera.
- Okay, just hold the camera back.
There you go.
What do you think?
- Good.
It's getting all powdery up here.
- Yeah, we have a lot of smoke guys.
- It looks like smoke in the air.
I don't know if you guys can see it but.
- I can see it.
- You can see it, huh?
- Yeah.
- Where did Finn go?
Finn, come here!
Get it in there, get it in there, hurry!
(laughing)
We've got a bunch of
peanut butter all mixed.
You gotta point it here.
-  Look at all that guys.
Oh it's fall.
- (laughs) It's fallen.
Here, hold it back.
There, see how they can see it now?
- Yeah.
- Wow.
This is a lot of peanut butter.
-  Now they don't
see the smoke anymore.
- Yeah, the smoke all went away.
It's not really smoke,
it's just like the powder
that was poofed up.
- Yeah, but I think it is smoke guys.
-  You are filthy!
- Got a little on my face.
-  Oh yep, it's all over your face.
And it's all over your
pants and the counter.
Is it all over you?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Okay Finn, you gotta try
some of that peanut butter.
Here, I'll help you.
How is it?
- Good.
- Is that good?
- Yeah.
- You try it.
- You love it?
Okay, I'm gonna try it.
Um, that is so good.
Oliver, gotta try it.
(laughs)
Okay boys, it's all
mixed up and packaged up.
Now we gotta put it in the
fridge so it can chill.
And while it chills, I
think we should chill
and watch a movie.
We're gonna get this nice and hard
and then probably either
tonight or tomorrow,
I'll start rolling.
And that is like the longest process.
Actually I really don't know
if that's the longest process
or then dipping all the
balls is the longest process.
I'm guessing dipping is the worst.
So anyways, we have a
lot of work to do still.
But we got the first part done.
Close refrigerator.
Whew, okay.
Let's go watch a Christmas movie, okay?
-  Okay.
(bright music)
-  So I wanted to show
you guys what I did tonight.
I got this locket for
Missy for her birthday
back in October.
And I just finally got around to putting
pictures in it for her.
'Cause getting pictures to fill a locket
is very, very difficult.
They are very, very small.
Smaller than you may think, even.
So I wanted to show you guys.
Check that out you guys.
You can see us.
We're very tiny, but you can see us.
I got a family photo on that side
and a really cute photo of
Ollie and Finn on that side.
Look at that.
It's so cool.
You guys getting ready for bed?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Advent calendar time?
How many have you put together tonight?
- Just one tonight.
But I'm still doing it.
-  Oh the instructions
are inside, that's cool.
- Well it's not instructions though,
'cause literally looking at it,
I'm like okay that goes there,
that goes there.
- Oh it's not?
Okay.
- But it is really hard.
-  You're right,
it is kinda doing it
with no book huh?
As the kids just wait patiently
for it to be finished.
- Yeah we did it.
-  Oh what's the new
Tsum Tsum you got Ollie?
Or is that Finn's?
Oh that's so cool!
- That's mine.
-  Do you know who that is Ollie?
- What?
- It's Sully.
From Monsters Inc.
He's kinda like a reindeer, huh?
Anyway I think that's
all for today's video.
I did wanna give you guys a little update.
We signed all the rest
of the calendars today,
so they're all shipped
off to distribution,
so if you haven't
received your calendar yet
you should be getting it very, very soon.
So I wanted to fill you guys in on that.
But as for that, I think
that's all for today's video.
But if you enjoy it you
should give it a thumb's up.
Subscribe.
