-  What?
- We have got a ounce-ment.
-  "A ounce-ment"?
- An ounce-ment.
- Announcement? We do?
We do?
(laughter)
The boys are just like,
"Oh you made the bed.
"Awesome, I'll jump all over it."

- Good morning!
- Good morning!
Good morning, boys.
Where are we goin'?
- We're goin' to music class!
- Yeah.
You're gonna go learn about music, Fin?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Good morning, guys.
The boys are headed out with
Missy to go to music class.
I've got some work to get done.
Have fun, okay?
(Oliver squeals)
- You guys, we are so late.
We were already gonna be
late when we left the house.
And so I was a little bummed about that
'cause I'm not normally late,
but then we hit a ton of traffic
and so we're so late right now.
Let's hurry up and get
to music class, 'kay?
- Yeah!
-  Yeah!
- Ollie, how was music class?
- Good.
- I almost said swim class.
He was in swim class for years.
We actually aren't in
swim class right now,
but I just signed them up
for a class in a few weeks.
So I'm really excited to
see them back in swim class.
But, yeah, we just did
music class and everything.
They were so cute.
Fin is always so clingy in this class,
and he doesn't really like to participate.
And so it's fun for me to bring Ollie
because Ollie does like participating
and doing things, and so
Fin's watching him like,
"Hm, maybe I do want to do that."
And today, he actually
did a little bit more
than he normally does.
So I really, really am
liking music class just
because I think it's
really cool for the kids
to just learn how to sit, pay attention.
And then music is just always a cool thing
to get incorporated into their
soul and into their life.
Just helping them learn beats
and stuff like that is
really, really neat.
All right, should we go home to see Daddy?
- Da.
-  All right, let's go.
- Good morning, guys.
I wanted to give you all
a little update on Luna.
You wanna sit?
So yesterday, Luna got spayed,
and she is doing so well today.
The doctor said that she might be "browsy"
for about 24 hours.
She might also might have
trouble eating and stuff.
We've been giving her a
little bit of medicine.
She ate.
She went potty today like
a good girl, (laughs)
and she's feelin' a lot better.
She has a lot of her energy back.
And we have to keep reminding Karma
that she is not a hundred percent,
and you can't be so rough with her.
Look, he's kissing me.
But seriously, Karma and Luna are
like boyfriend and girlfriend.
It's so cute.
They lay down next to each other.
They give each other kisses.
Karma's like, "Thank you for getting me
"a girlfriend for Christmas." (laughs)
You're so funny, Karma.
He's a good doggie.
And Luna, you're a good puppy, too, huh?
You guys are good friends.
See? Look at them.
They're kissing. Aw! (laughs)
They kiss. It's so funny.
They are literally in a relationship.
So it's a good thing we
got her spayed. (laughs)
Although Karma is fixed also.
And, yes, there's already a little
Christmas tree in my office.
I had to go a little Christmasy.
I picked this up the other day,
and I'm not sure if I like it here.
We might end up using it
somewhere else in the house,
but it's just a cool, cute,
little Christmas tree.
It's battery powered down
there, too, which is nice,
but I didn't think that I
would be the first one to put
up a Christmas tree.
I thought for sure it would be Missy.
I know she's excited to
get all the trees up,
but I got the first one.
And I wasn't even planning on having one
in my office, but I was
like, "You know what?
"I think I wanna put one there."
Oh, and look.
I got a new lounger, too,
because Missy (laughs)
really wanted the one
that was in here in the playroom.
So we were shuffling couches (chuckles)
trying to find something that works.
So, yeah.
I got a cool new seating system,
and this goes flat and it's really soft.
And I can sit here and just
look at my Christmas tree.
Oh, hi, Luna.
Bye, Luna.
- I like the pictures.
-  I do, too.
- You know which picture I like?
-  Which one do you like?
- Over here.
I like baby Luna and the Christmas tree.
-  Yeah, baby Luna.
And baby you guys.
Look at you guys.
Look so young.
That was when we had our Christmas tree up
in the formal, huh?
- Yeah, when it was Christmas.
-  Yeah, I know.
Guess what.
- What?
-  It's almost Christmas.
- Yay!
-  Hey, Fin.
Did you want a drink, bud?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
This is a daily struggle.
Not even a daily struggle.
Like an hourly struggle.
He wants a drink from up here,
but he only wants it from a specific cup.
He is in his terrible
twos, and that is it.
So, let's figure out
what cup you want, 'kay?
- 'Kay.
- 'Kay. Do you want this one?
-  Yeah.
- That one?
- Da!
- What? No.
You don't want that one.
- Dat 'n.
- Okay, okay. Here.
Let's try it again.
Ready?
Do you want this one?
-  No.
- Do you want this one?
- Da.
-  Yeah?
(Oliver laughs)
Why are you saying that?
- Dat 'n.
- (laughs) Usually we have this struggle
that goes on for like five minutes.
You want this one?
-  No.
- No?
Do you want Batman?
-  No.
- No.
Do you want this one?
- Da!
- Yeah?
- I want dat 'n.
I want mil'.
-  And you want milk?
- Yeah.
- Anyways, it is just
like his daily struggle,
and it usually takes me five minutes
to figure out exactly which cup he wants.
You want this one?
And you want milk?
- Dat 'n. Mil'.
- Okay, let's do it.
Hey, Fin.
Do you want this one?
- No.
-  No? (laughs)
Sometimes he'll say yes to this one,
but then, when I bring down the top,
he's like, "No! Not that one!"
Huh?
Is this what you wanted?
(Fin whines)
I thought you wanted this.
You want this one.
You said you wanted that one.
Oh, my goodness.
- Mama!
-  You want a different top?
Oh, I know what he wants.
I know what he wants.
This is not gonna work,
but you want it like that.
Fin, you are going to spill that.
That's not gonna work, dude. (laughs)
Is your brother silly?
Fin, that's not gonna work.
Don't, you're gonna spill it.
Finley Jay, you are going to spill that.
Wow.
You're suckin' that down, though, bud.
- We have got a ounce-ment!
-  What?
- We have got a once-ment!
-  "A ounce-ment"?
- An ounce-ment.
- Announcement! We do?
We do?
(Bryan and Missy laugh)
The boys are just like,
"Oh, you made the bed.
"Awesome, I'll just all over it."
- Fin, we have an announcement.
Don't we? Yes.
You guys remember we had
an announcement last week.
- Yep.
- We are doing our new 2018 calendar,
but we wanted to do something even bigger
and special than that
for the Christmas season.
So we have designed a--
Ollie, you wanna say it?
- Doo na coloring book!
- That's right, you guys.
We designed our very first coloring book,
and it is so cool.
It's called Coloring with Family,
and it's basically a
bunch of family portraits
and doodles and stuff from
the blogs like Easter eggs.
- Nice.
- Its' really, really cool.
- Some of the pictures are
just so cute and so fun,
and I'm so excited to
see how people color them
and send us pictures of them.
I think it's gonna be so much fun.
- Ollie, guess what.
- What?
- There's even a picture of you to color.
(Oliver gasps)
Do you wanna color a picture of yourself?
(Missy laughs)
Isn't that gonna be so fun
coloring that?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Yeah!
Oh, Fin thinks I should be wearing a hat.
- I'll wear the hat, 'kay?
(Bryan laughs)
-  You look
beautiful with that hat.
- Thank you.
- Get a colorin' book!
- That's right.
Link down below in the description.
Go order your coloring book
fast.
- Go ask your mom and dad
to go order you a coloring
book for Christmas.
- Yes.
And if you're excited about this,
be sure to put it on your Christmas list
because we want you guys to order them
so you can have them
in time for Christmas.
And when you do get them,
be sure to color all the pages.
Either Tweet them or Instagram them to us
'cause we're so excited to
see how you guys color us.
- Yeah.
It's gonna be so fun.
- And all our cool
little doodles.
- I'm excited to color it.
I'm gonna get all my fancy (Bryan laughs)
coloring pencils out.
I'm gonna color that thing.
- Yes.
I'm so excited we were able to actually
finish a coloring book for you guys.
We've been working on it
for a couple months now.
- It was a lot of work.
- It was a lot of work.
I think it's cool because it's something
so unique that not--
Have other YouTubers done it?
I'm sure some have, but it's
not a common thing you see.
So, it's gonna be really cool.
- We've got lots of stuff comin',
and we're so excited about it.
- Yes.
So, link down below in the description,
dailybumpsmerch.com.
I also want to mention: if you
haven't ordered a calendar,
you can do a bundle
package for both of them,
and it makes it a lot cheaper, too.
So, that's cool.
So, go check that out on our
Daily Bumps Merch site now.
Look who's here.
My mom showed up for
dinner with my Aunt Bev.
Say hi.
- Hello.
- We are cookin' up some spaghetti
so that we can have a family dinner.
Right, Ollie?
- Yeah.
-  You gonna eat some spaghetti?
- No.
-  No?
- Oatmeal!
-  You want oatmeal?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You're not gonna have
spaghetti and meatballs?
-  (laughs) He loves oatmeal.
Missy has been slavin' away on the stove.
Ooh, you got some spaghetti, Fin?
Does that look yummy?
- Da. (Missy laughs)
-  Yeah.
He's like, "Yeah."
I'm so excited to eat some spaghetti.
It is bedtime, and Fin
cannot get off this.
Oh, my gosh.
That was so fast.
- He's so fast on it.
-  Where'd he go?
Where'd he go? (gasps)
Oh, no.
Are you headed down the dark hallway?
Come on.
- 'Kay, go to Daddy.
Ready, go!
-  Let's ride it
to bed.
- He almost picks it up, it feels like.
-  Yeah, he's pretty cool.
He's a pretty cool dude.
Ready for bed, Fin?
- No.
-  No?
-  He's so tired.
He's barely awake.
-  (laughs) Why are you so silly?
- You can't put the bike in your crib.
Okay, Fin?
-  'Kay.
-  He really wants
to sleep with it, though.
-  Oh, I know.
(Bryan laughs)
- All right.
- He just rides it around the house!
- I know.
Like, "Today, I did this."
- You're so cute, Fin. (laughs)
And that's your Spiderman one?
Is this just your garage,
right outside your crib?
- He gets up in the morning
and hops on that thing
and doesn't turn it off.
-  Yeah. (laughs)
Here.
Let's turn it around so when
you wake up in the morning,
you can just jump right on it, okay?
Or right now. Sure.
You could use it to escape bedtime.
Escaping bedtime! (laughs)
You're so funny, dude.
(Fin babbles)
Ride that one, too?
- Da.
- 'Kay.
- Wait, no.
Fin, you're done.
You're done. (Bryan laughs)
You're done.
-  He's actually gone.
- Come on.
- (laughs) I love it so much.
He's so cute.
(Fin laughs)
There you go.
Night night, Fin.
- Say, "Night night, Daddy."
- All right, come give
me a kiss goodnight.
Come gimme kiss.
I love you.
-  Don't let him out.
-  Oh, he's trying to escape!
You're trying to escape. (laughs)
- 'Kay, let's go.
(Bryan laughs)
Fin, you wanna fly?
-  No.
-  'Kay, good luck with that.
(Fin laughs)
Night, Fin! (laughs)
- All right.
Now, it's time for this one's bedtime.
Are you so tired?
- Yeah.
- You had such a long, fun day, huh?
- Yeah, but I'm...
- Oh, he wants to show you guys the books
that we picked out today, okay?
Are you gonna show 'em?
We read books every single night,
and we read about three.
Sometimes he gets four if
he sneaks one in there, huh?
(laughs) And it's definitely
just what he needs
before he falls asleep.
So he wants to show you the books
that we're reading tonight.
You ready?
- Snuggle up.
-  Snug as a Bug.
- Snug as a Bug, How to Catch a Monster,
(mumbles) are Awesome...
Goodnight Moon.
-  Yeah!
These are all the books
we're reading tonight.
-  H.
-  Oh, yeah.
And he knows that's an H right there.
Good job!
Do you see anything else?
He's trying to look.
Right here is a little H.
You see the little H?
You see it?
-  No.
-  Not really.
You learned B.
You see the B?
-  B?
-  Nope, that's a G. (laughs)
Oh, you see U.
That's a U, 'member?
What does U stand for?
Or sound like?
- H-h-horse.
- (laughs) It's a good thing
preschool's workin' for ya.
I'm actually really proud of him,
but sometimes, he says
the funniest things.
He'll be like, "What does
a U stand for? H-h-horse."
Let's get to readin'.
We're gonna go ahead and end this video,
so make sure you give it a big
thumbs up if you enjoyed it!
Yeah.
And we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Make sure you guys go check
out those coloring books, huh?
- Yeah.
- All right. And...
- Bye. Boop!
