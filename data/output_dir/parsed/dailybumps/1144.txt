I feel like there are moments in life
that define you as a human and as a
couple as a family and I just feel so
blessed to have those moments captured
and I can just go back and look at that
many times
you know what's crazy is that we've been
through six years of marriage but I feel
like this last year has been the
craziest because everything has changed
in her life our like relationship has
changed our family dynamic has changed
and we're living on our own for the
first time and we're supporting her
family and it's just like crazier
you're only given one little spark of
madness you mustn't lose it sometimes
we're only given one shot or one chance
or one little spark of madness and you
have to hang on to it for us it's this
it's talking to you guys it's being a
part of this community growing this
YouTube channel from nothing this is our
spark of madness
you
this year has been crazy for us I found
my birth father you don't know one but
you have a huge family which I never
would have thought in a million years I
would ever be able to do and you guys
totally helped with that happy birthday
I think one of the biggest things we did
this year though was when Missy actually
got her surgery so that we can have more
kids and it was almost in a way paving
the future for our family and having
that be successful was just an amazing
feeling
we don't really know what this next year
of our life has in store for us and
that's kind of the point
life is about the moments that you don't
plan the laughter the tears the
milestones is something I think that
makes those memories even more
unforgettable and that's where
be yeah wherever you win
