- Waaah.
Say good morning.

so we are headed to the Farmer's Market.
Finn say hi.
- Hi.
-  He's hiding.
(laughing)
Hey dude.
- More.
- Yes Finn is excited, Ollie's

We are headed to the Farmer's
Market, this weekend,
and we're gonna meet
Kelsie and Corbin there.
And we're just gonna shop
around for some plants,
or food, or all types of things.
- Um, it's officially Fall,
so we're gonna decorate
- Yes.
-  our house with fall things.
- So we need like pumpkins
and lots of cool stuff like that, so.
Check out Buzz Lightyear
on my wrist you guys.
(laughing) Sometimes he disappears too.
(relaxing country folk music)
(bubble pops)
- Strawberries
- That's right.
These boys always have to
stop by the strawberry stand.
-  Let mommy buy them, k.
-  Sometimes they
sneak them from the baskets
and we're forced to buy
the whole thing (laughs).
Look at these good looking strawberries.
Kids love 'em.
What is this?
- I don't know, they look fake.
Oh my gosh, they're real.
-  I know.
- That's so cool.
-  I've never seen this before.
- Are they tomatoes, like what?
-  Or some type of pepper?
They look like little pumpkins.
- That's cool.
-  Ollie what
do you think these are?
- Pumpkins, pumpkins, pumpkins.
-  They look like pumpkins?
- Yes.
-  (laughs) It's
interesting thing to have
at the flower place.
I've never seen those before.
Ollie look at this apron.
It's got Mickey Mouse on it (laughs).
Isn't that cool (laughs)?
They have like all types
of handmade aprons,
and clothes, and stuff here.
The boys got rubber band guns.
Wow.
Oh, is that one Finn's?
- Yeah.
- That's pretty cool though, huh?
- I wanted a boat.
- Are you Mr. Grumpy Gills right now?
(laughing) This ones happy.
(babbles)
- Yeah, I got this new plant
for my wall section in my office
because one of 'em is dying.
And I think it's so unique
cuz it's got like a
little bit of purple in it
and a little bit of green
- Mama, Dada.
-  Whoa, dude.
What are you doing?
You're gonna tip the stroller silly.
(relaxing country folk music)
Mexican food time.
I am so excited for this.
Boys, you got a quesadilla?
And look at this tiny, little burrito.
- Mama.
-  Is he eating it?
- Yeah.
-  He's been
loving those lately, huh?
- He likes beans.
- Yeah, that's awesome.
We are all nestled in the shade
and it feels so good out here.
Eating some good Mexican food.
(relaxing country folk music)
- Fall time.
- Yes it is.
It is officially Fall time in our house.
We've got Nightmare Before Christmas on
and we are decorating the house
for Fall.
So excited we get to bring
out all our old decorations,
to put in different places.
Check out this pumpkin planter we got
from the Farmer's Market today, you guys.
This is a real pumpkin.
These are real succulents inside of it.
Basically when this pumpkin starts rotting
you bury it, bury the
pumpkin under ground,
and it acts as a compost.
And then you get, like a little,
mini succulent garden outside.
Think that is so cool.
How we doing babe?
- Good.
That is like my favorite thing.
- I'm lovin' it.
-  It's so cool.
We have a lot of Fall decor.
I didn't' know we had that much.
- Oh yeah, we got like six buckets of it.
-  Yeah we've got
leaves, we've got scarecrows,
we've got acorn wreaths.
- Yeah this was on the
chicken coop last year.
-  Oh yeah.
- We have something
else up there right now,
so I might use this somewhere else.
But, it's really pretty.
-  Yeah.
Oh, and we also do have
this big wreath Babe.
-  Yeah, you wanna
put that on the front door?
-  And another scarecrow.
Yeah, that's a good front door one.
Alright Ollie, what do you wanna show 'em?
- Um, a gun.
-  Look at this gun he
got from the Farmer's Market.
It's a handmade gun
powered by rubber bands
and what does it shoot?
- Bullets.
-  It shoots like those
little white balls, right?
- Yeah.
-  Can you get 'em and show me?
- Can't find some.
-  We'll find 'em.
Hey Finn, do you know where the balls are?
- (babbles)
- In here?
He pointed in here.
Gotta be some in here.
Finn, what did you do with the balls
for Ollie's new gun?
Do you know where they are?
- (babbles)
- Go find 'em.
What (laughs)?
I think he might think we're
posing for a thumbnail.
K, go ahh.
- Ahh.
- He's basically a YouTube pro.
See.
Go, whoa.
- Ahh.
- Go, ahh.
- Ahhh.
- (laughing) He has one expression
for all our thumbnails, don't you?
Yeah.
- Yeah.
(cheerful xylophone music)
So Sunday has usually become our day
to go to the Farmer's
Market, stock up on veggies,
and fruits, and flowers, and plants,
and then also take care of all of 'em.
So I've been like, watering the plants.
This my day I water all the succulents
and I've been showing you guys that I have
a little star flower cactus in my room.
And it has begun opening.
-  Oh my gosh.
-  Look at that.
Isn't that cool?
- Wow.
- I put it in the sun when we left.
Check this out you guys.
We have four more that are gonna pop open
really soon cuz this one was actually
connected still.
So that one kinda just opened up
but I heard that these flowers
smell really, really gross.
Because they want to
attract flies, and bugs.
Cuz they want the bugs
to land on the plant
and fertilize it.
So I was like really worried.
I was like, oh no.
Cuz I'm pretty sure when I bought this
that flower was there for awhile.
So it didn't have any smell.
- No, I mean..
- You saying this one doesn't right now?
- I definitely don't smell anything bad.
-  Alright, well maybe
it's when it fully opens
and matures.
I don't know.
- It's really cool.
It'll be fun to, I bet it's
gonna get brighter too in color.
-  Yeah, the other one
was like bright red or purple.
- Yeah, it was really cool.
-  Yeah, I'm excited to
see what this one looks like
but I'm gonna give it some sunlight.
It doesn't need sunlight, but
I feel like it's gonna help it
push is a little more.
You know?
(cheerful music)
-  If you're
wondering why all the boys
are hovered together right here.
- Do you see that boys?
What is that?
-  A caterpillar.
-  That is the
very hungry caterpillar.
Isn't that so cool?
-  That is crazy
so is it doing augmentation?
- Its called augmented reality.
-  He was crawling on you.
-  And I just hit an
apple and now he's eating eat.
Do you think he's gonna get big?
-  I think so.
- Ooh, okay touch the
apple on the tree Ollie.
(gasps) It fell.
He's getting another one.
Alright, touch an apple.
Whoa.
- So he got two apples.
- Let's touch this
treasure chest over here.
(gasps) Look at all those fun toys.
- Aww.
-  He's gonna play with 'em.
-  Is that so cool?
And it's, like, in our house?
- It's like, on our carpet.
Where's the caterpillar?
Oh there he is.
He's gettin' big you guys.
-  Gosh.
-  Look at that dude.
-  That's so cool.
That's such a fun game
to play with the boys.
- I know.
He's getting so big.
And look at all these toys
he's playing with now.
-  Finn is like so confused.
He's like, I don't really get it.
- This is so cool Babe.
There's like a little toy box.
Look.
And you can select a toy to play with.
And he plays with it.
-  That's so cute.
- Oh my gosh.
-  What a fun little game.
Is this only on the new iPhone?
- So I think this is like the new AR thing
on the IOS 11.
I think it runs really
well on the new iPhone.
- It's so crazy to think about
the different technologies
that are going to be available
for the kids vs what we had.
They're going to be playing games
with things in the house (laughs).
Hydrate (laughs).
- It's actually right there on your knee.
- Oh.
-  Caterpillar.
Does it tickle?
- That's so cool.
Yup.
Oh my gosh, my knee is tickling.
- Let's get another toy.
Oh look it, we can blow him bubbles.
Alright, we're blowing bubbles.
(coughing)
Blow bubbles.
(laughing)
That is so cool.
(cheerful music)
So I think we are done
setting up the house for Fall.
A couple of things, we don't
really do the full house
for Fall.
We just kind of do the main areas.
Whereas for Christmas, we go all out.
There's Christmas trees everywhere.
For Fall and Halloween time,
there are pumpkins everywhere you guys.
But a lot of pumpkins, we
actually got from Pottery Barn.
I did not know Pottery Barn had
like a lot of Halloween
decor, but they actually do.
So, we got a lot of really
cool pumpkins from there
and something else we got there
is gonna start a brand
new family tradition.
So I thought, I would let Missy share
what our brand new Halloween tradition is.
You guys wanna hear?
- Okay so, Bryan found this really cute
Halloween Advent calendar.
So usually you have
like a Christmas Advent.
-  I don't know if
you can call it an Advent,
but it's a countdown calendar.
- Yeah, you're right.
But I'm really excited about it.
So, look how cute it is.
First of all, it's got
this cute, little skeleton
and the words are so cute.
And then it's got..
-  Ollie's like
why are there balls on it?
(laughing)
- That's what he asked me earlier.
Do you like that skeleton?
- Yeah.
It's cool looking?
-  No.
- So it's got all these little pockets
with numbers on it counting down
all the way to 31.
And then everyday during
the month of October,
there'll be a little piece of candy
for each kid.
And they can take one out all the way
until we get to Halloween.
- That's gonna be such a cool tradition
because we're gonna be able
to countdown to Halloween.
Which is one of Ollie's
favorite holidays, right?
You're so excited for Halloween (laughs).
He asked us today, he's
like, is it Halloween today?
Not yet.
You were so excited though, huh?
- He was so afraid that
he missed Halloween
-  Yeah.
- I'm like trust me, you'll
know when Halloween's here.
Yeah, I love this though.
I think this is super cute.
It's just something I wanna keep around.
-  We should scare them everyday,
before they pick one.
- Scare them.
-  Or wear a Halloween
costume everyday (laughs).
-  Mama (crying).
-  Do something cool.
- Or just tell them everyday,
no candy in this one.
- (laughs) Yeah.
Oops, Jack Skellington forgot
to put a candy in that one.
- Oh, that's so cute.
-  Yeah.
(cheerful music)
- Mama.
- I love you.
Sleep good, k?
I'm gonna put Finn to bed.
- Night Finn.
- No.
He's so tired.
- He missed his nap today, so.
-  Oh, good
night buddy, I love you.
Aww, he really is so tired.
It's time for bed.
One thing that we have
been doing for awhile now,
is having Karma lay with Ollie.
Hey Ollie, do you like
sleeping with Karma?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, why do you
like sleeping with him?
- He protects me.
-  He protects you?
- Yeah.
-  Aww, Karma c'mon.
He's such a good boy about it too.
C'mon, up on the bed.
Alright, hop in bed boys.
Both of ya.
Karma, Olie, hop in bed.
Good night Karma boy.
You're a good puppy.
Thank you for sleeping with Olie.
I love you dude.
