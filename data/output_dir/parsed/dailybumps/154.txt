- OK, so I'm vlogging right now
because I really don't know what to do
at this point, and I have
absolutely no service.
I was actually talking
to my mom at the time.
I don't even know what she heard.
She might be freaking out right now.
But, I don't know what to do.
I'm on a really scary hill.
I've got Ollie in the backseat,
which is really extra scary.
The road is not very safe to walk on.
I've never been in a situation like this.
♫ This is our life ♫
♫ This is our fun ♫
♫ This is who we are ♫
♫ This is our dream ♫
♫ This is our team ♫
♫ Shout among the stars ♫
♫ Take the shooter, I'll be fine ♫
♫ Take this hand and I'll just shine ♫
♫ Let's live it ♫
♫ Live forever ♫
- Morning!
- Good morning, little Spidey.
How you doin' this morning, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Hangin' out with Fin this morning.
Missy took Ollie and
dropped him off at school,
so I always get to hang out with Fin,
which is awesome,
because I feel like he is a lot different
when Ollie's not around.
He's a lot different
when Mama's not around.
So, me and you kinda have
our own special thing, huh?
- Mama is the best.
- I know, Mama's the best, right?
- Yeah.
- Hey did you have dreams
all about Spideyman,
look at, he's all over your pajamas,
he's all over your pajamas!
(Fin and Bryan laughing)
This kid is always all smiles and
he can always brighten my day whole.
(Fin screaming)
(Bryan screaming)
(Bryan laughing)
Alright, Fin I've got
one question for you,
are you ready to spin?
- Yeah
- Yeah, okay, sit back.
We're gonna make this little boy spin.
Ready? And blast off.
(Fin laughing)
He's really going.
Was that fun?
- Ahhh.
(Bryan laughing)
- You're so cute, wanna do it again?
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay, and blast off!
(Fin laughing)
Whaaaat?
You're so funny dude,
okay here try to walk.
Whoa, whoa, ha-ha, you got it, you got it.
- Good morning, guys, this is the
first time I'm vlogging today.
I've been so busy running all the
way to school, doing errands, and I've
just been like "ugh, I
feel exhausted today,"
I'm so exhausted, and it's only 1 o'clock.
I even had to run home for a few minutes,
and I literally took a 15 minute nap,
and then I had to get
out of the house again.
But I think I'm starting
to slow down a little bit,
I'm gonna go pick up Ollie now,
I think me and him are gonna
do a couple of fun things,
but yeah, it's just
been a crazy, crazy day.
I feel like if I drink
coffee, and literally
the only reason I don't drink coffee
is because it's just like gross to me,
but I could really use a coffee right now.
That would probably be
a really good pickup,
but anyways, we're off
to go pick up Ollie.
Ollie, that's you.
- Yeah, I made candy mat man.
- You made the mat man?
- Mhm.
And that's a boy mat man.
- That looks so neat.
I missed you.
- I missed you, too.
- Did you have a fun day at school?
- Yeah but-
- Oh, where'd your sticker go?
Oh no, he was so excited to
show you guys his sticker.
We found your sticker! He's so happy now.
- I've got a good garden here.
- You do have a good garden here.
Do you water these?
- Mmm.
- Other people do?
- Yeah.
- This is a very cool garden, though.
You guys are so cute.
Me and Ollie are getting
lunch at Freebirds,
it's like my favorite place.
- I'm gonna get a quesadilla.
- Yup, he's getting a quesadilla,
I'm getting a burrito,
I haven't eaten all day,
I'm so hungry, so we're
getting lunch together.
You know what we're
doing right now, right?
- What?
- We're having a date.
- Date?
- Yeah, me and you are going on
a little mommy, son date.
You know when you're on a date,
you have to pay for my
lunch, is that okay?
Can you pay for my lunch?
Do you have money?
- No.
- Huh, oh no, I'm gonna have
to pay for my own lunch?
Well, that's not a deal
breaker, but we'll see how
the rest of the date
goes and if it goes good
maybe I'll let you give me a kiss.
(Missy laughs)
Alright, you know what you're gonna get?
- Quesadilla.
- Okay, let's do it.
(bright music)
- So mama how was your day today?
- It was really good, how was yours?
- Um, good.
(Missy laughs)
(audience coo)
- This has been a really
special date, bud.
You have been so sweet during
this whole date, you know that?
(Fin smooching)
Huh, oh, you were supposed to ask!
(Fin laughs)
I love you, you're such a sweet boy.
Thanks for taking me on a little date.
- You're welcome.
I just wanna keep you forever, mama.
- You can keep me forever and ever okay?
(Missy laughs)
(bright music)
Okay, so I'm vlogging right now because
I really don't know what
to do at this point.
I'm so dumb, my brain has just been
like on overdrive all day, I've been
like really stressed out.
I knew I was getting low on gas
and I totally forgot and I ran out of gas,
and I ran out of gas on a really, really
scary hill on a really, really close
area and I have absolutely no service.
I was actually talking to my mom
at the time and I surprisingly
had service for longer than I usually do.
As I heard the phone
cutting out I was like:
"Oh my god, oh my god, mom, mom, mom
I ran out of gas, I ran out of gas,"
and I don't know what she
heard other than possibly,
"oh my god, oh my god, oh
my god, mom, mom, mom."
I don't even know what she heard.
She might be freaking out right now.
But I don't know what
to do, I'm on a really
scary hill, I've got Ollie in the backseat
which is really extra scary.
I don't really wanna get out of the car
and like walk, the road is not very
safe to walk on.
But I have no service, and I'm just hoping
that maybe she did hear me enough
to like send my dad to come get me,
but I don't know, no one even knows
where I am or what's going on,
I've never been like in a situation
like this and I'm so stressed.
I feel bad, Ollie's a little stressed out.
It's okay, baby, we're gonna figure
it out, okay?
- Okay.
- Don't worry, I feel so bad,
I probably should talk a little quieter.
Car is literally on a hill, on a scary
steep incline, and I'm completely out
of gas, and it is all my fault,
I feel so dumb, I'm so dumb.
I'm just kind of hoping like my dad
might have heard that I ran out of gas
but I don't know, we'll see.
(bright music)
Well, I just made it home.
That was really, really scary.
Someone actually ended up pulling over,
and knowing, like, we're on a road
where there's no service
and if I broke down
then I'd probably have
no way to contact anyone.
So, he drove me home, so my car's
still parked over there,
and I feel so silly.
Oh, I feel so dumb,
alright, I gotta tell Bryan.
Hey Bryan, um, our car's
parked on the side of the road.
- Umm, how'd that happen?
- I forgot that we ran out of gas.
- Hey, Ollie, did you run out of gas?
- Mhm.
- He's like "mama, what are you doing?"
- You couldn't give mama 5 bucks
to put in the gas tank?
(Missy laughing)
- Yeah this date really turned
out pretty crappy, Ollie.
(Missy laughing)
- It's alright, buddy.
So you guys had to walk here?
- No, we got a ride from someone.
- From who?
- Some person.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, it was so scary.
- Wait really?
- Yes!
(Missy laughing)
Yeah, we gotta go get my car.
So, I actually ended up calling my mom,
and she said all she heard was:
"oh my god, I forgot the-"
and so she thought I was saying like
"I forgot the-" like something silly.
But it's like "no, I forgot
the gas, I'm out of gas, mom!"
So she was just sitting there like:
"hmm, I wonder what she forgot,"
and I'm sitting on the
side of the road like:
"mom, come get me!"
But anyways, I'm gonna get this gas tank
and go fill it up and get my car.
We have lots of gas, too.
I don't know how I ran out, I'm so
absent minded, I guess.
- Alright, we are headed back to
see where Missy parked the car.
Papa to the rescue, he
was borrowing our truck,
and so he came and picked us up so we can
roll down and get the Volvo.
- Yeah.
- Crazy girl!
- It was so scary because
not having service,
like not having gas and no service
is like almost a nightmare.
- There's the car, stranded
on the side of the road.
- So, I couldn't decide like, what was the
safer route, walking home-
- Up the hill.
- Up the hill with my toddler on
a kind of scary road, or having someone
like pick us up.
- Trusting in someone, basically,
like what a nice guy, who just knew
you needed help and could kind of tell
like you have no service and stuff.
- And you can kind of tell,
like you have to get like a vibe from
someone like is this a good person
or is this a bad person?
- Alright, so let me know, what would
you guys do if you were
in a situation like this?
Let us know in the comments, would you
walk home on a scary
road with your toddler
or trust a stranger for help?
We live in one of those worlds where
it's hard to trust strangers, you know?
You definitely got lucky with the
stranger that you trusted today.
- I know. I was like:
"I'm gonna sit in the back with him,
and if I need to jump out of this car
I'm going to do it!"
(Missy laughing)
- Poor car, just needed a little juice!
(bright music)
What are we doing Ollie?
- Um, feeding the fish some bloodworms.
- You just fed them for the first time.
The loid is out.
- The loid's like, "what's up, dude!"
- No, no! You can't touch the glass.
(Missy and Bryan laugh)
- Yeah, you can't touch the glass, Fin.
I think we might be getting some
new fish tomorrow, boys.
- Really?
- Yeah they're coming by to maintenance
the tank, and they're gonna bring
us some new fish.
- Look at him, he's the coolest guy.
(electronic music)
- I'm gonna read this one because
the new Star Wars is coming out.
- Yeah it is!
- And you're a storm trooper.
- And you wanna read
'5-Minute Star Wars Stories,'
you're dressed as a storm trooper, right?
(Fin screaming)
- I wanna be that guy!
- You're gonna be Darth Vader when
we go see the movie?
- Yes!
- Yeah.
- And I'm gonna have a lightsaber.
- You are?
- Yeah.
- Nice.
Mama getting you boys ready for bed?
I love his hair all slicked back
like that, it's so cute.
- I like Finn the Star Wars guy.
- Finn? Yeah, Finn and BB-8, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Who's what?
- That.
- That is Obi-Wan Kenobi, I believe.
- I thought it was Ollie.
- No, I don't know if there is an Ollie.
- If that's Finn, where's Ollie?
(Bryan laughs)
- There should be an Ollie in the
Star Wars universe, huh?
- Alright, you ready to put some
lavender on your ears?
- Ooh.
- Oh, it tickles.
- And some-
- Some on your feeties!
(Fin screaming)
- On your other feet, don't touch it Fin.
- You want some on your feet Ollie?
Ollie loves the way it smells.
(Ollie laughing)
Smell your feet, now smell your feet!
What's it smell like?
Lavender, it smells like.
(Fin laughing)
- Aw.
Today was crazy, that was so funny.
Missy forgot to put gas in the car,
broke down, she had to get driven to home
by a stranger, and then we had to
go back and get the car.
It's always a good time with Missy,
she keeps life interesting,
that's for sure.
