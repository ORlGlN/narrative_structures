up the stairs
no forget your bra it was like this okay
we went to school in like a three-story
high school went to school in a
three-story building and our classes
were three always in like the opposite
you know levels like like we'd have to
do like two flights of stairs yeah to
get to one class I'm sure people even
know this
Brian would drag me up with with their
hand and go like this and walk up I
don't remember that yeah Louise I pulled
you up the stairs and you think it was
so prominent that other people who went
to high school with us remember that
I've been just going Jessica if you
