- No, she can't hold you!
She's too little.
He's like, "Maybe she can hold me."
Ahh, Finn really wanted
to hold June (laughs).
He tried sitting in her lap
but that didn't really work.
♫ This is our life
♫ This is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream
♫ This is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine

♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
-  Good morning!
- Look who's here!
Pay and Liv are helping us start the vlog.
-  Good morning!
- It is school today.
He's acting like...
-  Like an old man.
- Yeah.
He actually, I woke him up this morning,
he was like, "Can I just stay
in bed a few more minutes."
Which is unusual for him.
I think he's tired this morning.
Are you tired this morning?
You're never tired in the morning.
Are you tired in the morning?
- No!
- No?
(laughs)
These kids are excited for school.
I don't know why.
Alright, go have fun at school, okay?
- Okay!
- Mwah!
Be good!
- Okay.
- Alright, I just dropped off Ollie
and he was so excited for school!
I think he really missed his
teacher and all his friends.
I'm off to the gym.
Me and Kelsey always go to the gym,
especially on days where I drop off Ollie.
I'm really super excited
because today we're going
to The Rock Gym, but today we're bringing
a couple extra people with
us and we're super excited.
Natalia and Hannah are coming with us
and we're going to do some rock climbing
and I think it's gonna be a ton of fun.
We did rock climbing last
week for the first time
and it was so hard but so fun
and surprisingly I was not in
that much pain the next day.
So, it's not something that
you're like, "Oh gosh, I'm
gonna be like, in pain, for
a week after I rock climb."
So, I'm really looking forward
to some rock climbing time and all that.
Let's do it!
Alright we're all here and we're
getting ready to rock climb.
(cheers)
It's their first time so
(laughs) it should be fun!
It's really hard, our arms...
We already did one run.
- I'm like already tired.
- And we're like cramped up already.
- I am too.
(laughter)
That one's a hard one Hannah.
I can't believe you did that one (laughs).
- I know!
Alright, we're gonna
go for this one again.
(inspirational music)
Oh, that was hard!
I did only the greens.
I touched one black one.
My arms are shaking now.
Tal, that one's a hard one!
(both laugh)
It's like, it's like impossible.
You can do it!
Hannah has to jump now (laughs)!
Kelsey you can do it!
They're all struggling!
(laughing)
- That's it, now I'm down!
-  It's hard (laughs).
(upbeat music)
Alright, I am home now and we had
so much fun at The Rock Gym.
I am so sore, I feel like my arm muscles
are like completely cramped
and just like, stuck,
like they just hurt so bad.
Um but, I found that last time we climbed,
the next day I was really not that sore.
And I definitely felt like we were,
for sure, stronger this time, even though
we'd only done it one time before.
So yeah, it's just really cool to know
that next time we go, we're just
gonna get better and
better, and I already felt
like I was able to do a couple of climbs
that I would've not been
able to done the first time.
So, I don't know of it
was just my confidence
or if it is muscle, but it feels good.
Anyways, I'm home now
hanging out with Finn
while Bryan gets some work done.
I still gotta get ready for the day.
Yeah, I think it's gonna be a fun day!
(happy music)
- Hello guys, I am headed
in to get a hair cut today.
Um, I have an event in LA
the next couple of days
and it has been a little
nuts to take care of.
So that's on the agenda today.
And then I get to pick
up Ollie from school
which I'm really excited about.
Maybe I don't have to go
in and get a hair cut.
You know, maybe I could save some time
and just snap my fingers
and see what happens.
(snap)
Boom, there we go!
Check it out you guys.
Sure saved me a lot of time.
Now I can just go pick
up Ollie from school
and not have to worry about it.
Everyone needs a little
YouTube magic in their life.
If you guys had YouTube magic,
what would you use it for?
Leave a comment down below and let me know
cause I think that'd be
super funny to read through.
Hey Ollie!
- Hey.
-  How was school?
- Good.
-  Hey, you know what I saw?
- What?
-  You guys have a very
good looking garden over here.
This is so neat, huh?
- Yeah!
-  Do you know what you're growing?
- What?
-  It looks like you're
growing Lemon Balm and Snapdragon.
- Look there's flowers for Mama!
-  Yeah!
Yellow Bell Peppers even.
That's so cute.
- Yeah.
- So did you have a good day at school?
- Yeah!
- Yeah?
Are you ready to go home?
- Mmhmm, look at my shirt I have Goofy on!
- Goofy, that's Pluto! (laughs)
- Oh yeah!
- Goofy's also a dog though.
Alright, let's go kiddo.
I missed you!
- I missed you too!
- Hey Ollie?
- What?
- Remember when we did
the pumpkin spice thing?
And we tried all that
weird pumpkin spice stuff?
Well, get ready cause
we're doing it again!
Daddy found some cool
pumpkin spice things.
(laughs)
Someone's excited!
Check these out, Babe!
Pumpkin pie flavored chips!
- I actually really want to try these.
-  Corbin you
have to try these too.
- Yeah, I'm really intrigued with, what?
-  Pumpkin spice chips!
- Like a pumpkin pie!
- That is insane.
-  What is the world coming to?
I've also got pumpkin spice...
What is this, cider?
- Sparkling cider?
-  Yeah.
- That I'm excited about!
-  That looks good.
- That looks really good.
-  Boys, I got pumpkin Pop Tarts!
How cool is that?
You like Pop Tarts, huh?
- I don't like those ones anymore.
-  You don't want to try the...
He's like, "I'm done trying
pumpkin spice things Dad."
And then I also found pumpkin spice OREOs.
-  Oh!
-  Hey!
-  I don't wanna try those!
-  There the golden
OREOs, so they have the golden
cookies and the cream.
-  You want to try the OREOs?
Oh no?
-  You want to try the cookie?
- No!
-  No?
(laughter)
-  He just copies his brother.
-  Finn just copies
whatever Ollie says it's so funny.
- He's like, "What are we doing today?"
"Nope, we're not doing that."
(laugh)
- Alright, open these pumpkin pie chips.
I have to try these.
This is the weirdest pumpkin spice thing
I think I've ever found or encountered.
- Can you get it?
- Okay, I'm really weak.
- Strength!
Muscles!
- From today I can't really
like, even close my hands.
- Missy went rock climbing.
Oh, there we go!
- Oh!
- Hmm, interesting.
It just smells like potato.
- Yeah.
-  I can smell the potato
but I can definitely smell the...
-  Yeah, it kind
of smells barbecue-y.
-  Oh wow, that's weird.
- Pumpkin spice chips.
- Here we go.
(crunching)
-  Hmm.
-  Why?
- I'm not really a fan, uh-uh.
- I'm not a fan of chips.
- It's just, it's weird
cause you're eating a chip
and it's not salty, it's sweet.
- It's sweet, it's like a
sweet chip, but it's not...
- I don't know, I kind of like it.
-  You're so weird.
Missy hates chips, you guys.
-  Weirdo!
- She's eating pumpkin
spice flavored chips.
- I don't think I would eat them normally,
but I don't really eat chips normally,
but it's an interesting flavor.
-  Yeah.
- It's not disgusting.
- It's weird, it's too weird.
Alright, how about a pumpkin spice OREO.
- Yeah.
-  Oh!
- Let's do this, this looks good.
- This one I'm not gonna
like, it's too fall.
-  Honestly,
they kind of look weird.
-  You take an OREO and you make it
blonde and that's just not cool.
- Missy's not a fan of the golden.
Pumpkin spice OREOs!
(crunching)
- I like that!
I would sit and eat like
a whole box of these.
- Oh, um, I wouldn't eat them,
but they're not disgusting.
-  There not horrible!
There definitely not horrible.
I think they'd be good
with a chocolate cookie.
- I need milk.
- Mm, yeah.
-  And milk.
Hey Finn, you want a cookie?
- Yeah!
(chuckles)
-  Try that cookie
and tell me what you think.
Well, what do you think?
- Good.
-  Good?
(little kid talk)
- You wanna try it Ollie?
- No!
(laugh)
- I was like, "If it's a taste test video,
I'm gonna check out now."
Now we're gonna try pumpkin spice
flavored apple and pumpkin juice blend.
-  Oh, yum.
- I don't know if I can try this one
because it's carbonated.
-  No.
- It might be sparkling.
Let's see how it fizzes.
-  Nice and bubbly.
-  Oh wow!
That's a lot of fizz.
-  Oh!
- Wait, I'm gonna smell it.
-  Good?
- Um, it smells like
pumpkin, it's kind of weird.
- Oh, that's weird!
Yeah, like it smells like raw pumpkin...
-  Yeah.
-  Ew.
- Filling.
- It's not bad.
-  No?
- It's not good.
-  Does it have apple?
- Yeah the apple's good.
- Probably with it cold,
it might be better.
- This is like really
disheartening, you think
that everything pumpkin spice
would be good, but it's weird!
Sometimes it's weird.
You try it.
- Yeah I want to try it.
I don't like that.
It's like a spice cider.
-  Yeah!
- I think if it was just
pumpkin it would be fine.
- Now we have Pop Tarts,
pumpkin spice Pop Tarts.
-  I don't think it can go wrong.
- Look at that glorious
orange food coloring.
(laughter)
It's pretty good right?
(laughter)
-  Strawberry is them?
- No strawberry!
- Um, it's pretty good!
- This is pretty good!
-  Yeah?
- This is probably the best pumpkin spice
thing that I've had.
You want to try it Finn?
- Yeah, I don't think you
can go wrong with a Pop Tart.
- No.
- Finn's got a chocolate chip cookie,
pumpkin OREO, and a pumpkin Pop Tart.
-  He's like, "Dang!"
- He's like, "I love taste test videos!"
(happy and peaceful music)
I think it's safe to say Finn
loves taste test challenges.
But if you guys want to
see the first time we did
this challenge where we tried a bunch
of weird pumpkin spice things,
I'll have linked in the add card.
These ones are definitely weirder
like OREOs and chips, that's just weird.
- Alright guys, so yesterday
Bryan asked the question,
where everyone was from
that watches our vlogs
and we got so many comments, huh?
Tons of people telling
us where they're from
in the world and I was looking
at this map and I thought
it would be really fun to
read some of those comments
and show Ollie where some people are from.
Like there's just people from
all over the world watching us
and I think it's really cool to be able
to connect to you guys like that.
Alright, I've recruited
my dad so we can read them
together, cause I'm like,
I don't have enough hands.
Okay, let's see, so we've
got Jason in Colorado.
Which is right there, and you know
you live right here, right?
-  There's Colorado.
- Yep.
We've got Georgia Gellar
from the Philippines.
So where's the Philippines at?
Oh, there's the Philippines!
That is so far away!
-  You live over here.
-  How cool is that?
- They live over here.
- Or you can go the other way.
- They live on the
other side of the world!
Alright, the next one is from Smiley Alice
and she is from Norway!
Know where Norway is?
Oh yeah, there it is!
Oh!
-  Right there.
-  They live next to Sweden.
-  So you live over here a
and they're way over there.
That's so far away!
- Ollie's like, "I am so tired."
He's like, "I do not, I don't
have the energy for this."
- We've got Ashna from New Zealand!
Oh, New Zealand is all the
way in this little tiny area.
That is so far!
- Can you point to your place?
You're way over there.
-  Yeah!
You're over there!
-  They love way over here!
- In New Zealand!
And then, I'm gonna do one
more, and its from Cool Girl
and she lives in the Cayman Islands.
- Can you show where Cayman Islands is?
- Which is really neat.
That's not the Cayman Islands.
-  It's right here.
-  The Cayman Islands
is over they live near
like Jamaica and basically
the, what is that,
that's the, uh, Caribbean Sea.
So neat!
- Close to Florida.
- I love reading.
- That's your favorite place.
- Yeah (laughs).
I just love reading all the different
areas that people are from.
But anyways, this kid is so ready for bed.
Look who's over tonight!
We got baby June, huh?
We're babysitting.
Are you being a good helper babysitter?
(laughs)
We have June tonight because
it is Kelsey and Corbin's
anniversary and I thought
that it would be really cool
if they got to actually
go out on a real date
and I get to have baby June!
Are you hanging out with Aunty Missy?
It's been going pretty good so far.
(screams)
She's um, discovering life with brothers.
Keep that away from her face.
And I'm discovering life
with three children.
Which is crazy...
Definitely not ready yet.
- Why?
(laughs)
These boys, there a
little crazy still huh?
Huh, aww!
She loves giving kisses.
Bryan is headed out of town, so we
are gonna really really miss him.
But tomorrow we have a fun day planned,
but for now these boys
have to get some sleep.
Aww, are you holding hands
with June, petting her?
These boys are like infatuated with her.
Are you gonna give her a kiss?
Oh no, she can't hold
you, she's too little!
He's like, "Maybe she can hold me."
Hey Finn, do you want to
hold June for a minute?
Aww (laughs)!
Finn really wanted to hold June.
(chuckles)
He tried sitting in her lap
but that didn't really work.
So now he's holding her.
Alright, Ollie, and Finn, and June,
you guys ready to end the vlog?
- Yeah!
- Yeah?
Give the video a big thumbs up!
Yeah, say, "we'll see you tomorrow!"
(laughs)
- Bye!
-  Say, "Boop!"
Boop!
Boop.
(upbeat music)
