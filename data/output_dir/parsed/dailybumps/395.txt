weather as you guys know I've been
letting the chicken hang outside a lot
lately because it's been super nice and
pleasant Luna hasn't been here the past
two days they can be out more because
Luna is little puppy it doesn't really
know to leave the chickens alone so they
spent a little bit more time in their
coop since Wibbly plays outside a lot
I'm hoping when Luna gets back she'll be
like she won't need to like chase the
chickens as much and they can be out a
little bit more often so anyways problem
is they hang out so much outside I'm
nowhere lingering because we have it on
eggs about whoa there's you okay you

called oh okay just whatever mrs. doing
arts and crafts by the way for the baby
shower but both kids fell asleep on the
way here which was the baby we're like
yes and they are now in bed and we seen
I've just been enjoying our night
working on different things she's
working on supper preparing for the baby
shower and I am painting my kitchen with
Lloyds you guys know that I am obsessed
with automating my house and adding cool
lights to my house and basically just
obsessed with Philips he'll and I'm not
sponsored but Philips if you're watching
I should totally be your spokesperson
because I love Philips hue lights but
I've been wanting to do like under
cabinet under the cabinet lighting for a
while because we've had houses with it
before and it's just really cool it adds
like a really cool effect to your
kitchen so I found the Philips light
strip and I put those all under there
and then I took a bloom light and put it
there so it kind of like accent that
night as well and then I set it all up
so that main kitchen remote when you
change this one it changes under the
cabinet lighting as well so like during
the evening we like it a little orange
or light and then you have dim and you
have like a nightlight we can make it
all pink if you want to that's kind of
cool but also kind of nauseating and you
could shows all off if you want to as
well and then for the second remote this
is just those three lights so we can
turn on just under the cabinet light
which is really nice for like at night
and we can also do like some cool colors
at night - really like pink at night
it's just very soothing and then I can
control the brightness of it so it's
cool we just got some cool new gadgets
so yeah that's been super fun to work on
and I had to be a little tricky with
that light especially it actually goes
behind that cabinet and I had to get it
at it I said I got the top step and I
must die anyway so Missy just uploaded
