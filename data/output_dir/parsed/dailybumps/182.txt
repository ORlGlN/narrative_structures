- Ollie, should we tell them the big news?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- All right, I think we're
going to tell you the big news.
- We're moving!
♫ This is our life
♫ This is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream
♫ This is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield
♫ And we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand
♫ And watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
- Good morning!
- Good morning.
- Good morning guys.
We are up quite early today.
Well, I wouldn't say up any earlier,
but we have left a lot earlier today,
because today is a very special day,
and I don't think Ollie
even really knows why,
but it's a couple reasons.
One, it's a school day.
So that's always good.
Next, it's share day,
and the letter is "B",
so what are you bringing to school
to share with your friends?
- Buzz Lightyear.
- Buzz Lightyear!
- And he has a laser.
- Yeah, and not just any Buzz Lightyear,
I went ahead and got the ones
down that we usually have
up as decoration,
because it's kind of like
a really nice one, and so
I thought that would be
fun to show his friends and share.
The other reason it is an exciting day,
is because today at his school,
they're celebrating everyone's
birthday, including yours.
They're going to have like a
little birthday celebration
at school for all the kids.
My job is to bring mini cupcakes,
and I went to the store yesterday,
and I forgot the mini cupcakes,
so now I have to leave extra early,
go to the store, get those mini cupcakes.
So, we're going to go get cupcakes,
and then head to school,
and then they're going have
their little birthday celebration.
I'm excited for you. (laughs)
All right, we're headed into the store.
What kind of cupcakes do you want?
- I want fire ones.
- Fire ones?
I don't know if they're selling fire ones.
I think I found them.
All right, so I ended up going
with win these mini ones,
because they seemed more mini,
but I only needed 12,
and 12 comes in this,
and I didn't want to get just one flavor,
so we got triple chocolate cupcakes,
and red velvet cupcakes.
All right, you got your Buzz?
Pretty excited to share him?
- Yeah.
-  Show me what this guy does.
(Buzz makes laser sounds)
His little head moves.
Pretty cool, huh?
- Buzz Lightyear,
reporting for sector duty.
- Oh my goodness!
So I officially feel so silly.
I spent all morning
getting these cupcakes,
and the party isn't until next week.
So, yeah, now I've got 24 cupcakes.
Hopefully they'll last until next week,
or maybe I'll have to buy some more,
but I did want to tell
you guys this cute story.
I just dropped off Ollie,
and his teacher was so
excited to pull me over
and show me this picture
that she took of Ollie.
I think I can show you guys it right here.
She goes, "He was so excited to show me
"that he drew an H," and she was like,
"I can't believe he actually drew an H."
I don't think most preschoolers
are just drawing H's.
And then the little boy
next to him saw Ollie do it,
and so that little boy did it too,
and he was so proud of himself,
and she was so proud of him,
and I'm just like, "Oh!"
He actually drew an H the
other night at the restaurant,
and I posted it on my
Insta-Story, and I was like,
"Oh my gosh."
He didn't do it on accident.
He's like, "Look Mama, I made an H."
And I was like, "Oh my gosh, you did."
It's just pretty cool.
It's really fun to see
him going to preschool,
is actually like...
Things are clicking. I don't know.
I think he's actually going
to learn things in preschool,
which, I just always
thought preschool was like,
more fun, and kind of get them
into the routine of things,
I didn't really think of it
as like, "Oh, he's going to
learn like, things," and he really is,
so it's really, really cool,
and I'm just really proud of him.
Anyways, I'm now off to Kelse's house.
I think we're going to
do a little workout,
and then we have not a...
We actually have a pretty nice day.
I don't think it will be super busy,
so I'm going to go do that.
I'm home with my other little baby boy.
How are you this morning?
- Oh, Mama.
- Yeah, Mama.
I've gotta be honest.
I have been loving taking
Ollie to school in the morning,
and spending that time with him and stuff,
and then coming home and
getting to spend like,
one-on-one time with Finn.
It's just been really, really
neat, and pretty cool huh?
You get time with Mama?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. (laughs)
But I think me and him
are actually going to go
in the hot tub, because
my body is so sore,
I'm just like, "Ow, ow, ow!"
It hurts so bad.
It is a chilly, chilly day today,
and we're all ready to go swim.
It's actually weird, oh it's sprinkling.
I mean, it's not...
It's misting, I guess you can say,
because I can see it on the water,
but it feels really nice.
And then check out over here.
We got this fixed.
I think Bryan showed this to
you guys yesterday, but, yay!
Looks like it's still drying.
Don't get paint on your foot.
Finn, you just look so
cute right there. (laughs)
I'm just watching him.
This hot tub just feels
so good on my muscles.
Oh, they hurt so bad.
We're just going to hang out
in here for a little bit,
then we're going to go get, actually,
you're going to go take a nap.
Sound good?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
All right, me and Kelse are
off to get our hair done,
but first we're actually
picking Ollie up from school,
because Bryan is working
really hard trying to get
stuff done, and everyone else is busy,
so he has to be picked up,
and come to the salon with us.
- Yay! It's going to be so fun for him.
- He's going to love it.
He actually loves the salon, so he might,
actually, be excited.
- Oh, good.
- I'm excited to see him.
(upbeat pop music)
- Um, okay, I tried everything
to get this kid to wake up,
and he is so out.
- (Kelse laughs)
- So I guess I'll just
carry him to the car myself.
Look who's up!
You were sleeping so good at school, huh?
You got your Buzz?
Did everyone like your share toy?
- Mm-hmm.
- Did they all want to play with it too?
- Yeah.
- So I am going to get my hair
done at Michelle's new place,
which is actually the same
place that Ollie gets his
haircut done with Travis, huh?
So he walked in, he was so excited
because he gets to see Travis,
and he's just hanging out
on the couch with his
Buzz, happy as can be.
He hasn't even come to sit next to me.
He's like, "I'm just going
to sit next to Travis."
So, pretty cute.
Love you.
And this is such a cool salon.
Michelle works here now, too.
And it's so fun.
(deep dance beat)
- And we're done!
- Yay! Fresh hair.
- Yeah.
I went a little bit darker,
kinda just like, rich-ed
it up a little bit.
-  It looks nice.
- Yeah, I feel like it just
makes it feels a little more
healthier, and look healthier,
so I'm happy, and Ollie was so good.
You were so good.
- Mm-hmm.
- You just played with your Buzz,
he didn't watch a movie,
he didn't make a peep.
He just loved the fact that he was there,
and Travis was there,
and he would just go over
and talk to him randomly.
It was so cute.
So I think now, we're going
to go get some ice cream
real quick, and then
we're going to head home.
(bright pop music)
- Oh hey guys.
So I have been working all day,
and Missy and the boys just got home.
I'm looking for them.
What are they doin'?
You guys hanging out in my office?
- Yeah.
- We're watching this movie.
-  What's the
movie you're watching?
- Secret Life of Pets.
-  That's right.
Cool shirts, dude.
Can you show me?
- It's a dinosaur.
-  Whoa, you've got
a dinosaur with a city!
And you've got Batman and Robin?
Finn is wearing a Lego
Batman shirt that Ollie was
originally wearing when he got home,
and he could not even cope,
so we had to put it on Finn, and look.
It actually kind of fits.
It's kind of like a dress, but yeah.
You boys are so cute.
Boys are home!
I've missed them.
I've missed you guys.
- Mm-hmm.
-  Love you.
So we may actually have a
little surprise for you guys.
Ollie, should we tell them the big news?
- Yeah.
- Yeah!
- All right, I think we're
going to tell you the big news!
- We're moving!
- Ha!
Yes.
Well, as in, we're...
They are. (laughs)
-  I mean, it's moving day.
- It's moving day for the family.
- So yeah, we have had a
top-secret project going on.
My parents have moved, and it's so crazy.
I'm actually really excited about it.
They're going to have a lot more room,
so we can hang out more.
- Mm-hmm.
- Because the other house was just
a little bit more cramped,
and there really was
no room for the kids,
and they really wanted
a space that so that
the kids can come over
and spend the night--
- Look at how much room there is, though.
-  Yeah, look at this.
We're going to have to do
like, a full house tour soon.
It literally is moving day today.
- Today's the day.
- So they're unpacking.
I'm going to unpack some boxes,
and get everything set up.
I'm so excited, you guys.
This is crazy.
Look at this! (gasp)
Oh, and what's in here?
(gasp) Kids!
- Aah!
- Finn's the police officer
and he got me in here.
-  Oh, is this
your guys's play room?
- Yeah!
- Yeah, it's so cool.
- This is literally a cupboard
under the stairs right now.
-  I know.
It's so cute.
I love it.
You get your own little play room.
- I'm actually tied up.
-  Oh, you are tied up.
- I seriously love these floors.
-  I know! This is my favorite.
- Can we do this in the house?
- I want this in our house for sure.
- That would be so fun.
-  So nice.
-  Is this real wood?
- No, it's not.
- It looks so good.
- I know, it even has the grains.
It's really nice.
This house is so fun.
We're excited to make it a home, I guess.
But, super fun, and it's moving day
so we've got to start unpacking.
(subdued pop music)
- Let's go check out the upstairs.
So, what's really cool about up here is,
there's a fun little loft space,
which actually goes out
to a little balcony,
which is cool, but this
will be a cool place
for the kids to hang out as well.
Someone's reunited with the kitty!
(Ollie and Finn scream excitedly)
- Who's your best friend?
Who's your best friend?
- Kitty.
-  Is this Zuri?
- Yeah, this is our best friend.
-  Yeah, I love-love!
-  (laughs) I
don't know if that love
goes both ways, bro.
She's like, "Stop touching me."
- She only has eyes for one person,
and that person is my brother.
-  That is Uncle.
She loves him. (laughs)
-  She adores Jimmy, and--
-  Ollie, not so much.
- She tolerates everyone else.
-  Yeah, basically.
I can't believe she's
even letting you hold her.
-  I know. She's not happy.
-  She's actually not...
She doesn't scratch like
crazy when you hold her,
she just looks really uncomfortable.
- She's just like, "I just
want you to let me go."
She's got the most personality though.
-  Yeah, she's so soft.
-  My brother takes her on walks.
-  (laughs)
-  Like, actual walks.
She's got toys, and she
runs around this house
like she owns the place,
but she will only come to my brother.
-  Aww.
(bright pop music)
-  What did you find, Ollie?
- Treats for kitty cat.
-  Nice.
Who's got a little treat for you?
-  Aww.
Oh, she ran away.
-  There you go.
Say hi.
- Hello.
-  Say, "We're going nigh-night!"
- 'kay!
-  Come read a book.
- 'kay.
(burbles)
-  I have the Star Wars toy, Finn.
(Finn makes baby talk)
(Ollie makes whispering monster noises)
-  That is some
pile of books there, boys.
- I told them three books.
-  That's five.
- And this is like, 10.
-  Yeah. (laughs)
Finn, you're just doing some
light reading before bed?
- Yeah.
-  We've got Goodnight, Moon.
We've got Words.
My Little Animal Book.
Lookit, this one's got animals.
- What?
- Yeah. Isn't that cool?
- Be bear? Aah!
- You guys, sorry my Ninjago robot,
um, just broked.
-  He did break, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
-  Aww.
Looks like it could be
an easy fix, though.
Yeah, not too bad.
-  Come on, Ollie.
Let's come read these books.
-  Hop on there.
Read a book with Mama.
- You want me to read to you, Bub?
- Yeah.
- Okay, come sit down.
-  Come on heaters, warm up.
It's so cold out here.
The kids are in bed, and it
is not even nine o'clock.
Yay! Luna is out here playin'.
She's having a blast.
It's 60 degrees!
I know that everyone's going
to say, "That's not cold!
"You shouldn't say how it's cold!"
I know it's not freezing, but it's cold.
It's chilly.
My heaters are turning on.
It's a nice night.
When it's freezing outside,
the pool looks really nice.
I think I might actually
get in the hot tub,
or me and Bryan might get in the hot tub.
So, by the way, if you guys don't know,
our brand new song now has a lyric video
up on our channel.
Make sure you go check it out.
It'll be linked up in the iCard,
and we are so excited.
Now you guys can know the words,
you can memorize it, and
sing it along with us.
It's just such a fun song.
I mean, every time we get in the car,
Ollie makes me put it on.
He's so cute though, because
he sings all the words,
and he loves when his part comes
because he screams it and yells it.
It's so cute.
I'll have to vlog it some time.
Anyways, for now we're going
to go ahead and end the vlog.
You want to help me end it?
Say, "Give the video
a big thumbs up, guys.
"Yeah, thumbs up, and we'll
see you guys tomorrow.
"Bye!"
Boop.
(upbeat pop music)
