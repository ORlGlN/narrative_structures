isn't that cool he pound for that leg
yeah pound for dick look how lazy is he
crashes out in his chair good morning
guys this morning has been slightly
hectic because our fridge has been
actually acting really weird the past
couple of days and so we ended up having
to order a new one just because our food
was not staying cold enough and we were
just getting like a little bit of a
weird vibe from it especially cuz we
actually got it off Craigslist so it's
just always been kind of weird so
anyways we got a new fridge and so all
of our food has been out this is all our
food from our fridge this is all our
food from our freezer and this is
actually our new fridge it's a lot like
the other one a little bit different
actually it's kind of a cool lighting
you can tell and I'm trying to get all
our food in here quickly as possible but
it's also not even cold enough it's
actually getting cold pretty quickly so
that's nice I'm just trying to get all
this food in here before it all goes bad
I don't want all our food to go to waste
and after getting all this food out of
my old fridge I realized we have a lot
of food we we yell this food what the
heck Holly are you having a rough time
your teeth are bothering you huh you
hear that he said yeah we made him a
little lunch of grilled cheese he's
finally eating some of the chips but
maybe he'll eat more he has been having
a very tough time with his teeth lately
we've seen him he was actually chewing
on his arm earlier this morning
which were so sex he was leaving marks
in his arm but his teeth were hurting
him so much so this is molars oh really
yeah I went yesterday to get him the
step to Robby thing oh yeah
ones that go right here but I could not
find this up to anywhere ot4 hurt him
like I need a cold one dad forget
everything like oh he just looks
miserable buddy yeah we are making some
grilled cheesus like Jesus grilled
cheesus he's I was going to put ham on
them but our ham was not smelling very
good some other hand we're the Canadian
bacon that I used for Eggs Benedict
yeah yeah I really like this yeah it's
like a separate drawer you can make it a
separate temperature than the fridge
we're just going to put all our drinks
in it so they stay nice and cool it's
pretty cool like when he gets older it
might be a good place to stick like some
snacks or things that he wants to grab
out of here
yeah like little applesauce cups or
something yeah really nice we have so
much more room I think now that we can
put like the big things over here you
know yeah all right karma is getting
pampered today he's getting a little bit
of a haircut and he's being kind of
crazy about it hey be careful Karma how
do you look Carmen hey Kim good time
we look hairy that's what you look like
commented so good when I just took him
to the groomer he didn't like kind of
put up a fight like he has been and I
actually been doing this thing called
Zoom groom which basically instead of
keeping your dog all day long to do like
a grooming which I don't know why they
need to keep your dog that long but um
they only keep him for like the amount
of time that he is needed there so it's
like an hour so that's been nice because
I feel like it tends to stress him out
when he's there for like hours at a time
but I got there and I guess my boy was
thirty minutes ago even though they told
me two o'clock and that's what I had in
my phone so apparently they can't do
that so it'll be like a couple hours
till he's done which kind of sucks it's
not too much longer sometimes they'll
keep him for like four to six hours I'm
like why do you need my dog for four or
six hours I don't get it I'm gonna go
grab a couple things for all I since
he's teething at the store and I had to
finally give in to a really weird
craving of mine that I've been happening
it's really weird okay here it is Top
Ramen beef flavored I haven't had this
in years like I literally have not
craved Top Ramen in so long apparently
that's what the baby want so I'm like
all right I guess Ritz crackers so I
just had a really really interesting
conversation with a Spreadshirt who
actually powers our merch shop if you
guys don't know when we did the charity
fundraiser in December we're actually
giving shirts to those who donated over
$100 and all those people have actually
submitted their information to get the
shirt but you probably have not received
it so this is a message to you guys if
you haven't received your shirt I was
actually working with a representative
at Spreadshirt and I had given her all
the orders that needed to go out you
know and I never heard anything from her
after the initial email and so finally
after asking for like an update for the
fourth time um I was actually got in
contact with the manager who was
involved there and she told me that she
quit and I was like oh okay well that
kind of makes sense so the manager
actually set everything up again and
sent out the order today so it's paid
for the orders are in
and they're being sent so if you were
supposed to get a shirt for the
fundraiser water of life charity you
should be getting it really really soon
and I'm really sorry to all of those
who've been waiting and wondering where
the heck is my shirt it's on its way I'm
just sitting here in my magic chair my
magic work chair getting things done
also what do you guys think about this
for a poster design spread sure came to
me and asked if we want to do posters
like signed or unsigned versions and so
I whipped this together and I think it
looks really slick and I know you guys
have been asking for posters for a long
time and we just haven't been able to do
it but if you are interested in posters

let me know if you like that design that
was on my iMac before it went dark there
