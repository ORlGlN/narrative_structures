- Alright boys you did such a good job
eating your breakfast you guys
want some Halloween candy?
-  Yeah.
-  Alright, come on, let's go see
all the candy you guys got yesterday.
- Okay.
(Bryan laughing)
-  Go sit on the
couch and we'll grab them.
You guys got two huge buckets
of candy yesterday didn't you.
- Yeah.
- So mommy and daddy
have a little confession.
We didn't eat dinner last night
and we were so hungry,
we ate all the candy.
-  I'm sorry
guys, we were so hungry.
-  We were just so hungry
and we didn't have any dinner.
Is that okay?
- No.
-  Finn, I'm sorry, we're so sorry.
-  It was really yummy.
-  We were just so hungry.
-  We were so hungry.
- We were so busy yesterday and we didn't
eat anything for food and we got home
and you guys were asleep and we're like
I guess we should just eat
all the candy, is that okay?
Are you really upset?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, Finn are you
okay, I ate all the candy.
-  It's all gone we ate it all.
-  All gone.
-  All of it.
-  Every single one.
-  What about Finn's, check
Finn's bucket Ollie, is it empty?
I'm sorry guys.
-  Is it okay, why do you
keep looking at me like that, are you mad?
- Yeah.
(Finn mumbles)
-  Yeah, we were so so hungry.
Is it okay that I ate the candy?
- Where that go, my candy.
-  No.
- No.
-  I feel so bad, I'm so sorry.
-  Sorry guys I'm sorry Ollie.
Do you forgive mommy and daddy?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
-  We do have one last piece
left in the calendar 'cause you didn't
eat your Halloween piece,
do you want that one?
- No.
-  No.
-  You're to sad to eat now?
- Yeah.
- Are you okay Finn, you weren't
letting your candy go yesterday.
(Bryan laughing)
-  Hey Ollie, guess
what, we're just kidding.
(Missy laughing)
-  Do you want me
to get you your candy?
-  We didn't eat your candy
buddy we wouldn't do that.
Jimmy Kimmel told us to
tell you that, I'm sorry.
(Bryan laughing)
Come here, hurry, hurry, hurry.
See we didn't eat your candy you guys.
We wouldn't do that.
- I want this.
(Missy laughing)
-  Skittles alright you guys
can each have one piece
before we go today okay?
- Finn you can have this.
-  Ooh do you want that one?
-  He gives him the grossest one.
- He's like no thank you.
Do you want a different piece?
Ooh Sour Patch Kids, alright good
pick boys sorry we tricked you.
-  Ollie would you have been
so sad if we actually ate it all?
- I want out.
- Now I'm happy.
-  Now you're happy
'cause you have candy?
- Yeah.
- Alright, Ollie did you
believe mommy and daddy
when we said we ate your candy?
Yeah, he was kind of
like in disbelief, yeah.
-  He kept looking at me like no.
(Bryan laughing)
- That was seriously so funny.
We got such a different reaction out
of them than I was kind of
thinking we were going to get.
But if you guys have not seen
last year when we did this prank
on Ollie I'll have the link in the bio.
He was definitely very upset last year.
This year he was kind
of like, super bummed.
And Finn was like, no that's not okay.
But I don't think he really
knows what's going on
so next year for Finn
will be really funny.
If you guys wanna know what next
year's gonna be like for Finn.
Watch last years prank because
pretty sure that's how Finn's gonna be.
