that time he's been doing this for every
single night since basically the day I
brought him home from the hospital and I
just say the splashes huh you think you
owe that fast fast he actually missed
his third nap so he's been a little bit
grouchy but no matter what like if he's
grouchy if I him in the back then he'll
be in a good mood and he'll be happy
while he's in there Moni
I did that smile hmm
so I just got ollie down so unless you
guys know we have a little dog Leo he's
a little chihuahua and he always goes
outside and he barks at this neighbor
dog I mean he goes crazy - it goes out
there and he barks and he bites the
fence really hard and I guess he also
will some tight like the dog will get
its feet like
a tiny bit under the fence and he'll
bite the dog's feet like go Creek goes
crazy every time it happens we run
outside and we have to go get leo
yesterday he was barking really loud and
all of a sudden he started crying and we
were already like running out there and
I start crying and he was bleeding on
his foot turns out it looked like he had
maybe ripped off his nail and so we're
like oh that looks bad so we wrapped it
up and put a little antibiotics on it
and stuff but it just wasn't getting
better and we were looking at today and
it just was looking really bad so we had
to take him my mom just took him to to
the vet and like it's an after our
clinic kind of thing turns out he
basically amputated his own thumb he
ripped off the padding that's like the
entire thing ripped it off and I'm
pretty sure he did it himself so yeah
they have to like put him down and kill
him surgery and staple it and clean it
and it's gonna be a build here hopefully
Leo's okay he'll be back later tonight
he's not saying that like overnight poor
little guy just bit his own freaking
thumb off it's kind of funny at the same
time like I can't believe that he did
that look at our cool bed you guys oh by
the way we learned you're supposed to
have three euro pillows back there so
now we have to find pillowcases for
three pillows as well as buy an
additional one so yay for more pillows
this is our life now babe Matt we are
married how many pillows can we get on
this bed watch this whoa oh my gosh oh
it's better so comfy like people don't
really take advantage of all the pillows
you have the pillows on it enjoy them
don't just look at them
so hey well I have you here I want to
tell you guys about something that
happened this morning
sorry guys yesterday my dad was planning
on calling me well he never did so it's
kind of like on edge today cuz I was
feeling like I might calling today and
then he called me this morning and we
had a chat and it was nice he was really
nice he was really polite and uh um we
talked about things nothing like too big
or deep or anything like that it was
cool to get to like talk to him and have
a first conversation with him I'd
imagined how that conversation would go
for a long time now and it went
nothing like that my family his family
is actually planning a huge barbecue at
the end of this month or the beginning
of next month to introduce us to
everyone and sort of have a big family
get-together so that should be fun he
was actually cool with like arranging
some sort of meeting like hanging out
before that and sort of getting to like
meet each other for the first time
before then - so I was kind of I don't
know I was kind of surprised by the
phone call it was really it was really
cool but anyway yes I had my first
conversation with my dad and it's weird
to say that because I have a dad now you
know we could go I didn't well I did I
guess but I wouldn't say I had one cuz I
didn't know I don't know this is weird
I'm new to it just like you guys are
just roll with that that's what happened
today so thanks for watching a lot give
a thumbs up if you did scribe right now
yeah all right I'll see you guys later
see this cool pillow you seen this
pillow at miss you got it has birdies on
it put a bird on it it's not something
that workers gonna be like oh hey we're
on YouTube check us out because it's
kind of something that's not very common
it is a little bit intimidating because
we're sharing about Brian's side of
things but it's technically about their
family and it's just I don't know it's
kind of us it's kind of a weird
situation - do they figure out Brian's
name they literally could just Google or
Facebook try and find them on Facebook
and they'd be like whoa what is this guy
doing you know
