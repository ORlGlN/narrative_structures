(cute, spooky music)
(children babbling happily)
-  Ollie, Finn, time
to go to the pumpkin patch!
Let's go!
(cute, spooky music)
- Whoa.
- Whoa!
- What's this?
- It seems to be
some kind of house.
(Zero barks)
- This is cool.
- Oh, Jack.
I don't know about this;
we shouldn't intrude.
- Nonsense, let's go!
(sweeping music)
(bouncy, spooky music)
Where's the coffin?
This bed's too comfy.
- They must really love to entertain.
They have so many ingredients for potions.
(Zero barks)
Jack, we really should be going.
I don't wanna intrude on these
nice people.
- Yes, I know.
Let's look at his master closet.
I bet it's so big!
(bouncy, spooky music)
(Jack and Sally screaming)
(Zero barking)
- Well, well, well, what have we here?
Trying to escape
Halloween Town again, huh?
- Oh no, it's Oogie Boogie!
- Run!
(dramatic chase music)
- I don't understand.
Where's Halloween Town?
All this running and I'm gonna pop a seam.
- Quick, in here, before Oogie gets us!
(screaming)
(gentle, pleasant music)
What's this?
- Welcome to Valentine Valley.
(gasps) Jack, I've heard of you!
Please don't steal our holiday.
- I will never do that again.
- That's a relief.
- We're being chased by Oogie Boogie.
We came here to hide.
(bouncy, spooky music)
- Hmm, where could they have gone?
Come on, bugs, follow me.
(gentle skittering)
- I think he's gone.
- Thanks for keeping us safe.
- No problem; that Oogie
Boogie must be taken care of.
Here, have a sucker.
(gentle music)
(Zero barks)
- We must find Halloween Town.
(screaming)
Oh, no, Sally!
We're coming to get you; come on, Zero!
(dramatic music)
(barking and screaming)
(bouncy, happy music)
- Oh, hmm, hello, sir?
(rabbit giggles)
- Oh no, Sally, are you okay?
- I'm okay, Jack.
- Nice to see you again, Easter Bunny.
I promise we won't kidnap you again.
Let's go, Sally.
(Zero barks)
- I don't understand,
where did our tree go?
- We're never gonna get home.
(sleigh bells jingling)
Santa Claus, so good to see you!
- What are you doing
out of your tree, Santa?
- I stumbled and fell and
landed here, ho ho ho.
I'm lost and Mrs. Claus is
making a pot roast tonight.
- We can help you, Sandy.
- Yes, we will.
We know this forest better than anyone.
Your tree is right over here.
- You a gambling man, Sandy Claws?
- Oh no, Oogie Boogie; jump!
(screaming)
(gentle Christmas music)
- I'm home!
Oh, thank you, Jack.
- You ain't going nowhere.
(laughs wickedly)
- Not so fast.
- Ella, my most loyal elf!
- That's right, Santa.
I'm not letting Oogie
Boogie get to you again.
Not this time!
(dramatic music)
- (gasps) Not my bugs!
(powerful whoosh)
(magic chime)
(gentle music)
- I know who would enjoy this very much.
Our pals Ollie and Finn!
I bet you they're missing
their other toys right now.
Now that Oogie Boogie's taken care of,
let's get you guys home.
(magic chime)
- We made it!
- It's good to be home.
(Zero barks)
- Happy Halloween to all
and to all a good fright!
(gentle music)
(doorbell rings)
(children talk excitedly)
- Hey, babe, did you get them those toys?
- No, I didn't; I
thought you ordered them.
- (laughs) No, it's not even Amazon.
Is that a Christmas box?
- Oh, you're right.
That's so weird.
- That's so weird!
(children playing happily)
(gentle spooky music)
And there you have it, you guys.
- Yay!
- Our Halloween special.
The boys are absolutely obsessed
with Nightmare Before Christmas,
so I knew we would have
to do this this year,
and they had such a blast filming,
and they loved it.
- Ollie loved being Jack.
I think that was the cutest thing ever,
and the fact that I made that Zero costume
for Finn is pretty cool.
- Super cool, yes.
Missy worked her butt off on that thing.
- Yeah, we had a lot of
fun, and I just wanted
to say a big thank you to my family
for always being so
willing to get involved,
(laughs) and get dressed up.
- Jimmy's like, "Sure,
I'll dress up like a
"Easter Bunny on a green screen."
- I know, my poor dad, it's like, actually
100 degrees out, he's just
like Santa Claus. (laugh)
- And special thanks to Corbin
for helping us film and
get everything organized.
Be sure to check out his channel.
Check out the iCard for last
year's Halloween special
and all of the other fun
ones that we've done.
It's something we like to do every year,
just to keep things interesting,
and the kids enjoy it, and we love
having these videos to
watch for years to come.
- Yeah, so much fun, we
love watching all the
first year (laughs) being pranked.
There was one that was so cute.
We've progressively gotten
a little bit better.
(both laughing)
And let us know down in the comments below
what was your favorite
character from the skit.
- That's right, and be
sure to give this video
a big thumbs up, share
it with all your friends
and family or anyone you
think would enjoy it,
because that helps out a ton.
Thanks so much for watching, guys.
We will see you manana, bye!
- Bye!
- Happy Halloween!
(energetic spooky music)
