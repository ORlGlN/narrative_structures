treats you already had one
come up here no that's a bad boy it's
kind of just been a lazy day today Missy
came home early because she wasn't
really feeling that at work I've been
sitting on the computer just trying to
like sort through our taxes we've kind
of just been lounging around we watched
a show but it's time to pick ourselves
up because feeling very like black so I
really want to go bowling to Kirk you
she is uh what is the fruit for your
bump date so we got it by a peach has to
be three inches what kind of peach is
three inches in the winter time is that
pretty big I mean that's like it's like
a Georgia Peach I don't know how big
Georgia peaches are
I think I saw peaches they were pretty
small mmm ice cream I'll think about it
yeah what do you think about going
bowling I'll think about that boy
you want your piggy you want to piggy
this he is inside doing her makeup she's
taking too long so playing with Karma

but something like that oh he's teaching
me how to open gum because I never do it
now
people open cigarettes I don't know
weird thank you oh it was good
it's minty right it's okay yeah sounds
fine I wanted to hit Govan I had to ask
her which one am I allowed to get she's
so weird about smells not just right now
cuz she's pregnant but all the time
because she's the pickiest person in the
world huh yeah so the peaches at the
grocery store look nasty so we're headed
to little farm stand they probably got
better-looking stuff at least this is a
coolest little like produce place

- we get pregnant like three months
later anything all this stuff would be
right home honey

sixteen bucks for little slice of their
home we're not getting the nectarines

were mmm
anywhere close to being like three
inches and then I got snap peas cuz I
hear those are really good to eat with
hummus Monday's Snoopy's is snow peas

I got hummus from that fresh and easy
place and it is not good I just got the
normal fresh and easy brand classic
hummus and it was just disgusting it
tasted like there was mustard in it so

boxing gloves because we have this
really cool idea for Missy's new video
is to have her have boxing gloves on and
sort of like be punching out the first
trimester cuz she's all done with that
now so we here at Walmart trying to find
some that's so cool

kind of colors too you know like she's
trying to put it away
