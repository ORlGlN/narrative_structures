pretty excited about it and I'm so
thankful and I was actually able to do
that I've been really wanting one for a
really long time and it was just so cool
to be able to kind of live out my
childhood something that I got to do a
loss of a funny story I had Ollie in the
go-cart with me and had a little
flashback of when I was a kid I was
riding my old go-kart which was really
really old it was very like just the
bare bones of a go-kart but my favorite
thing ever and I had my sister I feel
like she was about always age she was
riding next to me this thing had no
seatbelts whatsoever and I was going
pretty fast and I remember she just blew
out of the go-kart and she was totally
fine not even a scratch but I remember
like not even knowing I didn't even know
that she was not in the car tomorrow I
looked over and I was like where is she
and I look behind me and she's just like
gone
and so I thought it's not gonna happen
we were just having fun and luckily she
did get her but I had like this
flashback of when my sister fell out of
the go garden like holding your stuff in
races but yeah we had a lot of fun in
that thing I know all my friends used to
come over to come ride it and it was
just a lot a lot of fun so I'm super
excited that I finally have one and I
can write it and Caroline I can even
write it at night because it has lights
on it I can write it in the rain because
it'll be muddy and it'll be so fun
anyways I'm going to go ahead and get
this vlog ended so make sure you give
the video a thumbs up if you enjoy
