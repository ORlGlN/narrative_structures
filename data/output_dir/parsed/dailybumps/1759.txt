okay
you're going to me did did you really I
did anyone so Brian is off to work again
or not work again he's off to the beach
again with his friends and I'm actually
supposed to be at work but I called in
today because my mom has this issue with
her back I know we've mentioned a couple
times but basically she has a bulging
disc in her back and she's in a lot a
lot of pain it's kind of pushing on that
sciatic nerve and so she woke up this
morning in excruciating pain and so we
were thinking we might have had to take
her to the emergency room trying to make
a plan of action because we really want
to figure it out she's really like she
obviously it's like really upsetting
whenever you're basically stuck in a bed
she is worried I mean Oliver is gonna be
here in a few months and she wants to be
able to do things and so we're looking
at possibly surgery because they really
got to fix that bulging disc which
doesn't really fix it on its own
sometimes you got to get surgery and so
she's really nervous about that and
making sure that we get it done in time
so that she can at least you know be
there for the birth and help with Oliver
and all that so it's been a little bit
crazy here so I took the day off
although I am working from home
basically I'm doing a lot of things on
the computer for work Carmen really
wants me to throw his football here I
can't throw a football oh this poor
person just got a parking ticket they
parked right next to a sign that says no
parking 11:00 a.m. - oh we totally
should
so we just got back into Oceanside and
we are getting ready to do some more
filming we're actually doing all the
filming for the fish music vid right oh
yeah day one day one this is it day one
of shooting you guys you know the only
time shooting yeah so it's gonna be
really a long day
I think that's like to say the least of
it yeah but work was Brian and Brian you
know most people that they would take
applause for a music video Brian doesn't
have a mark because he's that amazing so
he's gonna make it worse Thanks yeah
we're actually on the way here we were
listening to some tea sways Taylor Swift
I people they keep making fun of me
because of the way I talk do you guys
think I talk weird leave it in the
comments but I guess I do actually what
were you saying this morning for
everything I was letting him know that
we could stay until tomorrow morning so
I said so that he would understand I
mean I tried did I speak in Brian lingo
so I said hey b-t-dub we're gonna be
here till tomorrow morning
which means by the way yes so funny I'm
like rubbing off on you guys what's
weird is when she did that it was like
there was always a foggy haze in our
communication the moment we used those
words it was like blah clicked with me
yeah damn he got it was like no question
oh you see there's a warship out there
there's a worship out in the water right
now
is that a warship well I mean we can
tell them it's a warship they don't have
to know that it's a chef Rochelle
anyway we were we were driving here and
we were listening to we're listening to
Taylor Swift and some other pop stuff
because I love hearing Jarrod's opinion
about music because he's so smart I mean
he went to school for music so he's like
oh yeah man right here the reason you
like this verse is because because it
goes up down up and down up and dice and
he's like big chord progressions and
he's saying all these fancy music terms
there but it's funny eyes and I see
songs I got done was work and now I'm
set up a little bit out here to sweeten
me my mom to relax I even have my pillow
so that I can okay
I just instagrammed a photo but he's
moved since then but like oh my gosh
seriously he's so weird he like
literally burrowed up here and like the
pictures so we're actually I'll show it
to you right now but you should probably
just follow me on Instagram
cuz you'll see some pretty crazy for
sure yeah okay so that's kind of like
what it look like he literally burrowed
himself up here in my ribs and then he
almost makes this part of me not even
look pregnant like I almost look like
flat down here and then like bulging up
here is the most uncomfortable okay no
the most uncomfortable painful thing
ever but he's repositioned and now he's
more comfortable so I stood up a nice
comfy bed so that I could relax without
worrying about him going up into a weird
spot oh and my mom's feeling better we
got her some pain meds so hopefully that
will help and then we've got appointment
so that we can help fix the actual issue
there you go guy are you doing bunny can
I pet him hi hey he's so little
hi hi buddy Oh Missy would die right now
maybe he needs to pee what is it
- really that's funny yeah they're
probably gonna be looking for later I
might help Jared out it might help Jared
be a little more fun I might be a little
bit more relaxed yeah
alright so we are in downtown outside
and we're just we're about half way done
with filming and it's coming along
really really well and now we're gonna
find it a little secret spot to do a
little intimate moment you guys ready
for this well not intimate but yeah yeah
it's going in there just gonna be like
lovey-dovey you know what I mean
but I think I'm so excited to edit this
it might be done tonight I'll be crazy
I'm kidding
push a button and a video comes out
pretty much I wish that whole that's how
it actually was just push the button
oh yeah I'm gonna try and catch them so
if you can't tell he's like coming out
the side right here and then keeps
kicking like crazy
oh gosh catching some good ones on here
mm-hmm okay those were some good ones
it's hard good like as soon as you start
doing eggs it's like he stops but those
were some pretty dang good ones so we
are just grabbing some lunch and we're
almost done filming we have like maybe
two more shots down at the beach so we
just have to go to the car and make sure
I haven't been towed right runs out on
time yeah they says two hours but we're
just winging it did almost get we
actually did get kicked out oh that one
the security guy was like ugh you can't
hang out back here so we had to sort of
recreate the shot in the front so
hopefully it works pretty sure it will
yeah excuse me it was pretty official
you weren't really saying that we had
permission we just asked them well it's
okay if we finish up its crew we kind of
just assumed that we were like no we can
film here yeah and then it's like well
if you had permission I'd know about it
yeah yeah we're totally just telling you
yeah so we're we're respecting them down
here look at these palm trees they're
like leaning over us that's so cool
can you climb this I mean if anyone can
climb it Jared can right yeah that don't
have tiny little knives all over them oh
