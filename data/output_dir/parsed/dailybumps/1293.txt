cool he's been taking his second now
lately really really well he's been
going down very easily cuz for a while
it was just really hard like you only
want to do his first nap in the second
nap he was like I'm not doing this but
lately he's been really really good I
just feel like he's like in a way he's
like growing up and he's starting to
like really things are starting to click
with him his like him with sign language
is like going really well right now he
can say quite a few words and he's
catching on even quicker I'm starting to
say eat and he's starting to do this but
I have a hard time keeping up with this
one because usually wouldn't be nurse
it's in the dark and so I don't really
get a chance to like do this I started
really early with some sign language and
he's just now starting to catch on and
then some signs I'm just starting right
now

shaving it all off shaving all that hair
off got it I have an idea for this
hashtag you guys remember I got this at
Target I have a feeling I'm going to
mount this hashtag on the chalkboard
wall right and then I'm going to have a
hashtag of the week and maybe I'll use
it like when I upload the vlogs like

was thinking how cool would it be if you

week you know what I mean so I'll have
it here and then you guys vote and then
I basically just like write it after the
hashtag I think that would be really
cool they've been really cool yeah stuff

all right guys is so late and I've got
Oliver to bed actually just got a phone
call with Kelsey and Corbin haven't
talked to him forever but I had this
Heller or show her my dress which Jesus
so that's always good when the bride
actually likes the bridesmaid's dress
that she picked out I'm excited that I
actually got it done I'm guys taken care
of if I find something better there's a
good chance I'll go for it but that is
pretty much perfect so it might just end
up being the one we are so I'm so hungry
are you hungry okay all right starving
we're going to grill up some steak and
green be cutting all the prep work as
apparently burgers you want to cook
tonight okay
9:30 at night though wait you are my
slave
you are my slaving you better get that
correct Wow carre√±o love it stop it I'm
screwing you Brian that's the second
Johnny joke you made today no more
yeah like Missy said it is a late night
but I am grilling some green beans and
steak a lot of people have been asking
me how I do the green beans what you do
is if you're going to grill green beans
put them in a bag with olive oil and
whatever kind of seasoning you want so
we give you like garlic salt sometimes I
do like a garlic and herb or a lemon
pepper and basically just let it soak
for like 15-20 minutes because the grill
will dry it out if it if it hasn't been
marinating in that olive oil for a while
so really super simple all right are you
guys ready for a battle right now
Missy's ready I'm going into battle so
you know how we had a swarm of ants in
the garage the other day well we
actually had pest control come by today
and take care of everything and it turns
out they weren't termites they were just
ants so that was good I just came out
here to get a box
I literally already have these bumps I
went out here to grab a box to the
office and there is I kid you not a
Black Widow you guys and I have to show
you what's underneath it because it's
it's in the she's in the web right and
beneath it dead on the ground is the man
