tougher especially because we have like
a two hour drive home it is not to eat
before you board a plane Mexican food

to wear it on the airplane and I was
like dang it's dirty and then Cassie had
one so now I'm wearing my sisters before
we got on the plane I miss you got Ollie

crash the entire plane but I didn't mean
that I didn't mean like
like you know cuz it's like a party
because we're like on Virgin America and
it's I got the lights and stuff hey
enjoy yourself
thank you
always not slept in
why me in the face
what I can do it
Lulu
literally using everything you can to
get up there all right
you've been a crazy monster
has not slept at all
screaming crying he's just can't fit
though
just been going on for about I would say
three hours now we still have about two
hours left
is crazy lots of longer
absolutely watching fly that was a mom
you're crazy
we just landed still can't hear anything
it always takes a couple hours for again
I was probably the worst flight ever huh
sorry don't be miserable he's tired too
long all right I'll get there faster I
was at our speed Speed Racer I just wish
the pilot would have spent a little bit
I know he was going like 200 miles an
hour slower I think I have something to
do with the winds when you're coming
back the other way it takes longer to
get there so it took like an hour longer
oh look at this
that's my Express it's a vending machine
Missy you might iPad in the vending
machine that's cool
oh my gosh you guys do finally made it
to our car did not find it anywhere
because we were in such a rush that we
really weren't thinking about where our
car was we were thinking of where our
plane was and getting to it and so we
just parked the car and ran and we had
no idea where it was because we were so
late
we didn't park where we normally Park
and so we're like right outside the
terminal and it's very expensive parking
totally sucks because if we wouldn't
have done it and we always we went it we
would have missed it we would have
missed it or had to pay probably like
fees and stuff for missing our flight so
we had to but it's gonna be really
expensive
hello I'm like shaking 180 180 bucks
