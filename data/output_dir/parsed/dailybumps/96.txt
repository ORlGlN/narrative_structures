- So, Ollie and Finn apparently
have not been able to
find Fred this morning.
(dings)
(gasps)
Ollie, Finn, did you guys hear that?
I just heard a twinkle
like magic somewhere.
Do you want to try and find Fred again?

(solemn music)
- Good morning.
-  Good morning.
- We're starting the--
-  Momma.
- The vlog in front of our Christmas tree.
You guys love decorating this thing, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's so cute.
- Momma (mumbling).
(dings)
- I like to pull the ornaments off.
- Yeah, you like to take them off
and does Finn put 'em back on?
(laughs)
Good morning, guys.
We woke up this morning and we found Fred.
-  Momma.
- But we're pretty sure Finn
might have touched him, huh?
- Yeah, I think Finn just touched him.
Then, I think Fred just falled.
-  Momma.
- Yeah.
(mumbling)
- 'Cause he was on the
ground this morning.
So we hurried up and we sprinkled him
with a little bit of cinnamon, right,
next to him 'cause there's
a couple different ways
that you can do to help them
from basically losing their magic.
- And Fred just leave.
- And then he basically just disappeared.
We're hoping that he
was able to make it back
to the North Pole so that
he could see a doctor.
Then, hopefully we get to see
him a little bit later today
and he can let us know that he's okay.
We're kind of just waiting
around waiting for Fred
and hopefully he shows
up soon and he's okay.
(mumbling)
- Yeah, although, you know,
I told Ollie I don't
think it matters too much.
Finn doesn't know really
that he's not supposed to touch him.
I don't think he necessarily
even did it on purpose.
So I don't think that actually
takes away their magic
if it's someone who doesn't
know or if it's a little kid
who doesn't realize they can't touch him.
Just to be safe, we
went ahead and gave him
a little cinnamon so that
he could be all better.
- Hey, guys.
(Christmas music)
- You guys, I just went to
collect eggs from my chickens
and look what I got.
A teeny, tiny little egg.
That means one of the babies
are starting to lay eggs.
I think this is Moana
because she's super tiny.
I'm hoping these eggs get a little bigger
'cause this is like half
the size of a normal egg,
but I'm so excited.
I think I have only two of
the two hens that can lay
'cause I had six and then a bunch
of them ended up being roosters.
So, I forget what I had, but yeah,
I think I'm only gonna get
maybe two more eggs a
day than I already do.
That would be nice
though, but it is so tiny.
Look at that.
It's just little baby.
It's fun when you know for sure
that you're getting a new
egg and a new egg layer.
So exciting.
Ollie, what have you been doing?
- I was just playing.
- Playing?
You having a good day?
I feel like we still haven't found Fred.
Have you seen Fred anywhere?
- No.
-  No?
I know.
Have you been kind of
worried about him still?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
We haven't seen Fred yet
and I know Ollie's been
kind of nervous about it,
so we're hoping we get
to see him soon, huh?
- Yeah.
- Hopefully, he shows up.
Say, "Fred, come back."
Fred, come back.
(hooting)
Maybe he needs you to sing
him a Christmas carol.
Do you want to sing him a Christmas song?
Maybe he'll come back.
- Yeah.
-  Okay, what do you want to sing?
- Dashing through the snow.
-  Okay, ready?
One, two, three.
♪ Dashing through the snow ♪
♪ In a one horse open sleigh ♪
♪ Laughing all the way ♪
♪ Ha ha ha ♪
-  And then say, "Jingle."
(humming)
♪ Jingle bells ♪
♪ Jingle all the way ♪
♪ Oh what fun it is to ride ♪
♪ In a one horse open sleigh ♪
♪ Hey ♪
- Alright, hopefully he shows up soon.
(laughs)
By the way, Christmas album is coming out
really, really soon so
you can hear Ollie sing
all over the album, huh?
- Yellow, guys.
So, Ollie and Finn apparently
have not been able to
find Fred this morning.
(dings)
(gasps)
Ollie, Finn, did you guys hear that?
- What?
- Yeah.
-  What's up, guys?
Hey, Ollie, guess what I just heard?
- What?
-  I just heard a
twinkle like magic somewhere.
Do you want to try and find Fred again?
-  Yeah.
-  Have you found him yet, babe?
- Nah uh, I haven't seen him anywhere.
-  I haven't seen him.
Where do you think he could be?
-  Hmm.
-  There he is.
Do you see him?
- Yeah.
- Oh my gosh.
What's up?
- He has a band aid on him.
-  He's got band aids.
-  Oh no!
-  Oh, Fred.
-  You want me to
read the letter to you?
-  Oh, he's got a letter.
- He left a note.
It says: I was having
so much fun last night,
but when it finally came time
for me to find a spot to sit, I fell.
(gasps)
He fell.
-  Oh no.
- So Finn didn't touch him.
He just fell.
He says, "Thank you so much
"for helping me to the North Pole.
"I feel so much better now.
"Fred."
-  I think Santa Claus
put a lot of band aids
all over him though.
(laughs)
He looks so funny.
(laughs)
-  Oh my goodness.
Well, at least he's better, huh?
- Yeah.
- Look, he...
-  And he's not
afraid of band aids.
- Finn, did you touch him?
- No.
- He kept saying, "No."
Like I feel like you touched him though.
(laughing)
-  So Fred's okay.
Alright, dude?
- Yeah.
-  I thought I heard
that little twinkle in here.
- Yeah, okay, huh.
-  He's just
hanging out in here now.
-  What?
- Feel better, Fred.
(dinging)
(laughs)
(whines)
-  Alright, Finn
wants to ring the bell.
Oh.
(dings)
Was that the bell?
(cheers)
That must have been the
bell I heard, Ollie.
- Yeah.
-  Oh, yeah.
-  So Fred must
have climbed up here
and rang the bell so we could find him.
-  So he was like, "Over here."
(dinging)
-  Hey.
(laughs)
-  Come get me.
-  I'm a little late.
(laughing)
(dinging)
-  That's okay, Fred.
(soft music)
- So I just wanted to
give you guys a little bit
of update about our little
family Christmas album.
You guys saw us finish up recording
I think like last week or the week before.
Everything has been sent to iTunes
and I'm really hoping that
it goes live really soon.
I think it's going up on iTunes
and Spotify and Amazon and stuff,
but it's kind of just
like in their hands now.
Normally, it takes like one
or two days to process that
and then it goes live, so
hoping midweek it goes up
so that I can at least have it
to you guys by this weekend.
I've been listening to it kind
of like from start to finish
multiple times and it just
makes me feel so happy
'cause I love my family.
I just love that they got
to like be a part of it
and it's like our thing.
I think it's gonna be
something that we cherish.
I also wanted to show you guys
something really, really cute.
I just got an email from this girl.
Well, actually her mother.
This is Colette, age seven,
from Minnesota, sent us this photo.
She's actually holding our coloring book.
It says, "Hi, guys.
"Someone has been so excited
to get her coloring book.
"I couldn't make her
wait until Christmas."
I think that is so awesome.
Thanks, Jacob, for sending
me this photo of Colette.
She's so cute and I love
that she was just so excited
to color in our coloring book.
If you don't know, we have
these on our merch store
at www.dailybumpsmerch.com
I'm really excited to see
all your guys' coloring pages
after you actually color what we have.
It's cool 'cause when you
create a coloring book,
you're kind of creating half a book
and you guys are the
other half of the book.
It's kind of like finish it yourself.
You're like, "Wait a minute.
"I paid for this.
"I gotta work?
"I gotta work?"
(laughs)
A little bit, yeah.
If you guys wanted to get one of those,
I'll have our merch store link down below.
Thank you so much for watching, Colette.
Loved your photo.
Merry Christmas.
- Alright, guys, today
has been the longest day.
(whining)
Finn's saying, "Morning."
(coughing)
We've been working so hard all day
and I had this plan to go out at one,
middle of the day before
anyone gets off work,
to go grocery shopping
'cause we are just like missing the milks
and all the regular foods
that you always run out of.
I was like, "I really need to go."
(muttering)
- 'Cause you know what,
when you don't have food
in the house, you just get hangry
and being hangry makes it
even harder to get work done.
Anyways, I had this plan
and now, look at it.
It's dark out.
(groans)
It's not like super late.
It's five o'clock, but
that's still just like uh,
right now I should be making dinner,
getting the kids ready for bed,
and instead, I'm going to
leave to go grocery shopping.
But you guys are excited to go
grocery shopping with Momma?
- Yeah.
- You guys gonna be good for Momma?
I don't know if she can
take anything else today.
I'm so tired and hungry.
Ollie, what are you doing?
- I'm sitting on a red little ball-y.
(shouting)
-  Are you talking
about Target balling?
- Yeah.
(gasps)
-  Do you want to do it too?
-  Yeah.
- Watch me jump on it.
-  Okay, go.
(laughs)
-  Watch.
-  Are you Target balling too?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Ollie, who used to do this?
Throwback to if you guys
remember Target balling
and when it used to be a thing.
Shout out to Cullen and Katie.
We love them and we miss them a lot.
He used to do Target ball.
You guys will have to look it up.
(shouts)
Alright, let's go shopping.
We need a cart so I can
contain all these kids.
- There.
-  Alright,
we've got our Starbucks.
I got a hot chocolate and
the boys got, whoop, water.
- I got water.
- I got it.
- That's Momma's, huh?
You got your water?
Is it good?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I'm a little bummed because
they only had the biggest cart
available instead of the one
that has like the two seaters.
(shouting)
It's so hard because I
have to contain the kids
and there's no room for the groceries.
So, Ollie's gonna get switched to
and he'll end up having
to walk which will be fun.
(light music)
Alright, we're almost done,
but Ollie is so squished right now, huh?
- Yeah.
(laughs)
-  And Finn is being crazy.
Am I gonna have to get you out of there?
He's like, "Mom, I can't fit."
Okay, there we go.
(grunts)
Okay.
-  Momma.
-  Now, you're gonna
walk and you're gonna scream.
Okay, that's the order.
-  Momma.
(screams)
(laughs)
-  We did it
and no one started crying.
(whining)
Including Momma, yay.
Let's go home, okay.
Go see Daddy.
Where's da da?
- Dah-ee.
- Where's da da?
- Dah-ee.
Whoos da da?
- Well, I hope you guys enjoyed
me shopping with the boys.
(shouting)
Real life shopping.
(shouting)
Why are you screaming?
(groans)
Yeah, that was hard, but you
know what, we got it done.
I feel like you really got to experience
what it's like to shop
with these two crazy kids
or honestly, shop with any two crazy kids
'cause being a mom and grocery
shopping with kids is hard.
But you do it and it's fine.
You get through it and everyone's
good in the end, right.
We've got food.
Let's go home and eat dinner, okay.
- Yeah.
(shouts)
- Yay, it's 6:52.
It's--
(screams)
(laughs)
(upbeat music)
