Good morning guys.
As you guys might know,
we are getting ready
for a really awesome party
today, Friendsgiving,
and I am super excited.
We've never had a real
Friendsgiving before, huh?
A real Friendsgiving where
everyone brings something...
-  Yeah, it's like a potluck.
and it's, yeah.
We are in charge of just the turkey
and the cranberry sauce?
And the gravy.
And the gravy.
So it's really really minimal.
Gravy is essential,
but the person doing the
turkey has to make the gravy.
Yeah, for sure.
'Cause you need the turkey
drippings and stuff.
But I couldn't just leave it at that.
I felt like I needed to do more.
So I'm in charge of also fudge.
Really just wanted to
make some yummy fudge.
I'm also in charge of some cookies.
I'm gonna make some cool little cookies
and I'm also going to
even dip strawberries.
So I'm really excited.
I gotta get started on
all my little projects.
I'm not too worried about it.
I think it's going to
be pretty fun and easy
and not too stressful of a Thanksgiving.
Honestly, our real
Thanksgiving is gonna be
so much more stressful than this.
(funky music)
Oh morning boys.
-  Good morning.
-  Are you guys watching some TV?
-  Yeah.
Well I was thinking it might be really fun
if we go swimming.
Yeah!
-  You wanna go swimming?
-  Yes, yes, yes!
We do have a hot tub that is nice and warm
that the boys can swim in,
but Ollie has been begging
to go into the big pool
and so I was like--
Cool pool.
Cool pool.
-  Maybe I'll let
you go in there, okay?
Yeah.
So I actually just went
and turned on the hot tub
so that the hot tub is nice
and warm, that's the heater.
Ollie is going to jump
into this ice cold water,
but we're gonna play
a little trick on him.
We've done this before, so I
know he actually enjoys it,
but it will still be really, really funny.
He probably thinks the water is like
a nice, normal temperature,
but it's literally freezing cold.
Not freezing cold, but
it's probably like 60, 62.
And then we have the hot tub on,
so I'm gonna see if we
can get a funny reaction
of him jumping into a very cold pool.
Ollie, are you excited
to jump in the pool?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
-  You're so excited!
We haven't been swimming in so long, huh?
Yeah.
-  Finn, are you
excited to swim in the pool?
Whoa!
-  That's the
fastest Lightening McQueen.
-  Oh really?
-  Let's see
if he can run into me.
-  Whoa!
Alright Ollie, let's
get our bathing suit on
and jump in the pool.
Ollie, I love your Star Wars swim shorts!
Yeah, 'cause the new
Star Wars is coming out.
Yes, Ollie is so excited to go see
the new Star Wars in December.
I've already bought tickets and
we're gonna dress up, right?
Yeah.
We find little victories, with Star Wars--
I'm gonna be Kylo Ren and
I'm gonna be the (mumbles)
Really?
Okay!
Finn is so happy too.
He's like, I've got my bathing suit on.
Do you wanna see my punches?
-  Sure.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Careful.
Okay, let's get in the pool.
(funky music)
-  Alright Ollie, are you ready?
Yeah!
-  Alright, climb up there.
He's so excited to jump in the pool.
Oh my gosh!
How's it feel?
-  Not good.
-  Not good?
What's wrong?
Is it cold?
(laughs)
He's so cold.
-  Oh my goodness.
You just did the Polar Plunge Challenge,
I'm so proud of you dude.
Finn, you wanna try it?
-  No.
-  No?
Finn, you jump in the pool, come on.
No?
(playful music)
Whoa, hot tub time.
How's that water feel?
(laughs)
I'm guessing this water
feels a lot better.
Here comes Finn.
Finn's like, uh, I don't think
it's quite up to temperature yet.
How cold is it Ollie?
Good.
-  Is it not bad?
No?
It's good enough for Ollie.
Finn is seriously like, keep testing it.
He's like, yeah, no.
Oh, he splashed you.
Awe (chuckles)
Oh, Ollie.
(laughs)
Boys are so cute.
(playful music)
That's crazy, why are you in there?
Don't spray me.
-  I think he's getting used to it.
Uh oh, he's coming back.
-  No, no!
-  Go get mama.
-  Hey!
-  Oh, careful.
(laughter)
I need some more.
-  Oh, careful.
(playful music)
Ollie keeps filling up
his mouth with water
so he can squirt mama.
(chuckles) Careful.
-  You can't get me.
-  Go get her Ollie, go get her.
Get her, get her, spray her.
He laughed (mumbles)
-  Are you getting
used to the temperature?
It's not so cold now, huh?
(playful music)
So we are getting ready
for Friendsgiving all day
and then we have our dinner tonight.
Ollie and Finn are actually going
to go hang out with MiMi and Papa
and spend the night there,
so they're super excited.
The last time Finn spent
the night at my parents,
it did not go well.
He didn't have a crib and so
and that's what he
sleeps in now is a crib.
He had to sleep next to my
mom, which he doesn't do that,
so he was kind of like all over the place.
It was just kind of hard,
and I've been trying to
figure out a solution
because we are actually going
on our Thanksgiving vacation
in a few weeks and so I was
like, what am I gonna do?
He doesn't sleep in a Pack 'N Play
and we can't take a crib with us.
So I figured it out; I did it last night
and I basically put his
mattress inside of this net.
Inside the netting that
usually goes into his crib
and then I put something
on both sides of the bed
so he doesn't roll off of
it, and it totally worked.
I'm so excited.
So yeah, I think this is
going to be a good solution
so that he sleeps at my parents
and doesn't just go run
around everywhere crazy
and not sleep well.
He'll get a good night sleep
in his crib with his
bedding and everything.
So, yeah, I'm just gonna start
packing up the boys right now
so they can go hang out with MiMi and Papa
and I think Auntie's
actually coming down too
and they're gonna film some videos
and do some fun stuff, so
they're like super excited.
Alright, the boys are loaded up.
Are you excited?
Yes, we're going to open toys.
-  You're gonna go do
something fun with Auntie?
Yeah.
Yeah.
-  And are you excited Finn?
Yeah.
-  Yeah, alright.
You guys have a good night.
Be good for MiMi and Papa, 'kay?
I mean it.
I love you guys, I'll miss you.
Finn's crib is all loaded up.
They've got all their jammies
and everything they need.
Alright, have a good night, 'kay?
-  'Kay.
-  Love you.
Love you too.
-  Oh gosh, it smells like
I'm gonna cry.
I am cutting onions and I am doing,
God it's really coming on strong.
-  It really is, I think
I'm gonna have to walk away.
I'm gonna film you over here.
I'm doing roasted vegetables
in the bottom of the turkey pan this year.
-  Look how cool that looks.
So I'm just putting a ton of vegetables,
and then I'm gonna put
olive oil all over them,
and then put our turkey right on top.
We don't really eat onion,
but onion is good flavor.
-  It's good flavor, yeah.
Onion has good flavor,
so we're just gonna throw it in there
with some olive oil, and
salt and pepper and stuff.
-  Looks good.
(upbeat music)
Alright we've got our turkey all ready
to throw it in the oven.
-  It looks so beautiful.
It's got veggies underneath,
it's all seasoned in olive oil
and then I got lots of
rosemary and thyme and sage.
-  Yum.
Those are my cookies beeping.
-  For sure, look at that.
-  Oh wait, you forgot to tent it.
Oh we gotta put some foil over it.
(Missy laughs)
-  Okay.
Alright you guys.
So Missy and I are throwing
a Friendsgiving tonight,
which means we're just gonna have
a bunch of couples come
over that we're friends with
and we're gonna eat a Thanksgiving meal.
So we had to have a little fun with it,
so we decorated our front door,
so it looks like Monica's
front door at the apartment.
So it's got the apartment
number, and then, close it.
The other side of her house is--
-  Purple!
Purple!
And of course we have to
have the famous frame.
-  Yes, so we have
to put the frame on the door
and hopefully it stays up.
I just think this is gonna be
so cool for pictures, you know?
-  Right there?
Yeah, I think that's good.
This is like our first
ever, official dinner party.
I'm so excited to have friends over, food,
and get to hang out.
Plus it's always fun
having Thanksgiving early,
because I love Thanksgiving food.
I mean, who doesn't?
And I like to do Thanksgiving, so--
-  Babe, that looks so good.
Yay, we have our own Friends door.
(playful music)
So Missy and I just finished
setting up this table.
Which by the way, I am so impressed.
We fit 14 chairs around this table.
Like, we can't invite any more than
14 people to these dinner parties.
But we did it, look, this is awesome Babe.
Yeah, I love it.
And I love how it turned out.
Me and Bryan did this all ourselves.
-  Yeah, we picked everything
and we knew how we wanted
it to look and stuff.
And we agreed on what we wanted even.
-  Yeah.
Usually one of us has to give
up and let the other one--
(Bryan laughs)
And look how cute this is,
we even have a placemat for Juniper.
She'll be the only kid
at this dinner party,
because she's a baby.
So she gets to sit with all the cool kids.
Friendsgiving has begun.
(playful music)
Just came outside and found
this cat lying around.
Oh look at this cat, oh he's kinda cute.
Oh, smelly cat.
Smelly cat has come to
join our Friendsgiving.
Happy Friendsgiving!
-  Happy Friendsgiving.
-  We got Juni,
we got Kelsey and Corbin,
and we have a whole houseful.
Happy Friendsgiving you guys.
(crowd cheers)
Hey I have an announcement to make,
thank you guys all for coming.
Food is now ready and on the table,
so dance your happy faces over.
Crystal made mulled wine.
I'm about to drink it.
-  Oh, it smells so good,
and it looks so good,
and look at your cup.
Princess Consuela banana hammock,
and you can take it home.
We bought a ton of
Friends themed cups here.
Here, this one's yours, crap bag.
You gotta have a crap bag.
So we just got done with dinner
and now we are all coming to the fountain.
(laughs)
 The water is nice.
-  The fountain!
-  Can
you like edit it in?
Woo!
-  Everyone has to like, yeah,
everyone has to dance in the water.
(upbeat music)
That was such a fun time you guys.
We've never really thrown like
a dinner party like that or anything.
It was so cool just to get
to hang out with everyone
and we played board games
and ate a ton of pie,
so that was basically it.

vlog, I wanted to remind you
