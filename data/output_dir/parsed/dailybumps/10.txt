- Morning!
- Good morning!
-  Whoa, good morning to Ollie.
♪ This is our life ♪
♪ Let's live it ♪
♪ Live it forever ♪
Barn hair, don't care.
- Good morning.
I love this hat.
I got it on Amazon.
I was like, "That's so cute!"
- Good morning, guys.
Today we are all out of the house
because Ollie does not have school today.
So we are gonna be running some errands
as a family.
- Yay!
- And we have a couple things to do.
We have to go grocery shopping.
We're looking for a couch
for Missy's secret project.
And then we are also doing
something really fun tonight
with the boys.
Finn, do you know what we're doing?
- Yeah.
-  Ollie, do you know?
- No.
-  Yes you do.
Why is he pretending like he doesn't know?
Is he like, "Am I not supposed to know?
"What if I know and then it
means I'm not allowed to go?"
- Do you know what we're doing later?
-  What we're gonna go see tonight?
- What?
- Here's a hint, Ollie.
♪ This is the greatest show ♪
Now where are we going tonight?
- The circus.
- The circus, that's right,
the circus is in town.
And it's a really good circus,
so we wanna take the boys
because they've been
loving The Greatest Showman
soundtrack; we've been
listening to it like crazy.
I think it's out on--
Is it out?
Oh, we need to watch it with them.
- Yeah, he saw the big circus tent
the other day and I
personally was never allowed
to go to a circus when I was kid
because my parents felt
that they were probably
abusive to animals and stuff,
so I was like, I have to check to see
if we can go, Ollie,
'cause I don't wanna go
if it's not a very good one.
But apparently this one is a good one.
It's totally good, they
don't use any animals.
And I think it's just gonna be fun.
- My parents apparently weren't as nice.
They didn't care about the
animals, 'cause I went.
Yeah, I mean, I went to
circus with elephants,
giraffes, and lions and stuff.
I know, nowadays in our time I feel like
that definitely is not allowed,
for good reasons, but it's interesting,
the experience that Ollie's gonna have
at the circus versus
what we had growing up.
- Do you think it'll be so
different without animals?
- Oh yeah, I think so, for sure.
But I think it'll still be a good show.
It's still gonna be the greatest show
and regardless, this is the
greatest show right here.
-  Yeah.
-  All you guys.
- The future's so bright
I have to wear shades.
- He may have learned that from me.
(laughs)
What, Ollie, why is there
cracks on the ground?
- Sometimes the world breaks it.
-  The world breaks it?
- Yeah.
-  Oh, with
an earthquake?
- Yeah, I think so.
- Yeah, I think it's an earthquake.
All right, we are headed
in to the furniture store.
- Mimi and Papa have this couch upstairs.
- They do, huh?
So Missy actually found a couch
and she's buying it and all that,
so I'm taking the boys
and literally just
walking around the store
trying to get my step counter going.
(laughs)
I've been stuck at the house
for a couple days straight
and I haven't moved a whole lot
and my Apple watch reminds
me of it quite a bit,
so I'm like, well, let's just walk
around the store.
But then this happens.
We find a bunk bed and the
boys just wanna climb it.
How's that one?
- Good.
-  Good.
Ollie, you were literally just saying
how much you love your
bed the other day, huh?
- Yeah.
- He was so sweet.
He was like, "I really love my bunk bed.
"Thank you guys so much."
And it was one of those moments
where I was like, "That's so sweet."
(laughs)
This is a cool one, huh?
- Yeah.
- They're so cute,
I just say, "Ten-hut!"
And they come by and
they start following me.
I've gotta teach 'em
left-right-left, though.
(laughs)
- Left, left, left-right-left.
-  Where are we going next, boys?
- To the store!
- We're going to Target!
I don't know if we've
done a family Target run
in forever.
- 'Cause we're smart in full.
- I know, this is going to be a mistake,
a very big mistake.
But first, Starbucks.
(laughs)
So me and Bryan have decided to split up
and he's going to take
on starting the groceries
and I'm going to do all
the non-grocery items.
So I've got Finn, Starbucks,
and we're gonna get that shopping done
and then meet up with Bryan
and finish up the groceries.
And just like that, we're done, huh Finn?
- Yeah.
-  Woo-hoo!
(laughs)
- All right, guys, we are back home
and I just finished
cleaning the entire fridge
and stocking everything
and, yes, we got a lot of Bubly.
For those of you wondering,
I know I've talked about La Croix a lot,
but I just tried Bubly
and it's really good,
and so I am stocking the house up
with some of this sparkling water.
I've been drinking sparkling water
for like four months now
in place of soda and it has changed
a lot of different things, so
I swear by it.
I drink that stuff all the time.
I've been drinking a
lot of sparkling water
and a lot of tea lately.
But my sister actually just sent me
a package and I wanted to show you
what she got me,
'cause she's just the coolest.
Finally got your birthday card, sister,
in case you were wondering,
and yes, she put 1,000
dollars in it, sweet!
My sister actually sells dōTERRA,
and I use those every now and then,
so I had her send me a couple ones,
and she's so cute,
she writes everything down,
like "This one's for Slim and Sassy,"
this is what it does,
this is how you can use it.
Past Tense is like a tension blend,
helps ease stressful feelings.
And then she always throws in a little
(laughs) sample.
Yeah, she always throws
in a little sample,
and I'm like, "You know I'm your brother,
"I'm probably gonna bye from you anyway."
She's like, "I don't care."
This one is the, ooh,
vanilla roller, cool.
She always pops something in for the boys,
which I think is really cute.
She threw in some Pop Rocks.
The boys are going to love these.
She's always so nice.
I love my sister, I miss her.
I wish she lived closer.
Three, two, wah!
Pop rocks!
- Why is there a red one, a green one,
and a blue one?
-  Well, those are
all the ones that we have.
Which one do you want?
- I want the red one.
- Okay, you can have the red one.
Finn, do you want watermelon
or tropical punch?
That one?
All right, save your Pop Rocks, boys,
because we going to the circus.
- Yeah!
-  Are you excited
to see some flips and cool stunts?
- Yeah, but we are going to a circus
that doesn't have animals.
- That's right, it
doesn't have any animals.
(laughs)
We talked about that this morning.
You think he remembers.
-  The circus!
-  It's right there, huh?
You see the big old tent?
(upbeat music)
All right, we got the essentials:
Popcorn and cotton candy.
Want some popcorn, Finn?
Yeah, whoa boys, look at this.
We are going into a real circus.
Are you so excited?
This is gonna be so cool!
Are you excited, Finn?
- Yeah!
-  Look at that!
- I see a treasure box.
-  I think, Ollie,
that this circus has pirates.
-  Pirates?
-  All right, Ollie,
let's try your Pop Rocks.
How does it feel?
(upbeat music)
Whoa, I think there's a
big old pirate ship, Ollie.
- Ahh, pirate ship.
-  There's pirates, huh?
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
-  Huh?
- That's a cool captain right there!
Look at that!
-  That's the captain, yep.
(upbeat music)
Oh no, Ollie, I think the evil
pirate clown's coming out!
Ooh, there she is.
- She's so high up there!
- She is, huh?
- Yeah!
- Wow, I did not know
that there was pirates in this circus
or that they could do that.
That's crazy!
(upbeat music)
- That's a big pirate ship.
(dramatic music)
-  Whoa, whoa!
(mumbles)
(dramatic music)
- Um, Dada, is that a real mermaid?
(dramatic music)
-  Whoa!
That's a real mermaid, Ollie!
Finn, you see the mermaid?
- Yeah.
-  Look at the mermaid!
That's so cool.
(upbeat electronic music)
-  What's she doin' in there?
- I don't know.
-  What happened?
She has legs now!
You guys, the mermaid has legs now.
(upbeat electronic music)
Whoa!
- Is he balancing up there?
-  He's balancing, yeah.
Can you do that?
No? (chuckles)
Whoa, he's jumping rope.
Whoa!
That is talent right there, huh Ollie?
- Yeah.
- He's so good!
Whoa, they brought out knives.
That guy has knives.
Oh gosh, what's about to
happen right now, guys?
What?
(upbeat electronic music)
- He did a flip!
-  They are bringing
out more sharp objects,
oh gosh.
Oh no, are you nervous?
Are you nervous, Finn?
What's gonna happen?
(upbeat electronic music)
Ollie, that's attached to her hair.
(upbeat electronic music)
That is the craziest thing ever.
I don't think I could do that.
My hair would come out.
They're taking him
and they're putting him in the box.
Oh no.
What's gonna happen, guys?
What?
How did he get out of the box?
- I don't know.
-  And now she's in there?
What?
She's getting in the box again.
(dramatic music)
No!
She's in there!
Whoa!
(upbeat electronic music)
That was crazy!
This is happening right in front of us.
This is nuts.
(upbeat electronic music)
(engines rumbling)
Whoa!
- So cool!
(upbeat electronic music)
- This is seriously
happening like ten feet
in front of us right now.
(laughs)
(upbeat electronic music)
(engines rumbling)
Whoa!
That's crazy!
Finn, before you fall asleep,
did you like the circus?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it was pretty neat, huh?
(laughs)
They had so much fun, you guys.
They're also exhausted, aren't you?
Are you gonna fall asleep in the car
on the way home?
- No.
- No? (laughs)
He's being so funny
and talking so quietly.
Ollie, what did you like about the circus?
- About the captain.
-  The pirate captain?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, he was so
excited to see the captain
when we walked out.
- Yeah, he was like, "Can
I take a picture with him?"
- That was so cool, wasn't it, boys?
- Yeah.
-  Did you like it?
- Yeah.
- We had so much fun at the circus.
I seriously did not even know
that it was gonna be a pirate themed one,
and they had mermaids.
That was so neat.
