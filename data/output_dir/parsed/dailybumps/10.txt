It is Valentine's Day for you guys.
For us, it's actually
tomorrow, but we have
a lot of fun things planned
for today, don't we?
Yes.
So, Ollie just got back from school,
and what did you get, dude?
- I got a baggie.
-  A baggie, 'cause you guys
passed out Valentine's Day cards?
- Yeah.
-  All right, Ollie is getting
Valentine's Day cards ready for school.
- For AJ and me and Ethan.
(Man laughs)
-  Is AJ your best friend at school?
- Yeah, I love him.
-  Aw, so you're
gonna give him a valentine
and everyone else in your class, right?
- Yeah.
-  That's so cool,
show us what you got, Ollie.
What kinda valentine?
- So I got Skittles,
and Valentine's Day hearts, and basically
you put the Spider-Brad cards on here.
-  Uh-huh.
-  Mm-hmm.
-  And you put the sucker in there.
-  Oh, so you put the sucker on the
Spider-Brad Valentine's card?
- Yeah.
-  That's cool,
and what's Mama doing?
- She's writing.
- Writing your name, right?
- Yeah. I did it.
-  Cool.
-  Lemme show you.
-  Okay.
Oh, so you put that through that hole,
and then that through that hole?
(gasps) That's so cool.
- Yeah.
-  That's awesome.
- You took it out, put it back in.
(Man laughs)
- I'm so excited to Valentine's Day
(upbeat music)
It's a owl.
-  Oh, that is so cool,
did you do that yourself?
- Yeah.
-  That's so cool, all
right, you wanna show 'em
all your valentines you got today?
- Yeah.

first valentines, you guys.
I'm so excited, whoa.
You got Fun Dip?
- Yeah.
-  Who's that from?
- It's from Peyton.
- Oh, cool
I remember getting valentines in school.
It was the funnest thing
ever, passing them out
and getting candy and stuff.
Ooh, what's it say?
- This is from AJ.
-  Oh, that's awesome, it says,
"You are a great friend,"
and it's got Transformers.
This is actually from Ben, Ollie.
Yeah. (laughs)
AJ is his little buddy
at school, it's so funny.
Ollie, find which one AJ got you.
Ooh, you got a Frozen one
from Nicole, that's neat.
And then, ooh, you got one from yourself?
- Yeah.
(Man laughs)
-  These are your valentines.
What's that?
- It's chocolate.
-  Oh.
- You can't eat it, you have
to put it in the bathtub.
-  Oh, that's so cool, so you can
draw on the bathtub with it?
- Yeah.
-  That's so neat.
You got a car?
"I like the way you roll,"
that's from Wyatt, awesome.
Ooh, you got M&M's, and PAW
Patrol, that's so cool, Ollie.
- This from Miss Tracey.
-  Really, your
teacher got you something?
- Yeah.
-  Well, do you wanna
open it up and read it?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, here, you take
the lollipop off, there you go.
Ollie, the one from Miss Tracey says,
"Hope your Valentine's
Day is Tricera-tops."
So the one from Miss
Tracey also comes with
a little scratcher, so
scratch the purple heart
and it will reveal something.
Does it smell?
Ooh, I think it smells, smell it.
- Oh, smell it.
- What's it smell like?
Ooh, it smells like grape.
-  I wanna smell it.
- Oh, that smells good.
(sniffs)
Smell good?
- Mm.
-  Ollie, I found the one from AJ.
- Really?
-  Yeah, he got you a PAW Patrol one,
you wanna open it?
- Yeah.
-  Okay.
(upbeat music)
Ooh, what is it?
- A pa-at-true.
-  Oh, it's a puzzle?
- Yeah.
-  That is so cool, it
came with a little puzzle.
And you can take it apart and
put it back together again.
- Yeah.
- That's neat.
So you had a good Valentine's
Day at school, buddy?
- Yeah.
- That's awesome.
Well, I think, while Mama
is taking care of Nacho,
we should leave something
to surprise her with,
what do you think?
Do you wanna set up your
Valentine's Day surprise for Mama?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
He's like, Uh, I'm gonna dig
into this Fun Dip, though.
(Brad laughs)
All right, so the boys are
working on Mama's card,
and they're doing some drawing right now.
- This is gonna be Mama.
-  That's so cool.
Finn, Mama's gonna love that, huh?
Ooh, that's cool.
- That gonna be her mouth.
-  Okay, then her eyes up there?
-  Yeah.
-  So do two eyes right there, then.
One, two, oh that's a
great picture of Mama,
I think she'll love that.
-  Then I'm gonna draw a nose.
-  Nice, you just drew
a nose, that's pretty good.
All right, Missy just got home.
Walk towards the sound of my voice, babe.
The boys have a little surprise for you.
- Okay.
-  Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.
-  Come a little closer.
(Missy squeals excitedly)
-  A little closer,
little closer and now.
-  Happy Valentine's Day.
(Man laughs)
-  Happy Valentine's Day.
- So cute.
(gasps) That says "Mom"?
-  Yeah.
-  Did you write that?
-  Yeah.
-  Yep, that's an "m,"
that is a ginormous "o,"
and then the other little "m"
is inside the "o." (laughs)
-  Aw, and a big teddy bear?
- And a flower.
- Oh cool, it's so cute.
What's the teddy bear's name?
- I wanna name it Cutie.
- Cutie?
(Man laughs)
You're much better than
me, 'cause Daddy got me one
when it was my birthday, and he said,
"What do you wanna name it?"
I said, "I don't know yet,"
and that was his name forever.
- And we name it I Don't Know Yet.
Some of you guys who've
been watching our vlogs
for a long, long time know that, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Open your card.
- So this is a big card?
Oh my goodness.
-  The boys worked
really hard on this.
- Okay.
"Happy Valentine's Day."
- Open it, open it.
- Okay, okay.
(Brad laughs)
- "Roses are red, violets are blue,
"some cards rhyme, but this one doesn't."
Happy Valentine's Day anyway.
Love, Brad and Ollie, and Finn."
- Mom, that's you, that's you.
-  (gasps) That's me?
-  Yeah
-  I'm ginormous. (laughs)
-  Looks just like you, right?
- Does it look just like me?
It's so pretty.
(Brad laughs)
That's such a good
drawing, Ollie, good job.
-  Isn't that cool?
-  This is so cool.
-  And then they picked out this
giant rose to give you, and
I think it's going to become
a sword in our house.
- I needed a giant rose, honestly.
-  Everyone needs a giant rose.
- And a giant card.
-  I know. (laughs)
- And a big bear.
Where's my giant chocolate?
- There's no giant chocolate.
(Missy laughs)
-  So normally when we get cards,
we should probably put 'em
right here, that looks like
a good spot, you wanna
set the card up there?
- What about above the fireplace?
-  Oh, that looks
really good right there.
- I mean, it's really
covering stuff, but okay.
-  It's quite large. (laughs)
- I think the fireplace.
-  Maybe on the fireplace.
-  Okay, let's see.
-  Could always put it up there.
- It can go behind this.
-  There we go.
See, that's not obnoxious at all, babe.
-  No.
- She doesn't like it.
Wouldn't be Valentine's
Day without some chocolate.
Look at these adorable
chocolate mice, you guys.
They have these tails, so all
you do is pick up the tail,
and then the little mice
comes with it. (laughs)
So, lift it up by its tail,
and then put it in your mouth.
(laughs) And then pull
the tail, there you go.
(Finn humming)
Is it good?
-  I wanna try the black one.
- Okay.
They are seriously so good, you guys.
Here, you wanna try it?
Ollie's eating a mouse. (laughs)
- Mm.
-  Nice, and then
just take a big bite.
What do you think?
- Good.
- It's so good, you guys.
I think it's called Burdick's chocolate,
my sister sent it to me, and she's like,
"You have to try these, these
are the most amazing things."
And they have, like,
the cutest little mice.
(upbeat music)
-  Hey boys, you
know who loves lollipops?
- What?
-  Squirrels.
- Squirrels?
-  You wanna go see if your squirrel
in your bedroom likes it?
- Yeah.
- (gasps) Wow.
-  What?
- Look.
-  (gasps) What is that?
-  Ollie and Finn's
squirrel has something,
it's like a card.
Do you think if I give him the lollipop,
he'll give me the envelope?
- Yeah.
-  Here, let's see.
Okay, squirrel, I'm just
gonna distract you over here,
look at the lollipop, look
at the lollipop, oh, oh.
-  Got it.
-  You got it, okay, you got it.
What is it?
- A note, it says, "Ollie and Finn."
-  I think we should open it, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Do you think this could be,
like, a clue or something?
- Yeah.
-  Well, let's open it and see.
-  Let's see what it says.
-  Whoa, there's a card in there?
Ooh, what's it say,
let's have mama read it.
- It says, "If you're tweet
like me, follow back."
"Your Valentine's quest has begun,
"and we're excited for
you to have lots of fun."
-  (gasps) Ooh.
-  "Valentine's Day can be sappy."
"Your first clue is next to the nappies."
-  What, a clue?
-  Your first clue.
- Clues.
Does that mean this is, like,
a Valentine's Day treasure hunt, guys?
- Oh, yeah.
-  Do you guys wanna
go on a treasure hunt?
- Yeah.
- Okay, so it says the first
clue is near the nappies, do
you know what nappies are?
- Yeah.
-  What are nappies?
- Nappies is another word for diapers.
- It's actually what they call diapers
in England, in Britain.
- So it says your first
clue is next to the nappies.
- So, should we go look for diapers,
and see if we see another clue?
-  Yeah.
- Well, where do we keep the diapers?
Finn, where are your diapers at?
-  Where's the diapers.
- Next to the TV.
-  Yeah.
- I think the squirrel just
spit the food out of its face.
-  Maybe.
Open the cupboard, Finn,
this is where we keep all his
diapers, pull out the drawer.
(dog barking)
What's in there?
Oh, a clue.
Uh, boys, I think we got
a situation on our hands.
This one says "Clue
number one," do you think
it leads to multiple clues?
-  Yeah.
- How Brady clues are there?
-  Finn is tearing open the clue.
(Finn yells)
-  What's in there?
(Finn vocalizes)
-  Is that you?
Oh, and cookies.
-  Oh my gosh, cookies.
-  You guys each get a cookie?
- I don't need one.
-  You don't want one? Okay.
-  All right, it says,
"You're a rawrsome valentine."
-  That is so cute,
that's Finn in a dinosaur costume.
-  So cute, let's see.
-  What's it say?
-  "Congrats on
finding your first clue."
"You almost missed it."
"Clue number two is hiding
with the biscuits." (gasps)
- Biscuits?
-  Do you guys
know what biscuits are?
Where do you think the biscuits are?
- I don't know.
- So, Ollie, biscuits is another
word they use in England,
and that's what they call
cookies, did you know that?
-  Yeah.
-  Maybe we should go
look where the cookies are.
Should we?
-  Yeah.
-  Let's go look.
-  And there was
cookies in there, you know?
-  Yeah.
-  Finn's like, "Oh
yeah, I get two Oreos."
Okay, let's go look.
I think cookies are
usually in the pantry, huh?
Here, I'll get this
child-safe lock, there we go.
-  Can you see
any cookies, any clues?
-  Let us know
if you guys see a clue.
-  Oh, there it is.
-  What'd you find?
What is it?
- Card.
-  Ooh, it's another clue?
- Yeah.
-  Ooh.
-  That one says, "Clue number two,"
should we open it, boys?
- Yeah.
- This is so cool.
Have you guys ever been on a
Valentine's Day treasure hunt?
- No.
-  No, we haven't, huh?
So let's see what this clue says.
Ooh, that's a picture of you, huh?
- All right, your next clue
says, "Aren't cookies the best?
Take a bite and start to think.
Clue number three is ice-cold
with all the fizzy drinks."
Hmm.
-  Ooh.
- Clue number three, all the fizzy drinks.
And it's gotta be ice-cold.
-  Hey, hey Finn, do you know
where all the drinks are?
- Yeah.
-  Where?
(Finn hums)
- The refrigerator?
- I think he doesn't know.
- Yeah?
-  Should we go find 'em?
-  Yeah.
-  Let's go see.
(Finn grunting)
-  Nope, they're not in there.
-  Nope, that one?
-  I don't know, it
seems like too cold for drinks.
-  Fizzy drinks, maybe in this one?
-  Where does Daddy
get his drinks from, boys?
- From here.
-  There it is, right there.
-  Oh, Finn found it again.
-  Awesome job, Finn.
-  Good job, dude.
-  Do you wanna open it up?
-  He (mumbles) me.
(Brad laughs)
-  Is it cold, Finn?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, 'cause it
was in the fridge, huh?
(Finn vocalizing)
- Oh yeah, it is cold,
feel it, feel it guys.
-  Wow it's very cold.
- Dada, feel it.
-  I know, it's cold.
(Finn vocalizing)
-  Do you want
me to read it to you?
- No.
-  He's got it.
(Finn vocalizing)
This is clue number
three, are you boys ready?
- Yeah.
-  All right, Mama, read it.
- It says, "You guys
work so well together."
"Let's go outside and
play in the weather."
"Put on your wellies, and
don't forget your socks."
"Remember on Valentine's Day, love rocks."
- Whoa, that's a long clue, huh?
First it says, "Put on your wellies."
-  What's a wellie?
-  Do you guys
know what wellies are?
- No.
- So wellies are actually a
type of rain boot from England.
-  Rain boot?
- That's what they call their
boots, did you know that?
- Is that a rainbow?
(Finn vocalizing)
- No, rain boots.
I think you guys should put on your boots
and we should head outside, okay?
-  Yeah.
- It also says "love rocks,"
so maybe we gotta find some rocks.
- It also has a clue too.
-  Probably by the rocks, huh?
- Yeah.
-  All right, let's
put our shoes on, boys.
-  Yeah.
(upbeat music)
-  Hey Finn, while
you're getting your shoes on,
what do you think is in this treasure box?
Do you thin there's lots of gold?
- Yeah.
- And I think there's lots of gems.
-  Gems?
- Yeah.
-  Ooh.
- And necklaces.
-  Yeah, we need to go look, huh?
- Yep.
-  All right guys,
we gotta find some rocks.
Do you know where any rocks are, babe?
- Um.
-  We might be able to find some.
-  Yeah, Ollie, do
you know where rocks are?
-  What, Finn?
(Finn vocalizing)
There's rocks over there?
-  Yeah.
Ooh maybe there's a clue, go look boys.
(upbeat music)
Oh that's right, we do have
these rocks on our property.
- Look at all the giant rocks.
-  What do you see?
-  What is it?
-  Is that marmalade?
What?
-  Oh my gosh.
-  Why is there
marmalade out here, Ollie?
- I don't know.
-  Oh, and a clue.
- Yeah.
-  A clue, grab it Ollie.
That is so exciting.
-  Wow.
- "Clue number four."
Here, let's open the clue
and see what it says.
It says, "Ooh, marmalade,
what a special treat."
"Does it remind you of a
bear you'd like to meet?"
Do bears eat marmalade?
- Yeah.
- Oh, what bear eats marmalade?
- Paddington.
- Oh, that's right, he does.
-  Oh, and where's Paddington from?
- Um, the movie.
(laughing))
- So it says, "To find your last clue,
"you must zip through the trees."
"When you finally land,
look through the leaves."
- Okay.
-  Hmm.
- What does that mean?
-  How do we zip through the trees?
- So where should we go
to zip through the trees?
- I don't know.
- You can't think of anywhere
at our house where we can zip?
- Yeah.
- Where?
- Zip line.
- Zip line.
Should we go on the zip line?
-  Should we go to the zip line?
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's check the zip,
do we need the marmalade for anything?
- Yeah.
- Should we maybe have
some toast or something?
(Missy laughs)
Ollie really wants to try the marmalade.
He's trying to open,
oh no, all you gotta do
is turn it buddy, it's a little hard.
-  There's you go.
-  There you go.
(sniffs)
-  What's it smell like?
- Smells, smells not good.
-  How's it taste?
- Good.
-  Yeah?
-  Yeah.
-  So that's what Paddington likes?
- Yeah.
-  Wow.
-  Wow.
- Finn, you like Paddington, huh?
- Yeah.
- Did you know Paddington loves marmalade?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you wanna try it? No?
Do you know where Paddington is from?
- Yeah.
- He's from London, right?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, London.
- Yeah London.
That's probably why all
these messages have had,
little British words and stuff, huh?
-  Yeah.
(Finn vocalizing)
- Okay, well let's go
and see if we can zip
through some trees somewhere.
Do you know anywhere on our
property where we can do that?
- Yeah, zip line.
-  Let's go to that zip line, okay?
- Yeah, to our zip line.
- Come on, boys.
We are headed to go
find the very last clue,
to zip through the
trees, and hopefully find
a Valentine's Day treasure box, huh?
Do you see any clues from here?
- No.
- Maybe we should head down there.
It seems like when we
do what the clue says,
we can find the next clue,
that's pretty cool, huh?
-  Yeah.
- Yeah.
Okay, so who wants to
zip line first? Finn?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, Finn will zip
line and then you will, okay?
- Okay.
- All right, I am waiting
at the end of the zip line,
and I think Finn is going first.
Here comes Finny.
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, I caught you.
Hey, buddy.
- Hey.
-  What that fun?
- Yeah.
- All right, grab the rope, and then go
bring it back to Ollie, okay?
There you go, go, go, go, go, go. (laughs)
And here comes Ollie.
(Ollie yells)
Woohoo, I caught you.
All right guys, now that we're
at the end of the zip line,
we gotta find some leaves, Finn.
Ollie, do you see any leaves?
What's that?
A clue.
-  A clue.
- I found the last clue.
-  Yes, we only
have one more clue left,
open it up, Ollie.
- Okay.
-  You guys ready to go
find some treasure? (laughs)
Ooh, what are those, Ollie?
- Keys.
-  Ooh, okay,
let's see what it says.
"You found the keys, I knew you would."
"Hopping on some wheels
will do you some good."
"You're such good boys,
the greatest of blokes."
"The treasure you seek
is hidden under the oak."
- Oak?
- Do you know what an oak is?
- No.
- So, we have oak trees on our property.
- Is that an oak tree?
- Nope, not that one.
-  I think it's
the biggest tree, dude.
- We gotta go find the biggest oak tree.
-  And it said
to hop on some wheels,
so maybe we should just
hop in this Polaris, right?
- Yeah.
-  All right, you got the key?
- Yep.
-  Okay, hang onto the key,
let's hop onto the Polaris.
Are you ready, Finn?
- Yeah.
-  You gonna ride
back here with the dogs?
- Yeah
(Brad laughs)
-  All right,
boys are all loaded up.
-  Yep, we got the door shut.
We got seat belts on.
-  Yep.
Dogs are ready.
- Gonna go see if we can find
some treasure, right boys?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
-  And you got your key?
- Yep.
-  Okay, let's go.
(engine starts)
-  Alright.
- Here we go.
- Here we go guys.
Should we head to the great
oak tree on our property?
-  Yep.
- Yeah.
- Okay, I hope the treasure's there.
-  Me too.
-  Yeah.
- Is that an oak tree right there?
I think that is it.
- I think that big one is.
That's our big old oak tree.
(lively music)
We're getting close.
I think we can park right here
and then we got to check under this tree.
That was a fun ride huh?
-  Yeah.
- There we go.
This is the big oak tree.
We should go look under it huh?
See if we see anything.
Wow, it's messy down here.
- There's a treasure box, look behind you.
-  What?
-  Oh my gosh.
- Look right there.
-  What? Oh,
there is a treasure box.
That is so cool.
-  Open it.
-  Let's take it back to the house
and then open it okay?
Does that key fit?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, let's take it back
to the house and open it okay?
- Okay.
-  You want to carry it?
-  Yeah.
-  Grab a handle boys.
Come on Finn, let's climb up.
-  Isn't it a cool treasure box?
-  I know.
I could not believe we
found a treasure box.
We're gonna have to take this back
up to the house, see if we
can open that old lock huh?
(Finn jabbers)
Are you so excited?
I can't believe we
found treasure you guys.
We found an actual treasure box.
Look at this thing.
It's so detailed and nice.
(slow music)
Alright Ollie, do you know what to do?
-  Yeah.
-  The key.
-  You put the
key in and now turn it.
Other way maybe? Try the other way.
(gasps) It came undone.
Are you ready?
- Yeah.
-  Open it up.
- Wow.
-  What is it?
- Lots of candy.
(Finn yells)
-  Paddington?
Look at all these goodies Ollie.
You have you own Paddington Bear.
And a book, Love From The
Very Hungry Caterpillar.
- M&Ms.
-  That's so cool.
Ollie is really excited
about the gems huh?
- Yeah.
-  It came with little hearts.
And it also came with blue diamonds
and pink diamonds, look at that.
Please look after this bear, thank you.
Can you guys look after these bears?
- Yeah.
(slow music)
-  You get Sweet Tarts.
Paddington Bear.
-  I don't like this.
-  You don't like those?
-  No.
-  Alright mom
and dad will eat these.
-  Yeah we will. (laughs)
And a new book to read
tonight for bed time.
Was that so fun boys?
- Yeah.
-  Treasure hunts are awesome huh?
- Yeah.
- You guys want to open your Kinder Eggs?
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah.
-  They're really excited to see
what's inside the Kinder Eggs.
-  Ohh, what's that.
-  Ohh, chocolate.
I didn't know it came with a little spoon.
-  I know, I didn't either.
Look Finn.
-  Oh then it's got
a little build toy to do.
-  You get to put together a toy.
-  So one side is
candy and one side is a toy?
-  Yeah.
-  Oh that's so fun.
I'm not really sure what
that stuff is. (laughs)
-  It's chocolate?
-  It's some sort
of creamy, sweet stuff.
-  You want to try it?
(lively music)
- Mmm, it actually tastes
like, I don't know.
That is the weirdest flavor.
It's sweet, it's yummy, it's not bad.
Do you guys know what that is?
Let us know down below
in the comments below
if you know what the Kinder Eggs
have inside of them for sweets.
Oh did you get a little toy too Ollie?
-  Yeah.
-  Oh it's a skateboard.
That is so cool dude.
Finn's really liking the chocolate
and you like the toy. (laughs)
-  He ate the
chocolate wafer thing.
I don't know what it is.
Is it good?
(laughing)
-  He's into it.
(lively music)
What are you doing Ollie?
- I'm putting gems in my backpack too.
-  You're putting
some gems in your backpack?
- Yeah.
