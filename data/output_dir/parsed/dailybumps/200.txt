-  Hey Ollie, what are you doing?
Hashtag Ollie meditating.
I'm not sure he's ever.
Does he know what he's doing? (laughing)
- I don't know.
-  What's wrong
with him? (laughing)
(upbeat music)
♫ Wherever you are,
that's where I wanna be
♫ All it took was was a
laugh in that soft sunset
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said
♫ This is home
♫ Just running around,
you've never looked so cute
♫ Hugging you tight.
Cuddling all I could saying
♫ I am home
♫ Home's wherever you're with me
- Good morning! (laughing)
You were just sitting
there smiling, weren't you?
Today we are gonna show you
our Starbucks of the day
because, instead of getting
dressed today, we got Starbucks.
(laughing)
(baby mumbling)
- Like hot chocolate.
- That was like hot chocolate?
So he got a Tuxedo Hot Chocolate.
Same as mommmy, and Finn
got a Spicy Milk, huh?
It's got, like, all kinds of spices in it.
- Yeah!
-  Yeah.
So today is Sunday.
We were all planning to go to church
but then a few people woke up sick,
and it's like a different
sickness than mine
'cause I've been sick
the last couple of days,
and it's been kinda
just, like, a head-cold,
which has not been fun at all,
but Luke, from Carl and Ginger,
woke up, and he was sick.
He actually threw up, but he
thinks it might've just been,
like, junk food that they ate,
but then Bryan woke up sick, too.
Like, his stomach hurts,
and he hasn't thrown up,
but he's not feeling very well either.
It seems to be different than what I have,
which is a bummer because I'm like, great.
Now I'm gonna get what Bryan
got, but I guess we'll see.
So, we ended up calling off church,
and we're just gonna rest at home today,
and everyone's just gonna
hopefully get better.
So, I actually just ran
and got some Starbucks
and got a few essentials,
some medicine, and some food,
so that we don't have to
leave the house again.
Just make dinner at home tonight.
So, we're just buckling in
today, and we're gonna just rest
and hang out as a family, and
I might even jump in the pool
a little bit and swim and
have some fun, so, yay!
- Good morning guys, and
check out my wall plant.
I put this up last night.
I got all these plants from Home Depot.
I wrapped the roots.
I put them in the little
wall-hanger thing.
Now, they're just in my office,
in my little sitting area.
I think it looks so cool,
but anyway, it is a beautiful day,
and we are all kinda not feeling so well.
So, we are just hanging
out at home and relaxing,
and I'm getting some work done
in my office, actually, too.
(knocking)
- Come in! What's up dude?
- There's a grasshopper in,
in Finn's bathroom!
-  There is?
- Yeah!
-  Let's go see!
Alright Ollie, we are in the
bathroom. What is in here?
- A grasshopper right
next to the trash can.
-  Seriously?
- Yeah!
-  Okay, let's go see.
- It's right there. Look at.
-  Wow!
-  Yeah (mumbles).
-  That is a grasshopper, isn't it?
- Yeah, let's get a towel.
-  Why?
- Because.
-  You wanna get it?
- Yeah.
(laughing)
- I wanna get it.
-  I don't know if a
towel's the best thing, Ollie.
How about a cup?
- Oh, yeah!
-  We have acquired a plastic cup.
-  I see it move. Did you get it?
-  Yeah, it's moving, huh?
-  Ooh.
-  Got it!
- Oh my gosh! It's moving! Oh my gosh!
-  We got him Ollie.
-  Yes!
-  Let's get the lid on.
-  Oh yeah, that, that, come on!
Get him in there. He
go in there (mumbles).
-  Oh, oh, oh, oh! There we go.
-  Ha! We got him!
-  We got him.
- Yes.
- He actually looks like he may be hurt,
so we are going to set him free
and see if that makes him better.
Alright Ollie, I think we should put him
on this big rock up here.
We've got a good rock right here.
I bet he would like it
here. What do you think?
Good!
-  Okay.
Alright buddy.
-  Bye!
-  Say bye!
- Bye!
(soft country music)
- Giving our air plants
a bath 'cause I was just
doing some reading that they actually need
a good 20 to 30 minute
soak, once a week in water.
So, they've been soaking here
for a good amount of time.
I'm gonna pull 'em out and
let 'em dry up in the sun,
which is also what you're
supposed to do, I guess.
(soft country music)
While, I put my air
plants over here to dry,
check out these flowers that
are coming in right now.
This is so cool.
I love how there's always,
like, a different plant
or flower in bloom at our place.
These ones are really cool.
They're, like, bright yellow.
Ooh, they're really strong, too.
(soft country music)
If you guys watched yesterday's video,
you saw that we have
a plethora of Wubble Bubble Balls.
Be sure to go watch yesterday's
video link in the I-Card.
What should we do with them today, Ollie?
- Put them in the pool!
-  We should?
-  Yeah!
-  What do you
think, Finn? In the pool?
- Yeah! (laughing)
-  Look at all these.
- It's actually a little
freaky waking up next to them.
-  Yeah, it was a little weird.
Alright, let's put 'em in the pool!
Alright, we are carrying
them to the pool area.
This is gonna be cool.
(upbeat country music)
- And there you have it, guys!
A pool full of Wubble
Bubble Balls (laughing).
- It's so fun!
-  They seriously are so fun.
They hover for a little bit.
- Yeah.
(upbeat techno music)
(laughing)
- I love it!
(upbeat techno music)
- Swimming pool Wubble Bubble!
- Let's go!
- Yes.
(upbeat techno music)
- Whoa, hoo, hoo, hoo!
(upbeat techno music)
- This is so cool, Ollie!
-  I know!
- Our whole pool is full
of Wubble Bubbles! What?
- Get down!
- Get down!
- Yeah!
- Is this so cool dude?
- Yeah!
(laughing)
-  Whoa! Catch it!
-  Ah! They're launching 'em at us!
-  Yeah, I know.
-  Ah!
- Let's go under.
-  Yeah.
(upbeat techno music)
-  Come on, Finn! Who hoo!
Look at all these Wubbles dude! (laughing)
Isn't that so cool?
- Yeah!
(upbeat techno music)
-  Finn, what are you doing?
- Nothing.
-  Is that a banana?
- Yeah.
-  That was so good of you!
So this is, what is this one?
- Nana.
-  Banana. And what's this one?
- Mama.
-  Mama? (laughs)
That would be milk. Do you know this one?
- Box.
-  Mailbox.
What are we doing in here, babe?
- Well, you asked for something pumpkiny.
-  I.
- So, I went in the kitchen,
and I was like, oh, I'm gonna
make him something pumpkiny.
-  I definitely needed
something pumpkiny you guys.
(laughing)
So what are you making?
- I'm making chocolate
chip pumpkin cookies.
-  Yes!
- You really wanted, like, a pie,
but I don't have any evaporated milk, so.
- Yeah I really wanted, I
actually wanted Pumpkin Pasties,
which are, like, what
they have in Harry Potter.
They're like little hand-pies.
- I've made 'em before.
-  Yeah, they're super good.
- But I just didn't have
the right ingredients,
and no one wants to go to the store.
-  Yeah.
(laughing)
- So, yeah. I'm just gonna
make up some cookies.
-  Well, it looks good.
- I've always got pumpkin in
the pantry. I don't know why.
(upbeat music)
- The Wubbles are going crazy!
-  They are, huh?
- I wanna go, too!
-  So, all the Wubble Bubble Balls
have come out of the pool.
There are none in the pool anymore.
You wanna see?
- Yeah! Yes!
-  Come on, Finn! Come on!
We gotta save the Wubbles!
Check this out you guys,
on the air conditioner.
(laughing)
- I'm going to punch it.
- Punch it! Oh, whoa!
Look at it spin, dude!
(laughing)
Yes, the Wubbles are all just
trying to escape right now.
Look at that one's trying to
get a boost over the fence.
There's already a couple over there.
It's a crazy life with
these Wubble Bubble Balls.
It's so funny though, they
seriously do act like,
but like a ball, too.
Oh, that one bounced
-  Oh no!
- Oops! Sorry! Aw, no!
-  It's in jail!
-  (laughing) I think
these ones are in jail.
That's why they're trying to escape.
Look at that pink ones about to escape!
- Got you! Ah!
(laughing)
- Seriously, this is so cool. Boing!
-  Boing!
-  Boing! (laughing)
These look incredible!
-  They're kinda tiny.
-  What is it?
-  They're what?
- They're kinda tiny.
- I kinda love them.
-  Well, good.
-  Could I try one?
-  After you eat your dinner.
(kids yelling)
-  Whoa!
Someone's got the moves, and
you ate your whole dinner, huh?
- Yeah.
-  That means you get a cookie!
- You tried to sneak a bite!
-  What?
- (laughing) I don't know.
-  Sometimes he says
random things like that.
(baby yelling)
-  How is it, Ollie?
- Good!
-  Good? You promise?
You like it? Yay, I'm so glad you like it!
-  Finn, you had
to eat your dinner, okay?
- (crying) Cookie.
- He's like, cookie, now!
- You are wonderful!
- Oh, thank you!
You're the cutest!
(laughing)
-  Hey Ollie, what are you doing?

Does he know what he's doing? (laughing)
- I don't know.
Ollie, what are you doing bud?
Did you watch this in a movie?
-  Do you do this at school?
What's wrong with him? (laughing)
-  Do you feel better now?
(laughing)

from Ninjago. (laughing)

- Yeah.
