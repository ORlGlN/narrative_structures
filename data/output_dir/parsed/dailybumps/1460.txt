good morning ollie what do you do it
well well he's playing on his toy box
normally he crawls inside his toy box
but he's crawling on top of it now
trying something new this morning
ah
big guys think the bomb they're very
nice of you
this is our sign daily
do amazing things
good morning cover aah he's given you
morning kisses okay you're really going
overboard karma okay back off back off
the baby back off the baby good morning
you guys so this morning or last night I
should say this diddle guy you always
keep it interesting don't you let's not
play under the bed
he slept really good in his crib until
what would you say about like - it was
it was even later than usual he did
sleep until - after that I feel like
he's doing better in the crib but I
honestly think that the crib is
hindering us because it is a mini crib
and it's not as comfortable and he slept
until about 2:00 and she put him back to
sleep and then he slept till about 3:00
and then I put him back to sleep
slept for maybe half hour I put him back
to sleep again and then at like 4:00 he
was in our bed and we're like we're done
we gave up so how does he do when he's
in our bed and he's come up to us great
anywhere he actually got I don't think
he likes sleeping in our bed very much
yeah are you sick of us he's like I want
people my own yeah doesn't like his bed
and he doesn't like and I don't know but
he just sleep it took me a while to get
him comfortable when you like had to
yeah I know we talked about him sleeping
a lot but that's just because it's
really like a big part in our lives
right now it's trying to get him on a
consistent sleeping schedule cuz the
more he sleeps and the better he sleeps
the better all our lives are I'm alright
can I get an amen
hey Holly what you doing he's helping
he's helping hang clothes see maybe a
little tangled in this oh he was chewing
on it those teeth go on everything huh
okay I like that actually I just got off
the phone with Spreadshirt who runs our
merch shop and they wanted to call me
basically and say
they're blown away by you guys because
so many people are buying the new
hoodies which is awesome and I didn't
wanna let you guys know that today the
day you're watching this on the 4th is
the last day to use that code pot of
gold to get $10 off your order of $50 or
more so if you guys wanted to take
advantage of that go do it because it's
almost gone he's reaching you want
another toy grab the book you're not
gonna read the book who are you kidding
yourself you can actually read it
pika boo
so yeah they were actually really blown
away and they are going to basically
revamp our entire site and even have
some cool designers who we get to work
with and make cool things for you guys
so really excited about that because I'm
a busy guy and all that stuff kind of
gets put on the back burner a lot
because I just simply don't have time to
go he's like you really want to read the
book huh
grab it there you go
oh that's not how you read I've got all
I down for his second nap really happy
about cuz we're actually going to go to
swimming today he's at open swim but
we're also going to take some six-month
photos actually it's really confusing
because they're his six-month photos but
he's actually 7 months now but that's
beside the point we're gonna go take
pictures of him um while we're at swim
so I'm really excited because I feel
like that swimming is just like a big
deal for us um it's something new that
he started doing at six months and I
felt like they should be included in his
pictures let it go let it go there's no
holding back anymore let it go let it go
how do i turn my windshield wipers off
that makes them go faster how about that
performance last night the Oscars you
guys by adeana
is I say her name Adina that was pretty
cool and I will say I'm glad we watched
frozen just before it frozen is good I I
wish we had like a kid who could
appreciate it but what you guys think
did you guys watch the let it go
performance she sort of cracked at the
but she was Belle today I'm actually
making some sweet potatoes right now for
him just to freeze and stuff but I
really wanted to do I like yams better
yams are actually much more nutritional
but the yams that we have in the store
are just like a yellow or white color
they're not orange like how you would
purchase them in like a can or if you
were to buy like the baby food jars I
wanted to try yams I'm sorry I wanted to
try sweet potatoes and I feel like oh no
is this super oh I'm all my stuff okay I
wanted to try these sweet potato yams
these are yams sweet potatoes are more
nutritional something smells rotten in
this car and missing I cleaned it out we
got all the trash out there's like no
food or wet towels or anything no idea
where the smell is coming from but our
little uh air freshener thing is like
emptying all nasty stuff so you're gonna
have to get a new one of those because
it reeks in here
I hate that smelly car and then like
it's kind of too cold I don't wanna roll
down the windows and let all the cold
air in cold ha ha ha ha it's 64 degrees
up Brian you're funny
oh hey yo you up for your nap he took a
pretty mini nap but that's fine because
um I kind of was expecting to take one
since we're going to swimming actually
it's like I'm gonna start really soon
just waiting for brining at home but
yams are done I got to figure out where
the top is
there's my yams look pretty good
actually they look better with a little
bit of brown sugar and marshmallows on
them if you ask me but this is oli so
he's not gonna be hitting bad chop these
up and then I actually just got these
new containers they're really cool
because they have this soft power on the
bottom so you can pop out like your
frozen pieces if you store in the
freezer I just like pops it out like
that which i think is really cool so we
actually just breathe stop it not
expected since I always put my halo your
basement so stop oh I'm gonna do to you
my religion
nothing's lethal it's really battle he's
leaning down for me we actually just got
um all these photos from the other day
