ya know that was my husband I do it
heavy look em up he's so happy yeah
daredevil like your brother that's
adorable so today is Friday ollie is
taking a nap and we really wanted to do
something fun with him today like take
him maybe to go see Santa a mall or go
to the movie theater but I was seriously
just scrolling through my Twitter and I
saw this post of this text message
conversation going around saying that
there are terrorist threats to malls and
to movie theaters in the Inland Empire
today which is where we live we we kind
of don't know what to make of it it
might be fake it could be real yeah do
you take it seriously or do you let it
affect your life yeah and seriously like
today it was confirmed that the attack
30 minutes away from us was a terrorist
attack
yeah it's just crazy that this is the
world we live in you know it just sucks
that we have to sit here and make a
decision like should we go to the mall
you know should we take our kids to go
see Santa today yeah like that's a hard
thing to have to decide so we're kind of
sitting here trying to think of
alternatives or other things we could do
just crazy it's crazy that an attack
like that happened so close it's
just so sad and so many innocent people
lost their lives and it's not the way it
should be trying to decide what to do I
think we may just go to like a less busy
part of town which actually might be
nice anyway because it's Friday yeah
we'll sit potent quota away from the
mall just yeah I've been saying the
kindest just don't be in big crowds
how are you filling me the burden I'm
feeling the burn
he's happy and he's asleep I can't do it
anymore

my kid who was your favorite character
spotlight
what a spot do yes he does
I'm freaking out now because were
howling I thought he was you love the
dinosaurs which of course he did but he
loved the little boy's spot she just
couldn't stop acting like spot
afterwards he was like he looks inviting
everything and it was so cute what we
got yeah
or that's Ramsey Ramsey arlo wrestler
I'm getting spot right now like spot she
had to remember what we actually got him
this plush spot and at the time we
didn't really know who it was so we'll
have to get it out and see if he knows
who it is know who's that
that's fine our low sauce right in
his spot right are low but I'm right
there and then he goes
that's so cool that's him
will he go but yeah we saw the good
dinosaur and it was a really good movie
it looked really cool it was super cute
I did notice a lot of similarities to
the Lion King probably almost a dozen
plot elements that were like exactly
like The Lion King which is interesting
because they are both Disney although
the good dinosaurs Pixar it's an
interesting kind of movie to be honest
if there was some scary sauce in it yeah
and some downright weird spots show but
all he loved all the dinosaurs were they
like got high go he got he got drunk off
the old fruit yeah hi buddy hi he's so
big right now why would you go to sleep
