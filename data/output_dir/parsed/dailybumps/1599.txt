guy sleepy smiles he's get sleepy smiles
we're sitting on set it read waited from
he's been so good just sleeping dreaming
about muddy boobies oh the cool thing
about this race actually it's to raise
funds for organizations that help with
things like bullying and schools and
cyber bullying and you know being on
YouTube and sort of in the Internet
realm we kind of have experience with
this obviously we have experienced
bullying online a lot of people have I
mean it's set up to like 90% of kids in
school nowadays are bullied and I don't
think I've ever talked about it but in
high school I was very much bullied I
was called names I was a loner for the
longest time there were times when I had
maybe one or two friends at a time but
it wasn't until really like Missy came
into school and we became friends and I
was able to just like distance myself
from that so if any of you guys are out
there and you know you're being bullied
I encourage you to speak up because it's
not gonna get fixed if you don't speak
up and I know a lot of people are afraid
of like repercussions if they speak up
of being bullied but it's a big thing in
schools nowadays it's not something that
you have to be ashamed of because it's
not your fault it's the bullies problem
it's not the person being bullied so
just know that and I just want to like
build you guys up and just know that
there are people out there who care
about you and life is so much different
outside of school you really don't have
to worry about that then insects that
kids nowadays have to worry about that
and let me know in the comments though
if you guys you know have been bullied
or your bullying story or if you ended
up how you were able to get through it
and just like leave some positivity for
other people who are coming here who may
have been bullied people need to know
what they can do you got to dive
you got this you got this babe you look
great you guys you're not done yet you
got a 20 foot mud hill to climb crazy
the person that lost their shoe lost
their sock to go go go kasi go kasi go

good moisturizer naturally so Brian just
