hey guys welcome to the vlog I know that
we have been promising a like huge
surprise something super special and
today we're gonna tell them are we going
to tell them I think I think it's time
you think it's time to tell them I don't
think we can hold it back any further
any longer okay well here is the
surprise yep
we are in a completely different room
not just room but house you know so far
okay look at how steep these two CS
we're going oh my god I did did you
really I did good morning guys obviously
future Brian told you guys we are moving
yep
it's moving day this is our last day in
this house right now I'm just trying to
take this all in everything is put into
boxes and we're just getting ready I
mean to like throw stuff in the in the
moving truck so my buddies John is
coming over with his movie truck because
he actually owns a moving company which
is totally convenient if you guys are
looking for a friend something that's
really cool is ask if they want a moving
company because that's like when it
comes down to like who your true friends
are like who really helps you move these
are our boxes full of all our stuff and
like everything's taken down over there
and oh hey look it's Bob actually don't
know if he can talk anymore because he's
looking a little like he's got some
stuff going on how you feelin though Bob
yeah I think he lost the ability to talk
so we
headed to our new house so crazy I know
you guys are probably going what the
heck is going on but yep we're going to
our new house me and my parents are
gonna go there and just open it up and
get everything ready so that we can
start moving everything in it's going to
be a crazy day but I'm super excited
we're gonna load this baby up and
sitting in our new backyard waiting for
the boys to get here with all of our
stuff but I'm just I just probably the
one thing I fell in love with is this
backyard I can't wait to have karma be
able to just play and just really
excited I can't believe that we are
doing this it's so crazy Internet has
been hooked up and still waiting for I'm
going to show up but I was I'm sitting
here I have to go to the bathroom so
badly I have to pee like really really
bad so I decided what a great way to
meet our neighbors I walk over there
show them I'm pregnant and let him know
that I would really really appreciate if
they would let me use their bathroom but
I knocked on the door no one answered so
I started searching the house for
something that I could go to use so I
can go to the bathroom cuz obviously any
toilet paper and I found something so I
was able to go pee that solves of that
problem but I'll show you guys the
coolest thing about mine and Bynes
bedroom are you ready guys this is this
is really cool we have a fireplace and a
huge tub oh it's gonna be so nice like
this house so so nice we were so happy
so excited I know you guys are still
college going what the heck what's going
on
promise you will answer all your
questions very soon so we got the first
load in the big old moving truck behind
us and we are headed to the house this
is the first stuff that would bring in
it's probably gonna be an all-day thing
because we have losses that Cara is
about
check out his new home free big boy
can you live here can you do this wow
you guys be burgers there's so much more
room oh my gosh he just cleared that
we are not going to be saying the words
squirrel here because he started this
thing at our old house where he likes to
climb the trees for the squirrels and so
we refused to say it because he became
addicted to like climbing the tree every
single time we got near the door he run
out there and took climbing the tree to
look for squirrels there's no squirrels
here we're not going to talk about
squirrels till it goes in that room
right there yeah oh man does alright
we're moving stuff in finally getting
things going we've just started this
room is probably going to be so crazy
crowded and we've got just a few things
Kharma really wants to come in or so he
really probably just wants someone to
come out there and play with him but you
gotta just relax okay play with you
later
oh yeah about to move this couch and I
just found 48 sets so I can get like
half an ice-cream cone they're nice the
boys are starting to slow down yeah hard
oh yeah we gotta get everything going
they need to have everything here today
moved and I've already done my job which
is organize the entire kitchen oh yeah
you want to show on that whole boxes
well this is all of the rooms like the
bedroom stuff I can't organized
everyone's bedroom I will be organizing
our bedroom though very soon but anyways
we are going to go grab them so much
because they're probably all starving to
death and if we don't feed them then
they're probably not gonna work very
hard he's like no don't show them this
because this is bad packing but this is
our second load and we are going to
throw it all in the house now
starting to get stuff loaded in here
still very blank what we got is our bed
or mattress right now so hopefully we'll
get oh so tiring moving sucks you guys
moving sucks we're going to get this big
old couch to the other level
and I'm feeling like
moment going on okay I do the short
straw so I get to go up first
hang on okay
we have it nope keep flipping it
we're flipping all right okay are you
listening me no I'm dead serious
what was there know what's on the top oh
wait everyone that oh hold on okay don't
drop it over the banister okay whoo this
is good right we can sit on it like this
we are getting a much-deserved lunch
break and Missy actually even went to
Chipotle gummy Chipotle even though
everyone got something else but I'm
pretty sure that I probably burned like
three times more calories than this
burrito is gonna take me yes today
taking the crib out very very carefully
we had to take the actual door off just
so the crib would fit through it because
we assembled the crib inside the room so
we would have never have gotten it in we
have a little bit more do you want to
take it out cribs are meant to stay in
the room they're assembled then I guess
all right guys well everything is packed
up and put into the moving truck and
whole house is almost pretty much empty
so we're getting ready to go over to the
other house now you know this house
brought it got us to California you know
so we're really grateful for what it's
done but we just hope through it you
know what I mean our family's just
getting big and we need room but we are
really grateful for this house because I
mean without this house we probably
would still be stuck in Idaho now
everything's in the moving truck and
this is pretty much our last trip to the
other house this is seriously like my
favorite thing I know already said that
but karma is like loving it back here
and he's actually paying frizzier now
which is really funny we're moving on to
bigger and better things
you know guys meaning yeah it's always
kind of a little sad
when you're leaving a house and you're
going into a new one because you made a
lot of cool memories I mean we did have
a lot of really really great memories in
the house we were in the house when we
started doing YouTube we run that house
when we decided we wanted to start
trying for a family and like I said you
know but we are super grateful for what
that house has really offered us and
we're excited because this new house is
going to give us so many more memories
and we're going to be able to have so
much fun and have so much more room for
all of our so that's something that we
we can get to look forward to yeah good
job karma car is pretty much packed to
the brim and I even got Missy's hospital
bag in the front seat I didn't wanna put
the hospital back in the back of the car
because our back of a moving truck
because I thought what if we get to the
house and the bag is in the back of the
moving truck and Missy goes into labor
when we have to leave it's like oh okay
climb through that moving truck and get
back so I have it closed just in case
and we're gonna film my video there's so
many videos we have to film right now
we're just so busy and on top of that
we're moving and on top of that Macy's 9
months pregnant so it's definitely been
a crazy stressful week good joke karma
she totally looks at you for like it
approval like did I do good without it
so John and I are b-dub and we are
and on some wing and wing and wing the
wings and I know these really aren't
wings these are pretty much just adult
chicken nuggets right pretty much why
don't you know what we deserved it we
work hard and I want to give a shout out
to John right here he helped us so much
today
he gave us a 17-foot truck and coming
out like eight hours of moving
it was very trip three trip this guy
this guy's a true friend right here so
we're going to Mack on these wings my
favorite b-t-dub
Asian ting I just had b-t-dub and where
I pick up that was weird
thumbs up for that that was pretty
awesome oh my gosh this is such a
ridiculously crazy day but we are headed
back to the house to grab a couple of
more things but we basically have
everything out of there we are
officially in this house it's been so
long a day and it's still going
Brian's left to go out with on John and
hang out but he threw everything that
he's been doing he actually set up all
these base for his car seat which is
super cool but I actually have to take
it apart because I have to drive people
in the car oh I don't think Brian
understands that it's actually gonna go
to the other side because if I'm sitting
here I need to be able to get to him but
yeah I'm trying to get a few items into
my room and I figured out the perfect
job for karma watch this
come on get my pillow nope go get my
pillow get the pillow come on right here
go boy
thank you stop it stop it
go get your boy come on come on good get
diet
Joe many commands go boy thank you
I mean come on what more can you ask for
a dog that like goes and gets things for
you that's pretty awesome I've got an
obviously the rooms not completely
together but I'm gonna give you a little
bit of a room tour so you guys can see
kind of what we've got going on
so there's Brian's desk and of course
his fridge and now we have a couch in
our room which is looking seeing I love
that we have a couch in our room right
yeah and I catch it actually the only
thing that I can sit on that actually is
like very supportive on my belly so I
wait for real yeah whoa so it's actually
quite comfortable the couch is looking
at our TV um
which then our bed is right over there
and there's our fans it's really hot
today we're trying to cool the house
then here's all of our stuff but yes
there's a fireplace in our bedroom which
then leads right to the tub okay I do
you think we're spoiled yet yeah thanks
and then we have our closet shower and
toilet room so yeah my gosh I cannot
rush
bedtime if you can't tell I'm so tired I
got like two hours of sleep last night
this tub is gonna be so cool to actually
bathe Oliver in because it's got like a
seat right there it's gonna be like
that's the great scene that was once we
get out or like take a bath but our
grass is always just so cramped and so
hard to get yeah well I feel like this
will be so much easier
yeah but I love our room I love our
bathroom area our sinks if you don't
know
in earlier vlogs in our bedroom our
bedroom used to be green and we painted
it that's what we're stuck with the
great the green is like following it's
like wanting us you guys yeah but it
doesn't bug me as much here because we
don't have green carpet anymore so
that's true
we have blue carpet okay whatever
green walls and blue carpet uh I got
here but obviously you guys are probably
wondering what the hell is going on why
are they in a new house ah we haven't
really shown you guys all wolves we can
do that tomorrow it's getting really
late but we wanted to sort of explain
what's going on what about the nursery
that you just painted um basically an
opportunity became available for us to
leave our lease came up and our landlord
said we can renew but she was thinking
about selling so we were like well we're
in a pretty small bedroom all those
quite large but I mean Oliver only has a
corner and so we decided to cease the
moment take the risk and find another
house and now Oliver has his own room
this house is so much bigger Oh much
bigger it has so many more rooms have a
spare room and guess what we didn't even
have to like go up in price we were able
to stick around right where we're paying
already yeah we're staying in our budget
and we're getting like so much more
space yeah we're having family we need
space he needs room we little brat he's
running out of room and he wants his own
room it was just a really great
opportunity that came up and obviously
you know your guys like well why did you
keep it a secret you know but it wasn't
necessarily a secret it was more than
it's kind of just a big decision that
you know we have a lot of people you
know I mean we have my mom my dad my
brother my sister and they all kind of
wanted to have this decision be between
our family and so we respect them and we
respect you know their privacy just as
much as you know everyone else's it was
just something that we said you know
this will be fun too for the vlog it'll
be totally crazy like all of a sudden
we've moved we're in a nicer city closer
to like the shops were closer to work or
closer to like a ton of cool things it
was just a really awesome opportunity
could not pass it down you guys and
Karma's super happy oh he loves it yeah
I mean we are still a multi-generational
household and I know a lot of people are
gonna understand that but it's 2013 you
know people live people live differently
yeah you know and it's like we can help
we can help out Macy's family and they
can help out us and we can live in this
amazing house can we love each other and
we can still have enough money to be
comfortable you know what I mean yeah so
that's what I mean basically a
multi-generational household is about it
we're still doing that obviously like
our our end goal is still probably to
have our own place someday but that's
going to come when it comes you know and
this is going to be a really great place
for us to be comfortable and to work up
toward that I think between this space
our bathroom our closet Oliver's room we
probably have just as much square
footage if not more if we have like our
own mobile apartment yeah first shirt
really late we put this whole room
together so we're gonna end the vlog but
we just want to thank you guys for one
