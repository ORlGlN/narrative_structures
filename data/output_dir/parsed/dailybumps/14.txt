-  Good morning!
- What are we doing today?
- We're going to Disneyland!
- Yeah!
(bell dings)
- Disney!
- Finn is actually not
going to Disneyland.
(laughs) He is gonna stay here,
he might meet up with us
if we end up staying a
little bit longer.
He's just not totally up to par yet
and, oh, and my mom and dad were like,
we can just watch him
and hang out with him.
I think Angie's even gonna
come out and hang out with him.
(baby yells)
So he's gonna go get ice cream today, huh?
- Yeah
- But he has to wear the same thing
Ollie is wearing so he's wearing
the Mickey Mouse stuff, huh.
- So I'm just wearing a Mickey Mouse top.
- Yes and we gotta do your hair, huh?
- Yeah
- Let's hurry and get you all ready.
We gotta go to Disneyland, yay!
(upbeat music)
- Ollie, where are we at?
- Disneyland!
- We made it!
It's just me and my guy today.
Finn stayed home and was
a little bummed out
but I think he'll be happier
and we're with our friends,
Ginger and Kyle and Gage and Luke.
And we are so excited
to have a big kid Disney day, huh?
- Yeah!
- What are you so excited to go on today?
- The drop one.
- He seriously wants to go on
Guardians of the Galaxy.
Did I tell you baby, I went a few days ago
with my friends and it was so scary.
(upbeat music)
Alright, first ride is Toy Story
and I don't know if Luke knows
how good I am at this game.
Are you ready?
- Okay, let's see.
(upbeat music)
- Alright, how did we do?
- I got 22,000 points.
- Oh, I got 63,000 points!
- I guess you do play
this a lot more than me.
- I do play it a lot and I had to get good
at with playing with a baby on my lap.
- Oh!
- So...
- That, she's a pro.
- Exactly, I mean, I'm just--
- She's a pro
(upbeat music)
- Hi!
- Hi!
(Missy laughs)
(Woman yells)
-  Wow, that's good!
Ollie how'd you do?
- Good.
-  Did you do good?
High five.
- I did so good.
- You did, alright guys,
we are in a really long line
right now and one way
to always get by long lines
is playing games.
We're playing Head's Up.
- Okay what are the headbands
that people wear in the park all the time.
- Mickey Ears!
- Yes!
-  Woohoo! From Cinderella.
- Bippity boppity boo.
- Uh, Cinderella.
-  Yeah, what's
the person who did that?
- It's fairy godmother.
- Yeah!
-  (laughs) Woohoo, you did it.
- That was pretty good.
-  Yeah.
Alright we're doing a deck
called just for kids
and we're gonna have Ollie hold it
and see if we can get him
to guess the words, okay?
And then we're gonna help you guess, okay?
Oh this is something you put
on your hands when it's really cold out.
-  Not gloves but...
-  What do you put on your hands?
- Warm.
-  Good.
Okay, let's pass that one. (laughs)
This is something that you are.
This is something that you are
when you are really scared
but you are, you know how to be strong,
what are you?
So if you're not scared of anything,
what are you?
- Um, I fight.
-  You're brave?
- Yeah.
-  Brave?
- Brave.
-  Okay! (laughs)
Put it down, oh this is something
you use to eat your cereal.
- A spoon?
-  Yes! You did it!
Oh, this is that movie with the girl
who has really long hair
and she sings that song.
Do you know her name?
- No.
-  Do you know
who I'm talking about,
from Tangled?
- Rapunzel!
-  Rapunzel.
- Rapunzel.
-  You did so good.
You got a couple! (laughs)
He got a couple.
Alright Ollie, are we going on
your favorite ride?
- Yeah.
- What ride is this?
- Space Mountain.
-  No, Thunder Mountain
are you excited?
- Yeah.
-  Okay and you're
gonna ride with Gage.
(laughs) Is he gonna keep you safe
so you don't fall out?
- Yeah, I love him.
- Awww
alright guys you ready?
- Yeah!
-  Woo!
- You ready, Ollie?
- Bye, have a good day.
(crowd screams)
(fun music)
(crowd screams)
- I almost lost my hat!
- Here comes another
-  Ollie...
- Ready?
-  Are you ready?
Are you scared right now?
Yeah.
-  Yeah
Whoo!
-  (screaming)
-  Ollie, keep
your hands in the car!
Whoo!
Oh, my God!
(laughing)
Oh, my God!
I keep squishing you!
-  Oh, no!
There's more?
-  (screaming)
Oh, that's fine!
-  Ollie (mumbles)
- Oh my goodness!
- Wow!
- He's acting so scared.
Ollie, you didn't like it?
Your stomach went like five times!
Oh my God!
- I know what part got him.
-  Oh
- It got me, too!
-  The fire?
- Really loud.
-  Yeah.
Alright, Ollie, just went on
Thunder Mountain, and I want to know
what was your reaction?
- It was really scary.
-  Why were you so scared?
- Because it was...
-  Ollie, look to over there!
- Your allegiance should be with the
First Order!
-  Sorry!
- Be careful, Citizen!
-  Oh wow, your Disneyland trip
has been so scary!
(laughs)
I'm literally asking him about
the Thunder Mountain Ride.
So, you were scared?
- Yeah.
- Why were you scared?
- Because it was going really fast.
- It is a fast ride.
It's one of the big kid rides.
Are you telling me you don't like
Thunder Mountain anymore?
- No.
- Oh my goodness.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, those Storm Troopers just came
by and it was pretty scary.
(laughs)
(mumbles) Yeah, we are
having such a fun day with
the boys, and just hanging out.
And a fun little Mommy Son day, huh?
I think we're actually going to do
a half day so we are headed home
pretty soon here.
Are you ready to start heading out?
- Yeah.
- We got some fun stuff to take home
to Finn, and yeah, we're going to
start heading out.
Are you ready?
- Yeah.
- Ollie, where are we heading now?
- Into the LEGO store!
- Whoo! Let's go!
Wow.
So we thought we'd check out the LEGO
store really quick because Ginger
and the boys are all doing The Void
which is a really fun experience down
here at Downtown Disney.
It's like a VR Star Wars experience.
Really, really cool.
Me and Brian did it a few weeks ago.
But Ollie's too young.
- This is the one we have!
- Yeah, we have that one!
(techno music)
- Alright guys, we just ended our Disney
Day and it was so much fun.
- It was the perfect amount of time.
We only did a half day...
- Yeah.
- And it was perfect.
- So good.
We did a few rides, they did The Void.
How did you guys like it?
- Amazing!
- Oh, good!
- It's kind of scary
when you fly Darth Vader.
- I know! It's so, so fun.
If you guys have a chance
to go, check it out,
it's so cool.
- Yeah
- And I'm glad they
were able to end on that
'cause it was a pretty busy day at Disney
but at least they got to do The Void which
is really awesome.
I bet your dad would love it.
- Yeah
Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
But anyways, as you can see, it was
such a fun day that Ollie is passed
out.
- Look at him!
Just sleeping.
-  He's just passed out, asleep.
- Yep, he's exhausted.
But we actually are on our way home
and traffic is not even too bad.
We have fast track so we're passing
up a lot of the bad traffic.
-  This isn't
even that bad, though.
- We're passing up a lot of stuff.
We're just (mumbles) 'cause traffic can
be a bummer.
But I'm excited to go home and see Finn.
We've missed him!
So, you guys, we are going to go ahead
and end this video because we're going
to go home and relax and chill.
So make sure you give it a big thumbs up
if you guys enjoyed our Disney Day
and let us know down in the comments
what is your favorite Star Wars
character.
We did a lot of Star Wars rides today
and we want to know down below
which one your favorite Star Wars
character is and we'll see you guys
in our next video.
-  Bye!
