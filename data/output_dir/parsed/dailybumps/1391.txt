is not like it when I talk and there's
this doesn't work um and we're about to
have a really really fun day I'm
actually going to spend it with my mom
and my whole family and of course Brian
and oli
Mother's Day is gonna be just really
special thank you okay fine I'll stop
talking that is basically exactly why I
cannot nurse and vlog or be out in
public or even outside of this room if
lights are on anything he is so so
easily distracted and it's kind of a
bummer
I love nursing if there is anything
going on even to the fact that if I'm
staying in this chair and that that is
open he can't concentrate very
frustrating it's actually I will be
doing a breast feeding update to talk
about it um but anyways yeah this
Mother's Day is just gonna be so amazing
it's just so crazy that I have this
little boy and he says mom mama all the
time and he loves me and it's just so
awesome it feels so so blessed are we
gonna do oli oh you're gonna get inside
the box dude you're so funny oh your
squirrel
that's your squirrel doing down there
alright we are headed to one of those
places where you like pick out something
and then you paint it and then they like
put it in an oven and then they like
make it look all cool right I've been
wanting to do something with all his
Cambron oh yeah that's true alright
something and he was just sleeping I
think he's sleeping actually Felix
Polly's two 9s beat mom's trying to
figure out size of my
so here we picked out all our stuff I've
got a big old mug he's got a big ol
serving plate
he's got olive oil olive oil so what do
you got oh very nice
Jimmy that's a cool design either you're
gonna put the collar on there's icing in
white white White's a good color
it's really easy and in cash you big cow
oh this is so cool it could be for the
cats
yeah so now we have all these cool items
and we have to make them look nice so
now the hard part begins
so Missy's doing this thing called
bubble print hey lip is so cool
that's how it is so what you're gonna do
is
possibly
so oh wow it's that on there and you
want them just to pop naturally and then
you'll go your other color here in their
album so you blow it up really big and
then you press the plate into it right
yeah that's gonna take a while I'm sure
I started painting mine started painting
getting done ollie is so changed on this
off I'll go back out so weird
hi I'm working with an actual spongebob
right here at Asus I got this really
cool like speckly vanilla paint Oh what
happened over there oh my god and that's
how you do my spines on you you would
kind of add a key he's doing to it
we're gonna have to get blazed of course
yeah all right i sponged this cool
vanilla especially paint all over there
so it's cool because you do this you
don't know how it's gonna look after its
fired you know so I think I'm pretty
much done I don't want to touch that
anymore
we got Leo's dog bowl going take a
notice you working her match to take
over that okay I was kind of
underestimated look school can do it
buddy I believe in you
good buddy it probably tickles them on
those fingers out when the truth legit
oh that's way cool that's awesome
look at Sheila artist alright look good
she's adding some finishing touches to
the plate and you have paint on your
nose Jim is that cute okay so we're
headed to lunch with the fam but that
was so much fun I really really enjoyed
doing stuff like that and I feel like if
you go back like you'll start to really
know how to like make the perfect thing
you know to me it was just really nice
in there - yeah it's like kind of like
peaceful and quiet kind of funny because
you do all this work and you're all
excited then you have to like leave it
there so we don't actually get to see
the finished product for like a week
let's week next week yeah once it's done
it'll be like all bright and pretty and
cool looking so I'm really excited
because to win a whole week just kind of
like the bummer part I was debating on
whether I should do it early and have it
as a gift on Mother's Day or do it on
Mother's Day and I mean okay so I know
the room is a mess
and by the way I said Kay so every time
I say Kay so I think of K so like
Spanish for cheese anyway okay so I know
that the room looks like a mess but
Missy just took a really good nap and I
watched Olly and he played and stuff
while I played I'm actually playing
infamous second son and I'm really sad
because I'm about to go into the last
mission and I don't want it to be over
because this game was so freaking good
and so I'm like going around to all the
districts and like clearing them and
like I might actually beat the game with
a hundred percent I never done that
before that's thought that shows how
much I really liked that game but
Missy's up from her nap now so I think
we're gonna run and do something cool
and I don't need my sunglasses inside
happy Mother's Day Missy I'll think
zombie we are used to really good mom
I just want you to know oh I wasn't
expecting that you're too nice yeah can
I eat your brains now uh no I got the
best mothersday nap ever that was your
present buddy hey good that's very
pretty good present now I have been
banging Brian for weeks to go out
shopping for ollie because he's
literally grown out of all of his
clothes he actually only has like a few
t-shirts that you can wear now it's been
wearing like the same for teachers and
for days yes you don't really notice it
but his belly started to show like he if
you like raises Henry V he's got a
little like crop tops on so since that's
not really the style for little boys I
thought I should probably go and get him
some new clothes look they're having a
big baby sale it means they're selling
babies big ones yeah big big old babies
they're selling them know how much they
cost
I'm pretty sure that's illegal guys so
easy when we shop for ollie because we
literally like this place is awesome by
the way it's like 4050 percent off so
it's like 12 bucks for a whole set one
goose voters who is that - pajama
bottoms

shirts boom
that's like - pajamas yeah this guy
looks out every time we go shopping for
him it's the coolest huh Carter's is
awesome - and really cheap hey that's
cool I like monsters got Ollie in his
pj's he had a bath he's getting some
