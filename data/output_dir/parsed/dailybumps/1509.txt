alright here I know if I ever told you
this story but when I was little my mom
used to take us to the railroad tracks
and we'd get pennies and we'd like rub
the tar off the rail it probably was
super dangerous it was very dangerous
but we rub the top it and put it on the
railroad tracks and then the train would
come and smash it I think I've heard
those seems like they don't like still
hit the thing and they'll shoot off yeah
sometimes that's what you have to get it
to stick to it or else it will literally
impale you
