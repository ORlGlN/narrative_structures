potatoes yeah I'm fine
okay even I'm not this old how does that
does a kid I am going back to the old
days I'm over here making fresh
cranberry sauce I've got an orange zest
key kind and then I've got just like a
regular so I'm excited I don't even like
cranberry sauce but my favorite thing
usually is to make things that I don't
like to see other people enjoy it that's
like my favorite thing about
Thanksgiving usually like I make pumpkin
pies and I think I make it pretty good
but I've never tried it
I don't like pumpkin pie not weird all
right I'm facetiming my mom and sister
look at that sweet potato casserole but
what about them all over the places I
don't have marshmallows no the people
who get the pieces with no marshmallows
are gonna be upset Bev say hi I'm
hanging out in the woods but at least I
can FaceTime them that's funny
you make green bean casserole mom YUM

the turkey is coming out sitting right
there compressed Jenna looks so good

is so happy he actually stole my fork
all the work was like I eat food with a
fork that Norcross and then here is so
many other work you do not get you for
it that's a little selfish
Thanksgiving is almost over but it's not
Thanksgiving without board games so we
are all playing reverse parade which is
basically charades except all the group
acts out to one person instead of one
person acting out to everyone else it's
really fun and usually make people laugh
and I gotta say my dad hates board games
but looking and being a good sport
yeah it doesn't it doesn't matter if it
has anything to do with a game he's fun
yeah if if you can laugh at anything no
change
now it is time for a little poker via
older people I've gone to bed it's now
our time to partay yes and Ali's still
up it's actually not that late which is
kind of funny but we are all going to
play some poker
