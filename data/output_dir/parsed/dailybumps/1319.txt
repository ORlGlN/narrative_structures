I have had such a rough morning
I woke up like Keeley really dizzy to
the point where like I was like oh my
gosh I can't even like function and then
I started getting like really nauseous
because I was dizzy and so I just was
like I'm gonna take a chill pill and
relax and just take a nap and stuff and
so I've been trying to relaxing relax
and I don't feel so dizzy anymore but
now I just feel nauseous like that
dizziness has affected me somehow my mom
thinks that maybe I got like water in my
ear but I don't really feel like I did
sometimes when you get water in your ear
it makes you dizzy and gives you like
that vertigo feeling but I don't really
feel like I do so I don't know if it's
that yet I mean only took a nap at the
same time and so he's up as low good my
