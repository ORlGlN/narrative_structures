okay grandpa fill the belly you have to
feel it so big yeah is it cold
are you doing here change side with me
this is our son baby
boy do amazing things okay guys so first
of all I just want to apologize for the
short vlog today today we woke up this
morning and we kind of just got some
really really bummer news uh yeah we
about seven o'clock this morning my mom
came in to let me know that my grandpa
had passed away um I don't know exactly
what happened all I know is he well he's
been kind of sick for the past couple
weeks he went in there with went to the
hospital with I think pneumonia and then
he gotten better and he was doing
physical therapy um in like a home and
last night I think he just started like
coughing and he might have had a heart
attack or stroke we're not really sure
um but he passed away about 6:30 this
morning we actually just got back to the
hospital
saying goodbye and just spending some
time with family and everyone and it's
been kind of a hard day and we want to
like show you guys our ups and downs and
today was definitely a hard one and I
think right now we just want to focus on
you know our memories and our love that
we have for my grandpa and I have so
many amazing memories with my grandpa's
I basically lived with him when I was
younger and like our whole family just
we were super close to him and so it's
just really hard but we also love that I
mean we get to imagine him now in heaven
with my grandma who we've lost ten years
ago and he's with her finally he's
basically for ten years been saying he
just wants to go see her and so he
finally got to and it's hard for us but
we know he's really happy and he was in
heaven and he's hanging out with my girl
and Gabriel today I we were hanging out
at the hospital and I told my family
this story I don't know if you guys know
this I have an extreme I would call it
fear but it's an extreme would you call
it phobia phobia it's fear you're pretty
much afraid babe you have a phobia I
guess it's a phobia of lotion I really
can't stand it I think it's absolutely
disgusting makes me want to puke even
the word I think is disgusting and the
big reason for that is because uh one
time my grandpa maybe put lotion on his
arm
after he had a stroke and it was just
kind of like laying there and he maybe
put it on his AR and it was so gross and
um
so yeah that's one of my funny memories
and it's something I struggle with to
this day the fact that I dunno hunted
that anywhere near me I think it's gross
I don't know it's just we have so many
fun memories of my grandpa it's crazy
but I'm just so glad that he's with his
the love of his life again like he is
missed her so much and we were talking
about all these skate plans he's tried
to make to get to her cuz he just has
missed her a lot and so I'm so glad
they're together but it's gonna be hard
for us who he's been a big part of our
family I mean he's just he's so he's
just so really just a character so we're
gonna miss him I'm so glad that he got
to me all at least once and hang out
with him his little buddy so really we
were able to share too in our last visit
with him we were able to share some
videos that we did and and show him
really you know like what we've decided
to do with our life too and we've never
done that before I mean even though we
have been doing it while going to see
him the last time we were able to say
like look at what we're doing you know
and that was really cool yeah yeah it's
cool that we know we just got a lot of
time with him
mean he had a stroke about 12 years ago
that left him half of his body
completely paralyzed and he's just been
going and he really shouldn't have
probably made it much longer after that
and he he's just such a strong person
such a strong guy that he made it so
long I don't even know if it was all
happy for him I think it times he really
wanted to be with my grandma um but he
was here and it was amazing I we got to
I just remember so many times I got to
hang out with him and just talk about
grandma my grandma with him and like
like how much of amazing woman she is
and how much we missed her and we talked
about her all the time and I just I
don't know it's just it's always nice
when you have comfort and knowing that
he's with her and that they're happy and
they're there walking around right now
dancing and laughing and and it's just
amazing I mean it's sad for us but I'm
just so happy for him right now
it's actually interesting too because I
I don't know if you guys know this but
we had Gabriel cremated and we've kind
of held on to him because I I didn't
know what to do exactly I haven't really
found anything that came that was like
peaceful for me that came that was like
oh that felt right I always wanted I
always knew like the best thing for me
was knowing that Gabriel was with my
grandma and they were in heaven and
grandma was taking care of him and
holding him and you know because I can't
right now and so I never been now like
hard to explain but my grandma right now
is buried at a set at a cemetery and my
grandpa will actually buried with her
and I'm actually gonna be placing
Gabriel in there too um and they'll all
be together and that fur just really
makes me feel good knowing that they're
all together and like he gets he got to
finally meet Gabriel and
it's just it's a it's just it's a hard
day but there's there's like peace in it
too you know yeah we had some we had
some really cool moments too in the vlog
with him and I'll try and put some of
those together for you guys to to to see
but definitely just appreciate you guys
praying for us today and I'm sorry the
vlog short but it's kind of those days
we just need to take a step back and
just and enjoy each other and sort of
make plans for what we're going to do
because it's it's a big thing for the
family and there's a lot of decisions
that need to be made and stuff like that
so we just yeah we got a long week ahead
of us got a lot of things to do get
together and but you know we we do vlog
our life this is a diary of our life and
this is part of our life is lost
sometimes and we're gonna show what we
line what we can and you know it's
interesting I think that when it comes
to loss my family we we grieve really
deeply in some but we actually are we
just have such faith in such love for
just the Lord and everything that I just
think that it's it's interesting the way
we grieve is it's not it's not like it's
horrible terrible at all over it's like
a new beginning I guess yeah I think
that for us
death is sort of just the beginning and
so I think that would that's gonna be
