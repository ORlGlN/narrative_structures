today is Father's Day
if all they are up bright and early and
we're getting ready to make breakfast
for Brian I've got a few gifts for him
and I'm really excited to just celebrate
Brian today because he is such a good
dad and I feel like being a good dad
does not just have to do with like
taking care of your kid it kind of has
to do with being a good husband and
being like like a help to the mom who I
usually ends up taking on a lot of the
responsibilities but he tries to step in
wherever he can and it's just so nice
and makes him a good dad especially when
I'm pregnant cuz he can't really be a
good dad to this little boy other than
just helping me and he does really good
at that he definitely takes care of us
very well so today it's all about Brian
and so we've got guests friend me and
all I've been crying something special

that they are really special and were
nice they were gospel oh yeah you know I
have like beautiful pictures on my wife

yes and something I definitely had to
step out of my comfort zone if I feel
like it I might do a video on my channel
if you guys are interested in it just
because I think that it's something that
a lot of women don't have the courage
and the confidence to do and it was hard
it definitely was hard finding it the
confidence to do it but I think it's
really special it's something really
great for your husband I think you have
to tell him it's a boudoir photo shoot
