way we're walking to the little dog hang
out here and we're going to get on the

beautiful beaches in the world so I

gonna be doing a really cool snorkeling
adventure there and then we're gonna

most beautiful beach I've ever seen they
sent me this sand and this water look at
this this is this is seriously insane
this is so cool
years and years ago the Kennedy family
came here to bake Lisa this is so
beautiful we're going to make this a
national monument so the islands only 1%
of the National Monument posted all the
rest is underwater yeah
I don't know if you guys can see but
there's this little white fish that's
actually swimming sideways and it has
two eyes on the side of its body ever

area we're gonna go in there and eat
some food getting off the boat hey how

behind all those trees you guys they set
up this cool little area to eat lunch
when I tell them about your experience I
had a lot of fun and we saw a lot of
cool fish the water felt amazing felt
really nice it was beautiful
honestly I was crying because it's okay
but um I got really sick
I don't know if it was from like
seasickness from the boat or my acid
reflux and like the salt but everywhere
in the school in the Caribbean Sea I
threw another stir this morning history
