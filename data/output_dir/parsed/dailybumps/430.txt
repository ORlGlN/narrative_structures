- Yes, Santa came.
- You're so cute, always.
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
-  Do you know for sure Santa came?
- Yes.
-  Did you hear him?
- Yes.
- I think we should definitely see
if the reindeer ate our carrots.
- Yeah.
- And we should see if
Santa ate our cookies.
- Yeah.
- And drink or milk.
Should we go look?
- Yeah.
("This Is Home" by Bryan Lanning)
- Good morning, guys.
It's very early.
Everyone's awake.
(Oliver speaking loudly)
Guess what?
Fin's still sleeping?
I love you.
- I love you too.
- Merry Christmas, buddy.
- Koda!
- Koda!
Hi, good morning, Koda.
- Let's check and see
if we see the reindeer.
The kids.
-  Oh, Ollie.
Let's check and see if they ate
that carrot out here.
-  Look.
- There's one more.
-  Whoa.
- It's just one more.
-  There was a lot
more carrots last night, huh?
- Yeah.
(midtempo jazz)
What's that?
(laughter)
-  "What's that"?
That means that Santa came.
-  See the car?
What did he bring you?
-  I don't know.
(Missy laughs)
- I don't even know if he knows how to
play the words.
What's going on right now?
- I don't know.
He's like what?
-  What do you
think about this, dude?
- Look at all of these.
-  Whoa.
Oh and look who's here.
Did you say good morning?
- Good morning, Meme and Papa.
- Good morning, merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, I'm so happy to see you.
- I want all these presents.
- I know.
- I wanna open my presents.
- So many.
-  Holy cow, you guys.
Santa came.
That's a nice car.
Santa knows how to pick them.
Look at this dune racer, Ollie.
Hope in it.
Here, I'll put Santa
as your sidekick there.
You could sit right there.
You know what, Ollie?
You remember that time
we were playing Pokemon
in the park and we found one of these?
- Yeah.
- I think this is the same exact one.
- It can go.
-  No, I don't
think it can go inside.
Look at this, Ollie.
- A red?
-  It's a wagon
for you and Fin.
- And there's a present in it.
-  And there's
a present in it, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Alright, we'll have to open it.
- It's a toy.
-  Yep, it is toy's huh?
Hey Ollie, we have to go
through all these presents
but guess what?
-  What?
- We probably should start the day
with some chocolate milk, huh?
- Yeah.
- You want some chocolate milk?
- I see something.
- Oh, you see other toys?
Whoa!
There's so many cool toys, huh?
- Look at the basketball?
-  Whoa, a basketball?
- That's actually for Fin.
- That's so cool.
Alright, Ollie, let's go
drink some chocolate milk.
Missy and I are very prepared.
We have premade this chocolate milk
so that we don't have to do it.
Here you go, buddy.
- Thank you.
-  You're welcome.
- Are you ready to open presents?
-  Yeah.
- Merry Christmas.
- It's a wagon and a present.
(laughter)
- That's for you.
-  Yeah.
- Can I have a kiss?
That's not a kiss.
Thank you.
-  What did you find, Ollie?
-  It's a bike and
it says to Ollie from Santa.
-  Whoa.
Whoa, Santa's got some fancy handwriting.
(soft jazz music)
- It's your turn.
- It's my turn?
-  It's your turn.
You have to do it now.
- Whoa.
(laughter)
(soft Christmas music)
-  Hey, Ollie, while
they're cooking breakfast,
let's put some socks on your feet.
Does daddy look like a Christmas tree?
-  Yeah.
-  It's pretty funny, huh?
- Oh my God!
-  What!
What happened in here?
- I don't know.
- What is all that?
-  Oh it's food.
- It's food and a sink and a stove.
-  Ollie, I think Santa gave you
your very own kitchen.
-  Yeah.
-  Wow.
-  Ice cream?
- Yeah.
- Can I have some ice cream?
-  Look at the pumpkin!
-  A pumpkin?
You love pumpkins!
-  Yeah.
-  Look what's in your fridge.
-  Whoa.
-  Milk?
-  Lots of different foods.
-  There's donuts and waffles.
- Donuts and waffles.
We need to eat those this morning.
We need to get our fuel
for opening presents.
-  You've got a little
table to eat your food.
-  I'm going to eat some chips.
-  Oh my goodness, what's that?
- What's this?
- I don't know.
- I think it's a cheeseburger.
- I don't need that.
-  No?
-  And it's chocolate milk.
- Yeah, look.
- That is crazy, Ollie.
So Santa got you your
very own kitchen to play
with you and Peg probably huh?
- Yeah.
- You're gonna love it.
Look, Ollie.
Ready?
-  Ah she's eating a cheeseburger.
-  Oh it's so yummy.
-  So you have a sink.
-  Yeah.
-  You can do your dishes.
-  And look at this.
You can even cut the bread.
-  Do you want some bread?
-  Hey, do you wanna
try and cut it, Ollie?
-  Hold on.
-  What do you see?
Oh you want to cut the watermelon?
-  Put it on the cutting board.
-  Here, sit it
on the cutting board.
And then you cut it.
- Okay.
-  The other way.
Yeah, there you go.
-  Whoa!
-  Okay!
There you go.
-  Wow, Ollie, that's so cool.
See under the sink, Ollie.
And look down here, you have storage.
And then you have your stove top.
You can cook some eggs.
-  Look, Ollie.
You can wear an apron and make us dinner.
Carrots!
-  Carrots.
That's cool.
And look, you can turn on the stove.
And the oven.
Whoa, what's in the oven, Ollie?
-  I don't know.
-  Looks like cupcakes and pizza.
-  Yeah.
-  Ooh, you should eat a cupcake.
-  Are those yummy cupcakes?
-  Yeah (unclear murmur).
-  Okay. (giggles)
-  Hey Ollie,
look at this cute little puppy dog apron.
- Whoa, cool.
-  Oh my gosh, that's adorable.
-  Now you can make the food
without getting your shirt dirty.
- Yeah.
-  So can I have some pancakes?
-  Yeah.
-  I think this
is pancakes in here.
And then you can put the syrup
and the strawberries on it.
I'll take syrup and
strawberries on a pancake.
(midtempo jazz)
- Santa just eat all his cookies.
-  He did?
- Yeah.
-  I didn't even check.
And he drank all his milk?
-  There's one more cookie.
-  Wow, he must not have been able
to eat them all, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Hey, Ollie, guess who's up?
- What?
-  Your brother.
- Fin?
-  Go get him.
- Okay.
(Oliver exclaiming wildly)
Merry Christmas.
Fin.
-  Merry Christmas, buddy.
Merry Christmas, Fin.
- He didn't cry.
-  No he's in such a good mood
because it's Christmas, huh?
Hey Fin, guess what?
Santa Claus came.
So excited.
And we have breakfast.
- Merry Christmas, Fin.
(baby talk)
(light jazz music)
There's a present.
-  Look at all those presents, Fin.
(crosstalk)
- Oh good morning.
-  I wanna open it.
-  I know, buddy.
We're gonna eat some
breakfast first, okay.
- I don't want to.
-  That's quite a stocking, Jim.
You fit your whole foot in that?
- Oh my God.
-  Buzz Lightyear PEZ?
- Yeah.
- Alright, before we open presents,
we always have to open
all of our stockings, huh?
You got a pterodactyl in your stocking?
- Yeah.
- You wanna see a trick?
- Yes.
- Perfectly balanced.
Whoa, you're perfectly balanced.
It's flying on your finger.
- Yeah.
(light jazz music)
-  Karma, what's that, what's that?
What's that?
Is that for you?
Open it.
Karma loves opening presents
and he opens them very meticulously.
Get it, Karma, get it.
Open it.
Get it.
Come on, rip it open.
-  Get it.
Get it, Karma.
-  Whoa, a big bone.
It's like, oh, just what I wanted.
Just what I get every year.
-  Wanted an iPad.
(laughter)
I see something.
-  Do you see something?
What is it?
It's a big truck.
A Tonka truck.
-  You can put all the dirt in it.
- Yeah.
-  That is so cool.
-  What did Fin get?
- It's a--
- I got one.
-  Whoa, cool.
I think he's reopening his stocking
and saying another one.
- Another minion?
- Yeah.
-  This is cute.
So Fin got this little
bike thing from Santa,
and it's the same one
that Jackson uses, huh?
Or Calvin.
- Yeah, Calvin.
-  That's so cool.
Whoa.
You got a truck too, Fin.
That's so cute.
Now they both have trucks.
Alright, the presents are passed out
and opening has now commenced.
Is that Beauty and the Beast?
-  I hope it is.
For that reaction.
(laughter)
(Missy cooing)
(Bryan sings theme from
Beauty and the Beast)
- I love Beauty and the Beast.
Wow.
- Well, apparently this is done by
a very famous indie artist.
His name is Jim Shore.
And Disney works with him.
And he's--
- So pretty.
-  That's so cool.
- I love it.
-  Cassie's
opening one from the boys.
What'd they get you?
- They got me...
What is it?
I can't--
-  Okay, if you
don't know what it is,
maybe you--
- I know what it is.
It's a Manfrotto.
(laughter)
-  It's a tripod.
- Where does it say tripod?
It's a tripod?
-  Yeah.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
(crosstalk)
- Oh, there goes Fin.
-  Is that a new game?
- Yeah.
-  A crocodile game?
-  Oh my God.
-  Oh my goodness, how cool.
You love crocodiles.
- Drop the Hook is not a board game.
(Jim awes)
-  I love how
it's exactly like mine.
No this is exactly.
-  Oh whoa.
- It's a leather apron
for when I'm working.
I get filthy.
- Yeah, I really like it.
-  It's really cool.
- I had a black one.
-  I bet you Jesus
wore something like that.
(whooping)
-  So you can make us spaghetti.
-  And it folds right up.
-  Whoa.
(crosstalk)
-  Come on, Fin.
Put it in.
Put it in, honey.
(Missy whoops)
(Bryan wees)
(Missy cheers)
-  Future Kobe Bryant right here.
Oh yeah.
Oh my God, he loves that.
Ollie, what did you get?
- Skateboard.
-  That's so cool, you like it?
- This is my skateboard.
-  That's so neat.
Jimmy just got Missy this.
Can you explain this.
They're cat ears and then
it reads your brainwaves
and then they go down or up
and they move around
based on your brainwaves.
- I am so excited.
(laughter)
-  You know her so well.
So there's lots of things
in different languages
that we don't know.
- We'll have to figure out
what each of these mean.
-  That is so funny.
- That is so cool.
Thank you, Jimmy.
-  What is is, Ollie?
- I don't know.
-  He's opening it.
-  You get one of those.
Oh my goodness.
-  Where'd you get that?

It could be lots of different things.

- How did you know that?
-  That is so neat.
- I wanna open it.
- Okay, we're gonna put it in the kitchen.
Alright, Bryan's opening one from me.
- Fancy.
-  Yeah.
Look at me.

Does Coach make men's things?
-  Yeah.
- There's so many wrappers and bags.
- It's a belt?
-  Yeah.
- That is so cool.
-  And it's the reversal kind too.
- It's reversible?
-  Yeah, like you can--
- Oh my gosh.
That is seriously so cool.
-  Isn't that cool?
- Thank you, babe.
- You're welcome.
He's a wears a belt every single day
and I thought I think I'm gonna

What do you think of that?
-  Mama, I open it.
- Um, we're caught up under the wagon,
we've got so many toys to open later.
-  Ollie, that is so cool.
-  It's a Pound Patrol.
You can play pretend all day long.
-  It has monkeys, Ollie.
(unclear speech)
- Sometimes, I don't even know.
- I don't know what's in there.
-  You don't know what's in there.
-  It's a Popsocket.
(crosstalk)
-  It's a flashlight.
Don't mess with Cassie.
- Go dad.
(crosstalk)
- Every year, dad will
get you something useful.
(laughter)
Useful.
-  Alright, Missy's
opening one from me.
- Really.
(Bryan laughs)
You got me a Spectacle?
I got you Spectacles.
(Missy exclaims)
Isn't that cool?
- You gotta turn up that Snapchat game.
- I know.
-  You love Snapchat
and you haven't been doing it in a while.
But I figured these might.
- That is so funny.
-  I wanna see the
world from your point of view.

a pretty blue box?
- What is it?
-  I saw him
scrounging around for pennies.
- They're always the best.
- So nervous.
Aw.
It's a little arrow.
-  Yeah it's sterling silver.
It's a cool little arrow pin necklace.
- Yeah, I love it.
Thanks, Ollie.
- Welcome.
And Fin.
Fin picked that one out too.
(laughter)
Fin's like, oh yeah, I was
browsing Tiffany forever.
No one would help him because
he was a baby, he was just walking around
that store for like an hour.
- I love it.
It's so pretty.
-  What is it, Ollie, what is it?
- I don't know.
It's tools.
-  Tools!
- It's a construction bench.
-  He's like, that's the one
I almost wrapped for Fin.
- I know, I thought it was Fin,
but it was Ollie.
-  So now you can be like papa
with all your tools, okay.
- Yeah.
-  Whoa, Fin.
- Wow.
(car sirens)
-  That's cool.
To Jimmy, from Missy and I.
What is it?
- I don't know.
-  He knows.
He knows.
- HTC Vive.
-  VR, baby.
- He's never gonna come
out of his room again.
- You know what?
That's the box he has left over from this?
-  Oh yeah, that's
actually in my bedroom right now.
Yeah.
This one is sick.
It's got room sensors.
- You put in the sensors in your room,
and you can walk around your room.
-  That's so cool, dude.
You're gonna be entering another world.
- A new little ring stand.
-  Yay.
- I really, really wanted one of these and
I'm so excited.
-  Cassie came through.
- It's so pretty.
It's much prettier than the Popsocket.
It's the same thing.
You put your finger in and
it stands your phone up
and it's really cool.
-  What is that, Ollie?
- I don't know what yet.
Whoa!
-  It's a Dinopet, Ollie.
So it's a big glass dinosaur
that goes in your room?
- Yeah.
-  And it glows different colors.
Really.
It's a living bioluminescent pet.
-  Alright.
I got you something really cool.
- Really cool, huh?
-  Just for you.
- Is it really cool and manly?
-  Yeah.
(giggles)
- It's new tools.
-  He's been asking
for an organized tool box
with all the tools that we need
for household stuff.
-  This is a good size too.
-  Yeah it's kinda perfect.
It has everything.
-  Is that the ratchet drill?
-  Yeah.
- Yeah, that's the nice
drill that your dad has.
Okay, I know I don't do a lot but
around the house it's nice--
- But you know, we're
always looking for something
and our stuff's always everywhere.
Oh, maybe in that cabinet or that drawer
or over there--
- Do you need a screwdriver?
'Cause I've got a bunch.
-  (giggling) I know.
That was dad's idea.
He's always like, oh trust me,
he needs all of these.
- Well, it's annoying when you need
a hammer, but you can't find a hammer
and then you look for two hours
and it's in the top of
the closet somewhere.
-  Yeah.
Yep, yep.
- Now I have a place for it.
-  And then go ahead and open that
bag over there.
- The bag?
-  Yeah.
- A blanket.
-  So this will stay
on top of your tool set.
And it's a very organized.
-  Oh it's so heavy.
-  With all the things you need.
- All things I need to put together,
toys and furniture.
Oh, that's just really heavy.
-  Okay, go put it on top of that.
Dad, what'd you get?
-  I don't know.
-  Oh yeah.
(giggling)
- Oh yeah.
When I put the cars together,
I just stare at this the whole time.
-  (giggles) Yeah I know.
I don't know what that is but
apparently I think it--
- You know how I round
the edges of everything?
-  Yeah.
- Is that for your
router for your Internet?
- Rounded edge?
-  Yeah, yeah.
- It mounts in here.
-  Oh.
- That would mount inside my table.
- Does it make the wi-fi faster?
-  What's that password?
- It's a router table.
I was literally like, I
have no idea what this is.
I hope he likes it.
(giggles)
- When I round the edges of stuff,
this is the thing you use.
-  Yep, there you go.
Well, I'm glad you like it.
(light Christmas music)
(playful music)
-  Ollie is currently
looking for his chocolate milk
in this mess.
(playful music)
Okay, these things are
interesting for sure.
- Jimmy says that I'm focused and relaxed.
-  Oh wow.
- He was like, seriously, it's true.
- Are you drunk on Christmas?
- Yeah.
(door bell rings)
- I think I hear someone at the door.
Do you hear someone at the door?
- Yeah.
-  Fin, do you
hear someone at the door?
Who could be here?
(unclear murmur)
Do you want to get the door?
Go get the door.
Open it.
-  Ho, ho, ho.
Almost forgot one.
-  Santa?
What is that?
-  What is that?
What is that?
Is that Santa?
-  Santa's leaving?
- Say bye, Santa.
-  Bye, Santa.
-  Did Santa just drop off a puppy?
- Oh my gosh.
Look at his face.
(giggles)
What is that?
- It's a puppy.
(giggles)
- Did Santa just drop off
a brand new responsibility?
-  Y'all got a puppy?
-  Fin, it's a new puppy.
Hey.
-  Oh she likes you.
-  Hi, new puppy.
-  She likes you too.
-  Take this floppy thing off.
-  So what did Santa say
when he sat her down?
(Oliver mumbles)
He said he forgot something?
- Yeah, he bring it.
-  Hey, you.
It's a girl, Ollie.
Yeah.
We got a little puppy for Christmas, babe?
- Oh I love her so much.
-  Aw.
- I love the puppy breath.
- Maybe there's another one out there.
- I need to get this in there.
- You think we can bring that in?
Is that her bed?
-  She's so cute.
Ollie, you see her eyes are blue.
(Ollie exclaims unintelligibly)
- What'd you get?
-  A puppy.
- Wow.
- Santa brought it?
Oh hello, puppy.
-  Come sit down
so she can play with you.
She's gotta smell you and get to know you.
- No, puppy.
-  We'll move your
gun so that she doesn't--
- Oh it just hit me.
(laughter)
-  Oh Fin's in love.
-  Ollie.
-  She's so cute.
- I wish Tina was here.
-  Do we really keep her.
- Of course, we're keeping her.
- Is that her bed?
She got a little basket.
That's where she can sleep, huh?
-  Ollie, what should we name her?
- I don't know.
-  She's so cute.
So what kind of dog is she?
- She's definitely an Australian shepherd.
She used to lie like Karma.
She looks like Karma.
-  She's so small.
She's just a little puppy.
Ollie, you wanna play with her?
- Yeah.
-  Play with her.
- Go run, go run, go.
-  Doggie, you
wanna see my bedroom?
-  Oh let's go
show her your bedroom.
Go, go, go, go.
Show her your bedroom.
Look, she likes it.
- Look, puppy.
-  Come here, puppy.
(Fin crying out)
-  She's giving him kisses.
-  Come here.
- Oh my gosh.
She's so cute.
This is crazy.
I mean I always know we talked
about getting a second dog.
- Yeah, we have a lot of land,
and we've really been
wanting to fill it with dogs.
-  Ollie, what
do you think about that?
-  Isn't she cute.
-  Yeah.
-  Say come on puppy.
-  Let's go play
outside with her, Ollie.
- Okay.
-  Come on, come on, Fin.
Ah she's getting you.
Let's go outside, puppy.
(Ollie exclaims)
(uptempo pop music)
Ollie, your puppy is so cute.
- Yeah.
-  Look at her.
Oh she's peeing.
Good girl.
(giggling)
Come here, hi puppy.
Hi, puppy.
You want a belly scratch.
You want a belly scratch.
You want a belly scratch.
You're so fluffy.
You're so fluffy, puppy.
Go get him.
She's got you, Fin.
She's got you, Fin.
We don't have a name yet do we?
What do you wanna name her, babe?
- That's the truck Luna.
I thought Lunatic.
-  Lunatic?
- I love the name Luna.
- Luna's a cute name.
Come here, puppy.
She's so cute.
-  Oh you love her.
This is our little Luna?
-  Should we name her Luna?
- Yeah.
- If we call her Luna, we
can call her Lu-Lu or Lu.
-  Hi, Lu.
Do you want to be Lu?
-  I'd stick with Lunatic.
(laughing)
We're gonna have so much fun!
Look at this, Luna.
Everything the light touches is yours.
-  And Karma's.
- That's right, Karma.
You're gonna have to get the sheep.
-  Yeah, she's a sheep dog.
(uptempo pop music)
-  Pop, I think you missed it,
but Santa showed up.
- What?
-  Yeah.
He just showed up and
dropped this thing off.
- And I walk out and everybody's
screaming about Santa.
I go what did I miss.
-  Yeah.
Santa showed up.
I bet we can catch him
on the security footage.
Babe, because we have
a camera right there.
We could see Santa.
Leo.
Karma, Karma.
Merry Christmas, we
have a new family member
and you guys are gonna get along so great.
I already know it because
you've got lots of
Australian shepherd in you, huh?
See the puppy?
Aw.
(unclear background speech)
So this is Luna.
- Luna.
Do we like Luna?
Should we call her Lu-Lu?
- Yeah.
- Can you say Lu-Lu?
(uptempo pop music)
Look how she lays.
It looks so cute.
-  She literally
just falls out on the grass
with all her legs.
Oh thank you, Ollie, for
bringing her breakfast.
(uptempo pop music)
This is what she showed up in
and oh, look at that.
My First Christmas.
That's her stocking.
And look, she's got a pillow.
Go give her her pillow.
And look at this cute little outfit.
-  Aw.
-  That's cute.
Let's see what's in her stocking.
Maybe she has something
she can chew on, huh?
Because she's a puppy.
- Look it's some food.
-  Some treats.
Ollie, look at this.
This is a really nice chew toy for her.
Looks like there are some cute bows.
Go give those to mama.
Some more cute bows
since she's our little princess now.
And a chew toy.
Do you want to chew on this?
You can chew on this, okay?
I have a feeling we're
gonna lose a lot of shoes.
-  Shoes.
They'll be some tears.
- Ooh, what are you showing there?
-  A dinosaur egg.
- Oh that's so cool.
Did you get that for Christmas?
- Yeah.
- From who?
- From Meme and Papa.
-  That's fancy.
- Yeah.
- Do you like dino eggs too, Luna?
-  She loves them.
(unintelligible speech )
-  Oh she likes longnecks?
- Yeah.
-  Oh that's cool.
- Oh look at you.
You got a little jacket on.
She's got a little jacket on.
You see Cody.
She's like, I do not like that.
Oh, what you got for her?
- A candy cane.
-  Oh that looks fun.
- And I got a bone.
- Oh what's this do?
(toy squeaks)
-  She is not interested.
- And look what I got.
- A cookie.
-  And we got another cookie.
- Another cookie.
-  Karma, can you share
because I think those are yours?
Are you willing to share with the new pup?
-  Karma's like excuse me,
these actually are mine.
Not sharing right now.
-  Alright, we
are bonding with Luna
on the trampoline.
She's already got her candy cane, Ollie.
- This is my new trampoline.
-  I know, it's so cool, huh?
- (unclear speech) And
I got a big trampoline.
No, no.
-  No, no.
She's okay.
She's got a candy cane, buddy.
-  Whoa.
She's fine.
Grab her bone.
(Fin screams)
-  She's so cute and fluffy.
Hi, hi Luna.
Hi, Luna.
Luna, you want your candy cane?
-  There you go.
Good girl.
-  I ate candy canes.
(Bryan coos)
-  You want the ball?
Go get it.
You want the candy cane?
(Bryan growls playfully)
(laughter)
Don't chew on me, huh?
- She's crying.
- She just likes to whine.
She's a whiner.
I bet she just wants to kiss you.
-  Climb in the dune racer.
- Fin wants to ride so you just...
Can she ride with you.
- M hm.
-  Okay push the pedal.
-  Push the pedal, go.
-  You gotta steer though.
Oh.
I think we're gonna need to get
Ollie some driving lessons.
Right, Ollie.
-  Yeah.
- Yeah, you gotta drive with both hands.
He's like, I can do it.
What's that?
Oh, a big ol' fox.
(toy squeaks)
Hi, Koda.
Hi, Karma.
Yeah, all the dogs going to play.
What do you think of Luna, Fin?
Think she's pretty cool?
Fin had a very good Christmas.
Let me tell you.
Everyone had,
we had such a good
Christmas morning, you guys.
(Fin exclaiming)
Yeah.
Now it's time to just
play with all our fun toys
and enjoy family and bond
with our new family member.
We have a new family member now.
Fin, that's our new family member.
(Fin exclaims)
Yeah.
(car revs)
Oh, careful.
I gotta say, out of all this
amazing delicious Christmas candy we got,
I still love Crabbie Patties.
Gummy Crabbie Patties.
And look at this one.
It's a monster-sized one.
What are we doing over here?
We got a game?
So Fin's favorite thing to do
is take things and put things into stuff.
- Which is why he likes
the basketball net.
- It's like you put the ball in,
and then it shoots it out,
so he'll go get it and put it in.
-  Oh that's awesome.
We'll have a baby game of fetch.
- Yep, pretty much.
-  What are you eating?
- This.
-  Oh put it in your mouth.
It'll give you a funny nose.
And then leave it.
Move your hand.
Look it, you're like a reindeer.
You want a piece of gummy?
Yeah you can have the lettuce.
And Luna's honestly just
entertaining herself outside.
It's the cutest thing.
She's playing with that little fox thing.
Oh hi, Koda.
She didn't like that one shirt we got
but I think she might
like this one because
it's super thin.
We happened to order a small dog one
that matches all of our pajamas.
So let's go see if she likes it.
Alright, Luna.
Let's put this shirt on you.
Let's see what you think.
Aw, look at that.
Oh that's your back leg.
(murmuring)
Spoiler alert, she looks adorable.
Look at her little shirt.
And it's got the same little reindeer
on the back like the doggies do.
And it makes her look fluffier.
She's so fluffy.
Okay, wanna run around?
Can she walk in it?
(giggles) She's good.
Oh she hates it.
(laughing)
Yeah, I have a feeling she
doesn't like being dressed.
You see I like to dress our puppies.
Karma was wearing a Christmas mock sweater
for most of the season, huh?
What do you think?
Oh she's getting used to it.
Look at all these doggies matching.
That's so cute.
Alright we got this thing all set up.
Look at them bouncing around there, Finny.
Four?
What do the number do?
Oh look at them go, look at them go.
Okay, put it back in.
Fin's like, just stay in there.
(uptempo playful music)
Okay, I'm wearing the ears, you guys.
And I think I am focused or relaxing
on something right now.
At least that's what it tells me.
Everyone's kind of napping right now,
because we had a crazy Christmas morning.
And I think Missy's
sleeping with the puppy.
I look like a fool.
(soft piano jazz)
Okay, these are officially
the weirdest thing ever.
Yeah, that's super cute.
Missy's sleeping with the puppy right now.
(soft piano music)
Luna.
Oh, she's going pee pee.
Good girl.
Good girl.
You went to pee outside.
Throw the ball for the doggies, Ollie.
(unintelligible speech)
Okay.
Luna's like, I'm just waiting
to see what happens next.
Hi, baby girl.
Time to go.
Alright.
Everyone is awake from the naps.
Starting to get ready for the day
although it's like one or two o'clock.
We were up until 3:30.
We were waiting for Santa.
We weren't setting anything up
or putting presents under because
that's what Santa does.
But we were waiting for him.
We fell asleep at like
3:30 waiting for him.
So we never found him.
So we were up late.
- I like my new puppy dog.
-  She's cute, huh?
- Yeah.
-  You having lots of fun with her.
- Where's my puppy dog?
- She's right there.
-  She's right there?
-  Go get her.
- Okay.
-  Say hi, Luna.
-  Hi, Luna.
She likes me.
Do not bite me.
-  Don't let her bite you, okay?
Luna, look what I have.
Look what I have, look what I have.
Look what I have, look what I have.
Go get it!
(soft Christmas music)
- Look at my Toy Story shoes.
- Ah, one thing we got the
boys was Toy Story Vans.
And we got all three
styles for both of them.
And I'm so excited.
We didn't even wrap them
because I mean, they're shoes.
Let's be honest.
So we wanted some shoes that
he could slip into easily.
Is it these ones?
Oh yeah, I think it's these ones, look!
- I like these.
(baby murmurs)
-  And then look
on the bottom, Ollie.
It says Andy.
- Andy.
-  Yeah.
(unclear remark from Missy)
That's so freaking cute.
Okay, let's put these shoes on, okay?
Do you like 'em?
-  Yes.
- Guess what, Ollie?
-  What?
-  They glow in the dark.
- They glow in the dark?
-  Yeah.
Pretty cool, huh?
- Let me just go outside.
-  Okay.
Aw, boy!
Do you see his shoes?
- Oh my God, they're cute.
-  They're Buzz Lightyear slip-ons
and look at it.
- Oh, Andy.
(Bryan giggles)
-  It's awesome.
What do you think about those fin?
Fin's got a matching pair.
Let's put them on.
They also say Andy on them.
- He likes me.
-  Ollie, look
at your brother's shoes.
- Whoa.
-  They match yours.
- Buzz Lightyear.
-  Yeah, isn't that cool?
(soft guitar music)
Alright, we are teaching
Luna all about our backyard.
Right, Ollie?
- Yeah.
-  We've got to show her all around
so that she knows where everything is.
So Luna, these are our rocks.
Be careful though.
You've got to be careful.
-  Luna, where are you going?
- She is exploring already.
Where is she?
Oh she already went to the other side.
And she's gone (giggles).
(soft guitar music)
What did you do, Ollie?
You opened your dinosaur egg already?
- Yeah.
-  What you got?
- I don't know.
-  Oh I think I know what it is.
I think it's a stegosaurus.
- Okay.
-  What do you think it is?
- I don't know.
Look it.
-  What is it?
- I don't know.
Let me show you.
It's a (murmuring).
(soft guitar music)
(Missy imitates the
Lion King theme lyrics)
-  Alright, Luna,
go meet the chickens.
-  Come here.
-  Oh (giggles).
- Marie, you like doggies.
Where you been.
-  Well, Luna
doesn't have a problem
with the chickens,
but the chickens have a problem with her.
Really.
Don't worry, Luna.
In time, the chickens will love you.
- They love, don't worry.
They love Karma.
They know Karma helps protect them.
(Ollie speaking unintelligibly)
-  Oh yeah.
Prime rib.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
- It looks delicious.
-  We are sitting
down ready for dinner.
We are eating at this big table.
Second time we've eaten at this table.
Yeah we ate at this
table for Christmas eve,
and now we have it all
setup for Christmas.
(Ollie exclaims)
Yeah, Ollie.
You're even eating on the fancy plates.
You got your mac and
cheese and your banana.
What's that?
- A napkin.
-  You got your napkin, huh?
(Ollie speaks unintelligibly)
-  It's got a little napkin holder.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Alright you guys, Fin has gone to bed
and we are now putting Ollie to bed
and putting our amazing
Christmas day to rest.
Luna's just watching us,
like, oh, this is where Ollie sleeps?
(giggling)
She's been such a good puppy, you guys.
Her and Ollie kinda got
off to a rough start.
She was a little more rough, I think,
than Ollie was anticipating.
But I think, once Ollie got like,
energy and confidence,
he was having so much
fun with her.
- I think when she
realized that she really...
It is hard when she's a puppy.
She has sharp teeth.
But when she realized he wasn't...
She's not being mean or anything.
Then, he was like okay.
I mean they ran around the
yard all day, those two.
- Yeah, we've honestly
just been playing with her.
She hasn't had an accident
once in the house.
We've been taking her out
every two hours, I think,
to potty.
And anytime after she wakes up.
We're also giving her
lots of toys to chew on.
We're not letting play
with our hands as toys.
She's been so cuddly and just playful,
all day, honestly.
I don't think we could ask
for a much better puppy.
- If she stays like this.
-  I know (giggles).
No, it's not going to be easy.
Puppies are not easy.
But it's going to be fun.
- The puppy breath is
strong with this one.
(laughter)
-  Alright, Ollie.
Let's hope in bed buddy.
- Okay.
I like my new puppy.
-  Do you?
-  Yeah.
- Look at her.
-  Well climb in the bed.
She'll cuddle with you.
-  She can sleep with you.
-  Yeah once
she's all toilet trained,
or potty trained.
That would be cool if she used the toilet.
-  Don't get her riled up.
-  Say night, night puppy.
Can you give her a hug.
- Yeah.
-  Give her a hug, Ollie.
(cooing)
Say, night night, puppy.
-  Just be calm.
Because it's night time.
(Bryan giggles)
- Goodnight, night, puppy.
Well, you guys, I hope you really enjoyed
the Daily Bumps 2016 Christmas special.
We had a blast
and I hope you guys had an
amazing Christmas as well.

Home" by Bryan Lanning)
