hey guys good morning we are actually
off to all of his very first private
swim lessons son baby boy's gonna do
amazing things I am actually pretty
nervous about it I and I'm gonna be
honest I'm I don't even know if I'm
going to stick with the private lessons
because I really liked the guppy class I
was like I'm more like on Mommy and Me
class more than just like swimming but
it was obviously also learning to swim
and you know being safe in the water and
definitely willing to try out the
private lessons I'm sure it's still
going to be a ton of fun but I just
really liked that Mommy and Me type of
class if I can just see him like
learning and loving it then I'm sure
I'll stick with it but I just love the
mommy me cause I'm going to miss like
all the little babies and Kim getting to
kind of socialize in a way we can find a
new hobby put them in with lots of
babies yeah like another mommy and me
pot type of us
taken SP you can SP you
he loves the gup-e hey buddy watch his
arm just doing the baby butterfly
he did so good buddy rinsing off is a
little bit more difficult when you're
not amazing so huh I just got all it
down for his nap he was exhausted um
actually he slept in this morning so he
was like just ready for his nap when we
got in to swim class so of course after
some class he was just like done but you
know why I really enjoyed the class I
feel like he learned a ton I feel like
he wasn't so focused on like me and he
was more focused on like learning and so
I I think I'm gonna stick with the class
me and he always go swimming all the
time so there's other times that I can
do that with him and this is more for
him to learn to be safe in the water and
if I really want that to me through then
I'm gonna have to let him actually learn
all right guys it is Badri today so I
just ran into free birds while Missy is
putting ollie down for a nap
he does it every day I feel like he was
already doing better floating on his
back because he's just very Wiggly and I
feel like he was starting to like figure
out you know how to do that and so no I
think I'm gonna stick with it as long as
he enjoyed it which he was smilin and he
loved it and he had so much fun I'm
excited though I feel like he's gonna
really start to learn stuff and that's
that's really cool you know she said to
me
forget what you thought cause good girls
in vacuums and happy be good it's a good
sauce I think the thing good girls are
bad girls have it be God hey Cassie what
