bunch of things and now our closet is
probably the biggest project of all and
we're actually almost done I forgot mine

everything organized throwing away old
stuff that you just you know shove to
the back of the yeah you don't wear
anymore so we're just kind of going
through I'm gonna donate some clothes
get rid of trash that has just been
hanging out in here I mean this corner
for me has just been a pile of just crap
for like months
so I finally was able to organize all my
clothes and just clean up a lot feels
really good and that's very much what
we're doing today we're just gonna move
from room to room I don't know how much
we'll get done today but it'd be nice if
we could get a good dent in and then
every day just kind of do one room at a
time or something Finn has actually been
super nice to us he is slept for like
ever he's took a really really good nap
but it looks like he did just wake up
once there's a baby not a lot gets done
after that right yeah like we're like
fighting the time to keep them busy I

hats to try and clear up some space I
actually think I'm going to end up
needing to add a couple more drawers and
they designed our closet in a way where
we can actually turn these into drawers
and move some of the top words so I look
like I have like three or four clear
spaces that I could actually do this but
I have realized that I have maybe an
obsession with black boots because I
have lots of different versions but I
actually got rid of a lot of shoes I did
get rid of my superstars because they
were so beat up so maybe I'll get a new
pair of those as well and I'm going
