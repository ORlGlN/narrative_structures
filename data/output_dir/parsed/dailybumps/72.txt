- Good morning, did
you guys take a shower?
Haven't brushed your head yet, huh?
Good morning guys, we
are all ready for the day
but we're a little bumped because
we haven't seen Fred yet, huh?
Where's Fred?
We've been looking everywhere
for him, we can't find him.
He must just be still
busy with Santa Claus,
I'm sure he'll be here later, okay?
No one get too worried.
Also, it is actually
16 days till Christmas,
so, let's just change that real quick.
Oh my gosh, it's official,
16 days till Christmas!
Ah!
Oh, and 16 days till Christmas.
There, now we're ready for 16
days till Christmas, right?
- Hello guys!
And hello Karma, you hanging
out in the truck with us?
He is so funny, he's got his leg,
his back leg's up on the seat
and his front leg's in front of them
and he's like so happy now.
Karma's going to a little
check up with the vet.
- Yeah, we're hoping like, he's just been
gaining a lot of weight and
he's not normally like this.
I hope he's okay.
Maybe he needs to go on a diet,
maybe he needs a little more exercise.
- Yeah, I mean it happens to us all
around Christmas time right?
It's like...
- Well, keep in mind, he is
gonna be eight this year.
- Eight, wow!
- Eight years old, like that's
so old and it scares me.
- Yeah so, we're taking him in,
we're gonna see if he's doing okay.
He wants to be a kitty,
wants to sit in the...
The actual car seat.
Put that one that way.
Perfect, just like that.
You wanna try, Finn?
- It's almost tall.
- Oh no, almost.
That should be like that
though, isn't that cool?
The kids are doing some tower
building with these blocks
that we left out there.
Oh, almost Finn!
I got it, oh...
It's okay.
I'll fix it.
It's okay, accidents happen.
Alright, keep going, Ollie.
How high can we make it?
- I don't know!
- Now it's got a little star on it.
- Ya.
- Other way, turn it.
Almost, you gotta go like
this and then like this,
and then like this.
Whoa, that's a cool looking tower, dude!
Yeah, so Fred has still
not shown up today,
we're thinking maybe he had to
run a couple errands before or...
He's running late.
Yeah, apparently.
- Oh no...
-  Finn's so excited,
can you put in on right, Ollie?
There you go, that's a cool tower, huh?
- Guys, if you build this now,
and...
Okay, game over.
- You guys broke the tower.
Look who's here, it's CJ and Bailey!
Hey Ollie, guess what?
- What?
-  CJ and Bailey are
gonna stay the night tonight
and hang out, isn't that cool?
(festive music)
(screaming)
What?
-  What do you see?
-  What did Finn just find?
Finn just found something, you guys.
- The elf!
-  Ollie, look!
Look what he found!
Fred!
- Look, he said, sorry I'm late.
Aw, he feels bad...
-  And he said, let's bake today!
You guys wanna do some baking with Fred?
-  Yeah!
-  Yeah!
Hi Fred!
We missed you, dude.
What is he baking by the way?
Just a bowl of sprinkles, it looks like.
Isn't that cool?
-  I think he feels
really bad that he's late.
-  Don't eat that,
that's just flour, dude.
Hey Ollie, what do you
think Fred wants to bake?
- Cookies!
-  Bacon?
- Bacon?
-  Cookies?
Cookies sound good.
- Cookies for Santa.
-  We should do
cookie for Santa, Ollie.
- Oh yeah!
- We can have cookies for ourselves too.
-  That's true, like we can
just pretend or practice, right?
- Yeah.
-  I know, look, he's even got
little eggs and a little whisk.
(festive music)
Alright, next up, we need brown sugar.
Who's putting that one in?
Finn?
You wanna put it in?
- Yeah!
-  Put that in, okay.
-  Brown sugar's the best, huh?
- I've never tried brown sugar.
- You wanna try it?
-  There you go, Finn.
Dump it in, dude.
Yeah...
(festive music)
Alright, CJ's gonna mix it all up,
you know how to do this, man?
CJ's a little older, but he'll
need a little help though.
- Okay, we got that and
now you just go like that.
-  Perfect.
Mix it up, all your
butter with your sugar.
It's the first thing you gotta do
when you're making cookies.
-  And now we gotta take pictures,
everybody look here and smile, say cheese!
-  Smile!
- Cheese!
(festive music)
-  Alright Bailey's adding vanilla!
-  Add all of it.
You can add all of it.
-  Yep!
-  We don't have much left.
-  The last drop of vanilla.
Fred really should have picked us
up some vanilla from the store.
- Fred, next time you're out.
-  Fred, we're out of vanilla.
- Now we need the eggs,
we'll let CJ do the eggs.
Just one egg at a time, so go ahead and
-  We're putting all your
skills to the test today man.
- Here, try the, maybe here.
-  There you go, flat surface
on the counter, there you go.
- Got it.
-  Good job dude!
Good job, dude!
-  Now let CJ,
you want to mix it, CJ?
(festive music)
- CJ, I have to say, I am very
impressed with your baking skills man!
You're pretty good around
the kitchen you know.
- No, I'm not.
- No?
What kind of food can
you make on your own?
- I can only heat up stuff.
- You're good at heating up stuff?
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's good
-  You're next, Finn.
Okay Ollie, go ahead and add it.
- Oh my gosh!
-  Alright, Finn is adding salt.
Gotta have good salt in your cookies.
Alright, we're adding flour now.
Things might get a little messy,
so we put on some aprons, show me yours.
Ooh, it's like Mrs. Claus,
that's cool, Bailey!
And Ollie, you've got puppy dogs!
-  I just start it really slow
cause we don't want it to
like, poof up everywhere.
- Poof, poof!
- Here, eat this!
- No!
- Eat this!
- They're so cute.
They're having so much fun baking.
(lively music)
How is it?
- I wanna try it!
- I want a big piece!
I want a big piece!
- Is it really good?
You want a little piece too?
- I want a big piece.
- Okay.
- Yum.
Best part about the holidays is baking
and you can't bake
without chocolate chips,
so it's time to add the chocolate chips!
Alright, dump them in.
Chocolate!
- It's like my favorite.
- It smells so good.
(upbeat festive music)
Cookies are coming out of the
oven and they look so good.
You guys all did such a
good job baking cookies
and now we're eating pizza!
- It was fun!
-  It was fun, huh?
- I loved tasting it.
-  Yum!
So you guys have an elf on
the shelf too right, CJ?
So what's your guys' elf's name?
- Super Zippy.
-  Super Zippy?
That's cool.
- But his real name,
not full, is just Zippy.
-  Oh, okay.
Got ya.
- We usually call him Zippy
because that's shorter.
So does your elf do cool things too?
- Yeah.
- What does your elf do?
- Well today he was sitting
on the fireplace mantle
and he ran a note saying,
I hid 10 candy canes.
-  Oh, so you guys had
to search for candy canes.
That's so cool.
- We found 10, so CJ found
five and I found five.
- I know, those Elf on the Shelves
are always hiding things, huh Ollie?
Remember when he hid those
candy canes from you guys?
- How many?
-  I think he hid six.
- Santa's gonna come and get us sledding!
-  If you guys are
good, your elf on the shelf
is watching, Ollie, so you better be good
because he is taking
notes throughout the day
and he is headed home
tonight to tell Santa
how you've been, okay?
So you gotta be a good boy
if you want presents right?
Okay.
Good boys also eat their pizza.
- Alright, kids have finished their dinner
and it's now time for cookies!
Hey guys, we're missing
someone someone, where's CJ?
- Yeah.
- He's in a room.
- Oh, CJ, do you want cookies?
Oh, and there they go.
Finn, you just stay here like a
good boy and eat your cookie, okay?
- Okay.
- You guys, it is now cookie time
and I gotta say guys, we are
doing great on our schedule,
I was like, we're gonna have dinner
and we'll eat cookies and
then we'll watch a movie
and then we'll go to bed!
And we're right on time so I'm so excited.
Everything is going smoothly and the kids
are having a blast together
and definitely playing a ton
which means, we're gonna
be tired at bedtime.
-  D-O-L-L.
- How do you...
- It's the O first and then the board.
That's how you do it.
- Bailey is working on
her letter to Santa Claus.
I know, she just went
straight into the list,
she's like, I want a Belle Doll.
- Good job, good job, we can
keep writing what you want.
- Bailey really wants a
Belle Doll for Christmas,
CJ, what about you?
Hey, look at me, you want
a napkin for Christmas?
Just kidding.
What does DJ want for Christmas?
- I want Call of Duty World War Two.
- Oh, dude!
I want that game too
actually, it looks so good.
Dear Santa, I have been
very good this year.
Alright, you better prove it,
make sure your penmanship
is good for Santa.
You doing okay over here?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
Okay.
(upbeat festive music)
Alright CJ, pop your letter
in the special mail box.
That's special delivery, so it's sending
straight to the North Pole, okay?
(upbeat festive music)
(upbeat outro music)
