get the flight get the fly oh my god
they killed the fluffy would my how's it
going babe baby's been moving and
grooving like crazy been able to grab
the camera fast no he was seriously like
well first of all he was super bulged
out go check out my C's Instagram if you
didn't see the picture but he was doing
that again today and then he was like
rolling and moving and actually that
might have been what happened because
you just got back from the chiropractor
and what did they say and he's now in
the correct position meaning it he's
always been head down but he was
posterior where like his head would come
out and could get like squished in
smushed and now he's in the right
position I seriously think he doesn't
move it this morning
cuz he was moving like crazy I have no
idea in he knows it's also like he can
move again I went to the chiropractor
he's having like colonizer so that and
he's like yep you have a beer pulley
muscles being pulled and you need your
back adjusted so he did like a ton of
adjusting on my back I last there and I
was like oh it seems like the like the
really intense pain can't is off but
it's like totally back Oh Dan you go get
in the pool pregnancy is just rough you
guys but you know what I honestly don't
think that she's going to be feeling
this for much longer my guess is that
Finlay is going to be here before the
end of the month so you're gonna be 38
weeks at the end of the month right I
believe so yeah so I seriously think
you're gonna happy having him either
now until 38 weeks hopefully it's a
little bit later into the month but
that's just my guess by the end of this
month we're gonna have Finley yeah I
hope he's not hoping that any times he's
just guessing
oh that's weird yeah made of foam so you
made slime um it's not really slime but
hard it's like it all I don't put stuff
in it so it's just like I got it off of
