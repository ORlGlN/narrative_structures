Oh 254 than having the hardest time
going to sleep so quiet out yeah so it's
been rough night but having trouble
sleeping lately there's they cannot
believe it's almost 3:00 in the morning
so I decided to get up and blog about
everyone is obviously sleeping and the
house is very still and quiet and a
little creepy
actually heard from some other youtubers
about this challenge going around it's
called a 3 a.m. challenge I don't know
if you guys I've heard about this but
apparently at 3 a.m.
weird things happen if you do something
very specific if you spin on digit
digits sorry I can't ring it so so early
I mean it's almost 3:00 and we might as
well try it right what is it to 258 I
could probably find 10 video spinners
since I'm up so early in the morning I'm
going to do the 3 a.m. challenge and I'm
going to spin 10 digit spinners at 3
a.m. and see if something spooky happens
sometimes you get like a scary phone
call something crazy scary happens I
doubt it's going to happen I just want
to put all these 3 a.m. challenge rumors
to rest and test this out but I got to
find 10 fidget spinners lying around the
house flashlight that will come in handy
