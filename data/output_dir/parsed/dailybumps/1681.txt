much slept like three hours last night
and Missy hasn't even slept yet or Egan
told her she's gonna have to eat this
nasty hospital food eventually this
first checkup
sounds great he's got a little bit of
what we call a murmur an extra heart
sound that's totally normal at his age a
lot of babies we call it a transitional
murmur so it's not like a murmur that
it's a murmur that'll go away
they might even go away before he leaves
the hospital he just has an extra little
heart sound
which is totally normal are there any
issues with the c-section didn't sound
like it well aside from he needed a
little help breathing but besides that I
use testing like reflexes yes it's kind
of part of the neurological exam we
checked out like a feat that you saw me
do and then they can show that he grasps
and you put your thumbs in here we're
gonna fingers be like grasps on and then
we lift them up and put them down that's
normal it upsets them but it's normal
yeah I always have to warn the parents
for little bit how long till the
umbilical cord cause I um I tell it well
it's dude it's getting pretty dry
snowcats often the next day or two or
before you leave okay and then it'll
take I don't know about a week to
completely dry up and fall off at the
most sometimes they get pretty dry even
here yeah but it'll look it looked like
it looks like it's getting really dry
