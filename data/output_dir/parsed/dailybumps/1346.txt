hey guys and welcome to the busiest week
of our life this is us Sunday me
they're all gonna do amazing things I
always see that but it literally always
feels that way I don't know why it has
been a pretty crazy week already it's
actually not morning it's afternoon
because we've been filming an episode of
a baby League all morning which we still
have stuff to do for I'm running to go
do errands we have to get another video
for Missy's channel film and then I have
like a ton of paperwork that I need to
catch up on and then tomorrow we're
actually going to raking waters and then
the next day is VidCon so it's like this
crazy week of just like one thing after
another but I'm gonna try and relax when
we get to VidCon because we actually
don't have a whole lot going on this
year we put on our own Meetup I kind of
like drop the ball I'm like setting
anything up that we would do at VidCon
but it's actually pretty nice because we
are pretty much free we're gonna be
going to a couple of VIP parties which
is fun and hanging out by the pool with
our good friends Katie and : who are
coming from Alabama so that should be
fun I'm actually really really looking
forward to seeing them and just getting
to chill with them you know so that's
what's up
crazy crazy day today we're getting
stuff done though hey guys so get this I
really don't know how I got so lucky but
um I have always nursed Ollie to sleep
basically I've never really um done the
whole just put him in the bed without
with like without nursing and so it's
always kind of been like that problem
where obviously if he needs to go to
sleep I'm gonna need a nurse him lately
we've been kind of getting like a little
bit worried like maybe he's going to be
too dependent on it but it's so crazy
because lately he nurses before bed but
he doesn't go to sleep I lay him in this
crib and then he just lays there and
goes to bed I'm like how did this happen
Ollie is currently trying to fall asleep
right now he's just kind of laying there
but he laid there for like five minutes
just can see
eyes like open and then he rolled over
and now he's trying to fall asleep on
his belly but it's just so crazy because
I definitely didn't like do that when he
was like I mean ever I've always just
kind of nursed him to sleep somehow he
just decided he can go to sleep without
me nursing him because now he actually
doesn't fall asleep when I nursed him
it's almost like he doesn't like to fall
asleep he just wants to nurse for a
really long time and then I lay him in
his crib and then he won't go to bed so
crazy because I feel so lucky that he
just is able to kind of put himself to
sleep I'm trying to get him to sleep cuz
we've been busy busy busy and he's a
little bit grouchy right now so if he
takes a nap then hopefully we can get
more stuff done so I get the feeling
that someone was driving my car and
didn't tell me because all of my mirrors
I did just all my mirrors just II just
the I adjusted this mirror
um and my music was on the radio and I
never listen to the radio because my
phone connects to it automatically and
then just plays whatever I was playing
on iTunes last someone pretty much stole
my car so I'm getting ready to film a
lookbook for my channel really excited
about it cuz I haven't really done
anything like this before and they're
just sounds like something fun to do but
it's kind of like a big video I guess
it's kind of detailed in a way I'm
getting ready to do my hair I have like
six outfits and we're going to a
location so there's give me a lot of
like outfit changes and like all like I
have to change everything like my
jewelry and my hair maybe a little bit
and stuff like that but I am really
excited about it so I'm going to curl my
hair because that always just gives it a
little bit more like cuteness I love my
hair okay so I got the GK if you tell GK
like taming thing so like makes it so
that I feel like really curly frizzy
hair and it straightens it for you I got
out of the shower last night all I did
was kind of blow-dry it a little bit and
first of all it was so easy to blow-dry
second all it blow-dried actually
straight and then I slept on it just
kind of straight last night and he even
like basically stayed straight and I was
like oh my gosh my has never done that
I'm all ready to go and all he's still
taking his nap but I'm gonna have to
wake him up he's been asleep long enough
and it
kind of a late nap anyways and it really
wants to be much longer so I'll pick him
up
hi baby
oh did you say good I'm waving your
hairs is sticking straight up
I know online maybe you should give
yourself a minute
oh excuse you my goodness you watched
him wake up like that it was crazy he
just like wakes up and he's like hi I am
awake a hair sticking up gessica fie foe
fum where is my cute son color come here
good morning the plan Emily said that
pointing is actually like a sign of
intelligence
it could be actually I feel like he's
just so observant like he's always just
like looking and trying to like figure
everything out it's really interesting I
think that he is gonna be really smart
we got to all right Missy is on outfit
