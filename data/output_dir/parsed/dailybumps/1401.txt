Holly look at the cute fishes buddy look
at them all swim in not cool duh-duh he
like watching all the little fishies on
your ceiling buddy
he's like duh this is our son baby
boy he's gonna do amazing things
good morning guys hey what do you think
of the snapback I've never worn
snapbacks before but when I was little
actually but um I bought this like a
couple days ago and then I didn't really
like it for some reason and now I'm like
I could actually couldn't find my normal
hat that I wear all the time
so I threw it on and I was like maybe I
don't know I know a lot of people rock
it different ways or whatever but I just
throw that on I have a big head and I
don't mean that in terms of dqo but like
I just have a physically big head I feel
very bad for my mom so it's hard for me
to wear hats in general donate I'm
rocking it this guy is playing around
his room I'm just working on actually
next week's episode of look who's
vlogging and gotta send that out today
buddy
you look at this this thing is crazy
heads shoulders knees and toes knees and
toes
heads shoulders knees and toes knees and
toes
here's a heart like even how cool is
that buddy I love you God loves kids so
much is that is that booger in your hair
it's lunch time yay what are you eating
though these are just snackies by the
way I give all these little snacks that
I wants them all and now all of a sudden
they're different colors look at them
those pink ones and like the more
tannish colored ones and before they
were all tan but I haven't even changed
the flavor they're the same flavor so I
don't know if I was getting like I don't
know why they're all weird now but he
loves these little snackies he loves be
able to feed himself
but this is not much right now I'm going
to do seem peach applesauce and winter
squash I want to get back to making him
some food I wanna go to the farmers
market and buy a bunch of different
fruits it's just hard I think the one
thing that I'm finding difficult is
being able to give him a big variety of
lots of veggies and fruits because
there's an I know at the farmers market
and especially even at stores it's hard
to find all the veggies and fruits that
they would give you like in the packet
so you know what it means today you're
having squash and peach applesauce sound
good all right so
me and my mom are hanging out and
Cassie's back there too and we're
running a bunch of errands doing things
that need to be done Oliver has actually
been quite good but he's got this
terrible runny nose that I just really
feel like I need to deal with as much as
I'm pretty sure it's teething I just
feel so bad it's starting to just get
like really Gras and gross and then now
he sound like these really really red
cheeks so bad I feel like I need to get
him something to help out because I just
don't think he's very happy right now
all right so I picked up some Highlands
baby tiny cold tablets for oli if you're
wondering why the cameras moving it's
because I'm moving my legs waiting so
grouchy's past couple days so you woke
up with snot in his hair
getting back yeah Holly try these
he's on copy are you sure we shouldn't
roll it in a piece of cheese I didn't
kill me okay mm-hmm he's like wait wait
a second
yummy huh yeah I would say eight out of
ten times that Missi leaves with her mom
and she leaves my car so that I can like
go do errands and stuff
she has my keys and not only my original
keys that I take everywhere but the
spare key because usually she's lost the
original keys and so she's using a spare
key and it's all in a purse so sure
enough when she was running out doing
things with her mom she had both my keys
and so I'm like late to do things but
trying to run to the bank before they
close just stopped by Best Buy shout out
to Ashley I'm at Ashley at Best Buy and
she was really cool now
I'm gonna go do some boating a dumb
things boring add up things you know I'm
saying you home same same same oh my
gosh you guys I just spent like 30
minutes trying to get this K back to
sleep and now I'm exhausted I was like
laying is uh rocking him in his rocking
chair forever and now I just like oh no
I could be rocked to sleep oh it's just
been one of those days where I just want
to nap pretty excited I got a tripod to
replace that one we've been using it
broke on the top so I can't like go up
and down anymore and it's kind of
essential to some video creating things
I texted my friend Ashley and she's like

look who's my little baby you're the
perfect little faces ever I think he
actually got a pretty dang good nap now

snail problem hon dad if you have a

himself and then I swear he took a step
that Brian doesn't believe me because he
would even though he was right there

walking but I'm probably just gonna keep
saying that until he actually walks it
