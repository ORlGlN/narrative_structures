interesting fresh words actually
all right ollie let's get started we're
rolling hey guys so welcome to the third
week of all about ollie

with Starbucks so you can let me know if
I'm totally butchering this I don't even
know what I'm doing except got some ice
I got some coffee
I'm just gonna pour some coffee in there
like that is that what I do that man
that's probably not right
oh yeah milk do you think it needs milk
or some milk Tom it's turning into a
milkshake be honest gonna be very honest
got some chocolate for the mocha that
came out really fast now I'm gonna put
it in the blender if you need more ice
actually more ice here we go guys ready
now the best part whipped cream boom and
then of course guy talking on top of
that oh yeah and then you have homemade
Starbucks
what up son um it's pretty good huh it
is really good I think it's kind of
worth going to Starbucks though because
I have just made a mess in the kitchen
karma what happened
karma what happened right here that was
your octopus you loved him you guys were
best friends and now look he's a simple
shell of what it used to be sad day come
come on karma karma loves to race me up
the stairs huh let's go let's race go go
go go go go go joke's on you we're not
racing you just went fast and it was for
nothing what you got you got another
friend come here what you got
that's your cow all right someone is way
too hyper did you drink my property no
Oliver just got changed in his apple
bottom cheeks diapers full of poo right
the parent crew was looking at you it's
really gross there's stuff in there baby
got change alright I'm alright that was
pretty good I was done very mad at you
were like no I need clothes I want to
remake it forever
don't we all Oliver don't we all our
worst nightmare just happened
well not our worst nightmare but part of
it I was going down the stairs with the
laundry basket and I totally slipped and
biffed it and my frickin my whole body
hurts so bad my lip is probably going to
get very swollen because
I bid it and so now it's bleeding that's
awesome what he wasn't moving I was a
holding the baby I totally like rug rash
my whole elbow on my side and I smacked
the laundry basket in my nose and I was
like hoping it was I was kept holding my
nose thinking I was gonna bleed and then
blood started coming out of my mouth so
yeah that's really gnarly Oh Appy oh
that's right you don't say here's the
really funny part he was literally about
to press record yeah I was I was going
down the stairs about the press record
on the camera and Oh sucks so let's hope
my yeah my lips gonna get huge you guys
I can feel it hurts so bad oh oh oh so
not that you guys all fleshed out Oh No
thank God I wasn't holding the baby
though right not would have been
horrible thumbs up that I'm okay and the
baby's okay I'm just I know I'm gonna
have a fat lip and this is all gonna get
all bruised up and stuff could have been
a lot worse though could have been a lot
worse
the thing is too is that I already have
huge lips because I'm noticed I have
huge lips and now they're probably gonna
get fatter because they're gonna get
swollen tonight we're attempting to make
fried spicy or spicy fried chicken bits
their faith okay they're not fry than
fate but this must be like crispy and
we're doing spicy which my family does
not be spicy but we are kind of all
wanting spicy so we're going for it but
the only thing is that the feathers mom
no it smells factors looks great a
little bit of her rhythms yeah this
wasn't animal I am sorry to say okay so
I guess we'll see how that turns out it
sounds delicious
all right guys you gotta see that we
have a dingo he's in the outback if I
can tell you them
there he is he's sitting in his little
wood she was like a little dingo I
definitely made a reference for
Australia just now oh it see that that
Hey ladies like it all right show us
your little bed you made all right so
when we moved here he made like himself
a little bed in the bushes and he like
pushed down all these bushes so he can
lay and here I'm guessing it's probably
a bit cooler like laying on the leaves
but it is quite hilarious when you see
him laying in the bushes he's like a
little dingo a little Australian dingo
huh this is hard to do to bend over and
grab a bowl but you got a baby it's like
I'm pregnant again oh I can't just
through and Oliver kind of moved right
hand
