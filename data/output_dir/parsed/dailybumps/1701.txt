this is what 9:00 in the morning looks
like look at that sky
it's not even sunny it's basically
telling us to go back to bed okay
look at how speaking to PS oh we were
going to me what you thought I did did
you really I did we are in the car and
we are headed to Missy's appointment
what is that perinatal yes going to a
perinatal appointment her new perinatal
doctor every time I say perinatal I feel
like I'm spitting everywhere oh it was
funny because we're driving and Missy's
like are you paying attention to where
we're going cuz this is the route to the
hospital
once he's deciding that he's coming and
to be honest I have not been paying
attention at all he just really hoped
that my phone GPS is working at the time
we have to run out of the house we're
actually thinking though that we really
need to start getting the bag ready the
bag that we're gonna take to the
hospital is so funny help the first
thing they ask you when you sit down is
are you in any pain
no yeah I'm pretty sure that I am 34
Lee's pregnant
yeah I guess being 34 weeks pregnant
doesn't count as painting yeah oh she
put zero as your pain scale okay you're
like really deal like holding his baby
down from like punching a rib out now
you're in no pain just had a delicious
lunch at Panera bread's misty was
craving bread cuz she hasn't been
well she just didn't eat a lot today
what do you do it are you playing candy
crush because you are a dick dad so what
actually confidence that they don't on
level 220 something you see that missing
that's insane I the app is on my phone
but I don't want to open it because I
don't want to become obsessed so he's
got back from my appointment and
everything went really well he is
actually measuring at a little over five
pounds which is crazy he's just getting
so big so yeah but everything went
really well they checked my cervix and
they seem to be the same she said she
thought they were closed I don't know if
she mmm I don't really know if I believe
that I think I am still on it but I
don't think I'm any bigger than it once
so that that's good that means I'm still
not dilating and now I'm like weekly
appointments I've now scheduled every
single appointment until my due date
every single week I'm exhausted I'm
gonna take a little nap because I'm just
super tired it's kind of like relaxi

at me wink he's tired too we all just
want to relax huh oh I'm gonna do that
thing that Missy Missy hates it when he
does it sorry alright okay everyone's
just relaxing in front of a fan okay
