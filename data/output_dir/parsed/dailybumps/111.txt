-  Good Morning.
- Good morning.
Good morning family.
We are up in the woods living life
a little bit easier.
- Yay.
- Life just moves a little bit slower
up here in the woods.
We've been hanging out in our cabin.
Yesterday we went to the
tree lighting ceremony.
If you missed that blog,
check out that icon.
I'll having it above so you can watch.
Finn, can you do a little dance?
A little dance.
Oh, oh, oh.
I love his Santa's Little Helper shirt.
(Missy giggles)
It's so cute.
Was that Ollie's shirt ?
- Yeah, It's a pajama shirt but
I think it's cute.
- Yeah.
- I think it was actually CJ's.
- Aww, that's cute.
The boys have been enjoying
running around with nature.
It's been kinda nice,
they are kind of just
occupying themselves.
Hey Luna, you are kinda tangled up there.
What are you trying to do Ollie?
- I'm trying to clime the tree.
- Okay, well let's see
you try and climb it.
Finn's like I'll just jump up the tree.
(upbeat guitar music)
- So we just got to the park and
we are gonna let the kids
play and go on a little walk.
We just got out of the car and
look what we just realized.
- I'm wearing my handy dandy slippers.
- He is wearing his slippers still
- Yeah.
- Do they just feel like shoes?
- I just do it all the time.
I put on comfy slippers and I forget
and then I leave the house and
then people make fun of me.
- So he is gonna go back to the house
and get his shoes so
we can go hike a little
and I will wait here with the kids
and Meme and Papa and Auntie and Uncle.
You wanna go with Mama?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, alright let's go.
We made it to the community
Idyllwild playground.
Are you gonna play, play, play?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
-  Are you gonna Play?
- Yeah.
- You are so excited, huh?
Someone took their shoes off thought
so I gotta spend ten minutes putting
them back on for you, okay?
(Missy giggles)
You ever wonder why Finn
isn't wearing shoes sometimes
it's because they take forever to put on.
Okay, shoes are on.
It's time to play.
Look at him go, look at him go.
Are you going to climb up?
- No.
-  No, too little still.
(upbeat guitar music)
Look who I just spotted.
It's Meme, wave your arms Meme.
- Hey Meme!
-  Oh, there's Ollie.
Dad will you push us?
-  Here we go.
That's going to knock you over, kid.
(Finn squeals)
- Spin around Mama.
- That that does not look fun.
- Uh, a little sick.
(squealing)
(upbeat guitar music)
Oh, gosh, oh gosh.
Don't throw up Ollie.
-  Are you okay, Ollie?
He is lookin a little pinked.
Are you dizzy?
- Okay, ready?
- Push.
-  Good.

(upbeat guitar music)
-  Alright, we do this every year.
-  Whoa.

(Missy giggles)
(Ollie screams)
(Missy laughs)
Alright, get out.
-  Wait, you gotta go
the other way to unwind ya.
Wait, let me get the
throw up out of there.
(Missy giggles)
Oh look, the got a hole for throw up.
-  Yeah.
For all of the throw up,
it just goes right down.
- That was so bad.
(Missy giggles)
-  Alright, it's Finn's turn.
Are you ready?
- Yeah.
-  Okay.
-  Now his name is Spinny.
(Missy giggles)
Not Finny, it's Spinny.
-  Spin.
(Finn squeals)
A little faster.
He is so cute.
-  Go spinny, go spinny.
(Missy giggles)
- I'm gonna unwind you now.
You won't be dizzy if
you go the other way.
-  We undo what happened.
-  Okay, let's see how dizzy he is.
-  Oh ga, what.
Look at that.
(Missy giggles)
-  He is like jumping.
Alright, Auntie's turn.
Do you want me to spin you
because I'm really good at it.
- As fast as you can.
I want no mercy.
(Auntie squeals)
Okay, I feel sick.

Keep moving by. Oh no.

Can he hold on?
Auntie, help.
(Missy laughs)
- I'm okay.
-  Okay, spin, hard.
Go.
Come on.
-  Okay, now you

The best thing is to walk
straight towards the fence here.
-  Okay.
So your walk.
(Missy giggles)
One, two.
-  Why do you put
your head down like that?
- I don't know.
-  You look even crazier.
(screaming)
-  There.
Now let her jump upside
down, that's funny.
(laughing)
(unintelligible)
- Are you going to make fun of each other?
- I get very dizzy when
I do things like that.
-  Are you guys dizzy yet?
(laughing)
-  Okay, I'm gonna fall out.
-  You can't fall out.
- We'd thought you would give
you a first person thing.
Let us know if you got busy, or
if you got dizzy.
Wow, I'm still so sick.
(upbeat guitar music)
Oh, shoot.
-  Is he okay?
-  He is okay.
-  Oh gosh.
-  Don't let him go.
-  Just let him go, he is fine.
-  Let him go.
-  Let me go, I am good.
- He isn't taking long to recover.
(everyone laughs)
-  Climb all together.
There you go.
-  Now can you come over here?
-  There you go.
-  That one is lava.
-  Lava, don't let it touch.
-  Don't touch it,
can you make it over here to mom?
(squealing)
Oh no.
Alright, it's not real, it's not lava.
It's like jelly bean lava.
It's like lots of jelly beans,
don't squish the jelly beans.
-  There you go.
-  Careful, careful.
(screams)
You are almost...
-  What is that thing?
-  It's not really hot lava.
-  Go right here.
-  It's jelly beans.
-  We are gonna have
to do a hot lava rescue.
(screaming)
- Jelly beans, don't
touch the jelly beans.
-  He is literally biting it.
-  Finn, You can't bite it.
-  We found a new way to hanging on.
See, you didn't think
of it like that did you?
No, don't.
-  No stop.
- He heard the word jelly bean I think.
-  Yeah, we told him
to grab his jelly beans.
He is biting the things.
Go Finn go.
Go Finn Go.
Whoa.
Are you going so high with Auntie?
(Finn Giggles)
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
I'm gonna get you.
(Ollie screams)
- Ollie is doing a big boy swing.
-  Yay.
- I want you to do higher.
- Higher?
- Yeah.
-  Wooo.
Can you hold on?
- I'm afraid his little
bum gonna slip out of it.
-  I know.
(upbeat guitar music)
(upbeat guitar music)
-  We are going for a little walk.
And the boys have found a log.
What do you see?
- There's a playground too.
-  A playground, yeah.
-  Alright, we gotta
get a picture of Luna.
- Come here.
-  Come on girl.
I don't know what you want.
Go Luna, go.
- You're up, yay.
-  Yay.
Let's take a beautiful
pictures of you now.
-  Whoa dude.
Good job.
Finn, you wanna try and stand on it.
That one is really tall Ollie.
Go Finn.
Yay, that's so cool.
They have these cool little
activities you can do
throughout the park.
This is seriously so
beautiful, look at this.
This is a little walking path
next to Strawberry Creek.
Do you see any squirrels yet?
- Nope.
-  And what are you supposed to do
when you see a squirrel?
(animal noise)
Yep, you gotta do the squirrel call.
Don't fall in that creek.
(giggles)
You too Finn, okay.
Did you see any squirrels yet?
- No.
- No.
We found a squirrel you guys.
Well, Luna found a squirrel.
Oh and now the squirrel
is gone because of Ollie.
Luna, she found a squirrel didn't you?
She pointed her body towards
it to show us where it was.
She heard us looking for it.
Clearly, she is the smartest
dog in the whole world.
Don't worry folks.
That squirrel is safely
eating up in the tree now.
Oh, he dropped his nut.
Oh, he is like Oh, I dropped my nut.
(Missy giggles)
What am I going to do now?
Oh, did these people see me drop it?
This is so embarrassing you guys.
Dropped a nut right on YouTube.
(upbeat guitar music)
We are back from our little forest walk.
Back at the cabin.
Everyone is asleep or
relaxing or lounging.
It's like one of the very few times
that I think us as a family of four
have gotten to stop and just
not worry about anything
and just be comfortable
and enjoy ourselves
and enjoy each other.
We have been having such
an amazing cabin trip.
This is something we love to do
every year up here in Idyllwild.
It's always a fun time.
We are definitely enjoying the cabin.
I'm gonna be quiet.
I'm going to let everyone rest now.
(upbeat guitar music)
- Whoa.
-  It's like
cheersing your knuckles.
Good morning guys.
How was your nap?
- Good.
-  It was good?
- Yeah.
- We actually drove down to a little cafe
really close to our cabin and
now we are getting dinner.
And Ollie is obsessed with cheersing.
Hey Finn, how is that edamame?
-  Is it good?
-  Yeah, he is eating that stuff.
- He doesn't like the spicy
but if I take them out without
letting him touch then he is good.
-  Yeah.
He loves it.
- Watch this.
-  What?
- This.
- And then you drink that, whoa.
And you mix em?
He is mixing lemonade and
water, ladies and gentlemen.
Never has this been done before.
But will he drink it?
Did you drink it?
Prove it.
He drank it.
(giggles)
-  It has chocolate chips on it.
-  Yes it does.
What did you decide to eat
for dinner tonight, Ollie?
- Um, pancakes.
-  Yeah, cause pancakes,
is that your favorite food?
Yeah.
- I mean Ollie is basically an elf.
-  Yeah, I know right?
(Missy giggles)
Elves eat pancakes and syrup for dinner.
- Finn, do you want a pickle?
- No.
-  We are seeing if Finn wants
to try a pickle for the first time.
- Try it.
Alright, you try it.
(Bryan giggles)
You try it.
-  Nope.
No one wants to try the pickles.
-  I just made hot
chocolate for all of us.
We even got some for Finn,
Ollie, and Mommy, and Daddy.
Are you excited?
- Yeah.
-  What are we missing?
- Marshmallows.
-  Yeah, we gotta
add the marshmallows.
There is some for Ollie.
-  Hot chocolate with marshmallows.
You can't drink it without.
But some people don't
drink it with marshmallows,
they drink it with whipped cream.
- I'm just gonna do a little for me.
-  Oh.
- I think they are good,
I just don't need a ton.
- Let us know down below in the comments
and an the icon above.
What do you like on your hot chocolate?
Whipped cream or mini marshmallows?
Ollie, you're digging
the marshmallows huh?
This is our hot cocoa set up.
Sitting out back in the cabin.
Is it yummy?
- Yeah.
-  Just take a little sip.
You gotta get a marshmallow, huh?
-  Is that good?
- Yeah.
- It is very good hot cocoa.
Hot cocoa is best.
-  It's so good, huh?
We are also just sitting back here
and we realized you can
see the Christmas tree
right down there all lit up.
- Cool.
-  I know you can even
see it zoomed out like this.
It's that blue spot.
- Come out here, turn
on some Christmas music
and did our own countdown to
the Christmas tree lighting.
-  True.
