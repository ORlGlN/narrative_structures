I'm gonna go grub on this now.
Ahhh.
- So I just got home from the gym,
and oh my gosh,
we worked mainly arms,
my whole body is in so
much pain right now,
I'm like, shaking.
But --
- Hi.
- I did it.
And I actually like, I think
I would have convinced myself
not to go if it wasn't for
someone who's coming with me,
which is Kelsey.
So I'm glad I went, cause
I feel good about it.
I did wanna show you this, though.
When we went to Alabama,
Katie had these for the kids,
and I thought they were so cute,
and so convenient that I
had to buy one for Finn,
and look at him.
It's basically like
this little water brush,
and you brush it on here,
and it starts to bring
life to the picture,
and like color, and it
shows little flowers
that you didn't see before.
Isn't that cute?
(gasp)
-  Pretty.
-  Wow!
Isn't that cool?
- Yeah.
(Missy laughing)
(upbeat music)
-  We've got
ourselves a little visitor!
Hi June.
- Me and June are catching up.
She's been super busy, so.
- Look at these faces she makes.
(Missy laughing)
Yeah, Corsey and Kel --
Kelsey and Corbin are over
and we're all just getting work done
and hanging out.
- Did you say his name Corsey?
- Corsey?
- Corsey.
- Hey, there you go.
(upbeat music)
(suspenseful music)
-  Ollie, welcome back from school!
You had a fun day at school, right?
Daddy told you that you had a
prize when you get home, huh?
What is it?
(suspenseful music)
- A robot!
-  It's Kai's robot!
Is that pretty cool?
(Finn babbling)
Isn't that so neat?
- Yeah!
- Even Finn's excited.
I think Ollie's really excited.
Yeah, Bryan's been working on it
for a few days.
I ended up finishing it,
or helping him finish it last night,
so me and Bryan had our
fun putting it together,
and now Ollie gets to have his fun.
So you gonna take it apart, Ollie?
- Mm-hmm.
-  Yes?
I thought you were gonna try
and keep it all together.
Watch this, go stand like right there.
Okay, ready?
Nah --
(shooting sound effect)
Ah, gotcha.
- Oh no.
Oh no,
oh no,
oh no!
Ah!
(laughing)
Did you see your Lego?
Yeah, Mama finished it,
wasn't that so nice of her?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Why are you climbing on top of me?
This is like a real life Hop on Pop book
right here, huh?
(Ollie blows raspberry)
Ah!
This is what happens
when the kids get home.
(laughing)
So if you guys have been
watching our channel,
you know a lot about our house.
You've seen a lot of it.
Missy has done a house
tour on her channel,
which I'll have linked
above in the description.
It's very thorough.
But a lot of things have
changed since then as well.
So there's some things that have changed,
and there are some things
that you also haven't seen
about our house that we
have yet to tell you about.
And I think today might be a good day
to show you guys.
You wanna see something
you've never seen before?
Let's go.
Hey, Finn!
Do you want to show them the secret room?
- Yeah!
- Yeah?
What are you doing?
You putting your hand in?
I see the boys come out here all the time
and put their hands and feet in.
(Bryan laughing)
Can you climb it?
Let's see if you can climb it.
Go ahead.
I don't know if he can.
Oh my gosh.
(Bryan laughing)
Hey, let's go inside and show
them the secret room, okay?
(Finn babbling)
(suspenseful music)
Hey Ollie?
- What?
- You know how we have this secret room?
- Mm-hmm.
- What do you think lives in there?
- I don't know.
-  Well what do you
think lives in the basement?
- Vampires.
- Vampires?
Vampires don't live in there.
So we have a secret room,
and I think we're gonna
show it to you guys.
You wanna see what's inside?
- Mm-hmm.
-  Should we show you too?
- Yeah.
- The kids aren't really
even allowed down here
very often, huh?
All right, so we thought
it was finally time
to show you guys what's behind this door.
We haven't really shown it a lot.
We don't really let the
kids down there a a lot,
to be honest,
there's stairs going down,
and they're pretty steep stairs, so.
You guys ready to see?
- I'm so afraid.
-  You don't need to be afraid.
- I think it's all good, okay?
No vampires, promise.
-  So we also keep this door locked
because we don't want the
kids climbing down there.
What do you see?
What do you see?
- Um.
-  Is it dark?
- No.
-  Is it spooky?
(clock ticking)
All righty, come on down.
- Hello.
Ooh, see these stairs are so steep.
-  So this is our top secret room.
(Bryan laughing)
- There it is.
Is it so big?
-  Yeah.
- So yeah, we have a
basement in California, guys.
- Which is very rare.
- Very, very rare.
I don't know if we've ever even,
have we vlogged down here?
- No.
- Shown them anything?
I don't think we ever have.
So this is a treat.
Welcome to our huge basement.
(Missy laughing)
It's not that big.
It's really not that big.
- I wish it was bigger.
This would be so cool if it
was like, like a theater room.
-  Totally.
- Or workout room.
- Tell me what you guys think
is actually realistic.
Cause I was thinking,
how interesting would it be
to have a contractor come in here,
tear out all these walls,
and just dig,
and make it bigger?
- I don't know, like,
how to build on foundations,
I don't know.
- I don't know how any of it works.
All I know is it's pretty
cool we found a house
that actually has a basement.
- Yeah, we've had a lot of people come in,
who were like looking
to do work or something,
and they'll like come to the basement,
and like, you have a basement?
I've been to hundreds
of homes in this area
and they've never seen a basement.
-  Yeah.
- So though it's small,
but it's still a basement.
-  Totally.
So what've we got?
What's going on down here, babe?
- So this is kind of our secret room,
where a lot of our props are,
things for videos,
- We have lots of costumes,
masks, these are all just --
- Even lighting stuff to make videos,
a lot of like our video production --
-  We have like holiday stuff,
like wrapping.
What did you find?
-  Oh goodness.
-  So we also
have a little toy stash.
- Our toy stash.
(Missy laughing)
-  Just little toys
that we've never opened
and have acquired.
- Little trinkets that
we've kind of collected
through the years.
-  And this closet.
- Oh my gosh, this is kind of a mess.
Like every single costume that you can --
- Yeah.
If you guys have watched us for awhile,
you've seen all these.
We have acquired so
many different costumes
and props, it's crazy.
Oh my gosh, what have we got?
We've got Christmas, we've got --
-  Oh, there's Belle.
-  There's Belle.
We've got dinosaurs.
-  Captain Hook.
- This is the parrot
from the Captain Jake,
we've got Wendy, wigs.
-  Even like
wigs, yeah, tons of wigs.
-  Shoes.
-  Oh here's Tinkerbell.
- Tinkerbell's costume.
Cause you know, we like to
do lots of different things
on this channel, so we've like,
we've put up vlogs, we've put up skits,
we've put up fun family things.
- And kids have lots of costumes
that they --
-  Experiments.
- Yeah, the kids have lots of costumes
that they like to dress up in,
and sometimes we like to dress up too.
-  Totally.
(Finn babbling)
So like in here we have storage bins
for more Halloween costumes,
and other things that we've --
-  This one is almost
all the Toy Story costume.
-  Oh that's cool.
Yeah.
-  Christmas stuff.
-  Masks.
- Oh, you guys remember this?
This one we just recently did.
-  Yeah, all our cool masks.
- Lots of party stuff in
here, so if you guys know --
-  Like chalkboards.
- Lots of empty stuff too.
- So here in this cabinet
is actually some roosters.
(laughing)
My grandma collected roosters for so long,
and I have acquired a couple,
and they're not really a
part of like, our, decor?
So we keep them down here.
-  We keep them around.
-  That's a good rooster.
- We still have party
favors from when was this?
Let's see.
-  Oh is that the --
- This is Finn's, Finn's party favors.
- No way!
That's so cool!
So we had like, look at, dude!
Here, you want a bag?
You can have a bag,
you've been a good boy.
-  There you go, bud.
-  We've got balloons,
confetti, streamers --
- More party stuff.
- All kinds of stuff.
- Look, here's all the pirate party stuff.
- Oh, pirate stuff.
If we ever want to be pirates.
- Yep.
We even have some decor things,
and actually a lot of decor things
that went with parties,
so this was like for
Kelsey and Corbin's party.
-  Oh yeah.
- So many things.
-  Yes.
- But you know what?
I like putting on parties,
so you never know when we're
gonna throw another one.
- And a lot of times, if
we have people coming over,
we'll just come down here
and grab some balloons --
-  Yeah.
- Or something and just
throw something together.
- Yeah, I've (mumbles) for so many parties
by just getting the
stuff that's down here.
-  Yeah.
- Instead of having to go to the store.
- Yeah.
And that is our top secret room, you guys.
Basement tour, room tour,
top secret house tour, I don't know.
There you go.
Now you've seen it.
Seen it all.
Have they seen it all?
- They haven't seen it all.
- There may be a couple
of other surprise rooms.
So just stay subscribed to this channel,
keep watching our videos every single day,
maybe you'll see them, I don't know.
(door closing)
(lock jingling)
And keep it locked.
- And this is why the kids
aren't allowed down there.
-  Yeah.
(laughing)
Random party chocolate from a year ago.
(laughing)
-  I know, is this even good?
(Finn babbling)
-  It's like a chocolate coin!
You want it?
-  Karma, no, you can't have it.
-  You can have it, Finn.
You've been such a good boy today.
- He's trying to close his eyes.
-  Why is he closing his eyes?
- Because he wants to go to bed.
-  He's tired?
- Mm-hmm.
-  Are you tired, Karma?
Karma got a little owie on his nose.
- Aww, that's his,
Karma, don't move away.

and fire!
Isn't that neat?
