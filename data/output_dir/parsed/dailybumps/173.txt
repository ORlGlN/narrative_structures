-  Look at these cute boys
holding their tight hands.
You're bringing your teddy
bear home, huh Ollie?
Yeah (laughs), they're so cute.
♫ Wherever you are,
that's where I wanna be
♫ All it took was a laugh
and that soft sunset
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said
♫ This is home
♫ Just running around
you never looked so cute
♫ Hugging you tight
cuddling all I could singing
♫ I am home
♫ Home forever you're with me
- And good morning, guys.
We are headed out of the house.
I'm taking Ollie to school,
I packed his lunch for him
and I am actually headed to the gym
and I am excited, I have
my personal trainer today
and you know what, as you guys know
I ran three miles yesterday
and I'm actually like,
not that sore, like, not like last week
I thought I was gonna die.
This week I just ran
three miles and I'm like,
I feel pretty good.
So I'm really proud of myself.
Let's do it, okay?
- Yes.
-  Are you gonna have
a fun day at school today?
- Yeah, there's my shadow right there.
-  Oh, that is your shadow, huh?
-  Yeah.
-  Hey Ollie, today
you're gonna go to school
and Peyton's not gonna be there, okay?
Yeah, today Peyton is just getting home,
I think they might be traveling home today
from Playlist so.
He'll be okay though, huh?
-  Morning, how's it going Batman?
You're reading The Big Fun
Preschool Activity Book.
That's so cool.
Good morning guys.
Yes, while Ollie is away
at actual preschool,
Finn is aspiring to join himself.
I think he may be headed
to school next year, huh?
He wants to go to school early.
No, I don't think we're gonna
be giving him up next year.
What?
(garbled baby talk)
Oh really, okay, let's keep looking.
So this is art class,
oh, look at this, flowers
and kites.
He's genuinely so
interested, it's so funny.
Also, he slept in his Batman pajamas.
Tried to change him this morning
and he was adamant that he
wanted to stay Batman, right?
- No.
-  You are Batman, huh?
(laughs) You hear that little no he does?
It's so forceful too, he's like, no.
Look who's Batman, yes, you're Batman,
I'm not gonna take it off (laughs).
- Alright, I am home and I
had a pretty busy morning.
I ended up going to the
gym which was really good,
my workout was like, whew, tough.
I ran a little less,
I ran almost two miles
but I ended up having to
cut it short for a reason
so anyways, I'm now home and
getting things cleaned up.
I just put Finn down for a nap
because he was ready.
But he was so cute because
he hadn't see me all morning,
he was like, Momma, hi, hi,
he's like giving me kisses
and hugs, it was so cute.
Now I'm actually pretty hungry
so I need to eat some lunch probably.
I hate lunch, I literally hate lunch,
I hate trying to find food,
I hate trying to like, figure
out what I want for lunch.
Like lunches are just like the worst.
Like, I don't like sandwiches, like,
what do you eat for lunch,
let me know in the comments,
what do you eat for lunch
because I'm not a big sandwich person
and so, like, lunch is
supposed to be like small
and I'm like, I don't know what to eat,
I can never figure out what to eat so,
let me know what you guys eat
and maybe I'll get some good ideas.
Look who's up from his nap.
Did you sleep so good?
We are right now rushing out of the house
because it is time to pick up Ollie.
Oh you see Papa, look at that.
I didn't know he was here.
Alright we made it, we
gotta go get your brother,
are you excited?
He's like so excited to see Ollie.
(garbled baby noises)
Yeah, let's go get him, okay?
- Okay.
(soothing music)
-  Are you up?
Good morning.
- Good morning.
-  Did you have fun at school?
Is that your monkey?
Say hi.
Were you doing puzzles over here?
- Yeah.
-  How fun.
Yeah.
Go down the slide, Finn.
Come on.
Ready
go.
Ah, good job.
Finn is going to be so
happy when he's in school.
Look at these cute boys
holding their tight hands.
You're bringing your teddy
bear home, huh Ollie?
Yeah, (laughs) they're so cute.
I think that when it's time
for Finn to go to school
he's going to be very excited.
Every time we go there
he just gets so excited,
he wants to play with all the toys
he wants to run around with all the kids
and he doesn't realize that
he's just a little baby still.
But it's actually, it does get me excited
for when the time comes
because I think that he's gonna be excited
to do the same thing
that his brother's doing,
but Ollie, how did school go?
- Good.
- Good, were you good?
Did you get in any trouble?
Good, you just eating like,
leftovers of your lunch?
Yep, now how did you do
with Peyton not being there?
- It was good.
- It was okay?
Okay, did you mind it or
would you rather her there?
- Just wanted her.
- Oh, you did want her?
- Yeah (mumbles).
-  Oh yeah, alright,
well she'll be back next time, okay?
- What about (mumbles) Bailey?
-  Yeah, we'll (mumbles)
Bailey soon too, okay?
- I have fun at school and
now it's time for Target.
-  Woohoo, what are
we gonna get at Target?
- Um, some snacks.
Maybe some toys too.
-  Um, I don't
think we're gonna get toys
because you're still saving up, huh?
Alright, we made it to Target
and the boys are snacking.
What do you got, Ollie?
- A cherry, um.
- Icee?
- Icee.
- Yeah.
We're basically just kind of
doing some random shopping.
I needed some clothes for the boys,
they were kind of getting low
because they grow out of them so quickly
and then I gotta grab a few things maybe
apple juice and a couple
things for Ollie's lunches.
Huh?
- (mumbles) for Halloween.
- Oh yeah, we totally need
decorations for Halloween.
I actually think we might
have plenty of decorations
up in the attic, we just
have to get them all down.
Are you all done with your popcorn?
They do however have some
really fun Halloween books
that we probably don't have.
That might be fun to get, huh?
Halloween ABC.
You're learning your ABC's, huh?
- A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
-  (laughs) Good job.
Okay, we'll get that one.
So we're just about to leave
but I got Finn this
little Batman water bottle
because he's obsessed with Ollie's
and he doesn't have one.
So look at him, he's so excited.
Okay, I just cleaned it out
and put water in it for him.
How is it?
- Good.
- Good, you love it?
- Batman,
(hums Batman theme)
Batman.
-  Even when you go to school
you have matching shirts.
Ollie.
- What did you do today?
-  Tell us all about
your homework you did.
Show Daddy.
- Whoa.
- It was good.
- What is this?
- A.
(cheering)
-  Apple starts with A?
- Yeah.
- That's cool.
-  And what does an A sound like?
- Moo.
- Nope.
(laughing)
- That's not correct.
- Ah.
- Ah.
-  Apple, and did you write those?
- Yeah.
- That's so good.
Did you really write those,
did your teacher help you?
It's very good, yep.
- Smell my feet.
-  What do they smell like?
- I don't know.
-  You want me to smell them?
You want me to smell yours too?
Alright, I got some smelling feet.
Eww!
(laughing)
(coughing)
Ew!
Ew!
(laughing)
Why do you buys have such stinky feet?
- Because.
Smell them Momma.
-  Everyone has to smell the feet.
- Oh, I don't even have
to pretend those stink,
those really do stink.
-  And Finn.
- Yours actually smell good.
(laughing)
-  You know if you
make a funny face like that
it'll get stuck.
And then you'll look like that forever.
(scream)
(laughing)
(playful music)
- You guys I have a little
confession about the chickens.
I'm gonna go show you guys them right now,
I've been talking about a rooster here
and I'm pretty confident
that guy right there
who's running around is a rooster,
but either way we definitely
have at least one rooster
because I have a confession.
The other day we cracked open
an egg and it was fertile
and clearly left out a little too long.
We were all a little traumatized
to be quite honest.
There's definitely a rooster
fertilizing the eggs.
I didn't even think that
they were able to fertilize
at this young of an age.
I mean, he's still so like, little.
Yeah, one of my eggs were
fertile the other day.
Wasn't a baby, it was just 100% fertile
and it was really, really traumatizing.
So anyways, that's definitely a problem.
I don't know if I'm comfortable
with any roosters fertilizing
my eggs that I'm eating.
Especially if I'm gonna be able
to know that they're fertile,
like that's so nasty.
Chickens are doing good though.
They are on chicken scratch,
like chick starter food
so they're not really making me eggs so,
look at that, empty egg box.
Kind of a bummer.
I did have to go out and buy eggs today
which is ridiculous when
you have 11 chickens
but hopefully soon here
we can actually get them
back on regular food.
Alright guys, I'm gonna
fill up your food, okay?
Alright, the chickens
were definitely hungry.
Got their stuff filled up and yeah,
you can definitely laugh at me
because that definitely happened.
Like I said, it wasn't a baby
but if we had left it out
just a little bit longer
definitely could have been.
And I'm honestly pretty freaked out.
You guys'll have to let me know
if you guys are chicken experts,
how long can you eat fertile eggs?
I feel like I read up
on it, it said you can
but you have to get them like, right away
and obviously we didn't get it right away.
So let me know in your
guys' experience with this,
if you have any, leave that
in the comments down below.

Okay, let's try this one.
- The other day it was so funny
because it was Labor Day and
we told Ollie in the morning
that it was a holiday
and that it was Labor Day
and he got so confused and a little scared
and he ran outside of the room
and he went into the dining room
and then came back to the bedroom
and said, yep, it's not Halloween,
the pumpkins are still there.
Because we had like, pumpkin decor set up.
He was so afraid that he
might have missed Halloween
but he didn't and he's very
excited about Halloween
so Missy got some
Halloween books from Target
and now they're reading them
and you are just, what are you doing?
What are you doing, you
just need attention?
Oh my gosh, look at that tongue.
Look at that.
That feels good, you know it feels good
when the tongue comes out.
How's her breath smell?
(upbeat music)
