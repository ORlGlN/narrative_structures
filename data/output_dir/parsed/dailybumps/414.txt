to 10 hours between I started look how
far we got last night this is the front
of the castle it's so good go for
scratch that's amazing huh
it's just so much fun to do together
because it's kind of like a puzzle but
it's kind of like a more complex puzzle
so we've been really enjoying it I'm
trying to keep your kids out so that we
can continue it as possible yeah hey why
don't you stay in your playroom yeah

here snowfall ah there you go
oh hello everybody hi guys I made it to
at the airport and it was a very long
drive but I am you got it coming here I
got my sky bug misty on it be happy and
it is a pretty late flight cycle we just
kind of get on the flight and kind of
mess and relax
it is really weird traveling by myself
because first of all I constantly lose
everything and then like someone's with
maybe like Oh Missy you forgot your
phone or your wallet or something I
always lose something I'm just waiting
for that moment when I lose my phone and
I can't even like call anyone to say
like where's my coat enough so I'm like
super nervous about that but other than
that everything's going good I will say
vlogging by myself is really hard if you
used to having like someone there for
support and when I'm just like talking
to myself
all right the boys are eating dinner
misty has left
I just stolen off a boat and I gotta say
you guys my chicken dumplings turned out
so delicious look at that
mmm just had a bowl of it myself and it
was so good I figured ah she's gone it's
gonna be really hard just to make meals
for one and I don't want to order or eat
out a lot so I made a big crock pot meal
so that I can eat it just everyday
because the tarts of sometimes the kids
don't eat what I eat so I feel like I'd
only be for one so no definitely heli
hey then how are those noodle what do
you eat in great
I have a land in it and it is so late I
slept most like but if you don't know by
now I and then Idaho I'm going to have a
