- All right, the boys are helping
Missy put together an Exersaucer.
Ollie, are you gonna play in this?
- Nope.
- I mean, you're almost too big, huh?
Babe, why are you
building this Exersaucer?
We don't have any babies.
("This is Home" by Bryan Lanning)
♫ Wherever you are,
that's where I wanna be
♫ All it took was a ring
in that soft sunset,
♫ Big blue eyes welled up
and said, "This is home."
♫ Just running around,
you never looked so cute
♫ Hugging you tight, cuddling,
all I could say to you,
♫ "I am home."
♫ Home's wherever you're with me.
(bright guitar music)
- Good morning!
- Good morning! What's up, dude?
- Good.
- Did you have fun yesterday?
- Yeah.
- Yes. If you guys
missed yesterday's blog,
go watch it, it's in the sidebar,
We had so much fun hanging
out with some friends, huh?
And you have been such a good boy,
you've been working on your cotton balls.
Yes, Missy set up this
little cotton ball station
where when he's good, he gets rewarded,
and he fills up his jar with cotton balls,
and look what happened last night, Ollie!
- I filled it up!
- It's full! So what does that mean, mama?
- I get a toy!
- Yeah! He gets to pick out a toy.
- He has been doing really well.
- He has been so good.
- He's been going to bed like a big boy,
he's been sleeping in his bed all night.
- And I can say that since
we've, like, started this,
he hasn't needed a time-out,
he hasn't needed even a warning.
It's been really awesome
and I'm so proud of you.
- It's been really cool.
And you did it, you finally filled it up.
So we're gonna go have a fun day, okay?
Finn woke up very hangry, didn't you?
(laughs) say hi!
- Hey.
- We're going to breakfast,
he's currently eating
muffins and a Pop-Tart to
curb his hangriness, huh?
But I think we're all ready, right?
(Happy music)
- We are here picking out a toy!
-  What are you gonna get, dude?
- A dragon sword!
-  Let's go find it!
Ollie's so excited to get his toy
for being such a good boy.
- He's had something on
his mind for a while now
that he's been wanting.
- Yeah.
We are looking for a wizard wand
that has, like, a wizard in a tower
and the wand kinda looks like a sword,
it looks interesting, huh? We'll find it.
Hey Finn, what did you find?
- Batman!
- Batman?
- Can you sing the song?
- Sing, "Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, Batman!"
- He loves Batman.
I honestly don't know how
Finn got obsessed with Batman
all of a sudden, but...
- I don't know either!
He loves Batman.
- He loves Batman.
-  Ollie! What did we
find? We found the wizard wand!
-  See it?
- I was looking for this!
-  Isn't that so cool?
And then they also have the tower
and you, like, control the
little wizard inside the tower.
(happy music)
- We found the wizard wand!
- All right, we are back
home from a very busy morning
of breakfast, farmers'
market, and toy shopping.
So, I put on my comfy
shorts, (laughs) obviously.
But I thought I would do a
little farmers' market haul
for you guys, to show you guys
what we got from the farmers' market.
We love going to the farmers' market,
it's every Saturday where we live,
we usually make it, like,
every other Saturday.
So, this morning, I got some flowers,
I believe this is eucalyptus,
I got some of these flowers, which,
these are the coolest flowers ever,
because they last a really long time.
And this is what they look like.
Isn't that cool?
And then I got some hydrangeas.
We also got some fresh green beans,
which are giant, so I was like,
"Ooh, I gotta have these."
We got some little fruits and stuff,
this is mostly whilst walking around
the farmers' market, the kids
snacked on some strawberries.
- I also got this cute
little homemade dress
for June, it's six to 12 months,
and it actually has little fish on it,
maybe flowers, but
- I think it's like,
little beta fish.
- But they're so,
It's so cute.
- Yeah, it is cute.
I'm obsessed. And then we got,
a couple little succulents
for, just like, a small, what is it?
Like a...
- Planter we just bought.
- The planter that he bought.
- This one, I think is gonna
be like, the pearl one,
which I'll show you, I got
a big pearl plant there.
- That's pretty cool.
This is so cool. So, this
is just like, a cactus,
and then
- It's a starfish.
- It's a star flower.
- Yeah, so, this is the bloom
from the cactus that only happens,
- Isn't that crazy?
- It's very rare,
It's like once a year.
- And the way it, like,
folds and like, forms to what
it is on, it's so pretty.
-  Beautiful. I'm
gonna put it in a cool pot.
- Love it. And then this is
something we got for Kelsey.
If you guys didn't know,
it was Kelsey's birthday
the other day, and they're
gonna be here today,
so we're kind of celebrating it today,
but I really thought this was so cute
and it would go really good
with their new little house.
- Yeah, so this is like a
repurposed piece of wood
and then this is like,
an old tequila bottle.
- Is it tequila? Oh my
gosh, I didn't know that.
- Yeah! (laughs) She said
that a bunch of times.
It's an old tequila bottle,
she cut the top off of it,
planted these in it, and then
there's a moss plug down here
so that when they water
it, it'll drip out,
but it'll keep all the dirt in.
- So cool.
- Yeah.
- We thought they'd like
that for their new house.
And then what do we got
going on over here, babe?
- I am making Kelsey a homemade
chocolate ganache cake.
She loves chocolate cake, but
she likes really rich ganache.
- So Missy is doing all that
from scratch. No biggie.
Just baking a cake from scratch.
- I'm excited.
- And this is the final thing I got
from the farmers' market.
Check this out, you guys.
This is something pearls, let
me know in the comments below,
it's something pearls.
I'm sure I'll Google it
and know in like 10 minutes,
but this is, like, nine months
to a year growth, he said,
which is so cool, and
it was only 10 bucks!
So, I gotta find a cool place for this
and put it in, like, a cute little pot.
But I was excited to play
with all our new toys
when we got home, but someone decided
he had to take a nap, so he's sleeping.
All right, what do you guys
think? I put the pearls up there
on my little floating cabinet.
I think it looks good, and I never really
open this, so I don't think
it's gonna be a problem,
with all these things hanging down, but,
they look so cool! I love them.
- Dad, we gotta open the wizard wand!
- Yeah, dude! Let's do it!
- I just, hear something, but I don't know
I think it was this or the cave.
- It made some noise?
- Yeah.
- Ooh. We should see what's inside, huh?
Did you have a good nap?
- Yeah. We need to open this now.
- So we are opening up the wizard wand!
Whoa, look at that,
dude. That's cool, huh?
That was odd. So, funny
thing that I just saw,
it comes with a USB charger, Ollie.
We may have to charge it.
That is cool looking! Look
at that, dude. Feel it.
Is that a cool wand?
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's see if we have to charge it
or put batteries in it or something.
So this is our little spell book
of all the different
combinations you can do
to cast certain spells.
"Inside every wand lives a dragon so bold
with lessons to learn as
their stories unfold."
So, a dragon lives inside
of this wand, Ollie.
Yeah.
- That's so cool.
- We may have to charge it.
(Whimsical music)
- This is the tower.
- That's right. This is the tower,
and there's a wizard who
lives inside of it, right?
- And this comes off, and,
here, let me show you.
- Yeah, it comes off like that.
- Because he escapes.
- Yeah, so this guy's in this cage,
and you can just pull him out
and then he escapes. (laughs)
- Hey Ollie, let's show them
the wizard inside the castle.
Push this button.
-  'I ain't afraid of no dragons!'
-  It's like a little
TV show in the castle, huh?
- It is a TV show.
- So that's the wizard
that lives in there,
and you have a wand that has a dragon
that lives inside of it, and
you got to shoot him, huh?
- (Spooky music)
-  Uh oh! I think he just
switched on my mischief mode!
Don't say I didn't warn you!
- Ollie! I just pulled
your wand off the charger
and the dragon's in
there! Look, he's moving!
Look at him!
That's so cool!
- Yeah! He's moving!
- All right, you wanna turn it
on and see the dragon inside?
-  Good day, young wizard!
Let's cook up the magic!
- Whoa, that's so cool! That
dragon was talking to you, huh?
-  Just a ticket to adventure!
Are you with me, young wizard?
Flick your wand once for yes!
- Look, there's dinosaurs!
Hurry, wave your wand! Now run!
-  That worked all
in time! Just in time.
- That is so cool, huh? Shoot the wizard!
- (laughs) You disintegrated him!
This is seriously so
cool, this wand, like,
has a little screen, and then it, like,
has a screen up there too, and
you can see what's going on.
That is so cool. (laughs)
You like your new toy, Ollie?
- Yes!
- Okay, come give me a hug.
I'm really proud of you,
you are a really good boy, okay?
I want you to keep it up, okay?
- I just want to, fight with those guys.
- Yeah, you totally can. Wave your wand!
(lightning bolt)
Whoa, dude! You're a good wizard.
(orchestral music)
All right, the boys are helping
Missy put together a Exersaucer.
Ollie, are you gonna play in this?
- Nope.
- No, you're too big!
Finn, I mean...you're almost too big, huh?
Babe, why are you
building this Exersaucer?
We don't have any babies.
- Uh, for June!
-  Oh hey! And
Paris, what's up buddy?
-  We made it.
-  Look at that!
- You guys, they're Californians now.
-  I know!
-  You guys live in California.
- Well, it depends on
tomorrow. We'll get our house.
-  So Missy's been
putting this together all day
for June and I'm like,
why are you doing that?
That's so, like, a
newborn dad thing to do.
(group laughs)
I've had to put together,
like 10 of these things, okay?
I did my dues.
- I was giving her pointers because I just
put one together a couple weeks ago.
-  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hi, June! She is getting
excited, it seems like.
She's staring at it.
- She is so excited.
- You wanna jump?
And I don't know if you guys have ever
seen Paris on our channel!
He's their little puppy dog.
Hi Paris! He's so cool. He's so friendly
and fluffy and clean. I like it.
All right, we have the
ship, we just need a pilot!
Whoo! Finn's like, "Uh, this was mine."
This is for June, Finn. (group laughs)
-  Look at that!
-  There's so many things to try!
- Lego time! He's so excited.
- Yes, Lego ninja.
- He's actually called The Fire
Mech. Can you say Fire Mech?
- Fire Mech.
- Yeah! Good job, dude. So,
Ollie is eating his dinner,
and I found this bad
boy at Toys'R'Us today,
and I was like, "You know,
I'm gonna get me a toy,
I want to put together a Lego set,
because I've been wanting to for a while,
so I grabbed this. I'm so
excited to see this movie."
- This one is a bad guy!
- He's a bad guy?
- Yeah!
- How do you know that?
- Because!
- He just knows everything.
- He's a bad guy, he's a bad guy.
- Well, Mama is usually the pro at this.
You're probably not gonna see
the end result tonight, okay?
- I don't know how to do
this, but you can do this!
- Well, I can?
- Yeah.
- Well, thank you for
giving me permission.
You're so silly.
(Ollie blows raspberry)
(Bryan blows raspberry back)
- I'm not. I'm not silly.
- Yeah, you are!
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are!
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are!
- No, I'm not.
- I know you are, but what am I?
- Silly!
(inspirational music)
- All right, it's this guy's bedtime, huh?
It is a little bit early for him,
but he has been, like,
not in the best mood
kind of all day, so I was like,
maybe he should go to bed.
But anyways, we are so excited
that Kelsey and Corbin are here.
We haven't really talked a ton about it,
but I cannot even tell you guys
how much of a dream come
true this is for us.
We've always been friends,
like, since high school,
and we have so much history together
and it's really, really cool.
I used to tell people, "Yeah, our friends
live in Oregon," and they'd be like,
"Oh, well, are they ever gonna move here?"
I'd be like, "No. Nope, they never are."
But, you know, things change, and
you have a baby, and you're like, "Wait!"
You know, they have family out here,
that live in the same general area,
and we're out here, and it's just like,
it's so awesome that now we
get to raise our kids together.
Although, I have always said this:
you never know how long Kelsey
and Corbin are gonna stay.
They are wanderers to the core,
hence their name, "Steps to Wander."
I expect them to, I
mean, I hope they don't,
but I'm sure, one day, they might
want to try out another
part of the country,
or something, I'm sure they'll
still do lots of traveling,
but, I'm just so excited,
like, this is so fun,
I'm gonna have my best friend here,
and we're gonna get to do things together,
and have our kids together,
and it's just gonna be so cool.
The boys are gonna grow up with June,
and she's gonna be like
a little sister to them.
They're just gonna, like,
probably annoy her (laughs)
and probably protect her, so,
just really, really exciting,
and it's just like day one of
a really exciting new adventure.
So, make sure you guys
go subscribe to them
because they are gonna be
very much in our life a lot,
and you'll wanna know
what's going on over there,
plus, they'll be blogging a bunch
over there, too, of our family.
So, anyways, we're super excited.
I actually made a cake,
so we're gonna actually
eat that a little bit later, but for now
it's time for your bedtime, okay?
Say night night!
- Night, night.
-  Late night video games.
We broke out the Nintendo
Switch, and Corbin...
- You're stressing me out.
-  Here we go! Here we go!
- Missy's still obsessed
with Overcooked, you guys.
And this one is still awake.
You hanging out with us?
Can you end our vlog?
-  All right guys,
thumbs up if you like this video,
we're gonna see you
mañana, if you liked it,
be sure to subscribe! Bye!
