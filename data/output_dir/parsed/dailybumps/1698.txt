leave a comment below with your guys
favorite band because I want to know if
like maybe you listened to something
that I don't and maybe
I like missing out on something you know
I mean good morning everyone as you can
see I have not done my hair today
um I mean I just I don't really like my
hair curly I don't think it looks bad or
anything I just don't prefer it it feels
very like but and I can put stuff in it
but even when I like try and calm it
down it just I just don't like it I like
straight hair for me but it is crazy
though because those curls are just
insane just the craziest thing I don't
know where I get these curls I'm going
to be getting the room together on karma
pot of stuff cough diapers um which I
started doing yesterday and it was a lot
of fun I was like this is so much fun I
actually got a little stat going of all
my newborn sizes here's my one sizes and
then I still got it my hospital bag
together so I can do it hustle down
video so hopefully that'll be up soon I
didn't want to say some of you guys are
so cool about the ad playing like yeah
we made a couple ads and it's actually
so cool because it's YouTube obviously
there's gonna be ads right but instead
of seeing some stupid ad like with
people you don't know you see a cool ad
