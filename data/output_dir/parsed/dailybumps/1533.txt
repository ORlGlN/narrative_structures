you guys I couldn't take it I just I had
to I just had to leave I just left the
house I was so mad at Missy and I was
like you know what forget you on leaving
I'm outta here no that's not what
happened
actually I'm just gonna go run a couple
errands there's some things I didn't
want to leave the house today I we've
been really really busy today I've been
filming like crazy because I want videos
to be done on my channel soon so
hopefully that'll work and as you can
see it's dark out and it is 5:30 in the
afternoon it's 5:30 in the afternoon
Lord is it dark I really don't like this
part of winter I love like that it's
colder 57 degrees for those who are
keeping track don't like it's dark hey
guys um I just got done filming my
casual Friday video I just came down
here Cassie is actually watching Olly
and listening to music apparently you
guys listening to American Pie it's so
funny
this looks pretty cute on you you kind
of look like a mom thank you say I'm the
auntie auntie she told me that she would
watch him but that I have to teach her
to teach him to say auntie before mommy
so I don't know about that I know I'm
probably gonna get a lot of flack for
vlogging right now while driving the
wallet Starks a lot of people are
yelling at me in the comments yesterday
why you gotta yell at me you guys but
really I didn't want to say a lot of
people are always like don't vlog and
drive that's so dangerous and to be
honest it's not dangerous at all
because I normally drive with one hand
on the wheel anyway and I
looking at the road I rarely look at the
camera
so I'm actually paying attention the
road it's not like texting and driving
or like when you're on the phone and
driving or anything like that
so didn't want to say for those of you
who think that it's like a horrible
thing and it's super unsafe go try it
get in your car and hold out a camera
just start talking to it you know and
you'll see that it's totally fun to do
and maybe you'll get maybe you guys will
make a good youtube channel out of it
and then you could put a YouTube channel
up and then when you put videos up of
your driving while vlogging I can yell
at you oh it's not ho ho ho ho it's just
hopeful hope that's how he does it on a
Christmas story yeah ho ho Merry
Christmas
I submit something that I've never
watched that movie watch where he goes
up there and then meet Santa like kicks
him down the slide
I've watched pieces of it I don't enjoy
it oh my goodness
these are all of the presents that I am
ordered and received did you go through
them although there's some presents that
you got me thank you so much I'm really
excited
seriously every Christmas since I stuff
for him from me okay Missy I can't okay
here's the thing I can't just give
missing my login to my eBay because then
she'd see all the cool stuff I ordered
her and she can't just like make up
another eBay login and go in and spend
all my money cuz that'll be like hey
would you spend two hundred and fifty
dollars on that's how much a ps3 cost
bTW and we can buy some view of history
I know alright Missy's getting festive
try again I can't leave the house in
disaster again mmm-hmm hey Missy I must
ask you a question deck a little is that
daddy's letter yes you're dull here why
are you so bootiful I got a package from
my sister today and so I'm gonna attempt
to open it I got really excited I was
like oh sweet a new TV mount but it's
just a recycle box
mm-hmm
I don't know how she packaged this thing
but it's like really really in there
okay okay so my sister is obsessed with
Keurig she has a Keurig also and she is
obsessed she collects K Cups out the
wazoo
i facetimed her the other day and they
were everywhere so she sent us a package
cuz she heard that we got the carry
Keurig and so she she look she even gave
us instructions on how to use some of
these because some of them are ice tea
and some of them are cappuccino
she says snuggle baby Olie for her so
you need to get on that look at this Wow
this is all out of her collection and
she it literally didn't even make a dent
in her collection she loves the Keurig
and so she just gets every every time
she sees one that she likes she gets one
okay I'm Tom Chris blend you can
actually look at Karma like this isn't
for you buddy no what you do is you pour
this in first and then you brew the
coffee over and it makes sort of like a
cappuccino so I'm gonna try that it's
like it was expresso all right so I'm
gonna do this cappuccino wine it's
supposed to get all frothy and nummy
pour the broth packet in just like that

cappuccino and you put it right over it
