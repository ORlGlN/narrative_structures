you're wondering why ollie is standing
in a restaurant with no turn on
good wedding guy Missy what are you
doing are you actually filming a video
I'm gonna actually do it what I took
last week off because I was sick I was
um extremely busy with holiday season
stuff and I just needed a break I was
kind of feeling actually a bit burnt out
and if that happens sometimes as
youtubers yeah it does actually on the
daily vlogger I'm just gonna admit it
your life is involved you know has to do
with the camera all day long
sometimes doing these videos can be a
little bit daunting but I'm really
excited I'm back this week and I've got
a special video and it should be up
Wednesday so I'm really excited about
this one yeah yeah and we got it all set
up we kinda are doing something new with
the camera so she feels a little bit
more confident and you have a little bit
more control cop I'm still having um
yeah I don't really excited about having
a screen here I do feel more confident
because I can see myself I can see what
I look like I don't can be like dang I
look at this videos gonna be a good one
like I know for sure there's no hair
sticking up so I have no idea and that
affects what you say as you say it so
this is totally like you're filming room
not I don't know if anyone's really seen
Cassie gave us this really cool picture
to hang them on the bed we have these
cool little like French lights around
the board and I Missy really wants to
get like a desk here or maybe like a
vanity would be nice because then you
can film in front of that too you'll
have two locations to film in one room
so it's quite cool as I've never had one
I've always wanted one number two this
room gets amazing lighting yeah I could
do why we film in here do my makeup in
the same lighting that I'm going to film
my videos that sir it's like awesome
very cool so I think I am definitely
gonna be doing that soon cool well you

hey guys it's Cassie and I'm here with
Missy
driving she's not walking because I
don't wouldn't want to die so we're
going Christmas shopping because we
haven't really done anything this year
because whenever I good at time
management and we have oli which you
can't see them then I was mirror and
we're not there somewhere yeah so we're
going to go Christmas shopping this week
like fun yeah we're going to crap get
stuff for Brian which I never can do
because Brian is always with me so I
pretty much just ditched Brian and me
Cassie was humming for him it would
probably my go shopping for my mom and
dad to a little bit may main focus is
Brian I'm always with Brian if I'm with
I'm not with Brian or if I'm with Brian
and I can do like everyone else so I'm
gonna try and shop for everyone because
I haven't got anything oh my god I got
something for Oliver
oh yeah that's about it you got to tell
him one of those right now now it is she
pretty good she wants me to find out on
Christmas morning yeah it's me really
cool all right so yeah I almost made my
sister go all the way back to the car to
get my camera cuz I thought I didn't
bring it but luckily I had yet because I
am a good vlogger and I am good at
remembering where the camera is not
really so we've actually gotten a lot of
Christmas shopping done I can't believe
like I said take you with me because
Brian's gonna edit this and then he'll
see where I've been we're actually at
the mall now that's a very broad place
you have no idea what I could be getting
at the mall so we're gonna do more
shopping at the mall always being good I
for some reason have a stroller now that
doesn't contain my child so get this you
guys he get out of the stroller super
easy he just slips his arms right out of
the straps and then stands right up it's
so frustrating so I don't know what I'm
gonna do because I can't I can't like
not have a stroller it's I don't know so
if you guys know any like hacks to like
keep your kid into a stroller that can
get out of it he's helped me out because
obviously most of the time like a car
seat has like a chest strap I don't want
to put chest clip on him but I think I'm
gonna have to do I'm about ready to tape
it down look
he did pretty good while we were
shopping but as you can see he's already
li overed both of his little arms sort
of strap so that's kind of annoying but
he was good
they're going to take some pictures on
this thing in the picture here we are
you smile
look it okay now he's got to go like
this oh okay this lighting it makes me
look terrible
okay now what okay no we decided to go
ahead and grab some all garden for his
handsome breadstick going in yeah all we
need is breadsticks that makes the world
bridge mountainous yeah that's how Fredo
sauce yeah may I were just feel relaxed
and then we're gonna head home
we're wondering like standing in a
restaurant with my turn on because she
like started choking and throughout
everything and then wipe them all up and
take out this circle so everything's
being packed up right now now he doesn't
have a shirt on and kind of just a hot
you're hot mess baby he's just chewing
on this one taste for like ever and I
was watching him and then all of a
sudden he was like nope this isn't going
to work and you just okay yeah yeah and
I caught it in my hand we've like
completely lost this whole like relaxing
and having something to eat for dinner
did not work like we pretty much did it
eat anything because we're feeling very
nauseous or having everything but like
packed up and we're leaving the second
he has no servants more food groups kind
of embarrassing but don't judge me it
was kind of a disaster
all right baby is all clean he had a
nice bath and now we're getting ready
for bed and he's acting like a nut
you're acting like a nut my love yeah
yeah I can be like it crazy she's been
running around this room
butt-naked for the past like ten minutes
and I finally I couldn't vlog him
obviously because he's naked so I put a
diaper on him things have calmed down a
bit I think that without a diaper you
just feel so free like you could just
run anywhere and do anything you want
huh she loves getting on this thing here
we go we're gonna
we gotta calm down you're crazy
yeah all right I'm gonna get this kid to
bed oh hey guys how's it going
I am home Missy is actually asleep and
all he is asleep and I feel like they
had a really really productive day and I
was actually able to get a lot of stuff
done while they were running around
doing some Christmas shopping and stuff
I wanted to tell you about something
that just happened to me
that I'm quite bummed about this yeah
can you guys see
guys see it is cracked it's also 1:30 in
the morning in case you're wondering
seriously look at that that is nuts I
feel like it's getting worse - how
ridiculous is that are you kidding me
okay you guys want to hear what happened
because it's a pretty good story my
switch right here my silent switch isn't
working it it wasn't working before I
dropped it okay
and it was like messing up and so I took
my case off the only time I've ever had
this phone without a case okay I'm
actually sitting on the toilet obviously
and so I take my case off and I check
the switch I'm like oh no it's still
broken
and make a mental note to make a Genius
Bar appointment so they can I can take
it in and they'll fix it because I'm
sure that they can fix it since I didn't
have anything to do with doing that and
then the phone seriously slips out of my
hand
granted I'm sitting on the toilet and
there is a soft mat below me the phone
slips out of my hand like this and falls
just like that onto the soft mat and I
pick it up and it's shattered what the
even heck you guys how does that happen
it barely even felt like I can feel
these cracks with my fingers like that's
not safe I don't know what to do
are you kidding me are you kidding me
right now this is actually happening I
feel like every time I've ever dropped
any of my old iPhones I've always picked
them up with that horror of like going
like this and they've never been cracked
at night I literally felt like I was in
a dream when I picked it up and it's
like all crack I found my you goo that
I'm not no I'm gonna go ahead and end
