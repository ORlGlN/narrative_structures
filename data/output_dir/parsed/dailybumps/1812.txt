today's big day guys we are just putting
the final touches and I crawling out of
bed here sorry about the mess
doing laundry seems like we're always
doing laundry but um only want to share
something really cool these are jeans
that I cut into shorts like maybe like
two or three years ago but they're
actually jeans that are smaller than I
normally wear and I actually have room
normally I can never even fit into these
and I actually fit into them so that's
really cool I just realized I do this
all the time I shave at my desk if you
guys shaving weird spots maybe like in a
living her at home water maybe at your
desk or in bed or in the car
I actually just wish I could grow my
beard one I wish I worked at a place
that allowed me to do it and - I wish I
was just physically able to grow a beard
hey guys so we are once again getting
ready for the party
this has been like a three day getting
ready kind of party but um you know just
kind of turn to take it easy so that
once the final day comes which is today
it's not so like crazy so I think we've
we've done pretty good just doing the
last-minute cleanup and preparing and
getting ready to go get right cake which
I cannot wait to see I'm so excited for
my cake yeah I think it's gonna be such
an awesome day and I'm so excited why
this day let it go

it Missy gave me a whole list of things
to do before the party today so I'm
ready to do that but first she needs
breakfast so I'm going to our favorite
bagel place to grab her a bagel and some
cream cheese I'm really hoping that I
don't run out of gas because it's saying
it's empty so I'm not good I actually
got you breakfast a bagel from the bagel
place I don't pay right and then I got
your lunch cuz I know you're gonna want
lunch in like 30 minutes
Missy put me on questionmark duty to put
all around the house and I kind of went
a little crazy got that one that one
then I made a karma one we're just an
evil dog in general I don't know why his
eyes the red button and then I did a
ballerina one and a stripy one and then
I was listening to Justin Timberlake so
I did Justin Timberlake one so he's got
a suit and tie boom karma wanted to be
involved in the team blue and team pink
contest so he is wearing both necklaces
that way
he doesn't give off any clues as to what
his baby brother or sister really is I'm
puppy okay so I am all done decorating
so this is basically what it looks like
here's our living room area I still
haven't got my cake so we'll show you
that later but I have all the little
Hershey's with the he-she decorate or
colored and then I've got my little
clothespin line this girl and boy

decorations over here but a big huge I
got those things for a dollar I don't
they were gonna be like these little
squares is huge like from ceiling to
floor huge and then we've got streamers
got all these O'Brien I put him on the
mission of making question marks
everywhere and he went kind of crazy so
oh it did here enjoy oh yeah but his
karma won and he's got some cool little
ones and then my favorite my favorites
are the suit and tie and the ballerina
it's Justin Timberlake okay Bobby Young
my entire ever but okay and then Brian
got a little bit crazy with the
streamers he gets a little excited
sometimes so he put an x over here
whatever that hurt and then he put this
one right here just very random I don't
know it just accentuates the room so I
am on my way to go pick up the cake I'm
so excited to see that I cannot wait oh

people come in they are gonna write
their team so it says right here blue or

what everyone else saw online stuff
it's a boy we did yeah we're pretty sure
it's a boy so far your little one has
been a pleasure to carry little or no
fuss and only a few diaper changes which
is difficult to do with a beak I might
add just a friendly reminder that I will
be accepting gratuity upon my riding
mower in the form of frogs fighting fish
earthworms or any other small mammals oh
and one more kitty your bundle of joy is
in fact a beautiful baby boy
congratulations we just got silly string
it really stinks little is it on me it

little article saying that stork mail
general video is the best we've seen so
that's so cool like oh I'm stoked oh my
god did you make that that's so cool
I can't wait to do pictures and I do
plan the cloth diaper so these will work
thank you this is Tina by the way she's
a family friend and she runs an Etsy
shop where she knits Oh crochet I'll put
it in the description so people can see
it but that's so cool thank you thank
you guys
fine can't make girls it was the party
turned out awesome the balloons were
perfect yeah you guys will see it if you
guys watch our video or you think then
you'll see it it was like amazing like
everywhere we miss you guys you wish you
were here for the party
look at my shoes guys it's from all the
confetti and still the string that I
spray did everyone and then other people
attacked me with but for me no one
else's shoes look like that that's weird
alright guys so we are very exhausted it
was just a really long day yeah party
went really great reveal went really
great it feels real
to say that we are having a boy a baby
boy and we can tell you guys they don't
like keep it a secret any longer Missy
was feeling horrible about it this
gender reveal video
it's like going cray cray right now the
thing is that it's not just an awesome
video an awesome way to like reveal it
it has so much meaning behind it because
it's isn't like reflects you know our
journey and the things that we've been
through and I don't know it just in it
like came from the heart and it's just a
really really fun and and sweet video
that is just no it's just really special
it's not just a fun way to announce it
it means something yeah I think like
with everything we've been through it's
just a really cool way to sort of like
celebrate it because finding out the
gender is such like a big part of the
pregnancy it's like a milestone and
getting to that milestone with this
pregnancy is just really cool and
obviously like you can see our passion
in the video just by watching it because
we put a lot into it and a lot of
thought behind it before we even started
filming I will say like it's insane or
now it was up at 3 that was five hours
ago and so we're at 206 comments and
almost 300 likes
that's insane we're almost at 300 likes
like I don't think we've had any video
do that before that's are so cool like
everyone is loving it just as much as we
do and so it feels good to finally say
we're having a boy we'll probably talk
about it a little bit more in tomorrow's
vlog sort of about the confusions and
all that I have a ton of pictures from
the party that will probably upload to
Missy's Facebook page for her vlog the
bumps along the way so I'll put a link
in the description so you guys can see
pictures thanks for watching guys I hope
you guys enjoyed the vlog and I'll see
you guys
