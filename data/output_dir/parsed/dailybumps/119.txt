-  Fin keeps grabbing the suckers.
- You already had one, no more suckers.
-  No more suckers buddy.
-  Okay?
-  There's a whole
jar of them though Mother.
-  I know.
-  Oh look, he's
going back inside the house.
And then he's back at it.
(laughs)
Fin.
Fin I really really
appreciate your determination,
but you already had a sucker today.
He's opening.
Let me try it.
No Fin!

-  Good morning lalala.
- What is that sound?
- Fin.
- That Fin?
- Yeah.
- Good morning guys.
We've had kind of a fun morning.
We basically just got up and got ready,
are we're getting ready to go to
- CJ and Bailey's house!
- Nope breakfast.
(laughs)
Gotta go to breakfast first.
Yeah we have a super fun day planned.
We have to eat first, and Momma
is getting a little hungry,
and it's possible so is Fin.
Let's go see what he's doing.
He's making a lot of noise in here.
Finley J, what's going on in here.
We can't eat chocolate for breakfast bud.
Finley do not pull a
terrible two on me, okay?
Hey bud, what if we go get breakfast
like pancakes and waffles,
- I want waffles!
- Does that sound good to you?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
And eggs, whoa whoa.
Alright, well we're gonna
save this for later, K?
Hopefully a meltdown doesn't go down.
Anyways the house is
kind of a mess right now.
Oh my goodness, everyone
is kicking around things,
but I will say Luna is doing good.
I feel like a lot of people
have been worried about her.
She's doing really good.
She's taking her medicine.
Uh oh come here.
Come here.
She's taking her medicine,
and she's in her crate right now resting
because we're getting ready to leave
and I don't want to leave her out.
What?
Is that her medicine?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Alright boys let's go get in the car.
Daddy's finishing up a
couple of things for work
even though it's Saturday,
but he's never done working.
So he's gonna finish a couple of things
while I put the kids in the car,
and then it's time to go and
have a fun day not working.
- Ollie is choosing a toy
because we are headed to breakfast,
and he has a bag full of toys
and I said you can bring one.
Oh you're bringing your firetruck?
- Yeah cause I'm gonna call this a gun.
- Oh okay, but it's a ladder.
- I know. I'm just gonna call it a gun.
- Oh okay.
(laughs)
We are at Richie's dinner,
and we were gonna grab
some breakfast, but we have
about a 10 minute wait,
and Fin fell asleep on the ride over.
So he is getting a little 10 minute nap.
It's the triumphs in
parenting, the little triumphs
in parenting that you celebrate.
(funky music)
(sirens wailing)
Whoa.
It makes some cool noises huh?
- Yeah look at this part.
(honking)
Oh yeah. Look at this chocolate milk.
We're cheers-ing.
Cheers!
Happy Saturday guys.
How is it?
Definitely thumbs up for a chocolate milk.
I was definitely feeling
chocolate milk this morning.
Hey where are we going to today Ollie?
- Um CJ and Bailey's birthday!
- He's so excited for CJ and Bailey's.
Although, in reality,
it's just CJ's birthday,
but they're like together.
(funky upbeat music)
Nice balancing skills dude.
- It's on the firetruck.
- I know it's so cool.
(music continues)
- We're at CJ's birthday party!
-  Yeah!
- Hi.
-  Hi Bailey!
(laughs)
Where's the birthday boy?
Alright so Fin keeps grabbing the suckers.
- You already had one.
No more suckers.
-  No more suckers buddy.
-  Okay?
-  There's a whole
jar of them though Mother.
- Oh look, he's going
back inside the house.
And then he's back at it.
(laughs)
Fin.
Fin I really really
appreciate your determination,
but you already had a sucker today.
He's opening.
K that one's Daddy's, okay?
Let me try it.
No Fin!
You already had one.
Do you see him?
Do you see what he's doing guys?
Finley J, no more suckers.
(laughs)
Oh my goodness.
- Happy birthday CJ.
-  Happy birthday CJ.
Should we show him his present Ollie?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, you want to show him?
-  Tell him what you got?
- We got a trampoline!
-  You get a trampoline
for your new backyard!
Are you so excited?
-  You can jump on the boxes.
That's it, just the boxes.
-  Yeah this is
actually a trampoline.
Go jump go jump.
You can practice on that.
(cheers)
-  You got your dad a job to do.
-  All you gotta
do is put it together CJ.
- What?
- And that's from all of
the Hollister Lannings.
-  That's from all of us.
Happy birthday dude.
Jump Fin jump.
Fin's like oh this is cool.
(upbeat music)
Check out this amazing
Greenbay Packer cake
for CJ's ninth birthday.
That is amazing.
- Yes it is.
-  Yes.
♪ Happy birthday to you CJ ♪
♪ Happy birthday dear CJ ♪
Ye ye!
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪
(cheering)
Happy birthday buddy.
CJ really wants to smash
this cake in his face
so we have to film it.
You ready?
Go!
(laughing)
That's not that bad.
Oh!
-  Hey CJ, now you gotta get him.
- CJ is living his best life right now.
Look at that.
Alright we are driving home
from CJ's birthday party,
but we had so much fun didn't we Ollie?
- Yeah!
- Yes I am so excited that
CJ now has a big trampoline
all for himself.
Well he probably has to share with Bailey
and his friends and
stuff, but I'm so excited
because they actually just
moved so they have a new house,
and they have a backyard,
and they're able to put
a trampoline in it now,
and I think the kids are gonna love it.
-  So exciting.
- Yeah so happy birthday CJ.
We had a blast hanging out with you,
and now we are headed home.
- How is the trampoline going to fit?
- It's not as big, their
backyard is big enough for it.
It should fit pretty easy.
- Maybe we'll go there in a few weeks,
and we can go jump on it.
-  Yeah you wanna
go jump at their house?
- Yeah.
-  That be fun Fin?
- Yeah.
- Just picked up some
food from the taco shop
because we've been craving
carne asada all day.
So we're heading home to go eat dinner.
Put these kids to B-E-D.
Always like does he know
how to spell that yet?
(upbeat dance music)
