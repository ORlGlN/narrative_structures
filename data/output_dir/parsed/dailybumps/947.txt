guys I hope you guys are doing awesome
we've already had a pretty busy morning
and I think all of us about the week
implement snap so apparently he's been
doing this thing he's already
mommy wants dude he's doing well he
climbed out of his crib today for the
first time he wasn't mad he just saw
something that he really wanted that was
outside of the crib and so he basically
climbed out to go get it and then he
knocked on the door to tell me that he
was outside of his crib so anyway I put
him back to bed and he went right to
sleep yeah I think it's time that mrs.
gonna have to look into the twin bed
sooner than she was hoping but obviously
if he's gonna be climbing out so anyway
he's about to wake up I thought well
maybe I could catch it on film for Missy
and Brian instead of not here maybe
we'll catch it see what happens
he might do it he might not we'll see so
we're gonna go set up the camera right
now and hopefully we can catch it spread
one for all you guys to see good morning
guys look there's Brian and the ocean we
woke up this morning and totally just
chilled in the room until we had our in
room massages we just had like awesome
massages my hips were killing me so
badly plus whenever you like go
snorkeling it kind of does like use
muscles use muscles definitely you're
like Henson so we both got a really nice
massage and it was really wonderful and
my hips feel so much better where she's
driving now I gotta hop this fence it's
sprinkling here it is just a little
actually rained and stormed last night
almost like a mist it feels really nice
they have the best french fries ever
here you guys they're like seasoned and
yummy and crispy
but yeah Missy and I are both eating
chicken strips yes yeah sometimes you
just need a little slice at home and
comfort and they have really good
chicken strips here too which I'm pretty
sure on the kids menu
hashtag no shame
well that didn't take long
that was like within 30 seconds of me me
putting the gun out of the thing what
are you doing you crazy kid yeah we're
definitely getting him a twin bed sooner
than we thought huh buddy so we are
getting ready to maybe head into town
and have some fun exploring the city but
I we show this to you guys but when
we've logged it it was nighttime and now
it's daytime so you can see it in all
its beauty this is a old run-down sugar
mill it's pretty cool yeah it probably
crushed like the sugar canes so sugar
cane actually used to be a really big
export for this place but not really so
much anymore there's really only one
place you can get it and they do like
make the sugar cane juice out of it so
now that they don't really do a whole
lot of sugar cane they have a lot of
these sugar mills yeah we saw like two
coming in on the boat yeah it is pretty
cool Oh conch shell do you know how to
do it I try No
so I'm gonna think we're dying in here
it is very hot today I get this boy you
look like it go to be good it looks like
a ghost because I put sunscreen on his
face yeah okay can you see that it's
like a hundred and 843 Celsius we're
gonna go in here for a little while I
just thought maybe we should take
advantage of the full time so we're
gonna go do that wait for aunty I think
Kota wants to go now too
is it cold
what if you take the gun and he jumps to
it there you go
he always wants to play with the water
gun but we never fill it up with water
unless we're outside or in the pool yeah
once you'd begun
trying to get you yeah we are in
downtown st. Croix walking toward the
boardwalk we're just gonna explore a
little and then I think I'm dinner down
here later but this is the boardwalk
here yeah
the marina the tsunami hazard zone in
case of earthquake go to higher ground
because they have an earthquake and then
a huge wave comes and crash the city
it's a cool little marina though there's
lots of chickens and cats running around
it's pretty cool oh hey that was our
boat and that's our crew hey Rudy those
are real giant fish holy crap he's like
this big yeah that is crazy
one thing you guys may not know about
st. Croix that we've learned after we
were here apparently it has the highest
murder rate we've been told it's like
locals-only
and it's because it's such a small area
so we definitely have to keep our wits
about us yeah yeah be like really
cautious and they're like kind of
hesitant a little hesitant about it we
have everything here something to keep
but I think that's pretty much the end
of the boardwalk we can go this right
now something we do at every single
place we visit is we get a magnet for
our fridge nope always gotten one so we
got to get one I like the one with the
Turtles yeah where the puck island one I
do like the buck I don't like is we
really meant it's just a picture that's
not boring
this is like a little shopping place we
just went through look at it though it's
so cool-looking it's like a weathered
Macy found a dog that is an adorable dog
we had to get a crucian hook these are
actually pretty interesting this one's
got this really cool gem in it
and it's like the gem of the Caribbean
apparently this gem is only found in
like the Caribbean and Lauren there I
think it's a Laura okay they said that
it could increase value over time as
they start to realize that it will
actually is not found anywhere else
oh it's interesting so they say
Christians like I've been seeing a lot
of people wear them out here and I was
like what is and I finally found out
it's just kind of like a symbol of like
loving the island yeah and it has a
horseshoe for good luck and then
depending on which way you wear it means
whether you're taking or not so when the
horseshoe is towards you it means that
you're taken and if it's away from you
it means that you're looking for love
Missy is not looking for love love Ryan
had to put it on me that's part of the
ritual
yeah and it's called chicka-chicka
ticket now I'm just chilling they don't
like you chickens gosh there is an egg
it's just an egg
think there's anything in it
by moe he's like what I lack in legs I
make up for in love
we're at this place called Rum Runners
grabbing dinner and we're right by the
water so all these little crabs keep
coming up they're cute
oh that is a little one
that's so funny like this big yeah it's
probably on the menu too
just fed the crab a little keeping my
lobster and we won't be going it's kind
of weird but look at him
he has no idea he's eating his cousin
lobster all right here's another little
