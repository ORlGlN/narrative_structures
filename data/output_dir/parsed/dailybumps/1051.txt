doing all kinds of he's doing really
good he did all his kicks and slowed on
his back and he went underwater to get
toys which i think is really cool and he
was like monkey crawling along the pool

birth father I have things that I can
check because like before like when I
was a little kid I used to go to the
doctors and I never knew like what to
check for my father neither did my mom

was right not to do that is really true
I remember when even like when we were
filling out paperwork for all of her

here I'm like because I haven't been to
the doctor and forever I feel like I'm
gonna die and no one's gonna know why
are you ordered him a bunch of blood
ties and the last time I had blood drawn
I passed out in high school and I made
him do I made him donate blood when I
but he literally passed out and all I
know is I went to the friggin doctor now
he wants to take my blood stupid vampire
everything and make sure that I'm
healthy just good I got one kid and it
