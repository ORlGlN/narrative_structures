And once it is up I'll actually put a link
in the description block,
and in tomorrow's vlog
I'll remind you guys too.
But, we're so excited for you all
to hear our new family song.
Missy to the rescue.
Yes, that is right, I
have still not finished
this Lego Mack.
And Ollie every single night is like,
dada can you finish this tonight?
He wants to wake up and play with it.
- I know.
- I feel so bad, look
how much I did though.
- Yeah, that's pretty good.
- It just needs legs.
- Finish it up for ya.
- Missy is a Lego pro.
This is that cool Fire Mack
from the new Ninjago movie.
Kinda got a theme going on today because
we are surprising the boys
and we are taking them
to an early screening
of the Lego Ninjago movie,
and I am so excited to see it
because I love Lego movies
and Ollie loves Ninjago,
he literally told me today
he wants to be Ninjago for Halloween.
- I know, he loves
Ninjago and he loves Legos
so like, perfect thing.
- I think they're gonna love it.
But I thought we could finish this
and not take it there 'cause
he will destroy it probably.
- Yeah.
- Maybe we should glue it all together.
- I know, I feel bad 'cause he's actually
not the one that usually breaks it.
- Breaks them.
- It's usually Finn.
- Yeah, that's true.
Finn does not have patience.
By the way we're hanging out in our office
and we're watching them on the Nest Cam
in the playroom 'cause they are playing.
Sometimes technology makes parenting easy.
Easier.
- Finn's sleeping.
-  He is?
- Yeah.
- Look at this cuteness right now.
He fell asleep in his new
beanie bag, it's so precious.
- It's so cute.
- He is cute, huh?
- Yeah.
What are you doing, are you scheming?
Don't mess with him.
You're such a good big brother.
- That was a kiss.
Going to Ninjago!
- Yay, we're in the car headed out
to go see the new Ninjago movie
and we are so excited, huh?
- Let's do this.
(upbeat music)
-  Hey Ollie.
He isn't really sleeping,
I'm trying to wake him up right now.
Hey Ollie, you wanna see Ninjago?
Yeah.
- A Lego knight!
-  Yeah dude!
Look at this guy.
- I see that dragon right there.
-  This is a dragon
tail, looks like he busted
through the whole building.
Come look dude!
Oh my gosh he's looking at you!
- He looks like a baby one.
-  He's a baby dragon?
Ollie is not scared at all.
Wassup Lego knight dude?
We just checked in at Legoland,
