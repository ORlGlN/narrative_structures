oh nice
okay good morning guys we are out of the
house it's actually me my mom and we are
headed to Finn's first appointment this
is his first doctor's appointment and
Brian actually was going to go but we
thought he might want to stay back with
all ages because he's been having a
little bit of trouble with sleep and all
that my mom has helped me out cuz I
actually not technically supposed to be
driving and I can't carry this thing I
think cuz I'm like my c-section and
stuff I can't really lift more than 10
pounds hopefully everything goes through
at this appointment and we can gather
your break quickly look at him yeah a
little outfit on and
Enki and he is being so worried about
the car ride because when we put him in
there he doesn't like it but he always
falls right in sleep and he does great
so I love this little covered Ella got
me this - she has one - and it's so nice
works as a nursing cover - that's cool
no way I'm I'm very interested he left
the hospital at eight and a half pounds
oh wow
diapers not on yeah he left the hospital
at eight and a half pounds so we'll see
how much he's gained or lost I guess
they can tease well she just did all
kinds of pokin and proddin at you huh
alright we're done with our appointment
and everything looked good his weight
looks good and everything so we are
headed out good morning guys I am up

Oliver he got out of his bed slept with
us for a little bit and then it was just
like not working he had to go back to
his bed he would not let me walk away so
I had to lay with him and man I just got
I kept getting up and he kept getting
out of his bed I kept going back into
his bed
