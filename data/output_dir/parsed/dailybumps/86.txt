-  Good morning Finn!
- Ow, ow, ow!
-  What are you doin'?
- Oh, ow!
-  Did you throw
your toys down there?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, did he throw
your toys down there Ollie?
- No, I have my toys right here.
-  He keeps his
toys extra protected.
Finn just throws them down there.
So, that's where his toys are.
- Good morning guys!
- Morning!
- Good morning guys, we are
up at our cabin in Idlewild,
and we are so happy Luna's happy.
And we are enjoying this beautiful view,
and beautiful morning!
We've got bluebirds flyin' around.
My dad set up this
little trap for the boys,
so they could try and
catch a bluebird, huh?
Haven't caught one yet though, huh?
Takes patience, huh?
Do you have patience Ollie?
-  I see a black bird!
- There's a bluebird!
-  Hey, come back here!
- Come here, come here bluebird!
But yeah, it is a beautiful day.
We are wearing sweaters, but
it is a pretty warm day today.
It's probably like in the
70's and not cold at all.
But it's nice, last year it snowed,
the year before that it snowed,
and then this year, we're just gonna have
a little bit warmer
weather, but it feels nice.
Hi little Lu.
Hi, are you having a good vacation?
Do you miss your Karmy?
If you don't know, Karma is at home
with some friends of ours
that are watchin' the house.
And so he is enjoying life
with no Luna and no kids,
and sittin' around havin' a good time.
- Good morning from the cabin!
Missy's already started on the cabin life.
- Yeah!
-  Puzzles!
- I know, and I'm like,
don't touch my puzzle!
-  Yeah, Ollie remember when
you messed up mama's puzzle that one time?
- Yeah, watch out my dragon.
-  Wow!
-  Let's not talk about that.
-  That's so cool.
(laughing)
What is this a puzzle of?
It's like a cat puzzle, oh gosh,
now I don't know what it looks like.
-  Oh, a hundred pieces?
- Look over the edge of the porch.
- Hey, mama!
- Yeah
- A kitty cat puzzle.
- I know, isn't that cute?
(instrumental music)
- Another cool thing about the cabin,
all the amazing blue jay's.
You just put peanuts everywhere.
(laughing)
Here's some more for you guys!
Uh-oh, this one fell.
Let's put this one right there.
Then, you go inside, and you try and get
a glimpse of 'em through the window.
(instrumental music)
There he is!
Look at that blue jay!
(laughing)
He stole my peanut and ran.
Look it, they're fighting over 'em now.
These are the blue jay's
that live outside the cabin.
They are so pretty.
Look at those birds, Ollie.
There's some more peanuts up there,
you think he'll get 'em?
-  I think that
bird is gonna take them.
-  Yeah, he took the peanuts!
- He's goin' to tip toe out there.
-  Oh, 'cause he's gotta be quiet?
- Yeah.
(laughing)
- Hey Ollie, why do you think
they're called blue jay's?
- Why?
-  'Cause it's blue!
- Blue?
-  Yeah, but guess what!
- What?
-  It also has the
same middle name as Finn!
- Finn?
-  Yeah!
Got your flashlights?
- Yeah we have, no,
these are search lights.
-  Oh, okay.
(upbeat music)
Puzzle time is growing to the extreme!
Cassidy and Carlos are here,
and we are puttin'
together a big puzzle now.
How many pieces is this one?
- 500, we finished the 100--
-  So you graduated from 100,
you moved on to 500, okay.
- I wish there was a 250,
but we just gotta go for it.
(laughing)
-  And the kids
have been running around
and just playing and having so much fun.
And I just watched a little clip
of when we were here
with them two years ago,
and I'm gonna try and recreate it.
-  Hi!
-  Hi, cutie!
-  I knew you'd smile!
-  Show it to him.
-  Yeah!
-  You share your toys with him?
-  He says ah!
(laughing)
Bless you!
Careful, don't bite his nose.
-  You put Ollie up on the couch.
Ollie, you need some brother time, okay?
-  Can you give
him a kiss real quick?
Aw.
- Good job.
- Good job.
-  Alright, we're
recreating the scene.
Alright Finn, you sit there.
Ollie, come over here!
- I can't!
(laughing)
-  He's stuck.
Sit right there next to your brother!
(laughing)
-  Alright, give him a kiss!
-  And then give him a kiss,
just like you did in the clip!
-  Aw, Finn's giving him a kiss.
-  You guys are--
-  Give him a kiss Ollie!
-  the cutest kids
on the internet still.
-  Ollie, give him a kiss.
-  Give him a kiss Ollie!
Aw!
(laughing)
-  They both like--
(laughing)
-  Alright, are you cuddling
or are you tackling him now?
- That is so crazy, he
was like a month old.
-  I know.
- Look at that same pillow.
-  Wow, who has the last piece?
- Well, if Jimmy would move his fingers.
(laughing)
-  Look how close they
are you guys, that is crazy.
- Oh no, we only have two pieces left.
-  What?
- Oh no, we're good, we're good.
Put it in!
-  It creates a
portal that you can jump into
to travel to the place!
- Yeah!
- Hurray!
- No missing pieces either!
- Yeah, and this piece was
throwin' us off for a while.
- You guys ever see someone
finish a puzzle before?
'Cause you just did, on Daily Bumps.
- How long did that take us?
-  I know, right?
-  So the flat piece was an
extra piece that just
didn't belong anywhere?
-  Was that so relaxing Missy?
- Oh yeah, that was so fun.
Alright, we've made it
to the town of Idlewild,
TJ and Bailey are gonna get to meet
Mayor Max for the first
time, are you guys excited?
Yep, make sure you shake
his hand really nicely.
Give him a good pet.
(laughing)
He's like, the sweetest dog.
Luna!
-  Luna Lu!
-  Are you gonna
get to meet Mayor Max?
- You wanna meet Mayor
Max, he's so fun and cool!
Come on, let's go see him.
-  Come on!
Aw, you're meeting Mayor Max!
-  Okay Max, look here.
-  Look at me Bailey!
(laughing)
Luna's turn!
Mayor Max, it's so good to see you!
-  Hi Max!
(laughing)
Luna, see Max?
-  Say hi!
Finn just woke up, and he said
he wanted to meet Mayor Max, huh?
- Where's Mayor Max?
Where is he?
Oh my goodness!
-  He's posin'
for pictures right now.
Alright, come say hi to Mayor Max!
- And see you pet him,
look how pretty he is.
-  He does selfies.
He knows how to do a selfie.
-  Alright, we're gonna selfie it!
Mayor Max!
(laughing)
Good job!
You're such a sweetie,
I've known Mayor Max since he was a baby!
Finn, give him a kiss!
- No!
(laughing)
- Look these pretty deer!
- They are so cool looking!
This is where Santa sits, Ollie!
You gonna see Santa?
He's gonna sit here, that's
where he sits under that,
'member you talked to him?
(holiday music)
Hi Santa!
Santa and Mrs. Clause!
Ollie, look it's Santa!
Say hi Santa!
- Hi Santa!
- Hi!
-  Hi Mrs. Clause!
(laughing)
- We're kinda cheating.
-  All the kids are like, what?
(holiday music)
We have, Olivia, Bailey,
Ollie, and Patence,
hogging the giant snowman.
Okay, let's not beat him up guys.
Ollie.
Say you're sorry.
- Sorry snowman!
(holiday music)
- And now what we have
all been waiting for,
we are gathered around this giant tree,
and they are going to light it up
with colorful Christmas lights.
- And every year I make this joke,
because I truly believe that we all should
just hold hands and sing--
♪ - Aroo dory, la who flory, ♪
♪ Welcome Chris-- ♪
Yeah.
- Anyways, we should sing that.
This is a cute little small
town, we love it here!
- Yeah.

Wow!
Aw, it's a little too much for Finn.
Jump, wow!
Now jump from the bed to the couch, Ollie.
- Okay.
-  Wow!
Alright, you ready?
Now jump to the couch, wow!
(laughing)
- I'm flying like a bird!
- Wow, Finn's gettin' closer.
This is what happens around bed time.
The kids have a little bit of energy left.
Go Finn, go!
Oh, he doesn't even get close.
(laughing)
It's a big jump.
Wow, oh, Ollie!
You're such a bug.
(laughing)
Try again Finn, try again!
