- Hey guys, and welcome to
a very, very special video.
Today's video is so exciting because
we are not only showing you guys,
but we are showing Ollie and Finn
their very first shared bedroom,
for the first time ever,
and we are so excited!
("Tribe" by Daily Bumps)
♪This is our life ♪
♪ Let's live it ♪
♪ Live it forever ♪
So, both of our boys are at the stage
where they both need something.
Ollie is really having trouble
being in his room on his own.
He gets scared, he wants to cuddle
in the middle of the night still,
he's having trouble
sleeping through the night.
Finn is still sleeping in his crib
and he is actually ready to transition
out of the crib and go into a bed.
So we thought, let's put
them both in the same room.
Let's give them both big beds
because Ollie definitely
needs a bigger bed.
And let's make this something
really, really special
that they can just cherish forever.
I think they're going to be
really excited when they see it.
- We've always actually thought about,
maybe one day, our kids sharing rooms
and I think it's really exciting
that they actually both
really want to share a room.
- They want to so bad.
- We basically do bedtime
together completely
and sometimes they even
both fall asleep together
and I have to take Finn out
because there's just not
enough room on a twin bed
for both of them without
waking themselves up
and kicking each other off.
So now they're both going to have room.
They can sleep together.
They can be in the same bed or same room.
- And I think, too,
let's put them in a room
while they like each other still.
- Yeah, totally.
- Because they're like best friends.
They want to be in the same room.
- I even shared a room with my brother
when I was younger and I think
it totally is a great
thing for kids to do.
I mean, if you can, I say why not?
You know, until there's a problem not to,
I say go for it.
So we're super excited.
- The room is big and
it turned out so good.
I've been buying and
looking and storing things.
We actually used a lot of
things from Finn's room
and Ollie's room, which is really cool.
And it all just kind of
came together so nice.
- Yeah.
- Should we show the boys?
- Let's, go show them.
-  Hey Ollie, Finn I
have something to show you guys.
Are you so excited to see your new room?
- Yeah!
- Alright Ollie, what are you most excited
about in sharing a room?
- Um, with Finn!
- You're excited about being with Finn?
- Yeah!
-  'Cause you and your
brother are good friends, huh?
-  Yeah.
-  Finn, are you
excited to see your new bed?
- Yeah.
-  You're going to be
sleeping in Ollie's room now.
It's going to be your guys's room, OK?
-  OK?
-  And it's going
to be your room too.
-  Are you trying to peek?
The boys are so excited.
-  They've been waiting all day.
-  Hang on, hang on.
Come on in, boys.
(dramatic music)
What do you think?
-  It's good.
-  Is that your new bed, Finn?
He's just, like, looking at everything
like he's so excited.
What is that?
- A tent.
-  That's your tent, bro.
Go inside and check it out.
Oh, you want to check out the bed, huh?
-  Oh my goodness,
what is this, Ollie?
-  This is your new bed.
Whoa, is that a giant acorn?
- Yeah!
-  That's so cool.
So, Ollie, check this out, bro.
When you are in your bed,
you can look out your window
- I'm (unintelligible)
and you can see a squirrel!
Look at that squirrel.
He's looking at you.
You know why?
- Why?
- Well because you have
the big acorn, right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he's looking at your acorn.
He's like, hey, give me that acorn.
- (unintelligible)
-  It's your acorn.
Hey Finn, do you want to see your bed?
You're going to sleep
right underneath Ollie.
Come here.
Isn't that exciting?
(squeals of delight)
(laughter)
He's so excited.
Look how good they are on that, too.
Whoa, you get a big bed
all to yourself, Finn.
Whoa dude, you even have
your own little bookshelf.
You found a lantern?
- Yeah.
- You can put your lantern here.
-  Oh, is there
books in there, Ollie?
Oh, "Chewie and the
Porgs", and you have books
up there in yours, too, huh?
Alright, you got your binoculars?
- Yeah.
- OK, put 'em up to your eyes,
take a couple steps back,
and look up at the top of your bed.
Look up at that giant owl.
He's looking at you.
(squeals of laughter)
Isn't that funny?
- Yah! Yah! Yeah, yeah.
- There's a bear! (screams)
(laughter)
- Put them up close to your eyes and look
all the way up there in the corner.
-  What do you see
up in the corner, Ollie?
-  Porg!
-  What is it?
- A porg!
-  A porg?
That's right.
We've got a porg hidden in the mural.
Ollie, check this out, you
have this huge toy box, OK?
And then you also have
all these awesome cubbies
for storage so you can put
all your favorite books
and treasures in there.
That's fun, huh?
- Yeah.
- That squirrel actually
has an acorn in its hand?
-  Uh, yes.
If you look closely, that little squirrel
up there is holding a real acorn.
Don't try to steal his acorn, OK?
-  He'll come after you.
- So, boys, this is not only a bed,
it's also a little play fort.
Look at you bed, has windows, yeah?
He's learning.
-  Say bye-bye.
-  Peace out.
You can even shut your door.
One more window. Shut the window.
He's like, "OK, peace out parents.
"I'm going to live in my bachelor pad."
What do you think of that?
-  Good.
- (unintelligible)
- Ollie, are you so excited
to share a room with Finn?
- Yeah.
- Oh, what's that?
New toys for both the boys.
Come here, Finn, look,
I got one for you too.
I got you a Swiss army knife.
It's not real, though.
It's just for pretend. See?
So when you guys go camping in your tent,
you have all the right tools, OK?
If you ever need a little light
in the middle of the night,
you have this really cool lantern here
and look, the button is right here.
All you have to do is
turn it off or on, OK?
- OK.
- Alright, let's turn off the
lights and shut the drapes
so you can check it out.
That is so cool.
I love these lights up here.
This is your secret hideout?
- Yeah.
-  That's so fun, huh?
- But if bears come, I can check
them out with my 'noculars.
-  That's right.
-  Do you want to see your closet?
- Yeah.
-  Your closet
is really cool, Ollie,
'cause now you get to share it with Finn.
- This is your side.
-  Got all your
clothes and goodies.
And then this is Finn's side.
All his stuff in there too.
It all fit really nicely, too.
Hey, Ollie, when we were
cleaning out your room
I found your dollar bill.
I kept it safe for you, OK?
- OK. But could you put it back for me
'cause I don't want Finn to see it.
-  OK.
Hey Ollie, I'm going to
turn this cool little camper
on your shelf into a piggy bank, OK?
-  OK.
- So you can put all your money in there
and it will be safe, sound good?
-  Yeah.
-  You like your tent, Finn?
- Yeah.
-  It's so comfy and
look you got a light up there.
Can you turn it on?
Push it!
Oh, daddy will help you.
- Oh.
-  Fire, fire.
-  We got you
guys critter blankets.
- This is a little blanket.
It goes over your head like this
and then you put your hands into the paws.
-  Oh, that's cool.
- And you wrap your arms around yourself
and then you get warm.
- And you're nice and warm.
-  Isn't that cool?
- Do you want to try?
- Yeah.
-  This one's a buffalo.
- (unintelligible)
-  (screams)
-  Get him, get him, get him.
(upbeat folk music)
- Come on Finn, before the bear comes!
-  You guys staying safe up there?
- Yeah.
-  Alright, this
is your safe place, OK?
(roaring)
-  Oh no, mommy bear's coming.
A mommy bear's attacking the campground.
(roaring)
I'm gonna get you.
(laughing and squealing)
It's too high, I can't get you.
-  OK, Ollie, remember when we were
in Idyllwild and you almost saw Bigfoot?
- Yeah.
-  Well, now, you too
can have big feet like a bear.
Look at your feet, they're
ginormous and hairy.
-  Oh my goodness.
-  Whoa, are they
really good for stomping?
- Yeah.
- Well, Ollie, what do you
think about your new room
that you're sharing with Finn?
- Good.
- You like it?
- Yeah.
- Did mommy and daddy do a good job?
- Um hmm.
- Love you.
- Oh no, the fire got blown out.
-  Oh no! It's OK,
you just gotta fix it.
Oh, look at Finny's big bear feet.
Hi big guy, I love you.
Hey, Finn, do you like
your new room buddy?
Can your feet come out? Oh!
He took his feet off.
So what do you guys
think of Ollie and Finn's
new shared room?
Let us know down below in the comments.
I am so excited with how it turned out
and I think now that the boys are so happy
they are literally playing in there
so we're going to let them play
and Missy and I are going to give you
a little walkthrough of the whole room
from when you walk in.
-  OK, so when
you first enter the room,
you see just this massive
mural on the wall.
I love how it turned out.
I just think it has so
much creativity in it.
I think it's a place
that the boys can look at
and just, like, imagine a world in there.
But we did, also, to kind
of give it a little more
of a 3-D view is we put
some branches on it.
-  Yeah so it's a
cool little branch hook.
We also have a couple
on the back of the door.
-  There's actually
quite a few little, like,
hidden things inside of the area.
We've got a big squirrel and an acorn
and I love that because it
really does make the whole room
just seem like, is this
real or is this fake.
-  Yeah, I think because she kinda
did some on the ceiling, too,
and like there's even a
bush on the other wall.
- Yeah, and over there too.
It really makes, you're
like, wait, is this real?
So I just love it.
I think this makes the entire room
just feel way bigger and more, like,
amazing than it really is, you know?
- What's really cool, too, is
this mural was done by someone local
and she was able to come
in on such short notice.
So huge thanks to Chante and
Just My Imagination Murals.
I'll have a link down
below in the description
so you can check out
some of her other work.
Hey, Ollie, did you see your
guys's name is carved in there.
That's pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.
- So for this section we wanted
to really have a place of play.
Playtime is so important.
Pretending is so important, imagination.
So we, literally, like look,
they're playing right now.
They're playing around the campfire.
So I wanted to make
this area like something
that they could feel like
they're interacting with
that they normally don't.
Being outdoorsy, camping is super fun.
So we have a nice A-frame tent
with a really nice wolf rug under there.
It's like a wolf gray
which is like beautiful
and so comfortable.
(squealing)
We have some really
cool seating like this.
We've got some of these.
These are awesome.
We actually picked these
up from Land of Nod.
So they're like little
beanbags that look like wood.
Which is cool, huh?
And then also over here we
have some boulder buddies.
So it's like just some
nice big ol' rock pillows.
So, they go with the theme
and they're functional
so if they're reading a
book or watching a movie
or anything like that they can just relax.
We have a big shelf here
for lots of pictures
and storage and fun little things
that they can just look at
and use their imagination.
Yes, these are acorns.
I ordered these from Etsy.
I had to have authentic New York acorns.
Here Ollie, you want one?
- Yeah.
-  Keep it safe, OK?
- OK.
- And then I love this tree bookshelf.
It's just so cool and it kinda just like
brings them in the element.
It's obviously super functional.
They have lots and lots of shelves
and storage places which is cool.
And the boys love reading so their bedroom
is a place of reading
and sleeping and playing
and we kinda wanted to incorporate all
those different elements in here.
Alright, babe, how are we doing?
One room, two kids, one closet.
How is this gonna work?
- Yes, so we are going from both kids
having their own dresser and closet
to just a closet.
-  One closet.
- No dresser.
So we basically split their
closet into two sides.
So this is Ollie's side.
He's got all of his shirts.
We are hanging a lot more of
his clothes than we used to,
which means a lot of his
pajamas are being hung now.
We've got a section for pants and shorts
and then all of his, like, sweatpants.
This is a little spot
for, like, some blankies
and then dirty clothes.
A little spot for socks.
- And now for Finn's closet.
- So Finn, same thing basically.
All his shirts, we even
hung a lot of his pajamas.
He's got his sweatpants, pants, shorts
and then a little section with, like,
a picture of him.
-  Awwww.
-  We still have
some random kid here.
We really need to change that out
but I'm kinda used to it now.
I feel like maybe he
really did look like this.
So I love it.
I really, really feel like this is a nice,
minimal closet and I feel like
it's going to be a lot
easier to figure out
what they're going to wear that day.
- And last but not least, the bed.
I wanted to get a bed where they both had
full mattresses.
I wanted a bunk bed style, but I also knew
I wanted something with a lot of character
that's going to make them feel comfortable
and safe and warm and cozy.
So we went with this
awesome cabin loft bed
and it has a trundle underneath with a bed
that may be there, it may...
We can take that out if we want.
They can both sleep up there.
We're kinda just going to
see what works for them.
- I love the fact that
we have plenty of room
for, like, their friends to sleep over
or for them to sleep and
not fall out of their bed.
I love the extra feature that we added
with, just like their little books
that they read at night.
-  Yeah, so the
bed had some exposed wall
so we put in those which
worked out really good.
- And honestly, a lot of times
when I read books to the boys
they just get shoved to the end of the bed
so it's gonna be so nice to
have a spot to place them.
-  Yeah.
- That?
-  Say hi squirrel.
- Squirrel!
-  Hey Ollie, did you
do your squirrel call yet?
- Squirrel!
- Hey Ollie, speaking of that squirrel
we're gonna have to name him, you know.
- Yeah.
-  What do you
guys want to name him?
- Um, Charlie.
-  Charlie?
That's a cute name and
then you can say good night
to Charlie the Squirrel every night?
- Yeah.
-  OK, what do you guys think?
Do you guys like the name Charlie?
Let us know down below in the comments
or if you guys have other suggestions,
let us know too.
And then we have a nice big toy box
which, of course, is empty.
- Yes, and I love that it
-  And cubbies.
We have so much stuff for toys.
- And you know what?
We never had a toy box in their room
and it just ended up that they always
had toys in their room
an nowhere to put it.
Now we have spots for it.
-  Yeah.
And for those of you who are wondering
we are probably going to be adding some
Christmas stuff on top of all this
and because their room was
decorated for Christmas.
But now that their new room is here,
they can sleep in it,
they can read books in it,
and they can grow up to
be best friends in it.
And I'm so excited.
- Let us know in the comments what is
your favorite thing about their new room.
I am absolutely in love
with every little detail.
But my favorite thing is the fact that
we can all lay in this bed, comfortably
and read books and just have a fun
cuddly night together
and I'm really excited
about tonight too, so, yeah!
- And my favorite thing
is probably this mural.
It's massive, it's
beautiful, it just creates
the whole scene of this room.
Alright, Ollie, what's your favorite thing
in your new room?
- The binoculars.
-  The binoculars?
- Yeah.
-  Alright Finn,
what's your favorite thing?
Show me your favorite thing in the room.
Show me!
- That is.
-  This is? The ladder?
- Yeah.
- The boys have been playing
in their new room all day.
It's been so cute.
And now we are just finally
getting them ready for bed
to go to bed in their new
bed for the first time
and I am really excited
to see how they do.
You all done brushing your teeth?
You ready for bed? OK.
- OK, let's go.
-  Oh, who's on your shirt, dude?
- Um, Yeti.
-  That's so cool.
How cool would it be, Ollie,
if we were to catch him
in our Christmas cave.
Wouldn't that be so cool?
(unintelligible)
You're wearing Yeti too, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
We should totally try to
catch a Yeti sometime, huh?
-  Yeah.
- Come on boys to your guys's room.
(cheering)
The boys are running to their room.
You still like your room?
- Yeah.
- Fred!
-  What?
-  Look!
-  Awww, hey Fred, I
was wondering where you were.
He was hanging out in your new room.
- Yeah.
- Is he going to sleep
on your bed tonight?
- Yeah.
-  Alright boys, climb into bed.
- Climb in the bed boys.
-  We're going to read some books
and go night night.
We're going to grab our
happy little lantern here.
Look at that.
Now you guys have light.
That's so cool, huh?
- Look at, these are stars.
-  Look at you guys
cuddling into your new bed,
it's so cool.
- And there's plenty of room
for me to cuddle with you.
-  Gotta grab Goodnight Moon.
I also got this new book.
(owl hooting)
So cute, it's called Brave Little Camper
because you guys are kinda
camping in your bedroom now, huh?
- Yeah.
-  And here's
Goodnight Moon, OK buddy?
- OK.
-  Have fun reading books guys.
I love you.
Give me a kiss. Mwah.
Love you.
- Love you, too.
- Night night Finn.
Alright, I'm going to
let them go night night
in their bed for the first time.
It's so exciting.
