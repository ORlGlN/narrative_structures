Wow it's like infinity Brian's good see
good morning I felt this little guy up
look how happy yes okay show him how
happy you are
smile get him dressed I got him in these
orange pants and I've pulled this shirt
out says all you need is love but uh all
you need is love love love is all you
need
oh where dolly there he is there he is
boom here you go brush your hair brush
your hair okay good good brush your hair
Oh almost it almost did it huh we're
actually filming on a new camera today
which I'm really excited about and all
he can see himself now because there's a
little screen so he kind of enjoys this
he's like I can look at myself
I'm in my area and I'm doing my makeup
and we're using my new camera or this
new camera and it's really hard not to
look up there oh I still need to do that
so we're using this new camera and I'm
actually pretty impressed with it it's
kind of fun to vlog and like know where
you are in the camera but like I said
it's really easy to not look at the lens
and look at the kit but the monitor
they say breakfast is the most important
meal of the day well I might have gone a
little crazy this morning I made Ollie
and I a big breakfast this morning
because he has not been eating all of
his dinner lately fact he's getting
really picky about like what he eats for
lunch and what he eats for dinner and so
he didn't really eat much last night so
I made him a nice hearty breakfast like
oatmeal eggs bananas and stuff and he
ate most of it so hopefully he's good
for the day
what is he walking like that but now I
have to clean this kitchen up because
pretty much a mess captain ollie hey
there kiddo
we're on your little mmm what are you
doing what are you doing go ahead steer
some more mmm you're the captain of this
ship huh yeah give off a hug say good
morning Olaf go Ollie go Ollie go Ollie
it's your birthday so much anticipation
huh today we are getting rid of the tree
so it's gonna open up this room a lot
more but she's gonna organize how she
wants it so that all he has lots of
space to play on his new toys
hugs to all off again
you give her hugs off you want to put
him down the slide here look at this you
can put him down the slide
oh he's not as graceful as you though so
now going to use my lunch that Ellie got
me it's by frat boy and I've never even
heard of the brand before because I knew
nothing about makeup I'm obsessed with
it because I used to would use like this
other blush by icing since the wars like
I was little digging it out and trying
to like put it on it is really bad this
stuff's cool good I just dab in it a
little blush to my face because it's so
white but I dunno I don't know much
about makeup so I just slap on some
makeup hope it looks okay and then I try
to look at it at all throughout the day
because I just don't want to see all he
is not being right now so this is always
a great time for me to get ready for the
day and the car would always likes to
hang out in here good morning good
morning I do my makeup you can't just
kiss me all over you just have to let me
know if you like seeing me do my makeup
because it's not something that I ever
show because I wouldn't say that I'm
self-conscious about it but I just don't
like to show me doing my makeup I don't
know just feels personal to me just for
me though I like watching people do
their makeup I also need to do my hair
holy moly have you guys checked out this
bun that is a bun right there
and voila that's as good as it's gonna
get my bangs are just gonna sit here and
walk around and then slowly throughout
the day you'll see you know this kind of
fall is just part of part of it just you
know that's how I do it anyways I'm
pretty much all ready and I can check my
makeup in this thing it is really weird
to get used to you guys I'm gonna try
and get not be as awkward with it but
like I honestly because I can see myself
it's like more awkward like I feel like
I'm like oh god I shouldn't revolve you
right now I don't know look good you
know whereas normally you can't see
yourself so just like whatever it
doesn't matter I can't see myself but
now you see myself so so they're like
really weird
I'm sorry I'm pennyways I just got done
doing my makeup probably still asleep
yay and I have been watching YouTube
videos while I do my makeup and karma
has been wanting to go outside huh you
want to go be free
okay the last of Christmas is about to
leave it's just starting to turn yellow

it's not too dry but here it goes I
actually helped him bring it the tree in
and I was like no way I'm helping bring
it out I like totally hurt my wrist

been loving seeing me tear off pages in
my grumpy cat box calendar so I don't
know if I can do it every day but I'll
try and do it as much as I remember but
today is January 3rd and 4th
I guess there's two for the weekend
Sunday is gonna be a full moon so that's
cool it's not the Sun that's hurting my
eyes it's your face has enyone explored

new selves this is your new self and
look at this wow it's like infinity
Brian's what
isn't that cool though because we can
actually like frame the shot while we're
filming and then when we turn around we
can just like flip the screen if we want
all right guys so Mimi and Papa get in
their car worked on so we're taking them
to Old Town Temecula and I think they
have an ice rink down here so we're
gonna see if Missy and I can ice rink
Missy do you know how to ice skate I

I follow my bun I'm pretty good and
Ollie can we got Ollie to ice skate he's
thinking I don't think so hey I'll do it
yeah there is a lot of people on that
ice rink you guys that's crazy I don't
understand how those people are ice
skating they're not really ice skating
right
yeah those are cute
we could take oli huh we'll have to try
and come back and see if it's doing it
on Monday when it's less busy and come
back and see if we can do it cuz I'll
expand its just it's like an ice rink in
Southern California it's the craziest
thing right
alright we resorted to churros hot

donut or not they made don't they like
fall apart in your mouth they're so good
look at this you guys he's old their
Christmas tree out
Mike wall we took our Christmas tree

up what are we gonna do we have to kill
time babe oh we do need to do that huh
red window where the winds go and we've
got my mom putting on shoes and socks my
dad's working on the jacket and we're
just stand-in here could you guys hurry
up we need to get some grocery shopping
done whenever we leave or go somewhere
when he's in the car seat takes
everything off we're just standing here
relaxing while they take care of our
admiring the new low light sensitivity
of our camera where it's quite good we
are like in laughs right now what we
have our lights in Paris but that's
pretty much it how are you ready he's
dressed look he's smiling at himself
because he can see himself he's like oh
I'm cute hey Olli I think that's way too
many cheese it keeps him holding still
are you embarrassed yet Missy we can't
take your dad anywhere we are trying
something different out tonight you guys
I found calamari steak so I cut some up
and I made a little pink oh batter and
I'm frying some up to see how they turn
out Missy and I love fried calamari
so hopefully this turns out good because
it's quite expensive when you go to
restaurants usually like 10 to 15 bucks
and I feel like I got a ton of calamari
for 4 bucks so if this works this could
be like a new house favorite we've got
two little testers here and some ranch
