a few days ago we had talked about doing
this little wine rack board and we
talked about doing yes we talked about
doing real succulents and I know well we
I just I just couldn't wrap my brain
around you guys gave me awesome
suggestions like there are websites of
people that do this and I was like okay
this is possible I could do this never
thought about the upkeep and it being
inside and we're like let's just you
think yeah we bought a lot of fake
succulents and like a ton of this like
cool crab grass this is actually real
but yeah it's so I've just been hurried
I love it so far it's so cool we just
got all these different ones to come out
I really like it I think I think this is
probably the better option than doing
the real ones but yeah maybe one day
when I'm feeling more adventurous I
could do a project like that this one I
love
yeah it looks so cool it's like big and
yeah I think it's cool love it
yeah Brian's finished doing all this cuz
get to the artsy yeah he's enjoying it
but this one's gonna go in our bathroom
and then I have another one that I'm
gonna try and hang somewhere in the
house I'm actually thinking maybe over
by the dining room just to kind of pop
in some greenery actually this might be
a fun place for it too I don't know
haven't decided yet where the other
one's gonna go
all right we just got the thing hung and
it's pretty heavy and it's a little bit
crooked but I love it it's a little
crooked Jeffrey but what do you guys
