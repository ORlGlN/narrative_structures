just really really uncomfortable and if
I open my eyes and really really hurt so
I just been keeping my eyes shut my dad
on the other hand how do you feeling uh
just dude great you can see everything
right and he's not in any pain
I just gonna say you can do LASIK LASIK
so he'd go mine let's show you how I
look
oh gosh can't really yeah I am trying
you got it exotic a little bit I'm nice
shot and the and sunglasses on and my
eye still hurt from a little bit of Sun
that's coming through howdy everybody
today is gonna be a really fun day I'm
actually headed to LA to go shoot my new
music video we found a really great
studio it's really super unique inside
so we're gonna be filming there all day
for my music video we have an
announcement coming on all my social
media but by this time you've probably
already seen it so I will tell you guys
right now you ready announcement I'm the
EP that I've been working on for the
last six months it's going to be
available for pre-order on the twelfth
that's Saturday this Saturday you guys
the pre-order for my new EP is going to
be available and when you preorder it
you're actually going to get my very
first single right away which will be
the song like a lion I know you guys
have been hearing about this a lot and
it's finally all happening and it's just
really really exciting so yeah that
happens on Saturday and I think that
officially means on iTunes that it will
be Friday night like 8:00 p.m. Pacific
Standard Time so new music coming later
this week and then the official release
for all the songs and the entire EP will
be on my birthday January 20th which
will be one year since I released this
is home I just thought it'd be so it'd
be such a great date if I did it on that
because it's the one-year anniversary of
this is home one of my all-time favorite
songs that I've written really this kind
of like humble then I feel really super
blessed
that I can do something like this it's
always been a huge dream of mine and
it's kind of coming true another cool
thing today I'm actually meeting my band
for the very first time I am good night
so a magician just got back from the eye
doctor and everything is looking really
good I actually put some numbing drops
in my eyes so I'm a little bit smiley or
today or right now the numbing gosh
lonely lost like 30 minutes or so but it
just gives you like a little bit of
relief of course my eyes are very
sensitive to light so I literally can't
open them because of the light but my
plan today is just kind of continue to
rest he said opening my eyes closing my
eyes isn't gonna affect like my healing
process at all so I can open them as
much as I want close them as much as I
want but I'm probably gonna want them
closed more than open just because it's
going to be more comfortable and the
lights and sensitivity is really intense
I've just been taking care of this guy
as much as possible and a little bit of
a milk coma I definitely would not be
able to do this without my sister and my
mom and even my dad who just had LASIK
surgery but he's even been a huge help
so with this I wouldn't be able to do
the PRK without their help
