she's really adjusting the house when

diners yeah she is I mean who isn't I'm
afraid of that thing so I wanted to show
you guys he got her little soft paws
she's got these cute little pot or like
they're like a soft plastic yeah it's
like a soft almost like even like a
silicone they're very like soft and
stuff but they go right over the nail
and they help so that if you're kids or
even when he's scratching the furniture
it kind of stops it from that from that
happening so I'm really excited about
that and they're cute they're pink and
they're really fun but it was actually
funny because yesterday Olly was playing
with her and he wasn't doing anything
bad but she just like accidentally
scratched him and it was nothing major
like super super light no marks anything
but it was enough to make him so sad and
not because it hurt but because his
kitty hurt him and it was so sad he was

I feel like we're never at the mall when
it's this busy babe crazy so many kids
but lakes are occupied so I'm working on
a fun little project right now the idea
is that all aggress we're going to are
going to come through this door and as I
walk in they will come under a little
jungle of trees leaves and dinosaurs and
so I'm attempting to basically set up
all these greenery Leafs up here and
hopefully they hang down sort of like a
jungle on debating on whether I can do
if I have enough to go on the other side
as well sort of sort of like jungle II
and then I'm gonna hang dinosaurs from
up here and have them like flying up
above so I'm really excited hope it
turns out hope it looks good I gotta
somehow get all these up here and
arrange them so they look cool over this
archway looks good
hot crafty mom alert Missy's making a
jungle looks very leafy Holly we're
creating a jungle a dinosaur jungle yeah
