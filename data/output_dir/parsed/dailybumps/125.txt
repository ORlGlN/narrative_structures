-  Boys, Mommy and
Daddy are gone, right?

Good morning guys,
Missy and I just woke up
in our villa.
What (laughs)?
We are eating breakfast outside.
It feels amazing.
Of course, no breakfast is complete
without a little Mario, right?
I'm so excited to eat.
I have a burrito, and
bananas, and waffles.
And we're staying at this
amazing place by the beach.
And what's funny is, I
booked so last minute
that the room we got was
already a pretty nice room.
Then when we got here, they upgraded us
to a four bedroom villa.
Sleeps like 20 people.
It's just us two (laughs).
I know I was like, "Is that
okay, it's just us two."
And they were like,
"Oh no, you'll love it.
"There's lots of space."
So I'm like, oh my gosh,
there is lots of space.
Check this out.
We have fireplace, living room, kitchen.
I've never been in something like this.
It's like a two story hotel villa.
It's kind of crazy (laughs).
And there's like a whole
other side over there.
So I was like okay, but they upgraded us
because they were booked; completely full.
They had to make room, so I was like,
"Alright, I guess we'll take
this huge, nice villa, right?"
-  Yup.
-  Time to dig into this burrito.
(cheerful instrumental music)
Babe, check out all
those Italian gondolas.
That's so cool.
-  How cool would
it be to ride in one?
Yeah, that would be really fun.
-  I know, should we do it?
Yeah.
Okay, (laughs) I booked us
a couple's gondola ride.
So they're gonna take us
on one of these cool boats,
and give us a little tour
of the bay here in Newport.
It's kinda cool, huh?
Look at that one, it's
like a little house.
-  Yeah, it's so cool.
(cheerful instrumental music)
So we are taking a gondola
ride, here in Newport Beach.
And we're going through
the Newport Channel.
And they have the coolest boat right here,
check this out.
It says Hogwatts Express 9 3/4 (laughs).
That's so cool.
It's a Harry Potter themed little boat.
Oh maybe, I don't know.
(Italian music)
We might be boarded babe
by pirates (laughs).
This house clearly loves pirates.
Check this out.
Oh, that's so cool.
(pirate instrumental music)
Look at what we found here
in very cloudy Newport Beach;
an old telephone booth.
I'm on my phone.
-  What?
Just on my cellphone.
Yeah, I love how it says,
"Payphone is no more,
"cellphones close this door."
we just got done with our gondola tour,
so it's like a little taste of Italy.
This is so fun.
Now I just wanna go to Italy.
I know, I really do.
We're walking along Newport,
trying to find our way
to the water, so we can go explore.
Go through some of the shops.
We just found a hammock.
You gonna get in it babe?
We're literally just
walking around randomly.
We don't really know where to go.
I think we're gonna call an
Uber and go to Laguna Beach.
Be careful babe.
Whoa, that is cool.
I actually love the way it looks
with the tassels on the side.
Yeah, I feel like I'm just
on an island somewhere.
Looking at the palm trees.
-  Not a bad view, huh babe?
Not a bad view.
Is there room for two?
Yeah.
I love how my wife just finds a hammock
and gets in it.
Are you gonna get in?
-  No, I'm not.
Why?
(cheerful instrumental music)
-  Boys, Mommy and
Daddy are gone, right?
Yeah.
-  Yeah, so Papa
and Meme decided we're
gonna play a fun game.
Now this game is called Tiny Hands, okay?
So you have to use tiny hands,
to get all the fun things you want, okay?
No.
 So we're gonna show you
how to use your tiny hands.
Okay, Papa's gonna put 'em together,
and we're gonna put on our tiny hands.
(upbeat music)
-  Biting a marshmallow
with their tiny hands.
-  Can only use
your tiny hands, ready?
Go.

We had a really awesome day.
We actually explored the city of Newport.
We had dinner, and we just walked around.
And now we're ready for bed.
It's like 10 o'clock and
we're like, "Let's go to bed."
We drove to a bowling
alley nightclub place,
and then we were like, "Or
we could just go home."
Yeah, let's just go home.
I'm so excited to see
what the boy's been up to
with Meme and Papa, cuz they always have
so much fun with them.
I think they've had a lot of fun.
