- Is it for humans?
-  Yeah, try it!
It's just a sprinkle.
- It's just like flour,
applesauce, random things.
-  It's good stuff.
Try it.
(laughs)
Did you just eat dog food?
(Missy laughs)
♫ This is our life, this our fun

- Good morning!
- Good morning!
Good morning, Finn.
Good morning, guys.
It is a beautiful day here in Cali.
It's sprinkling, huh?
- Yeah.
-  It's raining a little bit.
So the boys are playing outside.
Luna's trying to get into the fortress.
Hi, Luna!
Good morning!
Good morning, Luna Loo!
Hi, baby!
- Can you open this?
- Of course I can!
Of course!
It's October.
You eat Halloween candy
for breakfast, right?
- Yeah.
- No, the boys have
actually been really good,
but today I'm like, if
you guys want candy,
you can eat candy, okay?
I'm in the festive spirit.
It's a Friday.
It's a good day.
There you go, my boy.
What do you say?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
But yeah, check this out you guys.
California's like, oh, is it October?
Should I be acting like it's October?
It's a little chilly out here.
And like I said, it's
even starting to sprinkle,
which is cool.
I love fall time because it's just like,
that feeling, the smell
in the air, like it feels
different in October for some reason.
Uh oh, I think all the
sprinklers are turning on!
Oh no!
Yeah, we've been trying to
fill in these little holes
in our grass for a while,
so we've been seeding
and doing sprinklers,
and trying to make this all
look really, really nice.
(bright beat music)
- Hey, guys!
- Hey.
- So today, Ollie said he really wanted to
answer some questions, huh?
So we decided to ask you guys on Twitter,
using the hashtag #AskDailyBumps,
and we got a bunch of questions
and so we just chose some,
and I'm gonna let you answer some, 'kay?
Alright, here we go.
The first question comes from Maelyn,
and she says, "Ollie what
is your favorite dinosaur?"
- A T. Rex!
- Alright, next question, Ollie,
is from Amy, and she says,
"What's your favorite thing
about the holiday season
"having kids?"
I think my favorite
thing is just being able
to relive a lot of the
moments that I got to do
as a kid, and kinda watching
it through his eyes.
- Go, go.
(Missy laughs)
- And everything is just so
much more magical with them.
Okay, next question is
from Gabby, and she says,
"What is your most favorite
thing about vlogging?"
What's your favorite thing about vlogging?
- I love doing fun stuff with my family.
-  That's good, and what else?
- I love doing thumbs up.
- (laughs) He was like,
"Mama, I really love giving thumbs up."
I was like, alright say that!
So yeah, make sure you
guys thumbs up this video,
'cause that's Ollie's favorite thing, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
(laughs)
- Ollie wants to take a break,
and now Finn wants to go,
okay, the next question
is from The Daily Fam,
the question is "Best prank
you've pulled on someone."
Hands down, the best
prank I've ever pulled
was the one I did on Bryan with the snake.
I've never been able to pull
off a prank, like, good before,
I'm usually like giggling and laughing,
and I did a really dang good job,
and his reaction was perfect,
exactly what I was hoping for.
So if you guys haven't watched that,
make sure you click the link
up here, and go watch it.
It was hilarious.
The next question is
from Daily Bumps Gifs,
and she says, "Missy, what is
your advice to help someone
"get motivated to work out more?"
It's hard for me to give
advice, because everyone has
different motivations that
get them to that point.
For me, I love the fact that every time
I go back to the gym, I
feel like even stronger.
I know that what I'm doing
today is gonna be awesome
because the next time I go to the gym,
it's gonna be a little bit easier,
plus I can push myself
a little bit farther.
Plus, the hope of one day maybe
losing the weight and
feeling really comfortable
in yourself is always good, too.
But I just love the
little goals that you make
throughout the week or months
that you actually can meet.
Looks like both kids have ditched me now,
so I'll just finish a couple
more of these questions.
Janelle asks, "How is
Ollie doing at school?"
He's doing awesome.
He loves it.
He's learning so much.
He's learning how to
just like, really listen
and cooperate because
he's being forced to.
It's been a really,
really cool experience,
and I'm really excited about the school
that we chose especially.
Next question is from
Rayne, and she asked,
"Can you show us Finn's bed set up?"
Sure I can, let's go!
So this is Finn's bed set
up. Basically his mattress
is all the way to the floor.
He's got this little net
that this thing flips down and zips up.
Because he is a master at
getting out of the crib.
I never had to do this with Ollie.
And then in order for
him to sleep really good,
he needs a sound machine on,
and this sound machine on.
He needs like a noise
maker and a music maker.
Oh, and then also a little
light maker. (laughs)
He needs all these things
so that he can sleep
in his bed at night,
and a really good sleep.
(laughs) And that's what works.
Alright, last question
is from Liz, I believe,
"Gonna get any more pets for the house?"
I don't see us getting any more pets
for the house anytime soon,
although I'm not sure
about outside of the house.
But, speaking of pets...
(energetic bright music)
- Happy birthday, Luna!
Happy birthday, girl!
- It's her birthday!
- That's right.
- How old is she, Ollie?
- Um, one!
- Yeah!
- She is now one years
old, and she is such a good
little puppy dog, aren't you?
Aren't you?
Ollie, do you remember when we got Luna?
- Yeah.
-  How did we get Luna?
- Santa brought her.
- Yeah!
- That's right!
Santa brought her for Christmas, huh?
And now she's our puppy, and
she's such a good puppy, huh?
Happy birthday, Luna.
That's right, it's your birthday.
We're giving you lots of treats.
She's getting all the treats she wants.
-  (laughs) She's getting
so many treats right now.
- She's gonna have treats,
she's gonna have a
special birthday costume.
We're gonna have a little activity,
and she's even gonna open some presents.
'Cause we are gonna
spoil our little puppy.
(upbeat music)
We have some funny outfits to put on her.
This one has a little cupcake.
And then we also have
a hat, and of course,
a bib that says it's my birthday.
Luna, you got your
special birthday shirt on!
Check it out, she's so
pretty in her shirt.
-  Oh, and you need your bandana.
It says, it's my birthday. (laughs)
-  Aw, she looks so happy. (laughs)
She actually does look
really happy, it's so cute.
Hi, Luna!
Oh, look at that thing going crazy!
You silly puppy.
-  It's my birthday!
(upbeat music)
-  Hi, Luna.
Hi, Luna.
Hi, Luna.
Look at her.(laughs)
You think she's enjoying herself already?
Happy birthday, Luna.
Happy birthday, Luna.
- So I picked this up at
the pet store the other day,
and it's this decorating
kit for their birthday,
and it comes with a little
cookie and a cupcake,
and this is what it looks
like, and I thought it would be
super fun for the kids to
get to decorate the cookies.
So it comes with icing, and
it even comes with sprinkles.
Then they get to eat
it, and so the kids are,
like, super excited to decorate it
so we're gonna go ahead
and decorate it now.
Finn's gonna do the cupcake,
and Ollie's gonna do the bone.
This is our expectation. (laughs)
It's super cute, and we're
gonna have the boys decorate it,
so we'll see how it turns out.
(Finn babbles)
Are you excited?
-  Whoa, that's so cool.
-  Oh, that's cute.
-  It's like little swirlies.
(upbeat music)
Finn's gonna sprinkle some sprinkles.
- Go like this.
-  Woo!
Look at your cookies for Luna, boys!
You made those, that's awesome!
(Missy laughs)
- Is it for humans?
-  Yeah, try it!
It's just a sprinkle.
- It's just like flour,
applesauce, random things.
-  It's good stuff.
Try it.
(laughs)
- Did you just eat dog food?
-  (laughs) Is it good?
-  Yeah!
-  Yeah? You like it?
(Finn babbles)
-  Finn's like, yeah, I'll eat it.
- Nom nom nom.
-  Those are for Luna.
That was so nice of you boys.
♫ Happy birthday to you
♫ Happy birthday to you
♫ Happy birthday dear Luna
♫ Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, Luna!
We love you.
- Eat it, eat it, eat it!
-  I feel like I'm
so full of treats! (laughs)
-  Yeah. (laughs)
More treats, really guys?
She likes it.
-  She's like, give that to me!
That is mine!
- That is hers.
Maybe she'll share with
you, though, okay guys?
(Missy laughs)
-  Do you guys want a bite?
- It's not good for humans.
-  No, I'm sure it's fine. (laughs)
Alright, Luna, here's a present.
Here, what's this?
Do you know that's for you?
Do you know how to unwrap it?
Get it!
I had a feeling this was gonna happen,
so we're gonna have to bring in Karma
to have him teach her
how to unwrap presents,
like a true puppy.
Karma!
Karma, Luna, come on!
Come on, guys!
Karma, we need your help!
Come on, Luna!
Luna will be right back,
she had to go potty.
Alright, Karma, can you teach
Luna how to open this present?
Get it, Karma! Get it!
See, Luna, listen, you
gotta put your paw on it,
and then you rip apart
the tape with your teeth,
there you go.
Get it, Karma, get it!
He is so delicate
when he is unwrapping
presents, it's so funny.
Finish unwrapping it!
- Get it, boy, get it!
Get it, boy, get it!
- There you go.
- Good job!
-  That is how you
unwrap a present, Luna.
- (laughs) Whenever your
kid's having a first birthday,
your oldest usually helps them.
-  Yeah.
Kinda like the same with Karma and Luna?
- I know it!
That's my boy!
(laughing)
-  Karma's a good boy, huh?
Open it, Karma, open it!
So what did Luna get?
She got a snake?
-  A pink snake.
-  That's so cool!
Here Luna, wanna open this one?
Here, get it.
- Get it Luna, get it!
-  It's a little bone
that says it's my birthday.
- It says happy birthday,
Luna, I love you!
- Oh, that's what it says, huh?
Karma's finishing up this
one for her. (laughs)
Oh, it's a tug of war!
Luna loves playing tug of war with Karma,
it's actually really cute.
Oh, oh, oh!
Get it, get it!
Tug of war!
Oh, oh, who's gonna win?
Who's gonna win?
Who's stronger, Luna or Ollie?
Let us know in the comments below!
Who do you think is gonna win this epic
tug of war match?
You still have time to leave a comment!
Ollie, or Luna?
Who's it gonna be, ladies and gentlemen?
Who's it gonna be?
(laughs) Get it!
They are both battling
it out for the title
of tug of war champion.
-  Get it, Ollie! Get it! (laughs)
-  She's bringing you down, Ollie.
She's bringing you down.
You ain't gettin' that.
Oh!
Luna won!
(laughs)
Aw, good job, guys.
- Hey, gimme that.
I'm back.
-  He's back! (laughs)
She's gettin' it!
She's gettin' it, oh!
She's gettin' it!
(laughs)
There you go, Ollie!
Just use your weight against her!
(upbeat music)
Oh!
And it's Karma versus Luna!
Who is the winner?
Who's gonna win?
Get it, Karma!
Oh, Karma gave it up to her.
(Missy laughs)
He's like, it's your
birthday, I'll go easy.
- I think it's just
like a little too close,
when it's like further away.
- Oh yeah.
Look at Karma in the spirit.
Aw.
Love your hat, Karma.
(laughs)
It's dinner time for these fishies.
We're putting in some
food and some seaweed.
Oh!
We've got some blood worms, too?
You guys are spoiled.
We have a new fire angelfish,
and we haven't really
got a good shot of her.
She's peeking out right there.
-  (laughs) She gets so nervous.
-  Yeah.
Come on, come on, come on.
Look at that fish, you guys.
Such a pretty fish, we
just want to see you.
(smooth guitar music)
We are getting seaweed for the fish,
and the dogs are going crazy over it.
- You will not like this.
This is gross.
You would not like this.
This isn't dog food.
-  This is fish food. (laughs)
- Yeah, Karma was like, yeah,
you're right, ew. (laughs)
Alright, we gotta put one more in.
-  Hey Ollie, what
do you think we should name
our new red angel fish?
- Um, Tina!
- You think Tina?
- Yeah.
- Hmm...
-  That's interesting.
Missy, what do you want to name it?
- I wanna name it Rajah,
from the tiger from Aladdin.
- What do you guys
think we should name it?
Tina or Rajah?
I'm gonna have an iCard poll in the corner
if you guys wanna click that, answer it,
and we'll choose the one you pick.
Those are two good names, right?
- Mm-hmm, actually I like them both.
-  Yeah.
You guys actually helped
us name this big guy.
- The choices were
between Rafiki and Dude.
I really, really wanted Rafiki,
'cause he looks like Rafiki,
but you guys chose Dude,
so that's his name. (laughs)
- Yeah.
You guys are doing a good job
at helping us name our fish.
(laughs)
(smooth guitar music)
This boy is a wild one.
Huh, Finn?
- Do you like crazy?
- Yeah.
And you're a good one?
- (laughs) This boy is a good one.
- Self-proclaimed good boy.
That's what you are.
(laughs)
-  That was so cute.
- Yeah!
It is an oatmeal and applesauce dinner
kinda night, isn't it?
These boys love oatmeal.
And honestly, it smells really good,
I might just eat some oatmeal, too.
- I think it smells like dog poop.
-  You do? Why?
- 'Cause...
(Finn babbles)
- Why would you say that, Ollie?
It doesn't smell like dog poo!
- Yes it does.
-  Luna, did you
leave us a birthday poo?
Is that what you did?
No, Luna's a good puppy.
-  Yes, she did!
-  No, she didn't!
-  Yes, she did!
-  Don't tease
Luna on her birthday!
It has been such a crazy
long day, hasn't it, Ollie?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we've been working
so hard on some projects
for you guys that are
coming out later this month.
Are you excited?
- Uh-huh.
- Do you wanna tell 'em?
- Uh-huh.
- Don't tell 'em! No!
Don't tell 'em! Don't do it!
- The jack.
- No!
- Yeah.
- Anyway, that's all for today's vlog.
