sure the vlog was up and I would love to
like it like maybe like an editor like
only when we're on vacation but every
time we travel that's like always when I
make the videos like extra cool and

me tell you he did not want to put down
his Woody doll he was pretty much
addicted to it all the way to the end
but I was just doing some dishes I've
been catching up on a little bit of
housework you know I tend to leave the
house clean when I leave it just ends up
getting really messy as soon as we walk
in the door so it's always like tons of
stuff for me to clean especially
unpacking which I have not done yet have
so much done tag but luckily we were
staying in house so I did a lot of
laundry so I don't think I have any
laundry to do so that is always a plus
I'm pretty much addicted to going on
vacation to places that have washer and
dryers because it is a huge help so when
you come home you don't have three loads
of laundry to do
but yeah actually I am super bone though
we do not we were supposed to go grocery
shopping today and I'm out of a lot of
like essentials that I usually need for
