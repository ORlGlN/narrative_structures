appraised okay so I had it I went
through Linda and I went through the box
and we found that and it was so beat up
it was super thin on the bottom it was
like total antique but it looked like a
nice real ring and Aunt Linda said she
wore it a lot when she was younger
because it's a super one out so I took
it to Kay and got it completely
refurbished well and they fixed it up
they said it's over 80 years old so I
was talking to Linda and I said did you
know it's over 82 years old she said she
must have got it from her mom Damelin I
really want to give it to me yeah she's
yeah and it's DC holic antique it is
it's like white gold and yellow gold and
all real all real stones on it too babe

lot of nice things it's like this is a
pin that she she wore when she worked at
the school in the in the lunch
department this doesn't - it says Louise
on it say knew you wanted a like another
kind of ring to wear it's sized for your
right hand it's a little bit bigger
