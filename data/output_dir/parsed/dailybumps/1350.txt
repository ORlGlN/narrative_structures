good morning little buddy what are you
doing playing with an octopus that's
cool this is our son baby
the boy is gonna do amazing things could
I meet him you guys I made him some
scrambled egg yolk you want one
will you eat one I give it to you I
normally have to put the egg yolks in
his mouth because he likes to squish
them feed him to the dog get them
everywhere now that's pretty Nami huh
good morning you guys I am up and I just
made ollie breakfast look at these fancy
eggs my wife got so the all the eggs are
in the middle and then that folds over
and then that folds over Gideon genius

we're gonna get any broken eggs that way
boom come a licking your feet not gonna
there you go he's such a good little
eater in the morning so yeah if you guys
don't know we are still feeding Ollie an
egg yolk every morning you'd have an egg
yolk over the white just because the
yolk is a lot healthier for babies and
we literally just put like a dab of
coconut oil in the pan when we cook it
up and it makes it just the way he likes
it he loves this egg mmm oh you're still
working on that one I'll put that one
there when you're ready okay

there guys I have been getting ready all
morning and cleaning up Oh and watching
YouTube I'm watching a Elly's video for
target whole yeah just been cleaning up
and doing laundry look I made seven
bucks for doing the laundry always
actually and ready to wake up from his
nap
look how Bryan has set up this playpen
area now I love how he's setting it up
because normally we were setting it up
like right up against here and then it
was like coming over here and it was
kind of annoying because like no one
could even walk in the room it was just
like really frustrating now he's got
like smash behind there and he gets all
this area and then this kind of goes
over here and it works out perfectly I
actually don't even feel like I have to
like cleaning up because when he's not
in it I'm like cleaning up get it out of
here I like it it's it's really nice
what are you doing you got your ball and
I go get Olly go get your brother come
on
is he here my baby boy oh please I give
me that camera
Gary timing yeah I could him sitting
here he's just like what's up like he
sleeps so good and then when he wakes up
he literally just sits in his crib and
plays with his toys and he does he
doesn't even usually say a word like he
just wants to play and hang out and
chill and it's so cute I just never
heard of such a thing as like a kid just
waking up casually and peacefully and
then just hanging out I'm just waiting
for momma and daddy to come getcha
I think it's safe to say that I am
loving watch dogs on the nude TV guys
haven't seen yesterday's vlog I broke
the TV with one of our lights while
Missy was filming her video so go watch
that video because we lost a TV in the
making of it I will have it linked below
in the description so we got this big
old TV
literally like an inch on each side Oh
put that gun away we got a new TV
solutely got like an 8 on each side just
a little bit bigger than our other ones
so that one was actually pretty big too
but this is a 60-inch TV she said no to
the 70 inch I said we can get rid of the
TV Center and just put it right there
but she just wasn't having it for some
reason I don't girls I don't know handy
the cakes show them your cute little
outfit you got come here let me see
so he's got these cute little anchor
shorts on and then is that little sea
captain with an anchor and hiegel they
look adorable yes you do ahh oh my gosh
I think I actually kind of touched him
okay he is off he said I can enough
let's go into our room there you go
there you go there oh he's like not
going down the stairs yeah okay that's
good right now I'm gonna bleep you
swallowed ah he like he has little
anchors on Schwartz and I had little
sailboats on the shorts he was imagine
twinsies okay so we are headed to go see
a house real quick and of course it's
right at all of his lunch time in you're
hungry huh so I brought him a little bit
of applesauce but he seems to be very
confused at the fact that I'm feeding
him lunch in the car what do you think
this is weird
no that's not it I know that stop trying
to grab it stop trying to grab it
so good no oh gosh no you sneeze with
food in your mouth that's not good you
talking the fish hey hey little girl
like you they're just funny Oliver hey
Oliver hey why is your foot up think he
realizes hey don't know anyways okay
guys it is officially summer I think
this place is packed
Meredydd guys barely even find a table
to eat but we just went and saw the
house and it just was not what we are
looking for at all we're having such a
hard time and I don't know why like it's
so hard to find a nice place that's all
put together and I think again we are
pretty picky
alright Ali's getting little foot output
measured it's right at the three Danny
so we're gonna put him in a 4y okay for
why or why he lied about his daddy's
white feet exactly see why this little
kid needs some shoes we're getting you
some good shoes k buddy he's walking
around everywhere
this one because I think it's going to
be the most meaningful one out of the
closest I like that blue and orange one
that one looks cool you guys are cool
yeah yeah these are like waterproof you
can go like in the ocean and so these
ones show them they have like the soft
motion so this is a step two so that's
kind of flexible it's for him to just
start walking I think it's important to
have your baby without shoes as much as
possible
yeah if and I think they learn better to
like walk yeah but obviously he's gonna
have to learn policies there's no like
look at these shoes you guys oh so cool
again yeah don't you're looking a few
you would I have a Curious George one
missing Oh in case you guys are curious
