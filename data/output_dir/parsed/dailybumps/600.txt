magazine Ollie
he's like cool story bro so yeah People
magazine came over we did a huge photo
shoot I think was like six hours and
then they interviewed us and they
basically talked about our story how we
started on YouTube all the different
struggles that we went through and what
it kind of did for us in our life so I'm
really interested interested to read the
article
like they even talk about the time I
found my birth father internet fame

because fans reached out Detroit down
the TV personality who reunites family
an aspiring singer Brian is at work on
an album we're definitely having more

Oh
sharing my story helped me heal and I'm
so glad it's helped others this is a
great article I know to be and nice they
did say we have 1.4 million subscribers
but we actually have 1.7 now so yeah if
your subscriber to People magazine or
you're not you can go check it out it's
on newsstands now if you see it take a
picture of yourself with it and tweet it
to me because I think it's amazing we've
always loved People magazine and it's
seriously an honor to get featured by
them so thank you guys all right Ollie
is eating some lunch
Finn is actually down for a nap and I
have been working on quite a few
different projects today I've got a lot
to get done before this weekend which is
his big birthday party so I have to
clean up all this birthday stuff which
I'm kind of sad to do I kind of like
leaving it up is because it's colorful
and fun but we're doing a different
theme for his party so which I'm sure
you can guess the theme we are doing
dinosaurs and I am making my own
dinosaur eggs out of these water
balloons I think I found it on Pinterest
but basically you just put a dinosaur or
a little treat of whatever your kid
likes into a balloon and then you fill
the balloon with water and then you
freeze it and then when you're done you
peel off the balloon and it makes a
little dinosaur egg what's in there oh
yeah dinosaur yeah these ones are frozen
and they got a we got to take the
balloon off and they look like little
dinosaur eggs and then they'll have to
basically melt the ice or break the ice
in order to get the Dicer out so I'm
really excited about it so I've been
filling all these up which is not an
easy task to do like my fingers hurt so
bad so I'm like pulling it open and
trying to stuff it and I'm doing myself
too which is easier to do with another
person but since Bryan's not here I got
to do it myself but I only have three
balloons left so I'm going to fill these
and hopefully that's enough
got quite a few all right hi my little
chickens how are you doing I'm gonna try
and clean this up today we got to make
sure it's ready so that people chickens
they can but if you guys are wondering
we never got see two other silkie
chickens we still have these three
that's breelan that in susan i don't
know why i just time to have kept going
by and now i'm nervous because they're
so much bigger and i don't want to get
like chicks because they're older and
they're like a pack now and I'm kind of
like I'm happy with these three so I'm
like why I messed up getting two more
and risk having like issues again I did
really want soaky's because I hear
they're really good with kids and stuff
but I'm gonna wait on that especially
cuz always got his kitten now so we'll
wait on more chickens but these guys are
happy they're healthy and they're doing
good so we're gonna clean out their cage
my dad's helping me out we're gonna put
them in the dog crate and get it all
cleaned up
come here little um Susan who wants to
come to me first coming okay I'm
definitely gonna need two hands I think
oh okay hi guys you can put the chicken
in here with breathe hey chickies looks
like we've turned your house into a
mobile home we've decided that it is
time to move them out of the garage and
outside now their coop area is not set
up and not ready yet but I'm going to
move them outside on the back porch that
way they can have the run of this entire
thing and they can be outside rather
than in a garage which is not reality
they are going to be living outside and
I think it will be fun to actually have
them like in the back yard with us
instead of always in the garage which is
kind of annoying and it's stinky
actually and they get stuff everywhere
so I think it'll be really nice to have
them out in the backyard
I'm excited so we've turned their home
into a mobile home and we're moving them
out yes it's time to go my dad's a
genius like look at it like it doesn't
fit here let me just do this now like
