at least four minutes late and he's
still not in his swimsuit so I'm really
really upset and I hate being late and
I'm totally late and he hasn't done swim
in a while so it's kind of a bummer kind
of mad but it's basically been like
every single red light that possibly
could happen has happened to me oh the
joys of beta software I am updating my
OS 10 Yosemite I'm running the beta
version on my iMac and I'm trying to get
it all up to date because I really want

headphones I don't know why but I have
two more boxes I gotta figure out what
to put in all right guys I just got a
swim and I'm so bummed I didn't vlog any
of it which is seriously a bummer
basically because I'm so late the cost
was like only
fifteen minutes long or something like
that for the first like five minutes he
cried the whole time I don't know why
exactly
we're definitely gonna need to get back
in the pool and get uncomfortable again
because I feel like we've taken such a
large break which I mean not that long
break but he definitely just got a
little bit freaked out like he didn't
want to be away from me and he didn't
really want to be in the water it was
really weird I'm kind of bummed about it
but definitely swimming in our pool
today
cuz he's not too happy with me you guys
I'm sorry I had to do it I just had to
do it okay we just did the ice bucket
challenge over on Missy's channel so go

off from his nap and we decided we need
go swimmin like I said earlier he's just
been a little bit more skittish of the
pool which is really weird cuz he's
always been like in love with the pool

last week just before we left for
Seattle cleaned out my entire trunk and
I had probably a hundred blank DVDs and

never gonna use those and now it's
really just come to bite me in the butt

and it's kind of nice I kind of needed
the breaker thing but I want to take a
second to talk to you guys about Hulu
Plus as you guys know we are actually
sponsored by them we actually really
like Hulu Plus and even though we just
recently got dish we still watch Hulu
Plus quite often because obviously the
cool thing is that you can watch full
seasons instead of like just one episode
so we've been catching up on Arrested
Development and actually this show no
ordinary family that came out a long
time ago I don't think there's very many
seasons but I watched a couple episodes
I was like I missed the show and
obviously the really cool thing also is
that you can watch it on your iPhone
your iPad your computer and your Smart
TV anything like that and it's just
really easy and accessible so I have a
link in the description and on the
screen that you can get two weeks free
if you sign up today
it's Hulu Plus calm such daily bumps the
reason we keep promoting this is because
we actually still get told all the time
like thank you so much for the free two
week and it's nice because it helps us
out helps you guys out you guys get two
freaks two three weeks and you're not
obligated to click it whatsoever if you

think they're venus flytraps is what
they call them venus flytraps lead
insects to their death by the scent in
color inside each trap when an insect
lands inside the trap it's that's on a
trigger hair the trap waits for the prey
to touch the hair a second time then
closes catching the insect it won't open
again until the insect is digested
several days later
oh and it's a killer plant busy hey I
think she got one hopefully doesn't need
to be alive it might need to be alive
