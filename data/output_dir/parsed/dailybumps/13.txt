- To Disney!
- Yay!
-  Yay! Disney!
We're gonna climb that
mountain together, buddy.
You and I are going on the bobsled.
(upbeat pop music)
(steady dance music)
- We're going to Disneyland!
- That is right!
We are taking both the boys to Disneyland.
Both boys are getting
(ding)
the most amazing nap ever.
Oh! Is that, is that a wake face?
(Missy whispers)
Finn's just started opening his eyes.
Oh hi Finn!
- Hi!
-  How was your nap?
- Good.
-  Good?
Are you digging for treasure?
- Yeah.
(Bryan laughs)
- Finn is awake and we are literally about
to pull into Disneyland.
Yeah Ollie's still, oh! There's Ollie.
Oh hey Ollie!
- I told them if they
want to go to Disneyland
they have to take naps.
-  Yes.
- And they did.
(Bryan laughs)
- I haven't actually been to
Disneyland in a while, too.
So I'm really excited.
- Me neither. I mean,
how long has it been?
We didn't, we missed all Christmas.
- We did miss Christmas
this year.
- Almost all Halloween stuff.
- Yeah. We had a really busy holiday.
- Yeah.
- So we did not
find ourselves at Disney that much.
But we are headed there
now and so excited!
Hey Ollie! You ready to go to Disney?
-  Yeah!
-  What do you see Finn?
(Finn babbles)
Really?
- Yeah!
(Finn yells)
-  We're going to Disney!
(Bryan laughs)
Whenever we go to Disney
and the kids fall asleep
they must be hyped up and
the best way to do that
is to play Disney music in the
car as we're about to park.
-  Yeah!
-  So we've got
a little Moana on now
to put the kids in the Disney spirit.
- To Disney!
- Yay!
-  Yay! Disney!
They're all Disney'ed out
in their Mickey shirts.
You ready to go have some fun?
-  You have a good nap?
- Yeah.
-  You gonna be able
to party all night long?
-  Oh! You found M&M's?
- Yeah.
-  The party's
just begun for this one.
Let's go boys!
Missy's rockin' Woody!
And we are now headed into Disneyland!
(dance music)
So Missy was just telling me
this is the first time that
Finn has been to Disneyland
since he turned two.
-  Yep.
- He hasn't been since his birthday.
-  Yeah. He was one
- That's crazy.
- the last time he went to Disneyland.
- Yeah so it's probably gonna be like
a whole new world for him
which is awesome.
- He's just changed
so much in the last
like four months that this
is gonna be so fun for him.
- Yeah.
And that's what's awesome
about taking your kids
to Disneyland is they
experience more of it
as they get older, so.
- There's so much for
Ollie to still experience,
it's crazy.
-  Yeah.
- There's so much for me to experience.
- Seriously. We have
still yet to do it all.
Isn't that crazy babe?
- Yeah! We have yet to do it all.
- I don't think we've still done it all.
(Bryan laughs)
(Finn yells)
-  So cool!
(dance music)
First things first
we had to grab these boys some sweatshirts
'cause it's actually a little chilly.
Are you Mickey?
(Bryan laughs)
These are actually really cool.
- I'm Mickey!
(Bryan laughs)
(boys play fighting)
-  The battle of the Mickeys!
(Bryan laughs)
(in Mickey voice) Oh
hey there, little boy!
- Why do you have Mickey ears?
- Because you had Mickey ears
and I wanted to be cool
like you guys.
(Finn babbles)
-  These are so cute!
I like these.
- Yeah, so we found a hat.
You like that hat?
Did you just hear him say that?
- Yeah.
-  I think he said,
"I like that hat, daddy."
That was so, so cute.
Oh and look at your ears!
(Finn babbles)
Yeah, you got yours out now?
Where are your ears, babe?
- I need ears!
- Missy is missing her ears, you guys.
What?
(prolonged whoop)
(Bryan laughs)
- Ollie, what ride do
you want to go on first?
(Ollie babbles)
Yes! Going on Buzz Lightyear.
Definitely my ears are a little droopy.
There we go. I'm gonna need
like some tape or something.
(Finn exclaims)
They're so happy!
-  Whoa!
-  Climb on, let's go, let's go!
To Buzz Lightyear away!
- Finn, do you want to
go on Buzz Lightyear?
- Yeah!
(playful dance music)
-  You see Buzz Lightyear?
(Finn babbles)
(enchanted music)
-  Alright, we just
got all our food for dinner
and one thing we want to do...
(Ollie exclaims)
I do have a BB-8 cup!
One thing we love to do when
we are out to eat as a family
is we love to cheers.
The boys really like it, too.
Alright, Disneyland!
-  Cheers!
-  Love you boys!
You having fun?
(Bryan laughs)
(Finn exclaims)
It's BB-8!
He yells at me if I forget
to take a drink after.
(Bryan laughs)
-  Cheers!
(Bryan laughs)
-  Whoa! That pizza
slice is bigger than his head.
- This is longer than my head.
-  Almost, yep.
(BB-8 electronic noises)
Alright, we may have gone crazy
at The Star Trader.
Look what Missy got!
- It's so cute! It's Porg!
-  They're Porg
backpacks. Turn around, babe.
Let me seem him.
Oh hey! It's a Porg.
- It actually has a
surprisingly large like pocket
to put stuff, so I've
got like diapers and.
-  Nice.
- Everything I need.
- And I am all decked out
for Mickey's Galactic Empire.
Check out this cool
sweatshirt I've got on.
I'm like so comfy now.
- I know I had to get
something warmer, too.
And this is really cute.
-  Oh yeah, it does look good babe.
Alright Ollie, are you ready
to ride the bobsleds?
- Yeah!
- I haven't been
on this ride in so long
and it's so much fun.
- Me either!
- You have never been on it, have you?
- No!
- And Ollie is now big enough for it
so we are going to ride the bobsled.
- Yeah!
- And we might even see, we might even see
an abominable snowman, okay?
- Yeah.
If I see I can tell you that is in it.
- Okay, you warn me if you see him, okay?
- Okay.
(enchanted dance music)
- How do you get on it?
-  We gotta go up it.
We're gonna climb that
mountain together buddy.
You and I are going on the bobsled.
That's so exciting, huh?
(Bryan laughs)
I am so excited. This is such a fun ride.
I cannot, I still can't believe
Ollie's even big enough for this.
You did?
- Yeah I watched a video
and last time it's BB.
- Oh, okay.
- He's prepared. He watched the video.
Wow!
Look at that you guys, it looks awesome.
(steady guitar)
(enchanted music)
- So, oh Ollie it's okay buddy!
(Bryan laughs)
He's so sad! It's okay.
Hey, it's okay. Come here.
Alright, so it turns out
Ollie is not tall enough
for the bobsled ride.
I thought he was, I
seriously thought he was 42.
And on the other one it
kinda looked like it,
so, he's okay right?
See, we're still having fun, right?
And all we gotta do is, what?
Get a little bit bigger and stronger,
eat all your veggies so you get taller
and then you and I will ride
the bobsleds together, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
He was so bummed, I felt so bad.
I really thought he was tall enough.
I'm sorry, we're gonna
go ride another fun ride.
What ride do you want to ride instead?
(Ollie babbles)
Okay, let's go ride Alice, okay?
Okay.
I think the culprit has been found,
it's your shoes!
- Oh! He's like so close!
-  I know!
- He must've been wearing different shoes.
-  I think he was!
Aww!
- It's okay.
-  Almost there, buddy!
You're almost there,
show me your big muscles.
Show me your big muscles,
you need big muscles
you go big and strong, alright?
- Yeah!
-  And Finn just threw
our stroller into the road.
Finn, you're silly.
(Fin exclaims)
- Okay, so the lady saw
that you were so sad
and she gave us some really cool passes.
So she gave you a pass that you can use,
go right into Peter Pan right now
and you don't have to wait
in the hour long line.
-  Oh!
- And she gave you something else.
She gave you a pass that you can use
on any other ride any time tonight.
-  Aww!
- And he actually is for sure big enough
for Guardians of the Galaxy
or the race car one, which is so fun!
-  In Cars Land, Ollie.
Remember that one?
- That one's like my favorite.
Have you been on that one?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
-  Alright Ollie, so you wanna go
on the Radiator Springs Racers?
- Yeah.
-  And guess what,
you're tall enough for that one!
So let's go on that.
-  It's a 90-minute
wait so we can go on it right now.
-  Oh let's go, Ollie!
Let's do it!
- I stopped crying!
-  Yes you did.
I'm proud of you.
Let's go have fun, k?
-  K.
(Bryan laughs)
-  Finn's like "k,
I'd like to go on a ride too, please."
- Yeah.
(Bryan laughs)
(upbeat music)
- Alright so Ollie has decided
that he wants to go on
Space Mountain, right buddy?
-  Yeah!
- Yeah! And you're gonna be
right there with me, okay?
- Is it the one that has stars in it?
- It has lots of stars, yeah.
- Really?
- You're like in the space.
- Does that sound good?
- Hi daddy!
- Hi Finn!
- It's really really
fast, and it's super dark.
-  Are you okay with that?
- Is it scary?
-  It's not scary.
- Alright, we'll see how this goes.
(Finn wails)
- I thought I was gonna throw up and fall.
-  Aww!
I don't understand, he had so much fun.
He hung onto me the whole time.
He was like, I thought he was loving it
and then we got off
the ride, and he was...
- He got to like, sit with you?
-  Yeah, yeah he got
to sit right next to me.
- So you don't want to
go with momma right now?
-  No? Okay.
- Okay, we'll wait 'till
-  It's okay.
- You're a little bigger.
- But you did good.
-  You did really good dude!
- I'm proud of you.
-  I'm so proud of you.
That's pretty brave.
- He really wanted to
go on a big-kid ride.
-  Yeah.
(Bryan laughs)
- You did it.
Good job.
-  He did it.
My kid just did Space Mountain.
That's crazy.
Oh hey Finn, what are you eating?
Pez?
- Yeah! BB!
-  Oh!
BB-8 Pez?
- Yeah!
-  Nice!
Alright guys, I hope you had fun.
We had so much fun at
Disneyland, didn't we buddy?
- Yeah.
