It has been a rough, rough morning.
Would you say so, Finley Jay?
- Yeah
- Yeah
- I'm going to school
and Finn just be crazy.
- Crazy (laughs).
- That is basically the truth.
Finn hasn't been feeling that great
and so he had a rough night
and then this morning was rough
and we did not get up for school in time
and so now we're running late.
And then usually I leave Finn
because taking Finn to
like, drop off Ollie
would be kind of a long process.
And I could not leave.
Could not leave.
I feel like at this
point we're like so late
that I should just skip.
But I really want Ollie to get to school,
they're learning a really
cool letter this week
and I don't want him to miss out on that.
And so, I put Finn in the car.
I might actually drop him
off with my mom and dad
since it's on the way,
and then he can play
and not feel like I abandoned him.
'Cause that is what he
was making me feel like.
Bryan's actually getting
ready to head out on a trip.
So he was really busy and
couldn't really, like,
take care of Finn.
- Wait, what kind of trip?
Finn is in need of like,
some major cuddles, so.
- What kind of trip?
- He's going on a guys trip.
(cheering)
We have hopefully a fun
day planned for these boys.
We just gotta get through this
morning and get to school.
All right, are we ready for school?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Lets go.
Ollie, you're late,
you're late, you're late.
For a very important date, huh?
You're never late to school.
- Are you just kidding me?
-  No you really are late.
I think it'll be okay.
Bye baby, love you.
- Bye.
- Have a good day.
All right, I just dropped off Ollie.
And he was so cute.
He was late and they were actually doing
circle time at the time
and it was the first time
that I'd seen all his friends
get all excited to see him
and they were all like "Ollie,
Ollie come sit next to me".
And it was just so cute.
It's just fun to know
that your kid fits in
and has friends at school.
I am now though, headed probably to Finn.
I do have a horse-riding lesson today.
But I just want to make
sure Finn is doing good
before I head there.
I did want to say, I'm riding,
I'm wearing my horsey jacket
that I bought a few weeks ago.
At like, a horse sale.
And I love this jacket.
And I've worn it quite a few times.
It's very like, easy to like, ride in
'cause it gives you lots of movement.
It's not like a jacket.
But it's also super warm.
But I realized today,
It smells.
It literally smells like horse.
But not like, good horse.
Kind of like, stinky poopy horse.
I'm like ew, I need to wash it.
So yeah, I probably
smell like a horse today.
But I don't really care
'cause I love horses.
I am off to go check on Finn
and make sure he's doing good.
So I am at Mimi and Papa's
and I was looking everywhere for Finn,
but he's not here.
Leo, what'd you do with him?
He's like don't talk to
me about that crazy kid.
I guess he was actually
in such a good mood,
that my dad ended up taking
him to go have some fun
and go do some stuff.
So, I'm scarfing down some
banana and peanut butter.
That's a lot of peanut butter,
I don't think I'm gonna eat all that.
And then I'm headed up to go
do my horse riding lesson,
which Finn might actually come up
and hang out for a
little bit but we'll see,
'cause my dad has him right now.
I'm just gonna finish this up,
get some protein in my body
before I go work on my
horse for the next hour.
Hi Nacho.
Did you have a good day?
I'm actually down here at the barn
and Papa brought Finn by.
He was so excited because
he found his Frankenstein
and he's been hanging out,
watching a little YouTube Kids.
Trying to relax, while
Mama has been working.
Oh my gosh, my hair is a mess.
How are you doing?
Are you happy?
That's how he's doing.
He had a fun time with Papa,
and then he decided to
come on down and hang out.
But, yeah, I think I'm
actually gonna head out now.
And go get Ollie and
we're all alone today.
So, daddy's not here, huh?
- Yeah.
- Did daddy go?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I am home now and look who's here.
Auntie's here
- Hey, what's going on?
- And when Finn is grumpy
and not feeling good,
he gets whatever he wants,
which means Rice Krispies Treats cereal.
I've had this in my cupboard for months
and we've never opened it.
I was actually giving it
to my sister and he saw it
and he was like, "I want some of that".
So, how is it Finn?
- Ball.
- Good, oh, ball.
Are you watching something on
- He's playing a ball game.
- Oh, you're playing a game.
- Yeah.
- Wow.
- Are you still happy you got Auntie?
(laughs)
- Yeah, and we are having some salad.
And my mom and dad were nice
enough to pick up Ollie for me,
so he will be here any minute.
He's going to be so excited
that Auntie is here.
So yeah, we're excited, huh?
Are you starting to get into a good mood?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
-  Welcome home.
And who's here.
Are you so excited that Auntie's here?
- Yeah.
-  Was it fun having
Mimi and Papa pick you up too?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Hey Ollie, should we do
something fun with Auntie today?
- Yeah.
- What should we do?
Should we take her somewhere fun?
- Go to the park?
- Yeah.
- That'd be cool?
Yeah.
All right, we're outside
enjoying the weather.
It is so like, cool out today.
- It's like the perfect
kind of chilly weather.
-  I know.
- It's too cold for the pool, guys.
-  Yeah, the pool
is just a little cold, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Are you riding
your Strider Bike?
- No, it's actually a
motorcycle but a toy motorcycle.
- Oh, a toy motorcycle.
Well, there you go.
-  I got you that bike.
- Yup.
- When you were two.
- When you were two years old.
- Now you're using it.
- Yeah and I had it but.
Now I'm four.
- Yep, all right, show me how fast you go.
Look at that motorcycle.
Show me how fast you go, Auntie.
They're crazy, huh?
- Was that cool guys?
-  So cool.
- Was that cool guys?
-  Yep
-  What did you say?
- The chick lay eggs.
-  Okay, let us know.
- Usually they lay eggs in this one.
-  Oh, in this one?
- Yeah.
One egg.
-  One egg, good job.
- I think there's another egg guys.
-  Okay, lets keep looking.
They don't normally lay in this one, huh?
Oh my gosh.
They did huh?
We need our egg thing,
you wanna go get it?
The egg apron.
Karma, No.
- No, he's trying to put the bone in.
-  Let's see if any are in here.
Nope, none in there.
All right, lets go get our egg apron
so we can go get our eggs, okay?
- Okay.
-  Look who's wearing the apron now
- Ollie with the mustache
(laughs)
-  All right,
lets go get your eggs.
Come on Finny.
All right, he's getting
his eggs in his apron.
Good job, bud.
- Big one.
-  Oh my gosh, you
have so many eggs there.
How many eggs do you have?
- One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
-  Seven?
Wow.
- Chicken
-  You hear the chicken?
- Yeah.
- Wow.
So we are actually on our own today,
if you guys don't know it,
Bryan is off on a little trip.
And so we're on our own, huh?
- Yeah.
- Daddy left us, but
he'll be back soon, huh?
Yeah.
(upbeat music)
Go Ollie, go.
Go Ollie, go.
You're so good at that.
When did you get so good
at riding your bike?
Oh my gosh.
-  Go get them.
Oh God, Oh God.
Someone's gonna get hurt.
-  Auntie, I'm calling
Auntie's getting hurt.
- She dropped her phone.
-  Oh she dropped her phone.
- Auntie, you dropped your phone.
-  Oh my gosh, the gate is open,
Finley Jay.
(laughs)
Oh my gosh, got her.
She dropped her phone.
(laughs)
Oh my gosh.
Auntie just saved Finn
from leaving the yard.
-  The pressure
plates are awfully white.
-  I know, he
just like rides over it
and the gates open.
Auntie, did you just save his life?
- I saved his life, I
definitely saved his life.
I think I even scrapped my hands a bit,
but they're just black I think.
And my new shoes.
-  And what was he doing?
- He was going and then as
soon as he saw the gate open,
he hit the gas as hard as he could
and looked at me like,
"Oh yeah, I'm gonna go".
- Oh my gosh.
- I'm grabbing him and he
was still pressing the gas
as I was pulling him backwards.
- Oh my gosh.
He's never done that, like for us.
He was like, he knew you were like--
- I think it's because he
saw that I was chasing him,
so he decided it was like a game almost.
- Oh, that little stinker.
Papa is yelling at him now.
-  I think he
just made a road block.
- Oh yeah, you guys have to play up here.
You crazy boy.
All right, we've got road
blocks and we've got gloves.
- I'm ready
-  And we are ready.
- Oh, Finn.
- It's like what, you think
I'ma go down that hill?
- I like hill.
- Down the hill.
- Go Finn.
- You gonna go down the hill?
- Yeah.
- Go.
- Are you, let's see if he pushes.
-  Go.
- Oh my gosh, he really done it.
Good thing we put it in reverse.
-  Go.
Ollie, who's here now?
- Carl and Ginger.
- Well, just Ginger.
(laughs)
Not Carl.
Carl is with Bryan.
But we've got the boys here
and Ollie and Finn are so excited.
They got here pretty late
so it is this one's bedtime.
It's actually Ollie's bedtime too
but I'm gonna let him stay up and play.
Finn on the other hand, is
just having a rough day.
I think I'm gonna have him go night night.
So, I'm trying something a
little bit different tonight.
Look at the room I'm in.
I haven't been in here
in many, many months.
He does sleep really good with Ollie.
But one, the last few
nights he's been getting up
a lot and he just hasn't
been sleeping very well.
Two we've got a lot of company over,
so I was gonna put him to bed in here.
So I've got his sound machine set up.
And his camera and got
his little bed in here.
He's like I'm turning this off
because I'm not sleeping in here mom.
But I'm so excited to rock
him in the rocking chair.
I haven't rocked him in so long.
This whole room is just so bare
'cause we've taken a lot of it and put it
in their now, other room.
And this I've been
meaning to move this out
so I can measure them.
I need to do that.
But yeah, I'm gonna try
to put this one to bed,
but I'm not gonna tell him.
All right, the boys are all in bed.
I got Finn to sleep.
- Our eyes are reflective.
- I know, we've got like,
our little patches right now.
- So we look like swan you guys.
- When the boys are away, it's girl time.
- Holla.
- So yeah, we have these
on and they're like,
de-puffing our eyes.
And hopefully making all
of the wrinkles go away.
- Wrinkles?
We do not have wrinkles, ew.
- We've got Finn asleep.
Ollie and Carl are trying to fall asleep.
- They're talking a lot.
- Yeah, they're just all so cute.
But yeah, we're finally
gonna sit down and relax.
And actually we're getting
ready to start a new show
that is coming out on NBC,
it started tonight for us
and it's called Rise
and my cousin is in it.
And he's actually like,
he's got a good part in it.
He's not just like a side
character, he's there.
- Which is really cool.
- Yeah, maybe he is like a side character
but he's not like an extra.
Like he's there, like he's in the show.
- He's an actual character.
- He's in the cast.
- I'm excited to watch it.
- So I'm so excited to start it,
I think it's gonna be really fun.
So if you guys haven't
checked it out, Rise.
Go watch.
And my cousin Keith is in there.
I'm so excited.
Anyways, we're gonna end the video,
make sure you give it a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Bye.
I'm a unicorn.
