just really special and it really just
talks about Oliver and the pregnancy and
it's a really nice song and but I'll
have a link in the description

belly but now we got a baby and no belly

being gone is it weird feeling is that
like it is still a very slight numbness
but I can tell it's all the way back

bigger than it is it red it's not ready
thank you only know that's staples in it

you tell you guys but they pulled out my
entire uterus to look at it could he's

just like what the heck and like taking
pictures of it yeah so yeah we'll see if
we can track down a picture to show you

bigger is cuz they wanted more room to
pull every yeah how including my uterus
okay who's been sleeping very good very
very good do you guys see he has these
cute little white speckles do you guys
see them I guess it's one of the three
rashes that newborns get and this is
just one of them it's completely normal
but it's so cute and I'm just like I
want it to stay there because it gives
them so much character

resting together while we're waiting for
Brian to get back tonight we actually
decided to have my sister stay because
me and Brian are so tired that like
especially with our nervousness I'm just
like I can't tend to sleep deeply sleep
and relax
especially if Brian's relaxed because
I'm just even though he is swaddled and
in a bassinet I
just get nervous about him not there's
someone just not keeping an eye on him
you know it's just like that new parent
nervousness feelings so we decided to
have a third person it'll take some
shift so we could get some better sleeps
I can't even believe how like beautiful
and perfect he is he's just amazing and
Cassie saw him sucking his thumb and I
haven't seen it yet but I was like what
she's like I didn't know it's a big deal

cannot wait to go home and start taking
care of him and he knows the hold hands
every single time I open my laptop I get
to look at this picture now is not
amazing this is like the most adorable
picture of him ever do you see this cuz
it's so hard in all the pictures we take
