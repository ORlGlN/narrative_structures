good morning you guys you know what just
makes the morning even extra better
eating candy disguises vitamins this is
our son baby boy is gonna do amazing
things
nom king these are actually vitamins but
they're so good these are these by
diffusion ones and they're like sour
gummy and they're so good okay I'm
tweaking I waked up Dora again Paula oh
also I'm trying a new scent a new Old
Spice scent this is a bear glove and it
says that it's for the commanding man so
mainly douchebags but I like the smell
of it smells pretty good and this he
actually brought to my attention cuz
smells like watermelon it actually does
kind of smell like a musky watermelon
type thing which is interesting but what
else I'm going with it today is also the
day that we say goodbye to the PS triple
we say our farewells you know I had a
lot of fun on this thing got my PS
triple even got the headsets which I
actually hated these these things were
horrible and now that the ps4 you can
plug in headphones right into the
controller and listen to your stuff
basically has replaced that so I am
getting rid of the ps3 all my
controllers this and look at all these
games I've accumulated you guys this is
like in seven months I've accumulated
all these games and I don't know I'm
just
I really love the ps4 and I don't see
myself ever gaming on the ps3 the only
thing that I really wanted to play on
the ps3 was Kingdom Hearts because I
love this game when I was in school but
they're making a brand new Kingdom
Hearts for ps4 so I'll probably just get
that one I love the ps3 it was a ton of
fun but now that I've upgraded I kind of
just don't see the point anymore and
it's basically like cash just cash
sitting on my TV thing so I'm going to
go into Game Stop and trade this all in
because they're having like a special
where you get
even more percent for all your stuff so
we'll see what they give me and be able
to buy some cool ps4 games with it well
hey there guys getting ready to make
myself some lunch
Ollie is done for a nap he's giving me a
bit of a struggle today I'm really just
not wanting to take his nap and being
kind of grouchy so not sure what's going
on but I need food so I'm making myself
some chicken and of course macaroni and
cheese I know it's funny and Gary the
procession for the PS triple has
officially begun I am on my way to
gamestop but I don't know if you guys
heard but there's like these huge fires
just roaring through the Fallbrook and
Riverside area and it's kind of close to
where we are but actually it's really
really close to my family because you
know ever since I found my long-lost
birth father if you guys don't know
about that then go watch those vlogs but
I have like this whole family now who's
sort of in that area but they're all
saved they've told me that the fires are
basically a way enough that they don't
have to worry yet and hopefully that
stays the same oh and also I know a lot
of people have been asking about the
barbecue we did plan a BBQ at the
beginning of May for everyone to like to
meet me and there was a new baby being
born in the family and there are people
gonna be up like in town who didn't live
in town so we're playing this huge
barbecue but not enough people could go
I guess and basically my dad couldn't
even go so we had to cancel it and we're
hoping to be able to do something really
big in the middle of the summer because
I still have like a ton of family that I
had yet to really meet you know what I
mean so I got to meet my birth father
and his whole family that was awesome
but I know there's like even more to
come which is which is really really
exciting so we're just waiting on that
and and making sure that everyone
schedules on everyone like works these
crazy schedules you know so we're just
trying to line it up perfectly so
everyone can be involved and hopefully
it doesn't intervene with VidCon or like
vlogger fair anything because we've
already got a pretty busy summer ahead
of us so I'm eating my lunch and we're
also watching the news
and it's crazy right now huge fires
going on in Southern California if you
don't know what's going on there's like
three different fires I think there's
one actually what is it like 30 miles
from us about 30 miles and then there's
one a little bit further and then
there's another one it's like they're
all like in San Diego it's crazy they're
just dirt flying so high and the wind's
get a little bit crazy out here and
start pushing it around it's kind of
scary at we're totally fine we're
totally safe I think it could even come
over here because there's like so many
hills and stuff it would be like nearly
impossible nice you guys that was a huge
success I got 268 dollars in store
credit so I'll basically probably never
pay for a ps4 game for at least the rest
of the year now I'm gonna go get my pan
on whenever the summer season hits it
just the fires go crazy out here you are
in that area make sure you're keeping
safe and watching the news and stuff
like that now I'm watching some guy get
hair transplant it's really gross pop ah
community fans are now mourning
everywhere
check that out you guys that's all the
smoke from the fire we can see it right
over these hills that is crazy I can't
imagine what it's like try like having
your house burned to the ground like
that would just be
devastating how does just Rena tweet at
the red light to that Heidi while they
were napping posted I guess they've
already evacuated 15,000 homes
that's like 15,000 families like forced
to leave their home because of a fire
that could potentially destroy it
that's just crazy I think we're okay
though I think we're far enough away
from the fire that it's not going to
really affect us but man the smoke
clouds that are coming from over that
mountain are just billowing it's crazy
to see good mr. Olli he is you can run
the camera now he's filming - look who's
vlogging and he's doing her really
really good dude daddy's over there I've
had as well yeah never move up here you
go you actually have it all locked so he
can press it and son yeah so he can like
do stuff on it but he can't really do
anything and he's doing really good it's
all good yeah he's over there dancing
he's over there dancing playing music
all he thinks it's hilarious
oh we hanging out chilling after Sami
chill working is you're freaking cute he
is right now I know I actually did out
to debate whether or not this was a girl
outfit or not it was in the boys suck I
know but it's just so pink and girly
pink it's just not a girly I am cleaning
out all his clothes I just pick out all
of those and now they're all down there
basically all that was six months like
jammies and six-month onesies which were
long sleeves all these ones were long
sleeves we're gonna save those in case
we have another boy yep of course a lot
of you asked me what I'm doing I'm
obviously if I have another boy I'm
gonna get my mom so once hey that's not
really but I'll just say like those are
not worn at all we are out running
some errands we actually do got a call
from Carter's on Mother's Day after we
left because she had forgot to put a
couple of outfits in the bag so she's
like don't worry about it just come down
here anytime and pick them up it sounds
like okay cool so we're gonna go pick up
those and but we also found on our
receipt we have like thirty dollars that
we get to just go and spend we don't
have to spend anything to get that $30
$20 off $30 yeah so I'm really excited I
think we're just going to grab a couple
more outfits grab the stuff we already
bought and head down there it's pretty
cool um but he just had probably one of
our first major meltdowns with Oliver
like it was like a major meltdown in the
store and I don't think I've ever had to
like do something like that right yeah
it was pretty gnarly he was really upset
he's so upset but luckily he's fine now
I actually had to like literally start
nursing him in the middle of store which
is unusual for him because he normally
does not like to her like doesn't need
to nurse it doesn't like to nurse but he
was just like I was like alright here's
my boob and I started like walking
around the store nursing him but he was
like thank you and he seemed really
happy with that now whatever floats his
boat
you want to boo that's my baby look at
this cutie you look just like the hangar
ha that's what you're wearing
which button all right cool simple shirt
I like that one is it feels cool to
who's nice couple little t-shirts cool
t-shirt yeah that 30 bucks oh yeah
Oliver always look so cute in his little
Finding Nemo hooded cowl behind anymore
hats but we let you put this hood on you
oh look at him he's already pulling it
down like no thank you just got a bath
he's all clean no I'm too good today
no he pretty much threw up everywhere at
the dining room table yeah I don't know
in my thing cuz there was something that
is throat okay he was choking but he was
like kind of like he was like I'd like
so maybe something was just kind of like
in his sorrow and then just started like
coming out though yeah but he didn't
faze him at all he didn't even like cry
he was just like yeah he's not like I'm
happy or anything he's just a gravity
thig birthday trip again
that's me smell like puke yeah hey guys
I got only the bed I'm gonna say today
was a rough day with him I'm not sure
what was going on
maybe he's teething another tooth which
would be crazy because it already
actually has three and if he does
another one that would be ridiculous I
feel so bad
it was drooling a lot but he was just so
grouchy couldn't sleep not a happy boy
