-  Finn, what are you looking for?
- Water!
-  Water?
- Yeah.
- Say, thank you.
- Thank you, mama.
- I love you, Finn!
Wow!
And you're learning some new sword moves.
That's very cool, dude.
You're like a ninja.
Like a real-life ninja.
♫ This is our life
♫ This is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream
♫ This is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever!
- Good morning, my little Ghostbusters!
Are you a ghost buster today?
- No.
- And Finn is back to
being a marshmallow ghost.
I'm the ghostbuster guy.
 You are the ghostbuster guy.
Are you getting him?
- Yeah, I have claws.
-  Yeah.
They have been playing all morning,
and they've been loving
their ghostbuster costumes.
They actually have so many costumes now
that, like, whatever they
wanna be, they can be.
(laughs)
It's pretty cute.
Yes, we're enjoying some
beautiful weather today.
It is literally so nice out.
It is just cool weather,
beautiful weather,
crisp weather...
Jump!
And I think this boy has a little poopy.
I better go change your bottom, huh?
Anyways, we're just enjoying this really,
really nice weather.
Getting some work done.
Planning to have a pretty fun day.
What should we do today, Ollie?
- Go to Peyt and Liv's.
- You always want to go
to Peyt and Liv's, huh?
- Yeah!
Alright, we'll see what
they're doing today, okay?
Boys are down for a quick, little nap.
Well, Finn's down for his nap,
and Ollie is doing probably
just a quick, little nap.
I got Elf on for the first
time this Christmas season,
because it is Christmas season right now.
Officially.
I haven't decorated yet,
but I am looking forward
to it really soon.
And, I've got cookies in the oven!
Yum!
I have been working off the
same batch for a few days now.
I made cookie dough and
I've just been making
like one little batch at a time.
And then we spend like a
couple days like eating these.
And they are so good!
They're like better if
you let the cookie dough
like sit in the fridge a little bit.
And then I've also got oatmeal cookies,
which is Bryan's, like
one of his favorites.
I really like cookie-- oatmeal too.
But, these ones are the best!
(happy, upbeat music)
- Oh, hey guys!
How is it goin?
I've been working in my office
a little bit this morning.
Cause it's Monday.
I had a bunch of emails,
but now I'm all done.
But I just realized, my wall
plant is not doing very well.
As you can see, this one down
here is just completely dead.
No matter how much I water it,
I just don't think it was doing well.
This one's doing really good.
That one's doing okay.
That one not so much.
And that one's doing good up there.
So, it's like, I could
probably take the ones
that are not doing very
good out and replace them.
But, I'm just like worried
about keeping up on this.
I think I'm gonna take this down.
Just get some nice shelves,
so I have a little bit more
storage for books and stuff.
I'm always changing out
my office I feel like.
I feel like it's almost
getting to the point
where it could be done.
And, you know what, maybe it's never done.
And maybe that's okay.
Maybe that's the point
of having your own home,
is it's never done.
It's kind of always in transition
and always getting better.
And that's okay, cause it's our home.
Hey, dude!
Come over here and give me a big, fat hug!
I love you.
- I love you, too.
- What are you doing?
- I was waking up from, from my--
- From your nap?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you had a good, little rest?
Yeah, the kids have been
getting such good rest lately.
- Let's go outside!
- Let's go outside.
It's a beautiful day!
Whoa, dude!
Look at those blue skies.
- Those are cotton candy skies.
- Cotton candy skies?
Aww, I don't see any cotton candy.
Just clouds.
Ollie always refers to the
clouds as cotton candy clouds,
regardless if they are
cotton candy clouds or not.
- Cotton candy!
- Yay!
I think our yard is actually
getting serviced right now.
They're like--
Oh, they're doing this.
They're fertilizing it,
cause we're trying to get
it super nice and green.
What's up?
- The guys that put these flags here
so Santa can bring his reindeer.
- That is right!
These flags are so that Santa
knows where to land, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, cause Santa's coming soon, dude.
Is he gonna come to our house?
- I think so.
He's gonna get our presents!
- You think so?
- Yeah.
- I don't know, what
if he doesn't show up?
That'd be sad, huh?
I'm sure he's gonna show up.
I'm sure he's gonna show up.
And you know he likes to dance
on our cameras every year, right?
- Really?
- Yeah, member?
We saw him.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Santa always like to come
and dance at our house.
I don't know why.
- Santa lives in the North Pole.
- Yeah, he lives in the North
Pole with all his elves.
How's that cookie, by the way?
That looks so good.
- Yeah, mom made it for me.
-  She did?
Well that's the best mom ever, huh?
- Such a nice day.
-  I know, right?
Yeah!
We are getting some good,
fall weather, you guys.
(lively music)
Whoa!
You circling the flag with that?
What is that by the way?
- It's from the old Christmas--
-  Oh, from your elf, right?
What's his name, Fred?
- Fred, yeah!
-  Yeah, he left this
here last year, didn't he?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
I wonder if he's going to do
anything with it this year?
Yeah, I guess we're just gonna
have to wait and see, huh?
Christmas is comin up, so we gotta see
if Ollie's elf on the
shelf is gonna come back.
And if Santa's gonna come.
It's gonna be a fun time, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Alright, let's go inside.
It's getting a little chilly.
There you go, dude.
(happy, upbeat music)
Alright, boys.
Mommy has a surprise for you.
You ready?
- Ahhh!
The boys have been cooped up all day,
so we thought we'd reward
them with something.
Which we got...
- We got...
Hatchimals!
- Yeah!
- Yay!
So these are the new Hatchimals Surprise.
Who will you hatch?
- And are they twins?
- I kind of think they're twins.
That's pretty cool.
- Ooh, that'd be so cool!
-  Alright.
- Here's the different kinds.
You could get this cute, little, blue one.
A pink and purple one.
-  Peacat, okay.
Or Giraven.
That's cool.
You want it out?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, I have
feeling you're going to
be saying that all night long.
These hatchimals will only open
if you show them lots of love
and take care of them, okay Ollie?
- Okay.
- You gotta take really,
really good care, okay?
-  Okay, Finn?
- Okay.
- I think this is a
case for the hatchimals.
- Yep, you gotta open it up.
Whoa!
Look at that huge egg, Finn!
He's so excited.
Whoa!
- Wow, it is really big!
-  Wow, alright you ready?
Alright, the boys got their eggs!
Are you guys so excited to start them?
- Yeah!
-  Yes!
Let's let the hatching commence!
-  Turn these and pull them out.
-  Oo, it's making noise!
Ooo.
Alright, that's your friend tonight.
Okay, Ollie?
Make sure you give it all
the love it needs, okay?
You hear it, Finn?
- Yeah.
-  Oh, look.
Look!
-  Do you hear them in there?
-  Oop, there it is.
Do you see?
-  Can you guys hear it?
There's something in there.
Ooh, I see it lighting up too.
See the cracks?
There's a couple of creatures
in these I think you guys.
I think you guys have two sets of twins.
That's exciting, huh?
Finn, you're making yours dizzy, dude.
(happy, upbeat music)
So the boys look situated in the play room
so they can cuddle with their eggs.
And look, they're lighting up!
See?
Ooh, is yours lighting up too?
Whoa, look!
They're lighting up, Finn!
Keep giving it love.
Give it a hug.
It's the only way it'll
hatch is if you give it love.
Ollie's got his blankie for it.
Here, Finn.
You can borrow some of Ollie's blankie
to keep it warm, okay?
And make sure to keep
tilting it and stuff, okay?
And playing with it.
They seriously love hatchimals so much.
It's so cute.
Ollie!
Your furry hatchimal is coming out.
Take it off!
Look at him!
Finn, what you got?
He just came out?
There's another one in there?
Whoa!
It came out from the top?
There's one in there still, Finn.
This is so cute!
Look it!
Aww, it's fluffy.
- Yeah, and different from the other kind.
But, like super cute.
-  Yeah!
Aww, look at that.
Ollie, you getting yours too?
Oh, get it Finn!
Get it!
Finn's gonna be such a good,
little daddy to his hatchimal.
Look at him, he's like, let it out.
Come on out, come on out!
There he is!
Whoa!
Here, let me see that one.
Oh, no!
- He got twins.
-  Twins!
That's four new hatchimal
babies for you guys.
-  Aww, look at these two twins.
-  Aww.
Aww, that's so cute.
-  Look how cute they are!
Ollie, you have to name them.
-  Well, hey guys.
What's up?
Look at them, dude.
They're looking at you.
Finn, look at your hatchimals.
They're so cute!
Yeah, you gotta name them, Finn.
Here's your other one.
- His children name is
Finn and the other Finn.
-  So, Finn and Finn?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, and what are your names?
- This one's name is Ollie
and that one's name is Ollie.
-  Oh, so these
are both named Ollie,
and these are both named Finn.
That's so cute.
- Baby Ollie #1 and Baby Ollie #2?
- Yeah.
- Okay, got it.
(upbeat music)
- They're hugging together.
-  Aww, they're hugging?
- So some of you may
know that a few days ago,
Luna ended up getting out of our yard
and running away.
And we thought that she had her collar on,
which she did, which of course
has her tags and everything,
but the tags had fallen off.
And we were so surprised and shocked
that that ever happened.
I don't know how that happened.
But basically, she didn't
have any of her identification
on her when she got lost,
and that's super scary.
So, obviously, first thing we want to do
is make sure she can't get lost again.
But second thing is to also
make sure that if she does,
someone can contact us if they get her.
(laughter)
We found this collar that has
where we put her name on it
and my phone number is on it as well.
And that way, when they find
her, they can easily call us.
And it's on her and it can't fall off,
unless her collar falls
off, which it won't.
But, at least we won't lose tags.
I'm really excited about this.
- It's on me.
-  You're wearing Luna's old one.
- A little scary.
Okay, let's get this on.
-  There ya go.
- Now you got your new collar!
Yay!
Look at her name!
-  Aww.
That's so cool.
(upbeat music)
-  Finn, what are you looking for?
- Water.
-  Water?
- Yeah.
-  Say, water.
- Water.
-  Say, water, please.
- Water, please.
-  Aww.
Say, thank you.
- Thank you, mama.
- I love you, Finn!
He's getting so big.
He usually just calls it wat'n wat'n--
or whatever.
But, he just said, wat-er.
Which is very cool.
What did you want to show us?
Wow.
And you're learning some new sword moves.
That's very cool, dude.
So cool.
You're like a ninja.
Like a real-life ninja.
Wow.
- I wanna call Liv and Pey.
- Hi, Ollie!
- Hi!
- What are you doing?
- We eating dinner.
-  How's it goin, Liv and Pey?
- Good!
-  Did you guys eat dinner already?
- We're eating it right now.
-  Oh, awesome!
What are you guys eating?
- Noodles.
-  And what?
- Garlic bread.
-  Yum, they're having
noodles and garlic bread.
Ol, you wanna show them what
you're eating for dinner?
Show them what you're eating.
- I'm eating--
(monster voice)
- Grilled cheese and oranges and chicken.
-  I don't know
why we started calling you
and he literally just
started acting crazy.
-  That's awesome.
-  Hey, tell them
what you opened today.
- I opened hatchimals!
-  You opened hatchimals?
- Yeah, let me show them.
-  So, dude, he's so excited.
Whoa!
- Oh, so pretty!
- They're twins!
-  Yeah, they both
have twins in their eggs.
(happy, upbeat music)
-  Santa's coming soon, dude.
Is he coming to our house?
