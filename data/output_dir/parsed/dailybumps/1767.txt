trait if I'd be oh oh it's going
everywhere you guys oh poor thing oh
poor thing I feel so bad oh that is not
pretty what did you eat babe okay
having a boy
good morning do you hear that sound yeah
I wake up every morning and it seriously
freaks me out and it's Missy's
humidifier because apparently Missy has
the soul of an 80 year old woman and so
she needs to have a humidifier I don't
know how she if this really does
anything really I don't know I mean it's
kind of warm I know you sure would have
humidifier supposed to do oh I just
showed all her nasty tissues and stuff
too cuz she's still not feeling too well
but she is headed to work and I am up
and moving around last night I noticed
on our main drive hard drive that holds
all our vlogs I have 19 gigabytes left
and it's only a terabyte it's only like
a portable external because I didn't
really know how far this was going to go
and so I really thought that was all I
needed at the time but now that I only
have 19 gigabytes available I'm starting
to freak out and I'm kind of thinking I
need to start preparing for the future
so I've been looking at Drobo's thinking
about getting one I found one close well
it's not really close by it's actually
in Hollywood which is like an hour and a
half away from us and it's a really nice
for bei hard drive system Drobo and it
comes with eight terabytes of hard
drives for 400 bucks I offered him it
really sucks I kind of regret it but I
offered him to trade for my iPad Mini
and he agreed I can a math I hate not
having an iPad I went without an iPad
for a couple months and it would just
kind of like drove me crazy but this is
pretty time-sensitive because I don't
want to start erasing data just because
I need the space amiss she's always like
well you know what we can save up for
another iPad but you can't really save
up for a deal like this because I really
can't find anything like it okay this is
the funniest thing sometimes we go
really long time without what we are
grass and then the guy who mows like all
the neighbors grasses he drops off
business cars and like comes up to talk
to us look there's my your grass okay
oh who we good talking like we don't
need our grass mom Carmen does not want
anymore guys what so I just got home and
this is my bedroom
chips empty wrapper food Brian what on
the head just ate lunch this is not
lunch okay so I had some gummy snacks
I'm five years old get over it anyways I
just got home and we are headed off to
an appointment which is normally a super
easy simple appointment that's just
right down the street but they didn't
have any appointments available right
down the street now I have to go 30 to
45 minutes out of our way but it is kind
of near the beach which might be nice
cuz maybe we can go to the beach and
maybe I can wear my cool new jacket
that's the beach jacket korma see she
got really not just on the car ride and
we're like supposed to be at the point
man at 2:45 but I'm pretty sure we're
gonna be late and she was all worried if
I'd be oh oh oh it's going everywhere
you guys oh poor thing oh poor thing I
feel so bad oh that is not pretty what
did you eat babe Oh Missy crap and you
gave her some water there's some water
and some napkins
oh of course don't how many napkins ha
ha ha ok we're back on the road that was
pretty much ridiculously gross that came
out really fast too like well this is a
winding road that we're driving right
now I was just kind of like sitting here
and I'm like oh my god I'm gonna puke
like right this liked it and I will
admit it's a little hard holding
everything back did you peel at all
you peed did you really I do oh my god
you have no control of your body at all
do you
it was not fun at all joys of being
pregnant not only was a puking but that
was happening I just wanted to cry and
I'm late it's probably pretty big ahh

better and better

baby hey Oliver seeing pre jealous right
now hey guys welcome to our second
edition of epic comment moment one way
oh we just started this where we're
gonna start going through your comments
every Wednesday and replying let's get
started we are going to start with some
comments from YouTube our first one
comes from live from Ann Arbor and she
says how do you guys get over the
awkwardness of filming in public I'd
like to start making vlogs but I feel so
strange talking to the camera in public
you two seem so comfortable in front of
the camera so any advice would be
appreciated well live from Ann Arbor it
actually wasn't something that came
right away and Missy actually has some
really good insight about when we
started the daily vlog as well yeah I
mean when
Brian's started doing it it really
freaked me out
I was so like embarrassed when he did it
and I never would do it but you just
started getting more comfortable doing
it and then you almost start to not
notice it and but I still do I still
notice it way more than he would ever
notice it and I still cannot um vlog by
myself yeah she's in public she cannot
vlog in public I can try but it's just
so embarrassing it's like someone's
around like if he has to be next to me
and then I'm totally fine but like cuz
then it's like oh maybe she's just
talking to her husband but if it's just
me talking sometimes he'll be like
standing there talking to himself and
I'm like I gotta go over there because
it's like really embarrassing and I
think it it came very easily for me um
because I think it kind of just like
matched my personality more yeah I feel
like my personality was very much made
for holding the camera and talking and
talking to you guys like this so okay so
we have another youtube comment from
khlo loves makeup she said all you guys
are very sweet
I would love to enter every day but I'm
English backpack backpacking in
Australia for a year and I don't think
it'll fit my robe Zach one of you guys
to know that I only have a certain
amount of Internet data and your vlog
has now become a priority before any
other video keep doing what you're doing
English love from Down Under
Chloe Wow Chloe that is insane
first of all um we want to see some pics
on this backpacking thing that sounds
awesome and I think it's so cool that
like you're watching our show like with
your precious amount of Internet data I
don't know why you only have so much you
should probably find a different plan
where you can get more but that's so
cool that you like watch our vlogs and
like it's that it's I don't know it's
just so amazing and I just hope you stay
safe and keep watching and we love you
so next one is from sunshine Sundays and
it says was I the only one thinking that
the breathable bumper thing was kind of
funny
I mean we are bumpers and honestly we
Aegeus Wham blew it but my mom she was
like are you serious you guys did it you
guys way of saying like bumper
Rosberg on the world I know and then it
like the fact that it didn't click
afterwards because okay so if you don't
know we were looking for bumpers for
around the crib and we couldn't think of
the right word we could not think of the
word until finally we're like oh is a
bumper but we never win like click like
we like they're watching us as we talk
about this our bumpers are talking about
us watching this and then we felt so
like we were like wow epic fell okay so
now we'll move to comments from Facebook
Dakota Liang says hi Missy and Brian I
see that you guys know ASL can you sign
something on a daily blog by the way I'm
deaf
Thanks actually Missy knows I would say
a fair amount of ASL myself
I know maybe half the alphabet so I'm
not very good but we're gonna bring it
there yeah I don't know there's a few
things I know but actually Missy's
little sister is actually studying ASL
in school and she's got a little message
for you so we're going to bring her in
I was awesome thanks Catherine okay so
now let's move to comments from
Instagram I actually instagrammed a
picture of Missy enjoying a delicious
milkshake on the pier that we went to
today and tickled pink said did she try
to dump out half of it again and
actually the own mom was like huh I was
just gonna say that because whenever
Missy gets a milkshake from like
jack-in-the-box she will never drink the
whole thing she actually tricked me in a
vlog and she dumped out half of it to
make me think that she had drank the
whole thing and I didn't see until later
um but she actually liked that milkshake
ate the whole thing
I don't like jack-in-the-box milkshakes
that much like they're just too sweet so
I can't ever drink them all but that is
an amazing note shake I think it was
gone and even like she gave me the metal
tin and I maybe had like a couple drinks
but then she was like I'm gonna finish
that
okay next Instagram comment is from
Sweet Cheeks 1991 kidding it says lol

Grinch movie max he's so cute he does I
swear like I mean obviously his colors
