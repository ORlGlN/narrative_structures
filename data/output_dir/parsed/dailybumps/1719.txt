with like treats and dog bones and oh my
gosh what is that what is that Connor
what's in the kitchen biggis I've seen
it so far okay look at how stinky poopy
is oh we were going to what what I did
did you really I did
good morning I am getting some food
together I got my lunch and then I have
some just dry cereal and blueberries
because I really need to start eating
something in the morning cuz I rarely
ever do just running a little bit behind
I'm gonna pack this up and then I'm
headed to work is he's still getting
ready love you hmm how did it work okay
are you do I look like I'm headed to
camp today little bit nicer pretty much
good morning everyone so today has just
been a crazy morning already I kind of
just got back on that researching and
trying to figure out you know if I can
deliver at this birth center and it's
just like basically right now I'm on a
little ticking time clock basically
because I'm 32 weeks and technically
anyone who wants to take me once maybe
for 34 weeks and the place and they have
to like review my records and so I have
to get my records and then they have to
review them and see if I'm eligible and
so it's just like all this stuff that
has to be done and it all has to be done
before 34 weeks and they have to see me
an appointment so it's like everything
is just so crazy I'm like feeling Oh
totally stressed out by the way my
doctor's office is being so nice and
totally understanding I think that they
partially understand that my ideas for
my birth plan not that they're
completely far-fetched they're just
going to be hard to me at a hospital I'm
looking to probably transfer to a birth
center which honestly every time I even
say that I could be going to a birth
center I have like a mini happy dance
and a little panic attack I just I never
thought that that would be possible for
me at all just simply because I didn't
think that there was anything like that
that was covered around this area at all
now that this is like seems to be a
possibility I'm just getting so excited
and I'm also talking like a mile a
minute because I'm just so excited
crossing my fingers we'll see so just
got to the office no one's here yet look
at this look at this lovely art is that
Cat in the Hat not really sure that's
weird
wonder who did that and I'm finished
with this entire week this whole week
was so fast the day went really fast in
the week but really fast and now I only
have one week left until I'm done
working I'm so excited I just got off
work and I've been hearing something
about how Instagram just added video
poor vine is going to be gone now so I'm
gonna get in the car and make my first
Instagram video I did it I made my first
Instagram video is that what it's called
insta vid there's an instant vid what do
you guys think I think it's pretty safe
to say that no one's gonna be on vine
anymore so thank you to like the 500
something who were following me on vine
but we'll probably just be using
Instagram now I'm on my way home now and
I don't have to work again until Tuesday
it's actually really cool because I'm
only in the office for three days out of
the week
so you're four days off but I mean
pretty I've work I'm probably gonna work
a lot from home still um but it's just a
cool little change up I think I really
like being in an office it really like
disciplines you

radio what's up yeah cuz you shine
something like a mirror and I got up a
notice where there are you kindly with

ball and it rolled underneath the
playpen huh and now he's sad because you
