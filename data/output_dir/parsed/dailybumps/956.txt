morning and then I rushed off to my hair
appointment I got home and I'm trying to
get ready for our neighbor girl which
I'm really excited that we're filming
today and I wanted to wear this shirt
and look it totally doesn't fit me
anymore like I would have to like
stretch it and then if I sat down I'd
probably pop a button kind of a bummer
but I'm just gonna wear an apron over so
I'm not gonna worry about it I'm just
gonna wear a shirt that Toya doesn't fit
me but because we're filming does it
really matter so I get a li right now
bundled up a bunny a bunny you wanna get
out huh yeah
come here whose is that a bunny alright
let's get you dressed baby you always
get stressed so late in the day cuz
we're always doing stuff and then he
goes on first nap and I want to make
comfortable clothes when a nap so we
always get ready so late I'm gonna go
ahead and get dressed

to figure out what's in the fridge
something I don't know what it is what

do you want he want milk this is your no
you wanna get your milk okay I'll get
you your nuts oh no he's got it
thank you you just wanted it in the
fridge to grab your milk like a big boy
Oh chocolate yeah I just made lunch so
Missy's eating some lunch I made little
are they like chicken cordon bleu would
you say yes they could be chicken with
ham and Swiss I think that's like
chicken cordon bleu I don't know I was
just hungry and I thought we had it in
the fridge yes
so I went for it shake shake shake Holly
can you shake shake shake shake shake
shake shake foot chocolate milk is it
good what you got can I see he's got a G
huh Paulie these are for the name reveal
nice toucan dad to have it thank you
alright you drink your chocolate milk
and watch friends okay I had told ollie
that oh my goodness
so eyes well in a way that me me ask you
what they're coming over and I kill him
to keep watch he's been standing at that
door for like three or four minutes Wow
just waiting now
they're toddlers also going through the
screaming stay yeah and they also need
Ted so if you guys have any tips for
what to do with a spring table at least
tell us because that is a normal thing
yeah I'm gonna say don't encourage it
just tell them no every single time I
don't always really know what it is he's
doing yeah good evening and then moaning
and screaming as a noun oh yeah yeah and
that's what we've been doing we don't
really always discipline on the vlog too
I think a lot of people get confused
when we let him do things on the blog
cuz I'm not gonna sit here and stop and
be like no and I'm not gonna discipline
him on the vlog either way so he's just
having fun and it's cute right now but I
wanna scream if he's in trouble
don't scream if something bad was
happening it's hard to tell him no when
he's got a smile on yeah definitely yet
chocolate milk we've hardly blogged at
all today and the reason is is we've
been working on a very big project even
working on our neighbor field and I'm
really excited about it because we
actually we asked for suggestions yes I
don't like viewer suggested which is
kind of cool so we got a really awesome
suggestion from a viewer I basically
scratched her other idea yeah and this
turned out really really awesome yeah
all day long I know all day long it's
very meticulous well but here's the
kitchen table and there's the chairs and
here is the camera because we had to do
a top-down image but we could not get it
so what I did was is we pulled out the
tripod that we have the camera and it's
pointing down and the legs of the
tripods are in the chair and then
there's one on Oliver's playset and it's
tied yes we actually tied it with twine
so that the camera would point down all
because we
had to avoid shadow yeah there was a
gnarly shadow in there we could not do
that Missy we are professional youtubers
yeah surprise the videos up right now go
watch it link below in description on
Missy's channel subscribe to her channel
while you're there go give that video a
huge thumbs up that's Oliver screaming

of it they know and we're not saying it
for the rest of the blood so let us know
in the comments what you guys think of
the name and don't try not to spoil it
yeah yeah Oliver what do you think of
his name can you say it but yeah this
has essentially been taking up our
entire day but it's been a blast this is
what you do when you're a youtuber you
get to have fun with stuff like this and
I'm just really excited for Oliver to
have you know his videos on Macy's
channel like the gender reveal and the
name reveal and the birth story and
stuff like that that he can actually go
back and watch just to have this for our
new son I think is really special I
don't know are we gonna do this for all
our kids cuz this is a lot of work I
feel bad I was like oh we have to have a
name reveal for him because all he had a
name reveal and he's gonna be like yeah

love you
I'm so excited I love his name we do I
really do like I like his nickname of
the most yeah
every time Molly finished up the
neighbor veal and honestly I have
cleaned the kitchen like three times
today and I was like please don't make
dinner I don't want to clean it again so
we're headed out to dinner we're taking
Cassie because she was like a huge help
all day from the end I wish she could
live with us and just like oh my gosh
they watch it they know it I know I was
made in this probably tomorrow we'll
start saying and stuff cuz we haven't
even really been able to say it and real
life either just because if for vlogging
we don't want to accidentally say his
name and I don't know we just haven't
really done it so it'll be nice to like
be able to like actually say his name a
lot more instead of baby boy do you like
his name I love his name I think it's
really great and I think I've got his
nickname the most yeah we really those
and I think it sounds really good with
Ali's name I think they sound good oh
yeah really good yeah look at all he
keeps doing you guys
your FB holding injuries yeah he legit
has a drink his own drink and he is he
just wants a Mother's Day he's like

I worked up an appetite today there's no
rocks in there that's called ice can you
say ice ice
so all he's doing this completely random
thing with bread now he puts pepper on
it and then puts it back very nicely I
my dad puts the salt on it yep
puts it also back very nicely right next
to the pepper and then takes a bite
I can't even with this kid Cassie also
one thing he always does all the time is
he would dip something and like a sauce
but he won't eat it I wonder if he's
like maybe thinking oh that's yummy
you think he'll eat it he gets something
into a sauce where the cow stay he's
been doing this for a while he'll say no

like it's just really was really random
