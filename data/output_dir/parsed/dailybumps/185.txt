- There was one thing though (laughs)
that kind of stopped our photo shoot,
which was, the fire department showed up.
(sirens wailing)
(upbeat music)
♫ This is our life
♫ This is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream
♫ This is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever.
- Good morning
- Good morning, guys.
- What happened to your face?
- My face?
- Yeah.
- What do you mean?
Doesn't seem different to me.
- Black.
- (laughs) Daddy has a mask on.
Hello, guys.
So, this morning we are actually doing
an all-day family photo shoot,
'cause we have a special project
that we really need photos for.
Are you excited, take
some cool photos today?
Yeah.
So, yeah I decided to put on
this intense purifying mud mask,
and it's like really freaking me out.
Missy said she did a
mask this morning, too.
- Yep, I did a really cool one.
It almost felt like I was
putting glue on my face.
-  Oh, interesting.
Hopefully, this will help a little bit.
I don't know, we'll see.
- (laughs) It's like yeah,
it's pretty cool.
(Finn hollering)
(Bryan hollering)
- Finn, what do you think of daddy's face?
(Finn babbles)
Is it weird?
- Yeah.
(laughs)
-  What are you eatin'?
Cereal?
Awesome, you're such a good eater.
- Mommy.
-  What are you boys doing?
You playing in ball pit balls?
This is always a fun time.
We have Brooke and Sean
over shooting some photos.
This is gonna be one of them,
the boys covered in ball pit balls.
Ollie, wait, wait!
Ollie!
(laughing)
That's counter productive.
(laughing)
Working with kids, right?
(upbeat techno music)
The boys are loving this.
They get to play
in ball pit balls
- One, two.
-  Glam squad
for Missy.
- Yeah.
-  Getting her face on.
- Pretty much excited
because I had no one this morning
to do my hair.
- And now look!
She's got two girls!
You girls are awesome.
Thanks for showing up.
- I'm actually a lot happy.
I'm really happy
'cause I was, like, kind of stressing.
I'm not like that good at doing make-up
- Yeah.
- Or my hair.
(laughs)
-  Well, the pictures so far
are turning out good, but
we're almost ready for you.
- And this just gives me
like a little more confidence look.
- Yeah.
- You're looking good, baby.
We have so much decor
and fun stuff out
for the shoot we're doing
for our top-secret project.
Shhh! We can't tell you guys yet.
But I do need popsicles for the boys,
because they've been
working so hard today.
I have too, that's why I'm sweating.
I've done my hair three
times for the shoot,
and I still haven't even
taken pictures of myself yet.
But they boys need some popsicles.
(upbeat techno music)
-  Alright, Finn is...
Finn's quite messy (laughs)
Because he ate that popsicle,
and Ollie's ready to-- (yells)
I just redid my hair for the fourth time.
(upbeat techno music)
High five, dude, you did good.
Was that fun? Yeah?
We are currently in bed.
You know, it's always funny because
we used to film on our bed.
And people would always be like,
"Why do you have a camera
pointed at your bed?"
(upbeat techno music)
- Christmas time!
-  Yes it is!
Or at least we're pretending it is.
(Missy laughs)
Look it, Missy's even got
her reindeer antlers on.
The boys are all dressed up.
We're shooting some fun photos.
Top secret project.
We haven't told them yet, have we?
- You haven't told them?
I feel like (mumbles)
- Top secret project,
you're never gonna know!
Yeah, so I have to wear
a Christmas sweater.
It's summer time in California.
So I put it in the freezer
so that it wasn't super hot.
Now it feels amazing.
(upbeat techno music)
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
- It's not Christmas time,
we're just pretending, huh?
- Hey, it's Christmas
time always in this house.
(laughs)
- This is so cool, Missy.
We're like covered in...
- I know, I'm like so excited.
- They're like holding
lights (laughs) behind us.
- I'm just gonna start
decorating the house
for Christmas now.
- So beautiful.
(Bryan laughs)
Isn't this her jam?
-  (laughs) Brooke...
Brooke is very excited about this year.
Look how cute she is!
Aww. She's got her straw hat.
-  It's so cute.
-  Make-up on point. (laughs)
-  Hair on point.
-  We're gonna go
play with some chickens,
and take some photos?
- Yep. Ready.
-  Okay.
Yes, our front door is
decorated with fall decorations.
Don't judge us though, okay?
We're doing something cool.
We're doing something
really cool, you guys.
We've been having the funnest day,
the most productive day
we've probably ever had
doing these photo shoots, and
now we're doing the last one,
which is quite possibly the coolest.
I think you guys are gonna
really enjoy what you see,
what comes out of this.
So now, we are walking down the courtyard,
and to this pasture
little area, for the dirt.
And we're all in white. Kinda ironic.
We're all in white, and we're
hanging out in the dirt.
♫ We stand together
♫ We protect the keys
♫ This is our life
♫ This is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our--
They already listened to that, Missy,
because they've seen the intro.
- I know. We love that song.
Ollie loves that song, huh?
-  What's your
favorite part of the song?
- "We have shields"!
- Yeah, that is his favorite song.
You guys, we're finally done. (laughs)
That was the longest day,
but it was so much fun.
- It was like a seven-hour shoot.
(Missy exclaims)
- The kids are done.
Finn's probably passed out (laughs).
- He's like, super dead.
- (yawns)
They're probably so confused
why they changed their outfit
like a dozen times.
- Look it, I still have
all of my extensions.
My make-up is done.
We're starving, we have no food (laughs).
The house is a disaster.
- Such a disaster.
- (laughs) So I was like, we're
getting out of this house,
we're gonna go get some food.
We're gonna come back,
put the kids to bed,
and clean up and go to bed.
(laughs) So anyways, yeah,
we're heading to go get food.
But it was a really,
really fun, fun shoot.
We love Brooke.
We have a few different
photographers that we use,
and we love Brooke.
She's such a cool friend,
and she's a really good photographer.
There was one thing, though (laughs)
that kind of stopped our photo shoot,
which was, the fire department showed up.
(sirens wail)
- You will know why they
were called very soon.
- We didn't get in trouble.
Everything was totally fine,
and it wasn't a big deal.
- It was really funny.
- But it was really funny. (laughs)
We were like, oh no, this is so weird.
And yeah, everything was fine,
but that definitely happened.
(laughs)
Anyways, let's go get dinner.
So we have ended up at Denny's.
I don't know why, it just
sounded like good comfort food
after a long day.
And look at Finn, he is out.
I mean like, so out.
I feel so bad.
We skipped his nap because actually
when he naps...
- We actually skipped naps
and we skipped lunch today.
- Yeah, we're starving.
- We worked through lunch.
- The kids ate, but we didn't eat.
But actually, naps are
great, but Finn does wake up
in a worse mood usually, so I was like,
let's just skip.
He did really, really good.
He's just so out.
Look at that face.
He never is just still
asleep when you pick him up.
(laughs)
Go give that bacon a high-five.
(laughs)
High-five.
High-five, bacon, high-five.
(slaps cardboard)
Yeah.
-  Hey Ollie, I
got chocolate milk too.
Wanna cheers Daddy?
- After I get this rope on here.
- Okay, I mean, priorities, yeah.
Okay, cheers? Cheers.
Cheers. Cheers.
To a long, hard day of
work, you guys. (laughs)
You earned that chocolate milk, buddy.
-  (laughs) Boys are getting some
last-minute play time in
before it's bed time. (laughs)
(boys chattering, making shooting sounds)
Aww, I love you.
(Ollie making shooting sounds)
(laughs) Oh, hug.
Finn's so cute, he has to
do everything Ollie does.
What's that?
- That's my laser eyes.
-  Oooh.
(Finn babbles)
(laughs) You got some secret power?
(Finn babbles)
(Ollie makes shooting sounds)
- They're so cute, I've just
been watching them play.
Oh, they're both on the ground now.
(laughs)
They are all ready for bed.
I'm just letting them
play a little bit longer.
It's a beautiful night out right now.
It's kinda chilly but yet
not too chilly, you know?
It's so nice.
We had so much fun today,
despite the fire department
showing up at our house.
That was a little weird.
But we had a ton of fun.
It was a long, long day.
You know, our life is
different and it's kinda crazy,
but it's fun, and the kids love it,
and we have fun family time.
I did want to tell you guys,
that if you don't know,
our new single is out.
You can buy it now on iTunes.
And we love it.
We literally listen to it
every time we are in the car,
because these boys think it
is the coolest song ever.
So if you guys want to check it out,
I'll have a link down below.
But for now, we're gonna
go ahead and end the video.
Time for these boys to go to bed.
These little boys. My little baby boys.
And it's time for me to go to bed.
I need to wash my face
and get this hair off me.
I hope you guys enjoyed this video.
Make sure you give it a big thumbs up.
Hey boys, thumbs up this video!
Yeah!
And we'll see you guys tomorrow.
What do you say?
- Bye! Boop.
