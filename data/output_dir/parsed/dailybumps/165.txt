- I'm having a prank being
set up at the house right now.
If you don't know,
yesterday's vlog we showed
that we caught a snake.
A really scary looking snake
that we've never seen before.
My dad bought us a snake
that looks exactly the same.
It's huge.
It's definitely the mama.
- I wonder if there's more,
like, if this is a baby.
- Where's the nest?
♫ This is our life
♫ This is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This our dream
♫ This is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live forever
- Good morning!
Arg!
- Arg!
Good morning, my little pirates.
We're doing some early
morning boat work, right?
Trying to fix this boat.
- Yeah, it's a birthday party.
- It is?
- Yeah.
- Is that why you guys are
all dressed up like pirates?
Whoa!
Can you do a spin?
That's a good looking pirate.
Finn, he's got his pirate onesie on.
- He's a bad pirate.
-  And you're a good pirate?
-  Yeah.
-  And you guys have to battle?
- Yeah.
- Good morning, guys.
Today is Olivia's birthday,
which is another one of Ollie's cousins.
He's got two cousins names Olivia, huh?
And it's mermaid themed,
so we thought we would dress the boys up
in their pirate costumes,
so they can kinda fit
the theme a little bit.
All right, boys, you ready?
We're getting ready to leave right now.
Hey, Ollie, do you know where
the birthday party's at?
- Where?
-  It's at the bouncy place.
The trampoline park.
You didn't know that?
- That's awesome!
-  Okay, well,
let's go have fun, kids.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, you ready too?
- Yeah.
-  Ooh, we've got a
sexy mermaid in the kitchen.
She's all dressed up, too.
Ready?
- I basically just
found another reason to wear
my mermaid tights again.
- Yes.
- CJ!
- Hi, CJ.
The kids are playing in the ball pit.
Aw.
Save him!
Save him, CJ!
They're headed up.
Go, go, go, go, go!
There's Bailey and Ollie.
Oh, my gosh, Finn is way up there.
Finn, what are you doing up there?
(upbeat music)
You got it, Ollie.
Whoa!
Nice.
Ollie is playing some ski ball with uncle
here at the arcade.
Nice!
Missy was just playing this hoop game
and I was telling her we need
one of these in our house.
How cool would that be, you guys,
to have a hoop game in our house?
We're not huge basketball fans,
but we do love playing these
in arcades all the time.
It's fun versus, too.
(upbeat music)
Go!
Oh, did you?
Oh! No!
No!
No.
Sorry.
You're gonna try this time, Ollie?
-  I think he did it!
-  Oh!
No.
- They do it on purpose.
- He's so upset.
-  They make it so they won't grab.
-  Yeah.
-  Ollie, it's okay.
We'll try again.
This is, like, the tenth try.
We've spent way too
much money on this game.
Try and get it, babe.
Come on.
Don't let the machine win.
Don't let the machine win.
Oh, what is that?
- It almost had it.
I'm done.
Done.
-  Six dollars down the drain.
We're trying to get a ball, Jessica.
- I'll buy you a bouncy ball.
Go to the Dollar Store.
-  Okay.
(crowd singing Happy Birthday)
She's hiding.
Where's that little mermaid?
There she is.
- Happy birthday, Olivia!
(upbeat music)
-  Hey, Ollie,
did you have so much fun?
- Yeah, look at what I got.
- Ooh, you got a Ring Pop
and what else did you get at the party?
M&Ms and candy bars.
Yeah.
That was a fun time, huh?
Ollie's like, I wanna eat peanut
butter and jelly for lunch
so that I can eat all my candy afterwards.
That's been his favorite
thing to eat for lunch.
That's a Ring Pop, Ollie.
Remember, you had those at your party.
- Oh, yeah.
It was the pirate party yest--
-  Yeah.
You doing okay back there, babe?
- Yeah.
It's a stinky one.
- Finn had a little poopy
and we just had our car cleaned out,
so we had no diapers stashed away.
So, he is now wearing
cousin Olivia's diaper,
which has sheep and
clouds and moons on it.
- Yeah, it's so cute.
- It was
actually really cute.
- All right, we had a blast
at Olivia's birthday party,
but now, we are getting some air and sun
and now, we are shopping.
- Look at this.
-  And the boys are pretty excited.
- They're in the police
cart shopping cart.
Police car shopping cart.
-  Are you guys in trouble?
- Nope.
-  Or are you the policeman?
- We're two policemen.
- Oh, so you guys are the policemen.
I thought you guys were being arrested.
I think me and daddy are the policemen
and we're taking you guys to jail.
-  Yeah, we're taking you guys in.
- Probably for that weapon you have.
We've gotta grab some food for the house.
- You know what we really need to grab?
-  What?
- Candy.
-  Oh, my gosh.
-  Yep, it's that time.
- I hate when candy's in the house.
- I love candy in the house
and I've been craving it.
- I do like candy,
but when there's candy, this
guy can't even think straight.
- Look at this.
-  Oh, my gosh.
- That's pretty cool.
- Yeah.
-  How neat is that?
Jack Skellington.
(singing the Nightmare
Before Christmas theme)
- Put it back.
-  This cart is filling up fast
and I think a lot of the reason is 'cuz
it's mostly filled with two kids.
- Yeah.
You guys are cutting in
on our storage, here.
- Yeah, but you know what?
It's pretty nice 'cuz they
have been really enjoying
driving around in the police car
and it's kept them very well entertained
and contained while we shop.
Okay, guys, me and Bryan
are shopping right now,
but what he doesn't
know is that I actually
convinced him that we need to go shopping
because we need to stall.
I'm having a prank being set
up at the house right now.
If you don't know,
yesterday's vlog we showed
that we caught a snake.
A really scary looking snake
that we've never seen before.
I'll have it linked up here so you can see
what it looks like.
My dad bought us a snake
that looks exactly the same.
It's huge.
It's definitely the mama.
- Okay, Missy.
Don't show this video to Bryan,
but I just bought this on Amazon.
He's hiding.
- And so, my parents
are setting up the prank
right now so when we get home,
he's going to hopfully grab a package
and the snake's gonna
slither out and get him.
Let's see how it goes.
I'm nervous.
Hopefully, he doesn't find out.
-  So, this is the package that
was down by the gate.
It has fresh flowers in it.
Normally, it is sitting by the gate
or by the front door.
Maybe Luna got a hold of it.
I don't know, but it's
gonna be over by the steps.
(sneaky music)
Okay, so here's where
the package is gonna be.
Here's where the snake is gonna be.
(sneaky music)
That pretty good?
(sneaky music)
- All right, we made it out,
but not without two carts.
- Yeah.
Big trip this time.
- We ended up needing two.
This is just a little cart, okay?
But now we've got all the
snacks, all the food, huh?
You guys ready to go home?
- We got this!
-  Oh, yeah, and candy.
Daddy really wanted candy, huh?
- Yeah, I like these ones.
- He likes those ones.
All right, guys, we're locked and loaded.
He's headed for the box
that's out in the thing.
It's got flowers in it
and so, he's pretty excited
to grab his flowers.
Here we go.
(mysterious music)
- Holy (beep)
Oh, my gosh.
(upbeat music)
(laughing)
- You are the worst!
- What was it?
What was it?
(laughing)
Oh, my gosh.
I've been waiting all day
for you to get this box.
- Whatever!
(laughing)
-  It's really scary.
- That this is really freaking scary.
-  That's the mama.
The mama's here.
The mama came to get you.
It think we got him.
- Got him, oh yeah!
- He just got shut down.
-  Look, Bryan.
Look, Bryan.
-  Oh, it's still going.
Awesome.
I don't know if that one's still going.
- Dang it!
You were taking forever.
I was like, Bryan, I'll
put away the dishes
and I'll put away all the groceries.
He's like, what am I gonna do though?
I'm gonna be so bored.
I'm like, go get your freaking box.
- He said you'd take forever.
-  Little stinker.
- Am I really that blind?
Missy got me so good, you guys.
That was seriously a
very impressive prank.
Not only did she do that
while we were out shopping,
she got her mom and dad to join in on it
and even set it up.
- I know, I have never
been good at doing pranks.
There were a couple times
that even when in the store
I was, like, trying to
vlog without him knowing.
He's like, why are you being so weird.
- I know, she's like, I
need to go get medicine.
I was like, we're going
that way, let's go together
and she was being so annoying about it.
- Oh, I forgot the cream of chicken soup.
And then, I like ran down to go get it.
- Whatever.
- But it worked.
I did it.
Yes.
-  Yes, she pranked me.
- It was really good,
but we did come home to some bad news.
- You guys know we got a couple
of clown fish the other day.
We got two of the normal ones
and then, we got a designer clown fish
that was actually bred
and when we put the three
of them in the tank,
I knew right away that something was wrong
with the designer one.
It was very, very aggressive and fast
and it would, like, hit the other fish
and I was like, what is going on.
So, that's the normal clown fish,
that's the designer one, the white one.
That one is very aggressive and it killed
our other clown fish, you guys.
I'm so sad.
We came home and we just
found him lying there
and look, she's even nipping at this one.
I'm so bummed and that means,
basically, she's a girl.
When the clown fish is aggressive,
that means it's the girl.
- I'm pretty sure it's a girl
and you can tell now,
like, she's got, like,
the Nemo one has, like, scuffs on it.
- Yeah, it looks really beat up and stuff,
so it's kinda sad 'cuz
we're probably gonna have to
get rid of that one if
she's gonna be eating
my beautiful clown fish,
which is sad 'cuz she's pretty, too,
but maybe we'll try another
designer clown fish,
but if they're aggressive at all,
then we can just take them back
instead of waiting for them to do damage,
you know what I mean?
- And we're already
worried about this one.
We can't really do anything
with her right now.
-  Yeah.
I'm like, you better leave him alone.
- I think we're gonna try and feed them
a little bit of food.
Maybe she's just hungry or bored.
-  I fed them
this morning, but okay.
That shouldn't be much of an excuse.
Get it, guys, get it.
Get it Pearl.
If you're friendly, we'll keep you, okay?
They're so happy.
Look at them.
-  Here comes Felix.
-  Oh, there's Felix.
Felix is coming out.
He's like, hey, guys.
How's it going?
-  Oh, got myself a bloodworm.
Oh, and another one.
-  Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
I love these fish, you guys.
They're so cool.
I'm so bummed we lost one of our Nemos.
We're gonna have to get
a couple more of those
'cuz they like to be in groups of three.
This is the culprit, I believe.
We'll see.
I'm gonna ask.
I'm gonna call the guys at the fish shop
and see if that's, like, something that
this fish is even capable of doing.
Hey! Get away from him!
Hey!
Hey!
See, she's naughty!
- We are now at my mom's house.
Although, I took her out on her birthday,
we went shopping and all that,
I did get her one more specific present.
I think she knows what it is.
- Well, not very many things are round.
-  This is her present.
Me and Bryan consider this
a more sentimental gift.
- It's a new microwave.
-  Yeah.
It's a very new, different
kind of microwave.
- New microwave.
-  But me and Bryan
consider it more sentimental.
What is it, Ollie?
- I don't know.
-  It's an I don't know.
- It's that new kind of
paper that doesn't tear.
-  Oh.
-  A clock.
A new giant clock.
- That's nice.
- Yeah.
The last one broke.
-  Yeah, we bought
them a giant clock in Idaho.
- That was in Idaho?
- Yeah, years ago
we bought that last one in Idaho.
- It was a long time ago
and I remember them being, like--
- Thanks for the giant clock
and then, you guys loved it.
- Yeah.
We used it all the time
and when it wasn't
working, we were like, aw.
- And you know what?
It should go right there.
-  Yeah, that's
perfect right there.
- Yeah, that is a good spot.
- Yeah, this is pretty cool.
There was a bigger one
and we didn't go with the bigger one.
- It's nice.
I like London, England, too.
- Yeah, we went to London, so.
All right, we have had so
much fun at Mimi's, huh?
And we had so much fun.
- Yeah.
- Like, yeah, it's very late.
Are we tired?
Yeah.
Are you tired?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
We had so much fun at Liv's birthday
and we just had a really, really good day,
but now, the boys actually
got to take a bath
and eat dinner here
and now, we're gonna head home, huh?
He's like, I'm so tired, mom.
All right, well, let's just go ahead
and give this video a big thumbs up
and I just gotta say, I'm still so excited
that I got Bryan, I pranked him so good.
Actually, my parents helped me a lot.
I could not have done it without them
and it was kinda my dad's idea.
So, we got you good.
- It was a group effort.
- Yeah.
So, anyways, we got you good,
but anyways, make sure you give this video
a big thumbs up, right, boys,
who are making a total mess right now?
And we'll see you guys tomorrow.
What do you say?
(upbeat music)
