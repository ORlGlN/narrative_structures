you flip flip flip flip improv
baby boy hi
honey baby
you have whoa
is going to do amazing things right
outside Wow it's like it's like 11 some
I think it's like 11 10
it's the first time I've slept past 11
in this place cuz usually this skylight
in our bathroom lets in a lot of light
and so we wake up pretty early last
night was pretty gnarly
Oliver definitely gave us a run for our
money I'm sure Missy was way worse
because I'm sure she didn't wake me up
for all of it but I was up for quite a
bit trying to get him to chill out now I
just wanna crawl back into this bet you
guys cause I'm talking the bed can't do
that didn't do that guys garlic in a bed
there's my little guy hey hey buddy
get him looking around hey take this out
of your way let me get this out of your
way I know
there you go that's better huh that
better you kept your mommy up all night
last night huh I do not know how this
guy could be still awake because of her
like four hours straight which is like
not even I don't think he's ever gonna
wait for that one at one time he was
just not happy last night I don't know
if maybe there's something there was
something in my milk or he just was not
feeling very good but something in your
milk that kept him up all night if he
wasn't he didn't seem gassy
that's the only thing is like sometimes
like they get gassy it keeps him up
yeah but he wasn't really gassy he was
just not feeling it
didn't want to sleep but I don't know
how you're not passed out right now hey
I could be passed out right now I'm
exhausted
it's favorite positions his favorite
music nothing was working honestly I
think he was going through um some
cluster feeding because he really fed a
lot last night and now I'm completely in
gorged and so much pain so I think he
was just
he was kind of going through a growth
spurt and he still is probably so he's
almost officially 40 weeks right
what oh I think he'll be 40 weeks yeah
like my due date is on next Thursday so
he's almost born you're almost here
he's had to jump the gun a little
denture yeah his eyes are like big and
open yeah
and I see green oh my gosh just goes
back and forth so calm now oh god you
guys just fell the funniest thing ever
bleep lip lip lip lip lip lip lip lip
lip lip lip lip lip lip lip lip lip lip
lip lip ooh ooh please like that please
stop hi boy good morning karma how are
you how are you Oliver needs a clean
diaper this one's done for but I'm gonna
let him decide Oliver do you want a pink
one you are a green one do you want a
yellow one definitely doesn't wanna get

which one you want green you just oh I

play mold green it is this is just my
favorite diapers look well let's go
green so we are getting ready to go
we're gonna head over to my grandpa's
place and he still hasn't met Ollie and
Oliver is now officially two weeks old
so I'm getting his diaper bag ready
which I actually will be probably
filming my cloth diapering video on the
go really soon and obviously the diaper
bag videos you know what I put my egg
bag but that's what I'm getting ready
for right now so and I just noticed I
have all the way down here it's not it's
not the pads though it's just when he
eats it just gets everywhere and I
always put like almost like a bib for me
but I think the the last um receiving
blanket that I used just wasn't thick
enough and went right through and so it
just got everywhere so that kind of
sucks I'm sure it'll dry I'm so over
laundry I'm so over my laundry
I just can't believe how much stuff I
get dirty he doesn't even get that much
stuff dirty it's more of me I am milk

achoo gotcha gotcha it's not nothing
oh yeah oh yeah daddy did it
thumbs up for daddy right hum boy thumbs
up the video guys cuz I'm so cute hey
Katie Oliver's gonna be his grandpa
today actually so yeah we're thinking
about calling him Papa Papa how because
my dad is Papa and is the second Papa
like about me papa
pops I'm Emma Papa - Papa the first I
like Papa Papa my grandpa is kind of
funny cuz you always expect him to like
do something amazing but his reactions
always just like oh yeah we're
projecting he's gonna be like oh there
is that he does he likes 2.0 he cares
but you just he has trouble showing him
yeah he's a Hollister honestly like
wheat none of us have good reactions
Bryan always expects like this huge
reaction from me and I'm just like cool
but can you believe that like a few
weeks ago we were here and I was like
miserably plight pregnant
