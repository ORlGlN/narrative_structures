crazy climber okay wherever you are
that's whatever wanna be inside
here
just wandering around you got
coming alright just again
Wow
i'm gramby
good morning guys say good morning Miami
we are up this morning and ready for a
day and we're doing something fun day
what are we doing today like le carr√©
circle it was like Marshall oh that's
right he is actually doing a float test
today and what that means is that he is
going to jump in with all his clothes on
and show us that he can still safely get
out of the pool even if he were to fall
in with his shoes and shirt and pants
and everything so it's a good kickoff
for summer just a reminder to be really
careful in the pool but if he were to
fall in that he could get out are you
gonna be able to do it ollie you sure
yeah I think he can do it too he's
actually done this in the past but it's
all it's good to just start every year
not just kill money in new to money so
if there's too much money in his pocket
he won't be able to swim oh I guess
that's true huh yeah he is gonna show
I'm gonna do this first I know Finn is
practicing he's getting there
alright let's go oh no Ben's got a sword
Ollie I think you have to sword fight
him they give the sword fighter Holly
wins oh it's good that laughs protect
mama ally protect mama from the evil bin
hey I think the start is dead why get my
videos yeah your sunglasses help yeah
alright they're getting ready to jump in
and they actually give them their own
shoes so they don't ruin their food so I
think it's really cool and kind of
person taking the first time so I don't
know she's so sure about herself but all
you've excited he wants he always wants
to jump into this Raj
actually there we go yes ready
okay good job dude you gotta stay on
your back a little longer though you did
it buddy
I'm so proud of you yeah well I felt
like a lot of clothes on so I wanted him
to like get the worst case scenario yeah
until I said mom I go shoes were heavy
and your peers are heavy but you smell a
good job oh oh
therefore he yeah I'm hungry we worked
up an appetite
slim didn't we and it's doing such a
good job eating peanut butter and jelly
we are at put twist with the Johnson
this is the kids table how are we eating
our food good hey Olli not a single bite
I got to take with the chips now okay
but can you take a bite of your sandwich
Satan can you help him eat a sandwich oh
god I think can you encourage him live
can you mommy him you can tell him to
eat a sandwich I know you're good at
mommy we're going to eat some Joey me
yes we are look what we got you guys we
have the official Jelly Belly bean
boozled game well you don't get to pick
it you got to spin the dial and then
whatever it lands on you got to eat so
if you guys don't know we've actually
done this challenge before with Olli and
it was hilarious if you want to go watch
that
I'll have the video in the iCard in the
corner so you can click it and go watch
it but today we're going to play it as
well with Sid who I think is going to
love it so many of you guys have been
asking us to play this game we finally
broke it out okay so this is the bean
boozled game what you do is you spin and
it's going to land on a jelly bean and
the jelly bean is either going to be
really yummy like peach or really gross
like barf so basically you have to eat
it and you have to decide if it's yummy
one gets the gross one and sometimes
it's just I think not knowing what it's
going to be is also part of like the
mentality of it that's true you ready to
try it all right who wants to go first
me you do okay all right always spin the
wheel ooh this is a good one to start
with
so you're each going to get a jelly bean
it's either going to be buttered popcorn
or rotten egg all right so it's on the
container with both beans inside yeah
we're going to open it up and each of
them are going to take one we're going
to see who's lucky with it's a nice
whoo pop I want to be yummy all right
eat at the same time don't eat it then
eat it
is it not yummy oh oh you okay I ain't
really both gross are you guys just
being silly
does it taste like okay nothing all
right it is now Missy a nice turn and
I'm going to spin Oh got a spin again

comments below what your favorite jelly

boozled jelly bean that you guys have
ever eaten before they come out with a
lot of new ones like I didn't know they
had will milk oh I used to be baby wipe
oh yeah absolutely and hey there is
comment check this out you guys part of
our pool fences up now and we have glass
not cool Ollie you got to be really
careful with it so you don't run into it
k last time we had like a temporary pool
fence up it was this little wire fencing
and it worked really good but now we
have something a little more permanent
more nicer so like you can actually see
through it some of the glasses in like
we're missing all the games and we're
missing all the corners but you can kind
of get an idea of how the pool fence is
going to be structured which is actually
really nice the kids can be in here and
knock it in the pool which is really
cool in this backyard in the pool yeah a
little bit it's been hard for months
without one dangerous interior yeah we
never had glass pool fences look super
nice you guys can see it goes all the
way in that corner and then over there
and then connects to the pool right
there so might like a lot more open if
you're in like the barbecue area a
little bit more like yeah and everything
he just texts me said it should all be
in by next week
yeah I'm so happy - my dad was able to
raise I know the pieces that we don't
have glossy just like kind of zip ties -
so it's like this so scary when you have
kids like we have options to get to this
point but then when they get if they get
to the toy life is scary yeah what do
you do do it about nothing like a good
old trampoline and what's wrong you are
in all right come on all right kiddos
you're stuck forever now it is such a
beautiful day out you guys it's like 92
degrees finally starting to get hot and
I'm kind of like so relieved because we
have a really big pool party this month
and I was hoping it wasn't going to be
cold during it so seems like we finally
got some warmth
what y'all done jump in I'm happy to
report to you that those big yellow
circles on the lawn are finally starting
to come back to life the bubble balls
killed those but coming in pretty nice
now and check out behind the pool they
are leveling it out putting compost in
and thought I think comes in on Saturday
