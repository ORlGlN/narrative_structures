putting Finn in hopefully he's good
Missy is driving a car what do you think
babe it's really nice
just like a little four-door sedan yeah
something to zip around town in yeah I
really like it it's it's got carplay
stuff that I wanted plus room for the
kids in the back it's also got a sunroof
which is cool and it has car play most
important thing she said she did not
want a car that does not have car play
yeah and that's that's passed our car
play but you like the way it drives and
everything yeah it's not like the Volvo
it's not gonna like fly the Volvo like
hovers from the ground basically it's
fun like we present I guess also this
comes from Missy who never drives also
she's like oh this is what driving is
like push on the gas and it goes forward
I like to get mom and dad checking out
the new car when you guys think um yeah
that's right yeah
it's cute and it's cool um still not for
sure they're talking numbers right now
I'm actually go in there hey you in our
car you don't only get to walk around in
a car do you yeah this one has 10
airbags in it

keep it in the lane and the distance in
front of you yeah got all knees like
buzzes at you and vibrates and uh pretty
cool I'm pretty and very happy with it
um obviously I'm still not 100% sure if
we're getting it I I just like this
though I like to be able to back out
anytime they're not cooperating with my
rules then I'm like peace out guys
because I don't want them to ever think
that I'm like sold I want this car no
