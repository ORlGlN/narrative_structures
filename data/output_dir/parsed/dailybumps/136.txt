- Emily asked, "Will we
be having any more kids?"
- It's funny, because
Missy and I actually,
last night, were just talking about this.
We have decided that,
♫ This is our life this is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream this is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
- Hey guys, we got
something cool to tell you.
-  Our merch store is open!
- Yes, it has been a long time coming.
We've been working on this
for a long time for you, guys
and we're so excited
to share with you, guys
all of our new merch.
- Yup
- So cool, we're wearing it right now.
We're wearing it.
- Yeah.
- That's so neat.
- Aren't they so cute?
Look at him.
Look at Finney.
-  Finns even got a little shirt.
Oh, cute Finn's face.
Hey, Ollie, want to show 'em your shirt?
- Yeah.
-  All right, what is it?
- It's me and Finn.
-  And what are
you guys dressed as?
- Dinosaurs.
-  Dinosaurs?
And it's got the special,
Daily Bumps dinosaur logo.
Isn't that so cool?
- Yeah.
-  Is that your
favorite shirt ever?
- Rawr.
-  Hey, Finn.
Look at your new shirt!
What do you think dude?
- What does it say?
-  Finn is wearing
a Daily Bumps onesie.
Check out that logo, bro.
-  Isn't that cute?
- Looking slick.
- Rawr!
-  Ollie's really excited
about the dinosaur shirt.
- We got backpacks and lunch boxes.
-  That's right, we do!
New backpacks are in,
so that you, guys can
look stylish at school.
So they have the dinosaur
Daily Bumps logo all over them.
- It's got Ollie and Finn
dressed as dinosaurs.
-  So cute, all over.
And then, check out
this orange on the back.
I love that, that bright,
bright orange color.
It's really, really cool.
- I feel like this is cool,
because it's very, like gender neutral.
It's fun, its cute
and of course, it's Daily Bumps.
-  Yeah, and it's a good backpack.
Just like the backpacks we sold last time.
And we also have lunch boxes.
Finn's going to show it off.
What's on the lunch box, Finn?
Is that you and Ollie?
- Yeah.
- Isn't that so cool?
- Can I take this to school?
-  You sure can, buddy.
We're going to start packing your lunch
in this awesome Daily Bumps lunchbox.
-  So cute.
-  Do you like it?
- Yeah.
-  What's your
favorite part about it?
- I'm a dinosaur.
-  Yeah, you and your brother are
both dressed as dinosaurs.
- That's me and Finn.
- Yeah.
All right, I'm going to
have Missy walk you guys
through the rest of
the stuff that we have.
Really cool stuff.
- Yeah, okay.
So we've got a hat.
You guys, know how much I love hats.
It says Daily Bumps.
-  Look at these colors too.
It's like a neon blue and a neon red.
It's embroidered, so you can feel it.
All right, what else do we got?
- We've got PopSockets, which
I'm really excited about.
It says Daily Bumps and it's so cute.
-  What's cool about PopSockets,
is that you can use it to
hold your phone, better.
You can also use it to
stand up your phone.
It's pretty awesome.
- And I've even got one
on mine and I'm addicted.
- So, something that we're
doing this time around
with our shop, is,
we are accommodating the entire family
and I'm going to have Missy
walk you guys through all that.
- So, as you guys can see,
we have basically, two designs,
we've got the dinosaur design,
which is super, super cute
and really fun and we've got the one
Bryan's wearing, right
now, which is Daily Bumps.
And then, we've got sizes in adults,
we've got them in youth
and we've got them in babies or toddlers,
which are super cute.
-  Check these out.
So, these onesies come in both designs
and they're super comfy.
They're just like, the three
button closure on the bottom,
so, they're easy
and I love all the youth sizes shirts,
so, Ollie can get in on the fun
and of course, we've
got the adult sizes too.
- Yeah, so, we've got both
designs on all the sizes,
which is really awesome.
Everyone can wear a Daily Bumps shirt.
- So head on over to dailybumpsmerch.com
or click that link, down
below, in the description,
to get yourself some new swag.
You guys, like all the new stuff, so cool.
I'm so excited, we finally
have merch for you guys.
So, go check it out.
- Good morning, guys.
I am just getting my hair all done.
Me and Kelsey worked out this morning
and we had an awesome workout.
- Love you.
-  Huh?
- Love you.
- I love you.
You guys having fun?
You guys, if you know,
we had to cut a dreadlock out
of Finn's hair, the other day.
If you haven't seen it,
I'll have it linked up here.
And it was actually really sad
because I had to cut his hair
and he has just made another one.
It's not as bad yet, but look at this.
There it is right there.
It's a little blurry, hang on.
Yeah, it's just a little piece.
He is such a little stinker.
I can maybe, hopefully,
I can get it out tonight,
if I put some conditioner in
it while he's taking a shower
but I'm worried, because it really looks
like he already wound it pretty tight.
(upbeat music)
- Well hello, guys.
My name is Bryan.
Yeah, just your normal, average,
daily vlogger dad, if you will.
Hey, you're not Bryan, I'm Bryan.
Sorry guys, gnome's trying
to steal my thunder.
I found both of these,
sitting in my office today
because apparently, the boys
were playing in the courtyard
and let's just say, that
their safety was compromised.
So, we brought them inside,
so that the boys couldn't break them.
Got this fun surprise in the mail.
It is Zach King's new
book, My Magical Life.
Super awesome for him to send this to us.
I think the boys are going to love this.
He also included some stickers
and I'm really excited
to read this to the boys.
I think it's going to be super fun
and the illustrations are
like, really, really cool
and bright and colorful.
So, thanks, Zach, for thinking of us.
We've always been a big fan
of all the things that
Zach does on the interwebs.
(upbeat music)
I am so excited, Ollie.
Do you know why I'm so excited?
- Because it's almost Halloween.
- That's right, it's
almost Halloween, you guys.
I feel like today we have been focusing
on getting everything ready for Halloween,
because we have some big plans, you guys.
Right?
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah, so we've been
planning Halloween party,
Halloween special, making
sure we have all our costumes,
making sure everything's ready.
- Not to mention, Finn
turns two this month.
- Oh my gosh, yes!
Finn turns two and we're
throwing that party,
like before the Halloween party,
so, there's just so much that
we're planning for this month.
October.
- Halloween.
- Do you hear him?
He's so excited for Halloween.
He's so cute.
So, we've been kind of cooped
up in the house all day,
getting things done, making phone calls,
making appointment, scheduling everything,
so, these boys need to play.
So we're gonna take 'em to play.
Hey, look.
You guys, can see yourself in
the reflection of my sunglasses.
- Let's play!
-  Do you know
where we live, Ollie?
-  Where?
- We live all the way
over here, in California.
Leave a comment down
below with where you live
and then we can see where everyone
who watches our video lives.
Wouldn't that be cool?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Leave it down below.
(techno music)
- Okay, you're going to go
down the big slide, okay?
Say, whee.
-  Look at this cool rock wall.
Can you do it?
Whoa, dude.
Can you go higher, Ollie?
Woah!
That is so cool, dude.
- Hey guys, I'm playing.
Let's do this.
- This place, is so
overwhelming, you guys.
There is so much to do.
It's really crazy how much
there is to do here for all the kids.
I don't even know where Ollie is.
Oh, Finn just went down the slide.
(laughing)
Finn just went down the slide.
That was so funny.
Good job, Finn.
- We're going down the slide.
(Ollie screaming)
-  Nice.
(Missy screaming)
-  Missy is teaching Finn
how to use this little bouncer.
It's so cute.
(Bryan laughing)
That is not how you do it, Finn.
Bounce.
(Finn laughing)
- I think I threw
something out in my back.
-  You got your exercise again?
- Yeah.
- Boo.
-  Whoa.
Finn, You're so scary.
- Boo!
- Oh my gosh, that scared me.
Whoa!
So, Ollie and I just watched
the new Star Wars trailer.
You excited for the movie?
Yes?
And I asked him, should we dress up?
and what did you say Ollie?
- I want to be Darth Vader.
- Are we gonna be bad guys?
Yes?
I bought 10 tickets tonight for Star Wars,
because I am so excited
for the new Star Wars
and it's going to be
Ollie's first big boy movie.
You know that?
- Yeah.
- So, I'm really excited
to be able to go to that with him.
All right, you guys.
We are going to try
something new on this channel
and it is called, Ask Daily Bumps.
♫ Ask Daily Bumps Time
♫ Ask Daily Bumps Time
♫ Ask Daily Bumps
- Ollie learned today that our
channel name was Daily Bumps
Isn't that funny?
- He's so smart.
You guys, we're supposed
to be answering questions
and you're just hugging.
The amount of brotherly
love, right now, though.
I asked you guys, on my Twitter account,
to the use hashtag, Ask Daily Bumps
to ask us a question as a family
and we're going to answer
some of them, right now
and if you're not following us on Twitter,
do it now.

- Florida!
- Florida!
- Florida.
- Daily Bumps Lover asks,
"You have the fish tank,
what pets are next?"
Missy?
- Maybe a goat or a pig?
- Greta asks, "Have you
ever snuck out of the house
"when you were younger,
"or gone somewhere different
than you told your parents?"
Missy?
- 100%, yes.
- Missy actually left work
in the middle of the day
to come to one of my parties.
When her parents went in, ran back.
- I ran back, put my uniform back on,
made them a pizza and then
I went back to the party,
but of course, I got caught.
- All right, Ollie, Haley asks,
"What is your favorite
thing about school?"
- Miss Tracy.
- Aw, you like your teacher?
- Mhm.
- That's cute.
- So cute.
- Annie asked, "Are you going
to be doing anymore music
"and will Missy be in it?"
Yes.
- Yeah.
- We actually have
some really exciting stuff
coming up, with music,
that we're really excited
to share with you guys.
Emily asked, "Will we
be having anymore kids?"
- Will be having anymore kids?
It's funny, because Missy and I, actually,
last night, were just talking about this.
We have decided that,
we definitely are going to
have at least, one more kid.
Yep, for sure.
- For sure.
- And we're excited if it's a boy.
We're excited if it's a girl.
We just know that there's one more
little piece to our family
and it's going to happen,
when it happens.
Hashtag soon?
- Jill asked,
"Are we having another
Halloween party, this year?"
and yes, and I am planning it
and I'm so excited.
It's going to be awesome.
(Bryan howling)
- All right, Ollie.
Sam asked you, "How do you feel about
"being so popular around the world
"and does it affect your
friendships in school?"
You know how people know your name
when we're in public?
- You know how you're like,
oh, that kid knows me!
Do you think that's cool?
- Mhm.
- Yeah.
I don't know how it affects
his friendships at school exactly
but I think, if anything,
it just makes the kids
feel like they know
Ollie and Ollie's like,
cool, let's be friends.
All right, well that is all for this Q&A.
We really, really enjoyed doing this.
-  Yeah that was cool.
- I think even the kids enjoyed it.
Let us know down below, some questions
that you have, and maybe next time,
you'll see your question, in our next Q&A.
It is getting late.
These boys need to go to bed.
Ollie's got school, tomorrow.
I hope you guys, enjoyed today's video.
Make sure you give it a big thumbs up.
- Thumbs up, subscribe, keep coming.
- I will see you guys, tomorrow.
- What do you say?
- Bye.
