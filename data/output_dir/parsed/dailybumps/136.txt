- Say good morning.
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good mornin', good mornin',
good mornin', mornin', mornin'.
Hi Finn!
Say hi!
Say hi!
Say hi!
Say hello.
Good morning guys!
I don't know why Finn's being so shy!
Are you shy?
(chuckling)
Aw.
Good morning guys!
I'm hangin' out with Finn,
in my bedroom, that's the office.
Look at this.
We got a project goin' on.
Check out this new console I have.
I had like some cool shelves down here
but it was all exposed so you could
see all of these wires.
All these ones.
So I bought this,
and it had a brown iron.
So we painted it white to
match the white iron my office.
And I have to set it all up.
But I'm super excited because
this has way more storage
for all of my office stuff.
So it's not gonna be so cluttered in.
And I'm like really into
the '70s vintage thing.
I love the white too.
Looks cool.
Hey Finn, I'm gonna get you!
Ima' gonna get you!
Ima' get you!
Ima' get you!
Ima' get you Finn, Ima' get you!
Ima' get you!
- Finn!
I heard you went and
made videos with auntie.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Was that fun?
(baby talk)
- Yeah, he's sayin' somethin'.
(baby talk)
- Oh really?
- What are you sayin'?
He's like...
(baby talk)
Oh really?
And then what did you do?
- Baba.
- Baba.
But anyways, I wanted to show you guys
the dogs right now, they're outside.
Mostly because the carpet is super clean
and I'm like, can we just keep it clean
for 24 hours before you guys come in
and like trample all over
it with your dirty feet.
But they're so funny
because they literally
can open doors.
And they worked together as a team
to make it happen.
I'm gonna unlock it for them.
They can't unlock the door.
Let's see if they can open it.
Come here Karma.
Come inside.
Come on boy.
He's like looking at the handle.
Come on.
Come on Karm.
Oh my gosh.
Bad dogs.
Karma Chameleon!
You just opened that door.
You guys are bad!
Come here, come on.
Back outside.
Back outside.
There you go.
Luna come.
Is that not hilarious?
Like he does that all day long.
He just opens the door
so that he can come in.
Now if it's locked, he
can't do it but like,
you guys are crazy!
I love my dogs.
They're so smart.
They're such good doggy's huh?
Yeah.
Also it is freezing outside.
It is so cold!
So cool.
All right Finn is down for a nap
and Ollie's still at school.
So me and my mom are
getting our nails done.
I am missing nails guys, I
have not been in, in a while.
So, I'm excited to get a fresh set.
And I'm excited to have nails
that don't look ridiculous.
Look who's up from his nap.
Hey baby.
I just got home, just in
time for him to wake up.
And our nails are done, and look.
I did like almost white.
Which I don't normally do,
'cause it's like fall time
so I wanted to do more
of like a darker color
but I never can decide on a color
and white just seemed easy to pick.
You let my nails--
- If you don't like
you just paint over it.
- Yeah.
But anyways, Finn's up from his nap.
And Ollie asked me today if
Natalia could pick him up
so he could play with Payton.
And so I asked her so, I think she's gonna
pick him up today.
So he's pretty excited I'm sure.
But we'll go pick him up in a little bit.
Look where we're at.
Ollie!
We've missed you all day!
Are you so excited that Tal picked you up?
And you got to come here.
Have you played Doctor Kitty Cat?
Did you really?
Good.
He's been asking to play that all,
for like weeks.
We have just been hanging
out at the Johnson's.
And Ollie's hiding from me right now
'cause I think he knows it's probably
almost time to go home.
And he's like no.
What are you so afraid of bud?
Finn's having a blast too.
Ollie what are you so afraid of?
What's wrong?
Ollie, are you just
worried I'm gonna tell you
it's time to go home?
Yeah.
Well you can't live here!
He's just having such a blast.
But it's almost time to go
and they are like, no, let's stay forever.
I mean I guess if they wanna live here.
I'm gonna tell Tal and Jess.
Hey Ollie would like to
live here now, is that okay?
- Yes.
(laughing)
-  He doesn't want to leave.
All right, they said you can live here.
Do you wanna live here?
- No, no!
-  Oh!
He doesn't wanna live here.
No?
You can sleep in the girls bed.
- Just with you to live here.
-  You want me
to live here, with you?
- All right you guys are movin' in!
- All right we're movin' in!
So you want me to live
here and you live here?
-  Yeah.
- Oh my goodness.
He wants it to be a big old happy family
at the Johnson's.
Can Finn live here too?
- Yeah!
- Yeah.
-  And daddy?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, well.
- And Payton.
-  And Payton?
You get to live here too okay, Pay?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- 'Cause I moved to this house.
I really liked my old house
'cause it had soft stairs.
- Oh it does have soft stairs huh?
All right, I think it's
time to go home boys.
All right!
- Family hug!
- We are leaving.
I convinced 'em.
I convinced them that it's time to go home
with mommy to go see daddy.
So say goodbye to your other family.
-  Bye!
-  Bye boys.
-  Did you guys have so much fun?
-  Can I run down the street?
-  You wanna run
down the street, okay.
- Okay.
Goodnight to the old lady whispering,
hush.
Goodnight stars.
Goodnight air.
Goodnight noises everywhere.

And cuddling.
(gentle guitar music)
Goodnight comb.
And goodnight brush.
And goodnight to the old lady whispering

Goodnight stars.
Goodnight air.
Goodnight noises everywhere.
- The kids are asleep.
And apparently so are the doggies too.
Oh hi Luna.
Hi baby.
She's just chillin'.
Sorry, did I interrupt your slumber?
Okay, get back to it.

dinner for Missy and I.
We got shrimp linguini,
I got broccoli, garlic toast.
The kids are asleep and

'Tis the season of onesies you guys.
Mine is so cool, it's red and black
