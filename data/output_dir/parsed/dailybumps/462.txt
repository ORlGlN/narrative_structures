plain into the chocolate chip I'm a
little sad this morning though because I
checked my eggs - and I basically had
exactly seven eggs not including any of
my actual chickens
yeah and I need eight in order to make
two batches 24 for each loaf so I have
to use one of my chickens eggs for this
batch and I'm kind of sad because I feel
like it's like a waste like I feel like
this one should be eaten by us like an
egg not just like put into a loaf of
bread but I really want to make the
second batch so I'm gonna put a little
tiny egg with my other four mixed it all
together and make a second batch of
pumpkin bread Hey

just know if we were vlogging like I
would know what I would want a vlog

started not funny and then our intro was
all just that we did and I - all even
though you that we didn't fog it yeah oh
those like a lifetime ago and have lunch
at Sonic and Missy was left but they
didn't bring us any salt and she's like
why don't they have salt in that when I
worked at Sonic we always put salt on
the back for people I'm like babe that
was over 10 years ago we're into Sonic
I'm pretty sure things have changed like
it's not even an exaggeration like oh I
was like 10 years ago no that was
actually
ten years ago that I worked this on it
and they used to carries all of them and
that was a really good idea and they
should do that towel because otherwise I
feel really bad as the result name to
pride their skates back to the blades
gets all and they're possibly anisole
which happen to me all the time anyways
