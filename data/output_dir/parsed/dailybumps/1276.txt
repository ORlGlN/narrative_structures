what up what up you guys it is a
beautiful day here in sunny Southern
California not a cloud in the sky this
is our Sun baby
these are my new amazing things
blue skies you guys it is so beautiful
it's like 83 degrees probably a little
chilly to go swimming you seen I've been
talking about that about how like how
long or how much longer we gonna be able
to swimming for because I'm the kind of
person where as long as the water feels
good I don't really care and she's kind
of person that's like I only want to
swim if it's super hot out but the cool
thing about our pool is that it is
heated so could probably swim all
year-round if we just set it up right
you know but I'm running a few errands I
feel like : I'm Bama chick 11:01
starting the vlog in the car he's always
running errands when he when he starts
his vlog and by the way you guys Katie
is getting so big her belly her bowling
her belly is getting big she looks
beautiful but only her bellies can eat
pig it's getting so big and it's getting
so close to seeing little games if you
guys know who I'm talking about
then you need to be subscribed to Bama
chick 1101 I'll have a link below in the
description they're amazing they're
almost at 50,000 so we should totally
just like try and get them to 50,000
because they're amazing they've been
daily vlogging for a while now and
Collin is just hilarious he's like my
brother from another mother miss that
guy I hope that we're able to see them
before another YouTube event just
because I do I miss them I miss all our
friends honestly like all our YouTube
friends they're all like scattered over
the country it's a bummer I wish we all
just lived in one city but if we all
lived in one city than all of our vlogs
would probably be super boring all over
James what are you watching
I don't even know what this is but I
don't think it's appropriate for
children Jake and neverland pirates okay
you can watch that hate crime against
choice oh geez
good morning guys hang on let me just
turn this down so annoying morning
everyone
oh man we have had sort of a late going
but I'll tell you why because I've been
reading Outlander lads and lassies I'm
pretty much obsessed with it right now I
decided to pick up my Outlander book
last night I started at the point where
the show has left off last I pretty much
got totally sucked in
really really loving it I spent like two
hours this morning reading it and I'm
pretty much I think I'm back in the game
because here's the thing I'm a through
and huge fan of the Outlander series I
really am I love the book I love
everything about it
I'm so excited about this series on
television but as a true fan I actually
have not read all the books which
doesn't really make any sense
because I really should read the books
but I've read like all of them up to
like the fifth book and I think there
might be like eight books now I just
kind of got out of the groove of reading
them and then I kind of forgot all the
story but if I were to read the books
that I left off I feel like I'd have to
go back and read the books again because
I don't really remember them I'm gonna
try and read them all again and this
time I'm gonna try and get through the
end of the series I don't know I do have
time when Oliver goes to bed and when he
takes his naps and stuff like that but
anyways we've just been cleaning up oh
did you fall I love watching the vlogs
back because sometimes when we're like
walking we'll see him fall in the
background in the vlog and I'll be like
oh my gosh she just fell and I didn't
even see it because well he falls all
day long but it's just funny when I
don't even notice it
are you okay he's like I'm watching jake
and the neverland I'm so excited you
guys because in Jersey Mike's just
opened up by our house and we've been
loving Jersey actually I've been eating
like nothing with sandwiches lately
basically like Joey from friends now but
I got something a little different I'll
show you guys when we get home but
pretty much starving at this point got
everything I was supposed to I'll do a
little man haul when I get home show you
what I got with the sub safely there
Stacy I am currently on the hunt for the
perfect trashcan because as you guys
know we just been having some trouble
with the trashcan Oliver gets in it a
lot because it doesn't have a lock on it
and karma has been getting into it a
little bit more often I've been seeing
your guys's links you guys have sent us
like a ton of really cool trash cans but
most of them are on Amazon and you have
to order them and I just don't want to
do that so finding some good ones
although they are pretty pricey if you
want like a decent one you guys have
Jersey Mike's where you're from is it
only a California thing cuz I don't know
if I remember it being in Idaho although
I mean we left Idaho like four years ago
can when is it finally where we
can stop talking about Idaho because
yeah I think is this our third year or a
fourth year since we moved I'm not sure
basically I was just so sick a subway
and at Jersey Mike's they like cut the
meat and the cheese right onto your
bread so I always thought that was
pretty cool so it's like super super
fresh if you ever want to know how to
make this kid laugh this is how you do
it
I just never gonna make you check it out
guys I got myself a chicken parm it's
like a hot sandwich with chicken and
provolone and stuff it's really good
check it out he's got a club sub and of
course the best chips in the world
wavy raisin lanch wavy lays ranch
yeah said that right yeah these are
amazing I like this sour cream cheddar
all right did friend working hard he's
putting up fly traps because we just got
somebody flies 21 over there where
Karma's supposed to go poop that way
obviously flies are attracted to poop if
they're attracted to poop then they'll
be over there and then they'll get
caught in the little my trap
he has just been going to town doing
chores I inside I just got done sweeping
the kitchen now I got a mop I don't know
I feel like I should do this like every
other day and usually I do it at night
when Oliver is asleep but I just put
Oliver down for a nap because he was
holy moly grouchy like holy crap he went
down for now
and I was like well I just do it now and
then maybe I can relax tonight and not
have to sweep in mop and stuff like that
so so that's what I'm doing right now
man Hall time you ready first thing I
got today
a new hose it sucks it already kinked up
like because it eats Congress I think we
just need one of the things that the
hose are actually wraps around to keep
it like contained I went by Petco and I
got this stuff for karma because we have
grass over there he that he likes to
poop on the rocks over there which is
not cool because we I like walk over
there to like do the pool and stuff in a
ball is poop and I put all his poop over
there on the grass and then I sprayed
this potty here stuff which they told me
it's got like these pheromones and like
stuff for dogs to smell like so they'll
want to poop there so I sprayed that all
over where I want him to poop and then I
attached this to the hose and I sprayed
down that area which basically gets rid
of all the scents and smells so he
basically like forgets to do it we've
been having a bit of a fly situation so
I put one of this flytrap these actually
work really well so I put one over there
and then I put one on the other end of
the patio I know it's kind of like a
summer thing and they'll go away
eventually but there's a really big
nuisance and then also while hose at
Lowe's I got this Weber kickin chicken
seasoning because I like all different
kinds of seasoning maybe I want a cookie
and I won't I won't eat these one this
time okay remember when I that was a
long time ago when I actually tried to
eat okay come here
here shake shake on it okay now you can
have a cookie my candles almost gone
look how much I have left like barely
anything it's like barely even staying
lit we really like this one I just
picked it up from Target I don't even
think it necessarily has like a brand I
couldn't find one at least because I
really like the wick I just think it's
really long and cool-looking probably
lasted like almost a week it's not the
longest a candle has ever lasted for me
but I've also been using it like crazy
we are in desperate need of a good trash
can so we're doing some real world
testing here okay Ali's got his bottle
Holly oh look at you can lift that one
huh
oh that one's easy yeah let's not get
that one I'm going to put his bottle in
there make sure it closes all the way
try and get it is it baby-proof isn't
gonna work can you do it
oh can you do it no you can't cuz it
looks like this is the lid but it's
actually inset like inside you need to
put like your fingernails the cheese and
he won't use this is riveting
I'm sure pouring adult things and it's
finest right here you guys oh yeah I
probably should give it Matt here you go

same price as that other one we were
looking at Target and still can't get

he's been eating really good and
sleeping really good but then when she
wakes up he's just like grouchy I don't
know what his deal is maybe he just
doesn't really feel good today and for
those of you wondering about the weaning
process like I said I'm trying to go
really gradual with it but we are
definitely it's happening slowly but
surely it's definitely a work in process
progress and our biggest struggle is

relaxation right before bed and I do too
