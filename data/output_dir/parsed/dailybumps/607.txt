what is going on back here got a kitty
cat hey kitty cat wherever you are
that's whatever wanna be that big
I am
very
good morning guys
well it is not quite morning for these
boys they are down for their first nap
and yes we are at Target look at this
all ice in this scarf in is in this cart
and yes I had a feeling that Finn was
going to be taking a nap so I brought
him specifically in his baby carrier
because then I knew I could just pick up
the carrier and put into a car I don't
know why I just don't keep them in the
baby carrier because I think it's way
more convenient than the big boy car
seat but they're asleep say nice we're
going to shop I'm here with my mom and
dad shopping for one of their guest
rooms they need get some stuff for my
guest room so like I said we were
shopping for my mom and dad's guest room
and we just picked out this kind of
simple white bed set they just painted
the rooms like grey and they got a new
bed that's like a dark grey so we're
thinking kind of a light color so kind
of lighting it up then got a little blue
throw blanket and look who's up Finn
decided to just wake up your brother
decided to stay sleep maybe it was who's
in charge of him dad's like I kept my
kid asleep carefully why he's like the
easiest when he's awake and he's
probably easiest to keep asleep as well
so now I shouldn't got a few decor
pieces kind of exciting though we're
decorating their guest room because now
they have guest room because they have
no kids
good morning glorious people of the
internet look at my hair

myself so Missy actually took the kids
today and she's gonna get some stuff

done yay my inbox has been filling up I

guys already know all right I would say
that was a successful trip to target now
we're gonna go to media Pappas and help
them set it all up always got a little
chocolate milk I got myself a ice try
some Starbucks which I've been really
into lately kids were so good I'm so
proud of them it was a nice peaceful
trip hey stick that back in there put it
back in there now you're gonna spill
your drink right now
thank you hey you're welcome all right
check it out this is their guest room
right now we're about to transform it
into a beautiful guest room
this is actually Cassie's room before
and I'll know if you guys remember but
it was bloody neon green neon green
because she is the nicest mom and I will
admit like they moved into this house
and my sister Wanda painted a color and
I thought she was crazy for yeah for
letting my like my sister do that but
she did my mom did let me color my room
a crazy color ones what color the orange
mom and green
yep they all do it there's about a happy
time here yes just to cover it
yes she had a black racing stripe and
neon green on the walls oh like you are
crazy but they they just painted it all
themselves they got this new bed they
she redid these these were like her beds
and tables and she like stands them down
and did all that so that was pretty cool
but yeah we're gonna transform it right
now we're gonna show you how
all right who's ready for the big reveal
I love it it looks so cute it's not
quite done there's still a couple balls
we need stuff for but it looks really
good here it is yeah so we just got this
cream bedding with a nice throw we've
got some browns and grays that we're
trying to go for this pillow is so soft
and comfy we put some lights back there
which I love and it's easy to just like
unplug from right here and then we're
gonna grab something probably to go back
behind there and then we ended up
putting picture there and it's just like
somewhere for them to like hang like
their towels and I don't know I like it
I think it looks really cute and I love
that says welcome and life is sweeter
with friends and family because
obviously this is a guest room and then
on this side we ended up putting
curtains up behind front of the closet
because we put a dresser in there for
people to use and it's kind of nice but
with doors on the closet you can't get
into the dresser so I like it I think it
looks fine so we saw this entire wall to
self but I figured Hobby Lobby would
probably be a better place to get stuff
like that can you can get like a little
thing and maybe we'll do like a collage
of cute little like signs and stuff I
love it and it looks so cute we got
these at Target basically everything
from here is in Target so that's kind of
cool

think they're really pretty and cute
