- And then the next thing I remember,
Missy holding me, and Missy asking me,
"Do you know what happened?"
Like, "Do you know what happened?"

- Good morning!
We are at school today!
Do you know what letter
you're learning today?
- No.
-  I told you earlier, what was it?
- I don't remember!
- Oh, it's the letter "Q".
- "Q"
- Like, "Quick!"
And "Quack!"
(laughs)
Not very many words that start with a "Q".
- Quacker?
- Quacker.
(laughs)
That's a "C"
"Cracker!"
It is very confusing.
Anyways, we are off to school
and I've got some errands to run today,
so I'm gonna drop him off.
I did not do my hair today.
(groans)
It's a mess.
We're going to hurry up and get to school
and then Mama's off!
Kay?
- Okay.
-  Let's go!
Alright, have a good day, 'kay?
- 'Kay.
-  I love you.
- I love you too.
-  Go play!
So I am headed in to the big horse store
to grab a few things.
He just needs some probiotics
that the vet was talking about
I don't know. It's always
fun to look around.
And then I need some
breakfast. I need to eat!
I'm so hungry.
So I have been looking
at all of these pads,
because Nacho has such high withers that
I was kinda thinking
about getting a pad with
wither relief. But, I
think I'm gonna wait.
Today, he actually has a massage.
I'm wondering if maybe it's
not so much that he has
the problem with the withers
but maybe just another Oz Fox.
He's just very uncomfortable
with my Western saddle,
so hopefully we can get
that figured out today.
But I did get my probiotics!
And I got Bryan some gloves
because it's been so cold,
and I want him to come up
there and do stuff with Nacho,
but it's just so cold, and
I'm the only one with gloves.
Alright, we're ready to head off.
(upbeat electronic music)
- (babbling)
-  Good morning,
Finn! What are you doing?
- I'm playing!
-  Did you build
that giant, tall, tower?
- Yeah!
-  That's amazing, dude!
Good morning, guys!
Finn is chillin' in my
office this morning.
I'm gonna admit, I probably
have kicked the boys
out of my office a couple
times, when I'm trying to work.
But on chill days,
when I'm just checking
and answering emails,
I love when Finn can come into my office
and grab toys, and play at my desk.
It's so cool!
Look at this cool tower, dude!
- (babbles)
-  Yeah!
- Watch this!
- Okay
That means "Watch this."
Whoa!
(crashes)
(laughing)
- Wow!
-  It fell down here!
He tried to crack it on the table,
That didn't really work out, did it buddy?
-  Yeah.
- So, if you guys follow
me on social media,
you probably saw a post a while ago
about an incident we had at the house.
It was something that we're
still trying to figure out.
It was something that-
(crashes)
we don't really have all
the answers, but I think,
now, we're at a point
where we could probably
share some of that with you.
It was a really scary
thing that happened to us,
and to me, and Missy.
And I will never forget it.
(crashes)
And we still have lot to figure out,
but today I think it
going to be a good day
for Missy and I to share
that with you guys.
So, she's out running errands,
and I'm just hanging out doing
some work with the kiddo,
then we'll probably be able
to talk about it a little bit
in this vlog.
Finn, you need to learn
not to throw your Legos.
(laughs)
They're all scattered everywhere.
Look at his concentration,
though, when he combines these.
So funny.
Good job, dude!
- So I am back from my
horse getting a massage.
Bryan's actually doing some
song-writing and stuff.
(piano playing)
Finn is wearing Ollie's shirt.
And I wanted to give you
a a quick update on Nacho.
He definitely had some
areas that were painful,
so she worked through some of those,
and it's just good to know,
I don't think it's my saddle,
so that's good to know.
He is just a little
bit sore in some areas,
and hopefully that really helps,
and I know I definitely need
to get his teeth done next.
Alright, we're gonna go get Ollie.
You ready to go get Ollie?
- Yeah!
-  You're gonna wear his shirt?
- Yeah!
-  'Kay, let's go!
Hi bud!
(soft guitar music)
(babbling)
Finn really wanted Ollie to
take him down the slide, so-
Did you show him your play set?
Whee!
Is that so fun?
Wow, look at that!
Aren't these fun?
Maybe next year you'll
be able to ride these.
- I ride a bike, and it was hard.
-  Oh, was it hard?
- Yeah.
- We are home now, and I
thought that we should finally
give the story of something
that happened to Bryan
the other day.
He tweeted about it, so a lot
of people have been asking
about what's going on.
So I'm gonna let Bryan
explain what happened,
and his experience, and
then I'll explain mine.
But what happened?
- So I woke up early in the morning
and I remember having to go
to the bathroom, very badly.
So, I woke up, I sprang out of
bed, I went to the bathroom,
and as I was going to the bathroom,
I started to get very light-headed.
And then things started
to blur a little bit.
And then I remember thinking,
"I think I'm gonna fall."
And then the next thing
I remember are, like,
these scattered memories
with divisions in-between
of, like, Missy holding me,
and Missy asking me,
"Do you know what happened?
Do you know what happened?"
I think, at that point,
I was going in and out
of consciousness.
The next thing I remember,
I was laying on the floor
Missy was over me and
she wanted to call 911,
and I was so confused as to
why she wanted to call 911
'cause, to me, nothing bad had happened.
I felt like maybe I tripped, or something.
- Fell, or something. Yeah.
- Yeah, so she calls 911,
they were there pretty quick.
(laughs)
Before I knew it, I had a
ton of people around me,
asking me questions,
and there's equipment that
they're attaching to me,
and it was all-
it kinda felt like I
was dreaming, in a way.
It was not fun.
(laughs)
For sure.
I was very cold, and shaking,
they had to put blankets on me
- Probably a lot of anxiety.
- I definitely had a lot of anxiety,
'cause more and more people
just kept coming into my bedroom
and I'm like,
I'm not even sure what
I'm wearing at this point.
(laughs)
But yeah, it was nerve-racking.
And I think Missy should
give her side of the story.
- Yeah, I can kinda fill in a
lot of the holes, basically,
of what he's talking about.
It was very early in the morning
and I was up with Finn, 'cause
he woke up at, like, 6 AM
And Karma needed let out so I said,
"Bryan, go let Karma out!"
So he gets up, let's Karma
out, he goes to the bathroom,
and, oh my gosh, he was peeing forever!
(laughs)
I swear, like, a minute straight.
I was just sitting with
Finn, and all of a sudden,
I look up and he starts
falling straight back.
And I'm like, "Oh my gosh,
Bryan, are you okay?"
And I look at him, and he's
actually, like, seizing.
What it looks like is
like shaking, seizing,
like, moving, twitching like crazy.
And I jump out of bed,
and I run over to him,
and I grab him.
And I'm like, "Bryan! Bryan!"
And I'm trying to fumble with
my phone, 'cause I don't know
when, exactly, he's gonna wake up.
And he sort of wakes up at that
moment, and he looks at me,
and he's like, "Wait what?"
I think he thinks, at that moment,
that he sleptwalked, maybe.
And I was like, "Bryan, do
you know what happened?"
"Do you know what happened?"
And he sits up, and then
he flies backwards again,
and he starts seizing again.
And, I mean, it was like
eyes open, twitching.
It was really scary looking.
To me, I was like,
"Oh my god, he's having
seizures right now."
He basically, at this point,
had hit his head twice
pretty hard, flying backwards.
- My head did hurt.
- Yeah. And so, once he
woke up from that one
I was like, "Don't get up! Don't get up!"
And I kinda dragged his head
over to where the carpet was
just in case it happened again.
And he was struggling
to get up and I said,
"Don't get up! Don't get up!"
And, at this point, he
still is very confused
on what's going on.
I don't think he's totally
there at this point.
And I'm like, "I'm calling 911."
And so I call 911, and I
tell them what happened,
and they say, "Don't let him
get up. He needs to lay there."
And so, they're like, "We'll
have someone there right away."
And he starts shaking
like crazy, and he's cold.
And so I start throwing
tons of blankets on him.
And, at this point, I'm
crying and I'm calling my mom,
and I'm like, "Someone come up here!"
Ollie's still in bed so I
didn't want him to see anything,
and I sent Finn into the
room to go relax on the bed
until my mom gets there.
Paramedics get there,
and after hooking him up,
his blood pressure, at
this point, was good.
He, at this point, was all there.
'Cause, for a while, he
wasn't talking normal,
he was kinda like, "No,
don't call 911. I just fell."
He doesn't know at all what's going on.
And so, after they really looked him over,
they said that he just
fainted, or passed out.
We're pretty sure it
because either he stood up
or, there's even this thing called a,
I forget the word.
But basically you put a
lot of pressure on your bum
'cause he was peeing for so long,
it can drop your blood pressure.
And when you faint from
your blood pressure
dropping so quickly
you have what looks like
seizure-type characteristics
of fainting.
- Yeah.
- So, he didn't have a seizure.
- I don't think I had a seizure.
I definitely think I fainted.
I felt really light-headed
the rest of the day,
every time I stood up,
so I kinda could feel it.
And, I don't know, we have
a doctor's appointment
so I think they're gonna
check my brain and see
what's going on in there.
- Brain, heart.
- Yeah, I feel pretty
confident that I fainted,
the paramedics felt very
confident that I fainted,
it's not an uncommon thing.
We weren't too worried,
they had an ambulance ready
to come pick me up,
but I don't think there was any use.
They said, "if you really wanted
confirmation, we could go."
But we have a doctor's
appointment set for later.
- I will say that I think
I'm a little more traumatized
about what happened than he is.
He doesn't really remember.
But it was very, very, scary.
- Yeah, it was scary.
- I think Bryan has a lot of anxiety now
about going to the bathroom.
- Yeah, I definitely am
watching myself a little closer
- And I'm walking behind him with pillows.
(laughs)
- Hopefully we get some answers soon.
- Yeah.
- But seriously, you guys do
not have to worry about me.
I feel like I am completely fine,
we're gonna get everything
figured out eventually.
So, just wanted to let you guys know that,
to ease your minds a
little bit. Bryan is okay.
- And I'm just so glad he's okay!
- I'm not going anywhere yet, people!
I gotta lot more to do.
But anyway, I think we're
gonna end the vlog with that.
Thank you guys for
watching, big thumbs up.
(ding)
- Big thumbs up for Bryan being okay.
- Thanks again, guys. And we'll
see you in our next video.
Bye!
