-  Good morning
and happy Easter.
- Yay, it's Easter morning, huh?
Yes it is Easter morning
and as you can tell
I've got mine...
I've got barn hair and
I don't care hat on.
Which means you're headed to the barn
but first I think the
Easter Bunny came, huh?
- Yeah.
- So we are looking for...
- We gotta them Easter baskets?
-  Good morning.
- Good morning, daddy.
- Good morning.
- Happy Easter.
- Happy Easter.
Happy Easter.
(kid screaming)
- Wait guys, do you wanna see this?
- Is it like a hat?
Oh my gosh, it is like a hat.
It's like one of those hats
from the guards in London, Ollie.
- We gotta find our Easter Bunny basket.
So...
We gotta start looking in
all the good hiding places
in the house, where do we like to hide?
Alright, we are on a mission
to go find our Easter basket.
And I thought I saw something this morning
when I was cold.
-  Whoa!
-  Oh my goodness!
-  What's this?
- Candy and coloring.
- That's so cool it's a
Crayola Easter basket.
-  That is so neat.
- There you go, Ollie,
that one's yours, buddy.
Alright Finny, now you gotta
try to find your, okay?
-  Um yeah, so Finn?
I was changing a diaper this morning
and I thought I saw a
little peek of something?
-  Where do we
change your diaper at, Finn?
-  Is it in there?
- No.
-  What is it?
Whoa!
- That's awesome!
- This is huge.
Look at this is almost
as big as you are, Finn.
-  Is that so neat?
- That's crazy.
-  Well that's so
nice of the Easter Bunny.
- He's got Peeps.
I'm sure he'll share those with you, okay?
-  I think both of
you can share together.
- And cotton candy and sand toys.
- Like we can go to the
beach and we can play.
- Yeah!
- Yay!
- Happy Easter boys.
I know.
- So fun.
Easter is such a fun little...
- They are so in to this.
- I know.
Alright guys, we are actually heading out
so we're gonna come
back and play with these
in a little bit, okay?
- No.
-  He's like, I'm
taking this with me, mom.
Um...
When did you get so smart
at buckling yourself in?
This is crazy.
Oh my gosh.
You did it.
You just buckled yourself
in all by yourself.
I'm so proud of you.
Oh my gosh.
It is so crazy to have
a little kid of mine
buckling himself in to the car seat.
You're basically like a grown man now.
Alright so like I said, it is Easter
and me and Bryan are
going on a trail ride.
- Doing a little Easter trail.
-  And we're with
Maria, who's on Asher.
And Travis is on Rusty.
And yeah, this is so nice.
- This is insane.
This is like a grass field
we're going through right now.
- Yeah, and this is so fun.
I love going on trail rides
and it's so fun to be
able to do it with Bryan.
And it's nice because me
and him went on a trail ride
the other day and it was pretty stressful.
And now we've got the
support of our friends
who are a little more experienced.
Yeah, we're in a really
cool little field area.
I just love this area in town.
We can just ride wherever
and there's so much scenery
and pretty stuff.
And we're gonna run now, okay bye.
Alright so Bryan's horse Salty has decided
he doesn't wanna go any further.
- Turned into a pony now.
(laughing)
-  He's just a little stubborn.
(laughing)
-  Looking good Bryan.
(laughing)
-  Made it to a water bowl.
Look at him sucking down water.
Is that good, Nacho?
(playful music)
We're having some Easter cookies and wine
out here on the trail with our horses.
- She's being so good, he just sits here.
-  I think he
wants to try the wine.
-  Yeah.
- Would you stop.
-  Rusty keep
knocking over the bottle.
Does Asher like the cookies?
- I think so.
-  Hey, hey, those are ours.
- If you're gonna be my horse
you have to like my cookies.
-  Yeah you gotta try
momma's chocolate chip cookies.
- He doesn't really
like any kind of bread.
- He doesn't like it.
-  Rusty does, he's
like oh yeah, those are good.
- It's so funny.
He's a picky eater just like you, babe.
-  Look at this two.
(laughing)
Are you kidding me.
- He's like no, here you go.
- Alright, I'm gonna try to get my horse,
you wanna try Missy's cookies?
Oh yeah.
-  Oh good.
Okay.
(laughing)
So I think we got two, oh they're hugging.
(laughing)
I think did Asher liked the cookies?
- No.
-  No, okay.
So we got two out of four.
You don't like my cookies.
That's okay.
He really liked it.
Alright we are now at a little
get together with the family.
Jessica's house.
And the Easter Bunny
just came to the house.
Whoa!
We're gonna go get the kids
because the Easter Bunny was just here
and he dropped off all these eggs,
and now the kids gotta
go collect all the eggs
so that mommy can eat all the candy.
CJ, Bailey, Ollie?
You guys.
You're never gonna guess.
- Guess who just got here?
I'm excited.
They don't know what's going on.
-  Come on you guys.
Come on, come on, come on.
Guess who's here?
Or guess who came.
The Easter Bunny came.
You guys gotta go pick a basket.
Finny, where are you?
Come down.
Come on.
The Easter Bunny came, come on.
You're gonna miss, well...
This is your grand
entrance right here, huh?
Come see, come see.
You gotta go collect all the eggs, kay?
Go go go.
Go go go.
Okay, go go go.
Go collect the eggs.
Wow.
The Easter Bunny brought
so many eggs, huh?
How neat.
Oh my gosh.
You're getting so many.
Bailey.
Your basket's already full.
Wow, you got another egg.
Go go go go go.
You guys are crazy.
You're getting all of them.
CJ, don't get any splinters in your feet.
- I don't care if I get splinters.
-  You need all
the candy, all the eggs.
Wow, Finn, you got a big one too.
Oh my goodness, your basket's almost full.
Olivia, you finding all the eggs?
-  She's got plenty of them.
-  She's got plenty.
Wow.
Whoa!
You did so good.
That's so much candy.
Can mommy have it all?
(laughing)
He's like I don't wanna say no but no.
The boys, this is like
their third Easter egg hunt
at this point and they're basically pros.
Good job, Ollie.
Finn, are you jumping?
- Yeah.
-  Oh my goodness.
Oh Olivia can jump really good.
Woo!
Look at that, Finny.
Oh here goes CJ.
Woo, there you go.
Ollie's here.
Ready Ollie, go!
Bailey's here.
Oh, look at that.
Okay, let me see.
So many kids!
Woo!
Good job.
Ollie, you're so cute.
(laughing)
- Dead man, dead man, come alive.
Come alive and chase in time.
One, two, three, four, five.
(kids screaming)
-  Ah, they got you.
CJ won.
- You have to be zombies.
-  That is...
I wanna play!
- Come alive.
Come alive on the count of five.
Come alive.
-  Oh so they're zombies?
What's even happening right now?
(kids screaming)
Eat him!
(kids yelling)
Oh no, Finn!
She got you!
Alright boys.
Did you guys have the best Easter ever?
-  Yeah!
- Yeah.
They got to play at the barn.
And they got to play with
their cousins all day.
They've had like three Easter egg hunts.
I don't understand why
Easter is the holiday
we celebrate three times.
Why don't we celebrate
Christmas three times?
No, I love Easter.
We had such a great holiday, didn't we?
Now you guys have these
big huge basket, Finn.
This basket is just as big as you are.
I know, there's tons
of candy in it, right?
