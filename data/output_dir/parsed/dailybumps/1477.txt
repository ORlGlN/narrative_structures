the parents with newborn parking look at
this
Ali's food being which way it really

and we decided to practice the whole
convertible beginning convertible car
seat so we'd have to take him out we
were like sleeping let's just see if you
stay sleeping and he totally is yeah
whenever we pick him up my swear I
always just like wakes up but I did it
right yeah good job looking at different
car seats there's like a bazillion kind
a lot of people suggested the diono
radian rxt that's this one and at first
I was like yeah I want it but now I'm
looking I don't like it just not it
doesn't look okay that's an extra
attachment to recline it - yeah well
also the Kiko
it was cool not Chico oh is Kiko I still
call it cheap oh yes next fit and it's
really cool because how far it requires
it's really easy to recline yeah it goes
it does not rise it's really smushy
comfortable but also an easy texture
like clean up you know
yeah we can rear face until 40 palms
yeah so it's known as extended row faces
yeah we want to see a minute though but
look at him he's so speaking huh it's so
cute no rhythm I guess it's nap time
do we just wait let's go I am in a crib
let's go shoppin hello good morning
Heidi's house is very bright do you like
the colors to it out so happy nigga yeah
are you standing you like this crib
should we get this done for you here we
go guys always using a big boy seat now
look at him how cool is this babe he's
like I can get my toe still and this
thing is awesome like it's got this new
thing it's cut what's what's the strap
thing called it's like a super cinch
force multiplying latch tightener super
Sikh stupa cinch
so this thing is like solid it is like
in there you guys so it's not we
couldn't we can't put it in the middle
because it has to use a latch system and
so and this thing's cool too that you
just push this button it goes up and
down and then it makes it so it there
cuz these these need to be at or below
his shoulders so we just literally push
this button and then push it down and it
lowers it so that's like way easy now
we're moving over here these are tiny
bees in it big boy Steve he's in his big
boy senior growing up too fast buddy
everyone's yelling at you to slow down
so earlier we gave our dog karma away
but it's okay because we're gonna pick
up our new dog decided to pick up our
new puppy maybe City was a big Italian
song oh very good
ha hey boyo gamma-gamma
got me yet you want one of these antlers
should we get one of these for you if
you don't like it it's okay we won't get
it for you what do you think
did your dad work are they going karma
what do you think you want to get a
sweater you want to be a sweater puppy
look is this cutest thing I really like
there's also this one thread but there's
no a little tight
he's an extra-large straw birds oh yeah
maybe we shouldn't put him near the
brick I'm sweater in a bowl he was
pretty traumatized you guys so we have
to reward him come on
so I'm eating some leftover spaghetti
and I've just been working on the
computer and I finally booked our plane
to Orlando so it's official the landings
will be in Orlando Florida in March
we're actually going for playlist live
and we're staying an extra day to do
Wizarding World but we have a situation
you guys and we don't know what to do
it's very confusing we didn't think
about oh I don't know here's the thing
oli uses a car seat we actually just got
him a brand new convertible car seat
today we need to figure out how to
travel with that because it's fine if we
can like take it on the plane or check
it at the gate or whatever when we get
to the airport we can get a car and we
can go from there to the hotel that's
fine we're staying in a hotel but what
do we do when we go to Wizarding World
because it's like a huge car seat and we
need to get like a car from our hotel to
the Wizarding World of Harry Potter ten
minutes away it's a ten minute drive
away and we're gonna have a car seat and
a stroller cuz obviously he's gonna sit
in the stroller right yeah yeah it's the
weirdest thing
yeah so we have to figure out what to do
I see can Wizarding World check a car
seat for us if you guys know let us know
in the comments how we can get through
this cuz I'm really like what but some
type of car transportation that lets you
borrow a car seat oh you could like rent
a car or something that has a car
have to rent a car because we literally
yeah we'd have to go get the car yeah
it'd be a real pain in the butt if we
want to rent a car just for that day
minutes yeah cuz the whole day we're
gonna be at where's being paroled yeah
so we don't know what to do
does the bus for the bus is like two
hours it's like yeah to take a bus which
is a ten minute drive is actually two
and a half hours of transportation
because you have to walk get on the bus
and like it's way confusing I was like
we're not I'm not taking my son on a bus
in Orlando Florida yeah and we get to
whizzing where we only want the stroller
because he's gonna be eight months and
he's gonna want to just sit in a
stroller why did that I don't want a car
seat at all
a shuttle shuttle from we still need a
book it's very confusing you guys help
us out how do people do this I don't I
can't imagine people walking around
Wizarding World with a huge car seat
right they don't do that you're gonna go
and they're gonna say you're a wizard
Ollie
he's all clean he's got some fresh PJs
on and we're gonna read him a book what
do you want me to read you ollie Freddy
I work really hard for this okay well I
suck I always do that I'm sorry if
reason we could have used this tomorrow

like an ounce though today we're going
to be reading Holly in honor of you
ollie is waiting those are literally the
same picture Gazi and Gertie have been
waiting for weeks for Ollie to come out
we waited weeks for you to come out to
you know that I won't come out says
Ollie I feel like you're not really into
the story as much as I'm devoting myself
to it and it's kind of disrespectful
then he begins cracking all he's cranky
I'm out he says all right that was very
uneventful it's weird like they really
dragged it on all right Missy is now
feeding Ollie and putting him to bed
would you look at this you guys look at
this
I brought my beer kit out and I was like
I'm doing just to do and then I did it
cuz I suck um yeah I'm gonna put an end
