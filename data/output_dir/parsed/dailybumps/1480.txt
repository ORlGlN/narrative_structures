was crazy we were all over the city have
like no energy I actually fell asleep
while editing a blog you guys I was
laying
yeah I was laying in bed editing the
vlog and I literally woke up with my
face on the keyboard but stop paying
yourselves that pain yourself so yeah
yesterday was a little crazy night I had
so much fun like I can't seriously we
made so many memories and you were a
trooper you just stuck by us and had so
much fun you rode the trolley car
yesterday bro like that he doesn't
usually happen to you're much much older
but yeah I think we're gonna try and
find another spot to hit up today
because our plane doesn't actually leave
until 3:00 so we get some more fun inkay
these are very slobbery I got this
beanie a couple years ago and it's
actually Kelsey's and we've been joking
around about it because I pretty much
stole it but I didn't steal it
she just forgot it at my house and then
I wear it every once in a while and I
forget to give it back to her and
there's even been a time when I was like
Kelsey I have your beanie and then I she
had it and she loved it at my house so
anyways I'm gonna go give it back to her
right now
hey Kelsey your beanie
it lost beanie I just wanted to travel
and do things without you thank you what
an amazing morning look at this view and
it feels so good out here
once again our amazing view at the
marina right down there we actually
almost stayed on a boat because you can
do that with Airbnb
come on rental buses boats like craziest
parts of the world that you can imagine
but it is a little cramped last day in
San Francisco you guys can't believe we
got to spend the last of year 1 and the
start of year 2 in this city you know
what I mean so much fun we made so many
memories it's gonna make a couple more
before plane takes off so this morning
we are at mer woods mer Mirror Mirror
Mirror Mirror mu IR I'm not sure but
look they actually have charging ports
for electric cars like we're in a forest
and there's two charging ports for an
electric car so cool
they're really with the times so we're
at muir woods and we're gonna do some
hiking and see if we can't run into a
couple redwoods
we got Ollie on the back chilling out
here is I'm guessing like a topography
of the area can't Canyon coastal view
look at this cool little forest what is
this a forest for ants this needs to be
at least three times the size and so it
begins these big old trees you guys I
guess they have like this little
boardwalk thing because redwood trees
they grow out the roots do and you can't
step on them cuz it's bad for the trees
so we get to walk on this really cool
like boardwalk thing that's a big tree I
mean it's okay
that means under write home about just
get egg whoa is that like for real yeah
nineteen ninety nine eighty ones on
Aztecs Columbus Declaration of
Independence oh my gosh

Games you stole that that and then she
like whistles back what pretty stinkin
massive you guys look at this tree like
dirty and gross it's really cool how
little yeah and look at it like it's
actually like up these spiraled ridges
in it it's nice like crazy
sleep on this you could sleep like right
there right right there trees usually
grow from seeds but redwoods grow from
burles it's like a chunk of them and
then a new tree like pops up from it
that's like science crap right there
crazy yeah it's crazy that's nothing
so that bird that's like a burrow and
like another tree could grow from that
that's crazy guys look at this it almost
looks like a nest or something is it
like tree cancer that's so crazy it's
expecting how many weeks would you say
that is Missy from experience
Missy's found a new home are URI
she's such a rebel how'd that feel
there's one inside of trying you just
violated that tree you know that right
no I have a rush right now

clovers you guys like here's my hand
that crazy
oh wait huh oh I got I saw that for
thought I saw four leaf tons of clovers
everywhere even the clovers are big this
is so beautiful like the air just feels
so nice and like if you go to San
Francisco go to more woods it's the
place to be this has got the draw crow

refuge protect its natural soundscape in

he kept flipping out oh my god
we you oh yeah going home we're gonna

the whole trip
so from a plane to a shuttle now I
headed back to our car but I actually
wrote down a list of all the things we
did in San Francisco this is all are you
ready we drove across the Golden Gate
Bridge like 20 times we ate fish and
chips in the marina walked to Pier 39
visited Fisherman's Wharf clenched out
on a bowl we got cookies from Bowden
which we really wanted to get some
before we left but we kind of meet up at
this two point
visited Alcatraz wrote the ferry he
Britos the mission
Missy exemptions of the flying pig was
really good we visited Union Square
downtown
we took a trolley to Ghirardelli Square
ate chocolate at Ghirardelli Square and
then took the trolley back to Union
Square we ate in Little Italy LS yeah
it's so good and then we hiked through
the redwood trails that was quite a
vacation I think we pushed ourselves so
we really did bodies are aching I
literally am so smart I'm buddy I can't
imagine well I mean Oliver's being
carried off I'm sure I'm fine why will I
sleep all day when we going again skin
it yeah already mrs. Kelsey
Oh baby I was a really good occasion but
I'm excited to be home it's always nice
in convocation but it's also nice going
home sleeping in your bed and from the
shuttle to the car we are friendly on
our way home is pretty much a great trip
great flight actually and I'm really
surprised all are sleeping pretty
because he slept for a good hour and a
half for the flight and now it's like a
two-hour drive home it's funny because
the flight is actually shorter than the
drive home like it actually takes us
longer to get home from the airport and
from San Francisco to the airport which
is kind of funny so exhausting I can't
wait to go home and take like longest
shower and
my robe go to bed bye well karma
exciting oh my god I am so excited to
see her I cannot wait to see how it I
don't even know if I really got a chance
to say goodbye to him and I felt really
about what I was like oh I didn't think
about it
I noticed by the same time I just these
are other baby and we just forgot about
him well we made it home I will say it
was quite traumatizing there tilt
towards the end yeah you telling on me
it hit for the last hour you basically
cried he was really upset but I didn't
blame him because he'd been asleep
through the whole plane ride and then
you slept for an hour drive and he was
just like done he was like I want to go
play I want to do stuff I want to get
out of this trapped mobile huh annoying
