the back of his crib because that's our
room right there he doesn't miss he
wakes up to a pounding of him like hey
come get me
hold on the gorilla who then do the
monkey woohoo welcome to the day you
like hang out I went to the colorway
that's all cool wait a little bit more
that was the sound of us fast-forwarding
the day to now hi hi guys how's it going
we are outside and we were just eating
lunch I've been getting a lot done today
today's our ketchup date yesterday was
kind of like a relaxing day but we're
taking a break and eating some lunch
look at all these eating outside
checking out karma in the pool I'm left
over mahi that stuff was good and we
even trying to eat some mashed potatoes
and the watermelon to love someone he's
such a good eater you guys yeah what do
you want you want my lap Dino nuggets
don't what you put your temperature have
to put it in correlation to the screen
rah
this is seem look like a t-rex that is
so late you also got a big bag of fruit
here we've been eating so much fruit you
guys we did this watermelon
oh I'm still got blend there it goes on
the ground turn
oh no he isn't so much trouble now you
guys leave what are we gonna do when we
have two kids yesterday we talked about
it we're having another kid how are we
gonna do this you're gonna be in charge
of Oliver I get to take over Ollie it's
not fair what if the new kid likes to
cuddle Ollie don't like to cut all you
can just cuddle the new kid okay
technically you'll probably take over
more responsibilities of Oliver yeah is
that usually what happens like in a
family like the guy to me mom the dad
takes the first kid and the mom sort of
takes over the second kid and is
responsible for them because you'll be
like you both yeah oh okay oh she can do
both okay that's cool I was hoping for
this breeze through this whole parenting
thing so that's actually good but no
actually by the time the other kid is
here he'll probably be sleeping in a bed
and waking up on his own and knocking on
the door and saying daddy come get me
make me breakfast watch cartoons exactly
you won't be attached to my boob yeah
but hello guys yes me and Ollie are
jumping in the pool but first I have to
kill something check this out
what is that they cute wasp and I'm
definitely gonna have to kill it so yeah
that thing is freaking huge though Oh No
there it is all robos let it free I'm
sorry this one's got to go oh oh you see
the stick okay let's put it on this side
mmm so it's not like a super hot day
it's probably like 90 degrees which is
not terrible but I'm gonna get in the
pool and actually feels kind of cold
Ollie come here I'm gonna see what
Oliver does if he's not in the water
he's not wet and I'm in the water and
see if he wants to get in or if he just
like walks in or if he knows to be
careful I just want to see what he does
oh you got the goggles you and good
doesn't mama know she's making face you
want to get in it's kind of chilly
cars like yeah it is nice walked all the
way over here where I'm experimenting oh
really what I'm sure I'm trying to see
if you get just like walks in or gets in
or wants to get in we've seen it and he
like jumps in he does should we make him
like cannonball she we have a cannonball
contest yeah oh how can I take the golf
club I don't think he gets in I don't
think I think they did just this there's
too much to learn
let's drop liya oh I guess so he's gonna
try and get in after his toy so this
toys there she'll get in see it's really
silly there you go see it that and
that's common like our common that's
usually kids don't just like go to the
water for no reason they're going to go
because someone's in there or toys in
there or something yeah prime example
right there all right you guys it's time
for a cannonball contest you ready yeah
all right you guys it is now Missy's
turn for the cotton ball go ahead come
on
that's kind of weak who do you guys
think won the Cannonball contest contest
let us know in the comments below
it could be ollie aha all right baby
cannonball here we go I am trying to get
stuff done and look what I got to deal
with oh hi
what's up buddy this is a little window
that's on my door he always comes in
practice his face up against the glass
or like hits it with whatever he's
holding what's up buddy
he's so dang cute what what all if you
do that your face is gonna stick oh I
love that kid but anyway yeah I've
actually I hung Karma's portrait I've
made up my mind I'm gonna do this the
chalkboard wall I was kind of debating
if I was going to do it or not look
there he is again there he is again I
don't know where to put my Luke holder I
have a Luke older I will hold my google
Ailey up I don't know where to put it
just got done filming Oliver haul video
so that'll be up actually today because
I did it today so it would be up today
um but look at this I totally made a
complete disaster so I was like showing
everything and then he kept grabbing
stuff and like running off with it and
so this is basically my room now
completely a disaster what are we gonna
do Oh
hi Eddie
oh wow you're gonna get it oh don't drop
it don't drop it
dammit thank you thank you
there we go isn't that cool you guys so
my aunt I actually got this for all a
for his birthday and I forgot to put it
in the hall video so you're not gonna
see that but it's really cool because
she's like the kids always love you to
blow bubbles but I hate blowing bubbles
like you keep dipping it in keep giving
it in your stall sticking it's gross so
this guy all you do is you bend them
back and you just blows a ton of bubbles
and that's so cool
that's so neat what bubbles everywhere
ready woo whoa right you face hmm
that cool you know you have a problem
you guys Missy is saving maybe one like
set that's like hardly any cookie dough
babe good little snack
but look at this you guys we finally
have our thick fluffy gooey gooey
cookies back and turns out I was right
it was the flour no we don't know that I
think it was a sugar
really I don't know well we got the
sugar and the flour that we were using
from Trader Joe's it's like super nice
yeah and it's not the fact that it's
just like organic it's just like it's
much better quality ingredients then you
would find it like a win Co the well I
did hyung you good Ally on the wall
what's up using my tool set and my cool
new drill where's the truth the truth
get a chair and stuff and I'd like to
set up this area just so I could do like
videos here for my channel a lot of
people have been asking where are the
videos on that channel and honestly it's
like between Missy's channel and baby
League it's just too much I feel like if
if we were only doing like the daily and
macey Channel I could probably without a
video every week on my channel which I
would love to do so I feel like I have
so many ideas and stuff and when I pick
up a groove I can really like get
something going so see what happens in
the next couple months or so if if
something like that ends up happening
that would be fun but I hope you guys
