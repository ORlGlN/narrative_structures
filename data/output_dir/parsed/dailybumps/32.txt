- Good morning, hey boys.
How's it going?
- Good
- Good
- If you guys didn't
watch yesterday's vlog,
I started the vlog (ding)
with Finn in my office
and I was talking about
how when Ollie's at school,
Finn is usually super bummed
so he's always hangin'
out with me, but now
Ollie is home today, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I dunno how Finn
is going to handle having
Ollie gone everyday when
he goes to kindergarten.
That'll be so sad, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, I love you.
I love when you guys
hang out in my office.
(laugh) Sorry, go ahead, buddy.
- Um, I'm gonna build a (mumbling).
- Okay.
So, Ollie's buildin'
Legos and Finn is stacking
and ordering the tic-tac-toe blocks.
That's pretty cool.
- Yeah.
- Can you stack them really
tall and make them really high?
Here, stack them on top
of each other like this.
Can you do that?
- Yeah.
-  'Kay, go.
Aw, you're really good
at knockin' them down.
- Yeah (giggle)
(upbeat music)
- They are so cute, you guys.
I love them. (laughing)
Welcome to today's vlog.
We are halfway through the week, you guys.
That's awesome.
Whoa, you built a big ol' brick?
- Yeah.
-  Oh, and you just need one more?
There we go.
So you created, Ollie, a
giant Lego brick out of Legos.
- Yeah.
-  That's pretty cool.
- Alright guys, I am actually out.
I'm gonna get a pedicure with Kelsey.
And I'm getting a little fill.
I'm actually eating bread
right now because I am so
sick.
I've been on a, I've been
on a antibiotic for a
few days now and like whenever
I take it, I just get so
sick.
Like so sick, even if I take
it on a full belly, like
just ate dinner or breakfast
or whatever, I like am
so sick.
The other day I was taking
Ollie to school and I was like
(gag) (gag), like I literally
felt like I was pregnant.
Like I've felt that before
like while driving and it's so
uncomfortable and so like
before I got in the car to come
here, I just need to bring some bread.
Which I hate eating bread,
but like I was like so sick
and I'm startin' to feel
a little bit better but
I'm excited to go have some
little girl time with Kelsey
and hang out.
I am definitely in dire
need of a pedicure, but I am
doing something different
with my nails lately.
If you guys don't know I have
like super duper thin nails.
They're like flaky.
They break.
They're terrible.
They have been since I was a child.
So, I started doing like
acrylics like a few years ago
and they just break so much.
Like and I'm a mom, like I
can't go get my nails fixed
like that often.
The last time I was here this
girl was like, oh you should
just not put the tips on,
you should just do like the
hard acrylic but no tip.
And it worked amazing.
Nothing broke, they just grew out.
My nail's hard so it's not
breaking or flaking but I don't
have to have.
And I even when I was doing
the tip I was like cutting them
so short that like there
was no point to have a tip.
So, anyways I feel so happy
that I was able to figure
that out.
Alright, I'm gonna head in now.
Alright, I am home and my toes are done.
Aren't they pretty? (giggling)
But they are done, and my nails are done.
Yay.
And now guess who's here?
♪ The family. ♪
Cassie actually hasn't met my horse.
- I know, Mr Nacho.
I haven't even got to see him yet.
(laughing)
So I'm excited.
- She actually hasn't probably
rode in ever, have you?
- No, like and like ten years probably.
-  Ten years, when's
the last time you rode a horse?
- When you took me at Bryan's mom's house.
- Oh yeah, that was a long time ago.
-  That was when I had brown hair.
- Phew.
- That was a long time ago.
- Yeah, I think we do
have pictures of that.
But anyways, yeah so I'm
gonna take her and give her
a little ride and probably like
show her the ropes a little.
She prolly doesn't remember much.
Ollie, do you wanna go see Nacho?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Is that his name?
Do I just have to like
come to terms with it?
Is that his name?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. (laughing)
I keep saying I'm gonna
change it, but I don't think
it's gonna happen guys.
Like I really want to, but
I think I just announced it
so everyone just calls
him it and it's just,
I can't change his name.
- The sun is starting to set
so the boys are kinda savoring
the last couple of minutes of
daylight and playing outside.
And it's beautiful out here, you guys.
It feels so good.
It's like a really nice cool day.
You guys got Rex out here?
- Yeah.
- That's so cool.
- Hi.
-  Hi, are you guys
having fun playing together?
- Yeah, I'm really
really like my surprise.
-  I know, I know,
it's not just yours though.
It's Finn's too.
Okay?
- Okay.
- The kids seriously love this.
Do you guys remember the vlog?
I'll have it in the icard if
you missed it, but this is
like one of their favorite
presents. (giggle)
They play on it all the time.
- Um, um, um, um.
- What?
Okay.
- I got daddy, da.
-  Oh really?
- If you get all the way up and down.
- Nice dude, you wanna slide?
Finn has the funniest reactions on slides.
Go, go, go!
Whoa. (laughing)
That was awesome dude.
You went head first.
- Yeah.
-  I can't believe you did that.
That was amazing.
High five.
(clap) Yeah.
You wanna do it, Ollie?
Oh backwards and head first?
(yelling) (giggling)
- That cool?
-  That was so cool. (giggling)
- Go.
- Wow! (laughing)
- I want daddy.
- These kids are so funny. (sigh)
I love when you guys use your imagination.
You guys are awesome.
(upbeat music)
-  Alright, Auntie's
givin' Nacho a try.
What'dya think?
- He's scared.
-  He's scared?
- That's okay though, he's a good horse.
-  He's really good.
- Let's go.
He's like wait, that
man's takin' my picture.
(giggling) Gotta get my good side.
- So I forgot my camera at
the house, so I'm super bummed
but I've got my sister
out here riding him.
I really trust him.
He's a really, really awesome
horse, but I will say that
he actually is more of
an english saddled horse.
So, I'm trying to get him used to western.
So far he doesn't mind the western saddle.
He definitely I don't think
likes the whole western
style bridle.
He's used to an english bridle.
So, I'm gonna switch up
somethings and then probably get
a trainer to train him
a little more western.
Which I don't think he'll
have a problem with and he's
super awesome and good, but
I do, I can tell that he
doesn't love that bit.
Cassie's doin' good.
- Woo.
-  Whattaya think?
- I like him.
-  Is he good?
He's being good for you?
- Yeah, he's doin' really good.
(soothing music)
-  Oh, hello wife.
- Hey.
-  How's the horse doin'?
- Good.
- Missy has done to see Nacho
I think every single day
since she got him so far.
- Yeah.
- Sometimes two or three times a day.
- Kinda obsessive.
- She's obsessed with
her horse, you guys.
- But I love it.
Actually, I'm definitely
have to get him into some
training though.
Today he was a little more
defiant, I guess you could say.
- Well, probably 'cause
you're workin' him every day.
-  No.
- He went from like not
riding at all, to being--
- I think it's 'cause
he's like wait a second,
I don't have english on.
I can do whatever I want.
She don't know what she's doin'.
I'm just gonna flip my head up.
-  Oh, is that it?
- Yeah, I have to get
him a different bridle.
At least add a little extra
components to it so that
I can let him know that ya can't do that.
-  Yeah. (giggle)
- So yeah.
- And he's gonna need a
little bit of training.
- Yeah
- Which is okay.
- It's not even necessarily
training because, because he's
not a good horse.
It's just training 'cause
I'm changing his style.
- Yeah.
- A little bit, so.
'Cause ya I know a lotta
people been confused at
why like I'm holdin' the
reins like this with two hands
instead of one hand, but
he's an english rider, like
that's just how he is so
- Yeah.
- It's not a big deal.
(laughing)
but, I am getting so strong.
Like my trot, I feel good.
Like, I did like three loops
- That's awesome.
- And I was like I feel great.
Like I wasn't like ow, I was
like yeah, it's only been
one week
- Gettin' used to it?
- and I'm like stronger.
- That's awesome.
- It's so cool.
(giggle) (upbeat music)
- Oh, up.
- Is that cool?
- That is very cool.
Wow, Luna (laughing).
-  She's jumpin' all over you, huh?
- Yeah.
- And go.
- Go.
(laughing)
- It is such a nice night.
I actually went riding
around too and I was like why
am I wearing this long sleeve.
I'm roasting, but as soon
as I was leaving the barn
it got so chilly.
I mean it's not cold or
anything, but it feels so good.
How are my chickens doin'?
They're like it's bedtime.
Sun's goin' down.
Hi Susan, Hi Kelly, Hi
Ursulo 'cause you're a boy.
Hi Brie, Hi Pam, Hi Moana. (giggle)
And one more down here.
I think it's Angela.
I always forget.
Angela and Meredith look very similar.
Let's grab these eggs.
Oh, look at that.
Four good eggs.
Oops.
Where's my apron?
I left it in the house.
Hey, Ollie?
- What?
-  Didn't I give
you an egg just now?
- Yeah.
-  Where is it?
- It's in my pocket.
-  It's in your pocket? (giggling)
Show me.
- Babe, where's your apron?
Your (talked over)
- I know
You're gonna drop them.
- I know.
I need to get a little hook out here.
'Cause I'm holdin' them like this.
I'm gonna drop them.
- You got a egg too?
- I always do.
-  Here, I'll take this one, 'kay?
No, I'll take it.
I got it. (giggling)
Look at these little eggs.
-  Yeah, they're really
fun to cook with, right?
-  Here, I--
- We made french toast the
other morning and I had to
literally do eight of those
because they're so tiny.
- 'kay, careful.
- I want eyes.
(giggling)
- Oh, do you see their eyes.
Oh, he's got egg eyes.
Look at those egg eyes.
(silly talking)
- Okay.
- What?
Alright, dinner is done
and oh, they have cookies
and Luna was like I get cookies,
those are mine. (giggling)
We gotta get ready for bed, huh boys?
Yeah, but, before bed,
tomorrow is actually school.
What is the letter that you're
learning this week, bud?
- Um, P.
- The letter P.
- And starts with it's a papa.
- And papa starts with P, huh?
- Uh huh.
- So anyways, tomorrow is share day.
The letter is P.
So we have to find something
in the house that starts
with P.
- Um hum.
- What does, what starts
with P in the house boys?
- Papa,
- How 'bout?
- Papa, papa's actually not here.
Um, oh, paws.
You could share Luna's paw.
Would that be a good idea?
- But, but--
-  Should we just
take Luna's paw with us?
- No
- (giggle) I'm just kidding.
Let's go look in your playroom
and see what we got, 'kay?
(pop) (kid silly noises)
(soothing music)
- Mickey doesn't start with a P.
-  Nope.
- P, p, p, Batman doesn't start with a P.
-  Nope.
- Sword doesn't start with a P.
- Nope. (giggle)
So we are having a little
trouble finding something
in this very messy playroom
that starts with a P.
I just don't see anything huh?
That snowman and snakes and
dinosaurs and a fireman,
firetruck, camera, buzz,
like there's nothing that
starts with a P dude.
Ollie, I've got a really good idea though.
- What?
- Come with me.
- 'Kay.
- Come out of the very messy playroom.
Oh, can we share your playroom?
- No.
- Say you invite everyone
over for share day to
your playroom.
- Yeah.
- Just kidding.
'Kay, I've got a really good idea.
Come here, come here, come here.
You know what starts with a P?
- What?
- Pictures.
- Pictures.
- P P Pictures.
- Yeah.
- What if we shared a picture
that had papa in it?
- Yeah.
-  You can share a
whole, a picture of your whole
family and it will have daddy
and you and your brother
and me and uncle and
auntie and mimi and papa.
- Papa.
-  Should we do that?
- And Leo.
- And Leo, yep,
Leo's in there.
In the cold.
Alright, you're gonna share

everyone will enjoy seein' the
picture of your family?
- Yeah.
