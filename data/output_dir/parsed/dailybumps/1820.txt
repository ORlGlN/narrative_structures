okay Missy so should we tell them where
we're going now no no okay we're gonna
tell you guys what we're going to
Disneyland
good morning guys so you guys are
probably freaking out wondering what's
going on this morning frankly so are we
because this is very last-minute trying
to think of a way that I can drag this
out as long as possible just kidding
maybe Missy should tell you guys I'm not
gonna tell him what why oh okay
so we're just getting ready to go very
early this how I'm dressed
this is what Missy's wearing this is
what I'm wearing yeah I don't know if
that's important
okay Amy see so should we tell them
where we're going now
no no no okay we're gonna tell you guys
what we're going to Disneyland gonna
ride all the rides in it right oh yeah
right all the rides and I'm that's sick
and I'm gonna go upside down we're not
going to dizzy that shuttle captain
thinkin it's like this they're probably
freaking out it's like dizziness at this
point people have probably skipped
forward because we're going to they
probably have already guessed it let me
know if you actually guessed day before
I keep it ringing pretty good really I
think they are I'm giving it away so I
feel like I have to explain why I'm in
the backseat as usual and again it is
because these two get sick that's my mom
over here and that's Brian and they get
sick like super easily so they have to
be in the front always I don't get sick
unless well just from like obvious
pregnancy sickness but so that's why I'm
in the back that's just I just go back
here it's not a big deal whatever
alright guys so we are at co2 drum plays
campus and yeah so I kind of freaked out
and I decided I need to find out what
the gender is right now so I'm finding
out right now today that's what's going
on that's what we're doing right now
p.m. that's so cool
oh my gosh look at all those snaps
that's like snap hell right there well
it's just two different sizes oh it's
just I can like fold it up so low yeah
looks funny oh my god yeah yeah we do
when she's ready not gonna go take a
break did you guys watch the printed
pictures of the cdcd senator in 55 beats
per minute which is perfect unique
booties all the way at the top of your
ears
that's a shape move it
oh yeah we already know
now we don't down babies being a little
bit stubborn cuz i think cuz the butt is
up you know I can't believe we're here
we're supposed to be here like a week
ago or a week later having a baby
remember your CD pretty guys I love you
listen no it's not a bird so that was a
little bit shocking I'm definitely
surprised that's all I'm gonna say the
plan is is I'm out I know the gender but
you guys don't huh but I want to do like
a big surprise with my aunt and uncle's
and cousins and all that and we can't
have this party this gender-reveal party
until next week because Brian works all
day today and all day tomorrow so that
means that I have to wait one week a one
whole week before I can tell you guys
because we have to have the party first
then we'll announce it in a
gender-reveal video on the bumps along
the way channel it's gonna be hard for
us to keep you secret Brian is really
bad at keeping secrets so I don't know
how long it lasts but hopefully one week
is all you hast away but it's okay
because I can tell them that it's up
because I can just whip it up oh sorry
so should we buy this or this or this or
this
what do you think or should we buy
clothes over here this is cute oh my
gosh what about this should we buy this
would that look good on our baby I think
it depends on the gender maybe this is
this like this or this or this or this I
mean I guess you could put a boy in that
too but you would definitely be in glee
club oh my gosh look at it a little girl
would look so cute in that guy's a
little boy I would totally like cute
Matt okay it's cool Mears I'm going to a
baby shower so I'm trying to find a gift
for her who's having twins
boys twin boys don't get anything she
needs good stuff that's fun Missy look
at all the fake babies on the diaper
boxes seriously I've never seen a baby
that looks like that
but if this was like all no never
happened I mean that one maybe is close
to real men definitely get the shaft
that beams are us look at this mother's
room women's room associates meds we're
behind the associates like come on if it
wasn't for us babies won't even be here
so I just woke up from the most amazing
that Africa so I got up way too early
but I wanted to show you guys this shirt
we got at the general place after we
found out what the sex was it says my
big brother has four legs because no
matter if the baby is a girl or a boy
it's big brother will always be karma
Hong karma huh boy because he's always
like our first baby Missy always calls
him my baby and yes he's like our first
baby and he'll be a good big brother to
a little baby boy or a little baby girl
I thought that was just so cool Missy
saw that and she's like oh my gosh I
need to get this so my dad unfortunately
didn't make it to the ultrasound which
I'm really upset about but we had
decided to show him what the baby is to
see just because I dropped it and now
it's all sideways
oh okay oh my god move your dog's
my dick ulis why is this thing sideways
it's mass what do you think after seeing
this fuzzy little mass in there think
girl or boyfriend those pictures fuzzy
mass gosh dad if another it looks like
you have a ghost in your stomach
looks like Casper the Friendly Ghost
that is no yeah it's a weekend you sure
I know maybe not positive oh my god
I can't believe my family not very good
with the newbies like surprises when
really surprise like I'm psyched we all
get very good but I'm good at surprises
it looks like there's gonna be rain some
fun done east of San Diego but up here
it's gonna be better that's what it
looks like
alright guys so we are getting ready for
bed actually she was like are you
sleeping but we wanted to let you guys
know I know that we kind of may be
teased do you guys a little bit about
the gender but here's the thing we can't
tell you guys what the what they told us
what the gender was today because our
own family doesn't even know and we
can't even tell our family until next
weekend so you guys will find out the
same day as our family but we kind of
have to keep it a secret until then also
the place that we went to this morning
it just it was very odd I guess the way
that they gave us the answer of what the
gender was and we've shown the pictures
to someone who is in the same field and
they actually agree that we definitely
need to rescan because the evidence to
what they told us the baby was is it
really there so we're also not 100% sure
ourselves what the baby is so we're
probably going to be getting a second
opinion maybe even a third opinion this
week before we can actually tell our
family with 100% assurance on Saturday
so next weekend so that's kind of why
we're sort of keeping this on the
down-low and not really revealing what
things are saying we don't want to get
our hopes up for something that isn't
true and we definitely don't want to
and out we're having something this week
and then the next week have it be
completely different we just want to be
100% sure and that and we don't want to
like lead you guys on and make you think
we're having something that we're not
and it would just be a whole mess so
we're kind of just holding off for a
week just to figure out and just to be a
hundred percent sure so that's what's
going on this week it's going to be
crazy but it's also going to be really
really cool I cannot wait to be 100%
sure what we're having we are headed to
bed but thank you guys for watching and
we will see you tomorrow bye oh I just
picked up it's a real step Jesus
he doesn't want saving I got afraid to
throw the ball he's son√≠s
