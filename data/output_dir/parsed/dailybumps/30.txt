- We got a mini Firefly right here, dude.
(laughter)
(sports announcer in background)
You met Firefly, dude.

♪ Let's live it ♪
♪ Live it forever ♪
-  Good morning.
- Good morning, buddy.
What are we doin' today, Ollie?
- We're going to the basketball player!
I mean the basketball game.
- So we were actually invited
to a Harlem Globetrotters game,
and I am so excited because
I have never been to one.
Ollie, you've never been
to one either, have you?
I don't think Ollie's ever been
to a basketball game
and I just feel like Globetrotters are one
of those things were a
boy needs to take his son.
So you and I are gonna go see
the Harlem Globetrotters today, okay?
- Yeah!
-  And guess what?
- What?
- We get to meet the team.
- Team?
-  Yeah, do you
think maybe you could
help 'em do some trick shots?
- Yeah.
- Maybe.
So Missy is running
errands with Finley today.
He's a little bit too young to bring,
so I'm bringing Ollie
and I'm actually bringing
a couple of my buddies and
they're bringing their sons too,
so you're gonna have some friends to play
with too while you're there, okay?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.
- Let's do this.
- Let's do dis.
All right you guys, we are on our way.
I got my buddy Dallas.
- Hello.
- We got Sean and Jude and Ollie.
Are you guys having fun?
- Yeah.
- What are you guys watchin'?
- Lion King.
- Lion King, nothin' like a
little emotional Disney movie
on the ride over, right?
We're almost there, guys.
Are you excited?
- Yeah.
- All right, we got Daniel
and Nico here as well.
You ready to see some trick shots, dude?
- Yep.
-  Yep, these boys
are gonna have some fun.
Ollie's a little bit younger than you guys
but you guys'll also have fun, right?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Hey Dallas, how many times have
you seen the Globetrotters?
- In my life, this'll probably
be like the sixth time.
- That's awesome.
- But I haven't seen them
in probably like 17 years.
- Okay, so it's been a while.
- It's been a while.
- So they're all gonna be 17 years older?
- Yeah, it's the same guys, easily.
It's gotta be.
A lot of knee braces.
- (laughing) A lot of knee braces.
What about you guys, have you seen 'em?
- No.
-  You've never seen 'em?
- Never.
-  You've never seen 'em?
- Never.
- I think we're in for a treat, you guys.
It's gonna be dope.
What you got there, dude?
- Tickets!
-  You got your ticket to the game?
- Yeah.
-  All right, hang onto it, okay?
Whoa dude, look at that!
That is so cool, huh?
-  Yeah.
- We just made it to the arena.
We gotta go down and get
you a basketball, huh?
Does that sound cool?
You guys, I am so excited
there's an actual player
from the Harlem Globetrotters
right in front of us,
number three, Firefly in the house.
What's up, dude?
- Good.
- You wanna show me
your basketball skills?
Show me!
Ollie had to get Firefly
because it has to do
with fire, right?
- Yeah.
- And then he got himself
an actual game ball.
So excited, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
Oh my gosh, Dallas,
that's the wrong jersey!
And he does not care.
Okay you guys, Dallas
is making me look bad,
making us look bad, so I had
to get a Harlem Globetrotters.
He's the only one rollin'
in the green right now.
Take it easy, bro, take it easy.
(upbeat music)
Globey is gettin' it, you guys.
- Crazy mascot Globey
of the Harlem Globetrotters!
(Bryan cheering)
- Is that me?
- No.
Ollie thinks they're cheering for him.
The lights went out, watch.
You're supposed to boo, Ollie, boo 'em.
-  And now,
ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, it's
time to meet and greet
the greatest basketball team on Earth,
the world-famous, the original
Harlem Globetrotters!
- Harlem Globetrotters, let's go!
(cheering)
There they are, dude.
That's the Harlem Globetrotters, Ollie.
Yeah.
Good luck, guys, not that you need it.
This is crazy, bro.
We're literally sitting on the court
with the world's most
amazing basketball team.
It's crazy.
Big Easy!
- Go Globetrotters!
(upbeat music)
-  The Generals are warming up
right in front of us
and Dallas is the only
one cheering them on.
- Is that Firefly?
-  We got a
mini-Firefly right here, dude!
You met Firefly, dude!
That's whose jersey he's wearing.
That's so fun, check this out you guys,
we got Too Tall,
who's actually, ironically, pretty short.
Yeah, say yeah!
- Yeah!
- All right, let's see,
let's see him jump.
(Bryan laughs)
(upbeat music)
Apparently at the Harlem Globetrotters
they have a four-point shot,
did you know that?
These guys are shooting four-pointers.
That's how good they are.
-  On courtside seats--
- Ollie really needed
a cotton candy break.
So for those of you who don't know,
Harlem Globetrotters is
more of a comedy game
than an actual basketball game,
but I think it's safe
to say it's a good one
to take Ollie to for the first time.
Are you havin' fun?
Those guys are funny, huh?
That guy's sitting over in
that lady's lap right now.
(upbeat music)
I am so confused.
The game clock is literally running
and they're running a bit
in the middle of the court.
This is the greatest
thing we've ever been to.
A lady lost her purse in
the middle of the court
and she had to come out and get it
and now they're harassing her husband.
Did you eat all that?
Firefly is probably one of
the coolest players ever.
All right Ollie, they got 25 seconds
to try to take the ball from Firefly.
Even on his knees, oh!
(Bryan laughing)
They're trying to get it,
they're trying to get it, guys,
look, trying to get it, oh!
Oh, she got it!
That is awesome.
- Go Globetrotters!
- Yeah, it is now third quarter,
which means that the Harlem
Globetrotters are now
on our side of the court,
so we're literally gonna
be right in the middle
of all the action, okay?
As he's stuffing his
face with cotton candy.
Ollie's enjoying himself.
- My cotton candy now.
-  Oh, sit down.
- That was cool.
- Come on, man.
Clutch isn't on his A-game today.
I just learned I need
to teach Ollie the YMCA.
I need that to happen.
(dreamy electronic music)
I don't know if that's
where you're supposed to be.
-  How did he even get up there?
-  Now he's dancin' up there!
Did he climb?
- I don't know.
-  Apparently this
is how Harlem Globetrotters
do an instant replay.
They just redo it in slow motion (laughs).
Nico's up!
- Where'd Nico go?
- Torch just took him onto the court.
- Really?
- Yeah, I think he's gonna do something.
You wanna see?
-  Yeah.
-  Dude, he looks so
little up there with everyone.
-  It's time for the (mumbles)
official, authentic,
autographed Big Easy jersey.
(cheering)
-  Can he do it?
- He can do it.
He practices everyday.
-  He practices everyday.
He's been training for this, dude.
- Go Nico!
-  You got this,
dude, you got this!
Here we go.
(cheering)
- Yay Nico!
- Good job, dude!
(cheering)
We got one minute left
and the game is tied.
(exciting music)
They won!
Yeah!
Nice, dude, he signed it.
He signed it.
That was seriously so much fun.
- Yeah.
- You got an autograph,
wasn't that cool, dude?
- And me!
- And you, look at you, dude!
You got them all!
That was awesome, give me five, bro.
That was pretty impressive.
Huge thanks to Harlem Globetrotters
for inviting us out.
We had so much fun, right?
- Yeah, and please hit that subscribe.
- Hit that subscribe and

Wanna see something cool, Ollie?
- Yeah.
- Ready?
Oh, oh!
Ready?
One, two, three, go!
Aww, I'm not very good.
You're much better.
(Bryan laughing)
That was close, Ollie.
Did you have so much fun, dude?
- Yeah.
- He's so excited.
That's what they do out on the court, huh?
- I have wings because I'm Firefly.
-  That's right.
We are now home and Ollie, did
you show your ball to Finn?
- Yeah.
-  Show him your signed ball, dude.
-  Look at my ball, Finn.
-  Isn't that cool?
(screams)
- It's just a ball.
(screams)
-  He's funny.
Hey, babe.
- Hey.
- Oh yeah babe, so Ollie learned some
new basketball moves.
-  Oh, really?
-  And he's gonna
show some to you right now.
All right, show me your basketball moves.
- Ooh, that was actually cool.
- Oh, but it between your legs.
Whoa, pro!
Harlem Globetrotters material
in the future, maybe?
Sorry you couldn't come today, Finn.
Maybe next time, though, okay?
- Hey, how's my basketball moves?
-  Okay, let's see
your basketball moves.
Oh, whoa, can you put
it between your legs?
- Yeah.
- Do it.
Hey Ollie, next time we should go
and we should take Finn, huh?
- Yeah.
- Do you think he'd like it?
- Yeah.
- I think so.
That is all for today's video.
I hope you guys enjoyed it.
If you did, be sure to
give it a big thumbs up.
Finn, thumbs up!
(babbling)
Thumbs up, subscribe,
and we will see you mañana.
I have a Harlem Globetrotter on my back,
that's what happens.
- Bye, boop.
