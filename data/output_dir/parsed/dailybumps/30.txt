- How'd you sleep baby?
- Good.
- Good.
I'm so glad.
So, we have had a good morning.
At least this guy has.
Ollie on the other hand has had
kind of a bad morning.
I feel so bad for him.
He woke up with a fever.
And now his fever is gone
but he's just really like
tired and sluggish so
he crawled into my bed and
he's just asleep right now.
And I'm just so sad for him.
It's especially sad because
we actually have friends
coming into town and he is so excited.
But he's just sick right now
and I'm hoping it's not like something
too terrible.
I'm hoping it's just
like a quick little fever
virus type of thing.
He has no other symptoms
obviously other than a fever
and like just seems a little sluggish
and doesn't seem to feel
totally like himself.
But no cough, no running nose,
no sniffles, yet.
I can kind of feel like
the sniffles are starting to come though.
He like, started doing a little sniff
earlier and I was like oh
please don't turn into like,
I mean a cold is not the worst
but I would hate if he had the flu.
Definitely, definitely a bummer.
He's still like,
but are our friends still coming?
I'm like, they're still coming.
So hopefully it doesn't
get too much worse.
But we are washing sheets right now.
We stripped his bed,
we're washing all of that.
And I'm going through all
his socks and underwear.
He is actually no longer in
the original size of underwear
from when we potty trained him,
he's now another size up.
So, I had to
throw away, well not throw away,
but I had to set aside all of his
first underwear that he ever had.
But Finn was so excited
'cause he got them.
Do you know where we put your undies?
- No.
- Where did we put them?
Show me.
He's not quite yet ready.
We practice like all the
potty training stuff but
haven't gotten to a good point yet.
But anyways,
put all their new
socks and undies up
and away.
And Finn is just being
kind of a crazy boy.
He's like where is my brother?
I have no one to play with.
How ya doing buddy?
Good?
How do you feel?
- Good.
- Good?
You just seem kind of tired.
Can I take your temperature?
Okay.
(soft music)
101.
Oh, you still got a fever baby.
I'm sorry.
I'll give you some more medicine, 'kay?
I guess he fell asleep.
He's not sick at all either.
I feel like I'm living
this weird life right now.
Ollie never acts like this
and he is just definitely,
definitely not feeling very good
and obviously he's got a fever.
Hoping it doesn't get any higher than that
and I'm hoping I can
control it with medicine.
I don't know I just feel so bad for him
and Finn's just taking a
nap in the playroom so,
pretty crazy.
So, my original plan was I
was planning on heading up
to the horse bright and early this morning
to go on a trail and stuff.
But Ollie had just woke up sick
so I haven't made it out there.
I might go out there in a little bit.
Maybe like when, Bryan's going
grocery shopping right now,
but I did just get a cool horse package.
And I honestly don't know what it is.
I ordered a pad
because I wanted to do a
different pad under his saddle.
But I also ordered a really, really, cool
bareback pad that I've
been waiting forever for
and it said that it was delayed.
So, I don't know, maybe this is it.
That would be so cool.
I don't feel like it is though.
It feels too light
but we'll find out.
Alright, let's see.
Oh, it's a
pad.
Oh my gosh, it's yellow.
I did not want yellow.
Shoot.
It's a new pad
but it was supposed to be sandy color.
That looks bright yellow to me
like the sun.
Well, shoot.
I've been really trying
to find the right pad
that would fit, or that would like,
look like a good color on him.
I don't know.
I might be kind of being silly.
I really like, like a deep red on him
but I haven't really found the right pad
that's deep red.
And so I was like, oh I bet tan,
like a creamy tan, or sandy color,
would look cool.
Look at this color.
This is like
bright yellow.
It's like mustard yellow.
I'm gonna have to look at my order
'cause I am pretty
confident I did not order
mustard yellow.
Well, I am super bummed that
the wrong color pad came in.
I did go ahead and just
print a return label
so I could get the right one.
But look what my dad made me you guys.
I have been searching all
over the internet looking for
something cute to kind of put my,
all my tax stuff for the horse and like,
just like a nice little
like carrier for him.
I found a really cool one
but it was really, really expensive
and I was like I wonder
if my dad can make this.
And so he just showed me the first pieces
that are gonna go into the chest
that he's making and check it out.
Like, it's amazing.
Look at this.
So this is my little
what'd you call this?
- I don't know, it's just--
- It's like, so it's something I can carry
so I can put all my
brushes in and all that
and I can carry it around with me.
And then this one will
sit inside the chest
and it can actually slide
back and forth in there.
And it's so cute, I love it.
I can't believe my dad made this.
I can put everything in it.
I can pick it up and take it out.
And it's so cute.
He literally carved that
little handle for me.
He did this and it looks so pretty
and I'm so excited about it.
It's so fun when you
have something special
that your dad actually made you,
instead of just buying it.
- Alright our surprise birthday guest.
Ollie who's here?
- Carl and Jinger!
- Carl and Jinger!
And all the boys!
Thanks for coming guys!
- We're so excited,
it's gonna be so fun.
- Whoop, whoop.
Birthday weekend.
My birthday weekend
has officially begun.
And Carl and I are actually
gonna get ready and we
are gonna hit the town.
We have a little private show tonight
that we're going to in Hollywood.
- I'm gonna wear my Yeezy's.
-  What, you got Yeezy's?
Let me see.
- Look at these.
-  Oh, oh dude!
Yes, those ones.
Those are so sick.
- I gotta bust them out
for the concert, right?
-  Dude, totally.
Totally.
- So awesome.
- So be sure you're
following us on Instagram
'cause I'm gonna be Instagram
storying a ton tonight.
Really fun private show
and we're so stoked
that Carl and Jinger are here
to hang for my birthday.
- Come to my room.
- Yeah, oh you gotta show him your room.
So what's really cool about
having the boys here this time
is that we have plenty
of room in their bedroom
for them to sleep and hang out.
What do you think, is it cool?
- That is so cool.
-  Are you guys
gonna have fun in here?
- Look at that!
-  What, what's up there?
- And we'll put an extra bed in here guys.
So you can--
- That's really cool.
- Plenty room to sleep.
-  Yeah.
So we got a bed down here,
we got a bed up here,
we've got sleeping bags,
we've got a tent.
Who wants to sleep in the tent?
- I do.
- Me.
-  Okay, one of you
guys can sleep in the tent.
You gotta give Luna hugs.
That's what happens.
- Alright guys,
so Carl and Jinger are in town.
And if you don't know,
Jinger is
horse lady.
She knows everything about horses.
So I've been dying
to get her out here to
hang out with Nacho.
Plus, she's Western which I'm
kind of around a lot of English riders
and so I'm really
just looking forward to
her kind of helping me
bridle him,
and just saddle him, and ride him.
'Cause then she can tell me
all the things we need to work on
and I'm just really
excited for her to be here.
So yeah, we're just getting his bridle on.
- By the way,
I have a crush on Nacho.
I love him so much.
- I know.
- He's such a sweet horse.
- He's so sweet.
- I just feel like
he just wants to be nice.
You know what I mean?
- Yup, yup.
Well, we're trying out this new bit.
It's a little bit different.
We're not sure how he's gonna
do with it but
I guess we'll find out.
- We'll ride him and see.
We're at the rodeo.
(laughs)
-  Don't buck us off.
He would never buck.
- No way.
-  You would never do that.
- There's not many horses
that have actually bucked me off.
So, if he bucks me off
that would be very alarming.
- I would be pretty alarmed too.
Yeah, I've only been bucked off once
and it didn't,
definitely got me a little nervous but.
- Nah, if you look at him, he's so chill.
-  I know, he's just like, okay.
(laughs)
- Kay see ya, sit.
-  Yeah.
He rolls over, you know.
- Roll over.
-  Alright, Jinger's giving him
a little try right now.
And I think she definitely
sees some things that
need to be worked on with him
but he's just mainly getting
used to the Western style
versus English style.
Alright Jinger, what do you think?
- I fricking love him.
I think he's a great horse.
I just think that he's really
like pressing all the buttons.
That's what I think.
I think he's still getting used to you.
-  The Western.
- He doesn't like this bit.
-  Yeah, he doesn't like any bit.
I haven't found it yet.
- But I think you made
a really good choice.
Personally, for your first horse,
like he's really good.
I think he's gonna end up
being a really good horse.
- Oh yeah.
- You just have to get
used to each other and stuff.
- Yeah.
- Totally.
-  He's just like, kind of,
doesn't understand the
whole Western stuff.
- Yeah, it's a little different,
like the way you hold your reigns,
the way the saddle feels.
- Yeah.
- The way you ride him.
- The way you ride, yeah.
I legit think he's like
why aren't you standing up?
Like, why do I have to
have all that weight.
- Take some of the weight, will ya?
-  I think that's
what he's thinking.
(laughs)
Like I don't wanna work that hard.
Plus, he's super out of shape so.
- Yeah, but I think he's gonna be fine.
- Yeah.
- Once you get the right
equipment, a little bit like,
you'll get used to him,
you guys are gonna be fine.
- Yeah.
He's a good horse.
Alright, go ride a little bit more
and then I'll get on you.
It's getting so cloudy
and so cold.
It's freezing out here.
I'm wearing like a really light sweater
and like, I'm so cold.
I think it's supposed to rain tonight so,
fun.
There she goes.
-  We just have to appreciate
how pretty Missy looks though.
(laughs)
- Alright, I'm up.
-  'Kay, let's
show us all your skills.
Well, you get 10 points for looking cute.
That's all I have to say.
- Thanks.
(country music)
(laughs)
-  Ollie what is happening?
Are you having a sleepover?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, check it out guys.
We've got
a big 'ol bed here, a bed here,
someone in here.
- Hi.
(laughs)
Tonight, five boys will all
be sleeping in this room.
- Good thing it's a giant room.
- Yeah.
- With so many beds.
- Yeah, yeah there's plenty of room.
Each kid gets their own bed really.
I mean I think Gage is gonna sleep there.
Luke will sleep there.
Kyle's gonna sleep there.
Ollie and Finn are gonna share.
How are you feeling Ollie?
- Good.
- Good, you feeling a
little better right now?
- Yeah.
- Good.
But yeah, we had so much fun
up at the horse today.
Just so, so cool
to be able to hang out with someone
who knows horses so well
and--
- And he's a good horse.
- Yeah.
- So that made
a huge plus.
- Yeah.
- Because he's actually,
I think he's gonna turn
out to be perfect for you.
- Yeah, I'm excited.
I think he's gonna be in
the family for a long time.
Even if I end up getting
another one later on.
But anyways, it's gonna be
an awesome weekend, I know.
The husbands, dads, are gone tonight
'cause they're out at
a fun little concert.
But tomorrow it's Bryan's birthday
so make sure you leave us a comment.
Happy Birthday, Bryan!
- Happy Birthday Bryan!
- And make sure you give this video
a thumbs up if you like Bryan
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.
