chicken wings and go hang out with
friends and family right when it is
ollie make it mash we just got our first
Valentine in the mail I know it's
Valentine's - it's got a little hard on
it and it's got a Mickey Mouse and this
is the Valentine thing that I signed all
a up for it's literally just a bunch of
people in the local area so I know a lot
of people were wondering about it we
just got like a bunch of moms together
and we're like let's all send out cards
or like Valentine cards to the little
kids who don't go to school and it won't
ever get a Valentine so let's see what
you get it says to Ollie and fin from le

sticker in here for you so it actually
wasn't a sticker that was in a Valentine
it was a tattoo even better huh
it's that good better long - two 3 four
4 five 5 six 6 seven 7 eight 8 nine 9 10

I have a feeling that Oliver is going to
be covered in tattoos by the time found
type sacral surprise I think it's a cool
thing to do though for all the local
kids to like feel special and get to
connect in some way you know yeah you
dude
hey buddy hi
as you guys know it is Super Bowl Sunday
and we are actually all headed to a
Super Bowl party in just a little bit
but we're going to like a potluck and so
I decided I'm gonna bring some wings cuz
Super Bowl is all about wings we don't
really care about football do we it's
mostly about the food haha so I pulled
these ones out these are honey barbecue
Missy's gonna taste test them for me
look at that wing it's ginormous
hmm ya like it yep I'm bringing wings
and I am actually making them completely
from scratch yep there's no way that I
just got these in the frozen department
in a bag I made them all from scratch I
made sauces from scratch everything is
from scratch
you
we are at a huge Super Bowl party
there's so many people here so much food
intimidating even Oh football I know
we're like
so they have this thing called Super
Bowl squares I should have listened to
Colin Colin was explaining this to
Jarrod when we were hanging out but um
yeah I'm not exactly I think it's a
score right a score system it's like so
this is the Broncos and Panthers okay
the two teams that are playing oh it's
the Panthers okay that's that's good to
know I'm not sure on this one so does
this mean zero this is confusing so this
is you so I have five squares on here
right there and right there
and then Missy's got a couple also but
other cookies good good do did you have
the wings
I made them homemade they're homemade
they're homemade um do you know how this
works Missy
Jane is he who's mine um don't let Dalek
Daleks it cats and tigers that's inside
where's Cass and horses lions cats vs.
part sticks that's the line I think it's
at the last number
ends with a beat and all cheer each
quarter oh so that's what they do that
winner gets 100 that winner gets a
hundred and then oh the final one
so I want it to end in an eight or -
yeah so you wanted to be like eight
hundred eight or 28 2000 K look who's
