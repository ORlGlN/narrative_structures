iOS 10 it has the new home app and you
can add certain accessories to your
house that you can control through your
phone you guys know me I'm all about

usual so yeah we are gonna be outside

but yeah I feel like today has just been
kind of long and Ollie has an ally and
fin haven't been in the greatest moods
today which I think just happened
sometimes when you have kids um they're
just not always super super happy and I
think exo-m day is always hard because
they get super tired and then if I don't
go home and put them down for a nap and
they end up just getting a little bit
grouchy so they're just having one of
those days
what oh the toy ducks are ducks but the
eggs me look for more honestly all he
has found so many eggs out here I don't
even know how many are left but he has
done a very good job finding eggs but
