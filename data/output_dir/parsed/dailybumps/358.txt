- What's that sound?
-  What is it?
Where did it go?
- How bout that was a T-Rex just roar!
-  Whoa.
- Roar.
(Missy laughs)
(upbeat music)
♫ Wherever you are
♫ That's where I wanna be
♫ All it took was a laugh
♫ In that soft sunset
♫ Big blue eyes looked up and said
♫ This is home
♫ Just runnin' around
♫ You've never looked so cute
♫ Huggin' you tight
♫ Cuddlin' all I could to you
♫ I am home
♫ Home's here right when you're with me
-  Good morning.
- We are at breakfast
which is actually basically lunch
because we slept in, right?
- It was nice.
We needed some sleep.
-  Yes.
If you're wondering why Finn is half-naked
it's because he's eating oatmeal.
- Oatmeal is like the
messiest meal we can give him
but I also really want him to eat.
-  And he does that.
- We're at a restaurant
although it's not a restaurant.
It's like a cafe.
-  Yeah.
- And I took his shirt off
cause I was not about to risk that.
-  Yeah. (laughs)
- Oh my gosh.
It's in your eyeball.
It's in your eyelashes.
(laughs)
And some was on his back.
I was like how?
How does this get on your back?
-  I know, after like
less than five minutes too.
- Hey Ollie, what are
we going to do today?
- We're going to find dinosaurs.
- We're gonna find some dinosaurs.
That's for sure.
We have been at Walt Disney
World for three days now
and this is our third day
and there's on park that
we haven't touched on yet
and that is Animal Kingdom.
So we are heading to Animal Kingdom.
We got a FastPass for a quick safari ride
and then we might check out some dinosaurs
and then call it a day
because we've actually
done Animal Kingdom before
and it was super-fun
but we're pretty worn out
after three days of Disney.
- We're really just tryin' to have a
relaxing slow day,
which is still fun day,
but calm down a little.
-  So we're gonna
go see some dinosaurs
and some animals
and meet up with our friends, okay?
- Yeah.
-  We are waiting
in the lobby of our hotel
which I've just got a chance to look at
and it's like amazing.
- It's Pluto!
-  Oh my gosh, did you
just find that on your own?
- Yeah.
-  That's so cool.
Pluto's hidden in there.
-  Can you find anyone else?
- Yes I can.
-  I bet there's other
characters hidden in here.
Let's see.
- Mickey!
-  No.
What?
-  Oh my gosh.
-  There's Mickey.
Can you find anyone else?
Who's that?
- Um, I don't know.
-  That's Goofy.
- It's Goofy.
(Bryan laughs)
-  Yep and I
think Minnie's over here.
-  Oh yeah, that's Minnie.
-  Minnie.
Is Donald Duck anywhere?
- I find Donald Duck.
-  How does Donald Duck talk?
- Quack quack quack quack.
(Bryan laughs)
- That is Donald Duck
also hidden there.
That's so cool.
I bet there's like a ton
of hidden things like that
in this lobby but check
out this hotel you guys.
This is where we've been staying,
at the Grand Floridian.
A beautiful hotel.
It's been a lot of fun.
We are entering Animal Kingdom now.
Regrouped with all of our friends.
Cal's taking an advantage of the stroller.
(laughs)
He's a happy boy.
This one passed out.
- Finn's asleep.
Taking his nap.
-  Ollie, what do you see?
- I see a fish and a triceratops.
-  Yeah.
- You saw a dinosaur, Ollie?
- Yeah!
- You see the dinosaur?
He see's the dinosaur.
- I see a triceratops.
- He gets so excited
when he sees this triceratops statue.
So we just walked into Animal Kingdom
and I could actually see
where they're building
the new Pandora section based
off the World of Avatar.
It's so cool.
Check it out.
You could get a little
glimpse of it, right here.
That's so cool.
This is my favorite thing
about walking in to Animal Kingdom.
Seeing the Tree of Life.
(upbeat music)
Look at this big old tree, bro.
-  Is that Rafiki's
tree in Lion King?
- Yeah.
Oh yeah.
-  What do you see, Ollie?
- I see otter, inside
pretty bad right there.
-  That's pretty bad?
- Yeah.
-  That's a ram.
- Yeah, it's pretty bad.
-  Look at that ram.
Ollie, what is this?
- It's a crocodile.
-  That's a big one.
- Papa, I push his eyes
-  Oh, you touched his eyeball.
-  There you go papa.
He's touching the crocodile
in the eye, aren't you?
Poke him in the eye.
Poke him, poke him, poke him, poke him.
- Look at his teeth.
-  Wow.
- So he could bite.
(upbeat music)
- Oh my gosh.
Dude, we must got like three million steps
because we just walked
all the way to Africa!
We're gonna go on a safari.
What are you looking forward to seeing?
- I'm ready.
Lions and--
- Tigers.
- A giraffe.
A giraffe.
- Bears.
- Bears.
Is there bears in Africa?
- I don't know.
- Lions.
- Yes, the African Bear.
- Yes, let's go.
- I ain't a lion.
- Ohhh.
(upbeat music)
- We are getting on a safari.
Gonna go see some wild animals.
You ready Ollie?
- Yeah.
- Hey Finn, are you ready for the safari?
Ya ready buddy?
- It smells good, huh?
Yep.
(tribal music)
- Ollie, what are those?
- Birds and hippos.
- Birds and hippos, yep.
That's pretty cool.
Oh, look at those birds.
You cannot have a crocodile, silly.
(laughs)
Those crocodiles can bite
up to two thousand pounds per inch.
That's a strong mouth.
You don't want that to bite you, do you?
- No.
(tribal music)
- Hey Carl, that's a pretty horny cow.
(Carl laughs)
Thanks for laughing, Ginger.
I was just looking out for the monkeys.
- Monkey point.
- She's obsessed with monkeys.
Probably cause she has a monkey climbing
all over her all day.
- I definitely have a monkey right here.
I don't need a monkey any more.
-  Hey look, an elephant.
See the elephant?
- Yep.
-  It's big, huh?
- Yes.
Elephant, ewe.
That stinks, that stinks.
- Does it smell like poo-poo?
- Yeah.
- Apparently the elephants
smell like poo-poo.
- They stink like some poo-poo.
(gentle music)
-  That, Ollie, is
the king of the jungle.
That is so beautiful.
Ollie, who is that?
- Simba's dad?
(tribal music)
- I want the zebra to talk to me.
-  He can't talk to you.
Alright Ollie, next stop Dino land!
That's where we're headed.
- Maybe we could go to Dino land.
We could see a pterodactyl.
-  Where?
- Right there.
-  That is a pterodactyl.
There's lots of dinosaurs.
Look at that brachiosaurus.
- Yeah.
-  That's huge.
- Yeah.
And it's got teeth for bite us.
- Watch out, Gage, it's gonna bite you.
- I know the name of this dinosaur.
- What is it's name?
- Bryan.
(laughs)
- That's an old joke.
Watch out Finn.
You gotta be careful of these ones.
They're meat eaters.
You got lots of meat.
You got lots of meat on there.
(dramatic music)
Oh.
-  Touch it nice an gentle.
-  My gosh.
-  Hand cleaner
when you're all done.
-  Wow.
-  Is that a cool snake?
- Yeah.
(tribal music)
I wanna touch the teeth.
-  You already did, remember?
- No I didn't.
-  Yeah, the
last time you were here
this dinosaur almost ate you.
-  Come up here.
-  Uh oh, who remembers this?
- Ow
-  Ahhh.
Say thanks Carl.
- Thanks Carl.
-  Alright, you're welcome dude.
-  He survived, Finn, he survived.
- He's like we good.
-  Look at, he looks
a little traumatized though.
- He's like, nah, didn't scare me.
-  What Ollie?
- I think I see something!
-  Let's go see it.
Come on!
Whoa!
- I see a squirrel!
-  Okay, he cares
about the squirrel?
Look at this dino head.
- Oh it's a little scary
touching the teeth.
Touch the top teeth.
-  Oh, that is creepy.
(laughs)
- We better get away.
-  We better get away, go, go, go.
- That is a big brachiosaurus.
-  That's a brachiosaurus?
-  Yeah.
-  Whoa, you're right!
- Let's go under it.
-  Okay, we'll go under it.
- He's gonna poop on us.
-  You think

- Ewe, ewe, yuck.
Ahhhh.
(Missy laughs)

Alright, let's go.
Alright so all the big kids have gone

It is actually a ton of fun.

There was a T-Rex down there.
Then it just roared!

(Missy laughs)
Leave me alone T-Rex.
Don't bite me up.
I want you to be a nice T-Rex.
(Missy laughs)
Grrr.
(gentle music)

Yeah?
Woo, it's hot.
- What's that sound?

Wow.
- Mama, look at all these footprints.
-  Whoa, what kinda
dinosaur do you think that is?
- I see a dino print,
a T-Rex one.

- Raptor, yeah, you're calling it.
(dinosaur roars)
What was that sound?
Let's use this shovel.
-  Let's use the shovel.
Oh, it's stuck there.
- I can't get it.
- Oh that fan feels amazing.
That feel good Ollie?
- Yeah.
- It really is not that hot of a day
but it is kinda humid.
And by the way Ollie always
gets a very red face.
He looks like he's got a sunburn
but he doesn't.
He gets like tomato face
when he just gets a little bit warm.
But yeah, the kids are having so much fun.
Aren't you Finn?
I don't think anyone's coming down that,
but it's a little scary.
Come here.
(upbeat music)
- Hey Ollie, I got you
something really cool.
You wanna see?
- What is that?
-  It's a rock and
it's got a dinosaur on it.
What kind of dinosaur is that?
- A T-Rex.
-  Isn't that cool?
- Yeah and I want T-Rex.
-  You got one right there.
Look, let me show you.
It's a little baby T-Rex, huh?
- Well it's not a toy.
-  No, it's just cool.
(upbeat music)
