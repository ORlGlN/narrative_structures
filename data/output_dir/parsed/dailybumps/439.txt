I am
over every
good morning guys today I tested out the
new DJI Mavic Pro that DJI actually sent
me I was stoked when I received it
because I haven't brought the drone out
in a while I have the big DJI and I just
haven't gotten around to pulling it out
and flying it so this was a good excuse
plus we're going somewhere super fun
today where I think we're gonna get some
really good footage with this good
morning Finn hey take your carrot yeah
are you eating your carrots this morning
your fake carrots good morning karma yes
this morning we are packing because we
are going to the cabin
say yay say yay okay he's clearly not
gonna say yay we're head up seven yeah
that was kind of like a game right it up
to the cabin to go see snow we're gonna
introduce a Luna to the snow and
hopefully just get some fun snow
activities and been itching to get on
the slopes and go skiing for a long time
and maybe we didn't throw this kid on
some skis hey maybe not this kid but
maybe Finn or maybe Ollie so I am
packing the boys right now but we're
only going for a few days so I'll have
to pack like a ton of stuff so I was
able to pack both their stuff into one
suitcase and all this is Finn's stuff
he's got his sound machine his monitors
some diapers gotta grab some wipes umm
his blanket and a bunch of clothes and
this is all of all these clothes this is
not a last-minute trip but I didn't do
as much planning in my head of what they
need so I'm like okay is that everything
oh wait I need this I mean this I hate
doing like oh wait I forgot this I need
this cuz normally I do like a lot of
planning ahead of time of what I need
and I'm feeling like oh god what am I
gonna forget I've got all the jackets
here which are really big because we're
going to the mountains that stuff takes
up so much space so I think I might get
like a separate like more like a duffel
bag to stuff like tons of big fluffy
jackets and snow pants are you ready for
the snow are you so excited yeah yeah
who's coming with us
me me haha yeah yep no uncle's not
coming he has school so he can't come

think you look like a ghost because your
son less about it is oh look at she
looks normally guys yeah I'm going in
just a really white anyways but
I guess maybe these glasses do make me
look I'm literally like itching for
summer or I know and we do we doing
sometimes but we're going to enjoy some
snow and maybe we'll enjoy summer in
like a couple months a little basically
we happen
things have gotten a bit stressful for
the last 30 minutes as we started
climbing the mountain we realized we
like literally looked at our gas and it
says we had 20 miles left 30 miles and
we have 30 miles to go and so basically
we just hit the did the 0 v 0 miles left
it says - - so it says - - Meeny we have
0 miles left and we have 13 miles to go
we're like super stressing out I'm like
I hate it oh they're gonna do that
because we can't make it down the
mountain we're too far on the mountain
yeah we can't retire even before
sometimes this happens sometimes and
when we get to the - - we usually can go
a little bit further so we're just
trying to Coast down like the hill parts
and then obviously we have to climb up
Oh
so stressful my parents are behind us so
like they don't know gas tank but at
least we would have someone cuz um the
other bad part is that we have no
service so if you could call this like a
human fail parent fail vacation fails
that's basically everything that's
happening or not well it's so far it's
not a fail until we actually do fail we
might make it but friends like really
really like yeah we're just we're gonna
run we're just gonna go as far as we can
and they're mostly red button there's
gas and tears Oh God my kids are not
gonna make it it's really stressful
right now alright we are point four
miles away from the gas station
Finn is very unhappy we are hosting our
down this little bit point four miles
point eight point four miles we could do
this again maybe nine zero miles for
over ten miles
