morning guys
we actually this morning went to a
doctor's appointment and we didn't get a
chance to vlog it so we thought we'd
give you a little update a lot of you
guys have been asking if we had gotten
the results back for our echocardiogram
and we had it until today we just claim
that it's been like eight weeks now I
just go to our appointment afterwards
for like three weeks out when they
cancelled on us and then today was like
as soon as we can do it so yeah we went
in today to get the results for our
echocardiogram and they came back as
completely clear we have no like dilated
a or tocqueville's there's no issues no
nothing he said on so that doesn't
really say much so it could still be
some sort of genetic issue that we don't
know about and I don't know what we're
talking about basically Ollie and Finn
were both born with a dilated aortic
valve in their heart so we're basically
just trying to get to the root of it now
see if it's something that we do need to
be concerned about they are being tested
for it every six months yes
well always been clear spin is result
but machine and I are completely clear
so guess it's back to the guys it's like
good but it's also like we just that we
don't have any answer still so so let's
figure it all out and yeah so that was
basically our morning and now we're
going to have a fun day with our boys

some exercise so I got the ball tour and
a ball we're going to go play some fetch

egg crate and all these eggs and I think
what we do is we fill all these up with

it's a little bit different than egg
Roulette we won't be getting age on

this is so cool you guys the eggs that
it comes with
I like this soft silicone right so it'll
be filled with something and they're
really easy to crack on your head so

water in it or they'll all fit over you
