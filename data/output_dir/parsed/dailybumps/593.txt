excited it's so cute
wherever you are that's whatever wannabe
since that big
I am
holder ever
me
good morning guys it is a beautiful day
here in sunny Southern California and I
am up and getting ready for the day I
got my hair all done I'm dressed and
last night I only slept in my bed
because I miss he's still in Hawaii and
this morning he brought in one of those
little dinosaurs full of those little
beads and it broke open I don't know if
you can tell but all these little white
beads we're all over the bed all over
the pillow all over my body cuz they
just stick to you and I was like okay I
guess I'm up can't really sleep in when
you got white little things all over you
I think
awliyas facetiming Missy in the playroom
so we're gonna go see what they're up to
right now
you miss mama are you talking to mama
yeah where's she at why she's in Hawaii
but she's gonna be here today I know I
do too babe alright always say bye mom
I'll see you soon love you hurry home
grab it an outfit for Olli cuz I'm gonna
take him the zoo today with Mimi and
Papa and I got this really cool you're
my world shirt it's a size four so I'm
not quite sure if it'll fit him it
seemed like it was okay in the shop but
we'll see when it's on him because he's
actually very small and I don't really
know what size four means because he's 3
so technically he should be in a 3t but
he also fits in smaller clothes I'm 30 I
think he still wears like 2t so if
anything if it doesn't fit you can wear
it probably in a couple months but let's
see if that works
Holly what do you think of your new
shirt oh cool it is pretty cool it's a
little big though huh okay
eighty-one yeah I think we're gonna have
to try a different one for today that
one's a little too big
hey walk over there and then walk back
let me see let me see you okay come back
I don't know what do you guys think it's
definitely too big
I think dang maybe after we wash it
maybe we wrinkle it okay I would do okay
okay he wants to walk back again it's
like a little fashion show okay now come
back so strange you guys this shirt same
size same store fits him way better look
at this little seam right here actually
lines up right with his arm - yeah yeah

Instagram you should be I posted a ton
of awesome cute pictures today and I've
also been adding to my Instagram story
which is basically like instagrams take
on snapchat so this is my Instagram
story it's a lot like snapchat basically
is it's like the same story format but I
post a lot on my Instagram story as well
which i think is actually really fun
rarely found in the wild look at this
the great Holly bares his teeth on
intruders so I've been actually having a
lot of fun with Instagram stories and I
know a lot of people really like
snapchat and I did like snapchat too and
I'll probably still post a little bit to
my snapchat but I think it's just easier
to post to Instagram stories and it's
basically like the same thing and
they're gonna be adding a lot more cool
things to it like cool facial stuff I
bet but you should let me know in the
comments below
