good morning good morning Oh kisses
dolly kisses you cutest baby ever did
you know that okay
he's like full-on making out yourself
now I'm dating that boy he's gonna do
amazing things
good morning guys all I just broke up
from his nap and the saddest thing just
happened I'm so I just that was really
scary so he was um in his bed and I was
watching him on the camera and I was
actually getting ready to come up here
and all of a sudden I hear him start
crying and he was saying mama mama which
he never does it was like the saddest
thing I've ever heard like him cry mama
and I come up here and I find his leg
between these bars right here and he was
crying and I started I was like Brian
come up here I need your help and so
Brian came up and he had to like pick
him up and like twist his leg out and
luckily afterwards he was crying but he
seems fine now I think he was more like
scary because he was stuck and he
couldn't move and it probably hurt a
little bit cuz your leg was stuck in
there huh it was so sad because he was
yelling my name and I was like oh my god
but he's playing in his room right now
and he always likes to grab all the
books out bring them all onto the floor
and scatter them around but don't read
him a book he don't want to be read to
hey guys
raise your hands if you're already
sweating for the day that that'd be me
this Amir is really dirty too what so
I'm not like
oh yeah that's true it's not up there
very well so like just don't clean don't
touch yeah be very careful with that
ready we're going out going out is he
taking his drill he has to have his
drill you just oh all right
there's some pasta drilling morning we
are headed out to have a little bit of
fun and go pet some animals and look at
this car wash
yeah we really need a guardian so bad I
like to get all the little spots
hey that there's still stuff on the top
up here from like that tree that was
dripping oh we don't we went to
Disneyland
it was so crazy luckily I didn't eat
before I left the house so I'm
definitely gonna need some food that's
always a good idea I go right there
really it's like a rock formation in the
ah they're not gonna be able to back
they should have in front to happen
nothing sounded good good
careful foot on your hand and then not
so funny
all right guys we have stopped at the
dairy farm we're just feeding some
animals and macey got this
what is it strawberry it's a strawberry
little ice cream car ice cream I like it
hey weird face yeah it's really cold so
it's got like little bits of strawberry
in it yeah what do you think
mmm you can't test you two hands but
basically the best thing to do at de
Jong series just to feed the animals and
get a big ol thing a chocolate milk and
we put some whole milk in Ali's cup cuz
he's been drinking whole milk more often
too so that's coming right from the cows
right here at the dairy farm so pretty
cool cuz it's nice and fresh I have to
be quiet cuz all he's sleeping right now
one funny thing ever I knew he was tired
and he had to go to sleep we were
actually on our way to go get some food
and it's always nice if he falls asleep
on the way because then we can lay him
in his stroller and like eat in peace
while he sleeps and we can get out of
there faster and he was having the
toughest time so we were at a red light
and Missy and I were literally rocking
back and forth in the car to rock it and
his eyes just slowly closed and it
actually awake today sleeping
corner bakery cafe used to work here but
it was not a cafe it was like really
nice stay camps this is actually where I
waited tables that's weird it's
completely different
yeah they moved they just changed so
much about it but I'm excited we like
little places like this so we're gonna
go see ooh look at all these na Me's it
looks I can't even think of like where
everything was now miss you they like
gutted this place crazy but it's
basically like a Panera almost right you
got a panini John Midori it's a good
cool I got just a simple sandwich with
turkey bacon avocado tomato it's so
weird being in here you guys because
like that over there it used to be a bar
this used to be like the bar area can
you imagine me like where I worked right
here yeah like I'm mr. strawberry
lemonade ever so good oh I know they
don't like a hibiscus lemonade over
there yeah but it's like it's just so
weird it's so different look who woke up
just in time for dessert he's like I'll
take one of those oh you want one of
those cinnamon rolls
look at these little pot cakes made look
good just got back and I made a little
run at Ruth Ann don't know if you guys
know how much I love this place it's a
really fun place to shop for mostly
Oliver just because it can be a little
spongy sometimes but he doesn't really
cost that much he just eats a little bit
of food so it's really nice so I'm going
to show you guys what I got at this
little bag and inside it's got just a
little tiny chicken free-range chicken
and so just a nice little slice to make
for him also got him some cinnamon swirl
raisin bread this probably is for Brian
too it's kind of like that one raisin
bread just like a more organic kind and
it's got a little bit more natural
ingredients in it next we got green
beans as usual love green beans and then
I got Oliver some organic butternut
squash cubes so I can just kind of like
boil these up or heat them up somehow
and you could have just like little
cubes of butternut squash which he loves
grab some of the same type of thing but
in sweet potatoes because he loves sweet
potatoes and next I picked up something
a little treat for him these are organic
mini pancakes and they actually have
blueberries in them so I thought that
would be kind of fun to kind of switch
up some of his breakfast so yeah so just
like a couple things for Oliver and know
