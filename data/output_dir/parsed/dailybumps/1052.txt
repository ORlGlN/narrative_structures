who knew which is going to be out on
Friday also that's basically Thursday
night so if it's up right now and you

it I'll have a link below as soon as
it's live the song is basically about
missing eye growing up together as a
young couple leaving the town that we
grew up in and just everything we sort
of faced until then so it's a really
cool song
I really hope you guys will check it out
so after the song goes up probably as
soon as the lyric video is done I'll
have that up a couple days afterwards
and then we're actually still in the
process of shooting the music video I
have some shooting that I have to do
next week before we leave for Hawaii and
then they're going to be working on a
lot of stuff while I'm gone so hopefully
we can get the music video out like a
week or two later this music video is so
different from anything we've ever done
before I mean I hired a director we are
hiring actors and we're also going to
need extras which means we're going to
need your help so I'm going to have a
link below in the description to a event
page on Facebook and if you guys are in

think maybe you could pass for a high
schooler we need your help we basically
need people to play extras in a school
type setting like a high school type
setting if this is something that you
