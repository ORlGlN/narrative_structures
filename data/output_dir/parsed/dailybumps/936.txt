we slept so long we went to bed early

California yeah that is true that's true
our room is a mess because what can you
expect there are two girls in this room
and we're just making a mess I like gave
up like in Seattle all like I get super
mean and I came here and I'm like I'm
leaving today
yeah we're not even trying today so
everything is kind of scattered
everywhere and we don't care we're ready
to go try some New York bagels we're
going to go have some fun in the tap in
town
hopefully not overdo it because it's
easy to do in New York because
technically when you're in a city like
this like you're supposed to walk and
you know do stuff but I can't be doing
that and yesterday I had to just go two
blocks to our photo shoot and I was like
I think I think I'm gonna call a cat
because I
I don't want to push myself when we're
going to be doing stuff all day long so
I did and the cab driver was like you
know that's walking distance right and I
was like yeah you have eight months
pregnant right geez made me feel bad we
just ate a delicious breakfast because
we had to have breakfast in New York
City I've never had bangles in New York
and I do find that they're quite
delicious so we each ate only half our
bagel but it was good huh it was really
do better than any other fatal right
yeah it was really good yeah we're ready
to start our day now you ready
