new project we're hoping that it's going
to be done by summer and it's going to
be a rough couple of months with what
we're doing but it's gonna be really
exciting to see the progress and we want
to walk you guys through it so that you
can be here for the whole thing and get
to see it from start to finish because I
think that's amazing when you get to see
something before then when you get to
see something after I love that I love
those sort of things especially with
like home improvement shows and stuff
like that but yes I actually have a crew
of people in our back yard today they're

think things are you actually open I
don't have cavities a year ago I had a
bunch of cavities and they filled them
all on here and I feel like my teeth
have never been right and I don't know
if it's because I chose like the white
fillings I don't know
yeah I'm hoping that I don't have any
more cavities because what would so also
I picked up a $25 gift card for Tonya
the lady who cleans my tea because I
accidentally missed my last appointment
and I had to reschedule and I feel
really hot and I actually did miss I
actually did forget sometimes going to
the dentist can be rough and so we
psychologically tell ourselves that
different date I don't think that's what
happened but I got this just in case so
going in to get my teeth cleaned so I
know I just flogged me walking into
Staples but I've left staples I went to
