- Okay, so, doctors who
are currently treating
these three crazy kids.
This is how they hurt themselves.
Climbing down the rock, I'm filming this.
So, that they have record.
Oh, my gosh.
♫ This is our life, this is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream, this is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
- Morning.
- Good morning!
It's morning, Finn is such
a good mood, isn't he?
Yep, he's eating some Teddy Grahams.
It's not exactly morning.
Missy just got back from
the gym with the boys
and I'm still a little
bit under the weather.
I'm feeling better but
I'm just really weak.
So I'm trying to just take it easy.
But I miss these boys so much.
Love you.
- Love you.
- Did you have fun?
- Gah.
- Yeah.
I think Missy's taking the
boys somewhere fun today.
You excited?
Yeah (laughs).
This little one is growing
up so fast, you guys.
He's such a big, independent boy.
Just walking around the house
with a cup of Teddy Grahams.
- Good morning.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Did you have so much
fun with Papa yesterday?
- Yeah.
- I watched, my dad did tons of video.
And I know some of it was in the vlog
but they are so cute.
I was just loving it.
I was like, apparently we
need to get Ollie a snake
'cause he's obsessed
and loves them so much.
Anyways, me and kids just
got back from the gym.
They got to do their little daycare.
Me and Kelsey did a really hard workout.
And whew, I'm gonna feel it tomorrow.
It was bad, it was really, really bad.
But anyways, I wanted to tell you guys,
it is a beautiful, beautiful day.
We have a really fun day planned.
But I just came back here
to play with the dogs,
check on my chickens.
And one of my chickens
just cock-a-doodle-dooed.
For reals, it's a boy (laughs).
That is kind of a bummer.
I love the cock-a-doodle-doo.
I think it's the cutest thing ever.
It doesn't wake me up
and doesn't annoy me.
I think it's like super cute
and kind of fun to be
like, "Oh, I'm on a farm."
But as soon as that rooster
starts trying to attack me,
it's gotta go, it's gotta go.
I had a rooster a few months
ago, some of you don't know.
And unfortunately, it just
started attacking the kids.
It started attacking me.
I mean, we raised it from a baby, baby.
Unfortunately, this one is a rooster.
And I'm really super bummed about it.
Are you guys safe up here from Luna?
- Yeah.
-  She is dirty!
She's been playing in the mud.
She's like, "You're not safe from me."
(laughs)
- We're going off the mountain.
- Yes, that is right, we
are going up the mountain.
- Mint in.
- Mint in.
Mountain, Ollie, say, "mountain."
- Mountain.
- Good job, good job.
But yeah, so, I have
decided to join the family
on this little gathering to the mountains.
I feel like I am getting better.
I'm very weak so I'm
just gonna take it slow.
I have a DayQuil so that helps too.
I know, I feel like I just
need to get out of the house
and clear my head a little.
'Cause I've been cooped up there,
'cause I've been really sick.
Cough drops.
- Cough drops.
- Cough drops.
What's Finn doing, Ollie?
- Sitting, still awake.
-  He's awake?
Is he eating his quesadilla?
- Yeah but no.
- Yeah but no.
The boys are watching
The Nightmare before Christmas right now
on the little TV in the
truck, which is so convenient.
And they love it.
Well, Finn isn't watching it.
He's listening to the
soundtrack, as our we.
- He might be able to see
it through the reflection.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
We need to get him like a
little mirror so he can see it.
But Ollie loves this movie so
it's keep him nice and quiet.
So, yeah, today we are headed
up the mountain to Idlewild to explore
the little mountain town
for Mimi's birthday.
So everyone be sure to
wish Mimi a happy birthday
down below in the comments.
This is where she grew up so
it's always fun to come here.
We always do this a couple times a year.
Hang out up there, enjoy
the fresh mountain air.
And there's always fun thing to do.
(upbeat music)
So, we just got to the lake
where we're doing our
little family picnic.
It's so pretty.
Look at that rock up there.
-  There's fish in the water.
-  Do you see the fishies, Finn?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
-  Fishies!
-  (laughs) Fishies!
-  Say, "Come here, fishies!"
That's so cool, you see
fishies in there, huh?
Uh-oh, we gotta be careful, Ollie.
There's a bear warning here.
- Yeah, that sign says
no bears.
-  No, it says
there could be bears.
So we gotta be careful, okay?
-  Okay.
- Okay, come on (laughs).
We're hoping we don't run into any bears
or werewolves for that matter.
It is October, you never know.
- I'm not sure about this.
-  You're not sure about this?
-  No.
-  Why?
There could be bears.
-  We don't wanna wake them up.
-  No, we don't
want to wake them up.
What did you find?
- Acorn.
-  Oh, it's an acorn.
Good find, buddy.
(lighthearted music)
So, we have nice picnic
set up for all the bees.
- Yeah, we have to walk and eat like this.
(Bryan laughs)
- They're Yellowjackets,
and Yellowjackets love meat.
-  Yeah.
- I gave them a sacrifice.
I gave them meat,
left it on the table, walked away.
(Bryan laughs)
It wasn't enough.
-  They're still
kind of swarming everywhere.
(Bryan laughs)
Finn, what are you eating?
Are those raspberries?
- Yeah.
- Yum.
(upbeat music)
Both the boys are watching
them catch them fish.
(laughs) Just don't
fall in the lake, okay?
(Finn babbles)
Oh, really, what do you see?
(Finn babbles)
Oh, cool.
Do you have room for that one too?
(laughs)
- Oh, my gosh, that's two in his mouth.
Let's see if we can get a third one in.
-  How many peanuts
can we fit in his mouth?
So crazy.
No way, no way, three?
Oh, he's gonna take that one back.
-  Say, "I'm a chubby bunny!"
(Bryan laughs)
-  Winter's coming.
-  Don't make fun of him.
-  It's coming,
gotta get ready for it.
- He's doing the chubby bunny challenge.
(Bryan laughs)
-  Missy is trying
to get over to the rock.
And she can only do it
with the help of her dad.
(Bryan laughs)
- Hang on, Dad, just hang on.
Hang on to me, guys, hang on.
Did it.
-  She's so funny.
-  Did mama get over to the rock?
(Bryan laughs)
- Hi!
- Nice job, babe.
(Ollie grunts)
You can do it, here.
I'll give you a little
boost, grab her hand,
and I'll give you a little boost.
There you go.
- Get on my hands.
(Ollie whines)
-  Don't drop him.
Use your feet, Ollie!
Hold on, Finn!
You can do it!
-  Daddy!
- You can do it, Ollie!
You can do it.
(Finn whines)
(laughs) Hey, Finn wants up there too,
did you guys know (laughs)?
Good job, Ollie.
- Okay, now you, Finn.
-  Finn, do you wanna go up?
Good job, Finn.
- You can't get me.
(Bryan laughs)
(lighthearted music)
- Most of everyone has gotten off the rock
and so now Cassie is
stuck with little kids.
And trying to figure out
how to get down (laughs).
(upbeat music)
Look at you, Ollie.
-  You did it!
-  Yeah!
(Ollie screams)
(Bryan laughs)
That was up pretty high.
Finn's got the biggest smile on his face.
(laughs) Oh, my gosh.
There we go.
Come on, buddy.
Is that cool?
-  Dad, catch
me, I'm gonna jump off.
-  We just found
a swarm of lady bugs.
- They're everywhere.
-  I've never
seen anything like this.
I don't know if you guys
can see them down here.
But there's just lady bugs.
-  One, two, three.
-  They're everywhere.
-  Oh, it went on my shoe!
-  Oh, my goodness,
they're getting on your shoe!
-  Whoa, that's so cool.
They must've just hatched or something.
- Yeah, there's tons.
He's on you.
- Don't squish him.
(Bryan and Missy laugh)
- "Don't squish him."
Okay, I'll throw him (laughs).
We're walking around.
This is a lake they have here.
They've got some really cool
trails and bridges and stuff.
Definitely is a little low though.
'Cause that doesn't have
water but that does.
(gentle music)
Missy is putting in all the experience
she got rock climbing
yesterday at the rock gym.
And climbing an actual
rock in real life now.
- (pants) I'm a professional!
Not yet.
- (laughs) I would probably try
to get up there if I wasn't so sick.
Oh, my gosh.
Cassie, you look really small up there.
You did it, babe!
How's it feel?
- It feels like I'm gonna throw
up, I'm afraid of heights.
-  (laughs) Missy just
discovered her fear of heights.
She's freaking out.
All three of them are up there.
- I think there's a jump.
-  That's the only
way down is into the water?
-  Yeah.
-  Hey, Ollie, I
can't find Mama anywhere.
Do you know where she is?
- Up there!
-  What is she doing up there?
-  I don't know!
-  (laughs)
She's doing what you do.
That weird zen mode thing
he gets in (laughs).
-  How did you get up there, Mama?
- I don't know, I don't know.
-  How you getting down, Mama?
- I don't know, I don't know.
- You can jump from there.
- Okay, I'll just jump.
-  Yeah, she can just
jump from this giant rock.
That is the only way
she'll be able to get down.
(laughs) Okay, have fun, bye!
Say, "Bye, Mama!"
- Bye, Mama!
(Finn whines)
- Finn's not okay with that idea.
-  Okay, so
doctors who are currently
treating these three crazy kids.
This is how they hurt themselves,
climbing down the rock.
I'm filming this so
that they have a record.
(Bryan laughs)
Oh, my gosh.
-  One more right here.
-  Got it.
-  Down further.
- See, I would've never
have gone up here if dad wasn't here.
Like, I don't do that.
-  (laughs) He does have a way
of getting us out of sticky situations.
-  Okay, there's
another one way down here.
(gentle music)
-  He's pulling your foot,
he's pulling your foot (laughs).
- I feel like a cat right now.
No, don't pull me down!
-  She did it, free!
(laughs) That's quite the rock.
What are we doing?
- We're practicing our cartwheels.
I'm gonna show all these
people younger than me
that I can do it!
-  All right, Ollie's
gonna do it real quick.
You do it first, Ollie.
That was close.
Oh, that was close too.
Both were very valiant efforts.
Okay, all right.
- Okay, Jimmy.
-  You got this, Jimmy.
Let's see.
Okay.
- I mean, it was a round off.
Round off again.
-  To beat a bet right here.
-  Finn's still trying
in the background (laughs).
Ready.
- I can't do it.
-  Oh, wow, yes, okay.
- Did I do it?
All right, let us know
in the comments who did the best one.
-  Who did the best cartwheel?
- Missy, Jimmy, or Cassie.
-  Or Ollie or Finn, okay?
- And Ollie or Finn.
-  Finn, show me
your cartwheel, buddy.
Show me your cartwheel, Finn.
Yeah!
-  I can run!
-  Good flip,
Finn, good flip (laughs).
Whoa (laughs).
(gentle music)
Good job, dude.
These boys are getting their teeth clean.
Let me see your teeth.
- I'm trying to look in the mirror.
-  Oh, you are (laughs)?
(laughs) Ollie's gotten so
good at using his rinse stuff.
So, he just puts it in his
mouth and you swish it, right?
Yeah, hey, I like your PJs.
Who are you?
- I'm BB-8.
-  You're BB-8?
- Yeah.
- That's so cool.
We got the boys a matching
Star Wars pajamas.
Finn is so excited too, aren't you?
Hey, Finn, can you go
beep boop boo boop boop?
- I'm so excited it's Halloween.
-  It's almost Halloween!
Almost there.
-  (gasps) Did you miss Karma?
Aw, Finn.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he's playing with her.
I missed you so much
today, Karma, yes, we did.
We got to see Mayor Max.
Oh, Finn says it's time for bed.
(laughs) We are just climbing into bed.
We had such a fun day, huh, boys?
Did you have fun with Mimi
and Papa and Auntie and Uncle?
- We saw the Mayor Max.
- Yeah, we saw Mayor Max.
We had so much fun, huh?
You guys don't know,
Idlewild's mayor is a dog.
Mayor Max, I talk about it all the time.
Or every time we go up
there but it's so much fun.
Finley Jay, get back
here, it's time for bed.
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.
We had a ton of fun.
Make sure you give this
video a big thumbs up.
(toy growls)
Chewbacca thumbs up.
Thumbs up?
Whoa, oh gees (laughs).
- Thumbs up for me.
- Thumbs up.
(yells)
We'll see you guys tomorrow.
What do you say?
- Bye
boop.
(upbeat music)
