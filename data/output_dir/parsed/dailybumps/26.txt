- Where are you, Kelly?
Come back!
♪ This is our life ♪
♪ Let's live it ♪
♪ Live it forever ♪
-  Good morning!
- We are up this morning bright and early
and we are making pancakes.
Does that sound good, boys?
-  Yeah.
- We actually didn't have any pancake mix,
but we did have waffle mix, so I attempted
to modify the waffle mix,
and hopefully we're
gonna make some pancakes.
It's actually way past Valentine's,
but I just thought it'd be really fun
to make heart-shaped pancakes
out of these little cookie
cutters that I have,
so we'll see how it works
and if they actually turn out.
This poor kid, how are you doing today?
- Good.
-  Good, what is going on?
- My ear hurts.
- Aww, so if you guys don't know,
we have been doing a
little bit of swimming
the past few days 'cause
our pool is super warm
and it actually has been pretty nice,
although the cold weather is back,
but I think Ollie's got
a little earache, huh?
It's nothing too major yet.
He doesn't have a fever or anything,
but he just keeps saying it hurts,
which usually means that
he probably has outer
swimmer's ear, which he
gets every once in a while.
I got them a ton as a kid,
and it hurts to the touch.
So which ear hurts, bud?
- This one.
-  Oh, it hurts when you touch it.
- Yeah.
- Aww, I'm sorry.
So something that always
worked when I was a kid was
colloidal silver and so
we're gonna put a few drops
in and put a movie on
while I make the pancakes
and let this sit in your ear.
And this usually actually fixes it.
If it doesn't, we'll
take him to the doctor,
but this, honestly, usually does it.
It dries it all up and you
know what also does it?
Garlic, but that stuff smells disgusting.
Your kid will start to
smell like an Italian dish.
(laughs)
But I do use it,
they have garlic drops
and then they have the colloidal silver,
mix those together
and his ear should be good to go
within the next day or two.
All right, let's go ahead
and put some drops in.
You can show all the kids how easy
it is to do so no one's scared, okay?
All right, so we just
take this little syringe.
We just do two or three drops in his ear.
Good job.
Just like that.
Is it a little cold?
- Yeah.
(Missy laughs)
-  And then you
can just massage it in
so it goes into the ear canal.
Yay!
Finn, give your brother kisses
and tell him it'll be okay.
-  Be okay.
- Aww, all right, let's
put on a movie, 'kay?
(gentle music)
All right, we are dressed and ready
for the day and where are we headed?
- To Auntie's house!
- Yeah!
- We're actually headed
to Mimi and Papa's house
and Auntie is here.
- We are gonna film a video with Auntie.
-  Ooh, he gets so
excited when Auntie comes down
to film videos with him.
There she is!
- Hi, guys!
What are you doin'?
- Good.
- Are you ready to film?
- Yeah.
- You know what we're doin'?
- What?
- I'll tell you inside.
- (laughs) Okay.
-  Check it out,
my dad's car is sitting
outside of the house.
How's it been?
- Oh, pretty good.
-  Have you enjoyed it?
- Yeah, I've been enjoying it a lot.
I mean, I have locked
myself out of it twice.
-  So you guys know,
it has this special little
key fob 'cause it doesn't
have door handles,
which means all you have
to do is leave the keys
in there and close the
door and you can't get in.
- I started it and went, "Oh,
I gotta go get something,"
and I got out and went--
(Missy laughs)
I spent 30 minutes,
while the car's running.
-  Oh my, it's like
(imitates engine noises).
- Probably overheating and stuff,
trying to get a wire in there and stuff.
-  Oh my gosh, you're so silly.
-  Then I got it.
-  Yeah, well
hopefully you can fix that.
- Because it was a surprise
car, I didn't get to talk
to the guy and he told me
there's a release cable.
(Missy laughs)
You just gotta pull the cable.
-  Now he knows that,
so it'll probably make it a lot easier
for him to get in, but yeah.
I think Dad's enjoying it.
So I was actually only planning
to leave Ollie at the house,
but like I was thinking,
Finn was not having it.
I was driving away, he was like (screams).
So Auntie was nice enough
to say, "Hey, he can be
"in the video too."
I had to run to Target really quick.
I've got a big old bin back there.
A lot of stuff for my horse,
which I'm headed up to.
He has a training lesson right now,
so I'm gonna go up there
and hang out with him.
My dad's gonna help me
kind of spruce up his stall
and all that.
Yay, it's gonna be a fun day.
I get to see my horse.
All right, so I just go to the barn
and Nacho had this lesson
and he was pretty good.
But I want to show you guys
his new stall area.
Look how cute it is.
So I've got my little tack box
and then here I'm gonna get some pictures
of us in here, like me and Nacho
and the kids and Nacho.
I got some treats for us.
Up here, treats for the horses. (laughs)
And then what he eats and his name.
I think I'm gonna put
a little plant there.
So cute, I love it.
It's got stuff for hanging.
I think I wanna get a wreath here.
And this is Cosmo.
I am just totally obsessed
with my little area.
I think it's so cute.
And I have all my little letters here.
I'm gonna tear up.
But Finn's like, "I wanna go home!"
And he wants to go home,
so I'm leaving now.
Say, "I wanna go home!"
- I wanna go home!
-  He's just
sitting up here saying,
"Mom, hurry up."
- So Ollie and I just
got back from a haircut.
New digs, look at that, dude.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I have to say, our new
little Dory is doing so good.
She's getting along
with all the other fish.
No one's tried to attack
her, so that's awesome.
Check out this anemone.
Hey Ollie, can you say anemone?
- A-nem-o-ne.
-  An-en-o-me.
- An enemy.
-  An-en-o-me.
- I can't say it.
- He was pressing his
face up against the glass
and trying to say it.
- He's really big.
- It's so funny.
- Huh?
- He's really big.
-  That's the anemone.
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, so this
anemone right now is
actually white because it
has a like an antibiotic
to keep it alive.
But he said it's actually gonna change
to its original color, which is
like a bright purple or red.
And look at Dory, she's so happy, huh?
- She's so cute, and she's getting along
with everyone.
We've got some new little plants.
-  Oh yeah, those ones are out now,
so we got those.
-  I love that one.
-  Yeah, and Patrick's
still hangin' out right there.
- Lookee there, he's
actually getting ready
to bend back and catch some food.
-  So he's basically
saying he's in this current
right here, he's basically
catching all the food
that's coming out of there.
- So I think that means he's gonna live.
-  Yeah. (laughs)
- But look at him, he's
actually slowly taking
each little tentacle down
and pulling his little arm back.
It's the cutest thing.
-  It's crazy.
Yeah, he says, "I'm
gonna get me some food."
That is one of the new additions
that Missy picked out.
Very, very cool.
And then this one looks so cool, too.
It looks like a bunch of hands
sort of reaching up.
- Like little eyeballs.
(calm music)
Okay, so we are home
and I'm headed out to
check out my chickens.
We had a little bit of an
incident the other day.
Basically what happened
was my chicken coop
got so cold, and when it gets cold,
things kind of adjust in it.
It's probably because it's
just not really put down
on a solid foundation, but things adjust
and what happened was
this ended up just getting
so loose because it was
cold that it dropped open
and so one morning, chickens got out.
This was yesterday morning.
The sun comes up and
there's a way to get out,
they always wanna leave.
So they got out and I
didn't know they were out
and of course I let Luna out
when she wanted to go out,
which was very early, like
five a.m. I let her out.
I didn't even notice
that the chickens were
out until 8 a.m. and I
had already brought Luna
in after that.
So anyways, all my chickens
are there except one,
and no one is hurt, no one had any issues,
because Luna is kind of a crazy dog,
she's had some incidents with the chickens
a couple times, so here's all my chickens,
but I am missing one chicken
and the chicken I'm missing is Kelly.
I'm missing Kelly.
She was the gray and white speckled one.
Now, good news is she's not dead,
or at least didn't die by Luna at least.
Because there's no feathers and if,
I mean, to be honest, if she was dead,
Luna would have --
it would be around here.
So we haven't seen her.
She's not here.
I'm guessing she got scared and flew away
and is just either waiting for a safe time
when she can come back
or is lost, I'm not really sure.
So we are gonna go look for Kelly,
see if we can find her.
I'm hoping she's okay.
I have lost a chicken before
who's got scared and left,
and I swear it was lots of days later
that it actually did come back.
So I feel like she's gonna come back.
But we gotta see if we can find her first.
She's probably sitting in a bush, okay?
-  Okay.
-  Let's go see what we can find.
Uh, Ollie, I think I just found a clue.
Uh-oh guys, I actually
didn't see this yesterday.
There's a feather.
Karma, find this chicken.
There actually is a couple feathers.
Oh no, we have this bog ol'
pile of rocks right here
and I'm wondering if she flew in here
or got stuck in here.
That would be a pretty safe spot.
Nothing else would probably get her, but
she's gotta come out.
-  Yeah.
-  Is she in there?
Do you guys see her?
Did you see her?
- Yeah!
-  Oh gosh, no you didn't.
Kelly, where are you?
All right, we're looking down in here.
I really don't think she's in here.
This is honestly pretty
interesting, actually.
I see a feather there.
It feels really deep.
I do see feathers in there.
Look at that.
Those are definitely her feathers, but
I don't see her.
-  I see it!
-  What do you see?
-  I see.
-  Do you see feathers?
-  Yeah.
-  You checkin' in there?
-  Do you see the chicken?
-  No.
- I don't see her, I'm looking in
all these crevices, and I
just don't see anything.
I'm wondering if maybe she flew in here,
got scared, climbed up here and then just
flew over here, but gosh,
if she's over there,
I don't know where she could be
and I did see a coyote
back here this morning,
so hopefully she was able to hide.
-  Where's the chicken, Finn?
You really think she's in there?
- Yeah.
-  Karma's like,
"Really, really Missy?
"I can't protect you over there."
-  I wanna go over there.
- Let's see if it scares her.
-  Oh yeah, out of the bushes?
Ollie's got her feather.
You think it's gonna help find her?
- Yeah.
-  It's a clue, right?
- Yeah.
Maybe this is the wrong clue.
-  It's the wrong clue?
- I think so.
- Yeah, we need to find the right clue.
We're basically on a treasure
hunt for our chicken.
- I found another clue!
-  Another one?
-  Yeah!
- Another feather?
-  Yeah!
-  Not over there?
- No, well, I need some food.
-  Oh, you gotta shake food?
- I don't know how I'm gonna get back,
so I just might be lost too.
-  Okay, bye.
We lost Mama and the chicken.
Lookit, Finn's like, "How do I get over?"
There you go, babe.
It's just a silly little fence.
Ollie's got some chicken food.
Maybe we should throw it near the fence
and see if she comes, Ollie.
Here, grab some food
and come over here.
Actually, what if we put it right here?
Maybe it'll want to
come and get some food.
I hope she's okay.
- Yeah, me too.
- So it is cold.
Everyone seems to have abandoned me
of looking for the chicken.
I went around, shook food,
and kinda like put food places
to see if maybe she'll come out,
but my last resort is that I put Luna
in the house and I'm
letting the chickens out
and I'm hoping that
maybe by them, you know,
making all their sounds and all that,
she'll hear them and maybe come out
and see that it's safe.
All right, so you find Kelly,
tell her it's safe to come home
and she needs to come back
so she can be safe and
eat food and drink water.
I feel so bad that she's lost.
I really am sad that she is lost.
I'm really hoping that
she finds her way back.
And honestly, like I said,
this has happened before
and I remember being like,
I remember, I think it was like weeks
that she was gone, but maybe
it was just a few days,
but she was gone for a long time.
And I was like, "Guess she's gone,"
and then she just randomly
came back one day,
so we'll see.
You find Kelly, okay guys?
I'll keep Luna away from you guys.
Are you guys ready to go?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
-  Woo-hoo!
We're gonna go to dinner.
- All right, I'm all ready for dinner.
I just had to blow my nose.
I had a big old booger hanging from it.
What?
What?
Oh, it's another booger?
You pulled this booger
out of my nose, Ollie.
-  And your brain didn't pop out
when you pulled it out?
- No, is that happens in your brain?
-  Yeah, the brain just pops out
of the head.
-  That is scary.
-  Is that so silly?
- Yeah.
- Help me pick my booger.
-  Oh geez.
-  Finn, help him pick his booger.
-  Pick that booger out.
-  Grab it.
Oh, you got it.
(babbling)
-  You do it, guys.
-  Ah, you got a big one.
-  That actually
consisted of boogers.
-  All right,
Finn, climb in the car.
It's time to go, right here.
There you go.
-  Do you want me to help you?
-  No.
- Can I help you?
-  No.
- Here.
-  No.
- Here.
-  No!
-  Okay, well then, you get in!
-  Get in your seat!
-  Mr. Independent. (laughs)
He sees Ollie and he's like--
-  Can I just help you with this?
- No!
- Finn, come on then, get in the seat.
So funny because Ollie has been
so much more independent
at getting in the seat
and taking his buckles off
and putting them on,
and I think Finn has been taking notice.
-  Yeah, you have to let me--
Okay, get in the seat!
-  He's like, "Don't do it!"
Now he's just teasing you.
Whoa, dude, you are quite the climber.
Dude, what are you doing?
-  I shoe.
-  You're stuck in this giant shoe!
-  Just put one foot in there.
-  See if you can do it.
-  Just one foot.
-  There you go.
-  Look at that shoe!
You've got one little
foot and one big foot!
- Hi, guys!
- All right, Finn, what do
you say we go eat dinner?
(laughing)
He's excited.
- All right guys, we had a great dinner
and actually already put the boys to bed.
We had a really fun day.
I think I'm gonna go
ahead and end the video
and I'm gonna get ready for bed,
so make sure you give this video
a big thumbs-up if you did enjoy it.
I am really, really hoping
that Kelly comes back.
Please be thinking about her.
Hopefully we'll see her soon.
I'll let you guys know if she ends up
making her way back home.
For now, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Bye, boop.
(upbeat music)
