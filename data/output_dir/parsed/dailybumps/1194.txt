wall good job we're about to be no
longer a baby safe room by the way look
at this tarp passing her friends got
into like a paint war when they were
painting our room like it's everywhere
like I have painted many rooms with that
ladder but look at that lab right now
like one of the steps covered in green
she has one of these and it's covered in
paint covered it I have one of these
I've painted probably two three rooms
with it there's like one little dot up
here where the paint sometimes you know
happens if I paint on my hands I usually
like wash it off pretty quickly so that
it doesn't get back yeah it's just three
teenage girls painting a bedroom all
right kid we got to go this ain't safe
for you no moss Oh
karma you want to play too just had some
lunch and now I'm playing with ollie you

all morning can't seem to get him on
camera because he climbs off maybe maybe
no you're honoring we still have Papa's

so Papa's birthday present here because
we're waiting until they get all settled
over in the new house to bring it over
there but he's pretty excited about that
though what are you doing buddy you have
so many toys what do you want to play
with the box you want to set up the
grill for Papa all right guys I just
finished the first coat of this room is
definitely going to need a second coat I
don't know if you guys can see all the
blotches in the camera it's really need
a really good second coat but I'm
excited I got the first coat done and I
get actually fairly quickly I feel like
I did it
best in the living room so that's good
and I did it all myself I didn't have
any help whatsoever it's really really
love this color and I think my mom's
gonna like it it's very I feel like it's
a very relaxing color you can do
anything with it like you can match any
kind of bedding and you know stuff like
that I don't know if I show you guys the
finished product of the living room but
we're just starting to take off the
green tape but here's what it looks
like I think it looks so pretty you can
kind of see that white border and how
the this looks and I just think it looks
really really really nice it's very like
very subtle vanilla cream color I think
it looks really good so we're gonna live
here together
okay we're together and yeah are yeah
yes yeah I always say my mom's house or
my dad's like oh wait okay I live there
too and a long we're like are your mom
dad splitting up

whole like it's they're just thinking as
a package they're one they are one and

kind of just learned it's not really
worth it
I need like a printer and a fax machine
because I have so many like things that
I'm supposed to fill out and like sign
and send and like fax to people and I
can never to it so a fax machine and a
printer would make my life so much
easier so I do need to go out and find
one of those but I'm like Friday it's a
free day today mommy's painting I should
go get some things done but I know it's
crazy out there you know do you guys

threads and ordered like a bunch of new
shirts for ollie because he needs new
clothes and they were 40% off so that
was actually a pretty good deal I'm
finally done we got done doing almost
all the kitchen who got it like pretty
much all together but we've taken off
all the tape and we put all these things
