car to nine hours to nap hours how many
hours do we have left at least an hour

we need to be a not lane but we keep
forgetting to buy the stupid things we
can go into the fast lane it's in
California there's so much traffic you
can buy a thing to go into a different
Lane like a toll thing thing I don't
know I don't know I feel you bro I feel
you
high-five comet looking with a wiggling
away away thing at the end that would be
the fashion yeah the fun thing is a
toilet and water and dinner when you

of the road and like pass all traffic
just cuz we actually might be going to
LA a lot more Missy did really good on
the way back she did throw up until we
got home she ran straight into the
