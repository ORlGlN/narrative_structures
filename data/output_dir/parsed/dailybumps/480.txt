Oh

can check hey did you see that look he
looked at me like you are so
embarrassing daddy will go up to a ton
of snow it's still snowing it's crazy
outside and I don't really have any snow
things so I'm kind of bummed but I think
this has definitely prepared us for the
cold we are about to experience in
London so we got to make sure to bundle
up what what Finn what are you gonna say
okay okay yeah that was riveting story
nothing like a little morning twister to
get your body all ready for the day huh

you
we are headed down the mountain it is so
foggy like it looks like it is snowing
right now that's like all downhill and
you can't hear you see anything boo-ki
yeah it's kind of scary sometimes me and
Brian act like Californians but the
truth is we actually are from Idaho and
we've dealt with a lot of snow in our
life and we've also been quite
traumatized by snow and we don't like
driving in snow we don't like being in
snow or ice or crashed into fences
we've got into ditches stitches and so
one time Brian went into a ditch so deep
that you couldn't even see his car yeah
and my dad had to like get him out it
was crazy
it was like really really late the roads
were literally just like ashy I still
think I'm lucky to be alive I know what
Sam was really scary
so and my dad is very traumatized by
snow but he was a driver in Idaho so
sometimes again like we act like we're
Californians and we like oh my gosh no
but we're not from Idaho we know snow
and they know what it's we know we're
kind of screwed that's why we come up
here and we enjoy it and then we leave
