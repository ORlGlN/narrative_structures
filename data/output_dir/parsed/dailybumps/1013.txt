what is he floating on his belly did you

his own
good morning guys this morning I am
taking over our backyard y'all better
watch out okay y'all if you're if you're
a palm tree and you're in our way we
take you down no prisoners good morning
guys today is Cassie's graduation party
and we're gonna have 25 people in this
backyard feeding them we're gonna be
swimming we're gonna be hanging out and
have a good time in celebrating Cassidy
and I should probably put this knife
down now shun today sorry I'm and so
I've been kind of like taking back my
backyard this morning and that includes
chopping down these bad boys because
these are beautiful and amazing but they
get in your way like we could barely
even walk across his path because all
these ones were like taking over my
grill was completely covered with them
also and look it kind of still is but I
was able to get rid of and clear that
opening over there cleaned up around the
pool nice and neat I swept cleaned all
the windows cleaned up all the chairs oh
another thing is we have these doves
really awesome doves them they're
beautiful they're they sound awesome and
they hang out in these trees and from
time to time they like to sit along our
pool fence here
which is not a good thing because then
they sit and all they do is poop poop
poop poop poop poop poop so I've been
cleaning up poop from karma and the
birds just trying to make sure that
everything looks nice but I don't know
if you guys know this but because we
have so many palm trees we actually we
don't waste these what happens is when
the gardener or myself cuts them down
sorry they're oh watch out karma
good morning karma how's it going buddy
we actually just take them and throw
them right on this little gazebo thing
what poof and then if they're green
they'll turn that yellow color that
brown and it will provide even more
shade because as you can tell there are
some holes and stuff so we've definitely
been needing some leaves for the little
gazebo area so I'm going to take that
pile and put it on top of there
morning guys hope you guys had a great
Sunday we are getting ready to celebrate
Cassy oh my goodness we've been cleaning
up like crazy just because you know
we're having a party we want everything
to be nice and clean and so I've just
been keeping up with dishes and I
actually do have this load of laundry to
fold and then the family's coming over

graduation party and then everyone comes

out so much I'm sorry

his nap and I missed doing some
last-minute cleaning I'm gonna put a
towel in the bathroom because people
