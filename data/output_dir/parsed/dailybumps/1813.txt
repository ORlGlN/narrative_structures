take those ones leave them are nice
really ain't you got one but can they
withstand the shoe dance laundry
of what what do you what do you mean
actually I'm pregnant
good morning guys does this ever happen
you in the morning I actually woke up
and as you're seeing sock I think my bed
ate it so I have horrible memory missies
always telling me to do things and I'm
always forgetting like she will go to
the shower and say hey can you make the
bed and I'll hear her completely and
I'll be like I'll make the bed that's
not wrong and then she walks in the room
finds the bed I mean it was like one
human to bed and I literally attribute
it to my bad my bad memory and I think
that's one of the reasons that I was
never a good test taker in college
because I heard the ever passed test in
college I was just not a good test taker
at all and I always feel like it's
getting worse like you see remembers
things about our past when we were in
high school
and I seriously don't remember any of
them when it was all just like a blur
like I literally don't remember what I
ate that yesterday morning for breakfast
so I'm always worried that I'm always
kind nervous because it's just so sad I
mean have you seen the notebook that's
ridiculous I don't want that to happen
to me but I always forgot to miss it
because she always tells me to do things
like put the clothes in the dryer and
then I forget it and then I have to do
it like an hour later and she's mad
done this is this supposed to be a
rattle so weird-looking rattle I can see
you
Oh weird oh no I just showed the baby
clothes we bought uh-oh I can't believe
I'm showing you guys this Oh No
just give away a ton we're having twins
girl and boy so if you thought it was
just one you're wrong someone commented
the other day asking if we eat the fruit
for that we buy from Izzy's bum dates
and I just want to show you this this is
basically in origin answer your question
we eat the fruit unless something gross
like the prune yeah hello the way what
other ones did we eat we didn't eat the
nectarine because they weren't like yeah

mad at you right now it's mine why are
you my cookie you taste just like a
strawberry cookie this one is probably
like no I didn't taste peanut butter
anywhere this one is probably like the
most normal that I've tasted which is a
sad thing to say I asked the Petco lady
and she said that she tried all the kind
that's in the bag to like slow motion
can you dance for me
it's dance dance dance dance I'm in a
party halftime
dance dance all right there you go oh
come on so the other morning I was
getting out of bed and I immediately
felt nauseous which I've gone pretty
much a whole week without feeling any
kind of nauseousness like I've been
feeling pretty good come on he wants to
play the toy oh I kind of felt nauseous
and I was like ugh and as I started to
walk to the bathroom I realized that I'm
gonna throw up so I went into the
bathroom and I don't really have any
food in my stomach so I was mostly just
you know doing the whole dry heaving
thing but this is the first time this
happened I completely peed myself oh my
gosh oh yeah I felt like a failure too
but I really I should say um yeah I just
started throwing up and all of a sudden
I was like oh my god I guess it's normal
if you're pregnant but it was so
horrible I like had to go and take a
shower I literally clean it up because I
it's just like leaning over and like
peeking into the toilet so it was like
horrible and then I posted on there oh I
read like so I've read it like probably
over 30 funny hilarious stories about
other pregnant women you know and them
having problems while being pregnant it
was so funny
some say they still have problems yeah
like they kind of like if you have a
baby sometimes that happens and I'm not
really embarrassed by it it's more like
a funny story because you know I'm
pregnant and that stuff happens so
whatever look at Carmen he's being so
gentle with the monkey yeah you know so
soon it rip it doesn't you were talking
I saw him like licking it Hey Oh your
monkey we know for you okay you like
slide it's okay I guess we spoke too
soon why would you do this come on you
knew you're supposed to be gentle with
it make it good enough it you tore open
his leg you were not supposed to do that
he's like a stuffed animal what do you
think is supposed to do with it yeah all
