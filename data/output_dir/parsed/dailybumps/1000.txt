little house over here are you looking
for him good morning guys and Happy
Father's Day today is Father's Day
if all they are up bright and early and
we're getting ready to make breakfast
for Brian I've got a few gifts for him
and I'm really excited to just celebrate
Brian today cuz he is such a good dad
and I feel like being a good dad does
not just have to do with like taking
care of your kid it kind of has to do
with being a good husband and being like
like a help to the mom who usually ends
up taking on a lot of the
responsibilities but he tries to step in
wherever he can and it's just so nice
and makes him a good dad especially when
I'm pregnant cuz he can't really be a
good dad to this little boy other than
just helping me and he does really good
at that he definitely takes care of us
very well so today it's all about Brian
and so we've got gifts from me and all
I've been playing something special
hallo and we're gonna make some
breakfast for making french toast bacon

5:00 a.m. mama does not do 5:00 a.m. huh

really hard we had a photo shoot in the
house while Brian was out of the house
and we took pictures
her daddy he had such a great relaxing
morning was a good friend

special photo shoot but there was a part
of this photo shoot was a lot of just me
and I probably will never show you them
so that they are really special and nice
they were nice oh yeah I have like
beautiful pictures on my wife now
yes it's something I definitely had to
step out my comfort zone and if I feel
like it I might do a video on my channel
if you guys are interested in it just
because I think that it's something that
a lot of women don't have the courage
and the confidence to do and it was hard
it definitely was hard for me to get the
confidence to do it but I think it's
really special it's something really
great for your husband I think you have
to tell him it's a boudoir photo shoot
it's not like anything else no it's just
just like classy tasteful it's not it's
not it was not like bad at all but now
