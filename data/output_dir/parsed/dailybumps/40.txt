- Good morning, guys.
So, a lot has happened
(laughs) since the last video.
If you guys didn't see yesterday's video,
I'm gonna have it linked up in the I-card,
you can go back and watch it,
so you kind of understand where we're at.
We had a really, really hard
day yesterday, Missy and I.
It was a huge rollercoaster of emotions.
And we had some travel already lined up,
we were gonna be in Vegas for CES,
we have some meetings here,
and so we already had this travel set up.
So we are now here,
and we kind of got here
and put everything on hold.
We kind of just took
some time to think about
what we want to do and what
we should do, and can do.
So we're kind of taking
a break from all the work
we had planned, and we're
using this as an opportunity
to just be together and
just try to have that time
where we can like, reflect
and have a little fun,
and process, because a
lot happened yesterday.
Yesterday, Missy and I
hugged our boys for a very,
very long time, and we
were probably so annoying.
And if you watch yesterday's
vlog, you'll know why.
But it was just one of those things
where you can't help
but be affected by it.
Our boys just kinda loved on us yesterday,
and it was what we needed.
And now they're hanging
out with Mimi and Papa,
they're totally cool, and they're happy,
which is awesome.
And we get to have a little
bit of time to ourselves
here in Vegas.
But there's a couple of really cool things
in our hotel that we
wanted to show you guys.
So we figured maybe
we'll pick up the camera
and vlog a little bit about
that, and have some fun.
Sound good?
We saw a show last night,
and they gave Missy a rose,
so I think she's already wowing the crowd.
Funny story about roses
actually, and Missy...
When Missy and I were in high school
and we first started dating,
I gave her a rose every
single day for a long time.
I think it ended up
being like, six months.
But I worked at a grocery,
I think I worked at
Albertson's, I was a bagger.
Every day after my shift, I
would buy a single red rose
for I think it was probably like,
a buck or three bucks or something.
And I would bring it to her,
and it was just a funny time.
And so whenever I see roses now,
I think of that time in our lives,
because I know she really liked it.
But anyway, Missy is
downstairs at the restaurant,
so let's go meet up with her.
(upbeat music)
Look at this giant map
of the United States!
It's America, babe! (laughs)
Eatin' pasta in America.
Oh, are you Facetiming?
- Yeah, my mom.
- Hey, oh, the boys!
What are the boys up to?
- Hi Daddy!
-  Hey dude!
Miss you, buddy!
Hi, Finn!
(Missy laughs softly)
Oh, they're having so much
fun with Mimi and Papa.
(upbeat music)
-  We're gonna do
it on three, you ready?
One, two, three!
- Hey guys!
- Hey guys!
- Hi!
- (laughs) That was perfect!
(Mimi giggles)
Okay, we're gonna play hide and seek.
- Yeah, yeah!
- Okay, then Mimi and Ollie, versus who?
- Uh-uh!
-  Uh-uh's here!
Uh-uh, in case you didn't
know, is what Finn calls Uncle.
He calls him Uh-uh!
- Ollie's gonna help us now.
-  I'm gonna take a
kid, and I'm gonna hide it,
like here, here, hide!
Where's Finn?
(Finn shouts)
(Papa exclaims in surprise)
(Finn giggles)
-  We'll try to
find a better hiding spot!
-  And someone needs
to teach Finn how to hide!
-  Okay, here we go.
Where's Finn?
Has anybody seen Finn?
Finn, oh, come on, Finn!
(giggling)
-  Whoever's on Finn's
team is totally gonna lose.
-  Uh-uh!
-  Uh-uh's on Finn's team!
- Me and Papa!
-  Okay.
-  So no one say, "Where's
Finn?", or the game's over.
-  Okay, Finn, you've
got to sit over here,
you and Uh-uh.
-  We've got to close our eyes.
- Okay, ready?
- Yes.
- Okay, go team Ollie!
-  What are we counting to?
- 400!
-  Okay, let's make it 30!
-  Okay, go right
up there. I can see you.
Not a good hiding spot.
-  Go, Papa, hurry!
- One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...
29, 30!
-  What do you say?
-  Ready or not, here we come!
(Finn squeals happily)
Can you say ready or not?
(Finn babbles)
(Mimi and Uh-uh laugh)
-  Alright, here we go!
- I found Papa.
-  Oh, that's a
terrible hiding spot.
- I hid the boy!
-  Oh, you hid him.
- Went through the front
gate, down the street.
-  And he knows to be quiet?
- He's in the house and
he knows to be quiet.
-  Okay, here we go, Finn!
Finn, you find Ollie!
-  Okay, we gotta be thorough here.
Let's check the bathroom.
-  Yeah.
-  Is he in there?
- No.
-  No?
Wanna check the closet?
- Okay!
-  This is Mama's Monica closet!
-  No!
-  Not in there!
Do you wanna check in Mama's room?
Okay, let's go check, go in
there, start looking around!
(playful music)
- No?
-  No, you don't see him?
No, not in the closet!
(Ollie giggles)
Did you hear that?
- Yeah.
-  What was it?
- Him!
-  Is it Ollie?
Where do you think he is?
-  If Ollie's hiding somewhere,
he needs to be quiet!
(Mimi laughs)
Wherever you are, Ollie,
you need to be quiet!
-  Could he be behind
those moving clothes?
(Papa laughs)
Oh, we found him!
Good game, good game, good game!
- I'm gonna say that Ollie
is the second-worst hider
in the world, because I
know who the worst hider is!
-  Finn!
- Who's the worst hider?
-  Finn!
-  Ollie, come over here.
-  Are we ready?
-  You've gotta come
over here and count to 400.
Ready, go!
- Come on, we gotta go!
(Mimi laughs)
-  One, two, three, four, five...
-  16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21...
-  27, 28, 29, 30!
- Ready or not, here I come!
- Okay, let's see here.
Alright, here we go guys.
Off to find Finley.
-  Wait, wait, not under there.
-  Under here?
No!
This is the worst hide and seek ever!
-  In here, no.
-  In here, no.
-  We know he's gonna giggle.
-  I don't know.
Okay, do you really think
they're gonna put him
in the exact same spot you just were?
I don't think so.
-  Did they both hide?
I'm sure Uncle is helping him stay hidden.
Alright, I think we
need to leave this area.
Let's move on!
-  Are you ready?
Look out!
That's toilet paper.
The laundry room?
- Okay.
-  Do you see anything?
-  No.
-  That light is on,
that's his old nursery.
Do you think he could be in there?
(Mimi gasps)
(Finley shouts and laughs)
(Mimi and Papa laugh)
-  Wait, we're missing Uncle!
-  Where is he?
-  Do you know where Uh-uh is?
- No!
-  No?
-  Is he in...
-  I don't know where he is.
Wait, let's take a quick look around.
Let's just take a quick
look around the room.
Do you see anybody?
-  I see him!
-  Where, I don't see him!
-  He's in the mirror!
-  In the mirror?
-  He's right there!
-  Right there?
-  He's in the back of the mirror!
(laughing)
-  Oh my god, I
thought he was trapped
in the mirror.
-  That was a pretty good game,
thanks for playing, guys!
Say, "Thanks for playing, Uh-uh!"
(children mumble)
Thanks for playing, Papa!
Alright, let's go.
- So I'm really excited,
because as you know,
Missy loves chocolate!
So we're headed into
Hershey's Chocolate World,
which is actually inside of our hotel,
so we don't even have to leave.
- And you better believe
I'm getting stuff for my dad!
- And it looks amazing.
Yeah, Missy's dad loves
Hershey's chocolate.
Oh, look, they still have
their Christmas wreath up!
- It's still Christmas here!
- I thought we were
bad 'cause we just took
our Christmas decorations
down a couple of days ago.
Look at this!
It smells so good, babe.
- It really does.
(Bryan laughs)
(upbeat music)
- Chocolate Liberty?
Look at this Hershey's
chocolate Statue of Liberty.
500 pounds of chocolate, babe!
(upbeat music)
So my favorite chocolate has
always been dark chocolate.
I love dark chocolate, and I
actually really do not like
milk chocolate, and Misty is
a huge milk chocolate fan.
What did I tell you guys?
Missy is a huge milk chocolate fan.
(laughs)
- I thought I was like,
putting this on my ice cream.
(Missy and Bryan laugh)
-  I know, right?
- I could really do that with it all.
-  Are these real?
Oh, no. Oh my gosh, that's so funny.
- You could take good ones, like...
-  Yeah! (laughs)
(upbeat music)
Look at this giant Hershey's Kisses!
Whoa, that's cool!
What?
-  Look at that!
-  This exists?
It's a cupcake covered
in chocolate, oh, wow.
We gotta try that.
- I'm focusing.
(Bryan laughs)
I can't eat chocolate
anymore the way I used to.
- I know, it's actually really sad.
Oh my, look at all those strawberries!
See this is my favorite, it's
chocolate-dipped strawberries.
- I don't like--
-  I was telling them
how you don't like dark chocolate,
you don't really like dark chocolate.
You like milk chocolate.
- Yeah, I'm more of a
milk chocolate person.
- And I'm dark chocolate.
So let us know down below in the comments,
what do you like?
Milk or dark, or white?
But white's not really a chocolate.
- I mean, is white
chocolate a chocolate, no.
-  All this looks so amazing!
Oh, wow, look at that, babe.
Peanut butter swirl brownie sandwich.
Like, I'm just, like
drooling over all this
amazing looking food right now.
- I'm not eating any of it.
(Bryan laughs)
- Is this actual Rolos?
It's full of Rolos, but it's
also a little piggybank!
-  Oh, that's cool. Baby!
- World's largest Hershey bar!
-  Should we get that for my dad?
- I think he'll love it.
(Missy laughs)
Or hate it, he might hate this.
-  Yeah, my mom
would be so mad. (laughs)
-  Oh, that is
so cute for the boys.
- I'm really gonna get these.
And they're like, super soft material.
- Oh, cool. They have 'em, Missy!
The hat and shirt collection.
This is what we get your
dad any time we travel.
We always get Missy's dad
the hat and shirt combo.
- I was looking for this exactly.
-  So look, they
have the Hershey's Vegas,
but this is a cool color!
-  That is a cool color.
-  He'd probably
wear this one more, though.
-  I think gray, and
you don't know what it says
until you realize it's about chocolate.
This is perfect!
- Alright, we couldn't
decide, so we're getting both.
(laughs)
(upbeat music)
We are now at the amazing
candy machine here
at Hershey's Chocolate
World, and it's insane!
Look, you can fill your own bag
with any type of candy you desire.
There is Caramel, Milk Chocolate,
Dark Chocolate, Almond,
Hershey's Hugs, Cherry
Cordial, Carrot Cake.
-  Ew!
-  That's cool, no? (laughs)
(upbeat music)
Okay, so we are heading upstairs now,
and I'm going to try my
chocolate-dipped strawberry.
-  Hershey's chocolate-dipped.
(Bryan murmurs in agreement)
Pretty good?
That strawberry doesn't look
as good as the ones back home.
- Cali strawberries are still the best.
(Missy laughs)
So now we are going up
to the second story.
- Ooh, is that made of
chocolate? (chuckles)
The whole building's made of chocolate.
And it gets really hot here in Vegas,
so I can't imagine that's
like, a good thing in summer.
- Whoa, it's all Reese's up here, babe!
-  Ooh, so cool!
Reese's is like my favorite.
(upbeat music)
You're like, in a giant Reese's Cup.
- I know, I'd like to
eat my way through it.
(Missy laughs)
(upbeat music)
Babe, look at this.
They have a Statue of Liberty
made out of Twizzlers?
- Twizzlers, yeah.
-  That's crazy. (laughs)
-  It says don't touch, but like,
I want to touch it so bad.
-  I know, I
wanna feel it! (laughs)
Look at that. That's incredible.
- You can see the kinds they used up there
are the ones that peel off.
(upbeat music)
- Are you kidding me with
that smell right now, Vegas?
Are you kidding me?
Do you smell that, babe?
Fresh New York pretzels, right here.
That's awesome.
(upbeat music)
That's so cool, they have
Houdini's Magic Shop!
I could totally get
something for the boys.
- Let's go pick it up!
- To like, play a trick on them.
(upbeat music)
-  Alright, you found three books?
- Yeah, we just need one more book!
-  One more?
That one too, oh, that
one, who knows this one?
I read that to my kids
when they were little.
Alright, guys, we're
gonna be saying goodnight,
can you come down here?
We're gonna say goodnight.
Say thanks for watching.
- Thanks for watching!
-  Say goodnight!
- Night!
-  Thumbs up, and
we'll say, what do you say?
-  Bye!
-  Bye!
(upbeat music)
