you can't even do a little disco here
watch this oops oops oops oops how are
you I guess
did you really I did
good morning bumpers I am drinking my
shake and I'm feeling good it's a
beautiful day you know I just realized
we don't ever really ask how you guys
are doing and this is a two-way
conversation you guys were talking about
us when we talk to you so leave in the
comments below how are you feeling today
what's going on you know are you
struggling with something are you happy
about something let me know and I'll try
and respond to some I got bumper to
bumper radio or on baby watch right now
you guys could happen anytime we're just
trying to prepare ourselves mentally and
have the hospital back close to the door
and I really gotta say guys we actually
shot a video where Missy is telling
everyone she's in labor and we have it
up on her channel but it will only go
live as soon as we're on the way to the
hospital so we're on the way to the
hospital I'm gonna like just jump on my
phone make the video live so you guys
will know right away when she's in labor
on her pregnancy channel the bum song
the way which you can only subscribe to
in the link in the description so that's
really really exciting that we actually
did that good morning everyone so today
is going to be a fun day I've got lots
going on it is so hot like and really it
hasn't been that high we never take 90s
and that's not even that bad for the
around here but now that I'm full-term I
think that I'm just really starting to
feel that whole pregnant during the
summertime which is nice though because
at least it hasn't been like the whole
like summer time that I've been
miserable it's just the last couple
weeks and so that's kind of nice and I
just realized Carmen's got this toy out
I know if you guys remember a few days
ago a few weeks ago we actually got this
from a subscriber and this he has still
has not torn up he usually grabs him and
just tears him up but there's a few toys
that he will just sometimes hold on to
and he doesn't want to tear them up and
you know just play with them you don't
want that one to get thrown away cuz you
ripped all this stuffing out yeah
little learning with karma I don't know
if that's the right word but let's see
if you can do it so he's got all his
toys lined up and we're gonna ask him
karma can you get your frisbee where's
your frisbee karma get your frisbee
good job boy good boy okay let's try
another one
we have to put away the frisbee
otherwise he just keeps going for it
okay Carm are you ready for the next one
all right
karma get your snowman karma this is
your snowman right here he just doesn't
know what to do
are we playing or not he's usually
better than that but he is a little bit
sidetracked today aren't you karma by
the way if you haven't noticed already
yes me and my sister are wearing the
same shirt
and she looks my cuter in it but like
it's so funny because I bought my sis
shirt like forever ago and the other day
she was wearing her shirt and I was like
why are you wearing my shirt and then we
realized that she went shopping like a
few days ago and bought the same exact
shirt as me and she didn't mean it and
she's wearing a small and I'm wearing a
large and so now actually then you mean
to we just ended up wearing the same
shirt today oh we both have braids too
so I'm out braving this heat with my
family I think I'm gonna get my eyebrows
waxed
which is like the best place ever
so that was a fun experience yeah my
eyebrows cream might hurt really badly
and I think I'm swelling over here but
I'm not like super impressed but that's
okay
I got it done at least and that's always
the hardest part is actually going there
and doing it so just got off work and
I'm at the brewery with some guys but
this brewery is so cool look at all
these barrels they got going on and they
have like huge things over there and
they have this big ole miss machine I'm
not sure why I need a Miss machine but
it's pretty cool Missy has got the whole
Katniss braid going on do you know that
she doesn't even know you guys also
noticed the eyebrows guys that's a
that's a good tip out there if you know
your wife is doing something with the
whole face or hair or something make a
mental note to look at it
you got to mention it you guys if you
don't mention it then you're in trouble
she made me almost cry oh do you
remember when we did that the threading
all man when we first started this vlog
we did threading and miss you got her
eyebrows so I had to try it out and it
was the worst thing ever and then we
were doing like this dare week and I
actually got my eyebrows threaded I'll
see if I can find the videos and put it
in the description but you should go
look because they're hilarious I am
making dinner tonight and I got my
chicken all pre-portion down so I'm just
defrost thing that but I'm gonna do a
little just some noodles with sauce and
so I got some Hotel noodles some cheesy
ragu which is actually like a light
alfredo throw in some chopped red pepper
which I love and then maybe spinach I
love baby spinach it's got a lot of iron
it's super good too super food and I
just want to say a lot of people been
telling me that I should use my fitness
pal and I just want to say My Fitness
Pal isn't actually very good because the
food that's in the system it has been
entered by people who use it and so it's
not 100% accurate and actually you can
watch a lot of YouTube videos like I did
of people showing like the difference
and you know when you're counting
calories and like grams of fat and stuff
like that those things add up and so I
would highly recommend the lose it
because they actually work with with the
brands
and like the restaurants and stuff to
get the accurate the accurate
nutritional info all right miss usually
does this I know that's weird that Missy
is the one who cuts my belt over but she
does it cuz she likes the smell of it
which actually smells so good I love
fresh bell pepper all right so nice
outside playing with Karma he is just
loving this backyard I really we all are
we're just so so happy with this house
in this backyard and Carmen just gave me
his ball to throw for him hey ready hey
yeah I want to let you guys know though
I I often talk about someone on YouTube
her name is Sarah Louise
I'll have her to her channel linked
below
she's like exactly the same amount of
weeks as me she's probably like one week
ahead of me actually and she's just like
this cutest girl that I met on YouTube
and we talk all the time and she's had a
lot of issues through this pregnancy a
lot of high blood pressure and whatever
and so the plan was that she was
actually gonna be delivering him
tomorrow but she's actually delivering
him right now so I'm so excited and so
nervous for her all at the same time I
just can't wait I'm just hoping and
praying that they have a safe delivery
but I can't wait to see him he were both
having boys so it's just been really
exciting getting to have like a friend
through this pregnancy that's like the
same amount of weeks and we kind of
experience like the exact same things at
the exact same time but if you guys want
to check out her channel she I mean
she's about to have a baby so if you
want to see her baby you guys should go
check her out
all right so got my chicken growing I
got the noodles boiling and getting
everything ready got my bell pepper all
kitted and then you throw it all
together in a pot and why not so good
just like super simple super fast food
all together and it's nutmeg I wanted to
show you guys something really cool that
Haley in Virginia actually sent us karma
came here she actually sent us it's
really cool
leash come here boy come here
and when you push it it lights up is
that cool boy you can't even do a little
disco here watch this it's so Missy just
got done filming her bum day and she
revealing something really funny about
peeing while you're pregnant and it may
be hard to understand so she's gonna
give you guys a demonstration okay so I
kind of tried to describe it on
something that'll show it t now this is
gonna be a little weird
okay I'm gonna actually go faster okay
so this is how I do it so of course it's
own toilet it's so funny though it's and
so weird so in order for me to get all
the pee out and for it to actually like
tongue out I have to do this it's so
uncomfortable and so painful my belly is
like I think he gets wish to do they
like leaned up against the toilet I was
like oh wow there's a little pregnancy
TMI for you guys
I was major teen I didn't know what it
was like my piece yeah well I mean
they're following someone who's pregnant
you're gonna get a little TMI sometimes
it's just the truth of the matter super
lopsided right now yeah yeah hopefully
he stays exactly in his position if not
maybe he just turn a little bit
he actually didn't run away when I
started the camera
oh it's cuz you're like giving him this
amazing massage look at him - this stuff
we also got this one down here Claire
bear Claire Claire bear Clarence okay
karma stared him down Claire don't get
to choose
now you gotta be up here for protection
and if you guys don't know yes our cat's
name is Claire yes he has a boy I
thought he was a boy and so our girl
whom first got him and so it named him
Claire then we found out was a boy and
now he's he's still Claire bear we all
get that question when we say his name
they're like everyone's like Claire
isn't a boy so yeah Claire's short for
Clarence but not really he's still
Claire bear he still at Clary bears
always be you're Claire bear he he goes
around the neighborhood and he's like hi
my name's Claire he doesn't talk what
are you talking about
to all the other kitties like they all
mean they're like hey my name is Bella
and he's like my name's Claire and then
they all look at it make fun of her and
after how much drugs did you do when you
witness this I just imagine him when he
meets all his other cats and he wants to
be all tough and mighty cuz he's like a
tough cat and he has to tell them that
his name is Claire my name is Claire
bear are you
I don't think we can see you anyway I'm
gonna end the vlog as you know I'm using
Missy's camera she hey can you be quiet
in there I'm trying to end the vlog as
you can see I'm using Missy's pink
camera and to be honest my camera kind
of sucks it's got like stuff on the
screen I can't get off it's falling
apart it was super cheap I'm pretty sure
I bought like a reverb when we first did
it I don't know
Missy's is like super durable that's
probably really it that's why really
annoying huh then I tap it like that but
I definitely want to get a new one and
I'm you know what they have green ones I
think I should get agreement what do you
guys think should I stick with the black
or should I get a green one I think the
green one be cool I don't know what
anyway we're going to bed you want to
say good goodnight since you're so
talkative in the shower alright guys
