oh yeah he's that bass okay
look at how cute she is there you go we
were going to name what what I did
did you really I did
good morning guys um as you can see I'm
still wearing yesterday's shirt because
I don't know what I'm doing with my life
some people were asking about the Perry
hat in my closet and I haven't worn this
thing in a while but I love Perry the
Platypus um and when I bought it I wore
it all the time and I think I just got
it at Walmart when everything like Perry
was like blowing up and stuff you know
what I just realized is yesterday when
we were at the beach I was getting ready
and I had my my new sunglasses that I
just got and I set them on top of the
car and I left him there and then we
went back they were gone so not a pair
of sunglasses man she like monopolizes
the group by he's like that friend that
when you ask him to come hang out all
they do is talk about themselves she's
like oh you don't tape on me buddy
thinks he's so cute hi what are you
doing well did you find a ball
you found a ball no that's not ball
you're not supposed to play with these
wait what is that
that's the it's the dryer thing now we
use these like dry our clothes instead
of dryer sheets that's why he likes it
huh I know I think our three guards
right go get your crocodile going to
calm down
ah your crocodile that's to tear to
pieces but me got it
boy here you go I did it here you go
thank you you're so smart he says why
yes you are
karma my game
it's my lazy game not your lazy game no
karma no come here come in sit
give me let me the ball good luck good
luck commit sit drop it drop it so I
have been sitting here kind of being
lazy like super lazy like friends like
come on Missy let's do stuff yeah I was
just look at my belly button and look at
I brought a new little Ally on it sorry
to all the belly button haters out there
but he's such a bummer I don't know what
the problem is but now it's got like a
little like scalp almost so that kind of
sucks
hopefully it'll heal up again though
okay so we are out now and as you can
tell we are going swimming but I guess
it's so hot it's almost too hot to go
swimming there's my brother it's like
literally blazing hot out here
Brian just turned on the car and just
like nope I will be in the house until
is cool enough to get in the car so
hopefully he comes daggers soon because
I would like to get into water now it
says it's a hundred and six the air as
it the air conditioner as it hits you
turns warm before it hits you it don't
looks like it's not colder that's so
hard
Brian came out of the house finally so
yeah it's not fun here right now yeah
but my glass is up there and now they're
like fill up it could like brand you oh
my god this kind of weather is not fun
it's special I do hear that it's better
in this area because we have a dry sheet
whereas like if you were to go towards
like the beach or maybe like Florida
it's just as hot but you have that
humidity that's just terrible okay hang
on me and Brian actually just posted a
picture on Instagram letting people know
we had a lot of pictures that were
tagged in but a lot of people have their
profiles set to private so we don't get
a chance to look at them we can't even
see who gate who like sent us the
notification because it just pops up for
a second and then it goes away you can
go to our Instagram and follow us and
you can see what we're talking about but
if you go into your profile you can
actually click it from photos are
private you can say off so that way we
can actually if you want us to see them
if you don't want your Instagram yeah
like then we can I mean if you want them
to be private then that's fine but it's
it's like it when you hashtag things if
your profile is private then you're not
going to they're not going to go into
the hashtag area and we're not gonna be
able to see it if you tagged us so and
we want to see yeah we want to see like
what you guys like sometimes you
probably this is so cute you have to see
it I'm like I can't so follow us and
then you guys
can actually tag us and we can check
each other out okay okay guys look at
this
it is actually a hundred and six degrees
the car was right okay I think we're
actually gonna get in now are you
getting in are you ready my she's
actually gonna get into the water
I clearly ahead jump in come on just
jump in I can't jump in come on are you
telling me you can't do a backflip into
the pool I think that's reasonable
okay I can't wow I feel so good babe
Cassie can do eight flips in a row okay
do eight flips cause Jimmy says he can
do more 9 foot 9 foot the flips to beat
Jimmy can you do it
you are the circle of two people

criminal again I'm going through
everyone's stuff here I'm gonna stand up
I thought that just leaving the pool and
I felt so nice in there my ribs have
been killing me for the past couple of
days and we really had it had time to
like go swimming and it's so nice to
like feel that weightless feeling when
you're swimming because sometimes you
just need it but now we're actually
headed over to my aunt's house because
that's we actually swim at her pool and
my cousin actually just had a baby she's
probably about a week old so we still
haven't seen her yet so I'm really
excited to meet her baby this is little
