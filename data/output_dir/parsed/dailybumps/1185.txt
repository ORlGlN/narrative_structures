meaning of Christmas yes there you go
gotta be one I kind of thank you and you
can just look at it oh this helps maybe
you care I write you guys I am here with
Chris who is the owner of this beautiful
place tell me a little about what you're
doing here well we decided about 25
years ago that we had a talent for
putting together those little villages
maybe not a talent but at least a
passion I would say so yeah and so we
actually won a contest a nationwide
contest for people to decorate with
these houses and some a club of people
that do these kinds of things up in LA
came to our house unbeknownst to us I
was on a night that we had a regular
party uh-huh and I thought they were
from Mary's office and Mary thought they
were from my office and after a couple
hours we realized that neither one of us
knew them you said like random people
walk into your house and we and when
they they were apologetic and they said
we're sorry we leave we'll leave listen
oh how cool is that the people we don't
even know would like to get them come
look at what we do yeah so that was the
start that was it is this Mary I'm
yeah let's call Merry Christmas because
it's my wife marrying I'm Chris and my
two boys are always a mess that's why
we're Merry Christmas
hey this is a beautiful thing you guys
are doing here though and we've always
heard about it we've never been so we
just want to show it off we're so glad
you did thank you find yourself a toy oh
yeah put him right there do you see
Mickey oh gosh I got all the stuffed
animals now give up eggnog
Kim aha golly thank you he's trying his
first candy cane today and he seems to
love it
anything's at this draw bear it fan it
away that helps oh it's coming our way
it's coming our way
check out this bonfire you guys it feels
so nice Holly and I are just cuddling
right in front of the fire Holly you're
enjoying yourself - huh if she is our
he's just like looking around everywhere
I love to go into that house you guys
and I think it's because it was such a
good example of the true meaning of
Christmas and I know around this time of
the year you know everyone really gets
caught up in presents and lights and
decoration and all that is really great
but Christmas is really just about
celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ
and what better way to do that than to
lead by example you know of what Christ
would do and just those people welcoming
everyone into their home feeding them
they had a soup and they had like
sausages and he was cooking up like all
the time and people are going in and
grabbing crackers and cookies and food
they just want people to come and share
the joy Christmas with them and give and
don't ask for anything in return and not
to mention they're also you know raising
funds and raising canned goods for the
local area and I think that's just
amazing that's what it's about you guys
it's about living your life in the
example of Jesus and I think that was
just a really great thing so I'm really
glad we went and did that I hope you
guys enjoyed it too I am going to go
ahead and end to the
Blagh we had a busy day we got a lot of
stuff done but I hope you guys enjoyed
today's video if you did give it a
thumbs up and we'll see you guys
tomorrow for another fun-filled day hi
guys
