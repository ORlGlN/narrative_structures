nothing like a little morning swim to
brighten your day Holly loves the hippo
is he starting to move his hands even
this is our son baby
there's a boy he's gonna do amazing
things
having so much fun this morning you guys
had no Sun and it was such fun I'm
actually kind of bummed / excited
because we just switched him to private
lessons so this was actually his last
guppy class which I'm really sad about I
love going in there and swimming at them
it's like a little like fun time he gets
to see all the other babies and so now
it's serious yeah he's gonna be going
with the same teacher so he gets to stay
with her which we just like love her she
think we I just think she's awesome and
she's really good with Oliver and Oliver
thinks she's awesome so we're staying
with her but I won't be getting in the
water anymore and it'll just be him in
her one-on-one excited for him because I
bet he'll probably progress a little bit
more just because it's kind of hard for
me to teach him everything and not like
I don't know I'm just his mom and I feel
like a teacher can teach him better than
I can
this he's being a rebel she doesn't want
to walk with me she's walking straight
are you seriously gonna go all the way
over there she's crazy you guys
oh yeah it's like diagonally now your
knock is you're in a crosswalk it's
probably our favorite shopping place
because it has two bar favorite places
which is byebye baby which we're going

we're definitely going to because I've
had a burrito in like a week you guys
and I'm starving

Ollie has a little crib guard on that
side well we need two side ones
apparently right she does want to make
it so anything we're gonna buy this one
and then she's just you can sew the
fabric that you have onto it right
because we've been just like wrapping it
around and he just unwrapped it and
choose who's on it yeah so now it's not
even a guard it's more like just cover
