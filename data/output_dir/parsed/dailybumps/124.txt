We have one final question From Shannon,
"What's the one thing you really want
"for Christmas this year?"
Okay boys, so this is your chance,
you can tell Santa
through the YouTube video,
what do you want for Christmas?
("Tribe" by Daily Bumps)
-  Good morning.
We just got back home and this
little buddy ran up to us,
and gave us both the biggest hugs ever.
Did you have fun with Mimi and Papa?
Yes.
Yeah?
We just got back from our trip,
so we're excited to see all of them.
Mimi, Papa.
Yeah.
Cover Batman cup, go,
go, go, go, go, home.
Ollie.
-  Hey what's up dude?
Hi Ollie.
-  Give Daddy a hug.
Oh hey, remember me?
(laughs) Did you have fun?
Yeah.
Yes, I missed you.
I missed you too.
Aw gimme a big hug.
(growls)
Now you can have lots more fun
now that Mama and Dada are home, k?
Yeah.
You guys it is so nice to be home
and it's actually kind
of a warm day today.
We've been having a lot of cool weather
the past couple weeks, and kind of warm.
But I'm gonna toss out some baby arugula
that we had in the fridge
leftover from I think pizza night
to my little chickies.
And all I have are hens left guys,
if you don't know I had to get
rid of a few of my roosters,
I'll have that video linked up here.
It was kind of sad,
but I know that they'll be
happy where they're going.
And they're going to a nice place,
no one's gonna eat them or
anything, so that's good.
Yeah I just thought I'd toss
out some arugula for them.
One, two, three, four, that's five.
There's Moana, six, and seven.
That's Ursula, and this is all
the chickens I have you guys.
This is it, seven chickens
plus that one in there.
That's not very many chickens,
I might end up having to
buy some more chickens.
I'm just trying to debate,
do I wanna do them from like eggs, chicks?
Or just get hens that are already laying?
Cuz really I'm only getting like
two or three eggs right now,
because not all of my chickens are
high-production egg layers.
I'm like do I want more eggs?
Because if I want that then
I can just buy grown hens
that are already laying
and maybe that are good layers.
So that's what I'm kinda
debating right now.
But I do love raising them as chicks,
when they're little babies,
I think that is like
the sweetest thing ever.
Let's see how many eggs I got now.
Oh there's two.
Just two eggs, that's it.
There they all are.
Oh, that one's kind of a meanie.
Ollie are you wearing Olivia's shirt?
Yeah.
(laughs) He's wearing Liv's shirt.
She must have left it here
one time when she slept over,
it's so funny.
Hey now that Mommy and Daddy are here,
you can do crazy stuff right?
Yeah.
Oh no what are you doing on the table?
Whoa.
(laughs)
-  Let's do that again.
Let's do that again.
Here we go.
Whoa, oh my gosh that was crazy.
Ollie could you go higher?
Watch this.
-  Okay.
Whoa you did a spin?
Yeah.
Whoa, do another one like a Superman.
Go, whoa that was such a good Superman.
You're so good at this dude.
He's just going nonstop now,
it's just getting crazy up in here.
Whoa, on your back?
Where did you learn all those tricks?
From Papa.
Come here, you're so funny dude.
You always have so much energy, huh?
(upbeat instrumental music)
Alright Missy, what is going on
in our kitchen right now?
We have some huge boxes laid out
and a ton of groceries.
What are we doing?
Yeah so basically we are
gonna help provide Thanksgiving
dinners to some people
who are in need through our community.
So we have these boxes,
and we're gonna basically
just gonna fill them up
with all kinds of groceries.
And I used this super easy Instacart
to just literally order everything,
and it was just delivered.
Now I'm just gonna separate
all into the boxes.
Yes, so this is a local
outreach initiative,
done by our church.
They had all these boxes prepared for us,
and then they gave all of us a
shopping list of what to shop
and fill them with.
Now we get to pack 'em up.
Yeah okay, so each family
gets four boxes of Stove Top Stuffing,
which I think is awesome
cuz that stuff is delicious.
Mom we need three cans of corn.
Alright, one, two, three.
Put 'em in there.
Okay.
(laughs) Can you do it?
No.
-  (laughs) Wrong
box, but that's okay.
I'll just set 'em on the counter,
and you can put 'em in there.
We need three cans of green beans.
-  Three cans, alright, hang on.
-  Searching through
all these groceries,
look at this.
-  Set 'em in there.
(upbeat instrumental music)
Ollie isn't this so cool?
Yeah.
We're gonna put all this food in a box,
and then guess what?
We're gonna give this box to
someone who is struggling,
so that they can have a
nice Thanksgiving dinner.
Isn't that nice?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Think that's a cool thing to do,
to provide for people right?
Oh look we have sweet potatoes.
-  Go ahead and put
the sweet potatoes in there.
-  We need one giant
can of sweet potatoes.
(Ollie yells)
(Bryan laughs)
Mama don't forget the cranberry sauce.
-  Yes, you gotta have
cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving.
-  We've got whole cranberries
and jelled cranberry sauce.
-  Yes, cuz some people like both.
I prefer the real stuff,
but the jelly stuff is kind of iconic.
-  Mom we need marshmallows.
-  You got it.
(screaming)
(laughs)
They're having so much fun
packing these Thanksgiving boxes.
I wanted to ask you guys though,
which one do you prefer?
Canned cranberry sauce
or jelly cranberry sauce?
I'm gonna have a poll in the iCard above
so that you can select,
but also let us know down
below in the comments below.
Do you like real cranberry sauce or jelly?
I definitely prefer the real stuff.
Hey Ollie what kind of
cranberry sauce do you like?
I don't like cranberry sauce.
-  Alright they need gravy.
Gravy.
-  Let's put it in.
Tatoes.
-  And then we're
also throwing in cereal
and peanut butter because
the local outreach
always needs lots of
cereal and peanut butter.
So that's a good thing
to throw in there too.
So this box is basically fully packaged,
except we also gonna put a
little $20 check in there,
so that they can get
their turkey, their pie,
and their rolls.
-  Yeah.
What do you think dude?
Is that a lot of yummy
food for Thanksgiving?
Yep, I Thanksgiving.
Can't wait for Thanksgiving.
It's gonna be so much fun, huh?
Alright, let's pack up
the rest of these boxes.
(upbeat instrumental music)
Alright, while Ollie and
Missy work diligently
to pack these Thanksgiving boxes.
I thought we could also do another
Ask Daily Bumps at the same time.
So we asked you guys on Twitter
to send us some questions,
and we're gonna answer
some of them right now.
Alright Ollie Madeline asked,
"What are you gonna do if the Grinch comes
"to your house again?"
(Ollie gasps)
Do you remember that?
Oh, he's obviously gonna hide,
because he is very afraid of the Grinch.
Hey Ollie, it's okay you
don't need to be scared.
If you guys don't remember,
last year the Grinch came to the house
and some hilarious stuff went down.
Here's what you missed.
(mischievous instrumental music)
Hey Mama I'm ready for the next one.
-  Alright lemme
just find this last corn.
-  You need corn?
-  We don't need corn.
-  We need corn.
You're doing so good packing these buddy,
I'm so proud of you.
(Ollie mumbles)
Selma asked,
"What are you most excited
about for Thanksgiving?"
I am excited about spending
quality time with my friends,
with my family, and turkey sandwiches.
You excited about for Thanksgiving?
Hanging out with all of my
family and of course food.
-  Yeah, Ollie,
what are you excited
about for Thanksgiving?
I'm excited about Thanksgiving
is about my doggies.
(laughs)
-  Wait, what did he say?
My doggies, what?
Wait did you say you're excited
to learn what Thanksgiving is about?
Yeah.
Okay we'll teach you this year okay?
Thanksgiving.
Thanksgiving.
Alright, put those green beans in.
We got green beans that need
to be loaded into those boxes.
Minty Trouble asked,
"What is your favorite thing
to eat on Thanksgiving?"
Honestly probably, and this is gonna sound
really, really, weird; Stove Top stuffing.
I love Stove Top stuffing.
What's your favorite thing
to eat on Thanksgiving babe?
Apple pie.
-  Ooh good one.
Whoa, Finn is zipping around on this.
He is so fast you guys.
I'm trying to catch up with him,
because I'm trying to ask him.
Finn, what is your favorite
thing to eat at Thanksgiving?
(laughs) I can't get him to answer.
Hey Finn what's your favorite
thing to eat at Thanksgiving?
Food.
-  Food, yeah, food's pretty yummy.
Okay bye, Finn is so funny.
He seriously just wants to be independent
and ride his bike while we
pack our Thanksgiving boxes inside.
Daily Bump's Tribe asked,
"What's your favorite Christmas movie?"
Hers is The Grinch.
What is our favorite Christmas movie?
You know my Christmas movie?
-  What?
Nightmare Before Christmas.
-  Oh that's a good one.
Babe we all know yours.
Elf.
Elf of course.
Missy actually asked if we're
going to decorate outside.
We have such a huge yard,
we should at least put
a blow-up or something.
I definitely wanna decorate.
-  Do like a blow-up Santa?
Hopefully this year we can.
-  Okay, look at
Ollie putting all the gravy.
Uh oh, make sure that box only gets two,
there you go.
Here we go marshmallows.
(Ollie yells)
-  Marshmallows.
Where do I put this?
In the second one.
It's right there, no, no.
Is this one?
-  That one.
-  There you go.
Alright, go to the next box.
(laughs) Stop.
-  Nope, the next one.
-  Now this one
Ollie, right here (laughs).
Ready, get it.
Go to the next.
In this one?
Yeah this one.
Yeah any one that doesn't have it.
Alright catch it!
Put it in the box.
(upbeat instrumental music)
Hey Ollie, Grace wants to know
what your favorite ice cream flavor is?
My favorite is cherry and strawberry.
Cherry strawberry, there you go.
Oh hey Finn.
Waka, waka, waka, waka, waka, waka.
-  We're putting
together Thanksgiving boxes,
what are you doing?
Hey Ollie, all the peanut
butter has to go in the boxes.
-  Peanut butter, my favorite.
-  Alright, we have Finn
into the mix helping pack these boxes.
Alright babe, Icicle Pop wants to know,
do we have any holiday
traditions with our family?
Yes we have a lot of traditions.
One is that every year we
write a Christmas letter
and we read it the next year.
-  Yeah kinda like
a time capsule thing.
And I also love when we
all get matching pajamas.
Do you like when we do that?
Yeah.
(kisses)
Are you helping me?
-  I don't know if he's helping
or just pulling things out
of boxes at this point.
Put the peanut butter in that one.
Alright Sophie asked do we
like giving or receiving gifts?
And I think it's pretty clear
for what Missy's doing right now even.
I love giving.
I love that way more than receiving.
Yeah, she's so funny and
frugal with ourselves.
And then when it comes to
other people and giving
she's like, "Give 'em whatever they want."
Missy's got such a sweet heart
and we love that about Mama.
(growls)
Finn, look at all this yummy food.
Doesn't it look so yummy?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're gonna give this to someone
so that they can have Thanksgiving.
Cool, huh?
Alright boys, now that we have
all the Thanksgiving boxes packed,
we have one final question
from Shannon who asks,
"What's the one thing you really want
for Christmas this year?"
Okay boys, so this is your chance.
you can tell Santa
through the YouTube video,
what do you want for Christmas?
I want is a special dinosaur
that is a Power Ranger.
Okay, that's the one thing you want?
Okay Finn, what do you want for Christmas?
Halloween.
You want it to be Halloween again?
Yeah.
(laughing) That is probably
the strangest Christmas wish
I've ever heard (laughing).
You're so cute Finn.
I love you guys.
Alright, thank you for helping pack
the Thanksgiving boxes.
Ollie you did so good dude.
I'm so proud of you.
(upbeat music)
-  Ollie, who's
here playing with you?
Pay and Liv.
-  Yeah, Pay and
Liv came over to visit.
What's up girls?
What are we doing?
I'm making Play-doh.
We got a Play-doh set
for them to dig into.
They're all enjoying it.
Ollie's been begging for
Liv and Pay to come over,
so that they can hang out.
You guys work together really well, huh?
What are you making Ollie?
I'm making a kitty cat
cuz I love kitty cats.
-  Oh, that is a kitty cat
Finn's in charge of all
the shapes and cutouts.
What are you doing?
I'm making an alligator.
-  Oh, that's so cool.
Do you see that Ollie, with green?
-  Yeah.
She's making an alligator, nice.
(cheerful instrumental music)
Alright you guys, Missy
is reading a bedtime story
to the boys right now.
I'm gonna go in and
show you what happened,
something hilarious and funny,
but you guys gotta be quiet okay?
This book knocks them out every time.
This has never happened.
-  This has never happened.
They've never fallen
asleep in the same bed.
-  Do we leave 'em?
I was thinking about it,
but I think Finn would fall off.
-  Oh yeah, that's so cute.
-  They're so cute.
K, nite, nite boys.
