- We are out of the house because
we have a ton of errands
to we need to run today.
And one of them is...
(whispers) buying Finn a birthday present.
- We are at the haunted maze!
- Is this your first haunted maze ever?
- Yes.
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.
- Are you scared?
- Um, yeah...
- Yeah, just a little bit?
We'll see how it turns out. (laughs)
♫ This is our life
♫ This is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream
♫ This is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
- Good morning!
- Morning!
(Finn babbling)
(laughs)
- Yay, it's Saturday morning.
Huh?
- Yeah.
- It has been a crazy week you guys.
I actually cried a few
times last week because
we were just so swamped, and so busy.
And it's finally Saturday.
And we're still busy,
I still have a party
tomorrow (laughs) actually.
But I feel like I'm
pretty much ready for it,
and I'm excited for it.
So there is stuff I
have to get done today,
like cleaning up...and stuff.
But we have been, just running
like crazy this past week.
The house is kind of insane,
especially this area.
I've been trying to
clean it up this morning,
but, yeah, I really like my sewing stuff
it's just a disaster.
I bought this probably
before Ollie was born,
because I was doing a lot of sewing.
And it is just torn apart,
and nothing is organized
in here and it is just
a disaster. (laughs)
So I was like, alright,
I'm going to go through it.
I'm going to get my bag out...
start throwing away things you don't need.
I feel like sewing boxes and, just like,
craft areas tend to get very messy.
Because you just keep like
little scraps, you're like,
"Oh, well I'm not going to throw this away
because I can probably
use it for something."
Which is true, but then it
just becomes so unorganized,
and I'm like "I can't do it anymore!"
Which makes crafting not
fun when it's not organized.
So anyways, I've got to clean up today.
We've got actually a lot
of fun stuff planned today.
- Alright you guys, we
are out of the house
because we have a ton of
errands we need to run today.
And one of them is...
(whispers) Buying Finn a birthday present.
So, we have to...
(Missy laughs)
get rid of Finn.
- (laughs) Get rid of him.
- We have to drop Finn off
over at Mimi and Papa's house,
he's going to hang out with them today.
And then we are going to
go find a birthday present.
Alright Finn, what you got?
- Me!
-  What you got, a sucker?
- Yeah!
-  Yeah? You ready
to go see Mimi and Papa?
-  I've got a red a
sucker, red's my favorite
- I have green.
-  And you've got green!
Yup, he's got a red sucker,
Finn's got a green one.
Alright, come on Finn.
Alright! Dropping Finn off,
over at Mimi and Papa's house.
He's got all the pets to play with
-  Hey, oh my goodness
(upbeat music)
-  Dude, look,
it's actually Bricktober.
Did you know that?
- Yeah, that's Cotton,
comes with two swords...
I did not know that.
He would really like these...
These are Spider-man guns.
Oh my gosh! Iron Man, it comes with guns!
- Alright Ollie, you have a very important
decision to make, okay?
- Okay.
- You have to choose a birthday present
for your little brother,
who is turning two.
-  Yes.
- He's turning two in just
a couple of days, okay?
- Let's do this.
(energetic, bouncy music)
-  What do you think Ollie?
Should we get him a dinosaur?
- Um, yeah. Let's get him this one.
-  Whoa, that looks
way too complicated for Finn.
- Yeah, it comes with a
cage and a Rhoetosaurus.
- Hey Ollie, are you sure you're not
picking out a present for yourself?
- Um, no.
- And not Finn...okay.
(Bryan laughs)
 Look it.
- Just so we can share with Finn
-  Oh, okay.
-  Look at this, a dragon one.
-  Ooh, it's remote
controlled too, that's cool.
(dragon roars)
-  We can't...
-  No, we can't get that for him?
(upbeat music)
- Wow, it's with two guns!
-  That looks cool! That
could be something he likes.
He definitely loves Batman.
- Dada, I found a pirate ship,
and it comes with this guy, and a cannon-
-  Whoa! Who's that guy, Ollie?
Where did you see him?
- This is Jack...
Jack Sparrow!
-  And?
- He came to my birthday party...
And there's a shark, and a cannon.
-  Yeah, that's Jack Sparrow,
he was at your birthday party, huh?
- Yeah, and goes into the pirate ship.
-  That's a pretty cool ship.
- We picked out a present!
- We did, we picked out
a present for Finn, huh?
- Yeah.
- And if you want to see what we got him,
you'll have to watch tomorrow's vlog,
because tomorrow we're having
a big birthday party for Finn.
Hey! Are you excited for
Finn's birthday party?
Yeah? (Bryan laughs)
- I like this and--
-  Yes, I know you like it all,
but that's the point of a
toy store, Ollie. (laughs)
He's been such a good
boy, but he has been like,
"Ooh I like that, ooh I
like that, ooh I like that!"
Like yes, I know, he's
kind of dropping hints
for Santa, I think too.
Alright--
- Whoa!
-  Whoa! Do you
have fun shopping? (laughs)
- Look at this.
-  Alright, we just got
back from shopping for Finn.
Ollie is fast asleep.
-  And so is Finn.
-  Hey dude,
you want some blankie?
(whispers) There you go buddy.
Alright, so we got some errands done,
the kids are asleep.
And we even... are doing some testing
for our Halloween party.
I really want to serve empanadas at the
Halloween party this year,
so we got these ones.
Ooh, we don't know what
any of them are. (laughs)
Do you like it?
- Mm, not bad I just
don't know what it is.
-  We have ham and cheese, beef,
and chicken and cilantro too.
Alright, let me know if you guys
have ever had empanadas before.
We are taste testing them,
and they are super good.
It's a Cuban food, basically.
And it comes with Mojo sauce,
which is like a garlic sauce?
Do you think we should serve
these at the Halloween party?
-  I like how
easy they are, you just--
-  I know! No, totally.
If you guys have eaten empanadas,
let us know in the comments down below,
what is your favorite type of empanada?
What should we be looking out for?
This one's called The
Oscar, it's got ham, cheese,
and like some sort of other Cuban meat.
I'm not sure.
Oh hey dude!
Good morning Finn.
-  Did you have a nice nap?
(Bryan laughs)
- Hey dude, it's good you
guys got a little nap,
because we're going somewhere fun.
Yeah, we are going to be
out kind of late today,
because we are going to take
the boys to a haunted maze.
So, Ollie definitely needed a little nap.
I'm glad Finn got a good one too!
Whoa! Your feet are flashing! Do it again!
Whoa! Now they're green.
Whoa, those are some dance moves bro.
(Bryan laughs)
Alright Ollie, where
are we going right now?
- We are at the haunted maze!
- Is this your first haunted maze ever?
- Yes.
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.
- Are you scared?
- Um, yeah.
- Yeah, just a little bit?
Yes, we are headed into...
Ollie's very first haunted maze.
We'll see how it turns out. (laughs)
(melodious music)
- Alright, the boys are off.
Woooo....
-  Oh my goodness, it's a clown!
(clown honks)
Such a funny clown.
-  Hi clown! (laughs)
Finn high-fived him.
We gotta find the keys, in the Orbeez.
Ollie, can you find
the keys in the Orbeez?
- Mmhmm.
(cow bell clanking)
-  Okay let's go find the key.
-  Yeah.
-  Whoa! Look at this clown.
(laughs)
So far they're doing really good.
What do you boys think so far?
- Creepy!
-  Whoa! Hey!
Alright, we gotta find a key, right?
- Yeah.
-  Alright, we
gotta find a key, boys!
Can you find a key in one of these holes?
Whoa!
- No.
-  No in there?
Try the other one, try the other one!
We have to find a key in the Orbeez
to get out of here.
-  There's probably no key.
They're just making you--
-  That's what's scary.
(upbeat music)
Alright Ollie, what did you think
of your very first haunted maze?
(whines)
You look a little scared, are you afraid?
You don't need to be afraid (laughs)
It was actually really cute,
we were just like walking between lights-
- That was so cute!
- And hay and stuff
He did so good!
You are so brave, dude.
Show me your brave muscles!
(Missy laughs)
Can you give me muscles?
No? Aww.
- Aww.
- He's so sad, it's okay buddy.
-  You did so good.
Those were like really nice clowns,
and it was basically just a game.
-  The scary
clowns are in that one--
- Yeah everything's scary--
-  And we're not gonna go in there.
- I'm going to go into that one,
and I'm gonna say, "Hey!
You leave Ollie alone."
Okay?
-  You don't go in that one, okay?
- And you'll be good.
You can hang out here,
and eat some popcorn.
Finn! Were you afraid?
Did you find the key?
- So, the haunted maze is
actually being held at a dairy.
And it is one of the best dairy's,
in like Southern California.
Everyone raves about the chocolate milk.
- And Ollie's the chocolate
milk professional.
(Missy laughs)
-  Yeah! Um, I
want one of those too.
- You have to tell me
what you think, okay?
- It's like chocolate
milk with whole milk,
it's very good.
- Um, we should all share this one.
This is like 1000 calories.
-  Oh, you're right. (laughs)
It's, uh, very, very famous out here,
and everyone loves DeJong's Dairy,
because they have chocolate milk.
Alright, look who's joined us!
- Hey! Actually, this is
like my worst nightmare.
- Now we're really going to get scared.
(everyone laughs)
I don't want to go.
- So a lot of the stuff
being used in this maze
is actually from our last maze,
that we had last year.
So we're really excited
to check it out here.
It's inside a abandoned
warehouse apparently
- Oh, that's so cool.
(missy laughs)
- Well I think it's going to
be really fun, so let's go!
Alright, here we go.
(ominous music)
(Missy screams)
-  Ooh, a hand!
(Missy laughs)
(Bryan yells)
(screams)
-  Oh, no no no no.
- It says to keep out!
-  Boo!
(laughter)
Play with me!
-  Oh my God, I remember that mask!
(Missy screams)
I remember this mask.
You guys need help with that?
You're supposed to bang it!
(banging)
-  No, it's not working.
We are trying to watch Teen Mother.
(laughter)
-  Oh my God.
-  They're watching Teen Mom.
(Missy screams)
-  Oh yeah, I
remember we bought that!
(laughs) I remember him!
(screams)
Oh wow.
-  This is really dark and scary.
-  It is pitch dark in here.
We made it, we made it through!
Good maze.
- You like it?
-  Yeah, it was good!
- Okay good, bye.
(Missy laughs)
- That was such a fun maze!
It was fun seeing it and it's pretty cool
how so many people came
out to experience it too.
-  This is a really scary
scene of the block right now.
-  Yeah! I'm
like, um, we're doing--
-  (scary voice)
You have no idea...
what lurks in the frame.
- This is the scariest part
of the night, right now.
-  Karma! (whistles)
-  (laughs) Hi boy.
-  Oh hi.
-  Did you turn the
handle and just walk in the door?
Is that what you just did?
If you don't know, Karma has recently
learned how to turn handles.
As long as they're the long handles,
turn it and push the door open.
He's done it in the bathroom.
He's done it from the backdoor,
which is really heavy, and
he pushes on it so hard.
It's actually really naughty,
but it's actually kind of adorable.
- And Luna's done it from the front door.
- Yeah, she's done it
from the front door...
Karma taught her. And Karma
knows how to close doors too.
He'll close the door to the bathroom if he
gets annoyed, or if we get mad at him,
he'll just be like, "Fine!",
and run to the bathroom
and slam the door shut. It's hilarious.
But anyways, it is so late you guys.
Ollie had a really hard
time falling asleep.
He came out here...
(whispers) and fell asleep like this.
(laughs)
Alright, oh my goodness.
(laughs) Good night.
I don't know, I guess
he had such a busy day,
but maybe he was just over-tired.
He just came out here, and couldn't sleep,
so he laid on the couch and
that's how he passed out.
(laughs)
He put himself under there even.
Anyways, it's time for him to go to bed.
We are setting up for Finn's
birthday party right now.
So I'm very, very excited about that.
- So excited for Finn's birthday!
- Yay, it's going to be so fun.
- Don't miss tomorrow's vlog.
- Yes, it's gonna be awesome.
So, I've been setting up
a little bit for that.
-  Ollie say night-night.
-  Ollie say night-night. (laughs)
But anyways, make sure you give this video
a big thumbs up!
We had such a fun day,
the boys really enjoyed their very first
haunted maze.
But we will see you guys tomorrow.
Karma, can you say bye, boop?
Ready? Bye...
boop!
(upbeat music)
