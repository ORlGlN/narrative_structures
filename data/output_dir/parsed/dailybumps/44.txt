-  What are you doin'?
Oh my gosh, are you allowed to do that?
-  Oh my gosh.
(laughing)

-  Good morning!
- How are you this morning, bud?
- Good.
- Bryan's getting work
done in the office, huh?
And mommy and daddy are goin'
somewhere really special today
and we're really looking forward to it.
It's got something to do with you.
- Really?
- Mhm.
(babbling)
He wanted to redo his morning,
'cause he was a little grumpy huh?
Are you having a good morning?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
He's so funny.
He's like, wait, I need
to redo my morning.
- Oh hey Finn.
- Hey.
- Finn, you got it easy.
We're not talking to your
teacher today, are we?
- No.
- No.
We're talking to your teacher.
Did you know that Ollie?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- We are doing a parent-teacher
conference today.
- It's his first
parent-teacher conference.
He's not coming, right?
-  Mm, mm.
- So, it's just Missy and I.
You're teacher's gonna tell
us how good you've been.
- Really?
-  Yeah, oh, see a
little worry in those eyes.
-  He's like hmmm.
-  Are you afraid
that your teacher's
gonna tell us somethin' that
you don't want us to hear?
- Un-hun.
- No?
'Cause you've been a good boy?
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, parent-teacher conferences
aren't something you really
need to worry about when
you're in preschool probably.
She's probably just gonna say
he's the best little boy ever.
All right, go have fun with Mimi and Papa.
We're dropping the boys off
at Mimi and Papa's house,
so that we can go do that.
Finn, do you like my Star Wars shirt?
- Yeah!
- Isn't that so cool?
They're fighting with the lightsabers.
Isn't that neat?
- Yeah.
- All right, we are so excited
for Ollie's parent-teacher conference,
'cause we actually haven't
had a chance to talk
with his teacher to see
how she feels he's doing,
and I think this will
also give us a good idea
if he'll be ready for
kindergarten which is next year.
I cannot believe our kid is going
into kindergarten next year.
- Yeah, we'll see about that.
- Yeah, we'll see about that.
But yeah, I think we'll
get a good idea of like,
you know what she feels,
how he's progressing,
what he's doing.
I think he's doing great, but
he's definitely a preschooler,
and he just wants to have fun still.
(upbeat music)
-  Missy holds in her hand Oliver's
very first report card grade.
- Yeah!
-  How crazy is that?
- It's really crazy, like, he's old enough
to have a report card.
(laughing)
- His teacher basically
looked at all these things
on this report card,
and graded him on them.
I think this is the first time as a parent
that this is something
that's really happened,
and we got to sit down with his teacher
and learn so much about him.
It was really kind of
incredible as a parent.
-  Yeah.
- I think to get to that point,
you know in your parenting.
- Yeah, 'cause like, as a
parent, like you know your kid.
You know all that, but
when you get to kinda get
the perspective of someone
who also loves him,
but that they're not necessarily a parent,
is really, really, really
cool and very interesting, so.
- Yeah, so we just wrapped
up lunch, and we are headed
back to Mimi and Papa's to grab the boys.
We can talk to Oliver about
his first report card.
- Yeah.
(laughing)
-  All right, Ollie.
Mommy and Daddy just got back
from our parent-teacher conference,
and we have your very first report card.
Did you know that?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
So, we talked to Miss Tracy today,
that's your teacher, right?
- Mhm.
- Okay good, we talked to the right one.
And she gave me all this
information about you.
Look at all this.
You see that?
And you know what she said?
- What?
- She said that you are
so fun to have in class,
that she absolutely loves you.
She says that you have
gotten so confident,
and you're getting so much better.
Do you like going over
with her and working
on your letters and numbers?
- Yeah.
- Is she like the nicest teacher ever?
It sounds like she really
has really poured a lot
of like attention into him to kinda like.
-  Yeah.
- Like just make him super confident.
Well, it sounds like
you're getting really good
at your numbers, huh?
-  Super proud of you, dude.
- Yeah, and you're learning
all the kids' names.
- She said that when school
starts, if certain kids
aren't there yet, Ollie will say like,
"Well, so-and-so's not here."
And Ollie knows their
names; whereas other kids
don't really pay attention to that.
- Wait that kid.
Where's that one kid?
And, I'm like, that's so cute
that you know their names huh?
It just sounds like you're doing
such a great job in preschool.
Do you like preschool?
- So proud of you.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
I'm just so proud of you.
- We're both so proud of you.
- So smart and you're learning so much.
And it's really cool.
- So, Miss Tracy also said
that Oliver connects a lot more
with numbers or recognizes
numbers versus letters,
and that was something that
I did a lot of in school.
I always connected more
with like math and science,
and she said that you're really interested
in math and science, too, huh?
- Yeah.
- So maybe this summer,
Papa we could put together
some cool science experiments with Ollie?
Would that be fun?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he's also like really
good at like patterns and.
- Like creating his own patterns?
- Yeah, like he's really good at like
creating his own patterns
and just kinda like,
if she says like it's blue, blue, yellow,
he'll keep doing blue, blue, yellow.
So, that's really cool.
It's really good at that age, so yay!
I'm hanging out in my parents' backyard
which is still just dirt.
So sad.
But we, we really wanted to start, like,
kinda changing it up,
and making it look nicer.
They have a really big backyard
but definitely mostly dirt.
Cassie really needs
some concrete back here,
so she can ride her tricycle.
- It'd be really nice to
not be driving it on dirt.
-  All right, show me
how you ride the tricycle.
This is the cutest tricycle ever.
Can you do it?
- No.
- No, doggy Kota.
Go, Finn, go!
Aw, your feet are not
quite big enough, huh?
But yeah, so my mom still needs to, like,
do the backyard and then
there's one other area
that people are always
talking about or asking about.
I'm gonna show you right now.
And it's this room.
It's super duper empty.
No, it's not empty on purpose.
It's just that it's a big project,
and we gotta figure out, like,
what they all want in here.
What do you think you want in here, Mom?
- Well, I know for sure we wanna do
maybe a dining area right here.
-  Yeah, not that.
(inaudible chatter)
- And then we're kinda
thinking maybe a library.
-  Yeah.
- So, like bookshelves
and a little seating.
-  Mhm.
- This room has overwhelmed
me just because.
-  It's so big.
- It's the last room I wanted to get done,
because it's the last
room I know we'll use.
-  Yeah.
Oh my goodness, what are you doing?
Finley!
(laughing)
-  He's like where is it?
-  What are you doin?
Oh my gosh, are you allowed to do that?
He's just looking at me.
What do you say?
-  Oh my gosh.
-  Bye.
What are you doing?
-  He's vacuuming the floor.
- Oh my gosh, that is, what
do you think of this, Mom?
- It kind of stresses me out.
Bit of an expensive toy.
-  Yeah, it is.
(laughing)
-  Papa taught him
how, so I can't get mad.
-  Yeah, you can get mad at Papa.
No, poor Ollie can't do it, huh?
You're too big.
I can't believe that.
That's hilarious.
(upbeat techno music)
-  It's time for some juice.
We need a little juice pick-me-up,
so Mimi is hooking it up.
- I'm out of pineapple but I still have
some strawberries and some apples.
-  That is crazy.
- Ready Ollie, you wanna help?
-  Ooh, you wanna make some juice?
- Yeah.
-  All right, makin'
juice at Mimi and Papa's house.
- Start grabbin' stuff.
Put it in.
-  Throw a
strawberry in there, nice.
- Put more oranges and apples in there.
-  Whoa!
Ollie did you know this
is how juice gets made?
- Really?
-  Yeah.
(upbeat music)
And then, there was juice.
That's crazy.
- I want one.
-  You want one?
- Yeah.
-  Looks yummy, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Wow, that looks so good.
-  And the chickens love that.
-  Oh yeah, that's awesome.
-  That's crazy.
- All right, Ollie, will
you try yours with me?
- Yeah.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
-  How is it?
- Good.
- Oh wow, that is gnarly.
That's so yummy.
-  It's smooth isn't it?
- Yeah.
- That's good.
-  And it's good for you, huh?
'Cause it's just fruit.
Try it Finn, what do you think?
Well, is it good?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
-  Can you and Ollie cheers?
Cheers!
- Watch this, Mama.
-  Okay.
Are you watering the plants?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
He's been out here helping me
water all our house plants.
I got 'em all in this little
wagon, and we watered 'em all.
And now they're just getting some sun.
I basically taught him today
that plants are living,
and so I said you have
to be gentle with them.
And so he's like walking
around like, "Hi, plant."
Or, "Are you okay?"
-  That's so cute.
-  These ones are yellow,
'cause they need more water, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, see these
ones that are green?
They got more water than these guys.
-  Cool, so you're
givin' lots to drink?
- Yep.
-  Yeah, I showed the plants, like,
the water going in 'em, like
getting sucked up by the plant.
- Oh cool.
-  He's like, "They're drinking!"
That one needs more water?
Awesome.
Thanks for helping me water
all our plants, buddy.
- You're welcome.
-  Oh, look at these, Ollie.
We're gettin' some flowers.
-  I know, I watered them.
-  You did water them?
That's probably why we're getting flowers,
'cause you watered them.
Oh, that's awesome.
Water this one.
Yeah, good job dude.
(upbeat music)
- All right, we are
gettin' ready for bed now.
Did you have a good
day with Mimi and Papa?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you drank all that yummy juice.
- Uh-huh.
- We had such an awesome day.
It was so fun getting
to talk to his teacher,
and just kind of talk all about Ollie
and how awesome he is.
Finn, did you have a good day?
- Yeah!
- Yeah?
All right, we're gonna go
ahead and end today's video.
I hope you guys enjoyed it.
Make sure you give it a
big thumbs up if you did.
And we will see you guys tomorrow.
What do you say?
- Bye, boop.
