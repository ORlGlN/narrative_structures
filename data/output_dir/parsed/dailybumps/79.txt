- Hey guys, and welcome to a
very special Daily Bumps video.
This video is paid for by Hot Wheels,
and they partnered with us
in the production of this video.
Today's video is special,
because I have a surprise for Ollie.
He is now the perfect age
for my all-time favorite toy.
Hot Wheels.
♪ This is our life ♪
♪ Let's live it ♪
♪ Live it forever ♪
Hot Wheels knew how excited I was
to share this with Ollie,
so they sent us, not one car,
but literally hundreds of cars.
This is going to blow his mind, you guys.
This is probably a quarter of
what they actually sent us.
But I'm gonna show all this to Ollie,
and see what he thinks.
I think he's gonna be very, very excited.
(upbeat music)
Hey dude!
- Hey.
- I have a surprise for you!
Look at all of these new Hot Wheel cars!
Guess what, Ollie.
- What?
- Hot Wheels sent you all
of these cars to play with.
Just for you.
Isn't that so cool?
- Yeah!
Thank you Hot Wheels!
-  Oh, my gosh, look at this one.
- Whoa.
-  It's a street beast.
That one is called Motosaurus, Ollie.
Is that a real type of dinosaur?
- Yeah.
- It is in Hot Wheels, huh?
Oo, that one is Crate Racer.
That one's cool.
- This one has a trash can.
-  What is that?
- Trash can.
- It's an Aisle Driver,
so it's a shopping cart.
I've never seen that before.
There's so many cool Hot
Wheels to play with, huh?
- Yeah!
- Well, let's open 'em up.
Open up one you wanna play with, dude.
- I'm gonna open this one.
-  The shopping cart one?
-  Yeah.
- It's a shopping cart Hot Wheel,
that is so cool, huh?
- And it has...
- A little guy!
- Yeah, a little guy.
- A little driver.
Okay, Ollie, you have to see this one.
- What?
- This is the dinosaur one,
the Motosaurus.
Check that out.
- (shouts)
- (growls)
Oh, let's get Shark Bite.
- Shark Bite?
Does he chomp on things?
- I think he does chomp on things,
look his mouth even moves.
Look at that.
That's so cool, huh?
- I'm gonna eat you.
- (sound affects) That cool?
Out of all these amazing Hot Wheels,
which one is your favorite?
- This one!
- This one, the gold one?
-  Yeah.
- Whoa, that's the Rogue Hog.
That is a really cool one.
Hey Ollie, what if we take
your favorite Hot Wheel,
and we create the longest
Hot Wheel track we can.
- (gasps)
- Should we do that?
- Yeah!
- What other cars do you
wanna race on the track?
- This one!
- This one?
- Yeah.
Let's do this!
- Alright, Ollie,
I'm gonna give you a lesson
in how to put together a
Hot Wheels track, okay?
This is the track, and this
blue piece is the connector.
So, you just pop it in, just like that
and then you take your other track,
and you pop it in, just like that
and now look, it's twice as long.
- That's a cool track!
- I know, let's make it longer, 'kay?
(upbeat music)
- I put it on!
-  Good job,
let's keep building it!
- I did it!
-  I knew you could, buddy!
That's pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.
- We made our first piece of track.
Now we gotta make a lot more.
(upbeat music)
Look at this huge track
we just built, you guys,
I've never done this before.
This is seriously so cool,
it goes through the entire house!
I think we did pretty
good on that huge track,
didn't we?
- Yeah!
- That's the biggest Hot
Wheels track I've ever seen.
- Yeah.
-  Alright, Ollie.
What do you think of this huge track?
- Good!
-  Should we test it out?
- Yeah!
-  Let's turn all
the boosters on, okay?
- Okay.
(upbeat music)
-  It just keeps goin', huh?
- Yeah.
- I can't believe, you guys,
we made a track go
around our entire house.
It's coming through our hallway,
past Ollie's bedroom,
it goes through my office
and outside, into our courtyard...
Turn that booster on!
We really need that one
to get the car over the
bush, huh?
-  Yeah!
- Isn't that crazy,
you think it's gonna work?
- Yeah, I think so.
- Okay, comes all the way around here.
Around the gnome,
we have it comin' all the way
through our courtyard right now,
over this box,
and then if we're lucky,
it's gonna go all the way around
and back into the playroom!
Let's try it, okay.
Whoa!
- Ah!
(upbeat music)
Two scorpion ones!
- Whoa, they're scorpions?
- Yeah.
- They even have tails?
- Yeah.
- Do you think they're fast on the track?
- I don't think so.
- No, well let's try 'em, 'kay?
Let's follow it!
Whoa!
It's goin', it's goin' Ollie, wait!
Whoa, 'round the gnome!
(upbeat music)
Alright, Ollie, you wanna
see the loop in action?
- Yeah!
- Alright.
Whoa!
- Whoa!
- You want me to see if your
scorpion will go through?
Whoa!
But what is this, Ollie,
all of the cars are just crashing together
at the end of our huge track, huh?
Do you think we need something
to put all these cars in?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, 'cause look they're all just
crashing into each other.
(shouts)
- What are we going to
do with all these cars?
(upbeat music)
Whoa, this is awesome!
- What!
This is so cool!
Ollie, do you know what this is?
- What?
-  It's the Hot
Wheels Super Ultimate Garage!
That's so cool!
Look at all this parking space.
- Whoa!
- The Hot Wheels Super Ultimate Garage
is the single biggest
Hot Wheels item ever.
It stands over three feet tall
and can hold over 140 cars
for hours of endless play.
- This is the car wash.
-  Yeah, this is
where all the cars go
to get clean
and then they're gettin' dry.
Isn't that so cool?
- Is that dry one, and
that one make the bubbles?
- Yeah, ain't that neat?
(upbeat music)
The Super Ultimate Garage features
a continuous motorized elevator
that can hold up to 23 cars at a time.
But watch out for the menacing gorilla,
who can climb the tower
and will try to swipe your
friends out of the elevator.
- Is that a gorilla?
- That's a gorilla!
He's knocking cars off the elevator, look!
- Hey, stop it gorilla!
(grunts)
- They come through here,
and they race.
Whoa!
- Whoa!
(upbeat music)
Woo, I'm flying!
Flying backwards.
Hi, mama!
- Hi, Ollie!
(upbeat music)
-  There's so
many amazing features,
there are endless
story-telling possibilities.
- Over three feet tall!
A gorilla.
Mechanized elevator.
Jet launch pad.
Car wash.
Side-by-side racetrack.
Holds over 140 cars.
- What I love about Hot Wheels
is that it's more than just a toy.
It helps kids develop life skills.
It fuels their imagination,
sparks motor skills as
it develops strength
and dexterity for better building
and there's hours of fun to be had!
Which promotes concentration
for extended periods of time.
I loved Hot Wheels growing up.
It was one of my favorite things
to build and to play with
and I just love that now,
Ollie is the perfect age
that he can do it as well.
Isn't that so cool, Ollie?
- Yeah!
- You love Hot Wheels too?
- Yeah.
- Just like daddy, right?
- Yeah.
- I love you.
Look at all your cars, are
you obsessed with them?
-  Yeah.
- Which one's your absolute favorite?
-  Um, the scorpion one!
- The scorpion one!
That is a pretty cool car, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I love you.
Did you have fun building
that track, today?
- Yeah.
- Had a good time, huh?
'Kay, go play with your cars.
- 'Kay.
- So, if you're a parent
and you're looking for an
awesome gift this holiday season,
I highly recommend the Hot
Wheels Super Ultimate Garage,
this thing is amazing.
It will hold all of your Hot Wheel cars,
and it just is hours of fun, huh?

feature of the whole garage.
-  The washing garage.
