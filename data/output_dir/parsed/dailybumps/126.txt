- Their noise isn't that terrible.
-  Yeah.
(rooster crowing)
- Speaking of...
-  We have to say goodbye.
♫ This is our life
♫ This is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream
♫ This is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
- Good morning
(laughing)
It is morning time.
It's Saturday morning and we are watching,
what are we watching Ollie?
- The Grinch movie.
-  Yeah, we're watching The Grinch.
-  It's my favorite movie.
- Who stole Christmas.
Hey Ollie,
do you think the Grinch
is gonna come to our house
again this year?
(laughing)
He's like I hope not.
Um yeah.
If you guys don't know last year
the Grinch came to our house
and he was not very nice.
He did all kinds of
crazy stuff at our house.
But anyways we were just having
a really fun lazy Saturday
morning.
It's been really, really nice.
I love mornings like this
where we get to all cuddle.
Bryan's actually already
getting ready for the day
so we think we're gonna
go ahead and do that next.
What should we do today, bud?
- Um...
Go to CJ Bailey's house.
- CJ Bailey's house?
(laughing)
That's a good idea.
We'll see.
Are you giving Luna love?
Finn you're being so sweet.
(baby laughing)
The truth is Finn can be
a little rough sometimes
but he also can be super sweet too.
Look we're dressed now.
Finn is all dressed,
Mama's all dressed,
Ollie's all dressed.
Ollie are you dressed?
-  Um yeah
and I'm in the toilet pooping.
(laughing)
- I don't know if you heard him say
in the toilet poopin'.
All right you almost done?
-  Yeah.
- Okay.
He's so cute.
You guys I was just looking
outside at the chicken coop
and I can see something
really cool in there.
Can you guys see that?
There's a little bird
inside the chicken coop.
I wonder how he got in there.
Let's see if I can get a closer look.
Do you see that little bird?
Oh my gosh.
Oh my gosh it's like
I wonder what kind of bird that is.
It's got a pretty big beak.
I feel like it squeezed through the top
'cause the top is definitely open.
How cute.
I wanna keep you forever and ever.
(laughing)
Should we keep the birdie?
- Yeah.
(laughing)
-  Finn.
We were just so excited
to show you what we caught
and now it's gone.
(laughing)
Awww he's so sad.
Yeah we just ran inside to tell Bryan
and Finn to come outside come outside
and Finn came out and
he was so excited and
the bird's gone.
I'm guessing he like got out
got in through those little cracks
and then just like went back out.
But that was so cute.
It's okay.
The birdie it gets to go
find its mommy and daddy.
'Cause he was lost.
Yes and now he's back
with his mommy and daddy.
So that's a good thing, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
All right boys.
We have been cooped up in the
house getting the house clean,
working on stuff, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
And now we are on a little Polaris ride.
Bryan is actually finishing getting ready
for a little special thing
that we're doing tonight.
So I thought I'm gonna take the kids out
'cause they've been
cooped up a little bit.
They're eating an apple snack
and we're headed out on the Polaris.
I did want to show you guys.
If you guys are wondering
what happened to the big tub
that was inside of our Halloween maze
we actually painted it.
It was all red and so now it's all white
and I think we're gonna use
it as like part of a garden
and kind of plant plants in it and stuff.
I thought it was kind of a cute idea.
So it's that and then there's
my tunnel of bugs right now.
I don't know what I'm gonna do with that.
I'm guessing my dad will take
it apart and use it for parts.
Here we go boys.
Let's go.
(screaming)
And there's my well down there.
Where Samara climbs out of
during the Halloween maze.
I wonder how long that
thing will be there?
(laughing)
You guys it is literally the nicest
most beautiful day.
It just feels so good
and I love riding around
with my pups and my kids on our property.
It's just so nice.
We're checking out our
little watering hole.
If you've been following our watering hole
since we moved in it was full of water,
it was emptied now it's like
a little bit of water and
we really are not sure
what the water is but it's
always fun to check on it
and there's a little water down there
so once again is it a broken pipe?
Is it a natural spring coming up
from the ground in Southern California?
I don't know.
(inspiring instrumental)
- Hey guys.
I have been working in
my office all morning
because I've been trying
to arrange something
really special for Missy and I tonight.
Completely last minute.
You guys know me.
That's just who I am.
It's how I roll.
These past couple of months
have been so busy for us
I feel like we have not really
had a good chance to get away
and we desperately need it.
(laughing)
We just kinda need a little break.
A little vacation.
Everyone needs a little
vacation every now and then.
You know what I mean?
So I've been in here booking everything.
We're gonna stay at
this really nice resort
not too far away which is cool too.
But yeah booking everything last minute
is so annoying and I'm just like
why didn't I think ahead?
Why didn't I think ahead Luna?
Luna got a haircut yesterday.
She looks like a puppy.
I'm gonna go see what Missy's up to now.
All right.
Let's go see what Missy is up to.
(country instrumental)
All right babe.
What's going on out here?
- Well I feel like I've
hinted towards this
for a while.
-  Oh really?
Something about to go down?
- Yeah.
I just can't have this many roosters.
So I have a lady who like
who gave me the fertile eggs
and she said if any of them
turn out to be roosters
that she'd take them back and
she has this cute little farm
she basically just like
raises chickens and
sells like chicks and
fertile eggs and stuff and so
I know they're gonna
be safe and happy there
and I'm really excited
about where they're gonna go
but they can't stay here anymore.
(laughing)
- Yeah.
You can't go home but you can't stay here.
Chickens.
- So far they're not super aggressive.
Their noise isn't that terrible.
-  Yeah.
- But...
(rooster crowing)
Speaking of.
(laughing)
-  We have to say goodbye.
- But yeah they just,
they're eating all of the
food and they're picking on
my chickens and they're
like beating them up
(door rattles)
-  Do you hear them?
Going crazy.
(rooster crowing)
All right.
-  Oh hey.
-  Oh hey.
(laughing)
-  So yeah.
- What's up guys?
-  It's a little bittersweet.
-  Nah they're gonna
go somewhere way cooler
honestly.
- Oh hi.
Speaking of I think this
is Kristoff right here.
-  Huge.
Look how huge.
- I know I'm kinda scared of him.
Roosters have attacked me so
I don't really like roosters.
- That is a...
(rooster crowing)
Okay. Chill.
We're right here.
Honestly guys.
Come on.
Yeah that, he's huge.
I have not realized how big he's gotten.
-  He's a big chicken.
-  Oh my gosh.
- Hey, hey.
Calm down.
Don't, don't.
-  Oh this is gonna be interesting.
- Oh god. Oh god.
I am so scared.
(screams)
(laughing)
I am not scared of any of my chickens.
Like not scared of any of them.
That one scares me.
-  Yeah it's just a matter of time
before he gets your eyeball.
- Here we go.
I'm gonna go through the other way.
-  All right.
Closed this little door.
Now they can't get out.
Does the shushing help?
- No I don't know.
Helps me.
Helps calm me down.
(shushing)
(laughing)
Stop. Stop.
-  He doesn't wanna leave.
Wow.
- No. Stop. Relax.
Okay.
-  Got him.
- I got him.
-  Good job.
- He's good.
He has big talons though I'm scared.
- Oh wow look at that.
Woo.
So we have to load the
chickens up into this crate.
(crate rattling)
This is actually Luna's crate.
All right.
Hang out in there.
Kay.
Got a couple more friends...
He is so angry.
Awwww.
He's gonna be so much happier
honestly at this new place.
- I know. He's gonna have
all the women he wants.
(laughing)
- Yeah. True.
Just a huge, huge farm like I
think we should try and visit
some day but she has so many chickens
and so much land.
So this was Cruella.
(chicken bawking)
- No.
This is,
this one is Elsa.
-  Oh Elsa.
- We'll name her, 'cause that was Kristoff
this is Hans.
-  Yeah.
(laughing)
Because Elsa is not a princess.
- Nope. Elsa is a...
-  He's a prince.
(laughing)
So this was our last Silkie that made it.
Turned out to be also a rooster.
- And you know what this is Cruella DeVil
and let's keep her Cruella DeVil.
-  Yeah.
- She's a Cruella for sure.
-  Look at Luna right now.
She is so excited.
She's jumping up and down
staring at the chickens like
just let me play with them.
(laughing)
- We putted them in a cage.
-  Yeah we gotta
say goodbye to them Ollie.
Did you say goodbye?
- Bye.
(laughing)
-  Bye guys.
Thanks for hanging out with us.
You're gonna really enjoy the new farm.
(laughing)
For sure.
- Bye chickens.
-  Saying goodbye
to the chickens yep.
- Bye chickens.
-  Yep.
Hew Ollie what are you holdin'?
- Some bread and some toys.
- Exactly.
That is all you need in life, huh?
Bread and toys.
This kid knows what's up.
He also invented a new game.
Ollie what's it called?
- A magic pumpkin.
- Yeah they think that
this new poof we got
for Missy's new nook area is a pumpkin
and so they stand on it and balance
and then jump off.
Whoa.
That was cool dude.
You did a spin.
Balancing on this thing
is not as easy as it seems
you guys.
I've seen Finn stand up on this,
wobble and like I see him get his balance.
It's so cool.
(Finn screaming into megaphone)
Speaking of Finn...
Hey dude.
Do you wanna try and
balance on the pumpkin?
-  Yeah.
-  Stand up.
Let's see if he can do it.
- Get up.
The magic pumpkin.
(laughing)
-  Stand up.
Oh my gosh.
You did it.
Whoa.
Balance.
Balance.
Yeah.
Now jump.
Whoa.
(laughing)
That's so cool.
The boys love this.
It's so funny.
Okay.
What's going on?
- I'm gonna look like a vampire on this.
-  A vampire?
- I'm a vampire.
- Whoa.
Yeah we've started getting
a couple different furniture
pieces for Missy's nook area.
I'm not gonna show you anything else.
I don't wanna give it
away but we have I think
designed a really cool space
for Missy to film videos
again so she's excited
to get started filming
and stuff like that.
You really like bread, don't you?
(Ollie mumbling)
Just like your mother.
(laughing)
Go. Go. Go. Go.
Go Finn. Go Finn.
Oh no he's wobbling.
Stand up.
(Finn screaming)
Stand up.
Stand up.
(Finn screaming)
Look at him wobbling.
(Finn screaming)
Stand all the way up Finn.
Oh no.
(laughing)
Oh.
You okay?
- Yeah.
(laughing)
- Everybody dance now.
(upbeat electronic)
- Mimi and Papa are here.
- Mimi and Papa have arrived
because they are going to
be watching the boys while Missy and I
get our little getaway going.
Hey Papa.
Ollie confessed to us
that you taught him what
blood-sucking vampires are.
- Me?
-  I said that there is
no way Papa taught you that.
(laughing)
- All of a sudden he just
kept talking about vampires
and how they suck blood
and I'm like how does he know that?
- How did you learn that?
And he goes Papa told me.
I was like no.
No he didn't.
-  He always tells us it's you.
- Blames all the stuff on Papa.
(laughing)
'Cause it's totally true.
-  It is not my mother-in-law.
(laughing)
- We've made it to our little place.
We are so excited for our weekend getaway.
We've got a cute little
place down by the beach
and yeah we're just
excited to kind of relax.
We've been going for the past week.
Couple weeks, couple months
and it's kind of a nice
little getaway.
I'd say it was kind of
for like my birthday
just because normally we
go on a little getaway
and it was my birthday like last week so
yeah we're really excited to just kind of
relax.
Bryan's upstairs already
getting ready for bed.
'Cause it is night time.
