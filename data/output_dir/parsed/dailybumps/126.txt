-  Hey bud, hi.
(fast paced, rhythmic rock music)
♫ This is our life, this is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream, this is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it, live it forever
- Good morning, guys.
Good morning.
- How did you sleep?
Good.
- (gasps) What's today?
- Um, Share day!
- Yep, it is share day at school.
And he is pretty excited about school.
On the other hand, I'm just so tired.
Are you tired?
- No.
- No, he's not tired.
Me and Bryan are just exhausted.
We've had such a busy week
and it's not over yet.
But my dad is actually going
to take Ollie to school today.
Which is so nice of him.
You're so excited to go with Papa, huh?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- I think that's gonna be really cool.
Oh, don't mess up your hair.
(laughs) Today is share day
and what is the letter?
- Unicorn.
- U.
- U.
- And you are gonna share
a unicorn head. Huh?
- Yeah.
- Kind of like those horse
heads that you put on.
But we have a unicorn one
and we thought that would be really funny.
It's actually really
hard to find something
in your playroom that starts with a U.
If you guys have any ideas of
a toy that starts with a U,
please let me know in the comments.
Because the only suggestion
Ollie can give me is what,
what starts with U?
- Underpants.
- Yeah, underpants.
And he thinks it's so funny.
I'm like, "Well, you can't
share underpants at school."
But we do have like a
Captain Underpants like--
- Cape.
- Cape. But I mean, Captain
Underpants starts with a C,
not necessarily a U.
So, I debated that one but
we have a unicorn head.
But that's the only thing I could think of
that starts with a U is
underpants and unicorn. (laughs)
So, yeah, all right.
Are you gonna have a good day at school?
- Yeah.
- All right. I'll see you later, okay?
- Okay.
(Missy laughs)
-  Good morning, guys.
So, this morning I am going
through footage from yesterday's shoot.
And there is so much good stuff, you guys.
I'm freaking out (laughs).
I honestly don't know how I'm
gonna edit this all together.
But I think it's gonna end
up looking really cool.
So, be on the lookout for the
Tribe music video very soon.
And if you guys have
not gotten the song yet,
I'll have it linked in the iCard.
So that you guys can jam out to it.
But yeah, I'm really excited.
This is gonna be a very long edit.
I may need to get someone
to help me with it
so I can get it done this year. (laughs)
Look at this, though, you guys.
Look how epic this shot is (laughs)
All of us ready for battle (laughs)
The boys had so much fun yesterday.
So, I'm hoping to spend not
too much time on this today
because I do have other
things that need to be done.
But yes, I'm very excited
for the Tribe music video.
Missy has broken out her old
sewing box and sewing machine.
And she is working hard on something.
(laughs) This is so funny.
You even got your dress
form from the guest room?
-  Yeah.
-  That's technically a decor piece
but sure, we can use it.
-  (laughs) It'll work.
-  At the end of
this Halloween, babe,
you're gonna be making all
the boys' clothes (laughs).
- I've never done anything like this.
Like, I love doing projects.
But I've never like sewn
something that has to be worn.
-  Yeah. (laughs)
- I'm pretty stressed about it.
There may have been some tears last night.
(Bryan laughs)
But today, I'm feeling a
little more optimistic.
It's kind of coming along.
 Yeah.
I just don't know if it'll turn
out, but I guess we'll see.
- And if you guys think
you know what costume Missy
is making right now let us know
down below in the comments,
what your guess is and
maybe you'll be right.
-  Hi!
-  Hi
Finn! What are you doin?
- Pop.
-  You eatin' a pop-tart?
- Yeah.
-  Finn
misses his brother, don't you?
- (mumbles)
- 
Yeah, Ollie's at school.
He's been running around
with swords and stuff all day
wanting to battle and
I'm like, You need Ollie.
Just wait a little, just
a couple more hours, and
Ollie will be out of school okay?
- (baby mumbles)
-  Then
you can play with him.
Hey can I have a bite of that pop-tart?
(exaggerates bite)
(Bryan laughs)
-  So we
got a couple of new additions
to the fish tank last night.
One of them being a starfish!
Look at our starfish you
guys. He has seven arms.
Yes, that's right. Seven arms.
And uh, he's got a little
bit of sand on him.
But he's been moving like crazy. Hi dude!
We got a couple of really
cool aninami's and coral
and stuff that move.
So there's one, we have one up
there that I think literally
has already doubled in
size, which is crazy.
Check out that one you guys.
That one.
We also got a really cool fire angelfish,
but he was just put in,
so he's a little shy.
It takes like a week or
two for the fish to really
start coming out and like
interacting with other fish.
Can't seem to find him you guys.
He's hiding pretty good.
The craziest thing happened tho today
with the take and I want to tell you guys.
Ollie woke up this morning
and he saw his red shrimp
sitting in the sand,
didn't look very good.
He was very afraid that he may have died.
Missy said, "Don't worry,
he's just sleeping."
She didn't know what happened.
Turns out, his red shrimp Kai
just molted his exoskeleton!
So this is actually the
exoskeleton of his shrimp Kai
and he shed it, because
that's what shrimp do.
And I had no idea that
it included the legs,
the antenna, everything.
-  It's really
just a little shrimp--
-  But with no body.
It's like his armor. (laughs)
- I literally was like, oh no I did that.
No it's just sleeping,
it's just taking a nap.
He's like okay.
-  Yeah,
I saw the two shrimp
and then I saw this and
I was like uh-oh did he
put in another shrimp last
night and not tell us?
And it died?
It died?
I'm like, how does two
shrimp turn into three?
-  Yeah.
-  That's how you guys.
- Yeah, no I was literally--
So crazy!
- And then I just like had an epiphany.
Like I wonder if it's not--
Yeah.
- So I googled it and like oh
my god it's just the shell.
-  It's
cool that it's bright red,
even though, cause a lot
of shrimp moltings are
just like clear.
- Yeah. Pretty cool. I wonder
if they would have ate it,
if we left it in there?
-  I don't know. Maybe.
This guy likes to eat for sure. (laughs)
-  You guys, it
feels so good today!
It's definitely not
cold, but it's not hot.
Yesterday and the day before
were like 100 degrees.
It just feels so nice today.
I'm actually headed in to get Ollie.
Um, Finn is sleeping in the car.
My mom is watching him, cause
she's just come along with me.
So it worked out cause
he's sleeping, and I don't
have to like wake him up and bring him in.
But I'm super excited to see Ollie.
And I am so excited to
eat cause I am so hungry!
I've been working all
day, and I need food.
(gentle music)
-  Hey bud.
Hi. Did you have a good nap?
Hi bud!
-  Hi
- Did you have a fun day at school?
- Good.
- Did you have fun, um,
having papa drop you off?
- Yeah, but--
Is it so cool?
But what did papa up at our house?
- Papa's at home, but I can pick you up.
Pretty cool, huh?
You were sleepin' huh?
- Mmhm
Alright I'm gonna check you out, okay?
So, Ollie did you learn about U's today?
- Yeah.
- And you drew these U's!
-  Mmhm.
- And you, what start's with a U?
- Um
- Umbrella?
- Umbrella
- Unicorn?
- Unicorn.
- How was it sharing
your little unicorn head?
- Good.
- Did the kids like it?
- Yeah.
- That's so neat huh?
-  Well hey there
Finn, are we going shopping?
So ya, me and Finn are going
shopping for some things
because if you don't know
it's almost his birthday!
He's eating a hamburger
right now from McDonalds
cause he was a hungry boy. Awe. (laughs)
And my mom and Ollie are
at a kid's clothing store
looking for something that I needed for
Finn's Halloween costume.
Really trying to work as fast as possible
on a lot of this stuff,
so we're basically killing
two birds with one stone;
which is always cool.
But now we gotta get some
party stuff for you, huh?
You ready to party?
(baby mumbles)
How old are you gonna be?
(mumbles)
Say two!
- Two!
Two!
-  Awe! Are
you so excited to see Ollie?
You missed him, huh?
- Yeah.
- You guys are so cute!
Ollie, you wanna know something
interesting? Lemme show you.
Remember how this morning
we found your shrimp
and it looked like he was taking a nap.
And you were kinda worried about him, huh?
- Mmhm.
- Well, guess what?
- What?
- We found him! That's not
him though. That's his shell.
He took his shell off
and he's still alive.
He's still in there. See,
there's Kai right there.
- (mumbles)
- That's just his shell.
Basically, he grew out
of his little outfit so
he took it off and he's got a new one on.
Isn't that crazy?
- Yeah.
- Cause that's not him,
that's just like his outfit.
- That's his shell?
- Mmhm, that's his shell.
Do you wanna see him inside there?
Look.
Do you see him?
- I wanna see.
- Oh look, he's over there.
We thought he was taking a
nap, but that was just his
shell he took off.
How neat, huh?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna go and throw him in the trash.
- No. Just leave it there. (laughs)
He's like, um.. that's kinda gross.
- Ollie isn't that such good
news that your shrimp is okay?
- Mmhm.
- You thought he died, huh?
Yeah, but he's okay!
It's just a cool thing that
shrimp's do, apparently.
(laughing)
Did you guys know that? That
shrimps can molt their skin.
I think that's crazy or
their exoskeleton. Huh?
And you're playing with another fish.
What are you playing with now?
- Um, a sea-diver and a saw.
- Yeah, that's so cool.
(mumbles)
Where did you get this cool
little submarine thing?
- Um, Coleman picked it
out for me last time.
- Oh he did? Oh that's so cool!
So you have like a cool
little submarine and
this is Kai and he's
wearing a diving suit.
Why do you have Kai from
Ninjago wearing this suit
and not the diver guy?
- (mumbles)
- Oh, I see. I see.
And then you have a--
It has claws!
- Whoa, it has claws?
- Mmhm.
- That's so cool. And then
you have like a cool shark.
- Mmhm, it's a baby shark.
- It's a baby great white shark. Huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's pretty cool. (laughs)
How was your day?
- Good.
- Did you have a good day at school?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. What'd you share?
- Um, my unicorn head.
- Unicorn head! That's so cool!
-  Alright boys!
Guess who's here?
Mimi and Papa!
(children squealing)
(Missy laughs)
That's right, Mimi and Papa
are here cause Mommy and Daddy
are going on a date!
We're going out tonight.
We actually have a
friend of ours birthday.
You guys know her.
Crystal, who does a lot
of our photography shoots.
(cat noises)
He's a kitty cat right now.
Yeah, we're going out
and I'm real excited.
So, these boys are gonna
hangout with Mimi and Papa
and then go night night, huh?
- Meow.
-  And they just
turned into kittens.
That's it.
(Missy laughs)
But anyways, I think we
are gonna go ahead and
end the blog before we head out.
So, make sure you give
this video a big thumbs up!
Hey, give thumbs up, kitty cats!
Thumbs up kitty cats!
(meow)
Oh, look up.
Can you give a thumbs up kitty cat Finn?
Oh my goodness.
Alright, and we'll see you guys tomorrow!
(upbeat music)
