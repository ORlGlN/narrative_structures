such a great job job sitting on that but
I've been out driving some things for
her and then - the past few hours I've
been watching the cameras and other
chickens keep going up there and like
I'm hoping they're just like sitting on
them I don't know what they're doing but
I'm really hoping you're not taking them
or hurting them sipan's not even an
almond right now Kellie is Kelly please
don't smash my chicken eggs and it's
possible they're just going on up there
and laying their own ice because there
does seem to be a lot more eggs under
there
this is jumping me out Pam go sit on
your eggs don't let the ladies lay their
eggs over there so you told Matt I just
got everything in order to put her in
here so that none of the other chickens
can mess with them but let's just check
on them check in hi Jackie
I think so I don't know what she's doing
get are your Kelly yeah
just check-in my eggs they all look good
they're all nice and warm definitely got
some extras in here though all right I
think I've separated the fertile eggs
with the non four legs I'm going to take
these ones in and I'm going to continue
to watch them because you guys are
having a chicken disaster with your
stealing of eggs and laying more eggs
and not can't get up there get up there
and take care of your eggs just okay I'm
sorry she's like there's too many babies
I don't know which ones are mine those
are yours
don't hurt them or smash them with your
sharp nails there you go there you go
all your chickens need to be be careful
of the babies thank you for your XO
Ollie's the chickens are being crazy -
guess what did you know what mama did
mama put baby eggs under Pam to take
care of it's not cool yeah so Pam is
going to give us some baby chicken yeah
you want more baby chicks cool all right
Missy is setting up her chicken coop for
her broody hen I'm so happy I'm happiest
all right now I am putting together this
it's like a little coffee table storage
thing it's just white and plastic are
you going to use it for in front of the
chicken coop to hold a lot of the
materials let me see needs right now I
think we have like the old cabinet from
our kitchen and it looks pretty gross so
I'm going to make all these pieces into
hopefully a nice little storage place
time mover thing somebody makes our
stomachs like four times okay baby it's
okay
like so afraid my legs rock or something
so you got your own little nesting box
in there for her see usually any egg
like that like this color that are in
here are no last eggs that look like
that it's like Easter eggs yeah you know
she says just silkies and at least the
four white ones the little arms will
hatch first and they will hatch after
but sometimes she'll just be done being
broody after the other ones hatch and so
she'll give up so we might have to take
in the incubator if she sucks there are
like I'm done you catched we're moving
her around always hey here we go little
them that'll be a lot nicer
smart today might be we should figure
this fella
for all of her food for her I'm gonna
put it now if you like filled it all up
oh we definitely saved the day I think
that'll help with those eggs a lot more
all right you guys got it all finished
got it where it needs to be and I'm
going to show you a little before nap
all right got the new storage thing all
set up so we have their scratch moister
shells food extra little tools anything
that we need can go right and that's
nice little looking bucks yeah wanna see
that nice
I can till now that I I'm going to
continue I got just so I know we're
gonna do the Power Sword
ah you got him what oh I want to give
you guys one more update on the pool in
the backyard because when we come back
this place is gonna be completely
different and in fact it may actually be
Dutch check out this fire pit bro well
you can't swim in there no but you can
roast marshmallows
it makes s'mores you want to make
s'mores yeah so this is the fire pit
they carved it all out today and added a
ton more concrete although they started
to do the framing for the roof like
these beams they're huge it's gonna hang
over and it's going to be like exposed
beams and when they get all the robots
gonna be insane and then they also
finished the coping so this is the
coping for the whole pool we have all
this smooth outside but still I got
little cracks and like it's a little
rough and then inside actually matches
all that and this also has to be painted
too so it's going to be cool because
it's going to feel like the rock is like
surrounding the whole pool there's also
a lot of cool surprises
Ollie do you see all the starfish
starfish and shells and lots of food
things to find when we're out here
swimming are you so excited for your
pool to be done well soon so yeah
there's still lots to do they obviously
still need to do concrete out here and
finish but it's gonna be pretty exciting
when we get back to see how it looks
woofle you love that yeah what is it
called
Oh take it it go good job that's very
good practice our pronunciation can you
get to spend there you go try to touch
it on the side
you are seasoned guy I do want to see
something going to show you what you can
do the fitted spinner why he so God he's
like yeah I'm pretty cool ah good job
that's right you guys the fidgets
spinner craze is still going on all he
is obsessed with them this one's
actually broken I believe like the three
things are out of it they're proof now
yeah ah v now what happen is they kept
dropping them and then piece the little
ball bearings would like fall out we
just took them all out and actually
works pretty good for him yeah I just
got the coolest fitted spinner I've
never seen one like this do you want to
see it are you excited luck came in this
cool little box says I heart fidget you
want to open it neat huh isn't it cool
look and professional one so I picked
this up on Amazon and it's kind of like
a one-of-a-kind businessman I've never
seen them like this it's made out of
complete brass and it's like really
heavy in your hand to hold something to
take out and show you guys Missy really
likes this one too huh one is so cool
because first of all it is heavy it like
feels like throwing at all is not so
heavy compared to yours so this one's
made out of plastic and this one's made
out of brass so it has these six little
spinners on it versus three that come on
normal fitted spinners and it is smooth
you guys it is so smooth check this out
it like can go so fast so far and it's
metal so it actually like gives a little
hum sound is he's going to get it going
really really fast and see if we can
show or listen to the hum sound
interesting huh yeah I like a couple
things about it number one it's heavier
so just feel like professional number
two is actually smaller I feel like it
fits better between my fingers and
actually like before I could never do I
even do this yeah where's your granny
Cruz for ever and it's just like I don't
know it's so I suppose found more fun
also you can do this easier without
hurting yourself yeah that's true you
can literally hit it ooh
get it goin bad I love the colors it
makes almost like a solid red and blue
line around their circles because it's
going so fast
yeah that's crazy you can also twist
these babies off in case you like it
unbalanced or in case you want like less
of yeah look at now it's all wobbly oh
you gonna do different ones yeah you can
take any of them off it's not balanced
it's lighter lighter
pretty cool huh huh all right I'll you
try it see if you can get it going
really fast more than the other one the
assistant his name what does look at
that yeah you can get it going dude can
you get it going really fast whoa you
doing it dude yeah that's pretty neat
huh all right we got the dragon hold on

Elmo Elmo can at least one minute 30
we did have some interference from the
toddler back on the table that's been
