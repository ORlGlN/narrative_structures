- Good mornin'!
(babbles)
Good morning, guys.
How are you today, bud?
He's a little out of it.
Had to do a few little tricks
to get him not out of it.
I'll show it to you in just a second.
(sneezes)
Whew, bless you!
Ollie, how are you this morning, bud?
-  Good.
- Are we getting back on track?
I'm just tryin' to get cleaned up.
It's just been one of those days,
one of those weekends,
one of those weeks.
We are excited for a fun, fun day, huh?
- Yeah.
- And I was saying Finn is a little
bit grouchy today, huh?
And everything I was trying
to do was not making him
in a good mood.
Look at this kid.
(growls)
Wow, wow, you are not
in a good mood, are you?
And there is only one way to get this kid
into a good mood.
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
-  Yeah!
- Meow!
- Meow!
(both meowing)
(slurping)
(both meowing)
(Finn laughing)
(purring)
(meowing)
Ready, are you ready?
-  Yeah.
(hisses, then meows)
(Finn laughing)
-  Show me your kitty cat.
Say meow.
(screams)
(screaming)
(laughter, growls)
This is a feral cat right here.
Feral cat.
(Finn meowing)
I love you, I love you, feral kitty cat.
I love you.
(screaming)
Oh my goodness, ow.
Woo!
That's the only way to
get him into a good mood.
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
And now I have a happy little baby.
So we are actually doing
something very special today.
I have a ton of books.
I love books, we love reading books,
and in the playroom we
have tons of books in here.
They're a little unorganized right now,
but tons of books in there,
tons of books in here,
and this doesn't even begin to tell you
how many books are actually
in their room as well.
But is finally time to go through them
and donate them, huh?
Where are we gonna donate them to?
- We're gonna donate them to kids.
- To kids, you're right.
Oh wow, Finn's just like,
"I don't like this book,
"I don't like that book."
So yeah, we have a lot of books
and I'm kinda getting bored
of a lot of the books that we do have.
The ones I've read a
lot I'll probably keep,
just 'cause obviously they mean a lot,
but there are some books
that it's just like
we don't ever read.
Oh, I remember reading this one to you.
This is like the first
book you ever laughed at.
You thought it was so funny when I said,
"Casper swiftly slides down the hill."
You thought that was hilarious.
Swiftly slides down the hill.
He thought that was so funny.
So, yeah, we'll keep this one.
Certain ones that we are
really attached to,
we'll keep and put them
in a special spot.
We definitely have a lot of books
that we could donate,
so we're gonna do that.
So we just went through all of these
and we're gonna keep these books
and so far we're getting rid
of some of these, but I will say
that whenever we go through books,
we get very sidetracked
and we just start reading all the books,
'cause we basically just
read all these, huh?
We also just went through
Baby's First Words
and Finn did really good on them, huh?
- Yeah.
- You said all the words.
Let's see if I can show you one.
All right, Finn.
Say spoon.
- Spoon.
-  Say table.
- Table.
-  Say bib.
- Bib.
-  Oh gosh, here's
another hundred words book,
but it's actually from our
cousin Alyvia and Casey
and Rose on Finn's first birthday,
so we obviously can't
get rid of this one, huh?
Oh wow!
Ollie found some of our books
that we have from when we visited.
This is one that we did in Seattle.
-  Ooh, let's keep this.
-  Dada!
-  Dada!
Ollie, I guess we can't
get rid of this one, huh?
- Yeah, this one too.
-  That one too?
That one's when we went
to London, we saw Shrek,
and then this one is from the London Eye.
Look at that.
There we all are.
-  That's a cute one.
Can we keep it?
-  You know, I
think we should donate it.
- No!
-  I'm not gonna donate our book
of a picture of us in it, you silly boy.
Aww, here's an even better picture of us.
Look at my babies.
Aww, my mom and dad.
That was such a fun trip
when we went to London.
So one thing about me is that I love books
and I love reading the kids books,
I love cycling through books,
and just going through these books,
these are all the books
we're keeping at this point.
(laughs)
And these are all the books
that we are getting rid
of, which is not a lot.
We need to, we need to get
rid of more books, bud.
I just found this book, though,
and oh my gosh, I read this book to Ollie
so many times.
I wasn't my favorite book,
but obviously it was
Ollie's favorite book,
'cause you ate some of it.
- Yeah.
-  So many books
have been eaten by Ollie.
- Because they taste like paper.
I like to eat, taste the paper.
- And I would like to
get a general opinion
about Where the Wild Things Are book,
because it is like my least
favorite book to read,
but Bryan loves this book,
and I'll definitely keep it around
because it's one of his favorites.
I don't know, I never understood it.
It was always so weird to me.
Now, the movie I thought was kinda cute.
I wasn't like a huge fan of it.
Bryan loved the movie, loves this book.
I'm not a big fan.
Do you like this book?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
- It's a cute one.
-  All right, we'll
keep it around, then.
Maybe I'll get into it when
they are older and stuff.
So let me know down in the comments
if you guys like Where
the Wild Things Are,
if you like the book,
if you like the movie,
if you've ever heard of it.
I'm not a big fan.
- Oh my gosh, What Does the Fox Say!
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!
-  Do you remember that?
- Yeah!
-  When you were a
baby, you loved this song.
- Yeah.
-  Loved it, it
was like the only thing
that would put you to bed.
- Yeah, can we read it?
-  We'll keep it.
I am very attached to this book.
It is the book to What Does the Fox Say?
Actually really, really
cool illustrations.
I don't know, it's such a fun book.
♪ Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho! ♪
♪ Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho! ♪
-  ♪ Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho! ♪
♪ Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho! ♪
-  ♪ A-hee-ahee ha-hee! ♪
♪ A-hee-ahee ha-hee! ♪
(laughing)
So we will definitely be keeping this,
and I actually feel like we could find
some footage of Ollie
and Mimi and Papa dancing
to this song, 'cause they loved this.
Ahh, what are you doing?
(Finn growling)
Oh, it's a crocodile book.
I didn't know he'd ever read this one,
but he loves it right now.
Okay, so check this out.
We have tons of books here,
tons of books there,
and I'm telling you right now,
it goes up there, 'cause
we dropped the ones
that we're not reading right now
onto this one, and now
there's tons of books there.
Tons of books there.
You'd be surprised how many books
can be held in this thing.
And we've got books in here, even.
It's ridiculous.
We are a little obsessed with books.
But we definitely cycle through them,
so I want to take the ones
that we're not reading
and bring them into the playroom
and then get rid of the ones
that we're not going to read again,
'cause there's, I think,
quite a bit of them,
especially in here.
You guys, I am now swimming in books.
So many books!
I am having a hard time letting go
of a lot of our books,
but we have to do this.
So right now I'm going through the books
that are all up on Ollie's bed
and these are all the books
that we cycle through quite a bit.
How to Catch a Monster, one
of his absolute favorites,
or both of their favorites.
Dragons Love Tacos, we've
got Dragons Love Tacos
and Dragons Love Tacos Two.
Goodnight Moon is obviously the best one.
We end our night, almost
every single night,
reading this one.
Every single night, I
mean, I definitely can read
this in the dark because
I have it memorized.
In fact, I have a lot of
these books memorized.
This one, oh my gosh.
I could say this one by heart.
This one could literally --
yeah, I have been
reading this one to Ollie
since he was a little baby.
We both could do this by heart.
I've done it before,
and Bryan was laughing at me
'cause I was just saying it all.
All right, we've got all the books
that we like to read a lot
and a couple new ones
that we're gonna try and incorporate.
These are our favorites.
We pick three every night to read.
And these are the books
we're going to keep
but we're gonna take 'em to the playroom
because we just haven't
really been into them.
So while we were on our quest
for donating books, we
found this cool book,
which we actually haven't used a lot of.
And so I think it'd be fun
to show you what letter
you're learning this week.
Does that sound good?
-  Yeah.
- So this week, he's going to be learning
the letter G.
Can you say G?
- G.
-  G, so this is the letter G
and tomorrow he goes to school
and you're gonna learn
how to do it, right?
- Yeah.
-  All right, so
I'm going to show him
how to draw the uppercase
G and the lowercase g.
And Ollie is getting so good
at holding his pen, look at that!
That's awesome.
You just gotta pinch it, right?
All right, you go ahead and try first.
(upbeat music)
Whoa, so you know that you have to start
with the dot and then
end with the dot, right?
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's show me how you do this one.
(upbeat music)
Wow, I'm so proud of you.
I'm sure the marker makes it
a little more slippery, huh?
Do you think you can
do it without the dots?
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you wanna try?
(Finn babbling)
That is pretty good, Ollie!
Awesome try!
All right, we've got all the books
that we are donating loaded up
and we are headed off
to go donate them, yay!
I think Finn's excited.
Finn's probably actually
gonna fall asleep.
Daddy's actually getting some work done,
so he's gonna stay home and do that
and we're gonna go donate some books
and maybe pick out a couple new books.
Hopefully not too many, though,
'cause we've got a lot of books.
Like, we're good. (laughs)
All right, we are getting ready
to donate all our books now.
Could you help Mommy carry them in?
-  Yes.
-  Here, you grab one side.
You gonna open the door, Finn?
Open the door for Mama.
(upbeat music)
All right, you donated
all your books, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Good job!
I'm proud of you guys.
- Yeah.
-  Now it's time to
go get some new books, 'kay?
-  Yeah.
-  'Kay.
We're now at lunch with Papa and Mimi.
(all cheering)
We are at the kids' favorite place.
Where are we at?
- Freebirds!
-  Freebird!
You got a quesadilla?
- Yeah.
-  Yum!
- I love quesadillas.
-  You do love quesadillas,
and you're getting a burrito?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, you love burritos, huh?
I wanna see you take a big bite of that.
(Mimi laughing)
Good job!
(upbeat music)
All right, now that we
have donated all our books,
we are at Barnes and Noble
and we are gonna pick out some fun books.
- Look!
-  Did you find
the Harry Potter stuff?
-  Yeah.
-  Oh my goodness.
How cool.
Daddy needs to come here and see all this.
So we're gonna pick out some fun new books
for the boys in the kids' section
and hopefully find new ones
that we can, you know, get really into
and love, huh?
(upbeat music)
- Gonna do some dancing?
Maybe tell a story?
-  Can you sing Annie?
All right, Ollie, we've been looking
at all kinds of books,
and these are the ones
that we've got picked out.
What do you think?
You think that's a good selection?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
All right, show me which
one is your favorite one
that you're the most excited to read.
-  This one.
-  This one?
-  Yeah.
-  What's Next Door,
this one actually looks
like a really fun one.
I think you're gonna like that one.
Also, you've been watching
the show of this one, right?
- Yeah.
-  So you know there's a book,
If You Give a Mouse a Cookie.
We just picked out a few books.
I really like this one.
We have the Ten Little Dinosaurs,
so that might be fun.
I'll Never Let You Go,
Pig the Winner looks
like a really funny, cute one.
And we love rhyming books.
Mama basically only wants to read books
that are rhyming.
(upbeat music)
All right, we've got out books, you ready?
- Yeah.
-  We got lots of books.
You wanna carry it?
- Heavy!
-  It's so heavy.
- So I heard there's a couple of boys
in this bedroom
who did a good deed today.
Is that true?
Hello?
(boys giggling)
Hey you two,
you hanging out in your little tent?
- Yeah.
- Doin' some campin' in your room?
Ollie, did you and Finn
give some books away today?
- Yeah.
-  That is so cool.
To the library?
- Mm-hmm.
- That's so neat, dude.
Now all those kids who use the library
to get books can go there
are read yours now, huh?
- Yeah.
- That's pretty neat.
I love that the boys are involved
with little giving practice like that
around the city.
We're always donating
toys or clothes or books.
I think it's really
good for them. (laughs)
They also got a handful
of new books, didn't you?
We should read some new
books tonight for bed!
Luna, you gonna be here for reading time?
You ready for book time?
- Wait, smell her, guys.
-  Does she smell good?
- Yeah.
-  Ooh, give her a smell.
- She smells very good.
- Ooh, she does smell good.
I think she got a bath, didn't you?
-  Yes, she did.
-  Did you get a bath?
She's a spoiled little puppy.
(peaceful music)
- Miss Tracy haves this.
-  Do you have that book at school?
- It's about, it has about these one
and same as this one.
-  That's so cool,
what's that story about?
- It's about if you give a mouse a cookie.
-  What do they need
if you give them a cookie?
- He wants a glass of milk.
-  Of course he does! (laughs)
Such a cute book, I used
to read this all the time.
Oh, look at all the
different ones they have.
- If you give a cat a --
-  A cupcake.
- A cupcake.
-  Yeah, that's cute.
So you read all of 'em in school?
- Yeah.
- That's so cool.
(babbling)
Is Luna giving you kisses, Finn?
I am so proud of you boys
for choosing some books to give away.
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.
