-  Good Morning!
♪ Sure is a good life ♪
♪ Let's live it ♪
♪ Live it forever ♪
- Hey boys! You guys have to see
their shirts I put them in this morning.
They are so cute.
Stand up boys, let us see.
It says Fuzzy and Fearless.
And you've got Chewbacca.
- Yeah, this is from Star Wars.
-  That's so cool.
I saw those shirts and I just
had to get 'em for your guys.
Do you know why?
- Why?
- Because you are fuzzy and fearless!
My boys are so brave, huh?
- Yeah.
- Do you boys know what it is today?
- What?
- Yes?
- It's Saint Patrick's Day.
- Yay!
- Do you know guys know what
happens on Saint Patrick's Day?
- What?
-  You really gotta
be careful because there
could be leprechauns
running around, right?
- Yeah.
- And I've heard leprechauns are some of
the most craziest little
misfits, and they will turn
your house upside-down, right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so we have this
handy-dandy book called,
How to Catch a Leprechaun.
- Yep, leprechauns are bad.
-  They are.
- But why are they bad?
- Cause they like gold.
They like to terrorize and hunt for gold.
Finn, what do you think
about the leprechauns,
do you think we'll run into one today?
(mumbles)
-  Yeah, do you think
we'll run into one today, Ollie?
- I think so.
-  Yeah, well, do
you want to read this book
and figure out how to catch a leprechaun?
- Yep!
- Okay.
Let's read it.
- Those are shamrocks, but they're also
called flowers too, guys.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.
I am learning so much Saint
Patrick's Day stuff already.
The night is dark, the streets are quiet,
Saint Patricks's Day is near.
I tap my hammer so you'll
know the leprechaun is here.
The leprechaun's coming.
I'll pull out all your laces,
put glitter in your hair.
And when you walk around,
you'll find my gold coins everywhere.
-  There's a gold coin.
-  I know, the leprechauns
are taking over the house,
huh?
- Yeah.
- Bryan] I know you want my pot of gold,
that iron case was clever.
But I've been alive 200 years.
You won't catch me, ever!
Look it, the leprechaun put
that little boy in a cage.
- Oh.
-  We can't let
him do that to you guys.
- No.
I'm strong, so I can fight leprechauns.
- Yeah, well they are
not that very strong,
but they're really, really fast, huh?
- Yeah.
That is so cool, you guys;
How to Catch a Leprechaun.
Do you think that we can
actually have a leprechaun
in this house today?
- And I think we should make
a cake that we got yesterday.
- Oh, the Christmas Cage?
-  Yeah.
- We could also try, I
have something, gold coins.
Should we put out some gold coins?
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I found these gold
doubloons just lying around.
And I figured maybe can set
them somewhere and we should
use them to see if we can trap one.
Alright boys, I'm gonna
set these gold coins
right on top of this wooden
log, and we will see if
anything comes by and steals them, kay?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
My wife is so cute, you guys.
Lookit, she left me a little
note on my office door,
that says today's going to be a good day!
- It's going to be Patrick's Day.
-  Yep, but it's also
going to be a good day, right?
- Yep.
- Alright, let's put those gold coins
on the table right there too.
- Yeah.
- Cause it seems like
a good height for a leprechaun, right?
- Yeah.
- We'll see if we got one.
Okay, come on, I got something
fun for you guys to do.
- Alright.
-  We've got tattoos!
So go ahead and pick a
Saint Patrick's Day tattoo.
We've got some cute ones.
That one says Shenanigans.
-  I want the rainbow one.
-  Kiss me, I'm Irish.
Oooh, you want the rainbow one?
-  Yeah.
- Which one do you want, Finn?
(mumbles)
Oh, you want the hat?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, that'd be cool.
Alright, let's count, you ready?
- One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.

That is some good counting, Ollie.
He can do one through 10 now.
He gets close to like 13-14,
I think that's pretty neat, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, okay.
Let's see, Oh, I see it already coming.
Whoa!
- Wooo!
-  That is so cool, do you like it?
- Yeah.
Yeah, are you ready, Finn?
- Yeah.
-  Alright and here
is Mr. Finnegan's, woohoo!
Alright, Finny really
wanted one on his cheek.
Oh, he looks so cute.
Don't touch it, don't touch it.
(laughs) He always wants
to touch it afterwards.
- Take it off!
-  Alright.
Whoa!
You got a horseshoe
and a bunch of shamrocks,
that looks so good.
Alright, time to see daddy's.
You ready?
- Yeah.
Check it out.
I got a shamrock, what do you think?
- Good.
- Is that pretty cool?
- Yeah.
- Now I'm cool like you guys.
(Finn mumbling)
(Bryan laughing)
(upbeat music)
(playful irish music)
All right, boys!
Let's go check on our coins
and see if anything got 'em.
-  Okay!
-  Do you think
they're still there?
- No.
- Yeah!
- Okay, let's go check and see
if our coins are still there.
Come on!
We know we left some over
here on the table, right?
(Ollie gasps)
- Where did they go?
-  Oh, they're gone?
- What!
-  Do you think he
came in here and grabbed them?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, well let's
go check your bedroom.
Go check your bedroom, Finn.
- Let's find 'em!
-  Let's go see
if we can find the coins
in your bedroom still.
(upbeat irish music)
- What!
-  What, they're gone?
- What, yeah!
- Whoa!
Ollie, I don't how to say
this: but we may actually
have a leprechaun loose in the house.
- Really?
- We may have to trap this thing.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
That's crazy!
While we were getting
temporary tattoos apparently,
leprechaun came in and
started some mischief.
I bet he's running around
else in the house, huh?
- Yeah!
-  I think I just heard something
inside the bathroom, Ollie.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You should go and investigate.
Finn, you wanna investigate?
- Come with me.
- I'll come with you, okay.
- Yeah.
- Okay, go ahead.
Open up the door.
I think I hear something.
(knocking)
There you go. (laughs)
Did you guys hear the leprechaun in there?
-  Yeah.
- Well, let's go see if
he did anything, go see.
It's okay, it's okay.
Ollie's like legit scared
of this leprechaun.
Anything out of the ordinary?
- Oh!
See if he left you anything.
What is it?
- What?
-  Whoa!
- Whoa, A rainbow!
-  There's a rainbow,
and the water's green?
- What?
- Yeah.
-  Do you think the leprechaun
used the toilet, Ollie?
-  Yes.
(Bryan laughs)
- What did they do?
Why is it green?
- I don't know.
How did it turn green?
-  Well, I don't know.
The leprechaun must
have been in here, huh?
And look, he left you guys a
clue, it's a little rainbow.
Do you think there's
going to be more things,
if we follow the clue?
- Yeah, but what is this black thing?
-  Yeah.
- What is the black thing?
- I don't know how leprechauns work.
Kay, let's get outta here.
Smells like brimstone in here.
- Maybe that's the leprechaun smell.
- (laughs) Maybe he went potty, huh?
And then he made the
toilet green. (laughs)
- There's a leprechaun!
-  There's a
leprechaun in our house?
- Yes!
- Go get it!
Oh, he's chasing you?
Oh, no, he's chasing you!
Run from them Ollie, go,
run, run, run, run, run!
(Ollie screaming)
Get him, Finny, get him!
(screaming)
There's a real leprechaun
in our house, Ollie.
Ah!
- Come on, daddy!
-  Get him,
leprechaun, go catch him!
- This can't be a leprechaun in the house.
- Well, I think there is,
and he's coming right for us!
(all screaming)
(laughing)
-  Oh, you cute little leprechaun.
- Nice leprechaun.
- Yeah, he's a nice leprechaun.
He's a nice, cute, little
leprechaun. (laughs)
-  He can do tricks.
I think Finn can do tricks.
- Top of the mornin' to ya.
(Irish music)
Finn you're giving a new definition to
Fuzzy and Fearless in your
fuzzy slippers. (laughs)
Those are so cute.
Wait, Ollie, what's that?
Is that another rainbow?
- Yeah!
- Wait, is that just like the
one that's in the bathroom?
- Yes, in the toilet.
It's still there and now
there's one right there.
- Oh, that's --
- Let's see if there's
another one outside.
- Yeah, should we like, follow them?
What?
- Rainbows everywhere!
One right there, One right there!
-  Whoa, there
is a rainbow right here.
-  Come on this side, guys!
-  Wait, there's one over there?
Come here, Finn!
Oh, Finn's struggling
in his fuzzy slippers.
(laughs)
Alright, we got Finn in some better shoes,
that he can walk in.
There actually Ollie's shoes,
he's like really excited
about them cause they light up. (laughs)
Alright Ollie, what are we gonna do?
So you want to follow these rainbows?
- Look guys, rainbow right there!
- Whoa, do you see, Finn?
- Two of them!
Whoa!
Okay, So there's a rainbow right here.
- There's a rainbow.
-  Whoa, look at all these coins.
Do you think the leprechaun
dropped all of these?
- No.
- Wait.
-  Well, pick 'em up!
Pick up those gold doubloons!
Those are worth money, you guys.
We can get toys with those.
- Look!
- What do you see, Finn?
- More!
- Anoth, Oh wow!
There's another rainbow over here, Ollie.
I think the leprechaun may want
us to follow these rainbows.
Hey boys, do you know what's
at the end of a rainbow?
-  What?
- A pot of gold.
- A pot of gold?
- Do you think we can find a pot of gold,
if we keep following the rainbows?
- Yeah, and maybe we can
follow these coins too.
-  Yeah, let's go!
(playful music)
- Guys, look at my pot of gold.
-  Yeah, it's so cool.
Alright, we're looking
for the next rainbow,
so we know where to go next.
You're pretty good at this.
- No rainbows. (gasps)
I thought there's no rainbow over here,
but there's a rainbow right there.
Look at it, look!
-  Wow, let's go see.
Oh, wow!
There's a rainbow right here too, Ollie.
- There's a rainbow over here.
- Yeah, let's go check it out, dudes.
We are following the rainbows
on our property right now.
There has definitely
been a leprechaun afoot,
causing some mayhem.
Oh, my goodness!
What is that, Ollie?!
- A rainbow.
-  Rainbow, and what's over here?
-  Whoa!
-  What, a pot of gold?
- And look!
-  What are those?
two Buzz Lightyear new
glow-in-the-dark blasters?
-  Yeah, these
we could open these up.
-  What is that, Finn?
-  Money.
-  Is this gold?
-  Yeah.
-  Look at all of
this gold we just found.
I have never actually found a pot of gold,
at the end of a rainbow, have you, guys?
-  No.
-  No, and what did you get, Finn?
-  A toy.
-  Another rainbow?
-  Yeah.
-  Whoa!
(bubbling sounds)
- Oh, my gosh!
-  It makes noise?
- Yeah.
(laughs)
- There's so cute.
A little leprechaun must have left those
toys for you to play with together.
- Really?
Finn, grab yours, I'm
gonna snatch this gold.
- See, this is full now.
-  Yeah, that's
really full of gold, huh?
-  Yeah.
-  Look at this: This
is a real pot of gold, huh?
- Yeah.
-  So you think this
is the leprechaun's gold?
- Yeah.
- So what do you do, when
you find a pot of gold
at the end of a rainbow,
in the middle of the woods?
Do we take it?
- Yeah.
- Or do you leave it?
- You take it.
- Maybe we should take it, and if we run
into the leprechaun, we
can give him his gold back.
- Okay.
- We may have a leprechaun
problem on our hands,
if we take all of his gold though.
You understand that, right?
- But leprechauns are bad,
bad remember guys?
-  Well, they don't seem too bad.
Look, he left you guys toys,
that's pretty cool.
- Yeah.
(grunts)
- I'm going to grab this
very big pot of gold.
Okay, let's go!
You know what I could
buy with all this gold?
A lot of LaCroix.
We're out of LaCroix right now.
I'm pretty thirsty. (laughs)
That was a pretty epic
adventure, wasn't it, boys?
-  Yeah.
- Yeah, you guys got toys.
Daddy got a pot of gold.
Whoa, show me your new
glow-in-the-dark blasters, Ollie.
(bubbling sound)
-  That is so cool.
They make lots of noises,
and they light up.
(upbeat music)
Alright, Ollie's gonna
vlog, while I show you
how it works, okay?
- Okay.
So you put the little balls
right in there, just like that.
-  I think you
are just attacking daddy.
(laughs)
And then watch this, you pull
this back, you push it forward
and then you fire! (laughs)
I got you, huh Ollie?
- Yeah.
(laughs)
-  Now pull this part back, Finn.
Right here.
Can you do it, Ollie,
can you pull it back?
There you go, keep pulling.
-  Help me.
There you go, now push it back in.
There you go.
Now load it up with some balls
and then you can start shooting it, kay?
Let's see if it works.
(pop)
Whoa!
That's pretty neat, huh?
- Yeah.
- Hey Ollie, what do you
think of that blaster?
- Good.
Is that pretty fun?
- Yeah.
-  Ah, here comes Finn! (laughs)
There are so cute.
They used to have the original
Buzz Lightyear Blasters,
but they don't sell those
anymore at Disneyland, which
I completely understand,
but it was a bummer'cause
they didn't make the
Buzz Lightyear Blasters.
When I bought them Star
Wars pajamas on the website,
I saw these and I was like,
oh, I they're gonna love these.
So, I talked to the leprechaun
and let him know where
he could grab them, okay?
- Okay.
(laughs)
-  They're pretty cool, right?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
Let's see your warrior pose, Ollie.
- Okay.
And Go!
Warrior Pose!
The boys are so cute today, I love
having fun days like this
where I can just surprise them
and do fun things with.
And while I was doing it,
I got my own surprise.
Check this out.
So I was vlogging on
this camera, and I opened
up the screen, and there's a little piece
of paper right here.
It says you got this! (laughs)
Just another little encouraging note
from my amazing wife, who
I love so much. (laughs)
Thanks for all the
encouraging messages, babe.
I love you.
(upbeat music)
- Alright guys, it is time for bed.
Ollie, you were just telling me
that someone was in our house.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, a little green man
was in our house today,
wasn't he?
-  And he was playing jokes on you?
- A leprechaun.
-  A leprechaun?
And then you followed the
rainbows to a pot of gold?
- Yeah, and we saw blasters.
- I gotta say: I mean, when I
was kid, Saint Patrick's Day
was probably like the
least coolest holiday.
I mean, you got it pretty good.
You got a pretty cool holiday.
- Yeah, I think Dada was able to make
Saint Patrick's Day cool even, huh?
(laughing)
You ever ran down a
rainbow to see if there's
an actual pot of gold?
I've done it.
- Nope.
- I've hopped on my bike, and
I biked for hours probably.
-  Hours?
- Trying to find the
end of a rainbow once.
Oh yeah, I believed.
- Oh, my gosh!
Now whenever you see a rainbow,
you're gonna need to follow it
to get the pot of gold, kay?
- Yeah.
- This kid is out though.
He is so done.
He made it through one book,
and he was like done; I'm out.
Anyways, we're going to go to bed.
Make sure you give a big thumbs
up for all the leprechauns
and Saint Patrick's Day.
- And let us know
if you had a leprechaun
living in your house,
what would you name him?
- You should name him Spicy.
(laughs)
- That's actually a pretty good
- That's pretty good.
leprechaun name. (laughs)
We will see you guys tomorrow,
and what do you say, Ollie?
- Bye!
Boop.
(upbeat music)
