- I just made the stupidest mistake.
We just put in this new concrete.
I came over here earlier,
and I felt the water in the pool,
and I was like, oh,
yeah, feels pretty good.
I'm going to put some swim shorts on.
And then I came walking
back and this is what I see.
(whimsical music)
My footprints, ladies and
gentlemen, my footprints.
♫ This is our life, this is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream, this is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life let's live it
♫ Live it forever
- Morning.
- Morning.
-  Morning, boys.
You look comfy.
- I'm Batman.
-  You're Batman?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- He's Spiderman.
- Good morning, guys.
(bell ringing)
This morning I am hanging
out with both of my boys.
You had no school today?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you didn't either?
Finn really wants to
go to school, you guys.
Whenever we go pick up Ollie,
he always runs in there and
starts playing with everyone.
But anyway, good morning, guys.
It is--
(Finn babbling)
Oh, really?
Disneyland?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I definitely
heard Disneyland, I think.
- Hey Finn, we're going
to Disneyland later!
- We're going to go later, okay?
(Bryan laughing)
It's so fun in the morning with the boys
because I love waking up and
just turning on cartoons,
and then I normally get like an extra 15,
20 minutes of sleep and
I can hear the cartoons,
and I wake up to them,
and they're just so happy.
We actually have Rugrats
on the screen right now,
which the boys have never watched before,
but I used to watch this
all the time as a kid.
I actually remember seeing this movie
in the theaters with my Grandma.
Yeah, it's so funny seeing the kids
watch things that you
used to watch as a kid.
Now my little rugrats
are watching Rugrats,
I used to watch Rugrats,
it's just a cool thing.
Morning cartoons, huh?
I love you boys.
- Good morning, guys!
I am getting the boys ready for the day
because, as you can see,
Oliver is dressed as a hamper.
There he is!
He is not dressed.
Finn and Ollie are still in their pajamas,
but it is definitely time to get dressed,
so I've got to pick them out outfits,
and you know what?
As you can see, it's a
little bit of a chilly day.
I'm going to go ahead and get them
dressed into warmer
clothes, which, actually,
this looks way to small for Ollie.
All right, it's time to
get this one ready now.
I'll show you what we picked
out for Ollie in a minute,
but now it's time for
this guy to get ready.
He has got crazy bed hair.
I'm a little bummed right now,
because as you guys may know,
Finn has been a master at
getting out of his crib.
Even before Ollie helped
him out of the crib,
he was getting out of the crib
because we put it at the lowest setting
and he could just climb out.
So, in order to avoid
anything too drastic,
we were able to put his
mattress on the floor.
So now, it's even lower
than the lowest setting.
It's sitting on the floor,
and it has kept him in
his crib for months now.
It's definitely got me
a little bit extra time,
because I needed it, in
order to keep him in a crib,
because he is definitely
too little to be in a bed,
at least, in my opinion, for
Finn, like Finn's personality,
it would just be kind of crazy
if I put him in a bed this early.
But unfortunately, I
put him down for a nap
and he can now climb out
even with this mattress
all the way on the floor.
And I am so bummed, so, so bummed.
I don't know what I'm
going to do at this point.
Nap time is usually harder cause
he doesn't want to go to sleep,
but he usually goes right to bed,
but now that he can climb out,
he's just going to climb out.
Bed time, he's usually tired
and he'll just lay down
and he hopefully won't try,
but now that he knows he
can climb out, I'm worried.
Definitely worried that he's just going to
start climbing out of his crib.
So I don't know what we're going to do,
I don't know if it's time we
actually do put him in a bed,
I just think that would be
really difficult right now,
but we'll see.
I'm really sad that he can climb out now.
So, he's going to skip his nap today
because we've got a busy day.
He's going to get no nap.
He'll probably sleep in the car, actually.
We'll see how tonight goes.
And here they are, all
dressed and looking snazzy.
You got your hair done,
you got your hair done,
we've got a sweater
for Finn, and we've got
a long-lined shirt and then
just nice jacket for him,
and his cool pants and, of
course, his light up shoes.
Pretty cool, huh?
And Finn, he's got a sweater, long pants,
and we've still got to
put your shoes on, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
(Missy giggling)
Alright, you guys ready to go have fun?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Okay.
We are out and about.
It's actually nice.
I don't know if we've
done a lot of errands
all together as a family.
Bryan's been working so much lately.
- Yeah.
- But I did want to tell you guys that
me and Kelsey worked out again today,
and it was so painful and so intense
that we both felt like we
were going to throw up,
and now I am in so much pain,
and we worked out this morning,
so you know tomorrow's
going to be way worse,
after you rest and sleep
you usually wake up
and you're just like, Ow, ow, ow,
but I'm still, like,
It's been hours since the workout,
and I'm still shaky a little,
when I go to sit or stuff.
But it's good, it's good.
I feel good when I hurt, because I'm like,
at least all that pain was for something,
instead of when I don't
have any pain, I'm like,
what'd I do wrong?
Did I not work hard enough?
I think it's all good.
I don't feel like we're hurting ourselves
or damaging ourselves.
All we're doing is just building
muscle, and it's been good.
It's been fun to have someone
to go with and workout with,
and we're kind of at the same exact level,
which is really, really cool.
I don't feel like either of us
are way ahead or way behind,
or whatever, so that's been really fun.
But anyways, we've gotta
go to the grocery store.
You ready to go to the grocery store?
- Hey Finny, where's your belly button?
Do you guys remember when Ollie did this?
He knew where his belly
button is, he's so happy.
Finn and I are going to
grab a couple of things
because I am having a guys' poker night
-  Ow, no, no, no.
- at my house this week.
I need to get stuff to cook.
What?
What do you see?
Do you want to get a card for mama?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?
Which card do you want to get, Finn?
- Batman.
-  Batman?
This one?
Whoa, that's so cool.
Look at this one, Finn.
Open it!
(music playing from card)
Wow, that's so cool!
It's playing music?
He's so happy.
You love Batman?
- I love Batman.
- Karma's under me.
-  He's under you?
- Yeah.
-  Karma.
-  He's keeping your feet warm.
-  What do we got going here?
Little homework time?
- Yeah, homework, from his teacher.
-  That's so cool, Ollie.
- Yeah, I'm still really excited
about the fact that he can write H.
-  Yeah.
- And so I'm going to have
him write a million H's.
-  Yay.
What are these books?
It Smells?
-  So this one
is My Little Journal,
and he can write his name
and draw a little picture.
-  It says my amazing body.
- Yeah.
-  You think so highly of yourself.
- I know how to open the crayons.
-  And then it's got
letters that he can draw,
-  Oh, cool.
- Numbers--
-  That is so cool.
- Basically all the stuff that they've
been working on at school.
- Yeah, neat.
Ollie, you get to draw
a picture of yourself.
- I need to find red.
- Okay, you get red.
-  Yeah.
- Is this red?
- Yeah, that's red.
- Okay, but how I do it?
-  You could draw
any kind of picture.
- He's so cute.
- You could draw a picture of you,
you could draw a picture of mommy,
- Wait, I can't do eyes.
- You can do it, I'll
help you with the eyes.
Here, draw a circle
first, to make your head.
- This is the like the beginning
of the rest of our life,
babe, you understand that, right?
-  Yep.
-  Homework.
- Here's the circle!
Good job!
Alright, do you want me
to help you do the eyes?
- Mm-hmm.
- So the eyes are so easy.
- Missy and I were just
talking the other day
about how we think homework is so lame
that you have to go to
school, and then you have to
come home and do more school,
and now I think she's kind
of loving having this time.
Ollie's first homework, it's cute.
- I think it's fun when
you're really involved,
and you're a part of their education,
but I think as they get
older, I think it can be
really overwhelming when a
child spends all day at school
and then comes home and then
has to spend their time,
which they should be
spending with their family,
which is great education right there,
in how to be a normal human being in life
and how to function inside a family,
but instead they're spending
their time doing homework
and sometimes hours of homework.
-  Yeah.
- I don't know, I definitely
have interesting views
when it comes to that stuff.
This, I think is nice
because I think it's a great
bonding experience right here,
and I get to be a part of
his education, which is nice.
-  Yeah.
- Mama, what does the back do?
- So that's an eraser.
You can erase if you don't
like the way something looks.
-  Isn't that cool?
- So if you're like,
that was a really good smile, by the way,
you did that all by yourself.
- He did that smile all by himself?
- Yeah.
-  Dude, you're so good.
That is a good looking smile, bro.
Can you show me your smile?
- There it is!
Oh, we should do your nose, okay?
(playful music)
-  He's doing 1's.
- Good job.
That was good!
Good, good, good!
Do this side.
-  He has to do both hands.
It's interesting, and then he like,
cause like,
- Good job!
- He's kind of gripping it like a gorilla.
That's cute.
- Keep going, keep going!
-  You're doing so good, dude.
Babe, this is like the rest of our life.
- I know.
-  It's crazy, his
education is just getting started.
- Good job, keep going!
Those are such good 1's.
-  Ollie, that's
really impressive, buddy.
-  I'm so proud of you.
Can you do it without the dots now?
-  Mm-hmm.
- Can you do another one?
Good job.
- Good job, buddy.
This is really cool to
get to see my son do this.
I'm getting kind of emotional,
how about you, Karma?
- All right, you want
to try this book now?
- Mm-hmm, just don't knock over that.
-  He really wants his
Oliver Who Traveled Far and Wide book
to be standing up.
- Okay, we'll put that there.
All right, you gotta
put your name on here.
(playful music)
Oh, hey!
You light up when I turn
this camera on, huh?
She's like, Okay, I'm
ready for the camera!
We have been running
around like crazy all day
and so the house is a mess.
Look at this.
It's a mess, but we are home now,
and June's over, and Corbin and Kelsey
- We're mooching internet!
(Missy laughing)
- Corbin and Kelsey are
trying to get some work done
because they have no internet.
- We still don't have internet,
we still don't have our furniture--
- They're literally toughing it out, guys.
This has been kind of
a crazy month for them,
and I feel so bad, but it's almost over,
and you're almost going
to have your stuff,
and your house is going
to be all put together
and it's going to be great.
- It's gonna be really nice.
- And I like the extra time.
Extra cuddles with June.
She gets to come over and hang out.
She's like, Yeah, I like it too.
Finn, are you playing
baby June some music?
- Here, I'll do it.
-  Aww, these
boys love baby June, huh?
Aww.
(Missy laughing)
(Missy laughing)
He always just randomly gives her kisses
and it is the cutest thing ever.
And look how good she is, just sitting up.
- June, you are beautiful.
-  She is beautiful, huh?
Do you want to give her a kiss?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, go ahead.
-  And Finn also
brought you a diaper.
-  Yep, he's like You
might need a diaper change.
-  Finn, go ahead, it's your turn.
-  Do you want
to change her diaper?
Look at him.
He's like, I think it goes on like this.
-  He's like, excuse me.
-  So cute.
She's doing so good.
She's officially sitting up.
Oh, and there's the wipes,
because you need those, of course.
You guys are so cute.
Is that to clean her bottom?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.
- Okay, you guys, I just
made the stupidest mistake.
I feel like such an idiot,
and honestly I'm a little
embarrassed to tell you guys.
Okay, here's the sitch.
You guys remember the
big hole that was here?
Well, they just put in this
new concrete, in this square,
so they had to fix it,
then pour the concrete,
and then paint the concrete,
and it's been sitting there.
And it has this stuff on
it to make it that color.
So, I came over here earlier.
Look, you can even see my footprints.
I came over here earlier, and
I felt the water in the pool,
and I was like, Oh
yeah, feels pretty good.
I'm going to put some swim shorts on
and jump in the pool for a little bit.
And then I came walking
back, and this is what I see.
(whimsical music)
My footprints, ladies and
gentlemen, my footprints.
It's like following the scene of a crime.
Oh, my gosh.
Yes, not only did I walk
all across this patio,
I went inside the house.
(Bryan laughing)
Oh, is that not the stupidest
thing you ever heard?
I feel like an idiot
and a half, basically.
So yeah, we have a,
look at that, into the closet.
So, I have a carpet cleaner.
I'm scrubbing it and I'm
hoping that it gets it out
and I don't even have to
tell Missy this story,
but if she is watching this on the vlog,
and I didn't tell her, surprise!
Trying, you guys.
We were the idiots who
decided to get white carpet.
- All right, the kids are in bed, yay!
They were so tired today, and like I said,
Finn did not get a nap,
so he was extra exhausted,
which worked in my favor,
because he laid right down
and went right to sleep and didn't try
climbing out of his crib tonight,
so that was really nice,
but of course, he's going
to be up bright and early,
climb right out of his bed
and climb right into mine,
so that should be fun.
We are going to go ahead and end the vlog.
I'm watching the Big
Brother finale right now,
so I'm super excited.
I can't wait to find out who won.
Don't tell me in the comments, though,
because I don't know
if I'm going to be able
to finish it tonight,
so I want to be surprised,
and I'm going to watch it tomorrow.
Maybe I'll finish it tomorrow.
I don't want any of them to win.
I'm not a fan of any of them,
if you guys watch Big Brother,
but I do think Paul is
going to win because
he seems to have played the best game.
Corbin's still here editing.
He's still trying to get work done.
- Yeah, editing our pancake challenge.
- Yeah, make sure you guys go check out
their pancake challenge,
because it was really, really fun
and I'm about to judge it right now.
- You guys inspired us, like that
hamburger that you guys made?
You guys', that was insane.
- Yeah, no, we love doing the pancake art.
It was really fun.
So they did it, and then I'm
about to tell them who won,
so make sure you go watch their
channel, and go subscribe,
and then you can find out who
won because I'm the judge.
You guys can leave in the
comments on their channel
who you think won.
Give this video a big
thumbs up if you enjoyed it,
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.
-  Bye.
-  Bye.
-  Doo-doop.
(upbeat music)
