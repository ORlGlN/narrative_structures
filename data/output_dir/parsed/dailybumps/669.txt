60p oh whoa good job ollie
beep-beep-beep
he's eating the steering well good
morning guys today we are doing a little
bit of home-improvement stuff easy
home-improvement stuff though as you
guys know we had all the cabinets in our
master bathroom and our kitchen
resurfaced so that there's this really
nice like antique white color but they
still have all the old hardware on it
and the house sort of has a theme of
like the oil rubbed bronze hardware so
we went to Lowe's yesterday got a ton of
the bars and a ton of the knobs the
knobs are really cool-looking they're
like they got a little braid on the side
and they're that nice bronze color and
we got these handles to go with them but
as you can tell by putting this handle
up to this one we got the wrong size
there was like three different sizes we
were so afraid we're gonna get the wrong
one and we did so now I have to return
almost 40 handles and get a smaller size
under my measurement before I go out
this time you boys are so funny you're
pushing Finn I think he likes it do you
like it Finn you guys are so cute
say good morning okay slow down you're
going too fast you got to be easy on
them kay he's your little brother your
big brother you're responsible for him
kay I have money so I am making a
pulled-pork this mornin well not quite
this morning it's probably gonna take
about 8 to 10 hours and then a big big
big one but we're gonna make pulled pork
today hopefully we can hunt at least for
dinner I'm starting it a little bit late
it would have been nice to have like for
lunch and like munch on all day but I
think I started a little too late but I
just kind of mixed up a little bit of a
dry rub and I can
I just winged it I basically just like
put like garlic powder onion powder
paprika salt pepper mixed it all
together and then gave it a nice little
massage I'm just gonna stick it into the
slow cooker and hopefully it cooks up
and then we've got something having a
little barbecue sauce here it's called
sticky sweet and it smells really really
sweet so I think it'll be good and put
it in hopefully we get some pulled pork
later that sound good you want some
pulled pork
headed into the Home Depot to look at
knobs and handles for the house fun
stuff alright so we have a lot of
projects going on today so I can't wait
to show you guys everything that we're
doing but right now I just put Finn into
his very first Walker which we did this
with oli because number one thin pretty
much climbs and crawls on everything and
he also falls on everything and so he's
just getting hurt constantly so I need
somewhere to put him but he's not happy
and like a bouncer he's not happy to
play penny needs something where he
feels like he can get somewhere so I
know walkers can be a little
controversial but it works with us with
ollie so we're doing it with Finn and
he's already so much happier he can
touch and so he's kind of already like
moving around just kind of like scooting
back and forth so I think once he gets
the hang of it he's gonna love it
aren't you Finn and you got it all
you're just beeping yeah cuz mama is
busy today and we need you to be happy
okay look at that
that's from him falling he's got so many
marks on right now from falling it's
crazy
well that was a fail apparently they
only sell the 96 millimeter sizes online
so I'm not going to get anything here
look who's home welcome home hashtag
she's been hanging out with my parents
for the past couple weeks or so since
we're on vacation and stuff they came
back and they brought me this cool new
tank for hashtag we are putting it
together right now so it's actually
aquaponics fish tanks so I can actually
grow like little plants up here they
feed the fish and then there's a hoops
and feeds the point freezes plan I'm
sure I sold to feed the fish though
right you still feed the fish plants
clean the water the fish feed the plant
okay so it like helps keep the water
clean with the plan so he's moving too
so we moved to
the house he's moving to a new house and
I think not only that but it's actually
way prettier like it's so cute to have
see like that hanging out in your
kitchen all right we've got his tank
all's ready and we are ready to put him
in it hi shiny I'm gonna try not to like
drop you on the counter this time okay
oh nice you into the wild
whoo what do you think of that yeah it's
pretty cool yeah it was happy so we just
laid the grow bed into it and then we
put the tube and now it's going to fill
with water and that's how it's going to
feed the plants all right so we put all
the pots in here with their little gross
stones which apparently I think the
plants just grow right on top of the
stones right so it doesn't need any jerk
it just grows in the stones uh-huh I now
had to put this bottle all over him next
up on the list was actually a run - bye
bye baby we looked at this monitor
yesterday had an associate bring it up
to the front and then forgot to grab it
when we checked out so he still had not
been monitored but I picked it up leave
it now all right
Holly what are you doing you're gonna go
catch a stink bug all right Papa got him
a big old net a better one than usual we
usually get the ones from the dollar
store and it's like really tiny this one
gets really big so you can catch all the
bugs kay and then he got him a little
watch so he can put the bug in here so
he can look at it all day huh yeah all
right don't how you open the watch how
do you open it how do you open it oh so
then the bug just lives in there yeah
all right let's go get you a bug kay hey
cat okay you bring that got your snacks
and you got a bug catcher and you got a
Papa who will help you catch the bugs
yeah go have fun kay so I am about to
tackle a very big project which is
Finn's room Finn we annoy your mattress
yes we do
you're way too big for that huh but yeah
Finn's gonna start really using his room
probably here soon
so I'm gonna try and get this unpack cuz
I can barely even walk to his crib right
now plus most of the stuff actually goes
in Ali's room so let's get started
you
alling what did you find
is it bug in there yeah oh there's no
bug in there but I heard you found
something while you're out there what'd
you find a snake oh you've got a snake
coming out of the horse's ended uh-huh
we're gonna do the snake you're gonna
catch a snake soon kay we have both the
kids down for a nap yay and now I'm
working on a little project that I'm not
really sure what I'm gonna do it yours
off to let me know if you have any tips
but I bought this wine
riddling rack and basically this is a
rack that normally you would like stick
wine into and then it like lit its like
upside down basically like the top is
down here and the bottoms up here the
way they displayed it on the magazine
was succulents in it the other had like
a little stuck on someone so I bought
all these little succulents and now I
don't know how the heck I'm supposed to
do it basically I shoved this succulent
down here and then it's like sticking
out here like we ripped it out of this
word it probably is but I mean
succulents are known to last like that
it could probably like survive this but
I just don't know if I'm supposed to do
that with every single one or if there's
like maybe a better idea sometimes lots
of roots I don't know half of it like
falls down here I just feel like a plant
killer
I know get in there get in there can it
survive this so I want to know people
can a plant survive living like this and
does it need to have like a planter back
here I'm kind of thinking it was fake
plants yeah we're starting to think that
maybe what we saw were fake plants it
looks so cool okay okay it couldn't last
but I doubt they will I don't want to
kill our plants yeah let me know if you
guys have any ideas for this out of a
plant and then this is the beans I'm not
gonna use it for wine this is the back
and I wanted to hang it in my bathroom
yeah I saw like you don't probably have
to build like a bigger shelf there to
hold yeah I mean we could do a bigger
shelf but like will that be okay that's
what I want to know it's like can it
just survive like this like or do you
need one of these and maybe just like
screw it in there so that it holds all
that Dirks obviously we can't dirt
hanging out yeah so plant lovers give us
some advice well I don't have the
handles for the new kitchen but I do
have all of the knobs I've been going
around
just in the kitchen area replacing all
of them I have all these ones done these
ones done still have the old silver
handles but I got to say I think these
knobs look really really cool they look
a little darker on the camera too
they're actually more of like a brown
like a penny color and I did place an
order for those handles online so shut
the wait till they count until we can
finish the rest yeah they also look
really good on this dark blue island I
definitely like the look of that Finn is
waking up in his brand-new room check it
out I just hung all of these I hung up
his name and mr. Finlay did you sleep
okay Finn is not feeling the greatest
today did you enjoy your nap in your bed
though one thing about Finn is he does
not wake up in a good mood nope he's
usually pretty pretty sad you accept
baby when you wake up oh there's that
cough all right guys we have so much
stuff done in the house sometimes you
just have to stop and have fun and relax
so we're done working in the house today
now we got the whole family over and
we're gonna hang out in the backyard and
have a bit of relaxing time
hey aunty I heard you fell down yeah
like a million times from Olli right

from Cassie's short girl video we've
been hearing about it for months now
