-  Finn just slid into
action and posed like this.
He even held his pose for me.
Wow!
Kay, do it again.
Oh, look at that!
(playing "Tribe" by Daily Bumps)
(holiday pop music)
Good morning, stinky boy!
- Keep pushing!
Ahh!
Finn's been getting his hand
stuck in this all morning.
- We have just been hanging out with Finn.
Ollie's actually at a sleepover
with Mimi and Papa today
and so Finn has just been
keeping us super busy.
-  Oh no!
Ahh!
- We're getting some final
touches done on the room
and we're just so excited for the day.
We're gonna have a fun Christmas day.
- Wanna go look at Christmas
lights today, Finn?
- Yeah!
- He's like, "Yeah!"
You like Christmas lights?
- Yeah!
- Christmas lights, Christmas cheer!
-  Luna and Karma are so funny.
They literally will just play
out here together for hours.
It's so cute.
They also both have been so dirty
because they've been kind of naughty.
And I understand, they really don't have
a lot of dog toys right now.
We haven't bought any in a long time
and I think we just threw out
the last thing that was shredded apart.
So, hopefully Santa brings
you guys some dog toys, okay?
Hi, girl.
You want some puppy toys, karma?
You too, maybe some games?
It is such a beautiful day though
and the dogs are just
playing in the backyard.
They're so cute.
I'm so glad that we got Luna, you guys.
She is such a good dog
and I think she's such
a good friend to Karma.
Karma was definitely getting lonely.
He's a social dog.
So, he likes to be social.
Hi!
The dogs just freak out
whenever I talk about them.
I gotta go back inside.
Kay go play, Luna, go play.
Go play with Karma!
So, as Missy told you guys this morning,
we are still working on
the boys shared room.
It's definitely taking some time
and it's a really big project.
And it's one that I've been, like,
designing for a really long time.
We've been thinking about it,
we've been slowly buying everything.
So, everything's like ready and today,
we've just been putting
everything in that room.
So, we're hoping we get to share that
with the boys really, really soon.
But, because Finn and Ollie
are gonna be in a room,
Finn is no longer gonna be in this room.
- I know, it's kind of sad.
I'm packing up a lot of his
little baby stuff that, like,
really when they're
sharing a room, you kind of
have to minimize a lot.
-  Yeah!
Which is also one of
the reasons I am excited
because I'm excited to,
like, have all their clothes
in one closet, you know,
have all their toys.
It's no longer Ollie's toys,
it's Ollie and Finn's toys,
you know, Ollie and Finn's books.
- Yeah, I'm really excited about it.
I think, especially with their clothes,
it'll be nice to just to,
like, minimize their clothes
because they're not
going to have a dresser.
So, I'm a little freaked out about it
but I think it's going to be good
because I think that
minimizing their clothes,
so we're just like these are the options,
will be really nice.
-  And soon they'll
be wearing the same clothes,
which is cool.
They're already wearing the same pajamas.
- They basically wear the same clothes.
-  Yeah, they
wear the same clothes,
same sizes, I mean.
So, are you, like, going through,
like, stuff we need to
get, or, like, donate?
- Yeah, so what's weird is usually
when I go through their clothes,
I usually just get rid of all
the stuff that they don't fit.
Well, now I'm not only getting
rid of stuff that they don't fit
but stuff that they do fit in still,
but I'm kind of just like,
well, we don't really wear that,
and I don't really need that, like,
we don't need all these clothes.
So, I'm getting rid of even
clothes that they fit in
which is really weird.
-  It's okay, we're
gonna give them to some kids
who need 'em which is always nice.
- And I'm gonna keep a
few for the next baby
because you never know if
it's gonna be a boy too.
-  I think we know what
the next baby is gonna be,
right guys?
- And if it is a girl then, you know,
they can wear a few boys clothes too.
-  Yeah, it's really
cool because we found
a couple of things in this room
that we want to incorporate,
and in Ollie's room, so it's kind of like
a mixture of everything which is neat.
- Yeah, and actually a
lot of Finn's room decor
actually matches which is kinda nice.
- What's really cool is not only will this
not be Finn's nursery anymore
but this is gonna be the
nursery for our next baby
when we have a baby, when we decide that.
We're kind of cleaning out
that room and picturing it.
What is this room gonna look like,
ya know, in six months, in a year?
We don't know.
It's really exciting to have,
like, cool things like
this with your family.
When things change in your family
and you get to see your
family grow and stuff.
So, it's exciting.
- We are having such a fun little day
doing some organizing with
the boys' rooms and now,
the boys are actually home.
My dad actually ended up
taking Finn to go get Ollie
and some lunch and they're almost here.
So, I'm super excited to see them.
Let's see if Ollie had
fun at Mimi and Papa's.
Ollie, did you have fun?
- Yeah!
-  I missed you!
- I missed you too.
-  Are you excited to be home?
- Yeah.
-  Cool, alright,
let's get in the house.
And look even Finn fell asleep
on his little adventure.
- Mama?
-  Yeah?
- Is my bed ready now?
- Not yet, almost though, almost, okay?
- Okay.
-  Finn wants
to show you something.
Ollie, follow Finn.
What is he doing?
(inaudible speech)
I know!
I woke up to him this
morning and he was fishing.
He's fishing for our real fish.
Isn't that so funny?
- He didn't catch one did he?
-  No, not yet,
I'm hoping he doesn't.
- That would be not good, huh?
-  I know, luckily I
don't see any bait on there
so I don't think that
they'll take the bite.
Yeah, he's just in here
fishing for our fish.
I don't know what his plan is.
What do you think he'd
do if he catches one?
- Maybe he will eat it?
- I hope not, that'd be so sad!
What if he took the fish and,
like, took it back to the North Pole?
- Maybe he would turn it in snow.
-  Turn it in snow?
- Yeah.
-  You're so funny.
Well Fred, you are a mischievous one.
We don't know what you were
trying to do with that fish
but I think they're all safe.
Maybe he was just kind of teasing us, huh?
- Yeah.
- Finn was Fred fishing
in the fishing tank?
- Yeah.
- That's silly elf on the shelf, huh?
He's trying to catch my fish.
Those are your fish too
buddy, they're are friends.
That is seriously so funny.
Fred, I don't know if
that hook's gonna work
but he better be careful because
Dude actually might bite it
and get him in the tank.
For those of you who
don't know, this is Dude.
He's our big guy.
He basically runs the tank.
Hey Fred I'm pretty sure you don't have
a fishing license to fish here.
You're gonna have to go elsewhere.
- Alright, boys...
We have been playing, oh my goodness...
We've been playing, mommy and daddy
have been basically working
on their room all day
so it's just kind been one of
those days, but guess what?
I finally have finished
peanut butter balls
and I really want the boys to
try them for the first time.
I think Ollie's gonna be a little hesitant
but of course he's gonna love
them once I make him try 'em.
Finn is going to love
them and be very excited.
Are you guys excited to
try my peanut butter balls?
- Yeah!
-  Are you?
- Yeah!
- Kay good, lemme turn
the light on, hang on.
These are what we have so far.
Now, they're not all done yet.
This is all mommy's done
done but we're gonna try one.
Have you had one of these before?
- Yeah.
-  Have you?
Mkay, show me.
Is it good?
Yay!
Oh, and he just put it right in his mouth.
You like it?
- Mhmm.
-  You were like so
nervous to try it yesterday.
You said you didn't want
one but they're good?
- Yeah.
- What have I done?
I've now probably created a monster.
He's just gonna ask me
for a peanut butter ball
every five seconds today.
But they're pretty good, right?
Mm they are so good.
Mm I actually bought tons of little tins
to put them in for gifts and stuff.
So, I think I'm gonna package
up a few and give them to,
like, Kelsey and Corbin tonight
because she helped me a
ton make these and so,
I'll probably be giving her a lot more
but I wanted to have
some, like, right away.
So, yay, I'm gonna go package
some of these up for them
and give them to 'em.
We're gonna be doing
something really fun later
and we're so excited.
Oh, where's Ollie?
Ollie's gone.
Alright, I'm gonna eat
my peanut butter ball.
Finn just slid into action
and posed like this.
He even held his pose for me, wow.
Very, very good.
Do you wanna do it again?
- Yeah.
-  Kay do it again.
Oh, look at that.
Oh and look at Ollie's pose.
You guys are so cute.
Alright I just got these packaged up.
I got these cute little containers
and it says Merry Christmas
and then I put to K and C from M and B.
I think I'm actually gonna cut it
because I think I want you
to be able to see inside,
those peanut butter balls.
And there we have them.
Look how delicious those look.
I was actually debating,
like, maybe wrapping them
in a little bit of,
like, ribbon around them
but I think they're going to want
to get into them pretty quickly.
Oh, and Ollie is still
showing us his moves.
Very cool, dude.
We are on our way to see
some Christmas lights
and our boys even got their hats on!
Nice hat, Ollie.
Nice hat, Finn.
Missy's even got a hat.
Where's my hat?
I'm rockin' this jingle
bells light up necklace
which is actually pretty cool.
What?
(unintelligible speech)
- He says, where's my hat.
-  Where's your hat, huh?
Oh, where's your shoes.
-  Where's your
shoes and how come he can't
keep 'em on for more than ten minutes.
- I checked the forecast and it says that
there was a zero percent chance of rain.
-  And what's it doing right now?
- Well, I think someone left
the sprinklers on, okay?
-  It's raining, it's raining.
- It's sprinkling, it's misting.
- It's just raining a little bit.
-  I know.
We have found the Christmas lights!
There so cool, huh?
- Yeah!
-  Do you remember
doing this last year, buddy?
Whoa, that's so cool, huh?
(unintelligible speech)
Yeah!
So, this is Bainbridge Lane.
It's like a famous road
in our area where they all
do Christmas lights that are
animated and move to music.
Hey Finn, look what's he doing?
He's riding in the carrier.
- Yeah, he's like, get me out.
-  Yeah, he's like what is this?
I am an adult, excuse me.
-  See all the lights?
-  Aren't the cool?
Say Christmas!
-  Oh look, Santa's
looking at us right now!
-  There's Santa!
He's checking to see if you've been nice!
(pop music)
-  Hey Ollie, look
who's up on this house!
Who is that?
- Yeah!
-  Jack Skellington!
- Yeah, and look at his..
- And his dog, Zero.
- Yeah!
-  That's so cool!
They have a five days til
Christmas countdown even.
- It's gonna be confusing for Finn
when he calls Christmas Halloween.
-  I know.
(holiday pop music)
Whoa, yes, stomp your feet, bro.
And dance!
(laughter)
(holiday pop music)
- They have the Christmas lights.
-  They were so pretty, huh?
- Yeah!
-  What did you think, Finn?
Was that fun?
Yeah.
Look how tired they are.
I think we tired them out, babe.
We did it, we finally did it.
Yes, Bainbridge Falls was amazing.
It's so fun to do every single year.
It's just a really great experience
I feel like for Christmas.
- And it's one of our traditions now.
-  Yeah, it totally is.
-  We've been doing it for a while.
- Yeah I think we're on like
six years now, doing that.
So, definitely a fun night.
Let us know down below in the comments,
do you guys go out and
look at Christmas lights?
Do you, like, go visit a certain place?
Do you kinda just, like, drive around?
Some people walk around if
they're in a good neighborhood.
Throw the kids in a cart, walk around,
which is always really fun.
But anyway, I think that's
all for today's blog.
If you enjoyed it, be sure
to give it a big thumbs up.
Ollie's giving it a sleepy thumbs up.
Thumbs up, Finn!
He's tired.
Okay, thanks for watching today's video.
We'll see you manana.
Bye!
