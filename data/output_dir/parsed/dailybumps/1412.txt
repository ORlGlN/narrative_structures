tired afterwards yeah this big ol like
notable hippo in the house so cute look
at that crawl babe he's on his knees oh

hi kitty
oh hi Candis old friend Edie was
sleeping
getting your nap on your cat nap on I
love this cat though I love it from afar
that's like blow all the hair because
this is one hairy cat even if we brushed
in once and got like three other cats
and it still is just insane you are a
hairy cabbie you are a pretty cat and I
love you still just don't go in my room
it's lunchtime yeah we're having
butternut squash and applesauce sounds
delicious you don't try it
mmm anti smiling eyes over there karma
goes way outside right now Ali do you
like it hi karma Ali karmis Ali mmm he
doesn't seem to be a big fan
ah see I knew you liked okay I was
looking at the camera and I totally
missed your face okay mmm you like it
huh Oh karma wants them so yeah I like
it
huh yeah yeah mmm no you can't have any
so I started feeding all over these
little snackies right before we left for
playlist just to give them something to
you know munch on and stuff and these
are by
Ella's kitchen and they're kind of like
the puffs that you can give your kids
that dissolve I don't think these
dissolve or anything but I really like
the ingredients most ingredients were
you know pretty pretty normal
ingredients nothing too crazy
um but Oliver is just learning to feed
himself it's like the cutest thing
sometimes he bites his finger dance
hilarious but he feel he can do it oh
good job
No Oh sometimes it takes a couple tries
oh did it again yay you just started
doing that life last night so cute why
can't do it he had not been able to feed
himself
owl and these things literally taste
like nothing like I think we tried him
they're supposed to be like raspberry
and vanilla or something like that and
they taste like nothing at all but he
likes em he thinks they're pretty good
not that one
oh yeah no when he keeps doing it with
his bright what see anything right now
he's using his left right now but he's
been using his right I'm right-handed
Brian's right Hannah but my sister she's
kind of ambidextrous she can use both
her hands no I ride with my left hand
but I do sports tonight she does she
rides with her left hand but that's
almost cuz her teacher made her choose a
hand and she like chose her left and we
don't think she'd left handed and then
she does everything else with her right
so so she kind of does everything and my
brother does that too so maybe he'll be
a man dextrous morrow we're getting our
brand-new big whole huge bed right now
oh we have a queen so one you instead -
they're like in the stores they look
small cuz we were like on the California
keen I'm like a fan yeah but uh when you
bring it home it's like huge yeah yeah
and I think we've always I know I don't
think that we're prepared for the king
we've always slept on a queen I think I
never really was like well there's no
reason to get a king then we have kids I
was like oh sorry I was like well one
day they might want to like sleep with
us and start we just decided on a king
but I definitely don't think the king is
gonna be able to sit on this wall
because we obviously need to
sans and without where there's really no
no room for bed there she actually
bought this vacuum here a few weeks ago
and I just vacuumed with it and it's
like seriously awesome
I actually don't do most of the
vacuuming Brian vacuums a lot he's kind
of weird about that coming um but yeah
he vacuums all the time and so I haven't
really gotten a chance to use it and
it's seriously awesome it's the Hoover
Elite rewind and it's the pet edition
and it like gets all the pet hair up
it's seriously awesome and this is -
this is like the best feature okay ready
so you just push that there it is this

this spot we got our old bed out they're
gonna take our mattresses tomorrow
they're gonna set the new bed for us
when they deliver it which is really
nice and then this ability I throw my
computer desk which in fact we're gonna
get rid of this and I'm gonna actually
make my own computer desk that fits
under that table it's a little wider so
I can actually have my desktop and my
laptop on it so that should be a little
nicer for this guy it is relaxing in the
tub he's just laying there are you good

got off the phone with a lead that we
had toward another family member that
could connect me with my dad and it was
his brother's wife I basically told her
everything and she was just like wow

helpful very very nice and she basically
said you know I'm gonna have a family
meeting with his brothers and just
talking and see what happens next I
think I was I mean was I clear enough
about like I basically told her like I
don't I don't want his money I don't
need to like it relationship with him I
don't want like I don't need anything
from him I just want to see everything
that you made it very clear to like we
don't want you like going to him and
being like do you have a son yeah and we
just want to be like super like chill
about this and not like go crazy but
anyway that was exciting I didn't expect
there to be another thing happen today
regarding that but I'm I'm really happy
and she saved my number and I have her
number and it's a cell phone and I'm
just
kind of I don't know it's it's really
weird for me you know I'd be lying if I
