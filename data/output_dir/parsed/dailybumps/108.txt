- Hey Ollie, who told you

You silly kiddo.
(chuckles)
He always says Papa.

- Good morning!
We are just waking up right now.
Finn fell asleep in his
clothes last night, didn't you?
- Yeah.
- Come on guys?
-  What are we doing right now?
- We're gonna find Fred!
- We gotta find Fred.
Every morning, we gotta Fred.
The kids drag me out of bed
to go find Fred bright and early.
So let's go do it.
Let's look for him.
Where is he, where is he, where is he?
(gasps)
Where is he?
- Skittles!
-  Oh, Fred what
did you get into today?
Or last night?
Was he getting into a bag of Skittles?
Maybe he was watching a movie.
Finn, you have placed
yourself in a very scary place
because you're right on the coffee table.
Right in Finn's reach, aren't ya.
So yeah, I'm pretty sure
he was eating Skittles
and he got them all over our table.
Being a little mischievous a little early,
don't you think Fred?
He's already making messes.
Well, I think that you guys
can eat some of the Skittles.
Maybe one Skittle cause we
haven't had breakfast yet.
One Skittle.
(gasps)
How many was that?
Alright, Fred.
I'm gonna have to keep
a very close eye on you
so you don't get hurt by this little one.
You're not gonna touch him right?
No way Jose.
Do not touch him, kay?
- Kay.
- You'll get in big
trouble if you touch him
and Fred gets owies.
Alright, be careful there Fred.
Thanks for all the candy.
Today has been a crazy morning.
We've been trying to
get ready for the day.
Look at this.
I got this side kinda done
and this side not at all done.
It's actually still wet.
It's just been crazy!
But this morning we were eating breakfast
and literally magic happened.
Fred was just sitting here
with his Skittles everywhere
and in a bag and he just disappeared.
And Ollie was so sad.
And then we found him up here.
I think he needed another
safe area to hang out
cause he knew that Finn was
probably gonna touch him
and hurt him
and that would not be good,
but now the boys are all hanging out.
What do you see Finn?
-  He literally
just pulled me over here
cause there's a lizard.
The dogs are going crazy right now.
- A lizard!
-  A lizard!
There he is.
He's actually a pretty big guy
and the dogs are freaking out.
Where are they?
Come and get it.
Come and get it.
Come and get it.
-  Go Finn, go!
You dropped your St. Bernard!
Finn!
You dropped your St. Bernard!
Look at him go.
He is so obsessed with his bike.
Go, go, go, go, go!
Even in the office.
Go, go, go, go, go!
Come this way!
Come get your doggy!
- No!
(chuckles)
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Alright, Ollie.
I think it's time to give a dog a bone.
What do you think?
Karma has been wanting to play
with this pink bone all day.
Let's go outside, go.
Go, go, go, go.
What up guys?
It is a beautiful day.
It's actually starting to get cold now.
It's starting to feel a
little more Christmasy.
Yeah, how's it feel out here, dude?
- Good.
-  Good, huh.
Karma, you know that's
actually Luna's bone.
Did you ask her permission
if you could play with it?
That's the bone we got
her on her birthday.
- I like your Christmas tree, dadda.
-  Well, thank you.
I like this Christmas tree, too.
Do you know what kind of tree this is?
- What?
-  It's a Juniper tree.
- Juniper tree?
-  Yeah, just like Kelsey
and Corban's Juniper, huh.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Alright, Ollie tell me
what did Fred do today?
- He dumped all the Skittles out.
- He did?
- Yeah.
-  That's crazy.
He's a silly elf, huh.
- Yeah.
- So Fred was playing
in the Skittles, huh?
- Yeah.
- What's he doing now?
- He.
Let's go out here.
-  Oh, you wanna show me?
- Yeah.
-  Okay.
(Christmas music)
What happened?
- He disappeared!
-  He did?
What?
He was sitting up here, wasn't he?
- Yeah.
-  That's what I thought.
Do you think he went back
to the North Pole already?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so Fred has to
go back to the North Pole
every day to tell Santa what
you and Finn were up to, huh.
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, I don't see him anywhere.
♪ Bells, Jingle all the way ♪
- Let's play tag!
♪ Jingle bells ♪
(laughs)
We should decorate for Christmas more.
-  We should?
- Yeah!
Well, I actually have something
we haven't put out yet.
-  Really?
- Yeah, you wanna plug it
in and see what happens?
- Yeah.
-  Alright let's go.
Alright boys, come on!
We got something that we can set up
and I think that it would look great
right on this grassy little patch.
What do you think?
- Good.
- That's a good idea?
-  Yeah.
- Alright, Ollie, you hold the camera
and just point it at me.
-  Okay.
- We are now going to plug
in our Christmas decoration.
-  Yeah!
- Yay, you excited?
-  Yes.
- Okay and plugged in!
-  Go!
- Nothing's happening!
Hang on.
Wait, wait, keep filming!
Oh wait!
There it goes look!
Look!
-  Go, go, go closer!
-  Good job Ollie.
What's it gonna be?
What's it gonna be?
We don't know!
We won't know what it is
till it gets blown up.
We got Superman here helping us.
Superman's actually a pro.
- Oh my goodness!
-  What is it boys?
What do you think it is?
- Marshall!
-  It's Marshall!
Aw look at him.
- He's so cute!
-  What's he holding in his mouth?
- This.
-  A stocking!
-  It's a stocking.
That's so cool.
Well, hello Marshall.
How's it going?
You know what Marshall can do Ollie?
- What?
-  He puts out fires right?
What does he use to put out fire?
- Water.
-  Water, yeah.
So he'll protect us from fire!
Won't that be cool?
Whoa he has a backpack?
Is that where he stores all the water?
- Yeah.
-  That's cool.
- He puts it in here.
-  And then what does he do?
- He puts out the fire.
- Oh that's cool.
What do you think of that Finn?
He's like, "I just wanna pull his tail."
(chuckles)
This is so cute.
So we got a little PAW
Patrol Marshall blow up,
Christmas edition for the house.
- So cute.
I love it.
-  Should we get more?
We should try to get them all, huh?
- Yeah.
- Should we get Chase out here?
- Yeah.
I love his nod when he like
actually agrees with something.
He's like.
Those are his eyes, huh.
(laughs)
(Christmas music)
(knocking)
(door squeaks open)
-  Oh hi!
(laughs)
Got you.
Were you trying to scare me?
- Yeah.
- Not gonna happen, Mister.
The house has been
smelling so amazing all day
because we have had a pork
shoulder in the crock pot
with a little bit of Barbecue sauce.
Look at that you guys.
Pulled pork.
Pulled pork in the crock pot
is one of my most favorite things
because it's something
that's so easy to just, like,
grab and throw on a bun and eat.
I hate spending like
time on preparing food
or cooking food and stuff like that.
So, it's super easy.
Karma, you smell it too huh?
He's like, "Hey, ma give me some of that?
Ma gonna give me some
of that pulled pork?"
Pulled pork for dinner.
It's what's for dinner.
A fun idea.
Let me know on the comments below,
what are you guys eating
for dinner tonight
and I feel like that would give
a lot of people dinner suggestions
cause dinner is such a hard,
food is hard when you have a family.
Cooking for four people,
something that everyone likes
and loves and is healthy
and is convenient.
It's difficult.
I feel like if we had a
ton of dinner suggestions
down in the comments below
that it'd be super fun for us
and for a lot of you guys who
don't know what to eat for dinner.
Do you no know what to eat for dinner?
Cause you could just look down below.
Lotta people commented, hopefully.
(playful noises)
I tickled you.
The boys just got out of a bath
and we are getting them ready for bed.
What you got?
A little emoji?
Oh, were you chewing on that?
Luna is in desperate need,
oh hi Karma.
Apparently Karma needs some love.
Luna is in desperate need of some toys
so Christmas could not be
coming soon enough for her.
I think we're gonna spoil
these puppies on Christmas.
What do you guys want for Christmas?
Oh, we should totally
let them FaceTime Santa.
How cool would it be if
Karma FaceTimed Santa?
Oh my gosh Finn!
You're crazy.
Karma, you're such a good dog.
We got so lucky with these dogs.
Come on Finn, let's go!
Let's get your pajamas on!
- Day!
- Day!
That means okay.
You want this Luna?
You want this Luna, go get it.
This way Finn.
Matching pajamas tonight.
Yeah?
Ollie, who's on your pajamas?
- Yeti.
-  Yeti.
Remember that book we
used to read them babe?
The yeti book?
- Yeah, I still got it.
It's in Finn's room.
Hi.
Are you a puppy dog?
- They are so cute in
their matching pajamas.
They're matching during the day
and they even match at night.
(laughing)
Hey Ollie, who told you
you could jump on mommy and daddy's bed?
You silly kiddo.
(chuckles)
He always says papa.
(cheerful soft music)
Finn, what are you doing?
Hey!
Hey Ollie, did you have a fun day?
Don't lick me!
Ew!
You silly.
Did you have a fun day today Ollie?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Finn did you have a fun day?
He's literally tearing apart our bed.
You're not sleeping in
our bed tonight, dude.
- Yah.
- We had such a fun day with the boys.
I hope you guys enjoyed this video.
If you did be sure to
give it a big thumbs up
and we'll see you manana.
Ollie, you wanna say good night?
-  Yeah
- Kay, say bye.
-  Bye.
Boop.
(dance music)
