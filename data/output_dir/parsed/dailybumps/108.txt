(rooster crowing)
(cheerful pop music)
♫ We've gotta rise up
♫ Let the sun in
♫ We've gotta be strong
♫ And keep winning
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ We gotta rise up
♫ Let's live it
♫ 'Cause this is our tribe
♫ This is our tree
♫ We stand together
♫ We protect the keys
♫ This is our life
♫ This is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream
♫ This is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
♫ Can't get in our way
♫ We're moving
♫ And just like stars
♫ We're shooting
♫ Take this sword and we'll be fine
♫ Monsters won't dare cross that line
♫ This is our life
♫ Defend it
♫ 'Cause this is our tribe
♫ This is our tree
♫ We stand together
♫ We protect the keys
♫ This is our life
♫ This is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream
♫ This is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
♫ 'Cause this is our tribe
♫ This is our tree
♫ We stand together
♫ We protect the keys
- We can do it!
We are a family!
We are a tribe!
We got shields!
We've got each other!
Let's do this!
♫ This is our life
♫ This is our fun
♫ This who we are
♫ This is our dream
♫ This is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
♫ Live it forever
♫ Live it forever
