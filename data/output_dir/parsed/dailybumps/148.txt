- Good morning Ollie.
- Let me see that smile.
- Smile for mama.
He always has to get his picture taken.
Everyday mama takes your
picture before school?
Yeah?
(tranquil music)
Good morning!
Today's a big day for school huh?
- It's share day!
-  It is share day,
and what are you sharing today?
- A (mumbles) hook.
-  'Cause it starts
with an H, hook huh?
- Yes.
- Yeah.
Look at him carrying his lunch.
And we also got cupcakes,
'cause it's birthday party day.
- Birthday day.
- Birthday party day,
share day and picture day.
All in one.
That's awesome.
- And Finn does not
understand why he can't
have a cupcake.
- You want a cupcake dude?
(laughing)
You're gonna have a good day at school?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
(tranquil music)
Now we are headed into music class.
You get to do a little school too.
Okay?
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
He's like, he's still not totally sure
but I think he's gonna like it.
- Alright let's go make some music dude.
(cheerful music)
Finn you got an instrument?
It sounds so pretty.
Can you play a note Finn?
There you go.
Right?
Isn't that cool?
Say good morning June!
- Morning!
You having fun in music class Finn?
- You like her earrings?
- They're pretty huh?
- I like your orange
dress June, you look so cute.
Hey Finney, can you give it to June?
There you go, make sure June has a shaker.
Everyone's got their shakers.
(tranquil music)
What sticker did you get Finn?
You got a frog?
- Yeah!
- That's so cool.
Did you have fun at music class?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Alright we are now back from music class.
And this kid needs some milk huh?
- Yeah.
- Is there any milk
in your cup?
It's all gone.
Here, leave this here.
You go get the milk kay?
Come on.
He loves this you guys.
He can usually get the
door open by himself,
but he kind of struggles.
Grab the milk.
There you go.
It's a big one, be careful.
Good job!
Look at those strong muscles workin'.
(laughing)
I got it buddy.
This little dude is so serious
about his milk you guys.
He's gotta have his milk.
And he actually prefers white
milk over chocolate milk.
Unlike Ollie, which is really interesting.
It's crazy how different they are.
Hey did you have fun at music class?
- Yeah.
- That was so cool
playing with all the instruments huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
So that's like a once a week class
that we're taking Finn to now.
And he really loves all the instruments
and he's warming up a lot to all the kids
and the teacher and stuff.
(baby mumble)
Halloween?
Kay.
- Hawwaawee.
- Hey what do you wanna be fore Halloween?
- Baby.
- You want to be a baby?
(baby mumble)
Okay.
A Halloween baby, that's
what he's gonna be.
- We're home!
We have had a busy morning.
We had music class
and then I actually went to the gym,
came home and got changed.
I'm actually feeling a little
scraggly right now, still.
And Finn is changed into
some different clothes.
And actually I just got a call from,
actually I got a text
message from Ollie's teacher.
And he said he,
or she said that he had a little accident.
And I feel so bad.
He luckily has the good change of clothes.
I just feel really bad.
I don't know.
He never has potty accidents.
So I don't know if he was like embarrassed
to say he had to go potty.
Or if they were just super busy
and he like really forgot.
So, I hope that everything's okay.
I feel really bad though.
'Cause I'm sure that's kind of like
an embarrassing thing to happen.
I mean they're all
preschoolers so it's not like,
too dramatic, if it happens.
I'm sure it's happened
before in the class.
But I do feel really bad.
So I think I'm gonna pick him up.
Not early, I mean he's done with school.
Now he just does like
playtime and nap-time.
But maybe I'm gonna pick
him up during nap-time
and just bring him home.
'Cause I feel kind of bad for him.
Me and Finn are gonna go pick up brother.
- Yeah!
He's so excited.
You wanna get Ollie?
- Yeah.
- Yeah!
Poor little dude.
I actually tried to put him down for a nap
before I left so that he can
sleep while I picked up Ollie
and it just didn't happen.
And of course he passes out in the car.
I think he might actually stay asleep
and then go back to sleep
when we get in the car.
We'll see what happens.
Hey Bub, we gotta go get Ollie.
Do you wanna go get Ollie?
Hi Finney, are you okay?
Were you tired, sleep in?
Yeah.
Well let's go get Ollie then you
can go back to sleeping kay?
Aw Finn are you so happy
to see your brother?
He got to pick up his hook.
Everything.
And now they're just playing with toys.
Hey Bud, are you eating
your lunch in the car?
Did you forget to eat lunch?
Were you just too busy havin' fun?
Yeah?
Well how was school?
- Good.
-  Do you want to tell
us anything that happened?
- I went pee-pee.
- Oh no!
That's okay though huh?
Yeah.
What happened, did you forget?
Yeah.
Were you just too busy havin' so much fun?
Yeah it sounds like he was
just havin' a lot of fun.
He was playin' and just totally forgot.
So how was share day?
- Good.
- Good.
You shared your toy?
Did everyone like the hook?
Yeah and what was your favorite toy that
other people brought?
- A baby dog.
- A baby dog!
'Cause it starts with a what?
- Ba.
- Ba, ba.
- Ba.
- B!
- Ba, B!
- Yeah!
And so that was your favorite
thing that someone brought?
That's so neat!
And how was the birthday party?
- Good.
- Was that fun?
What did you get to eat?
- A cupcake.
- A cupcake?
- Yeah.
- Yeah,
what kind was it?
- I had sprinkles with vanilla.
- Oh yum.
That sounds good.
Alright Ollie last but not least,
but how did picture day go?
- Good.
- Good.
Did you smile?
Show me how you smiled.
Aw, that is a cute smile!
- And then I went like this. (grunting)
- Oh! (laughing)
So you did like a funny
smile and a cute smile?
Good job.
His teacher said that
anytime that they have like
anything that's like out of
the ordinary for their day
where it's like they're not
doing their usual routine,
and like for instance it was picture day
and a birthday party day she
said every kid is just crazy.
And it sounds like almost every teacher
had just a hard day today
'cause it was just totally off
their schedule and the kids were like,
what's going on?
Why are we going to take pictures?
It sounds like they got through it.
Everything was good.
And I think it's pretty
cute that he got to do his
very first picture day.
I can't wait to see the photos!
- Welcome back Ollie.
How was school?
- Good.
- Did you have
picture day?
- Yeah.
- They took your picture?
That's so cool.
We missed you, love you.
- I missed you too.
- Yes I have been working at home.
We just picked up Ollie from school
and oh my God, there is
a mouse on our counter.
(laughing)
Wait, did he just topple over?
Oh it's like a baby mouse!
Oh my gosh, Ollie, Finn do you see this?
Look at him move.
Is he asleep?
- Don't touch him guys.
Don't get too close.
-  Gross!
-  Is he okay?
-  Oh he's movin'!
Okay.
How long was that up there?
- Oh, it's so gross!
I have to clean this whole thing.
- Oh my gosh.
Look at him, now he's active huh?
Oh my gosh, that was crazy!
Our garage door has been
open for a couple hours
because we've been going in and out.
- So cute.
- You think it's cute yeah.
(laughing)
- It's so gross.
I mean it's cute.
- How did it get here?
-  It probably lives outside buddy
and it came in through the garage door.
- It's so gross.
But yet it is so cute.
- He is pretty cute.
Not everyday you wake up and see that huh?
I remember as a kid,
waking up and going into the
kitchen to make breakfast
and seeing oh my gosh,
and seeing like mice run across
the--
- Ew!
- It was the craziest thing.
And it was just something
we dealt with as a kid in our house.
There's mice in every house isn't there?
- No.
-  Are you sure?
- No, there's definitely
not mice in every house.
-  Okay, or is it spiders?
(screaming)
I think there's spiders
in every house right?
- Yeah there's spiders.
- They say something like,
you eat like a thousand spiders a year
when you sleep.
- No, that is not true.
That is absolutely ridiculous.
- And Missy doesn't believe it.
Aw.
Oh, oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God.
You got it?
Oh my gosh.
Okay I got it.
I got him!
Oh my gosh okay.
I'm basically a pro at
catching baby mice now.
What Ollie?
- So cute.
And all alone.
-  He is all alone.
Look at the baby mouse.
Can you believe that babe?
- No.
-  Baby mouse in our kitchen.
- Does it bite?
-  I don't think so.
- I mean I wouldn't touch it.
- He seems pretty friendly.
The boys are just looking at him
and we put a little bit of water in there.
-  Finn you're
just holding your hand
out to hold him?
- Yeah. (laughing)
-  The kids are so funny.
You wash your hands really good?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we gotta
wash your hands.
- Yeah I didn't
use the soap.
-  You didn't need soap?
You gotta use soap when
you wash your hands!
- I don't!
- I don't!
- My preschooler thinks
that he doesn't need
to wash his hands with soap.
You gotta wash your hands with soap buddy.
(laughing)
Okay, redo, try again.
Wash your hands with soap this time, okay?
(upbeat music)
It's funny too because
we actually have like
a pest service that comes to our house
once a month and sprays
inside and outside.
And I still see, spiders, all the time
inside of the house.
And now a mouse so.
We should probably step our game up a bit.
Hey Ollie, what's goin' on here?
- I'm pulling Finn's stinky feet.
-  You're pullin'
Finn's stinky feet
down the hallway?
- Yeah.
- And Finn is enjoying it a lot.
Careful of the chord,
careful of the chord.
Okay I think Finn's had enough.
Finn, I think it's your turn to pull Ollie
down the hallway okay?
Grab his feet Finn, pull him, pull him!
Pull him!
(laughing)
I don't think he's strong enough.
Oh he's trying so hard it's so cute.
Aw, you boys are so cute.
Oh and now he wants you to do it.
Finn!
He likes it.
Okay that's enough horse-rousin I think.
Give your brother a huge.
Hug it out brothers.
Hug it out brothers.
Horse-play and hugs, right?
They're seriously so cute.
I love them so much!
Can you stand on your head?
Here, I'll hold you up.
Look at you.
Look at you dude.
- I wanna show mama.
- Whoo, nice!
You did a little flip.
- Ow, ow.
-  Aw did you hurt your knee?
- Yeah.
- Aw.
Do I need to kiss is all better?
- Yeah.
- Sometimes all you need
is to kiss it all better.
How's that?
- Good.
- Okay.
You too?
You want me to kiss your knee?
There you go.
(laughing)
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.
(laughing)
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.
Alright boys.
(giggling)
You body slammed me Finn.
Oh geeze.
Okay now they're all
climbin' on top of me.
Okay.
(snoring)
Babe!
They're getting weapons, send help!
Okay.
To be fair, I did rean him Hop on Pop
when he was a kid.
That's probably where they learned it.
Thank you Dr. Seuss.
Thank you Dr. Seuss for
this magical moment.
Oh my gosh.
- Check it out.
I put fake hair in
today and I did it all by myself
which I've never done before.
I actually think it looks pretty good.
I think it could look a little better.
Like blended a little bit better
but I am not a professional
and this will just have to do.
But the reason I did this
is 'cause me and Bryan are
actually goin' out tonight
and we're gonna go to a concert
and just have a fun date night.
And we are super duper excited.
And so the boys are really excited
'cause they get to stay with?
- Mimi and papa!
- Mimi and papa!
They are super excited.
My mom and dad are here.
And yeah I think we're actually
just gonna end the vlog.
It's gonna be fun to just go and relax
and have fun and not worry
about any vlogging so.
Finn do you want to help me end the vlog?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.
Alright say, give this
video a big thumbs up!
Yeah!
Say we'll see you guys tomorrow!
Okay, ready and...
(baby mumble)
