good morning you guys look who I woke up
next to my buddy the poop emoji I think
it's my brother mowing
I also woke up and started watching
Jimmy Kimmel videos I don't know if you
guys know but Jimmy Kimmel has a YouTube
channel and he puts up the most
hilarious things I'm watching this one
called I gave my kids a terrible present
I love when parents torment their kids
with stuff like this I honestly just
cannot wait until Oliver's old enough
and I can like play tricks on him like
put a hot dog and wrap it up and put it
under the tree you know and just like
see his reaction and film it of course
obviously so if you guys want to check
out the video or any of the other
hilarious videos that Jimmy Kimmel has
on his YouTube channel I'll have a link
below in the description or you can also
click the little annotation on the video
just right on Jimmy Kimmel's beautiful
little face
this is our son baby boys do amazing
things today is always very first full
of cereal as you can tell it's
everywhere I think I even just found
some in my room yeah what do you think
your cereal miksa I gave him Rice
Krispies well you know if he's anything
like me he wants reason oh I see if he
that doesn't apply Kunis I'll probably
find him like a really good cereal was
he eating it though
yeah he's eating quite a bit seriously
it's all over me oh good job yeah do you
see that why did he do that
yeah he just picked it up put in enough
hmm
good job oh man I made a little mistake
so we're filming for Lucas vlogging
which means that whatever Oliver the
outfit is that he's wearing
it's basically what his outfit that he's
going to be wearing for the video well
we took a break so he could eat lunch
and he's built his food all over this
all over himself sits like on his pants
and his shirt oh but I think I clean it
up good enough that you won't be able to
tell you'll have to tell me if you can
tell in the video over here
go pay oh yeah we've been doing some
filming getting stuff done as usual pool
guys here to do that stuff do all the
pool we had to tell him that we heated
the pool again you're like it's okay hey
Oliver what are you doing making music
car was like uh you gotta stop it
he isn't rocking out right now to some
pans clanking together he's like ah yeah
Oh silly you're not even supposed to be
in that drawer you're telling me put
Carm out watch out careful he's not out
of the way yet okay there you go oh
goodness
Oliver hey let me see you however Hey
what are you doing so mean all I just
ran to Target to grab and groceries that
we needed and there was something I
wasn't sure about and I was trying to
call Brian at my phone just like died in
the middle of my shopping trip so that
was very convenient but I think I got
everything that we need he's basically
just thing and then he just plays with
everything and grabs everything and puts
everything in his mouth huh you're crazy
yes you are Gatorade gotta get that
can't forget the eatery Brian organize
my office a little bit I got rid of some
boxes push things to the side I honestly
just can't do anything yet because I
just I have nothing yet um I got my
ukulele here and I actually ordered a
nice little holder that will actually
hold it like on the wall which i think
is really cool cuz I can like display it
when I'm not playing it and stuff I
haven't played it as much recently um I
played it just a little bit just now but
my ps1 oh I bite my nails like crazy
like I am a really bad nail biter and so
I've stopped doing it for probably like
two weeks and look at my nails you guys
look how long they are you guys they're
way better now and basically long nails
are just easier to play with so I'm
thinking now that I have a little bit
better nails and so I can maybe strum a
little easier so I'm gonna trying to
vote like 15 minutes a day to this bad
boy just 15 minutes a day to learn
something new maybe like learn a new
chord or practice strumming anything
really cuz I really just I want to know
how to play it
and of course I'm going to be bringing
this bad boy to vlogger fair to Seattle
next month where I'm gonna meet Jared
for the first time Jared me come from
Jared and Ellie and he plays too so
he'll probably be able to help me out a
lot too so that I should be fun we will
even do like some songs together
but yeah biting my nails was definitely
like a bad habit to get over and it was
it's just a really bad habit it's gross
and it's like I would bite them so badly
you know so I'm actually really proud of
myself that I haven't done that in so
long you guys it's been so long but you
guys should let me know in the comments
what is a bad habit that you guys have
that you've always wanted to quit or
stop doing or you just don't like or
maybe you don't want to quit it you're
just like yeah it's just a habit I have
and I don't really care you know let us
know let's talk about it like no fears
and water okay Betty gonna jump yeah go
ollie
one yeah yeah oh
it comes out smile and the funny thing
ready 1 2 I'm right now blogging with a
camera that doesn't go underwater and
I'm in the water so we'll see how this
goes I have the wrist thing on so that's
good but anyways I mean not like swimmin
yes ha can you usually Elise likes to
hang out on this step and I let him
practice like going underwater and like
jumping to me because he likes doing
those things like he put himself that's
him doing that you're crazy huh but I
was saying like he's not afraid of the
water he's very comfortable in the water
and he knows like he has to hold his
breath or blow bubbles under the water
and so I think that's really cool like I
don't want him to see her water but at
the same time it's kind of scary when
you have a baby that's like very
comfortable he's like I can do this you
know but it's interesting I think they
in no time he will be safe in the water
he's definitely not there yet but I
think that we're going in the right
direction where he can
at least he understands water he just
can't figure out how to feel in his back
but he thinks he can just get in good
job
can we pick up I got some chicken cordon
bleu Zin the making you guys got two big
old chicken breasts carved some little
cavities in there stuffed it with some
ham and Swiss cheese and I'm going to
top it in the egg breadcrumbs I'm gonna
fry it up a little and then you
basically just like bake it so I'm
actually following Byron Talbott chicken
cordon bleu recipe it's on YouTube you
guys can just search it that way but
it's just a super simple little classic
recipe and then I think I'm gonna do
some sweet baby carrots on the side
Carla can you screw my guts hi mom
okay here you go can you throw that for
me look just give me a zombie on site so
far so good
gonna grill these up to a nice and
golden brown throw them in there and
then roll in the oven to cook the rest
of the way I just hope all that ham and
cheese stays in there so excited for
tonight's dinner you guys you have no
idea I was like watching Byron's video
salivating because I was just like oh

good job Brian
out I'm gonna do a little girly thing I
am actually getting ready to remove my
nails so I got these like quite a while
ago actually surprisingly enough they
lasted a very long time tonight I got
this nail polish remover dip it it's
like very very strong it's like maximum
strength it's to take off artificial
nails and I'm looking forward to taking
off because although I've gotten really
used to them and I'm very impressed with
these ones my actual nail is very long
right now and so I'm gonna put some nail
polish on them and see if I can get them
to actually stay that long I already
opened it and like touched it and it's
like the worst feeling like you touch it
in your finger you can feel it wet but
it feels dry it's cold and it's gross
and it's horrible and I'm not looking
forward to it
but I'm hoping hoping that I can get
these things removed so I can try and
use my actual real nail so I just got
them playing the Wii U with Jared we
played some online Mario Kart and of
course he was like I'm not that good and
