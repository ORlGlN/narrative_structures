big brother don't ya in case you're
wondering what all that racket is over
here that is Zuri playing with the craft
paper good mornings are you good morning
guys today I have a doctor's appointment
and I'm going to be having an ultrasound
done and hopefully we can find a couple
of answers about what's going on but
because I have an ultrasound I cannot
eat or drink in six hours and I woke up
too late this morning to eat something
in the morning so I have a feeling by
the time my appointment goes on I'm
gonna be quite hungry good morning guys
I am getting ready for my day I'm
actually doing my makeup and when I do
my makeup I usually get a chance to
either watch our vlog or watch another
vlog and so I chose to watch our vlog
this morning so I'm just like it's just
about over and it's funny because it was
mostly like me like the whole day
blogging yesterday cuz Brian was gone
and I'm so about the like saying or
actually doing my makeup and like
through the out the entire vlog there's
like this smudge on my eye and it's like
from this this like eyeliner that I just
got and I feel like I even thought
throughout the day and I just kept like
trying to rub it off and then probably
as soon as I rubbed it off it just was
like they're like right after that and
so the entire mole I literally have the
thing I'm like sitting and doing makeup
mine okay well gotta fix that that's the
hard thing about being a vlogger is like
some days you just don't look very good
but that is reality and even though
reality isn't that most people have to
like put it up to the Internet for and
tons and tons of people to see you just
got to be you and sometimes you get a
little smudges on your
you just got to build it so yeah I'm
trying to prevent that from happening
again I think I set it this time so that
it doesn't like wake up there
hopefully it worked very good doing my
makeup if you guys don't know that by
now but just for them that's my makeup
gotta do some mascara and a couple other
things and then I gotta do my hair all

think they're gonna do an ultrasound on
me and see if they see anything crazy I
did blood work and I did a breath test
now I'm doing ultrasound they still
can't see anything they have to do this
procedure where they actually stick a
camera down my throat and my producer
yesterday was telling me about it
because he's had sinus problems and he
had to they basically NUMMI with like a
spray and they stick a camera of your
nose and you can like feel it it doesn't
hurt but you can like feel it like move
another every yeah that freaked me out
too so hoping that we don't have to do
the camera thing and maybe they'll have
some results from my blood work so we
what is going on
all right so we're all out of my
appointment missing what did you think
of the inside of my body well one out of
ten I was really trying to look at like
like I was like what are you looking or
not she'd say like they deliver I think
yeah she was like googling pictures of
like wood because she was really hinting
towards that she thinks it's called
water lawsuit like in the gallbladder
and then I look at the gallbladder and I
definitely saw a little thingy let me be
frank that I didn't say I'm gonna take
definitely I'm what I was looking at
what I'm doing at Oh we're just hoping
to have an answer they had my blood work
there they said it was all normal
I'm uh really good I was even worried
about my cholesterol and they said I had
a really good cholesterol and my back my
bad cholesterol was good too yeah and I
the breathing tests came back normal
could they were checking for ulcers but
it
it's not a no sir so those it's all
butter at least you have an answer but
if it's not that then I just really
don't want to have surgery
yeah breaks me out it's laparoscopic and
easy peasy everyone gets people to make
it any better I have been fasting all
day excited to my ultrasound and so I'm
pretty much very hangry actually I have
a really bad headache
I'm not eating too so we're at Tom's
grabbing some food cause I need
oh you know Finn just hanging out
literally just hanging out hanging out
oh hey get out oh oh that was rough ma
how about some food think it's about
food time Finney time for dinner
it is dinner time tonight and I'm going
pretty easy pretty simple it's just been
like a super busy day so I'd have much
time to prepare anything so today he's
eating just like a little peeper jelly a
little bit of banana and then I also got
him this cool pouch of the store that
basically it was like in the freezer
area and it says it contains sweet
potato carrot broccoli and then I
actually looked at the ingredients it
literally says like organic sweet potato
organic carrots organic broccoli and
water and that's it and I think that's
so cool that I can like buy a pouch
that's in the freezer section so you
know it's like fresh and or at least you
know it's been frozen but it's not like
in the non refrigerated area where you
know they have to put something in it
and I don't know I'm pretty excited
about it I hope you like he did eat one
yesterday that was like just fruits and
he really liked it so I'm gonna give him
this one see what he thinks
I tried wait does veggies I'm really
enjoying this sandwich so yeah easy to
tonight me and Bryan had a late lunch
because he had the ultrasound so we
might end up eating dinner like way
after the kids go to bed or something
but it'll be nice I think the kids are
gonna wrote about early and we're gonna
relax and hang out and watch some big
brother I'm sorry are you supposed to be

never see that do you really see a
lizard wait

lizard know it's not that their doorbell
hey you thought it was a lizard oh you
