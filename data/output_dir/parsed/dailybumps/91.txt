- Hey, Finn, can you give Dada a hug?
Give me a hug, big hug,
big hugs, big hugs.
Oh, I got another big hug.
Big hug, ohhh!
I love you guys. (laughing)
(child laughing)
-  I think this
is what Ollie thinks
of all this Christmas shopping.
Are you exhausted?
But he's pretty worn out.
He's like, "Mom, tell
me when you're done."
Come on, we gotta go get Andy somethin'.

-  Morning!
- Hey boys, how's it goin'?
- Good.
- Good?
It wouldn't be a Saturday
morning at our house
without watching funny pet
videos on YouTube, right?
- Um-hum.
- These kids love watching anything
that has to do with cats or dogs.
And, I actually have a lot
of cute horse ones, too.
Oh, look at the kitty.
-  Oh.
- He's trying to get
the french fry. (laughs)
This is like the new
Saturday morning cartoons.
It's Saturday morning cat videos.
- Look, a birdie!
- Oh, it is a birdie!
It is a beautiful Saturday mornin'.
Missy is frying up some eggs for us.
These are our eggs, right?
-  Yep.
-  Are we getting enough eggs?
How's our egg production?
- It's going okay.
-  We have like, four, three?
- I feel, I wish it was a little better.
-  Yeah.
- We're getting like two or three a day.
- Well, also, we just hatched,
like, a ton of chickens
and we only ended up
with one layer, right?
- Two.
- Two, okay.
So, we need...
It's probably time for more babies soon.
- Yeah.
- We'll probably have to do
that again in the Spring.
- In the Spring--
- Yeah, that'll be cute.
Then we can have lots more eggs.
-  Yeah.
- Mmm, but I am so hungry.
Hey, kiddo.
Hey, Finn, can you give Dada a hug?
Give me a hug, big hug,
big hugs, big hugs.
Oh, I got another big hug.
Big hugs, ohh!
(child laughing)
I love you guys. (laughing)
We woke up this morning and Fred
was perched right on our closet door.
Check him out looking at everyone.
(Finn babbling)
(laughing) Are you saying hi to Fred?
(pleasurable music)
Our fish are doing so good, you guys.
They're like all friends and
they're all so friendly now.
They get a little spooked
when you get close,
but like, even Tina's coming out.
You see the fishies?
- Yeah.
- They're doing good, huh?
What's not doing good are starfish.
We have gone through
three different starfish
and they never last, and
I'm not quite sure why.
But all the other fish that we've added,
all the coral that we've added
has been doing really good.
So, we're feeding them worms
and shrimp, which is this.
And we also feed them seaweed.
- Yeah.
-  And then also pellets, right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Alright, Ollie, are you
gonna help me feed the fish?
- Yeah.
-  Alright, climb up on the chair.
There we go, put the chair
right next to the tank.
I got all the food that you need
to drop in there right there.
Sort of sprinkle it on top
and those fishies can start eatin'.
There we go.
Good job.
I don't think they got the
memo, though. (laughing)
Oh, there they go.
There they go.
- Ooh, one just go on trip!
- Yeah! (laughing)
Check out this new bubble coral
we have in here, you guys.
It's so cool looking.
So we gave them pellets and
now I'm going to squeeze in
the worms and shrimp,
just a couple of times in
the tank, just like so.
- Wait, do we have shrimp?
-  Yeah, there's little
pieces of shrimp in there.
See, OJ's going for it.
There's Tina. (laughing)
Oh, there's Ty and Lloyd and Pearl.
- Hi!
- Yeah.
He really likes the worms.
-  Yeah.
- I love seeing him scramble up
on the sand like that.
It's so cute. (laughing)
And Pearl is getting really big, too.
(pleasurable music)
So, yeah, that's a little
update on our fish.
They're doing really well,
and it's been really fun
to have fish that have, like,
a little more personality
and that the kids enjoy and they
can be involved in a little bit more too.
Oh, I just saw him jump to,
like, the top of the water.
That was crazy.
- Mmm, yummy.
- Yeah, peanut butter
jelly time. (laughing)
Ollie said, "It's lunch time for the fish,
"so it's also lunch time for me."
So I said, "Sure," and I
said, "What do you want?"
He wanted me to make him a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Doesn't that look delicious?
- Yeah!
-  Yeah, look
at that yummy sandwich.
(upbeat music)
- Alright, where are we going today,
or where are we going right now, Ollie?
- Christmas shopping!
- Yeah, and where are we headed first?
- Toys"R"Us!
-  Toys"R"Us!
Can you see it?
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
- Look!
- Ollie's so excited 'cause me and him
are going Christmas
shopping, and he says he's
never been Christmas shopping before.
Sure, we've taken him a few
times, but we have a plan today.
We're going to Toys"R"Us,
we're going to get a bunch
of our family kid presents done,
and so he's excited to pick them all out.
Who are you buying presents for today?
- CJ and Billy and Peng-yu.
-  Okay, and Liv,
yeah, and Olivia and Emma.
It's gonna be a fun day, huh?
Hey, Ollie, it says, "Nice
kids enter here," alright?
So, you have to be nice to go through.
Alright, we are almost done
with all our Christmas shopping,
but we've definitely had
a harder time figuring out
what we should get for Peyton, huh?
- Yeah.
- And, it's hard because
she's at that age where, like,
anything is cool, but I'm
like, should I get her
something girlie, should
I get her something like,
just fun, or like a game.
So, what do you think she should get?
- A mini like, a doll.
- A doll?
A doll is always a good option.
So, we're just trying to figure out just
the last few things to get,
but we're having a blast.
And he's having a great time just looking
at all the toys that he wants, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Did you figure out
what you want to get for Finn?
- This.
- You want to get him that.
He's like, "This looks
like a great thing."
Honestly, shopping for kids
is like the easiest thing,
especially at a store like this.
Toys"R"Us is pretty fun, huh?
I think this is what Ollie thinks
of all this Christmas shopping.
Are you exhausted? (laughs)
We're now in the mall at Macy's
and we've been getting a ton done.
I'm actually feeling pretty good.
I think we'll be done Christmas
shopping by today, I hope.
But he's pretty worn out.
He's like, "Mom, tell
me when you're done."
Come on, we gotta go get
Andy somethin'! (laughing)
You've been a really good
shopping partner, 'kay.
Ahh, did you guys miss each other?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Oh, you gotta tell him that
we bought all kinds of fun gifts!
What?
(Finn babbling)
Oh, yeah?
- Wait--
- He's so cute.
Alright, go play, boys!
- So, I wanted to show you
guys something real quick,
that might be giving you a
little bit of a sneak peak
of how we're designing Ollie
and Finn's new shared room.
This is one of the pieces
that has come in the mail,
and I did something really
special with it, so, it's a,
it's basically like a
big, hanging lantern.
It plugs in and it has a switch,
and it's like really cool and it's metal,
and it's nice.
But what I did was I put a certain type
of bulb in it so it looks like a fire.
Look at that, it's so cool.
It's like an LED fire bulb,
makes it looks like there's like
actually fire in this lantern.
And I'm so excited with how
it looks and it turns out.
And I had to, like, get a
couple different sizes because
it like didn't fit in there at first.
But now it does, but yeah.
Check out this lantern.
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
And yes, it kind of does
give a little bit away
about how we're designing
the room, but I think
you guys are still gonna
be really surprised.
I love technology.
This is so cool.
-  Boys, why is
your bedroom such a mess?
- 'Cause.
-  Did you guys
have fun in your room?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
They have been playing
so much that now the room
that I just had perfectly cleaned,
because I just cleaned out
tons of stuff the other day
is now a mess.
Huh? (laughing)
We are getting ready for bedtime.
They're in their Christmas jammies.
(Finn babbling)
Yep. (laughing)
We're reading our stories.
We've been reading
Captain Underpants again.
We started reading that a few months ago,
and we finished like three books.
- Look, you guys!
This is my favorite one!
- That is a really good one.
It's about aliens and
it's pretty exciting, huh?
And they actually sometimes
just fall asleep during it,
which I think is super cute.
Yep, that's an alien.
But, yeah, we're just
having a really fun time.
We were supposed to roll
peanut butter balls today
and make cookies,
but Mama just got so busy
with all her shoppin'.
I got tons done, though.
I'm, I'd say like 95% done,
so that's really nice.
Although Christmas is a week away,
so it's not like I'm
that prepared. (laughing)
I still have stuff to do.
Alright, are you guys--
- Yes.
- Ready for bed?
- Yeah.
- We just opened our Advent calendars
and we had a lot of fun.
There's nine days 'til Christmas.
Tomorrow's eight days 'til Christmas.
Anyways, I think we're gonna
go ahead and end the video,
so make sure you give this
video a big thumbs up.
Thumbs up Ollie, thumbs up Finn.
No, don't leave Finley.
Oh my goodness.
And we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Do you want to do the bye-boop
since your brother's being naughty?
You're gonna miss out on bye-boop!
(Finn exclaiming)
Ready?
One, two, three!
- Bye, boop!
-  Finley?
What do you want?
(Finn babbling)
You want to do the boop?
You've gotta come back here and sit down.
- No.
-  Okay then, no bye-boop.
(laughs)
Bye boop.
(upbeat music)
