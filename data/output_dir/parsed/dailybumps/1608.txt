my workout this morning so had to get up
a little bit earlier and I am jamming to
some tunes on my new laptop
I really am really loving the laptop I
totally forgot how amazing it is to be
portable well so I weighed myself this
morning and I was 211 point five so
that's three pounds for my first week
it's a little bit slower start than I
wanted but I think that's just the
motivation I need to keep going and you
keep eating well and to keep exercising
and keep at it still going for that goal
I will be under 200 by the end of the
month okay I will I will
you guys leave me motivation in the
comments please I needed so this morning
I am actually making black bean brownies
if you guys don't know I have made these
on the vlog before they're really really
good you don't taste the beans and
they're a lot healthier he's got lots of
protein in them so they're really good
for before after your workout and I did
get that sugar free time because it was
like a lot less calories too so I'll
show you how I do this alright so I did
one can of black beans and I drink
Cawood he done he's like breakdancing
behind me I got one can of black beans i
drained the nasty stuff that's in it and
I filled up the rest of the can with
water and then I just chop this up in

just kidding I'm going under a bridge me
and my mom are going to attempt to go
out in this crazy weather it's actually
really rainy today which is nice it's
very rare California to have a rainy day
I'm even wearing boots that good I love
my boots um so I also gotta find
something a little bit warmer for
all-over wear something cute to season
get to wear his warm clothes very often
so it is a little bit chilly on my chest
more melted maybe even a jacket
we went with this sleeper outfit because
it's got this cute little monster hat
and yeah super cute and warm and toasty
and y'all havin it I did not like him
with hat on I just love seeing his hair
and stuff but it's warmer that way huh
probably not even that cold outside
probably like super exaggerating but I
just wanted and I just wanted to put
something warm on my gosh you guys it's
like an actual rainy day in California
nope we always need milk it's like
ridiculous
but I'm not taking Oliver I just wanted
to jump on the car and grab this because
it's so rainy and cold out they say rain
is like the most amazing thing in
California at least where I live
definitely it's raining I just want to
jump in this puddle so badly
ah raining I'm like obsessed with it
it's really just cool and the funny
thing is that our town we since we don't
get a lot of reading our streets aren't
really designed to like handle rain so
if it rains a lot we get flooded a lot
like you have to just wing it to like
drive in like a foot of rain so it's
really
it's raining you guys Cassey is outside
playing in the rain
karma needs a rain buddy yeah that's so
funny she's soaking wet remember the
good old days babe when we were kids and
we just play in the rain and not care
about getting wet you do look at my wife
you guys look on Angie you're looking I
all fall you got the brown that Leigh
that's like the epitome of fall right
there you guys those socks right there
that is how false started you put on
those socks and then fall started to
come we have a fireplace do you think

car seat all day

not gonna wake him up comment you have
fun outside you are soaked dude I'm
sorry to say but he's gonna need a bath
oh oh here's go down karma is apparently
swimming in the sea of carpet what are
you doing you trying off on the carpet
you think that's a good idea you're
headed to
the movies a star yeah it's like really
raining out and I don't know when you're
a Californian and it's raining driving
steps and everyone drives super slow
because everyone's really scared of the
raining because we never dive I mean I
don't dry like a Californian yeah he
does but yeah we did end up leaving
Oliver up we were going to take him but
Sean had said that it's like really loud
like one of those really intense movies
so in the end I was like maybe I
shouldn't and my mom kind of wanted to
hang out with him anyways so I went
ahead okay this is really scary oh my
god
slow down oh my god anyways yeah my mom
went to hang out with Oliver so I was
like all right
and I really thought I got these new man
bombs I may as well put them to use
so I pumped a little milk and he's got
freshly squeezed milk okay that's so
excited to see gravity I'm putting some
popcorn
oh my gosh it's making the pumpkin patch
that's so kind of I look like this is a
huge ship with a big ol octopus ah well
that I usually means it's like gonna be
how
him uh yeah babe it's this month look
I'm even wearing a jacket now you guys

see it yeah look it says my iphone says
it's raining like it literally has
raindrops falling out so funny hey so we
just got in the movie and it was really
good did you like it it was so good I
literally like our friend set like I got
candy I was thinking about eating them

really intense it was cool I thought it
was really interesting it like I think
when you see the previous you're like
okay that sounds really boring it's just
not her floating in space but my god in
the end they like it's one of those
movies where they show like the title
and then you're like it all makes sense

bitch away
