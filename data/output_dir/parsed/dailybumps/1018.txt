and look at this I got a bendy straw I
had to catch it good morning guys
morning okay
all you're supposed to be taking a nap
right now and he is just sitting in this
crib not sleeping a little stink and I
keep telling him all you go night-night
and like that I said it that Mama that
this is about money I think he's trying
to explain to me why he doesn't think he
needs to take a nap but we all disagree
I wanted to show you guys my belly I
feel like it's super popped this week so
Brian let's show them my belly there's a
lot bigger to you I'm definitely
hagel shelf right here yah yeah it kind
of does crazy how like fast it happens
getting bigger there's a baby in there
just gonna keep getting bigger so jarrod
and Michelle left super early this
morning and we had such a great time
hanging out with them this weekend we
got so much done and if you guys don't
know we actually spent a weekend
songwriting and doing a little bit of
producing and this really doesn't mean
anything officially yet but I am working
on bigger things that I've been wanting
to do for a while it's been fun
releasing like little singles every now
and then but I kind of want to put
something although that's even bigger
more polished you know means even more
to me so that's kind of like the goal
for what we're working on now and I'm
not sure how long something like this is
really going to take I really just want
to take all the time that I need to make
it perfect because I think when you put
something out there as an artist you
want it it has your name on it you know
like you want it to be perfect
this is gonna be something really fun
that I get to work on until it's ready
you know what I mean but it just feel so
good to be collaborating with other
people and writing songs and and doing
big stuff you know it's it's gonna be
fun I told you guys
this is gonna be our biggest year yet oh
man I cannot believe the things we've
already done and we're not even halfway
through the year so the rest of this
year there's just so much cool stuff to
look forward to what you got beautiful
beautiful what about your in about look
it's so gross Carm
good so this isn't happening
this whole sleep thing Ollie you're not
gonna take a nap
oh mama went somewhere do you know where
mama went cuz she wouldn't tell me she
actually didn't tell you either
hey guys so me and my mom are actually
out now we are doing a little bit
shopping and I had to get a few errands
done that I can't really talk about
right now but um yeah so I'm just
getting some stuff done hang out mom

with Apple still let she bag was full

likes holding the entire Apple and
eating it oh good bye

we had to run out of the house to do a
couple more things brains actually in
the bank and all he didn't take a very
good nap earlier and he did not last
long in the car he pretty much lasted
like five minutes and he is out so I'm
not sure how long he's gonna be able to
sleep for though because after he leaves
