-  Oh no here we go!
Whoa!
That was a wipe-out if I
ever did see one (laughs).
- Basically there was a
morning, not to long ago,
where I woke up to the sound
of my chickens screaming.
-  Ollie, you're doing
so go with your up angles.
You know how to get the best shot.
You gotta lift up like that.
♫ This is our life, this is our fun,
♫ This is who we are.
♫ This is our dream, this is our team.
♫ Shot among the stars.
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine.
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine.
♫ This is our life.
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever!

Good morning Ollie and Finn.
- Hey guys, check us all out
in our Christmas onesies.
- Yeah, we all have onesies on today.
- Mainly just because
they're so comfortable.
-  So comfy.
- So comfy, I wish ours
had booties like these.
- I don't know, I like my feet out,
I don't like to feel trapped.
- We've been having such a good morning

I-card and in the description.
Excuse my crazy bed head by the way,

But, yeah music video went up today.
You like the music video?
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah, can you sing
a little bit of the song?
-  This is our
pride, this is our pride...

The boys love the song
still, they dance to it
all the time.
If you guys don't know,

Tribe, we did a lyric video for it, we did
a music video for it.
All that is gonna be in
the I-card, so go check
that out.
We have a fun day today
though, it's Saturday.
What do you boys wanna do?
- I want to go to a bouncy house.
-  He really wants
to go to a park and play.
-  I wanna lay in bed all day.
-  Yeah, we wanna
lay in bed all day,
(Missy laughs)
and play Nintendo.
-  Yes!
(Bryan laughs)
-  Oh no, here we go, oh!
Whoa!
That was a wipe-out if I ever did see one.
(Bryan laughing)
I love how Finn just
stays on the ground like,
"Yup, I'm down."
Get him, get him Finn, get him!
Oh geez! (laughs)
Are you okay mister?
(laughs)
They're having so much fun
right now pillow fighting.
Or Ollie might be having
fun, he's the one winning.
Oh, alright Ollie.
Hey, you gotta let Finn hit
you a couple times, kay?
Kay, Finn get him!
Finn can you get your brother?
Payback, he's coming in for revenge!
He's coming in for revenge, he (laughs)
just basically hit himself
with a pillow (laughs).
You're so silly.
(Finn giggles).
Get him Ollie, get him!
Ahhhh! (laughs)
Sorry Finn, I love you, you lost.
Alright get him, now's your chance,
pick up your pillow Finn.
Hit him with it, hit him with it!
Hit him with it!
Oh, I think the pillows
are too heavy for Finn.
That's my wife, still playing video games.
You really into this right now?
Oh, are you about to die?
Can you stop the game?
(Missy whines)
Awe.
- I hate this game!
Just kidding, I love it, I'm obsessed.
-  Look at these good
dogs, they just wanna play.
Beautiful weather.
Alright, go fetch! (laughs)
Just playing fetch with a
simple stick, they love it.
Hey, be nice Karma.
Oh, look he gives it to her.
Luna is such a stick hog,
and Karma will let her have anything.
(dog barking)
What?
Oh, you know there's toys in here?
Is there toys in there?
Look, what do you see?
Alright, what's in here?
What's in here, what do you want?
What do you want?
Just a bunch of junk in here honestly.
Any toys, any toys Finn for the puppies?
-  No.
-  No?
(bright upbeat music)
- It is so funny, he
does not want her playing
with his stick.
It's just a stick, it's okay.
-  Yeah?
- Yeah, she's 'gon play with it.
You ready Finn?
- Yeah!
-  Okay, it's
swinging time (laughs)!
(Finn laughs)
Awe, the hose is in the way.
Weee!
What do you think about
that Finn, is that fun?
-  Yeah.
(Bryan laughs)
- So I have finally got ready for the day.
I did my hair and I did my
makeup, and I was looking
for one little item and I
couldn't find it anywhere.
And then I found this little boy.
And this little boy.
(Missy laughs)
And I asked them, where is my eyeliner?
It's on your face, it's on your face!
It's literally dried to their faces.
- We need to wash it off.
-  Yeah, we need to wash it off.
And how did this happen Oliver?
- Finn just put the marker on my face.
-  He put it all over you?
And then he put it all over himself?
-  Mmhmm
-  Wow, and you
just let him do that?
- No.
-  No, you didn't let him do it,
but I see it all over your face,
so how did he do it?
- Here's more on my finger
-  Oh my goodness, you
got it on your finger too.
And let me tell 'ya,
that stuff is hard core.
It does not come off (laughs)
with just water.
I'm gonna need to break
out the makeup wipes.
Kay?
Let's do you first.
If you're wondering what marker it is,
it's the Two Faced Sketch Marker and
it is honestly awesome,
as you can tell (laughs).
Okay, here we go.
(light techno music)
-  And under my hair.
(Missy laughs)
-  You gotta hold the camera
so we can see it come off.
Here, let Daddy do it.
Alright.
-  Finn was drawing on you?
-  Yeah.
-  And your finger.
Anywhere else he got 'ya?
-  Yeah.
-  I think that's it, looks good,
now we gotta do Finn.
-  Hey Finn, you got something on
your face there dude.
-  Yeah.
-  Do You like
your makeup?
- Yeah
-  Is it just how you wanted it.
Oh, no? (laughs)
Alright, get it off.
I've never put eyeliner on my lips.
-  Or face or cheeks.
(Missy laughs)
Or forehead.
-  Anywhere.
-  Nice job, Finn.
- Ow! Ow!
-  Yeah, you put a lot on there,
so it's gonna take me a minute.
-  Now, it looks like
he has a five oh'clock shadow.
-  I know, it's
like a little, black.
- Ow, Ow!
-  There you go boys.
-  I think you're all clean.
-  Good as new,
let's not play in Mommy's
makeup, kay?
-  Look's good.
-  Been playing some Mario,
Super Mario Odyssey, the new Mario game
on the Switch, is amazing.
I've been playing in my office.
But, the boys were in the middle of lunch
and I think they are done which means
I have to pay up.
Let's see what Missy is doing in here.
Same thing (laughs)
- I'm so much further along though now.
-  I know, Missy is
a lot farther than I am.
So, I try not to look 'cause
I don't want spoilers either.
Alright boys, you finished your lunch?
-  Yeah.
-  Alright, you
cleaning you face off?
Yeah, Okay.
I promised the boys that
if they ate their lunch,
they could have a piece
of Halloween candy.
Yes, we still have Halloween candy.
Please, let me know in the comments below,
do you still have Halloween
candy in your house?
'Cause sometimes it gets
thrown out November first.
But we still have some.
Alright boys, so you get
to each pick one piece
of candy, okay?
-  Yeah!
Alright, wait, wait.
You have to say "Trick or Treat!"
-  Trick or Treat!
-  Alright, go ahead.
-  I want Skittles.
-  You always want the Skittles,
and you want Reeses?
-  Yeah!
-  That's 'cause
you're a lot like Momma
who loves Reeses and
you're a lot like Daddy
who loves Skittles.
Yeah but really, I don't know how long
the Halloween candy is
gonna be in our house.
So, we're just tryna treasure it
while we can, haha.
What, oh you want me to open it for 'ya.
- I opened mine all by myself.
-  Yeah you did.
Wow, you should be opening your brother's.
He's like, "Hey, give me one of those."
- Here Momma,
too slow!
- I wasn't even too slow,
you took it out of my hand.
-  Finn thinks its funny.
-  You think that's funny?
-  Try again, okay Ollie,
really give her one.
- Too slow (laughs)!
- I mean that time I was kinda slow.
(Bryan laughs)
Luna, what are you doing?
Missy let her chicks out to play
and Luna is being very
good at not attacking them.
Luna has had an interesting past with some
of these chickens.
She's gotten a little too
friendly and playful with them.
And we actually lost a couple.
- Basically, there was a
morning, not too long ago,
where I woke up to the sound
of my chickens screaming.
And I came out, they were
all fine except for one.
One did not make it.
-  Yeah.
- And I watched the camera, it's my fault,
I accidentally had left the coop open,
which I seriously messed
up with that 'cause
it wouldn't have been Luna.
It could've been a coyote.
-  Yeah.
- But yeah, she just was
playing with them honestly
and she just went a
little too far with one.
And it was really, really,
really sad and hard.
But, since then we've done a lot of work.
-  Yeah, look at this.
- I still wouldn't trust
her if I wasn't here.
-  Like leaving them alone, yeah.
Yeah, she's been pretty good around them.
- So, the truth is, is that we hatched six
chickens in May and four,
actually, were roosters.
'Cause I have three now and one died.
Now I only have two hens
that hatch from that
whole batch, that's crazy.
-  Sheesh!
- Both of these white ones
are roosters it turns out.
And that big one is a rooster.
-  Oh really?
-  Yup.
But Luna is being so good.
-  I know.
Come here Luna.
-  "I don't know if
I'm supposed to be down here."
-  It's okay.
-  You're doing a good job.
-  Hey chicks.
(light guitar music)
- A dinosaur just pooped
out a baby dinosaur.
-  A dinosaur
pooped out a baby dinosaur?
That is the funniest
thing you've ever said.
You're so funny dude, here you go.
Go, go, go!
Whoa, Finn, you have to slow down, dude.
This kid's got way too much energy getting
ready for bed tonight (laughs).
Woo!
(light guitar music)
-  Alright, what are we doing?
- We are doing helicopter.
-  We're doing a helicopter?
-  Yeah.
- When was I strong enough to
do a helicopter?
- Daddy's going to.
-  Oh, is Daddy coming?
- Yeah.
-  Ollie you're doing
so good with your up angles.
- Yeah.
-  You know how
to get the best shot,
you gotta lift up like that.
He just grabbed the camera and was like,
"I'm gonna vlog."
Do you wanna vlog anything else?
- Professor Poopy Pants.
-  Professor Poopy Pants.
- That's from Captain Underpants.
-  Well, you better get Daddy if
you wanna do helicopter.
Do you wanna go get him.
- I can't, I'm afraid.
-  Well, maybe
this one will go with you.
You want Finn to come with you?
-  Yeah.
-  Alright.
- Finn, Ollie, go get Daddy.
Go with Ollie so he's not scared Finn.
No, you're scary.
-  Climb into bed buddy.
-  I'm trying to get some books.
-  Ollie did you pick the books
you want me to read yo you?
-  Yeah.
-  Awesome, and
Karma already jumped up
and is ready for bed.
- I have this one, this one, and this one,
and on the bottom I
have this one, this one,
and this one.
-  Which one is your favorite?
- This one with the puppies on the back.
-  Oh, that's cool.
- See those baby puppies?
-  Oh yeah, they're on his back?
- Yeah
-  That's cool.
- And look at that baby kitty cat.
-  Ooo, that's so cute.
Okay, these are the books
we're gonna read tonight?
- Yeah
-  Better get started
then.
- And I got Buzz, and Woody,
and two-faced, and the gun.
- He calls it two-faced, he's two-faced.
You're so cute.
Ollie did you have a good day today?
- Yeah.
- And Karma, Karma's
licking me and Luna's like,
"Hey, what's up, I want in."
Come on up Luna, come on up.
