- I'm hoping that this goes a
little better than last time.
He really wants to show
you guys how brave he is.
So I'm gonna let him tell
'em what we're doing.
- I can cry if I want.
-  Yes, of course
you can cry if you want.
-  Hey boys, I know I've been gone
for a couple of days, but I
brought something back for you.
- What?
- You wanna see?
-  Ollie, where are we now?
- A new motorcycle.
- Should we get you a motorcycle, Ollie?
- Maybe.
- What did you do?
- I got a new ...
- A new what?
♫ This is our life
♫ This is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream
♫ This is our team
♫ Shine among the stars
♫ Take this shield and we'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
- Good morning!
- Morning!
- Good morning boys, I got up super early.
Actually stayed the
night in LA with Bryan,
but I came home really early,
so I could be with my boys.
(baby babbling)
You hang out with Papa and Mimi?
- Yeah.
- Was that fun?
- Yeah.
- Finn's already working on another knot.
I need to get Finn a haircut like ASAP.
Because he just keeps making
knots, and it's so sad.
The fishies are doing good today.
There's Lloyd and Pearl
and there's our big one.
We still haven't named him actually.
You guys should let us
know in the comments
what you think we should name him.
He's a pretty big guy.
Bryan likes to call him Dude.
He's just a big dude, I don't know.
But I've got some food for him.
Should we feed him?
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.
We've got a little strip of seaweed here.
And it's clipped onto this little clamp,
and then we're just gonna put
it right in here like that.
And then we wait.
(Oliver murmuring)
Lloyd's coming to say hi to you, huh?
- He's singing that's shining!
- He's singing Shining? (laughs)
We are at our first stop of the day.
Chickens need some food.
I've got Ollie with me.
- See the kitty cats!
- Yes, he really loves
those baby kitty cats.
I've got Papa with me,
and we're gonna go get
some chicken food and
some other extra things.
We just have like a few errands to do,
and Papa thought he'd tag
along, hang out with Ollie.
(gasps) Chickens!
-  So cute!
-  Oh my goodness!
They have the little chicks
that Susan or Hayhay is.
That one, so cute.
All kinds of babies.
What'd you find over here?
- Balls.
I can get one for Luna.
-  Okay, you wanna get a ball
for Luna and a ball for Karma?
- This one's for Luna.
The red one's for Karma.
-  Should we
get a big one for Luna?
Because she's kind of a bigger dog.
That might choke her.
-  Okay.
-  Yeah, there we go.
-  I think I'm
gonna give her a red one.
-  You gonna get two red ones?
- Mm-hm.
-  All right, let's do it.
All right, got our chicken food.
Then we got some fun stuff for the dogs.
I got these yummy cookies for the dogs.
I thought that that would be fun.
It's almost Luna's birthday.
Ollie! Who is that?
- Santa Claus!
-  Santa Claus, how cool.
Now he's checking out
these Halloween things.
Ollie, does this stuff scare you at all?
- No.
- No?
What are you playing with?
He's eating your arm!
So we just ran into PetSmart
and got dog food for Karma and Luna.
And they had so many cool things
for dogs who it's their birthday.
So I got the cutest stuff for Luna.
Her birthday isn't til next week,
but I'm still really excited.
She's gonna have like a cute little outfit
and little toys and treats
and we even can decorate our own treats.
They have like so much that
you can get at PetSmart.
It was crazy.
Way more than like the feet store.
But anyways, off to the next place, right?
Ollie, where are we now?
- A new motorcycle.
-  Motorcycle.
Are we gonna get a motorcycle?
- No.
- No. (laughs)
Should we get you a motorcycle, Ollie?
- Maybe a little one.
- A little one just for you?
Let's find some that fit you.
Ollie's like in heaven right now.
Hey wait, Ollie come sit
on this one right here.
Oh my goodness!
-  This is to go faster.
Vroom, vroom, vroom!
-  You are basically
big enough to ride that.
Oh my gosh!
(Papa mumbling)
Yeah!
-  Look at this one.
It looks smaller.
-  Look at this one, Ollie!
-  You gonna put training wheels?
- Oh my gosh, I know, right?
Wow, is that so cool?
So we are at this motor sports store
because we are looking at
getting another Polaris.
Our Polaris right now is just kind
of like not running super well,
so we kinda know it's out the door.
And we use it a lot to do a
lot of stuff around the yard.
And we've been kind of
looking at something
that has a little more power
and maybe won't break down on us.
Let me show you what we're looking at.
So we really want one that is two rows,
so all the family can sit in it.
But we don't want these
bucket seat type things
because we want a lot of
people to be able to fit in it
because the bucket seats, I mean really,
only two people can sit in there.
But when you have like bench seating,
multiple people can sit in that row.
So for instance, this one is a bench.
I mean we can put the kids in between us,
and me and Bryan can sit there.
Then there's a whole 'nother row
if like my mom and dad wanted to hop on.
Bryan originally picked out this one.
He's like, "I wanna get this one.
"I think it's a good
price and a good deal."
But we found this one which is
more power, way nicer, and cheaper.
And he's really working a deal for us.
So I'm super excited that
we were able to find it.
But I'm also nervous because I don't
normally do this stuff without him.
And I'm like, "Bryan, call me."
But he's driving and he's just
super busy and can't call me.
I think that he's gonna be
really excited about this choice.
I really like the color.
I like that it's got a lot
more power than that one.
I like just the look of
it is super, super nice.
And the seats are nice.
Like really, really comfy, nice seats.
And it's a great price.
So I'm super excited.
I think this is the one,
and I think I'm actually
just gonna go ahead and purchase it.
Because we really need to
get one, and my dad's here.
He gives me the thumbs up.
I feel pretty good about it then.
All right guys, we have
been doing errands all day.
We ended up getting the
Polaris that we wanted,
so I'm really excited about that.
But now we are doing the thing
that Ollie has been not
looking forward to all day.
He really wants to show
you guys how brave he is.
So I'm gonna let him tell
'em what we're doing.
- I can cry if I want.
-  Yes, of course
you can cry if you want.
What are you thinkin'?
Where we going?
- The doctor's place.
- Yeah, we're going to the doctor's?
- I'm supposed to ...
The shots hurt.
- Yeah I know, you gotta
get one shot today, okay?
Just one. You're gonna be super brave.
I love you.
You know we do it so you
don't get sick, right?
Okay, then you're all done.
I'm hoping that this goes a little bit
better than last time.
Last time was pretty
traumatic for both of us.
He only has to get one,
and we're just going in,
getting it done, and then we can leave.
But I feel so bad whenever
the kids get shots.
I'm like, I hate it too.
I totally get it, it's hard.
I told him he can cry if he
wants but he is super brave,
so I think he's gonna do really good.
Okay, Ollie?
- Yeah.
- You're gonna do so good.
(uplifting music)
All right, it's done.
How did it go, baby?
(Oliver whimpering)
Didn't go well.
It was pretty traumatic,
which again, I understand.
It's very scary to get shots.
- They poked a hole in him!
- I know, why'd they do that, huh?
We're all done, but I think now
we're gonna get a little cupcake
because we all need a
little cupcake right now.
(laughs)
-  I'm getting chocolate.
-  That was traumatic
for all of us, I feel like.
- What are you getting?
- Vanilla.
- Vanilla. Maybe we'll get Daddy one.
Poor guy.
-  Hey buddy.
- Hey, I got a shot and it hurt.
-  Aw, I'm sorry.
I'll be sure to give you lots of hugs
and kisses when you get home, okay?
- I'm gonna get a vanilla cupcake.
-  Oh, nice!
- You're gonna get a strawberry one.
-  Okay, I'll
eat the strawberry one.
- And Finn's gonna get chocolate,
and Papa's gonna get chocolate.
-  Pops?
Did you just call Papa Pops?
(Missy laughs)
-  Did you call him Pops?
- Mm-hm.
-  That's a cute name.
I miss you!
- I miss you too.
-  Guess what?
I'm home!
And you're not!
-  We need to get
home and see Daddy, huh?
All right, since Ollie did so good,
he's getting a little cupcake.
Actually we're all getting
a cupcake.
- Little cupcake?
- Apparently they don't have cupcakes.
- We got these giant cakes.
We're gonna be splitting them.
-  There are cupcakes over here.
Let's see what's over here.
All right, I think we've
compromised with this one.
It's got all kinds of cupcakes.
One for Finn, one for Daddy
and Mommy and Papa and Mimi.
That looks good, huh?
All right, hold onto those.
- I wanna eat them.
-  I know.
We're gonna eat them
when we get home, 'kay?
- Hey Ollie!
- What?
- Dad is home!
- Yay!
- Are you so excited? Yeah?
What did you do?
- I got a new ...
- A new what?
- A new Polaris!
- Yes, show it to us!
So I just got home, and this
was sitting in the driveway.
- Look what I got today!
-  Babe!
We got a new toy, you guys.
Look at this.
- I'm pretty proud of
myself for doing this.
-  You found a good deal.
- Do you like it?
-  I do like it.
- It looks really slick, I feel like.
-  Yeah.
The seat's are super nice.
-  There's even
a bar here to hold onto.
-  Yeah yeah, that's neat.
Lots of storage for moving
things around the property.
- It's got a lot more
power than our last one.
-  Yeah, I already
whipped it around.
- Oh, you did?
How was the power steering?
-  Amazing.
- The other one, we're like (panting).
- We didn't even have
power steering on it, yeah.
You like it, dude?
You helped Momma pick this one out?
-  Yeah.
-  Nice, you did a good job.
Safety first.
- Safety first!
-  You all buckled in?
And then look, it has
this little mesh thing
which I like a lot more than those doors.
It feels like it's safer.
- It's totally safer.
The doors come to your knees.
I would literally still fall out.
- Look who else is here!
Finn's been hanging out
with Mimi and Papa all day.
-  He's so tired,
he's like out of it.
- Hi, Finn!
Do you wanna go for a ride?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
All right, we got the boys in.
We got Karma in.
(engine starting)
-  Here we go!
-  Safety first!
- Whoa! It takes a little
more getting used to.
Wow, this drives nice!
- It's like driving a car.
-  How's it feel back there?
- Good!
- Oh my goodness!
(shrieking)
Daddy's being way too crazy.
(laughs)
It feels really nice.
It feels way less bumpy, like comfortable.
- Yeah, it's really
smooth, and the steering.
Oh my gosh!
(wind blowing)
(upbeat music)
-  Hey boys!
I know I've been gone for a couple days,
but I brought something back for you.
- What?
- You wanna see?
Chickens!
That one's yours, and
this one's yours, Finley.
Isn't that a cute little chicken?
- Thank you, Da-da!
- You're welcome.
Finn, can you say thank you?
- Thank you, Da-da!
- Aww, thanks buddy!
No problem.
Ollie, who is on your cupcake?
-  Buzz!
- Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
That's so cool Momma
got you boys cupcakes.
Finn, who's on yours? Can I see?
Oh is that Jessie and Bullseye?
I got the one with all
the little friends on it.
So we got Hamm and Mr. Twinklepits.
You want it off?
-  I think he wants Woody.
-  Oh you want Woody, Finn?
- It's the same thing.
- Same exact cupcake,
different decoration.
That's okay.
Here you go, kiddo.
What do you say?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
(upbeat music)
Aw, you giving Luna some love?
So I am taking Luna out
for a much needed walk.
I put the leash on her and
she is so good on it still.
We haven't been working with her a ton.
She's kinda just been doing her own thing
in the yard and in the house and stuff.
And she's been really good
but when she's on a leash,
she's still a very, very good dog.
One thing though, Luna is
still in heat, you guys.
And I am just flabbergasted because
I believe it's been five weeks now.
We're thinking Karma might be the issue.
So we're actually gonna
try and separate them
for a little bit until she gets fixed.
They cannot have puppies
in case you're wondering.
Because Karma's fixed.
But it might help her a bit.
She's loving the love
though from all the boys.
Hi, Luna!
You're such a good puppy, yes you are.
Oh, did you hurt yourself?
Want me to kiss it?
Is that better?
Look at all the love,
all the love I'm getting.
Finn just climbs up me like a monkey.
(laughs)
Was that fun, Finn?
- Yeah.
- Okay, we'll both walk
her together, okay?
(laughs)
(energetic music)
Look what Ollie can do.
Whoa! That's cool, dude.
Finn, you playing with the pirate ship?
- Yeah.
- All right, it's almost
time for bed, okay?
He's like, "'Kay no."
You gotta go to bed tonight, okay?
Did you have a good day, dude?
- Yeah.
- You wanna help me end the vlog?
- Give this video a thumbs up.
- That's right, give
this video a thumbs up.
