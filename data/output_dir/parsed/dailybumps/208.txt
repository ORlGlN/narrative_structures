good morning guys and it is not the best
way to long right now wherever you are
that's where I wanna be
big hookup in time
just whatever
come to know eclectic here
right actually in the cards and the kids
are home with my mom without this
morning we let her out go potty and our
yard is fully fenced gate is closed but
unfortunately someone just called me and
told me that they have her and that she
got hit by a car they said she's safe
so I don't know exactly what that means
I've seen how badly she's hurt we have
no idea how she's got out if she's okay
we're just trying to find their house
right now you go get her and we're very
stressful I never had anything like this
happen so she started yeah she did she
see but she got hit by a car so I don't
think she's been gone long because I I
can check the cameras she was in the
yard wall models from our home yeah but
this person obviously picked her up and
took her to their house so we are trying
to find her but where I prepare some
computers they have no service I can't
call her right now
or go from the address the address is
very confusing she couldn't even really
explain to you see it looks like I live
on this street but I actually live on
the street
oh my gosh
we found her come here come here Luna
she's okay okay oh that was so stressful
for her Lady Jaye yeah high five yeah
hey guys my mom and she almost gonna
break her poor thing and they picked up
right outside our gate and they gave her
water and she's good hi baby
yeah this is on an adventure
oh gosh let's go off the better of this
really come here come here
that was so scary you guys oh I thought
we lost her belly Lobster
all right crazy dog we're home she's
okay she's okay
hi karma something is like I'm so happy
to see you so happy to see you go ahead
own adventure fight she gotta win the
UPS man opened our gate not crazy ass
bitch
what's the chance that happen such a
small chance yeah he's getting some
water now or puppy Oh gonna thirsty
hunger she went on an adventure four
miles from home oh my gosh I had to
change so hot from running around
outside looking for Luna that was the
scariest thing ever
Zoe had lost her you guys like that
would have been oh my god that would
have been so horrible I wouldn't even
know how to deal with something like
that she saved the lady on the phone it
made it sound like she got hit by a car
but she was definitely in some danger so
I'm glad that they picked her up
although they did take her about five
from home but just there's really no way
of knowing where the dog could have been
from and also like cell service is
really bad out here so that was freaky
I'm glad that her little Luna is not
hurt though sin well on the eighth is
pizza if I feed it to him just take a
bite you are eating your pizzas so good
huh got a good lunch yeah the boys are
having apple slices in pizza slices for
lunch this kid's got taken ap so he's

be fun to make it all fit so it Brian
really s been wanting pumpkin pies for
like days and just like okay what I kind
of I'll try and make it well I have time
by the way I just had done filming a
video so I had to take a shower because
there was one of those kinds of videos
it's not my hair go wet so I'm wearing a
hat now and I'm holding off it so
anyways I'm going to go ahead and it
makes them pumpkin please by the way
from scratch completely from scratch I'm
not even sure if I have all the
ingredients I have the double check but
I'm going to attempt to make pumpkin pie
including the crust which I've never
done the cross because I've heard it's
like a pain in the butt so
you guys I have the best wife ever I've
been craving pumpkin pies and it's like
the perfect day to have it because it's
stormy and raining and my cloudy and I
feel like that's kind of like a fall
treat look at this babe you're making
your own my own custom strap yeah you're
amazing that's incredible
oh it's been joining you up here to play
with your buzzes I think oli that you
have enough buzz layers to go around
can we give him one can we give them
this on the playlist okay he's very
particular so you can have that one and
you got no one lights up well there it
goes whoa just watch your eye this is
just such a good day the kids are
chilling we have the windows open so we
can like hear the waterfall and the rain
making pie that's really cool I did yes
I got her these from williams-sonoma it
came with like three random one that's
cool we like this one gives the crust
more oh no you know you gotta go this
one look at how vintage-inspired that is
that's awesome
you know how I was just talking about
how it was such a great day well that
day has gotten better because we have a
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
on and look at these two boys cuddlin
watching Harry Potter they're so
entranced you guys like Harry Potter
what do you like about it yeah you like
the magic and Dobby no I you do you like
Dobby the house-elf in yeah yes funny
huh hmm yeah we have Harry Potter odd
now love it
pumpkin pie is in the oven and so is
cookies actually all they really want to
cookies I was like why not already here
and our checking on the chicken
that's cutie oh no there's eggs but
they've eaten quite a few of them dang
it
which one of you is eating the eggs one
is the in two is eating is only three
okay grab those three can you keep that
one yeah that might actually be because
the chickens are all on Kickstarter food
which doesn't have as much nutrients as
like their regular food does and so I
think it has slowed down a little bit of
my production and the egg that is good
and probably because they're missing
like some vitamins like calcium and
stuff and so they're choosing their own
eggs to eat because they're missing that
so probably what it is
definitely a bummer that's two eggs a
pie and cooking cookies are cooking
cookie dough is waiting and some cookies
are done these ones got a little bit
overcooked while I was outside with the
chicken but I thought I'd see what all I
think of the cookies he helped me make I
get her it's not hot it's a little warm
I think it's good
how is it oh so good yeah you helped me
make those so you go Finny how are they
ha good little crunchy all right oh my
gosh I amaze myself and we're just
pumpkin pie ah it's really it looks so
good it's actually like we've had it in
three more minutes and pillow firmer

I'm also a baker I think we even show
that we created you guys I do not cook
meals this is my thing I like to bake
