and so she's gonna go pick up a present
but karma was not happy give me that
thing is forget I kept like picking up
his leash and saying okay guys let's go
let's go go to park now he did have to
take off his little eye necklace thing
which he like has anxiety over if he
takes off so he's probably gonna be
freaking out that he just doesn't have
this on he's like wait why are you
taking that off me
you got to reach your hand into this
scary hole to get or anything cool let's
do this
stool can I say I always making
appropriate jokes is this what you want
and now is this what you want to get her
I think so yeah
are just cool cuz this is actually like
built into the like the foot rest but I
didn't realize how like handy it is yeah
and it like can be moved like for
whatever position as she wants it to be
in so we just got pulled over so sad
right now and Bryan Bryan gets really
nervous and I do I got like all shaky
and stuff but actually didn't know what
we were being so good at doing I know
yeah he thought it was a turn on red so
hopefully he's really nice and see that
we don't do anything the first time ever
being pulled over in California I know
it's scary I'm so bummed he did give me
a ticket and it doesn't even say how
much the ticket cost like I have to like
wait for them to email me or mail me
something or something but it sounds
like he was trying to be nice by not
giving you a ticket for turning that's
what they want you to think they're
trying to be nice but literally what it
like the sign took effect at 3:30 and we
literally went past that part I like
what 3:40 yeah yeah so it's like 10
minutes after the sign but whatever
there was a sign I didn't see it and ask
if anyone has ever gotten a ticket for
not obeying a yeah he gave us a ticket
for not obeying a traffic sign so so if
you're in California you ever got that
what you end up paying because it'd be
nice to know yeah I literally have no
idea every time my friends I hear all my
friends getting tickets in California
they're paying like five five hundred to
like a thousand dollars I don't think
it's
yeah well they do stupid things
obviously but that sucks that that just
happened
now I feel like we were totally like
like just driving on comfortably slow
and all sounds like what the heck yeah
