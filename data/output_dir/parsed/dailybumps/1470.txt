guys guys remember like a week or two
ago I filmed something really cool in LA
and I was really really excited the
episode should have been up by now but I
guess there was a mistake and they lost
all the footage on the SD card and I'm
like so afraid that this is gonna happen
to us one day they couldn't use any
footage so I'm headed back to LA to
reshoot and it's kind of funny because
well when you watch the video you'll be
like oh my gosh I can't believe he had
to reshoot that so yeah I have to do
this twice and at first I was like I
don't know if I'm gonna reshoot it just
I'll just tap out but I'm committed I
want you guys to see this it's gonna be
really cool so ah yeah I can't believe
what I'm doing
oh it's rather funny literally got Molly
to sleep and then Carmen just shook
himself and bring his little bell on his
collar huh you're gonna wake the kid up
as I say a little more difficult than
usual but we did it we got asleep

than just 30 minutes which he's been
doing lately how he slept for like two
and half hours a couple days ago and I
woke him up that night he slept amazing
