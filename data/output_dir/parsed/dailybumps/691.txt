good morning good morning morning it's
not morning time for ollie though this
is nap time afternoon time so this
afternoon we are at a tile place and I
am looking to pick out my backsplash
I've got a few ideas of what I want I've
been sending Brian a lot of like ideas
and so I'm pretty like sure why not like
a Potter percent but I know I want it to
look kind of tightly I want it to be
pretty light and bright so not like a
dark backsplash maybe something that's
like gray and has like splashes of or
something that's white it has like
splashes of grey in it um so yeah
we're at this tile place and they
literally have tons of different kinds
which these are really cool like mom
this is the kind of you liked it's like
a different I wonder if these are too
small or if I would want like a bigger
maybe bigger
yeah I like the pattern kind of a cool
idea these are really small small tiles
but they have like bigger ones and we're
literally in a library of title places
and you can even like take these little
slats home and see how they look up
against the granite so that's kind of
cool to see I like something like this I
feel like it's like a brick look it's
got the tile so I just found this and I
actually really like this - it's sort of
like a really cool design
it's got like swatches of the gray it's
got white and not every super pretty
would say that that it's gray with
darker Gray's oh you think so oh yeah oh
maybe you're right it's such a hard
decision and I seriously want to make
the decisions today because I want the
backsplash in ASAP because it's so hard
like walking in my kitchen and not see
anything but I want it to look like look
at this beautiful right you guys
Wow I'm in the seat of a 1954 Ford
something this is an awesome car we're
over at grand Ollie's this is their car
and we're getting ready to do some more
shots do the seats are so comfortable oh
my gosh yeah hey hey yeah can you turn

helping me uh basically unpack and
organize things and she's just really
good at like decorating and organizing
so I'm like aunt Chrissy come over to

faucet in and the way it works it's
really cool you can touch anywhere and
it just turns right on and you touch
anywhere it turns off and that's so cool
and then this will come down I can spray
it of course I've got a big ole farm
sink which I love I can put so many
dishes in this we're gonna hide our
dishes in here ollie yeah yeah I am
waiting for this countertop which this
is actually going to be a large butcher
block which I'm super excited about it's
supposed to be like more on natural wood
look on top of this and I think it'll
look really really cool and then today I
did actually bring home some samples of
backsplashes so I'm still trying to
decide on what I like for these I
brought some of these which I'm not sure
yeah I'm not sure if I'm a fan of these
but here's some different of the subway
tiles that I like here's kind of a fancy
go tile so I'm going to try and make a
decision on this really soon and
hopefully we can get back on up there
very very soon it looks really terrible
without it so hopefully soon we meet
again
hoverboard hey we both got black that's
how we roll man dude straight thuggin
we just finished a bunch of shots in the
super old Ford and now we're just going

which I'm loving looks super super
pretty and now I'm still waiting for a
few pieces that will come in here we'll
end up doing like a big family portrait
here and just a few other things that'll
probably change soon but it's coming
together I'm so happy I ended up moving
this rug this rug was over here and I
love the rug I feel like it's super
super pretty but it is wool and so it
actually is not to me it's not like the
softest rug and the kids were playing on
it because they obviously like to play
out here a lot and so the wool was like
falling apart in their mouth on their
fingers on their feet and it was just
kind of like not working so I ended up
putting in here and I think I'm gonna
get a different rug for in here that way
the kids will have like a spot to play
they won't like dirty the carpet or
anything and this row actually looks
really good in here and it's not like a
bad rug whatsoever I actually really
love the rug this is probably not shy
friendly southern living at its finest
right here Wow
