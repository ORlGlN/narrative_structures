cookie I don't like the chopping point
okay yeah these ones they're easier to
take out huh there you go you guys all

people one two good well more I'm going
to get the apartment too much like she
just she's obsessed with him and so she
cannot leave from lunch she cannot like

she's so good with the kids I can
honestly say she's better with the kids
