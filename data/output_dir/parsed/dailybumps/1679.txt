money guys I am head down to the
cafeteria it's 6:00 in the morning we
are starving and tired
there's coffee on the floor some a
another elevator yeah it's the way said
the one in huh waiting for the cafeteria
open but Missy just posted this on
Instagram oh man he is just so precious
uh-huh cloth bomb I said ah Brian and
his mini-me oh I love this kid eating
some breakfast
this is my view right here look at that
look at that little guy
your buddy he's snoozing oh hey has he
had breakfast so he's in a milk coma
ready for the boob good morning buddy
you wakin up that yes or no you ready to
go home boy and see your bedroom we have
it all decorated for you yeah I hope you
like anchors there is hi mom how'd you
get that arm through I wrapped that
super tight
you're like Harry Houdini in here huh
put that arm back in there tuck that
back in there tuck that back in there
all right oh you know what he kind of
looks like when he's all wrapped up like
this he looks like the little baby and
the when we drew his name reveal I'll
swallow that ha put that horn back in
there come on trust me boy look at him
do you smile ah
mmm mmm is that a poopy face yeah
releasing a good one he's doing a
football hold he's getting his milk on
again he's got these little rash thing
that nurse came in said they're
completely normal it's just like a
different kind of newborn
kind of like baby acne if you're so bad
over about that but it doesn't seem to
bother him too much yeah look I'm he's
loving that he's like touchdown football
baby
it's hard work taking care of two
parents where there's not a baby so mean
Oliver are just hanging out doing some
nursing and feeding and everyone else's
Brian's passed out yep on my bed but he
didn't get well he slept in this chair
and I felt like sitting up a little bit
today and Cassie's been passed out all
morning because she was up all night to
kind of helping us take care of Oliver
and all taking kind of shifts and
sleeping and stuff but really really
hoping to go home today
we're just waiting we want to get an
echo done on this heart just to make
sure that maybe he did grow out of that
issue that he was having when we had the
anatomy scan at 20 weeks so we were just
kind of waiting for that and if we get
that done then we're all cleared to go
home so I cannot wait to actually get
this little boy in my home and just take
care of him so excited everything's just
been going super good and it's just
amazing baby like he rarely cries and
when he does it's so easy to figure it
out so far he's just just been really
really awesome baby no we're giving tons
of people baby fever right now because
he's just so cute on baby so we're gonna
get out the poppy for Brian to use a
little monkey bumpy oh that's nice yeah
hey buddy hey he just had a really good
feat in so he is nice and comfy now huh
she hasn't been up in a while okay it's
okay baby
just breathe slow slow and steady baby
slow and steady do you think it's gonna
be pretty gnarly going up the stairs at
home she might not be coming down I
think been with his dad we found a place
in the cafeteria that actually does
custom sandwiches so that is like way
better than what I've actually been
eating here so I'm eating a club
sandwich with avocado on sourdough which
is amazing and a little Ollie is on his
usual diet milk milk and he's got a lot
of it so if you want more I'm face her
yep
yes so um the peas just came in and they
checked his heart they don't hear a
murmur anymore which is good cause it's
transitional it's just something that
they really can't explain and whatever
but um he is getting an echo done on his
heart because when he was in the womb we
found out that one of his artery was um
a tad dilated um and although it seemed
to be going down they definitely want to
check him before we leave we want to go
home but we want to get the echo done so
um he actually just came in the room and
said he's gonna take him away to get it
done so we'll see actually how his
little heart is pumping in there it'll
be interesting because every time we've
seen his insides they've been inside
Missy yeah I can't believe this goes
inside me I know right
I mean I do believe it that I don't it
was weird because when he was inside you
he was all black and white and yeah
see-through that's how we saw now you
just like grew this skin came out this
beautiful beautiful pink little baby so
we're doing it understand
and anything else well I don't know
about it what are these for
I need to have an EKG on my door okay
it's been nice and warm
let's do nice and relaxed
do we know how things are looking good
that children's has not filled the final
you can see though the little dilation
somebody called it that buddy
I heard you did good does he have a big
heart she's saying I didn't want to tell
him anything when you say oh he said
there's nothing to be concerned about at
all
okay you're the annihilation he's like I
was like okay he's like does they just
called it that yeah like it was like try
like give me ease but I'm by saying like
it's nothing but he didn't want to say
it's nothing in our psyche yeah sit down
baby and you said you're gonna come and
take all your staples oh god I'm so
scared everyone says it's not it doesn't
hurt me I'm so scared
really
such my finger and oh oh
the bed was also very warm aches except
good for him like AHA toasty warm ha
just like loving it
she's gonna put some coconut oil on
little Oliver he's getting these little
scratches from like his umbilical cord
or his bracelet I'm getting a couple of
massages a change here lately
