boom goes the dynamite our dad good
morning guys Winnie we're up bright and
early today and we are headed to a out -
minions yes you got a little minion toy
we're headed to a cardiologist or both
Finn and Oliver we're hopefully gonna
get results for Finn and probably get an
echo for ollie done which is nice that
we're getting this all taken care of
little nerve-wracking to have something
like this like hanging over your head so
we're getting in and hopefully it won't
take too long
good morning people of the Internet I
just used a lot of things to get ready
for the day just now yes I admit I used
every single one of these things but I
mean come on toothpaste that's a
necessity you guys and yes I have two
brushes one that's for my facial hair
and one is for my hair but I need to
make sure that I look my absolute best
because one of my very good buddies is
in town today the one and only Jared

that guy he is in town for business and
tonight we are gonna go hang out and
we're going to go do something fun in LA
and then he's going to come back here
we're gonna get to hang out for a day so
that should be really cool but I'm all
ready for the day this morning I'll go
show you my outfit in this room so you
can see I'm wearing my gray colored
shirt I rolled up the sleeves a bit and
I also have some ocean blue joggers on
because I didn't want to wear jeans I
don't think you can wear jeans actually
so I was like well these aren't jeans
but they still look cool and they're
super comfy and I'm gonna wear black
shoes - I'm not gonna wear white my
white no-show socks
I'm all ready for the day now I got a
long drive ahead of me
so we just did an EKG for both the boys
and I was able to show you Finley but
Ollie here didn't not like that at all
yeah he had an EKG and he was not happy
but I think they finally got it after a
lot of screaming but now we're just
waiting for the doctor I don't know if
they're going to do an echo on him today
but I feel like he would not cooperate
if they did we are done with the
cardiologist Ollie how was it look good
how was the doctor you liked the doctor
did she listen to your heart and listen
yeah yeah he did not like that guy like
the doctor at all he screamed and cried
it was really sad we got a lot of stuff
figured out so I'll probably talk about
it another time but now we were eating

you're all your dinner is just me and
the boys tonight
Finn is definitely wanting to look nurse
24/7 and that is so hard to do when you
don't have someone to help watch that
kid and I know probably moms do this all
day long but for me I have a husband
that's usually here all day long and
we're just tag teaming it so it's
definitely different when I don't have
Brian around but it's nice that
babywearing is an option because without
it I feel like I would go crazy I would
have no way to control my very very busy
toddler and this way I have two free
hands I can make him dinner and I can
stop him from jumping off the couch a
thousand times
um but yeah we're just gonna we're
eating some dinner right now and I
haven't been talking about the fact that
Brian is on Dancing with the Stars well
he's not on it he's watching Dancing
with the Stars but I assume he's gonna
be on TV so I'm really excited I'm
planning on actually putting all a to
bed before it comes on here just because
it comes on at 8:00 p.m. and it's kind
of late hopefully I can get him into bed
I'm excited to see him I'm excited that
he gets to do this and I'm excited that
he gets to like meet all these cool
people and I think it's really me I'm
hoping that he's actually able to blog a
lot of it because I know a lot of these
places don't really let like cameras in

you to vlog it so I can see it myself
