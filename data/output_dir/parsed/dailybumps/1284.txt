Austin's vlog from the knife Knowles

just talking about how a buddy of his
was diagnosed with MS and insurance
isn't helping them out and so they're
running a really cool campaign which i
think is really really dope of them
shirts and then they're just going to
give all the proceeds to them to help
them out with like medicine and stuff so
I just bought two shirts and then I
realized I have no merchandise from any
of my friends so I ordered a shirt from
Ellie and Jared and Colin and Katie just
got shirts designed so we have some
coming from them as well we have this
cool little like family community on
YouTube and the thing is is like we're
all just genuinely friends like people
some people probably think that it's
just a business thing and we're all just
we all just help each other out for
business reasons but that's not it at
all we're actually all genuinely friends
so I just I love supporting my friends
and helping him out and seeing him
succeed as well so that's a French is
