something to do and she's like but it
was no big deal but in the end I have a
lot to do today we have sent a couple of

what up guys I thought I was gonna start
to cool off because apparently it's
officially fall now right go drink your
pumpkin spice lattes and your chai tea
lattes because it's fall time the sucky
thing about California though is these
trees will always be green it takes a
long time for them to actually like turn
yellow so we're not even gonna see fall
until like our winter yeah it's 95
degrees out spend really nice out lately
but I guess it's gonna be a hot one
today today is really exciting you guys
because we're filming something
completely different and it's not for
Missy's Channel it's not for this
channel it's not for my channel and it's
not for baby League it's for something
pretty special and I think it's a pretty
big deal and I'm really excited it's
gonna be something very different from
things we've ever done but we're really
excited because all you guys are gonna
love it I don't know when it's gonna be
released I think they said our air date
might be early next year even we're
gonna try and get all the shots done
today it's gonna be a really large feat
it's gonna be a task but we're up for it
I don't even know what what is this how
did you do that I was just telling Brian
I was like I cleaned the house perfectly
yesterday like it was like mopped and
swept and today look at this it's just
gross like a it feels gross like the
whole house just like and keep eye
I keep fighting like piles of things I
have to sweep and that's just what it's
like we have a baby huh you're clean one
day and it's miss messy the next but oh
man I just had a blast hanging out with
Josh yesterday is the first time we've
met we've talked a bunch on Twitter and
stuff you guys didn't see yesterday's
vlog go check it out he's a really cool
guy
you know we we talked to YouTube we
talked the future we talked about family
and relationships and I'm just so stoked
for him and Colleen because they're
going to be getting married in the
summertime that's one of the things I
love about being on YouTube is we've
created so many amazing real friendships
with people
look you guys I got a little baby bundle
of sandwiches oh holy cow it's hot and I
love on this sandwich Missy's mom is
actually headed over to help us do some
filming and stuff so I grabbed her a sub
to ma'am burritos and sandwiches top two
favorite food I gotta say they're simple
that's so good I got start this car
excited like I'm good right now
funny story like I said yesterday I
never use my phone to vlog but then I
forgot my camera so now I'm vlogging
with my phone I'm with my mom and we
just got done filming and so we are
running some errands we're going back to
the makeup store I feel like that's
really embarrassing that we're saying
that but we didn't like the stuff that
we got so we're gonna look at some other
things look at all this light in our
living room buddy we actually whoa we
have a big window here but the house
came with these really just horrible
blinds and they're like impossible to
adjust so we actually rolled it up and
tied them with a little bit of twine so
now we have a lot more light in this
room which is nice because see it always
seemed really dark in this area just
needs a lot of natural light you know
hey karma what are you doing you playing
with the ball that's all these Balcombe
airily karma
alleys gotcha fall all I threw for you
me a nice kid we're actually going to
probably get new blinds for this window
this window all these windows down here
just because we can't adjust them
letting any light or anything and it's
kind of frustrating
Oh through it all so I'm not used to
blogging with my phone so I'm guessing I
got like this down yeah through really
careful because this doesn't have as
wide of a screen so I can cut off my
head and sub so I don't like volume I
thought I knew my camera but I totally
forgot it at home it's working fine but
I forgot it so Just My Luck
