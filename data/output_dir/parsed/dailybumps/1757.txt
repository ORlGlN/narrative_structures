shoes but those are definitely suffers I
told it doesn't really matter because
we're going to Walmart and people are
wearing a lot worse right yeah so we're
at warmer and I just found it super cool
they're like warmer night lights and
they plug into the wall so they like
they look like this and you can like you

arcades so that one yeah okay this one
has seahorse area seahorse
oh it's upside down okay seahorse and a
starfish look at this one surf Sun and

all that that's so cool no I can see
they're perfect for his room I like this
one Mike um how many can we get this was
so cool because it kind of matches his
room yeah oh my god that's funny I kind
of like the biblical someone anchors on
it oh my god I don't know actually
he said we also have to get comma dog
food and I don't know how I'm gonna put
it in the cart because I am like a mess
oh my gosh how is this away Oh 15 pounds
baby you should have done that way to
make me feel like a man there's way too
many popcorn choices even like popcorn
oh I really only like kettle corn yeah
and these are cool these new pop-up
bowls cuz you know you know how you you
make popcorn and then the first thing
you do is you put it in a bowl this like
totally save you a step it just gives
you a bowl I know you like butter Missy
Brian he's calling that no I just said
that you better this looks good I think
we should get this one I wanted to show
you guys because a subscriber actually
had mentioned these and told me that I
should try these because I was looking
for like a low-calorie ice-cream treat
and I found these skinny cow vanilla and
chocolate sandwiches that look really
good
and the only 150 calories per sandwich
so I could totally swing that in my diet
and they look they look pretty good a
lot Missy said she was gonna eat them so
it might not last very long
I will see and totally don't knock on me
right now but um have you guys seen
those raps from McDonald's well they're
like amazing oh and it goes all the way
around so you can take it off is the
coolest thing I know okay and it's got
like all these yummy vegetables in it
and um it's one 360 calories and it's so
good and I'm so obsessed with it and
like the tortilla is like amazing what
is the this is chili sweet chili mm-hmm
I actually instagrammed a photo of all
of our different options for the little
nightlight thing and everyone said to
choose the blue one and I just didn't
like that one because like there's
already so much blue in here I didn't
want to clash with the other blue so I
pretty much asked that question and
everyone says blue but I have a few
people did say this one too because um
it says surf and it has that on it it
says sand it has an anchor it has this
cool net a seashell it has a beach sign
a starfish it's just like so cute
but right here and just perfect and then
it has a little switch it's so cute I
think it like I think it just stands out
a little bit more on the wall yeah yeah
I did too okay so I wanted to address
something real fast
and it's something that actually has
been kind of a hot topic for like this
whole week now obviously when you're on
YouTube you get people that love you you
get people that hate you you know you
get people like all kinds of different
people in the comments and stuff like
that
um well today we got oh thank you for
the ball karma here you go today we got
an interesting comment on Missy's
channel of the video that I did with her
recently um and it was so sweet the
person said I hope your husband dies oh
not nice and that's so nice
no it's not nice but you know that's
kinda just something that comes along
with being on YouTube and putting
yourself out there and honestly I mean
I'm the kind of person that reads that
and I literally laugh like I laugh like
Missy told me and she didn't want it or
she didn't want to tell me I was like
just tell me and she read it and I
laughed and I was like that's ridiculous
because there's you know there's just
some people in this world that will have
like so much hate and so much anger and
are so like dissatisfied with themselves
that they want to spread that to other
people and YouTube is a way to do that I
guess but it honestly it doesn't get to
me at all and I kind of understand that
you know when you're on YouTube that
that's kind of just what comes along
with with the game but it's funny
because this week kind of been like a
topic on the Shaytards he mentioned in a
couple videos videos ago why I daily
vlog he mentioned you know how they kind
of they get comments and they get people
who scrutinize their life and um people
who you know tell them that they're bad
parents and they beat their kids and
stuff like that and they know it's not
true and so they kind of had to address
that and say you know like when you're
on YouTube you kind of gotta let that
roll off you also on its Judy's time she
was mentioning how she always reads
through all the comments and she
understands that there's people that
don't like her or scrutinize her or like
tell her how she needs to live her life
or they hate on her and send her just
like stupid stuff like that and she kind
of just mentioned how um you know well
at least that person gave me a view we
don't want any negative things on our
videos obviously but we want our videos
to be a place like a positive place
where people can actually like have real
discussions in the comments and and talk
and enjoy and get entertainment out of
our videos I guess irma is just loving
all right now hi boy you at your ball
huh okay oh we just did this thing for
Missy's bum date where she's like
throwing popcorn everywhere and like
that's how we reveal the title of the
bum date so bright ideas it's not his
pop look enough love for the carpet but
look at these funny pictures I got
here's our first attempt and she's got a
total lazy eye going on that she throws
it and it's not enough popcorn I mean
that one's actually okay but I don't
know make that one and then that one
it's going crazy mm-hmm and then this
one it's funny what's funny is like
right in my mouth I like the other one
