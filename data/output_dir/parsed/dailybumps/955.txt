good morning guys it's been a rough
morning I'm outside with Ollie right now
say hi ollie my little stinker bottom
yeah it's actually been a great morning
because we revealed the name today and
it's been really exciting seeing
everyone's reaction how much they love
the name and it's just been really
really awesome and I even got ready this
morning and I did my bump date but today
all has just been really rough been
rough with all ages you kind of woke up
demanding things and like begging for
things and screaming and we've been like
working on it all morning trying to just
you know work through this and he's just
a baby and he you know be a little crazy
sometimes minutes ago I saw that he had
Brian's Apple watch and I went to get it
and he ran from me and I tried to grab
it and he literally chucked it and look
what happened
he literally smashed it
I literally just like broke down crying
so I felt so bad horse Brian Brian's
like it's fine like he's got protection
on it it's okay like things are things
and it doesn't really matter
he's a baby and things are gonna break
and that's gonna happen when you have a
kid it just sucks I just felt really bad
and I really just started crying my eyes
out I just felt really bad because I
should have grabbed it faster but when I
went to grab it he ran and I just I
don't know I I feel like it's my fault
but I know it's not like I felt like I
could have predicted that he was going
to do that and it in that if he did do
it normally probably would have landed
like on carpet but it hit the fireplace
and it just shattered it's just been a
rough morning with ollie and then he
broken up a watch today's like my last
day here really spend with ollie and I
was like I'm just gonna spend the day
with him we're gonna go swimming and
we're gonna play we're gonna hang out
courts had to fill my bump date but I
just was gonna like
have fun with him and he just woke up in
a being a little sinker bottom he did
get a timeout for breaking a nap watch
like I said Brian's not like upset or
anything it's just a thing but I'm upset
I just feel bad his fort phase oh my
gosh was actually yeah there's like a
chunk missing there's like a big ol
chunk missing right there it's literally
shattered oh good but I was gonna say
like not what he threw it's the fact
that he threw something yeah and that we
asked for it and then yeah it's like
because obviously he's - he's been crazy
- what really crazy
obviously used to and so we're work like
we discipline and stuff like that but
but the thing is is that we disciplined
him not on the value of the objects but
of the action
exactly thank you poor older
punish him because he threw the watch
yeah you have to punish him just like if
you were to throw a toy and because look
at him literally Terry oh yeah we gotta
wrap this up so we can discipline him
but like honestly like it's all about
like if your baby if your kid is running
away from you at the park like that's
annoying but if he's running away from
you in a parking lot like that's
dangerous so you have to plan with him
running away from you at the park
because yeah this might have been a
hundred dollars but this also could have
been thrown at the baby's head's a big
deal yeah so it's just you know it's
just about discipline of knowing how to
discipline and not over disciplining
just her there was a watch but still
obviously yeah it was really upsetting
can dead abacus can you say sorry okay
thank you
no he doesn't know what it means but
yeah pick that up and then mom and dad I
got a telling you again okay Wow
seriously you guys all return to and
then immediately was like I need to ramp
it up a notch if the terrible twos have
officially begun and it's kind of
throwing us for a loop and we're
learning how to parent a little bit
differently in and whatnot in I
yeah I love the kid but he's crazy he's
not crazy he's just 2 years old it's
been kind of a rough morning Missy's
just a little emotional about it to be
just because she's pregnant he's okay
now I'm okay we're all okay
the watch is fine I have Apple care they
will replace it for me so it's not a BD
right now I'm actually headed to go get
some lunch I'm going to Jersey Mike's to
get a sandwich because we haven't been
in a while I will say to you guys check
