- And look at poor little Finn.
He's still just the tiredest--
- Boo!
- Grumpiest baby.
- Boo!
- This one's not grumpy, huh?

Good morning!
It is a beautiful, crisp, cold morning.
And I have a busy, busy day
ahead of me, but I'm excited!
It's gonna be a fun day, as you can see.
I'm in my riding clothes.
I'm going riding.
So I feel like today's
vlog is actually gonna be
kind of a day in the life,
not a normal day in my life,
but a day in the life of my life.
Because, one, I am using this spare camera
which actually has a crack in it.
My voice is so bad,
guys, I sound ridiculous.
And this camera doesn't have a strap,
so it'll be amazing if this camera
doesn't like fall and break.
'Cause I have to put that
on my wrist all the time.
But anyways, before I go riding today,
I'm actually getting a Brazilian Blowout,
and if you don't know or haven't noticed,
my hair is like really hard to manage.
It's not any harder than
probably any other person's hair
who is like curly, frizzy, like ugh,
but I'm also super challenged at it.
Like, I can't do my hair, so I'm getting
a Brazilian Blowout, and
that just relaxes my hair
and calms it down so that
when I do go to do it,
it's not as difficult.
So first things first,
Brazilian Blowout, then horse.
And...
Voila!
I have straight, straight hair right now.
With the Brazilian, I can
actually wash it when I get home,
and it'll just be a lot calmer,
and it won't be hard to,
like, not make look so crazy.
Like, I can actually let it
air dry, which is really nice.
So, yay, thank you Michelle, once again.
She's my hair lady, hair genius.
Look at me, I'm going riding, woo-hoo!
We just had a little bit of a
scuffle getting the bridle on.
He just, sometimes I'm
like, just a little rude,
and I don't always know how
to say, stop it! (chuckles)
But we finally got it, huh?
We are gonna ride for a
bit, and then he's actually
getting a massage today, huh?
And then once he gets a massage,
he actually can't be ridden
for, like, all of the rest of
the day and then the next day.
So I just gotta ride him one more time.
The arena's a little
wet, so gotta be careful,
but it should be just
a fun, fun little ride
before you get your massage.
Sound good?
I've been trotting around a little bit,
and it is definitely a little slippery,
so I gotta be careful.
Also, I forgot my helmet.
We're probably just gonna walk,
maybe trot a little bit, not too much.
But yeah, he's so good, guys.
We've come so far in the last two months.
Just like, kind of bonding, and learning
each other's cues, and what we want.
And he's relaxed, definitely a lot,
but he still definitely has work to do,
just like I do.
He still needs muscle, and he likes
to keep his head really high.
Oh, right now he's
relaxing, which is nice.
But it's just been such
a fun little experience,
and I'm just enjoying
having a horse so much.
But yeah, we're just gonna trot around,
and loving, loving, loving
English, which is so funny,
'cause I was like, I want a Western horse,
and I want to trail, and I love Western,
but definitely love
English, so for all of you
who are like, "You should try English."
Well, I did, and I loved it.
The ground is very wet,
so that's like the wettest
it is right there, but you can see,
it's just like very mushy, slippery.
The trail would be so nice today,
but don't really have time for that.
'Cause he's getting a massage,
he's a spoiled little
horsey, so. (chuckles)
He's so funny, too, 'cause he knows
when I want to go over to that stand,
'cause that's where my phone is,
my water is, my camera is,
so he'll often just walk
over there, like, you wanna
stop and stay here? (chuckles)
All right, I'm gonna set up and see
if I can ride around a little bit.
(pleasant music)
Slipped a little there, huh?
Slipped a little.
(pleasant music)
Isn't he so cute? Aww.
He's so funny, he knows that I want to go
straight to my camera
right now. (chuckles)
So I don't think I just
caught that on camera,
but the camera was set
up, and I was walking
pretty far down to the arena,
and he's doing really good,
I definitely felt him slide a couple times
'cause of the, when he's
turning, and the ground's
just a little mush, I
just have to be careful.
He always spooks at
this windmill over here,
and it's so annoying.
He's actually spooked so bad once
that I like got control
of him pretty quickly,
but then he spooked again,
because he was like,
still totally freaked out about
it, and I totally fell off.
(laughs) It's the first time
I've ever fallen off a horse.
It was probably one of
the most graceful falls,
'cause I was like,
spooked, I was like okay,
lost my balance a little
bit, spooked again,
I was like, all right, I'm just gonna go,
and I just like fell on my butt.
But he just spooked again so
hard because of this windmill.
I'm gonna zoom in and show you.
The wind is already scary
enough to these horses.
When the wind blows, that
thing starts blowing harder,
and he hates it!
He did not like the
windmill just a second ago,
and spooked pretty hard, but I'm not sure
if you guys saw it on camera.
I'll have to go back and
check, but yeah, he's like,
"Can we be done now?
"I don't like the windmill,
and I've slid a couple times."
So I'm gonna put him away, and get ready
for our massage, yay!
Nacho, are you gonna open the gate?
Show me, there you go.
He's so funny.
All right, Nacho is officially
getting his massage.
This is Claire, and she
has taught me so much
about horses and their muscles,
and how important it is to get massages.
And you might think that's like crazy,
but it has done wonders.
You can watch, she'll put pressure,
just a little pressure on like her back,
and he just like, shivers
'cause of the pain.
-  And I work
it out, so there's not,
no longer there.
- Yeah, so she works out
all his aches and pains,
and then he just behaves so much better
once we're riding, huh?
He's actually pretty good,
he's not like too bad off,
but there's another horse in here that,
when he gets a massage, he kicks
'cause he's just in so much pain,
but by the time he is done, totally fine.
Perfect.
(pleasant music)
All right, he's all done!
I didn't get a chance to show you in pain,
but it's like all good now.
-  No twitching.
- Look at that, yeah, before it was,
like, all twitchy and crazy.
He was kind of being a little brat,
but (chuckling) he's happy now.
Yeah (chuckles), thank you!
All right, I am now back with
the boys and check it out!
We just had lunch together, huh?
-  Yeah.
- I just had something funny
that I noticed about Finn.
You know, it's just Dad life, it's fine.
He's wearing a nine-month jacket.
- Yeah.
-  And Ollie's shoes.
-  Yeah.
-  (laughs) Couldn't find shoes,
couldn't find a jacket.
- It's the world we live in.
- Sometimes things just
aren't where they are,
and so he's like, "All
right, just gonna grab 'em."
- They just need to have one
size fits all for all kids.
-  They really do.
- And they can just throw--
-  They should make like shoes
adjustable to, like, kid's sizes.
-  Uh-oh!
- Wait a second, am I just
coming up with a genius idea?
'Kay, I think that needs to be a thing.
Adjustable shoe sizes. (laughs)
So the boys are actually gonna stay here
while me and Bryan go
on a little day date,
and Auntie is gonna come pick you up,
and take you on a fun
little adventure, huh?
And Mommy and Daddy are
gonna go on a fun date, 'kay?
You guys all have to
check out Cassie's channel
to see how her day goes,
'cause she's actually
going to have four kids.
It's gonna be interesting, but anyways.
'Kay, you guys have a fun day, okay?
-  Okay.
-  Have fun with Auntie.
Oh, look at that.
Have fun with Auntie.
- Okay.
- First up on our day
date is pedicures, yay!
- Yeah.
- And this is where me
and Kelsey usually go,
and they gave us, like
our own private room
so we can talk.
- Nice warm neck pillow.
-  I know, and tea.
I think we need to do this more often.
- Uh, yeah, I'm not gonna say no to that.
-  (chuckles)
We're having a nice time relaxing,
and I think the boys are having a blast.
All right, dinner is
basically done. (laughs)
- We did it, we conquered dinner.
It's always a good feeling
when you conquer dinner.
- We had pedicures, and dinner,
and we're like, this is so weird.
We've never done this during the daytime.
We normally, like--
- Missy's like, "Do you wanna
hop over to Hobby Lobby?"
I'm like, "Hey, let's get lit!" (laughs)
- My sister still,
she's been with the kids
at a playground for three hours.
I don't know how she's
doing it, but she's like,
"Yeah, I think we're
gonna do something else."
I'm like, "Okay, we're
gonna go to dinner then."
- Yeah, she will never go back
to that playground, though.
- Yeah--
- That's too long to
be there for one time.
- Who stays there for three hours?
- Then you never go
back, 'cause you hate it.
- I'm like there for an
hour, and then I'm like,
"Hey kids, it's time to go.
"It's time to go." (chuckles)
But yeah, we've had a
really, really fun day, huh?
- Yeah, it's been really cool hanging out.
- So fun.
But yeah, we are totally
going to Hobby Lobby.
- Okay, let's go!
- Because I really want
to go to Hobby Lobby.
(chuckles) So let's go!
We are back from our
date, and I gotta say,
this has been an interesting vlog,
I've been the only one to
hold the camera and vlog.
And there hasn't been a
lot of other people in it,
other than Bryan.
I am now home, I am getting
the kids some water,
and they're taking a bath.
They've been playing all
day, and they are filthy.
So I'm doing bath time,
and then it's bedtime.
I have got the tiredest, silliest,
cutest little baby right here.
(Finn groaning)
Are you the tiredest baby?
(Finn whining)
Yes, he is. (softly chuckles)
Ollie, how much fun did
you have with Auntie today?
- A lot of fun.
-  A lot of fun?
And what did you do?
- I went to Uptown Jungle.
-  Oh wow, and so
you went to a playground,
you played, played,
played, played, played?
- Yeah, but I didn't go rock climbing,
which I really wanted.
- And look at poor little Finn.
He's still just the tiredest--
- Boo!
- Grumpiest baby.
- Boo!
- This one's not grumpy, huh?
(relaxed music)
And that's how Momma does it.
Both kids are asleep, and I am so ready
to just veg out on the couch.
Bryan's actually playing
video games right now,
but I'm gonna get some snacks,
and we're gonna watch a movie.
And it's just so nice to be home
after a very, very busy day.
It was kind of like
nonstop, but it was fun,
it was fun, fun day.
Not the usual, but super
fun, and so awesome
that my sister took the kids for us,
and me and Bryan just got
to have a fun day out.
But anyways, I'm gonna go
ahead and end this video.
Let me know what you thought of this.
This was kind of like a video that's
like all about me, I guess.
But anyways, I hope you enjoyed it.
Let me know down in the
comments if you enjoyed it.
Let me know if you're
a mom, and if you would
like to see more stuff like this.
I'm super interested.
But for now, I will see
you guys in our next video.
Bye!
(upbeat music)
