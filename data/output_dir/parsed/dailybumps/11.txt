- Move your foot.
-  Finn.
-  No foot, okay that's--
-  Yeah, Finn uses all
limbs when making cookies.
There you go.
-  Good job.
-  Oh! (laughs)

Good morning!
- Good morning!
- How's it going, buddy?
- Good.
- Good. This morning, Ollie
wanted to show you guys
something he's so proud of, and honestly,
he did an amazing job.
You ready?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Snowman!
-  Your snowman art!
- This is my snowman.
-  This is awesome.
- Look at my snowman.
-  Why is he sad, Ollie?
(Ollie laughs)
What?
- Because.
- I think I may be missing something.
Why is the snowman so angry, or sad?
- Because he got hurt.
-  He got hurt?
- Yeah.
-  Was it too hot
out and he started melting?
- Yeah.
-  (laughs) You got another snowman
over here, this one's cool.
-  Yeah.
-  Did you choose those buttons?
-  Yeah.
- Wait, so did you choose
green 'cause you know
that's my favorite color?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. (laughs)
- And look at my little--
-  Your little carrot nose?
-  Yeah.
-  That is so good, Ollie.
We have started getting
so much preschool art.
It's been so cool, like him learning
the letter g with his goat.
Or p...
Worm...
It's so cool!
This is also our little grocery list here,
on the side of the fridge.
We seem to be missing something.
Always La Croix, I
always need more of this.
All right, Ollie, did you know
that you are on a very
important mission today?
- What?
- We need to make some
Valentine's Day cookies, huh?
- Yeah!
- Yeah! So I think you are gonna
go on a mission with Momma,
and you gotta pick out all the
cool Valentine's Day candies
and decorations for cookies, okay?
- Yeah.
- Do you know what
Valentine's Day is all about?
- Yeah, it's about hearts.
- Hearts, and what else?
- Cookies.
- Cookies, what else?
- Snowman.
- Snowman? No, it's not.
(Ollie chuckles)
Valentine's Day is about telling
the person you love that you love them.
So be sure you guys are doing that today.
I'm sure we have some cool plans cooked up
for Momma for Valentine's Day, huh?
You got a present for her?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah!
- Good morning, guys!
I've got Ollie now, and we are
actually headed to the store.
What are we getting, Ollie?
- Valentine's cookies!
- Yeah! Valentine's Day cookies!
Let's go get it.
(upbeat music)
So we thought it would be a super fun idea
to make Valentine's Day cookies.
And so Ollie wants to do, I
think, sugar cookies, right?
- Yeah.
- And we're gonna, so we need to get stuff
for sugar cookies and we need to get stuff
to decorate the sugar cookies, right?
And we're gonna make
them all Valentine's-y
since it's Valentine's Day.
So we are super excited about Valentine's,
so we are gonna go get stuff now.
This looks like the right
aisle, Ollie, if you ask me.
All of this looks so good, huh?
- Yeah.
(Missy chuckles)
Look, Valentine's Day sprinkles.
-  (gasps) We
need some of those, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Oh yeah, those look perfect.
What are those ones?
-  These are heart ones.
-  Those are heart ones?
Those are perfect! Nice find, Ollie!
Definitely going to need some red icing,
but I kinda like the idea
of some white icing, too.
Does that sound good?
-  Yeah.
- All right, I think we've
got all of our decor,
and I went ahead and just
bought some of the, like,
kind that's easy to make, little baggies.
Just in case maybe we get too tired
and we just wanna do the easy kind, right?
Plus, Mommy's not very good
at making sugar cookies,
and if I try and make them,
they might turn out terrible,
and then we'll have to use those ones.
But we definitely need some butter.
And then I think we have just
about everything we need.
Right?
- Yeah.
- All right, that was a successful trip
to the grocery store.
We gotta get home so we can make these.
Let's get the car loaded up, 'kay?
- 'Kay.
-  We're home, Finn!
Where are you? Hi, Bud!
Aww.
-  Did you miss us?
-  You guys are
so cute! We missed you.
Hi, bud.
-  Hey, did you
find some cool stuff
for Valentine's Day?
- Did you take a good nap?
-  Yes.
-  Yes!
- You took a good nap?
- Yeah.
(kisses)
- Oh, wow. It is freezing out here!
Not freezing, but it is very cold.
Check out our pool, it's
actually all heated right now,
so you can see the steam coming out of it.
It looks so cool.
So tonight we're gonna be
doing some Valentine's Day
cookies with the boys,
but before we eat cookies
we should probably have dinner.
So I'm gonna be grilling
in my grill tonight,
which I definitely have to clean.
I've got some steaks that I seasoned up,
and then I also have a yellow
pepper and orange pepper
that I tossed in olive
oil and salt and pepper.
And I'm just gonna throw
those right on the grill too,
and see how it all turns out.
And then I think Missy's gonna be making
some sweet potato fries.
Sounds so yummy.
I don't know if you can
see on the camera...
A little bit, there's
definitely some steamage
coming from the pool.
Click the thumbs up if you guys wanna see
some pool videos on our channel soon.
I think that's gonna have to happen.
(slow beat music)
- We should eat with the hearts ears on.
-  We should?
I think that's a good idea,
what do you think, Finn?
- Yeah.
- You guys, it's dinnertime,
and we are donning our hearts.
(Missy chuckles)
Because we're all so in love
with each other, aren't we?
-  Yeah.
- Yeah, we are all eating dinner,
and I think we need to cheers, right?
-  Yeah.
- We always gotta cheers.
-  Ready? To Valentine, or to love.
-  To love and family.
(exhales)
- Momma.
-  Huh?
- I love you 'cause I love you.
-  Aw, I love you.
(Bryan chuckles)
-  Our boys.
(upbeat music)
All right, what is it time for, boys?
- Cookie dough!
-  Woo!
-  Making cookie dough!
We are making some
Valentine's Day cookies.
-  Are you gonna help me?
Good job.
-  Nice!
As you can see in our kitchen,
we are very, very good chefs,
we make everything from scratch.
We don't use any pre-made mixes.
-  Wait, I want to feel it.
-  What's it feel like?
- It feels like cotton candy.
(Bryan and Missy laugh)
-  All right,
Ollie, put in the flour.
Nice.
- 'Kay, now we need to
mix this up really good.
Finn, you wanna try?
-  What's this?
-  Here, Finn, you
mix it up with the whisk,
and Ollie will do the egg, okay?
-  Hey, there's a little bit more.
-  There's a little
bit more in there? (laughs)
-  Mix it really good.
- It's very specific.
Wants to make sure he
completely gets it clean.
- 'Kay, Ollie do you wanna
mix it a little, too?
-  Mmm, good job!
-  (laughs) Now we're
dropping in some melted butter.
- Can you put that in?
-  There we go.
-  Harder. Good job.
-  There you go.
-  Now take your
other hand, and then we're
just gonna pull it apart.
(Ollie cries out)
(Bryan and Missy laugh)
That's a good job.
-  Baking can be
a little messy sometimes.
That's okay, though.
Good job, mix it up, Finn!
- What is this?
-  These are the
heart cookie cutters,
'cause we're gonna cut
these into little hearts.
- Wait, I wanna see.
-  See, they're hearts.
- Oh.
-  Isn't that cool?
- Sugar or flour?
-  This is flour,
and we're gonna put it
all over the table, ready?
- No!
- (laughs) I won't get you, buddy.
Move your foot, move your foot.
-  Finn.
-  No foot, okay that's--
-  Yeah, Finn uses all
limbs when making cookies.
-  So then we take our hand,
and just kind of spread it around.
- This is their favorite part.
Kids love making messes.
What's on your hand? (laughs)
- Ready?
-  There you go.
-  Good job.
-  Oh! (laughs)
Boys, lookit, Momma's
hearts are shakin'. (laughs)
When she rolls the dough.
-  You look cute, Momma.
-  (chuckles) Thanks.
-  Finn, what is your car doin'?
(Finn vocalizes)
All right, boys, now we
gotta put our hearts,
and we gotta cut our cookies out, okay?
- Okay.
- So I'm gonna do this one, and Ollie,
I want you to do this one, and
Finn you do this one, okay?
So find anywhere on here that
you think it should go, okay?
-  That looks
awesome, so push it down.
-  Good job, push
it all the way down.
There it goes.
-  This is gonna be so good, guys.
-  Good job, Finn!
-  All right, push
that one down, Ollie.
Good job.
-  Good job.
-  One right there.
The next step requires
a mother's gentle touch.
(Missy laughs)
Basically, getting the
cookies out of the dough
without destroying them.
- Yeah, we don't have
to put it in the fridge,
so it's very (chuckles) gooey.
(upbeat music)
-  All right, the
boys are in their pajamas,
and it's now time to decorate the cookies.
And Missy went a little
crazy and bought everything.
(laughs)
We have everything to decorate
Valentine's Day cookies, huh?
- Yeah!
-  Ooh, so these are
cinnamon flavored hearts.
Show us what else we got, Ollie.
We've got more sprinkles. What else?
- White sprinkles.
-  Cool.
- They look like snow.
-  Pink.
Whoa, look over here, Ollie, we got candy.
We have Sweethearts and
Reese's, we've got some tips
for frostings, we also
have Skittles. (Finn yells)
What? (Finn yells)
Yeah.
-  Candy!
-  Yeah!
-  Whoa, what's that, Ollie?
- Cake icing.
-  Cool. Do you know how
you're gonna decorate yours?
- No.
-  No?
Do you know how you're
gonna decorate yours?
- Yeah.
-  You do?
-  (chuckles) Yeah.
-  Yeah.
- Maybe we should have a competition
and we all should design
a Valentine's Day cookie,
and then you guys decide
which one is better.
'Kay, Ollie, they're gonna
decide the winner, sound good?
-  Yeah.
-  All right.
We've got cookies and we've got
two boys who want to decorate.
You guys look so cute in your little
Valentine's Day hats. (laughs)
All right, Finn's gonna put
his icing, he's chose red.
And there he's off, ladies
and gentlemen! (laughs)
Kind of being a helicopter
parent, it's okay,
he's doing great, he's doing great.
-  Good job.
-  Is that so cool, Finn?
-  Okay, now it's my turn.
-  Do you want more?
-  That looks like buttercup.
-  All right, go ahead and use it.
Do you want me to spread it around?
-  Yeah.
-  Okay.
-  All right, Ollie's
off, too, he chose red.
(chuckles)
I think I'm actually going to
make a rainbow heart cookie
with some Skittles and the white icing.
Whoa, good job, I think
that's enough, Finn!
You got some cinnamon hearts on there?
- Yeah.
-  Well, good job, Finn,
going for the Sweethearts now?
- Yeah.
-  Go for it, Finn! Woo!
Um, that's a lot of
sprinkles, Ollie. (laughs)
That's so pretty, though!
That's awesome, dude.
(relaxed pop music)
- Whoa!
-  That's enough, that's enough.
-  Thank you.
-  You're welcome,
here, put some of those on.
-  'Kay.
-  Dang, babe.
Leave some Valentine's creativity
for the rest of us, okay?
(Missy laughs)
Finn's basically got it down, he's like,
"Oh, I totally get it, you just do icing
"and sprinkles, that's so easy."
We just decorated a ton of
cookies, check these all out.
I think these look so good.
All of us have chosen the
favorites that we've done tonight,
and we're gonna show them to you now,
so get ready to leave a comment down below
which one is your favorite.
Who is the winner, basically.
Is it me, Missy, Ollie, or Finn?
I'm gonna show you the cookies right now.
Taste The Rainbow, by Bryan.
This sprinkle-covered one is mine.
Ooh, and look at this one of Missy's,
it's so fluffy.
- It's called All You Need Is Love.
-  All You Need
Is Love is this one.
Look at the sprinkles
in there, I like that.
Ollie, is this one yours?
-  Yeah.
-  And which one
is it, what is it called?
- I call it The Fire One.
-  The Fire One.
This one is Finn's!
It's got a collection of
Sweethearts, sprinkles, icing,
Skittles, kind of the
whole shebang right there.
So there you go, you guys have to choose.
Which one? Let us know
down below in the comments
which one is your favorite.
Hey Finn, you got a cookie
under all these Skittles?
(laughs)
You got a cookie hiding
in all those Skittles,
did you know that?
- Yeah.
-  (laughs) You wanna try it?
-  Yeah.
-  Take a bite, ahmm.
How is it?
(Finn vocalizes)
Yeah, they're not too good once you get
all the stuff on them. (laughs)
(relaxed pop music)
- All right, this one's
called Heart Of Gold.
-  Ooh, went a little crazy
on that gold glitter, didn't we?
(both laugh)
How's that cookie, bro?
- Here, I like to eat it!
- Well I think that's
all for today's video.
We made enough mess for the day.
By the way, babe, these
sugar cookies are amazing.
-  Yay, it's so easy.
- She makes the best sugar
cookies from scratch,
you guys, honestly.
She slaves forever.
It took her years to come up
with the recipe, right, Finn?
- Mm-hmm.
- I had a grandma, a great great grandma,
and her name was Bettay Crooka.
- (laughs) Only the
millennials watching this
know what just happened.
But anyway, I hope you
guys enjoyed today's video.
If you did, be sure to give it
a thumb's up, thumb's up, boys!
-  Thumb's up!
- Thumb's up!
Thanks for watching, we'll see you manana.
Who wants to do the bye boop?
- Me!
-  All right.
-  Bye!
-  Boop.
