oh come on come here hang out in there
not our yard yeah karma come get my kid
he's gonna be soaking wet come and get
your ball get your ball boy oh my god
he's soaked he has no manners
what up guys I am headed to go get my
hair cut because it is long overdue
rocking the baseball cap this morning
because of it
um he's seriously so flippin nice out
here I know I say this all the time but
like man we are so blessed to live in
Southern California like it is sunny and
the skies are blue and I can't wait to
go to the beach like and see the water
and actually Missy and I are going to
the beach on Monday because she has the
day off and I have the day off and we
haven't been in a while so we're gonna
check out the beach on Monday so that
should be really really fun I worked so
long yesterday it was Valentine's Day
and as a server it is insanely busy and
not only is it insanely busy but one of
our rival steak houses that are in the
area their kitchen caught on fire so
they weren't even in service after like
noon so we got packed it was insane and
you get home to like 11:00 11:30 or
something like that so man it was not a
fun night but I will tell you I slept so
good um but that's it was funny Missy's
little surprise that she got me her her
cheesy Valentine's Day set up I think
she proved her point you know that
chocolates and flowers and cards and and
balloons they're just cheesy and I kind
of understand where she's coming from
but yeah she's cute um she's I think she
was worried that people thought she
hated Valentine's Day and she didn't she
just sort of hates the commercialism of
it all and and we're always really good
at at making each other feel special and
and surprising each other on a daily
basis so that's how it should be I think
hey guys so I just got back from the
haircut how's it look it's a lot better
to deal with so love getting my hair cut
and I don't do it enough I always go
like two or three months without getting
a cut so I think this time it just went
a little over a month and it's like nice
because it was just starting to get to
the point where it was like annoying to
deal with so they look pretty swaggy
swag swag on you chillin by the fire
while we eatin fondue um but it's a
beautiful day out and I just found a 25
dollar Panera card so I think I'm gonna
go in some lunch and then Karma's sad so
II sad boy oh hi grandma he's been
locked up inside all day so he really
wants to go outside and Missy's almost
off work so I think I'll wait for her
we're gonna take you to the park did you
want to go to the park I knew Missy
would kill me if I went to Panera and
didn't get her anything so I got her a
bag a troll oh and also to get a butter
crap okay I got the butter that would
have been really bad I had to like clean
out she's like give me lots of the
butter because I really liked it so I
actually grabbed the rest that was at
the bottom of the dish so um I pray that
it's enough butter I'm still obsessed
with this justin timberlake song mirrors
have you guys heard it
marry me no please I didn't go it's so
good oh you've gotta be strong I don't
know hey guys so we are at Petsmart
darris Carla and we're gonna get him a
new thrower I lost it from like a few
months ago when we were at the dog park
I left it at the park and someone stole
it from me so I haven't really purchased
a new one so we are looking at these
types of throwers so remember that yeah
so and maybe a new collar because he
really he's obviously not a very good
dog on the leash
a big one really yeah cuz he listens my
day one or is any men guarding it
already gets tired there's this medium
one for 11900 wait
same price really huh okay yeah maybe
like that some kind of call Oh sort
because he's parable in the lease maybe
something to help him walk better so

of day it is no matter where I am no
matter if I'm on my way to work and I'm
