ah get your belly button I'm gonna eat
it ah daddy's still young
it's so good
that's beautiful very talented Oliver
yes you are good morning good morning
this morning I was playing around with
Ollie and the Glalie and now I'm just
trying to get some last-minute work done
before I leave forever
I'm never coming back just kidding I'm
coming back I might actually have a
really cool DVD of us on the Hollywood
Rip Ride Rockit when we were in Florida
and it's a right video DVD and so I like
had a camera in front of it and I'm
trying to get it to rip on my computer
and the program I'm using keeps crashing
so I'm trying to find a different one so
that I can actually take the movie off
the DVD and edit it and put it on my
channel it's all okay so I'm basically
about to abandon that and find food
because I have not eaten today
morning guys I'm just sitting here
actually currently getting ready as you
see one eyes dead when I was not done
Oliver has been laying in bed for about
an hour now and he's still not asleep
there he is
as you can see he's just standing up
singing Oliver James you're supposed to
be asleep he's like ah I don't want to
mom us apparently yesterday because I
gave him such a late nap he thinks that
every day he's gonna get a late nap and
so he got his normal nap on schedule
today but he's like um
I don't want to go to sleep so I'm gonna
finish my makeup and then I'm basically
just gonna go get him I've never been
overseas it's kind of a big deal for me
and I am going to miss the food here in
America I'm definitely going to miss
Jersey Mike's our favorite sandwich shop
so I decided today I'm gonna drive down
there and pick us up some sandwiches and
savor it and if some of you are curious
as to why I'm going to Cambodia because
we've actually been getting a lot of new
subscribers and so I know a lot of you
are probably like why is he going to
Cambodia we actually did a fund raising
a fund raising campaign in December and
we raised over like twenty three
thousand dollars for an organization in
Cambodia so I'm going to be going to
Cambodia to meet up with that
organization and talk with them I'm
going to be shooting some video for a
local church and getting some really
nice video for that I'm going to
basically just be exploring Cambodia and
seeing where you know all this money
that you guys helped us raise went and
how it's going to help these people I
really think it's gonna change my life
and sort of how I see the world honestly
you didn't even close your eyes for a
second what's up with that oh your doggy
here to see you come over why didn't you
take a nap
are you tired boy you want to play a
little bit and then we'll go and take a
nap oh yeah we will go play and then we
can take a nap but you have tomorrow you
have to take your nap on time okay all
right
you want to read some books all right
we'll we'll read books and play and then
you take a nap okay I'm going to eat
your other air and now I'm going to eat
your eyeball you're trapped forever yes
you are oh good eat your bellybutton I'm
gonna eat it ah daddy's silly on so
because Oliver missed his first nap now
he's extremely tight ideas he's like
hang his head like I did it guys you're
like the second hole in the heart I know
he fell asleep right away
but we are officially in Cambodia mode
gotta grab something explore Cambodia
because obviously he's going to be
taking an 18-hour flight and I just
think it's going to be really smart for
him to have lots of snacks and foods and
things like you can eat okay so model
water okay Kate okay my aunt says that
there's plenty of clean drinking water
and then it won't be pulled by the Sun
yeah but I just thought personally I
would prefer bottled water with me knock
keys but like like one for each day just
I think you'll be fine Jesus for know I
do think he needs um lots of snacks and
like protein bars and just lots of yummy
bars for him to eat in case he's just
like out and about and he needs a quick
snack so that's we're on we were
basically off to get all the extra items
that he needs I think somebody's came
really really good underwear it's hot
just very hot you guys I know someone
was saying it's like I'm sure it's not
too bad other than like Florida I don't
know about anything like Florida I think
it is way way different it should be a
very interesting experience and this guy
likes to sweat sweat huh I dunno he
doesn't like this wet but he does but I
promised Ollie we would get him a new
ball so since I left his other one at
Emily's so we've got a small ball here
so you can throw it around and this one
so you can kick it around you know in
England they call these footballs
these aren't footballs these are soccer
balls what's this Holly what is any oh
good job see they don't have much of a
selection so that's why I chose the
soccer ball well going off this sucker
huh I was just saying how it's a soccer
ball but in England they call it a
football this is a football but this is
actually a football no this is what they
call this soccer ball no they don't
nope nope
what anything are you so excited it's
technology yeah go run man run this kid
is like running throughout this entire
store I just figured I'm just going to
chase him instead of try and catch him
I like you
Ollie come on come on
just got back from getting supplies for
Cambodia and I want to show you guys a
little bit about what I am bringing so I
got some snack stuff these are
nutrigrain bars this is for like
breakfast if we're in a hurry and I
don't really have time to eat breakfast
so I got those I got fruit snacks I'm
gonna be bringing a couple of vitamin
waters just to have because I like
vitamin water
I got Kleenex I got zzzquil because I'm
gonna try and sleep on the plane so I
can get into actual Cambodia time I got
Cottonelle fresh wipes cuz you know you
got a stage so fresh so clean and this
is really important
I got Gold Bond medicated body powder
because I am so afraid of being sweaty
and it's just it's like 100 percent
humidity there and so I know I'm going
to be sweaty and I just want to be
comfortable so I got that I got some
shampoo and conditioner toothpaste so
I'm also I got some of these champion
boxer briefs and these are like the best
kind I research this to make sure I'll
find a good kind but these are the power
cool and it basically is like really
good if you're doing lots of walking or
like exerciser stuff you don't want
there to be a lot of moisture on your
body just because it's painful sometimes
so just try and get everything set up
and ready
downloading like a ton of movies on the
iPad so that I can watch movies on the
plane and I'm honestly thinking that I
may sleep and try and catch up on
Cambodia time and then a but I'll still
have if I sleep for five hours I'm still
gonna have like 12 hours actually 13
hours so I can fit in a bunch of movies
I got like all the Harry Potter's and
all of the Hunger Games cuz Oh Missy the
new Hunger Games movie came out on DVD
