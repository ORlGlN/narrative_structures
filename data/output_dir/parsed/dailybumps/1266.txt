ladies and gentlemen is how you scared
kids do amazing things come in do you
want to try that blow dryer car well you
keep slapping me in the face
real men blow dry their hair
oh yeah this is what it's come to you
guys we now have to have the trash can
on the table at night because karma is
just not to be trusted anymore we came
home the other day there's trash all
over the floor including papers and like
that is so not cool we need something to
keep all the out of the trash I mean
something to keep karma out of the trash
if you guys have any suggestions for
products leave some links below in the
comments because we need them and I'm
not sure what's good or what yeah yeah
he's been so talkative I just know that
if we had or knew another baby who was
like being talkative like him he could
just sit down with them and just talk
forever it's the cutest thing when you
can get two babies next to each other
but hello guys I am up and ready just
about done doing my hair and makeup
although I really socked on my hair
today it's really just like poofy blah
but I really don't feel like doing
anything more with it like curling it or
anything which by the way I really need
to make a video on curling my hair with
this thing because everyone asks about
it all the time like how do you get here
here and I've even told people I'm gonna
do a review and I just keep putting it
off because I just I have so many videos
that I have to do that I'm just doing
like what I have to do instead of what I
want to do which is like a hair tutorial
like this or fun videos which is kind of
bumming me out you know like I love my
channel and it's growing like crazy
right now too but I just haven't had the
time to really dedicate to it I've been
just doing so many other videos and
especially with baby League and stuff
like that that I just feel like my
channel is kind of just I've just been
doing it but I haven't really been doing
anything cool with it lately I don't
know that's just my opinion I still put
out videos and I loved it and hopefully
soon I'll be able to actually do more
like a little bit better videos but I
love did you like dane life videos or
like a little bit more in depth videos
but i just haven't been able to but i'm
ready and actually i'm filling a couple
videos today actually there's gonna be
one up right now even though i haven't
filmed it yet but there's one on my
channel right now so go check it out if

in my tub I actually forgot about this
thing this is something that someone
made for us a long time ago from Sabrina
mother to three girls that's actually
her youtube name she actually made us
this really really cool photo album
that's like a scrapbook but she did all
the work except didn't put the pictures
in you could basically just grow with
him and got spots for all his pictures
or it's like all pre-done very
creatively done watch out monkey oh yeah
that's what monkeys do look at this is a
onesie definitely now that he's a year
old I could definitely like print out
some cool pictures and put in here so
I'm gonna have to do that because this
is really really cool and I've been kind
of saving in hoping that one day I'll be
able to stick some pictures in it I can
do it he's like can I do me mom yeah

Oliver right in the front look what we

were in there Brian gave me his
sunglasses and then I need to drink then
he needs to drink and I was like oh we
