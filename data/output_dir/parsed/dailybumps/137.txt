-  Going for a ride.
Hey Finn say good morning.
Good morning.

-  Good morning.

Hashtag Dad life.
Just walking around with a
couple of crazy kids on my feet.

-  Hey, is that that scary snake
that scared me yesterday?
- Yeah.
- That was pretty funny, huh?
If you guys didn't see Missy scare me with
the snake prank yesterday
you need to watch it.
I'll have the video in
the iCard above so you can
check it out, it was quite funny.
- Whoa, dude, you got a
swingin' snake there, bro.
What do you have, Finn?
Oh, what are you trying to do? (laughs)
- He has a stamp.
- You have the stamp?
Let me see it, I need to confiscate it.
Sir.
Excuse me, excuse me, sir.
(Finley laughs)
Excuse me, sir, excuse
me, sir (Bryan laughs)
(Finley yells)
- Let me see this, ooh a stamp.
We took these stamps
away from their little
gift bags from the
birthday parties yesterday
because they get
everywhere, I'm not kidding.
Like one time this little kid got a hold
of a stamp and you
stamped everything, huh.
He's like yep and I'm proud of it.
- Hi Dad.
-  What Finn?
(Finley mutters)
-  You want what?
(Finley mutters)
-  You want to open the fridge?
- Yep.
-  Okay, what do you want in there?
- No.
(Oliver yells)
-  Oh, you want the freezer?
(Finley yells)
-  They're
raiding the fridge, babe.
- They want ice cream.
-  All the time, always.
(parents laugh)
-  You guys are raiding the fridge
and you're not even teenagers, yet.
- No.
-  Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.
Finley Jay, what are you doing?
- I want ice cream.
-  You want ice cream?
- Yeah.
- How about later after lunch, okay?
Let's see how they react
to closing the freezer.
Let's have ice cream after lunch, okay?
- Okay.
- Oh, you're so polite.
What a good little boy.
We must have raised this one right.
- Yeah, or he knows he's on camera.
(laughter)
(upbeat music)
- So we went to the store
yesterday and bought
a ton of Halloween
candy 'cuz I love having
Halloween candy out so
you can grab a piece
and enjoy it and now the kids have learned
how to steal all of the candy, right?
- Anything?
- You can have some candy corn.
I'm actually surprised that
he even likes candy corn
because not a lot of
people likes candy corn.
I personally love candy
corn, I think it's like
a really simple treat
but yes a lot of people
are anti-candy corn, so let me know in
the comments down below,
are you pro-candy corn
or are you against candy corn?
I think it's perfect
Fall candy, don't you?
- Mmm hmm.
-  Yeah, cheers.
(chuckles)
Don't steal it.
You stole it.
Face of guilt right there.
What did you do, you conned
Mama into some chocolate?
- Mmm hmm.
- These two kids are a
bunch of baby thieves.
That's what you are,
huh, baby candy thieves.
Speaking of candy thief,
you guys, look what I
just found in Ollie's room.
- Haha, I'm going to steal all the candy.
(slow, mischievous music)
(cackling)
- Hm, where's all the candy?
(footfalls clink)
A ha ha.
Hm, what's this?
Oh, candy.
(cackles)
Oh yeah I got the candy.
I never know where they hid it.
(cackles)
-  Oh, no candy
thief, there's a cop.
He's gonna get you.
(Oliver yells)
Get him, cuff him.
Finn, you make a cute police officer.
(sirens wail)
I can't believe I'm
catching this on camera.
You guys, I'm vlogging a
police pursuit right now.
We've got a thief in our
house trying to steal
all our Halloween candy.
It's not even Halloween.
- No, you won't get me.
- Get him, Finn, get him.
(sirens)
Oh man, he is way too fast, huh?
Did you eat too many
donuts today, officer Finn?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, officer Finn ate
too many donuts today.
I'll help you get him, okay?
-  I got you candy thief
with my special agent mom.
No more stealing our Halloween candy.
- Oh, yeah?
- You're under arrest.
- Oh yeah?
- Let's see who this candy bandit is.
(yells)
-  Oh no, he escaped the cuffs
before we could reveal his true identity.
Officer Finn, can you help us?
-  Go get him.
(sirens wail)
-  Special agent
mom has got you now.
- All right we need to
reveal, we need to reveal.
-  Who's the true
identity of this masked villain?
(all gasp)
- Ollie?
- Ollie?
You stole all our Halloween candy?
- Yes.
-  But why, why would you do it?
- Because.
-  Because why?
- Because.
(majestic music)
-  Good job, boys.
Was that fun dressing up
and you trying to steal
all our candy?
We've gotta put all this candy back.
This has got to last us all month, okay?
- Wait, I have more candy.
-  You have more?
-  You're right, the bandits candy.
- More candy.
Wow, Ollie, you stole lots of candy.
All right boys, you can
have one piece of candy.
Finn, you got a Reese's?
Yummy.
Ollie, what candy do you want to choose?
You can have a candy if you'd like.
Sour Patch Kids?
I'm going to steal a Kit Kat.
(laughs maniacally)
They may think they know
where our candy stash is but they don't.
There's one that I didn't show him.
(electronic music)
-  Finn, you make quite a cute
police officer, you know that?
- Yep.
- Yeah, he knows that. (laughs)
So we woke up this morning and Pearl,
this clownfish here ended up
eating the other clownfish.
- I'm really upset about it.
-  She ate both
our beautiful clownfish
and she's obviously very aggressive
so we're going to take her
back to the fish place today.
So we're going to scoop her out.
Let's see if we can do this, babe.
I believe in you.
- She knows.
-  She knows.
- Look at her hide underneath there.
Come here.
-  That's right, come over here.
All right let's put some bait in. (laughs)
-  It's like
we're actually fishing.
-  There she goes, there she goes.
- Shh.
- Oh.
- She's a little stinker, she knows.
-  She's smart, she knows. (laughs)
(child yells)
-  Come on evil little fish.
Oh, hiding back in her hole.
- All right so scooping
her out with the scooper
is just not working so
Bryan just so happened
to have a fish trap that
he must've purchased
off Amazon just in case
something like this
happened and so I just
put it all together.
It's like a big box and
there's food inside the box
and there's this piece
of glass that's the door.
What is it, Ollie?
- It's a trap.
- It's a trap door and then as soon as
she swims in there we
pull the string I've got
here and it pulls that little piece that's
there up and then the door will shut.
I'm just trying to stand back as far away
as possible so I can be
with my little string
and I'm waiting for her to swim in, huh?
- Yes.
(laughs)
-  She's over on
the left and I'm waiting
for her to swim over to the right.
Looks like she's getting a little braver.
-  Quick stop at the fish store.
We went and talked to the
guy who's been helping
us get all set up.
He said that if that
one is being aggressive
that is definitely a
fluke thing and if we want
to get any more of the
nice orange clownfish
we're going to have to get her out.
We tried to get her out.
- We definitely want more clownfish, so-
-  Yeah.
- We'll have to get her
out sooner or later.
- So we're going to try it,
we have an appointment for
next week for them to come
by, too because they're really good at it.
So we have a couple days
to try and get her out.
He did say that we could go ahead
and get started on some other things
so we got more crabs
for cleanup since Pearl
had her little rampage.
We got another cleaner shrimp,
which these are going to clean the tank.
We got a couple of corals
to put into the rock
to start growing and then we got a big guy
our first tang who actually eats seaweed
so that's going to be really cool.
- Sounds really fun.
- Yeah, he's one of the
biggest fish we've bought
so far so it'll be nice.
We can buy them small
and watch them get big
or we can get them big
and put them in our tank
because he says we have a good tank.
- He's still small, he's
going to get way big.
- Oh, yeah he said he's still
probably less than a year.
(mellow music)
-  Ollie, what are you doing?
- I found a chicken egg.
-  He found a chicken
egg out in the chicken coop
and he came to his playroom
and now he's putting it
in blankets in his
playroom so it stays warm.
Why are you doing that?
- Because I don't want
it to be cold or hot.
- Oh, okay well this isn't going to turn
into a chicken, buddy,
this is actually just
an egg that we can eat.
Isn't that cool?
- Mmm hmm.
-  Yeah, can
you go give it to Mama?
- Here you go, Mama.
-  Do you need an
egg for tonight's dinner?
- Nope.
-  Nope, good job, buddy.
- Can we move my calendar?
-  Oh yeah, you can.
- Yeah, we forgot about that.
-  Do you want to grab
the seven out for yesterday?
- Yeah.
- All right you can grab the seven.
No that's a nine.
There you go that's a seven.
Nice, can you share
that with your brother?
- Yeah.
-  He's got some
candy for you, Finn.
- I took it out from the calendar.
- Finn really wants to get the eight.
Okay, so it's October
eighth so you can pull
the candy, no, no, no, no, the other one.
There you go, yay.
- So the boys are playing
outside and getting
some last minute wiggles out
because it's almost time for dinner
But I am cooking up a few things.
I've got my chicken pot pie all prepared
for tonight, I'm just
going to pop it in the oven
it's all ready to go, it'll just take like
30-40 minutes to cook.
Then I've got a pumpkin pie here
that I am cooking up right now.
And I did something a little differently.
Instead of just mixing all
the pumpkin pie mixture
all together and just throwing
it into a pie and cooking it.
I read a little tip that
said if you're using
canned pumpkin, to heat
it up on the stove first
with a little bit of spices and it gets
the canned flavor out and makes it
taste more like fresh pumpkin.
So I just basically heated
it all up and I'm waiting
for it to cool before
I mix in all the milk
and eggs and all of that.
So I'm excited to make
pumpkin pie and then
I was even thinking I know
this seems a little crazy
because I'm like, I am
not even probably eating
the pumpkin pie or this but I thought
I'd make some cookies, too.
Ollie's been begging
to help me make cookies
and so I thought maybe I'll do it
and I was just sitting here cooking.
The house is clean, the
kitchen is pretty clean.
I'm waiting for that to
cool so maybe I'll just
throw together some cookies, too.
- Can you crumple that into a ball?
(laughs)
All right, sit next to Ollie.
Crumple that into a ball.
Let me see it Ollie.
Thanks, buddy.
- Wow, good job.
- I will take your crumpled ball
and I'm going to put it
right here on the bottom.
Thank you, Finn, good job.
I'm showing the boys how to start a fire.
(laughs)
- I'm having some Boy Scouts flashbacks.
Actually, you know I had to do this
every single morning
when I was in Boy Scouts?
-  Oh yeah, yep.
- That was how we kept warm.
- Yeah, I remember that
little fire in the house.
Oh my goodness, look boys.
(boys gasp)
Isn't that cool?
Look, he's going to lite
your piece of paper on fire.
Remember where it is?
- Mmm hmm.
-  Finn's like, I'm
going to blow that out.
- ♫ Happy Birthday to you.
-  I hope this works
I've never made a fire in this one.
-  Well, you've got your kindle
and your big pieces of log.
-  Should work, right?
-  Yeah, in theory it should work.
There it goes.
- I just felt like it
was one of those nights.
-  It's cold.
- It's cold.
I just want to bundle in a blanket
and stand by the fire
and roast marshmallows.
Does that sound like a good idea?
-  Yeah, I've got
pumpkin pie, cookies and-
- Pumpkin pie, cookies and?
- I've got pumpkin pie, I've got cookies
and I've got chicken pot pie.
- Yum, that's going to be good.
-  So, all the
Fall things. (chuckles)
It actually has been really warm the past
couple of days and even
last night was a warm
night because normally we cool down a lot
at night, but it was a warm night.
(slow guitar music)
-  Missy put both
of these pies in the oven
and then she put the kids to
bed so I just took them out.
We've got a chicken pot
pie and a pumpkin pie
and I am so excited for
dinner and dessert tonight.
Also, I smell like smoke because I've been
hanging out outside by
the fire with the boys.
It's just been a really fun, cool night.
Speaking of, I just walked
out here and Ollie is watching
the iPad underneath the
blanket by the fire.
Are you having fun in there, dude?
Yeah?
Hey Ollie, do you want to
end the vlog like that?
-  Yeah, thank you
for watching this video.
(Bryan laughs)
-  Bye.
Boop.
(happy instrumental music)
