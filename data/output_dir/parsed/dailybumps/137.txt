- Hey guys, welcome to today's vlog,
but before it begins I have to
a quick announcement to make.
Yesterday we put up two videos
on the Daily Bumps channel.
One was the vlog and then
one was the kid's reacting
to the I Ate All Your
Halloween Candy prank.
I'm gonna have the prank
linked up above in the icard
so that you can check that video out.
We filmed that today, but I
wanted to give it to you guys
as early as possible
because it was pretty funny.
Finn was quite vocal.
So go check that out.
Now on to today's vlog.
♫ This is our life
♫ This is our fun
♫ This is who we are
♫ This is our dream
♫ This is our team
♫ Shot among the stars
♫ Take this shield and you'll be fine
♫ Take this hand and watch us shine
♫ This is our life
♫ Let's live it
♫ Live it forever
Good morning, Finn.
How ya doing this morning?
Yeah, you're eating breakfast.
Ollie's clinging on to Halloween still.
(laughs)
Did you have a good Halloween, Ollie?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
The boys woke up in a very happy mood
so I think we're gonna
go somewhere fun today.
You ready?
- Woohoo!
(Finn babbling)
-  You eating?
-  Woohoo!
-  Look at those little waffles.
Those are just your size, huh?
- Look where we're at!
Where we at?
- Disneyland.
- We made it to Disneyland!
Are you so excited?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- A bubble maker.
- Oh, look at that.
It's a fountain.
It's kind of a weird time
'cause Halloween's over
but the holiday stuff hasn't happened yet,
but they're starting to let out
a lot of the Christmas stuff
and it's so exciting.
I can't wait for it to be
Christmas time at Disneyland.
We're meeting Kelsey and Corbin here.
And we're gonna have a lot of fun today
because Ollie gets to ride
a lot of the big kid rides,
and he's so excited.
Which big kid ride are
you excited to ride?
- Star Wars?
- Star Wars!
- Stars Wars, he's super
excited about that one.
- They have guns.
- They do, do they have guns?
There is a lot of shooting
going on in the Star Wars one.
(cheerful music)
- There's Disneyland!
- Yeah, we got a very
special princess joining us.
Princess June, hi baby.
All right, you guys.
Ollie is about to ride
a big kid ride with me.
What ride are we gonna ride, dude?
- Star Wars!
- Star Wars!
We're riding the Star
Tours ride with my boy.
This is actually happening.
He's big enough, this is so cool.
He's so excited.
You so excited?
- Yeah.
- Are you gonna be scared though?
- You don't need to be scared.
- 'Cause Darth Vader.
Darth Vader will be there.
- Darth Vader will be there,
but he won't get to you, okay?
- Okay.
- As long as you're sitting
next to me, you'll be fine.
Headed in to Tomorrowland.
Honestly, these are
scarier than Star Tours.
- Yeah, this is really scary.
-  They should not be up anymore.
(laughs) The seatbelt
functionality is lacking.
(cheerful music)
- That's Star Tours!
-  Yes, we are.
Let's do this!
And look it, Ollie, there's
some Stormtroopers coming.
- Yeah, I see.
So Ollie, we are about
to board a spaceship.
This is where we board.
Isn't that cool?
- Yeah!
-  Ollie, who's up there?
- R2D2 and a gun.
-  Whoa!
- There's C-3PO.
- Yeah!
(energetic music)
- We're getting ready
to board our spaceship.
But we have our special flight googles on.
Show 'em.
We have to wear these in
order to be on the spaceship?
- Yeah.
- Oh okay.
He's so excited.
He almost didn't get on.
They had to measure him again,
but he's tall enough now.
Probably almost tall
enough for Space Mountain.
Or he can do Space Mountain, huh?
-  Yeah.
- Crazy, he can Space Mountain.
He can do Thunder Mountain Railroad.
- It's closed today.
That's the only that's closed.
-  Oh, Space
Mountain's closed today?
- Yeah, but we can save that one.
-  Yeah, he's
too excited right now.
(energetic music)
-  What do you
think of this, Ollie?
You got your seatbelt on?
Buckle it in.
- Good job, dude.
- Ollie, are you getting nervous?
He's excited.
- We just off the Star Tours
ride and it was so fun.
It was actually the one where
we go into the Death Star.
Hey Ollie, you have to tell me.
What did think of the Star Tours ride?
- It was good!
-  What was your favorite part?
- The guns.
-  The guns?
- Yeah.
- Were you scared when
you saw Darth Vader?
- No.
- No, you knew you were safe.
They have now just put us
into a Star Wars mecca of shopping.
That's what Disney does,
puts you in the gift shop.
Now he's like I want something.
Ollie, you know we get to go
to see the new Star Wars movie.
It's coming out soon.
- Yeah, I know.
(upbeat music)
- So we are hanging out
in New Orleans Square
while Kelsey and Corbin ride Indiana Jones
so we're watching baby June,
but we were just sitting here in the shade
and seeing the small amount
of Christmas decorations
start trickling in.
- Yeah, slowly coming out.
- Kind of like at our house I feel like.
- Yeah.
- Once November 1st rolls around.
You see 'em?
Yeah, look, they have these
Santas hanging in the tree
and then they even have a
little bit of the garland
on the windows and stuff.
Oh, and over there too.
They're getting ready.
- The castle's already covered in snow.
And that's just like the holiday thing.
- Yeah.
- That's pretty cool.
- It's really cool how Disneyland
always changes and adapts
to the seasons and stuff.
Excited to see some new things
for Christmas here at Disneyland.
- Do they keep Nightmare
Before Christmas the same
because it's Christmasy?
- I think so.
I think so, yeah.
I'm not really sure.
Oh, maybe Jack wears a Santa outfit.
- Yeah.
- That would be cool.
- We've been here for like five years now.
We still don't know.
- We still don't know it all.
We're always learning all the new secrets.
Ollie, what'd you get?
Beads?
- Yeah.
-  Whoa, they both got
beads and they're so excited.
We were listening to the
live music band in here
and they threw them at the boys
'cause they were having so much fun.
Getting a little taste of Mardi Gras here.
Finn, did you show June?
You like those, you like the beads?
(laughs)
This is so funny.
(upbeat jazz music)
All right Ollie, what
big boy ride is next?
Big.
- Big.
-  Thunder.
- Thunder.
-  Mountain.
- Mountain.
- Railroad.
- Railroad!
-  Yeah!
This is another ride that he's never done
and he's tall enough for.
- One of my favorites when I was a kid.
- I know, all right,
check your height, dude.
Stand right there on the horseshoes, see?
See, you're tall enough.
Let's go.
(upbeat music)
- He's always climbing.
-  Always climbing.
-  Ollie, we're about to go
on a big kid rollercoaster ride.
What do you think?
- Good.
-  Are you so excited?
- Yeah.
-  Yay, you're tall enough.
We're gonna go on Thunder Mountain.
-  Howdy
partners, for your safety.
- Oh yeah, here we go.
Ready?
- Yeah.
- All right.
(screaming)
-  Are you having fun?
- That was so fast.
-  We're gonna go again.
- You ready?
(screaming)
(screaming)
Whoa!
(upbeat music)
Wow Ollie, that was crazy.
- Yeah.
- Did you see the dinosaur?
- Yeah.
- Then the explosion?
- Yeah.
- Was that cool?
- Yeah.
- You're not afraid?
No?
You're a big boy, that's why, huh?
Always trying new foods at Disneyland.
Look at this breadstick, Ollie.
It's called a Tiger Tail.
(laughs)
He's not so sure about that breadstick.
Got some skewers there,
that's chicken and beef.
It looks so good.
-  You wanna try this?
What is it?
- I'm gonna try this.
This is Jungle Julep.
It's just like a slushie.
It kind of taste like...
- Just like a big slushie.
-  Yeah, you know those
slushies we like to drink?
- Or Icee.
- Why you being so weird?
It's Icee, Ollie.
- That looks like a scorpion.
- No, it doesn't.
He's so funny.
(Finn babbling)
Yeah, you wanna try some?
Finn seriously just grabbed
the camera out of the bottom
of the stroller and then it turned it on
and gave it to me because
he wanted me to vlog him.
All right, what do you wanna show 'em?
-  We are at Disneyland.
-  He's being so silly.
You wanna go do a little dance with him?
(upbeat music)
- We're home!
- We're home.
And what you don't know is
that all day I have had someone
in here cleaning my carpets
because they were trashed.
I mean literally trashed.
And not just from the Halloween party.
It was already so disgusting
for just from having kids
and living in the country and having dogs.
And it was just so dirty
and check out my carpet now.
First of all, everything is cleaned out.
All my couches over here.
But yeah, this walkway was so bad.
There were just stains
all over the carpet.
And over here you can still
see a couple little stains.
To be honest, when Luna was in heat,
she kind of made a little
bit of a mess over here
so that look like 90%
better than what it did
so I'm actually really happy with that.
And that's usually where
her crates goes anyway
so I'm not too worried about it.
But yeah, anyways,
besides that little stain,
it looks so good.
Check out the kid's playroom.
Which wasn't bad either
because it had a big rug in it,
but there were a few
spots where the rug wasn't
that was really, really bad.
Honestly, just from
having a puppy and stuff.
It's just been like. (groans)
The carpet's been gross.
I'm actually very much
debating just getting rid
of all the carpet and just
doing tile throughout the house.
Or maybe not tile,
but some sort of wood
looking tile or hardwood.
I'm not really sure.
- Hey guys.
-  What's up?
- Look.
- Oh my goodness, he did magic.
You're magic.
We are home, the boys are exhausted.
So they're eating a little
bit of dinner on the counter.
If you're wondering why
he's on the counter.
It's because he's eating
dinner on the counter.
And then we are actually
gonna get them ready for bed.
And they're going to bed.
They had a long day, huh?
And Finn wants to ride his Spider-Man toy
which has been outside, on
my freshly clean carpets
which is not okay so
I'm gonna stop that now.
- All righty, Missy is getting
the boys ready for bed.
But what a fun day.
That was seriously such a good Disney day.
The weather was perfect,
the lines were not long.
We actually used the new
fastpass thing on your phone.
You pay $10 and then all day you're able
to deserve fastpasses on your phone
so that was super helpful too.
So if you're going to Disneyland, the $10
for the fastpass thing on your
phone is totally worth it.
That's all for today's video.
Hope you guys enjoyed it.
Remember, go check out
yesterday's bonus video
linked up above in the icard.
Subscribe to this channel and
leave me a comment down below
with what your favorite
Disneyland ride is.
Ollie says that Star Tours
is now his favorite ride
which I think is amazing.
But anyway, thanks for watching.
Give this video a thumbs up.
We'll see you manana, bye.
