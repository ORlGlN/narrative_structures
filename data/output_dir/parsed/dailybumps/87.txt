-  Good morning!
- Look how happy these
boys are this morning.
Did you have a good Thanksgiving?
- Yeah.
- And are you excited for today?
Yeah, it is a beautiful day here.
The day after Thanksgiving
and it is pretty warm out,
I'd say it's probably
in the 90s, maybe 80s.
But it's a warm day for sure.
So we are actually super excited
because we are headed somewhere so fun!
We do this every single year and it is
definitely a family
tradition and I just love it.
It's fun to kind of get
away with the family
and connect right as
Christmas season is starting.
I don't know.
It always just makes
it feel like Christmas
is coming cause we're
spending time with the family.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
But yeah, we have just been
like cleaning like crazy.
The house is a total disaster
after all of the Thanksgiving fun.
And we're packing.
We're packing, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we gotta get all
our fun stuff together,
games, snacks, warm clothes.
And we're headed up tot
he mountains, aren't we?
Yay!
- We are all packed up for our cabin trip.
I know it seems like we just
got back from a trip and here we go.
We're doing another one.
This is just how we do it, you guys.
This is a really big
family tradition of ours.
It's something we've been doing for,
what like, three or four years now?
Five, maybe actually,
about five years now.
And we go up to the cabin, and it's
always such a really fun time.
So I'm really excited.
We have the truck loaded up.
Ollie's in here cause he's
excited to go, aren't you?
- Yeah!
-  You think it'll snow?
- Yeah.
- No, it's not gonna snow (laughter).
We were really hoping it was gonna snow,
or be cold, and I really
don't think it is, so.
It's gonna be just a nice
mountain getaway, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Alright climb
in your seat, buddy.
- Okay.
-  Hey, do you know
how to buckle yourself in yet?
- No.
- No?
- Yeah, but I can buckle it without me in.
- Oh you can?
- Yeah.
-  Well that's pretty smart.
Hey, Finn, you ready to go?
- Yeah.
(laughter)
-  Alright, climb in Ollie.
I'll buckle you in.
- We're going to the cabin.
-  Yes, we are, and
look who's coming with us!
Hi Luna girl.
She's basically like
the best dog ever, so.
- She's so good.
-  Yeah, we were
like, we're definitely
taking her cause she loves Idyllwild.
Idyllwild is such like
a puppy town, you know.
- Yeah, yeah.
-  So, she's gonna fit right in.
- We love Karma-
- Yeah.
- We love Karma-
- Obviously.
And Karma is such a good
dog, but he is gonna
be a lot more comfortable at home.
-  Yes.
- Where he likes his area,
and his space, and his people.
- Yeah.
(laughter)
-  So he's gonna be
here, holding down the fort,
and Luna's gonna come and play with us.
You excited to go to the cabin Luna?
Let's go!
-  She looks so excited, too,
she's just like, let's do it!
- I hope Luna doesn't
escape from the cabin.
-  You know what, me too, honestly.
Me too, can you not
escape this time, please.
(deep bass music)
- We made it to the cabin!
-  Yeah, we have
made it, didn't we boys?
Remember these, Ollie?
Giant pine cones.
Isn't that scary looking?
- Look over here, guys, there's a house.
-  Oh, it's like
a little bird house, huh?
- Yeah, it's full of rocks.
-  It's styled after a wild
west saloon, that's pretty cool.
Welcome to our vacation cabin you guys.
We are gonna give you
a little bit of a tour.
We've been here before on the
Vlog, but for those of you
who haven't seen this,
you're in for a treat.
- Yeah.
- Cause this is really fun.
- We're really excited. Yay!
Anyone home?
-  Yeah.
-  Hello?
Welcome to our home.
Alright, Ollie, do you
wanna give a little tour?
Tell us where Finn's sleeping.
- Um, Finn's sleeping in here.
-  Yeah, his bed's
already set up in there, even.
-  We have Finn's room.
So we've got a bed in here with a table,
but we put Finn's bed in here.
- Yep, and Ollie stayed in
there last year, but this year
we're gonna do something
a little bit different.
Alright, what's in this room?
- It's a bathroom!
- Yep, bathroom!
- Yeah!
Alright, now the house,
this is the living room.
And they've actually
changed it up a little.
I feel like it's a little more open now.
(child screams)
(laughter)
So we've got the living room
and the TV, and we'll hook up
our Apple TV, so we can
play games and watch movies.
And then we've got our dining room table,
and our kitchen, which is so-
I love having a kitchen
when we're staying away,
so we can like cook and make our meals.
And you better believe we're
having a second Thanksgiving!
(laughter)
- Third.
- Yeah, (laughter) pretty much.
-  Oh yeah, this is the
dining room, looks really nice.
- And then we even have
a little pantry area,
for all our snacks and food.
-  We got any good
snacks in there Ollie?
- Look, it's a happy birthday hat!
(laughter)
- Oh, there is, yeah.
- Then we've got the porch,
where Luna is hanging out.
-  Hey Luna.
-  (mumbles) your little area.
What you go going on?
- What's up Lulu?
(cool music)
- Look at this beautiful view.
We've got a huge balcony, with
a dining table area to sit.
We've even got a bar-be-cue, and a little
sitting area, for in the morning.
We can drink our tea and sit out
and see how beautiful it is.
What's funny is that two years
ago, when we stayed here,
we came here on this exact
day, and it was snowing.
-  Yeah. (laughter)
- And this year it is about
70 degrees. (laughter)
-  Yeah.
- So, it's not gonna be snowing,
but it's still really
nice, crisp, cool air.
-  Yeah.
- The boys are playing outside
and we're gonna head inside
to our bedroom, which is
just a cozy little room.
We've got a couch, and
a bed, a nice big closet
for all our stuff, which we
will definitely be unpacking.
-  We got some Lego BB‑8 stuff,
that's gonna be fun to put together, huh?
- And look at that BB‑8,
that's a little BB‑8.
-  Yeah.
- And we've got a bathroom
with a nice, big tub,
for the kids to take baths,
and me to take a bath.
- Nice sink.
- Yeah.
- Can I see the tub?
- You wanna see the tub?
Go check it out, boys.
-  Go see the tub, Dude.
Hey Finn, will it hold you too?
-  Whoa, I know how to get in here.
-  See if it fits both of you.
Hop in Finn.
-  Okay, is it enough room?
(kids talking over each other)
(laughter)
- And now we've got the
downstairs, which is
pretty neat because we
just have more space
so that we can spread
out and get comfortable.
-  You coming boys?
-  Yeah.
- I love having a laundry
room when we're on vacation.
We've got a nice, big laundry room
so we can keep our clothes clean.
-  Oh check this out.
We've got like a separate little-
-  Yeah!
-  Living space.
-  So this is where
Ollie's gonna be staying,
just in this area, he'll be sleeping
down here, it's nice and cool.
We've got a bedroom, this is
where my brother's staying.
Wait, this is where Dad's staying?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
Mom and Dad are staying in here.
(laughter)
And then actually if you come right
over here, it leads into the bathroom.
-  Oh cool.
- Yeah, and then if you go through here-
Look at this, it's like a maze.
-  Can keep going, can keep going.
-  We're back in the living room!
-  Finn's like, what?
Go, Finn, go.
- It's a circle!
How cool is that?
And then we've got one
more room over here.
One more room, ow, ow.
Alright, this is where Jimmy's staying.
-  Cool.
- And nice big closet.
-  Yeah, a big ole closet.
- Are you gonna fill this
whole closet up, Jimmy?
-  Uh yeah, definitely.
-  And then
there is a second patio,
leading out from this space as well.
- Yeah.
-  It's cool
-  (mumbles) down there!
-  You just gotta go around, Dude.
-  And probably put you shoes on.
Luna's going potty.
-  Say, hi Luna!
- Hi Luna!
(laughter)
- Say hi Meme, Papa.
(laughter)
- Alright, we've made it to Idyllwild,
but me and my dad are now
going grocery shopping.
We have a lot of snacks, but
we definitely are gonna need
a little bit more food
than just what we have,
especially for like dinner and stuff.
And we brought along Finn,
cause he's the craziest.
When you leave him alone,
well not alone, but just like
in a house where there's nothing
a lot to do, he goes crazy.
Huh Finn?
- Yeah.
- You gonna go grocery
shopping with Momma and Papa?
(Finn babbling)
- Yeah, you guys, it's so
good to be back in Idyllwild.
We love Idyllwild, it's just like,
it just feels so homey and comfortable.
So let's go shopping.
- Just look at the mountains.
- I know, look at those
mountains right there.
Hang on, let's see if I can show you.
Look at that, so pretty.
We love it here.
Um, what do you have, Finn?
(Finn babbling)
Is that a eggplant?
- He said egg.
- I know.
(laughter)
-  Is that
what you want for dinner?
No (laughter)
-  Ah, don't do it!
(laughter)
Alright, alright, good job.
- I didn't see a lot of squirrel.
They're out there, we're gonna find them.
-  Yeah, we are.
- We're gonna catch em, and
we're gonna bring em home.
-  Yeah. (laughter)
We got peanuts so we can
get the squirrels, okay?
- Yeah.
- Finn are gonna get one
candy bar, that's it.
-  No, Dad, that is
a giant candy bar, Finn.
- It does break the rule if it's
bigger than your head, you don't eat it.
(laughter)
Don't eat anything bigger than your head.
(laughter)
-  That is a giant candy bar.
- One candy bar.
(laughter)
- That sounds like
something Ollie would do.
Momma can I get one candy bar, sure.
And then he grabs the biggest one.
(laughter)
Alright, our cart is pretty
full, and op, my gosh.
-  It's
gotta go right here, okay.
-  My dad is just-
- Ahh
- Right here, right here.
-  We have no where to put it,
Finn, so you're gonna have to hold it.
-  We'll put it right here.
(laughter)
Right here.
- No!
(laughter)
- You sure?
- No.
- You sure?
Right here.
- No.
- Okay.
(laughter)
- Dad is on a roll today guys.
He doesn't stop making jokes.
And we are done, two carts full.
(laughter)
I think we're set for
the weekend, right Finn?
- I think we're set for the month.
-  Yeah. (laughter)
-  Ollie, what do you have?
- Dinosaur!
-  Whoa, who got you dinosaurs?
- Momma and Papa!
-  And Finn, Finn picked out
these awesome toys for you at the store.
- Triceratops.
- Yeah.
- Elephant, tiger, and a stegosaurus.
-  Yeah.
Although I think this is
one is a lion, not a tiger.
- Tiger.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Tiger, tiger.
(growls)
(laughter)
- The boys definitely needed some toys.
So that was very nice of
Finn to pick some out.
(growls)
Alright you guys, I have
donned my cabin onesie.
It's the classic red flannel plaid.
I shoulda got one for your dad
and brother too, pretty cool.
(laughter)
- Yeah, pretty sure.
- And Ollie and Finn are
wearing the cutest pajamas.
Finn, come here let me see!
Whoa, Buzz Light year.
Ollie, show me the laser, laser attack.
(laser sounds)
Cool PJs, Dude.
(relaxing music)
- Onto the pond.
Twirling round and round
and round in the foothills
until thump, he fell on his bottom.
Ouch, Little Bear was upset.
He felt dizzy and cold and lost.
Two big tears rolled
down Little Bear's face.
"Come on," said Red Bird,
"you're a very brave bear, remember?"
(reading continues)
- So cute.
- Slowly and carefully, Little
Bear walked back around the
pond, along the stream, up
the hill, and past Snow Bear.
♪ I'm walking through the forest ♪
♪ A very brave bear ♪
♪ My home is in sight ♪
♪ I can see the light ♪
- No.
♪ I'm no longer scared ♪
Alright, alright.
-  It's so funny
how the cutest moments are
when you take a step back
and let them do their thing.
They're so adorable and then
they just start fighting randomly.
You boys are so cute.
- Alright boys, we gotta lay down.
We're gonna finish this book now.
(fun music)
- I'm gonna let Missy handle that one.
She's the pro.
She reads them Goodnight Moon,
and they go to sleep like that.
It's the cutest thing.
Today was a good day.
We're back at the cabin, cabin life.
As you can tell, cabin life.
Look we just have like giant random
pine cones in this sleigh.
What do you think about that, Luna?
(laughter)
Luna has been so good.
She hasn't had a single accident.
She's just like following me around
the house and being so cute, huh?
Come on, Girl.
Come on, come help me in the Vlog.
Come help me in the Vlog.
Anyway, if you click the icon
in the corner, you can watch

we were at this house.

a cool throwback for
you guys to check out.
