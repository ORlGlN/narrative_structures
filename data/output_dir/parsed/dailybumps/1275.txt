I mean I already know all the parts
worth that this is our son baby
boys she's gonna do amazing things I see
a happy baby whining did you wake up
this morning and say I want to go to
swim class Wow look at those stretches
stretching me for swim class good
morning guys
we are off to swim that Sun is very
annoying huh you got a little milk
mustache dude today I'm gonna practice
some back floating huh and going
underwater hang on a minute
whoa B are early which is good sleeping
late and I left right on time this
morning so we are good although I still
got to get this bug dressed for swim
Riley's down for his nap he did so good
in class today and so he was definitely
exhausted and actually after we did um
swim we went and looked at some houses
with my mom and so he was like are you
serious so he was very very tired when I
come down so that's good
check this out guys it's officially gone
like I literally feel like I used every
last drop of this candle I loved this
candle see oh now I can see it says
hearth wick so if you're looking for a
candle I really liked it it's probably
not the best candle I really have not a
candle person so I really shouldn't be
giving advice on good candles to buy
because I haven't really experimented
with other brands I just really like
this one I recommend it but I don't
think it's the best I'm actually gonna
go ahead and change the one in here so I
can't even smell it anymore I feel like
I need like I don't feel like this thing
even works very well like it's barely
working so I don't know if I need to
actually get like the Scentsy brands I
know it's like the Walmart brand and I
just feel like I can't ever smell it but
I have like a million of these so maybe
I just need to new these maybe these
things are just like not scented right
see Hawaiian pineapple cilantro that
sounds weird that's not it mmm
smells like pineapple so it's not a good
actually telling you when it becomes
like fall time my house is going to
basically smell like fall and then when
it comes Christmas it's gonna smell like
Christmas but that in between can be
tough to figure out a good smell for my
house I don't really like this tropical
pina colada
not a fan yes I totally went wussy I did
the glazed cranberry pumpkin which i
think was in what was in there
originally
I really should suck it up and try the
Hawaiian pineapple which smells good but
I'm just I feel like it's too strong I
didn't move it so I'm thinking maybe it
just was since it was over in that
corner it wasn't really getting to like
over here so maybe if it's over here
then it'll like smell over here time I
start vlogging you start freaking out
why why why
you want junk outside are you hungry
I'll go swimming you have no idea you
have food right here what are you asking
me for food yeah you're a crazy kid

had a 1988 broom d'Elegance Cadillac

it's just been really cool seeing all
eating little Payton play and interact
and stuff so oh I didn't show you guys
look at this cool thing I got it's um so
you can do vegetables on the grill and I
like it because it has slots so you
still get a lot of the like smoke and
the fire and stuff and it just makes it
everything look really good and I don't
lose green beans anymore because green I
used to put it right onto the grill
green means we just fall right in the
