where's Olli where's all there is I see
you in there
you're not fooling anyone woody good
morning guys we were getting a slow
start to the day and that is a-ok
all he's hiding in his teepee come here
buddy where are you where is he where is
he you sneak you snuck out the back
didn't you
hey ollie Mama's gonna pick some clothes
for you what do you want to wear today
just another day in paradise
oh look he found his appearance ear he
always has to do a rescue mission and
grab something under there it's so funny
come on you got it hey buddy what's up
you find the ear no that's not that does
here hey guys
today is Wednesday we are still on baby
watch yeah that's woody in his hat we're
still on baby watch Missy has been
having her fast
okay you're gonna choke me put your hair
back on there you go you lost your ears
huh Missy was having some contractions
last night and they have been getting
more frequent so we're just waiting are
you waiting you're excited you excited
for Finn tickle the baby what Ryan your
car is basically falling apart
oh crap all I'm like I parked under a
stupid nest yesterday at the photo shoot
and birds just said I did the bottom of
my car he's kind of sad about it every
time like it rain he's like oh not to
get a detail I'm like oh my god I'm
crazy we haven't done that though so
there's there's marks and poop all over
it it's starting to become a real family
car with poop on it
we are headed to lunch with chiropractor
appointment very very soon and I'm
really looking forward to this
chiropractor equipment not so much for
him to like adjust me because I actually
really do not enjoy that the first time
you didn't have like it was kind of
weird that was cool now it just is
really uncomfortable I don't like it but
what I do like is he always feels my
belly to see what position Finn is in
always gonna posterior position which is
scary because it can make labor really
hard I can make a lot of things just
really difficult it actually can
increase your chances for a c-section so
we've been waiting waiting from the flip
and I feel like he's kind of flipped
because now I feel like his feet are
over here and normally his butt is over
here his feet are over here so we will
see if he is still in posterior or maybe
he's switched in his now anterior if he
is then that would be awesome if he
isn't I don't know if I have much hope
that he's gonna slip
because I feel like he's just really
comfortable in his position he's not
gonna want to like but we are at Arby's
for lunch and all he got a little kids
meal and it came with these cool little
toys and actually they're hanna-barbera
toys you guys remember the Jetsons the
Flintstones
who was the caveman do you know what he
was called my mom would know she loves
hanna-barbera cartoons but they have
this cool little toy that you like put
together
can I see oh that's cool
that's the Dino from the Flintstones huh
Oh Captain Caveman that's right
say rarr it's just so cool because this
was like a cartoon around forever ago
and like it's a classic and it's making
its way back I think that's really cool
yeah and the thing about old cartoons
and stuff is is there's probably a lot
of really inappropriate content now you
know to me like the times have changed
and so like I know a lot of cartoons
have like smoking and like super violent
deaths and stuff like that we don't
really do that nowadays but that's cool
that little Dino I can see your belly
it's quite big oh not the bottom of it
no we are headed into yeah it's a car
there's lots of cars we're headed into
misty chiropractor appointment to watch
him torture her she's okay buddy
he tell he's got a big head small that's
a good you will feel most likely on this
side just a movement of the bottom
swinging in from side to side and like
slowly on the right side here could be
hands everything feels good to me
that's another car huh
get all the cool cars in there that's
not that bad no she's okay buddy we are
now at the car wash and Olli is enjoying
swiveling in his chair aren't you buddy
that is a car yeah not our car here
comes our car him washing it yes
Popo had Popo on is dead
I know it's weird
there it goes
looks like we've got another California
fire going on and it is like just
starting to cuz I was black smoke it's
near my family's house so that is pretty
scary and that is a lot of smoke like
you can tell that's like a house or like
a building you think because it's like
small but a lot whereas if it was like a
brush fire I think it'd be a lot bigger
oh yeah that's definitely a building all
your mom and see where it is okay so she
can see it yeah my coloring up so I
wanted to tell you guys if you remember

alright guys I am going through photos
of the shoot that I did yesterday and
I'm trying to pick out some these ones
are cool a little bit different in that
red shirt I like those trying to picture
you know an album cover how I could do
it basically how I could design it how I
can use these pictures with it and it's
difficult because there's so many good
ones do you guys see these if you're
following me on instagram I've been
posting a couple so go follow me they're
linked down below in the description I
think my favorite from this session are
these ones these ones were just kind of
like random like cameras super up-close
like firing off really quickly and I
think I picked some good one but now the
hard part is trying to make something of
it so in the past I've actually hired
people to do album artwork on my songs
but for like a lion I think I actually
might do it myself but anyway I'm gonna
go to end today's blog Missy is putting
ollie down for the night and we're gonna
watch the finale of Big Brother
Vanessa's probably gonna win but I don't
want her to win I don't want Liz to win
