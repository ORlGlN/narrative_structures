go today we are going to the Warner
Brothers Studio Tour and Leavesden it's
about 40 minutes from London and we're
going to get to see all the old sets and
props and places where they filmed the
Harry Potter series so I'm very very
excited alright you guys we just made it
to the making of Harry Potter and I'm so
excited
basically it's a giant hangar with all
the sets props oh my goodness this is so
cool
just seeing the sign making a very
potter right now they're doing the
hogwarts in the snow so they show you
how to make it look like winter too
so I'm just entered this giant hall and
there's portraits of all of the actors
around the top rim and look at this they
have all of the actual costumes from the
new movie fantastic beasts and where to
find them that's so cool
and like I said it's Hogwarts in the
snow so everything is decked out for
Christmas look at this giant Christmas
tree
we're in this big long line to enter
Missy are you excited so excited she has
no idea what's about to happen I don't
know about you guys but when I was
little 11 12 years old reading Harry
Potter
I dreamed about sleeping in a cupboard
under the stairs and here it is the
cupboard under the stairs at number four
privet drive that's it I feel like if
you put your kid at night now you'd
probably be in trouble but the Dursleys
weren't very nice people
we're walking in for the Great Hall
right now I can't even right now oh my
gosh
it's probably one of the most surreal
moments ever you guys in the Great Hall
of course look at they have all of the
costumes for the different teachers
Flitwick Trelawny mad-eye moody there's
Minerva and Albus Snape Hagrid Filch I
look at the counters for house so the
toy is basically opened up to this giant
hall where they have all sorts of
costume design wigs sets look at here is
the moving staircase all the
proclamations from the inquisitorial
squad wardrobe distressing amazing that
they have to create costumes and then
they also have to destroy them like this
at the top of a spiral staircase they
were obviously in one of the towers they
found their beds at the last five four
posters hung with deep red velvet
curtains this is the Gryffindor boys
dolma tree decorated for Christmas
not a cool bed Ollie and a couple years
if you find your wizard this is where
you'll sleep so in the camera this
hallway looks like it could be like 50
feet but it's not nuts so this is the
mayor of era said you look into it and
you see yourself the version of yourself
that you want to see most basically
so we're looking into it let me just see
ourselves because we're perfectly happy
so this is probably a set that I've been
most looking forward to it's
Dumbledore's office yeah it's really
cool yeah that's so much cool stuff look
at all just the portraits for one
oMG you guys hit the potions classroom
and look at this one of the plots is
stirring itself that's so cool
these are all the animal actors from the
film and if you look closely at
Crookshanks one of the cats names was
Oliver who's a rescue cat
one thing I also did when I was a kid I
dreamt about flying on a broomstick this
is great this is the actual Nimbus 2001

upgrade that Harry got
not to make the brooms that come with my
hands
