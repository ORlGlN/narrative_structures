it on so I can show you guys how this
and we got all these fancy new Smart
Switches so we can control them via iPad
which is nice check out how does not
look amazing I can't wait till my she
sees that she's going to love that and
then we actually took out that little
Chandeleur there and put in flush light
which just makes it flow a lot nicer so
we were working on a lot of things today
and Luna poor little dude I just wants
to play but there's so much going on huh
okay she's being so sweet and lovely
today
and I cannot believe how big she's
getting she's probably twice the size
since we got her on Christmas huh how
much longer then you can run around the
backyard you want your rope actually he
put her leash on and then tied it to the
cushion and she doesn't move so it's
actually genius oh you have to stay stay

pants or something but yeah my dad
actually ended up taking the boys home
which is really nice of him

hopefully find something cool I really
don't like shopping and just try to
avoid it though it takes too much time I
just want to get home
look at these blue skies what's up oli
how was swim class oh yeah you want to
drive your big car whoa Ali's getting so
good at driving nothing can you steer
too we can great turn that way good job
it looks so good look at no hands yeah
he's been getting so good at driving
this thing and it's funny because
there's a little screw that restricts
the speed and we take out the screw
it'll actually go to the next setting
what do you think all you wanted to go
faster chickens are out here enjoying
fresh air - aren't you ladies these -
free and Susan's have no fear okay they
won't bail I might go that way no like
no you don't tell me you ain't my boss
you guys just listen to Missy huh
all right Papa's got a screwdriver he's
removing the screw to make it go even
faster we're gonna soup up this Hot
Wheel or power walk a little bit big
thing for the record don't know if this
is a good idea yeah he's like should we
have it be going faster yeah more power
let's do it all right hit it ollie
whoa you got steer dude oh my gosh Jim
that is fast wow that is so cool a big
zippered turn nice she narrowly avoided
that pool fence I wish they had these
for adults oh wait they do they call
go-karts

summer that we can stop Ollie what do
you think was it cool wait no it does
not refer like that
now now sit down and push on the gas
keep it like that push the gas and it'll
go backwards see now you don't need our
pot our help
now successfully put it forward he said
he's like I'm scared it's really fast
for Texas yeah poor Plant
that is so cool though I did not know
they go that bad I think it's like two
and a half miles with the screw and then
when you take off a few is five miles an
hour and this one is Flintstone powered
huh let me see drive this one Oh see I
see
nope things like I like this one better
mrs. OH how was your day I want to show

like the lighting is so like neat
looking I know and then look I put a I
put a hue bloom behind the TV
so I mess it up a little bit for the
kids can change it colors you know that
a little ambience it's so bright yeah
all the life is doing yeah I'd like this
whole room up honey yeah now the kids

what's in your room a cool light see we
got a green light floating behind the
chair we can change it any color we want
you like it yeah yeah he like decided he
wanted it behind the chair we came in

the salt lamp I was like really he's
like yeah and then I was like well where
do you wanna set this light up he said
behind the chair okay but you can't play
with it buddy he's so silly dude yeah
you all right guys I just got home and I
am now breaking out a bunch of my sewing
stuff actually have a sewing machine in
here I've got a ton of sewing things I
think how my little sewing box is
falling apart it's probably like busted
now and then I picked up a few things
that I used to have but I probably
either bent them or they're broken or
they've just gotten lost over the years
and I are a few extra things because I
am making I find Kelsey something for
baby juniper so if you guys will follow
them they're pregnant right now they're
actually on YouTube they're our bestest
friends we've been friends since high
school I just absolutely love Kelsey and
Corbin and so I want to make something
something special I used it so like a
ton before I had kids and I haven't sown
in years and I'm like I do this I have
like an idea of what I want to make her
I don't know if it's going to turn out
how I'm hoping but if it does turn out
I'm going to be really excited and I
can't wait to show you I wish I could
tell you right now when I'm trying to
make and then I can even probably get
advice from other people's and so but
I'm going to try and do it watch some
YouTube videos and see if I can make it
because it's not what you think it is I
don't know I'm singing but it's not easy
it's not something that I should have
probably been like oh yeah some good
schools the harder I thought I might
play to try and take on a little project
I'm going to kind of set up shop in here
hopefully it turns out I'll kind of take
you along know and kind of show you some
little things I'm doing but you won't
know probably fully winemaking till it's
done all right I've started on my
project and I just broke out my sewing
machine and look how dirty and dusty it
is I mean it is filthy I haven't used
this thing and so on I'm not even sure
if I remember how to like thread it and
stuff oh my gosh yeah I'm not even sure
if I remember how to thread it but
should be fun okay babe you've been
working on your project and I've been
working on mine and I want to show you
