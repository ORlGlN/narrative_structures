good morning she got a garlic pretzel at
the mall yesterday
and she left it in the car it was like
half in there and now it literally
smells like garlic in here today we do
an October favorites video and just
about to sit down and do it and I
realize that one of my favorite things
this month is what Gatorade we decided
to all get in the car and run down and
get a cater it because I actually
surprised me em all out listen I tried
as you drank them all I guess but I
should always have one at least always
have one in the fridge I think there's
like an empty bottle around here but
I'll go look hey one oh my god but it's
like it's old I'm drinkin I do a totally
drink
that's right now I might put it on some
ice and drink it
he got me Gatorade he got me too one for
the video and one for now the ride
totally put him to sleep you guys which
is another reason why we left cuz now we
can do the video that totally mean that
totally mean we totally manipulated our
son do you guys do that what makes your
kid fall asleep driving around
definitely does it for baby ollie
check out ollie he's like Scarface baby
right now do you see this pattern it's
from this e sweater no I looked at it
and I like I literally did all the tech
I was like what's wrong with his face
oh my gosh no Skylar stripes boy that's
what happens you got big cheeks oh my
gosh you can feel it even that's so
funny
cute boy think it's cute girl this cute
boy headed to get the oil changed
see you guys ROI and we're hoping that
they're actually going to take us
somewhere I'll finish filming the
favorites video so we have to get it out
yeah we have to do we need a place with
internet so you can edit it all and we
can actually put it up today so
hopefully it's up have like three hours
it down you think it's so I know my mom
always goes I'm like why are you still
there geez like 15 minutes at Walmart
he's already out he's been away does it
every time telling you guys the cart
like it just does it every time I think
we're really really lucky
well yeah guys I mean I think a lot of
babies that's normal but my cousin
Bailey she never fell asleep in the car
shall we screams I like she was dying
yeah so I was always like oh no I'm
totally gonna be the unlucky one and get
you know babied it's gonna be crying in
the car but he loves it it's just so
funny because like the cliche parenting
thing is like oh the baby's crying let's
put him in the car and drive around the
block you know so I'm always curious
like do people actually do that we could
totally do that okay not gonna lie I
totally just hit my head on the top of
the shuttle I'm always so afraid of that
it's like my biggest fear wouldn't
opening those things don't tell you why
why one time I opened it and my grandma
was sitting under it and I slammed it on
her head
oh my gosh Missy every time I opened
that I always think I stand out on my
grandma had one yeah it was so it was
like the worst thing ever I didn't mean
to of course it's like I shut it and I
didn't know it hit her right on the head
oh babe oh my god so this is our ride we
get a little shuttle that all our junk
back here and we have to put the car
seat in with a seat belt which is
proving to be difficult you get mad okay
I get this stupid damn all right

having this delicious lunch I'm getting
headache yeah Odin aching
chickens Bella's so boring you guys the
way she does it she gets everything off

unless you mean focaccia bread yeah this
is like the best bread ever got all done
editing Missy's new video and I'm trying
to upload it on Panera's Wi-Fi and let

just a baby guard she got drummed out
headed to the gym it's a little bit
later than I usually go has sucks going
this late cuz there's so many people I
prefer to go and there's not that many
people a lot of people don't realize
that everyone at the gym is at a
different level and they're all trying
to do the same thing which is get better
you know even if you see a guy walking
around the gym who's super buff he
probably has the same mentality that he
wants to work his butt off because he
wants to get to another point you know
so don't ever let that like get you guys
if you if you think about going to the
gym but you're like oh it's so
embarrassing going cuz either you might
be out of shape or overweight or
anything like that don't be embarrassed
because everyone there is trying to
better themselves
