was a bit rough I had really strong
contractions to the point where I really
thought it was it
I couldn't sleep through them and I was
just waiting till I couldn't walk
through them so I finally was like I'm
just going to get up because I can't
sleep and I'm in excruciating pain so I
was like I'm gonna walk around the house
I ended up making some cookies and then
I just slowly died away and I'm like
gosh last of like all night so I woke up

induce labor or give you contractions
