- Good morning you guys.
Look at my snazzy little boy.
- Hey guys, I have to show you something.
- He has to show you something.
What are you gonna show them?
He woke up this morning and
saw a deflated bouncy house.
- Yeah, and it's really flat.
- It's really flat because it's not on.
We're gonna turn it on later though, okay?
Missy is gettin' the boys ready.
Ollie is wearing a tie.
Fin is wearing a bow tie.
Looks pretty dapper.
Babe, you look so cute.
We're all dressed and sharp this mornin'
gettin' ready to go to church
for a really awesome Easter service.
I'm really looking forward to it.
You are so cute this mornin' Mr. Fin.
(laughs)
Alright.
It's time to do Ollie's hair.

Oh, hi there kids.
Happy Easter.
Do you like what the
Easter Bunny brought ya?
- Yep.

The Easter Bunny brought me something?
-  Yeah.
Go open it.
- Oh goodness.
I'm nervous.
Oh a box.
- Yep.
It's Beauty and the Beast.
- Is it Beauty and the Beast?
Oh my Gosh, that's so cool.
-  Yeah.
I got from the Easter Bunny too.
-  Do you like it?
- It's a little tea set?
-  It's a fine china tea set.
- That's so cute.
And one's Chip.
-  I wonder what
the Easter brought you.
-  Chip's behind here.
- Ahh.
That is so pretty.
Thank you.
-  You're welcome (laughs).
- Ahhhhhh.
- You can eat it.
Ha, you ate the Easter Bunny poop?
-  Yeah.
-  How adorable is that Babe?
- This is so cute.
Chip!
-  It's an exact
replica from the movie.
- That's so cute.
-  And look at Mrs. Potts.
She even has her little earring.
-  Mama, it's Beauty and the Beast.
- Oh, it's so cool.
-  Mama?
-  Do you like it?
- Yeah, I love it.
It's so cute.
-  It's one of two-thousand too.
They only made two-thousand of these.
-  Hey.
- Wow.
I'm gonna need to have a little tea party.
-  Either that or
a hot chocolate party.
Whatever you want, ya know?
- Yeah (giggles).
-  Mama?
-  But you're
always sayin' how cool
it'd be to have an
actual tea set, ya know?
- Yeah.
Yeah baby?
-  And it's fine china.
So you can keep it in your hutch too.
- There's Chip.
- Yeah I can see that.
-  Isn't that cool Ollie?
- It's got a little
bit broken right there,
but that's okay.
-  Yeah.
- Yeah it's okay (laughs).
- I know Easter isn't about gifts,
but I saw that for Missy
and I had to get it for you
because it looked so cool
and I was like, I cannot pass this up.
(laughs)
- It's pretty awesome.
I love it.
-  And the boys are so happy
with all their little toys and candy.
- Can you open this?
- Yes.
-  We will open that.
- There's an egg in there.
- Oh, bubble gum.
One of my favorite thing in the morning.
(laughs)
We're not gonna eat it right now, okay?
-  Yeah, let's
eat some breakfast boys
and then we gotta go to church, okay?
- Can you help clean up
all this Easter Bunny poop?
Who did this?
-  Yeah Fin, go eat all those.
- No, not eat 'em.
-  Hey Ollie.
Can you clean up all
the Easter Bunny poop?
-  Put 'em in your basket.
-  Can you do that for us
and then you can have a piece of candy.
Sound good?
- Yeah.
-  Okay.
Missy made me a very delicious
breakfast before church.
I actually just got done
gettin' all this meat
ready for tonight.
-  Hey guys!
-  I have all this filet mignon
sitting out and I seasoned it up.
I'm actually gonna sous vide it tonight.
This is my first time sous
viding big roasts like that.
But I'm pretty excited for
how it's gonna turn out.
- It was my idea.
-  It was Missy's idea (laughs).
She's gettin' some eggs.
We're eatin' breakfast in a hurry.
We gotta leave in at
least 15 minutes, okay?
So finish your pancakes, alright?
- Okay.
-  Okay.
You too Fin.
You don't get off the hook
just cause you're dressed all cute today.
- Uh, eggs.
-  Eggs, yes.
There's eggs
on the flowers, huh?
- Eggs.
-  Eggs.
- That's for Easter.
Mmm hmm.
- Guys, we forgot our camera (laughs).
We're so bummed but we're
gonna use the phone and--
- Luckily in this day and age,
you're never really without a camera.
- No.
You can always capture whatever you want.
So we are off to church.
We're all dressed.
The boys are dressed and he's actually
playing with his toy.
He's like obsessed with this thing.
Technically, Fin got it,
but they're willing to share.
So it's not a big deal.
Ollie's so great going to nursery now.
He has no problems and
he has a ton of fun.
Fin, on the other hand definitely
has more issues right now.
He's definitely in that
phase of separation anxiety.
So, it's a little bit tough.
We'll see what happens.
Hopefully, hopefully he
just does good for me today.
It's Easter.
So anyways, off to church we go (laughs).
(crying)
(laughs)
-  Trying to take photos.
The little boys looks so cute
and they just ended in Fin being like,
don't hug me.
Ollie, guess who's here.
- What?
-  Mimi and Papa.
- Mimi and Papa?
-  Yeah.
Oh jeez.
(laughs)
-  Oh my God.
(crying)
-  That was quite
the Easter hug Ollie.
- That's all he said.
- Give him a hug, a real hug.
(peaceful music)
- When they bow down with
their faces to the ground,
but the men said to them,
why do you look for the
living among the dead?
He is not here.
He is risen.
Remember how he told you
why he was still with you in Galilee,
the Son of Man must be delivered
into the hands of sinful men?
Be crucified and on the
third day, raise again?
-  Hey buddy.
- They gave me a lot of stuff.
-  You got some stuff?
- They got me
this.
-  Oh, that's so cool.
-  You got neat stuff?
-  Oh, you got a little bow tie?
-  Yeah.
-  Oh, and a cool little bracelet.
Ollie got goodies.
- He says that that's his too.
-  Oh (laughs).
Both you boys did so good, didn't you?
- Yeah.
- Did you have fun?
Okay, let's get your shoes on.
- Alright, guess what guys?
Boys, Mimi and Papa got you
a little Easter present.
Wanna see what it is?
- Yeah.
- Alright.
Go check it out.
Go in the living room.
-  In the living room.
- Ahh!
Oh ohh!
This is mine?
-  That one's yours.
-  They're scooters.
Excuse me.
-  Fin, do you like yours?
That's yours.
Ollie, who's on your scooter?
- Spiderman.
-  Spiderman!
- Yeah, and I wanna play out.
-  Look and you
got a Spiderman helmet.
- Oh.
-  What did you get Fin?
Are you excited?
-  He got a--
- This is a bike that
then turns into a scooter.
- That's so cool.
He loves anything with wheels.
He is going to love this!
You guys look so cool.
-  Oh, look at him.
-  He's ready to go.
Are you ready?
-  Good for him.
- And these are really
cool cause the wheels
are like rubber and so they--
They'll like spin a lot easier.
-  Yeah, the other
ones, we had plastic wheels.
- They're just not right.
- But ride this.
-  Oh my goodness.
-  Look how cool you look.
-  You look so good.
- Alright, Fin gets his on now.
Ooh.
It looks like the size
of your head (laughs).
Look how cool you look dude.
Fin wanted it to be a scooter,
so let's try that now.
- There you go.
-  Oh my gosh.
He's so cute (laughs).
What do you think of that (laughs)?
Okay Fin, your turn.
You gotta push with your foot.
- Show Fin how you push,
push, push with your foot.
-  There you go.
And then if you push really hard,
you can just stand on it and it will go.
-  There you go.
It takes lots of practice,
but hang on and we'll just
take you on a little ride.
-  I feel like the bumps
are actually not helping us.
Go Fin.
Use your foot.
- Bring--
- [Missy} Use your Foot.
Go.
There you go.
-  Good job Ollie.
-  There you go Fin, go.
There you are.
Yay!
Missy, he's doin' it.
Oh, he started doin' it.
- Da, da.
-  Da, da, da.
You're gettin' it!
-  That's so cool dude.
- Almost there.
-  Almost there.
(laughs)
- Ollie, ready to watch?
Look.
Ready?
Push and then foot up.
-  See how she's riding.
Say good job Auntie.
- Good job Auntie.
- Thanks Ollie.
- Thank you so much for the scooter!
I love it.
- You love it?
-  Aah (laughs).
-  Yeah, you wanna try that next?
-  Alright, our Easter celebration
has officially begun.
Oh no.
DJ, she talked you into
riding in this thing with her?
(laughs)
Are you prepared dude?
Get that thing tight in
case you go upside down.
Missy likes to do flips.
Are you okay with flips?
(laughs)
He literally can't even speak right now.
He doesn't know what's gonna happen.
(revving)
He's got a last will and testament, right?
(laughs)
So while Missy's ridin'
around on the go-cart,
Randy has found my RC cars.
Woo!
You got the monster truck?
Woo!
(jubilant music)
I don't think you could of asked
for a more perfect day though.
It is so beautiful out here.
The sun is shining.
We got like a cool breeze.
The skies are blue.
Look, there they go (laughs).
And it's such a great day
I think to be with family,
to remember Easter and to enjoy yourself.
I am really excited.
Today is gonna be a fun day.
(exciting music)
That literally bunny-hopped (laughs).
Goin' up the road (laughs).
Randy literally knocked the rod.
- It looks like it's all there.
(laughs)
- The drive shaft is gone.
- Looks like it's all there though.
(laughs)
-  Are you gonna
really pop it on (laughs)?
- That is hot.
-  You found the other part?
- Yep, right here.
- That's cool.
(laughs)
- You might actually
not want to touch it.
-  That is so funny.
- That should be it.
That attaches with an Allen wrench.
- Don't pick it up.
It's hot.
- It was hot when I first touched it.
- This is how we do Easter
ladies and gentlemen.
And this happened you guys.
We got a bouncy house for the kids.
You wanna go inside?
(jovial music)
-  Alright kiddos.
The Easter Bunny came this morning
and we looked out in our courtyard.
There was a ton of eggs.
So who's up for collecting eggs?
- Me.
-  Can you guys collect some eggs?
- Yeah!
-  Alright.
We gotta make some omelettes,
so we need you guys to go out there.
-  Want the big one.
-  You want the big one?
- Yeah.
-  You gotta be fast.
Okay?
- You've got to get all of them.
There's like a lot of them.
-  I want, I want them.
-  Woo!
-  Go Fin, go!
Go Olivia!
(laughs)
-  There's some with money.
(laughs)
-  You gotta pick some up
and find eggs.
What happened?
-  Fin just throws it.
He's like, that's how
you get the candy out.
(jovial music)
Whoa Ollie, there's a big green one.
Whoa, is there some in the fireplace too?
- A egg.
I got a egg.
-  You found the golden one!
(laughs)
- A Skittle one.
-  Oh, a Skittle one.
- Mama, I got a Skittle egg.
- Aah!
(jovial music)
-  I don't think I've
ever seen Oliver move so fast.
(laughs)
He's running.
Ollie, you're a pro, dude.
- Yeah.
-  I think we're
making up for that time
we went to the Easter Egg Hunt.
After all the Easter eggs were found
and Ollie couldn't get any.
- I remember that.
- Look, I found a pink one.
- There's more?
- Yeah.
-  He's seriously a pro at this.
How's Fin doin'?
- He's doing great.
He actually figured it out.
Now he's competing with his brother but--
- Look how much I got.
Look how much I got.
-  Let me see Fin.
Whoa!
-  You need to
empty 'em and go get more.
Cause there's like two-hundred out here.
(laughs)
We are on the search for
at least one more big one.
We told them that there
might be one over here.
And everyone's a little warm.
- Colder, colder.
(laughs)
-  Gettin' warmer.
- I don't know.
-  Did you get the ladder
out and put it on the roof?
-  No, I did not.
The Easter Bunny did
not put it on the roof
when he pooped it out.
I think that's what they do.
(laughs)
- I don't know if you got the story right.
(laughs)
Unsanitary.
-  Olivia's doin' so good.
-  Come over here and look.
-  Ow.
-  Oh.
-  Ooh!
Let me see it CJ.
What!
-  Oh, that was supposed to be mine.
(laughs)
-  CJ's buyin' lunch.
-  Look at all your eggs.
(jubilant music)
-  Alright CJ.
How'd ya make out?
- Good.
-  Good?
You got a ton of candy?
Oh my goodness!
And forty bucks, right?
- Yeah.
(laughs)
- For mommy, right?
(laughs)
-  Yeah. We got a ton of candy.
We just emptied out
all the eggs basically.
Let me see Olivia.
You have a chocolate face.
You and Fin have chocolate face.
They just keep stealing
all the melted chocolate
and like putting it everywhere.
It's slightly gross but, ahh.
That was cute.
Good sharing.
(laughs)
He's like, sure I'll--
Oh gosh (laughs).
That's so cute.
You're gonna be a good
big sister (laughs).
- Alright.
While all the kids are
opening their Easter eggs,
I have just finished Easter Dinner.
Check this out.
We got green beans in a
garlic ginger with peppers,
mashed potatoes and gravy,
and filet mignon roasts.
I'm so nervous about this
because I've never sous
vide filet mignon roasts.
So I'm gonna cut into it now
and see what it looks like.
But I'm hopin' it looks good.
Yum.
It looks super good.
-  Oh yay!
- I did it medium so everyone can ya know.
Some people like it underdone.
-  For dad.
He likes well-done.
- I like mine cooked.
(laughs)
- Medium is supposed to
be the best temperature
for this cut of meat.
-  Yeah.
- It's supposed to be the most tender.
You get most of the flavor out so--
- My dad doesn't like well done,
but he's definitely on
the more like cooked side
and we're on the more rare side.
So there's always a struggle of like--
- Like a good vet can save it.
-  Yeah.
That's true.
Me and Bryan like it pretty rare.
Yum.
It looks good.
I think that's plenty
of food for all of us.
We'll see.
- We'll see.
(laughs)
-  It looks delicious.
-  Amen.
-  Let's eat.
It's buffet-style, so just grab a plate.
Grab what you want.
(delightful music)
-  Check this out you guys.
These kids are loving this waterslide.
Whoa!
Gotcha!
Go Ollie!
Oh my gosh.
Hey dude, how does the water feel?
- I just lay down on my belly
and go down and jump in the water.
-  Do it again!
Go.
(exciting music)
Fin is standing very dangerously
close to the splash-zone.
(laughs loudly)
Got you!
(laughs)
Fin doesn't even care.
He's like, I want in.
- You want your bathing suit on?
Ahh.
-  Oh jeez!
-  Oh (laughs).
-  Oh jeez!
-  Oh (laughs).
Karma, you silly dog!
(laughs)
(jovial music)
-  Look at these two
being all lovey-dovey.
How ya doin' Na?
I just did some training with her,
which is why her Gentle Leader's on.
And she did so good.
Oh, you givin' her hugs?
You givin' her hugs?
Hey baby girl, did you
have a good First Easter?
- You can feel it.
-  Did you have a good Easter?
- Mmm.
(kissing mwah)
-  Ah, he gave her a kiss.
- Aww.
-  Hey dude.
You watchin' what?
- Wing--
-  Oh, are you?
- Yeah.
-  Did you have
a good Easter, buddy?
- Yep.
-  Do you give it a thumbs up?
Give Easter a thumbs up.
(laughs)
I love you kiddo.
- I love you too.
-  Missy always makes fun of me
for playing with the spinner.
You like it too.
You know you do.
- I do like it, but I can stop.
I can get it so fast.
-  She's so proud
of herself right now.
I put--
- Oh.
-  Mrs. Potts--
- Oh, that looks so cute.
-  In your china hutch.
- I love it.
-  It's like just chillin'
with all our other china.
-  I just love their little faces.
-  Yeah, I know.
-  It's like
they're really watchin' us.
(laughs)
That's so cool.
I love it!
- It looks good in there, huh?
We had such a fantastic Easter
and I hope you guys did as well.
Let us know in the comments
what you guys did for Easter.
Thanks for watchin' today's video.
We will see you manana.
Fin, can you say bye?
Say bye.
Ah ha, he's waving.
Bye.
- Ahhh.
(ding)
(lighthearted music)
