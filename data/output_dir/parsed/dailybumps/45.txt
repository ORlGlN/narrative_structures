-  Good morning Luna.
Why you sleeping there?
-  Good morning!
- You're so cute, Finn.
So are you.
(laughs)
Good morning guys.
We were just admiring Luna in the house,
she was
(bell rings)
taking a little snooze, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Are you looking at Momma?
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?
Aw, I think he loves me, guys.
You love Momma?
-  Oh look.
- Oh, oh, look who else loves Momma.
Luna! (laughs)
Hi.
-  I think Karma too.
-  You think Karma loves Momma too?
-  Yeah.
- I think so too.
I think he loves me the mostest.
Karma, do you love me?
He's like "Ah, yeah?"
Come here, boy!
Hi puppies!
You guys are all so cute.
Yeah, we are having a really nice morning,
isn't a beautiful day?
As you can tell, we aren't
getting a winter this year.
(laughs) I think I've
come to terms with that.
But yeah, we actually
skipped school today.
If you guys don't know, I took Ollie to
school on Tuesday, and it was clearly
just not a school day and everyone
was still out, and even
the teacher wasn't in,
so I think school is officially
starting next Tuesday,
so I was like, I'm not
gonna take him there
just for daycare to like watch him,
'cause I do like being with this boy.
He is a lot of fun to be with.
Right, Ollie?
- Yeah.
(Missy laughs)
- We're just hanging out
today, having a chill day.
I'm still doing a lot of horse stuff.
Just kind of still looking, I think I have
a really, really good possibility of the
one I'm getting, and
I've looked at and stuff,
but nothing is 100%
until we actually get it,
or pick it up I guess,
or go to pick it up.
We'll see, we'll see, I might have a horse
by this weekend actually,
it might be interesting.
But I am super sore
after riding yesterday,
but not like so sore that
I couldn't get on a horse.
I could totally get on a horse today,
but I'm gonna take today off and then
tomorrow hopefully I'll be able to ride,
but I am pretty sore.
My ankles are sore 'cause
I definitely twisted
them in some weird way yesterday,
but not too bad, they're not
swollen or anything like that.
So I think all is good, I
just gotta build up my muscle.
The dogs are playing tug of war,
it is the cutest thing ever! (laughs)
Look at that!
They are so sweet.
I just think it is so adorable how
Karma kind of hated Luna
when we first got her,
and Luna was so annoying and he
for a long time just couldn't stand her,
and now they are literally best friends.
It is the sweetest thing.
Is Karma your best friend, Luna?
Are they best friends, you think?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and Karma, I think Luna's
definitely grown on Karma, 'cause
he enjoys being around
her and playing with her,
so it's kinda cute.
I think you've made him young again,
'cause he was getting to be older,
and now he's just like, he's playing again
a lot more.
What are you doing?
(gasps) Are you picking Mommy a flower?
Look at pretty these flowers
are, even in the winter.
Look how pretty that is, thanks bud.
(chuckles) I think Finn's
over there trying to...
What are you doing?
You trying to get any?
Your brother will help you.
What do you have there?
(gasps) A flower?
Oh, oh he's putting
behind it behind his back,
what do you have?
(gasps) A flower!
Look at both of these beautiful flowers,
thank you boys.
- Luna's just chewing up the flower.
-  I know, bad Luna!
- I think I'm addicted, you guys,
and I feel like I have to come clean,
I have to tell you guys, I have
a La Croix problem. (laughs)
Yeah, so I'm kinda started this new thing
where I don't drink sugar in sodas,
so I stocked up on La
Croix, which by the way
they have a cola one, it's okay.
Passionfruit, tangerine.
And I have completely
stopped drinking soda,
I've completely stopped
drinking diet sodas,
or like the 10 ones with only
10 calories, or whatever.
I just was decided, and
I didn't even really
decide it as like a new year thing.
I kinda decided it as a me thing,
I was like, you know what?
I just always feel really not good after
drinking that all day.
But I'm the type of person who needs to
have a drink all day with me.
So La Croix is a great thing 'cause
it's just like sparkling water,
and there's nothing in it.
So yes, I am addicted to La Croix.
I wanted to ask you guys
if you drink La Croix too,
what is your favourite flavor?
Let me down below in the comments.
I think I've tried almost all of them,
I definitely cleaned out the grocery store
last time I was there because I was like,
I don't want any excuses, I don't wanna
drink any soda, I threw
all the old soda out,
I was like, not drinking this.
New year, new me, I'm
gonna try it. (laughs)
Not like a resolution, I
don't wanna call it that,
and I don't wanna say, I'm not gonna eat
or drink sugar, 'cause
obviously that's a lie.
But yeah, definitely
had to cut back on soda,
and La Croix is helping.
But I just got home after
running a bunch of errands,
and the house is empty, so I'm pretty sure
Missy is out looking at another horse
here in town, and she's gonna throw
some of it up on her Insta story
because she forgot the camera.
- Momma doesn't feel good.
-  She doesn't?
- Yeah.
-  Oh that's so sad!
Shall we help her?
- Yeah.
- So Missy and the boys just got back
from checking out the horse.
Missy got rather car sick
on the way here.
I have peppermint.
I think peppermint oil.
All right, I'll just put some
peppermint oil right there.
(Missy mutters)
A little bit together.
Smell it, there you go.
- That's good, thank you.
-  Is that helping?
Okay. (chuckles)
- I was at, was rocking out,
I saw some cool clouds, look!
-  What!?
Whoa, those do look cool!
What do you see, buddy?
- I just cool clouds,
but look at that cloud!
-  What does it look like?
- It looks like a carrot.
-  A carrot?
- Yeah.
-  Um, you guys, it actually does
kinda look like a carrot. (laughs)
- Bow!
-  Whoa, what
are you doing? (laughs)
(babbles)
Oh, you threw the ball
all the way down there?
- Yeah.
-  You're gonna have to go get it.
- Okay.
-  No, you don't have
to get, I'm just kidding.
(laughs)
- Get it.
-  You want me to get it?
- Yeah.
- Finn threw the basketball
all the way down the stairs.
Now we gotta go get it.
We're going on an adventure.
Oh, it's in the dirt, guys.
Aw.
- No, it's right next to the sim-play.
-  Yeah it is, huh?
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah.
-  Oh my gosh, look at that.
- Whoa, there's a puddle of water!
Careful Finn, don't
step in the water, okay?
(moans)
(Bryan laughs)
Come here, you're okay.
What, Ollie?
- Finn, if you jump in
the water, that's okay,
we can wash you off, okay?
- That's true, if you get in the water,
we'll just wash you off, okay?
(laughs)
The skies today are beautiful though,
sun is going down.
(pleasant folk music)
- Mom feels better now!
-  She does?
- Yeah.
- Aw, well that's good. (laughs)
I'm sure both the boys jumping on
top of you helped as well.
- Yeah, they like ran in here.
(Bryan laughs)
I'm feeling a lot better, okay sweetie.
-  I told you.
- I was so sick, I was like
I'm gonna throw up in there.
- Yeah.
Peppermint.
Works good, huh?
You like lavender, huh?
- Yeah.
-  He likes lavender
on the bottom of his feet.
- I feel a little on fire.
-  Oh yeah, I forgot it can tingle.
- Yeah. (chuckles)
- Shh, Missy went to go get pizza.
And look what I did.
They're watching Olaf's
Frozen Adventure with Olaf.
(laughs)
You guys are so cute.
Are you hungry?
- Yeah.
- It's bed time for these boys.
- Daddy, watch this.
-  Let me see, whoa!
You flying through the
air like an airplane?
- No.
(Bryan laughs)
-  Are you guys
sleeping in the woods tonight?
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah, with our
good old friend Charlie, huh?
-  Yep.
- Yep.
Boys are getting ready
for bed, all right boys?
Give me hugs!
Give me hugs, good night, good night!
Ooh, that was a good hug!
(yells)
Good night, I love you.
- I love you too.
-  (chuckles) All
right, get in the tent.
Get in the tent, close the doors.
And then go night night, kay?
Good night guys.
-  Night!

So we put the kids to
bed, and they did so good,
they're doing amazing sleeping
in their beds, aren't they?
- Yeah, honestly it's been like
the best decision that we've made.
- Yeah.
- And it was definitely a little bit of
rough patches but I feel like we've
worked through most of them now, and
- Totally.
- (clicks) They're good.
- Yeah, it's been awesome.
- Our biggest worry now
is that if one of the other
isn't here, I dont know how they'll
sleep without each other.
- Oh yeah.
How are they gonna sleep apart?
- They just like love each other
so much right now.
- Yeah.
- It's so cute.
- So Missy and I did something fun today,
and we wanna show you
guys our new tattoos.
Missy and I have been wanting to get
tattoos for a while that are matching,
and we decided that we're
gonna do it our wrists,
and we're gonna show you them right
now?
Ooh, ah!
(laughs)
Yeah, so
- Check them out.
-  Check it out.
We have paper cranes on our wrists,
mine is super light, ugh!
I don't know why it turned out like that.
- Your tattoo artists was
just kinda not feeling it.
- I guess, it's supposed
to get darker, we'll see.
What do you guys think
of our matching tattoos?
They're paper cranes,
which I guess are a symbol
of health and longevity,
- Yeah.
- So that's cool.
Happiness,
it's like a happy bird,
- Yeah!
- It's supposed to be a happy bird.
(laughs)
The crane.
- Yeah.
That's pretty cool, I like it. (chuckles)
- Yeah, it's cool.
But yeah, this is one of
those semi-permanent tattoos.
- They're the henna ones.
I actually still have the eyelashes.
- Oh yeah, and my Star Wars
one is completely gone.
(laughs)
- Yeah, it's like on this
side, I was turning it around.
-  Oh yeah, you
have the little eyelashes.
- It's when they get to this point
- Barely.
- It's like, yeah, I need to wash my arm.
-  Yeah, you can probably just
wash it off at this point.
-  Yeah, I seriously had tried it,
it's like there.
-  Look at that
crane, it turned out
so good on yours babe.
-  It's so cute, I like it.
I like where it's at too.
- But anyway, that is
all for today's video.
