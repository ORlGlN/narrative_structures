- Can you please let mama sleep past 5:30?
- No.
(deep sigh)
(upbeat music)
- Good morning guys, it is time for school
and it is such a beautiful day.
It's cold, it's chilly, it's windy
but it rained which is always nice.
So we're headed to school, huh?
- Yeah.
You look so cute.
(upbeat music)
- I am home, Ollie is
dropped off at school
and now I'm hanging out
with my other little dude.
How you doing?
- Good.
And Karma's like oh my gosh, oh my gosh,
we're vlogging, we're
vlogging, we're vlogging.
Hey, guess what?
Nuna's getting groomed
right now in the yard
and your next.
If you guys don't know,
we're actually trying
to grow out his fur in a nice way
and maybe get it back to where it was
before we shaved him years and years ago.
Cause the lady that I'm working
with right now she's like,
"I think we can get it back,
we just have to be patient."
Alright, I'm at the barn now
hanging out with my little guy.
Hi, dude, how's it going Nacho?
Life with my horse has been amazing.
It's been a hard month.
We've definitely had our struggles.
He had hives for a long
time, which are now gone.
Foot was hurting, which is all better.
And he had some pain issues in his back
and he's feeling great.
Huh guy?
Oh, I was going to give him a treat.
I bought these treats the other day
and they're so cute.
This is the brand, right.
And it's basically an oatmeal cookie.
And it smells like an oatmeal cookie
and I even ate some.
I read all the ingredients.
It's just like oats, and like,
cinnamon, canola oil, agave.
So it's low sugar and low carbs,
so it wasn't like super sweet
but it was actually pretty good.
And I think he loved them,
he's like, "Uh, are you going
to give me one of those?"
Ugh, they smell so good
and they're like smooshy like a cookie.
You want one?
What do you think of that?
He's like, "It's so chewy."
(calm music)
Alright, Nacho is all saddled and yep,
I'm riding english again.
I'm going to tighten this up.
Actually have a new bit in for him.
Actually just gave him a new treat
so he's chewing, but I got a new bit.
It's something that I thought
he actually used previously
before I owned him but it's
a little bit different.
It has a roly thing in it.
Alright, I'm going to
do a little trotting.
Mainly what we really are working on,
obviously my own posture and stuff
but for sure him, his head.
He doesn't put his head down
so we are kind of
working on that together.
(calming music)
We just got done trotting
for about 10 minutes
and he did really, really good.
I do have a couple things
working against me.
One, the wind, he doesn't like the wind.
It's scary to him and
when he hears the wind
he starts kind of
trotting a little faster.
Which is totally fine,
I can like handle him
and tell him to slow down his trot.
It actually rained last
night so the ground
is a little slippery.
Not super slippery, I don't want a canner
but I have felt him, like oops
that was slippery, like just now.
(laughing)
Nothing to bad but it is
good to be really careful
if you're in the arena after it rains.
But I don't know if you guys noticed
but he definitely did start
to relax his head towards the end.
So I had to lower it a bit
and I've just been
continuously working on that.
When his head is down it means
he's relaxed and submissive.
Actually when his heads up
it kind of means he's like,
"What's going on, what's going on?"
and he's like looking
around at everything.
So right now, he's doing good,
and I love when his head is down.
I like to massage his
neck, tell him good boy
so that he knows it's good
to keep your neck down
because then you get massages.
Overall doing really good.
I think I'm going to keep doing stuff
but I'm going to stop vlogging now.
So I actually just rode for about an hour
and then I was just like,
"I want to ride him without the saddle."
And now I'm riding him bareback,
it's actually pretty fun.
So I'm going to record a little bit of it.
(calming music)
I'm going to attempt to take a nap on him.
Hopefully I don't fall
off or get kicked off.
Here we go.
(nervous yelling)
That was so much fun
and I'm going to have
to do that more often
and he was so good.
Good boy, Nacho.
(loud boom)
So I just did all this
riding and I actually left.
And as I was leaving I
looked down at my ring
and I am missing my entire diamond.
I'm totally stressing out.
So I don't know if you guys know
but Bryan got this for me years ago
and we actually vlogged
it, it was for Christmas.
He just upgraded my ring,
it's super special to me
and the entire diamond is literally gone.
So as you can see, it's
not even just the diamond,
it's like the prongs and everything.
It must've just got ripped off.
So lesson learned on wearing
rings with diamonds down here,
I'll probably not be doing that anymore
but I'm just looking everywhere
for where it could've possibly fallen off.
The truth is, I got here, I
immediately put my gloves on.
So, I check my gloves,
they're not in there.
Gosh, if it fell in here,
she was literally sweeping
as I was doing stuff,
it literally could have just been swept up
and been put into the big pile of poop.
Or it could have fallen off in the arena.
I did take my gloves off in
the arena for a little bit
to just ride without them.
If it's in the arena, it's gone.
Maybe it actually fell off before.
I wonder if this footage
actually shows whether or not
my diamond was on.
You guys go back in the
vlog and look to see
if in the past, when I got
here, if my diamond was there.
That will be good information to know.
I feel like it was, I feel
like I would have noticed it.
If I had got here and there was no ring on
or no diamond on it.
I've got some investigating to do.
Actually, I'm going to
look at the footage to.
I'm going to need some candy.
I'm so bummed, this
totally stresses me out.
I cannot believe I lost my diamond.
So I just looked at the
footage as quickly as I could
while I was sitting here and
I think when I was talking to
Karma I think I saw it
cause it wasn't like this.
It looked like the diamond was there
so I'm sure I must've lost it here
and I don't see how I could possibly
find it here at the barn again.
Especially if it fell off in the arena
but even if it wasn't the arena
even if it was just anywhere in the barn,
she sweeps that constantly.
It's gone if so.
(sigh)
I'm so bummed, this seriously sucks.
I mean honestly, lesson learned.
I probably should've
known not to bring a ring
that is pokey down here.
You are just so rough and
you don't even realize
it sometimes when you're moving your hand
and doing things, you
don't even realize that
you're probably going to
hit something or whatever.
Just really bummed because
that diamond obviously
really meant a lot to me.
I don't even want a new diamond,
I just want that diamond.
I am home now and I have
to break the news to Bryan.
Hey Bryan.
- Yes.
- So, I went riding.
- Tell me all your
problems, lay it all on me.
- I went riding on my horse
today and I lost my diamond.
(laughing)
- It's like a black hole
in the middle of your ring.
- I know, isn't that so sad?
- That is a tragedy.
- I looked everywhere.
- I'm sorry.
- And I even had Maria,
she's checked the arena.
Like all over, since the arena isn't dusty
because it rained, it's pretty firm.
So I was like, "Oh well
maybe it could just
"be sitting on top of the dirt."
But she didn't see it anywhere.
- This is so sad.
- I know, it's my ring.
It's so sad.
Ugh, that's such a bummer.
I mean honestly, it's
pretty crazy that I can lose
such a giant ring, or a giant diamond
and now it's just somewhere.
Like someone could literally just find it.
- They could literally find a diamond,
and it would make their day.
- They could find a diamond
in the middle of a haystack.
(laughing)
- Nursery rhyme coming to life.
- Yeah.
- That's pretty sad.
- I'm so sad, I know.
I'm going to have to wear
some of my other ones
so no one hits on me.
Cause ya know, I gotta
show them I'm married.
(laughing)
- Yeah, for sure.
- I'm so sorry, I'm so sad.
- It's okay.
- Honestly, I've also even lost my watch
while riding the horse.
So clearly I need to
not have anything on me
while I'm taking care of my horse.
Now that I'm home I'm continuing a project
that I started a couple days ago
and it is a mess.
And that is my closet.
So I'm just kind of going
threw and getting rid
of all the clothes I don't wear anymore.
If I haven't worn it in two years,
I probably just get rid of it.
So I got rid of a lot of my
sweaters, a lot of my shirts.
I'm actually gonna have my mom go threw it
and Kelsey go threw it and
then once they go threw it
and get everything they want,
I'm going to donate it all.
And then I'm also getting rid
of a lot of my old T-shirts.
So if you don't know, I'm
a very sentimental person
when it comes to my clothing especially.
And I just had to show
you some of the very,
very old merch from Daily
Bumps that I still have.
And while I do this, Finn is
watching some YouTube videos.
Babysitter YouTube.
- He's watching videos of
people vacuuming on YouTube.
That apparently is a thing now.
- Yeah, that kid's doing chores
you should do chores to, okay?
- Ha.
- Bryan you wanna see
some of our old merch
that I still have?
- Yes, yeah.
- Okay.
- I actually have a ton of shirts myself
that are shirts I've kept from the past.
- Like sentimental?
- Yeah.
- There are a couple in there
that are from high school
and I'm, "Don't get rid of it."
Because I remember him
in it, in high school.
Anyways, here's one of the
very, very first shirts
that we ever released
and that is "HEY!"
- Yes, the "HEY!" Shirt.
We had them printed
locally in a print shop
and we packaged every
single one of them up
and shipped them out to you guys.
- Packaged every single one.
I mean we didn't sell a ton
but there was enough that I was like,
"Okay, never doing that again."
- Yeah, I know, let us
know down in the comments
if you have a "HEY!" shirt
from the good-old days.
- So this one's really old
and some people have
mixed feelings about it,
here we go.
- Oh, is it, the Ollie pop?
I liked the Ollie-Pop.
I liked it, I thought it was cute.
But looking back at it is a little weird.
- Yeah, so if you don't know,
we use to sing Ollie
♪ Ollie Pop, Ollie Pop,
Oh Ollie Ollie Ollie Pop ♪
- The candy that smiles back.
(laughing)
- Yeah, it was a little weird.
We actually sold these,
I'm sure people have them
Here's our old Daily
Bumps merch without Finn.
- Oh yeah, that was with
the littles without Finn.
- There's no Finn, just us.
Oh, this is a good one.
We use to say this all
the time, are you ready?
♪ Boring adult things ♪
- Sometimes you just got
boring adult things to do.
- We haven't said that in so long
but if you guys know this,
let us know down below.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we use to say it all the time.
We'd be like we're doing
"boring adult things," bleh.
I'm doing boring adult
things right now, actually.
Oh, and then we've got this of course.
- Oh, I love this shirt.
Wherever you are, that's where I wanna be.
That was the, this is home shirt.
- Yeah.
- That's a cool one, we
should bring that one back.
- I know.
- Oh babe, you're even
rocking my music merch.
- I know, I've got...
- I've got a true fan
right here look at that,
she's even got the lion shirt.
- I know I've got them
all in different sizes.
I even have some SO CASSIE.
- Oh, CASSIE.
- Hang on.
- CASSIE merch.
- We're going to go through
these quickly, ready?
Dank as Junk.
- Oh, we got Dank as Junk merch!
- Steps to Wander.
- There we go.
(laughing)
She's repping everyone in our closet.
- Oh this from DBECK Summer vacay.
- Oh, that's right, we
had those shirts made.
That was a blast.
- Yeah, they made these for
us, they're really cool.
- Oh, that's so cool.
- Oh, Winter Vacay.
- And then Jared did
the Winter Vacay shirts,
that's so cool.
- Look at this, old Ellie and Jared.
- Oh, look at the giraffe.
- The giraffe.
That was from when Jackson was a baby.
- Yeah, classic.
- And here's an old Ellie and Jared.
- Check it out Ellie and Jared,
we got your first merch
here, that's awesome babe.
- Yeah, I have so many.
I'm like, "I can't get rid of them."
- Yeah.
- Have to keep them all.
- I probably have a ton on my side to.
We'll have to save that for another vlog,
I'll have to show you my merch.
Oh, I have another one, I
have another one you missed!
I have the anchor.
- Oh my gosh,
I don't remember that one!
- With the HEY! Shirts,
- I do remember it.
- We sold them with the HEY! Shirts.
- That was before Ollie was born
because I remember wearing that
before Ollie was born, I think.
- I had these printed locally to,
we packaged them up, I designed it.
- Oh, those are so cute.
- Established 2013, DB.
- I really like that one, I
want that one to come back.
Because I really love the 2013.
- Yeah, cause 2013, that's
when we started to vlog.
- Yeah, I mean, we've done it five years.
- That's amazing.
- Wow, that is so cool, I love that one.
- Oh and of course I've got this one.
- Oh yeah, and I do have
all the new merch as well
but it's hanging in a different closet.
(excited yelling)
Oh, no I have that, I
do, I actually forgot it.
- If you guys don't know
what Fresh Snips is,
it's a song that I wrote with
Jared and Collin, my buddies.
And we did a music video
for it I'm going to have
it linked to the I-card.
- It's so cool.
- Because it was just so much fun.
And that was a long time ago.
- Yeah.
- That's a good little
flash back right there.
Going threw our closets today, I guess.
- Oh, we have so many cool merch.
I can't believe we've been doing merch
for that long, honestly.
There actually is more.
I even have playlist shirts,
I have VidCon shirts,
I have multiple sizes of all those shirts.
Like, it's kind of ridiculous.
Anyways, I have to get back to work.
I am going to finish doing
this, look here's all my hair
and I'm watching Steps to Wander actually.
Okay I have to show you one other thing
and this one is actually going
to be little bit of a quiz.
I'm also a little sentimental
about certain clothing
that I've worn in the
past and I want to know
what very, very special
video did I wear this in?
Can you guys see what it is?
That's what it looks like,
that's actually the front
and that's the back.
Let me know down in the
comments if you know
what video I wore this
in and if you don't know,
probably check the comments
because I'll try to pin the
person who said it right
and you guys can go watch it.
Because it's very, very special
and it's a very old video.
Let me know down below if you know
which one I'm talking about.
Well I think this is all I'm
going to be able to do today.
Oh my gosh, I'm getting rid
of all this, all of this.
I've gone through all my closets.
I'm going through all my jewelry right now
which has been a disaster.
Oh look, this was my grandmas.
Bryan got this for me for
Christmas, he found it for me.
But anyways I still have
to go through all this
and just few more things but
I'm finally getting close
and then I have to do my bathroom.
Oh my gosh, I am such a pack rat guys.
It's ridiculous but yay for
cleaning out your closet.
Ya know what and not a
lot of trash, ya know.
This is as much trash as there was.
Just a lot of clothes
that I don't need anymore.
Don't need to keep around.
A lot of stuff I'm like,
"Oh, it's so hard."
Like I loved wearing
my little Tiger onesie.
I'm sure I have tons of videos in it
but I just can't keep everything.
Alright, I'm off to go pick up Ollie now.
You want to come help me get Ollie?
- Yeah.
- I got to get you dressed, okay?
No more YouTube babysitter, okay?
(laughing)
- Look how handsome these dogs are.
Well handsome and pretty.
(laughing)
They are so cute.
And these boys are having
a little snacky poo.
They already actually had their dinner.
I'm hoping that having a
little snack right before
they go to bed, of course
they'll brush their teeth first,
will make them sleep a little bit longer.
Ollie has had his fair
share of sleeping issues.
With waking up at night
and coming into our room
but he has always been
very good at sleeping in
or at least sleeping to a decent time.
Finn on the other hand,
he wakes up in the middle of the night
but then he doesn't go back to bed.
He likes to wake up at
5:30 every single day.
No matter what I do, whether
I bring him into my bed
or go into his bed and
try to cuddle with him,
he does not fall asleep.
Maybe he's like waking up from hunger,
that I never feed him at that time,
like no, it's the middle of the night.
It's still dark out, we're not eating.
So I'm hoping with a little bit of a snack
will keep him feeling full
through out the night.
Can you please let mama sleep past 5:30?
- No.
(deep sighing)
I may end up having to end up putting Finn
in a different bed, ya know.
- Mhm.
- Would that make you sad or happy?
- Sad.
- Sad.
You guys really like
sleeping together, huh?
- Yeah.
- Well, we'll see, we'll
see if we can fix it, okay?
- Okay.
- Hugs good night.
Hugs good night, I love you.
I love you boys, sleep good okay.
- Okay.
- Alright the boys are going to bed
which means we are not far off.
And look at this little
girl, she just loves
hanging out with me.
Before I end today's
vlog I wanted to mention
that Missy may have called me earlier
to tell me that she lost
the diamond in her ring
and I was super sad for her
but at the same time, I was
so worried when she called,
because she was like really
flustered and talking fast
and I was thinking, "oh
my gosh, are you okay,
"did someone get hurt?"
That's immediately where my mind goes
and so when she tell me, "I
lost the diamond in my ring."
I'm like who cares because
you are healthy and happy
and that's always what's important.
And I want to just let you guys know that.
Things can be replaced and people cannot
which is why it just doesn't really matter
at the end of the day.
It's a bummer and I
feel really bad for her
and maybe she'll have good
luck and be able to find it
but it's a bummer.
Also, for those of you wondering
about our upload schedule
I wanted to give you a
little bit of insight,
we announced about a month ago
that we were going to be making
some changes to the channel,
taking a couple days off a week.
I think we are going to stick
with taking off Tuesdays
and Thursdays, not
uploading on those days.
And just to clarify we
may not be uploading
on Tuesdays and Thursdays
but we are always
filming cool things around this house.
I guarantee you guys aren't
missing much of anything.
Two days a week off has
just been so incredible
for our family and we have been able to be
so much more productive with our time
because we are actually
working on some really cool
big things that will hopefully
be able to go up on days
where we don't put a normal vlog.
I think you're going to start to see some
other cool things on this channel.
So we're working really hard at that
but I just wanted to say a huge thank you
to each and everyone one you,
supporting us through this.
Because we wouldn't be able
to do this without you guys
and your continued support
means the world to us.
We do not take it lightly.
And I'm just so blessed
that we're in a position
like this, to do cool things
and to make fun videos
for you guys, and we're
only getting better.
Alright, we're going to
go to bed now, right Loon?
Loonster?
Okay, thanks for watching guys.
If you guys enjoyed today's video be sure
to give a thumb's up or a pop
and we will see you manana.
You want to give me kisses?
Okay, she wants to give me kisses.
Okay, bye.
(upbeat music)
