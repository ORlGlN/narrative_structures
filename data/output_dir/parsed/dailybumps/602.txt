come and get it get it wherever you are
that's where I wanna be all sad big
Oh
whole driver
good morning guys me and Ally and sin
are headed into swim school and we're
really excited because I think today
always going to pass level two or maybe
he'll be on level two then you'll pass
level two of swim so we're really
excited I hope he does good today
so after a very long internal struggle I
actually showed up to my dentist
appointment today and got my teeth
cleaned
they said everything looked really good
so that's always nice when you go to the
dentist and now I'm meeting the fam for
lunch Ollie just got out of swim class
Ollie would you do it swim class quad
you kicked in the water yeah that's cool
you eaten lunch what'd you get whoa you
got a toy for the secret life of pets
eat your food and then we'll open the
doggy okay okay Finn is wearing a shirt
that says pinch me so I have to pinch
him bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
bitch like can you not this shrimp
burrito I'll pull your logo right now is
poppin you guys look at that goodness
Hollywood you get show me what's his
name no what's his name
hey no say max yeah his name's max so
this is max from the secret life of pets
Olly do you wanna go see that movie yeah
we should go see it huh okay oh is he
licking you do you like Max haha he
licking the camera now
hi max so the other day I made a little
bowl of like fruits veggies blueberries
bananas green bean stuff like that and
then I put water all in it and I froze
it like an ice cube and now I'm going to
take it out to the chicks and let them
peck at it I'll probably cover in a
little bit other food though first that
they know the peck at it cuz I don't
know if they will unless there's like
food on it but I hope they like it
I feel like everything I put in there
they've kind of just like never touched
or anything so maybe if it's like a
little bit of water plus their food
they'll learn that they actually should
pick at it so I guess we'll see cover in
a little bit of chick food mmm all right
what do you guys think of this what do
you think of that
I'm leading an interesting well they
definitely understood well let them tug
at that and I'm gonna clean out their
water all right fresh water cleans food
a little snack they are happy chickens
and then I did end up putting their
water on this just slightly higher like
it's actually on like a little ladder
for them eventually that ladder is used
to go up into here I think that has
helped a lot with them kicking like
sweet like all their shavings and stuff
into the water plus they can still reach
it so that's nice oh my gosh you guys I
have been looking for Ollie everywhere
and I cannot find him and I know this
kid loves to play hide-and-go-seek is he
