good morning guys Missy's off to her six
week postpartum visit actually and she
gave me a chore this morning diapers
baby boy time
he's our son bowling
you do amazing things it's the bridge I
mean I am headed out of town and I'm
actually headed to my doctor's
appointment I'm super looking forward to
it
we're going to find out maybe
specification about my uterus and maybe
if we can fix it and all that stuff so
I'm really really looking forward to
this video our disappointment and then I
will be making a video so hopefully you
guys will get all the details on Friday
back here sleeping okay I have this
mirror set up but I actually can't
really see him because it moved so I'm
kind of bummed about that but it seems
to be happy so right now
of course as the guy I have no idea how
to do this but she left two handy-dandy
little instructions for me so that
should probably do something I did is it
normal that my eyes are burning help me
my mom er actually at the appointment
and all are we still being so good it's
so good I can't believe I'm actually
going to my six-week appointment and
he's six week old I remember always
watching moms come to OB with their
babies I'd be like oh I hope I get to do
that one day
yeah I cannot find my toms anywhere
trying to leave the house can't find my
shoes this always happens
and never take them off in the same
place as these two zerk they're really
thin and they're small so they can get
like kicked under the bed nope what's on
earth Oh hardly anything I gotta say you
guys for an under the bed situation this
is pretty dang good what do we got I got
a thing of mixed nuts no those aren't
screws it with food hdmi cord kit for
parenting yeah we don't need that we
need to learn how to parent pillow pen
that's pretty cool what's under your
guys's bed actually that's pretty funny
you guys screw should go look under your
bed right now and leave in the comments
what's under your bed because a lot of
people like to like - cool you mean you
might put something down there and then
completely forget about it and then look
at me like oh I was looking for that you
know what I mean come on shoes it's done
but I mean I'm sure I didn't get it
zombie I didn't know you liked Selena
Gomez uh yes she's had the Sun is dope
yo na na na when you ready come and get
it
nananana check it out you guys new
vlogging camera came Missi does have one
that's coming too but it's stuck in New
Jersey doing something I don't know
probably like hanging out with a bunch
of people in New York and partying and
stuff we right now we vlog with the elf
110 and it's really it's a really good
camera we're not finding it's as durable
as it needs to be and we want the
quality of the microphone to be a little
bit better because the microphones on
the on the top and so we actually found
I took me a little bit of research but I
found an upgraded version of this that
was just released this year and it's the
elf 330 so I'm gonna look at it oh for
the first two this is what I guess a lot
of vloggers use I just found out Charles
Trippy upgraded to this camera after it
was released
oh it's pretty you guys so it feels
really super durable it's got physical
buttons low ass when I tried it had
touchscreen buttons and that just did
not work at all do not get touchscreen
buttons this one it's slick though
really cool feature about this it's
actually got two microphones it's got
one right there and one right there and
so one is noise cancelling and then the
other ones over normal microphone and
there on the front of the microphone and
see we face the front of the camera so
things should sound a little better in
this thing too so let's give it a whirl
not like a spinning roll like I'm going
to turn it on and record with it
we made and it went fairly well I
we're at information and I can't wait to
actually share it with you but I don't
want so I'm definitely not to make a
video about it so it should be up on
Friday that would be typography guys but
now I'm absolutely starving me I'm
almost starving to death and
all-merciful
he ate right before he loved so we're
good really good this was it I
definitely get nervous about long car
rides with him and he's been super super
good so Wow okay so the responsiveness
on this camera is sick like I push the
record button it's like instantly
recording so that's really good but
right now how do I sound
how do I look is it focused all these
things are important I gotta say just
looking at this thing it is sick you got
it slick look at this thing look at this
thing booyah this is what you guys have
been in but now you're in this it's a
much nicer vessel it's been dropped so
many times its sluggish the screens like
a little loose that it was coming apart
for the longest I am Missy has the same
exact model camera that's coming except
hers is pink I really wanted green but
they don't make green in this model but
definitely dig in the new camera and
like I said it's super responsive super
great quality well I didn't want to ask
you guys a question - we've been
shooting all the vlogs in 720p which
which is high definition but it's not as
high definition as we can we can do
1080p 1080p makes for much larger files
and so it takes a lot more time to
upload but I want to ask you guys what
do you prefer watching in because if I
upload it in 1080p I want you guys to be
able to watch it in 1080p so let me know
in the comments if 720 is fine or if you
would actually prefer 1080p enough
people are requesting 1080p then I'll
start recording in 1080p and then I'll
just upload it and it'll be it'll be
really nice I'm really happy
yay no cameras no cameras yet okay yeah
bubbles bubbles maybe I can laughter is
a beautiful day outside and so we
decided to come out
here and hang out little Oliver is
getting some Sun time a lot of you had
mentioned that if he gets like a little
rash that I should try and put him
outside and he has not a rash but he
just was looking a little red to me and
I thought I should put him in the Sun
and since it's actually a nice day it's
been way too hot to even go near outside
and so really really nice day it's
probably like any eighty so I thought
it'd be perfect and so he's hanging now
having some some Sun time and he's
really enjoying it actually I think he
fell asleep he's taken a nap now you
guys I just did the funniest thing I was
actually checking out a t-shirt place
because I think we're actually gonna
start doing t-shirts I think it's
actually gonna be a possibility so we're
working on that
but I was leaving the t-shirt place and
it's right by this 24-hour like clinic
place and this little old lady came out
and she's like do you know where the
7-eleven is and that's my best
impression of an old black lady by the
way and I was like oh yeah it's kind of
down aways across the freeway and I
showed her where it was on my phone and
she's like alright I'm gonna start
walking there cuz I'm thirsty they ain't
gave me nothing to drink and I'm like oh
my god just lady was so funny and so I
was like oh you're walking I'll give you
a ride so we rode down I get I drove
over to the 7-eleven it was a far
anything and we've all got Slurpees it's
just so nice and kind and it made me
feel it made me feel really good to do
something like that sometimes it's
actually good to just get out of your
skin and out of your comfort zone and
and help someone and even if it's not
totally completely convenient for you
you know anyway I'm done running errands
now and I'm headed home to my bar I I
