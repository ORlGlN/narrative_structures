I really am NOT going I host got it in
their bigger size penis so far okay
look at how stinky poopy is you're
closer there you go
oh we were going to me what you want I
did did you really I did this is all
that I am right now
thanks for my shirt on backwards good
morning guys
fix my shirt I am just noting that I
woke up feeling pretty crappy oh excuse
me I'm gonna try not be annoying about
it but uh yeah I know ah pains but of
course I have work to do and so I
actually had a meeting today so I'm
about to do that on my computer amazing
thing technology I can actually FaceTime
into my meeting which is really cool
because it's important that I be there
but it's also important that I stay and
I'm gonna get better so that I can go to
work tomorrow isn't it a little early
for candy babe oh it's never too early
for candy especially when you're
crashing it huh you someone told us to
watch the the candy crush movie have you
seen it I'm gonna show it to you right
now okay plus my coins nothing like a
deep damage oh my gosh that's so funny
yeah they did a really good job so I'm
really excited right now
I am headed finally to get my hair cut
I've been wanting to do this for like
months but when it comes to like I don't
know taking care of myself when it's
like things like this I just tend to put
it off and put it off mostly good I just
don't like spending the money like I
just hate spending money on things like
that when it's just for myself when
especially when I'm like there's so many
things I need to buy when it comes to
the baby so I'm just like I'll just do
it later get later in so I keep putting
it off until I've got dis horrible dead
ends for hair and I also excited because
I have a new shirt that actually fits I
have plenty of room to grow in it
actually goes below my belly out to
worry about show me big belly alright
once again that's another thing I refuse
to buy is new clothes because I just
believe that I'm going to be having this
baby very very soon and what's the point
in behind
clothes especially maternity clothes
which are expensive for just a couple
more days
hopefully couple more days yeah what
well my plan is hopefully like within
next week your plan yeah I know
feels like it okay I'm ready and we all
know that it's just some more weeks till
he's here since I'm not filling two
Wallace wanted I just had my meeting and
now I have traded in my office for this
and I'm watching Grandma's Boy which is
quite possibly one of the greatest
movies ever I have like a lot of I have
like a small group of movies that I
watched like all the time because
they're hilarious
so yeah Grandma's Boy is definitely one
of those do you guys ever watch
Grandma's Boy I don't know it wasn't
really like a big movie but it's got
like a cult following it did my hair
well I didn't do it but I got my hair
done and I really liked it I decided to
get rid of the straight-across pants if
you can't tell I'm just really bad at
doing it and I just pin it back so I'm
probably gonna go back to growing them
out but for now they're just going to be
to the side or we may just end up paying
the back putting them back if I really
don't want to do them gotta cut a tiny
bit of course I'm not going short ever
again I actually get that question a lot
people ask me if I'm going to do the mom
cut or like get my hair cut really short
and no
I'm not doing that I plan to keep my
hair long for a long time I know that
it's easier when you have a baby but I
really don't want my hair short I
actually my hair is so poofy and like
frizzy that if I were to cut my hair
short I would pretty much have an afro
so I think I'm just gonna stick with my
hair being long but really happy with
this and it's much thinner and healthier
feeling so that I got that done so Bryan
is officially sick so I went ahead and
grabbed him some emergency and some cold
medicine that way he can actually live
in my bedroom without making me want to
puke this Canadians just when he's sick
he is just really second really gross
and he has snot max everywhere not
pretty it's not pretty okay I forgot to
mention to you guys in yesterday's vlog
that I do have a new article up on still
standing it's called you never forget
and it kind of just shared my emotions
of you know taking maternity pictures
and our whole like crazy hectic Hospital
week that we had a couple weeks ago and
so I'm going to throw the link in the
description below go check out the
article included one of Missy's pictures
from a maternity shoot and that's what
it's called and if you guys could click
this button right here it's a little
like button and what that does is it
just spreads the word to other people
who really need to read it because you
know this magazine I think just started
a little over a year ago

there are still a lot of parents out
there who who need this kind of stuff in
their lives definitely check that out
link below is in the description oh my
gosh you guys so we just put our drink
in cup holder and we didn't know that

and we just set it right on on the
thumbtack and know there is soda all
over my mom and all over the car that

soup so I'm eating that because it's
pretty easy on my body and it's pretty
good

stuff emergency I've never used it it
sounds a little scary but I'm gonna try
it and see if it helps supposed to be
dizzy uh this looks like medicine oh
this is weird you guys this is weird I
don't know about this oh it's actually
not that bad

me
yeah can I feel it yeah is it like dry
yeah leave me it's pretty dry you might
get a little bit whoa oh my gosh that's
so cool we're gonna do about three to
four layers right yes that way super
thick so basically all you do is it
comes with these little strips and we
got Cassie on cutting patrol and then
you dip them in the water and then just
smooth them out on the belly yeah you
can do all
different types of like like shapes and
stuff yeah like you can give one like
this one has its ups coming up the side
mm-hmm and then there somewhere you can
do like straps

little bit more yeah
it's weird-feeling yeah getting ready to
pull this bad boy off it's gonna look so
cool look how lopsided is you guys it
actually like is a pretty good rendition
of your belly so we just got done with
the belly cast and we made a mess it is
so bad but this is it it's so
cool-looking right now it's kind of it's
upside down this is what it looks like
on the inside here's what it looks like
it's still a little bit fragile but I
can't believe that like seriously caught
the perfect shape of my belly yeah which
is so hot like lopsided hey now I can
like that's exactly what it's like looks
like it like feels like is like this is
bulging up on top yeah it's just heavy
hmm it's really heavy it's a lot heavier

like a 40 minutes crazy it's like you're
holding up day okay looks like you're
holding it up to you oh yeah I didn't
