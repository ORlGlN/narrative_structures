- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- We're getting ready to take--
(dog barking)
I think someone's here.
I think Tara Lynn's actually here.
But we're actually headed off today.
Right now we're gonna go
to the barn real quick.
But we have a fun day planned.
What are we doing today?
- We're going to go to June's birthday.
- Yeah, it's her birthday party.
But before her birthday party,
we are headed up to the barn.
And Finn is just waking up,
so I have to quickly get him dressed,
head to the barn, and then
we got a party today, yay!
And Finn's up now and all dressed.
- Yeah, good afternoon.
-  Are you gonna go see Nacho?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we are headed up to the barn.
We're just gonna go ride for a little bit
before we gotta head out.
(upbeat music)
- Happy do.
Bye do.
Do.
(laughing)
- What he's trying to say,
over and over again
through all those takes,
is happy birthday, June.
It is June's first birthday
and we are so excited, huh?
- Yeah.
-  Yeah, so we got
her a big present, didn't we?
- Ball.
-  What do you think's in it?
- Ball.
-  A ball?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he's gonna give away her present.
Okay Finn, I have to teach you.
When you go to a birthday party,
you don't tell them what you got.
- Okay.
-  Okay? They have to unwrap it
and then they be surprised, right?
- Okay.
-  So don't tell her
that there's a ball game in there.
- Okay.
-  Okay, high five.
I love you, dude.
- Hey, where's my bow tie?
- I know, I'm sorry.
All he told us today, he
really wants to wear a bow tie
to Juniper's first birthday party.
But we couldn't find one, sorry.
You look really good, though.
- Yeah.
- So the theme is spring.
So we've got some spring colors here.
We've got green, I'm rocking a blue shirt.
I picked up some new clothes yesterday
because all of my clothes
have been fitting really big on me.
My shirts just feel huge.
All my skinny jeans are
basically like regular jeans.
So I had to get some
new clothes yesterday,
and it feels so good to be
wearing smaller clothes again.
Going down a full shirt size,
I was not really expecting, and it's nice.
(upbeat music)
All right, we are now
at Kelsey and Corbyn's.
And it is like one of the
cutest birthday parties ever.
It's spring themed and the
boys are now about to do
a sack race with bunny ears on their head.
This is hilarious.
June, you can be the judge, okay?
Happy birthday, June.
-  Kelsey did such a beautiful job.
-  Go, go, go, go, go!
-  Hop, little bunnies!
-  She ditched the ears.
Go Ollie, go, go, go!
I don't think my son understood the rules.
- Go, Ollie, go, go, Ollie!
-  I'm not sure Ollie
knows what a sack race is.
- He's like, "You're on my team."
- Ollie, you don't run
circles around people.
You're supposed to run to the end, silly.
And also if you wear your rabbit
ears, you'll go way faster.
There you go, now hop, hop, hop.
There you go, oh.
Good try, buddy.
- I really want one of these.
-  I know, they look so yummy.
Look at these cute carrot cake cupcakes.
- No, no, you gotta sing
her Happy Birthday first.
- Ollie, come on.
You are going to be five this summer.
Oh my gosh, I can't believe
those words actually came out of my mouth.
You should know how
birthdays work by now, right?
- Yeah.
- You gotta sing Happy
Birthday and then we eat cake.
How is our son gonna be five this summer?
- I don't want to talk about it.
Is this the birthday girl?
She's like, "I'm so nervous.
"There's so many people here for me."
You want to play in the sand with Finn?
There you go, she's so happy right now.
- Can I take Bunny?
-  All right, we're
having a flower-planting contest.
- Yeah, they get to pick their pot.
-  How cool!
- And now they're putting soil in it,
which is the plant's food.
And then we're gonna
put the flower in there.
-  How neat, Ollie.
You're gonna plant your own flower, fun!
(upbeat music)
Are you all done?
- Yeah.
- Me too.
-  That looks
awesome, good job, Nathan.
-  Good job, boys.
-  That looks so good.
Ollie, did you just win?
- Yeah.
- You won the best plant, good job.
You're taking after your daddy.
You know Daddy loves to plant flowers.
- You did so good, man.
I am very proud of that.
-  I know, look at that.
- He even left a little room
on this side for the butterfly.
- Yeah, you set yourself
apart with that butterfly.
- Good job, dude. Cheers!
So close, try again.
His little face.
I love when he puffs out his cheeks
and is trying to blow it.
(upbeat music)
- One, two, three!
Hurry and jump in.
-  You're getting
faster, Hunter, and higher.
(upbeat music)
- They are literally ridiculous.
She kind of mothers
him, which is hilarious.
She totally bugs him.
She loves him to death.
And he kind of loves her too.
And I just had to show
you Finn cleaning up.
Did you put your shoes away?
What a good little helper.
They both actually put their
shoes away, huh, Ollie?
And now these two are being insane.
But we are home now.
June had such a cute little birthday.
It was so much fun hanging
out for June's birthday, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Did you have fun at June's first birthday?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
You guys were so good.
And they even cleaned up their stuff.
And so guess what?
I have a little surprise for you guys.
- I want to see.
-  Yeah, okay, come here.
Okay, the boys are sitting
at the coffee table
and they are all ready for their surprise.
Ready?
- Yeah.
- Okay, hang on.
All right, guys.
There's a little box up here.
And there's a little
surprise in here, okay?
- Okay.
-  Don't touch, you guys.
Don't touch it, I mean it.
Okay, now listen to me very carefully.
Finn, you listening?
- Yeah.
-  This box says
"Don't touch," okay?
- Okay.
-  So don't touch it.
- What's inside it?
-  I don't know.
- I really want to open it.
- I'll be right back.
- No, no, no, no, don't touch it.
- Can we touch it?
- No, it says don't touch it.
- So I'm watching them
on my phone right now
to see how long they
can go without doing it.
They're actually on the floor now.
Are you gonna touch it?
- I want to touch it.
- I think Ollie won't touch
it, but I think Finn will.
- I want to go and see.
Oh my!
- What does it have on it?
Can we open it up?
- Can we see?
See in--
- Don't touch it!
- That means I can.
- No.
Don't touch it.
(vocalizing)
Don't touch it.
- Yeah.
- It says don't touch it.
-  All right,
how's the surprise going?
- Good.
- Me too.
-  Yeah, has anything happened yet?
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah, are you guys
tempted to press that button?
I don't know.
I don't know what's gonna
happen if you press the button.
I don't know.
What was that?
Finn, I feel like you want
to push that little lever.
You want to go for it?
- Yeah.
-  See what happens.
Okay, go ahead.
What happens?
- Oh.
-  Oh, what are you going to do?
- Push the button.
-  What if you push it up?
- Oh dear!
-  Wait, wait.
- Hi there.
Hi.
- That's funny.
(laughing)
-  He keeps pushing it down.
- Let's see what's gonna happen.
-  He's like, "Stop it."
- Ow!
-  Is that so funny?
- I want to touch it.
I touched it.
-  Don't touch.
(laughing)
- Don't touch it!
-  That orange guy.
- I thought it was a real baby kitty-cat.
-  That was a
really big letdown, huh?
Wasn't a baby kitty-cat, sorry.
Did you guys think that was funny?
- Yeah.
-  You actually did pretty good.
I told you guys not to touch
it and you didn't touch it.
- Yeah.
- What's that?
-  Except Finn got a little daring.
(laughing)
-  Don't touch!
-  That is so cute.
- He's touching my box, don't touch it!
(upbeat music)
- Wasn't that so cool, dude?
- Yeah.
- Did you expect a little
kitty to pop out of that box?
- Mm-hmm.
- You did?
You just think any type of
box gets put in front of you,
there's a kitty in it?
(laughing)
I think this is an important
lesson for the kids to learn,
that you should not push buttons
that you don't know what they do, huh?
- Yeah.
- 'Cause you never know
what a button could do.
You have to be careful.
- Yeah, thanks for watching today's video.
- That's right, thanks for watching.
If you guys enjoyed this video,
be sure to give it a big thumbs-up.
Thumbs-up, subscribe, and
we will see you guys later.
- Later.
- Say "Bye!"
- Bye!
